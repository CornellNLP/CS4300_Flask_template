PRE-INTRO SCENE: CENTRAL PERK  
 PHOEBE: (ENTERING) Hi guys! 
 ALL: Hey, Pheebs! Hi! 
 ROSS: Hey. Oh, oh, how'd it go?  
 PHOEBE: Um, not so good. He walked me to the subway and said 'We should do this again!' 
 ALL: Ohh. Ouch. 
 RACHEL: What? He said 'we should do it again', that's good, right? 
 MONICA: Uh, no. Loosely translated 'We should do this again' means 'You will never see me naked'.  
 RACHEL: Since when? 
 JOEY: Since always. It's like dating language. Y'know, like 'It's not you' means 'It is you'. 
 CHANDLER: Or 'You're such a nice guy' means 'I'm gonna be dating leather-wearing alcoholics and complaining about them to you'.  
 PHOEBE: Or, or, y'know, um, 'I think we should see other people' means 'Ha, ha, I already am'. 
 RACHEL: And everybody knows this? 
 JOEY: Yeah. Cushions the blow. 
 CHANDLER: Yeah, it's like when you're a kid, and your parents put your dog to sleep, and they tell you it went off to live on some farm. 
 ROSS: That's funny, that, no, because, uh, our parents actually did, uh, send our dog off to live on a farm. 
 MONICA: Uh, Ross. 
 ROSS: What? Wh- hello? The Millners' farm in Connecticut? The Millners, they had this unbelievable farm, they had horses, and, and rabbits that he could chase and it was- it w- .....Oh my God, Chi Chi! 
 (INTRO) 
 SCENE 1: CHANDLER AND JOEY'S APARTMENT. (JOEY IS REHEARSING A PART; CHANDLER READS THE OTHER PART FROM A SCRIPT) 
 CHANDLER: "So how does it feel knowing you're about to die?" 
 JOEY: "Warden, in five minutes my pain will be over. But you'll have to live with the knowledge that you sent an honest man to die." 
 CHANDLER: Hey, that was really good!  
 JOEY: Thanks! Let's keep going. 
 CHANDLER: Okay. "So. Whaddya want from me, Damone, huh?" 
 JOEY: "I just wanna go back to my cell. 'Cause in my cell, I can smoke." 
 CHANDLER: "Smoke away." 
 (JOEY TAKES OUT A PACKET OF CIGARETTES AND A LIGHTER. HE FUMBLES AND DROPS THE LIGHTER. THEN HE LIGHTS A CIGARETTE, TAKES A DRAG AND COUGHS) 
 CHANDLER: I think this is probably why Damone smokes in his cell alone. 
 JOEY: What? 
 CHANDLER: Relax your hand! 
 (JOEY LETS HIS WRIST GO LIMP) 
 CHANDLER: Not so much! 
 JOEY: Whoah! 
 CHANDLER: Hey! 
 JOEY: Hey! 
 CHANDLER: Alright, now try taking a puff. 
 (JOEY TRIES AND VISIBLY WINCES) 
 CHANDLER: Alright.. okay. No. Give it to me. 
 JOEY: No no no, I am not giving you a cigarette. 
 CHANDLER: It's fine, it's fine. Look, do you wanna get this part, or not? Here. 
 (JOEY RELUCTANTLY GIVES HIM THE CIGARETTE) 
 CHANDLER: Don't think of it as a cigarette. Think of it as the thing that's been missing from your hand. When you're holding it, you feel right. You feel complete. 
 JOEY: Y'miss it? 
 CHANDLER: Nah, not so much. Alright, now we smoke. (TAKES A PUFF) Oh.. my.. God. (CONTINUES TO SMOKE) 
 SCENE 2: CENTRAL PERK(ALL PRESENT EXCEPT RACHEL AND PHOEBE) 
 MONICA: No, no, no. They say it's the same as the distance from the tip of a guy's thumb to the tip of his index finger. 
 (THE GUYS STRETCH OUT THEIR FINGERS) 
 JOEY: That's ridiculous! 
 ROSS: Can I use.. either thumb? 
 RACHEL: (BRINGING DRINKS) Alright, don't tell me, don't tell me! (HANDING THEM OUT) Decaf cappucino for Joey.. Coffee black.. Late.. And an iced tea. I'm getting pretty good at this! 
 ALL: Yeah. Yeah, excellent. 
 RACHEL: (LEAVING TO SERVE OTHERS) Good for me! 
 (THE GANG SWAP ROUND ALL THE DRINKS) 
 (ENTER PHOEBE, MUTTERING. SHE SITS DOWN WITHOUT SAYING HI) 
 JOEY: Y'okay, Phoebe? 
 PHOEBE: Yeah- no- I'm just- it's, I haven't worked- It's my bank. 
 MONICA: What did they do to you? 
 PHOEBE: It's nothing, it's just- Okay. I'm going through my mail, and I open up their monthly, you know, STATEMENT- 
 ROSS: Easy. 
 PHOEBE: - and there's five hundred extra dollars in my account. 
 CHANDLER: Oh, Satan's minions at work again... 
 PHOEBE: Yes, 'cause now I have to go down there, and deal with them. 
 JOEY: What are you talking about? Keep it! 
 PHOEBE: It's not mine, I didn't earn it, if I kept it, it would be like stealing. 
 RACHEL: Yeah, but if you spent it, it would be like shopping! 
 PHOEBE: Okay. Okay, let's say I bought a really great pair of shoes. Do you know what I'd hear, with every step I took? 'Not-mine. Not-mine. Not-mine.' And even if I was happy, okay, and, and skipping- 'Not-not-mine, not-not-mine, not-not-mine, not-not-mine'... 
 MONICA: We're with you. We got it. 
 (CHANDLER LEANS OVER THE BACK OF THE COUCH, OUT OF SIGHT) 
 PHOEBE: Okay. I'd- just- I'd never be able to enjoy it. It would be like this giant karmic debt. 
 RACHEL: Chandler, what are you doing? 
 MONICA: (PULLING HIM UP) Hey. Whaddya doing? 
 (CHANDLER TRIES TO SHRUG NONCHALANTLY BUT EVENTUALLY HE HAS TO EXHALE A MOUTHFUL OF SMOKE) 
 ALL: Oh! Oh, God! 
 ROSS: What is this?! 
 CHANDLER: I'm smoking. I'm smoking, I'm smoking. 
 PHOEBE: Oh, I can't believe you! You've been so good, for three years! 
 CHANDLER: And this- is my reward! 
 ROSS: Hold on a second, alright? Just think about what you went through the last time you quit. 
 CHANDLER: Okay, so this time I won't quit! 
 ALL: Ohhh! Put it out! 
 CHANDLER: All right! I'm putting it out, I'm putting it out. (HE DROPS IT IN PHOEBE'S COFFEE) 
 PHOEBE: Oh, no! I- I can't drink this now! 
 MONICA: Alright. I'm gonna go change, I've got a date. 
 RACHEL: This Alan again? How's it goin'? 
 MONICA: 'S'going pretty good, y'know? It's nice, and, we're having fun. 
 JOEY: So when do we get to meet the guy? 
 MONICA: Let's see, today's Monday... Never. 
 ALL: Oh, come on! Come on! 
 MONICA: No. Not after what happened with Steve. 
 CHANDLER: What are you talking about? We love Schhteve! Schhteve was schhexy!.. Sorry. 
 MONICA: Look, I don't even know how I feel about him yet. Just give me a chance to figure that out. 
 RACHEL: Well, then can we meet him? 
 MONICA: Nope. Schhorry. 
 SCENE 3: IRIDIUM (MONICA AND PAULA ARE AT WORK) 
 MONICA: I mean, why should I let them meet him? I mean, I bring a guy home, and within five minutes they're all over him. I mean, they're like- coyotes, picking off the weak members of the herd. 
 PAULA: Listen. As someone who's seen more than her fair share of bad beef, I'll tell you: that is not such a terrible thing. I mean, they're your friends, they're just looking out after you. 
 MONICA: I know. I just wish that once, I'd bring a guy home that they actually liked. 
 PAULA: Well, you do realise the odds of that happening are a little slimmer if they never get to meet the guy.. 
 (CUT TO RACHEL+MONICA'S APARTMENT. CHANDLER IS SMOKING ON THE BALCONY, PHOEBE IS ABSENT) 
 JOEY: Let it go, Ross.  
 ROSS: Yeah, well, you didn't know Chi Chi. 
 MONICA: Do you all promise? 
 ALL: Yeah! We promise! We'll be good! 
 MONICA: (SHOUTS TO CHANDLER) Chandler? Do you promise to be good? 
 (CHANDLER MAKES A 'CROSS MY HEART' SIGN. IT STARTS TO RAIN AND CHANDLER TAPS ON THE WINDOW) 
 JOEY: You can come in, but your filter-tipped little buddy has to stay outside! 
 (CHANDLER SULKILY PICKS UP A GARBAGE CAN LID AND SHELTERS HIMSELF UNDER IT) 
 (ENTER PHOEBE. SHE STRIDES TO THE COUCH, SITS DOWN AND BEGINS TO READ WITHOUT SAYING HI) 
 ROSS: Hey, Pheebs. 
 PHOEBE: 'Dear Ms. Buffay. Thank you for calling attention to our error. We have credited your account with five hundred dollars. We're sorry for the inconvenience, and hope you'll accept this- (SEARCHES IN HER PURSE) -football phone as our free gift.' Do you believe this?! Now I have a thousand dollars, and a football phone!  
 RACHEL: What bank is this? 
 (DOOR BUZZER) 
 MONICA: Hey. It's him. (TO INTERCOM) Who is it? 
 ALAN (INTERCOM): It's Alan. 
 JOEY: (SHOUTS TO CHANDLER) Chandler! He's here! 
 (CHANDLER COMES IN, DRIPPING WET) 
 MONICA: (TO ALL) Okay, please be good, please. Just remember how much you all like me. 
 (OPENS THE DOOR- ENTER ALAN) 
 MONICA: Hi. Alan, this is everybody. Everybody, this is Alan. 
 ALAN: Hi. 
 ALL: Hi, Alan. 
 ALAN: I've heard schho much about all you guyschh! 
 (GENERAL HYSTERIA) 
 SCENE 4: RACHEL+ MONICA'S (LATER IN THE EVENING) 
 MONICA: (AT THE DOOR, TO ALAN, WHO IS LEAVING) Thanks. I'll call you tomorrow. (TO ALL) Okay. Okay, let's let the Alan-bashing begin. Who's gonna take the first shot, hmm? 
 (SILENCE) 
 MONICA: C'mon! 
 ROSS: ...I'll go. Let's start with the way he kept picking at- no, I'm sorry, I can't do this, can't do this. We loved him. 
 ALL: Loved him! Yeah! He's great! 
 MONICA: Wait a minute! We're talking about someone that I'm going out with? 
 ALL: Yeah!  
 RACHEL: And did you notice...? (SPREADS HER THUMB AND INDEX FINGER) 
 THE GUYS: (RELUCTANTLY) Yeah. 
 JOEY: Know what was great? The way his smile was kinda crooked. 
 PHOEBE: Yes, yes! Like the man in the shoe! 
 ROSS: ...What shoe? 
 PHOEBE: From the nursery rhyme. 'There was a crooked man, Who had a crooked smile, Who lived in a shoe, For a... while...' 
 (DUBIOUS PAUSE) 
 ROSS: ...So I think Alan will become the yardstick against which all future boyfriends will be measured. 
 RACHEL: What future boyfriends? Nono, I th- I think this could be, y'know, it. 
 MONICA: Really! 
 CHANDLER: Oh, yeah. I'd marry him just for his David Hasselhof impression alone. You know I'm gonna be doing that at parties, right? (DOES IT) 
 ROSS: You know what I like most about him, though? 
 ALL: What? 
 ROSS: The way he makes me feel about myself. 
 ALL: Yeah... 
 (AD BREAK) 
 SCENE 5: CENTRAL PERK(MONICA ALONE. ENTER ROSS, RACHEL, CHANDLER AND JOEY, DEJECTEDLY, IN SOFTBALL GEAR) 
 MONICA: Hi.. how was the game? 
 ROSS: Well.. 
 ALL: WE WON!! Thank you! Yes! 
 MONICA: Fantastic! I have one question: How is that possible? 
 JOEY: Alan. 
 ROSS: He was unbelievable. He was like that-that-that Bugs Bunny cartoon where Bugs is playing all the positions, right, but instead of Bugs it was first base-Alan, second base-Alan, third base-... 
 RACHEL: I mean, it-it was like, it was like he made us into a team. 
 CHANDLER: Yep, we sure showed those Hassidic jewellers a thing or two about softball.. 
 MONICA: Can I ask you guys a question? D'you ever think that Alan is maybe.. sometimes.. 
 ROSS: What? 
 MONICA: ..I dunno, a little too Alan? 
 RACHEL: Well, no. That's impossible. You can never be too Alan. 
 ROSS: Yeah, it's his, uh, innate Alan-ness that-that-that we adore. 
 CHANDLER: I personally could have a gallon of Alan. 
 (CUT TO A STREET WHERE LIZZIE IS RESTING. PHOEBE WALKS UP TO HER) 
 PHOEBE: Hey, Lizzie. 
 LIZZIE: Hey, Weird Girl. 
 PHOEBE: I brought you alphabet soup. 
 LIZZIE: Did you pick out the vowels? 
 PHOEBE: Yes. But I left in the Ys. 'Cause, y'know, "sometimes y". Uh, I also have something else for you. (SEARCHES IN HER PURSE) 
 LIZZIE: Saltines? 
 PHOEBE: No, but would you like a thousand dollars and a football phone? 
 LIZZIE: What? (OPENS THE ENVELOPE PHOEBE HAS GIVEN HER) Oh my God, there's really money in here. 
 PHOEBE: I know. 
 LIZZIE: Weird Girl, what are you doing? 
 PHOEBE: No, I want you to have it. I don't want it. 
 LIZZIE: No, no, I ha-I have to give you something. 
 PHOEBE: Oh, that's fine, no. 
 LIZZIE: Would you like my tin-foil hat? 
 PHOEBE: No. 'Cause you need that. No, it's okay, thanks. 
 LIZZIE: Please, let me do something. 
 PHOEBE: Okay, alright, you buy me a soda, and then we're even. Okay? 
 LIZZIE: Okay. 
 PHOEBE: Okay. 
 (CUT TO CHANDLER'S OFFICE BLOCK) 
 (CHANDLER LOOKS ROUND, THEN OPENS HIS DESK DRAWER AND TAKES A PUFF OF A CIGARETTE. THEN HE SPRAYS AROUND SOME AIR FRESHENER AND TAKES SOME BREATH SPRAY. HE TYPES FOR A MOMENT. THEN HE OPENS THE DRAWER AGAIN AND TAKES ANOTHER PUFF. NOT PAYING ATTENTION, HE SPRAYS THE BREATH SPRAY AROUND THE ROOM, TAKES A SQUIRT OF AIR FRESHENER AND GAGS) 
 (CUT TO PHOEBE AND LIZZIE AT A SODA STAND) 
 LIZZIE: Keep the change. (TO PHOEBE) Sure you don't wanna pretzel? 
 PHOEBE: No, I'm fine. 
 LIZZIE: (LEAVING) See ya. 
 (PHOEBE OPENS THE CAN AND REACTS) 
 PHOEBE: Huh! 
 (CUT TO CENTRAL PERK) 
 ROSS: A thumb?! 
 (PHOEBE NODS) 
 ALL: Eww! 
 PHOEBE: I know! I know, I opened it up and there it was, just floating in there, like this tiny little hitch-hiker! 
 CHANDLER: Well, maybe it's a contest, y'know? Like, collect all five? 
 PHOEBE: Does, um, anyone wanna see? 
 ALL: Nooo!  
 (CHANDLER LIGHTS A CIGARETTE)  
 ALL: Oh, hey, don't do that! Cut it out! 
 RACHEL: It's worse than the thumb! 
 CHANDLER: Hey, this is so unfair! 
 MONICA: Oh, why is it unfair? 
 CHANDLER: So I have a flaw! Big deal! Like Joey's constant knuckle-cracking isn't annoying? And Ross, with his over-pronouncing every single word? And Monica, with that snort when she laughs? I mean, what the hell is that thing? ...I accept all those flaws, why can't you accept me for this? 
 (UNCOMFORTABLE SILENCE) 
 JOEY: ...Does the knuckle-cracking bother everybody? 
 RACHEL: Well, I-I could live without it. 
 JOEY: Well, is it, like, a little annoying, or is it like when Phoebe chews her hair? 
 (PHOEBE SPITS OUT HER HAIR) 
 ROSS: Oh, now, don't listen to him, Pheebs, I think it's endearing. 
 JOEY: Oh, (IMITATING ROSS) "you do, do you"? 
 (MONICA LAUGHS AND SNORTS) 
 ROSS: You know, there's nothing wrong with speaking correctly. 
 RACHEL: "Indeed there isn't"... I should really get back to work. 
 PHOEBE: Yeah, 'cause otherwise someone might get what they actually ordered. 
 RACHEL: Ohh-ho-hooohhh. The hair comes out, and the gloves come on. 
 (THEY DEGENERATE INTO BICKERING AND CHANDLER HAPPILY STARTS TO SMOKE, UNDISTURBED.) 
 
 
 
 SCENE 6: IRIDIUM (AGAIN, MONICA AND PAULA AT WORK) 
 MONICA: Did you ever go out with a guy your friends all really like? 
 PAULA: No.  
 MONICA: Okay.. Well, I'm going out with a guy my friends all really like.  
 PAULA: Waitwait.. we talking about the coyotes here? All right, a cow got through! 
 MONICA: Can you believe it? ...Y'know what? I just don't feel the thing. I mean, they feel the thing, I don't feel the thing. 
 PAULA: Honey.. you should always feel the thing. Listen, if that's how you feel about the guy, Monica, dump him! 
 MONICA: I know.. it's gonna be really hard. 
 PAULA: Well, he's a big boy, he'll get over it. 
 MONICA: No, he'll be fine. It's the other five I'm worried about. 
 (CUT TO CENTRAL PERK, WHERE JOEY AND ROSS ARE PERSECUTING CHANDLER) 
 JOEY: Do you have any respect for your body? 
 ROSS: Don't you realise what you're-you're doing to yourself? 
 CHANDLER: Hey, y'know, I have had it with you guys and your cancer and your emphysema and your heart disease. The bottom line is, smoking is cool, and you know it. 
 RACHEL: (WITH PHONE) Chandler? It's Alan, he wants to speak to you. 
 CHANDLER: Really? He does? (TAKES PHONE) Hey, buddy, what's up! Oh, she told you about that, huh. Well, yeah, I have one now and then. Well, yeah, now. Well, it's not that big- ..well, that's true,.. Gee, y'know, no-one- no-one's ever put it like that before. Well, okay, thanks! (HANDS BACK THE PHONE AND STUBS OUT HIS CIGARETTE)  
 RACHEL: (TO ROSS, WHO HAS WANDERED UP) God, he's good. 
 ROSS: If only he were a woman. 
 RACHEL: Yeah.  
 (THEY GIVE EACH OTHER A DUBIOUS LOOK) 
 (CUT TO THE GANG MINUS MONICA AND JOEY WATCHING LAMBCHOP AT RACHEL+ MONICA'S) 
 CHANDLER: Ooh, Lambchop. How old is that sock? If I had a sock on my hand for thirty years it'd be talking too. 
 ROSS: Okay. I think it's time to change somebody's nicotine patch. (DOES SO) 
 (ENTER MONICA) 
 MONICA: Hey. Where's Joey? 
 CHANDLER: Joey ate my last stick of gum, so I killed him. Do you think that was wrong? 
 RACHEL: I think he's across the hall. 
 MONICA: Thanks. (GOES TO FETCH HIM) 
 ROSS: (FINISHES CHANGING CHANDLER'S NICOTINE PATCH) There y'go. 
 CHANDLER: (DEADPAN) Ooh, I'm alive with pleasure now. 
 ROSS: Hey Pheebs, you gonna have the rest of that Pop-Tart?.. Pheebs? 
 PHOEBE: Does anyone want the rest of this Pop-Tart? 
 ROSS: Hey, I might! 
 PHOEBE: Sorry. ..Y'know, those stupid soda people gave me seven thousand dollars for the thumb. 
 ALL: You're kidding. Oh my God. 
 PHOEBE: And on my way over here, I stepped in gum. ...What is up with the universe?! 
 JOEY: (DRAGGED IN BY MONICA. HE HAS JUST COME OUT OF THE SHOWER) What's going on? 
 MONICA: Nothing. I just think it's nice when we're all here together. 
 JOEY: Even nicer when everyone gets to wear their underwear.. 
 RACHEL: Uh, Joey.. 
 JOEY: Oh, God! (HURRIEDLY CLOSES HIS KNEES)  
 MONICA: (TURNS OFF TV) Okay.. 
 ALL: Oh! That was Lambchop! 
 MONICA: Please, guys, we have to talk. 
 PHOEBE: Wait, wait, I'm getting a deja vu...no, I'm not. 
 MONICA: Alright, we have to talk. 
 PHOEBE: There it is! 
 MONICA: Okay. It's-it's about Alan. There's something that you should know. I mean, there's really no easy way to say this.. uh.. I've decided to break up with Alan. 
 (THEY ALL GASP AND CLUTCH EACH OTHER) 
 ROSS: Is there somebody else? 
 MONICA: No, nononono.. it's just.. things change. People change. 
 RACHEL: We didn't change.. 
 JOEY: So that's it? It's over? Just like that? 
 PHOEBE: You know.. you let your guard down, you start to really care about someone, and I just- I- (CHEWS HER HAIR) 
 MONICA: Look, I- I could go on pretending- 
 JOEY: Okay! 
 MONICA: -but that wouldn't be fair to me, it wouldn't be fair to Alan- It wouldn't be fair to you! 
 ROSS: Who-who wants fair? Y'know, I just want things back. Y'know, the way they were. 
 MONICA: I'm sorry.. 
 CHANDLER: (SARCASTIC) Oh, she's sorry! I feel better! 
 RACHEL: (TEARFUL) I just can't believe this! I mean, with the holidays coming up- I wanted him to meet my family- 
 MONICA: I'll meet somone else. There'll be other Alans. 
 ALL: Oh, yeah! Right! 
 MONICA: Are you guys gonna be okay? 
 ROSS: Hey hey, we'll be fine. We're just gonna need a little time. 
 MONICA: (DUBIOUS) I understand. 
 (CUT TO MONICA TELLING ALAN IN A RESTAURANT) 
 ALAN: Wow.  
 MONICA: I'm, I'm really sorry. 
 ALAN: Yeah, I'm sorry too. But, I gotta tell you, I am a little relieved.  
 MONICA: Relieved? 
 ALAN: Yeah, well, I had a great time with you.. I just can't stand your friends. 
 (CLOSING CREDITS) 
 CREDITS SCENE: RACHEL + MONICA'S (THE GANG ARE MOPING AROUND, EATING ICE CREAM) 
 RACHEL: Remember when we went to Central Park and rented boats?.. That was fun. 
 ROSS: Yeah. He could row like a viking. 
 (ENTER MONICA) 
 MONICA: Hi. 
 ALL: Mmm.  
 ROSS: So how'd it go? 
 MONICA: Oh, y'know.. 
 PHOEBE: Did he mention us? 
 MONICA: He said he's really gonna miss you guys. (DUBIOUS LOOK) 
 ROSS: You had a rough day, huh.. c'mere. (SHE SITS DOWN AND ROSS STROKES HER FOREHEAD) 
 CHANDLER: ...That's it. I'm getting cigarettes. 
 ALL: No no no! 
 CHANDLER: (LEAVING) I don't care, I don't care! Game's over! I'm weak! I've gotta smoke! I've gotta have the smoke! 
 PHOEBE: (SHOUTS AS HE LEAVES) If you never smoke again I'll give you seven thousand dollars! 
 CHANDLER: (REENTERING) Yeah, alright.
