 Previously on "All American" LAYLA: Helping Coop and Patience on that track really felt good. 
  There's something special there, but I got mad artists like Coop already on my label. 
  What I don't have is someone like Patience. 
  Jordan's got a girl pregnant. 
  She's about to have your child. 
  Make her feel supported through this. 
  BILLY: I know I have not been the husband that you deserve. 
  Give me one more chance. 
  Let me make this right. 
  ASH: If you don't want me to kiss you, please say something now. 
  OLIVIA: Hooking up made things weird between us, 'cause you're my best friend. 
  I need that more than I need a boyfriend. 
  This is gonna be our last weekend together as a family. 
  Dad! 
  COREY: Let's make it count. 
  WOMAN: I wonder if you knew How much I loved you I wonder if you knew How much I needed you Now every time that I held back I wish I could step into the past And change that I should have held you so tight Instead of pushing your hand away I should have been by your side When you asked me if I could stay DILLON: Where's his headstone? 
  SPENCER: It's only been two weeks, man. 
  They're still working on it. 
  WOMAN: Have to be this way DILLON: We'll come back and see it? 
  As much as you want. 
  We was just starting to get to know each other again. 
  And we finally went fishing that last night at the cabin. 
  Did he give you his lecture about practicing Patience? 
  Oh, yeah. 
  I got the famous speech. 
  How fishing ain't really about fishing. 
  Yeah. 
  Hey, maybe the 3 of us can go sometime. 
  You could tell us some more stories about him. 
  Yeah. 
  How'd it go? 
  Still no headstone. 
  It'll be there real soon, baby. 
  Mwah! 
  Billy called. 
  Do you know what tomorrow is? 
  SPENCER: Sunday? 
  GRACE: The National Player Ranking comes out. 
  He says you have a good chance of making the top 300 list. 
  I'm trying not to think about it. 
  You're a lock to make that list, Bro. 
  DILLON: Shouldn't you be on it, too? 
  I mean, you're a big deal in Nevada. 
  Wouldn't that be something? 
  Both of you, top 300 players in the country? 
  Whoooo! 
  Honestly, it wouldn't matter much for me. 
  Wouldn't matter? 
  You make that list, every college in the country gonna be coming after you. 
  Yeah, not if I don't play next year. 
  What are you talking about? 
  [KNOCK ON DOOR] 
  Hey. 
  Wish I could say I don't know what you're going through, but I do. 
  I'm really sorry, Spencer. 
  First time he left, it hurt. 
  I mean, I felt his absence for years, but he was still out there, you know? 
  But now this time, it's Permanent. 
  Yeah. 
  There's just so much I still want to talk to him about, things I want to ask him, and I can't. 
  The hardest part. 
  I mean, it was for me. 
  I still have questions I want to ask my mom. 
  Hey. 
  You're gonna be OK, Spencer. 
  - SPENCER: When? 
  - LAYLA: Eventually. 
  OK. 
  So, what do I do until then? 
  I can tell you what worked for me. 
  At this point, I'm willing to try anything. 
  I just pushed it away. 
  The pain. 
  There's a void in your life right now and you just need to figure out ways to fill it. 
  - SPENCER: With what? 
  - LAYLA: Anything positive. 
  Distractions. 
  Isn't there a Ring Ceremony for the State Championships this week? 
  Yeah. 
  And the National Player Rankings come out tomorrow. 
  I was trying not to think about it, but maybe it is a good distraction. 
  Push away the pain. 
  Fill the void. 
  I know it's not easy, but I promise, eventually It'll get better. 
  Yeah, uh That is how you They want a little bit But I'm too complex, the haunt's A riddled skit inside of my mindset OK, OK, look who decided to make a comeback. 
  Uh, we're not together-together, we're just here as friends. 
  Ahem. 
  Thank you for making it weird. 
  Listen, I'm just rootin' for y'all. 
  That's all. 
  Yeah, I'll be right back. 
  Hey, yo, Preach. 
  Yo, I got some new tracks for you. 
  - PREACH: Why you telling me? 
  - COOP: You told me to let you know when I got some new music. 
  And how long ago was that? 
  Look, this ain't just something I could snap my fingers and it'd be done. 
  It take time to get this right. 
  They any good? 
  That's what I'm saying. 
  I was hoping you'd tell me. 
  PATIENCE: So I've just been pretty busy with, you know, school and choir practice. 
  I was wondering why I hadn't seen you around my dad's studio. 
  But I can still set up a time for you to come in and meet him. 
  Just let me know what works for you. 
  Am I missing something? 
  Yeah, what are you talking about? 
  No, Coop played my dad their demo, and he loved Patience's voice. 
  Did she not? 
  He, like, wants to work with you. 
  He thinks you're a star. 
  Yeah, I don't know. 
  Maybe she just forgot to tell me. 
  BILLY: Whoa. 
  What am I looking at here? 
  Well, this is a crib, or at least it will be. 
  - JORDAN: You want to help? 
  - BILLY: Absolutely not. 
  Uh, heh heh! 
  I wouldn't know where to start. 
  [SIGHS] 
  How am I supposed to do this, Dad? 
  Ah. 
  You'll figure it out. 
  I wasn't talking about the crib. 
  I know. 
  You'll figure it out. 
  You're not alone in this, Son. 
  I got you something. 
  - JORDAN: What is it? 
  A watch? 
  - BILLY: Yeah. 
  Really? 
  [WATCH RATTLES] 
  Is it broken? 
  Probably, but don't shake it like that. 
  It's sort of a family heirloom. 
  When I was born, my granddaddy gave it to my dad, and he gave it to me when you and Olivia were born. 
  Now it's yours. 
  Someday, you'll give it to your firstborn. 
  SPENCER: Aah! 
  BILLY: There he is. 
  You pushing yourself too hard? 
  Coach. 
  Just trying to keep my mind busy. 
  I just stopped by, check up on you, see how you were doing, and give you some news. 
  I got a sneak peek at the top 300 list, and you are on it. 
  You know, that's a big deal. 
  Congratulations, Spencer. 
  Darnell's on it, too. 
  I know Corey'll be proud of you both. 
  All right, so what now? 
  [CHUCKLES] 
  Uh, enjoy it. 
  No, I mean what's the next step? 
  Come on, Man. 
  I just need something to focus on. 
  Well, I'm not the only person that got a sneak peek at that list. 
  College coaches started calling me, trying to get next to you, but I told them about your father and that you needed time. 
  No, I don't need no time, Coach. 
  Whoa, whoa, Spencer, there's no rush. 
  You have plenty of time to make this decision. 
  Look, I appreciate you, all right? 
  I do. 
  But this right here is a good distraction for me right now, so please set the meeting. 
  The sooner the better. 
  [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] 
  GRACE: Thanks for coming over to celebrate my baby boy and 57th-ranked football player in the nation! 
  ALL: Whoo! 
  57th? 
  Damn, Bro! 
  You know how many players there are in the country? 
  - SPENCER: Naw. 
  How many? 
  - COOP: I don't know. 
  That was a serious question. 
  Somebody should really look it up. 
  OLIVIA: Over a million. 
  DILLON: Wow! 
  For real? 
  BILLY: We're all very proud of you, Spencer. 
  Very proud. 
  OK, let's cut some cake. 
  - DILLON: Yeah, let's do it. 
  - GRACE: All right, everybody [VOICES FADE] 
  BILLY: Hey, look, I want that quarter GRACE: Baby. 
  You OK? 
  Yeah. 
  I just wish he knew. 
  He does know, and right now he's got that great big smile on his face. 
  I'm gonna go get some plates. 
  COOP: Yo, I said I'd think about it. 
  All right. 
  Preach want me to do a mixtape release party at the cafe, saying I need to get my name out there. 
  - Ain't that what you want? 
  - Yeah, but I just don't think the tracks is ready yet. 
  Is this because of what Layla's pops said? 
  J. P. liked the tracks. 
  Yeah, but he loved Patience, right? 
  Wants to work with her? 
  You left that part out. 
  I guess I forgot to tell her. 
  Look, you say you forgot, I believe you, all right? 
  But you got to believe in yourself, Coop. 
  I think preach is right. 
  This could be an opportunity to make something happen, but you got to take a chance, a'ight? 
  What's a child that's got a song OLIVIA: Thank you. 
  You know I hate the taste of coffee, but I can't seem to function without the effects. 
  Thanks again for meeting me, Olivia. 
  I know how busy you are. 
  I'm a teenager, Gwen. 
  As a collective, we're not that busy. 
  Well, Asher sure seems to be busy. 
  Well, he has football, so he's busier. 
  Come on. 
  We both know he's been avoiding me, which is why I've asked you here, and no one knows Asher better than you do. 
  What can I do to get him back? 
  Look, this past year has been really rough for Asher, and he needed his mom, so maybe just try to help him understand why you abandoned him. 
  Olivia, I would never willingly walk away from my son. 
  It was out of my control. 
  What, did someone have a gun to your head? 
  No, not exactly. 
  It's just I couldn't What? 
  Tell me. 
  Maybe I can help. 
  I Look, Olivia, um, this is between me and Asher's dad. 
  I'm sorry I wasted your time. 
  Thank you for meeting me. 
  JORDAN: Here we go, here we go. 
  Right. 
  Right turn, right turn. 
  If I fall, I swear You're not gonna fall. 
  I promise. 
  Wait. 
  Why didn't you just ask me to close my eyes, Jordan? 
  That would have made more sense. 
  OK. 
  Ready and ta-da! 
  Jordan, what is this? 
  Room for our baby. 
  OK, look, full disclosure. 
  Olivia figured out how to put the crib together, but I handed her the pieces, so joint effort. 
  - It's perfect. 
  - And this empty bookshelf will be filled with books. 
  Getting those today. 
  This chair here, comfiest chair ever to read in. 
  Still don't know how I feel about the horse, but it's here. 
  We can figure that out later. 
  Look, look, look. 
  One more surprise, OK? 
  - OK. 
  - Here. 
  It doesn't tell time or anything, OK, but it's a family heirloom. 
  My dad gave it to me, his dad gave it to him, and someday I'll give that to our child. 
  Jordan, you didn't have to do all this. 
  Sure, I did, OK? 
  We're We're in this together, Simone. 
  Yeah. 
  Yeah. 
  OK. 
  [HIP HOP MUSIC PLAYING] 
  PREACH: Look, I want these everywhere, man. 
  Don't come back until they're gone. 
  You got it, Preach. 
  COOP: You just ain't gonna give up, are you? 
  Just doing what you asked me to do. 
  Spencer. 
  What's up? 
  Hey, these are dope, Coop. 
  So what are we doing, Man? 
  Am I wasting my time again? 
  Yeah, we doing it, Man. 
  Let's get my name out there. 
  See, that's what I'm talking about, Man. 
  Now, look, all we got to do is just fill this place up. 
  All, right so anything you need me to do? 
  Make sure Patience is at the show. 
  For what? 
  We did one song together. 
  Patience adds something special. 
  Whoa, this is not a band. 
  I'm a solo act. 
  Man, whatever. 
  PREACH: Hey, yo. 
  Right? 
  Nobody's hearing me. 
  OK, so what's up with you? 
  Come on, man. 
  I don't want to get into this again. 
  First you "forgot" to tell Patience about Layla's pops, and now you're cutting her out your show? 
  Come on, Man, this ain't about Patience. 
  This about my music, and I need you to support that. 
  Do support you, Coop, but I'ma always tell you when you ain't acting right, and you ain't acting right. 
  Hey, I am making one of my famous BLTS for lunch. 
  You want one? 
  Uh, no. 
  Thanks. 
  Maybe we can go out and grab a bite then. 
  Um, I'm actually on my way to the office. 
  - Well, it's Sunday. 
  - Busy week. 
  I'm beginning to think you're trying to avoid me after we had our little Mistake? 
  Wait, is it a mistake to sleep with your own husband? 
  Sorry. 
  A moment of weakness? 
  Oh. 
  Well, I thought it was a A step forward. 
  Um, I really need to get to the office, Billy. 
  I've got to. 
  Yeah, go ahead. 
  Don't let me, uh, keep you from it. 
  - Oh, nice shot. 
  - Thanks. 
  You know, I'm just saying, if Spencer hadn't transferred to Beverly, taking my position and all my stats, I'd have definitely made that top 300 list. 
  So what did your dad say? 
  I haven't seen him yet. 
  Things are good between us now, but whenever football comes up, I always feel like he's disappointed in me. 
  So maybe talk to your mom instead. 
  Wait. 
  Where did that come from? 
  She asked to meet me for coffee. 
  - What? 
  - She wants you in her life and thought maybe I could help. 
  She waited too long, Olivia. 
  She could have reached out months ago. 
  Yeah, but what if she couldn't? 
  - What do you mean? 
  - I don't know. 
  She said she'd never willingly walk away from her son. 
  OK, but she did, so Which makes me wonder if someone made her stay away. 
  I don't know. 
  She said something about this being between her and your dad. 
  What, my dad? 
  No. 
  He would never do something like that, so People do messed-up things when they're hurting. 
  SIMONE: Hey. 
  Your mom let me in. 
  Hey, I think we officially have every children's book ever made. 
  Did you know there are over, like, 40 Dr. 
  Seuss books? 
  It's crazy. 
  [SIGHS] 
  What? 
  W-what's up? 
  You OK? 
  You You don't like Dr. 
  Seuss? 
  Jordan I can't accept this. 
  - You can't accept what? 
  - Any of it. 
  The room, the crib, the watch. 
  All that you're doing for me, I Whoa, whoa, I'm not just doing this for you, OK? 
  I'm doing this for us, for our baby. 
  That's the thing, Jordan. 
  It's not yours. 
  Wow. 
  What are you What are you talking about? 
  When I first found out that I was pregnant, I was Just feeling really alone, and And scared, and then I just I saw your family, and they were just so - What, we were so rich, is that it? 
  - No, no, Jordan. 
  It was never about the money. 
  I saw how much you loved your family, and I just I wanted somebody to love my kid like that. 
  Who's the father, Simone? 
  Someone I don't want in my baby's life. 
  I can't believe you made me think I was gonna be a dad. 
  I know, and I feel terrible. 
  Jordan, I just don't want you to hate Look, look, Simone, please, I need you to go. 
  Was it just me, or was Mr. 
  Vega singling me out in class today? 
  He called on me, like, 6 times. 
  I mean, you did miss half the semester. 
  He's probably just making up the time. 
  Solid point. 
  Do you want something to drink? 
  Nah, I'm good. 
  Hey, can I ask you about something? 
  It's about your advice. 
  I've been following it, you know, filling the void, keeping myself distracted, but it doesn't seem to be working. 
  And I got all this great stuff happening. 
  I mean, I'm the 57th-ranked player in the country. 
  But it's not making me feel better. 
  It's only been a couple weeks. 
  I didn't say it'd be easy. 
  Just try to keep your mind busy. 
  OK. 
  Do you mind if I hang here for a while? 
  Everybody else keeps trying to make me feel better, and you're the only one who actually does. 
  [CHUCKLES] 
  Actually, I could use your help. 
  What is all this? 
  Um Research, I guess. 
  Is it about your mom? 
  Yeah. 
  My dad told me she was suffering from depression when she died. 
  Not long before the accident, she wrote this song about giving up and ending all the pain. 
  All right, so what are you saying? 
  Well, look at this article about the accident. 
  Here, read the highlighted part. 
  "Keating's car was traveling approximately 61 miles per hour when it Hit the wall. 
  " "According to police, there were no tire marks before impact. 
  " - She didn't brake. 
  - Layla What if it wasn't an accident? 
  What if my mom K-killed herself? 
  And what if she fell asleep at the wheel? 
  There's no way to know. 
  The only person who does is gone. 
  Yeah, well, I have to know the answer, OK? 
  I have to know, and I'm gonna find out. 
  What's this? 
  Have some respect, OK? 
  It's a family heirloom. 
  Dad gave it to me. 
  - Should I be offended? 
  - No, just keep it. 
  It's yours now. 
  The only reason dad gave it to me is because he thought I was having a kid, but Breaking news I'm not. 
  Simone lied to me. 
  To all of us, actually. 
  She made everything up. 
  Wait. 
  Simone isn't pregnant? 
  She didn't make everything up; she is pregnant, but I'm not the father. 
  She only said I was because she knew I'd step up. 
  - Um, is she OK? 
  - She OK? 
  Really? 
  I'm the victim here, Liv. 
  You're not a victim, Jordan, OK? 
  She did something stupid out of fear, but she's still pregnant and alone. 
  Whose side are you even on? 
  There's only one side. 
  The baby's side, OK? 
  And maybe when you're not so upset, you'll realize that. 
  MAN: Everyone knows we have the best facilities in the country, but let's talk about game day. 
  We're on national TV every week. 
  [VOICE FADING] 
  Expect to compete in championships every year, and we send our best players to the NFL. 
  We believe you could be one of the very best to ever play, Son. 
  GRACE: Are you offering Spencer a scholarship? 
  COACH: Mrs. 
  James, Spencer had an offer before I walked through that door. 
  [CLEAR VOICE] 
  I thought you'd be happier, son. 
  I am. 
  Sorry. 
  Uh Do I got to answer now? 
  Of course not. 
  We'd love to bring you in for an official visit. 
  - [KNOCK ON DOOR] 
  - You both should come with him. 
  Got it. 
  This offer isn't going away, Spencer. 
  You have a spot on our team. 
  - [DOOR OPENS] 
  - Take as much time as you need. 
  DARNELL: Hey, uh, sorry to interrupt. 
  I just came by to pick up Spencer. 
  Coop's thing. 
  Oh. 
  Right. 
  I'm sorry. 
  I got to go, but thank you for coming, Coach. 
  - Thanks for having me, Spencer. 
  - My pleasure. 
  - GRACE: Thank you. 
  - SPENCER: Oh, you know Darnell Hayes, right? 
  COACH: Of course. 
  Nevada, transferred to South Crenshaw. 
  I called over there today. 
  I haven't heard back yet. 
  Oh, yeah, that's probably 'cause I'm transferring again. 
  - SPENCER: What? 
  - COACH: Where to? 
  My mom's stationed in Germany, so I'm gonna live with her. 
  - When are you leaving? 
  - A few days, but But I don't even know if they have a football team there, so COACH: If your plans change, I'd love to talk to you about your future. 
  I think the two of you in our offense at UCLA would be unstoppable. 
  [DISTANT HIP HOP MUSIC PLAYING] 
  PATIENCE: Hey. 
  This is crazy. 
  You nervous? 
  Hell yeah, I'm nervous. 
  I'm the one who should be nervous. 
  I haven't even performed my song at a studio yet, but it's OK. 
  I'ma be good. 
  I was actually gonna go with the original version tonight. 
  Oh, I thought you loved the remix. 
  No, I do, but, I mean, tonight is about getting my name out there, solo. 
  I don't know. 
  Um I am kind of, like, wondering something now. 
  Look, I know about J. P. 
  And how he told you that he liked my voice. 
  I don't know. 
  I just assumed that you forgot to tell me, but now I'm kinda feeling like you just didn't want me working with him. 
  I mean, singing is just a hobby for you. 
  It's not your dream. 
  This is my dream. 
  OK, so now I'm trying to steal your dream? 
  No. 
  All I've ever done was try to support you and your dreams. 
  What are you talking about? 
  OK, OK, OK, so why are you making this about you? 
  OK. 
  Right. 
  You know what? 
  Why don't you go ahead and make all of your dreams come true? 
  - What? 
  - No, no, no. 
  It's OK, I won't stand in your way. 
  [OVERLAPPING CHATTER] 
  Got We movin' on Hey, yo, did you know there was a line outside? 
  Man, there better be. 
  Look, it's all for the show. 
  Pay a few people to stand in line, everybody else wants in. 
  Yo, so that's how you filled this place up? 
  Bro, you might just be a genius! 
  Man, you came through. 
  Thank you. 
  Hey, don't thank me yet. 
  Your show's gonna get people talking for sure, but what they say is up to you. 
  All right, cool. 
  Ain't no pressure. 
  HAROLD: Should we order? 
  Actually, we're not ready. 
  Do they at least have breadsticks here? 
  OLIVIA: No. 
  - What is he doing here? 
  - What is she doing here, Asher? 
  Oh, well, this is so not gonna be awkward. 
  Surprise. 
  We're gonna have a civil dinner, then both of you are gonna answer some tough questions. 
  [EXHALES] 
  Now sit. 
  [HIP HOP MUSIC PLAYING] 
 
 
 
  So what, you leaving Crenshaw? 
  I mean, with Corey gone, it doesn't make sense for me to stay. 
  He always told me this was gonna be the best time of my life. 
  Colleges coming after me. 
  Yo, that coach is pretty interested in you, Dawg. 
  A lot of schools will be, all right? 
  I made my decision, Bro. 
  Doesn't matter now. 
  I'll be right back, Bro. 
  COOP: Yo, Spence, what's up, man? 
  - What's good? 
  - Glad you made it. 
  What is with that line outside? 
  Man, Preach set that up. 
  It's fake, the whole thing. 
  To what, bring in a crowd? 
  That's Cr Genius, right? 
  Yeah. 
  Ha ha! 
  SPENCER: Patience OK? 
  Nope. 
  You was right. 
  She is not talking to me. 
  All right. 
  So go fix it. 
  What, you think I should ask her to perform with me tonight? 
  Only if you want her to. 
  Do you? 
  Make that line Better make that Hey. 
  You coming to this Ring Ceremony or what? 
  Um, I've been waiting for the right time to give you these, but I don't know if there's ever gonna be a right time. 
  What's this? 
  They are legal separation papers. 
  Are you serious? 
  Yes. 
  Whoa. 
  Hold on. 
  Hold up. 
  Wait. 
  Wait. 
  Wait. 
  Wait. 
  Where is this coming from? 
  Why so all of a sudden? 
  It's not all of a sudden, Billy. 
  Look, if we're gonna get a divorce, then we have to be legally separated for a year first. 
  A divorce. 
  Is that what you want? 
  What I want is to move forward, and the best way to do that is separated. 
  I don't want that. 
  I'm sorry. 
  L Laura. 
  Laura. 
  [CROWD CHEERING]

  Yo, what's she doing? 
  Guess we about to find out. 
  Um, I'm a bad girlfriend, and I did some things I shouldn't, and I said a lot that I shouldn't. 
  I was a little jealous, too. 
  I guess I thought I was afraid of losing my dream to her, but I realized it wasn't my dream that I was afraid of losing. 
  That's my girlfriend back there. 
  Patience, you can wave if you want to. 
  She's talented, yo, and it's unmatched. 
  I ain't never seen nothing like it, and I guess I thought that if people knew how talented she was that I'd lose her. 
  And to just keep it 100 with y'all, she's the best thing that ever happened to me. 
  - Aw. 
  - Aw. 
  COOP: And this next song, it just wouldn't be the same without her because she truly makes me better in every way. 
  To be honest, Babe, I'm not willing to perform this song without you. 
  [DRUMMER PLAYING] 
  I know you ain't gonna leave me standing up here after all that, are you? 
  [EXCITED CHATTER] 
  What if I told you I was kind of different? 
  And me not loving you for who you are Now, it wasn't exactly my intention If I told you I was prolific Would you believe me Or find it in your heart to receive me? 
  If I told you I'm this way and I like girls Would you still look me in my face Or would you say some things to make me run away? 
  Would you tell me that I'm sinning? 
  This ain't god's work, baby, you ain't livin' Should I change my ways to try to make you listen? 
  If I turn suicidal, when I slit my wrists all on your holy Bible Would you turn your back or would you hold me tighter? 
  If I'm laying in the hearse, would you cry Because I never wore a skirt? 
  Or you be mad because I didn't tell you first? 
  You don't ask, so I won't say nothing You know it's not my style to never say nothing You don't ask, so I won't say nothing You know it's not my style to never say nothing Yeah, you know it's not my style It's not my style Yeah, you know it's not my style Not my style PATIENCE: I'm never changing who I am For anyone or anything You can stay or you can leave, but This is me, this is me I'm never changing who I am For anyone or anything You can stay or you can leave, but This is me, this is me [VOICE OF J.

  That's the first time I've heard you admit that. 
  You were right, Spencer. 
  And you've been trying to help me for months, and all I did was, like, push you away. 
  Yeah, but I'm still here. 
  I'm still here. 
  Want to tell me what happened? 
  I guess I was trying to make a point about my mom's accident, and I was gonna brake. 
  - Yeah, and you did. 
  - Yeah, but there was There was, like, a moment where I hesitated. 
  [SIGHS] 
  For months, I've just been trying to do everything to feel something, anything and I'm just numb. 
  Maybe it's because you never really faced what happened with your mom. 
  And you not dealing with that probably snowballed into you not dealing with a lot of things. 
  I'm gonna need help to get through this, and you're right. 
  It's the first time I'm admitting that.

  I want the truth. 
  It's that simple. 
  Mom, I really needed you, and you abandoned me. 
  I want to know why. 
  Yeah. 
  You hurt both of us when you left. 
  Oh, you shut up, Harold. 
  Don't you play the victim here. 
  There's a big difference between leaving you and abandoning my son. 
  I left you willingly. 
  So you didn't leave me willingly? 
  OLIVIA: Wait. 
  What exactly does that mean, Gwen? 
  Your father made me promise to stay away from you. 
  Is that true? 
  GWEN: And if I broke that promise, he would tell everybody Our friends but, most importantly, you That more than 20 years ago, I was an escort. 
  I'm just [EXHALES] 
  Wait. 
  When did you find out? 
  GWEN: Sweetheart, that's how we met. 
  GWEN: Now, look, honey, I'm not ashamed of what I did. 
  I was young. 
  I needed to survive. 
  But I am ashamed that I let your father convince me to stay away from you for so long. 
  Keeping that secret just wasn't worth the cost, and for that, I am so sorry. 
  [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] 
  BILLY: It takes a lot of blood, sweat, and tears to win a championship, and a little bit of luck.

  Seuss books.

  [BOTH CHUCKLE] 
  ASHER: Why'd you bring me here? 
  OLIVIA: Because this place always makes me feel better. 
  Is it working yet? 
  I don't know who I'm more mad at My dad for blackmailing my mom or my mom for giving in. 
  Yeah, well, at least you know the truth. 
  I don't know what I'd do without you, Liv. 
  Seriously.

  Well, that's what friends are for, right? 
  Right. 
  We should get in. 
  Liv. 
  Come on. 
  It'll be fun. 
  Come on, Liv. 
  We're more than friends, Olivia. 
  We've already had this conversation. 
  I know. 
  I know. 
  But if I've learned anything this last week, it's that I don't want to be dishonest. 
  I'm sorry, but I don't want to be just friends. 
  Asher, your friendship is the best thing in my life right now. 
  Why risk that? 
  A chance of something even better. 
  But But what if? 
  What if What if I told you I'm in love with you? 
  What if I kissed you right now? 
  If you don't want me to kiss you, you'd better say something. 
  Try to remember Who you are It'll get better Just hold on I kind of made a big decision today. 
  I hope you'll understand. 
  I'm not gonna play football no more. 
  I love the game, but I realize now it was my way of connecting with you. 
  Now it just hurts too much to play. 
  So now it's time to figure out what's next for me in life. 
  But whatever it is, I'll try to make you proud.
