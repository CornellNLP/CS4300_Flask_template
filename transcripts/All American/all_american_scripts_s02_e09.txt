 Previously on "All American"  
  LAYLA: What if my mom killed herself? 
  I was gonna brake, but there was a moment where I hesitated. 
  I need help. 
  COREY: This gonna be our last weekend together as a family. 
  Dad! 
  I'm the 57th-ranked player in the country, but it's not making me feel better. 
  I'm not gonna play football no more. 
  It was my way of connecting with you. 
  Now it just hurts too much to play. 
  TYRONE: You thought you were smarter than me, huh? 
  I put my faith in people like Shawn and Preach, and you took them out. 
  - Just business. 
  - LAPD! 
  Drop the gun! 
  COOP: I'll see you in a minute. 
  What's good, Coop? 
  What's good, Ty? 
  [GUN COCKS.] Bounce up out of here, Coop. 
  Protecting snitches now? 
  This about me and you. 
  Coop ain't the one who shot me. 
  I'll leave your dog ass stretched out right here. 
  You could, but that probably ain't the best idea, though. 
  Because Coop will be dead before my body even cold. 
  How the hell did Tyrone get out? 
  Man, I have no idea. 
  I called Mrs. 
  Baker on the way over here, and neither does she. 
  She said she would make some calls. 
  All right. 
  Coop, I know you stressing, but you got to chill, all right? 
  At least sit down. 
  Bro, I had this man set up and arrested. 
  There's no way Tyrone gonna let this slide. 
  Nobody letting nothing happen to you, all right? 
  For how long? 
  I can't just keep living my life looking over my shoulder. 
  [KNOCK ON DOOR.] [KNOCK KNOCK.] Yo, did I miss something? 
  'Cause I'm pretty damn sure shooting somebody 4 times at pointblank range equals a half life sentence. 
  It is, but I ain't no snitch. 
  You refused to testify? 
  Then they dropped the charges against Tyrone. 
  Look, I'll handle Tyrone in the streets. 
  COOP: Oh, I risked my life for you and this neighborhood to have his ass put away. 
  Why not keep him locked up? 
  'Cause that ain't how I operate. 
  SPENCER: This ain't just about you, man. 
  I've been out on these streets too damn long to let some teenagers tell me how to handle business. 
  I just came here to tell you that you ain't got to worry about Tyrone. 
  COOP: Easy for you to say. 
  You ain't the one that had his ass put away. 
  We came to an understanding. 
  As long as you stay alive, so does he. 
  He breaks that deal, and I'm putting 4 bullets in him. 
  Where do I go when I feel like it's weighing on my shoulders Heavy as a Boulder? 
  Everybody always told me I was getting closer I just want some closure Flyin' with the eagles, ego checking I was stayin' ready Excuse me, sir. 
  [QUARTERBACK CALLING SIGNALS.] just to send a message I'm sentimental for the old times, but it's go time I appreciate you. 
  QUARTERBACK: Check, check, check, check I'm the canary in a coal mine I'm a wild cat with starry eyes I was stayin' up till it's dead of night Workin' to the bone I'm not really feeling this. 
  Can you take it back? 
  Sure. 
  This is motivation till I get it right Come on This is motivation till I get it right [WHISTLE BLOWS, ASHER CHEERS.] - Let's go, baby! 
  Hey. 
  - Whoo! 
  ALL: Happy birthday, dear grandpa Happy birthday to you [APPLAUSE.] Well, well, well. 
  Hold up. 
  Grace James is making an appearance in these Beverly Hills streets? 
  Ha ha! 
  What's up, ma? 
  You tell me. 
  I can barely get you on the phone lately, so I figured I'd stop by. 
  You got time to grab a bite and catch up? 
  Of course. 
  But can we get it to go? 
  I got to walk my neighbor's dog in an hour. 
  Since when did you become a dog walker? 
  The moment she told me it was $50 per dog. 
  Look, me quitting football was a game changer. 
  I got to figure out a way to pay for college now, so I got a few extra shifts here and some side hustles going. 
  It's gonna take more than that to pay for college, son. 
  But don't worry. 
  I'll figure it out. 
  I was kind of hoping I could figure out the college thing on my own. 
  You already got me and Dillon to take care of, not to mention Darnell just moved in. 
  Bare minimum, let me help you. 
  You sound like Dillon. 
  He just won a cash award for top mathlete. 
  He insisted that I keep it. 
  Hey, that's what's up! 
  A mathlete? 
  - Mm-hmm. 
  - Wow. 
  Van Ness Charter's changed a whole lot since I went there. 
  He won the award at big brother's camp. 
  I enrolled him last month. 
  But he already has a big brother. 
  Why not come to me? 
  Between school and work, you got a lot going on, Spencer. 
  You can't do everything. 
  This was more about missing Corey. 
  It has nothing to do with you, OK? 
  Hey, there they are. 
  Wow. 
  He seems chipper. 
  Like, more than "we just won a game chipper. 
  " - OLIVIA: Yeah, should we be concerned? 
  - 100%. 
  You two do know that I can hear you, right? 
  Get over here. 
  Come on. 
  Sit down. 
  Come on. 
  Wait. 
  Is this about mom? 
  Is she not visiting aunt Naomi back east? 
  - Nope. 
  She is. 
  - Wait. 
  So did you guys decide to call off the separation or something? 
  No. 
  We haven't. 
  Look, why don't you guys stop trying to guess and just let me have my turn? 
  Can I speak, please? 
  - Sorry. 
  - All right. 
  Now, if there's one thing that I learned from family therapy, it's that we need to create some new memories, so since I have you both to myself this weekend, I thought we'd start today. 
  How about a movie, dinner afterwards? 
  What do you say? 
  Um, yeah, sorry, dad. 
  I got to take a rain check. 
  I already made plans with Asher. 
  But next time for sure. 
  OK. 
  Have fun. 
  Asher? 
  Are they a thing? 
  Oh, yeah. 
  Pet names, PDA, heart emojis. 
  It's gross. 
  Huh. 
  OK. 
  Well, I guess that leaves you and me. 
  Right. 
  Ah, I'm, uh, sorry. 
  Sorry. 
  I'm actually helping JJ mentor young kids today at his church, so JJ goes to church? 
  Our JJ? 
  Yeah. 
  He's a youth leader. 
  Huh. 
  Those poor kids. 
  I mean, uh, God bless him. 
  Right. 
  Um, I got you on the next one, though. 
  - Yeah, man. 
  - All right? 
  Cool. 
  BUGGS: I'm telling y'all, you don't want to miss the grand reopening of Bella Noche Skating Rink this weekend. 
  Big Viper and Slim Roman are headlining along with local Crenshaw artists, who'll be opening up the show. 
  It's gonna be lit. 
  [MUSIC PLAYING. 
 ] Excuse me. 
  You got local artists performing at the Bella Noche's reopening? 
  - Yeah. 
  - Oh. 
  How you ain't got me In the equation? 
  And who are you? 
  I'm Coop. 
  Oh, ho ho! 
  You got Coop'd, right? 
  - Yeah. 
  - Oh. 
  I saw your last video dissing ol' boy. 
  I'm Buggs. 
  Now, you all got to have room for another artist. 
  I promise you, I'll have them folks jumping out they skates. 
  And I'll earn my spot, whatever it takes. 
  Look, I'm the head promoter of the event. 
  I got one more slot to fill, if you can pull your weight. 
  You bet. 
  What do I got to do? 
  I got 40 of these tickets left to sell. 
  If you can get them off, I'll squeeze you in that slot. 
  Come on, man. 
  That's easy. 
  If there's anything I can do, it's sell some $15 tickets. 
  - $100. 
  - $100? 
  Damn. 
  What they come with, a chauffeur service? 
  It includes admission, skates, and an intimate concert with big viper. 
  Slim Roman, and possibly you. 
  [SCOFFS.] You telling me you ain't worth $100? 
  Coop? 
  Uh, um, my bad. 
  Nah, I'm I'm in. 
  I'm in. 
  My cell's on the back of that flyer. 
  I need the money in 24 hours, or it's a wrap. 
  All right. 
  Cool. 
  Making new friends, Coop? 
  None of your business. 
  One time for the mathlete champ. 
  Congratulations, D. 
  Thanks. 
  You been getting my texts, man? 
  I've been blowing you up. 
  I figured I'd do what you been doing to me lately Take 2 hours to hit you back. 
  I'm sorry, man. 
  I've been working like crazy trying to stack money for college. 
  I didn't have a chance to check my phone. 
  Hey, look, but I'm here now, all right? 
  So let's celebrate. 
  You want to hit up your favorite arcade? 
  Not with you. 
  GRACE: OK, that's enough. 
  Take those headphones off, please, now. 
  GRACE: I'm not a fan of this little attitude of yours. 
  Do you have something you want to tell us? 
  No. 
  SPENCER: Look, you know you can always talk to us, right? 
  And it can be about anything. 
  Jaystonians, Darnell moving in, dad being gone. 
  No matter what, me and moms is here for you. 
  You mean moms is here for me, right? 
  Because you're never here anymore. 
  But it's cool. 
  I got a mentor now. 
  I don't need you. 
  Feel free to stay in Beverly Hills. 
  LAYLA: That's the thing about perfection. 
  Everyone has their own idea of it. 
  My classmates wanted the perfect Stu-Co president. 
  The colleges want the perfect student. 
  And I thought I had to be the perfect daughter, the perfect girlfriend Why the need to be perfect? 
  Everyone thought I was, so I just convinced myself it was true. 
  That's the worst part about perfection, is disappointing yourself 'cause you're the one person you can't escape. 
  And when I realized I wasn't perfect, I just didn't feel motivated to do anything anymore. 
  Fear of letting people down? 
  Fear of not being enough. 
  OK. 
  What else? 
  What do you mean, what else? 
  Look, that's the beauty of peer group. 
  There's no doctors. 
  It's just us. 
  Share something you've never shared before. 
  It'll help with whatever's weighing you down. 
  I, um, I don't think the people in my life love me enough to stay. 
  My mom died, and was it an accident? 
  Or did she give up on herself or me? 
  Was I not worth living for? 
  I don't know. 
  And then my dad left. 
  And when our house was broken into, a house he left me to live in alone, he still didn't come back. 
  I mean, you know, he's here now, and he's trying. 
  I just feel like it's more out of guilt than out of love. 
  Thanks for trusting us with something so personal, Layla. 
  Major growth moment. 
  [ALL SNAPPING FINGERS.] SPENCER: No, for real, the way Dillon snapped at me reminded me of myself when Corey left. 
  I mean, maybe he's right. 
  Maybe I don't know how to be a good brother to him no more, not to mention help him through this crisis. 
  Hey, when was the last time Dillon had a whupping? 
  [BOTH CHUCKLE.] Listen, man, have you been a little busy lately? 
  Maybe. 
  But can't nobody deny your love for little man. 
  And the way I see it, he'll come around eventually. 
  He's still a kid. 
  He's just trying to navigate his way through the changes that happen in his life. 
  Speaking of changes What? 
  Man, you better not tell me you messed things up with Patience again. 
  Man, hell, no. 
  I got an opportunity to perform at Bella Noche. 
  - What?! 
  - Yeah. 
  You should've led with that, fool. 
  But I got to sell 40 tickets. 
  All right. 
  That's nothing. 
  - They $100 each. 
  - Damn. 
  Heh! 
  OK. 
  I mean, look, that's steep, but I think we can make it happen. 
  What's the part you're not telling me? 
  I don't know, man. 
  It's like, ever since he got out, Tyrone has been randomly popping up everywhere I'm at. 
  Like today at the Slauson Cafe. 
  It's got me feeling like I should lay low and maybe even give this dude back his tickets. 
  - Why? 
  What did Ty do? 
  - Nothing yet. 
  It just feels like, "I know what you did last summer" type vibe. 
  And I don't like that. 
  Look, Tyrone made a deal with Preach, right? 
  He ain't trying to die. 
  He's just trying to intimidate you. 
  You good, Coop. 
  And this gig is a dream opportunity. 
  You need to focus on moving forward with your life. 
  Well, I don't want to bore you with all the updates on everyone's lives on the outside. 
  No, Liv, I want to hear, I promise. 
  Um, how's How's Spencer? 
  Uh, I'm a little concerned. 
  Uh-oh. 
  Detective Liv on the loose. 
  You gonna shave your head and pretend to be him, too? 
  [CHUCKLES SOFTLY.] I'm kidding. 
  I No. 
  Spencer's just been working overtime like crazy. 
  I'm worried he's burying his feelings about quitting football. 
  Well, you know, maybe work is his way of finding himself. 
  Yeah, I can see that. 
  But, anyway, um, yeah, everything else is good. 
  Everyone's just really missing you on the outside. 
  Could you maybe stop saying "the outside" like I'm in a prison? 
  Yeah. 
  [CHUCKLING.] Sorry. 
  I missed you. 
  I missed you, too. 
  You seem really amazing. 
  When are you coming home? 
  Um, we'll see. 
  Layla, I thought you said they cleared you for off-campus visits, but this is the second time you had me come here instead. 
  Is everything OK? 
  Yeah. 
  Totally. 
  Um, it's just easier. 
  Uh, anyway, I got to get going, but I'll see you soon? 
  Yeah. 
  Thanks for coming. 
  OLIVIA: Hey, I just got your text. 
  Coop's having a concert tomorrow night? 
  Yeah, if we can help sell our share of the tickets in time. 
  Figure we can go door to door in my neighborhood, split the tickets between me, you two, and Dillon. 
  Yeah. 
  Yeah. 
  I'm game. 
  I mean, I'll already be that way doing community work with Kia for Sola Muse. 
  And Asher's meeting me afterwards. 
  So maybe they can tag along as well? 
  Yeah, bet. 
  I figure the more people we have, the faster we can sell those tickets. 
  BILLY: Tickets to what? 
  Coop's performing at Bella Noche Skating Rink tomorrow night. 
  - They reopening Bella Noche? 
  - Mm-hmm. 
  BILLY: Yo, that used to be my spot back in the day. 
  I had these teal blue roller skates, hammer pants, gumby haircut. 
  You couldn't tell me nothing. 
  Mm. 
  Then skee-lo's "I wish" would come on. 
  My skate moves were second to none, baby. 
  Ohh, ha, uh. 
  Cross it over. 
  Cross it over. 
  You had whose pants? 
  And what exactly is a gumby? 
  BILLY: You know what? 
  We should go roller-skating tomorrow. 
  My skates are at my pop's house. 
  I'll swing by, pick them up. 
  Four tickets, please, Spencer. 
  Shoot. 
  If you couldn't go to Bella Noche, where else could you go? 
  Ha ha! 
  Yo, two left. 
  Thank you. 
  All right. 
  I'll see you all tonight. 
  What the hell you doing? 
  What does it look like I'm doing? 
  I'm selling tickets. 
  For what? 
  For a concert tonight at Bella Noche. 
  One of the promotes is giving me a slot to perform as an opening act for Big Viper and Slim Roman - if I can sell - Who? 
  You're not hearing what I'm saying? 
  - What promoter? 
  - His name is Buggs. 
  How do you know him? 
  He legit? 
  Look who want to protect me now. 
  You can't be getting caught up with folks that you don't know from a can of paint. 
  Listen, what I'm gonna do is go on about my business, selling these tickets, and you go on about yours, letting known killers roam the street. 
  So how was your visit with Layla? 
  Good. 
  Fine. 
  That bad, huh? 
  She flip out when she found out about you and Asher or what? 
  I kind of didn't tell her. 
  She'd doing great but still seems hesitant about her recovery, and I don't want to say anything that might make things worse. 
  Well, isn't transparency part of recovery? 
  I mean, you should just be honest with her and tell her the truth, Liv. 
  Do I really have to go? 
  Yeah, man. 
  Coop is depending on us. 
  And it'll give me and you a chance to hang out. 
  You can finally tell me what's really bothering you. 
  Ain't nothing bothering me. 
  I used to say the same thing, Dillon. 
  Wow. 
  I love how you quit football and everybody's fine with it. 
  But as soon as I speak something from my opinion about anything, I'm a problem. 
  [KNOCK ON DOOR.] [OLIVIA CLEARS THROAT.] - Hey, babe. 
  - Hey. 
  All right. 
  The squad's all here. 
  We appreciate you, man. 
  ASHER: Yeah, no problem. 
  So what's the plan? 
  KIA: Divide and conquer. 
  Nope. 
  Nope. 
  Mm-mm. 
  Nope. 
  Not playing the third wheel to the Asher-Liv reality show today. 
  Sorry. 
  SPENCER: Don't even listen to him, Ash, all right? 
  You can roll with me and Dillon. 
  So you and Olivia are a thing now, right? 
  Like for real, for real? 
  ASHER: Yeah. 
  You better treat her right because as soon as I turn 18, she'll be the first person I call. 
  You know you're gonna have a fight on your hands, though. 
  - OK. 
  All right - All right. 
  ASHER: If you're cool with that, man. 
  - Oh, yeah, I'm cool. 
  - Ha ha! 
  WOMAN: You were on fire in peer group today. 
  That's two days in a row. 
  I'm proud of you. 
  Well, if you had told me 3 weeks ago that I would be spilling my guts to a room of complete strangers, I would've told you you were lying. 
  Honestly, you surprised me, too. 
  I didn't know if you'd open up. 
  What made you push? 
  I see a lot of myself in you. 
  I just went with my gut. 
  I felt like there was more there. 
  I have a confession. 
  My treatment program's done. 
  I'm leaving tomorrow. 
  Um, I'm happy for you. 
  I didn't say anything sooner because I didn't want to upset you and stall your progress. 
  It just won't be the same without you. 
  Layla, you're doing awesome. 
  [CHUCKLES.] Are you ready to go back out into the real world? 
  Aren't you nervous? 
  Of course. 
  When you've been here for so long, it feels weird going back. 
  We have to eventually, right? 
  COOP: All right, Dillon. 
  Let's go. 
  We got one more ticket to sell, and ain't nobody gonna say no to a kid with a head that big and feet that long. 
  Ha ha! 
  ASHER: You better get her. 
  Hey, man, is it just me, or are things a little tense between you and Dillon? 
  Nah, it ain't just you, man. 
  Ever since I quit football and been working overtime, I ain't been around as much. 
  Dillon's kind of struggling with that. 
  You miss it? 
  Football? 
  Pssh. 
  Man, I can't even front. 
  There's parts of it I do miss. 
  Hanging in the locker room with you all, road trips on the bus. 
  Anyway, this your time now, bro. 
  You the captain now, and you got to lead that team back to another 'ship. 
  I appreciate the love, man. 
  Hey, if you ever decide to come back, your Jersey with the captain's patch will be waiting for you. 
  [DILLON GRUNTS.] Hey, aren't you the same dude that didn't even want Spencer at Beverly? 
  It's called growth, little homie. 
  COOP: All right. 
  Last tickets sold. 
  It's official. 
  Your girl's performing tonight. 
  There you go. 
  Congrats. 
  Hey, we got to celebrate. 
  Let's hit Smitty's. 
  I'm buying. 
  Bro, Smitty's been closed a long time ago. 
  They changed it to some spot called Bunch-o Fro-yo. 
  Gentrification's hitting us like that now? 
  You'd know if you'd been here. 
  COOP: All right. 
  Look, I got to get going, turn this money in. 
  So I'll catch up with you all later. 
  All right. 
  It feels so easy just for me to ASHER: Hey, what was this place called? 
  SPENCER: Smitty's. 
  But now it's Bunch-o Fro-yo. 
  OLIVIA: No, we're doing the big cookie Big cookie and a pint KIA: Ice cream poured on top - ASHER: Hey. 
  - JORDAN: What's up? 
  Hey, get as much as you want, Dillon. 
  OLIVIA: Yes. 
  OK. 
  OK, we're getting one of these. 
  And then SPENCER: Hey, uh, I'm paying for everybody. 
  - OLIVIA: What? 
  - JORDAN: Thanks, Spence. 
  So you're big-time now? 
  What? 
  Nah. 
  Just taking care of everybody for looking out today. 
  So the extra money for college is what, a lie? 
  That's enough, all right? 
  Stop it. 
  I've been giving you a pass all day, but I'm done, you hear me? 
  You not the only person who lost somebody, Dillon. 
  Spence, chill. 
  I'm sorry, D. 
  I didn't mean to talk to you like that. 
  Forget this. 
  Dillon, listen, man. 
  OLIVIA: It's OK. 
  We'll We'll get another one. 
  It's all good. 
  Go get another one. 
  Go on. 
  - OLIVIA: Napkins? 
  - ASHER: Come on, man. 
  I got you. 
  I got you. 
  Can I get a napkin, please? 
  OWNER: You know what? 
  Just leave it. 
  It's fine. 
  No, it's all good. 
  My apologies. 
  I got this. 
  Actually, I think it's time for all of you to leave. 
  [CHUCKLES WEAKLY.] OLIVIA: What? 
  We just got here? 
  OWNER: Well, as the owner, I reserve the right to dismiss you from the premises. 
  So - Seriously? 
  - Yeah. 
  We're paying customers. 
  I told my brother I'm buying him fro-yo, I'ma buy him fro-yo. 
  Just please go, all right? 
  I don't want to have any problems with you people. 
  Us people? 
  You mean the black people in the neighborhood you just moved into? 
  [SIGHS.] You know what? 
  Let's bounce. 
  This is the last time you're gonna ever get our money. 
  Take it. 
  Let's roll. 
  - ASHER: You OK? 
  Olivia: - Yeah, I'm fine. 
  I just can't believe she kicked us out. 
  Believe it. 
  Chicks like her are becoming the new normal. 
  JORDAN: Um, so how's the fro-yo, kid? 
  I just want to go home. 
  OK. 
  Let's go. 
  Come on. 
  [VEHICLE APPROACHES, POLICE RADIO TRANSMISSIONS.] SPENCER: Come on. 
  We need to see some I. 
  D. 
  May I ask why? 
  OFFICER: According to the owner of Bunch-o's, a person fitting your description was loitering and causing disorderly conduct. 
  Loitering? 
  KIA: You don't have to answer that question, Spence. 
  I've already committed their names and badge numbers to memory. 
  Officers Bright and Whitner. 
  WHITNER: A lot of gangs congregate in this area. 
  Are you in one? 
  SPENCER: Go stand next to Jordan, Dillon. 
  Go on. 
  Look, the owner straight profiled us, OK? 
  We didn't do nothing wrong. 
  But you did get into a fight in the store. 
  An argument with my little brother. 
  Doesn't mean I'm in a gang. 
  It doesn't mean you aren't. 
  - Can we go now? 
  - Hey, watch your tone. 
  This is unnecessary, Officer. 
  Step aside, son. 
  This doesn't concern you. 
  Now, I'm gonna ask you one more time. 
  Where's your I. D. ? 
  SPENCER: Wait. 
  Wait. 
  Wait. 
  No, no, no! 
  No! 
  Don't run, you hear me? 
  You don't ever run. 
  Come on. 
  Come on. 
  Let's go. 
  BRIGHT: No one's leaving till you finish answering our questions. 
  Your partner almost pulled a gun out on us! 
  We either finish this here, or we take this to the police station. 
  Look, man, can you please let my friends take my little brother home? 
  He don't need to be seeing all this. 
  Everybody is staying put. 
  Why haven't you read us our rights? 
  WHITNER: 'cause you're not in custody. 
  Exactly, which should make us free to go. 
  Are Spencer and Kia going to jail? 
  ASHER: No, no, buddy. 
  They're just asking them some questions. 
  JORDAN: This is absolutely crazy. 
  OLIVIA: Those are my friends on the curb. 
  You could stop this, you know? 
  What's going on here? 
  - Reggie Bright. 
  - Billy Baker. 
  You know him, Coach? 
  Yeah. 
  Yeah. 
  We went to South Crenshaw together. 
  You know these kids? 
  The kids that you're racially profiling? 
  Hell, yeah, I know 'em. 
  Now, what's going on? 
  Nobody's being racially profiled. 
  We're just answering a call. 
  Yeah, I know. 
  My daughter texted me. 
  Look, you know these kids are good. 
  They didn't do nothing wrong. 
  BRIGHT: We're just being extra cautious. 
  Kids have changed around here since you escaped to Beverly Hills. 
  Since I escaped? 
  OK, look here. 
  You can either release these kids immediately, or my wife and I will successfully sue your entire department, and then we'll make sure both your asses are stuck behind a desk for the rest of your natural born lives. 
  Do you feel me? 
  Yeah. 
  That's how we do it Beverly Hills style, Reggie. 
  [GLASS BREAKS.] [FOOTSTEPS.] WOMAN: Carrie, put it down. 
 
 
 
  I need some help down here! 
  [RAPID FOOTSTEPS.] Code blue. 
  Code blue. 
  Put it down. 
  WOMAN: Don't cut yourself. 
  Carrie? 
  [CARRIE SOBBING.] You don't have to do this.

  - I can't. 
  I'm sorry. 
  - Come on. 
  Come on. 
  - I can't. 
  Layla, I'm so sorry. 
  [CARRIE SOBBING.] How's Dillon? 
  He's still a little bit shaken up, but he'll be fine. 
  A good, nice rest should do the trick. 
  I'm sorry, ma. 
  I was just trying to make Dillon feel better. 
  Instead, I made everything worse. 
  You're not the one that needs to be sorry. 
  Wait till I get my hands on that fro-yo woman. 
  - Officer Bright? 
  - I know. 
  You kidding me? 
  Mm-hmm. 
  I never liked his ass in high school. 
  He was such a Ugh.

  - No, no, no, no.

  No, no. 
  Don't give that woman or those cops that power. 
  Your mom is right.

  GRACE: Reclaim your life.

  OLIVIA: Wait.

  Yup. 
  When we got to the front door, they wouldn't let us in. 
  It was adult night, 21 and over. 
  But we really wanted to stay. 
  So I sweet-talked the bouncer into letting us in.

  Oh, man. 
  The party just got started. 
  Look, dad, I know what you're doing, OK? 
  And I appreciate it. 
  I do. 
  But you can't force memories. 
  Hey, this is radio station wskee Are you sure about that? 
  [IMITATES ROBOTIC VOICE.] Are you sure about [IMITATES MECHANICAL BUZZ.] That? 
  Oh, my God. 
  What do I have to do to make you stop?

  Ha ha! 
  Go. 
  [BILLY LAUGHING.] 'Cause when it comes to playing basketball JORDAN: All right. 
  Here we go. 
  So I just lean up on the wall What you got? 
  with the rest of the girls who came to watch their man ball Dag, y'all, I never understood black Why the jocks get the fly girls You know, Kia was pretty bad-ass with those cops today. 
  Hey, you were pretty bad-ass, too. 
  I didn't do that much. 
  You called the owner out on her B. 
  S. 
  You spoke up. 
  Yeah, 'cause she tried to blow up our lives the same way Barbecue Becky did. 
  I guess I can add fro-yoing while black to the list of things I can't do. 
  You know, that fro-yo lady needs her own nickname. 
  Fro-yo Fannie? 
  [ASHER CHUCKLES.] OK, that's pretty good. 
  Um Crenshaw Cathy. 
  Ooh. 
  Yes. 
  Yes, you win. 
  It's crazy. 
  You hear about the Barbecue Beckys and the Doorman Daves of the world, and you think you know how bad it is, but the truth is, until today, I had no idea. 
  I guess we got to get out of our Beverly Hills bubble more often. 
  Yeah, I guess so. 
  LAYLA: Where are you going now? 
  Laguna Niguel. 
  It's a more restrictive treatment center. 
  I wasn't trying to cut myself. 
  I was just Too scared to go home. 
  You knew if they caught you with alcohol, they would make you stay in rehab longer. 
  So you made sure that they caught you. 
  How did you know? 
  I'm someone who's suffered from self-harming. 
  We try to hide our injuries, not amplify them. 
  And you caused a big disturbance. 
  You know how you said you see yourself in me? 
  I see myself in you, too. 
  We got better in here. 
  We know how to make it work in here, but out in the real world, there's no guarantees. 
  And that petrifies me. 
  I know that's why you sabotaged yourself into staying in the comfort of rehab. 
  And it is why I have decided to check myself out tomorrow. 
  I need to take this step for both of us, to prove that we can make it in the real world. 
  Are you sure you're ready? 
  No. 
  But like my therapist says, you are never fully prepared for anything. 
  You just have to take a leap of faith and remember that healing is constant. 
  You know, one step at a time. 
  And whenever you're ready to make that step, just know you have a friend on the outside. 
  OK? 
  Everything good with Coop? 
  Yeah. 
  Yeah. 
  She said she'll explain later. 
  I'ma take her at her word. 
  Hey, thanks for having my back with the cops today, all right? 
  Come on, man. 
  Always. 
  OK. 
  How was Dillon afterwards? 
  I just wish I could spend more time with him, but between work and school, there's just not enough hours in the day. 
  So you remember how much I love "the great debaters," right? 
  Ha ha. 
  Oh, you made me watch that movie at least a thousand times. 
  OK. 
  It's one of the main reasons I joined the debate club. 
  - Yeah, yeah, yeah. 
  - Uncle flip is the other. 
  Flip? 
  For real? 
  The man is brilliant. 
  Before he served time, he taught me the art of debating. 
  And real talk, he's the best coach I've ever had. 
  Damn. 
  That time together really bonded me and him for life. 
  My point Memories matter, Spencer. 
  Find the time for Dillon regardless of what it takes. 
  You guys need each other, especially now with your dad gone. 
  [UNLOCKS GATE.] Hey, thanks again for tonight. 
  It's been a minute since we hung like this. 
  I guess I never realized the power of memories. 
  I know. 
  Crazy, right? 
  Yeah. 
  I miss this. 
  Nobody's home for a few hours. 
  [CHUCKLES.] What's up, Preach? 
  You was right. 
  I got played. 
  Buggs took all the money I raised selling tickets. 
  I mean, I got to get that money back. 
  You think you could just roll with me through there? 
  I just need a little backup. 
  But earlier when I tried to warn you about dude, I was the b*st*rd who let a murderer walk free, right? 
  This your problem. 
  You clean it up. 
  I got my own stuff to handle. 
  [LINE CONNECTING.] [CLEARS THROAT.] Hey. 
  Hey, uh, I was just checking in. 
  You good? 
  Always. 
  You? 
  Yeah. 
  So, listen, about last night. 
  Spencer, we got lost in the moment, and it just happened. 
  No big deal, right? 
  Right. 
  So we good? 
  Yeah. 
  We good. 
  For real, like we said yesterday. 
  There's power in memories. 
  Especially the good ones. 
  - Good morning, Spencer. 
  - Good morning. 
  Hey. 
  What's up, little man? 
  Nothing much. 
  What's up with you? 
  You ready to come to work with me today? 
  Sorry. 
  I can't. 
  Got to go to camp. 
  I know. 
  That's my new job. 
  [DILLON CHUCKLES.] Wait. 
  What? 
  I ditched working Sundays in exchange for volunteer work at your big brother camp. 
  But what about the money for college? 
  The only thing that matters right now is you. 
  And, look, I know it's hard with dad being gone. 
  And there's nothing I can do about the memories you won't get to make with him. 
  But there is something I can do about the memories you and I can make together as brothers. 
  So let me clarify this. 
  My big brother is about to become my big brother? 
  Yup. 
  Cool. 
  Hey. 
  You're up early. 
  Yeah. 
  I never quite slept. 
  I've been putting my new podcast together. 
  Podcast? 
  It's a school thing? 
  Uh, more of a life thing. 
  People like Crenshaw Cathy need to be exposed for the harm they cause. 
  And more than that, people around here need to understand the injustices that are going on and what they can do to help. 
  OK, Shaun King. 
  I'm calling my podcast "Liv the truth. 
  " I mean, whether it's police brutality or racial inequality or whatever, I'm putting it on blast. 
  Huh. 
  I'm tired of living in this Beverly Hills bubble while the rest of the world crumbles around us. 
  I love it. 
  - Yeah? 
  - Yeah. 
  BILLY: Not too many people could take something so traumatic and turn it into something positive. 
  I'm proud of you. 
  Thanks, dad. 
  Can't stop the rain Falls down anyway Feels like the clouds will never leave Wait. 
  I didn't know you guys were coming. 
  Well, we meant it when we said we love you. 
  [LAYLA CHUCKLES.] [SPENCER AND OLIVIA CHUCKLE.] Let me guess. 
  My dad sent you because he didn't want to tell me he's leaving town again. 
  Actually, he's pulling the car round right now. 
  Um, Layla, there actually is something I wanted to tell you, though. 
  You and Asher are dating? 
  Yeah, I'd have to be blind not to have seen that coming, Liv. 
  You two are good for each other. 
  Oh SPENCER: You all ready? 
  [LAUGHTER.] COOP: Yo, man, all those people paid to see me perform last night. 
  I gave you $4,000 for nothing. 
  No, they still got to skate. 
  Man. 
  Give me my money back, and we'll leave it at that. 
  Yo, if you don't get your ass on. 
  [LAUGHING.] Look, I want Coop's money back now. 
  I already turned it in. 
  Man, you better pull it out your ass or something. 
  - Or else what? 
  - Man, try me. 
  Am I supposed to be scared? 
  First, you running round with snitches. 
  Now you letting Tyrone roam free after he shot you? 
  Man, miss me with that. 
  Black Jack. 
  No trade back, homie. 
  COOP: Hey, yo, Preach! 
  Preach! 
  Chill. 
  He's good. 
  He's good. 
  Chill. 
  [KICKS LANDING.] Preach! 
  Got me all acting out of character. 
  Man. 
  Where the rest of it at? 
  I gave a cut to the organizers. 
  [KICKS BUGGS.] Preach, I ain't want you to do all that. 
  I just wanted to get the money back. 
  You can't just be beating up people 'cause you mad at Tyrone. 
  Look, this ain't about Tyrone. 
  Look, I'm mad at you. 
  Man, you weak as hell out here. 
  And you making me weak, too. 
  That's why you got played, and that's why Tyrone and the rest of these blockhead busters think they can come at me sideways. 
  I'm tired of saving your raggedy ass time and time again. 
  Look, I'm keeping all this. 
  Consider this your final debt to me. 
  I'm done. 
  For real this time.
