 Previously on "All American" Spencer James? 
  Billy Baker, Varsity Coach Beverly high. 
  I'll cut to the chase, Spencer. 
  I need you to come play for me. 
  - But you can't recruit. 
  - I can get around that. 
  ANNOUNCER: James shoots the gap and blocks it! 
  Touchdown Beverly! 
  Your new State Champions the Beverly High Eagles! 
  MAN: LAPD! 
  Drop the gun! 
  Drop it! 
  COOP: It's all over now. 
  All I had to do was set the bait. 
  Is everything OK? 
  I had an affair with Grace James. 
  JORDAN: Was it worth it? 
  You sacrificed your entire family, buy, hey, you finally got that elusive win you so desperately wanted, right, Dad? 
  SPENCER: I don't have a father, not anymore. 
  GRACE: Corey left a few years back. 
  He went to coach College Ball in Nevada. 
  We haven't seen him since. 
  COREY: I want you to move back home, come play for me. 
  So you gonna be the Head Coach of South Crenshaw? 
  Did you really come back for his first game like you promised? 
  - Yeah. 
  - Then why wouldn't you tell me that you were there? 
  Then I would have had to finally ask if Dillon was my son or Billy's. 
  NIPSEY HUSSLE: Oh, Baby, it's been so long Ohh, oh, oh Ooh Oh, Baby, it's been so long Ohh, oh, oh Ooh Mogul, and they know that Logo on my floor mat Courtside, Chamberlain throwback match my Rolex Find me out in different places And "The Spook By The Door" this is the infiltration Double back dressed in blue laces Ooh Oh, Baby, it's been so long COOP: Things will never be the same around here. 
  SPENCER: 33 years young. 
  It don't make no damn sense. 
  It never does. 
  That new? 
  Naw. 
  It was a gift from Shawn. 
  Pendant means destiny. 
  Supposed to remind me that I'm the master of my own fate. 
  Oh, Baby, it's been so long Ohh, oh, oh So what's next for you? 
  You done with that gang stuff, right? 
  I mean, they still my boys. 
  I ain't just gonna wash my hands of them. 
  I don't really know what's next, but we should go, man. 
  Don't you got some end of winter beach break, whatever you got to do? 
  It's a party celebrating the Eagles' big win, but real talk partying with them don't feel right, not with my community hurting this bad. 
  Man, Tuesday, you're gonna have your chance to honor Nipsey and Crenshaw. 
  Today, you got to celebrate that big win. 
  Yeah, you right, especially since that's my last championship win with them. 
  What? 
  Hold up. 
  So you mean to tell me you decided to play for your pops in the fall? 
  This my dad we're talking about, my family, coming home to Crenshaw. 
  Is there really a decision to make? 
  Bro, that is dope. 
  Like, I know your pops is happy. 
  - I ain't told him yet. 
  - What? 
  Look. 
  My moms and Coach Baker put a lot on the line to get me to Beverly. 
  I owe them a conversation first. 
  I feel you, man, but you got to talk to your people at Beverly Hills, too, because I guarantee you right now, Bro, they planning their future around somebody that's not even planning on being there next year. 
  That's not OK. 
  WOMAN: Everybody put your hands up Hey, hey, hey Put your hands up Hey, hey, hey, hey We run the world Hot damn, put your crown on Bop in my meeting with the champagne Bop in, gonna dance off Drifting my beach, no C-caine They made them go, aw [BOYS SHOUTING.] All eyes on me, we're escaping Hey, jump in the OK. 
  Um, that hookup is new. 
  OLIVIA: Today, it's Jasmine. 
  Two days ago, it was Reagan. 
  Last week Crystala. 
  Wow. 
  Go, Jordan. 
  It's like his way of dealing with our family drama is by creating his own gross version of "the bachelor. 
  " Liv, he's QB-1 on a championship-winning team. 
  He's just taking advantage of his new celeb status. 
  He's fine. 
  So you've been a hard person to reach over winter break. 
  Um, you were the one who disappeared to Lake Tahoe with your mom and Jordan. 
  Magically, phones still work up there. 
  - Oh. 
  OK. 
  - I mean, I left you messages. 
  I was worried about you. 
  I'm great. 
  Layla, you kind of had a breakdown after the game. 
  I mean, you tore up your house. 
  OK. 
  It was not a breakdown. 
  I was just mad at my dad for not taking the first break-in seriously, so I kind of just took it out on his crap and let him think there was another break-in. 
  That's it, and it worked because now he's back, and we're spending quality time together house hunting, and everything's perfect. 
  - JORDAN: Hey, Layla. 
  - LAYLA: Hey. 
  Where's Spencer? 
  I could use his quick feet right about now to shut JJ up. 
  He's on his way, but if you're down a man for 7 on 7, I can fill in. 
  JASMINE: OK. 
  JJ is seriously still running his mouth. 
  You playing, Jordan? 
  LAYLA: OK, QB-1. 
  Let's go. 
  I'm gonna show you what quick feet look like. 
  OK. 
  JORDAN: Hey, guys. 
  We don't have Spence, but even better, we got Layla. 
  [CHEERING.] Bro, when you gonna tell her? 
  Tell who what? 
  Dude, you look at Olivia the way my mom looks at her Bentley. 
  Oh, whatever, man. 
  You're tripping. 
  Tripping. 
  I call it how I see it, man. 
  Hey. 
  Who's ready to play football? 
  Feel the thunder, based on actual facts It's automatic, we run the world COREY: Going in for it right here. 
  Going hard in the paint. 
  Boom. 
  Finishing touches right there. 
  Boom. 
  Come on. 
  Hey, hey, hey. 
  I know you're not about to put them chips on my sandwich and ruin the whole thing. 
  Boy, you don't even know. 
  This crunch will change your life. 
  This crunch will break your dentures. 
  Ha ha ha! 
  Ahh. 
  Grace, tell that boy I know what I'm doing. 
  Uh-uh. 
  I am staying out of this. 
  Ha ha ha! 
  Dillon, honey, I have to work late tomorrow, so Coop is gonna pick you up from school. 
  Can Dad? 
  Please. 
  Son, grab your sandwich, go in the room, get out a puzzle. 
  I'll be in there in a minute. 
  Got it. 
  [MUMBLES.] OK. 
  Time's up. 
  Excuse me? 
  Look. 
  When I brought up Dillon's paternity, you were adamant you wouldn't discuss it then with the boys in the house. 
  I still am. 
  [SCOFFS.] OK. 
  And since then, you've pretty much avoided me. 
  For the record, I haven't been avoiding you. 
  Hey. 
  Whatever you want to call it then. 
  Look. 
  I've been gracious, but now time's up. 
  I'd like a answer to my question. 
  Are you serious? 
  What, I was taking too long to get back to you, so now you're trying to pressure me through Mom? 
  - Son, I wasn't - Wait. 
  Hold up. 
  What are you talking about, Spencer? 
  Somebody better start talking. 
  I've asked Spencer to come play for me at South Crenshaw. 
  - You what? 
  - Ma. 
  Naw. 
  Don't "Ma" me. 
  [CELL PHONE RINGING.] I have to take care of something, but this conversation is far from over. 
  Hello? 
  Ricky, dos mas. 
  Sorry, Billy. 
  I'm gonna have to cut you off, my man. 
  OK. 
  Hey. 
  Look who's here. 
  Thanks for calling. 
  Again. 
  Twice last week, 3 times this week. 
  This is the last time I'm coming to get you like this. 
  Heh heh heh. 
  Are you gonna wash your hands of me, too? 
  Look. 
  I know being away from the kids and living with a father that you barely speak to is harder than you anticipated, but I of all people can't be the one to see you through this, not if you ever plan on getting Laura back. 
  - I miss her, Gracie. 
  - Well, then boss up and do what you said you moved back to Crenshaw to do. 
  Get yourself together so you can get them back. 
  Now let's go, and you better be able to walk because ain't nobody dragging your ass to the car. 
  BOY: Hey. 
  Best linebacker in the state. 
  - Cheers, baby! 
  - Cheers, baby! 
  Oh. 
  Ladies and gentlemen, the offensive and defensive championship MVP is finally in the building! 
  - My man. 
  - What's up? 
  - Yo. 
  What's good. 
  - Nice of you to join us. 
  ASHER: Bro, you almost missed the whole celebration here. 
  Looks like y'all partied enough for the whole team. 
  You're damn right. 
  Hey. 
  I'm gonna see y'all in a bit. 
  BOY: Hey, Spencer, can we get a picture with you? 
  Thanks! 
  Awesome. 
  Thanks, Bro. 
  Oh, I think GIRL: Can we get a picture, too? 
  LAYLA: Heh heh heh. 
  That was so awesome! 
  LAYLA: Well, hello there, Mr. 
  Popular. 
  SPENCER: Whatever. 
  Well, it's well-deserved. 
  You did win us a championship after all. 
  Let's bounce, go someplace just us. 
  - You just got here. 
  - I know, but I just hate that with your dad back we barely seen each other the last couple weeks. 
  OK. 
  I missed you, too, and I promise I'll make it up to you. 
  GIRL: Layla, girl, you gonna let him up for air long enough for an intro? 
  When did you get back? 
  I got an opportunity to intern for ADS Agency. 
  Wait. 
  The sports agency? 
  That's amazing. 
  Right? 
  Hence the break from college. 
  Wasn't gonna let that pass me by. 
  28 touchdown receptions, 131 catches, 1,826 yards receiving. 
  That's an impressive season. 
  - Rochelle Mosley. 
  - It's nice to meet you. 
  Uh, Rochelle just graduated from Beverly last year and is the biggest football aficionado you will ever meet. 
  Lives and breathes it, especially Beverly Football. 
  Another Nicole Lynn in the making. 
  Something like that. 
  My dad's also one of Beverly's most influential boosters, so it comes naturally. 
  Speaking of which, he'd really like for you to join us for dinner sometime this week. 
  Yeah. 
  I got a lot going on at home right now, so OK. 
  I'ma let you slide this time, but don't think you can outrun me. 
  You're the most important part of the Beverly Football franchise right now, which makes you very important to me and my dad. 
  - Bye. 
  - Bye. 
  Damn. 
  She's, uh she's a lot. 
  Welcome to being the big man on campus, Spencer. 
  Nothing's gonna be the same for you. 
  Hey, Coach Baker. 
  It's Spencer again. 
  Look. 
  I really need to talk to you. 
  I was hoping we could connect before school. 
  Look. 
  Just hit me back, please. 
  - Hey. 
  - Hey. 
  I appreciate the ride, homey. 
  Come on, man. 
  I can't have my MVP rolling to school on the bus now, can I? 
  Yeah. 
  OK. 
  All right. 
  Damn. 
  This new? 
  Yeah. 
  Perks of a mom trying to make everything feel better. 
  Sure. 
  Must be nice. 
  MANUS: Just went through, I'll thwip again We do like spider-man Don't want none of that, fixin' to get bent I said no way How's your pops doing? 
  Don't know, don't care. 
  What? 
  Last I heard, he's staying with grandpa Willie. 
  You ain't talk to him? 
  You really want to do this, ruin this dope day in this dope new whip talking about fathers? 
  OK. 
  Fine. 
  How's how's Corey doing? 
  Yeah. 
  All right. 
  Point taken. 
  Hey. 
  Hey! 
  Nice try. 
  So are you ready to finally tell me the truth? 
  What are you talking about? 
  Layla, one minute, you're destroying your house with your bare hands, and the next you're all football Barbie on crack. 
  - What's up? 
  - Look. 
  I love that your thing is saving people, but I promise you I don't need saving. 
  I'm good. 
  I'm just tired from going over house stuff with my dad. 
  What's up? 
  And my day just got better. 
  OK? 
  Mm-hmm. 
  So How's Chris' rehab at the Atlanta facility going? 
  His parents said he's still not ready to take my calls. 
  He doesn't blame you for the hit. 
  It's just that, you know, talking to you, it's a reminder how close he came to being paralyzed. 
  I get it. 
  So I'm giving him space till he's ready. 
  Speaking of space, when are you moving back in? 
  I mean, you commuting all the way from Crenshaw to school is crazy. 
  Not to mention illegal. 
  Look. 
  Same reason I ain't trying to remind Chris of the worst moment in his life, I ain't trying to do that to your mom neither. 
  My mom is surprisingly fine. 
  I mean, she's handling the separation better than any of us. 
  [BELL RINGING.] Football season's over. 
  I'm halfway through the school year. 
  Ain't nobody gonna know or care where I'm commuting from. 
  It's all good. 
  - SPENCER: See you. 
  - LAYLA: Bye. 
  [INDISTINCT CHATTER.] MAN: Grew up on the corner as a youngin' Yo, Preach, man. 
  What's good? 
  Dang, bro, you sure you should be doing all that so soon? 
  Got to keep my strength up, don't I? 
  I mean, anyone could use your weaknesses against you, not just enemies. 
  But, man, I been calling and texting your phone since you bee out the hospital. 
  Yo seriously, what's your problem, man? 
  I saved your life. 
  You saved my life? 
  Because of you, they had to dig 4 bullets up out of me. 
  Your need to mess around with grown folks' business and war on Tyrone almost got me put in the ground. 
  If you know what's good for you, Coop, stay your raggedy ass the hell away from me. 
  Right beside me, man down, dag I'm a menace to society I always keep it G, you know I run the streets ASHER: Wait for it, wait for it. 
  - Oh, ho! 
  - Ohh! 
  Ha ha ha! 
  Yo, guys, this Us Nobody's gonna be able to touch this magic next year. 
  - JORDAN: Back to back. 
  - ASHER: Back to back, man. 
  - Back to back? 
  - Back to back! 
  - Yeah? 
  - Yeah. 
  Let's make history, right? 
  Hey, hey. 
  Play that other one. 
  Remember the I think it was in the second. 
  Hey. 
  Hold up, hold up. 
  I got to tell y'all something. 
  LANDON: There they are! 
  How's it feel? 
  State champs! 
  Proud of you boys. 
  Thanks, Principal Landon. 
  I hope your dad is enjoying his well-earned vacation. 
  I gave him that extra week, but tell him he needs to hustle back. 
  We need you boys in fighting shape for the 7-on-7 Scrimmage League. 
  - Yes, Sir. 
  - Yes, Sir. 
  All right, guys. 
  We're gonna get to class. 
  We'll catch you later, yeah? 
  JJ: Peace, peace. 
  Hey. 
  Hold up. 
  Vacation? 
  I thought you said Billy was at GW's. 
  Look. 
  Who knows, OK? 
  I got to get to class. 
  BILLY: I figured it would only be a matter of time before you showed up. 
  Ain't you supposed to be on vacation? 
  That's what Principal Landon thinks. 
  Vacation? 
  No, son. 
  I resigned. 
  Why would Landon say I [SIGHS.] Jordan must have taken my letter of resignation from off my desk. 
  So you quitting on the team, on the job you love? 
  - I'm prioritizing. 
  - Naw, man. 
  You punishing yourself. 
  - What about Jordan? 
  - Jordan don't want me there. 
  If that were true, he wouldn't have taken that letter. 
  And what about me? 
  You brought me to Beverly, man, and how you leave, and you can't be man enough to tell me to my face? 
  Look, Spencer. 
  You have no idea how hard this decision was to make. 
  Actually, I do. 
  I really do. 
  More than you know. 
  It just hurts that you wouldn't care enough about our relationship to give me a head's up. 
  I'd never do that to you. 
  - In fact, that's why I'm here. 
  - What are you talking about? 
  My pops is the new Head Coach at South Crenshaw, and he wants me to come play for him in the fall. 
  What are you planning on doing? 
  Why you care? 
  You're not the Ccoach at Beverly no more. 
  Right? 
  I'll see you around. 
  [BOTH SIGH.] What happened? 
  Where's Dillon? 
  I took Dillon across the street for a play date with Gavin. 
  Without checking with me first? 
  We need to talk alone. 
  Grace, whatever answer you give me, there's no judgment, no anger. 
  I I made peace with the fact that Dillon may be Billy's a while ago. 
  I just need to know. 
  The truth is I don't know. 
  At first, I was too scared to even ask the question, but then you left anyways. 
  - Wait a minute now. 
  - No. 
  - I - No, no, no. 
  You wait a minute. 
  You want to talk, Corey? 
  Let's really talk. 
  We made vows for better or worse, and I made a mistake, I made one big mistake, and you punish us all by leaving the boys for 8 years? 
  8 years! 
  I had to raise Spencer and Dillon by myself. 
  So, no, you don't get to walk up in here and put demands on me or my boys! 
  Because that's who they are they're mine. 
  Now if you will excuse me, I got to go pick up my son from an unsanctioned play date. 
  [SIGHS.] - What? 
  - Stealing from mom to support your harem of hos isn't the answer to your problems. 
  Oh, OK. 
  Why don't you just I don't know Mind your own business? 
  Why don't you mind your business? 
  BILLY: Hey. 
  Missed you, Dad. 
  Yeah. 
  Me, too. 
  I, uh, wanted to give you guys some space last couple of weeks, so Uh, Tahoe. 
  How was Tahoe? 
  - Bougie. 
  - Ha ha ha! 
  Look. 
  You you shouldn't be here, OK? 
  Mom wouldn't want to see you. 
  Yeah. 
  I figured as much. 
  That's why I waited for her to leave. 
  Uh, we should talk. 
  Jordan, did you take some A letter from my office last time we were there? 
  You mean your resignation letter. 
  No. 
  I mean, I read it, yeah, but I didn't take it. 
  Wait. 
  What? 
  Jordan, you were the only one there, some come on. 
  I I need it back. 
  Yeah. 
  Of course you don't believe me because, what, lying is a Baker man trait, right? 
  Hey. 
  LAURA: Guys, has anyone seen my wallet? 
  Oh. 
  H-hi. 
  Hey. 
  Is everything OK, kids? 
  Yeah. 
  I don't mind you coming by to see the kids, but maybe you could call next time. 
  Of course. 
  Yeah. 
  All right. 
  [SCHOOL BELL RINGING.] - Snitch. 
  - Snitch. 
  - Look at that snitch. 
  - Yo, Snitch. 
  Come on, man. 
  OK. 
  I mean, I know some people would have beef with you helping the cops take down Tyrone, but come on. 
  It's a little much. 
  Hey. 
  You guys still going to Nipsey's vigil tonight? 
  - Yeah. 
  - You sure you want to be seen with me? 
  I mean, you might get labeled snitch by proxy. 
  This this isn't funny. 
  Yo. 
  It ain't like me turning Tyrone in was to save my ass from prison or something, OK? 
  I was saving lives. 
  That's different. 
  You should take this seriously. 
  My uncle flip said it ain't all good in the streets. 
  Folks saying you set Tyrone up. 
  I'm just saying. 
  I'll see you. 
  All right. 
  I'll see you. 
  - See? 
  - No, I don't. 
  There's a legit reason they say, "snitches get stitches. 
  " - Come on. 
  - There's a legit reason people don't say that anymore. 
  Wow. 
  [LAURA CRYING.] MAN: Hey! 
  Let's go! 
  Let's get it! 
  We're about to get it! 
  [BOYS CHEERING.] MAN: Yo, yo, yo, yo! 
  [BLOWS WHISTLE.] Show me something, Ash. 
  Get a job done like the cake boss So that big rush running through your veins It's the same, keep it going, and you maintain - Unh! 
  - Whoo! 
 
 
 
  I wan to see you get it, up and get it Nothing is forever, you want to make it count [WHISTLES BLOWS.] They can never hold us down [WHISTLE BLOWS.] It's the same, keep it going, and you maintain [BOYS CHEERING.] [WHISTLE BLOWING.] So that big rush running through your veins It's the same, keep it going, and you maintain ROCHELLE: Spencer. 
  Hey. 
  I ain't really got right for this right now. 
  - Make time. 
  - Excuse me? 
  Are you commuting to school from Crenshaw? 
  Did you move out of the Baker house, the official address the school has on record, and if so, when? 
  Why is this any of your business? 
  It's not, but it's their business if the state championship win is in jeopardy. 
  Hold up. 
  What are you talking about? 
  The school received an anonymous tip that you're not living in the proper ZIP Code anymore. 
  They plan on doing a spontaneous check-in tomorrow to make sure you're actually living at the Baker house. 
  You can thank my dad for that. 
  Perks of being the number one booster, we get access to information like this. 
  All right. 
  So hypothetically, what happens if ain't living there? 
  You're ruled ineligible to attend Beverly and play football here, and that will be retroactive all the way to your initial transfer, which means State Championship vacated. 
  SPENCER: I just don't understand why it's got to be so hard. 
  I ain't bothering nobody. 
  Why's anyone care where I sleep? 
  Sometimes, that's just life, baby, but that doesn't mean we give up. 
  I can't ask Mrs. 
  Baker to move me back in to save Coach's team. 
  We the whole reason their marriage is falling apart. 
  What am I supposed to do, look her in the eye after all of that and beg her to take me back? 
  No. 
  Look at me, Spencer. 
  You don't have to ever beg anyone for anything. 
  Do you hear me? 
  You are a king. 
  Don't you ever forget that. 
  CAMM: I'm seeing my people get killed daily And I pry thee, mercy and grace Offer some safety in the system that hate me Boy, it date me, so I stay cuffed up We luck up and get to live for a moment Now let's turn it into something ABBEY SMITH: Change if SPENCER: Maybe this is happening for a reason. 
  I should never have came to Beverly. 
  COOP: Now you just talking stupid. 
  Bakers would still be together, and the Eagles wouldn't be in danger of losing their title. 
  And your coach would have still cheated on his wife, and the Eagles probably wouldn't even have made it to the playoffs. 
  Look. 
  Beverly Hills might have been different but not better. 
  Anyway, that's whatever now. 
  How did Coach Baker react to you playing for your pops in the fall? 
  I didn't tell him yet. 
  COOP: So you ain't tell him, you didn't tell your pop. 
  I'm saying maybe you realizing Beverly Hills ain't just some random bougie place you can shoot your shot at no more. 
  Those are people you love, a team you love, including Coach. 
  PATIENCE: Babe, you sure you're supposed to be here? 
  If you lay low for a sec, all this Tyrone mess should blow over. 
  SPENCER: Hold on. 
  What the hell they talking about? 
  Yo. 
  Y'all got big mouths, you know that? 
  Yeah? 
  Well, someone left a threat on Coop's locker after what she did to Tyrone, so Why is this the first I'm hearing about this? 
  That's why. 
  Look at your face. 
  I don't need you going all crazy trying to protect me, and ain't nobody gonna run me into hiding, OK? 
  Look at this place Bloods, Crips, Christians, Muslims. 
  Everybody came to pay their respect to Nipsey, and I'ma do the same thing. 
  Tripping. 
  PATIENCE: Yeah. 
  OK. 
  You OK? 
  Wow. 
  That's a good scent for you. 
  What is that, Eau de Bourbon? 
  OK. 
  Be careful. 
  Or what, Dad? 
  You'll resign from being my father, too? 
  Oh, wait. 
  You kind of already did that. 
  - What's this? 
  - I took your damn letter. 
  Why? 
  Why? 
  I came by your office that night to see you after leaving Chris at the hospital, and I found it on your desk. 
  - OK. 
  - How many times have you told us not to make life-changing decisions when we're crazy emotional, but that's exactly what you did. 
  So you took the letter because you wanted me to what, like, change my mind or something? 
  Hoping to give you time to come to your senses. 
  That's why I pretended to be you, and I e-mailed Principal Landon about the extra vacation. 
  - What?! 
  - Everyone is giving up on this family, and I refuse to do that. 
  I'm not giving up on this family. 
  Really? 
  So you hiding in Crenshaw, pretending to rebuild and drinking like a fish, that's you fighting for our family? 
  We all make mistakes, but we can't let them define us. 
  I mean, you taught me that, but you know what? 
  If you're totally set on maintaining the status quo and quitting on all of us, then, yeah, maybe we are better off without you. 
  FLIP: It's funny how folk look at our young black boys, our men. 
  They don't see us. 
  They see their fears and their prejudices. 
  See, Nipsey was different. 
  The whole world couldn't help but see his shining light. 
  That's why they got tears flowing from here to the Red Sea. 
  I'm sorry your pops is missing this. 
  Yeah. 
  Me, too. 
  Trust me, he'd rather be here than some board room in Culver City. 
  FLIP: He pursued his dreams of music unapologetic. 
  He did it all on his terms. 
  He wasn't just no homeboy kicking it in no neighborhood. 
  He was a pillar of the community who refused to accept defeat from those folk who kept saying our dreams weren't real, let alone valid, that we, too, couldn't be great, and, see, that's what motivated Nip to prove them haters wrong, so trust me, man, and hear me when I say Nip is a real one Philanthropist, investor, and entrepreneur, but most of all, he was a father and a son, not just to his family but a father and a son in this community. 
  Y'all don't understand. 
  This man, he proved that you ain't got to be blood to be family. 
  We got to keep investing in ourselves, investing in the communities, in each other. 
  That's how we keep our brother Ermias Asghedom's legacy alive. 
  That's how the marathon continues. 
  Show some respect. 
  Put one in the air for Nipsey Hussle. 
  [KNOCK ON DOOR.] Can we talk? 
  For weeks, I've been trying to figure out how to say what needed to be said between us, and the truth is no matter what I say doesn't change the fact that I was wrong. 
  It doesn't matter that I didn't know you at the time. 
  It doesn't matter what was going on in my own life. 
  What matters is I knew Billy was married, and in that moment, I should have respected that and walked away. 
  For that, I'm truly sorry, and even more so, I'm Sorry for moving my son into your home without being fully honest with you about everything. 
  I, uh I'm not here for forgiveness. 
  I just wanted to own my part in this and accept my blame. 
  When you're wrong, I think it's important to meet with someone directly, face to face So they can see that you mean it. 
  And I truly do. 
  Are you done? 
  [HIP-HOP PLAYING.] Ha ha ha! 
  COOP: Ha ha ha! 
  The sister. 
  What up, Coop? 
  Trying to get home, that's all. 
  Is that a problem? 
  You loose-lipped bitches running free to snitch on whoever? 
  Yeah, that's a problem. 
  You got a lot of nerve coming out here, Coop. 
  Listen. 
  If your ungrateful ass want to jump me for saving y'all's damn lives, you can try, but what I'm not gonna do is apologize for deading Tyrone's trigger-happy rampage. 
  Really, how many more brothers did Tyrone have to kill for it to be cool for me to turn him in? 
  PREACH: Hey! 
  I know y'all not about to disrespect his vigil like that. 
  Y'all didn't hear a damn word Flip said tonight. 
  Man, fall back Now. 
  Yo. 
  I heard what you said. 
  See, I live by a different code out here in these streets, so I handle things differently, but get that you did what you felt you had to do to stop the violence. 
  Ain't nobody in the crew gonna bother you or your girl anymore. 
  You're free, Coop. 
  Just keep your distance. 
  You OK? 
  Yeah, I'm good. 
  It's time to move on to the next. 
  NICK KINGSLEY AND TAYLOR MAURER: Oh, you been living free I think I know your type This is a different time of day for you. 
  You want your usual? 
  You know what? 
  Let me get a Let me get a Club Soda. 
  You got it. 
  COREY: Make that two. 
  You looking a little rough, Brother. 
  Yeah, I know. 
  I heard you moved back in with Willie. 
  How's that working out? 
  So good he high-tailed it to Florida. 
  I got to tell you I didn't see this one coming. 
  You sprinted out of Crenshaw so fast after graduation, I swore you were never coming back. 
  Did it work? 
  - Hmm. 
  - Moving back? 
  You get the answers you were looking for? 
  I been too busy hiding. 
  But that stops now. 
  What's up? 
  You out? 
  Yeah, man. 
  Book Willie a flight home. 
  I came back to make things right with him and possibly find myself again in the process. 
  That means some tough face-to-face conversations, and can't do that while he's in Florida. 
  Oh. 
  Spencer told me about your offer. 
  Wondering when this was gonna come up. 
  So let me guess. 
  You gonna fight to keep him. 
  No. 
  Blood or no blood, Spencer's family. 
  I just want what's best for him. 
  If he decides to play for you, then so be it. 
  Um You just have to do right by him. 
  [KNOCK ON DOOR.] Mrs. 
  Baker. 
  Hi, Spencer. 
  Come in. 
  I realized today that hiding from my pain doesn't make it go away, and neither does placing it where it doesn't belong. 
  Whatever's going on between me and Billy and your mom has nothing to do with you. 
  The one thing we can all agree on Is how How much we love you. 
  Sometimes It's important to say what you need to say face to face so that the person can see that you really mean it, so whenever you're ready, your room at my house is waiting for you. 
  [LOCK BEEPS.] [CELL PHONE CHIMES.] [KNOCK ON DOOR.] - Hey. 
  - Hey. 
  OK. 
  Thanks for coming. 
  Oh, of course, of course. 
  Look. 
  Um, about yesterday. 
  Me first, please. 
  OK. 
  OK. 
  There's been enough casualties from this mess Billy and I created. 
  I'm gonna get the paternity test done. 
  Everybody deserves the truth. 
  You deserve to know if Dillon is your son or not. 
  You're right. 
  There have been enough casualties. 
  That's why I think we should leave well enough alone. 
  - What? 
  - It was different when I thought the truth was already out there, but it's not. 
  Look. 
  Blood or no blood, I love Dillon like he's my own, and he already thinks he has his father back. 
  Why should we risk upending all of that? 
  You're serious. 
  It's time we stopped making our kids pay for the adults' mistakes. 
  [H. E. R. 'S "HARD PLACE" PLAYING.] [HUMMING.] Aah! 
  Ha! 
  Hi! 
  [HUMMING CONTINUES.] Welcome back, Brother. 
  Thanks, man. 
  H. E. R: if I have to choose LAURA: So who's hungry? 
  I can cook, or we can KIDS: Takeout. 
  Very funny. 
  H. E. R. : What if nothing ever will change? 
  Oh, I'm caught between your love And a hard place So do you have any idea who called in the tip about you not living here? 
  Nope, but whoever it is better hope I never find out. 
  Well, regardless, I'm just glad it brought you back home. 
  I'm sorry. 
  I Of course our home is with Grace and Dillon in Crenshaw. 
  - I just meant. 
  - No. 
  You used the right word. 
  Beverly's my home, too. 
  I guess I just needed reminding of that. 
  [DEAN LEWIS' "WAVES" PLAYING.] - Are you done - Thank you. 
  Aah! 
  Aah! 
  Ha ha ha! 
  LEWIS: There is a swelling storm And I'm caught up in the middle of it all And it takes control Of the person that I thought I was The boy I used to know But there is a light in the dark And I feel its warmth in my hands, in my heart But why can't I hold on? 
  Look at the old man. 
  Hey. 
  How was your ride up from Nevada? 
  Long. 
  Man, thanks for convincing Mom to let me come stay with you. 
  Come on. 
  LEWIS: It comes and goes in waves And carries us away
