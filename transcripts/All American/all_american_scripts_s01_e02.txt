 BILLY: Spencer James? Billy Baker, Varsity Coach, Beverly high.   
 I'll cut to the chase, Spencer.   
 I need you to come play for me.   
 But you can't recruit.   
 I can get around that.   
 Welcome to Beverly Hills.   
 OLIVIA: Leila keating,   
 Beverly Hills' resident sweetheart.    
 Jordan Baker, qb, team captain.    
 Coach is my dad. Well, our dad.    
 Chatsworth is contesting your transfer permit.    
 LANDON: They're accusing of recruiting.    
 That's not gonna fly, not with the board.    
 Maybe there's another way.    
 GRACE: You sure about this, living in Beverly Hills?    
 SPENCER: During the week, with coach Baker and his family; That way, I qualify for the district.    
 On weekends, I'll be home with you.    
 Hey, Gracie, we need to talk.    
 We got to tell Spencer the truth.

- Hey.    
 This is what rich kids do at   P.M. on a Tuesday.    
 Hey, it's not all fun and games. 
We get work done, too.    
 Look, the student council's here.    
 We're prepping for the big football booster party this week, and this year, the pressure's on because everybody is coming to meet our new star player.    
 That's you, in case you were curious.    
 What's up, ash?    
 You know what's up.    
 Guy's hitting on my girl left and right,    
 knocked me out of the game last week.    
 - That boy needs to go. 
- Seriously?    
 We gave chatsworth the tip on his transfer permit to get him kicked out, ok? We tried.    
 - You tried. 
- Exactly.    
 And look how that turned out.  
 Homeboy's living in my house now.    
 Face it, ash. He's here to stay.    
 Hey, you're not leaving, are you?    
 It's getting late.    
 It's just getting started.    
 Beers, a bonfire, s'mores.    
 Jj's got his guitar out.    
 [TUNING GUITAR]     
 Sandcastles and John Mayer sing-alongs.     
 [GIGGLES] Ok.     
 It sounds tempting, but, uh, I got business to take care of.     
 Business?     
 Very mysterious, Spencer James.     
 That's how I like it.     
 SPENCER: Ok, so find a number you can divide by    .     
 - DILLON:    ? 
- There you go, little man.     
 You've got this.     
 You know, it'd be easier if I could just send my homework to you in Beverly Hills, and you can just send it back.     
 We can work out some kind of system.     
 Oh, a system, huh?     
 - Yeah. 
- Yeah? You're funny.     
 [LAUGHING] No, no, no! Stop. Stop, stop, stop.     
 Again?     
 I just came by to help d with his homework,     
 - that's all. 
- And last night, it was     
 I had to sign some test.     
 And the night before that...     
 - he had... 
- To get his favorite sweatshirt,     
 - and he had to... 
- man, shut up.     
 [GRACE SIGHS] Spencer, this was not the deal.     
 You were supposed to be there on weeknights, here on the weekends.     
 Yeah, I miss you, too.     
 You know we miss you, but you can't keep going back and forth like this.     
 You're gonna blow your shot, baby.     
 GRACE: We're good.     
 Come here.

 No, you got it twisted is what you got.

 I'm just looking out is all.     
 Ain't nobody here need looking out for.     
 Seems to me they do. You're either here or there. Can't be everywhere.

 - Much. 
- Well, good, good.     
 - Ok. 
- There's-s...

 - Ok. You... you good? 
- Ow!     
 - No. Ok. 
- You sure?     
 You don't need a... ok.     
 Morning, Spencer.     
 Hey, morning, ma'am.     
 Oh, I told you, please call me Laura.     
 Nah. If I did that, my moms would reach clear over from crenshaw to slap me upside my head, so...     
 Ok. Understood.     
 What can I get you for breakfast?     
 We have cereal...     
 Juice, fruit.     
 And we're making omelets.     
 - That'd be great. 
- Cool.     
 JORDAN: Dad, hawthorne's too fast for us to play like we did last week, ok?     
 The only chance we have is if we switch it up on offense, keep them guessing.     
 BILLY: What are you thinking?     
 I say we come out with a heavy run game out the gate.     
 SPENCER: Actually, their offense is where it's at right now.     
 They got the highest scoring in the district.     
 You're... he's right. He's right.     
 We have to figure out how to lock up their receivers.     
 - Have you played them before? 
- SPENCER: No.     
 I just been doing some digging.     
 I stayed up watching game tape last night after I got in.     
 You've been getting in late often.     
 You cool? You gonna be solid for this week?     
 - Yeah, I'm good. 
- BILLY: All right.     
 - Ooh! Geez. 
- Sorry, Mom.     
 - Morning, livvie. 
- [SPENCER CHUCKLES]     
 - BILLY: Good morning. 
- [PLATE CLATTERS]     
 - I said, "good morning." 
- Morning, dad.     
 Great. See, number  , that's their best guy offensively, but he's their playmaker right there.     
 But he don't like to play physical...     
 BOTH: So we got to take advantage of him on run play.     
 On the run play.     
 [CHUCKLES]     
 Ain't no way he's blocking me.     
 All right. Let's see you.     
 That's what I'm talking about.     
 - Yes, sir. 
- Confidence.     
 Confidence.     
 My man.

 Go on, man. Get it over. Make your Mark!     
   and  !     
 Hey, Coop! Coop!     
 Coop! Hold up, man. 
We got business to handle.     
 Look, Spencer was right.     
 We hung out a few times and all that, but the gang-banging? It ain't for me.     
 You need my protection. 
I don't need nothin'.     
 You'll come around.     
 BOY: Whoo! All right.     
 [OVERLAPPING SHOUTING]     
 [WHISTLE BLOWS]     
 BILLY: Every team is only as strong as their weakest player.

 BILLY: It's just a sprain.     
 He'll be fine, but he's out for this week's game.     
 Dad, we need to rotate our receivers.     
 What you need to do is put me in.     
 Look, I can play both ways, coach, offense and defense.     
 JORDAN: And what hppens when you get gassed out there, Spence?     
 Why don't you let me worry about my game, ok?     
 You just worry about getting me the ball.     
 Jordan, why don't you give me and Spencer a moment?     
 All right, so what do you say, coach?     
 Uh... I say no.     
 Look, I'm the only one here with his future riding on this season.     
 These other guys ain't got nothing to lose.     
 I feel you on that, and believe you me,     
 I got the boosters and the board, everybody's breathing down my neck, but I have a responsibility to you.     
 You think I don't notice you getting in late every night, you going back home every day?     
 And what about my moms? 
What about Dillon?     
 If I ain't there to take care of them, who is?     
 Look, you are burning it at both ends off the field.     
 I can't have you doing it on the field as well.     
 Look, man, I left behind my family, a'ight, my friends, my school.     
 - I left behind who I am. 
- I understand that.     
 I'm trying to protect you.     
 I didn't come here to be protected.     
 I came here to win, and the way I see it,     
 I ain't the only one with it all on the line here.     
 Now, our best chance at winning this game is with me on both sides of the ball, and we both know that.     
 [SCOFFS]     
 BILLY: All right, y'all. 
Come on. Hurry up.     
 The boosters do not like to be kept waiting.     
 [KEYS JANGLE]     
 [INDISTINCT CHATTER]     
 BILLY: Spencer, what's going on? 
We're leaving. Get... get dressed.     
 I am dressed.     
 And you know what? You look great.     
 You do. It's just these things are so...     
 - stupid and pretentious? 
- Hey, easy. Yeah, yeah, no.     
 Just throw on a blazer and snazz that outfit up.     
 I don't have a blazer here.     
 Uh... ok, no problem.     
 We'll just swing by your house on the way, you can grab one,     
 - and we'll go from there. 
- Boom.     
 No, I mean...     
 Look, I ain't got one there, either.     
 You know what I say, honestly?     
 Wear what you want.     
 To hell with the boosters, isn't that right, boys?     
 BILLY: Yes, yes, yes. You're good.     
 OLIVIA: Uh, you guys go. 
I'll take care of it.     
 Spencer and I will just meet you there.     
 Dad, I said I'll take care of it.     
 Are you... ok, let's go, guys.     
 We just double the tape up, stick it right here, and bam.     
 Well...     
 Don't you clean up nice?     
 You know, you're good at this.     
 [SNICKERS] Having pants?     
 No...     
 Making people feel better.     
 You sure Jordan won't mind?     
 No, no. This one's my dad's.     
 Looks like you two are a perfect match.     
 So, what is this booster party, anyway?     
 Just a bunch of old blowhards knocking back craft cocktails and congratulating themselves about a football team they had nothing to do with.     
 But they fund the sports program, so my dad sucks it up, and with Beverly coming off yet another losing season, the pressure's on and I guess that's where you come in.     
 I didn't realize it was that bad.     
 Yeah, I don't really remember much about my dad playing ball...     
 But what I do remember is how he was after...distant, no real purpose, until my Mom heard Beverly needed a new coach, and then the light came back in his eyes.     
 I'd just hate to see him lose that again, you know?     
 [SIGHS]     
 Now...     
 Let's get Beverly's new star player to the party to impress.     
 Damn.     
 Is that him? That the boy that took you out?     
 OLIVIA: Leave it to Beverly hills to keep it simple.     
 LEILA: Spencer, thank god you're here.     
 David shea was asking for... What?     
 I just didn't know you'd be here.     
 I told you, I'm stu-co president.     
 We sponsor all the booster events.     
 Oh, uh, sorry if I interrupted you guys.     
 I mean, hey, why stop now?     
 SPENCER: Ahem.     
 Well, you look great in your suit.     
 - Thank you. 
- And when you have a minute, I know the boosters are dying to meet you.     
 Can't wait.     
 Ok.     
 MAN: You've got to jam the line to prevent them getting behind you.     
 - Am I right? 
- Yes, sir. We'll be ready for them.     
 WOMAN: I mean, with Asher Adams out, what you need to do is bring the new kid in on offense.     
 MAN  : Now, coach, with his strength, you might as well put him at running back, too.     
 MR. ADAMS: What's in those wheaties they're feeding you over at crenshaw? All you boys down there seem to be running sub- .    s.     
 - "You boys"? 
- Hi.     
 I'm sorry, Mr. Adams. I need to steal Spencer for a second.     
 Let's go.     
 So what's your story, anyway?     
 You and Olivia? What's that all about?     
 Ok, last time I asked you to size me up, you cut straight to my "lonely rich girl" core.     
 Hey, that's my bad, ok? I didn't mean to make you feel like that.     
 No, I mean...     
 You're right. I am alone.     
 My dad travels a lot for work... New York, Paris.     
 Hey, at least you know where he is.     
 My dad left a few years ago.     
 I ain't seen him since.     
 Why did he leave?     
 Your guess is as good as mine.     
 Said he got some big new job somewhere, and I guess we weren't part of the plan.     
 Well, my dad's always about the big plan... producing career, wife he was madly in love with.     
 I think they just had one kid 'cause...     
 They only had so much love left to give.     
 And then... Two years ago, we were all on vacation on Aspen and... ah, living the bougie life.     
 Um...     
 My Mom never liked to ski.     
 She was more of a "sit in the lounge room and drink hot cocoa" type.     
 She said she needed to go home, asked me to come with her.     
 Um, she never made it to the airport.     
 Car accident, so...     
 She was just gone.     
 Hey, look, I'm sorry, ok?     
 I didn't know.     
 It's ok.     
 It is what it is, right?     
 I guess I just thought you had it made.     
 You can come from anywhere and have a sad story, Spencer.     
 Yeah.     
 Um, we should get back to the party.     
 - Yeah. 
- Yeah.     
 BILLY: Whew.     
 Hey, what's happening, man?     
 Another scotch on the rocks for me, and whatever the coach is drinking.     
 Not much of a gesture at an open bar,     
 - but I'll cover the tip. 
- Well, I appreciate that.     
 Let me just get a beer, please.     
 I'm... I'm sorry we won't have your boy out there with us this week.     
 Thanks.     
 Are you now?     
 Yeah, injuries.     
 They're, uh, they're part of the game, you know?     
 Asher's the best receiver you got, and you let that south crenshaw thug rough him up during practice?     
 Whoa. [SMACKS LIPS]     
 Mind yourself now, Harold.     
 Just calling like I see it.     
 Ok, well, thanks for the drink.     
 When they hired you, I had high hopes.     
 Sure, your pro career was a bust.     
 But, hey, that's the game.     
 After two losing seasons and with another one on the way, guess you're just getting comfortable with losing.     
 Uh...     
 - that's enough. 
- Oh, it's ok.     
 - Dad, I'm... 
- it's all right.     
 Coach, I'm... I'm sorry.     
 Why should you be sorry?     
 He's the reason you got hurt!     
 Him and his son!     
 What are you talking about?     
 Talking about how Jordan was behind that contested permit, and now your crenshaw boy is bringing his anger about the situation on our field, injuring my son!     
 - ASHER: Dad, will you... 
- Hey.     
 That's right!     
 Jordan Baker's the one that gave chatsworth the tip.     
 Are you serious?     
 SPENCER: You're the reason I can't go home at night?     
 - Face it, coach. 
- Oh, boy.     
 That boy doesn't belong here, and neither do you.     
 - Call me boy one more time. 
- Dad.     
 That's exactly what they want you to do.     
 [OVERLAPPING CHATTER]     
 SPENCER: You know what?     
 - You know what? I'm done walking away. 
- Shh, shh, shh. Ok.     
 I say we show these Beverly hills boys what we're made of.     
 Let me play both ways, coach. Come on.     
 Please.     
 You think you can hold up if I put you on both sides of the ball?     
 - I know I can. 
- You got to have that offensive playbook down by tomorrow night.     
 Do you got me?     
 Got you.     
 - All right. 
- I got you, coach.     
 Get out of here. Get out of here.     
 BILLY: Uh-uh, not so fast.     
 We need to talk.     
 Sit down.     
 Please, please tell me that you weren't behind this contested permit mess.     
 BILLY: Come on, man.     
 With all that you have, why would you try to hurt someone with less?     
 LAURA: Honey, I'm sure that's not what he was trying to do.     
 Ok.     
 Well? What is it, then?     
 I don't know.     
 I just... [SCOFFS] Yeah, I was out on that field.     
 Just scored, feeling on top of the world.     
 Feel... feeling like... like I'd finally made you proud.     
 Turned around, and there you were, patting his back, calling him "son," and... I just reacted.     
 Well, if you felt that way, you should have came to me. Why didn't you come to me?     
 Really? Because you moved him into this house without even asking any of us.     
 Without ask... that may be the case, but I'm still disappointed in you, Jordan.     
 - What's new, dad? 
- LAURA: Jordan.     
 No, no. You know, it's fine. I'm always disappointing him, right?     
 - Wait. That is not true. 
- It is and you know it.     
 What is it you said? Heh! Oh, that's right.     
 "There's no one on this team with even half Spencer's potential," right?     
 Hey.     
 Jordan.     
 Jordan!     
 LAURA: Well, that went great.     
 This isn't... this... is all this about football?     
 Dad!     
 Do you really not see what's happening?     
 You have a son who is desperate for your approval.     
 Why do you think he even picked up a football?     
 And you also have a daughter just out of rehab, and the one person you're focused on, the one person you're trying to save is Spencer.     
 - Baby girl... 
- no, look,     
 I am so happy that you care about Spencer.     
 It's the right thing to do, but there are other people in this house that need you, too, dad.     
 - Good night. 
- 'Night.     
 [FOOTSTEPS RETREATING]

- [SIGHS]     
 It's a weeknight. Mom's not gonna be happy.     
 Yeah, I'll handle Mom. I got to learn this playbook.     
 You went to the comic book store?     
 Your friend Shawn hooked me up. 
You know, he seems cool.     
 Look at me.     
 He's not my friend, and he's not cool, a'ight?     
 Don't let me ever hear you've been talking to him again.     
 You understand me?     
 [QUIETLY] Mm-hmm.     
 Dillon.     
 I do.     
 [SIGHS] Look, I'm sorry, man.     
 I ain't mad at you, a'ight?     
 Where you going?     
 To make sure Shawn leaves you the hell alone.     
 - [INDISTINCT CHATTER] 
- SPENCER: Hey!     
 MAN: Hey, homes.     
 Headed in the wrong direction.     
 Rodeo drive is the other way.     
 Leave my brother alone, a'ight?     
 Was just offering the kid a little community kindness, that's all.     
 Stop playing like you something you're not, Shawn.     
 You're the worst part of what this community is.     
 Hey, watch yourself.     
 You're the same piece of nothing you were in grade school, you know that?     
 You'll always be nothing.     
 [SCOFFS]     
 You want to come at me, come at me.     
 - Yeah. 
- COOP: Shawn! Shawn!     
 SPENCER: Hey, Coop, no.     
 Listen, shut up.     
 - What are you doing? 
- Dillon called, man. He was worried.     
 
 
 
 Hey, look we're good, right? 
Just walk away.     
 Are we?     
 Come on, man. I'll meet you tonight, just like you want.     
 Look who's protecting who now.     
 Let's go.     
 MAN: Hey, later, homie.     
 SHAWN: I don't know what he thought this was.     
 MAN: He not over here. Exactly.     
 How could you do this to me right now?     
 COOP: Do this to you? 
This ain't about you.     
 Shawn been at me ever since you left.     
 So why you ain't just tell me, huh?     
 Tell you for what?     
 So you can be caught up in this mess, getting beat up, getting a gun put in your damn face?     
 This is exactly what I try to protect you from.     
 Protect me?     
 That's right. You and your future.     
 Look, I don't want anybody's protection.     
 I didn't ask for any of that.     
 And I didn't ask you to protect me, neither, bro.     
 But you did, for a long time.     
 But that's over now.     
 You cannot save the world, Spencer.     
 You got to save yourself.     
 'Cause out here, it's every man for themself.     
 Coop.     
 Hey.     
 Coop!     
 - Whose house is this? 
- Our house!     
 - Whose house is this? 
- Our house!     
 We gonna kick them out of our house?     
 - Hell, yeah! 
- Get 'em, boys!     
 STADIUM ANNOUNCER: Ok, folks, it's  th down and  .     
 Looks like hawthorne is going for it.

 - Dad, I think he's hurting. 
- Say what?     
 Something's not right. I think he's hurting.     
 - No, he's just winded. 
- Dad.     
 Listen, just hit your receivers.     
 Don't worry about me; I'm hitting everyone who knows the playbook.     
 Strong left,    stretch. On  , on  . Ready?     
 ANNOUNCER:  rd down and  , late in the fourth quarter,     
 Beverly hanging on to a  -point lead.     
 If they get a first down here, Beverly can run out the clock.     
 Looks like a busted play!     
 What's happening? What's happening?     
 Laterals to James.     
 He fumbles! Hawthorne's got it!     
 Down  ! The   ! Touchdown!     
 With time running out, the eagles trailing by  . It all comes down to this play.     
 - Come on, now. 
- All right, boys,   seconds left.     
 One big play.     
 Double move. Give it all you got.     
 Spencer, you're out. 
Butler, get in there.     
 - What? 
- Get in there, Butler! Double move!     
 - BILLY:   seconds! 
- Coach.     
 Go see the trainer.     
 Hey, coach, don't do this.     
 [PLAYERS SHOUTING INDISTINCTLY]     
 BILLY: All right, son. 
You know what it is.     
 ANNOUNCER: Baker up.     
 Here's the snap.     
 BILLY: There he is, there he is...     
 ANNOUNCER: Got Butler streaking down the sideline!     
 He lets it go!     
 Just outside the outstretched arms of Butler.     
 And that's the game, ladies and gentlemen,     
 Beverly losing another close one.     
 All right, brother.     
 Keep your head up.     
 We both know I would have caught that.     
 Probably, but, uh... 
That's not the point.     
 Then what is?     
 Raise your left arm, Spencer.     
 - Come on. 
- Go ahead. Raise it up.     
 Higher. Above your head.     
 [EXHALES SHARPLY]     
 There, see? You're hurt.     
 And you could have risked a serious injury trying to do it all.     
 Doesn't matter.     
 You never should have pulled me.     
 Well, you never should have been on offense to begin with.     
 All right? I put too much on you.     
 Let them damn boosters get in my head and...     
 - and that's on me. 
- No.     
 This loss is on you.     
 Every loss is on me.     
 My job requirement is to win games, but what I know now is I care more about you than I do about winning.     
 One play,  seconds.     
 You leave me in, and we're celebrating right now.     
 [FOOTSTEPS RETREATING]     
 [EXHALES]     
 [GRUNTS]     
 [GRUNTS]     
 Oh, wait.     
 What?     
 Just make sure to be careful.     
 Don't want you fumbling the juice.     
 You got jokes this morning, huh?     
 Tension breaker.     
 Had to be done.     
 Hey, look, I got something for you.     
 No way!     
 You like that?     
 Hey, I really am sorry, all right?     
 And I'm sorry I lost last night.     
 I know y'all are counting on me.     
 I asked you to take this shot to give yourself a chance at something more.     
 So what if you lost a game?     
 I came to Beverly to win.     
 What good am I otherwise?     
 Spencer...     
 Win or lose, you are so much more     
 than what you are on that field.     
 You push yourself so damn hard trying to take care of us all.     
 And you've been like that ever since your daddy left, trying to prove something to yourself and to him.     
 But you can't hold up the world on your own, baby.     
 Ok?     
 [SIGHS]     
 I'm here.     
 What's so important?     
 Look, we haven't talked since you got back from rehab.     
 - I thought that... 
- Thought what?     
 That we should.     
 Look, I... I know that I haven't been the best boyfriend to Leila, but I want to change that.     
 And with Spencer at Beverly now...     
 I feel like she's pulling away.     
 I want to make sure that you and I are on the same page... there is no "you and I."     
 It was one drug-induced screw-up.     
 We got caught up in the moment, and I had to walk away from my best friend because of it.     
 I lost Leila, and I have to live with that guilt for the rest of my life.     
 We both have to live with it.     
 Then let's just keep pretending that it didn't happen, ok?     
 Leila deserves at least that from us.     
 Is this another intervention?     
 Because I can't handle another rambling letter from Jordan right now.     
 LAURA: No, honey.     
 Dad just has something he wants to say.     
 BILLY: Have a seat. Thank you, baby.     
 Uh... you're right.     
 I brought Spencer to Beverly Hills because I thought it was right for me, and Spencer, um,but I didn't... I didn't consider you guys.     
 I didn't, and for that, I... I apologize.     
 I know, win or lose, job or no job, uh, the most important thing to me is not football.     
 It's you guys.     
 Yeah, I'm sorry.     
 I just wish I would have told you that a little bit sooner.     
 It's up to you guys whether or not Spencer stays because, uh, if you guys aren't cool, if we're not cool as a family, then it's not the right thing to do for anyone, even Spencer.     
 So if we say no, he's gone, just like that?     
 Just like that.

 It's more than good. 
It's kind of amazing.
