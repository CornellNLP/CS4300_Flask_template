 MAN: Spencer James?    
 My bad. Didn't mean to, uh, startle you.    
 Geez.    
 It's, like, one minute you're scoring, then the next...    
 Another day in the neighborhood.    
 Yeah.    
 Billy Baker, varsity coach, Beverly High.    
 - Beverly Hills, huh? 
- Yes, sir.    
 I'll cut to the chase, Spencer. I've had my eye on you.    
 You got strong hands, you match up well against single coverage.    
 Saw that film on you with the   touchdowns against Fairfax last season, yeah.    
 Yeah, I need you to come play for me.    
 - Play for you? 
- Play for me.    
 But you can't recruit. [CHUCKLES]    
 I mean, I'm sorry. Those are the rules. Season's started.    
 I switch teams, I'm benched   months.    
 No. Not with me. I can get around that.    
 Now, I'm assuming you want to play pro eventually. Am I right?    
 - Yes, sir. 
- Yeah, well, I can help out with that.    
 You know, South Crenshaw, you got a strong team, and Beverly Hills, we've had a couple of rough seasons, but I'm gonna turn that around this year.    
 Plus, we can offer you something that Crenshaw can't.    
 Is that right?    
 A better education at a safer school.    
 I can get you a way out, man.    
 Look, I played in the NFL, all right, for a couple years till I busted my knee, but I still have all those contacts.    
 I can make all your NFL dreams a reality.    
 But take it from me, man, from experience, every player out there is just one injury away from needing a back-up plan.    
 Look, I appreciate the offer, Coach, but, uh...    
 I don't need a back-up.    
 This is where I belong.    
 All right.    
 - You have a good night. 
- Yes, sir. Be safe.    
 - Yo, Spence. 
- Hey, what's up?

 - and she's totally hot. 
- Wait, what are we talking about?    
 "Saga," Mom. Are you even listening?    
 There's only two kind of people in this world...people who read "saga" and people who don't.    
 - You don't want to be the latter. 
- MOM: I'll keep that in mind, Dillon.    
 Well, look who decided to get up.    
 I'm definitely up now. 
No hot water again?

- Coop, those girls roll with Shawn.     
 - You really want to play like that? 
- Listen, that weak-ass, wannabe gangbanger can't touch me.     
 Plus, I got you for back-up anyway.     
 - Don't touch me like that.

 What's up, homie?     
 - I can explain. 
- You don't have to.     
 Coach Baker already explained everything.     
 How you doing, Spencer?     
 - How could you not tell me, Spencer? 
- Mom.     
 Don't "Mom" me right now.     
 So that's how it is?     
 I say no, you just go around me?     
 - Spencer, I just wanted to help. 
- I don't need help, man.     
 - I'm happy where I'm at. 
- GRACE: Happy? Is that right?     
 You think I didn't hear about that shooting over at Crenshaw the other night?     
 That I didn't get a call about your little fight?     
 You've been in and out of trouble at that school for years.     
 I'm a clerk down at the courthouse.     
 I see this type of stuff all the time.     
 Good kids gone bad, getting caught up with gangs.     
 Did you know there are over active gangs in the L.A. area?     
 - Not helping. 
- Look, Spencer, I went to Crenshaw, but somebody gave me a chance.     
 Somebody helped me find a way out.     
 Please let me find you one.     
 I mean, hell, my own kids go to Beverly.     
 - So maybe your father... 
- I don't have a father, not anymore.     
 GRACE: Corey left a few years back.     
 He went to coach college ball in Nevada. We haven't seen him since.     
 BILLY: Oh, well, I'm sorry to hear that.     
 That's, uh, that's a shame.     
 You're breezing by at Crenshaw, barely cracking open a book.     
 You're smart, Spencer, and you could make something of your life beyond just football.     
 Football is my dream.     
 You may not believe in that dream, but I do.     
 You don't think I know why you don't want to take this shot?     
 You don't want to be like your dad.     
 You're a good man.     
 You're proud of who you are.     
 And, Spencer, I am so damn proud of you for that.     
 You have no idea.     
 But choosing not to take an opportunity like this...     
 Take it from me, that's not really choosing.     
 Tell me I'm wrong.     
 Tell me that going to Beverly isn't the best thing for you, baby.

 Welcome to Beverly Hills.     
 Now, remember, you're here on an academic permit, which can be revoked if you don't maintain your GPA.     
 But I've seen your records. 
That shouldn't be an issue... exceptional grade average, above-grade-level testing.     
 You won't miss a day at play.     
 Look, no fighting or it's over. One and done.     
 Look, I just did what I needed to get by.     
 I know. See you at practice.     
 WOMAN: All right, listen up.     
 I want you all to do a search on chromosomal DNA and make a slide on how it connects with last week's work on protein.     
 - Spencer, right? 
- Yes, ma'am.     
 It's OK if you don't have a computer.     
 Just pair up with a classmate for now.     
 OK. Thank you.     
 Hey, Todd.     
 Keep watching that Logan Paul feed.     
 TODD: Whatever, Olivia.     
 You can share with me.     
 Thank you.     
 I'll warn you, my chromosomal DNA knowledge is non-existent at best.     
 I might be able to help with that.

 The team's gonna be much stronger this year.     
 - We're gonna be putting up points. 
- You better, 'cause, as you're well aware, the Boosters provide funding for our sports program, funding that'll dry up fast without a title this year.     
 - And without one... 
- Or I'm gonna be out of a job.     
 - Is that it? 
- Nobody's talking changes right now.     
 We just...

- OK.

 This is Hadley, Leila, and up top, Lucy, JJ, and Asher.     
 Hey, what's up? Spencer.     
 - Hey. 
- Hey.     
 I think you and Asher play the same position.     
 - ASHER: What's up, man? 
- Oh, receiver, huh?     
 Yeah, broke the school record for receptions last season.     
 - Me, too. 
- So how are you liking Beverly so far?     
 It's OK, I guess.     
 I know it probably feels like Lost footage or rich kids from Instagram, but it's not so bad once you give it a chance.     
 - I'm sure it'll grow on me. 
- Hey, so lay it on me.     
 Crips or Bloods?     
 Excuse me?     
 I'm dying to check out a Crip walk for real.     
 I've only seen one on YouTube.     
 Yo, yo, he's just joking, man. Ignore him.     
 Asher, you wouldn't know a Crip walk if it bit you in the damn white ass.     
 That didn't sound like a joke to me, bro.     
 - Don't be so sensitive. 
- Sensitive?     
 Hey, yo, thanks for the welcome.     
 - Asher. 
- What?     
 - I was making conversation. 
- No, you were being an ass.     
 Hey.     
 Um, I'm sorry about Asher.     
 I know how he can come off, but he's really not that bad once you get to know him.     
 - Is that right? 
- I think he's intimidated by you.     
 - I think they all are. 
- Those guys?

 They got it made.     
 Me, I had to catch   buses to get here today.     
 And I've been wearing my cousin Ray's hand-me-downs since I was born.     
 And you know ray loves him some polyester.     
 OK, don't nobody like polyester.     
 OK, but aren't you some like crazy good football player?     
 I do all right.     
 You just got to see the field.     
 Right there, that guy.     
 Gait's off, loose hands. 
Yo, yo, he about to fall.     
 - Oh! 
- How did you do that?     
 Happened the first time I picked up a ball.     
 It was just a twitch of the fingers, a look, a tick.     
 So do me.     
 I mean, read me or whatever it is.     
 You're like a defensive back.     
 A defensive back?     
 - Gee, thanks. 
- I just mean you're confident, smart.     
 You like attention. You like to call the plays.     
 That's not the most interesting thing about you.     
 I saw it the minute you crossed the yard.     
 You're lonely.     
 Defensive backs, they like to play on an island, always by themselves.     
 I was kind of hoping for a super power,     
 - but not even close, huh? 
- I ain't always right, so.     
 I should get to class.     
 But I'm glad you came to Beverly.

 Maybe it should be.

 [CLAPS] All right, we're gonna mix it up a little bit.     
 All right, Spencer, you ever played safety?     
 - No, why? 
- Give it a try.     
 Man, I don't play defense.     
 You play what I tell you to play.     
 - So you're just gonna change my position? 
- Spencer.     
 After everything we talked about? 
Man, I didn't come here for this.     
 - I came here to score touchdowns. 
- You came here to play football as a team.     
 Am I right or am I right?     
 Thank you.     
 You got one of two choices, son.     
 You can either be on this side of the line or that side of the line.

- BILLY: Atta boy.     
 All right. Good work, son.     
 - Whoo! 
- Good stuff.     
 That's how you play football.     
 You better get comfortable there.     
 And I'm playing with a bunch of guys who don't want me for a coach who said he'd have my back and he moved me off the defense.     
 And I'm supposed to what, play along, help them win their season?     
 Then don't.     
 What, throw the season?     
 No, make it your season.     
 You'll find a way. I know you will.     
 - You let some lily white coach... 
- He's black.     
 Black?     
 - I don't know then. Maybe he right. 
- Man, shut up.     
 Listen, man, for real.     
 Black, white, plaid, it don't matter.     
 You just got to do you.     
 You got the goods on and off the field.     
 I knew it from the moment I met you right here in this park.     
 Man, I don't know, Coop.

 - Hey. 
- Hey, what up?     
 So, come here often?     
 Every Wednesday after the club.     
 I suppose you got a place like this, right?     
 - Uh, yeah, it's kind of like this. 
- Do you live close?     
 - Yeah, I'm just... just down the street there. 
- Bigger?     
 I mean, I... you know, I don't really compare.     
 - It's not the size that matters. 
- OK.     
 BILLY: Look, you think I want to drag my ass all the way to Crenshaw?     
 You think I did it out of the kindness of my heart?     
 All right, I didn't whip up a smart kid permit so I could mold young minds.     
 No, no, no.     
 Look, I would not have recruited him if anybody on the squad had half of his potential.     
 OK, I understand that.     
 Why don't you bring all the Boosters down this Saturday, and I will show you what he can do.     
 Yes, sir. Yes.     
 Spencer James, he's gonna bring it home for us.     
 Trust me. Yes, sir.     
 All right, take care.     
 You seeing this?     
 Yeah.     
 We need to get rid of him.     
 So how was it hanging out with the steroid set?     
 - Are you serious? 
- No. No, I just like to mess with Jordan.     
 So what's up with you two anyway?     
 Y'all don't seem too close.     
 I mean, we used to be close, and then high school happened.     
 He became a big football star and I became this, the social pariah of Beverly High.     
 - Man, shut up. You're cool. 
- OK, yeah, says the new guy.     
 It's shocking, I know, but no one's super eager to hang out with sober girl post rehab, so...     
 Rehab?     
 Elaborate.     
 I just went down a bad path and tried to drown it out with pills, parents freaked, and here I am.     
   k and    days later, I'm good as new.     
 It's... it's fine now.     
 Is it?     
 You know, you're the first person to even ask me that.     
 LEILA: Spencer.     
 Oh, hey, what's up?     
 Hey, so I'm throwing a party at my place tonight.     
 It's just a small team thing to celebrate the start of the season, and I was hoping you could make it.     
 Yeah, for sure. I'll come by for a bit.     
 - Great. 
- Cool.     
 Cool.     
 - Bye, Olivia. 
- Bye.     
 - What? 
- "A," she's taken.     
 That's Asher's girlfriend. OK?     
 And, "B," those parties,     
 I'd steer clear.

 Hold up, y'all set me up?     
 - Last night I thought... 
- Thought what?     
 Thought that we were a team, friends?     
 The only reason you were even at that party     
 - is because we told Leila to get you there. 
- To what?     
 What, haze me?

 Then go back to Crenshaw.

 Say that again, bruh.     
 Come on, bruh. What? Say it again, bruh.     
 I will not let you blow this.     
 One fight, and you're done. Game over.     
 Cool it.     
 And you... you should know better than this.     
 Oh, do not put this on me, Dad.     
 You worked this whole thing up.     
 It was all a lie. Even the guy's permit to be at the school was a lie, a lie to save yourself.     
 Hey, yo, Spencer, you think he cares about you?     
 He's just trying to save his job, OK?     
 - That's... that's what matters. 
- Enough.     
 - Not you. 
- Jordan.     
 - You don't matter to... 
- Jordan, enough.     
 Enough.     
 Back to work.     
 Spencer.     
 Yo, man, I quit.     
 I'm done here.     
 Why, because I need your help to win a season?     
 - Look, winning is my job. 
- Then you should have said that from the start.     
 All that "here to give you a chance" talk, I didn't need it.     
 - And I don't belong here. 
- Look, yes, I need you to win games, but you need me more.     
 - Is that right? 
- This is your chance, Spencer.     
 This is your way out.     
 - Look, I'm trying to help you. 
- I didn't ask for your help or a way out.     
 Look, you might recall I wasn't the one knocking down Beverly's door.     
 You came, said you'd help me get to my dream.     
 And now that I get here, you change my position?     
 - How is that helping? 
- You can see the field, Spencer, in a way few players can.     
 Look, I made a promise, remember?     
 I said that I would help you get to the NFL.     
 But in order to do that, I need you to see the field from every angle, because when you do, you'll be unstoppable.     
 Look, I'm just getting to know you, OK, but I can see it plain as day.     
 You're looking for a fight.     
 And all your life, every bad decision you've ever made is because your father left you when you were a kid.     
 Listen to me.     
 But the path you take now, that's up to you.     
 COOP: You see these dudes?     
 - Yeah, they're great. 
- Nah, they used to be great.     
 Now they just stuck.     
 They didn't take their shot when they had it.     
 Well, I can't keep living with a foot in two worlds, Coop, feeling like I don't belong in either.     
 Then don't belong.     
 Take the best of both and you boss up.     
 I don't know if I can do it.     
 You can and you will.     
 - All right, so what about you? 
- What about me?     
 Shawn?     
 - Look, if I ain't here... 
- Listen, that dude is all talk.     
 I got that handled.     
 - Coop. 
- I promise you, he backed off.     
 Listen, Spence.     
 If I had a tenth of your talent, bro,     
 I'd say forget this place and bounce.     
 Who wouldn't?     
 Think about Dillon, your moms.     
 You could really get him a better life.     
 I'm not gonna let you throw that away.     
 And when you're living your best life, rocking it in that Super Bowl confetti, you gonna think of how your homie Coop set you straight, how somewhere she dying for a Ducati.     
 Stupid.

 Hey, honey.     
 There's someone here to see you.     
 What can I do for you, Spencer?     
 I want to play in the NFL.     
 I want a life better than the one I've been living.     
 Look, man, what drives me to play is my anger, all right?     
 That's what you see between those white lines.     
 And you were right about my dad.     
 I'm angry he left.     
 Angry 'cause I gotta fight for every damn step I take, angry my mama can't pay the bills.     
 Look, man, I gotta do better for her...     
 For Dillon.     
 And Beverly will help me do that, football or not, so...     
 I will play any position you tell me.     
 But before I do, I need to know why.     
 Why me, man?     
 Because I wanted to win, Spencer. I, uh...     
 I wanted to get back just a little bit of what I lost when I busted up my knee.     
 But then I saw you on the field, and you remind me of me.     
 Now, you say you play because you're angry.     
 I understand that.     
 But if we're gonna do this, I'm asking you to play for something bigger now.
