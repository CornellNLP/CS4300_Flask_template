 Previously on "All American"  
 I've been robbed. 
  Do you have anything to do with my security cameras being off? 
  So are we gonna ignore the obvious here on purpose? 
  Let's see, Spencer has been fighting with the gangs in his neighborhood. 
  You got me confused, bro. 
  I'll put your ass down like a dog and won't think twice. 
  OLIVIA: I know how I'd feel if this happened to me, so I figured you might need a little company. 
  If there's one thing I learned about you, Preach, it's loyalty. 
  The stronger the loyalty, the deeper the bond. 
  Tyrone had your family killed. 
  You mean to tell me you're cool with that? 
  We don't need your gifts around here, a'ight? 
  We good. 
  Your little brother might think differently. 
  He doesn't even know you're back, and it's probably best we keep it that way. 
  I wasn't completely honest as to why your father left. 
  I'm not proud of the way I ghosted on my family, but given the circumstances at that time, it felt like the only thing to do. 
  I'm so proud of you. 
  It don't matter. 
  Of course it matters. 
  You worked hard for that. 
  He wasn't there. 
  Why did he leave? 
  Did something happen? 
  Nothing happened. 
  Sometimes people grow apart. 
  But no matter what, we both love you very much. 
  You know that, right? 
  Yeah. 
  - Come here. 
  - [KISS] 
  Yay! 
  [CLEARS THROAT] 
  I know you're upset, so I've given you your space this week, but it's time we talk. 
  Why? 
  Everything out your mouth gonna be lies anyway. 
  You only get one of those. 
  Look, Spencer, what happened was a mistake. 
  It never should have happened and We both know that. 
  I'm so sorry, baby. 
  We were both in a really dark place at the time. 
  I was in a dark place when dad took off and you left me there. 
  All this time, you knew the reason he left and you never told me. 
  - Hold up. 
  - And you moved me into your home, pretended to feel bad about my missing father when you knew the truth, too. 
  DILLON: What's going on? 
  Why's coach Baker here? 
  He just Stopped by to drop off something for Spencer. 
  You still doing it. 
  Look, you deserve to know the truth, man. 
  Dad's back. 
  What? 
  [CROWD CHEERING] 
  MAN: Boy, you can't stop You know you want us to shine [WHISTLE BLOWS] 
  Get it all on the line ANNOUNCER: And another thrilling victory for the Beverly High Eagles. 
  - JORDAN: All right, whose house? 
  - PLAYERS: Our house! 
  - Whose house? 
  - Our house! 
  - Who's next? 
  - South Crenshaw! 
  Your old team, bro. 
  The best gift I could give y'all after a game like that is a short speech. 
  [PLAYERS CHATTERING] 
  You've given me everything all year, and I thank you for that. 
  I'm just asking for one more game. 
  If we beat South Crenshaw, we will be state champions. 
  Y'all heard? 
  - Yes, Sir! 
  - I said, "y'all heard?"  
  - Yes, Sir! 
  - Let's get it. 
  [PLAYERS CHEERING] 
  Look, we wouldn't have made it this far without you. 
  The team couldn't ask for a better captain, and, um, I couldn't ask for a better son, so I'm proud of you. 
  So much for your short speech, Dad. 
  You ever gonna tell your family the truth? 
  [CLEARS THROAT] 
  Look I'm sorry I hurt you. 
  I am, and if I could change everything, I would, but hasn't all this hurt enough people already? 
  It's been years, Spencer. 
  I mean, what would telling my family accomplish now except bringing them more pain? 
  It might be easy for you to live in that house and lie to your family, but I can't, a'ight? 
  So you got to tell them by the end of the weekend, or I will. 
  Hey. 
  Congrats on making it to state. 
  80 yards and a touchdown. 
  Not bad. 
  - 84 yards. 
  - Oh. 
  Excuse me. 
  Ha ha! 
  It would have been over a hundred, but Butler missed that block. 
  Oh, yeah. 
  I heard Leila's crashing at your place. 
  Guess hotel Baker isn't that full. 
  OK, get someone to Rob your house and I'll see what I can do, OK? 
  - How's she doing? 
  - She's OK. 
  I can't blame her for not wanting to be alone in that house, though. 
  Yeah. 
  Things any better at yours? 
  They're fine. 
  Guess never a dull moment at the Adams' motel. 
  HAROLD: There's my boy. 
  Almost a hundred yards receiving. 
  Stupid Butler. 
  Yeah, I know. 
  Heh! 
  Hey, I gotta go. 
  Maybe I should drive. 
  LEILA: Hey, they were really rough on you out there. 
  - Nothing I couldn't handle. 
  - OK. 
  I was gonna offer you a massage, but you're OK. 
  - Oh. 
  Oh, no, no, no. 
  - No, you look great. 
  No, you're right. 
  There's so much pain. 
  - Oh, it does hurt? 
  - Yeah. 
  COREY: Sorry to interrupt. 
  Just want to say congratulations. 
  Man, you played one hell of a game. 
  Thanks. 
  This is my girl, Leila. 
  Baby, this is, um Corey James. 
  Nice to meet you. 
  Nice to meet you, too. 
  I know it's last-minute, but I was thinking maybe I could take you to dinner. 
  It's not every day you make it to state championship. 
  You should come, too. 
  We got plans. 
  I meant what I said. 
  I want a relationship with you and Dillon. 
  Yeah. 
  Let's go, babe. 
  Nice to meet you. 
  You, too. 
  REGGIE: So Tamia comes in and says it's raining inside, and turns out that the pipes had burst in her room and it really it really was raining. 
  Ha ha ha. 
  That's not funny. 
  I could've drowned. 
  Oh, but lucky for us, you didn't. 
  [MOCKING] 
  I'm gonna get the check. 
  Uh-uh, you better not be reaching for that wallet. 
  Pay me back when you're a big-time NFL star. 
  All right, you got it. 
  Hey, it's good to see y'all two getting along again. 
  Yeah, man, everything is great. 
  Not everything. 
  Yo, why you got to bring that up? 
  You know what Preach is gonna do to Tyrone. 
  Shawn is dead because of Tyrone. 
  He deserve whatever gonna happen to him. 
  I know you don't believe that. 
  Look, you're not a killer, Coop, and offering up Tyrone is the same as pulling the trigger yourself. 
  PATIENCE: When all this started, I told you I'd make sure Coop stayed Coop. 
  And you ain't got to worry about that. 
  - Well, I am worried. 
  - How you gonna feel when you got Tyrone's blood on your hands, huh? 
  Kids, ready to go? 
  - Yes, sir. 
  - Yeah. 
  [DOOR CLOSES] 
  - What up, D? 
  - Where you been? 
  - With Coop. 
  - For real, for real, or you don't want me to know that you were with dad? 
  Look, man, I know you want to meet him, but I don't think it's a good idea. 
  - Why not? 
  - 'Cause I don't want you getting hurt when he leaves again. 
  How do you know he's going to? 
  How do you know he hasn't changed? 
  People like him don't change. 
  Why'd you even tell me he was here if you didn't want me to see him? 
  'Cause I didn't want to lie to you. 
  But you got to trust me, a'ight? 
  We're better off without him. 
  Why do you get to decide what I do? 
  You don't even live here anymore. 
  You're off with your other family in Beverly Hills while I'm stuck here alone. 
  [SCOFFS] 
  D. 
  CHRIS: Hey, you know what, y'all? 
  I'd actually like to make a toast to the Beverly Eagles. 
  Congratulations on doing something me and my boys never could Making it to the championship with my boy Spencer. 
  JORDAN: Hey, that's fine, all right? 
  Take Spence any day of the week. 
  CHRIS: You know what? 
  Y'all should actually come through to my crib tomorrow night. 
  My parents are out of town, so you know I'm throwing a party. 
  It could be one last celebration before we crush y'all dreams next week. 
  JJ: A party? 
  I'm on it. 
  He's on it. 
  [CELL PHONES CHIMING AND VIBRATING] 
  OK, how does he know my address? 
  LEILA: I think a party could be fun. 
  Yeah, we can all go together. 
  - Sounds fine. 
  - Fine? 
  Spence, you out of your mind, man. 
  You know my parties are lit. 
  Heh. 
  Yeah. 
  Spence, I'm not Hey, can I stay over again tonight? 
  Yeah. 
  Yeah, no, stay as long as you want. 
  Have you told Spencer how freaked out you are to go home? 
  Um, no. 
  He thinks I'm staying there 'cause I'm worried about him. 
  I'm gonna get a water. 
  You guys need anything? 
  - Mm-mmm. 
  - No. 
  Hey. 
  Hey. 
  Uh, pick-up for Asher. 
  Uh, can I get a water, please? 
  Thank you. 
  So, you joining us or No, take out. 
  I got to get home, try and get some food into my dad. 
  Yeah, I didn't want to say anything, but he seemed a little drunk at the game. 
  - Is he OK? 
  - Yeah, he's fine. 
  Look, he's always liked to drink. 
  It's just Gotten worse since my mom left. 
  He'll be fine if he can get back on his feet, though. 
  I mean, well, my mom keeps saying that she needs help with fundraising, I mean, and your dad has connections with the boosters. 
  I can see if she'll meet with him. 
  You don't need to keep saving me. 
  I'm good. 
  I'm not trying to save you. 
  I'm just offering to help your dad. 
  You sure? 
  Doesn't hurt to ask. 
  But, look, just don't get your hopes up, OK? 
  If he has a problem, there's no easy fix. 
  That's not a problem. 
  Thanks, Liv. 
  Thanks for coming. 
  Thanks for giving me a chance. 
  Dillon seems to think you deserve one. 
  I like Leila. 
  She seems nice. 
  - You barely met her. 
  - Oh, so she's not nice? 
  No, she is. 
  I just don't want to talk about her. 
  Spencer, I'm trying. 
  You said that Dillon wanted you to give me a chance. 
  Dillon doesn't remember having a dad, and then one day he's just gone. 
  No note, no good-bye, no nothing. 
  Looking at you now brings all that anger back, man. 
  I was angry for too long, and I don't want to be that way no more. 
  Hey no one said this is gonna happen overnight. 
  I just want to talk. 
  About what? 
  What, my first game? 
  My first date? 
  Dillon's first day of school? 
  It don't change the fact that you weren't there for any of it, man. 
  It don't change the fact that for 8 years you could not pick up the phone and call your kids. 
  Or did you try, and that's just another thing mom's lied to me about? 
  Go easy on your mom, man. 
  It takes two people to ruin a marriage, and I did more than my part. 
  I gave up my dream of playing in the NFL for your mother, and I never let her forget it. 
  I resented her, pushed her away. 
  When she finally gave me an excuse to leave, I took it. 
  So you're right to hate me, but don't take it out on your mother. 
  [CHUCKLES] 
  you know what? 
  My break's over. 
  I'm sorry I wasted your time. 
  PREACH: Shoot for 10, shoot for 10. 
  Let's go. 
  Ahh! 
  Money gone. 
  Give me that. 
  Give me all that. 
  Preach, I need to talk to you. 
  MAN: Second coming comes Hey, I'm still in it. 
  MAN: Did you fire 'em Look, so I'm thinking Tyrone might not have to die. 
  That's the code, Coop. 
  I thought you wanted justice for Shawn. 
  I do, but you already got two strikes against you. 
  You get busted, you're going back to jail for life. 
  Don't act like you care about me. 
  This is about the fact that you ain't down with your role in all this. 
  It's a different beast when you set it in motion. 
  That's why this life ain't never been for you, Coop. 
  Look, there's other ways to get rid of Tyrone. 
  We could run him out of town, let him know he ain't welcome in Crenshaw no more. 
  And you think he'd go, just like that? 
  He would if he knew his only options was that or death. 
  Come on, it's worth a try, right? 
  Come on, I need more than a head nod, Preach. 
  Look, you're right. 
  The last thing I need is my third strike. 
  Hey, y'all, I'm back in. 
  - LEILA: Hey. 
  - SPENCER: Hey. 
  How'd things go with your dad? 
  About as I expected. 
  Any chance you wanted it to go that way? 
  Heh. 
  Probably. 
  You know what? 
  Forget it. 
  Who who needs a father anyway? 
  You and I turned out OK. 
  Nah, you turned out better than OK. 
  At least you still have an amazing mother. 
  What? 
  Hey, what is it? 
  Spencer, you're my boyfriend. 
  If something is bothering you, I want to know about it. 
  Besides, it's Grace. 
  How bad can it be? 
  My mom cheated on my dad with coach Baker. 
  That's why he left. 
  [LAUGHTER WITHIN] 
  LAURA: Babe, glad you're home. 
  Look who came to see you. 
  Great. 
  Well, I'll leave you boys alone. 
  Corey, it was really good to see you. 
  Play nice. 
  - Mm-hmm. 
  - He misses his son. 
  Always liked Laura. 
  Why are you in my house? 
  I'm worried about Spencer. 
  He's a resilient kid. 
  There's no need to start worrying about him now. 
  Are we done here? 
  I'm guessing Laura don't know the truth. 
  Is that a threat? 
  I'm not here to ruin anyone's life. 
  I wasn't even gonna tell Spencer about the affair. 
  I'm surprised you did. 
  Well, that was Grace. 
  She thought it was the right thing to do. 
  She didn't want him hearing it from you. 
  She was always a smart woman. 
  [SIGHS] 
  Look, I know you think I blame you for everything that happened, and for a while, I did. 
  But eventually, you have to take ownership of your mistakes and hope your family forgives you. 
  That's what Grace did. 
  That's what I'm trying to do now. 
  Maybe you should do the same. 
  [DOOR OPENS AND CLOSES] 
  WOMAN: The poll numbers aren't great. 
  You're not coming across as relatable. 
  Voters see you as just another rich Beverly Hills woman. 
  I'm relatable. 
  How how am I not relatable? 
  'Course you're relatable, baby. 
  You're strong, smart, successful. 
  Right. 
  Strong, smart, successful, rich Beverly Hills woman. 
  Not helping, Olivia. 
  Luckily, I have the solution your family. 
  They're the perfect image for your campaign. 
  They're charming, attractive. 
  Diverse. 
  That doesn't hurt. 
  Go back to the attractive part real quick. 
  I'm just not sure I'm comfortable using my family like that. 
  Why not? 
  We're stuffing envelopes. 
  If it'll help you win, I'm in. 
  I'll set up the photo shoot this weekend. 
  Photo shoot? 
  Do you think Spencer would be willing to join? 
  He's like family, right? 
  Yeah, and he's from Crenshaw. 
  That doesn't hurt. 
  - That's a good idea, yeah. 
  - Yeah, maybe we can get - Who is she? 
  - Who is ha ha! 
  [INDISTINCT CHATTER] 
  GRACE: Is your plan to avoid me forever? 
  Because if not, I really would like the chance to talk to my son again. 
  [KISS] 
  You got to believe that you and your little brother are my world, that the last thing I would want to do is to hurt you. 
  Then you shouldn't have lied to me. 
  You were such a beautiful, happy boy. 
  When Corey left, I remember looking into your eyes, and I couldn't bring myself to break your heart no more than what it already was. 
  And then when he never came back, I didn't want you to hate the only parent you had left. 
  And as time went on, I just I thought it was best to leave the pain buried in the past. 
  Only you didn't. 
  It stayed with me, every day when I wondered if I was the reason he left. 
  I kept thinking maybe there was something I could have done to keep him here. 
  I told you it wasn't your fault. 
  You also said you didn't know. 
  And then you let me move in with coach Baker when he was the reason he left. 
  Billy wasn't the reason Corey left. 
  Corey and I was the reason, but I knew that you wouldn't see it that way. 
  You wouldn't have moved if you knew the truth. 
  And I just wanted you to have a chance at a better future. 
  But that should have been my decision to make. 
  Maybe you're right. 
  But as a parent, sometimes you have to make tough decisions, and it might not always be the right ones. 
  Did you go see him again? 
  I just needed to talk to him. 
  That's all I wanted to do. 
  What did you talk about? 
  Did he say why he left? 
  He, um [SIGHS] 
  It was like mom said. 
  They just grew apart, so he had to leave. 
  But it had nothing to do with us. 
  A'ight? 
  I promise. 
  Ooh! 
  Girl. 
  Yeah. 
  [LAUGHS] 
  Oh, my god. 
  Seeing that dude looking at you? 
  What? 
  What if he was looking at you? 
  Then he had two lazy eyes because they was both pointed in your direction. 
  Shut up. 
  You can have him. 
  Great. 
  Yo, Coop. 
  You rolling tonight? 
  Rolling where? 
  Give me a second. 
  Yeah. 
  What's up? 
  I'm getting payback for Shawn. 
  Figured since you two were close, you'd want in. 
  That ain't happening no more. 
  You didn't talk to Preach? 
  Yeah, he's the one picking us up. 
  All right. 
  Well, yeah, I I guess I'll see you tonight. 
  All right. 
  For sure. 
  Is everything OK? 
  No, it's not OK. 
  They're still going after Tyrone, man. 
  I got to get to him before they do. 
  Thanks for meeting me. 
  I wanted to meet with you, too. 
  Did you love my mom? 
  Or just hate my dad? 
  Uh, wow. 
  Spencer, it wasn't It wasn't like that. 
  Sometimes in life, things get messy. 
  Yeah, I know. 
  I'm part of the mess y'all two never cleaned up. 
  No, we didn't. 
  You know, Dillon asked me this morning why pops left. 
  And I couldn't tell him. 
  Just didn't feel right. 
  And then I realized it wasn't my place. 
  I ain't gonna tell your family, man So if you think it's better for them not to know, that's your call. 
  I'm gonna tell Laura today. 
  What made you change your mind? 
  To be honest, your father. 
  What, he threaten to tell them? 
  No, no The exact opposite. 
  He reminded me that you can't start the healing process until you're man enough to own your mistakes. 
  TV ANNOUNCER: We saw 3 cars crashing during qualifying yesterday. 
  Had to pull out those back-up cars and head to the back of the pack. 
  I think the drivers are still getting used to the drag Olivia Baker called. 
  She said you didn't show up for your interview. 
  Yeah, I gave it some thought. 
  I'm not gonna even vote for Laura Baker. 
  Why would I work for her? 
  Job's beneath me. 
  And lying around getting drunk isn't? 
  [RAISES VOLUME] 
  Hey! 
  [-TURNS OFF TV] 
  What is it with you? 
  Are you so scared of failing you won't even try? 
  I'm not the loser who had to grovel to stay on the football team. 
  You know, you're not the only one that lost everything. 
  I did, too. 
  The difference is I'm still trying and you've given up. 
  You finished? 
  You don't want a loser for a son? 
  Well, guess what, I don't want a loser for a father. 
  So do whatever you want to do. 
  I'm done caring about you. 
  - Hey, babe. 
  - Hey. 
  Do you think that I should end my speech with "thank you," or is that not relatable enough? 
  Um - "Peace out," maybe? 
  - [CHUCKLES] 
  It was a joke Apparently not a very funny one. 
  There's something I need to tell you, baby. 
  OK. 
  Is everything OK? 
  Um Hey Whatever it is, we'll We'll tackle it head on like we always do. 
  I had an affair with Grace James. 
  [SIGHS] 
 
 
 
  it was a long time ago, and it was right after I blew out my knee and my career was over. 
  And I was depressed and I was angry, and one night you and I just got into a huge fight, and I found myself in Crenshaw and All of a sudden, I was in my own neighbor My old neighborhood with my old girlfriend, and I felt like my old self, a football star that everybody used to cheer for, and I'm sorry. 
  I'm so sorry. 
  It it only happened one time. 
  I'm sorry I I didn't tell you sooner. 
  And I know this is a lot, but I realized that, um, the only way I could fix this the only way I could fix this was if I I was completely honest with you. 
  You're such a coward You know that? 
  The only reason you're telling me this now is because Corey's back and because My campaign is digging up the past. 
  And you know what? 
  Screw the campaign, because our perfect family ended the day that you betrayed us. 
  And you moved her son into our house. 
  I have I have not been with Grace since. 
  I promise. 
  I promise. 
  Up until today, that might have meant something. 
  Laura, please. 
  Wait. 
  Laura. 
  You know what? 
  The worst part is not even that you had an affair. 
  It's that you had to go to Grace James to feel whole again. 
  Not your wife And the mother of your children. 
  [SOBS] 
  God! 
  Up until a minute ago, I loved you more than anything in the world. 
  I I don't know I'm gonna fix this. 
  I can fix this. 
  I don't know how - [SOBS] 
  - but I can I can talk to the kids. 
  You know what? 
  You have done more than enough. 
  I'll talk to our kids. 
  MAN: You can try to run away But you know the ghosts will stay and OLIVIA, LAUGHING: Why? 
  [INDISTINCT CHATTER] 
  So come in and close the door I don't know. 
  I thought that I thought that Mom, you OK? 
  [SNIFFLING] 
  No, I'm not OK. 
  Sit down. 
  I have something I need to tell you. 
  [DISTANT THUNDER] 
  Hey, Coop, hold up. 
  Let me guess. 
  Patience called. 
  Yo, remind me to delete your number out her phone. 
  She's just worried about you, a'ight? 
  We both are. 
  Spence, I'm not dumb. 
  Tyrone is meeting me in a public place with lots of people. 
  Yeah, well, now you got one more. 
  So what's the plan? 
  [SIGHS] 
  TYRONE: Leave town? 
  What makes you think I'm just gonna pick up and leave? 
  COOP: You got no choice. 
  You're not welcome here in Crenshaw no more. 
  - That's a bold statement, little girl. 
  - Hey. 
  Hope you packing something stronger than Spencer. 
  Look, you ain't got to step to Coop, all right? 
  She the only friend you got right now, and she giving you a chance to save yourself. 
  Giving me a chance? 
  Oh, it's like that. 
  Yo, everybody know what you did to Shawn, and they're coming for you. 
  Is that right? 
  Who's coming for me, exactly? 
  Your own bloods. 
  COOP: Might even be your homeboys over there. 
  And it's going down soon, so the way I see it, either you leave town or you end up like Shawn. 
  What's stopping me from putting y'all down right here? 
  Come on, man, even you ain't that crazy. 
  Look, Tyrone, this ain't your 'hood no more, and those ain't your people. 
  I'm just trying to give you something you didn't give Shawn, and that's a way out. 
  - Why would you do that? 
  - 'Cause I don't want anybody to die if they don't have to. 
  I knew you were soft, Coop. 
  Compassion don't make me soft. 
  It's over, Ty. 
  Guess y'all leave me no choice. 
  [ALL CHEERING] 
  Feeling it up in here, baby. 
  You're feeling it up in here, baby.

  Just to be in your thoughts And I ain't gonna do it 'cause you said I can No. 
  Um, can I have my beer back? 
  Look, I can't have two people in my life going down the same hole on the same day. 
  - What does that mean? 
  - It doesn't matter what are you doing? 
  - I'm enjoying myself. 
  - You mean throwing away your sobriety. 
  It's the same thing. 
  Why don't we try to do something different this time? 
  I I'm here. 
  I can listen no. 
  Fine, I'll just pour myself another one. 
  Then I will take that one as well. 
  It's one beer, Asher. 
  Who cares? 
  - I care. 
  - Stop. 
  Hey, Liv. 
  Hey, where you been? 
  I've been looking for you all night. 
  You all right? 
  Come here. 
  Yeah, I'm great. 
  Hey, man, can you give us a minute? 
  Uh, actually, hey, we're kind of in the middle of something. 
  Well, why do you think I interrupted? 
  She wasn't happy with whatever you were in the middle of, so I think you should give us that minute. 
  Are you really trying to start something? 
  Look, Olivia's having a rough night. 
  I'm just trying to help. 
  I don't need advice on how to take care of Hey, enough. 
  I can handle myself, all right? 
  - Liv - Don't need anyone's help. 
  Bro, what's up? 
  You good? 
  - What up? 
  - Yeah. 
  I imagined my pops coming back for years, what it would be like. 
  I never pictured this. 
  Dude's been back in town less than a month, and everybody's already worse off. 
  Uh, when I said, "is you good?" I meant, "you want another drink?" Ha ha ha! 
  But we can do this, too. 
  We can do this. 
  You know Dillon wants to see him? 
  Yeah. 
  How can I let that happen, Coop? 
  He abandoned us. 
  If he really wanted to be a part of our lives, why'd it take him so long to come back? 
  I don't know, man. 
  Maybe the same thing that kept your moms from telling you the truth for so long, and the thing that kept me from coming out to my parents. 
  And what's that? 
  Shame. 
  I mean, it's hard to disappoint the people you love. 
  I wasn't ashamed of being gay, I was worried about losing the people I was closest to. 
  It took a lot for me to come out. 
  Yeah, I know. 
  This ain't the same thing. 
  Yes, it is. 
  He got to be ashamed of what he did. 
  That's why he trying so hard now. 
  Look, it just took him a hell of a long time to get the courage to face you. 
  Well, it's too late. 
  Yeah, it might be for you, but is it for Dillon? 
  Now think about it. 
  [INDISTINCT CHATTER] 
  Hey, yo, watch the kicks, daddy's boy. 
  Say that again. 
  Which part? 
  The part about you scuffing my shoes, or the part about you being QB1 just 'cause your daddy's the coach? 
  - Hey! 
  Hey! 
  Hey! 
  - [ALL SHOUTING] 
  No, no, no. 
  Let him go, man. 
  Everybody know he got a weak arm. 
  Yo, chill, man. 
  - JORDAN: Get off me! 
  - CHRIS: You know what? 
  It's time for you Beverly Hills boys to go back to where you belong, all right? 
  Yo, party's over! 
  The party's over! 
  It sucks when somebody crashes your world and ruins everything, doesn't it? 
  Get off me. 
  [INDISTINCT CHATTER] 
  - Hey. 
  - Hey. 
  Uh, you want to grab some food, drown our sorrows in a milkshake and pretend this night never happened? 
  I would, but I should probably get home, mend things with my mom. 
  OK. 
  - And you gonna be OK? 
  - Yeah, of course. 
  I'll see you tomorrow. 
  All right. 
  Hey. 
  How was your night? 
  Tiring. 
  I get why you lied. 
  Sometimes the truth just hurts too much, no matter what age you are. 
  You OK, baby? 
  Everything's gonna be different now, ain't it? 
  Nothing we can't handle. 
  I'm sorry for how I've been acting, ma. 
  I never thought about what dad coming back could mean for you and Dillon. 
  You don't have to worry about me, baby. 
  No, I do, though, and I get it if you don't want dad back in your life, but Dillon wants to meet him. 
  And I think he deserves a chance to have a father.
