 SPENCER: Previously on "All American" Spencer James? 
  Billy Baker, varsity coach, Beverly High. 
  I'll cut to the chase, Spencer. 
  I need you to come play for me. 
  We can offer you something that Crenshaw can't A better education in a safer school. 
  I can get you a way out. 
  GRACE: You think I didn't hear about that shooting over at Crenshaw the other night, that I didn't get a call about your little fight? 
  You've been in and out of trouble at that school for years. 
  COOP: Think about Dillon, your moms. 
  You could really get them a better life. 
  SPENCER: So you're rolling with gangbangers now. 
  I got it handled. 
  No, you got it twisted is what you got. 
  DILLON: Where you going? 
  To make sure Shawn leaves you the hell alone. 
  You said you had it handled. 
  I thought I did. 
  I want to make sure that you and I are on the same page. 
  There is no "you and I. " It was one drug-induced screw-up. 
  We got caught up in the moment, and I had to walk away from my best friend because of it. 
  Look, I can play both ways, coach, offense and defense. 
  You are burning it at both ends off the field. 
  I can't have you doing it on the field as well. 
  JORDAN: Something's not right. 
  I think he's hurting. 
  Just hit your receivers. 
  Don't worry about me, I'm hitting everyone who knows the playbook. 
  ["BORN FOR THIS" BY 7KINGZ PLAYING] 
  Something's coming something's coming something's coming - Dashes, let's go. 
  - [BLOWS WHISTLE] 
  Ooh Stop dragging. 
  You're only making it worse for yourself. 
  We will continue to do these two-a-days until you show me that you can work together as a team. 
  [GRUNTS] 
  I'm not feeling it yet. 
  - Let's go. 
  - [BLOWS WHISTLE] 
  Switch it up. 
  Dude, chill. 
  My dad always rides us hard after we lose a game. 
  You know that. 
  Yeah, we didn't lose that game. 
  He did. 
  Look, I haven't had a good night's sleep all week because homeboy here can't hold onto the damn ball. 
  He's not the only one who made a bad call last week. 
  Listen up, guys, we win as a team and we lose as Yeah, we know, OK? 
  We know. 
  It doesn't feel like much of a team right now, and it's all thanks to a guy who isn't even one of us. 
  CONGREGATION: This little light of mine I'm gonna let it shine this little light of mine I'm gonna let it shine this little light of mine I'm gonna let it shine let it shine, let it shine, let it shine All right, that was pretty good. 
  Y'all ain't gonna embarrass me on Sunday. 
  [LAUGHTER] 
  Get on out of here. 
  - Bye. 
  - Go on. 
  - Bye. 
  - Bye. 
  Thank you. 
  'Sup, mom? 
  Hey, baby. 
  How are you? 
  I'm all right. 
  Give me some sugar. 
  What time you and dad plan on heading to the retreat? 
  Why, you trying to have a house party or something? 
  I was at least gonna give it an hour. 
  Don't you break my good stuff. 
  Never. 
  We'll be gone after you get out of school. 
  - All right. 
  - Come on. 
  Speaking of which, don't be late. 
  - Love you. 
  - Bye. 
  - Don't have too much fun. 
  - Mm-hmm. 
  Tamia. 
  No boys at the house after we're gone. 
  At least make sure we don't hear about it. 
  OK. 
  [INDISTINCT CHATTER] 
  Oh, yeah, there he is, right there. 
  [LAUGHTER] 
  [LAUGHTER] 
  Hey, man, what's up? 
  You mind if I see your phone? 
  Um, this phone? 
  Yeah. 
  I didn't create them, I swear. 
  It just popped up in my group chat, then other people started forwarding it. 
  You know how things go viral. 
  [LAUGHTER] 
  He just dropped it. 
  Spencer, Spencer, Spencer, Spencer. 
  Whoa. 
  one fight, Principal Landon kicks you out. 
  Come on, you know that. 
  So I ain't supposed to stand up for myself? 
  Asher and his boys been talking smack and pulling crap like this all week, and I'm just supposed to keep turning the other cheek, huh? 
  No, they're just being them. 
  OK, they do this to everyone when they mess up a play, even me. 
  It's not personal. 
  Not personal? 
  They made a meme out of me fumbling a 40. 
  But, yeah, that's not personal. 
  I guess you would see it that way. 
  That's your people. 
  Spence, come on. 
  [CHEERING] 
  - 44! 
  - [BLOWS WHISTLE] 
  [HIP-HOP MUSIC PLAYING]

  - 7. 
  - [BLOWS WHISTLE] 
  All right. 
  Hey, hey! 
  Ash, get off the field! 
  Get off my field! 
  I didn't call your number! 
  You crossed the line. 
  Come on, you know better. 
  - Are you serious? 
  - BAKER: Hey, hey! 
  What, for him? 
  Hey, enough, enough. 
  [WHISTLE BLOWING] 
  BAKER: You're supposed to be a team, a family! 
  Right now you are nothing more than an embarrassment. 
  Y'all feel like giving up this season? 
  Y'all ready for that? 
  I'm not. 
  And I refuse to let you give up on your futures. 
  Figure it out fast, 'cause if y'all ain't bonded like glue by Monday, this last week of two-a-days is gonna feel like a damn vacation. 
  Disgusted. 
  [INDISTINCT CHATTER] 
  Coach is right. 
  This isn't who we are. 
  Tomorrow, mandatory meeting, 8:00 A. M. 
  , zoomer trip, OK? 
  You guys know the deal. 
  We'll work out together, we'll talk this crap out together, and when the sun sets, we'll come back together. 
  BOY: Let's do it. 
  Hey, where you going? 
  Man, I got a bus to catch. 
  It's Friday. 
  I'm going back to Crenshaw. 
  I'll be back Monday. 
  JORDAN: Hey, hey, hold up. 
  Hey, you're really blowing this off? 
  You're really not gonna show up for your team? 
  Man, I've been showing up, every game, every practice, every team beach day. 
  What more do you want from me, dawg? 
  I want you to want to be here, to want to be a part of this team. 
  That's more than just games and practices. 
  Man, I just fought my best friend for you. 
  I didn't ask you to defend me. 
  I didn't ask for none of this. 
  The weekends are the only time I get to see my family. 
  You know this better than anyone. 
  So y'all can do your team whatever without me. 
  After all, I ain't even one of you, right? 
  ["RUN FOR YOUR LIFE" BY THE SIEGE PLAYING] 
  Yeah I ain't trying to bring you down but for real, you might as well give up now my life been good and bad and all around the more things I lost, the more I found one thing I taught myself to do no matter the problem, refuse to lose, so run for your life run for your life run for your life So how awesome is this? 
  Kind of like old times, right? 
  Yeah. 
  So why exactly did Ms. 
  Bench put us together for the English project? 
  Beats me. 
  When I tried talking to her about it, she just said partner assignments are final. 
  Lucky us. 
  Hey, let's try and make the best of it. 
  I mean, I know it's homework, but who knows, might be fun. 
  [INDISTINCT CHATTER] 
  Why is this so hard? 
  It's one simple question Who was Shakespeare? 
  I mean, seriously, there's, like, a hundred conspiracy theories about who this guy really was. 
  Well, name aside, who he was comes through in his work, which is why I'm trying to focus on that, so Look, I know I ASHER: What's up, ladies? 
  Hey, babe. 
  Uh, what are you guys doing here? 
  JJ and I are also working on the English thing, so I figured 4 brains are better than two. 
  JJ: Uh, make that 3 brains. 
  This Shakespeare dude's not really my thing. 
  But, hey, food's on me. 
  [WHISTLE BLOWS] 
  COOP: So what, y'all never made fun of each other when y'all messed up here? 
  It ain't just the whack memes or the hazing. 
  They don't accept me. 
  I mean, man, acceptance go both ways, though. 
  You got to be honest. 
  Ain't like you been all open arms. 
  Yeah, OK, Iyanla. 
  [SCOFFS] 
  Man, shut up. 
  You know the fact you lecture me on honesty and acceptance is hilarious, right? 
  What are you trying to say? 
  You finally been honest with your parents and told them you gay? 
  I mean, listen, have they not met me? 
  How can I be anything else? 
  Seriously, I'm not responsible for their blindness. 
  But nice try, though, bro. 
  We ain't done talking about you. 
  Man, were you always this talkative? 
  All I'm saying is, man, physically, you with Beverly, but in your heart, you're with a whole 'nother team. 
  You think the rich boys don't realize you still rocking your South Crenshaw football ring? 
  Seriously, man. 
  And if Iyanla was here, she'd probably tell you, "child, listen. 
  " Don't you dare. 
  "Can't be accepted on one team till you let go of the other. 
  " Man, I just came to see some old friends, OK? 
  Mm-hmm. 
  and peep your new replacement. 
  Yeah, maybe that, too. 
  Yeah, I know that, too. 
  You ain't slick. 
  - I'm slicker than you. 
  - Yeah, all right. 
  You saw that, right? 
  Hey, boo. 
  Man, look who back slumming it in the 'hood. 
  Hey, what up, fellas? 
  Y'all miss me? 
  What's up, boy? 
  - How you doing? 
  - Chillin', chillin'. 
  Hey, you still coming to my mama's cookout later? 
  She still making her famous Mac and cheese? 
  - Only right. 
  - Then hell, yeah. 
  Hey, y'all called up Cameron Wilson to replace me, huh? 
  Hey, at least brother's willing to rock a South Crenshaw Jersey. 
  Oh, it's like that? 
  It's like that, dawg. 
  All right. 
  OK. 
  OK. 
  I'll check you at the cookout, though. 
  - I bet. 
  - [WHISTLE BLOWS] 
  All right, I'm ready to clean out the system and then hit round two. 
  Who wants more food? 
  You know, you don't need to announce every time you need to drop a deuce. 
  Why don't I get the food and you go take care of that? 
  Does anyone want anything? 
  No, I'm good. 
  Yeah, I'll get a drink. 
  A peach and ginger iced tea with two splashes of soda water. 
  Of course I remember your go-to. 
  Why would I forget? 
  I know what you're doing. 
  Trying not to fail English? 
  This isn't funny. 
  I already agreed to keep our stupid hookup a secret. 
  OK, your perfect boyfriend cover stays intact. 
  Happy? 
  This isn't about covering my ass. 
  It's about not destroying the lives of the 3 people I care about the most. 
  Leila would be devastated, and Jordan would hate me for involving you. 
  And let me guess, third person's you. 
  Actually, it's you. 
  I'm serious. 
  You had a rough ride last year, and you're kind of really turning things around. 
  I don't want to mess that up for you. 
  SPENCER: You got to be kidding me. 
  Who is this El debarge-looking dude? 
  Jordan, what you doing here, man? 
  There they are. 
  Look like he bastardizing them poor greens is what it look like. 
  You never been in a kitchen before? 
  Jordan was sweet enough to help me out while he waited on you. 
  DILLON: I don't know that "help" would be the word I would use. 
  OK, everybody's got jokes today, huh? 
  - [LAUGHTER] 
  - Why are you here? 
  To talk about the team. 
  No, man, now is not a good time. 
  Look, we don't stand a chance this season unless we all work together. 
  Or do you not care about winning anymore? 
  Look, I'll play, I'll practice, and I'll damn sure do my part on the field. 
  - But nothing more? 
  - I came to Beverly to play football, not force myself into fake friendships with folks who want nothing to do with me. 
  Fake friendships? 
  I welcomed you into my home. 
  All right, look, no shade. 
  You cool. 
  But if we're being honest, you don't know nothing about me, dawg, or where I'm from. 
  You know what? 
  I'm here now. 
  Let's fix that. 
  Nah, nah. 
  Look, I got plans, I got friends coming over. 
  I know, yeah, your mom already said I could stay for the cookout. 
  And you know, Spence, I can't think of a better way to really get to know you and Crenshaw. 
  - Hey, Jordan. 
  - Can you? 
  Jordan. 
  Jordan, I ain't playing. 
  Jordan. 
  You want to tell me what's going on? 
  It's gonna be one long-ass day. 
  ["LIVING THE DREAM" BY TONY REDZ AND MR.

  Oh, we're doing a symbolic portrait of William Shakespeare, so using paint, collage, quotations and stuff to dissect his real identity. 
  Wow. 
  OK. 
  Ha. 
  Back in my day, we just used to write papers, but, uh, have you seen the movie "Anonymous"? 
  The Shakespeare fraud movie? 
  - That's the one.

  Uh, you know, you two have always loved a good movie day. 
  I'll make the popcorn. 
  Cool.

  No, my contacts are dry. 
  Right. 
  just like it was your contacts when we saw "Black Panther," "Step Up", "Step Up 2," "Coco". 
  No, you cried at "Coco", too. 
  [LAUGHS] 
  Hey, um, remember last fall at angel's point? 
  Actually, last year's kind of a blur for me. 
  No, you remember. 
  - No, not really. 
  - At the park You know, we should really get back to the English project. 
  Seriously? 
  So I don't remember every little thing. 
  I was high a lot back then, OK? 
  I'm kind of trying not to remember all the crazy crap I did. 
  Um, wow. 
  Uh, I should go. 
  Why? 
  This was a mistake. 
  I should have never asked Ms. 
  Bench to put us together. 
  Yes, it was me. 
  I just thought maybe if we spent some time together that Anyway, it doesn't matter what I thought. 
  I do not want to force anyone into my life who doesn't want to be there. 
  I'll just I'll finish this on my own.

  He ain't saying nothing really that deep. 
  All right, so who get the number-one spot Biggie or Pac? 
  Cameron: Biggie, easy. 
  Man, you on the wrong coast, dawg. 
  Straight up, man. 
  Pac was an activist, a poet. 
  He wasn't a better rapper. 
  Who had a better flow? 
  Rakim. 
  Hands down. 
  He was a lyrical genius, crazy mic techniques, the original smooth flow. 
  Come on, guys.

  Yo, man, if you got something to say, just say it. 
  You ain't got no business wearing that Crenshaw ring no more. 
  You don't belong here. 
  Since you felt like you had to leave us to succeed, you should have just stayed gone. 
  We got an upgrade anyway. 
  Ain't that right, Cam? 
  You know, honestly, I doubt Cam could even touch Spencer on the field. 
  Pretty sure we got the upgrade. 
  CHRIS: Well, uh, we'll see you in the playoffs. 
  Oh, wait, that's right. 
  Beverly Hills ain't been to the playoffs in years. 
  Oh, they will this year.

  If you don't want people knowing where you are, maybe stop insta-storying your avocado toast. 
  Then why aren't you So I could start by listing a hundred reasons why I've been so caught up in my own drama, or we can just jump right to the part where I'm an idiot. 
  It took me a minute to remember this weekend's the second anniversary of your mom's passing. 
  I'm really sorry. 
  I feel terrible. 
  And of course I remember us commemorating her at elevation park. 
  And I'm really glad you remembered, but I don't need your pity. 
  I'm fine, so you're off the hook. 
  Let my tired mind wander free So why haven't I seen you with any girls in school before? 
  Because I've never felt the need to put my business out there, that's why. 
  OK. 
  OK, so when's the first time you said the words, "I'm gay," like out loud? 
  I never had to say it. 
  I just am. 
  You never said the words? 
  No, it's just a word. 
  I mean, it's obvious li like girls. 
  I'm not hiding from it. 
  I'm not trying to hide it. 
  [CHUCKLES] 
  I mean, I like you. 
  Yeah? 
  Yeah. 
  I don't know, something tells me you're full of surprises, though. 
  [CHUCKLES] 
  What, you got plans or down to hang? 
  I mean, it's cool. 
  You can come inside, chill, kick it. 
  Whatever. 
  Yeah. 
  yeah, I'm definitely down to hang. 
  Or whatever. 
  Ha ha ha ha! 
  Ahh, ahh Listen, man, I know things got a little intense back there, but on the plus side, your team showed up for you. 
  Even with all of our internal BS, they showed up. 
  That has to feel good. 
  They showed up for you and to stick it to South Crenshaw. 
  Isn't that what you were doing? 
  Only because you put us in that situation. 
  We should have never played that game. 
  Now my old teammates won't even talk to me. 
  Why you have to come here, man? 
  So let me get this straight. 
  I showed up in your world and blew everything up? 
  Sounds familiar, doesn't it? 
  [SIREN BLEATS] 
  What the hell? 
  [POLICE RADIO CHATTER] 
  Is there a problem, Officer? 
  License and registration, please? 
  Why? 
  I wasn't speeding or anything. 
  You made an illegal turn at a red light. 
  License and registration. 
  What? 
  how far back? 
  What turn? 
  What are you doing, man? 
  Just give him what he asked for. 
  What are you boys doing in this neighborhood? 
  Are you serious right now? 
  We've done nothing wrong, man. 
  Jordan. 
  This is harassment. 
  OK, my mom is a lawyer. 
  Step out of the car, please. 
  What? 
  I need you to stop resisting and get out of the car now. 
  OK. 
  I know my rights, OK? 
  Stand to the side, please. 
  JORDAN: I cannot believe this. 
  You just wait until my mom gets a load of you, big man. 
  I'm gonna call my mom OFFICER: You do what I tell you to do. 
  I don't give a damn who your mom is. 
  SPENCER: Officer, Sir. 
  Officer. 
  OFFICER: Get out of the car. 
  I'm showing you my hands, all right? 
  I'm unarmed. 
  Hey, look, restraining him ain't necessary, OK? 
  We're cooperating. 
  Hey, chill. 
  Chill, man. 
  Stop resisting. 
  Didn't I arrest you once? 
  [HANDCUFFS CLICK] 
  Hey, just keep looking at me, all right? 
  Just keep looking at me. 
  I have Officer Trishell's badge number already. 
  I want to speak to his Supervising Officer. 
  Well, he can talk to me now or he can face me in the morning when I file a lawsuit against his entire department. 
  Are you guys OK? 
  JORDAN: How could you not go off on that cop? 
  Why didn't you have my back? 
  I had your back. 
  I got you home. 
  Why would you even argue with a cop in the first place? 
  Why would you put yourself in that kind of danger? 
  I did what I was taught. 
  I was standing up for myself, OK, dad? 
  I'll check on him. 
  Yo, can I ask you something? 
  Mm-hmm. 
  Why you ain't never talked to Jordan about dealing with the police? 
  By the time I was 8, my moms made it clear. 
  Cops like that, they see my blackness as a weapon, you know, so you talk slow, you do as they ask, you keep your hands visible, and you never run. 
  How come you ain't tell him that? 
  I guess I thought I had time. 
  I fought so hard to get up out the 'hood. 
  I honestly thought that with all this I honestly thought that I had bought Jordan just a little bit more time before He had to face the The ugly side of being a black man in America. 
  Can't nobody shelter his son from it. 
  Mm-mmm. 
  [KEYBOARD PLAYING] 
  [INSECTS CHIRPING] 
  Um, why are you wasting your time in these messy-ass hallways of South Crenshaw when you could be, I don't know, giving Drake a run for his money? 
  It's whatever. 
  I don't know. 
  Are you blushing? 
  What, is the Tamia Cooper blushing right now? 
  You trippin', girl. 
  You know black people don't blush. 
  So, just because you can't see it doesn't mean it's not happening. 
  Mm-hmm. 
  Definitely warm. 
  Definitely blushing. 
  CLASSIK: Are you mine? 
  'Cause I don't want to waste no time I can't deny I'll show you love but it seems to me that you don't mind after all this time So are you gonna play me another song? 
  But it seems to me that you don't mind Hell, yeah. 
  I am yours Lead the way like martians let's change the game I am yours through rain and snow [DOOR CLOSES] 
  [WHISPERING] 
  Patience, come on. 
  You got to get up. 
  Wake up. 
  OK, just give me one second. 
  No, you don't have a second. 
  Oh, hey, Patience. 
  Hi. 
  Maybe you should get home before your mom gets worried. 
  Yes, ma'am. 
  Good morning, Tamia. 
  Breakfast in 10. 
  OK. 
  [LAUGHS] 
  So you want to tell me why you had me call everyone here? 
  Look, man, I'm sorry about yesterday. 
  It's kind of messed up it took being face down with you in the concrete to realize We ain't all that different. 
  And I probably would have realized that sooner if I hadn't been pushing y'all away. 
  ASHER: What's with the impromptu meet-up? 
  Spencer's got something to say. 
  Hey, thank y'all for showing up. 
  And I don't mean just this morning, I mean yesterday, too. 
  Hey, yo, my last team, we were like a family, and I just assumed y'all weren't driven by that same bond, and that's my bad. 
  But y'all turning up for me yesterday showed me what kind of team y'all really are, and I want in on that. 
  Crenshaw will always be a part of who I am, but being a Beverly Eagle, that's a part of who I'm becoming. 
  And look, man, I know I lost last week's game. 
  No, you didn't. 
  I threw interception third quarter. 
  You didn't lose that game alone. 
  Missed tackle, second quarter. 
  Pass interference, fourth quarter. 
  Clouded judgment. 
  Unnecessary roughness. 
  You didn't even play last week. 
  That's what kept me from playing. 
  I lost us the game before you even stepped on the field. 
  All right, let's break it down, boys. 
  Get in here. 
  Eagles on three. 
  1, 2, 3. 
  ALL: Eagles! 
  JORDAN: All right. 
  COOP: No, seriously, Dillon beat him at dominoes again. 
  You should have seen Mr. 
  Roundtree's face. 
  I thought he was gonna I don't want you hanging around that Patience girl anymore. 
  There's been rumblings in the Church. 
  She's trouble. 
  So You think Patience is trouble because she's gay? 
  Because that would make me trouble since Since I'm gay, too. 
  You're not gay. 
  You're confused. 
  And it's girls like Patience that are confusing you. 
  Mom, look at me, please. 
  I am gay. 
  And there is no amount of prayer that's gonna change that. 
  Trust me, I've tried. 
  I love you, Tamia. 
  Your father and I worked hard to raise you right. 
  But I'm sorry. 
  I I can't condone this. 
  So if you cannot abide by our rules, you cannot live in this house. 
  Well, then I guess I don't live here anymore. 
  [DOOR CLOSES] 
  [INDISTINCT CHATTER] 
  Hey, what up? 
  I thought I made myself clear that you ain't welcome here no more. 
  Your boy, Cameron, he quick on his feet, but he telegraphs where he gonna go with his eyes. 
  Every play. 
  You get him to stop doing that, you got a straight line to the playoffs. 
  Hey, yo. 
  Why you helping us? 
  'Cause no matter what you say, this is my community, this is my family, and this is who I am. 
  Me playing for Beverly ain't gonna change that. 
  Family, we help each other, right? 
  Plus, I want to play the best version of y'all in the playoffs. 
  BAKER: Jordan, I need for you to know that none of what happened yesterday is your fault. 
  Yesterday you said I know I know what I said. 
  Um, I was scared. 
  I was angry, and I was wrong. 
  Your mother and I, we should have had a talk with you a long time ago about the reality of facing the police, and that's on me. 
  That's my bad. 
  See, I'm gonna fix that today, because the most important thing to us is keeping you and your sister alive. 
  If I looked like Spencer, would you have had the talk with me earlier? 
  Probably. 
  Yeah, I I think I would. 
  Why have you never taken me to Crenshaw, dad? 
  We live 30 minutes away from where you grew up, and the first time I spent any real time there was yesterday. 
  Are you ashamed of me? 
  Is that it? 
  Jordan, of course I'm not ashamed of you. 
  I love you. 
  Now, I don't spend time in Crenshaw, but that That has more to do with with my past. 
  But, you know, you're right, I shouldn't keep you separated from any part of who you are. 
  And I have an idea of a good place to start. 
  ["COLD WAR" BY CAUTIOUS CLAY PLAYING] 
  Yellow-tinted lenses and a pink gelato falling out the window, hit me back tomorrow we'll always be the one tough act to follow 'cause we aiming for the stars with a point and hollow feeling these songs, mocking jokes and Carols started this job selling rocks and arrows 'cause they only swipe right if you for follows [DOORBELL RINGS]
