 Previously on "All American" Shawn! 
  Come on, man. 
  I'll meet you tonight just like you wanted. 
  Look who's protecting who now. 
  Crenshaw will always be a part of who I am. 
  But being a Beverly Eagle, that's a part of who I'm becoming. 
  Eagles on 3. 
  1, 2, 3. 
  Eagles! 
  - Rehab? 
  - I just went down a bad path. 
  It's fine, though. 
  Is it? 
  You know, you're the first person to even ask me that. 
  Mom, look at me. 
  I am gay. 
  And there is no amount of prayer that's gonna change that. 
  So if you cannot abide by our rules, you cannot live in this house. 
  Well, then I guess I don't live here anymore. 
  I have nowhere else to go. 
  - My dad and Grace James? 
  - Oh, yeah. 
  Let me show you something. 
  That's them right there. 
  Yeah, as inseparable as they were all through high school, I just knew they were gonna end up married. 
  Funny how things have a way of working out. 
  Her son living with you guys and all. 
  Listen up. 
  Listen up. 
  Listen up. 
  Listen up. 
  Listen up. 
  All right. 
  Tonight, you all finally played to your full potential. 
  - Yeah! 
  - Yeah! 
  This is what happens when you play together as a team. 
  We sent a message to the whole league tonight. 
  You know what that message is? 
  - What's that, Coach? 
  - Tell us, Coach. 
  If you're gonna come, you got to come through us. 
  I said, if you're gonna come, you got to come through us. 
  This was much more than just one win. 
  This was the beginning of something special. 
  That's right. 
  Let's keep it rolling. 
  Get it right now! 
  Get in here. 
  Message on 3. 
  Message on 3. 
  1, 2, 3. 
  Message! 
  Coach, can you explain your team's dramatic turnaround? 
  The talent was always there. 
  We just needed to come together. 
  There seems to be an excitement surrounding this team that Beverly High hasn't seen in a long time. 
  This is the team that we've been trying to build ever since I first came to Beverly. 
  We finally have all the pieces that we need. 
  With the addition of Spencer James? 
  Spencer, yes. 
  He obviously is a very special player, but I tell you one thing, he is not even scratching the surface as far as how good he's going to be. 
  All I'm saying is going strictly off fantasy points, touchdowns are worth more than interceptions. 
  Man, come on! 
  A pick can change the game. 
  And a touchdown can win a game. 
  So you think your 5 touchdowns in the last 3 games are more important than Spencer's 5 picks? 
  We're all riding the same wave. 
  Can we talk about anything other than football, please? 
  What's up? 
  Look at you fitting in with the cool kids. 
  I don't know about all that. 
  On the field maybe, but off the field, it still feels kind of Forced? 
  Yeah. 
  Trust me. 
  I feel you. 
  I'm still not sure how I fit into all this yet, you know? 
  There's only one way to find out. 
  Come chill with us. 
  Um you know what? 
  No. 
  I don't think so. 
  I'm just, uh, picking up some food to go, so You sure? 
  All right. 
  I'll see you back at the house. 
  OK. 
  Who asked for the bill? 
  I did. 
  Well, give me your cards. 
  How much I owe? 
  Why are we calling it so early? 
  Don't worry about it, Spence. 
  I got you. 
  Nah, man. 
  What, this ain't enough? 
  No, no, it's cool. 
  I got an allowance card for stuff like this. 
  It's not a big deal. 
  Just get me next time. 
  Thanks again. 
  I'll get you next time, too, J. 
  Yeah. 
  Everybody's leaving? 
  We're not going home early. 
  My dad's out of town. 
  Whoa. 
  All weekend? 
  Who who are you texting? 
  Uh, everyone! 
  Yo, am I missing something? 
  Hey, listen, Asher's parties, they're legendary, OK? 
  He don't sound like he want to throw a party to me. 
  Are you kidding? 
  Asher lives for these parties. 
  This will be the first one since he moved to the new house. 
  It's the best party of the year. 
  You should come. 
  Nah. 
  I go home on weekends. 
  Yeah, I know. 
  And you do that every weekend. 
  And you never come out. 
  So just come to the party and go home after. 
  I'll think about it. 
  You do that. 
  - Ready? 
  - Yeah. 
  What's in the bag? 
  Check it. 
  You boosting a laundromat, Shawn? 
  Nah, they're just keeping it safe. 
  Whose paper is this? 
  That's my paper. 
  Remember that. 
  Stick with me, you'll get yours. 
  - What do you think? 
  - About what? 
  I'm holding up two ties. 
  Um, solid blue. 
  Well, I think I'll go with the stripes. 
  Glad I could help. 
  What's it for? 
  Your mom's got one of her things tonight. 
  Don't you usually bail on those? 
  This one's mandatory. 
  What's up? 
  Um, I just wanted to let you know that I might be a little over my allowance limit this month. 
  Oh, no. 
  Again? 
  Jordan, you promised. 
  I know. 
  I know. 
  It's just Spencer's been hanging out a lot more, which is great for the team, but when the bill comes, he can't always cover his end, you know? 
  So I just wanted to make sure he doesn't feel left out. 
  Got it. 
  Well, I know you're trying to do the right thing. 
  I think that's cool, but, uh, I've been in Spencer's shoes, and he doesn't need you paying for him. 
  He is not your responsibility. 
  But he's yours. 
  Well, while he's under my roof, he is, yeah. 
  So I'll take care of it. 
  Yo, Spence, hold up. 
  What's up, Coach? 
  Did you get that film on Culver City? 
  Oh, yeah, I already watched it. 
  My man. 
  It's all right. 
  They solid, too. 
  We got to be on point. 
  Yeah, yeah. 
  Look, I wanted to give you this. 
  It's just an allowance. 
  It should get you through the next couple of months. 
  Nah, I'm good, Coach. 
  No. 
  I gave one to Jordan and Olivia. 
  They your kids. 
  Look, my ma's giving me money whenever she can, all right? 
  So I'm good. 
  - Spencer - Look, I don't want it. 
  All right? 
  I'm good. 
  Thank you, though. 
  I respect that more than you know. 
  But you're living in Beverly Hills now. 
  It comes with a price. 
  Plus, I brought you here. 
  So it's only fair that I help take some of that burden off you. 
  Hey, come on, man. 
  Ah, spend it, don't spend it, that's on you, but I'll feel much better knowing that you got it. 
  - Coach? 
  - Get out of here. 
  Wow. 
  I forgot about this view. 
  Yeah, it's been a while since you were here. 
  Does it feel weird? 
  Well, now it kind of does. 
  I'm sorry. 
  I just I'm trying not to force anything, and I just missed you. 
  Hey, I don't know if you know, but Asher's having a party tonight. 
  Yeah, JJ created an Instagram for it. 
  So why don't you come to the party? 
  Seriously? 
  What? 
  I was in rehab, Leila. 
  I'm not really sure being around beer pong and jell-o shots is advisable right now. 
  You know, I didn't realize how bad it was until you went away. 
  It's OK, really. 
  Trust me, I am so over being the sad rehab girl who just sits home alone every weekend. 
  Well, if you did come, you wouldn't have to drink. 
  Here. 
  I'll tell you what, as an act of solidarity, I won't drink either. 
  And you can bring Spencer. 
  Spencer went home already. 
  OK, so go get him. 
  Drag him back. 
  He does the same thing you do. 
  And, besides, I know you like him. 
  No, I don't! 
  Olivia, I see the way you look at him. 
  Yeah, kind of like the way he looks at you? 
  I'm with Asher. 
  You know that. 
  Look, I just want you to be happy again. 
  And I think this party might be a good place to start over. 
  Dang. 
  What's all this? 
  What's it look like? 
  It look like you bought out Reggie's. 
  Look, check this out. 
  I got milk, cheese, eggs I'm gonna fry them up tomorrow morning And oxtails. 
  Oxtails? 
  Ma's favorite. 
  Yo, how you get all this? 
  Allowance. 
  And you took it? 
  Look, I ain't gonna spend it on myself, all right? 
  My mom's always got a stack of past-due bills, so I figured the least I can do is help out with some groceries. 
  You you think I should be living here? 
  Come on, Coop. 
  You family. 
  I know, but I just I wish I could help out, too. 
  It's like everybody got paper but me. 
  What you mean? 
  What you make, a wrong turn or something? 
  Actually, like 3. 
  I'm Olivia. 
  I'm Coop. 
  Hi, Coop. 
  Um, is Spencer here? 
  He is. 
  Come on in. 
  Thanks. 
  They skinny. 
  You was right. 
  I told you. 
  - Hi. 
  - Hi. 
  Ha ha! 
  This is my spot. 
  I know it ain't Beverly Hills, but No, no. 
  It's I love it. 
  Right. 
  Why am I here? 
  You know what I did last weekend? 
  I watched "Girls Trip. 
  " Good movie. 
  Three times And a half. 
  It was just playing on a loop, and I was laying on the couch and just didn't change the channel. 
  So I had a crazy thought. 
  All right. 
  I say we go to Asher's party. 
  It'll be fun. 
  Fun? 
  Probably not, but it doesn't matter. 
  It still feels forced. 
  Maybe that's because you come home every weekend and I stay home every weekend. 
  Man, why you keeping that girl hanging? 
  Listen, he's always so serious. 
  I don't know when was the last time that boy's been on a date. 
  - Coop. 
  - What? 
  Shut it. 
  So what do you say? 
  You in? 
  I think you should go. 
  I'm just saying. 
  You guys can just put that stuff on the island in the kitchen there. 
  Thank you. 
  Baby, about this dinner You are not getting out of it. 
  Come on. 
  You know I got to prep for Culver City. 
  No, not tonight. 
  If I'm gonna run for D. A. 
  , I need you to do these things for me. 
  And I need you to pretend like you don't hate them like I've pretended to not hate booster parties for god knows how long. 
  You don't like the booster parties? 
  No one likes booster parties. 
  The boosters do. 
  I know you hate these stuffy political things, but right now, I need you to be by my side. 
  OK. 
  Thank you. 
  You're welcome. 
  You sure about this? 
  Not at all. 
  You know, in fact, "Girls Trip" is on again in 20 minutes. 
  You got this. 
  Yo, Asher lives here? 
  Yeah, not my style. 
  It's a little "Winter's Coming" if you ask me, but it does have a bowling alley. 
  So any advice? 
  Rules I should know? 
  Stay away from the dare chips. 
  The what? 
  You'll see. 
  You got rules in Crenshaw? 
  Yeah, don't step on nobody's feet. 
  I'll watch my step. 
  Let me go holler at my boys real quick, all right? 
  - Yeah. 
  - You gonna be OK? 
  Virgin lemonade? 
  You two look good together. 
  We're not together, Leila. 
  You know this. 
  Um, maybe if he knew you liked him. 
  Stop trying to play matchmaker. 
  Sorry. 
  I just want you to be happy. 
  Why you sitting on my hood? 
  I don't want no dent. 
  What kind of ice cream is that? 
  It's rocky road. 
  Want some? 
  Man, hell no. 
  I don't know where your mouth been. 
  Get in the car, Coop. 
  How about you get in the car, Shawn? 
  Hey, you know how you said that if I stuck with you, I'd get mines? 
  What are you talking about? 
  I'm talking about money, man. 
  I need to make some, like, now. 
  So you want my help now, do you?

  A few months ago.

  You all right, man? 
  You just seem kind of I'm I'm good. 
  Let's just get back. 
  Crenshaw trust. 
  How can I help you? 
  Hello. 
  This is, uh, Billy Baker just calling to confirm a wire transfer I recently made to your bank. 
  Can I have your pin, please? 
  My pin?

  But remember what I said, OK? 
  Stay away from the dare chips. 
  Trust me. 
  Spencer, jump in, man. 
  Nah, I'm good, man. 
  - Come on. 
  - Come on. 
  The only person at the party who doesn't want a seat at the table? 
  I'm just trying to keep my clothes on, all right? 
  Just bet money. 
  Yeah, I saw you holding on to all that cash today. 
  Or is that, like, an emergency fund? 
  - Ooh! 
  - Ooh! 
  All right. 
  Deal me in. 
  All right. 
  What are you playing with? 
  Is this enough? 
  That's enough. 
  Yo, what we doing here? 
  I don't want no trouble with Alvin. 
  You ain't no trouble, girl. 
  You are up. 
  No, I don't need a cut. 
  You're not here for a cut. 
  You're here for a job. 
  Heh heh heh! 
  - For real? 
  - Oh, yeah. 
  Time to show me what you got. 
  You always bragging about how you cut everybody's hair. 
  Prove it. 
  Have you got skill? 
  Yeah. 
  I I do. 
  Just Then you got yourself a job, Tamia Cooper. 
  Ha ha! 
  - What's happening - How's it going Thank you. 
  I mean it. 
  I thought that you thought that when I said "job" I know what you thought, but I got your back. 
  You remember that. 
  I fold. 
  I re-raise you one dare chip. 
  I'm gonna call you. 
  All right. 
  Turn them over. 
  Full house. 
  - Oh! 
  - Oh! 
  Two pair. 
  You got me. 
  So I know you're new to this, but I just won your dare chip, so you have to do anything I say. 
  All right. 
  Hit me with it. 
  Go skinny-dipping in the jacuzzi. 
  Easy. 
  How long? 
  Well, that part's up to you And Olivia Baker. 
  Here we are. 
  Look, I'm sorry about all this. 
  You warned me about them dare chips. 
  You're not the one I'm blaming. 
  Look, we don't have to get in there. 
  I think blowing off a dare at an Asher Adams party is the opposite of fitting in off the field. 
  OK. 
  So who's going first? 
  Turn around? 
  Turn around. 
  You're the boss. 
  OK, I'm in. 
  Your turn. 
  You're not gonna turn around? 
  What happens now? 
  - Ooh! 
  - I call. 
  With what? 
  Name it. 
  A spin in daddy's Porsche. 
  Ooh! 
  All right. 
  Anything but that? 
  You want to stay in this hand, those are the stakes. 
  OK. 
  let's see 'em. 
  Trip Queens. 
  Ooh! 
  Pair of 4s. 
  Ooh! 
  King High, straight. 
  - Ooh! 
  - Ha ha! 
  Oh, my god. 
  All right. 
  Let's get those keys. 
  All right, man. 
  All right. 
  Easy. 
  I got this. 
  Ah. 
  This should be good, right? 
  So we just chilling here? 
  Most people do other stuff. 
  What kind of other stuff? 
  Well, it usually involves less talking. 
  Am I talking too much? 
  Kind of. 
  Then I'll stop talking. 
  Good idea. 
  - Olivia? 
  - Jordan?! 
  The party's over. 
  Hey, man, we weren't doing nothing. 
  Good. 
  get out now. 
  Don't tell me what to do. 
  Olivia, you don't realize what you're doing. 
  Go away, Jordan, right now. 
  Look, maybe we should get out. 
  No, Spencer, stay. 
  I'm not leaving until you do. 
  - I can't get out. 
  - Olivia, get out of I'm naked. 
  We're both naked. 
  Great. 
  Super great. 
  Now this moment will forever be burned into my memory. 
  Let's go. 
  Come on. 
  Don't talk to me ever. 
  Well, I guess now would be a good time to thank all of you for coming tonight. 
  You've not only supported my decision to run for D. A. 
  , but you've all been there for us as friends. 
  We know it's going to be a battle, but we also know that we wouldn't stand a chance without all of you, so thank you. 
  Cheers. 
  - Cheers. 
  - All right. 
 
 
 
  Hey, how about a refill? 
  Uh, single cube? 
  - That's the only way. 
  - Right. 
  Hey, is everything OK, Billy? 
  You seem a little distracted tonight. 
  I guess I just got a lot on my mind. 
  Well, Laura's a good one, and she's right. 
  There's a fierce battle ahead. 
  Well, we're prepared. 
  Yeah, I hope so. 
  Because her opponents will not leave a stone unturned. 
  What do you mean? 
  Politics brings out the worst in people. 
  Hmm. 
  I think we all have a past, so just know, everything comes out. 
  Leave me alone! 
  Let me explain. 
  It took a lot for me to come here tonight. 
  I was finally enjoying myself, and you ruined it. 
  Look, I I know you like him, OK? 
  I know you do, but it's a bad idea, OK? 
  Trust me. 
  It's none of your damn business. 
  I think he's our brother. 
  What? 
  I think Spencer's our brother. 
  Oh, that is how you drive a car. 
  I'm just happy you didn't kill us. 
  Ha ha! 
  All right, everybody, let's get back to the poker game. 
  Hey, maybe the game's gotten a little out of hand. 
  Asher, the Asher the Porsche. 
  No! 
  no, no, no, no, no! 
  No! 
  I know that look. 
  What look? 
  In my neighborhood, there's a look you see on a lot of the faces Desperation. 
  It's easy to spot. 
  It's a different look than fear. 
  Oh, what makes you think I'm desperate? 
  Come on, man. 
  All day, something didn't feel right about this party. 
  You ain't got no pictures of your family hanging anywhere in this house. 
  You always seem to be forgetting your wallet, and you let everybody else pay for this party. 
  It ain't hard to spot somebody with no money, man. 
  Look, I know you're in trouble, bro. 
  Look, you don't know anything. 
  I know somebody who can fix that. 
  Hey, are are these cars stolen? 
  Nah. 
  I mean maybe. 
  Look, don't ask, all right? 
  Yo, is that little Spencer James? 
  What up, Big J? 
  Ha ha! 
  Man, this better be good. 
  You dragged me out of my bed at 3:00 in the morning. 
  Look, I appreciate you, all right? 
  This is Asher. 
  And this Let's see what you got. 
  All right. 
  So what are we looking for here? 
  Good as new or good enough? 
  Good as new. 
  That could take some time. 
  I have to order original parts. 
  At least a week. 
  All right. 
  How about good enough? 
  Spencer, I Hey, we got everything we need right here. 
  Trust me. 
  It'll look good as new. 
  All right. 
  Do your thing, Big J. 
  Love. 
  Mm-hmm. 
  So how much this gonna cost? 
  How much you got? 
  Olivia, we got to do something about this. 
  No, Jordan. 
  I'm not entertaining your ridiculous theories. 
  Open your eyes, OK? 
  Dad moved Spencer into our home, treats him like a son. 
  How else is he supposed to treat him, Jordan? 
  He also took me down to a barber shop in his old neighborhood, OK? 
  One of the old guys said dad and Spencer's mom used to date, like, serious. 
  OK, well, that still doesn't mean that he's our Br And he also deposited money into a Crenshaw bank account. 
  Whose bank account? 
  I called the bank to try to find out, but I needed dad's pin. 
  In here. 
  Hey, what up, ma? 
  You hungry? 
  Nah, I'm good. 
  Got lots here to eat 4 types of cereal, oxtail. 
  The oxtail's for you. 
  I don't need no oxtail. 
  So what, I can't buy you groceries now? 
  You didn't buy me any groceries. 
  Billy Baker did, and that is not OK. 
  Look, he wanted me to have an allowance, all right? 
  Whatever you spent on these groceries, I'ma pay him back. 
  And whatever allowance you have left, you're gonna give it back to him tonight. 
  It's all gone. 
  How much? 
  This ain't you, Spencer. 
  What am I supposed to do? 
  You wanted me to move to Beverly Hills, and I did. 
  And on the field, things are starting to click, but off the field, I still feel like I'm trying to fit in. 
  I know it's hard, but that has always been your greatest strength. 
  You work harder than anybody else. 
  You don't need anything given to you. 
  You earn it. 
  Just don't you Pretend to be something you're not just to try to fit in. 
  And, remember, the free stuff, it always comes with a bigger cost. 
  You saved my ass, Spencer. 
  Whose car did we just fix, man? 
  It belongs to the family that owns the house. 
  They're always out of the country. 
  We rent the guesthouse so I can play ball at Beverly. 
  Why are you doing this, pretending you got all this money? 
  A year ago, I wasn't pretending. 
  We were loaded. 
  We lost everything overnight. 
  Was I supposed to change who I am? 
  I don't know how to be the poor kid. 
  Spencer, we got a serious problem. 
  Where's the Porsche? 
  Good question. 
  I parked it right there. 
  Someone must've boosted it. 
  No. 
  I feel bad about this, Spencer. 
  Stolen? 
  Right out of Big Js lot. 
  What you gonna do? 
  It's gone, Coop. 
  And it's all my fault. 
  If I hadn't have taken it to Big J's. 
  It might not be gone yet. 
  But, listen I could make a call, but you not gonna like it. 
  If the car's still in the neighborhood, Shawn probably heard about it. 
  Nah. 
  look, I don't want this on him. 
  Come on, man. 
  Shawn is not who you think he is. 
  He got me this job. 
  And if I ask him for help, he's gonna do this for me. 
  Why'd he do this for you? 
  'Cause Shawn got my back. 
  So it's on you. 
  What's up, Spence? 
  Me and him go way back. 
  We used to get into some trouble back in the day. 
  I remember we played darts in my uncle's garage, tore that board up. 
  And he picked up a football one day and never looked back. 
  Suddenly, I was a bad influence. 
  So when Coop called, I thought, "nah. "She must be playing. 
  Spencer James don't need anybody's help." But here you are. 
  Here I am. 
  I know this is hard for you, but I'ma need you to say it, because we equals now. 
  Say it. 
  You need me. 
  Spencer, you don't need to do this. 
  I need you, Shawn. 
  Damn. 
  That felt good. 
  I made some calls, but it wasn't my crew. 
  But you can't boost a car that pretty and not be running your mouth about it. 
  So you know who has it? 
  Let's take a ride. 
  Oh, no. 
  Just Spence. 
  Look, just, uh, just chill here for a while. 
  Coop will take care of you. 
  Are you good? 
  Hey. 
  Hey, dad. 
  Hi, y'all. 
  What's happening? 
  So, um, how was the dinner last night? 
  Oh, your mother was a rock star. 
  She deserves a medal for dealing with my behind. 
  Great. 
  great. 
  Um, so When I was getting my haircut, Alvin said something about you You and Spencer's mom going to high school together. 
  You never told us about that. 
  Oh. 
  Uh, yeah, I guess I guess it never came up. 
  So were you friends? 
  We ran in the same circles. 
  I don't know that we were friends, really. 
  But, uh, if you don't mind, guys, I got a lot or work to do for next week's game, so - Yeah. 
  - Uh Have a good night. 
  - OK, yeah. 
  - OK. 
  Thanks. 
  - Awesome. 
  - OK. 
  - Good night, dad. 
  - All right. 
  Good night, y'all. 
  So how's it look? 
  Good enough. 
  Come on, man. 
  Let's go. 
  Oh, my God! 
  Welcome to Crenshaw. 
  Hey, man, that was crazy. 
  Oh, my. 
  So you took down all the family photos, huh? 
  Yeah, I figured someone would ask why I wasn't in any of them. 
  Man, that's got to be exhausting, pretending like that. 
  Yeah, you have no idea. 
  I don't know how much longer I can keep this up. 
  You gonna tell anybody? 
  Nah, man, you good. 
  You good. 
  I think there's one person you should tell, though. 
  Do you know what my mom did when my dad went broke? 
  She packed up and left. 
  Man, Leila ain't gonna do that. 
  And if she did, she's not who I thought she was. 
  How much is all this gonna cost you? 
  I don't know yet, but it's coming. 
  My mom said the free stuff always comes with the biggest cost. 
  Hey, thank you, Spencer. 
  Hey. 
  Hey. 
  So last night in the Jacuzzi It was just a stupid dare at an Asher Adams party. 
  Let's just leave it at that. 
  So we good? 
  We're good. 
  - Hey, baby. 
  - Hi, dad. 
  Hey, what's up, man? 
  How was your weekend? 
  Uh Look, I got to tell you something. 
  OK. 
  I spent the allowance you gave me. 
  Oh. 
  OK. 
  All of it? 
  That was, like, for two months. 
  Are you in trouble? 
  Nah, nah. 
  I'm good. 
  I just, uh, lost sight of who I was for a second. 
  But I'm gonna pay you back. 
  - Spencer, you don't have - Look, hear me out. 
  I I appreciate you taking responsibility and all that, but I don't need anything given to me. 
  That's not who I am, and I don't want to pretend to be someone I'm not. 
  I just want to earn mine. 
  - OK. 
  All rightie, then. 
  - My man. 
  You didn't think you could tell me? 
  I didn't tell anybody. 
  I'm not just anybody. 
  I know. 
  When it happened, I was in denial. 
  I thought my dad would fix it. 
  Then a week went by, a month. 
  Before I knew it, I was trapped. 
  Asher, I wasn't with you because you had money. 
  I'm not leaving you because it's gone. 
  Hey. 
  I love you. 
  But if we're gonna have a future together, we have to be honest with each other. 
  Hey. 
  Hey. 
  Take a seat wherever you'd like, man. 
  Uh, actually, you got an application? 
  Good timing. 
  We just lost a server.
