 Previously on "All American" You want to have me committed? 
  Your mom. 
  She suffered from depression. 
  Depression can be hereditary, Sweetie. 
  You want to run Beverly football like a Division 1 College Program. 
  And you're not offering me any money? 
  Sounds like you want me to be your slave. 
  - Been a year, Mom. 
  - We're getting married. 
  I'm hoping that you'll serve your father divorce papers. 
  What are these? 
  Letters to my boys saying good-bye. 
  You must've did something to run him off. 
  You couldn't stand the fact that I'm more of a son to him than you will ever be. 
  Spence, chill, man! 
  I remember all this from when Corey left the first time. 
  I spent years asking myself what I did to make him leave, how could I bring him back. 
  I'm not doing that again! 
  You are not moving back into the house. 
  I've got it handled. 
  Jordan has got a girl pregnant. 
  Set? 
  Little tighter, little tighter. 
  Remember - This gonna be? 
  - This is to create Buzz and excitement. 
  Jordan, you ready? 
  Ready. 
  So yeah. 
  Uh, to camera? 
  To you? 
  To you. 
  Got it. 
  So, Jordan Baker, Beverly Football star quarterback, what does football mean to you? 
  Uh, girls. 
  Football is all about the girls. 
  Would you get out of here, OK? 
  J. J. 's all right. 
  Um, leadership. 
  It's all about the 3 rs. 
  You know, responsibility, respect, and, um, accountability. 
  I know I know that's only 2 Rs, but you can edit this, right? 
  Tell us, Spencer, why did you choose to play for Beverly instead of staying in South Crenshaw? 
  I came to Beverly to play championship football. 
  Well, clearly, you made the right decision. 
  State Champs. 
  Go, Eagles. 
  So what does football mean to you? 
  Football means a lot of things to me. 
  But I guess it's the lessons it taught me about facing adversity that made me who I am, so it's those lessons that mean the most. 
  Care to share some of those lessons? 
  When I was a kid, I was taught to tackle my problems, block out my fears, and always finish strong no matter what. 
  That's how I try to live my life. 
  Who taught you that? 
  Spencer? 
  Now, now, who doesn't love a rematch? 
  Am I right? 
  - Yeah! 
  - Yeah! 
  Whoo! 
  I know you've heard the whispers, and now I can confirm the rumors are true. 
  Coach Baker has agreed to host our South Crenshaw rivals in a friendly 7-on-7 rematch of last year's State Championship. 
  That's right. 
  The Beverly way will be on full display this weekend in our house. 
  I'm surprised you're cool with all this. 
  Not my idea. 
  This rematch is a lose/lose game for us, but I was outvoted by Athletic Director Hart. 
  It's an exhibition game, so we set it up to feel a little more like the real thing. 
  So be prepared. 
  This one here is going to be exciting to watch. 
  So tell your friends, have them tell some friends, and then tell some more friends. 
  Ha ha! 
  That's enough. 
  Cliff, a word? 
  All right. 
  Enjoy yourselves. 
  Here we go. 
  Are you good? 
  Yeah. 
  Um, just cover for me, would you? 
  Yeah. 
  Hey, my locker room is a sideshow up in there. 
  There's nothing wrong with a little bit of showmanship, something we both know you don't possess. 
  So why don't you do your job and let me do mine? 
  Oh, I did my job. 
  I won the State Championship. 
  Tell me, Cliff, what is your job? 
  - My job? 
  - Mm-hmm. 
  - I create buzz. 
  - Buzz? 
  - Excitement. 
  - Man! 
  Look, that state championship is already yesterday's news. 
  I'm trying to build something, a legacy that will outlive both of us. 
  We're on the same side, Billy. 
  Are we? 
  This rematch of yours, it's a bad idea. 
  We have zero incentive to play. 
  We beat 'em already. 
  Now, if we lose, we tarnish our title. 
  Then don't lose. 
  Hey. 
  Sorry. 
  I didn't mean to freak you out. 
  No, no. 
  It's, um, all good. 
  You OK? 
  So my doctor was able to squeeze me in for an ultrasound this weekend. 
  That's great. 
  It's just my parents don't know about the baby, so I can't, like, ask my mom to come with. 
  So - So you want me to OK. 
  - Yeah. 
  Yeah. 
  Um, yeah. 
  I Can be there. 
  Um, when When is it? 
  Saturday at 3 P. M. 
  Saturday. 
  OK. 
  Saturday? 
  OK. 
  Saturday. 
  Well, um, I'll just text you the info. 
  Um Yeah. 
  Hi. 
  What's all this? 
  What's it look like? 
  Don't you usually pay someone to do this part for you? 
  I'm not gonna pay a stranger to go through all my personal stuff. 
  Interesting. 
  Isn't that exactly what you're doing with me, paying a stranger to go through my personal stuff? 
  Honey, this ain't the same as therapy. 
  What's different? 
  Looks like you're wasting your time, which is exactly what I did today in therapy. 
  Sweetheart, therapy only works if you're willing to give it a chance. 
  OK? 
  You've got to actively participate. 
  What do you think of our new place? 
  Pretty great, huh? 
  Um, it's just another house, Dad. 
  What if it was more than just a house, Layla? 
  What if this one, we both work really hard to make it a home together? 
  I'm pretty tired. 
  So I'm just gonna go upstairs and head to bed early. 
  Not cool, Jordan. 
  Yeah, well, it was Simone. 
  Oh, good. 
  I was hoping it was the mother of your unborn child that you were ignoring. 
  Look, her ultrasound is at the same time as the South Crenshaw rematch, OK? 
  I can't go. 
  I don't want her to feel like I'm bailing. 
  Right. 
  So ghosting her felt like the better solution. 
  Not cool, Olivia. 
  This is different. 
  Hmm. 
  Since when do you ignore Asher? 
  Since we sort of OK. 
  Yeah. 
  Don't need to hear details, thank you. 
  Uh, no. 
  We just kissed, and we were fully sober. 
  I don't know. 
  I I really do like him. 
  So what's the problem? 
  I guess I'm just hesitant to go there with him. 
  I don't know why. 
  Only, Liv, uh, the last time you guys got together, you were in a bad place. 
  Maybe you just don't want to be reminded of your addiction. 
  Yeah. 
  It's not exactly something you forget. 
  Every day, I make an active choice to stay sober. 
  OK. 
  But do you need yet another reminder? 
  Reminder of what? 
  - Hi, Mom. 
  - Hi, Mom. 
  - OK. 
  Son - Hmm? 
  Grocery duty. 
  You got it. 
  I definitely felt that chill. 
  Yeah. 
  I think she's still upset I went to dad about the pregnancy first. 
  Hence the freezing out. 
  Well, now you know how Simone feels. 
  There he is. 
  Need a spot? 
  Oh! 
  Oh. 
  Go easy on me. 
  I see you've been spending a lot of time in here lately. 
  Just wanted to check up on you, see where your head's at with South Crenshaw on the schedule this week. 
  I'm good. 
  You don't think playing Crenshaw right after your pops left might open up some old wounds? 
  I appreciate you, Coach, but I made my peace with my pops leaving. 
  Honestly. 
  He did what he does best. 
  I'm trying to do what I do best. 
  And you know I'm with you on all that, but You don't got to play in this game. 
  Whatever Cliff is up to I ain't worried about Cliff. 
  Do not underestimate him, all right? 
  I don't want you getting caught up in his game. 
  He puts on a real good show, but he does not care who he hurts as long as he looks good. 
  I just want you to stay true to who you are. 
  Look, you ain't got to worry about me, all right? 
  Ain't nobody forgetting who they are. 
  I'm just trying to play ball and win, all right? 
  Yo, your moms is gonna flip. 
  We need behind-the-scenes shots of me to boost publicity for the game against South Crenshaw. 
  It's cool. 
  Could we lose this rug? 
  No. 
  She did not just disrespect your granny's rug. 
  Not only is your mom gonna flip. 
  She gonna end you, too. 
  All right, Coop. 
  Come on. 
  Get out. 
  I'm just sayin'. 
  Look, are you here for a favor, or you just trying to stress me out? 
  A favor. 
  The stress is on you. 
  But, yo, can you holla at Layla's pops for me? 
  I want him to hear my new track. 
  It's fire, but I think J. 
  P. 
  Keating could turn up the heat. 
  Why not just DM Jay Z? 
  I got a better chance of getting him on the line than J. 
  P. 
  I tried to have his daughter committed, Coop. 
  - True. 
  - Look, you and Layla good. 
  Just call her. 
  She could probably use the distraction. 
  But what if she don't think I'm ready? 
  Why are you down on yourself? 
  I ain't never seen you like this. 
  Man, look, I don't know the music game like I know the streets. 
  It's still all new to me. 
  Closed mouths don't get fed, right? 
  Laura. 
  What do you want, Billy? 
  Look, I, uh, I know that we promised Jordan that we'd give Simone and him some time to process, but I think that maybe we should get together and discuss the fact that, you know, Jordan's gonna become a dad. 
  Thought you had that handled. 
  Ah, come on Look, Billy, obviously Jordan trusts you more than he trusts me. 
  That's not true. 
  Doesn't even matter. 
  You clearly think I can't handle the kids alone. 
  Great. 
  So have at it. 
  Take the reins, Billy. 
  They're all yours. 
  I thought South Crenshaw would be starting their big-time recruit from Nevada. 
  Nah. 
  Darnell went back home after that situation your dad made go away. 
  Hey, hey, hey. 
  You can't use that footage, man. 
  Spencer! 
  No, I'm serious. 
  You can't film Crenshaw's practice. 
  It's a code violation. 
  And we stepping on their right to privacy before the big game. 
  We can't do it. 
  Stop, man. 
  We're not filming them. 
  We're filming you watching them. 
  This field is your origin story. 
  Well, I got to get back to my field, all right, and focus on my game. 
  Hey, yo, Spence, what's up with all these cameras, dawg? 
  Look, it's not what you think. 
  Mad disrespectful, dawg. 
  And I ain't even surprised. 
  You just a dirty player. 
  First you take out our QB, then you convinced Darnell to leave. 
  That's not what happened. 
  And now y'all out here filming our plays, trying to put our team's struggles on blast. 
  You all need to leave now before I have security put your asses out. 
  ROCHELLE, VOICE-OVER: Two seasons ago, you had 1,100 yards receiving and 23 touchdowns, both Beverly records. 
  It was a good year. 
  Last year, your numbers were cut in half. 
  500 yards, 11 tds. 
  Spencer James took my spot, but we still won a state championship, so Would you have won that state championship without Spencer James? 
  I think it would have been tough without him, for sure. 
  But I think sometimes we convince ourselves we need someone. 
  And when they're gone, life goes on. 
  How did the interview thing go? 
  It was fine. 
  What'd they ask you about? 
  Mostly Spencer James. 
  What about him? 
  I, uh, would rather not talk about Spencer James right now. 
  Has your mom reached out again? 
  What? 
  As if talking about Spencer wasn't enough of a mood killer, my mom? 
  - Ah, I'm sorry. 
  - Ha ha! 
  I just We didn't really catch up. 
  I don't know. 
  I didn't really see you at school today. 
  Yeah. 
  For a minute, I thought you were maybe ghosting me. 
  Well, I'm here now. 
  So let's talk. 
  About my mom? 
  She texted me. 
  And what'd she want? 
  Liv, is everything OK? 
  You're acting weird around me. 
  You think this was a mistake? 
  I don't I don't know. 
  It seems like maybe you do know. 
  Asher When did you stop being honest with me? 
  I'm just processing. 
  Right. 
  Asher, I'm just trying to figure out what's going on in my head. 
  That's all. 
  You don't need to apologize. 
  I get it. 
  I'll see you around. 
  No, but what I'm saying is, like, if you take that like that, then everybody else will Cam. 
  Hey, where your camera crew at? 
  They gone. 
  Look, I should've never brought them to the practice, man. 
  That's all on me, and I'm sorry. 
  Sorry you got caught? 
  I ain't no dirty player. 
  I'm sorry you all ain't got Chris. 
  And as for Darnell leaving, ain't much I can do about that. 
  I prefer to play you all at your best. 
  But, hey, that's football, right? 
  The game don't stop. 
  Oh, so your pops bounces, and you all win at any costs, huh? 
  Thought you was in Nevada. 
  I was. 
  I had to come back at least until I get some answers. 
  - About what? 
  - Why Corey left. 
  - Darnell, stop, man. 
  - Yo, look He was doing fine that morning. 
  He was excited about coaching, his reunion, you, Dillon. 
  I ain't got no answers for you, man. 
  OK, but maybe if we just put our I ain't trying to be mean, all right? 
  I've just moved on. 
  You should, too. 
  Nah. 
  I can't just move on. 
  You sound just like me 8 years ago. 
  You gonna drive yourself crazy looking for answers you ain't never gonna find, man. 
  Corey is gone, all right? 
  Just forget about him. 
  Focus on what you got left, like your future, football. 
  There's one thing I know about Corey. 
  It's that he never breaks a promise. 
  Yeah, and if there's one thing I know, it's that he always does. 
  I hope you find your answers, man. 
  I really do. 
  But I'm done blaming myself for him leaving. 
  Done. 
  Eh eh ah ah I-I I don't wanna see you roll Ahem. 
  Is this seat taken? 
  What are you doing here? 
  Well, I was hoping to find you. 
  Hey, now is not a good time, Mom. 
  Well, can you tell me when is a good time, because I've been calling you and texting you And I have been busy. 
  I got a big game coming up. 
  - Can I at least buy you dinner? 
  - Dinner? 
  Our last meal, you asked me to serve dad with divorce papers, which sucked, by the way. 
  What messed-up favor do you want now? 
  I just wanted to see you, talk, a chance to explain why we haven't This really isn't fair to me. 
  My entire future is on the line this season. 
  Maybe my future means nothing to you. 
  I don't know. 
  - Of course it does! 
  - I don't care, mom. 
  But it means everything to me. 
  I got to go. 
  Yeah, you know it's not my style It's not my style Yeah, you know it's not my style Not my style Uh-oh. 
  She hated it. 
  No. 
  No. 
  She didn't hate it. 
  - No, no. 
  I didn't hate it. 
  - See? 
  Coop, it's really good. 
  But not great. 
  No, it's all good. 
  I got so many other tracks you might like. 
  No. 
  The lyrics are perfect. 
  The song could be great. 
  It's just missing something. 
  But I have an idea. 
  Do you mind? 
  - No. 
  Do your thing. 
  - OK. 
  OK. 
  I just want my dad to love it. 
  Oh, OK. 
  So the hook you have now is more of like a pre-chorus. 
  I just think the song needs a new hook, so Here. 
  Maybe try these lyrics. 
  Oh, this is pretty. 
  Let me see. 
  Ahem. 
  OK, like something like this part right here. 
  Like You can stay, or you can leave But this is me, this is me There it is. 
  I don't know. 
  Something like that. 
  You can change it. 
  Yo, did you write these words? 
  Oh, no. 
  My mom did. 
  With everything that's been going on, I actually forgot how good of a songwriter she was. 
  So why don't we re-record the demo, and then we can send it to my dad? 
  Yo, how can I thank you for this? 
  Oh, you already have. 
  You are the only one that doesn't treat me like I'm a glass egg that could shatter at any time. 
  So let's play it back and figure it out. 
  So what's it mean to be a leader? 
  Your team has to look up to you, you know. 
  When you're QB1, you lead by example. 
  It's about earning the respect of each player on the team. 
  Jordan! 
  Jordan! 
  Jordan! 
  Whoo! 
  10 seconds, guys. 
  Who's gonna beat that, huh? 
  OK, OK. 
  Step aside. 
  I'm here for the crown. 
  Beast mode. 
  Oh, my God. 
  Since when did the pregame ritual turn into an eating contest? 
  You can thank your pops. 
  They just showing out for the cameras. 
  - Yeah! 
  - Let's go! 
  Let's go! 
  Hi. 
  It's Olivia. 
  Um I kind of really need you to call me back because I really want a drink, and I'm kind of embarrassed to admit that, but there's a lot going on with my parents and my brother. 
  And whatever. 
  I just I need you to work your sponsor superpowers. 
  It's been a really rough week. 
  Simone, hi. 
  - Hi. 
  - Hi. 
  I know what you're doing. 
  I really need you to move. 
  Your brother's not going to get away with ghosting me, Olivia. 
  I know. 
  He's a jerk. 
  No argument there. 
  I just think you should take a breath and think it over before causing a scene in there. 
  I'm just gonna go talk to him. 
  I know, but you seem really upset. 
  I am upset. 
  Which you have every right to be, OK? 
  But he's in there with his team and cameras. 
  Do you really want everyone in your business? 
  How did I become this girl, Olivia? 
  You mean this dope-ass, won't-let-anyone-walk-all-over-her chick? 
  Thanks. 
  He's gonna call you, Simone, OK? 
  I promise. 
  I was really about to go in there and make a fool out of myself, wasn't I? 
  No. 
  You were about to make a fool of Jordan, which would have been fun to watch, but this way's easier. 
  Why not? 
  Shh. 
  One sec. 
  Is she OK? 
  She's pregnant and alone. 
  Yeah. 
  Um, what do you want me to do? 
  Be a man, Jordan. 
  How can you even look in a mirror? 
  I know this wasn't planned, Jordan, but this is a reality that you have to deal with. 
  Take some damn responsibility. 
  Respect the mothers in your life. 
  She's about to have your child. 
  Make her feel supported through this. 
  Right, right, right. 
  Um, OK. 
  I'll call her. 
  Good idea. 
  Oh, man. 
  What you doing here, man? 
  The game ain't till tomorrow. 
  Nah, dawg. 
  We right on time. 
  Ready for our close-ups. 
  Let's see if you're still talking after the game. 
  - Settle down, white boy. 
  - What? 
  - Chill, chill, chill. 
  - Hey, yo, chill, all right? 
  Look, we ain't here for trouble. 
  Man, we good. 
  Playing a weak Crenshaw team tomorrow will just make y'all look like bullies. 
  What's this got to do with you? 
  What if I can make sure you're playing the best? 
  Give this game some real buzz for y'all's cameras. 
  You gonna suit up? 
  Now, look, I'm not giving up on finding out what happened to Corey, but since you only care about what happens on the field, I'll play for Crenshaw tomorrow. 
  If you beat us, I'll walk away. 
  But if we win, you got to help me find out why Corey left. 
  Camera's on you, dawg. 
  You're not gonna back down from a challenge, huh? 
  All right. 
  Bet. 
  Ain't no way y'all gonna win. 
  Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the Beverly High Crosstown 7-on-7 Scrimmage with South Crenshaw. 
  Jordan, come on. 
  First team's up, boy. 
  Come on. 
  Yeah. 
  Look alive. 
  Simone, hey. 
  Um, I know you're probably already on your way to the appointment, and listen, I'm sorry, OK, for a lot of things. 
  You're about to be a mom And that's the most important person in our baby's life. 
  And I need you to know that I promise I'm gonna be by your side, OK? 
  You're not alone in this. 
  Look, can we meet up later and talk? 
  We're gonna get through this. 
  Jordan, let's go. 
  Um, look, I got to go, but just hit me up, OK? 
  Please. 
  You know Jordan wasn't picking dad over you, right? 
  I think he was just more scared of disappointing you. 
  Maybe he was right to go to his dad. 
  Under my watch, he crashed your car, almost got arrested for fighting, and got a girl pregnant. 
  None of which is your fault. 
  I mean, you've been our rock, mom. 
  And Jordan's gonna need you, even if he's too dumb to see it yet. 
  Hey, hey, Beverly Hills moms actually take time away from they pool boys to show up for they sons, huh? 
  What did you say? 
  Hey, hey, hey, hey. 
  Save it for the game, ash. 
  Chill, chill, chill. 
  Forget it, bro. 
  Come on. 
  Any word from J. P. 
  Yet? 
  Nah, bro. 
  But right now, you need to be focusing on this game. 
  I'm locked in. 
  Trust. 
  It's my chance to finally put Darnell and Corey behind me for good. 
  So you really think it's gonna be that easy, Spence? 
  Come on. 
  That field ain't got magical powers. 
  So whatever happens in this game is not gonna make your memories of Corey just disappear. 
  42, blue 42. 
  Set. 
  Hut. 
  We'll see about that. 
  I'ma holla at you. 
  Set! 
  Go! 
  Crenshaw has just made a touchdown. 
  The score is tied, 7-7. 
  Beverly under pressure. 
  Just threw the ball away. 
  It's about to go Whoa! 
  That was a hard hit by Beverly on Crenshaw's number 14. 
  I thought it was just supposed to be light contact in 7-on-7 games. 
  Honey, relax, OK? 
  Contact makes for a better game. 
  Look. 
  The crowd, they're loving it. 
  Come on. 
  Let's go, Beverly! 
  Oh, Crenshaw has just retaliated on Beverly with a hard hit to number 11. 
  Where's the flag? 
  It's an out-of-league game. 
  Sometimes the guys just get a little more leeway from the zebras. 
  Ha ha. 
  Looks like number 11 is slow to get up. 
  You didn't encourage that leeway, did you? 
  Heh! 
  All right. 
  Let's go, Beverly. 
  Let's go! 
  All right, D. 
  Get it done. 
  Oh! 
 
 
 
  There you go. 
  And Beverly has just scored a touchdown. 
  And that's the half. 
  Beverly is up 14 to Crenshaw's 7. 
  Hey, Dad, um, look, I'm sorry I have to do this, but I nee Hey, how did you know? 
  Well, it's tough to be a leader on the field when you don't take care of your responsibilities when you're off of it. 
  I knew it would eventually click for you. 
  You better take the keys, son. 
  Get out of here. 
  Wow. 
  Thanks, Dad. 
  But, um, I think I know someone who'll give me a ride. 
  Where the hell's my quarterback going? 
  Right where he needs to be going. 
  Now, if you'll excuse me, I got a team I need to tend to. 
  Hey, you see those fancy uniforms? 
  All that new gear? 
  It should be clear by now whose team this is. 
  Boy, if you don't get your hand off my arm. 
  Now, I warned you, there was too much bad blood between these boys to play this game. 
  Now you got everybody all battered and bruised on both sides for nothing. 
  That is just a part of the game, Coach. 
  Since when is paying off the Refs to let unnecessary contact slide part of the game? 
  Exactly. 
  So please get the hell out of my locker room before I report you to the commission for bribery. 
  Huh! 
  You wouldn't. 
  Something like that could bring the whole program down. 
  Cliff, try me, because I will let this entire program burn down to the ground before I let you corrupt my boys. 
  Looks like things are getting a little heated on the field, folks. 
  Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey. 
  Hey, hey! 
  Ha ha ha ha. 
  Boys being boys. 
  It's all right. 
  Everybody's OK. 
  Turn the cameras off. 
  Turn it off. 
  Relax. 
  I know things got a little bit out of our control out there, but now more than ever, we need to rise above. 
  Now, we all been hearing this mess about the Beverly way. 
  Well, the Beverly way is how we won that championship. 
  The Beverly way means we play with class, heart, passion. 
  The Beverly way is good sportsmanship. 
  So I want you all to take that back out there with you on the field. 
  Do you feel me? 
  - Yes, Sir. 
  - I said, do you feel me? 
  - Yes, Sir! 
  - Bring it in. 
  All right. 
  Let's get it. 
  "Beverly" on me. 
  "Beverly" on 3. 
  1, 2, 3! 
  - Beverly! 
  - Let's go, "D. 
  " Put me back on "D," Coach. 
  No. 
  I'm not gonna have my star player get hurt out there on a bad play. 
  Look, I'm a ballplayer, all right? 
  You forget who I am? 
  Let me back on "D. 
  " I got this, I promise. 
  - Get your ass out there. 
  - Let's go. 
  Come on! 
  Right, right, right, right. 
  Crenshaw just threw an interception. 
  Number 11 is going to take it all the way to the end zone. 
  Block 'em out. 
  Get number 11. 
  There you go. 
  Let's go. 
  Run him over! 
  Run him over. 
  Let's go. 
  Run him over. 
  Run him over. 
  Let's go. 
  Wait. 
  Number 11 is slowing down. 
  And number 11 has just taken a knee. 
  If he doesn't get up, it means Beverly forfeits. 
  That's it? 
  You just gonna forfeit? 
  This ain't how I was taught to play the game. 
  This whole rematch was wrong from the jump. 
  I ain't trying to win like this. 
  OK. 
  South Crenshaw didn't win. 
  So I'll stay out your way as promised. 
  Why did you take the knee with me, man? 
  You ain't had to forfeit, too. 
  I mean, it's like you said. 
  That's not how we was taught to play the game. 
  Darnell, hold up. 
  Your theories about my pops, you gonna share them with me or what? 
  I thought you moved on. 
  A long time ago, I was taught to tackle my problems, block out my fears, and And always Finish strong No matter what. 
  Ha ha! 
  Yo, your pops, he said that one a lot. 
  I know I told you to forget about him and focus on football, but I realized standing in the middle of that mess of a game today that doing that is exactly what got me here. 
  I'm done running, man. 
  We both need answers about Corey, so let's find them Together. 
  Finish strong. 
  You know it's not my style It's not my style Yeah, you know it's not my style It's not my style I'm never changing who I am For anyone or anything You can stay or you can leave, but I've missed that You smiling. 
  Well, working with Coop and Patience on that track, helping produce it, it really felt good. 
  And you'll be happy to hear that I invited them over. 
  Yeah. 
  Your instincts was right about the track. 
  There's something special there. 
  Ah. 
  And they're punctual, too. 
  I like that. 
  Hey. 
  Layla, I owe you. 
  Man, thank you for taking the time to meet with me, Mr. Keating. 
  It means everything. 
  Ah, the track was good. 
  You should be proud. 
  So where's your other half? 
  What's her name, Patience? 
  Yeah, yeah. 
  Aren't you guys, like, a duo or something? 
  Oh, nah, I'm a solo act. 
  Patience just did me a favor. 
  Yeah, Coop is super talented. 
  I agree. 
  I agree. 
  But I got mad artists like Coop already on my label. 
  What I don't have is someone like Patience. 
  Whew! 
  Haven't heard that haunting sound since your mother. 
  Are you sure you guys ain't thought about being a duo? 
  Nah. 
  Like I said, I'm a solo act. 
  All right. 
  I respect that. 
  Hey, listen, you keep on hustling, all right, Coop? 
  You definitely got something special. 
  If your girl's ever interested, please tell her to give me a holler. 
  Yeah. 
  Sure. 
  Thanks. 
  I'm so sorry, Coop. 
  It's all good. 
  I was starting to think you might sleep in there. 
  I needed to clear my head. 
  Uh, your mom left right after the game. 
  She felt bad that Liv, I don't want to talk about my mom. 
  But I do. 
  I want to talk about your mom and that game and me needing to meet my sponsor this morning because that's how badly I wanted a drink. 
  What? 
  Liv, I I didn't know. 
  Will you just let me finish? 
  Please? 
  I want to talk about all the stuff we'd normally talk about before we messed everything up with a kiss. 
  I mean, hooking up made things weird between us, and I hate that. 
  Hey. 
  Doesn't matter if we're fighting. 
  You can always call me. 
  I know, 'cause you're my best friend. 
  And I realize now that I need that more than I need a boyfriend. 
  I just don't want to risk losing you. 
  And I don't want to lose my best friend either, so If that means not being with you, I'm OK with it. 
  Mom, what if Simone doesn't want me here? 
  Everything's gonna be fine. 
  Thank you for giving me a ride. 
  Would you Do you mind waiting until we're done? 
  Of course I will. 
  OK. 
  And, Jordan, I'm proud of you. 
  Thanks, mom. 
  - Hey. 
  - Hey. 
  Corey was acting strange after the picnic. 
  When I asked him about it, he deflected. 
  Maybe it was all the attention they were giving coach Baker. 
  I mean, that had to hurt, being reminded he wasn't good enough to make it to the NFL. 
  No, but he was good enough. 
  He didn't make it to the league because he was sick. 
  Yeah, Billy's right. 
  Corey had multiple myeloma in college, but he beat it. 
  Hold on. 
  Multiple myeloma? 
  Ain't that cancer? 
  Well, does it come back? 
  Oh. 
  What? 
  Nah, last year, um, Corey went to Phoenix for a month. 
  Mom said he had to get a procedure done but wouldn't give me any details. 
  Come on, man. 
  Ain't no way pops is sick. 
  And even if the cancer did come back last year, he beat it again. 
  Dude was planning a future here with me, Dillon, Darnell. 
  Unless he found out at the reunion that it had come back for a third time. 
  We really just gonna keep making up crazy theories we can't prove? 
  I can. 
  Dillon, baby, what is that? 
  I found it in Spencer's room. 
  It was addressed to dad. 
  And I wanted answers, too. 
  It's OK. 
  I googled the lab, and they're here in Los Angeles. 
  And one of the things they test for is multiple myeloma. 
  Is dad really sick? 
  If Corey is sick, then why leave? 
  Why not just tell us? 
  Because when this kind of cancer comes back, it's aggressive and likely terminal. 
  He probably didn't want you boys to see what he was going Hold up. 
  Hold up. 
  Is this really happening? 
  You're telling me our pops is dying? 
  Constant changes Constant changes Up all night Thinking about how I went wrong Just don't feel right I don't want to be here anymore The pain has to end The pain's got to stop The pain has to end When will it stop? 
  Just stop. 
  Kill the music. 
  We're done. 
  I need to be alone. 
  Monica, that was great. 
  I just want to be alone, please. 
  Just go. 
  Princess, dinner in 10? 
  Baby, what's going on? 
  I know mom was suffering from depression, but how bad was it? 
  Because on this tape, she's singing about giving up and ending pain. 
  Yes. 
  She was fighting depression, but I had no idea things were that bad. 
  Dad, I need to ask you something, and I need the truth. 
  Sure. 
  Was mom's car accident an accident? 
  Or did she give up? 
  Spencer, your motto. 
  Can you tell us who taught you that? 
  My father. 
  I always thought he was just talking about football. 
  He was actually teaching me the game of life. 
  Please don't Don't get up. 
  Just hear me out. 
  This can't be it for us, Laura. 
  You are the absolute love of my life. 
  What we had was one of a kind. 
  I was reminded of that tonight. 
  Not every family is lucky enough to have what we had. 
  Now, I know that I I have not been the husband that you deserve. 
  And I know there's a lot I have to work on, but I'ma do it. 
  I will do whatever it takes. 
  You name it. 
  Therapy Whatever it takes. 
  But I'm begging you, please do not give up on us. 
  I don't want to give up on us, but you broke something. 
  And I don't know if we can get back what we had. 
  Isn't it worth a try? 
  Tackling your problems and blocking out your fears means finding the courage to do what's right. 
  Baby girl. 
  Sorry I'm late, girl. 
  Suspense has been killing me. 
  What's up with J. P. ? 
  I don't think it's gonna happen. 
  He said he already got too many artists like me on his squad. 
  Is he crazy? 
  Don't know. 
  I ain't gonna stop, though. 
  I'm gonna find the right producer, and I'ma drop nothing but heat. 
  Well, I'm proud of you, baby. 
  And we don't need no J. P. 
  To make it. 
  All I need is us. 
  And if you don't, you can be sure you'll do something you're not proud of. 
  What are we gonna do? 
  You know, black men don't get the luxury of growing old and leaving this earth peacefully surrounded by loved ones. 
  We can't do anything about the fact that Corey is dying. 
  That's in god's hands. 
  What we can do is make damn sure that he doesn't die alone. 
  SPENCER, VOICE-OVER: And when you do discover the right thing to do, finishing strong means following through. 
  You see, in football, you never forget your last play. 
  But in the real world, nobody wants to live a life filled with regrets. 
  OK. 
  Come here. 
  It's OK. 
  It's OK. 
  It's OK.
