 Previously on "All American"  
  ASHER: Where'd that trick play come from? 
  Crenshaw's playbook. 
  Come up with a whole new playbook since someone gave Malibu ours. 
  As soon as I tell my dad what you did, you're off this team. 
  You serious right now? 
  LEILA: I don't want this to affect our friendship. 
  I do. 
  So, you don't want to be friends? 
  No, I want to be more than friends. 
  BILLY: The sports committee received an anonymous tip. 
  I'm afraid you all are gonna have to get drug-tested today. 
  RIPLEY: You put your all into some game and then for what? 
  I guess for me, there's just more to life than just football. 
  What happens if a player tests positive? 
  Oh, they get suspended for the playoffs. 
  I'm gonna fail. 
  I used to coach with your dad. 
  I even recommended he take over at Beverly when I left. 
  And Billy Baker, that man, he'll do anything to get what he wants. 
  TYRONE: I don't like being summoned, Shawn Scott. 
  This here's everything I saved. 
  So, why you giving me this? 
  Because I want out. 
  I want to take my little girl out of here. 
  Hoping this here buys me that. 
  Looks like we got a deal. 
  Just took me throwing some paper Tyrone's way and now we all square. 
  This here is for Bonez. 
  SHAWN: Wait. 
  Shawn. 
  Shawn! 
  [HEARTBEAT] 
  [BREATHING HEAVILY] 
  BILLY: Spencer James. 
  I need you to come play for me. 
  GRACE: How could you not tell me, Spencer? 
  - Ma. 
  - Don't "ma" me right now. 
  Tell me that going to Beverly isn't the best thing for you, baby. 
  SPENCER: I don't know if I can do this. 
  COOP: You can and you will. 
  I say forget this place and bounce. 
  Who wouldn't? 
  MAN: Hey! 
  Headed in the wrong direction. 
  Rodeo Drive is the other way. 
  [BREATHING HEAVILY] 
  YOUNG SHAWN: Look at me, Spence. 
  I'm going way higher than you, Shawn. 
  Man, you trippin'. 
  Coop, who's winning? 
  YOUNG COOP: I am. 
  YOUNG SPENCER: Coop always wins. 
  [LAUGHTER] 
  MAN: Oh, oh, whoa-oh-oh Oh, oh MAN 2: Got it in my sights BILLY: Come on, let's go, let's go! 
  [PLAYERS TALKING AT ONCE] 
  MAN: I can taste it now PLAYER: Wide, 300. 
  DIFFERENT PLAYER: Here! 
  Here! 
  Here! 
  MAN: It's who we are, it's what we [WHISTLE BLOWS] 
  BILLY: No, no, no! 
  Sloppy. 
  Sloppy. 
  Is this the team that just won the division championship? 
  Huh? 
  - PLAYER: Yeah, coach. 
  - BILLY: Play like it! 
  Please! 
  Get it together. 
  - Come here, J. 
  - Yeah. 
  What's going on with you out there? 
  I'm just used to Asher running that route. 
  I don't care who's running what route. 
  You throw a lazy pass like that, the Ds gonna swallow it right up. 
  Yeah. 
  Now, where's your focus? 
  Where do you think my focus is? 
  - Look, Jordan - No, no, look. 
  You and I both know as soon as those drug test results come in, I'm done. 
  Listen to me. 
  Until we hear anything, you are my QB. 
  Do you understand me? 
  - Yeah. 
  - What did I say? 
  - I'm your QB. 
  - All right. 
  Now, just run the damn offense. 
  - Yeah. 
  OK. 
  - All right. 
  All right, y'all. 
  Huddle up. 
  [BLOWS WHISTLE] 
  I understand it's been a tough week. 
  I understand that. 
  I don't care. 
  If you play the way you have been playing, we are gonna be one and done in playoffs. 
  Do you understand me? 
  - PLAYERS: Yes, Sir. 
  - BILLY: Do you understand me? 
  PLAYERS: [LOUDER] 
  Yes, Sir! 
  Now, I said at the start of the season, you win, you get recognized. 
  Well, we won. 
  "The L. A. 
  Tribune" has announced their regular season awards, and I'm humbled as I tell you that I have been named Division Coach Of The Year. 
  - [PLAYERS CHEER] 
  - BILLY: Thank you. 
  All right. 
  For real, I could not have won without each and every one of you players giving your all. 
  And that includes the Division Player Of The Year, Mr. 
  Spencer James. 
  [PLAYERS CHEER] 
  All right. 
  I'm proud of all of y'all. 
  We got a scrimmage on Monday, so, be better. 
  - You heard? 
  - PLAYERS: Yes, Sir. 
  - BILLY: You heard? 
  - PLAYERS: [LOUDER] 
  Yes, Sir! 
  All right, hit the showers. 
  Spencer, stay behind. 
  Hey. 
  Congratulations, brother. 
  BILLY: All right, man, get out of here. 
  Hey, I'm sorry I missed that practice, Coach. 
  I know you've been going through a lot. 
  Time's gonna take care of a lot of that, but, uh, I need you here, Spence. 
  Seem like everybody wants me to be somewhere right now. 
  Back home, they calling me a role model. 
  Everybody looking up to me and I'm Look, I'm trying to be there for them. 
  - I am - BILLY: Look. 
  We've been invited to a ceremony where they want to give us our awards. 
  I think it could be good for you. 
  I gotta give a speech? 
  A short one. 
  You know, thank family, the players. 
  Me, of course. 
  - You? 
  - Yeah. 
  Are you gonna thank me? 
  I'll think about it. 
  I'm proud of you, Spencer. 
  - SPENCER: Thank you, Coach. 
  - BILLY: All right. 
  You save your "thank you" for the podium. 
  - SPENCER: Right. 
  - BILLY: I told you this would happen if you came to play for me. 
  If you keep playing like this, you'll be All American. 
  MAN: Making moves like a boss Just the way I roll when I hit the spot They like there he go, let 'em know Let 'em know, let 'em know, know PASTOR: Quintell Dennis. 
  Marcus Heard. 
  Tyson Glover. 
  Jamerrill Maxwell. 
  Shawn Scott. 
  I'm tired, y'all. 
  - WOMAN: That's right. 
  - PASTOR: This list just keeps growing. 
  How many more names do I need to read in here? 
  I've known Shawn Scott since before he could walk. 
  He should be sitting right here, next to his beautiful mother. 
  [CROWD SPEAKING AT ONCE] 
  Instead, we're saying good-bye to him on Tuesday. 
  We have children leaving our neighborhoods just to stay alive. 
  Y'all ain't tired? 
  This endless cycle of violence. 
  Whose name am I gonna read in here next? 
  Yours? 
  Yours? 
  How about yours? 
  Am I gonna read your name in here next? 
  PASTOR: Spencer, thank you. 
  How's everyone doing? 
  Coop's hurting real bad. 
  Shawn's mom's a strong woman. 
  It ain't fair, man. 
  I can't imagine burying two sons. 
  Two? 
  Yeah. 
  Shawn's brother died last year. 
  So, how long you been out here? 
  Uh, about an hour. 
  I really wanted to be here for you, with you, but, um, wasn't sure if I should go inside. 
  Why? 
  Well, we haven't really defined this, um What, relationship? 
  So, it is a relationship. 
  I just I wasn't sure. 
  I mean, I wanted it to be, obviously, but we haven't had the official, like, "hey, are we together?" talk, so I don't Yeah, I know. 
  Good talk. 
  You didn't talk the whole ride. 
  What's on your mind? 
  You thinking about what Pastor Weeks said? 
  - Nope. 
  - Well, I am. 
  He's always saying the same thing. 
  Well, maybe if kids stopped dying, then he'd change his material. 
  I don't want him reading your name. 
  - I'll be all right. 
  - No, not if you keep talking all that revenge stuff. 
  What am I supposed to do? 
  I don't know. 
  I don't know. 
  Walk away? 
  You think if this happened to me, - Shawn would've walked away? 
  - No! 
  No, he would be doing exactly what you're doing right now, and that's why his name was read in church today. 
  Really? 
  [DOOR CLOSES] 
  I'm starving. 
  What you gonna make? 
  Sandwich. 
  Hey, make me one to go. 
  Back to Beverly Hills? 
  Got a scrimmage tomorrow. 
  When were you gonna tell me your little secret? 
  Leila? 
  Hey, I'm sorry, mom. 
  We ain't told nobody about our relationship yet. 
  I like Leila. 
  She's nice. 
  But I was talking about your Player Of The Year Award. 
  Coop told me at church. 
  Hey, that ain't no big deal. 
  That is a big deal! 
  That's why you moved to Beverly, to get noticed. 
  Spencer. 
  All of your dreams are starting to come true. 
  It just don't feel right. 
  Celebrating right now. 
  Everybody here in pain? 
  You don't have to feel guilty about accomplishing something great. 
  You earned this, Spencer. 
  You chose your own path and it's paying off. 
  Shawn Scott chose a different path. 
  Did he? 
  He made his own choices. 
  YOUNG SPENCER: I'm going way higher, Shawn. 
  Man, you trippin'. 
  Coop, who's winning? 
  I am. 
  YOUNG SPENCER: Coop always wins. 
  Get used to it. 
  Says who? 
  I'll scoop both of y'all. 
  Shawn. 
  Your brother's here. 
  YOUNG SHAWN: Damn. 
  Shawn's brother: Yo, Shawn. 
  I got something I need you to do. 
  Let's go. 
  But we fixing to hoop, Brandon? 
  BRANDON: Not today. 
  Get in the car. 
  What he want you to do? 
  Probably steal something. 
  For real? 
  Later, Coop. 
  See you around, Spence. 
  Big Spence. 
  Hey, what up, Coach? 
  We got quite a day today, huh? 
  We do? 
  Wait, for real? 
  What I told you about the scrimmage. 
  Scrimmage. 
  scrimmage. 
  My bad. 
  Yeah. 
  I'll be ready. 
  I certainly hope so. 
  The "L. 
  A. 
  Tribune" is sending a reporter to interview you. 
  I got to talk to them? 
  They named you Player Of The Year. 
  I think they deserve some face time. 
  I don't even know what I'd say. 
  Spence, I know that there's a lot going on at home, but now is not the time to to lose focus. 
  I'll do my part on the field, all right? 
  I'm talking about off the field. 
  Sorry, but my mind's on my community right now. 
  I already told you they need me. 
  They need you. 
  What do they need from you? 
  They need me to give them hope. 
  They're looking at me and seeing not every kid from Crenshaw gotta end up like Shawn. 
  I used to say the same thing when I was your age. 
  I I remember I wanted to save my community. 
  I ain't trying to save nobody, all right? 
  I just don't want them thinking I left and forgot about them, that's all. 
  Hmm. 
  Spence, when I left, it wasn't because I didn't have love for my community. 
  I couldn't carry that burden anymore. 
  I couldn't. 
  So, yeah, remember who you are, remember where you came from, but don't let the burden of your community weigh you down. 
  [CELL PHONE CHIMING] 
  Hey. 
  My bad. 
  Take that. 
  Patience. 
  Yo, Spencer. 
  SPENCER: What? 
  Coop OK? 
  Yeah, I mean, she's good right now, but she's not acting like herself. 
  So, who is she acting like? 
  PATIENCE: Like Shawn. 
  What you mean? 
  I don't know. 
  She's talking crazy. 
  Like about getting revenge for what happened to him. 
  Come on. 
  We both know that ain't Coop. 
  Yeah, that's what I'm saying. 
  And she's not playing around. 
  Just 'cause Coop would never pull the trigger doesn't mean she ain't getting in too deep. 
  She's not hearing me, Spencer, so, I don't know, maybe she'll listen to you. 
  All right. 
  [SCHOOL BELL RINGS] 
  OLIVIA: Was Asher suspended again or kicked off the team for good? 
  No, he's off the team. 
  - How's he doing? 
  - How should I know? 
  He's your friend. 
  Not anymore. 
  OK, can we talk about my problem now? 
  Nothing's happened to you yet. 
  It's only a matter of time, OK? 
  As soon as those drug test results come in, I'll miss the entire playoffs, and everyone's gonna know why. 
  I'll be the school druggie. 
  That's my title. 
  Stay in your Lane. 
  You think this is funny? 
  You'll live, Jordan, OK? 
  Look at me. 
  I'm alive. 
  On my way to calculus. 
  Mm. 
  mm. 
  I hate calculus. 
  Totally missed my point. 
  No, I get it. 
  I got it. 
  OK? 
  It's just it's different for me, OK? 
  Colleges will hear about this and nobody wants a stoner QB. 
  OK? 
  nobody. 
  It'll totally ruin my chances of playing football at the next level. 
  See, I'm so confused how the Malibu coach could order a drug test. 
  He didn't order it. 
  He he filed a protest. 
  Yeah, but how did he know you smoked weed? 
  I don't know. 
  It was just me and Ripley. 
  Nobody else was there. 
  Oh. 
  What? 
  Nothing. 
  You think it was Ripley, don't you? 
  But [SIGH] 
  [DIALING CELL PHONE] 
  Spencer, where the hell are you? 
  The players are on the field. 
  The scrimmage is about to start. 
  I'm sorry, Coach. 
  I ain't gonna be able to make it. 
  What did you say? 
  Look, something came up back home, all right? 
  I'll be at the house tonight. 
  BILLY: Uh-uh. 
  Spencer. 
  - I'm sorry. 
  - Spencer. 
  [KNOCKING ON DOOR] 
  Coach Baker. 
  - Hey. 
  - Gordon Bauer. 
  I cover local sports for the "L. A. Tribune. " Thank you for coming out. 
  Thank you so much for the award. 
  - You earned it. 
  - Thank you. 
  I was told I get 15 minutes with Spencer James before the scrimmage. 
  Right. 
  About that. 
  I-I'm afraid we're gonna have to reschedule that interview. 
  Hmm. 
  That's too bad. 
  It is. 
  Sorry about that. 
  Can I ask why? 
  Ah, Spencer was unable to be here today. 
  One of those, huh? 
  I'm sorry? 
  It seems lately, better the player, bigger the ego. 
  He actually has a family emergency. 
  - Right. 
  - Spencer is the most dedicated player I've ever coached. 
  If you say so. 
  [VIDEO GAME SOUND EFFECTS] 
  Oh, you buggin' now, fool. 
  There we go. 
  Boom! 
  Gone. 
  COOP: Tyrone, what are we doing? 
  What do it look like we're doing? 
  Tearing these fools up. 
  What you got next? 
  You're gonna regret that move. 
  So, we all know who popped Shawn and ain't nobody taking care of business? 
  Yo, Coop, you gotta ease up. 
  Nah, man, Shawn deserve way better. 
  Look, we gonna take care of ray for what he did. 
  Right now we gotta lay low. 
  And do what? 
  Play video games? 
  OK. 
  I like this side of you, Coop. 
  I didn't think you had it in you. 
  SPENCER: Coop. 
  Spencer James. 
  It's been a minute. 
  I ain't here for no reunion. 
  Is you forgetting where you at? 
  COOP: Spencer, come on, dude. 
  So, what's the big plan here, Coop? 
  - Plan? 
  - I know you getting somebody back for what happened to Shawn, so, what's up? 
  I told you. 
  I don't need no baby-sitter. 
  No. 
  It sounds like maybe you do. 
  - Why you got to do this? 
  - Because Shawn had my back - and now I got his. 
  - Shawn's gone, all right? 
  He don't need nobody having his back, not no more. 
  Why can't you stay out of this? 
  I told you. 
  I ain't going nowhere. 
  I'mma stay right here until you look me in my eye and promise me you ain't gonna do nothing stupid. 
  I won't make the same mistake twice. 
  What are you talking about? 
  I'm talking about Shawn, fool. 
  SHAWN: What you doing here, Spence? 
  I heard about your brother. 
  I guess it was just his time. 
  I'm sorry about Brandon, Shawn. 
  I'mma take care of it. 
  What you mean? 
  TYRONE: Yo, Shawn. 
  Let's go. 
  What up, Spence? 
  It's been a minute. 
  You running with us today or what? 
  Nah. 
  Spencer always got somewhere better to be. 
  You ain't gotta do this, Shawn. 
  See you around, Spence. 
  TYRONE: Ready? 
  SPENCER: He wanted payback just like this when his brother died, and I tried to talk to him, but I didn't do enough. 
  I keep thinking maybe I could've stopped him from going down this path, but I'm damn sure gonna stop you from going down this path, all right? 
  Believe that. 
  You're not built for this life, Coop, and that don't mean you weak, all right? 
  It means you strong. 
  Game. 
  Want to go again So, this is where you've been hiding out. 
  I'm not hiding. 
  [POOL CUE CLATTERS ON TABLE] 
  You a pool hustler now? 
  Is that the plan? 
  Maybe. 
  You're not good enough at pool. 
  Thanks. 
  You know, I was good enough at football. 
  That didn't work out. 
  Oh, this is a pity party. 
  What do you want me to do, Leila? 
  Go to class. 
  Why? 
  What's the point? 
  Um, other than an education? 
  Let's see. 
  Nobody wants me to come back. 
  That's not true. 
  Look, I know you're hurting right now, and it feels like you've lost everything and you're all alone, but I promise you, there is always a way back. 
  WOMAN: You gotta go Gotta right now Gotta go now You gotta go Hey. 
  Your dad let me in. 
  Oh, cool. 
  Brought you a phone charger because I've called and texted you all day and you haven't responded. 
  So, I assumed your phone must've died. 
  I know. 
  I'm sorry. 
  OK? 
  It's just the drug test results come out tomorrow and that'll pretty much be the end of my life. 
  Well, that's a little dramatic. 
  I missed the playoffs. 
  Oh, no. 
  Not the playoffs. 
  [WHISPERS] 
  OK. 
  Would that really be the worst thing in the world? 
  It just means we get to spend more time together. 
  Is that what you wanted? 
  What do you mean by that? 
  Ripley, did you tell someone that we smoked weed together? 
  Of course not. 
  OK, how'd the Malibu coach find out then? 
  What makes you think he knew? 
  He filed a protest. 
  For the entire team. 
  Don't you think if he knew it was you, he would've just reported you? 
  I don't like you right now. 
  Ripley, get And when I don't answer your phone calls, you can just assume my phone died. 
  [DOOR OPENS] 
  Hey, Miss Ruth. 
  RUTH: Hey, Tamia. 
  I came by to get some of Maya's things. 
  Tyrone offered to help me carry them. 
  You know everything here is yours now. 
  You could take the video games. 
  Maya ain't playing those. 
  Shawn wasted too much time on games. 
  You can have them if you want them. 
  Nah, you're right. 
  Video games are a waste of time. 
  - RUTH: See you tomorrow? 
  - COOP: Yeah. 
  I'll be there. 
  RUTH: OK. 
  Miss Ruth, I'll catch you outside. 
  All right. 
  So, I've been thinking it over. 
  [DOOR CLOSES] 
  I like what I saw from you today. 
  I got a opportunity for you. 
  Doing what? 
  Shawn was a good earner. 
  Rest in peace. 
  I'm giving you his spot. 
  Actually, I'm good. 
  Actually, I ain't asking. 
  I know you're not. 
  But I'm still saying no. 
  I don't want it. 
  You're being weak, Coop. 
  No. 
  no. 
  I'm being strong. 
  If you gotta do something, do it. 
  I'mma let that go. 
  For Shawn. 
  But don't push it. 
  I'll be back for the video games. 
  Spencer, in here, please. 
  What the hell happened today? 
  I was looking out for a friend. 
  Well, now you're gonna start looking out for yourself. 
  That's your move. 
  Excuse me? 
  What was it you told me before? 
  My community's a burden? 
  It can be, yes. 
  Yeah, well, it's not a burden, all right? 
  It's a responsibility. 
  You the one forgot where you came from. 
  Watch your mouth, Son. 
  I'm just trying to give you some advice. 
  How can I take your advice when I can't even trust you? 
  You got so many secrets. 
  I didn't even know you and my pops was up for the same job. 
  All right. 
  What are you implying? 
  That I took that job from your pops? 
  No. 
  I'm saying it's one more thing I should've known about. 
  OK. 
  All right. 
  Well, I need for you to be able to trust me. 
  So, look, everything I'm doing is to protect your future. 
  My future or your future? 
  I need you to look at this. 
 
 
 
  - I got homew - Come here and look at this. 
  This is Gordon Bauer. 
  He's a sports reporter for the "L. A. 
  Tribune. " He was supposed to interview you. 
  When you ghosted him, he got upset and wrote about it to his 98,000 followers. 
  I don't care what he writes about me, all right? 
  And I don't need no damn award. 
  What you don't need is - Nah, go ahead, man. 
  - Don't walk away from me! 
  Do you want to be an All American? 
  There are two games you gotta play. 
  One is out there on the field. 
  The other one is right here. 
  If you blow off this awards ceremony, those are headlines. 
  Colleges don't like headlines. 
  And when colleges don't like you, no NFL. 
  So, believe it or not, I'm trying to protect your future. 
  Dismissed. 
  LEILA: "Spencer James' rare talent doesn't justify his Prima Donna attitude. " Wait. 
  Who is this jerk? 
  Somebody with a lot of followers. 
  He doesn't even know you. 
  "Spencer James' work ethic is an insult to his lesser-talented teammates. 
  " Now he dogging my team. 
  "This year's Player Of The Year plays when he wants to. 
  " You can stop reading now. 
  Sorry. 
  Look, it don't matter. 
  No, it does matter. 
  Baby, there's nothing I can do about it now. 
  Well, you can go to the ceremony and show them the real you. 
  You sound just like Coach. 
  He wants me to go dance for these reporters. 
  I'm not asking you to dance for anybody. 
  Just go and be yourself. 
  It's impossible not to like you. 
  Look, I don't know if I deserve this award anyway. 
  I only won 'cause I was given the golden ticket out of Crenshaw. 
  How is that fair? 
  No, you won because you're the best player on the field. 
  Every single game. 
  And I'm really glad you got that golden ticket, because if you didn't, I wouldn't have a secret boyfriend right now. 
  Hey, dad. 
  Hey, you guys, when you hear a speech, do you like it when it opens with a joke? 
  Depends. 
  Depends on what? 
  If the person's funny. 
  I'm funny. 
  Am I funny? 
  Ah maybe don't lead with a joke, no. 
  Maybe don't What did you want? 
  I want to talk to you about the drug test. 
  She knows everything already. 
  Oh. 
  Ah, don't worry about that test. 
  Dad, you keep saying don't worry about it You passed. 
  - What? 
  - Everyone on the team passed, including you. 
  OK, how how is that possible? 
  Well, you got lucky. 
  The drug left your system before the test. 
  JORDAN: sweet. 
  Wait do you think the Malibu coach knew that I smoked weed? 
  I doubt it. 
  If he knew, he wouldn't have reported the whole team. 
  Right. 
  right. 
  OK. 
  Thanks, dad. 
  BILLY: Yup. 
  So, no joke? 
  I wouldn't. 
  I'm funny. 
  OK. 
  I thought it took at least 8 days for marijuana to leave your system. 
  Like I said, got lucky. 
  OK. 
  Hey! 
  My boy lookin' sharp! 
  Yeah? 
  I'm glad you and Leila are in a secret relationship. 
  That way, I can be your date. 
  You're always gonna be my date, mom. 
  Ohh. 
  Mwah. 
  You OK, baby? 
  I don't know. 
  There's a question I've been trying to answer for a few days. 
  I don't know. 
  Maybe you can answer it for me. 
  I can try. 
  Why me, ma? 
  Why'd I get the chance to transfer to Beverly Hills and and people like Shawn never get anything handed to them? 
  I told you. 
  You made your path and Shawn made his own path. 
  But he didn't. 
  Ma, me and Shawn used to be the same kid. 
  We liked doing the same things. 
  It was his brother that put him into that life. 
  Baby This is life in Crenshaw. 
  Everyone here has to work twice as hard just to keep up with the rest of the world. 
  Most of us don't even start the race until it's over. 
  You've been given a chance to start on time, and that's not an advantage, Spencer. 
  That's a equal opportunity to succeed. 
  So, go win that race for the rest of us. 
  Remember It's what you do with your success that matters. 
  OK? 
  Come here. 
  I'm proud of you. 
  MAN: You better be lost. 
  COOP: Hey, man, I just wanted to talk. 
  About what? 
  In case you was wondering, ain't nobody coming after you, man. 
  It's over. 
  [BAG HITS SEAT] 
  That's Shawn's bag. 
  He gave it to Tyrone, right? 
  Did Tyrone give you that bag? 
  Mind your business. 
  Tyrone don't part with his money easily, man. 
  You're right. 
  He don't. 
  Did Tyrone tell you Leave it alone. 
  Whatever you about to ask, don't. 
  Your boy already gone. 
  Ain't nothing gonna change that. 
  Anything else you try to do at this point gonna get you killed. 
  [ENGINE STARTS] 
  BILLY: Actually, I have a confession to make. 
  Uh, my kids helped me write this speech tonight and, uh, I was gonna open with what I thought was a a strong joke, but apparently, uh, I'm not very funny. 
  [LAUGHTER] 
  Ha ha. 
  I'd like to thank my wife, my beautiful wife. 
  She couldn't be here, but without her, none of this would be possible. 
  Uh, I'd like to thank the boosters who support what we're trying to do. 
  And last but not least, my team. 
  - [TEAM CHEERING] 
  - My boys. 
  Every time we were faced with adversity this year, they came back even stronger. 
  They have represented our program with integrity and accountability. 
  Anyway, we've got some work left to do, but, uh, I'm very proud to be Head Coach at Beverly, so, thank you for this honor. 
  Thank you. 
  [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] 
  TYRONE: Just gotta get through tonight. 
  - RUTH: I'm trying. 
  - TYRONE: Yeah. 
  TYRONE: I'm here for you if you need anything. 
  - RUTH: Thank you. 
  - TYRONE: Anything you need, I got you. 
  RUTH: I know you do. 
  Thank you. 
  TYRONE: Shawn was a good boy. 
  He was a good boy. 
  Our final award of the night is for the Division Player Of The Year, also from Beverly High. 
  Spencer James. 
  [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] 
  SPENCER: thank you. 
  I, uh Wrote down a list of names to thank. 
  I want to thank Coach Baker; my team; Jordan Baker, my QB; my mom; my brother Dillon. 
  [LAUGHTER] 
  You know, looking down at that list of names reminds me of another list. 
  Quintell Dennis. 
  Marcus Heard. 
  Tyson Glover. 
  Jamerrill Maxwell. 
  And Shawn Scott. 
  You ain't never heard of them. 
  They never got the chance to stand on no stage and accept an award. 
  And they all lost their lives this year. 
  See, when a gang member dies, everybody just shrugs, thinking, "hey, they chose this life, right?" Let's face it. 
  Most of their stories were written the day they were born. 
  They never had the same opportunities. 
  I think it's time we stopped shrugging. 
  Because from now on, I'm winning this race for them. 
  It ain't just about scholarships or making it to the NFL. 
  It's about giving back to where I came from as much as I can. 
  It's about giving them more opportunities so they can write their own stories. 
  Thank you. 
  [ORGAN PLAYING SOFTLY] 
  [PEOPLE MURMURING] 
  I need to talk to you. 
  Did you box those video games up? 
  Forget those video games. 
  - What's up? 
  - I want in. 
  - In what? 
  - Shawn's spot. 
  - It's gone. 
  - To who? 
  It don't matter. 
  You said no. 
  Now you on the outside looking in. 
  All right? 
  Take your ass up there and go kiss Shawn mom. 
  Go. 
  [INDISTINCT CHATTER] 
  Good speech. 
  - Thanks. 
  - Yeah. 
  - Look, Coach - You don't gotta apologize. 
  It's all good. 
  I respect you. 
  I respect your point of view. 
  We don't always have to agree. 
  OK. 
  OK? 
  Look. 
  I gotta go. 
  I wanted to ahem. 
  Your father and I. 
  We were up for the same coaching job, but so were 50 other candidates. 
  I was at a really bad place in my life and Getting that job saved me. 
  So, I mean, did I have an advantage because I was in the NFL? 
  I don't know. 
  Maybe. 
  But I didn't steal that job from your father. 
  I earned it. 
  Look. 
  why are you telling me this now? 
  Because I want to win back your trust.

  Because you had the chance to be great. 
  No. 
  Nah, Shawn was always coming at me.

  He'd always tell us, "Spence got somewhere better to be.
