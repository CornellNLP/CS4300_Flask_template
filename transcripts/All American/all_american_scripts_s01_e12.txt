 Previously on "All American" Mom, look at me. 
  I am gay. 
  And there is no amount of prayer that's gonna change that. 
  MRS. 
  COOPER: I love you, Tamia. 
  Your father and I worked hard to raise you right. 
  But I'm sorry, I I can't condone this. 
  OLIVIA: I just went down a bad path and tried to drown it out with pills. 
  Parents freaked, and here I am. 
  You also have a daughter just out of rehab, and the one person you're focused on, the one person you're trying to save, is Spencer. 
  JORDAN: We're gonna have to come up with a whole new playbook, since someone gave Malibu ours. 
  My life was falling apart, and in a moment of weakness Another moment of weakness. 
  How many times are you gonna use that sorry-ass excuse to cover yourself? 
  Wait a minute. 
  You want me to do what? 
  OLIVIA: Asher's homeless, and you have a big, empty house just sitting here. 
  His dad kicked him out. 
  He's living in his car. 
  It's your house, and I trust you. 
  SPENCER: Atoms within an element have full valence shells that are Um, un unlikely to bond. 
  Unstable nuclei decay in a stable atom's - Radioisotope. 
  - Boom. 
  All right, last one. 
  - Mm-hmm. 
  - Correct formula for barium chloride. 
  Ooh. 
  Uh, uh, B B-a-C-L 2. 
  - Yes. 
  - Yes! 
  OK. 
  I told you we ready to kick this test's ass tomorrow. 
  Which is a miracle considering how hard it's been to find a quiet place to study. 
  At school, someone's always pulling me into something, and now Asher's staying at my place. 
  So, how long is he staying? 
  Spencer, he just got there. 
  [CHUCKLES] 
  Yeah, well, thankfully, my mom and Dillon had that parent-teacher thing tonight. 
  Mm-hmm. 
  Amen to a quiet place to study. 
  Yeah. 
  And do other things. 
  [LAUGHS] 
  Come here, girl. 
  Mm. 
  We're supposed to be studying chemistry. 
  We are. 
  Studying our chemistry. 
  Oh! 
  That was corny as hell. 
  - Yeah? 
  Made you laugh, though. 
  - That's your line? 
  [BOOKS HIT FLOOR] 
  MAN: Can I be near you I need a clear view Just of this moment We can adhere to I don't want to waste your time - [DOOR LOCK CLICKS] 
  - We ain't gotta talk, that's fine - GRACE: Hey. 
  - LEILA: Hi. 
  Hey, Mom. 
  GRACE: How's the studying coming? 
  - BOTH: Great. 
  - SPENCER: Good, good. 
  - LEILA: Yeah. 
  It's really good. 
  - SPENCER: Yeah. 
  Mm-hmm. 
  Good. 
  Busted WOMAN: Go about my day through your eyes I feel you thinking WOMAN: Jordan, are you done? 
  - JORDAN: Yeah - OLIVIA: Morning. 
  JORDAN: Yeah, OK, but we have deets on their offense. 
  BILLY: We gotta be prepared to give them something new that's different. 
  Take a look. 
  JORDAN: But that right there Hey, Mom. 
  Mom? 
  Can you sweetie, hold on one second. 
  I have to I have to get this phone call. 
  - MAN ON PHONE: Hey, what's up? 
  - LAURA: Hey, Finn. 
  Uh, that new ad campaign is seriously boring. 
  BILLY: You see how fast he comes crashing off the edge? 
  That linebacker? 
  JORDAN: Yeah, OK, so how we change it up? 
  Playoffs and campaigns. 
  My favorite time of year. 
  LAURA: get it done before I get into the office. 
  [JORDAN SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY] 
  Hey. 
  You good? 
  Yeah. 
  All good. 
  WOMAN: You're mine, all mine, all mine I like you What the [VIDEO GAME SOUND EFFECTS] 
  How the hell you get in here? 
  - I got a key. 
  - Yeah, well, I want it back. 
  You can't just be rolling up at folks' crib like that. 
  The hell I can't. 
  Everything you got is mine, including this place. 
  Although it look like you might not be here that much longer. 
  Well, add it to the pile of others. 
  The damn landlord kicking me out. 
  - You short on paper or what? 
  - No, I'm short on years. 
  They won't let me take over Shawn's lease because I'm under 18. 
  Some B. S. about not renting to a minor unless I'm emancipated or something. 
  - I don't know. 
  - Forget that emancipation stuff. 
  Take your ass back home to your folks. 
  Make things right. 
  You get emancipated, you get popped, you go down as an adult. 
  You ain't no good to me doing 20 to life. 
  I guess I better not get popped then. 
  [SIGH] 
  [PILLS RATTLING] 
  PORTUGAL, MAN: Can't keep my hands to myself -  
  - [INDISTINCT ARGUING IN DISTANCE] 
  Think I'll dust 'em off, put 'em back up on the shelf In case my little baby girl is in need Am I coming out of left field? 
  Ooh woo, I'm a rebel just for kicks, now Let me kick it like it's 1986, now Might be over now, but I feel it still Might've had your fill, but you feel it still  
  WOMAN: Olivia! 
  You're going to be late! 
  [PILLS RATTLE] 
  You seriously keep watching that over and over again? 
  - JJ: Uh, hell yeah. 
  - JORDAN: Yes. 
  This is epic. 
  Are you kidding me? 
  Who does that? 
  I was there, bro. 
  I mean, I'ma give you that. 
  - It's it's pretty dope. 
  - Beautiful catch. 
  Well, don't act like I haven't caught you. 
  Rewatching it at home, either. 
  No. 
  You talking about another Spencer James. 
  - Yeah, OK. 
  - Just make sure that other Spencer James shows up for next week's playoff game, all right? 
  We're gonna need him. 
  - SPENCER: I got you. 
  - JORDAN: OK! 
  GIRL: Nice catch at the combine, Spencer. 
  Impressive hands. 
  Leila better watch out. 
  Leila ain't got nothing to worry about, all right? 
  JJ: You're really OK with Asher moving into her place? 
  I didn't have a choice, all right? 
  As long as he sticks to his room and out of our way, we straight. 
  Besides, I trust Leila. 
  You're a better man than me. 
  Spence, just, um, make sure you watch your back with him, all right? 
  You know it's bad when even JJ's still pissed at me. 
  You were friends before you were teammates. 
  - He'll come around. 
  - I betrayed my team. 
  Almost cost them the homecoming game. 
  - I got a lot to make up for. 
  - And you will. 
  Hey. 
  You all ride in together? 
  Uh, yeah, I had to drop my car at the dealership, so, Asher gave me a ride. 
  Is that a problem? 
  No. 
  It's all good. 
  - OK. 
  - Come on. 
  We gonna be late for class. 
  LEILA: Hey, you're unusually quiet. 
  Are you sure everything's OK? 
  Yes. 
  Need focus for the test, you know. 
  Shouldn't Olivia be here by now? 
  [RATTLING GATES] 
  I need to talk to you. 
  I'm sorry. 
  Hey. 
  I'm your sponsor. 
  This is what I'm here for. 
  I don't understand. 
  I've been fine. 
  That's the nature of the beast, you know? 
  You're in control, everything's going great, and all of a sudden, something comes out of nowhere and bam. 
  But why now? 
  I've been to parties, I've been around drugs and alcohol, and then today, I literally find one bottle of pills, and it's like I'm back to 2017 me again, just like that. 
  This is the part where you gotta dig deep, figure out what demons got stirred up for you today and why. 
  OLIVIA: So, Mom and Dad are on a staycation weekend or whatever, which means party time for us at the house. 
  No, Liv, that's not a good idea. 
  You always say that, and then you always have a good time. 
  JJ! 
  Party Chez baker tonight. 
  Spread the word. 
  Hey! 
  Consider it spread. 
  JJ, no. 
  Don't you dare. 
  Hey, sorry, bro, the queen has spoken. 
  Get a room. 
  - [LEILA GIGGLES] 
  - ASHER: Jealous much? 
  Bye, baby. 
  Let's go find us some trouble. 
  [GIGGLES] 
  [LAUGHS] 
  [KNOCKING] 
  [DOOR UNLOCKS] 
  I left you, like, 3 messages. 
  Yeah. 
  Uh, ahem. 
  I'm fine. 
  I just, uh, had a rough morning is all, so. 
  Define rough. 
  I found some pills in my room. 
  - What? 
  - I was tempted but it's it's fine. 
  I I threw them away and met with my sponsor, so. 
  OK, so, how can I help? 
  You can talk about something else. 
  Anything else. 
  - No, man, come on. 
  - Please? 
  Please? 
  [SIGH] 
  Please? 
  Um, how how are you and Leila? 
  Look, I'm sorry if the whole Asher thing is causing problems. 
  I really didn't mean to start anything. 
  I know. 
  I know. 
  It's just we just jumped into everything so fast, man. 
  I just don't want it to end before it's even gotten started, that's all. 
  Then don't let it. 
  [SCHOOL BELL RINGS] 
  Scrimmage time. 
  Hey, you gonna want to keep that helmet on tight. 
  I would hate to knock you out in front of Kia. 
  Why don't you focus on holding on to the damn ball and keep my girl's name out your mouth? 
  I can keep her name out of my mouth but I can't promise about anything else. 
  What you say? 
  [INDISTINCT SHOUTING] 
  Principal's office. 
  Now. 
  Where you going, bro? 
  My classroom! 
  I'm telling you don't move. 
  Bringing a student up to the Principal's office now. 
  Everybody back to class! 
  Back to class! 
  What the hell is wrong with you? 
  He gonna say some crap like y'all two been together and I'm just supposed to let that slide? 
  You're supposed to trust me and not take the bait! 
  Something's going on with you, Spencer. 
  Yeah, you've been in fights before, but that, what just happened, was crazy. 
  It's like all of a sudden, you're trying to push me away, and I don't understand why. 
  - I gotta go to the Principal's  
  - Spencer. 
  Either we have this conversation now or we ain't having no more conversations. 
  [KEY RATTLING IN LOCK] 
  So, where's your roommate? 
  Asher is probably still at school. 
  Yes? 
  So, I'm sorry I've been a little distracted lately. 
  I actually think "distant" is the word you're looking for. 
  Ouch. 
  OK. 
  So, Asher got a game plan, right, for when he moving out? 
  You said you were OK with him staying here. 
  I am. 
  I'm just saying with everything that's been going on, you and me, we've really had no alone time. 
  Or space to just focus on us. 
  And I want to change that. 
  You know what? 
  I'ma take you out on a date. 
  A real date. 
  I like the sound of that. 
  How about tonight? 
  Yeah, we could go see a movie or Oh, no, no, no. 
  I had something a little more special in mind. 
  I'ma figure it out. 
  Give me a couple hours and I'ma surprise you. 
  - OK. 
  - Mm-hmm. 
  - That sounds amazing. 
  - [DOOR OPENS] 
  Ahem. 
  - LEILA: Hey. 
  - ASHER: Hey. 
  [CLATTERING] 
  - OLIVIA: Do you have a second? 
  - LAURA: Which one do you think? 
  The blue or the cream? 
  Are you going somewhere? 
  Uh, if your father ever makes it home, yes. 
  - BILLY: Baby! 
  - LAURA: In here! 
  Why is there a date in my calendar for Laura's ocean club for tonight and I don't remember putting it in there? 
  Because you didn't put it in there, I did, and our date is non-negotiable, - so, you better go get dressed. 
  - Oh Plus, I'm leaving town tomorrow. 
  - BILLY: Say what? 
  - OLIVIA: Wait, seriously? 
  Yeah, just a few days. 
  - I gotta go meet a new client. 
  - BILLY: Oh. 
  Oh, and I got the booster kickoff event tomorrow, too. 
  - OK. 
  - Hence tonight. 
  - Surprise date. 
  - Right. 
  OK. 
  Oh, that actually sounds kinda sexy. 
  Come here. 
  Mm. 
  All right. 
  Cool. 
  I'll be down in 20. 
  Hey, girl. 
  20 minutes. 
  OK. 
  Oh, uh, sorry, Olivia, honey, did did you need to talk to us about something? 
  Yeah, no. 
  I'm good. 
  OK. 
  You guys have fun tonight, and wear the cream. 
  COOP: Oh, you really good with old boy being all up in her crib? 
  Sharing her space? 
  I mean, they eat breakfast cereal together. 
  I'm trying to be the bigger person, all right? 
  By what? 
  Not being honest with her? 
  By not acting crazy like the old me, and instead, planning a special day for me and Leila. 
  Your boy got "Hello, Dolly!" tickets tonight. 
  How in the hell you get "Hello, Dolly!" tickets? 
  And why would you want to? 
  JJ's dad hooked it up, all right? 
  Leila likes musicals, so, it's the perfect date. 
  What? 
  Yeah, if you 60 and white. 
  Man, shut up. 
  - But you a black man. 
  - Ha ha ha! 
  Listen, I'm out here trying to find a place to live, and you busy going all Keith Nelson on me. 
  Who? 
  Man, Keith? 
  Watts, Amanda? 
  You ain't never seen "Some Kind of Wonderful"? 
  - Nah. 
  - Look, man, Leila don't need no Hollywood bowl. 
  I think the perfect date should be something that's special to the both of y'all. 
  "Some Kind of Wonderful," huh? 
  Do not sleep on them teen movies, man. 
  - They was good. 
  - MAN: Coop! 
  Oh, snap. 
  - SPENCER: Damn. 
  - COOP: Dad! 
  Ha! 
  [GIGGLES] 
  Man. 
  So, when did you get back? 
  A few days ago. 
  Baby girl, look. 
  I'm I'm sorry I didn't get back to you sooner. 
  No. 
  I get it. 
  I ain't trippin'. 
  I just I did kind of hope you'd call. 
  I didn't know what to say. 
  I didn't agree with what your mom did, but as she happily pointed out, I'm not the one on the ground raising you day to day. 
  But I'm here now. 
  I'ma change that. 
  What's this? 
  Emancipation papers. 
  What is this about? 
  I need to get them signed, if I want to live here. 
  You know, take care of myself. 
  Or do you and Ma want me home? 
  No, we want you to come home. 
  To us. 
  Have you not met your wife, Dad? 
  You ain't gonna believe this, but your mom, she had a change of heart. 
  She misses you, and she's ready to accept you. 
  All of you. 
  You talking about the same Janelle Cooper? 
  Why don't you come see for yourself, hmm? 
  Breakfast. 
  Tomorrow. 
  MAN: Breathing in and I swear I've I'm glad you're home, Dad. 
  MAN: Seen your face before LEILA: Hey. 
  I've been calling and texting. 
  Yeah. 
  Uh, something came up. 
  It's OK. 
  Um, I actually have something for you. 
  I know how much you loved the remake. 
  I was gonna wait till tomorrow, but it's to celebrate your courage. 
  - Leila - No. 
  Let me finish. 
  Tomorrow is your one-year sobriety Mark. 
  Of course I remember. 
  I am so proud of you and how hard you fought to get your life and all that [PILLS RATTLE] 
  MAN: Moments pale I found them this morning. 
  Have you taken any? 
  No. 
  Not yet. 
  But it's been, um it's been really hard. 
  You know, every day I make an active choice to stay sober. 
  One day at a time. 
  And today, it's it's just not working. 
  Liv, you don't have to go through this alone. 
  I am here for you. 
  Yeah. 
  Yeah. 
  I wish I could say the same for my family, you know? 
  You're the only one who even remembered it was my one-year sobriety coming up. 
  I'm sure they remembered. 
  No. 
  But I I get it. 
  Like, they're busy. 
  And this time of year's always bad because of playoffs and my mom has her D. 
  A. 
  campaigns. 
  You need to tell your parents and Jordan how you're really feeling. 
  No, it'll just hurt them. 
  It's hurting you. 
  They can't fix it unless they know. 
  And you can't heal unless you're honest with them. 
  No more struggling in silence. 
  [PHONE CHIMING] 
  Ahem. 
  Hey, baby. 
  You close? 
  About tonight. 
  No. 
  Come on. 
  Don't say. 
  I'm so sorry. 
  Let me guess. 
  What does Asher need now? 
  Seriously? 
  I ran into Olivia, and she's having a rough time, so, I'm staying with her. 
  Look, I'm sorry, all right? 
  Of course. 
  It's cool. 
  No, I have to go. 
  Oh, no, you don't. 
  I have a few words for you. 
  Suspended from school? 
  Seriously? 
  Look, Ma, it wasn't my fault, all right? 
  Last year it was cutting class. 
  This year it's all these fights. 
  It's damn well your fault. 
  You control your actions. 
  No matter who says or does what, you are responsible for what happens next. 
  This cannot keep happening. 
  - Yeah. 
  - Excuse me? 
  Come here. 
  You have something you want to say? 
  Everything about my life is a fight, Ma. 
  And it's all because of one guy who never cared enough to stay with his family. 
  I get that you're angry that your father left, but that does not mean you get to throw away your future. 
  You think I like being mad all the time? 
  Ain't nothing I can do about it now. 
  - Wait, baby. 
  - No, Ma! 
  You can't fix this! 
  This is it. 
  Where are you going? 
  - Spencer. 
  - No. 
  I give up. 
  [DOOR SLAMS] 
  [PHONE CHIMING] 
  Thank you. 
  Gracie. 
  I need your help. 
  OK. 
  [SIGH] 
  That's funny. 
  He don't look like Olivia to me. 
  - LEILA: Excuse me? 
  - ASHER: Dude, it's not what it looks like. 
  I don't remember asking you, dawg. 
  LEILA: Hey, Spencer. 
  Here, so you can get in the house. 
  Way to go. 
  He locked himself out, FYI. 
  Hey, jealousy is not a good look on you. 
  Yeah, my girl lying to me ain't a good look, either. 
  I have never lied to you. 
  I would never do that. 
  And the fact that you assume instead of asking me what happened hurts. 
  What am I supposed to think? 
  Huh? 
  You moved homeboy into your house. 
  First quality time was the issue. 
  Now it's Asher living with me. 
  Which one is it, because it seems like you're just looking for problems. 
  And no, for the record, I asked you, like, 100 times if you were OK with Asher moving in with me, and instead of you telling me the truth, - you lied to me. 
  - Come on. 
  Open your eyes. 
  - What did you expect? 
  - I expected you to trust me. 
  - Look, I do trust you. 
  - No, you don't trust me. 
 
 
 
  You want to believe those words when you say them, but the truth is you don't. 
  And what hurts is I have never given you a reason not to. 
  Leila. 
  L GRACE: It's Spencer. 
  He's been getting into a lot of trouble at school lately. 
  In and out of fights. 
  He was just suspended again. 
  You're a coach at Beverly. 
  I think a change of environment, going to a school that can offer him more than just football, a school that doesn't remind him of Corey every single day may be the only way to save him. 
  Just come watch him play once he's back in school. 
  - GRACE: Maybe that'll - BILLY: There are rules. 
  There are rules and and I, I'm just not in the position to to bend them. 
  What? 
  It took a lot for me to call you, and I know that you have your own family and your own problems to worry about, but we owe Spencer this shot. 
  MAN: Light it up, let 'em all know what the business is Light it up, let 'em all know what the Li-li-li-light it up, let 'em all know What the business is Light it up, let 'em all know what the business is How many fingers am I holding up? 
  Holding up? 
  You in the building when we throw it up Throw it up I'm getting in, lock the door Smoke a number, this and though What the you sippin' on, this cup just got me [DEEP VOICE] 
  Slip and slide Yeah, I'm dope, got those feelings Everybody want to know what's got me feeling Yes! 
  Yeah, dude. 
  Yes! 
  The QB one has arrived! 
  It's time to party, bitch! 
  [CROWD CHEERING] 
  I feel I wanna, but you're so sick for me - How you feeling? 
  - I feel I wanna But you're so sick for me - How you feeling? 
  - I feel I wanna But you're so sick for me Light another flame because the flame make the party go Light it up, let 'em all know what the business is Light it up, let 'em all know what the Li-li-li-light it up, let 'em all know what the business is Light it up, let 'em all know OLIVIA: He didn't even want to have people over and somehow, he's still the life of the party. 
  You're not gonna run over and kiss the ring like everyone else? 
  Nah. 
  What bug crawled up your ass? 
  [SNIFFS] 
  Just got some family stuff going on. 
  Poor baby. 
  Join the club. 
  Wait. 
  Where are you going? 
  Wait, wait, no, don't go, don't go. 
  I'm sorry. 
  Family sucks. 
  We can toast to that. 
  Here's to our sucky families. 
  Cheers. 
  Cheers. 
  Ahh. 
  [GIGGLES] 
  Ahh. 
  [LAUGHS] 
  Should you be mixing that with whatever else you're on? 
  Ohh. 
  You worried about me? 
  WOMAN: Drips on your lips, on your shoulders When you follow the curve of my body I forget to breathe When you move me just like that - Hey, maybe we - Why are you still talking? 
  WOMAN: If you knew me, you'd know that I can keep going I can keep going You ain't never met someone like me before And you ain't never seen somebody do what I can do Do, do, do [INDISTINCT CHATTER] 
  LAURA: What's, uh - BILLY: Jordan. 
  - LAURA: What's going on, honey? 
  Do you know how sad it is that I have to send 911 texts just to get you all here to talk to me? 
  OK, what are you talking about? 
  I'm talking about the fact that I feel invisible in my own family. 
  - LAURA: Olivia - OLIVIA: Just let me finish. 
  Ahem. 
  You guys are all so goal-oriented. 
  You live in the future, always focused on the next game, the next win, the next campaign. 
  It's like you don't see the details in the present. 
  Except I live in the present. 
  Baby girl, obviously, we see you. 
  Do you? 
  I mean, why do you think I started using drugs in the first place? 
  Being the party girl at least gave me something, and then still, you didn't notice until I almost O. D. 'd. 
  And then you just threw money at the problem. 
  Shipped me off to rehab, and poof, I was magically fixed. 
  It was not a magical fix. 
  Nobody thought that. 
  Honey, it's it's it's what you needed. 
  Yeah, but it's not all that I needed. 
  Post-rehab, Spencer is the only person who asked if I'm really OK. 
  All of you just assumed I was and moved on. 
  We're so, so, sorry, but you've been so strong. 
  You're right. 
  We should have been paying closer attention. 
  I just don't want us to keep making the same mistake. 
  I mean, look what happened with Jordan. 
  - JORDAN: Liv - OLIVIA: He smoked weed, stayed out all night, and there was no consequence from you guys. 
  All you cared about was if he was ready for the big game or not. 
  - BILLY: Right. 
  Um - LAURA: I'm sorry. 
  What? 
  What is she talking about, Billy? 
  I'm sorry. 
  I I - I thought she knew. 
  - No. 
  I don't know. 
  So, somebody better start talking. 
  Now. 
  [SNIFFS] 
  Ahh. 
  Thanks for coming with me to see my folks. 
  For sure. 
  Where else would I be? 
  I don't know. 
  Probably somewhere picking up the shattered pieces of your love life. 
  Tried to call old girl yet? 
  I doubt Leila trying to hear from me right now. 
  So, make her hear from you. 
  Fight for your relationship. 
  You know this is Kia all over again. 
  Kia broke up with me because I was Because she thought you didn't trust her. 
  And now it's happening again with Leila. 
  And the sad part is, it ain't even about them. 
  So, what, you psychic now? 
  No, I ain't no psychic, and I ain't gotta be to figure out who this really about. 
  Look, your pops left, so, anything approaching love, yeah, I said "love," you push that person away because you expect them to leave you, too, and now you using this Asher thing to do it all over again with Leila. 
  Look, just because you left Crenshaw and got your anger in check don't mean you ain't take your demons with you. 
  All right, well, what, I love you. 
  How come I ain't never try to push you away? 
  The hell you didn't. 
  Heh. 
  Every day in fourth grade. 
  You just lucky I ain't budge. 
  COOP: You know why? 
  - SPENCER: Why? 
  - 'Cause I love you. 
  I love you, too, Coop. 
  - I love you more. 
  - You better get your ass down. 
  - Or what? 
  - Look, that's not safe, man. 
  Coop. 
  Hey, Liv. 
  Jordan, um I'm so sorry I ratted you out last night. 
  Actually, I came to apologize. 
  For not ratting you out. 
  Look, Liv, I knew you were using, OK, a lot, and I didn't say anything about it. 
  I guess I thought I was being a good brother by covering for you. 
  Maybe if I would've said something sooner, - you wouldn't have - You'd probably still have found me passed out after the party. 
  I was so far gone. 
  You scared me to death that day, Liv. 
  OK, and maybe that's why I tried to forget it ever happened, but it did. 
  And none of us should forget that. 
  Congratulations for making it one year sober, by the way. 
  [CHUCKLES] 
  You did you did make it, right? 
  Ha ha! 
  You busy tonight? 
  Not anymore. 
  [LAUGHTER] 
  Serious. 
  She didn't care if she split her pants down the middle. 
  Tamia She just kept dancing. 
  SPENCER: Oh. 
  I remember that. 
  That's what you get for trying to do the split. 
  Hey, man, listen. 
  Us Coopers take our dance-offs very seriously. 
  Heh. 
  Ain't that right, Ma? 
  So, how's your mother, Spencer? 
  SPENCER: Yeah, she's good. 
  Busy, you know. 
  Work and Dillon and night school now. 
  Well, you tell her if she needs any help with Dillon, - I'm here. 
  - I'm down to help, too. 
  - SPENCER: Yeah, I know. 
  - COOP: Oh. 
  [PHONE CHIMING] 
  [SILVERWARE CLATTERING ON PLATE] 
  SPENCER: You all right, miss Janelle? 
  I can't do this. 
  I-I can't do this. 
  It's not the daughter I raised. 
  SPENCER: Yes, she is. 
  What's wrong with y'all? 
  Coop is still Coop. 
  So, it wasn't enough to break my heart the first time? 
  You had to bring me back to do it again? 
  Baby girl, that's not what's happening here. 
  Look, I'm sorry, Tamia, but I believe what I believe, and nobody, not your father or your friend Tyrone, is gonna make me feel any different. 
  Tyrone? 
  What's he got to do with it? 
  - Janelle, don't do this. 
  - No, I'm not gonna live a lie in my own home, Reggie. 
  The only reason that you are here today is because Tyrone's got the hookup at your father's truck company, and if your father didn't bring you home, he'd lose his job. 
  You worse than Ma. 
  You let me hope things would be different. 
  You know what? 
  I'm dope as hell, and y'all gonna realize that one day. 
  The messed-up part? 
  It's probably gonna be too late. 
  MAN: I'm stressed out, sippin' this I sussed out living, now I'm chilling with my team And the dream, to be sure, is winning I'm not skidding in the beamer but believe it's the beginning Life will turn around on you so fast your head is spinning Hey, my bad. 
  Thought I'd have the place to myself. 
  SPENCER: No, I'm done. 
  It's all you. 
  Hey, Spencer, you were a friend to me when you had no reason to be. 
  You helped me with that crazy situation with the Porsche and you didn't blow my cover. 
  I'd like to return the favor with some advice. 
  I'm listening. 
  Don't make the same mistake as I did and lose the best thing that's ever happened to you. 
  I know this is gonna sound crazy coming from me but you can trust Leila. 
  That don't sound crazy at all, man. 
  I know I can trust Leila. 
  The person I wasn't trusting was myself. 
  You know, you and me ain't all that different. 
  And I think I can help you get back in with the team. 
  Pretty sure that ship has already sailed, bro. 
  We gonna need some new plays to go up against Logan, all right? 
  Coach said so himself. 
  So, if you got time, I don't know. 
  Maybe we can go out on the field. 
  See what we come up with. 
  Maybe bring something back that actually helps the team. 
  Yeah. 
  WOMAN: La-da-da, da-da, da-da-da-da ASHER: I got the time. 
  [CLATTERING] 
  WOMAN: I swear to God it's almost every night You and I, we begin to fly I'm not letting you in. 
  Look, I need you to understand. 
  Tyrone ain't the reason I brought you back home. 
  That was always the plan. 
  But I knew your mom needed more time. 
  Tyrone threatening my job, that just made it easier for me to force your mom's hand. 
  That's the only reason I went along with it. 
  You really expect me to believe you weren't - just trying to keep your job? 
  - I quit my job this morning. 
  But you love that job. 
  I'd rather lose a job than lose my daughter. 
  My emancipation papers? 
  Printed out new ones. 
  Your mom and I signed them. 
  We're giving you what you want so you can keep a roof over your head. 
  Now, those are just papers. 
  You're still my daughter. 
  And I ain't gonna stop fighting till I reunite my family. 
  WOMAN: Is it over? 
  Is it over? 
  SPENCER: I should've been honest with you, that Asher moving in was triggering stuff for me. 
  Triggering? 
  There's a therapy word for you. 
  Yeah, well, I ain't got a therapist, but I got Coop, and instead of telling you the truth, that I don't want Asher living here, and trusting that we can have that conversation and it not end with you leaving me, I lied. 
  I made it about everything else and let it build up until I snapped, and that wasn't fair on you. 
  Why would you think you couldn't be honest with me about your feelings? 
  That I'd leave just because we had a difference in opinion? 
  - Look. 
  - Your your dad. 
  It's because he left. 
  It's crazy. 
  After all these years, he's still got that kind of hold on me. 
  Hey, I'm not going anywhere. 
  There are a lot of us who aren't going anywhere. 
  The fact that your dad left doesn't have anything to do with who you are and everything to do with who he is. 
  You're amazing and kind and frustrating. 
  You're a good person, Spencer, and an incredibly easy person to love. 
  Trust that. 
  I'm working on it. 
  We'll work on it together. 
  Yeah. 
  WOMAN: Ohh Ohh Ooh I love you, too. 
  WOMAN: Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh KODALINE: It's harder to see through the eyes of a stranger It's easy to love when the world doesn't hate ya When you trying to send out but nobody hears a word It's safer to swim when the tide's not against ya Liv, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey. 
  Hey, come on, come on, hey, come on. 
  Somebody, Mom, somebody, hey, hey, hey, come here, come here, Mom, Dad. 
  LAURA: What's going on? 
  What happened?

  JORDAN: Woke up and she was like this LAURA: What were you doing? 
  JORDAN: We KODALINE: I'll shed a tear for you Get the water. 
  Open your eyes, I'm by your side I'm never leaving you Darkness to light, stay through the night I'm walking in your shoes Do you know that it's the truth When nobody's here for you Let me make it clear Olivia. 
  Shed a tear, shed a tear, shed a tear, shed a tear We celebrate your honesty and your commitment to yourself and the ones you love, and we commemorate this day with your one-year sobriety medallion. 
  KODALINE: I'll take the blame You did it. 
  [APPLAUSE] 
  KODALINE: Open your eyes, I'm by your side - [CROWD CHEERING] 
  - I'm never leaving you Darkness or light, stay through the night I'm walking in your shoes So you know that it's I thought you guys had plans.

  You know, we already went through this with Olivia. 
  And handled it poorly. 
  Yeah, I know, but this is this isn't the same things. 
  We already know Olivia has an addictive personality. 
  How do we know that that's not the case for Jordan, too? 
  My point is, is that we're supposed to be together. 
  We're supposed to be partners. 
  You're right. 
  You're right. 
  We need to be honest with each other, no matter the cost. 
  Yeah. 
  No matter the cost. 
  There's a little bit more to the story. 
  I, uh I-I did something that, uh, that I can't take back, and if it gets out, not only could it cost me my job, it could compromise your your campaign and Jordan's eligibility. 
  What did you do, Billy? 
  I swapped out Jordan's urine sample at a drug test. 
  He was gonna fail, and I just wanted to protect our son. 
  [EXHALES] 
  I know. 
  OK. 
  OK. 
  We'll figure this out together. 
  MAN: Greg, move your head
