  Here. 
  I'll add in studio time with my dad. 
  Look, if you win, you got to give her all that money back, all right? 
  Things have been kind of different with you lately. 
  Look, I need to go. 
  I want to be alone tonight. 
  - Layla - Damn it, Spencer. 
  Just get out of my car. 
  You know, I tried calling and texting, I mean, a few times, but I never heard back. 
  My life got a little complicated. 
  You know, you could have just told me that instead of ghosting me, right? 
  It's OK. 
  Look, um, I'm glad to see you're doing well. 
  Take care. 
  I'm choosing you to be my father, not my coach. 
  I I just want to be your son. 
  And I don't want football getting in the way of that. 
  Take it to the house, baby! 
  Whoo! 
  Man. 
  Who got the wild mom? 
  You got this! 
  Whoo! 
  Yo, I'm fixing to dog you. 
  Wait. 
  What? 
  Yeah, I can't hear you. 
  Your moms and her friends making too much noise. 
  Take it to the house, baby. 
  - Hike! 
  - Whoo! 
  You got this, baby. 
  Dang. 
  You got speed. 
  You, too. 
  Thought you had me. 
  What's your name? 
  Corey James. 
  I'm Billy Baker. 
  OK, baby! 
  Whoo! 
  Is that your mom? 
  Yeah. 
  Come to all your games? 
  Every one. 
  She cool, I guess. 
  Good game, Billy Baker. 
  I'll win the next one. 
  Hurry up, little man. 
  We got to go. 
  OK! 
  Well, since when does it take him longer than Spencer to get ready? 
  Since girls at school started calling. 
  Where did the time go? 
  Don't ask me. 
  I'm still trying to figure out how my 25-year reunion is this weekend. 
  Ooh! 
  OK. 
  So who you taking? 
  - To the reunion? 
  - Yes! 
  Spencer and Dillon are coming with me to the barbecue. 
  No. 
  I'm talking about the night thing. 
  Ain't there gonna be a DJ, drinks? 
  Yeah. 
  Dancing? 
  Probably. 
  I'm just saying, you cannot be the single lady at the reunion looking thirsty. 
  Uh, I'm not gonna look thirsty. 
  Yeah, if you bring someone. 
  What's up with Micah? 
  Hit that boy up. 
  I ain't seen him in a minute. 
  Oh, Micah met someone. 
  You got canceled, too? 
  Yo, who canceled you, bro? 
  Cherie. 
  For the record, Micah did not cancel me. 
  He just moved on. 
  With who? 
  I didn't ask. 
  How you even know it's that serious? 
  Uh, are you taking Dillon, or should I? 
  Ha ha! 
  Yeah, I'm taking him. 
  Come on, bro. 
  Ugh. 
  Later. 
  Wow. 
  25 years? 
  Crazy, right? 
  You ever wonder what we're gonna be in 25 years? 
  I don't even know what I'm going to be doing tomorrow. 
  Heh! 
  You're still coming, right? 
  To the reunion barbecue? 
  Isn't that just for families? 
  Yeah, but my pops is gonna be there. 
  You all ain't spend no time together, and I want that to change. 
  - OK. 
  - OK. 
  Come on. 
  We gonna be late. 
  Oh, I'll I'll just drop you at school. 
  You skipping again? 
  I'm just not feeling it today. 
  Layla, I got to ask you something. 
  Yeah? 
  What are you gonna do today? 
  I don't know. 
  Maybe I'll go see a psychic and see where I'll be in 25 years. 
  All right. 
  Well, you want some company? 
  Don't need a babysitter. 
  I know. 
  You're not the only one who could use a day off. 
  Just no psychics, though, please. 
  Cool. 
  - Please? 
  - No! 
  Ma? 
  I already gave you your phone back, Jordan. 
  I am not giving you your car keys. 
  OK, fine. 
  Can I at least use the account to order a ride? 
  Look, I have I have a thing tomorrow night. 
  Does this thing have a name? 
  It's not a date. 
  What part of "grounded" is confusing? 
  Look, Cara doesn't have a car, all right? 
  And I told her I'd help her out. 
  Am I not allowed to help out a friend in need? 
  I'm sorry, Jordan. 
  I didn't realize how hard it is to be you right now. 
  Thank you. 
  So was that a yes? 
  Nope. 
  Stop asking. 
  What, you got something witty to say? 
  Yes, I do, but I'm going to keep it to myself. 
  And I also have a solution to your complicated dating life. 
  I'm listening. 
  Go with me to dad's reunion barbecue tomorrow. 
  Won't grace James be there? 
  The whole day will just be a huge reminder of what happened. 
  My car tomorrow night. 
  Just go to the reunion and hang out with dad. 
  You're bribing me. 
  Yes. 
  Yeah. 
  I'll be there. 
  Good morning, Asher. 
  Hey, dad. 
  You look good. 
  I feel good. 
  Got some big news. 
  - Yeah? 
  - Nope. 
  Never mind. 
  I don't want to jinx it. 
  But if everything works out, it's gonna be big news for both of us. 
  That's great. 
  I, uh, better get to school. 
  Who was on the phone? 
  Mom. 
  I was surprised to hear from her. 
  It's been, like, a year. 
  She asked to meet for lunch tomorrow. 
  Said she had something important she wanted to talk to me about. 
  Well, I guess everyone has big news. 
  That movie sucked. 
  They need to just stop remaking remakes. 
  Do you have any snacks? 
  Uh, we probably shouldn't stay long. 
  Isn't your mom at work? 
  Yeah, but if she comes home early and catches us skipping The fun of skipping is the danger of getting caught. 
  Wait, wait, wait. 
  I need to ask you something. 
  OK. 
  Layla, I seen the cuts on your arm. 
  Wait. 
  What? 
  - Layla, if you hurting yourself - Are you serious? 
  That's why you skipped, so you could ambush me. 
  - I just thought - No. 
  Maybe don't think so much, Spencer. 
  I cannot believe you. 
  I'm out. 
  And I'm not going to your barbecue thing. 
  Layla, wait. 
  What No. 
  Just so you know, these cuts are from my bracelets. 
  OK, OK, I'm sorry. 
  I shouldn't have jumped to conclusions. 
  I guess I'm just still getting used to this new version of you. 
  It's not a version of me. 
  It's me. 
  Maybe you should be more worried about this version of you. 
  So you believe her? 
  I don't know what to believe. 
  Well, I did hear somebody say that them rodeo drive bracelets is way more dangerous that what we got over here at Crenshaw. 
  Look, I ain't saying she lying, but even if she not cutting herself, she's still acting like nothing matters. 
  And I don't think it's just some Beverly Hills emo phase. 
  Maybe I should call her pops. 
  You don't think I should. 
  Take it from somebody who everyone thinks is a snitch. 
  And say you do make the call and there's nothing wrong. 
  Layla is never gonna forgive you. 
  - And I could lose her. 
  - Yeah. 
  So maybe you can hang out with her. 
  Man, what? 
  Come on. 
  Don't put me in that You trying to write songs, right? 
  That's something she loves. 
  Maybe she can help you. 
  All right, man. 
  I hit her up. 
  But I'm not spying on your girl, dog. 
  I heard that. 
  Corey James, is that you? 
  Denise Rivers? 
  It's Denise Patterson now. 
  But don't you worry. 
  I'm single. 
  - OK. 
  - Here's your badge. 
  - All right. 
  - Oh.

  It was his decision. 
  He made it.

  I got canceled by a girl. 
  For real?

  I was just thinking maybe we should make some plans. 
  I'm staying in Beverly so that we can focus on us as a family. 
  Get to know each other again. 
  Just tell me when and where. 
  I was hoping you'd have some ideas. 
  We can go fishing.

  We're both single, we're both looking. 
  I am not looking. 
  There's going to be plenty of fish in the sea. 
  So why don't we just let each other know who we have our eyes on and then we don't step on each other's toes. 
  You know, I'm I'm bringing a date.

  Liv, all I'm saying is when was the last time you got your car washed? 
  My car's not dirty, and you're lucky to have a car at all. 
  Move. 
  Look, I'm making a sacrifice, too, all right? 
  - I don't even want to be here. 
  - Jordan, I know how you feel. 
  I do. 
  But dad is all alone right now, and he needs us. 
  So could you please just, like, pretend like you're happy to see him? 
  Wait. 
  Here he comes. 
  Smile. 
  Hey. 
  You guys came. 
  I didn't think that you'd, uh We wouldn't miss it, right, Jordan?

  Uh, come. 
  I want to introduce you to a couple of my old teammates. 
  Cool? 
  Come on.

  - Uh, I'll be right there. 
  - All right. 
  Cool. 
  Hey. 
  I thought you were bringing Layla. 
  Yeah. 
  Me, too. 
  Kind of had a fight. 
  I asked a question, and she left. 
  What did you ask her? 
  I seen some cuts on her arm. 
  Thought she might be hurting herself. 
  I'm just worried about her. 
  Spencer, there was never a second break-in at her house. 
  What are you talking about? 
  Layla trashed her own house, and I've seen depression, and there are definitely signs there. 
  I don't know what she's going through, but something's not right with her. 
  This is really good, Coop. 
  Yeah. 
  But it's incomplete. 
  OK. 
  So finish it. 
  That's the problem. 
  Like, everything comes out so natural, and then I get stuck. 
  And the rest just seems forced. 
  OK. 
  So just walk away. 
  I can't just keep starting over on songs. 
  No. 
  Literally, like, walk away. 
  Take a Take a long walk and clear your head. 
  Anyway How have you been? 
  I'm good. 
  Ha ha. 
  I'm really good, actually. 
  I'm just embracing the new me. 
  I get it. 
  You know, just keeping it real. 
  Spencer calling for a full report? 
  Nah. 
  That's That's not it. 
  Um, I asked you here because I'm stuck. 
  And I could really use your help. 
  That's all. 
  You hiding from Denise Rivers? 
  Heh. 
  It's Patterson now. 
  I just wanted to say thank you. 
  For what? 
  Spencer seems really happy with the way your relationship is going. 
  You mentioned clipper tickets? 
  Ha ha. 
  You OK, Corey? 
  Yeah. 
  I'm good. 
  Something came up. 
  I got to get out of here early. 
  OK. 
  You still coming to the dance, though, tonight, right? 
  I'll be there. 
  Save me a dance. 
  - Hey. 
  Sorry I'm late. 
  - Hey. 
  Why am I so nervous? 
  It's been a year. 
  I'm sure she's just as nervous as you. 
  Hey, baby. 
  Mom. 
  You remember Olivia? 
  Yes. 
  Uh, Jordan's sister, right? 
  Wait. 
  Are you two? 
  - No. 
  - No. 
  Oh. 
  Well, that's too bad. 
  You look cute together. 
  Please sit. 
  Sit. 
  Tell me everything. 
  About what? 
  Well, your life. 
  You want to know about my life? 
  Maybe I should No, no, no. 
  I want you to stay. 
  It's been a year, mom. 
  I know. 
  So why now? 
  What changed? 
  I wish I could tell you. 
  But just know that I have missed you every day. 
  Asher said that you have some news. 
  Yes. 
  Ahem. 
  Um, Jacob, my boyfriend, proposed. 
  We're getting married. 
  Wow. 
  That's a beautiful ring, Gwen. 
  Thank you, Olivia. 
  Asher? 
  What? 
  Aren't you gonna say anything? 
  About the ring? 
  About the engagement Me and Jacob. 
  Mom, I don't even know Jacob. 
  I know. 
  But that's going to change. 
  Are we done here? 
  - Asher - Look, mom You wanted to tell me your big news, and now I know. 
  Look, that's not the reason why I asked you here. 
  I can't marry Jacob until your father and I are officially divorced. 
  And Harold keeps avoiding the divorce papers. 
  I've tried to serve him 8 times, but Wait. 
  What are you asking him to do? 
  Well, I'm hoping That you'll serve Harold with these divorce papers. 
  Finalizing this is the best thing for everybody, including your father. 
  Just think about it. 
  OK? 
  I love you, baby. 
  You feel old yet? 
  Do I look old? 
  Not as old as some of your classmates. 
  That's my boy. 
  - Hey, Billy B. 
  - Hey, now. 
  I'll see you tonight, right? 
  - She's thirsty. 
  - Yeah. 
  Don't worry. 
  I won't tell mom. 
  Tell mom what? 
  - Ah, ha ha. 
  - Ha ha! 
  You got jokes. 
  Ahh. 
  I miss this, man. 
  You and me. 
  And I know. 
  I know. 
  I know. 
  We got a long way to go, but, uh, but we'll get there. 
  Can I give you a ride? 
  Uh, no. 
  I got, uh, I got Liv's car. 
  Does your mother know about that? 
  No. 
  Um, are you gonna tell her? 
  - Jordan. 
  - Come on, dad. 
  We've been having a good time today, right? 
  Give me a break on this one, please? 
  Any distraction is good when you're stuck. 
  The key is you just can't force it. 
  So now just see what words pop into your head. 
  OK. 
  I will give that a try. 
  OK. 
  Um, I'm gonna get going. 
  OK. 
  Hey, today was cool. 
  I appreciate you coming through. 
  You're welcome. 
  That's, like, your tenth missed call, Coop. 
  So what? 
  I'm popular today. 
  I know it's Spencer. 
  Look, he cares about you. 
  OK. 
  So he set this whole thing up? 
  No. 
  I honestly just think he's worried. 
  - What's up, ladies? 
  - Go away. 
  Yo, deuce, this is bad timing. 
  I ain't going nowhere till little miss Beverly Hills here gives me that studio time with J. P. Keating. 
  What did you just call me? 
  You owe me, and I'mma get mine. 
  Believe that. 
  Are you threatening me? 
  You think my dad is gonna waste his time with some weak-ass, needy M. C. ? 
  - Hey, Layla, chill. 
  - Now you disrespecting me. 
  Why don't you just do something about it or get up out of my face, hmm? 
  That's what I thought. 
  All talk. 
  All right. 
  You all go back doing what y'all was doing. 
  I appreciate your concern. 
  - Micah, hi. 
  - Hey. 
  Thanks for coming. 
  Uh, your message said it was urgent. 
  But I'm guessing you don't need help with an assignment. 
  You have the highest grade in the class. 
  I do? 
  Probably shouldn't have told you that. 
  Ha ha! 
  Uh, what do you need? 
  A favor. 
  Would you mind if we sit? 
  Am I in trouble? 
  - No, you're fine. 
  - Ha ha! 
  All right. 
  You're fine. 
  What's the favor? 
  Um, my 25-year reunion is tonight. 
  Oh. 
  And, uh, you don't want to be the single lady at the party looking thirsty. 
  I am not gonna be looking thirsty! 
  Ha ha! 
  Hey, I'm joking. 
  I'm kidding, OK? 
  Ha ha! 
  No. 
  Hey, look, if you need a date, you got one. 
  Come on. 
  We're still friends, right? 
  Right. 
  Friends. 
  Ha ha. 
  Why can't we go to your house? 
  My mom's home. 
  What about yours? 
  Same. 
  We could always just pull over, get in the back seat. 
  Um, it's my sister's car. 
  So? 
  Who keeps blowing you up? 
  Who the hell is Simone? 
  Nobody. 
  Give me Give me my phone. 
  - No. 
  - Give me Give me my phone. 
  - Why don't you make me? 
  - Oh, shoot! 
  Oh, no, no, no, no! 
  Oh, no, no, no. 
  Wait. 
  No. 
  Aah! 
  You OK? 
  Yes. 
  Better than your sister's car. 
  I'm so dead. 
  We should probably get out of here. 
  Yeah, but we can't just leave my sister's car here. 
  You can stay. 
  Say hi to Simone. 
  Hey. 
  Hey. 
  You heard from Layla? 
  No. 
  I mean, I left her a couple messages. 
  Why? 
  What's going on? 
  She was hanging out with Coop today and lost it on some dude. 
  Lost it? 
  Just picking fights she should not have been picking, all right? 
  And I don't know where she is. 
  I think I have an idea. 
  Just give me one second. 
  This was my jam in junior high. 
  Ha ha! 
  Great. 
 
 
 
  Thanks. 
  As if I didn't feel old enough already today. 
  Don't worry. 
  You still got it. 
  Oh, I know I do. 
  My 20-year reunion was last year. 
  Ah, they're all the same. 
  Just, "how you been?" "What you been up to?"  
  - Generic conversation. 
  - Yeah. 
  How you been? 
  What have you been up to? 
  So this is what our relationship has come to? 
  Maybe I should get us, um, something to drink. 
  25 years. 
  Can you believe it? 
  Most of it seems like a lifetime ago. 
  And then some things feel like they just happened yesterday. 
  You miss it? 
  Some of it. 
  You? 
  You know, there were some good memories, but, uh But the bad ones stay with us. 
  Things that need to be said, Billy. 
  Hey. 
  Hey. 
  Any word on that big news? 
  No. 
  I was waiting to hear about a job offer. 
  Sure sounded to me like I was gonna get it. 
  Don't jinx it, Dad. 
  Ha ha! 
  What was your mom's big news? 
  She's marrying Jacob. 
  How did you know? 
  Unlucky guess. 
  What are you doing, Asher? 
  I am serving you with these divorce papers. 
  I'm sorry. 
  She's gone, Dad. 
  It's time for you to let her go. 
  All that matters is that we have each other and we're doing OK, right? 
  I'll always be here for you. 
  I'm not going anywhere. 
  When did you sneak in? 
  A while ago. 
  Just been busy taking photos of Billy with all his fans. 
  They do love him here. 
  That man casts a very big shadow. 
  You'll be fine. 
  Win a few games. 
  What's going on with you, Corey? 
  Hey! 
  Where all my single fellas at? 
  Hey, OK, I see you. 
  I see You. 
  Hello! 
  Ha ha. 
  OK. 
  As Class President, they've asked me to make a special announcement tonight. 
  We are honoring a former classmate who put South Crenshaw high on the map, OK? 
  Are you kidding me? 
  We all remember his amazing mother as the best history teacher this school has ever seen, Mrs. B? 
  Mrs. B, you know! 
  Ha ha! 
  So So to get him up on stage, we have a tribute to his amazing mama. 
  Let's bring up to the stage South Crenshaw high's favorite son and only NFL star, still looking fine as ever, Billy Baker. 
  Whoo! 
  Get up here! 
  Are you gonna say something? 
  Mom? 
  Mom? 
  OK. 
  You're starting to scare me. 
  Good. 
  Sit. 
  You mind if I stand? 
  You will sit. 
  I will stand. 
  I will ask the questions, and you will provide the answers. 
  You will tell me the whole truth and nothing but the truth, so help you, God. 
  I feel like I'm in Court. 
  You are in my court. 
  Did I or did I not suspend your driving privileges? 
  - Mom. 
  - Answer the question. 
  Yes. 
  OK. 
  I wasn't supposed to drive. 
  And yet somehow, you managed to crash your sister's car into our neighbor's front yard. 
  Is that a question? 
  You are grounded for as long as I can legally ground you for. 
  And your birthday party next weekend, canceled. 
  Everything is canceled.

  Your pops won't train me no more? 
  I mean, what's wrong? 
  Am I stealing your headlines? 
  You got to be the star? 
  I am the star, Corey. 
  And you've always been the jealous sidekick who can never beat me. 
  What about Grace? 
  Who'd she choose? 
  I cut her loose, so you should be thanking me. 
  Watch yourself, Corey, or I might change my mind and take her back. 
  Things need to be said. 
  I'm listening. 
  Billy Baker Field? 
  Still jealous after all these years. 
  I ain't never been jealous of Billy Baker in my life. 
  Well, then get over it, Corey. 
  It ain't my fault you quit football. 
  You don't know what you're talking about.

  I got sick. 
  Had to take a year off to beat it, which I did. 
  No, I didn't do it for Grace. 
  And when I tried to return to football, it was too late. 
  I'd lost that second gear. 
  It was all gone. 
  Wh Why didn't you tell me?
