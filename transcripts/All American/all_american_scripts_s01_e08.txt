 Previously on "All American" What you doing? 
  Collecting my paper. 
  Alvin know about this? 
  Nah. 
  nobody gonna Rob Alvin. 
  We ain't here for no haircut, but we definitely gonna take a cut. 
  There's a lot of heat on us right now 'cause that mess you made at Alvin's. 
  So, now you gonna take over and sell our dope on his block. 
  No problem. 
  Don't worry. 
  I got you, all right? 
  Tyrone, he'll never know. 
  I told Shawn that I would handle it. 
  - This is on me. 
  - I don't carry nobody, so, you and your boy Shawn, watch your back. 
  I'm so sorry. 
  It's not gonna work anymore. 
  Tell her, Olivia. 
  Tell your best friend how we had s*x way before Spencer showed up on the scene. 
  I'm suspending you for the next two games. 
  Tomorrow's homecoming. 
  Scouts are gonna be at that game. 
  I have to play. 
  Please do not do this to me. 
  What do you say? 
  I need to book it home or my dad's gonna kill me. 
  Yeah, and I say that you just need to loosen up. 
  Aren't you always tired of doing what's right? 
  Listen, I know your feelings for Asher won't just go away because you got feelings for me. 
  As much as I want to be with you right now And, believe me, I do The last thing you need is anything complicated. 
  Some ride you got. 
  You're here. 
  Damn right I'm here. 
  So, what happened with that thing you had to take care of tonight? 
  Getting Shawn from out under the gang and all? 
  Some things, hmm, just don't work out as you had planned. 
  What's up with you and your girl, though? 
  How'd that work out? 
  Like you said. 
  Some things don't work out like we plan. 
  Hell of a night, right? 
  You're telling me. 
  You sure you're good? 
  As good as it gets. 
  I want better for you, Coop. 
  You're my people. 
  All right? 
  You're family to me. 
  I'm not ever gonna leave you behind. 
  No matter what. 
  I know you won't. 
  Oh, that boy's a mess. 
  Tell me about it. 
  Tell your best friend how we had s*x way before Spencer showed up on the scene. 
  Tell her! 
  Go ahead! 
  How many times y'all gonna watch that damn video? 
  Enough. 
  Come on! 
  Mom, it's epic. 
  What's wrong, baby? 
  It's my fault. 
  Your fault? 
  Look, if I never left south Crenshaw, never upped and moved to Beverly Hills, none of this mess would've happened. 
  How is that exactly? 
  If I'd have stayed, Coop wouldn't be caught up with Shawn and a bunch of gangbangers. 
  Jordan and coach wouldn't be struggling to connect all the time, and Asher wouldn't be benched for homecoming. 
  And he'd still have a girlfriend. 
  Thanks for the input, little man. 
  Just calling it how I see it. 
  You cannot take the blame for other people's choices. 
  I made a lot of bad choices in my life, and I own them. 
  They don't belong to nobody else. 
  But this choice going to Beverly You made the right decision for you, for your future. 
  That's all any one of us can control. 
  Right, baby? 
  You know as well as I do that the Eagles need Asher on that field tonight. 
  There's no way he's riding the Bench for this game. 
  Harold, I don't like sitting out my starting wide receiver on homecoming, either. 
  It puts me at a disadvantage, a disadvantage that I cannot afford. 
  But your son, he was drinking on school property. 
  Made a big scene at the dance last night, and there are consequences for that. 
  Is that right? 
  I'm afraid it is. 
  I'm not gonna let this stand. 
  You mark my words, you're gonna regret it. 
  Your dad's an ass. 
  Huh. 
  What was that about? 
  I'll tell you later. 
  Where the hell have you been? 
  Out. 
  Are you high right now? 
  What? 
  No. 
  In case you're forgetting, I know what high as a kite looks like. 
  Are you nuts? 
  You have a game today. 
  Olivia, relax. 
  Relax? 
  Dude, I covered for you. 
  I told mom and dad that you were in your room all night. 
  Now get your chip-guzzling walk of shame butt upstairs before Ah. 
  What's going on here? 
  - Hey, dad. 
  - Hey. 
  Why are you still in your suit? 
  And where are your shoes? 
  Hey, please do not tell me you are just getting in from last night. 
  You know you know what? 
  I had a great night. 
  I I finally let loose for once. 
  You let loose. 
  I would stop now. 
  No. 
  No, no, no, no. 
  I'm I'm not gonna stop, OK? 
  I'm always trying to do what's right. 
  I'm always trying to please you. 
  - Please me? 
  - Yeah, you. 
  And for once, I did what I wanted. 
  What, with this little Malibu cheerleader? 
  Her name is Ripley, dad. 
  Do you think that she even cares that you're gonna be distracted at tonight's game? 
  Do you think she cares that you're gonna be off because your ass was out all night coming up in here barefooted and Doe-eyed just hours before kickoff? 
  She's a high school girl, OK? 
  She's not a secret agent. 
  I don't give a look. 
  I know this. 
  I know you're team captain. 
  You are supposed to be leading your players. 
  You got responsibilities here, Jack. 
  Do you not want them? 
  Because if you don't, please just let me know. 
  Jordan, you have to figure out what's important to you. 
  Not for me, not for these girls. 
  Baby, for you. 
  So, please figure it out. 
  What's it gonna be this morning, mama? 
  Want your eggs scrambled? 
  I like mines over easy. 
  I was talking to Maya. 
  You can make your own damn eggs, fool. 
  Hey, man, you're not really just gonna walk away from that job with J. P. , are you? 
  I mean, you can't just give up, not like this. 
  That's the problem with you and your boy Spencer. 
  You think life's like some damn fairy tale, like we all got some chance at greatness. 
  But that's not how the world work for the rest of us. 
  Look, it don't have to be that way, Shawn. 
  You can't just up and throw away your dream. 
  No use dreaming when the dreams ain't real. 
  Sometimes the dream is all we got. 
  Open the door. 
  Are you expecting somebody? 
  No. 
  Open the door. 
  Go play. 
  What's up, Ty? 
  What you doing here? 
  Just stopping by. 
  Is that a problem? 
  Nah, man. 
  My crib is your crib. 
  Yeah, I got some eggs cooking. 
  You want some? 
  Nah, I'm good. 
  Hey, little lady. 
  I got something for you. 
  - Aww! 
  - Aww. 
  You like kittens? 
  All little girls like kittens, right? 
  Ain't that right? 
  It's kitty! 
  We got a problem. 
  The cops been asking about our boy that got popped at Alvin's That heat you brought. 
  So, until that clears up, we on lockdown. 
  You feel me? 
  Yeah, I'm feeling you. 
  Get your girl some eggs, man. 
  Take care of your baby girl, Shawn. 
  - Eggs. 
  - Yeah. 
  We'll be right back. 
  Remember what I told you. 
  You and Shawn. 
  Y'all better watch your back, because if you ain't riding for me, I'm coming for y'all You and Shawn. 
  Well, here he is Tyrone Moore. 
  It says he's associated with one of the most dangerous gangs in south L. 
  A. 
  How on earth did you get caught up with a guy like this? 
  It's a long story. 
  Look, Coop and Shawn, they need protection. 
  They in a bad spot, Mrs. 
  Baker. 
  Guys like Tyrone, they don't mess around. 
  I don't know who else to turn to. 
  No, I'm glad you came to me, Spencer. 
  I think I might be able to help. 
  Look, I'm gonna have to make a couple of phone calls, but it says here that the D. A. 
  's office has been after Tyrone for quite some time. 
  If you have any information that could help with that, I'm sure I can get them to negotiate some sort of deal so that No, no, no. 
  I don't know nothing about Tyrone. 
  But Shawn does, right? 
  You know he not going for that. 
  Maybe not, but it's worth a shot, man. 
  Come on. 
  OK, look, if you can convince this Shawn guy to cooperate, I can get both of you the help you need. 
  I promise you that. 
  Look, we both said some pretty harsh things last night, and I am still mad as hell at you. 
  I am sorry that I slept with Asher, and I will keep saying it until I get it. 
  You were high. 
  But I'm still really hurt, and not just about the Asher thing. 
  I'm upset about us. 
  You let me believe you didn't want to be my friend anymore, and you let me be with a guy who would cheat on me with my best friend. 
  I know. 
  And it was wrong. 
  I told myself that I was doing it to protect you, but the truth is, I was just protecting myself. 
  Everything that you said last night was true. 
  Well if I'm being honest, you weren't wrong, either. 
  I knew you liked Spencer, and I was too afraid of not being miss perfect to admit I liked him, too. 
  I'm sorry. 
  You you don't need to apologize, Leila, OK? 
  Not to me, not after what I did. 
  And yes, I had a thing for Spencer, but I'm moving on, and Spencer is a really good guy for you. 
  Yeah, well He's a really good guy who's trying to uncomplicate my life by saying we should just be friends right now. 
  Probably for the best. 
  Is it? 
  I don't know. 
  What about us? 
  I really don't want to lose my best friend again. 
  Honestly, um I don't know about that, either. 
  It's gonna take some time. 
  Look, Harold Adams is kicking up a storm with the board, the boosters. 
  Look, I'm gonna tell you exactly what I told him. 
  We have a responsibility here, not just to win but to teach these young boys how to be better humans. 
  If I let Ash back out on that field tonight after what he did, I mean, what kind of a lesson are we teaching them? 
  Look, I agree with you. 
  I'm in your corner, Billy. 
  But you have to know, if you don't play Asher Adams and you lose tonight, the board will Yeah, I know, I know. 
  They'll fire me next season. 
  Look, I don't want to see that happen. 
  But my hands are kind of tied here. 
  If I give in to this, to parents like Harold Adams, and put winning above these kids' best interest, then what kind of coach does that make me? 
  Have you lost your damn mind? 
  Man, Tyrone is coming for us, Shawn. 
  He said it hisself. 
  This is a way out. 
  The lady said she could protect us. 
  I don't need no protection. 
  Come on, Shawn. 
  Look, this ain't just about you, all right? 
  Getting a guy like Tyrone off the streets is gonna protect this whole community. 
  I ain't no snitch. 
  I got a code. 
  What good is that gonna do for you? 
  You seem to forget how things work down here now that you cashed your golden ticket, Beverly. 
  Ratting on your own will get you laid out. 
  And living this life won't? 
  You been fronting like I had talent and you didn't since we was kids, but you chose to roll with guys like Tyrone. 
  Choose something else now, man. 
  Why do you even care? 
  I don't. 
  But I care about Coop. 
  And she thinks you deserve a chance at something more, so, you can take my help or not. 
  That's up to you. 
  I'll find my own way out. 
  Shawn. 
  Shawn. 
  I got this. 
  Look, you can't beat yourself up, all right? 
  You did the right thing. 
  You tried. 
  Shawn made his choice. 
  All right? 
  He made it when we was kids, and he made it again today. 
  Look, how many times have you given me the big Tamia Cooper speech about not being able to save the world, how I gotta save myself first? 
  You're always telling me I gotta take my shot, Coop, make something of myself. 
  And I was right. 
  So, when are you gonna realize that you deserve that chance, too? 
  You could be so much more than this, Coop. 
  How is it you can't see that? 
  I guess it's just easier to see it in other people. 
  I see it in you, all right? 
  Time to start seeing it in yourself now. 
  Ha! 
  Wow. 
  So, your dad was really that mad? 
  Yeah. 
  Billy Baker takes his football very, very seriously. 
  You said he played in the NFL? 
  Yeah, until he blew his knee out. 
  Now he just takes his aspirations out on his players. 
  Mm. 
  see, that's the problem with you athletes. 
  I mean, my brother does the same thing. 
  You put your all into some game, and then for what? 
  To end up with some busted knee? 
  No, thanks. 
  I guess for me, there's just more to life than just football. 
  On that thought, somebody I need to deal with. 
  I know. 
  I know. 
  You slut-shamed my sister. 
  OK? 
  You made a fool out of yourself. 
  I got dumped. 
  I was drunk. 
  And now you're out of tonight's game, out for Homecoming. 
  Exactly. 
  My life is destroyed, but, hey, at least I got what I deserved, right? 
  Destroyed? 
  Listen, Ash, grow up, man. 
  There's more to life than just football. 
  Not for me. 
  Not anymore. 
  It's over. 
  Without me, there's no way that you guys win tonight. 
  Ugh. 
  What are you, lost? 
  Actually, I know my way around. 
  This used to be my office, remember? 
  Yeah, well, it's my locker room now, so, aren't you early for this meeting with the refs? 
  Looks like I'm right on time. 
  Gentlemen, good to see you. 
  Good to see you. 
  I noticed you haven't put up any new championship banners since you started here. 
  It's too bad they don't hand them out for losing. 
  Most of those are mine. 
  All right. 
  Let's get this thing over with. 
  Uh, fellas, I know you're here to discuss the, uh, the new targeting rules before the game. 
  I think it's unnecessary. 
  Uh, personally, I think they're a major step forward in protecting defenseless players. 
  OK, well, my team is well aware of the rules, so, I think we're covered. 
  OK, then. 
  I guess we're done here. 
  Great. 
  thanks, boys. 
  OK. 
  All right. 
  Oh, by the way, I heard you benched your star wide receiver tonight. 
  Making it too easy, Coach. 
  Hey, yo, Shawn! 
  Ohh, Tamia, thank goodness. 
  Miss Ruth, what you doing here? 
  Shawn said he had something to deal with and asked me to baby-sit. 
  He was supposed to be back over an hour ago. 
  I need to get Maya some milk and get to work. 
  You tell my son I am not happy. 
  I don't like being summoned, Shawn Scott. 
  Ain't what this is, Ty. 
  This here's everything I saved. 
  You been stealing from me? 
  Nah, man. 
  My own cut. 
  On the straight up. 
  So, why you giving me this? 
  'Cause I want out. 
  I want to take my little girl out of here, go live in Louisiana with my cousin. 
  I want something better for her. 
  Hoping this here buys me that. 
  You think it's that easy? 
  Nah. 
  OK. 
  Looks like we got a deal. 
  But you overpaid, chief. 
  You ain't worth this much, Shawn Scott. 
  Never was. 
  Hell, no. 
  Ha! 
  But, uh, enjoy that crawfish in Louisiana. 
  Oh. 
  Hey. 
  Hey. 
  How you doing? 
  Good. 
  um, I was just here earlier. 
  I forgot my purse. 
  I thought, um I didn't think you'd be working with the game tonight. 
  I was just picking up my paycheck. 
  Why? 
  Are we avoiding each other again? 
  No. 
  Maybe. 
  OK, yes. 
  Just after last night, things feel a little odd. 
  How is that? 
  Well, for starters, I put my heart out there and you turned me down. 
  Come on. 
  That's not what I meant, all right? 
  I'll never turn you down. 
  You know that, right? 
  So, I should probably go. 
  Right. 
  Yeah. 
  Of course you should go. 
  The game tonight? 
  Good luck. 
  Yo. 
  Just pulled up. 
  Man. 
  You had me scared. 
  Ain't nothing to be scared about. 
  Turns out you were right about all of it. 
  There is a way out, even for me. 
  Just took me throwing some paper Tyrone's way and now we all square. 
  Told you I'd take care of it. 
  Ha ha ha! 
  But I owe you, Coop. 
  Took you believing in me for me to believe in myself. 
  Hey, man, listen. 
  You don't owe me nothing. 
  Hey, you know what I'm gonna do now? 
  No. 
  You tell me. 
  I'm gonna make a new life for Maya. 
  Start over. 
  Maybe you can come with us. 
  Start over, too. 
  You know what I'm saying? 
  Hey, Shawn. 
  This here is for Bonez. 
  I stayed there with him until miss Ruth came, and then I I don't know. 
  It just don't seem real. 
  One second we was talking like normal, and then I'll never get that sound out of my head or the look on his mom's face when she saw him. 
  An hour ago, he was going on and on about how he wanted to get out and how he just I'm sorry, baby girl. 
  I'm sorry, Coop. 
  I know. 
  But you ain't surprised, are you? 
  That don't make it any easier. 
  Look, I know me and Shawn ain't get along for a lot of reasons, but The three of us, we came up together. 
  All right? 
  He was one of our own. 
  And I'ma help you through this. 
  Please welcome your Beverly High Eagles. 
  Good evening, everybody, and welcome to the 2018 Homecoming Game. 
  The cross-town rivalry between Malibu and Beverly comes to a head tonight. 
  Hey. 
  How are you feeling? 
  Coach.

  You know? 
  So, let's have a good time.

  Whoo! 
  Five! 
  All right, all right!

  That's what I'm talking about. 
  On Malibu's 30-yard line. 
  That's what I'm talkin' about. 
  Get 'em, D! 
  It's all right. 
  And the chess match continues. 
  The Dolphins have managed to match every move the Eagles have tried so far. 
  Whoo! 
  Yes! 
  Yes! 
  Touchdown! 
  And the Dolphins take the early lead. 
  Aah! 
  Come on!

  And there's another one. 
  The Dolphins jumping out to a two-touchdown lead. 
  What is happening? 
  Is it No, it's not Spencer. 
  He's solid. 
  It's just Malibu's defense. 
  It's they for real. 
  No, no, Th they're shifting whenever You all right? 
  Dad, I can't move the ball. 
  OK? 
  Th their defense is in my face every single play. 
  What do you want me to do? 
  And that's the half. 
  Malibu leading Beverly 14-0. 
  The Eagles will have to find some way to move the ball in the second half if they have any chance of a comeback. 
  It ain't over yet. 
  Heads up. 
  Head up, y'all, head up. 
  Something ain't right, Coach. 
  Look, I know this might sound crazy They have our plays. 
  They got our plays. 
  Come on. 
  What are we gonna do? 
  We just need to make some adjustments. 
  Adjustments? 
  Dad, we had one first down the entire first half, OK? 
  One. 
  Th that might be a record. 
  I need you to calm down, all right? 
  We'll figure out a way to move the ball. 
  How? 
  how are we gonna move the ball? 
  They know we're gonna run. 
  They know when we're gonna pass, OK? 
  They've been on us all game. 
  Spencer. 
  How well do you remember Crenshaw's offensive playbook? 
  It's burned into my skull, but ain't no way this team can adjust on the fly. 
  All right. 
  Maybe so, but I've seen you play. 
  It's basically a two-man game, right? 
  You playing catch the QB? 
  Yeah, you right. 
  Pick your favorite 3 plays. 
  Get to work. 
  Jordan's gonna need a quick lesson. 
  Get it done. 
  Get it done. 
  Listen up, J. 
  Hey, I got an idea. 
  Come on. 
  Hey, yo, Coach, can I see that? 
  Thank you. 
  What you gonna do is you gonna look this guy off, right? 
  Then you got Spencer over the middle, all right? 
  Hit him on the post. 
  Post corner. 
  Like that. 
  - Yeah. 
  - All right. 
  All right, Spence.

  For Shawn, man. 
  And here we go. 
  Two quarters left to determine who owns the division. 
  The Eagles have put themselves in quite the hole, trailing by 14. 
  Let's see if their halftime adjustments will allow them to move that ball against this stifling Dolphins team.

  - Yes, sir. 
  - I love you. 
  - I love you. 
  All right. 
  Good job. 
  Good game. 
  Nice catch. 
  If I don't watch out, you're gonna take my spot in the playoffs. 
  See you later. 
  Where'd that trick play come from? 
  Crenshaw's playbook. 
  We should add it to ours. 
  Good idea, man. 
  You know, we're gonna have to come up with a whole new playbook, since someone gave Malibu ours. 
  Yeah, I can't believe that happened. 
  Come on, man. 
  It was you. 
  OK? 
  I I saw the look you threw Delgado, OK? 
  How you told me there's no way that we could win? 
  They read every single move we made, man. 
  Will you just let me explain this? 
  - Explain what? 
  - I made a mistake, Jordan, OK? 
  My life was falling apart, and in a moment of weakness Another moment of weakness. 
  H how many times are you gonna use that sorry-ass excuse to cover yourself, huh? 
  And your spot in the playoffs? 
  It's gone. 
  As soon as I tell my dad what you did, you're off this team. 
  You serious right now? 
  Over one game that you just won? 
  I thought you said it was just football, man. 
  You know what? 
  No. 
  Not to me. 
  And if you would've been there on that field with us, you would've felt that. 
  Hey. 
  Um, the bakers were just leaving, and they let me in. 
  But if if you want to be alone, I can No, it's all good. 
  Come in. 
  Who were you listening to? 
  Nothing. 
  I, uh I got to put those on sometimes to block out the noise. 
  I heard what happened. 
  I'm so sorry. 
  Were you close with him? 
  Yeah, we used to be. 
  We took our own paths, and it was a complicated friendship. 
  He was taking steps to better himself. 
  You know, he had a daughter. 
  I don't even know how they told her. 
  It doesn't matter how you find out. 
  It's all a A blur that doesn't seem real. 
  I don't remember how my dad told me about my mom. 
  I just remember Time standing still. 
  Kind of like right now? 
  So, that just happened. 
  - Look, Leila - It's OK. 
  What's OK? 
  I understand what that was. 
  What was it? 
  You blocking out the noise. 
  Look, I know you've been through a lot these past few hours, and I don't want this to affect our friendship. 
  I do. 
  So, you don't want to be friends? 
  No, I want to be more than friends. 
  - But you said  
  - Look, I know what I said. 
  All right? 
  That ain't how I feel. 
  I don't want to keep pushing away how I feel no more. 
  Life's too short for that. 
  It's up to you. 
  You want to be friends? 
  No. 
  I know it's hard, but, uh I'm just glad that you're out of all this now. 
  It ain't over. 
  We got you. 
  Probably best you go stay with your mother for a while. 
  No use you being here if you're off the team. 
  You know that she doesn't want me. 
  That's for you to figure out. 
  Coach Locker room. 
  Now. 
  What's up, fellas? 
  What's going on? 
  About to find out. 
  All right. 
  Fellas, I'm, uh, gonna keep this short and sweet. 
  Uh, apparently, the sports committee received an anonymous tip that one of our players, uh, violated the drug policy, so, I'm afraid y'all are gonna have to get drug-tested today. 
  - What? 
  - Come on. 
  I know. 
  I know it's a pain. 
  I'm sure y'all don't have anything to worry about. 
  Let's just line up, get this thing over with, all right? 
  Come on. 
  Go. 
  Let's go, let's go, let's go. 
  So What happens if a player tests positive? 
  Oh, they get suspended for the playoffs. 
  Yeah. 
  Ahem. 
  Dad I'm gonna fail. 
  Hell of a performance last night. 
  You don't remember me, do you? 
  I used to coach with your dad. 
  I even recommended that he take over at Beverly when I left. 
  They were high on him. 
  Then Billy Baker swooped in with his NFL resume, and suddenly now the job wasn't Corey's anymore. 
  Game's over, Coach. 
  We won. 
  All right? 
  You can stop messing with my head. 
  I wouldn't do that. 
  I always liked Corey. 
  I still do. 
  I mean, sure, he let his emotions get in the way of things sometimes, but he's a good man. 
  Yeah. 
  Good man who abandoned his family. 
  I never understood that. 
  I just know that He carried a picture of you around in his wallet, bragging about his son. 
  The Corey I remember He wouldn't leave without a reason. 
  And Billy Baker, that man, he'll do anything to get what he wants. 
  Hey. 
  We may have an issue here.
