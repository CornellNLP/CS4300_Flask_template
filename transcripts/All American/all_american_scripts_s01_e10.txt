 Previously on "All American" Is this your house? 
  - No, this Willie's crib. 
  - You know them? 
  These here are my grandkids. 
  I can accept you, my grandkids. 
  She's my wife. 
  She's the mother of my children. 
  If you can't learn to accept her, then there's nothing left to talk about. 
  I guess we're done here. 
  I guess we are. 
  We haven't really defined this, um What, relationship? 
  So, it is a relationship. 
  Did Tyrone give you that bag? 
  Mind your business. 
  Did Tyrone tell you? 
  Whatever you're about to ask, don't. 
  Your boy already gone. 
  Ain't nothing gonna change that. 
  Anything else you try to do at this point gonna get you killed. 
  - I want in. 
  - In what? 
  - Shawn's spot. 
  - It's gone. 
  - I'll be all right. 
  - No, not if you keep talking all that revenge stuff. 
  What am I supposed to do? 
  I don't know. 
  Walk away? 
  Spencer James. 
  I ain't here for no reunion. 
  You forgetting where you at? 
  COOP: Come on, man. 
  Why you gotta do this? 
  Because Shawn had my back and now I got his. 
  Shawn's gone, all right? 
  He don't need nobody having his back, not no more. 
  Why can't you stay out of this? 
  I'ma stay right here until you look me in my eye and promise me you ain't gonna do nothing stupid. 
  You know I can't just let you in. 
  So do what you gotta do. 
  You sure about that? 
  Let's get it over with. 
  [BOTH GRUNTING] 
  MAN: Girl, you know it's true I can be your man, yeah, know this love is true I can be smooth, shorty, know I got the juice Let me get a chance, baby, got nothing to lose, yeah Girl, I know it's true I could be your man, yeah, know this love is true  
  - SPENCER: Ooh! 
  - LEILA: Dillon's got some game. 
  Hey, don't encourage him. 
  You scared I'm gonna school you in front of your girl? 
  - SPENCER: See? 
  - LEILA: Just like his brother. 
  I do like him calling me your girl, though. 
  You are my girl. 
  It's just nice hearing it out loud. 
  Don't get me wrong. 
  It's been nice living in our little secret romance bubble, but eventually, we're gonna have to Let the rest of the world know? 
  You're right. 
  It's time. 
  Time for you to check the ball. 
  Keep running your mouth, I'm gonna start playing real defense. 
  What's our plan? 
  We don't have to make a big deal of it. 
  I just I want Olivia to hear it from me first. 
  Asher already knows, and while he's been M. I. A. ever since, it's just a matter of time. 
  DILLON: We gonna finish this game or not? 
  We should probably go home. 
  Dude, we always have to leave early. 
  Will you get Dillon to the car? 
  I'll be right behind you. 
  COOP: Look, it's not what you think. 
  SPENCER: Judging by them bruises, I think you got jumped into Tyrone's crew. 
  OK, well, technically, it is what you think. 
  Come on, Coop. 
  Now I got my reasons, Spence. 
  Shawn wouldn't have wanted this for you. 
  I'm doing this for Shawn. 
  It was Tyrone. 
  He had Shawn killed. 
  Then why you join his crew? 
  Because he gotta go. 
  Coop, this gonna get you killed, man. 
  It ain't about me. 
  It's about keeping every kid in our neighborhood safe. 
  I'm doing this for them. 
  Doing what, exactly? 
  Look, man, these dudes? 
  They about loyalty, so if they find out Tyrone had Shawn killed, they gonna handle him for me. 
  But they gotta trust me first. 
  That's why I'm rolling with them. 
  Have you lost your damn mind? 
  Maybe, but not all of us get to leave Crenshaw. 
  Some of us don't want to. 
  But this is how I make our community safe and get Tyrone off the street. 
  Patience know about this? 
  [SIGHS] 
  I didn't think so. 
  Come on, Coop, this ain't you. 
  Look, there's gotta be a better way to get Tyrone out of here. 
  I'm doing this my way. 
  If you come up with a better idea, you let me know. 
  Until then, you gotta stay away. 
  It's like that? 
  It's like that. 
  Hey, babe. 
  Hey, mama. 
  Mmm. 
  You prepping for Logan high? 
  I'm telling you, they look deceptively easy. 
  Yeah, well, we'll light 'em up, dad. 
  They got Mitchell on the end, though. 
  I thought he was injured. 
  He  
  OLIVIA: What? 
  I'm a coach's daughter. 
  I pay attention. 
  OK. 
  Look at you. 
  Well, Mitchell will be back by playoffs, so we need a game plan. 
  Spencer, Jordan, we should meet up after school, discuss some options. 
  I need to throw in a wrinkle I can't today. 
  Sorry. 
  What? 
  Wh where you gotta be? 
  Promised Ripley we'd see a movie. 
  - BILLY: Oh. 
  - JORDAN: Um, but I'll see you guys later? 
  Yeah? 
  All right. 
  Bye. 
  Ripley. 
  Is it just me or is he acting weirder than usual? 
  Weird. 
  Spencer, you coming? 
  Yeah. 
  You know what? 
  Uh, you guys go ahead and, uh, I'll take Spencer. 
  OK. 
  Uh, let's go. 
  See y'all later. 
  Come on, Olivia. 
  Am I in trouble? 
  Not at all. 
  But I want to hear about What's bothering you. 
  I'm fine, really. 
  No. 
  You're not fine. 
  And I hope you know you can talk to me. 
  [SIGHS] 
  All this. 
  Me moving to Beverly. 
  This is about giving me a shot to make something of myself, right? 
  So I can get into the NFL, so I can give back to my 'hood. 
  I'm just realizing I can't wait that long. 
  Is this about Coop? 
  It's about all of it. 
  Shawn's murder. 
  Coop. 
  All this gang stuff. 
  My little brother and his friends can't even play in the park without running into gangs. 
  How long before my phone rings and I gotta say good-bye to somebody I love? 
  I'ma do something about it. 
  I'ma get my community to do something about it. 
  And you know what? 
  You should. 
  We have so much faith in you. 
  If there is anyone that can rally a community behind them, it's you. 
  Thanks. 
  Because I got an idea. 
  MAN: Trailblaze with a blazer and a fitted I'm like Russell with my hustle But I wasn't born a Simmons Wasn't born a coward, I throw power, Roger Clemens PATIENCE: I don't know. 
  It'll be, like, really annoying. 
  CHRIS: No, dang, I should be acting like we be listening or something. 
  [LAUGHTER] 
  Oh, snap. 
  What up, big dawg? 
  How's it going? 
  [INDISTINCT CHATTER] 
  Uh, if you're looking for Coop, save yourself the trouble. 
  She didn't show up again today. 
  CHRIS: Psh. 
  Yeah, man, Miss Chambers gonna fail her ass in chemistry, that's for sure. 
  Damn. 
  How much days she miss? 
  31 this week. 
  At least when she was rolling with Shawn, she was still focusing on graduating. 
  Now she's rolling with Tyrone and them, so who the hell knows? 
  I'm worried about her, man. 
  Yeah, I know. 
  Me, too. 
  Hey, hang in there with Coop, all right? 
  - No doubt. 
  - OK. 
  - Look. 
  - All right, buddy. 
  - [GIGGLES] 
  - OK, hold up. 
  I thought Spencer and Kia ain't really been on speaking terms since they broke up. 
  They ain't. 
  Hey. 
  Wow! 
  Spencer James! 
  What, they kick you out of Beverly already? 
  It's nice to see you, too. 
  I didn't say all that. 
  Wow. 
  OK. 
  Not gonna make this easy, huh? 
  Mmm. 
  And he's still smart. 
  Damn. 
  It's like that? 
  Yeah. 
  it is. 
  Hey, Kia, come on, seriously. 
  I need your help and your uncle Flip's. 
  Look, I'm planning a rally, all right? 
  I want to take back the parks from the gangs. 
  You want to plan a rally? 
  Yeah. 
  I gotta get to work. 
  But I'll meet you after. 
  WILLIE: See? 
  There you go. 
  Whenever you're on the move, you're always firing off your back foot. 
  See? 
  See? 
  There you go. 
  You did it again. 
  All arm. 
  OK, yeah, but I threw a touchdown. 
  Against a weak team. 
  When you did that against Hawthorne, they picked you off. 
  You watched that game tape? 
  Yeah. 
  Chatsworth, too. 
  Waste of my time. 
  You keep making the same mistake. 
  Were you this hard on my dad? 
  Depends who you ask. 
  When I realized your dad had a chance to be great, I pushed him to be great. 
  That sounds like a fun childhood. 
  Gotta sacrifice to make the NFL. 
  I don't hear him complaining. 
  OK, yeah, you should come over more often, then. 
  What does he think of you coming over here after school? 
  He doesn't know. 
  Listen, um Can I ask you a question? 
  Only if you want the answer. 
  Do you think I have a chance to be great? 
  I don't know yet. 
  KIA: Interesting place to meet. 
  You trying to get shot? 
  Ha! 
  SPENCER: Hey, I remember I used to kick your butt in freeze tag over here. 
  Correction. 
  I used to kick your butt in freeze tag. 
  Couldn't nobody catch me. 
  Ha ha! 
  Man. 
  This park unrecognizable now. 
  I mean, kids ain't played here in years. 
  Don't nobody feel safe using it no more except the gangs. 
  MAN: So, what you gonna do about it, homeboy? 
  Hey, Mr. 
  Williams, what up? 
  What's up, Spence? 
  - SPENCER: Good. 
  - FLIP: Hey, Kia. 
  All right. 
  So you got me out here. 
  Speak on it. 
  What's your big plan? 
  It better not be just to talk everybody to death. 
  KIA: Besides, folks ain't gonna risk their safety by showing up to publicly speak out against gangs. 
  No, actually, I want to hold the rally so I can get enough signatures to get a city law passed. 
  KIA: What kind of law? 
  An ordinance, banning all gang members from congregating in public places. 
  Look, why is this so funny? 
  You remember I'm a Blood, right? 
  Hey, it worked in Detroit. 
  San Bernardino got it. 
  So what you saying is you want to give the cops more ammunition to harass us. 
  Come on, man. 
  Look, little homie, I respect what you trying to do. 
  These young thugs out here calling themselves Bloods and Crips. 
  Ain't got no code. 
  I bet, so why won't you help me? 
  'Cause of what you're proposing. 
  This wack-ass law making it where me and my O. 
  G. 
  Bloods can't come and go as we please without 5-O stopping us anytime we so much as look at a park? 
  Look, I feel you, but ain't that inconvenience worth it if it means stopping the gang violence from taking over right now? 
  I don't know. 
  Won't we ask Stephon Clark or Philando Castile? 
  Oh, that's right. 
  They dead. 
  Look, no disrespect, but we got names in our community, too, all right? 
  Victims of gang violence. 
  Pastor read 'em out every week. 
  - So what? 
  - So what? 
  I can't let my little brother, his friends be next on that list. 
  So it's cool if you ain't gonna help me, all right? 
  I'ma do this by myself. 
  Go ahead, man. 
  See, right there, dude. 
  You're talking about my freedom, my way of life. 
  Ain't letting nobody try to take that from me. 
  Hey. 
  Hey. 
  How was the movie? 
  Uh, it was It was boring. 
  Ah. 
  Boring. 
  That's too bad. 
  Tell me again, who'd you Who'd you see the movie with? 
  - Ripley. 
  - Don't say Ripley because she came here looking for you. 
  Dad, listen. 
  Yeah, you should've given her a heads-up that you were lying to me. 
  OK, I I didn't go see a movie. 
  Keep going. 
  I was with grandpa Willie. 
  I've been going to see him now a couple times after school. 
  Doing what? 
  More training. 
  He thinks I can be great. 
  He told you that? 
  No, not exactly. 
  Jordan, he's going to disappoint you. 
  I don't know why you just can't forgive him. 
  Wouldn't even know where to begin. 
  People make mistakes, Dad. 
  Whatever happened to second chances? 
  - JORDAN: Good night. 
  - BILLY: Good night, man. 
  So what are you gonna do? 
  Not quit. 
  Look, Flip ain't wrong. 
  Neither are you. 
  There's a lot of good in our community, but we have problems, too. 
  You're picking the one that's most important to you and doing something about it. 
  Don't let no old man run you off. 
  Your mom sure knows how to give a pep talk. 
  Yeah, she all right. 
  Smartass. 
  Oh, Spencer. 
  Got a guest. 
  Hey, Kia, what's up? 
  DILLON: This is so not gonna be awkward. 
  Just 'cause my uncle ain't down to help or whatever doesn't mean I'm not. 
  Hey. 
  Hey. 
  Kia, this is Leila. 
  - LEILA: Hi. 
  - DILLON: His girlfriend. 
  GRACE: Dillon, get your butt in here and stop bothering your brother. 
  [SIGHS] 
  It was just getting good. 
  [EXHALES] 
  OK, so, I was thinking. 
  Maybe instead of planning a big rally, you could focus on something you know for sure our people would show up for. 
  - LEILA: Like what? 
  - SPENCER: We can get folks out to restore Essence Park. 
  For the kids. 
  Growing up, that park was like my safe place. 
  You know, I could go there and just be a kid and not have to worry about surviving. 
  It's where I threw my first football. 
  KIA: And now kids can't even walk through it. 
  SPENCER: hey, we can change that. 
  We get folks there to help clean it up, once we get them there Use it as an opportunity to convince them that getting rid of the gangs is good for the neighborhood, get them to sign the petition. 
  I like it, but these things don't plan themselves. 
  We gotta move fast, before my uncle or any of those other gang leaders have time to convince folks not to show. 
  We're gonna need some supplies. 
  I can help with that. 
  We're also gonna need some serious manpower. 
  Hey, I got that covered. 
  MAN: And one time, and one time One time for the hometown Two times for the hometown hero, yeah 3 times for the kids who just want to make it out And nobody ever wanted to believe them One time for the hometown Two times for the hometown hero, yeah 3 times for the kids who just want to make it out And nobody ever wanted to believe them [POP MUSIC PLAYING] 
  GABBY: Leila. 
  So, you and Spencer. 
  - LEILA: Surprised? 
  - GABBY: Yes, it is surprising. 
  And I'm not gonna lie, we're a little offended. 
  - LEILA: Who's "we"? 
  - GIRL: The rest of the school. 
  Oh, you took a poll. 
  This is serious, Leila. 
  Why does it matter? 
  The timeline matters. 
  Since you broke up with Asher, like, 5 minutes ago. 
  All of this drama isn't very becoming of a Stu Co President. 
  I'm just saying. 
  Elections are coming up. 
  It's not gonna end well. 
  Who cares? 
  Depends on how attached to popularity you are. 
  Gabby's the reason I don't have more friends. 
  So I met Spencer's ex today. 
  Kia? 
  - You know about Kia? 
  - Yeah, Spencer mentioned her. 
  She's, like, really cool. 
  Leila, I don't think you're in a competition with Spencer's ex. 
  I know. 
  Are you free the rest of today? 
  We could really use your help. 
  Yeah. 
  Who's "we"? 
  MAN: I'm still where we belong KIA: Who would've thought Spencer James would turn youth activist? 
  I mean, how many rallies I try to get you to go to while we were dating? 
  Enough that you broke up with me 'cause I never go. 
  No, I broke up with you because you didn't understand how important my activism was to me. 
  You was all about football. 
  I mean, it's crazy how it took you moving to Beverly Hills to become the guy I always wanted you to be. 
  Yeah, I guess. 
  Come on. 
  So? 
  Like, what changed? 
  Who do I have to thank for this new Spencer James? 
  No one. 
  Look, I guess splitting my time between here and Beverly Hills gave me some perspective, that's all. 
  So Leila seems nice. 
  Yeah. 
  Yeah, she's special. 
  I mean, I'm just glad you didn't move to Beverly Hills and bring home a Kardashian. 
  All right, OK, yeah, whatever. 
  [LAUGHTER] 
  MAN: You want the fellas with the real money? 
  - Real money - Look There ain't no money? 
  Well, I'll see you TYRONE: Boy, Spencer been busy lately. 
  COOP: Just planning a little picnic in the park. 
  It ain't that deep. 
  Yo. 
  Why am I a hundred short? 
  I don't know. 
  I just gave you what Malik gave me. 
  What you mean? 
  It was all there when I gave it to you. 
  COOP: Now, Malik, are you serious right now? 
  You're the one that collected the money. 
  What, you can't count? 
  Nah, nah, ain't nothing wrong with my math. 
  All I know is, one of y'all better come up with my paper fast, or we gonna have a problem. 
  No sweat. 
  How I know you ain't giving me back what's already mines? 
  I ain't stupid. 
  If I stole it from you, I'd have took that to the grave. 
  Yeah, you definitely ain't stupid. 
  So you were just gonna steal from me. 
  [LAUGHS] 
  Now, come on. 
  What is this, a joke? 
  You really gonna believe this he-she over me? 
  Uhh! 
  Don't ever disrespect me! 
  You gonna let him talk to you like that? 
  I mean, Ty, it's unnecessary. 
  You already handled it. 
  Yeah, and now I want to see you handle it. 
  [MALIK GROANING] 
  Uhh! 
  [MALIK HITS GROUND] 
  That's for trying to make me look bad with the money. 
  Tyrone, I'll be right back. 
  - COOP: Patience, wait. 
  - PATIENCE: No, hell no! 
  What the hell was that? 
  What the hell was that? 
  What the hell was that? 
  No, the Coop I know would never hurt anybody. 
  No, it's just some things I got to do now. 
  - Yeah? 
  yeah, yeah. 
  - It don't change who I am. 
  Does that lie work on you? 
  'Cause it doesn't work on me. 
  I don't even recognize who you are right now. 
  - What? 
  Patience. 
  - No, no, I'm done. 
  - Patience. 
  - I'm done. 
  We're done. 
  I'm good. 
  - Patience. 
  - I'm good. 
  Patience. 
  MAN: Get ready We about to have a good time We about to have a good time We about to have a good time We about to have a good time Hi. 
  Mrs. 
  Baker. 
  I didn't know you were gonna roll through. 
  You're family, Spencer. 
  Where else would we be? 
  Brought snacks, uh, extra trash bags, water, some cleaning wipes, gloves, and some other stuff, and Billy should be here soon with more supplies. 
  Can't thank y'all enough, seriously. 
  I'll get this set up and get to work. 
  Thank you. 
  Hey. 
  It's still early. 
  What if nobody else shows up? 
  Then we still clean up the park. 
  OK? 
  Nothing changes. 
  OK? 
  All right. 
  WILLIE: There you go. 
  Keep it going. 
  Again. 
  Stay off that back foot. 
  Ah. 
  Damn. 
  5 in a row. 
  Not bad. 
  Wait. 
  What happened to telling me I had to make it every time? 
  I decided to ease up on you, since being babied seems to be what you're used to. 
  You don't think I can get better? 
  It doesn't matter what I think. 
  It should only matter what you think, and clearly, you don't think very much of yourself, so stop wasting my time. 
  Coming here was a mistake. 
  Hold up. 
  Where you going? 
  Home. 
  Apparently I'm wasting his time. 
  Do you know how many times he's told me that? 
  He's just testing you. 
  MAN: Hey, hey Get up Yo Here we go again, eh I've been on the same damn thing since day one Work, work, work it out, I'm grinding till my day come Come in here, you ain't one, so you shouldn't say nothin' Knock it out the park like mark when I base run The cardinal rule is to get it how you living Till they can't stay true But we ain't playin' round, it's crazy COOP: Dang, boy. 
  Everybody and their mama came out, literally. 
  Yeah. 
  You did all this for me? 
  Look, you wanted me to come up with a better plan, so that's what I'm trying to do. 
  A'ight. 
  I know you're worried about me. 
  I ain't gonna stop fighting for your life, all right? 
  So you can save your breath. 
  Well, tell me this. 
  Hmm? 
  How in the hell you get your current chick and your ex-chick both to come out here and do manual labor for you, and I can't even hold on to one? 
  What, Patience? 
  Yep. 
  Damn. 
  Probably for the best. 
  She's safer that way. 
  KIA: OK. 
  Start with the trash on the southwest corner, then work your way in. 
  Delilah and Derrick, focus on the petitions. 
  Make sure Spencer has pens, extra clipboards. 
  You know the drill. 
  Sienna, I need you on the kids. 
  OK, make this fun for them. 
  Dance battles, you know, whatever. 
  Whatever will get them excited. 
  Stop staring at her. 
  She's incredible, and so passionate about her community. 
  I spent an hour with her, and it made me question what the hell we're doing in Beverly Hills. 
  Look, you've got your own problems back home. 
  Gabby is not your friend, and the rumors are getting worse. 
  OK, what's she saying now? 
  That you only became friends with me again to get close to Spencer. 
  Is that what you think? 
  No, of course not. 
  Look, the point is is that Gabby's gunning for you, OK? 
  Watch your back with her. 
  [INDISTINCT CHATTER] 
  No time like the present. 
  You have everyone here and invested. 
  Time to get those signatures. 
  [CHUCKLES] 
  I bet. 
  Maybe over there, we could just Damn. 
  Look, I don't want no problems, a'ight? 
  Ain't no problem. 
  But seeing that you got everybody out here to convince them to sign on to this ban, seems only right that they get to hear why it'll destroy us. 
  So you're hijacking my event? 
  Come on. 
  It's a public park, Spence. 
  I got every right to chill here and talk to my neighbors, at least while I still can. 
  Look, these gangbangers don't care if your daughter's in the way. 
  They're gonna spray anyway. 
  Vanessa, how many times your boy Jared been stopped by the cops already, on his way home from school, just because he fit the description? 
  Too damn many. 
  Exactly. 
  And if you sign that paper, then the cops won't even need that excuse. 
  WOMAN: Forever in our hearts, that's life and death all day We still gotta live here, though. 
  It ain't safe to piss these gangs off. 
  [SIGHS] 
  I don't know, guys. 
  I gotta look out for her. 
  If they can't chill here or sell their drugs here, it forces them to set up shop somewhere else. 
  And that's how we push them out the neighborhood. 
  FLIP: They ain't the only ones that's gonna get pushed out. 
  Man, us O. G. S, we've been looking out for this community since day one, when nobody cared what happened to y'all. 
 
 
 
  Who gonna protect y'all when we gone, too? 
  Look, come on, Mr. Wilson, you got a kid. 
  If we don't dead this now and stand up to these gangbangers, it's just gonna keep happening. 
  I feel you, Spence. 
  You're doing a good thing here, but I don't know that this is the answer. 
  MAN: Yeah, and that's not WILLIE: So, what? 
  You came here to just stare at me? 
  I came for Jordan's sake. 
  Now we have to go to Spencer's event, so - You ready, J? 
  - Yeah. 
  Jordan, go grab my hat from the room. 
  You're coming? 
  It's my community. 
  What are you doing with my son? 
  Are you worried I'll tell him? 
  Why can't you just stay out of my life? 
  You're at my house. 
  - Oh, here we go. 
  - You came to me. 
  I I - Whoa, whoa, whoa, grandpa. 
  - Dad, stop, stop. 
  - Are you for real right now? 
  Stop. 
  - You all right? 
  He's not faking, dad. 
  Look at him. 
  - Dad. 
  - I'm OK. 
  It's diabetes. 
  My sugar level must be getting low. 
  All right, well, let me get some orange juice, at least. 
  No, no, no, let me take care of this, OK? 
  Just go, dad. 
  I got this. 
  OK. 
  All right.

  [DISTANT CHATTER] 
  Not going so well, huh? 
  I barely got anybody to sign. 
  But some is better than none. 
  That's progress. 
  It's like running into a brick wall with these people. 
  Gangs got 'em all shook. 
  So how you been? 
  What? 
  I feel like we ain't talked in a while, and that's on me. 
  I know you've been busy with all this. 
  Look, I'm sorry I didn't tell you about me and Leila, a'ight? 
  It's OK. 
  Really. 
  Congratulations. 
  I just miss talking to my friend. 
  Yeah, me, too. 
  But, hey, I'm still there for you. 
  I know it's gotta be hard, you know, having a lot of people at Beverly. 
  I'm used to it. 
  I just don't want Leila to go through the same thing. 
  What you mean? 
  There are some rumors going around. 
  About me and Leila? 
  Mostly Leila. 
  Let's just say she's taking the bullet for the both of you. 
  [DISTANT SHOUTING] 
  FLIP: Yo, I'm trying to help y'all out.

  COOP: Tyrone, man.

  It don't even faze us no more. 
  We watching bodies drop like flies like it's normal. 
  This is not normal! 
  It ain't just another day in the neighborhood, all right? 
  Kids dying over nothing is not the answer. 
  Killing each other is not the answer, man. 
  Revenge is not the answer! 
  We all we got. 
  If we destroy each other, who else gonna fight for us? 
  - FLIP: Watch out, Spence. 
  - SPENCER: Hey! 
  Hey! 
  COOP: Chill, man. 
  FLIP: That's how it's going down? 
  You want it to go like this?

  CHRIS: Spence.

  Let's go! 
  GRACE: You scared me to death tonight, Spencer. 
  Look, mom, I'm sorry. 
  Stop talking. 
  I'm not done. 
  I've also never been more proud. 
  Do you understand what you did out there? 
  Yeah. 
  I didn't get the signatures I needed. 
  But you did one better. 
  You started a conversation that we all as a community desperately needed to have. 
  You're destined for great things, Spencer. 
  I always knew that. 
  Just don't ever scare me like that again. 
  Uhh Do me a favor, Jordan. 
  - Don't ever get diabetes. 
  - Heh heh! 
  I'll watch my step. 
  It's my fault. 
  I should be managing it better. 
  I ran out of them strips to check your blood sugar. 
  Why don't you just buy more? 
  - They're expensive. 
  - OK. 
  - Where can I get them? 
  - No. 
  I'm not your problem. 
  Your dad doesn't even want you to be here. 
  It's it's not his choice, OK? 
  Let let me help you. 
  It's complicated. 
  My doctor makes me get this specific type. 
  Well, I guess if you want to help just this once. 
  I do. 
  Probably best you give me some cash and I'll order them myself. 
  OK. 
  Here. 
  I, um, I hope this is enough. 
  Don't tell your dad about this. 
  So, what's this about a rumor? 
  Olivia told you. 
  How come you ain't telling me? 
  Because it's not important, not compared to what's happening here. 
  These are real problems, not some Beverly high popularity meter. 
  Leila, you're important. 
  Can I ask you a question, and you promise not to take it the wrong way? 
  OK. 
  Do we - Fit? 
  - Fit? 
  Our worlds are just so culturally different, Spencer. 
  I don't even know if I fit into my world anymore. 
  I'm just worried you'll think I don't fit into yours. 
  You don't have to. 
  Baby, our differences are what makes this so special. 
  We learn from each other. 
  You know, Kia asked what changed me. 
  And? 
  You've faced a lot of tragedy in your life, and you always manage to find a way to stay positive, give back to others. 
  You know, with your mom passing and And your dad always being gone. 
  None of that changed you at your core. 
  You always manage to find a light in the darkness, and that inspires me. 
  The difference between the person I was and who I am now Is you. 
  - Money - Yeah, I'll be out all night Tell my mama I'ma be all right Yeah, I do it for the money For the money [ECHOES] 
  Yeah, yeah, I do it for the money [ECHOES] 
  Your boy Spencer surprised me today. 
  He look he got a little gangster in him. 
  Got everybody talking. 
  Nah, you ain't gotta worry about Spence. 
  He ain't important. 
  Except he is. 
  Spence got everybody out to the park. 
  Got everybody feeling some type of way about us, about me. 
  - So? 
  - So I think I finally figured out your worth. 
  See, Spence got the notoriety. 
  And you, you his homie, so you important to him, right? 
  So you important to me. 
  I don't know how yet But you're gonna be real useful. 
  Hmm. 
  [KNOCK ON DOOR] 
  What's up? 
  What up? 
  You gonna let me in? 
  OK. 
  I underestimated you. 
  How? 
  I ain't get no signatures. 
  Don't matter. 
  You got to me. 
  Real talk, I should've checked Tyrone punk ass a long time ago. 
  Now he out here outta control, but I'ma fix that. 
  Come on, man. 
  Tyrone don't listen to nobody. 
  I'm telling you. 
  You got your park. 
  Keep doing what you doing, young Blood. 
  Maybe together, we can make some real change around here. 
  Yo, your homegirl that's running with Tyrone. 
  - Coop? 
  - She playing with fire. 
  Tyrone, he ain't like the rest of these cats. 
  When he go down smoking, he the type of buster that's gonna take everybody down with him. 
  Keep it in mind. 
  - [DISTANT SIREN] 
  - COOP: Messed up. 
  This whole Tyrone idea was just crazy. 
  It's too late now. 
  If I try to walk away from Ty, pssh. 
  We see how that ended for Shawn. 
  But nah, I I gotta finish what I started. 
  But I'ma be smart about it this time. 
  I can promise you that. 
  You gotta stop spinning your wheels trying to save me, Spence. 
  I need you to live your life in Beverly Hills. 
  Like, really take your shot, man. 
  I got to know your future is secure, man. 
  It's so important to me. 
  And it's important to me that you know you ain't alone, all right? 
  I ain't the only one who feels that way. 
  [DOOR OPENS] 
  Hey, man, um, I'm sorry for today. 
  Doesn't matter. 
  Grandpa Willie was just using me for money. 
  You were, uh You were right. 
  First time he hit me up was the day I got drafted into the NFL. 
  I barely had a moment to process anything before he called and asked me for $48,000. 
  Didn't even have a chance to enjoy my moment. 
  Why don't you push me harder? 
  Where is this coming from? 
  Seriously? 
  You're living in a house with a prodigy. 
  I know Spencer's great at football, OK, but What am I? 
  You're my son. 
  And as far as me not pushing you harder as your coach That's what my dad did to me, and look how we turned out. 
  It's more important to me to have a relationship with my son. 
  WOMAN: I I got two more lives, I got two [SCOFFS] 
  We should go somewhere else. 
  No. 
  Leila. 
  Olivia. 
  I know why you're trying so hard to tear me down. 
  You want the crown so damn bad, take it. 
  Go be Stu Co President or whatever. 
  It doesn't matter. 
  What is important are the real friends in my life People like Olivia, who stand by me no matter what The kind of friendship you clearly know nothing about. 
  And the next time you decide to come for me, you better swing harder 'cause I'm not gonna be so nice. 
  - SPENCER: Candles? 
  - COOP: Check. 
  But wait. 
  Don't light them yet. 
  I mean, just in case she don't Mood music? 
  Check. 
  Uh I got some Janelle Monae. 
  OK, and food? 
  Double check. 
  I got Patience's favorite. 
  I got fried fish from Mill's and I got peach cobbler from Dooley's. 
  But do you think she got your message? 
  Look, she said she'd be here, all right? 
  Come on, breathe, Coop, damn. 
  Come on. 
  Sit down. 
  [SIGHS] 
  You know she only coming on one condition, though, right? 
  Look, you gotta tell her the truth about why you're rolling with Tyrone. 
  Come on. 
  Patience can't be there for you if she don't know what's really going on. 
  Why didn't you tell me the truth sooner? 
  I just figured the less you knew about my plan for Ty, the better. 
  Mmm. 
  Just trying to protect the people I love, that's all. 
  Did you just say you love me? 
  Did you? 
  Man, it's just an expression. 
  Yeah, an expression that means you love me. 
  Ha! 
  Yeah. 
  WOMAN: What would you do Look, it's gonna take some time, but I promise you I'ma get out once Tyrone is gone. 
  And I promise you that I'll be here to make sure that Coop stays Coop. 
  To make sure no matter how crazy it gets, that you find your way back to the light. 
  WOMAN: What would you say? 
  Everybody knows the truth I would never leave your side Even for a moment Even when the stars start to fade Even when I'm reckless Until I'm down in my grave I'd walk a million miles Even in pouring rain No matter all my troubles, no I'll never give you pain [CHILD LAUGHS] 
  SPENCER: All right, here we go, here we go, here we go. 
  Down. 
  Set. 
  Hut! 
  MAN: My soul is sure But while we're young we can do what we want to [LAUGHS] 
  MAN: I ain't playin' around 'Cause it's freedom we found Freedom we found SPENCER: Hey, I'ma make ballers out of you yet. 
  Man, I taught you all your moves. 
  Incoming! 
  Hey, watch them laces. 
  MAN: I ain't playin' around 'Cause it's freedom we found Freedom we found All right, superman. 
  I see you. 
  MAN: They ain't takin' us down All right. 
  Y'all ready? 
  Who's going deep? 
  Go.

  MEN: hey, hey, hey, hey, hey

  - MAN 2: Freedom is not
