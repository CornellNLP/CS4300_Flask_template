 Previously on "All American"  
 Y'all called up Cameron Wilson to replace me, huh? 
  Hey, at least the brother's willing to rock a South Crenshaw Jersey. 
  Oh, so, now you're gonna guard me, huh? 
  Why not? 
  I already took your spot. 
  You ain't never gonna be me. 
  You think I have a chance to be great? 
  I don't know yet. 
  WILLIE: There you go. 
  Keep it going. 
  Again. 
  We're gonna have to come up with a whole new playbook since someone gave Malibu ours. 
  As soon as I tell my dad what you did, you're off this team. 
  You serious right now? 
  Probably best you go stay with your mother for a while. 
  No use you being here if you're off the team. 
  MAN: First things first, y'all know who I be Captain of the team, so all salute me Many others tried, but that ain't real Put the rack on me, I'mma score at will That's for everything, way too easy No lies, man, please believe me Big game now I'm on one, yeah MAN: On your marks. 
  And I'm breaking all the rules to the last Get set. 
  [WHISTLE BLOWS] 
  WOMEN: I got my whole team all in For me and you, that's what I need to do BILLY: You ready for the combine? 
  - MAN: My man. 
  - BILLY: Good to see you. 
  - MAN: Good to see you, too. 
  - BILLY: You been well? 
  MAN: Yeah, yeah. 
  Jordan, Spencer. 
  Come here, boys. 
  Come here right quick. 
  I'd like to introduce you to a good friend of mine Damon King. 
  We go way back, back to when I used to beat his ass in the NFL. 
  DAMON: Oh! 
  Oh, your memory always been that bad? 
  [LAUGHS] 
  It's Coach King now, fellas. 
  Wideouts, Angeles Southern University. 
  Jordan Baker. 
  Nice to meet you, Sir. 
  Jordan. 
  That's right. 
  Man, the last time I saw you, I'm pretty sure you was in diapers. 
  Your dad said you got a rocket for an arm, huh? 
  Excited to show it off, Sir. 
  I've always wanted to play for the Wolves. 
  Hmm. 
  BILLY: And this right here, Spencer James. 
  Yes, Sir. 
  Oh, yeah. 
  We know who you are. 
  Beverly's finest. 
  Man. 
  Crenshaw's own, actually. 
  Well, you lucky you moved to Beverly. 
  Otherwise, you might have missed the first two combines, young man. 
  Don't sleep on Crenshaw. 
  We may not have these fancy facilities, but a lot of dudes there can play. 
  OK. 
  I will keep that in mind. 
  So, you ever considered Angeles Southern for college ball? 
  Y'all got one of the best football programs in L. A. 
  And it's close to home. 
  And I send at least two guys to the league every single year. 
  BILLY: OK, easy, easy. 
  The combine hasn't even started yet. 
  You're already in the picture. 
  You know the game. 
  All right. 
  Spencer's gonna wait for the recruitment process to play out before he makes any commitments. 
  Listen, don't wait too long. 
  I only got a couple of guys graduating at receiver. 
  So, you talking, like, what, a couple scholarships? 
  Nah. 
  Talking one. 
  SPENCER: Oh, wow. 
  Heh. 
  Right. 
  Well, I appreciate the love, but, like Coach said, I'm keeping my options open. 
  Nice to meet you. 
  MAN: Feeling like I want a good time I just want to be yours 'cause I'm running out of time and now it's runnin' me over, uhh DILLON: I'm thinking I should be your agent. 
  You know, since you're about to blow up. 
  What you talking about? 
  I don't know. 
  Just these? 
  Somebody's gotta help you field all these college recruiters and help you make the right choice. 
  And we both know that I'm the brains in the family, so [BOTH CHUCKLE] 
  Wait. 
  Since when did mom want to play college football? 
  [KNOCK ON DOOR] 
  Oh. 
  Grandpa. 
  Are your parents home? 
  My dad's already at the field setting up the Combine and mom's got a conference. 
  Good. 
  Good. 
  Uh what what are you doing here? 
  You stopped coming by to see me. 
  Figured I'd come see why. 
  Well, you know, I've just been busy training for the playoffs and the Combine. 
  [CHUCKLES] 
  You call what your daddy does training? 
  [CHUCKLES] 
  Thought you wanted my help. 
  I thought about it, and I'm good, at least on the training. 
  But I'm still down to hang out, as long as you don't try to use me as an ATM again. 
  Hmm. 
  Heh! 
  You know what? 
  How about breakfast on me? 
  Hmm? 
  I can't today. 
  I gotta get to the Combine. 
  What for? 
  You ain't ready no how. 
  Um, I mean, I was good enough for the college recruiters to invite me. 
  You should never be satisfied with being good enough. 
  And just for the record, you got invited 'cause you're Billy Baker's boy. 
  Well, not everything is about my dad. 
  WILLIE: Let me ask you something. 
  When was the last time you were really challenged on the field? 
  You, personally? 
  You're about to go up against competition that's a whole lot more talented and prepared than you are. 
  You'll see. 
  Or maybe you'll see whenever I prove you wrong. 
  [INDISTINCT CHATTER] 
  OLIVIA: When you said we were co-hosting the combine, I didn't think you literally meant "we. " Ha ha! 
  Look, I appreciate you giving us a hand. 
  It's a big day. 
  Spencer, your brother. 
  Asher. 
  But I thought he was off the team. 
  Oh, he is. 
  He is. 
  Scouts control the invitations, not me. 
  He didn't RSVP. 
  Did you follow up? 
  I mean, this is a big deal for him. 
  He needs this. 
  If he wanted to be here, he would've RSVP'd like everybody else. 
  All right? 
  [TAP TAP] 
  Hey. 
  Ahem. 
  Hey. 
  Olivia. 
  What are you, uh What are you doing here? 
  I think the question is what are you doing here? 
  Have you been sleeping in your car? 
  Yeah. 
  I got into it with my dad, and he put me out. 
  Things didn't go over well with my mom in Malibu, either, so I'm sorry, Asher. 
  OK, but your plan can't be to drink your problems away and sleep in your car. 
  Don't tell anyone about the car thing. 
  My life is already pathetic enough as is. 
  OK. 
  On two conditions. 
  One put this on. 
  It's your Combine Jersey. 
  The Combine? 
  That's today? 
  Yes, Asher, it's today. 
  You're already off the football team. 
  I mean, this might be your last chance at a scholarship. 
  Do you even care about your future? 
  Of course. 
  Look, I just assumed with me being off the team, I'd be uninvited. 
  Well, you're not. 
  What's the second condition? 
  You take a shower, like now. 
  It's, like, really bad, dude. 
  SPENCER: When were you gonna tell me about night school? 
  I was here all summer and didn't even know you signed up. 
  Oh, baby, it's no big deal. 
  I was trying to finish my B. A. 
  , but Yeah, and you dropped out. 
  Was it because I moved to Beverly? 
  College isn't that far away for you. 
  It was past time I started saving for your college fund Yours and Dillon's. 
  That's what my extra money should've been going to. 
  I'm already so close to getting a scholarship, so close to doing what I said I would when I moved to Beverly. 
  You seen the letters? 
  You don't have to worry about saving for my tuition no more, all right? 
  You can go to school. 
  I don't want you betting everything on football. 
  You're too gifted for that. 
  What if you get injured and football goes away? 
  So does your scholarships. 
  Look, mom Your job is making something special out of everything that I could give you, like you always do. 
  OK? 
  [KISS] 
  - BOY: All right? 
  There you go. 
  - DIFFERENT BOY: Thank you. 
  What's up, baby? 
  What you doing here? 
  Stuck covering for Olivia, which she owes me for big-time. 
  Hey, everything OK? 
  Yeah, just a lot on my mind. 
  You know. 
  Big day. 
  Um, hey, can you cover for me a sec? 
  What's going on? 
  I thought you weren't worried about the combine. 
  I wasn't. 
  Now I gotta land a scholarship this weekend and commit. 
  What happened to keeping your options open? 
  My mom happened. 
  I can't have her throw away her dreams because of me. 
  JJ: Time to get it in, boys. 
  SPENCER: Hey. 
  What up, what up, what up? 
  JORDAN: What's going on, Spence? 
  Hey, let's show these college recruiters what Beverly boys are made of. 
  JORDAN: That's right, baby. 
  I like your spirit. 
  Can't wait to see you ball. 
  Yes, Sir. 
  Oh. 
  Spencer. 
  I took your advice. 
  About what? 
  About Crenshaw. 
  I like a player that's not afraid of a little competition. 
  MAN: Uhh, I just walked in Looking like a million dollars Got these haters bitter than a million olives Lord, please have mercy on all that witness Singing 3 Hail Marys, I'm about to kill it CHRIS: Hey, Spence, what up? 
  You were looking out, putting us on Coach King's radar, man. 
  All good, man. 
  Glad you came through. 
  Pleasure. 
  Can't say the same for your boy, though. 
  CHRIS: Hey, man, you the one that got him right in the first place. 
  Now, remember, man. 
  Iron, sharp as iron. 
  BILLY: All right, all right, all right. 
  Gentlemen, welcome to the District Combine. 
  For those of y'all who do not know me, or have not had the pleasure of getting their tails beat down by me or my team, I'm Coach Billy Baker, co-hosting alongside the college sponsors that are here in the building. 
  Let's give it up. 
  All right, now let's get down to brass tacks. 
  Players, congratulations. 
  You are here for one reason and one reason only. 
  You are the best that the area has to offer. 
  However, the Combine is designed to find the best of the best. 
  You will be tried and measured. 
  Follow me. 
  Height, weight, strength, and speed. 
  All of it will be tested, after which a select few of you will be invited to play the 7-on-7 showcase game tomorrow. 
  Gentlemen, making the cut is simple. 
  Be at your very best. 
  All right, fellas, get this. 
  ATHLETE: Whoo! 
  Hey, yo, man, you seen Olivia? 
  She said she'd be out front this morning. 
  No, man, I haven't seen her since last night. 
  So, you nervous? 
  No way. 
  I'm coming off a winning season. 
  All right. 
  Excuse me. 
  Though, last time I checked, the Combine wasn't a team event, so Heh. 
  That doesn't change a thing. 
  All right? 
  I know what I bring to the table. 
  Easy. 
  No one said you didn't. 
  I mean, you got prototypical size. 
  Pops played in the League. 
  Scouts are probably already salivating over you. 
  BILLY: All right, y'all, wideouts are next. 
  Line it up. 
  First up. 
  Asher Adams. 
  No? 
  Next up, Jay Quellin. 
  ASHER: Wait. 
  I'm here. 
  MAN: Yeah Yeah I got it, I got it, I got it Coach. 
  OK. 
  Good luck. 
  MAN: Stuck in the motion Same old thing day to day Fussin' and groanin', but that won't go pave the way Gotta work hard, fight for your spot Whether you like it or not Gotta work hard, fight for your spot On your rise to the top Oh, one, no one, no, they can't steal my style Whoo! 
  MAN: Run their mouths to suit the crowd Real way, none of that, none of that None of that worth it, yes! 
  How can I not be the best till I run out of breath? 
  I can beat all of the rest Runnin' my life to the death till I run out of [GASP] 
  How can I not be the best? 
  How can I not be the best till I run out of breath? 
  [STARTING PISTOL FIRES] 
  [EXHALES] 
  Yo, when did Chris get so fast? 
  Always has been. 
  This is the first time y'all gone head to head. 
  Yo, who's that dude with cam and Coach King? 
  Brett Hanson. 
  Angeles Southern's number-one booster. 
  He's got half the campus named after him. 
  Now, why are you sweating? 
  Coach king all but said they came here for you, OK? 
  You've had a good day, Spence. 
  Well, it ain't good enough for me, all right? 
  They got they eyes on somebody else now, and I need that Angeles Southern scholarship. 
  What's up, Spence? 
  What's good? 
  Look, I'm thinking it's time we give these guys a show. 
  Let them know what us Crenshaw boys do. 
  We ain't boys, Cam. 
  What's wrong? 
  Thought you liked to compete, big dawg. 
  So, what you got in mind? 
  [APPLAUSE, INDISTINCT CHATTER] 
  Hey. 
  40-yard dash is supposed to be individually timed. 
  Did y'all two goad these boys into making it a race? 
  You know how it is. 
  Football is all about competition. 
  Now, let's give these boys what they want. 
  Set it. 
  All right, fellas! 
  On your marks! 
  [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] 
  MAN: Ready. 
  Set. 
  - Go! 
  - [STARTING PISTOL FIRES] 
  MAN: Soon as that bullet, I'm ready for war Put the pedal to the floor Heavy metal in the background You should know I won't back down When it's go time or it's no time Tell 'em, throw and cut the cord And they just keep telling me more They-they-they-they keep on telling me more [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] 
  MAN: I'm trained to go, and I'm ready for war You ain't gonna like being there, being there When you're looking at - BRETT: That was great, son! 
  - DAMON: Yeah, boy. 
  BRETT: Yeah MAN: So this is going down in history, history I'm trained to go, and I'm ready for war There's a lesson to be learned in all this. 
  Look, you ain't gotta say it, all right? 
  All them coaches, they came here to see you. 
  Yeah, well, it didn't take them long to find somebody they liked better. 
  Why did you take his bait? 
  You let him set it up like it was a head-to-head competition. 
  You just helped raise up his profile. 
  Well, it don't matter. 
  He gonna get that ASU receiver scholarship. 
  You heard what coach king said. 
  They only got one. 
  What happened to wanting to leave your options open? 
  Plans change, all right? 
  - Why? 
  - Because of my moms. 
  She got dreams, too, like finishing school. 
  Look, I've gotta stay close to home, all right, and ASU's local. 
  It's her turn. 
  Look, if Angeles Southern is where you need to be, you need to go out there and show them what I already know. 
  And what's that? 
  That you're the best player out there. 
  It ain't even close. 
  Go on. 
  MEN: Best believe what you've been told Time to get what's mine, 'cause I'm gold All right, let's go, let's go, let's go! 
  All right. 
  BILLY: What'd I say? 
  Ain't even close. 
  Ain't even close. 
  This kid needs to work on his hands. 
  I think you could coach him up. 
  Can't teach size. 
  And you sure as hell can't teach speed. 
  MAN: The light that I bring gets you thinking of Vegas CHRIS: Set! 
  Hut! 
  MAN: Everyone diggin' the earth It's time to go all the way down I see you, Adams. 
  I see you. 
  MAN: Believe what you've been told Time to get what's mine 'cause I'm gold And go! 
  BILLY: Don't hesitate. 
  Don't hesitate. 
  Just throw. 
  Just throw. 
  Just throw. 
  MEN: Oh oh, oh oh, oh oh CAM: Could somebody get me a real QB? 
  What's that fool doing here? 
  MEN: I make it gold, everyone diggin' me [MEN SHOUTING COMMANDS IN DISTANCE] 
  Are you good? 
  Just having an off day. 
  Psh. 
  Happens to the best of us, man. 
  Did you miss a single throw today? 
  [SCOFFS] 
  I mean That's what I thought. 
  You straight-up outplayed me. 
  MAN: Excuse me, gentlemen. 
  Jordan Baker, congratulations. 
  Thank thanks Thanks, Coach. 
  Chris, maybe next year. 
  Chris, I'm I'm really sorry, man. 
  You deserved an invite, too. 
  Yeah. 
  I deserved that one. 
  Wait. 
  Wait. 
  Hol Hold up. 
  You No, man. 
  You said I outplayed you all day. 
  Yeah, man, you got size, strength, but you also got a daddy that played in the NFL, and that right there, man, that's all you'll ever need. 
  But you know, man, it's all good. 
  It's all good, because where I'm from, I'm used to hustling and working twice as hard. 
  And, man, we both know you don't deserve this. 
  But, man, you can keep your privilege. 
  I ain't gonna stop. 
  JJ: Hey. 
  You showed out today. 
  Love, man. 
  I appreciate you, man. 
  Let's hope it was enough. 
  Why, no 7-on-7 invite? 
  Not yet. 
  JJ: Looks like Cam just got his. 
  The kid's a beast. 
  Combine's been over for a while. 
  I'm not ready to leave just yet. 
  [HORN HONKING IN DISTANCE] 
  I miss this Being out here. 
  I didn't appreciate it enough. 
  Well, come back tomorrow for the 7-on-7 game. 
  I'll be here. 
  So will I. 
  Wait. 
  Is that They invited me to play. 
  Asher, that's amazing. 
  I mean, the gold envelope's a bit much. 
  Kind of Willy Wonka, if you ask me, but [LAUGHS] 
  Well, if anyone needed a golden ticket right about now, it was me. 
  This doesn't happen without you. 
  Thank you. 
  OLIVIA: So proud of you. 
  Spencer James. 
  Man, what'd I tell you? 
  That kid has a chance to be special. 
  He already is. 
  Oh, yeah, thanks to you. 
  No. 
  Kid makes me look good. 
  Heh. 
  Now, we both know it's not easy to develop raw talent like that, man. 
  My head coach is impressed. 
  For real? 
  Coach Mack? 
  He should be. 
  Spencer is a once-in-a-generation talent. 
  I'm talking about you, Billy. 
  - BILLY: Say what? 
  - DAMON: Mm-hmm. 
  Coach Mack wants to know if you are interested in coaching at the next level. 
  I'm talking Angeles Southern, man. 
  Billy, think about it, man. 
  We would get to work together, and you could continue to develop Spencer. 
  There it is. 
  - DAMON: What? 
  - BILLY: The package deal. 
  No. 
  no, no, no. 
  That's not what this is, man. 
  No? 
  You are an elite coach, Billy, and we both know that, right? 
  Huh? 
  So. 
  You interested? 
  - Uh Yes. 
  I am. 
  - Ha ha! 
  [GLASSES CLINK] 
  My man. 
  Mm. 
  Listen. 
  I will set something up with you and Mack. 
  Man, this is gonna be fun, bruh. 
  All right. 
  Oh, and, just so I know, any idea which way the kid is leaning? 
  [LAUGHS] 
  Make him an offer. 
  [DOOR CLOSES] 
  Hey, Spencer. 
  You on your way home? 
  - SPENCER: Yeah. 
  - BRETT: Good. 
  Good. 
  Go home. 
  Get dressed up. 
  See you tonight. 
  Thank you. 
  I wanted to deliver that myself instead of Coach King. 
  You know, we got limited space at Angeles Southern. 
  Yes, Sir. 
  We're gonna make room for you. 
  For real? 
  Well, it's not official until you get your offer letter, but, uh, it's on its way. 
  You should know, um, we take care of our own, so, if there's anything you need, anything, you come to me. 
  Yes, Sir. 
  Welcome to ASU, son. 
  So, Chris just left without saying good-bye to you? 
  He's probably just upset about the Combine and I don't know. 
  Maybe he just needs some space. 
  Hmm. 
  Look at you being all understanding. 
  He's my boyfriend. 
  Glad you remembered that. 
  What's that supposed to mean? 
  I can't believe your emergency this morning was saving Asher. 
  He's in a bad place right now. 
  I mean, I've been there, and I was lucky. 
  I mean, what saved me was a family who forced me to get the help that I needed. 
  We just need to be that family for Asher. 
  [DOOR OPENS] 
  Hey, baby. 
  Hey. 
  I got big news. 
  I heard. 
  You did? 
  You got an invite to that 7-on-7 scrimmage. 
  Billy texted me. 
  That's not the big news, Ma. 
  You might want to sit down for this. 
  I'll stand. 
  I'm going to Angeles Southern University. 
  They about to offer me a full ride. 
  That way I can stay close to home, and we can just Angeles Southern? 
  No. 
  You're not making this decision now. 
  It's a good school, ma. 
  We did it. 
  Not good enough. 
  Not for you. 
  Not academically. 
  You worked too hard for this. 
  Yeah, you right. 
  I did work hard for this. 
  That's why it's my decision. 
  Let me stop you right now. 
  You best believe this is our decision. 
  Ma, this full scholarship means you can finish your degree right now. 
  I did not send you to Beverly and quit night school so you could sell your future short. 
  I made those sacrifices You think I like living in somebody else's house? 
  Helping my little brother with his homework over the phone? 
  You not the only one making sacrifices here, all right? 
  I'm gonna need you to take that bass out your voice right now. 
  I'm sorry. 
  But it is my decision. 
  And I decided that ASU is the right place for me. 
  That's it. 
  I'm doing this for you, for Dillon, and me. 
  That's it. 
  Good evening. 
  Uh, can I talk to you for a second? 
  Yeah. 
  Give me a minute, guys. 
  Everything OK? 
  Yeah. 
  All good. 
  I just wanted to thank you for the invitation. 
  Listen Hey, hey. 
  Whatever's in that envelope belongs to you. 
  Keep it. 
  I'm sure that'd be a big help to your mother. 
  It's not easy being the only parent in the house. 
  CAM: Brett Hanson. 
  My dawg. 
  Cam, I thought I missed you. 
  Ha! 
 
 
 
  Nah, man. 
  Just had to make a quick stop. 
  You know, Cinderella don't come to the ball till she gets her glass slippers. 
  BRETT: You're gonna have a lot of fun tonight. 
  You both deserve a little something special after today. 
  So, what, you taking money now? 
  Didn't you? 
  I thought you wanted Angeles Southern. 
  No, I want the scholarship, not the money. 
  OK. 
  Whatever. 
  Do you. 
  Look, one phone call, and you lose your eligibility. 
  That's high school, college. 
  ASU already got what they need to keep you, dawg. 
  That money ain't a gift. 
  It's leverage so you gotta commit. 
  I ain't stupid. 
  I know what this is, and I'm good with it. 
  So, when they give me that scholarship, I'm gonna take it. 
  So, you're cool with being bought and paid for? 
  I ain't got no fairy godfather in Beverly Hills. 
  I just got football. 
  So, I'm gonna use it for what I can get as long as I can. 
  That's the game. 
  Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm going to go get me one of them tiny-ass plates. 
  OLIVIA: Dad, you have a visitor. 
  All right, let's make this quick, son. 
  I'm already late for the showcase dinner. 
  Yes, Sir. 
  I, um I wanted to thank you. 
  I know that I let you down at homecoming. 
  I just I really appreciate you giving me this chance. 
  OK, well, you're welcome. 
  Junior college coach even expressed interest today. 
  Thinks I can go on to a D-I school. 
  All right. 
  Since he didn't say anything, I'm guessing you didn't tell the coaches that I was kicked off the team. 
  They didn't ask. 
  But, uh, understand this. 
  If someone does ask me directly, I ain't lying for you. 
  One more thing. 
  Olivia has fought really hard to get her life back together. 
  And now she seems determined to help you do the same. 
  Do not drag her back down with you. 
  Do not. 
  She sees something in you, Ash. 
  Please prove her right. 
  I appreciate you guys on that. 
  Thanks. 
  I appreciate that. 
  Good to see you. 
  - Great work today. 
  - You, too. 
  See you. 
  Yeah. 
  Hey, Coach. 
  Mm. 
  To a great Combine. 
  Or maybe we can toast the next great ASU quarterback, Jordan Baker. 
  [GLASSES CLINK] 
  [CHUCKLES] 
  What did you want me to say? 
  OK, look, you did fine today, OK? 
  You have all the necessary tools, man. 
  You got a strong arm. 
  You're a smart kid. 
  OK, but? 
  Something's holding you back. 
  I mean, great players, they just play, but you, you hesitate under pressure. 
  And you gotta figure out why for yourself. 
  What do you think? 
  I'm I'm sorry. 
  What did you say? 
  I just asked if Coach Baker's planning to use you any differently in the playoffs. 
  Yeah. 
  I, uh maybe. 
  You haven't been game planning? 
  No, we we have. 
  No, Coach and I Actually, I was hoping to transfer to Malibu next year. 
  Is this about Baker bringing in the kid from Crenshaw? 
  No. 
  it's not. 
  It's because I got myself kicked off the team. 
  BILLY: We hear congratulations are in order. 
  I don't know about all that. 
  What? 
  Did you change your mind about committing to Angeles Southern? 
  I found two Gs in my invitation envelope. 
  What'd you do with it? 
  Tried to give it back to Hanson. 
  He wouldn't take it. 
  A booster? 
  Are you sure? 
  He didn't bother with seeming surprised. 
  Look, I can't lose this scholarship. 
  All right. 
  Clean programs, they don't want boosters putting their players' eligibility at risk, so I'll handle this. 
  Say. 
  Hey. 
  What's going on, brother? 
  There's something I think you should see. 
  Let's talk about it. 
  Wait. 
  So, you know about the money. 
  There's been a misunderstanding. 
  Hanson gave a potential recruit money. 
  It's that simple. 
  Baker, this is only a big deal if you turn it into one. 
  Payoffs. 
  Booster gifts. 
  That's how the recruiting game is played. 
  You are putting these kids' futures at stake, their families' futures. 
  The only futures at risk here are yours and Spencer's. 
  Whistleblowers get coaches fired, and a kid like that can't be controlled, and that kind of trouble isn't worth the risk to us. 
  So, if the James kid really wants to join our program, you get that boy to play ball. 
  Well, if you think that I'm gonna let you compromise Spencer or any of my boys, you got another think coming. 
  Hmm. 
  Man, boy. 
  Then I guess the James kid isn't Angeles Southern material. 
  And neither are you. 
  SPENCER: Coach King can do that? 
  Just not let me play after I earned it? 
  I'm not the coach here. 
  So, what, I'm just supposed to stand there? 
  What do I do if another recruiter asks? 
  You're gonna say you're injured and that you can't play. 
  Come on, man. 
  Ain't no way. 
  Yeah. 
  I'm sorry, Spencer, but you did really well yesterday, and the scouts will remember that. 
  But if you end up suiting up, then people are gonna ask questions, and even though you did nothing wrong, those questions are gonna end up being marks against you. 
  How is this fair? 
  It's not, son. 
  It's not fair. 
  OLIVIA: Look, I know it sucks not making the cut, but, I mean, you just disappeared on me. 
  Wasn't just the 7-on-7. 
  Are you gonna tell me, then, because if you don't, I'm gonna think it's me. 
  Oh, it is me. 
  It's just this was a big weekend for me. 
  You know? 
  And you're with Asher the whole time. 
  You know there's nothing between me and Asher, right? 
  OK, ah, I know that, all right? 
  All I'm saying is, yesterday was tough, and it just sucks that I have to disappear for you to see all that. 
  OK, you know what? 
  Forget it. 
  I shouldn't have even said nothing. 
  No, no, hey, I'm glad you did, and I'm I'm sorry I didn't see how hard yesterday was for you because I've I've never seen you shaken. 
  Not by gunshots or slut-shaming. 
  I'll look harder next time, and as for Asher Nah, I know y'all been cool for a minute. 
  Yeah, no, it's not that. 
  Last year, I didn't ask for help, and it almost cost me my life. 
  You mean when when you were an addict? 
  It's not a past-tense thing. 
  Um I didn't stop being an addict when I stopped using, and a part of how I deal with that is by helping others. 
  Like Asher. 
  I get it if you don't want to be a part of that or if I'm, like, too complicated or I can't like you for your heart and be mad when you use it. 
  [CHUCKLES SOFTLY] 
  [PHONE CHIMING] 
  Sorry. 
  You're good. 
  You're good. 
  [CHIMING] 
  - OLIVIA: Heh. 
  - CHRIS: Hey. 
  Do your thing. 
  All right. 
  It's all good. 
  [CHIMES] 
  Ma? 
  What are you doing here? 
  What are you doing? 
  ASU coach won't let me play. 
  Billy already told me. 
  Doesn't explain why you leaving. 
  Look, if the scouts think I'm injured, they won't think I'm trouble. 
  Since when do you care what other people think? 
  You've given up so much for me. 
  I wanted the scholarship for you. 
  The same way you want what's best for me, I want what's best for you, too. 
  Ma, your dreams are important, too. 
  Yes, our dreams are important, but not at the expense of who we are. 
  You did the right thing not compromising yourself for a scholarship, but I'll be damned if I let you back down. 
  Don't play that game. 
  Play yours. 
  Asher? 
  You in here? 
  ASHER: Your dad would kill you if he knew you were in the locker room. 
  Well, I wanted to check in. 
  I'm sorry they cut you from the showcase. 
  I knew honesty had its consequences. 
  Never really believed you about the rewards, though. 
  Rewards? 
  What happened? 
  I'm back on the team. 
  What? 
  What? 
  Why didn't you tell me? 
  It just happened. 
  Your dad said that me telling that coach the truth, it showed him that I was finally willing to own my crap. 
  You know, take accountability. 
  Olivia, thank you. 
  No, I didn't do anything. 
  Yeah. 
  You did. 
  OK, well, I'm not done yet. 
  Asher, you can't keep sleeping in your car for a gazillion reasons, but I think I have a solution. 
  [WHISTLE BLOWS] 
  Yo, coach's son keeps overthrowing me, man. 
  I told y'all he ain't no real QB. 
  BILLY: You gonna let him talk to you like that? 
  Yeah, he's right, OK? 
  What you mean, he's right? 
  He ain't right. 
  Easy. 
  It wasn't perfect, but Th there's no "but" after "it wasn't perfect," OK? 
  Hold up. 
  What's that supposed to mean? 
  It means stop patronizing me and start pushing me to be the best. 
  OK, Grandpa Willie was right. 
  I'm I'm not ready for all this. 
  I warned you about letting that man get inside your head, boy. 
  Dad, would I have even made the showcase if I wasn't your son? 
  Look, even if that did play a role, and that's a big "if," what matters is what you do with the opportunity. 
  SPENCER: Hey. 
  Hey. 
  What the hell are you doing? 
  Get in there and own your spot, man. 
  Keep firing. 
  It ain't on you if cam won't go up and get it. 
  Thought you were injured or whatever. 
  Look, scouts can think what they want. 
  If coach king won't give me a chance, then that's on him, but I'mma be right here. 
  And when I do get my shot, ain't nobody forgetting about me. 
  You know what? 
  To hell with this. 
  Both y'all get warm. 
  You're gonna get another shot at that next series. 
  Go. 
  Go. 
  Let's do it. 
  All right. 
  What the hell is going on? 
  Jordan and Spencer are gonna play in this next series. 
  And if not, I'm going straight to the NCAA. 
  I'm gonna start whispers about there being a dirty coach at ASU. 
  I'm wondering how much longer that program's gonna protect you once I start giving interviews to ESPN about how you're making payoffs. 
  You won't ever coach again. 
  Excuse me. 
  BOY: Fight the D. 
  Wide, hut! 
  [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] 
  BILLY: Whoo. 
  - JORDAN: Money. 
  - BILLY: OK. 
  [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE ON VIDEO] 
  Ha! 
  That's a damn fine play, yo. 
  No, dad, that's all Spence. 
  Yo, those views for real? 
  Yeah, man. 
  250,000 and climbing. 
  BILLY: What? 
  Did you post that? 
  Uh-uh. 
  Got posted to some recruitment site. 
  We didn't even know about it till JJ hit us up. 
  Yeah. 
  Ah. 
  Explains why I got a call first thing this morning from the S. E. C. 
  scout asking about you. 
  - SPENCER: For real? 
  - BILLY: Uh-huh. 
  'Cause of the video? 
  No. 
  When one big dog starts sniffing around, you can expect the rest close behind. 
  Well done, y'all. 
  Yeah. 
  - Whoa! 
  - Appreciate you. 
  - Way to get it done. 
  - Want to see it again? 
  Yeah. 
  Wait a minute. 
  You want me to do what? 
  OLIVIA: Asher's homeless, and you have a big, empty house just sitting here. 
  It makes sense. 
  You serious right now? 
  There's gotta be somewhere else he can stay other than my house. 
  His dad kicked him out. 
  He's living in his car. 
  He has no one and, look, yes, he's made some mistakes, OK? 
  All four of us have. 
  But somehow, he's the only one still paying for it. 
  It's your house, and I trust you. 
  [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE ON VIDEO] 
  Yeah. 
  That's it? 
  If you want me to tell you I was wrong about you being ready I want you to tell me what you see. 
  That's not a throw, Jordan. 
  It's a catch, Spencer's catch. 
  I know it, and any scout worth his salt will know it, too. 
  - JORDAN: OK. 
  - WILLIE: Ok what? 
  OK, I want you to train me. 
  Why? 
  It took me a while to realize how much the game meant to me. 
  OK? 
  that I wanted it for me and not my dad, but now I know. 
  I want to be great, and you're the only one who's ever held me to that standard. 
  You need to be sure, kid. 
  Ain't gonna baby you. 
  Ain't got no time for no whining. 
  I don't coach like your daddy. 
  You're likely to hate me before we're done. 
  Understand? 
  Yes, Sir. 
  You sure about this? 
  You know where the guest bedroom is. 
  WOMAN: When I first laid eyes on you And I heard your heartbeat, too Well, I never knew I could witness An angel so beautiful From the very moment you arrived I felt something new inside So, what's the special occasion? 
  Chicken pot pie's a dead giveaway. 
  Wow. 
  Didn't even realize I did that. 
  Heh! 
  Yes. 
  I wanted to do something special for you two. 
  What for? 
  Well, Spencer helped me realize something yesterday. 
  Not only am I your mother, I'm also a member of this family. 
  And in this family, we don't let each other settle for anything less than what we deserve. 
  And if I'm gonna ask that of you, I have to ask that of myself, too. 
  So, today I picked up this financial aid package from the college. 
  To be honest, it's not enough. 
  I'm gonna need your help. 
  But if we agree that this is what's best for all of us, for this family, I promise to try to do what you two do every day Make something special of every opportunity that you give me. 
  We're in. 
  Adult Education Grant application. 
  But that ain't nothing. 
  I got a hookup with Mrs. 
  G's after-school program. 
  If I help out with the little kids there, you don't have to pick me up till 7:45. 
  Totally free. 
  Hey, don't look at me. 
  That was all D. 
  Dillon, you never had a Ms. 
  G. 
  How do you know her? 
  Well, Spencer isn't the only James brother who got game. 
  - SPENCER: Shut up! 
  - GRACE: You know what? 
  WOMAN: Hold on to my hand And never let me go To mama's hand And never let it go Hold on to my hand, oh ooh oh oh-oh
