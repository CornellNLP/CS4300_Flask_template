 You're going to get out of Troy, do you understand me? 
 Mm-hmm. 
 I'm going with her. 
 Does she really want to go with me, or is she using me to get where she's going? 
 I'm sorry, I'm not going to be there. 
 I don't just clean toilets. 
 You change the rolls too, don't you? 
 Anything that may endanger my recovery, lock it away or lose it. 
 What recovery is that, Hol? 
 I've given up fur. 
 Antoine's back! 
 Antoine! What I am supposed to do? 
 And you can take him. 
 All this time you've been a border guard, you've been a half-breed? 
 I'm half human, half alien. 
 Aghhhh! 
 You're stabbed! Just head to the checkpoint. 
 I ain't dying in this shithole. 
 Garvey! 
 What you barbecuing your clothes for? 
 It's not even nice weather for it. 
 Feeling remorseful, are you? For crimes against shirts? 
 There's loads I would've burnt before that one. 
 Listen, have you got 30 quid I could borrow? 
 I've got that. 
 A fiver? 
 Well, that explains the woebegone b*st*rd vibe you're giving off. 
 You know, you need to spend less time perfecting your grilling technique, more time grappling with your finances. 
 (f*cking hell.) 
 Garvey, come with me. 
 What's going on? 
 There's been a body found. They're saying it's Truss.

 I know. w*nk*r was dirty all along. 
 I mean, tell me that's not a fur deal gone wrong. 
 Five years I work with that. 
 Chief, we don't know for sure, I mean, yeah, it looks bad... 
 Don't defend him to me. Any bond between officers he's broken. 
 Do you know he tried to pass off suspicion onto you? 
 He came up to me two weeks ago. "Keep an eye on Garvey." 
 Total scumbag. 
 Say it. 
 In my defence, Fab... 
 Say it. 
 Another one from the human side went over to Antoine. 
 Third one this week. 
 Why is this happening? 
 Someone explain to me why this keeps happening. 
 You have lost your monopoly. 
 Used to be the dealers had to take whatever you gave them but now, Antoine's offering them more. 
 And they feel safe going over to him because he got a big operation up and running fast. 
 Around the same time you decided to have a marathon group s*x session. 
 This is the kind of plain speaking I have craved. 
 That orgy was his idea and it was a horrible mistake. 
 I'm haunted now by images of his asshole peeping out at me from around corners. 
 She's spot-on about those dealers. They need a talking-to. 
 As for that latest defector, I want you to make an example of him. 
 By killing him. 
 See if that reminds the others of the terms of their verbal contract. 
 No problem, Fab. I'll send Henri. 
 "No problem, Fab, I'll send..." I don't care who you send. 
 I've got a dwindling sales force. I've got product stacked up on the shelves. 
 I'm supposed to fight a war with no war chest, am I? 
 That's no problem too, is it? 
 I know a girl on the human side that could help us with that. 
 Terrific. Sign her up. 
 You know what? The more she's around, the more I wonder what we ever did without her. 
 I do, I do! I do do that, Lewis. 
 I can't believe you noticed that about me. 
 You're noticing so much about me. 
 Ahh! Can I just say, I'm so pleased you came over? 
 I was quite nervous asking you on the phone. 
 I know, obviously, right? 
 I don't know. I just thought you'd laugh, I suppose. 
 But it all, er, it all seems so silly. Doesn't it? 
 When, er... when, er... here you are. 
 So, um... what'll we do now? 
 Hello, mate. Window cleaner. The name's Henri. Did they not tell you I was coming? 
 No. 
 HJB Solutions. 
 Yeah? 
 Who's your supervisor? 
 Um, Abigail. She didn't say anything about a window cleaner. 
 That's typical Abigail, though, isn't it? 
 I just don't want you to have to explain to the client why he's coming home to dirty windows, you know. 
 You know what humans are like. 
 Yeah, yeah. 
 Sweet. 
 I mean, I can window-clean. 
 I'm, er, I'm fully versed in, in windows. 
 Yeah. Sorry I was, ah... sorry I was a bit paranoid then. 
 No, you're all right. 
 This is my new job on the human side. 
 I mostly work at the checkpoint. 
 But, um, you know, I thought why not spread my wings, try something new. 
 I mean, I'm not tied to the place, am I ? So, er, yeah. This is me, um, spreading my wings. 
 What are you doing? 
 f*ck it. 
 You're not a window cleaner. 
 Um, er, in terms of HJB Solutions, as a representative of the organisation... 
 Stop talking! 
 No. I cannot let you do this. I forbid it! 
 I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I draw the line! 
 What was that for?! 
 What was...? You've just shot at someone! 
 I been going around cleaning while you're shooting at people! 
 I would not like to be in your shoes right now, mate. 
 I was sent here by Fabien. 
 Ah, so NOT Abigail. 
 Wait. Fabien? 
 You just made the mistake of your life, my friend. 
 That was one of Fabien's dealers he wanted taken out. 
 Fabien says he wants someone taken out, he expects them to get taken out. Do you understand that? 
 Well, I won't do it again. 
 It's too late now, mate. 
 I can't do the job now, you let the target see me. 
 This is your mess, you clean it up. 
 You don't mean clean the gun? 
 I mean do the hit! 
 Look man, I'm a cleaner. 
 I do surfaces, I do hoovering. 
 I don't... kill people. 
 You either do it or you go back to Troy and explain to Fabien why you didn't. 
 I can't. 
 There's supposed to be two of us, that's the protocol. 
 I can't do it. 
 We have to show face, Garvey. He had a wife and kids. 
 Yes, Eli. Nicely away. 
 Here you are, good news. 
 Sweeties! 
 Eli! 
 Hiya. 
 Go away, you're embarrassing. 
 f*ck off. No, I'm not. 
 I'm going to get you the official strip. 
 Arsenal away kit, yeah? 
 I tried to top meself because of you. Did anyone tell you that? 
 See you at the weekend, then, yeah? 
 Let's talk. 
 Try any more of that "bury us alive" sh1t and I will beat you severely. 
 I have a business proposition. 
 Yeah, but, it's too late. I'm clean. 
 I don't want you to smoke it, I want you to sell it. 
 Sorry, not interested. 
 Got a long history of mixing business with pleasure on that front, so... 
 I can see you really want to get your life together this time. 
 Trouble is, you can't change your life on no money. 
 How much? 
 Nothing now. 
 Sell what's there and next time you can pay me up front. 
 It's all bagged up, you can get started straight away. 
 We are looking for a quick turnaround. 
 It's me. 
 'It's good to hear from you. Coming over?' 
 Let me talk. 
 'I've had enough. I'm done with this. Someone died in front of me.' 
 He had a wife, he had kids. 
 I've destroyed their lives. 
 'Wait. You didn't kill him.' 
 No, but it's my fault. He wouldn't have been in Troy if it weren't for me. 
 Lewis, you had no choice. 
 Don't interrupt me, please! 
 'Don't say anything.' 
 Everything I go near gets wrecked. 
 'It's too much. I just want it done with.' 
 Lewis, don't do this... 
 I'm handing myself in. 
 Lewis, don't do it. Lewis... 
 You're on notice. 
 Anyone selling hair, sells to Fabien. 
 Go elsewhere and you know what to expect. 
 This is the final warning for anyone thinking of selling your hair... you don't change sides. 
 There's only one side. Me! 
 He decided he didn't want to work for Antoine after all. 
 Didn't you? 
 Well, we went over your options. 
 See you Monday morning. 
 Next. 
 Where's Holly? 
 You missed her. 
 She's on early starts these days. 
 I wanted to tell her something. 
 I can get a message to her if you like. 
 If it's about loading the dishwasher, though, I think... it might be wasted words at this stage. 
 I'm going to go now. 
 Hmm? 
 Yeah, I know, Lewis. 
 Have a good day. 
 Are you going to be OK, Dad? 
 Yeah, of course, yeah. 
 You know what you're doing and that? 
 Yeah, I'm sorting the remote. 
 Oh, thank God for that. 
 Heard you might be able to help us out. 
 How much? 
 Like, 20 quid. 
 All right. 
 You know what I'm going to say next, don't you? 
 Have identity cards ready for inspection. 
 I need to talk to you. 
 Well, how pressing is it? 
 On top of the Truss situation, we just got word there's a drug war kicking off in Troy. 
 It's pressing. 
 Right, well, it'll have to be later, OK? 
 Yeah, all right. 
 Who's your supplier? 
 Anonymous stranger. 
 Yesterday, we found the body of a murder victim. 
 There were lots of these little "F" bags all around him. 
 I didn't do it. 
 Where did you get this? 
 I told you I found it in a bush near me house. 
 You stop doing that. 
 You think for a second. 
 This is morks. 
 It's bigger than you. 
 Now, I'd rather put one of them away any day of the week. 
 But if you make me settle for you, I will. 
 It's entirely your decision. 
 Do you want to help yourself? 
 Do you want to see your kid again outside a prison visiting room? 
 Arrange a meet. 
 ♪ I knew it must have been some big setup ♪ 
♪ Our action just would not let up. ♪ 
 Why you following me? 
 I don't know what you're talking about. 
 You just took the same three right turns as me. 
 This where you was heading, was it? 
 Can I buy some drugs...please? 
 Not here. 
 First rule of war is never leave your things where the other fella can get them. 
 You take your corn and your doubloons inside the castle. 
 This is all normal war stuff. 
 Second rule is don't look so worried. 
 I'm giving pertinent advice over here. 
 Ten years from now he's in a conflict situation. 
 What did Dad say again? 
 Oh, yeah, that's it, "Block of fur." Start another stack. 
 Positive expressions, mate, yeah? Keep morale high. 
 All right to re-up? 
 My contact on the human-side needs a redelivery. 
 Look at that, got the lingo and everything. 
 Take as much as you want. 
 Oi, Henri, over here. 
 See the pictures? 
 Of the hit? Did Guy not tell you I usually see pictures? 
 Guy! 
 Henri's just telling me about the hit I asked you to sort. 
 Well, the thing is, Fabien, about that hit, it's not actually done as of yet. 
 He's in the process of doing it, though. 
 And he's who? Just for me. 
 Just for my own records. 
 Dominic. 
 The cleaner bloke. 
 Did you not send him? 
 I did, yeah. 
 He sent you. 
 Yeah, I know. 
 I got spotted. So... 
 So, you came back? 
 Aaaghhhh. 
 How am I suppose to win a war without any heroes? 
 Everyone's delegating. 
 Who's going to step up? 
 Who? 
 Go back, kill the dealer, kill this Dominic if you have to. 
 f*cking shower. 
 I tell you something now, boys, I better be receiving a photo message of a dead dealer on my phone in the next two hours, do you understand me? 
 Yes, Fabien. Yes, Fabien. 
 Cos if I don't, I'll start taking snaps of my own. 
 Hold it. 
 Look, stop. Stop. 
 Now, you... are not the easiest person in the world to get in contact with, are you? 
 Well, you told me you'd kill me if you saw me again. 
 So I thought it'd be a good idea to stay out of your way. 
 Lewis is going to give himself up. 
 Problem is he's not talking to me, so I need you to go down to the checkpoint and talk to him for me. 
 OK? 
 Get him to call me. 
 How much are you after? 
 A ki. 
 You serious? 
 No. I'm just messing you about. 
 You want an eighth? 
 Yes, please. 
 25. 
 Is that all I get for ?25? 
 Would you like to measure it? No. 
 No. I'm sure it's worth every penny. 
 That's banging. 
 Thank you. 
 Oh, payment, yes, no problem. 
 What? 
 You didn't follow me to buy drugs, did you? 
 Did you want to get out of here? 
 Sure. 
 Davide, I said set the table. 
 Yeah, in a minute. 
 I just moved in. 
 I'm the first tenant in the entire complex. 
 It's going to be very nice. 
 It's getting there. 
 I'm going for soulless and clinical. 
 Yeah. 
 Oh. 
 Cheers. 
 I love relaxing. 
 Thank you for this excellent sh1t. 
 It's the wrong way round, no? 
 (Blowback.) 
 Oh. 
 More for me. Delicious. 
 Anyone ever told you you're incredibly fuckable? 
 Ah, well, not, not in real life, no. 
 I want to dig my fingernails into your bum cheeks, run my nose through your pubic hair... 
 Sean, can we leave, like, loads to the imagination? 
 Ahh! 
 Toilet! The toilet? 
 Thanks. 
 Tags must be clearly visible at all times. 
 I'll take this one. 
 Arms wide, please, against the fence. 
 Antoine told me what you're planning. Don't do it. 
 I've already made up my mind. Then change it cos it's a bad idea. 
 They'll put you in alien detention or they'll kill you and out of the two, killing is probably better. 
 Look, will you tell Antoine... 
 Oh, forget Antoine. I'm telling you. 
 I was waiting for you at the Tunnel. 
 You said you weren't there. 
 Idiot, I was lying. 
 They are going to make your friend do a hit. 
 A dealer on the human-side. He's going to do it now. 
 191 Ashdown House. 
 Garvey. 
 Yeah, we'll do it later. 
 I'm ready? Good, because I'm always ready.

 Open the door. 
 What did you do? 
 Lewis. 
 No, Dominic. 
 I know. 
 You killed him. 
 I didn't. 
 No? 
 Did I? 
 No. No. 
 I didn't. 
 I thought it would be easier to kill him whilst he was unconscious, but it's not. It actually makes it so unfair. 
 God, I'm stuck, Lewis. This is hard. 
 I've been here 20 minutes, you know? 
 f*cking hell. 
 Ah! I can't do it. 
 I am the world's worst procrastinator at the best of times, but this... this is killing someone. 
 I'm never going to get round to that, am I? 
 How did this happen? Why are you here in the first place? 
 Hi. This is Lewis. 
 He's, erm... 
 Argh! Sean. 
 Argh! Sean. Sean! 
 Two morks are going to murder me! 
 Sean, you're the only tenant in the building. 
 Nobody knows you're here. All right? OK? 
 I've got cash. There's keys to a BMW in my jacket. Take it. 
 Take the jacket. You'll be the smartest morks in Troy. 
 I really, really want to know how this started. 
 OK, OK. This is Lewis. 
 Lewis is a good friend of mine - which you are, by the way. 
 He's come to help us with this little situation, which... which will be all finished up real soon, OK? 
 We'll finish up real soon, Sean. 
 Oh, God. 
 I promise, Sean, OK? I know. I'm sorry. 
 Why did you kiss me, you sick f*ck? 
 You...! 
 Look, we won't take any of your things, all right? 
 We'll leave everything just as you would've wanted. 
 Right, come with me, now! We're having a quick word, Dominic. 
 Let's go. 
 Hurry up. 
 Thanks again for coming. 
 Tell me from the start what happened. 
 Nothing's going on, all right? 
 OK, look, at first I was flattered and then excited so I went with it. 
 But as it went on, there was this creeping loneliness to it. 
 Plus, he's a terrible kisser, you know? 
 OK. Very scoopy. I don't care about how he kisses. 
 Why are you a hit man? 
 Because I sabotaged the original hit. 
 So now I have to do it. That's the rule, apparently. 
 Did you know that? 
 So you're going to kill him? 
 Not out of choice! 
 They specifically said that if I didn't do it then they're going to kill me, and I have a massive fear of death, Lewis. You know, the void? 
 It can't come too late for me. 
 Help! Somebody f*cking help me! 
 No! No, no, no, no. 
 That's not helping anyone, Sean. 
 Right, so, Fabien has put a contract out on him. 
 So him being dead is a given. We know that coming in. 
 All that matters now is who does it. 
 Now that you're here, I finally feel like I can do this. 
 I didn't come here to help you kill him. Just moral support, then. 
 All I have to do is just pick up the gun, do it and it's done. 
 OK? It's done. 
 Come on! Come on, give me a pep talk, here. I need a pep talk. 
 Dominic, violence leaves a stain and it never goes away. 
 Bad so far. I'm not letting you do this to yourself, Dominic. 
 You're the only clean person I know. This will ruin you. 
 Doh! God! I almost had it. 
 I was so close. 
 OK, so... Fabien kills me and then I'm dead. 
 It's fine. 
 What? It's OK. I can do this. It doesn't make any difference. 
 Yes, it does. What do you mean, it doesn't make any difference? 
 I killed someone already. 
 I'm finished. I'm handing myself in. 
 What? 
 I'm supposed to be doing it now. 
 But this is good. I can do this one last thing before I go. 
 You're a sh1t friend. 
 Eh? 
 I'm sorry, you are. 
 You're not a very good friend. You're a selfish person. 
 What did you think, Lewis? 
 Did you think your life is a story all about you? 
 Huh? What am I supposed to do without you, Lewis? 
 It's either this or they kill you! 
 He's already dead. I'm already f*cked, OK? 
 No! I'm ruined, Dominic. 
 Fuuuuuuu...! Block it out. Block it out, yeah? 
 sh1t! 
 So, shooting's out. 
 Money. 
 I see what's happening. 
 You just remember you did this. 
 It was your stupid decision that made this happen. 
 Holly, that cop arrests me, the first thing out my mouth is how they should run tests on a border guard I know, how that way they'll find out he's half mork. 
 Yeah, we are really pressed for time, so you're going to have to work this out really quickly. 
 How do you think he got into Troy to rescue you? 
 Done. Yeah? 
 You can't use any credit cards and you can't contact any friends or family, Facebook, e-mails, none of that. 
 And if you see a news crew operating outside, don't stand behind the reporter and wave at the camera. 
 Yeah, and you probably have to get out of the drugs business. 
 Retrain. I've packed you a bag. 
 You're supposed to be at the bottom of a river, Sean. 
 You wouldn't have taken much with you. This is a whole fresh start. 
 I just moved in. 
 Yeah, I know this is a major inconvenience but Lewis has redeemed himself. 
 He felt very responsible for the death of a guy. No. 
 We can't talk about that, but you were supposed to die today and now you don't because of him. 
 Lilyhot. 
 'No, I'm sat right next to her.' 
 Holly? 
 She's just told me you're half mork. 
 Of course it's not true. She's completely insane. 
 Everything that comes out of her mouth is a lie. 
 I am not half alien. 
 He's a sh1t liar. 
 So, now you have to make a decision. 
 You OK? 
 You lost? 
 Look, let me help you. 
 OK, it's going to be like that. 
 Mate... 
 Listen lad, just calm down. 
 It'll be all right. 
 Where the f*ck did he come from? 
 Do you know who that is? 
 That's Fabien's kid. 
 We have won the lottery here. 
 You all right? 
 Ahh, he's pissed himself! 
 Don't listen to him. 
 If you've never pissed yourself, then it means you haven't tried to pull any scary moves, eh? 
 See when I was your age, I pissed myself at least twice a week. 
 Hey. 
 Tell me. 
 Did you do this on your own? 
 Give you that, boy, you've got some balls on you. 
 What do you want to do with him? 
 We're going to take him home. 
 What? 
 We've got Fabien by the bollocks here. You don't take him home. 
 Gaspard, why don't you go down to lost property... and get that wee lad a nice dry pair of trousers. Go on. 
 That's the wrong move. 
 The old Antoine wouldn't have thought twice about taking him down. 
 Start the car. Take him home. 
 Now, away you go. 
 Yeah. 
 You all right? 
 I got your call. 
 Solicitor reckons two years. 
 sh1t, Hol. That f*cking... 
 I'm done with her. 
 You should be down on your knees thanking me. 
 I wanted to tell you before. 
 Bollocks. 
 Is that right? 
 When? This morning. 
 You weren't there. 
 I was going to hand myself in. 
 You are not handing anything anywhere. 
 You're staying put and you're looking out for Ely. 
 There's 800 quid in my room from yesterday. That's for him. 
 And... you're going to stay and look after Dad, as well. 
 That's the deal, OK? 
 OK. 
 Look at me. 
 Look what I'm doing. 
 Sacrificing my freedom so that my half-mork brother who, yeah, he might be better than me at being a primary carer, despite what he's done, despite who he is, I still have some feeling for... goes free. 
 I'm doing this for everyone except me. 
 You should be gazing at me in awe. 
 (She sniffs) 
 I am. 
 This is a new one. 
 Hugging a mork. 
 Hiya. 
 How you doing? 
 Look, where are you? 
 I've been trying to reach you, Lewis. 
 This better not be your allocated phone call. Is it? 
 Nah. I'm still here. 
 I was all set, but I couldn't do it in the end. 
 Thank Christ. What changed your mind? 
 Wasn't able to say goodbye. 
 People need me. 
 Listen, Lewis, keep out of Troy for the moment. 
 I'm trying to make things right with Fabien. 
 The bosses decide they're going to go up against each other, and we run away and hide like we always do, while they ruin Troy. 
 When the humans aren't stepping on us, then the gangsters are. 
 They're all part of the same problem. 
 This war between Antoine and Fabien is killing our people. 
 All this time you've been a border guard, you've been a half-breed...mixed something? 
 Half human, half alien. 
 Look who I found in Holly's room. 
 Hello. 
 I have to see Antoine. 
 You need to stay away from Troy. 
 No, I'm not! He needs my help. 
 I want you to go to Fabien and tell him I'm ready to talk. 
 I'm half human, half alien. 
 Get a message to Antoine. Tell him I'd love to talk. 
 But this is the opportunity to get Troy back off the gangsters! 
 TROY BELONGS TO US! 
 I have a plan and I'm going to see it through. 
 When all of this is over you are not going to feel the same way about me.
