 FADE IN: INT. LIBERTY DINER - DAY 
 Pan across various dishes at the counter then over to a booth. Brian on the left, Michael and Emmett on the right. They're eating breakfast, subdued. 
 MICHAEL [VO] 
 In case you weren't there, I gotta tell ya, last Saturday night at Babylon was ... to die for. 
 EMMETT [OS] 
 Would somebody please say something? 
 MICHAEL 
 Okay. So it's late, and I'm leaving Babylon and there's this really hot guy. 
 FLASH CUT: INT. BABYLON - NIGHT 
 Dancing go-go boys. Michael appears in the crowd. A second later, HOT GUY comes up from behind and starts talking. Michael turns his head toward him and grins. 
 MICHAEL [VO] 
 And he's, like, perfect. 
 FLASH CUT: INT. LIBERTY DINER - DAY 
 BRIAN 
 How perfect? 
 MICHAEL 
 Perfect. And we end up ... [takes a bite of eggs] at my place. 
 FLASH CUT: INT. MICHAEL'S APARTMENT - NIGHT 
 Standing in the living room, Michael is kissing Hot Guy's neck. 
 HOT GUY 
 So I work with emotionally disturbed kids, and I really love it. And I'm the captain of the gay water polo team. 
 MICHAEL 
 You're really well-rounded. 
 He squeezes Hot Guy's ass. 
 FLASH CUT: INT. LIBERTY DINER - DAY 
 MICHAEL 
 So, we're making out, and in my mind I'm picturing him in a Speedo with a flag on it. 
 FLASH CUT: INT. MICHAEL'S APARTMENT - NIGHT 
 HOT GUY 
 Oh, say, have you ever been to Brazil? 
 MICHAEL 
 Um, n-no. Have you? 
 He unbuckles Hot Guy's belt/pants. 
 HOT GUY 
 I just came back. It's fabulous. 
 Michael whips his own shirt off over his head. 
 MICHAEL 
 Great beaches, I hear. 
 He goes to his knees. 
 HOT GUY 
 Yeah. Only, they have these things. 
 MICHAEL 
 Things? 
 HOT GUY 
 Parasite things. They live in the sand and they sort of ... burrow themselves right up in there. 
 Michael quickly stands, freaked. 
 MICHAEL [VO] 
 He had them. 
 FLASH CUT: INT. LIBERTY DINER - DAY 
 MICHAEL 
 Brazilian beach parasites, in his ass. 
 Emmett laughs. 
 EMMETT 
 Oh, god. Well, at least you found out before you got too far. 
 Michael shudders. 
 BRIAN 
 [to Emmett] What about you? 
 EMMETT 
 We were just getting started. 
 FLASH CUT: INT. WEIRD GUY'S BEDROOM 
 We follow the camera across a blood red bedroom filled with a hundred lit candles, a leather/metal-clad torso dummy, whips on the wall, white bed and a chain headboard. A bald man in leathers and spiked metal collar, WEIRD GUY, is fitting Emmett into a leather body harness. 
 EMMETT 
 I feel like a 1991 Madonna video. Uh, do you have this in a size larger? 
 Weird Guy cinches the back of the harness hard, rocking Emmett. 
 WEIRD GUY 
 Can we hurry this along? I've got a bride and groom to do in the morning. 
 EMMETT 
 So you're bi? 
 WEIRD GUY 
 No. They're dead. Car crash. 
 He pushes Emmett onto the bed and grabs his legs in the air. 
 FLASH CUT: INT. LIBERTY DINER - DAY 
 MICHAEL 
 You went home with... 
 EMMETT 
 An undertaker. Mm-hmm. 
 BRIAN 
 I f*cked an undertaker once. 
 MICHAEL 
 You did? When? 
 BRIAN 
 He told me sometimes they sew the mouths shut. 
 EMMETT 
 What about you, Brian? What'd you do? 
 Long pause. 
 FLASH CUT: INT. LOFT - NIGHT 
 A nude Justin sits on the bed, watching an equally nude Brian walk toward him. Brian drops onto his knees on the bed and they kiss. 
 FLASH CUT: INT. LIBERTY DINER - DAY 
 BRIAN 
 I made it an early evening. 
 EMMETT 
 You know, um, when I go ... promise you won't let them sew my mouth shut. Because when I get to heaven, and I meet Natalie Wood, I wanna be able to say, 'Natalie, it's Emmett. What happened that night?!' 
 They all laugh. 
 DEB [OS] 
 Hey! 
 She's standing at the table with a serious face, serving tray in hand. 
 DEB 
 Shouldn't you boys be getting to the hospital? 
 She walks away. Their smiles fade. 
 CUT TO: INT. HOSPITAL - DAY 
 Ted, in a bed and on oxygen, looks asleep. 
 MICHAEL [OS] 
 Schmidt, Ted. 
 NURSE [OS] 
 Are you family? 
 INT. NURSE'S STATION 
 Brian, Emmett and Michael stand at the desk. 
 MICHAEL 
 Friends. Uh, we know he's, like, in a coma and everything. We just would like to be with him for a little while, if that's okay. 
 NURSE 
 I'll see. 
 She walks away. 
 EMMETT 
 The nurse's station. I used to think it had something to do with radio. 'All nursing, all the time.' 
 They chuckle. 
 MRS. SCHMIDT [OS] 
 Hello. 
 We pan to the right and see a nicely dressed woman, MRS. SCHMIDT, sitting along the row of chairs against the wall. 
 MRS. SCHMIDT 
 I'm Margaret Schmidt. I'm Ted's mother. 
 They look at her. Michael walks over. 
 MRS. SCHMIDT 
 If you need permission to see him, I'll give it. I've ... I'm sure he'd appreciate it. 
 MICHAEL 
 I'm Michael. And this is Emmett [gestures] and Brian [gestures]. We're Ted's friends. 
 MRS. SCHMIDT 
 He's still in the coma. He looks like he did when he was a boy. When he slept. They don't think he'll come out of it. 
 Emmett looks back at Brian. Michael sits by Mrs. Schmidt. 
 MRS. SCHMIDT 
 I sat by his bed ... all night. About five o'clock in the morning it occurred to me ... loving someone's not the same as knowing them. 
 Brian looks away. And spots a hot MALE NURSE in the room behind the nurse's station. As the sound of orgasmic moans start in the background, Brian watches him walk by and Male Nurse smiles, interested. Michael sees the exchange. 
 MICHAEL 
 Brian! 
 Brian turns back around to see them all staring at him. He looks away, chastised. 
 CUT TO: INT. JUSTIN'S BEDROOM - DAY 
 Bedside table clock reads 8:09 a.m. Bare chested, Justin is sleeping face down under the comforter. 
 JENNIFER [OS] 
 Justin? 
 Knock on the door. 
 JENNIFER [OS] 
 Justin, you're late. 
 Justin lifts his head a little and 'hmphs' as he wakes up. Jennifer walks in. 
 JUSTIN [OS] 
 You're right. 
 Tossing the comforter, he rolls over and up. 
 JUSTIN 
 I'm up, I'm up. 
 JENNIFER 
 You got ten minutes. 
 She starts making his bed. 
 JUSTIN 
 I'm taking a shower, okay? 
 He walks off-screen. The sound of running water. Jennifer spots his open backpack on the bed. After a glance at the bathroom, she pulls out Justin's sketchpad. Another glance the bathroom's way and she opens the pad. Inside are drawings of a football player (#68 - Chris Hobbs). 
 First page: the football player a) talking to a figure b) holding a male figure in his arms. Second page: close-ups of the football player's face. Third page is blank. Fourth/fifth page: more of the football player in uniform, full body. Sixth page is men: chests, abs, asses. Seventh page is covered with Brian's name. 
 Jennifer puts the sketchpad back. She stands still, closing her eyes. Justin's voice startles her. 
 JUSTIN [OS] 
 I'm out of shampoo. 
 JENNIFER 
 I'll get you some. 
 She leaves. The clock reads 8:10 a.m. 
 CUT TO: INT. HOSPITAL - DAY 
 Emmett, Brian and Michael looking into Ted's room from the door window. Inside, Male Nurse is tending to Ted. Lifting the bed rail, he sees them and walks over to slide shut the curtain. 
 EMMETT 
 Who do you think it was? I mean, who, uh, gave him the drugs. 
 MICHAEL 
 I bet it was that guy Blake who was cruising him all night. 
 EMMETT 
 Think we should tell someone? 
 BRIAN 
 No. 
 Long beat. 
 MICHAEL 
 His mom said she'd call us if there was any change. 
 BRIAN 
 You know, he's a first. The first almost dead guy I sort of had s*x with. 
 MICHAEL 
 You had s*x with Ted? 
 EMMETT 
 You never had s*x with Ted. 
 MICHAEL 
 When did you have s*x with T-- 
 BRIAN 
 Sort of s*x. At this semi-orgy. 
 MICHAEL 
 Semi? When? 
 BRIAN 
 You know that weekend that John-John's plane went down? 
 EMMETT 
 Oh ... god. They kept showing him on the beach with his shirt off. I didn't know whether to jerk off or weep. 
 MICHAEL 
 So did-so did you, like, plan it? 
 BRIAN 
 It just sort of happened. Things do. 
 Emmett laughs. 
 BRIAN 
 It was Scott and Kevin, the Todds. 
 Emmett holds up his pinkie finger. 
 BRIAN 
 And Ted shows up with my taxes, and all the sudden we're all doing it and ... he even tried to f*ck me. 
 MICHAEL 
 He's in there. His life's like this [gestures up and down], dot on a screen. And that could be us. 
 BRIAN 
 No, it could not be us. Because we know better. We know not to believe pretty little blond boys who tell you it's 'really good sh1t.' Because that's what they all say. Ted didn't know that. And he didn't know that you only do drugs with your friends because they're the only ones who give a f*ck about you. 
 He puts a hand on each of their shoulders. 
 BRIAN 
 Now I've got to go to work. I have to be brilliant. 
 CUT TO: INT. ST. JAMES ACADEMY - DAY 
 Middle-aged teacher, MR. HORNER, stands at the blackboard where a large black and white photo of a man hangs. 
 MR. HORNER 
 F. Scott Fitzgerald. Classic profile, famously handsome.  
 He gestures with a book he's holding. 
 MR. HORNER 
 And The Great Gatsby. 
 He sits on the edge of his desk. View of the classroom and we see Justin, chin down, at his desk in the back. Chris Hobbs sits one aisle over to the right. 
 MR. HORNER [OS] 
 Which captures a particular American yearning. 
 Shot of Chris that pans down to the back of a male figure Justin is drawing in his sketchpad. 
 MR. HORNER 
 And what do I mean by that, hmm? 
 Daphne, at Justin's left and seeing the drawing, giggles. Justin grins in reaction but doesn't look up. 
 MR. HORNER 
 Justin? 
 Justin looks up, startled. The class turns to look at him. Close-up on Chris. 
 JUSTIN [OS] 
 Uh, yearning is when you want something really badly. 
 Back to Justin. 
 JUSTIN 
 Like ... so bad it hurts. 
 Chris looks from Justin back to Mr. Horner. 
 MR. HORNER 
 Exactly. It needs to hurt to be worthy of the word. 
 Back to Chris. 
 MR. HORNER [OS] 
 Otherwise, it's just wanting. 
 Justin drawing. 
 MR. HORNER [OS] 
 It's represented in The Gatsby by the green light across the water. 
 Close-up of Justin's eyes as he stares at Chris. 
 MR. HORNER [OS] 
 You can see it, but you can't touch it. 
 Chris friend-punches the arm of the guy in front of him. They trade punches. 
 MR. HORNER [OS] 
 Mr. Hobbs! 
 Tossing the book down, he walks over. 
 MR. HORNER 
 Mr. Hobbs, are your parents really paying for you to have another testosterone outburst? 
 CHRIS 
 I wasn't doing anything. 
 MR. HORNER 
 Exactly. But you will be after school. 
 CHRIS 
 I have football practice. 
 Justin is listening intently. 
 MR. HORNER 
 Not today. Today you'll be cleaning out the athletic room. The only thing we fight about in this room, Mr. Hobbs ... is interpretation. 
 CUT TO: INT. HOSPITAL - DAY 
 Michael and Emmett walk up to Mrs. Schmidt. She's sitting, reading a magazine. 
 MICHAEL 
 Mrs. Schmidt, we're going to work. I-if you want, you can call me on my cell phone if... 
 MRS. SCHMIDT 
 They said ... he took an overdose of a-a drug I've never heard of. 
 EMMETT 
 Well, h-he wasn't a-a drug user. 
 MICHAEL 
 He must have met someone that night. And-and took him home. 
 MRS. SCHMIDT 
 May I ask you something, Michael? 
 MICHAEL 
 Sure. 
 Mrs. Schmidt stands. 
 MRS. SCHMIDT 
 If my son had been ... straight, if he had taken a woman home, do you think she would have run off and left him there to die? 
 She grabs her purse and leaves. 
 CUT TO: INT. ST. JAMES ACADEMY - DAY 
 Chris is cleaning the equipment room. We pull back and see Justin standing there, watching. 
 JUSTIN 
 Need some help? 
 Chris turns. 
 CHRIS 
 This sucks. 
 JUSTIN 
 Yeah. They need you at practice. 
 He walks further in the room. 
 CHRIS 
 How do you know they do? I thought you weren't into, like, sports and sh1t. 
 JUSTIN 
 Some. 
 CHRIS 
 Yeah, well, you sure keep it a secret. I'm supposed to get all this sh1t cleaned up outta here. 
 Justin picks up a box of equipment and sets it on the table. 
 CHRIS 
 Wow, you're pretty strong. 
 JUSTIN 
 It's my other secret. 
 He grins. 
 CUT TO: INT. RYDER ADVERTISING - DAY 
 Brian at his desk, looking at some copy. He tosses it on the desk. 
 BRIAN 
 I can't do this f*cking copy. 
 MELANIE [OS] 
 Excuse me for barging in. 
 She strides in and slams her briefcase down on Brian's desk. 
 MELANIE 
 This won't take long. As you may or may not know, I'm Ted's lawyer. 
 BRIAN 
 So? 
 MELANIE 
 So, you need to know Ted made a living will. Do you have one? 
 BRIAN 
 No. 
 MELANIE 
 Well, you should. 
 She holds out some papers from a folder for him to take. 
 MELANIE 
 But, I'm not your lawyer, I'm his. 
 When Brian doesn't take the papers, she drops them on his desk. 
 MELANIE 
 Anyway, he's made you responsible. 
 BRIAN 
 For what? 
 MELANIE 
 For deciding should he ever be incompetent or unable to make a decision whether to be kept alive by extraordinary measures or ... be permitted to die. 
 BRIAN 
 Are you telling me that Ted wants me to decide whether or not to pull the plug? 
 MELANIE 
 I tried to talk him out of it. 
 BRIAN 
 And how long have you known about this? 
 MELANIE 
 It doesn't matter how long. 
 BRIAN 
 Yeah, it does. I'm this secret you two have been sharing. When were you planning on telling me? 
 MELANIE 
 I was hoping I wouldn't have to. That the situation would never arise. 
 BRIAN 
 Well, it has! It's arisen now. 
 MELANIE 
 And now you know. 
 CUT TO: INT. ST. JAMES ACADEMY - DAY 
 Equipment room. Chris is sitting on a mat. He catches the Pepsi Justin tosses at him. He pops it open and it foams out. Still standing, Justin watches. Chris takes a drink, shaking his hand of the foam. Justin is quiet. Chris offers him a drink. Their hands touch as they trade off and time slows. We see the red Babylon stamp on the back of Justin's right hand. The camera pans down, signaling a time jump, and Justin is sitting beside Chris. 
 CHRIS 
 Suzanne Shepley, big whore. She'll blow you, but she won't f*ck if you're in this school. Only if you go somewhere else, preferably Catholic. 
 JUSTIN 
 She seemed like a dyke to me. 
 CHRIS 
 Oh, man, she's not a dyke. She's a whore. There's a difference. 
 They laugh. Long pause as Chris looks at Justin's profile. 
 CHRIS 
 So you know Mary Francis Cottallutto? So, she comes over to interview me for the school paper about being this great athlete and sh1t. And it's four o'clock and my mom won't be home till six. So I tell her what a touchdown is like, and she grabs my dick. 
 JUSTIN 
 No! 
 CHRIS 
 Oh, yeah, she went for it. Not only that, she unzips my fly. 
 He slides his leg down and starts to rub himself, eyes closed. Justin swallows as he watches. 
 CHRIS 
 She's got my dick and she's got all these rings on. They're cold, but her hand's warm. She's rubbing ... and rubbing. Oh, yeah. And then she's gotta go home. You know, and I'm there. And I'm... 
 JUSTIN 
 You're hard. 
 Chris says nothing, eyes still closed. Justin reaches over and rubs Chris's cock. Then he unzips and slides his hand inside to slowly jerk him off. Chris pants and moans. Justin grins and goes faster. After Chris comes, Justin's smile fades and he pulls his hand away. In that instant, the door opens. 
 CHRIS 
 sh1t. 
 He zips his pants without Mr. Horner seeing as he walks in. 
 MR. HORNER 
 Shouldn't you be working? 
 CHRIS 
 I, uh, I am working, Mr. Horner. 
 He quickly gets up. Justin grins. 
 CUT TO: INT. WORLD GYM - DAY 
 Steam room with towel-clad men. We follow NAKED GUY to find Emmett and Michael lounging in the corner. 
 NAKED GUY #1 
 Hey, guys. 
 NAKED GUY #2 
 Hey. 
 Emmett watches Naked Guy pass. 
 EMMETT 
 How come I can't get my gluts to look like that? 
 MICHAEL 
 Maybe you're not properly visualizing the muscle group. 
 EMMETT 
 Oh, I'm visualizing it all right. On my face. 
 They laugh. Brian appears and takes the seat in front of them. 
 BRIAN 
 Why me? Why not his mother? [to Emmett] Why not you? 
 EMMETT 
 Because I can't decide what to wear in the morning. Who, in their right mind, would give me power of life and death? 
 MICHAEL 
 I couldn't do it, either. 
 BRIAN 
 I don't even like Ted. 
 MICHAEL 
 Oh, come on. You do so. 
 BRIAN 
 Well, not enough to be responsible for his f*cking life. 
 EMMETT 
 Well, he must have wanted you for a reason. 
 MICHAEL 
 Maybe he's secretly in love with you. 
 BRIAN 
 I love you. I'm comatose. Kill me. 
 MICHAEL 
 It's not over yet, Brian. He could still wake up. 
 Brian looks at him. 
 CUT TO: INT. JUSTIN'S ROOM - DAY 
 Justin (in casual clothes) and Daphne (in her school uniform) are laying on the bed with the stereo playing. 
 DAPHNE 
 Chris? 
 She laughs. 
 DAPHNE 
 No way! 
 Grinning, Justin makes a jerking off gesture. 
 JUSTIN 
 Then don't believe me. 
 DAPHNE 
 But I thought you were in love with that Brian guy. 
 JUSTIN 
 Me and Chris? That's not love, Daph. That's just f*cking. 
 She laughs. 
 DAPHNE 
 Oh, and I thought it was detention. 
 They laugh. 
 JENNIFER [OS] 
 Justin? 
 Daphne sits up. 
 DAPHNE 
 Oh, I gotta go. 
 She gets her backpack. Justin goes to the stereo. 
 DAPHNE 
 Hi, Mrs. Taylor. 
 Jennifer grins. 
 JENNIFER 
 Hi, Daphne. 
 Daphne leaves. Jennifer looks at her watch. 
 JENNIFER 
 Didn't you have art club this afternoon? 
 JUSTIN 
 I quit art club. 
 Justin stops the CD playing. 
 JENNIFER 
 You love art club. 
 JUSTIN 
 I'm not interested. 
 JENNIFER 
 Since when? Just last week-- 
 JUSTIN 
 You don't know everything about me. A week's, like, a long time. Things can change in a week. 
 JENNIFER 
 Well, I thought you might like to know I'm going to Niketown, but you're probably not interested in that, either. 
 JUSTIN 
 When? 
 JENNIFER 
 Now. And you can drive. 
 Justin follows her out. 
 CUT TO: INT. LIBERTY AVENUE DINER - DAY 
 Michael walks in and watches Deb behind the counter, clearing dishes. She rubs her nose in a cute way and Michael smiles. Deb looks up and sees him. She grins and waves, going over to him, rubbing her nose again. Michael keeps grinning at her. 
 DEB 
 What? 
 MICHAEL 
 Just the thing you do with your hand. 
 He does her nose-rub twice. 
 MICHAEL 
 Like this. 
 Deb grins. 
 DEB 
 I do that, huh? 
 MICHAEL 
 Yeah, you do. 
 DEB 
 Well, you should know. 
 MICHAEL 
 Yeah. 
 They're quiet. Deb leans over, pats his hand. 
 DEB 
 People wake up from comas, sweetheart. 
 MICHAEL 
 Yeah, sure. 
 DEB 
 Your Uncle Vic. How long was he in his? 
 MICHAEL 
 Nine days? 
 DEB 
 Ten. And I thought I'd lost him. I couldn't tell your grandmother it was AIDS at the time because she couldn't have dealt with it. I wanted to hear all about the white light and the-the tunnel and-and-and did Aunt Teresa get to heaven. First words out of his mouth: 'Did I miss the Golden Globes?' 
 She laughs, Michael smiles. She leans forward again. 
 DEB 
 So, how is he? 
 MICHAEL 
 The same. No change. [beat] I'm gonna go back a little later. I thought I'd take something to his mom. 
 Deb gets emotional and comes around the counter to grab his head and kiss him. She walks back behind the counter. 
 MICHAEL 
 What was that for? 
 Deb dismisses it with a wave and gets a Styrofoam container off a shelf, then the lemon bars. 
 DEB 
 Turkey meatloaf. Lemon bars. They're great today. 
 CUT TO: EXT. RESIDENTIAL ROAD - DAY 
 Justin driving, Jennifer in the passenger seat. 
 JENNIFER 
 You're a good driver. 
 JUSTIN 
 Better than you. 
 He laughs and after a second, so does Jennifer. She touches the dashboard. 
 JENNIFER 
 Okay, slow down. This is a bit too fast. 
 Justin looks/points to the speedometer. 
 JUSTIN 
 This is normal. And you just said I was a good driver. 
 Jennifer smiles at him. 
 JUSTIN 
 What? 
 JENNIFER 
 Nothing. It's just nice. You laughed. It's been a while. 
 JUSTIN 
 You know, maybe you could get another car. Let me have this for school. 
 JENNIFER 
 Oh, just hand it over, huh? I was twenty before I had a car. I was going out with Jay McLaughlin. He could have been your father. 
 JUSTIN 
 That's stupid. I wouldn't be me. 
 JENNIFER 
 He was my first real boyfriend. 
 JUSTIN 
 I'd be totally someone else. 
 JENNIFER 
 Learned with him what a kiss really was. 
 Justin makes a face. 
 JUSTIN 
 Gross! 
 Jennifer laughs. 
 JUSTIN 
 Don't tell me. I don't want to know. 
 JENNIFER 
 Well, now you do. 
 Justin grins. Jennifer looks at the Babylon stamp on his hand. 
 JENNIFER 
 So, do you have a boyfriend, Justin? 
 Flash-cut to a shocked Justin. Long pause. 
 JENNIFER 
 You can tell me. I promise you, I won't tell your father. 
 JUSTIN 
 I don't. 
 JENNIFER 
 Then who's Brian? 
 Justin shoots her a shocked look. He pulls over, shuts the car off and opens the door. 
 JENNIFER 
 Justin. 
 He runs away. 
 JENNIFER 
 Justin! 
 CUT TO: INT. HOSPITAL - DAY 
 Chapel. Michael walks in with the diner food. He clears his throat. 
 MICHAEL 
 Mrs. Schmidt? 
 Sitting in the front row before a cross, Mrs. Schmidt turns and smiles. 
 MRS. SCHMIDT 
 Michael. 
 MICHAEL 
 I don't mean to bug you. Uh, I brought you this. It's from my mom. I ... meatloaf and lemons bars. The lemon bars are really good. 
 He hands her the container. 
 MRS. SCHMIDT 
 There's, um, still no change. 
 Michael sits across the aisle from her. 
 MRS. SCHMIDT 
 They're watching and waiting, so ... I thought I'd take a small break. 
 MICHAEL 
 Well, I'm sure you could use one. 
 MRS. SCHMIDT 
 He mentioned a Michael. I said, um, 'Tell me the name of one special friend.' And he said, 'Well, there's a Michael.' Thank you for the food, dear. I'll, uh, stay a bit longer and then I'll go to his condo tonight. 
 MICHAEL 
 His ... condo? 
 MRS. SCHMIDT 
 Oh, for pajamas. I don't know if he even wears them, but ... if he does, he'll need them when, um... 
 She stands to go after palming Michael's cheek. Michael waits until she's walking away before pulling out his cell phone. 
 CUT TO: INT. TORSO - DAY 
 Emmett is folding clothes with a phone headset on. 
 EMMETT 
 Torso. 
 SPLIT SCREEN SHOT: 
 Emmett at Torso. 
 Michael in the chapel. 
 MICHAEL 
 It's me. 
 EMMETT 
 Oh my god, is he dead? 
 MICHAEL 
 No, but he's gonna wish he was when he finds out his mom's going to his condo tonight for pajamas. 
 Emmett laughs. 
 EMMETT 
 Oh, sh1t! What if she finds his p0rn? 
 MICHAEL 
 And his magazines. And remember his thirty-third birthday last year-- 
 Emmett laughs. 
 EMMETT 
 When we gave him those thirty-three dildos. That was hilarious. 
 MICHAEL 
 Well, it's not so funny anymore. We gotta go there and find all thirty-three. 
 EMMETT 
 Wait! 
 MICHAEL 
 What?  
 EMMETT 
 What if he's given some as hostess gifts? 
 MICHAEL 
 Wha--? 
 CUT TO: INT. LINDSAY AND MELANIE'S HOUSE - DAY 
 Lindsay, Gus in hand, goes to answer the knock on the door. It's Brian. He removes his sunglasses and comes in. 
 BRIAN 
 I don't have a lot of time. 
 He shuts the door and walks away. 
 LINDSAY 
 You have time to kiss your son. 
 She follows and hands Gus to him. Brian relaxes and kisses Gus's cheek. We hear someone coming down the stairs. 
 MELANIE [OS] 
 Hey, honey, his bath's ready. 
 She stops at the base of the stairs, seeing Brian. Brian hands Gus back to Lindsay. 
 MELANIE 
 Oh. Did we know he was coming? 
 BRIAN 
 No, we did not know. 
 MELANIE 
 Well, it'd be nice if you'd call first. As I said, his bath's ready, so if you want me to take him up-- 
 Brian swings around to face Melanie, agitated. 
 BRIAN 
 I don't give a sh1t what Ted wants. I'm not doing it, do you understand? 
 MELANIE 
 I told him you'd be this way. 
 BRIAN 
 He has a mother. 
 MELANIE 
 Yeah, would you wish this on yours? 
 BRIAN 
 He has better friends. 
 MELANIE 
 Well that's for goddamn sure! 
 Gus starts to cry. 
 LINDSAY 
 [disapproving] Melanie, would you please... 
 MELANIE 
 Look, did I barge in here at bath time? Was that me? 
 BRIAN 
 f*ck bath time and f*ck you! 
 MELANIE 
 Hey, f*ck you! 
 LINDSAY 
 Just stop it, both of you. 
 BRIAN 
 So, let's cut to the chase. Find somebody else. His mommy, or Michael or Madonna. I don't care who. 
 LINDSAY 
 But he chose you. 
 BRIAN 
 Well, he chose wrong. 
 MELANIE 
 Yeah, that's what I said to him. I said, 'Brian is not the person you want responsible for your life. He's a selfish, narcissistic little f*cking faggot!' And let me tell you something, it's not because you suck cock, it's because you're a little f*cking coward! So go, get out, now! 
 Brian stares at her, then looks to Lindsay. Her expression and a helpless shake of her head says he should just go. Brian looks at Melanie again, then goes to the door. Melanie shadows him, slamming the door once he's gone. Lindsay takes a few steps closer. 
 LINDSAY 
 You had no right talking to him that way. 
 Melanie turns. 
 MELANIE 
 No right? Ted is lying there, on life support. He's probably never going to wake up and he is depending on Brian to show him the decency, the kindness to release him. 
 Lindsay closes the distance between them. 
 LINDSAY 
 That's all the more reason to be kind. After all, he's the one who has to do it. Think how hard it must be. What if it were one of us? If it was me lying there and you had to pull the plug? 
 Melanie shakes her head, affected. 
 MELANIE 
 I'm not sure I could. 
 LINDSAY 
 Maybe that's why you're so angry at him. Because you know if it were you, you'd be as scared and angry as he is. 
 They lean their foreheads together. 
 
 
 
 CUT TO: INT. BABYLON - DAY 
 Backroom. Brian grabs Trick #1 to kiss. The trick slides down while two more tricks join in, touching and licking Brian's body. After a minute, Brian grabs the chin of Trick #2, looks at him, then pushes him away. He shoves the other tricks away and pulls his leather jacket back up onto his shoulders and walk-stumbles a few steps. Puts on his sunglasses and goes out the back door. 
 CUT TO: EXT. DAPHNE'S HOUSE - DAY 
 Justin and Daphne stand in the driveway behind a car. Justin is smoking. 
 JUSTIN 
 She knows! My mom knows! 
 DAPHNE 
 Holy sh1t! 
 JUSTIN 
 I've got to find Brian. 
 DAPHNE 
 What for? 
 JUSTIN 
 He'll know what to do. 
 DAPHNE 
 Like he cares. 
 JUSTIN 
 He wants me! 
 DAPHNE 
 How can you tell? 
 JUSTIN 
 Because I can. I'm gonna live with him. I'm gonna be with him. You'll see. Now, please, you've got to help me. 
 DAPHNE 
 I'm grounded. 
 JUSTIN 
 [soft] Oh, f*ck. 
 He takes a drag off his cigarette. 
 DAPHNE 
 My mom said she'd better come home and find me reading Toni Morrison. 
 Justin gives her puppy eyes. Daphne sighs. Beat. 
 DAPHNE 
 Well, they don't get home until seven. And you do beat Beloved. 
 Justin is grinning as he throws his cigarette down. They get in the car. 
 CUT TO: INT. TED'S APARTMENT - DAY 
 Sound of a key in a lock. Emmett and Michael walk in. Emmett slides the coffee table lamp over a few inches. 
 EMMETT 
 That's better. I'm always telling him not everything in life needs to be centered. 
 Michael is in the kitchen, frantic. 
 MICHAEL 
 We can redecorate later. His mother's coming. 
 He opens the refrigerator. 
 MICHAEL 
 Poppers. 
 He tosses the vial over his shoulder to Emmett. 
 EMMETT 
 Oop! 
 Michael tosses more packages that Emmett catches. 
 MICHAEL 
 Cheddar. Uh, Brie. 
 EMMETT 
 I don't think there are particularly strong shame issues attached to cheese, Michael. 
 MICHAEL 
 Fine! Whatever. You check out the bedroom. I'll work out here. 
 EMMETT 
 Okay.  
 Emmett goes off. Michael throws things away in the kitchen, then rushes to the front room. At the TV stand, he goes through drawers of video tapes, sorting out the p0rn. 
 MICHAEL 
 Falcon ... Falcon... You've Got Mail. He masturbates to Meg Ryan and Tom Hanks? 
 A dildo comes sailing through the air, hitting him in the head. 
 MICHAEL 
 Ow! 
 More dildos come flying. 
 EMMETT 
 Found 'em! 
 Michael catches a huge one. 
 MICHAEL 
 God! Jesus, look at this one. 
 Emmett jumps into the room, holding another huge dildo like a sword. 
 EMMETT 
 Ha! 
 They start dueling. 
 MICHAEL 
 Touché! 
 Emmett jabs at Michael's butt. 
 EMMETT 
 In this case, tushy. 
 MICHAEL 
 Whoo! 
 More dueling, then Emmett stabs Michael in the chest. Making dying noises, Michael falls on the couch, Emmett following to sit hard on his lap. 
 EMMETT 
 Dead! Right through the heart! 
 Emmett jumps up to head back to the bedroom. 
 EMMETT 
 All right. There's, like, a million of 'em in there. And we've gotta find them all. 
 Michael gets up. 
 MICHAEL 
 We must. 
 He rounds up the thrown dildos and p0rn tapes off the floor, following Emmett into the bedroom. After tossing them onto the bed, he starts going through Ted's dresser, while Emmett opens a locker. Taped to the inside of the door are about twenty pictures of Michael: candids, smiling with Ted, working at the computer, making funny faces, bare chested. 
 EMMETT 
 Michael? Come here. 
 Michael walks over. He goes solemn, seeing the pictures. They trade a look. 
 CUT TO: EXT. BRIAN'S LOFT - NIGHT 
 Justin repeatedly buzzing the loft's intercom. He tries the locked door. 
 JUSTIN 
 sh1t! f*ck! 
 He backs up into the street, screaming up at the loft. 
 JUSTIN 
 Brian! Brian! 
 MAN [OS] 
 Shut up! 
 Across the street, Daphne honks her car horn and leans out the window. 
 DAPHNE 
 Justin, I gotta go home. 
 Justin looks back at her, then up at the loft, before crossing the street. 
 JUSTIN 
 But, I-I have to find him. 
 DAPHNE 
 Well, what about the crazy lady? 
 JUSTIN 
 What crazy lady? 
 DAPHNE 
 You know, the weird one ... from the diner. 
 JUSTIN 
 You mean Debbie? 
 CUT TO: INT. WOODY'S - NIGHT 
 We pan by a guy playing pool to Michael and Emmett sitting at a table with beers. 
 MICHAEL 
 So what do you think it means? 
 EMMETT 
 I think it means he likes you. 
 MICHAEL 
 I think it means he loves me. 
 Emmett takes a drink. 
 EMMETT 
 Kind of flattering, in a way. He collects you the way you collect comics. 
 MICHAEL 
 It's just that ... all this time, I ... I never knew. 
 EMMETT 
 There's a lot of things we don't know about each other. Like, did you know ... I used to walk down the street in Hazelhurst, Mississippi, and the postman would spit at me. 
 MICHAEL 
 I don't know where my father was born. Or ... even who he is. 
 EMMETT 
 I sat with my dead grandma for an hour ... and held her hand ... before I told anyone she was dead. 
 Michael reaches for his hand. 
 EMMETT 
 How come we never tell each other these things, huh? 
 He takes Michael's hand. 
 CUT TO: INT. DEB'S HOUSE - NIGHT 
 Deb with a hand on her hip, having answered the door to find Justin. 
 DEB 
 Don't tell me. Brian. Am I right? 
 Justin nods. Deb softens. 
 DEB 
 Come on in. I'll make you a sandwich. 
 She walks away. Justin comes in, closing the door. 
 JUSTIN 
 Actually, I just need to know how I can-- 
 DEB 
 And don't talk. I can figure it all out. 
 She goes to the wall phone, motioning Justin to the kitchen table. 
 DEB 
 Have a seat, honey. Right there. 
 She punches in a number as Justin sits. 
 DEB 
 Michael? 
 Justin whips his head around. 
 DEB 
 It's me. You've got male. 
 Justin deflates. 
 CUT TO: INT. BRIAN'S LOFT - NIGHT 
 Lindsay in the loft. Brian, fresh from the shower in his robe and holding a drink, slides the door shut. He walks to the kitchen, Lindsay following. 
 LINDSAY 
 I just want you to know Melanie feels terrible about what she said. 
 BRIAN 
 Do you think I care? 
 Adds ice to his drink. 
 LINDSAY 
 Look, it's upsetting for all of us. But at a time like this we could try showing a little compassion. Especially for Ted. Is there any word? 
 BRIAN 
 The machines say he's still alive. 
 LINDSAY 
 Poor guy. 
 BRIAN 
 What about us? We don't have any beeps or wires with little white dots telling us we're alive, so how do we know? I guess we just take each other's word. 
 LINDSAY 
 Maybe we know from what people expect from us. I mean, take Gus. He needs me to feed him, to change him. Knowing that tells me I'm alive. So, for me, right now, it's him. 
 BRIAN 
 What about me? 
 Lindsay closes the distance between them. 
 LINDSAY 
 Ted needs you now. So maybe that's what tells you you're alive. 
 Brian exhales and looks down. Lindsay holds his face. 
 LINDSAY 
 You'll do the right thing. Whatever it is. 
 Her hands slide away. 
 BRIAN 
 You don't know that. 
 CUT TO: INT. TED'S HOSPITAL ROOM - NIGHT 
 Slow pan up the bed, a machine beeping. Brian's hand comes into view and hovers over Ted's face. 
 BRIAN 
 f*ck you. f*ck you. f*ck you. For going home with some tweaked out little twinkie and thinking you got lucky. 
 He leans down. 
 BRIAN 
 Did he let you eat his ass? Did he let you suck his cock? Well, I hope it was worth it. And f*ck you for choosing me. I ought to let you lie here forever. How'd you like that? Can you hear me? [long pause] You know, you're not so bad looking. In fact ... you look better like this. You should die more often. Or live. So that I don't have to say yes. Yes, I'll do it. I'll give you what you want. What you need. But don't think it's for you. It's not. It's for me. 
 A hand on his shoulder makes Brian turn. It's Male Nurse. They face each other for a second, then start kissing and stripping. Male Nurse lays on an empty bed. Brian pushes his pants to his ankles and jumps on top of him. Moans. The camera pans back to Ted's bed as he begins to wake up. 
 MALE NURSE [OS] 
 [whispered] Oh, yeah. 
 More moans and grunts. Ted moves his head, following the noise. 
 TED 
 Jesus. 
 CUT TO: INT. DEB'S HOUSE - NIGHT 
 Justin eating a sandwich. 
 MICHAEL [OS] 
 This is my house. You've got your own. Go home. 
 JUSTIN 
 [mouth full] I can't. 
 MICHAEL 
 What? 
 JUSTIN 
 [mouth full, articulating] I can't. My mom knows. 
 Shot widens and we see Vic at the kitchen table with Justin. Deb and Michael are standing. 
 DEB 
 Well, she could go to my PFLAG group at the Center every other Tuesday. I'll get her a t-shirt and a button. 
 MICHAEL 
 Ma, please! 
 DEB 
 Ma, please, what? I am proud to have a gay son. 
 MICHAEL 
 We know! 
 DEB 
 And brother. 
 She encircles Vic from behind. 
 VIC 
 Thanks, sis. 
 He takes his pills with water. 
 DEB 
 I've always said it isn't who you love, it's how you love. Genitalia is simply God's way of accessorizing. 
 MICHAEL 
 This is not about you and the Gay Mother of the Year award. This is about Brian's one night stand. 
 Justin shakes his head. 
 JUSTIN 
 [mouth full] Not just one. 
 MICHAEL 
 Don't bet on it. And who here even cares?! 
 VIC 
 I do. 
 JUSTIN 
 My dad threatened to disown me. He called me a big queer. 
 VIC 
 He didn't hit you, did he? 
 MICHAEL 
 Oh, come on, Uncle Vic. You're not gonna listen to this sh1t! 
 JUSTIN 
 That's why I have to see Brian. He'll let me stay with him. 
 MICHAEL 
 I don't think so. 
 JUSTIN 
 Well, then ... I'll go to New York! I'll become a hustler, and I'll sell my body to gross old homos! 
 Vic leans in. 
 VIC 
 I'll give you twenty bucks. 
 Deb swats his head. Vic turns to her. 
 VIC 
 Save him the train fare. 
 JUSTIN 
 I'm gonna throw up. I gotta vomit. 
 He stands, putting more sandwich in his mouth. Deb points up. 
 DEB 
 Upstairs bathroom. The one for guests and drama queens. 
 Justin jogs off. Vic and Michael laugh. 
 DEB 
 It's not a joke, you know. Gay teens have a very high suicide rate. 
 MICHAEL 
 Unfortunately not this one. 
 He enters a number into his cell phone. Deb smacks his arm; he snorts and puts the phone to his ear. 
 INT. MICHAEL'S ROOM 
 Justin walks in, looking around. He grins, seeing the corkboard with the picture of Brian and Michael as teenagers. He reaches for it. 
 INT. KITCHEN 
 Deb at the sink, Michael and Vic eating sandwiches at the table. 
 DEB 
 I'm calling his mother. 
 MICHAEL 
 It's none of our business. 
 DEB 
 He may be telling the truth, and even if he isn't, she's got to be worried. 
 VIC 
 She's not worried. Now she knows. It's not drugs. It's not booze. He didn't buy an automatic weapon to take down to the Spanish club. It's just cock. 
 Amused, Deb turns, hand on hip. Vic laughs. 
 Sound of the front door closing. 
 BRIAN [OS] 
 Hi. 
 He walks in. 
 BRIAN 
 [to Deb] How did he find you? 
 Deb throws her hands up. Brian walks over to grip Vic's shoulder in greeting. 
 MICHAEL 
 They all find her. And now he won't leave. You gotta do something. 
 BRIAN 
 Like what? 
 MICHAEL 
 Like get him out of my house! He's upstairs. 
 Brian frowns and turns. 
 BRIAN 
 All right. I'm going. 
 MICHAEL 
 This is not how I wanted to spend my evening. 
 Brian stops and grins back at them. 
 BRIAN 
 By the way ... Ted woke up. He's going to be okay. 
 Brian runs up the stairs. Everyone is relieved at the news. Deb crosses herself. 
 INT. MICHAEL'S ROOM 
 Justin looking down at the photo. He hears the door open behind him and smiles to himself before turning to face Brian. 
 BRIAN 
 What are you doing here? 
 JUSTIN 
 Waiting for you. 
 INT. KITCHEN 
 Michael, Deb, and Vic at the table. 
 DEB 
 Well, it's a relief. I'll say that. I like Ted. There's a real sweetheart in there, somewhere. 
 Michael is staring into space. 
 DEB 
 Michael? 
 INT. MICHAEL'S ROOM 
 Twice, Justin tries to go in for a kiss. Brian dodges the first time, pushes Justin's chest back the second time. When Justin stands still is when Brian finally pulls him in for a couple kisses. 
 INT. KITCHEN 
 Michael looks up at the ceiling. 
 INT. MICHAEL'S ROOM 
 One more kiss and Justin goes to his knees. Unbuttons Brian's jeans, then rises for more kisses. Brian whips Justin's shirt off. More kissing. Justin sinks downward and Brian's eyes close as Justin blows him. 
 INT. KITCHEN 
 Deb stands, taking her coffee cup to the sink. 
 DEB 
 I've decided. 
 MICHAEL 
 What? 
 DEB 
 You and me. We're taking him home. 
 MICHAEL 
 Why you and me? Wh-why me at all? 
 DEB 
 Well, he can hardly go with Brian. 
 VIC 
 And if I go it looks a little ... Fagin and Oliver Twist. 
 MICHAEL 
 Leaving me, huh? The harmless one. Thanks a lot. 
 Deb swats him with her dish towel. 
 Justin and Brian come down the stairs and into the kitchen. Justin grins smugly at Michael and steals some chips off his plate. Agitated, Michael stands and moves to the far wall behind Brian. 
 DEB 
 I'm calling your mother. I'm taking you home. 
 JUSTIN 
 I'm not going. 
 Deb points a finger in his face. 
 DEB 
 You get my tits in a knot, Sunshine, and you're gonna be in deep sh1t. 
 A hand to his chest and a grin moves him out of the way. 
 DEB 
 'Scuse me. 
 She goes to call Jennifer. Justin sits at the table, drinks some milk. 
 VIC 
 What are you studying in school? 
 JUSTIN 
 Hmm? 
 VIC 
 Called conversation. 
 Brian chuckles. He catches Michael's pissed off look and goes solemn, glancing down. Deb appears with her coat on. 
 DEB 
 Ready? 
 MICHAEL 
 I need to talk to Brian. I'll be there in a second. 
 Deb makes a 'come on' finger gesture to Justin, then turns toward the door. Justin follows. 
 JUSTIN 
 [mouths to Brian] Bye. 
 Vic gets up and leaves. Michael watches everyone leave, then faces Brian. 
 MICHAEL 
 Do you have anything to say? 
 Pause. 
 BRIAN 
 No. 
 MICHAEL 
 Well, I do. You can f*ck him at your place, you can f*ck him in his gym class, you can f*ck him at the zoo, but you cannot f*ck him in my mother's house. In my room! 
 Brian is silent. 
 DEB [OS] 
 We're waaaiting! 
 Michael looks over at the front door, then back to Brian. 
 MICHAEL 
 Okay, I'm gonna go do this little job, and then I'm going to go see Ted at the hospital. You do whatever the f*ck you want. 
 CUT TO: EXT. CITY ROAD - NIGHT 
 Michael is driving. He looks in the rear view mirror at a smugly grinning Justin. 
 DEB [OS] 
 Nobody knows if it's nature or nurture, being gay. 
 We see her in the passenger seat. 
 DEB 
 Now they're all saying you can tell by the length of the index finger. Although, all of Michael's fingers are perfectly normal. He should have three kids and a beer belly and he's about as gay as you get! 
 Justin laughs. 
 MICHAEL 
 Ma, give it a rest! 
 Deb pouts. Justin grins. 
 CUT TO: EXT. JUSTIN'S HOUSE - NIGHT 
 Deb and Michael walk up to the door. Justin lags around the corner by the garage. Deb rings the doorbell; it's melodic. She grins. 
 DEB 
 Listen! That's nice, huh? Not like that old buzzer at our house. 
 Jennifer answers the door. 
 DEB 
 Oh, hi. Um ... I was admiring your chimes. You have a ... real nice place here. 
 JENNIFER 
 Well, thank you. Uh, you-you must be-- 
 Justin barges between them and into the house. 
 DEB 
 Rude little sh1t, isn't he? 
 Jennifer stands with her hand over her heart, composing herself. 
 DEB 
 Um, I'm Debbie Novotny ... and this is my gay son, Michael. 
 MICHAEL 
 [out of the corner of his mouth] Ma! 
 Pause as Jennifer stares at Michael before shaking Deb's hand. 
 JENNIFER 
 I-I'm Jennifer Taylor. 
 Deb grins. 
 DEB 
 Jennifer. 
 CRAIG [OS] 
 Honey, who's there? 
 JENNIFER 
 [calls back] It's no one! 
 Michael and Deb look down. Jennifer comes further outside, pulling the door closer behind herself to hide them. 
 DEB 
 Uh, listen, uh ... if you ever need to talk to somebody, I work over at the Liberty Diner on Liberty Avenue. 'Cause I know what you're going through. The finding out. I mean, I always knew about Michael. In fact, I told him, right? 
 She laughs, touching Michael, who's itching his ear and giving her a 'Ma!' look. 
 DEB 
 To spare him the pain of having to tell me. So ... Jennifer ... don't ask, 'Are you?' Because it's never a question. Just say, 'I know.' 
 JENNIFER 
 Uh, thank you. 
 Jennifer gestures inside and leaves. Michael turns to Deb as the door closes. 
 MICHAEL 
 You had to say all that?! 
 DEB 
 I was trying to help. 
 MICHAEL 
 You try too much. 
 They turn and walk back down the driveway. Deb zips her coat up. 
 MICHAEL 
 You're still wearing that same old coat. 
 DEB 
 So, someday you'll buy me a mink. You're going to be a big success. 
 MICHAEL 
 Yeah, right. You'll freeze to death first. 
 Deb swats his head. 
 MICHAEL 
 What was that for?! 
 DEB 
 You can be such an asshole! 
 MICHAEL 
 What'd I do?! 
 DEB 
 You don't know yourself. 'Know thyself.' Some Greek said that. Who was it? 
 MICHAEL 
 Zorba? 
 DEB 
 I don't know. 
 She glances back at the house. 
 DEB 
 I don't know anything. Now take me home. 
 CUT TO: INT. TED'S HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY 
 Seated, Mrs. Schmidt watches Ted pack his bag. 
 MRS. SCHMIDT 
 Are you sure I can't help? 
 TED 
 I can do it. It's no big deal. 
 MRS. SCHMIDT 
 I wish you'd let me drive you home. 
 TED 
 I already asked my friends. 
 MRS. SCHMIDT 
 Michael, Emmett, Brian. 
 Ted looks up, surprised. He nods. 
 MRS. SCHMIDT 
 I met them while you were asleep. 
 TED 
 Oh. 
 MRS. SCHMIDT 
 They're very nice. Especially Michael. 
 TED 
 Yeah, Michael is ... especially special. 
 MRS. SCHMIDT 
 Are you two ... I mean... 
 TED 
 Oh, no. No. We, uh ... he's just a friend. 
 MRS. SCHMIDT 
 Well, he's a very good friend. He was very kind to me. I'm grateful you have him. 
 TED 
 Yeah, so am I. 
 MRS. SCHMIDT 
 Because, more than anything, I worry that you're alone. And that there's no one to look after you. 
 TED 
 I can take care of myself. 
 MRS. SCHMIDT 
 Oh, I know you can. You've always been self-sufficient. I just ... I wish you had someone to love you. I mean, if you did, maybe this wouldn't have happened. 
 TED 
 Mom, please. Let's, uh... 
 MRS. SCHMIDT 
 I'm sorry. I know that it embarrasses you if I talk too much or ... I get too emotional. But I can't help thinking that ... if you hadn't woken up ... then I would never have gotten the chance to let you know how proud I am that you're my son. And that .. and it doesn't matter to me what you are. Yeah, I got over that a long time ago. And that whenever you're feeling alone ... or that no one loves you ... that's not true ... because I do. 
 They're both near tears. 
 TED 
 Th-thank you ... mom, for, uh, for saying that. 
 CUT TO: INT. TED'S APARTMENT - DAY 
 Brian, Michael, Emmett and Ted walk in. Brian and Emmett are carrying paper bags of groceries and go to the kitchen. The wall clock says 11:30 a.m. 
 EMMETT 
 Now say it three times and click your heals: There's no place like home. 
 TED 
 You know, you guys really didn't have to do this. All the flowers and the groceries. 
 Brian and Emmett are unloading the bags. Michael holds his arms out. 
 MICHAEL 
 One stop shopping at the Big Q Mart. 
 TED 
 Oh, that's-that's nice. 
 He eyes the coffee table lamp Emmett moved earlier and slides it back where it began. 
 TED 
 Only, can somebody tell me why I had to stay there three days after I woke up. 
 EMMETT 
 They wanted to make sure you're still alive. 
 BRIAN 
 On your best days it's ... hard to tell. 
 Michael walks over to Ted. 
 MICHAEL 
 Okay, just so you don't freak out ... your dildos are missing. And your p0rn. We had to move it all ... in case your mom found it. 
 TED 
 Well, I expect all thirty-three back. [to Emmett and Brian] Cleaned. 
 Emmett laughs. 
 EMMETT 
 You should eat something, honey. 
 TED 
 I'm not hungry. 
 He walks toward the bedroom. 
 MICHAEL 
 We bought you a whole f*cking chicken. 
 BRIAN 
 And you're gonna eat it. 
 In his bedroom, Ted looks around. Michael follows him. 
 EMMETT [OS] 
 Oh my god, look at this. Who-who keeps lube in their-in their front kitchen cabinet? 
 Ted notices Michael. 
 TED 
 It always looks so much smaller. 
 MICHAEL 
 What does? 
 TED 
 Your life. Especially after returning from a near-death experience. 
 MICHAEL 
 Like watching the Oscars. 'Immediately proceeded by...' 
 MICHAEL AND TED 
 'The Barbara Walters Special.' 
 They chuckle. 
 TED 
 I'm glad you're here. 
 MICHAEL 
 You are? Well, uh ... I, um... 
 TED 
 What? 
 MICHAEL 
 Um ... uh ... I'm glad you're here, too. And if you ever wanna talk about this or ... other stuff... 
 TED 
 'Other stuff?' 
 MICHAEL 
 You know, there's--oh, you know, there's something you can't talk about... 
 TED 
 Like what? 
 MICHAEL 
 I don't know. You know, maybe if you talk about it, it might help it? But, you know, you might not get what you want. But ... Oh, sh1t. 
 Ted's confused. Brian pokes his head in. 
 BRIAN 
 Are you going to come eat the chicken? 
 MICHAEL 
 I'm going to arrange the daisies. 
 He leaves. Brian starts to follow when Ted speaks. 
 TED 
 I saw you. f*cking. 
 Brian frowns and comes in the room. 
 TED 
 When I woke up. I thought ... I'm in hell. And this is my punishment--watching Brian Kinney f*cking for all eternity. 
 Brian puts his arm around Ted's shoulder. 
 BRIAN 
 You should be so lucky. 
 Ted smirks. Brian slides his arm away and steps back, serious. 
 BRIAN 
 Why me? Why did you choose me? 
 He sits on the bed. Ted shrugs. 
 TED 
 My mother couldn't do it. Michael and Emmett ... couldn't do it. But ... you could. Because you're a heartless sh1t. You could pull the plug and you wouldn't cry. And you'd know when it's time to go. 
 He gently swats Brian's cheek as he walks away. Brian remains on the bed, gutted. 
 CUT TO: INT. BABYLON - NIGHT 
 Brian and Michael are dancing, having a good time. 
 BRIAN 
 I want it to be you. 
 MICHAEL 
 What? 
 BRIAN 
 I want it to be you. I'll put it in writing. 
 MICHAEL 
 I want it to be you, too. You pull my plug. 
 BRIAN 
 And you pull mine. 
 FADE TO BLACK.
