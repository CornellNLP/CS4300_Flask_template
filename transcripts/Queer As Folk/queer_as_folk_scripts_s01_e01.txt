 FADE IN: INT. BABYLON - NIGHT  
 Panning shots of the dancing crowd and go-go boys. 
 Theme: Neon 
 MICHAEL [VO] 
 The thing you need to know is, it's all about s*x. It's true. In fact, they say men think about s*x every 28 seconds. Of course, that's straight men. Gay men it's every nine. You could be at the supermarket, or the laundromat or buying a fabulous shirt when suddenly you find yourself checking out some hot guy. Hotter than the one you saw last weekend or went home with the night before, which explains why we're all at Babylon at one in the morning instead of at home, in bed. But who wants to be at home, in bed? Especially alone, when you can be here, knowing that at any moment, you might see him. The most beautiful man who ever lived. That is, until tomorrow night. 
 Pan shot from dancing go-go boys to the bar and the stud leaning against it, drinking a beer. He's in jeans, no shirt. 
 MICHAEL [VO] 
 By the way, that's me. 6'1", 46 inch chest, 16 inch biceps, 28 inch waist. A veritable god. I wish. [quick-pan down the bar to a regular guy] Okay, that's me. Michael Novotny, the semi-cute boy next door type. 29, 5'10", 140, 9 1/2 cut. All right, so I exaggerate. But, like, who's told the truth since they invented cyber-sex? 
 EMMETT 
 When did 70's night become 80's night? 
 TED 
 I remember this song from high school. Talk about feeling ancient. 
 EMMETT 
 Speak for yourself, honey. I was a mere child. 
 MICHAEL [VO] 
 And those are my two buddies. Ted and Emmett. 
 EMMETT 
 Give me those divas of disco any day. Gloria Gaynor. 
 TED 
 Donna Summer. 
 MICHAEL 
 And Miss Alicia Bridges. 
 ALL 
 [singing] I love the night life, I like to boogie, on the disco floor, ahhHHHH-- 
 Stud #1 walks by. 
 EMMETT 
 Oh my god. Have you ever seen anything more beautiful? 
 TED 
 Venice. At sunset. 
 EMMETT 
 Fine. You go down the Grand Canal, I'll go down on him. [spins] Ooo! 
 MICHAEL [VO] 
 Emmett can be a little campy. Okay, a lot campy. But you gotta admit, these days it takes real guts to be a queen in a world full of commoners. 
 TED 
 The problem with perfection is it's inability to recognize anything less perfect than itself. 
 EMMETT 
 In other words, you hit on him and he turned you down? 
 TED 
 Yeah. 
 MICHAEL [VO] 
 Ted's this really smart guy, and he's got a really big heart, only nobody here is interested in the size of that organ. 
 TED 
 Why am I wasting my time staring at a bunch of over-pumped princesses with IQs smaller than their waist-- 
 Stud #2 walks by. 
 TED 
 --Jesus, look at him. 
 MICHAEL [VO] 
 Like I said, it's all about s*x. Except when you're having it. And then it's all about [series of Michael face shots] 'Will he stay?', 'Will he go?', 'How am I doing?', 'What am I doing?' [quick-pan back out to the dance floor] Unless, of course, you're Brian Kinney. And then it's 'Who gives a f*ck what you think? You're lucky to have me.' 
 Smirking, BRIAN KINNEY leads his dance partner off the floor by the waist of his pants. They walk through the chains that separate the backroom. 
 MICHAEL: I'll get Brian. 
 CUT TO: INT. BABYLON'S BACKROOM - NIGHT 
 Wall-to-wall s*x. Michael walks in, sees TODD getting f*cked up against a wall. 
 MICHAEL 
 Hey, Todd, how's it going? 
 TODD 
 Fine. 
 Michael walks over to where Brian is leaning back against a wall, being face-nuzzled by his trick. 
 MICHAEL 
 We need to go. We want to eat. 
 Trick goes to his knees. Sound of Brian's pants being undone. 
 BRIAN 
 I'm just gonna give him my number. 
 MICHAEL 
 What'd you do? Write it on your dick? How long is this going to take? 
 BRIAN 
 [pulls Trick's mouth off his dick, looks down at him] Ten minutes ... [pushes Trick back against his crotch] ... tops. 
 Michael sighs and turns to leave. 
 CUT TO: EXT. BABYLON - NIGHT 
 The alley is crowded with night life. Ted and Emmett wait at the street corner. 
 EMMETT 
 [to passing drag queen] Mmm, Bruno. Love your outfit. [to Ted] Not everyone can wear tangerine. 
 Michael joins them. 
 TED 
 How long are we gonna wait? You know, I've got to work in the morning. 
 MICHAEL 
 Who doesn't? He said he'd be right out. 
 EMMETT 
 Yeah, we've all heard that before. 
 TED 
 This is some great system he's got. He gets to party all night and you drive him home. 
 MICHAEL 
 It's no big deal, okay? 
 EMMETT 
 [looking to Michael's right] Mmm, don't look now, but, uh, so-omebody's wa-atching. 
 Michael looks to find STALKER TRICK leaning against the wall. 
 MICHAEL 
 Oh, him. He has been cruising me all night. 
 EMMETT 
 Hmn. Playing hard to get. I love that in a man. 
 MICHAEL 
 Not playing, just not interested. 
 EMMETT 
 Check out that bubble butt. And that basket? Enough in there for the big bad wolf. 
 MICHAEL 
 Would you quit staring?! There's more to a guy than his cock size. 
 EMMETT 
 Hmn. 
 MICHAEL 
 [having turned to look] Or his perfectly shaped ass. 
 Emmett laughs. 
 TED 
 Which is why you read all those comic books, with those superheroes in their little tights - for the plot. 
 MICHAEL 
 I told you. I'm not interested. 
 TED 
 Maybe, just for once, you should be. Show a certain someone he's not the only one who can score. 
 Michael looks again. 
 CUT TO: EXT. LIBERTY AVENUE - NIGHT 
 Close-up profile of a teenage boy, JUSTIN TAYLOR. Pulling back, we see him taking everything in with inexperienced eyes. Lights a cigarette that's been tucked behind his ear and spots a MAN across the street, leaning against a lamppost. He walks over. 
 JUSTIN 
 Excuse me. Uh, could you tell me, like, where's a good place to go? 
 MAN 
 Depends what you're looking for. You want twinkies, go to BoyToy. You want leather, go to the Meathook. If you want snotty, conceited assholes who think they're better than everybody else, try Pistol. Kind of late to be out, though, isn't it? Especially on a school night? Why don't you come home with me, huh? [squeezes the back of Justin's neck] 
 JUSTIN 
 [steps back] No thanks. 
 MAN 
 Go on home to your mommy. Go on. 
 Justin walks back the way he came, taking a drag off his cigarette. 
 CUT TO: EXT. OUTSIDE BABYLON - NIGHT 
 Brian joins Michael, Ted and Emmett. He hooks an arm around Michael's shoulders and starts walking, Ted and Emmett following. 
 MICHAEL 
 That was quick. 
 TED 
 Well, when you've had as much practice as he's had... 
 BRIAN 
 I got bored. 
 EMMETT 
 I know. Getting your dick sucked can be so tedious. 
 MICHAEL 
 Well, he looked pretty hot to me. 
 BRIAN 
 Well, anybody would look hot to you. 
 Brian sees Justin walking down the street. Justin leans against a lamppost. Brian continues to stare. Their eyes meet. 
 MICHAEL [VO] 
 And that's when it happened. When he came along. 
 Brian walks over to stand chest-to-chest with Justin. 
 BRIAN 
 How's it going? You had a busy night? 
 JUSTIN 
 Just, uh, checking out the bars, you know. BoyToy, Meathook. 
 BRIAN 
 The Meathook. Really? So you're into leather? 
 JUSTIN 
 Sure. 
 BRIAN 
 Where you headed? 
 JUSTIN 
 No place special. 
 BRIAN 
 I can change that. 
 CUT TO: EXT. OUTSIDE BABYLON - NIGHT 
 Brian and Justin are sitting in the Jeep. Michael, Ted, and Emmett on the sidewalk. 
 EMMETT 
 Hey! Hey! What about us? 
 BRIAN 
 You can ride with Ted. [drives away] 
 TED 
 [waving] Thanks a lot. 
 MICHAEL 
 Asshole! 
 They walk to Ted's car, passing Stalker Trick at a food cart. 
 EMMETT 
 Well, if it isn't Miss Riding Hood and her big basket. 
 MICHAEL 
 [to Stalker Trick] Find someone else to stalk. I'm not interested. [gets in Ted's car] Go home. 
 CUT TO: INT. BRIAN'S LOFT - NIGHT 
 Brian slides open the door, throws his jacket toward the couch and goes to the kitchen. Justin remains at the door. 
 BRIAN 
 Coming in? 
 JUSTIN 
 Huh? Oh, yeah. 
 BRIAN 
 Shut the door. 
 Beat. Justin closes his eyes, takes a breath, and slides the door shut on the camera shot. He turns to see Brian take his shirt off and drink some bottled water. 
 JUSTIN 
 This is a ... really nice place. 
 Brian pours the rest of the water over his head. He shakes his head and we follow the camera down his wet chest. 
 JUSTIN 
 I like your ... kitchen. 
 BRIAN 
 Do you like Special K? [grins and takes his shoes off] 
 JUSTIN 
 It's okay. I like Cheerios better. 
 BRIAN 
 I don't mean the kind you eat with bananas. [pulls out a small pack of drugs from his pants, holds it at arm's length] My disco-pharmacologist cooks this up for me. 
 JUSTIN 
 I'm really allergic to a lot of drugs. The doctor gave me penicillin once--nearly killed me. And ... Tylenol. 
 BRIAN 
 Tylenol? [grinning] No one's allergic to Tylenol. Tylenol's what they give you when you're allergic to everything else. [unbuttons his pants in one quick motion] 
 JUSTIN 
 Oh. Well, uh ... codeine. Codeine's the worst. [sound of Brian's pants hitting the floor] Like, I get diarrhea and start vomiting uncontrollably at the same time. 
 BRIAN 
 Well, we'll make sure and keep that one on the top shelf. Out of reach. [bends over to slide his underwear off] 
 Brian stands nude, arms out to the side in offering. 
 BRIAN 
 So, are you coming or going? Or coming and then going? Or coming and staying? 
 Beat. Justin takes his jacket off to toss it aside and slowly approaches. Brian pulls him flush against his body. They tentatively begin to kiss, Brian's hand undoing Justin's pants to slip inside. The kiss turns heated. 
 CUT TO: EXT. MICHAEL AND EMMETT'S APARTMENT - NIGHT 
 Ted's car pulls to the curb. 
 EMMETT 
 Thank you for the lift. [kisses the top of Ted's head] 
 TED 
 See ya. 
 EMMETT 
 Bye. 
 Stalker Trick parks across the street and gets out as Emmett notices. 
 EMMETT 
 Oh my god. Look. He must have followed us. 
 MICHAEL 
 Christ, this is just what I need. 
 EMMETT 
 Honey, it's what we all need. Hey! When was the last time you got laid? [beat] My point exactly. If you can't remember, then it's time. Now, where are your manners? Go, uh, go invite the gentleman in while I make sure none of my fine washables are hanging in the tub. 
 Emmett walks away, leaving Michael to Stalker Trick. 
 CUT TO: INT. BRIAN'S LOFT - NIGHT 
 The bedroom. Both naked, Brian is straddling Justin, giving him a handjob. 
 BRIAN 
 Don't come yet. 
 JUSTIN 
 I'll try. Stop! [touches Brian's arm] 
 BRIAN 
 So, what do you like to do? 
 JUSTIN 
 Do? I don't know. Watch TV, play Tomb Raider. 
 BRIAN 
 I meant in bed. 
 JUSTIN 
 Oh. This is fine. 
 BRIAN 
 Are you a top or a bottom? 
 JUSTIN 
 [long pause] Top ... and bottom. 
 BRIAN 
 Oh, you're versatile, then? 
 JUSTIN 
 And ambidextrous. Which was really confusing at first cos I could never figure out which hand to throw with. 
 BRIAN 
 Do you like to rim? 
 JUSTIN 
 Sure. I love it! 
 BRIAN 
 Great. Go to it. [beat] Well? 
 JUSTIN 
 Um ... what exactly do you mean? 
 Brian grins. The phone by the bed rings. Brian picks up, resuming Justin's handjob. 
 BRIAN 
 [into phone] Yeah? What? When? Are you kidding me? No, of course you're not kidding me. When did it happen? 
 Justin taps his arm in warning he's about to come. 
 BRIAN 
 [into phone] Why didn't you call me? Well, of course I was out! I can't believe it. 
 Justin comes with a yell. 
 BRIAN 
 sh1t! Jesus Christ, I told you not to. 
 JUSTIN 
 I tried! I'm sorry. I tried! 
 BRIAN 
 All over my new duvet. 
 JUSTIN 
 I tried. 
 BRIAN 
 [wiping at himself and the bed] Thank you very much. 
 JUSTIN 
 It'll wash out, won't it? I mean, you should see my sheets at home. 
 BRIAN 
 [into phone] Just some kid. [to Justin] What's your name again? 
 JUSTIN 
 Justin. 
 BRIAN 
 [into phone] Justin. I'll be right there. [gets up] 
 CUT TO: INT. MICHAEL AND EMMETT'S APARTMENT - NIGHT 
 Michael and Stalker Trick are kissing. Emmett comes out of the kitchen with a plate.] 
 EMMETT 
 Ooh, don't mind me. Just, uh, can't sleep without my milk and Oreos. [exits] 
 MICHAEL 
 This is my friend Emmett. He's staying with me temporarily since the hooker who lived down the hall from him burned his apartment building down two years ago. 
 STALKER TRICK 
 Two years is a long time to be temporary. [resumes kissing] 
 MICHAEL 
 And yet it hasn't interfered with my love life which ... suppose says a lot about my love life. 
 STALKER TRICK 
 Do you mind if we skip the backstory and cut to the chase? It's almost two in the morning. [they resume kissing] You have a great ass. 
 MICHAEL 
 Oh, yeah? [reaches into trick's pants] So do you. It's really ... [pulls out a plastic butt form] firm. 
 STALKER TRICK 
 It's called The Butt. I got it in a catalog. 
 Phone rings. Michael lifts up a hold-that-thought finger and goes to pick up, still carrying the fake butt. 
 MICHAEL 
 [into phone] Parts department. 
 BRIAN 
 Melanie called. It's happened. 
 MICHAEL 
 [into phone] What? Oh my god, when? 
 BRIAN 
 I don't know. I had my damn cell phone off. I'm picking you up in two minutes. 
 Stalker Trick unzips pants and reaches inside. 
 MICHAEL 
 [into phone] Now? I ... kinda got my hands full. 
 STALKER TRICK 
 [holds up a plastic cock form] The Bulge. You order both, you get a discount. 
 BRIAN 
 Who's that? 
 MICHAEL 
 [into phone] Uh, no one. 
 BRIAN 
 Mikey, you've got someone there with you. I can't believe it. 
 MICHAEL 
 [into phone] You should only be here. 
 BRIAN 
 Forget about it. Don't let me bother you. f*ck the sh1t out of him. 
 MICHAEL 
 [into phone] No, wait! Pick me up. I'm-I'm ready. Now! [hangs up] 
 STALKER TRICK 
 Are we gonna do this or not? 
 MICHAEL 
 I am really, really sorry. Um, a friend of mine needs me. It's an emergency. 
 STALKER TRICK 
 sh1t! After all that? 
 MICHAEL 
 I know. I promise we'll reschedule, though. No ifs, ands, or ... [hands back the plastic butt] 
 CUT TO: INT. BRIAN'S LOFT - NIGHT 
 Brian, in pants but no shirt, runs across the loft holding his shoes. He throws Justin's clothes at him. Justin, sitting on the bed, starts to redress. 
 JUSTIN 
 What's going on? 
 BRIAN 
 Everything. Come on. Get up. You gotta go. 
 JUSTIN 
 Where? 
 BRIAN 
 Home. 
 JUSTIN 
 I can't go home now. My-my parents think I'm staying at a friends. 
 BRIAN 
 You live with your parents? 
 JUSTIN 
 Well, I'm still in school. I mean--college. 
 BRIAN 
 What year are you in? 
 JUSTIN 
 Junior. Sophomore. Between my junior and sophomore year. 
 BRIAN 
 How old are you? 
 JUSTIN 
 Twenty-one. 
 BRIAN 
 What year were you born? 
 JUSTIN 
 [beat] 1979. 
 BRIAN 
 Bullshit. You had to think before you answered that. How old are you really? 
 JUSTIN 
 Twenty. [beat] Nineteen. [beat] Eight ... teen. 
 BRIAN 
 Well, what is this, a missile launch? 
 JUSTIN 
 Seventeen. 
 BRIAN 
 What is with kids today? [sits beside Justin to pull his shoes on] 
 JUSTIN 
 We just wanna get laid like everybody else. 
 BRIAN 
 Have you ever been with anyone before? 
 JUSTIN 
 Sure. Well ... not exactly. This is sort of my first. 
 BRIAN 
 I figured. Kind of young, aren't you? Well, I was fourteen my first time. 
 JUSTIN 
 That's really young. 
 BRIAN 
 With my gym teacher. 
 JUSTIN 
 I bet he was some old perv. 
 BRIAN 
 That old perv was probably the same age that I am now. It was after school in the locker rooms. He was taking a shower. I went back for something: a book, my jockstrap, I don't remember. Anyway, there he was, all naked, soaping himself. He saw me there, a big boner under my chinos. sh1t, I walked right into the showers with all my clothes on. 
 JUSTIN 
 No! 
 BRIAN 
 Got down on my knees and sucked him off right there. 
 JUSTIN 
 He let you? 
 BRIAN 
 Let me? He loved it. 
 JUSTIN 
 I bet you were scared. 
 BRIAN 
 Well, I guess we're all a little scared our first time. [Beat. He stands.] But I don't remember any more. 
 CUT TO: EXT. MICHAEL AND EMMETT'S APARTMENT - NIGHT 
 Michael's waiting at the curb when Brian pulls up. He sees Justin in the front seat. 
 MICHAEL 
 You brought him? 
 BRIAN 
 He's got nowhere to go. Get in! 
 MICHAEL 
 Geez. 
 CUT TO: INT. HOSPITAL - NIGHT 
 Brian, Justin and Michael run down corridors until they burst into room #3. The room is crowded with women leaning over a bed. Michael walks in, grinning. Brian stands frozen in the doorway, Justin behind him. The crowd parts and we see LINDSAY PETERSON in bed, holding an infant. MELANIE MARCUS lies by her side atop the covers. 
 BRIAN 
 Oh my god. 
 LINDSAY 
 Say hello to your son. 
 MICHAEL 
 Well, go on. 
 BRIAN 
 [walks over] When did it start? 
 MELANIE 
 Around seven. 
 LINDSAY 
 Six hours later, there he was. 
 BRIAN 
 I wish I could have been here. How often do I get to see snatch? 
 LINDSAY 
 Looks just like you. 
 BRIAN 
 I guess he must be mine, then. 
 LINDSAY 
 Want to hold him? 
 Brian picks the baby up. 
 MELANIE 
 Okay, careful. Don't drop him! 
 BRIAN 
 And that's just want I was planning on doing. 
 LINDSAY 
 We've been thinking of names. Mel wants to call him Abraham after her grandfather, but ... I like Gus. 
 BRIAN 
 [looks at Justin] What do you think? 
 JUSTIN 
 Y-you wouldn't survive a day at school being named Abraham. But I guess Gus is okay. 
 MELANIE 
 Thank you very much, and who the hell are you? 
 BRIAN 
 His name's J... [long beat] 
 MICHAEL 
 Justin. 
 BRIAN 
 You were on the phone when he shot his load all over me. 
 Everyone groans. Justin winces. 
 LINDSAY 
 [laughing] Oooh, Brian! 
 BRIAN 
 He can't help it. He's only seventeen. 
 MELANIE 
 So, you and Lindsay each had an infant tonight. 
 BRIAN 
 [to Gus] But mine doesn't suck on my tits. [to Justin] Not unless I want him to. [grins at Justin, then back to Gus] Gus. It's a good butch name. Come on, Gus. Give your daddy a smile. 
 Michael takes a flash photo. Brian looks over, smiling. 
 CUT TO: EXT. HOSPITAL - NIGHT 
 The roof. Brian leans against the ledge, smoking. Michael joins him. 
 MICHAEL 
 It's disgusting, all those lesbians fawning over him and making goo-goo talk. 
 BRIAN 
 That's what women do over babies. 
 MICHAEL 
 Who's talking about the baby? I mean Justin. [beat] It's kind of weird you having a kid. Still, it's exciting, isn't it? 
 BRIAN 
 What, having some wrinkled little time clock ticking away? Reminding you that you're getting older by the minute. By the second. 
 MICHAEL 
 Keep thinking like that, you're gonna end up prematurely gra-ay. Ooh, I think I see one. [plucks a hair] 
 BRIAN 
 Ow! [shoves Michael, who laughs] Why didn't somebody try and stop me? 
 MICHAEL 
 Hello! Somebody did. But you wouldn't listen. You had to let Lindsay fill your head with all her bullshit flattery. 'Oh, Brian, you're so good-looking.' 'Oh, oh Brian, y-y-you're so smart.' 'Oh-oh, you've got such great genes, Brian. And I don't mean your 501s.' And now you're stuck with a kid. For life. 
 BRIAN 
 There is always one solution. [steps up on the ledge] I could end it all right now. 
 MICHAEL 
 Oh, that'd be dramatic. Just like E.R.--birth and death in the same episode. Now, get down! 
 BRIAN 
 No, you'll have to come get me. 
 MICHAEL 
 I'm serious. Stop clowning. 
 BRIAN 
 [shouts] Or I'll jump! 
 Brian offers his hand to join him. Michael takes it. Brian holds him to his chest. 
 BRIAN 
 Come on, Mikey. Let's fly. Like in all those comic books. [beat] I'm Superman. I'll show you the world! 
 MICHAEL 
 Why am I always Lois Lane? 
 Both grin. Michael carefully turns around and hugs Brian. 
 MICHAEL 
 Congratulations ... dad. [kisses Brian's mouth, then hugs him again] 
 
 
 
 CUT TO: INT. HOSPITAL - NIGHT 
 Brian and Michael turn the corner. Brian purposely bumps into a male doctor. 
 BRIAN 
 Sorry. [walks backwards to stare] 
 MICHAEL 
 Honestly. 
 BRIAN 
 f*cked him. 
 MICHAEL 
 You did not. You looked at him. 
 BRIAN 
 That may appear to be what happened, but we did it all. 
 MICHAEL 
 Oh, yeah, and how was he? 
 BRIAN 
 Ffffabulous. Want one? [holds up an E tablet] 
 MICHAEL 
 No. 
 BRIAN 
 More for me. [pops the tablet into his mouth] 
 MICHAEL 
 Listen, you're gonna go say goodnight to Lindsay, you're gonna go home, go to bed and get up and go to work for the next twenty years to support your kid. 
 They round another corner to see a WOMAN talking to Justin, his palm in her hand. 
 WOMAN 
 [to Justin] You see this line, how deep it is? That means you're very creative. 
 JUSTIN 
 That's true. I wanna be a cartoonist or a computer animator. 
 BRIAN 
 [grabs Justin's ear as he passes] It's far too lesbionic out here for a young boy. Out. [to Michael] I'll meet you out front. 
 Brian grabs a wheelchair. 
 CUT TO: INT. LINDSAY'S HOSPITAL ROOM - NIGHT 
 Lindsay and Melanie are on the bed. The NURSE stands at the side, holding Gus. Brian, sitting in the wheelchair, rolls inside. 
 Nurse 
 I'm sorry, sir. You'll have to come back tomorrow. The mother needs her rest. 
 BRIAN 
 And so does the father. 
 LINDSAY 
 It's okay, nurse. 
 Nurse moves to leave. Brian stands up. 
 BRIAN 
 [to Gus] Sweet dreams, Sonny Boy. First night on earth. 
 LINDSAY 
 [to Melanie] Hon, could you get me some ice and maybe something fizzy? 
 MELANIE 
 How about some Ginger Ale? Hmm. [kisses her hand and gets up] 
 Brian walks to the bed. 
 MELANIE 
 Uh, anything for you? 
 BRIAN 
 Uh, if you see any amyl nitrate laying around... 
 Mel exits, closing the door. Brian jumps onto the bed. 
 BRIAN 
 Alone at last. 
 LINDSAY 
 Careful. 
 BRIAN 
 [hand on her belly] Well, here we are. Ma and Pa. 
 Lindsay starts to cry. 
 BRIAN 
 Hey. [wipes her tears] 
 LINDSAY 
 Don't mind me. Just feeling a little ... vulnerable. 
 BRIAN 
 I promise not to tell. 
 LINDSAY 
 Who would have thought? You and me. Parents. 
 BRIAN 
 It's pretty scary, boys and girls. Think it's too late to return it? 
 LINDSAY 
 We could try. Ohh. I guess this means we're finally grown-ups. 
 BRIAN 
 'Don't say that, Wendy! We'll never grow up.' 
 LINDSAY 
 Don't be scared. Hell, if our parents could f*ck up, so can we. 
 BRIAN 
 [long beat] I don't want you to worry. About money, I mean. If you need anything... 
 LINDSAY 
 No. We'll be all right. But thanks. [kisses his cheek] 
 BRIAN 
 I would have f*cked you, you know. [both laugh] If I wasn't afraid your lover'd beat the sh1t out of me. 
 LINDSAY 
 Sto-op. 
 BRIAN 
 I mean it. She could take out Oscar de la Renta. 
 LINDSAY 
 You mean La Hoya. [softly punches his chin]  
 BRIAN 
 Whatever. 
 They laugh. 
 LINDSAY 
 Well, you had plenty of chances. 
 BRIAN 
 And I took advantage of a few, if I recall. 
 LINDSAY 
 Wasn't half bad. 
 BRIAN 
 Now you tell me? You mean I could have been straight this whole time? 
 LINDSAY 
 I wouldn't say that. 
 BRIAN 
 Well, then, I guess it's just as well. 
 He kisses her as Melanie returns with a pitcher of ice and a soda can. 
 MELANIE 
 [tense] Ice? 
 CUT TO: EXT. BRIAN'S JEEP - NIGHT 
 Michael is driving. Brian and Justin in the backseat. Brian is high. 
 BRIAN 
 Tick-tick-tick. Tick. Tick. Tick. Tick. 
 JUSTIN 
 What are you doing? 
 BRIAN 
 I'm just repeating the first words my Sonny Boy said to me. It wasn't 'da-da.' It was 'tick, tick-tick-tick.' Smart little fucker. He can tell time already. 
 Michael adjusts the rearview mirror so he can see them. 
 MICHAEL 
 Brian, what did you take? 
 BRIAN 
 A-B-C-D-E-E-E. I'm just teaching my kid the alphabet. [to Justin] I'm gonna f*ck you. I'm gonna f*ck you all ... night. 
 Brian undoes Justin's pants and goes down on him. Michael swerves the Jeep hard. 
 BRIAN 
 sh1t! 
 MICHAEL 
 So-rry. I didn't want to hit that doggie. 
 BRIAN 
 f*ck the doggie. 
 MICHAEL 
 [to Justin] Okay, Boy Wonder. I'm taking you home, where do I turn? 
 BRIAN 
 He's going with me. 
 MICHAEL 
 Ooh, no, he's not. 
 BRIAN 
 Pop quiz. No talking. Here's your question. Multiple choice. Do you want to come home with me? A:Yes, B:Yes or C:Yes. Tick-tick-tick. Time's up, pencils down. What do you say? 
 MICHAEL 
 None of the above. He's going home. 
 JUSTIN 
 I'm going with him. 
 BRIAN 
 Good boy. You get an A+. [kisses him] 
 CUT TO: INT. BRIAN'S LOFT - NIGHT 
 The bedroom. Justin on his belly as Brian slides his tongue along his back to his ass. Justin gasps loudly. Brian's head pops up.] 
 BRIAN 
 Now you know what rimming is. 
 CUT TO: INT. MICHAEL AND EMMETT'S APARTMENT - NIGHT 
 Michael is pacing. Emmett is curled up on the couch. 
 MICHAEL 
 He calls me, practically begs me to go with him, knowing full well I'm with someone for the first time in I don't know how long. 
 EMMETT 
 Seven months, two weeks and three days. 
 MICHAEL 
 Thank you. And, even though the guy wasn't all he was cracked up to be-- 
 EMMETT 
 We'll let that remark pass. 
 MICHAEL 
 At least he wanted me. Me. [sits next to Emmett] God, I am so horny! 
 EMMETT 
 Poor baby. [gets up] Well, I have just the thing. A new p0rn video. It all takes place in a Prisoner or War camp. [reads video] 'Hot, horny men starved for action.' 
 MICHAEL 
 I can relate to that. 
 EMMETT 
 Guaranteed to make your privates stand up and salute. 
 MICHAEL 
 'Schindler's Fist.' 
 EMMETT 
 [puts tape in the VCR] Ahh. Here. [hands over remote] I will leave you two alone. I'm sure you're going to have a deep meaningful relationship. Good night. [exits] 
 Michael plays the tape. 
 SERGEANT [OS] 
 Okay, private. Drop trou and bend over. 
 PRIVATE [OS] 
 For my physical, sir? 
 SERGEANT [OS] 
 No. Target practice. 
 Michael rolls his eyes. 
 PRIVATE 
 Yes, sir! 
 Michael lifts the remote to stop the tape. 
 CUT TO: INT. BRIAN'S LOFT - NIGHT 
 The bedroom. Justin on his back, Brian between his legs. 
 BRIAN 
 Put your legs up--on my shoulders. That's it. [he presses forward] 
 JUSTIN 
 Oh, wait. In school we have this lecture--about safe s*x. 
 BRIAN 
 And now we're going to have a demonstration. [opens a condom with his teeth] Put it on me. Go on. Slip it on my dick. 
 Justin does and Brian reaches for/applies the lube. Justin gasps. 
 JUSTIN 
 Ah! It's cold. 
 BRIAN 
 It'll heat up. 
 JUSTIN 
 Just ... go slow, okay? [cries out when Brian enters him] It hurts. Does it always hurt? 
 BRIAN 
 A little bit. But that's a part of it. Now relax. I want you to always remember this ... [starts slowly thrusting] so that no matter who you're ever with ... I'll always be there. 
 CUT TO: INT. BRIAN'S LOFT - DAY 
 The bedroom. The alarm chirping wakes Brian. He rolls over onto Justin to shut it off, then flops back down, eyes closed. Justin edges closer, arm on Brian's chest. Still groggy, Brian rolls over into Justin's arms. Justin's content. Suddenly, Brian's head pops up.  
 BRIAN 
 What the f*ck are you doing here? 
 JUSTIN 
 You said I could stay. 
 BRIAN 
 Right. Your parents. They think you're at a friend's. [lifts up to see his loft is trashed] Jesus Christ, what the hell happened? 
 Justin laughs. 
 BRIAN 
 Don't tell me. I was doing handstands. 
 JUSTIN 
 And juggling. You're not very good. 
 BRIAN 
 sh1t. Why do I do these things? I'll tell you why. It was that f*cking pig, Anita. She told me that was E. That wasn't E. That was some sh1t they cooked up in a bathtub in Tijuana. 
 JUSTIN 
 That's why you should never take drugs that aren't prescribed by a physician or recommended by a reliable pharmacist. 
 BRIAN 
 [laughs] What are you, a public service announcement? Get dressed. I'll drive you home. 
 JUSTIN 
 You can't. Michael has the car. 
 BRIAN 
 Why has he got it? 
 JUSTIN 
 Because you were too high to-- 
 BRIAN 
 [holds a finger up] I know what happened. I was there. I remember everything ... perfectly. What was your name again? 
 JUSTIN 
 Justin. [looks away] 
 BRIAN 
 Yeah, right. 
 JUSTIN 
 Can I take a shower? 
 BRIAN 
 Yeah. But hurry up. It's through there ... [Justin rises] I think. 
 Brian gets up naked and goes to his desk to play the answering machine. 
 MELANIE 
 [on tape] Where the hell are you? I've been trying your cell. It's turned off. If you're there, pick up. Brian. Listen, Lindsay's water broke. She's having contractions. We're at the hospital. 
 Quick-pan to Brian as he stands bolt-upright. 
 BRIAN 
 f*ck! I have a baby. 
 Sounds of the shower and Justin humming, then yelping. 
 JUSTIN 
 Ow! Ow! 
 BRIAN 
 Two babies. 
 CUT TO: INT. MICHAEL AND EMMETT'S APARTMENT - DAY 
 Michael asleep on the couch. A car alarm wakes him and he hurries to the window. We see TWO BOYS vandalizing Brian's Jeep with a crowbar and spray paint. 
 MICHAEL 
 Holy sh1t! 
 CUT TO: EXT. MICHAEL AND EMMETT'S APARTMENT - DAY 
 Michael runs for the Jeep. 
 MICHAEL 
 You little bastards! Get the f*ck away from there! 
 Boys run. 
 BOY #1 
 Faggot! 
 BOY #2 
 Queer! 
 Michael chases after. 
 BOY #1 
 Faggot! 
 MICHAEL 
 Who you calling a faggot?! 
 BOY #2 
 We've seen you! [throws spray paint at him] 
 BOY #1 
 Queer! 
 The boys disappear around the corner. Michael walks back to the Jeep and gasps. Emmett joins him. 
 EMMETT 
 Morning. [sees the Jeep and covers his mouth as he laughs] Oh, my lord. 
 MICHAEL 
 M*therf*ckers! I'm calling the cops. 
 EMMETT 
 Brian is gonna have a fit. You know how he feels about his Jeep. 
 MICHAEL 
 Well, if he cared so much about it, then he shouldn't have lent it to me. He knows what a terrible neighborhood this is 
 EMMETT 
 Well, uh, I was gonna ask for a lift to work, but on second thought, I think I'll walk. [waves] Have a nice day. 
 MICHAEL 
 sh1t! [kicks the Jeep, then crouches down--the headlight finishes falling out] 
 CUT TO: INT. BRIAN'S LOFT - DAY 
 Brian, holding his head, walks into the bathroom. He halts when he sees Justin, naked and steamy under the water. His hands drop and he joins him. 
 BRIAN 
 Why didn't you tell me I had a kid? 
 JUSTIN 
 You said you remembered everything. 
 BRIAN 
 It all happened so fast. What's his name again? 
 JUSTIN 
 Gus. I'm the one who decided. 
 Brian chuckles and grabs the soap. He lathers Justin's back. 
 JUSTIN 
 Did you actually f*ck her? 
 BRIAN 
 Who? 
 JUSTIN 
 Lindsay. 
 BRIAN 
 You're awfully rude. 
 JUSTIN 
 Well, did you? 
 BRIAN 
 I jerked off in a cup, and they squirted it up her. 
 JUSTIN 
 Gross. She must have really wanted a kid. 
 BRIAN 
 Most women do. 
 JUSTIN 
 Even lesbians? 
 BRIAN 
 Lesbians are women ... sort of. 
 JUSTIN 
 My mom says sometimes she wished she never had me. 
 BRIAN 
 That's probably because she's stuck with this annoying brat for the rest of her life. 
 JUSTIN 
 [turns to face Brian] So, you gonna raise him? 
 BRIAN 
 [laughs as he soaps Justin's chest] Me? No. Way. The Munchers are. But I'll be around to provide the masculine influence so important in every young boys' life. 
 JUSTIN 
 I'll bet Melanie could do it better than you. 
 BRIAN 
 [smacks Justin's ass] Don't get smart, or I'll have to spank you. 
 JUSTIN 
 Really? 
 They kiss. Breaking apart, they look down between them, then back up. 
 BRIAN 
 You up for one more? [pushes Justin's front against the shower wall, kissing him] 
 CUT TO: EXT. BRIAN'S LOFT - DAY 
 Michael pulls up in the Jeep. 
 MICHAEL 
 [shouts] Bri-an! 
 CUT TO: INT. BRIAN'S LOFT - DAY 
 Michael slides the door open and gapes at the mess. Walks into the bedroom where Brian and Justin are standing chest-to-chest. Brian, wearing only pants, is kissing on Justin's neck as he pulls up Justin's underwear. 
 MICHAEL 
 Christ, didn't you get enough last night? 
 BRIAN 
 [coming down the stairs] There is no such thing as enough. [puts arm around Michael] Besides ... I couldn't send him off without a nourishing high protein breakfast. [into Michael's ear] It's grrrrrr-eat! 
 Michael laughs, then walks back to Justin, still in the bedroom. 
 MICHAEL 
 Will you come on! I'm not gonna be late because of you. [walks away] 
 Justin picks up Brian's underwear. Michael reappears. 
 MICHAEL 
 I said hurry up! [walks away again] 
 Justin shoves the underwear into his right pocket. 
 CUT TO: EXT. BRIAN'S LOFT - DAY 
 Brian, Justin and Michael emerge from the building. 
 JUSTIN 
 Yeah, what'd she say? 
 BRIAN 
 She said 'Don't be late.' 
 Michael leans his head against the Jeep. A beat later, Brian and Justin see the damage. 
 BRIAN 
 Oh, that's beautiful, Mikey. 
 Michael tosses him the keys. 
 BRIAN 
 Just beautiful. 
 MICHAEL 
 It's not my fault. I told you about those two psychopaths down the street. 
 BRIAN 
 What, a couple of twelve year olds? 
 MICHAEL 
 They start early these days. 
 Justin laughs. 
 MICHAEL 
 What are you laughing at? 
 JUSTIN 
 Nothing. You. You sound like my parents fighting. 
 Long beat. 
 BRIAN 
 It doesn't matter anyway. [crosses to the driver side] It's a company car. [to Michael] Well, come on. We have to take the child to school. 
 MICHAEL 
 In this? 
 BRIAN 
 [to Justin] You care? 
 JUSTIN 
 [beat] f*ck no. 
 CUT TO: EXT. ST. JAMES SCHOOL - DAY  
 Brian driving recklessly around the corner to the entrance, horn blaring to scatter the teens in the road. When he suddenly throws on the brakes and spins toward the camera, you see FAGGOT in bright pink along the passenger side. There's laughter. 
 GIRL [OS] 
 No way. Who is that? 
 On the school steps, DAPHNE CHANDERS watches. In the Jeep, Justin slides down out of sight, embarrassed. 
 BRIAN 
 Here we are, Sonny Boy. 
 MICHAEL 
 [motherly voice] You be sure to come home right after school. 
 BRIAN 
 No lingering on the playground or in the locker room with the gym teacher. 
 MICHAEL 
 Oh, you did not tell him about that! 
 BRIAN 
 It's the most famous shower scene since 'Psycho.' 
 BOY 
 Hey, Justin! [walking by, hand at his crotch] You wanna suck me off? 
 The kids around him laugh. Brian gets out of the Jeep. 
 BRIAN 
 [shouts] No, but I'll kick your tight little virgin ass so hard you won't sit down for a week! 
 Boy runs away. Justin sits up with a grin, then jumps out. He stands in front of Brian. 
 MICHAEL 
 [wincing] Can we get out of here? 
 JUSTIN 
 When can I see you again? 
 BRIAN 
 You can see me right now. 
 JUSTIN 
 I mean later. Tonight. 
 BRIAN 
 [laughs] Who knows where I'll be later to-night. 
 MICHAEL 
 [to Justin] You better go. 
 Brian gets back in the Jeep. 
 JUSTIN 
 Please? 
 BRIAN 
 [long beat] I'll see you in your dreams. [drives away] 
 A bell rings. Justin walks up the front steps to where Daphne is waiting. She hands him his backpack. 
 DAPHNE 
 Where have you been? Your mom called. I didn't know what to tell her. I said you were still asleep. 
 JUSTIN 
 I just saw the face of God. 
 DAPHNE [OS] 
 Huh? 
 JUSTIN 
 His name is Brian Kinney. 
 CUT TO: EXT. CITY ROAD - DAY  
 The Jeep drives by with its pink FAGGOT. 
 MICHAEL 
 Thank God he's finally gone. 
 BRIAN 
 He almost wore me out. 
 MICHAEL 
 Somebody wore you out? 
 BRIAN 
 I said 'almost.' I'll drop you by the store. 
 MICHAEL 
 [laughs] The hell you will. You better get this thing repainted before you go into the office. 
 BRIAN 
 I'm not having it repainted. 
 MICHAEL 
 What? 
 BRIAN 
 I like it this way. 
 MICHAEL 
 Are you crazy? 
 Horns are honking, people hostile and staring at the Jeep as they go by. 
 BRIAN 
 No. They are. Well, I say 'f*ck 'em.' They can write it in neon across the sky. [shouts] FAGGOT! 
 They laugh as the Jeep drives by, Brian honking. Michael flings his arms up like a roller coaster ride. 
 FADE TO BLACK.
