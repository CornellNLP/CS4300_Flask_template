[applause] To stand in front ofyour family and friends, to declare your love andcommitment in the eyes of God is a privilege -- not to betaken lightly. I know, because I've shared a commitmentwith my partner for six wonderful years, even thoughwe're not married. And that's because we're not allowedto be. But that shouldn't stop two people from doing whatthey truly want. Should it? So, I'd like to ask mybeloved, "Will you marry me?"

 Brian: What for?  
 Justin: Considering I was in a coma for two weeks andrehab for a month, trying to learn that f*cking what for.  
 Brian: You know, if you really want to regain the agilityand strength in your hand, I suggest jerking off severaltimes a day. It works like magic.  
 Jutin: You've should at least called to see if I'm stillalive.  
 Brian: I'm sure I would have heard if you weren't.Besides I'm not you're occupational therpist, not traumaspecial, not even you're goddam mother so there's nothingthat I could have done to you.  
 Justin: I still don't remember to anything. Last thing Ido remember is you telling me that you wouldn't come tomy prom. But they say that you did show up after all. Andthat we danced together. And that was amazing. Daphnesaid that we were amazing.

 Mel: Oh, ...  
 Lindsay: You still haven't answered my question. Will youmerry me?  
 Mel: You aren't serious?  
 Lindsay: I was dead serious. Why do they get to receiveeveryone's blessings and presents and we don't?  
 Mel: I knew it had about the presents. Look, you can'tget married. For one thing, it's not even legal, and foranother, you know how I feel about weddings. They'remeaningless, ...

 Ted: You mean Lindsay's sister break their own record?What's about you, Michael? How was you're night on thetown?  
 Emmett: He brought home a nice centerpiece of his own.  
 Michael: Jesus, Em!  
 Ted: Well. You certainly didn't waste any time, did you?In town less than twenty-four hours.  
 Emmett: Why shouldn't he get a little action? He'soutside the four-hundred-mile limit for extramaritalquickies and anonymous assignations. Mind you, if youwant to do anything further, you'll have to do overseastravel and a fourteen-minimum day stay...  
 Ted: I just thought, with everything you wrote, you know.That you and David were so in love. So committed.  
 Emmett: Every relationship has its own set of rules.Their arrangement is none of our business. Right,sweetie? I want some pot sticker.  
 Michael: We broke up.  
 Ted: What?  
 Michael: It's over. David and I are over.  
 Emmett: Mmmh, these are the best dumplings I've ever had.  
 Ted: Did you hear what he just said?  
 Emmett: He broke up. You're broke up. So why the f*ck youdidn't tell us?  
 Michael: I was going to.  
 Ted: When? After you convince us that you found paradiselost?  
 Michael: When the time was right. You're know but there'snever a right time to admit that you failed. That you hadthis great opportunity to start your life over withsomeone that you loved, or thought you loved, and youblew it. I blew it. I complained that David was workingtoo much, and that I couldn't find a job, and that Ididn't have any friends. And when I accused him of beingthoughtless and not caring, and said that if I knew itwas going to be like this, I never would have come, hesaid, 'Well, go home, Michael!' Go home.  
 Ted: Well, I wouldn't say that you failed.  
 Emmett: And it's not true that you that you don't haveany friends. 'Cause you still got us.  
 Ted: That is for coming home, there is no shame in that.That's what it's here for.  
 [They hug each other.]  
 [The Sentencing Hearing of ChrisHobbes. Mike, Debbie, Melanie, Lindsay, and Vic sit inthe front row.]  
 Judge: The fact that Christopher Hobbes pled guilty onassault charges for his vicious attack on Justin Taylorin no way mitigates the seriousness of this crime, or thetragic effects on both these young men's lives. Both werehonor students at St. James Academy; both were planningto attend college. Now one young man is recovering fromserious brain injuries, and the other is facing a prisonsentence. I ask myself, how could this have happened?  
 Deb: I tell ya how. Chris Hobbes is a homophobic animalwho should be put away.  
 Judge: I can only imagine how profoundly disturbing itmust have been for a young man of Chris Hobbes's fine,moral upbringing to be approached sexually by a malestudent, then to see him flaunt his lifestyle by bringinghis male lover to the prom and engaging in what has beendescribed as a highly provocative dance.  
 [Brian walks in the courtroom and sits in the row behindhis friends.]  
 Judge: Given the fact that he was drinking -- which heshould not have been -- I could understand how ChrisHobbes might lose control of his better judgement. Still,this does not excuse his actions. And so I have struggledto find the appropriant sentence to impulse for thisunfortunable crime. Court will recess in 10 minutes.  
 [The judge stands up and leave the room.]  
 Deb: Where the f*ck is he going?  
 Emmett: It's the hell of a time to leave.  
 Ted: Great suspense.  
 Mel: It's how he's got his name "regular boy".Every day at 12:15 on the dot he goes to the bathroomacross the hall, sits in the stall under the window andtakes a dump and has a smoke.  
 Emmett: No way!  
 Ted: You're gotta be kidding!  
 Mel: No matter who was sentensing.  
 [The judge returns to his place. Everyone stands up ,except Brian.]  
 Judge: Christopher Michael Hobbs, this court exceptyou're plea of guilty for a simple assault. Because ofyour age, because you have no previous offenses, andbecause you were unduly provoked, you are hereby given atwo-year suspended sentence and ordered to serve fivehundred hours of community service.  
 [The judge leaves the room. Chris Hobbs smiles and shakeshis lawyers hand.]  
 Deb: No, that's not right. Wait a minute. Wait a minute!  
 [In front of the building. ChrisHobbs and his lawyer were interviewed by some reporters.Deb and the gang are standing a little bit outside.]  
 Deb: Look at him. His practically f*cking murder. How heget's off free?  
 Mel: They made a deal. His lawayer agreed to pleadedguilty, the prosecutor reduced the charge from aggravatedto simple assault, and Roy sent him off with probationand service.  
 Deb: He'd have gotten more for bashing a dog!  
 Michael: It's okay, mom. Let's go home, get some rest.  
 Deb: Damn right I'm going home, but not to rest. I'mgoing to call every P-FLAG chapter in this country; we'renot putting up with this for one f*ckin' second. We'regoing to march, and we're going to carry huge signs, andlet this asshole judge know what we think of him.  
 Vic: That's enough.  
 Deb: We're gonna march on Washington, if we have to!  
 Vic: No, sis...  
 Deb: YOU'RE HEAR THAT?!  
 [Deb tries to run to Chris Hobbs, but she's pull awayfrom Michael and Vic. Deb cries on Michael's shoulder.]  
 Michael: It's okay. It's okay. He's not gonna get awaywith this. We're march, we're protest.  
 [At Brian's loft. Mike and Brianare alone. Brian reads something.]  
 Brian: Bullshit, bullshit, bullshit. All protests arebullshit. Well-meaning do-gooders marching around,carrying signs. Chanting? 'Hey, hey, ho, ho, homophobia'sgot to go'? Give me a goddamn f*cking prick.  
 Michael: So, I guess this means you're not going with us?  
 Brian: Hell no, I won't go!  
 Michael: So, you're gonna sit you there on you're ass anddo nothing.  
 Brian: Yeah, I guess so. Jesus, what the f*ck did I everdo without you to harangue me? When the hell are yougoing back, anyway?  
 Michael: I'm not.  
 Brian: I know.  
 Michael: Had Ted and Emmett tell you?  
 Brian: No, I managed to figured it out all by my littleself. I mean, I knew it wouldn't work out.  
 Michael: Oh, congratulations, right as usual.  
 Brian: It's not about me, asshole, it's about you. Imean, did you really think you'd be happy in Wisconsinliving as a doctor's wife?  
 Michael: Oregon. Portland's in Oregon.  
 Brian: Wherever the f*ck.  
 Michael: Maybe that's the problem. I don't know where thefuck I belong.  
 [Brian grabs Michaels arm and pulls Mike down for akiss.]  
 Brian: There. That's where. Well, will you go on and helpyou're mom and make the world safe for fags.  
 Michael: What is this? Is this our old chemestry book?It's look like this from highschool.  
 Brian: Yeah, it's... I'm doin' some research. I have anew client for a drug company.  
 Michael: Well, you must be thrilled. You'll be able toget E wholesale.  
 [Back in the courtroom bathroom.Judge Roy primps in the mirror, then takes his usualstall. He sits down, groaning in satisfaction. When he'sdone, he puts out his cigarette, then tries to get up offof the toilet. But he's stuck to it. Very stuck.]  
 [At Woody's, the gang watch anews report about Judge Roy's mishap.]  
 Reporter: "After spending 14 hours glued to a toiletseat the judge was unharmed but badly shaken..."  
 [all laughs.]  
 Mel: The seat of justice has been severely compromised.  
 Emmett: No skin off my ass.  
 Ted: I bet he wishes he could say the same thing.  
 Lindsay: Who do you think did it?  
 Mel: Someone who did can't wait for the sentence.  
 [Michael thinks about it and Brian's chemestry bookyesterday.]  
 Michael: You know what this reminds me of? That time inChemistry class when you said you were going to inventsynthetic cum, and you made that goo? And you put it allover the toilet seat in the teacher's lounge and Mrs.Renfro got glued to it.  
 Brian: I better take off.  
 [Outside the Taylor Condo, Justinand Brian toss around a whiffle ball. Daphne watches,sitting on the steps with Brian.]  
 Justin: I knew they led him go. They don't care about us;they wish we were all dead.  
 Brian: Look, don't think it's okay just focus on whatyou're doing.  
 Justin: sh1t! f*ck! [Justin curses when his hand seizesup.]  
 Brian: C'mon, you can do it.  
 Justin: No, I can't.  
 Brian: Yes, you can. C'mon.  
 [Justin tries one more time and got it.]  
 Daphne: Hey, that one was good, Justin.  
 Justin: Daph, you're so full of sh1t.  
 [Jen drives up.]  
 Jen: Hi, honey. Hi, Daphne. [Pause]  
 Brian: Hello, Mrs.Taylor.  
 Jen: Hello, Brian.  
 Brian: We're just tossing the ball.  
 Jen: I think you should rest, honey.  
 Justin: I'm not tired.  
 Jen: I'd like to speek to Brian.  
 Justin: C'mon, Daph.  
 [Justin and Daphne goes inside. Jen and Brian are allalone.]  
 Jen: The day they sent him home from the hospital, thedoctor said he'd never seen such a determined patient,and then he asked what it was that made him work so hard.I knew but I didn't tell him - it was you. Every day thatyou didn't come to see him was more incentive for him toget better so he could get out and he come and see you.Of course, what Justin didn't know, and I didn't tellhim, was that you were there, every night. The nurse onduty told me. I want to thank you for that. But he's homenow, safe and sound, and there isn't any reason anymorefor you to watch over him, so I would like you to leave.And never see him again.  
 Brian: I care about him.  
 Jen: It was because of you, he was almost killed. -Forgive me for being so blunt. I've tried to accept himfor who he is. To accept your world and his part of it.I've even tried to accept you. And as a result, I nearlylost him. And I don't intend to lose him again. And so,if you really care about him, and I believe you do,you'll do what I ask, and return my son to me.  
 [Brian tries to come up with something to say, butfinally just hands her the whiffle ball and walks to hiscar. Looking down the street, he sees two boys tossing abaseball to each other. Brian takes a depth breath, getsinto the Jeep, and drives away.]
