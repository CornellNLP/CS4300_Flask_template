 Paul: Number five sixty-six, five seventy-four.  
 Michael: Five eighty-three?  
 Paul: That one, too.  
 Michael: Well, thanks. At least I know where thediscrepancy is. David isn't cashing my checks.  
 Brian: Well, maybe he forgot. You know how people arewhen they get to be his age.  
 Michael: (pushing Brian, who's been staring at Paul) Comeon, let's go!

 (Mel is walking up to Lindsay'shouse. She pauses a bit, then continues to the door,ringing the bell)  
 Mel: Linds...  
 Lindsay: Mel...  
 Mel: I, um...came by to see Gus, and...Oh, Linds, I missyou so much.  
 Lindsay: I have waited so long to hear you say that.  
 Mel: I'm sorry, baby. I am so sorry for everything.  
 (they hug)  
 Lindsay: Me, too. And it doesn't matter whose fault itwas.  
 Mel: Now all that matters is this. (they start kissing)  
 (flash to reality. A frenchman is standing at the door)  
 Gui: Oui ?  
 Mel: "We"?  
 Gui: No, " oui ." As in, "is theresomething you would like"?  
 Mel: Uh, actually, yes. I'd like to see Lindsay.  
 Gui: Ah, Lindsay is not here right now. She's teachingclass.  
 Mel: And who are you?  
 Gui: I am Guillaume. And you are?  
 Mel: (with fake accent) Melanie.  
 Gui: Ah, Melanie, the ex-girlfriend.  
 Mel: You know who I am?  
 Gui: You're the one who had the affair. Of course, enFrance , this would be meaningless.  
 Mel: I-I can't believe she told you that.  
 Gui: Lindsay and I are very, uh, intime . Intimate.  
 Mel: I got it. Look, I stopped by to see my son.  
 Gui: (shaking head) Mm. I'm afraid that's not possible.It's his feeding time.  
 Mel: Well, I could do it. (she starts to go in but ispushed back by Gui)  
 Gui: No, no, no. I will do it. He gets very...um, what doyou call it? Uh, finicky.  
 Mel: Okay, who the f*ck are you anyway and why hasn'tLindsay ever told me about you?  
 Gui: Perhaps it's her decision, now that you're no longerliving together, not to share with you all the details ofher life. This is normal. (yelling to a crying Gus) I'mon my way, mon petit chou . (to Mel) So, I tell her youstop by. (he closes the door and she stands there, takenaback)  
 (In the locker room, Brian,Michael, Ted and Emmett are all changing)  
 Michael: Why would David keep taking my checks if he hasno intention of cashing them?  
 Ted: Well, maybe he's waiting until next quarter when hehas less tax liability.  
 Emmett: (laughs) Spoken like a true accountant.  
 Brian: Or maybe he's just taking them to humor you.  
 Michael: Well, I'm not amused. I can pay my own way.  
 Ted: Very noble.  
 Emmett: Yeah, and stupid. Michael, sweetie, it's everygay boy's dream to be a kept woman.  
 (Mel walks in and all the guys start hustling around,covering their respective members)  
 Mel: Christ, do you think I've never seen a dick before?  
 Ted: Not mine!  
 Emmett: It's okay! It's okay, everyone! She's a lesbian.  
 Guy: Oh, she's a dyke.  
 Michael: Melanie, what are you doing here?  
 Mel: I took your advice and I went to go see Lindsay. (toBrian) Uh, when was the last time you talked to her?  
 Brian: A couple weeks.  
 Mel: Did she mention anything about a French guy?  
 Brian: No.  
 Michael: A French guy?  
 Mel: I went over to see her and this f*ckin' froganswered the door.  
 Brian: So?  
 Mel: So, when I tried to see Gus, he slammed the goddamndoor in my face.  
 Ted: Well, everybody knows the French are famous foreclairs, oral s*x and rudeness.  
 Emmett: I once had a date that involved all three.  
 Brian: (calling Lindsay) Maybe she just got herself a newbabysitter.  
 Mel: From France?  
 Ted: A little pricey on her teacher's salary.  
 Mel: And how come she didn't tell us about it?  
 (Brian's listening to the phone as the answering machineat Lindsay's comes on and Gui says "Bonjour")  
 Brian: H-hey, listen to this. (he holds out the phone foreveryone to hear)  
 Gui: (on answering machine) "You've reached Lindsayand Guillaume and beautiful baby Gus. If you have amessage for us, kindly leave it after the beep."  
 Brian: "Us." (hangs up)  
 Emmett: Pretty pushy for the help.  
 Michael: Makes it sound like they're a couple.  
 Ted: (to Mel) Quelque chose isn't kosher.  
 (Justin's room. Deb knocks on thedoor and enters, bringing a tray of food and a drink, asJustin sits on the bed, drawing)  
 Deb: Hey. (she closes the door) You know the last time Ibrought hot chocolate and fig newtons up here?  
 Justin: When Michael lived here?  
 Deb: Smart kid. Hm. He'd lock himself in here for hoursand hours. Told me he was playing with his modelairplanes. Ha! I know what he was playing with.(chuckles. She sets down the mug) Here. (holds out theplate) Want one?  
 Justin: No thanks.  
 Deb: It's a lousy thing that teacher did, having yoususpended.  
 Justin: Yeah, I could punch dickhead Dickson's face in.Chris Hobbs, too.  
 Deb: Only then you'd be just like them. (she sits on theedge of the bed)  
 Justin: So what? They deserve it.  
 Deb: Sure they do. But there are better ways of handlingit.  
 Justin: Quit school?  
 Deb: And give them the pleasure? (she holds out the plateagain and takes a bite of one of the fig newtons) Hmm?(Justin shakes his head 'no') You know...there werepeople...when they found out that Michael was gay...whosaid and did the cruelest things. Friends... neighbors...family. My own goddamn sister wouldn't even let her kidscome over here. Was afraid Michael was gonna molest 'emor something. Because that's the way people are. They'reignorant and they're scared. And there's nothing you cando... except educate 'em or shoot 'em. Me, I joined PFLAG'cuz I figured it was more practical than shooting 'em.(she chuckles as she takes another bite. Justin smiles)Do you have a gay club at your school?  
 Justin: (chuckles) Are you crazy?  
 Deb: I've been accused of it.  
 Justin: No. I'm, like, the only gay student there.  
 Deb: I doubt that, Sunshine. Gay kids are everywhere.Only they're not all like you...'cause they're afraid toshow their faces. That's why maybe...you've got to dosomething to help them know that...they're not the onlyones.  
 (At the diner, Michael and Davidare eating and talking)  
 David: I didn't cash your checks because I don't needyour money.  
 Michael: But I need to give it to you.  
 David: Michael, you know, of course, that half themonthly expenses aren't really three hundred dollars.  
 Michael: Of course I know. I-I'm sure whatever it is, Icouldn't afford it, but that's not the point... that Iwant to contribute as much as I can.  
 David: And you do. You do. You give me something muchmore valuable than money. You give me your sweetness,your charm, your  
 humor, your hot little bod. What's paying half the gasand electric compared to that, Michael?  
 Michael: I'm not some boytoy you're keeping.  
 David: I've never thought of you as my boytoy. Don'tinsult me. (the check comes and Michael grabs it)  
 Michael: I'll take that.  
 David: Okay. Okay, whatever will make you happy. Whateveryou want.  
 Michael: What will make me happy is if you'll...take mymoney and you stop paying for everything.  
 David: Fine, from now on we'll only do things that we canboth afford to do. Together.  
 (Michael gets up to go pay for the food. David followshim)  
 David: There's only one thing.  
 Michael: What's that?  
 David: Don't get mad. It was supposed to be a surprise,but you know the the week that you have off from work? Icleared it for me too and I popped for...a trip to Paris.First class. Suite at the hotel " Georges V ."Reservations at all the finest restaurants.  
 Michael: Wow, that...that sounds fantastic.  
 David: (shaking his head) I know.  
 Michael: But--  
 David: No, I know. I know. It was the wrong thing to do.I'll, uh, cancel it tomorrow. And we'll just stay home,watch a movie. Or two. Eat in. And that can still be fun.  
 (David walks away as Michael stands there, lookingdumbfounded)  
 (Lindsay's house. Mel, Brian, Tedand Emmett are all waiting on the front porch as Melrings the doorbell. Lindsay answers)  
 Brian: Hi, Lindsay. Hope you don't mind us all droppingby like this.  
 Lindsay: Acutally, you could have called.  
 Mel: We did and got your message.  
 (they all start walking in, Gus fussing in thebackground. Lindsay shuts the door as Gui walks in,holding Gus)  
 Gui: (to Gus) Look who's here. (he sees everyone) Ah.Look who else is here.  
 Lindsay: This is Guillaume. (to Gui) I believe you've metMelanie.  
 Gui: Oui . Melanie. Comment ca va? Uh, how are you?  
 Mel: Uh, ca va . Just fine.  
 Lindsay: This is Brian, Gus' biological father.  
 Gui: Ah, oui . (Brian takes Gus from him) Be assured, myfriend. There is no need to worry about Gus now that I amhere.  
 Brian: Mmm, I wasn't worried when you weren't... mon ami.  
 Lindsay: And this is Ted and Emmett.  
 Emmett: Bonjour .  
 Ted: Bonsoir .  
 Gui: Enchante .  
 Lindsay: We were just in the middle of dinner so if youdon't mind.  
 Gui: Uh, if-if you would like, your friends may join us.There's enough rabbit for everyone.  
 Emmett: Rabbit?  
 Gui: Yes, I made a, uh, stew.  
 Emmett: With-with rabbit? Bunny rabbit?  
 Ted: They say it tastes just like chicken.  
 Gui: Please, uh, come try some.  
 (Mel looks at them)  
 Ted: Well, maybe just a...little taste.  
 (he starts following Gui to the dining room as Brian hitshim on the arm)  
 Emmett: (to Mel) I'm-I'm a little hungry, so... (he joinsTed and Gui in the dining room)  
 Mel: (to Lindsay) What's going on?  
 Brian: Yeah, who is this guy?  
 Mel: What's he doin' in our house?  
 Lindsay: Excuse me, I don't appreciate you barging inhere and interrogating me.  
 Mel: Whoa, who's interrogating who?  
 Brian: We're just asking.  
 Lindsay: Guillaume teaches French at the university.We've been friends for a couple of years.  
 Mel: Yeah, well, how come you never mentioned him?  
 Lindsay: I did. You just never listened. (Mel scoffs)Anyway, he needed some help, and so did I. So, I said hecould move in.  
 Mel: So why didn't you tell us?  
 Lindsay: We haven't exactly been communicating lately.  
 Emmett: Oh my god! This is fabulous!  
 Ted: Magnifique ! That's the best rabbit I ever had. Theonly rabbit I've ever had.  
 (They laugh and look at Brian and Mel, who is juststaring at them. They shut up)  
 Lindsay: Well, he's a...fantastic cook. And he'swonderful with the baby. Gus took to him immediately. AndI can't tell you what a relief it is having him help withthe mortgage.  
 Mel: Sounds like the perfect arrangement.  
 Brian: So how long is he staying?  
 Lindsay: That all depends.  
 Mel: Until he finds a place of his own?  
 Emmett: (to Ted) You're not gonna raise rabbits in yourcondo!  
 Lindsay: Until... (laughs nervously) we get married.  
 Brian: What?! (Lindsay chuckles)  
 Mel: Are you f*cking nuts?  
 Lindsay: Don't get so excited. It's just an arrangement.I can get some help. He can stay in the country and gethis green card.  
 Gui: Alors , I must insist that you come eat tout desuite or else it gets cold.  
 (Lindsay walks into the kitchen as Mel and Brian look ateach other)  
 (Woody's. Mel, Brian, Ted andEmmett are all there)  
 Mel: The way he insinuated himself.  
 Emmett: Right, like-like it was his house.  
 Ted: That he belongs there.  
 Mel: (to Brian) Like you and I were like a couple ofstrangers. I need a cigarette, bad. (Brian hands her apack) This is all my fault. If it weren't for me, none ofthis would be happening.  
 Brian: Aww, Melanie the Martyr. Do you want me to set youon fire? (he lights a lighter)  
 Mel: Asshole, just give me a light. (she grabs his armand puts the lighter to her cigarette, Brian moving itall around) You know, if she goes through with this, he'sgoing to have to live there for at least a couple ofyears.  
 Ted: By then, Gus will be smoking Gauloises and...notwearing deodorant. (Brian laughs)  
 Mel: And she'll have moved on with her life. There's noway we'll ever get back together.  
 Emmett: If only she knew how much trouble she could getinto. Well, you know, it's Lindsay... probably wouldn'tcare. She's always lookin' out for the welfare of others.  
 Mel: The generous one. And there's me, the selfish one.(Brian nods) I wanted a f*ck and boy did I get f*cked.  
 (Brian spots a guy walking by, giving him the look)  
 Brian: (while looking at the guy) There's nothing wrongwith getting your needs met.  
 Ted: That's no surprise coming from you. It's yourmanifesto.  
 Brian: Well, it could be everyone's if they were honestenough to admit it. (to Mel) Stop blaming yourself. It's boring. And you don't deserve it. (Mel smiles)  
 (Justin comes up beside Brian)  
 Justin: Hey.  
 Brian: Hey. (Justin walks to the other side of Mel) Isn't it a school night? Shouldn't you be at Deb's studying?  
 Justin: I got suspended.  
 Mel: You?  
 Justin: For two days. I saw this student getting bashed and my homophobic teacher wouldn't do anything about it.So I told him to f*ck off. (everyone laughs)  
 Brian: Go to the head of the class.  
 Ted: That brings back memories. Getting the sh1t kicked out of you on the playground.  
 Emmett: Hmm. Having lit matches thrown at you in the locker room. Good times.  
 Ted: Yeah.  
 (Mel and Justin laugh. Brian, Ted and Emmett all clink their beer bottles together)  
 Ted: (to Brian) I don't suppose anything like that ever happened to you?  
 Brian: Mm. Well, once this straight football jock picked me up and dumped my head in the toilet.  
 Justin: What did you do?  
 Brian: I followed him to his locker. It was open, his hand was up, kind of like this (mimics the hand placement) . He was laughing, so I slammed the door so hard it broke three of his fingers.  
 (Emmett and Ted groan)  
 Brian: And that was the end of the season for him.  
 (Justin looks away)  
 
 
 
 (Brian's loft. Brian and Justin are both naked, playing around on the bed, getting ready for some action)  
 Brian: A gay/straight what?  
 Justin: Student alliance.  
 Brian: What the f*ck is that?  
 Justin: It's a club. A forum where students discussissues, plan events. You know, to promote understanding.  
 Brian: I'm asleep already.  
 Justin: I need your expertise.  
 Brian: I think I've given you plenty.  
 Justin: (partially sitting up) Your business expertese.It's a tough sell, especially at St. James. So say Ibrought this concept to you at your office. How would youmarket it?  
 Brian: It's one thirty in the morning, and I'm horny ashell.  
 Justin: (whispers) Please?  
 Brian: (sighs) Okay. (He rolls over) You're the client.Have a seat Mr. Taylor. (Justin sits up, Brian startslaughing)  
 Justin: (playfully kicking Brian's arm) What's so funny?  
 Brian: (getting up) Well, this is just how I imagine allmy clients. I picture them naked. I can't believe I'mdoing this. Okay! (starts walking around) So you havethis concept. They "Gay-Straight StudentAlliance." Let's all live together. Power to thepeople. Peace. That's boring as sh1t.  
 Justin: I could take out an uzi and shoot everyone. Thatwould be exciting.  
 Brian: Well, at least you'd get their attention. Now, wehave to figure out a way to sell it.  
 Justin: Right. How?  
 Brian: Same way you sell everything else. (Brian sitsnext to Justin on the bed, holding out a condom) s*x.  
 Justin: s*x?  
 Brian: You wanna get 'em in the tent, hand out these.  
 Justin: (holding it) Condoms?  
 Brian: You said it was an alliance. What better way foreveryone to come together? (he grabs a handful and dumpsthem on Justin's head. Justin grabs one and throws itback at Brian. They start making out)  
 (The diner. Michael, Ted andEmmett are sitting at a table, eating breakfast)  
 Ted: He wants to take you to Paris?  
 Emmett: Honey, you're the luckiest boy in the world! Passme the syrup. I love Paris!  
 Ted: You've never been to Paris. (to waitress) Thank you.  
 Emmett: Well, I know I'll love it when I get there.  
 Ted: So, when are you leaving?  
 Michael: We're not.  
 Ted: Excusez-moi ?  
 Michael: I don't have the money for that kind of a trip.  
 Emmett: Course you don't. But David does.  
 Micahel: I told him I couldn't let him pay for me.  
 Emmett: Are you completely mad? Of course you can.  
 Michael: David and I have an arrangement. We only dothings that we can both afford.  
 Ted: Au Revoir, Paris. Bonjour, Pittsburgh.  
 Michael: All right, so I won't get to see the Seine atsunset or-or stroll through the Luxembourgh Gardens orany of the other wonderful stuff he had planned, but atleast--  
 Emmett: You'll have your pride?  
 Ted: Oh, I hear it's what everyone is wearing in Paristhis year.  
 Michael: David already takes me to dinner, and he buysthe groceries. He pays all the house expenses.  
 Emmett: Where do I sign up?  
 Michael: It's not right.  
 Ted: But if he wants to do it.  
 Michael: That's what he says. He says it makes him happy.  
 Emmett: Then stop being so goddamn selfish.  
 Michael: Selfish?  
 Emmett: I think it's selfish to deny your lover pleasure.  
 Ted: Listen to me, Michael. Money is my business. I'veseen it destroy more relationships than s*x, okay? Now,you think you're being fair to David with this falsepride thing of yours, but it will only cause resentmentand frustration, and  
 frankly...you're denying yourself the opportunity to goplaces that you could never go. Do things you could neverdo.  
 Emmett: It's like what Barbra said so eloquently in"Hello Dolly." Even though she was years tooyoung for the part. (in a fake accent, motioning with hishands) "Money is like manure. It isn't worth a thingunless you spread it around, encouraging things to grow."You know what I mean? (Michael smiles.) (to Ted) Kiss me,Horace.  
 (Ted starts laughing, Michael looking thoughtful)  
 (St. James Academy. The bellrings as we see Daphne and Justin standing in the hall, abox of condoms with "Gay-Straight StudentAlliance" written on the side, Justin's holding it)  
 Justin: (to guys walking by) There's a meeting afterschool for the Gay-Straight Student Alliance. (they justwalk by as he holds out a flyer. to some more peoplewalking by) Uh, uh, after school there's a meeting,Gay-Straight Student Alliance. (to a boy and girl walkingby) Hey, you want a free condom?  
 Girl: Yeah.  
 Justin: Here, you gotta take one of these. (holds out aflyer)  
 Guy: Cool.  
 Justin: Here.  
 Girl: Okay, catch ya later.  
 Justin: Sure.  
 Daphne: Um, there's a meeting after school. Please take afree condom and a flyer. (to Justin) Brian knows whathe's talking about.

 Chris: Hey, Taylor. (taking a handful of condoms anddropping them on the ground) You starting a faggot club?(Daphne goes down to pick them up)  
 Justin: It's for gay students and straight students.  
 Daphne: To promote tolerance and understanding.  
 Chris: So now butt-fucking is an extracurricularactivity?  
 Justin: No. Just hand-jobs.  
 (Chris grabs Justin by his coat and slams him against thewall, flashing back to the hand-job Justin gave himearlier that year)  
 Chris: (Justin smiling) You better never mention thatagain, you little cocksucker.  
 (He let's Justin go and starts walking down the hall.)  
 (Lindsay and Brian are walkingthrough a park, talking, as Lindsay pushes the strollerwith Gus in it)  
 Lindsay: I admit, it's a little crazy.  
 Brian: Crazy? You know, if this is about money, I toldyou I'd help you out.  
 Lindsay: And you have. But I gotta start taking care ofmyself. I can't keep relying on you and Melanie.  
 Brian: Okay. But do you have to f*cking marry him?  
 Lindsay: But it's not a real marriage. It's just anarrangement.  
 Brian: Well, he should arrange something else.  
 Lindsay: If he was straight, he could meet someone, fallin love and get married. But because he's gay, there's noway and that's not fair.  
 (they stop at a bench and sit down)  
 Brian: Well, listen to the righteous indignation. Kindasounds like the Lindsay I used to know.  
 Lindsay: Oh, yeah, which Lindsay is that?  
 Brian: The last year in college when you turned into thatscary political dyke.  
 Lindsay: Oh, her. The one who started the petition tomake date rape punishable by castration. I even got youto sign.  
 Brian: Yeah, well, you always were one for a worth cause.Listen, Mel and I have been thinking--  
 Lindsay: Wait a minute. Did I just hear you say...Mel andI? Did you actually say that? Years I have stuggled toget 'Mel and you' to be civil to each other, even be inthe same room together. Now all of the sudden 'Mel andyou' are allies? Huh! (Brian looks away and Lindsay getsup) Well, I don't have time to worry about what myselfish, self-centered, narcassistic friends think. Ihave to think about my son and how I'm gonna raise andsupport him. I have to think about what's best for him.So I think you should just f*ck off! I'm sure that's athought you can understand.  
 (She leaves with Gus, as Brian sits on the bench)

 Justin: (to Daphne) Well, I guess we should get started,huh?  
 Deb: Well... (she kisses him on the cheek) Good luck,Sunshine. (she wipes off the lipstick she left on hischeek) You too, Daphne. Knock 'em dead.  
 Justin: (clears throat) Could we have your attention,please? (they ignore him so Debbie makes a loud whistle,getting everyone's attention)  
 Deb: Thank you. (she goes to the back of the class)  
 Daphne: Hi. Um, I'm Daphne. (reading from some cards)Welcome to the first meeting of the St. JamesGay-Straight Student Alliance. In the upcoming weeks wewill be discussing issues that affect all of us here atSt. James--

 (everyone agrees)  
 Justin: s*x is part of it. But it's also about otherthings. Like how we see ourselves and each other.  
 Girl: (laughs) f*ck this. Let's go.  
 (they all start getting up to leave)  
 Justin: Faggot! Cocksucker! Homo! Fudge-packer! Those area few of the names that I have been called... because I'mgay. I've also been told that I'm going to hell and thatI should die of AIDS. (they all start to sit back down)Maybe the same thing has happened to you. That is whywe're here. To see if we can learn to accept ourdifferences and recognize our similarities. Because gayor straight we all want the same things.  
 Mr. Dickson: All right, Taylor. That's enough.

 Mr. Dickson: I'm a member of the faculty.  
 Deb: Then you'll be happy to know that we're having alittle educational program here. So why don't you sitdown. You might learn something.  
 Mr. Dickson: (holding a condom) Is this a part of yourcurriculum?  
 Deb: You bet your ass it is.  
 Mr. Dickson: Now all of you, on your way, this meeting isover. Come on, let's go!

 (He gets under the covers, facing away from Michael. Theylay in silence for a little bit)  
 Michael: David?

 Michael: Do you think I'm selfish?  
 David: You? What kind of a question is that?  
 Michael: I mean about...n-not taking you up on yourgenerosity, like-like going on this trip.  
 David: Michael... (turns around so he's facing Michael) Ialready told you. All I wanna do is make you happy.  
 Michael: Yeah, but what about you? (whispering) Whatwould- what would make you happy?  
 David: What would make me happy? Seeing you see Paris forthe first time...sailing down the... Seine on abateau-mouche, having the best meal of our lives at..."The Grand Vefour " or, uh, "AlainDucasse." Seeing your eyes light up when you findsome neat little toy at a flea market. That would make mehappy. (Michael starts rubbing David's shoulder) Thatwould make me very happy.  
 Michael: I want you to be happy.  
 David: Are you saying you want to go?  
 Michael: Well, since you already went ahead and make theplans and everything.  
 David: Don't do me any favors.  
 Michael: (shakes head) No, just promise me you'll let mepay for something every once in a while.  
 David: I'll let you pay for the baguettes. (they smileand David kisses Michael's shoulder) What do you say wepractice our French?  
 (They start kissing. David then proceeds to move southand gives Michael a blow-job)  
 (Lindsay and Gui are looking at awhole table full of pictures of them and Gus, picking outthe ones they like best)

 Gui: Oui. We do make a handsome family. Yeah?  
 Lindsay: Mm-hmm.  
 Gui: We should put this one in a frame... (grabs a frame)instead of that one.  
 (The picture in the frame is of Brian feeding Gus)  
 Gui: Brian. Very beautiful.  
 Lindsay: Lots of guys would agree with you.  
 Gui: Especially his lips. They're quite kissable, yes?(smiling)  
 Lindsay: (taking the frame) No.  
 Gui: Oh, la la, you needn't worry. I can tell he doesn'tlike me. And neither does Melanie or your otherfriends...  
 Lindsay: It's not you they don't like. It's what we'redoing. But it's not their decision.  
 Gui: Well, you are a wonderful person, Lindsay. (shemakes a face) No, no, no, it's true. If it weren't foryou, I'd have to leave the states. Now I'll be able tostay.  
 (the doorbell rings and Gui gets up to answer it. Youhear the door open, then close as Gui walks back in)  
 Gui: Cherie, c'est Melanie. (Mel walks in) Uh, Gus shouldbe up from his nap. I'll go check.  
 (He goes up the stairs as Mel joins Lindsay in the livingroom)  
 Mel: I guess if Gus likes him, he must be okay. Gus knowsthe difference between who's an asshole and who's not,right?  
 Lindsay: Right.  
 Mel: (looking at the pictures) What are these?  
 Lindsay: Oh, just some photographs. It's important tocreate a history in case immigration ever decides to paya visit.  
 Mel: Oh, jesus. (sits on the arm of the couch) I can'tbelieve you're going through with this-this...  
 Lindsay: What?  
 Mel: Charade. And for who? Somebody you don't even know.

 Mel: I don't care who he is. It's the most meshugueh ideaI ever heard of. I guarantee you if I had been here--  
 Lindsay: Well, you're not. You're not here.  
 Mel: I wish I was. (she sits by Lindsay) I miss you,Linds.  
 Lindsay: You're just saying that because of Guillaume.  
 Mel: (giggles) No, I'm not. (touches Lindsay's hair) Imiss you every minute of every day. And if I could missyou more than that, I would.  
 Lindsay: You think I don't miss you?  
 Mel: (looks away) Then why aren't I here? I mean, whyaren't we raising our son together? It doesn't makesense.  
 Lindsay: Well, it did at the time. I mean, all the thingsyou said...that I didn't give you enough affection...that I was only concerned about getting my own needs met.  
 Mel: I was wrong. It was me. I became...jealous andresentful and...I demanded way too much.  
 Lindsay: You were hurt.  
 Mel: So were you.  
 Lindsay: Yeah. Well...I guess we're only--  
 Mel: Human? (they both laugh)  
 Lindsay: Yeah.
