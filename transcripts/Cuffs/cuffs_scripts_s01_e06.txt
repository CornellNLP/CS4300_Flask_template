 Her name is Valeria Dukes. She's a mid-stage Alzheimer's patient. 
 She has longish grey hair. Second time this month she's done it. 
 She keeps trying to go home. 
 All right, thank you very much. 
 We'll get back to you as soon as we find anything. Cheers. 
 Radio : Any unit for an immediate graded call to Ditchling Beacon? 
 We have reports of concern for an elderly female wearing a white nightdress. 
 Control, this is Kilo Two Two Zero. 
 We've just taken a report of a high risk misper with Alzheimer's who fits that description. 
 Show us State Five, please. Thank you. 
 How could she have got this far? 
 She's only a little old lady in a nightdress. 
 I had an 80-year-old misper once. 
 Nearly got to London barefoot. 
 No way! 
 Way. 
 Hey, that's her! 
 We'll intercept her at the next bridge. 
 ( Siren blares ) 
 Hey! 
 Don't! You'll startle her. 
 Control, this is Kilo Two Two Zero. Priority. 
 Radio : Priority caller, go ahead. 
 We've located Valerie Dukes, the Alzheimer's misper. 
 'She's on the Heritage Railway track, under the bridge. We need to make urgent contact with the line to stop the trains.' 
 Kilo Two Three Zero. Show as State Five, over. 
 Radio : There's an oncoming train in that vicinity. 
 The train is in section, the driver cannot be contacted. 
 Control, we need immediate authorisation to go on the tracks. 
 We have a vulnerable person in danger. 
 Radio : You do not have authorisation, PC Draper. 
 Another patrol is on the way to assist. 
 You must not go on the track, PC Draper. 
 I repeat, do not go on the tracks. 
 This is ridiculous. 
 What do we do? 
 Go that way and try to stop the train. 
 Go! 
 Valerie, there's no need to be alarmed, OK? 
 I'm PC Draper. I'm a police officer. 
 I'm going home. 
 Leave me alone. 
 Valerie, you need to come off those tracks. 
 Hey! 
 Give me your hand. 
 ( Police siren sounds ) 
 ( She whimpers ) 
 Hey! Stop! 
 I want to help you. 
 Stop! 
 There we go. 
 It's all right. I've got you. I've got you. 
 That was close. 
 That was amazing. 
 ( Title music plays ) 
 It was a blatant disregard for policy. 
 Correct protocol was to flag down the train and wait for backup, not to go on the tracks. 
 Sir... 
 You have a duty of care, not only to members of the public, but also to your colleagues, some of whom are young and inexperienced enough to actually trust you. 
 If your actions ever put them in danger again, there will be severe consequences. 
 Do you understand? 
 Batman's getting his wings clipped, eh? 
 Morning. 
 Hey. 
 DS Moffat. 
 'I've got a Leila Kamal who wants to speak to someone.' 
 What's it about? 
 She won't tell me. It's personal, apparently. 
 Oh, all right, I'll send somebody down. Cheers. 
 There's a woman in downstairs, says she needs to speak to someone about a personal matter. Can you go? 
 No, no, I can't. I've got paperwork. I've cleared the day. 
 Why can't you go? 
 I'm studying. I've got the board tomorrow, remember? 
 Biggest day of my career. 
 You aced all the others. 
 Come on, help me out. 
 Heads or tails? 
 Tails. Heads! No, tails. 
 Oooh! Nightmare. Sorry about that. 
 Shame as well cos I would've gone. 
 What happened? What did they say? 
 Don't want to talk about it. 
 Well, they're wrong. 
 I broke the rules, didn't I? 
 To save a life. They should be thanking you for what you did. 
 Neither of those guys would've had the guts. 
 Look, can we just get back to work, yeah? 
 Leila Kamal? 
 She must have left, Sarge. 
 I've told you, there wasn't time. 
 I'd just stepped off the boat. 
 They came up behind, pushed me, grabbed my wallet and phone and made off, and that's it. 
 You didn't see anything? 
 No! 
 Mr Hollins, you've been badly injured. 
 There are slash marks on your arms and you've two broken ribs. 
 That seems like a lot of trouble to go to for a Nokia phone and a wallet. 
 What are you suggesting? 
 He's asking if you can remember anything at all about your attackers? 
 And I've told you, no. 
 What do you want me to do?! Start making it up?! 
 Bob, come on. Take it easy. 
 He's got a bad heart. 
 Better let him get some rest, then. 
 If you do remember something, you know where we are. 
 Time wasters. As if we've nothing better to be doing. 
 Excuse me. 
 Sorry. I know you're very busy. It's just... 
 I think I might need your help. 
 What? 
 Eh? 
 What? 
 Nothing. 
 It's just, you know, you seem better. 
 Better? 
 Yeah. You... sorted it with your fella? 
 Yeah. Stop fishing, Carl. 
 What?! I'm just being a mate. 
 Look, all you need to know is that I've finished it. 
 All right? We're moving on. 
 Wish I could. Sandy's a nympho, Bethany's a she-devil, I'm a wreck. 
 Sorry about that. 
 You know... 
 I don't know. Sometimes desperate... times call for desperate measures, don't they? 
 What are you talking about? 
 Cheers, fella. Thank you, mate. 
 Doesn't matter. 
 What sort of strange behaviour? 
 He's... 
 He's just... not himself. 
 The tyres on his car were slashed last month at the harbour... 
 .. but Bob wouldn't report it. 
 And I used to bring his lunch to the boat everyday. 
 I'd sit with him while he ate. 
 It was our ritual. 
 And couple of weeks ago, he told me to stop. 
 Said he doesn't want me coming down there any more. 
 And what about at the house? 
 He's been getting some phone calls late at night. 
 He won't tell me who he's talking to. 
 I can hear him shouting downstairs. 
 See, he needed some repairs on the boat a few months back. 
 Bob got the money from somewhere, but... 
 I'm scared he's done something stupid, taken out a loan, got mixed up with some bad people. 
 You don't think he has, do you? 
 We'll have to look into it. 
 You free? 
 I... 
 Can you run a PNC check for me? 
 Yep. 
 Bob Hollins. Owns a tug boat down on Shoreham Harbour. 
 No, nothing's coming up. 
 OK. Get your coat. 
 What? No. Er... No. 
 I'm on desk duty. I've got all those reports to file. 
 Reports can wait. You've two years on the marine unit. 
 I need you on this. 
 Let's go. 
 Jake? 
 See you downstairs. 
 You all right after this morning? 
 I wasn't anywhere near the tracks. 
 Look, I know what Ryan did seems impressive, but it's a dangerous stunt. 
 I'd don't want you following in his footsteps. 
 You'd rather I follow yours? 
 Sitting behind a desk all day, watching other people risk their lives. 
 I do my job. 
 Yeah. Well, he went beyond his cos he wasn't thinking about himself, he was thinking of someone else. 
 But then I guess that's something you're too familiar with, is it? 
 ( Screaming ) 
 OK, can everyone keep back, please? 
 Can you keep back? Can you put that away, please? 
 I need you to move over. Can you put that phone away, please? Step back! 
 Come on, it's quite dangerous here. 
 Are you all right, Mish? 
 Can everyone just...? Why don't you just stand behind this iron thing? 
 Thank you, sir. 
 Mish, I don't get it. What's going on? 
 Look. There, look. 
 Oh. Oh, God! 
 Are you serious? 
 Yeah. No, sorry, they freak me out. 
 I'm not joking. I don't... 
 Come on, it's fine. 
 Jesus! I wasn't expecting that. Mish! 
 I should stop those kids. You guys got this, yeah? 
 Yeah, of course. 
 Hey! Guys! You can't do that here. 
 Stop it, now! 
 It's a free country. 
 Move it along, now! 
 It's got nothing to do with not being manly. 
 Shh, don't scare it. 
 See? Easy. 
 Uh-huh. 
 Thank you for alerting us. 
 That was Maggie Hollins. Bob's discharged himself from hospital. 
 Insists on getting back to his boat right away. 
 This the one? 
 Yeah. 
 It's a tidy little number, isn't she? 
 Right... you're the expert. 
 What are we looking for? 
 Er... drug smuggling, any number of things. 
 Suspicious modifications to the vessel... minor damages... unusual activity. 
 Come on, then. 
 Yeah. 
 About bloody time. 
 All right? 
 Hi. 
 So, where is it? 
 It's under there. 
 Under there? Whose brilliant idea was that? 
 Hers. It was. 
 Well, what were we supposed to do? We can't just pick it up. 
 Why? 
 Cos it could be poisonous or something. 
 Poisonous? 
 It's an iguana. They're harmless. 
 In fact, this fella looks well-minded. 
 Clean skin, no scratches. 
 I bet his owner is worried sick about him. 
 Should've looked after it better then, shouldn't they? 
 What, like throwing a coat over him? 
 ( He scoffs ) 
 Yeah. OK, thank you. We should be getting on. 
 Yeah, can I...? Can I touch it? 
 Oh, now you want to touch it? 
 Yeah, of course. 
 Always wanted one of these ever since I was a kid. 
 It won't hurt you. 
 I'm about as skilled with lizards as I am with the ladies. 
 It's just about knowing the right way to handle them. 
 Oh, is it? Do I...? Do I need a firm grip? 
 OK, come on, St Francis. We've got work to do. 
 Yeah. 
 I... I should probably get going. 
 Hey! Have you got a card or something? 
 What an annoying cow. 
 Who? Orla? 
 Bossing everyone around. I can't stand people like that. 
 No wonder she works with animals -- probably the only ones that can put up with her. 
 We still on for training tonight? 
 Erm... 
 I thought you wanted to reach your target. 
 Yeah, I do want to reach... 
 So it takes commitment, Lino. 
 You can't just keep flaking out every time you don't feel like it. 
 I'm not flaking out. I'm not. 
 What about Alice? 
 What about Alice? 
 Doesn't she ever expect you to be at home? 
 What? 
 ( Phone beeps ) 
 Who is it? 
 It's the bossy cow. She wants to go for dinner sometime. 
 Here we go. Boss? 
 You OK? 
 Yeah, yeah, yeah. 
 Just a little bit of indigestion, that's all. 
 This is the AIS -- Automatic Identification System -- it's a radar. 
 It lets the port track ships coming in and out. 
 It's meant to be kept on at all times, but this has been disabled. 
 It looks like... 
 Bob doesn't want people to know where he's going. 
 Let's get surveillance on this. 
 Hey! 
 What do you think you're doing? 
 Radio : Any unit for an ASB call to the seafront, please? 
 Reports of youths jumping over railings, causing a disturbance. 
 That better not be Corey. 
 Control, this is Kilo Two Two Zero. Show us State Five. 
 ( Siren blares ) 
 Oi! 
 Get on the wall. 
 Get back there. 
 This is public disorder, boys. What's happening? 
 We're only messing around. 
 You could've caused a major incident, someone really hurt. 
 We'll let you off with a warning this time, but if it happens again... 
 We will arrest you. Is that understood? 
 Go on! Go home! 
 PJ! 
 Where are you going? Come here. 
 Hi, Mr Draper. 
 Is Corey here? 
 No. 
 PJ, do you want me to call your mum? 
 ( He sighs ) 
 Yes. He's up there, having a smoke with Dan. 
 Right. 
 Don't be too hard on him. 
 I used to nick Mum's ciggies all the time. 
 I'm not having it. He's been told. 
 That's two strikes and I'm coming down on him like a ton of bricks. 
 Oi! 
 What are you doing? What the hell is this? 
 Get off him. What the hell is this?! 
 That's my son! 
 Dad, what are you doing? 
 ( All shout over each other ) 
 Get off him! 
 Leave him alone! 
 He is my son! 
 Ryan! 
 No! 
 What is wrong with you?! What is wrong with you?! 
 What is wrong with you?! 
 Stop it, Dad, please. 
 Hey. Get off him! Get off him! Get off him! 
 Give me the keys. 
 Give me the keys. I'm taking the boys home. 
 Corey! 
 Don't speak to him! 
 I should report you. 
 Will you be all right? 
 Going to go to my gran's. 
 Corey... 
 I can give you a lift. 
 It's OK. 
 ( Phone rings ) 
 DS Moffat. 
 'Oh, Jo, thank God!' 
 ( He groans ) 
 Carl? Where are you? 
 'Can you...? Can you come to the toilet?' 
 What? 
 'Look, I'll explain when you get here. Please?' 
 All right, I'm coming. All right. 
 Hello? 
 Carl? 
 Yeah. 
 Ooh... Ooh, shouldn't you be at home? 
 I could ask you the same thing. 
 Sandy know you're here? 
 No. I... 
 I told her I'm on nights so that she didn't find out that I'd... 
 I've had the... 
 What? 
 Don't joke please. 
 Boss wants me down the docks at 5am and, mate, I feel like I'm on fire down there. 
 Oh, my God! 
 Can you do me a favour? 
 Yeah, of course. 
 Could you, er, get me some painkillers and... 
 .. a bag of frozen peas? 
 Yeah. Yeah. Are you all right? 
 Yeah, yeah, I'm fine. 
 All right. 
 Well, just stay there. 
 Go, go, go. Let's smash your personal best. 
 Come on, head up, mate! Let's do it!

 Control, this is Romeo India Four Eight Two. 
 We've got eyes on him now, over. 
 Do you want a mint? 
 They're chewy. 
 Thanks. 
 I like it when they're warm. 
 OK. 
 OK. 
 
 
 
 Right. Morning, all. 
 Morning. 
 Morning. 
 OK, so Ryan called in sick today, so we're going to be shaking things up a bit. 
 What's going on there? 
 Jake, you'll be riding with Donna. 
 ( She gasps ) 
 And, Lino, you will of course be single-crewed. 
 Molto-bene. 
 Right, kicking off today... 
 Can't remember the last time I was let off the leash! 
 Yeah, all right! Don't look too happy about it. 
 Like the Lone Ranger, me. Out on a limb, fighting crime. 
 You going to wear a cowboy hat? 
 Yeah, well, there's no-one to stop me! 
 Erm, what you doing? 
 I am just getting a water. Relax. 
 Oh, yeah. All right. 
 I'll miss you, too. 
 No, you won't. 
 Perfect team. Gayest crew in Brighton. 
 Y'us! 
 So, what happened yesterday, then? 
 What do you mean? 
 Why's Ryan pulled a sickie? 
 Maybe he's sick. 
 Ryan? No chance. 
 He's not invincible. 
 Maybe not, but he's never taken a single day off work before either. 
 Ms Kamal? 
 Go through. 
 I don't even think this is really a police matter. 
 My sister was the one who told me to come. 
 For all I know, he's just away on business and forgot to call me. 
 Right, so let's just get this timeline straight. 
 You met on this website about three months ago, right? 
 But we've been in touch everyday since. 
 Emails, texts... 
 We talk most nights before bed. 
 I speak to him more than I do my own family. 
 But you've never actually met him? 
 You sound just like them. 
 If only I'd married a good Pakistani boy instead of my career, I wouldn't have to date online then, would I? 
 Look... he has a business based in Germany, but he's from Brighton originally. 
 He's planning on moving back here. 
 That's the whole point, look. 
 That's Anthony's house, see? 
 He's buying it for when he comes back. 
 I even went to a viewing for him. 
 They'd exchanged contracts and everything, and then there was some... problem with the exchange rate and he was £5,000 short, so... 
 So, you offered to help him out and now he's disappeared with your money? 
 It just doesn't make sense. 
 If you knew Anthony... 
 So, am I right in thinking, Leila, that you wish to report a theft? 
 The Empress. 
 Fertility. 
 Careful. 
 Pretty girl like you. 
 ( Girl screams ) 
 You b*st*rd! You're going to pay for this! 
 So if you're not going to dish on Ryan, you might as well tell me what it feels like to be Julia Roberts. 
 What? 
 Sleeping With The Enemy. 
 Ah. Bit before my time. 
 Oh-ho-ho! That's depressing. 
 But if you're asking how things are going with Simon... 
 Pretty good, thanks. I'm staying at his at the moment. 
 Careful. 
 The only reason snakes get into bed with people is so they can size them up before they eat them. 
 I've been researching reptiles. 
 Don't ask. 
 'Any call-sign, please, to an immediate graded call to a violent disturbance under the arches at Madeira Drive.' 
 Control, this is Kilo Two Three Four. 
 'I'll get that.' 
 Let's give him a hand, shall we? 
 ( Siren blares ) 
 Police! Put down your weapons. 
 She said she was on the pill! 
 I'm gonna kill you! 
 Put that weapon down. 
 I'm gonna kill you! 
 Put the weapon down and don't resist me. 
 Don't touch... 
 Yeah, yeah, yeah. He's been kicked in the balls. 
 That is it, you're coming with us! Put your weapon down. 
 Put your weapon down! Hands behind your back. Keep still. 
 He made my daughter pregnant. 
 That is a shame, but I am still arresting you for assaulting a police officer, suspicion of criminal damage, affray and possession of an offensive weapon. 
 You do not have to say anything, but anything you do say... 
 Bet you didn't see that coming, eh? 
 Mad mum on a rampage! 
 People are maniacs when it comes to their kids. 
 He'll be lucky to have kids after that. 
 Cheers. 
 He's been at sea all day and he hasn't towed a single boat into port. 
 So, what's he been doing out there? 
 I think he's got company. Black van? 
 Got it. 
 Can't make out the plates. 
 One of us'll have to go over there. 
 Do you mean me? 
 I'll keep an eye on this. 
 And this one's of a little duckling. 
 She rescued it last week. 
 A cat dragged it in and it's still alive. Look at that. 
 Look at its little feathers. 
 Mm. 
 Best job ever. 
 So what time you meeting her, then? 
 We said seven. 
 We did say seven. 
 Thing is, if I go back out there now, I could... 
 I could get dragged into all sorts and who knows what time I'll finish. 
 And I don't want to be late for a first date. 
 That's just... It's bad manners, isn't it? 
 Yeah. 
 Don't suppose you've got anything you need help with round here, have you, Mel? 
 Nope. Sorry. 
 (Thanks.) 
 ( Man urinates on floor ) 
 Although... now you mention it. 
 ( He scoffs ) 
 Could be worse. I'll get the mop. 
 Sarge? Sorry, I know you're studying Only got another two hours to go, so if I don't know it by now... 
 We've tracked the IP address for Anthony Tovey. 
 It's an account in Turkey. 
 Nice. 
 And look... 
 They're taken from a website that promotes Italian holidays. 
 Wow, so either this guy models on the side or... 
 It's fraud. 
 But I mean... 
 Are you sure? 
 Positive. 
 We have cases with the same MO in Reading, Manchester... 
 A well-off businessman gains a victim's trust and then manoeuvres a situation where the victim volunteers to loan him money. 
 Victim?! 
 I'm hardly some little old lady sat at home with a cat! 
 I spoke to Anthony every day. 
 There is no Anthony, Leila. 
 This is a highly organised gang at work. 
 They're very good at what they do and they're very hard to catch, but we're monitoring this website. 
 ( Ringtone ) 
 Would you like to get that? 
 No, sorry. 
 It's just the office. 
 How could I be so stupid? 
 I'm an intelligent woman. 
 I'm a managing director. 
 People rely on me to make huge decisions every day. 
 I just wanted someone to share my life with. 
 I knew he was just a voice on the end of a phone... 
 .. some texts... but I've been on my own so long I thought... 
 Well, at least it's something. 
 Jo Moffat? 
 'Something's better than nothing, isn't it? 
 'When did I start believing I was worth so little?' 
 Are you ready? 
 What are you doing? 
 Boss? 
 'Go ahead.' 
 The licence plates are false. 
 That doesn't surprise me. 
 Ooh. Hold on. 
 Yes, he's signalling. I think he is about to move off. 
 Hold where you are. 
 Get over to the boat. A diver's doing the pick up. 
 Move now! 
 Roger. 
 ( He sighs ) 
 Police, stay where you are! 
 Control, this is DI Kane. I need backup to Shoreham Docks. 
 We have a suspected drugs exchange between a male on the dock and a black transit van. 
 Stop! 
 The van is now exiting the quays heading west. 
 I'm pursuing the male with DC Hawkins. 
 ( Hawkins groans ) 
 ( He groans ) 
 Get in! 
 ( Screeching tyres ) 
 ( Screeching tyres ) 
 Control -- DI Kane. 
 I need a talk-through with the attending unit. 
 Bravo India Four Eight Two. Go ahead. 
 Go to the coast road ASAP. 
 The male has gone over the security fence towards the East Shoreham beach. 
 Received that, en route now. 
 ( Sirens blare ) 
 There he is. 
 He's got nowhere to go. 
 Yeah. 
 Go, go, go! 
 Hands behind your back! Keep still! 
 You got him? 
 Got him. Keep still. 
 Nice work. 
 Control -- Kilo Two Three Zero. Show us State Nine. 
 We have the male in custody. 
 Can you make sure that DI Kane is aware, over? 
 Confirmed. Thank you. 
 Sorry, boss. 
 You said you were OK. 
 Yeah. Er... 
 It's... the stitches. I had the snip a few days ago and it's taking some time to heal. 
 Are you saying you weren't fit for duty and you didn't tell me? 
 I couldn't tell anyone. 
 I haven't even told Sandy. This is a personal situation. 
 We all have personal situations, DC Hawkins, but we do NOT bring them to work. 
 You could have cost us this entire operation. 
 Sarge? 
 Yeah. 
 Look. 
 She sent it ten minutes ago. 
 Blimey, she's still in denial, isn't she? Poor thing. 
 She's an idiot, wasting her time. 
 If she was my sister, I'd give her a slap. 
 ( Phone rings ) 
 Sorry, I've got to take this. 
 Hello? 
 'Can you come to my office, please? 
 'Now.' 
 Yeah, sure. I'll be right there. 
 Come in. 
 I've... 
 I've got some news for you... 
 Right. 
 Congratulations. 
 You passed. 
 Yes! 
 You are now officially Detective Sergeant Jo Moffat! 
 Yes! 
 Oh, my God. 
 Well done. I was really impressed in there. 
 You made all the right moves, said all the right things. 
 Well, I worked hard. 
 You got this on your own merit. 
 You deserve this, Jo. 
 Cheers. 
 You know what they say -- don't go higher than a DI. 
 ( She laughs ) 
 Yeah, yeah, yeah, all right. 
 At least you can make a difference, huh? 
 You do make a difference. 
 Look, I... 
 I want to apologise. 
 You know, for the way that I've been acting recently. 
 I have been... 
 .. unfair to you. 
 I was only trying to... 
 I know, you've had a lot on. I know that. 
 I've missed you, Jo. 
 What are you doing? 
 We can't do this any more. 
 I can't keep running round in circles, hoping that one day there might be something in this for me. 
 I can't do it. 
 This is over. 
 We're over. 
 I think we should call it a night. 
 Evening, Mel. 
 PC Prager. What's he in for? 
 Suspicion of possession with the intent to supply illegal drugs. 
 Have you taken any drugs or consumed any alcohol in the last 24 hours? 
 I've never taken drugs in my life. 
 I hate the things. 
 They said it'd just be one pick up. 
 I'd take the boat out, a diver would attach something... 
 .. another'd collect. 
 I'd never even have to see it. 
 Except it wasn't just one, was it? 
 They kept coming back, making threats. 
 I told them I'd give them back the money. 
 I didn't want it no more. 
 But they said they'd hurt Maggie, so... 
 I've been a stupid bugger! 
 Ooh-hoo-hoo! Looking pretty slick for a man who's about get his arse kicked on the spinning machine. 
 Didn't you get my text? I'm taking Orla out for dinner tonight. 
 Oh. OK. Great. 
 What's this, a hot date? 
 Yeah, might be. Might be. 
 Well, just a word of advice -- don't put any more of that stuff on. 
 You don't want to kill her. 
 Molte grazie, tosser. 
 Good luck! 
 Yeah. Have fun. 
 So, you think Ryan'll be back tomorrow? 
 Hope not. 
 OK, spill it. 
 What the hell happened yesterday? 
 Jake. 
 Ryan caught Corey on the beach with another boy. 
 And he lost it. 
 I mean, he went completely crazy. 
 If I hadn't been there, he could have really hurt one of them. 
 Ryan? 
 Just when you think you know someone and... 
 ( Slams locker ) 
 Ryan's not like that. 
 You could've fooled me. 
 Have you tried talking to him? 
 I don't even want to look at him. 
 I'm not making excuses for him, OK? 
 But I've known him five years. Ryan's not a homophobe. 
 And if he lost it yesterday... 
 Trust me, he's harder on himself than anyone else. 
 Talk to him, Jake. 
 I just... 
 I don't want to think about it any more. 
 I just want to go home, relax and have a quiet one with my boyfriend. 
 ( Noisy bar hubbub ) 
 So... 
 You're Simon's new Bobby, then? 
 Yeah. 
 You're just jealous, Benny, cos he's so young and handsome. 
 Look at this stomach -- not an inch of flab on him. 
 What are you doing? 
 Come on, where's your sense of humour? 
 He's a cop -- hasn't got one. 
 That is not true. 
 Aw, I'm sure it's not true. 
 ( They laugh ) 
 Is that what they do? 
 That's exactly right. 
 All right, yeah, I can do that. 
 Oh... 
 Oh, no! 
 ( Muffled speech ) 
 It's quite nice, isn't it? 
 You know, I'm going to take off. 
 What? Why? 
 I've got somewhere to be. 
 Don't worry about him. Ignore him. 
 Yeah. 
 ( Laughter ) 
 ( He exhales deeply ) 
 ( Knocks on door ) 
 Hey. Carmen, erm... 
 Is your dad here? 
 Carmen, who is it? 
 Go and sit down, babe. 
 How are you? 
 I've been better. 
 I'm... I'm not proud of myself for... 
 For what happened yesterday. 
 He's my son. 
 I love my son. 
 I just... I just... 
 Look, I know. 
 OK, I know. 
 Can I come in? 
 Come in, yeah. 
 You're not OK with your son being gay. 
 I'm not a homophobic or whatever, yeah? 
 I need urgent assistance now. 
 I am on the fourth... 
 Get down! Put your weapons down! 
 Drop your weapons! 
 Get down on the ground! 
 ON THE GROUND! 
 STOP DOING THIS TO ME! 
 I HATE YOU! 
 You need to sort this out, boss. 
 You're going to be put forward for a Divisional Commander's Commendation. 
 I don't know how much longer I can do this. 
 Alice?
