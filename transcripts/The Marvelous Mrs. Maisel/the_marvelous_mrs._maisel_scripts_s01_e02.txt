 - [LIVELY CHATTER] 
- MIDGE: Nah. Now, seriously,   
 there's no f*cking way that Penny Pann   
 can compete with these tits!   
 [LAUGHTER]   
 - Do you love it? 
- LENNY: Do I love what?   
 Comedy.   
 Stand-up. Do you love it?   
 Seriously?   
 Well, I've been doing it a while.    
 Okay, let's put it like this.    
 If there was anything else in the entire world    
 that I could possibly do to earn a living, I would.    
 Anything. I'm talking dry cleaners to the Klan,    
 crippled-kid portrait painter, slaughterhouse attendant.    
 If someone said to me, "Leonard, you can either eat a guy's head"    
 or do two weeks at the Copa,"    
 I'd say, "Pass the f*cking salt."    
 It's a terrible, terrible job.    
 It should not exist.    
 Like cancer and God.    
 HONEY: Sorry.    
 I went to the Varick station instead.    
 - Why the hell would you do that? 
- 'Cause you like Varick better.    
 Jesus, Honey, you don't get to pick.    
 But do you love it?    
 [QUIETLY]: Yeah. He loves it.    
 Excuse me. Do I need a receipt for the bail money, or...    
 And next up in a night full of triumphs,    
 uh, Honey forgot to tell the cabdriver to turn the meter off.    
 He's up to    bucks and refuses to get paid in weed,    
 so I was wondering if maybe you... 
Of course. Here.    
 - Put it on my tab? 
- Sure.    
 Oh, and, hey, if you need any help finding a lawyer,    
 I've got a drawer full of cards.    
 Just don't tell anyone you know where I am.  
 -Lawyer?    
 - Receipt. 
- What? Oh.    
 Wha... What did you mean "lawyer"?    
 Wait, wh-what about a lawyer?    
 - Hold on. 
- You said    
 if I need help finding a lawyer.    
 Why do I need help finding a lawyer?    
 You got arrested, arrested means court, court means lawyer.    
 But why do I need a lawyer? I got bailed out.  
 -So?    
 - On the night I was arrested. 
- So?    
 - I didn't sleep there. 
- Where is this going?    
 I got bailed out on the night I got arrested.    
 It's almost like it didn't even happen.    
 - But it did happen. 
- But very quickly.    
 MY ADVICE: be your own lawyer.    
 - It's ticking. 
- I should...    
 - Uh, wait. 
- Yes?    
 What?    
 I...    
 You...?    
 I-I don't know what to do.    
 Well, it's morning.    
 Go have breakfast.    
 Lenny, for Christ's sake, I'm dying here.    
 Yes, sitting in the cab must be harrowing.

 - MIDGE: No. 
- JOEL: You tackled her.    
 A nudge. A gentle nudge.    
 You took her down like she had the ball at the ten-yard line.    
 I simply felt it went to the wrong person.    
 She'd waste it. 
And this is a very nice bouquet.

 Brutal. My wife is brutal.    
 It was perfect, wasn't it?    
 Yeah. Perfect.    
 [GIGGLES] Perfect wedding,    
 perfect breakfast, perfect life.    
 - So... 
- Hmm?    
 - Last chance. 
- For what?    
 We could still get that apartment around the corner.    
 - Joel... 
- We could eat here every day.

- We could be downtown people.    
 Close to the clubs, the park.    
 - You love the park. 
- Riverside's a park, too.    
 I thought you wanted to be a cool chick.    
 I can be a cool chick with a doorman    
 and a Kelvinator Foodarama refrigerator, can't I?    
 Yes, you can.    
 I really love that apartment.    
 I grew up in that building.    
 My parents are so close.    
 - Very close. 
- When we have kids,    
 we can just go upstairs, drop them off,    
 go downtown, and be cool cats by night.    
 We can have it all.    
 I'm not gonna say no to you.    
 Not after I saw what you're capable of.    
 - You love me, Joel?

 that first wife of his, and then she went nuts

 Joel showed up at our house with this tiny girl suitcase,     
 and he and Archie went into Archie's office     
 and shut the door, and all I could hear was     
 "bowling" and "pandas"... did you fight about bowling?     
 - No. 
- Was there a panda?     
 No. -Well, maybe it wasn't pandas, but it had a "P."     
 Joel left me for his secretary.

 Grab your Lythe-lines.     
 It's always those girls.     
 - What girls? 
- Those shorthand girls.     
 Girls who go to secretarial school and learn shorthand,     
 and that gives them entre to our husbands.     
 And once they have entre to our husbands,     
 our husbands entre right into them.     
 Shorthand girls.     
 I could have been a shorthand girl.     
 I could have gone out into the workforce with my shorthand,     
 but I didn't... I got married.     
 I did it the right way.     
 - Longhand. 
- That's right.     
 The worst part is, I didn't suspect a thing.     
 I just thought we were a great couple.     
 I did, too.     
 I told Archie constantly, "Midge and Joel,     
 they are a great couple."

 Richard went straight to a lawyer's office     
 with his suitcase and his portable bar,     
 and just like that, three became four.     
 Now five.     
 Who knows besides me?     
 My parents. Joel, Archie.     
 Well, we won't tell.     
 People will find out, eventually.     
 I should just come out with it and tell everyone     
 and get it over with.     
 All right, let's think this through.     
 If you do tell people, then at least     
 you could control the narrative.     
 You know what I mean...     
 frame yourself in the best light.     
 Done right, maybe you just get pushed back a row or two,     
 not all the way into "the corner."     
 Maybe.     
 Unless you think Joel is coming back.     
 'Cause if you think he's coming back, then it's better     
 you don't tell anybody, because then he'll be back,     
 and no one will have known he left.     
 But if you tell them he left, and then he comes back,     
 you'll still be the person that he left, only now he's back.     
 But they'll know that you were left,     
 even though you aren't left now.     
 And I don't know what corner of the room     
 you stand in to be that person.

- MAN: Quiet.     
 Mother-in-law called an hour ago,     
 said everyone in the family is sick. Everyone.     
 What the hell are you doing?     
 I said halter. That's a sweetheart.     
 - Halter! Halter! Halter! 
- Sorry, Mr. Maisel.     
 Your mother-in-law called and said the whole family is so ill     
 that break fast is canceled.     
 So ill, the holiest of holy days cannot happen.     
 If it's so holy, why do you keep the factory open?     
 - You want a smack in the face?

 Those people get paid by the piece.     
 You want to take a day's work away from them?

 Morning, Professor.     
 Good morning, Professor Weissman.     
 There it is.     
 Study it.     
 Now, this matrix is composed of two row vectors...     
 v-one and v-two, but the rank is only one.     
 Can anyone tell me why?     
 No. No.     
 No. No. Truman?     
 Because once it's reduced to echelon form,     
 there's only one independent vector.     
 Correct. Now, can anyone tell me the nullity of this matrix?     
 No. No. No. No.     
 - Truman? 
- Unbelievable.     
 I'm sorry. 
Do you have something to say?     
 You never call on me. 
You never call on anyone.     
 You only ever call on Truman.     
 Truman knows the answers.     
 Truman always knows the answers.     
 Yes, but we could know the answers.     
 Really? Did you?     
 No.     
 - Did you know the answer? 
- No.     
 No? Did you know the answer?     
 - No. 
- No.     
 So none of you knew the answer.     
 - ALL: No. 
- But Truman.     
 But we could have known the answer. That's the point.     
 Could have?     
 Could have. Charlie...     
 - Lance. 
- Could have doesn't count.     
 Maybe doesn't count.     
 "I took a shot" doesn't count.     
 Because this room is a sanctuary     
 from the variables in the outside world.     
 In this room, we deal with absolutes.     
 Period.     
 In this room...     
 this is what counts.     
 These two vectors are collinear.     
 They go... together.     
 And they will always go together.     
 This is the solemn vow made by mathematics.     
 In this room, v-two is never going to break that vow     
 and decide that it doesn't need the other vector anymore,     
 that it's gonna run off and become linearly independent.     
 V-two is never going to come home from work one day     
 and tell v-one, "You know what?     
 "I think I need my own vector space.     
 See ya."     
 And then v-one's dad has to come in and tell her, "No",     
 "you can't let v-two do that.     
 You-you got to go get v-two back,"     
 an impermanent solution,     
 because v-one's dad is not gonna be around forever     
 to solve all of v-one's problems.

 Hmm. Too hot.     
 I told her, "Three before   ." That was my mistake.     
 I waited too long between Miriam and Noah.     
 - I could only fit in two. 
- You need to drink the tea, honey.     
 But Miriam is Miriam.     
 She wanted to play and run around

 It's fine now.     
 There's beer in her refrigerator.

 she wanted to learn to drive?     
 Because she found pink driving gloves.     
 Everything with Midge starts with an accessory.     
 How's Abe taking all this?     
 Abe got up this morning and went to work.     
 The world could be ending, and he'd get up and go to work.     
 And if Columbia University fell into the ocean,     
 he'd work from home.

 We're all sick. That's what he knows.     
 Very, very sick. 
You did not see me today.     
 Who am I talking to? 
No one. I'm alone here.     
 Okay, let's take a look at this.     
 I failed her. I failed her somehow.     
 My whole family, everyone's married.     
 Abe's family, everyone's married.     
 I should've sent her to Paris. 
My mother sent me to Paris.     
 Paris is wonderful, but it's good Midge didn't go.     
 There was danger for her there.     
 - Too much bread. 
- Yes.     
 Okay, let's see.     
 I just need to know whether or not     
 this separation is actually going to happen.     
 - I see a hammer. 
- Is a hammer good?     
 It is if you want to hang a picture.     
 Please, Drina...     
 A hammer means triumph. You will triumph.     
 And the leaves say this journey will end in peace and happiness.     
 Triumph? Peace and happiness? 
You're sure?     
 - You're doubting the leaves? 
- No. Never.     
 Okay, you're still nervous. Drina knows this.     
 I'll tell you what.     
 I'll throw in a charm. Put this     
 under Miriam's pillow for a week.     
 It'll help the luck stick.     
 My God, what is that smell?     
 Tannis root. Just tell Miriam     
 a rat died in the wall or something.     
 - Thank you, Drina. 
- Don't worry.     
 Miriam will land on her feet.     
 Take it from me.     
 Hmm? Are you paying by check today?

 You know the last time I was up at  :   in the morning?     
 It was the last time I stayed out all night     
 and got home at  :   in the morning.     
 That is the last time I was up at  :   in the morning.     
 I'm sorry. It was a rough night.     
 Hey, you came to me, okay?     
 You know, I-I didn't ask you to bang on my door.     
 I didn't even tell you where my door was.     
 You figured out where it was     
 and then you came there and then you banged on it     
 - of your own free will. 
- I forgot.     
 Oh, much better.     
 It is so much better that you just forgot.     
 You know, my fear was that you remembered     
 and chose not to meet me.     
 But now that I know I literally didn't even enter into y...     
 Wh-Where the hell are we? What is this, f*cking Versailles?     
 It's my apartment.     
 Your table is set for   .     
 Who has cutlery for   ?     
 Jesus Christ, what is this, a landing strip?     
 Where is your airplane, in the bathroom?     
 I had no idea you were such an important person.     
 If I had realized that the queen of England had stood me up,     
 I would have understood. 
But I just thought     
 you were some drunk housewife 
who needed my help.     
 I had no idea you were related to f*cking Charlemagne.     
 'Cause if Catherine the Great had shown up and said,     
 "Hey, let's meet at   :  ," I probably wouldn't have expected     
 her to show up either. But you have to tell people who you are.     
 'Cause if all they have to go on is the fact     
 that you make appointments and then forget about them,     
 they're just gonna think you're a stuck-up twat.     
 It's an easy mistake to make.     
 I almost made that same mistake.     
 But then I saw your dining room was set for Parliament...     
 What the... What is this,     
 a backup place in case you get bored with the other one?     
 What the hell is going on here?     
 They've already eaten, Miss Miriam. 
Thank you, Zelda.     
 Hey, Zelda, have you seen the place downstairs?     
 - It will blow your mind. 
- Hi, lady.     
 What? Where are we going?     
 Why am I touching this child?     
 - Why is this child touching me? 
- Hi, lady.     
 Why is his hand sticky? 
Why is your hand sticky?     
 Where has his hand been that it is now currently very sticky?     
 [ELEVATOR BELL DINGS]     
 Hi, lady.  
 -Why am I still holding this child?     
 He can't find his way home from here?     
 I made it home just fine when my mother forgot me     
 at the Armistice Day Parade.     
 An old soldier with one arm gave me a nickel     
 and I took the bus home. 
Oh, you're welcome!     
 Real polite kid you got there. 
Good job.     
 Would you like some iced tea?     
 Hmm. Do I want some iced tea?     
 Let me think. f*ck you.     
 No, I do not want any iced tea.     
 [SCOFFS] First, you stand me up.     
 Then you Bataan Death March me through Buckingham Palace.     
 You make me hold your kid's filthy hand,     
 which means I probably got    different kinds of cholera right now.     
 Sit down. I'll get us some iced tea.     
 Sit where? Here? What, on this? 
Are you kidding me?     
 I'm not sitting in here.     
 This is not furniture for sitting!     
 This is furniture you get appraised     
 when a rich uncle dies.     
 You really should put plastic     
 - over all of this. 
- It's fine.     
 Are those two really your children     
 or did we just break in and kidnap a couple kids?     
 - Of course they're mine. 
- Well, just making sure.     
 I mean, when you fraternize with an ex-con...     
 Hey, did you know that I have to get a lawyer and go to court?     
 - Yes. 
- Even though I got     
 bailed out on the night I got arrested.     
 What the hell does that have to do with anything?     
 - So it's not a thing? 
- No, it's not a thing.     
 Why do I have it in my head that it's a thing?     
 I don't know, lady. Maybe it's all that royal inbreeding.     
 - This is not that fancy of an apartment. 
- [CHUCKLES]     
 It's just ridiculous. That whole getting arrested thing.     
 So I said some bad words.     
 Well, and you flashed the room.     
 - What? 
- You flashed the room.     
 You pulled your top down.     
 - Oh, I did not. 
- You did, too.     
 You hit a switch and out they came.     
 - That's ridiculous. 
- "Soup's on, boys!"     
 - If I did that, I'd remember. 
- Mm.     
 - Cake? 
- No, I do not want cake.     
 You know what, I would like to know what I am doing...     
 Oh, wow.     
 That-that is an adorable cake.     
 I'm sorry about today.     
 I really am.     
 Okay.     
 Let's just forget about this morning, okay?     
 I'm here. We can start now.     
 You have any paper? Pen?     
 Maybe parchment and a quill?     
 Why? -So I can write down some stuff for you     
 - to talk about onstage. 
- No, no, no.     
 Look, I'm-I'm sorry about this morning,     
 but that woman last night,     
 she was not me.     
 - This is me. I am me. 
- Uh-huh.     
 I'm the woman who's gonna be standing     
 in the corner next to Martha Kilgallin,     
 - desperate and sweating like a pig. 
- There are two Ls     
 - in "Kilgallin"? 
- I'm the woman who's gonna get elbowed     
 out of the way at the butcher shop so that other women     
 can get the best lamb chops. 
Other women who have husbands     
 to shop for. Nobody cares if you're ordering steak for one.     
 That-That's me. That's the real me we're dealing with.     
 And she's not fun. She's sad and embarrassed     
 and poten... What are you doing?     
 I'm making notes. This is great stuff.     
 This is not great stuff.     
 This is my life falling apart.     
 My husband left me. Do you understand that?     
 He left me, left my children. You've met my children.     
 I did. One of 'em gave me bubonic plague.     
 It was jelly, goddamn it. Children get jelly     
 - on their hands. 
- Okay. Relax.     
 The woman who showed up at that club and said those crazy things     
 was in a state.     
 A manic emotional state.     
 Bullshit. You loved it.     
 Yes! For a moment it-it was glorious, okay?     
 F-For one moment, I said and did things     
 that I've never done or said before.     
 But-but that is all a complete blur to me now.     
 I don't know how I got there.     
 I wouldn't know how to get there again.     
 And I'm not gonna try. Do you understand?     
 Yeah.     
 I understand.     
 Made me come all the way to the Upper West Side.     
 Didn't even have a doctor's appointment.     
 Wait.     
 For the bail.     
 See ya.     
 [SIGHS]     
 Not too many fatty pieces. It's all he'll eat.

 Abe! Dinner's on the table!     
 - Hello? 
- Rosie?     
 Oh, my God, Rosie, is that you?     
 Yes, it's me, Shirley.     
 Rosie, I'm beside myself.     
 I feel like a building just fell on my head.     
 A block. A whole block.     
 I feel like   th between Sixth and Seventh     
 just fell right on my head.     
 I thought dinner was on the table.     
 Calm down. You sound winded.     
 I see carrots, potatoes...     
 Oh, hey, the salad's on the table.     
 - I'm talking to Shirley. 
- Shirley?     
 - Mm. 
- Oh, great. Tell her to hang on.     
 I want to put her on speakerphone.     
 Shirley, will you hold on just one minute?     
 You're not hanging up on me, are you?     
 No, I'll be right back.     
 People think I'm such a strong person, but I'm not.     
 Hurry, before she hangs herself with the phone cord.     
 Okay. And... go.     
 Shirley, are you still there?     
 - Barely. 
- Okay, good.     
 Go ahead. You were saying?     
 I was saying my heart is broken.     
 - [QUIETLY]: Excellent. 
- What?     
 Nothing. Go ahead, Shirley.     
 I didn't get to have my Yom Kippur dinner.     
 It was ripped out from under me.     
 Just like when we went to Boca and we saw this magician     
 and he ripped a tablecloth out     
 from under a completely set table.     
 Only in my case, everything falls to the floor     
 and smashes into a million pieces.     
 Tell her to speak up a little.     
 Shirley, dear, could you speak up?     
 I look forward to that dinner all year!     
 But then I heard you all had such a terrible flu.     
 My heart stopped. I mean, the flu is very serious.     
 People die from the flu. But when Moishe told me     
 you didn't actually have the flu, I was so relieved.     
 "Thank God, I don't have to worry about that."     
 But then he said the kids split up,     
 and suddenly I just wished everybody had the flu.     
 - Split up? 
- Now what do I have?     
 No Yom Kippur.     
 No daughter-in-law.     
 No grandchildren.     
 You'll always have the grandchildren.     
 Oh, well, sure, yes, as a concept, but...     
 Shirley, when did you hear the kids were breaking up?     
 - Just now. 
- You're sure?     
 Yes. Joel came to see Moishe this afternoon and...     
 Wait, who is this? Who am I talking to?     
 That was Abe, Shirley. 
Now, try and calm down.     
 I promise you'll see the grandchildren again.     
 When? When am I gonna see them again?     
 Next Yom Kippur? What am I,   ?     
 I could be dead in an hour!     
 I hear there's a terrible flu going around.     
 No, the flu wasn't real, Shirley. The flu was an excuse.     
 Now people need an excuse not to see family?     
 What a world.     
 She didn't go to him. I told Miriam to go to him     
 - and she didn't go to him. 
- Abe, Abe...     
 - Who? 
- Uh, nothing, Shirley, I'm here.     
 I just wish we could all be together     
 just one more time.     
 One dinner.     
 I know, Shirley.     
 One dinner.     
 So we can celebrate the new year.     
 So I can see my grandchildren again.     
 So we can... be a family.     
 I hear you, Shirley. Now let me let you go.     
 I promise I will speak to Miriam and then we'll talk later.     
 I'm gonna try her now. Bye, Rose.

 Oh, damn it.

 You really think Shirley hasn't gotten to him already?     
 You're right.     
 [SIGHS]     
 It'll be fine.     
 I'll have to see him eventually.     
 I mean, we have the children.     
 We'll just... have to be adults.     
 And what are you gonna wear?     
 - Why? 
- Wear your red dress.     
 That's an evening dress.     
 It's dinner. That's evening.     
 - Mama... 
- If you have to see Joel,     
 then he has to see you, and if he has to see you,     
 he should see what he's missing.     
 That is not what this dinner's for.

- Uh-huh.     
 Can I help you with that?     
 Oh, uh, I've got it.     
 You look really beautiful tonight.     
 Well, I've got an armful of meat.     
 Yeah, that can't hurt.     
 We should probably figure out some logistics.     
 Logistics?     
 You have things here. Clothes.     
 I can pack them all up for you, if you'd like.     
 Okay... [SIGHS]     
 Can I come by and see the kids sometimes?     
 I'll take 'em out so I'm not here.     
 Of course. You're their dad.     
 They love you. We'll figure something out.     
 - We're sitting down, Shirley. 
- I know.     
 I just wanted to do one more thing...     
 You've done so much already.     
 Dinner, everyone. Move.

 Abe, I know this is your gathering,     
 but I'd like to take a moment to talk about family.     
 - Terrific. 
- I know we're going through     
 a rough, rough time, and I just want to     
 thank everyone for coming together tonight.     
 - Do you smell something burning? 
- Because by coming together     
 under these trying circumstances     
 we're showing future generations,     
 your Ethans, your Esthers, that in times of hardships,     
 self-sacrifice is often necessary.     
 Like the sacrifice I made pulling    Jews out of Germany     
 - in     . 
- ABE AND MIDGE: Here we go.     
 I got that call, I didn't know who these people were,     
 I didn't know how to do it, I just knew there were     
    Jews that wanted out of Germany,     
 and I was the man to get them out.     
 At great cost. What I paid per head.     
 - Okay, time to eat. 
- MOISHE: Anyhow,     
 the other day, sitting in temple,     
 looking at all the empty seats next to us...     
 seats we paid for as a family...     
 I was filled with great sadness.     
 [EXAGGERATED SIGH]     
 Something wrong, Abe?     
 Seats I paid for, actually.     
 You were going to pay me back...     
 Oh, so it's about money.     
 I didn't realize you were hurting.     
 I'm not hurting.     
 I'm just saying we had an agreement.      
 Well, you seem to have a nice life,      
 you've got your lovely home,      
 you've got your servant here.      
 Zelda is not a servant, she's an employee.      
 - She's family. 
- Family, too.      
 And well-paid, with vacation time.      
 She went to Holland last year.      
 - Iceland. 
- Iceland. Better than Holland.      
 In ancient times, we were the slaves.      
 - We don't own slaves. 
- I don't own her!      
 Can we all just calm down, eat some soup?      
 This is ridiculous! 
Are we really just going to      
 sit here and pretend everyone's having a nice evening?      
 We're not having a nice evening.      
 Fine, then I'll say it. The separation...      
 this ridiculous breakup... it's not going to happen.      
 This is not the place to have this conversation.      
 No one's talking to you.      
 What are you gonna do about it, Abe, hmm?      
 Going to let Miriam here just suddenly drift along      
 without a husband to protect her?      
 She's gonna do what with her life?      
 Sit around all day long eating bon-bons,      
 watching Queen For A Day.      
 - Is that what you want for her? 
- Of course not!      
 - That's what's gonna happen. 
- It's not!      
 - Is too! 
- I'm going back to school!      
 - What? 
- School?!      
 Everybody, please, just calm down, calm down.      
 All this anger and emotion is pointless.      
 The leaves said that the separation will not happen.      
 It's all going to end in peace and happiness.      
 Can I see you two in the bedroom a minute?      
 You swore to me you wouldn't see that crackpot anymore.      
 Drina's a friend, and she's very gifted.      
 She reads sediment. And you,      
 I told you to go get him back.      
 What?      
 I told you to fix your face,      
 put on a nice dress and get him back.      
 - What happened? 
- I...      
 You forgot how to fix your face?      
 - You couldn't find a dress? 
- No.      
 - Then what? 
- I don't want him here      
 if he doesn't want to be here.      
 Of course you do.      
 You want him here no matter what      
 he thinks or feels or wants.      
 - No. 
- Miriam,      
 because of you, we are stuck in this house with that man      
 and his bloviating and speeches.      
 And I have to say, if he talks about getting      
 those    Jews out of Germany one more time...      
 - Abe... 
- He brought them here      
 and stuck them in his factory.      
 They're all working there.      
 Is he paying these poor people?      
 Are there toilets for them? I've seen their faces.      
 I can't be sure of this, but one of them has a look like,      
 "I should have taken my chances back in Germany."      
 - Oh... 
- Papa.      
 He's a pompous ass! I said it.      
 Did you hear that? Is that the fridge?      
 Oh, God, she's going after the dessert.      
 - [DOOR SHUTS] 
- Shirley!      
 [ABE SIGHS]      
 Are you really going back to school?      
 No.      
 What are you gonna do?      
 I don't know.      
 What's this for?      
 I don't know.      
 [DOOR OPENS, SHUTS]      
 [INHALES DEEPLY]      
 [SNIFFING]      
 [JOEL AND MOISHE ARGUING]      
 JOEL: Where we gonna go, huh?      
 MOISHE: I don't care, the street... what do I care?      
 - Oh, God. 
- JOEL: Aw, you're bluffing.      
 MOISHE: I'm not bluffing.      
 This is not a bluff you want to call.      
 I'm doing nothing.      
 This is all you, my boy.      
 Are you crazy? It was a wedding gift.      
 What was a wedding gift?      
 A wedding gift to a married couple.      
 A gift for you and Miriam.      
 You say there's no longer a couple?      
 Fine, I'll take it back.      
 The apartment is in my name.      
 I can do what I want with it.      
 - He owns your apartment? 
- Why would you do this?      
 You say you want me out of your life.      
 Okay, I'm out of your life.      
 But I'm taking the apartment with me.      
 You're a real son of a bitch.      
 Joel. It-it's not true.      
 Tell me it's not true.      
 You going back to school, Miriam?      
 Take a business class.      
 'Cause the boy here doesn't know      
 - his ass from his elbows. 
- Hey, hey, we have neighbors.      
 He's f*ckin' lousy with numbers.      
 You guys are broke. 
You're living hand to mouth.      
 Joel buys you flowers, they're from me.      
 - Joel... 
- You own nothing.      
 Your apartment is mine, his job is his uncle's, so mine.      
 He's provided nothing, he's saved nothing.      
 Joel, please talk.      
 You didn't tell her. 
Your wife, she didn't know.      
 - Toddlers, both of you. 
- Okay, get out of my house.      
 - Uh, you mean my house. 
- I don't care whose house it is!      
 - Get out if it! 
- Let's be clear about it...      
 [ALL SHOUTING]      
 Mosh, get out of here! 
I said get out, both of you!      
 Just stop... 
Just take him out of here...      
 - SHIRLEY: The happy family. 
- Shirley...      
 WOMAN: Wichita.      
 Wichita.      
 Wichita!      
 - Excuse me, Miss. 
- Ha!      
 Clothed in mendacity, Wichita.      
 Dripping... What the... Come on.      
 Ya zhivu v bolshom dome na kholm.      
 That's Russian, m*therf*cker!      
 [AUDIENCE "OOHS"]      
 And here we go.      
 I was a Russian literature major,      
 and that line was from a book,      
 or a poem... I can't remember.      
 All I can remember is      
 Ya zhivu v bolshom dome na kholm,      
 which means, "I live in the large house on the hill."      
 That's funny.      
 That's really funny.      
 And the reason it's so funny is because      
 I used to live in the large house on the hill.      
 And now I live nowhere.      
 As of an hour ago, my address changed to "huh?"      
 - [LAUGHTER] 
- See,      
 my life completely fell apart today,      
 and here's why.      
 My father-in-law owns my house.      
 And he took it back when his son left me.      
 [AUDIENCE REACTS MILDLY]      
 Actually, that doesn't sound funny at all.      
 That sounds... awful.      
 Biblical, right?      
 Like, like it's Adam and Eve time,      
 and I marry Adam's son, Cain.      
 We get a nice little place, I think we're very happy,      
 and then one day Cain leaves me for,      
 I don't know, his brother Abel,      
 because there's only four f*ckin' people      
 on the planet at this point.      
 And then Adam... Adam takes my house      
 and tells me to do jigsaw puzzles.      
 [LAUGHTER]      
 God, how did I not know it wasn't our house?      
 How stupid am I? I mean, I never thought to ask,      
 "Hey, in case you leave me for your secretary,      
 what's the situation with our deed?"      
 It's the bras, right?      
 It's the bras.      
 And the... the girdles and the corsets,      
 all designed to cut off the circulation to your brain,      
 so you walk around on the verge of passing out,      
 and you look at your husband, and he tells you things,      
 and you just believe them.      
 Like, like when you're a little girl,      
 and people say, "The princess lived in a magic castle"      
 "for a hundred years.      
 "And then a prince climbed up the side,      
 "slayed a dragon, kissed her, woke her up,      
 and they lived happily ever after."      
 And you think... that's plausible.      
 [LAUGHTER]      
 Couple of details are fuzzy,      
 but sure, I'll buy that.      
 Later, you find out the prince's father owns the castle,      
 the prince's secretary knows shorthand,      
 and Sleeping Beauty's screwed.      
 [LAUGHTER]      
 You've heard about the shorthand girls?      
 These are girls whose skill in life      
 is not writing full sentences.      
 Meanwhile, I went to college to learn Russian.      
 And speaking of vodka, why don't they serve booze here?      
 I need a drink.      
 I need a stiff drink.      
 I need a drink so stiff 
I could blow it.      
 - Sorry, that's un-ladylike. 
- [LAUGHTER]      
 You look offended.      
 I don't mean to offend the delicate.      
 I-I used to be delicate. 
I was delightful.      
 I was a goddamn flower. 
I smelled like roses,      
 and sunshine shone out of my ass.      
 - [LOUD LAUGHTER] 
- What?      
 I said sunshine.      
 Hey, when you get home, check the name on your deed.      
 Oh, you are kidding me.      
 I know I must seem a bit angry      
 and deranged to you all right now, and I am.      
 I'll admit, I would like to repeatedly kick      
 every man in here in the balls      
 over the course of the next several hours.      
 I won't, though. I am still a lady.      
 And a lady never kicks men repeatedly in the balls      
 for longer than   ,    minutes tops.      
 Because then their girdles start to draw blood.      
 - [LAUGHTER] 
- All right, all right.      
 I told you about the language. You know the drill.      
 Officer Peluso...      
 Ladies and gentlemen, Officer Peluso!      
 He arrested me just the other night.      
 Come down from there right now or I'm coming up there.      
 Officer, sorry, I work alone.      
 Now, and apparently for the rest of my life.      
 I'm gonna count to five. One... [COUNT CONTINUES]      
 That's the end of my show, folks. Tune in next week,      
 when my grandmother steals my pearls and f*cks my boyfriend.      
 Five! Let's go, Peluso.      
 [CHEERING, WHISTLING]      
 That's my client.      
 We charge for pictures now.
