 [TAPPING ON GLASS]   
 Shh!   
 WOMAN: Who gives a toast at her own wedding?   
 I mean, who does that?   
 Who stands in the middle of a ballroom   
 after three glasses of champagne   
 on a completely empty stomach...   
 and I mean completely empty    
 because fitting into this dress    
 required no solid food for three straight weeks.    
 Who does that?    
 I do.    
 This day is perfect.    
 It's like a dream...    
 or a nightmare if you're my father.    
 "How much for the flowers?"    
 "Who eats mushroom caps?"    
 "Do the caterers have any idea    
 what the Jews just went through a few years ago?"    
 Two cakes, one for eating.    
 - We're very happy. 
- [LAUGHTER]    
 This day has been long in planning.    
 Anyone who knows me knows I plan.    
 At   I decided Russian literature would be my major.    
 At    I found my signature haircut.    
 At    I announced    
 I was going to Bryn Mawr College.    
 In Katharine Hepburn's old room.    
 From Day   I knew    
 that decision was a charmed one.    
 ♪ Did you say ♪    
 ♪ I've got a lot to learn? ♪    
 First of all, my roommate Petra was friendly and fat,    
 which was perfect. I'll have someone to eat with    
 who won't steal my boyfriend.    
 It smells so good. [GIGGLING]    
 The campus was old and elegant,    
 with ivy-covered buildings and stained glass windows    
 and...    
 Monogrammed butter pats.    
 What? [GASP] Oh.    
 This was a magical place    
 where butter was beautiful    
 and I would solve the mysteries of the universe    
 and meet brilliant women, kindred spirits    
 who would explore this brave new world with me.    
 Ooh! My God, it's burning.    
 It's supposed to. It's bleach.    
 It's awful. I hate you for this.    
 - It was your idea. 
- Never listen to me.    
 I'm nuts.    
 Why aren't you in pain?    
 I'm from Kansas.    
 I don't know what that means.    
 - How much longer? 
- Ten minutes.    
 Oh, Jiminy Crickets.    
 Where are you going? 
Where is she going?    
 I don't know.    
 Midge. Midge?    
 Midge!    
 - How much longer? 
- Nine minutes!    
 - Holy f*cking Christ balls! 
- [LAUGHTER]    
 But all of these marvelous adventures    
 were simply the preamble to my ultimate destiny.    
 I was going to meet a man...    
 a perfect man.    
 "He would be  ' " and blond,    
 and his name would be Dashiell or Stafford or...    
 Joel. Joel Maisel.    
 Best buildup since Iceman Cometh.    
 Joel Maisel was my knight in shining armor,    
 a gift from God,    
 and he thought I was brilliant.    
 He took me to galleries and poetry readings    
 and Greek dramas.    
 [WOLF WHISTLE]    
 [WOLF WHISTLE]    
 Uh, excuse me. Excuse me, Miss.    
 Thanks, toots.    
 MAN: Honey, don't go away.    
 She's going to need that.    
 [LAUGHING]    
 That was Misty Dream, ladies and gentlemen.    
 You know, she's only   ...    
 in dog years.    
 Anyway, I'll leave the jokes to our next performer.    
 He's fresh out of the Merchant Marines    
 or some patriotic sh1t like that.    
 And, uh, let's hear it for him...    
 Lenny Bruce.    
 This is the guy I wanted you to see.    
 No way he's funnier than Misty.    
 Thank you.    
 And so I was reading the paper,    
 and, uh, there was a story.    
 These kids... uh,  - and  -year-old...    
 were sniffing airplane glue to get high on.    
 These kids are responsible for turning musicians on     
 to a lot of things they never knew about, actually.     
 Then I had a fantasy of how it happened.     
 The kid is alone in his room.     
 It's Saturday.     
 The kid is played by George Macready.     
 [SNIFFING]     
 [AS GEORGE MACREADY] 
Well, let's see now.     
 I'm all alone in a room, and it's Saturday.     
 I'll make an airplane. That's what I'll do.     
 I'll make a Lancaster.     
 Good structural design.     
 I'll get the balsa wood here.     
 I'll cut it out. I'll sand it down.     
 Add a little airplane glue.     
 I'll rub it on a rag and, uh...     
 [SNIFF]     
 - Hey now. 
- [LAUGHTER]     
 I'm getting loaded.     
 MIDGE: Oh, the things Joel taught me.     
 You know what I want?     
 Please don't say a virgin.     
 I want to make you laugh     
 every day of your life.     
 Oh, great, but not now, though.     
 - No, no, not now. 
- Mm-mm.     
 I have been very lucky.     
 I have wonderful parents.     
 I've had a very comfortable life,     
 and though I knew that love would be great,     
 I had no idea it would be anything     
 that could justify what I paid for this dress.     
 What I paid for that dress. We're very happy.     
 And because it's better     
 than anything I could have imagined,     
 I thought I should get up here today     
 and tell all of you that I love this man.     
 [CLAPPING]     
 And yes, there is shrimp in the egg rolls.     
 - [GASPING] 
- [GLASS SHATTERS]     
 Miriam.     
 [MURMURING]     
 Excuse me. We have a problem.     
 Rabbi, she's kidding.     
 [ARGUING]     
 You show me in the Bible     
 where God says you can't eat shrimp.     
 Leviticus. Whatever does not have fins or scales,     
 - you shall not eat. 
- But did He say shrimp?

 Lefty, we got the rabbi.     
 Hmm? How? When?     
 We heard today. My mother fainted,     
 then called four people, then fainted again.     
 This year, on Yom Kippur,     
 Rabbi Krinsky will be breaking fast     
 - at our house. 
- You're gonna need some lamb.     
 Rabbi loves his lamb.     
 Excuse me. I'm in the middle of an order here.     
 - I'm so sorry. What were you getting? 
- Pork chops.     
 Put her pork chops on my tab.     
 Oh, I can't believe it.     
 The rabbi's been mad at us since the wedding.     
 It only took four years of apologies     
 and a dreidel signed by Sammy Davis Jr.,     
 but we finally got the b*st*rd.     
 - Disgraceful. 
- You like your free pork chops?     
 - Zip it, then.

 [PHONE RINGS]     
 - [RING] 
- Hello.     
 You tell everyone about the rabbi?     
 What am I, a braggart? 
Please. How's work?     
 I believe something got sold today.     
 - Hmm. 
- How's the brisket?     
 I'm buying it a sash and a crown.     
 Good. We'll need it.     
 I got a terrible stage time FOR TONIGHT:  :  .     
 - Yikes. 
- I bowed out of my lunch meeting     
 and got downtown as quickly as I could.     
 But that guy who runs the Gaslight...     
 Baz. You must learn his name.     
 Fine. Baz still gave me the crappiest time.     
 - He hates me. 
- Don't worry. We'll fix it.     
 He doesn't see me as a real comedian.     
 I mean, I'm not a real comedian yet,     
 but if he'd just give me a better time...     
 - We will fix it. 
-  :  .     
 No one is there at  :  .     
 They're not? Well, then we'll fix it.     
 I don't know what I'd do without you.     
 - Go on at  :  . 
- Bye.     
 So the waiter says, "Fine. I'll try it."     
 He looks at the bowl     
 and says "Where the hell is the spoon?"     
 And the customer says "Aha."     
 So he didn't bring him a spoon.     
 [LAUGHING]     
 And that's why he didn't eat the soup.     
 No spoon.     
 Well, you can't eat a soup with no spoon.     
 Oh, boy. That's a good joke there.     
 Uh-huh. Penny, can you walk Mitchell down to Al's office?     
 - Of course. 
- Al can take you through the specs.     
 Okay. Boy, I'll be laughing about that spoon for a week.     
 [LAUGHING]     
 Oi.     
 I saw Funt heading down the hall.     
 I sent him over to Al's office. He's fine.     
 You heading down to the Village tonight?     
 Midge will be here any minute.     
 Joel Maisel, king of comedy.     
 All right, all right.     
 You know, Imogene's dying to see your act.     
 I told her I don't know why.     
 I see you acting ridiculous all day long.     
 Very amusing. Can I use that?     
 Seriously, when can we come?     
 I have a cab waiting downstairs.     
 - Hi, Archie. 
- Why'd you have him wait?     
 We could have taken another cab.     
 I know, but the driver's having trouble with his marriage,     
 and I hated to send him off like that.     
 So I'll come next week?     
 Next week. Why not?     
 Bye, Archie.     
 Good night, Penny.     
 Good night.

 So many of you may have read the book     
 The Hidden Persuaders.     
 It's about Madison Avenue's marketing men     
 and how they create the public personas     
 we all learn to know and trust and vote for.     
 [LIGHT LAUGHTER]     
 Well, what if,     
 during the Civil War,     
 there was no Lincoln?     
 What if they had to create him?     
 [LAUGHTER]     
 This is a telephone conversation     
 between Abe Lincoln and his press agent     
 just before Gettysburg.     
 Hi, Abe, sweetheart. How are you, kid?     
 [LAUGHTER]     
 How's Gettysburg?     
 Sort of a drag, huh?     
 Well, Abe, you know     
 them small Pennsylvania towns...     
 you seen one, you seen them all.     
 What's the problem?     
 You're thinking of shaving it off?     
 Uh, Abe,     
 don't you see that's part of the image?     
 Right, with the shawl and the stove pipe hat     
 and the string tie.     
 You don't have the shawl?     
 [LAUGHTER]     
 Where's the shawl, Abe?     
 You left it in Washington?     
 What are you wearing, Abe?     
 A sort of cardigan?     
 Abe, don't you see that doesn't go     
 with the string tie and beard?     
 [LAUGHTER]     
 Abe, would you leave the beard on     
 - and get the shawl, huh?

 Tonight was great. I killed.     
 I had a good time, so I killed.     
 I need an audience. I feed off an audience.     
 I finished, people started to leave. Did you see that?     
 I almost left myself.     
   :  . Perfect slot.     
 Give me that slot again next time.     
 Hey. here.     
 Saw your act.

 Who's that guy?     
 She works there.     
 Heh heh. Only in the Village.     
 Taxi!     
 You got three more laughs tonight     
 than you did last time,     
 and a couple of extra, like, laughlets.     
 But what you were shaking your head for?     
 - Hmm? 
- Nothing. You were great.     
 I was great.     
 You know,     
 you don't really say hello to the audience.     
 Maybe you should write a beginning,     
 something that says who you are or something.     
 What do you think?

 Good morning, Miss Miriam.

 Oh, yes, Zelda, please.

- Mm.     
 Good morning, Ethan.     
 Good morning, Ethan.

 Yes, and a great welcome from my son.     
 - Men. 
- Thanks for taking the kids last night.     
 Were they okay?     
 We need to talk about the baby.     
 Why? What's the matter with her?     
 That forehead is not improving.     
 - What? Are you sure? 
- It's getting bigger.     
 The whole face will be out of proportion.     
 Look at the nose. It's elongating now.     
 The nose is not the problem. 
The nose you can fix.     
 But this gigantic forehead.     
 Ma, there's always bangs.     
 I'm just afraid she's not a very pretty girl.     
 - Mama, she's a baby. 
- I just want her to be happy.     
 It's easier to be happy when you're pretty.     
 [CRYING]     
 You're right. Bangs will help.     
 Mm-hmm.     
 Zelda, don't clean in here. 
It's fine just the way it is.     
 How did Joel's little show go?     
 It went very well.     
 I still don't understand this whole thing.     
 Whom is he performing for?     
 - Anyone who shows up. 
- And they pay you?     
 They pass around a basket at the end of your set,     
 and whatever's in it you get to take home.     
 If you need money, we can give you money.     
 No, we don't need money.     
 Joel is funny, and he likes to do his comedy.     
 How long are you going to be doing this,     
 running around at night,     
 taking money from strangers like a schnorrer?     
 As long as it's fun.     
 Six to nine more months left on those arms.     
 Really? I've been doing those exercises     
 with the soup cans.     
 Forget the cans. Buy a bolero.     
 How did you get in here?     
 ZELDA: I came through the other door.     
 Just because there is a door     
 does not mean you use it.     
 A door does not represent infinite possibilities.     
 Is everything ordered for next week?     
 Yes, all done. Ethan, put your coat on.     
 You have a whole apartment to clean.     
 Just leave this room the way it is.     
 I thought we'd do dinner at your place.     
 Your dining room's bigger than ours.     
 Our dining room is fine.     
 If you don't entertain, it's fine.     
 I'll call you later. Bye, Papa.     
 Clean the bathroom. Clean the bathroom.     
 - Say goodbye, Ethan.

 There you are. Are you hungry? I made curry,

 They're upstairs.

 Did you hear we're coming downtown

 We're very excited.

 Bob Newhart is doing your act.     
 - What? 
- Bob Newhart.     
 He's on "Ed Sullivan." 
He's doing your act.     
 He must have come to the club one night     
 and seen you perform,     
 and now he's on television     
 doing it just like you do.     
 Well, different because he does it faster,     
 which is better, actually,     
 but that's besides the point.     
 I'm mad. Aren't you mad?     
 Midge, relax.     
 You're not mad.     
 No.     
 Or stunned.     
 Not even mildly bemused?     
 It's his act.     
 What?     
 Are you gonna put the rest of this on a platter?     
 How is it his act? 
How do you know his act?     
 I've got his record.     
 So you stole Bob Newhart's act.     
 It's fine. Everybody does it.     
 Everybody steals his act?     
 Yes.     
 No. Not steals.     
 Borrows. It's no big deal.     
 It's not? When I found out     
 June Freedman used my meatloaf recipe,     
 I almost stabbed her in the eye with a fork.     
 Everybody in comedy steals...     
 Borrows.     
 Borrows everybody else's jokes,     
 especially at the beginning.     
 Bob Newhart probably used Henny Youngman's stuff     
 when he started.     
 - It's how it's done. 
- Oh.     
 Well, if that's how it's done.     
 It is.     
 I thought you'd written it...     
 that act.     
 I feel a little silly now.     
 Well, I did put my spin on it.     
 Yes. You slowed it down.     
 And my inflection is different.     
 Right. I'm new to this, so...     
 You'll learn.     
 I guess I will.     
 You want a drink?     
 Sure.     
 Guess I'd better go apologize to June Freedman now.

- How's the brisket?     
 - Is it okay? 
- Do you know something I don't?     
 Just answer the question, Midge.     
 Yes. It's fine. What's the matter?     
 I had to work straight through lunch,     
 so I couldn't go downtown to get a time for tonight.     
 - Tonight, you understand? 
- Tonight. Yes, I understand.     
 Archie and Imogene are coming, remember?     
 Of course I remember.     
 They're coming tonight,     
 and I don't have a time.     
 You know what? Cancel them. Tell them I'm sick.     
 They've got a babysitter. 
It's all arranged.     
 I should have changed that lunch, damn it.     
 Joel, come on. I promise you'll get on.     
 I'll bring the brisket. 
I'll do my thing.     
 Everything will be fine, okay?     
 - Okay. 
- Hey.     
 Remember this whole comedy thing,     
 it's supposed to be fun.     
 That's why we do it, right?     
 Right. Well, you'll have to bring me     
 my show sweater. I left it at home.     
 - I can do that. 
- And you have to be here right at  .

 I would have come up.     
 You get here at  , you come up.     
 Are you kidding me?     
 - What? 
- Holes.     
 - Holes everywhere. 
- What?     
 I can't believe you didn't look at it     
 before you left the house.     
 I was in a hurry to meet you. You can hardly see them.     
 Hardly see? Look, look.     
 A hole here, a hole here, two holes here.     
 I mean, how does this happen?     
 It was probably a moth.     
 - A moth? 
- Yes.     
 What moth?     
 Ted. Ted the Moth.     
 Dime-sized holes, that's his signature.

 Going on stage with holes in my shirt like a bum.     
 It's downtown. If you have underwear on, you're overdressed.     
 Hey, why don't you talk about it?     
 - About what? 
- About your sweater.     
 You know, joke about it in your act.     
 It'll be fun, personal, yours.     
 I don't know.     
 Oh, great. They're here.     
 Okay, why don't you go join them,     
 have a cup of coffee, calm down?     
 I'll go deal with this, okay?     
 Yeah, fine. Hurry.     
 Mm-hmm.     
 Excuse me. Is Baz around?     
 Nope.     
 Excuse me.     
 Um, do you see my husband Joel Maisel over there?     
 Okay. He couldn't get away from work     
 to come down here earlier for a time to perform.     
 He's a comedian.     
 Anyhow, it was a crazy day at work,     
 and, see, tonight our best friends are here...     
 - the Clearys, and... 
- Wait a minute.     
 The Clearys are here?     
 You're kidding me. Where?     
 Over there.     
 Well, I will be damned.     
 Well, that is exciting. 
The Clearys are here.     
 Wow.     
 Anyhow,     
 I was wondering if you could find a way     
 to give my husband a better time...     
 preferably before   :  .     
 Why isn't he over here?     
 - What? 
- Mr. Saturday Night.     
 Why isn't he asking for the time?     
 Why are you asking for the time?     
 Well, I have the brisket.     
 So...     
 anything you can do would be great.     
 So thanks.     
 That looks like Allen Ginsberg.     
 Imogene, doesn't that look like Allen Ginsberg?     
 Everyone here looks like Allen Ginsberg.     
 - Hey, there, kitten. 
- Hi.

 so she does, and I put it on.     
 Holes.     
 Holes in my sweater.     
 So I asked, "How did this happen?"     
 And she says "Moths."

 And she says "Ted."     
 "Ted the Moth."

 Hi, Abe, sweetheart. How's Gettys...

 I mean, if they had 
to create Abe Lincoln.     
 The book's not about that.     
 Uh... this... this bit...

 Hi, Abe, sweetheart. How's Gettysburg?

 That's, uh... That doesn't go with the string tie and b...     
 Don't you see that's part of the image?     
 Right, with the shawl and the stove     
 pipe hat and the string tie.     
 You told me to talk about my sweater.     
 I know.     
 I just thought you'd put it     
 into some sort of joke form or something.     
 Sorry.     
 Don't.     
 Can I get you anything?     
 What are you doing?     
 I have to go.     
 I have to leave.     
 You. I have to leave you.     
 That's my suitcase.     
 It is?     
 You going to leave me with my suitcase?     
 Joel, tomorrow's Yom Kippur.     
 I'm... I'm... I'm not happy.     
 Nobody's happy. It's Yom Kippur.     
 I don't know how to do this.     
 I'm not good at things like this.     
 Things like what? Like leaving me?     
 - Yes. 
- So don't. Practice a little.     
 Try it again when you feel more confident about the moves.     
 - Midge... 
- Joel, the rabbi is coming.     
 Yeah. I know he is.     
 Five years we've been trying to get the rabbi,     
 and this year we got him. We got the rabbi.     
 - I should go. 
- No. P-Please.     
 I don't understand.     
 I thought my life was going to be something different.     
 I thought I was going to be someone different,     
 but tonight was just so terrible.     
 I mean, a whole room full of people just watching me bomb.     
 It was one stupid night.     
 And I'm up there dying,     
 and I'm thinking about last week.     
 We're in temple, and the rabbi tells     
 that stupid Sodom and Gomorrah joke,     
 and suddenly the whole synagogue goes nuts.     
 - So? 
- He got more laughs in five minutes     
 than I did in five months.     
 You're jealous of the rabbi?     
 He was in Buchenwald. Throw him a bone.     
 Did you ever think you were supposed to be something,     
 and, uh, and you suddenly realize you're not?     
 Yes. Married.     
 - That's good. You're good. 
- Joel, please.     
 I'm never going to be a professional comedian, Midge. Never.     
 No, of course not.     
 What do you mean, of course not?     
 What do you mean, what do I mean?     
 What did you think all those nights at the club were?     
 I thought they were fun.     
 I thought they were our fun couples thing,     
 like how the Morgensterns play golf     
 or how the Meyers ballroom dance     
 or how the Levins pretend they're from Warsaw once a week     
 to get   % off of that Polish restaurant     
 - that does Kielbasa Night. 
- I can't believe this.     
 I never knew you were serious about it.     
 Of course I was serious, Miriam.     
 What the hell ever made you think I wasn't serious?     
 Well, for starters, you were doing someone else's act.     
 I told you, everybody does that when they start.     
 If you wanted to be a comedian,     
 you should have at least written a joke.     
 I tried with the Ted thing.     
 - I wrote the Ted thing. 
- And it bombed.     
 - Because you killed it. 
- Oh, forget it.     
 Joel, come on. You have a job.     
 Yet the comedy was a dream.     
 Do you know what a dream is?     
 A dream is what keeps you going     
 in a job you hate.     
 Since when do you hate your job?     
 Do you know what I do, Midge?     
 You're the vice president of...     
 No, no, no, no.     
 Do you know what I do every day?     
 Day in and day out,     
 what the actual physical machinations of my job are?     
 - No. 
- Neither do I!     
 I take meetings. I take phone calls.     
 I shuffle paper around,     
 and I have no idea     
 of what the hell I actually do.     
 Maybe if you did, you'd like it more.     
 I just thought,     
 with the brisket and the notebook,     
 I thought you understood.     
 I'm sorry.     
 Yeah. Me, too.     
 But, Joel, you can't just leave.     
 I love you.     
 We have a home. We have children.     
 - They're going to notice. 
- I have to go.     
 No, no, no. Wait. I will be better.     
 I will do better. I... I'll... I'll pay more attention.     
 You can quit your job.     
 We can go to the club every single night,     
 and I'll buy more notebooks.     
 I've been having an affair.     
 It's been going on for months.     
 I thought it was a phase, but now...     
 Who?     
 Penny.     
 Your secretary.     
 You're leaving me for a girl     
 who can't figure out how to sharpen pencils?     
 It's not about her, and it was a new sharpener.     
 It was electric. 
All she had to do was push.     
 Don't you understand? 
I need to start over.     
 With her? She wins?     
 It's not a contest.     
 I just don't want this life,     
 this whole upper West Side,     
 classic six, best seats in temple.     
 Wife, two kids.     
 I just don't...     
 want it.     
 So you'll tell your parents for me?     
 Oh, that might be the funniest thing you've ever said.     
 - Honey... 
- Tomorrow is Yom Kippur.     
 I have    people and a rabbi     
 coming over for break fast,     
 and this is the moment you decide     
 to tell me you're going to ride off into the sunset

 Can I just say     
 that you have the worst timing ever?

 When you first came home with him.      
 That night. I looked at you.      
 I asked, "Is this the choice?"      
 And you said yes.      
 That was telling me?      
 I have to spell it out for you?      
 Joel's sick. Everything's fine.      
 Not a word of this to the rabbi.      
 I'm going to take a bath.      
 You listen to me, Miriam.      
 You are a child. 
You cannot survive this.      
 Now, I am no fan of Joel's, but you need a husband.      
 And those children need a father.      
 What am I supposed to do, go buy one at Zaybar's?      
 You fix your face. 
Put on his favorite dress.      
 Then you go out, find him, and make him come back home.      
 [THUNDER RUMBLES]      
 Mrs. Maisel, you all right?      
 - Do you need a cab? 
- Nope.      
 Gonna take the subway.      
 It's miserable out here.      
 It's miserable in there, too.      
 MAN: See, the eternal war is here.      
 O victory, forget your underwear.      
 We're free.      
 I'm...      
 I left my Pyrex here. I'd like it back.      
 - Your what? 
- Pyrex. My Pyrex.      
 - Nope. 
- It's a Pyrex.      
 - Yeah, you keep saying that. 
- Pyrex.      
 It's a glass baking dish, very durable.      
 It can go from hot to cold without cracking.      
 We don't serve food here.      
 I know. It's not yours.      
 It's mine. I brought it here.      
 - Why? 
- I made a brisket f...      
 Is that really important right now?      
 My dish is here. I'd like it back.      
 Can you make that happen?      
 [SIGH] This place gets so weird late.      
 - [APPLAUSE] 
- EMCEE: That was deep,      
 Christian, I think. Who knows?      
 Okay, next up. Uh...      
 folks, just sit tight. I'll be right back.      
 Bonnie, where's my set list?      
 [CHATTER]      
 So this is it, huh?      
 This is the dream... standing up here      
 on this filthy, sticky stage all alone.      
 Couldn't have that, you didn't want me.      
 Was that it, Joel?      
 WOMAN: Who's Joel?      
 What?      
 Who's Joel?      
 My husband.      
 MAN: we can't hear you.      
 WOMAN: Oh. Shh, shh, shh.      
 Sorry.      
 Joel is my husband of four years,      
 and tonight he left.      
 MAN: Whoo!      
 Thank you. Thank you very much.      
 Yep. He left... Joel.      
 Left. He packed up my suitcase and left.      
 Oh, I'm going to have to lie to the rabbi      
 about why Joel's not there.      
 Lying to the rabbi on Yom Kippur.      
 I couldn't get a clean slate for one f*cking day.      
 I don't understand what's going on.      
 Me, either, sister, me, either.      
 There are so many questions spinning around in my head.      
 Why did he leave?      
 Why wasn't I enough?      
 And why didn't they put the stage over there      
 against that wall instead of over here by the bathroom      
 so you wouldn't have to listen to every giant bowel movement      
 that takes place in there?      
 [LAUGHTER]      
 Oh, yeah. Clear as a bell.      
 I'm sorry. I'm a little drunk.      
 - It's all gone. 
- [TOILET FLUSHES]      
 Everything I've counted on is gone.      
 You feeling better now?      
 [LAUGHTER]      
 So my life completely fell apart today.      
 Did I mention that my husband left me?      
 - MAN: Whoo-hoo! 
- [LAUGHTER]      
 All right. All right. But did I mention      
 that he left me for his secretary?      
 - [WOLF WHISTLES] 
- Mm-hmm.      
 She's    and dumb as a Brillo pad.      
 And I'm not naive. I know that men like stupid girls.      
 - Right? 
- Uh...      
 But I thought Joel wanted more than stupid.      
 I thought he wanted spontaneity and wit.      
 I thought he wanted to be challenged.      
 - You know what I mean? 
- Uh...      
 You two are going to be together forever.      
 - [LAUGHTER] 
- I'll tell you this much.      
 I was a great wife.      
 I was fun. I planned theme nights.      
 I dressed in costumes. 
I gave him kids...      
 a boy and a girl.      
 And yes, our little girl is looking      
 more and more like Winston Churchill      
 every day, you know, with that big Yalta head.      
 But that's not a reason to leave, right?      
 Really? Really? After what I just said about the bathroom?      
 - [LAUGHTER] 
- Walk of shame.      
 Walk of shame!      
 I loved him.      
 And I showed him I loved him.      
 - Whoo! 
- [WHISTLES]      
 All that sh1t they say      
 about Jewish girls in the bedroom?      
 Not true. There are French whores      
 standing around the Marais District      
 saying [FRENCH ACCENT] "Did you hear what Midge did      
 to Joel's balls the other night?"      
 [LAUGHTER]      
 I can't believe this is happening.      
 I can't believe I'm losing him to Penny Pan.      
 That's her name. Terrible, right?      
 Penny Pan. Penny Pan.      
 Penny Pan.      
 And I'm officially losing my mind,      
 which is perfect.      
 Now I will be alone and crazy,      
 the famous mad divorcé of the upper West Side.      
 Upper West Side? Really? Where?      
   nd and Amsterdam.      
 That place on the corner      
 - with the courtyard? 
- That's the one.      
 Oh, that's nice. We looked there.      
 But the closets were so small,      
 and I wanted a powder room.      
 Do you know I've seen her twice      
 with her shirt on inside out?      
 Penny. Twice.      
 Once, fine. You were 
rushed in the morning.      
 Twice, you can only be trusted      
 to butter people's corn 
at the county fair.      
 - [LAUGHTER] 
- And here's the worst thing.      
 And I know this is shallow and petty and small,      
 but she's not even that pretty.      
 MAN: Huh.      
 Her ankles and her calves      
 are the same width.      
 And I'm sorry, but look at me.      
 I am the same size now that I was at my wedding.      
 And come on, who wouldn't want to come home      
 to this every night?      
 Okay. All right.      
 Maybe today's not the best day to judge.      
 I've been crying, and my face is all puffy,      
 and just... just...      
 Ignore my head. Now, from here down,      
 who wouldn't want to come home to this?      
 Actually, I'm a little bloated right now.      
 I drank a lot of wine, and my stomach is sort of...      
 Oh, can... can I borrow that?      
 Thank you.      
 Okay. Ignore this, ignore this.      
 But imagine coming home to these every night.      
 Whoo!      
 Yeah.      
 Yeah, they're pretty good, right?      
 Plus they're standing up on their own.      
 [GASPING]      
 - sh1t. 
- Seriously,      
 there's no f*cking way      
 that Penny Pan can compete with these tits!      
 So what if you're never going to be a stand-up comedian.      
 Look at what greets you at the door.      
 - sh1t. 
- Get down from there right now.      
 You think Bob Newhart's got a set of these at home?      
 Rickles, maybe.      
 - [AUDIENCE SHOUTS] 
- Aah! Hey!      
 Let's go.      
 [AUDIENCE CHEERING]      
 - Hey, f*ck Penny Pan! 
- Bravo!      
 This is not what you think.      
 She's a housewife. 
She doesn't know the rules.      
 Yeah, yeah. We can discuss it at the station.      
 - Station? What station? 
- Come on.      
 Come back next week!      
 I don't understand what's going on.      
 You're under arrest.      
 - What? Why? 
- Public indecency      
 and performing without 
a cabaret license.      
 You need a license to do that? Seriously?      
 Yeah, yeah. You can bitch all about it      
 to your friend in the back seat there.      
 - Go ahead. 
- Get in there.      
 Hey! Hey! Hey!      
 Hey.      
 Hi.      
 Here you go.      
 Thanks, Judy.      
 You bailed me out?      
 My good deed for the year.      
 You get chick raped?      
 I don't think so.      
 - Here. 
- It's still night out.      
 Yep.      
 I feel different.      
 You were in there for    minutes.      
    minutes can change you.      
 - Not really. 
- I'm a con now.      
 - Not quite. 
- I've got a rap sheet.      
 - No, you don't. 
- I'm hard.      
 I'm a hard, used woman. 
Is my hair gray?      
 - No, it's not. 
- It feels gray.      
 Jesus Christ.      
 I had it all.      
 I had everything I'd always wanted,      
 and now it's all falling apart.      
 Okay. Come on.

 Yes, they are.

 Oh, God, I'm so tired.      
 I don't think I've ever been so tired.      
 Have some nuts.      
 Do you notice I'm not wearing my own shoes?      
 I'm not. Don't know what happened, either.      
 Now I'm just a single, gray-haired ex-con      
 drinking hooch and eating old nuts      
 in someone else's shoes.      
 Listen, if you're still upset about your husband,      
 don't be. The guy was a fraud and a loser.      
 - You don't know him. 
- I know he was doing Bob Newhart's act.      
 Everybody steals, right?      
 You didn't.      
 I didn't what?      
 House party tonight.      
 Steal. You didn't steal.      
 Your sh1t was totally original.      
 Don't get me wrong. It was rough,      
 but I'm telling you, there is definitely something there.      
 I'm thinking maybe we can meet somewhere,      
 bigger club, if I could just get Baz to die.      
 - What are you talking about? 
- About your act.      
 I don't have an act.      
 You will when we're done.      
 I don't understand.      
 You should do standup, and I can help you.      
 - Oh, come on. 
- I'm serious.      
 - I am a mother. 
- Great. We'll use that.

 Tonight was an isolated incident.      
 There are medications I can take

 Look,    years      
 I've been working in clubs, okay?      
    years watching every kind of loser      
 get up there thinking he's Jack Benny.      
 Twice have I seen someone deliver the goods.      
 First time, guy walks in...      
 West Coast, suntanned, arrogant pain in the ass.      
 Three words into his act, I f*cking knew it.      
 I turned to Baz, and I said, "That guy's gonna be famous."      
 - Who was he? 
- Mort Sahl.      
 Oh, he's good. We saw him at Grossinger's last year.      
 Yeah, well, the second time was tonight.      
 Stop it.      
 I know I'm right about this,      
 just like I know that unless I somehow get rich enough      
 to hire some German broad to walk me around the park      
 twice a day in my old age,      
 I'm gonna spend my entire life alone.      
 That's not true.      
 It's fine. I don't mind being alone.      
 I just do not want to be insignificant.      
 Do you?      
 Don't you want to do something no one else can do?      
 Be remembered as something other than a mother      
 or a housewife or member of the Communist Party?      
 When did I become a member of the Communist Party?      
 The minute you took that flyer.

 Oh, no.
