 Previously on Bates Motel...  
 You're gonna raid Nick Ford's warehouse? 
 That's right. 
 Are you with me or not? 
 I'm not. 
 [Gunshot] 
 [Gunfire, muffled shouts] 
 Did you know Norman is having blackouts? 
 That girl, Cody Brennen, told me. 
 She said that Norman has blacked out twice when he's been with her. 
 Your mom warned me not to talk about your blackouts. 
 She said something happens to you in them. 
 Don't lie again! 
 You told her something happens to me when I black out. 
 You said I change, that I'm not myself. 
 Who am I, mother? 
 Who am I, and what do I do? 
 I'm not gonna answer your question, and I don't want you to ever ask me again. 
 I logged Norman Bates' DNA into our system. 
 The semen sample in Blaire Watson matched Norman Bates. 
 [Exhales deeply] 
 Norman? 
 [Knocks on door] 
 Norman? 
 [Radio plays indistinctly] 
 Norman? 
 [Ball tapping] 
 [Door closes] 
 [Radio plays indistinctly] 
 Morning. 
 Coffee's fresh. 
 Yeah, I know. I was counting on it. 
 [Radio continues in background] 
 Is there something the matter? 
 Out of cream. 
 Oh, sorry. 
 I can run up to the house and get some. 
 No, it's fine. I'll drink it black. 
 Bye, Sheriff. 
 Good morning. 
 Look what I brought you. 
 Oh, yeah, I already ate. Thanks. 
 Guess what we're doing tonight? 
 Hmm? 
 Double Indemnity is playing at the Vista. 
 Oh, really? 
 Yeah. 
 I thought you and I could go together, mother-son date. 
 Yeah, ah, I'd like to, even though we've seen it about a hundred times, but... 
 Oh, since you're here, I'm gonna go back up to the house. 
 Got to finish that owl I've been working on, huh? 
 Norman, it's not... [Sighs] 
 It's not my fault. 
 It's not me. It's just the situation. 
 Oh, you mean the situation where you don't tell me the secrets you know about me? 
 Norman. 
 No, I've accepted it. 
 It's... it's fine. 
 Hello, Norma. 
 Hi, Nick. 
 Well, what brings you here? 
 I'd like you to do me a favor. 
 Hmm? 
 And I prefer asking in person. 
 I'm old-fashioned that way. 
 That's nice. 
 You have a son, Dylan Massett? 
 Yes. 
 He works for Morgan family? 
 Well, I-I don't exactly know. 
 He does. 
 I'd like for you to arrange a meeting between us. 
 Us? 
 Your son and myself. 
 Why? 
 There's some things we need to discuss. 
 Like what? 
 [Sighs] That's between him and me. 
 You and my son, Dylan? 
 Yes. 
 We're in the same business. 
 Don't you talk to your son about anything? 
 [Sighs] 
 Not so much about work. 
 I don't like what he does. 
 I'm not asking you to get your hands dirty. 
 All you need to do is tell him that we need to meet. 
 We don't really talk. We had a falling out. 
 If for no other reason, you need to see him and fix that. 
 I lost a daughter. 
 I was estranged from her when it happened. 
 I can tell you, it's the most horrible thing that ever happened to me. 
 Talk to your son. 
 Do it while you can. 
 Do it right away. 
 [Suspenseful music] 
 [Crackling electricity] 
 [Sirens whoops]

 He was running the shift.

♪ Electric Avenue ♪ Jodi! What's going on? Your brother's out of his mind. He raided the Ford warehouse last night. I tried to stop them. Oh, my God. [Dialing] [Line trilling] Hey, it's Dylan. Leave a message. [Beep] Hi, Norma. How much do you know about this town? A lot, I guess. Like what? Do you know where Dylan works? I need to talk to him. Uh, do you know what Dylan does? I know that he works for one of these marijuana companies. I'll go with you. I can show you where it is. Huh, what do you know, huh? You're never down at the dry dock. You know, Uncle Gil, he worked for dad for 25 years, and they just walked into his house, and they killed him. How would you have handled it? Well, what I wouldn't have done is start an all-out war. Well, that's because you don't have a clue, Jodi. You just sit up here all day long and play with your stupid little plants. Look, I get that you resented that dad gave me the business, but do not go destroying how we all make a living because you need to prove yourself. All right, you begged me to come home and help you. I-I begged you? This isn't gonna help right now. Okay, no offense, but how you two feel about each other is pretty irrelevant. What we need to do is figure out what the hell we're gonna do. I got a plan, if you would just shut up long enough to listen. Oh, yeah, what's that? Hire Han Solo to crash the Millennium Falcon  into the Ford warehouse? Nick Ford's old, right? We offer him a buyout. If he says no, we tell him he's gonna get more of the same. We wear him down. We wear him down until he says yes. Then we take over the damn town. That's your plan? Mm-hmm. Look. Right now, right this minute, there's a bunch of pissed off people who are gonna be gunning for your head, Zane. The thing you need to do is lay low somewhere. You know where to go. [Scoffs] You're gonna see. [Door closes] I don't know if it's a good idea to go in there unannounced. Well, he won't answer my calls. I have no choice. Be careful. [Knocks on door] What do you want? [Gasps] Uh, I'm just here to see my son, Dylan Massett. [Chuckles] Oh, sh1t. Didn't recognize you. [Foghat's Slow Ride plays] It's down this way here. Where are you taking me? To his office. Dylan has an office? [Chuckles] Yeah. [Rock music continues] ♪ the rhythm is right ♪ [knocking] ♪ move to the music ♪ [knock on door] Yeah, come in. Your mom is here. What are you doing here? I, uh, I came to see you. About? Um, about this man, Nick Ford. What the hell do you have to do with Nick Ford? Well, nothing really, except that I met him at a party, and he started helping me figure out how to stop the bypass, and now he wants a favor from me. What favor? He... he wants to meet with you. Is this really your office? Yeah. It's nice, Dylan. I mean, I don't like the marijuana part, but I'm glad you're doing so well. Why does he want to meet with me? I don't know. He didn't tell me. He said it was important, though. He probably wants to meet me so he can put a bullet through my head. What do you mean? He's in charge of the rival drug family. Some bad sh1t went down between us. There's no way I can meet with him. Tell him you couldn't find me, okay? And don't have anything more to do with him. He's dangerous. Well, I don't want you to get hurt. I don't ever want you to get hurt. You better go, Norma. Are you around weed all the time? You know, cannabinoids can actually get absorbed into all sorts of different parts in your body. I'm not rolling around in it. Well, still, I mean, did you do anything to protect yourself? Norma. I'm still your mother. You can't be here, okay? You gotta go. There's lots of stuff we haven't talked about. I can't. You need to go now. You walk her out? Yeah. Bye, Dylan. Hey. Did you hear the news? What news? The bypass temporarily halted for environmental studies. Really? Yeah. [Gasps] I can't believe it! Norma, I've gotta say something. It's great being your friend, but it's not enough for me. I need to know if you're interested in this being anything else, so I can stop making an idiot out of myself. Okay. Okay, yes? Okay, no? [Chuckles] I'm not sure what I'm agreeing to. A date. Tomorrow night, my place for dinner. Say 7:00. Okay. Okay. [Both chuckle] [Car door opens] We're sitting on the dry dock, Jodi Morgan's house, and the apartment he's renting. Zane hasn't been near any of them, so should we just... Yeah, work harder. Get information out of people. Don't be nice about it, and don't bother me or make excuses until you find him. You got all that? Yes, sir. [Rock music] [siren wailing] Get out. Look, I thought... Get out. Where the hell is Zane Morgan? I don't know, man. I don't know where he is. Look, I'd tell you if I knew! You think I wanted any of this to happen? You hear anything, you need to tell me. And if I find out you're lying to me, you're gonna be dead, you understand? You understand? Yeah, okay. Okay. Go. Get out of here. [Engine turns] What are you doing? I thought you'd like some of my work in the house. I know how much you like it. Isn't this lovely? Look, feel it. So soft, just like it's real. It is soft. What? Just not really sure they go. Well, sure they go. That's the great thing about taxidermy. It goes with everything. It's nature. Norman, you wouldn't be doing this because you're mad at me, would you? I have no reason to be mad at you. I love my work, and I'm sharing it with you because I love you. Okay. Enjoy. Thank you. [Knocks on door] Oh, hey. The rod that holds up the shower curtain just broke out of the wall. Oh, dear. Well, maybe Norman can hold it up for me while I fix it. Okay. So how did you... How did you break the curtain rod, Sheriff? Well, one of those rings was stuck in here, and I just... I jiggled it a little too hard. I'm almost done here. Oh. Oopsy-daisy, I got it. Thanks. Hey, how... How well did you know, um, Blaire Watson? Uh, well, she was my teacher, so... Yeah, but I mean, did you know anything else about her? Not really. She seem stable to you? Mostly, yes. Mostly? Most... [laughs] No, I didn't mean that. She was very professional. You know, a good teacher, a good counselor. She... But why mostly? Oh, well, she just... She seemed a little... Sad and lost, I guess, at times. You ever see her outside of school? Mm-mm. No. Uh-uh. You told me before that you did. But for a school project, so it's not... Look, there's no way to put this delicately. She slept with a lot of people, Norman. A lot of those people were not nice. Why are you telling me this? Because I'm wondering, did you ever sleep with her? No. No, I never slept with her. Norman, you can tell me. In fact, you have to tell... No, I didn't do anything. She was... she was a nice person. She was just looking after me. That's all. You're not doing yourself any good here. Why are you asking me this? Norman. Norman. This isn't just gonna go away. Norman! I don't know what you're talking about. 
 
 [Loud knocking at door] I'm Nick Ford. I need to see your mother. She's in town right now, but she should be back shortly. You mind if I wait inside? It's important. Okay. You can... You can sit over there. You were the one taking pictures of me at my daughter's grave. Ms. Watson was your daughter? Yeah. Why were you taking pictures of me? Because she was my teacher, and I was very upset about her death. You see, I heard her having an argument, you know, the day before it happened with someone named Eric and thought that you might be him, you know. Maybe this Eric person was the one who killed her, so I... No. No, Eric was my business manager. I thought if I cut her off, she'd come back. She and I'd had a falling out six months earlier. I was trying to get her to come home. I'm sorry. Looks like you and your mother are very close. Yeah. Yes, we are. We always have been, anyway. There's nothing more important. [Door opens] [Door closes] Hi, mom. Nick Ford, he just came by to see you. Uh, go put this in the kitchen, please. It's okay, just put the stuff away. I-I couldn't find Dylan. He won't talk to me. I thought I told you... And I told you I can't find him. Norma, you're not being smart here. How dare you? How dare you give me orders, come into my house when I'm not here, act like somehow I'm beholden to you? That's because you are. You're just too ignorant to realize it. Who do you think got you that seat on the City Council? And what do you think happened to Lee Berman? You are beholden to me. [Breathing heavily] No, I don't believe you. You're just saying this to make me do something that I'm not going to do. I don't want him talking to you. I don't like you, I don't trust you. And I want you out of my house now. Do I need to call Sheriff Romero? He's a personal friend of mine. You're making a horrible mistake. [Outside door closes] [Exhales] [cellar door opens] Norman? [Approaching footsteps] Norman. What? I heard you. Okay, but you didn't answer. [Sighs] I'm gonna meet someone for dinner. Okay. Norman. What? Norman, enough. I know you're upset at me, but it's not my fault. You have to trust me on this. No, I'm fine. Okay. I'm meeting George for dinner. He seems nice. Have fun. Well, I don't know how long I'm gonna be. I'll probably be very late. I won't wait up. [Stomping footsteps] [Line trills] Hello? I heard you want to talk to me. I do. Can you come by my house later? No. No, I can meet you someplace public. That way I know you can't shoot me, and I can't be spotted with you, so it's gonna have to be someplace outside of White Pine Bay. There's a pizza place in Downtown Oceanview. I'll meet you there at 8:00 P.M. I'll see you then. [Slow, romantic music] Hi. Hi. You look beautiful. I just put dinner on. Hope you like steak. Who doesn't? Come on in. I learned how to really grill a steak in Austin when I worked on a ranch one summer. Really, what'd you do? I was a ranch hand. Been at Brown for two years and just got a little fed up with the lifestyle of the privileged. So I applied for a job that I didn't know how to do, and I faked it. Got thrown off a horse. [Chuckles] You okay? Yeah. What's Brown? That's a university back east. Oh, right. Yeah, yeah. Where'd you go again? Florida. Wait, didn't you say you went to Arizona state? Did you transfer? I think this was a mistake. What do you mean this was a mistake? Norma, dinner's ready. Look, I'm not who you think I am. What are you talking about? I didn't transfer. I didn't even go to college. I lied about it. I barely finished high school. My husband didn't own an insurance company, and my family was a mess. I'm not educated or polished or nice. I'm nothin'. I don't have dinners with men like you in houses like this, and no one cooks me filet mignon. I got to go. What about dinner? I know. I'm sorry. [Cries] Norman... Okay. Here I am. Talk. For future reference, Dylan, in business, as in life in general, pleasantries are an important part of how people communicate. It helps us to find common ground, but I sense you're not comfortable being here, maybe even a little out of your depth. So we'll skip past that part today and get right to our mutual problem. What's that? Zane Morgan. What about him? You can find him. You can get to him, and you can take him out. You do that, and this all stops right here. You're asking me to kill Zane. I'm not asking you. You need to do it. You don't start a drug war unless you're prepared for a slaughter down to the last man standing. Are you prepared for that? Is your family? 'Cause that's what's going to rain down on you. We're done talking. And stay the hell away from my mother... Or I will kill you. [Knocks on door] [Closes door] What are you doing? Jury just came back. Kyle Miller's been convicted of the murder of Blaire Watson. I thought you might like to know. Uh-huh. So what does that mean? What do we do? What do we do about what? About Norman Bates, and the fact that his semen sample matched, that he had s*x with her the night that she was killed, and nobody but us knows about this. Okay, well, you know, here's something we could do. We could prosecute Blaire Watson for having s*x with a minor. Oh, no. sh1t, she's dead. You, uh... You tell anyone, and I'll hang you from the highest tree for illegally running a sample through the criminal database. I gotta go. Thanks for the news. [Door closes] Doesn't have to be a crown block. It could be a car backing over him or he could fall out the upstairs window. Any little thing like that, just so it's a morgue job. Are you crazy? Not that crazy. Good-bye, Mrs. Dietrichson. What's the matter? Look, baby. You can't get away with it. You want to knock him off, don't you? That's a horrible thing to say. What'd you think I was, anyway? The guy that walks into a good-looking dame's front parlor and says, "good afternoon, I sell accident insurance on husbands." Norman, we need to talk. George not feeling well? Um... [Movie continues playing] I missed you. That's sort of silly. We just saw each other. Norman, stop it. Stop what? I know what you're doing. I'm watching a movie. Yeah, the movie that you said you'd seen a hundred times that I wanted to go to with you. Well, we have seen it a hundred times. I still enjoy it. Sometimes it's just nice to watch a movie alone, you know? You're being a dick about something that isn't my fault. I'm just watching a movie. Movie's over. That was childish. Norman, stop it. Stop. I don't like you this way. And what way is that? All distant, like you couldn't be bothered with me. You mean like I'm my own person? Like we're different? Like I have secrets from you? Don't you walk away from me! You're being ridiculous. Am I? Norman, please. Oh, I see. The anger didn't work. Now the tears. Norman, you don't understand! No, I do understand! I understand that you're not who I thought you were. That we're not what I thought we were. Yes, we are. Nothing has changed. Everything has changed. You changed the rules. What rules? What are you talking about? I don't trust you anymore, and that changes everything. Okay, it's all up for grabs now. You no longer know who I am either, because we're different. What? Stop it. Stop. Stop it, Norman. It was all just a game. The game was that we were devoted to each other, and no one could ever come between us, that we loved each other more than anyone could ever love another person. But we do love each other. Do we? Do we really, mother? I'm going to my room. Don't follow me. Leave me alone. You stay out here alone. [Whimpering] Norman! [Door slams, locks] Norman, unlock the door. [Knob rattling] [Second door locks] I have the key, mother. Norman. [Knob rattling] Norman! I won't stay out here! You want to be alone? Fine, be alone. [Slams door] [Knocks on door] Norma, what are you doing? You came back. Yeah, I came back. I've wanted to do this for a long time. Then do it. Dylan Massett is here. It's okay. Send him in. Hi. You want wine? You got a beer? Yeah, help yourself. So, what's going on? Zane's plan is insane. Nick Ford's not gonna sell his business and move to Hawaii. All right, if we don't figure out how to stop this, he's gonna slaughter everybody who's ever worked for us. And you know this how? From your vast experience here in White Pine Bay? From common sense. You can't ignore this and just hope that it's gonna go away. I'm not ignoring anything. What are you gonna do? He's totally out of his mind. All right, you have to stop him. You're the only one that has the power to do it. My life's at stake here too. You can leave now. You aren't walking away from this. I don't know what I'm supposed to do. If you need to do something about Zane, you can do it. [Thunder rolls] Norman. Kyle Miller just got convicted for the murder of Blaire Watson. So I gotta know something. Why are you lying to me? I didn't... I didn't lie to you. You did. I know you had s*x with Blaire Watson the night she was murdered. But I didn't. I don't know why... Stop, stop. I have evidence. I have physical proof. We ran tests on you after the incident with Cody's dad. Your DNA matches one of the semen samples in Blaire Watson from that night. No, that's impossible, because I... Maybe you don't want your mother to know, and I understand that, but I have to know what happened that night, Norman. I have to know why you're lying. I have to know I didn't just convict an innocent man, and if you don't cooperate with me, I am gonna have to go to your mother, and tell her everything, because I need to know the truth, Norman. Norman! [Distant creaking] Mother? Mother? Mother? [Grunting]
