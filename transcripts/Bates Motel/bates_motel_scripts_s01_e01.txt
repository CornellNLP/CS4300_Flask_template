 Mom? 
 [Steam hissing] 
 [Liquid bubbling] 
 Dad? 
 Mom! 
 Mom? 
 Mom! Mom, open the door! 
 [Pounding on door] 
 Mom! 
 What is it, Norman? 
 It's dad. He's--hurry! 
 [Whimpering] 
 Dad? Dad? Dad? 
 Dad... 
 Norman... 
 [Cries] 
 Norman? 
 [Cries] 
 Norman. 
 Oh, honey. I'm so sorry. 
 Dad. 
 This is the part where you say, "Mother, this is beautiful. 
 "I am so happy we're moving here. 
 You are so smart to have thought of this." 
 Mother, this is so beautiful. 
 I'm so happy you're making me move here. 
 You're so smart to force me to do things I have no say in. 
 You're an ass. 
 [Laughs] 
 Okay, no peeking! 
 Keep 'em closed. 
 Okay. Okay, not yet. 
 [Breathes deeply] 
 Open your eyes. 
 What do you think? 
 [Laughs] This is crazy, mom. 
 It's not crazy. It's not. 
 We're gonna run this place. Mm-hmm. 
 [Laughs] 
 Yeah. 
 We own a motel, Norman Bates. 
 Come on. I wanna show you the house. 
 I bought the whole thing, the house and the motel, on a foreclosure. 
 And everything came with it. 
 Awesome. 
 You can't buy furniture like this anymore. 
 You have to imagine this room without all this crap in it. 
 Just simple, elegant furnishings, open space, light. 
 Linen drapes, fresh peonies. 
 This space is beautiful. 
 Come on. I want to show you upstairs. 
 What's up here? My room? 
 No, I put you down here, closer to me. 
 This...is your room. 
 And this... is my room. 
 Norman, we've been through a lot. 
 This is our chance to start over. 
 Maybe some people don't get to start over. 
 Maybe they just bring themselves to a new place. 
 They do get to start over, but they have to try. 
 Yeah? Norman, please, for me. 
 It's all gonna be good. You'll see.

 You're new. What's your name? 
 Norman Bates. 
 When did you move here, Norman Bates? 
 Last night. 
 Where? What house? 
 Oh, here. The house at the motel. 
 Oh, so you bought the motel? 
 Are you actually gonna live here, or are you just flipping the property? 
 We're not flipping. 
 Do you have any brothers? 
 An older brother. But he doesn't live here. 
 Just me and my mom. 
 You have a girlfriend?

 You have any questions at school, you call me. 
 Okay? 
 Thanks. 
 [Phone chiming] 
 Hello, Dylan. 
 Thanks for letting me know you moved, mom. 
 Well, I'm pretty sure the last time we spoke, you told me to "drop dead, bitch." 
 Sorry I took it personally. 
 [Scoffs] 
 What, so you thought that it was okay not to tell your own son that you moved? 
 What if I was hurt? What if I was in the hospital? 
 What if I needed you? 
 Are you hurt? Are you in a hospital? 
 I need some money. My job fell apart. 
 Hello? Norma? Hello? 
 So I want you to just think about poetry tonight. 
 I mean, what does it mean? Why is it timeless? 
 Why is there power in words arranged in cadences and structures? 
 [School bell rings] 
Be ready to talk tomorrow. 
 Norman, can I talk to you for a minute? 
 Sure. 
 I'm gonna be your advisor here, and I was just reviewing your school records and, um... 
 Your test scores are... 
[Laughs] really impressive. 
 But your grades just don't match up with them. 
 That's a shame. 
 Why do you think that is, Norman? 
 We move a lot. 
 Mm-hmm, yeah, I see that. 
 You've been to five different schools. 
 Is everything okay at home? 
 Yeah, yeah. 
 My mom's just a little... impulsive. 
 She gets these ideas about things, and--and then we move and start over... which is good. 
 Mm. 
 You know, I think it might be a good idea, now that you're here, to try to put down some roots. 
 You know, get involved, maybe join a sports team? 
 I don't really play any sports. 
 My mom never really liked them. 
 Hmm. What about track? 
 You look like a runner. 
 You ever do any running? 
 Not as a sport, no. 
 Well, track team tryouts are today. 
 Why don't you go talk to coach carpenter after school? 
 I'll--I'll tell him that you're coming down. 
 Okay. 
 Norman, I... 
 I see that you lost your dad recently. 
 I know how hard that must be. 
 So please know that you can come to me if you have any issues or questions about anything, because I'm here for you. Okay? 
 I have to go now. 
 Wow. Dinner smells great, mom. 
 I've been-- 
I've been waiting for you. 
 I stayed after school to try out for the track team. 
 Oh, the track team? 
 Yeah, well, it was Miss Watson's idea, I... 
 Who's Miss Watson? 
 My language arts teacher. 
 But yeah, she thought it'd be a good idea for me to get involved at school. 
 That it'd be good for me. 
 I need you to sign this parent's permission slip, though. 
 Honey, this is, like, every day after school, and track meets on Saturdays? 
 We just bought a motel. 
 I mean, how do you expect me to get it up and running without your help? 
 I mean, you're putting me in a tough spot here. 
 Mom, it's okay. I don't have to do it. 
 No, I'm not gonna be the mother who tells her kid he can't be on the track team. 
 It's fine. It's okay. 
 I'll just do everything myself, the way I always do. 
 Mom, come on, sit down. Let's eat dinner. 
 You know, Norman, I just spent all day... doing all of this. 
 You know, I just-- 
 [sighs] 
Never mind, I'm not hungry. 
 It's fine. 
[Pen scribbling] 
 You know, it doesn't matter. 
 I have to get some groceries. Just eat your dinner. 
 Mother! 
 Norman Bates? 
 Yes. 
 Just moved in a couple of nights ago. 
 How do you like it? 
 Yeah, it's fine so far. 
 You live here with your mom? 
 Yeah. Yeah, do you know her? 
 I know-- 
I know about her. 
 Do you want me to get her? 
 You're 17. 
 You're from Arizona, and your father died. 
 Yeah, let me get my mom. 
 It's just the two of you. 
 What do you know about running a motel, anything? 
 'Cause you look like a little kid to me. 
 I don't think you could run much of nothing. 
 Can I help you with something? 
 I think it's you that needs help. 
 Really? How might that be? 
 I'm Keith Summers. 
 Summers! 
 This is my family's property. 
 My great-great-grandfather built this house in 1912, and my grandfather built that motel in the '50s. 
 And that's my grandmother's rug! 
 This property has been in my family for over a century. 
 I'm sure it was very hard for you to lose it to the bank, and I'm very sorry, but, uh... well, it is ours now. 
 I know everything about this place. 
 Every nook and cranny. 
 Every dirty secret. 
 You don't know how this place works. 
 This town? 
 You know nothing about this town. 
 What makes you think you can run this place by yourself? 
 Because I can. 
 Now get the hell off my property. 
 And if I ever see you here again I will call the police, or I will shoot you myself. 
 You're gonna call the police? 
 Get in, get in! 
 Go ahead, call the police. 
 I go fishing with half of 'em. 
 I grew up here. This is my house! 
 So you're gonna call the cops on me? 
 Well go ahead! Go ahead, call 'em! 
 Do you think you should've said all that stuff to him? 
 He's just some pathetic, drunk loser slob, honey. 
 He's--he's not gonna bother us anymore.

 Hi, are you Mrs. Bates? 
 I am. 
 I'm Bradley Martin. 
 Oh, we're friends with Norman from school and we're going to the library, and we were wondering if he wanted to come study with us. 
 Hey. 
 Hey, Norman. 
 I'm sure he would love to go, but we're in the middle of a lot of stuff. 
 We still have unpacking to do. 
 I totally understand. 
 I like your house. It's so cool. 
 Thank you. There's-- 
 We got a lot of work to do, but it's--it's got potential. 
 Well, maybe I could-- 
 No, Norman, not tonight. 
 No, it's not a good idea, no. Another time. 
 No worries. 
 It was really nice meeting you, Mrs. Bates. 
 Nice to meet you too. Thanks for stopping by. 
 Nice to meet you. 
 Good night, Norman. 
 See you, Norman. 
 See ya. [Laughs] 
 How could you do that? 
 You didn't even let me answer. 
 Well, there was no point in answering because I knew you would say "Yes," and I knew that I would have to say "No." 
 I could have gone, mom. 
 You can go another time, when we're settled in. 
 This is what it's always gonna be like with you. 
 "Later." 
"Another time." 
 When, mom? 
 You said you wanted me to have a life here-- this is how you have one! 
 You meet friends, you let other people in your life! 
 Friends? 
 Yeah, she's pretty. 
 Maybe she kind of likes me. I'm 17! 
 Norman, you don't even know them! 
 You have to be a little careful. 
 Why do I have to be careful? 
 Norman, don't lose your temper with me! 
 I'm just looking out for you. 
 Well, maybe you better just stay there the rest of the night then! 
 I suck. 
 Oh, my God, you're so cute. 
 You actually thought we were gonna go study. 
 Yeah.

 Norman, no matter what, this will become public. 
 And it'll be in all the papers. 
 Everyone in town will know about it. 
 Who is gonna book a room in the rape/murder motel? 
 It will ruin us! 
 It's gonna make me a laughingstock. 
 You know, we came here to start over. 
 We came here to start over. I am starting over! 
 And where the hell were you, Norman? 
 I-I was upstairs. 
 No, you were not! You were not upstairs. 
 If you were upstairs, you would have come down, and you would have helped me. So where were you? 
 I snuck out of my room and went to a party. 
 Mom, I thought I was gonna study with them, but they took me to a party. I didn't know. 
 It hardly matters right now. There's a-- there's a dead man on the floor, there's a lake of blood! 
 What are we supposed to do, clean this up with paper towels and spray cleaner? 
 I don't think so.

 Okay.

 It's gonna be okay. It's okay. 
 Look, it's gonna be fine. 
 It's gonna be okay. 
 Here's what we're gonna do... 
 Okay, we're gonna take all the bed linens from every motel room, and we're gonna use it to soak this all up. 
 We're gonna wrap the body in one of the comforters, and we'll put it in a-- in one of the tubs in one of the motel rooms just-- just until I can figure out what to do with it tomorrow. 
 Okay. Yeah? 
 Norman, I'm sorry. 
 I'm sorry that this dirtbag raped me, okay? 
 But here you are, and here I am, and he's not gonna win this one.

 Why didn't the real estate guy tell you that? 
 Because, Norman, people suck. 
 I'll tell you, everyone I have ever known has sucked. 
 Except you.

 I'm the worst mother in the world. 
 Mother-- 
 Look at what we're doing, Norman. 
 You deserve so much better. 
 You know, when you were born, it was like God gave me a second chance. And all I ever wanted was for life to be beautiful for you, and look at it. 
 Look at what your life has been. 
 I mean, what good am I doing you? 
 Mom, you're everything... everything to me. 
 And I don't ever want to live in a world without you. 
 You're my family. 
 My whole family, my whole life, my whole self. 
 You always have been.

 You're the best thing that has ever happened to me. 
 I love you too, mom.

 Okay, look, look, look, look, look! 
 I turned it on. 
 I made it blue. It's your favorite color. 
 It's cool, mom. 
 Yeah. 
 It's ours, Norman. It's our very own. 
 And you know what? You know that new bypass? 
 They're not gonna build it. 
 When did that happen? 
 It didn't, yet. 
 I'll think of something. 
 [Chuckles] I'm sure you will. 
 What's important is that we're together. 
 And as long as we're together, then nothing bad can really happen. 
 Right, Norman? 
 Right, mother. 
 Yeah.
