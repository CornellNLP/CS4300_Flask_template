 Previously on Bates Motel...  
 I also think that they thought that Johnny was worth two of our guys, and two of our guys is worth ten of their guys or maybe 12, or however many I can get in one place at one time. 
 He's blacked out twice in front of me. 
 And he told me it's happened before. 
 He, like, leaves his mind. 
 He can physically move, and he can talk a little, but he's not in there. 
 It's me, Cody. Can you hear me? 
 I didn't tell your mom. I told Emma. 
 That's as good as telling my mom. 
 I got to go to work. What's this guy doing here? 
 I came here to talk to your daughter. 
 What? 
 Just go back to bed, dad. 
 [Both yelling] 
 Dad! 
 Norman, where are you? 
 This is not cool, okay? 
 Honey, I know you're mad, but you can't just walk down a road and disappear on me. 
 I'm at city hall right now picking up a parking pass or something they called me about, but I'm gonna be home soon, and we need to talk, okay? 
 [Sighs] 
 I'm worried about you, so please call me. 
 [Indistinct chatter, telephones ringing] 
 [Sighs] 
 Norma Bates? 
 Hi. 
 I'm Anne Dietrich. We spoke on the phone. 
 Oh, yes, of course. Nice to meet you. 
 Glad you could get here before we close for the evening. 
 I have everything together for you... parking pass, I.D. card, keys. 
 I wanted you to have it as much in advance as possible. 
 Well, I appreciate that. 
 I know I'm gonna be playing catch-up. 
 Well, I'm sure you can handle it. 
 Would you like to see your office? 
 I have an office? 
 Right this way. 
 I didn't know this came with an office. 
 I mean... I mean, it's nice. 
 I mean, it's good to have an office. 
 Yeah. 
 Mrs. Bates. 
 Max Borowitz... Councilman, District 4. 
 Oh, nice to meet you. 
 Welcome. 
 Thank you. 
 Can you come to my office for a minute? 
 I'd like to run something by you. 
 Absolutely. 
 Great. 
 I'm really sorry I missed that last meeting when you called Lee Berman a dick. 
 Yeah, well, uh, I'm a little embarrassed about all that now. 
 Don't be. He was, God rest his soul. 
 What's weird is the way you ended up taking his place on the council. 
 Life is funny, huh? 
 Yeah, I guess it is. [Sighs] 
 Yeah, i-it makes me feel a little bad. 
 Seat opened up, and you got it. 
 How did you get it? 
 How did I get it? 
 Uh-huh. 
 I just met with the Mayor. 
 [Scoffs] You're funny. 
 Let's cut right through the crap. 
 I know you don't want the bypass. 
 That's your issue, and... 
 Max, I need to talk to Norma. 
 Oh, okay. 
 Excuse us. [Chuckles] 
 That was really embarrassing, Alex. 
 Why'd you pull me out of there like that? 
 Because something happened. I need you to come with me. 
 What? Is it Norman or Dylan? 
 What? What happened? 
 They're okay. 
 Just come with me. 
 What the hell is going on? Tell me right now. 
 Stop, okay? 
 Something happened, all right? Norman's fine. 
 You said that already, but what? 
 He was with Cody Brennen at her place, and there was some kind of fight, apparently. 
 Her father's dead. 
 How did he die? 
 Norman's saying it was self-defense. 
 There was a fight. 
 Her dad got pushed down the stairs. 
 [Crackling electricity] 
 [Truck door opens] 
 [Sighs] Okay, look, here's what's gonna happen... 
 I want to see Norman. 
 I know you do, but there's a process we need to go through for something like this. 
 Something like what? 
 When somebody dies and the circumstances aren't clear. 
 You said it was self-defense. 
 I said Norman said that. 
 Now we're looking into it. 
 You don't believe him? 
 Norma, what I'm doing is I'm following procedure and covering all the bases. 
 This is normal, okay? You want something? 
 You want water, cup of coffee? 
 I just want to see Norman. 
 Okay. 
 Just sit tight, be patient, and you will. 
 [Door buzzes] 
 Turn your head to the left and lift your chin, please. 
 Thank you. And now the same to the right. 
 Okay. 
 Open. 
 Okay, you can relax. 
 Can I, uh... Can I just ask? 
 W-what are you gonna do with all that stuff... you know, the... the nails and the finger clips? 
 You know, what are... what are you gonna do with... 
 It's evidence for the investigation. 
 But it was an accident. There was an accident. Why do... 
 Take your shirt off. Put this one on, please. 
 Why? 
 Oh, no, I-I told Sheriff Romero. 
 It's... it's my blood, not mister... 
 I-I got hit, you know, in... in the face. 
 I was bleeding. It's mine. 
 Well, then I am sure that's what the lab will say. 
 He just fell back down the stairwell. 
 It... it was an accident. 
 Accidents need to be investigated, too, to make sure they were actually accidents. 
 Okay, that's it. 
 We're done in here for now. 
 Is Cody all right? Can I talk to her? 
 Later maybe, not right now. 
 Can I go? 
 Not right now. 
 So what's going on with you, man? 
 Tell me what's happening. 
 I thought we were friends. 
 It's just some personal sh... 
 With my mother. 
 I'll deal with it. 
 Well, you get tired of sleeping down here or with the boss, you're welcome to come and crash at my place. 
 Sleeping with the boss? 
 [Chuckles] 
 Yeah, she called me up, told me she was picking you up at the hospital, not me. 
 Then I don't see you for about a day and a half. 
 You know, based on the 23 years I've been working for this family and knowing a little bit about Jodi Morgan, I'm kind of kojaking that that's what happened. 
 [Chuckles] 
 So how was it? 
 How was what? 
 Come on... 
 Details. 
 [Scoffs] Not a chance. 
 This place used to be a cannery. 
 The family took it over about 20 years ago. 
 And this is Dylan and Remo... 
 Hard at work, it seems. 
 Oh, hey, Teddy came and picked up that order for Orange County, boss. 
 We're... we're done for the day, really. 
 Well, unless you need us to do something. 
 Nope. Thanks, but I'm good. 
 Who's your friends? 
 Just some buddies. 
 They're gonna do a job for us. 
 Doing what? 
 Not your concern right now. 
 Come on. 
 He's going rogue on us... 
 Wonderful. 
 What do you think he's got planned? 
 Nothing good, that's for sure. 
 Norma? 
 Emma, what are you doing here? 
 I heard about what happened. Is Norman okay? 
 He's in there talking to Sheriff Romero. 
 How did you find out? 
 My dad heard about it in town. 
 From what I heard, it was self-defense. 
 They can't be blaming Norman. 
 He would never do anything like this. 
 Oh, this is crazy. I'm sorry. 
 But they can't just not tell you anything and leave you hanging like this. 
 I want to know what's going on in there. 
 Well, let's find out. 
 You shouldn't be alone. I'm gonna stay with you... all night if that's what it takes. 
 Honey, you are so sweet. I-I can't let you do that. 
 Go back home. Take care of the motel. 
 That's how you can help. 
 Okay, thank you so much for checking in on us. 
 That... that just means the world. 
 You're such a good girl. 
 Thank you. 
 [Knock at door] 
 Got everything we need from Norman Bates... blood, hair, prints, you name it. 
 I woke up my buddy at the state lab so we can get the stuff processed. 
 You woke him up? Did I even ask you to do this? 
 Well, no, but he doesn't mind. 
 He was my assistant back when I ran the lab. 
 This is one of those "it's good to know someone" situations. 
 We'll get the results back fast. 
 I'm just not sure how much nail clippings are gonna tell us. 
 You never know. 
 You can't discount anything when you got a dead body. 
 And if you want to know my opinion... 
 Uh, no, I don't actually think I do. 
 Just go. 
 Okay. 
 In fact, if you want to drive those evidence samples to Portland to your lab-tech friend, go right ahead and do that. 
 He's coming to pick 'em up. 
 Great. 
 I told him I can't leave here. 
 Then go wait for him. 
 Okay. 
 [Laughs] 
 [Sighs] 
 [Laughs] 
 Excuse me? I need to talk to Sheriff Romero. 
 I've been waiting to see my son. 
 I need to know when that's going to happen. 
 I don't know, Mrs. Bates, but I'll pass the message on to the Sheriff. 
 No, that's not good enough. 
 I either want to see my son right now, or I want Sheriff Romero to tell me personally why I can't see him so I can tell my lawyer. 
 Mrs. Bates, you can come back now. 
 [Sighs] 
 Regina? 
 [Door buzzes] 
 Oh, honey. 
 Look at you. 
 You must have been so scared. 
 Why did you go to that girl's house? 
 Your face. 
 Oh. 
 Are you hurt? 
 It's not that bad. 
 What happened? Tell me everything. 
 I went over to see Cody 'cause I was mad at her for telling Emma about my blackout and Emma telling you. 
 We were arguing, and... and then her dad came out and was really angry and started hurting Cody. 
 So I tried to help her, and he hit me. 
 Then I just tried to push him away, and he fell down these really steep stairs, and... 
 You can't tell them that you were arguing with Cody, honey. 
 Why... why wouldn't I tell them that? 
 Because you... you... You can't tell them that you black out, Norman. 
 T-they're not gonna understand that. 
 What do you mean? 
 Just tell them that you went over to hang out or watch TV or something. 
 No, no. He was only mad 'cause I was mad. 
 He yelled 'cause I was yelling, and Cody came between us, and he hit her. 
 Well, make sure you tell them that. 
 I did. 
 Why are you so worried? It was an accident. 
 I know. I know it was. 
 I'm sure you were very frightened and things just were happening so fast. 
 Why don't you believe me? 
 Norman, I'm just trying to make you see how them knowing certain things will make it impossible for them to believe you like I do. 
 It was an accident. 
 Hey. Sorry about the delay. 
 You want to come back with me, Norman? 
 So what's happening now? 
 We just... we need to go through everything one more time. 
 But he has to have me in there too, doesn't he? 
 He's still a minor. Isn't that the law? 
 No, he's not under arrest. He's just talking to me. 
 You don't legally have to be in there. 
 But if Norman wants you in there anyway, that's fine with me. 
 No, I-I don't. 
 She can stay out here. 
 Okay. All right. 
 We'll be back soon. 
 Alex? 
 It's a couple questions... just some things I didn't have time for. 
 Questions about what? 
 Norma, you have to try and disengage a little, all right? 
 You're gonna make yourself crazy. 
 Disengage? I'm his mother. Are you kidding? 
 You're gonna patronize me over this? 
 I've done your laundry. 
 We're just gonna talk and make sure we're not missing anything, and then we'll be done. 
 I was just trying to protect her. 
 You know, we were all pulling on each other, and... 
 Then he turned on me and... and lunged at me, and I... 
 I-I pushed back at him, and he just... just stumbled back and went all the way down the stairwell. 
 I just didn't move. 
 I keep seeing his face when he was falling. 
 Yeah, it's a hard thing to see. 
 So, um... 
 What's... what's gonna happen to Cody? 
 [Sighs] Well, you know, she's 17, so she still needs a guardian. 
 Her aunt, her mother's sister... she lives near Fort Wayne. 
 We got in touch with her, and she's gonna go there. 
 Well, is she nice? 
 Yeah. 
 As much as you can tell on the phone, yeah. 
 Well, that's good. 
 [Sighs] 
 You know, Norman... 
 [Sighs] 
 Jimmy Brennen... he grew up here, so I knew him for a long, long time, and he was angry for pretty much all of it. 
 But if I hadn't of been there when he woke up, then he'd still be alive right now. 
 Nothing can change that. 
 You're right. You're right. 
 Have some cocoa while it's hot, huh? 
 Hey. You all right? 
 How did you know I was here? 
 I got a phone call from a friend... well, actually, two friends. 
 It's a small town. Gossip travels at the speed of light. 
 Gossip? 
 Don't worry about that. 
 It doesn't matter. Is Norman all right? 
 Norman isn't even near all right. 
 He's very upset. He's worried. 
 He doesn't know what's going on. 
 What they're doing here, Norma... it's just standard procedure. 
 Okay, well, when can we go home? 
 When they've got all the facts down. 
 You're a lawyer. Do you know how all this works? 
 I do. 
 Norman, um... 
 He just wanted to talk to Cody. 
 And then he comes barging in. 
 He's drunk. He won't listen. 
 He's making accusations. 
 And then he attacks Norman and then his own daughter, and she is so small. 
 She's like a little bird. 
 How is she gonna stand a chance against a man like that? 
 She needed help. Norman only ever wants to help. 
 Norma, I don't do criminal law, but I know enough that if that's what happened, Norman has absolutely nothing to worry about. 
 Okay. [Sniffles] 
 So we go in the front gate, hit 'em front on, right? 
 No one will know what's happening. 
 Yeah? 
 All right. 
 So what are those guys here for? 
 Why? 
 No, I just thought that if you were... if you were planning something, maybe I could help out. 
 Oh, hey, speaking of plans... 
 I know about yours. 
 Well, I guess it's more my sister's plan... 
 You know, for you to watch my back. 
 And, no, Jodi didn't tell me, if that's what you're wondering, although I do get why she wants you to do it. 
 It's not like that. 
 Dude, it's fine. 
 I get it. 
 I got out of jail, and she just handed me this job. 
 She didn't even hesitate. 
 So, if that's what she wants to do, then... 
 I'm good. 
 I just wanted you to know that, uh... 
 I knew. 
 I probably don't need to tell you. 
 You look like you know your way around women, but, uh, if you're gonna sleep with my sister, manage your expectations. 
 I don't... 
 Yeah, sure, I know. 
 It's just, uh... 
 It's not her first time below her pay grade. 
 You're keeping me from getting hurt, right? 
 I don't want you to get hurt either. 
 [Toilet flushes] 
 How are you, Cody? 
 Bad. 
 Um, I know you don't like me. 
 I can understand that. It's probably my fault anyway. 
 But, please... 
 You can't tell them about Norman's blackouts. 
 Why would that even come up? 
 Well, I don't know. 
 I don't know what they're going to ask you. 
 They're gonna ask me what happened when my dad died. 
 Of course. I know. 
 I am sorry. 
 But they might just ask about Norman, in general. 
 And if they do, the fact that he's blacked out on occasion... they might make that something it's not. 
 Why? 
 I don't know. 
 They might think there's something wrong with him. 
 Is there? 
 It's not relevant to this. 
 You think it is. 
 Even though Norman didn't black out tonight, to you, it's connected. 
 Tell me why you don't want me to say anything, and I won't. 
 You saw him firsthand when he was like that. 
 Did he hurt you? 
 Did he hurt anyone? Was he angry or uncontrollable? 
 No, right? 
 He just wasn't himself, and there's no good reason that anyone should know that. 
 But... 
 
 
 
 You done in here, hon? 
 Your aunt's on the phone for you. 
 [Rattling] 
 Um, thanks for letting me come meet you. 
 What do you want, Emma? 
 If Norma put you up to this, you might as well tell me now so we don't waste each other's time. 
 She didn't. She has no idea I'm even here. 
 You want anything? 
 No, no, I'm good. 
 But the reason I'm here is about her and Norman. 
 He's down at the police station. Cody Brennen's father died. 
 Yeah, I know. 
 Norma left me a voice mail. 
 Have they arrested him yet? 
 I don't know all the details, but from everything I've heard, it was an accident. 
 Yeah, well, if it was an accident, then it's no big deal. 
 What am I supposed to do about it, anyways? 
 You could be there for them, for Norman. 
 That's what you could do. 
 Norman doesn't connect with a lot of people. 
 You matter to him. 
 I can't help him, okay? 
 He's just gonna have to figure some things out for himself, especially between him and Norma. 
 They only care about each other. 
 Whatever you guys fought about, can't you just take a break, just for right now? 
 So, basically, it doesn't matter how people treat you? 
 When they need something, you just go running back. 
 Is that how it is? 
 Is that what happened? 
 It doesn't matter. 
 I'm not going. 
 Somebody died. Are you just gonna let him figure that out for himself, let him deal with it on his own? 
 I can't fix this. 
 Of course you can't. 
 So don't go. Don't help. Don't do anything. 
 You know, I wish I had a mother and a brother I could treat like sh... 
 [Oxygen tank rattling] 
 [Door closes] 
 Norma, know that I'm here for you... anything you need. 
 I promise I'll help you. 
 This is all gonna be fine. 
 Why are you so nice? 
 Mother? 
 Sheriff. Phone for you. 
 Uh, you guys can have a few minutes. 
 Why is he here? 
 George came to see if we are all right, to help us. 
 Hey, Norman. 
 Uh, you know what? You guys have had a long night. 
 I'll give you some privacy. 
 George? 
 Thank you so much. 
 It's gonna be okay. 
 He's an attorney. He can help us. 
 With what? 
 [Door opens] 
 Cody. 
 Are you okay? 
 I need some fresh air. 
 Norman. 
 [Sighs] You guys must be exhausted. 
 I'm gonna have a deputy take you home. 
 Really? 
 Yeah, you can go. 
 We're done with Norman for now. 
 [Sniffles] 
 Why didn't you let me do that for you, Norman? 
 Oh, it's fine, mom. I got it myself. 
 Okay. 
 Oh, no, does he think I'm a murderer? 
 Sheriff Romero? 
 No, your, uh, friend... 
 George. 
 Oh. 
 [Scoffs] No, honey, no. 
 He knows you could never do something like that. 
 How? 
 Because I told him. 
 But he doesn't even know me. 
 I told him about you. 
 So you just told him, and... and he believed it, even though he doesn't know me? 
 And I told you, and... and you know me better than anyone. 
 And you didn't? 
 And you still don't? 
 That's not true. 
 Whether or not you like Cody or if I should have been there, I was there, and I couldn't let him hurt her. 
 I had to try to help her. 
 Are... are you mad at me? Did... did I do something wrong? 
 It's not that. 
 Well, then what is it? 
 Why don't you believe me? 
 I do. 
 But... What? 
 Sweetheart, it's... it's just... 
 [Sighs] 
 I don't know what you want me to say. 
 I'm not hungry anymore. 
 Hi. 
 I didn't want to text or call or bug you, but what's going on? 
 Is everything settled? Is it over? 
 I-I don't know. 
 They let me go home last night, so... 
 If they were gonna arrest you for something, they would have by now, right? 
 Or they're not going to anyway because obviously it was an accident. 
 Are you okay? 
 I guess, yeah. 
 You know, I mean, it's... it's way worse for Cody and for her dad. 
 Yeah. No, I know. 
 But still, it must have been so awful. 
 I was mad at her... Cody... you know, for telling you about what happened to me. 
 That's why I went over there, because if she hadn't have told you, then you couldn't have told my mom. 
 I'm sorry, Norman. 
 I was just worried about you, scared for you. 
 If anything had happened to you and I hadn't said something that could've helped... 
 I know. I-I'm sorry. 
 I just... 
 I know you did the right thing, and I'm not mad anymore, not at you. 
 I was just telling you the reason I was at Cody's in the first place. 
 Yeah, well, I'm sorry. 
 I mean, I can't ever trust you again, but I'm not mad. 
 Shut up. 
 Emma... 
 Thank you. 
 I mean it. 
 For what? 
 For believing in me. 
 Whatever. You're welcome. 
 [Cell phone chimes] 
 _ 
 [Breathing heavily] 
 Hey. 
 Hey. 
 God, I was so worried about you. 
 They wouldn't let me talk to you. 
 They wanted to make sure we couldn't get our stories straight. 
 I mean, look at us... total Bonnie and Clyde. 
 I'm so sorry. 
 Now he's always gonna be pissed off and bitter and drunk... 
 Blaming me for whatever. 
 It was his own fault. 
 That's why this happened, you know, because he chose to be like that, and he came in like he did, and it all happened, and he died. 
 So don't blame yourself. 
 I got to go. 
 I just wanted to say that before I left. 
 What, you're... you're just leaving now now? 
 They won't let me go back to my place even if I wanted to. 
 What, so you're just going to Indiana? 
 Yep. [Chuckles] 
 Hoosiers, here I come. 
 My aunt already cleaned out the guest room, she said. 
 She has five cats, so her place probably smells like cat pee instead of beer and smoke. 
 Man, I can't wait until I'm 18, so I can pick the way my place smells. 
 Will you text me when you get there so I can call you? 
 Norman... 
 Calling, texting... 
 I know myself. 
 I'm not gonna do that. 
 Isn't it better to just say good-bye right now, face-to-face, when it's still real? 
 Your mom at the Sheriff's station... she warned me not to talk about your blackouts. 
 Oh, yeah, I know. 
 She didn't want them to get the wrong idea. 
 I know. 
 No, she begged me. 
 She said something happens to you in them. 
 You change. They can make you do things. 
 What? What happens to me? 
 I don't know, but she knows, and you got to make her tell you, Norman, 'cause whatever it is, it scares the sh1t out of her. 
 [Engine turning over] 
 [Vehicle approaching] 
 Hey. 
 I, uh... I just wanted to come by and tell you, uh, Jimmy Brennen's death has been officially ruled an accident. 
 [Sighs] 
 Okay, so that's it? 
 Yeah. Yeah, that's it. 
 Yeah, it ended up being pretty straightforward. 
 I'm sorry Norman had to go through that. 
 Okay. Thank you... 
 No, thank you for... for being patient, and, you know, um... 
 I'll, uh... I'll talk to you later. 
 Okay. 
 All right. 
 [Engine turning over] 
 Norman! 
 Norman! 
 Norman. 
 Norman, Sheriff Romero just stopped by. 
 The investigation... it's done. 
 It's over. They ruled it an accident. 
 Oh, my God. 
 Oh, my God, I'm so relieved. 
 I can see that. Cody was here earlier. 
 Was she? 
 Yeah, she's leaving. 
 She's, uh... she's moving to Indiana to be with her aunt. 
 Right now? 
 Forever? 
 Mm-hmm. 
 Well, for your sake, I'm sorry. 
 I know you'll miss her, but sometimes a fresh start's good for the soul, right? 
 I'm glad she came over to say good-bye to you, though. 
 She came over to tell me that, uh, you're lying to me... 
 That there's something really wrong with me and that you know what it is. 
 That girl could've ruined your entire life the other night. 
 Have you missed the fact that she's not a stable person? 
 No, you told her something happens to me when I black out. 
 Norman. 
 You said I change, that I'm not myself. 
 Who am I, mother? Who am I, and what do I do? 
 Norman... 
 I love you so much. 
 [Sniffles] 
 And I did say those things. 
 And they are true. 
 But we are not gonna talk about them. 
 What? 
 You have to trust that I am protecting you, I know you better than anyone, because I'm not gonna answer your question, and I don't want you to ever ask me again! 
 [Door closes] 
 Hey. 
 You were curious what we had going on? 
 Yeah. 
 Now's the time. Come with us. 
 Come where? 
 Are you too busy? 
 We got something we're gonna go do. 
 Yeah? What's that? 
 If you come with us, you'll know. 
 Come on, you can't watch me if you don't come with me. 
 And Remo... he's your guy. 
 Let's not forget about Remo. 
 Yeah, he's gonna go with, uh, Chuck and Sid. 
 And you... 
 You're gonna ride with us. Come on. 
 [Turn signal clicking] 
 Lights. 
 You're gonna raid Nick Ford's warehouse? 
 That's right. 
 Don't do this. 
 "A" for effort, gold star... 
 I'll tell my sister you tried. 
 Look, think this through. 
 You don't think I have? 
 We're telling them, you go up against us, it's gonna be five times more painful for them. 
 We're sending them a message. 
 That's not the right message. 
 It's too big, all right? 
 And everything about it's wrong.

 [Gunfire] 
 [Groans] 
 [Cell phone ringing]
