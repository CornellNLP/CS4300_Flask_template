 Previously on Bates Motel...  
 Miss Watson is dead. 
 Apparently, someone killed her. 
 Norman came to see me today. 
 He brought me a photo he took of a man out at Blaire Watson's grave. 
 You need to tell me what happened that night. 
 She took me to her house. 
 It was weird. 
 I felt like something was happening, Like she was attracted to me or something. 
 You know, I just remember feeling almost like I was gonna faint, and then the next thing I know, I was running home. 
 Your dad was sleeping with Blaire Watson, And she also happened to be Gil's girlfriend, and when Gil found out, he wasn't very happy. 
 Bradley Martin. What do you want? 
 I want to know who killed my dad. 
 Oh, I can tell you stuff you don't want to hear. 
 Did you mean what you said when you said you'll always be here for me? 
 Because I need your help. 
 Bradley, wake up. 
 Bradley, wake up. 
 You have to tell me now why you're here. 
 I can't. I told you I can't, Norman. 
 [sighs] 
 Listen, there's some stuff that I need to... 
 No, I can't help you unless you tell me. 
 I need some money, maybe a bus ticket is the way to go. 
 I mean, it's harder to track than a... than a plane or... 
 Bradley! 
 You're putting me in an impossible situation, okay? 
 I want to help you. I want to be there for you. 
 Then be here. 
 I need to know that what you're doing make sense. 
 I killed the guy that killed my dad. 
 We should talk about what birth control you're using. 
 It doesn't matter. I'm not having s*x. 
 Do you know anything about blackouts? 
 Blackouts? 
 Yeah, you know, when a person goes into a trance-like state And... and then wakes up later and doesn't know what happened in that time? 
 Have you been experiencing these? 
 Me? 
 No. 
 No, uh, it's my sister. 
 She's had tests done, cat scans, and things. 
 No one can find anything. 
 There's nothing physically wrong with her, which is good because that means she's normal, right? 
 I'm just... I'm just worried that something else might be wrong. 
 I mean, why do these things keep happening? 
 This isn't my area of expertise. 
 Oh, no, I know. I know that. 
 I'm just assuming that you went to medical school, you studied the human body. 
 I'm... I'm just curious what your opinion is. 
 I mean, what could cause blackouts if there's nothing physically wrong with you? 
 Well, if it isn't a physical disorder, it could be a mental disorder. 
 I could refer you to a psychiatrist? 
 No, it's... it's okay. 
 No. 
 She doesn't live here. 
 [radio chatter] 
 Now we know why he wasn't answering his phone. 
 Hey, we should get out of here. 
 Just keep moving. Keep driving. 
 Why? We didn't do anything wrong. 
 I want to know what's going on. 
 Well, you're about to find out. 
 Here comes Mr. Sheriff. 
 What are you doing here? 
 Nothing. We came over to see Gil. 
 Well, there he is. 
 What's left of him, minus the hole in his face. 
 Oh, my God. 
 Anything you can tell me about this? 
 Anything unusual going on or anything he was upset about? 
 No. Nothing. 
 No, think about it a little bit harder, because this wasn't nothing, okay? 
 This wasn't some pissant trimmer who just got shot. 
 This is Gil Turner. 
 You hearing me? 
 He knows what this means. 
 You hear anything, you let me know, 'cause I'm gonna get who did this. 
 [crackling electricity] 
 Now, you haven't been in the business long enough To even understand the implications of this. 
 Okay, dad. 
 Shut up. 
 Romero was not wrong, you know. 
 Taking out a guy like Gil, that's like a declaration of war right there. 
 You think the other operation did this? 
 Yeah, there's no doubt in my mind. 
 I mean, we've been stealing their business, but for them to retaliate this way, Ah, that's just not done. 
 So, what, I'm supposed to decide What to do with 'em now? 
 This is a little bit above your pay grade. 
 Let's see who they bring in. 
 It's gonna be his problem. 
 Hello, Nick. 
 I haven't seen you around lately. 
 I've been in mourning, Alex. 
 Yeah. 
 Hasn't been easy, especially given how she and I left it. 
 Somebody killed Gil Turner. 
 Let me put your mind at ease. 
 We had nothing to do with it. 
 You know, Nick, I tolerate certain things, and believe me, I know the nature of the business That fuels this town, you know? 
 Violence goes with the territory, but not this. 
 I'm not gonna sit by and let things get out of control between the two families. 
 I can't help but wish you'd use the same level of effort to catch Blaire's killer. 
 But then she was just a school teacher, not some big player in the drug business. 
 I understand your priorities... 
 That's not the case at all, Nick. 
 We're working on it. 
 It's been four months and nothing. 
 [sighs] 
 I... you know, your daughter didn't live a simple life, Nick. 
 I know exactly the kind of life my daughter lived. 
 I know. 
 You know, we all work together, Alex. 
 We all try to respect each other or accommodate each other, and because of that, things in this little town Are pretty nice. 
 But it's not a given. 
 It's not written on some stone tablet somewhere that that's the way it has to be. 
 Norman? 
 What? 
 Do you want to do a musical? 
 Apparently there's, like, a community theater here. 
 It's a... like a family sort of thing, I guess. 
 They're doing South Pacific this summer. 
 I thought it'd be fun if we tried out together. 
 A musical? 
 Yeah! A musical. You love musicals. 
 We used to watch them all the time together on TV. 
 Yeah, well, that's watching them. 
 That's not doing them. 
 Come on! 
 South Pacific. 
 Wha... anybody can sing! We... we just do it. 
 We sing all the time. 
 We really don't, mother. 
 Yes, we do! 
 We used to sing all the time when you were little. 
 We used to sing all sorts of things. 
 ♪ I'm a little teapot, short and stout ♪ 
 [clicking tongue] 
 Please, please. Come on, I really need to. 
 You're just getting so grown up, and I want to be close... 
 [phone ringing] 
 Come on, it'll be a new adventure! 
 Something... some... some fun we could have together. 
 It'll get you out of the basement. 
 I haven't been in the basement for days. 
 Hello? 
 Yes, of course. He's right here. 
 It's Bradley Martin's mother? 
 Hello? 
 I'm so sorry. I-I haven't... 
 I haven't seen her or... or talked to her. 
 Uh-huh. No, I-I haven't, but... 
 Yeah, you know, I'll call you if I do. 
 I-I know she's been unstable. 
 I'm so sorry. 
 What happened? 
 Bradley Martin's been missing since last night. 
 You know, no one knows where she is. 
 I'm so sorry. That's terrible. 
 Well, why is she bothering you about it? 
 I-I don't really know. 
 [approaching footsteps] 
 [knocking on door] 
 You must be really worried about Bradley. 
 Yeah. 
 I-I... you know, I have no idea where she could be. 
 You sure? 
 You sure you don't know? 
 Yeah. 
 Because if you knew, you should tell me, because you know what her father did for a living, right? 
 Yeah, and I'm... I'm sure I don't know. 
 And I'd tell you if I did, okay? 
 [sighs] 
 Good night, Dylan. 
 Okay. Good night. 
 Oh, Dylan? 
 Maybe she's already dead. 
 You know, she tried to kill herself before. 
 Maybe she's dead. 
 Let's hope not. 
 Yeah. 
 $3.79. 
 Would you like some help with this, ma'am? 
 Yes. That would be great. 
 You waiting for something? 
 No. 
 So, you, uh, live here or you just visiting for the summer? 
 I-I live here. 
 I haven't seen you before. 
 Oh, uh, well, I've been here. 
 I mean, in White Pine Bay, I mean,  not here here in the grocery store. 
 You go to high school here? 
 I do, yeah. 
 You, uh, gonna dye your hair? 
 Hmm, it's for my mom. 
 You do errands for your mom. 
 Well, aren't you a dying a breed. 
 Yeah, I, uh... I guess we're all doing that, too. 
 What? 
 Dying. 
 You know, I mean, once we're born, that's what we're doing, right? 
 41 even. 
 Thank you. Have a nice day. 
 Yeah. If it's Becker, we're good. 
 If it's trace, we'll be even better. 
 It's gonna be one of those two guys, anyway. 
 Well, whoever it is, weren't they supposed to be here half an hour ago? 
 Yup. 
 [car door closes] 
 Zane? 
 [sighs] you got to be kidding me. 
 [groans] 
 Hey, Remo. 
 Zane. 
 Thanks. 
 So... [groans] 
 You must be Dylan Massett. 
 Yeah. 
 So it looks like I'm stepping in for Gil. 
 First order of business, we got to clean up the mess that Gil left behind. 
 Mess? 
 Yeah. 
 You see, Gil got himself killed, and you don't get yourself killed in this business without some culpability, right? 
 So, whatever happened, we need to address it. 
 All right. 
 Uh-huh. Got it. 
 The Blaire Watson case? We just caught a break. 
 [knocking on door] 
 Sheriff's department. Got a warrant! 
 [toilet flushes] 
 Upstairs! 
 Go, go. 
 I got down here. 
 [thud] 
 Okay, okay. 
 [grunts] 
 You're back, huh? 
 I thought I told you to stay out of town the last time I saw you. 
 What did I do? 
 I don't know. 
 Kyle, what did you do? 
 Norman? 
 Norman? 
 [sighs] 
 Norman? 
 Mother? 
 Mother! [rapid footsteps] 
 Mother? 
 What are you doing down here? 
 Looking for you. I downloaded some sheet music. 
 We need to figure out what we're singing. 
 The audition's tomorrow. 
 Well, let's get out of the basement. 
 We're not gonna sing down here. 
 Why? 
 You're afraid one of your stuffed animals might hear you? 
 So we're still doing this? 
 Yeah! It's gonna be great. What are you gonna sing? 
 I don't know. I-I don't sing, so... 
 [groans] don't be silly. Everybody sings. 
 It doesn't have to be fancy. 
 It's just community theater. It's just for fun. 
 And if these are too formal, you don't have to sing 'em. 
 Sing anything! 
 Well, I-I don't know any songs. 
 Okay, fine, you don't have to sing anything.

 I'll go make an ass out of myself for your sake, mother. 
 Okay. Thank you. I know you will. 
 [chuckles] 
 We know you had s*x with Blaire Watson within 30 hours of her turning up dead. 
 Do you have a camera in there? 
 We found a semen sample inside her that matches your DNA. 
 [sighs] 
 Was mine the only semen sample you found? 
 That's gonna come out in court. 
 We found two semen samples inside her. 
 Then why are we even talking? 
 Because, Kyle, you're the one we matched, and because three people died from tainted drugs that you sold, and 'cause I know you killed your old girlfriend. 
 Do you remember her? Remember Carly Walters? 
 I found her floating face-down out in the kelp beds. 
 Well, if you know I did all those things, then why don't you prove it? 
 Okay, let me try it this way then. 
 The semen samples, mine wasn't one of them. 
 Yours was. 
 So why don't you tell me about that? 
 She slept with a lot of different guys. 
 I mean, she's... 
 She had daddy issues or whatever. 
 I think that you would call her "troubled." 
 So... Can I go? 
 No, you're not going anywhere. 
 
 
 
 [water running] 
 Is it all out? 
 Well, it seems to be. The water's running clear. 
 Oh, I... I got you these too. 
 You have the ticket? 
 Yeah. 
 Uh, yeah. Tonight at 10:30. 
 It's a bus station in cold creek, up the coast. 
 It'll take a few hours to drive there. 
 You drive? 
 Oh, yeah. Yeah, I can drive. 
 I'll just borrow my mom's car. 
 Well, it'll be ready to go by 8:00. 
 Thank you, Norman... 
 For everything. 
 For the ticket and... 
 And the money, for everything. 
 Of course. 
 I always knew there was something special about you, something different. 
 I wasn't wrong. 
 I'll be back for you at 8. 
 Okay. 
 Who is this guy? 
 Zane? 
 He's a lame-ass poser. 
 Thinks he's a character out of Scarface. 
 He's the brother of the big boss, a guy who shouldn't be in the business who is. 
 What was he in prison for? 
 [laughs] 
 Our buddy Zane was running the shipment down to our distributors in Las Vegas. 
 Got clocked doing 95 and they pulled him over. 
 What kind of idiot speeds with a carload of weed? 
 [crow caws] 
 That's my point exactly. 
 Ah, here comes Kojak now. 
 Hey, boys. 
 Thought we could do some reconnaissance. 
 [taps on hood] 
 Help me get this out, will you? 
 This is Johnny b. He works for the Ford family. 
 [muffled whimper] 
 Get him out. 
 [clears throat] 
 [grunting] 
 Take off his gag. 
 Now, we know you guys killed Gil. 
 We didn't kill him. 
 Oh! Come... come on. 
 Come on. 
 Well, you need to send a message to your boss for me.

 I don't care, mother! I don't care how it looks! 
 I-I don't want to be here! Okay? 
 I don't want to do this! It's stupid! 
 You just get these ideas in your head, and everyone's supposed to want to do them, and then you get hurt if we don't! 
 And now all of a sudden, it's community theater! 
 Since when did you care about the theater? 
 It's a stupid musical! 
 I just wanted to do something fun with you. 
 Mother, we live together, yeah? 
 We work together. We eat every meal together. 
 We sleep six inches away from each other with a thin wall between us. 
 Don't you think that's probably enough? 
 Well, I just want to keep you close. 
 I want to protect you! 
 From what? 
 The night miss Watson was killed, do you remember anything About that night besides what you told me? 
 [shivers] No. 
 Where did you get those pearls? 
 I found them in my pocket the next morning, after that night. 
 I'm so scared. 
 I'm so scared. 
 [crying] I'm so scared. 
 I'm so scared. I'm so scared.

 I-I probably found the pearls at the... 
 At the dance and picked them up to turn them in to lost and found at school. 
 You know, it was nothing. 
 It's nothing. Please, just stop it. 
 You're getting all worked up over an idea about nothing. 
 Okay? Come on. Let's... let's go back in. 
 No, I can't, Norman. I'm too upset. 
 I... and you... 
 No, no. 
 You have to be somewhere. 
 No! We came here to do this. 
 You've prepared a song... [laughs] 
 And we're gonna do this together. 
 And like you said, it's gonna be fun.

 It'll break my heart if we go home now. 
 Okay.

 Okay. 
 Yeah, I really want to.

 Hey. 
 Dylan, I need you to listen to me. 
 Okay, you can't start asking a bunch of questions, 'cause time is of the essence. 
 I'm with mom and I can't get away or I would do this myself. 
 Okay. 
 I lied to you. 
 I-I lied to you, okay? 
 I-I do know what happened to Bradley. 
 She's hiding in our basement. 
 What? 
 She's in our basement And she's ready to be driven to cold creek to get on a bus that leaves in two hours that'll take her to Boston, Where she's gonna start her life over. 
 I'm not doing anything until you tell me Why she's in our basement. 
 She killed the man that killed her father. 
 Some guy named Gil Turner. 
 I-I think he worked in your business. 
 Dylan, you there? 
 Yeah. Yeah. I'm... I'm here. 
 So you'll do it? 
 You'll make sure she gets on the bus? 
 Yeah. 
 Thank you, Dylan.

 All right, I'll tell her.

 We got to go. I'm taking you.

 I don't think I can do this now. 
 You can do it. It's just pretending, right? 
 We can pretend.
