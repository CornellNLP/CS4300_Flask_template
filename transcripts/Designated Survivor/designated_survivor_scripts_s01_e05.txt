 Previously on "Designated Survivor"... 
 I don't understand. Where was I? 
 That's my question, Congressman. 
 Is there a reason you're asking all these questions? 
 Have I done something wrong? 
 Jason : You were supposed to get a statement, not turn him into a suspect. 
 Who is this? 
 Woman : Find room 105, and you'll understand more about Peter MacLeish. 
 My name is Seth Wright. 
 Earlier tonight, I was named White House Press Secretary. 
 Woman : He's an interesting guy, your boss. 
 I have what you asked for. Anything good? 
 Depends whose side you're on. 
 Is it true that you gave the order to take the Algerian air defenses offline? 
 Without clearing it through me. 
 I did what needed to be done. 
 General, you are fired. 
 Admiral... prepare us for war.

 [Cellphone beeps] 
 Yeah. 
 Aaron : Mr. President, it's time. 
 Chernow : The estimated battle damage assessment, BDA, indicates that we will level the entire compound and everything within a 50-foot radius, Mr. President. 
 Majid Nassar and his Al-Sakar cell will be dead by dawn. 
 Won't the laser-guided bomb's blast effect blow right through this village? 
 No, sir. 
 We only hit what we target. 
 Good morning, Mr. President. 
 You wanted to see me? 
 Tom : Thanks for coming in early. 
 Seth, you've met Admiral Chernow? 
 He's the new Chairman of the Joint Chiefs. 
 How are you, sir? 
 Seth Wright, Press Secretary. 
 Ah, it'll be a busy day for you, son. 
 I'll be in Command Ops. 
 Admiral. 
 Chernow : Sir. 
 I had to clear my entire schedule for the day. 
 Want to know why? 
 If I know why, do I have to lie to the press all day? 
 Yeah. 
 Okay, then let's just assume that maybe somewhere there's gonna be a military strike against the terrorist who bombed the Capitol, and I'll just know more when I know more. 
 Good man. 
 I can shuffle your schedule, sir, but the medal ceremony for first responders... your absence would be conspicuous. 
 There's no VP to fill in. 
 Then we'll make it work. I'll be there. 
 I thought  I  was up early. 
 I must've missed a memo. 
 Trying to get ahead of the day. 
 I'm losing proposition. 
 Well, you've won one in Michigan. 
 The Lieutenant Governor reversed Royce's orders to the state police. 
 The roundups arresting Muslim citizens... they've all ceased. 
 All it took was putting Governor Royce in federal prison. 
 We're gonna have to deal with that soon. Thank you. 
 I don't want to be out of line here, but is all of this about Majid Nassar? 
 Em, you did a great job in Michigan. 
 Right now, our main priority is Congress. 
 I need you to take point on that. 
 Of course. 
 ♪ 
 Man : The F-18s are just over the international marker, sir. 
 At your command, they'll target Algerian airspace and destroy the target. 
 Algerian air-defense radar still deactivated? 
 Yes. We'll be in and out. 
 No one will know until the villagers report the fireworks. 
 What's our contingency plan in case one of our planes goes down? 
 Man : Naval search and rescue chopper, full squadron of Marines standing by on the USS  Lexington. 
 Mr. President, the F-18s have less than 10 minutes before they have to consider refueling. 
 If this mission is a go, it needs to go now, sir. 
 ♪ 
 It's a go. Strike the enemy. 
 Yes, sir. 
 Patch me in to the  Lexington. 
 The President has given the order. 
 You may proceed. 
 Man : Admiral, you need to hold. 
 What's going on? 
 Sir, I'm getting reports from my station chief in Tangier. 
 We need to abort. 
 Why? 
 New intelligence indicates that the target is no longer in the compound. 
 We lost him, sir. 
 We lost Majid Nassar. 
 Satellite imagery from NRO confirms that Nassar left the compound two minutes ago in a small convoy of trucks. 
 It gets worse, sir. 
 How is that possible? 
 Seems Nassar was warned. 
 By someone inside the Algerian government? 
 Yes, sir. 
 Son of a bitch. 
 Apparently, just prior to leaving the compound, he received a call from someone inside the foreign ministry. 
 We did this, sir. We tipped our hand. 
 No, I did this trying to be diplomatic. 
 I need you all to use every resource available. 
 Do whatever you have to, but please find Majid Nassar. 
 [Chatter] 
 Damn it! 
 ♪ 
 Jason : Well, well, well. 
 I wasn't expecting to see you today. 
 So, what are you working on? 
 Capitol bombing. 
 So you decided to sleep on it. 
 Actually, I drank on it. 
 Hmm. 
 I hope it was a good bottle. 
 It was the Chardonnay you bought me last Christmas. 
 Lightweight. 
 So, what is all this? 
 I'm looking for Capitol Room 105. 
 You might want to try between 104 and 106. 
 It's not there. 
 And this room is significant why? 
 Well, I don't know that it is, but if the lead pans out, you'll be the first to know. 
 All right. Good to see you. 
 I'll be back in a few hours. I need to get to the White House. 
 Another briefing? 
 No, a medal ceremony. 
 President decided he wanted to honor MacLeish and the first responder that found him. 
 Do you mind if I tag along? 
 No, I think you should stay on that. 
 Well, the man is a hero and a patriot. 
 I would love to see MacLeish get a medal. 
 Oh, yeah? 
 That's exactly why I never gave you an undercover assignment... because you are a horrible liar. 
 Horrible.

 Lovely event. 
 But I have a question. 
 When is the United States going to respond to Majid Nassar's bombing of our Capitol? 
 When our intelligence services confirm his location. 
 You're way too smart to play dumb, Mr. Press Secretary. 
 I need to talk to the President. 
 The President's got a very busy schedule today. 
 I can wait. 
 Jason : About your room 105... you might want to check with the architect of the Capitol. 
 Be a pain in someone else's ass for a change, hmm? 
 Agent Wells. 
 Good to see you again. 
 Hannah : And you. 
 Congratulations. 
 Yeah, thank you. 
 Jason : Congrats. 
 Thank you. 
 ♪ 
 Did we find Nassar? Please sit. 
 Intelligence still places him in Algeria about 15 miles from the compound. 
 But there's a major problem. 
 What is it? 
 He's in the basement of a hospital with at least 100 staff and patients. 
 Now, if we move forward with an air strike as originally planned, we're going to kill a lot of civilians, including doctors and children. 
 Which is unacceptable. 
 What are our other options? 
 Only one, sir... Navy SEALs. 
 We'll minimize civilian casualties, but... 
 We'll have to put American boots on the ground. 
 It's the only way, sir. 
 May we proceed, Mr. President? 
 ♪ 
 Mr. President. 
 That's Keyhole satellite footage of a hospital where Nassar's holed up with extensive security. 
 And this is his convoy? 
 Yes. 
 Given the complexity of the mission, this has become a Tier One operation. 
 Now, JSOC is working with SEAL Team 6 to plan the assault. 
 Recent NSA chatter indicates the potential of new attacks by Al-Sakar, both at home and abroad. 
 Nassar could prove to be an extremely valuable source of intelligence. 
 Wait a second. 
 You're talking about taking Nassar alive? 
 Won't that increase the danger to our troops? 
 Chernow : Well, there are no perfect missions, sir, but our confidence is very high. 
 As much as I'd like to believe you, Admiral, I would like to talk to the man who's gonna be in charge of the mission on the ground. 
 Where is he?

 Unnecessary, Aaron.

 Hannah : As an expert on the architecture of the Capitol, I thought you could help the FBI. 
 Agent Wells, I've got everyone calling... NSA, DHS. 
 Whatever you need, tell my assistant. I'll get to it when I can. 
 I know you're busy. I just have one question. 
 Room 105... it's not in any of the Capitol directories. 
 Is that it? 
 Yeah. 
 Well, that's easy. 
 Room 105 wouldn't be in any official directory. 
 It's a hideaway office. 
 What is that? 
 It's a hidden office. 
 There are several throughout the Capitol assigned by seniority to members of Congress. 
 And they would have that because...? 
 Privacy, work, rest. 
 Helps with late-night votes. 
 Teddy Kennedy's was like a clubhouse. 
 Do you have the blueprints? 
 Had. 
 They were in our offices in the sub-basement of the Capitol. 
 I gave the digital plans to the guys on site. 
 You might want to check over there. 
 Okay, I will. 
 Thank you. 
 You're welcome. 
 Next time, wait your turn like everyone else. 
 Hookstraten : Thank you for taking the time, Mr. President. 
 I'll always make time for you, Kimble. 
 I know how busy you must be since your schedule's been cleared of most every appointment. 
 I suppose you could say I'm looking for explanations. 
 In one day, you fired your Chairman of the Joint Chiefs and arrested a sitting governor. 
 It's erratic, sir. 
 And now I find out that parking lot H at the Pentagon was full this morning at 3:00 a.m. 
 Parking lot H? 
 It's where combat command parks. 
 Two-star generals and up. 
 Is there a question you want to ask me? 
 Are we going to war, Mr. President? 
 I ask because we're not a dictatorship, and as the presumptive Speaker of the House, I'm here to remind you of your obligation to consult with Congress  before taking any military action. 
 Aaron : Helicopter's here, sir. 
 Article 1, Section 8. 
 I'm aware of the clause, and I will notify you as soon as it's appropriate. 
 Thank you, Mr. President. 
 It's reassuring to know that you're fully aware of your constitutional duties.

 Plane ride on a C-5 Galaxy to northern Mali. 
 From the forward operating base, we fly two Black Hawks into the landing zone. 
 About two miles from the hospital where Nassar is holed up. 
 Land just after midnight, set up a perimeter, carry out our assault all before daybreak. 
 You make it sound so simple. 
 Amateurs talk tactics, sir. 
 Professionals talk logistics.

 Chief Marino. About three years. 
 He's expecting his first kid in a couple of months.

 Just got married. 
 Spent his honeymoon with me here training for an op.

 Commander, there is something I need to know. 
 Admiral Chernow has great confidence in the operation, but you're the one who has to lead it. 
 What do you think the odds are? 
 We'll get it done, sir. 
 Forgive me, Commander, but that's not what I asked. 
 What are the odds? 
 We don't know if they've wired the place. 
 We don't know if they've got local militia in the area. 
 We don't know a lot of things, sir. 
 I'd say our odds are 50/50. 
 But we do know Nassar is there, so we have to do it now. 
 May God have mercy on them, because the United States Navy will have none. 
 Thank you, Commander.

 And what'd he say? 
 Nothing. 
 He had a heart attack a month ago. 
 He's dead. 
 All right, look, with all due respect to Mr. Sullivan, I got 1,000 people dead from this bombing, okay? 
 So why should I care about a... a construction worker with high cholesterol? 
 All right, point taken. Ask me about Ken Gibson. 
 Why don't you tell me about Mr. Gibson? 
 Car accident two weeks ago. 
 He's dead, too? 
 ♪ 
 All these guys are gone? 
 Not  gone. 
 Dead. All eight men who worked on room 105 where MacLeish was found are dead. All in the last two months and all accidents or natural causes. [Sighs] Clearly, that doesn't sound like a... Coincidence? No. [Alarm blaring] ♪ Hold fire. [Static] We got a kid down here. Check that room. Check that room. We're clear. [Sighs] When they go underground, you can expect the feed to be interrupted, Mr. President. Okay. ♪ Admiral, you've done what, hundreds of these missions? Does it ever get easier? No. But you don't want it to, sir. ♪ [Alarm continues] Mad Hatter's on the move. So, every single person that worked on room 105 is dead. What the hell were they renovating? That was my question exactly, so I asked Hector to recreate 105 from the debris using the architectural drawings, and this is what he came back with. Looks funny, right? That's because it's not supposed to be there. These are reinforced steel, but the beams are coated in highly durable elasto-polymer. And that does what? It improves air-blast resistance, rendering it virtually indestructible. Are you... are you saying that... Yeah. They built a bomb shelter... inside the U.S. Capitol. [Computer beeping] ♪ Target is close. Stand by to engage. Move, move, move. [Indistinct shouting] Calm down! Calm down! [Shouting continues] We have eyes on Mad Hatter. That's Majid Nassar. Jason : So, what are you saying? MacLeish's survival was planned? This is not theory anymore, Jason. This is not a figment of my imagination. During the State of the Union address, the Capitol blew up and everyone died. Everyone except one man. They really want you to put down your guns. ♪ [Children crying] [Alarm blaring] They said put down your guns! [Crying continues] ♪ [Indistinct shouting] [Explosion, girl screams] What the hell was that? We're working on that right now, sir. MacLeish : I've been in combat before, sir. It could just be a flashbang to disorient the enemy. Mr. President, we've currently lost all contact with our SEAL team, sir. You have to see how big this is. That there was a plan to make sure that only one person survived... him. Congressman Peter MacLeish. Jason. He's in on it. [Sighs] Come on. Come on. ♪ [Sighs] Still haven't reestablished contact with the SEALs yet, sir. We may have to prepare for the worst. This is my fault. I should've listened to General Cochrane. I should've bombed him when I had a shot. There's no shame in exhausting all possibilities. Mr. President. We have Majid Nassar. ♪ That means they made it. [Chuckling] They're alive. They're alive! Congratulations, sir. Thank you. Oh, my God. They made it! And we got Nassar. Got the b*st*rd, sir. [Laughs] Chernow : Mr. President. Congratulations, Admiral. There's been one casualty, sir. ♪ SEAL team leader Max Clarkson was shot and killed in action. Oh, no. ♪ Oh, no. ♪ There was seven children in the room. They were being held at gunpoint by the terrorists. It was a massacre waiting to happen. One of the terrorists opened fire. Commander Clarkson shielded two of the children with his own body while the rest of the SEALs returned fire, killing the terrorists. Clarkson took eight rounds to the back, one to the neck. He was killed instantly. The two children that he shielded... they survived. Because of him, we managed to capture Nassar alive with no civilian casualties. But that's exactly what you wanted. No. No. One of our men died. And he's dead because of the orders I gave him. But you made the best decision you could with the information you had, Tom. Even he said there was a 50/50 shot at success. I should've waited for better odds. Which may never have come. Tom, you took the country to war today because you thought it was the right decision. Casualties are inevitable. ♪ Emily : I still don't get it. MacLeish says he just wants to serve, but he's not interested in power. Not for power's sake, he said. We should have Bethesda send over MacLeish's CT and MRI scans. He said he wasn't raised that way. He sounded like a man with no political ambitions whatsoever. Who moves to D.C. and doesn't want power? Tom : Me. Please, sit. I didn't move to Washington, D.C., for power. But you have to admit it's unusual that MacLeish would turn down Speaker of the House. What? You haven't heard? ♪ No, I didn't. It's been a long day. ♪ What did he say? The man said he came to Washington to serve. He doesn't think he could do it as Speaker of the House. Sounds familiar. Tom : He's right. ♪ Maybe we offered him the wrong job. ♪ What about the Vice Presidency? ♪ [Siren wails in distance, horn honks] Mrs. Kirkman? I'm sorry. I didn't expect anybody in so late. I hear you've been asking around about Jeffrey Myers. Well, Emily's got a better poker face than I thought. [Sighs] She said it came up in your opposition research. Yeah. So you know we had a relationship, and you know he's in prison. I do. And so does Tom. Every detail. It is not a personal issue for us, so I don't see why it should be a political one. It shouldn't be... except Jeffrey Myers has been telling everyone in his federal prison in Pennsylvania that he's the father of your son. Ma'am? Mrs. Kirkman. ♪ Ma'am, does... does Leo know... that the President might not be his father? ♪ You haven't said a word. What the hell do you want me to say? That you believe me. Of course I believe you. I didn't want to, but yeah, I do. Who else have you told? No one. ♪ Why? What are you thinking? These people, whoever they are, they killed almost every senior member of the federal government and tied up any loose ends before we even knew there were any. So, we need to find out the how and the why... Yes, we do, but we don't know who to trust. So you cannot say anything to anybody. Do you understand me? No one. ♪ [Engine roaring] [Helicopter blades whirring] ♪ Marino : Mr. President. I'm sorry. I had no idea you were here, sir. I wanted to pay my respects to Commander Clarkson. Thank you for your incredible bravery. Just doing my job, sir. You know, Max wasn't even supposed to be in the raid. He was supposed to coordinate the mission off site. But when Denton got injured in the chopper crash, Max took his place to ensure the operation would go as planned. It's because of him none of those kids were hurt... and I get to see the birth of my first child. I should've waited for a better window of opportunity. Don't, sir. Feel guilty? A little part of me does, as well. I also feel honor, respect, because that's what this man deserves. That's how he needs to be remembered. Don't ever question your decision, Mr. President. Because none of us ever did, especially Max. I'll leave you to it, sir. ♪
