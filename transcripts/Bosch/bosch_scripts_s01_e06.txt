 [Thunder rumbles] 
 Man on TV : ...And the manhunt for Raynard Waits widens. 
 Waits, who shot and killed Deputy District Attorney Louis Escobar and wounded an L.A.P.D. Detective, is a suspect in the murder of Armando Uribe, found shot to death... 
 [remote clicks] 
 [Cellphone ringing] 
 Bosch. 
 I want to know what my options are. 
 Why ask me? 
 Because you and I have so much in common. 
 You got two options, asshole. 
 You can wait till we catch you, sit and rot in a 6x10 isolation cell for the next 20 years till they put a needle in your arm. 
 No, I-I-I don't think I care for that. 
 Or you can take that gun you snatched off my colleague, put it in your mouth. 
 I'd choose that, I were you. 
 Right. 
 But you're not. 
 There's a third option. 
 I'm listening. 
 When we do find you, you can reach for a weapon. 
 We'll tell you to put your hands up. 
 You hesitate for a split second, we'll tell you to freeze. 
 You so much as breathe wrong... 
 And you kill me. 
 We'll kill you. 
 Option three. 
 We put you down for good.

 [police radio chatter] 
 [Camera shutter clicks] 
 Billets : Captain Pounds is on his way over. 
 [Bosch scoffs] 
 Better he shouldn't find you here. 
 You're working the bones case, remember? 
 Which is what I was doing when Waits called me. 
 I was at Sam Delacroix's trailer. 
 Found these. 
 [Sighs] 
 Jesus. I wish I hadn't seen that. 
 Uh-huh. 
 Who's the girl? Any idea? 
 His daughter. 
 [Door opens] 
 [Door closes] 
 Did you feed my cat? 
 Fed the cat. 
 What? 
 You said you carried your son's body up the canyon and buried it. 
 That's what happened. 
 My partner carried a dummy the same size as your son up the same hill, broad daylight. Had a hell of a time. 
 And he was sober. 
 You didn't kill Arthur. 
 You're responsible for his death. 
 But somebody else killed him. 
 What? 
 You been jerking off to them all these years and now you can't bear to look? 
 Young woman falls in love with a pretty-boy actor, marries him. 
 Things don't go his way, he starts drinking, beating on her. 
 Eventually she can't take it anymore. 
 She runs off. 
 Leaves him with two children. 
 Guy's soaked with booze, self-pity. 
 Turns to his daughter for comfort. 
 She's 11, 12 years old. 
 Starts molesting her. 
 They call it abuse these days. 
 Let's call it what it is. 
 It's rape. 
 Girl is miserable. 
 Blames it on her little brother and beats the sh1t out of him every day. 
 Even sends him to the hospital with a cracked skull. 
 Daddy covers it up. 
 One day that little boy goes missing. 
 And now daddy's afraid she's finally gone too far. 
 Why you never filed a missing-persons report. 
 Protecting your daughter. 
 The one you've been raping since her mother left. 
 20 years later, dog digs up your boy's bones. 
 You confess to the murder. 
 That's about the size of it. 
 Right? 
 Yeah. 
 That's right. 
 Look... I'm responsible. 
 I'm responsible for every bad thing that happened to my family. 
 I won't let you soothe your conscience by copping to a crime you didn't commit. 
 [Door opens] 
 Did she? 
 Did she do it? 
 [Sighs] 
 I got probable cause up the wazoo. 
 Miss Delacroix? We need to speak to you. 
 Oh, uh, Frank, I apologize. 
 Give me a few minutes. 
 Um, I'll bring you back in. 
 Go get a coffee. 
 Go ahead, Frank. 
 [Door closes] 
 Your father's no longer being charged with your brother's murder. 
 I don't understand. I thought he confessed. 
 He de-confessed. He didn't kill Arthur. 
 Your father thought you killed Arthur. 
 He was going to take the weight because of what he did to you. 
 What he did to... 
 I-I told you my father never laid a hand on me. 
 I found what you were looking for last night. 
 Anything else you didn't tell us? 
 I wanted him to go. 
 Arthur. 
 [Sighs] 
 I blamed him for everything. 
 Mother leaving, what... what my father did to me. 
 Reason you beat him? 
 I hated myself for doing it. 
 But I couldn't stop. I c... 
 [Sighs] 
 When I came home that afternoon, Arthur was in his room packing. 
 I knew he was running away. [Sniffles] 
 I went into my room and closed the door and stayed there until I heard the door close. 
 Until he was gone. [Sniffles] 
 It was a relief. 
 I wanted him to go. 
 If I had stopped him from going that day... 
 ...he'd still be alive. 
 [Sighs] 
 What are you gonna do with those? 
 They're evidence. 
 We keep them. 
 What happens to him? 
 If you'll testify, the D.A. will file charges. 
 We'll arrest him. 
 I don't think I can do that. 
 Do it. It's not too late. 
 Miss Delacroix, put him away. 
 Now what? We put all our money on dad. 
 Nobody carried that body up the hill. 
 Whoever killed Arthur killed him up there. 
 Trent said the neighborhood kids used to play on the hill. 
 So when Arthur ran away, that's where he went. 
 If only we could track down his skateboard pals. 
 His father said a couple of names. 
 Jimmy? Johnny? 
 Johnny. Johnny Stokes. Stokes. 
 I'm on it.

 [Footsteps approach] 
 Billets : Jesus. Harry, what are you doing here? 
 Come here. Take a look at this. 
 The Waits thing. 
 Victims, sightings, cons on possible prior attempts. 
 Waits is all over the map, but nowhere near where he was arrested... 
 Center of the donut... Echo Park. 
 Hmm. 
 It's brilliant, Bosch. 
 I think that even the captain can read a map. 
 I thought you were on your way to Las Vegas. 
 I was. 
 Plate's a little full with these cases. 
 Okay. Take a few days off. 
 Get away from work, decompress. 
 I mean it. It's an order. 
 Waits calls? 
 You call me. I'll call the task force. 
 Quit procrastinating. Hit the road. 
 The thing is, Eleanor and her new husband, they probably got plans for the holidays. 
 Oh, and you'd just be in the way? 
 What I was thinking. 
 Maddie's been home for three months practically next door. 
 Go spend Christmas with your daughter. 
 Don't be such a pussy. 
 Brasher : You always wait till the last minute? 
 I usually wait till after Christmas to do my Christmas shopping. 
 Good. I'm not getting you anything, either. 
 That's a relief. 
 Maddie have pierced ears? 
 Pierced ears? 
 Yeah. She's what? 14? 
 She'll be 15 next month. 
 So? 
 That's a little young, isn't it? 
 Harry, it's not an abortion. 
 It's just pierced ears. 
 I don't know if her ears are pierced. 
 What about a necklace? 
 Um... oh, the pavé heart is sweet. 
 The butterfly. 
 You know what? 
 She used to really like unicorns. 
 Yeah? 
 Yeah. 
 When? When she was 8? 
 I don't know what she likes. 
 I haven't seen her in three years. 
 Listen, Harry. Whatever you get Maddie, she's gonna love it 'cause it's from her dad. 
 You think? 
 I know. I'm a daughter. 
 You know what my niece is really into? 
 Bracelets. 
 Multiple bracelets like those. 
 Okay, pick out a few. 
 Yeah? 
 [Cellphone rings] 
 Gift wrapped, please. 
 Sure. 
 Excuse me. Bosch. 
 Waits : Hey, Harry. 
 It's me. 
 Is this a good time? 
 Where are you, Waits? 
 Um, well, I was in plumbing, but I'm checking out now. 
 I guess I'll have to go somewhere else to find that f*cking goddamn decent shovel. 
 You know, you'd think  they'd have something like that in stock, right? 
 But no. It's just cheap crap. What do you want? Well, I was thinking about our last conversation... a lot, and I just wanted to tell you that I do have other options. And in case you're wondering... I don't steal shovels. I steal souls. You... [phone hangs up] [Cellphone beeps] What's he got there? Christmas lights, batteries. That looks like a sump pump. It's been raining. Water in his basement? Mothballs. Oh, Jesus. Oh, f*ck me. That's Crate's gun. He's calling me there. m*therf*cker. Christmas lights, mothballs, sump pump. What the f*ck kind of list is that? [Camera shutter clicks] [Door opens] How many times you have to be told? Just leaving. You're not part of this investigation, Bosch. Waits called me. Again? You girls going steady? What'd he say? Where the f*ck you going?! Tell me what he said! I'm not part of this investigation. I'll give my report to the lieutenant. [Door opens] Bosch : Jerry? Edgar : John Stokes, 34. Multiple arrests for petty theft, possession of marijuana and meth, drunk and disorderly, trespass, et cetera. No felony convictions. Currently on probation for a shoplift. 34? Puts him two years older than Arthur. Could be our guy. I'll swing by and talk to his probation officer tomorrow. How about now? He's off for the day, Harry. It's after hours. Where are you? Somewhere between Barstow and civilization. [Chuckles] Wish Eleanor and Maddie a merry Christmas for me. Will do. Call me after you talk to Stokes' P.O., yeah? [Cellphone beeps] ♪ I had a dream ♪

[Phone ringing] [Muzak plays] [Speaks Chinese] Harry. Why didn't you let us know you were coming? Well, it's kind of a last-minute thing. [Sighs] Jesus. Some things never change. Well, it's good to see you. You look well. Maddie will be thrilled. Where is she? I stopped by the house. No one was there. She's at a friend's. Isn't it a school night? It's Christmas vacation, Harry. She'll be home at 10:30. 10:30? Isn't that kind of late? 30 seconds in, you're already accusing me of being a bad parent. Sorry. It's not what I meant. I was just looking forward to seeing her tonight. Come by tomorrow. We work late, but she's up early. You look well. Thanks. As do you. Eleanor, we're waiting on you. Harry. Harry. What a nice surprise. God, it's been donkey's years. Good to see you, Reggie. Yeah, I'll be there. It's good to see you, old man. Come by the house, hmm? I will. Thanks. I should get back to the table. Yeah. I am glad to see you. [Door opens] [Door closes] Hey, it's Julia. Leave me a message. [Beep] Hey, it's me. I'm just thinking about you. Hope you're having a good time with your dad. See you in a couple days. Mom left a note you'd be coming. Hey, Maddie. Go ahead. Say it. Say what? You can't believe how big I've grown. Okay. I can't believe it. Why do old people always say that? This is for you. Merry Christmas. Thanks. We'll put it under the tree. Mom and Reggie are still asleep. Wow. Deck the halls. [Chuckles] This is our Dickens' village. It's a family tradition. Every year we add another house. All you're missing is a little toy train. What's in there? Breakfast. You got a kitchen? Follow me. Bosch : You still like bananas, right? Maddie : Uh-huh. This place in L.A. I like to eat, Dupar's, world-class pancakes. Syrup on the bottom. My secret. Any good? It's great. Delicious. What's delicious? Hello, Harry. Good morning, Reggie. How are we today? Very well, sir. Thank you. Harry made my favorite pancakes. Oh. Chocolate chip, hmm? Banana. Ah. Banana. Of course. Harry also made coffee. Ah. Brilliant. A man of many talents. 
 
 Good morning. Good morning. Want a pancake? Hmm. No, thank you. I have to run to CVS and get some eye drops. Had some heavy smokers at the table last night. Got any plans today? Hang out with you. Want to do something fun? Sure. Be right back. You been watching the news from L.A., this serial killer, Raynard Waits? Yeah. We checked it out. No trace of this guy prior to '94. We still don't know yet who the hell he really is. [Sighs] Is this why you came? To pick my brain about Waits? I came to see Maddie and you. Bullshit. Just thought since I was already here... I don't do that anymore. I don't profile. Except when you're playing cards. [Sighs] Just thought you might be interested. Well, I'm not. Okay. I bet you brought the murder books, didn't you? I made copies of relevant pages. Copies? Is it even your case? You're off the reservation, aren't you? Waits keeps contacting me. Got me involved. I put together a travel book. It's in the car. [Keys jingle] [Sighs] Put it under the tree behind the presents. [Engine turns over] Okay. Now, keep your finger outside the trigger guard till you're pointing down range aiming at the target. Okay. Cross your thumbs. That's good. Gives you better control. All right, now center mass. That's where you want to put your front sight. Use your finger pad, not the crook, okay? Okay. Whenever you're ready. [Chuckles] Holy crap. Okay. Not bad. Oh, I didn't get him. It's okay. All right. Now, this time, I want you to shoot a few rounds, okay? But I want you to keep your finger on the trigger between shots, all right? [Sighs] Okay. Okay, let her rip. [Gunshots] [Chuckles] Outstanding. You're a natural. Am I? Do you have any idea how hard it is to do that? This is so much fun. Let's do the zombie target. Okay. So, what's he done? Just wanted to talk to him. Cold case. John Edward Stokes. Checks in on schedule. Passes his drug test, been at the same job for over a year. [Scoffs] Wish they could all be like him. I should be so lucky. Current address? Uh, he was living with a girlfriend. They broke up, so he's been sofa surfing for the past few days looking for a place of his own. I'll give you the work address. So, I wanted to be a veterinarian, but now I think I'm gonna be a cop. Popped that zombie right between the eyes. When they start showing up in L.A., I'm gonna give you a call. I'm being very serious, Harry. I can tell. [Gunshots in distance] You know, mom says you're the best detective she's ever met. She said that? Mm-hmm. Okay. So I've been reading about you on the Internet. Yeah-huh. The trial. They found you guilty. Not exactly. It was a civil trial. Mm-hmm. They ruled against me sort of. Fined me a whole dollar. Oh, well, that's not so bad. Nah. Is it true your mom was a prostitute? She was a good person. She did her best to take care of me. And somebody killed her? Yeah, they did. I wish you could have met your grandmother. You would have loved her. She would have loved you. Harry. Yes, ma'am. When you go back to L.A... Can we Skype? Skype? Is that like Hulu? Jesus, Eleanor, don't be sore. What? Are you anti-gun now? What if I were? You didn't even bother to find out. Okay, sorry. Next time I'll ask. [Sighs] Look, Harry, for Maddie's sake, I'm all for you being in our lives, but not if it's Harry the fun-loving dad and me the disapproving, disciplinarian mom. First time I've ever been accused of being fun-loving. Look at the Waits stuff? You knew I would. And? When I heard the name Raynard Waits, I thought it was an alias. There's this character in medieval French literature, Reynard the fox. Reynard means fox. Anyway, he's sly and selfish, and he uses his cunning to triumph over brute strength. Usually a dull-witted wolf. Puts me the dull-witted wolf. You're a cop, so you symbolize brute strength. So, he taunts and calls you because he's reveling in outwitting you. Convinced he's smarter than we are. That's typical of psychopaths. Anyway, in the stories, he has a castle where he goes to hide, a place where he Waits. So, things he took from the hardware store... The sump pump, the lights... these are all for his lair. What about the mothballs? When I was a kid, my dad used to throw them under the house to get rid of the rats. Okay, so basement or dungeon. Yeah. Now, his familiarity with these folk tales is unusual for an American, so he's probably French or has a French background or studied French in school. Look at this. I was looking into the coroner's report. The other detectives characterize Waits as homosexual, but I don't think that's right. Preys on gay men, prostitutes, hustlers. Yeah, but I don't think he sees himself as gay, or at least he's deeply conflicted. Because look, the two rapes that we know of, they were post-mortem and they were brutal, which means he can only achieve an erection after the satisfaction of that rage. Any idea of the origin of that rage? Well, murderers who exhibit this kind of behavior usually were sexually abused as children, so my guess is he was raped as a boy and what started out as revenge has become a compulsion. The hardware store, jacking of the truck. He's breaking pattern. He's playing his endgame. He likes the risk, the adrenaline rush, the dare. He wants attention, especially yours. But I doubt you're gonna take this guy alive. I don't think he'll let you. Can I bring Taylor to the Kleiners' party? Are we going? Did we RSVP? I didn't, did you? Mnh-mnh. I thought you weren't speaking to Tay. That was last month. I'll call Gina. Reggie : The Lau's flew in last night. Oh, God. Mrs. Lau is a kleptomaniac. No kidding. Eleanor : She knows exactly what she's doing. The last time she was here, she nicked a Rolex from the gift shop. A $30,000 Rolex. What happened to her? Nothing. Mr. Lau lost $300,000 at Pai Gow, so the hotel let her keep it. Cost of doing business. Darling, everybody loves your trifle. You should make that for the Kleiners. I don't know. Gina's always so snarky about my trifle. Would you excuse me for a minute? I just got to make a quick call. [Cellphone ringing] Edgar : Hey, Harry. Jerry. You in Vegas? Yeah. How's Eleanor? Good. And Maddie? All good. Anything new? Waits is lying low. Not a sign. He call you? Must have lost my number. Talk to Stokes' P.O.? Yeah. Yeah, Jerry, you were supposed to call me. He's working at a car wash on Pico. Okay, I'm on my way. This is why I didn't call you. Stay put. It'll keep till you get back. He's not going anywhere. Enjoy Christmas with your family. You know what, Jerry? Would you... Goddamn it. Reggie : It's got pepper in it. Eleanor : Mmm. I'm gonna try this. Mm. Bosch : Something's come up with a case I'm working on. Got to go back to L.A. That's a bit of bad luck. What a shame. You're leaving? I'm sorry. But it's Christmas, and I bought you a present. I can run home and get it. No need. I'll be back on Christmas day. I promise. Can I, uh... oh, no, no, no. Don't be silly. We've got this. Thanks, young man. Harry. Yeah? You promised. I meant it. I'll be back. [Sighs] I got you a present, too, but I didn't have time to wrap it. You need a new phone. Is that a smartphone? Smarter than the one you got. I hope it's not smarter than me. That's very thoughtful. Thanks. Be careful. Always. [Siren wailing in distance] Mr. District Attorney, thank you for coming. Well, I don't have much time. The wife and I have tickets for "The Messiah" at Disney Hall. This Waits fiasco. The district attorney and L.A.P.D. Trading punches on the 6:00 news? Undermines public confidence. And it's not doing anything to help us apprehend Raynard Waits. I agree. Cooperation is always preferable to conflict. Which is why I've refrained from releasing my copy of the video. Your copy? Ahh. I think that video cuts both ways, don't you? Waits' escape while in L.A.P.D. Custody. Well, it certainly shows you ordering Detective Bosch to loosen Waits' handcuffs. And once the shooting starts, the unsympathetic observer might conclude you were... What's the word? ...cowering behind Escobar when Waits fired the fatal shot. What do you want, Irv? You stand a good chance of becoming L.A.'s next mayor. I did until a few days ago. Well, if we catch Waits quickly, you've still got the white West Side. As long as the video doesn't come out... L.A. is a three-piece suit. Black, white, and brown. You need two out of three to get elected mayor in this town. My endorsement would go a long way in the black community. Everyone knows I've been a fierce critic of the current chief. Where is he from originally? Boston? Philly. It's crucial the next chief be a native angeleno, someone from within the department who's risen through the ranks. That would be a wise choice. Enjoy "The Messiah." I understand they have a particularly fine tenor this season. He'll f*ck you if he can. No doubt. That's Stokes. Mank, it's Harry. Hey, Harry. How's it going? Edgar and I are at the car wash. You got a unit can back us up on a witness scoop case he rabbits? Pico and Beverly Glen? Yeah, I'll, uh, I'll call West L.A. I want to keep it off the radar. Work with coppers I know. All right. Uh, I'll send a car. Edge and Brasher. Is that gonna be a problem? No problem. All right. Roger that. New cellphone? Present from my ex. Nice. Didn't know they still made flip phones. Just for guys like me. We brace Stokes up front. You guys cover the back just in case. Edgewood : Lot of these car-wash guys are on the run from La Migra mostly. They make us, could be mayhem. So we don't want them to make us. Keep it simple. Low key. How about weapons? Stokes' record says no guns. We just want to ask him a few questions. No drama. That's Stokes'. Silver Porsche. Yo, 5-0, 5-0! Man : Policía! [Indistinct shouting] John Stokes, L.A.P.D. Want to ask you a few questions. sh1t! Damn it! Bosch : Stop, asshole! Stop! Hey! Stop! Hey! Hey! Damn it! Did you hear what I said?! I told you I just want to ask you some questions. About what? Aah! Oh! You okay, partner? Good. I'm good. Go, go, go. Son of a bitch. Red, red, red. He's going out the back. He took an alleyway! 6-William-21. Officers in foot pursuit, north bound Beverly Glen, Pico, on an ADW on a P.O. suspect. Suspect is male, white, approximately 34 years of age. Requesting backup and airship. [Siren chirps] Jerry. He went in to one of these apartment complexes, north side of the car wash! Go in the garage. He might be looking to boost a ride. [Siren wails] Brasher : Stop right there. What did I say? Stop right there. Stop right there. Don't move. Turn around. Turn around! Hand against the wall! Don't move. I tell you not to move, you don't f*cking move! [Gunshot] [Gasps] Don't move! Don't move! Don't you f*cking move! Don't shoot, man! Don't shoot! Don't move! Don't shoot! Get on the ground. I didn't do it! Get on the f*cking ground. Grab that ground! I didn't do it! Shut your f*cking mouth. I didn't do it, man! [Brasher groans] Ow. Shut up. You hit? It wasn't me. Just breathe. I don't know what happened. You'll be okay. Bullet didn't penetrate the vest. You're okay. [Tires screech] Come on, man. Don't let him kill me. I didn't do anything! Shut the f*ck up! Julia! sh1t! You m*therf*cker! Edge! Edge! Edge! Knock that sh1t off! Edge! Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait! Get him the f*ck out of here. It hurts. sh1t. You're okay. You're okay. Process that area? No. You saw what happened? Some of it. You saw him go for my gun, right? You're in shock. Don't say anything to anyone. Talk to your rep first before you give a statement. You hear me, Julia? Think about how it went down first before you say anything to anyone. Harry, what the hell happened? I'm not sure. You leaving? What about F.I.D.? I'll talk to them at the station. I got to get this asshole to safety. Broke my f*cking rib. Bosch : You're lucky to be alive. If you want to stay alive, you do what I say. I'm gonna put you in a room. You talk to nobody but me, okay? Okay. Let's go. [Engine turns over]
