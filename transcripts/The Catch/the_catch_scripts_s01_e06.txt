 Previously on "The Catch"... 
 Agent Dao is here right now. 
 Ben : And going through your mail at the moment. 
 You can't trust this guy. 
 How well do you know Alice Vaughan? 
 I know her well enough to know that you've been bugging her house. 
 If you ever come anywhere near her again, I will personally see to it that you are deported back to where you came from. 
 Do you want to maybe get a drink? 
 Shawn kind of asked me to dinner. 
 Our payment is now officially past due, so it won't be long before they send someone after us, and when that happens, we have two options... deliver or die. 
 You've taken the words right out of my mouth. 
 I really hope I don't have to kill you. 
 Why'd you leave the family? 
 You were next in line. 
 No, I was never next in line. I'm a woman. 
 Our Benefactor has decided to forgive your payment this month. 
 He needs you to steal a bracelet. 
 The Shives are here. 
 Is every crime syndicate in town after this bracelet? 
 Hello, Ben. 
 Hello, Mickey. 
 I suppose you're looking for this. 
 [Silenced gunshots] 
 Aah! 
 [Tires screech] 
 Get in! 
 [Engine revs] 
 3JRQ158. 
 What's your name? 
 Benjamin Jones. 
 Benjamin Jones. 
 Where is it? Alice, I don't have time for games. 
 If you want your bracelet back, you're going to have to play by my rules from now on. 
 [Cellphone beeps] 
 [Sighs] 
 Margot : There you are! Where have you been? 
 I've been calling you all night. 
 My phone died. 
 I thought you died. 
 What happened? 
 Oh, uh... 
 Mickey Shive's aim isn't what it used to be. 
 Well, are you okay? Let me see. 
 I'm fine. 
 It's just a scratch. 
 Good. 
 Well, did you get the bracelet? 
 I did. 
 I just... I have to shower and change. 
 No, there's no time. We've got a new problem. 
 Whatever it is, it's gonna have to wait. 
 [Laughter] 
 Benji! 
 Rhys. 
 Felicity. 
 Morning. 
 Rhys : Benji! 
 How are ya?! 
 You look well. Bit tired. 
 Ah! Ah! 
 Ooh, what happened here? 
 Uh... 
 Mwah! 
 Did you miss me? 
 [Chuckles] 
 Hello, sis. Mwah. 
 As you can see, my brother's here for a visit. 
 Our Benefactor has come to collect. 
 Right, then. 
 Where's my bracelet? 
 [Cellphone rings] 
 Alice : Why do I have a feeling this is not a social call? 
 Ben : I need that bracelet back. 
 See, you're fine stealing from other people, but when it happens to you, you don't like it. 
 I was forced to steal it to pay off my debt, and if I don't hand it over, if I don't pay off my debt... 
 You're a dead man? 
 I can tell by the way you said that, you don't believe me. 
 I spent a year believing you. 
 Look where that got me. 
 That was the old me. This is the new me. 
 And the new me is gonna get shot in the head if you don't give me the bracelet back. 
 If I give it back, I'm an accessory to a crime. 
 If you keep it, you'll be found guilty of the crime. 
 And let me tell you something... my Benefactor isn't the only one looking for it. 
 Those people shooting at me last night? 
 If they find out you have it, they'll be shooting at you, too. 
 Now you're just trying to scare me. 
 No, I'm trying to terrify you, because you should be terrified, because I'm terrified for you. 
 All right, fine. 
 You want the bracelet so badly? 
 Come and get it. 
 [Cellphone beeps] 
 [Sighs] 
 ♪ ♪ 
 [Whispering] I don't want to bother him, you know. 
 It's... maybe something for later. 
 [Whispering] He's great. 
 But Alice... She's busy, too, and I just don't think that... 
 [Sighs] 
 Yes, we're talking about you. 
 Shawn needs your help. 
 Shawn : It's actually not for me. 
 It's for an army buddy of mine. 
 You were in the Army? 
 The four years after college. 
 Totally. 
 Shawn : She's one of the first female Army Rangers, and she could really use your help. 
 "She"? 
 Captain Nia Brooks, this is Alice Vaughan... 
 Hi. 
 Valerie Anderson... 
 Hello. 
 Shawn : And this is Danny Yoon, the detective I was telling you about, and Sophie. 
 I have heard good things. 
 Oh, he's way too nice to me. 
 [Chuckles] He is annoyingly perfect, isn't he? 
 [Chuckles] 
 We hear congratulations are in order. 
 You're making history. 
 Thank you, but I'm not sure what I'm... 
 Don't let her downplay it. 
 Nia's the first woman ever to join the Rangers... the Army's elite special ops force. 
 Now that the Pentagon's opened up combat roles to women, she'll be among the first to deploy. 
 Which is why there's been backlash. 
 Stupid stuff at first. 
 My gear was stolen, equipment was messed with. 
 But then I started getting threats. 
 What kind of threats? 
 E-mails, notes, photos. 
 Did you report all this? 
 To my commanding officer weeks ago. 
 But then I got this. 
 My dog tags, which had been stolen, along with a killed-in-action letter on official stationary addressed to my parents. 
 That's when I said maybe she should come in and meet you guys. 
 Yeah, but the thing is, if anyone knew I went outside the Army for help... 
 No one will know. 
 We will figure out who's behind this, and we'll make it stop. 
 What you're doing is too important. 
 Thank you. 
 But if you could just find out who this is, I'll take care of it myself. 
 Maybe you can take care of a federal agent for me while you're at it. 
 No, please. Allow me. 
 ♪ ♪ 
 So, where is it? 
 Someplace safe. 
 That sounds unnecessarily mysterious. 
 There were Shives all over the consulate last night. 
 Reps from all the major U.S. syndicates. 
 Armed to the teeth. 
 So I hid the bracelet so if they got to me, they wouldn't be able to get to it. 
 Clever boy. Well done. 
 How's your omelet? 
 Mm, it's fine. 
 You must have worked up quite an appetite. 
 Mmm! 
 That is good. You want to try Felicity's omelet? 
 No, thanks. I've had it. 
 So, what is this bracelet, Rhys? 
 Why is every crook in town after it? 
 'Cause it's worth a bloody fortune. 
 Well, you already have a fortune. 
 Several, including mine. 
 Now, now. 
 Ben's right. 
 Margot : You didn't fly all the way from London for a piece of jewelry. 
 What's it really? 
 All right. 
 The truth? 
 Mm-hmm. 
 I'm not here for the bracelet. 
 I'm not just here for the bracelet. 
 I'm here because Mum sent me. 
 You are not! 
 What? 
 It's true. 
 Since when do you listen to Mum? 
 How can you not? She bangs on and on. 
 The woman never shuts up. 
 About what? 
 About you. About us. 
 She wants us to make peace. 
 I wasn't aware we were at war. 
 No, not officially. 
 So you'll forgive our debt? 
 Yes. I will. 
 The minute you pay me back. 
 And so much for making peace. 
 I did forgive you this month's payment in exchange for the bracelet. 
 Speaking of which... 
 Shall you and me go and retrieve it from its secret hiding place? 
 I think it's safer for you if I go alone, in case anyone's watching me. 
 That's pretty thoughtful of you, Benji. 
 Don't be long. 
 ♪ ♪ 
 [Sighs] 
 I've come to apologize. 
 We're not interested in your apology. 
 Then perhaps this. 
 A peace offering. 
 What are we looking at? 
 A gala at the Larágan Consulate. 
 They had an uninvited guest. 
 Your friend, Christopher Hall. 
 We believe he stole something from the Larágan Prime Minister. 
 What did he steal? 
 This. 
 If we find that bracelet, we'll find Christopher Hall. 
 ♪ ♪ 
 Maybe he is here to make peace. 
 Oh, right, 'cause that's what Rhys does. 
 Wherever he goes, he just makes peace. 
 Why would you believe anything that comes out of his lying mouth? 
 Because I know him. I know when he's lying. 
 See? 
 This is exactly why I had to get you away from him... because the minute the two of you are together, I cease to exist. 
 That's not true. 
 I am partners with you now, not him. 
 Well, make sure he knows that. 
 I know my brother. 
 He's here for more than just a bracelet. 
 So whatever it is, we have to present a united front. 
 He'll try and divide and conquer. 
 He always does. 
 So we can't let him or anything else come between us. 
 Do you promise me? 
 I promise. 
 ♪ ♪ 
 We don't know much about the bracelet... only that every crime syndicate in town seems to be after it. 
 But you think Christopher has it. 
 So what do you want from us? 
 You're the one with all the information. 
 I wanted to share it with you to make it up to you. 
 You think this makes up for bugging my house, invading my privacy? 
 We all have the same goal, Ms. Vaughan. 
 We have very different methods, Agent Dao. 
 So if you'll excuse me... 
 You want to make it up to her? 
 Then don't come back until you catch him. 
 ♪ ♪ 
 Margot : You slept with my brother! 
 I wasn't aware you and I were exclusive. 
 No, we're not. Let's be clear. 
 This is not romantic jealousy you are witnessing. 
 This is disgust. 
 You slept with me, and then you slept with my brother. 
 Technically, I slept with him first. 
 I've been doing that for quite some time. 
 I assumed you knew. 
 How would I know? 
 Given your rather pronounced lesbian tendencies, why would I make that assumption? 
 You sleep with Ben. 
 How do you explain your lesbian tendencies? 
 I prefer not to. 
 Takes all the fun out of them. 
 Did you know he was coming? 
 No, I would have told you. 
 Do you know why he wants this bracelet? 
 He's not said. 
 Can you find out? 
 He thinks I'm his. 
 Right, which is exactly why he might actually tell you. 
 And then you can tell me. 
 What's in it for me? 
 I don't know. 
 What would you like? 
 You are disgusting. 
 I think I'm nice. 
 Hmm. 
 So, both the Army and the media are making Nia the center of attention with these stories. 
 There have been articles for and against her in every major publication. 
 And the stuff on the message boards is out of control. 
 But this was somebody close to her, close enough to steal her dog tags. 
 Someone she went to Ranger school with, someone who washed out? 
 Sophie and I went through a list of the wash-outs. 
 And so far, there's only one of them who's had access to this kind of official stationary. 
 1st Lieutenant Evan Connors. 
 That little bitch is making death threats? 
 I didn't say that, or use those words, but has he ever said anything? 
 No. No, he knows better. 
 What about any other Rangers? 
 The other Rangers are my family now. 
 They've got my back. It isn't them. 
 What about outside the Rangers? 
 The only person I see is Shawn. 
 Shawn? 
 Sullivan, as in Agent Shawn. 
 Wait, so you and Shawn are... 
 No, I thought he was dating you. 
 No, I mean, we've gone out a couple times... 
 I'm sorry. Look, I'm sorry. 
 Was that a secret? 
 No, no. 
 No, it's fine. 
 So, when do I get to have this little chat with Evan Connors? 
 Not yet. Not until we have proof. 
 We'll find this guy, whoever he is. 
 Just... give us a little more time. 
 [Sighs] 
 Alice : We're talking more now than we did when you were Christopher Hall. 
 Ben : Where are you now? 
 On my way to the Larágan Consulate to return the bracelet. 
 Alice, don't do that. 
 Agent Dao is looking for it, too. 
 Dao's the least of my problems right now. 
 Mine, too, at the moment. 
 I'll have to call you back. 
 I assume you're here for this? 
 [Silenced gunshots] 
 [Engine revs, tires screech] 
 [Grunts] 
 Allie, behind you! 
 I'll take that gun and the bracelet. 
 [Engine starts] 
 [Tires screech] 
 Are you all right? Are you hurt? Is your neck okay? 
 I'm fine! I'm fine! 
 How's your neck? 
 They're getting away! 
 Is your neck okay? 
 You're not going after them. 
 Don't tell me what to do. 
 Get in the car or get out of my way! 
 This is my debt! It's my problem! 
 It's my fault I stole the bracelet from you. 
 I am doing this alone. 
 Let me help. 
 I want to help. 
 You want to help me steal a bracelet? 
 I want to help you not die. 
 You don't know anything about these people... who they are or how they work. 
 No, I don't. 
 But I know someone who does. 
 You want to work with Agent Dao? 
 Mm-hmm. 
 Are you absolutely sure? 
 Mm-hmm. 
 [Knock on door] 
 Is he back? 
 Have you heard from him? 
 Not yet. 
 I thought you two were supposed to be partners. 
 We are. 
 When Benji and I were partners, I knew where he was at all times. 
 Well, maybe that's why he's working with me and not with you. 
 [Keyboard clacking] 
 You're in a mood. 
 I have missed you, you know. 
 [Scoffs] You have not. 
 I have. 
 You used to do all the work. 
 I didn't have to do anything. 
 Yeah, it's good to be king. 
 Did you actually think that when Dad died they would put you in charge? 
 I mean, I don't know if you've noticed, darling, but you're kind of a lady. 
 Men don't like taking orders from ladies. 
 Tell that to the Queen. 
 I think Elizabeth knows. 
 The thing is... you act as if you've been exiled. 
 When, in actual fact, you abandoned me, and you took Benji with you. 
 He did have a choice in the matter. 
 Yeah, but I couldn't exactly offer him the same enticements, could I? 
 Not for lack of trying. 
 He is rather straight, isn't he? 
 Bless him. 
 How are things in that department? 
 Fine, thanks. 
 How's about things with you and whatever her name is? 
 Felicity. 
 She's fascinated by the two of you. 
 She tells me you do all your own legwork for every con. 
 Yeah, well, we can't exactly afford staff with the debt you've got us carrying. 
 I keep meaning to ask you. 
 What happened? 
 How come you got no money all of a sudden? 
 You used to be very good at this. 
 I still am! 
 It's not me. It's your precious Benji. 
 Really? 
 Do tell. 
 [Door opens, closes] 
 You're back. 
 [Sighs] I was worried. 
 About you, not the bracelet. 
 Can I have it? 
 I'm sorry. 
 Mickey Shive was waiting for me. 
 What do you think they're gonna do with it? 
 Sell it, of course. 
 Same as me. 
 To whom? 
 Rhys, if you tell us a bit about the bracelet, we can help you recover it. 
 Oh, you're going to. 
 Tell me about Mickey Shive. 
 ♪ ♪ 
 So, what do we know about 1st Lieutenant Evan Connors? 
 He drinks light beer. 
 That's reason enough to sic Nia on him. 
 [Chuckles] 
 [Indistinct conversations] 
 Yeah, I'm gonna have to get back to you on that. 
 You need to turn around and go home. 
 What are you doing here? If anyone sees me with you... 
 You know how we avoid that? By leaving right now. 
 Let's go. 
 He's here, isn't he? 
 I just want to talk to him. 
 Do you want our help or not? 
 There a problem here? 
 No. 
 There's not a problem here. 
 Danny, this is my brother, Brian. 
 Who's this guy? 
 A friend of mine. 
 I'm... 
 All right? Now go back to your friends. 
 I'm fine. 
 Danny : Nia, Nia, Stop! 
 Was this you? 
 [Sighs] 
 Nope. 
 But whoever it was, I'm a fan. 
 What the hell's going on here? 
 Nia, can we go? 
 I carried the same weight as you, ran the same miles as you. 
 I just didn't wash out like you. 
 [Chuckles] 
 You failed twice, same as me. 
 But Sergeant Moore was told he had to graduate at least one woman. 
 So if you're wondering why we all hate you, including Sergeant Moore... 
 You want to talk that way to my sister in front of me, Lieutenant? 
 [Sighs] 
 You sure you want to do that? 
 I can fight my own battles, Brian. 
 You want to find out what kind of soldier I am? 
 Come on. 
 You and me, right now. 
 See? 
 That's the thing about girls... so emotional. 
 You're not worth it. 
 [Dog tags clink] 
 Brian : Nia. 
 Nia! 
 Why would I bother with death threats? 
 You're not even a real soldier. 
 The minute you land overseas, you're gonna die. 
 [Crowd gasps] 
 
 
 
 Hey. 
 What did you do that for? 
 That wasn't for you. 
 That was for me. I hate that guy. 
 You're focusing on Christopher because you want it to be Christopher, but we can't ignore the other two crime families that were there last night. 
 We're watching all of them. 
 If Mickey Shive has the bracelet and tries to move it or sell it, we'll be there when Christopher tries to steal it from them. 
 And if Christopher has the bracelet? 
 We'll be there when they try to take it from him. 
 Will you let me know when and where so I can be there? 
 Of course. 
 Does your hand hurt? 
 No, it's fine. 
 Really? 
 'Cause that's not how you throw a punch. 
 That was a solid punch! 
 No, that is how you break your hand. 
 Come here. Let me show you. 
 Oh, easy! Oh! 
 Oh, I'm sorry. 
 [Chuckling] That is gonna be bad in the morning. 
 Let's put some ice on it.

 Don't touch anything. 
 What's that supposed to be? 
 A battlefield cross for soldiers who die in combat. 
 It's my grave.

 Mickey Shive has a girlfriend. 
 That poor girl. 
 She's a p0rn star, and personal trainer, of course, named Erin Savvy. 
 I love Los Angeles, don't you? 
 Ms. Savvy has an apartment at the Park Plaza, and Shive is there. 
 I'm on my way now. 
 I'll come with you. 
 No, you will not. 
 Mickey Shive is probably armed, definitely dangerous, and you're not going anywhere near him. 
 And as for you, you're not doing yourself any favors with me coming up here trying to get my partner killed. 
 I only came here bec... 
 Now you're interrupting? 
 We want to catch Christopher as much as you do. 
 And we're happy to share information.

 That's him. That's Mickey Shive. 
 Oh, he does look like a proper gangster, doesn't he? 
 [Cellphone dialing] 
 I'm making the call. 
 Oh, I wanted to make the call. 
 It's already dialing. 
 I've practiced my accent and everything. 
 Rhys, this is serious. 
 I know. Give me the phone.

 He's been shot. I think he's dying. 
 Please. Uh, yeah, the Park Plaza, room 701. 
 Oh, my God, there's... there's so much blood. 
 [Cellphone beeps] 
 It's a little theatrical. 
 [Chuckles] 
 [Normal voice] You used to love my theatrics. 
 Yeah, your theatrics got us into a lot of trouble. 
 You used to love trouble. 
 My sister's domesticated you. 
 She sucked all the fun out of you, like some Earl Grey succubus. 
 Just because it's not you and me getting wasted every night, with different women every night... 
 Sometimes the same woman. doesn't mean... 
 At the same time. that I'm not fun. 
 Yeah, but are you happy, Benji? 
 You don't seem very happy to me. 
 Shive's on the move. 
 You didn't answer my question. 
 Well, I think it's called growing up. 
 Oh. 
 You've grown up, have you? 
 I'm trying. 
 [Chuckles] 
 [Siren wailing] 
 [Tires screech] 
 So is that why you left? 
 You know why I left. 
 You made it impossible for her to stay. 
 What? And you and Margot are the same person, are you? 
 You have to do everything she does? 
 Oh, I hate couples like that. 
 You wouldn't even know each other if it weren't for me. 
 I invited you into this family. 
 You were my partner, and she stole you. 
 She didn't steal me.

 It's called the battlefield cross. 
 Oh, my God. 
 The door was open when we got there, but it didn't look forced. 
 So they might have had a key. 
 Or stolen a key and copied it. 
 If they got to her dog tags, could have gotten to her key. 
 Can we check CCTV footage from last night? 
 I did, but you can't see Nia's house from the street. 
 Couldn't have been Evan. I was tailing him all day. 
 Did Nia give you any other suspects? 
 No, but Evan did... he said Nia's C.O. was forced to graduate at least one female Ranger. 
 If only for publicity's sake. 
 What's his name? 
 His name is Sergeant Joshua Moore. 
 I'll see what I can dig up on him. 
 Did you search Nia's house last night? 
 No, I'm headed back there now. 
 I'll come with you? 
 Yeah, sure.

 You could have your old job back, be your own man. 
 What makes you think I'm not my own man? 
 My sister would never allow that. 
 You underestimate her.

 Yeah. 
 So, uh, it was nice meeting you. 
 Nia, check in later? 
 Yeah, I'll walk you out.

 Danny : So, who's Captain Todd Walker? 
 And why is he leaving with all our evidence? 
 When I got out of the shower, Rhys was on the phone speaking Punjabi. 
 He thinks I only speak Hindi. 
 Not that he's ever asked. 
 And what was he saying? 
 Apparently the diamonds in the bracelet came from India 200 years ago before the British walked in and stole everything. 
 So he's selling them back? 
 He's giving them back. 
 That little b*st*rd. 
 He's expanding into India. 
 And Africa and the Middle East. 
 To think Ben and I were just gonna hand him that bracelet. 
 Are you not? 
 Certainly not... not under the terms of our current agreement. 
 This calls for a renegotiation. 
 [Line ringing] 
 Ben : Rhys and I just had the most enlightening talk with Mickey Shive. 
 Do you have the bracelet? 
 Well, there's good news and bad. 
 Mickey gave it to his boss this morning. 
 Emeric Shive is in town? 
 Until tomorrow. 
 Then he's leaving on a private jet. 
 Bound for India, I expect. 
 How did you know? 
 What's the good news? 
 We have until noon tomorrow to figure out a way to steal the bracelet back. 
 Do me a favor. 
 When you get the bracelet, give it to me. 
 I'll give it to Rhys. 
 Rhys : Is that her? 
 Don't tell me you got to check in, as well. 
 Got to go. Come on, before Mickey wakes up. 
 Oh, don't worry about that. 
 Can't have him talking to the cops. 
 Besides, isn't he the one that put a bullet hole in your lovely suit? 
 Can I drive? 
 [Engine starts] 
 We need to work faster. 
 This is Mickey Shive? 
 Two shots fired with ballistics I've only ever seen once... in Paris... a woman named Nathalie Duchamp. 
 And you think Shive and this woman were killed by... 
 Christopher Hall. 
 [Door closes] 
 Hey, what's up? 
 Dao's here. Mickey Shive is dead. 
 How? 
 What happened? 
 Shot twice in the back. 
 Dao thinks Christopher did it. 
 I have to call you back. 
 What are you doing here? 
 Allie. 
 You made me an accessory to murder. 
 Dao gave me Shive's location. 
 I gave it to you, and now Shive is dead. 
 This is why I didn't want you involved. 
 The people I work for, the people I work with are killers. 
 And you're not? 
 You know I'm not. 
 You act like I'm just supposed to believe you. 
 After everything you've done to me, every lie you've told... 
 Did you at least get the bracelet back? 
 No. 
 Shive gave it to his boss, who's on a flight to India tomorrow, so I have from now until then to get it back. 
 But you can't. 
 Dao is watching him, waiting for you to make your move. 
 I can't not. My boss needs that bracelet.

 Or for me. 
 I know you don't believe a word I'm saying, but I am sorry, Allie.

 What if it were possible for Dao to get his bracelet and you to get yours? 
 There's only one bracelet. 
 Just like there's only one Maria Kreyn?

 Hello? 
 Hey. Where are you? 
 I'm on my way. 
 What's gonig on? 
 Army Rangers go through regular performance reviews, right? 
 For promotions? 
 Okay. 
 So Nia's friend Todd got reviewed and promoted six months early. 
 By whom? 
 Nia's C.O., the guy Evan mentioned in the bar... 
 Sergeant Joshua Moore. 
 Do you want me to tell her or... 
 No, I'll do it. 
 Thanks, Soph. 
 Yep. 
 [Sighs] 
 What'd she say? 
 I'm sorry, but you're wrong. 
 Nia... 
 No, Shawn. 
 You've met them both. It isn't Todd or Sergeant Moore. 
 Nia, I can't even imagine how difficult this is for you. 
 I got through Ranger school with Todd. 
 He'd do anything for me. I'd do anything for him. 
 I hope that's true. 
 And Sergeant Moore wasn't forced to pass me. 
 I got through the course like everyone else. 
 We're not implying that you didn't. 
 Look... I appreciate you guys trying to help. 
 I do, but...

 You're wrong. 
 I'm sorry I wasted your time.

 Tell him everything... about coming here, about us. 
 You hired private detectives? 
 You saw what happened to my house, that stuff on my wall. 
 You're not supposed to go outside on stuff like this. 
 You can't tell anyone. Okay? 
 [Clink] 
 After you leave, he'll run straight to Sergeant Moore or whoever's giving him orders. 
 We got a big problem. 
 He'll want to calm him down, so he'll agree to meet.

 Major Brooks, you don't get to talk right now. 
 You don't get to tell me what to do, Ms. Vaughan. 
 Shut up, Brian! 
 Does Dad know about this? 
 You gonna tell him? 
 You sent me death threats. 
 Nia. 
 You destroyed my house. 
 I was trying to protect you. 
 How? 
 By turning my friends against me? 
 First Todd, and then my C.O.?! 
 That's what I'm trying to tell you. 
 You have no friends! 
 Listen, I love you. I respect you. 
 You are the strongest, bravest woman I know. 
 But you're a woman. 
 And there are Rangers out there who hate you because of that, who do not have your back. 
 And if they don't have your back in combat, you're dead. 
 And I don't want you to die. 
 There are other ways you can serve. 
 All I ever wanted to be is a Ranger. 
 Like Dad. 
 Like you. 
 You are a Ranger. 
 Ms. Vaughan... 
 It's okay, Alice. 
 It's not okay. I'm sorry.

 Margot. 
 We had a deal. 
 Yes, we had a deal to steal the bracelet from the Larágan Consulate in exchange for our missed payment, but now... 
 We had a deal for the bracelet. 
 If you want us to steal it again, then you will forgive our debt in full. 
 It's a small price to pay for all of India, Africa, and the Middle East. 
 Who told you about that? 
 Do we have a deal? 
 Because, in 40 minutes, that bracelet is on its way to India without you. 
 I am going to need this in writing.
