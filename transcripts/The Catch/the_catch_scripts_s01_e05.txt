 Previously on "The Catch"... 
 Alice : So he's officially Michael Thorne? 
 He just opened three new credit cards. 
 How does your partner feel about working with the FBI on this one? 
 We're private investigators. We have no secrets. 
 Right. 
 We need a confession. 
 Michael Thorne. 
 Why did you target me? 
 I didn't target you. The people I work with did. 
 Ask him to meet you privately. 
 I'll be in touch. 
 Our payment is now officially past due. 
 We have two options... deliver or... [Door closes] die. 
 We'd like to request an extension. 
 I'm not the messenger. 
 I'm the collector. 
 Oh, I really hope I don't have to kill you. 
 How close are you two to getting the money? 
 Friday 5:00, Grand Park. 
 Just keep your men outside until I get my confession. 
 I was going to tell you everything. 
 What we had was real. 
 And I love you. 
 All agents, move in.

 Someone like...? 
 Someone like Agent Dao. 
 Whoa. Leave it with me. 
 Okay. 
 Allie. 
 William Etheridge. 
 Oh, right. 
 Sorry. 
 William : Friend of mine took them. 
 Saw Renée at a restaurant, was about to say hi, and then... saw her take his hand. 
 So instead of saying hi, he took photos and sent them to you? 
 If she's having an affair, I'd rather know. 
 Have you shown them to Renée? 
 No. 
 [Sighs] I need to know the truth first. 
 So she can't lie to me anymore. 
 I need to know who he is, how long this has been going on, if there have been others... I need to know everything. 
 William, here's the thing. We would love to help, but... 
 Renée's our client. 
 We worked on her campaign. 
 Can you not just find out who this man is for me? 
 Please. 
 Let us talk about it internally, and we'll get back to you. 
 Okay? 
 Okay. Thank you. 
 Has Renée ever cheated before? 
 Not according to William. 
 Married 11 years, two kids. 
 He's a superintendent at a school. 
 She's a Los Angeles City Attorney. 
 Does sound a little too good to be true. 
 She is the real deal. 
 We worked for her when she was running for City Attorney. 
 We were doing oppo research, vetting staffers. 
 Technically, we still work for her. 
 That was three years ago. 
 Sophie : I could take a quick look at her credit cards and phone records. 
 I could do a little light surveillance. 
 No, you guys. We have to talk to Renée. 
 Are you gonna tell her about these? 
 What are we gonna tell her? 
 She has a re-election campaign coming up. 
 We have to at least find out if we're still working for her. 
 I'll call and set up a meeting. 
 Okay. 
 Margot : No, darling. 
 You have nothing to worry about.

 You find anything on my phone? 
 Not yet. 
 Really? Because... 
 Because I can't find your phone. 
 What? Sophie. 
 It was in my pocket, and... 
 That phone has every call, every text that he and I... 
 I know it's... it's here. It has to be here. 
 I'll find it. 
 Valerie : Looking for this? 
 ♪ ♪ 
 Val... 
 Multiple calls from masked numbers. 
 I can explain. 
 And then these texts, also masked. 
 I was going to tell you. 
 Hey, I'm just... I'm trying to wrap my head around this, and I'm trying to understand how you could ever see this man again. 
 How? 
 I've been working with Agent Dao to try to catch Christopher. 
 What? 
 And I didn't tell you because, um... 
 Because I knew that you would try to talk me out of it. 
 I knew it. 
 And I will not be talked out of this, Val. 
 I will not. 
 I need this. 
 I need to understand why this happened to me. 
 And if it happened to you, I promise you that you would need it, too. 
 So... may I have my phone back, please? 
 Guys, Renée Etheridge is here. 
 [Door closes] 
 I must tell you, I'm disappointed. 
 I'd heard such lovely things about you both. 
 Yes, well... 
 Uh, we had a few setbacks. 
 So you thought you'd skip town? 
 Where's the common courtesy? 
 Where's the honor among thieves? 
 Historically, there isn't any. 
 That's where you're wrong. 
 You see, if you'd come to me and said, "Felicity, we're not going to be able to make our payment. 
 You'll have to kill us." 
 I'd have told you that our Benefactor has decided to forgive your payment this month. 
 Really? 
 Why would he do that? 
 Because, in spite of your rather poor showing this afternoon, you're worth more to him alive than you are dead. 
 What does that mean, exactly? 
 Well, he's got a job for you. 
 [Inhales] 
 No. 
 Margot. 
 Just kill me now. I mean it. 
 I am not going to work for him. 
 What kind of job? 
 Benjamin. 
 A simple snatch and grab. 
 He needs you to steal a bracelet. 
 Alice : We know you haven't announced any re-election plans, but... 
 Valerie : Should we start vetting any potential opponents? 
 Honestly, I haven't had time to think of it. 
 I mean, we are working on new gun-violence initiatives this year, immigration reform, public health and safety issues. 
 And, um, how's your non-work life? 
 How's William doing? 
 He's great. 
 We're both great. 
 We're actually doing better than ever. 
 Mm. 
 How was the meeting with Renée? 
 Brief but interesting. 
 She had a meeting at City Hall. 
 And she lied to us. 
 She didn't lie. 
 Things with William are "better than ever"? 
 Maybe they are to her. 
 Either way, she lied to you guys. 
 She is not on her way to City Hall. 
 What did you do? 
 Did you clone her phone? 
 A little. 
 Where's she going? 
 Let's find out. 
 Alice and I have things to discuss. 
 No, we don't. 
 May I ask... 
 How did you take Alice's phone? 
 It was in my pocket. 
 I'm wearing tight pants. 
 I'm that good. 
 Ben : Looks like an early 20th century armband. 
 Got to be 50 karats. 
 Diamond beading, oval and round-cut diamonds, worth... at least $12 million. 
 Last seen dangling off the wrist of Carla Velasquez, Prime Minister of Larágo, a Caribbean republic opening its L.A. consulate this very week. 
 This is gonna be challenging. 
 Why do you say that? 
 Because she never takes it off. 
 And she and her husband are surrounded by a minimum of four armed guards at all times. 
 Now, the Prime Minister is hosting a dinner reception later this week. 
 The consulate will be a fortress. 
 So the first thing we'll need are invitations to the party. 
 Once we're inside, what are you thinking? 
 Standard lift. 
 Really? With the guards? 
 Isolate and distract. 
 I&D four guards? That's a two-man reroute. 
 There's no Reggie. 
 She'll have to help. 
 But I'm a killer, not a thief. 
 Well, nobody's perfect. 
 [Car engine revs] 
 Where is she going? 
 Danny : Mm, wherever it is, she doesn't plan to stay long. 
 She has a staff meeting she confirmed via e-mail. 
 Any other telltale e-mails? 
 Nothing even remotely adultery-ish. 
 So... is there any way that you want to talk about what's going on with you and Val? 
 Uh, it's complicated. 
 No, it's not. 
 She'll forgive you. 
 I did. 
 For what? 
 For going after Christopher without us. 
 So, you knew about me and Christopher? 
 And about you and Dao. I've known the whole time. 
 Why didn't you tell me? 
 I figured if you wanted me to know, you would have told me. 
 Danny... 
 Hold up. 
 Here we go. 
 Any idea who he is? 
 I've never seen him before. 
 [Camera shutter clicking] 
 Was I that obvious... about Christopher? 
 Not at all. I was that jealous. 
 You asked Sophie to look into the Maria Kreyn forgeries. 
 You know about that, too? 
 I take it the one in the museum's a fake? 
 At least until I can figure out how to put the one in my bedroom back in the museum. 
 Okay, now we're making movies. 
 Doesn't look like love. 
 Doesn't even look like "like." 
 Sophie : His name is Tony Ellis. 
 He owns and operates a multinational called Ellis Pacific. 
 He also owns all the politicians to whose campaigns he's contributed. 
 Renée may not be having an affair with Ellis, but she's definitely been in bed with him since she got elected City Attorney. 
 How do we not know about this guy? 
 He hates publicity. 
 But he's actually everywhere, developing properties all over L.A., and his contracts always get rubber-stamped. 
 By the City Attorney's office. 
 So he bought Renée in the last election. 
 No. That's the weird thing. 
 Renée's never taken a penny from this guy. 
 So what does he have on her? 
 Can we hack him and find out? 
 I wouldn't know where to begin. 
 All his companies are shells of shells. 
 We need to hack Tony Ellis himself. 
 So let's get him to come in and take a meeting. 
 Maybe he needs a security company. 
 Yeah. 
 He already has a security company. 
 Isn't there anything we can do to make him think he needs a new one?

 Look at that. 
 I'm a lady. 
 Margot : You are one of the British Royal Family's courtesy appointments to the ambassadorship, but you haven't attended a diplomatic event in years. 
 Typical fallen-gentry work ethic. 
 Margot : You will be attending as Dr. Kenneth Jacobson. 
 Your work to eradicate malaria has earned you invitations to every international soiree in the northern hemisphere. 
 It's just a pity you're so often traveling. 
 Ah, yes. And you are? 
 [American accent] Dorothy Parcell of the California Parcells. 
 My family's interested in opening a natural-gas shipping terminal in the Port of "Lor-ay-go." 
 We do not talk like that here. 
 Yes, you do. 
 [Normal voice] Where are we on security? 
 The consulate itself contracts with a private security firm. 
 Not Alice Vaughan's, I hope? 
 Who's Alice Vaughan? 
 A company called Quanta Systems. 
 Four tactically trained officers for the building perimeter, and an additional six control officers. 
 All armed, I assume. 
 Will we be armed? 
 No. 
 There'll be metal detectors at the door. 
 Will we have backup of any kind? 
 We will have each other. 
 See, if you two were back with the syndicate, we'd have backup and guns stashed all over the consulate in ceiling tiles and potted plants. 
 I admit there were advantages to working for the company. 
 Yeah, well, hard work builds character. 
 What an American way of putting it. 
 All right. On that note... 
 Where are you going? 
 Dr. Jacobson has to pick up his tuxedo. 
 Lady Beatrice, Ms. Parcell. 
 [Door opens] 
 I have to say, this whole do-it-yourself process is a bit sweaty. 
 Don't you miss just being handed a dossier and popping in to pull the trigger? 
 What's wrong with getting sweaty? 
 [Keypad clicking] 
 [Clears throat] 
 I'm here because I received word this afternoon that my security firm has been hacked. 
 I'm so sorry to hear that. 
 Thank you. 
 And you're looking to... replace them? 
 Not exactly. 
 I'm looking for the individuals responsible for the hack. 
 Well, we can certainly begin looking into that for you. 
 I appreciate that. But there's no need. 
 I think I know who's responsible. 
 I can't prove it, of course. 
 The work was clean. 
 Impressive. 
 The hackers didn't take anything, as if they were just trying to, uh, get my attention. 
 And now they have it. 
 So if there's another company out there showing off, hacking me, threatening my business in any way, I'll simply buy it. 
 Or make it go away. 
 So, I wanted to come by and meet you both. 
 Put faces with the names. 
 Anderson. 
 Vaughan. 
 Because perhaps we will be doing business in the future. 
 Don't forget this. 
 I think I hate that man. 
 Something tells me the feeling is mutual. 
 [Elevator dings] 
 Please tell me the microdot is not still on your finger. 
 All clean. 
 The microdot's in play. I'm accessing his phone. 
 Which gives us... 
 E-mails, contacts, phone calls. 
 He'll find out. 
 He knew about the hack. 
 How? 
 I got the feeling he knows everything about everyone. 
 Then, by tomorrow morning, we'll know everything, too.

 Ms. Vaughan? It's Jules Dao. 
 Is this gonna become a thing... you showing up here at night?

 Yeah, I know. 
 And going through your mail at the moment. 
 I'm telling you, you can't trust this guy. 
 The reason he showed up at our date yesterday... 
 It was not a date. 
 Is because he's been eavesdropping on you. 
 He bugged your house.

 I didn't see anything when I came in, but I'll look again. 
 It's tiny. You can't see it unless you're looking for it. 
 I see what you mean. 
 He must not have delivered it yet. 
 What are you going to do?

 You were saying? 
 I was hoping we could resume our partnership. 
 Have you heard from Christopher again? 
 Actually, I did. 
 You did? 
 We agreed to meet at Disney Hall yesterday. 
 But then he never showed. 
 I'm sorry I didn't tell you. 
 But after what happened in Grand Park... 
 I can't say I blame you.

 [Knock on door] 
 What's wrong? 
 We found out how Tony Ellis is controlling Renée. 
 How? What does he have on her? 
 Nothing. He has stuff on her husband, William. 
 Renée : He was 21. It was his first teaching job. 
 The girl was 17. 
 Renée. 
 They thought they were in love. 
 Her parents paid to make the whole thing go away, which it did. 
 Until Tony Ellis told me about it. 
 And then he threatened to expose William if I didn't push his contracts through. 
 And my husband is a good man. 
 I don't need you to make excuses for me. 
 Will, I... 
 I can't believe you knew all this time. 
 It doesn't matter. 
 Why didn't you say anything? 
 What would have been the point? 
 Renée didn't tell you because she knew if you found out you would do the right thing and come forward. 
 You would lose your job with the school board for a mistake you made when you were 21. 
 Yeah, well, maybe I should lose my job. 
 Honey. 
 I let Tony Ellis manipulate me. 
 He blackmailed you, which is illegal. 
 And which we can use to take him down without exposing William and without you having to resign. 
 How? 
 We need you to set up another meeting with Tony Ellis. 
 It looks like you were right, Mr. Ellis. 
 We will be doing business after all. 
 You were right, Mr. Ellis. 
 My firm was responsible for pointing out the vulnerabilities in your security company. 
 All of which have been corrected. 
 We were also responsible for putting a microdot on your cell, giving us access to the microphone, camera, and your location for the past 24 hours. 
 We know where you've been, who you've seen, what you've said... all your secrets. 
 And we've recorded them all to make sure that you never threaten William or Renée Etheridge again. 
 [Chuckles] 
 Are you not taking me seriously, Mr. Ellis? 
 No, I am. I... 
 I'm just thinking about what I'm going to do to you and your firm to get even. 
 We just made a powerful new enemy. 
 Tony Ellis is going to hit us back.

 Especially when he finds out Renée's bringing all his city contracts up for review.

 Ms. Anderson. What brings you here? 
 Work, unfortunately. 
 Alice was supposed to meet a suspect, and I didn't want her going alone, so I showed up, and the guy cancelled. 
 And yet you stayed. 
 I am not about to let good bourbon go to waste.

 And you? 
 Are you working?

 Sure. Let's go with that.

 What's wrong? 
 The Shives are here. 
 And the Gullahorns. 
 Are there any legitimate guests at this party? 
 Who are these people? 
 The competition. 
 Is every crime syndicate in town after this bracelet? 
 So you weren't sent here to kill us. 
 You're here to lead us on a suicide mission. 
 Listen, I'm here, too. 
 My life is on the line here, too. 
 Shall we proceed with the plan? 
 I'm sure they all have a plan. 
 But did they do their homework? 
 Do they know the song that Carla and Diego danced to at their wedding? 
 [Tango music plays] 
 You're on. 
 They're all watching us. 
 That's the point. 
 They're watching us, not the bracelet. 
 For once, I'm glad there are no guns. 
 Unless they got here early and hid them. 
 Find out. 
 Ready?

 So... 
 How well do you know Alice Vaughan? 
 Are you serious? 
 You're gonna sit here with a beautiful woman in this dress and you're gonna ask her about another woman? 
 Is that how they do it in France, because... 
 My apologies. 
 You are a very beautiful woman. 
 Nope. No, no, no. 
 Too late for that. 
 You want to know how well I know Alice Vaughan? 
 I know her well enough to know the two of you have been investigating Christopher behind my back. 
 I know her well enough to know that you've been bugging her house. 
 And that if you ever come anywhere near her again, I will personally see to it that you are deported back to where you came from, so you can enjoy all the fine French whiskey you can drink.

 Don't you need, uh, tweezers or something to take the bullet out? 
 It's a flesh wound. 
 There's no bullet in there. 
 You sure? 
 You've never been shot before? 
 That surprises me. 
 Why? Have you? 
 Of course. 
 Really? 
 Where? 
 Hold still. 
 Aah! 
 It looks like I'm not the only one who kept secrets this year. 
 It's not the same thing. 
 So, who were they... the people shooting at us? 
 Uh... 
 You promised to tell me the truth. 
 The Shives and the Gullahorns... two of the biggest crime syndicates in the country. 
 And which one do you work for? 
 Neither. We work independently. 
 "We"? There's more of you? 
 Who's "we"? 
 Allie. 
 My partner. 
 "Partner." 
 I've worked with her for 15 years. 
 Mm. 
 And were the two of you together when we were together? 
 No. 
 I was with you. 
 Only you. 
 And how did your partner feel about that? 
 She didn't like it. 
 Which is why I'm trying to keep you away from her, away from all this. 
 And me being here doesn't help. 
 Where are you going? 
 It's not safe for you if I'm here. 
 You're not going anywhere. 
 Not until you tell me everything. 
 I've told you everything. 
 You haven't told me anything. 
 I don't even know your real name. 
 What's your name? 
 It doesn't matter. 
 It does to me. 
 Tell me your name.
