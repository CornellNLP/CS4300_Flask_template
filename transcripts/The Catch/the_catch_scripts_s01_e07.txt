 My son Joey is missing. 
 He ran away. 
 Uh, nanny found this on his pillow this morning. 
 I called the police, and they're doing everything that they can, but... 
 Alice : "I can't do this anymore." 
 What does that mean? 
 Living with me. 
 He doesn't want to live with me anymore. 
 And why is that? 
 Because he blames me for the divorce. 
 He doesn't understand why he can't see his mom anymore. 
 He can't see his mom at all? 
 They have supervised visits twice a month. 
 Why supervised? 
 The court deemed her unfit. 
 She's bipolar, manic-depressive. 
 Was she abusive to Joey? 
 No, but her shrink said that her condition could lead to violence, so the judge gave me sole custody. 
 Do you think Joey's with her? 
 No, I-I went over there, which was a mistake because now she's losing her mind... what's left of it. 
 I called our friends, Joey's friends, the school.

 Vincent Singh is the C.E.O. and co-founder of one of the biggest video-game studios in the country. 
 Forbes has his net worth at just under $400 million. 
 Sophie : Vincent met Karen 12 years ago when she started as one of his programmers and ended up getting pregnant with Joey a few months later. 
 But Vincent refused to marry Karen unless she signed a prenup, which Karen finally signed, but only after Joey was born. 
 I looked into the custody case, and Vincent was right. 
 Karen has no history of violence. 
 I did find some prescriptions for antidepressants and anti-anxiety meds. 
 Half the people I know are on those meds. 
 I am. 
 I am. 
 You are? 
 You are? 
 How are you not? 
 I went to Joey's school, and his teachers confirmed that he's been acting out, talking back. 
 Joey's not a happy kid. 
 So he wanted to disappear. 
 Vincent gave us access to Joey's wireless account, which tracks GPS data, and the last known location of the phone was here in Union Park. 
 When? 
 Last night at 10:17. 
 So he's been missing for over 12 hours. 
 How did Vincent not know that? 
 The nanny put Joey to bed at 9:00. 
 Vincent didn't get back from the office till midnight, which, according to the nanny, is not unusual. 
 So Joey never even sees his dad. 
 Or his mom. 
 No wonder he ran away. 
 Is there any chance the phone is still in the park? 
 It's a long shot, but... 
 Can't hurt to look. 
 Sophie : According to the map, the last place Joey used his phone was in this area. 
 What's an 11-year-old kid doing out here at 10:00 at night? 
 Trying to get his dad's attention. 
 Even that didn't work. 
 He called us and went back to the office. 
 Did you ever run away from home? 
 Well, if you ask my mom, she'd say that's what I'm doing right now. 
 Where is home? 
 Northfield, Vermont. Population 6,207. 
 Did you... ever run away from home? 
 No, that would require having a home to run away from.

 It's not just vineyards. 
 Daddy also owns hotels and restaurants. 
 Yeah, we know all this. 
 Don't forget I'm the one who landed us this whale. 
 Spotted the whale. 
 We still have to land him. 
 Now, our Teddy is his father's leading sales rep, but, by all accounts, is a bit of an idiot. 
 He drives ridiculous cars, dates models, drinks incessantly...

 And he gambles.

 Now, he's only in town for 48 hours. 
 He's meeting hotels, retailers, restaurants. 
 Looking for the most exclusive game in town.

 Couldn't help but notice the logo on your briefcase. 
 Is there a game happening in this hotel? 
 And I will refuse to tell him anything... 
 I'm looking for Mr. McCaulley. 
 Thank you. 
 Which will make him just curious enough to follow me into the restaurant, where I'll be meeting Billy McCaulley, an underground Hollywood high roller, who will ask to see what I'm carrying before he surrenders his cash to join our little game, at which point, Seavers will come to you. 
 Teddy : Buy you another?

 Joey wants this. 
 He's miserable with his father. 
 Vincent has never been there for Joey. 
 Then why did he sue for sole custody? 
 Because of the money. 
 My son was a business decision. 
 His accountant showed him a spreadsheet that said it would be cheaper to keep Joey than to pay me alimony and child support. 
 But Vincent has plenty of money. 
 Yes, because that's all he cares about... money, winning. 
 His whole life is video games. 
 That is the maturity level we're dealing with... mind-set. 
 That's why I divorced him. 
 He claims that he divorced you, that you were suffering from bipolar disorder from manic depression. 
 He paid my psychiatrist to get up on the stand and say that my condition could lead to violent behavior. 
 He paid off our nanny, Joey's teacher, all of these people, to get up on the stand and testify against me. 
 If he bribed witnesses, we can take action against him, but you still have to tell us where Joey is.

 Volunteer families hide the kids, move them from house to house, city to city.

 You just doubled his chip stack and short-circuited my feed. 
 I can't control the game anymore. 
 I still don't understand why we don't just club this idiot over the head and take his $3 million. 
 Why?

 Well, that was an extremely fortunate turn of events, although I'm guessing luck had very little to do with it. 
 Oh, it turns out Rhys was right. 
 It's all about good tailoring. 
 Ah. 
 That's not bad.

 That's also what I call a way-too-long con.
