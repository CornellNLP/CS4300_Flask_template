Mm, I would rather be on the water with Gabe. Oh, get out of here. I see you walk into the station with your lunch box and not much else to do. Yeah, I like it that way. That's why I moved out here. Remember? Well, maybe. But I know you love the smell of napalm in the morning. Movie reference. [chuckles] You've never lived through a murder investigation, have you? I've never lived through nothing. Not like you. Oh, that's a good thing. Yeah, but what's the point of being a cop if nothing's ever gonna happen, you know? I mean, you know, there was the thing with the bear, but other than that, nothing. I don't know, you know, sometimes I just kind of lie awake just thinking, you know, just... is this what it's gonna be? Forever? Just waiting for nothing? I mean, all I'm looking for is just... Meaning and purpose? Yes. That's it. Meaning and purpose. Well, you know, solving a triple homicide can help with that. You, uh, think something was in here? Or someone.

He was our informant, okay? So you're covering up evidence to protect a dead source? No. To protect his wife. Why? She next in line to be flipped? She's my sister. The Vascovis find out that Chris was informing, they're gonna kill her, Helen, and her baby. Charlie, let's get this tarp. Who was in the trunk of this car? I don't know. Chris died before he could tell us. But someone did get away? So we need to get on that. Helen, there's a bigger picture here, so just back off, leave it to the FBI. Kamilah, there's a murder suspect possibly walking around out there, and you guys are just gonna sit on it? None of this matters to me until I get my sister out.

Hey, my dad's inside. Do you want me to take you to him? No, it's okay. I'm here to talk to you. Were you at his cabin yesterday? No. I don't jump there anymore. Oh, no? Why not? [stammering] Well, it gets... you know, it gets way too muddy this time of year. Really? Well, that's weird. I found some tire tracks in the mud, and I thought maybe they were from your bike. No. No?

Did you see anything that I should know about? Anyone suspicious? No. No? You didn't hear anything when you were riding around up by your dad's cabin? I can't hear anything with my helmet on. Well, that must be nice tuning everything out. Yeah, I guess. You should be careful, though. I hear you got a big race coming up. ♪ ♪ [car door clicks open and thuds shut] [engine turns over] Ugh!

Please, no. Please. Please just let me go and see the judge. Please. I promise I will come right back, but if I don't, they will take Jake away from... Shh. Do you know what it's like to lose a child? No. No? No, I just lost my husband. I can't lose my baby. Please, just... Perhaps if you do, you'll be more motivated to find my drugs. Okay? Now come on.

Wow. He's dead. What? Then who are we seeing? It's a dance at Dunbrooke's. They play George on vinyl. Of course. I love this town. [laughing] [door rattles open] [laughing] Philip. Mm. Hey, Philip. Hey. I thought we should open up the table. Oh, okay. Thank you, Philip. The cards, babe? Yes. [clears throat] Seven-card stud. Uh, actually, Philip plays Texas Hold'em. Ah, I don't really know how to play that. Oh, that's okay. I can play your game. I'll figure it out. You sure? Yeah. Hey, that's a cool camera. Where'd you get that? Borrowed it. Really? Is the school lending out electronics now? Uh, no, it was a trade with this kid in my class for my jacket. I like that. Bartering. Old-school. Okay. I will be the big blind. [dark music] And you will all feel my wrath. Promises, promises. [laughs] Mm-hmm. Let's see here. [turkeys gobbling] [phone buzzing] [pounding] You want to know something? I've got to finish this, Rose. It's just... you know my dad. "Turkey shoot's tomorrow, boy. Better have all these signs up." But it's so tacky. Yeah, but it's tradition. Old people standing around shooting birds? Yeah, I mean, they've been doing it for 100 years. They're not gonna stop now. Why do you care? I don't care. Mm? I don't care. Look. You don't even know! Why do you care? [laughing] You don't even know. It's just, like, that's how they've been getting people ready to go to war here. Hmm. Yeah. Huh? You remember how I said I wanted us to wait? Yeah. I... I remember. Yeah? I don't think I want to anymore. [laughs nervously] Why not? [laughs] Well, you know, you've just been so patient with me. [laughs] Yeah. Mm-hmm. [belt buckle clinks] [giggling] Mm-hmm. And a lot of other guys wouldn't be that cool. They wouldn't? No, they wouldn't. [giggles] [phone buzzing] Oh, sh1t. Oh... Oh, damn it, Rose, I... I'm really sorry. I... My dad, he's about to go "Full Metal Jacket" on my ass. I got to get to the range right now and finish this up. I'm sorry. Got to go. See you, Philip. Bye. Bye. Everything okay, babe? No. I got three dead bodies, one strand of hair, and no witnesses. I mean just now, with Philip. What? Poker in my office... [sighs] Did you know that was my favorite time with you? Come on. It's a half hour once a week. Yeah, it's not about the time; it's that I found a man who knows to make that time, just us, huh? Am I evil for wanting to keep it like that? Just a little. [chuckles] No. You'll feel different once Philip opens up to you. Opens up? The kid's not even worn the boots we bought him. He's a great kid. Yes, he is. But something's going on with him. Yeah. He's adjusting to a whole new life right in the middle of high school; it's a lot. Okay. But still, the last couple of days, he can barely look at me. He's all jittery like he's hiding something. He's a teenager, babe, not a perp. Okay. You're probably right. Probably. Probably. [desk scraping] [grunts] What the hell is this? This is how partners sit. See it in the movies all the time. Okay. You know you have to earn it if you want to sit across from me. Okay. How about a 15-year-old girl reported missing this week? Dark hair, red tips? That, I don't know. Well, then why are we talking about it? Check this out. So I find the missing persons report in the database, right? Mm-hmm. But when I click on the link, shows up blank. No name, no photo, nothing. What do you think about that? I think someone's trying very hard to keep us off this case. Mm-hmm. So why are those FBI dickheads shutting us out? Because they can. Now, why would a 15-year-old girl be in some drug dealer's trunk? Come. Don't touch me. Don't touch me. Get off me! 
 
 Papa. Bella. Come. Come in. Come. Come. [water rushing] Did you bring the file? What do you want from a missing child report anyway? I just have to find out if she had dark hair with red tips. Okay, so you did bring the file. What's it gonna take for me to get to look at it? They took my sister's kid away. She missed her court hearing, and unless she has a first-class excuse for the judge, her kid stays in the system. But what does it have to do with me? If you tell the judge she was up here with you being interviewed for the quarry case... You mean the one I was supposed to leave her out of? Her husband's dead. I would really like to help you, but I'm not gonna perjure myself. Not even for intel that's gonna blow your case wide open? Okay. Give me the file. If it leads anywhere, I'll do it. [dramatic music] ♪ ♪ If I go through with this, it's gonna cost you more than just this one file. Understood. ♪ ♪ Mithat Milonkovic? Yeah, that son of a bitch is about to become the biggest heroin supplier in the Valley. ♪ ♪ [eerie music] ♪ ♪ Please call me. I love you. Call me. [door clicks open] [sighs] Bella? Why did you run away from school? Me and a friend, we went into the city... And who is this friend? It's nobody. He's not nobody, Bella. He is a pedophile. No. Yeah. I love you, Bella. I care for you. Why you shame me with an old man? What spell he has put on you? Stop. Bella, this is phone you use to call him. No! Not another word from you. Okay? No more! [pounds on door] [motorcycle motor droning] What? No. You said you wouldn't tell Helen. I wasn't going to, but then I... But what? Huh? Did you even read my texts? The guy looked right at me, and then he didn't even follow me when I got off the bus. I hit him really hard. He probably can't even remember what you look like. Maybe. Or maybe he wasn't after me because he was after Tommy. What? He doesn't even know Tommy. Tommy borrowed my jacket, the one that I was wearing that night, and maybe that's what he remembers. What if he thinks that Tommy is me? Are you insane? If I'm insane, then how come Tommy hasn't texted me back all day? Because he doesn't like you. You're just overthinking it, all right? We just need to chill. I just don't want anything to happen to Tommy because of us, because we didn't say anything. Nothing's gonna happen. He's probably off just hooking up with Tracy somewhere. You said you weren't gonna tell. No, no, no... You promised. No, we should've told Helen right when this happened. You promised! You... Please, Philip, don't... don't tell. [melancholy music] ♪ ♪ [indistinct chatter] ♪ ♪ [doorbell rings and buzzes] Mr. Milonkovic, I'm Sheriff Helen Torrance. I was wondering if I could speak with you for a minute. Are you aware your daughter's been reported missing from her boarding school? She's 15. She is wild. It's not the first time. We have evidence that she might have been in the trunk of a car at a crime scene. Bella? No. When was the last time you saw her? [sighs] She only calls me when she needs money. Have a good day, Sheriff. I'm looking for a killer, Mr. Milonkovic. Is there anything you're not telling me? Why? Because I'm not crying? It does not mean I do not care about my daughter. Well, that may be, but you don't seem very concerned. Do you have any kids? No, not really. Then you don't know. It's not about me. I would never let anything happen to my Bella. Good day. [pop song ringtone plays] Is that Bella's phone? Is that Bella's phone? Mr. Milonkovic. [phone beeps] Is that you, you freak? I will find you.

You want me to be. [laughs] Screw you. You know what? If that killer finds me, this time, I'm gonna... [bang] Bash his skull in. Right, okay, tough guy. Too bad he's not looking for us. Oh, yeah, watch out, Tommy. He's coming for you. What? He's... I'm just kidding. It was... it was a joke. I'm just... Mm. Ugh. [groans] I'm kidding. It was a joke. Come on. It's all right. He's gonna be fine. [laughing] It was a joke. [siren blares] Wait... oh, sh1t. [siren blaring] What, what, what, what... [siren blares] Many teenagers become defiant when you threaten them, or tune you out when you give them lectures. Trust must be established for your teen to feel comfortable opening up to you. Why... why did you kiss me earlier? What? Because you wanted to, or because you didn't want me to tell? I'm not supposed to like you this way. Sheriff, we got to talk, right now! Bo, calm down. I'm here. The boys are inside... Oh... oh, sh1t. What do you want me to say? I'll say whatever you want. We can't talk, right, if we're even more wasted? Is that hand sanitizer? No, no, no, don't do that. Drink this. Drink this. No, no, no, no. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Put it down. Are you serious? Uh-huh. [indistinct chatter] Oh, my God. Okay, so who has the fake ID?

Yeah, we'll talk about that first thing tomorrow. Come on, now. [groans] Dad. [exhales deeply] I'm not gonna lecture you right now. She wants to. Yeah. I really want to, but that's not how you establish trust, so I'm going to listen. So you want to tell us what happened? [heaves] Okay. Okay. [Philip coughing] Helen? Can you give us a minute, Tony? No, Helen, it's urgent. I'm serious. You okay? Oh, yeah, I got this. Okay. All right. Got it out of you? [foreboding music] ♪ ♪

And then at Tommy's house, they were all... [sighs] Laughing inside, and I just wanted to walk away so bad. Oh, babe, I'm so sorry. [groans] Oh, no. Not your back. Oh, yeah. [groans] Don't move. Give it to me. Okay. All right. Yeah. It's really gonna be an epidemic up here, this heroin? I don't know. It looks that way. Oh, right there, babe. Oh, yeah, that's the spot. We got to make sure we steer Philip clear of all that. I hope it's not too late. What do you mean? Tommy Lombart. He was wearing Philip's jacket when we found him. That's his friend, right? The one he bartered with? Camera for the jacket? So he says. Hey, you don't think Philip's involved in all this, do you? No, no, of course not. Gabe, I've seen this so many times with kids you least expect it. And I spent time in Tommy's room.
