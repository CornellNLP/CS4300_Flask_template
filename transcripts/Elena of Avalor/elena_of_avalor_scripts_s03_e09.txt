 *ELENA OF AVALOR* Season 03 Episode 09 Episode Title: "Sugar Rush" 
 "Sugar Rush." 
 At 8 o'clock, you discuss Avalor's traffic problem. 
 At 8:20, you approve the location of the new statues, and then, at 9:05... Ooh! Ooh! 
 ...you meet with three merchant companies. 
 That's not so bad. 
 Oh, I'm sorry. 13. 
 13?! 
 And then from 10... Armando. 
 Do you have any time scheduled for me to take a breath? 
 Breath, breath, breath. 
 Nope. But I can pencil it in. 
 Ugh! How am I supposed to get through this entire scroll today? 
 Well, there's one way. 
 I'm sorry, Princess, but now that Chancellor Esteban is gone... 
 All of his duties have fallen to me. 
 On the positive side, this is a slow day. 
 Slow day?! 
 Well, leisurely. 
 Wait till you see what's lined up for tomorrow. 
 Oh, Princess, you know what happens when your emotions get too strong. 
 Your dress lights up and... 
 Look out! 
 Here comes the feely-magic! 
 Oh! My precious pearls! 
 Now what am I going to clutch? 
 Sorry about that. 
 At least she stayed in her frame. 
 This time. 
 There you are, mijita! 
 Are you ready for our weekly game of Conquian? 
 Sorry, abuela. I'm swamped with work. 
 No matter how busy you are, you should always make time for familia. 
 Armando, please change the schedule. 
 Move Conquian to Thursday. 
 Bumping to Thursday. 
 I've been bumped? 
 Hmm mmm... 
 Introducing the Hydro-Gondola! 
 By using Avalor's waterfalls, we can power a transportation system that will help everyone get around the city. 
 No more traffic. 
 Huh! 
 You're a genius, Isa. 
 Well, I guess I didn't need to ask King Joaquín to come show us how he made Cariza's gondola system. 
 Aah! 
 But, since he's already on his way, it would be rude to cancel last minute. 
 Ohhhh! 
 I need to reinforce the grips and recalculate the counterweight. 
 Princess Elena, it's time for your next meeting. 
 Oh, uh, sorry, Armando, but I have to help Isa weigh the counters. 
 The counterweight? 
 That's what I said. 
 I better clear your schedule. 
 I'll do it! 
 All clear! 
 Mmm, delicioso. 
 So, Elena, Isabel, how was your day? 
 The main support struts need to be constructed someplace with optimum stability. 
 Well, let's look at our options. 
 Oh, we had a great day, abuela. 
 Thank you so much for asking, abuela. 
 Farsight! 
 What about this clearing by the bridge? 
 Hmm. That would take maximum advantage... Turn that thing off! 
 Aah! Oh! 
 No scepter at the dinner table! 
 This is family time. 
 Sorry, abuela. 
 When I was a girl, familia always came first. 
 We all worked and played and ate together. 
 We weren't royal, but we were rich in love. 
 My abuelos were the finest chocolate-makers in Avalor. 
 Their shop was called La. Vida Dulce. 
 People would travel from around the world just to get a taste. 
 What I was saying, the clearing by the bridge would be the best place to put the Hydro-Gondola. 
 You were saying... about the, uh, people... 
 Wouldn't it be nice if we had something like that? 
 Something we could do together, just us girls? 
 Uh... 
 Why not reopen La. Vida Dulce? 
 It is just sitting there all closed up. 
 You are right, mi amor! 
 We should do it. 
 Ooooh, exciting! What do you two think? 
 Yeah, the optimal proximity... 
 Mijitas! 
 Right! Armando, can we fit in what abuela said for tomorrow? 
 I'm afraid tomorrow is completely booked. 
 Check again! 
 Eh heh! Look at that. 
 We just had a cancellation. 
 Perfect, then it's settled. 
 La. Vida Dulce is open for business! 
 Yay! 
 What's La. Vida Dulce? 
 No idea. 
 Now, the secret to delicious chocolate is in the mixing. 
 Turn and fold gently. 
 You've been turning and folding gently for a while now. 
 How long until we're sitting and eating happily? 
 Flo! 
 Oh, like I was the only one thinking it. 
 It takes time to do things right. 
 We want people to taste the care and love that went into making the chocolate. 
 That's the I. Vida Dulce way. 
 I remember spending all day making chocolate with mi familia. 
 Then, after closing time, we would go to Castillo Park and feed the leftover nuts to the squirrels. 
 Well, don't you worry. 
 I'll take care of any leftover anything. 
 Well, now we place the mold in the cold closet until it hardens. 
 What are we making next? 
 Honey hazelnut clusters. 
 Ay, no! 
 I forgot the hazelnuts! 
 I can go pick some up. 
 Gracias, mijita, but I better get them. 
 They need to be just the right kind. 
 Why don't you two make another batch of these while I'm gone? 
 Princess! King Joaquín and Princess Caterina are here! 
 Aah! 
 King Joaquín is here already? 
 They weren't supposed to arrive until this afternoon. 
 Should I tell them to come back later? 
 What? No. Uh... 
 Show them the Hydro-Gondola we built on the terrace, a-a-and tell them we'll be there soon. 
 Yes, Your Highness. 
 Why don't we go now? 
 Because abuela can't open the store without chocolates. 
 But it took us all morning to make one batch. 
 Well, then we'll just have to pick up the pace. 
 Ignite! 
 Snack time? 
 Soon.

 I'm back! 
 What happened? 
 The Carizans showed up early for a meeting, and they're waiting for us to get back to the palace. 
 Gotta run! But what about our chocolates? 
 Well, we already made a whole day's worth. 
 So quickly? 
 But I thought we were going to do this together. 
 And we will. Later. 
 Isa, why don't you stay here? 
 But I designed the Hydro-Gondola. 
 I know, but I think abuela could use some company. 
 Okay. Here. 
 Ah, a gift for the Carizans. Good thinking, Flo. 
 Actually, I was thinking about a snack for me, but, yeah, sure, just give 'em away. Swell. 
 Hello. 
 And goodbye. 
 Ooh! Whoo! 
 Wowie-wow! 
 Hey! Ow! 
 Who put that wall there? 
 And there? And there? 
 And there? And there? 
 Now attach the counterweight to the bull wheel. 
 Wow. Very impressive. 
 Elena! I, uh... am making a few tweaks to your Hydro-Gondola. 
 I hope you don't mind. 
 Not at all. 
 We just have a few questions. 
 Yes, we do. 
 What is the... elevational apex of... Of your proposed aerial track? 
 Oh. I, uh... Let me just check. 
 423 feet above sea level. 
 Yup. That sounds about right. 
 And, uh, what is the estimated longitudinal, uh... 
 Span. 
 Span... ha ha, yes... That you hope to achieve? 
 That's um... uh... 
 Um... 
 I calculate better in nature. 
 Elena, what's happening?! 
 Oh, um, I gotta go! But, Elena! 
 Here! It's a welcome gift! 
 Ooh! Avaloran chocolate. 
 Ooh! Hey! Oh. 
 Excuse me. Sorry. 
 Gracias, enjoy your chocolates. 
 Elena, you're back! 
 Uh, actually, I just came to borrow Isabel for a bit. 
 But I thought... I know, I know, but I'm in way over my head. 
 I need Isa's help with all this gondola stuff, and I'm barely keeping it together as it is. 
 For the good of the kingdom. 
 Whoa! 
 Hi, Isabel, you're gonna love our gondola's speed regulator when you see it in action. It's so fast! 
 Uh... why are you talking like that? 
 We also rigged up an entire track for a demonstration! 
 Let's show 'em! 
 Whoo-hoo! 
 Whoa-ho! Yes! 
 Ha ha ha! 
 No, stop! 
 Aaaah! 
 Oh! Okay. 
 Calm down, Elena. 
 Baby Jaquins, baby Jaquins, baby Jaquins. 
 Baby Jaquins. 
 Ohh! Whew! 
 We need to add a support strut and recalibrate the line tension, but don't worry, we're on it! 
 Uh, what she said. 
 Wait! You don't need to build the whole thing now! 
 Wait! 
 Zuzo! 
 Hiya, Princess. 
 I don't know what's going on! 
 I got nervous, and my New Magic kicked in, but when I calmed down, the statues re-statued themselves, but Joaquín and Cat are still acting weird. 
 Wait! 
 Slow down! 
 Well, that is peculiar. 
 What's this? 
 Oh, I made them chocolates as a gift. 
 
 
 
 Huh, mmm... Uh-huh. 
 And how were you feeling when you made the chocolates? 
 In a hurry to get back here. 
 Aha! 
 If you were feeling really frantic while you were baking, it might've triggered your magic, which got into the chocolates, and then got into them. 
 Cat, stop! 
 Uh-oh. I need to stop abuela from selling any more chocolates! 
 You're welcome. 
 Wait for me! 
 Whoo! 
 Closed! 
 Our chocolates can't cause any more problems now. 
 Abuela? 
 Abuela? 
 Hmm. Where'd she go? 
 And why is everything packed up? 
 Because there's no familia chocolate shop without the familia. 
 The only reason she reopened La. Vida Dulce was to spend time with us. 
 And we left her all alone. 
 We hurt her feelings. 
 No, this is all on me, Isa. 
 I've had so much to do, I forgot the one thing that matters more than all the royal business in the world. 
 We have to find her. 
 Huh, hazelnuts. 
 I think I have an idea where she went! 
 Mind if we join you? 
 Are you sure you can squeeze me in? 
 When I was a little girl, all we had was the chocolate shop. 
 So there was nowhere else to be but together. 
 But you have a kingdom to run, mijita. 
 Even more so with Esteban gone. 
 After all that's happened with him, the shop was my way of keeping us together. 
 But I was foolish to try and relive the old days. 
 I just don't want to lose what's left of my familia. 
 You'll never lose us, abuela. 
 And I was the one who was foolish for not making more time for you and Isa and abuelo. 
 Nothing is more important than familia. 
 Especially now. 
 I love you, abuela. 
 Me, too. 
 Ay, with this much sweetness, who needs chocolate? 
 The chocolate. 
 Um, abuela... 
 There may have been something wrong with the batch Isa and I made. 
 Well, I'm not surprised, the way you were rushing. 
 No, I mean really wrong. 
 I was in such a hurry, my New Magic got into the chocolates. 
 And now everyone who ate them is running around Avalor super-fast. 
 And we have no idea how to fix it. 
 Well, maybe if you make a new batch the right way, slowly and calmly, your magic will create chocolates that return them to normal. 
 That sounds like it could actually work. 
 Your abuelita has some good ideas if you take the time to listen. 
 They're all yours, pequeños. 
 We've got some baking to do! 
 My abuela was a wizard in the kitchen. 
 The whisk was her tamborita, this was her spell. 
 ♪ Chocolate, oh so sweet ♪ 
 ♪ Chocolate, what a treat ♪ 
 ♪ Sugar with some powdered cocoa ♪ 
 ♪ Piece by piece, poco a poco ♪ 
 ♪ Mix it, stir it, fabuloso ♪ 
 ♪ Bake it, cool it, qué sabroso ♪ 
 ♪ Chocolate, oh so sweet ♪ 
 ♪ Chocolate, what a treat ♪ 
 Look! 
 Let's hope it's the right kind of magic. 
 We'll have to wait until they cool. 
 They're ready. 
 Oh! Oh! 
 What is it with all these walls?! 
 Aah aah! Ooh! 
 Flo must've eaten the chocolate, too! 
 Here, eat this. 
 What?! More chocolate?! 
 Happy to! 
 Whew! Maybe I'll take a break from chocolates for a little while. 
 Maybe... 
 Looks like it's the right kind of magic. 
 Now we just have to find everyone else who ate them. 
 Come and get 'em! 
 Free La. Vida Dulce chocolates! 
 Oh! Thanks! 
 Ah, feels so good to stop running. 
 Doesn't it? 
 Maybe you can help me pass out the rest to anyone who's rushing around, too. 
 Sure thing. 
 Free chocolates! Free... Oh! 
 King Joaquín and Cat are this way! 
 Maybe you two should give them the chocolate. 
 What? Why? 
 I can't tell them why this all happened. 
 It's too embarrassing. 
 How so? 
 What am I supposed to say, that-that I have a mysterious power that gets out of hand when I can't control my emotions? 
 I'm the crown princess. 
 I always need to be in control. 
 Or at least people need to think that. 
 Mijita, no one is perfect, not even royalty. 
 King Joaquín will understand. 
 Hey, everyone! 
 Who wants some more Avaloran chocolate? 
 Yes, please! 
 Ohh! 
 I don't understand why I was rushing around. 
 I do. 
 Joaquín, I have a confession to make. 
 The reason you were in such a hurry was... 
 my magic got into the chocolate I gave you. 
 A little while back, I fell into a well of magical crystals, and it gave me, uh, unusual powers. 
 What kind of powers? 
 Well, whenever I feel really strong emotions, something magical happens. 
 And-and-and I never know what it's going to be. 
 I'm trying to get a handle on it, but I'm not quite there yet. 
 I'm sorry. 
 There's no need to apologize, Elena. 
 In fact, I have a confession of my own. 
 Really? 
 I don't know the first thing about gondolas. 
 Caterina is the expert, but I felt like I needed to be, too, because I'm king. 
 The truth is, I don't know anything about weighing counters. 
 Counterweights. Counterweights. 
 Right! Right! 
 So perhaps we should delegate this to our Official Gondola Project Supervisors? 
 Supervisors? Us? 
 I can't think of anyone more qualified. 
 Besides, that'll free up my schedule for a very important appointment I can't miss. 
 Take that, mijita. 
 Hmm. 
 The Hydro-Gondola turned out great, Isa. 
 Thanks, but it's supposed to go 17.5% faster. 
 What's the rush? 
 This way, everyone can enjoy the beautiful view. 
 And the company. 
 And the winning.
