 *ELENA OF AVALOR* Season 03 Episode 08 Episode Title: "Captain Mateo" 
 Previously, on Elena of Avalor. 
 What happened to you? 
 Oh, not much. I fell in a magic well. 
 And check it out: sparkly shoes, even more sparkly dress, and a super-charged scepter. 
 Whenever you feel a big emotion, big magic's gonna happen. 
 Well, we captured Carla and Victor. 
 What about Esteban? 
 He escaped with Ash. 
 My dear, this is a map to Takaína... 
 The source of all Maruvian magic. 
 New plan. 
 We're going to Takaína. 
 "Captain Mateo." 
 Thanks again for coming to the Grand Council meeting, Mateo. 
 Of course. There's a lot to fill them in on. 
 And, you know, if your emotions run high... 
 You're worried I might get upset and bring something to life again? 
 Mm-hmm. Hey! 
 You brought me to life, and I am awesome, if I do say so myself. 
 Ha. And I do. 
 So do I, Flo. 
 Now, what you should be worrying about is that evil wizard, Ash. 
 I mean, sure, you caught two out of three and decorated your garden with one of them. 
 But Ash is still out there, traipsing around Avalor with that terrible traitor cousin of yours! 
 Mmm! 
 Esteban! 
 Mmm! 
 Oh! Whoa! 
 Um, Elena! Ow! 
 Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no! 
 Whee! 
 Was it something I said? 
 Good morning, Princess Elena. 
 Aah! Get out of here! Now! 
 I beg your... Ohh! 
 Aah! Aah! My hat! 
 Just breathe, Elena. 
 Inhale and exhale. 
 Think calming thoughts. 
 A day at the beach, fresh pan dulce. 
 Great, now I'm angry and hungry! 
 Whoo-hoo! 
 Mami's song! 
 ♪ Yesterday I fell into a slumber ♪ 
 ♪ And dreamt the whole night through ♪ 
 ♪ Of a land of golden beaches ♪ 
 ♪ 'Neath a sky of brilliant blue ♪ Llévaluq! 
 Well done, wizard. 
 Psh! I wouldn't say that. 
 I guess I still have to work on keeping my emotions in check, so my magic doesn't get out of control. 
 No way, that was fun! Again! Again! 
 Look over here! Clear over here! 
 All clear, sir! 
 Over this way! 
 Shh! I'm not seeing anyone! 
 Keep searching! 
 Huh?! 
 All clear! 
 Now what is the fastest way to Takaína? 
 You'll have to figure that out on your own. 
 Valiente and I are leaving Avalor. 
 I see. 
 And what is your plan exactly? 
 There are guards combing every inch of this kingdom. 
 And what will you fight them off with? Your charm? 
 You'll never make it without me and my magic. 
 Hmm. Yes, well, we will take our chances. 
 Right, Valiente? 
 Valiente? 
 As I was saying, the fastest way to Takaína is that way. 
 Mm-hmm. 
 But how do you intend to get past all those guards? 
 Oh, I will simply give them someplace else to look. 
 Pesari! 
 Now, follow me. 
 Ooh! 
 Watch your step. 
 Before we begin, I'd like to thank Doña Paloma for joining the Grand Council. 
 Your experience as a businesswoman and former Magister of Trade will be invaluable. 
 Yes, it will. 
 Now, Gabe, where are we on Ash? 
 My guards are doing sweeps of the jungle as we speak. 
 I've set up a perimeter here, here, and here. 
 I'm sorry, but why is he still in charge of this operation? 
 I beg your pardon. 
 Because Gabe is the Captain of the Royal Guard. 
 And he has failed time and time again. 
 The Delgados all escaped from his custody, and the only reason Victor and Carla were caught was because one of them turned to stone and the other gave up. 
 The way to catch a powerful malvago like Ash is to use magic to fight magic! 
 What exactly are you saying? 
 I'm saying Mateo should be named the new Captain of the Royal Guard. 
 Me?! Him?! 
 Well, it's not that funny. 
 Yeah, it is. 
 Oh, Mateo in charge. 
 I mean, Doña does makes a good point. 
 You need magic to fight magic. 
 Maybe it's about time a wizard was calling the shots.

 Your Highness. 
 I guess it's time to vote then. 
 All in favor of making Mateo Captain of the Guard? 
 Looks like it's up to you, Elena. 
 Gabe, wait! 
 Why'd I think there was another door in here? 
 Please, if you'll just listen. 
 You're not leaving this room until we talk! 
 I have nothing more to say! 
 I'll seal it if I have to! 
 Aah! 
 What was that? 
 I don't know. 
 One second I was thinking about keeping you from walking out the door, and the next... whoosh... 
 Crystals shot out of my scepter. 
 Aah! 
 How am I supposed to beat magic crystals? 
 That's exactly my point, Gabe. 
 We need magic to defeat Ash. 
 But we also need you. 
 We have to work together. Can you do that? 
 I can try. 
 It's just I worked so hard to become Captain. 
 I know you did. 
 I guess I let my emotions get the best of me. 
 I'm sorry. 
 Hey, I get it. 
 You're talking to the girl whose dress lights up and makes things float when she's angry. 
 You win. 
 So, how are we going to...? Window. 
 A good soldier always has a Plan B. 
 Good morning, soldiers. 
 You might know me as your Royal Wizard. 
 Okay, then. Ahem! 
 Ash came this close to obtaining the magic of the Maruvians' crystal forge. 
 Yeah! This close! 
 Heh. Ahem. 
 I'm certain she'll head back to get another shot at its magic. 
 Another shot! 
 So we'll march west to Takaína. 
 Marching west! 
 Um, what are you doing? 
 Oh, uh, uh... Ahem! 
 Private Higgins, personal aide, at your service, Captain! 
 Well, can you be at my service... over there? 
 Standing over there, Captain. 
 As I was saying, we'll march west... 
 Make that north. 
 My men just found fresh tracks in the jungle leading north. 
 Atten-hut! 
 Right face! 
 Actually, I was just saying we're moving west. 
 Um, west face! 
 Wait! What'd he say? 
 Who is this guy? It's left face. 
 The direction we're not going. 
 Right face. 
 Trust me. 
 Ash is going back to the crystal forge. 
 If you found tracks going another way, she probably conjured them up to fool us. 
 Ahem! Left! 
 Right! Left! 
 Guys, I know where Ash is! Look. 
 Farsight! 
 That's Pueblo del Oro, the Noblin village. 
 Exactly. Which means she's heading west. 
 You hear that? West. 
 Esteban. 
 You know, I actually had second thoughts about exiling him from Avalor? 
 Those doubts are gone now. 
 Give me a moment. 
 I don't want my "new magic" kicking in. 
 Okay, I'm good. 
 We have to leave right now if we're going to beat them there. 
 Let's go! 
 Marchy time! 
 Huh? What? 
 Did he just say "marchy"? 
 What's with these guys? 
 They're waiting for an official command. 
 Didn't I just give one? 
 Forward march! 
 I knew that. 
 I knew that. 
 Okay, the entrance to Takaína is directly underneath Tepet Muul. 
 So let's set up a perimeter around the entire mountain with lookouts on the pyramids here, here, and here. 
 Oh, perimeter-shmemimeter. There's no time for that. 
 We have to make time. 
 Strategic planning is crucial. 
 And if we stop to plan, Ash will be doing backflips into the magical forge before we even get there. 
 Over there! 
 Halt! 
 Boqato! 
 I don't have a clear shot! 
 Out of the way! 
 I'll save you, Captain! 
 Vetzi... aah! 
 Whoa! 
 Go! 
 We have to catch them, Elena! 
 Gabe, stay here with the guards! 
 They'll just get in the way. 
 Elena and I will take it from here. 
 What?! You need us. Elena? 
 It's his decision, Gabe. He gave an order. 
 Stand down, men. 
 Contali! 
 Ohh! Aah! 
 I said I would bring you here. 
 But you will not hurt Elena. 
 I will do as I please! 
 Go after Ash! I'll catch up! 
 Vetzi! 
 Look out! Cahua! 
 Ecatuul! 
 
 
 
 Oh! Whoa! 
 Oh! Aah! 
 Whoa! 
 Did you really think you could beat me twice? 
 Blaze! 
 Put the tamborita down. 
 Elena. I did not want any of this to happen. 
 I only escaped to avoid being sent to that... that island. 
 I never meant for you to get hurt. Ever! 
 Just like you never meant for my parents to get hurt? 
 No, I didn't, I... 
 I've had enough of your lies! 
 Aah! Aah! Whaa! 
 Aah! Whoa! Aah! 
 Ohh! 
 Vet... ziiii! 
 Contali! 
 Elena! You need to control your magic! 
 ♪ The breeze rustled in the trees ♪ 
 ♪ The sun shimmered on the morning shore ♪ Aah! Whoa! 
 Aaaah! 
 Huh? 
 Not him, too! 
 It's my turn! 
 We have to get out of here! Move! 
 Where...? 
 Noooooo! 
 Huh? 
 You fool! You teleported us out of the forge! 
 What has happened to me? 
 What was supposed to happen to me! 
 You got the power of Takaína! 
 Mmm! 
 O Captain! My Captain! You're back! 
 Mateo? Where's Elena? 
 Esteban's magical now, and somehow he teleported everyone, and I have no idea where they are! 
 I do. 
 We need to help her. 
 Oh, so it's "we" now? 
 You don't think we'll just get in the way? 
 How was I supposed to know Elena's magic would go wild and Esteban would become magical? 
 That's the whole point. 
 You don't know, so you plan for every possibility. 
 Which is exactly why I deployed back-up. 
 Hey, you never ordered me not to do that. 
 You're good. 
 A Royal Guard always has a Plan B. 
 Okay, wizard. 
 You take the squad and intercept Ash and Esteban. 
 I'll head off Elena. 
 Got it. Then let's move out! 
 Huh! 
 Hyah! 
 Gabe! 
 You have to stop this. 
 ♪ May you always know the love ♪ 
 ♪ That shines from deep inside ♪ 
 ♪ In your darkest hour it will be your guide ♪ 
 ♪ May its golden rays light your nights and days ♪ 
 ♪ And fill your heart to overflow ♪ 
 ♪ With love always ♪ Oh! Thanks, Gabe. 
 Now let's stop Ash and Esteban. 
 Vetzi! 
 Cahua! 
 There are too many of them! 
 We have to get out of here! 
 Cahua! Blaze! 
 Ohh! 
 Not again! 
 Surrender now! 
 Quick! Use your staff like before! 
 Ohh! 
 Bang it like you mean it! 
 Huh? Huh? 
 Where'd they go? 
 Quick! Grid search, squad formation! Move out! 
 I'll post guards in front of the forge, in case they come back. 
 I've got a better idea. 
 Seal it! 
 Whoa! 
 Nothing can get through that crystal. 
 Believe me, I've tried. 
 What do we do now? 
 We can't go back to Takaína until we're more prepared. 
 More prepared? More prepared how? 
 You'll see. 
 Zopilote. 
 I offer you my most humble apologies for betraying you and beg your forgiveness. 
 Ash? Yaah! 
 Why should I forgive you? 
 I'm proud of you. 
 But I stole your tamborita. 
 Which is exactly the kind of ruthless action I'd expect from my prized pupil. 
 Uh, where is my tamborita? 
 I solved the puzzle map! 
 Uh-huh. And my tamborita? 
 Princess Elena destroyed it. 
 But I found Takaína. 
 So that means you have the power of the crystal forge now? 
 Eh, not exactly. 
 He got it. 
 Huh! Ohh! 
 It has been a very long time since I have seen such little raw talent. 
 Hmm! But, I cannot let such great magic go to waste. 
 We have to train him in dark magic. 
 What?! 
 And by we, you mean me. 
 Pardon me, but do I get a say in this? 
 No. No. 
 Alrighty, then. Dark magic it is. 
 I will train him on one condition. 
 From now on, you will remember who is the master. 
 I will, Master Zopilote. 
 Then let us depart. 
 Our enemies know this place. 
 And we must find a new home. 
 Preferably one indoors, if you don't mind. 
 Before we begin, I'd just like to say... 
 Why is he talking? 
 That Doña Paloma was right. 
 Please, continue. 
 I understand why you put Mateo in charge of this mission. 
 We do need magic to fight magic. 
 But we also need strategy, careful planning, and military know-how. 
 I agree. We need both. 
 Which is why I'd like to call for another vote. 
 All in favor of naming Mateo de Alva, advisor to the Royal Guard and restoring Gabriel Nuñez to Captain, raise your hands. 
 Oh! All right. 
 The motion passes. 
 You are hereby reinstated, Captain Nuñez. 
 Thank you. 
 I know I have to do a better job. 
 I'll say. 
 And I will. I promise. 
 It was an honor serving you, Captain. 
 And you, Cap... Ow! 
 We'll work on that. 
 Right now, we have a few villains to chase down. 
 Elena, you coming with? 
 Actually, I was thinking you two should handle this one. 
 Really? Yeah. 
 Until I have my new powers under control. 
 Well, what's the hold-up? 
 Forward march!
