 Previously on "Flesh and Bone"... 
 Paul : Says here you were apprenticed at the Pittsburgh ballet at age 18... [Thud] ...then took a leave of absence in that first year, and nothing since. 
 Who's that wide-eyed litt thing? 
 My new roommate. 
 Patrice : Paul signed her on the spot. 
 You a ballerina? 
 Paul : We have a star who is ready to ascend. 
 Jessica : You cannot change the season. 
 I want to launch her in a new ballet. 
 [Sniffs] 
 You're not special. You know that, right? 
 You need to understand your power. 
 Our new Chairman, monsieur Laurent Brousseau! 
 Harness it. Use it. 
 Laurent : And just who is this incandescent for whom you will jeopardize the entire season? 
 Whoa! 
 Oh! 
 I'm so sorry. I tripped. 
 I'll let you work your magic trick on this. 
 I'd be happy to. 
 I miss you. 
 Claire, tell me where you are.

 [ Beeping ] 
 Woman :  We're sorry. 
 You have reached a number that is no longer in service. 
 If you feel that you have reached this recording in error, please check the number and dial... [dog barking in distance] We're sorry. [Bell tolling in distance] We're sorry. [Brakes hiss] [Vehicle departs in distance] [Groans softly] [Car alarm blaring in distance] [Mouse squeaking] "No" means "no." You crossed the line. I told you not to cross the line. "No" means "no." [Water running] [Tie thuds] Are you f*cking kidding me? Morning, Romeo. Good morning. Yes, Clementine, good morning. Did you just call me "Clementine"? I-I took the Liberty of collecting your property for you. I wanted to be sure of your intention, that you have no further need of this. How do you know this is mine? As the steward of this domicile, it's my job to know. It's my job. I see. Well, no further need. Very good. I'll take care of it. You weren't listening to my conversation last night, were you? That would be creepy. Yeah, it would. And... Inappropriate. That would... Be the wrong thing to do. [Car alarm blaring in distance] Sorry. I-I'm... Sorry. Hey, Canal Street's the best place for cheap stuff, right? That's definitely the case. Most definitely, yes. How do I get there? From here? From here. Now? Yeah. Uh, walking above ground will take approximately 25 minutes. Below ground will be much faster, of course, but is, of course, much less safe. Would you like me to escort you? I'll be okay. The subway sounds good. I got to get to work. Well, take the "J" at the essex street station, go down to the basement, and then take the train to Canal Street. Got it. Thanks. Do you need any further assistance? I'm good. Well, if you need any assistance of any kind, I'm always here to help. Okay. Thanks. It's "Claire," by the way. My name's Claire. See you. I'll let the good folks know you're coming. Have a good day! [Sniffs] Clementine. [Siren wailing] [Indistinct conversations] Man :  Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you for choosing Rapidline. We'll be making limited stops on our way to our final destination, New York City. E.T.A.... 9:15. Please sit back and enjoy the ride. [Indistinct conversations] [Click] [Sighs] Ah, thank you. [Groans] Aw, Jesus H. [Groans] You in the service? Me too. 3rd of the 9th. [Chuckles] Back in the day. Ah, they wouldn't want me now, even though I'd go back if I could. [Chuckles] Yep. I sure would. [Jackhammering] [Siren wails in distance] [Piano music plays] Bonjour! Bonjour! Bonjour! Je pourrais baiser avec tout le monde aujourd'hui! My God. You're expecting. You see, we are a conduit to creation. [Telephone ringing] Good morning. My partner in crime.  Bonjour. Hey, can you step in for a minute so we can talk? About...? About the choreographer you want to hire for the new piece for Claire. Xavier's "Romeo and Juliet" was an utter delight. Bomber jackets and poodle skirts. [Chuckles] Clever as hell. Yeah. When was that again? Really? How is it you don't recall? The whole city was buzzing. It was...'99, I believe. Yes. So almost 15 years ago? He's a dream to work with. I never once wanted to bludgeon him. That's... Certainly saying something. I'm just a little concerned, Paul. I know I don't need to remind you that generating box-office excitement is particularly critical this season. And yet you just did... Remind me. Xavier hasn't been on the forefront in quite some time, so I would... Xavier is innovative and, most importantly, collaborative. The last thing I need is a usurper. What we need is a draw... A-a-a hot [Snaps fingers] of-the-moment choreographer. Wajt, wait! Just hear me out! I spoke to Toni cannava, and she's interested. What, the torn-fishnet-wearing, nose-pierced, nouveau vampire? Puh-lease. She could rejuvenate the public's perception of ABC. And what... Pray tell... Is the public's perception? You know perfectly well. It's why you're so excited about Claire. You want us to garner some attention, and I agree. We need to. We're a ballet company, not a museum, right? That was your point with Laurent, wasn't it? Oh, look. We haven't done a new work in quite some time. It's very exciting. No offense to Jeffrey, he believed in the classics. But I believe you're more of a risk-taker than you might have had the opportunity to be in the past, and I support that. Jeffrey and I ran this company in complete and utter harmony. And he... he is missed. More and more with each passing moment. [Sighs] Look, everyone was so... Inspired when you said we are stepping into the now. And in my humble opinion, Toni is the way to do it. By the way,  Pointe  Magazine just did a feature on her. I marked it on the off chance you'd be curious to see what she says about you. [Clears throat] "Part of my fascination with Grayson's choreography is how far he stretches the classical style to make it expressive and engaging." She gets points for paying attention. She cites you as one of her greatest influences. [Sighs] Well, I have to admit I always thought she had a certain... Je ne sais quoi. Can we afford her? I'll make it work. Oh, God. Look at her hair. [Indistinct conversations] Which on of you is Claire? The new girl. You all look the same to me, and you can all use a ham sandwich. Now, which one is Claire? Me. [Indistinct whispering] Have a nice time tonight, dear. [Door opens] Quite the "f*ck me" shoe. Look who's got a new Chairman of her board. [Chuckles] Like they wouldn't kill for those. Take them. You should have them. Mr. Brousseau doesn't know I was wearing your shoes. [Chuckling] Those are all yours, sister. "Looking forward to seeing you tonight... Laurent." What does that mean? What am I supposed to do? Wear them. [Piano playing scales] [Birds chirping] Patrice : So cute! Aww, they're hungry. Where's mommy? Should we feed them? Not unless you want to vomit in their mouths. Ew! Shut up! You shut up! Puking is passé. Those sweet, little things, they do seem hungry. Maybe a rich frenchman will buy them dinner. Ooh. "Frenchman"? What now? [Hands clap] Let's begin. And, facing the barre, warm-up combo, yes? Yes. [Mid-tempo piano music plays] Point. Flex. Point. Brush. Flex. Point, front, and first. Side. Lower. Plié  and stretch. Six. Other side. Flex. Point. [Music ends] Uh... Kiira. [Sighs] Bonjour,  buttercup. [Speaks Ukrainian] [Sniffs] You smell divine. That's your fault. I accept the blame. All right. Don't keep me in suspense. So, no "Giselle." I assume you have new plan for me. [Sighs] We're going to open the evening with "Rubies." Balanchine... you'll amaze. I can't wait. And also the new ballet, yes? It's going to be edgy-modern. I'm not sure you'd be comfortable. We always want to show you at your best, yes? Especially now. "Especially now." How you mean, "especially now"? [Chuckling] Don't take it the wrong way. I want to protect you. I want to ensure you go out the way you should go out... splendor, accolades, flowers at your feet. I'm not going anywhere. It's purely hypothetical. Just thinking ahead... far, far ahead. I don't have to tell you that best strategy is to launch it with me. Ah, everybody's busy telling me what they don't need to tell me today. This Claire... is that her name, "Claire"? She should absolutely do the part, of course. She's delightful. I'm glad you think so. But here's your best box office. Darling, let me stop you right there. I will perform the new ballet in the "A" cast... Somehow, I have managed to produce season after stellar... ...And Claire performs in "B." Yet you're gonna tell me what to do anyway. Yes, of course. I'm big draw and darling of subscriber. This is no-brainer. Just fact. If Claire should perform second night, she can become critics' new discovery. [Sighs] And we have sell-out run. Everybody win. Tell me about your injury. Has it healed? Are you up to the workload? Two ballets. "Rubies" is taxing in and of itself. I'm fine. I'm perfect. Yes, you are. More soon. [Footsteps depart] [Mid-tempo piano music playing] Why you look at floor? Up, up. Oh. Balance. You are too slow. Mia. What are you... man? Lighter, light, light. "Am I a man?" Suck my dick. Don't let her get under your skin. [Sighs] Has anyone ever died from menopause? A girl can dream. Bitch. Her tits are two counts behind. [Sweetly] Nice job. Thanks. You look great out there. Gee whiz. Thanks, Bambi. What's your problem? It's a term of endearment. Gee whiz. Thanks. Touchy, touchy. Play nice, kitty cats. No, Daphne,  nyet.  Not good enough. Hang on. Do over. Love ya. [Clicks tongue] I'll get it next time. I don't hold breath. [Man snoring] [Snorts] Oh, pretty little bit, huh? That your girl? Yeah. On your way to see her? Yeah. It's been a long time. Oh, you got doubts. It's been a long time. Eh, look, I've been through the same thing myself. Your brain plays all kinds of tricks on you when you're overseas... tells you all kinds of fucked-up sh1t. [Chuckles] I was su that my gal was banging the doctor, the lawyer, the Indian chief. But I was wrong... dead wrong. She was waiting for me, right as rain. Yeah, some things never change, though. Gonna be the same for you, marine. Look, you two kids have a history together, huh? That counts for something. You hang onto that, all right? I got to get some shut-eye. You mark my words... she's gonna say yes, so you marry that gal the first chance you get. That's your new assignment. [Laughs] [Sighs] Sure, sure, sure. All right. Get your beauty rest. [Sighs] Wait here. [Ringing] Come on. [Buzzer] [Thudding in distance] [Knocks "Shave and a Haircut"] [Lock disengages] [Sighs] Prima. I hate it when you call me that. I'm wearing pants. 
 
 [Indian-style music plays] What ho, milady? What news of the world? I don't have time. You're hurting my feelings. [Exhales deeply] But she understands. She's beautiful, isn't she? Jaer, I'm not gonna be late for rehearsal first day back. All right, all right. Jesus. It's too early for all this edginess. Do not make me freak out more than I already am! How could I possibly do that? Go smooth those feathers. [Scoffs] f*cking Paul. You should see how he looks at his new little muse. If he thinks he can push me aside, he has another thought coming. "Thing"... another "thing" comi... never mind. I had to go to him to beg for the part... beg! Did he come to me? No. It was humiliating. I'm sure he was putty in your persuasive, pretty hand. You know what I hear after? We get some crazy choreographer to do "modern" ballet. How will this look good on me? [Voice breaking] Everything is against me. Everything is totally f*cked. [Sighs] I need to put my sh1t together. But how I put my sh1t together when I can't even walk... Let alone do 32  fouettés  8 million times and do them better than all those bloodthirsty bitches half my age who just grinding their teeth waiting for their chance. [Sniffs] Ah, the sound of pending sanity. Can I get an extra gram? Just need to make it through this week. Listen to me. [Safe closes] You're going to be brilliant, and you are going to kill it. You are an assassin. I'm not just some vending machine. I'll hang next time. Promise. Right now, I got to go piss on my territory. c**t. Super c**t. I can't f*cking stand her. Blows into town, blows Paul, and gets the lead in a new ballet. It's completely f*cked. Don't give me that look. I have a right to be aggravated. Rub my shoulders. I pinched a nerve in my neck or something. It's driving me crazy. You were crazy long before pinched nerve. [Sighs] I'd tell you to f*ck off but that feels really good. You need focus on bigger picture. This is my picture, Pasha. It's the only picture I've got. You must accepting reality, otherwise you go more crazy. Bite me. [Sirens wailing in distance] What am I doing wrong? I'm saying it is what is. Not everyone wins lottery. Take me. I want to be Beethoven. Am I Beethoven? No. Not gonna happen. Don't be telling me I can't be the ballet Beethoven, 'cause I damn well can. Now my sight, it goes. In three years, when my eyes give up ghost, I'm go playing for tips in hotel lobby. So. Don't be trying to make me be all sensible and sh1t. Want to know what the reality is? Reality is... I got to step up my game. You'll see. I am ready. [Pointe shoes thudding] [Telephone ringing, indistinct conversations] I never should have let the fiancé get in my pants. Or anywhere even close to my pants. Dear God. What's wrong? Oh, preschool tuition. I feel your pain. I should have started saving before we pulled the damn goalie. [Chuckles] [Sighs] Claire! I texted you twice this morning. I need your direct-deposit info. Sorry. I disconnected my number. I have a new one now. How much is the principal-dancer salary? A lot more than you're making. But I'm gonna be dancing a principal role. [Sighs] Well, you've got a corps contract. That happens. Sorry, sweetie. I don't know what else to tell you. [Munching] Well, you assumed wrong. It's not a promotion. It's an opportunity. All in good time, lovely girl. All in good time. You're still untested, regardless of what triumphs await you. Thank you. I also wanted to ask you about Mr. Brousseau. Dinner tonight, yes. Dinner and... Shoes. Such a thoughtful man. You made quite an impression on him. You know how to get to where you're going? Uh, not yet, but I just wanted to ask... Reggie! Mm. The restaurant at the hotel is absolute heaven, by the way. You'll adore it. Reggie! Oh, never mind. I bet they don't have anything like it in... Hmm. How funny. Where is it you're from, again? I think I blocked it out. Starts with a "P." Puh-puh. Puh-puh-puh-puh-puh... Pittsburgh. Oh. Pittsburgh. Onomatopoeia, isn't it? [Chuckles] Come! Come, come, come! This is a business dinner, right? What else would it be? I guess I'm just worried about the, um, impression, is all. Monsieur Brousseau is investing in you... In us. He wants to get to know you better. It's a perfectly reasonable request. Okay. Good. Okay. So it's just business, nothing more. Everything in regards to ballet is such a delicate balance, isn't it? Nothing has been explicitly stated. They call them "f*ck me" shoes. Beg your pardon? Who does? Everyone. It's a figure of speech. What do you care what the green-eyed monsters think? Sounds pretty explicit to me. Primas don't travel in a pack! You got to start thinking for yourself, so think! [Sighs] You're about to star in a ballet created specifically for you. Do you want this opportunity? I'm going to need you to answer me. Yes. I couldn't hear you. What? Yes, I want it. It's very simple, Claire. You're an exceptional ballerina who's going to have an exquisite meal with a rich, charming man who just changed your life. We're a very lucky company to have monsieur Brousseau. I want everything to work out for the best. I know you do, too. You've traveled so far so fast. It is just business, Claire. Good business. Understand? Yes? Live a little. Have an adventure. It's what being young and beautiful is all about. [Clicks tongue] Merde. Claire. Order the duck. It's to die for. Man : And there were these guys down there with diamonds in their pockets. [Chuckling] I sh1t you not, they just walk around with them. That's where you got to go. That's where you'll get the most bang for your buck. So when you pop the question, she can't say no, 'cause her eyes will be all dazzled and all. [Chuckles] That's where I picked mine up way back when. Them jews got the best rocks and the best prices, hands down. See, negotiating is the key. I got myself a very sweet deal if I do say so myself. I'll even go down there with you if you want. Say, we can make a day of it, huh? How about it? Sound good? [Chuckles] We'll get a beer and a slice and some sparkle for your girl. [Grunts] [Groans] [Groans softly] [Door closes] [Piano playing in distance] Claire. Can you do me a favor? This is really helpful. Can we try it again? Great. And... That's it, right? I don't know. Is that it? Don't. [Chuckling] All right. All right. I won't push my luck. Can we just try it again? [Horns honking, indistinct conversations] Man : Damn. Woman : See you later. You signed for it? Aw, thanks, Romeo. It's the only good thing that's happened today. "The only good thing"? That sounds like the chapter of a book. Did I tell you I'm writing a book? If I give you some cash, will you help me carry it up the stairs? [Grunts] I was working on it when I was in college, this book, and it got away from me. And now I've gotten back into it, and now it won't stop. What's it about? [Grunts] Events. Okay. So is it fiction or...? You know how they say "a storm is brewing"? Did you know that a storm can be a blizzard or a blitzkrieg, an assault or anger? A storm even has eyes. A storm is... well, I'll start at the beginning. You want to hear the first paragraph? I have it all in my head. I mean, it's all written down, all of it so far, but I know it by heart. Sure. I never told it to anyone before. Never said it out loud, except to myself. I say it to myself frequently... quite frequently. I'm flattered. But now is exactly the time. It's exactly the time to tell you. "It was a dark and stormy night." Aha! Gotcha! [Chuckles] I'm just kidding. There's nothing wrong with you. "The folk huddled together and wondered when the world would turn gray. There was a notion among them, rippling through their collective imaginations like a pebble tossed into still water, a notion that made them feel uncertain about some things, undetermined about others. Some folks say they can smell the weather. Some say they feel it in their bones. Regardless, no one felt safe, and measures were taken, because this time, if the storm came again, well... This time they would be ready." Wow. That's really good, Romeo. Thank you very much. I got chills. I'd love to read it when you're finished. I love to read. [Chuckles] Clementine and her suitcase library. [Breathing heavily] You sure I can't give you anything for your trouble? These are yours? Can I... May I borrow one? It's just... I miss them. I-I know the one I want. That one. Take good care of it. It means a lot to me. Don't know why you bothered. [Horns honking in distance] [Door closes] [Water running] [Water shuts off] You look like a new toy. Sorry. It's okay. You're right. Why don't you want to go? It doesn't matter what I want. It always matters. No... yes, it matters. For anyone else, this would be an adventure. Here's my question to you... and this is always  the  question. This is the question that must be asked... is it the right thing to do? 'Cause you don't have to go if it's not the right thing to do. The right thing is paramount. The right thing is everything. That's how you know. That is the way to know. I'm gonna go. I'll be fine. There's nothing wrong with you. Wait! I have a gift. For pain. There are all kinds of pain. You got to do what you got to do, go where you got to go. The thing is, you can be there, but you don't have to  be  there. [Soft piano music playing] Such a little bird. I can feel the beat of your heart even here. [Indistinct conversations] You look very beautiful. I hope you enjoy the shoes? Yes. Thank you. Oh. Thanks. Thank you. Lovely here, no? Waiter : Good evening, monsieur. Ah, here we are. Very good. I took the liberty. Mmm. One of my favorites. I hope it will also become yours. Thank you, Mr. Brousseau. No need to be so formal. We are no longer strangers. I am Laurent. Laurent. [Chuckles nervously] I brought you something. Turns out I'm not much of a magician. I'm sorry I couldn't save yours. I had to put it out of its misery. Merci. You shouldn't have. It was the least I could do. Yes. But it's charming... As are you. Merci. [Flatly] Well... À la votre. [Glasses clink] [Slurred] My dad's never missed a steelers game since like 1975 till he took a heart attack a couple years back. I'm very sorry to hear that. They kind of suck ass right now, but we loves them anyway. You know how it goes. You got a favorite team? I do not. Geez. Really? [Chuckles] Since I was little, we went every game. Pop always gave me the beer money to pay the vendor so he didn't have to stop waving his terrible towel. [Chuckles] He waved that damn thing through the whole damn game. "Terrible towel"? You got to be kidding me. It's famous! The famous yellow towel? The terrible towel? The towel? [Chuckles] Us fans, we're super superstitious about that thing. It's got, like, mystical powers. Want me to half in twos for yinz? The duck... it died. So good. Youse guys knocked it out of the park. [Chuckles] Please arrive in five minutes. Room 1132. [Somber music playing] [Beep] [Clatter] Come here. You're going to undress? You spend your days next-to-naked. Surely this cannot be of concern? Are you really such a little bird? Arms. Up, up. All right. Step. Very nice. Step again. Step! Step! Mm. Yes. Very nice. Let me see you. Turn around for me. Turn around! Bien. Fermé la bouche,  ballerina. We have had quite enough conversation. [Belt clinking] [Plastic rips] [Gagging] Ugh. [Sighs] [Coughs] [Telephone receiver clicks, dials] Please bring my car. [Horns honking, indistinct conversations] [Water running] [Somber music plays]
