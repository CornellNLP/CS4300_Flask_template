 Previously on "Flesh and Bone"...  
 I want you gone. 
 Mia :  I've seen how she treats you, Bryan... 
 Like you're some disease she's got to hide. [Screams] 
 Mia :  Rub my shoulders. 
 I pinched a nerve in my neck. It's driving me crazy. 
 There. Shall we try another? 
 Trey [Fingers snap] please step in. 
 What? 
 They told me to give you this. 
 They are days away from kicking her out. 
 This is a one-time, anonymous gift. 
 We need to talk about your new girl. 
 Toni says you're not cutting it. 
 What's your problem, sweetie? Your defect? 
 Do not  ever  tell these men your real name. 
 Cam :  Who are you? 
 I'm supposed to dance for you. 
 Strip clubs aren't really my thing. 
 So you're just gonna send me away? 
 I have a boyfriend! 
 Bryan :  Claire!! Did he touch you?!

 Sergei :  It is almost a shame to see them imprisoned like this... 
 Beautiful birds in a cage. 
 They belonged to Pierina Legnani, destroyed during single performance of "Swan Lake." 
 Do you know Pierina Legnani? 
 Of course. 
 The bitch introduced Black Swan's 32  fouettés en tournant. 
 One of my favorite ballets. 
 One of the hardest to dance. 
 I should head down. 
 You just arrived. Plenty of time. 
 Sit, please. 
 The funds I transferred to American Ballet Company... 
 The funds you asked for... 
 Left my account two weeks ago. 
 $250,000. 
 Yes. 
 Thank you. 
 I really wanted you to have this opportunity. 
 And yet I have received no "thank you" card, no tickets to ballet, no invitation to any gala. 
 I know it's not ideal, but your donation has to remain anonymous. 
 I'm left out in cold, like shabby child with nose pressed up against glass of bakery, longing for single bite. 
 I'm sorry, Sergei. 
 It's just for now. 
 I know you understand that. 
 I do, but... once ABC has spent Sergei's money, I will get my bite. 
 For now, since you will not bring Sergei to ballet, you must bring ballet to Sergei. 
 I throw big party on yacht... many important people. 
 Champagne, caviar, moonlight, music... ballet. 
 It will be beautiful evening. 
 You will dance "Swan Lake" on yacht. 
 I promise to give Pierina a run for her money. 
 And Claire. 
 She will dance, too. 
 We wouldn't miss it. 
 Claire is at Anastasia a lot lately. 
 Always with same man. You know him? 
 Cameron Miller... man who knows what he likes. 
 Good for business. 
 Make sure she keeps it inside club.

 ... awesome. 
 You have to let me take you out of here now. 
 W... we... we can start small, something easy. 
 Please, please, please come with me to my boss's party Friday night. 
 Friday night? 
 It'll be obnoxious and boring. You are a thousand times more real... 
 ... than any of my hedge-fund friends or their vapid wives. 
 Thanks. [Laughs] 
 We... we can make fun of them together. 
 Hell... 
 Your company will make the whole thing bearable. 
 What do you say? 
 [Indistinct conversations] 
 [Horn honks] 
 Romeo :  Clementine! 
 I don't like it! 
 What are you doing? 
 It makes me nervous, you always walking alone so late. 
 Gets later and later. 
 I guess I lost track of the time. 
 Any one of them grey M*therf*ckers come near you?! 
 I'm fine... 
 Great, actually. 
 I apologize for the crass language, but you got to be more careful. 
 Yeah. 
 But it's a fine line between careful and boring, Romeo. 
 You don't have to worry about me. 
 But dangerous times are upon us. 
 Everything's moving faster since you got here. 
 Oh. 
 The only thing that keeps away the grey is the dead of their own. 
 I have a huge day. 
 I vow to keep my post until Jimjo returns. 
 Who's Jimjo? 
 Soldier of white light and glass, held you tight against the grey nightmare. 
 I knew him from his gear. 
 And the way he held you, Clementine... 
 Held you safe. 
 I'm Claire, Romeo. 
 I keep myself safe. 
 Sure thing. Sure you do. 
 But Jimjo knows his part. 
 He'll be back. He'll protect her. 
 The plagues will end. 
 [Footsteps approaching] 
 [Door opens] 
 Almost didn't recognize you with food in your mouth. 
 The f*ck's with you, cunty Malone? 
 Those are my eggs. 
 Well, I'm stuck with you living in my apartment, so I'm gonna call it even. 
 Make sure you replace them. 
 I'll get right on it. 
 My mother's coming tomorrow. 
 This is me being a considerate roommate, letting you know I'm gonna have a guest. 
 She's staying here? 
 Yeah. 
 Like that freak brother you never mentioned was coming. 
 That's funny. 
 You seemed to enjoy him when he was here. 
 Hey. 
 I don't want him back here. 
 [Children talking] 
 Okay, I love you. 
 I love you, too. 
 Pick you up after school. 
 Okay. 
 Thank you. 
 Excuse me, Mrs. Hughes. 
 It's  Ms.  Jordan. 
 Pardon me? 
 I'm divorced, Diane. My name is Jordan. 
 Uh, yeah, of course. 
 Well, this is awkward. 
 I'd hoped the note we sent home was clear. 
 Oh, it was as a bell. 
 I'm afraid Molly may not return to class until her tuition bill is paid in full. 
 $35,000, correct? 
 Yes. 
 Thank you. 
 I'm sorry for all this tuition unpleasantness, Jessica. 
 I realize you've been going through a difficult... 
 f*ck you, Diane. 
 f*ck you. 
 f*ck your twinset. 
 You like colonics? 
 Because if you ever send a ransom note home with my daughter again, I will take that twinset and I will give you a world-class enema. 
 [Classical music plays] 
 And up. Crisp. 
 [Claps hands] Fast. With the music. 
 Strengthen through the core. 
 Precision! 
 Nyet.  Mia, Mia, what are you doing? Pay attention. 
 What the f*ck? 
 Sorry. 
 Sorry, Ivana. I... I think I have food poisoning or something. 
 "Or something," yes. 
 You dance like a circus ape. 
 I ate an egg. I never eat eggs. 
 You are a pathetic weakling. 
 It must be salmonella. 
 Weak constitution. 
 Weak ankles. Weak will. 
 Go. 
 Go home with your salmonella, your egg. 
 The rest of you, once more before break. 
 You, come. 
 Patarapis'! 
 Pasha. 
 Pasha! 
 [Classical music plays] 
 [Dance music plays] 
 Oh, Colin. 
 This lighting would put jowls on a greyhound. 
 Another soft box, please. 
 [Gasps] 
 Vous êtes une vision de la perfection. 
 C'est tout pour vous, mon chéri. [Camera shutters clicking] Good morning. Ready to be venerated, worshiped, adored? [Gasps] God, you are like some kind of civet. I love it. I love this. Love. Show the camera your marrow. Strip yourself bare. Let it devour you. People, we need a publicity shot that will give every bread-belt, beer-guzzling tourist who visits Times Square or takes a cab in this city a wrathful hard-on. Luckily, we are graced by the two most ravishing artists to ever  jeté across these hallowed halls... Viagra on pointe shoes. Angels, we're relying on you. I'm  relying on you. Please, engorge me. Woman :  That's Toni! Man :  That's Toni Cannava. That's Toni Cannava. Love the eyes. I don't know. Something isn't working yet. [Gasps] No, uh... There. Don't you think it obscures the line? She is the primordial woman-child. f*ck the line. [Camera shutter clicking] Please, please, please, please, please. Good. Let's take it from the turn, yeah? So, turn, and da-da-da-da-da, into the  développé. Foom,  into the step-step sissonne. Just to there, yeah? Ignore the camera. All you have to do is go inside. Be it. Live it. It is in you. Yes? Yes. Let's do this thing. Let's have wind and music! [Classical music plays] [Camera shutter clicking] Thought the clumsy cow had food poisoning. Everyone knows she doesn't eat. She doesn't eat in public. f*cking dump truck. Jesus Christ, leave her alone. Easy for you to say. Farmer in the Dell over there didn't plow into you right in front of Ivana. Patrick could have been injured. She still could. Quite a performance this morning. How would you know? You're blind. Going  blind, not deaf. You knocked down a row of girls. One girl... a single wannarexic. I hope those carrots get lodged in her throat next to Suzanne's dental dam. It's probably just a nutrition thing. I had a powerbar. It's my eye. One's not working right. No big deal. No big deal? You know this how? You're a doctor? You have medical degree? No. You're enemy of yourself. My ophthalmologist. He's Chinaman, but still, not bad. You go. You get tests. Great. What did I tell you? Divine. Holy crap, girlfriend. You killed  it. That was some goddamn goddess sh1t right there. I guess I was just feeling... I don't know... good. I used to just do vegan protein in my green smoothie, but I've started raw eggs. Gross, right? I need the extra protein now that I have to lift miss thing over my head all day. Lord, she's working my last good nerve. I don't know how you did it for so long. Ross? Ross :  Yeah? What's going on with you? Sorry. It's been a long day. Think you mean a long couple of weeks, because that's how long you've been ignoring me. I hope this isn't about "Rubies," because I've spent years as your understudy with a smile on my face because I'm your friend and I was happy for you. Can't you just try to be happy for me? It's not like I had anything to do with it. Can't blame me. Are you blaming me? [Scoffs] Paul wanted me, okay? Not you. That's just the way it goes. You want to know why you got the part? Because I don't suck cock, all right? That  why you got it. f*ck you. I got to go. Can you please get out of my way? Wait a second. Did something happen with Paul? Yo, Angel. Not bad work for a stripper skank. Thanks. Hope Kiira doesn't throw acid in my face. Acid's a Moscow thing. That bitch is Ukrainian. Speaking of former Soviets, your biggest fan invited us to a party. We're the entertainment. What are we supposed to do? Relax. You don't have to get naked. We just have to dance "Swan Lake." For who, Russian mobsters? Sounds dangerous. [Laughing] It sounds dope. Come on. Sergei said it's champagne, caviar... Star treatment all the way, on a big-ass yacht. It'll be a blast. I've never been on a yacht. Carpe diem. Town car will pick us up tomorrow night at 8:00. Oh, I have plans tomorrow night. I promised this guy. Wait. A  guy  guy? His name's Cam. You've seen him. He invited me to an event, and I want to go. Bad idea. I told you, management frowns on business outside the club. I won't tell management. It's none of his business who I date. Oh, honey. It's not a date. You're his escort. That's not true. He met you in a strip club. I know him. We... He's not a strip-club kind of guy. I got to go. [Zipper unzips] [Dialing] [Ringing] Bryan :  This is Bryan. Leave a message. [Beep] Hey. It's me. I know... I know we haven't spoken since you were here. But I just want you to know... I hope you're okay. [Sitar music playing] Jasper :  Nature, in her multi-splendored glory. Her magical myriad of eternal variation made most of us, her children, to many purposes. Within the infant rind of this weak flower, poison hath residence and medicine power. But there are those she made more special, more distinct... Made for one purpose and one purpose only. A predatory cat is one such distinction... Line, muscle, fang, claw, a fierce and brutal beauty. A tiny leopard. Serval. She's a little sellout. Look at her. [Serval purring] A perfect predator, but for the want of a full belly, she's... given up her poetry. She still has her poetry. [Both laugh] Your laughter has poetry. I love you. I love you more. You're my fav... You're my favorite. [Both laugh] [Cellphone rings] Oh, Prescott. [Snores] [Snorts] Oops. Sorry. You just say his name, and I nod off. That is my husband. He's a kind man, a good man. He takes care of me. A serval in an emerald collar. I'm not an animal. But, darling, Prescott is just waiting for you to retire so he can breed you like one. I'm sorry. Prescott is none of my business. Please, accept my apology. I beg of you. Prima. Bad boy. Don't call me that. When I'm here, I'm only Kiira. Kiira Koval. Laugh for me. Make me. [Both laugh] [Growling] 
 
 [Dance music plays] Paul :  And Claire was positively sensual, thanks to me... my guidance, my counsel. What? I opened that seized-up little clam while Toni was winging her way home, singing "Kumbaya" on the f*cking "L" train! We took the 7. Where the f*ck are we? Jackson Heights! Aah! [Laughs] Now, you listen to me, chica. No more work, work, work, blah, blah, blah. You're gonna drink. You're gonna dance. No more poopy face tonight. ♪  Besito pa tí  ♪ 
♪  Besito pa tí  ♪ 
♪  besito de azúcar, canela y anis  ♪ 
♪ kiss me once more plus once again ♪ [Laughs] Yay! ♪ One kiss for you, one kiss for me ♪ [Singing in Spanish] ♪ One kiss for you, one kiss for me ♪ [Singing in Spanish] Woman :  Ah, you got me all excited. Oh! Wah! [Music continues] [Speaking Spanish] Aah! It's a big club,  viejo. Find your own man. Step aside,  muchacho. Let the grown-ups dance. That tired old rumba you learned in Havana before the revolution is not dancing. Now, get the f*ck out of my face before I knock out those cheap veneers, okay? Vete a tu pigna, chocha. [Car door opens] Prescott :  Did you get my calls? I was picking up some hot chocolates from confiserie. I didn't know whether you wanted hazelnut or dark. I went with dark. Thank you, sweetheart. I'm sorry. I'm exhausted. When are you gonna stop working so hard? I wish you'd take better care of yourself. Warm up the chocolate. [Water running] [Moaning softly] [Moaning, grunting] You're beautiful, papi. I've seen your pain. I've seen your heart. I know who you are inside. [Claire sniffles] Dr. Lee :  Okay, and blink for me. Very good. Look up. Good. And down. Do you have any history of substance abuse? Diet pills, laxatives those count? Yes. What about stress? Any undue pressures from work or at home? Are you sh1tting me? Okay. Look at my left ear. So, I just need to eat more, right? And blink. This happened to a girl last season. She went blind right before she got a serious case of the runs. Her colon was perforated. She had to go to the hospital, and she lost her place in the corps. Right ear. Blink. She auditioned again this year, but the hospital food porked her up, so... Blink again. She's a waitress at Hooters now. They make good money, but I don't think they're that pretty. Sit back. I want you to see a neurologist... I'll lay off the diet pills. ... Just to run a few more tests. Now, it might be a nutrient issue, as you say, but it's important that we rule things out. What kind of things? That's for a neurologist to decide. In the meantime, I recommend a multivitam. And lay off the diet pills. [Intercom buzzes] [Buzzing continues] Hello? Lainie :  It's Lainie! [Door buzzes] Lainie :  Christ in a cradle. There enough stairs in this place? What am I, a workhorse? Jesus. You must be Mia's mom. And you must be the competish. Robbins, right? What is that, French? Nice tits. They real? Mia's not home, Mrs. Bialy. [Door closes] It's Lainie. Mrs. Bialy's my mother. Lainie. Uh, I heard her leave about an hour ago. Good. Early bird gets the worm. God knows that kid could use all the help she can get. What's your father do? Uh, he's on disability. He's collecting? Great. Guess that means you're on the market, too. [Sighs] You gonna give me a hand here or what? [Grunts] Ooh. Oh, careful. My Zales is in there. [Grunts] [Sighs] [Sighs] Jesus Christ. [Knock on door] [Door opens] Everybody wants something. Trey :  I'm so sorry to have to bother you, Paul, but I knew if I went to Jessica with this, she'd get her panties in a twist. Arrive at the point. [Door closes] It's just I don't want to involve any lawyers, obviously, so I thought it best to come straight to you. Trey, princess, what the f*ck are you talking about? Well, the thing is, Paul, Ross is very upset. R... Ross is upset? Yes, very. I have a raging hangover, Trey. Ross told me about your private rehearsal you held with him a few weeks ago. I hold private rehearsals with all my soloists. That's what I told him. But you know how straight boys are... Always so touchy about their dance belts. What do you want, Trey? Before you answer that, let me ask you this. You actually believe those lilies will protect your faggoty ass from being fired? No. I think the Whistleblower Protection Act will protect my faggoty ass. Go to class. We'll discuss what will become of your ass later. I could probably smooth things over with Ross as a thank-you for the generous opportunity you've given me to partner with Kiira in "Rubies." [Scoffs] The little fairy has a set of brass balls. Good for you, Trey. I'm sure you'll be dazzling in "Rubies." I look forward to the official announcement that I'll be taking over the lead for good. [Indistinct conversations] Hey. I'll go with you to the yacht. You sure? What about Cam? He's just another bullshit savior trying to get my real name. He wants to see me, I'm in the club twice a week. Damn, Angel. I've corrupted you. [Classical music plays] [Door opens] Oh! [Scoffs] It's... Yeah. [Bells clanging in distance] [Birds cawing] [Indistinct conversations] [Classical music playing] [Speaking Russian] My guests of honor. Welcome. Happy to be here. Ballerina. I'm so very joyful you are here. Come. I will show you where you will perform. She's just a kid. An enchanted forest. I make for you. Musicians all the way from theatre orchestra of St. Petersburg. Sergei helps them obtain passports. Come, meet my colleagues. [Speaks Russian] American Ballet Company New York. [Conversing in Russian] [Speaks Russian] Claire, this is Alex. Pleased to meet you.

I had food poisoning, Ma. Food poisoning. [Scoffs] You think that hot little number you live with ever gets food poisoning? She's got her act together, that girl. And she's gorgeous. No wonder Paul's got her dancing out front while you're still holding up the scenery. You better figure your sh1t out, Mia. No patron is gonna notice you in the back row with the clydesdales. I had food poisoning. I didn't come all the way into the city to watch you mope. It's my birthday. Well, hello. Nick :  Hello. Hey, how are you? Good. How are you doing? Good. Have a seat? Oh, yes, I would love to. Great. What are we drinking? We're drinking scotch. Do you want a scotch? I will drink a scotch. Good choice. Mike, can we get one? There you go. Being a gentleman here, okay? Man :  There you go. All right. Bottoms up. Cheers. She's going straight for it. I'm ready to go. I am ready to go. Good girl. My kind of lady. So, where are you guys from? [Conversation continues indistinctly] Looking good. Beautiful tonight. Oh, thank you. Out and about. [Glasses clink] Cheers. We're off to a good night. Just a little something. Just a little something. We're out on the town. Exactly. Well, you dressed up, too. This is great. Thanks for noticing. I really appreciate it, you know? Oh, of course. Very nice. This is nice. You guys all... Hello, boys. How's the dow? Up, now that you're here. Let me guess... Yoga instructor. I'm a ballet dancer. I f*cking transcend. sh1t. What's your name, handsome? Nick. Nick Coleman. Of the Westchester Colemans? You know my family? I'm f*cking with you. I see you're feeling better. Mia Bialy, of the Jersey Bialys... Exit 15 off the turnpike. That's my kid sister. We're celebrating my birthday. Hey, Happy Birthday. How about you buy me a drink, Nick Coleman? To celebrate. All right. Mike, one more. [Chuckles] [Laughs] Oh, God, I want you bad. Oh, you're so f*cking beautiful. [Fly unzips] I want you right now. Stop. What do you mean, "stop"? Stop! Get off me! [Fly zips] You're crazy.

[Speaks Russian] [Speaks Russian] [Laughter] [Speaks Russian] I hope you will enjoy. [Applause] I'm sorry. The floor is damp. [Shouts in Russian] [Speaks Russian] [Laughter] [Fingers snap] [Speaks Russian] [Classical music plays] [Cheers and applause] Brava! Sublime. [Cheers and applause continue] f*ck me. Following you is like following glasnost. Merde. [Classical music playing] [Moaning] [Door opens] [Speaks Russian] Teddy :  Not the ballerinas. Thank you, Teddy. Don't mention it. I know you can handle yourself. I'll be outside. [Knock on door] Teddy? You dressed? Come in. [Door opens] Thank you. I... I'm sorry. I... My name. I'm from Pavlovo. Tell family where I am. Please. Got everything you need in here? I do now. Spasibo. [Door closes] [Bells clanging in distance] A girl could get used to this prima treatment. Thanks for coming with. I owe you. Ballerinas. I was transported. Tonight, you remind Sergei he has a soul. My humblest thanks. Anything for you, doll. Sergei... There was a girl. What girl? The one that wiped the floor. I didn't see her get in a van. There are many girls, Angel. Who can keep track of them all? [Taps car] [Engine turns over] [Chuckles] I f*ckin' nailed those f*ckin'  fouettés.
