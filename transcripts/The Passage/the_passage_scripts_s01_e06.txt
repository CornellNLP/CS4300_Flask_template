 Previously on  The Passage...   
 Horace Guilder.   
 Department of Defense.   
 - You're a bad guy. 
- Did you just read my mind?   
 Now it's time to induce telepathic connection.   
 Stand up, Winston.   
 - I'm a freaking genius. 
- I was exposed   
 to Carter's blood.   
 - [GROWLS] 
- [YELLS]    
 [ROARING]    
 FANNING: I can't believe you let   
 Elizabeth get that bad.    
 - You could bring her back. 
- By giving her    
 the virus?   
 How do you feel about    
 getting out of this place?   
 You got a plan?    
 I suggest you run.    
 [YELLS]    
 Run!    
 [SCREAMS]    
 - You just did that. 
- I just did that.

 [HIGH-PITCHED ALARM WAILING]    
 [HELICOPTER WHIRRING]    
 [INDISTINCT CHATTER]    
 FEMALE VOICE [OVER P.A.]:...protocols are now in effect.   
 Project Noah is locked down.   
 WOLGAST: Damn it.    
 [WOLGAST GRUNTING]    
 [EXHALES]    
 - Hey. 
- [GROANS]    
 - [GROANS SOFTLY] 
- Hey, hey, take it easy.    
 It's okay.    
 - I'm here. 
- Mm-hmm.    
 That scream.    
 How did you do that?    
 I don't know.    
 - I just did it. 
- Okay.    
 RICHARDS: Wolgast, you in there?    
 Yeah! Yeah, we're in here.    
 The elevator's stuck, and I can't get it moving.    
 RICHARDS: Give me a minute.    
 [GROANING SOFTLY]    
 Hey. Take it easy.    
 All right, listen to me. I have to explain something to you.    
 - My book. 
- I know. Sweetheart...    
 No, no, no, my book. I shouldn't have left it.    
 I don't want to lose it.    
 Okay, this is more important.    
 What you did back there... That was awesome.    
 You saved my life.    
 But you cannot tell anybody what you can do.    
 The mind reading or the crazy scream, none of it. I don't trust these people.    
 Promise me?    
 - I just want my book. 
- [CREAKING]    
 [THUDDING]    
 Get back, back.    
 [HIGH-PITCHED ALARM BLARING]    
 [SIGHS]    
 - She all right? 
- She's fine.    
 Is that thing still out there?    
 Not for long. We're tracking him now.    
 Let's get them to the safe room.    
 [ALARM CONTINUES WAILING]    
 [BOTH SIGH]    
 Jonas.    
 What happened to me?    
 You were sick.    
 I don't think I'm sick anymore.    
 No.    
 No, I don't think you are, either.    
 I missed you.    
 I missed you, too.    
 - [HIGH-PITCHED ALARM WAILING] 
- [INDISTINCT RADIO CHATTER]    
 Dr. Pet.    
 I'm so sorry.    
 What a mess.    
 Is that all you can say? This is all your fault.    
 Really? I just authorized the funding for this project.    
 You made these monsters.    
 I warned you that the virals were dangerous.    
 I told you that we don't understand them.    
 Now can we agree that we should shut down?    
 No. We can't.    
 Major Sykes, you sat in my office and practically wept when we offered you the job.    
 Now, for the first time in three years, I'm finally seeing something of value come off this island of Dr. Moreau, so we're gonna see where this goes.    
 The body count doesn't bother you?    
 This hypocritical line in the sand you've suddenly drawn?    
 Please. You've been experimenting on human beings for three years.    
 And if Winston eats half of Colorado, the tab for that meal will be picked up by you and Dr. Lear.    
 Ah. Everything looks great, Shauna.    
 I'm happy with all your stats.     
 Do you have any questions for me?     
 Not a question so much as an observation.     
 This place is boring.     
 Death row was more exciting.     
 Well, we have a sudoku book and jigsaw puzzle.     
 That sounds great.     
 If you could also bring me a gun so I could shoot myself in the head.     
 [SCOFFS]     
 What can we do for you, Shauna?     
 How about a horror movie?     
 Please?     
 Literally, this is my best friend.     
 Which horror movie?     
 Surprise me.     
 Well, the only horror movie I've ever seen is  I Still Know What You Did Last Summer.   
 Okay, I'm gonna pretend I didn't hear that.     
 I don't understand this weird, sheltered life you've led where you've literally never seen or heard of anything.     
 - You don't know me. 
- And why is that,     
 Dr. Everything in My Life Is a Secret?     
 - You want a horror movie? 
- Mm-hmm.     
 Okay. I'll see what I can do.     
 - Pizza would be nice, too. 
- Don't push it.     
 - [DOOR CLOSES] 
- SOLDIER:  Ma'am?   
 Ma'am?     
 They need you upstairs.     
 [INDISTINCT CHATTER]     
 That's affirmative, sir, that's correct...     
 - I want my book. 
- I...     
 I know, sweetie, but we don't have time to look for it right now.     
 RICHARDS: Winston's off the perimeter.     
 Tore the locator chip from his neck.     
 They found it near the fence.     
 Could be anywhere.     
 Richards, we need to contain this.     
 If Winston gets to a densely populated area, that's the end.     
 RICHARDS: I'm aware. The drones can't penetrate the canopies...     
 See if you can pick him up on satellite.     
 I think I'm seeing what Winston's seeing.     
 Amy, no. Quiet.     
 Amy, do you know Winston's location?     
 She's not getting involved in this.     
 Amy, are you saying you can read his mind?     
 Unbelievable.     
 What exactly can you see?     
 Lights. Headlights going by.     
 [SNAPS FINGERS] I knew it! She can do it!     
 Maybe Winston's near a highway.     
 - Could be the    . 
- All right.     
 Well, then, we should go there, and we should bring Amy with us.     
 No, you're not taking a little girl to chase after a nightmare     
 - that you created. 
- I can help.     
 - You saw what I did before. 
- No.     
 I can find him.     
 Think about all the people he might hurt.     
 If she goes, I go.     
 What do you think, Amy? Is it all right if he comes?     
 - Yeah. 
- All right, then.     
 He can come, but you're riding with me.     
 Let's go. [CLAPS]     
 Let's go!     
 Clark?     
 Take care of Amy.     
 And be careful.     
 I will.     
 I mean it.     
 Don't die while we're in the middle of a fight.     
 I always finish my fights.     
 [INDISTINCT RADIO TRANSMISSION]     
 LILA: What's going on?     
 MAN: Stay here.     
 [DOOR CLOSES]     
 [BOTH GRUNTING]     
 [INDISTINCT RADIO TRANSMISSION]     
 SOLDIER: Set a perimeter. We'll get a roadblock down there.     
 These are the rules.     
 You stay glued to my side at all times, all right?     
 If you have any more of those flashes, you tell me first,     
 not Guilder.     
 That guy is bad news.     
 And this is important.     
 Even when things get scary, we stay calm, got it?     
 That's a lot of rules.     
 SOLDIER: Sir, there's another body over here.     
 - Stay back. Stay back. 
- Well, you just said,     
 "Stay glued to my side."     
 Yeah, and now I'm telling you to stay back! Just listen to me.     
 I am listening.     
 He's an efficient killer, I'll give him that.     
 Can we just go ahead and say "vampire"?     
 RICHARDS: All right, secure the area.     
 Was someone else in the car?     
 Son of a bitch.     
 What the hell is this?     
 You were bringing Lila here?     
 She was a liability.     
 You never should have gotten her involved.     
 [GRUNTING]: Son of a bitch.     
 How much damage are you gonna be responsible for?     
 [GRUNTING]     
 It's all right. Let him go.     
 I swear to God, if anything happens to Lila...     
 You're gonna murder me?     
 Shoot me in the face? I got it.     
 WOLGAST: I made the choice to get involved with this,     
 - and she's innocent. 
- RICHARDS: No, she's not.     
 GUILDER: We're looking for Winston, Agent,     
 not your wife.     
 I just saw something.     
 Didn't I say to talk to me first?     
 GUILDER: What'd you see, Amy?     
 Trees. A cabin. A lady.     
 Tree, cabin and a lady.     
 Can you dial that in any further?     
 It's this way.     
 - Come on. 
- No, Amy, stop! Stop!     
 Oh, she's fast.     
 I wonder why.     
 [CRICKETS CHIRPING]     
 What was it like when you were sick?     
 You mean when I lost my mind?     
 - Yeah. 
- Hmm.     
 Well, it's like you... you lost everything.     
 You know, first your keys,     
 then your... wallet, your phone,     
 and then everyone you care about.     
 You.     
 It was like there was this big hole where my life used to be.     
 It was just...     
 filled with fear and... panic.     
 Oh, and then Tim came to me.     
 What did he say?     
 You're not surprised.     
 No.     
 Um, he said...     
 [CHUCKLES]: he said he was gonna save me.     
 [TAKES DEEP BREATH]     
 Hey. Jonas?     
 I've done a lot of research into this hideous disease.     
 No one has ever come back from Alzheimer's.     
 What is it that you want to tell me?     
 Do you remember...     
 the Bolivia expedition?     
 Hold it. Wait.     
 - What did I tell you?! 
- Why are you yelling at me?     
 I'm yelling because you're not listening to me!     
 I told you to stay close.     
 Did you see what Winston did to that guy?     
 No, because you didn't let me see.     
 Well, it was terrible. Amy, please,     
 you have to do what I say.     
 Why? You're not my dad.     
 You're just some guy that tried to kidnap me.     
 GUILDER: I hate to interrupt     
 this daddy-daughter-agent- foster kid teaching moment,     
 but we got to keep moving. Amy, are you all right?     
 Yeah, I'm good.     
 It's this way.     
 Those alarms you heard were set off     
 because one of the virals escaped.     
 Are you gonna say anything?     
 I'm trying to imagine writing a character     
 who finds out she's...     
 been rescued from Alzheimer's     
 by a serum that will turn her into an immortal     
 blood-drinking thing in    hours.     
 And what she would say to her husband.     
 'Cause what you're s-saying is...     
 is insane.     
 Jonas, please.     
 Tell me you're... you're messing with me.     
 I couldn't let you go.     
 Well, apparently, you're gonna have to pretty soon.     
 I went to Tim Fanning's funeral.     
 I watched you eulogize him.     
 What was in that casket?     
 - How could you even... 
- Elizabeth...     
 No. No, no, no, don't.     
 And after...     
 after Tim, you gave the virus to    death row inmates,     
 one of whom is...     
 running loose...     
 and a child.     
 A little girl.     
 Look, every step of this felt like...     
 like we were so close, like...     
 like it could be the last.     
 Well, it certainly feels like the end now.     
 LEAR:  Grey infected Elizabeth with the virus.   
 - What? 
- It was Fanning. He has control over him.     
 The guards have the footage.     
 They put Grey in holding.     
 I got to start her on the antivirals,     
 - get ahead of the-the decline. 
- I have another idea.     
 It's a reach.     
 - Okay. Tell me. 
- I looked at surveillance     
 of Winston's escape.     
 When he attacked Agent Wolgast,     
 Amy screamed, and when she screamed,     
 Fanning's power flatlined in our E.M. data.     
 Are you saying Amy's more powerful than Fanning?     
 Well, it's possible.     
 We've made all the viruses from Fanning thus far.     
 Let's make one from Amy's blood and use that against Fanning's.     
 - Crowd out Fanning's virus? 
- Precisely.     
 Amy's altered virus could overwhelm Fanning's,     
 and maybe we can prevent Elizabeth's turn     
 and keep the Alzheimer's at bay.     
 That's a good idea.     
 Thank you, Nichole.     
 Okay.     
 [SNARLING]     
 FANNING:  Winston!   
 We had a plan, Winston.     
 [CHUCKLES] Yeah, your plan?     
 Well, I saw a way out, and I took it.     
 What? Anyone would have.     
 We were this close,     
 you dumb, sadistic hillbilly!     
 Carter was   .     
 I was hungry.     
 Did you even think about how this is gonna end for you?     
 Nobody can stop me out here.     
 Now, come on, you were right.     
 I'm at the top of the food chain.     
 It's good to be the king.     
 Well, you've had a few too many drinks, Winston.     
 It's gone to your head.     
 'Cause that little girl...     
 is tracking you,     
 and she's leading them right to you.     
 And I'm trying to find a way to get you back in the fold     
 and put us back on track,     
 but you need to find a way     
 to kill the girl before she finds you.     
 Kill her?     
 Oh, really? I mean, come on,     
 I-I... I thought she was family.     
 Ain't she one of us?     
 I don't know what the hell she is,     
 but she's not playing for our team, so figure it out.     
 [GROWLS]     
 No.     
 Yes.  The Fly...   
 and pizza.     
 The original or Cronenberg?     
 Cronenberg. I did my homework.     
 Oh, my God.     
 Thank you.     
 Yeah, well, I don't know how you got me to do that.     
 Well, enjoy.     
 You're not staying?     
 I told you, I don't like horror movies. And besides,     
 - I have work to do. 
- Come on.     
 I am your work.     
 You got to be bored out of your mind here, too.     
 There's what, like, five other women who work here?     
 Come on, stay for the first ten minutes.     
 Have a piece of pizza.     
 You have had pizza before, right?     
 Ten minutes.

 So, what'd you think?     
 Well, I am filled with dread and nausea,     
 and I wish I could unsee that,     
 - so thanks, Shauna. 
- [CLICKS OFF TV]     
 Hey, what's this?     
 You've got a semicolon tattoo.     
 It's nothing.     
 Mine was kind of half-assed.     
 I chased a handful of Tylenol down with some vodka,     
 but I knew my mom was coming home soon.     
 I was   .     
 Mine wasn't half-assed.     
 It was serious.     
 I was   .     
 Well, I'm glad you made it.     
 You, too.     
 An overdose of Tylenol can be fatal.     
 Nothing half-assed about that.     
 Hey, you want to do me another favor?     
 Now that we're botched suicide sisters.     
 What now?     
 [KNOCKING]     
 LILA: Hello?     
 Hello?     
 [GROANS WEAKLY]     
 Okay.     
 Okay, hang on, hang on.     
 All right. I'm coming.     
 Just stay with me.     
 Ow.     
 Okay, you're okay. Just stay with me.     
 [MARGO GROANING]     
 Hey. How's it going?     
 I've introduced Amy's virus to Fanning's.     
 I'm hoping hers will kick the crap out of his shortly.     
 Any word on Winston?     
 They're tracking him.     
 And two dead so far.     
 [LEAR EXHALES]     
 How's Elizabeth?     
 She's bewildered,     
 angry...     
 terrified.     
 Jonas, we'll find a way.     
 We'll help her.     
 Her mind was...     
 dismantled by a disease, and now that she's come back     
 only to discover that... [SIGHS]     
 her reprieve...     
 was just a preamble to something so much worse.     
 I did this.     
 We did this.     
 I've been here from the beginning.     
 I mean, what are we expecting from these creatures?     
 We know what they're capable of. Winston's already out there.     
 The risks are unacceptable. How can Guilder not see this?     
 How can the Department of Defense not see this?     
 Jonas, stop.     
 Let's help Elizabeth.     
 [EXHALES]     
 Let me finish what I'm doing, okay?     
 Go back to your wife.     
 Hey.     
 I need a field clearance for tonight     
 for about three hours.     
 Purpose?     
 Going to a movie.     
 Really?     
 What's "really" about it?     
 Nothing.     
 Uh, and you're the head of medical.     
 You actually don't need my clearance, Major Sykes.     
 We've been here over two years.     
 You can call me Nichole.     
 Okay.     
 Only if you call me Clark.     
 Uh, what movie are you going to see?     
 Um,  A Quiet Place.  Yeah.     
 Shauna Babcock wants me to go see it and tell her about it.     
 You guys have been getting close.     
 Are you sure that's a good idea?     
 No, no, it's a terrible idea,     
 but... it's what's happening.     
 Um, it's a scary movie.     
 [LAUGHS SOFTLY]     
 Would you like some company, Nichole?     
 Oh. Oh.     
 - Oh. 
- Hey.     
 - Hey, hey, easy, easy. 
- Oh. Oh.     
 - Oh. 
- You need to be still,     
 or else the wound's gonna start bleeding again.     
 I feel amazing.     
 I do.     
 - I really do. 
- You lost so much blood.     
 Two and a half cups flour.     
 - Your wound has healed. 
- One and a half cups butter.     
 That's one and a half sticks of butter     
 cut into little pieces. Put it in the food processor bowl.     
 One teaspoon of salt.     
 One teaspoon of sugar.     
 Pulse. Pulse.     
 [SCREECHING]     
 No!     
 - Hey! 
- [SCREECHING]     
 WOLGAST: Lila!     
 - RICHARDS: Give me the light. 
- [SCREECHING]     
 Just so we're clear, it's worse than we thought     
 because they can make more of themselves?     
 Same thing happened with Fanning in Bolivia.     
 This is a disaster.     
 LILA: Yeah.     
 That you created.     
 What happened to you, Clark?     
 I mean, what the hell     
 are you people doing?     
 RICHARDS: You shouldn't even be here.     
 LILA: This is a crime...     
 GUILDER: It's about to get a whole lot worse     
 if we don't get back on track.     
 We got to find Winston.     
 Any ideas, kid?     
 Clocks.     
 Pipes.     
 Water.     
 This is so damn wonderful.     
 You are a marvel.     
 RICHARDS: Clocks.     
 Do you mean, um, water gauges?     
 Uh, flow meters?     
 I don't know what those are.     
 There's a...     
 there's a pumping station a few klicks west.     
 That might be what she means.     
 Well, all right. Let's go.     
 [INDISTINCT CHATTER IN DISTANCE]     
 FANNING: Hello, kiddo.     
 [ELIZABETH EXHALES]     
 Hi.     
 Are you here,     
 or am I somewhere else?     
 That's a good question.     
 Doesn't matter, really.     
 I just wanted to check in on you and see how you're feeling.     
 How do you think I'm feeling?     
 Better, I hope.     
 I mean, the whole point of this endeavor,     
 of the Bolivia expedition     
 and Project Noah, the tests on  B...     
 That was always to save you.     
 To free you from the-the prison of your own mind.     
 And we did it.     
 I did it.     
 But it, it's temporary, Tim.     
 No, I assure you, it is not.     
 Lizzy, my mind is sharp.     
 My mind is... [LAUGHS]     
 it's powerful, and it's pretty great.     
 - You're not in pain? 
- No.     
 I feel incredible.     
 And I'm very optimistic about the future.     
 'Cause you think that Jonas will find a cure?     
 [LAUGHS] Oh, hell no.     
 No, Lizzy, the virus was the cure.     
 It's the cure for humanity and...     
 ...all of its imperfections. What?     
 - It's just me. 
- No.     
 No, it's not.     
 Okay.     
 What did Jonas tell you about all of us down on  B?     
 He called you monsters.     
 No, the monsters are the doctors that imprison us.     
 The monsters are the Mengeles.     
 The monsters are the doctors in Tuskegee.     
 The monsters are Jonas and Sykes.     
 We are not the monsters.     
 We started off as victims.     
 But now...     
 now we're the lucky ones.     
 How am I lucky?     
 Sweetheart,     
 you have a passport     
 that is stamped     
 for a spectacular future.     
 And not everyone's invited to the party.     
 [LILA SIGHS]     
 
 
 
 You know what that bite was?     
 That was first transmission.     
 One viral that can infect an infinite number of people.     
 That's a highly contagious virus.     
 I know, it's bad.     
 Brad, it's catastrophic.     
 What's going on with Amy?     
 - Is she symptom-free? 
- No.     
 Hell no. She's connected to the rest of them somehow.     
 She's stronger, faster. Psychic.     
 She's not listening to me.     
 Well, that's not the virus.     
 - That's puberty. 
- I know.     
 Which is also catastrophic.     
 I'm trying to protect her, and suddenly I'm the enemy.     
 She's had a lot of decisions made for her.     
 She just wants control over her life.     
 We never got this far with Eva.     
 RICHARDS: Hey.     
 Pumping station's about a hundred yards ahead.     
 Keep your eyes open.     
 I'm sorry I got you into this.     
 They have the coordinates.     
 Soon as you can.     
 My team's almost here.     
 We can't wait on them.     
 If he's in there,     
 we got to move now.     
 All right, wonder kid.     
 Is he in there?     
 He's in there.     
 Come on.     
 RICHARDS: Get a shot, right here.     
 Amy, you're staying here.     
 No. Why?     
 Because I don't want anything terrible to happen to you.     
 Something terrible's already happened to me.     
 You kidnapped me.     
 They put the virus in me.     
 And I want my book back!     
 That's the only thing I had left!     
 My mom gave it to me.     
 RICHARDS: Wolgast.     
 Plan's changed. You're in.     
 All right.     
 Okay, this is the plan. Okay, just give me the walkie,     
 and we're gonna stay out here and be on lookout.     
 Cool?     
 All right.     
 Let's move out.     
 Hey.     
 She's too smart     
 to fall for your act.     
 I don't know.     
 Think we're getting along pretty good.     
 [BALL BOUNCING]   
 Were the monsters CGI, or were they practical?     
 I have no idea what that means.     
 Did they seem computer-made     
 or like somebody made them by hand?     
 Oh, definitely computer-made.     
 But they didn't have any eyes.     
 They had all these limbs     
 and ears in the worst way.     
 I have a question     
 about what we talked about last time.     
 Well, that's too bad,     
 'cause I'm not gonna discuss it with you.     
 I'm not gonna ask you     
 about your serious suicide attempt.     
 - Good. 
- I want to know why you chose     
 to join the military and work on an isolated mountaintop     
 in the loneliest place on Earth.     
 For me, surviving was a second chance.     
 You know, I...     
 I wanted to do something important.     
 Something good.     
 So here we are.     
 There was a time I wanted to die.     
 But now all I want to do is live.     
 Which is why I took this sketchy deal.     
 [SIGHS] Look, I know     
 there were people here before me.     
 Someone named Winston scratched his name     
 into the wall behind the bed.     
 So I've just been wondering...     
 what happened to those guys?     
 What happened to Winston?     
 Shauna, you're doing great.     
 You're young. You're strong.     
 Your body is responding really well to the medicine.     
 I am so hopeful.     
 You didn't answer the question.     
 I'm your doctor.     
 Whatever happens, I'm gonna be with you every step of the way.     
 Okay?     
 Okay.     
 [DOOR CLOSES]     
 - RICHARDS: Hands up. Turn around. 
- [SNARLS]     
 SOLDIER: Viral!     
 WOLGAST: It's not Winston.     
 GUILDER: There could be more.     
 [COMPUTER CHIRPS]     
 Damn it.     
 It's not working, is it?     
 [CLICKS TONGUE] That's a shame.     
 You worked real hard.     
 Hi, Shauna. I was wondering when you'd get here.     
 I was wondering the same thing about you.     
 You were my doctor,     
 you were my friend.     
 But as soon as I turned,     
 it was like none of that happened.     
 Like none of that mattered.     
 Of course it mattered.     
 You talked a big game about being there for me     
 no matter what.     
 Instead, you abandoned me.     
 I'm sorry, Shauna, your brain scans...     
 I really didn't think you were there anymore.     
 I've had a lot of time to think about you     
 and our doctor-patient relationship.     
 And you know what I think?     
 You're a bad person.     
 You're the worst kind of bad person,     
 because you think you're good.     
 You knew what you were getting into.     
 Is this doing good in the world, Nichole?     
 Is this why you survived?     
 Is that the story you tell yourself at night?     
 Whatever you're doing to Clark Richards, knock it off.     
 I'm not doing anything to him that he doesn't want done.     
 You're not gonna find a cure, by the way.     
 You're not gonna save me,     
 you're not gonna save Elizabeth, and you're not gonna save Amy.     
 - Stay away from her. 
- No.     
 She's ours, Nichole.     
 - Stop it. 
- You stop it.     
 Stop trying. Stop lying.     
 Stop pretending like you're gonna get out of this alive.     
 None of you are getting out of this alive.     
 What do you want from me?     
 I want everything you have.     
 I want this lab.     
 I want Project Noah.     
 I want your boyfriend.     
 I want everything that matters to you to be mine.     
 And when I have it all in hand,     
 I want to know what you taste like.     
 [SCREECHES]     
 The, um...     
 the overwhelm process didn't work.     
 Fanning's virus wins every time.     
 He visited Elizabeth.     
 He told her that he sees the virals as...     
 a cure for humanity.     
 Who did you see just now?     
 Babcock.     
 They're gonna kill us all.     
 I should have killed him in Bolivia.     
 You didn't know what was gonna happen.     
 Doesn't matter anymore.     
 I'm the author of this horror.     
 Too many innocent people have died.     
 Babcock's right.     
 They are gonna kill us.     
 So let's beat 'em to it.     
 - They were people once. 
- I know.     
 Fanning was my best friend.     
 I'm gonna kill him anyway.     
 I'm gonna kill them all.     
 Are you in?     
 Yeah.     
 I'm in.
