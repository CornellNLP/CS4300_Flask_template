 Previously on The Passage  
  BABCOCK: We're coming to the end here. 
  - The girl is sick. 
  - SYKES: She's in the turn. 
  The anti-viral is the only thing that can save her. 
  You will look back on this with searing regret. 
  CARTER: Is this the way you saw your career, Dr. Lear? 
  Using human beings as lab rats? 
  I'm the author of this horror. 
  LEAR: The risks are unacceptable. 
  How can the Department of Defense not see this? 
  - What are you gonna do? 
  - LEAR: I'm gonna kill him. 
  I'm gonna kill them all. 
  BABCOCK: If you want safe passage, you need me. 
  You're a monster and I will kill you. 
  GUILDER: The virals, they're all connected. 
  They have a hive mind, and they're all linked to Fanning. 
  - FANNING: We need 12. 
  - She's not your 12th. 
  - FANNING: Amy will turn. 
  - CARTER: She's better off dead. 
  As of today, you're all relieved of duty. 
  - You're making a terrible mistake. 
  - Go pack your bags. 
  - How do we override? 
  - Guilder. 
  [GUN CLICKS] 
  SYKES: Grey locked me in the lab. 
  No! 
  [GRUNTS] 
  GUILDER: Grey! 
  You'll kill us all! 
  What the hell are you doing? 
  WOLGAST: What does Fanning want? 
  - [GASPS] 
  - Amy. 
  LEAR: What any prisoner wants To be free. 
  Here we go. 
  SYKES: The cages are open. 
  AMY: We have to go. 
  [INDISTINCT CHATTER] 
  Just stay away from him, all right? 
  [HELICOPTER BLADES WHIRRING] 
  AMY: I didn't used to believe in monsters, but I do now. 
  [INDISTINCT SHOUTING] 
  RICHARDS: Jonas. 
  Chopper's ready. 
  We need to go. 
  What's the situation outside? 
  The locals say they want us to kill him, before he kills all of us. 
  That's Tim. 
  He needs our help. 
  - I'm just the messenger here. 
  - [SCOFFS] 
  [INDISTINCT SHOUTING CONTINUES] 
  Guess I shouldn't have skipped my vaccines, huh? 
  Think customs will clear me? 
  Hey, don't worry, buddy. 
  We're flying private. 
  This is ridiculous, you gotta end it now. 
  LEAR: I got a team of doctors back in the States. 
  You're gonna be okay. 
  I'm gonna help you. 
  Shoot me. 
  No. 
  [WHIMPERING] 
  Jonas. 
  [SNIFFS] 
  You saw that thing in the cave, right? 
  [GROANS] 
  Something's happening to me. 
  I'm changing. 
  It's not good. 
  Come on. 
  AMY: There were so many times they could have turned back. 
  That they could've said "stop. 
  " But they didn't. 
  By the time anybody bothered to try, it was too late. 
  - [POUNDING ON DOOR] 
  - [VIRALS SCREECHING] 
  We need to get out of here. 
  We got to get back upstairs. 
  Come on, come on. 
  Come on! 
  We're not bringing her. 
  Listen to me, we don't know what she is yet. 
  We do know what she is. 
  She's Amy. 
  They woke up because of her. 
  Is he right? 
  Is that true? 
  Do you want to drink my blood? 
  Deep down inside? 
  Even a little? 
  - No. 
  - Then we're good. 
  Let's go. 
  You can stay put if you want. 
  [POUNDING CONTINUES] 
  What's the holdup? 
  We need to get down there. 
  The car was immobilized on 4B when the cellblock went into lockdown. 
  Override the damn thing. 
  I'm trying. 
  Guilder's team reset all the security permissions. 
  Everything's a mess. 
  Lila! 
  - Oh, my God. 
  Are you okay? 
  - Yeah. 
  What happened? 
  Some guy hit me in the head. 
  Sykes has the anti-viral for Amy. 
  But she's locked in the lab. 
  She's okay, she made it through the turn. 
  [METAL CLANKING] 
  I'm assuming that pounding is bad news. 
  Yeah, the virals are out of their cages. 
  I think it's my fault. 
  None of this is your fault. 
  Right now we have to go. 
  Here. 
  Untie them. 
  Richards. 
  We have three soldiers and a med tech down here with us. 
  Sykes is locked in the lab. 
  Can you help? 
  RICHARDS [OVER RADIO]: We can't get to you yet. 
  The elevator's stuck down on your level. 
  It's the only way on or off of 4B, but we're gonna get to you, you just gotta get to the security lobby. 
  [VIRALS SNARLING] 
  [POUNDING ON DOOR] 
  WOLGAST: All right, gear up. 
  Quickly. 
  We got to free Sykes and get to the lobby. 
  Secure the cellblock door. 
  Ready, guys? 
  Let's get her out. 
  Richards. 
  The cellblock door's not gonna hold the virals much longer. 
  LEAR [OVER RADIO] 
 : Wolgast, what happened? 
  The gas should have been enough to keep the virals unconscious. 
  Amy's fever broke. 
  She didn't turn into one of them, but the other virals woke up with her. 
  It's 12. 
  That's what Fanning wanted, a hive mind of 12 virals, and now he has it with Amy. 
  You heard Wolgast. 
  The virals are gonna get out unless we put a stop to it. 
  We're not doing that. 
  Not yet. 
  We put the protocol in place for this exact situation. 
  Jonas, we're not detonating explosives with our own people down there. 
  Nor can we let the entire world suffer for our mistakes. 
  And we won't. 
  We need to give Sykes and Wolgast a chance. 
  MAN 1: Let's go, guys. 
  MAN 2: Hold the door. 
  MAN 1: Push! 
  MAN 2: This thing's a fortress. 
  [MEN GRUNTING] 
  [METAL CLANKING] 
  FANNING: Amy? 
  We're waiting for you. 
  What do you want? 
  I want you to meet the family. 
  No, thank you. 
  Can I tell you a little secret? 
  Okay. 
  I like you the best. 
  And when I say family, I mean that literally. 
  Because my blood flows through your veins, as it does with every one of the 12. 
  So do you know what that means? 
  That means we're stuck with each other. 
  Your family is trapped in the cellblock and we need you! 
  You're not my family! 
  Amy. 
  Come on, sweetie, stay by us. 
  [CLANKING CONTINUES] 
  DRIVER: This is as far as I go. 
  WOMAN: Thanks for the lift. 
  DRIVER: Good luck out there. 
  [INSECTS CHIRRING] 
  [VIRALS SNARLING] 
  [POUNDING ON DOOR] 
  TECH: I need to reboot the system. 
  What does that look like? 
  Power down. 
  Computers go into safe mode. 
  Elevators work. 
  All right, get on it. 
  Hey, I need you to check the other security terminal. 
  Okay. 
  Sykes, we can't shoot through the glass, but maybe we can pry the entire panel out. 
  - There isn't enough time. 
  - GUILDER [OVER RADIO]: Wolgast. 
  They're really picking up pace. 
  Maybe I should drop back to the elevator. 
  Hold your position, Guilder. 
  [VIRALS SCREECHING] 
  - [POUNDING STOPS] 
  - [LOW GROWLING] 
  They've stopped. 
  Something's happening, I don't like it. 
  Brad, good news. 
  We're gonna reboot the system, get the elevator working. 
  Richards. 
  It's quiet down here, where are they? 
  Stand by. 
  Rebooting. 
  Take Amy and get out of here. 
  Just go. 
  We can figure this out. 
  I said go! 
  [INDISTINCT CHATTER] 
  What the hell? 
  [CREAKING OVERHEAD] 
  [LOW GROWLING] 
  - Run! 
  - MAN: Go, go! 
  They're in the air ducts. 
  RICHARDS [OVER RADIO]: Nichole, just sit tight, we're gonna find a way. 
  Don't. 
  After Amy gets up that elevator, bury these monsters. 
  Bury all of it. 
  TECH: We got it. 
  Elevator's unlocked. 
  RICHARDS: Brad, the doors are open. 
  Get on the elevator. 
  WOLGAST: Go! 
  Get to the elevator! 
  Go! 
  [PEOPLE SCREAMING] 
  - [GASPS, SCREAMS] 
  - [VIRAL SCREECHES] 
  Go! 
  [SCREAMS] 
  [GASPS] 
  [SCREAMS]: No! 
  [CARTER PANTING] 
  - [SNARLS] 
  - [SCREAMING] 
  Carter, don't hurt her! 
  No! 
  No! 
  [SNARLS] 
  [GROWLING] 
  [SCREECHING] 
  [ALL SNARLING] 
  - GUILDER: Get in! 
  - [PANTING] 
  Show me. 
  Show me! 
  We both know what this means. 
  - You're getting on that elevator. 
  - No. 
  I am infected. 
  No! 
  I love you. 
  I'm not gonna lose you again. 
  Sykes has a cure in the lab. 
  I'll fix this. 
  Take care of her. 
  [SCREECHING, SNARLING] 
  [MUFFLED SCREECHING, SNARLING] 
  [SCREECHING CONTINUES] 
  [SNARLING IN DISTANCE] 
  [EXHALES] 
  [GROANS] 
  [INDISTINCT RADIO CHATTER] 
  GUILDER: Okay, so, she's infected, I mean, shouldn't she be restrained? 
  Or, frankly, shot? 
  Guilder, shut up. 
  Clark, he's right. 
  We know what happens next. 
  Well, that's bravery talking right there. 
  Guilder, I will rip that mustache off your face and feed it to you if you say another word. 
  Brad is gonna come back. 
  He's gonna bring you the cure. 
  Brad Wolgast is as good as dead. 
  All right. 
  Deep breath. 
  So you say that Fanning, he took you to a tunnel? 
  He told me to go through it. 
  It was scary, but I went the other way instead. 
  Rode right past him. 
  Why are you smiling? 
  Because you did it. 
  You, um You came through your turn in perfect health. 
  Are you sure? 
  I can still hear him. 
  His blood is still in me. 
  So if he dies, I die, right? 
  There's still a lot we don't understand, but there's one thing I do know. 
  Fanning took his best shot at you, and you told him to go to hell. 
  RICHARDS: Nichole, slight change of plans. 
  Wolgast is on his way to you. 
  What? 
  No. 
  Is he trying to get himself killed? 
  Amy is up here safe, but Lila got infected on the way out. 
  She needs your antiviral serum. 
  [SIGHS] 
  Hey. 
  You want to hear something crazy? 
  News just broke out of Switzerland. 
  Apparently, they cracked the vaccine for the bird flu pandemic. 
  Great. 
  [LAUGHING] 
  That's great. 
  God, remember the avian flu? 
  Those were the days. 
  I know. 
  Now we just need your cure for the vampire flu. 
  [LAUGHING] 
  [EXHALES] 
  Hey, um, how 'bout you stay on the line but we talk about anything else? 
  Here they are, sir. 
  Hey. 
  How about an activity? 
  I'm gonna show you how to hot-wire the security panel for the airlock. 
  Is this a "cut the red wire" thing? 
  No, it's actually a "cut the green wire, splice it with the yellow, twist it around the red. 
  " Come on, you're getting a little ahead of yourself. 
  I just want you to find a screwdriver. 
  Okay. 
  Why didn't they just kill me? 
  Why? 
  Why? 
  [SOBS] 
  [INDISTINCT CHATTER] 
  Now, it's gonna be a live wire, so I want you to be really careful when you're cutting it. 
  Okay, there are 12 wires. 
  Perfect. 
  It's the fourth wire from the left. 
  What color is that? 
  It's red. 
  Well, what do you know? 
  You were right all along. 
  What happens if I cut - the wrong wire? 
  - Well, nothing's gonna explode, if that's what you're asking. 
  Now, I just need you to remove the insulation from that wire and you're gonna twist it around the yellow wire. 
  Hey, once we get this door open, how are we getting out of here? 
  [EXHALES] 
  I'm working on that. 
  Just one problem at a time. 
  Okay, the wires are connected. 
  Now, hold down the override button. 
  You're gonna take the exposed end of the wire and you're gonna connect it to the negative power terminal. 
  [BUZZES] 
  We got it! 
  - [SCREECHES] 
  - [GASPS] 
  [PANTING] 
  Okay, Nichole, now, what kind of firepower do you have? 
  [SNARLS] 
  Nichole.

  [GROWLING SOFTLY] 
  Hi, I just thought I would check in, see how you're doing. 
  Okay. 
  What would you like to hear? 
  It's up to you. 
  You're brand-new to begging for survival in the face of arbitrary cruelty, so try some things on. 
  I'm too tired for games, Shauna. 
  Why are you stalling? 
  I thought you wanted to know what I taste like. 
  Why were you nice to me? 
  - What? 
  - Were you that nice to all of us? 
  You're asking me this now? 
  No. 
  The ones who came before you scared the hell out of me. 
  They were the worst humanity had to offer. 
  And I was different? 
  Yeah, Shauna, you're different. 
  How? 
  You were smart and funny. 
  And, in another world, we could have been friends. 
  And you weren't a cruel, amoral, psychotic murderer, and I still don't think you're one now either. 
  Fanning wants us to go out and eat the world. 
  Just, like, grab people and drink 'em. 
  Like, moms and dads and kids. 
  You know, nice families, not crappy ones. 
  Innocent people. 
  It just seems like a lot. 
  It does. 
  Maybe there's another way.

  SYKES: Shauna, no! 
  - [PANTING] 
  - WOLGAST: Sykes, stay down. 
  [SCREECHING] 
  - [PANTING] 
  - You ready to get out of here? 
  Yeah. 
  [PANTS] 
  Richards, I have Sykes. 
  We have the anti-viral. 
  We're heading to the elevator. 
  Whoa, whoa, whoa. 
  Not yet. 
  You need to stay put. 
  You need to find a safe place to hide. 
  I've got one, but you're not gonna like it. 
  [BEEPING] 
  Brad, I'm seeing the virals have moved away from the elevator. 
  Do you have eyes on them? 
  Affirmative. 
  I have eyes on all of 'em. 
  We're in Fanning's cell. 
  Can you help us out? 
  [VIRALS SNARLING, HISSING] 
  [SNARLING, HISSING] 
  [GROWLS] 
  [SCREECHES] 
  Richards, these things are real ugly. 
  Can you get us out of here? 
  Stand by. 
  I want you to pull up the layout for the retrofit. 
  There's got to be another way off of 4B. 
  [INDISTINCT CHATTER] 
  They're surrounded in there. 
  Look, Wolgast and Sykes are gonna die. 
  You need to start those input codes now. 
  We gave them as much time as we could. 
  - Jonas. 
  - It's too dangerous to wait. 
  We have to end this now. 
  You need to pay attention to what they're saying, 'cause it affects you. 
  Sorry about earlier. 
  I shouldn't have yelled. 
  But it's been a crazy day. 
  I hate you. 
  You know, I've been waiting for three years in that cell for this day to come. 
  - I don't care. 
  - It's been such a mess since Bolivia. 
  We underestimated the virus, and Jonas, he wanted to just go ahead. 
  - He should have stopped. 
  - I know, right? 
  You got to let it go. 
  He forgot that stopping was even an option, but he did put in a contingency plan in case it all went sideways. 
  - Why are you telling me this? 
  - 'Cause that's what they're talking about, Amy. 
  It's a bomb to blow up 4B. 
  You know what they're calling it? 
  The Elizabeth Protocol. 
  I mean, does that sound romantic to you? 
  'Cause it sounds morbid to me. 
  But Jonas, he's ready to press that button right now. 
  - He wouldn't do that with the agent down there. 
  - Yeah, he would. 
  He would do anything to end his guilt. 
  He would kill the agent in a heartbeat, because killing me is gonna make him very happy. 
  But guess what? 
  If I die, you die. 
  Maybe, maybe not. 
  Come on, you know that's the truth, Amy. 
  You need to stop them from using that bomb. 
  Will you do it? 
  How many times has the agent saved you? 
  You could return the favor. 
  RICHARDS: When they retrofitted the old cellblock, there was a a ventilation shaft that they used to survey the foundation. 
  You want to use that to get them off 4B? 
  There's no way off of 4B. 
  That's the whole point of 4B! 
  - Guilder  
  - GUILDER: Haven't you done enough for 'em? 
  This needs to end. 
  RICHARDS: What we need is to get our people safe. 
  GUILDER: What about the rest of the people? 
  Don't they matter? 
  RICHARDS: They deserve the chance. 
  [VOICES ECHOING] 
  [DOOR OPENS, CLOSES] 
  Hey, friend. 
  You can't hide here forever. 
  You know what you have to do. 
  Why do I have to be the one to fix this? 
  That's the way it is. 
  It's too hard. 
  You're stronger than you know. 
  It's not fair the way this all went down. 
  I hate that it's on your shoulders. 
  But somebody has to stop us. 
  And no matter what you do there will be sorrow. 
  Yours or the world's. 
  I can't. 
 
 
 
  [CRYING]: I can't do it. 
  You have to. 
  I feel it now Detonate that bomb, now before it's too late! 
  There's no escape [GRUNTS] 
  GUILDER: Have you lost your mind? 
  LEAR: Fanning's gonna destroy the world unless we stop him! 
  You don't get to call this because you feel guilty. 
  Isn't that what you're doing? 
  You get one step closer and I will shoot you, too. 
  - GUILDER: Guys. 
  - I am not letting you kill those people. 
  The tide, it breaks [VOICES ECHOING] 
  My fragile frame Shadows will raid This heavy Ground The world is against me And the waters are Rising The world is Against me And the darkness Is blinding But I [ECHOING]: Just relax, Richards. 
  Sykes was the one who started this. 
  We don't get to kill her. 
  I'll be here And I will fight Fight to the end.

  RICHARDS: Yeah. 
  You've got less than two minutes before 4B blows. 
  If Fanning dies, Amy dies! 
  Who pushed the button? 
  [ALARM CONTINUES BEEPING] 
  Amy did. 
  [SCREECHES] 
  [ALARM BEEPING] 
  MAN: Richards. 
  - Found something. 
  - [TAPS KEYBOARD] 
  Brad. 
  We just found your exit. 
  Leave the cell. 
  Turn left. 
  There's an unmarked access panel on the far wall. 
  [ELECTRIC CRACKLING] 
  [PANTS]: Oh, I see it! 
  The panel is right here. 
  Clark, we found the panel. 
  Climb fast. 
  Nichole, you've got two virals closing in. 
  [SCREECHING, HISSING] 
  It's clear. 
  Let's go. 
  RICHARDS: 20 seconds. 
  Come on. 
  Save your wife. 
  Get the last dose to the CDC. 
  - And take care of Amy. 
  - Let's go, Sykes! 
  - [SNARLING NEARBY] 
  - It has to be me. 
  There isn't enough time. 
  Just go! 
  RICHARDS: 15 seconds. 
  - [GROWLING] 
  - SYKES: Go! 
  Go! 
  Hey, Clark I know what you're gonna say. 
  I love you, Nichole. 
  - [SNARLING, GROWLING] 
  - I love you, too. 
  See you around. 
  Hey, open it up! 
  I'm coming up. 
  Open! 
  - Richards. 
  - [GRUNTING] 
  Come on. 
  Let's go!

  Richards, let's go.

  [TAKES DEEP BREATH] 
  LEAR: It's remarkable. 
  Sykes did it. 
  She did it. 
  I'm Dr. 
  Jonas Lear. 
  You're gonna be okay. 
  Hi. 
  You made it. 
  - I told you I would. 
  - Mm. 
  - You okay? 
  - Mm-hmm. 
  Amy took great care of me. 
  I'm sorry. 
  Stop. 
  You're the bravest person I've ever met. 
  So the virals are buried on 4B. 
  Is there any confirmation of that? 
  Trackers are down, but the bomb went off. 
  And Amy's still alive. 
  Tisdale, this is Richards. 
  You at the elevator? 
  [RADIO STATIC] 
  Tisdale, what's your status? 
  [RADIO STATIC] 
  What's wrong? 
  I can hear them. 
  They're alive. 
  And they're coming for us. 
  RICHARDS [OVER RADIO]: Team A, do you copy? 
  Alpha team? 
  Does anyone copy? 
  [GROWLING, HISSING] 
  FANNING: It's over, Jonas. 
  You lost. 
  Now send me the girl, and I'll be out of your hair forever. 
  Got six virals covering the exits. 
  The others are out there, too. 
  How many men do you have left? 
  We've got ten. 
  Maybe a dozen more civilians, but I have no idea who can fire a gun. 
  Hey. 
  I got you into this mess. 
  Least I can do is get you out. 
  Thanks. 
  Ramirez, we're gonna link up - at the north exit right now. 
  - Hey. 
  You make sure this gets to the CDC. 
  But remember, Amy has to be your first priority. 
  I think Fanning's afraid of her. 
  Someday she could be strong enough to fight him. 
  Will do. 
  All right, let's go. 
  Stay close.
