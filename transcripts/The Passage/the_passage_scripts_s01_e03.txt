 You have the opportunity to take part in a drug trial.   
 Everything is okay if you just do what he says.

- This is Amy Bellafonte.   
 Hi.   
 You won't be safe   
 until the public knows what you know   
 about Project Noah.   
 Take cover. Stay low.    
 Lacey.    
 You don't leave me, I don't leave you.    
 SIMMONS:  Maybe she's a good girl after all.

 Lot of the guys are having nightmares.

 Get off of me.    
 - [GROANS] Bitch! 
- [GUNSHOT]    
 What the hell is going on here?    
 You were supposed to escort her to intake.    
 We were just having a little fun.    
 RICHARDS: Oh, you were just having fun, huh?    
 You having fun now?    
 Is this fun? Hmm?    
 You must be Shauna Babcock.

 You okay?    
 It seemed like a good deal, but...    
 Why don't you just take a moment?    
 - Thank you for... 
- No. Don't thank me.    
 That never should have happened to you.    
 Clark Richards.    
 Still naming people Clark, huh?    
 I might be the last one.    
 - I was named after my grandfather.

 I'm pretty sure I'm named after a stripper my dad knew.    
 It smells good here in Colorado.    
 It's freezing, though.    
 You're from Las Vegas.    
 Yeah. I'm a desert rat.    
 Just a couple states over,    
 but it does not get cold like this.    
 You?    
 Just outside of Philly.    
 Gets freezing there, too.    
 Hey, Clark Richards, we're talking about the weather.    
 Yeah.    
 Obviously, we are amazing conversationalists.    
 Just tell me one thing, Clark Richards,    
 and don't lie to me because I'll know.    
 Whatever they're gonna do to me in there...    
 ...is it gonna hurt?    
 Not one bit.

This sweep abused her.     
 He banged on her cage, made lewd gestures,

 that this was revenge? 
Are you kidding me?

 There are new details emerging in the case of Brad Wolgast,     
 the former FBI agent wanted in the kidnapping     
 of a ten-year-old girl.     
 Wolgast was shot and killed Tuesday

 Why does that matter?     
 You wouldn't believe me if I told you.     
 Is there any history of sexual violence?     
 Anything like that?     
 Are you writing a book about her?     
 The stepfather. Ugly story.     
 - Was inadmissible. 
- How'd you get her to come here,     
 take the deal with Project Noah?     
 Everybody in that girl's life let her down.     
 I presented myself as someone who wouldn't.     
 You know what I'm starting to think?     
 Nobody gets over anything.     
 They say time helps, but it doesn't, does it?     
 It's... it's just another lie.     
 You and I have seen the worst     
 of what human beings do to each other.     
 You never cracked. You're losing it now.     
 Tell me why.     
 You're being dramatic.     
 Who's Fanning?     
 I know he's patient zero.     
 I know I didn't bring him here, and I know that he's     
 in people's dreams.     
 What the hell is going on here?     
 What did you put in that little girl's arm?     
 - This conversation is over. 
- No.     
 No, no, no, you answer me. Tell me what you did     
 - to those people that I brought here. 
- Just take him away.     
 - Who is Fanning? 
- Get him out of here.     
 What's gonna happen to Amy?     
 You've been avoiding me.     
 Uh, I'm-I'm busy.     
 I-I can't...     
 [SIGHS] What do you need from me?     
 - Oh, no, no. Wha-What? 
- Your dreams.     
 They're about Fanning.     
 Uh-huh.     
 Can you tell me when they started?     
 Around the time the second or third subject showed up.     
 [STAMMERS] They were just, like, wispy pictures at first.     
 So they changed is what you're saying.     
 Uh, yeah, they got more real, longer.     
 Movies I couldn't escape...     
 That I couldn't escape from.     
 Does Fanning ever talk to you in his dreams?     
 He does now.     
 That started after Babcock arrived.     
 - What does he say? 
- The last thing he told me     
 was, um...     
 "We have work to do."     
 Sierra.     
 - Sierra. Sierra, can I... 
- Excuse me.     
 My name is Lila Wolgast. I'm Brad Wolgast's ex-wife.     
 I-I-I left you, like, four messages.     
 You never called me back.     
 Which should have been your first clue     
 that I wasn't interested.     
 Brad's alive.     
 He was not shot and killed at the sheriff's station.     
 You have ten seconds.     
 In the last three years,  death row inmates     
 from    different prisons supposedly died unexpectedly     
 before their sentences could be carried out.     
 Do you have names?     
 They were sent to a government facility in Colorado     
 to be used as guinea pigs for top secret medical experiments.     
 You don't have anything resembling proof, do you?     
 An administrator from the Florence McClure     
 Women's Correctional Center can confirm     
 Shauna Babcock didn't die there.     
 She was taken by two federal agents.     
 My husband was one of them.     
 I'll look into this.     
 If it checks out, you'll hear from me.

 I guess now is a good time to talk.     
 All right. We have three minutes     
 before the surveillance system's back online.     
 Oh, my God.     
 I brought all these people here.     
 We thought we could cure all diseases,     
 create universal immunity,     
 exponentially increase life expectancy.     
 Doesn't look like it's going very well.     
 LEAR: We created a new species,

 are capable of.     
 We thought they were catatonic,

 This isn't science anymore.     
 This janitor, I guess,     
 Grey? He told me that Fanning was coming for Amy.     
 What does that mean?     
 I don't know.     
 Fanning's patient zero. We created these virals     
 from attenuated, genetically altered versions of his blood.     
 You keep saying "virals," but they drink blood,     
 burn to ash in the sun.     
 Why don't you just call them vampires?     
 'Cause we're scientists, Agent Wolgast,     
 and there's no such thing as vampires.     
 With each new subject turned,     
 I think he's gotten more powerful.     
 What does Fanning want?     
 What any prisoner wants, I would imagine.     
 To be free.
