 (Gasps) 
 We are the horns of the Increate. 
 We shall not fear the speaker of lies. 
 Argh! 
 We shall not be deceived. 
 We are one. We shall not... 
 (Heavy breathing) 
 (Screams) 
 (Low growling) 
 Why have I been forsaken? 
 You are the Monster of Italy. 
 Everyone is hunting for you. 
 Why? 
 They want to kill you. 
 But I... I... I... want... 
 (Gasping) 
 Argh! 
 (Wheezing breaths) 
 But I want to cure you.

 (Gasps) 
 (Gentle clatter in background) 
 (Chains rattle) 
 Have you lost your mind? 
 That's the first lucid thing you've said for hours. 
 Yet it is strangely comforting to know my old rival's still in there. 
 Somewhere. 
 Was I drugged? 
 Sedated. 
 You left me no choice. 
 You were poisoned, as was I, by the Labyrinth. 
 But I'm working on an antidote. 
 Release me immediately. 
 (Softly) No. I can't do that. 
 It's for your own safety. 
 And the safety of Florence. 
 I am no longer your enemy. 
 How many times must I prove it to you? 
 You are at one with the Labyrinth. 
 Leonardo... what are you speaking of? 
 I speak of your lies. 
 I speak of your Labyrinth. 
 Of... Of the... the damned Sons of Mithras. 
 I'm speaking of the Turks. 
 Of the so-called Pope Sixtus. 
 Of any and all who demand blind allegiance whilst at the same time claiming the name of God as license to destroy. 
 A God that I'm not even sure exists. 
 But if he does... he would be horrified at what's being perpetrated in his image. 
 (Bell tolling in distance) 
 I feel your loss, Signorina. 
 I know Captain Dragonetti was a wise and powerful ally of yours. 
 But the Turks will continue to spread terror unless we fight back. 
 We must be united. 
 Florence is honoring her obligation to host the festival. 
 But that is the extent of our commitment. 
 We live dangerous lives, in dangerous times. 
 To survive, you need allies. 
 Isolation will only ensure Florence's destruction. 
 You are in a position of power, Signorina. 
 I suggest you use it. 
 No amount of money or power can guarantee one's safety. 
 In fact, the more I have, the less safe I feel. 
 All I want is for Giulio to have a happy, peaceful life. 
 There can be no peace... while others endure such pain. 
 As a mother, your life is no longer your own. 
 It belongs to your child. 
 But you are also the new Mother of Florence. 
 Do not ignore your people. 
 Let us take the fight to the Turks... and drive them from our happy home. 
 (Grunts) Now, tell me... while I have you... do you believe in free will? 
 Playing God, are we now, Da Vinci? 
 Well, a lesser God, maybe. 
 But if I created something as diabolical as a human being... the last thing I'd do is give it the power to choose between good and evil. 
 Ah... 
 Now, that...is the genius of Our Lord. 
 Unlike the bird in the sky and the beast in the field, we must make a choice. 
 Saint or sinner. 
 Ah, so you are saying that we are capable of both great deeds... and terrible acts? 
 Mm-hm. 
 And you clearly believe I've made the darker choice. 
 Again, I ask... What do you accuse me of? 
 Well, my current theory is that you have become the physical manifestation of man's eternal inner struggle between good and evil. 
 You see, one part of you seeks piety. 
 The other's a killer. 
 (Laughs) 
 I'm the physical... 
 (Riario laughing) 
 Mm. And um... who do you claim I've killed? 
 Well, in Rome... 
 Cardinal Rodrigo. 
 And the poor bathhouse proprietor. 
 And Clarice Orsini. 
 And in Florence, Captain Dragonetti of the Officers of the Night. 
 I... I didn't. 
 You are the killer I described. 
 The pious man... who kills with regret... and then exhibits his victims as works of religious art. 
 (Breathes nervously) 
 (Riario whispers) Oh, my God. 
 Wh... 
 Why? 
 Why have I done this? 
 Uh... 
 For the glory of the Labyrinth, I suppose. 
 No, no, no. I... 
 I have never killed at their behest. 
 No, the Labyrinth seeks to make all men pious to be of one mind before God. 
 You see? 
 Faith... somehow... has made you a sinner. 
 The Architect said... resistance can take many forms. 
 When I... When I was under their influence... I made touch with an... another...another world, another reality... born of my resistance. 
 But yours... yours was different. 
 'Cause it caused you to act out... to kill. 
 I... 
 I... 
 I have doubted their instruction. 
 I have questioned their motives. I... 
 I've re... 
 I am not one. 
 I never was. 
 My heart... must be so black... my soul so riven with cruelty... I cannot be saved. 
 Well, you saved me. Didn't you? 
 After all we'd been through, I... I could not watch you die. 
 Well... 
 Then the Riario I know... is still in there. 
 There's still time. 
 I can heal you. 
 Body and soul. 
 We can eliminate the sinner. 
 (Gasps and growls) 
 (Deep voice) I will not be so easy to dispatch, you sick son of a whore. 
 I don't want to harm you. 
 I want to help you. 
 (Laughs) 
 Your help is to blame for all this. 
 You infected him with your enlightened ideas and introduced him to guilt, shame, remorse. 
 Riddled him with confusion. 
 I refuse to suffer his pathetic whimpering any longer. 
 I will crush this worm inside me, then wring the sacred life out of your damned throat, Leonardo Da Vinci. 
 (Snarls) 
 (Birdsong) 
 Yes... (Sobbing) I understand. 
 I promise. 
 Yes, I'll tell her. 
 Sophia? 
 Oh. I'm sorry. I woke you. 
 No, it's fine. 
 Who were you talking to? 
 I was talking to my mother. 
 I sound a bit mad, but... sometimes she appears to me. 
 Doesn't sound mad. 
 When did she...? 
 Oh, she's not dead. 
 She's... 
 I'm not entirely sure. 
 I... I can't actually see her. 
 She speaks to me, in my mind. 
 (Whispers) Here. 
 Come here. 
 Get some sleep. 
 You don't believe me. 
 I do believe you. 
 What does she say? 
 She had a message. 
 For you. 
 She said you must take me to him. 
 To Leonardo Da Vinci. 
 (Dramatic music) 
 The essence of poison arrow frog venom. 
 (Coughs) Oh, that's nasty stuff. 
 If I add that to the charcoal suspension, that should speed the process. 
 He admires you, you know. 
 The worm inside me. 
 He envies your conviction. 
 The, uh, the ease with which you make your choices. 
 But I see through you, Da Vinci. 
 I know your conviction is hollow. 
 Your passion hides your fear. 
 Your fear that you have already lost your struggle. 
 Shall I elaborate? 
 Please. 
 I think you'd appreciate a righteous kill, enjoy the sight of a gutted soul, still alive... heart beating... lungs inflating... and deflating. 
 Then, as the blood spills, the rhythm eases, death rattles... and for their last living act on earth, the sinners... they sh1t their pants. 
 (Wheezing laugh) 
 (Makes farting sound) 
 Even your beloved Clarice Orsini. 
 I released her... with the sweet cut of my blade. 
 (Swooshing) 
 That was lovely. 
 Sadly, you'll be gone soon enough. 
 The one, as you call him, will survive. 
 Uh-oh. I hear doubt in your voice. 
 You know I'm too strong to be erased by alchemy. 
 I will die when the worm does, in a pool of our own sh1t. 
 It's an aberration of the mind. 
 You know, you're nothing more. 
 You're a product of... some twisted chemistry. 
 Are you afraid of the truth, Da Vinci? 
 Am I too much... 
 No. 
 ..the dark mirror to your own war within? 
 I never fear the truth. Even from the mouth of liars. 
 Oh, well, let's get to the truth, then. 
 What did you learn from Otranto? 
 (Sighs) 
 I designed defensive weapons, to protect Florence. 
 Shh. 
 Truth, Da Vinci. 
 Leonardo... 
 Can I call you Leo? 
 Did you um... 
 Did you secretly relish the sight of your creations doing what you designed them for? 
 Killing. Slaughtering. Maiming. 
 A bombard has no morality, no motive. 
 It is simply a tool designed for a purpose. 
 My weapons were stolen. 
 Your designs, nevertheless. 
 Tell me, what... 
 What manner of man can dream up such... efficient devices of mass murder? 
 Remember, it was the worm who first recognized your genius for destruction. 
 Men like us... our inspiration comes not from heaven. 
 We do the Devil's work. 
 (Wheezing laughter) 
 We are hardly the same. 
 You said we were. 
 When? 
 You said you saw in my work the soul of an artist. 
 A kindred spirit, like you. 
 Only... 
 I... I am a mere apprentice. 
 I... I kill only the few. 
 You... You are the master, Da Vinci. 
 You kill the many. 
 You are the true Monster of Italy. 
 And I know what drew you to Otranto. 
 The hunt for Carlo de'Medici, the b*st*rd who slew your beloved mentor, Verrocchio, right here before your very eyes. 
 (Softly) I sought justice. 
 Oh... 
 (Rattling at door) 
 (Knocking) 
 What? 
 So you've heard, then? 
 Heard what? 
 Monster of Italy's come to Florence. 
 Everyone's locking their doors. 
 Yes. Yeah. 
 Hello. I thought we were going to Wallachia to find answers about the armor. 
 No. I don't need you today. 
 Is that your lover? 
 What? 
 Has he come for his morning knob slob? 
 (Slurps and laughs) 
 (Cackling) 
 Who the f*ck is that? 
 (Sighs) Oh... 
 (Laughing) 
 Oh, tell him. Tell him, Da Vinci. 
 Tell your mongrel bitch of my artistry. 
 Oh, then he can claim the bounty that is undoubtedly on my head, and have the wherewithal to... 
 (Laughing) 
 Tell him, Da Vinci. 
 Unlike you, I can face the truth. 
 Leo, what the hell are you doing? 
 Tell him, Artista. Tell them all. 
 (Grunts softly) 
 (Heavy breathing) 
 Riario's the Monster of Italy. 
 He killed Clarice and Dragonetti. 
 But it's not his fault. 
 He's ill. 
 I'm curing him. 
 (Shouting) 
 Kill him! 
 Kill the foreign scum! 
 Kill! Kill the Monster! 
 He killed our Captain! 
 It's chaos. 
 (Shouting continues outside) 
 You demanded the Captain's killer dead or alive. 
 What did you expect, Signorina? 
 I expected justice. 
 And you would have had it if not for your beloved Artista. 
 He let the killer escape his grasp. 
 Crusade festival is soon upon us. 
 Dignitaries from around Italy will not stay long in a city rife with turmoil. 
 It would be an embarrassment to Florence. One not soon forgotten. 
 I appreciate your concern for our reputation, Signora Cereta. 
 The Officers of the Night want revenge, not justice. 
 Their Captain was murdered and they won't stop until they find the killer. 
 And what do you suggest? 
 They need a new Captain. Let's give them one. 
 I suggest our new councilwoman nominates one of her associates. 
 If the Turks can get to Dragonetti, they can get to anyone. 
 You and Giulio must be protected. 
 My men can ensure your family and city that protection. 
 This treatment should, in time, revert him back to the old Riario. 
 I say we excise both of them. 
 (Gasping) 
 (Softly) I had...terrifying nightmares. 
 But waking up to face this reality is... is far, far worse. 
 How could I do such terrible things? 
 You really don't remember. 
 No. 
 But when Leonardo told me, I... I knew in my heart he was correct. 
 Sorry, I'm struggling. When he... When he told you you were a monster... who wasn't a monster, because you didn't know you were a monster... 
 Zo, he's... He's not responsible. 
 It was a consequence of the Labyrinth conditioning. 
 His mind couldn't handle it. It broke in two. 
 I think because he was already compromised. 
 Compromised? W... 
 When you were in the New World, you spoke of your first kill. 
 Your mother. 
 'Strangled at your own hand, orchestrated by your father.' 
 Perhaps you rejected the Labyrinth's conditioning because your psyche was already fractured. 
 Then there is no hope for me. 
 Your cure will not work. 
 No, I can... I can flush the toxins. 
 I can heal your body, but I just... 
 (Sighs) 
 Well, we may need to find another solution for the mind. 
 To release you from this internal struggle. 
 To wake you up. 
 As I had to... in my alternate reality. 
 Mm-hm. 
 That's great, uh, fascinating, really. 
 May I remind you that everyone in Florence is hunting this man right now. 
 Listen, they want him dead. 
 Well, we can't let that happen. 
 I need him. The... 
 Crusade needs him. 
 We don't have much time. 
 His Holiness is coming to Florence. 
 Pope Sixtus? 
 In Florence? 
 To secure the allegiance of the city states. 
 To launch his Crusade. 
 When? 
 For the Pageant of Arms. 
 To see the demonstration of your weapon. 
 When His Holiness learns that the Vatican killer is here in Florence... 
 He will retreat and his Crusade will fall apart and the Turks will overrun Italy. 
 (Chains rattling) 
 You know what you must do? 
 Tell the truth. Deliver me to the Council... And collect the bounty. Sounds like a good plan to me. 
 No. Riario is the face of the Crusade. It would never survive the revelation. 
 Please, Leonardo. Let me pay for my sins. 
 Let my death serve Italy. 
 No. No, that won't be necessary. 
 I have a plan. 
 But...we will need help. 
 Help? 
 We can't give them Riario. 
 But we can deliver a monster to the people of Florence. 
 And Nico's gonna catch him. 
 
 
 
 (Fire crackling) 
 Hey, little one. It's okay. 
 What's happening? 
 My men have cornered the killer outside the palace. 
 And your little prince is leading the charge. 
 Nico? 
 (Shouting outside) 
 (Shouting continues) 
 There he is! 
 (Shouting in background) 
 (Grunts) 
 (Groans) 
 (Groaning) 
 (Body thuds) 
 (Panting) 
 Ah. Oh, sh1t, that was close. 
 (Cheering and applause) 
 (Rattling) 
 (Water running nearby) 
 (Clang) 
 How long was I asleep? 
 The day has come and gone. 
 Night has fallen? 
 He's coming. 
 No. Wait. 
 Listen to me. Look at me. 
 Look at me. Look at me. 
 (Whimpers) 
 I need you to listen to me for a minute. 
 What you told me last night that your mother said, the message, I know him. 
 What? 
 Da Vinci. I know him. 
 I'm not sure what it means, but... but... 
 I think the person that Lupo's looking for... 
 I think it might be you. 
 (Thudding above) 
 He's going to take you. But I swear to God I won't let him hurt you. 
 I swear. 
 (Barking) 
 You've got to trust me. Can you do that? 
 I have a way of getting us out of here. I have a plan. I have a plan. 
 (Rattling) 
 You know how this works. 
 Not you. 
 (Barking) 
 (Whimpering) 
 (Barking) 
 (Clunk) 
 (Whispering) 
 Tell me this is your good side. 
 Good. 
 Oh, the serum appears to be holding. 
 You are due another dose. 
 What I still fail to grasp is my true motive. 
 Cardinal Rodrigo was a man of the cloth. 
 I had no quarrel with him. 
 Well, perhaps you did. 
 When you returned to the Vatican, you found Cardinal Rodrigo in place at the Pope's right hand. 
 I confess I... 
 I felt somewhat threatened by their alliance. Yes. 
 Clarice was hunting Carlo. 
 That was a threat to your new-found faith. 
 And Captain Dragonetti was vehemently against your Crusade. 
 Your saint was threatened, retreated into a nightmare world, and let your sinner reign free. 
 (Dramatic music) 
 Are you ready? 
 Mm. 
 (Exhales) 
 (Rattling) 
 (Chains rattling) 
 I have no desire to hurt you. 
 He, on the other hand... 
 (Dog growls) 
 The Page... showed me your convent. 
 It showed me you. 
 (Sobbing) 
 (Whispers) I cannot decipher it. 
 I'm certain that one of you can. 
 And you're the only one left. 
 (Lupo sighs) 
 Tell me...its secrets... and no harm will come to you. 
 (Eerie music) 
 If I'd known, I'd never have agreed to host the presentation. 
 That's exactly why we were kept in the dark. 
 (Thud as doors open) 
 (Clears his throat) 
 Your Holiness. May I introduce... 
 Signorina Moschella. 
 I expected Count Riario among my welcomers. 
 He sent word. Did you not receive it? 
 He's back in Rome, gathering troops for the Condottieri Legion. 
 A legion which still does not include Florentines. 
 It's a pity how shortsighted a city can be after so recently suffering excommunication... cut off from the rest of the country... no assurance of safety. 
 Well, try as you might to threaten us, I assure you there is nothing Rome can provide that we cannot provide ourselves. 
 Mm. 
 (Clears his throat) 
 I hear your men captured a brutal killer today. 
 Yes, we... 
 One man... captured with great difficulty. 
 Imagine... when a horde of thousands of these same ungodly heathens attack... all at once. 
 The Holy fist of a unified Italy will crush our enemies. 
 But if you do not join us, there would be no protection. 
 My dear... would you rather your son grew up to be ruler amongst the dead... or amongst the living? 
 Tell me what it says. 
 I don't know. 
 I'm sorry. 
 (Gasps) Wait! 
 Tell me what it says! 
 Wait. 
 (Eerie music) 
 Wait. 
 I think... 
 What? 
 (Growls and barks) 
 If you run... he will find you. 
 (Barking) 
 (She whimpers) 
 (Barking) 
 (Barking) 
 (Barking) 
 Why did you have to come here, Lucrezia Donati? 
 (Lucrezia whispers) Lupo. 
 (He groans) 
 (Dog growling) 
 (Sophia gasps) 
 Is he...? 
 You're safe now. 
 Right. We're setting up overlooking the Arno, so I need you to unfurl the sketches and just hang them... 
 Careful! Careful. Careful. 
 Just... 
 We... We will give you quite the spectacle tonight, Signora. 
 I think you will be very pleased. 
 All the spectacle in the world is moot... if the Crusade lacks leadership. 
 I'm at my wits' end. Where could Count Riario be? 
 I fear the worst. 
 The monster has been vanquished, so... the Count's in no danger. 
 Every time an Officer appears, I expect to hear they've found Girolamo's body crucified. 
 Oh. 
 Riario is a warrior at heart. 
 It would take more than an Ottoman assassin to stop him. 
 Would you excuse me? 
 Of course. 
 No, no! What are you doing? That's upside down! 
 (Fireworks exploding) 
 [MAN] Open up! Come on! 
 sh1t! 
 Oi! 
 Open up in there! 
 On the orders of the Doge of Venice, we are looking for Count Riario. 
 Shh. 
 (Knocking and shouting) 
 Open up! 
 Get up! Open the door now! 
 Quiet. 
 Open the door! 
 Don't... he ...  about it. 
 (Screams) 
 Up here! Follow me! 
 Help! 
 They're gonna murder me! 
 Wait, wait, wait, wait! (Groaning) 
 Release me from this bondage. 
 Don't. 
 (Rattling) 
 Argh! 
 (Grunting) 
 (Groaning) 
 (Yells) 
 (Groaning) 
 Oh, f... 
 Ah... Oh! 
 Jesus! 
 Oh, f*ck. 
 (Fireworks exploding) 
 Gentlemen, this is a cannon I will be demonstrating at tonight's Pageant of Arms. 
 Now, this is just a prototype. 
 The model we take into battle will be of a still larger caliber. 
 What lies in this chamber? 
 It's an acidic substance. It's designed to weaken the Ottoman armor. 
 On impact, the second chamber explodes, penetrating further into the metal. 
 It will leave only shrapnel and vanquished enemies in its wake. 
 The wrath of God in a single, neat package. 
 Indeed. 
 We've heard of hellish Turkish weapons. 
 Exotic devices that spit fire and are invincible. 
 Girolamo! 
 Yet you claim this weapon will thwart them? 
 Da Vinci! 
 (Riario mutters) 
 Look who has been returned to us by the Grace of God. 
 Yes. Uh... 
 Where has the Count been? 
 Oh, as I was telling the Signora, I was gravely ill, being tended to by a dear friend. 
 I appear to have missed all the fun. 
 It seems to have affected his eyes. 
 Perhaps Da Vinci has encountered such a phenomenon before. 
 Yes. Come... 
 Come back with me to my studio. 
 I may have a salve or a solution that can help ease your pain. 
 And miss your triumph, Da Vinci? (Tuts) 
 (Da Vinci sighs) Oh, thank God. 
 I feared the worst. 
 What happened? 
 He's left your studio in quite a mess. 
 Let's put it this way. There's a lot of blood. 
 Oh, he can't do much damage here, not with all these people around. 
 No, I wouldn't be so sure. 
 The monster is acting out on anyone who threatens Riario. 
 Vanessa... 
 Look, take her somewhere safe. 
 Just keep her close. 
 And keep a sword closer. 
 Signor Da Vinci, your demonstration. 
 Show time. 
 (Chatter) 
 The army of the Ottoman Empire is the greatest and most powerful this world has ever seen. 
 Their engineering is far advanced and their weapons are second to none. 
 Until...now. 
 Load the warhead! 
 Stand back. 
 Please. Ladies and gentlemen, stand back. Please. 
 Clear the way. 
 Stand back, please. 
 Loaded. 
 Shame it doesn't really work. 
 No, it's all about the show. 
 In the distance, an Ottoman warship approaches. 
 Light the fuse! 
 (Fuse fizzing) 
 (Suspenseful music) 
 (Booming explosion) 
 (Cheering and applause) 
 (Muffled voice) Leo. Leo. 
 Leo. 
 Hey. I can't see him. 
 Riario's gone. 
 (Chatter) 
 Oh... 
 Take the south. I'll head north. 
 (Da Vinci mutters) 
 Come on. 
 Riario! 
 Ah. 
 The fellow artist. 
 Come to critique my work. 
 (She whimpers) 
 Oh, no, no, no, no! 
 Wait, wait. Wait. Look. 
 (Blade scraping) 
 I've come to tell you the truth. 
 (She whimpers) 
 I am like you. 
 I, too, struggle with myself more than any enemy. 
 Let me tell you of Otranto. 
 (Laura choking) 
 As I walked through the carnage... through the smoke, the... blood and death... for one ugly... dark moment... I reveled. 
 In awe... of my machines of death. 
 The glorious bloodshed that my creations had wrought. 
 (Whispers) I hate that part of myself...so much. 
 I sometimes wish that I could open up my veins... and drain the evil from myself. 
 A very sad state. 
 Yet, not like me at all. 
 I wish only to express myself through my chosen medium. 
 No, no, no, Riario. Don't, don't, don't, don't. 
 (Ripping) 
 (She gasps) 
 Now... let me open her up for you. 
 Show you her beating heart. 
 No, no, no. That's not why you want her to bleed, is it? 
 She's tempting you. 
 Isn't she? Her obvious affections, they're stirring up feelings inside you. 
 Feelings you have forbade yourself to feel. 
 She loves you... as your own mother did. 
 (Gasps) 
 That's a love...you cannot allow yourself to return. 
 And that's why she must die. 
 Because she reminds you of the origins of your broken soul. 
 Of what started it all. 
 But you are too much of a coward to face it, so go on, finish it. 
 Finish it. Close the circle. 
 But don't use a blade. Use your hands. 
 Strangle the life out of her, like you did your own flesh and blood. 
 Or... you can choose. 
 There's free will, Girolamo. 
 You can choose to hide in your nightmares... as I did... or you can choose to wake up. 
 Wake up. 
 It is the only way to defeat the sinner. 
 Wake up. 
 Wake up. 
 (She gasps) 
 (Weapon scrapes on floor) 
 Lucrezia? 
 Yes. 
 Oh, we should get going. It's a two-day ride to Florence. 
 What's in Florence? 
 Leonardo Da Vinci. 
 (Horse neighing) 
 (Hoofbeats) 
 Go! Get in the house! 
 Do you know them? Who are they? 
 Okay, listen. I don't have much time to explain but I need you to be brave. 
 Why? Why? 
 Here. 
 Take this...and hide. 
 Look at me. Look at me. 
 Pick your moment and run. 
 Bring this to Florence. 
 I swear to you, Leo will be there and he will help you. 
 Okay. 
 Go. Go. 
 Out. 
 Now. 
 (He spits) 
 (Horses whinnying) 
 Not surprised to see me? 
 "The daughter will find the Page." 
 Our soothsayer rarely misses the mark. 
 Well, she did this time. 
 Find it. 
 Start here. 
 Where is Lupo Mercuri? 
 He's here. All the parts of him that his vile dog couldn't stomach. 
 I know you came for the Page. 
 I can only assume you intend to use it against me. 
 Look everywhere. 
 You're right. I would have. 
 But the Page isn't here. 
 It drove Lupo insane and he destroyed it in front of my eyes. 
 (Suspenseful music) 
 Nothing.We will fin. 
 With or without your help. 
 (Instrumental music)
