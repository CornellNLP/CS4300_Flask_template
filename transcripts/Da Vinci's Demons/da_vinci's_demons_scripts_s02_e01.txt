 Fate has chosen you, Leonardo. 
 I will follow you to the ends of the earth to retrieve what's mine. 
 You have to make a decision. 
 The Book Of Leaves or whoever tears you away, not both. 
 The Book contains secrets of the Divine. 
 Whoever lays their hands on the Book Of Leaves will rule the world. 
 Here is the secret to deciphering them. 
 I believe there may be a spy in my court. 
 Lucrezia Donati has Da Vinci tied up between her thighs. 
 You are Lucrezia Donati's father? 
 The Pazzis are moving on Florence. 
 They want to kill Lorenzo. You shared secrets with Riario and put the entire city at peril! This is your work! They're weak, Your Holiness. This is your chance to strike. The Pazzi conspire against us. They're in league with Rome! Death to the Medicis! Your true loyalty is to the Medicis, Captain. I suggest you leave this one to me. I'm bearing your child, your son, Giuliano. Help your family. Rome is my family! Da Vinci! I wonder which of the two men you f*ck will be buried alongside you! I know this ring. If we survive this, I'll kill you both! ♪ DaVinci's Demons 2x01 ♪ 
The Blood of Man 
Original Air Date on March 22, 2014 ♪ Riario : Did you ever think we'd see the end together? I never believed that I would be facing an end at all. God is laughing at us, Da Vinci. This is not our fate. (Drumming outside) (Screaming) (Water running) Riario : One way or another, this is every man's fate. (Crowd chanting) Our lives are made by the deaths of others. You were very quick to surrender. After all we've seen...  lost, perhaps you're naive to endure. There is a greater story here, still being written. By whom? (Drumming continues) (Door opens) (Chanting in Quechua) (Chanting) Well... we both wanted to see what's next. There's still time. (Drumming and chanting stops) (Chanting resumes) (Speaks Quechuan) God's vengeance is upon you! It's over, Lorenzo! Da Vinci! The House of Medici falls today! The windows are all intact. Where are they? Beneath us. (Grunting) (Groans) You betrayed me, Da Vinci. I will see you dead for it. If we escape, I promise you every opportunity to settle the score. But for now, Your Magnificence, please just shut the f*ck up! Station men at every gate. Have reinforcements in the trees, here and here. Stand ready to march on my signal and no one else's. Understood? Gentlemen, I give you Florence - a jewel beyond price, which will be ours before nightfall. (Cheering) We're wasting time, we should summon Duke Frederico's army now. Florence is ours for the taking! And I say it is not. If Lorenzo is still alive, he might yet rally his people. Lorenzo's dead, or bleeding to death in the sewers. I cut his throat myself. Until he's proven dead, we have nothing. The people need to see a corpse. Captain Grunwald, ride to Duke Frederico and make sure that hulking cyclops sticks to the plan. He cannot invade before our signal. Take her with you and I will bring Da Vinci! Give me a lantern. Follow me, you fools! (Groaning) (Cries out) Da Vinci! There's smoke rising from the Duomo. Has all of Florence gone insane? We should go back. No. I say we go on. Leo was desperate to board the Basilisk. If we take this barge to Pisa, we can stall it there. What about the Maestro? He'll meet us before she sails. You sure? f*ck, no! But delaying the Basilisk is all we can manage. Let's find that dog's breath who'll take us to Pisa. People are fleeing the city in fear. Clarice and her brood scurry for home, time to close the fist. I'll lead the mob against the Medici palace. Find Giustini and hunt down any Medici loyalists. Move! I need a defensive line for the palace gate. The barriers must be higher. We need more men. We have none. Find some f*cking men! They should be back by now. We have to go back for my husband. Quattrone will look after him. See what happens to friends of Medici! Medici! Gut the captain and the Medici bitches! Go to the palace! Come with me. I'll deal with this! (Crowd shouting above) Death to the Medici! Hurry! Quickly, follow me. Girls, stay with me. Florence is no place for the godless! Stay with me. Girls, stay with me. Death to the Medici whore! Where's Maddalena? Maria, where's Maddalena? Maddalena? (Sobs) Maddalena! Mother? Mother? Aargh! Open the door! Please, let me through! Mother! (Screams) Please! (Sobs) (Horse whinnies) Open the door! Hold the doors! They must not pass! Come along, girls, follow me. There you are. Take the children to Lorenzo's quarters. You will allow no one in to see them save myself. Maria, I need you to be strong for your sisters, do you understand? Your father will be home soon. Now go. Gualberto, see to it. This way. Fabrizio? Follow me. Stay close to the children. If the palazzo is breached, I trust you to do the right thing. Mix it with honey. A teaspoon apiece should be sufficient. My lady, I cannot. Do you know what will happen to them if the Pazzis enter these walls? Can I trust you or not? Of course. Fall back inside the gates! Listen to my orders! Get back! Da Vinci? You're finished! (Groans and cries out) Come on. Come on! (Groans in agony) Just leave me here to die, Da Vinci. And leave me to fix Florence on my own? Now that I've glimpsed the gears that lie beneath the face... What? You didn't just use Lucrezia to get close to me. (Coughs) You manipulated us all. Riario : Da Vinci? Da Vinci! Come on! Well? Nothing. Stand still. They were here. He's dragging a body. Maybe you truly did kill Lorenzo. That's it. (Groans) (Cries out) By God's blood, I can't go on. There might be a way out of this. I just need you to play dead. I am dead. Signor Da Vinci? You took your time scurrying back here. Forgive me, I had my own family... Where's Lorenzo? No one knows. Assemble every man we have. Lorenzo must be found. With respect, surely Lorenzo would never leave his property, his children, undefended? What do you suggest? There he is. I told you I'd killed him. The artista has abandoned his corpse. I'll prepare to signal Duke Frederico. Do it. I'll finish the job and decapitate him. It seems finishing the job has fallen to me. You really must surrender now. The Medicis are finished. You must not throw your life away for Lorenzo. If Rome takes Florence... you'll understand. I have nothing to lose. Well, either way, you'll have one blast to kill us all. Aim well. Oh, I will. 50 florins to the man who takes him. 100 florins! (Gasps) Your vendetta against Da Vinci blinds you. Forget him. We must move on the Palazzo Medici. Gather your men, then, Francesco. I will speak to Duke Frederico. How many weapons do we have? Backswords and boar spears, boiling oil... It's not weapons, it's men that we lack. Still no sign of Quattrone. I just hope he's with Lorenzo. Arm the maids, the servants, anyone who can carry a weapon. Enzo says you're a tolerable shot. Take the longbows and position yourselves in the windows above the gates. Go! Once the oil is boiling, ready another cauldron. Capitano, a word. Outside the Duomo, Riario said your true loyalty was to us, implying that it had once been otherwise. Did you know of this attack? My husband would have had you killed just for that hesitation. My allegiance wavered, signora. When it did, Rome sought to buy it. But now I fear that Rome itself has strayed. I have news for you, Captain. The Eternal City strayed some time ago. I am in your debt for the life of my child. But if you betray the Medici family again, I will have you gutted like a pig. Who else was involved? The Pazzis, Bernardo Baroncelli, Giustini, Battista, Fathers Matthei and Bagnone... My brother? Cardinal Orsini was the one who first approached me. Then the moment the palazzo is secure and my husband is safe, I want you to seek out the Cardinal, understood? Securing his safety would be prudent. f*ck prudence! I want my brother rotting in the Bargello by nightfall. Look at us! Blood on our vestments! The carnage we permitted in the House of the Lord! Heavenly Father, I know we have fallen short of your glory. Our sins are ever before you. Wash me from iniquity. Create in me a clean... Take hold of yourself! The people need a cardinal's voice, not a coward's! My sister Clarice survived your knives! She knows of my complicity now! Liberty! Liberty! Liberty! Liberty! Liberty! Death to them! Uncle! Uncle! Let the maggots burn! Aaargh! (Grunting) Aaargh! Leo! I could have killed you. I... I... [ laughter ] My dear Count. Your charming agent was just regaling us with details of your folly. So Lorenzo still lives? Finally ready to put an end to this madness and send my men to take the city. The uprising has to appear to have been motivated from within, so we allowed the Pazzi family to take the lead. You will stick to the plan and wait for our signal. It doesn't take two eyes to see what a dog's breakfast you've made of this affair. According to Signora Donati, the problem is you're more preoccupied with finding Da Vinci than securing Florence. Da Vinci stole something of incalculable value which the Holy Father has entrusted me with retrieving. More valuable than Florence? A key... One of two. which will unlock a treasure worth 1,000 cities. Da Vinci has them both now. And I believe some knowledge I desire. Excuse me. Aagh! Where is the Vault of Heaven? I've got no idea, he didn't say. No, but he... he did reveal something, didn't he? I can see it in your eyes, an indication of where he's heading. Give her to me. It'll be a pleasure to make her talk. No, no, that won't be necessary. Signora Donati knows very well what I'm capable of. Perhaps you'd like to honor your new friend with a small gift of a personal nature. An eye for an eye, so to speak. Wait, wait! For what? He's headed to Pisa. He's boarding a ship. What's the name of the ship? Tell me the name of the ship. What was the name of the f*cking ship? The name of the ship? The Basilisk. The Basilisk? We ride for Pisa immediately. You will come with us. If you are lying, I will make your father pay in blood. Mercuri : Your Grace? Are you sure Pisa takes precedence right now? Da Vinci has the keys, Lupo. If he reaches the Vault of Heaven, the Book Of Leaves is his to claim. I want to know its secrets as much as you do. But the Holy Father was clear - secure Florence first. Gather your men, Captain. We're leaving. The Holy Father fills our coffers, not you. Florence must come first. Lupo? I'm sorry. I tell you what. If you want to chase phantoms and leave the fortunes of Florence to us, go. I'll even give you some trusted men to accompany you. And provisions for the journey. Why would you possibly do that? 'Cause I don't like you. And I'm quite happy to see you sail off the edge of the world. But if you somehow achieve your aims and return, well, you'll owe me, won't you? Very well. I accept your offer. Of course you do! (Distant shouting) You, Leonardo, must book a passage on that ship. The Book Of Leaves of your mother's faith... ..will remain a mystery. The choice and the consequences... are yours. Leo, you've been dreaming. (gasps) What's going on? The city's in chaos. There are rumors the Pazzis carry the day. Where's Lorenzo? He's downstairs. How is he? He's dying. I applied a poultice of staunchweed and yarrow to stop the bleeding but it hasn't helped. His wounds are far too great for us to treat. And if he dies here, Leo, the responsibility is ours. We need to convey His Magnificence to the palace. Let his own physic attend his final hours. There's no point. He's lost too much blood, he won't survive the journey. What do you propose? To be logical. Lorenzo's lost blood. He needs blood. I'm gonna give him some of mine. Leo, you can't, the Bible prohibits it! Leviticus is explicit. You are not to eat any blood, either of bird or animal! Damn your superstitions, Andrea! We're not gonna make him drink it! There's a folio in my loft, top shelf, west wall. Beneath the boar's skull. Red cover, embossed with an Islamic star. Ibn-al-Nafis. What? Arab physician and scholar, practiced in the 13th century. He disproved Galen's assertion that blood moves through invisible pores and argued that it travels from the heart to the lungs through the veins and arteries, just as the canals of Venice bring provisions to the city. But they're running dry. So we need to replenish them. I am gonna cut into my arm, and transfer the blood from my body into his. Here - Sharh Tashrih al Qanoun. 'Commentary on the Anatomy of a Canon...' You see? Nafis made the same discoveries I have. All those nights dissecting corpses, Andrea. They're about to pay off. We searched his pockets. 
 
 Commander! Where is he? My lady? My husband. Has he not returned? He was with you. We were separated during the attack. Lorenzo was wounded but managed to escape. Escape where? When last I saw him, he fled with the help of the artista Da Vinci. Then he's alive? Why are you here, Commander? My men are exhausted, trapped for hours by the mob. And Lorenzo is out among them. Mount a search at once. We barely survived our arrival. Your duty is his safety. My lady, you are not empowered to give me orders. As a member of the Signoria, the city... The city? Florence was nothing before the Medicis. Now it is the jewel of Europe. This city owes everything to Lorenzo. Now go and find him, or I will have your titles and your testicles removed. Lift. (Grunting) Hold him still. Aargh! Hold him still, do it! You coward! You cowards, I'll kill you all! I'll kill you all, you cowards! (Grunting) Tincture of opium. It should keep him sedated. Everyone wash your hands. Why? The Eastern scholars believed ablution prevented contamination as their faith. Now who's superstitious? Just do it, Andrea! Grab me those clamps. What on earth is that? Sheep's intestine. The Greeks used reeds for cannulas, we use my pen nibs. There are other Medicis to replace Lorenzo. But Florence only has one Leonardo Da Vinci. Look what Florence has become without Lorenzo. Come on! I was wrong. He believed in me when no one else would, he entrusted me with the city's defense. That's what I'm doing now. Finish that. I'm defending Florence. I believe I can save him, Andrea. I need you to believe it too. Pass me that knife. One, two, three... Argh! Now, open the median basilic on Lorenzo's arm. It's anterior to the elbow, just below the surface. (Grunts) What have I done? Clamp the intestines, Vanessa. What? Clamp the intestine! Now, insert the other end of the pen nib into Lorenzo's vein. Into the vein. Yes. Now release the clamp. Is it working? Is the tube moving? No. Raise me up. Stop. How long do we let it run its course? Till Lorenzo regains his color and I lose mine. It's moving. (Slurred) Our blood is being transferred. Leo... It's alright. It's alright, Andrea. Time is a river, and the Turk has walked upstream. He assured me fate isn't done with me yet. (Moans softly) There you are. I feared I'd lost you. Where am I? You're where you belong, by my side. I pushed you away. I should never have done that. I'm sorry. Why do you condemn yourself to walk this path alone? I'm not alone. And my friends are more loyal than most. They admire your mind. But who among them truly knows you? Tell me this feels anything less than perfect. (Deep rumbling) What was that? This is how it happens. This is how you leave us. What do they want? They want what we all want, Leonardo. They want you. This painting. It was my first glimpse of Lorenzo. Viewed only after our families had brokered our marriage. I pray it's not the last sight I have of him as well. I have become aware of Lorenzo's current circumstance. It seems our hopes hang on your first born. You can imagine how much that thrills me. Signora, I would like to move you and the children to a different part of the city. We have repelled the Pazzis, but without Lorenzo, they will return. Gualberto. This man has brought a message from Lorenzo. Is he safe? Agh! (Muffled cry) (Clarice panting) I'm only trying to save Florence. So am I. Urgh! Signora, you must leave tonight. The Medicis do not run, Signor Da Vinci. We will fight until our last breath. He still breathes. Faint...but still there. Damn you, Leo. There are limits even for you. Maestro? Do you think Lorenzo will recover? Truthfully? I have no idea, this is all beyond me. What do you think will happen if he, if he dies here with us? You mean if it's discovered that we, and not the Pazzi, succeeded in killing the ruler of Florence? I hesitate to hazard a guess. Would they hang a woman who's with child? My dear... Vanessa, shh. (Sobs) Worse, what if the Pazzis discover my condition? They'll hang me in the piazza as a traitor! No, Vanessa... They'll kill both of us. No, no one is going to harm you or your child. Let us agree right now, the truth of his parentage remains a secret. (Splutters) Are you alright? (Panting) Andrea... What? I'm seeing things. (Sheep bleats) Something's happening to me, Andrea. I think my soul... has be-- become unmoored. That's because you're drifting towards death. (Rasping breaths) That's enough. I'm putting a stop to this. No, no, please! Please, please. Not... Not until... Lorenzo's recov-- I'm sorry, my boy. But there's already been too much death this day. My lord? You are leaving Italy? If I can commandeer the Basilisk in time, then, yes. I am here to take care of your needs. Take me with you. I plan to sail an ocean, Zita, to an unknown land. I may be forced to do terrible things. I have done terrible things. I don't care. Your place is in Rome. I serve you, my lord. The Holy Father will simply use me, hurt me. Then I free you from servitude. Speak to the quartermaster, he will provide you with a horse. You can ride away from all this. I am far from home, my lord. In these lands, a woman of my color alone, You killing me now would be more merciful than freedom. Then-- ready another horse and follow. Believe it or not, I find it less unnerving for you to just interrupt me, than for you to ling like a vomitus stench. I come from Florence, Your Holiness. With good news, I pray? Giuliano di Medici is dead. And his brother? Wounded. I would have sent dogs if I wanted him wounded. The Pazzis strive to end the matter swiftly. And yet you are here, not by my nephew's side. Your nephew, Count Riario is-- he's no longer in Florence. As we speak, he's embarking on a journey across the sea, to pursue some mysterious book. The Book Of Leaves. Yet another soul falls prey. Let's go, you laggards. We haven't got all day. Oi, you two! The Captain's in aft cabin. Think we'll convince him to wait for the Maestro? I once convinced a woman I was the ghost of her late husband, back from the dead to help her conceive. Watch and learn. Captain De Noli, my employer, Leonardo Da Vinci, Lorenzo Medici's war engineer, has sent me to humbly request you delay your voyage a few short hours. It could be less. With artists it's hard to know, but I'll reimburse you for your time. And all you have to do is sit there. That is perfect. Like a mute. Alas... I've already made my own agreements with the Captain. Well, I must say, it is good to see you both. Our last encounter left me so-- empty-handed. Now, let's see what gifts you've brought me, while the Captain fetches my own little trinket from the hold. The undiscovered land that hides the Vault. Remarkable. Truly. Now, this skin is the Abyssinian's, is it not? The codes which complete the map, presumably. I wonder...did Da Vinci kill Solomon Ogbai himself to claim it? Yes? No? Nothing? An astrolabe. Unlike any I have seen before. A device to tame the stars. What of the keys to the Vault? Still in the Maestro's possession, you b*st*rd. I shall have to improvise. Nevertheless, I thank you. The keys remain useless without these tools to guide the way. And I thank you as well, dear cousin, once again. Your duplicitous ways have borne fruit. Leonardo will come for you. But um... tragically... not for you. Chain her and the mongrel. Ready them to face God's judgment. What about me? Worry not, Nico. I have faith you will prove your usefulness to me in time. (Mutters) (Door opens) Two visits in a week, brother. I must be blessed to receive such a holy honor. Perhaps I simply lack satisfactory entertainment. Or perhaps your plans for Florence, have fallen short of their aims. How could you possibly know this? Your guards? I shall remove their tongues. Your face is mine, Alessandro. I know its every contour, what causes it to smile, to grimace. It reveals all. You should have foreseen this. Any endeavor to win the hearts of Christians by force will never be blessed with God's favor. You dare instruct me on God's wishes? Hubris, given your current situation. Then it is a sin we both share. For pride created this dilemma you now face. If the Medicis remain in power, all of Florence will turn from Rome. Your only course is to quarantine the city. (Chuckles) Do you seriously expect me to accept your counsel? You are here, are you not? I'm drawn to recall that day from our youth. When you held me beneath the icy waters of the Orba. Sadly, the Lord had other plans. I've always believed that your inability to take my life stemmed from cowardice. But perhaps, you wish to utilize the wisdom I have to offer. Huh? So, what do you suggest, Francesco? Seek out a champion. And put him to the cause. If Girolamo's no longer capable then, perhaps-- King Ferrante of Naples  will serve you better. I've always found Ferrante's commitment wonderfully, fanatical. Do you doubt the logic of my proposal? No, no, no. No. It's your motives I have a difficult time trusting. You must know by now, that despite all that has transpired between us, I will always serve the best interests of Rome. Riario : Through my holy anointing, may the Lord bless you and pardon you, whatever sins you have committed. Please, don't do this. We'll tell you what you want, do what you need. They have nothing to offer. Say farewell. I demand the right to my last words. Nico... the first time this snake lets down his guard, sink a dagger and slice him from balls to brains. A touching sentiment. And I would be profoundly curious to see him try. And what of you, cousin? Silent, when there is no one to seduce. I do not say farewell without regret, Lucrezia. For what it's worth, though, I would have spared Amelia, if I could. Don't you dare speak her name. Don't you dare! May God have mercy on both our souls. I regret never having f*cked you. (Liquid bubbling) You have failed us, Da Vinci. You are not the one we hoped. It is a dark hour. And your arrogant belief you are capable of anything has only made it darker. I couldn't abandon Lorenzo. So you abandon your destiny! You have allowed your sympathy for others to blind you to the greater struggle. And in so doing, you may have lost everything. I told you there would be consequences. You cannot even grasp what your actions have wrought! Because of you, the Book Of Leaves will be lost forever. Or worse, recovered by our enemies. The Vatican? I speak of agents far more ancient than the Church of St Peter. The blood of man is on your hands now. The servants of the horned god will seize their opportunity. Al-Rahim, wait! Wait! Al-Rahim! Al-Rahim is no longer here. (Chokes) Leo? (Rasping breath) Andrea? Andrea! Who are you? We are the horns of the Increate. We are the shadow at the Center of the Labyrinth. (Screams) What on earth is going on? Stay back! And you will pay for the sins of Daedalus. I promised revenge if we escaped, Da Vinci. And now it's time for me to fulfill my side of the bargain! (Cries out) On the next all new  Da Vinci's Demons. This Book of Leaves you seek, Do you really believe it could help Florence? I believe it could save it. Death to the Medicis! You have to tell the people that you haven't abandoned them. Lorenzo's regime must be eroded. Seize Florence. Rome's aggression will not stop. We will apply unrelenting pressure. It's time to save our city. Da Vinci's Demons,  all new episodes Saturday at 9pm. ♪
