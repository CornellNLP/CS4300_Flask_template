 (clamoring) 
 Hey, Becky. 
 Hey, Anika. 
 And Becky. 
 Hey, these are for today. 
 Thanks. 
 Okay, the designs for the jacket line need approval by noon, 
 and The Tonight Show wants you to sing for... 
 Pass. Okay. 
 Uh, the president wants... 
 Excuse you. 
 I'm back here. 
 Today is not the day, Becky. 
 Hear me? 
 Everything go okay at the doctor? 
 Yeah, good. Come on. 
 Okay. Well, the president is asking that you'll attend the China state dinner. 
 Okay, tell Barack that... yes, but this is the last one for the next few months. 
 And after this press conference, I want you to cancel all my meetings. 
 All of them? 
 Yes. And tell my sons to meet me at my house. 
 I started selling drugs when I was nine years old in Philadelphia. 
 I did it to feed myself. 
 But it was the music... that played in my head that kept me alive when I thought I was gonna get shot. 
 And it was the melodies that... 
 I dreamt about that kept me warm while I was sleeping in the streets. 
 ♪ Lyrically, I'm on point, flowing double joint ♪ 
♪ You just a little boy, you a boy ♪ 
♪ I'm a man, you should be playing ♪ 
 (faint whooping) 
 * With your toys! * 
 You see, music saved my life. 
 Times have changed, though. 
 The Internet has destroyed the musician's ability to make money, because our work is downloaded for free online. 
 And now it's impossible for the disenfranchised kids growing up in the projects to overcome poverty the way that I did. 
 We are gonna change all of that. 
 I am proud to announce that Empire Entertainment has filed to become a publicly traded company on the New York Stock Exchange. 
 Rita, did you bring the hummus? 
 Hey, y'all. 
 Jamal, how's that friend of yours? 
 Good. Why you flake on dinner last Tuesday? 
 Schedule was crazy. 
 I mean, but you could've called or something. 
 Like, we cooked and everything. That's so rude. 
 I forgot. 
 I'm glad you're all here. 
 And get your big-ass feet off my $40,000 table! 
 I eat there! 
 Your brother and I have been working hard to turn Empire into a publicly traded company. 
 Now part of us going public means ensuring a legacy for this company, and right now it seems none of you are prepared to take over after I'm gone. 
 Now, it won't happen today, nor tomorrow... 
 but I will start grooming someone soon. 
 And it can only be one of you. 
 What is this, we... we King Lear now? Call it what you want, smart-ass, but over the next several months... Wait, wait. What are you saying? We're all in competition to be the future head of the company? In order for it to survive, I need one of you Negroes to man up and lead it. And nothing or no one is going to tear it down, hear me? Thought I'd never see this day. Ink. Roll it. Last time I'm gonna be doing this. (chuckles) (gate creaks) (laughs) (gate buzzes) (buzzing) Cookie's coming home. (distorted grunt) (grunting) You know how much money we're gonna make off this boy? You sound like Don King, Dad. Don't say nothin' bad about Dr. King. (laughing nearby) (continues laughing) Hey, Bunkie, give us a minute. What, right now? Yeah, right now. I need to talk family business with my son. You remember when you were 11, sonny? (laughs): Dressing up in a little suit, trying to run into the office, helping everybody, answering phones. Even during my finals at Penn, I was still coming back, doing your accounting. Put your heart and guts into this company. I mean, your whole life is Empire. You went on to grad school. Taught me a few things, too. Which makes me the most qualified to run the company, Dad. And don't you think, since this is a celebrity-driven brand, it should be run by a celebrity? No, I don't. We're going public, Dre... I got to think about all of this stuff. This successor talk have anything to do with Cookie? What you talking about, Cookie? I haven't spoken to her since she got out. I figured you had. Cookie's out? It's your job to know. Slipped by me. Slipped by you? Look, Money, you knew she was gonna get out eventually. Why you starting with Cookie? She ain't nothin'. From this moment forward, I want to know everything she's doing. I mean everything. All right. Oh, hey, Money, I need 25. Oh, that's the last time, I swear. I told you, if you ain't got the money, don't make the bet. I want to know everything. He'd never pick me anyway. Why? Way too much homophobia in the black community. It's 2015. Nobody cares. There's football players coming out. (sighs) Well, I don't want it anyway... so whatever. Then what do you want? You don't want to release an album, you won't tour. Seen it my whole life. Hey, look at my dad. That's a real artist. Well, he was. Now he's more concerned with selling T-shirts and watches and whatever. (phone rings) Hello. Let me in. Who's this? Let me in. Y'all better have a elevator up in here. My feet hurt. Go in there and tell your mama I love her, and don't come back here crying. (indistinct, overlapping chatter) When you coming home, Mama? I told you to stop asking me that. Where's your father? He's not coming to see you today. Yeah, okay. How you doing in school, little man? My friends are picking on me. Bashir stole my lunch. I'm afraid to tell Dad. He'll tell me to fight. Listen to me. You different. Okay? It's only something Mama knows, but it's gonna make life hard for you sometimes. But I want you to always remember I got you. You hear me? Come here. I got you. Okay? Hey, she's coming. Oh, my God. How? I don't know. Did you tell her about us? Um... And this. Take that. (doors clack open) Oh. (sighs) Mmm. For a queen, you sure do keep a messy place. What you need is a good maid up in here. You cooking chicken? Oh, yeah, yeah. Um... Did you fry it? No, I stewed it, but it's here this way. Stewed? Might be a little spicy for you. Stewed chicken. It's the way we like it, so, you know. Uh, who is this? Hi. Oh. That's Michael. Michael. Uh, we're sort of living together. Uh, look, Mommy, I know you're hungry. Oh. Oh, honey, you didn't tell me you was dating a little Mexican. Look at her. She's adorable. Yeah, I said "a little Mexican." (Michael laughs) You need to get La Cucaracha to clean up around here a bit. Uh, what are you wearing? (sighs) What I got locked up in. Well, we gonna change that real quick. And why didn't you call me? I would have picked you up. I just got out. Good behavior. All right, so, what are you gonna do now? I'm here to get what's mine. - You can't just go in there. Get your ass out of the way. Ladies and gentlemen, the queen has returned. Wow. 17 years later, and you are still beautiful. So, when did you get out? Two days ago. You really, uh... It was your sacrifice that made a lot of this possible. I can't imagine what you've been through, Cookie. But you've got to know you're not the only one that suffered in this. You forgot about me the second you divorced me in there. You still owe me what's mine. What are you talking about? Half of this company. It was my $400,000 that started this bitch. You know it, and I know it. Did 17 hard years for that money, and I want half my company back. (laughing): I'm sorry, Cookie, but it don't work like that. It don't work like what, honey? This company isn't the company that we started 17 years ago. As a matter of fact, I control maybe ten percent of this damn thing. I've got a board of directors, quarterly reports, SEC filings. And on top of it, we're about to go public, which is a whole nother monster in itself. Public? What the hell is public? Baby, I can give you a huge salary, but I can't give you half of my company. Your? Your company? I can't give you any of it. This is my company, Lucious. I s...! I started this. You need to stop playing with me. I promise you, anything you want, you can get. $5 million... a year, and I want to be head of A&R. The board will never approve $5 million. You talk to your board. I can get you close to $3 million. Yeah, figure it out. You the boss. I can't do A&R. Why? I have someone. Is it little Halle Berry over here? (sighs) You're not sweeping me under the carpet, Lucious.

Now I see why you kept me from her. She a psychotic animal, Dad. I don't know that woman. You're just like her. You know, when, uh, Cookie got sent away, the judge told us 30 years. Now, I was devastated. Thank you, baby. I didn't know nothing about raising y'all. Cookie did all of that. Give me that tissue. Thank you. Anyway, Dottie came along, fell for me hard, said she wanted to raise y'all. You weren't even one yet. And Cookie didn't want y'all visiting her in jail, and that was fine with Dottie. What I'm saying is... your mama wasn't a bad person. We just was in a real bad situation, you know. Whatever happened to Miss Dottie? She got shot on 42nd and Walnut. You need to get your act together. (sighs) You gonna pull out a phone when I'm talking to you? But you're wasting your talents on bitches and booze. I'm working on new stuff now, and you know that. You ain't worked a day in your life, and you know that. You're spoiled. But I got some new heat for you, some stuff that I wrote. We gonna go in and record it, and we gonna put some candy on this thing. You feel me? Candy. (snoring) What you doing here? You look a mess. You been drinking again, ain't you, Bunkie? Get that mess off your face! What's going on, Bunkie? I'll tell you what's going on. Lucious keeping me down. And we used to be like brothers. You know what I'm saying? Now he treats me like I'm the butler. Practically raised the kids while you was inside. Yeah. You're right. I appreciate you for that, too, Bunkie. Lucious got you following me, don't he? Don't he? What you gonna tell him? I didn't see you. My dawg. Hey, something's going on. I don't know what it is. Got... it's got him scared. Well, you best be careful, 'cause he's on a warpath. Liable to do anything. I got his war. Give me that sandwich. I can't finish that? Man, hop on the treadmill. (laughs) First of all, who goes to bathhouses anymore, and... Me. No, but how'd you even get into it? I told 'em I was pre-op, and they didn't want to check. Them papers on my desk I need to sign? Mm-hmm. 
 
 Your son's here. Hey, Mal. Hey. How's that roommate of yours, the one with the dress? Uh, I'm seeing Michael now, Dad. You met him twice. I'm sorry. All right, what's up? Was, uh, surprised to get your call. Look, Mal, this is the last time I'm gonna have this talk with you. Your sexuality... That's a choice, son. You can choose to sleep with women if you want. I'm saying this to help you, 'cause I know eventually, you're gonna release another album. Yeah, I know, Dad. And there's people out in this country that don't appreciate people like you. Yeah, I... I-I get it. 'Cause a sissy can't sell records to the black community. I get it. Or the white kids that make up 75% of our sales. And you really need to stop calling yourself that. Well, that's what I am, Dad. I'm trying to help you, son. Then why don't you get to know me? Why don't you spend some time with me? Get to know you? I know you better than you know you. Look, you want to spend some time with me? Release another album. Why is everything always about business with you? Take that damn bass out of your voice when you're talking to me! He be growling like a little silverback, I know, I know. My little man, there. Lucious, I don't like the way your voice sound in the mix. Your voice should be above the mix. And right now it sounds like you hiding behind it. What difference it make, anyway? They all passed. They don't want to hear nothing about Philly streets, they want Color Me Badd. Well, they all gonna love your gangsta ass soon enough, you hear me? I love your gangsta ass. (laughs) The album is great. All that's missing is that single to take it over the top. Yeah, well, why don't you take main man right now? Okay. I'm gonna get at some of this food. Are you listening to me? Yes, I'm listening. Give me a kiss. Grumpy. You gonna let me have some tonight? (laughs) Shut up. Lucious. Are you out of your damn mind? Walking in here looking like a little bitch? Get over here. Lucious, no! Lucious! Lucious! (baby crying) Take your pills. (sighs) Ow! He's always loved them more than me. Even Jamal, who he hates. You know he's gonna leave it all to Hakeem, don't you? And Jamal won't object, because he's too passive. But what if he did? What if Jamal made a play for the company and your two brothers went to war? They just may kill each other. And I'm the last man standing. And you... are the last man standing. It could be a tricky play, though. You know they're tight. Do you really want this company? (banging) Who is it? It's Andre. Oh. Okay. Hey, Mama. Hey, Andre. So Dad set you up, huh? I'm proud of you. You really made something of yourself. Thank you, Mama. I'm sorry I never came to visit. Too ashamed of your dope-dealing ma? I'm sorry, I truly am. I'm sorry. Why you marry that white girl? We met at school. She's brilliant. Pretty white girls always are, even when they ain't. Thanks for helping me with my apartment, baby. Have you ever thought about managing Jamal? Yes. I told Lucious I wanted to be head of A&R. But he's shutting me out. He doesn't want Jamal to be a star because that would position him to be the head of the company. Is that what that white girl's telling you? I want Empire. I've worked hard for this company. But I'm not an artist, and Dad's not gonna pick me. What do you want from me? I want you to manage Jamal. You can make him a star just like you made Dad a star. I've got no leverage to make Lucious give me Jamal. You have more than you realize. What's that? You really love me, Ma? Okay. - Here's what we got to do. We've reached this historic moment. No other music company has ever accomplished... Don't forget to thank me, baby. Don't forget to thank your Cookie on this historic occasion. Hello. Good to see you, Cookie. Vernon, kiss my black ass. Andre. Now... let's talk business, shall we? Hey, sistergirl. Will you guys excuse us for a moment, please? Yes, excuse us for a moment, please. Cookie, can I talk to you? Lucious. Don't touch me like that. Have some cupcakes on us. We'll be right back. Page three, ladies and gentlemen. Are you out of your damn mind? I told you I was gonna hook you up. And I'm telling you that's not enough. I want Jamal, too. You can't have him. You messing with the wrong bitch, Lucious. I know things. What do you know? What if I were to disclose to the SEC that I was the original investor with $400,000 in drug money? Yeah. Your application for an IPO would be effectively denied. Shut your mouth. You know how stupid you sound? Tell me to shut up again, bitch. (chuckles) You know it's true. Baby... Why are you doing this? (scoffs) Don't you "baby" me, you two-faced b*st*rd. I've been living like a dog for 17 years and now I want what's mine. I want Jamal. And you would sink this whole empire over that? Give me Jamal. You got him. It's nice to see you again, Vernon. Good to see you, Cookie. I never wanted him anyway. I know. ♪ I give you all of me ♪

Yeah, well, if you do end up working with her and Pop's handling me, best believe they try to make us kill each other. That ain't gonna happen. Let's go. I got to talk to a friend of mine first.

Lucious, listen to me. If I were to go down... You're not... What are you talking about? Promise me you'll keep playing. Look, ain't nothing gonna happen to you. Baby, this album is gonna be big. I can feel it. Why don't you stop worrying? I promise, ain't nothing gonna happen to you. Nothing's gonna tear my family apart. Man : In exchange for the salary and control over Jamal Lyon's career, you are signing away your rights to ever disclose you were the initial investor in Empire Enterprises. Furthermore, I would like to draw your attention to subsection number eight. This disclosure... Now, you're the only one that could truly run this company. I'll do everything I can to help you. Just don't forget me when you're in that pilot seat. How could I forget about you, Uncle Vernon? Looks like Bunkie is getting real tight with Shyne Johnson. And he owes him $150K. Now, you know Shyne runs everything from... Hunts Point all the way up to damn near New Rochelle. Drugs, cards, girls. He's dangerous. It's not gonna be so easy to make him go away. (train passing) Boo. Damn, man, come on, man. (chuckling) Did I get you? 'Cause this got me. So? So? So what? You been a sellout for years. You can fool this country you legit, but I know you ain't nothing but a punk-ass gangsta. You gonna give me my money? Shyne ain't gonna stop till he gets it. We've been friends since we were 14 years old. I never let anything come between a friendship... except a bullet. (gunshot) (body thuds) ♪ ♪ So, what horse did you steal this from? (laughing) Jamal got me wearing this mess. You know I was never into wearing all them damn weaves. Girls walking around with their scalps smelling like goat ass. You know, I miss your honesty. I'm so sorry I didn't visit you in jail. Save that pimp talk for Anika. Or one of them other young girls you messin' around with. You want to know what I'm messing with? Listen. ♪ What's that over there? ♪ * That that... right there... * Hmm. That's hot. You know what Uncle James would call that, don't you? A big fat hit. And you need to chill with all that Uncle James crap, because you are not related to James Brown. I am so. You are a pathological liar. And no matter what you do with Jamal, he's never gonna be as big as Hakeem. The boy ain't got it. He's your son, Lucious. You really aren't ashamed of him. No. Really? I'm not. I'm gonna make him a star. And I will take anything down that gets in my way. I ain't got time for this. Yeah, well... you better make time, Lucious. We fittin' to go to war. Oh. I'm sorry. Well, this is war. Come on, Cookie, why are you doing this? I want to show you a faggot really can run this company. (cheering, whooping) Clap. Ladies and gentlemen... it is my great honor to welcome back the heart and soul of Empire Enterprises, Ms. Cookie Lyon. To Cookie. (whooping, clapping) This year my two sons, Hakeem and Jamal Lyon, both are releasing new albums! (whooping, cheering) ♪ Armani, Armani, I keep a crease ♪ 
♪ On my hip like I'm Ronnie ♪ 
♪ Raised up in Philly, I'm M.I.A. ♪ 
♪ So be surprised if you spot me ♪
