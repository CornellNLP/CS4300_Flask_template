 Previously on Empire... 
 She working with Beretti. 
 Anika : You are accusing me of betrayal? 
 After all those women, all those lies, and now her? 
 I told you that's over. 
 It's not over. 
 It's over! 
 Vernon : Olivia's living with some dude put his hands on her, so she got an order of protection against him. 
 Jamal, you think there's a possibility that this little girl might Yeah. Cookie : Nothing good can come from loving you. You know I got rules, right? Oh, man, break the rules! Lucious is my boss. Listen, you're off limits to me. I think I would be the most qualified to be the interim head of the company if for any reason Lucious Lyon were to be temporarily incapacitated. Lucious : You will never run my company! I work harder than anybody up in here. I made Empire! (Indistinct shouting) Hold him down. Cookie : Lucious, don't do this. (Sighs) (Sniffles, clears her throat) Lucious ain't gonna make it, but he said he's gonna see you tomorrow, baby, at the house when we sign those papers for the IPO. Man : Should we go ahead without him? Sure. ♪ I'm robbing you for your love ♪

♪ Won't you just give it up? ♪ I'm Dr. Sirak, Andre's psychiatrist, and this is Michelle White, our music therapist. Music therapy?! Are y'all serious? (Sighs) Don't worry about it, Andre. Mama gonna put a lid on that. Music therapy can be very effective treating bipolar disorder. It helps with stress, depression, extreme highs and lows and thoughts of suicide. Sirak : Andre responds well to it. And plus, he responds well to all the money we finna make. Bro, are you excited that we got this IPO thing started? Yeah. Jamal : Yeah, man, that's-that's all 'cause of you, Dre. It's... Cookie : Yeah. Us signing over these shares... That's crazy symbolic. This is the final step before your company is publicly traded, babe. You have to be there. Cookie : Hey, hey, just everybody hold on for a minute. And what is this bipolar disorder? Is this your idea? Mine? Yes, yours. Yeah, 'cause you know that wack stuff that psychiatrist said and-and music therapy, whatever this is... That's white people problems. See, 'cause my baby's strong. He's a Lyon. He can beat anything. No, this isn't a white person thing, Cookie. I was diagnosed my junior year in college. That was when he had his first psychotic break. Never fear. Andre's here. (Laughs) I got presents. Presents for everybody. Dre, why you away from school? Olivia! Let's see what I got for my dear, darling sister-in-law. School is for ordinary people, J. Andre is... exceptional. Jamal : What's wrong with you? Lucious, is this your oldest? Yeah. Uh, they call me Andre Lyon, pretty lady. You can call me... Santa Claus. (Laughs) She's pretty, papa. Hey. Why you tripping, man? Pop, I'm good! Hey, it's Christmas in July, pops. Ho, ho, ho. Oh, it's not July, though, is it? Y'all, Andre's tripping. It's all... it's christmastime. I got watches, I got scarves, got hats. Andre... No, no. Whoa, whoa. Dre, come here. Oh, what's going on? Jamal : What's wrong with him? Andre : I love you, dad. That's why I came. What are you smoking? Smoking nothing. Smoking happiness. Merry Christmas. God bless everyone! Andre. I'm so sorry I wasn't there for you, baby. I'm so sorry. We gonna go to your daddy's house, and we gonna sign away your shares so the company can become public. This is all happening because of you, Dre. Jamal : Dre, it's all 'cause of you. Know what I'm saying? Empire going public. We wouldn't even know what IPO was if it wasn't for you. Hakeem : And dad still needs you. You know he can't bring this thing home without you, bro. Come here. Come here. I don't what's gonna happen, but whatever that judge says, I want you to remember mommy loves you. Don't you ever forget that, ok? (Crying): He won't talk. Rhonda : I know. (Sniffling) So you really are trying to give Cookie the same amount of shares as the boys, huh? My way of thinking is, if she has her own, she's not gonna give me that much trouble when I ask her to sign the prenup. Come on, man, you're not seriously thinking about marrying her again? I want to spend the rest of my life with Cookie. Having my family with me before I die... that's what's important. Well, if family's important to you, you need to go to the hospital and see Andre. (Sighs) Yeah, I don't want to see him like that. I'll see him at the house when we do the transfer of the stock. Okay. So you think Cookie's gonna be okay with this? Cookie missed out on raising our-our boys. We got a second chance now with Lola. She loves her. Yeah, me, Lola and Cookie. I'm gonna get it right this time. Oh. We got reasons to be cheerful, bro. Can't believe we're about to take this thing public. After all these years. Come on, now, don't leave me hanging. We? You mean me. This is mine. I built this. Yeah, right. So this is about me and Dre, huh? And the temporary incapacitation, now. We were trying to protect you, bro. Yeah. You tried to pull a cool on me. Now, Andre I expect that from because he's book-smart, but you... you from the streets. You ought to know better. At least I thought you did. All right. Like you said, all right? This is all you, right? This your company. (Knocking at door) Come in. May I have a word? Did I violate some top secret, super classified security code? No. I'm the one that violated the code. My own personal code of conduct. And that is a problem. Yeah, well, I'm sure you know I got a nasty rap sheet, so I'm not really one to judge. Well, I've been disloyal to my commander by falling for his wife. That is a serious breach of every pledge I've ever sworn. So I hope you understand I will be keeping my distance and... I didn't want you to think I wasn't, you know, around. Yeah. Um, wait. Are you saying you're falling for me? I'm saying that. I can't stop thinking about you. And I'm sorry if I overstepped.

Lyrics are deep. It's beautiful. Thank you. I gotta ask you something about it, though. It's... What's up? Is it just a song, or is... Is that really you? Oh. I mean, I don't think that Lola should be staying with my dad. You know, especially since Anika's gone. Thinking about taking her off his hands. That's a big step. Yeah, well, you were the one that told me I should spend time with her, right? Yeah, I know. It's... I respect your decision, Jamal, so much. Like... It's beyond. I don't know, I guess you're a better man than me. Ryan, come on, man. It's not like I'm asking you to co-parent or something. I know. Obviously, we're not there yet. I-I know. It's just... It's not something that I see taking on. Right. I respect your decision, too. Doesn't change mine, you know. She's my daughter. I want to raise her. Right here. All right. All right. Man : Well, look what I found. Hey, hey, hey. Where is Lola? Reg, please. See, you can run, but you can't hide. (Whimpers) And don't walk away from daddy. Hey, hey, hey, hey. Let's go get Lola. All right? Just walk. (Whispering): Please... You belong to me, and so does Lola. ♪ Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey ♪ Baby, I don't feel like doing this right now. ♪ Hey, hey. ♪ I'm still worried about Dre. I know you're hurting. I know you feel deeply about your brother. Unlike your father, who is a brute. I'm just really bummed he didn't come to the hospital with us. You know? But we got to cut dad slack. He is sick, you know? Well, Cookie may be vulgar, but at least she does make Jamal better, which is what I'm trying to do with you. We've got to keep our eye on that prize. Give me another one.

We are like Antony and Cleopatra, darling. Yeah, we just like them. Hey, babe. (Sighs) Should we go get changed? You ready to make your dad a billionaire? This is your night, Andre. When you sign those papers, your dad is gonna see that you are the only one that... I'm not going. What do you mean you're not going? Vernon says dad doesn't want to see me like this. Well, this is me. This is who I am. (Sighs) Andre, please. You can't let them win. You have worked too hard for this. I don't care about winning. Well, you can't just stay here. Why not? Because... I need you, Andre. I am nothing without you. Get off of me! I'm giving you my proxy, and you can sign for the shares. I had Vernon prepare a signed power of attorney. It's in an envelope at the front desk. You get the hell out of here. Not sleepy. Oh, really? Well, look, Lola-bear is very sleepy and wants you to close your eyes. But-but Scary Bird is gonna get us. What's Scary Bird? Is that a monster? Hmm? All right. I promise I won't let him get you. He tries to hurt mommy. There's no Scary Birds here, baby. Well, I'll tell you what. There's definitely no scary birds at my house. Think you'd want to come live with me? Will Mommy be there? No, but... I'll protect you. I promise I'll never let anything hurt you. What do you say? Want to come live with daddy? Yes. Yeah? (Chuckles) (Snorting sounds) (Chuckles) Three, two, one... Man, just do the damn thing and stop wasting my time. Thank you. Congratulations. Ms. Cookie Lyon, you are now the head of A&R for Empire records. What are you talking about, Lucious? That's what you wanted. The position's open. Well, whatever Cookie wants, Cookie gets. I want you to be a better father. I want you to think about what our sons need instead of being so self-serving all the time. And... I want to produce your tribute concert. But under my own banner. Cookie Lyon presents... The Lucious Lyon sound. Hey. Cookie and Lucious Lyon, together... Again. What are you talking about? Hey, dad, um, can I talk to you for a second? Hold that thought.

Look, that's one of the reasons why I've decided I'm gonna take Lola. You've decided? Yes, sir. It's my responsibility. I should step up. You don't have to do that, Jamal. I want to. I'm going to. No, Lola don't need to be raised in that kind of lifestyle, son. Really? What lifestyle is that? Don't be a smart ass, Jamal. You know what I'm talking about. Look, if you love Lola, you want what's best for her, right? What if she's not perfect? What if she has that trait that you just can't seem to look at? Andre, can you hear me, babe? I'm gonna come visit you, okay? Dad... Man : Uh, Mr. Lyon, your son has a serious mental illness. If he gets the right care, he can lead... Shut the hell up. Gone. Y'all get out of here. Wait, wait. Where are they taking him, though? Your brother's been working too hard at school. He just needs a little vacation. And you, little rich white girl, don't you dare share this with nobody at your school. This is a family matter. I won't say anything. Mental illness? No! No one will refer to my son as having a mental illness. Do you understand me? (Cell phone beeping) (Chuckles quietly) Como estás, señorita? Hey. I need to report a code violation. You're talking about the violation that's taking place in the dining room of the Lyons' residence, I'm on that, ma'am. Do you have a camera on me? (Laughs) Where is it? Oh, it's looking out from that picture, isn't it? Mm-hmm. I'm gonna give you a reason to arrest me for indecent exposure. I'm tracking you with your phone's GPS. There is no camera. (Laughs) Well, too bad, 'cause I'm not wearing any panties. Well, I still want to handcuff you. Ooh, you talking dirty to me, daddy. Baby, guess who decided out of nowhere that they want to be a daddy. Uh, Carol, girl, uh, you know I told you, you gotta have that oil bubbling hot when you put your chicken in. Yeah, so call me later. Let me know how it works out. All right, bye. He's doing the right thing, Lucious. You need to support him. I have been, but you know that... That Lola belongs here. And I recall... You wanting to raise a little girl. What are you...? Well, looky here. Y'all all coordinated. See, Lucious? You just got to coordinate. Hakeem : Hey, yo, I hope y'all don't mind, I brought Camilla. We've got a new song we want to play for y'all tonight. So, Yoko, you got the tambourine under that fur? Hakeem : Cut it out, ma. Can we be civil, Cookie? For Hakeem's sake? Yeah, okay. For Hakeem's sake. 'Cause I love you, Hakeem. 
 
 She got her drawers wrapped around my baby's neck. He can't breathe. Jamal : That's a good one. Yeah. Hakeem : She's designing all my looks. Look how cute he looks there. That's a good one. Hakeem : That's how you build our brand. And Camilla had some extra material, so she made me a scarf. Aw, fool, looks good. You look chic. She say we're like the new Antony and Cleopatra. (Laughs) Child... Jamal : Y'all know that's a tragedy, where they end up dying at the end, right? Stop, boy. Hey, everyone. This is Ms. Jaworski. She is our notary for the night. Hi. Who's ready to sign these papers so we can get rich? Not until Andre and Rhonda get here. Okay. Hey, why don't you help yourself to the buffet while we wait? Yes, sir. Well, this seems like a good time. Lucious : A good time for what? Well, Hakeem and I share some feelings... Oh they're sharing feelings now, y'all. Camilla : Is that Hakeem's musical palette is limited for an artist at his level. He should be expanding beyond the simplistic rapping... Wait, wait. Hold on, miss thing. He's a rapper. That's what he does. He wraps. Dad, just check her out. Go ahead, baby. Like, in the beginning, the Lucious Lyon sound drew on a variety of influences.

So... Do you love my son or don't you? Yes, very much. I need to know how much. Well, you can't quantify it. If that's what you're asking. I mean, you're not here for nothing. And you had to know showing up here, you were going to get a reaction, right? And you been around the block, and I'm not judging just from your little accent. You knew showing up at my house... on this night... That's a big move. So how much? There's no amount of money... See? I wasn't even thinking about money, but you sure were. (Click) I didn't say you were dismissed. You are not gonna keep me in here. Sit down. Hakeem's been jumpy lately, but your name keeps popping up. I need to know how much it will cost to make you... Disappear. Now I'm talking of money. There's no amount of money, Lucious, that's gonna make me go away from Hakeem. Do you understand? This is a big night for me, Camilla. Pulling this IPO off before I die and getting my family where it's supposed to be. I have investigated your financial situation. You are in debt up to your neck, your business is underwater, you are selling your clothes that you strut around in. I am going to offer you a great deal of money to go as far away from my son as humanly possible. You know how God made man in his image? I'm making Hakeem in my image. God didn't need no help, and neither do I. After all this, you're saying you want to take Lola back? Yeah. Yeah, that's right. How is she? I do miss her. Oh, great. Where's Andre? You might want to ask your husband that, Cookie. I don't have a husband, Rhonda. (Car door closes, alarm chirps) Hey, what are you doing here? I'm sorry to disturb your evening, but Mr. Lyon called.

Once you are out of my son's range, I will deposit the rest into your bank account. I don't want your money. And as soon as I hear that you're dead, I will take the first flight back. Do you hear me? Ms. Marks, please, this way. Don't touch me. He will forget you in a month. And in six months, you'll be rotting in a wheelchair like a vegetable with a colostomy bag trailing behind you. You are a disgusting, despicable human being. And I wish you a miserable death when you go to hell. Bon voyage. Finally, everybody's here. Let's sign these papers. Where's Andre? He didn't want to leave the hospital, so I'm his proxy. Well, hold on, hold on. I'm not signing over Andre's stock to some little country club queen just because his feelings are hurt. Look, you want to raise your family's fortune, Rhonda, You're gonna have to work for that. I've been with your son for ten years, and you don't know a damn thing about me. But just to clarify, I came from nothing. And I worked my ass off to put myself through Penn. Nothing has ever been handed to me, and I have never expected anything to, either. Where do I sign? Okay, why does it say 750,000 shares and not a million? Well, that was before. And this is Common B shares, not the voting A shares that he was promised. Really, Lucious? You gonna cheat Andre on top of everything else? I'm not cheating anybody. She don't even know what she's talking about. Rhonda : Well, it looks like he reduced Hakeem and Jamal's as well. What the hell is wrong with you, Lucious?! I did it for you. I-I took shares from everyone, so I could give some to you, Cookie. And how many shares did you personally give up, Lucious? He stole from his sons to buy your loyalty. That's what he did. "Stole"? This is all mine. I'm sharing my stock with you. Here we go. Okay. You ungrateful little grub. You did it all alone. Yo, yo, yo, wait, wait, wait. What's going on? What's going on? Where's Camilla? What up, fam. Let's get this party started. Uncle Vernon is here. I'm bringing some guests. Say hi to everybody.

I don't know him. He's.. You don't know him, but he's in my house? No, but he's the one that convinced her to come get her kid. So, how bad could that be? And you brought him here. Yeah, but you know what? I can go find out for sure who he is. No, hold on, hold on. That's what I do for you. I got you, man. I got this for you. No, no, man. No, dude! I got this, man!

Dad, you seen Camilla? I can't find her nowhere. Well, stop looking for her... She's gone. She left with Malcolm. With Malcolm? Where? At the airport. Or on the plane by now. I asked her how much money it would cost to make her walk away from you and stop playing with your mind. Did she take your money? What do you think? Cookie  (Whistles): Dude, those some crazy tats. (Chuckles) Let me see what you into. What's that? A-a bird, a demon? What is that? It's a crow. Crows eat dead people. And dead animals. That's what you into? Nah, not particularly. No, don't, don't... Just joking. Scary bird. Lola has nightmares about birds. Is that him? Olivia, does he hurt her? (Whispering): Help me. I'm gonna go get Lola. No. You the one she's scared of. I should kick your ass. Olivia : Put the gun down, Reggie! Oh, my God. Reggie, put it down! I should have smoked your ass... What the hell is going on?! Hold on a second! Hold on! No! Dude, don't... Everybody, shut up! You need to leave right now. Shut up, shut up! Just calm down, dude. Trying to take what mine. Olivia's my lady. You put a ring on it, put a baby in her. Reg, Jamal was my husband before you were my man. No, see, y'all got all the money, you think you can do whatever you want, right? Man, that's it? You want some money? Ain't a problem when you in this family, man. You want some diamonds? Here, take this watch. $30,000. No, it ain't about no watch. See, you took her from me... Just shut the hell up, and tell me what you want. What I want... No! Is to kill your ass. Do it. Do it. Do it! Don't! Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop! It was me! I'm the father. I put the baby in her, not him. I did it. It was me. I'm the father of the baby. Shoot me! Is that true? Hey, hey, hey. Don't! Stop! Stop! No! Stop! No, no, no, no, wait, wait, wait. Dude, I done came clean. It's me. I'm the one that promised her that if she married Jamal, I was gonna make her a star. I'm the one that got her pregnant. She was lonely. Jamal wouldn't touch her. I took advantage. I'm the bad man. If you kill me, everyone in this room would applaud. You see the little pretty blonde there? She hates me. My son... Wants me dead because I saved him from a con artist. But the worst thing that I did... I let the mother of my children rot in jail for 17 years. So trust me, Reg, if you shoot me, you would be everybody's personal hero. Shoot me right here. Let her go. Be the hero. Just let her go. Nah, man, don't come any closer! Would you just let her go?! (Gun fires) (Screaming) Oh, my God. Everybody, away. Get back. Get back. Move. Are you all right? I thought I lost you. I wish he would have shot you. He dead. Come on, I got you. All right, let's get some air. I got you. Lucious : What you looking at, huh? I saved your ass. You the one that left... No word, no nothing. Jamal, I left because you were so horribly unhappy. You hated pretending to love me. I was never gonna be in your life again, but I had to get Lola away from Reg. And I had nowhere else to go. And you could be her daddy. Probably not. Hey. It's okay. But I knew you would take care of her. Because you're kind. Reg said he was gonna kill me and Lola before he'd let us go. I was running away to my cousins in Florida when he found me. And I never meant to hurt any of you. I swear I didn't. I swear I am so sorry. Cookie : It's all right. You left your baby to save her. There's nothing harder than that. And now that he's gone, I'm gonna be the best mother I can be. I promise I will. Come here, babe. Jamal : Say bye to everybody, hmm? Rhonda : Bye, sweetheart. Bye, Rhonda. (Chuckles) You come back and visit whenever you want, okay? Okay. (Chuckles) Don't be sad. Don't be mad. How could I be mad at my Lola-bear? You gonna be good? Good-bye, baby girl. Bye. You be good to your mom, okay? Okay. Cookie : So that when you grow up, you can be just as strong as her. Cookie : Okay? Lola : Okay. (Grunts) Can I still sing the Lyon song? 'Cause I'm still a Lyon, right? (Chuckles) You'll always be a Lyon. So you won't get scared. I won't be scared. Oh, let me help you with this. Girl, I missed you. Thank you. Bye-bye. Bye-bye. Y'all be safe. Man : This way, ma'am. Cookie : You wanted to see me? You know, Cookie, there was a lot I wanted to say to you last night that I didn't get a chance to say to you. Yeah, well, after last night, you might want to leave a lot unsaid. No, no, I realized last night that I don't ever want to be in that position again that I could lose you. I don't know how much time I got left in this world, but... I got 18,000 square feet. I'll share it with you. (Chuckles mildly) 18 thou... (Sighs) Are you asking me to move in with you, Lucious? No, I'm asking you to be my one again. I mean, we conceived all of this. You and me. We built this together, we fought for this, we-we defended this. You know, when I first got out of prison, I had a stupid fantasy about us getting back together. So stupid. So I made mistakes. And? I'll spend the rest of my life fixing 'em. Lucious, you don't care about nothing but yourself. Everything you touch, you destroy. Look at what you did to my sons. I can do better, Cookie. And in the end, you're gonna understand the choices I've made. I promise you, I can do better. I... You just don't want to die alone. It all looks good. All right. This is all the same info, really. Mm-hmm. Nothing... Right. There's nothing really different in here. Malcolm, excuse me. I need to talk to you a minute. Okay, give me a second. I got your message. You okay? Y-you're not having any PTSD reactions, are...? Take me somewhere with you, Malcolm. I want to be alone with you. Okay, let's do that.
