 Hakeem :  Previously on Empire... 
 Cookie :  I did 17 hard years for that money. 
 He doesn't have a pulse. 
 Rhonda :  If we were suspects,  we would've been hauled in already. 
 You have quite the fans. 
 Does it cause jealousy? 
 Mimi : Empire is Lucious Lyon. 
 Without him, the company's nothing. 
 Anika : Lucious, he wants your music, Cookie. 
 Every track, he wants everything. 
 I got this girl group  I'm producing right now. 
 You need a real label behind you. 
 Sorry, Hakeem. 
 Lucious : I bought Apex Radio. 
 Now your little label dries up and dies. 
 You're gonna be a grandfather. 
 An heir? 
 I got a feeling about a second phase for Empire. 
 Yeah. 
 You're never gonna find Vernon Turner. 
 Your case is stalled. 
 A murder rap is only the beginning of what I have planned for you.

 Man : That was amazing. 
 Thank you. 
 That was good. You like it? 
 I love it. Thank you. 
 It's just, man, I'm-I'm a little blown away. 
 Rolling Stone,  the cover, it's crazy. 
 After the year you've had, we're lucky to get you. 
 Thank you very much. 
 So, uh, tell me about your new album. 
 It's gonna be produced by my dad... 
 Which is amazing. 
 It's gonna be called  The Artist. 
 It's basically kind of a manifesto of everything I want to become. 
 You know, it's easy to lose yourself in all of this and running Empire. 
 But this is home. 
 Doing this, this is what I do. It makes me happy. 
 Sir, uh, I'm sorry to bother you, but we have a serious situation here. 
 What the hell is going on? 
 FBI. We have a warrant. 
 Your warrant does not give you the right to ransack my father's office. 
 In fact, it does. 
 We'll be done in here shortly, Mr. Lyon. 
 Excuse me! You're violating my rights! 
 Jamal, give me your phone. 
 Handle it. 
 Get that one, too. 
 Stop! 
 Look, all I'm saying is, I-I thought that maybe after what I did for you with Pitbull, that you might reconsider teaming up with me again. 
 (chuckles) Teaming up with you? 
 Are you delusional? 
 All right, I know you don't trust me... 
 Mom, you can't trust anybody in this music business. 
 My own dad tried to kill my girl group. 
 Boy... we got bigger problems, okay? 
 Your daddy is trying to keep us off radio. 
 So I need some songs to go viral online. 
 I need you in the studio. 
 I'm not giving up my group, Ma. 
 This business is about us being moguls, so you got to let me be a mogul. 
 I can find a new lead singer. 
 What if you don't? 
 If I can't find a girl group in a week, I-I promise I'll drop it. 
 Okay, Hakeem. 
 Don't embarrass yourself. 
 Um, y'all, something's happening at Empire. 
 What is it? 
 They're getting raided by the Feds. 
 Call Valentina, tell her Empire is going down like the  Titanic,  and she needs to come back to us. 
 You, call Royale-T. 
 If you can sign him, you back with Dynasty. 
 I'm-a go straight to Titan's house and get his black ass before lunch. 
 Payback is a bitch, Lucious. 
 Cookie Lyon, we have a warrant to search the entire premises. 
 Hey, look, I'm sorry to wake you, but we got a situation. 
 FBI just raided Empire, and there's no doubt in my mind they'll be here any moment. 
 What? How'd you get in here? 
 What are you talking about? 
 I slept in the guest room with the twins. 
 I needed that, too. Thank you. 
 (chuckles) Oh, right on. 
 But come on, chop-chop. I made coffee. 
 (distant sirens wailing) 
 Yeah, exactly. 
 Looks like our friends just arrived. 
 I'll meet them downstairs. 
 Rise and shine, baby. 
 (sirens wailing) 
 Good morning, Ms. Ford. Just-Just wait a second. 
 Article 45 states no warrant can be served in a federal case without a signature from the presiding judge. 
 No, it doesn't. Get the hell out of my face. 
 Well, can't blame a man for trying. 
 Hi there, baby. 
 Look wherever you like. 
 The FBI raid this morning was unsettling for us all, and I'm sorry to say I see no end in sight. 
 I came down here today to show my full support for Lucious Lyon. 
 In order to protect him, Jamal Lyon and I agree that we're going to curb what we're currently working on and also restrict future endeavors. 
 That's right. I'm going to also cancel my  Rolling Stone  cover. 
 Just doesn't seem like the right time. 
 The future is very uncertain. 
 That's exactly why we're going to expand immediately. 
 Dad, come on, man, you know you're not supposed to be here. 
 No, the Feds, they wanted to play dirty, they took the gloves off this morning. 
 Well, it's game time, bitches. 
 Now listen up. The reason that they are raiding Empire is because they've got nothing, absolutely nothing, otherwise, they wouldn't be shaking us down. 
 Now, I'm telling you, I'm gonna beat this rap, and we're gonna use the press from all of this to make Empire bigger than it's ever been before. 
 Mimi : Lucious, I appreciate the bravado, but I don't see how this situation is going to help our current predicament. 
 Hip-hop wasn't born on Wall Street, Miss Whiteman. 
 Where we come from, if the cops raid your house, that makes you a G. 
 If the Feds raid your house, that makes you an OG. 
 That gives you that street cred, that ghetto pass. 
 Now the public perception of Empire is that we are so raw, we are so dangerous, that even the FBI wants to shut us down. 
 This is how play as play to win. 
 That's what I'm talking about. 
 (chuckles) 
 And you are absolutely gonna do the cover of  Rolling Stone. 
 This isn't when we hide. 
 This is when we roar. 
 And I tell you, we gonna stick our foot so far up the FBI's ass, they gonna wish they never knew the name Lucious Lyon. 
 To the Empire. 
 Now, look, look, I know everybody is on edge right now, but let's just be easy. 
 This kind of blanket harassment is common in federal investigations. 
 They ain't got no case, so they're using the one open investigation to open another investigation, that's it. 
 Damn, you even talk crooked. 
 They're casting a wide net. 
 Trying to put more pressure on Dad by going after his family, too. 
 This isn't all bad news, you know. 
 It means they're desperate. 
 If I'm guessing correctly, then... 
 Vernon done switched up on them. 
 Dad, did you kill Bunkie? 
 Son, I promise you with every ounce of my soul, I could never lay a finger on that man. 
 You got to remember, Bunkie and I grew up in the streets together. 
 Before I even could look after myself, Bunkie was looking after me. 
 He introduced me to the love of my life. 
 I miss him every day. 
 So what do we do now? 
 Hakeem : Instead of steal our artists and kick us off the radio. 
 Yeah. 
 Welcome to the music business, baby. 
 I'm-a run a car over your snake oil ass. 
 Drive... 
 No, no, no, no, no, no. 
 Say it again. 
 No, no, fire and ice. 
 Say it again. 
 Hey. 
 You gotta set aside your differences, stick together. 
 This pressure is gonna continue. 
 You have to be vigilant and not give the Feds a damn thing. 
 You just gonna have to stay one big, happy family. 
 Is that possible? 
 And how long do we have to put on this show? 
 Well, this is gonna last until we find Vernon Turner. 
 I mean, if we can convince him not to testify... 
 And yes, I know, it's a little illegal, but it's for the greater cause... 
 The I guarantee you, this case getsismissed. 
 So we just have to find Vernon. 
 Vernon? Oh, my God. 
 Uncle Vernon? Vernon? 
 (grunting) 
 (retching, coughing) 
 (sighs) Oh, my God. 
 Sons of bitches. 
 (sighs) 
 Don't tell me you're getting sentimental on me? 
 I must be if I agreed to meet with you. 
 (sighs) 
 What do you want? 
 A truce. 
 You let us back on urban radio, do not poach another one of my artists, and stay away from my masters. 
 Damn, you come in here with a whole lotta demands, Miss Cookie Monster. 
 What's in it for Lucious Lyon? 
 That video Jamal wanted to do with Hakeem. 
 Hmm. 
 The boys performing together will send a message to the Feds that the Lyons are sticking with their father no matter what. 
 It's exactly what you need right now, Lucious. 
 Hakeem will do it? 
 He was pretty piss off at me last. 
 Yeah, well, he had every right to be, but it was his idea. 
 Really? 
 Yeah. 
 I told him he was crazy, but he said we gotta stick together. 
 He also said there'd be a lotta money coming in. 
 (chuckles) 
 He's starting to sound like his mama. 
 And his daddy. 
 All right. 
 They can do the video, but I'm not budging on Apex. 
 Lucious, why do you keep doing this to your son? 
 'Cause I'm trying to turn him into a man. 
 (laughs) If he wants radio bad enough, he'll find a way to get back on it. 
 Because you're Father of the Year. 
 Mmm. 
 What is in it for us? 
 Don't play me like some trick. 
 You get a free video out of it. 
 And I won't try to poach any of Lyon Dynasty's clients. 
 And you'll lay off my masters. 
 What are you talking about? 
 I never tried to take your masters. 
 That ain't what Anika say. 
 Well, she's a liar. 
 That's what that bitch does best. 
 Yeah? Well, that bitch was your woman once, so I don't know who the bigger snake is, you or her? 
 Then why are you in business with her? 
 You know why. 
 Ooh! 
 Grandma Moses just shut up for the first time. 
 Oh, you know what? Call me that again and I'll snatch your tongue out your throat. 
 Grandma. 
 Grandpa. 
 Grandma. 
 Shut up. Look at your fat stomach. Oh. 
 And if you want to see your grandchild, I would suggest you be nicer to your son. 
 Hmm. 
 Tell me a grandma that got a ass like this.

 And remember that, um, when it's finished, I'm gonna paint over it so it looks expressionistic, you know?

 I keep telling Michael that I feel like you're the new Warhol. 
 Right, babe? 
 Yeah, he's wonderful. 
 Yeah. So for you to do my  Rolling Stone  cover is-is pretty dope. 
 This is wrecking my soul. 
 Rainbows. I don't know what I was thinking. 
 You look like Lady Liberty. 
 Um... oh. 
 Try something on the keys. 
 Try playing something. 
 All right, cool. 
 Um... what do you want me to play? 
 I want you to play whatever you're feeling. 
 I want to be inside you.

 Hey. 
 Andre. 
 Look, I know we been going through a whole lot with... this case and the pressure it's putting on the family... 
 And you not letting me back in at Empire. 
 That's the consequences of what you did. 
 Consequences? Man... 
 Dad, all I do is love you and all you do is continue to shut me out. 
 Look, I'm sorry, boo. 
 I didn't grow up the way you did. 
 Woman :  Sometimes, mommies need help,  especially since she has you to take care of. 
 Your neighbors tell Child Protective Services that Mommy hasn't been feeling too good. 
 Do you feel safe here? 
 That's not true. 
 I love my boy. 
 Right, Dwight? 
 I want to stay with my mommy. 
 I want to stay with Mommy. 
 Look, there ain't a damn thing I can do about the past but I can do something about the future. 
 I just want to be the kind of grandfather that I wasn't as a father. 
 I want to... 
 I want you to know that, no matter what happens with the business, I'm gonna love and protect your child with everything that I got. 
 The door's always open for you to see your grandchild. You know that. 
 (exhales) 
 It's a boy, right? 
 You feel it? 
 Yeah, I feel it, Pop. 
 (chuckles) 
 Such a man. 
 So how you hanging in there with all this mess? 
 Man, that bitch is crazy. 
 Can I ask you a question, Pop? 
 Go ahead. 
 If I can make this all go away, will you let me back in Empire? 
 How? 
 It's a simple question, Pop. 
 If I get the case dismissed, am I the CFO again? 
 Dre, if you make this mess go away, you can have anything you want. 
 (chuckles) 
 Okay. 
 Hey, baby boy. 
 Look, I'm real glad you're doing this video. 
 I'm only doing it 'cause I can't get my own stuff on the radio. 
 Now, that's payback for you leaking that album. 
 Should be suing your ass, but I am quite impressed with how you're dealing with this adversity. 
 Inventiveness is what will help you succeed. 
 Oh, just like you succeeded on killing my girl group? 
 Look, man, I'm sorry about Valentina. 
 But... 
 I want to make it up to you. 
 I made a beat for you. 
 Dad, stop hustling me, okay? 
 I'm onto you. 
 No, I really did make this for you. 
 I'm good. 
 Okay. 
 Okay, Dad, I'll listen to it. 
 No, you good. 
 When you're ready. 
 Cookie : Why you slithering around my son? 
 What did he want? 
 Play me a beat. 
 Tryin' to get you back at Empire, isn't he? 
 Lying b*st*rd said he wouldn't poach any more of my clients. 
 Ma, you ain't gotta worry about that fool. 
 It's me and you now. 
 We're in this together. 
 Mimi. 
 I wanted to ask you... why buy into Empire? 
 When I got the word I was in full remission, I said to myself, "I'm gonna have a lot of fun with the rest of my life." 
 I'm glad you made it. 
 Uh-uh. Uh, white bitch, you gotta go. 
 It's Whiteman. 
 You know, in Russian that actually means "she who owns 20% of Empire." 
 And that translates into "she's staying." 
 Mom, we're moguls now. 
 So let's just do this video shoot. 
 Okay, Keem. 
 You the boss. 
 All right, settle down, settle down. 
 Good morning, everyone. 
 As I was just explaining to Jamal, Lucious' concept for the video is... a post-apocalyptic Black Panther theme with the brothers fighting police oppression. 
 That's real subtle, Lucious. 
 It's not a time for subtly. 
 It's time for the Lyons to send a clear message they will not tolerate police harassment of people of color. 
 So, what? You and k.d. lang, y'all best friends now? 
 Ma, we all best friends. 
 You ready, Mal? 
 Yeah, I'm ready, Hakeem. 
 Let's get it. 
 Power to the people! 
 (exhales sharply) 
 (Andre sighs) 
 
 
 
 Hey. 
 Hey. 
 You feeling okay? 
 Yeah, yeah, I'm good. 
 Yeah? 
 Why? 
 Well, I just heard you last night, so I wanted to make sure you were okay. 
 (water running) 
 (more water running) 
 Rhonda, I'm gonna dig him up. 
 Why? 
 It's my only way back into Empire. 
 If I produce the body, the case goes away. 
 No. Oh, my God, no. 
 No. Well, if you'd get caught, I go to prison. 
 I'll never let that happen to you. 
 I'll tell 'em it was me before I let that happen. 
 And this is worth spending your life in prison to do? 
 Rhonda, I need to tell you something. 
 What? 
 God's been speaking to me. 
 How has he been speaking to you? 
 I can't explain how, I just feel it. 
 Oh, my God. 
 It's okay. Listen... 
 (exhales) 
 He wants me to keep seeking Empire and I'm gonna follow his word, baby. 
 I have to follow his word.

 No, I don't want no Indian food! 
 You know it give me the... 
 (siren chirps) 
 Cookie Lyon! 
 So? 
 You're under arrest. 
 Porsha, call my lawyer! 
 I'm being harassed by the cops again. 
 Why are you arresting me?! 
 You have an outstanding warrant for failure to appear in court. 
 Oh, man, that's some bull! Get off of me! 
 Is somebody recording this?! 
 Watch your head, ma'am. 
 If I die in police custody, I did not commit suicide! 
 You can't keep me in here! 
 I didn't do nothing! 
 I know you see me in here! 
 I know my rights! 
 I want my lawyer, bitch! 
 I didn't even do nothing! 
 Man : You have a visitor. 
 Hello, Cookie. 
 It's good to see you. 
 Have a seat. 
 You can't keep me here with no probable cause, so... 
 I got cause. 
 There's a warrant out for your arrest. 
 For what? 
 You jumped a turnstile and never showed up to court. 
 (laughs): Turn... 
 Do I look like I catch the subway? 
 Seems this individual, when given a ticket, gave the name Cookie Lyon to the arresting officer. 
 Now, do you know her? 
 It's my soon-to-be ex-assistant. 
 Ah. 
 I get it. 
 You're pushing hard. 
 But for what? 
 Till I snitch on Lucious? 
 You're on parole, honey. 
 And I find the tiniest little fracture, I'll send you away for years. 
 Well, you can keep right on digging, honey. 
 'Cause me and my boys, my family, we're Lyons. 
 We're strong, so dig away. 
 Even that bipolar son of yours? 
 Yeah. 
 Honey, I will hurt your kids. 
 Real bad. 
 How is Andre gonna respond when I leak his recent medical report? 
 Ooh, child, I sure hope he don't kill himself. 
 (quiet laugh) 
 You need to kill yourself and that wack weave you got up top your head. 
 (laughs) Go ahead, Cookie. 
 Play hard, but I got you. 
 Now, if you don't give me what I want, I'll come after your boys. 
 Geez! 
 Sorry. 
 You scared the hell out of me. What are you doing here? 
 I'm coming with you. 
 No, you're not coming with me. 
 It's too dangerous. I need to be alone in case something happens. 
 No. 
 I'm ride or die. All the way. 
 Till death do us part. 
 Or prison. 
 Yeah... 
 It's hard. This beat is dope. 
 That's what I've been telling you. 
 And it's yours. 
 If what? 
 What do you think? 
 Come on back to Empire. 
 Lyon Dynasty, they don't have the resources to do what we can do for you. 
 You know it's time. Come on back home, man. 
 I'm rocking with Ma now. 
 Where is she? 
 Anybody heard from her for hours? 
 She's unreliable. 
 Look, come back to me. 
 First thing in the morning, you're back on the radio. 
 And I'll even let you manage Valentina. 
 (crying) I don't care anymore. I just want to die. 
 I just want to die. 
 Oh, God. 
 Please, please, please... 
 I can't take it anymore. 
 Please... 
 Get Roxanne Ford in here. 
 We'll see. 
 I apologize for disrupting your, um, your video shoot thing. 
 I just really needed you to see this the second it was completed. 
 It-it-it's-it's beautiful. 
 Thank you. 
 Really, thank you so much. 
 Oh, my God! 
 Oh, my God, that's astonishing. 
 You were able to capture the talent and artistry of my son. 
 You're a genius. 
 Jamal is the genius. 
 I just wanted to make a portrait worthy enough of an heir to an Empire. 
 Hey, yo, Mal, man, let's work. What is this? 
 Can't we get this out of here? 
 Why, man? It's beautiful. 
 Yeah, if tacky and ugly is beautiful. 
 You think that's, uh, tacky and ugly? 
 No, he didn't mean that. 
 Yeah, I did. It's the most ugliest painting I seen in my life. 
 Lucious : What in the hell is wrong with you, man? Why...? 
 Why can't you just be happy for your brother? 
 Because I came here to shoot a music video, but instead you got me distracted with this big-ass painting in my face. 
 If Cookie was here, she would've had this thing gone before I walked in here, you know that. 
 Well, Cookie ain't here! 
 But if you can't work without your mama being here, maybe we should shut the whole damn thing down and wait for her ass to get here! 
 I can shoot without her. 
 Ain't about nothing. 
 You sure, mama's boy? 
 Call me that one more time, you gonna see what happens. 
 You know why I made Jamal the head of the company? 
 Because he can do the work without his mama. 
 All right. 
 Let's shoot. 
 Now, remember, you'll defeat the riot squad with your brotherly love. 
 Hmm, okay.

 I'm out of here and I ain't never coming back. 
 Okay, if I give you what you need, you got to let me out of here right now. 
 I cannot miss another night with my sons. 
 I missed too many. 
 If it's good, Cookie, honey, you can leave right away. 
 Okay. 
 I don't know if Lucious shot or killed Bunkie. 
 (gasps) I really don't. 
 But what I do know is that they were fighting over this radio station. 
 The Apex Radio deal? 
 Yeah, that's the one. 
 Uh, Bunkie was, uh, trying to stop Lucious from purchasing it. 
 And then, Bunkie comes up dead. 
 And Lucious makes a deal for Apex the first week he gets out of prison. 
 Yeah. 
 Ah, this isn't bad, Cookie. 
 We'll start investigating the deal right away. 
 At the very least, we'll tie it up for years. 
 Yeah, well, Lucious is gonna fight you on that, because he really wants this deal to go through. 
 It's as good as dead. 
 Now, was that so hard? 
 No. (chuckles) 
 And your weave is nice, I'm sorry. 
 And so is your wig. 
 Are you sure this is the right spot? 
 Yeah, remember? 
 It's right in front of the tree with the hole. 
 It's our marker. 
 I know, but I just feel like we would've hit it by now. 
 Oh, God, no! 
 Babe, we have a big problem! 
 What? 
 All of these trees have the same hole. 
 It's impossible, Rhonda. 
 Andre! 
 They all have the same hole! 
 Oh, my God! 
 Oh, God. 
 Rhonda, it could be anywhere. 
 Yeah. 
 It could be anywhere! 
 Oh, my God! 
 Look, man, I'm sorry. I... I don't even know what to say. 
 My brother's always had a bad temper. 
 And he's a spoiled brat, but I feel horrible. 
 Don't. Don't feel horrible. 
 It's okay. 
 It's not okay, he ruined your work. 
 No. No, no. No, he-he didn't. 
 He, um... he just... he just changed it. 
 Art is, um, it's-it's fluid, Jamal. 
 It's-it's ephemeral. 
 This is the painting now. 
 This is what it has to say. 
 What, that I should have my throat slit? 
 Yes, it represents the violence and the anger of a... of a racist and homophobic society. 
 It's genius. 
 Yeah, really powerful. 
 Don't dig there, Rhonda. 
 It's right in front of a tree, baby. 
 Andre, we have to stop. 
 We are just not gonna find it. 
 No, it's here, we just have to keep trying. 
 We don't have time to keep trying. 
 The sun is gonna come up in, like, two hours. 
 We're gonna get caught. 
 This is it, Rhonda. 
 It's my last shot at getting back in. 
 I know, baby, I understand. 
 But it's not worth it. 
 We should just fill these holes up and get the hell out of here. 
 There's more to life than Empire. 
 Okay. 
 Okay. 
 Okay, let's go. 
 Big one first. 
 Okay, right. 
 Oh, my God. 
 Get down, get down. 
 Okay, okay. 
 Man : Come on out of there with your hands up. 
 Okay. 
 (crying) 
 Who are you? 
 Lucious : The devil himself, and I want your soul. 
 Dad? 
 (chuckles) 
 What are you doing here? 
 I had Thirsty put a tracking device on your car after our little conversation at Laviticus. 
 Thought this might be what you was talking about. 
 What did you do to your uncle? 
 Rhonda : He was... fighting with Andre, and I hit him over the head with a candlestick, and he just never woke up. 
 You saved my life. 
 Rhonda : Oh, my God. 
 (electronic buzzing) 
 What is that? 
 (buzzing) It's your basic corpse-detection system. 
 And you just have that handy? 
 Only for the holidays. 
 It'll just be a few minutes. 
 Rhonda : Yeah. 
 (buzzing) 
 Wow, you buried him good, huh? 
 Very proud of you. 
 (beeping)

 (coughing) 
 (grunting) 
 Hey, wait, wait, h-hold on. 
 I'm gonna say something. 
 Now?! 
 We never said anything before. 
 Go ahead. 
 I'm so sorry for what we did to you, Uncle Vernon. 
 If I could change what happened, I... I'd change everything. 
 I'd tell you that I love you, and, uh... that I forgive you. 
 I wouldn't be the man I am today if you hadn't looked after me like you did for all those years. 
 I'll miss you forever. 
 God, help me. 
 That was really beautiful, son. 
 Geez. 
 Really. 
 If y'all don't mind, can I have a minute to say good-bye to my friend? 
 Yeah. 
 Go get the shovels. 
 You rot in hell, you snitch. 
 Hey, son. 
 (clears throat) 
 Yes, sir. 
 I'm sorry. 
 It's okay. 
 Welcome back to Empire. 
 Thank you, Pop. 
 Damn. 
 You missed him. 
 They finished a few hours ago. 
 Yeah, I figured that. 
 I'm just glad you called. 
 I spoke to Royale-T. 
 I think we might be closing in on him soon. 
 Yeah, that doesn't really matter, 'cause it's not gonna work out. 
 I spoke to Lucious, and he said he never asked you to steal our masters. 
 Cookie... (scoffs) 
 Lucious is lying. 
 I know. 
 But it's you I don't trust. 
 So the answer is no. 
 Don't show up to my studio again. 
 I want the press release to go out today that the FCC has blocked the Apex Radio deal, okay? 
 Yeah, all right, see you soon. 
 (screaming)
