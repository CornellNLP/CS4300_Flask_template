 My name is Alex Parrish, and I've been framed.  It all started seven months ago  at the FBI Academy. 
 Miranda : I have been running a project with Nimah Amin and her sister, Raina, since you arrived. 
 You've been reinstated with an assignment to the L.A. Field Office. 
 They told me that they weren't quite done with me yet and they bumped me back to NAT. 
 Alex : Whoever framed me, they left that behind. 
 This wire is the key. 
 You follow Agent Booth. He leads you to Parrish. 
 [door bursts open] 
 FBI! FBI! 
 I never thought before I'd save our country, I'd have to save myself. 
 [police radio chatter] 
 [siren wails] 
 All right, listen up! 
 Our suspects are trapped in this six-block grid. 
 No one gets out until we find them. 
 Tonight, we are the hunters, and they are they prey. 
 Block by block, door by door... we will do whatever it takes. 
 [breathing shakily] 
 [weakly] We got to get this bullet out. 
 Aah! 
 First I need to get you off the road. 
 [siren wailing] 
 [both groaning] 
 Okay. Come on. 
 [breathing heavily] 
 [sirens wailing in distance] 
 [grunts] God. You ever perform field surgery before? 
 No, but I feel like I'm about to. 
 Okay. 
 All right. 
 We will find them and bring them to justice. 
 [Ray Lamontagne's "She's the One" plays] 
 Thank you for letting me move in. 
 Alex : No, not at all. 
 They were consolidating rooms after the cuts. 
 I'm just glad you asked me before I got stuck with someone I didn't like. 
 Are you gonna miss living with your sister? 
 I will, but it's time for me to be myself. 
 I'm grateful that the only person I have to match now is me. 
 - Fighting in the West Bank... 
 I'm sorry. I didn't realize that was... Oh, no, no, leave it. I'm interested. ...across the border, only to be met with resistance and violence. Yeah? This is all unfair to you. There have been increased bombings and shootings. I know you, but you don't know me. [ newscaster speaking indistinctly ] You're like a puzzle. Which part of "Franken-Nimah" was actual Nimah and which part was you? You wear a hijab, she doesn't. You are more religious. My beliefs are important for me. ...surrounding neighborhoods... It's something that you and I have in common. ...violence. It's a disaster. You believe in a two-state system, right? For BB3 news in Lancaster, this is Zachary Halpert. That was Nimah. Alex : How'd you pull it off... You know, f-fooling everyone the whole time? ♪ She's the one! ♪ Not everyone... only our fellow trainees. ♪ Oh, she's the one! ♪ Miranda and Liam knew... our campus staff, too. You can sell any lie you want if you have enough help. ♪ I just got to get to know that girl ♪ Hey, uh, you know what story I love? [chuckling] It's, uh, the one where, um, boy was so mean to you, and the day he got circumcised, you kicked him in the... [chuckles] That's also Nimah. ...needs to be met with resistance... Getting eliminated from the surveillance drill so we could... ...increased bombings and shootings. I was in the room, but the whole idea was Nimah's. ♪ I can't even walk down the street ♪ 
♪ Without my feet falling out from under ♪ [both breathing heavily] Mm. ♪ She's the one! ♪ [both laugh] Okay. ♪ Oh, she's the one! ♪ 
♪ She's the one ♪ [door closes] Caleb : Vasquez and Brandon outlasted us. How is that possible? Well, I'm sure they have a lot to go over after what he pulled last week. Their door was still closed, huh? Yeah. I really miss bunkin' with Elias. Unlike Brandon, that dude never got laid. Hey, can I borrow your phone? I left mine in there. And I want to check my FantasyFootball scores. Oh, so we've reached that point in our relationship, huh? Did you just say "relationship"? ♪ I just got to get to know that girl ♪ What's your passcode? It's my birthday. [inhales sharply] What, are you trying to get hacked? You got to change that. Oh, you don't know my birthday. Well, it's not like you know mine. What's my sister's name? What's my middle name? Where did I grow up? What color are my eyes? How old am I? How old are you? Ah! I'm almost 18. Caleb. [giggles] Charlie : So, what is this, bring your kid to work day? Miranda : It was Liam's suggestion. What, to remind me that your job is your highest priority? Well, if that's true, wouldn't you want to see what you come in second to? You'd be surprised... what people do to get into the Bureau. They sell their houses, they quit their jobs, they leave their families, all to be a part of a cause greater than themselves. That's my hope for you, that you have that purpose in the end. You just want to keep your eye on me. Maybe I do... because I like what I see. ♪ ♪ [indistinct conversations] [laughter] So, you're back. What, do you think I went somewhere? Miranda : So, you survived last week's exam. And how's it feel? [cheers and applause] Because today begins the next phase of your training, and that means thinking bigger, specifically about the world outside of Quantico. From now on, you'll be able to leave the campus on nights and weekends. [cheers and applause] Miranda : But it also means... [both laugh] ...thinking about the field you're going to be assigned to when you leave. Once you're out, you're gonna be building cases on your own before you reach out to your superiors. We've been teaming you up, and now we're going to see how you fare solo. Based on your performance so far, we're going to assign each of you a test case that suits you. Good luck. What are you still doing here? I told you you could leave. I'm not going anywhere until I know you're leaving Alex alone. You're not gonna mess with her head the way you messed with mine. This is the first clue of what they think is right for us. "A bomb threat at the CDC in Atlanta"? I guess they want me in Terrorism. "The employee database at the D.C. Parks Department was hacked"? Cyber Crime? Oh, great. I guess all that time stuck behind a computer as an analyst really impressed them. They typed me too... "Cop killed in a hit and run on I-95." I got the kidnapping of a doctor at Mass General. Guess I'll be seeing you in Violent Crime? I got Organized Crime. [chuckles] It's a case involving the Russian mob. Jewelry theft. Wait. We both have the same case. Same case, separate work. Just like our assignment after we graduate. Hey, guys, you know what I just realized? After graduation, we may all never be in the same room again. How weird is that? [indistinct conversations] [telephone rings] Clayton : Leave Wyatt with me. Take them away. I can't believe you're a part of this. You know me. And considering our history, you should trust me. I wouldn't do something like this if I didn't think that it was right. There's so much more to this that you're not seeing. You're so... you're so fixated on Alex, but she's not the one you... When did she turn you? What did she say to you? Or have you always been a part of this and that's why you got close to me? Is that really what you think? Sir. The press is ready for you. I'll deal with her later. [screaming] Shh! Shh! Shh! Not too loud! Okay, okay. Listen to me. Alex : No, please. I can't. Okay. All right. You're fishing for it. You got to just go in there and get it, okay? Yeah. All right? [both breathing heavily] Hold on, hold on. Okay. [breathing shakily] [inhales sharply, screaming] Oh! [shouts] Okay. All right. [panting] Ready? Yeah. Go, go, go! [mutters] Okay. [muffled screaming] Hold on! I think I feel it! I feel it, I feel it, okay? Hold on. Okay, okay. Go. Okay, okay. Oh, I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry. Ow! Aah! You got it? Uh, okay, I got it, I got it. I think I got it. [groaning] Ah! [both breathing heavily] God. Clayton : Good evening. I'm pleased to report that, within the last hour, the FBI has conducted a successful raid on a house in Astoria. Alex Parrish, Grand Central bomber, is trapped within a six-block perimeter as we speak. Man :  Is it true that the co-conspirators are also FBI special agents? Aah! Whew! Make no mistake about it... this is Alex Parrish's last stand. Hey. Man #2 :  Is the bureau taking any steps to prevent... Don't lose hope. ...this type of bomber in the future? Woman :  Care to comment on rumors the President has requested... He's right. ...additional oversight from Homeland Security? Everyone that's helped us. Clayton :  We don't need any additional oversight... Is either in custody or worse. ...now that our suspect is nearly in custody. The suspect is... There's still got to be another way to clear your name. Even if there was, how am I gonna find it before they find us? [ monitor beeps ] [ rapid beeping, whirring ] Excuse me. We must be having some technical... Man :  What's happening? MAN #2: Sir, has the FBI been hacked? [cellphone ringing] Woman :  Are these classified documents? What's going on? Nobody knows. [indistinct shouting, beeping continues] But all the documents are coming from your server. Well, shut it down. They can't. Who else had access to your computer? This is the Bureau's entire Grand Central investigation. Ryan : What, someone leaked it? Who? I don't know. But whoever they are, they just gave me everything I need to clear my name once and for all. [suspenseful music plays] [siren wailing] Two men... [indistinct] [indistinct shouting] There, there! Turn around! Somebody just peered from that dark house. [police radio chatter] [suspenseful music plays] Come on. How'd you get through the checkpoints? We just had to prove we live inside the perimeter. Ryan : Who are they? Alex : Mia and Duncan from The Unknown. Sweep's closing in. We need to get you both out of here. How? I don't know. But it's gonna take more than a ConEd bill. How'd you hack in to the FBI? We guessed their password. There'll be time to look through all that after. What matters now is getting you to safety. No. Somewhere in there is proof that I'm innocent, proof they might not even know they have. Mia, you know how to look through this stuff. Just... just help me until we have to go. CNN has 10 experts combing through every E-mail I've ever sent. MSNBC knows Miranda helped Alex escape, and they're having a field day with it. And Fox News is saying I'm the one behind the leaks. Huh. So I guess it's only a matter of time before they find out about you and Agent Wyatt. Do you think she did it? [sighs] I think it's an awful coincidence that this happened an hour after she was taken into custody. And after 20 years in the FBI, I don't believe in coincidences. But if it's not her, if it's someone else, then they may be going to private E-mails next. And that's where I communicated with Shelby. I was hoping you could scrub my account of anything sensitive. No, no, no, no. You do your own dirty laundry. In case you haven't noticed, I'm running a citywide manhunt at the moment. You're the only person I can trust to protect me... and your mother. If it's true the nomination's coming in a few days, I don't want to put her career at any unnecessary risk because I... Because you thought that you were in love with Shelby? Well, guess what. So did I... until she got what she wanted and she tossed me aside, too. Look, I'll scrub your E-mail. But you can't un-send something. It's gonna catch up to you at some point. Not if you delete hers, too. You thought I was gone for good, huh? Listen, I just went to visit a senior agent at one of my old field offices to see if he could help out. He gave me this. Your father was O'Connor's boss when he graduated. They worked together until '93, when O'Connor put in for an immediate transfer request. Nobody knows why. The only thing I can think of is maybe your mom might have an idea she could tell you or something. I don't know. Yeah, well, she's had 15 years to come clean. Whatever she knows, she's not telling. We have to find out. We need to do it on our own. Our  own? [indistinct conversations] $5 million in diamonds goes missing two years ago, and half of them show up on the black market for sale last month in Brighton Beach. Brighton beach, that's where my mobsters are. Wait, are these cases connected? Miranda said we each got our own. Let me see what everyone else has. Shelby's a part of your case? No, Brandon. I just need to be prepared next time she makes me feel bad for not knowing where she went to college. Well, something that my dad says when he digs up dirt on other politicians... "You find what you're looking for." I'd just be careful, man. I'm just looking for details. Well, your mom's a Democratic senator. Her dad basically ran Blackwater. I mean, their companies have their hands in things that you don't want to know about. I'm telling you, man, you're like one click away from permanent E.D. What is the attraction between you two? Daddy issues? Master race? You know nothing about him and me. I know you're moving fast, and that never ends well. Last time I moved fast, once I got to know the guy, what I found out, I wouldn't wish that on anyone. Well, Caleb doesn't have secrets. [cellphone ringing] Oh. Uh, sorry. I forgot to give it back. Are you spying on me? [chuckles] [ringing continues] Uh, must be a misdial. Hmm? Yeah, changed it to my birthday. [all talking over one another] You can't work your cases alone? Not if the cases are connected. Yeah, they all seem to form a path to D.C. [raps desk] Liam : There's no such thing as a solo assignment. There's always a bigger picture. And oftentimes, another agent or investigation can help you crack your own. You just have to connect the dots. Each of you holds a piece of the puzzle. Your job will be to fit them together. You're going to present that bigger picture at headquarters this afternoon. You're making your first trip to the Bureau. Welcome to 935 Pennsylvania Avenue. Also known as FBI headquarters. Today you will be briefing some of the Bureau's highest-ranking special agents. I urge you to impress them. They may play a crucial role in your future. Nimah and Simon, since you found out that the assignments are related, you'll lead the briefing. The briefing starts at 2:00. In the meantime, look around at your future in case you make it here. I can't believe he's lied to my face about knowing my father this whole time. Oh, I can. Well, we can't exactly go up to him and ask him, can we? We don't have to. If there are real answers to be found, they're right here in this building. This place? It's Fort Knox. Well, you know, I guess it's a good thing that I'm not a trainee. I think we should end the briefing with a joke... you know, go out on a high. I'm gonna give them facts, and that's it. I don't seek their approval. It's not about approval. It's about, you know, standing out to make sure they hear. Like lying about your sexuality to differentiate yourself. I prefer being honest and straightforward. Pardon the expression. Hmm? I'm sorry, you haven't been honest this whole time. That wasn't my choice. I wanted to be here, but they wouldn't let me without Raina. Well, from where I'm standing, you're doing just fine on your own. [cellphone ringing] It's that same telemarketer. I thought you said it was a misdial? Yeah, well, they left a message. A telemarketer left a message? This picture was taken in Nebraska. Look. Maybe we should start there. Yeah, I think that's a great idea. "Houston, Vegas... Omaha." '93... that's two truck bombs, one FBI field office... 200 dead. [suspenseful music plays] Ryan, why's my mother's name on this file? Let me see. She was interviewed as a person of interest and then released. The FBI questioned her about her history with the ISI. My mother has nothing to do with the Pakistani intelligence. "Where in Bombay did you meet Michael Parrish?" What the hell is going on? I don't know. We got to go. We got five minutes till the briefing. So put that in your bag, and let's go. Alex : All our cases were connected. Here's what we found. The bomb threat at the CDC was a distraction so someone could steal the virus. And the doctor kidnapped at Mass General was an immunologist. And the Russian mob was hired to do this on behalf of separatists in Moscow. Raina : And they used stolen diamonds to pay a courier to transport the virus. The courier killed the cop that caught on to him and made it look like a hit-and-run. And the last place that he was spotted was D.C. And we all think it points to a biological attack on a D.C. park. Why a park? Low security, high foot traffic. You maximize casualties. Congratulations on a successful briefing. You made your case. Yes, well done. But there is one thing you don't know. This is based on a real-life scenario. We stopped it. Can you? Just like the FBI did, you have to find the suspect and retrieve the chemical weapon before it goes off. You'll be stationed at Marshall Park down the street. If you see any of these suspects, you have to pursue them and retrieve the target, a specially weaponized strain of Ebola, without causing panic and without getting made. Because if they see you coming, we're all dead. [metal clinks] Do I get to watch this? If you want to, yes. Yeah. Uh, Raina. Only one of you can be outside of the building. Your sister and Simon seem to be working well together. Why don't you sit this one out? Mia : At least there's one bright spot. The leak really did reveal everything the FBI has on the bombing... forensics, field reports, interviews. It's all here. Wait. Go back. [man speaking indistinctly on TV] Guys, I think I found something. These are credit-card receipts in my name. The bomber bought... "Insulation, reflective paint, noncorrosive drain cleaner." Yeah, but that doesn't make any sense. None of those components were found in the Grand Central bomb. Well, maybe they needed them for a dry run. [sighs] Alex. What's wrong? What if Grand Central  was  the dry run? [suspenseful music plays] There's another bomb out there. Duncan : Explain to me exactly what I'm looking at. Okay. I found that wire in the apartment next to mine, where the bomb was really built. What's so special about it? Simon told me it's a lead wire, and... and according to all the preliminary forensics, the only wiring that was used in the bomb was blasting wire. So the bomber used the lead wire in the second device. Well, they used it for something. [sirens wailing in distance] You have to admit that, if the terrorist has this kind of wire and those materials, another bomb isn't just some idea... it's an inevitability. If you pieced this all together in 10 minutes, so will the FBI. Yeah, the problem is the FBI doesn't have this wire. And without it, they won't know what they're looking for. Hey, I think I just found something. The person behind the leak? No, bigger. This is an E-mail that your assistant Tracy sent to you the night before the bombing. I-I remember. It's not any help to us. What? Are... are... are you... are you kidding? This is huge. L-Look at this. "Sorry to disturb you on your night off, but Agent Goodwin just called. Another agent used Alex Parrish's badge to gain entry into the New York Field Office tonight. Goodwin asks that you call her back." So, w-why would anybody else be using Parrish's badge? I don't know. Maybe you should ask one of her accomplices. You don't know that they're accomplices. We've got a whole roomful of them downstairs. We have a whole roomful of people that are trying to help exonerate Alex. You don't know that they were in it from the beginning... unless you know something that I don't. Did you call Goodwin that night? Well, she sent me an E-mail telling me it was a glitch in the system. You can search through it and read it for yourself. Huh. I just thought, after 20 years in the FBI, you didn't believe in coincidences? Yeah, I'll call Goodwin now. ♪ I've never been in love before ♪ Liam : Remember, you're on the lookout for one of 10 possible suspects we showed you... ♪ I've never been in love before ♪ .. in the photographs. Keep your eyes open. Alex : This exercise is the only thing keeping the words... "your mother might be Pakistani intelligence" .. out of my head. I don't think that's what the file will say. I don't know, Ryan. Nobody I know seems to be who they say they are. Why would my mom be different? Unless you're using an app to track airborne contagions, you should put the phone away. No, I'm staring at my phone so I don't look like a stalker. You're being weird. No leering, no snarky comments, no trying to take me behind that tree. I'll grope you on the bus ride home. Well, good. I could use something to look forward to. Ms. Wyatt. We need you to join us back at H.Q. We have a few questions. Is this part of the exercise? If you'd just come with us. Man : Haas, you, too. Sit on that bench and take a look at the file. If I see anyone that looks like a terrorist, I promise I'll let you tackle 'em. Two minutes, okay? [indistinct conversations] Okay, everybody stay together. If you have all of your stuff, we're gonna head over to the National... Hey, does anyone have eyes on the guy with the tweed blazer? I think he's one of the suspects they showed us. Oh, you do? Okay. Yeah. Okay. I can't see him, I can't see him. Uh, I think I can help. I got a plan. Booth. Yeah? Start walking towards me. Just follow my lead. All right. 
 
 [suspenseful music plays] Aah! Go... watch. Watch where you're going, buddy. What's wrong with you? Really, Waldo? You only got eyes in front of your head. What'd you call me? [all arguing indistinctly] It's him. It's him! [suspenseful music plays] Woman : Stay close, honey! Oh! Watch it! Hey! [grunts] Hey, look out! Come over here. Come over here. Hey! Whoa! Ow! [indistinct shouting] [grunting] [grunts] [laughter] [both breathing heavily] I got him. [indistinct conversations] [footsteps approach] Hey, Tracy. My dad wanted me to take a look at your personal E-mail, specifically anything that you sent to him. It's okay. He already talked to me about it. Deleting the one about Agent Goodwin? Great. Thank you. [suspenseful music plays] Alex, we have to focus on getting you out of here. Then we can call an anonymous tip about the bomb. The Bureau's getting thousands of tips a day. They're just gonna add this one to the list. Not if we say it's coming from you. [sighs] If you think getting out's gonna be hard now, you wait until you give 'em your cellphone to trace. Our phones are untraceable. We can call on the way. Okay, even if I wanted to go, we don't have a way. Well, it's too late now. They found us. No, they haven't. That's our ride. [police radio chatter] How is that our ride? The leak included the VIN numbers of every FBI vehicle assigned to the New York Field Office. I used the list, hacked into one of their cars a couple blocks away, drove it over here. How the hell'd you do that? The dashboard computer, it's wired to the Internet. [groans] Listen, grab your stuff. We got to be at the airport in half an hour. The airport? We're not just getting you out of the neighborhood. We're getting you out of the country. I can't leave the country. There's still another bomb out there. You'll never find it like this... on the run, wondering where you're gonna sleep or eat. Alex. [breathing heavily] You can't keep going on like this. And you don't have to. We're offering you a chance to be a part of our global network, to be free. Being free isn't the same as having your freedom. It doesn't matter where I'll go. The government won't stop hunting me. If you stay, there's only one way this ends. [sighs] [indistinct conversations] [telephone ringing] Get out. [door closes] Get out! Hey. Keep your voice down. You deleted the E-mail about Alex? You just broke about a dozen different federal laws... obstruction of justice, for starters. I did what was necessary. I eliminated... No, you eliminated the only piece of evidence that was there to exonerate Alex. And luckily for her, I kept a copy. [thud] How are you still so naive? You think this is about Alex? Read the E-mail again. Why do you think Tracy apologized for disturbing me? Because she knew I was in the hotel with Shelby. That's where I opened up the E-mail, on the hotel Wi-Fi. So you're worried about the I.P. address on the read receipt. Because if it gets entered into evidence, it's only gonna be a matter of time before they place Shelby and I together. [sighs] There's no cover-up, Caleb. I'm just trying to protect your mom from any unnecessary pain. So unless you have any other accusations, I suggest you get back to scrubbing Shelby's phone. I'm sorry, but what is going on? Did we do something wrong? Not if you can explain why you've sent thousands of dollars a month to a bank in the Middle East... bank with ties to terrorism. I, uh... Until last month, that is, when you sent a million dollars. Don't say another word, Shelby. Who gave you permission to interrogate my trainees? We're dong our job, Miranda. Mnh-mnh. Doing your job would've been asking me first because, if you had, I would've told you that the name on the account is Samar Hashmi. It's my half-sister. Did you really think that you would know something about my trainees that I didn't? I thought you said you never spoke to your half-sister. I lied 'cause it was no one's business but mine. My father used travel to Saudi Arabia for work. He met a woman there, then they had a daughter, and then he left her for my mother. For two decades, he hid Samar from me, my mother, everyone. But then after my parents died, she reached out. She was desperate, so, yes, every month, I help her out. Last month, she asked for a deposit on the house, and I gave that to her, as well. The million dollars? It was the least I could do after everything she's been through. If you have any more questions, I'm sure Ms. Wyatt will give you the name of her lawyer. Shelby. I'm sorry. I have no idea how or why that happened. I do. You did this? Look, Shelby, I-I knew you were lying to me, and I knew it, and I-I just asked a friend to check that number that... That's... Shelby. Well, I caught him, but there's nothing in his bag, [air hissing] so what's going on? Aah! What?! Oh! Come on, Alex. You know there's always a twist. While he was the suspect... you were the terrorist. But I've had that bag on me since the moment we left Quantico. Yeah, well, while you were running around the park looking for a suspect you thought you knew, one you didn't slipped it into your bag. He was the decoy meant to lead you to FBI headquarters, knowing he'd need you to get in. And I was so focused on following him I didn't realize I was a part of his plan. Bigger picture... it's not always something you can see. And today none of you saw it. [indistinct conversations] The file, it's gone. That was kind of cool today. Yeah, you think so? Yeah. They actually have fun learning all that stuff... running around, [chuckling] helping each other. I try to make it fun. 'Cause when they leave here, it's real. And real isn't always fun. Still, those are the people who are protecting us? [both chuckle] Yes. And every one of them would die for you. Do you think I could ever be an agent? [dramatic music plays] You know what? Forget it. There... there are background checks. Um, our agents have to have clean records. You know what? I was just kidding. D-Don't even... Honey, there are other things that you could do with your life. Yeah, like what? [knock on door] Come in. Hey. Uh... Wanted to see if you wanted to maybe go for a drink. [door closes] First night away from campus. [chuckles] Uh, unless you don't drink. That's my sister. Right. Keep getting it wrong. [chuckles] You know, Raina lives down the hall, where she's always been. She's the one you should be talking to, not me. She likes you. But you surprise me. I'm not interested in surprising you... or doing anything else with you, Simon. I'm here for myself. Whatever you may like about me, maybe you can find it in her. But please leave me alone. [dramatic music plays] Where's the file? Back where it belongs. You have no right to... I have every right. Can you even hear yourself anymore? You stole classified documents from a federal building. The week before, you planted surveillance equipment in my office. Do you have any idea how much trouble you'd be in if I told anyone? Tell 'em. Tell the entire world for all I care. You're still lying to me. You're still manipulating me. When does it stop, Liam? I am not scared of you anymore, and I will do whatever it takes to find out the truth about my father, and there's nothing you can say that'll stop me. What happened in Omaha? Alex. Who was behind the bombing, Liam? That's enough. 204 people died that day. And you don't think I know that? Whose fault was it, Liam?! It was mine! [sighs] It was my fault. Mine and your father and a dozen other agents. [sighs] Your father, Michael, and I had gone undercover with a local militia group. We knew they were planning something, but... we missed the signs. So you covered it up. Oh, your father, he couldn't forgive himself. He couldn't live with it. And my mother... was she involved? Was she ISI? No, the... the FBI was looking for anyone to blame, anything. And you let them. We'd given our entire lives to the FBI. We couldn't survive without it. There was nothing we could do to bring those people back, so we buried the evidence. [sighs] Evidence that would destroy your career. Not just mine. People who've risen here... who've become some of the top-ranking agents... great agents, great people... who've spent their whole career trying to make up for what they did. If you don't believe me, ask Miranda. Now all I can do is beg you. Let it go. Let it go, or... [sighs] turn me in. [Brandi Carlile's "I Belong to You" plays] It looks like they're at it again. Unh-unh. You are not allowed in this room anymore. Shelby, I'm sorry. Apology not accepted. Mnh-mnh. You know what? I'm actually... I'm actually glad you asked to borrow my phone this morning because now I've seen the real you, and you are not who I thought you were. Okay, please stop. Just listen to me. There's nothing else to say. ♪ Last night, I had the exact dream as you ♪ Okay, Shelby, look, I-I violated your trust... ♪ I killed a bird to save your life ♪ .. and I just want to give you the opportunity to violate mine. ♪ And you gave me your shoes ♪ Caleb, you are not hearing me. ♪ You said, "Clip my wings and walk my miles" ♪ We're done violating each other. ♪ And I said I would, too ♪ When my father said that he saved my life, this is what he meant. ♪ Then I woke up ♪ When I was 17, I was part of an organization. ♪ But I wasn't gonna tell you ♪ Organization? What, like a cult? Well, they made sure legally nobody could use that word but... ♪ Today I sang the same damn tune as you ♪ ...that is what my dad called it. ♪ It was "Lady in Red" ♪ 
♪ I hate that song and I know you do, too ♪ One night, him and a-a bunch of agents... ♪ You didn't catch me singing along ♪ .. they stormed in... ♪ But I always sing with you ♪ .. and they rescued me. Rescued you from what? ♪ Nice and quietly 'cause I don't want to stop you ♪ From the things that they would do to you in there. ♪ I know I could be spending ♪ They would tell you that they would make everything better, that they accepted you in ways that your... ♪ A little too much time with you ♪ .. your family wouldn't. ♪ But time and too much don't belong ♪ And... and you believe it because you need to believe it. ♪ Together like we do ♪ And they hold on to you. They hold on to you, and you don't let go. They hold on to you so... so tight that you can't breathe, and... ♪ If I had all my yesterdays ♪ .. and then there's only one way out. ♪ I'd give 'em to you, too ♪ You could've told me. ♪ I belong to you now ♪ Nobody knows, Shelby. ♪ I belong to you ♪ My... my dad scrubbed it from my record because that's my secret, just like your sister's your secret, and nobody knows about your sister. ♪ I see the world the exact same way that you do ♪ You keep her a secret 'cause you care about her, and you want to protect her. ♪ We lend our hands and take our stands ♪ 
♪ In tandem when we do ♪ I don't tell anybody my secret 'cause I'm so ashamed. ♪ When I lied and said I knew the way ♪ 
♪ I hid my eyes from you ♪ I'm so ashamed that, the last time that somebody cared about me... ♪ I still don't know why ♪ .. the way that you care about me... ♪ I probably didn't want to scare you ♪ .. that they were lying to get what they wanted. ♪ I know I could be spending ♪ See, I... ♪ Too much time with you ♪ [chuckles] I never really believed that somebody could like me for... for me. ♪ But time and too much don't belong together like we do ♪ Caleb. ♪ If I had all my yesterdays ♪ Caleb. ♪ I'd give 'em to you, too ♪ I don't just like you. [sighs] ♪ I belong to you ♪ 
♪ I belong to you ♪ [both sigh] [indistinct conversations] Hey. Are you okay? No. Actually, it's not a lot of fun reading about how your ex fell in love with your dad, especially when they bond over how concerned they are about you. What are you doing with my phone? My dad didn't tell you that he's got me deleting E-mails... his and yours? What are you talking about? He's distancing himself from you. And he's lying to me about why he's doing it. But I know it's because he never really cared about you. He only cares about saving his own ass. Your dad might think what I did was wrong. That doesn't make him a bad person. He takes his job seriously, and it takes a lot of character to hurt someone you love in order to do what's right. Clay has that character. You have no idea what he's capable of. I had no idea what  you  were capable of. Look where we are now. [dramatic music plays] [car door closes] Here we go! [groans] Thank you. I'll make sure everything's ready! Yeah, okay. Come on. Okay. You're okay, you're okay. You ever thought the first time we flew together we'd end up like this? How could I ever forget? Going to Quantico was the hardest thing I've ever done. You were just trying to find out the truth about your dad. And I did. He made one mistake, and he regretted it for the rest of his life. I left your meds in the car, okay? I'll just get them. All right. Okay. Where's she going? Where's she going?! [suspenseful music plays] Oh, finally allowed off campus at night, you know what that means. The globe and eagle. FBI, DEA, and Marines all gathered in one place, aided by copious amounts of alcohol. Count me in. Me too. Around 10:00? Yeah. You in, Raina? Raina doesn't drink, but if you want to go with her, I can stay here tonight. We just cannot be seen in public at the same time. That's right. Um, next time? Yeah. Next time. [indistinct conversations] Hey, uh, I could make us some tea here. Thank you. But, no. Raina, did I do something wrong? No. I did. We didn't accept you into the Academy because of who you are. We accepted you because of who you could become. You might not see where you're going, but we do. So he was telling the truth. Yes, he was. So, what are you gonna do? Aren't you upset that Liam told me? Why would I be? That's his story. Were you a part of it? Not at that time. Another chapter maybe. And the others? The higher-ups? Good people... who've all done great things. How do you live with something like that inside you? [cellphone ringing, vibrating] I have to take this. Excuse me. ♪ Walk through the field ♪ Yeah, sure. Miranda : We have a perspective that you don't have. ♪ Sat in a tree ♪ Hello. You must be Mark. Raymond. Yes. ♪ I love you ♪ Ooh! I'm nervous. Oh, don't be. Be excited. Prepare for the most transformative two hours of your life. Your assessment is waiting for you. ♪ Pick up a gun ♪ [speaking Arabic] ♪ Shoot the TV ♪ _ _ ♪ Never want to see your face again ♪ [laughs] Sally : Miranda, this is Sally from next door. I think I just saw somebody on your roof. Miranda? [glass shatters] Miranda : My goal for each one of you is that you see the world with a new point of view, a point of view that we don't have. The tough part is figuring out how they all fit together. ♪ Never want to see your face again ♪ [cellphone vibrating] On 9/11, the FBI and the CIA had all the pieces they needed, but they couldn't connect them. [speaking Hebrew] [speaking Hebrew] And we see the world differently now. And we will stop it the next time... Alex : Miranda? ...all of us working together. You coming back? [thud] [breathing shakily] Miranda! Miranda! [gasps] What happened? [weakly] Charlie... [glass shatters] [suspenseful music plays] Duncan : Are you sure about this? I'm positive. I hope you know what you're doing. [door opens] [indistinct conversations] Miranda : And the reason that we accepted all of you... Man : It's her! Hands where I can see them! Miranda : ...is because we knew you would. Man : Stay where you are! It's Parrish! [grunts, panting] There's another bomb hidden somewhere in New York City. I can't tell you where it is, but if you don't find it fast, it's all over. ♪ ♪
