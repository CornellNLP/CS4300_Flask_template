 My name is Alex Parrish. Protecting our country had always been my dream, but my life took a turn. It all started nine months ago on my way to the FBI Academy. 
 My father was a special agent. 
 My mother didn't shoot him.  I  did. 
 Alex : You think one of these people is a terrorist? 
 We're pretty sure they already were a terrorist when they got to Quantico. 
 I never thought before I'd save our country, I'd have to save myself. 
 No one's gonna believe you're the same person unless you match. 
 Maybe we should have never come here. 
 This is the only piece of evidence that's real. 
 Agent Asher. 
 I need to find the truth. 
 Michael : She's my daughter! 
 Sita : Get out! 
 No! 
 Tell her the truth! 
 For once, Sita! 
 The truth about you? 
 Aah!

 Excellent work, Parrish. 
 You have a perfect target. 
 Check out Alex's target. 
 It's what you should all be aiming for. 
 Next team. 
 Someone's been on their game lately. 
 And here I thought it would come down to me and you for Top Gun. 
 She's like the Terminator. 
 When we're not in class, she's at the library, the pool, the gym. 
 She doesn't stop. 
 Maybe she's a blue flamer. 
 That's what they call NATs who start raring to go but crash and burn before the finish line. 
 No, that's not Alex. 
 At least I don't think it is. 
 Newscaster :  It's been 24 hours since the Grand Central bombing and the whereabouts of the prime suspect, Alex Parrish, an FBI special agent, are still not known. 
 Just released a picture of Parrish. 
 They hope this photo will help track her down. Wouldn't shoot a man with a cherry scone, would you? I'm so sorry. I'm... I'm just on edge. Guess you don't need the coffee. Wow. You've been busy. So, I tracked down all the information I could on all the NATs in our class. Simon : That couldn't have been easy. Did you know Paul Winters spent time in Iran? And Graham Nelson married a woman whose brother was a Chechnyan rebel. And Elias... you know how many FBI persons of interest he's defended in his law career? And got most of them acquitted. You didn't get much sleep, did you? What we really need is to find a bomb technician to take a look at this wire, Simon. It's the only thing I have pointing to... whoever's framed me. I might know a guy. Former IDF, now lives in Williamsburg. Y-You think he could figure out where this came from? I... [cellphone ringing] Uh, it's work. Let me, um... [ringing continues] [cellphone beeps] Clayton : We're sending in ESU and Hostage-Rescue Teams. Keep her there. Just... D-Don't you think that's a little hasty? Ju... She trusts me, all right? I can get information from her. Just... just give me time. They're already en route. You'll get a heads-up when they're 60 seconds out. Do you copy? Copy that. Trainee Amin. I've noticed it's just been you the last few days. Is your sister okay? Nimah has the flu. I've been doing double shifts. I'm sorry to hear that. I'll check in on her after... Oh, no, it's fine. She's much better now. Amin. If the stress is getting to her, you can tell me, okay? NATs get homesick after the first four weeks. It interferes with their training. Not to mention the stress of you two trying to pass as one person. Don't worry about her. This is what she always wanted, remember? Hey, Booth. Good news. You're going home. I'm what? Your mission, it's over. You don't seem relieved. Well, maybe 'cause I haven't heard the catch. Alex Parrish has been flagged as an unfit candidate for the FBI. I don't need your eyes on her anymore. Just need you to get her to quit the Academy. Quit? Why? A good soldier knows how to follow orders, not question them. I was told to make this happen. Now I'm telling you. Alex is at the top of her class. She's as determined now as she's ever been. The only way you're getting her out of Quantico is if you kick her out. It's in our best interest that you help her make that decision herself. And how am I supposed to do that? You saw her with that file. Trust me, she's more fragile than you think. Just give her a push. Ray : Hostage Rescue is, at its essence, a mind game. Operators need to feel comfortable amidst violent confrontation. They need to be able to storm into the chaos of crisis and make clear and calm decisions. Now, ultimately, you will all find yourselves at the same moment in your careers where a split-second decision can save people's lives. Sometimes you have to make that difficult decision for the greater good. This week... we're giving you a taste of what it's like to serve on the FBI's most elite squad. We're gonna put you in high-stress situations to see if you can overcome your wiring and make the right split-second decision. We don't want to see what you do on your best day. We want to see what you do on your worst. Because when the stakes are this high... one moment can change everything. Let's see who you are when it's do or die. Will you freeze, or will you fire? Vasquez : Save America Militia, Sovereign Citizen, Syria, and Iraq-based Islamic State... all claiming credit. Anyone  not  taking credit at this point? [Sighs] Yeah. Parrish. Wonder why? You don't think she did it? I'm just asking questions. She put a bullet in you and left you for dead. Maybe she thought I was the one framing her. I know. It's crazy, but... No, it's just sad. Don't make this into something. If I was gonna make this into something, I would ask what you were doing at her apartment at 6:00 in the morning. I was clearing the air. I hadn't talked to her since she found out about us. It was a mistake. I should have told you. I'm sorry. Liam : There's been a break. EAD's got a lock on Alex's position. He's sending in a team to grab her right now. [cellphone vibrates] [Alex sighs] There's no point of waiting for your friend to call. He doesn't like surprises. Well, I can't just sit here, Simon. And you can't just rush into danger, either. Look, I'm putting my neck on the line here. We don't move till we hear back. All right. Go, go, go. Proceed with caution. Move. East entrance. Seal the perimeter. [cellphone vibrates] Is it him? It's, uh... [cellphone vibrates] Simon? You sure we've got her? Positive. I've got someone on the inside. [cellphone vibrating] Alex : Simon! What's happening? Close in. ♪ It's Oren. Uh, he says he can meet us, but we got to move right now. Let's go. Come on, let's go! Okay. My team checked the entire area and they are gone. Check credit cards, cellphones, car. I need eyes on Agent Asher now! Let's go! O'Connor! You got a leak in your unit. Somebody tipped her off we were coming. My unit? How about your unit? How long has Simon Asher been working with the FBI? He left Quantico in disgrace, and now you're trusting him to bring in public enemy number one? When he started working for a company that we were investigating, I took the liberty of instating him. He's been undercover for months. And if it weren't for him, we wouldn't even know where Alex was right now. She's turned him, Clay. You don't know that. And for the record, I don't feel the need to be lectured by the man who trained the woman we're all chasing. Liam : Welcome to Hogan's Alley, the FBI's very own small-town U.S.A. There's a playground, supermarket, banks. You can grab a bite to eat at the diner, or you can go to work at the office complex. And it's all staffed up, just like it would be in the real world. Over the next few weeks, you will be working through multiple realistic stressful scenarios here with your analysts offering insight and support into how to continually improve your performance. Three key principles Look at us. of a successful raid... Partners at last. You intimidated? I spent months with the UAWC rehabbing greenhouses bombed by the Israelis in the Gaza Strip. Takes a lot to spook me. Maybe me being in your ear will finally give me a chance to get inside your head. I don't know whether to say good luck or I'm sorry. Ray : We're going to be handing out simulation weapons for your use today. You are to treat these weapons as if they're real. One shot, one kill. Don't look at what people look like. Looks can be deceiving. Look at what they do. I heard HRT seeks out candidates at academy level in hopes they'll be ready down the road. Expect the unexpected. They've never had a woman on the team. Be prepared for anything. I think Shelby's got it in the bag. This ain't shooting skeet at the country club. It's the real deal. And I've got the battle scars to prove I'm up for it. No scars on me. Guess that means I'm more qualified. Wow. I feel like a boss with this thing. Wait. My life is in  your  hands? Calm down, Blake Lively. I'll make sure you don't chip your French tips. [laughs] You are lucky you're an analyst, because you have friendly fire written all over you. Ryan : Hey, you were hoping for real bullets? It's just a game.

♪ Na na na-na-na na na na ♪ I hate guns. Always have. Well, for what it's worth, you were anxious and unfocused. You need to be more alert. Why should I listen to you? You don't want to even be an analyst. Doesn't mean I'm not good at it. Haven't you ever been good at something that you didn't want to do? Incredible. It was like "Call of Duty: CPA." Yeah, well, a lot of snipers are former CPAs. Yeah, but how many cpas are former snipers? Look, I-I'm sure that the constant cross-examination made you very popular as a child, but... I have nothing to hide. Good. Then I have nothing to find when the UAWC E-mails me back. Would you just lay off of me? But I'm not even on you yet. What was that back there? We usually work well together. I was leading. You were supposed to keep up. There's a difference between a leader and a lone gunman. I won it for us, didn't I? You don't win training, Alex. You're there to learn. What is going on? You're not yourself. Psychological profiling was last week, Shelby. You're running from something. I can tell. You know, in my experience, the further you run, the faster it catches up to you. You can talk to me, you know. Well, you can talk to me, too. But you still haven't told me who you were on the phone with late at night or who you E-mail first thing in the morning, you know, when you think no one's looking. It's okay. You don't have to tell me. We've only known each other a month. We barely know each other at all. What was really in that file? [tires squeal] See that office building there? Well, that's the scene of a robbery turned hostage crisis... the test of what you guys learned today. You guys are going in. We'll see who makes it out alive. Just give her a little push. She'll go over the edge. ♪ Ray : In the scenario you're about to enter, it is hour six of an armed robbery turned hostage crisis. There are 8 robbers and 12 hostages inside. All attempts at negotiations have failed. Your mission... conduct a raid using the skills you've learned today. Something's up with Alex. She seems okay to me. A little aggro, maybe, but 10 pounds of ammo weighing you down will bring the Rambo out in anyone. Keep your eyes open. Don't take anything for granted. And remember... Has she talked to you about her father, about what happened? She told you? Yeah, she's been obsessed. I just wish there was something I could do to help. Look, I know you're a good shooter, but it's a whole different story when you pull the trigger on an actual person, much less your father. Wait, you're saying that  she  shot her dad? You said she told you. About the file. Each of you will be assigned a specific task. Simon and Nimah, go in through the back. Alex and Ryan, breach the front door. That's the hardest job. You sure you're up for it? Are you gonna carry your weight, or do I have to drag you with me? [gunshots] [indistinct shouting] Shelby and Natalie, take out that sniper. That's priority number-one since no one can enter that building until he is neutralized. Let's go, blondie. We're wasting time. Watch her. I'm worried. So, what else should I know about your bomb-maker friend? Well, first thing, don't call him bomb-maker. And he's definitely not my friend. Then how do you know him? Look, just make sure you don't look him in the eye. Don't shake his hand. I'm supposed to talk to him without looking him in the eye? Look, I'll do the talking. He doesn't speak English. They're staring at me. These kids have never seen a TV or a computer. They're staring at both of us. We're strangers. 
 
 [conversing in Hebrew] He's asking if we're together. He likes to give me a hard time. He says that he can trace it to a contractor for the military. McGregor-Wyatt. Shelby's company. Okay. How many properties do you think Shelby has? I mean, I know her family company's in aeronautics, but... That's not all they do. They're like Halliburton. And who do you think is head of the board? What exactly are we looking for? Anything that points to Shelby's involvement. If she believes she successfully framed me, then she doesn't think anyone's coming after her. She's planning to run? No, she just returned from Buenos Aires. Maybe she bought herself an alibi. It's pretty hard to screw with flight manifests these days. Look, I mean, this is Shelby we're talking about here. I mean, yeah, maybe her parents are war profiteers, but do you really think she's capable of this? Look, there's a lot you don't know about her. Things I found out  after  you left Quantico. You didn't see what happened after I told her what I knew. Keep looking. I'm sure there's something here. [gunfire] Right wind. Hold one left. Vasquez : I missed! Ah! Liam : Sniper down. Parrish, Booth. Get into position. Hello, Nimah. How did you find me? I teach the people who find people. You think I couldn't find you? I never should have said yes when you recruited me. Obviously you don't want to quit or you'd be in Dearborn already. So, what is this? A pep talk? Go ahead. Say what you want. I am not good enough. You don't know that. Of course I do. If I was good enough, I'd be enough, but you wanted her, too. Mnh. I  need  her, too. Both of you. Equally. For what? If we're so important for you, why can't you tell us why? Invite me inside. Elias : The hostages are being held on the third floor. There's a stairwell to your left. Let's take the elevator. You might as well text them we're coming. Woman : Go left. Go left. Well, maybe what we need is a good diversion. What, you don't trust me? Come on. ♪ Amin, what are you doing? I don't know. I'm thinking. Although I know I'm not supposed to. I got your back. How about you let me do the thinking so you can focus on what's in front of you? You're gonna do the thinking? [breathing heavily] I won't make it five feet. Get your ass inside so I can prove how good I am at this. [elevator bell dings] Alex, clear. Alex : Clear. [gunfire] Ryan : Around the corner. Clear. Man : Aah! I'm hit! Pinned down! Does anyone have a shot? 2:00. Woman : There's more than we can take. We need support. Man #2 : Two perps still at the end of the hall. Man #3 : They took out the whole team. What are you doing? I got this. [grunts] All right, let's go. ♪ [breathing heavily] Is it clear? What are you gonna do, Tarantino your way down the hall, guns a-blazin'? Just tell me when it's clear. I'm gonna end this. Send her out, Booth. She wants to be reckless, teach her a lesson. She needs to get hit. [hostage whimpering] Help! Please, someone help me! It's clear. Okay. Help! Shut up! Don't move! [indistinct arguing] [exhales deeply] Don't lie to her! Get out! [heartbeat] Simon : She stays in hotels a lot. Why would she do that when she's got this place? [car alarm chirps] What was that? Just an S.U.V. [keys rattle, door opens] ♪ It's nice to see you again, Alex. Good to see you, too, Shelby. You could have waited till I got home. I would have let you in. Let's just say I wanted to surprise you. Oh, I think you've surprised enough people the past two days. Well, except for your mother. She saw it coming, didn't she? Watch it. You were supposed to keep her at your place until we could get there. Excuse me? Oh, she doesn't know? I thought that you were good at reading people. Clearly when you read Simon, you missed three very important letters. You're FBI? You lied to me this whole time? Look, if I thought you were guilty, you'd be in custody right now. I got you out of there. Wait, you are helping her? She is a terrorist! I didn't do it, Shelby. But maybe you did, huh? Your whole world fell to pieces when I found out the truth about your parents. I never meant to hurt you. I told you that, and you wouldn't listen to me. So you think that I would blow up Grand Central to get back at you? That is insane, and it's impossible because I've been out of the country. You could have had an accomplice. You could have rigged the bomb to blow remotely. The  bombs ... seven... strategically placed... were buried too many stories beneath the ground. They could not have been detonated remotely. They had to have been triggered within a two-block radius. Put the gun down, Alex. Let me take you in before anybody else gets hurt. Caleb : Does anybody else have the shot? Take the shot, Alex. Alex! Ryan, what's going on? Alex. Booth's been hit. Asher, take him down. Asher's hit, too. All suspects accounted for, either downed or captured. He's down. It's over. I got you shot. I'm so sorry. Nimah! Ugh. Liam : Now it is really over. What did I tell you about recklessness, Parrish? If you can't be a team player, then what are you doing here? Your teammates died because of you. Caleb : Hey, Amin. No one was quicker to the trigger. You just had to get out of your head. You know, when you're not a crude, foul, unserious little boy, you can actually be very useful. You're a great analyst, Mr. Haas. If I have to be one, I might as well be a good one. My son was always... troubled. For a long time, I thought it was a phase. I hoped it would pass. And then a few years ago, I discovered that he met some people online who were ready to tap into his rage... give him purpose. The extremists? They reached him... in a way I couldn't. They spoke to him. They... [chuckles] They inspired him to impress them. So he made a plan... an attack at his high school, a school whose student population included the sons and daughters of many members of congress. You stopped him? I did everything I could to get his sentence reduced. He's serving two years in juvenile detention for the possession of an unregistered firearm. And he's up for parole. And the hardest part about all this is... ...I hope he doesn't get it. What kind of thing... is that for a mother to pray for her child? I am sorry, Miranda. For both of you. That's why you're here. The people who reached out to my son, they're reaching out to others. They're building cells on our soil. We need to infiltrate them, poison their network. I have a plan, but I need you. I need you both. I need you to work together as one. I let my emotions get in the way of my duty. It will never happen again. Yes, it will. You can't do your job and not care. But next time... next time, you'll know you have someone to talk to. You're never alone. [voice breaking] He's right. I am reckless. What am I still doing here? I'm not cut out for this. If those bullets were real today, you and Simon would be dead. It hit my shoulder. I would've recovered. You don't get it, Ryan. What, so you're just gonna quit? Sometimes you have to make a difficult decision for the greater good. I shouldn't be an agent, Ryan. People around me die. Alex... Alex. Alex, wait. Alex! Booth, thank God. Take her down. What are you doing? You both have to get out of here. What is going on? Alex, they tracked Simon's car. This whole place is gonna be surrounded in minutes. You got to go now. Nobody is going anywhere. Why don't we all just put our guns down... Don't you take another step. Shelby, put the gun down, please. Put it down! Simon, go get the gun. Okay. You both have to get out of here before they get here. I'm not leaving you with her. And I can't let you get caught with me. Simon, get him out of here. She's right. Let's go. Go! What are you gonna do, Alex? You gonna kill me? Shut up and move. What are you doing? I am taking you in. You can't outrun the FBI, Alex. [both grunting] Okay, fine. You want to turn me in? I give up. You bitch! Car keys, now. FBI agent : Search the perimeter. They can't have gotten far. [muffled screaming] Elias : Shocker. The organization you claimed to work for in Gaza has never heard of Simon Asher. When is this gonna end? Do you want to see my birth certificate? Want to meet my parents? I know you exist. That's not what scares me. It's who you are that does. Are you a patriot? Are you Jewish? Are you even gay? The answers are... yes, definitely, and no, but my boyfriend is. Because if you weren't gay, it'd be a great way to win your spot here. You know, the first openly gay NAT. The Bureau couldn't say no to that. Or it's just another piece of the facade of Simon Asher. Just like the glasses, just like the coffee I always see you make but never drink. The only thing real about you is the way you look at Nimah Amin when you think no one's looking. Even if all of that is true, why do you care? The most dangerous enemy America faces... is the enemy within... traitors who play the long game. And they inflict the deepest wounds because people miss the warning signs. And that's what you are, Simon Asher... one big, flashing warning sign. If you want to tell me the truth, you know where to find me. If not, you can wait until I present my case to Liam and Miranda. Have a good night, whoever you are. At least you're okay. I'm sorry. I should be used to it by now... you making rash decisions, leaving me holding the bag. I wanted to teach you a lesson, but I was wrong. [sighs] Do you know how it was like for me here, working for both of us, worrying all the time? I'm not the one who wanted to come here. I came for you because you're my sister and I would do anything for you. But this is too much. I'm not leaving again. Don't worry. I have to worry. We're committing to life as one agent, Nimah. One person. Sometimes I feel I'm losing myself. And I don't want to get lost, Nimah. I know who you are. And I know we make a great team. Do you have any idea how lucky we are to have each other? We will do important things together, Raina. We will save lives. Can I tell you what Miranda has planned for us now? Alex : When I heard you wanted to see me, I didn't realize it was an ambush. Where did you get that? I gave it to her. You want to talk to me about what happened today? Why you froze? I saw my father's face... And I just couldn't shake it. He was a good man and a decorated agent. And I... He died because of me. I thought I'd made my peace with it, but being here is just a constant reminder of the fact that... ...I killed a hero. What if I told you he had a bad reputation? That he was a drunk with a temper? That he abused his authority in the field, received several letters of censure? That he threatened your mother's life more than once and the Bureau ignored it? I'd say you were trying to make me feel better. You're punishing yourself because you think you killed a hero. But being a good agent... it doesn't mean you're a good man. That file isn't the whole story. Sit down, Alex. Alex, sit down. Don't let your guilt rewrite history. If you hadn't pulled the trigger, he would have killed your mother and maybe you, too. You made the only choice you could have in that moment. The right one. This job is filled with hard choices. But we make them. That's why we get to protect our country. Don't let your guilt destroy the career of one of the most promising trainees I've seen walk through these doors. ♪

♪ Father, Father, why you let me go? ♪ How long do we hold hands until it gets weird? I think now. Okay. [both laugh] Good to know. [knock on door] Is this a thing now? Us watching each other brush our teeth? I enrolled here because I wanted to find out the truth. And when I did, I thought maybe that's all I was here for. It wasn't your place to do what you did today. But I'm glad you did. It made me realize [sighs] I really want this. I just couldn't see it till the smoke cleared. So... thank you. Wow. You just thanked me. [chuckles] Not just for that. Also for staying put. No matter how hard I try to push you away, you just... you're always there. Well, from the moment I first saw you, I knew I didn't want to let you out of my sight. I'm glad. How glad? Well, maybe if you're lucky, someday I'll show you. [Andrew McMahon's "Maps for the Getaway" plays] Well, now I'm definitely not letting you out of my sight. [chuckles] Miranda : You're not the people you were when you came to Quantico. And you're not the special agents you'll become when you're done. You have a long way to go to deal with the stresses that come with this job. Because out in the field as agents, the stakes are life and death. It is what you do in those do-or-die moments, that's who you really are. You can spend 30 years doing solid work. One bad decision... ...can define your entire life with the FBI. That moment you got scared... ♪ And there's a light left on inside ♪ ...and didn't pull the trigger. That moment you pull the trigger and wish you hadn't. Hello? Hi, Mom. ♪ Orchestrating accidents ♪ Sita : Alex, how's school? ♪ Lights that used to blind us ♪ I can't live a lie anymore. What do you mean? When I told you I was going to grad school, I lied. What are you talking about? I joined the FBI, Mom. I don't understand. I'm at Quantico. ♪ No cash in the bank ♪ [gunshot] ♪ No paid holidays ♪ What are you doing here? Analysts aren't allowed to shoot. Well, my family's close with the Range Officer. He lets me come in on off hours, 'cause he knows, just like everybody else knows, that I'm never gonna be a special agent. I guess now that you're here, you're probably gonna report me. ♪ All we have is time ♪ I'll only report you if you can't keep up. The truth is... Whoa. ...no matter what we do, whether we take the shot or not, we have to deal with the consequences. I know for a fact that what you've been doing is off-book. You didn't do as you were told, and now I have to do it myself. Well, where'd the order come from, O'Connor, hmm? What the hell are you hiding? After what happened in Chicago... No, the only mistake I made there was keeping my mouth shut. And if you try to keep me under your thumb, I will go above you. Oh, you want to hear some truth, then? Yeah. The Bureau won't care what you have to say. I told you you were undercover here, but I lied. You're on probation. And as far as the Bureau's concerned, you are officially retraining. And if you fail out of here... you are out. So do whatever you want with the Assistant Director. She can't save you. They bought it. They have no idea you were there. I can't believe I trusted you. Okay, look, if my... if my allegiance was to the FBI, you and Alex would both be in handcuffs right now. I did what I could do. It is my ass on the line, too, you know. So, what the hell do we do now? ♪ Up. [groans] You're gonna tell me how this wire from your family business ended up as a part of those bombs. I don't have to tell you anything. Oh, you will, eventually. 'Cause you're my hostage now, and I will wait for as long as it takes. Clayton : All right, everybody, listen up. This order's just come through. Parrish has been in the wind long enough and she's taken another hostage. But from this point on, all law-enforcement agencies are being told if they see Parrish, they are to take no prisoners. From here on out, it's shoot to kill. ♪
