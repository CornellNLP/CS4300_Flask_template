 Previously on  Good Trouble... 
 You have massages available every day, and that is our meditation and yoga room. 
 You've got the nerve to bother the CEO over some stupid app idea. 
 - MARIANA: Oh. 
 - EVAN: Oh. 
 Maybe we can just get a drink one night. 
 - Sure. 
 - JAMIE: I still can't get over the Judge hiding his son upstairs. 
 - You get any idea why. 
 - No. 
 CALLIE:  I hope it's enough to cover your friends and family rate,  'cause I need a lawyer. 
 Maybe we can grab dinner some time. 
 - I am seeing Callie. 
 - Does she know about me? 
 It's not a competition. 
 KYLE: But if it was, I would totally win, right? 
 It's okay. 
 We can see other people. 
 - Kinda behind on rent. 
 - Can you ask Mom? 
 I don't want their help! 
 Davia's been hooking up with this guy from her hometown. 
 - He's married, Davia. 
 - I know. 
 You had a kid? 
 We lost him when he was six, rare cancer. 
 You told your friends I'm clerking the Jamal case? 
 No one's supposed to know what cases I'm working on.   
 BEN:  You live in a theater.   
 Do you know everyone who lives there?   
 CALLIE:  No, I don't.   
 (ELECTRONIC MUSIC PLAYING) 
 Ford Prefect. 
 Alex and Sam made me be the black guy because it's like brown-adjacent. 
 Mariana, I'm really sorry about what happened. 
 It's fine. 
 (MUSIC CONTINUING) 
 Are you nervous? 
 Yes. 
 But I have to tell Judge Wilson about Malika before Ben does. 
 Are you sure he knows that you live with her? 
 No, but I'm pretty sure    he suspects that I know her somehow. 
 Well, what do you think Judge Wilson's gonna do? 
 Best-case scenario, he takes me off the Jamal case,     
 - which will suck. 
 - Worst case? 
 I don't wanna think about worst case. 
 What's with the retro look? 
 It's Speckulate's fifth anniversary party, and it's a costume thing, 'cause, well, nerds. 
 I'm going as Margaret Hamilton. 
 - Who? 
 - She is a brilliant lady engineer who ran MIT's Instrumentation Lab in the '  s. 
 I'm hoping to steal some of her mental mojo, even though I'm not half as smart as she is. 
 Don't say that. 
 You're brilliant. 
 Hardly. 
 Did something else happen at work? 
 I know you're used to coding for grades in school, but out in the world, there is no such thing as a B plus. 
 It's good or it sucks. 
 And this... sucks. 
 Just... more of the same. 
 Do you ever feel like you're an impostor? 
 Like you tricked someone into hiring you and you're just waiting for them to realize you're not as good as everyone else? 
 I worked my ass off to get where I am. 
 And so did you. 
 Ain't no trick about it. 
 I have to get to work before Ben and Rebecca. 
 But don't doubt yourself. 
 You're a superstar. 
 Good luck.

 Did you really just bang an age-appropriate woman? 
 - Ha-ha. 
 - What? 
 Dennis, with a woman his own age? 
 - Did I miss it? 
 - DAVIA: Sadly, yes. 
 That's like an eclipse. 
 It will be a while before it happens again. 
 Davia, why are you so obsessed with who I sleep with? 
 Well, it's either that or talk about your "music," so...

 You wanted to speak to me, Callie? 
 Yes, sir. 
 Wait inside my chambers. 
 I'll be with you in a few minutes. 
 (ELECTRONIC MUSIC PLAYING) 
 (INDISTINCT CHATTER) 
 MARIANA:  It's about not getting scolded   for a few misnamed files   and having too much flair in my comments,   but now Alex is saying that I'm not experienced enough   to work on any new projects.   
 This is completely wrong. 
 Your syntax is sloppy. 
 You need to cut down on your commenting. 
 An SEO isn't just for marketing. 
 There is a technical aspect to it as well. 
 MARIANA:  I'm stuck doing maintenance,  which sucks because... 
 now I can't work on Evan's new secret project. 
 What? 
 (CLAPS) 
 Congrats, Team Blue. 
 (GRUNTS) 
 What did we do? 
 Got a primo project coming your way. 
 Evan's top priority. 
 All confidential. 
 Evan will unveil the details at the party, but I wanted to give you guys a heads-up so you could get on top of it  ASAFP. 
 Three words:     New... 
 (WHISPERING): ... social...     network. 
 We're gonna destroy Facebook. 
 (WHISPERING): The new social network. 
 I know what it is. 
 - Oh. 
 - ALEX:  Okay.   This is passable. 
 So, uh, when do I get my assignment? 
 You know, for the... 
 (WHISPERING): ... new social network. 
 Yeah. 
 Um, you're not. 
 The... 
 It's-It's a huge project. 
 We need experienced engineers. 
 The guys won't have time to... 
 uh, hold your hand. 
 But you'll still focus on maintenance of existing apps. 
 That work for you? 
 Yeah. 
 CASEY:  And Alex is right.  Syntax is important. 
 Comments aren't for comedy. 
 And everyone starts with maintenance work. 
 That's how you learn how things are done around here. 
 I gotta go. 
 ♪ ♪     Sorry, it, uh... 
 took longer than expected. 
 So what's on your mind? 
 I have something I need to disclose. 
 I know someone... 
 an activist who's been involved in protesting the Jamal Thompson case, and she has a personal relationship with Jamal's mother Sandra. 
 Hmm. 
 - How do you know her? 
 - She lives in my building. 
 I've been very careful in all my interactions with her to never discuss anything about the case, but... 
 there is the appearance of impropriety to consider, so I thought it was important to tell you. 
 That's significant conflict of interest, Callie, one that you should have disclosed to me weeks ago. 
 You're off the Thompson case... 
 and you're fired. 
 Okay. 
 I appreciate your candor. 
 Thank you, sir. 
 Because you've proved to me that you're honest and forthright, I trust you can be discreet. 
 Therefore, as long as you continue to refrain discussing the case with this person, I see no reason to take you off it. 
 Speaking of the Thompson case, defense filed a motion this morning to suppress Officer Griffin's personnel records. 
 Why? 
 What's in them? 
 Something they consider prejudicial. 
 Like a history of using excessive force? 
 Complaints. 
 But no disciplinary action was deemed necessary. 
 Conveniently. 
 Read the motion, write up a memo. 
 I'm sure you'll let me know why... 
 the motion should be denied. 
 I'm sure I will. 
 Can I, uh... 
 ask a favor? 
 Of course. 
 I'd appreciate it if you didn't tell the others about my son. 
 That he's not studying abroad. 
 Actually, that night, I did mention that I had seen him. 
 That's all I told them. 
 Very well. 
 That's all. 
 ♪ ♪     Hey, remember that woman in the courtroom? 
 The one you asked me about? 
 She was with Jamal's mother? 
 - Uh-huh. 
 - I realized I did recognize her from somewhere else. 
 She, um, lives in my building. 
 Anyway, I just told the judge. 
 Really? 
 Hmm. 
 What did he have to say? 
 Just as long as I keep my distance and don't discuss the case with her, he doesn't think it's a problem. 
 Wow. 
 The clerk before you got taken off a case for liking a tweet of a friend of a friend connected to a case. 
 Whatever you have on Wilson must be good. 
 BARBARA: Ben... 
 the judge will see you now. 
 That's okay. 
 I, uh, answered my own question. 
 ♪ ♪     (ELECTRONIC MUSIC PLAYING) 
 (INDISTINCT CHATTER) 
 I need a lawyer. 
 You need a lawyer to change your name? 
 And gender marker. 
 It's more to it than you think. 
 Of course lawyers cost money. 
 I'm not asking you to pay. 
 I'm just saying, it'd be a lot easier to get a job and keep it if I didn't have to explain when my ID doesn't say Jazmin on it. 
 What happened with that retail gig? 
 I got clocked, and my manager suddenly cut my hours so I called her out, and now I have no hours. 
 Why does this keep happening? 
 It's not my fault the world is full of bigots. 
 I got to stand up for myself. 
 For what's right. 
 How are things in the fishbowl? 
 This place offered me a full-time gig. 
 Isn't that more hours? 
 And responsibility. 
 But also better pay and benefits. 
 JAZMIN:  It's a trap job.      You get used to the perks of corporate life, and suddenly, there's no time for your art. 
 You don't need that. 
 Or I need money to make my art. 
 You'll get by. 
 Money has a way of working itself out, especially for you. 
 It's not just about me, you know. 
 I have my sister to worry about. 
 She needs help. 
 Hormones. 
 Rent. 
 Asking your parents for help an option? 
 (SIGHS) 
 How was your trip back home? 
 Mom and Dad asked about you. 
 Me? 
 Or their son? 
 They're trying to avoid pronouns. 
 Seems like progress. 
 Oh, my gosh. 
 I wish we could be a family again. 
 That's up to them. 
 Why don't you meet them half way? 
 How am I supposed to do that? 
 Be half of who I am? 
 I mean, you shouldn't have to, but... 
 you know, sometimes, you gotta put up with crap, you know, to keep people in your life, to keep a job. 
 You don't have to drag everyone who offends you. 
 CALLIE:  Are you close with your parents?  Less since they're having such a hard time accepting Jazmin. 
 She hates that I even talk to them, that I haven't told them that I'm bi. 
 You know, I don't see the point until I'm ready to bring somebody home, you know. 
 I feel for my sister. 
 I do. 
 I don't know, she puts up with a lot of discrimination. 
 But she can't keep a job. 
 Well, California has laws to protect her. 
 (SIGHS) 
 I hate to say it, but... 
 sometimes I think she brings it on herself. 
 - Hey. 
 - Hey, brother. 
 What are you doing here? 
 What does it look like? 
 I'm working. 
 Tiny tofu tostada? 
 Smells good. 
 What're you making? 
 A frittata. 
 Too scared to fold it over and call it an omelet? 
 (CHUCKLES) 
 Oh, if you feel like making two,     
 - I'd be happy to join you. 
 - (CELL PHONE BUZZING) 
 - (CELL PHONE CHIMES) 
 - Oh, sh1t. 
 _     Jeff's just been acting so weird since I told him that I've been thinking about moving back to Wisconsin. 
 - We were supposed to talk tonight, but... 
 - (CELL PHONE CHIMES) 
 ... 
 now he's saying his wife's book club got canceled. 
 Ugh. 
 If that boring shrew is even in a book club... 
 So you justify dating a married guy because his wife's a shrew? 
 She really is though. 
 We went to high school together. 
 She's a total mean girl. 
 Who's the mean girl now? 
 Okay, king of one-night stands, simmer. 
 So you can dish it out, but you can't take it. 
 All you do, Davia, is judge under the guise of "calling it like it is" or "just saying what everyone else is thinking." I can guarantee you that nobody here feels sorry     that your married boyfriend won't leave his wife. 
 CALLIE: What if Judge Wilson let me keep the Jamal case as like a quid pro quo for not telling anyone his son's wearing an ankle monitor? 
 Well, what if he did? 
 He trusts your discretion, and there's no reason you need to tell anyone about his son's situation. 
 Unless his son was arrested by the LAPD and is waiting to be charged or tried. 
 Isn't it a conflict of interest for Wilson to preside over the Jamal case if the police were the defendants? 
 I mean, if he's easy on them, will they be easy on his son and vice versa. 
 I don't know if it's a clear conflict of interest. 
 Even if it's a gray area, maybe that's why Wilson's being so secretive about Tate. 
 Or it's a family matter that Wilson wants to keep private. 
 It is embarrassing for a judge's kid to get arrested. 
 You know, especially one who has his eye on the Supreme Court. 
 - I wonder what he did? 
 - I can find out. 
 - No! 
 - Yeah. 
 No, I don't want him thinking   
 - that I'm looking into his son. 
 - Don't worry. 
 You're not the only one known for their discretion. 
 - Well, thank you. 
 - Mm-hmm. 
 I'm sorry I'm always asking for your advice. 
 You paid a hefty retainer. 
 Best dollar I ever spent. 
 (CLEARS THROAT) 
 Uh, so it's customary, by the way, for me to take out new clients. 
 You know, wine and dine them, make sure they're happy with the service. 
 I am happy with the service. 
 Just a little overwhelmed. 
 Oh, sure. 
 Yeah. 
 Between work, the bar, and conspiracy theories about your judge. 
 Just wanted you to know if you need a distraction, consider me on-call.

 So this is my friend Callie. 
 Hi. 
 It's really nice to meet you. 
 Nice to meet you too. 
 Um, So Gael filled me in, and I'm happy to help, but you don't really need a lawyer to change your name and gender     on your birth certificate. 
 Actually, I do... 
 because I have a felony. 
 I was at a club right after I transitioned. 
 These guys started harassing me. 
 And someone called the cops. 
 But when they got there, they asked me to leave. 
 Not the guys who were attacking me. 
 I told them, I know my rights. 
 But this one cop grabbed me by the arm and I yanked it back, and he got pissed and slammed me against the wall. 
 And he cuffed me for resisting arrest. 
 Oh, my God, Jazmin, you have to be more careful. 
 I had every right to be there. 
 Was it worth it? 
 They could have really hurt you. 
 You did have every right to be there. 
 And they should not have charged you since you weren't under arrest when he grabbed you. 
 I couldn't afford a lawyer. 
 And I know I wouldn't be safe in jail. 
 So I pled guilty, and I got sentenced to one year of probation. 
 Jazmin, why didn't you tell me? 
 'Cause I didn't want Mom and Dad to find out. 
 And I wasn't sure you'd be on my side. 
 How can you even say that? 
 I have always been on your side. 
 CALLIE: Look, you're right. 
 It is more complicated if have a record to change your name and marker because you have to prove that you're not trying to evade the authorities or anything. 
 But it is doable. 
 I can't pay you. 
 - And I don't want you too. 
 - I'm happy to help for free. 
 Truly. 
 I haven't even passed the bar, so... 
 Thank you. 
 You have really nice friends. 
 (PEOPLE CHATTERING) 
 You like cheese. 
 Oh, uh, would you like some? 
 You know, they spray the outside of the cheese with mold to create the rind. 
 In fact, most of the cheese we eat has a certain amount of pus in it. 
 due to the bacterial infection in udders. 
 Wow, that, uh, kinda ruins cheese. 
 (CHUCKLES) 
 Why? 
 Which KISS? 
 I'm sorry? 
 Oh! 
 He came up to me.

 Or Neil deGrasse Tyson. 
 You know, both huge Trekkies,    
 - by the way. 
 - Sam. 
 No. 
 What? 
 It would just be nice if I felt heard every once in a while. 
 Hey, I have an idea. 
 Maybe you should go to the party as Mariana. 
 'Cause that's who you're acting like right now. 
 I never gave you final word. 
 Tell him... 
 that if he can't delegate,     
 - he's a pretty terrible leader. 
 Pretty sure you heard that... 
 Raj, tell Sam that talking to me through you    
 - is extremely childish. 
 Then why is he doing it? 
 ALEX: Fine. 
 We don't have to go as a team. 
 - Go as a  Twilight  vampire for all I care. 
 Who's being ridiculous now? 
 Huh? 
 - Not me. 
 Well, you're like a kid in a custody battle. 
 Whose costume are you gonna choose? 
 How can I give up the chance to be Zaphod Beeblebrox. 
 Beeblebrox. 
 It's just fun to say.

 I didn't see anyone uncomfortable today but you. 
 It's not worth it. 
 Let's just go. 
 No. 
 This is bullshit. 
 - And who the hell are you? 
 - I'm her brother. 
 All right. 
 And who the hell are you? 
 Besides some bigoted asshole? 
 (CHUCKLES) 
 Oh, man, you gotta get out of my face. 
 Or what, huh? 
 Gael, it's not worth your job. 
 Let's just go. 
 Come on. 
 JAMIE: Yeah, you definitely have cause to sue. 
 But these things, they cost a lot of money. 
 And I'm sure the caterer has insurance that will cover all their legal expenses. 
 I'll cover Jazmin's expenses. 
 No, you won't. 
 I'm gonna take the full-time job at Speckulate. 
 Don't do that for me. 
 I'm not. 
 I've thought about it, and it's a good opportunity for me. 
 Look, I'm so sorry, Jazmin. 
 You were right. 
 I haven't always been     on your side enough. 
 But you can't keep dealing with this sh1t. 
 And people can't keep getting away with it. 
 Look, if we win, you could get some money to get you on your feet. 
 What about your art? 
 I'm not gonna give up on that. 
 I just gotta be more hardcore about doing it nights and weekends. 
 It's all good. 
 We appreciate any help you guys can give us. 
 (POP MUSIC PLAYING ON SPEAKERS) 
 - Oh, sorry, I... 
 - EVAN: I'm sorry, I didn't... 
 - No, no, I just... 
 - MARIANA: I was just working. 
 - You go. 
 - Go ahead. 
 Okay, I'll go. 
 I just wanted to ask... 
 if you hate parties. 
 Um... 
 no. 
 Oh. 
 Because I noticed that you were by yourself... 
 alone... 
 a lot. 
 No, no, it was, it was a great party. 
 Thank you so much. 
 I thought it was boring. 
 In social situations, I don't really like to talk to people. 
 I find the energy I give out doesn't really have a compensatory return. 
 In most cases. 
 Well, yeah, that's true of some people around here. 
 - Me? 
 - No. 
 No. 
 No. 
 You're not boring. 
 Really? 
 Thank you. 
 You're not boring either. 
 Thank you. 
 (CHUCKLES) 
 - (CLINKING) 
 - Uh, oh, sorry. 
 I dropped one of my bullets. 
 - Bullets? 
 - Uh, no, they're not real bullets. 
 They're, uh, these magnetic things. 
 They help... me. 
 I think it fell under the desk over there. 
 Oh, uh... 
 Oh... 
 I-I'll get it. 
 Mariana, um, can we please talk? 
 - Found it. 
 - RAJ: I'm sorry, I can come back. 
 It's okay. 
 Good night. 
 (SNEAKERS SQUEAKING) 
 Anyway, I-I misread all the signals last night... 
 Look, it's fine, Raj. 
 Really. 
 There's nothing to talk about. 
 Okay. 
 Well, I really am sorry. 
 Actually, you know what? 
 It's not fine. 
 And it's, it's not about misreading signals, it's about it being totally inappropriate to try to kiss one of your co-workers. 
 I mean, like, duh. 
 I-I mean, seriously, did you really think that asking me to help you with your work and, and telling me that I have such great ideas and then trying to kiss me wouldn't make you look like you're completely full of crap. 
 And make me feel even more disrespected and vulnerable than I already do around here? 
 So sorry. 
 But sorry doesn't cut it. 
 The case is winnable, right? 
 JAMIE: It's definitely worth pursuing. 
 If she's willing to go through the wringer for it. 
 You think your firm could take it on pro bono? 
 Look, if we can't, I'll try to find someone who can. 
 - (ELEVATOR BELL DINGS) 
 - At least at a nice discount. 
 Thank you. 
 Oh, um, Gael... 
 just a friend? 
 It's not my business. 
 I just like to know who I'm up against. 
 Well, we are seeing other people, if that's what you're asking. 
 (STRUMMING) 
 This is for you. 
 From Jennifer. 
 I met her in the lobby. 
 So you were married. 
 That seem so crazy? 
 Honestly? 
 Totally bonkers. 
 (LAUGHS) 
 I... 
 I know I'm judgmental. 
 Which is really weird because... 
 I've been judged my whole life for being fat, anorexic... 
 dating a married guy. 
 I know how awful it feels. 
 So why am I judging people back? 
 A nice person wouldn't do that, so... 
 I guess I'm not a nice person. 
 This is where you're supposed to disagree. 
 Oh. 
 (CHUCKLES) 
 My bad. 
 You're really nice. 
 - (SCOFFS) 
 - (DENNIS LAUGHS) 
 Way to sell it. 
 So did she cheat on you? 
 Is that... 
 why you wigged out    
 - on me yesterday? 
 - DENNIS: No. 
 I cheated on her. 
 So, yeah... 
 no right to judge. 
 Why'd you do it? 
 It's complicated. 
 But it wasn't because I was in love with the other woman or... 
 because I ever stopped loving my wife. 
 No matter what you may think or hope with this guy... 
 you know it doesn't end well. 
 Yeah. 
 (STRUMMING GUITAR) 
 What are you playing? 
 I thought you didn't want to talk about my music... 
 - Oh, come on. 
 - ... Davia. 
 - Let me hear it.
