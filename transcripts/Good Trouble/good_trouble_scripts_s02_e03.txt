 You ever been in love? 
  Once. 
  His name was Elijah. 
  - Sorry. 
  - For what? 
  - Hurting you. 
  - I should have fought for you. 
  I know you're seeing Jamie. 
  If you have any doubts that he's the guy for you Yeah, Jamie and I are on a break. 
  - Whose arms do you want around you? 
  - Oh. 
  Oops. 
  Gotta say, Gael, your new piece might be my favorite. 
  You did that last night? 
  So, I recently came out to my parents. 
  They're fine with me being gay, as long as I'm not too gay. 
  There's something I want to talk to you about. 
  I'm thinking of changing my pronouns to they/them. 
  Hey, have you ever had s*x at work before? 
  I saw Evan leave. 
  Angela, can I speak with you? 
  In private. 
  I think we should implement a rule that supervisors cannot date anyone who works under them. 
  - Agreed. 
  - A letter from our father. 
  I wonder where he is. 
  If he's still inside? 
  Yo, who cares? 
  We don't know him, and he doesn't want to know us. 
  We don't need to go looking for more pain and disappointment. 
  - So, you're trans? 
  - I just like to be upfront about it. 
  Free tomorrow night? 
  - I'm kind of behind on rent. 
  - Shouldn't you ask Mom or Dad? 
  You know that's not an option for me. 
  If they knew that you were in trouble? 
  I don't want their help. 
  I'm done tolerating intolerant people! 
  Uh, excuse me. 
  Excuse me! 
  Hi, I'm Alice. 
  Kwan. 
  Like, like, Tae Kwan Do. 
  Except I'm not Korean, so I don't know why I said that. 
  Seriously, this is an amazing event. 
  I mean, everyone these days is so brave you know, just choosing to live out loud and proud in their true genders, and owning their sexuality, and protesting against injustice, getting bangs. 
  Yeah. 
  People just be out here getting bangs y'all. 
  So bold, you know? 
  Meanwhile, I'm terrified of making choices. 
  And forget about boundaries, ya know? 
  I let people walk all over me. 
  And I'm just talking the Thai massage lady. 
  So, when are we going to have lunch with Joey-anna? 
  She is a they? 
  And we told you no short hair. 
  Uh, she's out of town on business. 
  But I'll let you know when she gets back. 
  - I gotta go. 
  Love you. 
  - Hey. 
  - Who was that? 
  - Just my mom. 
  You know moms, blah blah blah. 
  Um, are you using those? 
  My girlfriend Uh, excuse me. 
  No, my they-friend just changed their pronoun from "her-she" to "they-them". 
  Which blows my mind, cause I'm not even sure who "I-me" is, and I get Groupons. 
  Anyway, let's first wish a very happy birthday - to Jazmin Martinez - Evan's here. 
  Evan. 
  Thank you so much for coming. 
  Beta test for Act-ivism, wouldn't miss it. 
  Well, I know how you feel about parties. 
  They're not so bad when you're at them. 
  Anyway, I guess what I'm saying, uh, besides the fact that I clearly need therapy, um, that it's-it's an honor to be celebrating this amazing woman tonight. 
  And our amazing transgender service members who are fighting to be seen and treated with the dignity they deserve. 
  So without further ado, I give you your quinceaÃ±era, Jazmin. 
  So I met with my board of directors today and I told them all about your app. 
  And they were surprised that we were wasting our time and resources on Act-ivism. 
  Well, that's not good. 
  No, it is. 
  That's how much I believe in you. 
  What's happening? 
  Oh, it's the group dance. 
  It's a quinceaÃ±era tradition. 
  Whoo! 
  Whoo! 
  Good Trouble 2x03 Doble Quince I want to thank you all for coming tonight. 
  What an amazing turnout! 
  Are you okay? 
  - Yeah. 
  - Did I suck? 
  - No. 
  You were funny. 
  - I served in the army for six years. 
  I fought in Afghanistan and Iraq. 
  But the hardest battle of my life was for my own identity. 
  And what about when you ate all the arroz con leche? 
  - Before dinner. 
  - I did not. 
  Venga, amigo. 
  I caught you in the kitchen with your face covered in canela. 
  Okay, fine, but it wasn't just me. 
  Jazmin helped. 
  Okay Is this how it's always gonna be? 
  I mention Jazmin and everyone just gets quiet and changes the subject? 
  We always celebrated your birthdays together. 
  How many celebrations are we gonna leave her out of? 
  - Gael. 
  - CafÃ©? 
  Okay, fine. 
  We won't talk about her, but she wants her dog tags. 
  No. 
  Those belong to Alejandro. 
  She still served her country. 
  She deserves her tags. 
  Why does he want Alejandro's dog tags if Alejandro is dead to him? 
  Because she needs them for her quinceaÃ±era. 
  Too often, we focus on the trauma of transgender lives. 
  So, I wanted to have this Doble Quince with my beautiful damas, to celebrate our thriving lives. 
  What is the point of a, um a quince quince QuinceaÃ±era? 
  It means 15 years. 
  Traditionally it marks like, a girl's coming of age. 
  For Jazmin, it's her Doble Quince because she's 30 and she never to have a quince when she was 15, obviously. 
  That's lovely. 
  Did you have a quinceaÃ±era? 
  I did. 
  It was really fun. 
  And so tonight, I want to bring awareness and support to the 134,000 American trans veterans and over 15,000 active members serving today. 
  All of the money raised tonight will go towards helping transgender veterans and military members get the services they need and support their right in serving openly and honorably. 
  I met my father. 
  How'd that go? 
  We always thought that he just up and left. 
  My mom never said anything good about him. 
  She never told us he went to prison. 
  You look like your mother. 
  She always said I look like you. 
  Oh, well. 
  I wouldn't wish that on anyone. 
  How is your mother? 
  Uh, she passed recently. 
  Oh, no. 
  Uh Man, I'm so sorry. 
  I didn't know. 
  How long was he in for? 
  Ten years. 
  Can I ask what you went to prison for? 
  - Short story, drugs. 
  - What's the long story? 
  He got pulled over for some bullshit traffic violation. 
  They planted crack in my car. 
  It was only a matter of time. 
  They wanted me off the streets. 
  He was a Black Panther. 
  When I was seventeen, I joined the party. 
  I don't know how much you know about the Panthers. 
  What? 
  A lot. 
  Did you ever meet Huey Newton? 
  No, I never did. 
  I knew Bobby Seale though. 
  Anyway, I mean, we were just talking for hours about how the FBI was assassinating and, and jailing the leadership, and how they did a bunch of covert stuff to cause dissent inside the party. 
  How the same thing is happening today, with B. L. M. being targeted by infiltrators who make them out to be some sort of terrorist organization. 
  Black power scares the hell out of people in this country. 
  As if, if we're empowered with equity, we're gonna take all the money and privilege away from them. 
  Right. 
  Most of what we did in the Panthers was for the community. 
  You know, making free breakfasts for the kids in the morning, providing health services, sickle cell testing. 
  When it all fell apart, I went to college. 
  Met your mother. 
  She didn't want me out there again, organizing. 
  But I knew our survival depended on protest. 
  Our lives begin to end the day we become silent about the things that matter. 
  I don't regret my choice to fight but I do regret not being there for you and your mother, brother. 
  Does Dom know you connected with y'all father? 
  Dom's not ready for all this. 
  Are you? 
  Yeah, I am. 
  I just want you to take care of yourself. 
  You know, with your, your mother just passing and graduation coming, you have a right to focus on you and your future. 
  I know that. 
  And I am. 
  Don't worry. 
  So, anyway, besides organizing and promoting tonight's event, guests can use the Act-ivism app to place bids on auction items and make donations. 
  Which will be projected on those monitors whenever we open the bids. 
  We'll be able to see how much we're making donations-wise in real time, and hopefully it'll inspire people to donate more. 
  Oh, but you know what? 
  Um, enough shop talk. 
  Have you met my sister Callie? 
  Callie! 
  Callie! 
  Callie, this is Evan. 
  Um, if you will excuse me, I have I'll be right back. 
  I got to go. 
  I've heard so much about you. 
  You have? 
  From who? 
  From Mariana. 
  Ah. 
  So, did you have a, a quinceaÃ±era? 
  No. 
  Excuse me. 
  Hey. 
  I need you, now. 
  What's wrong? 
  The app is crashing! 
  Oh, my God, we loved your set! 
  Yeah, you're her-sterical. 
  Oh, thanks. 
  I mean, it wasn't a full set. 
  Well, where do you do stand-up? 
  In the shower mostly. 
  Okay, well, we host a comedy show. 
  It's women, it's queer, it's amazing. 
  You should come through. 
  Maybe get on stage. 
  It's a chill space to try out new material. 
  Totally, that sounds really fun, actually. 
  - Thanks! 
  - Let me put my number in your phone. 
  Oh, yeah. 
  Uh, uh, do you mind? 
  Okay And you should hit me up on Instagram too. 
  I'm amazing at creating content. 
  Oh, nice. 
  Sydney. 
  Like in Australia. 
  Is your name Melbourne? 
  Koalas. 
  Oh, sorry. 
  This is, uh, my girlfriend Joey. 
  - Partner. 
  - Oh, right. 
  Sorry. 
  Hi. 
  Hey. 
  You're fun. 
  Uh, okay, maybe we see you on Tuesday. 
  See you next Tuesday. 
  - Ohhh! 
  - That means I shouldn't say that. 
  What? 
  You having fun? 
  It's the best night of my life. 
  Well, I'll try to keep those bests going later on tonight. 
  I'm so proud of you for doing this. 
  And I'm sorry I didn't get your dog tags. 
  It's okay. 
  But I did get you this. 
  Gael? 
  I'm not sure if it goes with your dress, but I love it. 
  Thank you. 
  I haven't had a chance to thank you for making her dress. 
  It's stunning. 
  It was a labor of love. 
  I'm glad she asked. 
  You could have asked. 
  But I know why you didn't. 
  Same reason why you won't let me buy one of your pieces. 
  Don't want to owe me anything. 
  I just want things to be clean between us. 
  After everything. 
  I'm not that guy anymore. 
  So, are you going to tell Gael that you're back with Jamie? 
  No. 
  What am I supposed to do, just walk up to him and say, "Hey, I'm seeing Jamie again, just F. Y. I. " Not like he's waiting for me to make some decision. 
  Are you sure about that? 
  Yes. 
  I am sure. 
  Besides, I think he's seeing his ex again. 
  Bryan? 
  No. 
  Elijah. 
  If my app crashes in front of Evan, he'll totally lose faith in me. 
  Plus, his board of directors already aren't supportive, and the bro-holes at Speckulate will be like, "Oh, I told you that women engineers aren't as smart as men. 
  " Not to mention, letting Gael and Jazmin down, and the entire trans community. 
  Just don't panic, okay? 
  We can fix it. 
  Uh, did you verify the server response is correct? 
  Y-you were in charge of all of the recent server changes. 
  That you requested, I just typed them up. 
  No offense, but no one has much ownership on anything here but you. 
  Wh-what is that supposed to mean? 
  That you don't delegate. 
  You control everything. 
  Wow! 
  Okay, fine. 
  You fix it then. 
  - What are you doing? 
  - This is me delegating. 
  Okay, fine. 
  I'll fix it. 
  - Hey! 
  - Hey! 
  I'm so glad you're here. 
  I just want to say, you look so beautiful. 
  Oh, thank you. 
  Is, uh, Jamie here? 
  He wishes he could be here, but, uh, he has a work thing. 
  Aw, too bad. 
  I was just curious, because, well, I invited him, but I never heard back. 
  You invited him? 
  So, how do you feel about Drake? 
  Drake? 
  Not a "Hotline Bling" kind of gal? 
  Oh, yeah. 
  That's exactly it. 
  Yeah. 
  Yeah. 
  Well, I can get tickets to his concert Saturday night. 
  Saturday night? 
  Um, I promised Mariana I'd go to this work thing. 
  Something to do with the launch of her app. 
  Yeah, no worries. 
  You sure it looks good there? 
  Yeah, looks great. 
  Let's eat. 
  Yeah. 
  I mean, he was so sweet in helping with my settlement. 
  Well, give him my love. 
  I will. 
  There. 
  I think I fixed it. 
  Wait, you think? 
  I did fix it. 
  Well, how do we know? 
  I know. 
  I think. 
  How's it going? 
  Psh. 
  Good. 
  Thanks for helping out tonight. 
  Oh, happy to. 
  Plus, I can use the tips. 
  Yeah, how, how are you doing with money? 
  Mm, I could always use more. 
  I could put a word in at my job. 
  We could be a brother-sister bartending duo at Duoro. 
  - Okay. 
  - I'm serious! 
  It'd be fun to work together. 
  Hey! 
  Okay. 
  If it's not a problem. 
  Yeah, it's no problem. 
  I got your back. 
  I appreciate that. 
  Damn. 
  Okay, Mr. 
  Hall. 
  Hey your damn self, Ms. 
  Williams. 
  Sorry I'm late. 
  It's okay. 
  You got a business to run. 
  How you doing, man? 
  Isaac. 
  - Dom. 
  - Nice to meet you, my man. 
  Malika. 
  - Oh, hey. 
  - Hey. 
  Hey! 
  Thanks for hooking us up with your girl Mariana. 
  We're excited for B. L. M. to consult her new app. 
  So, when we talk about police killing our people You know, those 460 people killed by police and still awaiting justice? 
  In Black Lives Matter, we understand it's a whole system - that includes District Attorneys. 
  - Yep. 
  And we have to think about how to address these D. A. 's in this country, that are in sweetheart deals with the police. 
  Where they won't even open up investigations, let alone prosecute, until they get the investigation of the police who actually murdered our folks. 
  This is why police are almost never prosecuted for killing our people. 
  Well, I really want to be a part of the transformation, not just the response. 
  I want to do more. 
  That's dope! 
  We'd love to have you get in deeper. 
  Yeah, and the work you did for Jamal? 
  That was powerful. 
  Thank you. 
  What does more look like for you? 
  I don't know. 
  I just, I just know this work speaks to my soul. 
  Yeah, that's cause the turn up is like taking our power back. 
  It's, it's therapeutic, it's invigorating, it's meaningful, - and that's not all there is to it. 
  - At all. 
  There's the late nights on the phone with families - who are crying because they miss their babies. 
  - Mm-hmm. 
  Cause Jamal's not just a cause to his mother. 
  He's her child. 
  You know, folks love the visible work: being in front of the news cameras, but it's the invisible work, that's the work that actually matters. 
  And if you're ready to help with that, we are so ready to have you. 
  Ready. 
  You ready? 
  I'm ready. 
  All right! 
  Welcome Malika! 
  Thank you, thank you. 
  - Isaac, this is Tiana. 
  - Hi. 
  - Hi. 
  - This is - Isaac? 
  - Isaac, yeah. 
  - Nice to meet you. 
  - Nice, nice to meet you. 
  Yeah. 
  Um, we're going to the city council meeting Wednesday night to protest the new prison build. 
  We'll see you there? 
  - Yes, you will. 
  - All right. 
  So, Jazmin invited Jamie to her quinceaÃ±era. 
  So? 
  I thought you said he couldn't come. 
  - I didn't invite him. 
  - Why? 
  I just didn't want it to be awkward for Gael, like, it's his sister's party. 
  Why would it be awkward for Gael if he's not waiting around for you? 
  I was just trying to be sensitive to his feelings. 
  Okay. 
  Well, what about Jamie's feelings? 
  I mean, seriously Callie, you really think he's not going to find out about tonight? 
  Hello, Instagram. 
  Jamie doesn't have Instagram. 
  The point is: the reason you haven't told Gael about Jamie is because you don't want him to move on, 'cause you always have one foot out the door. 
  I mean, when are you gonna make a serious choice with these guys and not have them hanging on a hook? 
  - Or line? 
  - Excuse me? 
 
 
 
  Can I have your attention? 
  Dangling? 
  I dunno. 
  Whatever the expression is. 
  You know what I'm trying to say. 
  Sorry. 
  I'm hoping everyone has downloaded the Act-ivism app and has had a chance to shop some of the auction items. 
  Bids and donations are now officially open! 
  Everything okay? 
  Yeah, just doing some last-minute penetration testing. 
  On the app! 
  Got pretty funky out there. 
  Thanks, daddio. 
  You look beautiful tonight. 
  Thank you. 
  So do you. 
  Thanks. 
  Can I ask, are you seeing Elijah? 
  No. 
  I'm not seeing anyone. 
  Who's that? 
  QuinceaÃ±era? 
  Doble quince, actually. 
  That's ridiculous. 
  Dad, no, it's not, and she's doing it as a fundraiser to help fight the transgender military ban. 
  Those people shouldn't be in the military. 
  - Why not? 
  - Because they disrupt order. 
  That is not true. 
  If he wants his dog tags, They don't belong to him anymore! 
  She served her country the same as you did, and abuelo did. 
  And she did it for you, to make you proud, and you were so proud of her. 
  I was proud of Alejandro. 
  My son. 
  I miss my son, but she took him away from us. 
  She killed him. 
  She didn't kill anyone, Dad! 
  Your child is still alive. 
  We only have one child now. 
  One son who hasn't brought shame on us. 
  You know what? 
  If Jazmin is no longer your child because she's trans, then I guess you have no children at all, because I'm bisexual. 
  That is my grandfather. 
  - Jazmin? 
  - Abuelo. 
  What are you doing here? 
  I know what's it like, I know how it feels Let the pain break you down now You gotta give it time to heal Don't worry now, even though the fear is real Just hold on If you're ready, start again, I'll be here waiting Reaching out my hand Love is the answer Love is the answer Just hold on Just hold on You okay? 
  Yeah. 
  Blown away, but definitely okay. 
  It's amazing my abuelo came. 
  He's so old school, you know? 
  If he can accept Jazmin, it gives me hope that my parents will come around some day. 
  That's wonderful. 
  - Callie, I - I'm seeing Jamie again. 
  I didn't know if I needed to tell you that but You didn't. 
  I want you to be happy, Callie. 
  Thank you. 
  You too. 
  I'm sorry that I yelled at you and I'm sorry that I'm a micromanager. 
  You can't help it, and you're not. 
  Yes, I am. 
  I was just being defensive. 
  Yeah, because I blamed you. 
  Because it was my fault. 
  No. 
  It was my fault, and I wish I could kiss you right now. 
  Me too. 
  Excuse me. 
  Excuse me. 
  Sorry to stop the music. 
  I just wanted to announce that we raised close to 20 thousand dollars tonight! 
  Thank you all for your generosity and a huge thank you to Mariana for her Act-ivism app. 
  Let's hear it for Mariana. 
  Mariana, I'm Kirk, with Center for Transgender Veterans. 
  Seriously, your app is amazing. 
  With a crowd this size, we expected maybe to raise half this much. 
  So, thank you. 
  Well, I may have brought the cows to water, but they coughed up the cash. 
  Well, congratulations. 
  Thank you so much. 
  I think the expression is horse to water. 
  This is amazing! 
  We doubled their expectations! 
  You made Jazmin very happy tonight, and me too. 
  I love all my grandchildren. 
  Don't turn your back on family, and, uh, you don't have to understand everything to accept it. 
  I have, and I will continue to. 
  And hopefully one day, they'll see that Jazmin had no choice, but you do. 
  You can choose to be with a woman. 
  You can choose not to break your parents' hearts. 
  You came out to our parents? 
  Yeah. 
  So what are you doing for all the major holidays? 
  Hey. 
  Why are you hanging out in here? 
  The party's over, isn't it? 
  Look, I'm sorry I didn't tell you that I joined BLM but I know how you feel about my activism. 
  I don't I don't judge you activism. 
  I mean, if anything, you You judge mine. 
  Like, I know you think I don't get it. 
  Or I'm not woke because the way I resist is different from yours. 
  But I give back to my people. 
  And I'm a successful black man. 
  And to me, that's part of the revolution. 
  You're right. 
  I'm sorry. 
  And I don't mean to judge you, ever. 
  Look, I want you to be who you want to be. 
  I just get concerned for your safety. 
  Because you're my woman. 
  - I'm your woman? 
  - Yeah, you're my woman. 
  - You my man? 
  - Yeah. 
  Oh. 
  Uh, sorry. 
  I don't mean to stop the love. 
  I just I gotta grab a jacket. 
  - How'd it go tonight? 
  - Uh, not bad. 
  - Um, I'll walk you out. 
  - Okay. 
  Don't leave, okay? 
  - Okay. 
  - Okay? 
  So I will talk to my manager at Duoro tomorrow about the job. 
  - Oh, dope. 
  I appreciate it. 
  - Yeah, of course. 
  I'm glad you came. 
  - Me too. 
  - Hey, Malika. 
  Sorry to bust in like this. 
  I tried calling. 
  Um is everything okay? 
  No I'm I'm being evicted. 
  Uh, who is this? 
  Um um, this This is our dad. 
  Dom? 
  Hey, man. 
  So, this is how you got my back? 
  - Hey, wait, son - Hey, man! 
  I am not your son. 
  What? 
  Hi. 
  Hi. 
  How was Jazmin's Doble Quince? 
  It was nice. 
  Can I come in? 
  I think I'm gonna stay at my place tonight. 
  Okay, you're obviously upset. 
  What's going on? 
  Well, you obviously have a problem with my pronouns. 
  No, I don't. 
  You joked about it in your routine tonight. 
  I was joking about me, okay? 
  And how I don't really know who I am when it comes to this stuff. 
  Exactly, you don't know who you are. 
  And you have no boundaries. 
  You made up your bed with these ridiculous sheets just 'cause you didn't want to tell your mom they suck. 
  Look who's talking. 
  Are you kidding me? 
  You don't know who you are either. 
  Wow. 
  Actually, I do know who I am. 
  I'm not confused, you are. 
  Okay, fine. 
  Yes. 
  I'm a little confused, okay? 
  I don't totally get it, but I'm trying to. 
  You don't have to get it. 
  I don't expect someone who's comfortable in their gender identity to get it, but you do have to get me. 
  I'm trying to, okay? 
  But that goes both ways. 
  I'm sorry that I just came out of the closet like two minutes ago, okay? 
  I'm trying to figure out who I am as a lesbian and a comedian. 
  Do you know how hard that is? 
  I'm not a perfectly fully formed human being but I can't keep trying to convince you to be with me. 
  How's that for boundaries? 
  Not bad. 
  For a beginner. 
  I'm sorry. 
  I'm just scared. 
  What are you doing? 
  There was a mistake in the code. 
  What mistake? 
  It worked great. 
  No. 
  The app literally doubled the donations. 
  That's why we exceeded their expectations. 
  We only made $10,000, not 20. 
  Oh, sh1t. 
  Excuse me. 
  I just wanted to say goodnight. 
  And congratulations on a successful beta test. 
  Thank you. 
  Alice, I've been really burned in the past. 
  And I guess I'm just afraid that if you don't know who you are, as a lesbian, if you're exploring, it's gonna happen again. 
  Have you completely forgotten I've been burned too? 
  By Sumi. 
  With Meera. 
  I would never do that to you, what she did to me. 
  I would never want to put you through that much pain. 
  Look, I don't have to go to the queer comedy night. 
  Yes, you do. 
  You have to go check out the scene. 
  And you need to get support from other queer comics. 
  This is my issue to deal with. 
  So you're not breaking up with me? 
  - Again. 
  - No. 
  I can't. 
  'Cause I'm falling in love with you. 
  I'm falling in love with you, too. 
  So, when did you learn how to dance? 
  I could always dance. 
  Yeah, maybe the Bachata. 
  You're just jealous 'cause I got more rhythm than you. 
  Oh, yeah? 
  Yeah. 
  We'll see about that. 
  I don't expect you to invite me to every party at the Coterie. 
  I know. 
  I'm sorry. 
  Just be honest with me. 
  Okay. 
  To be honest, Gael isn't seeing Bryan anymore. 
  And he told me that if you weren't the guy for me, that he wanted to be. 
  Is that why you needed space after you quit your clerkship? 
  Partly. 
  I didn't know that Jazmin invited you tonight. 
  And the reason I didn't is because I didn't want to flaunt my choice in front of Gael at his sister's party. 
  So I'm your choice? 
  Yes. 
  In that case, um all is forgiven.
