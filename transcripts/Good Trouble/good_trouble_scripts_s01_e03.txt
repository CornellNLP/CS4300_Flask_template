 Previously on Good Trouble...   
 REPORTER:  The police shot him seven times.   
 You really believe you can make a difference?   
 REBECCA:  You're the counter-clerk.   
 He hired you to make the progressive argument   
 so he was prepared to knock it down.   
 You told your friends I'm clerking the Jamal case?   
 No one's supposed to know what cases I'm working on.   
 That's the only picture I have of us.    
 - Mom is sick. 
- For real this time?    
 Why you got to be so hard on her?    
 Who do you think you are? You've got the nerve    
 to bother the C.E.O. with some stupid app idea?    
 Pull something like that again,   
 you're gonna be unemployed.   
 - MARIANA: Hey, do you think that's him? 
- CALLIE: Who?    
 The guy we saw hooking up with Gael the other night.

 BAILIFF:  Please rise.   
 The United States District Court   
 for the central district of California is now in session,   
 the Honorable Judge Curtis Wilson presiding.   
 Calling case number   -     ,    
 Jamal Thompson versus police officers    
 Amir Turani, Lawrence Griffin,    
 and the city of Los Angeles.    
 You may be seated.    
 I'm prepared to rule on the plaintiff's  ex parte  motion    
 to prevent the city's destruction of     calls.    
 And the defense's motion to dismiss the case    
 against the officers for excessive use of force    
 in the shooting and death of Jamal Thompson.    
 REPORTER:  The police shot him seven times   
 - (GUNFIRE) 
- after he made the fateful   
 and aggressive move towards them.   
 Jamal Thompson died on the scene.   
 (POLICE SIRENS FADING)    
 So what's the deal with these     calls?    
 Jamal's family thinks that there might have been    
 some other calls that night that weren't turned over.    
 Calls that didn't describe the suspect as a black man,    
 which could show that the police    
 targeted Jamal because he was a black man    
 walking through a predominantly white neighborhood.    
 Why are they destroying the     calls at all?    
 They call it a "routine purge."    
 Well, if they didn't have anything to hide,    
 why not turn them over and then purge them?    
 Right?    
 (SIGHING) Of course...    
 this new judge might rule to dismiss the case entirely, so...    
 Morning.    
 Hey.    
 Hey.    
 So...    
 do you know Jamal's family?    
 Girl, no, we don't all know each other.    
 I'm just gonna grab a yogurt.    
 So what's the story with this new judge?    
 MALIKA: Umm...    
 Historically,    
 Judge Wilson has always sided with the police.    
 I understand emotions are running high,    
 (DOOR OPENING)    
 and after the protests at City Hall this week,    
 I expect everyone to comport themselves in a manner    
 appropriate to a court of law.    
 KELLY:  Do you know Jamal's family?   
 MALIKA:  Girl, no, we don't all know each other.

 I do.    
 But... ?    
 It's a little phallic.    
 Maybe you just have a dirty mind.    
 Maybe I do.    
 A dirty mind's a terrible thing to waste.    
 What's it called?    
 - "Nurture." 
- CALLIE:  Is that meant to be ironic?   
 Yeah, well, that's the point.     
 That the masculine can also be nurturing.   
 You sure you like it?     
 CALLIE:  Yeah.   
 Good, 'cause I'm casting it in bronze this week,     
 and it is not cheap.

 (CALLIE EXHALING) Oh, my God!     
 Wow.     
 And I have to finish three more pieces

 I don't see why you guys have to sneak around.     
 I'm sure everybody knows everybody's business here,     
 but I don't want 'em knowing mine.     
 You think they know about Bryan and Gael?     
 Davia must. She's Bryan's friend.     
 No idea.     
 MARIANA: And you're cool with just being casual?     
 I don't have time for a relationship right now.     
 Unless, of course, I get fired today.     
 Stop. You're not getting fired.     
 Judge Wilson gave you the night off,     
 it's not like you're a doctor and you're on call.     
 Yeah, well, when Rebecca tells him     
 that she wrote the bench memo,     
 at the very least he'll take me off the Jamal case.     
 Yeah, well, maybe it's for the best.     
 It'll be less awkward with Malika.     
 And if anyone's getting fired...     
 You can't get fired 'cause Davia called Alex     
 an asshole on Instagram.     
 On my Instagram.     
 Well, those guys have done much worse to you,     
 so if Alex is a jerk about it, just...     
 go to H.R.     
 Remember, you've got a lawyer, and I will cut you     
 a very good deal.     
 You haven't passed the bar yet.     
 Thanks for reminding me.     
 Hey.     
 I expect you to represent me  pro bono .     
 Ha, ha!     
 Well, historically,     
 Judge Wilson has always sided with the police.     
 Too bad we lost the other judge.     
 Oh, I gotta run!     
 - Everyone have a good day! 
- You, too!     
 BOTH: Whoa!     
 - Hey. 
- Hey.     
 See ya later.     
 So that's a thing, right?     
 Oh, they're totally hooking up.     
 Yeah, that's what I mean, that's what I thought.     
 Sure you can be seen with me?     
 As long as we don't talk about the case,     
 and you keep that jacket on.     
 (CELL PHONE BUZZES)     
 So was that your brother at the party Saturday night?     
 Jude? Yeah.     
 You seem tight.     
 Were you in foster care together?     
 Yeah, six years until we were adopted.     
 Y'all ever get split up?     
 No, we were in a bunch of homes,     
 but they always kept us together.     
 Except when I was in juvie.     
 Wait, hold up. You were in juvie?     
 Three times.     
 It's a long story.     
 One I want to hear.     
 What about you? You have any siblings?     
 Yeah, a brother, Dom. 
But they... split us.     
 Sorry.     
 Were you guys close?     
 Not really. He's close with our mom.     
 Says she's sick, wants to see me.     
 Are you in contact with her?     
 Try not to be.     
 SANDRA: Martin Luther King, Jr. said,     
 "True peace is not merely the absence of tension:     
 it is the presence of justice."     
 - See ya later? 
- See ya.     
 SANDRA: We got no justice for my son, Jamal,     
 who was shot seven times in the back     
 for doing nothing wrong.     
 The D.A. refused to bring charges     
 against the officers who murdered him.     
 So now, our only hope for justice is in federal court.     
 Judge Wilson,   
 do not allow those     calls to be destroyed     
 and do not dismiss this case.     
 Do not dismiss another mother   
 who has lost her child, her only child...     
 for no other reason than for the color of his skin.     
 - It's clear you're the one with the problem. 
- I am?     
 Yeah, you're angry that the judge gave me     
 the Jamal Thompson case.     
 Don't listen to her.     
 I'm not saying she has an agenda,     
 but being a clerk is all about trying to impress your judge,     
 so when you get an opportunity, take it.     
 CALLIE:  Judge Wilson called, like, hours ago.   
 I could get fired!     
 I appreciate you all coming back in Saturday night.     
 It's a well-written memo.     
 Who wrote it?     
 We all did. It was a group effort.     
 Well, nice teamwork.     
 MARIANA (ECHOING):  Hey, Alex! Hey, Alex! Trying you again.   
 Umm, I wanted to explain about my friend Davia.   
 How dumb are you to not come through, Alex?     
 - You giant asshole! 
- Dude!     
 MARIANA:  I think she might be on molly.   
 Give me a call when you get this... or 'shrooms!   
 I have a lot of good ideas.   
 I didn't call you an asshole.     
 I'm not sure if you saw my text.   
 ... really fun to hang out with.   
 We can talk Monday. I'd love to talk about this more.   
 Sorry about all the calls...    
 - Hi, Alex! 
- Hey, Mariana! Have a nice weekend?     
 Uh, yeah.     
 Hey.     
 I... your party looked rad. I really wanted to come.     
 Yeah, it was... it was poppin'.     
 Sorry we didn't make it. Alex was really into the whole     
 Guys' Night thing.     
 So like every other night?     
 Well, Sam passed out.     
 I'm starting to think he's narcoleptic.     
 And, uh, Alex dropped a bunch     
 of sad pick-up lines all night, so...     
 So, yeah, yeah, pretty much.     
 JOSH: Blue team, blue team, blue team,     
 let's scrum here today. Let's do this.     
 Hey man, what's up? What's up! Hey, how's it going?     
 So Evan wanted me to start     
 by giving my man, Alex here, a little shout-out.     
 Dude, Evan's legit stoked     
 about your user-customizable photo filters app idea.     
 We could incorporate photo filters in the eGIFany app.     
 It's gonna rock the new app so hard.     
 Thanks, man.     
 We'll get started refactoring the code     
 and improve build time     
 and testing through a three-week sprint.     
 JOSH: I love it! Evan's gonna love it!     
 You guys rock! Get back to work.     
 Okay, uh, we'll divide between Sam and Raj the back-end classes.     
 Mariana, you handle front-end.     
 All right? Go blue team!     
 - Ah! 
- Yeah boy!     
 Blue team!     
 - Hey, Alex? 
- Hey, Mari-anne-a.     
 - Mari-ah-na. 
- Oh, sorry.     
 The customizable filters was my idea.     
 - You sure? 
- Yeah.     
 I pitched it to you in the voicemail?     
 During my party?     
 Huh, you left me a voicemail?     
 A couple.     
 That's weird, I didn't get 'em.     
 Great minds, right Mari-anne-a?     
 Now let's get back to work.     
 You know, I wish the press     
 would use that photo of Jamal,     
 but I'm not surprised they don't.     
 Why they got to make him out to look like a criminal     
 in every picture when he's the victim?     
 You're the girl that's been tweeting     
 about the case all week.     
 - You got all these people here. 
- Some of them.     
 I mean, people are good with the retweets,     
 but showing up...     
 - that's not so easy. 
- I know.     
 When Jamal first got killed,     
 people took to the streets.     
 But it's been five years,     
 and with a new shooting every month,     
 people forget by the time the case gets to court.     
 If it gets to court.     
 I won't forget.     
 Thank you.     
 (INAUDIBLE)     
 I can see there's four paladins.     
 - I see you. 
- Why aren't you the dwarf?     
 - I'm the mage. 
- You're, well...     
 - Why aren't you the dwarf? 
- Because I'm a paladin.     
 RAJ: I'm telling you, there's four dragons around.     
 ALEX: Well, no, you hold on...     
 SAM: Fireball!     
 ALEX: Can you hold on two sec... ?     
 Can we actually plan out something, please?     
 Well, why are there dragons charging in?

 Need to borrow my invisibility cloak?     
 Why didn't you tell Wilson you wrote the memo?     
 Because, in spite of what you think,     
 I'm not a backstabbing bitch.     
 I don't think that.     
 Isn't that what your best friend, Ben, told you?     
 I couldn't be trusted     
 because I was born with a silver spoon up my ass.     
 That's not exactly how he put it.     
 (LAUGHING) Oh.     
 Look...     
 Ben turned the last clerk against me,     
 and it would be nice     
 if we could have each other's backs, right?     
 Yeah.     
 Thanks for having mine.     
 Well, don't be too grateful.     
 I wrote a conservative opinion     
 recommending against the injunction on purging the     calls.     
 Which is exactly what I would have written.     
 - Really? 
- I'm not gonna be the counter-clerk.     
 I'm not gonna be used to knock down the progressive argument.     
 I'm only writing from his perspective from now on.     
 Makes sense.     
 Judge wants to see me.     
 D... did you really accost Evan in the elevator?     
 I did not accost him.     
 Umm...     
 Excuse me?     
 Mr. Speck?     
 I just...     
 asked him if I could pitch him a few app ideas.     
 Your second day on the job.     
 Look, you have to pay your dues.     
 Eventually, you will get your chance to impress Evan.     
 I already did.     
 Apparently, he's super stoked about an idea that I had,     
 but Alex took credit for it.     
 At least you had an idea that was worth stealing.     
 You gotta be patient.     
 Work harder than the boys,     
 and eventually you'll get noticed for it.     
 And, hey, in the meantime,     
 make a few allies.     
 Not every guy here is a jerk.     
 Mystic Mango?     
 Isn't that your favorite?     
 Yeah, um, it is.

 Unless Malika's involved with the actual case

 Look, Callie, as your lawyer and your friend,     
 don't underestimate yourself

 Trust your ability to make a compelling argument     
 and you might just have an impact on Judge Wilson.

 Write the memo.

 Thank you.

 Cool. Oh, look who's here...     
 Our fearless leader.     
 All right, everyone. Uh, good work...     
 and, oh, congrats to blue team     
 for completing all three phases of the code refactoring.     
 Alex, your team is killing it this week.     
 Who's the man... who's the man?     
 Uh, I guess I am.     
 That's right. Everyone else take note,     
 Alex is raising the bar for the other team leaders.     
 Okay?     
 So let's get out of here and, uh, get back to work.     
 - Sorry, Raj. 
- All right.     
 - What happened to your phone? 
- Dropped it.     
 Isn't that the girl I told you about in the elevator?     
 I thought she had an app to pitch me.     
 Yeah, yeah, uh...     
 I reached out to her. She never got back to me, so...     
 Hey, you completed all three phases?     
 Yeah, I finished my work,     
 so I thought I'd take the initiative.     
 Oh, you thought.     
 Now they're going to expect us to deliver this fast every time.     
 Well, we can.     
 This time, yeah, maybe.     
 What happens if we get a more challenging build next week, huh?     
 - We're screwed. 
- Yeah.     
 Look, I don't give a crap if you think I'm an asshole     
 or what you tell your druggy friends about me.     
 I'm team leader.     
 I assign the work and the time that it takes.     
 He's the leader.     
 Maybe I need to go to Angela     
 and tell her you can't take direction.     
 Huh?     
 Hey, sorry about those guys.     
 Those guys?     
 What about you?     
 You go along with his bullshit all the time.     
 You know, being a nice guy behind his back     
 doesn't make you a hero.     
 Thank you for the opportunity to rewrite this, your honor.     
 I think I managed to keep emotion out of it.     
 What's your recommendation?     
 To grant the plaintiff's motion for an injunction     
 against the destruction of the     calls.     
 No surprise there. On what basis?     
 The doctrine of spoliation should prevent     
 the destruction of potential evidence.     
 If the court finds it as a duty to preserve the evidence.     
 In  Brookshire Brothers v. Aldridge ...     
 Which was reversed by the Texas Supreme Court.     
 Only for the harshness of the verdict,     
 not the merit of the argument.     
 Which is in relevance to this case.     
 They refused to turn over all the security footage     
 to show the conditions of Aldridge's injury.     
 Exactly. Video footage.     
 The bodycam footage in the Jamal Thompson case isn't in question.     
 - Yet... they haven't turned it over. 
- Well let's not get ahead of ourselves,     
 the video footage will provide conditions     
 of the shooting of Jamal Thompson.     
 The     calls are tangential.     
 In  Smith v. Superior Court ...     
 Superseded by  Cedar Sinai v. Superior Court .     
 Your Honor, if you're not gonna consider my arguments,     
 am I just here to help prepare you     
 to shoot down the progressive argument?     
 What do you mean?     
 Did you hire me to be your counter-clerk?     
 (CHUCKLES)     
 You think I need a kid     
 straight out of a five-year undergrad UC law school     
 to prepare me for the liberal argument?     
 You're here because I like to spar...     
 and teach young legal dilettantes     
 how to formulate well-reasoned arguments,     
 regardless of your misguided politics and belief     
 that the Constitution is a living document you can manipulate     
 into making law instead of interpreting it.     
 Uh, so you can relax.     
 You're in no danger of arming me     
 with some liberal legal kryptonite     
 that I wouldn't already be well aware of.     
 Oh, and, uh...     
 the simple recommendation is to have me listen     
 to all the     calls and cameras you assess     
 if relevant evidence is being withheld.     
 And even though you failed to present that option,     
 I'll consider it in my ruling this afternoon.     
 FEMALE REPORTER:  The judge is going to rule on the     calls first.   
 If he rules against the plaintiffs,   
 it would indicate he doesn't believe there's merit to the case.   
 And many legal experts predict   
 he'll then rule on behalf of the defendants to dismiss the case.   
 MALE REPORTER:  If he does, with protesters outside City Hall,   
 the police are on high alert,   
 hoping to prevent the crowd from erupting into violence.   
 JUDGE WILSON: Upon reviewing the plaintiff's  ex parte  motion...     
 I rule to deny their motion to prevent     
 the destruction of the reported     calls     
 due to lack of relevance.
