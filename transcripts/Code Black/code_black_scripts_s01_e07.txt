 Driver ploughed his car through a street festival. 
 Oh my God. She's the driver. 
 Arrest her! She's a criminal! She killed my daughter! 
 Get him out of here! 
 Man : "Scrape the gauze to the wound." Please confirm. 
 No, I said "tape"... 
 "Tape the gauze to the wound," not scrape it. Copy? 
 Ah. 
 I mean, I'm literally not gonna stand up all night. 
 You're not gonna do any big medicine, either. 
 Even God needed to chillax for a day. 
 Angel's base. Angel's base. Incoming ground-level fall. 
 Vitals stable. No visible deformities. 
 [ Siren wailing ] 
 C-collar, back board, then load and go. Over. 
 Copy that. 
 Don't tear something. Enjoy. 
 Woman : Angel's base, this is 9-1-1 dispatch. 
 Get ready over there. 
 We're transferring calls to you now. 
 Some kind of street-fair accident. 
 We're getting slammed. 
 Car ran them down. At least 10 victims, maybe more. 
 This is Angel's base. Did you say 10 victims? 
 Full amputation. Hemorrhage. 
 Man : Transferring to your facility. 
 Cervical step-off. He... 
 Angel's base, 24-year-old female with auto-ped. 
 This is Angel's base. I did not read you. 
 Please repeat. Over. 
 [ Radio static ] Uh, minor lacerations... 
 Can't locate... legs. 
 Angel's base, vehicle versus ped. 
 You what? You... 
 We've got an open wound. 
 You can't locate the what? 
 Can't locate the legs. 
 The legs? 
 <i>Bystanders report a driver plowed his car through a street festival in downtown Los Angeles. 
 At least four are dead on the scene with at least a dozen more injured, some seriously.</i> 
 Try again. Legs need to be in a full tourniquet. Copy? 
 10 milligrams of morphine. 
 Please repeat. 
 Center stage is cleared out. 
 We're ready. How far out are they? 
 First rig should be here any minute. 
 Dr. Rorish, they're asking me to pronounce. 
 Vitals? B.P. Zero over zero. 
 Go ahead. 
 Go ahead? Over the radio? 
 If you agree with their assessment. 
 Man : Repeating. B.P. Zero over zero. 
 Okay to pronounce? 
 Son... answer them. 
 Angel's base, Rescue 4. 
 Okay, Angel's base. 
 Okay to pronounce. Time of death... 7:18 P.M. 
 [ Sirens wailing ] They're here. 
 Okay. Uh, you did good, but your radio shift is over. 
 You're needed on the floor. 
 We all are. Come on. 
 [ Sirens continue ] 
 Jesse : Bed three, center stage. 
 They're coming in now. We're gonna have to move you. 
 [ Indistinct radio chatter] 
 Bed four, please. 
 Okay, center stage right away. 
 Woman : Right here. Right here. 
 What do you got? 
 32-year-old female pedestrian, 20 minutes extrication time. 
 Massive deformity to both legs. 
 Ebl at least one liter. B.P. 70 over palp. 
 Skids are down. All right. 
 You ready? 
 On my count. 1, 2, 3. 
 All right. Stryker out, please. 
 All right, we're gonna roll her. 
 Okay. 
 Ready? 1, 2... 
 Blood is here. 
 Grab her head. 
 Doctor! 
 Let's put her down. 
 What's this? 
 Her legs. 
 Savetti, what are you doing? 
 It was a mess out there. 
 Jesse : Savetti, come on! 
 Get her down here. All right. 
 Dr. Leighton, drop that and join me and Dr. Savetti, please. 
 Come on. 
 Yes. Drop it. 
 Her legs are useless if she bleeds out. And get over here. 
 All right, clamp, please. Let's clamp this blood here. 
 Thank you, Jesse. 
 I need some more gauze, please. We need a lot of gauze, please. 
 50-year-old male. Auto-ped. Same accident. 
 Launched about 30 feet from the scene. 
 Miss, were you injured? 
 Non-ambulatory, repetitive questioning on arrival. 
 No, no, he pushed me out of the way. 
 Dr. Pineda. 
 John, I love you. 
 I'm right here, okay? I'm right... 
 I need you to wait in the waiting room for me. 
 I'll come and find you when I know more. 
 Right here. 
 I love you, John. 
 We need some more Kellys in here! 
 Dr. Savetti, I want you to clamp it high. 
 Yeah. 
 And as deep as you can. 
 You got it. 
 We lost the airway. 
 Grab me another one. 
 She was found walking on scene. 
 Pressure's dropping. 
 Okay, Dr. Leighton, get a pulse, please. 
 Thready. No, it's, uh... it's, uh... 
 It's, uh... 
 She's pulseless. 
 Okay, Dr. Leighton, start compressions, please. 
 One of epinephrine. One of bicarb. 
 Is everything running wide open? 
 Yes, through three lines. 
 [ Echoing ] Dr. Savetti, start another high line, please. 
 [ Breathing heavily ] She's bleeding out. 
 We need some more clamps. We need some more gauze. 
 Mario! Subclavian line, please! 
 Yeah. Yeah. 
 Come on. 
 Okay, I need a subclavian kit. 
 Clamp it down. 
 We need more units. 
 Ohh! 
 [ Grunting ] 
 [ Flatline ] 
 Rhythm check? 
 [ Grunting ] 
 I'm going to call it. 
 Time of death... 7:28 P.M. 
 She was a strong woman to have made it this far. 
 Good job. 
 What do you got? 
 40-year-old female. 
 Belted, airbags deployed, causing facial injuries. 
 Found confused walking on scene. 
 Oh, my God. 
 She's the driver. 
 I.D.'d by a couple of eyewitnesses. 
 Cops are champing at the bit to question her. 
 Here, this is Dr. Leighton. 
 He's been taking care of Nancy Smith, the driver in the accident. 
 She has a seizure disorder. 
 She never should have been behind the wheel. 
 Wait. Wait. Did you say a seizure disorder? 
 How do you know that? 
 Her license was suspended because of it. 
 I need to speak with her. 
 I'm sorry, but we need to run some more tests. 
 You're a resident, correct? 
 Yes, sir. 
 You're gonna let a resident decide whether or not I can question a suspect in a quadruple homicide? 
 She's not going anywhere. 
 You can post anyone you want here, but she doesn't speak until her doctor says she does. 
 All right. Thanks, doc. 
 Leanne : Do you think she had a seizure? 
 Makes sense. If that's the case, her memory loss would be psychogenic amnesia. 
 And I wrote a paper on it in grad school. 
 Or she's lying. 
 I've studied all the journal articles on dissociation. 
 Have you? No. 
 She's not faking it. 
 Occam's razor... 
 Usually, the simplest explanation is the right one. 
 Seizure is likely. Amnesia is likely. 
 She cannot find out what happened from the man who wants to put her away. 
 It would send her into a grief spiral. 
 We need someone from psych. 
 That's what I came to tell you. They don't have anyone tonight. 
 I mean, they're paging people, but it's not gonna happen. 
 Okay, Angus, you are the best qualified for this right now. 
 What do I do? 
 She's your patient. Treat her. 
 Keep me posted. What do we got? 
 When this poor woman realizes what she's done... 
 Poor woman? 
 After I'm finished sewing this guy up, I'm gonna fill out a death certificate on another one of her victims. 
 If she's sick, she's not responsible. 
 Was she responsible when she decided to drive today? 
 Man : [ Shouting indistinctly ] 
 Get off of me! 
 I'm am American! 
 Where's the justice?! You're not help... 
 You into basketball, Malaya? 
 Why? Because I'm a lesbian? 
 Do lesbians like basketball? 
 This one does. [ Chuckles ] 
 Then you'll get it when I say that all this charting is like asking Lebron to record his own stats while he plays. 
 [ Man shouting indistinctly ] 
 Evening. What's the word? 
 Lesbians like basketball. 
 Good to know. 
 Man : I will sue! 
 Get off of me! 
 All right, all right. Let's settle this guy down. 
 Man : I take them every day! 
 Uh, Dr. Lorenson, there's a woman over there who could use your help. 
 Did she check in yet? 
 No. She's working up the nerve. 
 But she's been here a while. 
 And when they want to pay in cash, there's usually a reason. 
 Okay. [ Police radio chatter ] 
 Hi. I'm Dr. Lorenson. 
 Please, help my son. [ Wheezing ] 
 No, no, no, no, no. No, that's not necessary. 
 I'm gonna need you to fill these out. 
 Oh, no. Please, um, no papers. 
 [ Woman speaking indistinctly over P.A. ] 
 [ Wheezing continues ] 
 Okay. Hi. What's your name? 
 His name is Pablo. 
 Hola, Pablo. 
 Having trouble breathing? 
 Chest feel tight? 
 [ Wheezing continues ] 
 Okay. 
 We have some medicine that's gonna help make you feel better, okay? 
 Looks like there's a bleed. 
 Yeah. We didn't get properly introduced earlier. 
 I'm Dr. Rorish. 
 Veronica Franco, ma'am. It's my right eye. 
 [ Chuckling ] Yeah. 
 I can see that. 
 The muscles in your eye are entrapped. 
 It's like someone's slowly dimming the lights. 
 We have minimal pupil reactmty. 
 The blood is behind the eye, compressing the optic nerve. 
 We need to make an incision to release the pressure. 
 What do you do for a living? I'm in the military, training to be a pilot. Why? 
 That takes a lot of courage. 
 Yeah. 
 Good. 
 We don't have time for general anesthesia, only local. 
 The problem is you could lose vision in that eye permanently if we don't do this right now. 
 I need both my eyes to fly. Let's go. 
 All right. 
 Christa : Your son has a lung infection, but we've drained the infected fluid, and we put him on antibiotics. 
 How you feeling? 
 Okay. 
 Has he had pneumonia before? 
 Yes, a lot. It's cause of the asthma. 
 I get inhalers when we can pay for them. 
 When did he start losing weight? 
 Oh, it's the other way around. 
 He hasn't been able to gain it. 
 [ Grunts ] 
 Does that hurt, Pablo? 
 Yes. 
 Can you... make him better? 
 That's what I'm here for. 
 [ Woman speaking indistinctly over P.A. ] 
 What are you doing? 
 I don't think your son has asthma. 
 Pablo, I have some games on here. 
 Want me to leave it with you while I talk to your mom? 
 <i>¿Tienes un juego con carros?</i> 
 Oh, he [Chuckles] loves cars and trucks. 
 Oh, um... 
 Any game is fine. 
 Pablo... say "thank you." 
 Thank you. 
 I told you, I could not have been in a car accident. 
 I never left my house. 
 I know this is difficult for you. 
 You're blocking out an event that's too painful for you to remember. 
 We believe you're experiencing a type of temporary amnesia. 
 Let's say I were to b... 
 Amy : Excuse me. 
 Uh, Dr. Leighton, lab called. They need more blood in five. 
 Sample hemolyzed. 
 Okay. Thank you. I'm sorry about that. 
 Let's say I were to believe this fantasy. 
 Were people injured in this accident? 
 Yes, people were injured. 
 Seriously injured? 
 Nancy, first, let me tell you that this is... 
 Did people die? 
 Yes. I'm afraid there were casualties. 
 Dr. Leighton. 
 Nancy, are you beginning to remember? 
 How many people died? 
 Four. 
 Children? 
 Nancy, listen to me. You had a seizure. 
 That's why you accelerated involuntarily. 
 Were there children? 
 A 12-year-old girl, yes. 
 Oh, God. 
 Ugh. This is absurd. 
 You have this all wrong. I-I did not do that. 
 I could not have done that. 
 Nancy. 
 The last thing I remember... 
 Was making breakfast. 
 I-I felt funny, so I laid down on the sofa. 
 I was asleep on the sofa! 
 How could I be driving if I'm asleep?! 
 Tell me that! Can you explain that to me?! 
 No, of course you can't. 
 [ Scoffs ] Idiots! 
 You're all idiots! 
 [ Breathes sharply ] 
 [ Monitor beeping ] 
 Can you walk me through this? 
 Might as well know what's going on. 
 Okay. 
 I'm injecting the side of your eye socket with Lidocaine. 
 Hemostats. 
 Now I'm moving your skin to expose the orbital rim. 
 I'm gonna hold the clamp there for a few seconds. 
 You're doing great. 
 I've gone through boot camp. This is nothing. 
 Now I'm taking the scissors to dissect the skin and tissue. 
 And I'm looking for a taut little rubber band-like tendon known as the lateral canthus. 
 And there it is. 
 Stay still. 
 Don't blink. 
 [ Squelches ] 
 There it goes. 
 Did it work? 
 Well, it's starting to look normal again, but it will be a few hours before we know if your full sight will return. 
 Okay, bandage her up. 
 Your son is in the zero percentile in weight. 
 He has abdominal sensitivity, chronic lung infections. 
 That's why I tasted his sweat. 
 It's very salty, which is consistent with cystic fibrosis. 
 I'm calling the lab to confirm. 
 What is that? 
 It's a manageable disease, but it requires a lot of attention. 
 Hi. This is Dr. Lorenson. I need to... 
 Yeah, I'll hold. 
 Uh, what kind of attention? 
 We need to discuss your options. 
 You're not here legally, are you? 
 But my son is American. 
 I used to work for a family in L.A. 
 And... 
 I made [Chuckles] a terrible mistake with my employer. 
 He's Pablo's father. 
 He fired me when I told him I was pregnant. 
 Does anyone else know your former employer is Pablo's father? 
 His mother did... Pablo's grandmother. 
 She could tell. 
 She's a good lady. But what can she do, right? 
 You, um... 
 You cannot send Pablo away if he is American, yes? 
 We can't, and we would not send him away, no matter who he is or where he's from. 
 Then I come to the right place. 
 45-year-old male with a priapism... 
 Too many little blue pills. 
 It's been five hours. 
 And an 83-year-old female with a fractured femur and a propensity of handing out butterscotch candies. 
 You're kidding me. 
 You heard what just came in, right? 
 A mass-casualty incident, little old lady, and a 45-year-old male with priapism. 
 He needs a shot of terbutaline. 
 Well, can't he just... 
 You know? 
 No. That's the whole point. 
 .5 milligrams, please. 
 Who gets which patient? 
 I'll let you two decide. 
 Flip a coin? 
 Hey. 
 Hey. 
 How you doing? 
 Not good. Uh, not good at all. 
 I'm gonna give you a shot. 
 Where? 
 Your arm. 
 Thank God. 
 I, uh... 
 [ Sighs ] 
 I'm gonna need to see it, okay? 
 Why? And what do you care? 
 Just give me the shot. 
 I need a point of comparison. 
 Freaking nightmare. 
 Doesn't get any worse than this. 
 No, it doesn't. 
 I was buying myself some funnel cake when that lady drove up on the sidewalk... 
 Made a mess of my leg. 
 You have a bad fracture. 
 If you're gonna regain function in your leg, you'll need surgery. 
 Sign me up. 
 It's not that simple. 
 First, I'll need to get a surgeon to sign off on it, and you have certain risk factors that we have to consider. 
 Angela : John, please stay in bed. 
 I'm fine. 
 Y-you're not fine. 
 For one, you have emphysema. 
 I smoked for 40 years. 
 I'm no quitter. 
 And you're advanced in age. 
 Older than Egypt. 
 Doctor! Can I get a doctor over here, please? 
 Mr. Harris, you need to stop moving. 
 Nobody touch him, please. Jesse, you get the collar. 
 [ Grunts ] 
 Sir, look, we need to put this on you. 
 You cut through my pants. What am I supposed to wear home? 
 Mr. Harris, just keep still for us, please, okay? 
 I need to go back to work. 
 The accident... Has it been on the news yet? 
 You need to listen to us, okay? 
 Angela : John, stop. Do as they say. 
 Mr. Harris, you have a fracture in your spine. 
 If you move even a millimeter, you could be paralyzed permanently. 
 [ Breathing heavily ] 
 That's ridiculous. I feel fine. 
 You're not fine, John. You're not fine. 
 Listen to us for a second. 
 Dorothy, I need you to understand what I just said. 
 [ Monitor beeping rapidly ] 
 Nurse! Nurse, something is happening! 
 Dr. Lorenson! 
 Please help him. I think he's pain. 
 Hey, buddy, what happened? 
 Okay, take a big breath in for me. 
 Chest tube drain is intact. Water seal is still working. 
 He's not moving any air on his right. 
 Ultrasound, please. 
 Please give me my glasses, Angela. Please. 
 Stop moving now! 
 Nice and easy, okay? Nice and easy. 
 Nice and easy. Okay? 
 There you go. 
 [ Groans ] We've got you. 
 [ Grunting ] 
 I shouldn't be here. 
 This is the only place you should be. Okay? 
 Dorothy, I need you to acknowledge and understand what I just said. 
 Is that boy all right? 
 He's with a very good doctor. 
 Dorothy, do you understand? 
 Yes, yes. I'm old, so the tube you put down my throat for surgery might never come out. 
 Basically. 
 [ Sighs ] 
 Without the surgery? 
 You won't be able to walk. 
 Oh, you're full of sunshine, doc. 
 Oh, that poor mother over there. 
 She must be terrified. 
 Christa : Normal lung slide. No collapsed lung. 
 Chest tube is working. It's got to be bronchial. 
 He has a mucus plug. He needs a bronchoscopy. 
 Pablo needs a procedure that's gonna clear his airway, but we have to move him right now. 
 Center stage... Clear a bed! 
 Will he be okay? 
 Tell me he will be okay! 
 Pablo will be fine. I promise. 
 Pablo, please don't make me a liar. 
 Leanne : Run it down for me, please. 
 It's C.F., slam dunk. 
 All the signs are there... Chronic URIs, malnourished. 
 Had to drain an empyema earlier. 
 On your own? 
 I thought I could do it. 
 Well, you did do it. Sweat test? 
 Positive. Lab just called. 
 He's probably clogged the right mainstem. 
 Risa, call pulm. 
 Tell them we got a bronch. 
 I can do it. 
 Got it. 
 I spent a lot of time in the pulm lab when my son was sick. 
 After med school, they let me work there. 
 I've seen it done a million times. 
 I want you to be careful here. 
 What do you mean? 
 Don't personalize this. 
 I'm not. I can do it. 
 [ Monitor beeping rapidly ] 
 He's desatting. Pulse ox into 70s. 
 Free me the monitor. Thank you. 
 Okay, Christa, you drive. 
 Okay. 
 All right. 
 To the cords. 
 More suction. 
 You give a little more versed? 
 Yes. 
 And now, Christa, let's see the right mainstem. 
 There's the block. 
 [ Scope clicks ] 
 And... gone. 
 [ Exhales sharply ] 
 [ Monitor beeping ] 
 A surgeon agreed to do your surgery, as long as you understand the risks. 
 I know it's a tough decision, so... 
 Oh, honey, popcorn or junior mints is a tough decision. 
 [ Chuckles ] I just want a shot at walking out of here on my own two feet. 
 Dorothy, it's more than walking or not walking. 
 There's a chance you might not wake up from the surgery. 
 [ Sighs ] Listen, kid, me and 10 girlfriends started a book club about 40 years ago. 
 Do you know how many of us are left? 
 Two. Me and Marie. 
 She picked "Atlas Freakin' Shrugged" to read this time. [ Chuckles ] 
 Now, I read the whole damn thing. 
 Well, it's not good enough to kill a bug with. 
 [ Laughs ] 
 There is no way that I read that thing for nothing. 
 I'm not gonna die today. 
 Do you want Marie with you? I can call her. 
 No, I-I don't want to bother her. 
 I'll do this on my own. 
 I'll be with you. 
 Don't look so worried. It worked. 
 It's just a band-aid. 
 If his mother tries to get him long-term treatment here, she'll get deported and she'll have to take him with her. 
 We're the first 10 minutes, Christa... that's all. 
 He's a sick little boy. 
 And we saved his life, because that's what we do. 
 We plug their holes and stitch them up and send them on. 
 We don't follow our patients home. 
 I promised his mother he'd be okay. 
 I don't feel like I'm keeping my promise. 
 Part of learning this job is learning where it ends. 
 
 
 
 [ Door opens ] 
 Injection didn't work on Casanova. 
 He's still, uh... Locked and loaded. 
 I'll be back to check on you. 
 If the shot of terbutaline failed, the next step is a shot of phenylephrine. 
 How about I just give him a shot of jaeger and some magazines? 
 Dr. Savetti, I'm sensing you don't like the Rick Biddenger case. 
 Would you prefer to pass it off to another resident? 
 A fasciotomy just came in. 
 I'd be psyched to jump on that instead. 
 You're not assigned cases to get you psyched. 
 You're assigned them to make the patients healthy. 
 Now, get the phenylephrine, and inject it into that man's corpus. 
 Not in his arm? 
 Moving on from the arm. 
 Got it. 
 Shot in the corpus. His erect corpus. 
 Dr. Hudson, I need you right now. 
 [ Monitor beeping rapidly ] 
 Excuse me. 
 What's wrong? 
 His pressure hasn't changed, but... 
 He has warm extremities. 
 Spinal shock? 
 Yeah. He needs an O.R. 
 Page neurosurgery, please. 
 What does that mean? I-is he dying? 
 No. No, no. He's not dying. 
 But what's happening is very serious. 
 Swelling is causing John's fracture to compress his spinal cord. 
 He needs surgery right away if we're to preserve function. 
 Oh, God, baby. 
 Easy on the pressure there. 
 Mrs. Harris, do we have your consent for surgery? 
 I'm not Mrs. Harris. 
 You need to call Susan... Susan Harris. 
 She's his wife. 
 Doctor, I heard my Pablo is being discharged. 
 Uh, yes. His symptoms are improving. 
 He's stable now. 
 No, you can't. 
 He needs more than this one visit. 
 Yeah, there are several organizations that we could put you in touch with. 
 They will deport us. 
 Do you... have any children? 
 There are limits to what we can do for you here, okay? 
 I am terribly sorry. 
 I-I-if you... 
 If you had children, you would know. 
 You don't know your... your true purpose until you hold their tiny hand in yours. 
 Your son is a U.S. citizen? 
 Yes. 
 Does he have any family here, any family at all? 
 He has a father, but he won't help. 
 I'm begging you, miss doctor... 
 <i>Lo siento mucho.</i> 
 There is nothing more I can do. 
 I'll check back in, okay? Everything's gonna be fine. 
 Hey, doc, when's she gonna be ready for me to talk to her? 
 Could still be a while. 
 Right now, she doesn't remember anything. 
 Trust me, doc... 
 None of them can remember what they did. 
 I know, but right now, she seems to be experiencing a genuine mental break. 
 Are you a psychiatrist, doc? 
 I was a psych resident. 
 That's her. 
 You're her! You're the one that did this. 
 You're the one that hit me! 
 Oh, my God. Get him out of here. 
 You're the one who's responsible for all of this! 
 Here. Okay, sir. 
 Sir, sir, sir. 
 Arrest her! 
 Please, calm down. Please... please... 
 She's a criminal! 
 Please, just step away. 
 You should be putting her away! She's dangerous! 
 Step away. Please. 
 You almost killed my daughter! 
 What are you talking to me for?! 
 Angus : Breathe in. Just breathe. 
 She hit a dozen people with her car! 
 Get him out of here! 
 I can't imagine how this must feel. 
 People died, didn't they? 
 Yes. 
 You told me that already, didn't you? 
 Nancy, you're experiencing a temporary loss of memory. 
 Your brain is protecting you by blocking out what actually happened. 
 [ Sighs ] 
 [ Crying ] I'm a murderer, aren't I? 
 Let me give you something to calm you down. 
 No. [ Sniffles ] 
 No. I'm... I'm allowed to refuse medication, right? 
 Yes, but I really think it'll help. 
 Please, just leave me alone. 
 Nancy. 
 [ Sniffles ] 
 [ Sighs ] 
 You've treated me very well, Dr. Leighton. 
 Please, I... 
 I would just like to be alone now. 
 Dr. Hudson, Mrs. Harris is here, the C-spine's wife? 
 The real wife. 
 Mrs. Harris, I'm Dr. Hudson. 
 Yes. You'd called me about my husband, John? 
 Yeah. I'm sorry to meet you under these circumstances. 
 Your husband fractured two of his spinal vertebrae. 
 The fragments may have irreparably damaged his spinal cord. 
 He was struck by a car. 
 Where... Where did this happen? 
 He had a deposition in Santa Barbara today. 
 It happened in downtown L.A. 
 Mrs. Harris, your husband needs surgery on his spine. 
 Downtown L.A.? No, that's impossible. 
 He's in Santa Barbara. 
 Mrs. Harris, you need to listen to me. 
 Your husband needs surgery right away, but we need your consent on his behalf. 
 He's too altered to sign. 
 Was he alone? 
 There were many people injured. 
 Was he alone... yes or no? 
 [ Scoffs ] 
 Of course. 
 You're even tacky enough to be right here when I arrive? 
 Susan, I'm sorry. 
 I just didn't want him to be alone. 
 Well, that's not why you should be sorry. 
 Uh, Mrs. Harris, we need to operate right away. 
 I'm... I'm gonna go now. 
 No! No. You sit right there. 
 [ Sniffles ] 
 What happens to him if I don't consent? 
 Susan, please. 
 It's very likely he won't walk again. 
 He may never even be able to breathe on his own again. 
 [ Sighs ] 
 You ready for that, Angela? 
 You ready to feed him, bathe him, diaper him? 
 This can't be right. 
 She can't be in charge of what happens to him, can she? 
 John and I each have a living will. 
 Did you know that? 
 No, you wouldn't. 
 It's something that we did when we formed our family trust. 
 [ Chuckling ] What they call it... 
 A family trust. 
 Do you believe that? 
 I'm the one he decided to choose what happens to him if he's incapacitated. 
 [ Monitor beeping ] 
 [ Baby crying ] 
 There's no time to get a court order. 
 He won't make it that long. 
 But he'll live, right? 
 You're condemning him to a lifetime of paralysis. 
 In point of fact, I'm not doing anything. 
 He's the one who made the decisions that put him here. 
 He's the one who decided to be who he is. 
 And you get to decide who you are. 
 Is this who you are? 
 [ Sighs ] 
 You're still here for a reason. 
 You and Marie have been friends a long time. 
 What's your secret? 
 The secret of any great relationship is to hate the same people. 
 [ Chuckles ] 
 Prep etomidate and sux. 
 What's your favorite book? 
 "Wizard of Oz." 
 [ Chuckling ] I'm not Dorothy by accident. 
 It was my mother's favorite book, too. 
 She always felt that the witch of the east died too young. 
 She was right, of course. 
 We all die too young. 
 Just close your eyes and relax. 
 Hard to close my eyes when I might not wake up. 
 Just click your heels, Dorothy. 
 My Arthur used that line on me. 
 The injection didn't work. 
 So, what's next? 
 Aspiration. 
 Good. Talk me through it. 
 Two incisions. 
 Where? 
 The head. 
 Can you be more specific? 
 Not really. 
 At the base of the glands. 
 Do you want me to draw you a diagram? 
 No, I'm good. 
 A deep incision, all the way down to the corpus. Why? 
 So the blood can drain out like a shunt. 
 Right, but you, uh... You need to aid the shunt. 
 Squeeze upwards. 
 [ Chuckles ] 
 Are you serious? 
 Do you have a problem with that? 
 [ Chuckling ] Yeah. 
 I didn't put myself through medical school so I can give some guy a reach-around. 
 This isn't emergency medicine, man. 
 Would you, uh, excuse me? 
 [ Sighs ] 
 You know that man could have serious organ damage unless you treat him. 
 Is that emergent enough for you? 
 You're not better than him, Mario. 
 You know, we're not better than any of them. 
 We all have moments when we need the help of another human being. 
 The only difference between you and him is that, today, he's the one asking. 
 [ Monitor beeping ] 
 Follow me. 
 You really need to learn some manners. 
 Right now. 
 She wouldn't take her bandage off unless you were here. 
 If I can't fly, I don't know what I'll do. 
 And don't tell me I'll find something I'll care about just as much. 
 I wouldn't. 
 Okay. Just follow the light. 
 [ Pen light clicks ] 
 Let's do this. The suspense is killing me. 
 I want you to take your hand. Put it over your good eye. 
 Read the smallest letters you can see. 
 "T... P... Q... Z... A..." 
 "R." 
 20/20. 
 [ Chuckles ] 
 Sound good enough for you? 
 [ Crying ] Yes. 
 We need you in North 7. 
 Wheels up. 
 It's the C.F. BP is 78/37. 
 Temp is 102.1. 
 He was 100 an hour ago. 
 Gave him a gram of Tylenol... It hasn't come down. 
 Pablo, I'm gonna listen to your chest for a minute here, buddy. 
 He's septic. 
 Prep for a line. Get a pedi cath. 
 But y-you said he was okay. 
 He was, but he has a very serious infection from the cystic fibrosis. 
 We're gonna take care of him. Don't worry. 
 Okay, uh, let's get him to center stage. 
 Pablo, we're gonna take care of you, buddy. 
 [ Grunts ] 
 That feel better, Mr., uh, Spider? 
 Hell yeah, brother. You're a damn pro. 
 Got a gurney coming in. 
 Got it. 
 On it. 
 All right, let's go. 
 What's going on? 
 Body on the ramp. Someone jumped. 
 She didn't want sedation. 
 [ Panting ] 
 Oh, Nancy. 
 1, 2, 3, and down. 
 It's like her insides are liquid. 
 Jesse : Heart rate's thready and very tachy. 
 Sat 80. 
 Get ready to intubate. RSI meds, please. 
 I got this. I want to run it. 
 C-collar precautions, please. 
 30 of etomidate, 120 of sux. 
 Yes, doctor. 
 Neal : You tell me what you see. 
 Watch the torquing on the handle. 
 I got... cords! 
 Good. We'll need the ultrasound. 
 Excuse me, please. Coming through. 
 Chest and pelvic films. 
 Leanne : Coming in. 
 All right, watch the wires. Coming through. 
 Watch your backs. 
 Blood in the right upper quadrant and in the pelvis. 
 Probable pelvic fractures. 
 She's bradying down, Dr. Leighton. 
 [ Flatline ] 
 No pulse. 
 What are you aiming for? 
 Pablo. 
 The suprasternal notch. 
 Pablo? Why isn't he answering me? 
 Oh, God. I could have punctured his lung. 
 Flora, we're taking care of your son, but you need you to step away and give us space. 
 You said you fixed him. You said you... you... you... you fixed him. 
 Jesse, can you please explain to Ms. Saracho what's going on here? 
 Sorry. 
 [ Speaking Spanish ] 
 Leanne : Here. Take this. 
 Pulse check. 
 [ Flatline continues ] 
 Continue CPR. 
 Another round of epi? 
 [ Breathes sharply ] 
 Pulse check. 
 [ Flatline continues ] 
 I've got it from here. 
 No cardiac activity. 
 [ Monitor clicks, flatline stops ] 
 Time of death... 12:45 A.M. 
 This is all my fault. 
 It most certainly is not your fault. 
 You did everything you could, Angus. 
 Leanne : Christa, focus. 
 Careful. 
 [ Monitor beeping ] 
 We just lost diastolic pressure. 
 Christa? 
 Keep moving. 
 All right, more fluids through this line, please. 
 Let's change from zosyn to mero. 
 Okay, got it. 
 Pressure is back up. 
 Good job. 
 [ Jesse speaking Spanish ] 
 He's okay. 
 Thank you. 
 [ Sighs ] 
 It's not right. 
 What do you mean? 
 That little boy gonna need real care. 
 Well, I don't like it, either. 
 <i>Quien a buen árbol se arrima,</i> buena sombra le cobija. 
 When you... snuggle up to a good tree... 
 Wait... A good shade will shelter you. 
 It's something my <i>abuela </i> used to say. 
 It means, when you need help, find the best person you can. 
 Does he have any family here? 
 Yeah, he has a father who's apparently not interested. 
 As <i>abuela </i> Anita said, a good tree has many branches. 
 [ Siren wails in distance ] 
 The surgery went well. 
 The spinal surgeon said it's 50-50 I ever walk again. 
 A funny definition of "well." 
 It could have been a lot worse, I hear. 
 Much. 
 Susan... signed the consent? 
 Yeah, she did. 
 [ Sobbing ] 
 Here. Try to rest, okay? 
 [ Footsteps ] 
 I brought some clothing for you and your crossword. 
 Stop it. Look at me. 
 [ Sighs ] 
 What's gonna happen to us? 
 Is there still an "us"? 
 I haven't decided yet. 
 I did a stupid thing. 
 I deserve everything that's happened to me. 
 No one deserves this. 
 No one. 
 [ Sighs ] 
 [ Sighs ] 
 She's weaned off sedation. Are you sure she's ready? 
 She's breathing off the ventilator. 
 We should get an ABG. 
 No. Let's pull it off. 
 We're gonna get you off this breathing tube and on your own, Dorothy. 
 Soon as I pull the tube, give me a deep breath. 
 [ Monitor beeping slowly ] 
 She's apneic. 
 Wait. 
 Should we re-intubate? 
 Hold on. 
 At her age, she might not come off it. 
 I'll bag her through it. 
 1...2... 
 3...4... 
 She needs an airway, Dr. Pineda. 
 Wait. 
 [ Monitor beeping rhythmically ] 
 We're going back up. 
 88%. 
 90%. 
 She's gonna fly without the bag. 
 I don't think so. 
 Trust me. 
 [ Breathing slowly ] 
 Click your heels, Dorothy. 
 There's no place like home. 
 I'm gonna give you a prescription for oxycodone. 
 You're not the first guy this has happened to, and you won't be the last. 
 Let's not talk about it. 
 This should help with the pain. 
 You know, you used to look like you. 
 Not anymore. 
 I'm 45, divorced. 
 I'm a walking advertisement for the pill that put me here. 
 Not so sure you're a good ad for that anymore. 
 [ Chuckles ] 
 As far as I can tell, there's nothing physically wrong with you that's causing the E.D., which means it's all in your head. 
 I could have told you that. 
 The girl I was supposed to be with tonight? 
 She's incredible. 
 Mm. 
 Beautiful, smart, 20 years younger than me. 
 Truth is... 
 I was scared. 
 Everybody gets scared. 
 What? You think I don't get scared? 
 [ Chuckles ] 
 I wish they made a pill for what I got. 
 What's that? 
 Every day, I wait for someone to tap me on the shoulder and tell me this doctor thing was a mistake. 
 I'm actually a mechanic in New Jersey. 
 It's called "Imposter Syndrome." 
 It's the feeling you're about to be found out as a fraud. 
 Everybody has it. 
 We're all faking it. 
 Maybe that's your answer, too. 
 Everybody gets nervous, and we're all faking it. 
 Do me a favor. 
 If you ever run into me, we've never met, okay? 
 Never seen you before in my life. 
 [ Speaking Spanish ] 
 Doctor, um... 
 It's gonna be okay. 
 [ Crying ] I am scared. 
 I know. 
 Oh, my God. 
 Who is that? 
 That's my son's grandmother. 
 [ Crying ] Oh! 
 I told you she was a good lady. 
 [ Crying ] 
 Oh! 
 Yes... she is. 
 [ Bells jingle ] 
 [ Horn honks, siren wails in distance ] 
 Join me for breakfast? 
 After last night, I'm surprised you're not rushing home to bed, Dr. Hudson. 
 Neal... At Hector's, it's Neal. 
 Neal. 
 Ah, excuse me. Thank you. 
 Come on. Stay for breakfast. 
 A tradition after every shift... 
 Huevos rancheros and the paper of record. 
 Hey, médico guapo, you and Doctora Hermosa want to try my new Mexican bloody Mary? 
 New tradition for you. 
 Definitely. 
 Definitely.
