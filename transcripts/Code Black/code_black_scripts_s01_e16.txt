 Previously on "Code Black"...  
 [Screams] 
 Run, Malaya! Run! 
 No, no, no, no, no! Don't pull that knife! 
 Oh, my god. 
 I'm gonna kill that bitch. 
 [Gagging] 
 Help me. Help. 
 [Siren wailing] 
 [Radio chatter] 
 [Doors opening, closing] 
 [Gurney clatters] 
 22-year-old female. Pulmonary fibrosis. 
 Acute shortness of breath. S.A.T.s in the 70s. 
 Center stage. Prep an airway, Dr. Savetti. 
 Sir, what's her name, please? 
 Lizzie. I'm her husband. 
 Please, Lizzie, hold on! 
 [Gasping] Call... them. Call them. 
 No, no! You're gonna be okay. 
 Right? She's gonna be okay. 
 [Indistinct chatter] 
 Rollie : One, two, three. 
 Lizzie, I'm Dr. Guthrie. 
 Can you take in a deep breath for me? 
 [Gasping] 
 Completely absent on the left. 
 Neck veins distended. 
 Tension's pneumo. 
 All right. Quickly, let's do a finger thoracostomy. 
 Got it. 
 Chest tube second. 
 James... please. 
 We don't need them, Lizzie, okay? 
 You're gonna make it. 
 [Gasping] 
 [Coughing] She's got like 20 scars here. 
 These are chest-tube scars. Lung transplant? 
 Yeah, two. 
 Dear god, this poor child. 
 I'm okay. 
 No, she... she's strong. 
 [Gasping] 
 I got air. 
 Get the chest tube in there, Dr. Savetti. 
 James... please. 
 No, I'm not doing this, okay? You're gonna be fine! 
 Sir, you need to tell me what's going on. 
 I've planned a coordinated death if I die. 
 What does that mean? 
 She hired a cryogenics company to freeze her body if she dies. 
 So I'll be able to live again. 
 It's gonna be okay. 
 Angus : Hey. 
 Nobody told me you were coming in today. 
 I wasn't sure myself. 
 Well, I'm glad you did. 
 Mike : Dr. Pineda. 
 Can't tell you how good it is to see you here. 
 Let me know if you need anything, okay? 
 Angus, you're with me. 
 You okay? 
 Yep. 
 I mean about seeing Malaya. 
 Remember what I said, man. You got to keep it together. 
 Just leave it alone, Mike, all right? 
 I'm Dr. Mike Leighton. This is Dr. Angus Leighton. 
 You married or brothers? 
 Brothers. 
 You never know these days. 
 You've been having abdominal pain, vomiting? 
 We were on our way out when he just doubled over. 
 I'm fine. Let me just go home. 
 Dad, stop being so stubborn. 
 Okay, stomach feels distended. Dr. Leighton, bowel sounds? 
 B.P.'s a little low. Temp 102. 
 Of all days for this to happen. 
 What do you think? 
 Concerning for obstruction. 
 Where were you guys headed? 
 A Valentine's day charity luncheon. 
 Odell Beckham's being honored. 
 Dad was his coach in high school. 
 His people sent us tickets. 
 He  sent us tickets, Dad. 
 I'm a prop, that's all. 
 Dr. Leighton, what do you want to do? 
 Scan the belly for starters. 
 Good. And a full sepsis work-up. 
 Coach... Odell Beckham... 
 You must have done something right. 
 He came fully loaded. 
 I just counted the touchdowns. 
 We're gonna run some tests, see what we got. 
 Hey, careful of the tux. It's a rental. 
 Hey. 
 Hey, yourself. 
 There's a patient inside. 
 The woman that brought her in is asking for you. 
 Her name is Grace Adams? 
 Grace? She's here now? 
 Yeah. She's wearing an Angels jacket. 
 Think she might work here. 
 No, no, she used to. Used to work here. 
 Hm. 
 [Curtain opens] 
 Grace. 
 Neal. Hi. 
 This is Roseline. 
 Hello, Roseline. 
 How do you do? 
 [Chuckles] 
 I brought Roseline back with me from Port-au-Prince. 
 Grace spent the past year working with Operation Hope in Haiti. 
 Wow. Good for you. 
 Thanks. 
 Roseline has a tumor on her spinal cord that's making it increasingly difficult for her to walk. 
 I brought her back on a tourist visa in hopes that I could get her the surgery that she needs. 
 You'll need Campbell for that, and he, uh... 
 Well, he won't be easy to convince. 
 Let's start with a CT scan and take it from there. 
 I'll order it now. 
 Thank you. 
 So, who's Grace? 
 Told you, she's a doctor who used to work here. 
 I know that. I'm asking who she is to you. 
 [Door opens] 
 Shut up. 
 You've seen me in clothes before. 
 Not during a shift. 
 Oh, I don't know why I said yes to this. 
 I'm a doctor, not a whatever I am. 
 You're a doctor no matter what you're wearing. 
 If I'm gonna be here, I'd rather be in center stage. 
 What is that, a tamale? For breakfast? 
 As my abuela Anita used to say, "you wear the skin you're born in." 
 Yeah, but did she also mention that your heart has to live in there? 
 Forgive her, abuela, for she knows nada. 
 You don't have to believe. 
 You just have to be okay if I believe. 
 Lizzie, we've been through this 15 times before, and you've always come home. 
 It's not like the last 15 times. 
 James, this is different. 
 Is everything, uh, okay? 
 She wants me to get Randor here, the cryogenics company. 
 How's it work, anyway? 
 Freeze my brains and my vital organs. 
 Snake oil. 
 It's not snake oil. 
 I started a Kickstarter campaign to pay for it last year. 
 Doc, can you please just tell her that this is crazy? 
 I don't know anything about it, so... 
 You know my chances of surviving this, right? 
 Tell him that. 
 We don't give percentages here. 
 Well, then let me put it another way. 
 Is there a chance that she could live? 
 Of course. 
 But you need to believe that you can. 
 I do. 
 But... 
 I have a parachute in case I'm wrong. 
 Yeah. 
 Neal : She's only in the country this week. 
 She goes back to Haiti, where she's living in a refugee camp. 
 This is not an emergent case. 
 Why are we talking about this? 
 That's why we are talking about it, otherwise I would have just called someone to come down and pick her up. 
 We are asking for a favor. 
 It's a pretty big favor, Leanne. 
 The surgery alone will cost well into the six figures. 
 Who is she? 
 She's a little girl who needs our help. 
 I can throw a tennis ball off the roof of this hospital and hit about 30 little girls that need our help. 
 She's deteriorating, and we can help her. 
 You mean  I  can help her. 
 You want me to perform major surgery on a 13-year-old girl, and yet I don't see a pediatric referral, no pre-op work-up, no chest X-rays, EKGs, blood work. 
 Should I keep going? 
 All those tests and referrals take days. 
 She doesn't have that kind of time. 
 Her visa will run out. 
 Not my problem. 
 Frankly, I'm surprised at  you,  Leanne. 
 I'm sure you are. 
 He's an arrogant ass. 
 But he's not entirely wrong. 
 If she'd been hit by a bus and had come in by ambulance, she'd be in that O.R. right now, no questions asked. 
 Yeah, well, I guess she wasn't lucky enough to be hit by a bus. 
 Christa : You did the right thing coming here. 
 But it's normal for a new mom to feel rundown, especially after a c-section. 
 Still, this... this feels different than I expected. 
 I'm a marathon runner. 
 I was doing three miles a day a couple weeks before I gave birth to this little guy. 
 Your EKG was normal. 
 I'm short of breath, and something just feels wrong. 
 I... I can't explain it. It's... it's more than just rundown. 
 We should get an X-ray, run some tests, make sure there's no infections or any other complications. 
 Is it okay if I bring him? 
 Well, you're gonna be in the X-ray machine for a while. 
 You have any family in the waiting area? 
 No. 
 No, I'm a... I'm a single mom. 
 I di... I didn't have anyone to ask. 
 We can hold him for you. 
 We can? 
 We'll take turns. 
 [Coos] 
 Okay. 
 [Gasping, coughs] 
 Check the chest tube. Did she pop her lung again? 
 No, there's condensation on them. They're still working. 
 What's happening to her? 
 Sounds like fluid. 
 Okay. Lizzie, listen to me. 
 We need to take action or you will die in minutes. 
 No. Let me be. 
 Don't do anything. 
 No! What?! Li... Li... 
 She'll make it through this. She always does. 
 James, let me go. 
 What? No! Lizzie, don't... 
 Don't give up, okay? Don't give up. 
 Look, they're gonna fix you. 
 It's time. 
 No! It's not time, all right? They're gonna fix you. 
 They're gonna... they're gonna make you better, okay? 
 James, I'm not so sure if... 
 Lizzie! Don't give up, honey, all right? 
 Please, please don't give up, all right? 
 You're gonna make it. You're gonna make it. 
 They're gonna make you better. 
 They're gonna fix you, all right? Please? 
 All right. Let's go. 
 [Gasping] 
 [Monitor beeping] 
 Angus : What happened? 
 He was in a lot of pain, then I think he fainted. 
 His abdomen is rock-hard. I need more N.S. and levophed. 
 He's septic. 
 Did you get the sepsis work-up? 
 Not yet. 
 "Not yet"? Damn it, Angus. 
 How's his IVC? 
 Collapsed. The tank is low. 
 What's he on? 
 Vanc, Zosyn, and four liters of N.S. so far. 
 [Rapid beeping] 
 Systolic is 50. M.A.P. of 40. 
 He's gonna arrest. 
 Let's get him to center stage. 
 Come here. 
 We can't give up on Roseline. 
 You heard Campbell. 
 Even Leanne doesn't think it's possible. 
 What do you want me to do? 
 Look behind God's curtain. 
 Sorry? 
 That's what you used to say about surgery. 
 That it was like seeing behind god's curtain. 
 I was flirting. 
 No, you weren't. 
 [Chuckles] 
 Come on. We've never let anything stop us before. 
 Grace, there's no us. 
 You're still mad. 
 What did you expect? 
 That you'd drop in here and we'd just pick up where we left off? 
 I never meant to hurt you, Neal. 
 You found someone else. 
 After you and I were over. 
 Fine. Whatever you think of me... 
 Please don't take it out on this sweet little girl. 
 You know me better than that. 
 In a lot of ways, I think I know you better than anyone. 
 No. 
 No, you don't. 
 Okay, Angus, focus. He needs a high line. You got it? 
 Angus, your attending asked you a question. 
 Yes. Yes. I've got the Levophed up. 
 Watch from here, okay? 
 I'll start another line on the right. 
 Jesse : Guys, she's satting in the 70s. 
 Can't wait anymore. We need to intubate. 
 What does that mean? 
 We have to put her in a coma so we can put a breathing tube in. 
 Sux and etomidate, Dr. Guthrie? 
 Yes. Have them ready, please. 
 Wait! Um... her... her transplant surgeon said that if she goes on a breathing machine, she might never come off of it. 
 I'm sorry, but there's no other way. 
 There may be another way. 
 Lizzie, can you squeeze my hand? 
 She is still responding to commands. 
 We could try BiPAP. 
 James : Wha... what's that? 
 It's a machine that helps her breathe through a mask, not a tube. 
 But she has to be able to work with the machine. 
 If she can, it could help clear the fluid in her lungs and save her. 
 Yes. Uh, right, honey? 
 Yes, we... we want this. 
 Let's do it now, Dr. Savetti. 
 I got maybe 40 over palp. 
 Mike : He's in cardiopulmonary collapse. 
 We got to attack this. More fluids. 
 His mean arterial pressure was always above 65. 
 I didn't think he'd reach sepsis so fast. 
 Did you check other measures of profusion? 
 Of course. 
 Urine output? 
 Low. 
 Lactate? 
 High. 
 Look, I could not have predicted that this would happen so fast. 
 Come on. Angus, you in on your line? 
 Man : Make sure the ICU is notified. 
 Angus?! 
 Angus, you have a patient in distress. Get those fluids in now. 
 We got this, Dr. Rorish. 
 Doesn't look like it to me. 
 Titrating levo now. 
 Risa : Okay. B.P. rising. 
 90 over 60. 
 Angus, I don't know where your head is, but in this room, you've got one focus, and that's your patient. Clear? 
 Dr. Rorish, can we talk, please? 
 Angus, take a break. 
 I'm the resident director now, and he's a resident. 
 So by definition, I direct the residents. 
 And I'm the director of the E.R., which means I direct you. 
 But by inserting yourself like that, you undermine my authority. 
 Do you have authority over your brother? 
 That's  my  problem. 
 Let me ask you, honestly, would you have ever tolerated anything like that from Taylor or Perello when you had this job? 
 Look, I think we're both just trying to figure out how to put on these new uniforms and make them fit. 
 Mario : You're doing great, Lizzie. 
 When you breathe in, the machine feels it and pushes air to help your lungs. 
 Woman : Someone from Randor Cryogenics called. 
 They're pulling into the ambulance bay. 
 You called them? 
 So, y... you just agreed to all this until they could get here? 
 Y... you're... you're giving up. 
 I'm not giving up. 
 Lizzie, I need you to believe that you can live. 
 I need you to believe that this will work. 
 I am gonna live. 
 Just not now. 
 [Breathes deeply] 
 50 years ago, no one could have imagined smartphones, the Internet... or salted chocolate. 
 [Chuckles, sniffles] 
 And 50 years from now, you'll wake me up, and we'll be together again. 
 In 50 years, I'll be 75. 
 [Laughs, coughs] 
 75 will be the new 20. 
 [Chuckles] 
 I'm gonna have to show you how everything works. 
 [Sniffles] 
 They'll have a program that'll download everything I need to know right into my brain. 
 Well, you always wanted to learn how to play saxophone. 
 [Coughs] 
 Next time I see you, I'll play it for you. 
 [Chuckles] 
 And then we can... we can go have dinner on the Moon. 
 [Chuckles] 
 You hate the cold. 
 I'll, um... 
 I'll check back in on her in a little bit. 
 Hey. I thought you were off today. 
 You're from Randor. The cryo people? 
 So, does your boyfriend Campbell know you work for a cryogenics company? 
 Yes, and now the two of you have something in common... 
 He doesn't approve, either. 
 But it's allowed? 
 I can whatever the hell I want on my days off. It's a job. 
 Dude... 
 Don't "dude" me. 
 I have over $250,000 in student-loan debts. 
 Randor pays me 30k. 
 To operate on dead bodies. 
 To prepare them for freezing. 
 You do know this is crazy, right? 
 Insane. But who cares? 
 Clients are happy, nobody gets hurt, and I get paid. 
 [Pager beeps] 
 My people are here. 
 Your people? 
 Well, two nurses. 
 I got to go fill out paperwork to release the body when she dies. 
 [Sighs] 
 You'll get over it. 
 I knew it was gonna be a challenge having him on my own, but I... you know, I thought I'd have a little time to ramp into it. 
 When he smiles back at you, you'll know it's all worth it. 
 Uh, did my test results come back? 
 Yes. They're good. Malaya has the results. 
 Malaya? 
 Of course. Sorry. 
 We saw a post-op atelectasis... 
 A post-op what? 
 It sounds much worse than it is. 
 It's a partial collapsing of your lung. 
 An area of your left lung wasn't inflating properly, which explains your oxygen levels. 
 We don't think you have anything to worry about. 
 You're sure? 
 You should take it easy for a couple days, but you're fine. 
 I'll start the discharge paperwork. 
 I'm not even gonna ask you how you got this MRI. 
 Look at the tumor. 
 It could kill Roseline, Leanne. 
 Yeah, I'm sympathetic, but the fact is it's not killing her right now. 
 You're hiding behind semantics. 
 Grace. 
 No. 
 The Leanne I remember wouldn't hesitate to take this on. 
 You're not helping, Grace. 
 Even if I supported you, Campbell refused. 
 You'd need a surgeon to sign on, and it'd have to be someone who is willing to go up against Campbell. 
 You two been talking? 
 No. That's the universe talking. 
 Neal, has it ever occurred to you that maybe you've run so far from your father that you've run right past yourself? 
 When was the last time you had your prostate checked, Mr. Delaney? 
 Dad? 
 A year ago. 
 They told me I had prostate cancer. 
 What? 
 Y... y... you've known for a y... y... a year? 
 I heard prostate cancer was a slow grower. 
 I was just trying to figure out what to do. 
 Um... unfortunately, your cancer wasn't so slow. 
 The tumor ended up perforating the colon. 
 We need to do surgery now... a total colectomy. 
 What the hell is that? 
 We have to remove your entire large intestine. 
 Oh, my god. 
 And what's left for me when you're done? 
 Your life. 
 It won't be without complications. 
 I would imagine that. 
 W... what complications? 
 Urinary-tract issues, impotence... 
 Can we not talk about this now? 
 No, I am done with secrets. 
 [Sighs] 
 So, he... he's gonna need a... a colostomy bag? 
 Yeah. 
 
 
 
 You want me to crap in a bag? 
 Hell no. 
 They told me I cou... I could get, uh, chemo. 
 And... and radiation, they said. 
 It's too late for that. 
 What would we do? What's next? 
 Nothing's next. I'm not doing it. 
 No! This is not up to you. 
 I'm not dead yet. 
 And until I am, it is up to me. 
 The answer... is no. 
 [Sniffles] 
 Seems like you got a lot left to live for, Mr. Delaney. 
 [Sighs] 
 Why would I disrupt trauma-one by taking away one of its best doctors while simultaneously pissing off the director of the O.R.? 
 Because it's the best of both worlds. May I? 
 How so? 
 The position is for a surgical attending who covers the emergency department. 
 That's what Cole Guthrie did. 
 Who better to cover trauma-one than someone who's spent his whole career working there? 
 Katie Miller says she still doesn't feel good. 
 I don't have any reason to hold her, but I don't feel right sending her home. 
 I mean, all alone with a new baby... 
 Thank you for talking to me about work and not asking me how I'm doing. 
 Be patient. 
 Trust me, you'll be surprised at how much you can endure, and how strong you actually are. 
 I'm sure you're right. 
 Wait a second. Katie's heart rate was normal, right? 
 90. A little high, but in the margin. 
 No, no, no, no, no. Not if she's a marathon runner. 
 Normal is probably in the 40s for her. 
 P.E.? 
 Oh, god. 
 I got vitals. 
 I'll wire her up. 
 What's going on? 
 We just have to check something. Have a seat. 
 Sats have dropped. 
 I'm getting worse? 
 [Breathlessly] I thought you said I was gonna be okay. 
 That's what we thought, but your oxygen levels are low. 
 We're gonna put you on something called an NRB mask. 
 It delivers high-concentration oxygen to your lungs. 
 Your symptoms could suggest a pulmonary embolism... 
 A clot in your lungs. 
 That would explain the elevated heart rate. 
 But I'm gonna be all right? 
 We need to get a CT scan right away to confirm whether it is a clot. 
 Ready? 
 ♪ 
 What are you doing, Dr. Hudson? 
 Dr. Harbert approved my transfer to the surgical department. 
 He told me. Congratulations. 
 However, the question remains. What are you doing? 
 I'm... scheduling my patient's surgery. 
 This is still my department. 
 That means I assign your resident, your surgical nurses, your anesthesiologist, and your O.R. 
 Welcome to my team, Dr. Hudson. 
 Hand me my phone, please. I want to check the scores. 
 Mom always said you were more stubborn than a constipated mule. 
 Yeah, well, Mom isn't around anymore, is she? 
 [Commotion in distance] 
 Ohh, you didn't. 
 Man : Odell Beckham! 
 Woman : That's Odell. 
 [Laughs] 
 Hey, Mia. 
 Long time no see. 
 Odell! 
 How you doing, Coach? 
 Odell, please talk some sense into him. 
 You always were a smartass kid, you know that? 
 Where'd you get that jacket, man? 
 Michael Jackson's closet. 
 [Chuckles] Yeah, yeah! 
 Grace : So, he still won't let you operate? 
 Neal : I'm sorry, Grace. 
 No, I'm sorry you made a major life decision for this only to have... 
 That's not why I made it. 
 It's just what precipitated it. 
 Excuse me, Dr. Adams, is the girl in the family room with you? 
 Yes, why? 
 You better come quick. 
 Christa : I went to bring her a book, and I found her seizing on the floor. 
 Neal : Let's get her on oxygen, please. 
 Okay, open your mouth. 
 Let's move her. Let's move her. 
 Neal : Grace, what's her baseline blood pressure? 
 She runs low. 90s over 70s. 
 That's the tumor keeping it low. 
 B.P. now 170 over 80. 
 That's better, right? 
 No, it's worse. 
 No, it's worse. 
 Leanne : She's in autonomic dysreflexia. 
 Her pressure can swing wildly from high to low as a result of the tumor. 
 And relative to her baseline, it's way too high. 
 Let's sit her up and get her legs underneath her, try and get her pressure down. 
 If we don't lower it, she could stroke out. 
 Christa, nicardipine. Five milligrams an hour. 
 Got it. I'll get the piggyback pump. 
 Oh! Okay. Ohh, oh, oh, oh. 
 We can't wait for the nicardipine drip. 
 10 of labetalol, please. Push, not drip! 
 Roseline... 
 Pushing 10 of labetalol now. 
 [Speaks French] 
 [Sighs] Vitals stable. 
 Thank god. 
 Neal, it's time. 
 You ready for this? 
 Campbell isn't gonna budge, Leanne. 
 Whether it's tumor or edema, she's getting worse. 
 It's emergent now. She could die. 
 Protocol is on our side now. 
 Let's get her upstairs. 
 Hey, hey. 
 Hey, Doc. You know who this guy is? 
 Who doesn't? Mr. Beckham, it's a real pleasure. 
 Thank you for helping me win my fantasy league two years in a row. Where's my check? 
 You should've seen this guy when he first walked on the field. 
 He was catching balls with one hand the first day of practice. 
 I told anybody that'd listen that he was one of the greats. 
 Let's me and you talk, Coach. 
 Thank you for doing this. 
 I'm glad I can. 
 Grace... 
 Why Roseline? 
 What do you mean? 
 There must have been hundreds of girls in that camp. 
 Why this one? 
 A long time ago, there was another little girl. 
 She was smart. 
 In fact, they put her in classes with kids a lot older than her. 
 The kids laughed at her because she came to school with her own stepladder. 
 A stepladder? 
 She was too little for the blackboard. 
 She wanted to make sure that if she was called upon, she could reach it. 
 That was you. 
 It's also her. 
 I wanted to learn. 
 Nothing was gonna stop me. 
 I'm not gonna let anything stop her, either. 
 Lizzie? Lizzie! 
 What happened? 
 She lost pulses while on BiPAP. 
 Lizzie, honey, it's okay. I'm... I'm right here. 
 It's been four minutes. 
 Okay, let's do a pulse check. 
 [Flatline] 
 Come back to me, Lizzie. Please, just fight. 
 Call it. What? 
 What? W... w... what's going on? 
 W... what are you... 
 Heather : Mario. 
 I can't do anything until you call it. 
 Time of death... 4:15. 
 No! [Sobbing] 
 Lizzie! Oh. 
 Oh. 
 They're with me. 
 ♪ 
 I believe, Lizzie. I believe, okay? 
 I love you. 
 And I'm gonna see you again, because I believe. 
 Pulmonary embolism. Good catch. 
 What do you want to do? 
 You could give her alteplase, bust up the clot. 
 But that risks a hemorrhage of the c-section. 
 Dr. Rorish, you have a sec? 
 38-year-old female, pulmonary embolism in the right lung. 
 Vitals stable. 
 Elevated resting heart rate, and she's a new mom by a c-section. 
 You debating alteplase? 
 How many days post-op? 
 Four. 
 She could bleed out. 
 But if you wait, the saddle embolism could kill her. 
 So, what should we do? 
 I'd take the risk and do the alteplase now. 
 But talk to the patient. 
 Let her make an informed decision. 
 Malaya : That's our recommendation, but the decision has to be yours. 
 [Sighs] 
 When I was... going through IVF, my mother asked me what would happen to him if something ever happened to me. 
 I thought she was just being unsupportive. 
 She thought what I was doing was selfish. 
 And maybe it was. 
 But I wanted a second chapter. 
 We're all entitled to that. 
 And then this little guy came along. 
 Turns out the chapter was being written by him, not me. 
 I want to live. 
 I still tell people about that Eastern game. 
 Last quarter, down five, clock running out. 
 He hasn't changed my mind. 
 Not what I was hoping to hear. 
 We need to get you to surgery now. 
 They had you, uh, double-covered with the safety over the top. 
 Somehow, you... you outran the coverage... 
 Odell : Coach... 
 ... and took it to the house. 
 Coach! 
 I'd never seen anybody get so much air. 
 [Chuckles] Coach. 
 And they held you... 
 Coach. 
 What?! 
 You're just gonna keep talking, huh? 
 The more I talk, the less I have to listen to you trying to convince me to go under the knife. 
 You need the surgery. 
 Why? 
 Because if you don't, you'll die. 
 Maybe I'm okay with that. 
 That's selfish. 
 You never taught me about giving up, and now you're giving up on us? 
 Beth left me. 
 Mrs. Coach. Remember? 
 I mean, can you believe that after all these years? 
 She just decided she had enough of me. 
 We were supposed to spend our last, best years together, now I got nothing. 
 You have Mia. 
 [Scoffs] I don't want to be a burden on her. 
 [Sighs] 
 Coach, you taught me never take your losses into the next game. 
 Ever. 
 Good advice. 
 And what if it doesn't work? 
 What... what if I put her through all this and I'm still dead? 
 Then I'll give a beautiful speech at the funeral. 
 I'll let them all know that I would never be here without you. 
 You teached me how to have courage, play with grit, stay persistent. 
 We need to get this done. 
 [Helicopter blades whirring] 
 I mean, literally, I have this... 
 This weird sensation where I look at my hands, but... 
 They're not my hands. 
 [Screams] 
 You know what I mean? 
 One thing's for certain. 
 It is definitely going to get better. 
 You sure about that? 
 Absolutely. 
 [Pager beeps, vibrates] 
 Well, that didn't take long. 
 Welcome back. 
 Malaya. It's good to see you back again. 
 You're worried about her. 
 In my experience, we heal better from the things that are done to us than the things that we do to others. 
 What does that mean? 
 My mother used to call it "getting right with God." 
 Now, you don't have to tell me anything that you don't want to, but that doesn't mean that I can't make a suggestion. 
 That man, the one who hurt our people, is still here. 
 His body is in the morgue, unclaimed. 
 Every other Saturday, the hospital buries all the unclaimed bodies in white oak cemetery. 
 [Chuckling] After what he did, you... you want me to go pay my respects to him? 
 I didn't suggest that you go for[i] him, ♪ I got O.B. and blood bank standing by. Joshua's in the nursery having his bottle. Okay. We ready to do this? You know who to call if this all goes wrong. Nothing's gonna go wrong. But, yes. I promise I will look after him until your mother arrives. God. I didn't go through three rounds of IVF to have my crazy mother raise him. This has to work. Okay. Jesse, hand the syringe to Malaya. You got this? Malaya : Yeah. You should begin to feel better immediately if it works the way we think it will, okay? How are you feeling, Katie? No different yet. All right, breathe normally for me. Oxygen climbing. Oh. Oh, I can feel it. Oh, my god. Christa : Easy, calm breaths. Oh, I can breathe! Yeah. Easy. It worked! Deep breaths. Calm. [Monitor beeping] Oh. What... what? What... what's happening? Whoa, whoa, whoa. B.P.'s crashing, guys. Jesse, get me a surgical tray. Alert O.B. Call in a verbal for blood and platelets. We've got to re-open the c-section until O.B. gets here. Most of the bulk of the tumor is resected now. Almost done? Unfortunately, that's, uh, a rather big "almost." You see this structure here? That's the anterior spinal artery. And you see this gray, shiny stuff? Those are the bad cells that are literally eating into the artery. There is one piece. [Sighs] 100 more to go. That's a defeating thought. Oh, no. Neal. It's okay. This can happen. Pass me the hemostat, and get me a 5-0. Come on. Come on. [Grunts] Damn. More suction. Damn. Give me a 4-0. Okay. Suction, please, Nurse. Get this in. Is everything okay? What's wrong? No. Damn it. Get me a Kelly. More suction. No. Another 4-0, please. Damn it, damn it, damn it. Her blood pressure is plummeting. Hang another two units, wide open. Grace, I need help. What do you need me to do? Get Campbell. What? Campbell? Yeah, he's done thousands of these. Please, just get him. Get him now. Forceps and hemostat now. Suction. I clamped the anterior spinal artery... I can see what you did. Nurse, suture, please. Suction. One more suture, please. You can come down off the blood now. The bleeding has stopped. Let me help with that flap. Dr. Hudson, that's enough. It's my case now. You can go. You don't want the help of another surgeon? Is there one around? It's okay. O.B.'s on the way. Blood bank's sending down a six-pack. Tocin is up. She's gonna need more sutures. Oh, god. She has a son upstairs. We told her to do this. ♪ [Echoing] Malaya, calm down. Take a deep breath. I can't do this. Dr. Pineda! Get back here right now. This is your patient. Dr. Pineda, look at me and listen to my voice. Your patient's bleeding is similar to a postpartum hemorrhage. Okay? There's no one bleed source. It's the whole uterus leaking blood. So what do we do? Should I get a... No. Stay right there. What do we do for postpartum hemorrhaging? Um, uh, we... we try to induce contractions. Yes. Good. Now get over here. I need your hands. Okay, Dr. Lorenson, clamp that vessel, please. Jesse, resect the skin. You see that? Right there. That's the uterus. Now, both of you get your hands in there. Now, what happens when we massage the uterus directly? It contracts. Stopping the bleeding. Good. Yes. Keep massaging. Apply pressure, be firm. Here, Jesse. Thank you, Dr. Rorish. A Foley? Yep. All right, Dr. Lorenson, insert that catheter into the uterus. We're gonna keep kneading the uterus while you inflate it. Malaya, you've got a nurse waiting for your order. Jesse, blood and fluids wide open, please. Yes, Doctor. Is it working? B.P.'s 90 over 80. Bleeding is slowing down. [Sighs] It's working. You bet it is. All right. Let's pack these wounds, get her to an O.R. Okay, guys. Come on. Let's go. Pack it up. [Sighs] Jesse : Yeah, so, you know, on my block, I was, like, the leftie, you know? I always used to get picked first, so... that was my thing. Mm-hmm. Hey, uh... oh, oh. Odell, this is little Joshua. Hold him for a second. Be right back. Don't drop him, buddy. Okay. Whoa, whoa, whoa! Easy. Okay. Leanne! Leanne, Leanne, Leanne. Odell Beckham. Greatest catch in NFL history. Hey. You changed back into your scrubs. What's up? You got to wear the skin you're born in, mama. Leanne. You set me up. How so? You forgot to mention, when you asked me to meet with Neal, that the real reason he wanted the job was so he could perform an unapproved surgery on an undocumented alien minor. That wasn't the only reason, and the surgery was approved. Nonetheless, I'd like to know the motives of the people I hire. Then you ought to try to get to know us better. If you knew me at all, you would know I have to do this job my way. Is that what the, uh... The scrubs are all about? Leanne : It's a start. Have a good day, Doctor. Mike : How you feeling? So good I want to crap my pants. But I guess those days are over. At least you have a sense of humor. I don't. Odell does. He's out in the waiting room signing his 400th autograph right now. Hey, you said earlier that he invited you to his charity event as a prop. [Chuckles] Yeah. You want to know why he really invited you, Mr. Delaney? His speech is on the Internet, and here's what he said... "A great man once told me that temperament is displayed in failure, but character is revealed in success. Pete Delaney taught me that." Pete Delaney taught me how to win. He also taught me how to be a winner. You remember that? I remember everything you taught me, Coach. Every single thing. [Chuckles] You got your camera? Come on. One for posterity. Here we go. [Camera shutter clicks] [Joshua cooing] Malaya : You fought like a... A warrior? Like a mom. Aww. Hi. [Chuckles] [Sighs] Hey, you. Hi. How did I do? It worked, Roseline. [Chuckles] [Sniffles] There's gonna be some recovery time. I'll have a place for us to stay by the time you're ready to leave here. A place for  us? I'm gonna get your visa extended while you're in recovery. It's gonna be a few weeks before you can really walk. Till then, I thought I might apply for something... a little more permanent. How? They said I could have my job back here at the E.R. if I wanted. I thought maybe, um, if I could make it so that you could stay here with me... Would you want that? Remember when we read "Arabian Nights," and you asked me, if I found a genie in a lamp who could grant me three wishes, what would they be? Yeah, I remember. I told you I only had two. Yeah, and you wouldn't tell me what they were. What does the unluckiest girl in the world do when she wakes from a long sleep to find that she's been granted both her wishes in the same day? [Voice breaking] I don't know. She thanks Grace. [Sighs] [Sniffles] Hey. What are you doing here? Oh, I just got that patient into a deep-freeze pod at Randor. And now I have a shift. Long day. Man, those people are nuts. They really believe all that crap. I know. We all have stuff we believe. Heaven, the afterlife, reincarnation. Everything someone believes in is gonna sound crazy to someone else. That's pretty deep, Savetti. Have a good shift. ♪ Um, is this the Angels memorial service? It is. Are you here to pay your respects? Uh, honestly, I, uh... I don't know why I'm here. Rollie : Young squire. Glad to see you could make it. What are you doing here? I come to all of these. You're not the only one who needs to get right with god. Hail Mary, full of grace. The Lord is with thee. Blessed art thou among women, and blessed is the fruit of thy womb, Jesus. Holy Mary, mother of God, pray for us sinners, now...
