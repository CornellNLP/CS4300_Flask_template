 [ Siren wails ] 
 Jesse : Unfortunately, the prayers of the good people of Los Angeles have been answered and it's raining, and nothing brings people to Angels faster than the rain. 
 Good luck. 
 Well, you're not coming up with us? 
 No. It's raining. 
 [ Both chuckle ] 
 [ Sighs ] 
 What... what are you doing? 
 Dips. You should try it sometime. 
 I've been texting Christa all these panic-faced emojis, and she's not responding. 
 Took a cab to work this morning, and I'm on time. 
 What happened to your car? 
 Oh, clutch busted. 
 It's gonna cost me a grand to fix it. 
 Why didn't you tell me? I could have just picked you up. 
 I drive right by you on the way to work. 
 How do you know I slept at my place? 
 Okay, player. I was just trying to help. 
 [ Chuckling ] God! 
 Christa : Hey. 
 What are you guys doing out here? 
 Medevac's coming in. I've been texting you. 
 Is everything all right? 
 Yeah. Yeah, it's raining. 
 Traffic is horrible. Why? Did anyone say anything? 
 [ Elevator bell dings ] You're late, Dr. Lorenson. Let's go. 
 [ Sighs ] You three with me. 
 Damn it. 
 Come on. Let's go! 
 [ Button clicking ] 
 [ Doors close ] 
 Dr. Lorenson, over here. 
 [ Button clicking ] [ Sighs ] 
 Did you get any sleep this afternoon? 
 No, did you? 
 I feel responsible. 
 For what? We had a few drinks at breakfast. 
 Okay, maybe more than a few drinks. 
 You have the code bag tonight, Christa. 
 Oh, wow. 
 O-okay. 
 You're responsible for all the crashes that happen at the hospital outside the E.R. 
 Anyone loses their pulse upstairs, they're calling you. 
 I know what the code bag is. 
 [ Sighs ] 
 It's completely random who gets it. 
 That's the whole point... To catch you off guard. 
 Well, consider me caught. 
 You'll have everything you need in the bag... 
 Uh, oral airways, drugs, extra syringes, filler needles, the phone. 
 It's connected to the wireless network in case you lose reception. 
 Who do I call in the middle of a code? 
 It's there if you need radiology, respiratory techs, the pharmacy. 
 You'll still be working your shift, of course. 
 [ Sighs ] When it rains, it pours, huh? 
 [ Elevator dings ] 
 You can handle this, right? 
 Yeah, doctor, I can handle it. 
 [ Helicopter blades whirring ] 
 Let's go! 
 Move it! 
 Risa : What have you got? 
 Boating accident. They capsized. 
 May have been submerged over two hours. 
 The boy... Pulseless on the scene. 
 Excuse me, Dr. Pineda. 
 How long without a pulse? 
 Since we got there. 
 At least 20 minutes of CPR. 
 All right. What about this one? 
 Man : Young woman, possible leg fracture. 
 In and out of consciousness. Vitals are stable. 
 Stable! All right, I want the boy first. 
 What's his temperature? 
 What? 
 His core temp! How cold is he? 
 We tried. It said "error". 
 Error? 
 Yeah, his core temperature is too cold to register on the machine. 
 Too low? 
 Good. Clear! 
 [ Woman groaning ] 
 Neal : Okay, Sophie. All right. 
 [ Device beeps ] Temperature... 90.1. 
 We have to get her warmed immediately. 
 Get me a bear hugger. 
 [ Groaning continues ] 
 All right, all right, all right. 
 Let's get her restrained, please! 
 Get her restrained, please. 
 Why is she trying to get undressed? 
 It's called paradoxical undressing. 
 It's a sign of stage III hypothermia and evidence of brain dysfunction. 
 All right. Let's help her out of her clothes, please. 
 I think she has a broken femur. 
 Aah. Maybe from the boat capsizing. 
 Let me have a temporary splint! Can't wait for casting. 
 This girl needs warmth more than anything. 
 [ Groaning continues ] 
 Let's go, please. Come on. 
 Okay, 20-something male, asystolic in the field, drowning and hypothermia. 
 Temp feels like 80s. 
 Mama, we're gonna need a core temp and warm saline. 
 Jesse : Got it. Warm saline, guys. Come on! 
 Come on, we need some blankets in here. 
 His temp is in the 80s, Dr. Savetti. 
 He needs active warming, not a blanket. 
 Here. 
 We need to flood his heart and lungs with everything we've got. 
 Core temp... 82. No heart rate. 
 How long were compressions going on in the field? 
 At least 30 minutes. 
 We were waiting to call time of death till we got here. 
 9...10... 
 Mario : Scalpel. 
 Dr. Rorish, we've already done eight rounds of ACLS, another 10 minutes of CPR. 
 You can each do six minute CPR shifts. 
 That's 10 an hour. 
 An hour of CPR? Two, if necessary. 
 Don't stop until that number is in the mid-90s. 
 [ Monitor beeping rapidly] 
 You are the heart now. 
 All we know for sure right now is that he's frozen. 
 Bottom line, he's not dead until he's warm and dead. 
 [ Monitor beeping ] 
 [ Respirator hissing ] 
 [ Sighs ] Your turn. 
 [ Alarm beeping ] [ Panting ] 
 This must be what's it like to go to the gym. 
 Wow. Look at this. 
 What is that? 
 Oh, I think it's an engagement ring. 
 Look at that. 
 Oh, my God. 
 He was gonna ask her to marry him? 
 Oh, you don't know that. 
 Of course I do. 
 Should we tell her? 
 No. 
 I mean, I don't think he's gonna... 
 Oh, my God. We have to tell her. 
 What if he was having second thoughts, huh? 
 You know, he was floating in the water, might have been his last moments on Earth. 
 He didn't ask her then, right? 
 Well, he was too busy drowning. 
 I... you are the least romantic person I have ever met in my life! 
 You can't propose to a girl for someone else, okay? 
 Listen. 
 [ Monitors beeping ] 
 His temp is in the mid-90s. 
 His pulses are strong. 
 Good pupillary response. 
 [ Laughs ] Yeah! 
 Dr. Rorish, we have a got a live one. 
 You can stop celebrating, please. 
 Blood pressure's 60 over 40. 
 There you go. You're ignoring the first rule. 
 Make no assumptions. 
 There's more... There's always more. 
 Let's get a fast ultrasound, please. 
 He could have underlying trauma from the boat capsizing. 
 Uh, who saw this... 
 A bruise on the upper quadrant? 
 No one? 
 Great. You skipped the exam. 
 That's Monitor Syndrome. 
 We don't rely on machines in here. 
 We use our eyes and our hands. 
 This here is indicative of bleeding. 
 What do you see? 
 Chest clear, right abdomen clear, left abdomen... blood. 
 All right. Let's increase fluids. 
 One liter wide open, 2 units of blood. 
 This could be a splenic laceration. 
 Why is that something we didn't want to miss, Dr. Leighton? 
 It can cause life-threatening bleeding and particularly, can worsen over time. 
 Exactly. 
 So let's get a scan. Someone page a surgeon. 
 Mark my words... He's gonna need an O.R. 
 I need to ask you what year it is. 
 When can I see Killian? 
 I honestly don't know. 
 Can you tell me where you are? 
 He wanted to do something special. 
 He sailed his whole life. 
 He wasn't worried about the weather. 
 [ Voice breaking ] He's dead, isn't he? 
 Neal : Hello, Sophie. I'm Dr. Hudson. 
 I don't imagine you remember me. 
 No. 
 Well, I remember you. 
 Clocked me pretty good in the face. 
 Malaya : Her neuro exam was normal. 
 Good. You look a lot better. 
 Sophie, you've got a displaced fracture of your femur. 
 It's very important that you cooperate with us and don't... 
 He saved my life. 
 He got banged around when the boat capsized, but still he made sure I was on top of the hull out of the water. 
 He couldn't climb up to me, so I held his hand as he floated right under me. 
 He stopped talking, and I thought he was... 
 Is he dead? 
 No. He's still fighting, okay? 
 ♪ 
 [ Sighs ] 
 Hi. How many people so far? 
 64. 
 Really? That's great. 
 Make that 65. 
 Thank for you doing this, Angus. 
 Nothing says "I love you" like a bone marrow drive. 
 How's Carla doing? 
 Carla's not the best patient. 
 Well, she's a doctor. We're all terrible patients. 
 You told her you were doing this, right? 
 It wouldn't be happening, then. 
 Malaya, I know you're trying to help her, but maybe it's not the best idea to just push this on her. 
 But she's refusing treatment. What am I supposed to do? 
 But you can't force her to choose between... 
 Just drop it, okay? 
 She's pregnant. 
 It's a very complicated situation she's in. 
 She's killing herself, Angus. 
 I understand. 
 It's just if I were Carla, I would be really pissed off if I found out you were doing all of this behind my back. 
 I'll tell when it's over, when maybe we found a match, when I can show her that she still has a chance at life. 
 If you don't want to do this, okay, fine. Just leave. 
 No, hey, calm down. 
 I am here. 
 I'm sorry. 
 [ Chuckling ] It's okay. 
 [ Sighs ] 
 You watch. 
 I am gonna be a match. 
 Never won the lotto, but I'm gonna win this. 
 [ Laughs ] 
 Medics, report, please. 
 38-year-old female transfer from Venice Community Hospital. 
 Auto collision. Mom here was the driver. 
 Some neck stiffness. Kid was cleared. 
 Why the transfer? It seemed minor. 
 Venice isn't a trauma center. 
 Did the other doctors explain why they sent you here? 
 No, but they ruined our vacation. 
 Randell, please. 
 Someone just plowed right into us. 
 You guys don't seem to handle the rain very well down here. 
 Ooh. What... what are you doing? 
 I need a C-collar and a neuro ICU bed, please, right away. 
 Mom? 
 It's okay, honey. 
 The hospital they sent you to scanned your neck, but it appears I'm the first and only doctor to read the results. 
 And... and it's bad? 
 You have a cervical fracture. 
 You need a fixation device called a Halo to fix it. 
 You got it? I told you they were some cheap docin-a-box. 
 Randell, stop. 
 You're gonna need surgery tonight, Rebecca. 
 Wait! What about my son? 
 There's no one here with us. His father's in Portland. 
 Mom, do we have to stay here? 
 Uh, Dr. Taylor. 
 Some back-up in here, please. 
 Can you page social work? 
 I don't want a social worker. 
 It'll be tough to get one in code red. 
 Well, her husband's out of state. 
 Ex-husband. They're getting divorced. 
 [ Code bag beeping ] 
 Ugh, that's the code bag. I got to go. 
 You're gonna have to say goodbye to your mom for a little while. 
 Okay? Don't lose that ICU bed. Take her upstairs now. 
 Dr. Taylor. Can you handle the boy? 
 Absolutely not. 
 He's just kidding. 
 I got to go. 
 Wha... 
 Be good, randell. Okay? I'll see you soon. 
 Thank you for doing this! 
 Um... 
 Wow. This is, uh... this is awkward. 
 Will you take me to Grauman's Chinese? 
 That's where we were headed. 
 I'm working. 
 Do you have any idea what a job is? 
 Have you ever, you know, raked leaves or had a paper route? 
 What's a paper route? 
 God, I'm old. All right. 
 You just follow me and make sure you don't look at any of the gory stuff, all right? 
 Come on. Stay close. 
 Are you kidding me? We both have to sign just to get him a scan? 
 It's a double doc. What can I tell you? 
 Sign there, there, and there. 
 Hello. Remember me? 
 Just a second, Mr. Banks. 
 Hey, do you still have that ring? 
 What ring? 
 Oh, my God. These two kids came in earlier today. 
 Uh, did you ever see the last scene in "Titanic"? 
 Malaya said that's what happened out there. 
 Sorry. I've never seen that movie. 
 What? 
 Kate Winslet holding Leonardo Dicaprio's hand as he floats in the water, dying. 
 Yeah, so she can stay on the raft and live. 
 Absolutely amazing, right? 
 That raft was big enough for both of them, just so you know. 
 No, don't say that. That's wrong. 
 Okay, you know what? 
 We just brought our Leo back to life. 
 All right, gentlemen. What do you got? 
 Me. You've got me. 
 64-year-old man we brought in from the waiting room... 
 Why don't you say that a little louder so everyone can hear? 
 Hello, I'm Dr. Guthrie. 
 Ted Banks. It's nice to meet you. 
 Mario : He's complaining of fatigue. 
 I said exhaustion, not fatigue. 
 Blood pressure's normal. 
 Hmm. Well, you sound fine. 
 So what brings you in today, Mr. Banks? 
 I've been having these spells when I feel bone tired. 
 It's hard just getting across the room sometimes. 
 Anything else that you noticed? 
 Any fevers, chills, shortness of breath? 
 Shortness of breath, but just sometimes. 
 I'm always honest on the first date. 
 I'm HIV-positive. 
 Ooh, for how long? 
 Since the Reagan administration. 
 You're a survivor. 
 I am nothing if not that. 
 Let's draw labs on this lovely gentleman. 
 It's wonderful to meet you, Ted. 
 You, as well. Thank you.

 There. Back to normal. 
 Wonderful. Thank you. 
 He'll need a stat EKG and an ICU bed, but the worst is over. 
 So I'm just curious. 
 Dermatologists really don't know how to use a defibrillator? 
 I haven't done CPR in 20 years. 
 Policy is to call the code bag. 
 Hmm. Glad to be of help. 
 [ Knock on door ] 
 Why isn't Killian Wahler getting an O.R.? 
 His scan shows a grade 4 splenic laceration. 
 It was a grade 2, at best. 
 With cases like that, we like to wait. 
 They tend to get better on their own. 
 But I was just with him, and you weren't. 
 We keep gmng him fluids. He's not responding like I want. 
 I've seen hundreds of these. 
 You're undercalling it. He needs the knife. 
 I went down there, Leanne. I was with him. 
 And you're right. His exam was unimpressive. 
 Vitals are stable. 
 I'm sorry. 
 It doesn't warrant an immediate surgery. 
 What happened to you in San Francisco? 
 Nothing happened in San Francisco. 
 Doesn't sound like nothing. 
 Can't we disagree without impugning my integrity? 
 Look, I need to go to the O.R. 
 Uh, close the door when you're done.

 What does my bloodwork say? 
 Hasn't come back yet. 
 What does yours say? 
 Excuse me? 
 You got stuck, didn't you? 
 What are you gonna do about it? 
 I'm not gonna enter it into the system, that's for sure. 
 I'd have mounds of paperwork to fill out. 
 I'm gonna put you on a temporary pacemaker to see if we can get your heart rate up. 
 You're pretty cavalier about this. 
 It's low blood pressure. It's nothing to worry about. 
 I'm not talking about me.

 I have no idea. 
 Oscar Wilde. 
 You're not mad at me, are you? 
 Why would I be mad at you? 
 I don't know. 
 I screwed half the San Fernando Valley, and I just had a rotary telephone. 
 Imagine what I could have done with all the apps you kids have today. 
 Well, if you weren't careful, that's your business. 
 See? You are mad at me. 
 First of all, we didn't know. 
 And even if we did, are you telling me you never went out and did something you regretted the next day? 
 You never made a mistake? 
 I'm careful, if that's what you mean. 
 You weren't a little while ago, or we wouldn't be talking about this.

 Mama, curved Kelly, please. 
 Here you go, daddy. 
 Mama? Daddy? 
 What is up with that? 
 It's a long story. 
 Angus. 
 Retract harder. What's wrong with you? 
 You are tough. 
 Daddy. 
 Not as tough as this artery. 
 BP's coming up. 
 Angus : Phew! Just in time. 
 We were about a liter down. 
 [ Pager beeps ] Uh, one more suture. 
 Ah, damn it. I'm being paged. 
 Uh-oh. 
 We done here? 
 Okay, I'll be back to close up. 
 Damn, that was hot. 
 You're sweating. 
 It's warm in here. 
 It's 68 degrees in here. 
 I'm just saying. 
 You heard the man. Prep for closure. 
 Uh-huh. [ Chuckles ] 
 Is he gonna be okay? 
 You're Sophie. Killian's friend. 
 Yes. He should be just fine. 
 Let's get her back to her room. 
 Ted : What the hell are you doing anyway? 
 We're putting a catheter into your vein right below your right collarbone and snaking it to your heart to try to correct your heart rhythm. 
 It dances to its own drummer. 
 All right, Dr. Savetti. 
 You ready? 
 Insert the pacing catheter into the cordis and thread it into his right ventricle. 
 Good, good. Easy. 
 Let the EKG rhythm guide you. 
 Once you've reached the heart, the pace will normalize on its own. 
 He's mad at me, you know. 
 Would you stop saying that? 
 "Ann, please understand. 
 No one must be here. No one. 
 Be my best friend. 
 Go now, please." 
 "Dark Victory" again? 
 Oh, yes. The death scene. 
 There. 
 Good. 
 [ Chuckles ] 
 How are you feeling, Ted? 
 Ted? 
 Is he all right? 
 Yeah, he's just sleeping. We'll let him rest. 
 [ Sighs ] His generation of gay men... 
 It's the end of an era, you know? 
 Got a lot of people standing on their shoulders. 
 Why are you mad at him? 
 I'm not. 
 I'm mad at myself. 
 Don't you want to get some sleep? 
 It's 3:00 in the morning. 
 I just blew up three cars  and  got a hooker. 
 I'm not going to bed now. 
 Just checking. 
 Got any kids or a wife? 
 One wife, one kid. 
 [ Gunfire, woman screams ] 
 Your parents getting divorced? 
 I don't care. 
 Look, don't be a liar, kid. 
 My parents got divorced, and I cared. 
 What was it like? 
 Well, they feel really guilty, so you can get a lot of stuff if you play your cards right. 
 That's cool. 
 Yeah. 
 But they still love you just as much as they ever did. 
 [ Monitor beeping rapidly ] I was paged. 
 It's respiratory failure. 
 Patient just came back from the O.R. 
 Rebecca? Her sats are down to 76. 
 What happened? 
 Okay, I need suction now and intubation meds drawn up. 
 We don't intubate here. That's why we called you. 
 Can someone take that thing off? 
 We can't. Neuro has the key, and they haven't answered my page. 
 Look, I'll intubate her, but I absolutely need the wrench to unlock the Halo to do it. 
 I can't intubate with that Halo on. 
 Can't we just remove it manually? 
 It's screwed into the bone. I can't do it. 
 Go find that wrench! 
 [ Rebecca gasping ] 
 Leanne : Sophie, you're hyperventilating, okay? 
 Breathe slowly so that you don't pass out. 
 What the hell happened? 
 The skin is rock-hard tense. 
 Might be Early Compartment Syndrome. 
 No, it's too quick for that. 
 This is blood I'm feeling, not swelling. 
 She has a mid-shaft femur fracture. 
 It must have sheared off the vessels that run along the bone. 
 Oh, that would explain the blood pooling in her thigh. 
 She got up to walk. 
 Who let her do that? 
 She was insisting on finding her friend. 
 Is she your doctor or are you hers? 
 I put her on a gurney as soon as I could. 
 And you left her to watch center stage? 
 What if she had gotten up to move again? 
 I'm sorry, but that was the love of her life in there. 
 And now she's the one we have to save or she loses her lower leg. 
 No pulse down here. We have to get this leg straight. 
 She needs an emergent reduction. 
 Okay, Dr. Pineda, you with us? 
 Yes. 
 You've done this procedure before, right? 
 Yes. 
 Good. 
 You ready? 
 And 1, 2, 3. 
 [ Groans loudly ] 
 What's the problem? 
 I'm pulling, but nothing gives. 
 I think the bone is stuck. 
 I still don't feel a pulse. 
 Okay, let me try. Let me try. 
 Go. 
 [ Sophie groans ] 
 Damn it. It's not reducing. I don't know what's wrong. 
 What's wrong is the bone must be button-holed against a tendon, preventing it from moving. 
 She needs ortho and an O.R. now. 
 It's not gonna happen. 
 Blood pressure's dropping. 
 Okay, we can use the C-scope to help visualize the problem while we troubleshoot. 
 That's ortho. Do we even have one of those down here? 
 Yeah. Dr. Taylor uses it as a coat rack. 
 I haven't used one of those since med school. 
 I can do it. 
 I just finished my ortho rotation. 
 I assisted on dozens. 
 Well, what are you waiting for? Go get it! 
 I keep paging him. Nothing. 
 [ Monitor beeping rapidly ] 
 [ Cellphone beeps ] 
 [ Ringing ] Please pick up. 
 [ Cellphone buzzing ] 
 Leanne : Got it? 
 Neal : Got it. 
 [ Sighs ] Neal. 
 Pick up, pick up, pick up, pick up, pick up. 
 [ Monitor beeping rapidly ] [ Ringing ] 
 Pick up, pick up, pick up. 
 Did you page the Chief? Did you page maintenance? 
 Maintenance is working on it. 
 Sat is 60%. 
 Okay. I can't wait anymore. 
 I have no choice. I have to try. 
 I thought you said you couldn't do it. 
 Yeah, well, let's hope I was wrong. 
 Okay. See the meds I drew up? 
 Slam each into her I.V. now. 
 Her larynx muscles are too tense. 
 [ Gasping ] 
 Damn it. 
 Ugh! 
 Are you okay? 
 No. 
 I'm not. [ Sighs ] 
 We need her head angled back to do this. 
 The straight tube won't make a turn that easily. 
 [ Sighs ] Okay. 
 Okay. 
 [ Beeping continues ] 
 Sat is 40%. She is starting to brady down. 
 Get the crash cart ready. 
 Okay. 
 There! I got it. 
 Give me the bag. 
 [ Panting ] 
 [ Beeping slows ] 
 Sats are rising. Heart rate improving. 
 [ Panting ] 
 Malaya : Shall I advance the image? 
 Neal : Yep. 
 [ Keyboard clacks ] 
 Again. 
 There. See that fragment? 
 It's laced itself onto a tendon like a button fits into its hole. 
 We just have to pull exactly like this... 
 And move the joint inferiorly... 
 So that the fragment moves superiorly. 
 Superiorly. 
 [ Bone cracks ] 
 We have blood flow back. 
 Distal pulse is 2-plus. 
 I'll get a splint. 
 She still needs ortho, possible vascular. 
 Nice job. 
 [ Object thuds ] 
 Try not to paint yourself into a corner like that again. 
 What did you do? 
 What? 
 Okay, look. I don't want to get into your personal life. 
 What are you talking about? 
 If you're sleeping with dudes or whatever, hey, I don't care. 
 I didn't sleep around, all right? 
 Truvada? 
 You called in a prescription under my name? 
 It's a drug that gay guys take... 
 You think I would have used your number if I was hiding that? 
 I got stuck doing the labs on Ted. 
 What? Why didn't you tell me? 
 I couldn't find you. 
 Well, send me a text. 
 'Cause I just got a text from the pharmacy saying that I... 
 Why are you making such a big deal about this, huh? 
 Because I could really get in trouble. 
 Yeah, well, I could have gotten HIV from this guy, so I think we're even. 
 Okay, there's a less than 1% chance of seroconversion. 
 If you're on Truvada, it's even lower than that. 
 So not in the mood for a lecture. 
 Okay, this is not a lecture! See, this... this is talking. 
 It's what friends do. They talk. 
 Do you even know what it means to be a friend? 
 I mean, seriously. Have you ever had one before? 
 Screw you. 
 [ Door opens, closes ] 
 Hey. 
 She's gonna be all right. Don't be scared. 
 She's still in the head mask, okay? 
 He doesn't get scared. Do you, kid? 
 [ Respirator hissing ] 
 [ Monitor beeping ] 
 Neal : Hey. 
 Just, uh, just checking in. 
 I heard you had a tough one. 
 Ever put a square peg in a round hole? 
 Yeah, it was like that. 
 Look, I saw that you called. 
 I was busy, but the truth is, I'm not supposed to pick up the phone, anyway. 
 If you weren't ready to deal with the code bag on your own, you wouldn't be here. 
 Thanks... I guess. 
 We shouldn't have had those drinks. 
 Uh, it's made this whole thing rather awkward. 
 Not for me. 
 Neal, we ran into each other at breakfast and decided to have a few Bloody Marys. 
 What is awkward about that? 
 If you think my mind is on anything other than being the best possible doctor I can be, then you need to reconsider. 
 Can I just say one thing? 
 Mm-hmm. 
 You're already a legend downstairs. 
 A medical journal called. 
 Oh, you're full of it. 
 Yeah, but I had you for a second, didn't I? 
 Ugh. 
 Damn. 
 I'm sorry to have bothered you. 
 I was feeling a little nervous. 
 Vitals seem okay. 
 BP's a little low, but... 
 Want to take a breath? 
 I thought I came through that transvenous thing just fine. 
 You did. Sounds okay. 
 Tell me a story. 
 What? 
 A story. 
 About you. 
 Why me? 
 I mean, there's tons of doctors here. 
 I see you, and I feel like I'm looking at me at your age. 
 It's the same bravado, the steely eyes, the conquests, the wall around the heart. 
 You don't know a thing about me. 
 Then tell me a story about you. 
 No. 
 I don't have any stories. 
 Start with "I remember when"... 
 No. 
 I remember when my father bounced me on his knee. 
 I remember when I fell in love with my best friend. 
 I remember my 17th birthday. 
 I remember getting arrested. 
 Would you cut it out? 
 I remember trying pot for the first time. 
 Coke. 
 I remember the first time I kissed someone. 
 I remember that time I saw "Titanic". 
 Ah, you did, didn't you? 
 I remember when they forgot me. 
 It was on a Friday. I was in third grade. 
 They couldn't find my parents for the whole weekend. 
 I stayed with my teacher, Mrs. Clarke. 
 When they finally found my mother, I didn't want to go back. 
 Yeah, I wanted to stay with Mrs. Clarke, with her clean sheets... Full refrigerator. 
 We're the same, kiddo. 
 Exactly the same. 
 You're right, by the way. 
 That raft was big enough for the both of them. 
 [ Both chuckle ] 
 Mm. 
 Some advice from future you, Dr. Savetti.

 Jesse : I went over to phlebotomy. 
 They're not taking any more swabs. 
 Carla shut it down. She wants to save the baby. 
 The problem with medicine is sometimes, there's no good answer. 
 It's amazing you two lasted as long as you did. 
 Who? Carla and I? 
 You're a thinker. She's a feeler. 
 You want her to listen to all the percentages, the studies. 
 Get her as many more years as you can. 
 What's wrong with that? 
 She's feeling something inside of her. 
 That's what she's listening to now. 
 That's how she's gonna make sense of what's left of her life. 
 Try to understand that. 
 I can't. 
 She's given up already. 
 I don't know how to do that. 
 So I had a near-death experience, huh? 
 It wasn't near. It was the real deal. 
 I don't remember any of it, though. 
 Just know that you were fearless. 
 You did everything you could to save her, and you did.

 [ Sniffles ] 
 Yes. [ Sniffles ] 
 How are they doing? 
 They're alive. They're in love. 
 It's a pretty good combination. 
 At least somebody's happy. 
 Bad day? 
 Ah, that kid I was looking after... 
 I let him watch center stage from the observation deck. 
 I, uh... 
 I got to go to a hearing on Friday. 
 No good deed goes unpunished. 
 Nope.

 Yeah. The  Wet Drea.

 His heart just finally gave out. 
 There was someone he told us to call.

 Soon. 
 Would you like to go out with me sometime? 
 Excuse me? 
 Lunch? 
 Maybe a night before a day off. 
 No. I don't. 
 Why? 
 Is it because I'm black? 
 Because I have a temper? 
 You're Guthrie's son, for starters. 
 And... I don't go out. 
 Ever. 
 Look, I know about what happened to you. 
 The accident. 
 I'm sorry. 
 Look, when I was 15, I found my mother lying on the bathroom floor in a pool of blood with a gun in her hand.

 Uh... 
 Good night, doctor. 
 You know, it's okay. You're just not ready yet. 
 Have a good morning.
