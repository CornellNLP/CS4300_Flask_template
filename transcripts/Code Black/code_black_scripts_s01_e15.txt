 Previously on "Code Black"... 
 Dr. Pineda. 
 Gordon. 
 I'm surprised you remember me. 
 It was just yesterday. 
 What's going on, Dr. Pineda? 
 This is Gordon. He's a patient. 
 You shouldn't be in here. Let's go. Out. 
 A little rude, isn't it? 
 [Pager beeps] 
 [Gasps] 
 You have an attitude problem. 
 [Gasps] Oh! 
 [Gasping] 
 Look, I don't want to talk about this anymore. 
 I already gave a statement to the cops. 
 Things happened fast, but we did everything we could. 
 Anyone who says otherwise is wrong. 
 I was upset. We all were. 
 When a patient is... more than a patient... 
 I know this is difficult. 
 I'm sorry, um, I don't why we're doing this. 
 After a tragedy like this, the hospital has to conduct its own internal review. 
 And we've learned a lot in the past couple of days. 
 These are photos from hospital surveillance cameras. 
 The day it happened, here he is outside the break room. 
 He's watching Doctors Perello and Pineda. 
 Here he is a few days earlier in the hallway behind Dr. Pineda. 
 And another... five weeks ago. 
 Four days before that. Again, following her. 
 So far, we've counted 17 different times Gordon Heshman's been here in the past two months. 
 [Elevator bell dings] 
 Man : 12-hour day, have to be back in another six. 
 Where you going? 
 Uh, same. 
 Gordon : [Grunts] 
 Oh. [Panting] 
 Hey. 
 Gordon? 
 Dr. Pineda. 
 Floor? 
 Uh, B4. 
 It's a party. 
 [Elevator beeps] 
 Uh, just glad I'm feeling better, though, thanks to you. 
 [Chuckles] 
 I almost forgot. 
 I... [Chuckles] 
 [Elevator bell dings] 
 I parked on a different floor today. 
 [Elevator doors open] 
 Okay. Bye. 
 Um, glad to hear you're feeling better. 
 Yeah. 
 Hey. 
 [Laughs] 
 What's going on? 
 I... I... I know this is... this is gonna be out of the blue, but, um... 
 You want to grab a drink or something? 
 God, I'm... 
 I'm sorry, Gordon, but we're not supposed to do that. 
 You know, doctors and patients. 
 [Scoffs] Fascists. 
 [Chuckles] And you know, uh, what... what they don't know is that there's this great place in Koreatown that has the most... 
 Gordon, I can't. I'm sorry. 
 If you don't like Korean food, you know... 
 [Sighs] The other thing is, I'm not into guys. 
 I'm gay. 
 Okay. You don't have to do that. 
 Do what? 
 Lie! 
 If you don't want to go out with me, you... 
 You... you could just say so. 
 I'm not lying. 
 Right. Whatever you say. 
 I'm sorry to bother you. 
 You didn't, Gordon.

 [Suspenseful music plays] 
 [Button clicking] 
 Hang on a second. Do I need a lawyer here? 
 We are just trying to understand. 
 'Cause it sounds like I'm being accused of something. 
 No one's accusing you of anything, but you are entitled to have a lawyer with you if you want. 
 At that point, I didn't know about Malaya. 
 I had my hands full with Gina. 
 Christa found her. 
 [Sighs] 
 She'd been stabbed eight times in the abdomen. 
 She lost pulse. We got her to center stage. 
 [Monitors beeping] 
 IV, o2, six units of blood, clear the scanners. 
 I need a portable chest. Dr. Lorenson, fast ultrasound. 
 What the hell? What happened? 
 Who did this? 
 Dr. Savetti, pressure on these wounds. 
 Risa, page surgery for a T.T.A. 
 Who did this?! 
 Savetti! 
 Follow my voice. We've got to be quick. 
 It's Dr. Perello. 
 We need to control this bleeding. 
 Help Dr. Lorenson tie off anything that needs it. 
 Clamp! 
 Somebody get Hudson. Is Dr. Rorish still here? 
 Is Rorish still here? 
 Rorish is gone. 
 Mario. Change of plans. Right-sided chest tube. 
 Place it. 
 No, the E.R. director is on the table. 
 Gina Perello  is  the trauma. 
 [Monitors beeping] 
 All right, how much output on that side? 
 750 cc, at least. 
 Oh, hell. Blood! 
 Christa, repeat the fast over her chest. 
 Where is the surgical attending? 
 He's finishing an aortic rupture. 
 They'll have an O.R. ready in 15. 
 I don't have 15 minutes. Mario, is that tube up high, nice and posterior? 
 Come on, you guys. 
 Clear the way! I got blood! 
 Yeah, I checked the tract with my finger. 
 Superior and posterior. 
 I'm about 12 in... blood still returning. 
 Free fluid on both sides. 
 Damn it! Uh... 
 Have either of you ever done a clamshell? 
 Okay. Gown up. 
 Wait, you want to do a clamshell down here? 
 We're  gonna do it here. 
 That's when we all heard the screaming. 
 [ Woman's scream echoes ] 
 Neal :  Call security now! 
 I said call security! 
 What the hell's going on out there? 
 Clear the path, please. Clear, clear! 
 [Screams] 
 Oh, my God. 
 Malaya! 
 Breathe, Malaya. 
 What happened?! 
 You're okay, Malaya. Let's get her hooked up, please. 
 Woman : Here. Someone get me a warming blanket. 
 [Whimpering] 
 Is that Gina? 
 [Gasping] 
 Malaya! 
 Dr. Lorenson! Dr. Lorenson, stay with me! 
 Has anyone called the police? 
 Whoever did this could still be in the building! 
 Mario : More gauze. 
 We got to handle this bleeding, folks. 
 More suction. That's it. 
 [Monitors beeping] 
 Clear the field. 
 I need 10-blade, rib spreader, the whole tray. 
 Christa : Hang on, Gina. 
 Whoa. Didn't you page a T.T.A.? 
 It's Gina. 
 Stab wounds to the chest and abdomen. 
 Can't wait for your attending. 
 He's not coming. He's finishing up a ruptured triple-a. 
 I'm here to take her up and he'll swing O.R.s. 
 That's not an option anymore. 
 That window has closed. 
 We're doing the surgery here. 
 She'll be under Campbell's knife in seven minutes. 
 That's what your department said 15 minutes ago. 
 Savetti, zip it. 
 Have you ever done a clamshell? 
 She has a pulse. Let me take her. 
 She needs to go to the O.R. Campbell said that... 
 Campbell isn't here! 
 See that free fluid? She's in peri-arrest. 
 I'm calling him. 
 Good! Tell him I'm starting the procedure. 
 Get me Campbell now. 
 You ready? 
 What did you just say to me? 
 Is that when you decided to break from the standard protocol? 
 Who is this guy? 
 Uh, "break from the standard protocol"? 
 Do you even know what the standard protocol is? 
 He did what he had to do. 
 Really? 
 You performed an E.R. thoracotomy without the technical indication for one. 
 The rules are very clear. 
 Unless a patient is in cardiac arrest, they go to to the O.R. 
 She was in peri-arrest. 
 Center stage is where rules go to die. 
 Her chest tube put out over two liters. 
 That's a massive hemorrhage. She couldn't wait. 
 We're just trying to understand your decision-making process. 
 You'd have to be a doctor to do that. 
 Leanne No. I'm not okay with this at all. 
 [Scoffs] Outside. 
 You are on the wrong side of this. 
 No, you're on the wrong side. 
 What the hell is this? 
 It's an interview. 
 It's an interrogation. 
 Let me tell you something about that doctor in there... 
 He's reckless. 
 He did exactly what I would have done, which is why he has the job. 
 And can I remind you, a week ago, you were his biggest cheerleader. 
 That was before he was involved in the death of the E.R. director. 
 He wasn't  involved  in her death. 
 He tried to save her life, and you're treating him like a criminal. 
 I'm treating him like a criminal because they will treat him like one. 
 I'm preparing him for the slaughter. 
 You really think this will end up in a courtroom? 
 Everything ends up in a courtroom. 
 My job and first and foremost to protect this hospital. 
 I don't know how you do it. 
 Well, same way that you will. 
 What? 
 I need you to take over the department... Gina's job. 
 No. Absolutely not. 
 Not a request, sorry. 
 No. 
 You still have a contract with this hospital, and I can't let you go. Not now. 
 I'm not an administrator, Ed. I'm a doctor. 
 So was Mark Taylor. So was Gina. 
 Look, no one knows trauma one like you, and it's just till Taylor returns. 
 I's not forever. 
 That's what they said about Afghanistan. 
 We were in the middle of shift change. 
 Some of our resources weren't on the floor at the time. 
 And when Dr. Pineda was brought in? 
 ♪ 
 What's the question? 
 Where were you when Dr. Pineda was brought in? 
 Nobody brought her in. 
 She made it on her own. 
 You went too fast, you should have stayed with me. 
 Malaya : Help! Help me! 
 [Gasping] 
 Malaya! 
 Amy, get a gurney now! 
 [Gasping] 
 Who did this to you? 
 A patient. Gordon Heshman. 
 Call security now. 
 I already did. 
 I grabbed a security phone in the stairwell. 
 Let's move to center stage. I said call security! 
 Woman : Yes, Doctor! 
 [Gasping] Okay, Malaya. Malaya. 
 You're safe now. 
 Malaya. Malaya, listen to me! 
 You hold steady. I need to make sure it didn't violate the fascia. 
 A voice inside my head said, "run," so I ran. 
 Don't look at the monitor... check a pulse. 
 I just ran. 
 Looks intact, Jesse. 
 Man : Where? 
 He's still down there. 
 I know. I know. I know. 
 Angus : Move! Get out of the way. Move! 
 Guys, we go to bed 2. 
 [Malaya gasps] 
 Malaya. Is she okay? 
 [Breathing quickly] 
 That's him! That's him! 
 Okay, Malaya. Okay. 
 Oh, my God! Get away! 
 Malaya! Malaya! 
 Jesse, hold her down, please. 
 Let go of me! 
 Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. 
 Malaya, Malaya. 
 He attacked her! 
 Can you please... I can't be here next to him. 
 Neal : Okay, Malaya. Okay. 
 I can't be here! No! No! 
 Malaya. You got to get her out of here right now. 
 No! Let go of me! 
 Angus : Get her out of here! 
 Get me away from him! Get me away! 
 Neal : Malaya! I'm stapling. Hold still for me. 
 Dr. Leighton! 
 Hold still. 
 No! Get him away! 
 Dr. Lorenson, give him a hand. 
 Get him away! Run it down for me, Angus. 
 Christa : We need to move her as soon as possible. 
 Pulse-less male. Single stab wound to the neck. 
 Probably P.E.A. arrest. 
 I'll take the primary survey and fast exam. 
 You take the neck? 
 I need a lac tray, two units of o-neg. 
 Call a T.T.A. 
 Jesse : Stay down, Malaya. Stay down! 
 Malaya : No! Let get of me! 
 You've got to get her out of here! 
 Hold her down, please. 
 Jesse, hold her down. 
 I'm taking her to sides. I'll finish the dressing there. 
 Okay. Guys, go! 
 Okay. We've got it. We've got it. 
 We've got you, Malaya. We've got you. Come on. 
 [Monitors beeping] 
 Okay, someone get me gown. Now, please. 
 ♪ 
 And that's when you joined the surgical intervention on Dr. Gina Perello? 
 Dr. Leighton needed an extra set of hands. 
 Surgery couldn't get there in time. 
 Dr. Campbell contests that. 
 Dr. Harbert, why don't you let him answer? 
 Continue, please. 
 We were the ones up to our elbows in blood. 
 Okay, Dr. Pinkney, extend the incision down the right side. 
 Savetti, help her. Neal, you got my back? 
 Right here. 
 Holy She's got a massive hemothorax here. 
 And we're filling up the suction vac. 
 I think her right diaphragm is ruptured. 
 She's also bleeding from her abdomen. 
 She needs the incision extended to an ex-lap. 
 Woman : More suction. 
 Neal, you got it? 
 She's got a lac to one of her pulmonary veins up here. 
 I'm stuck. 
 [Sighs] 
 Man : Give me another lac tray, please. 
 Hepatic source, likely. 
 Put the gauze there. I'm gonna put this on top of it. 
 Open up a surgical tray. 
 Hemostat, please. 
 Damn this. 
 Woman : Surgery is here. Dr. Campbell. 
 What the hell do you think you're doing? 
 Glove up. Multi-trauma to the left chest and right diaphragm. 
 Peri-arrest. She was about to crash. 
 We're in a thoracotomy and ex-lap now. 
 This is insane! Dr. Leighton? 
 Drop what you're doing and get the hell out of the way now. 
 Pinkney, suction. 
 Yes, sir. 
 Move. Move, move. Move, move. 
 Stop barking! You don't have the authority to... 
 The hell I don't. 
 Enough! Just keep it civil here, okay? 
 Civil, huh? 
 I walk into the E.D. to find surgery going on with no surgeons. 
 That's not entirely accurate. 
 I completed a surgical residency before I switched. 
 Surgical residency, huh? I'm  so  relieved. 
 I need laps. 
 More, more, more, more. 
 [Flatline] 
 We've lost pulse. 
 We made the right call. 
 I agree. 
 And waiting for surgery? 
 Again, not an option. 
 God. What a mess. 
 She needs another round of intracardiac epi. 
 Man : I can't tie this. 
 Woman : I'm done. Stop it. 
 You should know better. 
 This was my call, not hers. 
 I know. If it were, she'd be out of a job. 
 Still may be. 
 Man : More suction here. 
 Christa, pulse check. 
 ♪ 
 [Indistinct talking] 
 Man : I'm trying. 
 Woman : Get ready when I break out compressions. 
 How long without a heartbeat? 
 21 minutes. 
 She's gone. 
 Call it. 
 Any other suggestions? 
 Just call it. 
 [Sighs] 
 Time of death 5:43 A.M. 
 ♪ 
 [Crying, sniffling] 
 Man : I have 35 sutures. 
 Woman : Try clamping. 
 Another round of epi! 
 I did. The blood still floods the field! 
 That is eviscerated. 
 I know. 
 Hold it there. 
 Mario : Do we, uh, have to leave the chest tubes in? 
 Everything stays in for the M.E. Just like any other patient. 
 I just don't feel right about this. 
 I know. But you should. 
 We, um, we take care of them the say way in death as we do in life. 
 And we always take care of our own. 
 Uh... We did absolutely everything we could have. 
 Yeah? 
 She deserved that. 
 ♪ 
 As far as I'm concerned, she was assaulted twice... 
 Once by that lunatic and then again by her own doctors. 
 Don't you think you're being a little dramatic? 
 No, I don't. 
 Dr. Campbell, do you believe doctors Leighton and Hudson were negligent? 
 The physicians in Trauma One think center stage is an operating room. 
 Is that so? 
 Oh, you always have. 
 All surgeons are physicians. 
 Not all physicians are surgeons. 
 And all surgeons can't do what we do. 
 And what is that, exactly? 
 The work of a surgeon in a battlefield setting, blind with one arm tied behind our back. 
 I know my people. If they hadn't have acted... 
 She might still be alive. 
 I would like to suggest that we be very careful here. 
 Agreed. 
 All I know is that I inherited the  Titanic. 
 Dr. Campbell... 
 You're speculating, are you not? 
 They weren't the iceberg. 
 That was that maniac with the knife. 
 But they were certainly not the rescue ship she needed. 
 ♪ 
 Dr. Campbell. 
 Neal : Mike... Mike. 
 Where do you get off blaming us for this? 
 We tried to save her life. 
 Nobody doubts your intentions. Of course. 
 You... you thought you were saving her. 
 That's not the point. 
 She needed an O.R. She needed to be on bypass. 
 She needed the proper techs and nurses. 
 We're better equipped. 
 Protocol says she goes upstairs. 
 And the protocol would have killed her. 
 So instead you did. 
 We gave Gina the best chance to survive. 
 And the proof of that is a dead woman. 
 I've been a surgeon here at Angels for 12 years. 
 Operated on movie stars, billionaires, the Vice President of the United States. 
 Meanwhile, the sum total of your experience here is as an E.R. resident, my man. 
 It's been a long time since I was a resident, my man. 
 I'm a doctor, same as you. 
 Ah, no. No. 
 See, your patients come to you 'cause they have to. 
 My patients come to me because they choose to. 
 Mario : That guy's a joke, Heather. 
 [Monitor beeping] 
 He's not a joke. He's an amazing surgeon. 
 He won the Jama Award. 
 He flies to Johns Hopkins once a month to lecture. 
 He works with Jhpiego helping kids in Africa. 
 Does he make you say all that during s*x? 
 You didn't seem like the jealous type. 
 You know, you're the one that said that we can't keep doing this, so I don't know why you're so bent out of shape. 
 I'm not. 
 Woman : Okay, uh. 
 
 
 
 [Indistinct conversations] 
 Look, you ask me, Dr. Leighton and Dr. Hudson did everything they could to save Gina's life. 
 Thank you, Dr. Savetti. 
 [Sighs] 
 Campbell's just trying to cover his own ass. 
 Dr. Savetti, we wanted to ask you about Gordon Heshman. 
 [Camera shutter clicks] 
 What about him? 
 I need to understand how he slipped in here 17 times without anyone raising a flag. 
 [Camera shutter clicks] 
 17 times? As a patient? 
 Sometimes he just wandered the halls. 
 He also sought treatment a number of times under a variety of aliases. 
 Always used the same birth date. 
 [Camera shutter clicks] 
 Two months ago, you were his doctor. 
 You and Dr. Lorenson treated him. 
 Do you remember him? 
 Two months ago? 
 You know, I treat a hundred patients a day, every day. 
 No, I don't remember him. 
 Did you see Mr. Heshman when Dr. Pineda was treating him the night she was attacked? 
 No. 
 I did. 
 But I didn't recognize him. 
 You were treating a patient in the very next bed. 
 Are you saying that I should have recognized him? 
 No one is saying that, Dr. Savetti. 
 Oh, God. 
 What is it, Christa? 
 I thought I heard yelling in the locker room. 
 Gina : [Muffled] Why are you wearing scrubs? 
 What do you think you're doing? 
 That's why you went in to investigate? 
 No, sorry. I... I went in later at the end of my shift. 
 I heard the yelling about an hour earlier when I was walking by the locker room. 
 I heard Gina yelling at someone. 
 You might have heard the moment of the attack. 
 Why didn't you go in there when you heard the yelling? 
 Well, if I had known... 
 No one is suggesting you could have done anything. 
 She was in a bad mood that day. 
 Gina, she... she got angry at me early in the shift, and at Malaya in the break room. 
 I'm not saying she was mean or anything, but she could be... she was frustrated that day. 
 Gina : [Muffled] You're a doctor and he clearly likes you. 
 I don't care if it's innocent. 
 You don't want to give him the wrong impression. 
 He's not your friend. 
 Trust me on this, Malaya. 
 As a woman, you have to be aware that the appearance of a situation sometimes matters just as much as the real. 
 She was tough. I liked her. 
 What was she yelling at you for? 
 Christa : She wasn't yelling. 
 It was just a heated conversation. 
 Gina : This thing between you and Dr. Hudson. 
 She thought I'd kept a patient in sides too long. 
 What? 
 No, no, no. Don't make it worse, okay? 
 I see you two together. I'm not blind. 
 Kind of just started. 
 I don't care. 
 Are you aware that the hospital has rules regarding the fraternization between residents and attendings? 
 Yes. 
 And yet here we are. 
 Like I said, it just started. 
 Well, if it's going to continue, you will have to fill out paperwork and let H.R. know. 
 What? Are you kidding? 
 If I were kidding, this would be funny, but unfortunately, the hospital takes this kind of thing very seriously, Dr. Lorenson. 
 I have to talk to Neal. 
 Dr. Hudson. 
 Okay. You do that. 
 But either you disclose it to H.R. discreetly or I will make an example of you two. 
 Or you could break it off. Those are your options. 
 [Monitor beeping] 
 She's already gone through this with the police. 
 Do we really need to... ? 
 Yes. We do. 
 Dr. Pineda, we are trying to understand what happened to Mr. Heshman before he was brought in to trauma one. 
 We know this is difficult. 
 You don't have to do this. 
 No, it's okay. 
 I can do it. [Clears throat] 
 I can do it. 
 I... I was so scared. 
 I wanted to yell, but I couldn't. 
 He was on top of me. 
 [Gordon grunts] 
 [Inhales deeply] 
 I remember the sound of my pants ripping. 
 [Gasping] 
 [Grunting] 
 [Screams] 
 [Fabric tears] 
 [Grunting] 
 Aah! No! 
 Angus : [Distorted voice] Malaya, run! Run! 
 [Panting] 
 I found her phone in the break room. 
 She's, um... she's always forgetting it. 
 So I ran downstairs to catch her before she left. 
 Gordon : Stuck-up bitch! 
 Malaya : [Gasping] 
 [Grunting] 
 Hey! 
 Run, Malaya! Run! 
 [Gagging] 
 Oh, my God. 
 [Sighs] The knife in his neck. 
 [Gagging] 
 Oh, my God. 
 No, that was an accident. We... we wrestled. 
 Of course. Of course it was an accident. 
 No one is accusing you of anything. 
 Isn't that right? 
 Just tell us what happened. 
 I tried to stop him. 
 But, uh... 
 He just yanked it out. 
 No. No, no, no, no, no! 
 Don't pull that knife! 
 Oh, my God. 
 Gordon : [Gagging] 
 Oh, my God. 
 [Door opens] 
 Hold on. Hold on. 
 I need a gurney! Help! 
 He lost pulse. 
 I couldn't start CPR because I had to hold pressure, too. 
 I tried to do both. 
 When help arrived, I started CPR, and then we got him to center stage. 
 I mean, maybe I could have done more. 
 But, uh... 
 I was out of my mind. 
 Any of us would have been, Angus. 
 You saved Malaya's life. 
 Mario : Look, I already told you. 
 Two months ago is a long time in this place. 
 We have the chart here to refresh your memory. 
 He came in under the name Ian McGreedy. 
 Do you remember him? 
 Yeah. I think so. 
 [Sighs] 
 20 of etomidate, 120 of sux. 
 [Alarm beeping] 
 Pushing now. 
 Mister, uh... McGreedy. 
 Mr. McGreedy, stay with us now! 
 [Coughs] 
 Okay, tube, please. 
 Any idea what he took? 
 Looks like some kind of carbamate, possibly rodenticide. 
 Rat poison? 
 Tres Pasitos. 
 Three Little Steps. 
 It's a Mexican rodent killer. 
 'Cause a mouse can only take three steps before it drops dead. 
 You can't get it in the States anymore. 
 Not... not legally. 
 But Gordon did. 
 Any muscle weakness should abate in a day or two. 
 Now, the labs can't confirm anything for a few more days, especially without an actual sample of the poison. 
 I had tacos from a street vendor. 
 You must see this kind of thing all the time. 
 Not really. I'll notify the sheriff. 
 I... I'm sure it was an accident. 
 I'm not... I don't want to get anybody in trouble here. 
 For now, we're gonna keep you for observation. 
 I... I want Dr. Pineda. 
 Excuse me? 
 I'm sorry. I just... I would feel more comfortable with her. 
 And I would feel more comfortable with a chilled cerveza and a view of the beach, but that's not how it works around here. 
 You don't get to pick your doctor. Hang tight. 
 [Monitor beeping] 
 [Sighs] 
 He asked for Malaya. 
 [Sighs] 
 [Metal creaking] 
 [Indistinct conversations] 
 [Knocks on door] 
 [Sighs] 
 How you doing? 
 Fine. 
 How's Angus doing? 
 He's good. 
 Doesn't like being called a hero. 
 [Scoffs] 
 I guess he'll have to get used to it. 
 This is my fault. 
 Your fault? How is this your fault? 
 He's come around before asking for you. 
 I should have known something was up with him. 
 Jesse, stop. 
 I'm the only one to blame. 
 It's my fault this happened to me, and it's my fault what happened to Gina. 
 Malaya, that man... 
 The first time I treated him, he flirted with me. 
 He hugged me. 
 I had a twinge that something was off, but I didn't listen to it. 
 I felt bad for him. I encouraged him. 
 Then in the parking garage, I knew something was wrong. 
 [Voice breaking] My skin was crawling, but still I had to be polite. 
 You were just being the good person that you are. 
 He took that and he turned that into something ugly. 
 He  did that. 
 Now, playing that tape over and over in your head isn't good for anything. 
 [Sighs] 
 Don't let this change you. 
 Don't let this destroy the goodness that's in you. 
 That would be the real tragedy. 
 [Sniffles] 
 You know I love you, right? 
 You know that? 
 Can we talk? 
 No. 
 Okay. 
 You all right? 
 No. Someone died. 
 The last thing I want is to talk about you and me. 
 I was asking about you. 
 I don't need your concern right now. 
 I just need to be left alone. 
 So you can blame yourself? 
 [Sighs] You were upset with Gina. 
 That doesn't make what happens your fault. 
 I wasn't mad at Gina. 
 I... 
 I was upset about what happened with us. 
 I was mad at  you. 
 Gina knows. God, she is such a killjoy. 
 [Chuckles] 
 Oh, God. I can just see the way Rorish is gonna look at me. 
 Let me talk to her. 
 Human resources workplace relationship disclosure form. 
 Romantic, right? 
 She wants it signed and in her inbox by end of shift. 
 You signed this? 
 Yeah, of course I did. 
 You sign it and it stays quiet and we can tell everyone on our own terms. 
 If you don't want to... 
 No, I understand. 
 Then here. 
 Well, we should probably talk about it. 
 It's not a marriage license. 
 You know what? Take your time. 
 Wouldn't want to make you do anything you're not ready for. 
 And what upsets me more than anything else is that while Gina's dead and Malaya is lying upstairs bruised and beaten, I'm thinking about us. 
 Dr. Lorenson, thank you for coming back. 
 We have a few more questions, specifically about Gordon Heshman. 
 You and Dr. Angus Leighton treated him in center stage, correct? 
 ♪ 
 [Monitor beeping] 
 Yes. 
 Was there an attending supervising? 
 Dr. Mike Leighton and Dr. Neal Hudson. 
 But they were tending to other patients, so you and Angus Leighton were working alone? 
 Standard operating procedure. They're doctors. 
 I'm simply trying to ascertain whether the two residents treating Mr. Heshman were capable. 
 They're more than capable. 
 [Clattering echoes] 
 You are friends with Dr. Pineda? 
 Yes. 
 Dr. Leighton found her being attacked by Mr. Heshman. 
 You found Dr. Perello... Gina stabbed allegedly by Heshman. 
 Then you found yourselves faced with having to save his life. 
 That must have been difficult. 
 We did our best. 
 A staff member claims to have overheard you make a statement that could call that into question. 
 Please. This line of questioning is obscene. 
 Damn it. I can't do this. 
 Angus, please be steady. 
 I can't stop compressions. 
 I can't do a figure-eight suture with the field moving, okay? 
 Mike : Hey, hey, hey. Angus, he's a patient, man. 
 Remember what mom always says? 
 Check your own pulse first, right? 
 Now do something for me. 
 30 seconds till pulse check. 
 Another one of epi, please. 
 Pick up the needle driver. 
 [Sighs] 
 Think about all the times you tied your shoes. 
 You don't think about tying your shoes, right? 
 No. 
 You just do it. 
 It's muscle memory. 
 Body ahead of your brain. 
 [Christa breathing heavily] 
 Okay. 
 Cut here, please. 
 Pulse check. 
 [Monitor beeping] 
 [Breathlessly] Got it. Bounding. 
 You okay? 
 I can't believe we have to save this guy. 
 "I can't believe we have to save this guy"... end quote. 
 Did you hear Dr. Lorenson's comment? 
 Can I just say again that this is total and complete crap? 
 People say a lot of things in the heat of... 
 Yes, you've made your disapproval quite plain. 
 I didn't hear it, no, but what I saw was her and Angus Dr. Leighton... 
 Move heaven and earth to save his life, regardless of what he'd done. 
 It doesn't matter what she  said. 
 I saw what she  did. 
 And Mike Leighton? 
 Dr. Leighton isn't a surgeon, which makes what he did all the more remarkable. 
 Dr. Pinkney said the same thing. 
 His efforts brought Gina back from certain death. 
 He kept her alive long enough that Dr. Campbell's expertise might tip the chance of her survival in her favor. 
 Her death isn't a mar on anyone's record. 
 You can debate that with Campbell. 
 Oh, I have. 
 We all know he's an egomaniac of the highest order. 
 But this? This isn't about Gina. 
 This is about... [Scoffs] 
 What does it matter now, anyway? 
 Uh, respectfully, are we done here? 
 I appreciate what you did for Gina. 
 You're a good surgeon. 
 But you're not a surgeon at  this  hospital. 
 No more surgery for you unless you are expressly given privileges. 
 Ah... [Sighs] 
 Understood. 
 Thank you, Dr. Hudson. 
 [Sighs] 
 There is one more thing. 
 Dr. Christa Lorenson and I are in a relationship. 
 That signed document should put everything above board. 
 [Chuckles] Thank you, Dr. Hudson. 
 [Distorted conversations] 
 ♪ 
 I haven't told you today how nice you look. 
 You rock the scrubs, but this suits you. 
 Thanks, Mike. You buttering me up? 
 No, ma'am. 
 Yes. Yes, I am. 
 Jesse told me that Harbert's making you stay on as E.R. director. 
 Please don't fight it. 
 But this place means too much to me to leave it like this. 
 I'm staying for now. 
 Good. 'Cause, selfishly, I need you here. 
 The last few days have shown me I left the right person in charge of the residents. 
 I'm gonna trust your judgment on that. 
 Still feels like there are some who wish I wasn't here. 
 Not naming names... Harbert. 
 I can handle Harbert. 
 Good. 
 Thank you, Daddy. 
 You have a moment? 
 I just come from ICU. 
 Gordon Heshman's not doing well. 
 As healers, we fight death every day. 
 That doesn't mean I'm not hoping he dies. 
 Better for Malaya. Maybe you, too. 
 You've been through a lot, Angus. 
 I'm okay. 
 You know better than to lie to your mama. 
 Mario. You heading out? 
 Yep. 
 I don't have anything going on tonight. 
 I thought maybe... 
 Campbell bail on you? 
 Mario, cut it out. 
 Cut what out? I got to bolt. 
 [Indistinct conversations] 
 [Monitor beeping] 
 Hey. 
 I caught an emergency appendectomy. 
 You want to scrub in? 
 Oh, I can't. I have rounds to finish before I head out. 
 You know, my record's 45 minutes open to close. 
 I think I can beat it. 
 So if you want to order me a drink, I'll join you as soon as I can. 
 I can't make it tonight. 
 I think I need a night in. 
 I'm just, you know, exhausted. 
 You're too young to be exhausted. 
 [Door opens] 
 All right, Dr. Pinkney, thank you for passing this along. 
 Now, if you'll excuse me, I got a record to break.

 Gina loved daisies. 
 She said they were uncomplicated but wild. 
 [Chuckles] 
 ♪ 
 I didn't know you were seeing her. 
 [Scoffs] 
 I'm sorry for your loss. 
 What are you doing here? 
 I never got to say goodbye. 
 Neither did I. 
 [Monitor beeping] 
 Psst. 
 Hawaiian burger? 
 You didn't happen to get a milkshake, did you? 
 What kind of friend do you think I am? 
 The best kind. 
 [Chuckles] 
 No,  you're  the best kind. [Chuckles] 
 No, I'm not. 
 He could have killed you, Angus. 
 Yeah, but he didn't. 
 He could have killed us. 
 Hey. 
 He didn't. 
 I'm sorry I left you alone with him. 
 I'm not. 
 That's why I yelled for you to run. 
 [Sighs] 
 He's dead, Malaya. 
 ICU just called. 
 It's over now. 
 Hey, uh, if you don't eat this, I'm going to. 
 Don't you dare. 
 [Chuckles] 
 Let's get you some food. 
 [Man speaking indistinctly] 
 [Clattering echoes] 
 Hey, I heard. How you holding up? 
 Talk to me. 
 You understand this guy got what he deserves, right? 
 Totally. 
 You saved her, Angus. 
 But not just her. 
 This guy would have done this over and over again. 
 So you saved them all. 
 Don't you forget that. 
 You didn't tell her, did you? 
 Of course not. 
 You can't tell anyone. 
 [Malaya grunting] 
 Not your best friend, not your shrink. 
 You and I take this to our graves. 
 Agreed? 
 Oh, my God. 
 No, no, no, no, no! 
 Don't pull that knife! 
 Oh, my God. 
 Come on. 
 That bitch. That bitch. 
 What did you say? 
 I'm gonna kill that bitch.

 Help me. 
 Help. Help me. 
 Help me. Help me.

 Help! I need a gurney!
