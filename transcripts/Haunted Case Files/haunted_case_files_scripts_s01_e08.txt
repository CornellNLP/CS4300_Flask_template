 Narrator : America's top ghost hunters relive their most extreme assignments. 
 (Woman screams) 
 This house is beyond haunted. 
 Narrator : Hardened veterans of the paranormal, these are the cases that truly tested them. 
 There was a evil presence in that house. 
 Woman : Oh,  (bleep)  what the hell? 
 Man : Dude, I got goose bumps. 
 It's in here. 
 Narrator : In Kansas, a homeowner is attacked by an invisible force with a taste for blood. 
 I had never been on a case where there was so much activity going on simultaneously. 
 What's going on?! leave me alone! 
 Narrator : In the great lakes, a teenager is targeted by a violent entity. 
 Is it a human spirit or something much worse? 
 This is now not just a regular malevolent haunting. 
 This is something bigger. 
 Narrator : And in Massachusetts, a troubled spirit reveals a shocking family tragedy that's been hidden for centuries. 
 "Did you have a daughter?" indication was yes. 
 Narrator : On a quiet street in Atchison, Kansas, stands the home of tony and Debra Pickman. 
 But their lives are anything but peaceful. 
 Since they moved in, troubling events have beset the family. 
 At first, it's small things. 
 Pictures are turned upside down on the walls. 
 Objects get mysteriously moved when backs are turned. 
 Tony begins to have vivid recurring dreams. 
 A girl who calls herself Sallie tries to pull him out of bed. 
 In the morning, tony notices he has burn marks where Sallie had grabbed his arm. 
 When tony mentions the dreams to his neighbors, he is shocked to learn that a child of the house's previous occupants had an imaginary friend named Sallie. 
 Then the activity plaguing tony escalates into something more violent. 
 Joe : It was tony that was experiencing this stuff, things that were happening to him physically. 
 Scratch marks on his arm, his back. 
 Bruises would appear. 
 He would have burning sensations on his thigh. 
 He got pushed back by a force that just knocked him back. 
 Tony?! what's going on?! 
 Leave me alone! 
 He felt enraged inside. 
 He thought he was gonna do harm to his wife. 
 Narrator : Confused and terrified, the Pickmans call several paranormal investigators. 
 Joe : They had various groups come in and try to help them. 
 Nothing seemed to be working, no matter who came in. 
 Narrator : Increasingly desperate, in 2007, they contact an investigator from Rhode Island. 
 Joe Cetrone has been actively hunting ghosts for over 15 years. 
 As a child, Joe had a terrifying encounter with a spirit. 
 And he's been on a quest to find the truth about the supernatural ever since. 
 What I've learned is to never underestimate the power of what you cannot see. 
 Narrator : Joe is moved by Tony Pickman's experience. 
 I'm listening to them talk. 
 I can hear the pain in his voice as he's telling us the story. 
 And his wife was telling us. 
 And I just felt like, "you know what?" 
 "I wanna help these people." 
 Narrator : Joe flies to Kansas with colleague Steve pate to begin an investigation. 
 But when they arrive, Joe gets an unexpected feeling. 
 Joe : I'm like, "this is it?" I mean, it seems warm and cozy. 
 I'm like, "how could there be any activity there at all?" 
 Narrator : Tony and Debra show Joe pictures from previous investigators. 
 Joe : We're looking at some of the early evidence. 
 And, you know, I don't see anything definitive of anything evil in the pictures. 
 Whatever is in here can't be anything harmful. 
 Narrator : Then the mood changes dramatically. 
 We started smelling lilacs. 
 It is believed that because we can't physically see spirits that sometimes when their presence is around then they can smell that cigar smoke or a certain perfume -- 
 Something to signify that particular spirit. 
 But for us, it was lilacs. 
 And tony lifted up his shirt. 
 He says, "is there anything under my back?" 
 And I'm looking at it. 
 And it's a fresh scratch mark with -- 
 With blood dripping. 
 And I'm just sitting there shocked. 
 I'm like, "did this just happen?" 
 Steve : For tony to actually physically be scratched, there was definitely something evil going on in the Sallie house. 
 Joe : Could there be some conflicting battle going on between spirits and tony? 
 I wasn't sure, but, obviously, at that point, I wanted to find out. 
 Narrator : Joe and Steve begin the investigation in the master bedroom, scene of Tony's first encounter with a spirit named Sallie. 
 Joe : It would be warm. 
 And then I would take a step further, and all of a sudden, it would just... 
 It would just change. 
 I mean, it would get cold -- really cold. 
 And I'd step back. 
 And it was warm temperature again. 
 We had my digital thermometer. 
 And originally, it was like 67. 
 But where that cold spot was, it was about 45. 
 And we felt it. 
 That's an indicator that there's something paranormal there, an energy that is draining the energy in that house, which drops that temperature down. 
 I had the chills. 
 They're just letting us know that they're there. 
 Narrator : When Joe asks if there's any other areas of paranormal activity in the house, they lead him to an area previous investigators have called the vortex. 
 Joe : It would have activity -- 
 A portal, um, a supernatural bus stop where spirits can come to and fro. 
 Steve : A portal, to me, is a hole to another world -- 
 Maybe something in the past, something in the future or alternate universe. 
 Joe : And out of nowhere, I started capturing... 
 (Camera shutter clicking) 
 ...Orbs. 
 An orb is a -- a ball of energy. 
 And a spirit orb is the energy of that spirit. 
 What was unusual about it is as I zoomed in, it looked like a face inside that orb -- 
 Something I had not experienced before. 
 Steve : I've seen hundreds of orbs and never seen one with a face before. 
 This particular one... 
 And the face was shaped like a skull. 
 You could actually see the sockets where the eyes were and the shape and the mouth. 
 Narrator : While Joe tries to make sense of the evidence... 
 Aah! 
 ...Tony yells out in pain. 
 He was being targeted, it felt. 
 Joe : Tony had a fresh wound. Blood was coming down. 
 And, I mean, when you go through this and you can see it happen and you know it is, it's still hard to believe that it's happening. 
 When you're investigating the paranormal and you sense any kind of evil, it's scary. 
 It's terrifying. 
 Joe : At that point, I'm like, "okay, guys, let's get tony out of here." 
 Narrator : Concerned for everyone's safety, Joe calls a halt to the investigation. 
 Joe : To come up with evidence is one thing. 
 But to see somebody get physically harmed, that's another thing. 
 I was like, "you know what? 
 We've gotta close it up." So we left. 
 We went to the hotel. 
 Narrator : But the ghostly encounters are not over just yet. 
 Joe : When we went back to the hotel, I was still shocked that he was attacked. 
 I mean, obviously, seeing those scratch marks on his forehead and on his back and the orbs with the faces, it was overwhelming. 
 When I got out of the shower... 
 (Knock on door) 
 ...Hung the towel on the chair... The other investigator comes in. 
 And we're talking about what happened. 
 The towel that was on the chair lifted up and fell to the ground. 
 There was something there following us. 
 I had never been on a case where there was so much activity going on simultaneously. 
 Narrator : The next night, Joe and Steve return to the Pickmans'. 
 "Behold"... Steve reads from the bible for extra protection. 
 "Because thou hast made thy"... 
 It'll never hurt to open up a bible. 
 Of course, that's my beliefs, growing up catholic. 
 But as far as that gonna help, I have no idea. 
 Narrator : They cautiously head into the basement. 
 We're proceeding, going around in that area. 
 Tony : Ouch! aah! 
 All of a sudden, I hear Tony's been attacked again. 
 Narrator : Homeowner Tony Pickman is being relentlessly attacked by an evil spirit. 
 And paranormal investigator Joe Cetrone seems powerless to help. 
 All of a sudden, Tony's been attacked again. 
 And there's his blood dripping. 
 And I noticed he'd been scratched on the arm. 
 It was definitely demonic in nature. 
 Steve : When demonic spirits attack, they're trying to possess someone's body so they can be human. 
 When something that dark has a hold on a place, it's hard to get rid of. 
 Narrator : Despite not knowing the true identity of the demonic spirit, Joe knows he cannot risk tony getting hurt again. 
 He decides to cleanse the house immediately. 
 Joe : We had a game plan. 
 Went through each room and prayed. 
 We anointed the windows with holy oil. 
 Whatever was in there, we wanted it out. 
 We wanted it away from this house and away from Deb and Tony. 
 "Fortress... " 
 Narrator : In the basement, they're met with a malevolent atmosphere. 
 There was something down there that didn't want us there. 
 "Thou shalt not be afraid for the terror by night"... 
 It was a presence of evil. 
 Narrator : In the face of the demon, Joe and Steve must summon all their courage to continue the cleanse. 
 Joe : As we prayed, I could feel that atmosphere kinda change and break. 
 "A thousand shall fall by thy side"... 
 And that eeriness was -- was lifting. 
 We all felt it. 
 We all looked at each other and said, "it's gone." 
 Truthfully, I don't think it was a human spirit at all. 
 I think it was a spirit that could shift any identity it wanted. 
 Scariest part of the investigation was watching tony. 
 It attacked, and I have no explanation as to why. 
 The Sallie house had such an impact on Joe. 
 He doesn't even like to talk about it. 
 Joe : The Sallie house, for me, is the most intense case that I've done because it made me realize that it's not just about getting your evidence and walking through houses with your cameras. 
 It made me realize that the most important part of investigation, especially when you're dealing with something dark, is the safety of the family and the people you're trying to help, not the evidence you're trying to gain. 
 For me, it's probably the top case that I've ever done. 
 (Thunder crashes) 
 Narrator : Coming up, when called to a haunted historic house, one investigator runs into a troubled spirit desperate to reveal a shocking family secret that's been hidden for centuries. 
 This individual wants to communicate something. 
 And they have people who are now listening to them. 
 Narrator : But first, a teenage girl is attacked by an entity that is not what it first appears to be. 
 Woman : Ted, what's the matter? 
 Narrator : In Elora, a small town in rural Ontario, an ordinary house stands on an ordinary street. 
 But what is happening inside is far from ordinary. 
 In march 2006, the frank family starts to hear angry growling coming from the walls. 
 Doors slam closed with no explanation. 
 And heavy footsteps pace the hallways when no one else is at home. 
 Soon, the activity takes a frightening turn. 
 The family's 14-year-old daughter, Alice, is held down and choked by something in her sleep. 
 But it's not just once. 
 Alice is attacked night after night. 
 (Gasps) 
 Something is pushing down on her chest at night, holding her down in her bed. 
 So she is feeling terrorized, and she's nauseous as she tries to close her eyes to get it to stop. 
 Narrator : Terrified and desperate, the family contacts a paranormal investigator. 
 Michelle Desrochers is the founder of Canada’s most haunted paranormal research group. 
 A veteran of over 50 investigations, many involving child victims, Michelle always acts quickly because the young are so vulnerable. 
 When I get e-mails that pertain to children, it always becomes prioritized because things, if you don't catch them on time, can escalate a lot more serious. 
 (Gasps, panting) 
 Michelle : I mean, I'm thinking to myself, "what's gonna happen to this girl if I don't nip this right off?" 
 (Whimpering) 
 There's something going on here. 
 I need to know what it is. I need to know why. 
 I need to make it stop. 
 Narrator : Michelle drops everything to investigate before it's too late. 
 Michelle : For this investigation, I asked my colleague Patrick to join me. 
 And I asked one of our psychic mediums to come along, as well. 
 I had not been in the house a minute, and all of a sudden, I am in this cold spot. 
 That in itself is a little bit unusual. 
 I was actually sitting here like this. 
 Like, I was freezing. 
 Patrick : I was really cold. 
 And there was a furnace going. 
 But it was extremely, temperature-wise, still freezing cold. 
 Freezing cold is always a sense of something moving around. 
 Or it could be a ghost activity. 
 Probably about 10 minutes in, the medium picks up that there's something behind me. 
 I feel a cold spot again. 
 And it felt very malevolent. 
 And at that point, our medium said, "oh, there's a spirit named Edith here. 
 And she's an older woman. 
 And this was her house." 
 Narrator : Homeowner Rachel frank is stunned. 
 Edith is her mother. 
 And she's been dead for months. 
 Narrator : A 14-year-old girl is being violently attacked in her sleep by a vicious entity. 
 Her parents have called in ghost hunter Michelle Desrochers and her team. 
 And almost as soon as they step inside, they make a chilling discovery. 
 There's a spirit named Edith here. 
 And she's an older woman. 
 And this was her house. 
 Narrator : Edith is the name of the homeowner's recently deceased grandmother. 
 With horror, the family realize that the paranormal activity began soon after she passed away. 
 I couldn't understand why a spirit woman who seemed to be gentle enough would all of a sudden direct anger at one member of the family. 
 That piqued my curiosity. 
 Narrator : Michelle asks to be shown the grandmother's old room. 
 This is a bad place. 
 The mother was talking about, "it was cold all the time." 
 The rocking chair would move by itself. 
 And just yelling and different things going on. 
 My mother died in this room. 
 Michelle : Ted? are you all right? 
 Medium just looked at me and goes, "this is not a nice lady." 
 I said to the medium, "ask her if she is the one holding down her granddaughter." 
 (Sighs) 
 She's the one. 
 Narrator : But Michelle is not convinced. 
 Her experience and intuition are telling her that something more sinister is going on. 
 Grandma does not feel like the most prominent energy in this room. 
 I knew that we were dealing with something that was a lot worse. 
 I could smell a bit of sulfur. 
 And I just got really bad smells, sulfuric smells. 
 Narrator : This couldn't be worse news. 
 Sulfur is a sign of a demonic presence. 
 Is this thing overpowering the spirit of grandma? 
 You know, they are known to hold spirits hostage. 
 This is now not just a regular malevolent haunting. 
 This is something bigger. 
 Narrator : Investigator Patrick Cross notices something else troubling in the room. 
 There's mirrors everywhere, so the mirrors were facing one another and facing across from the top of the bed. 
 So we believe that there was a vortex being created by the mirrors. 
 Michelle : It's believed that when two mirrors face one another, they could create a portal. 
 Which means we have a revolving door on the upper level of this house that things can just come in and out of. 
 Patrick : The mother said she saw lights coming from the mirrors. 
 She said it also growled and made animal sounds. 
 So that's why when we looked at 'em, they said, "we knew there was a vortex from there." 
 We need to take it down. 
 Narrator : But when they try to close the vortex by removing a mirror, the entity attacks. 
 Michelle : All of a sudden, the psychic put his hand to his eye and said, "I just got poked in the eye." 
 Patrick : Looked at him, and his eye was very red, completely red. 
 We didn't know what happened. He said he got poked in the eye. 
 
 
 
 (Groaning) 
 This just got real. 
 Narrator : For Michelle, the attack seems to confirm her worst fear -- 
 That the grandmother has been taken over by a violent demonic entity. 
 Michelle decides the only safe course of action is to cleanse the house immediately. 
 Michelle : There's a very malevolent energy in this room. 
 We want it out. That simple. 
 We were going to smudge the room. 
 Patrick : It's made of natural herbs. 
 It's off the land. And it's blessed. 
 Anything evil or anything ghostly just doesn't like it. 
 Michelle : We spent a lot of time smudging over the bed because this is where her spirit left the body. 
 That is a very powerful release of energy. 
 The theory, of course, is to just make it so uncomfortable for the spirit that the air is just so thick with the stuff that they're just gonna vacate the room. 
 Narrator : The smudging complete, the team heads downstairs. 
 But the activity isn't over yet. 
 Michelle : All of a sudden, we hear... 
 It sounded like a door slamming. 
 Patrick : There was nobody up there at the time 'cause all the family was downstairs. 
 The doors were slamming in the grandmother's room. 
 Michelle : I jumped out of my chair, ran upstairs. 
 No doors were closed. 
 We left everything open. 
 We sat there for about 15 minutes. 
 Did not hear a sound after that. 
 Yes! 
 I hope this means that whatever it is that was up here has just vacated the premises. 
 I hope that this problem is solved. 
 Yes! 
 We left that house feeling confident that night that it was quiet, that the family would be okay. 
 Narrator : For a few months, life for the family goes back to normal. 
 Then Michelle gets a chilling call from homeowner Rachel frank. 
 Michelle : Her concern was that her daughter is starting to exhibit signs -- 
 Let's just say a darker personality. 
 She goes, "this is not my little girl." 
 She said, "I think it's starting again. 
 Can you come back?" 
 In my experience in investigating, this is never good. 
 This is something trying to come in and trying to take over -- again. 
 Patrick and I decided we would go back to the house together. 
 And we really weren't sure what to expect this time around. 
 Narrator : To Michelle’s horror, they're greeted by an overpowering stench. 
 I walked over to the bed, and I'm smelling sulfur. 
 Narrator : It can only mean one thing. 
 The demon is back -- and stronger than before. 
 Narrator : A violent, negative entity has been terrorizing a teenage girl. 
 Ghost hunter Michelle Desrochers thought she had removed it from the house. 
 I hope that this problem is solved. 
 Narrator : But the demon has returned -- stronger than before. 
 I'm smelling sulfur. 
 At this point, my concern was I wanted to talk to the daughter. 
 I said, "is there something troubling you? 
 Are you being held down at night again?" 
 Narrator : Alice's answer is alarming. 
 And she said, "oh, yes." 
 It was a demon in this house trying to possess this girl. 
 Is it dangerous? absolutely. 
 He had her in his grip. 
 I had to break the grip. 
 Narrator : But to cast out the demon once and for all, Michelle and her team have to be able to communicate with it. 
 So Michelle devises a simple test using a glass of water. 
 I put the glass on the table. 
 And I'm talking to the being. 
 So I said, "I am putting this out there. 
 I want to communicate with the entity that is trying to control this girl. 
 Please come forth." 
 The glass starts to move. 
 Like, just like that, the glass was moving around by itself. 
 Michelle : I just called it out. I said, "I want you out. 
 I want you gone. This is finished." 
 Narrator : Now the cleanse can begin. 
 Michelle asks Alice to take the lead so that she might remove all traces of her demonic possession. 
 I wanted to be sure that<i> she</i> would be the one to cast this thing away. 
 I felt her get mad. 
 You know, "don't ever come back here. 
 We're done. I want you gone. I want you out." 
 We want them to fight back. 
 We don't want them to be victims. 
 I want you to go! 
 We're not gonna let the spirit win. 
 We smudged the entire upstairs, starting with the hallway -- 
 So thick with smoke, it could choke a horse. 
 We just saturated it. 
 I wanna make sure this is, like, foolproof. 
 Narrator : The plan works. 
 The heaviness of the house lifts. 
 And Alice starts to become herself once more. 
 Michelle : And the mother looked at me and she said, "thank god for you. 
 You've given us back our lives." 
 The frightening part of this investigation for me was the fact that it made me realize how vulnerable we actually are -- 
 Just how strong these things are and how easily we can be manipulated without even realizing it. 
 And when we finally do realize it, they're so -- 
 They've latched on so hard that... 
 How do we get out of something we didn't even know was happening? 
 Narrator : Usually, paranormal investigators are called into a haunted building to help the owners understand what's going on. 
 But in this next case, it's the ghost that needs the investigators' help the most. 
 In the historic Boston suburb of Jamaica plain stands a mansion built in 1760 by commodore Joshua Loring, a wealthy British naval officer. 
 Now run by a preservation society, the mansion is plagued by mysterious paranormal activity. 
 (Footsteps approaching) 
 Visitors and staff report footsteps echoing along empty hallways. 
 Muffled voices are heard when no one else is in the building. 
 And many witnesses tell of the unnerving feeling that they are being watched. 
 Jack : The preservation society informed us of different activity within the home that had been experienced -- 
 Hearing voices, feelings of, like, "you shouldn't be in this area" 
 Reported in the basement area. 
 Narrator : The preservation society calls Jack Kenna and his team to investigate. 
 One of New England’s most respected ghost hunters, jack is analytical in his approach, thanks to his 30-year career as an engineer with the U.S. Department of defence. 
 But that doesn't mean he is without emotion. 
 The one thing that frightens me about investigating the paranormal is you never know what type of spirit you're communicating with. 
 Narrator : Jack has been part of dozens of investigations. 
 But this one is special. 
 Jack : It's a mansion. 
 So it gives its own presence, its own, like, "I need to be respected." 
 It's also very exciting because we are the very first paranormal team to be allowed into the home to investigate it. 
 Narrator : Jack and his team arrange to spend a night inside. 
 What the team was hoping to accomplish with the investigation was just find out, is there any activity within the home? 
 Or are there other, more natural reasons for those experiences? 
 Narrator : On the team is seasoned investigator Sharon Koogler. 
 If it looks like there's actually something going on, then we do try to figure out what it is exactly. 
 Narrator : The team splits up to cover more ground. 
 Sharon heads to the kitchen, while jack ventures into the basement alone. 
 Jack : Stepping into the basement, I had an intense feeling of being watched. 
 I did get a feeling of "I shouldn't be down there." 
 It was a very strong feeling. 
 Narrator : Refusing to be intimidated, jack starts searching for entities using his ghost radar device. 
 Ghost radar is an application that can be used on a cellphone or a tablet. 
 It gives you the ability, as an investigator, to ask a question and potentially get an immediate response through a word that you can hear. 
 So they are electronic voice phenomena. 
 But you will actually hear them at the time they're spoken. 
 Narrator : Ghost radar uses the device's motion, Wi-Fi and GPS sensors to detect fluctuations that could indicate paranormal activity. 
 It can also show you just energy blips on it that may be spirit energy. 
 And you can see little blips of energy. 
 There's blue for low energy, yellow and green for medium energy and red for high energy. 
 Narrator : Suddenly, something appears on the ghost radar. 
 Jack is not alone. 
 Narrator : In a haunted Boston, Massachusetts, mansion, ghost hunter Jack Kenna ventures into the basement, leaving his team upstairs. 
 Did get a feeling of "I shouldn't be down there." 
 Narrator : But he is not alone. 
 Using his ghost radar device, jack attempts to communicate with whatever entity is down there. 
 Was that you? 
 I began to ask questions. 
 "Who's here with me?" 
 The ghost radar speaks the word "colony." 
 Narrator : Jack suspects the response refers to the fact that America was still a British colony when the mansion was built. 
 Could he be speaking to the centuries-old spirit of one of the Loring family? 
 All right, I just felt you. 
 Okay. It's okay. 
 So we got the name Joseph, a male voice saying, "Joseph." 
 And there was a Joseph Loring in -- 
 Of the original family who owned the home. 
 All right. 
 Narrator : Whoever the spirit is, it's not content with just talking. 
 That's when I felt a hand on my shoulder, something touch my shoulder, actually became afraid. 
 I went back up the stairs, turned the light on. 
 Little bit freaky. 
 Wasn't expecting it, especially that quickly into an investigation. 
 'Cause it takes a lot of energy for them to do things like that, especially touching you. 
 Narrator : After taking a few minutes to regain his composure, jack heads back into the basement. 
 Jack : I shut the light back off. 
 Narrator : It's not long before the ghost radar has another message. 
 Jack : Can you make the other device? 
 And then the ghost radar speaks, "shoulder," 
 Which I had just been touched on the shoulder. 
 And I'm alone there by myself. 
 You know there's something down there with you at this point. 
 You don't know what it is or what its intent is. 
 I've been touched. 
 I'm having these feelings of anxiety, a little bit afraid. 
 I don't wanna be in the creepy basement by myself. 
 I just wanna get out of there. 
 Narrator : Meanwhile, upstairs, Sharon’s team is encountering activity of their own. 
 We thought we heard footsteps, like, out in the hallway. 
 We wandered down the hall, didn't hear it after that. 
 So hard to tell if it was actual footsteps. 
 Narrator : In the kitchen, Sharon begins an electronic voice phenomena, or EVP, session to record the sounds of any ghosts present. 
 Sharon : Come on. 
 Then just as they're getting ready to leave, they capture a voice. 
 It's an EVP of a woman's voice saying, "I'm coming with you." 
 Woman : I'm coming with you. 
 I'm coming with you. 
 You know, that's pretty intense. 
 Definitely, there's something intelligent in there. 
 Narrator : The EVP session is brought to an end when jack calls them upstairs to join him in the master bedroom. 
 Jack : We're all gathered around this table in the center of the room, where I've got the k-ii device set up. 
 I've got the ghost radar device set up. 
 And I've got the camera set up. 
 And at that point, there's an EVP captured saying, "I'm back with you." 
 Female voice saying, "I'm back with you." 
 Narrator : Jack believes the spirit Sharon encountered in the kitchen has followed them. 
 And he wants to know who this spirit is. 
 Jack : So I started asking questions -- "are you the Loring family?" 
 K-II flashes for that. 
 So I'm like, "okay. So you're the Loring family?" 
 Are you Commodore Loring's wife? 
 Yes or no? 
 Are you one of his daughters? 
 Yes. 
 Flashes again. 
 And it responds "yes." 
 But it's a very quiet response. 
 And what I'm feeling is that this individual wants to communicate something. 
 They're very intense about getting this story out, whatever the story is. 
 We know it could be, maybe, embarrassing, what you're -- we're talking about. 
 But if you need it to be known, yes, you do. 
 I started getting a feeling of embarrassment, like maybe something happened that shouldn't have happened. 
 "Does it have something to do with a child?" 
 And the response to that is "yes." 
 And I don't know why I'm starting to get these thoughts that maybe something happened here that wasn't good. 
 Narrator : But nothing could prepare jack for what the spirit would reveal next. 
 Narrator : While investigating a historic Massachusetts mansion, investigator Jack Kenna has encountered something dark in the basement. 
 Then the spirit of the daughter of the mansion's original owner makes herself known. 
 And jack believes she has a secret to tell. 
 Jack : And I don't know why I'm starting to get these thoughts that maybe something happened here that wasn't good. 
 I said, did you have a child?" 
 Response is "yes." 
 So, do you wanna talk about it? 
 I asked the question, you know, "were you raped?" 
 Is that what I'm understanding? 
 Response was very quiet again. 
 But there was an indication that "yes." 
 Sharon : You know, to have something like that come up, that's -- yeah. 
 That's pretty intense. 
 So I think everybody was shocked and just like, "wow." 
 Narrator : Jack continues to probe, hoping the answers will put the spirit to rest and end the paranormal activity in the mansion. 
 Jack : "Did you have a daughter?" indication was "yes." 
 You wanna talk about your daughter, what happened to her? 
 Narrator : The spirit has more shocking revelations. 
 "Was she killed?" response seemed to be "yes." 
 Did your father get rid of her? 
 Yes. 
 Two pretty profound experiences going on. 
 We've got Hannah, on one hand, who describes being raped, having a child. 
 And that child is gone. 
 On the other hand, I've got the experience in the basement with being touched on the shoulder, capturing the name "Joseph" on an EVP, which is a male spirit. 
 Narrator : Jack can't be sure that the spirit haunting the basement is connected with Hannah’s tragic story. 
 Jack : What do I really believe? 
 That Hannah was raped by one of her family members. 
 This was what she indicated. It's what she said. 
 But this shouldn't happen to anybody. 
 Nobody should have to go through this. 
 Narrator : Feeling emotionally involved in Hannah’s story, jack searches the family archives to prove his theory. 
 So now I wanna really dig into the history. 
 Can I find out if this is actually true? 
 Narrator : The records seem to confirm jack's evidence. 
 We do find out that there was a daughter, Mary, born into the Loring family. 
 And she's the only child in the Loring family there's no further information on. 
 At the time, Hannah would've been between the ages of 17 to 18 when this Mary was born. 
 The family was a very prominent family. 
 They wouldn't want anything known about this. 
 And they would wanna get rid of the child. 
 That daughter was taken away. 
 And she never saw her daughter again. 
 The fact that there's only one record, even, that mentions this daughter, Mary. 
 It's like she was wiped from the family records completely. 
 But Hannah needed to get that out. 
 She needed to have that story told because it was her daughter. 
 Narrator : Jack tries to put Hannah’s mind at ease by telling her story to the mansion's preservation society. 
 They decide to let the spirits stay. 
 Jack : To tell that story for her had extremely special meaning for me. 
 It's unlike any investigation we've done. 
 Usually, we're trying to help a<i> human</i> client. 
 In this particular case, we're trying to help the spirit. 
 It's just heartbreaking, in some senses, with regards to her story. 
 But it is an incredible experience. 
 And it is an honor, as well.
