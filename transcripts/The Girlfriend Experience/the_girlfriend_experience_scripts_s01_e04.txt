 Are you on the pill? 
 Yes... But I'd like to use a condom. 
 (PASSIONATE BREATHING) 
 You got lazy and lost XHP. 
 Let me fix this. 
 How? 
 Trust me. 
 This is how things move. 
 Don't lecture me on how things move! 
 We're doing everything we can! 
 (CRASHING RECEIVER) 
 What were you gonna do? 
 I don't wanna bring you into this. 
 Do you come to town often or...? 
 No, not very often. 
 Although that could change. 
 Why is that? 
 Because of you. 
 (SOUNDS OF GETTING OUT OF BED) 
 Did you cum? 
 Sorry. 
 Are you okay? 
 Well... 
 What's going on? 
 Here, come sit down. 
 (SOUND OF PATTING) 
 I make... okay money, but... probably not as much as your other clients. 
 I'm having a hard time to come up with money to see you. 
 I've started to taking out loans... 
 I'm sorry. 
 I don't mean to make you uncomfortable, but it would tear me up if I could not see you again. 
 Okay... um, why don't we maybe try seeing each other a little bit less? 
 Can you lower... your rate a little bit? 
 I'm in love with you. 
 Kevin... 
 You're putting me in a very uncomfortable position. 
 I know. 
 I'm sorry. 
 Um... 
 What if I take some time and figure out some kind of, um, an arrangement that... works for both of us, and- and keeps us together? 
 Really? 
 Thank you. 
 Oh, thank you. 
 You are amazing. 
 You're amazing. 
 (SOUND OF KNOCKING ON DOOR) 
 (LOCK CLICKS) 
 Hi! 
 Hi. 
 How you doing, teeny? 
 Good. 
 Yeah? 
 How was your trip? 
 It was good. 
 I just got off the phone with Mom. 
 She gave me this massive guilt trip about getting to see you. 
 She can come visit. 
 Yeah, I know, but maybe you can call her? 
 I call her all the time. 
 I don't believe you. You're being too defensive. 
 sh1t, I smell. 
 ...And then we broke into groups and we talked about our fears and our goals... 
 And then you fell into each other's arms, and did trust exercises with all the DAs. 
 Okay, well we didn't do- we didn't do that, we didn't fall into each other's arms. 
 But you did trust exercises? 
 Yes! 
 It- you're making it sound way cheesier than it actually is. 
 It's very good for communication in my department. - Is this the same, um, retreat the DAs went on last year where they went zip-lining? 
 No, it's not. 
 But that was also very fun, and very helpful for us. 
 Right, I can see how that's helpful. 
 You realize your guys' job is to put people in prison? 
 Yeah, our job is to put bad people in prison. 
 Yeah, I remember feeling like it was a formality at a certain point. 
 Yeah, I'm definitely learning more in the firm than in class or studying. 
 I know, you'll get there. 
 I know. 
 I know you know. You're so defensive. 
 So, are you still dating Jake? 
 I was never dating Jake. 
 Of course you were dating Jake. 
 I wasn't saying that he was your boyfriend. 
 I just found him to be too available. 
 I just don't enjoy spending time with people, I find it to be... a waste of time, and it makes me anxious. 
 (LAUGHS) 
 Well, maybe you just didn't like Jake. 
 No, I just don't like sharing my time with anyone unless something's being accomplished. 
 You're really selfish. 
 Hey, you're fine. 
 Thanks. 
 No wait, I'm- I'm sorry, I understand, I- I get it... 
 You value your time. 
 Exactly. 
 Well, speaking of, uh, I was going to stay the weekend. 
 Um, I don't know what you have planned, um, but I'd love to hang out with you. 
 It's okay. 
 I know I just sprung that on you. 
 I'm just slammed. I wouldn't even be around but... 
 Yeah, that's fine, it's fine. 
 Seriously, I- I understand how second-year law is. 
 You don't have to explain it to me. 
 No, I got it. 
 You sure? 
 I got it, yeah. 
 Who else am I going to spend my massive salary on? 
 No, I'm listening to you. 
 Yeah... 
 No, I'm happy for you, no- 
 She hung up. 
 Can you believe it? She hung up on me. 
 Maybe the phone lost reception. 
 No, she wants to do another real estate venture. 
 How many has she done already? 
 You know, well... 
 This time it's condos in San Diego. 
 I don't know what to say. 
 ...We don't talk anymore. I never talk to her. 
 The only time I talk to her is when she wants money. 
 It's all my fault. 
 'Cause I shoulda... 
 I shoulda established no! 
 I shoulda told her no. 
 What's no? 
 I bet you were a handful for your daddy. 
 Still are probably. 
 No... 
 Huh? 
 No, we, we get along really well. 
 I miss you. 
 I miss you, too. 
 What I should do is I should just stay here with you. 
 I'd love that. 
 Well, I'd be happy. 
 (SOUND OF FRONT DOOR OPENING) 
 ♪ (PARTY MUSIC FLOATING THROUGH HOUSE) 
 ...Really? 
 You have to do it to her... 
 Hey. 
 Get them to sign on the line which is dotted. 
 It's a given... 
 I know he's stalling, but it's gonna be a given. 
 Get them to sign... 
 ...on the line- - ...on the line which is dotted. 
 Holy sh1t! 
 Speak of the devil. 
 Excuse me. 
 (SOUND OF DOOR CLOSING SOFTLY) 
 Ohhhh... 
 (SOUND OF POURING WINE) 
 Hey. 
 Oh, hi... 
 I got this for you. 
 That was very thoughtful, Christine. 
 Not really. 
 Just opened it. 
 C'mon, drink up. That's what we're here for. 
 I didn't expect to see you. 
 I thought it'd be good idea to show my face, you know... 
 Clear the water. 
 Did you two come together? 
 Ahhh... 
 You're Wright... 
 Emery Wright, you rep XHP. 
 I'm David's intern, it's my job to know. 
 Oh okay, well, I'm flattered that you noticed. 
 There's my wife. Excuse me. 
 Hey. 
 Hi... 
 I'm so glad you came. 
 I have uh, two hours before I pick the boys up from soccer. 
 Okay. 
 Susan! 
 Megan! Hey! 
 Susan! 
 Hi, how are you? 
 Great, how are you? 
 I am well. 
 Really? Good to see you. 
 Good to see you, too. 
 Okay, shove off, give me my wife back. 
 Bye. 
 Can't somebody else pick them up? 
 I mean these are your friends, too. 
 Don't do that. 
 Do what? 
 Don't pretend that this party has anything to do with me. 
 This is about you. I showed up, okay? 
 Okay. 
 Sign it! 
 You gotta sign on the line... 
 I know. I know. 
 Just kidding, just kidding. 
 Yo, Tariq, maybe get you a cab. 
 Yeah, let me grab you a water. 
 You'll thank me in the morning. 
 Just pretend that you are talking to me for a minute. 
 Okay. 
 I'm talking to you. 
 I'm avoiding drunk Tariq. 
 Thanks for the honesty. 
 I'm always honest. 
 Always? 
 Never. 
 You? 
 Sometimes. 
 I can get you a ziplock bag, if you need one. 
 I've got one right in the kitchen. 
 I'm good. 
 Do I look that desperate? 
 Honestly... Yes. 
 But you said you're never honest. 
 I am when it matters. 
 I'll hold you to that. 
 Okay. 
 
 
 
 (SOUNDS OF BUSY DOWNTOWN, TAXI COMING TO STOP) 
 Take him golfing, get him a nice cigar. 
 Right, because he's- when he said- 
 When he says it in that room... 
 It's not that he doesn't mean it, it's that he's not committing to it. 
 There's a big difference. 
 So, are you seeing anyone else? 
 Like outside of work? 
 Like a real boyfriend? 
 No. 
 I've actually never really had a "real boyfriend". 
 Why not? 
 Well I dunno, I guess as soon as I sort of realized there was such a thing as me and other people, I kind of... 
 I guess I just- I don't... have the same, you know, reactions to things or... feelings about the way things are supposed to be. 
 Does that make any sense at all? 
 It makes total sense. 
 You're like a female Ted Bundy. 
 Oh, my god! 
 Okay, I shoulda made something up. 
 Yeah, like always. 
 Really? 
 (PHONE RINGING) 
 Do I make you feel like I lie to you? 
 I'm f*cking with you. 
 Hold on. 
 Better yet, I'm f*cking you. 
 It's a whole lot more fun... Yes? 
 What? 
 You gotta be kidding me! 
 No, no, I just came from that meeting! 
 It's only been two hours, but I'll pay you for the four. 
 Gotta go. 
 (PASSIONATE FEMALE SIGHING) 
 Be careful. 
 Oh, what's the matter? 
 Slower. 
 Slow... 
 Okay. 
 That's good? 
 Yeah, yeah. 
 (WHISPERS) Why don't you lie down. 
 (EROTIC BREATHING) 
 But I think most people, especially guys... 
 Most of them... 
 What is it called? 
 You don't know what it is? 
 It's a fungus. 
 Hmm. 
 It sounds horrible. 
 It even looks worse. 
 So that's why I got my socks on. 
 That's fine. 
 You can keep your socks on anytime. 
 (CELL PHONE BUZZING) 
 (CELL PHONE BUZZING AGAIN) 
 (CELL PHONE BUZZING AGAIN) 
 (CELL PHONE CONTINUES TO BUZZ) 
 (CELL PHONE STOPS BUZZING) 
 I'm gonna go. 
 I told you it was a given. 
 Yeah. 
 Probably just needs to throw a tantrum here and there. 
 He's signing, but he wants Erin to head it. 
 Wait a minute. 
 I spoke to Wright this morning. He didn't say anything about Erin. 
 You're not listening. 
 He is staying with us, but only if Erin takes over. 
 You'll still work on the case. 
 I'm sorry. 
 Have you been fed and watered? 
 I've been taken care of. Thanks, Tariq. 
 Good. 
 There he is. 
 David. 
 I'm glad it worked out. 
 It worked out just fine. 
 You waiting for Zucker? 
 No, he's been detained. 
 Glad you guys could make it. 
 Mmm-hmm. 
 He just needed a little reassurance to stay with us. 
 Erin, I'm surprised with your humility. 
 I'm kidding, you're gonna love her. 
 Well, she is very persuasive. 
 He's with Kirkland, that's all that matters. 
 You went behind my back. 
 I saw an opportunity, and I took it. 
 There wasn't a chance to tell you sooner. 
 Well, now is not the time. 
 (SOUND OF DOOR SLAMMING) 
 Could you give that to David when you're done? 
 (KNOCKING ON DOOR) 
 Yeah. 
 Susan wanted me to give you these. 
 Hmmm... 
 Also I was wondering if you've had a chance yet to review the Colson affidavits. 
 No. 
 Okay... 
 Um, let me know when you do. 
 I'll look them over in the morning. 
 Great. 
 It's been a long day. 
 I hear you. 
 How you liking it here? 
 Yeah, it's great. 
 Want to get a beer? 
 Right now? 
 Yeah. 
 You tell me your goals. 
 You poach... 
 You do. 
 You're working on a case, you consider him your client, it doesn't matter who's heading it. 
 Seriously. 
 They're yours to be had. 
 I am not saying be- be desperate and tactless but... 
 But you're saying once I pass the Bar, your clients are my clients... 
 If you can out-charm me... 
 Sure. 
 Done. 
 You're definitely prettier. 
 Speaking of poaching, I heard that Erin's heading the XHP case now. 
 How did you hear that? 
 I thought everybody knew that. 
 I'm still heading it. 
 Wright's just making a statement. 
 Just trying to align myself with the right person. 
 Wow... 
 Well, I can see you don't need any lessons in office politics. 
 You better watch out for me. 
 I can see that. 
 You should focus on becoming a good lawyer first. 
 (SOUND OF CHRISTINE GIGGLING) 
 Is "should" the key word there? 
 "Should" is always the key word. 
 As in, should we get another drink or...? 
 You want a beer? 
 Sure. 
 I bought this place... for late nights at the office. 
 It's been getting a lot of use lately... 
 Since Megan and I are having problems. 
 (WHISPERS) So... 
 (SOUND OF BEER BOTTLE ON COUNTER) 
 ♪ (THEME MUSIC COMES UP) 
 (SOUND OF PANTING) 
 I could cum right now. 
 I want you to. 
 (PASSIONATE SIGHING) 
 (BREATHING RETURNING TO NORMAL) 
 You can sleep here. 
 I toss and turn, I wouldn't want to bother you. 
 I'm not a good sleeper anyway. 
 I have to get up early. 
 What time? 
 Five? 
 Six? 
 Five. 
 But I'm only staying 'cause I'm really tired. 
 I'm flattered. 
 (FOOTSTEPS SOUNDING OVER MUFFLED VOICES IN BAR) 
 It's not about you. 
 I'm... having a hard time to understand how it is not about me. 
 I- I just can't make exceptions. 
 I knew this. 
 You knew this? 
 You're gonna sell this hotel. 
 You know, and you're gonna... 
 (SOUNDS OF BUSY RESTAURANT) 
 I have to go New York on the 21st for a number of meetings. 
 I'll be there for three or four days. 
 Do you want to come? 
 I'd love that! 
 Yeah, that'd be amazing. 
 Yeah, I'm gonna be busy during the days but uh-- 
 Ryan! 
 Ohhh! 
 Bill! 
 Bill! 
 What are you doing in town? 
 Oh, Lynn and I came to see a couple of shows and uh, Lynn wanted to do some shopping. 
 Good stuff! Hi, Lynn! 
 So we're staying at the Four Seasons. 
 Oh great... 
 Listen, why don't I, uh- why don't I phone over and then we can all go over for some drinks while you're in town? 
 Sure! Uh- 
 We're here till Sunday evening. 
 Good seeing you. 
 Good seeing you, too. 
 Say hi to Kathleen from us. 
 Will do. 
 Are you okay? 
 Yeah. 
 (SOUND OF CELL PHONE BUZZING) 
 (SOUND OF WATER FALLING IN SHOWER) 
 (CELL PHONE CONTINUES TO BUZZ) 
 (CELL PHONE BUZZES AGAIN) 
 I'm excited about New York! 
 Is this Chelsea? 
 Yes. 
 This is Ryan's wife. 
 Nothing. 
 No response? 
 Then I'll make this quick. 
 How much does he pay you? 
 $1,000? $2,000? 
 Still there? 
 Yes. 
 I'll pay you ten to stay away. 
 What if I don't want your money? 
 $20,000. 
 What name do I make the check out to? 
 I don't accept checks. 
 (SOUNDS OF BUSY AIRPORT TERMINAL) 
 (PHONE RINGING) 
 Hi, Teeny. 
 Can I ask you a question? 
 Of course. 
 Am I abnormally selfish? 
 Well... 
 As in, do you think that I could be a sociopath? 
 Like classic DSM definition? 
 You're not a sociopath, Christine. 
 Well, how can you be sure? 
 Well first off, sociopaths don't ask if they are sociopaths 'cause they don't care. 
 Secondly, I work with sociopaths every single day. 
 I know one when I see one. 
 I'm sorry I called you selfish. 
 That's fine. 
 (SOUND OF APPROACHING HIGH HEEL SHOES) 
 Chelsea? 
 Would you like anything to drink? 
 No, thank you, I'm fine. 
 I'd love another iced tea. 
 Thanks. 
 We have children, did he tell you that? 
 I'm sure he talked about me as well. 
 You're gonna count that in front of me? 
 No. I trust you. 
 Thanks. 
 I keep thinking of all the horrible things I should say to you right now, but I can't because I genuinely feel sorry for you. 
 Stay away from my family. 
 Or I will come after you.
