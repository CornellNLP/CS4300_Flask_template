 [theme music comes up softly] 
 You all right? 
 Yeah. 
 [sound of medical procedure] 
 You have premature aging and fine lines around the eyes. 
 I can take care of that with microdermabrasion and a gentle peel. 
 You also have some congestion in your cheek and nose area. 
 We can take care of that with extractions. 
 It's fine. 
 All three? 
 Yes. 
 [sound of medical apparatus] 
 Put your head back. 
 Marianne est plus intelligente que Juliette. 
 Nantes is less expensive than Paris. 
 Nantes est moins cher que Paris. 
 Nantes est moins cher que Paris. 
 I work as much as she does. 
 Je travaille autant qu'elle. 
 Je travaille autant qu'elle. 
 Je travaille autant qu'elle. 
 [sound of limousine driving] 
 [whispers] Je travaille autant qu'elle. 
 [footsteps on marble floor] 
 [elevator doors opening] 
 [man sighing erotically] 
 [man sighing passionately] 
 [whisperirng] Oh, God... 
 You're so good at this. 
 [man grunting during s#x] 
 I'm gonna c#m... 
 Do it. 
 I want you to. 
 [man climaxing] 
 [man's breathing returning to normal] 
 Call me soon? 
 I will. 
 He has a good heart. 
 Il a bon coeur. 
 Very good. 
 Très bien. 
 He is a good student. 
 Il est bon étudiant. 
 It's not nice to say that. 
 Ce n'est pas bien de dire ça. 
 I'll have the baby greens and the lamb, please. 
 We recommend it pink. 
 That's fine. 
 I'll just have the salad, please. 
 You can order something else, I'm paying. 
 The duck's really good. And so is the salmon. 
 No, I'm okay with just the salad. 
 Okay. 
 And a bottle of the Domaine Le Miscou, please. 
 Of course. 
 It's full-bodied and really minerally. You'll like it. 
 I had better, for $300 a bottle. 
 So, are you happy? 
 Yeah, very. 
 Did you decide if you're going back? 
 Where? To law school? 
 No, it's over. 
 You could always finish somewhere else. 
 I don't want to. I'm done. 
 So you're going to be an escort the rest of your life? 
 Where are you staying? 
 The Radisson. 
 That's nice. 
 How's work? 
 It's stressful. The case loads are relentless, and dealing with the other attorneys isn't always fun. 
 I don't know how you do it. 
 Because it's my job. 
 You could always do something else. 
 Are you seriously giving me career advice? 
 I didn't mean anything by it. 
 I'm just making conversation. 
 How's Mom? 
 She's fine. 
 She misses you. 
 Oh, she wanted me to take a picture of us and send it to her. 
 [shutter clicking] 
 That's cute. 
 I'll be right back. I'm gonna use the restroom. 
 La Domaine Le Miscou. 
 Great. 
 [waiter opening bottle of wine] 
 [waiter pouring wine] 
 It's fine, thanks. 
 [sound of limousine driving] 
 You've had a busy week. 
 Yeah. It's been fun. 
 [glass placed on bar, pouring alcoholic beverage] 
 [sound of sealing bottle] 
 [piped-in music in lobby] 
 Good afternoon. 
 Yeah. 
 Yeah, that's correct. 
 [high heels on marble floor] 
 [piped-in music in ascending elevator] 
 [muffled footsteps on carpeting in hallway] 
 [man sighing anxiously] 
 [knocking on door, setting down glass] 
 [opening door] 
 Hey. 
 [sound of kissing] 
 How'd the meeting with RDP go? 
 It was fine. 
 Where were you? 
 I was at lunch with Cynthia. 
 Hmm. 
 Well, you didn't tell me that. 
 Yeah, it was last-minute. 
 Where'd you go? 
 Where did you go? 
 Why are you so insecure? It's really unattractive. 
 Answer the question! 
 Alinea. 
 Are you lying to me? 
 You're lying, aren't you? 
 You were with Derek. 
 I want to know! 
 I already told you. 
 Did he f#ck you? 
 Yes! 
 You just had s*x with him? 
 What did you do? 
 Did you s#ck his c#ck? 
 Did he c#m in your mouth? 
 Yeah. 
 He did. 
 And then I wanted more, so I got him hard again and f#cked him. 
 Is that what you wanna hear? 
 [knocking on front door] 
 Who is it? 
 [door opening] 
 Derek? 
 Yes. 
 [whispering] We spoke on the phone, I'm Amanda. 
 There's an envelope for you on the counter. 
 We've already started. 
 Thanks. 
 [man opening envelope] 
 Do you need a moment? 
 No, I'm good. 
 I'm so glad you're here. 
 I was worried for a second you weren't gonna come. 
 I'm glad I'm here also. 
 I couldn't stop thinking about you. 
 I couldn't stop thinking about you, too. 
 I've never felt this way before. 
 Don't look at me. 
 Me neither. 
 I'm falling in love with you, and I don't know what to do. 
 I think you should leave him. 
 [whispering] Don't look at him. 
 [whispering] Do you need a moment? 
 Yeah, sorry. 
 Can you give us a second? We just need to get on the same page. 
 Okay. 
 Can you shut the door? 
 [door closing] 
 [man's aroused breathing] 
 Is there anything I can do, to make you feel comfortable? 
 No, I'll be fine. 
 Okay. 
 Have we met before? 
 No. 
 You look familiar. 
 I get that all the time. 
 We can just jump right in, if the talking is throwing you. 
 Yeah, yeah, that might help. 
 Okay. 
 Ready? Good to go? 
 Yeah. 
 Gordon! 
 Yeah? 
 We're ready. 
 Is everything okay? 
 Yes. 
 Where do you want us? 
 Where do you want him to f#ck you? 
 Right here. On the couch. 
 I missed you. 
 [whispering] Sorry. 
 It's okay. 
 What did you say? 
 I said he's so hard right now. 
 [whispering] Oh, you're perfect. 
 [erotic breathing] 
 I wanna go down on you. 
 Do it. 
 I'm so w#t. 
 [erotic breathing] 
 I'm so turned on, I could c#m right now. 
 I want you to c#m. 
 [Christine's aroused sighs] 
 I want you in my mouth. 
 [whispering] Your c#ck's so big. 
 You taste so good. 
 I want you to c#m in my mouth. 
 [man climaxing] 
 Should we wait for him? 
 No, I want you to f#ck me. 
 But doesn't he wanna watch? 
 Yeah. He'll come back. 
 Can you last? 
 Yeah. 
 Great. 
 Put this on. 
 How do you like it? 
 From behind. 
 [Christine's passionate sighing] 
 [faster erotic breathing] 
 [man climaxing in sink] 
 Oh my, oh f#ck. 
 Oh f#ck! 
 [Christine moaning with pleasure] 
 That feels so good. 
 Are you gonna stop me? 
 No. 
 Are you jealous? 
 Yes! 
 Oh, that feels so good. 
 [Christine's erotic sighing] 
 Don't touch me. 
 I wanna look at you. 
 [Christine moaning with pleasure] 
 Harder. 
 I want you to c#m with me. 
 C#m with me. 
 [Derek climaxing] 
 That was amazing. 
 I love you. 
 I love you. 
 I'll be right back. 
 Okay. 
 I've never been f#cked like that before in my life. 
 I'm sorry. 
 Come here. 
 I'm gonna tell him about us. 
 How do you think he'll respond? 
 I don't know. I don't care. 
 I wanna be with you. 
 What do you wanna do? 
 I don't know. 
 Maybe we can get a place together? 
 Are you sure? 
 Yeah, I can't stand to look at him anymore. 
 [sound of kissing] 
 [whispering] You can leave now. 
 Go. 
 I should get going. 
 When am I gonna see you again? 
 Soon. 
 Wait. My phone... 
 I got it. 
 I'll call you. 
 I love you. 
 I love you, too. 
 [door opening and closing] 
 You never c#m when we have s*x. 
 That's because I hate you. 
 And I don't wanna be with you anymore. 
 I want to taste you. 
 [Christine pleasing herself] 
 [erotic breathing] 
 [passionate sighing] 
 [sound of orgasm]
