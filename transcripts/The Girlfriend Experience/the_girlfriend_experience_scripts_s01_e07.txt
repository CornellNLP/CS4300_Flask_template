 Previously on The Girlfriend Experience: 
 What happened today with the guy? 
 What guy? 
 The guy that you were talking to at the pool. 
 Did you know him? 
 No. 
 He asked me if I was alone, I said no. 
 Were you attracted to him? 
 (SOUND OF DOOR OPENING) 
 I forgot my phone. 
 You'd loose your head... 
 ...if it wasn't screwed on. 
 Take it in all the way. 
 Hello. 
 Hey... 
 I miss you already. How did you get this number? I didn't give you this number, Jack. Christine? Hey, I didn't hear from you yesterday, and I got worried... (CELL PHONE BUZZING) I do not want you in my f*cking life, Jack. Do you understand? Never call me again! What's the status on those provisionals? You'll have them by the end of the day? Yes! I- I've got it under control. Okay. Do you have multiple partners? Yes. Have you had unprotected s*x since your last exam? No. And when was your last Pap smear? Ahh, over a year ago. Okay. There's going to be a little bit of pressure. So just try to relax. (SOUND OF CHRISTINE SIGHING) Miss Reade? Hi, Ben. Uh, someone sent you these. Would you mind taking these to my apartment for me? Sure. They say it's supposed to rain this weekend. Hmmm? The weather... It-It's supposed to rain. I heard that. (SOUND OF KEY UNLOCKING FRONT DOOR) (SOUND OF OPENING DOOR) Would you just wait while I turn my lights on? Sure. (SOUND OF SOLITARY FOOTSTEPS) (SOUND OF TESTING LOCKED DOOR) Thanks. Everything okay? Yeah, it's all good. Call down if you need anything. I will. Thanks, Ben. (SOUND OF SHUTTING, LOCKING DOOR) (SOUND OF RUNNING WATER IN SINK) (SOUND OF TURNING OFF RUNNING WATER) (SOUND OF USING TOILET PAPER) (SOUND OF OPENING TAMPON WRAPPER) (SOUND OF TOSSING OBJECT IN TRASH CAN) (SOUND OF FLUSHING TOILET) (SOUND OF WORKMAN INSTALLING SECURITY SYSTEM) Living room's Camera One. The hallways are Camera Two. And the bedrooms are Cameras Three and Four. It's set to record 24-7, unless you program it otherwise. It's a one-week buffer. Got it. Thanks. I want to hear you talk about the iron condors... Iron butterflies, fences, collars, strangles and straddles. (MAN'S LAUGHTER) They make crunching numbers sound sexier than it actually is. Quantitative analysis is... very boring. I think it's pretty hot. No, you don't. Okay, it's hot when you talk about it because you're obviously good at your job. And that's a major turn on for me. Where did- Where'd you learn those terms? Can't a girl have a stock hobby, slash habit? I can talk you through where to invest your money, if you're serious. I'm serious. That'd be great. My wife hates when I talk about work. Maybe that's why we're here. Do you want to um, Yes. I love that you ask me what I want, but I want to know what you want. I want to know what an iron condor looks like. (SOUND OF MAN'S EROTIC BREATHING) (SOUND OF CLICKING CAMERA) You want any more hot stock talk? Say that ten times fast. Hot stock talk, hot stock talk, hot stock talk, hot stock talk... Bear call spread. Show me that. What do you really want? I want to ride your face. (SOUND OF MAN SIGHING PASSIONATELY) (SOUND OF MAN'S EROTIC BREATHING) (SOUND OF CHRISTINE'S EXCITED BREATHING) (SOUND OF CAR ENGINE) (SOUND OF CAR ACCELERATING) (SOUND OF CAR ENGINE DECELERATING) (SOUND OF PARKING CAR IN DRIVEWAY) (SOUND OF OPENING AND CLOSING CAR DOOR) (SOUNDS OF UNLOCKING, OPENING FRONT DOOR) (SOUND OF FRONT DOOR CLOSING) (SOUNDS OF PARKING CAR, OPENING DOOR) (CAR DOOR CLOSING) (SOUND OF DOORBELL RINGING) Alex Peyton? Yes? My name is Simon Burcher. I'm a private investigator. I have a few questions about an acquaintance of yours. What's this about? I am investigating a woman named Chelsea Rayne. Perhaps your wife knows her? This will only take a second. (FRONT DOOR CLOSING) My wife has nothing to do with this. I'm very aware that your wife has nothing to do with this. Everything okay? Yeah. This gentleman just needs directions. My GPS got me all turned around. These streets, once you leave the city, always confuse me. I'll just get him back on the 90. Good luck. Sorry to bother you. Have a nice evening. She seems nice. Hand me your cell. How have you got her listed in here? Is there another way we can do this? I barely know her. You two seemed friendly enough. She's listed as... Donald Metcalf. I want an introduction. Tell her I'm a partner in Bishop Burcher, an accounting firm here in town. Make it work. Hi, it's Chelsea. Leave a message and I'll get back to you. Hey, Chelsea, it's Alex. I just was talking about you with a good friend mine, Simon Burcher, and he'd love to meet you. Can we make three copies of this and send one to Tariq Barr? Thank you. Can you get Harrison on the phone? Now? Right now. Okay. Thank you. Yeah, could you get Harrison on the phone? (SOUND OF DOOR TO DAVID'S OFFICE SHUTTING) Hey. I'm working on Eisner Trading and Arc Futures for Skip and I have to cross-reference some of David's cases. Can I use your password? No. I have to get them into Skip by the end of the day, and I need to make sure they're not infringing. You're making your job way too complicated. Just check the PTO website. But the files that I'm looking for are patent applications. They're not gonna be in public record for 18 months. Okay, why don't you just tell me what you're looking for and I'll check? Kayla, we work for the same company. Not yet. Ten interns, two slots. Remember? It's Alex. Hi, how are you? Good. I'm at a dinner meeting, what's up? Your friend, Simon, called me. I just wanted to touch base with you before I called him back. How long have you known him? About five years. Yeah, that's right. He does tax prep for us here at Rainsford. He's a great guy. A little quiet at first, but I think you'll probably like him. (SOUND OF REMOTE CONTROL) (SOUND OF REMOTE CONTROL CLICKING IN BACKGROUND) (SOUND OF TURNING ON SOUND WITH REMOTE) (SOUND OF EROTIC BREATHING) (CLICKING ZOOM ON REMOTE) (EROTIC BREATHING ACCELERATES WITH PLEASURE) (SOUND OF SLOWER BREATHING, AND SATISFACTION) 
 
 Do you have any children? Two... A boy and a girl. Fifteen and thirteen. They live with their mother. It's good, it's amicable. We split up when they were kids, and we've... figured things out over the years. So how am I doing for a first-timer? Am I passing the test? There's no test, we're just seeing if we like each other. And? Well, what are you looking for? Just someone to spend some time with. I work a lot, so it can be difficult to meet people, given my schedule. I don't have a lot of free time, but of course... I'd make time to see you. How often were you thinking? (SOUND OF ORGANIZING PAPERS) Here they are. Are they all clear? Yes, they're fine. I was just erring on the side of caution. Anything else? That's it. Great. David's furious. He wants me to deliver Erin all supporting documentation for XHP, but I can't find all the files. They should be on the server. Unless someone deleted them. Well, they're not. Look, I know you worked on the case. Do you have any time to double-check and walk me through it? I'll need access to the files. I'll give you my password. But don't go behind my back and make me look bad. Kayla, I'm on your side. It'll be fine. (SOUND OF TYPING ON KEYBOARD) (SOUND OF TYPING ON KEYBOARD) (MORE TYPING ON KEYBOARD) (SOUND OF TAXI DRIVING IN CITY) (SOUND OF ELEVATOR DOOR CLOSING) (SOUNDS OF SOFT KNOCKING, DOOR OPENING) Hi. Hi. Come on in. (DOOR CLOSING) Here's your fee. It's $2,000 in cash, like we discussed, you can... Feel free to count it. Thanks. In twenty $100 bills. Great. Can I get you a drink? I'm fine, thanks. (SOUND OF ENVELOPE BEING PUT AWAY) (SOUND OF CHRISTINE REMOVING JACKET) (SOUNDS OF PUTTING DOWN GLASS, LONG SIGH) There's no reason to be nervous. It's just you and me, okay? Yeah. What do you like? I don't know. It's hard for me to talk about. Maybe I'm not ready. It's okay. There's no rush. I want to... (SOUND OF MAN SIGHING) You can tell me. What are my choices? Tell me what my choices are. I want you to tell me. Well, I can... I can touch you. Do you like that? When I touch your skin? Yeah. And here? Yeah. What else? I want to hear you say it. What are my choices? Would you give me a minute? I-I have to take care of something before we, you know, continue. I'll be right back. Sure, okay. (SOUND OF BATHROOM DOOR OPENING AND CLOSING) (SOUND OF DOOR RE-OPENING) I'm not feeling well. I'm-I'm gonna go home. Here. Uh, we can re-schedule. I can call you when I'm feeling better. Why don't you just lie down for a little while? Maybe it'll pass. Just lie down for a minute. Maybe you'll feel better. Really. I'm gonna go. I'll call you. I'm leaving your money on the table. Your call has been forwarded to an automated voice messaging system. Alex Peyton. At the tone, please record your message. (TONE SOUNDS) Alex, this is Chelsea, I was just with your friend, Simon. Can you please call me back? Tell me what my choices are. I want you to tell me. Well, I... I can touch you. Do you like that when I touch your skin? Yeah. And here? Yeah. (SOUND OF KISSING) What else? But I want to hear you say it. What are my choices? Would you give me a minute? I just-I have to take care of somethig before, we, you know, continue. I'll be right back. (CELL PHONE RINGING) (CELL PHONE BUZZING) Excuse me one sec. Sure. Hello. It didn't work. Well, I don't know what to say. That's not going to cut it, Jacqueline. I gave her up to you. I don't know what else I can do. Well, you better hope that she caves, otherwise, I'm coming after you. Do you understand? (SOUND OF JACQUELINE SIGHING) (SOUND OF SHUFFLING PAPERS) (SOUND OF CHRISTINE RUMMAGING INSIDE HER HANDBAG) Chelsea! Hi, it's Simon Burcher. Uh, I hope you're feeling better. Uh, listen, I'd love to see you again. The sooner the better. Hopefully, I won't make your stomach turn again. Ahh, anyway, call me, 312... (SOUND OF CHRISTINE TOSSING HER CELL PHONE IN BAG) You wanna share a cab? It's already ten? Did you have a chance to look at XHP? There are files missing. But we'll find them. I just need another day. Okay. So you wanna share a cab? Well I can't leave yet. I still have too much work. Alright... See you tomorrow. Don't worry. Thanks. (SOUND OF ELEVATOR MOVING) (SOUND OF ELEVATOR OPENING) Christine? I'm not gonna hurt you. I just want to talk. Who the f*ck are you? What do you want? Tomorrow, you're gonna to call Peter Gramercy, or have a lawyer call Peter Gramercy, and you're gonna tell him that you're disclaiming any and all interests in Michael Cilic's estate. Who are you? It doesn't matter. What does matter is that I know who you are. Christine Reade. Born June 27th, 1989, at Mercy Hospital in Philadelphia. Your parents are James and Mary Reade, they're both high school teachers, and you have one sibling, an elder sister, Annabel, who is an Assistant DA in Arlington County, Virginia. You're a 2nd-year law student at Chicago-Burnham, and you intern here on the 39th floor at Kirkland and Allen for Skip Hadderly. Do you want me to continue? I didn't think so. Now... If you don't make this call, everyone will find out what you really do for a living. Your friends, your family, your law professors. Am I clear? Good. Have a good night.
