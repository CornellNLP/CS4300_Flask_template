 Previously on The Americans... 
 A few months ago, a family was murdered in a hotel in Alexandria. 
 Gaad : Wasn't there a son? 
 He was down at the pool when it happened. 
 Didn't see anything till he came up and found them. 
 Have you ever seen these people before? 
 I'm Ann Chadwick from the Child Advocacy Center. 
 Healing... it's gonna take time. 
 I'm sorry you have to work with Captain Larrick. 
 He's dangerous and unpredictable and puts you and your family at risk. 
 You're back already? 
 Yeah, I had a personal emergency. 
 [ Telephone rings ] 
 Hello? 
 [ Southern accent ] Hey, is Bobby there? 
 Bobby who? 
 [ Door shuts ] 
 [ Sighs ] 
 How was study group? 
 Fine. 
 There's lasagna in the refrigerator, if you want me to heat anything up. 
 I'm not hungry. 
 Okay. 
 Can I ask you a question? 
 Why won't you let me go to the summer retreat? 
 Because I don't think it's the right thing for you to do this summer. 
 But why? Can you give me one good reason why? 
 Because I'm your mother. 
 [ Water runs, stops ] 
 [ Door opens ] 
 The FBI knows about Emmett and Leanne. 
 Are you sure? 
 Yeah. The bug's back up. 
 I mean, the sound quality is a little off. 
 They were talking about it in Gaad's office. 
 And they know that Emmett and Leanne worked for the KGB. 
 And Stan Beeman paid their son a visit. 
 sh1t. 
 I signaled The Centre. 
 What'd they say? 
 [ Sighs ] 
 Haven't heard back yet. 
 I'm gonna go see Jared. 
 No. No. It is too risky right now. 
 He could be under surveillance. 
 If he is, I'll see that, and I'll stay away. 
 The Centre's gonna want to know what Stan said to him about his parents. 
 You think you can count on the bug for that in the next 24 hours? 
 I want to know. 
 I never gave him Leanne's letter. 
 [ Sighs ] 
 You did what you thought was best. 
 I made a promise. 
 And now he may have found out from an American. 
 [ Typewriter keys clacking ] 
 [ Indistinct conversations ] 
 [ Door opens ] Sir? 
 Emmett Connors died at the age of 4 from a raccoon bite... rabies. 
 His KGB partner assumed the identity of Leanne Riley, who died at birth in Springfield, Missouri. 
 What did her autopsy report say? 
 No scar from a bullet wound on her torso. 
 You should be happy. Your girl was telling the truth. 
 Yep. 
 On the other hand, how the hell many illegals are there in the DC area... Four? Six? 
 A dozen? 
 Are you all right, Beeman? 
 I'm fine, sir. 
 Things are a little... unsettled at home. 
 Ah. 
 Marriage. No time-outs. 
 No. 
 I've been married 17 years. 
 Happily, for the most part. 
 Luck of the draw. 
 Here. 
 What's this? 
 Your commendation... the Agency's way of saying thank you for dispatching Dameran. 
 Jared : Why are you here? 
 Just to see you, see how you're doing. 
 What's new? 
 Uh, uh, what do you mean? 
 How's school? 
 Okay. [ Chuckles ] 
 An FBI agent came to see me. 
 Really? Why? 
 He said it had something to do with the murders. 
 What? 
 I don't know. He didn't say. 
 It upset you? 
 Yeah. 
 What did he want to know? 
 Um... uh, he showed me... 
 He showed me two drawings of people, and some photos. 
 Your parents? 
 No, somebody else. 
 I don't know. He just... he just wanted to know if I'd seen them before, if... if I knew who they were. 
 Do you? 
 No. 
 I'm not stupid. 
 I know you're not. 
 I don't... I don't know what's going on, but I want to know what's going on. 
 Did he say anything else, the FBI agent? 
 Yeah. He said I should call him if I remembered anything or if anything suspicious happened. 
 Fred : I scoured the budgets on our aeronautics programs and found an anomaly in one numbered C212. 
 It's a category of $100 million, coded as non-accountable. 
 Philip : What does that mean? 
 It could mean anything. 
 Either the bean counters at Lockheed don't know, or they don't want  me  to know. 
 $100 million would create a large hole. 
 It's a lot of expenditures. But against what? There's no... there's no goods, no services. There's not even a code name. 
 It really makes you feel like there's a flashing red light. 
 Stealth? 
 I don't know what else it could be. 
 Do you think you could find out? 
 I'm the numbers guy. 
 There's no way I can get into that. 
 There's a guy... John Skeevers, uh, an aeronautics engineer. Brilliant. 
 He worked for Lockheed for years. 
 We both like fly fishing. 
 He helped develop the SR-71. 
 Uh, the spy plane? 
 Yeah. It had features that helped reduce its radar signature. 
 So, where is he now? 
 He's going through a bad time. 
 Bitter divorce, and then he got the double whammy... cancer. 
 Started making crackpot claims about how the company poisoned him, so they invited him to leave. 
 [ Birds chirping ] 
 [ Click ] 
 [ Woman speaking indistinctly on PA system ] 
 It shouldn't be too long. 
 [ Sighs ] 
 Aliens, huh? 
 You believe they're out there? 
 There's a lot out there you wouldn't believe. 
 Yeah, like they got time to shove a probe up the ass of some hayseed that fell off a turnip truck. 
 Yeah, government, military... they're all in on it. 
 Hmm? 
 Oh, I was in Vietnam. 
 Strange brew, man. 
 Hamburger Hill messed up my head, turned it inside out. 
 They poisoned me. 
 Who? 
 Oh, they'll deny it... 
 Say it's unrelated, my cancer... 
 Anecdotal. [ Sighs ] 
 Bastards. 
 [ Bell dings ] 
 Woman : 96! 
 You, uh... 
 96! 
 [ Grunts ] 
 That's you, man. 
 Mm. 
 96! 
 Sorry. 
 [ Grunts ] 
 [ Woman speaking indistinctly on PA system ] 
 My goddamn wallet. 
 I'm sorry, sir. This isn't enough. [ Coins clatter ] 
 Well, how much is enough? 
 How short is he? 
 $277. 
 You all right? 
 I don't know what happened to it. 
 You're okay. It's okay. 
 Thank you. 
 [ Knock on door ] 
 [ Sighs ] 
 [ Muffled indistinct conversation ] 
 [ Clears throat ] 
 [ Liquid pouring ] 
 Philip : Hey. 
 Yeah, I just got side-swiped with an overwhelming urge for PB&B, actually... peanut butter and banana? 
 [ Sighs ] 
 How much longer you're not gonna talk to me? 
 What do you want me to say? 
 I have nothing to say. 
 [ Sighs ] Paige... 
 Am I supposed to talk to you whenever you want to talk to me? 
 Is that a rule? Because I wasn't aware of that rule. 
 You don't have to act like this. 
 I'm a prisoner in my own house. How am I supposed to act? 
 [ Telephone rings ] 
 Hello? 
 Elizabeth : He seems okay. 
 He was shown drawings and photos of a man and a woman, asked if he'd ever seen them before. 
 And... and you think it's...? 
 Could be. 
 Well, did he say he'd seen them? 
 No. 
 But, uh... 
 What? 
 Just the way he looked at me. 
 It's probably nothing. 
 He met with Kate. 
 What? 
 I saw him with her. 
 Maybe they're just a step ahead of us. 
 They're supposed to be taking care of him. 
 You don't sound so sure. 
 She hadn't done anything to make herself look any different to him. 
 She was just herself. 
 
 
 
 [ Keys clatter ] 
 [ Door opens, shuts ] 
 [ Toilet flushes ] 
 [ Yells, grunts ] 
 Aah! [ Grunts ] 
 Aah! 
 [ Both grunting ] 
 [ Groans ] 
 [ Grunting ] 
 [ Knock on door ] 
 Hello? 
 It's Philip. 
 Oh, hey. Come on in. 
 It's open. 
 Hey. 
 Hey. 
 Quick question. 
 Yeah. 
 [ Chuckling ] So, Henry has to write a report for school, uh, about "My Hero." 
 Uh, naturally, I thought I'd be the shoo-in, but you can't write about your dad, so he would like to interview you. 
 Wow, I'm... flattered. 
 Well, I'm envious, 'cause you've made quite the impression, but I guess, um, a travel agent can't compete with the FBI. 
 Except when it comes to cars. 
 [ Chuckles ] So, uh, what's new? 
 Mm, nothing much. You? 
 Can't complain. Do. Sandra home? 
 Uh, no. Not yet. 
 No. 
 Hey, you want a beer or something? 
 Sure. 
 [ Knock on door ] 
 [ Speaks Russian ] 
 What's wrong? 
 I can't reach George. 
 Did you leave a message? 
 I've been trying for the past three hours. 
 His answering machine's off. 
 Left her a signal. 
 It's funny about George. 
 I'll try again in two hours. 
 If it's still off, we should radio The Centre. 
 Might be power out or something. But, yeah, okay. 
 I, uh... 
 I think we should let Paige be a counselor at the church camp. 
 It's only for the summer. 
 Have you said something to her? 
 No. 
 We already said no. 
 I know that, but I think it would show that we trust her. 
 I won't let her be indoctrinated by the church. 
 They get them when they're young. 
 It's what they do. You know it's what they do. 
 I just don't want to crush her spirit. 
 I can't do it. 
 I won't. 
 You know where to hide things, I'll give you that. 
 You people destroyed my life. 
 Not that I didn't have a hand in it. 
 An unwilling hand, but... [ Sighs ] 
 I made my bed, and now I will have to lie in it... as will you. 
 Okay. Let's see. 
 Frequencies. 
 And when's your next transmission? 
 They repeat, don't they, every hour or so, for the agent in the field's convenience? 
 [ Sighs ] 
 [ Sighs ] Decoding with a one-time pad... 
 I've always hated this. 
 Hi. 
 Hey. 
 Uh, where's Matthew? 
 Uh, he's at Harry's house. 
 What's that? 
 Nothing. Just work. 
 Please don't ask me anything you don't want to know. 
 Uh... these, um, past months have... been a real, uh, gut check. 
 I, um... 
 I feel... I felt... 
 I'm not looking for sympathy. 
 And I'm not trying to place blame. 
 I think it's... pointless. 
 [ Sighs ] Don't you? 
 Yeah. 
 So... are we done? 
 I don't know. 
 I don't know how you're supposed to know. 
 Do you? 
 No. 
 [ Sighs ] 
 I know I feel better about myself. 
 [ Scoffs ] 
 [ Sighs ] 
 I'm glad. 
 Okay. 
 You want to hear your message? 
 [ Clears throat ] 
 Your bosses in Moscow... say, "Cannot connect with answering service. 
 Report similar issues." 
 Well, that's gonna be a problem, because the answering service... is shut down. 
 I can feel them getting nervous. 
 Can you? 
 Next, they're not gonna be able to find you, and that's really gonna make them jumpy. 
 Now, you know... it's not you that I want. 
 It's the scumbags who killed my friends. 
 Where are they? 
 You didn't leave any evidence of them around, not even in your little compartment over there. 
 Hey... you were good at your job. 
 Where are they? 
 [ Spits ] 
 [ Clicks tongue ] 
 [ Whimpering ] 
 [ Inhales sharply ] 
 [ Crack ] 
 Nina... 
 [ Breathing shakily ] 
 What do you want? 
 Found it in the clinic, under your chair. 
 I... It must have fallen out. 
 And, uh, I got soup. 
 Can I come in? 
 Are you, uh... you hungry? 
 No. 
 Oh, you... uh, you got to eat, keep up your strength. 
 Sit down. 
 Who are you? 
 Ted. 
 Do I know you? 
 Uh, yeah. 
 We, uh... we met at the clinic. 
 Oh, wow. You got enough pills here to choke a horse. 
 Come eat before it gets cold. 
 It's, uh... it's good. 
 Memory's shot. 
 The cancer spread. 
 It's in my brain. 
 That's what killed the bats. 
 You got kids? 
 Uh, yeah. 
 Leave them something instead of heartache. 
 [ Slurps ] 
 I can help you with that. 
 With what? 
 Money. 
 Why don't you tell me about Ram? [ Sighs ] 
 I don't know about that. 
 You worked on SR-71. 
 Oh. 
 They poisoned me... 
 Tossed me away. 
 Who are you? 
 Does it matter? 
 [ Sighs ] 
 It didn't work. 
 Ram didn't work? 
 [ Sighs ] It was too heavy, clunky. 
 It's in my brain. 
 I'm sorry. 
 We made it out of tiles... 
 Hard stuff. That didn't work. 
 So we tried these... tiny, little balls. 
 Microscopic. 
 Iron-ball paint. 
 [ Voice breaking ] That's what killed them. 
 Killed who? 
 The bats. 
 Dead bats all over the floor... from the fumes. 
 From the paint fumes? 
 Yeah, that's what did it... the paint. 
 Absorbs the radar... hides the planes. 
 It killed the bats. 
 It killed me, too. 
 Elizabeth : In here. 
 It's paint. 
 The radar-absorbent material... microscopic iron balls suspended in paint. 
 The Centre hasn't heard from Kate. 
 She didn't make a scheduled transmission. 
 That's not unusual, except we haven't heard from... 
 Still nothing from George. 
 So, what the hell's going on? 
 They just sent us her address. 
 I think we need to... [ Footsteps ] 
 I understand you have control over me... what I do, where I go, and who I see... until I'm 18, but... who I am and what I think and feel and believe... is mine. 
 I'm me. 
 There's a protest at an air-force base in Pennsylvania this weekend, and they're having them all around the country at bases that fly bombers with nuclear weapons. 
 A group from church is going. 
 I want to go, too. 
 We'd be leaving tomorrow after school, and it's chaperoned, and... 
 Okay. 
 I think it's a worthwhile cause and... and sounds like a good idea. 
 Thank you. 
 We need to check on Kate. 
 Yeah. 
 So, how long have you been an FBI agent? 
 14 years. 
 Do you like it? 
 I do. Here you go. 
 Thank you. 
 What do you like most about it? 
 Well... 
 I feel like I'm doing something good... worthwhile. 
 All right. What did you want to be as a kid? 
 I wanted to be an FBI agent. 
 Really? 
 Yep. 
 How come? 
 I read their comic books. 
 The FBI has comic books? 
 Well,  about  them... you know, like Aquaman or Spider-Man, except these were about FBI men chasing the bad guys, like John Dillinger. 
 He was a notorious bank robber. 
 The FBI nabbed him in a big shootout outside a movie theater in Chicago. 
 Wow. 
 Yeah, stuff like that. 
 [ Chuckles ] Well, is it fun? 
 Sometimes. 
 Well, what's it like to be a hero? 
 I'm not a hero, Henry. 
 [ Door opens ] 
 [ Door closes ] 
 Arkady knows I've been providing you with information. 
 Oleg told him? 
 I can't go back. 
 It's okay. It's gonna be okay. 
 [ Crying ] No. No, it won't be okay, Stan. 
 I can never go back. 
 They will send me to Moscow! 
 They will put me on a trial! 
 But you're safe here, Nina. 
 I can't go back. 
 I will not let anything happen to you. 
 Where will I go? 
 What will happen to me, Stan? 
 I will find a way out... for you  and  for me. 
 Nothing will come between us, Nina, ever. 
 Nothing. 
 [ Whimpers ] 
 I realized something today. 
 What? 
 Paige is like me. 
 She wants to make a difference in the world. 
 She's just looking in the wrong place. 
 What does it say? 
 "Get Jared out."
