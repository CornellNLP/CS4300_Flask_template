 Philip : So, we take orders from you  now? 
 Think of me as Gabriel, but... prettier. 
 Coming to you live from the home of the Secretary of Defense. 
 Nott :  The Prime Minister fully supports your efforts to build a ballistic missile shield, provided it covers Europe, as well as the United States. 
 We're just starting out here. 
 You're starting out. 
 The day you forced me to work for you, my life got very scary. 
 I was 17 when I joined the KGB. 
 When we got here, I was 22 years old, living in a strange house in a strange country with a strange man. 
 It never really happened for us, but I feel like it's happening now. 
 Reporter :  Tensions escalated on the Polish border as Soviet troops continued their show of force in response to growing unrest inspired by the solidarity Trade Union Movement. 
 Government sources called the Russian military exercises troubling and destabilizing. - Where's Poland? It's part of Russia. Oh. Is that what Mr. Henrickson is teaching you? Uh, yeah. Same neighborhood. You guys, we have to go. Come on. You need to eat something. I'm not hungry. Here. Take this with you. Come on, Henry. Okay. Um...are we still on, or...? Yeah, of course. Okay. Uh, on for what? None of your business. Let's go. Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on. - Henry, lunch. Henry : Oh, yeah. Thank you. ...both Poland and potentially the entire Eastern Bloc.  -  No, you  do. So, gentlemen, Customs just stopped the son of the Romanian Deputy Chief of Mission on his way back to Bucharest with three pounds of marijuana. Three pounds? Well, he either really likes the stuff, or that's a commie with a little business instinct. They're swinging him by here before they do their paperwork. Do you know what they do with drug dealers in Romania? Why don't you guys take a run at him, see if he wants to keep his balls. [ Knock on door ] Privet. Da. This works. Trust me. What time is the Romanian genius getting here? Uh... [ Clears throat ] Zdrast-vui-te. Nyet. Still waiting on him, sir. Get in the vault. The President's been shot. Let's go, people. Right now! Come on! [ Telephones ringing ] [ Indistinct conversations ] Thank you. For what? For making us take the afternoon off. Hmm. That's what you want to thank me for? Mm-hmm. [ Laughs ] Reporter :  This is the moment of the first gunshot. Secret Serviceman Jerry Parr falls on the President, pushes him -- - I need to know Peters. On it. Get everything you can from Secret Service about the shooter. I need to know if he has any Soviet connection whatsoever. This guy said "Nyet" once in the past 10 years, we're gonna find out when and where. Yes, sir. Team on the embassy, sir? Yeah, but not you. The bullet is believed to, uh, be a .22-caliber bullet. Man: What happened? Man #2: I'm just hearing. Possibly as many as six shots... from the .22-caliber weapon were fired... Woman: It's awful. ...we're told by law-enforcement officers... [ Elevator bell dings ] ...just outside the Washington Hilton Hotel, as the President emerged from that hotel about 2:30 this afternoon Washington time. Haig :  Constitutionally, gentlemen, you have the President, the Vice President, and the Secretary of State, in that order, and should the President decide he wants to transfer the helm to the Vice President, he will do so. Reporter: What is -- As of now, I am in control here in the White House pending return of the Vice President and in close touch with him. If something came up, I would check with him. What's happening? The President's been shot. Oh, my God. Is he okay? Nobody knows. News says he's in surgery. Reporter :  James Brady, the 40-year-old White House Press Secretary... I'll find Charles. I'll check the signal site and go home and check the shortwave. I'll see you at home. [ Telephones ringing ] [ Indistinct conversations ] Where are you on the shooter? Eighth floor is in the process of putting together a bio and profile. Is he a KGB operative? The eighth floor will soon let us all know that Hinckley worked at 31 flavors when he was 16. Please, look for connections to the Soviet Union and the Communist Party. I want you to set up a meet A.S.A.P. with your friend. The Rezidentura are gonna be all over their people. I'm aware of the risks. But our number-one priority is finding out what the KGB knows about this. All right, I'll leave a signal for her to meet in the next 24 hours. Agent Beeman, we're operating on a tight time frame. 24 hours is like two weeks. I understand that, sir, but she's living her life in a tight time frame, too. It gets even shorter if we're not careful. I get it that you don't want to send her to the slaughterhouse. But if the President has been shot by a KGB operative, I want to know before nuclear missiles start whistling over my head. You get to your girl. You get to her now. Do you think what's on the news is true? Sam Donaldson was there when the gun was fired. I believe him. But since they closed the doors at George Washington, no actual information's getting out. It's all completely sanitized by the White House press office. Can you get the real story? Not today. Look, Reagan's cronies love me. There's nothing better than a former socialist turned conservative raising the hue and cry about the evils of communism, but I am still a member of the press. Today, I have no access at all. What about the names of the nursing staff -- those who were around the president? Can you get me those? That I could do. Say I was writing a piece, but those people aren't going to talk to you. Just get me the names. Frankly, I hope the b*st*rd bleeds to death on the operating table. Your commitment to the struggle always was...total. Reporter :  White House press secretary James Brady is dead. Jim Brady, 40 years old, shot in the head in the attack by what apparently was one of the first bullets fired. Having looked at videotape so many times already, that is the report. And from congressional sources, James Brady has not survived his wounds. [ Children playing in distance ] No time for signals today, I'm afraid. Philip's with Sparrow right now. Good. You need to gather your supplies for Operation Christopher. I've heard so much about you, Elizabeth -- what you've done. I think we'll do great things together. I really wish we didn't have to start this way. I never asked. What are we supposed to call you? Claudia. Claudia. Did  we  do this? I don't think so, but they may try to pin it on us. And we have no idea who's going to seize control of the American government now. I've also heard rumors the Red Army might move into Poland in the next 24 hours. But Operation Christopher? You think this is headed toward guerrilla warfare? Let's hope it doesn't come to that. First, we need you to find out how the president is really doing. We need to know who's in control of the American government. And we need up-to-date intelligence on any efforts to blame us for the assassination attempt. Things are gonna happen fast. The Rezidentura will be worthless, slow, unreliable. We both know it. I can say it. We'll get as much information as we can, start preparations for Christopher immediately. I know I can count on you. I fought behind enemy lines in Stalingrad -- two years. I didn't have any experience, training -- none of what you have. If it happens... you'll do well. [ Engine turns over ] [ Telephones ringing ] [ Indistinct shouting ] The rumors about -- about Jim Brady dying are absolutely untrue. [ Telephone rings ] Hello? Hi. This is Richard Deutsch from the Kennedy Center. I had a few questions come up about the friendship concert. This is not a good day. Well, there are just a few logistical problems we're dealing with here. Richard, I'm sorry. I'm not available for this. Can you discuss tomorrow? I'm sorry. My supervisor said there's a deadline with our schedule. [ Grunting ] [ Breathing heavily ] [ Breathing heavily ] [ Telephone ringing ] [ Echo & The Bunnymen's "Pictures On My Wall" plays ] ♪ Can you hear it? ♪ 
♪ the sound of something burning ♪ 
♪ something changing ♪ 
♪ on the merry-go-round tonight ♪ Hello? Hi. It's Steve. Hi, Steve. What can I do for you? I need the vice president's office -- deputy chiefs of staff. Call back in 15 minutes. I'll set up that line for you. - Thank you. ♪ Are about to swing and fall ♪

Is that what they think? You saw Haig on TV. [ Sighs ] Where are the kids? Beemans. Watching TV. Sandra's there. [ Sighs ] We're gonna need a government car. I'll signal Gregory. [ Door closes ] Reporter :  Looking at the footage again... They keep showing the same thing over and over. What are they supposed to show? I don't know. But there's just something ghoulish about constantly showing this. Ghoulish? I mean, it's not gonna change just because they showed it over and over and over. Oh, my God! Finally, the bullet missed! The president could die, you know. I mean, any one of those guys that got shot could die. Isn't that pretty ghoulish? How are you doing? When do you need it back? Two hours. Tops. [ Keys jingle ] Hey, listen. Don't bring it back dinged, all right? [ Engine turns over ] Reporter :  We continue to receive contradictory and confusing reports about the gunman himself. We know he was subdued at the scene. [ Indistinct conversations ] [ Knock on door ] David. Elizabeth : That's her. [ Engine turns over ] [ Tires screech ] [ Brake grinds ] [ Engine shuts off ] Dana Simon? I'm Justin Nezer. This is Kelly Mainstill. We're deputy chiefs of staff for the vice president's office. We need to talk to you. Oh. Okay. First of all, the vice president would like to personally thank you for everything you did today. I was just... doing my job. Dana, can we talk confidentially? Yes. Of course. We've had our share of political crises, but this one's about as political as a crisis can get. On a day like today, there can be a lot of miscommunication and misinformation, and it's our job to make absolutely certain that the vice president knows what's going on. We're quietly checking with everybody to make sure what we're hearing about the president's condition is true. Yes. Yes. He's okay. He's gonna pull through. Good. Good. We're very relieved to hear that. We're really hoping that we can count on you to keep this meeting confidential. Today's events don't need to be politicized any more than they already have been. I understand. Absolutely. You can reach us here 24 hours a day. They'll get a message to either of us. If anything changes, or if you there's anything you think we should know, please give us a call. Yeah. Here's a pin from the vice president's office. Thank you. Okay. We're on. [ Insects chirping ] [ Sighs ] 7-4-E, 8-3-F, 7-4-2, 7-2-2. F-66. 3-4-2. C-22. 8-3-f, 7-4-2, 14-1-9, 3-42. Hopefully that's that. Let's check the site again. Look, the president is okay. We confirmed it. I don't think, reasonably speaking, that anyone can still believe that someone's gonna take over the government. Can we just check the site? Reporter :  Secretary of State Haig did say he is in control at the White House. Sources have been unable to get an official statement from the vice president as of yet. However, we understand Vice President Bush is going directly to the White House. We need to map our targets. Oh, my God. Can you just stay with me here? Stay with you and what? We're in the middle of a crisis. Yeah, and you don't think Moscow's overreacting just a little? Well, you almost defected a few weeks ago, Philip, so maybe you're not the one to be passing judgment on whether or not Moscow is overreacting. Do you think you could just do what we need to do? Though, of course, we anxiously await word... ...on president Reagan's condition. Constitutionally, gentlemen, you have the president... The line of succession runs through the vice president and speaker of the house. Well, not according to Al "I'm in control here" Haig. It may not be legal, but it reflects a political reality. What? Seizing power? Bush is on a plane. Someone has to step up to the plate. Why don't you two relax? The president's been shot, and your boss is out of control! At least my boss isn't sitting on his ass. You want to get into this right now? Guys, guys, guys! Jesus, sit down. Sit! [ Indistinct conversations ] [ Doorbell rings ] Reporter :  A single bullet that entered just underneath his left arm... Hi. Hey. I'm sorry. Oh, you don't have anything to apologize for. No, I do. I've been thinking. It wasn't just the president who got shot. Yeah? I've been watching it over and over again. The footage of that secret-service agent -- he just turns and puts himself in front of the gun and gets shot. It's horrible. It kind of makes me think about your dad's job. Yeah. I try not to think about it too much, but today was hard. I'm sorry. And I'm sorry about what I said before. My dad doesn't do stuff like that. He's just a travel agent. Travel agenting is more dangerous than you think. Yeah. Planes get delayed. Boats leak. I can't stand it when there's gum stuck to my seat. Travel agenting is a world filled with peril. I'll say. Anything on it? Yeah, it looks like at least an hour. So unless the Weinbergers were fighting, we'll have something to listen to. I got it. 
 
 [ Vehicle approaches ] Neighborhood security. First pass. If Weinberger's car is parked out front, you've got six seconds from front door. If he's blocked by three security guards, I can still make two shots. Let's go map the rest of the targets. He's coming back. I got this. Oh. Hi. I'm -- I'm so glad I found you, officer. I-I've got myself totally turned around. I was trying to get to the Key Bridge, um, get back over the -- I keep making this turn, and then I end up here. I'll be happy to give you directions, but I'm gonna need you to step over to my car first. Oh. Sure. Of course. Um, can -- can you just tell me what this is about? We've had a run of break-ins in the neighborhood. Is there someone in the van with you? Just my husband. Look, we're just trying to get to Washington. I'm sorry for the inconvenience, ma'am. I'm gonna need identification from both of you. Sure. Yes. Of course. I'm gonna need to call this in. The McLean Police are gonna want to swing by just to ask you a few routine questions, take a look inside the van. Oh, God. Is there any way you can do it? No can do. Company policy. Sorry, ma'am, you don't look like a burglar, but we've got to call in on every vehicle parked along the side of the road. It won't take more than 15 minutes, I promise. [ Radio chatter ] [ Engine turns over ] [ Engine turns over ] Well, if there is a war, we might have the first shot... If there is a war, we're not the ones who started it. We just killed a security guard down the street from the secretary of defense. We're riding around with enough explosives to blow up half the government buildings in D.C. We're mapping sniper shots to take out key U.S. leadership. If anyone's escalated things, it's us. I'm not making the decisions. No, but you agree with them. I think the Americans are capable of anything. Do you listen to what they say? What they say about us? Do you listen to  yourself  when you talk about them? What is that supposed to mean? Nothing. Forget it. Are you clean? I hope so. Are you all right? You can't do that! You can't call me at the embassy ever! Everyone is -- it's crazy. Are you trying to get me killed? Is that what you want?! You want to get me killed?! It's gonna be all right. I promise you it's gonna be okay. How do you know? I called you from a line that will trace back to the Kennedy Center. What if you were followed? I wasn't. How do you know? How can you be sure? Because I'm the one who does the following. It's what I do. What do you know about the assassination attempt? I don't know anything. Everyone is freaking out. We're all running around like cut-off chickens. "With their heads cut off." What? The expression is, "Running around like chickens with their heads cut off." You think this is a joke. No, I don't think this is a joke, Nina. Why is the KGB running around like cut-off chickens? Because they're afraid you'll try and stick Hinckley on us. Why would we do that? To justify the coup. What coup? The one your General Haig announced. You're serious. He's one of your top generals, and he's announced he's taking control. What would you call that? No, that's not what happened. Both sides have their fingers on the trigger, and that's how it happens. How it happens? One mistake. That's all it takes. [ Siren wailing in distance ] Hmm. Woman :  I-I don't know... [ Static ] ...coming back or if they even... [ Static ] Security radios, interference. [ Rewinding ] Man :  Can we get some refreshments in here? We're expecting them in about... [ Static ] Great. Now we'll never know what refreshments they served. Weinberger :  Yeah, and they should go on alert or be ready to go on alert. They're not on...alert? [ Static ] The crews who are normally on alert 24 hours a day are moving from the base... [ Static ]  ...Planes, which saves 3 1/2 to 4 minutes if they need to get in the air. The nearest submarine is... [ Static ] ...minutes, 44 seconds off, which is about, uh, two minutes closer than normal. [ Static ] Allen :  Nearest Soviet sub... [ Static ] Cap...minutes, 57 seconds. Man #2 :  How the hell did Haig get...nuclear football? [ Click ] Are you convinced now? No, I'm not. Because it's not clear. He sounded upset. He said, "General Haig get..." And he made a reference to the copy of the briefcase with the missile-launch codes that could authorize a nuclear attack. Yeah. We need to get this to Moscow. Okay, but let's check it out and get some more information first. More infor-- he's getting ready to make a move. Nobody can challenge him if he has the capability to launch America's nuclear arsenal. [ Sighs ] What more do you need, a written manifesto? Is there one available? Philip, please. Philip. Can we please move on this now? He's holding a copy of the nuclear football. We need to transmit. All these years walking these streets, living with these people, you still really don't understand this place. Haig could have 10 nuclear footballs. This still wouldn't be a coup. Really? Yes, really. And if we send that to Moscow, they will go on high alert. And our command control isn't quite state-of-the-art. We will escalate. They will escalate. This thing will spin out of control. So could you please -- can you please just try and get yourself in a different way of looking at it for one minute? You think you understand things so much better than I do. Why? Because you look good in an American suit? What? Because everybody loves talking to you because you think like the kids do? No, that's not what I think -- Because I fit in just fine, but I remember where I came from -- not having all of these things, it being about something bigger than just myself. I remember, too. That doesn't blind me to what's in front of my face. I know how the Americans do things, and Al Haig isn't taking over the government. You don't think they're all about lies and conspiracy like everybody else?! Because they are! Why do you think that they're so different, that they're so pure?! Philip : I don't. But the last two times our leaders died, our government pretended they weren't dead for weeks. Things are different here. Philip. Look, you're the one who keeps saying how dangerous things are and how we're at the edge of war. I say our job is to try and stop that from happening. And you know what we're gonna do for once? We're gonna do it my way. Are you sure? The Soviets have nothing to do with anything. The A.G.'s on the line for you. They want all the division heads on for this conference call. When they get all the division heads at once, it means nothing's happening. Gaad. Yes. Reporter :  Sources at George Washington Hospital tell us that President Reagan came out of surgery... [ Telephones ringing ] Look, if you've got something to say... I'm good. I saw the car. There was glare from the streetlight. I-I couldn't see their faces. I couldn't see the license plate, but I saw the car. Look, you know what, Chris? Next time you get glare kicked back at you, just put it out on the radio. I'll act accordingly. Reporter :  While the president remains in recovery, tensions continue around the world. I spoke earlier with Charles Duluth of Duluth :  Of course, we're all deeply concerned about the president, not just personally, but for the implications of his recovery on the world stage. We are at a dangerous time in human history, and a moment like this can change everything. When Archduke Ferdinand was assassinated, 37 million people were killed in one of the greatest conflagrations of all time -- the First World War. But today, the threat is nuclear. It's billions of lives at stake, not just millions. Hey, dad. When were 37 million people killed? You don't have to worry about that. It's history, which repeats itself, so he does have to worry about it. Reporter :  Cloud cover over Eastern Europe is reportedly preventing American satellites from monitoring Soviet troop movements near Poland. But NATO has said they have no concerns that this will happen, and those reading the tea leaves... Stan's home. Maybe we should go over there and see how they got through the day. Sure. Sandra : Stan? Ohh, what a day, huh? I just -- I can't even believe it. Yeah, how are you guys doing? Come in. Have some wine. Oh, we're good. How are you guys? Uh, are the kids all right? Yeah, I mean, Henry's still so young. I don't think he really even gets it, which is fine. And Paige is a teenager, so, you know, who knows? Well, that's good. I remember with Kennedy, I -- a guy in a sandwich shop told me what had happened, and I-I just jumped in my car and drove to my parents' house. I just -- I just wanted to be home. Yeah. Nothing really felt safe after that. Yeah. Yeah. So, were -- were you involved in this at work? Oh, yeah, yeah, we all were. Right. Thanks. Do you think it's gonna be all right? What do you mean? Just -- I mean, we were just watching the news, and they-- they're talking about war. I mean, how worried do we need to be? Oh, no, no. This is all gonna blow over. I got to, uh, peek at the file of the guy who shot the president -- Hinckley. And he is totally nuts, 100%. Really? Yeah, he actually thought that he was going to impress this movie star, Jodie Foster. But -- I'm sorry, by doing what, shooting the president? Like I said, he's 100% nuts. I mean, certifiably looney. Wow. So you got to investigate him. I thought -- d-didn't -- I thought you worked against spies. Counterintelligence, yeah, but we were worried that the Russians might have been involved, so we had to check that out. Oh, my God. But i-it turns out that they -- they weren't. Which is a good thing because, you know, that, uh... Well, that could have started World War III. Yeah. [ Static ] You all right? Sure. Yeah. [ Sighing ] Oh. Man, it's a hell of a day, huh? Yeah. What is it? What? No, never mind. Feels sort of petty to even think about that kind of thing right now. Think about what? I don't know what you're talking about, Sandra. It's kind of my point. [ Water running ] Okay, I'm feeling like I need a crystal ball for this conversation. [ Sighs ] Okay. Uh... [ Sighs ] You know, I was happy. I was happy when we were in St. Louis. Matthew and I, we made a life for ourselves when you were away. I mean, I had a job. I had friends, like... Matthew liked his school. We were kind of close to my parents, and the only thing that was missing was you. And then your assignment was finally over and [sighs] you're back. Or... some version of you is back. And then we just, you know, suddenly move here and start this whole life and... I thought you wanted me to take this job, to come to D.C. I did. I did, but I thought we were gonna get the chance to get to know each other again, living in the same house. Well, that's what we're doing. Stan. What? You never talk to me. Why is it so hard? I don't know. Just tell me. I was living with psycho militants for too long, okay? I don't know. I don't know how to... How to what? It just doesn't feel like it did before. I'm trying. It's okay. I'm awake. Site was clear. Transmission was good. Radio news was quiet on the way home. Good. [ Sighs ] I, um... I... I just, uh... I'm glad we did it your way this time. [ Sighs ] It all worked out. The center was lucky to have you on the ground today. If Moscow ever finds out we sat on the Haig intelligence, we're finished. I won't tell if you won't.
