 Previously on The Americans... 
 Look what the cat dragged in. - Look at the cat. 
 She came to visit me a month before Paige was born. 
 This is his turf, man. No way we find him. 
 Stop! 
 Out of the way! 
 So, what does some guy in the hood care about a KGB spy? 
 Did something happen between you and Irina? 
 Philip : Nothing happened. 
 I asked you not to lie to me. 
 I made a terrible mistake. 
 Can we try and start over? 
 No. We can't. 
 You're separating? 
 Not exactly. We're, uh-- 
 Hitting the pause button. 
 Can I help you? 
 I'm with the Federal Bureau of Investigation. 
 [ Grunts ] 
 [ Groans ] 
 You find out who took Amador. 
 You find out where he is. 
 Nina? 
 So, you're KGB, right? 
 Yes. 
 You want something to drink? 
 I didn't want this to happen, but it happened. 
 Things just got all crazy, you know? 
 [ Engine shuts off ] 
 [ Sighs ] 
 Don't. 
 What? 
 Replay it in your mind-- what you could, would, or should have done differently. 
 Yeah, well... home sweet home. 
 Doesn't look so bad. 
 [ Scoffs ] Let me know when you want to switch. 
 Philip-- 
 Go home. 
 We both need rest. 
 [ Keys jingle ] 
 [ Engine turns over ] 
 I just spoke to Amador's parents. 
 They're arriving tomorrow. 
 And they're very appreciative of, uh, all of your thoughts. 
 Martha will let you all know details of the funeral services when we have them. 
 So... [ Clears throat ] um, I knew Chris when he started here at CI. 
 He's a-- he was a good agent, good friend, just a good man. 
 I'm sure that you all have your own stories about him. 
 I was a little hard on him sometimes, but he did a lot for this department and for this country. 
 And now here's what we're gonna do for him. 
 We are gonna take every resource we have, every ounce of energy and focus, and we are going to hunt for whoever is responsible for what happened to him. 
 And we are not going to rest until they are behind bars. 
 Or even better, until we zip them up in a body bag. 
 [ Indistinct conversations ] 
 Hey, I'm so sorry. 
 Thank you. 
 He was just... 
 What? 
 Just the other night he was... 
 He was asking me out again. That's all. 
 [ Sniffles ] After he-- that man, he could drive a woman crazy, you know? 
 Yeah, he sure could. 
 He was very fond of you, Martha. 
 Me too. 
 [ Sniffles ] 
 Agent Gaad wants to see you in the vault. 
 [ Sniffles ] Would you excuse me? 
 Anything on the ring? 
 Not yet. Have a seat. 
 Look, it wasn't on his body, and it wasn't in his apartment. 
 He always wore the ring. 
 We're on it. If it's out there, we'll find it. 
 Well, it  is  out there. 
 Sit. 
 Look, I know that the Rezident was the target, but if we don't hit these guys and they start killing at random-- 
 Stan, no one is accusing you of anything. 
 I'm on your side. We're in a war now. 
 It may be a secret war, but it's a war. 
 We have to fight like soldiers now. 
 And you're one of our best. 
 Well, it doesn't feel like it tonight. 
 I don't imagine it does, no. 
 But in a war, blood gets spilled. 
 That's how it goes. 
 So, don't think twice about what you did. 
 Understand? 
 Now go home. Get some rest. 
 I'd rather stay and work the case, if it's all the same to you, sir. 
 The entire Bureau is working the case. 
 If anything breaks, I'll let you know. 
 Tomorrow morning, signal your source and see what the hell she knows about Amador. 
 Now go. That's an order. 
 Yes, sir. 
 [ Knocking on door ] 
 Yeah? 
 Stan : FBI! 
 Open up! 
 You up for a nightcap? 
 Sure. Come on in. 
 How-- how did you know I was here? 
 If I can't find a travel agent staying in a motel under his own name, then I'm in the wrong line of business. 
 Elizabeth told Sandra. 
 Right, right. 
 Well, make yourself comfortable. I'll throw on some sweats. 
 No offense, Phil, but this place is kind of depressing. 
 Philip : Yeah, I know. 
 It's a shithole. 
 Well, it's temporary. 
 Yes, it is. 
 Everything is. 
 Everything's what? 
 Temporary. 
 I'll drink to that. 
 Can I-- can I have one of those? 
 Sure. 
 Cheers. 
 Cheers. 
 You know, I spent a lot of time in shitty motel rooms like this. 
 You know that? 
 I did not. 
 Yeah, before-- before, when I was working undercover. 
 No matter what city I was in, it was pretty much the same room. 
 Lumpy bed, right? 
 Right. 
 Yeah. Too soft. It sags in the middle. 
 Yeah. 
 You would think they would spring for a decent bed. 
 But I guess that's kind of the point, right? 
 No matter where you are, no matter what city or town, you're always in the same place, the same shitty room... here. 
 You got anything salty, pretzels or nuts or something? 
 Uh, no, I-I don't. Sorry. 
 [ Sighs ] 
 [ Sighs ] 
 My partner was found dead tonight. 
 Oh, Jesus. 
 I am... so sorry. 
 Chris Amador. 
 He was a good guy... not like me. 
 He was never married. Maybe that was it. 
 What? 
 He had no secrets, you know? [ Chuckles ] 
 You can't be married and not have secrets... can you, Phil? 
 No, you can't. 
 What happened? 
 He was stabbed. 
 Who did it? 
 Bad guys. 
 We're gonna find them. 
 You okay? 
 Yeah, yeah, I'm-- I'm-- I'm all right. 
 You can stay here if you want. 
 In your lumpy bed. No. No, thank you. 
 I was actually thinking the chair. 
 That's worser. 
 I don't-- I don't see a whole lot of future in my sleep tonight. 
 Why don't I drive you home? 
 No, I'm good. I'm okay. I'm all right. Thank you. 
 Thanks. 
 You know, I mean that sincerely-- thanks. 
 Of course. 
 Sure. 
 Tell me who killed Amador. 
 Who killed Amador? 
 Yeah. 
 Who killed Vlad? 
 I don't know. Don't lie to me. 
 I'm not lying, Nina. Jesus. 
 Vlad was my friend-- my friend! 
 I'm sorry you lost your partner. 
 I am. I lost my friend. 
 This is a really bad day, yes? 
 Yes, it's a very bad day. 
 [ Sighs ] 
 But I-I need to know what happened, Nina. 
 We had no idea what was going on. 
 We don't kill FBI agents. You have to believe. 
 Well, three of my men were killed protecting a scientist two weeks ago. 
 Yes, and-- and that day, I told you-- 
 Arkady was behind closed doors. 
 I told you something was going on. 
 But yesterday-- nothing. 
 Really? Nothing? 
 Nothing, until somebody called, threatening to kill Vlad if something happened to your partner. 
 [ Sighs ] Next thing we know, the police call, saying he's been murdered in a mugging. 
 What are we to think? 
 I don't know who killed Vlad, Nina. 
 If I can find out, I'll let you know. 
 Will you? 
 Yes. We're not monsters, Nina. 
 But I have to know what happened to Amador. 
 Do you understand that? 
 Vlad-- he never wanted to be KGB. 
 He joined to make his uncle happy. 
 He was a colonel for the Red Army and raised Vlad after his father died. 
 He pulled some strings to get him into the door, and Vlad was just getting his guts up to tell him that next year he was joining medical school. 
 He wanted to be doctor. 
 That's all he wanted with his life. 
 I'm sorry. 
 I know you just tell me what I want to hear. 
 That's not true. 
 Listen to me. I know. 
 But if you can, I want you to find out what happened to Vlad, how this happened. 
 Will you do that? 
 I will. 
 I want to be able to tell his family... something. 
 Come on, guys. Clear bowls. Brush teeth. 
 Do I still have to keep cracking the whip like this? 
 Henry, did you pack your homework? 
 I don't know. 
 Well, can you check, please? You guys, come on. 
 I need a little extra hustle from you two getting out the door. 
 You're the one who wanted it this way. 
 Excuse me? 
 Stand up. 
 Do you know what my mother would have done if I talked to her like that? 
 You get to dress how you want, use the phone, watch TV. 
 You do not get to speak to me like that. 
 Are we clear? 
 [ Door closes ] 
 Philip : Hello? 
 Dad-- 
 You and I are not done. 
 Henry : Hi, dad. 
 What are you doing here? 
 Thought I'd take you and Henry to school. 
 Hey, champ. 
 Hey. 
 You think you can get ready lickety-split, hmm? 
 Yeah. [ Smooches ] 
 Go. Go. Go. 
 Okay. 
 Paige : Come on, Henry. 
 I would appreciate it if you didn't make surprise appearances, especially when we are adjusting to new routines. 
 Sure. 
 [ Water running ] 
 Clark had a talk with Martha last night. 
 And? 
 Amador wore a ring. 
 Apparently, it wasn't on his body. 
 We swept the safe house. 
 Yeah, and Gregory's team swept the car. 
 We were all moving pretty fast. 
 Do you have any idea where they ditched it? 
 I'll signal Gregory and have him get into it. 
 The feds are gonna push this as far as they know how. 
 I'll make sure he knows to lay low until we know what's what. 
 Stan came by the motel last night-- drunk mess. 
 What did you find out? 
 [ Sighs ] That his partner was killed. 
 I couldn't exactly work him for leads. 
 You the one who wanted to be his friend, right, because of what a great potential source he could be? 
 Okay. 
 Call next time, all right? 
 I don't need permission to see my kids. - Fine. Stay. 
 [ Water stops ] Clean the kitchen while you're at it. 
 [ Chuckles ] 
 Paige! Henry! 
 Ready? Let's go. 
 Yeah. - Yeah. 
 [ Indistinct conversations ] 
 [ Drawer opens ] 
 [ Sniffs ] 
 [ Chuckles ] Gaad: Hold that smile, Beeman. 
 We got a hit on his ring. 
 How? 
 J. Edgar's genius-- manpower. 
 Put every available agent in the field, double up on local uniforms, soon enough you get a hit. 
 Where did they find it? 
 The owner of a salvage yard tried to fence it at a pawn shop in Kingman Park. 
 Salvage yard? 
 It must be where they dumped the car used to move Amador. 
 But we got to it before they crushed it. 
 Doherty and MacMillan are gonna go down there now. 
 I'm going. I'm going, sir. 
 Yeah, but I want you to go with them. 
 I don't want you flying solo on this. 
 [ Door creaks ] 
 [ Coin drops ] 
 [ Telephone rings ] 
 Hello? 
 [ Tapping ] 
 [ Receiver clicks ] 
 [ Jazz music playing ] 
 The ring you tried to pawn this morning belonged to a federal agent. 
 Look, I don't ask questions, and sometimes people leave things. 
 It's a fair trade. 
 Well, in this case the federal agent in question was murdered, so I'm gonna ask questions, and you're gonna answer them. 
 Sound okay? 
 Yeah. 
 Good. 
 Who delivered the car and when? 
 It was left here last night. 
 I didn't see anyone. 
 They just left it? 
 Some people do. 
 They know that I sell the metal-- 
 Uh-huh. And the ring was in the trunk? 
 You got the keys? Hmm? 
 It was shoved right up there. 
 So, a car just shows up in the middle of the night, no plates, trunk stripped of carpeting where you find a ring, and your first move is a pawn shop? 
 Vin numbers are filed off. 
 With the vin numbers filed off? 
 [ Groans ] 
 Doherty. 
 Ring was shoved up here. 
 What, you think it fell off? 
 No. He left it for us. 
 Just give me a minute here, would you? 
 MacMillan. 
 I want to ask you again. 
 Who dropped off this car? 
 Look, like I already told you-- 
 Ugh! 
 [ Grunting ] 
 You listen to me, you piece of sh1t. 
 You may think you know what I am or what I will and won't do in this situation, but you have no idea. [ Groans ] 
 Now, I don't believe someone who just murdered a federal agent would dump their car in some random salvage yard. 
 So, I want you to tell me everything you know about this. 
 Do you understand? 
 There's some black guys. They're drug dealers, I think. 
 They dump cars with me sometimes. 
 They came by late last night. 
 I don't know names. I swear to God. 
 See, that wasn't so bad, was it? 
 You and I are gonna go look at some mug books together. 
 [ Mid-tempo music plays ] 
 Lloyd, have another? 
 
 
 
 ♪ I've been watching you ♪ 
 Hey. 
 How bad is it? 
 We don't know. 
 The guy may have left his ring behind in the trunk. 
 Damn. 
 Yeah. 
 We'll let you know what we know. 
 You just keep safe and out of sight till this thing goes away. 
 You okay? 
 Not really. [ Chuckles ] 
 Philip is, uh, staying in a hotel. 
 The kids aren't so good. 
 sh1t. Elizabeth. 
 [ Chuckles ] You told me so, huh? 
 Why are you telling me this? 
 I don't know. 
 Who else can I tell, you know? 
 Yeah. 
 No, I can't. I'm [Scoffs] a mess right now. 
 You'll be okay. 
 [ Scoffs ] 
 We all will be, you included. 
 This thing is gonna blow over. 
 We're just trying to get ahead of it. 
 And if it doesn't blow over? 
 Let's not cross that bridge unless we have to. 
 In the meantime, you just stay out of sight and check your signals. 
 I'll be waiting. 
 I swear I'm not trying to make any trouble. 
 But they always wore hats and jewelry like they wear. 
 These guys all look the-- 
 Don't even say that. 
 Son of a bitch. 
 Beeman. 
 [ Indistinct conversations ] 
 I think we got him. 
 Who? 
 I-I-I don't know. 
 The guy who killed Chris, the-- the Russians, the whole damn thing, maybe. 
 You want to sit down? - The guy from the salvage yard who hocked the ring, and he does business with some riffraff from the projects. 
 They're the ones who brought him the car. 
 He says he's got no names, he can't ID them 'cause they're always wearing hats, but then he pulls a face at one of the mug shots, and here we go. 
 I've seen him before, in Philly. 
 Okay. That I wasn't expecting. 
 Chris and I are at the site where we lost Joyce Ramirez. 
 The wife of the dead Directorate "S" officer? 
 Exactly, and that same guy is there. 
 I notice him, which I would have forgotten, except an hour later he's at the trucking company where we're following a lead. 
 He followed you? 
 Only explanation I can make sense of. 
 Didn't you grab him? 
 He was a little fast for me. 
 Figures. 
 Now I know him. 
 [ Door creaks ] 
 [ Whistle blowing ] 
 sh1t! Go! Go! Go! Go! 
 [ Indistinct shouting, woman screaming ] 
 Curtis! Curtis! 
 Don't shoot! 
 Aah! Don't shoot! 
 [ Screams ] Curtis! 
 Curtis! 
 Don't shoot! 
 Out front! Out front! 
 [ Shouting continues ] 
 [ Sirens wailing ] 
 [ Tires screech ] 
 [ Groaning ] 
 Get on your knees! On your knees! 
 Hands on your head! 
 [ Breathing heavily ] 
 Bring him up. 
 Curtis, right? 
 Should have let me catch you the first time. 
 I'm upset now. 
 [ Indistinct shouting ] 
 [ Breathing heavily ] 
 The FBI picked up a member of Gregory's team. 
 So we won't be skating our way out of this one. 
 No. 
 [ Sighs ] 
 How long ago did he contact you? 
 Hour and a half. 
 Signal him back. 
 Put him in a safe house. 
 I'll get the exfiltration plan going as soon as possible. 
 They'll be watching him. 
 We'll have to be careful, but nothing we haven't done before. 
 His team? 
 Money cached, contingency plans. 
 They all know to disappear or expect heavy jail time for drug dealing. 
 [ Sighs ] What about him? 
 What  about  him? 
 Stub this out, will you? 
 [ Sighs ] 
 Will he set off into the night gently? 
 Moscow can be a frightening prospect for someone who hasn't seen the world. 
 He's devoted to the cause. I think he'll like it there. 
 Do you agree, Philip? 
 I'm not so sure. 
 Tell him the truth-- nice apartment, regular stipend, but he won't be rich. 
 Language lessons for as long as he needs them. 
 They'll call him in to lecture the cadets, but he won't have an office at Dzerzhinsky. 
 It's a hard adjustment, but after the first few years he'll be fine. 
 I'll tell him. 
 You need to make sure he's actually planning to come. 
 His options have narrowed by quite a lot, and one of them is turning on us. 
 He has always been completely loyal. 
 He's never really been tested. - He grew up here and turned on his own nation. 
 That's harder than anything any of us have ever done. 
 Well, now he's facing life in a cage or a thousand volts running through his body. 
 Talk him into Moscow. 
 If you can't, you take the only other option available... as sad as we would be to see it go that direction. 
 [ Engine turns over ] 
 You know, I only have one real question for you, Curtis, which is-- do you have any idea what it is that you've been doing? 
 'Cause if you do know, then, uh, keep your mouth shut. 
 That's how bad it is. 
 But if you don't know, if you've somehow kind of been tricked into this, well... you might want to speak up. 
 You've been arrested twice-- minor drug raps. 
 I work in Counterintelligence. 
 Do you know what that is? 
 I'm not saying anything to you. 
 I chase spies... KGB. 
 You ever heard of them? 
 That's the Russians. 
 You know what I don't care about? 
 Drugs. I-I couldn't care less. 
 I may look dumb, but I'm not. 
 You don't look dumb. 
 Cops got all kinds of tricks. 
 You know, my partner was killed two nights ago. 
 I'm way past tricks, Curtis. 
 His name was Chris Amador. 
 And he was stabbed. 
 I don't know what to do. 
 I... feel... like revenge, you know? 
 But who-- who really cares? 
 I mean, what does that get me? 
 But these Russians that I'm talking about-- 
 I'm pretty sure they're the ones who killed him. 
 So, I'm not tricking you, Curtis. 
 If you're working for the Russians and you know it, you wait for your lawyer 'cause you've committed treason. 
 But, see, I don't think you do know. 
 You and I don't have much in common. 
 No sh1t. 
 But we're both goddamn Americans, right? 
 Right? 
 [ Engine shuts off ] 
 [ Sighs ] 
 Well... 
 Well... 
 We always knew this day could come. 
 You said. 
 The world is a shitty place, Gregory. 
 That's what I really think. 
 We agree. 
 I want to focus on now. 
 'Cause, like we always talked about, there are plans put in place to help you, to take care of you. 
 And right now those plans are being put in motion. 
 I do not know the details, but I guess we will probably take you cross-country by car-- 
 Moscow, Elizabeth? 
 I mean, can you really see me there? 
 I want to talk to you about it because I can. 
 There would be an adjustment period-- 
 Get me to LA, okay? 
 It's a lot closer. Fresh start in Compton. 
 I can change my identity, my name. 
 Gregory, this is bad. The FBI are after you. 
 Maybe I can do a little work on my face, you know? 
 I mean, if you can stand it. 
 You guys are the masters of disguise. 
 I don't think they're gonna go for it. 
 If you ask them, they'll do anything for you. 
 Gregory. Gregory, please, let's just talk about this. 
 Let's just get out of here, you and me. 
 I can't. I got to-- I... 
 Gaad : Gregory Thomas. 
 His last known political activity was a protest march on Memphis City Hall with Martin Luther King in march of '68. 
 Now, we all know the KGB tried to infiltrate the Civil Rights Movement. 
 America's oppressed minorities were rising up already, so why not get in on the action? 
 But the question is, did they go so far as to recruit any civil rights activists? 
 [ Knock on door ] 
 Philip and Elizabeth said you'd be expecting me. 
 Hmm. 
 [ Lock clicks ] 
 Claudia. 
 Gregory. 
 Means a lot meet you, Gregory. 
 Please, let's-- let's sit. 
 We have to move quickly, but we want to make sure we're doing everything we can to make this as easy as possible for you. 
 I understand why you want to go to California instead of Moscow, of course. 
 I wish with all my heart we could make that happen. 
 We'd do it for you, Gregory, in an instant. 
 We'd spend anything, move any mountain. 
 But it just wouldn't work-- new documents, new history, even a new face. 
 With what's at stake, I'm afraid it wouldn't be enough to put off the FBI. 
 You're more scared of them than I am, and I'm the one willing to take the risk. 
 The problem is, the risk isn't just yours. 
 It's Philip and Elizabeth's, too. 
 I would never, ever betray them. 
 I don't think you would. 
 But do you know why I'm the best at my job? 
 I'm a guard dog. 
 I don't take any chances with the people I protect. 
 That's why they send me-- an old lady-- halfway around the world to do this. 
 Now, you've been brilliant, a hero, and your reward is waiting. 
 If you have any last thought to run to California, please understand that the FBI will follow you to the ends of the Earth. 
 We put evidence in your apartment linking you to the murder of the FBI agent who was bleeding in the trunk of the car your people disposed of, trace amounts of bloody fibers from his suit recovered in the safe house. 
 When the trail stops at your doorstep, we won't have to worry about them following it any further and getting to Philip and Elizabeth. 
 It's your final act of service. 
 [ Laughs ] 
 Whew. 
 You guys don't mess around, do you? 
 No. We don't. 
 [ Sighs ] 
 I... 
 I won't take to Moscow. 
 It takes time, but others have done it. 
 You'll like it eventually. 
 I have never... wanted too much, really. 
 I just wanted to live for something, and I've done that. 
 Okay. 
 And to know when I'm done. 
 Now I'm done. 
 [ Door opens ] 
 You tell him how lovely Moscow is in the spring? 
 [ Sighs ] 
 Some people just aren't cut out for a foreign travel. 
 You think he's negotiating, trying to soften you up for California? 
 I think he's trying to get away from us. 
 Or he's fooling himself. I don't really know. 
 But we need to get him to Moscow, Philip. 
 And if he won't go? 
 He was Elizabeth's first recruit, her agent. 
 I've had my differences with her, but if this ends the hard way, I don't want her to have to do it. 
 You'll be there? 
 Of course. 
 So, we know who killed Chris. 
 Oh, God. Thank God. 
 Yeah. Don't have him yet. 
 But you will, right? 
 Yeah, I think so. I think we will. 
 Good. That's good. 
 Yeah. 
 [ Clears throat ] 
 [ Ring clinks ] 
 You know... most agents never actually pull the trigger. 
 But that hasn't been my destiny. 
 I know. 
 Well, you don't know everything, Sandra. 
 I've protected you from things. 
 I never asked for that. I didn't ask for protection. 
 Well, if you want to have a family, be in a family, that's what you do, right? 
 Did something else happen? Is it-- 
 It's just... the world that we live in is a little darker and a little uglier than I think you know. 
 Okay. 
 So, sometimes... 
 What? 
 Stan... we could just get out. We could just leave. 
 I mean, I don't even care where we go. 
 We could live in a shack, and I wouldn't care. 
 You and me and Matthew-- that is all that matters. 
 We could leave everything else behind. 
 [ Voice breaking ] Please. 
 [ Both laugh ] 
 They got Chinese in Moscow? 
 See? That's one problem. 
 [ Sighs ] 
 Your friend Claudia-- she stepped between me and that door. 
 She really think she can stop me if I wanted to walk out? 
 You'd be surprised. 
 [ Laughs ] That's funny. 
 [ Chuckles ] 
 Russian girls. You're all tough, huh? 
 I guess we had to be. 
 Mm-hmm. 
 That's why I fell for you. 
 'Cause I'm a tough girl? 
 'Cause you're committed... uncompromising, and stubborn. 
 You like all that? 
 Don't take him back. 
 Find somebody else. 
 He's gonna soften you all up. 
 [ Sighs ] Gregory-- 
 Hey. 
 Find somebody that will love you for being so strong. 
 [ Breathing heavily ] 
 I'm not going with you, Elizabeth. 
 There's nowhere else to go. 
 You know they put the FBI agent's murder on me. 
 I had nothing to do with that. 
 It was a smart thing to do. 
 You know, the FBI-- they're gonna keep going on this thing until they get someone. 
 So, you're-- you're what? 
 I'm gonna walk out that door, find some men with guns, put an end to this hunt so you can keep doing the job that you were sent here to do. 
 Gregory, nobody wants that.  I  don't want that. 
 You've been faithful to the cause for years. 
 We want to reward you. 
 This  is  my reward. 
 [ Sighs ] You're being stupid. 
 We have a whole new life for you. 
 [ Zipper closes ] 
 I don't want a new life. 
 Hey, you don't know how good things can be. 
 Moscow is beautiful. 
 It's Cosmopolitan, much more so than Washington. 
 There is art. There-- it's-- there's culture. 
 You're a travel brochure. 
 Listen, people would be in awe of you, the way you have lived, what you have done. 
 You know me, okay? 
 I lived here. I fought here. 
 They're not gonna let you stay. They can't. 
 They can't risk that, that you could change your mind, that something could go wrong. 
 You trust me. I ain't changing my mind. 
 I trust you. 
 But you know I can't let you. 
 It ain't up to you, Elizabeth. 
 I can't! Gregory, please. 
 You can. 
 Please. 
 Goodbye, Elizabeth. 
 Gregory... [ Door opens ] 
 Look who's here. 
 He won't come. 
 He wants to find some cops to shoot him. 
 He thinks that'll end things for us. 
 For  us? 
 True to the end. 
 Come on, Gregory. 
 Look, you people owe me this much. 
 Wait outside, Elizabeth. 
 Gregory, please. 
 I'm done talking. 
 Elizabeth, wait outside. 
 No. 
 You don't have to do this. 
 [ Breathing shakily ]

 He'll do what he says. 
 I think that would be a mistake. 
 We owe him this. He's right. 
 And I know him. 
 He's always done everything he said he'd do. 
 That's who he is. 
 Please, Philip. 
 I'm asking you. Please.
