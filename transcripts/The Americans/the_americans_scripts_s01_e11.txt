 Thank you for getting a place for us to meet. 
 Why is it so hard? It just doesn't feel like it did before. 
 If we start killing scientists on U.S. soil... who knows where it leads? 
 What the hell did you think you were doing? 
 They got my partner. 
 What would you have done? 
 Who killed Vlad? 
 I don't know. Don't lie to me. 
 You're separating? Not exactly. We're, uh -- 
 Hitting the pause button. 
 Home, sweet home. 
 General Zhukov. 
 Our war is not so cold anymore, Elizabeth. 
 Our enemy is strong and capable. 
 Gaad : They kill us, we kill them. 
 It's the world we live in. 
 But even in this world, there are lines that can't be crossed. 
 At this moment, three high-level KGB officers are being targeted in Moscow, including Viktor Zhukov, head of Directorate "S." 
 [ Doorbell rings ] 
 There will be no sanctuary, no safety, not even in their own homes. 
 [ Thud ] 
 We're going to find them, and we're going to kill them. 
 This isn't a cold war. 
 There's nothing cold about the covert, violent exchanges between the United States and the Soviet Union. 
 They've killed not only our agents, but our citizens. 
 And for that, they'll pay. 
 [ Grunts ] 
 [ Gunshot ] 
 [ Gunshot ] 
 [ Both grunting ] 
 [ Silenced gunshot ] 
 [ Silenced gunshot ] 
 Wow. 
 No. Stop. 
 No, really. Wow. You look amazing. 
 Well, I have more paint on my face than a new Buick, so... 
 [ Laughs ] Come on. Let's go. 
 Okay. 
 [ Up-tempo music plays ] 
 What is this Harvey Wallbanger? 
 Vodka, Galliano, and orange juice. 
 Galliano. That sounds so continental. 
 This is my Italian lover, Galliano. 
 [ Both laugh ] 
 [ Sighs ] 
 Have you ever dated anyone from a foreign country? 
 Never. You? 
 Mm. Yeah. In college. 
 There was this visiting professor, Juhani, from Finland. 
 He was the first guy I ever slept with on a list of two. 
 I hope Juhani's life is happier than Stan's. 
 That was the Harvey Wallbanger talking. 
 Sorry. [ Chuckles ] 
 Speaking of -- excuse me. Can we get two more of these? 
 Bartender : You got it. 
 Thank you. 
 Have you ever thought about cheating? 
 Wow. 
 Um... 
 I mean, I think anyone who's married and says they haven't is lying. 
 Mm. 
 But there is a difference between thinking about it and actually going through. 
 Is something going on, Sandra? 
 No. Oh, I'm sorry. 
 I'm just blah, blah, blah, blah. 
 [ Chuckles ] 
 Let's go dance. 
 [ Chuckling ] What? 
 Narrator :  As is the case with most mammals, the cheetah... 
 What does this have to do with insurance? 
 The insurance company pays for the show. 
 Why? 
 Well, that's what capitalism's all about. 
 You make something, then you sell it for profit. 
 How do you make insurance? 
 You  buy  insurance, doofus. 
 Do we buy their insurance? 
 No. We just watch their show. 
 I'm hungry. 
 Me too. 
 Well, I have orange juice and...peanut butter. 
 The orange juice is warm. 
 What do you do for food? 
 [ British accent ] The Jennings family are natural foragers. 
 They find comestibles -- Comestibles? 
 Food wherever it can be found. 
 [ Snorting ] No! Aah!

 Matthew : Hello? 
 Oh, h-hi. 
 I thought you were at the "Rocky Horror" show. 
 Doesn't start till midnight. 
 Oh. And Mrs. Peters is driving you and Harry? 
 Yes, mom. 
 Could you, uh, put dad on the phone for me, please? 
 He called to say he's working late. 
 Shocker, right? 
 Okay, well, have a good time, then. 
 Okay? 
 Who wants Skittles? 
 Me. And Cheetos. 
 Can I have a Mars bar? 
 No, they're out of Mars bars. 
 Hey, look over there. 
 What's he doing? 
 Taking a whiz. 
 [ Whistles ] Hey, buddy, you want to pack it up? 
 [ Chuckles ] 
 Nice one, dad. Let's go. 
 [ Both chuckle ] 
 [ Sniffles ] 
 [ Door opens, closes ] 
 [ Sniffles ] 
 [ Sniffles ] 
 Hey. 
 What happened? 
 [ Sighs, sniffles ] 
 I've been asking you that for months. 
 I'm still waiting for an answer that doesn't [sighs] smell like bullshit. 
 Okay. 
 Seems like you've had a few drinks, hon. 
 I called headquarters. 
 They said that you left hours ago. 
 Well, they were mistaken. 
 Bullshit. 
 Look, Sandra, whatever it is you're thinking, I'm...telling you you don't understand. 
 [ Scoffs ] 
 You're a goddamn liar. 
 Can we just take a breath here for a second? 
 [ Sniffles ] 
 [ Laughs ] 
 You know, every time that I call headquarters, it's so funny, because they say that you left four hours ago, and I keep telling myself, "Oh, yeah, he must be out on a stakeout," or, "Oh, he must be out on a case," or, "Oh, he must be surveilling some bad guys or something." 
 But you know what? There aren't enough bad guys in the world to explain all your time away from here, from us, from me. 
 And it dawned on me! 
 I was like, "Wake up, Sandra!" Because you know what? 
 The only bad guy here is you, Stan, and the opposite of the man that I married and a coward, and I am pretty sure that I can't stand the sight of you right now! 
 Sandra, please -- can you please -- 
 Stop! You know what? What goes on in you? 
 What goes on in there, huh?! Sandra -- 
 Do you know? Do you have any idea? 
 No, you don't. You don't. 
 'Cause there's nothing. There's nothing there. 
 Just nothing. 
 I just need you to listen to me. 
 No. 
 Because I am sick [sighs] of kidding myself about you and about this marriage and about the last 19 1/2 years of my life, and I am -- I don't know how you can dare turn my life into some... 
 [ Sobs ] 
 [ Door opens, closes ] 
 Zhukov is dead? 
 Monsters is what they are. 
 Assassins with federal I.D. badges. 
 [ Birds chirping ] 
 Who did it? 
 I'm told the CIA Director of Planning for the Soviet Union, Richard Patterson, was the architect of the operation. 
 He has to die. 
 Not by us. I'm sorry to say there'll be no retribution. 
 Moscow's decided to end the escalation of violence for now. 
 So he gets to walk off free? 
 Moscow says that we can't let this spiral any further out of control. 
 We have to stay focused on the big -- 
 Moscow is wrong. 
 Do you agree with the centre's perspective? 
 I do not agree or disagree. 
 I follow orders. 
 Speaking of which, you and Philip directly contradicted my order regarding Gregory Thomas. 
 It was the right thing to do. 
 Defying orders is never the right thing to do. 
 You're lucky that your act of street theater didn't bring down the entire operation. 
 Sometimes the smartest officers do the stupidest things. 
 We're sorry. 
 Viktor Zhukov was a great man who meant a great deal to you. 
 I know he'd have full confidence you'll do the right thing. 
 I thought the Americans understood that even covert wars have rules. 
 I was wrong. 
 [ Liquid pouring ] 
 You wanted to see me, Colonel? 
 Sit. 
 How is the training going? 
 Good. 
 Any problems? 
 No. 
 Change is hard, daunting. 
 It uproots us. 
 Have I failed in some respect, sir? 
 No. You are exemplary. 
 But I see that you are unhappy. 
 Things are not as you expected? 
 No. 
 Philip is a good man. 
 You are a good match. 
 [ Speaking Russian ] 
 Nine years ago, fate or circumstance brought Malysh and me together. 
 And my life has never been the same. 
 Malysh has taught me what it means to love. 
 Do you know what love is, Elizabeth? 
 It's a feeling. Yes. 
 The most profound feeling. 
 He isn't particularly smart, or he isn't pretty. 
 But I love him. 
 Do you know why? 
 Because I take care of him every day. 
 And he, in his way, is taking care of me. 
 If you take care of something, Elizabeth, one day you will discover that you love this creature and your life would be empty without him. 
 Zhukov was murdered. 
 What? 
 The Americans killed him. 
 I'm going to find the man responsible and kill him. 
 Are those our orders? 
 Zhukov understood me. 
 He loved me. 
 I'm telling you, the man who ordered his murder will pay with his life. 
 Elizabeth, come on. You can't -- 
 No,  they  can't, Philip. 
 And I'm gonna make sure they know it. 
 Patterson keeps an irregular schedule. 
 He takes a number of different routes to Langley. 
 Sometimes stops off to get a coffee or a doughnut, but not always. 
 He arrives at the office by 7:00ish, doesn't leave for meals. 
 His dry-cleaners is next to a bank with a security guard. 
 His gym has exterior video surveillance. 
 Don't ask me why. 
 He frequents the Wheel House on Comstock. 
 He always goes by himself, but often leaves in the company of a woman, rarely the same one. 
 Patterson is tough to get. 
 You have to let this go. 
 I can't do that. 
 Patterson is a careful man, but he has one weakness. 
 He likes women. 
 Not for the long haul -- for a pit stop. 
 He can be reckless. 
 Interesting word. 
 My best shot to grab him is at the Wheel House. 
 "Grab"? You've got to be out of your mind. 
 It's doable. No, it's not. It's reckless. 
 If you're saying I can't do it alone, you're right. 
 Look, all I -- No. 
 Philip -- We just did this. 
 I know. I know we did. 
 We just got done defying orders. 
 This is different, and you know it. 
 You want to kill him? 
 Put a scope on a rifle. Take him out. 
 That's the point. I can't. 
 His movements are unpredictable. That's bullshit. 
 You're putting yourself in danger because you've made it personal. 
 Do you see that? 
 If you're asking me do I want to look in Patterson's eyes before I kill him, the answer is yes. 
 [ Door opens ] 
 Matthew : Hello? 
 [ Door closes ] 
 Stan : Hey. 
 Hey. Where's mom? 
 Aerobics class, I think. 
 How was the "Rocky Horror" movie? 
 It was fun. 
 We threw toilet paper and toast at the screen. 
 Y-you did what? 
 Never mind. 
 Matthew. 
 Are you wearing makeup? 
 Yeah, dad. 
 It's a drag show. Everyone wears makeup. 
 And, no, that doesn't mean I'm gay. 
 [ Chuckles ] 
 [ Door closes ] 
 [ Door opens, closes ] 
 What was so urgent? 
 Mom, daddy, I'd like you to meet Clark. 
 Hi. [ Chuckles ] 
 Bill : Hi, there. 
 Elaine : Hi. 
 [ Chuckles ] 
 To quote Tevye from "Fiddler on the Roof," to life. 
 Oh! To life. 
 [ Glasses clinking ] 
 To life. 
 [ Chuckles ] They saw the show last night. 
 Oh, loved it. Mm. 
 Bill : "If I Were a Rich Man" was in perfect pitch, but I thought Tevye was a little flat with "Tradition." 
 Daddy is a baritone in the church choir. 
 We're Lutherans. Right. 
 How were you raised, Clark? 
 Uh...Protestant. Presbyterian. 
 Yeah, that's not so far off, hm? 
 So, would anyone like coffee? 
 I would. Oh, let me. 
 No, no. You stay. Talk. 
 We've heard so much about you, Clark. 
 Really? 
 Don't worry. Nothing about work. 
 Martha keeps saying what a wonderful guy you are. 
 We've never seen her so happy. 
 Daddy. What?! 
 You said he's a great guy. 
 She's over the moon for you. 
 Well, your daughter is a very special lady, and I am so sorry to say, but I really need to get going. 
 That's okay. 
 Oh, no. 
 Yeah, it's just -- it's just work stuff that can't wait. 
 But it was a real pleasure meeting you both. 
 It was great to meet you, too, Clark. 
 I hope to see you soon. 
 I'm sure we will. 
 Take care. 
 Bye-bye. Bye. 
 Okay, before you say anything, I know. 
 I know no one's supposed to know about you, but they could just tell that I was seeing someone, and then, of course, they wanted to meet you and -- 
 Martha, your parents are lovely. 
 Like you. 
 Mm. 
 Bye. 
 [ Sighs ] 
 Bye. 
 I'm pregnant -- number two. 
 Congratulations. 
 Mm. 
 How old is your daughter now? 
 3. 
 She's in a play group. 
 There are no demands on children in America, no chores. 
 All we do all day long is watch them play. 
 Play is serious. [ Chuckles ] 
 It's how we learn to read one another... 
 Oh. 
 ...and the world. 
 I don't remember much of that as a child. 
 Because of the war, you never had the pleasure of play. 
 Things were hard. 
 Very hard. 
 Philip must be excited about your family growing. 
 I haven't told him. 
 I will, of course. 
 Just not yet. 
 In case you change your mind. 
 You remember my dog, Malysh? 
 Mm-hmm. 
 He died. 
 I'm sorry. 
 I know you loved him. 
 He was my companion. 
 We all die alone, Elizabeth. 
 Before that, we make choices. 
 
 
 
 [ Car door opens ] 
 [ Sighs ] 
 I'll give you 20 minutes, then I'll pull the car in the alley in the back. 
 20 minutes. 
 It's not too late. You can still turn back. 
 We both know that's not true. 
 But you can. 
 [ Scoffs ] 
 20 minutes. 
 Good luck.

 You surprised me with Townshend. 
 Do I look like an Air Supply guy?

 So... 
 [ Clears throat ] 
 Vlad. 
 Tell me the story of who murdered Vlad. 
 I...keep hitting a brick wall. 
 Nobody's talking. 
 Maybe you're talking to the wrong people. 
 Maybe that's what I'll find out. 
 I have a lot more access to the truth now. 
 Look, Nina, the Rezidentura was warned. 
 You had an opportunity to make an exchange, and you didn't do it. 
 I don't know what to tell you. 
 The... 
 I-I don't... 
 I don't think we're ever gonna really know what happened, Nina. 
 It... 
 It's frustrating. 
 I would use a different word. 
 What is it you want from me? 
 Well, I've been thinking that this part of things... should stop. 
 Is that what you want? 
 It's not what I... 
 It's the right thing to do. 
 Okay. 
 I don't have anything anymore, Stan. 
 No country to go back to. 
 My family, I will never see again. 
 I only have fear... and you. 
 My wife... 
 She knows. 
 Yes. 
 Family is everything. 
 Are you there? 
 Elizabeth : I'm here. 
 Who are you? What do you want? 
 What do you hear, Richard? 
 What do I hear? Yes. 
 Your footsteps. 
 Yes, but what do you  hear? 
 I don't understand. 
 Listen. 
 Do you hear that? 
 Your chest ring and falling. 
 Your pulse quickening. 
 Your heart beating. 
 How does it feel to be alive... but know that you're going to die? 
 You just don't know exactly when. 
 Everyone dies. 
 That's true. 
 But you're fortunate. 
 You know what's coming. 
 But you won't get any goodbyes. 
 It will just happen, just like it did for the people you slaughtered in Moscow. 
 Do you want information? No. 
 Money? 
 No. 
 What do you want? 
 I want to know how it feels, how  you  feel. 
 I want to know how it feels to order the deaths of innocent people. 
 Those generals who died in Moscow weren't innocent. 
 They knew the risks. 
 Like you. 
 And you. 
 Do you know who I am? 
 Richard Patterson, CIA, Director of Operations and Planning for the Soviet Union. 
 That is my title. But do you know who I am? 
 I'm a bureaucrat. 
 I decide nothing. I do nothing. 
 You give orders. 
 I give orders that are given to me. 
 I implement the will of others. 
 But you -- your life is a lie. 
 You kill. That's who you are. 
 That's what you know. That's what you do. 
 You should stop. 
 You grind people into dust. 
 You have no heart, no soul, no conscience. 
 You should stop talking right now. 
 Your hands are covered in blood. 
 Do you care about anything? 
 Do you love anyone? 
 Does anyone love you? I said stop talking! 
 [ Footsteps departing ] 
 [ Door slams ] 
 [ Gasping ] 
 [ Crying ] 
 Oh, God. 
 What happened? 
 What happened? 
 [ Sighs, sniffles ] 
 It's okay. I'll do it. I'll do it. 
 No. 
 I thought this was what you wanted. 
 It's not him. It's not about him. 
 I don't care about him. 
 About Zhukov? 
 I was out of control. 
 [ Continues crying ] 
 It's okay. 
 It's okay. 
 It happens. 
 [ Door opens, closes ] 
 [ Birds chirping ] 
 Gaad : And they took you where? 
 It was a warehouse, I think. 
 It was industrial. 
 Kendall : How do you know? 
 The sound of her footsteps, the way her voice carried. 
 It was large, empty. 
 She was alone in the warehouse. 
 No. 
 The man was with her? Yes. 
 The same man? 
 I think so. Yes. 
 What were you doing in the restroom? 
 I was going to have s*x with her. 
 And she attacked you. 
 Yes. 
 And she had help. 
 Yes. 
 And she said she was gonna kill you. 
 Yes. 
 Because of the deaths of the KGB agents in Moscow. 
 I think so. 
 You  think. 
 It was personal -- killing me. 
 How do you know? 
 By the sound of her voice. 
 Assuming she was a KGB agent and she brought you to a safe house to kill you, why do you think she let you go? 
 I don't know. 
 So, a woman and a man. 
 Yes. 
 A couple. 
 I love to come here this time of year. 
 Everything is in the process of becoming. 
 Elizabeth : The garden is beautiful. 
 The flowers will be temporary. 
 We will have to enjoy them while we can. 
 Mm. 
 How are you and Philip? 
 The same. 
 Do you know why you were chosen for America? 
 Because of my commitment. 
 Yes. 
 Loyalty, intelligence, skills. 
 But most of all, you were chosen because of your fear. 
 My fear? 
 Of surrender. 
 Surrender for you would be an act of suicide. 
 Hm. 
 But not everyone is your enemy. 
 These buds don't look like much now. 
 But in a week or two, the garden will be bursting with color. 
 Nature is genius... and easy to overlook. 
 I have no more stories to tell you, Elizabeth. 
 I lost my way a long time ago. 
 I have lived for my work, for the party. 
 Now I miss what I never had. 
 What's up? 
 I wanted to say thanks... a lot. 
 You didn't have to drive all the way out here. 
 I did, though. 
 I-I brought beer. 
 "Thanks a lot" beer? 
 [ Door closes ] 
 Do you, um, have an opener? 
 [ Cap clatters ] 
 Oh. 
 [ Chuckles ] 
 Just like old times. 
 [ Cap clatters ] 
 At least I stopped using my teeth. 
 [ Chuckles ] 
 This place is, um... 
 Homey? 
 You going somewhere? 
 I can't stay here anymore. 
 I don't want to bring the kids here again. 
 Right. 
 It was fun for a night or two, but they need to feel -- 
 Rooted. 
 I completely -- I -- [ Sighs ] 
 No, I think it's been long enough, and... it's the right thing to do. 
 Actually, you think, um, I could take you back to the house and borrow the car to move my bags? 
 Because my -- my battery's dead. 
 Yeah, your bags will fit in the car, and you could just deal with the battery tomorrow. 
 Oh, you want to see it? 
 See it? 
 The apartment. 
 Oh, you got an apartment. 
 So, do you want to see it? 
 No, I'm -- you should definitely take the car, and I should, um... 
 I'll take the bus. 
 I can drive you. 
 No, no, no. Bus is a breeze. 
 [ Door closes ] 
 [ Sighs ] 
 You gave me Richard Patterson's name and told me not to act on that intelligence. 
 But you were counting on the fact that I would. 
 Why? 
 "Hello, Claudia, how are you?" 
 "I'm fine, Elizabeth. And you?" 
 Why did you want me to kill Patterson? 
 I admire your predictability, Elizabeth. 
 It's comforting. 
 I let him go. 
 Why? 
 It's not what you wanted. I know that. 
 But it's what I did. 
 I don't understand you. 
 You're not the only one who loved Zhukov. 
 You and Viktor? 
 Don't look so surprised. 
 We were a good match. 
 When you're a loner, there's nothing more satisfying than finding another loner to be alone with. 
 That's not true. 
 Viktor was easy to love. 
 Yes, he was. 
 Mm. 
 But you're not. 
 I don't believe you ever had a relationship with Zhukov. 
 I think you wanted me to go against KGB orders and kill Patterson so you could -- what? -- ship me off to Moscow, bring me to heel like your dog on some short leash? 
 Believing in people isn't easy for you, is it, Elizabeth? 
 I am on your side. 
 We've invested everything in you, count on you. 
 My only ambition is to make sure you're the best officers you can possibly be -- are trained to be. 
 If I have to be tough to accomplish this, I will be. 
 You really believe all that, don't you? 
 You've only ever wanted to hurt us. 
 And maybe in your mind you think it's better for the centre if we don't really get along, but you hate us. 
 I don't understand why. 
 Because we're better at this than you ever were? 
 Because I beat your face in? 
 You're still new at this, my dear. 
 So much to learn. 
 This isn't gonna go well for you, old lady.
