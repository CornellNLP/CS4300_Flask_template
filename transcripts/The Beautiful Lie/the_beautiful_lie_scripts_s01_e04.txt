 Everything will be different now. 
 Yeah! You got that right. 
 Now we're on the country, you'll get up early and go in the freezing cold to the train station. 
 Dolly? 
 Yes? 
 Sorry. 
 Please don't leave. Don't ever leave. 
 We've been friends for a long time, and I was wondering if maybe you and I could ever be more than friends. 
 I'd go through it all again in a heartbeat. 
 No regrets and no grudges. 
 I'm pregnant. 
 I want you to know that I'm here, a hundred percent. 
 This is us. 
 Thank you. 
 If you weren't such a dickless killjoy, maybe you'd still have a wife. 
 But I've had a lot of fun tonight. I love us. 
 Me too. 
 Come on, Kasper. Come on. 
 Come on, we're going. 
 To Mummy? 
 No. Mummy's gone. 
 ♪ Theme music ♪ 
 Anna, (V.O.) : All the decisions you've ever made add up to where you are now. 
 I would try to make things right by putting everything in its right place. 
 It's all I knew how to do. 
 I was superstitious. 
 Tennis players are like that. 
 Hey. 
 What's the bag for? 
 Uh, I wanna be ready. 
 Ready? 
 Yeah. 
 You've got, like, three months to go. 
 Not if something bad happens. 
 I've been having bad dreams, where I'm in labour, and I die. 
 Or the baby dies. 
 I keep thinking I can smell blood. 
 That's just so morbid! 
 I can't help it! 
 Look... when I was in the band, about to go on, my heart would be in my throat and I thought I was gonna be sick, until I told myself to just stop thinking. 
 Mm, I don't think that's the same thing, babe. 
 How about we forget about the imaginary medical emergency that you've got planned, and you come and see what I did? 
 Anna, (V.O.) : All I really wanted to do was to sleep in my own bed. 
 I wanted to wake up with Kasper beside me and not remember when he came in during the night. 
 I wanted that more than anything. 
 Are you recording today? 
 What, I didn't say? 
 You never say. 
 Here. Sit down. 
 OK, OK. Alright. 
 OK. 
 Take this. Lift your top up. 
 Hold this. 
 (Heartbeat thuds) 
 [Yeah?] 
 Thank you. 
 Anna, (V.O.) : Across town, Xander felt like one of Kasper's old toys that got stuck down the side of the bed. 
 Kasper! 
 He felt discarded, trapped inside his enormous self-built kingdom. 
 (Sighs) 
 Let's go. 
 Four bedrooms, three fridges, two garages, one pool, no Anna. 
 Woman : (On TV) Now slide your knees front and front so you're sliding front, almost like your back is going down and down. 
 Dolly knew how unattractive miserable people were, and so decided not to be one. 
 She pictured herself squeezing Kingsley between her fabulous and firm bottom cheeks until he pleaded for mercy. 
 sh1t! 
 Announcer : The next train to arrive on Platform 1 has been delayed. 
 As usual, Kingsley was reaping the benefits of his own life. 
 He had no idea why he kept landing on his feet... 
 Morning. 
 .. but he did. 
 Good morning. 
 Lucky day. 
 Oh, yeah? 
 Peter and Kitty hadn't left his bedroom for what seemed like months. 
 They were lost in the love bubble with no signs of emerging. 
 (Cries out) 
 Can I finish? 
 (Chuckles) Yes! 
 Kitty had developed a rash on her face. 
 It was something that the old Kitty might have covered up with make-up, put herself into hiding and moaned excessively about. 
 But Peter said it was cute. 
 He liked it, and the new Kitty believed him. 
 (Acoustic guitar plays) 
 Anna : Kasper! Come here. 
 Man and woman : ♪ Hello, Miss Lonesome ♪ 
♪ I see you're back in town ♪ 
♪ It's funny how I lose my mind when you come around... ♪ 
 Sorry. Hang on, Theresa. That goes A-minor, G, A. 
 (Hums sequence) 
 Theresa : Yeah, cool. 
 Er, from the top. 1, 2... 
 ♪ Hello, Miss Lonesome ♪ 
♪ I see you're back in town ♪ 
♪ It's funny how I lose my mind when you... ♪ 
 (Singing continues) 
 Found you, Mum! 
 (Laughs) But I'm meant to be looking for you! 
 Oh! 
 (Laughs) 
 Tickle, tickle, tickle! Tickle, tickle, tickle! 
 Hey, hey! 
 Um, we're getting something really great in there, but it's kind of worthless if there's a kid screaming over the top of it. 
 'A kid'? 
 What happened to recording the sounds around you, the natural rhythms of life? 
 There's a difference between cars and trams and birds and... 
 I... I just don't know if tonight's the best night for him to be over here. 
 The band's here. Things can get a bit... messy. 
 I'm not gonna let him sit at home with a babysitter. 
 I'm right here. 
 I get it. 
 Can we just try and keep it down a little bit, please? 
 Yeah. 
 Thank you. 
 Do you reckon we can keep it down? 
 (Yells) Yeah! 
 Shh! (Laughs) 
 Is that cool? 
 Looking pretty good. 
 Wow! 
 What do you want? 
 I don't mind. 
 Er, you can have leg, breast or wing. 
 You choose. 
 (Chuckles) The choice is yours. 
 What are you gonna have? 
 I'm gonna have a leg. 
 Then I'll have the same as you. 
 OK. 
 Do you wanna open another bottle? 
 Do you? 
 Um... yeah, why not? 
 Here we go. 
 This is so easy. 
 What is? 
 Being happy. 
 (Chuckles) Well, it can be. 
 Dolly and Kingsley, all they do is fight and bicker and say mean things to each other. 
 Anna and Xander, well, you know how that turned out. 
 We should just tell them. 
 All you have to do is one thing -- just be nice. 
 Well, you can't say what happens in a ten-year marriage. 
 I can't imagine what we'd ever fight about, can you? 
 (Chuckles) Well, no-one ever does until it happens. 
 Why don't we just make a decision, right now, that we won't do it -- we won't fight! 
 Even if we have a disagreement, we'll just let it slide for the sake of peace. 
 I hereby declare this relationship to be all about... s*x, eating, oh, and good conversation. 
 Mum, I want to stay with you. I wanna sleep in YOUR bed. 
 Oh. Sweetheart, we're just... we're in the middle of things at the moment and... sometimes the middle of things can be tricky. 
 OK. 
 Bye. See ya. 
 Mwah! 
 Mwah. 
 Bye-bye. 
 Bye, darling. 
 f*ck! 
 What are we gonna do with all these broad beans? 
 Um, I don't know. Put them in a salad? 
 Crush them into a paste and have them with olive oil on toast? 
 You've got all these ideas! 
 I love it. 
 I feel like I could ask you anything, and you'd know the answer. 
 I want to know everything about you. 
 I'm studying you. I wanna do my thesis on you! 
 I don't think there's that much more to know than you already do. 
 Of course there is! 
 Like, how many girlfriends have you had? 
 I thought we were talking about broad beans. 
 We were. 
 I'm just curious. 
 I don't remember meeting any of them. 
 Well, I don't know. 
 You don't know? 
 Does anyone? 
 I know! 
 I don't think this is very good territory to explore. 
 What are you hiding, Peter Matthew Levin? 
 I'm hiding nothing. I just... 
 I can't imagine this conversation ending in any way that's good. 
 Why? I'm not gonna get jealous. 
 Then why do you wanna know? 
 Well, how about I go first? 
 Don't tell me. I don't wanna know... 
 Six. 
 I've never told anyone that before. 
 Six? 
 Only two of them were serious, and you know who the last one was. 
 Your turn. 
 No, this is unfair. 
 Have you had any of your girlfriends here, on the farm? 
 Yeah, of course. 
 My parents lived here. I grew up here. 
 I've had the same bedroom my whole life. 
 So, all of them, is what you're saying. 
 (Sighs) No, not all of them, but some, yeah. 
 Most. 
 Morning. 
 (Distant chatter, clinking) 
 Woman : No, why? 
 (Laughter) 
 Morning. 
 Morning. 
 (Microwave beeps) 
 Sorry. 
 It's alright. I might just take myself out for breakfast. 
 OK, Skeet. Skeet! 
 So, um, what's tennis like? 
 Am I like any of them? 
 Who? 
 Your old girlfriends. 
 Can we please just drop it? 
 No! 
 It's like this place is haunted now, and I see them everywhere I look. 
 You've probably had the exact same moments we've had with all those other girls in the exact same bed, in the exact same sheets, in the exact same room. 
 You were probably wearing the exact same shirt as this morning when you woke up and kissed me. 
 They probably walked into the bathroom naked, like I did, sat down and weed like I did, and washed their hands like I did. 
 I'm probably even using the same towel! 
 Kitty, Kitty! Kitty, please! Stop it! You're being ridiculous. 
 Ridiculous? 
 You sound like my parents. 
 That is the single last thing I wanna be, OK? 
 I never wanna tell you what to think or what to do. I just... 
 For the record, I'd like you to stop asking. 
 Stop asking? 
 You can't make a single decision without asking me what I want first! 
 It's called being thoughtful. 
 OK, but I wanna know what you want, not what you think I want. 
 You wanna know what I want? 
 Yes, please! Tell me, anything! 
 I want you to sell the bed. 
 I don't care about the bed! 
 I'm not sleeping in it tonight. 
 I won't. It's disgusting. 
 Unbelievable! 
 What are you doing now? 
 What does it look like? 
 Um, you're a 26-year-old woman and you're having a tantrum, is what it looks like. 
 I'm angry. Leave me alone. 
 Look, I shouldn't have told you about my ex-girlfriends, OK? 
 I wish I hadn't. I was just trying to be honest with you. 
 I don't wanna live in lies, if that's what you're asking me to do. 
 We weren't fighting until then. 
 I want the truth, even if it hurts! 
 You were happier before. 
 Don't feel like you have to protect me. I'm a grown woman. 
 Do something that resembles one! 
 Like what? 
 I don't know! What do grown women usually do? 
 They usually have a job for starters, or can drive. 
 (Gasps) Oh! So, that's what this is about! 
 No! I just... 
 (Sighs) I think you'd be happier out here if you didn't have to rely on me to get everywhere. 
 I am happy! 
 See?! 
 And what kind of job would I get out here anyway? 
 I don't have all the answers for you! 
 Oh! There I go again. 
 You must think I'm a complete idiot because I care about your opinion. 
 Well, suit yourself. I've obviously outstayed my welcome. 
 I could easily leave you alone on this farm with your ghosts of your girlfriends past. 
 Maybe I'll become one. 
 (Sighs) I think I'm gonna go for a ride, OK? 
 There are mines everywhere. I just keep stepping on them. 
 Yeah, go on. Just run away. 
 Do you always get this hysterical when things don't go your way? 
 You think I'm hysterical? I haven't even started! 
 Jesus! 
 (Band plays loudly) 
 (Phone rings) 
 Sorry, can't talk now, Anna. 
 Dolly's brought the kids over, OK? Sorry. Bye. 
 10 points for civility. 
 You know what's funny? 
 I used to love Skeet when he was in Cop This. I had all their albums. 
 ♪ Take me to the sun... ♪ 
 That is a stupid lyric. 
 You can't go to the sun because you would die. 
 Skeet Du Pont. (Scoffs) 
 I never won in France. I hate clay. 
 I hate the French. 
 Now I know why. 
 He's not even really French, is he? 
 Oh, he'll always be French to me. 
 I don't wanna hear any more 'poor me'. 
 You're a competitive man, Xander. You're a national champion. 
 So what if Skeet won the first two sets? 
 The match isn't over. Get your shirt on. 
 Oh, my shirt's on. I never take it off. It's on. 
 Oh, it's off, alright. I've never seen it so off. 
 You're walking around with practically nothing on. 
 I've frozen all our assets. 
 I've got a team of lawyers making it impossible for Anna to get any money until we settle. 
 She can't have Kasper until she's got a place for him to sleep. 
 And I'll hold off signing divorce papers for as long as possible. 
 There's nothing attractive about being a miser. 
 You'll never win her back when you're money-grabbing. 
 There's no contest in that. 
 Well, what do you suggest? 
 If you've forgotten how to attract Anna, then relearn how. 
 Do what I'm doing -- be fabulous. 
 I fought for my marriage, and I finally feel as if the tables are tipping in my favour. 
 Kingsley's desperate for me, and I made him that way. 
 We've never been happier. 
 Anna : (On TV) As a sportswoman and mum, I know... 
 Great... how important it is to be healthy. 
 Nature's Wellness supplements give me the energy and vitality I need. 
 (Sighs) 
 I was at your wedding. Everyone there saw it. 
 The love you had was blinding. 
 That sort of thing doesn't just disappear. 
 Are you going mad in that big old house? 
 No! No, it's great. It's fine. (Chuckles) 
 And the truth? 
 Uh... Thank you. 
 A little mad, yes. (Chuckles) 
 It's OK. 
 Skeet works all night, and then sleeps all day and then works some more. 
 Oh, yes. Well, he's always been very obsessed about his music. 
 Sure, but how many times can a person listen to the same song over and over? 
 Well, as many times as you can hit a tennis ball, I suppose. 
 (Chuckles) 
 You wouldn't stop someone being good at what they do, would you? 
 No! No. I... No. 
 You were doing that on the plane, you know. 
 Oh, this. It's nothing. Um... 
 (Chuckles) I don't even know I'm doing it anymore. 
 15, 30, 40, game. 
 Ah! 
 Are you alright, Anna? Where are all your friends? 
 You're having a baby. You should have your people around you. 
 I feel like my husband inherited all our friends. 
 Ex-husband. 
 Yes. 
 You were lucky to get rid of him when you did. 
 I may... 
 I feel like I gave you a really bad impression of Xander on the plane. 
 No! No, no, no. I... I think you were being honest. 
 I mean, we were strangers. Why wouldn't you? 
 Yes, but I think... I made out like I was really annoyed with him, when actually, I was proud of my marriage. 
 I was in love. 
 And then, overnight, I wasn't. 
 How does that work? 
 Well, I think, um, if you're really in love, you don't just leave. 
 But who's to say what anyone will do? 
 Skeet and I met, and it just happened. 
 Before I knew it, we were together, and then... it was too late! 
 I think you knew what you were doing. 
 I guess so. 
 Yes.

 Hey. 
 Hey, what? 
 Um... 
 Hey, how long have you been sitting here with all the lights off? 
 How was your day? 
 My day? 
 Yeah, your day. 
 How do you think? 
 (Chuckles) I feel like you're still angry at me about my ex-girlfriends. 
 You're wrong. I couldn't care less about them, actually. 
 OK, then what? 
 Where have you been? 
 Checking the perimeters. 
 I thought that you left. 
 On horseback? 
 I don't know! 
 I live here. You're here. Why would I leave? 
 You packed your bags. 
 Well, you were gone all day. What was I supposed to think? 
 I thought you were waiting for me to leave before you came home. 
 No! I was doing some maintenance around the property. 
 Felt like I hadn't been out there for months. Maybe I haven't. 
 Cattle have ripped right through that bottom paddock, pulled the posts out in one area, they're running riot... 
 Hey! 
 (Sobs) 
 Hey, don't... don't cry. 
 We're OK. There's no need to cry. 
 I thought that you'd fallen out of love with me. 
 No. I'll always be in love with you. 
 I thought that it was over. 
 I thought that you hated me already. 
 (Chuckles) Well, it's not over for me. 
 I don't wanna be without you, ever. Today was horrible. 
 I've waited my whole life to be with you. 
 I'll never leave you. 
 I want you to feel safe with me. 
 I do. 
 Yeah? 
 I know. I do. 
 (Car approaches) 
 So, um, I might have called a few people. 
 It's OK, it's OK. We're fine. 
 You made it sound like an emergency evacuation! 
 Well, we're fine now. Sorry. 
 You just had your first fight, didn't you? 
 I guess we did. 
 Yeah. Survived. 
 Adorable. But next time you have a lovers' tiff, call Dolly. 
 Proximity. 
 Oh, Phillip, get back in the car. They're fine. 
 Come on! 
 We can still make bridge. 
 Am I a farmer? 
 Does weed count? 
 (Laughs) 
 I haven't seen anything you've grown we can eat yet. 
 We can eat this. 
 (Laughs) 
 It's really great. 
 Thank you. 
 I'm as stoned as I was on our honeymoon. 
 God, we were so out of it, remember? 
 Mm. 
 I thought my hand had become detached from my body. 
 Ah... (Laughs) 
 You got it into your head that you wanted to be naked in the water, remember? 
 Yeah? 
 You ran on down to the beach, straight into the water. 
 I was right behind you, and then five seconds later you'd shouted... 
 'Kingsley! Take me to the hospital!' - (Laughs) 
 It's not funny! 
 What? You always sound like a principal in an emergency. 
 You were so beautiful when they dug the spines out of your foot. 
 Beautiful like how? 
 Your cheeks were pink... and flushed. 
 (Laughs) 
 It's funny to hear you remember it. 
 You're the best, you know? 
 (Sighs) 
 The absolute best. 
 (Sighs) 
 This... This is nice. 
 Mm-hm? 
 Mm-hm. 
 I haven't even started yet. 
 Mummy! 
 Oh! Riley! Did you have a bad dream? 
 I wet the bed. 
 Stay right there. 
 (Laughs) 
 Principal Mummy to the rescue! 
 Shut up! 
 
 
 
 We'll get the sheets, eh? 
 Er, they're in Gabriela's room. 
 She's gone! I knocked! 
 Where could she possibly go around here? She's trapped. 
 (Laughs) 
 What? 
 (Chuckles) 
 (Knocks) 
 She's run away, hasn't she? She's run away. 
 I knew she would eventually. 
 Knock again. 
 But have we knocked too much? 
 (Giggles) 
 How much have we knocked? 
 She might be asleep. Knock again. 
 Gabriela! 
 (Laughs) 
 Alright, um... 
 Be stealthy. 
 Go in, grab the sheets, get out. 
 OK? 
 (Breathes deeply) 
 Oh, God! 
 What? 
 OK. 
 (Giggles) 
 Do I still get the sheets? 
 f*ck the sheets! (Laughs) 
 What are you doing? 
 f*ck, sh1t! 
 (Cackles) 
 (Laughter, chatter) 
 (Door shuts, woman laughs) 
 Skeet : Oh, no! 
 Dylan : I don't even blame her. 
 He's a renowned lazy lover. 
 Have some beer. 
 Theresa : (Laughs) What about this one? 
 Oh, no, please! No-one wants to see this. 
 Please! 
 But it's funny! 
 Yeah, funny for you. 
 (Giggles) 
 Oh, I loved this album! 
 I could sing it from beginning to end, if you'd like. 
 (Both Chuckle) 
 No! Thank you very much. 
 That's not a good idea. 
 It's cold. 
 It's not that cold. 
 (Scoffs) 
 sh1t! Anna! 
 Anna, stop. Stop! Don't be jealous. 
 Don't insult me. 
 I have been waiting for you to finish for nearly three days. 
 It is 3am, and you're still up with her! 
 It's never-ending! 
 Well, come and join us. 
 I would rather club myself to a bloody death with an axe. 
 sh1t, Anna, you're so dark! 
 Stop saying those things! 
 Just come to bed, please. 
 I want to. I want to, I really do. I just... 
 I can't. I mean, I can't, physically. 
 I'd just be staring at the ceiling for hours. 
 We took a tab of acid. 
 (Laughs) The walls are moving a little bit, and if I'm being honest, I think I can see through your skin. 
 (Chuckles) 
 I know how this ends up. 
 I was her once, remember? 
 And you found the connection OK? 
 Yes. 
 Well, the technology -- I'm still amazed that you can do that. 
 There he was, on the other side of the world, in Greece, and it was like he was right here -- such clarity. 
 Did... Did he call you back? 
 (Yeah, did...) 
 No. He won't call me anymore. 
 Oh. 
 We're really sorry, Gabriela. We were knocking. 
 We promise to find another cupboard for the sheets, first thing. 
 Maybe he wasn't the right guy for you. 
 Kingsley! 
 I'm just saying. 
 Not the best person to say it. 
 Hey, the man was sulking. 
 Greek men very proud. 
 You're beautiful, Gabriela. You're a good person. 
 You need to find someone with a sense of humour. 
 You could have anyone you wanted. 
 Within reason. 
 (Buzzing) 
 Hi. 
 Did you want something? 
 Uh... 
 No, nothing. 
 I don't want anything. Just... 
 Just to see you. 
 Um... 
 I don't know where to go. 
 I just wanna be home for a minute, and pretend that everything's OK just for a moment. 
 Mama, Mama, Mama! 
 Hi! 
 Oh! (Laughs) 
 Mama, Mama! 
 Hey, sweetheart. 
 Hi, Mum. 
 (Sighs) I suppose you'd better come in, then. 
 This is my new triceratops, and me and Dad made it. 
 (Gasps) I'll go get, um, my spy watch. 
 Remember these? 
 Oh, you have no idea how much I have missed these pants! 
 Go on, put them on. 
 Uh-huh. 
 Oh, yes! 
 Oh! 
 God, I am enormous! 
 No. I don't reckon you look big. 
 Really? 
 Yeah. 
 Thank you. 
 I've just been dying for someone to say that! 
 Xander, I have been having these terrible dreams where I die in childbirth or the baby dies. 
 Yes, but you also dreamt that you'd nailed me to the ground by the feet before you had Kasper, so I wouldn't worry too much. 
 It's just nerves and hormones. You're anxious, that's all. 
 You're having a baby, Anna. 
 Plus, you're probably just doing what you always do, which is trying to pretend that it's not happening until it's happening. 
 No, no. I packed my hospital bag already. 
 Do you think that's crazy? 
 No, I think it's good to be safe. 
 Did it make you feel better? 
 Yeah, it did. 
 Well, that's all that matters. 
 Mum! This is my new spy watch. 
 It has a, um, detector and a laser. 
 Byoo! 
 Cool! 
 Wow! 
 Anna, I know why you're here. 
 Stop pretending you didn't just come for pasta with all the cheeses. 
 Can I have some too, Dad? 
 Yes, we can all have some. 
 Turn on the TV and snuggle up with Kasper on the couch, and I'll cook. 
 Come on! 
 Thank you, Xander. 
 I really appreciate this. 
 Let's just, um... take a holiday from what happened. 
 Yeah. 
 I'm gonna tickle you. I'm gonna tickle you! 
 Hey, where are my trophies? 
 I put all your stuff in the garage. 
 Hm. Banished. 
 (Chuckles) 
 Yep. 
 Gathering dust with all my runner-up trophies. 
 A garage full of failures, of coming second. 
 You know, I always thought that if you tried hard enough, then you'd win. 
 I mean, I was good to you, wasn't I? 
 I tried to be. 
 Oh, always. 
 Then why did I lose? 
 I... I don't know! It's complicated. 
 You cleaned up. 
 Yeah, I did. 
 And they're gone. 
 They are. 
 I'm sorry. 
 It's OK. 
 I don't know what comes over me. 
 I mean, I've never been a jealous person, but... sometimes, it feels like you're shutting me out. 
 And my mind races when I think of you with Theresa. 
 Stop! 
 Come here. 
 Keep that demon of yours in her box. 
 OK? 
 Here. Look. Listen to this. 
 Here. 
 (Heartbeat thuds) 
 (Gasps, cries out) 
 Talk to me, Anna. What do you need me to do, baby? 
 Anything. 
 Help me! Help me! 
 (Sobs) You help me! Help me! 
 Is this normal? 
 (Sounds distort) 
 (Sobs) 
 She's haemorrhaging. 
 Where is he? 
 I'm here. 
 No, where's Xander? Where's Xander? 
 I want Xander. Where's Xander? 
 (Sobs indistinctly) 
 No! (Cries) 
 Xander! I want Xander. 
 Ow! Xander! 
 (Indistinct announcements over PA) 
 Hey. Where were you? 
 I'm here now. I'm here. I'm here. 
 I'm dying. 
 No, no, you're not. 
 No, I'm dying, I can feel it. 
 Shh, shh, shh. 
 I don't want Kasper to see me when I'm dead. 
 You're not dying, my darling. OK? 
 I can't look at you. 
 Hey. 
 I hate myself. 
 Don't say that. 
 I'm sorry. 
 Please don't hate me. 
 I don't hate you. 
 I don't hate you. Shh, shh, shh. 
 I'm here now. You're safe, alright? 
 Everything's gonna be alright. 
 OK? 
 Sleep. Sleep now. 
 Sleep. 
 (Sighs) 
 So, what happened? 
 She had an emergency caesarean. 
 Uh, lost a lot of blood. 
 She had to have a transfusion. (Clears throat) 
 And the baby? 
 She's in observation. 
 She. 
 Congratulations. 
 And you? 
 Are you alright? 
 She kept calling for you the whole time. 
 I'm a habit, I guess. 
 She just kept calling me your name. 
 She thought I was you. 
 This is just so f*cked up. 
 (Baby gurgles) 
 Oh. 
 What a mess, eh? 
 Hi. 
 Hello. 
 I'm Alexander. 
 Yes. Yes, I know who you are. 
 Anna's husband. 
 I meant the tennis player. 
 Oh. Like to meet your granddaughter? 
 Hello. 
 Oh, baby! Hello. 
 (Baby gurgles) 
 Oh. 
 Hello, gorgeous. 
 They've been through a lot, these two, over the last couple of days. 
 Probably just need some sleep. 
 How big of you to say so. 
 I've told Anna that she can come home if she likes, to recover. 
 To your home? 
 If that's what she wants. 
 Well, what about Skeet? 
 Oh, it's not about us anymore, is it? It's really about her. 
 I wouldn't believe what he said for one second. 
 Anna's sick. She was like a corpse. What could I do, argue? 
 He said he'd bring her back when she was better. 
 Oh, her husband is a creep. 
 You only just met him. 
 I never believed him in his post-game interviews. 
 He was always so... so complimentary of his opponent. 
 You can't know a man because you've watched him play tennis on TV, Ma! 
 He's a phoney! 
 Argh! 
 I wish he'd just hit me and get it over with, but he won't! 
 He's... He's too decent. 
 He IS fighting you, you idiot. 
 He's fighting you, and he's winning. 
 What was I thinking? 
 I broke this man by stealing his wife, and now she's breaking me. 
 She's a curse. 
 She's not. 
 She'll come back. 
 Oh, really? Then where is she now? 
 She's at home, with her husband. 
 Anna, (V.O.) : I can see how it might have appeared, but my home was my home. 
 Xander just happened to be in it. 
 (Engine runs) 
 Come on, come on! Give me some juice! 
 Straight. Keep it straight. 
 (Laughs) 
 Yeah! 
 Oh, stop. Stop! 
 What?! 
 (Switches motor off) 
 What? 
 Oh, no, I think you hit something. 
 (Gasps) Oh, my God, I feel sick. What is it? 
 I think it was... I think it was a cat. 
 A cat?! 
 Yeah, or, like, a baby possum. 
 No! 
 Yeah. Or maybe... 
 Oh, there's... yeah, it's... 
 What are you doing? 
 I don't wanna sound smug, but... I wanna say, I've always known we could be this happy. 
 I've had an inkling my whole life. 
 (Giggles) 
 There's no-one else on this earth for me, Kitty Ballantyne. 
 I'll never leave you, ever, to the point where it could possibly become irritating. 
 So, with that in mind... will you marry me? 
 Yes! 
 A hundred million times, yes. 
 (Squeals) 
 Ahhh... 
 (Laughs) 
 (Shrieks) 
 There's just so much about her that's Kasper as a newborn. 
 Yeah, there is. 
 Yeah. 
 I know there's never a good time to say these things, but... I'm really glad that you're home. 
 Kasper is happy for the first time since you left, and... look, I'm big enough to admit that... I'm glad you've given him a sibling. 
 I even think I could love her as my own. 
 I think I already do. 
 This, here... this is what we're good at, Anna. 
 This is where you're meant to be. 
 You're safe here. We're a family. 
 He doesn't know you like I know you. 
 There is nothing about you that scares me. 
 There's still so much that's good about our marriage, so much. 
 I don't wanna just throw that away. 
 I don't want a divorce. 
 I can't help it. I just don't. 
 You'll find someone, Xander. 
 (Door opens) 
 You will, because... you're great. 
 Dolly : Hello, darlings! 
 And... 
 Is this a bad time? 
 Oh, Anna! Hey! 
 Hey! Hey, hey, it's alright. 
 Hey! It's OK. 
 What am I doing here, Dolly? 
 I was surprised to hear you were. 
 I mean, I know that I was sick, but why did I come home? 
 I can't stop crying. 
 What have I done? 
 (Door buzzes) 
 (Buzzing continues) 
 Hey. Baby, your lips are trembling. 
 I'm just... 
 I don't wanna lose you. 
 I want to look into your eyes and let my brain reconfigure your face. 
 Hey, we're OK, Anna. 
 Alright? We just have a funny way of doing things. 
 (Laughs) 
 It's alright, darling. You can come in. 
 Come to Mummy. 
 Anna, (V.O.) : Kitty hated the old bed, and so she made an investment. 
 Whoa, whoa, what's... 
 Ta-da! 
 Whoa! 
 Peter hated the new bed and the idea of sleeping in his parents' old room, but he would never tell her, for the sake of peace. 
 Kasper : Peek-a-boo! Peek-a-boo. 
 Peek-a-boo. Peek-a-boo. 
 Peek-a-boo. 
 And me? 
 For the tiniest second, I had everything I wanted.... 
 (Baby cries) 
 .. and then it was gone. 
 You're back. 
 Um, darling, Mummy's gonna have to take the baby and go now. 
 Why can she go with you but I can't? 
 Well, maybe I can come and see you tomorrow or the next day. 
 I don't want you to! 
 Darling, wait. 
 Leave him. 
 I said leave him. 
 Anna, just... just go. 
 I don't wanna see Mum anymore. 
 Then you won't. 
 There you go, small little alien girl. 
 Sorry about the rocky start. 
 It didn't matter how much Skeet and I wanted to be together... there was something horrible in our happiness. 
 You alright? 
 Yeah. 
 (Engine starts) 
 I wanna see Kasper. 
 You abandoned him. 
 I didn't abandon him! 
 I'm the one who stayed. 
 Don't go. 
 I need to see my boy. 
 Got a hug for me? I'd like that. 
 No! 
 I don't want a lie at the centre of our marriage. 
 I'm on the verge of a tantrum. 
 Just make a decision and stick to it. 
 How did you and Nick meet? 
 Having a four-way. 
 Oh. Lovely.
