 Previously on "Dead of Summer"... 
 Blair : No one knows anything about him. 
 You only want him 'cause you can't have him. 
 We have a connection. 
 Sykes : Someone didn't want us to find this. 
 Joel : What's with the box? 
 It's a reminder. 
 I had a bad dream last night. 
 There were these people wearing masks. 
 I think they were doing some kind of ritual. 
 Amy! 
 It appears we were wrong. It's her. 
 [Footsteps approaching] 
 Andrea! You are going to ruin my flooring. 
 Oh, look at you. What did you do? 
 Look, Mommy. Look what I did. 
 Mrs. Walker made us draw pictures of ourselves. 
 Oh? A self-portrait? Show Mommy. 
 This is  your  picture? 
 But... But it's a boy. 
 I am a boy. 
 [Chuckles softly] Don't be silly. 
 You are my little beautiful Andrea, and you always will be. 
 You can't hide what you are. 
 Oh. Look who decided to join us. 
 Morning to you, too. 
 Hey, how come you don't shower with your cabin? 
 I was out for a run this morning, and I saw you leaving the bathroom. 
 Why do you care? You got a crush? 
 Any news on Amy? 
 Nothing. 
 I'm sure she's fine. 
 Really? You're a doctor now? 
 "Friday the 13th Part VII." 
 What? 
 Jason gets hit by lightning in the opening. 
 Not only is he fine, but he comes back to life, better than ever. 
 Yes, because supernatural monster rules apply to Amy. 
 Anything? 
 [Sighing] Yeah. I figured. 
 Well, I've got mail. 
 Blair... 
 Jessie... and... 
 What do I do with Blotter's? 
 Do what he was gonna do... smoke it. 
 Nice. 
 ♪ ♪ 
 Hey. Come on, you guys. Enough moping around, all right? 
 Look what I found. 
 [Laughter] 
 Summer of '83! 
 Summer of '83. 
 Wow. 
 [Speaking indistinctly] 
 Oh, no! Oh, man. 
 [Laughter] 
 Look at you. Wow. 
 Cricket, so cute. 
 Cricket : Oh, I look [speaks indistinctly] 
 [Sighs] 
 Joel : Oh, what was her name again? 
 Um, Andrea, and she was a total bitch. 
 She wasn't that bad. 
 I don't remember her at all. 
 She had pretty good taste in music. 
 Joel : Wonder what happened to her. 
 She's fine. 
 Amy is fine. 
 She's gonna make a full recovery. 
 In fact, the doctor said she's well enough to come back to work. 
 One day? After being hit by lightning. 
 "Friday the 13th." 
 Let's just welcome her back with some camp spirit. 
 I'm gonna push the schedule up a bit. 
 Tonight will be the masquerade ball. 
 All right, let's go make some masks. 
 ♪ ♪ 
 Sykes : I'm not sure what a post-lightning strike regimen should be, but my mom makes a mean chocolate shake. 
 Thanks. 
 Vanilla? I knew I should've gone vanilla. 
 No. It's just... What is this? 
 Forgotten bit of local history. 
 A cult trying to summon something from the lake? 
 Dark history. 
 It's just some research that I'm doing. 
 [Sighs] 
 What? 
 Nothing. It's crazy. 
 Tell me. 
 When I got hit, right before I fell in the lake, I think I saw a face. 
 Like that. 
 I told you it was crazy. 
 No. You're just shook up. 
 You didn't see this face. Or anything. 
 How do you know? 
 Because crap like this doesn't actually happen in the real world. 
 Then why are you so interested in all this? 
 I'm interested in people who would believe crap like this happens in the real world. 
 Anyone like that might be... 
 You know what? 
 How about you focus on your recovery, and I'll focus on the police work? 
 Come on. Let's get you back to camp. 
 ♪ ♪ 
 Damon : Teacher wants us to check our work. 
 Make sure we didn't miss anything. 
 Sykes is on our ass. How we gonna get back into camp? 
 We'll find a way. 
 [Water splashing] 
 [Splashing continues] 
 You can't hide what you are. You can't hide what you are. 
 Jessie : Dry off... 
 Andrea. 
 Whatever you think you saw, you're not gonna say anything about it. 
 And why is that? 
 I found this lying around. 
 Didn't know you had a court date coming up. 
 Does Deb know you lied about that on your application? 
 Are you threatening me, "Andrea"? 
 Just making it clear we both have a secret. 
 You keep mine. I'll keep yours. 
 And it's "Drew." 
 I'd watch my back if I were you... 
 Drew. 
 Wow. 
 [Laughs] That's amazing. 
 Ooh. Check this out. 
 Damn. She was always hot, even in her crazy hippie getup. 
 [Screams] No! 
 Oh, my God. That mask. 
 What about it? Deb said it was just an old piece of junk. 
 Wait. You've seen it? 
 Yeah. She had it in her cabin. 
 What'd I miss? 
 I think I'm losing my mind. You remember my dream? 
 Where you woke up and couldn't find your boots? 
 Those people in the woods, doing a ritual, wearing masks? 
 They looked like that. 
 So what? It was a dream. 
 Then why does Deb have one of those masks in her cabin? 
 And how come I still can't find my boots? 
 [Cheers and applause]

It's okay, sweetheart. It's okay. It's a good thing. Congratulations. You are now a woman. This isn't supposed to happen to me. I'm a boy. I thought we were over that. Mom! I'm a boy. You need help. [Water running] Drew? Drew? Are you okay? I mean, why'd you run off like that? What's wrong? Nothing. I just needed some air. In the bathroom? It was nothing. Look, I-I know that you're new to camp and our traditions, but this masquerade ball is actually kind of fun. Especially if you have a date. So... What do you say? You can't hide what you are. Drew? What happened in the bathroom? He was just kind of... looking right through me, and then he just bolted. Well, maybe he saw something, too. I mean, it has been going around. Now  you're  indulging this? My grandfather... I saw him the other night through my window. But he died when I was 10. So you were thinking about your grandpa. And you were thinking about your friend. And you had a bad dream. It's more than that. It's this place. What are you talking about? This lake. What if something is making  us see these things? Y'all been smoking too much weed. I haven't smoked anything. I'm not supposed to say this, but Garrett's been looking into it, he found stuff. There were all these crazy cultists here a hundred years ago. A dreams is a dream. A lake is a lake. You guys are freaking yourselves out over nothing. Hey, guys, I'm not going in that lake anymore. Look what I found. This place is a dump. Oh, my God. What? These are my boots. Dr. Martin : Well, we've had a breakthrough, Mrs. Dalton, and your child wants to share it with you. Okay, Andrea. I'm listening. That's just it. Um... I don't want you to call me that anymore. I'm not Andrea. That's your name. No. My name is Drew. No. It's Andrea. Your father, rest his soul, and I gave it to you. You gave it to me without knowing me. My name is Drew. You're fired. Mrs. Dalton... How many thousands of non-insurance-covered dollars have I given you over the past five years? We're done. Mom, please. Why are you doing this now? I can't pretend anymore. So you think you can just choose your s*x? You can just choose to be a boy? It's not a choice, Mom. I've told you that a thousand times. I held you when you were born. I raised you. You  are  a girl. I  am  a boy. Oh, please, Andrea. Drew. It's Drew. Can you say it? Just once? I-I'm still that baby you held in your arms. This doesn't change that. You could be happy for me. Or you could... you could love me for who I am. Who you are is Andrea. And as long as you're in my house, you will be Andrea. That is who I gave birth to, and that's who you'll be for the rest of your life. [Indistinct talking] Blair : I just don't really see there being a logical explanation for this. Cricket : Well, there is no logical explanation for it. It showed up on the shore. There's no way that it couldn't have been, you know, just a dream. If my dream was real, that means the mask was real, which means Deb might not be who she says she is. Deb? Really? Hey. She's the camp director. Satanists don't go around advertising it. You're really starting to sound like your mom. Deb is not Satanic. If she was, isn't Cricket right? Wouldn't she hide it? Exactly. How do we know she didn't put something in Blotter's acid? Maybe she gave me the same thing so that I wouldn't remember my dream. [Mask thuds] What do you think? [Shrieking] Drew? Drew! I'll be right back. Cricket : I don't know what's going on here, but we need to find out more about her. I think I can help. ♪ ♪ 
 
 Alex : Joel's camera. That's his personal footage. Mm. So sweet. So naive. So Joel's obsessed with Deb. He films her all the time. Come on. Amy's right. This is his private... Okay. What's up with the box? Not so sure. But in looking through this stuff, seems like she brought it back from the woods. What's in there? [Door closes] What the hell? [Clears throat] What are you doing with my camera? Hang on. It's okay. No, this is  not  okay. I-It's not you, Joel. It's Deb. She's been... suspicious. Look, I know you like her, but how much do you really know about her? You're wacked. ♪ ♪ You've never told anyone, have you? That you're gay. [Scoffs] I get it. It's scary, but I... I'm here for you... to help you. What are you afraid of? Rejection. Disappointment. Take your pick. Well, there's another look. Acceptance. Here. Check it out. Bowie? I always knew that I was... different. But I never knew how to talk about it. But then I came to camp, and I met someone. I didn't have to tell her I was gay. She just understood that I was different. And her response was to give me that tape. Bowie lives how he wants to live. He does what he wants, and he doesn't care what people think. Listening to Bowie gave me the courage to come out. And everyone just accepted you? Of course not. But Cricket did. She was the first person I told, and... that was enough. Knowing that there's just one person out there who supported me... it... it gave me the strength to face everyone else. Be my date to the masquerade ball. You can trust me. I accept you. No matter what. Okay. Well, think about it. I'm here for you, whenever you're ready. [Door opens, closes] How was that midday shower today? What do you want? I go running every day. Love to clear my head out in nature. And I always come across the most beautiful sights. So you know what I did? I took Joel's camera to record some of that beauty. It's really incredible what you can see out here... loons skimming the lake, elks feeding on grass... freaks taking secret showers. Why are you doing this? I thought we had a deal. Yeah. You  thought that. I told you to watch your back. We have a problem. Joel was chatting up Deb again. I heard him say he was gonna meet her at her cabin after the ball starts. What is he doing? I don't know. But we got to save him from himself. Her box. We got to get it. She's clearly hiding something. Maybe the answer's in there. Or we call in real help... Sykes. Yeah, you go call your boyfriend. We're not waiting around. Come on. ♪ ♪ Drew! You're leaving? Is it because you're freaked out? Because you're not alone. You're not the only one seeing things. You can talk to us. We understand. No, you don't. Good night, Mom. Beth : Good night, Andrea. ♪ ♪ [Knock on door] Andrea? You didn't tell me you got an "A"... Andrea? ♪ ♪ [David Bowie's "Ashes to Ashes" plays] [Indistinct conversations] Want to dance, Deputy? Jessie? Come on. I, um... I'm here on... on business. Business? What business? Amy : There you are. Come with me. Drew... He's so freaked out, he's leaving camp. Please. He's leaving because nobody likes him. Really, Jessie? Do you always have to judge everyone? Do you have to be everyone's friend? You used to be everyone's friend, too, Jessie. [Indistinct singing] Cricket and Alex are in Deb's cabin. We got to go. What's Deb got to do with this? You know how you told me you were worried about people in this world who believe crazy crap? ♪ ♪ [Gasping] Hey, it's okay. [Shuddered breathing] Deb, Deb, Deb, Deb, Deb. [Grunting] [Door opens] ♪ ♪ [Footsteps approaching] Right on time. Okay. Uh, are you gonna show me? Open it. Come with me. ♪ ♪ Relax. I come in peace. That tape I had of you? I never had it. I made the whole thing up. You pushed me. I was scared. But I was never gonna tell the other counselors about your letter. Really? Yeah. [Breathes deeply] You and me, we're kind of the same, huh? Both scared. You're scared of Deb finding out about your DUI? The DUI... It's complicated. There are... Um, you know what? It's just one part of it. What else happened? Let's just say I spent my life trusting the wrong people. Are you really gonna take the bus? You came back here for a reason. Why? You loved it, didn't you? Yeah. I don't know. Look, it was so long ago, I don't even really remember. Well, I loved it, too. Probably for the same reasons you did. My... home life sucked. And I'm guessing yours did, too. Look, when I was a kid, um... camp was the only place where I was never scared, where I could be myself. You know you  can,  right? You don't get it. Like, I'm not trying to hide who I am. I'm try... I'm trying to be who I am. I'm not talking... I'm not talking about being "Drew." I'm talking about being a jerk. I remember you, Drew. This cool, aloof, like, holier-than-thou guy? That's not the kid from '83. Thought you said I was a bitch. To me. You short-sheeted my bed, remember? Mm. Well, you were an easy target. I can't make you come back. But... [sighs] I hope you do. ♪ ♪ What is it? It's Joel. Deb was leading him into the woods. Okay. Everyone take it easy. Back to the party. I got this. Thank you. It's all right. I know it sounds crazy, Deb being involved... I don't know if Deb's involved or not. But I do know something is going on here. Now, get back. What do you  know? Amy, please... No, you know something. The map, that journal you've been reading... They all mean something. What are these crazy people trying to do? The best that I can piece together, I... They're trying to awaken some sort of demon. But I worry less about crazy people's motives than I do about stopping them. You ever think it's possible... that maybe some of it could be real? I don't rule out anything, Amy. But I don't let the ghost stories scare me. Does anything scare you? People who believe them. Now, go back to the party. I'll find Joel. ♪ ♪ Joel : [Breathing heavily] Deb, why are you bringing me out here? Turn off the camera. You wanted to know the truth? ♪ ♪ [Rattling] "Dharma Bums"?
