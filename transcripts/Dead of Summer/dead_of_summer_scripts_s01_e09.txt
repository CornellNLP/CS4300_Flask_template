 Previously on "Dead of Summer"... 
 Margot Tate. 
 Maybe we can be friends. 
 Love those ill-fitting Jordaches, by the way. 
 Wait, Margot! 
 [Screams] 
 [Screams] 
 There's more things coming. 
 Maybe you didn't save the world... but you might just be able to save these kids. 
 Find Amy. The demon lives within her. 
 Holyoke told me and Jessie... to come save you. 
 I know. 
 Woman : No! 
 [Gunshots] 
 No! 
 [Body thuds] 
 Aah! Let go of me! 
 You know where to go! 
 I have to get the kids out of here. 
 Right now. 
 [Amy screams] 
 Let us... begin. 
 ♪ Kissing like a bandit, stealing time ♪ 
♪ Underneath the sycamore tree ♪ 
♪ Slowly, but surely ♪ 
♪ Your appetite is more than I knew ♪ 
♪ Sweetly, softly ♪ 
 Need a lift? 
 You know how to get to Camp Stillwater? 
 I'm worried about a friend of mine. 
 Hop in. 
 [Eerie music plays] 
 Please, you guys, let me go. 
 I didn't mean to hurt him. 
 [Sobbing] 
 Joel, he was... He was one of us. 
 Sounds like her. 
 The demon is a master of deception. 
 [Eerie music plays] 
 Open it. 
 [Breathing heavily] 
 [Ropes creaking] 
 What kind of exorcism is this? 
 It's not an exorcism. 
 It's a purification. 
 That's the last pure water that exists from Lake Stillwater, and it will save Amy's soul. 
 That's why Malphas chose her. 
 Because she was pure. 
 Others have come before, hoping to summon the demon, but no vessel has ever been accepted until hers. 
 She has made Malphas more powerful than ever. 
 And that strength has left me weakened. 
 Now I must lead the purification myself. 
 Defeating Malphas is too important. 
 It will require every bit of my strength... and yours. 
 [Indistinct conversations] 
 Girl : I call back seat! 
 We're ready. 
 [Sighs] 
 You all right? 
 I never imagined this is how I would say goodbye. 
 You think they'll be okay? 
 I hope so. 
 Okay. 
 [Engine starts] 
 [Chuckles] 
 [ Silly cartoon music plays ] 
 [Laughs] 
 [Both laugh] 
 [Gasps, screams] 
 Amy! I told you to keep Ralphie in his cage. 
 It's mean to keep him in a cage, Mom. 
 He wants to be free. 
 He's mine. Get your hands off of him. 
 [Ralphie squeaks] 
 If you ever touch Ralphie again... 
 Dad! 
 He's your brother's pet. 
 But he's trapped! 
 Amy. Why don't you ever listen? 
 What's wrong with you? 
 [Sighs] 
 ♪ ♪ 
 Kevin : You really screwed up, Amy. It's bad this time. 
 Did you see Dad? 
 Stop it. 
 No, I'm serious. He's pissed. 
 And I heard him say something to Mom. 
 I think you should know. 
 Go away. 
 No, really, they don't like how you can't listen. 
 They don't want you anymore. 
 And they're going to send you off to live with Grandma. 
 I just want to play with Ralphie. 
 What's wrong with that? 
 Come on, kids. Play nice. 
 [Dishes clatter] 
 She doesn't want you upset when they come take you away. 
 [Electrical buzzing, squishing] 
 Amy : Something's wrong, Mom. 
 [Switch clicks] 
 Huh. 
 Mm. 
 Oh, yeah, something's stuck in there. 
 [Grunts] 
 [Screaming] 
 Ralphie? 
 Oh, no, no, no! You see what you did? 
 He's dead, and it's all your fault! 
 [Crying] I just wanted him to be free. 
 The water is like bars on a cage to the demon. 
 Then why go through all this? 
 Why not just bring Amy in there? Wouldn't that purify her? 
 It would. The demon would be killed... and so would the vessel. 
 The water is too powerful. 
 No one, no matter how pure, has ever been able to withstand it. 
 Don't listen to him. 
 He's the one who told Joel to kill me. 
 Prepare yourselves. 
 Malphas will try to fight back in ways that you cannot imagine. 
 He will try every trick in the book to get you to free him from his cage. 
 He's the one trying to trick you! 
 The demon cannot get out of the cage unless you allow it. 
 Do not open that door, not until our work is done here. Our work? 
 This spirit is a great corrupter of innocence. 
 It has taken Amy's soul from her. 
 It is up to us to restore it. And how do we do that? 
 The same way we fought darkness at this lake all these years... 
 With light. 
 ♪ ♪ 
 We must call to the spirits of light. 
 With their presence surrounding us, they will give us the strength to fight the demon. 
 Seriously? 
 That's how we're gonna beat Malphas? 
 It's an ancient invocation, one that has been used to balance the forces of the lake many times before. 
 Now let us begin. 
 ["Lo, How a Rose E'Er Blooming" plays] 
 [Gasping] 
 [Music stops] 
 [Wood creaking] 
 Is that it? 
 The spirits of light? 
 [Ominous music plays] 
 Alex : Oh, my God. 
 Wait. What the hell is happening?! 
 It's everywhere. 
 It can't... be. 
 Where's that coming from? 
 What is it? What's happening? 
 Holyoke! 
 [Wind rushing] 
 Alex : Holyoke! 
 What's happening?! 
 Holyoke! 
 Aah! 
 [Flesh rends] 
 [Ominous music plays] 
 [Electronic music plays in background] 
 Woman :  My prince. You found me! 
 [ Laughs ] 
 Hey, Amy, I want to show you something. 
 [Insects chirping] 
 What is it? What did you want to show me? 
 Now you're in the cage. 
 [Ominous music plays] 
 Kevin! [Pounding] 
 Kevin! 
 Kevin! 
 [Echoing, muffled] It wasn't my fault! Kevin! 
 [Door opens] 
 [Birds chirping] 
 Who are you? 
 Come with me, sweetie. 
 ♪ ♪ 
 Is this the girl? 
 Yeah. This is her. 
 What's going on? 
 Where's my mom and dad? 
 Honey, there's been an accident. 
 Carbon monoxide... is a poison. 
 The fireplace flue... was accidentally closed. 
 I'm so sorry. 
 Let me out of here! 
 Garrett : Let's all try to stay calm. 
 Calm? How the hell are we supposed to do that? 
 Look, I know how it looks. 
 Holyoke just turned into blood in front of us! 
 He called to the spirits of light. 
 Yeah, well, that's sure as hell not who answered. 
 Look at the windows. 
 I've seen him play that hymn before on that piano. 
 It looks like the piano was tampered with. 
 To weaken Holyoke so that it wouldn't work. 
 The cylinder... the wax cylinder we found here with Holyoke's voice? 
 That hymn was on the recording, played in the 1870s, before the piano was tainted. 
 I have it back in my car. 
 No, you can't go out there! 
 Jessie, we can use it to call the spirits of light! 
 We are  not  opening that door! 
 We have to be the spirits of light, which means finishing the purification... ourselves. 
 Alex : Are you out of your mind? 
 You want to do an exorcism without the exorcist? 
 Jessie, we have no idea what we're doing. 
 Amy : You guys, you're talking crazy. 
 Untie me, and we can figure this out together. 
 Everything we need to know is in here. 
 No, Jessie, it... - I know this sounds crazy, but if you guys just trust me, I think I can lead us through this. 
 This is Amy's life... her soul... her innocence! 
 They've been ripped away from her, and it's up to us to get them back! 
 Holyoke is gone. 
 We're all she has now. 
 [Sniffles] 
 Lead the way, Exorcist. 
 [Sighs] 
 It says here that the purification can only begin after we get the demon to reveal its true self. 
 Hold her down. 
 Don't let her go. 
 ♪ ♪ 
 This might get worse before it gets better. 
 Jessie, you don't want to do this. 
 It's me. 
 I'm sorry, Amy. 
 [Gurgling, screaming] 
 Stop! 
 Stop! 
 [Screaming] 
 Stop! It burns! Jessie! 
 [Demonic growl] 
 Malphas is trying to pull her away from us. 
 We have to pull her back. 
 Talk to her. 
 Remind her who she really is. 
 Amy? 
 Amy, listen to me. 
 You remember when we first met? 
 I could sense that you were good right away. 
 And this summer, you've proven that. 
 People love you here. 
 We  love you. 
 This is your home, Amy. 
 Amy. 
 [As Jack Sykes] I died because of you, kiddo. 
 [Ominous music plays] 
 I'm here with Heelan now. 
 We're waiting for you. 
 Go to hell. 
 [Demonically] Don't turn your back on me! 
 There he is. 
 There's the demon. 
 Hey. 
 [Suspenseful music plays] 
 [All screaming] 
 What the hell?! 
 Everyone... j-just calm down! 
 [Screaming continues] 
 Calm down! 
 Girl : I'm scared! 
 Okay. It's okay. 
 Calm down! 
 [Screaming stops, children whimpering] 
 What the hell did we hit? 
 I'll go check it out. 
 [Suspenseful music plays] 
 I can't see anything. 
 [Gasps] 
 Marvin! 
 [All screaming] 
 Malphas, you have no dominion here. 
 This is a haven of light. 
 [Speaking Russian] _ 
 What is it? What is she saying? 
 Don't listen to her, Alex. 
 [Growling] 
 [Loud crash] 
 [All screaming] 
 Everyone, calm down! 
 Calm down! 
 Okay, we're gonna be all right. 
 As long as we're in here, we're safe. 
 [Low-pitched growling] 
 What's out there? 
 [Sighs] I don't know, sweetie, but we're not gonna let it hurt you, okay? 
 What does it want? 
 I don't know. 
 [Squeaking] 
 [Crash, demonic growling] 
 [All screaming] 
 What the hell is out there? 
 I don't know. 
 Whatever it is, it's gonna burst in here if we don't do something. 
 We have to save these kids. 
 They'll be safer here. 
 I'll try to buy you some time. 
 Deb, wait. 
 The second you get this thing going, you don't stop no matter what, promise? 
 Deb. 
 Promise. 
 Close the door behind me. 
 [Demonically] You're all going to die. 
 Malphas, we know your name. 
 The water washes your filth away. 
 Be purified. 
 Aah! 
 [As Amy's Father] What's the matter with you, Amy? 
 Don't you ever listen? 
 Together : The water washes your filth away. 
 Be purified. 
 Aah! 
 The water washes your filth away. 
 Be purified. 
 [Screams] 
 [As Kevin] Mom and Dad don't want you. 
 [Normal voice] It hurts. It hurts so much. 
 [Crying] 
 She's... She's been through a lot of pain in her life. 
 It's all coming out now. 
 Fight through it, Amy. 
 You can do it. You're strong. 
 Garrett? 
 [Roars] 
 Aah! 
 Amy! 
 Aah! 
 Here, here! 
 [Spits] 
 I'm impressed with the number of breakthroughs that have happened this week. 
 It takes a lot of effort to heal the wounds that restrict our lives. 
 
 
 
 [ Muffled rock music plays ] 
 Amy? 
 Haven't heard from you in awhile. 
 You must be excited about your new home? 
 Home? 
 I've moved seven times in the past nine years. 
 Hunter High has an exceptional reputation. 
 Maybe you'll even meet a friend? 
 I'm tired of being the new girl. 
 You've lost a lot, Amy... More than most. 
 But you can move forward. 
 You can find the home that you're looking for. 
 ♪ ♪ 
 I know it. 
 Jessie : The demon is getting too strong. 
 We have to call to Amy again. 
 Garrett : I'll read the incantation.

 I was cold to you when you first came here. 
 I am so sorry if I ever made you feel unwanted. 
 I didn't know you then, but I do now.

 Yeah. It's me. 
 The bus... broke down. 
 The kids are so scared. 
 Is Amy okay? 
 Amy : What happened? 
 I think she's back. 
 We have to get her some help.
