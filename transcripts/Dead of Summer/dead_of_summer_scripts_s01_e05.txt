 Previously on "Dead of Summer"... 
 I got to go. 
 What did I do? Cricket! 
 Who are you? 
 Look, you said you could accept me. 
 Blair... 
 Every time I see you, you seem to be filming something. 
 You know what they say. 
 The camera never lies. 
 I feel like I could talk to you all night. 
 Gross. She's like your mother's age. 
 Cricket : Deb might not be who she says she is. 
 Deb is not Satanic. 
 Amy : If she was, isn't Cricket right? 
 Wouldn't she hide it? 
 Garrett : But I do know something is going on here. 
 Amy : You ever think it's possible... that some of it could be real? 
 The Tall Man has said, "It's only just begun." 
 [Upbeat music playing softly] 
 [Imitating James Bond] Do you expect me to talk? 
 [Imitating Goldfinger] No, Mr. Bond. 
 I expect you to die. 
 [Laughs] 
 Oh, check it out, Joel! 
 Do you think I could pass as 007 at prom? 
 Joel : Maybe... 
 If everyone there was blind. 
 Oh, okay. 
 [Laughs] 
 [Switches camera off] 
 You know, I'm gonna miss you, bro. 
 A few more weeks, you'll be off at camp, man. 
 I wish you could come with me. 
 Nah, I've had my own experience with Stillwater. 
 You got to experience it for yourself. 
 As the geeky kid that nobody can believe is related to you? 
 Let's see them call you geeky in that. 
 I could fit four of me in this. 
 It depends how you wear it. 
 Perception beats reality every time. 
 I can't believe you're giving me your favorite shirt. 
 Just thank me when you win your first Oscar, okay? 
 Deal. [Laughs] 
 My man. 
 [Whispering, echoing] 
 [Wind whistling] 
 What's wrong, Michael? 
 Did you... see something? 
 Uh, I-I see a kid who's gonna make me late for prom, man. 
 Come on, I got to get out of here, punk. 
 I got to get showered and get this tux on before the limo gets here. 
 [Laughs]

 [Munches] 
 Come on, guys. 
 We're supposed to hit the trail in a half hour. 
 What are you doing? 
 We're not going anywhere till we get some answers. 
 About what? 
 Last night. 
 Yeah, where'd you and Deb disappear to? 
 [Sighs] Seriously? 
 Cricket : She, uh, bring that creepy mask with her? 
 We were worried about you. 
 Some  of us. 
 That mask isn't even hers. 
 Okay, you guys have the wrong idea about Deb. 
 Yo, man. You totally banged her! 
 What? 
 No, I didn't. 
 Yeah, you did. 
 And I know you got it on that camera. 
 Come on, let me check it out. 
 [Scoffs] 
 Come on, let me check it out. 
 You guys are crazy! 
 Come on, Joel! 
 You're the one who had s*x with someone twice your age. 
 We want details... now. 
 Well, you and Drew got pretty serious at the masquerade. 
 Why don't you give us some of those  details? 
 And on that note... 
 Yeah. 
 Yeah. 
 Yeah. 
 Yeah. 
 [Upbeat music playing] 
 All right, come on! 
 We're gonna make camp at High Meadow! 
 We're gonna pitch our tents and then cook dinner. 
 You guys will get to see every star in the sky from up there, and there's a Blood Moon tonight, so it'll be extra awesome. 
 Everyone follow Cricket's lead. 
 She is our resident outdoor specialist. [Chuckles] Pick a partner, stay in groups, and don't wander off the path! There are bear traps hidden everywhere in these woods. [Indistinct conversations] You really like her, huh? I'm sorry about the confusion last night. If we had known... Yeah, don't worry about it. I know it's none of my business, but I think it's great... you two. Who cares what they say? It's not easy to make a connection with someone. If you're lucky enough to find it, you should go for it, right? Right. Alex : Boo! [Children screaming] Hey, hey, what's going on? Alex said there's a monster in these woods! [Dramatically] Yeah, a flesh-eating ghoul with a taste for camper blood. [Children screaming] [Chuckles] Let's go. Whatever, Jessie. Come on. Bye, Alex. [Wheezing] Hey, are you okay? [Shakily] I can't breathe. I think she needs her inhaler. It's in the top of her bag. All right, I got it. It's gonna be okay, just relax. [Squirts, inhales deeply] There you go. [Breathing heavily] Better? Don't worry, Francie. It's just a story. Nothing in these woods will hurt you. I promise. Okay. All right, go with Jessie. It's okay. [Grunts] Amy. ♪ ♪ [Whooshing] Leave me alone. ♪ ♪ [Breathing heavily] [Birds chirping] Are you okay? Did you see something? Nope. [Chuckles] I'm good. [Camera whirring] [Upbeat music playing softly] Okay, say cheese. Smile. [Camera shutter clicks] Man : What is taking your brother so long? Limo's waiting. I'll go get him. Michael? Michael? [Water running] [Banging on door] Michael?! [Hinges creak] ♪ ♪ [Screaming] [Birds chirping] Okay, Alex and Cricket, firewood detail. Drew and Blair, get the food organized. Amy and Jessie, we need water from the stream. And, Joel, you'll stay back with me and help me pitch the tents. Hey, have fun pitching Deb's tent. You know I will. [Chuckling] Oh. Amy. Yeah? Um, be careful out there. [Indistinct conversations] Is that really necessary? I found it in the staff lounge. I figured it could come in handy, being my first overnight and all. Hey, is everything okay with Joel? He seemed kind of off. Maybe he's just not as taken with you as Garrett. Excuse me? I saw you last night with your tongue down his throat. I am  so  confused. Amy, just stop, okay? I saw you guys kissing. I don't remember kissing him at all. So many freaky things have been going on here. It's this place. No, it's you. Stop putting up a front. If you're into him, just say so. If you're into him,  you  say so. What are you talking about? The only one putting up a front here is you. And Garrett's not the only one of your old friends who doesn't like it. [Children laughing in distance] [Tapping] [Grunts] Joel. [Exhales] Can you put the camera down for a second? I could, um... I could use a hand. I, uh... I can't get the stake to stay in the ground. [Chuckles] Yeah, yeah. One second. Allow me. [Clears throat] [Laughs] There you go. Nothing is knocking this thing down. Unless the cast of "Deliverance" decides to show up. I think about that movie every time I go camping. How can you not? [Laughs] Want to test it out from the inside, make sure it's extra sturdy? Um... [Chuckles] What? I mean, it'd be hard to top last night, but I'm sure we could try. You mean the masquerade? [Laughs] You're funny. Yeah, I get it. It's not the time or the place. Maybe later. You all right, Joel? Yeah. It's just that when you really make a connection with somebody, it's pretty great. That's sweet. Thank you. [Sighs] No way I'm doing ruffles. Hey, don't film this, Kenny. I look like a... A hunk? [Chuckles] You mean dork? Hey. Come on, there's nothing dorky about you, babe. You look like Bond. Yeah? Which one... Connery or Moore? Mm, Lazenby. Ow! You just... Come on, you're a million times hotter than all those guys, and you know it, Mr. Golden Boy, early acceptance to NYU Film School. [Laughs] You better put me in all your movies. Oh, you didn't know? Hmm? You're already in one of my movies. It's called [French accent] "The Fitting Room." [Laughing] Stop! [Normal voice] Come on, come on. You can't be shy if you're gonna be in my movies. No, no, put it down. Joel! All right, all right. [Laughs] ♪ ♪ Joel? What are you doing? Nothing. [Sighs] Are you gonna help me at all? I would love to, but, uh... How's this one? No, not that one. Too flimsy? Too green. It'll smoke, not burn. You really are still queen of the overnight, aren't you? Mm-hmm. Hey, remember when we used to call you Davy Cricket? Yeah, I remember  you calling me that  and me hating it. Oh, come on, you liked it. Come on, admit it. What are you doing? I told you, they're everywhere. [Trap clangs shut] Whoa. Not funny. You should keep your eyes open. We all should. And why is that? Because bear traps aren't the only thing we should be worried about. Even if it wasn't Deb, I still saw someone in that mask. I didn't imagine it, and they could still be out there. You know, it seems like... you need something else to focus on. Oh, yeah? Yeah. You know, I was thinking, maybe I'd come here tonight, after lights out, and watch the Blood Moon. You want to join? You mean, do I want to have s*x with you under the Blood Moon? I did not say that. I know you. Maybe I've changed, Cricket. Or maybe I'm the first girl that's ever turned you down, and you can't handle it. Enjoy the Blood Moon. Amy :  "The right stick is essential to the perfectly roasted marshmallow." I've got one. [Gasps] Nice! [Laughs] Here, let's switch. Watch out, buddy. Oh, sorry about that. That's okay. Prom date? Hey. [Gasps] You guys look happy. We were. Studying up? Couldn't hurt, right? Plus, you did seem worried about me earlier. Yeah, sorry. Guess I was a little paranoid. You're good now, though? Yeah. Okay, let's see. How you doing? [Exhales] ♪ ♪ [Children laughing] [Breathing shakily] [Birds chirping] Kill... Amy... tonight. [Gasps] Or someone else will die. [Upbeat music playing] Blair. What's Cricket's favorite song? Why? What do you care why? [Chuckles] Is this that thing that straight guys do when girls reject them? Come on, favorite song... easy answer. Blotter already made her a mix tape. Yeah, I know. I was hoping maybe he'd forgotten a track. He did, actually. "The Killing Moon," Echo & the Bunnymen, her all-time favorite. "Killing Moon"? Mm-hmm. Okay. Hey, you got "Killing Moon," Drewski? Grab it from my tent. Also, never call me Drewski again, or I will end your life. Fair enough. [Scoffs] That was really cool of you. Look, I don't blame you for being mad at me. I just wanted to say... Okay, you had your chance. Well, I'm asking for another one. You showed me who you are. I showed you who I was. What's left to say? Oh, God! Someone forgot to put ice in there. Deb : Ugh. Okay. It's okay. Um, there's hot dogs, uh, down at the camp. Not it! I'll go. Thank you. Kill her. Amy, don't go. Why not? Uh... [Chuckles] She doesn't know these woods. So go with her. Follow her. When she's alone, kill her. No. No? Okay. Uh, Amy, you're better with the kids. Jessie and I will go. Exactly. It's your choice. Her... or someone else will die. Ow! Do you see this, Laura? I went old-school. I got the white limo. I got the... orchid. I'm even gonna bribe the deejay to play that Paula Abdul song you love. [Claps, sighs] [Inhales, exhales sharply] It's gonna be a perfect night. [Whispering, echoing] [Upbeat music playing softly] What do you want?! [Breathing heavily] [Bird cries] ♪ ♪ Where are you? I'm showing this to the cops! ♪ ♪ [Exhales shakily] Man : Hey! Joel : Oh, Dad. You okay? I, uh... I heard you yelling. Yeah, uh, I was just... this thing is... I can't figure it out. [Both chuckle] I got frustrated. I figured I'd just come outside and get some fresh air. Here, let me help you out. Now, you better get used to wearing a tux. Tonight the prom, tomorrow the Emmys. Oscars. It's Oscars for movies, Dad. Yeah, well, whatever it is, I will be there front row and center, cheering you on. Thanks, Dad. Are you nervous? About tonight? [Shakily] I'm just thinking about Michael. Prom night. Did he ever tell you what he saw? No, he never would. We didn't know what he was seeing or why he was so... so scared of it. Me and him. I mean, it doesn't matter, does it? Whatever he saw, it wasn't real. Just a sickness in his mind. I thank God that you will never... never have to face that nightmare. Are you sure you're okay? You know, whatever it is, you know you can tell me, right? Maybe I'm a little nervous. [Chuckles] Don't want to disappoint Laura. [Laughs] You won't. 
 
 [Birds chirping] Hey. What's up? Kids okay? Yeah, kids are okay. Um... [Sighs] But I'm not. I had a feeling something was up. What is it? I've never told anyone this before. It's all right. Yeah. I feel like I have a connection with you. [Chuckles] Yeah. [Chuckles] Hey. What are you doing? I thought... You thought what? I want to help, Joel, I do, um, but I'm... I'm still your boss. What are you talking about, you're still my boss? What about last night? You can't just act like that didn't happen. [Scoffs] Act like what didn't happen? We went for a walk. I told you about Keith. That's... it. Um... Why don't you tell me what's really going on. Um, I... I... I guess I just... I read more into it. I'm sorry. It's okay. Uh, I'm gonna go. [Breathing heavily] ♪ ♪ [Breathing heavily] [Whirring] [Breathing heavily] [Whirring] Tall Man : You can't make me go away. Not here, not until you kill Amy. [Insects chirping] Remember, you're the boss, okay? Don't let the marshmallow win. [Grunts] You should go. To his Blood Moon rendezvous? No, thanks. I think he's changed. Please. He's a dirt bag, and you know it. If all he wanted was to sleep with you, why would he ask me what your favorite song is? He asked you my favorite song? Yeah. He's putting himself out there. Just give him the chance. You're running out of time. [Squeals] Don't do that. [Breathes shakily] You could hurt yourself. Joel. Kill Amy. Her, or someone else will die. Who will it be? You're running out of time. [Echoing] Who's it gonna be? ♪ ♪ Joel? Where's your camera? It's usually attached to your hand. It's not working. Is it broken? It doesn't work here. [Camera shutter clicks] [Laughing] Ah. Ah. That was a good one. My eyes were closed. I want a do-over. You looked gorgeous, babe. [Echoing] Come on. Wait, you're bringing that? Yeah, it's... it's our prom night. Don't you want to remember this forever? Tonight's about us, our  memories. You don't need a camera for that. Hey, Laura, come here. Okay. [Hip-hop music playing] You're not real. You're not real. [Thunder crashes] You're not real. Who are you talking to? No one. Uh... [Chuckles] All right, you're right. I'll be right back. I'm just gonna go check this. Woman : Hey, how's it going? Here you go. Yeah, I can take that for you. Thanks. What are we waiting for, huh? Oh, you ready to dance, or what? Get over here. [Giggles] Huh? [Both laughing] [Hip-hop music playing] [Jessie sighs] I mean, cut Blair some slack. He... he's... He ran out on me. So? Now he wants to un-run. You have no idea what it's like to be that open with someone. [Scoffs] You can't even tell Sykes about your court date. Just saying. [Insects chirping] What's that? I think that's the cabin that Alex took Amy on their date. Hot. [Gasps] [Exhales] [Exhaling] What are you doing here? I'm patrolling camp while everyone else is supposed to be on the overnight, so why aren't you with them? We were. We [Stutters, sighs] We are. Hmm. Okay. Um, I'm gonna take this. You know how to get back, right? Yeah. Great. So, what brings you out here? Going in there. Do you want some company? Sure. ♪ ♪ [Door opens] [Hinges creak] What is this place? It's just an old hunting cabin. You're a terrible liar. It's part of an investigation I'm conducting. Into what? Did you know Stillwater was a Spiritualist camp? Oh, like those cultists Amy was talking about? She told you? I didn't realize it was a secret. Why are you being so cagey? There was a raid on this cabin in 1871. They were after a Spiritualist leader named Holyoke. People in the lake were his followers. What happened to them? The same thing that always happens with these cults. Everybody dies. But this was over 100 years ago. Why are you... Because I still think there might be some followers kicking around. Come on, seriously? Last night, I saw these people down by the lake. They were wearing these masks. Well, it was a masked ball. I mean, they could have been anyone. Yeah, maybe. But I still wanted to come check this place out, make sure nobody's been digging around, getting ideas. Look. ♪ ♪ What the hell is that? This is how people used to record things in the 19th century. "Holyoke"... that's the guy you were just talking about. That's him, right? There's something else. What is that, a coin? It's a cufflink. J.S. Jack Sykes. This belonged to my father. [Insects chirping] [Sighs] [Exhales] You think she's gonna come? Only one way to find out. Get down there and wait for her. I can do that. Thanks. Hey! Hey! [Chuckles] Where you going? Uh, to watch the Blood Moon. Alone? Hopefully not. Is there a problem? Just be careful. Sure thing, Dad. Hey, um... thanks for the tape, buddy. Yeah, I don't like "buddy," either. Hey. Good luck. I hope she shows. Thanks. Where's Jessie? She's with Sykes. Is she okay? She's fine. What's wrong with you? I'm just making sure that she's okay. Hey. That everyone's safe. Tall Man : [Echoing] No one is. No one is until you kill Amy. [Footsteps approaching] Amy : Guys. Deb needs us now. Where did you leave it, sweetheart? Do you remember? What happened? She lost her inhaler. She can't breathe if we don't get it back. [Francie wheezing] Tall Man : Or someone else will die. Hey, Francie, do you think you might have left it where we stopped earlier? Yeah? I'll go get it. I'll go with you. No. You stay here. Hey, listen, maybe Amy should go. You've been a little out of sorts lately. No, I can do this. I have to do this. Here, take this. Just in case. [Tent flap slides] Tall Man : You have something else to do. No. She's not dying. [Breathing heavily] No one is. Did you know your dad had been here before? I didn't even know this place existed until a few days ago. What do you think he was doing here? Considering where we found this, he was doing the same thing we are. [Phonograph clicks] Holyoke :  My bright ambassadors of morning! It is time to make peace. Lay down your burden. Is that him... Holyoke? Take the potion and step through quietly. Potion? I think he's telling them to kill themselves. Believe in the power of the lake, and it will reveal the truth. He was evil. But his followers? They did anything he told them. Anything. Take the potion and step through. [Warble] [Breathing heavily] [Paul Abdul's "Cold Hearted" playing] ♪ He was out there sneakin' ♪

[Indistinct shouting, screaming] [Grunting] [Screaming] What are you doing?! What are you doing?! [Whimpers] [Crying] [Insects chirping] [Breathing heavily] [Gasps] [Knife clicks] What are you doing here? I was worried. You shouldn't be out here alone. Kill her. Do it. [Breathes shakily] Now. Joel? What are you doing? Her, or someone else. Her, or someone else. Her, or someone else. Her, or someone else. Joel. [Breathing heavily] Joel. [Gasps] Put down the knife. Kill! No. Kill her! Kill her! [Breathing heavily] He'll never leave me alone. Who? There's no one here. Joel, stop! Stop! [Whimpers] Kill her! There's no one here. There's no one here. [Breathing heavily] Everything's gonna be okay. Just breathe. [Crying] It's okay. It's okay. [Sobbing] Here you go. Get home safe. Okay. [Glasses clinking in distance] Is Kenny okay? No, he's not okay. You broke his nose, and he didn't buy your lame excuse, either. I  was  drunk. You had half a beer in the limo. What's going on, Joel? Tell me the truth. I already told you. I knew Michael, too, and you're acting just like him. Michael kept everything inside, and it killed him. If he'd asked for help... What killed him was being seen as a freak. The minute he told my parents, they looked at him like a crazy kid. They never looked at him the same. I will never look at you like that. You don't have to pretend with me, Joel. You don't have to be perfect. Just talk with me. I want to help you. [Exhales] I don't need your help. We're done. Deb : Hey. Well, Francie's breathing normally again. She's gonna be okay. Thanks to you. [Chuckles] Now, everybody, get to bed. It's been a long night... for all of us. [Sighs] Guess that's my cue, too, right? So you're gonna go meet him? [Clicks tongue] Got to give it a shot. I'm proud of you. Hold the pride till we see how it goes. [Both chuckle] Uh, hey, Blair? Go ahead. It's okay. [Joel sighs] I need to talk to you guys. [Owls hooting] My whole life, I've tried to be strong. You know, act like everything was fine, but I haven't been honest about who I really am. I used to have a brother. [Voice breaking] Michael. [Breathing shakily] When Michael was my age, he killed himself. [Sighs] He saw things that... weren't there. Michael had a sickness. [Sniffles] And now I have that sickness, too. My camera [Sighs] used to be the only thing that I could trust to show me what's real. It never lied. [Sighs] But now the camera's not working, and I'm getting worse. What do you mean? There's a man. [Exhales] I started seeing him before I ever came to camp. I think Michael saw the same man. He never [Sighs] left him alone. And now he's following me, asking me to do things. Terrible things. Like what? [Shakily] Tonight he told me to kill Amy. Or else someone else would die. Amy : He's not real. You know that, right? That's just it. I don't know what's real and what isn't anymore, and I'm worried. If I don't find a way to stop seeing him... I'm gonna end up just like Michael. I need to leave camp. [Voice breaks] I need help. We'll help you, too, Joel. Whatever you need. You don't have to hide things from us. We're here for you. Thanks. What'd I miss? [Chuckles] It's been a night. You and me both. I ran into Garrett in the woods. He was checking out this old cabin. We found recordings of this cult leader telling all of his followers to kill themselves. Holyoke. You know about him, too? Garrett told me not to say anything. He didn't want us freaking out. There's nothing to freak out about. He's dead. Still, he's pretty creepy. [Gasps] Joel, what is it? [Breathing heavily] That's him. That's the man who's been following me. Joel, what if your brother wasn't sick? What if the man he saw... the one you've been seeing... what if that was Holyoke? Ghosts? Seriously? It's what I've been saying. It's this place. There's something here. Something that  knows  us. This place, it feeds on our weaknesses, and Holyoke has something to do with it. Come on, Amy. Even if that  were  true, why is Joel the only one who's seen him? He isn't the only one. The Tall Man... that was him. You've seen him, too? Why us? What does he want? He told you what he wants. You didn't listen. What did he say? Did he tell you why he's speaking to us? No. What did he say? He said you should have killed her when you had the chance.
