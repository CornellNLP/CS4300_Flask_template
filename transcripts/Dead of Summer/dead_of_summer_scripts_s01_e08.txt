 Previously on "Dead of Summer" 
 Blair : Carolina Maria Diaz, if you wish to communicate with us, give us a sign. 
 [Crunching, screaming] 
 Amy! 
 What happened to me? 
 We woke something up. 
 I spent my life trusting the wrong people. 
 Drew : You're scared of Deb finding out about your D.U.I.? 
 Camp was the only place where I could be myself. 
 Holyoke. 
 He's been dead for a century. 
 Garrett : If you followed the trail this far, you've come to understand the same things about that place as I did." 
 Help me! 
 It's okay. They can't hurt you anymore. 
 You killed him and Dave and Cricket. 
 We had nothing to do with them. 
 You're lying to me. Just like you lied to Damon.

 That's my baby girl. 
 Renée : Now, I'm worried about you, Jessie. 
 You haven't been taking my calls. 
 I've been busy. 
 Well, you got that court date coming up. 
 I just want to make sure you're okay. 
 I'm fine, mom. 
 You know I'm just looking out for you. 
 What happened to my sweet baby girl? 
 Hey. 
 Deb wants to talk to us. 
 Okay, just a sec. 
 I got to go, mom. 
 Hi, Amy, Jessie, welcome. 
 Okay. 
 I just got off the phone with the state police. 
 State police? What about Garrett? 
 Deputy Sykes is under investigation but only until they have finished the report about what happened here. 
 What they have determined for sure... 
 Is that Stillwater sucks at vetting sheriffs? 
 ...is that everyone involved in the terrible things that happened here is dead. 
 It's over. 
 We don't have to be afraid anymore. 
 It's because of you. 
 Sykes never would have busted those guys if you hadn't drawn them out. 
 He's right. 
 The way that you all have come together, the way that you have become a family, in spite of everything, it's been incredible to watch. 
 Which makes it even harder to say goodbye. 
 What are you talking about? 
 I'm shutting camp down. 
 What? 
 The, um, authorities have given me 48 hours before they release the story to the media. 
 After that, the camp will be filled with cops and reporters. 
 You won't even recognize this place, and I want to protect the kids from that. 
 The bus will take a day to get here, so we have 24 hours to get the kids ready and packed up to go home. 
 I wanted to give you the best summer ever. 
 I... I'm so sorry. 
 Wait. We can't leave like this. 
 If this has to be our last day, it deserve to be special. 
 We owe it to the kids. 
 And we owe it to each other. 
 It's pretty cool, huh? 
 How quickly a place can feel like home. 
 It's amazing. 
 Yeah. 
 I know that we kind of started off on the wrong foot this summer, but... 
 I just wanted to say thank you... for saving my life. 
 You're welcome. 
 But Garrett really deserves the credit, on the life-saving front. 
 You really care about him, don't you? 
 You know, you should do something about it, while there's still time. 
 Joel : Hey, guys! 
 [Heart beating] 
 [Gasps] 
 [Gasps] 
 Do not turn around. 
 No matter what you hear or feel. 
 Look at me. 
 Jessie, listen to me. 
 It's not over. It's awakening. 
 You have to put Holyoke's bones in the lake, or everyone will die. 
 Holyoke's bones?! 
 Do it before sundown, or it'll be too late. 
 They'll try and convince you it's a trick. 
 Don't listen to them. 
 Only trust yourself. 
 Only you can do this, Jessie. 
 It's the only way to end this. 
 [Demon growling] 
 Wait. Why me?! 
 Cricket?! 
 Cricket! 
 Did you see...? 
 That was nuts! 
 How did we not know that there was an eclipse coming? 
 It was so beautiful. 
 It's like Stillwater's saying goodbye. 
 Today, we are gonna play one of our favorite games... 
 Blind Man's Bluff. 
 Yes! 
 [Cheers and applause] 
 And Jessie's up first. 
 All right, ready? 
 All : 1, 2, 3. 
 Hide. Hide, hide. 
 Okay. 
 And... Wait, wait, wait! 
 Forward. 
 Forward, forward, forward, forward, forward! 
 And forward! Ooh! So close. 
 To your left. 
 [Voices whispering] 
 [Heart beating] 
 Jessie, Jessie. 
 Jessie, what is it? 
 You've been acting different ever since the eclipse. 
 Whatever is going on, you can tell me. 
 You can trust me, Jessie. 
 [Laughter] 
 I saw something. 
 Something? 
 [Sighs] 
 Cricket. She talked to me. 
 She said the cops are wrong and it's not over. 
 What else did she say? 
 She told me I have to put Holyoke's bones in the lake. 
 And that if I didn't do it... 
 [Sighs] 
 ...everyone was going to die. 
 That doesn't sound like Cricket. 
 It sounds like Holyoke trying to trick you. 
 If Cricket was going to contact someone, don't you think she would have contacted Blair? 
 He was her best friend. 
 It really felt like her, Amy. 
 I'm sure it did. 
 But if there's one thing this place has taught me, it's that the only people we can trust are each other. 
 [Oran Juice Jones' "Rain" plays] 
 [Sighs] "Northwestern has an unparalleled faculty and a creative, passionate student body. 
 That's why I think your campus is the perfect place for me to explore my academic interests." 
 Hey, college girl. 
 I got you a present. 
 Wow, mom. That's... 
 I got it for your big day tomorrow. 
 You know, 'cause I figured, if it looks good on me, it'll look even better on you. 
 A little revealing for an interview, don't you think? 
 Nothing wrong with revealing if you got something to reveal. 
 [Laughing] I don't think that's on their admissions checklist, mom. 
 Well, every little bit helps. Trust me on that. 
 [Siren wails in distance] 
 Thanks. I love it. 
 But I got to go to work. 
 Don't forget you're driving me in the morning. 
 We have to leave by 8:30 at the latest. 
 Do you really think I'd forget on the biggest day of my baby's life? 
 I love you, Mom. 
 Will you hang the dress up in my closet? 
 Actually, uh, do you mind if I wear it tonight? 
 'Cause Carl's taking me out. 
 Ugh. Carl. Really? 
 Yeah. Look, I know he's not perfect, but I don't want to be by myself when you go off to college. 
 Mom, it's Evanston. 
 It's not like I'm moving to Paris. 
 I know. I'm just gonna miss you. That's all. 
 I won't be far. 
 See you at 8:30? 
 I'll see you at 8:00. 
 We can pick up some breakfast on the drive over. 
 You don't have to do that. 
 But I want to. 
 Don't I always take care of my baby? 
 Yes. 
 Okay. 
 See you tomorrow.

 Look, when you first came here, I told you that I'd show you around, and the offer still stands. 
 You know, if there's anything that you want to squeeze in before... you know... 
 All your memories here don't have to be bad. 
 Thanks, Alex. 
 [Grunts] 
 Oh! 
 I got it! 
 Sorry! 
 Joel... we need to talk. 
 About what? 
 Jessie. 
 I think Holyoke is trying to trick her. 
 Same way he did you. 
 Yeah, I knew this wasn't over. 
 We need to look after her. 
 Make sure she knows who she can trust before she does something she regrets. 
 Are you okay? 
 Deb said you were under investigation. 
 Just until I'm cleared. 
 Of what? 
 Heelan. 
 But... 
 Killing him was the hardest thing I've ever done. 
 Even after everything he did, I still... 
 And the worst part is, before I shot him, he told me they didn't kill Dave. 
 Or Cricket. 
 He told me it was someone else. 
 He was trying to get in your head. 
 Yeah, well, it worked. 
 And the only reason why I pulled that trigger? 
 Because I thought that would be the end. 
 But now I know it isn't. 
 Why do you say that? 
 You saw the eclipse, right? 
 Yeah. 
 There wasn't supposed to be one today. 
 And according to my dad's notes, that's a sign. 
 Of what? 
 That a demon has been awoken. 
 Inside a vessel. 
 A vessel? 
 Amy. 
 The ritual they were doing in that cave... 
 I think I was too late to stop it. 
 You mean Amy is possessed. 
 Look, I know it sounds all crazy, but there's something bigger at play here. 
 If the eclipse happens, something terrible... 
 Truly terrible... Is on the horizon. 
 And there's only one way to stop it. 
 It's by killing the vessel. 
 I hope you're not saying what I think you're saying. 
 Look, all I have to go on is what my dad wrote in his journal, and so far, he hasn't been wrong... 
 About anything. 
 So, no, I'm not seriously standing here telling you I want to kill Amy, but I do want to end this. 
 And right now... 
 I don't know any other way. 
 I think I do. 
 [Clock ticking] 
 I am so, so sorry. My ride was late. 
 And I know that that's my responsibility... 
 I'm sorry, too, Miss Tyler, but you're almost an hour late. 
 I have to go. 
 No, please, sir, just give me 10 minutes. 
 So, you're saying you want to steal the bones of a man who's been dead over a century, dump them in the lake, and that will end all this? 
 Yes. You've got to trust me. 
 The state police said they found a skeleton in the trunk of Damon's car. 
 It matches to the skull we dug up. 
 They used it as part of their ritual. 
 They dug him up. 
 We have to bury him and end this. 
 [Branches rustle] 
 What brings you to camp, Deputy? 
 I was just... checking in. 
 Wanted to make sure Amy was okay. 
 She's, um... fine. 
 Pretty incredible under the circumstances. 
 That's... That's terrific. 
 Yeah. 
 Are you sure that everything's all right? 
 Like I said, just checking in. 
 This eclipse... there was, uh... one back in 1970. 
 I completely forgot until today. 
 It's all got me a bit uneasy. 
 Let me know if there's anything I can do. 
 Thank you. 
 We need to act now. 
 The sun's gonna be down in a few hours... 
 There's no way the state police are letting me in the morgue. 
 So create a diversion, and I'll go. 
 Just like old times. 
 [Thunder crashes] 
 Joel, what are you doing down here, man? 
 I've been looking all over for you. 
 What's going on? 
 What's going on? 
 Hey, get out of my way, man. 
 It's Holyoke! 
 He contacted Jessie. He's still out there. 
 Yeah, and we're leaving camp tomorrow. 
 You think that'll stop him? 
 He followed my brother home. 
 He will never leave us alone until I end this. 
 How are you gonna do that? 
 By burning down the cabin. 
 Hey! 
 Holyoke is already dead, remember? 
 What the hell is burning down a cabin gonna do? 
 That's where he first appeared to all of us. 
 That's where he was at his strongest. 
 Maybe the cabin is like a portal or a bridge to this world. 
 Joel... you're talking crazy, man. 
 You don't have to help me. 
 Just stay the hell out of my way. 
 You got something to say, say it to me! 
 
 
 
 [Door hinges creaking] 
 [Door hinges creaking] 
 [Gasps] 
 [Grunt ] 
 [Clatter] 
 [Rattling] 
 [Sighs] Come on, Jessie. Focus. 
 [Growling] 
 [Heart beating] 
 [Electricity crackles] 
 [Gasps] 
 You can't stop what's coming. 
 Cricket :  They'll try to trick you. 
 [Renée's voice] I'm just looking out for what's best for you, baby. 
 Don't listen, Jessie. Trust yourself. 
 [Normal voice] That changes nothing. 
 Malphas is here. Malphas is rising! 
 [Door closes] 
 Jessie, Amy told me what you're gonna do. 
 Don't do it. 
 Joel, you have no idea... 
 Can't you tell Holyoke's messing with you? 
 If you do what he says, you're going to help him resurrect the thing you think you're stopping. 
 What are you talking about? 
 The demon. 
 Its name is Malphas. 
 "He is the great prince of Hell. 
 He will fool you with good familiar spirits and use them to betray you." 
 Heelan, Damon... They failed. 
 But that demon still wants to come back. 
 And Holyoke will do anything in his power to help awaken it. 
 That's just it. 
 I think that Malphas may have already awoken. 
 In a vessel. 
 What vessel? 
 Back in the olden days, there was a large rock. 
 I know it sounds insane, Joel, but everything I've learned from these notes so far has been true. 
 No. You can't just say something like that without proof. 
 The eclipse was the proof. 
 It's not like there's a test to prove if someone's a demon. 
 Actually, take a look at this. 
 "A demon must respond to its true name. 
 When presented with holy symbols, it will cause them pain." 
 Where'd you even get this book? 
 It's a long story. 
 We have to do this. 
 If Amy is possessed, then this is how we'll know you're right. 
 But we have to do it now, before sundown. 
 What's wrong, guys? Why all the secrecy? 
 We just want to talk to you, Amy. 
 Make sure you're feeling okay. 
 Last night was... 
 It was pretty traumatic. 
 It was. 
 But I'm fine now. 
 Good. That's good. 
 Amy, I need to ask you something. 
 When you were in that cave... did you hear anyone say the word "Malphas?" 
 What did you say? 
 Malphas... is the name of the demon those psychos were trying to raise. 
 No, I... I didn't hear it. 
 The last thing you need is to reopen old wounds. 
 Which is why I think you should have this. 
 Why are you giving that to me? 
 It was my mom's. 
 She gave it to me to wear for protection. 
 I just think you need it more than me. 
 I... I really can't take that. 
 We insist. 
 Thank you. 
 A demon test? Are you serious? 
 Garrett, what is he talking about? 
 Joel : I told you to stay out of it. 
 They think you're possessed, and they're testing you. 
 What? 
 That isn't true, right, Garrett? 
 Jessie? 
 Especially after everything that she's been through. 
 I trusted you guys. 
 [Gasps] 
 We were wrong. 
 It's not in Amy. This is all a trick. 
 That's what it wants you to think. 
 You have to trust yourself. 
 You're the trick. 
 No, you have to believe me. 
 [Heart beating] 
 Jessie, don't look. 
 [Gasps] 
 That is what's coming. 
 And if you don't put the bones in the lake by sundown, everyone will die. 
 Baby, I'm so sorry. 
 Carl and I were out, and then one thing led to another and... 
 I know how important today was to you. 
 You probably hate me, don't you? 
 Mom... 
 You should. 
 'Cause you are too good to me. 
 Mom. 
 They said I'm a perfect fit. 
 Wait. What now? 
 The admissions rep. 
 He said that if I stay on track, I'll be in Evanston in the fall. 
 Mom, this is huge! 
 Oh, that's... that's... 
 Mom, don't be sad. 
 Mom, I'm going to college! My dream school. 
 No, I'm not sad, baby. I'm... I'm happy! 
 It's just... It's just so... 
 [Laughs] 
 My baby's going to college. 
 My baby's going to college! 
 [Both laugh] 
 Well, let's celebrate. 
 Okay. Yeah. 
 Let's go! 
 What's in the bag? 
 I don't want to talk about it. 
 You know you can trust me, whatever this is, right? 
 Doesn't feel like I can trust anyone anymore. 
 Yeah, I know that feeling. 
 I was in that exact same boat when I first got here. 
 So what changed? 
 Honestly? 
 You. 
 Knowing I could trust you made me think about everything completely differently. 
 Just listen to yourself, to that voice in your head. 
 If you can trust that, you're on the right track. 
 Hey. 
 Hey. 
 You okay? 
 I just wanted to thank you for sticking up for me. 
 Yeah. 
 They probably just... 
 I don't know. 
 I don't know what they were thinking. 
 I think they're scared, and they don't know who to trust. 
 So does the offer still stand? 
 Show me around before we have to go? 
 Yeah. Of course. 
 What'd you have in mind? 
 I heard Eagle Creek was beautiful. 
 Mm. 
 I know it's Stillwater tradition to hike out there. 
 Well, tradition calls, and we should definitely do it. 
 Deb? 
 I want to know what's going on. 
 Why is Sykes really here? 
 Uh, he... 
 I just think he's confused. 
 He wants to make sure everything is really over. 
 I was wondering the same thing. 
 What do you mean? 
 This eclipse, I think it unlocked something. 
 I think some things happened at this camp, back in 1970, things that I... I forgot or maybe I tried to forget, and I have seen some things this summer, things that... scared me... things that I wasn't prepared to see. 
 I think we've all had strange experiences this summer. 
 But we get to choose which memories we take with us. 
 Right? 
 Yeah. 
 Uh, I'm gonna show her Eagle Creek. 
 It's the last day of camp, and she's never seen it before. 
 It's beautiful there. 
 Joel : Jessie. 
 Jessie! What the hell are you doing? 
 Jessie! 
 Joel, leave her alone! 
 It's a trick. 
 Trust me. 
 No. Trust me! 
 You don't know what you're doing. 
 Hey, let go of me. 
 What the hell is going on? 
 Where are we? 
 I don't know. 
 They can't see us. 
 Do not be afraid, my brothers and sisters. 
 Step across. 
 [Water splashing] 
 No! 
 Stop! It's a purification! 
 No! 
 The militia will be here soon, and they will believe you did this.

 Jessie. 
 We have to see this through. 
 Whatever it is. 
 I don't understand. 
 What are we doing here? 
 You left me no other choice. 
 You had to see it for yourself. 
 See what? 
 The truth. 
 My brother killed himself because of you. 
 What you think you know you do not. 
 The time has come for the two of you to stop fighting. 
 You must work together. 
 Because I am going to need you. 
 Find Amy. 
 The demon lives within her. 
 No, she passed the test. 
 The demon is a master of deception. 
 You're going to kill her. 
 No. 
 I am going to save her. 
 [Horse whinnies] 
 [Indistinct shouting] 
 Let no harm come to her. 
 That will only empower the demon.

 [Indistinct shouting] 
 Garrett : Jessie. Jessie! 
 Joel, what's going on? 
 It's like you guys were in a trance. 
 We were wrong. 
 About what? 
 Holyoke. 
 He's not what you think. 
 He's good. 
 And he's the only one who can help us. 
 Help us what? 
 Save Amy. 
 Jessie, you can't trust what Holyoke told you. 
 We tested Amy. She passed, remember? 
 No, she tricked us. 
 You have to trust me, Garrett. 
 And I'm telling you, we need to save her while there's still time. 
 Save her from what? 
 No more lies. 
 Amy... needs help. 
 Help? What kind of help? 
 Something... Something has taken ahold of her, something bad. 
 I need you to take care of the kids while we go find her. 
 She's at Eagle Creek with Alex, and I'm going with you. 
 Are you sure? 
 Yes. Why? 
 Eagle Creek is the fifth point. 
 What does that mean? 
 It means someone's going to die there if we don't hurry. 
 What's wrong? 
 [Sighs] 
 Last time I was supposed to stargaze... was with Cricket.

 Well, who's gonna take care of me when you're gone? 
 Did you ever think about that? 
 Mom, I spent my whole life taking care of you. 
 I thought you were happy for me. 
 I didn't think you'd ever actually do it. 
 So you never believed in me? 
 Ugh. 
 What'd you think I was doing working a fryer for two years, saving every penny? 
 So, what, you were just humoring me?

 [Renée's voice] It's your turn, baby girl. 
 It's your turn. 
 [Gun cocks] 
 Garrett, no. We can't hurt her. 
 She killed Joel. 
 We have to save her. We can't... 
 No! 
 [Body thuds] 
 Aah! [Screaming] 
 [Normal voice] Let go of me! 
 [Grunting] 
 You know where to go! 
 I have to get the kids out of here. 
 Right now. 
 Joel... 
 I'm so sorry. 
 But we can still save Amy. 
 Come on. Follow me. 
 [Amy screams] 
 [Grunting] 
 Let us... begin. 
 [Lock engages] 
 [Distorted screaming]
