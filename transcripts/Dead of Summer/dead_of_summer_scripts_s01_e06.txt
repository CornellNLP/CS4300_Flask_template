 Previously on "Dead of Summer"... 
 Oh, my God! 
 "Dharma Bums"? 
 It was given to me by someone I loved very much. 
 Last night, I saw these people... down by the lake. 
 They were wearing these masks. 
 Jack Sykes. This belonged to my father. 
 He was doing the same thing we are. 
 You should keep your eyes open. 
 'Cause bear traps aren't the only thing we should be worried about. 
 Whoa. 
 Where's your camera? 
 It doesn't work here. 
 Kill Amy, or someone else will die. 
 So you're gonna go meet him? 
 Gotta give it a shot.

 [Sighs] Are we really doing this? 
 What, are you kidding? 
 Kerouac and Ginsburg buried one under a bar in San Francisco. 
 [Chuckling] But nobody really knows which one. 
 [Laughs] 
 Not even them. 
 Our own personal time capsule. 
 "Deb, it's never too late to be the person you were always meant to be." 
 I don't know if I can part with this. 
 There's no choice. We have to. 
 Look, if you keep it, you might lose it. 
 This way, if we ever want this summer back, we'll know exactly where to find it.

 You see that? 
 Mm‐hmm. 
 That's Canis Major. 
 That's Orion's pet dog. 
 He's chasing her. 
 Who's that? 
 Oh, that's Hare. 
 See, Hare, she's always on the run. 
 Always searching for her one true love. 
 But Orion's dog, he's not hunting her to kill her. 
 He loves her. He is her one true love. 
 She just doesn't know it yet. 
 I can't believe it's the last night of camp. 
 And then... it's over. 
 Three weeks [sighs] college. 
 Come with me. 
 What? 
 I'm going to travel the world. 
 We'll go everywhere, see everything. 
 What, so I get to be sidekick while you write novels and become the next Richard Brautigan. 
 Well, if I can, yeah. [Chuckles] 
 Let's do it together. 
 That sounds great. 
 But you want to see the world, Keith. 
 I think I'm going to try and save it. 
 You have to promise to send me a postcard from everywhere you go. 
 Let's promise each other we'll never stop being the Dharma Bums. 
 We'll never give up on our dreams, okay? 
 It's not like you're gonna be gone forever, right? 
 Stay sharp, kid. 
 You never know when I might come walking through the door.

 So, um... take care of each other. 
 Thanks.

 [Engine starts] 
 How you holding up? 
 Um... 
 Better than them. 
 Deputy Sykes wanted me to tell you that... he's done taking statements. 
 I guess they're ruling it a... accident, but... 
 Of course it was. 
 This was all my fault. 
 I had a perfect summer 19 years ago. 
 I wanted that for all of you. 
 But it was a mistake to reopen this camp. 
 No, you did the right thing. 
 Yeah. 
 It was. 
 If I had left the past the past, Cricket would still be alive. 
 Hello? 
 [Light creaking] 
 [Door creaks] 
 [Gasps] 
 [Laughs] 
 I told you to stay sharp, kid. 
 Keith. 
 [Chuckles, sighs] 
 I can't believe you dug this up without me. 
 Long time no see, Dharma Bum. 
 [Birds chirping] 
 Have you said anything to him? 
 Well, maybe you should. 
 He could really use a friend right now. 
 Kind of burned that bridge. 
 So fix it. 
 Cricket... always knew when I was feeling down. 
 She'd bring me peanut butter cups. 
 I know it sounds dumb, but... 
 I would give anything to share one with her right now. 
 Man : You know, it doesn't make sense. 
 Alex : Cricket loved to overnight. She loved these woods. 
 She knew where to walk, where not to walk. 
 She stopped me from stepping in the trap that afternoon. 
 She was coming to meet me. 
 Holyoke told me that if I didn't do what he told me to do, that someone else was going to die. 
 So, what, you're saying that you pissed off a ghost and  he  killed her? 
 I knew I should have just kept my mouth shut. 
 What happened to Cricket was an accident. 
 I just wish there was some way we could find out for sure. 
 [Grunts] 
 You're sure it's down here? 
 Yeah. 
 Why so surprised? 
 The camp hasn't been open in six years. 
 They had to put it somewhere. 
 Oh, there it is... in the box. 
 Uh... 
 [Wind howls] 
 [Door slams] 
 You sure about this? 
 Maybe it's a sign that we shouldn't be here. 
 Or... maybe it's a sign that se should. 
 ♪ ♪ 
 We're going to talk to Cricket. 
 This is a horrible idea. 
 Cricket is dead and you're turning this into some stupid slumber party game. 
 It's not a game, it's real. 
 Look, my... my abuelita was a Santera. 
 Joel : You guys can do what you want. 
 I'm not doing that... that's voodoo. 
 Santeria is a religion. 
 Right. 
 She knew how to talk to the other side, and she taught me. 
 What do you think you're gonna hear? 
 The truth. 
 If someone did this to her, I want some revenge. 
 No, we can't do this. 
 If this is real and some spirit killed her, it could kill all of us. 
 Do you guys hear yourselves? 
 Look... nothing is going to hurt us. 
 We're going to talk to Cricket, and that's it. 
 So after lights out when the campers go to sleep, we meet here and we find out what happened. 
 You really believe this? 
 I have to believe this. 
 I didn't get to say goodbye, Jessie. 
 Jessie : Okay. 
 After lights out. 
 So... [Chuckles] 
 You finally left Fred. 
 This can't be happening. 
 Oh, come on, Dharma Bum. 
 [Sighs] 
 You can't tell me... that I haven't been on your mind. 
 Of course you've been on my mind. 
 You're the whole reason that I'm here. 
 I thought... if I could come back, maybe I could... recreate the magic, but... we were... the Dharma Bums... one summer a long time ago, and you have no idea how badly I screwed up. 
 [Sniffles] 
 Well, let's make it better. 
 Hmm? 
 Mm‐hmm. 
 Let's go into the woods. 
 Find our old spot. 
 [Chuckles] 
 We have some unfinished business, you and I. 
 [Sighs] 
 I can't. 
 The last time you asked me to come with you, you broke my heart. 
 Why do you have to come back now... when it's too late? 
 No. 
 No, it's never too late to become the person you were always meant to be. 
 You remember that? 
 Right? 
 [Sniffles] The person I am now has a... a lot of responsibilities. 
 A lot has happened in the last 24 hours, and I need you to leave. 
 All right. 
 If you change your mind, you know where to find me. 
 And don't wait too long. 
 I'm only here tonight, then I have to go. 
 [Chatter] 
 [Siren wails] 
 Thank you. 
 Thank you. 
 Who's the fox? 
 Oh. Just an old friend. 
 My ass! Guys who look like that aren't friends. 
 Who is he? 
 Well... 
 Okay, if you must know, we had a pretty intense summer together right before college. 
 But now he's traveling the world and writing poetry. 
 Soul mate? 
 I haven't seen him in years. 
 Avoiding the question, counselor. 
 Damn right. [Chuckles] 
 Excuse me. 
 Sir, I would like to get your signature for the Children's Defense League. 
 We are petitioning Congress for the Safe Families Act. 
 Yeah, I know what you're doing here. 
 I've seen you out here for the past three days. 
 [Sighs] 
 We've even had a few clients complain about it. 
 Oh. Well, we're a hundred feet from the building's entrance, and we're not breaking any laws. 
 And the sooner we get signatures on all of these pages, the sooner we'll be gone. 
 You know, standing out on the street corner, bugging people for signatures isn't gonna change things, right? 
 Hmm. 
 See that building right there? 
 Mason, Morrow & Finch... wall to wall Harvard lawyers. 
 That's how you change things. 
 The act of one person on behalf of another can change the world. 
 That's heavy, man. [Chuckles] 
 You get that off a bumper sticker? 
 "Streetlight 49," Keith Jones. 
 And as a matter of fact, I am a Harvard lawyer. 
 Really? 
 Really. 
 What did you think of Professor Hartman? 
 Barfman? Brilliant mind, terrible breath. 
 [Chuckles] 
 I'll make you a deal. 
 I'll sign your petition if you'll give me your phone number. 
 Hmm. That is not a very original line. 
 I get that every day. 
 Did it work this time? 
 We'll see. 
 Oh. 
 We'll see. 
 Yeah. 
 You find anything, kiddo? 
 [Sighs] 
 Are you sure this is all Dad's things? 
 I mean, he didn't have any other files? 
 That's it, baby. 
 [Sighs] 
 You have any idea why Dad was looking into this stuff? 
 Oh, honey. 
 Solving a case, even one that your dad was working on, is not gonna bring him back, you know. 
 I know that, Mom. 
 Garrett, the hard truth is the quicker people leave us, the longer it takes to say goodbye. 
 How can I say goodbye... when he keeps showing up? 
 Ohh. Is this... 
 I found this in an old cabin. 
 Dad was there, looking through the exact same evidence as me. 
 No, that makes no sense. 
 Mom, I'm telling you. 
 Garrett, your dad was a number of things, but sloppy is not one of them. 
 There's no say he would leave something like that behind. 
 Not without good reason. 
 What are you talking about? 
 What is that? 
 It's a file number. 
 Dad knew somebody else would come looking, and he left this behind to point them exactly where to go. 
 Well, what do you think is there? 
 I don't know. 
 But I'm guessing whatever it is is what got him killed.

 [Chuckles] 
 "Please say yes. 
 Or are you too busy saving the world?" 
 [Knock on door] 
 Wow. 
 [Wolf whistles] 
 Is it my imagination, or did becoming a partner somehow make you even hotter? 
 Well, it's gotta be your imagination. 
 No. 
 It's not my imagination.

 Oh, it's a promotion, huh?

 Of course.

 Don't mock it, Alex. 
 I mean, this is the way to make a doorway between worlds. 
 Blair, this is really starting to creep me out. 
 [Light switch clicks] 
 What are you two doing in here. 
 Uh, we're just grabbing a snack. 
 The old spirit board? 
 What we're doing here is none of your business. 
 Actually, it is my business, Blair. 
 I'm camp director. And... 
 And what? 
 I mean, all you've done is shut down camp for a day. 
 No activities, just letting people sit around and be sad. 
 At least I'm doing something. 
 I am your boss. You have to listen to me. 
 No. What, do you want to fire me? 
 Go ahead. 
 Blair. 
 Go back to your cabin... and I'll speak with you in the morning. 
 Yeah. Maybe we should... 
 No, screw that! 
 I'm tired of taking orders from someone who obviously doesn't know what the hell she's doing. 
 Taxi! 
 Sorry. 
 Thanks a lot. Oof! 
 I'm sorry. 
 I'm so sorry. 
 No, I... 
 Oh, my God! 
 Ha! 
 Well, I always told you to stay sharp, kid. 
 How's your writing going? 
 Oh. 
 You know, a lot of the old magazines, they're shutting down. So it's... 
 [Sighs] 
 [Sniffs] 
 If you really want to know the truth, um... 
 [Sighs] 
 That poem that I sent you... was the last time that I got published. 
 Well, that's crazy. Your work is beautiful. 
 You know, you should collect all the postcards that you wrote me and... and put them in a book. 
 Yeah. 
 Yeah. 
 Well, I didn't make copies, so... 
 Well, I saved them. 
 Hmm. 
 How's Fred? 
 Fred. 
 Fred is... we work a lot, and we're living the yuppie dream. 
 What happened to us? 
 We were the Dharma Bums, and we... we were gonna save the world. 
 Yeah, well, I guess the world changed us. 
 Didn't it? 
 Was that summer at camp the best it's gonna be? 
 Well... 
 [Clears throat] 
 If we ever want to go back to that summer, we know exactly where to find it, don't we? 
 Oh! 
 Huh? 
 The time capsule. 
 Yes. 
 [Sighs] 
 You got three hours? 
 [Laughs] 
 We could drive up there right now and dig it up. 
 I'm serious. 
 No, I know. 
 But I know what we are now. 
 We're the creepy adults who, like, show up, and the kids are like, "Why are they here?" 
 No. There aren't any kids there. 
 What? 
 The camp's been closed for years. 
 You didn't know that? It's true. 
 Come on. 
 Are you in? 
 Let's do this. Come on. 
 Come on, come on, come on. 
 No, I can't. I need to get home. 
 [Clears throat] 
 [Keys jingle] 
 Deb, I really need this. 
 [Clears throat] Look... I'm only here tonight. I... I leave in the morning. So... [Clears throat] If you change your mind... you know where to find me, right?

 Do you remember a kid named Polly? 
 [Laughs] 
 Right? 
 Yeah. [Laughs] 
 The one that got flu, like, on the first day of camp, and she was so upset that all the other kids were swimming and running around. 
 She was stuck in bed. 
 And you... you stayed with her. 
 You were playing cards and painting her fingernails, if I remember. 
 We talked about her parents' divorce. 
 Yeah. 
 She ended up having a great time because of you. 
 I ended up getting the flu. [Chuckles] 
 Oh, God. You were always the heart of the camp. 
 Yeah. 
 You still are, you know? 
 Those were days were... the best. 
 Yeah. 
 Yeah. 
 Those days are gone. 
 Forever. 
 Maybe they're just beginning. 
 Okay. 
 These three candles represent light. 
 And... according to my abuelita, the white roses draw in the spirits. 
 What is this for? 
 Sometimes spirits can communicate using writing. 
 Dear spirits of kindness and light, we invite you to join us here tonight to speak your thoughts and wishes as openly as you desire. 
 We banish forces of darkness and evil. 
 Blair... don't do this. 
 Everyone hold hands. 
 Blair, maybe we should... 
 Quiet. Concentrate. 
 Are you sure we should be doing this? 
 We are doing this.

 If you wish to communicate with us, please, give us a sign. 
 Cricket, please.

 Who pushed you?! 
 Cricket, where are you? 
 Are you okay?! 
 Oh, no! He's coming! 
 He's so close! I have to go! 
 Cricket! 
 Blair! 
 Blair?! 
 I'm here! 
 [Growls] 
 [Gasps] 
 [Masculine voice] You should have killed Amy when you had the chance. 
 She is the doorway! Kill her! 
 Kill her! 
 Kill her now!

 Amen. 
 [All panting]

 [Blair panting] 
 What happened? 
 Jessie? 
 Are you okay? 
 Jessie! 
 [Ghostly snarl] 
 What's happening? 
 Help! 
 [Mystical chanting] 
 Show me that it's all real. It's all real. 
 I didn't draw that! I don't know how to draw! 
 Jess, come on, relax. 
 Seriously? 
 Did you not just see what happened to me? 
 To Amy? She was possessed! 
 Blair : It was Cricket. 
 But then it was... it was someone else. 
 Someone else? What happened to me? 
 We woke something up. 
 Something bad. 
 Holyoke. 
 What? 
 Blair, I told you not to... 
 It was supposed to be Cricket. 
 Alex : Yeah, well, it wasn't. 
 You said you knew what you were doing. 
 Leave him alone, Alex. 
 Oh, I'm sorry, Drew. 
 Did you miss the part where Amy tried to stab herself? 
 Hey! 
 Everybody calm down. 
 What happened tonight was awful and weird. 
 But now we know some things. 
 Drew : Like what? 
 Your stupid movies aren't nearly as screwed up as all this? 
 Like that all this is real, and we have to deal with it... no matter how crazy it seems. 
 Holyoke still has his sights on Amy. 
 What did he mean when he said she was the doorway? 
 I don't know. 
 Then I'm getting help. 
 I'm gonna call Sykes. 
 Jessie... 
 I'll cover your cabin. 
 Thanks. 
 [Laughing] 
 Okay, wow. 
 This is... this is not how I pictured this night going. 
 That's funny. 
 'Cause, you know, this is exactly how I... pictured this going. 
 [Laughs] 
 [Laughs] 
 This is, um... 
 This is what I wanted... that day I‐I bumped into you. 
 You and me here... forever, just... just like this. 
 You know that I can't stay, right? 
 No. 
 Actually, I... I don't. 
 I don't know that. Not after this. 
 [Sighs] 
 I'm sorry, Deb. 
 I wasn't lying when I said that I had to leave. 
 Hey. 
 Keith! 
 [Scoffs, Laughs] 
 Are you kidding? 
 Keith? 
 Hey, come back! 
 Keith! 
 Who's there? 
 What are you doing? 
 What's going on at camp? 
 Are you okay? 
 No. 
 Now tell me everything. 
 I found a notebook that belonged to my dad. 
 He was looking into the exact same things that are going on at camp now... satanic rituals... just before he got killed. 
 You mean this is happening he... here? 
 According to this, they would have buried a lock of hair, a deer heart, and a skull for the ceremony to be complete. 
 So I went out there and started digging. 
 Nothing. 
 Which means they weren't doing this ritual, which means my theories are crap, which means I'm an idiot. 
 So, why are you out here? 
 Because you're not an idiot. Something is happening there. 
 I didn't believe it, but... 
 Where'd this come from? 
 [Sighs] We... did a seance tonight. 
 What? 
 Just... just don't. 
 I passed out, and when I woke up, I was drawing this. 
 You sure you weren't drunk or something? 
 Garrett. Look. 
 That's not even my handwriting. 
 Who did this? Who made that map? 
 [Voice breaking] What's happening to me? 
 What... what happened to Cricket? 
 I don't know. Just... 
 Can you turn the lights on, please? 
 I think I know where they buried the skull. 
 Keith! 
 Where are you?! 
 Where are you?! 
 You shouldn't have followed me. 
 I can't lose you. 
 Not again.

 There is nothing here for me now. 
 It's not your fault. 
 It's not your fault what happened to Cricket. 
 You don't control everything, Deb. 
 [Chuckles] 
 I should have protected her. 
 What happened to her can't be undone. 
 But there are other kids here that are gonna need your help, and they're gonna need it soon. 
 You have to stay here for them. 
 [Chuckles] 
 I can't. 
 Not without you. 
 Yes, you can. 
 That's why you left Fred. 
 That's why you're here, not because of me. 
 Because of you. 
 You came back here to finally be what you were always meant to be. 
 Will I see you again? 
 Whenever you need me. 
 You'll know just where to find me. 
 Stay sharp, kid. 
 There's more things coming. 
 Dark things. 
 Maybe you didn't save the world... but you might just be able to save these kids. 
 [Engine shuts off] 
 [Birds chirping] 
 I'm sorry, Keith. 
 I know this is what you wanted me to do, but... it wasn't supposed to be like this. 
 You were supposed to be here, too. 
 We were supposed to be here together. 
 [Sign taps] 
 What happened to Cricket hurt all of us. 
 But instead of being here for you, I hid. 
 And if some of you are thinking... or saying that I'm not doing my job... 
 I understand that. 
 But at Camp Stillwater, we look out for each other. 
 We all have broken hearts. 
 But maybe trying to talk to the ghost of a person we miss the most isn't the best way to remember them. 
 If we're looking for Cricket, we don't need to look out there, we need to look inside ourselves. 
 This summer will always be a special summer, because it is the one that holds the last memories of Cricket. 
 [Sniffles] 
 I'm sorry. 
 I'm sorry, too. 
 [Shovels clangs] 
 [Gasps] Oh, my God! 
 [Clanging] 
 [Hinges creak] 
 [Gasps] 
 [Shudders] 
 Garrett? 
 Jess, look. 
 That's where Dave's body was found, right? 
 Right where it says "1." 
 And that's where we found Cricket. 
 That's 3. 
 What do you think we'll find if we look there? 
 We're about there. 
 Here? 
 Yeah. 
 What the? 
 It's blood. 
 Something was buried here. 
 Or someone. 
 But whoever did it... 
 They came back and moved it. 
 Which means they know we're onto them. 
 Did they find it? 
 No. 
 Someone moved it. 
 Who? 
 The same person that's been helping us all along. 
 Yeah, well, we still don't know who they are. 
 No, but whoever it is, the teacher says we should thank them... for showing us what a true believer really is. 
 Garrett : It's number 4. 
 They're going to kill again.
