 Previously on  "Dead of Summer"... 
 Let's go! 
 All that crap written on the walls, that's not you. 
 You only want him 'cause you can't have him. 
 We have a connection. 
 Deb? I don't get it. 
 Staff week, she was flirty, and now it's like she flipped a switch. 
 Ah, little light reading there, Deputy? 
 Garrett : Found it gutted up at the camp the other day. 
 The heart ripped out. 
 You think because I'm wearing this... that I'm a devil worshiper. 
 I want you packed up and gone by 9:00 a.m. 
 Gonna miss you in Cabin 10, buddy. 
 You dosed me. 
 Oh, my God. 
 [Water dripping] 
 [Eerie music plays] 
 [Door opens, closes] 
 Hello? 
 Someone there? 
 [Animals calling, crickets chirping] 
 [Twig snaps] 
 Hello? 
 ♪ ♪ 
 Man on TV :  It doesn't matter if you believe in Satan. 
 It doesn't matter if you believe in demons. 
 What's important is to know there are people out there who do, and they are willing to do anything to accomplish their goals. [TV shuts off] They say teenagers are more likely to get wrapped up in it. I heard about this one girl. They made her drink goat's blood. Ew, Mom. Can you maybe hold the goat's-blood talk till after breakfast? [Knock on door] Morning, Marta. DWP got mixed up again, sent your bill to our place. I mean, if they can't get our addresses right, do we really believe the charges? I mean, come on. [Chuckles] Thank you, Erika. Would you like some pancakes? Oh, thank you, but I couldn't. [Footsteps approaching] Hector : Well, I could. Have a great day, guys. Bye. Bye. Not eating, mija? I'm busting out of these jeans already. Not a really good look if I want a prom date. Carolina, look at me. Let me tell you something. You are beautiful. And kind. And funny. [Chuckles] So what if you don't look like these bimbos on TV? Not everyone sees things the way that you do, Dad. Boys, the right kind of boys, they'll notice how special you are. It happened for your mother and me. It'll happen for you, too. [Sighs] We'll see. [Chuckles] [Soft music plays] Blair : Adding a little art to the wall, are we? Hmm. This one looks better than the one by Hard-On's bunk. Nice move, by the way, making people think it's been up there since we were campers. That's not desperate at all. [Sighs] What you call desperate, I call creating a myth. [Sighs] Don't give me that mixtape crap. I know what I'm doing. Fine, but you don't even know Alex. I mean, you haven't seen him since '84, so why do you want him? He's just a trophy to you. What's wrong with a trophy? [Heavy breathing] [Scoffs] ♪ ♪ Jessie : Big night tomorrow. Where should we go? Alex : Not like we have many choices. We have the Plaza and... the Plaza! [Laughs] The Plaza? Townee bar. Not your scene. And why is that? Something tells me you're not a beer-and-wings type of girl. Drew : Oh, yeah, beer and wings. Great scene. Oh, 'cause you're way too cool for that, right? I think we all could use the break. It's only been a week, and I've already had two bed wetters. [Laughter] Cabin 10 hasn't exactly been a picnic to manage solo. Maybe if you hadn't dosed Blotter, you wouldn't have that problem. Look, I didn't dose anyone, and it was his drug dealer that led Anton out into the woods. Allegedly. You think it could've been someone else? Or nobody. For all we know, he could've imagined him. Ah, here he comes. [Sighs] Spielberg with the schedule. Spielberg. Well, I love some "Raiders of the Lost Ark" action, but I'm more of an indie guy... Jarmusch, Lee, Scorsese... Joel, schedule? Who's got the night off and who's stuck here... Working the most awesome movie night we've ever had? Seriously, Joel, who's helping you with said movie night? Blair, Jessie, and... Drew. [Laughs] Can't wait. Bring that enthusiasm. Blair : So, movie night will be fun. Cricket : So, Alex, you should stop by the art studio later, if you're free. Yeah, we'll see how my day goes. ♪ ♪ [Door opens] Cricket? Cricket. You've got to be kidding me. [Scoffs] Don't be so dramatic. Last time I checked, you were a virgin. [Sighs] It's just a little experiment. [School bell rings] Cricket, you don't want s*x. You want... a mixtape, someone that's into you because they know you. Nope, just the s*x, thanks. You're better than this. Wow. That's creative. Cool. Oh, that's awesome. Good work. [Chuckles] Very funny. I didn't write that. [Eerie music plays] Robotic voice :  Aardvark. Aardvark. Armadillo. Armadillo. Mm. It's camp. Try enjoying nature. Hmm. Looks like I've got a date to plan for. Yeah, but how would Alex know that... He's smart, and if it wasn't you, who else would it be? French fry for your thoughts? [Sighs] I'm still thinking about that kid up by camp, you know, what he said, that someone was going to die. This deer, Dave, now this kid... Something's happening by that lake. And one of the counselors told me they found an old cabin out there, some real creepy stuff. I was gonna go check it out later if you could spare me from speeding-ticket duty for awhile. Does it matter what I say? I thought I'd give you the courtesy of asking first. Yeah, thanks for that. So you really believe this is all tied together, Garrett? I don't know. But I do believe that something is going on at that camp. ♪ ♪ Hello? [Distant growling] [Suspenseful music plays] [Gasps] [Breathing heavily] [Twig snaps] [Screaming] Ugh! [Screams] [Gasps, breathing heavily] Ouch! Ah! Not a tetherball girl? Uh, I was better at the horseshoes. Hey, Cricket, do you want to come and take my place? Cricket? Are you okay? [Soft music plays] Yeah. I'm fine. Well, I had a bad dream last night. What happened? There were these people wearing masks, and there was a bonfire. [Suspenseful music plays] [Screaming] I think they were doing some kind of ritual. My boots were sinking into the ground like it was quicksand. I know it sounds ridiculous but... No. A-After all that happened with Dave and then Anton, I think we're all a little jumpy. Well, I've had nightmares before. This was different. When I woke up, I couldn't find my boots. Jessie : Your boots? During week one of camp? Maybe you didn't even bring them. Look... my first night here, I thought I was seeing things, too. But the truth was it was in my head because I was upset about something else. And once I realized that, I stopped seeing them. You will, too. Don't worry. Hi, Garrett. Garrett? I mean Deputy. I mean [chuckles] hi. Garrett's fine. Uh, so, what brings you out here? Tying up some loose ends. Saw some campers unrolling the big screen on the lawn. Yeah, it's movie night. Remember those well. Hope it's something good. I actually have the night off, headed into town... some place called the Plaza. You know it? Know it? My mother's worked there for years. Will you be out tonight, too? I'm on popcorn duty. That's too bad. [Soft music plays] [Rustling] [Ominous music plays] Hey! [Laughter] [Gasps] Little jumpy, are we? Did you see that? Those little pervs were spying on me. I could see why. You're hot. Yeah, to the prepubescent set. Blotter thought so. Hey, one, I was never into him, and, two, he's gone. His bunkmate, on the other hand... You really think Alex is going to be waiting by the lake? It's almost noon. Time to find out. [Bomb the Bass' "Beat Dis" plays] [All chanting "Chug, chug, chug, chug, chug, chug"] [Cheering] [Sighs] Worst party ever. But at least there's refreshments. Do you want one? Six months till summer. I'm wearing a bikini at camp this year. Ah. So, you're going to be a thin slut. Excellent. [Chuckles] I'm going to be noticed. Not one guy has come up and talked to me tonight. Who cares? In six months, we're never going to see any of these losers again, so I say we get out of here and go see a movie. "Scrooged" again? Yeah. Sure. Whatever. All right. Let's go. ♪ ♪ Cricket, right? Yeah. I'm Travis. Nice to meet you, Travis. We were actually leaving. Come on, Cricket. This is my house. I could give you the tour. It's a garage. There's an inside. Would you like to see it? Lead the way. [Bird cawing] ♪ ♪ [Notes play off-key] [Rustling] Heading in for a dip? You're that drug dealer, right? Well, my friends usually call me Damon. We're not friends. Ooh. That's not very nice, is it? Well, you don't seem like a very nice boy. You're not exactly giving me a chance, are you? Get out of here, Damon. Last I checked, this lake was open to the public. All right. All right. We're going. And you think I'm the one who isn't very nice. You okay? He try to hurt you? I'm fine. [INXS' "Never Tear Us Apart" plays] ♪ Don't ask me ♪ 
♪ What you know is true ♪ 
♪ Don't have to tell you ♪ 
♪ I love your precious heart ♪ 
♪ I, I was standing ♪ [Laughs] ♪ Two worlds collided ♪ [Bell rings] ♪ And they could never tear us apart ♪ [Sobbing] You were right. It wasn't Alex. So what? You're just gonna stay in and mope? It's your night off. Go put on a dress, show off that hot bod, and if Alex doesn't notice you, someone else will. Can't I just go to movie night with you? Um, I have my own agenda, and comforting you is not on it. So, get your skinny ass dressed. This night is not over yet. Damn right. It's just getting started. [Scoffs] Can we help you? You can't. But you can. Maybe something family friendly that the kids will love, like "E.T." or "Dumbo". No. Let's go edgier. Edgier at camp? [Laughs] Well, I'm not talking David Lynch "Blue Velvet" edgy, but maybe gateway edgy. Okay. "Five Easy Pieces," "Harold and Maude." I'm not really sure that our kids are ready for a film about an older woman and a younger man. Come on. It's about so much more than that. No, I get that. I love Hal Ashby. Have you seen "Shampoo"? Of course. [Laughs] You really were born about 20 years too late, weren't you? The best things in life are timeless. Mm. 
 
 Hey. Yeah? You know, most people, they don't understand me. But I feel like I could talk to you all night. Deb? Yes, sweetheart? It's Jessie. Her grandma died. Oh. [Creaking] [Sighs] Yank it somewhere else, dweebs! [Rustling] ♪ ♪ [Screams] Robotic voice :  Don't. Don't. Don't. Don't. Don't. Don't. Don't. Don't. Don't. Go. Don't go. Don't go. Hey. Deb : Jessie. I'm so sorry about your grandmother. Thank you. Please let me know if there's anything I can do. [Sighs] Amy, I have a humongous favor to ask. Yes, sure. Could you please take Jessie's shift tonight? I think she could really use a night off work. Of course. Thank you. Okay, everyone, have fun. Be safe. Okay. Let's go, guys. The Plaza calls. Come on, Cricket. There's a screwdriver waiting with your name on it. Well played. I can't believe you made me lie about your grandma. She did die... eight years ago. [Chuckles] Garrett : Yeah, hi. This is Deputy Sykes. I need to get into the archives. Does the library have any pieces on this town's history? I'm looking for stuff from the 1860s, 1870s, maybe. Anything unusual that happened at the lake around that time. Great. I can be down first thing in the morning. Thank you. ♪ And oh ♪ Buy me a drink, townee? ♪ I can't do without you for too long ♪ 
♪ You're my situation ♪ So, where is it? The screwdriver with my name on it. [Scoffs] How'd you know I like those? Well, you drank O.J. as if it was water when we were campers. Hey, remember when you puked orange in the middle of color wars? ♪ My kinda lover ♪ [Chuckles] Yo! Uh, excuse me. I got to, you know... ♪ You keep me all together ♪

Sorry, I don't hang with people who use the term "brewski." ♪ I can't see no reason ♪ Just one sec. ♪ My kinda lover ♪ What are you doing? He's a townee. I didn't come here to meet townees. Hey, don't knock townees, okay? They're not all bad. Okay, "A," he's not exactly hideous. ♪ My kinda lover ♪ He wants you. You want Alex. Use him to make Alex jealous. So evil. [Chuckles] I love it. Thank you. ♪ Rock me, sock me ♪

Nobody takes care of film anymore. Look at these marks. "Time Bandits" is an American classic. It deserves respect. I loved that film. Robin Hood, Napoleon... all that time travel was really cool. Oh, damn it. Would you hand me that splicer? Yeah. You know, some people say all that stuff was in that kid's head. I don't believe that. Isn't reality all in our heads, too? Yeah. That's a good point. We're all set. Awesome. I can't wait to watch it again. Aren't you upset? About what? That you're stuck here tonight, away from Sykes. He'll be fine. I'm sure Jessie's all over him right now, anyway. Her grandma just died. Her grandma didn't die. She just didn't want me around, getting between her and Garrett. Why didn't you say anything? Because camp is about more than finding a guy for me. It's about having friends, making friends, and the last way to do that is by making an enemy out of someone like Jessie. You are super Zen. [Chuckles] [Heavy metal music plays] [Sighs] Thanks for walking me home. I just couldn't deal with school today. Six more months, Cricket. Six more months. [Clattering] ♪ ♪ [Indistinct whispering] Carolina. I can explain. Don't... Don't tell your mother. She'd die. Carolina! [Engine revs, tires screech] Kind of fast, no? [Tires screech] Geez, slow down! [Engine revs] [Dramatic music plays] You. It was you. [Laughs] Let me out. Aah! [Tires squeal] Oh! [Siren wailing] Aah! What the hell are you doing here? Her friends were worried about her getting in the car with you. I can't imagine why. He's been stalking me! Stalking? Come on. She was begging for it. What did you just say? Every camp has a whore. All right. Okay. Come on. Come on. Enough. Let's go. Come on. That's enough. [Coughing] ♪ ♪ Blair : So, I thought, "Movie night. Sure. Why not? I like movies and I like nights and..." Do you, I-I mean, like either of those things? Well, I love movies, but I haven't seen this one. Have you seen "Time Bandits?" Because Joel's been going on and on about it, and I...

I stopped by The Sharper Image at the mall the other day, and I found something. It's perfect for your father. Have you seen those little rotating tie racks? They... Cricket? Sweetie, what is it? Mom... there's something I have to tell you. It's okay. Talk to me. Dad, he's... [Sighs] I saw him with Erika. I'm sorry you saw that, honey. Wait, what? You knew? I know. Honey, I know. Well, why don't you do something? Like what? Get a divorce? Start dating again at my age? But, Mom, you deserve better. You don't know what goes into a marriage, Carolina. So, what? You just look the other way? Don't you have any self-respect? One of these days, you'll realize, women like us, sometimes we have to settle. ♪ ♪ [Gasps] I got to go. What? I got to leave. I'm sorry. Hey, hey, wait, wait. Wait. Hey, what did I do? Cricket! [Sighs] I feel terrible. I never should have let Cricket get in the car with him. You didn't know. I thought we were walking to your cabin. We are. In a minute. [Laughter in distance] Ah, movie night. Are they still putting too much salt on the popcorn? [Chuckles] Stillwater tradition. Some things never change. No, they don't. Here it is. I found it the other day. I completely forgotten about it. Do you remember when we carved that? Yeah, I do. Do you remember what happened after we carved it? You know, that wasn't just our first kiss. That was  my  first kiss. Ever. Mine too. ♪ ♪ I should head back. Well? Best... night... ever. [Chuckles] [Chuckles] And you? [Chuckles] You got a mixtape, literally. I was so wrong about Alex. No. You were right about Blotter. And you were right about me. Turns out I do want a mixtape. And now he's gone. Well, there's always next summer. [Chuckles] Come on. Let's go. [Both laughing] ♪ ♪ [Door closes] Hey, Jessie. What's that? Cookies for you. You know, I know exactly how you feel. My grandma died when I was 8. It was the worst. We made them for movie night. They're still fresh. I knew you were out, so I saved you some. When my grandma passed, after the funeral, my best friend brought me cookies and tried to make me feel better. And the crazy thing is, they kind of helped. So I hope they help you, even just a tiny bit. Thank you. Okay. [Chuckles] Heelan : I don't like it any more than you do, but it's he said/she said. Having a red marker in your glove box ain't a crime. Neither's owning a knife. We had to let Crowley go. Read this. What is it? Read it. It's from a soldier from 1871. It's his journal. Checked that out of the library. They've got collections going back farther than you'd think. Uh... "The spiritualist cult led by the imperious leader known only as Holyoke met a horrific end at our hands last night. Holyoke's followers believed Lake Stillwater held supernatural power and were trying to summon said power through an occult ritual before their deaths brought an end to their unholy pursuits." Unholy pursuits? Apparently, when they found him, he was playing the piano. The villagers dragged him out, killed him, burned down his cabin till there was nothing but ashes left. Uh, newfound interest in local history, Deputy? What if I told you I was standing in that cabin yesterday? Well, I'd say that there are lots of old, deserted, uh, hunting cabins in these woods. Look... I can see you believe this, Garrett, and I want to believe you, but, I mean, you're basing this on... on some journal from over a century ago? A story like that would've been in the papers. People would've known. What if someone didn't want people to know? Hey. Hey. Projector's all packed up. Thanks. You're welcome. What's with the box? It's a reminder. Of... It's a reminder that no matter what, you should never stop chasing your dreams. My life took a wrong turn. I didn't become the person that I wanted to be. This, uh, reminds me of when things were different. ♪ ♪ What's that? It's an old piece of junk. Thank you for packing up the projector. You're welcome. Mm-hmm. I'll see you later. Yes. ♪ ♪ What does a cult from 1871 have anything to do with that lake? You didn't finish reading. Uh... "Amid many disturbing sights we found along the lake, one in particular has haunted me..." "...a deer carcass." "Its heart was torn out in a ritual that could only be called evil." That's the thing about history, Sheriff.
