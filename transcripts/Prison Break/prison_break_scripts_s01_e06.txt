 AGENT KELLERMAN: We need a favour 
 MAN: I've been out of the life for years 
 AGENT KELLERMAN: I know. Problem is, no ones gonna believe that if I take the heroin I have in my pocket and put it in the glove box of the reasonably priced minivan you got over there. I will cuff you. I will drag you out of here in front of everyone.

 VERONICA: What did you tell him?

 [VERONICAS APARTMENT] 
 (VERONICA walks out of her apartment, locking the door behind her) 
 (VERONICA turns around and finds NICK there, he startles her) 
 NICK: Do you want to tell me why you haven't returned any of my calls? 
 VERONICA: Look I really appreciate everything you've done, but I don't want your help any more. 
 NICK: Don't want my help anymore. Do you really think I had something to do with that missing tape? 
 VERONICA: No, look I'm just gonna go grab a cup of coffee and get back to work. Okay. I don't have time for this right now.

 (MICHAEL puts the blankets over him again) 
 (The Guard continues walking) 
 MICHAEL: I can't get through the wall 
 SUCRE: What do you mean you can't get through the wall? 
 MICHAEL: I know how to do it, I just don't have the time to do it 
 SUCRE: We're locked up, all we got is time 
 MICHAEL: You don't understand. I planned this break on a schedule. Constantly coming up here for count won't let me do what I need to do to get through that wall. If I'm not back on schedule, which means that we're through that wall by the end of the day manna, we're not getting out of here. 
 (SUCRE leans over the edge of his bed to look at MICHAEL) 
 SUCRE: There's three things for certain in life - death, taxes and count. The only way to stop count is... 
 MICHAEL: What? 
 SUCRE: (REGRETTING HAVING SAID THAT) Never mind. It's a bad idea 
 MICHAEL: Worse than the idea of losing Maricruz? 
 SUCRE: (GIVING IN) A lock down. We get Gen Pop locked down for a day you'll have all the time you need 
 MICHAEL: And no count? 
 SUCRE: Bulls don't even come by. Only one problem 
 MICHAEL: How do we get a lock down? 
 (SUCRE wipes sweat off his forehead with his hand, he gets and idea) 
 SUCRE: Can you get to the prison AC unit? 
 MICHAEL: Maybe 
 SUCRE: (SITTING UP) You want to get a lockdown? You'd better get the inamtes riled up. And if you wanna piss of the meat in concrete, turn up the heat.

 MICHAEL: Global warming 
 SARAH: Probably, you got a minute? 
 MICHAEL: About 5 years worth 
 SARAH: Sorry. Right. Umm. You never told me LINCOLN BURROWS was your brother 
 MICHAEL: Never came up 
 SARAH: Right. I'm curious if that isn't because of my father, the governor. He may not be the one pulling the switch but he has the power to grant clemency and he won't. And he never does 
 MICHAEL: My old man was an abusive drunk who abandoned his family. I don't judge anyone by their father's actions, or inactions, if that was your concern 
 SARAH: Just so you know, I don't agree with his politics and I'm sorry about your brother 
 MICHAEL: I appreciate that 
 (SARAH walks away) 
 (SARAH turns around) 
 SARAH: Hey, this isn't much, umm, I have to give LINCOLN a weekly check-up. If you want I could schedule those visits to end right before you come in for your shots. That way you could at least see each other, even if it is just in passing 
 MICHAEL: Thank you 
 (SARAH walks away) 
 (MICHAEL turns around and walks the opposite way, towards a group of people sitting on the bleachers)

 LINCOLN: He found somebody that can help us out 
 VERONICA: (To NICK) You have one minute 
 NICK: I've been going over the incident report. Somebody made an anonymous call to the local cops claiming to see LINCOLN running away from the garage with bloody pants 
 VERONICA: We've been through this okay. You can' cross examine a witness if you don' know who it is 
 NICK: We don' need to know who he is. We know where he is 
 VERONICA: What do you mean? 
 NICK: It took some doing but a PI friend of mine was able to backtrack the phone call to the police department. Whoever made that call couldn't have seen LINCOLN running from the garage that night

 (BELLICK walks through the door of the sick bay and finds SARAH) 
 BELLICK: This is not a good time doc 
 SARAH: I just got a call. A prisoner has heat exhaustion 
 BELLICK: He's faking it 
 SARAH: Is that your medical opinion? 
 BELLICK:(Takes his hat off) We got a bunch of overheated cons getting loud in A-wing 
 SARAH: I don' blame 'em. It's like an oven in here 
 BELLICK: Everything's under control, you should go back to the infirmary and when things calm down I'll have your patients transferred from sick bay. Just looking out for your best interests

 (INMATES start laughing) 
 BELLICK: Get your hands off the fence! 
 INMATE: Suck it pig! 
 BELLICK: You know Teddy. You really let me down. And that's hard to do because I don't expect much from the inbred child of a retard. 
 (This gets to T-BAG) 
 BELLICK: That's right Teddy, I read your psych records bout how your dad raped his Mongoloid sister and then 9 months later little Teddy pops out 
 (T-BAG gets out of control) 
 T-BAG: I'm gonna kill you 
 (INMATES climb the bars) 
 BELLICK: Hot as hell. They'll wear themselves out eventually 
 CUT TO: 
 (LINCOLN looks out window) 
 LINCOLN: The call was a fake. What about a stay of execution? 
 NICK: It's legally insufficient 
 LINCOLN: What the hell does that mean? 
 (LINCOLN kicks a chair) 
 LINCOLN: What the hell does that mean? 
 VERONICA: It means the prosecution could point out the evidence from your criminal trial okay, the blood, the video, the gun. A questionable phone call is not going to stack up to that. 
 LINCOLN: It's something right? 
 NICK: Absolutely. We got an area code. My contact will track it down to someplace more specific, a building, a neighborhood, a block to the person who made this call 
 LINCOLN: Okay, what happens next? 
 NICK: We need to catch the next flight to Washington DC. That is if you trust me now

 (CHARLES' cat runs away) 
 (T-BAG finds MACKS keys, he holds them up to the camera) 
 BELLICK: whose keys are those? 
 MACK: I guess in all the commotion 
 (BELLICK tries to walk out. GEARY stops him)

 LINCOLN: Go to DC its all we got. I'll take care of MICHAEL alright 
 VERONICA: Okay

 SUCRE: I got a question for you fish. What if you do all this work and the pipe turns out to be 10 feet that way? 
 MICHAEL: It won't 
 SUCRE: What you got x-ray vision? 
 MICHAEL: I calculated the drill point co-ordinates, hid them in my tattoo and projected them onto the wall. Everything's been worked out so the image hits the right point of the wall. Its just math 
 SUCRE: What if your math's wrong 
 MICHAEL: You'll drill into one of the dozen gas lines behind the wall. There'll be an explosion and we'll be burnt alive.
