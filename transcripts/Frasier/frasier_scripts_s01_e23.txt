 Skyline: The Seattle sky line is drawn with no extras. 
 Act One.  
 Scene One – KACL 
Frasier and Roz in their respective booths, the show is going on. 
 Frasier: Gee, I'm sorry, Blake.  When I told you to close your eyes 
         and visualize that you were on a tropical island, I didn't 
         realize you were calling from your car phone.  
 The camera pans to Roz, who looks mildly horrified. 
   Blake: [v.o.] That's OK, Doc.  At least I know my airbags work. 
Frasier: [laughs uncomfortably] Well, I'm glad you're alright. 
         And thank you for your call. 
 Gil Chesterton edges open the door and slides into the booth. 
He waves and mouths "Hi."  
 Frasier: Well, look who's popped into the booth!  It's Gil Chesterton, 
         KACL's own food critic - which means, it's my cue to hit 
         the road.  So, till tomorrow, this is Dr. Frasier Crane, 
         wishing you... [starts to sneeze] a good day... [sneezes] 
         and-and good health. 
 He goes off the air.  Gil comes in with his hands behind his back. 
Roz enters the booth. 
     Gil: [motherly] Hey, Frasier! 
Frasier: Hello, Gil. 
    Gil: I heard you coughing on the air earlier today.  Sounds like 
         you might be coming down with something.  So I had this sent 
         over from Rosenthal's Deli. [hands Frasier a white paper bag] 
         Chicken soup, so lovingly prepared even the chicken gets well. 
Frasier: Thank you.  That's very kind. 
    Gil: And of course I'd never forget you, Roz. [hands her a smaller 
         bag] Some ladyfingers, that have been soaked in rum. 
    Roz: Mmm! 
Frasier: Much like her own.  
 He coughs repeatedly and loudly, ignoring Roz's offended look. 
     Gil: I say, I hope this isn't the start of that nasty flu that's 
         going around.  You want to take a couple of days off, nip it 
         in the bud, I'd be happy to cover your time slot for you. 
Frasier: No, no, thank you.  I'll be fine tomorrow. 
    Gil: Okey-dokey.  But, uh... feel free to call me if you change 
         your mind. 
 He leaves, as Roz bites into a ladyfinger. 
     Roz: Mmm!  Plump, gooey, and guaranteed to rot your teeth. 
Frasier: Yes.  I don't like his phony British accent much, either. 
    Roz: You sure got a bug up your mind about Gil.  What's your 
         problem? 
Frasier: I just don't trust him.  Nobody's that nice unless they want 
         something from you. 
 Roz picks up something from the table and heads back to her booth. 
     Roz: He's just a generous person. 
Frasier: Oh, yes! [getting up and following her] He was very generous 
         to Bonnie Weems!  Bought her a case of wine, asked her to let 
         him have her timeslot when she was off on vacation.  When she 
         got back, she had been banished to the midnight to four a.m. 
         slot! 
    Roz: What are you saying?  He's trying to take our timeslot? 
Frasier: I'm just saying we should watch our backs.  How would you 
         like to work from midnight to four a.m.?  What would happen 
         to your social life?  Those are your peak hours! [smirks] 
    Roz: You're just being paranoid. 
Frasier: No, I'm not. [returns to his booth] 
    Roz: [following him] Yes, you are!  The man brought you some 
         chicken soup.  It does not mean he wants your timeslot. 
         Besides, why would he be bribing us?  He'd be bribing the 
         higher-ups, they're the ones who make the decisions! 
 At that moment, Gil enters with another paper bag. 
     Gil: Frasier! [sees the first bag] Oh good, it's still here. 
         I’m so sorry.  This is your soup. [hands him the bag in 
         his hand and takes the one off the console] This is the 
         Lobster Newburg I bought for the station manager's cat. 
 He leaves.  Frasier, vindicated, throws a knowing look at Roz. 
 Frasier: I'll see you tomorrow, Roz. 
 He grabs his briefcase off the console and leaves. 
 FADE OUT 
 SPRING IS IN THE AIR 
 Scene Two - Frasier's apartment 
Martin and Daphne are seated at the table, both reading from the 
newspaper. 
  Daphne: Oh, here's a gruesome bit.  A partly-decomposed body just 
         washed up in Puget Sound! 
 Martin: Hey, that's good news! 
 Daphne: [shocked] I beg your pardon? 
 Martin: Bodies don't rise till the weather gets warmer.  You get your 
         first floater, and spring's just around the corner!  
 Daphne looks suitably disgusted. 
 Frasier enters from his bedroom, clumsily dressed and looking 
extremely tired.  
 Frasier: [listlessly] Morning, Dad, Daphne. 
 Martin: Frasier, you sound awful! 
Frasier: [unconvincingly] It's just a little bug. 
 Daphne: But you can't be thinking of going to work!  You're all pasty 
         and clammy and pale! 
 Martin: And coming from an English person, that's bad! 
 Daphne, offended, picks up the breakfast dishes and marches into 
the kitchen. 
 Frasier: Don’t worry, Dad.  As you've often said, "if you can walk, 
         you can work."  Took kind of an ironic twist the day you 
         got shot in the hip! 
 Martin: Well, at least I had a real job.  Half your listening 
         audience hears voices already, and the other half talks to 
         themselves!  If you don't show up, who's going to notice? 
Frasier: Well, I'm out of here.  
 He puts down his mug and walks over to the coat rack.  Daphne runs 
after him from the kitchen. 
  Daphne: But you're burning up!  You really should stay home and 
         let me tend to you.  I'm a very good nurse.  I mended all 
         my brothers' soccer injuries. 
Frasier: [shrugging into his coat] Well, I didn't get injured playing 
         soccer. 
 Daphne: Neither did my hooligan brothers.  Mostly they got hurt 
         beating up drunken Dutchmen in the stands.  
 Frasier sneezes explosively. 
  Martin: [folding his arms] Well, that's going to look pretty against 
         the glass in your booth!  Why don't you just stay home? 
Frasier: Dad, Daphne, thank you, thank you.  But I'm a physician. 
         I believe that I am the best monitor of my own condition. 
         I'm fine!  Fit as a fiddle! 
 He pulls open the door and exits.  
 Beat.  
 The doorbell sounds, languidly and tiredly.  Daphne, who has turned 
away, returns expectantly to the door and opens it to reveal a very 
sick Frasier. 
 Frasier: [whining] I'm sick...! 
 Daphne supports Frasier as he trudges back into the living room. 
 FADE TO: 
 Scene Three – KACL 
Gil is on the air, doing his show in Frasier’s timeslot.  
     Gil: And we’re back, with “Restaurant Beat.”  This is Gil 
         Chesterton and I'm filling in for Dr. Frasier Crane. 
         We're here talking to Louis, who has forgotten that 
         tonight is his tenth anniversary.  Well, Louis, I 
         believe I've saved your proverbial derriere!  During 
         the commercial, I managed to secure you a private booth 
         at Maximillian's.  Just promise me for dessert you'll 
         have their Schwarzwälder Kirschtorte. 
  Louis: The... the what? 
    Gil: The Schwarzwälder... [condescendingly] well, maybe 
         you'd better stick with the rainbow sherbet. 
  Louis: I don't know how to thank you.  You saved my marriage! 
    Gil: No, don't thank me!  I'm only here tonight because our dear 
         Dr. Crane is home with the flu. 
 The scene changes to Frasier’s room.  Frasier is lying in bed with 
a thermometer in his mouth.  He is listening to Gil on a radio above 
his bed.  Martin reads the newspaper in a chair by the bed. 
     Gil: [on radio] If you're listening, Doc, all of us here 
         at KACL want you to get better soon. 
Frasier: [mumbling around the thermometer] I just bet you do. 
 Daphne comes out of the bathroom. 
  Daphne: Time to check if the turkey's done. [she takes out the 
         thermometer] 
Frasier: Dad, you know, you don't have to sit in here with me all 
         day. 
 Martin: Oh no, no problem.  You need company when you're sick.  You 
         never know when you're going to croak. 
 Daphne: Oh, boy.  Your temperature is up there - one hundred and one! 
         You are a sick boy. 
Frasier: Thank you for reminding me, Daphne. 
 Martin: Naw, I remember the sickest I ever was.  They'd shipped us 
         back from Korea.  I got this Oriental parasite, that was 
         building its own little pagoda right in my colon... 
Frasier: Thank you, Dad. 
 Daphne: You know, you might try some of my homeopathic tea.  It'll 
         flush out your system, and it'll also make your hair more 
         shiny and manageable.  
 She fluffs her own hair, while sterilizing the thermometer with alcohol. 
 Frasier: No, no thank you. 
 Martin: Oh, no!  That wasn't the sickest I was.  It was that time 
         Your mother and I took that trip down to Mexico.  I was real 
         careful about the water, and then I ate this piece of lettuce. 
         Next thing you know, I'm spewing both for accuracy and 
         distance.  I spent the night curled up on the stone floor, 
         screaming, "I want to die, I want to die!" 
Frasier: Wouldn’t that have been a tragedy?  You wouldn't be here with 
         me now! 
 Martin: OK, I get the point.  I'll give you a little peace and quiet 
         here. [gets up and starts to leave] Oh, no!  What was I 
         thinking of?  What about the time your mother left the potato 
         salad in the trunk of the car?  I'm still sick from that one! 
 Martin leaves.  Daphne carries a tray to the door. 
  Daphne: [pleasantly] Is there anything else you need? 
Frasier: A little more ginger ale, please. 
 Daphne: Very well, then.  
 She turns to leave but he calls her back. 
 Frasier: Oh Daphne, this time make it shaved ice, not cubes.  And I 
         don't like those straws.  Can I have the bendy kind?  And the 
         saltines, they're too salty.  I need the low-sodium. 
 Daphne: Your wish is my command. 
 She turns to leave again.  This time, she is stopped by Niles, 
who is just entering the room.  
   Niles: Hello, Daphne.  Is he in pain? 
 Daphne: Not enough.  
 She exits.  Niles bends over Frasier, covering his mouth with his 
handkerchief. 
   Niles: Frasier, I brought you something. 
Frasier: Niles!  Put the hanky down, for God's sake!  It's not the 
         plague! 
 Niles does, carefully folding the handkerchief and placing it on the 
bed before sitting down.  He’s carrying a plastic bag with a slime- 
green pouch inside, with a lanyard around it. 
   Niles: Well, look.  This is from Marta, our maid.  It's a poultice 
         you wear around your neck.  The recipe comes from her remote 
         mountain village in Guatemala. 
Frasier: [catches a whiff] I can see why her village is remote! 
  Niles: Well yes, it is pungent. [drapes it around Frasier’s neck] 
         But, by inhaling these herbs, many of the villagers live to be 
         well over a hundred.  Marta herself is seventy-eight, and you 
         should see her scramble up the stairs when Maris rings her 
         little bell. 
 The phone rings. 
 Frasier: Oh, Niles, would you mind? 
  Niles: Of course. 
 Obligingly, Niles gets off the bed and walks to the phone. 
Eddie scampers into the room and bounces up onto Frasier's 
bed next to him. 
 Frasier: Oh, hello Eddie!  For once I'm actually glad to see you! 
         Here.  
 He drapes the poultice around the dog's neck.  Horrified, Eddie 
runs out of the room.  Frasier laughs to himself. 
 Niles returns to the bed, phone in hand. 
   Niles: [returning to the bed, phone in hand] Uh, it's for you. 
         It's - Roz? 
Frasier: [taking the phone and speaking weakly] Hello. 
    Roz: So, how are you feeling? 
Frasier: Awful, thank you. 
 Reset to: we see Roz standing at the payphone outside the studio, 
as Gil still goes on with his show. 
     Roz: Well, I'm sorry to hear that.  Because I really think you 
         should get your butt back down here.  You were right about 
         Gil, Frasier.  He's lobbying for our slot.  I was talking to 
         Millie in Traffic and she overheard Gil talking to the station 
         manager.  It was all about how our timeslot is perfect for his 
         show because it's mid-afternoon and everyone is making [posh 
         accent] dinner plans! 
Frasier: I knew it, I knew it!  Geez... OK, Roz, you can count on me. 
         I'll be there tomorrow. 
    Roz: Well, you'd better be!  I don't trust that greedy, finger- 
         Licking runt as far as I can throw him. 
    Gil: [sticking his head out of the booth] I say, Roz, how am I 
         doing so far? 
    Roz: [fake] Fabulous! 
 Reset to: Frasier’s room. 
 Frasier: OK, I'll be in tomorrow. 
 He hangs up the receiver, and Niles replaces the phone on the desk. 
   Niles: Frasier, you can't be serious about going in tomorrow.  Your 
         pupils are dilated. [he touches his brother's forehead] You 
         have a fever.   
 He wets a cotton swab with the alcohol and meticulously cleans 
his hands. 
   Niles: You go in in that condition, you won't even make it to the... 
Frasier: Oh, I just don't trust Gil Chesterton.  I think he's after my 
         timeslot. [exasperated] Oh Niles, will you stop it with the 
         alcohol! 
 Niles reluctantly places the cotton wool into the plastic bag that 
once held the poultice. 
 Frasier: I just can't let that smarmy little chowhound do my show for 
         another day!  Oh God, anybody would be better! [inspiration 
         strikes] Niles, Niles, would you do my show for me? 
  Niles: Frasier, I think that fever of yours is making you delusional. 
Frasier: Oh, no!  I filled in for you when you were too sick to meet 
         with your "Fear of Intimacy" group! 
  Niles: [heading into the bathroom] I wasn't sick.  They were just 
         getting too close. 
Frasier: Oh, I guess you're right.  It's probably a bad idea.  Doing my 
         show requires a set of abilities that you just don't possess. 
         You have to be able to size up your patients very quickly, and 
         then dispense your advice in an entertaining and insightful 
         manner. 
  Niles: [re-entering the room] Frasier, this pathetic attempt at 
         reverse psychology is beneath you. 
Frasier: [knowingly] Then you're not going to do my show? 
  Niles: [defiantly] No, I AM going to do your show, and I'm going to 
         do it better than you ever DREAMED of doing it! 
 Niles walks out, and Frasier is happy – until Eddie scampers in 
with the poultice in his teeth.  He drops it back onto Frasier's 
chest then scampers out again.  Frasier stares after him venomously. 
 FADE TO: 
 Scene Four – KACL 
Roz and Niles are in Frasier's booth.  She is showing him around 
the control panel. 
     Roz: [pointing] And here's the cough button in case you need to 
         cough or clear your throat. [holds up a blue cart] And most 
         important, here's an extra-long commercial to use if you need 
         a bathroom break. 
  Niles: Thank you, but those won't be necessary.  I have no cough 
         reflex, and excellent bladder control. 
    Roz: [sarcastically deadpan] It's true - all the good ones ARE 
         married. [leaving for her booth] You're on in ten seconds 
         and your first caller is Marcia. 
  Niles: Marcia...  
 He places the headphones around his neck and sits down, covering the 
mike with his hand.  Clearing his throat, he tries out catchphrases.  
   Niles: "Hello, Marcia, I'm listening."  That is so trite.  "Hello, 
         Marcia, tell me where it hurts." No, no... “Hello, Marcia, 
         I hear you."  No... 
 Roz points to him.  Not understanding, he points back to her, 
while continuing to mutter to himself.  Roz points at him again, 
more urgently.  He still doesn’t understand that he is on. 
     Roz: [speaking into her mike] Good afternoon, Seattle! 
  Niles: Oh, yes! [puts on his headphones] Hello!  This is Dr. Niles 
         Crane, filling in for my ailing brother, Dr. Frasier Crane. 
         Although I feel perfectly qualified to fill Frasier's radio 
         shoes, I should warn you that while Frasier is a Freudian, 
         I am a Jungian.  So there'll be no blaming Mother today.  
 He is proud of himself for having gotten thus far, and doesn't 
notice Roz sigh and sink back into her chair.  
   Niles: Ooh-kay, Roz, who's my first caller? 
    Roz: We have Marcia on line three.  She's in love with her 
         husband's brother. 
  Niles: This day promises not to disappoint. [jabs a button 
         professionally] Hello, Marcia.  “Let's get better!” 
 Pleased with himself, he gives Roz a “how’s that?” shrug. 
Surprised, she gives him a “hey, not bad” signal back. 
 Reset to: Frasier's bedroom.  He is listening to the radio as 
Daphne takes his temperature again, laughing at Niles’s performance. 
   Niles: [on radio] But before we get into the specifics of your 
         problem, why don't I give you a little historical background? 
         The psychiatrist Sigmar Bromnoh - that's B-R-O-M-N-O-H - in 
         the late 1950s, wrote extensively on the problem you are 
         facing.  Which is all the more amazing when you realise that 
         Bromnoh was a prominent Reichian, although... 
Frasier: [gleefully] Listen to him!  He's terrible!  
 He shuts off the radio.  Daphne removes the thermometer. 
  Daphne: And, I'm afraid, so are you.  Your temperature's up to one 
         hundred and three. 
Frasier: Oh, it could go up to a hundred and five, I couldn't be 
         better!  My timeslot is safe.  Niles is as dry as this 
         toast you brought me - with the crust still on.  I'm 
         sure when I’m ready to go back, they'll send a limo! 
 Daphne: Well, I'll just go get you another drink.  Was that last straw 
         bendy enough? 
Frasier: Perfect, thank you. [she starts to leave] Oh Daphne, Daphne, 
         look. [points at a tissue box on the bed next to him] Here, 
         take these tissues away.  I, they hurt my nose.  I want that 
         kind with the little moisturizer droplet between the sheets. 
         And the rose petals in the humidifier - I think they're 
         starting to wilt. 
 Daphne: Oh, of course.  Anything you like.  Fresh rose petals, 
         crust-less toast, soft tissues... [turning to leave, 
         muttering bitterly] acupuncture needles where you least 
         expect them... 
 End Of Act One (Time: 10:05) 
 Act Two.  
 Scene One - KACL 
Niles is pacing the booth, with his jacket off and his shirtsleeves 
rolled up.  He is holding the mike and speaking animatedly into it. 
   Niles: Howard, Lois, I could stay on the air counseling you all day, 
         but– [glances at the clock] we’re coming to the end of our 
         hour, so I'm just going to cut to the quick.  If one of you 
         doesn't say, "I love you" right now - right now - frankly, 
         I don't see how you could have any kind of future together. 
         So, which of you has the courage to say, "I love you?” 
 In her booth, Roz is impressed; Niles has gotten pretty good. 
    Lois: [v.o.] Howard... I love you. 
  Niles: [thrilled] Yes!  Yes!  Howard, she loves you!  What about you? 
 Howard: [v.o.] I, uh... 
  Niles: Howard?  Are you going to just pack up your emotional tent and 
         walk away... Howard?  Howard, it's up to you!  Can you say 
         it?!  Can you?! 
    Roz: [caught up in the excitement] Come on, Howard!  Come on, 
         Howard! 
 Howard: I... I love you too, Lois! 
    Roz: YES! 
 SMASH CUT TO: Frasier’s bedroom, where the three members of the 
Crane household are listening to Niles's triumphant broadcast. 
 Martin, in his chair by the bed, laughs.  Daphne happily jumps on 
Frasier’s back – which she can do because Frasier is face-down on 
the bed, writhing in envy. 
  Daphne: He said it, he said it! 
  Niles: [on radio] But I’m afraid we’re going to have to interrupt 
         this radio moment with a commercial... [Daphne turns off the 
         radio] 
 Martin: Hey, Niles is pretty good! 
Frasier: Good?   Good?!  The little rat is scintillating!  Oh, why 
         couldn't he just do what's expected of him for once and 
         stink?!  He's even better than Gil Chesterton!  Oh, God - 
         they're trying to make me look bad! 
 Martin: Aw, geez.  This high temperature of yours is making you 
         zooey. 
Frasier: No!  No!  It's made me clear-headed.  I’ve gotta get down 
         there, go to that station, reclaim what's rightfully mine!   
 He struggles out of bed, and to his feet. 
 Frasier: There'll be no more filling in by anybody!  No way, no how! 
         No way, no... 
 Martin: [stands] Frasier, you're not going anywhere. 
Frasier: [facing off with his dad] Oh, who's going to stop me? 
 Martin: I am. 
Frasier: Oh, how are you - a man with a limp and a cane - going to stop 
         a man in the prime of his life? 
 Martin pokes Frasier in the chest, and the latter falls pathetically 
back onto the bed, groaning loudly. 
  Martin: [over Frasier's whining] And I wasn't even leaning on my cane. 
         Come on, Daphne. 
 He beckons to Daphne, and they both start walking out of the room. 
  Daphne: Boy, he really is sick. 
 Martin: Huh!  You want to talk sick?  1962, World's Fair.  The Tilt-A- 
         Whirl was right next to the “Little Taste Of India”... 
 FADE TO: 
 I GO TO PIECES 
 Scene Two – KACL 
Frasier is back doing his show, with Roz in her booth. 
 Frasier: As you know, I was out sick most of the week, and I'd like 
         to take this opportunity to express my sincere gratitude to 
         Gil Chesterton and to my brother Niles for doing such a 
         great job of filling in for me. 
 Oddly enough, Niles and Gil are both standing ominously at a half- 
screened window behind Frasier. 
 Frasier: I really appreciate it, guys. 
 Turning to the window, he waves cheerily.  Both Niles and Gil lift 
their hands to return the wave at exactly the same time, looking 
decidedly sinister. 
 Frasier: Well Roz, now that I'm back to normal and feeling great, 
         who's our first caller? 
    Roz: We have Sonya from Auburn on line three. 
Frasier: Let's just hear what Sonya has to say...  
 He presses a button on his console.  BANG!  A bomb under his chair 
explodes, vaporizing him.  Roz looks upwards, bewildered, as debris 
rains down on Frasier’s console. 
 SMASH CUT TO: Frasier’s Bedroom 
Frasier (still sick), wakes up screaming.  
 Frasier: DAPHNE!  DAPHNE! 
 
 
 
 Daphne storms in, having almost reached her limit. 
  Daphne: What is it this time?! 
Frasier: I had a dream!  I had a dream!  They are plotting against me! 
 Daphne: Oh, now now, Dr. Crane.  I thought we went over this already. 
         It's just your fever talking! 
Frasier: [suspiciously] Oh, that's just what you want me to think! 
         You're probably in league with Niles!  I know about the two 
         of you!  Oh, you pretend not to know, but you know!  
 [N.B. Frasier almost blew Niles’s secret right here!!!  In fact, 
Jane Leeves, who says she knows more about Daphne than the writers 
who created her, always maintained that Daphne has always been 
aware of Niles’s feelings for her, but sublimates them out of 
feelings of inferiority. – Mike Lee] 
 Frasier grabs his prescription pad off the desk and starts scribbling 
on it. 
 Frasier: I’ve gotta get back down there and take my show back! 
 Daphne: But you can barely function! 
Frasier: Yes, well, these prescriptions will take care of that 
         and more. [rips off a slip and passes it to her] Now 
         here, run down to the drugstore, post-haste! 
 Daphne: [reading it] Syducane?!  This'll have you high as a kite! 
Frasier: That's only until I take a couple of these!  
 He rips off another slip and gives it to her.  As he climbs out of 
bed, she reads it and her eyes widen. 
 [N.B. A play on the name of series writer Sy Dukane.] 
  Daphne: Oh now, Dr. Crane, I really don't think you're in any shape... 
Frasier: Thank you!  But the moment I give a fig for what you think 
         is the day that England produces a great chef, a world-class 
         bottle of wine, and a car that has a decent electrical 
         system! 
 And for Daphne, that’s the limit. 
  Daphne: [furious] You know, being a health-care provider, I try to 
         be sympathetic towards my patients.  But I have reached the 
         end of my tether with you, Doctor!  You are by far the most 
         ungrateful, disagreeable, self-centered, whiny fusspot I've 
         ever had the misfortune of dealing with!  I've had patients 
         on their deathbeds who were more considerate, and a damn 
         sight more jolly too!  As far as I'm concerned, you can lay 
         in those sweaty sheets until you're one giant bedsore! 
Frasier: Are you done? 
 Daphne: [calming down somewhat] Yes. 
Frasier: Then scurry on down to the drugstore and get those filled 
         while I get dressed! 
 He turns toward his closet, as Daphne stalks out of the bedroom.

 RADIO DAZE 
 Scene Three - KACL 
Outside the studio, Gil is talking to another employee.  Frasier 
walks in, unkempt and with a goofy smile on his face.  
     Gil: Oh, Frasier!  What a surprise to see you here today! 
Frasier: Well, it's no wonder.  I've taken some wonder drugs, I feel 
         wonderful! [laughs] So I'm going to go do my show now - so 
         ta-ta, Pieman! 
 He pulls open the door and enters, as Gil looks confused and a 
little alarmed.  Inside the booth, Niles is talking.  Roz notices 
Frasier first. 
   Niles: Thank you, Greta.  It's always satisfying to know I've 
         changed someone's life. [sees Roz signaling and looks] 
         Oh, look who's just wandered into my booth, it's my 
         brother Frasier. 
Frasier: Hello, Niles.  I've come to take back the reins of my show, 
         so you can just scoot out of there. [Roz comes in] 
  Niles: I think this might be a good time to go to a commercial. 
         [tosses Roz the blue “extra-long” cart, she plugs it in] 
         This is Dr. Niles Crane, “let's get better.” 
 He goes to commercial, pulls off his headphones, and stands. 
     Roz: [hesitantly] You OK, Frasier?  Your eyes look a little 
         glassy. 
Frasier: [dismissively] I'm fine!  It's just that the drugs I took 
         have some minor slide effects... 
 He settles into his chair, as Roz and Niles trade an alarmed look. 
Roz grabs his chair and wheels him to face her. 
     Roz: Frasier, look at me.  Do you see trails when I do this?  
 She splays her fingers and passes her hand repeatedly across his eyes. 
 Frasier: Whoa! [laughs] Ha!  It wasn't doing that before! 
 Niles holds Frasier’s gaze steady by taking hold of his chin. 
   Niles: Listen, you're not going on the air like this. [shakes 
         a finger in Frasier’s face] Stop it, stop...  
 Niles realizes Frasier is bobbing his head in time with Niles’s finger, 
and holds Frasier’s chin more tightly. 
   Niles: This is what you're going to do.  You're going to bed, you're 
         going to get rest, and you're going to get rid of this fever, 
         so you can be as good as new.  “Let's get better!”  All right? 
         [removes his fingers] All right? 
Frasier: [docilely, seeming appeased] All right... OK...  
 He stands, Niles and Roz start to lead him out of the booth. 
 Frasier: Maybe... maybe the two of you could help me find someone 
         to drive me home? 
    Roz: [opens the door] Oh, that's the most sensible thing you've 
         said so far, Frasier- 
 He shoves them both out the door and locks it.  
     Roz: [yelling] Frasier!  FRASIER! 
 She runs down the hall to her door even as Frasier rushes madly 
across his booth into hers.  He locks her door too, laughing 
wildly. 
 Frasier sits back down in his chair as he pulls the headphone on. 
Roz and Niles look in helplessly after banging on the door a few 
more times. 
 Frasier: Hello, Seattle, I'm back!  This is Dr. Frasier Crane. 
         I promise I  will never leave you again... so, let's 
         take our first caller. [presses a button] Hello, I'm 
         listening. 
 Robert: [v.o.] Hi, Dr. Crane.  Thanks for taking my call. 
         I'm a little nervous, okay?  My name is Robert. 
Frasier: And your name is? 
 Robert: ...My name is Robert. 
Frasier: Oh, I'm sorry.  We've already had a Robert on the show today. 
         Goodbye! 
 He presses a button to disconnect Robert.  Outside the booth, 
Roz is on the office phone. 
     Roz: Tony, it's Roz.  Could you get security up here?  Captain 
         Kirk's got control of the bridge and he's gone insane. 
 Inside the booth, Frasier is still on the air: 
 Frasier: Who is this? 
 Janice: I'm Janice. 
Frasier: Well, Janice, what's your problem? 
 Janice: Well, I'm having a problem breaking through a barrier with 
         my in-laws. 
Frasier: Boring!  
 He jabs another button and disconnects her, then picks up on another 
line. 
  Frasier: Hello!  You're on the crane with Frasier Air! 
Marjorie: Hi, Dr. Crane.  This is Marjorie.  You see, I'm... 
          I'm having a problem with my boss.  He doesn't seem to 
          respect me, and I don't have the courage to confront him. 
 Frasier: OK, OK, Marjorie.  Well, let's, let's see... Let's do a 
          little role-playing, OK?  Look, I'll be your boss, you be 
          yourself, you be Marjorie... and uh - come on in and talk 
          to me in a very forceful way.  Tell me what you think, and 
          you just might be surprised by what happens! 
Marjorie: Well, OK.  "Listen, Mr. Ross.  I've worked for this company 
          for six years and I've never missed a day.  But you've 
          constantly promoted people less qualified than I am, 
          and I don't think that's fair." 
 As she speaks, Frasier makes a shooing motion with his right hand 
and presumably starts seeing trails again.  He keeps waving his hand 
until she stops talking.  
  Frasier: "Well, Marjorie, I must say I admire your forthrightness, 
          and uh... I wished more of my employees came and spoke to 
          me with an open mind.  You know, you're going to get that 
          promotion!" 
Marjorie: Hey, that was great! 
 Frasier: [excited] Yeah!  Wasn't it?  Wasn't it?  OK, it's my turn! 
          I'm Marjorie and you're the boss now!  Come on!  Come on... 
 At this point, the door has been forced open and Niles comes in with 
some uniformed security guards.  
   Niles: [gently] Frasier, these nice men are going to take your 
         home. 
Frasier: [in dazed confusion] I'm - I'm, I'm doing my show! [a guard 
         takes the headphones off his ears] I can't!  I'm on the air! 
    Roz: No, you're not.  We cut you off.  You're on commercial. 
  Niles: Don't you worry your little mucous-filled head about 
         anything.  Everything's under control. 
 The guards have been slowly pushing Frasier out of the booth in his 
swivel chair. 
 Frasier: But it’s my show, it's my booth... [exiting the door] 
         Hey, this is fun!  Ha!  Make it go faster!  Whee! 
 As they wheel him out, Roz quickly shuts the door and checks the clock. 
     Roz: [urgently] Five seconds, Niles!  
 She rushes into her booth.  Niles puts on the headphones and 
Roz cues him by pointing. 
   Niles: Hello!  This is Dr. Niles Crane again and no, we haven't 
         taken leave of our senses.  That bit of inspired lunacy you 
         heard just before the commercial was just a little docudrama 
         Frasier and I put together on the dangers of over-medication. 
 At this point, we see Frasier in the hallway behind the studio, 
running wildly away as the guards chase him off the screen. 
Concerned, Roz looks after him.  
   Niles: Bravo, Frasier, for so brilliantly demonstrating why they call 
         it “dope!” 
 FADE TO: 
 Scene Four – Frasier’s Bedroom 
Frasier bolts awake, as he did earlier in the show, and starts yelling again.  
 Frasier: [hysterically] Daphne!  Daphne! 
 Daphne throws open the door again. 
  Daphne: Whaaat? 
Frasier: I had another dream!  I dreamt I went down to the station all 
         doped-up and tried to take over my show and made a big fool 
         out of myself, and they-they dragged me out of there like a 
         lunatic in a butterfly net! 
 Daphne: [comfortingly] Now, now, that was just a dream.  You 
         go back to sleep.  You'll feel better in the morning. 
 Soothed, he lays down again. 
 Frasier: Oh, Daphne.  Can I have a little lemonade?  With fresh 
         lemons and maybe a little sprig of mint? 
 Daphne: [sweetly] Anything you want. 
 Frasier falls back onto his bed, asleep.  Martin is waiting in the 
doorway. 
  Martin: Why'd you tell him it was a dream? 
 Daphne: No fun telling him the truth now, when he’s all doped up. 
         I'll wait till tomorrow morning - when he's good and lucid. 
 They laugh and exit. 
 End Of Act Two (Time: 22:00) 
 Credits:  
 We see Frasier seated in his booth, talking very normally into 
the mike.  He looks over toward Roz's booth, smiling, and the 
camera follows his gaze.  What we see seated there, on top of 
the console, is not Roz... but Eddie with the headphones on!  
 Suddenly, we see Roz jerking awake, freaked out.  She looks 
around her warily, then, relieved, she puts her headphones 
back on.
