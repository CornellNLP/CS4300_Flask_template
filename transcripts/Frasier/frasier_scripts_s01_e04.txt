 Act One. 
 I HATE FRASIER CRANE 
 Scene One - Frasier's Apartment. 
It's the early evening.  Frasier is playing a tune on the piano, 
Martin is looking through some old police work, and Daphne is 
busying herself in the kitchen.  Frasier turns round to find Eddie 
staring at him. 
 Frasier: Dad, he's doing it again!  Must this dog stare at me all the time? 
 Martin: I don't know.  Eddie - must ya? [Eddie carries on staring] 
         Apparently he must. 
Frasier: [to Eddie:] What is so fascinating about me?  What is it? 
         Do you imagine I am a large piece of kibble?  Am I some 
         sort of canine enigma?  Think about it, get back to me. 
 Daphne enters carrying a tray of food. 
  Daphne: Here we are, gents, dinner's up. [to Martin:] Can I give you 
         a hand clearing up your papers? 
 Martin: No, you better let me.  I need to keep these in a particular 
         order. 
 Daphne: What is all this, anyway? 
 Martin: Oh, it's an old case of mine from the police force - the 
         “Weeping Lotus" murder. 
Frasier: Dad, I can't believe you're still trotting this old thing up. 
         He's been trying to solve this case for twenty years. 
 Martin: Yeah, and I'm not stopping until I do solve it.  You adopt 
         certain instincts when you're a cop.  And my instinct tells 
         me that this case can be cracked.  There just must be one 
         small thing I keep overlooking. [tidies papers] 
Frasier: There is - who the murderer was. [laughs] 
 The doorbell sounds and Frasier goes to answer it as Daphne and 
Martin chat. 
  Daphne: It's nice you feel so dedicated. 
 Martin: It's a hobby.  Some guys build a boat in their garage, I try 
         to figure out why a maniac would kill a hooker and try to 
         stuff her entire body into a bowling bag.  It's relaxing! 
 At this point Frasier opens the front door to Niles who is carrying a 
bottle of wine.  He enters and hands the wine to Frasier. 
 Frasier: Hello, Niles. 
  Niles: Sorry I'm late, Frasier.  Just as we were leaving, Maris had a 
         run-in with a rude directory assistance operator and it 
         shattered her calm. 
Frasier: Have you ever considered that maybe Maris is a bit high 
         strung?  Maybe she should see someone. 
  Niles: She's seen everyone, why do you think she was calling 
         directory assistance? 
 Daphne: Evening, Dr. Crane. 
  Niles: Hello, Daphne.  It's so good to see you again. [she puts the 
         meal down] What an enchanting scent you're wearing. 
 Daphne: [smells herself] Must be the ranch dressing.  Won't Mrs. 
         Crane be coming? 
  Niles: No, I'm afraid.  And please, no more of this “Doctor” and “Mrs. 
         Crane” formality.  To you, it's Niles and... [stumped] er... 
Frasier: Maris. 
  Niles: Yes, Maris. 
 Martin: Glad you could join us, Niles. 
  Niles: Oh, I wouldn't have missed it. 
 Martin: Well, I guess the food's all ready: why don't we just go 
         ahead and start? 
 Everyone sits down except Daphne who begins to take her food into 
the kitchen. 
  Daphne: Well, enjoy. 
 Martin: Where are you going? 
 Daphne: I thought I'd have mine in the kitchen. 
 Martin: Don't be ridiculous. 
  Niles: Yes, we can't have you eating by yourself in the kitchen. 
         I'll join you. 
 Martin: No.  We're all eating right here, like a family, end of 
         discussion. 
 Daphne: Well, isn't this nice?  Feels just like home. 
  Niles: I'm famished. 
Frasier: Me, too. 
 Niles and Frasier begin to eat... 
  Martin: You boys still say a prayer before you eat? 
 They relent and pretend they do.  All four close their eyes and hold 
their hands together.  As Martin begins his prayer, Niles stares at 
Daphne as Eddie stares at Frasier.  Daphne does not notice with her 
eyes shut.  However, Frasier notices Eddie's skin-creeping look. 
  Martin: We thank you, Lord, for the food we're about to eat.  You have 
         blessed our table with your palm.  And thank you, Lord, for 
         bringing this family together and we also thank you for the 
         other gifts you have given to us.  And may we always be able 
         to share with those less fortunate... 
Frasier: [to Eddie:] OH, WILL YOU STOP STARING! 
  Niles: [off guard:] I wasn't staring! 
 Martin: [takes what he can get] Amen. 
 They all settle down.  Daphne looks at Niles a little suspiciously 
as he begins the meal conversation. 
   Niles: So Frasier, did you happen to read Derek Mann's column 
         today?  You were mentioned. 
Frasier: No, I missed it. 
  Niles: Just as well, it wasn't flattering. 
Frasier: I still would have liked to have seen it anyway. 
  Niles: Oh, why didn't you say so? [takes it out of his pocket] 
 Daphne: If I may ask, who's Derek Mann? 
 Martin: He writes that "Mann About Town" column for the Times.  The 
         things that guys comes out with, sometimes he's really funny 
         - what did he say about you? 
Frasier: [reading:] “I hate Frasier Crane.” 
 Martin: [laughs, then:] Oh, sorry. 
Frasier: That's it.  "I hate Frasier Crane."  That's it? 
 Martin: Oh, don't let it bother you. 
Frasier: Well, actually it doesn't, dad.  I knew when I chose a career 
         in the public eye that I'd be open to certain criticisms, 
         it's the price I pay for my celebrity.  Thank you, Niles, for 
         bringing me the paper, and thank you for highlighting it in 
         yellow!  Now, who would like some wine? 
 Daphne: Oh, I'll have some. 
 Frasier goes to pour some as Niles compliments Daphne. 
   Niles: Daphne, this salad is exquisite. 
Frasier: [sitting down:] Now why would he say that? 
 Martin: Must be the carrots, he always did like them. 
Frasier: Not the salad, Derek Mann.  I mean, why would he write a thing 
         like that?  I've never done anything to him, the attack is 
         totally unwarranted.  I'm a healer, for God's sake. 
 Martin: Oh, for crying out loud! 
Frasier: Dad, I have every right to feel upset about this - I will 
         not enjoy my dinner until this is where it belongs - in the 
         trash. 
 Frasier goes to bin it as Niles tries to stop him. 
   Niles: Oh, oh, there was an article in there I wanted to save. 
 Martin: On what? 
  Niles: Nothing. 
 Martin: Come on, I'm interested. 
  Niles: Oh, let's drop it. 
 Martin: Why can't you tell me? 
  Niles: All right, it was all about Margaret Thatcher's secret for 
         growing prize-winning zinnias.  Are you happy? 
 Martin: [beat] Not really. 
 FADE OUT 
 OH, YEAH... 
 Scene Two - Radio Station. 
The following afternoon Frasier is taking a call on air in his booth 
as Roz listens. 
  Frasier: All right, Lorraine.  Now, calm down and try and listen to 
          what I'm going to say to you.  Will you do that? 
Lorraine: [v.o:] Okay. 
 Frasier: All right, good girl.  Now your problem... 
Lorraine: [beep] Oh my gosh, another call waiting - someone else is 
          trying to get through.  Do you mind if I take it? 
 Frasier: No, no.  Go right ahead. [she does] Well, certainly a very 
          interesting situation she's got herself into.  Don't you 
          think so, Roz? 
 Roz is busy eating and reading magazines.  She has to quickly chew her 
food, put down her books just for the simple: 
      Roz: Yes. 
Lorraine: Okay, I'm back. 
 Frasier: All right, Lorraine.  Now listen very carefully to what I'm 
          going to tell you.  Your problem seems... 
Lorraine: [beep] Oh, I'm sorry, I'll be right back. 
 Frasier: For someone who's got so many problems she certainly is 
          popular. [laughs] 
Lorraine: Okay, go ahead Dr. Crane.  I'm here. [beep] Oh, I don't 
          believe it - another call. 
 Frasier: Hold it there, Lorraine.  The reason why you want to take 
          that other call is the same reason that you want to change 
          your career and break up with your boyfriend.  You're 
          obsessed with what you think you're missing.  The better 
          offer, the call on the other line.  Well, you've got to take 
          one call at a time from now on.  Fully explore and 
          experience each one in its turn and you'll be a stronger 
          person for it.  Do you follow me, Lorraine? 
Lorraine: Okay, I'm back! 
 Frasier: Thank you for your call. [hangs up] Well, we've only got 
          two minutes left, so I would like to end today's program on 
          a personal note.  As some of you may know, yesterday I was 
          mentioned in Derek Mann's "Mann About Town" column.  He 
          said, and I quote, "I Hate Frasier Crane"... "I Hate Frasier 
          Crane". [sarcastic:] What trenchant criticism.  Move aside 
          Voltaire, step back in the shadows H.L. Mencken, there's a 
          new kid in town.  One can only wonder how many hours Derek 
          Mann sat in the glow of his computer screen before his 
          trembling fingers sprang to life and pecked out this chef 
          t'ouerve: "I Hate Frasier Crane."  A lesser critic would 
          have wasted our time by presenting a well thought-out, 
          point by point, constructive critique of this show.  No, not 
          our Mr. Mann.  So dear listeners, when Mr. Mann's column 
          arrives on your front doorstep - read it, enjoy it, but 
          above all, treasure it.  For one day this man will be joining 
          the Pantheon of the immortals.  And if we're lucky... it'll be 
          one day soon.  I'm Dr. Frasier Crane. [signs off] 
 Frasier presses the off air button, and twirls his microphone around 
before blowing on it as if it were his weapon, then “holsters” it 
in his belt. 
 FADE TO:  
 YEAH! 
 Scene Three - Café Nervosa. 
The following afternoon Frasier is drinking a coffee in the café with 
Roz when Niles enters and sits with him. 
   Niles: Frasier, how funny running into you here. 
Frasier: I'm always here. 
  Niles: Yes well, you weren't here twenty minutes ago: have you seen 
         today's "Times"? 
Frasier: [knowing what's coming:] No. 
  Niles: Lucky for you I saved you this copy.  Take a look at Derek 
         Mann's column. 
Frasier: You know, this is the second time in as many days that you 
         have given me a paper.  Have you ever considered getting 
         yourself a route? 
  Niles: [to Roz:] Hello, I don't believe we've met. 
    Roz: Yes we have, Niles, three or four times.  Roz Doyle. 
  Niles: Oh, of course.  It was at the... it was during the... well, I'm far 
         too successful to feel awkward.  Where did we meet? 
    Roz: The radio station. 
  Niles: Ah, I'll take your word for it.  Nice to see you again. [then, 
         to Frasier:] Mr. Mann heard your program yesterday. 
Frasier: So I see. [reading:] “Yesterday afternoon, Dr. Frasier Crane 
         got on my case for not giving him a point by point criticism 
         of his radio show.  Well, he asked for it, so here goes.” 
    Roz: [noticing:] Oh my god, his entire column is about your show. 
  Niles: Not very flattering either.  Towards the end he even attacks 
         your "dimwitted sidekick call screener." 
    Roz: [appalled:] That's me! 
  Niles: Oh, now I remember you! 
Frasier: [reading:] “It's hard to say what I hate most about Crane's 
         show – his pompous, sanctimonious style, his constant self- 
         congratulatory references to his own life, or his voice: a mock- 
         sympathetic tone so sickly sweet one wonders if the man 
         graduated from medical school or from some mind-controlling 
         cult.” 
  Niles: It's continued on twelve. 
Frasier: I've read enough! 
 Waiter: [asking:] Can I get you something? 
Frasier: [to Niles:] How can the man think something like that? 
 Waiter: It's my job, I'm a waiter. 
Frasier: We don't want anything, thank you. 
    Roz: Frasier, I know this stinks, but in a couple of days it'll 
         blow over. 
Frasier: Oh, perhaps you're right.  As angry as it makes me, to 
         retaliate would be to stoop to his level.  So the best 
         response is no response at all. 
 FADE TO:  
 Scene Four - Radio Station. 
Soon after these comments he is already shouting into his microphone 
about the recent newspaper report. 
 Frasier: [angry:] “Pompous and sanctimonious,” am I?!  Well, this Mann 
         character can't even write grammatical sentences!  Every 
         five words there's one of his precious "dot, dot, dots." 
         Must be because he likes writing all those dots with the 
         crayon he writes this drivel in! 
 Roz, who looks like she has been listening to him rant for quite 
a while, tries to steer him back to the show. 
     Roz: Dr. Crane, on line two we have Stewart who's having a 
         problem with delayed gratification. 
Frasier: Well, he's just going to have to wait!  I don't know who this 
         Derek Mann thinks he is, but if he thinks he can hide behind 
         his newspaper like some sniveling schoolchild cowering 
         behind a tree, then I say let's expose this Derek Mann for 
         what he is: not a man at all, but half a man! [to Roz:] Now 
         what line did you say Stewart was on? 
    Roz: He hung up. 
Frasier: Well, I'm leaving all sorts of bodies in my wake today. 
         Let's see who's on line five. [he presses button:] Hello, 
         this is Dr. Frasier Crane - I'm listening. 
  Derek: [v.o:] Good, because I was listening too. 
Frasier: And you are? 
  Derek: Derek Mann. 
Frasier: [regretting:] I see. 
  Derek: Look, nobody calls me half a man - especially some Ivy League 
         twit.  So what do you say we settle this like men? 
Frasier: Are you implying that you want to fight me? 
  Derek: I'm not implying, I'm saying. 
Frasier: Fight, as in a fist fight? 
  Derek: [sarcastic:] No, I thought we might throw pies at each 
         other!  So are you up to it, or aren't you man enough? 
Frasier: [thinks] We'll be right back after these messages. 
 Frasier signs off for commercials as we fade out. 
 End Of Act One. (Time: 11:05) 
 Act Two. 
 Scene One - Radio Station. 
The scene resumes where we left off.  The commercials have finished 
and Frasier gets back to his radio show. 
 Frasier: And we're back.  Well, we have a surprise caller on the line: 
         Derek Mann. 
  Derek: [v.o:] So what's it going to be, Crane, are you going to 
         fight me or not? 
Frasier: Oh, you can't be serious. 
  Derek: Just like I figured, you're chicken. 
Frasier: No, I just don't think that civilized people behave that 
         way.  You know, Roz, perhaps our listeners have an opinion 
         about that subject?  Who do we have on the line? 
    Roz: Well, lines one through eight are people who think you're chicken. 
  Derek: You're chicken, Crane.  Admit it! 
Frasier: I am not chicken! 
  Derek: [squawks like a chicken] 
Frasier: We are mature thinking people, not cavemen! 
  Derek: [squawks some more] 
Frasier: Alright, if you want a fight so bad, I'll give you a fight! 
         You just say the time and place! 
  Derek: Kinsley square, right outside your office, by the old 
         statue.  Noon tomorrow.  Don't back out! 
Frasier: I won't!  Don't you back out either because I know where your 
         office is too, and I know where you live, and I'll track you 
         down!  Now who else out there wants a piece of me?! 
 FADE TO: 
 ET TU, EDDIE? 
 Scene Two - Frasier's Apartment. 
That evening Martin is searching through his old case as Daphne 
passes him. 
  Daphne: Having a look at that old murder case again? 
 Martin: Yeah, I've dug out the old crime scene photos. 
 Daphne: Well, don't be a greedy guts - let me have a look. 
 Daphne has a look at the photo of the girl.  After a while her psychic 
powers kick in. 
  Daphne: Her name was Helen. 
 Martin: Yeah, it was. [knowing her trick:] Ah, you must have seen it 
         on some of my papers I've had lying around here. 
 Daphne: No, I just got this feeling when I touched the picture. 
 Martin: You're putting me on. 
 Daphne: She had a lot of men in her life. 
 Martin: No kidding: she was a hooker! 
 Daphne: No, I mean she had four brothers. 
 Martin: [surprised:] That's amazing.  She did have four brothers. 
         What else are you getting?  Well, come on, tell me more. 
 Daphne: I can't just turn it on and off like a faucet. 
 Martin: Give it a try, will you?  Please.  What else are you getting? 
 Daphne: Nothing. [suddenly:] No, wait.  I see a man. 
 Martin: Yeah? 
 Daphne: A well-dressed man.  He's wearing wing tips and a trench coat. 
 Martin: Yeah?  Yeah? 
 Daphne: He's getting off an elevator... he's walking down a long 
         hallway... she doesn't know he's coming... he's opening the 
         door... 
 At this moment, a well-dressed man enters the apartment wearing wing 
tips and a trench coat - it's Frasier. 
 Frasier: Hello, everyone. 
 Daphne: Sometimes I get my signals crossed. 
Frasier: What's going on? 
 Martin: Well - unless you killed a hooker when you were twelve - 
         nothing much! 
 Daphne: We heard your show today.  I just loved the way you handled 
         that Derek Mann. 
 Martin: You made your old man proud.  Yet the best part was when he 
         challenged you to a fight and you stood right up to him. 
Frasier: [worried:] Yes I did, didn't I? 
 Martin: I can't wait to see that. 
Frasier: Oh, I'm not actually going to go through with it, dad. 
 Martin: What are you talking about? 
Frasier: Well, I already won our little war of words.  What would I 
         stand to benefit by going through with actually going 
         through with a fist fight? 
 Martin: Frasier, maybe I'm misunderstanding here... he challenged 
         you and you're backing down? 
Frasier: Well, mature people are supposed to use their intellect to 
         settle their differences. 
 Martin: A man doesn't just turn his tail and run - that's not the 
         way I brought you up. 
Frasier: Are you encouraging me to fight? 
 Martin: You bet I am - you gave the guy your word. 
Frasier: Yes, but I didn't even know what I was saying - I hadn't even 
         had lunch yet. 
 Martin: I might have known this would have happened.  It's Billy Kreizel 
         all over again. 
Frasier: What did you say? 
 Martin: Something about a Billy Kreizel, I believe. 
Frasier: I can't believe you're dragging that up - that was thirty 
         years ago. 
 Daphne: Who's this Billy Kreizel? 
Frasier: Oh, he was this kid in fifth grade that used to torment me! 
 Martin: So one day Frasier made fun of Billy's crewcut. 
Frasier: Well, he started it by making fun of the elbow patches on my 
         blazer! 
 Martin: Well, the point is, they were supposed to meet for a fight 
         after school.  Only "Patches" here didn't show up! 
Frasier: I had a clarinet lesson! 
 Martin: You don't need to remind me of that!  Billy's old man was a 
         cop, too.  Boy, the guys rode me about that excuse of yours for 
         years.  Every time I couldn't make it out for a drink they 
         used to say, "What's the matter?  You got a clarinet lesson?" 
 Daphne: [wondering:] Couldn't you and Billy have met after the 
         clarinet lesson? 
Frasier: Daphne, would you please excuse us for a moment! 
 Daphne: [gets up:] I have a feeling I'm going to be excused quite a 
         lot in this house.  
 She exits to the kitchen. 
 
 
 
 Frasier: [sarcastic:] Dad, I am sorry if I embarrassed you for not 
         fighting Billy Kreizel thirty years ago.  But the situation 
         is not the same now. 
 Martin: It's exactly the same. 
Frasier: I am an adult now, I've been to medical school, I hold a 
         certain position in this city - I do not settle my 
         differences with brawling. 
 Martin: The man challenged you and you accepted. 
Frasier: Dad, I can't believe this.  You won't be happy until I come 
         home with a black eye. 
 Martin: I just want you to do what you said you were going to do. 
         You know, you can talk about your medical school, your 
         intellect, your place in this city, but you know what?  It's 
         all one big clarinet lesson... I can't even look at you. 
 Martin exits to the kitchen, angry with his son.  Frasier is left with 
little dignity and looks at Eddie for a little support.  However, even 
Eddie turns his face away from him.  Frasier can only sulk. 
 [N.B. Billy Kreizel is the name of a boy who bullied director David Lee 
in the sixth grade.] 
 FADE TO: 
 REQUIEM FOR A LIGHTWEIGHT 
 Scene Three - Café Nervosa. 
The next day, Frasier is preparing for the big fight whilst chatting 
with Roz. 
     Roz: So, I step out of the shower, I look out of the window and I 
         notice the garbage man looking right in at me.  So I say, 
         "Did you get a good look?"  And he says, "Not completely, 
         turn around."  Then he smiled, and he's missing a tooth, 
         and that's when the romance went right out of it for me. 
Frasier: Roz, why are you telling me this story? 
    Roz: I'm trying to take your mind of the fact that in five 
         minutes you're going to walk right out into that square and 
         get your clock cleaned. 
Frasier: Well, has it ever occurred to you that I might actually win 
         this fight? 
    Roz: Your shoe’s untied. [Frasier checks his tied shoes] If you 
         fell for that one, you're going down and you're going down 
         hard. 
  Niles: [enters] Frasier, there's quite a crowd forming out there. 
         Secretaries with bag lunches, business men, children with 
         balloons... 
Frasier: All that's missing is a mariachi band. 
  Niles: They're setting up. 
    Roz: Well, I better go find a great place in the crowd.  I'll be 
         off to the left, Frasier, for when you tear his ear off and 
         want to throw it to a beautiful senorita. 
 She leaves the Café.  Niles looks at Frasier. 
   Niles: Frasier, as your brother and as your friend - why are you 
         doing this? 
Frasier: It's Billy Kreizel. 
  Niles: [looking around:] Where? 
Frasier: [shakes head] He's not here, Niles.  It's just that I ran away 
         from him when I was ten. 
  Niles: I remember. 
Frasier: You know, I've been running ever since.  You know, this is 
         where it stops.  I'm not running anymore. 
  Niles: What is it that makes us Crane boys such targets? 
 As he says this, he takes his nail file out of his coat pocket 
and buffs his nails.  He blows on them and offers the file to 
Frasier which he refuses. 
 Frasier: [sarcastic:] Chalk it up to random violence! 
 Niles nods in agreement and exits the café.  Martin enters. 
  Martin: Hey, there. 
Frasier: Dad?  What are you doing here? 
 Martin: Look son, I said a couple of things last night that maybe 
         went over the line. 
Frasier: Look dad, if you were worried that you talked me into 
         something that I wasn't ready to do – well, you're wrong. 
         You can relax.  I took this on for myself. 
 Martin: Good. 
Frasier: Who told you that I was going through with it, anyway? 
 Martin: Oh, let's just say a father knows certain things about his son.  
 They smile.  Daphne enters. 
  Daphne: Good news, I parked in front of a broken meter.  We're getting 
         a freebie.  Well, good luck, Dr. Crane, with the fight. 
Frasier: Thank you, Daphne.  Any psychic predictions on the outcome? 
 Daphne: Actually, yes.  But don't worry, I'm frequently wrong. 
 Frasier removes his jacket and tie.  Niles comes in. 
   Niles: Frasier, Frasier, there's something I want you to see. 
         [points out of window:] There, the man standing to the left 
         of the statue - I recognize his picture from the newspaper, 
         that's Derek Mann. 
Frasier: He's gigantic! 
 Daphne: [looking out:] My God, you could show a movie on his back! 
 Martin: Are you sure you want to go through with this? 
Frasier: Yes, yes I am. 
 Frasier throws a few shadow punches to loosen himself up. 
  Martin: Good, you'll be fine.  Just remember this is a street fight 
         and not a boxing match.  So fight dirty and throw the first 
         punch! 
 Daphne: I found that a swift knee to the groin usually does the 
         trick. [cocky:] If you have any doubts, check with a fellow 
         in Manchester named Nigel Tavers. 
  Niles: [begins to leave:] Well, if we want an unobstructed view... 
Frasier: [stops him:] Look, I prefer if you guys stay here.  You'll 
         only make me nervous. 
 Martin: Whatever you want. 
 They all wish Frasier good luck.  As he exits the mariachi band 
strikes up.  They all move over to the window to look out. 
  Martin: They've got a mariachi band out there! 
  Niles: I'll have to get their card, I need someone for our summer 
         barbeque. 
 Daphne: Oh look, they’re starting the fight. 
 Martin: Nah, they’re just circling, sizing each other up.  Come on, 
         Frasier, if you're going to hit him, hit him now! 
 They all shout encouragements, then police sirens are heard. 
   Niles: Is that the police? 
 Martin: Yeah, what are they doing here? 
 Daphne: They're breaking it up!  Just when they were getting started. 
 Shouts are heard from the crowd hurling insults at the police force. 
The officer marches Frasier right into the Café. 
 Frasier: Alright, I'll come along peacefully - let me just get my 
         jacket. 
Officer: Relax, I'm not arresting you.  But I'm warning you that in 
         this town we don't settle our differences with street fights 
         - no matter who you are. 
Frasier: Well thank you, officer, you'll have no more trouble from me. 
Officer: Okay. [exits] 
Frasier: Dad, dad, did you see me?  My hands are trembling, my chest 
         is pounding, my mouth is all dry, my knees are like jello... 
         God, I feel great! 
 Martin: You did good. 
Frasier: Yeah, I was out there.  I was raring to go, you saw that... 
 Martin: I know you were.  You would have kicked his butt! 
 Daphne: From here to Tacoma. 
  Niles: [shouting:] I think we should celebrate!  Everyone, a round 
         of victory lattes on me.  
 As the gang celebrate, Martin walks up to the officer on the door. 
  Martin: Thanks Harry, I owe you one. 
Officer: No problem, Marty. 
 Martin: You cut it pretty close, though.  Another minute, then Frasier 
         would have been sidewalk litter.  He would have been lunch 
         meat. 
Officer: Say, some of the guys are getting together later at Duke’s. 
         Why don't you come along? 
 Martin: Yeah, maybe I will.  And you know why I will?  Because the 
         Crane boys don't take clarinet lessons anymore. 
Officer: What the hell are you talking about? 
 Martin: [embarrassed:] Oh that's right, you weren't in my precinct. 
 End Of Act Two. (Time: 21:10)
