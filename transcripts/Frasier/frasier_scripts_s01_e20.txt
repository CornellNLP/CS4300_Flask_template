 Act One. 
 Scene One: The Frasier Crane Show. 
Frasier is at his console. 
 Frasier: [on-air] Hello, Rachel.  I'm listening. 
 Rachel: [v.o.] Oh, thanks for taking my call, Dr. Crane.  Um, I'm 
         involved in sort of a strange love triangle. 
Frasier: [off-air, to Roz] Oh goody, this is sweeps week! [on-air] 
 Rachel: You see, I recently married a widower.  Now, Phil's a real 
         good man, he's a kind man.  But there's just one little 
         problem.  He insists on keeping an urn with his late wife's 
         ashes on the dresser in our bedroom. 
Frasier: That is a definite “Yikes.” 
 Rachel: See, I knew that wasn't normal.  He says it is, but I knew 
         it wasn't! 
Frasier: All right, Rachel, Rachel, now listen.  Before you go off 
         half-cocked, let's try to remember this is a very sensitive 
         issue for your husband.  Obviously those ashes mean a very 
         great deal to him.  And although I don't believe it's 
         appropriate that he keep them in the bedroom, I suppose you 
         could maybe move them to another room? 
 Rachel: Well, I guess I could try that.  Maybe I'll move them into 
         the guest room. [sound of crockery breaking] Oops. 
Frasier: Rachel, what happened? 
 Rachel: Oh... oh, nothing.  I gotta run, Dr. Crane.  I've got some 
         vacuuming to do.  
 The line goes dead. 
 Frasier: Well, as Rachel helps Phil's wife off the floor, we have 
         reached the end of our second hour.  Now, we'll be right back 
         after the news, so please join me again, Frasier Crane and my 
         invaluable producer... ah... [ohmygod, what's her name?  It's, 
         it's...] 
    Roz: ROZ! 
Frasier: Roz!  KACL Talk radio, 780 AM.  
 He goes off the air, and goes into Roz's area. 
 Frasier: Roz, I'm so sorry.  Your name was right there in front of me 
         and I just couldn't put my finger on it. 
    Roz: Oh, forget about it.  I already have. 
Frasier: Well, it's been happening to me a lot lately.  Last night I 
         walked into the kitchen and I just stood there.  I couldn't 
         remember what I'd gone in there for. 
    Roz: Don't make yourself crazy over it, it's completely normal. 
         Oh, by the way, you hair stylist called to confirm your 
         appointment. 
Frasier: I made an appointment with Timo?  I don't remember that. 
    Roz: That's 'cause you didn't, I was just gas-lighting you. 
Frasier: That is not funny! 
    Roz: Oh, lighten up.  Here, sign these. [hand him some forms] So 
         aren't you gonna say it, or are you going to make me wait 'til 
         the end of the day? 
Frasier: Say what? 
    Roz: Happy birthday. 
Frasier: It is not your birthday. [sees her stricken face] Oh, God. 
         Oh God, it is.  Oh, oh Roz, I'm so sorry!  Let me take you 
         out to lunch after work, okay? 
    Roz: [laughing] You are so easy! 
Frasier: That's it.  I'm outta here! [exits into corridor] 
    Roz: Hey, wait, wait, wait.  Aren't you forgetting something? 
Frasier: No, I am not forgetting anything, thank you, Roz.  
 He walks away. 
     Roz: Okay.  Well, can't blame a girl for trying.  Five, four, 
         three... 
 Frasier rushes back to his console.  
     Roz: Two... 
Frasier: [on air] We're back. 
 FADE OUT 
 THE SHORT BLONDE MAN 
WITH ONE WET SHOE 
 Scene Two: Frasier's apartment. 
Martin and Niles are playing Canasta.  Eddie is worrying Niles's shoe. 
   Niles: Ten. 
 Martin: Fifteen-two. 
  Niles: No! [then] Dad, would you ask your dog to stop burrowing 
         at my shoes?  I'll have you know I had to wait six months 
         to have these shipped for a little blind cobbler in Seville. 
 Martin: He won't stop until you scratch him behind the ear. 
  Niles: Oh, all right Eddie, all right.  
 He wraps a finger in his handkerchief and scratches Eddie's ear. 
Eddie runs off, contented. 
   Niles: You know, I'm beginning to this I have an affinity towards 
         animals.  
 He goes to throw the handkerchief away.  Frasier enters from his bedroom. 
 Frasier: Would either of you mind if I noodled at the piano for a bit? 
  Niles: Would it really stop you if we said “Yes?” 
Frasier: Point well taken.  
 He sits at the piano and starts to play, but loses the tune at around 
the sixth bar.  
 Frasier: That's strange.  For the life of me, I can't remember what the 
         next note is. [tries again, but stumbles at the same point] I 
         know this piece backwards and forwards. 
  Niles: Perhaps if you start at the end you'll have better luck. 
 Frasier tries again, but is still stuck. 
  Martin: Oh, come on Frasier.  You know how it goes.  It goes, “da dada 
         da da, da dada...” 
Frasier: Oh, thank you dad.  Now it's perfectly clear. [tries once 
         more, then gives up in disgust] 
 Martin: That was very nice, son.  Now how about something from “South 
         Pacific?” 
Frasier: I'm sorry.  Just getting fed up with this nonsense.  I'm 
         forgetting names all the time.  You know, last week, twice 
         I forgot where I parked my car. 
 Martin: Join the club, pal.  You're getting older. 
Frasier: Oh, well of course I'm getting older.  We're all getting 
         older.  But I'm not that old. 
  Niles: Oh, I'm afraid dad may have a point.  I know you'd like to 
         believe we're still the same devilish sprigs we always were. 
         Sitting on mother's davenport in our tweeds and tans, listening 
         to the Texaco symphonic hour.  The cold-hearted reality is, 
         you're middle-aged. 
Frasier: Niles, I'm forty-one.  That's hardly middle-aged.  Middle age 
         is more like fifty, fifty-five. 
  Niles: Only if you live to be one hundred and ten. 
 Daphne enters from bedroom, putting on her coat. 
  Daphne: I'm all ready to go, Dr. Crane. 
Frasier: Niles, where are you two off to? 
  Niles: I'm giving Daphne a lift. 
 Daphne: I'm meeting some of my girlfriends for darts and a couple of 
         pints.  Oh, it's best to do it in that order.  Just ask Blind 
         Willie, the bartender. 
Frasier: Listen Daphne, before you go, I'd like to ask you a little 
         question here.  When you look at me, um, do you see me as a 
         young man, or as an older man? 
 Daphne: Oh, no.  No, you don't.  You're not getting me into that 
         Vietnam.  I learned a long time ago there are three questions 
         you never answer honestly.  “How old do I look?”  “Do you like 
         my hair?” and “Was it good for you too?” [to Niles] Coming, 
         Dr. Crane? ...Dr. Crane? 
  Niles: I'm sorry, I was someplace else. [to Frasier] It was a warm 
         and friendly place.  
 He and Daphne leave. 
 Frasier: Big surprise, I got a headache.  Let me get an aspirin.  The 
         very suggestion that I'm descending into old age just because 
         I can't remember a couple of names, or a tune on the piano.  
 He takes a medicine bottle out of the cupboard, but has trouble 
reading the label. 
  Martin: Your arm's not quite long enough for that, is it?  Let me ask 
         you a few questions.  Can you get through the night without 
         getting up to go to the john?  Can you get in and out of a 
         chair without going “Mmmm?”  Can you eat a slice of pizza less 
         than twelve hours before you go to bed? 
Frasier: [after a beat] What's on the pizza? 
 Martin: A-ha.  I thought so.  Alright, well now we've established 
         you're middle-aged.  Take some advice: don't fight it, it'll 
         go a lot easier. 
Frasier: Good lord, dad, what are you suggesting?  I'm gonna rush off 
         to a plastic surgeon to get an eye lift and a chin tuck? 
         [examines his face in a silver plate] Oh, dear god! 
 Martin: [looking in family album] I'm just telling you, when guys get 
         to this stage they do some squirrelly things that they never 
         would have done when they were younger. 
Frasier: Dad, please spare me, I am a psychiatrist, I know the routine. 
         [notices the photograph Martin is pointing to] Good lord, who 
         is that? 
 Martin: That's me.  In '74.  Going through my own little stage.  I'd 
         dyed my hair jet black and bought a leather jacket and a 
         Harley Davidson. 
Frasier: My God, dad.  You look like one of the Village People. 
 Martin: Well, fortunately I came to my senses before you got back from 
         Harvard that summer. 
Frasier: Are those love beads? 
 Martin: All right, that's enough.  Just do me a favour, will ya?  Keep 
         your guard up, and don't do something stupid, all right? 
Frasier: Okay, dad. 
 Martin: You may think it's tough being middle-aged, but think about 
         me.  I got a son who's middle-aged.  
 He exits to his bedroom as Frasier settles onto the couch. 
 Frasier: Ahhhh... 
 Martin: [o.s.] I heard that! 
 End Of Act One. 
 Act Two. 
 IT'S THIS OR AN ALFA ROMEO 
 Scene One: Department store, gents casual. 
Frasier and Martin enter. 
  Martin: Say, didn't this used to be Pinski's department store? 
Frasier: I have no idea. 
 Martin: Sure it was.  we used to bring you kids here all the time. 
         Man, it was a great store.  You could buy lingerie, a bag of 
         popcorn and transmission fluid, all under the same roof. 
Frasier: Finally, something I'm glad I forgot. 
 Daphne enters. 
  Daphne: Well, Mr. Crane, I believe I came here on a mission. 
 Martin: Alright, but remember, I don't want anything fancy or that 
         comes in tubes.  I want them white, I want them plain, and 
         I want them boxers. 
 Daphne: That's the exactly the kind of lack of imagination that sunk 
         the British Empire.  
 She goes off to look at underwear. 
  Martin: Hey, Frasier.  Check out these dress pants.  They got elastic 
         panels in the waist.  You could eat all you want, and never 
         worry about cutting off your circulation. 
Frasier: Milan must be beside itself.  What an innovative use of 
         synthetic fibres.  I believe if you recycle these, you can 
         turn them into milk containers. 
 Martin: Are you gonna get them or not? 
Frasier: You brought these over for me?! 
 Martin: Hey, the sands of time are shifting, buddy - mostly south! 
         Listen, if you don't want to go with elastic, maybe you could 
         go with suspenders.  That way, if you keep your jacket closed, 
         that little gut of yours can hang down to here and nobody’s 
         any the wiser. 
Frasier: I do not have a gut! [looks at himself sideways in the mirror] 
         I have... contours. 
 A salesgirl (Carrie) comes over. 
  Carrie: Excuse me. I was wondering if anyone was helping you? 
 Martin: [seeing Daphne] Oh, no.  She's looking at something with 
         stripes! [goes over] Daphne!  Daphne, get away from there! 
 Carrie: [to Frasier, indicating elastic pants] You're not thinking 
         of getting those, are you? 
Frasier: Oh, no. 
 Carrie: I have something much better over here. [gets another pair] 
         What do you think of these?  They don't do much on the hanger 
         but, they could really work on a nice, tall guy like you. 
Frasier: Oh, you really think so? 
 Carrie: Yeah.  You've got a great build. 
Frasier: Oh, well.  Thank you very much, ah...? 
 Carrie: Carrie. 
Frasier: Ah, Carrie. 
 Carrie: Let's see what we can get working here.  Um, [picks up sweater] 
         This is kind of a young look, but you could really pull it off. 
Frasier: ...I don't really think it's me. 
 Carrie: Are you sure?  I think this would look really good on you. 
Frasier: Well, I suppose I could try it on.  But you know, just out of 
         curiosity, how old do you think I am? 
 Carrie: Oh, I don't want to do that. 
Frasier: No, no, no, please go ahead. 
 Carrie: I don't know.  Um... thirty-six? 
Frasier: Are you serious? 
 Carrie: Oh, God.  I'm sorry.  You're probably more like thirty-four. 
         Now you don't want to buy anything from me. 
Frasier: Are those Armani shirts expensive? 
 Carrie: Yeah. 
Frasier: I'll take two! 
 Carrie: Great!  Changing room's right this way.  You know, I love to 
         guess what my customers do by what they wear.  Let me guess. 
         You're an architect, right? 
Frasier: No, I'm a psychiatrist. 
 Carrie: Oh.  I've taken some psychiatry courses.  What are you, 
         Freudian?  Reichian? 
Frasier: Well actually, lately I've been leaning more towards Jung. 
         Guess that's because I'm “Jung at heart.”  
 They both laugh. 
 [N.B. This episode was apparently written before the establishment of 
the Freud/Jung rivalry between Frasier and Niles.] 
 Frasier: Gotta be the oldest joke in the psychiatrist's joke book. 
         Can't believe I said it. [goes into changing booth] 
 Carrie: I can't believe I laughed at that. 
Frasier: I bet you laugh at all of your customer’s jokes. 
 Carrie: No.  Just the cute ones. 
Frasier: ...Cute jokes or customers? 
 Carrie: You figure it out. [leaves] 
 Time lapse.  
 Carrie points Martin to Frasier's changing booth.  He goes over. 
  Martin: Hey, you about ready? 
Frasier: Oh, just a second, dad, I'm trying on a pair of pants.  Hey, 
         did you notice that girl who came over and asked to help us 
         earlier? 
 Martin: Sure I noticed her.  I'm not dead. 
Frasier: Well you know, we just had a little conversation a minute ago 
         and uh, I could swear she was flirting with me. 
 Martin: [taking a good look at Carrie] Trust me son, she's on 
         commission. 
Frasier: Oh no, I know a sales pitch when I hear one, and that was no 
         sales pitch.  She's definitely interested in me.  Think I may 
         have to see where this may lead. 
 Martin: I know you're forgetting things lately, but don't you remember 
         the little talk we had last night? 
Frasier: [realizing] Oh, dear.  It sneaks right up on you, doesn't it? 
         What am I thinking about?  A forty-one year-old man going out 
         with a girl that's twenty-two, twenty-three? 
 Martin: Yeah.  Young enough to be your daughter. 
Frasier: Yes, thank you for pointing that out, dad. 
 FADE TO: 
 Scene Two: KACL radio station. 
Frasier is doing his show. 
 Frasier: [on air] This is Dr Frasier Crane, KACL 780 talk radio, 
         thanking you for joining us today.  Up next, Bob “Bulldog” 
         Briscoe and the “Gonzo Sports Show.”  Until tomorrow, here's 
         wishing you good mental health. [off air] 
 Bulldog enters with his effects trolley. 
 Bulldog: Hey, doc.  Hear the great news?  Ken Griffey Junior's groin 
         pull is completely healed. 
Frasier: Thank goodness. I'm sure years from now we'll all remember 
         where we were the moment we heard the joyful news. 
 Carrie enters, carrying a garment bag. 
  Carrie: Excuse me, Dr. Crane? 
Frasier: Hi, Carrie. 
 Carrie: Hi. I have your pants. 
Bulldog: Whoa, doc! [honks horn] Where'd you leave them? 
Frasier: They're new, Bulldog.  Some of the finer department stores 
         deliver garments to their busier customers. 
 Carrie: Actually, we don't.  I just thought it would be nice to see 
         you again. 
Bulldog: [to Carrie] Excuse me.  You look very familiar.  Didn't I let 
         you pour a flaming tequila shooter down my throat at Sloppy 
         Nick’s during ah, last year’s Indy 500? 
 Carrie: Ah, no. 
Bulldog: Well, what are you doing next Memorial Day? 
Frasier: Bulldog, as certain as I am that any young lady in the world 
         would love to set your face on fire, Carrie, I believe, is 
         here to see me. 
Bulldog: Okay.  Hey, you can't blame a dog for trying. [going into Roz's 
         booth] Just on the off chance it might make a difference, I ah, 
         drive a '94 Camaro. 
 He exits. 
  Carrie: Is he gay? [Frasier looks at her, surprised] Well, I've been 
         studying about this in school, and it seems like he's really 
         overcompensating. 
Frasier: Yes, well, I'm not sure. [smiles] But I certainly look forward 
         to running that theory by him.  Well um, thank you for the 
         pants, Carrie, and uh, do I owe you anything? 
 Carrie: Oh, no.  I really enjoyed meeting you yesterday, and it seemed 
         like we had a few laughs together and, maybe we could, you 
         know, go out and have a cup of coffee sometime? 
Frasier: I'm very flattered that you'd like to go out with me, and uh, 
         jeez, I think you're a beautiful young woman.. 
 Carrie: But? 
Frasier: Well it's, it's our ages.  I mean, how old are you? 
 Carrie: Twenty-two.  How old are you? 
Frasier: That's not polite.  I just don't think it would be appropriate 
         for us to date. 
 Carrie: How about we just live together? [then] I'm just trying to 
         lighten an uncomfortable moment. 
Frasier: Right.  Ha-ha.  Well done. 
 Carrie: Well, I'm sorry.  But if you change your mind you know where I 
         am.  Enjoy your pants. 
Frasier: Same to you. 
 Carrie leaves. Bulldog comes back. 
 Bulldog: I only got a second here, but... [raps on Frasier's forehead, 
         hard] HELLO?  ANYONE THERE? [Roz enters] She wanted to go out 
         with you.  You didn't have to chase her.  You didn't have to 
         harass her.  You didn't have to pay her!  It was like, a 
         miracle. 
Frasier: She's too young. 
Bulldog: [to Roz] Are you following any of this? 
Frasier: I don't expect you to understand. 
Bulldog: Great.  'Cause I don't.  So you're not going out with her? 
Frasier: No, I'm not. 
Bulldog: Good.  I'm going to see if I can catch up with her at the 
         elevator.  Maybe she's never dated a former professional 
         hockey player before. 
Frasier: You never played hockey. 
Bulldog: [bewildered] It's like we're from different planets! [exits] 
    Roz: Talk about pathetic. 
Frasier: Yes, isn't he though? 
    Roz: I meant you. 
Frasier: Me?  What, are you saying I should go out with her? 
    Roz: Frasier, take it from me.  It's hard enough to find somebody. 
         So when an opportunity like this comes along, you gotta grab 
         it. 
Frasier: Roz, what about the age thing? 
    Roz: Well, what about it? 
Frasier: Oh, come on!  You see an old man walking down the street arm 
         in arm with a beautiful young girl, what do you think? 
    Roz: I think he must be really rich.  Then I try to make eye 
         contact. 
 
 
 
 FADE TO: 
 STANLEY BARRISTER MUST 
BE REALLY, REALLY RICH 
 Scene Three: Cafe Nervosa. 
Niles joins Frasier. 
   Niles: There you are, Frasier.  I'm so glad you called me. 
Frasier: Well, thanks for coming, Niles. 
  Niles: Some of Maris's friends introduced me to the most delightful 
         party game last night.  I can't wait to share it with you. 
Frasier: Well Niles, I'd really like to talk... 
  Niles: No, no.  Shh.  This first, it's a hoot.  If you were stranded 
         on a desert island with one meal, one aria, and one bottle of 
         wine, what would they be? 
Frasier: Niles, I really don't... 
  Niles: Frasier, please. 
Frasier: Okay... A Big Mac, “I'm your Venus,” and Ripple. 
  Niles: ...If you're going to mock the game, then don't play. 
Frasier: Gladly. 
  Niles: Are you still crabbed up about this middle-aged business? 
Frasier: No.  No-no-no, I'm fine there.  By the way, you were 
         absolutely right, Niles. 
  Niles: Ooh!  I love to hear you say that. 
Frasier: Yes.  But I do have a problem.  You see, the other day I was 
         asked out by a... this twenty-two year old girl that I met in 
         a mall. 
  Niles: That is alarming. 
Frasier: Well, I turned her down. 
  Niles: No no, you were in a mall.  Did anyone see you? 
Frasier: Niles!  No, I'm just wondering if I made the right decision. 
         You see, I would, I would love to go out with this girl. 
         She's fantastic.  I’m just afraid of looking like some old 
         fool chasing after a young girl.  Becoming a walking mid-life 
         crisis cliché.  Running around like that buffoon Stanley 
         Barrister. 
 Touched off, they start talking over each other. 
   Niles: Oh, Stanley Barrister.  That is embarrassing, isn't it? 
Frasier: Oh, is that not beyond the pale?  I mean, that girl - how old 
         can she be? 
  Niles: Twenty-one, if she's a day. 
Frasier: I saw them, it was last Tuesday night, together. 
  Niles: Well, and I saw them together Wednesday morning. 
 They stop as they realize. 
    Both: Eww! 
  Niles: That's disgusting. 
Frasier: That's what's so frightening.  Well, this is what I'm afraid 
         of.  People will have the same conversation about me. 
  Niles: Stanley Barrister is a sixty-year-old man who wears a toupee 
         that looks like something he pulled out of a shower drain. 
         You are forty-one, and obviously not wearing a toupee. 
Frasier: Thank you, Niles.  So you think it would be okay to go out 
         with this woman? 
  Niles: Doesn't matter what I think. 
Frasier: Well, it does to me.  You're my brother, I value your opinion. 
  Niles: My opinion isn't relevant. 
Frasier: Don't be coy, Niles.  And will you please stop pursing your 
         lips?  It makes you look like one of those old women they 
         carve out of dried apples. 
  Niles: [purses his lips once more, then] Don't you see?  What I think 
         about you dating a younger woman is immaterial.  What we think 
         about Stanley Barrister is immaterial.  The only thing that 
         matters is what you think.  Ask yourself, if you went out with 
         her, would you be doing it because you were running away from 
         your age, or because you think this has the potential of 
         becoming a meaningful relationship? 
Frasier: I don't know. 
  Niles: Find out.  And then to hell with what people think. 
Frasier: Niles, you are absolutely right. 
  Niles: Oh!  There it is again, I never tire of hearing that.  Let the 
         tongues of the doubting nabobs wag.  If it feels right, make 
         yourself happy. 
Frasier: Thank you, thank you. [gets up] Oh, by the way Niles, if you 
         were stranded on a desert island, what would you choose as 
         your favorite meal, aria and wine? 
  Niles: The Coulibiliac of salmon at Guy Savoy, “Vissi d’Arte” from 
         Tosca, and the [Coutre Roune Château] Neuf du Pape '47. 
Frasier: You are SO predictable. 
 He walks out, leaving Niles gobsmacked. 
 FADE TO: 
 I WONDER IF THAT ALFA ROMEO 
SHOWROOM IS STILL OPEN? 
 Scene Four: The Department Store. 
Carrie is sorting some sweaters when Frasier comes in. 
 Frasier: Carrie, hi. 
 Carrie: Hi.  I didn't expect to see you here. 
Frasier: Well um, I could lie to you and tell you I came here to shop, 
         but actually I came here to see you. 
 Carrie: That's great.  I've been thinking about you a lot. 
Frasier: Well, I've been thinking a lot about you too, and I just 
         wanted to chat a little bit about why I thought we shouldn't 
         go out. 
 Carrie: Okay. 
Frasier: Well, you see, I thought I was going through a phase.  You 
         know, well, a mid-life crisis to be frank.  And ah, I was 
         afraid if I went out with you I would be trying to recapture 
         my youth or something. 
 Carrie: Oh my God.  I can't believe you're saying this.  I was afraid 
         that I asked you out only because I was trying to work out 
         some stuff of my own.  You know, some unresolved issues about 
         my father or something. 
Frasier: Oh no, no.  Because I went back and forth, you know?  I felt 
         like a fool, and then I didn't... 
 Carrie: Me, too.  Back and forth. 
Frasier: And then I thought maybe you just came along because, to fill 
         some sort of a need or something. 
 Carrie: Or, or maybe this could be something serious. 
Frasier: Exactly.  So... well.  All right, I asked myself a few tough 
         questions.. 
 Carrie: Me too. 
Frasier: And well, I finally came to a decision. 
 Carrie: Me too.  I think us going out would have been really stupid. 
Frasier: [forced enthusiasm] Me too! 
 Carrie: It would have completely clouded things with my father, and 
         you and I would never have been on a very firm footing.  But 
         you knew all that.  You could have told me, but you just let 
         me figure it out for myself. 
Frasier: Yes, I'm sort of like the Wizard of Oz. 
 Carrie: It's no wonder everybody listens to your radio show.  You're 
         so smart. 
Frasier: ...Actually, I am full of crap.  I had no idea that you 
         might have been grappling with some personal issues here. 
         Some psychiatrist, huh?  The truth is, I came down here to 
         talk you into going out with me.  I guess it's still a 
         pretty bad idea. 
 Carrie: You're being so honest with me... that is such an attractive 
         quality in a man. [she hugs him] 
Frasier: ...Well, you know, let's not go down that road again. 
 Carrie: Okay. 
Frasier: See you around.  
 Carrie turns back to her work.  As Frasier leaves, he punches 
a mannequin with great force.  She looks around at the noise, but 
he’s already gone. 
 End Of Act Two. 
 Credits:  
 Daphne is folding Martin's boring white laundry as Eddie watches.
