 We live on the one place where you are guaranteed a quiet life. 
 The safest place on earth. 
 In Fortitude, you have to be able to provide for yourself. Everyone has got a job, so there is no crime. 
 Everybody is always happy. 
 While you are here, you will need your own rifle and a hat. 
 Something groovy with ear flaps. 
 I am required to ask you if you feel safe in Fortitude? 
 Hmm mmm. 
 Are you seeing anybody? 
 (LAUGHS) Is that an official question? 
 Where did you get this? 
 I found a carcass. 
 There is an entire carcass? 
 What is it worth? 
 It is priceless. 
 Hello?! Hello?! 
 We have a very serious problem here. 
 Did you see Charlie before he died? 
 He found something precious. 
 Is this what got him killed? 
 I want you to take this to your labratory. 
 Run tests on it. 
 DCI Morton can provide invaluable analytical skills. 
 We have skills. 
 You know, nothing buried in permafrost ever decays. 
 This place is a forensic treasure house. 
 It's not that I can't forgive you... 
 It's that you are not my man anymore. 
 In this place, things can come at you from nowhere. 
 What kind of things? 
 Monsters. 
 It's happened again, Doctor Allardyce has been attacked. 
 And Shirley is missing. 
 I think there is something very bad going on in this place. 
 This bear attacked and devoured another adult male... 
 We don't see that happen, it is psychotic. 
 What are you proposing? 
 The tests I carried out, I want to do the same with Shirley Allardyce. 
 If we find what we are looking for, then that means it is not safe to live here. 
 We cannot let fear take hold. 
 I would never hurt you. 
 I would kill anybody that hurt you. 
 Are we looking at a virus here? 
 No. 
 What is causing this? 
 Prehistoric frozen wasp thaws. 
 Wasp injects eggs into human blood stream. 
 The host is compelled to find a victim. 
 Don't open the door. We can't let these things out. 
 We will have to kill them all. 
 Everyone in Fortitude could be infected. 
 I need you to tell me where the mammoth can be found. 
 Elena, don't do this. Please! 
 (KNOCKS) 
 Alexei! Alexei Podnikov! 
 Alexei? 
 (DOOR OPENS) 
 (GASPS) 
 (BABY CRIES) 
 (MAN SINGS) 
 (GUNSHOT) 
 (GUNSHOT) 
 (SCREAMS) 
 (INDISTINCT SHOUTING) 
 (ENGINE REVS) 
 (INDISTINCT SHOUTING CONTINUES) 
 Morning, Governor Odegard. 
 Hey, Bianca. 
 "The centre cannot hold. Mere anarchy is loosed upon the world." 
 Exam time. 
 English lit. Tuesday morning. 
 Good luck. 
 Thank you. 
 What are you doing? 
 Please, just calm down. I just, I want to see your bag. 
 Get off me. I just want to see in your bag. 
 No. Get off me. 
 I saw you putting carrots in your bag. 
 Okay, just let me see. 
 No, get off me. 
 You will wait! 
 You come with me! 
 I'll called the police! 
 Let her go! 
 (WHACK) 
 I'll bury this in your f*cking skull! 
 Put the axe down now, Rune! 
 That's enough of all this... 
 (WHACK) 
 (GUNSHOT) 
 Drop the axe and lie face down on the floor, or I'll shoot you! 
 I don't think I want this after all, thank you, Hong. 
 So  shoot  me! Huh! 
 Dad hears about this... you're for it, Rune! 
 (SAW CUTTING METAL) 
 Hey, finish off the rest of the hull plate, will ya? I'm beat. 
 Where's Stefan? 
 Stefan's gone, skipper. 
 Why? 
 Says he won't put to sea in a deathtrap. 
 A deathtrap. What's he talking about? 
 What's he talking a... 
 Mister Lennox? 
 Hey, Bianca. 
 I did it. Everything you need. 
 Really? 
 Lot more fun than the late poems of WB Yeats. 
 Ahahah, way to go, girl. 
 (LAUGHS) 
 Oh, Bianca... You don't know what this means... 
 You can bring my dad a big fat crab. 
 (HEAVY BREATHING) 
 (BUZZING) 
 (DEVICE BEEPS REPEATEDLY) 
 Give me the detonator. 
 There is no going back. 
 Three hundred thousand tons of snow and ice. 
 Buried forever, Vincent. Crushed and lost forever. 
 That's right. 
 Okay then. Do it. 
 (BUZZING) 
 (BEEPS) 
 (EXPLOSION) 
 (LAUGHS) 
 Hey. Vince. You're back. 
 Okay, Hildur... finally. 
 Oslo's decision is that I have to sign off on all subsidy payments. 
 Erling, you and I came to an agreement... 
 No, no, no, no, we didn't. 
 Oslo can't run Fortitude by proxy... 
 Believe me, they don't want to run Fortitude at all. 
 I've already co-signed these. You need to sign them. 
 Dear God, Hildur. Cut your losses. And get out of here. 
 There's a vacant governorship. In Trondheim. 
 They have a cheese festival. 
 Eric could be deputy. 
 Last night. Did you look out of your window, around midnight? 
 There was a glorious, singular firmament last night. 
 A blood Aurora. 
 In my time here. I've never seen it before. 
 Few people have in all their lives. 
 "Cheese festival". 
 Personally, I cannot wait to get out of here. 
 What happened to your face? 
 Oh, err... It's nothing. An accident in the supermarket. 
 This is the other thing. 
 What other thing? 
 Law and order. Dan Anderssen? 
 Eric still hasn't found a body. 
 Eric doesn't need a body. He needs a badge. 
 You need a sheriff. 
 It's high time Eric Odegard faced up to his responsibilities. 
 A full Blood Aurora occurs as a result of this mass coronal ejection striking the atmosphere... 
 "Demoniacal cacophony". Voices that never cease. Children screaming. 
 They die in the mines. In their thousands, and little babies too. 
 All in the hands of cannibals. Crunching. Little bones. Crunching. 
 On a more positive note... tonight's Blood Aurora display could be a beauty. 
 Until for one brief whisper. 
 I glimpsed peace. 
 He showed me... 
 That's the bar closed now. 
 Tonight, he's back on earth. 
 Cannibals and demons. Idiot. Man's head is full of fairytales. 
 (PANTS) 
 (KNOCKS) 
 (KNOCKS) 
 (KNOCKS) 
 (GLASS SMASHES) 
 Ingrid! What the hell are you doing...? 
 Someone's... there's been a terrible accident! 
 (SIRENS WAIL) 
 The blade threw him in the air. 
 Which side of the road? 
 The left. I think. 
 Go back and wait in the car. 
 Once I struck a reindeer and it split in half. 
 Antlers and blood in the snow. It was like a Christmas card. 
 Go back and wait in the police car. 
 Has Lars been drinking? 
 Everybody's been drinking. 
 There. 
 Help me here. 
 Who is it? 
 (SCREAMS) 
 Oh, my, Petra... 
 Let's turn him around. 
 His head is gone. 
 Freya! Where are you! 
 I'm coming! 
 Michael? 
 In here. 
 Come here. Help me work this thing. 
 Can you... open that, I need to print it out. 
 What am I looking at? 
 This is what they know at FARC. 
 Red King crab... marching across the Arctic sea floor. 
 Heading our way. At thirteen dollars a pound. 
 The highest pier-head price I've ever seen. 
 Somebody... stole this stuff? 
 Technically... 
 Is this illegal, Michael, because I can't have any police attention... 
 It's all okay. Don't you worry about it. 
 Don't worry about a thing. 
 Cause I'm going to catch... the Red King Crab.... 
 Michael... 
 Baddest bastards in the sea. 
 Oh cut it out, you lunatic. 
 Not one of them as bad as me... 
 Oh, put me down before you hurt your stupid back. 
 Okay. So the snow plough hit him. 
 The snow plough hit him. 
 And the blade of the snow plough sliced off the head. 
 You think? 
 Petra? 
 What!? 
 This is more like a clean cut. 
 With a bladed implement. 
 You do not have the training or the experience to make that kind of judgment. 
 That cut was made with a very sharp blade... 
 Ingrid, don't presume to lecture me about... 
 Not the snow bucket of a big old f*cking lorry! 
 Lars has confessed! 
 Yeah, but the reason we can't find the head in the snow... 
 No! 
 Is because it has been taken away... 
 No. 
 By whoever murdered him! 
 No, no, no... 
 No. No. No. Please. No. 
 I can't... I can't do this... 
 Somebody... killed him, I knew that. Moment I saw his body. 
 The only person I ever touch. 
 Is already dead. Only intimacy, I ever have in my life... is if they're already... 
 
 
 
 (DOOR OPENS) 
 Is it Dan? 
 No, I don't think so... 
 So...? Ah, Petra has made a... a... preliminary evaluation, Governor. 
 Governor? 
 It is clear to me that the victim was assaulted, murdered and decapitated. 
 The nature of the injury isn't consistent in any way with a snow plough impact. 
 Somebody cut off his head with a sharp bladed implement. 
 So that traffic accident is now a crime scene. A murder scene. 
 Who is he? 
 There is no I.D. 
 None of us recognise him. 
 I don't recognise him either. 
 So... you have to get back up there now. 
 Secure the scene. Fingertip search. 
 Photographs. 
 Petra, you'll be the senior investigating officer. 
 What about Eric? 
 Unfortunately, Eric is not here. He is still looking for Dan's body. 
 Okay. 
 Like some kind of puppy, that you tolerated or... or... found amusing... or cute or... loyal or obedient or... 
 You're not cute. 
 You never said anything to make me think anything other than all that. 
 I don't. 
 Don't what? 
 Say stuff like that. 
 I know you don't. 
 To anyone. I never have. 
 Said what? 
 That I... I just don't find it easy... 
 So say it then. 
 Because how the f*ck is any poor fucker ever supposed to know how you feel about them. 
 If you feel about them. 
 They could trust their instincts. 
 My instincts! My instincts told me that you wanted Jason. 
 You wanted a big alpha s*x bloke. 
 A s*x bloke? 
 Yeah! A strong man. Not a f*cking puppy. 
 Jason killed himself. 
 Yeah, I know. 
 You nearly died too. 
 I know that. 
 But you didn't. 
 Not any more, cos I, I need to go, I need to leave this place. 
 I don't think I'm ever going to get better. 
 I need to find my passport and then pack. 
 Will you, err... Come and see me in London. 
 (CROWS CAW) 
 Come on. 
 Blood! 
 (INDISTINCT CHATTER) 
 Thank you, Tomak. 
 You drinking alone? 
 Not if you join me. 
 Haven't got long. 
 sh1t. 
 sh1t. It's the Aurora. 
 The Bloody Aurora. 
 (WIND BLOWS) 
 (INDISTINCT CHATTER BEINGS AGAIN) 
 (DOGS BARK, HOWL) 
 (DOG WHIMPERS) 
 (PHONE RINGS) 
 Yeah? 
 Michael, we are trying to get the boats fuelled up, but there's a problem? 
 What is it? 
 Axel Fersen's being an arsehole. 
 Says he can't release the diesel... 
 Hey, Lamont, I'm, I'm gonna have to call you back... 
 Freya. Freya! Freya! Freya! Freya! What, what happened? 
 Come here, baby, let's get you in the house. Come on. 
 Come on. Oh, Freya, what happened, my sweet baby? 
 What happened? 
 Freya. Baby. Come on, baby, come on. 
 Come on. 
 I'm okay. Michael. I'm okay... 
 Dear Christ. If I hadn't seen that light on the ground. 
 If I hadn't seen the light outside my car window. 
 It's okay. Baby. 
 How long were... you... how long were you...? 
 I don't know. 
 What happened? 
 My legs went, I think. 
 I'm calling the doctor. 
 No. 
 Yes, Freya, Frey, this is too soon. It's too soon. 
 This shouldn't be... They said it would be six months... six months to a year... before... This shouldn't be. 
 No. You can't. You know you can't. 
 I'm not leaving my home and that's what the doctor will do. 
 Exile. I can't stay on the Island if they know I'm this sick. 
 No. No. Michael. Just cuddle me. Make me warm. 
 You can't call him. 
 Dan Anderssen was a strange man. I think he was loved. 
 But I think he was very lonely. 
 Like a proper sheriff, from the wildwest. 
 Vincent has wasps in his head. 
 Well. They nearly killed him. 
 Is Eric the sheriff now? 
 Do you think Eric would make a good sheriff? 
 'A good sheriff or a baaad sheriff'. 
 Dan's dead. I know that. I've known that for a while. 
 You don't disappear in the arctic and then show up weeks later with stubble and a story. 
 I grieve him. I'm sad. But he's dead. 
 Eric is absent because he's chosen to be apart from me. 
 The road's closed. Glacier road. I saw a police car and tape. 
 What happened? 
 Nothing we have to worry about this time, thank God. 
 (SCREAMS) 
 (DOGS BARK, HOWL, WHIMPER) 
 (KNOCKS) 
 Michael. 
 I need to talk to you. 
 For some reason, the harbourmaster won't give us any fuel. 
 Not just me... the whole fleet. 
 There's a new arrangement. Everything that Oslo subsidises has to be... re-approved by an official from Oslo who... I'm under instructions. 
 Hildur. I need this. I have to go to sea. 
 I have to hit the crab this time. 
 More than anything.... I've never asked you for a favour, Hildy... 
 I... I wouldn't... 
 Michael, I can't do this. 
 (PHONE RINGS) 
 I need to get out there... 
 Skippy, it's really kicking off down here... 
 (INDISTINCT CHATTER) 
 I'll be right there. 
 (INDISTINCT SHOUTING) 
 The f*cking keys now. 
 I haven't got the keys. 
 This is your last f*cking chance, give me the keys. 
 (HONKS) 
 For Christ's sake, put it down! 
 I'm your governor. Am I not? 
 I understand you need fuel. 
 Mister Fersen does not have the authority to release the fuel. 
 I do. 
 Help Mr. Fersen to his feet and we'll get the boats all fuelled. 
 The boats are fueled, but nobody wants to go to sea in The Muriel. 
 Lamont's going. 
 Lamont's soft in the head. 
 Not on 60, Rune, you'll shrink everything... 
 What is this? 
 I don't know. 
 Is it blood? 
 I don't know what it is it, could be anything. 
 Sixty degrees it is then. 
 Mum. Rune. Morning. 
 She told me what happened. 
 Oh. - What happened? 
 He punched Hildur Odegard. 
 I didn't... punch... 
 He did what? 
 Hit the governor. 
 Accidently. Not, not deliberately... 
 He... punched... 
 It's okay... 
 What happened... You alright? 
 Yeah. My wrist turned... that's all. 
 I'm fine. I'm fine. 
 Take me with you. 
 What? 
 Dad. You're short handed. This is too important. 
 You won't get anyone else. I'm coming with you. 
 I'll find some gear. 
 He's right. 
 He's not right. He's sixteen. 
 Why was she stealing carrots, Rune? 
 What? 
 Why was that girl stealing all those carrots? 
 Because. You want to stay safe in this place. 
 You have to be able to see in the dark. 
 (LAUGHS) 
 Enjoy the sea, kiddo. 
 We found it near the body. It's been bent out of shape. 
 And no identification on the victim? 
 We have no idea who the dead man is. 
 No. None. 
 No one has reported anyone missing. 
 So he could be a newcomer, a visitor? 
 Yeah, or someone without any friends. 
 (KNOCKS) 
 I just popped in on my way to the airport. 
 Sorry, Vincent. Gotta go. 
 Sorry. Catch up when you get back... 
 I just came to say goodbye. I'm heading home for good. 
 For good? 
 Health... Health issues. Ever since... 
 Oh. Well. Vincent, I'm sorry my husband isn't here. 
 I'm sure Eric would like to say goodbye properly. 
 He did. 
 What? 
 He said goodbye yesterday. On the glacier. 
 You saw him? 
 Hildy... 
 Dan Anderssen is dead and gone. That's that, Eric. 
 So you are needed in Fortitude. Because there's been a murder. 
 A murder? 
 Yes! A bloody... decapitation! 
 Who...? Who's been murdered? 
 We don't know. 
 Hildy... 
 I'm just... We're just clinging on. 
 Hey. 
 We can't all run away like this! Chasing dead men. 
 Avoiding everything. 
 Dan is in the past. All the bad... sh1t that happened. 
 You and me... 
 What... you and me? 
 A man is dead and you are needed. 
 (SIGHS) 
 I fed them last night and everything was fine. 
 They were running rampage through the town. 
 A research student was savaged. 
 I really think you've got the wrong dogs. 
 No. No, we haven't. 
 The gate is open. 
 Oh, my God, they are all gone. Like all the dogs... 
 (SCREAMS) 
 Its spine has.... the... the spine has been removed. 
 You eat when I say, you sleep when I say. You do everything I tell you, you do everything Lamont tells you... because you f*ck up out there at sea, and it's all over but the shouting. 
 How much do I get paid? 
 Ah, you'll be paid a greenhorn's share. 
 How much is that? 
 Half a percent of the catch profit. 
 Okay. A half percent of f*ck all is still f*ck all. 
 (ALARM RINGS) 
 Michael. Michael Lennox! Your boat! 
 sh1t! sh1t! 
 What happened? 
 I just... - Give me that. 
 (FLAMES BLAZING) 
 (SPRAYS FIRE EXTINGUISHER) 
 (COUGHS) 
 What the f*ck happened, Lamont? 
 I don't know, skipper. I was down below... and smelled the smoke. 
 Dad. I'm going with Tannar. 
 What the hell are you doing? 
 Greenhorn's share. Half a per cent of Tannar's catch... 
 She needs this. 
 (FOOTSTEPS) 
 Goodnight, Natalie. 
 (DOOR OPENS) 
 If you're too repressed to say it, I'm not. 
 I don't want to live without you. 
 Are you planning to keep the beard? 
 You don't like the beard? 
 I don't like the rash. 
 I don't have a rash. 
 I do. 
 Did you miss me then? 
 (LAUGHS) 
 What...? 
 Dan Anderssen used to say, if someone said "Will you miss me?", Dan used to say... "I'll only miss you if you zig-zag." 
 (LAUGHS) 
 Watch out! 
 Hey, you! Hey. Stop! 
 Hey, you. Hey! 
 Dan? Dan? 
 (SCREAMS, MOANS) 
 (SCREAMS) 
 (WHACK, WHACK) 
 (MOANS) 
 _ 
 Bad things come at night. 
 You'd loaded the gun yourself. 
 (BUZZING) 
 (PANTING) 
 (SCREAMS) 
 (GUNSHOT)
