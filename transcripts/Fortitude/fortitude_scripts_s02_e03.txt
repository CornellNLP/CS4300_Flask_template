 I am no longer governor. 
 I will be in charge... 
 What we learn from her may yet save lives. 
 (CHOKING) 
 (BEAR ROARING) 
 (KID SCREAMING) 
 Bears don't come into town here unless they're starving. 
 The victim was murdered and decapitated. 
 Is Rune involved in what happened? 
 I'm trying. 
 I know you're trying.

 Okay. 
 I'm talking to you as your sister. 
 As opposed to what? 
 Laszlo Hindemith was found dead. The place was full of drugs. 
 Your belt was in his bed. 
 I lost that belt. Weeks ago. 
 Where? 
 If I knew that, Ingrid, I wouldn't have lost it. 
 Where were you when Hindemith was killed? 
 (EXHALES) 
 (SIGHS) 
 Rune Lennox, you're under arrest for suspicion of murder. 
 What? 
 And f*ck your rights. 
 (ENGINE REVS BESIDE THEM) 
 Woah... 
 sh1t. 
 This is Eric... Tavrani Tavra is now a murder suspect, repeat... 
 Tavra is a murder suspect... 
 That was him. 
 Apprehend and arrest. Repeat. Apprehend and arrest. 
 (SIRENS WAIL) 
 Eric, I just saw him, he went right in front of me, he's heading East out of town. 
 (ENGINE REVS) 
 (SIRENS WAIL) 
 There he is! 
 Go right at the fork. 
 (PHONE RINGS) 
 (PHONE STOPS RINGING) 
 Good morning, Hildur. 
 I assume that's not government property? 
 The mouse mat? 
 Yes. The mouse mat. 
 This is your notice of termination. 
 It includes a legally binding confidentiality clause. 
 Three copies, each of the three requires a signature. 
 I have also prepared a press release. 
 "Looking forward to new challenges in local government". 
 Let's not make it any harder than it has to be. 
 (PHONE RINGS) 
 Erling Munk. 
 (INDISTINCT CHATTER) 
 Dmitri Podnikov? 
 He's the Mayor of Vukobejina. 
 (CLEARS THROAT) 
 If it's an official call, you must hand it back to me. 
 (SPEAKS IN RUSSIAN) _ 
 I speak excellent Russian. 
 I know. 
 (BUZZING) 
 (HEAVY BREATHING) 
 I thought it was a wasp. 
 Are you okay? 
 Yeah. 
 Really? 
 Yeah, yeah. I'm fi... I'm fine. 
 Okay then, let's go. 
 You want milk? 
 What? 
 With your Americano. 
 You don't put milk in an Americano. 
 It's the only one you don't but milk in. 
 That's why they call it an Americano. Not a Latte, for example. 
 Or a Cappuccino. 
 You're the guy that killed the bear. 
 So? 
 Coffee expert too! 
 You're welcome. 
 An Americano with milk. 
 I need you to take me round the coast of Vukobejina. 
 The Mayor just called me, for a meeting. 
 You've got a chopper, get you there in half hour. 
 What the f*ck do you need a boat for? 
 I like the sea air. 
 Hildy, you hate the sea air. 
 (SCOFFS) 
 So obviously you have some good reason to lie to my face. 
 I'll pay you, of course. 
 No, thank you, Governor.I  don't need your charity. 
 I'm not the Governor any more. They fired me. 
 They didn't. 
 They f*cking did. 
 Oh, Hildy, I'm sorry. 
 (PHONE BUZZES) 
 Thank you. Yes. 
 I got Hindemith's killer... it's Tavrani Tavra. 
 The taxidermist? 
 What... they can't kill people? 
 No, I was just, surprised. 
 We're looking into motive, but it's, it's definitely him. 
 Okay. 
 You don't seem very interested. 
 No. No. That's, err, that's good. Of course. 
 Thanks for letting me know. 
 Are you okay? 
 Sure. Listen. I have to go. 
 Well? 
 I'll take your charity. 
 Brain scan's clear. 
 Pity. 
 Ingrid? Need you to get over to Tavra's. 
 Lock it down and start a search before it gets dark. 
 Okay. 
 Don't worry. I'll do everything. 
 Doctor... where the hell's Dan Anderssen? 
 I don't know. 
 You told us he was sort of... dead. 
 He is arisen. 
 I'm Dr. Khatri. 
 I'm Dan. 
 Is that supposed to mean something to me? 
 I want to see Elena. 
 So I was told. Are you a relative? 
 No. I tried to kill her. But I missed. 
 Call the hospital. 
 She's everything to me. The love of my life. 
 You're the Sheriff? 
 Err, I'm sorry. I heard you were... very unwell. 
 I want to see Elena. 
 (MACHINE BEEPING) 
 (DOOR BEEPS, WHIRS) 
 I'm afraid her coma is the severest type, a metabolic encephalopathy. 
 (MACHINE BEEPS) 
 But she's in no pain. 
 Is it because I shot her? 
 Not at all. 
 She was attacked by wasps from the mammoth and infected with a tiny parasitic organism... a toxoplasma. 
 We've seen nothing like it. 
 It's been in deep freeze in the permafrost for thousands of years. 
 Her immune system is fighting it. 
 We're helping her fight it in every way we can. 
 Can she hear me? 
 I'm afraid not. 
 She doesn't know I'm here? 
 She's asleep, Mr. Anderssen. She knows nothing. 
 Will she wake up? 
 The machines are keeping her alive. 
 Why the security? 
 It's just a precaution. 
 She's the only survivor we have. 
 We still don't know what we're dealing with. 
 Please feel free to visit any time you like. 
 Did they say why? They fired you? 
 Ignoring the fuel quota. 
 That was the official excuse. 
 Was there an unofficial one? 
 In politics, always. 
 You did the right thing. 
 There it is. The Arctic Riviera. 
 (LOUD NOISE IN BACKGROUND) 
 Eric? Petra? Who's there? 
 (BREATHING RAPIDLY) 
 (GASPS) 
 Dan. Are you alright? 
 I'm a bit dizzy. 
 What are you doing here? 
 I went to see Elena. She doesn't want to be there. 
 What? 
 She's not happy. 
 Dr. Khatri's taking good care of her. 
 I didn't like Dr. Khatri. 
 You need to go back to hospital. 
 I didn't like her at all. 
 (CHAIR SQUEAKS) 
 I'm getting you back to hospital now. 
 No, you're not, Eric. I'm fine. Really. 
 Okay. If you're not going back to hospital, you're staying with us. 
 Your call. 
 How was it? 
 Cold. Wet. Here... 
 Thank you, Rune. 
 Ingrid just called. 
 Oh, mum. She's being ridiculous. 
 It's nothing. Don't worry about it. Please. 
 Okay, baby. 
 (DOOR LOCKING) 
 Hey! Hey! Hey! Mum. Mum. Open the door! 
 Mum! MUM! MUM! 
 Where's the head? 
 What? 
 My head. Where is it? 
 It's not really your head, is it? 
 I mean, technically it used to belong to someone else. 
 I'll ask the questions. 
 First you tell me where it is. 
 It's here. In a fridge. 
 It's evidence. 
 Okay. I killed Hindemith. 
 We know you killed him. You had his head in your fridge. 
 We want to know why you did it. 
 I killed him... I killed him because he was crazy. 
 His soul was in torment. He was, erm... I... 
 Anyway, I released him. He was happy. 
 It was all good. 
 Happy? 
 Yeah. 
 So you took his head. As a souvenir? 
 He didn't need it. 
 Who's been living with you? 
 No one. 
 There was a holdall on a bed. With clothes in. 
 And a hunting knife. 
 You should never have come. You should have stayed away. 
 Someone took it. Just now. 
 You don't know what this is, you don't know what you're doing. 
 WHO TOOK IT? (GRUNTS) 
 The demon is among us. We're going to die. All of us. 
 Nothing else can save us. 
 Slow down, Natalie. What's that there? 
 (GUNSHOT) 
 The deer was eating it. 
 That's not possible. They're herbivores. 
 Bears prey on reindeer. Not the other way round. 
 Did it kill it? 
 That's not possible either. 
 f*ck! f*ck! f*ck! f*ck! 
 f*ck! 
 It's out here, you know it is, it's f*cking everywhere. 
 They're f*cked. We're f*cked. Everything's f*cked. 
 Vince. 
 It's okay. Everything's gonna be okay. 
 I'll go get the tents, you saw up the corpses for samples. Okay? 
 f*ck! 
 
 
 
 (DOOR BEEPS) 
 I'll be dead by the morning. 
 (CELL DOOR BEEPS) 
 I found his belt in Hindemith's place. 
 I wanted to deal with it. I'm sorry. 
 I wasn't sure it was important. 
 Important? 
 Someone took a holdall from Tavra's... it could have been him! 
 He won't talk to me. 
 Fine. He can talk to me. 
 What's your meeting about? 
 Ah. He didn't say, exactly. 
 Does he know you're not governor any more? 
 I haven't told anyone yet. 
 He didn't want to talk on the phone. He sounded... 
 Where is everyone? 
 He sounded what? 
 Scared. 
 I'm not gonna make it home by nightfall. 
 I'm gonna find us a place to stay. 
 Okay. Good. 
 Hildur. 
 Dmitri. 
 Hildur, this is Major Potemkin of the Federal Security Service. 
 He just arrived today. 
 Unfortunately Governor Odegard speaks no Russian... but luckily Major Potemkin has a little English so he can follow our conversation. 
 Oh, good. Very good. 
 So, what brings you to Vukobejina, Governor? 
 I just, err, wanted to say goodbye in person, Dmitri. 
 I'm leaving Fortitude. 
 I'm sorry to hear that. 
 We have always been able to meet and share our problems. 
 I'm looking forward to new challenges in local government. 
 I see. I only hope I'll share the same excellent working relationship with your successor. 
 I can't tell you how much I respect him. 
 I know you leave Fortitude a much better place than you found it. 
 Well, sadly, not everybody would agree with that. 
 But things here are great. 
 Yes. 
 It's, erm, certainly nice and quiet. 
 On the surface maybe, but underneath Vukobejina is a very happening place. 
 With such a fascinating history. 
 You remember my interest in local history? 
 Of course. 
 I'd love to tell you about it some time. 
 Yes, I'm, err, staying at the hotel tonight, so.... 
 Well, thank you for making time for me, Dmitri. 
 God be with us all. 
 Yes. 
 (KEYS CLANK ON THE TABLE) 
 (GULPS) 
 (MACHINE BEEPS) 
 (WIND GUSHES) 
 (BLOWING) 
 I'm sorry about before. 
 I, I overreacted and it was, undignified and unscientific. 
 Yeah. 
 When I was a kid, I wanted to be a magician. 
 What? 
 Just saying. Y'know. Bit of background. 
 (LAUGHS) 
 Right. Do you want to do it? 
 Huh? 
 With me. Now. It. 
 It's not a new advance in epigenetics, Vincent... 
 It's a simple Yes or No answer. 
 Yeah. 
 Fully clothed in one sleeping bag? Can't be done. 
 We're scientists, Vincent. 
 We explore the furthest boundaries of the possible. It's what we do. 
 Well... when you put it like that. 
 (SPEAKS IN RUSSIAN) _ 
 (FIRE EXPLODES FROM HOSE) 
 (SPEAKS IN RUSSIAN) _ 
 (FIRE BLAZES, CRACKLES) 
 Eric. Thanks for coming in. Please. 
 Great news about the murder. 
 There are still some loose ends. 
 Ah, and I'm sure you'll tie them up. 
 Eric, you've been acting Sheriff for a while now, with great distinction... it's time to make it permanent. 
 What about Dan? He seems much better. 
 It's, it's amazing. 
 Sick leave. Forever. Congratulations, Sheriff Odegard! 
 But, the governor of Fortitude appoints the Sheriff. 
 What's your point? 
 Not Oslo. 
 I'm sorry, I thought you, I assumed you knew. 
 Your wife was relieved of her duties yesterday. 
 I am now acting governor of Fortitude. 
 Eric. Eric, I need you to focus now. 
 The town has been through terrible things. 
 It needs to get back to normal. 
 (PHONE RINGS) 
 Ingrid? Yes, what? 
 (INDISTINCT CHATTER) 
 What? 
 What? Call Petra in. I'll meet you there. 
 What? 
 (ENGINE STARTS UP) 
 (ENGINE REVS) 
 (SIRENS WAIL) 
 (softly) It's coming. 
 Jesus, Hildy. 
 That icy nordic gloom. 
 Come on, let's face it. 
 My sh1t is way worse than yours is! 
 How is that? 
 I bet you got a big fat payoff. 
 You can sell your boat! 
 Buff up your resume. 
 I'm middle-aged! 
 It's a bureaucrat's best years. 
 I'm unemployable! 
 So what? Who cares? So you retire and live off Eric. 
 With Eric. Is what I meant. 
 (SIGHS) 
 No, I don't think I can. 
 Hmm? 
 I don't think I love Eric anymore. 
 Oh, you are so f*cking competitive. 
 What? 
 It doesn't matter how bad my sh1t is, yours is always gotta be worse. Doesn't it? 
 Bullshit! 
 You were always like that. 
 No, I wasn't! 
 Unbelievable. 
 (LAUGHS) 
 Look, for what it's worth, I'm sorry. 
 Yeah. 
 Have you told him? 
 You should probably mention it. At some point. 
 Trust me, for that conversation, there is no 'good time'. 
 As I'm sure that we both remember. 
 You broke my heart. 
 You broke mine first. 
 You broke mine worse. 
 Unbelievable. 
 (SIGHS) 
 Ugh! Damn, this vodka's good.I  want to get out of here. 
 You're right. Let's get a bottle. 
 Yeah. 
 (to barman) Get a bottle. 
 (PHONE VIBRATES) 
 (PHONE RINGS) 
 Mr. Anderssen. Do you know what time it is? 
 No. I came to see Elena. 
 Well, I'm afraid it's not convenient. 
 Why's that? Is she busy? 
 It's not possible now, Mr. Anderssen. 
 Why? 
 I'm her doctor. 
 You said feel free to visit anytime you like. 
 I don't have to explain myself. 
 Those were your words. 
 I'm going to have to ask you to leave. 
 I just want to say "good night". 
 (DIALING) 
 (LINE TRILLING) 
 It's me. We may have a problem here. 
 Something unexpected. 
 (SIRENS WAIL) 
 It's a girl. Lief Ericson saw her when he was driving home. 
 Where's her head? 
 It's gone. 
 I can see that. 
 Then why did you ask? 
 We think it's been taken. Like the other one. 
 Hindemith. 
 I know his name. Jesus, Jesus Christ! 
 I have to report to Munk. 
 Why is anyone reporting to Munk? 
 At least we know Tavra didn't do this one. 
 (SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYS) 
 (GASPS) 
 (ELECTRICITY WHIRRING) 
 Hey! 
 Ingrid? 
 I'm sorry. 
 (SCREAMS) 
 INGRID... INGRID... 
 (SCREAMS CONTINUE) 
 INGRIIIIIIID! 
 INGRIIIIIIID! 
 Did you see that guy in the bar? 
 Hmm. 
 I think he was watching us. 
 (LAUGHS) 
 Err, it's just probably routine. 
 I bet you anything they watch all the unemployed governors and bankrupt trawlermen that pass through. 
 You were always good at that. 
 What? 
 Making me laugh. 
 Yeah. Just not anything else. 
 (THEY LAUGH) 
 What will you do when you sell the boat? 
 Freya's sick. She's real sick. 
 There's no cure. 
 What? 
 Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis. 
 You just get weaker and then one day you just can't breathe. 
 Oh, no, Michael... 
 Everybody dies, Hildur. 
 You... you know, you just hope it's not too soon. 
 You know, you hope it doesn't hurt too much. Nobody gets out alive. 
 Tough on Rune and Ingrid though. 
 Yeah. Tough on them. 
 (SIGHS) 
 Okay, your sh1t is worse than mine. 
 (LAUGHS) 
 Yes. That's something. 
 (GLASSES CLINK) 
 (BUILDING ALARM BEGINS TO RING) 
 Go round the back! 
 INGRID! INGRID! 
 (MOANS, GROANS) 
 Rune! 
 Tavrani's tongue was cut out. 
 What? The head's gone. It's been taken. 
 How did they get in? 
 How did they get out? 
 I'll call the ambulance. 
 He spoke to Tavra. 
 I've heard the voice before. I think. 
 Where? 
 (CRASH) 
 (MUSIC PLAYS IN THE BACKGROUND) 
 (CHAIN RATTLING) 
 (REINDEER GRUNTING) 
 These are carrots. 
 Blood. 
 This is where she was killed, isn't it? 
 (RUSTLING AT THE DOOR) 
 Who was? 
 (Haukur Morthens' "Þér ég ann" continues playing) 
 (GASPS) 
 (HEAVY BREATHING) 
 (COUGHS) 
 Vince. Vince, Vince... 
 What are you looking for? 
 Turn the light on. Please put the light on. 
 It's okay. I'm here. 
 You're here, there's nothing else... 
 Please put the light on. 
 What? 
 f*cking torch is dead. 
 I put new batteries in this morning. 
 Vince. 
 I'm, I'm, I'm sorry I... I woke you. 
 I'm s... 
 I'm okay. I'm... I'm fine. 
 Just... go back to sleep. 
 Natalie. 
 It's okay. 
 Come here. Come here. It's okay. 
 It's just a nightmare. I'll be fine. 
 (WHISPERING INDISTINCTLY) 
 Everything's gonna be okay. 
 Yeah. 
 There's clear evidence of complex tissue regeneration. 
 WERE YOU ALONE? 
 I can't go on like this. 
 Still nothing... in either eye? 
 Still, you come here, into this shitty little office. 
 Enough! 
 (GUNSHOT) 
 We're dealing with a f*cking psychopath. 
 (CRASH)
