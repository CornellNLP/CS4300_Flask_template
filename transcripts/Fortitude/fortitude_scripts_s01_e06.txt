 Frank : Didn't know him, never met him, didn't kill him. 
 Morton : Can you tell me how your t-shirt got covered in blood? 
 Frank : My little boy was sick. 
 Dan : Something terrible happened to him. 
 Jules : It's frostbite. 
 Dan : ... In the little boy's bedroom. 
 Covered in blood. 
 Morton : I found it in Stoddart's study. 
 But the scan has Pettigrew's name on it. 
 When I asked you if he had stayed at the hotel, you blushed like you are doing right now. 
 You know him though. 
 Pettigrew is the reason he is here. 
 Odegard : The little boy was there when Charlie Stoddart was murdered? 
 He was right there. 
 (Intro music) 
 Henry : Miss! 
 Be careful. 
 Frostbite can cause serious damage to your ears. 
 Frostbite really could. 
 Take hold of this. 
 You have this and put it on. I only live up there. 
 And you can put it through my letterbox tomorrow. 
 Jules : I'm okay. 
 (Snorts) 
 Stoddart : Lao... 
 Come on Lao! 
 Come on! 
 Eat! 
 (Dog growls) Hey. Hey. Hey. Eat! 
 (Dog whines) Quiet. (Dog whines and barks) Quiet! Lao stay there. What's your name? (Dog barks) Sit there. Here we go. Is that better? What's all this? Have you not been well? You're absolutely freezing. Will you tell me your name? What were you doing out there in the cold? Your feet. (Rubs feet) Dear me. Your feet are stone cold. (Crash) (Growl) Liam : Doggy. Markus : Mister Sutter? Frank : Hi. Mister... Husekleppe. Yeah. Yeah. We've met. Parents evening. You were there in spirit if not in person. I'm Liam's teacher. I know who you are. He is a very bright boy. Yes. Yeah. Talkative. Friendly. Helpful. Yes. Takes after his mother I guess. Probably. Uhuh. I need to get on home. I hear he has the mumps. That's right. Yeah. I need to... Hey! Ohh... Okay, you are bleeding, where are you bleeding from? Liam, tell me what happened. Liam, are you hurt? Liam what happened to you? Liam, are you hurt? Son, tell me what happened? Are you hurt? I don't understand. Where is the bleeding? I can't find anything, I can't. I don't understand. Liam : I threw up. It's okay, son. Liam : Where's mum? She's erm... She'll be home in a minute. Door open, dad. Morton : Petra, could you hold this for me? Right up there, just like that? Okay, so the potato peeler is used first. And that is these superficial wounds here. That is why there is no great amount of blood. And the stabbing arc is quite short. Then he picks up a knife and he slashes closer, downwards. Like this. Dan : Then finally the cleaver. And that's what causes the blood to spray. Right. Which is consistent with the assailant sitting astride the man hacking downwards and... What? Petra : I don't know. I can see something strange I think. There's something inside him. Something tiny. Dan : What do you see? A foreign object. A fragment. Stuck to the lower left rib, the underside of the rib. I can't see it. Would you pull it out please? At first I thought it was a bone fragment but. It's a fingernail. From a child? Doc Allardyce : Hyperbaric oxygen treatment can help damaged cells recover. Any tissue in Liam's feet that can be saved will be as long as he's in there. Odegard : And what happens if we wake him up? Just long enough to speak to him? Doc Allardyce : When he becomes fully conscious, the pain will be unbearable. Well then, that is not an option. Morton : We can leave the child alone and learn nothing or we can wake him up and get some answers. I think we have to wake him up. Odegard : Yes. But not before I talk to his mother. Jules : No. No. No. You listen to me. Somebody must have put it there. That is not him. I'm sorry, Jules. No! Don't touch me. No! Get off me! Somebody has done this to him. Dan : Jules. Look at me. Liam's going to be okay. I won't let any harm come to your son. You promised me that before. Dan : We have to wake him. No! f*ck you! Leave him alone! f*ck you. Leave him alone. You leave him alone Dan! (Sobs) Jules : Hey, sweetie. It's mummy. Mummy's here. Are you awake? Liam? Rapid low-voltage EEG. He's beginning to wake now. I'm going to up his painkiller by five mill. Liam? Can you hear me? Mum? Hey. It's okay sweetheart. You're safe and the doctor's looking after you. I want you to talk to somebody, okay? Answer the questions. Liam? How are you feeling? I am going to ask you some questions. Do you think you can follow me? Liam? I think he's drifting. Doc Allerdyce : Give it a moment. Be quick. Please. Morton : I will. Liam, were you with someone that night? No. No? How did you get across town? Walk. Alone? Please. Okay. Yes. Liam, can you remember what happened in the kitchen? Liam : Onions. And do you remember... Doggie. Doggie... Liam : Feet hurt. Thwackkk! All wet! Thwackk!!! Stop this. My feet! Mum! My feet! My feet are burning! Jules : You have to stop this now. My hands! Wait! Thwackk! Morton : Liam. Liam. What happened? My hands! My hands! I put my hands inside the man! Let me out! Let me out! Margaret. Enough. Alright, put him back! Jules : What is happening? Do something. My feet are burning... Jules : What is happening? Let me out. Let me out! Please! For God's sake get him out of there! My feet are burning!!! Let me out! Let me out! Doc Allardyce : He is stable. It's alright, sweetie. I am here. I am here. I am here. Odegard : How can she ever cope with this? Dan : She can't. Charlie must have. He must've brought him in from the cold. And then... Poor Charlie. Carrie : Dad? Ronnie : What. Carrie : I'm very tired. Ronnie : I know, Pet. Here... Come here. Give me a hand. I can't get my big fat fingers in here, look. See these. See these two wires. Uhuh. The black and the red one. Yip. I want you to touch them together for me. Why? Cos it'll make the engine start. Can't you do it? No. I can't, Pet. Because you've hurt your hand? No. I haven't. You have. I know you have. Carrie. Will you do what I tell you and touch these two wires together please. No. Carrie! No! You'll do as you're f*cking told! Do as you are f*cking told and touch the wires together and we will get out of here. Please. No! Dad! No! I don't want to anymore. I want to go home! I want to go back to school. I want to see Liam. I'm only ten, dad. I'm only ten. I want my mum. Oh my baby. Come here. Oh, my baby. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. Oh Carrie, I am so sorry. Everything I've done. I'm so sorry. You are my baby, I love you. (Sobs) (Sobs) (Engine starts) 
 
 Trish : Your leg still hurts? Eric : Yes. A little bit. Listen Trish. We have the murderer for sure. Sutter. The search and rescue guy. No. Not him. His son. His son? Yes. His little boy. He did it. Little boy? Yes. He's ten years old. He did it. Trish : A ten year old child? Yes. A child killed Charlie? Yes, Trish. That's what you're telling me now? Shirley : How can his mum and dad cope with a thing like that? Markus : I don't know. Shirley : I mean, how does a little boy have the... Sorry, Markus. (Blows nose) Have does he even have the strength? From experience. I'll tell you. Children can be surprisingly strong. A ten year old boy having a tantrum. Tantrum? Well. Struggling, y'know. Hello Henry. Henry : Morning Shirley. Madness has its own strength. There's an offer on the blue swan vodka this week. I don't want it. Sorry. Markus : So, this child. Ten years old. A boy I know well. What about him? It transpires is the killer. I don't know. You run out of words. Out of thoughts. What child? I know. Beyond human understanding. But that's what happened. Liam Sutter. Ten years old. Hacked a grown man to death. I try to teach them that life is a precious thing. A gift. Hey! Hey! Hey! What are you saying about Liam Sutter? What's he saying? Dan : Frank. I understand that you were telling me the truth about where the blood came from. We found corroborating evidence. Liam lost a fingernail and it was inside Stoddart's body. Liam told us what he did. He told us all in front of his mother. Frank : Stop it. Dan : I'm more sorry than I know how to. Then stop it. Just stop talking. You know. You know this is all sh1t. Open this. Henry : Julia. I heard about your son. I'm so sorry. Is there anything is can do to help. Here, take this. Can I help you? A drink. What? Have you got a drink? A drink. Here. I've lost him. (Groan) Jules. Jules! (Sobs) LittleJohn : Questions of motive don't even enter into it, do they? Morton : No. No. This is a profound psychosis. He takes the chopping block and smashes it down on Stoddart's head. Then hacking and stabbing and... relentless. I mean... inhuman savagery. From a ten years old kid. Where does that come from? Where? This is not something we're qualified to answer, Gene. I guess not. Okay. Pettigrew. Yes. Pettigrew. They took the GPR scan but they left the folder. And on the folder is written Max 2.5. Yep. Nobody in technical resources has any idea what has a maximum value of 2.5 It's a name. Somebody's name at the research center. That's what it is. Excellent. Are you okay? Yes. You know they put you in the dead man's room? So? I was just thinking get some candles, close the curtains, have yourself a little séance. Ask Pettigrew what the f*ck it was he found before they killed him. Goodbye. Elena : Sheriff! Elena. You attacked Frank. No. No... I was trying to protect... Shut up! Shut up! You attacked him. I am brought in. Questioned. I am asked about Pettigrew. Stop. Stop. Just stop. I just came to say one thing to you. Stay the f*ck away from me. Forget it. You're bad. You are a bad sheriff. Markus : Feed a fever. Starve a cold. When I was a boy my mother used to make this soup for me, Shirley. Cream of chicken broth with little herb dumplings. I used to enjoy being ill. Just for the soup. Mmm. Utterly delicious. Sit up, honey. Sit up, please. Shirley? No thank you. Markus I can't. We're going to have to do something before you fade away to nothing at all. (Knock on door) Max : Yup? Is this room 2.5? Uhuh. Max. Hey. You lost this. That's not mine. Look Before you go down this sort of hopeless road of self-incrimination, I should tell you that Pettigrew made the scan that was in this folder. Now the scan is gone and Pettigrew's dead and I think you know who took it. And I would suggest you tell me or you are probably gonna wind up dead too. Yuri Lubimov. Who is he and what does he do. He's the head of security at the Russian mining town. Vukobejina. He left to go back there today. And you are you frightened of Mister Lubimov? Yes I am. I'll take care of him. Thank you Max. You see, Tavrani, I think all this tourist tat is a smokescreen for what you really are. Tavrani : And what is it that I really am in your eyes, my friend? Henry : You are a powerful man with powerful connections to the old worlds of darkness and grudge. Say it. I think you are a Shaman. (Laughs) Henry. I'm just a stuffer of dead beasts. A peddler of tat. A cigar-store Indian. I can't fix your cancer, Henry. I'm sorry. It's not my cancer that needs fixing. It's not? It's Liam Sutter. The little boy? I believe he needs very powerful protection, Tavi. Something terrible has happened. His young mother is in a state of shock and disintegration. Something is attacking them, I f*cking know it. And I want you to build them one of those things to protect them. What things? It's like a golem. You told me all about it once. You mean a tupilaq. That's it! A tupilaq! If I was a Shaman I would tell you that there is no such thing anymore. If I was a Shaman I would tell you that to complete a tupilaq according to all the old rituals, the creature must finally be baptised in the blood of a murderer. You follow me? Otherwise it will have no power. Now where would a Shaman lay his hands on half a pint of murderer's blood? Mnn? Morton : May I join you? This is a twenty-year-old Mossbank single malt whiskey. Distilled on the banks of Dumfries and Galloway since 1788. And they have it here in Fortitude. Slainte. I've ordered the Lutefisk. Good choice. I thought I am leaving in a couple of days time. Might as well find out the truth about the Lutefisk. Have you ever shot a man? Not with that. Hmff. Barmaid : Lutefisk. Thank you. The truth about the Lutefisk is you shouldn't eat the Lutefisk. (Spits) Ohh! (Slides plate) Liam. Baby. Can you hear me? Can you hear me, Liam? You don't know me. My name is Elena. It was my fault. What happened. Not your dad's fault. It was my fault. I am so sorry Liam. I am so sorry. It was Christmas day when we landed in Scotland, Prestwick. There were six of us, all FBI. And they had a little coach to take us to this town and when we got to the town, Lockerbie. A lot of the houses were still burning. And we were each appointed a local constable. The fella that was appointed to me, his name was Stephen. We were given radios and maps. And a huge sack filled with polythene body bags. So Stephen and I, we set off across this Moor. Every piece of anybody we found we picked up. I photographed it and he bagged it. And we did that all day and all night until our torches ran out. Then we just sat there in the dark. Surrounded by eighteen full body bags, but there was not a whole person in any one of them. And Stephen said, why could they not have just stayed up there. Why did they have to come down? He said, why could they not have just stayed up there. Flying around the lovely world, forever. Jason : sh1t. f*ck you, Ronnie. War stories. You show me your scars and I'll show you mine. This is about Pettigrew. Isn't it? I know what you're doing. Psychology. You're using psychology. (Beep) Henry's voice : Billy Pettigrew wasn't eaten by a bear. He was murdered. Now Professor Charlie Stoddart has been murdered as well. The Governor is responsible. Her sheriff killed them both. (Beep) Someone called in, said they'd seen a man walking out of town, on his own, along the Coastline, without a rifle. Bear season. The time of year when the sea ice is mostly gone and the bears are unable to find seals so they're crazy with hunger. I drove slowly out of town along the coast road looking for the missing man. After ten miles I turned back because nobody could have got that far in this temperature. On the way back I saw a huge bear down on the Foreshore dragging a kill across the rocks and ice-floes. I knew at once what this was going to be. I pulled over, took my rifle. Ran down onto the Foreshore. The bear was leaning over its kill and in the split second I took aim I could see that the thing it was tearing apart wasn't a seal, it was a man. The bear was disemboweling and eating Billy Pettigrew. And Pettigrew was screaming. Inhuman screams. I shot Pettigrew through the head. No witness. No motive. No crime. A mercy killing. Okay. Except... I don't believe a f*cking word of it. (Vomits) Hey hey! Hey! Come here. Sorry, the door was open. When was this carpet changed? What? When was the carpet replaced? Why do you change a carpet? Because there is an immovable stain on it, right? Like red wine or something. But why do you change the floorboards underneath? I don't know. I do. If the stain is blood. Pettigrew's blood.
