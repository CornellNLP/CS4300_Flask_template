 Natalie :  Liam Sutter had an illness and was seen by Dr. Allerdyce. 
 Then Shirley attacked her mom. 
 So what if the doctor is the link? Celia :  There's no doctor on the island, Ciaran. What are we gonna do? Jason! ( gunshot ) Dan didn't shoot Pettigrew. You did. But Dan did this. Tell me, Henry. Henry :  I've shot him in the stomach... ( gunshot ) and he's going to die unless you come and get him. He knows everything. That's the situation, Sheriff. ♪ The river did come to me ♪

What? Truth. Dan :  I think about you all the time. ( chuckles ) You're all I see... in the daylight. Elena :  I have to ask you a question. The truth. I have to ask you a question. That night, Pettigrew... did you kill him? Can I get a glass for the room? ( speaking Russian ) Hey! ( speaking Russian ) Party! ( both grunt ) Dan :  And do you have any plans to leave Fortitude? No, sir. Because you understand that if you... you must tell us if you do. Otherwise, you would be in serious breach of your license and liable to recall. Yes, I understand. That said, you can go. Thank you. Happy Christmas. Feliz Navidad.  ( clears throat ) Are you working later? Always. A lot of Russians in town. Might get rowdy later. What's "rowdy"? Busy. Men drinking and fighting. Well, bars should be rowdy. ( chuckles ) Well, Officer Odegard will be there, so if there's any trouble, you just give him the nod. Can I go now? Mmm. Bueno. Ciao. Knock it off, ladies. ( chuckles ) ( sighs ) No, I'm telling you, Johnnie Walker Diamond Jubilee edition. ( chuckles ) I prefer bourbon. Well, that is just fine with me,  tovarish. I am a broad-minded citizen of the world, not one of your petty nationalists. ( speaking foreign language ) ( dance music playing ) ♪ Hey ♪ Good night. Night, Ingrid. Treasure under the ice. That's a map? ( laughs ) Ah, you haven't a clue, have you? See, that is the beauty of this. There's a million quid there, and you can't even see it. "0-1-6-9." Hey! ( shushing ) ( grunts ) Drinks! Eh. Drinks! Man :  Elena. Hey. Your boys need putting on the ferry. Sort yourself out. ♪ Hey... ♪ Look at you. You're meant to be doing a job here. You work for your f*cking wife, eh?

( spits ) ( water running ) ( knock on door ) ( water stops ) Come in. I brought you some... frozen peas. It was for the drink, not my face. Put them down. ( winces ) It's okay. ( gasping ) I know you, huh? I know you. You're lonely, like me. Now, I could give you $500, eh... but it's not about the money, is it? Hey. ( gasping ) Don't.

Just go home, and leave all this to me! Go! Come here. Come... ( gasps ) Confess... or... you'll never... be at peace. Okay. Henry's gun. Morton's badge. So... Morton followed him up onto the glacier. Yes. To arrest him, question him? Must have been. About what? I don't know. Henry shoots him. Why? What made him want to shoot a man? I mean, Henry Tyson was... He was very ill. Yes. Yes, he was. So when you got there, Henry was dead in the snow. Hmm. Morton was bleeding from a gunshot wound to the stomach. I gave him morphine. He didn't want to be moved. As soon as we make formal identification of the body, I'll have to call London and let them know. More of them will come, you know? I know they will. ( sighs ) Christ. It's not a new hotel we need, is it? It's a bigger morgue. ( chuckles ) ( sighs ) ( chorus singing ) Afternoon. How are you, sir? Who are you? I need to move the ice drill. Says who? The Governor's office. That machinery is not to be moved till all the hydraulics, gearing and rotary motors are checked and tested. Governor's orders. Governor's orders? Could you give me the keys? I have to make a phone call. Whoa! Whoa, whoa, whoa. W-What are you doing? He can identify you. So?! So he can identify me. No, no, no, no! Stop! No, please, Yuri. I won't help you if you kill him.

 ( yells ) ( growls ) ( gasping ) There's a horror show in my head, My hands hacking and hacking. It can't be real. It can't be. ( panting ) Jason. He landed on top of me really close. He was having some kind of fit, screaming, holding me down. Who? Jason. What? He... he attacked you? I'm not hurt. ( sighs ) Jason is... is really sick, psychotic. What... what happened? He was heaving, retching, saying he had to... saying he had to get it out. Then he said he had to get it into him. This behavior, it's the same thing. Liam, Shirley, they both opened up their victim. Now Jason said he had to... to get it into him. So Professor Stoddart, we look inside his chest cavity. We find evidence of whatever it was that... No, no, there's nothing there. A fragment of a fingernail lodged in a rib, nothing else. Petra, Morton, we all saw it. Ingrid, we need to get Jason Donnelly  in custody as a matter of urgency. Dan! Maintenance man in the warehouse assaulted and left unconscious. Somebody busted his skull. Jason? I'll find any witnesses at the warehouse who might have seen the assailant. Get over there. Yeah. Petra, it's Dan. Eric's on his way over. If the maintenance man wakes up, make sure you get a description of his attacker. Are you okay? Yes. I am fine. I have to go. I have to find Professor Stoddart's dog. ( zipper zips ) "Detective Chief Inspector Eugene Morton, Metropolitan Police." I'm so sorry. See ya. Bye. Gave it to the taxidermist? Listen, when large dogs die, we're supposed to dispose of them. But Tavrani asked for it. He has uses for it sometimes. Like grave robbery. It's like Burke and Hare. I don't take any money for it. He says to meet him in the pub. So now we have covered this area. We need to move north. Just get the coordinates for that. 26, and then... ( walkie-talkie chimes ) Dan, I'm at the warehouse. Any witnesses? Well, listen, Dan. The drill's gone. What? Jason took the ice drill. He stole it. Why the hell would he do that? He's off his head. He's stolen the drill. He's driven it away. It's not here. What if it wasn't him? What if it was him? That thing could cause havoc. I'm going after it. Do that. You okay? Am I okay? Well, Carrie and I were wondering if you would like to have pizza again tonight... Pizza? with... I don't have time for pizza. Of course. Well, another time. No, not another time. Not anytime. ( engine turns over ) ( stereo playing music faintly ) You still have the dog? What dog? Professor Stoddart's dog. What do you want with a dead dog? I want to examine it. Ingrid :  Hey, everyone. - ( claps ) Hey, everyone! ( claps ) Some of you know Jason Donnelly or are friends of his. ( music stops ) Well, we have to find him as fast as we can, and if you do see him, don't approach him. Call the police, and let us know. Thanks. Hi, poppet. Can I come in and see Liam now, please, Mrs. Sutter? Yeah, of course you can. Come in. Take your coat off. ( soft muttering ) Hi, Liam. I hear you did something bad. Did you? ( continues muttering ) What is that? It looks a bit scary. I don't think my dad's coming home. I think he's dead. How is your son? He's not spoken much, at all, really, since the thing happened. He's in there somewhere. But he doesn't look at me like he knows me. He just mutters to that thing. What thing? It's a voodoo doll that Henry gave him, a  tupilaq. I looked it up. It's very powerful in Sami culture. But every time I try to take it away from him, he screams his head off. Well, then why don't you ask Henry to come and take it back? Henry Tyson is dead. He killed himself. He shot and killed DCI Morton at the same time. Madre de Dios. The Governor told me. She warned me. Take great care,  and be on your guard. Hey, Frank. How are you? 110%. What's that? Stoddart's dog. Ingrid remembered something. Did she now? I need it unfrozen. Stick it in a microwave. I want to examine the evidence, not cook it. Evidence? Yeah, I don't know. It's a really long shot. He went after the ice drill? Yes. Alone? Yes. You think Jason might have stolen it? Maybe. We won't know till Eric tracks the thing down. Well, if it's not Jason, then it's someone ruthless enough to cave a man's skull in just to steal some... stupid piece of machinery he can't even get off the island. Eric intends to make the arrest and bring the drill back to town no matter who took it. Does he think I even care about that stupid drill now? Does he think that matters anymore to anyone? ( monitors beeping ) ( fluttering ) ( door closes ) I murdered Pettigrew. I took him from the room. That night, I took him away, and I killed him. How? Cuffed him... the pylon on the beach. Waited. Bear came. Bear ate him. Don't say you did this for me. Pettigrew would have pressed charges. They would have taken you back to Spain. He would have walked away. You did not do this for me. What is the truth? He said something in the police car, and it was... It was what? It was the ugliest thing I ever heard, sickened me. What  He... What? He said that we're the same... me and him, that we both wanted you... at any cost... and that... if you said no to me, I would do to you what he did to you... take you by force. I would destroy you. Destroy me. I'd never hurt you. I would never hurt you. You hear me? You are in here. You're inside me. You're part of me. I'd never hurt you. I would never hurt you. I would kill anybody who hurt you, kill myself if I hurt you. What do you want from me, forgiveness for what is inside you? Tell me one thing. Be honest, raw, okay? What did you feel when you saw Pettigrew die? What did you feel when you fed a man live to a wild beast? Tell me. What did I feel? Yes, tell me. I... it felt... I felt... I felt complete. We are two murderers... you and me. And we're alone together. Together. Yes. Together. The behavior we're seeing is complex. It's not just an urge, an appetite. It's directed. There's a goal. What goal? The biosphere is full of parasites. They get what they want. The cordyceps fungus gets its spores launched into the air, turns an ant into a zombie to do that. The liver fluke takes over the brain of an ant, commandeers the body of a cow. Toxoplasma gondii brainwashes a rat. When I got there, I was standing over Professor Stoddart's body, f*cking sh1tting myself, and this dog attacked me. Yeah, you were threatening its master. I was threatening its dinner. Gross. Dog has blood and mucous all over its muzzle. Whatever was inside Professor Stoddart ended up... inside the dog. ( buzzing ) ( fluttering ) ( buzzing ) There's nothing here, nothing visible. No. Even after it was shot, the stomach acid kept working. ( sighs ) Hydrochloric in its stomach's ten times stronger than ours. Not gonna find anything, are we? No. So we're done here. Yes. ( sighs ) Pass me the pen torch. What? Torch. Can you hold this? The alimentary canal, before it gets to the stomach and the stomach acid. Mucus. Yeah. ( sighs ) ( sighs ) It's a grub. Whoa. A larva. What kind of larva? The trouble with larva is you don't know what they are till they pupate and hatch. If larvae are passed into a living host, then that host is food. All larva develop inside, feeding off the living tissue of the host. Dr. Allerdyce. Inside her, they're... that's what's keeping her alive. Vincent, no cutting open live people. It's unethical. We have to to have a look at her. That's all. Nothing invasive. No cutting. None whatsoever. ( chorus singing ) ( monitors beeping ) ( buzzing ) ( buzzing ) ( gasps ) ( mutters ) ( gags ) ( swarm buzzing ) Vincent. We c... we can't open the door. We can't let these things out. What are they? I don't know. Get the sheriff. Okay. Got it. Ready. ( timer beeping ) ( beeping continues, stops )
