 Littlejohn :  Tech Department have enhanced this GPR scan, and you won't believe what Pettigrew found. 
 Hildur :  If it's not Jason, then it's someone ruthless enough to cave a man's skull in. 
 Does he think I even care about that stupid drill now? 
 Natalie :  Jason is really sick. 
 Vincent :  If larvae passed into a living host, then that host is food. 
 Natalie :  The trouble with larvae is you don't know what they are till they pupate and hatch.

♪ Rivers will turn. ♪ ( wincing ) Don't come in! ( stammers ) Don't... don't make noise. What the f*ck are those things? They were inside her...  came through her skin. They stinging you, Vincent? ( gurgles ) When I move, get stung. Wasps. Parasitical wasps. If they get out, this will spread. We have to kill them all. How do we kill them without killing Vincent? Natalie, we have to kill them all. ( gasping ) G-Gas. G-G-Gas. We burn them. Come on! ( gasping ) Okay. This an explosive mix? It's oxygen and hydrogen, very. Okay. Okay. The delivery valves. Open the delivery valves. ( wincing ) ( gas hissing ) Okay, once the room's full, how do we ignite...? Wait. Natalie :  Wait! ( gasping ) ( alarm blaring ) ( electricity crackling ) Vincent. Vincent. Help. Help. Okay, okay. Okay. Okay. There you go. ( panting ) Vincent. He's not breathing. Okay. Um... Don't you die on me. Have you got a knife? Yeah. Okay. Here. It's anaphylactic shock. His throat's closed. Here. Hold him down. Don't let him move. Okay. It's in. ( Vincent gasping ) Shh. It's okay. We've got you. It's okay.  It's okay! It's okay.  We've got you. It's okay. I've got you. It's okay. ( glass clinks ) I'm so sorry, Margaret. ( wind blowing ) 0-1-6-9! 8-3-1-5! 8-3-1-5, 0-1-6-9! Shovel! "X" marks the spot. ( chuckles ) Come, come, Max. What do you think the treasure is? What treasure could be buried out here? Fix this. Fix it? What's wrong with it? Doesn't f*cking work. I don't want to die down a f*cking hole starving in the dark, so fix it. ( singing in Russian ) ( singing echoes ) Parasites that lay their eggs  in a live creature, a live host, then they hatch and consume the creature from the inside out. Margaret Allerdyce was eaten alive from the inside out by insects? I think they're wasps. Wasps. Where have these things come from? Well, they're prehistoric. There's no recorded instance of a human ever being parasited by an ichneumonidae. So this is the first time this species has been in contact with a human population. Because Fortitude has only been inhabited for 100 years. They're way older than that. So where could they have come from? Permafrost? They could survive frozen in the permafrost? If they were in a larval state  inside something else, something that protected them. So we have to find Jason. I'm gonna take you home, sweetie. Your dad'll stay here... do his job. We'll go home... you and me... back to England. You'll see your dad when he visits. ( tupilaq rattling ) Just like when he was a soldier. That'll be best, won't it, everything how it was? That'll be best. Come on. Yeah. ♪ Don't know jillions ♪

♪ I don't know sorrow. ♪ Jason never showed you this, never mentioned what he found? No. I've never seen that thing before in me life. You know he attacked Natalie Yelburton? Jason's out there, and the whole town is in a state close to panic. Where would he go? If he was in trouble, where would he hide? He'd come home to me. He's not himself. Mummy. Jason found the remains of a mammoth. Now we think those remains are hazardous, infectious, so we're all in danger, Celia, all of us, especially Jason. Governor, please. We must find him. Hey, come on. Hi. Dan :  I'm required to ask you if you feel safe in Fortitude. I'm required to ask you if you have any plans to leave Fortitude. Are you seeing anybody? ( Elena chuckles ) Is that an official question? ( winces ) ( sighs ) Frank :  Elena. Forgive me. In my head... the way I felt about you... caused all this pain. Please forgive me. Perdoname, por favor. ( whirring ) Okay, then. Yep, seems to be working fine now. ( snowmobile roaring ) All right? sh1t. Have you told anyone about this place? No. Max. Ah, f*ck. Put the gun down! And get down to your knees! ( speaking Russian ) You! Hey! Hey! ( speaking Russian ) Don't give me this sh1t! Do as I say now! ( speaking Russian ) On your knees! Max! Max! m*therf*cker! Why don't we settle this like real men? With pleasure. We put down the guns. My count. One... two... three. Like real men. ( gun clicks ) What the f*ck? m*therf*cker! Get up! ( both grunting ) ( screams ) ( Yuri gasps ) Oh, m*therf*cker! ( yelling ) ( groaning ) Listen. Okay. Okay, listen to me. This was brought to me by fate. ♪ Crazy... ♪ The glacier hotel is a sh1t, a piece of sh1t. It will never happen. It is not possible! The glacier... moves!

Yeah. ♪ And I'm crazy for loving you... ♪ We go down to the treasure and bring the treasure to surface. What treasure? What treasure?! You know what treasure! Pettigrew found the treasure under the ice! I don't know what the f*ck you're talking about. Don't lie. You know. See? See? They killed Pettigrew for this map. Bill Pettigrew found it, and this is the place. Come on! ( song ends ) ( yells ) ( radio chirps ) 
 
 Ingrid :  Eric, we found Jason. We have him under arrest. Right. I still need to talk to him, so... Okay. Thanks, Ciaran. Listen, I know what happened to you. The thing you found has made you very, very ill. And I know that the mammoth is real. You found it, didn't you? Jason, would you look at me? Now I need you to tell me where it is. Jason, you're the only one who can help us all now. When you tell me where the mammoth can be found, all of this will stop. Everything will be fine again. Listen, Jason. I'm going to trust you now. I'm going to unlock your handcuffs. Governor, he might be dangerous. Give me the key. Okay. So, Jason, where is it? Where's the mammoth? Cold store. Behind the supermarket. Thank you. ( monitor beeping ) ( over intercom ) Poor boy. ( zipper unzips ) These,  they are the reason for all this? The ichneumonidae. Charles Darwin considered  their life cycle to be  inimical to the notion of a benevolent creator. I see. A loving God could not have created something so wicked, or so he thought. "Parasitical wasp larvae." Frozen inside the mammoth 30,000 years. Permafrost thaws. Frozen wasp thaws. Wasp injects eggs into human bloodstream. This is what happened to Shirley? Yes, the eggs develop inside the host,  and the host is compelled to find a victim, hacks open the thoracic cavity,  vomits. Larvae develop inside secondary host. Wasps erupt from Dr. Allerdyce and attack... That's the best hypothesis  I can give you based on the available data, subject to revision. And they are inside him now, these little eggs? Don't know. ( wind blowing ) Hello? Are you down there?! Markus :  What if this theory... is nonsense? What if gentle Shirley Allerdyce attacked her mother because for years  her mother belittled her? What if Shirley was reacting to me  and I am the cause of her pain and self-loathing? No. What? He said, "No." No? We always seek excuses for our baser selves. We are always victims of circumstance, not responsible. Well, maybe when we do bad things for good reason, we must still face the consequences. A child is in torment. A father takes action. Will there be no consequences? You... and you... you cut Shirley open... to further research. Will there be no consequences? We had no choice. Hmm. Well... it is not wasps that should make one doubt the existence of a benevolent God. It is us, his children. ( lock clatters ) ( woman panting ) ( handcuffs clinking ) ( gasping ) ( buzzing ) ( fluttering ) ( chorus vocalizing ) Jason, they've done it. They've set the thing on fire. They've done it. Ronnie's in the house. ( gunshot ) Jason? We've identified a pathogen, and we've identified a marker in the blood which will tell us whether or not someone's infected. Well, that's what I'm saying, Alstad. We can prevent an epidemic if you... Listen, I'll call you back. Look, I know... Please, let me speak. Oh, God. The only thing... that I ever cared for in my sorry life, Hildy, is you. I betrayed you... my love... my only love. I miss you. I miss you so much. I got your drill back. ( chuckles ) Thought you might need it. ( chuckles ) Eric. ( honks horn ) Elena. Elena, I got frozen Bolognese. We can have spaghetti. ( gasping ) Elena? Elena? Elena? ( gurgling ) Elena? ( knocks ) Elena, are you okay? Can I come in, please? Who did this to you? ( gasping ) You're really hot. Get you some water. Elena? Elena? Elena? Elena? Elena, where are you? ( wood clatters ) ( buzzing ) ( chorus singing ) Cordon off the area. Yes, sir. I'm so sorry, Celia. He said that Ronnie's in the house. Ronnie? ( crying ) ( dials cell phone ) Dan...? ( tone chimes ) ( tone chimes ) ( Elena grunting ) ( groans ) ( muttering ) ( wailing ) ( snorts ) ( grunts ) Elena! Don't do this. Please... don't do this. Please. No! ( screams ) ( sighs ) ( Dan screams ) ( music playing ) ( Dan panting ) ( radio chirps ) Dan. Ronnie Morgan's house. Shooting and stabbing. ( gurgling ) ( panting ) ( music playing ) ( sirens approaching ) ( raps on glass ) ( raps on glass ) News? Very few of the 60,000 known species of ichneumonidae achieve sexual maturity within less than 48 hours, so the chances are... that you were only stung. Multiple times in multiple places. But there is a chance that there are no eggs in your bloodstream. Chances?  We'll know. We'll know in a day or two. I would be dead already if it wasn't for you. You know what? It was quick thinking, gas, explosion. ( imitates explosion ) ( chuckles ) Thank you. Thank you. I'm here. I'm here. ( groans ) ( buzzing ) ( fluttering ) M*therf*ckers! ( flamethrower jetting ) ( buzzing ) ( indistinct yelling outside ) ( fire crackling ) ( monitor beeping ) ( shallow breathing ) Dan :  I think about you all the time. ( Dan chuckles ) You're all I see... in the darkness... in the daylight... all the time.
