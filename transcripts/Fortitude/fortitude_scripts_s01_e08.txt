 Eric and I last f*cked two weeks ago. 
 We've been involved since the Solstice Party. 
 I found that where Pettigrew was killed, Ingrid :  Let me know where you're calling from. I don't know.  ( fluttering ) Don't ever do that to me again, 'cause I do this for you. I'll take the tusks. They're onboard. I'll take them now. Come on, Dad. We've gotta go home. I'm going to the mainland in the morning. I don't want to see you before I leave. Yuri :  They're all covering for Eric. They're all in it. Margaret :  Shirley? ♪ The river did come to me ♪ 
♪ Straight into my arms ♪ 
♪ I tried to caress it ♪ 
♪ But it ran through my fingers ♪ 
♪ Water will keep running ♪ 
♪ Rivers will turn ♪ 
♪ Water will keep running ♪ 
♪ Rivers will turn ♪ 
♪ Water will keep running ♪ 
♪ Rivers will turn ♪ 
♪ Water will keep running ♪ 
♪ Rivers will turn. ♪ ( fluttering ) ( wind blowing ) ( dogs howling ) I can reassure you that nothing that has happened recently will in any way jeopardize your investment. ( buzzing ) Um...  we anticipate starting the drilling process in a few days' time, and we're looking at first-phase completion in 12 weeks, all being well. ( buzzing resumes )  Everything looks...  sorry. I just need to take this. Excuse me. Yes? Dan :  It's happened again. Dr. Allerdyce, she's been attacked. And Shirley is missing. I'll go to the government and see how they're gonna help us with this, and then I'll come straight back. But there's no flights today. I'll be back tonight. And, Dan... you keep your head straight. ( breathing heavily ) My breathing has gone funny, Dan. Okay, Petra, look at me. Four seconds in through one nostril. Hold it for four seconds, and then four seconds out through the other nostril. That should steady things a little. Okay? Okay. Ingrid. Make sure the doc can breathe okay. ( chain clinking ) Carrie :  Does your hand still hurt? Yeah, some. We have to go back. Yeah, I think so now. ( gasps ) ( groans ) Are you all right? Carrie. Carrie. Dad? Carrie. Dad? ( panting ) Dad. Dad. I went on a little trip, Henry. Good for you. I got talking to some Russians. They do get very chatty over their vodka. With me, it very much depends on the company. The Russians seem to think that there's something  pretty rotten in Fortitude. How would the Russians know anything? The Russians weren't there. Well, who was there? Who was there when Bill Pettigrew died? Come on, Henry. Don't f*ck me about. I'm pretty goddamn tired of being f*cked about. Okay. The reason I called you, there was somebody there, and I saw him. Big fella, light-skinned, mean eyes. He stank like a reindeer's asshole, which to be fair, was probably the last thing it had eaten. Okay. Okay. I might be dying, Morton,  but watch how you talk to me. I can still tell a hawk from a handsaw and a man from a bear. ( dogs barking ) It's happened again. Doc Allerdyce,  she's been ripped to pieces. Thanks a lot, Henry. ( siren blaring ) Can I get you more coffee? I think two's enough, thank you. If you had an appointment... It's an emergency. You told him I had to fly back this afternoon? Yes. Call him again, please, and tell him it's very urgent. You must feel pretty cut off up there on Fortitude sometimes. Sorry? You must feel pretty cut off, isolated. Cut off from what? Mm, shops, restaurants. I don't need those things to feel connected. And it's not places that cut you off. Could you call him again, please? Yes, of course. Hi. Kent, it's Hildur Odegard. Listen, I need a big favor. Is your plane available? Today. Hi. I came as soon as I heard. I need to take a statement from the first person on the scene. Who is it? Markus Huseklepp, Shirley's boyfriend. And Liam Sutter's teacher, right? You make something of that? I don't know. Shall we? You said you were at the miners' party. Now you know I was there. I saw you, too. Until what time? Until... I don't know. 2:00 in the morning? Then you went home? Mm-hmm, right after I collected my records. Your... your what? I loaned the deejay some of my records. I'm a collector of vinyl, classic '80s mostly. What was the last song he played? "Enola Gay" by OMD. I remember because I sometimes use that song in the classroom to teach the kids about Hiroshima. Yeah. I can see how that would further their knowledge. Well, it gains their interest. It's just a device. Yeah. No, I meant it. I mean, now they'll never forget that it was 8:15. It's good. More than most people know. So you left the party at...? 2:00 A.M. or thereabouts. Dan : That's right. You said that. Straight home? Uh-huh. Yeah, fed Pierre, let him out. Pierre being...? His dog. After Bezukhov. Of course. You know it? Mm-hmm. Put the cake I bought for Shirley in the fridge and went to bed. How would you describe your relationship with Shirley's mother? How would I describe it? We got on very well. That was a stall. Yes, it was. I think that was a stall. Mm. I'm gonna ask you the question again. How was your relationship with Dr. Allerdyce? ( light buzzing ) ( music playing over P.A. ) Somebody's been in here messing about. Over there. ( boots squeak ) ( gasps ) ( gasping ) ( gasping continues ) ( shrieks ) ( wind blowing ) ( gasping ) Carrie. ( groans ) Carrie. Okay. Carrie. Carrie. ( gasping ) Carrie said she saw them from the street and followed them in. Where is she now? At the hotel getting some hot soup. Where's Ronnie? She left him up on the glacier. Arm injury. Sounds like it could be septicemia. I've sent Petra and Ingrid out to look for him. Petra's taken this hard. Well, she's probably in the wrong job then. This isn't Detroit. It's getting close. ( sighs ) Shirley needs a postmortem, but we don't have anybody to do it. Our only medic is trying to save our town doctor. Shirley Allerdyce died of a heart attack. Her hand is clutching the left side of her chest. I'm positive the post-mortem is going to show plaque and blood clots and blackening of the coronary muscle, which is what happens when you have a massive A.M.I. The only visible injuries on Shirley were self-defense wounds on her arms. That was it. And the blood on the wall was from Dr. Allerdyce. Shirley transferred it there. If... if Shirley did attack her mother... No way. No one will believe that. Be careful about saying stuff like that. It's a legitimate line of inquiry. We hold Markus as long as possible. We need to talk to him again. I think he's lying about his relationship with Dr. Allerdyce. I know. Where you going? Check on Carrie. They're holding Mr. Huseklepp at the station. Markus? Why are they holding him? For the attack on Shirley? That's not important. The important thing is it's not Liam. It's not Liam, Jules. I don't get it. I'd rather not get it. Not getting it's better. Until now, getting it meant Liam was guilty. You need to slow down, Frank. It's ridiculous to think a kid that size... You need to let the police handle this. But I need to know. I need to know what we're dealing with here, Jules. Who are you really trying to get off the hook? ( scoffs ) "A." Have you found him? No, not yet. "F." He knows. He knows? I'm a mind reader. I know people better than they know themselves. Wow. He doesn't even know what he had for breakfast. I didn't have any breakfast, and I could do with a coffee right about now. Elena :  She was a good person. Yes, she was. Yes. But there are some questions. ( sighs ) She had no injuries. She was soaked in her mother's blood. She had defense wounds, which are... I know what they are. And her heart attack could have been brought on by... No. No. Well, I said, "Could." We don't know yet. No. Shirley was incapable of that kind of violence. I'm not trying to blame Shirley. I'm... I'm just trying to understand what's happening to us. How is she? Scared,  but coping. Look after her? Okay. At least until we find Ronnie. Okay. Okay. Dan. Whatever's happening to us, Shirley was a victim. There's something else going on... something that's worse. Dan, what the f*ck is going on? Pretty busy just now. But it was the teacher that found 'em? Not "them." He found Doc Allerdyce. Dan, how much do we even know about this guy? You know, Frank Sutter says... Oh, you see Frank, you tell him to come and talk to me. This is outsiders, Russians probably. Thanks for the tip. Well, you should be rounding them up, interrogating them. I've got a lot on my plate. And some asshole just out of Donegal talking about rounding up outsiders, I could do without that just now. If you don't, we will. ( crying ) Man :  It's a disturbing development, as you say. Yes. You must be concerned about its implications for your hotel project. No. I'm concerned about its implications for the island. Indeed. Well, I shall take it up with the subcommittee. Good. When? We meet on Mondays. But that's too late. We need help right now. There are competing demands. Involving people being ripped open? Look, I'm not unsympathetic. I'm not asking for sympathy here. I'm asking for forensic teams. You know we're facing cuts right now. Two attacks might seem a lot on Fortitude. You're not going to send any extra resources, are you? I think it will be difficult to persuade people of the urgency. Right, because we are a small, faraway island that doesn't matter. Of course you matter. Because we have a dying economy. We have a falling rate of childbirth. We have no votes. Because if we're lucky, we might survive as a remote weather station. Your car is here. Thank you. Right. Thanks for the coffee. ( dog barks ) ( dog barking ) ( panting ) ( barking continues ) ( cell phone rings ) Hildur :  It's me. I was calling you. I wasn't answering. I got that impression. Is Dr. Allerdyce still alive? She still has a faint pulse. I'm coming home. How? Well, Kent Larsson has that little Learjet. But you're scared of flying. Wait for a proper flight, Hildy. ( rock music playing over P.A. ) Want to know something funny? They're playing Buddy Holly in my lobby here. That's not funny. You want to know something else? Remember how I always hold your hand at takeoff? I'm not scared at all now of anything. So at least you've achieved that. ( dogs barking ) ( growls ) ( barking, yipping continue ) I'm not far now, Carrie, darling. I'm not far now. Oh, God, I'm poisoned. I'm so f*cking poisoned. ( sobbing ) ( cell phone chimes, buzzes ) What else did you do last night? ( spits ) Henning saw you. What are they doing to that man? Take his f*cking trousers down. Are you cold? Are you cold? Do you want to freeze to death? Henning saw you. Hey. Hey. Hey. Do you understand me? What are you doing? Just asked him a few questions. Russian b*st*rd spat at me, too. No, you can't do that. A bunch of them were drinking last night. We just want to know what else they were doing. Carrie, come. Do you know the names of these men? Ciaran Donnelly. Jake Roach. And that's Henning Bergstrom. 
 
 Come. Slut. Don't worry about him. Nobody likes him. My dad says he's a knob. Yeah. Yes. I want to go home. Carrie, you can't stay on your own. But you could come, too. There's loads of room. We could wait there together for dad. Okay. Okay. Where have you been? At the teacher's. There's all other kinds of weird sh1t, funnels and scales and stuff. What's all this? Where did you get this? His house. I broke in. Why? I knew he wasn't there. He's a feeder. Yeah, not only that. Where is it? Huh? Leave this with us. Now what you gonna do? What's more important right now  is what you're going to do. You're going to go look for Ronnie. No, I want to be there when you question him. No. Oh, for Christ's sakes, Dan. Frank! Last night, you punched me in the face,  and I did nothing. Today, you broke into a man's house, No, it's him.  and possibly  jeopardized our investigation, so be very clear. My next step will be to arrest you  unless you make yourself scarce and go look for Ronnie. But it's him. He's a freak, and he's got my son involved in all this weird sh1t. Frank, listen to the sheriff. We'll handle it. How did you... Never mind that. Well, these were taken during a hunting trip. It's tradition here to anoint the kids with the blood of the first kill. I want a lawyer. That can be arranged. I'm not answering any questions without a lawyer. Okay. We can do this without questions. I'm not having any... We'll talk about literature. I read this book once. It was about religion, and I'm not a particularly spiritual guy. You surprise me. And there was an image in the book that stuck with me. It's the image of the world as an aquarium... and inside it is human life, like all the little fishes. And we're looking at them from all different perspectives and angles and in different lights. Peeping Tom. Yeah, I guess so. Yes. Something like that, yeah. Maybe that's what God is, a voyeur, great cop up in the sky looking down at us. That's an interesting thought. Anyway, I look into this aquarium, and I see Markus, Markus the town schoolteacher, the lover of Russian literature, of dogs, of classic '80s vinyl. And I also see Markus... who's a man that has a very interesting relationship with his mother. I'm assuming that is mom. My mother has nothing to do with this. Why... where you get these things? No questions, remember? Goes both ways. Do you want to tell him? Shirley Allerdyce... is lying in the morgue after attacking her own mother. Shirley? She's dead, Markus. We found her dead. Your girlfriend, just like Liam Sutter was your pupil. How... I never... I would never hurt... I loved her. Love? You were feeding her to death. I'm innocent. No. One way or another, you're a killer. I don't know. You don't know what? The signs, what you're looking for. You throw all this stuff at me... and you obviously want some reaction. He remained calm. He got angry or sarcastic, tearful. And all I feel... is like laughing... like I'm just going to laugh. ( seabirds calling ) When do you anoint it? With the blood, I mean. When it is ready. When I was a boy, we used to go down to the beach. One time, during the war, we found an American airman sitting down there all alone outside his tent, just staring at the sea. We cheeked him. "Hey, mister, And he said he was just about to go on his last mission. Packed up, gave us what was left of his food, and we watched him head off... just like that. No lonely impulse of delight. No rage at the dying light. ( chuckles ) Just matter-of-fact. So you never knew if he survived? But I wish I could be like that airman. Maybe he's living in retirement in Idaho. Do you believe, Henry? Do you truly believe this? Doesn't matter what I believe. People need myths and stories. Dan :  So what do you make of it? Oh, now you want my opinion? I didn't say I liked you. ( chuckles ) ( sighs ) I think a man who's playing a part laughs. He doesn't say he feels like laughing. Do you know what I mean? I think we should let him go home and feed Pierre. You think we should let him go? Yeah, because what do we have? Morton : Weak, circumstantial stuff, a bunch of psychological nonsense, and a lot of inadmissible weirdness stolen from his house. I suspect a lawyer will have a lot of questions about that. I guess we can always reel him back in. Yeah, but I don't think he's the fish that we want. ( projector whirring ) Carrie? Love, are you here? Carrie? Carrie, love, are you here?

Dan, we've got a serial killer on the loose, and you want us to stay calm?! We don't know if we have a serial killer. So far, the casualty rate is one. Oh, what about poor Shirley? We think she died of natural causes. Natural causes? Don't give me that, Dan. This is all down to us! The island won't let us do this. It will shrug us off. The animals are already showing the signs. Tell them. I'm a newcomer. I don't think... In general, I'm not sure about that kind of Gaia theory. I think it works more as a metaphor than science in many ways. But it's true. There appears to be  some strange behavior among the animals here. I think... And what are we doing? Building ice hotels? Investors over people every time for the governor. You don't know what you're talking about, you old coot. Come on. Investors are people. And they're the only ones that matter to her, aren't they? You sharing the kickback, are you? Shut your mouth, Henry! ( gunshot ) ( screaming ) Hold fire! Who fired the gun? I shot my f*cking foot off! He shot himself accidentally. Get that idiot out of here, and find him a plaster or something. Charlie, man up. It's just the end of your toe. Put your guns down, and keep your safeties on, for God sakes. Dan, why'd you release the teacher,  - Markus Huseklepp? Yeah! ( clamoring ) He's obviously connected. He's been manipulating people in some way. Shirley, my son Liam, Dan :  Okay, okay. ( clamoring ) Wait! Wait up! Don't you tell me to wait up! Nobody knows anything about him. Exactly. Bring him in, and ask him... Would everybody just hush up  so Jules can speak? People are scared, Dan. That's all we really want you to understand here. Nothing like this has ever happened here before. This isn't Fortitude. My son, my little boy, is just lying there, and we need answers. I know. I understand. We don't need your understanding. We need to know what you're gonna do about it. Exactly. Now you sort this out, or we will. Oh, yeah, how? By shooting off a few more toes? This is your job! It's not ours! You're the f*cking Sheriff! You've got kids, do you?! You're the one we pay to take care of sh1t like this. We need answers. Now! I've just been to see Margaret Allerdyce, our doctor,  and I... I sat by her bed, and I thought about all the times she's helped me and been there for me, for all of us, really. She gave us our jabs. She came out in driving blizzards when our children were ill. I want us to think of her for a moment. Let's have a moment of silence and thought for our good friend who's lying in a hospital bed right now, fighting for her life. ( wind blowing ) Thank you. Now if we can all stay calm, I'm sure we can work together to overcome this difficult time. Celia :  We need help from the mainland. Yes, and we will have it. Carrie : There should be a spare key under the bin. Okay. Crossed fingers. Is it? Here? Is it? Great. ( projector whirring ) How come that's on? I don't know. ( electricity crackles ) What happened? It's okay. It's okay, Carrie. Um...  do you know where the fuse box is? It's by the backdoor. Okay. Wait. ( gasps )  ( giggles ) Carrie. Come on. Oh, dear.  ( giggles ) Show me the way. Night, Eric. Night. Sheriff! I thought that the governor handled that very well. Well, that's why she's the governor. You handled it pretty well, too. "Casualty rate is one." Good point. Yes. Assuming that Bill Pettigrew was what you said he was and not a casualty. Ask me any question you want. Don't worry. I will. ( chuckles ) Okay. Okay. See you tomorrow, then. Yep. ( distant dogs barking, howling ) ( knocks on door ) ( knocks ) Hey. I was with Carrie. She's asleep at last. Good. I just wanted to check and see if you were okay. We're fine. Bit of a scare when all the lights went out, but it was just a fuse tripping. Okay. You were nice earlier with Carrie... kind. She's a good kid. We need to find her dad. She says I'm like her big sister. Do you like that idea? Yes. Yeah. ( laughs ) ( sighs ) Space and light, that was all I wanted when I came here. I haven't handled things well, Elena. What things? Us. What us? ( Carrie screams ) Carrie! Carrie. My dad, he was here. I saw him. Carrie, there's no one here, okay? I think it was just a dream. Okay? ( kisses ) Come on. Let's get you back to sleep. Okay? I have to try and get her back to sleep. Okay. I'll go. ( whimpers ) I'll call you in the morning. Okay. Okay. Let's go. Hmm? ( silverware clinks ) ( music playing ) ( Pierre barking ) Hey. Hey! Hey! Come on. ( yells ) ( singing in Spanish ) ( hums ) Rest now... ( speaks Spanish ) ( speaking Spanish ) ( floor creaks ) ( wind blowing ) ( panting ) ( groans ) Now pay attention, because it's my turn to take the lesson. It's truth time, you fucker.
