 Will you calm the... 
 Oslo knows nothing, neither does she. 
 Your research was sponsored by Schenthal Biotech. 
 It's a pharmaceutical company. 
 There was some kind of scandal involving healthy human beings. 
 You shouldn't believe everything you read. 
 Natalie?! 
 Communes with the spirits. Heals the sick. 
 Sometimes. 
 We can stop him before it's too late.

 Hey. 
 Hi. 
 I need to find Governor Odegard. 
 Hildur Odegard isn't the Governor anymore. 
 I-I still need to find her. 
 Yeah. She lives in the Blue Fox now. 
 Her and Eric have split up. 
 Thanks. 
 Or maybe it's just a trial separation of some sort. 
 And everything will work out after a break. Hard to tell. 
 (DOOR OPENS) 
 He's dead. 
 Muscimol. 
 Five or six hours. Heart failure, I think. All the indications. 
 This is shamanistic ritual. 
 I think the killer is a shaman, Eric, and I think Tavrani was involved in shamanism, too. The killer needs parts from human bodies... Hindemith, Bianca, the graves. If we can understand what he's thinking... 
 Stop, Petra. This is Voodoo. 
 Madness, delusional f*cking fairytales. 
 She's right. 
 If we can understand what he's thinking... 
 Get inside his way of thinking... 
 His world view... 
 I don't even know what my own wife is thinking! 
 It's not snow-blindness. Pupil reactions are normal. 
 No inflammation in the eye tissues. 
 No engorgement or retinal ischemia. Ocular pressure is normal. 
 The OCT and MRI scans show up no abnormalities. None. 
 What if... what if this whole thing is effectively psychological? 
 You mean my eyes can see, but my brain doesn't want to look at what my eyes are showing it? 
 I'm talking about an intense neurological event prompted by stress and exhaustion resulting in a temporary blindness. 
 So I'm not... I'm not blind, I'm just mental. 
 A psychological reaction to the wasp trauma. 
 Wha-wha-what about if it's a physiological reaction to the wasp trauma? 
 Well, then Doctor Adebimpe would have found a physiological explanation... 
 With his little ophthalmoscope and his torch? 
 Plus the OCT and MRI scanners. 
 The parasite that attacked me was subtle, malicious, insidious and... and... a f*ck of a lot smarter than anyone in this room, so... 
 (INDISTINCT CHATTER) 
 Found anyone? 
 What? 
 Suspect. Made an arrest? 
 No, the investigation is, err... is... it's ongoing... 
 Coffee? Irish maybe? 
 This is from me, Dan. From all of us. 
 Drink up. 
 What do you want, Eric? 
 Finish the job you started. Drinking yourself to death. 
 You don't have any idea what you're dealing with. 
 I'm dealing with an alcoholic. 
 Governor Munk says you broke into Doctor Khatri's home and threatened her. 
 You don't know what you're doing. 
 If you weren't threatening her, then you're mentally unstable. 
 One or the other. Which is it to be? 
 Arrested or sectioned? 
 Eric... you're not a f*cking sheriff. 
 Thank you. 
 Mister Mankyo, my friend, I am so, very, very sorry. 
 Bianca was a beautiful soul. 
 A lovely young woman, and my heart goes out to you. 
 Mister Mankyo has asked me to lead the room. 
 To lead...? 
 Bianca was in my choir, Mrs. Odegard. 
 Hey... 
 You okay? 
 Oh, this coffee's got whiskey in it. 
 No... this whiskey's got coffee in it. 
 Munk said on the phone that they're not paying him enough money. 
 He said he'd made Eric sheriff because he could control him. 
 Everyone, please? 
 (CLEARS THROAT) 
 Bianca Mankyo has been taken from us. 
 We have lost a beautiful daughter, a dear friend and a very talented student. 
 Her father has asked that instead of words, we say farewell to Bianca with music. 
 This is a piece Bianca loved, the whole choir loved. 
 So this is for her... 
 ♪ Little Lamb who made thee... ♪ 
 (ALL) ♪ Dost thou know who made thee. ♪ 
 Someone has to fix this. 
 (SINGING IN BACKGROUND) 
 Make sure all these people are safe again. That's all that matters. 
 You won't find him. 
 Listen to me very carefully because what I'm telling you is important. 
 You shot Elena. You left her in that state. In that bed. 
 Persistent, vegetative state. You! 
 And then you ran away! 
 (SINGING CONTINUES IN BACKGROUND) 
 (CAN HEAR CHOIR SINGING) 
 ♪ ...His name. Little lamb, God bless thee! ♪ 
 This town does not care about you anymore. 
 It's him. That's him! 
 (WHACK) 
 MOVE YOUR HEAD!!! 
 ERIC!!! 
 Everybody! Stay inside! 
 Dad! 
 Come on! 
 (SCREAMS, MOANS) 
 Hong. Not with the knife. Hong! 
 (SLAP) 
 (KNIFE FALLS ON THE FLOOR) 
 All right? 
 (SOBS) 
 It's all right. 
 It's his tongue. Isn't it? 
 It's him. He took Tavrani's tongue. 
 (THRILLING MUSIC) 
 Go that way! 
 Alright. 
 (GUNSHOTS) 
 Eric! 
 Eric! 
 Who shot? Where is Eric?! 
 Over there. He shot him. 
 POLICE! COME OUT! HEAR ME?! 
 COME OUTSIDE NOW! 
 COME OUTSIDE! 
 (BARKS) 
 (GUNSHOTS) 
 (NERVOUS BREATHING) 
 (CHAINS RATTLE) 
 (THRILLING MUSIC) 
 (MUSIC STOPS) 
 (FOOTSTEPS) 
 There's no-one. Just that dog. 
 I didn't see a dog. 
 There was a dog. 
 (ZIPPER UNZIPS) 
 What is it? 
 Eric? Eric? 
 What is it? 
 (VOMITS IN HIS MOUTH) 
 (CLEARS THROAT) 
 You can... 
 You can confirm...? 
 Bianca Mankyo. Yes, that's her. 
 (CLEARS THROAT) 
 You had him. 
 He taunted you and then you let him get away. 
 I shot and wounded him. 
 Is that a fact? 
 And then he turned into, err, a big dog and ran off into the blizzard. 
 I didn't say... 
 That's exactly what the other men are saying, Eric. 
 Perhaps... 
 Someone killed Bianca in the muscimol den and put her body where we found Hindemith's body, because they wanted us to think it was the same killer when it wasn't. 
 So we could be looking at two killers, and one is a copy cat... 
 There are no such things as Copy Cat Killers in the real world! 
 They're made up! 
 I want this killer found. You understand?! The killer! 
 The one killer in Fortitude! 
 Find him! 
 Michael, it's me. There's a package in my room. 
 I think it's from Dmitri Podnikov. 
 Documents and film. 
 Um... sixteen millimetre I think. Okay, see you then. 
 What do you know about Doctor Khatri? 
 Dan! 
 Hildur. 
 Wh, why do you ask me that? 
 I think she's been doing bad. 
 Doing... bad? 
 To Elena. 
 I don't understand what you mean. Elena's condition is intractable. 
 Who SAYS?! 
 Everyone in the specialist team who examined her. Listen to me, Dan. 
 Khatri is in a terrible position. 
 She can't simply let Elena die, that's not a possibility. 
 As long as there is life there, Khatri has to treasure that life. 
 We all do. 
 You have to let her go. 
 (KNOCKS) 
 Shut the door. 
 You f*cking idiot. 
 Careful. 
 They have found her head. 
 Not possible. 
 I f*cking saw it. In a yellow bag. 
 It's not possible. 
 Where the f*ck did you leave it? 
 Down a deep hole. 
 Well, they have it. 
 How? 
 Some lunatic in an anorak led them to it. 
 Where? 
 Some f*cking... shed. Hanging from the rafters. 
 A spotlight illuminating it. 
 Neon arrows... Big flashing sign... 
 Who is he? 
 The mad fucker who cut the other guy's head off. 
 Jesus. 
 I didn't sign up for this bloodbath. 
 Right. This is what has got to happen, this is what you're going to do. 
 I need you to... 
 Fatty. 
 What? 
 Shut up. 
 Di... Did you just call me fatty? 
 You're an amateur. Stay in your room tonight. 
 Drink your vodka and in the morning, it'll all be fixed. 
 
 
 
 This simply must hurt like the very devil. 
 Yes, it does. 
 But... I keep the pain inside... for when it's needed. 
 Needed? 
 Err, what I have to do in this place... is going to take... an agony of pain. 
 Why did they shoot you? 
 The little girl who was killed... 
 Another man killed her. 
 You know who murdered Bianca? 
 I will. 
 I will know him. 
 Why are you here? 
 (GROANS) 
 There's a demon. 
 A demon? 
 It's been on earth before. 
 My grandfather knew him then and now, now it's me. 
 You saw the blood aurora? 
 The demon brings it. 
 So that he can find the souls he's looking for. 
 (GROANS) 
 No. You should stay here tonight. If you move, you could bleed. 
 Yes. Yes. 
 Vladek. Cou, cou, could, could you you help me? 
 Make me whole again? Stop this thing in me? Hmm? 
 This demon. 
 Could you? 
 (MACHINE BEGINS PLAYING FILM) 
 What is this, a post-mortem? 
 Don't know... 
 He's been opened up before. Right down the middle. 
 It's-It's, err... Pretty slapdash. 
 There was a disaster. 1942. Near Vukobejina. 
 Hmm. 
 A weather station. A Sami settlement. 
 Everyone was killed. 
 Except him I think. 
 What killed them? 
 He did. 
 Anything else? 
 Something about regeneration. 
 What the f*ck! He's not dead! 
 Oh, my God. 
 (MACHINE SHUTS OFF) 
 Tissue regeneration. 
 What? 
 They hurt him and he healed. The damage was reversed. 
 (HE GRUNTS) 
 They think they, they discovered something... 
 Discovered what? What? 
 Tissue regeneration. Is that real? 
 They could reverse tissue damage? 
 Vincent was attacked by the wasps... 
 Yes. 
 He was stung upwards of two hundred stings. 
 Yes. He went into anaphylaxis. Windpipe closed up. 
 I had to perform a tracheotomy on him. 
 You saved his life. 
 Also... I blew him up in a gas explosion. 
 There were no eggs laid, no larvae? 
 No. 
 Nothing that matched Elena's experience or the others who all died? 
 He was stung. Just stung. 
 I think you have to consider sending Vincent away. 
 Away where? 
 To a less challenging environment. 
 You've ruled out parasites and pathogens. We're familiar enough with conversion disorder. 
 No... 
 Hysterical blindness. 
 Some people aren't cut out for such challenging work in dangerous circumstances. 
 He almost died saving the rest of us. 
 And maybe that heroism was not truly in his character. 
 Now he pays the cost. 
 Mum... 
 You okay? 
 Wasn't expecting you home... 
 Oh, I'm so f*cked. 
 Yeah... You look it. 
 (GRUNTS) 
 Oh. We nearly had him. 
 Eric thinks he shot him, but we're not sure. He got away. 
 That's good. 
 (SILVERWARE CLINKING) 
 What are you cooking? 
 Luttefische. 
 Really? What are you making that stuff for? 
 Nobody in their right minds eats Luttefische these days. 
 Mum? 
 Who's been bleeding? 
 Rune... (NERVOUS CHUCKLE) Rune must've put it... Yeah, he must've... 
 Mum, who's this for? 
 I just thought I'd make some... 
 Ingrid! 
 Ingrid! 
 SHOW YOURSELF! 
 POLICE! NOW! 
 Ingrid! Stop this. Stop this, please. 
 (GASPING AND PANTING) 
 Was he here? Mum! Tell me! 
 Was he hiding here? 
 Look at you. The state of you. You're exhausted. 
 Co, Come inside with me, please. Hmm? The luttefische, an old recipe. 
 I remembered it. 
 Promise me? 
 I'd promise you anything, child, anything. The whole world. 
 (SOBS) I'm sorry. 
 It's okay. They make you see things a young woman... should never... 
 Dislocate... 
 Yeah, yep. Okay. (INDISTINCT) 
 (SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYS) 
 So the exact... the exact date that I can tell you... is the 2nd of... 
 January. 
 Absolutely! 
 What do you do...? 
 Give me your security pass. 
 What? 
 For your lab. 
 What?! 
 This explodes in the air and lights up the sky with shards of incandescent phosphorus. 
 You're a scientist. You know what phosphorus does. 
 Yes. Imagine it exploded inside a car. 
 I haven't done anything to deserve such a thing. 
 Is that what you tell yourself? 
 I don't know what you mean. 
 The girl you have in that glass box. Elena Ledesma. 
 I killed a man for her. 
 No. Please. 
 I find my sense of smell's heightened. 
 Of course right now, in this car, the overwhelming smell is fear. 
 Does that surprise you? 
 I find I can tell the difference between pure fear, and fear tainted with guilt. 
 And the last thing I expected... 
 There is no smell of guilt. 
 I was in a place called Aruwamba. Ebola outbreak. 
 People liquefied from the inside. We collected their body fluids. 
 Mopped up their remains and examined them. 
 I felt no guilt or shame amongst all that death because out of it, our work brought hope and possibility. 
 I stank of vomit and blood and human excrement every night. 
 But never guilt. 
 I have to say goodbye to Elena. 
 Give me that. 
 (SOBS) 
 I told you a big lie, Vincent. 
 (BUZZING) 
 I told you they were all dead. There were none left alive. 
 I can hear them. 
 You can see them. 
 (BUZZING) 
 No. 
 Yes. We needed to bring them back to study them. 
 We burned them all. 
 I have a scientific responsibility. An obligation. 
 You know that. 
 Not to me? 
 I shouldn't have lied to you. 
 You were in so much trouble and when we brought the roof down on that glacier... lying to you seemed right. 
 And you think I'm lying to you now. About my eyes. 
 No. 
 One of us is. 
 Are you lying when you say you love me? 
 Is this what it looks like... Your love?

 Ingrid, Petra! 
 Stock control in the airport souvenir shop says this bag was sold by a franchise branch in Berlin. 
 Fourteenth February, 10:31 a.m. 
 Airport security video. 
 February fourteenth... Berlin flight connects at Oslo, 16:25. 
 Oslo flight arrives in Fortitude... 
 This is disembarking... 
 Catches everyone... arrivals, misses luggage. 
 Yellow holdall. 
 That's our man.

 Not a limb and not the head or any other part of... 
 I know. Dan made us practice this, Eric. 
 Listen to me. This man killed Bianca Mankyo. 
 He'll kill to avoid arrest, don't doubt it. 
 If we have any reason at all to fear for our safety, we shoot him. 
 Okay. 
 We shoot the fucker in the face. 
 I know.

 A monster.
