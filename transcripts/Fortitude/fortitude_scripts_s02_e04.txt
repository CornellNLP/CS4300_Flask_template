 Where is everyone? 
 What brings you to Vukobejina, Governor? 
 (SPEAKS IN RUSSIAN) 
 The deer was eating it. 
 Bears prey on reindeer. Not the other way round. 
 Torch is dead. 
 Who's been living with you? 
 The demon is among us. 
 We're going to die. All of us! (SCREAMS) 
 INGRID!!! 
 Tavrani's tongue was cut out. 
 He spoke to Tavra. I've heard the voice before. I think.

 Hindemith gave us drugs, Mia Yeva, he used the Reindeers... used them to make the muscimol. 
 The animal... is exhausted. 
 There where other people there sometimes, I don't know... an older woman. 
 I don't know who she was! 
 But worse than Hindemith, worse than anything was the man... who had no face. 
 When he was there, everything was different. 
 Girl, bring light. 
 He was the cold from outside, maybe he was death! 
 Don't hurt her. 
 (GUNSHOT) 
 Don't... 
 Bring me the fresh one. 
 He brought darkness with him. 
 That who came in here, the man who had no face. 
 And he got to Tavrani and he made him scream until he couldn't scream anymore. 
 You never saw him anywhere else... without the snow goggles? 
 I never saw his face. 
 Hindemith was nuts. 
 But that guy... he scared the f*ck out of me. 
 Hey. It's going to be okay. 
 Eric, Munk's coming in. He wants a progress report. 
 (GROANS) 
 Still, that won't take long. 
 Tavra will talk. 
 Someone cut out his tongue, Eric. 
 He can write, can't he? 
 He won't protect someone who cut his f*cking tongue out! 
 You're the Sheriff. 
 Hong. 
 My daughter, Bianca. 
 She didn't come home. 
 Thank you. 
 Still nothing in either eye? 
 Not a f*cking thing. 
 And there was no kind of warning? No fogging, no blurred vision? 
 Erm, just, just, just that headache. 
 Well, it doesn't sound like a tumour. That's good news. 
 Is that the end of the good news? 
 It's pretty f*cking good, Vince. 
 We need to get you back, now. 
 I'll call, get the chopper out. 
 This happened to a friend of mine at UCL, week before Finals. 
 She went totally blind in one eye, sitting on the toilet. 
 Two days later, fully recovered. She got First. 
 What was her name? 
 What do you mean, what was her name? 
 This "friend" or yours, erm. What was she called? 
 What was her name? 
 Julie. 
 You never mentioned her before. 
 It's not the sort of thing you'd chuck into a conversation, is it? 
 I'll have a dry white and by the way, I once had a friend who went blind on a f*cking toilet! 
 I'm sorry. I'm sorry, Natalie! 
 (SIGHS) 
 You're not going to like this. 
 Tavra had a heart attack this morning. 
 The stress of the mutilation, plus there's a history of arrhythmia. 
 He's alive, but we can't talk to him. Not now. 
 Rune's girl was in the muscimol den. We should find her. 
 Yeva. 
 I need to speak to Munk. 
 (DOOR OPENS) 
 Hey. 
 How was Vuko? 
 (LAUGHS) 
 Cool. 
 In fact... I was thinking, now that we've sold the boat... we can afford to move there. 
 You sold it? 
 Yeah. Agreed the terms, shook hands. 
 I'm sorry. 
 Ah. 
 So now, what I want, is to find a doctor. 
 The best damn specialist there is. 
 Michael... 
 We talked about this. 
 No. You talked about this. 
 Freya... medicine, it comes on all the time. Trials, breakthroughs, new kinds of treatment. 
 Michael, we can't fix this. 
 Now we need you to fight this thing. I need you! 
 We always taught the children to pick their fights. 
 You taught them that. 
 (KNOCKS) 
 Dr. Khatri, what can I do for you? 
 I need Dan Andersson's medical records. 
 You must know, they are confidential. 
 In all matters of public health in Fortitude, I have the full authority of the W.H.O, the Norwegian government and of course the governor. 
 I wasn't aware of that. May I ask what your concern is? 
 Aren't you the least bit surprised by his recovery? 
 I believe in miracles. 
 I don't. Especially the recent test results. 
 (DOOR OPENS) 
 Good morning, Eric. Everything okay with you and Hildur? 
 What? Of course. Why? 
 No reason. So, what do we have? 
 It's Bianca Mankyo. 
 The killer? 
 No. The headless girl. We identified her. 
 Was she a prostitute? 
 What? 
 So often young girls found dead have been involved in that sort of thing. 
 She wasn't a prostitute. 
 She was a sweet, kind, girl who worked at the supermarket and someone cut her f*cking head off. 
 The taxidermist? 
 We can't be sure of that. 
 But the taxidermist killed the geologist. 
 We're not ruling that out. 
 But not the shop girl? 
 It's too early to say for definite. 
 What can we say... for definite? 
 It's all about muscimol. 
 Muscimol? 
 A local narcotic drink made by feeding poisonous mushrooms to reindeer and then collecting the urine. 
 Which is then drunk. 
 Are you making fun of me? 
 No. The liver separates the narcotic from the toxins. 
 It connects all the victims: Tavrani Tavra made it, Hindemith drank it and Bianca was killed where they took it. 
 So we're dealing with a turf war in this er... this drug? 
 No. 
 We're dealing with a f*cking psychopath. 
 (DOOR SLAMS SHUT) 
 Vladek? 
 You shouldn't climb the ladder, Freya. You might fall. 
 How did you know? 
 Always. 
 I'll bring you something to eat. 
 (KNOCKS) 
 Hildur. 
 Do you have a moment? 
 (SIGHS) 
 I'm sorry, Hildur. There's nothing I can do, Oslo made its decision. 
 I have something to tell you. Which... 
 I under, I understand how upset you are. 
 And believe me, this is not my dream job. 
 I, err... just came back from Vukobejina. 
 There's, err... some kind of crisis there. 
 The port is closed, I saw soldiers on the streets... secret service people. 
 Why are you telling me this? 
 I believe they are suffering a disaster, like we did. 
 Erling, our government needs to know about this. We need to make contact with the Russians, we need to cooperate and share information. 
 Let me share something with you. 
 Have you any idea how lucky you are? 
 You have been paid actual money... to stop governing this freezing sewer with its flesh eating wasps and headless f*cking corpses. 
 But still you come here, into this shitty little office, trying to make yourself look important! 
 Have you any idea how sad and ridiculous you look? 
 (SCOFFS) 
 This freezing sewer was my life, and nobody has the basic human decency to say sorry, or even f*cking why! 
 And you don't deserve this shitty little office. 
 Eric. Dan tells me there was another killing. 
 Where were you last night? 
 Err, I had to stay over in Vukobejina. 
 Were you alone? 
 Eric, please. 
 I asked you a question. 
 I'm staying at the hotel for a while. 
 Who were you with? 
 I can't go on like this. 
 WERE YOU ALONE? 
 (BEEPING) 
 (MACHINE WHIRS) 
 (DOOR HISSES) 
 (DOOR BEEPS) 
 (SCANNER BEEPS) 
 Dan. Hong... 
 Eric. 
 I bought you some rock salt. 
 I'm cooking a meal. 
 You don't have to do that. 
 Oh, it's not for you. 
 I'll bring back a doggy bag. 
 Thank you. 
 May I see her room? 
 (SOBS) 
 Bad morning? 
 (SCOFFS) 
 You? 
 (SIGHS) 
 Wanna talk about it? 
 Not really. You? 
 Michael, I have to do something, err, difficult and illegal. 
 I need your help. 
 You okay? 
 Sure. My friend's been murdered, there's nothing I can do. 
 Apart from that, it's all chilled. 
 You tell Eric everything, right? 
 About Bianca, the muscimol, the people you saw in that place? 
 Is he really the Sheriff now? 
 Don't get me started. 
 Get in. 
 It stinks of booze in here. 
 Ingrid, Petra, get to the cemetery. I've reports of a fire. 
 (ENGINE STARTS UP) 
 Supposing you can break into Munk's room, his computer, it must have a password. 
 Of course. I called his old secretary in Oslo to get it. 
 Oh, and she just blurted it out, right? 
 No, but err, she's been having an affair with him for years and it would be bad for her if her husband found out. 
 I see. Woah. 
 You really are, you're just so pissed off at everybody, aren't you? 
 I gave my life to that job, I want to know why I lost it! 
 Munk will have discussed it on email with his superiors. 
 If they have acted improperly, I can force them to re-instate me. 
 Just move on. Get another job. 
 You know, what normal people do. 
 I have another job. I got an email this morning. 
 An old friend in Oslo, he has a PR firm. 
 It's a lot more money, plus car and pension package. 
 Well, Hildy, that's... great. 
 Yes, it is. 
 You'd be nuts to turn that down. 
 Yes, I would. 
 Congratulations. 
 Thank you. Yes or no? 
 
 
 
 (SPLASHES) 
 Vladek. What are you doing here? 
 You brought me here. 
 Brought you? What are you talking about? 
 Just now. In your dream. You called me. 
 You summoned me up from the world of the dead. 
 What? 
 (LAUGHS) 
 No, you... You left the house with a big stripy towel and a swimming costume. 
 (SPLASHES) 
 (LAUGHS) 
 So, you currently reside in the world of the dead? 
 You know... it's a place I'm very familiar with. 
 It's as real as this place. 
 Are you crazy? 
 Maybe. I don't know, I suppose. Like all of us. 
 All of us what? 
 I'm a shaman. 
 A shaman? 
 Like a witch doctor? 
 No. Not like a witch doctor. 
 Okay. Erm... A spirit healer. Communes with the spirits. 
 Walks among the dead. Heals the sick. 
 Sometimes. 
 Why don't you prove it to me? 
 (TAKES A DEEP BREATH IN) 
 Are you guys ever going to catch this psychopath? 
 Shut up. 
 Someone made a big fire? 
 Yeah... To soften the earth... 
 Yeah. It's an old grave of a child. 
 Oh. 
 Tavra... I totally know what all this is. All of it. 
 I think. 
 (PHONE VIBRATES) 
 Yes. 
 (INDISTINCT CHATTER) 
 You shouldn't call me here. 
 (INDISTINCT CHATTER) 
 It's still early, but the results of last night's hepatectomy are incredibly encouraging. 
 There's clear evidence of complex tissue regeneration. 
 (INDISTINCT CHATTER) 
 Indeed. Maybe what doesn't kill you really can make you stronger. 
 Dan Anderssen. 
 I strongly recommend a contingency plan to be put in place. 
 (CRASH) 
 A grave has been desecrated. A little girls remains have been stolen. 
 Her name is Suluk Tavra. I know she is an ancestor of yours... 
 And I know what he is going to do to her soul. 
 So do you... 
 We can stop it before it is too late. 
 If you decide to help her... You know where I am. 
 (MACHINE BEEPS) 
 (CLANK) 
 (CAR'S SECURITY ALARM SYSTEM CHIRPS) 
 You're early. 
 Hi. 
 Cybercrime division, Oslo. 
 Two stoners and a dog. 
 (MAN ON PHONE) Are you there? 
 Yes, I'm here, thank you. 
 You find the girl? 
 No, but Petra has a theory. 
 Me too. 
 She went to the hospital. 
 Rune told me that Bianca's hobby was hacking into official government systems and leaving short messages of peace and hope. 
 But he also said she passed on information she found, she recently gave your father some crab data she got illegally from FARC. 
 And now her laptop is missing! 
 (NERVOUS CHUCKLE) 
 So my father had her rubbed out? 
 I didn't say that. 
 (LAUGHS) 
 He was in Vukobejina with your wife the night she was killed. 
 Can we rule him out now? 
 (POURS WINE) 
 You seem tense. 
 Not at all. 
 Tell me a little bit about yourself. 
 I'm an only child. 
 I attended the local comprehensive school and won a scholarship to read medicine at Cambridge. 
 I did my postgraduate degree at Oxford, then a doctoral thesis at M.I.T. 
 Vector genetic variations in host-parasite antagonistic coevolution. 
 Your research was sponsored by Schenthal Biotech. 
 It's a pharmaceutical company quoted on the New York stock exchange. 
 I know what it is; I was just surprised you knew. 
 There was some kind of scandal, I seem to remember, about clinical tests involving healthy human beings. 
 You shouldn't believe everything you read. 
 That's good advice. An interesting field, medical ethics. 
 Should we allow one person to die if it saves lives of millions? 
 Joseph Stalin wasn't a doctor. 
 No, but he knew how to liquidate his fellow men. 
 I think we're ready to carve. 
 (GROANS, SCREAMS) 
 (BANGING) 
 Every action, equal and opposite. 
 Reaction. 
 (BANGING, BELLS JINGLE) 
 Peace without turmoil. 
 (TAKES A DEEP BREATH) 
 (BELLS JINGLE) 
 I put my hand upon you. 
 I put my hand upon you. 
 (SIGHS, INHALES) 
 I am inside your sickness. 
 (GASPS, INHALES) 
 (BREATHES DEEPLY) 
 (FREYA GASPS) 
 (PANTING) 
 Get a beer. 
 Hey. I gave you two hundred. 
 No, it... It was one. 
 Oh, it was definitely two. 
 You gave me one. 
 It was green. Two hundred Krone notes are green. 
 You're currency expert too! 
 Well, at least I can f*cking count. 
 You gave me one hundred. 
 You forgot to add the milk. 
 (MUSIC PLAYS LOUDLY IN BACKGROUND) 
 Governor? Michael Lennox. 
 I'm only acting Governor. 
 (LAUGHS) 
 I was, err, wondering if I could take a little bit of your time? 
 This wine is awful. 
 Isn't it though? Hong's supermarket too! I'm shocked. 
 You've made a remarkable recovery. 
 From what I understand. 
 He's a bit of an old woman. 
 Who is? 
 Dr. Adebimpe. 
 Do you have any pains in your left lower back at all? 
 My left lower back? 
 It's where the human liver is located. 
 No. All good. 
 What about the abdomen, generally? 
 Never better. Generally. 
 Nausea, vomiting? 
 I wish. 
 Where've you been for the last nine weeks, Sheriff? 
 You c**t. 
 (ERLING SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY) 
 (INDISTINCT CHATTER) 
 Eric. 
 Michael. 
 Did you need to see me? 
 No. 
 I was just wondering if you've been f*cking my wife? 
 I think I would have remembered that. 
 (BOTH GRUNTING) 
 (CROWD SCREAMING) 
 Calm the f*ck down! 
 (SCREAMS) 
 (COMMOTION IN BACKGROUND) 
 (SIGHS) 
 Enough! Enough! Enough! 
 (GUNSHOT) 
 (SCREAMS) 
 Okay then. 
 Dad? 
 (TYPING) 
 (FOOTSTEPS) 
 (SIGHS) 
 (WATER BEGINS RUNNING) 
 (PHONE RINGS) 
 I called you this morning. I left messages. 
 No, I am NOT f*cking calm. 
 I didn't sign up for this sh1t. 
 There are bodies all over the place. It's monstrous! 
 (MAN ON PHONE) Then you're fine. 
 No, I need more money. 
 (INDISTINCT CHATTER) 
 No, he, he thinks it's all about drugs or something like that, he knows nothing, he's an idiot, that's why we made him Sheriff. 
 No. Oslo knows nothing, neither does she, don't worry. 
 No. She, she came to me this morning with some story about Russia. 
 It's a joke. 
 It's under control, but I need more money. 
 (MAN ON PHONE) Are you sure about this? 
 Yeah, I mean it. 
 (KNOCKS) 
 (MUMBLES) 
 (GRUNTS) 
 I'm sorry about that. 
 Ah! It wasn't your fault, forget it. 
 No, I feel bad. Let me buy you a drink. 
 No, no, no need. Really. Good night. 
 Now, I feel really bad. 
 (SIGHS) 
 (FORCED CHUCKLE) 
 (SIGHS) 
 I had such a lovely time. Good night. 
 (DOOR SLAMS SHUT) 
 (COUGHS) 
 What? 
 Didn't you hear that? Something moved out there. 
 What? Like an animal? 
 It tried the handle of the half track. 
 Are you sure? 
 No... What are you... Don't go out. 
 I could do that. 
 But I'd sit in here all night scared shitless and trying to stay awake. 
 f*cking chopper. 
 Don't go out! 
 Zip up after me. 
 (WIND BLOWS LOUDLY) 
 Natalie? (UNZIPS) 
 Nothing out there? 
 I need you to stop f*cking about, zip the tent up. 
 (PANTING) 
 Natalie... 
 Tell me about Dan Andersson. Everything you know. 
 (MUSIC PLAYS LOUDLY) 
 (MUSIC CONTINUES TO PLAY LOUDLY) 
 (CRASH) 
 POLICE! 
 SHOW YOURSELF! 
 I want this killer found. The killer! 
 The one killer in Fortitude!
