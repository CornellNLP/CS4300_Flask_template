 Katya : Previously on Allegiance... 
 Alex : Somehow we need to alert the task force that the operative in charge of Black Dagger is on his way here. 
 And tell them what, that you snuck away from a covert CIA operation to follow a suspected terrorist on your own and all you have is a blurry photo to show for it? 
 What am I supposed to look for to spot someone who might be working for the other side? 
 So it's the boy genius you took under your wing. 
 Faber : You should keep an eye on him. 
 So what's your secret, Alex? 
 Are we dating? 
 Yes, we're dating. 
 You have a girlfriend. That's awesome. 
 Can we not tell Mom about this? 
 You and Alex? s*x? 
 I did not see that coming. 
 Jozef! 
 I am sorry for your loss. 
 Michelle : You've seen the operative who's running Black Dagger in person, and rather than tell me or Sam or anyone, you pursue it on your own. 
 There's a mole, I think, in the task force. 
 Back, back! 
 Show me the picture. 
 I need an hour. 
 Hurry. 
 Don't.

 911, where's your emergency? 
 distorted voice : It's my neighbor, Michelle Prado. 
 She's having a terrible fight with her boyfriend next door. 
 It... it's a terrible fight. 
 Sir, I'm gonna need you to slow down. 
 Now, what's the address? 
 471 Edgewater Street. 
 She's in apartment 3A... hurry! 
 Okay. 
 And your neighbor's boyfriend... can you describe him? 
 man : Late 20s, blonde. 
 I think his name is Alex O'Connor. 
 Alex O'Connor, okay. 
 Want you to stay by the phone, all right? 
 Gonna send a squad car out.

 [indistinct radio chatter] 
 This feels hopeless. 
 It isn't. It just takes time. 
 There's so much footage. 
 Even if we do get a clear shot of him, matching that to this, that's nearly impossible. 
 [doorbell chimes] 
 woman on radio : 91 Charlie 17, 10-34 domestic. 
 Resident Michelle Prado at 471 Edgewater Street, unit 3-Adam. 
 Suspect is 25 to 30, white male, blonde hair, first name Alex, last name O'Connor. 
 Call him. 
 [cell phone ringing] 
 Katya : Alex, what's going on? 
 Huh? 
 The police were just dispatched to your partner's apartment for a domestic disturbance with you. 
 What are you talking about? 
 Were you guys just having a loud fight or something? 
 No, she just buzzed me in. 
 [knock at door] 
 Michelle? 
 Is she there? 
 I just tried her door, and it was open. 
 I'm gonna make sure she's okay. 
 Katya : No, Alex, this doesn't feel right. 
 You could be in danger. 
 Alex : She could be in danger. Michelle? 
 Michelle. 
 Michelle? 
 Is everything okay? 
 Alex. 
 Let's call Natalie. 
 She could be there in ten minutes, less. 
 Alex : Michelle? 
 Michelle. 
 I don't see her. 
 Katya : Alex, somebody called 911. 
 Somebody is trying to... 
 No, it's okay. She's just... she's just in the bathroom. 
 Michelle? 
 She's just taking a shower, I think. 
 Michelle. 
 Katya : Then how did she buzz you in? 
 Michelle. Mich... 
 She's... she's not here. 
 The shower's running, but she... 
 I think... 
 I think there's blood. 
 Katya : Don't touch it. 
 I just did. 
 Alex, get out of the apartment right now. 
 We got to go there, now. Come on. 
 Michelle. 
 Michelle? 
 Michelle. Mi... Ma... 
 Oh, my God. 
 Oh, my God. She's behind the couch. 
 Michelle? Michelle. 
 [stammering] 
 Mom, she's... she's been shot. 
 Alex : She's not moving. 
 Where? 
 Where was she shot? 
 In the chest, I think. 
 Do you see any blood coming out of the wound? 
 Is there any blood coming out? 
 I can't tell. It's soaked. 
 Michelle? 
 Is there any blood oozing out? 
 Do you see any blood movement? 
 I don't see any. I have to call 911. 
 No, no, Alex, you have to stabilize her if she's alive. 
 Katya : Put your face down to her nose and her mouth. 
 Do you detect any breath? 
 She's not breathing at all. 
 [crying] I have to call 911. 
 No, Alex, don't call 911. 
 Do you understand? 
 Why? Why not? 
 You're being framed. 
 Come on, let's go. 
 What? 
 I don't care. I have to get her help. 
 Katya : No, Alex, she's dead. 
 She's already dead. 
 Her chest wound isn't pumping blood. 
 She's not breathing. Her skin is cold. 
 She's gone, and there's nothing that you can do to save her, but you can save yourself. 
 You are being framed for her murder. 
 That is what is going on, and you have to listen to me very carefully about what happens next. 
 Alex : Okay.

 Yeah, hey, my neighbor's blasting some friggin' war movie or something, and I've asked her nicely, like, a million times to turn it down. 
 Some of us got to work tomorrow morning, you know?

 Well, with a domestic call, we'd like to take a look around. 
 We can have a supervisor come by if that's a problem. 
 No. 
 Sure.

 9 Charlie 12, go. 
 Be advised, 10-34 might be a false alarm.

 Says the resident is watching a movie. 
 That was that bitch in 4G, wasn't it? 
 You got a problem? You can't say it to my face? 
 Got to call the cops?

 Just missed 'em. 
 What are you thinking? 
 I'm wondering why I smell bleach. 
 Mark : You have to change out of those clothes. 
 Victor brought you these. 
 I told her. 
 What? 
 I told Michelle about Black Dagger, about seeing the triggerman in Rome. 
 Why? 
 Alex, we had a plan. 
 I thought we needed help to stop Black Dagger. 
 I trusted her. 
 She's not the problem, Alex. 
 How much did you tell her? 
 Everything. 
 You told her about us? 
 Natalie : About Dad and Mom and me? 
 No, not that. 
 Well, now you understand why I lied to you for so long. 
 In this world that we're trapped in, being honest with someone can get them killed. 
 We shouldn't stay here. 
 No, he's right. 
 We need to get rid of the evidence right now. 
 I'll go with him. 
 No, I'll go. 
 I'm not gonna let you get rid of her like something to be disposed of. 
 Alex, we are going to figure out who did this. 
 And then what? 
 Mark : Then we're gonna track him down and kill him. 
 Good. 
 I'll get changed. 
 [engine turns over] 
 We need to track the 911 call made by whoever's trying to frame Alex. 
 I can probably hack the 911 server, but, guys, whoever did this was trained and careful. 
 If he is the SVR mole... 
 Of course he is. 
 He'll have good tradecraft, probably a burner phone, voice alteration. 
 He will not be easy to catch. 
 But we will catch him. 
 Burner phone, voice alteration, whatever. 
 None of that matters if we can find the phone number and the exact time the 911 call was placed. 
 Then what? 
 Then we get into the phone company's database, triangulate the cell towers the 911 call flowed through, then geo-locate where the killer made the phone call from. 
 I mean, there are 500,000 surveillance cameras in Manhattan alone. 
 If we can find out where that call was made, I bet we can get an image of the person that made it. 
 Victor : How do you know about this place? 
 Alex : I researched furnaces when I was trying to corroborate your colleague Irina Semovetzkaya's story about Mikhail being burned alive by the SVR. 
 It closed down three months ago. 
 There's a crematorium in the basement. 
 You sure it still works? 
 No. 
 If it doesn't work, then we can do it your way. 
 My mother died when I was ten years old. 
 Every day after school, she'd set out these little tea cakes for me. 
 One afternoon, I came home... nothing. 
 Just my father in the kitchen, smoking. 
 You're with Natalie, aren't you? 
 [sighs] How long? 
 Off and on for years. 
 Do you love her? 
 Yes. 
 Then what are you still doing here? 
 It's not so simple just to run. 
 Stay, the Rezident will eventually find out about the two of you, about this. 
 If we left, you'd never see her again. 
 But she'd still be alive. 
 Get her out while you still can, or next time, she could be the one rolling around in the back of a van.

 Sam : So she's not answering her phone. It's a Saturday. 
 Well... 
 Look, Michelle and I go back. 
 This is a rough time of year for her. 
 Yeah, we go back too. 
 Well, then you know it's the anniversary of her sister's death. 
 For all we know, she could be on a bender. 
 Wouldn't be the first time, but she's only been missing for 18 hours. 
 She asked us to meet her yesterday after work, specifically off site, out of the office. 
 We get to her house. She's not there. 
 Why's the door unlocked? 
 Hmm? 
 Yeah, that bothers me. 
 Right? Why is there a droplet of blood on the floor outside her door? 
 Did it come back as blood? 
 Still at the lab, but, Sam, it was blood. 
 But there wasn't any blood anywhere else in the apartment, right? No. 
 So you should get a warrant and go over there with the CSIs. 
 Already tried. 
 Judge said he'll reconsider it, but he said 18 hours missing wasn't long enough to get a warrant. 
 Didn't I just make a similar point? 
 There could be alternative explanations for all of this. 
 Why hasn't O'Connor called you back yet? 
 Sam : Come on, Jason. 
 You were the one fingering him for the mole not two days ago. 
 I told you I was wrong. He was... 
 Nailing the girl who's now MIA. 
 It's been 18 hours. 
 Maybe Michelle had suspicions too. 
 Maybe she confronted him, found something incriminating. 
 People do very strange things when they're cornered. 
 Violence is just a whole different thing, okay? 
 I don't see how Alex can do anything to hurt her. 
 Well, maybe he had help. 
 What, like the SVR? 
 Exactly like the SVR. 
 Hopefully you're right. 
 She shows up in a few hours with a nasty hangover, but if she doesn't, something happened to her, the list of suspects isn't long, and it certainly includes Alex O'Connor.

 Like she was kidnapped, maybe worse. 
 Why would they think that? 
 They were supposed to meet her at her apartment last night. 
 She wasn't there, the door was unlocked, and there was a tiny drop of what has now been confirmed as blood in the hallway.

 Use a sheet. 
 Alex. 
 You went away from me there for a second. 
 I'm sorry. I just... 
 I don't want to think something happened to her. 
 Yeah, no, I don't either. 
 You know, her sister died five years ago tonight, so I'm hoping she just went somewhere, got sloppy drunk, maybe checked herself into a hotel or something so no one would know. 
 If it wasn't for the blood, I'd be sure that's what it was. 
 Natalie : We got to move the body now! 
 And it may not even be her blood, so... 
 You can't tell? 
 No, Bureau doesn't have blood samples on their employees, not yet anyway. 
 It was her blood type, O-positive, but that's the most common type in America. 
 Even if it was her blood, a single drop doesn't exactly signify a struggle... more like a nosebleed.
