 Katya : Previously on Allegiance... 
 Alex : The operative in charge of Black Dagger is on his way here. 
 Katya : Do you know the name Oscar Christoph? 
 Operative for hire, assassin. 
 He's dead. 
 He's not. 
 If we want a life, our life, we leave now or we never will. 
 Alex : Natalie's gone with Victor. 
 The O'Connors are on the run. 
 Alex has been branded a traitor. 
 Alex illegally accessed classified files from Special Agent Prado. 
 We're bringing him in. 
 Alex, this is Special Agent Faber. 
 You've been set up for murder. 
 You brought me here to find out who else knows about Christoph, not to stop Black Dagger, but to make sure it happens. 
 You're the mole. 
 That's him. 
 That's the guy that murdered Michelle. 
 Don't. 
 We have to find him. 
 [Taser clicking] 
 [screaming] 
 [grunts] 
 Kill him now! 
 Mark : Faber saw us, the SVR, the task force, everyone. 
 We can't go home. We can't go to the hospital. 
 We're on our own now. 
 Sarah. 
 Mark : We'll get to her first. 
 [cell phone vibrates] 
 Sorry about the heat, folks. 
 Maintenance said it'll be another couple hours, but we're gonna get started anyway. 
 Given everything that has happened, we have to assume that our Midtown offices have been compromised. 
 Until we stop Black Dagger, this is gonna be our new HQ. 
 All right, be sure to thank O'Connor for the new digs, once we catch his sorry ass. 
 [door beeps] 
 Alex O'Connor, the prime suspect in the murder of his partner, Michelle Prado. 
 He is a traitor, and now he is a fugitive. 
 I want every airport, bus depot, train station locked down. 
 If he pops his head up, I want us there to take him down. 
 Where the hell you been? 
 I've been driving all over Queens looking for this rat's nest. 
 Ever hear of Google Maps? Even has its own app now. 
 Yeah, yeah. 
 But, folks... 
 We need to be careful. 
 Alex O'Connor did not escape his hotel room by himself. 
 He had help. He knew we were coming. 
 Whoever he is working with, you're gonna need to assume that they are every bit as dangerous as he is. 
 [tires squealing] 
 Mark : She's not picking up. 
 Sarah, it's Dad. 
 Listen, you are in danger, honey. 
 I want you to find someplace in the building. 
 I want you to hide there. 
 I want you to wait there until I can find you, okay? 
 This is not a joke. I love you, sweetheart. 
 Damn it! 
 Okay, you don't think that somebody... 
 No, no, she keeps it on silent during lessons. 
 Alex, [speaks Russian]. 
 Talk to me. Stay with me. 
 I think he's going into shock. 
 How much time do we got? 
 I don't know. I don't know. 
 A half an hour maybe. I don't know. 
 I can't stop the bleeding. 
 He needs coagulants, probably a transfusion. 
 Well, we have blood in the storage unit. 
 I could drop you off. It's on the way. 
 No, we have to get Sarah. 
 No, no, sweetheart. We don't have time.

 The truth is, no matter what the official explanation, we don't know exactly what caused the Aleutian Wells blowout, but we suspect a pipeline valve failure. 
 Umm Al-Quwain, '99. 
 San Gabriel, 2004. 
 West Virginia, 2012. 
 All valve failures. 
 All led to enormous corporate losses in dollars, environmental damages, human life. 
 These valves have a proven design flaw. 
 I know it's not cheap to replace them, but it's really just a matter of time until the next disaster happens. 
 Thank you. 
 [applause] 
 [indistinct chatter] 
 Are you enjoying the local cuisine? 
 Oh, I should've known better than to order Italian in Germany. 
 It's not Germany. It's the hotel bar.

 Oh, you would think that, and then they all go home and bury their head in the sand. 
 [sighs] No one listens until a city block blows up somewhere. 
 That's sort of my curse. 
 Ah, like Cassandra. 
 Apollo gave her the gift of prophecy, hoping to sleep with her, and when she refused, he gave her the curse of never being believed. 
 [laughing] Yeah, sort of exactly like that. 
 I'm Marcos. 
 Elizabeth. 
 What company do you work for? 
 Diario Norte.

 Why couldn't they just leave us alone? 
 Hi. I was hoping to make a dinner reservation. 
 Certainly. Did you have a restaurant in mind? 
 The best that I can walk to... not Italian. 
 How many dining? 
 One. 
 Of course. I can get you for one at Borchardt. 
 It's a classic. 
 You don't want to eat there. 
 Uh, checking out... 708. 
 The chef's secret weapon is truffle oil. 
 He bathes everything in it. 
 What if I love truffle oil? 
 You don't. 
 You were picking the mushrooms out of your Bolognese last night. 
 There's a Viennese bistro a metro stop away. 
 The roasted duck will change your life. 
 I don't talk to journalists. 
 Talk to journalists. 
 I know. 
 I submitted my story on the conference an hour ago. 
 My flight is at 11:00. 
 I will have you back by 9:00. 
 But if you prefer Virginia Woolf to me, I can't say I blame you. 
 Okay, you were totally right. That duck was ridiculous. 
 Oh, I'm glad you enjoyed it. 
 So dare I ask? 
 [clears throat] What do you write about? 
 Injustice, strife, things that need to change. 
 Saving the world one keystroke at a time? 
 [chuckles] 
 I started as a sports reporter years ago. 
 I was, uh, there to cover a football match. 
 One day I saw black pillars of smoke from my hotel room... each a half mile thick. 
 Some sort of horrible disaster had occurred. 
 I drove out to the source. 
 An oil well was on fire. 
 I can't imagine how many must've been killed in that disaster. 
 [inhales deeply] And then I saw them... the villagers, just going about their daily business, paying no mind to the inferno. 
 It was no accident. 
 The blaze was set on purpose to ignite the gas on the top so the crude underneath could be excavated. 
 The heat was like hell on Earth. 
 Children cough up tar. Adults die in their 40s. 
 The water is foul, the air polluted, but the world goes on. 
 So what did you do? 
 I wrote two stories that trip. 
 The one about the football match got 800,000 views. 
 And what about the fires? 
 1,402. 
 [scoffs] 
 And to this day, they still burn. 
 So you're a bit of a Cassandra yourself, then. 
 [chuckles] 
 [laughing] Maybe so. 
 Do you ever find yourself in the States? 
 From time to time. 
 Why? 
 I thought maybe we could do this again if you're ever... in New York. 
 I might like that. 
 Natalie : I don't understand. 
 We did everything right. We paid cash. We used aliases. 
 I made a mistake. How else could they have tracked us? 
 Maybe they tailed me when I went to the bank or when I bought the car. 
 Somewhere I was sloppy. I almost got us killed. 
 We're okay. We survived. 
 [cell phone vibrates] 
 Oh, no. 
 What? 
 My family... they're in trouble. 
 What happened? 
 Alex is hurt. We have to go back. 
 Back? 
 Into the lion's den? 
 You sure you were not followed? 
 I could spot an FBI tail in my sleep. 
 I taught the damn course at Quantico. 
 Have your men killed the O'Connors yet? 
 We're working on it. 
 Well, while I admire the confidence, if they go to the authorities, they're gonna have a hell of a story to tell. 
 Their son is a fugitive wanted for murder. 
 They can't go to the FBI. 
 We're watching the hospitals. They have nowhere to turn. 
 We'll find them. 
 There's something else that needs to be taken care of. 
 What? 
 Somehow Mark and Katya knew to plant a tracker on me. 
 They knew I was dirty before they knew my name. 
 If there's something in that house that points to me, it needs to be cleaned up. 
 It's too hot for me to use an SVR team right now. 
 You'll do it. 
 Me? 
 Do you know what happens to me if I got caught? 
 That is your problem. 
 If the FBI finds anything on you, you are no longer valuable to Moscow, Agent Faber. 
 You understand? 
 Yeah. 
 Katya : My father forced me into service for the Russians when I was only a little older than you are now. 
 I didn't want that life. 
 And then later I met your father, and we fell in love. 
 Working for them, that... that was the only way that we could be together. 
 You have to believe us, honey. You have to. 
 There are dangerous men out there, really dangerous men, and they're planning to hurt a lot of innocent people. 
 And we are trying to stop them. 
 Then why can't we call the cops? 
 Because the cops... they would not believe us. 
 Why? 
 They think Alex did something... something bad. 
 S-something bad? 
 They think Alex killed someone. 
 Katya : But... but he didn't. He was framed. 
 Sarah, wait. Wait, wait, wait, wait. 
 [sighs] 
 [door opens, closes] 
 We always knew this day would come. 
 Yeah, well, now it's here. 
 [sighs] 
 Where are you going? 
 Home. 
 We got to get that laptop with the footage of Faber outside Michelle's apartment right after the murder. 
 We can get it to the FBI, prove Alex didn't kill her. 
 No. No, Mark, the SVR could be sitting on the house. 
 I'll go through the back. 
 If anyone's there, I'll see them before they see me. 
 Be careful. 
 Yeah. 
 
 
 
 [door opens] 
 [breathes deeply] 
 Alex : When I found out about Mom and Dad, I was mad too. 
 They always raised me to do the right thing. 
 And all this time, they were living this lie. 
 Even when I figured it out, they kept lying. 
 When I confronted them about it, Mom told me she was having an affair to cover up the truth. 
 That's what we were talking about that time you came into the dining room and I told you to go to your room. 
 I wanted to turn them in. 
 I nearly did. 
 But this thing we're trying to stop, Sarah, it's... it's bigger than just our family. 
 So I helped them. 
 I helped them break the law. 
 I lied... to the people I work with, to people I care most about. 
 I lied to you, Sarah. 
 I saw Dad kill someone today. 
 He stabbed him right next to me. 
 I'm sorry.

 Sam's a CIA station chief. 
 He has access to everything on Christoph. 
 If I can get a look in, I might be able to find a pattern in his operational tactics, an MO, something that would give us a lead onto him or Black Dagger.

 My hotel... I escaped because Faber called me to warn me. 
 He guided me right past you. 
 How else do you think I knew you were coming? 
 He told me you were the mole, Sam. 
 He told me he wanted to help me. 
 I went down the service stairwell to the lobby and hid behind the concierge desk and ran across to another hall, which led to the loading dock. 
 He unlocked it from the outside. 
 He was waiting on the other side of the street. 
 He took me to a warehouse and tortured me. 
 He tried to kill me. 
 But let me guess... you managed a miraculous escape. 
 I was bound to a chair. 
 I sliced my wrist open on a screw so that they would take the handcuffs off. 
 When they did, that's when I managed to escape. 
 That's quite a story, Alex.

 You wanted him to meet you at my parents' house.

 He said he had to put on some clothes. 
 "Unless you want to see me in my Jockeys," he said. 
 Check the cameras in the Brooklyn-Battery Tunnel, 
 2:00 to 3:00 a.m... gray Crown Victoria. 
 He drove me to a warehouse in Red Hook. 
 I was lying down out of sight in the back seat, but you'll see him on the cameras.

 Did you find something? 
 In 1989, the CIA tracked Christoph into Indonesia before his trail went cold. 
 Three months later, a fuel truck blew a tire, swerved off the road, and crashed into a refinery outside of Jakarta... 
 50 dead, $500 million in losses. 
 In 1994, the height of the Rwandan Civil War, Christoph is spotted in the Congo. 
 Six weeks later, a massive grain silo funded by the UN explodes, killing a thousand Hutu refugees and starving countless others. 
 It was attributed to a stray spark igniting a dust cloud. 
 There are others... catastrophes at water-treatment facilities, coal mines, power stations. 
 Every single one of these events shifted geopolitical power in one direction or another. 
 He makes his attacks look like accidents. 
 And he uses existing materials from his targets as the fuel source for his bombs. 
 You found a pattern. 
 This definitely narrows down the potential targets for Black Dagger, no?
