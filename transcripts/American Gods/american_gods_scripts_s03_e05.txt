 Demeter is most certainly my wife. 
 Oof!

 Not for my money?

 In the summer of 1893,  on the shores of Lake Michigan,  the United States took its place on the global stage. 
 Not through war, but through technological innovation. 
 The World's Columbian Exposition  also introduced the Ferris Wheel,  the moving sidewalk, Juicy Fruit gum,  and Crackerjacks. 
 All things seemed possible  as technology leapt into the modern age. 
 The future looked brighter than ever. 
 And, in its shadow, hucksters, con men,  and grifters plied their craft as they had  since the dawn of civilization.

 She doesn't want to leave? 
 Yet, my boy. 
 She doesn't want to leave yet. 
 A touch of the Stockholm Syndrome. 
 She simply needs reminding  of how much she has to offer the world, huh? 
 It's an esteem issue. 
 Well, she was your wife. 
 What the hell has that got to do with anything? 
 Wives come and go. 
 - What? 
 - You don't get yourself locked up  in a mental institution for people who just "come and go". 
 She's also a goddess. 
 I want her to be on the winning side of history, okay? 
 Tell yourself whatever you want. 
 I did my bit. 
 And beautifully you did it too. 
 Now, I'll take it from here. 
 The real work begins now, okay? 
 What? 
 Whatever you're actually after here,  I hope it's worth it. 
 Shadow Moon. 
 - Hey. 
 - Hah! 
 Let me have a good look at you, hmm? 
 Hmm... 
 [chuckling] 
 Yes. 
 You're a lot like him, hmm? 
 Yeah, uh... 
 [chuckling nervously] 
 I'm, I'm not sure that's a good thing. 
 Uh, well, hmm. 
 Being with your father... 
 ...was like opening a bottle of champagne. 
 Bang. 
 Bubbles. 
 Complete intoxication. 
 ♪  But time... 
 [chuckling] 
 ...takes its toll. 
 [chuckling] 
 But Ofnir and I endured so much together, didn't we? 
 Yes. 
 But the pain of loss can cause  even the heart of a god  to grow smaller and colder. 
 Until the only thing that remains... 
 ...is a memory of what could have been. 
 It was good to see you again. 
 You too.

 Don't we all need to do a little better job  of listening to each other?

 You know I'm right.

 Pot pie is the special of the day,  and they say there's more snow on the way. 
 Hey, what's the, uh, what's the deal with this? 
 Three more break-ins since Alison went missing,  some sicko is stealing ladies' unmentionables,  and folks are starting to think  it's all the same person. 
 Okay. 
 You? 
 I'm from Missouri on that one.

 Miss, your order is on its way,  but around here, we are known for our pasties. 
 First one is always on the house. 
 Eat it while it's still warm, hon.
