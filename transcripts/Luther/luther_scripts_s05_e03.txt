 You robbed me, George. 
  All right, what do you want? 
  I'm a thief. 
  I've robbed you. 
  Oh, when you kidnapped his son and tried to do him over. 
  James was our one contingency. 
  - And now it's thrown away. 
  - I'm sorry. 
  We have to be absolutely sure you're not developing any problems with impulse control. 
  Because what's the rule? 
  - Play safe. 
  - No, he's a heart specialist. 
  - Whose head was he looking at? 
  - That woman is a debt you owe me, John. 
  - I want her. 
  - I'll bring her to you. 
  There's always option two: we kill him and run. 
  Er, George sent me. 
  I am, er, welcome home present.

  I am. 
  (CLEARS THROAT) 
  I just get carried away. 
  (SIGHS) 
  It's like, er Do you remember the hitchhiker in Australia? 
  Little Miss Birkenstock. 
  That was something we did together, according to the rules, far from home, on holiday. 
  We did it spontaneously, spur of the moment. 
  - Yeah, but we discussed it. 
  - Briefly. 
  But it was still within the parameters of our agreement, Jeremy. 
  If that still means anything to you Of course, it does. 
  Because the balance of risk has shifted. 
  You're being too reckless. 
  I need you to understand that. 
  To really understand it. 
  The risk to me, to my life, to my career, my liberty. 
  I do. 
  I'm sorry. 
  I love you. 
  I love you, too.

  - So who's Person X? 
  - What? 
  - I'm tired, what does that mean? 
  - (SIGHS) 
  Well, I was handcuffed in the back seat with an itchy wig and nothing to do except chew things over, and it occurred to me that George Cornelius must know you well enough to be acquainted with your weaknesses. 
  - Which are what? 
  - Other people. 
  (LAUGHS) 
  So if I were him, what would I do? 
  I'd say, "Bring me Alice Morgan, or I will do something absolutely dastardly to Person X. 
  " Am I warm? 
  - Toasty. 
  - Mmm. 
  And you actually considered doing it, didn't you? 
  - Yeah. 
  - Giving me to him. 
  Oh, yeah. 
  But you couldn't go through with it. 
  - No. 
  - Why not?

  It's not gonna happen. 
  You do know they won't be so generous? 
  They'll kill you as soon as they look at you. 
  And you are very nice. 
  Alice, I don't care who gets hurt. 
  All right? 
  Knock yourself out, break legs, but no one dies.

  Morning, boss! 
  - I've been trying to get a hold of you. 
  - I bet you have. 
  - Excuse me? 
  - Mmm-hmm. 
  - Do you mind? 
  - HALLIDAY: Sorry? 
  No, not you. 
  Sorry, listen, I've had a bear of a morning. 
  Erm, I've been thinking, whose head was Jeremy Lake looking at on the MRI scan? 
  It feels wrong. 
  - Great minds! 
  I'm on my way to find out now. 
  - JOHN: How? 
  It's not enough for a warrant. 
  HALLIDAY: Er, no worries, erm, I don't need one. 
  Well, don't do anything stupid. 
  Well, no promises, (LAUGHING) 
  but I was actually aiming for the opposite of stupid, so JOHN: All right, you let me know. 
  Oh, will you keep your phone on? 
  Yeah, no, I'll call back as soon as I can. 
  Now, listen, can you (STAMMERS) 
  cover for me? 
  HALLIDAY: Okay, bye. 
  Oh, my God, she's chirpy. 
  Must be insufferable. 
  We need to lay low until this is sorted. 
  Where we can go that's safe? 
  Nowhere where Cornelius can be watching us, which rules out your place or my place.

  Jeremy Lake's office. 
  Hello, can I speak with Dr Lake, please? 
  I'm afraid Mr Lake's not yet in the office. 
  I'm sorry, could you just hold the line for a moment? 
  Hi. 
  Sorry, sorry. 
  I think I left my glasses in here yesterday. 
  They're roundish and tortoise shell. 
  Well, Mr Lake would usually give them to me. 
  He didn't say anything. 
  Oh, right. 
  It's just that I'm pretty sure I had them when I went in there. 
  Do you think I could just have quick squizz around  
  - and I won't break anything. 
  - (MIRIAM SIGHS IMPATIENTLY)

  Please try not to. 
  Thank you.

  MARK: Okay. 
  So you brought the devil around for breakfast. 
  Mark, I need a favour. 
  CELIA: Who did you say these belong to? 
  HALLIDAY: It belongs to a person of interest. 
  CELIA: Which doesn't quite answer the question, does it? 
  HALLIDAY: It doesn't really, does it? 
  What did you think of the cake? 
  Well, whoever it belongs to is very ill. 
  - How ill? 
  - Look. 
  I'd need to confirm it, of course, but this here  
  - Uh-huh? 
  - looks to me like a frontal lobe tumour. 
  Okay. 
  And what are the symptoms of that? 
  (WHIMPERS) 
  Hello, I'm Jeremy. 
  (GASPS AND BEGINS SCREAMING) 
  (MUFFLED SCREAMING AND CRYING) 
  (SOBBING) 
  What are you going to do to me? 
  What do you think? 
  Why? 
  JEREMY: Because I like it. 
  (SOBBING) 
  It's basically all I've ever thought about since I was about yea big. 
  Jeremy. 
  Oh, that's terribly good. 
  I just dangle my name and you swim along and snatch it up. 
  I expect you're trying to humanise yourself. 
  You'll be telling me about your husband next. 
  Your mum and dad, maybe the babies you want to have. 
  (SOBBING) 
  I've got money. 
  I can get you money. 
  JEREMY: No, you can't. 
  I don't need money. 
  What I need right now is to head off to work. 
  And all day, as I'm slicing into people No, don't. 
  Please, don't. 
  - I'll be thinking about  
  - Don't say that. 
  (SOBBING) 
  I'll be thinking about what I want you to do for me. 
  Do you want to know what that is? 
  - Hmm? 
  - No. 
  (SNIFFLES) 
  I don't know. 
  Don't do this, please. 
  (SOBBING) 
  (CLEARS THROAT) 
  There's a phenomenon known as Stockholm syndrome. 
  I expect you've heard of it in a meme or something. 
  So in the spirit of scientific inquiry, I'm going to keep you down here until you fall in love with me. 
  Er, what? 
  I know it sounds difficult to believe at first blush, but it will happen. 
  And in the end What? 
  No. 
  When you've learned not only to love me, but to adore me, when you've cast aside all desire ever to leave me, that's when you get to leave. 
  (SOBBING) 
  When you no longer want to. 
  (CRYING) 
  Right, off to work. 
  Oh, and one more thing. 
  My wife is very jealous. 
  Very possessive. 
  If she finds out I've got, well, a mistress down here, she'll strangle you with your own ovaries. 
  So, quiet as a mouse, eh?

  Okay? 
  (GROANS) 
  (SIGHS) 
  Make yourself at home. 
  ALICE: Oh, you're very nice. 
  Er, do you have any bacon? 
  MARK: I've been a vegetarian since I was 17. 
  (SIGHS) 
  Of course you have. 
  (REFRIGERATOR DOOR CLOSES) 
  So the last I heard you were Well, quite, but apparently only the good die young. 
  MARK: Well, then, congratulations. 
  - (ORANGE JUICE POURING) 
  - You can expect to live forever. 
  Well, I'm certainly gonna give it a whirl. 
  - (CHUCKLES) 
  - (DOOR SLAMS) 
  Mark, I'm really sorry to do this to you. 
  My wife's at work. 
  You need to be done by the time she gets back. 
  She won't even know we're here. 
  Just do what you need to do and move on. 
  Don't drink all the orange juice. 
  And don't get blood on the sofa. 
  (SIGHS DEEPLY) 
  Massey, stop by the gate. 
  You looking for business, darling? 
  (SIGHS) 
  You know, the last time we had a chat like this off the record, on the QT, I swear you were wearing flares. 
  And you were wearing a sheepskin coat and a pair of Foster Grants. 
  So what were you doing there, George, mop-handed at a copper's house? 
  A police officer? 
  One of your own. 
  Tell me. 
  What did he do, rob a bank? 
  Possibly. 
  I don't care. 
  Oh. 
  Well, you make me nostalgic for the dead days, Martin, time was you'd have dragged me out of this motor and beaten my tripes out with a pickaxe handle. 
  As you say, dead days. 
  Well, you tell that to your lad. 
  He's bent as a pin. 
  I met his lady friend. 
  God above. 
  Well, I can't answer those questions, George, without knowing precisely the nature of your allegation. 
  And of the many crimes I know you've committed down the years, being a snitch was never one of them. 
  Now, I don't know what's going on between you and Luther, but you need to stay away from my officer, George. 
  Or I'll have you. 
  Yeah, yeah, yeah. 
  (WOMAN TALKING INDISTINCTLY ON TV) 
  Have you managed to get a hold of Errol? 
  BENNY: No. 
  It's going to be okay. 
  There's no way Cornelius is sending his boys to your flat. 
  And to be fair, that's easy for you to say. 
  You haven't spent half the morning spitting your teeth out. 
  Benny, I'm going to put this right. 
  Okay, I'm I'm going to make it right by you, mate. 
  How? 
  This isn't the militant wing of the National Trust we're dealing with here. 
  It's George Cornelius. 
  You don't go up against him. 
  You know, I always thought she'd be the end of you. 
  I didn't think she'd be the end of us all. 
  Yeah, well, Benny (INHALES SHARPLY) 
  It's going to get worse. 
  A lot worse. 
  There's something Cornelius doesn't know yet. 
  Shift's over, Donnie. 
  Go home and get some kip. 
  Cheers, George. 
  (CORNELIUS CLEARS HIS THROAT) 
  CORNELIUS: His Nibs all right up there? 
  DONNIE: Fine. 
  I haven't heard a peep since, er  
  CORNELIUS: Since what? 
  DONNIE: The present. 
  The what? 
  The welcome-home present you asked for. 
  No.

  Mmm. 
  (LINE RINGING) 
  (MOBILE RINGING AND BUZZING) 
  (GROANS) 
  - Yes? 
  - CORNELIUS: (ON PHONE) 
  Mr Palmer, we spoke once before. 
  Just convenience, that's all. 
  What are you doing? 
  Work. 
  - (LINE RINGING) 
  - Can't avoid it. 
  John. 
  What am I avoiding? 
  - Yes, Halliday, how'd you get on? 
  - (ON PHONE) 
  Er, pretty good, I think. 
  Well, enough to be confident that James Hauser didn't kill anyone. 
  Er, boss? 
  - You there? 
  Erm - Yeah, yeah. 
  Yeah, I'm here. 
  Go on. 
  HALLIDAY: Okay, so I was looking through the file last night and I saw something. 
  Just a small thing, really, but on the back of it I got some analysis done. 
  A CCTV image of the killer and one of James Hauser. 
  And they're stood next to what turned out to be identical lampposts. 
  It's two men. 
  Similar heights, but not identical. 
  Well, yeah, that doesn't mean Hauser wasn't good for any of it. 
  I had this thing once, it was two brothers Er, I think this is a whole different thing. 
  I was talking to Celia yesterday at the autopsy, and she was talking about what it takes to slice your own throat without hesitation. 
  Now, yes, James Hauser was into self-mutilation, but with pins and needles. 
  He liked insertion. 
  But slicing your own throat with a scalpel, that's a whole different proposition. 
  Now, who uses a scalpel? 
  And who's in a position to manipulate James, to put him exactly where they want him to be? 
  Now I think he was a patsy, and I think they've set him up to look responsible for the crimes committed by Jeremy Lake. 
  And the MRI scan. 
  Now, I think Jeremy was looking at his own head. 
  Because whoever it is has a non-operable tumour on his frontal lobe. 
  And now, if it is him, it could be affecting his His behaviour, his judgment, disinhibiting him. 
  DCI Luther? 
  Yeah. 
  John, we've got a missing person. 
  Penny Leyton. 
  Her partner came home from work last night and declared her missing. 
  Yeah, the local police have accessed some CCTV footage. 
  I'm sending it through to you now. 
  I'll meet you as the hospital. 
  All right. 
  Yeah, I'm Yeah, I'm coming.

  - You have to be joking. 
  - (SIGHS) 
  There's a woman missing. 
  So? 
  So I knew who took her. 
  - ALICE: She's not your responsibility  
  - She is my responsibility. 
  - We are. 
  - I knew, Alice. 
  I looked this prick in the eyes and I What, how? 
  Did he forget to yawn? 
  - I let him go because I was  
  - Of me? 
  Well, I'm flattered. 
  But I do hope you remember that if it weren't for me, you'd be dead or in prison. 
  Either way, you wouldn't be galloping to anyone's rescue. 
  - I can't let this go. 
  I just can't. 
  - You have to, John. 
  - George Cornelius is  
  - I can handle George Cornelius. 
  No, you can't, John. 
  Not in the way you'd like to. 
  We're past that.

  - George. 
  I'm sorry it's come to this, but we are where we are. 
  Now, you have two options, you bring it back from the brink, or  
  - Or what? 
  - JOHN: I take you down. 
  I take you, your family, everything. 
  Brick by brick. 
  You'll be the king of a smoking hill, mate. 
  - You understand? 
  - My son is dead, John. 
  I know. 
  I know and it shouldn't have happened, but it did. 
  Now take a step back. 
  Don't make me go to war. 
  You should have lied, arranged a meeting. 
  No. 
  No point lying to him. 
  He'd have known. 
  Confirm transfer.

  (SIGHS) 
  I had to try. 
  I know.

  - No. 
  I have to end it. 
  Yes. 
  Now.

  - John, you can't  
  - Take it, leave it. 
  I don't care, Alice. 
  Tonight, then. 
  Tonight. 
  Do you know how? 
  I do know how. 
  - For what it's worth, I am sorry. 
  - No, you're not. 
  Give this to Benny and don't let Mark see it. 
  I'm not apologising for what's happened, I'm regretting what's to come.

  Jeremy Lake left before we arrived, but his car is still here. 
  I should have nicked him when I had the chance. 
  SCHENK: There were no grounds. 
  - I should have made grounds. 
  - SCHENK: So, what made him run? 
  Sir, I was here earlier today. 
  Erm, yeah, maybe that spooked him. 
  You were here earlier? 
  Doing what? 
  JOHN: Nothing, really. 
  Erm, I asked DS Halliday to interview the secretary before he came into work. 
  I mean, that couldn't have spooked him. 
  That was hours ago. 
  SCHENK: So why did he run? 
  What does he know and how does he know it? 
  See, I don't think that is the question that's going to find him. 
  (WOMAN TALKING INDISTINCTLY) 
  SCHENK: Then I'd like to know what is. 
  It's what she knows. 
  Vivien Lake. 
  JOHN: I don't think that Vivien is his accomplice. 
  I think she cleans up for him and she hates him for it. 
  So does that mean Vivien doesn't know about Penny Leyton? 
  Let's find out.

  You You led your life in fear of him, okay? 
  So, (SIGHS) 
  Help me to find him. 
  I will help you, I promise you that. 
  I think you're in need of psychiatric assistance, Officer. 
  (INDISTINCT CHATTERING ON POLICE RADIO)

  John, I need you to come back here. 
  Er, mate, I promise, as soon as I can, I will, okay? 
  No, right now. 
  - I've got big problems, Mark. 
  - Well, I have a big problem here. 
  JOHN: (ON PHONE) 
  Yeah, what? 
  John, my girlfriend is on her way home, I need you to get your friends out of here. 
  Er, Mark, listen, I'm at the office, okay? 
  Erm, can you I can't get out of that now. 
  Can I can I come back to you on this? 
  (MOUTHING INAUDIBLY) 
  When is that? 
  JOHN: I don't know, Mark. 
  Two, three hours? 
  No, that's no good, John. 
  Remember what she told you. 
  If she sees you and Alice around here JOHN: Oh, yeah, okay. 
  Erm, I'm about to step into an autopsy, all right? 
  Can you give me two hours? 
  Can you do that? 
  John. 
  Yeah? 
  (ON PHONE) 
  Mark tried, but he oversold the lies. 
  But at least this way we know where we stand. 
  I have a message for you from Mr Cornelius. 
  I think I've got the message. 
  Hmm. 
  I'm going to need you here, John. 
  Why, so you can kill everyone? 
  Not everyone. 
  Just you and Alice. 
  Assuming you listen and do as I ask. 
  Er, he's lying, John. 
  Er, oh JOHN: Listen to me, all right? 
  I'll go to Cornelius. 
  I'll go to Cornelius right now. 
  I'll hand myself in, all right? 
  You can do what you want to Alice, but you leave Benny and Mark alone. 
  Do you understand me? 
  PALMER: John, I need you to focus. 
  You're not in control here. 
  This isn't a situation you can leverage. 
  Listen to me, you piece of sh1t! 
  If you hurt them, I swear to God I will rip your f*cking heart out. 
  Do you understand me? 
  I'm not here to listen. 
  This isn't a dialogue. 
  And now your friend is dead. 
  John. 
  Mark. 
  Just stop. 
  Just stop right now. 
  Leave him be. 
  None of this is his fault. 
  Benny, right? 
  That's right. 
  You're killing yourself, Benny. 
  Benny? 
  Benny? 
  Don't you f*ck Don't you say another word, Benny.
