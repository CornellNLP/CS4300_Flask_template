 Cheers. 
 See you later, mate. 
 How you doing in there? 
 I'll be fine. Did they go? 
 Mmm-hmm, all gone. 
 (WHISPERS) I had to. 
 James : Mmm. 
 You sure you've got the passports? 
 I've got the passports. 
 (BOTH CHUCKLE) 
 Show me the passports. 
 Jessica : Oh! 
 (LORRY HORN HON KS) 
 I don't believe it. 
 Did you give them a tip? 
 Yeah, I gave them a tip. 
 No, this is a different lot. 
 (INTERCOM BUZZING) 
 (HUFFS) 
 Sure. 
 (GRUNTS) 
 (SCREAMS) 
 On the floor! Floor now! 
 Evangeline : Shut up! I said shut up. 
 (JESSICA SCREAMS) 
 Don't move. 
 (JESSICA SOBS) 
 (IN AMERICAN ACCENT) James Carrodus. 
 Dealer of fine art. 
 Quite the reputation, but not above the odd privately brokered deal, selling fakes to Russian billionaires who don't know any better, huh? 
 And this cash, James, was liquefied in the form of 18 cut diamonds of outstanding quality. 
 'Cause that's the best way to carry serious wealth, am I right? 
 Now you're off to start a new life in Rio with your beautiful bride, Jessica. 
 The limousine arrives in, what, James? 15 minutes? 
 Ten. 
 Ten. 
 In 10 minutes, you could both be in that limo. 
 All I need you to do is give me those diamonds. 
 I don't have them. 
 Okay. 
 Okay. 
 There's nothing. 
 (SIGHS) 
 You go get me those diamonds, James. 
 In two hours. Let's call at 10:15. 
 I've got those 18 diamonds in my hand or we start cutting the lovely Jessica here. 
 All right. All right. 
 At this point, I'm sure you're asking yourself, "Is he bluffing?" 
 I know you'll appreciate, that it's in my best interest to prove that I'm not. 
 Apologies in advance, Jessica. 
 You don't... You don't have to do this. 
 Jessica : No, no, no. No, please! 
 Look you don't have to... 
 I'll get you the... 
 Jessica : No! (SCREAMS)

 Guv. 
 Guv. 
 Justin. 
 Hello, sir. Can I help? 
 Ian Reed? 
 I need to see Ian Reed. 
 Er, I'm afraid DCI Reed is elsewhere. 
 I'm DCI John Luther. 
 I share an office with Mr Reed. 
 This is DS Ripley. Can I help you? Come on. 
 It's her tongue. 
 You sure you want to play it this way, Dan? It's pretty hardcore. 
 The police, they get involved. Kidnap, it's going to be. 
 Did you just use my name in front of the victim, Tom? 
 (CHAIN JANGLES) 
 James, the fact of it is most kidnappings don't come to our attention because when it comes to family members, people pay up pretty fast. 
 You think I don't want to do that? 
 You think I don't want to give them what they asked for and get my wife back? 
 Do you think that? 
 James, I just need to understand what's happening. 
 I came to see you because I haven't got what they want. 
 And I've no way of getting it. 
 What are you saying? 
 Jessica swallowed them. 
 The diamonds are inside her right now. 
 If I'd have told them that, they'd have cut her open on the spot. 
 Sorry. 
 Oh, yeah, well, that's, er, Bill Winingham. 
 He sent Carrodus directly to you. 
 Oh, yeah? 
 How well do you know him? 
 Yeah, pretty well. He's a money launderer, basically. 
 Bit of a gent, as it goes. 
 Never involved in any bloodshed, not to my knowledge. 
 Right, thing is, he was the one that procured the diamonds for Carrodus in the first place and he's the only third party to know that they even exist. 
 So if anyone set this up, I think he's our man. 
 Turns out, no one's seen Winingham for three or four days. 
 So we can't find our sole lead? 
 No. And the kidnappers want their ransom in just over an hour. 
 You think they'll make good on their threat? 
 Absolutely. 
 Um, listen, Bill knows me, so do his friends and family. 
 Do you want me to go out there, see if I can round him up, find out what the hell's going on? 
 Yeah, see if you can do that. 
 So, they won't give us what we want. 
 We can't give them what they want. 
 No, we can't give it to them, but we can lend it to them. 
 Meaning? 
 Let's visit the evidence safe. 
 Don't want to hear it. 
 Boss, these are very special circumstances. 
 Same rules do not apply. 
 Chain of evidence is like the Ten Commandments. 
 It applies unto time and all eternal. 
 Anything in the evidence safe is sacrosanct. 
 We tamper, we risk voiding active cases. 
 Only if we get found out. 
 Am I actually having this conversation? 
 Are you actually saying this to me? 
 Boss, listen. 
 Listen to me carefully. If we do not have any security to play with, then Jessica dies. 
 If I start stealing evidence... 
 Borrowing. 
 If I start borrowing evidence to use for my own purposes... 
 It won't be out of my sight for a second. 
 (SIGHS) 
 (SAFE LOCK BEEPS) 
 Of course I understand. He's your husband. 
 Oh, no. He's not. 
 Let me say it. Let me get it out. 
 And then it's said. It's said and done. 
 I don't want to ever have this conversation again. 
 I'm gonna go away for a couple of days and give you time to think. 
 There's nothing to think about. 
 Yes, there is. 
 And if you decide to stay with me, there'll be no recrimination, no blame, no nothing. 
 We pick up where we left off, and we carry on. 
 But? 
 But, you can never see him again. 
 Not ever. That means no phone calls, no emails, no nothing. 
 It's necessary for me. 
 I can't let you do this to me again. I can't. 
 (MOBILE PHONE RINGS) 
 Babe. 
 Zoe :  John. 
 Can I see you? 
 Absolutely. Erm... 
 I just got a lot of stuff going on here. Can I call you later? Okay, but I really need to see you. It needs to be today. No, me too. All right? Erm, I'll call you the moment I get a chance. All right. How much are these worth? I don't know, about £3.5 million. I appreciate the effort, but these people want something very specific. They want 18 diamonds of a particular size, quality and value. That's the best we can do. It's not what they want. James, I'm gonna need you to understand that unless we find a way to open up lines of communication with the kidnappers, they're going to kill Jessica. Not tomorrow or the next day, but before this hand gets here. So you will deliver these diamonds. But you'll attach a note that says, "Give me Jessica and you'll get the rest." They won't go for it. No, they won't go for it. But we'll have given them a good enough reason to keep Jessica alive a little longer (SIGHS) and we will have made our first contact. Once we can achieve that then we can think about the next stage. Hmm. Ian. It's not my fault! It's not my fault. Look, we all know the rules, all right? You rob a thief of stolen money, he thinks of that as cost of business. He's not going to the police, nobody gets hurt, no innocents are involved. And that's the way these things have worked since I was a woodentop. Now this is kidnapping, Bill. They took his wife. They cut out her tongue. Oh, sweet Mary. So what happened? I don't know. All I know is that they're supposed to call with the all-clear, but I've heard nothing. Where are they now? I don't know. No, that's not good enough. Okay, you need to listen to me, all right? You need to forget about the money. The money's gone. The money doesn't matter. You need to tell me what you know. Who did your nephew recruit for the job? Some... Some American he hooked up with over there when he was at school. He's a bright boy. He's a clever boy. Some American? That's it? I don't know where they are! Bill, they are going to kill her. Oh, Jesus. Okay? And I can't be responsible for her death. Not because the chance to make a few easy quid went wrong. So I have to make sure she gets through this. Do you understand me? Whatever it takes, I have to get her through this. Of course. (MOBILE PHONE RINGS) Do you have it? Yes. All right, Westfield Shopping Centre. Central Hall. 20 minutes. 20 minutes, er... I don't think I can make it. I need... (PHONE LINE GOES DEAD) Rose : Entrances and exits covered. Man :  Received. Rose :  Echo 1 in position. Echo 2 in position. Man 2 :  Affirmed. Rose : Carrodus coming into position. John : Eyeball on Carrodus. Benny : Okay. Here we go, people. What... What's this? John : Couple of hoodies. Rose : Subject's been handed something. John :  It's a note. Instructions. John :  Pick 'em up, Ripley. Justin :  Yeah, I'm there. All right. Rose :  John, stay on Carrodus. I'm gonna move then. Rose : Visual on the coffee bar. Benny : Nope. No visual. (ROSE SIGHS) Thank you very much. John :  Diamonds are in the bag. Rose : Received. Benny, track the hoodies. Tracking. Ah! Are you getting this, Benny? A wasp in a wheelie bin. Yeah. Have uniform pick 'em up, they're no kidnappers. Just kids that'll have been given money to give Carrodus that note. Well, go. John :  Eyeball on Carrodus. Level 2. John :  What's he waiting for? I'm watching. Benny, what's he doing? I don't know. But we don't like it. Benny : He's made his drop. Yeah. Rose : Cover all second-floor stairs and escalators. Okay, I've got an eyeball. Two live ones. One male, one female. Here we go, here we go. Justin :  Subjects approaching drop point. They have the bag. Son of a bitch! What's wrong? She's not happy. Something's wrong. I don't know. Get in closer, can you? No diamonds. What do you mean, no diamonds? I mean, run the b*st*rd down. Go! Go! Justin, if she makes that call, Jessica's dead! (EVANGELINE GRUNTS) Don't lose him. Hey! Hey! (PANTING) You're under arrest for the kidnapping of Jessica Carrodus. You do not have to say anything. Benny, Benny, come on. Boss, come on. John, I've lost him. I'm sorry. We've lost him? We've lost him. (SIGHS) Oh, sh1t. (MOBILE PHONE RINGS) Listen, I don't know who you are or where you are. You're still in control here, so don't put the phone down. Prolong the situation. Ensure the safety of the hostages. Foster relationship between negotiator and hostage-taker. But most importantly, keep things calm. Look, I know you're no amateur. All right? So I'm not going to try and play you here. Yeah, I will try and trace the call, but it's gonna take me a couple of minutes to get in motion. By the time I do that, you'll be long gone. You've got one minute. Carrodus kept the ransom. He did, huh? Last-minute calculation. The way he sees it, Jessica was going to die even if he gave you the money, so why give you the money? Looks like we both lost him, right? Look, I don't care about him. I want Jessica back. That's all we want. No, it's not. No, you want to arrest me and send me to prison. Yeah, I do want that. But that's not an outcome I can expect, not right now, not given the circumstances. So I'm going to go for plan B, right, which is get Jessica back alive. What's your name? John. But don't doubt that I can get you what you want. I just... just give me three hours. I tell you what, you give me a number and I'll call you on it in one hour. I'll need proof of life. You won't get it, John. You see, this is a game of trust now, John. Do you think you can manage that? (SIGHS DEEPLY) All right, take this number down. Uncle Bill, it's gone bad. What do you mean? There's no ransom. There's hot and cold running police. sh1t. What? They've nicked Evie. Daniel's lost it. If I go back to him empty-handed, no diamonds, no Evie, right, that's it. That's it. I've had it, I've had it. Tom, I've got somebody here that needs to talk to you. Jesus, Bill, who've you got there? Don't panic. He's a friend, all right? He's a friend. Who's there? Okay, Tom. You need to listen to me now. Okay? Are you listening? Who are you? Are you listening? Yes, yes! I'm listening. Where are they keeping her? I'm not going to tell you that, am I? Okay, Tom, you can still get out of this, with the money, do you understand me? No, no, look, I'm sorry, no, I don't. I don't understand, I don't get it. The woman, okay, the woman, Jessica Carrodus. She has the diamonds. Just get her away from wherever she's being kept. Get her away safely and you can have it all. I can't! If you don't do this... If you don't do this, hand to God, I'll kill you myself. Rose : Anything? Not a word. No prints on record. No nothing. You know, she may not have been our problem up until now, but she'll have been someone's. You don't start off at kidnapping. You work your way up to it. Why don't you send her details to Detective Munch in New York. He's Special Victims Unit there. Sir. "The evidence won't leave our sight for a second"? We'll get it back. We'd better, because right this second, I'm peddling thin air like Wile E. Coyote. I'm sorry. Can I get five minutes? You can have two. How are you? Good? Nice to see you. Bye-bye, then. (SCOFFS) Hello. Hello. I haven't seen you in here forever. I know, it was a long time back. I need a moment. I can't. It's a madhouse today. Can I see you later? Not really. Are you really going to do this to me today? In front of everyone? (ZOE SIGHS) I can't make a scene, yeah? (ZOE SCOFFS) 'Cause you're safer here. (JOHN SIGHS) What do you want me to do? Beg you? 'Cause I've done that. I don't want that. I don't want that. You want... You want me to ask you why? You already know why. Zoe, you say that. And I... I don't. I mean I think about it and then... (SIGHS) I really do think and just nothing. I don't know why you keep doing this to me. You and me, these last few days, it's just been... It's just been a way of saying goodbye properly. And I think we both knew that deep down. We knew it, didn't we? (WHISPERING) Zoe. I didn't know. (SIGHS) Do you know who she is? Do you have any clue what she might be going through right now? Where she is? Do you want to see her tongue? 'Cause I have it somewhere here in a napkin. Get out. John... Get out! Get out! Get out! (SIGHS) (GRUNTS) Oh! Whoa! All right, back to work! The clock is ticking! (BREATHES HEAVILY) (FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING) John : Did you speak to Munch? Er, yeah. Evangeline Nixon. Long history of violence, extortion, suspected kidnap. Married to this man, Daniel Sugarman, 36. Even longer history. Armed robbery, extortion, kidnap. More than one murder. Yeah, that's him. No facial tattoo. No, I bet it's fake. Just look at his face. That's all you're going to remember. When's he due to call? In about four minutes. Oi, Winingham? No sign of him. All right. All right. (JOHN CLEARS THROAT) (MOBILE PHONE RINGS) All right. I'm here. Do you have it? Most of it. Most of it is not what we agreed, John. Deal's off. What about Jessica? You have to get this into your head, all right? I don't care about her. If I no longer believe her to be of sufficient value to you, then her value to me diminishes sharply. Do you understand? And right now, it seems to me that she's verging on worthless. Well, okay, we've got Evangeline. I mean, what's her value? To you, Evie 's an asset of very limited benefit. I know she 's safe. I know you can't hurt her. I know she's strong and won't say a damn word about me. So keep her. She's not in play here. She’s just a captured piece. You bring me the money. Last chance. All right, okay, I can get £3 or £4 million. But it's going to take some time. You have one hour. Plus, here's a revised deal. You give me 100% of what I want, you get back 100% of Jessica. You bring me 80% of what I want, you get 80% of Jessica. And so on. You take longer than an hour, you don't get to know how she died or where I dumped her. All right, how long? Two to three minutes. Make it two minutes. (JESSICA GROANS) Shh! Shh! Please, Jessica. Hey, I'm trying to get you out of here, all right? I'm trying to get you home. (JESSICA GROANS) Please. I know they're inside of you. If you do not let me help you, he's gonna cut them out. So, please, please help me here. Thank you. (DOOR CLOSES) (SIGHS) We offered Daniel a swap. You for Jessica. Do you want to know what he said? John :  We've got Evangeline, I mean, what's her value? Daniel :  You have to get this in your head, all right. I don't care about her. I no longer believe her to be of sufficient value. Right now it seems to me that she's verging on worthless. So keep her. You bring me the money. Now, I neither have the patience or the time to feel sorry for you, so this is a one-time offer. You tell me where Daniel's staying and I'll make sure you're looked after. You've got 10 seconds. Then after that, I walk out of that door and you never see me again. I want to serve my time in the States. I can arrange that. (JESSICA GROANS) (MOBILE PHONE BEEPING) That was the burn code. That means he's on his way. (MUFFLED URGING) That worked. So what now? Jessica's being held alone, at worst being guarded by a third kidnapper, Tom Meyer. Come on! Get down. (ENGINE REVS) Come on! Come on! Almost there. (JESSICA GROANS) sh1t! (PANTING) (ENGINE REVVING) (THUDDING) (POLICE SIRENS BLARING) 
 
 (CAMERA CLICKING) You okay? No, I'm not. Are you? No. John : Yeah, it should be. (SIGHS) What a God Almighty mess this is. Have we, um, put it together? Well, best guess? Jessica sees Meyer as a nice guy. You know, her best way out of here. Classic Stockholm response. So she tells him about the diamonds. Meyer decides to rescue her, maybe keep the diamonds for himself. Then, just as they're leaving, Sugarman comes back. He turns on Meyer. Tortures him until he gives up what's happening. So the only possible link to all this is the money launderer, Bill what's-his-name? Winingham. So, track him down. Throw accessory to multiple murder, kidnap, extortion. In the face of that, he'll give it up in five minutes. Mate? You all right? Yeah, yeah, yeah. I'm fine. It's just, er, what a mess, eh? (SCOFFS) Yeah. Erm, so, listen, do you want me to, erm, track down Winingham? Yes. And I'll go for Sugarman. He'll have vanished, John. You know that, he'll be gone. No, he won't. No, he knows we'll be watching the airports and the ports. He'll probably go underground somewhere, lay low. Are you sure you're all right? Yeah, yeah, I'm fine. You don't look it. No. No. Bad day. Bad, bad day. Your nephew's dead. (GASPS) Sugarman cut off his fingers and his ear. Oh! And then they gutted Jessica and they took what was inside her. (GAGGING) (VOMITING) Do you understand what I'm saying? Tom only did what he did because I told him to. If I'd said nothing, my friends would've got there in time. They'd have got to Jessica. Tom would still be alive. I made a really bad mistake, Bill. I made a really, really bad mistake. That's all right, son. You didn't mean to, Ian. I know you didn't mean to. Okay. All right, so I... I need you to concentrate, okay? I need you to concentrate because I have to start trying to clear up this mess, all right? Does Daniel Sugarman know about me? He asked if anyone else knew and I told him no. He knew I was lying. It's okay. It's okay. That's okay. You know what? I know you had no choice. I know you had no choice. (BILL CRYING) What did you tell him? I told him I knew a copper who could smooth things over for us if we needed. As long as nobody gets hurt. I told him, I said... I said, "That is a deal-breaker." No violence, no bloodshed. Did you give him my name? No, I wouldn't do that. Is there anything he asked you to do, anything that might help me find him before my friends do? I don't know. (SNIFFLES) He said something about passports and I told him to get in touch with Patrick Holguin. That's good, Bill. That's really, really good. That might help us. Will you be okay? Oh, Bill, this is not about me. I'm nothing. Jessica Carrodus is dead, and I'm gonna have to try and live with that somehow. But you've gotta understand that this has grown. And if I go to prison for this, then every case that I've ever convicted will be questioned. (SNIFFLES) And all the murderers, the rapists, the predators, they might get out. They might be back on the street. And whatever they do after that, whoever they hurt... ...that'll be my fault. And I can't live with that. I can't. I just... I just can't. I'm sorry, son. Do you want a drink? Yeah. I'm so sorry, son. Me, too. (BILL SNIFFLES) (GLASS ES BREAKING) (BILL GAGGING) John : Thanks for coming. How could I not? You sounded... This is such an interesting place. John Milton was buried here. You know Paradise Lost? Mmm. Very well. He wrote it to justify the ways of God to men. But even he couldn't do that. God emerged as a tyrant. Satan as a hero. (CHUCKLES) Where is this leading? All those things you said to me about Zoe, about me, about us, about all of us. You were right. There is no love, not really, you know? Most of its just cruel and deceitful, just matter. I saw a lot of matter today. (SIGHS) Matter all over the place. There is nothing. There's absolutely nothing. You know you hurt me very badly. Don't. Okay? No games. No games. Listen. I did what I did to Henry Madsen because I wanted to help you. I put my liberty at risk because I couldn't... (SIGHS) ...bear to see you hurt. So what I did, I did for... ...wholly unselfish reasons. I don't... Yes, you do. "The mind is its own place, and in itself can make a heaven of hell, a hell of heaven." The universe isn't evil, John. It's just indifferent. That hasn't changed. It can't. But what I did for you proved something to me. Something I hadn't... ...believed... ...until that moment. What? It's you who's right. There is love in the world. (SIGHS) Thank you. Thank you. Any progress on Carrodus? No activity on the credit cards or the mobile. Right now I need to see Evangeline's stuff. It's fake. Em, how quickly can we find out who made this? Batches of forged passports tend to have defects specific to the forger, so Benny should be able to identify it pretty quickly. All right, cool. Do you want me to come with? No. Stay here. Stay on Carrodus. Oh, get the diamonds back in the evidence room, save the Duchess's sanity. If I get a line on Sugarman, I'll call you. Patrick, yeah? Yeah. Can you make me a passport? A good one? Best you'll get. Yeah? (BOTH GRUNTING) (PANTING) There, you see that? Oh, no, not again. All right, now I don't have much time, so I'm not going to drag this out. How many fingers do I have to break before I... He's staying at The Renaissance. The big hotel. How do you know that? He wanted a total of nine passports for three people. So? So nobody buys in that volume, except terrorists and whatever. (PANTING) They have a lot of aircrews at The Renaissance and I thought, I don't want anything to do with any of that, thank you very much. So then what? So I followed him. What? You were going to make him pay for the passports, then grass him up? Too right. I've got to live in this city, you know. I've got family. (JOHN CHUCKLES) Not even forgers are honest these days. Go on, get out of here. Wait a second. What did you mean, "not again"? (MOBILE PHONE RINGS) Hey, John. What's up? John :  Ian. Don't do it. Don't do what? I know what you're about to do. And what am I about to do? John :  Look, I saw your face at the crime scene, all right? I know it did something to you. I know how that feels. But if you hurt Sugarman, you'll go down for it. All right? It'll finish you. Who says I'm going to hurt Sugarman? I spoke to the passport forger. I know you're looking for him. So? So, look, if you want two minutes with him alone, break his legs, whatever, but just let me be there to tell you when to stop, mate. All right. Okay, listen, let's meet at The Fountain. John :  Fountain, yeah, all right. Erm, I can be there at 3:00? All. right, but just you. Not Teller. Not Ripley. Just me and you, okay? Yeah, yeah, yeah. Just me and you. No Ripley, no Teller. All right, 3:00 at The Fountain. Okay, bye. (SIGHS) You're not going to be at The Fountain, are you, Ian? (DRAMATIC INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC) Excuse me, no time to bullshit. Is this man here? Erm... Oh, you lying b*st*rd, John. You lying b*st*rd. Which room? (LOADS GUN) (LOCK BEEPS) (CLATTERING) (BOTH GRUNTING) John : Listen! Listen to me, listen to me, listen to me, listen to me! Listen, someone's coming here for you, okay? He's coming. He'll be here very soon if he isn't here already. Now, ordinarily, I'd let him do whatever he wants to you, but he's my mate, okay, and I don't want to see him go to prison, so if you want to live, Daniel, I need you to listen to me. Come with me. Whoa! Ian, Ian, Ian. Ian. Ian, listen! (COCKS GUN) If you kill this man, that's it for you, you know that, right? What are you going to do, John? Arrest me? No! That's not what I mean and you know that. No, I've known you too long, mate. I know how your mind works. Ian, this is not a play. All right? This is not a tactic. Do you have any idea of the lies I've told for you over the years, for all the sh1t you've done? Yeah, well I've never killed anyone, have I? Yeah. Not for lack of trying. And it was you, Ian, that stopped me every single time. So here I am, all right, returning the favour. Don't do it. No matter how much he's earned it. It's not worth it. Hold on... What did this turd say to you? What? What did he say about me? What do you mean? (YELLING) What did he say? What? Daniel : Now it makes sense. You must be... Shut up. sh1t. Whatever. John : Oh! What did he say? I don't know what you mean. What did he say? I don't know what you mean, Ian! I don't know what you mean, all right? Help me here, I'm lost. I'm just lost. Whatever this is... Whatever this is, all right, we can make it go away. I was here to make an arrest. Sugarman was armed, all right? You thought my life was in imminent danger and you took appropriate action. Don't say that. Why? Because you don't know what I've done. I do know what you've done and I don't care about it, mate. He is nothing! No, not him. He's nothing. What? Look, I knew about the robbery, all right? You... You what? Yeah, I let it go ahead for a percentage. And that's why I'm here. Not for revenge, but to shut him up. Now, still want to help me? Still want to make it go away? Did you know about the kidnapping? No. All right, well, then, good, 'cause I don't care. We can still make this work. I didn't want any of this, John. You know that. I tried to make it right. I wanted it to be right. I know. All right. I know. How can I believe you? You know how much I want to. (YELLING) Because you know when I'm lying.

(GROANS) (GROANS) Put these away in the safe, would you? Ah. Hello, sir. You were going to value some diamonds for me. Jeweller : Yes, erm... They're fakes, James. They're good fakes, but they're fakes. Evidence in a fraud trial. Best we could do at short notice. Jessica? Thanks. Mark :  Hi, it's me. I'm not going to stay at Heather and Allan's. It's silly.

It's complicated. And it's my house. So what's going on? Okay. You, er... You ever have one of those days you wish it would end, but somehow it never does? More than my share. Well, that day's today. Cheers. And if you do this for me, all right, you're going to help end it, so please... Please, will you just call John? I can't. Why not? Because, actually, you're scaring me. Look, I don't mean to, I don't mean to. You know me and John are friends, right? Well, so call him yourself. I can't. I can't. I just can't. It's just things have got really complicated. Look, Ian, I can see things aren't right, that you're in trouble. All I can do is tell you to trust him because he's your friend and that means a great deal to him, but I can't call him up and lie to him and pretend you're not here. I can't do that. You have to. No, I don't! Just do it. Just get your phone. Zoe, please. Please get your phone. I don't want to hurt you. That's not what I'm here for. I just need you to call John, all right, and ask him over. And when he comes, will you be pointing that thing at him? Yeah. I might have to. just for a bit. Just so I can sit him down and make him hear what I've got to say. All I want is to trust him. And if I don't? (GASPS) Don't make me answer that question, please. Look at me. Hear what I've got to say. Don't make me answer that question. Ian, please don't. Just do it!
