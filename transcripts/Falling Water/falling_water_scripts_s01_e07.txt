 Previously on "Falling Water"... 
 You promised me answers. 
 I promised to help you reach your mother. 
 You don't know anything about my mother. Wake up! I had a good time the other night. The octopus was great. I just want to know about my son. Where is he? What's his name? What the hell is this? That's a picture of my son. Tell me about the boy in the flyer. I'm staring at a whole bag of them. What do you dream about? Woody. We have this passionate love affair. I think Woody's invading your dreams. [grunts] I know you think you're in control of things, but you're not. The people holding her are the ones with the green sneakers. They want to unleash the same kind of anarchy on humanity that your dreams unleashed on you. [typewriter keys clacking] Hobbes, Locke, Rousseau: Three white men trying to explain what holds civilization together. Is it the social contract? The enlightened mind? Or mutually assured destruction? Personally, I keep hoping for a fourth option. Something full of magic. Dreams have always been at the center of our lives. Right now, upstate, there's a cult that believes that we can enter each other's minds through our dreams. Part of me wants to join just for the experience. Sounds like your next piece for "The New Yorker." Mm. Well, hopefully it sounds like a book. I have a proposal on submission at Scribner. Can I read it? It's just a sample chapter and an outline. My plan is to get more information on the cult, make that the centerpiece. Well, when you're ready for readers, I'd love to see it. [dramatic music] [dark music] ♪ ♪ [dramatic music] ♪ ♪ [horn honking] ♪ ♪ I need to talk to you. ♪ ♪ [sighs] I think Nicholas knows. About Woody. About your dreams? About the affair. It... [sighs] He has the housekeeper following me like she's a spy, like... like she'll get a bonus if she catches me at something. Elizabeth, look at me. Hey. Look at me. Are you awake? Yes. And your affair... it's only in your dreams? I don't know. It's so confusing. I... Nicholas is gonna kill me. Mr. Hull's not the type. Oh, yes, he is. Trust me. You haven't done anything wrong. I screwed another man. In your dreams. It's the same thing. You know it's the same thing. I know how you feel. But you have the power to make yourself right. ♪ ♪ It's a beautiful day. ♪ ♪ Here you go. Thanks. Thank you. How is that breakfast? Still better than the goat milk Wheatina they served at Aeskyton. [chuckles] [sighs] We're lucky we didn't all starve. [solemn music] I've been thinking about it a lot. All the people who came and went. Yeah, it was never lonely. Mm. ♪ ♪ Are you doing okay? ♪ ♪ It's just you calling me out of the blue after... [sighs] Seven years? 6 1/2. [laughing] Okay, 6 1/2. ♪ ♪ I was thinking about when you... when you came to visit me at St. John B. ♪ ♪ I was still in bad shape. And you said it wasn't my fault. I-I remember. You're the only one from Aeskyton who visited. ♪ ♪ There's something about that place. ♪ ♪ You know. You left. You became a... banker. [laughs] And you ran away to Greece. That was different. ♪ ♪ Something happened to me there. ♪ ♪ It was the start of everything that's happened since. Things happen to all of us. What's important is that we grow past it and we move on. ♪ ♪ [serene music] ♪ ♪ [birds chirping] ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ [whispering] Turn around. Not yet. You don't always get to be the one in control. [gasps] When I was a girl, I'd follow my mother around as she picked the dead flowers out of the garden. My mother thought flowers were sentimental. Let's buy a whole big bunch. [both chuckle] Here. Grab these. These are nice. Those are valueless. [sniffs] Good? [horns honking, engines rumbling] [dramatic music] ♪ ♪ [grunts] ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ Thought I lost you for a sec. I got to go. I just... I'll be in touch. ♪ ♪ [dark music] ♪ ♪ [man shouting] ♪ ♪ Hey! ♪ ♪ [sewing machine whirring] Something for your lady? Not today. I've got gifts. [electric guitar tuning] This is cool. There it is.

How worried do I need to be? ♪ ♪ This your idea of street art? You gonna post these up everywhere, become the next Basquiat? Where'd you get this? I know the drawings that you used to make at the hospital. Where? Let's go inside. I'm not the one posting these flyers. Unlock the door. [keys jingle] Someone else is doing this. [dark music] ♪ ♪ [distant siren wailing] ♪ ♪ Oh, Jesus Christ. Someone stole one of my drawings. Do I need to call Dr. Caligari? No. Do you need to be back on the meds? Will you listen to me?

[distant indistinct voice] ♪ ♪ [power winds down] I'm looking for a Luster fiend. Tall. Bandana and a baseball cap. Did you pay the bill? I paid the bill. Turn on the radio, see if the power's out in Manhattan. These guys have areas. I bet money he's been in here. What radio? There's no electricity. The small one on the shelf with the batteries. Hey. Have you seen my guy? Bandana and a baseball cap. Davey. Hangs out with a bunch of girls. They shoplift cookies. Free ice cream? 30 minutes. If the power's still out, you're first in line. Yeah, why don't you give away the whole store? It's gonna melt. That's $8. Take it out of the 20. [lights popping] [dramatic music] [laughing maniacally] Whoo! ♪ ♪ Can I borrow a couple of your lights? They are part of my studio. I'll buy them from you. And a gift for you girlfriend? Um, how much for a necklace? 40. 30. And ten for the lights. You need a receipt? Are there returns? [cackling] And we are following major breaking news out of New York that is now making national news. A lightning strike upstate caused a cascade power failure... Stuck in the subway systems. Citywide power outage in all five boroughs. [overlapping newscaster voices] Officials say it will be at least late tonight, possibly tomorrow before power is restored to the grid. [distant sirens] Hey, free popsicles! How do you like that, huh? [shopkeeper continues speaking, indistinct] [chatter] You already got some. Here. [tense music] [chatter] ♪ ♪

You stay back, man. I'll scratch your eyes out. What are you? A cat? Knock it off,  bingu. [panting] Man, I ain't do nothing, and I'm not talking about nothing. Not even Ann-Marie Bowen? [dramatic music] Now, I... I saw you tearing these down. [distant siren wails] He's a nice-looking boy. You ever meet him? Because I did. I've seen their rituals. They took me to a house. They laid me on the floor. They took me places. Did they do that to you? Is that why you wear the green sneakers? I-I just need some answers, and I think you know things. Special things. ♪ ♪ I'll buy you a box of Yodels. Buy me some Luster. I'll buy you a beer. Cold beer. Hot day. City going to hell around us. Yeah, it's like the city's dreaming. ♪ ♪ Come on. ♪ ♪ [dramatic music] ♪ ♪ How long were you with them? Three years as a live-in. They started me off in a camp upstate. Then they assigned me to a squat in Brownsville, but they've got fancy places too: Manhattan, Paris, Mumbai. So, who's in charge of the whole thing? Nobody. It's not like there's a pope. There's just overlapping cells. Like Al Qaeda, you know, except without the "destroy Western Civilization" part. What do they want? Utopia. Peace in our time. They're the guardians of the sacred. You know, they're crazy. They're hardcore. I loved it... till the Luster got me booted for being unworthy. [sighs] Did you really meet The Boy? Yeah. I mean, what was it like, man? I mean, was your body, like, all charged and stuff? Not really. I figured if I ever met him, he'd... he'd glow somehow. Who is he? The key to everything. The one that's gonna turn on the lights, teach us we're all dreaming the same dream. So why were you tearing down the flyers? Because. There are people that don't want him to turn on the lights. They like us separated and scared, man. That's why The Boy's got to stay secret. So you were protecting him? Yeah. Wouldn't you? [chatter] [solemn music] ♪ ♪ [horn honking] [shutter clicking] ♪ ♪ Pretty girl! Best be getting home before dark. Waking nightmares.

[grunts] Get out of my head. [both grunt and shout] Get out of my head! [shouts] Get out of... ♪ ♪ I warned you. There's no sign of concussion. The EMTs just wanted her to be cautious. They forced me to call you. She was struck with a wrench. I was taking pictures. And I tripped over a homeless person. Where's my camera? [police radio chatter] Where exactly did you find her? Boarded-up building near Bed-Stuy. My sister wants her camera back. She can't live without it. Is she okay otherwise? Well, she's not in a coma and she didn't get raped, so there's that. Tell me what I can do. Ha. Run. I'll come by later, make you both dinner. Sure you don't want to run? No. [dark music] ♪ ♪ [distant sirens wail] ♪ ♪ [door buzzes] ♪ ♪ [gunshots] [groaning] ♪ ♪ Hey. Hey. Hey. Let go of the gun. It's not her fault. I know. So how about an ambulance? In a minute. I'm bleeding. Tell me about this place first. Aeskyton? Oh, no, no, no, no, no. [winces] That bullet could've hit a major artery. You don't want to go there. That place is the lion's den. This is where she went, isn't it? She was writing a book about a cult that wears green sneakers. [grunts] Is this where they're holding her? Please just get Bizzy out of here. How do I find her? You don't. You give up. You go on with your life. ♪ ♪ I don't accept that. Oh, good God, I feel bad for you. ♪ ♪ Go. Go to Aeskyton. They will greet you with open arms. Give me your wallet, watch, and phone. ♪ ♪ Call the police. When they get here, tell them you were robbed by two white kids. Repeat it. Two... white kids. Two white kids. [breathing heavily] What about her? She'll be taken care of. It's time to go. I guess it is. I never meant to cause her any pain. [distant siren wails] ♪ ♪ He'd been violating me for years. It was practically rape. That's why you're going to Silver Hill and not jail. I can't decide if Nicholas is going to be relieved or angry. Either way, I'll square it with him. He doesn't have a pre-nup. Are you going to that lion's den Woody was talking about? I don't know yet. Well, be careful you don't end up like me. Dreams cut you open. They expose the grungy parts of your soul. Next thing you know, you've got a pistol in your handbag. My therapists were all wrong. They all wanted to bring my demons out into the light. But some poisons are better left in the ground. [sighs] Mmm. It did feel fabulous, though. The dreams? [sighs] Shooting him. [dark music] How long does yogurt keep without refrigeration? At least 12 hours. What are you basing that on? Experience. What about eggs? A week. Are you making this up? Yeah, but it all keeps longer with the door closed. So, I have this open bottle of Beaujolais, and I'm pretty sure that I have a Chilean red and a New Zealand white downstairs. I'm good with either. Do you care? How about both? You two are sisters. It was the two years Mom schlepped us around France. [both speaking French] We're just hanging out. Does she know you speak French? I just know a few key words. You know, we've met before. I remember. You didn't mention it. Neither did you. You know, I know those fliers you're taking pictures of. I'm not the one putting them up. Have you heard of an artist named Kumiko? No. I was wrong about the Chilean red. Uh, just bring the white. I've seen the boy in the fliers. At the Belgian consulate. I saw him again in my dreams. [footsteps approach] So... [phone chimes] I brought a bottle of the Nebbiolo, which is too heavy for the ceviche, but we can drink it after. [electricity powers on] Well, so much for dinner by candlelight. Pour me a glass of the Nebbiolo. I'm gonna use the bathroom. I'm assuming I don't need permission to use the bathroom. [solemn music] ♪ ♪ [distant siren wails] ♪ ♪ Thanks. If all it takes is a citywide power outage to get you to text me, I'm gonna have to arrange another one. ♪ ♪ You want to go back for something? No. Let's go. [engine turns over] ♪ ♪ Your yurt's on the other side of the glade. You're gonna love the dream seminar. You were lucky to get a spot. It's usually booked up way in advance. Karma was on my side. At the end of the day, I guess we all end up where we're supposed to. "The open path lies in wait for the willing." Hobbes, Locke, Rousseau. Three blind mice convinced the world works like a clock. Cogs and gears. But dreams don't have gears. Dreams are water seeping through cracks in the dike. And all it takes to cause a flood is a little bit of darkness.
