 Previously on "Falling Water"... 
 Help me, and I will help you find your son. 
 [yelling] Where are you? 
 This is manic. 
 Do you know what? Get out. 
 Leave me alone. Get out! 
 You make it really goddamn hard to love you. 
 Have you had a dream recently where you were trapped in a room and you couldn't get out? 
 That's Bill's tech. 
 With it, he can make the walls of our dreams absolute or dissolve them entirely. 
 What do they want? 
 They want us to be together. 
 How? 
 The Boy in the flier. 
 He can bring me back. 
 Who is he? 
 The key to everything. 
 The one that's gonna teach us we're all dreaming the same dream. How'd you build this? Your mother built it for us. The room is designed to see into Tess's dreams. When you find The Boy, push the button. There's a woman. She was taken. The people holding her, they want to unleash the same kind of anarchy on humanity that your dreams have unleashed on you. How? The Boy. He's a very special boy. Huge untapped power. Find The Boy. [dramatic music] The Boy can save us both. Wars have two sides. Those who don't pick one get smashed in the middle. [whoosh] ♪ ♪ [ethereal music] And as the storms approached and the armies gathered, the wisest man in the world and the wisest woman in the world stood on the ridge, holding hands. And he said, "Run away with me." "And then what? For the armies will chase us." "Then we'll be together." "And then what? For the storms will follow." "Are you saying there's no hope?" "Yes. I am. But let's do it anyway." I should really know your name. How 'bout Gavin? Russell? If you don't tell me, I'm just gonna have to call you Leviticus. ♪ ♪ You must be hungry.

It's your dream. I'm just a visitor. I didn't believe you. I still don't believe you. [scoffs] How much of this will I remember when I wake up? Most of it. The more you're aware, the more it stays with you. I love you. I love you too. [eerie tone] [brooding dramatic music] ♪ ♪ [soft music] ♪ ♪ [shrill tone] [dog barking distantly] Is everything all right? I saw something in my dream. What'd you see? A matchbook from a restaurant.

[dramatic tone] [eerie music] Sabine. [phone rings] ♪ ♪ [phone ringing] You didn't press the button. What have you done? You were near The Boy. We need The Boy. I... I never saw him. That Boy can do anything. He can reshape the world. He can bend space and time. Do you even understand that kind of power? Give me back Sabine. When you deliver The Boy. This is not what we agreed. This was about helping my mother. This was your mother's idea. [eerie music] [soft brooding music] ♪ ♪ [car horn honks] [indistinct chatter] Sorry. [suspenseful music] ♪ ♪ [soft moaning] [dark music] ♪ ♪ [woman speaking over PA indistinctly] [indistinct radio chatter] [dark tone] [elevator dings] Uh... [softly] She's still here... [speaks indistinctly] [speaks indistinctly] There you are. I don't mean to be a bother, but there are some questions I need to ask about the man that you came in with. It's standard procedure for an injury of this kind. May I sit? Mm-hmm. What can you tell me about, uh, how Mr. Burton got stabbed? He said his girlfriend did it. Do you know his girlfriend's name? No. And what exactly is your relationship with Mr. Burton? He's my neighbor. And his relationship with your son? What is this about? It's just about clarity. How old is your son? Is that him? Yeah. Seven. And his father's name? What does this have to do with my neighbor? I'm not trying to alarm you, but, uh, there's an Amber Alert out for a little blonde boy who was last seen in the company of a man who fits the description of your friend. I see. So you understand why we have to ask these questions? Absolutely. The father's name? I don't know his name. I used a sperm donor. [soft tone] Does your son have any allergies? No. Any identifying scars or marks? No. What's the name of his regular pediatrician? He doesn't have a pediatrician. We moved recently. We were living in France. So he has a passport? At home. I'm sorry to bother you. It's no trouble. [phone buzzing] [phone beeps] Hello? Did you find him? Yeah. Is he okay? Yeah. I'm in Marcello's. There's a lot of blood. It's not his. He's fine. What hospital are you at? I'd like to come meet him. Tess, I need to meet him. [door bangs] [dramatic music] Tess? Please don't run. You'll never get out of this hospital with the Amber Alert. And since I generated the alert, I'm the only one that can clear it up. Please. I just want to explain. Please, just let me explain? Tess? [dark dramatic music] ♪ ♪ [door clanks] Let me out! He's my son! [tense, eerie music] ♪ ♪ [dramatic music] Oh, no. No. No! No! Mama, wake up. [indistinct chatter] [siren wailing distantly] [soft music] ♪ ♪ You again. Come on, we're going. No, wait...

You are the light of my life. I'm not asking you to pick. You can have us both, me and Sabine. She's a lovely girl. Promise me you'll give Tess a choice. Everything's always a choice. [ominous music] [soft music] ♪ ♪ [eerie flittering] [dark dramatic music] ♪ ♪ [eerie flittering continues] [intense whoosh] Would you pour the tea, Adul? You're with them? No. Don't lie, Adul. Tess. Tess. We're going to have this conversation one way or another. [dark dramatic music] [intense whoosh] This doesn't have to be scary. What do you want? To help your son grow. You took him from me. A mistake. We've learned. [intense clatter] Mom. The adults are talking. You'll never outrun us. We're an invisible army. We're everywhere. Mom, she said no. Sit in your chair. [intense whoosh] This isn't multiple choice. You will say yes or we will take The Boy from you. Leave her alone. Be quiet. I know what's best. She's not you. You are a very bad boy. I don't care.

Mama, wake up. [indistinct chatter] [soft music] ♪ ♪ [sighs] I just had this fixed. [groans] This is about you, isn't it? Are you doing this? Well, I guess we better get it right. Come on, stand up. Your mother will be here in a minute. You can't disappear on me like that. We stay together no matter what. [ominous music] I'm sorry. Get out of here. I was wrong. They have your sister. They're holding her, in her dreams. I tried to wake her up, but she wouldn't wake up. How can they do that? They can do whatever they want. They... they gave me this. And I'm supposed to press it when I'm near your son. They said they'd give your sister back to me. [dramatic music building] ♪ ♪ What do we do now? I know someone. A man who might be able to help. You trust him? Not particularly. ♪ ♪ Call him. [dramatic whoosh] [ominous music] ♪ ♪ You're a mess. Don't worry, we'll get you help. Who are you? NYPD. So... this is you.

I don't get involved in anything without a legally-binding contract. See what you can do for Burton. [soft music] ♪ ♪ [sighs] Let me guess. It was two white kids. [weak chuckle] She didn't mean it. They never do. Still playing all sides against the middle. What people don't know, they don't need to know. [ethereal whoosh] [groans] Come. Have a seat. Terms are relatively straight-forward, a personal services contract essentially. You and your son will receive housing, allowance, full-time security, and in return, you will reside in a location of my choosing. Minimum standard of comfort, of course. Uh, we were thinking... uh, Geneva to start? Geneva or Lucerne. A choice for you already. Primary stipulation laid out in section three is that you will give up all freedom of movement. [pensive music] You and your son will be chipped, you'll be monitored, and you will have no communication with anyone that has not been approved. Why not just put us in prison? Prison is for criminals. This is for your own safety. In the wrong hands, your son's power is a danger to us all. What happens if we change our mind? Like I said, the contract is binding. It'll be a perfectly fine life. Better than most. Just not free. ♪ ♪ [dark tone] Read it over. You should sign. Well, there's one good reason not to. Okay, you can be as angry as you want with me, just don't let it make you foolish with yourself. Until he grows up, he's always gonna have people after him. I don't even know who his father is.

[intense music] [ambient music] [machine whirring] [muffled, reverberated] You stay away from my son. I was going to give him back to you. Before this one and that one wrecked my timing, I had it all set. You were going to find him. And I was going to be there. And I was going to be the one who helped you. And you would know that all of your pain and suffering were worth it because you would know that you were a good mother. And you'd have your device. That's... that's money.
