 Previously on "Falling Water"... 
 I like the bear. 
 That one's Sabine's. 
 I used to hide her tooth money in the back. 
 Andy did not stroke out. 
 Then where is he? 
 He moved on. He quit. [grunts] That's beautiful. No, ugh, it's sh1t! The Belgian doesn't wanna sell to White Sand anymore. He wants new buyers, and he wants to be in negotiations this week. We have our first swimmer in the pool. Mr. Song from Malaysia. His top aide was already in Vancouver. You need me. Go away. [moaning] [screams] [soft dramatic music] ♪ ♪ [footsteps approaching] You were supposed to bring him. We didn't think that was a good idea. Then take me to him. We're not sure that's a good idea either. I was promised access from the beginning. Only as far as it was good for his development. He has to belong to all of us. Sacrifices were made. Damage was done... ... For the greater good. .. to my family. And the greater good outweighs your guilt. Please, one last visit. I'm entitled to that. No, you're not. But I will take you to him. One last time. You're back! [laughs softly] You're back! I'm back. Hello. Truck. Truck. I have something special for you. What's it? What is it? He's a tough old bear. He's gonna keep you safe. ♪ ♪ [dark music] ♪ ♪ [muffled explosions and implosions] I'm often reminded that God plays favorites. That doesn't mean he treats his favorites kindly. Jonah was a favorite, and God had him swallowed by a whale. Jonah just wanted to live his life and be left alone. I guess it proves you can have all the free will in the world, and still not have a choice. There's a guard outside your door, another in the room down the hall. They'll rotate in four-hour shifts. Mr. Song overstates my need for security. We've set the suite up with encrypted Wi-Fi which bypasses the hotel network. [door opens] ♪ ♪ You could change the password if you like. What's the password now? Topeka. Like the city in Kansas? Ever been there? Kansas? Never. So when do you sleep? With all the running around, taking care of Wi-Fi? I, uh, steal a few minutes here and there. If you don't sleep, you can't dream, and without dreams, the mind goes irrational. They've done studies. ♪ ♪ [jump rope clicking] [breathing heavily] ♪ ♪ [weights clatter] [breathing heavily] My mother woke up? Not exactly. But she cried out? It was more autonomic response than voluntary motor function. Your mother's oculocephalic response is absent. Her pupils are dilated but reactive, her limbs show waxy flexibility. Her catatonia's unchanged. What about brain energy? An EEG? We checked last night as soon as it happened. No change. Check again. Something happened. [soft dramatic music] ♪ ♪ Yes? Hi. Hello. Should I not be here with you at work? Depends on you. I had a good time the other night. The octopus was great. I meant the other part. I wasn't sure. Like I said, there's a narrow way that I can do things. For most people, it's too much or it's not enough. Either way, it's mine. [cell phone ringing] [exhales] I have to take this. I'm not asking you to understand. I'm asking you to decide if you want to keep going. Take your call. We can talk later. [cell phone continues ringing] [door opens] [cell phone beeps] What's up, Rory? They speak Icelandic in Iceland. No, never been. On my way. [dark music] ♪ ♪ You were supposed to dream today. I needed a day off. Well, you can't just not show up. You left a lot of people waiting. So fire me. [sighs] I'm tired of dreaming and tests. I don't feel good. Ever. When I sleep, when I'm awake. I'm sorry. Do you need a doctor? I need a break. I keep running into those faceless men. It's like they want me to lead them to my son. I think they wanna hurt him. How do you know? How do you know anything in a dream? You feel it. What about your son? I still hear him. But it's like someone... it's like someone's hiding him from me. [sighs] Sounds like you need a break. Thank you. I do have one favor to ask. I want you to dream with me. You have a whole room full of people. They can't help me. I've tried. I need you. I'm a bad dreamer... but I've always known that what you do is possible. When I was 12, my twin sister began to visit me. Our bedrooms were separated by a wall, but... she would... sneak into my dreams. And for two years, we had adventures. We saw oceans, islands, castles in the sky. And then one morning, she didn't wake up. She was catatonic, and I told my parents I thought she was still dreaming, but they put her in an institution and drugged her up and she died there at 16. And ever since then, I've been trapped inside my own puny little dreams. I have seen amazing things, and I am hoping that you can help me see them again. One time. We can go to the lab. No. And not here. There's always my place. [soft dramatic music] ♪ ♪ The Russians are complaining about their office, and the Israeli syndicate wants their own copier. I'll get Jesus on the copier. Can't do anything about the office unless the Chinese are willing to swap. Tell the Chinese it's better feng shui. They won't care. But I'll think of something. How goes the vetting process? The Belgian's happy with her due diligence. I'm not sure she's all that happy with the Belgian's. Well, bids are due tomorrow and she and her boss are our best bet at making the floor price. Without it, the firm will have to eat the difference plus the penalty. That woman didn't fly all the way here to catch a Broadway show. That woman is a black box. No telling what's inside. You've dealt with her before? Once. It was enough. She was working for the Qataris. No one could believe it when Mr. Song hired her away. That good? She reads minds. ♪ ♪ [cell phone ringing] [cell phone beeps] This is Burton. I thought we might have a chat. About Topeka. [soft dramatic music] ♪ ♪ Come. Have a seat. Can I have them bring you anything? No, thank you. Well, at least take coffee. So I can feel I'm being hospitable. No, thank you. So... how are things with your paranoid Belgian? He's vetting buyers for his holdings. Whatever they bid, I would have bid more. So bid more. [chuckles softly] After Montreal, he refuses to do business with me. That's the problem with paranoia. Makes you financially foolish. ♪ ♪ Something the matter? On the phone, you said "Topeka." What is it? [exhales] There are precious few individuals who understand how markets truly work. Markets run on fear. Fear the stock you didn't buy is gonna go up, fear the stock you did buy is gonna go down. Now, if you could invade the minds of key traders... invade their dreams... ... create fear...  [fireworks exploding] Incite fear... then you'd have advance warning. If you know which way the markets are gonna move, you could position yourself properly and scoop up the profits with a shovel. Almost like insider trading. In a way. And that's Topeka? No, no. Topeka's a much bigger idea. I just want you to understand, there are answers to all your questions. [distorted voice] About what Jones was doing, and other things. ♪ ♪ [mouthing words] ♪ ♪ If you agree to come and work for me. ♪ ♪ [screaming] I like the job I have. You wouldn't be doing anything you're not already doing. [screaming] ♪ ♪ This is a geological analysis of your Belgian's holdings. The mining deposits he's selling, they're played out. Exhausted. Have been for some time. They're worthless. A week ago, you offered the Belgian nine figures. The value of a thing is not necessarily the thing itself. Sometimes, there are hidden layers of value. Like a diamond in a tub of ice cream. ♪ ♪ [fireworks exploding] [screaming] That's it. Move some of those. Yeah, move those bags around. Never know where the evidence is. [indistinct chatter] There's the Quiet Man. Hunch, you made it. Are you expecting those rookies to find something? Not really. Keeps their heads from getting big. Yeah, so what's this about Iceland? 6:00 A.M. this morning, corpse in bag was a body in the dumpster. He was kind enough to carry an ID, but when I ran it, Interpol hit came back. He's supposed to be serving ten years in an Icelandic prison. Lost the beard since then. Fake ID? Nope. And no twin brother either. That's screwed up. Well, you being the man with the international connections, I'm counting on you to unscrew it. Come on, Johnny, at least blow in my ear before you take me to bed. Foreplay's for suckers. ♪ ♪ [exhales] I need to go out and I need you to drive me. I'll get you a driver. I have certain needs. Things that if I can't get them, I can't do my job. Don't you have a local supplier? Not in New York. These things are not found in savory areas, so I thought you'd prefer to accompany me. ♪ ♪ In a dumpster? Pushed or jumped off a nearby building. That's... wow. I have 19 dead people in my contacts. When I fire someone, I delete them immediately, but when they die, I can't bring myself to do it. So Andy makes 20? No. I deleted him. Andy was part of a research group studying cognitive sleep function, and when he left the study, I removed him. How'd he get into the study? Fit the criteria. We're exploring next-gen connectivity. It involves specialized brain-wave patterns. It was a shame when he washed out. You have many other Icelandic convicts in your study? Ah, okay. According to Litla-Hraun Prison, Andy was two years into a homicide stretch when he was furloughed to your custody. My supervision. It was a vehicular homicide. He was a tourist who hit a cow, and a girl he was with died. Look, when Andy left, I bought him a ticket, I walked him through security, and I put him on a plane back to Reykjavík. Call the airline. I will. Andy always meant well. Too bad you deleted him. [sighs] Sorry to keep him. It's fine. ♪ ♪ Have a good day. You too. [soft dramatic music] ♪ ♪ 
 
 This is, uh... ... Modest? What did the police want? Just old news. Disgruntled employee. It's nothing to worry about. So how do you wanna get started? Uh... I'll take the bed. You can take the couch. I am going to need a sleeping pill. Would you like a sleeping pill? No, with all the tests, I've gotten pretty good at falling asleep. [remote beeps] [whirring] ♪ ♪ [indistinct children shouting] ♪ ♪ Hi. I have to sit with my sister. If I don't, our mom won't take us to the pool. [children laughing] ♪ ♪ [children laughing] [dramatic music] ♪ ♪ [children laughing] Why won't she sit with me? [children laughing] ♪ ♪ [children laughing] Bill. Come with me. I can't leave my sister. Tell her you'll be back. I'll be back. [bell ringing] How did we end up here? After you. [soft music] [laughs] ♪ ♪ [soft dramatic music] ♪ ♪ [dramatic music] ♪ ♪ [suspenseful music] We have to move. ♪ ♪ Go away! Come on. ♪ ♪ [soft dramatic music] ♪ ♪ [baby cries] [dramatic music] ♪ ♪ Go. I'll be fine. ♪ ♪ [baby cries] [suspenseful music] ♪ ♪ 
♪ ♪ [dramatic music] ♪ ♪ [soft dramatic music] ♪ ♪ Bill? Bill? Are you okay? That was, uh... [scoffs] Tell me what happened after we split up. I went back inside. I locked the door. And then? And they vanished or retreated. What about you? Your son? He wasn't there. He always just slips out of my fingers. ♪ ♪ What's your pleasure? Luster. Lady can dance. It's 50 a vial. Youngin' bring your boodle. [zipper rasps] [sighs] You're a dear. [blowtorch sparks] ♪ ♪ Can I ask you something? I'd love to say no, but you have me at a disadvantage. Why is a Malaysian banker interested in rare earth metals? Money. And power. Even if the deposits are played out. Who have you been talking to? I've seen the geo-report. It says the Belgian's holdings are worthless. Ah... White Sand. H. Robert must be desperate and angry if he told you. Is he wrong? ♪ ♪ You should be wary of H. Robert. He's not worthy of you. Whatever he offered, Mr. Song will double, but, really, I'd avoid Mr. Song too. A gang of shadow men. [echoing] Feasting. Wake up. Take me home. Tell me why you want the deposits. [exhales sharply] [dramatic music] [fireworks exploding] ♪ ♪ My God... [mouth words] she is beautiful. What are you talking about? You fool. She loves you. ♪ ♪ [mouthing words] Hey! Hey! ♪ ♪ [door opens] He checked in just like you were told, but he never actually boarded the flight, so we pulled his bag before takeoff. When no one claimed it, it came here. You got a lot of misplaced luggage. I prefer to think of it as "in transit." Adrift in a gray zone between departure and arrival. [device beeps] Yep, there we go. That's your boy's bag. Now, technically, I can't let you examine the contents without a warrant, but I'm real thirsty, so I'm gonna go get a 15 minute drink of water. Good for you? Yeah, I'll wait right here. [soft dramatic music] ♪ ♪ [grunts] [dark music] ♪ ♪ [cell phone ringing] Hello? Are you ready to have an honest conversation? I saw you this morning. I've been keeping my distance, letting you find your own path, but Alice says you have questions. Tell me about the boy on the flyer. I'm staring at a whole bag of 'em. Is that really what you wanna ask about? Who is he? Tell me something. How did you get your mother to join us in the woods? That was you. Not us. I don't know what you're talking about? Lies are pointless and a waste of time. [cell phone beeps] ♪ ♪ You look like whale vomit. I'm fine. Mr. Song's looking for his girl. She hasn't come back? I thought she was out with you. No. Well, he's screaming bloody murder, so Hull is screaming bloody murder, so I'm supposed to scream at you. I think the Firm's getting played. By who? The Belgian maybe. I was given a geo-report. It says the deposits we're selling are worthless. And who gave you this report? Read it yourself. This is wrong. What if it's not? Consider the source. There's a lie here. Why are you barking at me? We're being maneuvered like puppets. Well, that's the job. That's the world. A week ago, White Sand was bidding nine figures. Today, H. Robert gave me that report. The deal's a sham. We don't even know what we're selling. Rare-earth metals. Come on. I don't know what's going on with you or when you last slept, but you don't get to barge in here, rave like a lunatic, and piss all over the carpet, so knock it off. [door opens] Mr. Song's on the box breathing fire. He can't get Isla on the phone and he's threatening to pull his bid. Go check her hotel. Find her. Before we all drown. [distant chatter] [dark music] _ ♪ ♪ [soft dramatic music] ♪ ♪ [elevator bell dings] [electronic lock beeps and clicks] [door opens and closes] ♪ ♪ [exhales] [fireworks exploding faintly] [whispering voices] ♪ ♪ I thought you could find me. What are you doing here? Spying on you, dear. They all wanna know just how strong your dreams are. And my, they are strong. You saw her? In the car? She was standing in the street. It's only fair. You saw me when you were dreaming. You chased me. We were awake. Hmm. It's a thin line. Where is she? I'm not allowed to tell. They have me bound. Body and soul. ♪ ♪ I'm a barnacle. No dreams of my own, so I cling to the dreams of others. My prison isn't my talent. My talent is my prison. Where is she? Do you really wanna know their secret? ♪ ♪ [laughs] Where is she? [fireworks exploding] Where is she? [dramatic music] ♪ ♪ [gasping, straining] [fireworks exploding] [indistinct shouting] ♪ ♪ [distorted voice] Take my hand. ♪ ♪ [horns honking] [indistinct shouting] No! No! Hey! No! [fireworks exploding] [soft dramatic music] ♪ ♪ Isla came in. Found you passed out. She's quite spooked. Won't even come in the room. She's in the hall. [grunts] I, uh... I need to talk to her. Sit. Sit. [exhales] What's the Belgian really selling? Did you even read the geo-report? Helena gave it to me. It's ink on paper. It's fraud. If it was fraud, we never would've made the floor price. ♪ ♪ Who's the buyer? Isla and Mr. Song. Finalized the details during your siesta. [scoffs] You don't even care. As long as there's money. There's a Taoist parable about a student who walks 800 miles to visit the Great Master. When he gets to the Great Master's estate, he finds the Master out in the fields, head down, tending his crops. The student says, "Oh, Great Master, I have walked 800 miles to ask you one question. [whispers] "What is the key to a virtuous life?'" And the Master just keeps his head down and goes on tending his crops. I quit. We'll talk after you get some sleep. ♪ ♪ I quit. [exhales sharply] [door opens] [door closes, footsteps approach] You bought that boy, didn't you? From the Belgian? Mr. Song bought rare-earth metals from the Belgian. You don't buy and sell people. ♪ ♪ Of course not, dear. That would be immoral. ♪ ♪ Don't smile. Don't do it. The back of my head is the good side. [dark music] ♪ ♪ What is it? Do you recognize this? Is it...? It's different. The signs, the stores. That's the window. Where you saw your son. Should we? Why not. ♪ ♪ 
♪ ♪ As kids, my sister and I had matching bears. We used to sew our tooth fairy money in the back. [metal clinks] Is it yours? I have to talk to my mother. [dark music] ♪ ♪ [cell phone ringing] If you're ready to have a real conversation. I'm across the street. ♪ ♪ I should arrest you. You could, but I'd just ask for a lawyer, and the conversation that we need to have would never occur. Get in. I'm not going anywhere. You're the one with the gun. What are you afraid of? Don't you wanna heal your mother? ♪ ♪ We can help you. But you have to get in the van. My mother? How? She's not gone. She's still in there. Lost in her dreams. Don't let her waste away, when you can still reach her. It's now or never. In or out? ♪ ♪ 
♪ ♪ [exhaling] ♪ ♪ Help me. How? Imagine Jonah. Alone, in the dark, inside the whale. Knowing he had no choice. [door opens] ♪ ♪ I don't care how warm the sunlight was when he washed up on the beach. That kind of pain and fear... Gets in your bones. Fate's a b*st*rd, destiny's worse, and free will? That's for men higher up the food chain. May love's light shine down on you. But not too brightly.
