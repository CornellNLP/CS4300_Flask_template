 Previously on "Falling Water"... 
 It was a gift from the ambassador. 
 I've seen the boy in the flyers at the Belgian consulate. 
 Aeskyton? 
 This is where she went, isn't it? 
 You don't want to go there. 
 Something happened to me there. 
 It was the start of everything that's happened since. 
 I know this is scary, but together we can find your son. 
 They were betrayed. By who? Fat men who eat too much ice cream. Your mother's catatonia's unchanged. Wake up! Who is he? He's the Belgian ambassador to the UN. He was my silent partner. Our Belgian client has concerns. He's always concerned. Yeah, he's congenitally paranoid.

With the new ambassador coming in, we're all shifting offices. If it isn't rude, what happened to the old ambassador? He passed away. Have you seen this boy? Where did you get this? It's her son. He's missing, and a friend of ours said he thought he may have seen him here. How old is your son? He's seven. This is going to sound strange. We're good with strange. I used to have a drawing of this same boy. But it was 30 years old. The ambassador got it for me. I found out recently it was on the back of a record album. Can I see the drawing? I don't have it. We had it in a reception after the ambassador's funeral. One of his business partners stole it off my wall. A boring, paranoid man, but all to happy to help himself to my property. You know, we'd really love to see this drawing. You wouldn't have the business partner's contact information? He has an office in midtown. If you see my drawing there, steal it.

I have these... dreams. They stay with me. And is that why you're here? If I'm honest? Rather a waste if you're not. [ominous tone] There's a woman. I lost her somehow. One moment she was in my arms, the next she vanished completely. Like a bad dream. [dark music] And where is she now? I don't know. Did she come here? Yes. Was that her in the picture you were looking at? Did you know her? I remember everyone. Mind like a Venus flytrap. But it's your journey I'm interested in. Her journey is my journey. Following in her footsteps? I was hoping to find my way back to her. Well, you can't do that until you understand why she left. How did you meet? ♪ ♪ We met in a bar. It was a Tuesday. We went back to her place and didn't leave for a week. I was working in London, so we'd have these bursts of time, then gaps. What did she do while she was here? Well, I could answer that, but I think we better get back to why you stopped seeing each other. Did you have sessions like this with her? Yes, but the details of those sessions aren't for me to share. How did you feel when she vanished? Like a boat on a dark ocean. And what about before that, when you were on your break? Were you seeing other people? No. Did she? No. You sure? What do you mean? What if you were having a dream, and in that dream she was married to another man? I'd know it was a dream. What if it was actually true? That she had a husband? She didn't. I'd know. Are you sure? ♪ ♪ What are you trying to say? You only saw each other in short bursts. ♪ ♪ I'd know. There.

What do you think you're doing? Alice's boss saw you and called her parents. Yeah, I had to ask her some questions. She's my patient, and a minor. You had to know I'd find out. So which is it, did you not think or did you not care? I care. There are connections. My case, the people in Alice's cult. They say they can heal my mother. Your mother. Your medically catatonic mother whose condition has gone unchanged for seven years. They told me there was hope. [solemn music] And that's why you were interested in Alice. ♪ ♪ That's why you were interested in me. No. You were separate. Don't touch me. I never meant to to lie to you.

Ever since we saw him at that window, it's like... I'm gonna find him around the next corner. Only when I get around the corner, he's... hidden, somehow. Hidden or hiding? The Belgian can't be the end. He was business partners with the ambassador. What was their business? [inhales sharply] If only there was some sort of pocket computer that we could use to answer these sorts of questions. [keys clacking] ♪ ♪ Rare-earth metals. ♪ ♪ Seems they recently sold a large chunk of their holdings to a Malaysian company. Hm, I know the firm that brokered the deal.

The ambassador died in Montreal of a drug overdose. I was there. I saw her do it. You were asleep in a car parked by the side of the road. Alice at least has the decency to be haunted.
