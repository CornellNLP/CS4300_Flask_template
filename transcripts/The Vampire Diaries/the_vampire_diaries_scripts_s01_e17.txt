 PREVIOUSLY ON ''THE VAMPIRE DIARIES'' 
 STEFAN: For over a century, I have lived in secret until now. I know the risk. But I have to know her. 
 DAMON: There's a tomb underneath the church. A spell sealed Katherine in that tomb, protecting her. I'm gonna bring her back. 
 DAMON: She's not there! 
 STEFAN: You saved everyone in the church? 
 PEARL: We've taken up residence in a farmhouse just outside of town. 
 DAMON: All 25 vampires? 
 PEARL: Some. 
 FREDERICK: I hate this house. I didn't stay locked up for 145 years to end up locked up here. 
 PEARL: So, where's Bethanne? 
 FREDERICK: She won't be coming back. 
 ALARIC: My wife Isobel spent her life researching paranormal activity in this area. What have you done to my wife? 
 DAMON: I turned her. 
 JEREMY: Maybe there is such a thing as vampires. They're just different from the way we always thought they were. 
 JEREMY: Aah! You got a problem with blood, Anna? Ahh! 
 JEREMY: I knew this girl Vicki. She was attacked by an animal, a bite to the neck. And then I saw your face. 
 ANNA: Why would you confront me about it? 
 JEREMY: Because maybe it's true about Vicki. And also because I want you to turn me. 
 GILBERT'S HOUSE 
 Elena sleeps whereas, outside it makes a violent one storm. Suddenly, it awakes in start because her window opens brutally. It rises and will close again it shocked. On their side, Jeremy in his room, sitting on his bed whereas Anna looks at outside. 
 ANNA: I love storms. 
 JEREMY: Is that a vampire thing? 'cause I read vampires don't like running water. 
 ANNA: It's only Dracula. Yeah. He was a complete wuss. Never showered. Very smelly. 
 JEREMY: Seriously? 
 ANNA: First rule about vampires, don't believe anything you read. 
 JEREMY: You gotta tell me more. I gotta know. 
 ANNA: No, you don't. 'cause you're not gonna be one. 
 JEREMY: Come on, you can't keep saying "no" To me. 
 ANNA: Look, I'm not gonna turn someone who learned everything he knows about vampires from Netflix. 
 JEREMY: That's not true, and you know it. 
 ANNA: Why do you even want this? Give me one good reason. 
 JEREMY: 'cause I... 
 ANNA: Hmm. Let me know when you can finish that sentence. 
 (Elena returns in the room, Anna left) 
 ELENA: Hey, you're still up. 
 JEREMY: Hey, what's up? 
 ELENA: Looks like the there's a big storm rolling in. Can you help make sure all the windows are closed? 
 JEREMY: Yeah. Yeah. Sure. 
 MLLE GIBBONS' HOUSE 
 Pearl comes to talks with Frederick. 
 FREDERICK: We're running low on blood. You might wanna send Anna to the hospital for some more. 
 PEARL: I'll send her out for some tomorrow. 
 FREDERICK: Maybe I could go with her. If the storm keeps it dark enough, I might be able to go out during the day, no sun and all. 
 PEARL: I'm afraid not. Not after your stunt at the Salvatore house tonight. 
 FREDERICK: He and his brother deserved it. 
 PEARL: And where did that get you? Your girlfriend Bethanne is dead. And you have no one to blame but yourself. We cannot live our lives about revenge. We have to have better control of our emotions. 
 FREDERICK: I understand, miss Pearl. I just wish I knew what you were up to. 
 PEARL: I'm going to make an exploratory visit into town tomorrow to assess who's under the influence of vervain and who isn't. Anna tells me that the players haven't changed much. It's still the Lockwoods, the Forbes, the Fells... 
 FREDERICK: We should kill every last one of them. 
 PEARL: We are smarter than that, Frederick. These people are not our enemies. We don't hold grudges and resentments. We'll get our town back. We just have to have patience. 
 FREDERICK: You heard her. No revenge. Patience. Self-control. She seems to have it all figured out, doesn't she? 
 THE VAMPIRE DIARIES 
 SALVATORE'S HOUSE 
 Damon stopping the hole of the window with a board while Stefan and Elena look at him. 
 DAMON: I say we go to Pearl's, bust down the door, and annihilate the idiot that attacked us last night. 
 STEFAN: Yeah. And then what? We turn to the rest of that house of vampires and say, "Oops. Sorry?" 
 ELENA: I can't believe you made a deal with her. 
 DAMON: It was more like a helpful exchange of information. And it's not like a choice. She's... scary. Besides, she's gonna help me get Katherine back. 
 ELENA: Of course she is. Damon gets what he wants, as usual. No matter who he hurts in the process. 
 DAMON: You don't have to be snarky about it. 
 ELENA: I woke up this morning to learn that all the vampires have been released from the tomb. I've earned snarky. 
 DAMON: How long are you going to blame me for turning your birth mother into a vampire? 
 ELENA: I'm not blaming you, Damon. I've accepted the fact that you're a self-serving psychopath with no redeeming qualities. 
 DAMON: Ouch. 
 STEFAN: This isn't being very productive. We're gonna figure out a way to deal with Pearl and the vampires. Yeah? Hmm. 
 (Damon goes out) 
 ELENA: I'm sorry. He just makes me so cranky. 
 STEFAN: I know. He makes everybody cranky. 
 ELENA: So, what are we going to do? 
 STEFAN: Damon and I are gonna handle everything, I promise. 
 ELENA: Well, what about me? I can't just sit here and do nothing. 
 STEFAN: That's exactly what you're gonna do, because that's what going to keep you safe. 
 ELENA: Which means nothing if you're not safe, too. 
 STEFAN: What do you mean? I'm perfectly safe. I have Damon, the self-serving psychopath on my side. 
 ELENA: Well, that's comforting. 
 MISTIC GRILL 
 Jeremy talks with Anna. 
 ANNA: Ok. We have some time. I'm not meeting my mom until later. 
 JEREMY: Wait. Does your mom know you're a... 
 ANNA: The fact that you would even think it's possible to keep something like that a secret from your own family is just further proof that you're not ready. 
 JEREMY: "Not ready" Is a step up from "No." 
 ANNA: And a million steps down from "Maybe." I like your bracelet. 
 JEREMY: Thanks. My sister got it for me. 
 ANNA: Can I see it? 
 JEREMY: Yeah. Yeah. 
 ANNA: Your sister doesn't know you're hanging out with me, does she? 
 JEREMY: No. No. But I don't see why it would be a problem. It's not like she knows what you are. 
 ANNA: I'd rather keep it our little secret. 
 JEREMY: You know, why don't you...why don't you keep this? 
 ANNA: Why would you give this to me? 
 JEREMY: Because. You like it. And I like you. 
 ANNA: You only like me because of what you want from me. 
 JEREMY: No. I...I like you. 
 ANNA: Um... You know, you should wear it. It looks better on you anyway. 
 Matt talks with Caroline. 
 MATT: I yelled at my mom last night. You know, I feel like the parent and the screwed-up kid. 
 CAROLINE: Maybe she needed to hear it. 
 MATT: Yeah, but just... I worry that if I push too hard, then she will take off again. 'cause that's her M.O. Just like Vicki, who I haven't heard from since she left. 
 CAROLINE: Well, you can't control your mom, Matt, any more than you can 
 control your sister. 
 MATT: I wish that she would just try a little. You know? If she would just try to try, that'd be ok. 
 CAROLINE: Maybe she'll surprise you. People have a tendency to do that. I should go before the roads get even worse from the storm. 
 MATT: Yeah. Are you sure you should be driving right now? 
 CAROLINE: I have to. It's my dad's boyfriend's daughter's birthday. We have a non-traditional traditional ritual. 
 MATT: Well, buckle up. Don't speed. Stay off your cell phone. And call me when you get there. 
 CAROLINE: Got it. Anything else? 
 MATT: Yes. 
 CAROLINE: Bye. 
 MATT: Bye. 
 SALVATORE'S HOUSE 
 Damon putting the clock per hour while Stefan between in a hurry. 
 DAMON: Hunting party? 
 STEFAN: That guy did a number on me last night when he stabbed me. I gotta get my strength back up. 
 DAMON: I've got 2 liters of soccer mom in the fridge. No? 
 STEFAN: We'll talk when I get back? 
 DAMON: All right. Give my regards to the squirrels. 
 DRILL 
 Stefan, under the beating rain, drives out. Suddenly, it stops bus of the vampires are behind him. It is turned over. But Frederick is pointed in front of him and inserts a pile in the body to him. 
 STEFAN: Aah! 
 GILBERT'S HOUSE 
 The telephone of Elena sounds, she takes it but notes that it is Damon. She is unaware of the call. A few seconds later, somebody sounds. She will open, it is Damon which enters. 
 DAMON: You're ignoring me 
 ELENA: The 6 missed calls? Sorry. My phone is dead. 
 DAMON: Is Stefan here? 
 ELENA: No. Why? Something wrong? 
 DAMON: He went out to the woods and didn't come back. I can't get him on his phone. I figured he was here with you. 
 ELENA: It's going straight to voice-mail. Where could he be? 
 DAMON: You're not going to like what I'm thinking. 
 MLLE GIBBONS' HOUSE 
 Damon knocks on the door. 
 DAMON: Pearl! Open this door. I swear to God I'll bust through and rip your head off. 
 FREDERICK: Pearl's not home. Hmm. Beautiful weather. Not a ray of sun in the sky. 
 DAMON: Where's my brother? 
 FREDERICK: Billy. 
 (Two vampires appear trailing failing Stefan) 
 DAMON: You're dead. 
 FREDERICK: Whoa. I'm sorry. You haven't been invited in. Miss Gibbons? 
 (She comes in) 
 GIBBONS: Yes, Frederick honey? 
 FREDERICK: Never let this bad man in. 
 GIBBONS: I'll never let him in. 
 STEFAN: Ugh! 
 FREDERICK: 145 years left starving in a tomb, thanks to Katherine's infatuation with you and your brother. First few weeks, every single nerve in your body screams with fire. The kind of pain that can drive a person mad. Well... I thought your brother might've wanted to get a taste of that before I killed him. Billy. 
 STEFAN: Uhh! Aah! 
 FREDERICK: You have a nice day. 
 GRILL 
 Elena asks to Damon what it's happened. 
 ELENA: What happened? Where is he? 
 DAMON: They have him. I can't get in. 
 ELENA: Why not? 
 DAMON: Because the woman that owns the house is compelled to not let me in. 
 ELENA: I can get in. 
 DAMON: You're not going in there. 
 ELENA: I'm going! 
 DAMON: You're not going there. 
 ELENA: Why are they doing this? What do they want with him? 
 DAMON: Revenge. They want revenge. 
 ELENA: We gotta do something. 
 DAMON: I know. 
 ELENA: We can't let them hurt him. We gotta get him out of there. 
 DAMON: I know. Elena, I know. But I don't know how to get him out. 
 MLLE GIBBONS'S HOUSE 
 Vampires connecting Stefan with cords covered with vervain in the cave. 
 FREDERICK: Vervain on the ropes. 
 STEFAN: Aah! Unh! 
 FREDERICK: That's gotta sting. Speaking of... 
 STEFAN: Aah! 
 (Harper comes in) 
 HARPER: This isn't right! 
 FREDERICK: He killed Bethanne. One of us, Harper. And don't you think for a second he wouldn't kill you if he had the chance. Pearl says we're not here for revenge, right? I say that's exactly what we're here for. Starting with this. 
 STEFAN: Aah! Aah! 
 FREDERICK: And then his brother. And anyone else that gets in our way. 
 HARPER: This isn't right! 
 FREDERICK: You're gonna want to let go of me! 
 HARPER: Miss Pearl will be home soon. 
 FREDERICK: Miss Pearl is no longer in charge. Tie him up! And then stake him down. 
 HIGH SCHOOL 
 Alaric going in his class when he crosses Damon. They are fixed. 
 DAMON: Well, don't you look... alive? 
 ALARIC: You can't hurt me. 
 DAMON: Oh, I can hurt you, all right. 
 ELENA: Mr. Saltzman. We need your help. 
 They enter in the classroom. 
 ELENA: Stefan's in the house. Damon's a vampire. He can't get in. We need you. I would go, but... 
 DAMON: Your life is valuable. Yours, on the other hand... 
 ELENA: Stefan told me about your ring. 
 ALARIC: What about it? 
 DAMON: Let me recap...You tried to kill me. I defended myself. You died. Then according to my brother, your ring brought you back to life. Am I leaving anything out? 
 ALARIC: Yeah. The part where I try and kill you again. Only this time, I don't miss. 
 ELENA: Mr. Saltzman. Please. It's Stefan. 
 ALARIC: I'm sorry, Elena. But it's not my problem. 
 DAMON: That's a shame. Because the woman in charge of the crowd can help you find your wife. 
 ALARIC: You're lying. 
 DAMON: Am I? Why don't you ask her yourself? Coward. Come on, Elena. 
 ALARIC: All right! Wait. I'll go. 
 MYSTIC GRILL 
 Jeremy gives his answer to Anna asks him. 
 JEREMY: So, I have an answer. 
 ANNA: To what? 
 JEREMY: Why you should turn me. 
 ANNA: We're back to that? 
 JEREMY: Look, I wake up every day, and I feel ok, but there's something missing. Like a...like a hole. Some people, they fit... in life, or whatever. I... I don't. 
 ANNA: So, you want a pity-turn? I don't think so. 
 JEREMY: You should turn me because I don't have anything else. 
 ANNA: Do you even know why we turn other people? It's not to give someone a one-way ticket out of loner-hood. Ok? One--we need someone to do our dirty work. Two, revenge. Three, boredom... but, you know, that never turns out well. And then you know there's the obvious one. You love someone so much that you would do anything to spend all of eternity with them. Ahem. I'm sorry, but you don't fit any of those categories yet. 
 (Anna sees her mother to enter in the grill) 
 ANNA: So, yeah. Just make sure your thesis is clear, and she'll love it. See you later. 
 (She joins her) 
 ANNA: Mom, hey. 
 PEARL: Did you get everything? 
 ANNA: Yeah, the blood-bank was understaffed because of the rain. I was in and out. 
 PEARL: Who's that you were talking to? 
 ANNA: A friend from the library. 
 PEARL: Let's get home. 
 M. Lockwood and Tyler enter in the grill. 
 M. LOCKWOOD: Hey, you're not going out in that, are ya? The roads are dangerous. Route 5 is completely flooded. 
 PEARL: We'll make do. 
 WAITRESS: Mayor Lockwood, we have your table ready. 
 TYLER: Great. 
 PEARL: Mayor... Lockwood, is it? I suppose it is treacherous outside. My name is Pearl. 
 M. LOOKWOOD: Hi. 
 PEARL: This is my daughter Anna. We've just recently moved to town. 
 M. LOOKWOOD: Welcome. Richard Lockwood. This is my son Tyler. Please--please, join us. 
 PEARL: It would be a pleasure. 
 TYLER: Be more creepy, dad. Not like your son is standing right here. 
 M. LOOKWOOD: Grow up. Elections are coming. She's a constituent. And a rich one, from the looks of it. 
 TYLER: You can tell all that by looking at her ass? Awesome. I'm gonna go shoot some pool. 
 ALARIC'S CLASSROOM 
 Alaric shows his weapons to fight vampires. 
 DAMON: Teacher by day, vampire hunter by night. 
 ALARIC: I've you to thank for that. 
 ELENA: What are these? 
 ALARIC: Those are tranquilizer darts filled with vervain. 
 DAMON: Just get me in. I'll get Stefan out. 
 ELENA: That's your plan? You're just gonna take them all on yourself? 
 DAMON: Well, I'll be a little stealthier than that, hopefully. 
 ALARIC: Whoa. What are you doing? 
 ELENA: I'm going with you guys. 
 DAMON: No. No. No. No. No way. 
 ELENA: You need me. I'll get in. You could distract them, and then I'll get Stefan out. 
 DAMON: You'll get yourself killed. You're not going in there. 
 ELENA: I'm going. 
 DAMON: So, when you get me in, get out as quickly as you can. I know how to sneak around where they can't hear me. You'll basically just be in the way. 
 ELENA: Damon, now is not the time to be the lone ranger. 
 DAMON: Fine. Elena, you can drive the getaway car. You're not going in the house. 
 ELENA: You can't stop me. It's Stefan we're talking about here. You don't understand. 
 DAMON: Oh, I understand. I understand. He's the reason you live. His love lifts you up where you belong. I get it. 
 ELENA: Can you just not joke around for 2 seconds? 
 DAMON: I can't protect you, Elena. I don't know how many vampires there are in there. That's how long it takes you to get your head ripped off. I have to be able to get in and get out. I can't be distracted with your safety. Or this will end up a bloodbath that none of us walk away from...Including Stefan. I know. I get it. I understand. 
 ALARIC: If we're gonna go, let's go.

 DAMON: Parents, children, anyone else who lives on this property? 
 MLLE GIBBONS: No. It's just me. 
 DAMON: Good. 
 ALARIC: You were supposed to compel her.
