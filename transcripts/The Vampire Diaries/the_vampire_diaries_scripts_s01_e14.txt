 Anna:A party, right next to the old cemetery.Isn't that nice of them?Lots of warm bodys for starving vampires. 
 Damon:I told you.I work alone. 
 Anna:Yeah, so do I.But you're minus a witch And I'm minus spell book.So what do you say? 
 Damon:Stefan will come after you, you know that.For messing with elena. 
 Anna:Then he won't be too happy if I kill her When I don't get what want. 
 Damon:When do you want to do this? 
 Anna:God, it's like 1864 all over again.You salvatores are truly pathetic when it comes to women.Tonight. After sundown.Meet at the church. 
 Back to Anna's , Ben's aking some quetions to the girls. 
 Ben:Witches don't have eternal life, right?So you guys can die.

 Stefan:Let's get outside.[He approach Ben]When the sun goes down,Leave town.If I ever see you again,I will kill you. 
 At Grams Place . Bonnie and Grams are around the table. 
 Bonnie:How did you know where we were? 
 Grams:Many things can feel a witch's power.Worry, anger.After stefan told me that they had taken you, I had a lot of both.Simple locator spell was easy after that. 
 Bonnie:I'm sorry.About all of this. 
 Grams:Not as sorry as they're gonna be. 
 [Stefan and Elena comes] 
 Elena:So what do we do now? 
 Stefan:For now, you need to stay here. 
 Grams:A prisoner,in my own home?I don't think so. 
 Stefan:I can't protect you if you leave the house. 
 Grams:We'll protect ourselves. 
 Elena:We need to let him have katherine back.He's not going to stop until he gets her.If we help him,maybe that ends it. 
 Bonnie:No! He doesn't deserve to get what he wants. 
 Elena:What other choice do we have? 
 Grams:Witches being pulled down by vampire problems.As much as we tried 
 to do to stay out of it.I'll open the tomb.You get your brother's girl,And destroy the rest with fire.Then this will be all over. 
 Stefan:We still have to get damon to agree. 
 Elena:He already agreed once. 
 Stefan:Yeah, and then we double cross him.So now he's angry. 
 Elena:He's hurt. There's a difference.I think I know what I have to do. 
 Back to Anna's Place ; Ben's hidding from the sun. 
 Anna:You've got to be kidding me. 
 Ben:It was stefan.There was nothing I could- 
 Anna:Shut up! Stop talking.Without the witch,We don't have damon or the grimoire.Damon's not going to stop.He'll find a way to get in.And we're going to be 
 there when he does. 
 At the Salvatore's place , Damon's packing some books ,Elena comes. 
 Damon:I'm going to have to change the locks.Did you stage a jailbreak? 
 Elena:Stefan. 
 Damon:Oh, brother.Ever the white knight. 
 Elena:I convinced bonnie to help you. 
 Damon:I doubt that. 
 Elena:I'm not going to say that I'm sorry We got the grimoire without you last night,Because I'm not, really. 
 Damon:Well, at least you're honest. 
 Elena:I was protecting the people I love, damon.But so were you,In your own, 
 twisted way.And as hard as it is to figure,We're all on the same side,After the same thing. 
 Damon:Not interested. 
 Elena:Yes, you are.Because you were willing to work with us yesterday. 
 Damon:Fool once,shame on you. 
 Elena:Ok, when we were in atlanta,Why didn't you use your compulsion on me? 
 Damon:Who's to say I didn't? 
 Elena:You didn't.I know you didn't.But you could have.You and I...We have something.An understanding.And I know that my betrayal hurt you,Different from how it is with you and Stefan,But I'm promising you this now,I ll help you get katherine back. 
 Damon:I wish I could believe you. 
 [She took her necklace off] 
 Elena:Ask me if I'm lying now. 
 Damon:No animal will stop, by the way,No matter what I do. 
 Elena:Then we'll deal with it. 
 [He put her necklace back] 
 Damon:I didn't compel you in atlanta because we were having fun.I wanted it to be real.I'm trusting you.Don't make me regret it. 
 They go together at the party 
 Elena:The duke party.I forgot.I hope they stay clear of the church. 
 Damon:Your hope, not mine. 
 Matt: Elena, hey. 
 Caroline:Elena, oh, my god.Where have you been? 
 Damon:Long story,no time to tell it. 
 Caroline:Wasn't talking to you. 
 Damon:Sure you were. 
 Matt:We haven't met.I'm matt. 
 Damon:Matt, there's a reason we haven't met.[He pushes Elena]You and I are 
 going that way. 
 Elena:Ahhh. I'm sorry,you guys. 
 At the Church , Stefan comes with a showel. 
 Stefan:Cleared the debris away.Set the torches like you asked.We can get down now. 
 Grams:What is that? 
 Stefan:It's everything I need to destroy them.

 Tyler:You're not Gilbert.I'm just asking question. 
 Jeremy:Dude, I don't get you, man. 
 Tyler:It's a party.You're a partier, ok?There's no need to psychoanalyze it. 
 Jeremy:I don't party anymore.And even if I did, it wouldn't be with you. 
 Tyler:No problem.Carry on just standing there, by yourself.All alone.The enemy of fun.Do you even have any friends? 
 [Tyler goes away and Anna comes] 
 Jeremy:Thanks god. 
 Anna:Weird hello, but ok.What's the matter? 
 Jeremy:Uh, nothin'.Nothing, just...It's nothin'. 
 Anna:Come on, let walk. 
 Back to the Church.Grams doing the spell. 
 Grams:Air.Earth.Fire. 
 Bonnie:Water. 
 Elena:That's it, just water from the tap? 
 Grams:As opposed to what? 
 Elena:I just figured maybit would have to be blessed Or mystical or something. 
 Stefan:What's that? 
 Damon:It's for katherine.Gotta have something to get her going.Unless your girl's 
 offering a vein to tap.Admit it-You can't wait to get rid of me. 
 Stefan:I can't wait to get rid of you. 
 Damon:Hmm. 
 Bonnie:You ready? 
 Back to Anna and Jeremy in the woods. 
 Anna:This place is wild. 
 Jeremy:You kinda like dead people, huh? 
 Anna:I'm strange, remember?You ok? 
 Jeremy:Yeah, yeah. Uh...This place makes me think about someone. 
 Anna:A dead someone? 
 Jeremy:No, no, just...Someone I used to know.So, uh, hey.We made it all of, what, 37 minutes in that party? 
 Anna:Not your scene? 
 Jeremy:No, I'm not really sure what my scene is anymore. 
 Anna:Hmm.

 Jeremy:Oh, uh...That's- that's a bummer. 
 Anna:Yeah? 
 Jeremy:Well,Yeah. 
 Anna:Guess this is good-bye. 
 Jeremy:I guess it is. 
 [Jeremy kiss her] 
 Jeremy:Anna, your face! 
 Anna:It's nothing. 
 Jeremy:It didn't look like nothing.

 Back to the party, Tyler's drinking beer , Matt's laying on a tree. 
 Tyler:Hey,Where's your date? 
 Matt:Who knows? 
 Tyler:Ah, is the honeymoon over already? 
 Matt:Maybe. 
 Tyler:After all that grief you gave me about liking her.I figured it would have lasted 
 longer than five minutes. 
 Matt:Look, I just- I don't know if I can do the whole public couple thing.She-she seems like she might be a little clingy. 
 Tyler:Well, good.I need my boy single anyway.Ooh.Incoming.

 Caroline:The hand thing with elena,It was lame.Well, I was lame.And, hey, your feelings for elena aside,Damon was there,And he was always such a jerk to me.And...I wanted to show off that I was with the good guy.So, anyway, I was lame.So...Forgiven? 
 Matt:Yeah, course.Yeah.

 Elena:Don't take her in.I'll bring the walls down. 
 Damon:You'll bring walls down if I don't. You think I trust you? 
 Grams:As much as I trust you. 
 Elena:Enough!Both of you.Look, he needs leverage.He needs to know that you're not going To shut the door when he gets inside.I get it.I'll go. 
 Damon:May I? 
 Outside Stefan tries to take the gasolin but Ben interrupt him. 
 Ben:Dark down there? 
 Stefan:I thought I told you to leave.

 Back to Stefan and Ben in the woods. 
 Stefan:Do you really think she cares about you hmm?You're disposable. 
 Ben:I don't care. She already gave me what I want. 
 Stefan:You're going to say "eternal life"?You're really that stupid? 
 Ben:You know,I've heard about you.You don't feed.You're not strong enough

 Bonnie:Damon took her inside. 
 Stefan:What?! 
 Grams:Stefan!If you go in there,you won't come out. 
 Stefan:What did you do? 
 Grams:Opening the door didn't remove the seal,It just opened the door. 
 Stefan:What's the seal? 
 Grams:Some seals keep vampires from entering.This one keeps them from...Coming out. 
 Stefan:Elena's human.She can leave.Anna and katherine can't.Damon can't.You weren't even planning on breaking the spell,Were you? 
 Grams:I told you.I will protect my own.Elena can get out.That's all that matters. 
 Back to Elena and Anna in the tomb. 
 Anna:You must have a taste for it.You scream and shriek and even bother to escape,But then you just come right back to it.[Elena steps on something]Mother!Your boyfriend did this, you know. 
 Elena:His father did. 
 Anna:And jonathan gilbert.Made a choice a long time agoThat it would be gilbert blood That brought her back to life.I had jeremy all ready to go,But... 
 [Elena screams when Anna bites her ,Stefan goes inside] 
 Bonnie:Stefan!You can't just leave him in there, grams! 
 Grams:He made his choice! 
 Bonnie:No.Here.[She tooks the grimoire]Just tell me what to do. I'll do it! 
 Grams:We are not strong enough.Even if we were able to bring the seal down,There's no guarantee that we can get it back up again. 
 Bonnie:You said it yourself-Many things can fuel a witch's power.Help me!Or I'll do it alone.
