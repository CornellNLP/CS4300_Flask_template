 [ FRENCH CLOWN ACADEMY ] 
 [Keeps speaking French] 
 Are you okay? 
 [Speaking French] 
 Oh, there's a thing. 
 [Whistle] 
 Man : [Speaking French] 
 You... want me to do something with the... 
 Handkerchief. 
 Um...

 Man : [Speaking French] 
 Monsieur. 
 Et? Jerry Lewis. 
 Monsieur. 
 [Speaking French] 
 Bye, Bouge. Are you gonna go to the... 
 Uh, listen,  monsieur,  I was hoping, like... 
 You could probably tell that I'm struggling in your class due to the fact that I don't speak French at all, um, and I was hoping that maybe you could tutor me clowning in English. 
 Because being a clown is the most important thing in the world to me. 
 Hello? 
 Bye. 
 [Speaking French] 
 Hi. Um, I'll have the number 57, please. 
 Sir, that's the price. 
 Oh, price. 
 Oh, in that case, I'll have the number 4. 
 A carrot? 
 Yes, a carrot, please. 
 Penelope, I'm so elated that you're here tonight with me. 
 [French accent] Oh, you know, free food. 
 Darling, listen to me. 
 I'm flunking out of clown school. 
 Things aren't going the way I planned. 
 They don't... I don't know, they don't... they don't get me here, I guess, and I... I think... [Sighs] Take a breath. 
 Sir, your carrot. 
 Thank you. 
 Penelope, I have a question to ask you. 
 Oh. Oh, no. Oh, no. 
 [Groans] So embarrassing. 
 Will you marry me? 
 Are you thinking about it? 
 [Speaks French] 
 Darling, listen to me. 
 I've run out of money. I kind of need to go home, but... 
 Where is home? 
 Bakersfield. 
 California, in the... In the sunshine state. 
 Okay. I marry you. 
 [Sighs] 
 Okay, look. 
 You must understand I don't love you. 
 I don't think you're very attractive. 
 But, uh, I want to go to America, get green card, but then when I maybe, uh, find a different guy that's better looking, I go with him and I leave you. 
 You're gonna love Bakersfield. 
 I'm sure I love it. 
 [Loud crunching] 
 [Clattering] 
 [Glass breaking] 
 It says here that you studied clowning at "dye clown France." 
 Yeah. 
 "Academy de clown francez." 
 That's correct, at the  académie de clown  in  Francois. 
 So, um, Chip, Chip, uh, Baskets? 
 Oh, my god. What a name for a clown. 
 That's my real name. That's my, uh... 
 Nah, you're Baskets the clown now, belly. 
 I have another clown name and I prefer to go by that, if you don't mind. 
 Okay. Well, what... What's your clown name? 
 My clown name is Renoir. 
 What? 
 Renoir. 
 Can't have no clown here named "rain-why." 
 You're Baskets. Baskets clown. 
 You know how many of you clowns end up in a basket? 
 That's the most perfect clown name I ever heard. 
 Great. 
 You're hired. 
 I am? 
 Sure. 
 Don't take nothin' to get hired around here other than walk in that door right there, tell me you're damn fool enough to want the job. 
 Thank you very much. 
 I don't pay enough. They all quit. 
 You'll quit, too. 
 I'll take it. 
 Okay. Care for a cup of coffee before you leave? 
 No, I'm okay. 
 That's what keeps them stands filled to the rafters. 
 Yeah. [Laughs] 
 Ain't nothing like a clown bein' hauled off unconscious. 
 That'll fill 'em up all weekend.

So he wanted to go to clown college, I said okay. Do you know how much that school was in Paris? I paid in Euros so I don't know exactly how much it was, but there were a lot of Euros on that check. He's always got to go to the bathroom. Whenever there is anything, he runs right in there. I hope he doesn't take all the toilet paper off the roll. I hate when he does that. But I have hundreds of rolls of toilet paper 'cause I've been to Costco. Here's Chip and his brother. Martha : Oh, are they twins? Yes, my first set of twins. Wow, you had more than one set of twins? I did. Wow. The other ones are right here. Mrs. Baskets : And they are something. He is a race car driver. He climbs Mt. Everest. Mrs. Baskets : They're gorgeous. They've got so many girlfriends. He's dating a model, I think. He runs through 'em like, you know, I run through cheese. Mrs. Baskets : You have a photo album of your family? Uh, not on me. Mm-hm. Well, who would carry it? Although, you do seem a little like a pack rat. Are you? A little. I get that vibe from you. Mrs. Baskets : Well, don't become a hoarder. Once you do that, you'll be on that show. And that's a picture of Ronald Reagan. Oh. Next to a picture of me. Oh, that's a good picture. And here are the twins when they were ski racers. Now, are the... Which twins are these? The adopted.
