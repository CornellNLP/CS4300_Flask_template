 Feel like a man.

But, Mom... Martha! Mom, shh. Hi, Mrs. Baskets. Hi. Hi, Chip. Is this your family? Yes. Hi. I'm Christine Baskets. What was that? Christine Baskets. Oh, hello. Hello. This is my mother Esther. Happy Halloween. Uh-huh. What did she say? Uh, nothing. And this is my son Chip. Hi, Chip. Hi, Chip. Hello Martha's parents Yes, Martha's parents! He has been sniffing around your mother for quite some time! Mother : Who is this woman? I don't know. Huh? She's, uh, my friend's mother. Mm-hmm. We should sit with you. No. No, we're here. We're good. We should sit together. Don't you love this idea? Yeah. We're practically related. That's a bad idea. It'll be fun. It's Easter. If we could just move it... Martha, help out a little. Okay. Sorry. Geez. Mom, want me to help you with that? We're new friends, and we'll get to know each other. Father : Oh, god! Martha : Dad, get up. Are these weighted? Oh, my goodness. Oh. You're right. Would it kill you to stand up, Mr. Brooks? I can't do this! Okay, Mother. Sorry Mom. I can't do this... Okay. Chip, I think you should sit here. Okay. [Whisper] Next to Martha. [Sigh] Thank you, Chip. Isn't he polite? He's my favorite. Don't tell the others. Ha ha ha! Oh. Can we get some water? Uhh. I can get you a cheese omelet or a ham omelet. Probably some bacon in that. I can get you huevos rancheros. That'll be cool. That sounds good. All right. I like your ponytail. My sister has a ponytail. Does she? Yeah. I was thinking about getting one, but I might look like my sister. You know what I mean? About what? I don't know. Can you just make my omelet, please? Yes. And here is your spicy medium... Uh, here you go. Thanks. Thank you. Cold peppers coming through. Huh. I wonder what happens to all this when it's over. Well, w're a mathadist, trough and throug... Catholic lite, I call it. Yeah, and what are you? Lutheran. Lutheran. Yeah. Lutheran. Mr. Brooks : I like the music especially. Oh, the music, yeah. Ha ha ha. Oh. I love your parents. Did I tell you that yet? Martha : They're pretty great. They're so sweet. I got to get out of here. What? I need to get out of here. Can you sit down for five minutes? I have been sitting down. Five minutes. Do you know what you did to me at the church? Do you know how much you embarrassed me? Can I just... I want to go pee. Flicking the lights off and on. Can I just go... What was that, morse code? I was trying to let you know something. Can I just go urinate, please? Easter. Please. Give me a little break. Ohh. Actually, can I... I really need to go to the bathroom, okay? He doesn't need to go to the bathroom. I do need to go to the... He doesn't. This is what he says all the time because... I don't know why. Maybe you could tell everybody why. Maybe you could give us a clue. Do you have a secret life? Honey, I... I don't understand. Are you going with this boy? No. Um, Chip's married. Shhh! Martha please! Married! Did he told you he is married? Shh! Martha, please... No. Um, Chip's he probably told you that so you'd quit sniffing around on him. Um... Well, actually, I am married. What? I am married! There's a lot of things you don't know about me, Mom. You're married? Yeah. What else can I tell you? I'm a smoker. I'm a smoker. What do you think about that? And I've been smoking since I was 37. Do you want to kill me on Easter Sunday? Is that what you're trying to do? I'm an adult, and I can do whatever I want. So this is me being an adult, okay? What's going on here? I don't know. I guess, uh, Chip's Mom didn't know that he married a lady he met in France, which I kind of spilled the beans on. France? Martha, please be quiet. She's French? French-Canadian? No. She's French-France. Oh, my god. Sorry, Chip. I goofed. Yeah, you did goof. But your whole life's a goof, you know? You've got your goof parents with you, too. Gosh. Just stop this. Just stop this. Just stop this. Stop this madness. Jesus, Chip. Excuse me, sir. You can't smoke in here. He's not going to smoke. Just give me one second, okay? Absolutely. You just can't smoke in here. There's no smoking. So sorry. What? Happy Easter, everybody. Mr. Brooks : Honey, how do you know these people? They're not always like this. I'm really sorry. He didn't get enough sleep last night. That's what you've been saying since he was a little baby. He jumps out of the playpen, and you say he needs sleep. Mrs. Brooks : But it's true. You have to get enough sleep. You really do. Do you know what will help all this? Martha : What? Let's get a dessert. It's not going to help any. It's not going to change anything. Je voudrais m'échapper. I would like to escape. Tu me manques, which translate to: You are beeing missed by me. Manquer : To miss Tu me manques: I miss you Je me souviens de la première fois que je vous ai vu. I remember the first time I saw you. Ma chérie means my dear. Mon amour, ma chérie Desire is longing, so to say "I long for you": Je te desire. I long for you. Hello, there, sir. How's your day going? Everything's good, thank you. Is there anything I can do to make your stay here more pleasant? Perhaps sign you up for a round of golf? A massage? Our masseuse Xavier works miracles. No, I'm okay. All right. Have a Happy Easter. Thank you. Oh, you should know there's a 900-pound lady making a ruckus at the buffet. It started when she was a teenager I would find these candy wrappers and what have you in her backpack. Mother. And when she was a freshman, she was poised to be the head of her cheerleading squad, but by the time she reached her junior year, that just went out the window. I sprained my ankle. Why do you think you sprained your ankle? It was all that new excess fat she had on her. I did everything I could. I made her write down everything she ate. We had willing Wensday, but somehow whe was always able to get it So that's why after a while I just gave up. I mean, she was so sensitive about it, and it was really, really sad because cheerleading meant everything to her. It's so sad. Well, eventually, she had to settle for that husband of hers. She was a piece of work. Then she just funneled all of her energy into motherhood, and you see how well that turned out. So the sugar just kept coming. Christine, sit down, honey. Eat your desserts. And this concludes our first lesson: Conversational French, the language of love. Next lesson will cover... Let me get that for you, baby. Thanks you very much See you at the next lesson Remember Keep practicing Au revoir, bye, good luck You okay? Yeah. You? I've been better. Not my favorite Easter brunch. My mother shamed me out of a dessert. [Rattling] I'm sorry that I didn't tell you about getting married. I'm sorry. It's all right. She nice? Hum... Good question. My life's in disarrey right now, Moma. [Coin clinks] Whose isn't? Whose isn't? [Coins clinking] Whoo-hoo! Whaah! Shut up. ♪♪ [Whistling] [With Neil Diamond on radio] ♪ Easter in Bakersfield ♪
