 Previously on "Eye Candy"... 
 Look who's here. 
 Tessa. 
 Someone is using Flirtual to stalk and kill people. 
 It was Sarah's birthday. 
 I gave it to her as a present. I'm sorry, Lindy. For which part? Lying about being a cop? I'm Ben. Or when you turned me in? Aah! He only wanted me to scare her. Who paid you? I don't know. That's not the way Babylon works. (Sirens wailing) ♪ ♪

♪ Aah! Babylon portal. Virtual city of illegal sites where anything and everything can be bought anonymously. (Tommy) People are selling their virginity, their internal organs, brokering murder, selling their own suicides. Yeager? We've tried to locate where this is run from, but it's untraceable. If we can get our hands on their user records, we'll have the identities of anyone who has ever bought or sold anything on a Babylon site. Including the Flirtual killer. Exactly. We know he purchased you on the Doll's house site, and Doll's House is hosted on the Babylon portal. One shop in a giant shopping mall. Which is why this footage of Kent is so important. He's a lead we can follow, the first that we can actually identify. This video originated on a self-mutilation website posted on the Babylon portal. What do we know about him? Kent was one of the top models in the world and became a photographer. He was all over the news a few weeks ago, said he was stabbed in the eye during a mugging. This guy's got a thing for prostitutes, drugs, and definitely likes to live life to the extreme. Why would he mutilate his eye if his eyes are his livelihood? I think someone made him do it. You stay and scour the Babylon portal for any other sign of Kent. You two, go talk to him. Let's go. Yeah? NYPD. I'm detective Calligan. We believe we may have a new lead on Mr. Kent's case. Any of these men look familiar? I'm sorry to make you relive it, but is there anything else you can remember about that night? It was so fast, I... The adrenaline kicked in and all I could focus on was the knife. Then he stabbed me. He took my watch and I lost my eye. A watch for an eye. Who are these men? We pulled footage from the security cameras in Riverside Park and matched them to anyone with a record of assault. Riverside Park? But that's not where I was mugged. It says right here, Riverside Park, 96th street. I was attacked on the east side. You think I'd forget a night that ended like this? I'm very sorry we wasted your time. I will do whatever I can to find this guy. Instead of bothering you again, I'll be e-mailing you some other suspects. That was quite a performance. Let's see if he takes the bait. Lindy's e-mailing him now. Kent opens it and we'll have total access to his computer. Good work. Find anything? Prostitution ads, lots of them. But until we get inside Kent's computer, we're not gonna know what he's bought on Babylon. Keep looking. I'm bored. (Sighing) Go write something. Doesn't it creep you out a bit that the killer hasn't killed anyone recently? No. Okay, yes, but I am trying to focus on other things. Okay, are you gonna tell me what's wrong or are you just gonna eat that pencil? It's Tessa, isn't it? Okay, she has been gone for two full days. Okay, no text, no note. Her phone goes straight to voice-mail. Gone? She just got here. I have to do something. Something drastic, something I have never done before. Ooh, like what? Call her parents. Hmm. Sarah? Looks like no one's home. I'm headed to your room. Okay, I'm here. Good. I'm sending you the picture. I need you to scan all my photos of Sarah, see if any of the faces match this ad. This is unbelievable. This picture of your sister wasn't tampered with, or photoshopped. Lindy... it's real. What? That means she's alive. No. I hope she is, but looking at the date and location embedded in this picture's metadata, it was taken in your hometown, three years ago. Sarah was using Babylon? What was she doing? Lindy, I think there's more to this picture. What do you mean? That res poly look a little off to you? I think there could be data hidden inside. Like a picture inside the picture? Yes. I'll use a stego tool. If there's something in there, I'll find it. It's a file. Someone saved a file in here. (Door closing) (Tessa) Hello? What was that? Hold on, someone's here. Don't tell Sophia about this yet. Sure. Hi, Georgie. Tessa. Hi. What are you doing here? Uh... All that computer stuff gives me anxiety. Uh, yeah, I know, just helping Linds with something. How long a something are we talking about? 'Cause I have a friend stopping by. A friend? A friend. Oh. That kind of a friend. Yeah. Right. I'll just be a second. You won't even notice I'm here. George? George, are you there? I just sent you the file. This is my case file. "Lindy Sampson, aka Magnifly." "First contact. Target." Hey, have you seen J.J.? Excuse me, do you know J.J.? I'm looking for... J.J., yeah. I got that. He told me to meet him here. Hmm. Nobody ever really meets J.J. I talked to him online and he said to come here. Did he? You're his group, right? The outliers. He said that you people could help me find my sister. Why would we help you? That's what you do. You're hacktivists. You help people when the system fails. You a cop? You totally seem like a cop. I'm not a cop. (Laughing) I'm not a cop. Oh, yeah? Prove it. You've got 30 seconds. To do what? I don't know. Impress me? Oh. 25 seconds. Okay. I see... You're on your own wireless network out of here that isn't broadcasting it's SSID, but it's called outlair. That's where you guys hide out for privacy. 10 seconds. (Clicking tongue) Time's up. Show and tell. That's me. Yup. The real me. After I figured out your network's name, I cracked the encryption, I saw your web traffic and sniffed out your session cookie, and then I signed on as you. George Reyes. Shh! Oh, and look at all the girls' photos I liked. What? (Chuckling) I didn't... no. I don't even... that's, uh... All right. Okay. So you have some small skill. What's your name? Magnifly. Pleasure to meet you, Magnifly. (Distant siren wailing) (Phone ringing) (Beeping) Catherine? I think I found our way in. (Phone ringing) Lindy, what did you find? The file is my case file. What? The Cyber Crimes Unit's case against me. It's redacted. I can't read it. The original file's on Catherine's computer. It's him, Lindy. He's playing with you and now you find your case file inside a picture of your sister? The killer did this. It's all his plan. So what do we do? We need to hack the Cyber Crimes Unit. Oh, I love it when you talk dirty to me. Okay, then. Gotta go. Lindy. (Gasping) Oh. You're back. It worked. Kent's opened the e-mail, we're on his computer. Coming? Sure. We can see and record everything he does. He's logging on to Babylon. There it is, a record of everything Kent's bought using the portal. He's going back through all the girls he bought. He deleted her. Edward Kent's ordered hundreds of girls using the Babylon portal. Why would he delete just that one? Find out who she is. Taking a screen grab. Using facial recognition to run it through the DMV. What's wrong with her eye? Eye for an eye. There's your motive. Eve Farmington. Go question her, now. Hey. You okay? Yeah, why? I don't know, you just seem distracted. I should stay here. Monitor if Kent does anything else on Babylon. Okay. (Phone ringing) Okay, I'm in position. Okay, give me a few minutes. May I have a word? Just wanted to talk. We haven't checked in for a while. Okay. You know, I'm impressed with the work that you've been doing for us and I don't impress easily. Thank you. Mm-hmm. I'm learning so much I didn't know. We should talk about how to make your place here more... Official. (Chuckling) (Alarm sounding) Okay, people, not sure what that is, but we gotta move it out. Come on, let's go. Move, move, move. (Beeping) Lindy, where are you? (Beeping) It worked. I'm inside. (Indistinct radio chatter) Here we go. I'm gonna grab her password hash from memory and try and crack it. Gas company says they're sweeping the building. They'll have it fixed in the next half hour, 45 minutes tops. Thanks. I couldn't have done it without you. Aww, that's sweet. And very true, Linds, very true. Any luck breaking her password? Just need a little more time. Excuse me. Can I help you? You think I did this to him? Looks like he did it to himself. We know you were on Babylon. That was years ago. Edward Kent paid for your services and then you stopped. Why? I was bored and stupid. A friend told me about this place online, Babylon, where you could sell anything. I was making a lot of money living the New York dream, until he bought me. I thought it was for s*x, but he was into something else. Woke up in the hospital two days later. He had hit me so hard that the doctors couldn't save my eye. Why didn't you go to the police? And say what? There's no justice for girls like me, right, detective? Look, I didn't do this to Kent, as much as he deserved it. We're trying to shut the Babylon portal down, Eve. Help us. Shut Babylon down? You can't shut Babylon down. I'm sorry, I can't help you. She's lying. Who's she lying to protect? Not Kent. Who else has access to Kent's computer? His assistant, Luca. Kent sent her to the hospital, there should be a record of it. Under what name? She changed her name. I'm not searching under her name, I'm searching under Luca's. Look. Luca Marino brought a woman to the hospital the night Eve was beaten. Jennifer Marino. His sister. It worked. You're up. Yes! All right, just escalate my privileges. Bypassing the file decryption, and... bam, ba-ba-bam! I'm in. (Laughing) Thank you, George. Looks safe. They had me under surveillance? What? Lindy Sampson. She's perfect. That's what you said about the others. She's different. She's talented, pragmatic, creative. Dropped out of MIT but during her first and only semester, she ranked top of her class. And she's guilty of several illegal acts of hacktivism. Just the type to catch Bubonic's attention. See, that's the best part. She already has. She knows him under the alias J.J., the leader of a group of hacktivists called the outliers. They're just a bunch of kids. They don't even know who they're working for. What do you propose? I'll go undercover. Meet Lindy, become part of her life. And when Bubonic does recruit her, I'll be there. This is a bad idea. Why? Because we're using her without her knowing, Tommy. Calligan, I'm granting your request to go undercover. Am I the only one that remembers what happened last time we tried to turn someone against Bubonic? She ended up dead. Bubonic's a murderer and a terrorist. I don't care how we catch him as long as we do, and soon. Catherine, you are making a mistake. You know what's not a mistake? Me standing on this side of the desk. Run the operation, back Tommy up and maybe, just maybe, we'll finally catch Bubonic. Thank you, detectives. They were using me. What? All along. It was Bubonic, George. I was Tommy's whole plan to catch him. Oh, man. That's tough, Linds.

I need you to just be there for me right now. Not ask so many questions. Okay. You would tell me if something really bad was going on though, right? Of course. My God. Who's the ginger? A friend of a friend. Oh. He looks like he's your friend now. (Laughing) (Indistinct radio chatter) There's something else. It's a number. What kind of number? It's a file number. (Phone ringing) Hello? You're getting warmer, Lindy. Why are you doing this? They don't love you. Not like I do. Hello? George, it was him. What are you calling me on? The killer led me down here, left me a phone to find. Can you trace it? Yeah, I... I guess, I... It's just gonna take some time. Oh, I'm sorry, Mr. Kent is out. It's not him we want to see. We spoke to Jennifer Marino. I'm sorry? I don't understand. I don't know who that is. Yes, you do. Only now she calls herself Eve Farmington. You drove her to the hospital after Kent beat her and then a week later, you were working for him. We saw her face, Luca. An eye for an eye. You finally got the justice for your sister. We can get a warrant and search your hard drive in an hour. Are you really gonna tell us that when we do, we're not gonna find a trail to Babylon? He had to be held accountable. Babylon sells a lot of things, girls, murder, revenge. Making Kent gouge his eye out using the site he first used to buy my sister seemed like the only fair punishment. Is that why it took you two years to make Kent pay for what he did? First, I had to find the proper leverage. And what'd you find? He bought lots of them. Recorded what he did to them, watched it over and over. You should be arresting him, not me. We intend to. But it doesn't have to be that way for you. Not if you help us find whoever's behind Babylon. Nobody knows who runs that site. We know you pay them in bitcoin. Give us Babylon's bitcoin wallet, and maybe I'll speak to the DA about a deal.

But you can give me your phone number. Bye. I know you're upset. I'm not upset, I'm angry. Why would you do that? Because I don't trust you. What, with her? You know you have no heart to push this.

Well, I hope you're right, man. I think I can do a better job than you can. Well, I hope you're right, man. All right, thanks. (Phone ringing) Lindy. I just talked to the gas techs. They're doing a final sweep of the building. They're heading down to the basement. What about the call trace? Wh... it... it's almost done, just get out of there now... (Beeping) (Beeping) (Giggling) You never take this off, even in the shower. My, uh, my dad gave it to me. Christopher, patron Saint of protection. It's a catholic thing. I know the catholic thing.

They were listening... To everything. "L. Sampson: Where are you taking me?" "Let go of me. Let go of me." Let go of me! Sorry to drag you down here. J.J.? Not exactly. You're Bubonic. I'm sorry for the theatrics. I'm sure you can appreciate from my reputation, I need to stay, uh, hidden. What do you want? I thought we could work together. We should work together. I've been hired to steal a valuable portfolio of identities. I need you to design the crimeware kit and install it on the servers of Lodestone Shipping Company. Why me? Why not somebody else? 'Cause I've been watching you and you're the best. This contract deserves the best. You used to be an activist. Now you're a murderer and a thief, and I'd never work for you. Are you sure? What if I told you the people who hired me have information about your sister. What? Oh, isn't that what fills your days? What you've been searching for? What do they know about my sister? They won't tell me, but it's how they want to pay you. So, will you do it? Yes, I'll do it. But it's how they want to pay you. So, will you do it? Yes, I'll do it. (Beeping) (Knocking at door) (Distant sirens wailing) (Knocking at door) Lindy. What are you doing here? Lindy Sampson, you're being charged with four counts of violating the computer fraud and abuse act for crimes related to your activities as a hacktivist. You have the right to remain silent. Anything you say can and... You're a cop? (Phone ringing) Lindy, listen to me. I traced the call. It's him. He's inside the Cyber Crimes Unit. The killer is with you, Lindy. You have to get out! (Door rattling) Lindy! Lindy! Hello, Lindy. It's so good to see you. Have you figured it out yet? Why are you doing this? You had to find out for yourself. They're all liars, Lindy. Even him. State your name for the record. Detective Benjamin Miller. So much loss, so much pain. He would've done anything to protect you. Everybody has a limit, Catherine. Setting Lindy Sampson up to take the fall, that's my limit. If you hadn't interfered, Lindy would have made the deal and Bubonic would be in prison. Bubonic is a psychopath. You don't know what he would have done to her. You went against my orders and then fell in love with her. You compromised this whole operation. Lodestone Shipping. You were the client who contracted out to Bubonic. You couldn't get to him so you used Lindy. And your point? Then you pretended to have information about her sister so she'd actually go through with it. Who said I was pretending? You know about this? Yes. Well, so much for never letting anything happen to her, Tommy. Yeah. So much for staying neutral. For God's sake, Catherine, if you have information about that girl's sister, you have to let her know. Do I? You want to suspend me, fine. But I'm done talking. And I don't regret anything. Hey. What are you doing here? Whoa, whoa. We have a solid lead on the Babylon portal. We're going to find the host and maybe catch the killer. What's wrong? You lied to me. What are you talking about? Get away from me. Lindy. You lied. You and Catherine, you tried to set me up, but Ben arrested me to save me, from the two of you. Okay, let's just talk this through, all right? You used me to get to Bubonic. You used my sister. Lindy, you have to understand, that was before I really knew you. What do you know about Sarah? Tell me! Catherine found a case. A man who abducted girls. She thought maybe your sister might have been a part of it. She refuses to say anything about it. You and me, this... whatever this is... it's over. It's done. I'm sorry, I can't. Are you sure? Connor's here, I thought, you know, we could all go out. I'm sorry, I... Already made plans. Plans, like a date? Mm, maybe. With the guy from today? No. Another one? Someone better. Um... Look, I'll tell you everything later. Gotta go. Tessa is on another date. Obviously, I trust your taste in friends, but that girl is a lot of work. She's up to something. Wait. I just remembered. That red-hot ginger freak that Tessa was devouring, I know where he's from. That night you signed Lindy up, he was one of the guys she matched with on Flirtual. See, my perfect social memory strikes again. Coincidences happen. Give me your phone. Why? Just give it to me. Okay. Searching for women. That's a first since high school. With blonde hair in Williamsburg. Wait, isn't that... Lindy's jacket. And she's dating Lindy's matches. (Phone ringing) Here we go again. That giddy excitement and anticipation. Only this time, I already know you're not the one. You're the imposter, the knockoff, the fake. Hi. I'm Tessa. You want a drink?
