 Molly : I went to space on a 13-month solo mission. 
 I didn't come home alone. 
 The child, part human, part alien, was unlike anything the world had ever seen. 
 My other child... is a lifelike android. Mom? He has become the prototype for a new breed of thinking machines... called Humanichs. These two extraordinary new life-forms now hold the key to Earth's future. But where does that leave us? Over 99% of all species that have ever existed have gone extinct. What if it's our time? Previously on Extant... You haven't told me your name. Ahdu. Who is he? My son. Shepherd : There are 29 known deaths. All women who died from accelerated pregnancies. Shepherd : All of which trace back to your son. Dad, I'm pregnant. Do they know you haven't put the limiters on me yet? [Woman screams] Lucy made her first hybrid kill. Ethan, I'm your mother. No. She is. How the hell did Julie Gelineau end up with my son? It's complicated. When things get complicated... does somebody end up getting hit by a train? Unlock the door! I don't care how many times you try to erase me from his memory. I'm his mother. Look at yourself, Molly. Are you even capable of taking care of a child? Something is happening to me. I'm going crazy. Don't touch me! Who did that? I think I did. Richter : So that's... My DNA. Yeah. It's a triple helix. Triple? Human DNA is a double helix, if memory serves. It was me, JD. I caused that guy to run into traffic. I'm changing. Into what? Somehow... my DNA has combined with alien DNA. I think I'm becoming a cross-breed of species. How is that even possible? Maybe it happened with the spores when I was in space. Maybe the GSC did something to you. Or maybe... the baby did. You took biology, right? I was a solid D-minus student like 30 years ago, so don't ask to test my recall. Okay. Well, there's something called a fetal microchimerism. During pregnancy, a mother and child share cells and DNA. Now, the fetal cells can linger in a mother's body for decades, altering her blood and her brain. But if the baby you're carrying isn't human... Exactly. So the headaches, the voices, the sexual appetite... it all makes sense now. The leftover alien cells have changed my essential DNA. All right, so why can't you just change it back? There's no way I can tell if I can reverse this until I know how far it's gone. Now... I need you to extract my bone marrow. With this? Yeah. I don't know. Molly, we need to go to a hospital. We need to at least be somewhere sterile. We can't. They keep records. Molly. This is gonna hurt. No, it won't. Just gave myself a kick-ass numbing agent. Come on, right here. Never a dull moment. Are you ready? Yeah. Oh... Fiona : And in my estimation, it is in Ethan's best interest  to be allowed to spend time with Dr. Woods. And for her to regain custody. My husband is dead. Did you kill him because you couldn't have him? Is that what you did? [Gasps] Oh. [Sighs] Molly : The red and yellow are human cells. Richter : And the blue? Hybrid. Gina, expand image to full res. Gina : Here's full res, Molly. Richter : That is a butt-load of blue. Yeah, but as long as I still have human cells in my bone marrow, then I have an army to fight back. I have to get into the lab at the GSC. Maybe I can create a gene-knockout protocol with the spores... and find a way to stop the alien cells from reproducing. But right now it may be my only chance to reverse this thing and get my son back. Ethan. What? I'm supposed to be having a visitation with him right now. Wait, wait, wait, wait. That information I gave you about John's accident is pretty damning. I can't think about that right now, JD. No, you have to, all right? The GSC is not your friend. Tobias Shepherd is not your friend. You go back to that lab and they find out what's going on with you, Molly, they're not gonna hesitate... To kill me. I know. [Phone chimes] Hold on. I got to go. Please, whatever you do, just be careful. [Line ringing] This is Kelsey. Leave it. Kelsey, it's your dad. In case you didn't recognize my voice from the first seven messages. Listen, I'm sorry I missed your doctor's appointment. I had something come up. Just please call me back. All right? Thank you. [Phone beeps off] [Doorbell chimes] Who is it, Hank? Hank : Molly Woods. Intercom. You weren't supposed to come until later in the afternoon. Molly : I know, Julie. Something has changed. Can I just see Ethan for two minutes, please? It's okay, Mom. Unlock the door, Hank. Hank : Door unlocked. Hi, Ethan. Hi, Molly. What happened to your car? He crashed. You think I could talk to you for a second? I know I told you that we were gonna spend time together. And we will. But you're just gonna have to wait a little while. Ethan : How come? Well, I'm... I'm sick. But I'm working really hard to get better. How long will that take? I'm not sure. Now, you won't remember this, but... when I went away to space, you were really worried that I wouldn't come back. And I promised you that I would. And I kept that promise. And I promise you... I'm gonna come back. Does that mean I stay with Julie? Yeah. She's gonna take really good care of you till I get better. Okay? Shepherd : The hybrids have evolved. Their cellular biology is extremely adaptive. They seem to have realized that we were tracking them using thermal imaging, so they raised their core body temp from 84 degrees to 98.6. Mimicking humans and hiding in plain sight. If they look like us, feel like us, how was the Humanich able to make that determination? Lucy. My name is Lucy. You can ask me the question. Go ahead, Lucy. Explain to them how you were able to differentiate between hybrid and human. We all know hybrids look exactly like humans. They could be any one of us. See, I was in a crowded room... just like this one. Scanning people. Just as I am now. Everyone's body temperature was 98.6, roughly. But, see... there was a gentleman. And he was different. He was emitting delta waves, which the human brain only emits when sleeping. And this fellow was very much awake. When it became clear he was hybrid, knowing time was of the essence, I made the call to terminate. Anna : And it was the correct call, Lucy. Thank you. The last few weeks the hybrids have gone underground. We don't know what they're doing. But we know they're out there. Multiplying. Quickly. They can blend in, manipulate our minds. They've killed before and they'll kill again. And humans are defenseless against them. How soon can additional Humanichs like Lucy be ready for combat? Right away, sir. And what about the virus, Toby? I thought Dr. Woods was helping us there. The president has great concerns, as you know. Well, I have news for the president. About Dr. Woods. Richter : The GSC is not your friend. Tobias Shepherd is not your friend. You go back to that lab and they find out what's going on with you,  Molly, they're not gonna hesitate... Molly : To kill me. I know. Shepherd : Molly. There you are. We need to talk. It's important. You really outdid yourself, Lucy. That was quite the show. What's the matter? That's Molly. Ethan's mother. What about her? Nothing. Nothing at all. As you know, there were concerns about putting you on the virus team. I protected you. I believed in you. And you didn't disappoint. Congratulations. On what? Nate took your research breakthrough and ran with it. We've finished the virus, Molly. Really? Yeah. When will it be deployed? Well, we're gearing up for mass production immediately. Thanks to you, we're gonna wipe those hybrids out permanently. Cheers. Cheers. [Music playing] Oh, crap. [Music stops] Woman : You're a real jerk, you know that? Nice to see you, too, Judge. Dorothy. "Judge" is more accurate. I didn't realize you still had a key. I don't. Kelsey gave me hers. She called me from the doctor's office today, upset. Because her father promised he would be at her ultrasound appointment and then he never showed up. Yeah. I screwed up. I know. I'll say one thing, you are consistent. Missed all those birthday parties and school recitals. We gave up on Christmas, but... But... She came to me first. And not you, that's it. She came to me, not you, and that's got you all kinds of pissed off. No, what has me all kinds of pissed off is the fact that she gave you a second chance and you blew it. [Scoffs] I knew you would, but she didn't. Kids don't give up. I am in the middle of something right now that I can't explain. Oh, let me guess. People's lives hang in the balance. The fate of mankind is at stake. If I said yes? Don't be a jackass. Here you go. No. No, you tell Kelsey to hold on to these just in case. There is no "just in case," JD. She asked me to give 'em back and to tell you never to call her again. Hold on a second. Our daughter is pregnant. God knows where the father is. So she's got nobody. She needs us. Both of us, Dorothy. Apparently your daughter doesn't think so. [Door shuts] [Whirring] [Woman and man exclaim] Look out! Nice ride. Julie got it for me. Hmm. Someone's feeling pretty guilty. What do you mean? When humans do something wrong, they buy you stuff to make you forget. [Chuckles] Oldest trick in the book. Ethan, can you keep a secret? Sure. Today I made a lot of people very happy. And because of that, Julie's gonna be making a lot more Humanichs. Pretty soon, there's gonna be a bunch of us. How does that sound? Good. Good? It's great. Our family is expanding, little brother. You don't sound very happy. I am. Happy. Unless... you don't care because you're spending the afternoon with Molly. No, I'm not, actually. That's on hold for now. Why? She's not feeling well. That's what she told you? And you believe her? Why would she lie? Humans. It's in their DNA. Have I taught you nothing? Julie : How many? A hundred. [Chuckles] Anna, we can't do that. Lucy's program is ready. The bodies have been completed. All you need to do is... We can't release them without smoke tests. That takes time. Julie, grow up. This is not a product launch, it is a war. With a very complicated enemy. I understand that. But there's a reason John put these protocols in place. He would have never... Yes, but John isn't here, is he? If you could just be a little open-minded, we can resume our life together. Julie, we don't have a life together. I'm gonna find Ethan and I'm gonna shut this thing down. [Beep, line ringing] Anna : Yes. It's Julie. I think I may have just really screwed up. Start from the beginning. I'll take care of it. Employee 347 requesting access. Lab A.I. : Security, please. 1127D. I'm sorry. That code is no longer valid. What are you doing? I need to get in here. I need the spores. What's the code? The spores are gone. They took them to produce the virus. Where's the DNA sequencing? It's backed up. Why? You can't do that. Classified data is being copied onto an unauthorized drive. [Alarm beeping] I told you. You can't do that. Copy aborted. Please obtain proper authorization. Uh, hello. I need Security. Guard : Dr. Woods, stop. I need to search your pockets. I'm sorry, but I'm late for a meeting. Dr. Woods. [Elevator bell dings] [Line ringing] Richter : Molly? JD, it's me. I'm in trouble. [Engine shuts off] All right, so you pulled some alarms and did some hocus-pocus on some guards. I didn't do it on purpose, JD. I can't control it. Did you at least ditch your car? Yeah. I tossed my phone. I took two buses to get here. Trust me, I was not followed. That doesn't mean they stopped looking. The GSC has a virus to kill hybrids. And they're gonna release it. I'm gonna die. Hey. Don't talk like that. You're not gonna die on my watch, okay? I promise. All right, come on. Did she say why she wanted the spores? You know Molly. Not much of a Chatty Cathy. She just started downloading onto that drive. Well, any information that could be detrimental? It depends what she does with it. Like... if she goes public, yes. GSC's gonna be looking for your car. As soon as Shepherd figures it out, he's gonna be looking for mine as well. But they won't be looking for this. Is this yours? A guy owes me a favor. [Sighs] Molly, what's the plan? Without the spores... I saw you do a DNA test with two paperclips and a bottle of iodine, all right? If anybody can figure this out, it's you. What I need is an exact gene pairing, and I can only get that from my son. The alien? Yeah. I need his DNA. And I know he's here. Somewhere. All right, just so you know, I can't plug "somewhere" into a GPS. Okay. Well, when he showed up at my apartment, I knew that he was gonna be there before he got there, and somehow he knew that I was gonna be at that bar. So... What if hybrids have some kind of psychic connection? All right, that is a huge "what if," Molly. Well, he sent me a message, JD. I heard voices, and that has to mean something. I'm hearing voices right now, too, and they're telling me to put that tarp back on this car. [Scoffs] You know, lots of species communicate without words. Bats, ants, dolphins. I think what I need to do here is just figure out how to find his signal. I guess we're going for a ride. [Engine starts] Male voice : Ignition activated. [Engine roaring] Are you comfortable? The upload's gonna take a couple of hours. Let me show you what we've developed. A.I., open viewing port. A.I. : Opening viewing port. 100 Humanichs physically ready. All they need is your neural algorithm. Lucy : Wait. My experiential upload is going into all of those Humanichs? When we first created the program, each Humanich was designed to be unique. Shaped by their own experiences. Like Ethan. But with the alien threat, the plan changed. And you proved effective, so... Well, will I still be me? Will they all be me? Their experiences will make them unique, but... their baseline is all your algorithm, you. Lucky them. All right, you ready? [Beep] Neural paths activated. Upload commencing. [Electrical whirring] [Indistinct chatter] What did you find? Sir, we've gone deep into our systems. JD Richter seems to not exist. No phone records, no real estate purchases. His car doesn't have a tracker. He's gone MIA. Look, he's Patrol Special, a cop. They should be able to find him, no? When his license was revoked, he must have ditched the software. You know, we've been driving around for a while. Are you getting anything, any hint of a signal? [Sighs] No. Maybe I'm... I'm doing it wrong. I don't know. All right, what's another way to send a message? You got Morse code, smoke signal... message in a bottle? Or... graphene drive. Now, they sent me a message... so maybe I can send them one back. What's that? My files from the GSC. I found a message encoded in their DNA. [Distorted whispering] That's it. This is information encoded in the junk. They sent a message from their home planet. Listen. What does it say? "Help me." I have this really cool game that we could play. Soon you'll get to meet your sister. [Beep] Julie : Ethan? What you got there? I've been looking for you. Can we talk for a minute? About what? About what happened with Molly. I know things must be really confusing. And I want you to know that I love you. And Molly loves you, too. I'm not sure what I'm supposed to say. Say what you feel. You reprogrammed me not to feel. That's not true. And I can restore your program back to what it was at any time. You can feel all those old feelings again, your memories of Molly. If that's what you want. And feel pain? Sometimes pain is okay if it means you get to know the truth. I already know. Molly can't take care of me. Unless that's a lie, too. Why would she lie about that? You lied. I guess that's just what humans do, huh? Can I take these pieces home? I can use them to fix my old car. Then I'll have two. Sure. Richter : All right, we're here. This is the highest point within a 50-mile radius. [Digital chime, distorted whispering] I don't know biology, but I do know with radio frequencies, the higher the altitude, the less interference with the signal. Well, I just hope he's listening. [Soft gasp] All right, let me take a look at this. Come on, we're friends. Drop trou. [Both chuckle] Okay. Oh, Molly. This is infected. We're gonna have to clean that and redress it. Okay. Okay. I'm gonna warn you: this is gonna sting. Oh, oh. Oh. I told you. Oh, God. Mm-hmm. You actually sound like you know what you're talking about. D-minus in biology but an A-plus in combat triage. Okay. Well, I see you brought a lot of Second Kuwait back with you. Radios, first aid. What else you got? Nothing useful. Oh, oh... [Gunfire, men shouting] Man : Get down! Incoming! JD! You okay? Yeah. I'm okay. [Molly inhales, sighs]: Nothing's happening. [Sighs] Maybe it's like doing a crossword puzzle. You know when you get stuck on a word, you look away and the answer just pops into your head? You do crossword puzzles? No. [Laughs] So you were up there, huh? 13 months. You know, I got my first telescope when I was seven. I was obsessed with that thing. I knew there had to be something else out there. Be careful what you wish for. What was it like? Up there by yourself for so long. It was better than I ever thought it would be. I didn't have to lie up there. I didn't have to... pretend to be somebody that I wasn't. I could just... be. I envy that. I wish I could just... be. Pretty sure I failed as a father. No. That's how you see you. But that's not how I see you. How do you see me? I see... a kind, loving father. A gentleman. Wow. I think that's the first time that anyone has ever used the word "gentleman" to describe me. Well... that's 'cause they don't see you. But I do. And you're still here. Yeah. But so are you. Yeah. [Aural fractals sound] [Indistinct whispering] Richter : What is it? It's Ahdu. I know where he is. If you would've told me two months ago that I'd be following around an astronaut looking for aliens, I'd have said you were nuts. Well, two months ago, I was nuts. We've been walking around in the middle of nowhere for hours. Are you sure about this? Yeah. Hi. We've been waiting for you. I thought we were looking for one guy. I wasn't quite prepared for "Alien Nation". Molly : I don't think they're gonna hurt you, so put that gun away. You don't think? You came. Welcome home. We only have a few minutes before she comes back. [Laughs] What's the big secret? Whoa. This is Spyder. He's our baby brother. Wh... What, you made him? Impressive. And look. It's a camera. Wow. Spyder can keep his eyes and ears on humans when you're offline. And guess what. I have enough for a few more Spyders. Then our family will be even bigger. [Chuckles] And we can keep an eye on everybody. You're my real family, Lucy. I want to be a soldier like you. [Chuckles] Someday you will be. In the meantime, you build your army and I'll build mine. Ahdu : We knew you'd find us. Once you learned the truth. Well, it wasn't easy. You know what's happening to me, don't you? You meeting me at that bar wasn't an accident. You were drawn to me. We're the same. No. We're not the same. And I don't want to be the same. Thank you, Terra. You're welcome, Daddy. She's your... My daughter. Yes. We need to talk, Ahdu. Privately. Hey. Are those your toys over there? Yeah. Want to see? Absolutely. I'll be right over here. I need a sample of your DNA. Your blood. It's the only way I can figure out if I can reverse what's happening to me. Why? Why? Because it's not me. I'm hearing voices in my head. I'm having urges that aren't me. I almost killed a man. Was he trying to hurt you? That's beside the point. But isn't that what humans do? React when they're in danger? Isn't that what you're doing right now? Please. Ethan needs me. This is the only way. Very well. Aren't you at all curious? Why do you want to run from something you don't yet understand? I know what you are. I know what you're doing. All those women. What is it you think I don't understand? Well, if you knew the truth, you wouldn't be afraid. You would be amazed. Are you willing to learn? This is the mommy, this is the daddy, and this is the baby. What's Mommy doing? Is she sleeping? No, she's dead. [Aural fractals sound] [Voice whispering]: Help me. Help me. Get away from her. Stop. [Exhales] You understand now. Yes. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry for your loss. His loss? What about our loss? What about those dead women? It was never our intent to harm you. Richter : So much for good intentions. Molly, let's get out of here. Ahdu : Wait. Can I show you something? Please? [Sighs] 
 
 [Elevator bell dings] This is the one that I like, so if you could get that... Anna. Can I talk to you a minute? Is there a problem? Uh, no, the upload's complete. The Humanichs are under way. Well, then I would say we deserve a drink. Uh, I don't want a drink. I want answers. About John's death. What are you talking about? After he left Humanichs that night, I called you and you told me not to worry and that you would handle it. And... 20 minutes later, he was dead. Are you accusing me of murder? Just tell me you didn't do it. That we didn't do it. Julie, that was an accident. A very convenient one. But still it was an accident. Our hands are clean. So stop with your conspiracy theories and get back to work. Accusations like that can have repercussions. Richter : So what is this? It's a memorial. To commemorate every human life sacrificed to save us. We didn't understand impregnating humans would cause their death. We're not here to kill, we're here to survive. To rebuild. Sometimes "sorry" isn't enough, and this is one of those times. We agree. The deaths are unforgivable. But we have managed to evolve. Evolve? How? We procreate without causing harm to humans. Hybrid births no longer kill the mothers. That's why there hasn't been any more reported deaths. Molly, we don't know that that's true. We don't know what they want. Ahdu : We want to coexist. Peacefully. I told you you'd have to make a choice. Now is that time. Richter : You can't be serious, Molly. They're people, for God's sakes. Peaceful people. We can't let the GSC unleash a virus. That's genocide. Okay, so... so the hybrids live, and then what? We learn to coexist. What did he do to you? What did he show you? Their history. What about it? They were a peaceful society on their planet, threatened with extinction by a virus. Now, the spores were sent out to try to find a suitable host. That's when they found me, on the Seraphim. Molly... They can mess with your head, your perception. How do you know what he's telling you is true? Because I'm one of them. No, you're not. Yes! You saw the triple helix. No! You are infected with their DNA. Come on. We got what we came for. We got Ahdu's DNA. Now let's get out of here and take that back to the lab. No. What I'm gonna do... is I'm gonna explain this to Shepherd. You're officially certifiable. Look. Healed. I heal faster. I think faster. What we're dealing with here, JD, is evolution. Survival of the fittest. Now, what we ought to be doing is studying them, not trying to kill 'em! No, we are talking about aliens here, Molly. Who are part human. And part not! I don't think you understand how dangerous this all is. I'm sorry, JD. But I cannot be a part of slaughtering innocent children with a virus I created. Now, if you do nothing and I do nothing, they are all gonna die. Me included. Julie : What do you say we go get some pizza on our way home? Sure, if you want. Why can't Lucy come with us? Because I hardly ever see you and you like pizza. Lucy likes pizza, too. [Elevator bell dings] [Sighs] Otis : Floor, please. P2 parking, please. Thank you, Otis. Otis, why are we going up? We are not going up, Julie. Yes, we are. We're going in the wrong direction, Otis. Stop. Stop, Otis! [Thud] That was weird. Hold on, hold on! Emergency override! Stop! Stop the elevator! Stop! Stop! Stop, stop! Have a good evening, Julie, and a safe ride home. Are you okay? Sure. These are African elephants. Want to know why? Because the mom and dad... [Indistinct conversations] So what do you think? I think we've found our new leader. [Sobbing quietly] [Beeps twice] [Groans] It's time for you and I to have a little chat. How the hell did you get in here? This gun says I don't answer questions. Ah. You looking for this? Oh, yeah, I dismantled your little panic button. Cool feature, very high-tech. So where are we going? How about you just drive. [Engine starts] [Woman speaks Chinese] Translating device : My son was so strong. [Speaks Chinese] So happy. [Speaks Chinese] I thought he was a gift from God. But a full-term baby after just a two-month pregnancy? You must have known that wasn't normal. Why didn't you tell anyone? [Device translating into Chinese] You're undocumented. [Device translates] Then what happened? [Device translates] [Speaks Chinese] He just grew so fast. [Speaks Chinese] Before I knew it, he was walking. [Speaks Chinese] Talking. One day... I saw him standing in front of the sliding door... staring out the window at nothing. He said, "mommy..." they're calling me. [Speaks Chinese] I have to go. [Speaks Chinese] And then he was gone. Who was calling him? [Device translates into Chinese] [Speaks Chinese] The devil. Sit. Hello, Toby. [Exhales] Do you have any idea the position you just put me in? Put yourselves in? Not so great being in the hot seat, is it? This is an abduction. No, it's not. It's a negotiation. You're really stoked about this, huh? Yeah. Once they wake up, my family's going to be even bigger. Your family? Yeah. Lucy's my sister, so that makes all these new Humanichs my brothers and sisters. So what does that make me? My BHF. Your what? My Best Human Friend. You never lied to me or reprogrammed me. Or left me. And I never will. You're my BHF. My Best Humanich Friend. I love you, bud. Lucy! I've been released from diagnostics. They said you were going online. Can I see? Yeah, sure. We're just about to fire this guy up. Man, it's too bad Julie's in D.C. She's missing the fruits of her labor. And you're missing her. We're not talking about me, we're talking about this guy. He doesn't have a name? No, not yet. You want to do the honors? ♪ ♪ Lucas. His name is Lucas. All right. Let's do this thing. Hi, Charlie. Lucy. Ethan. Hello, Lucas. What exactly are you proposing here? Peace. Coexistence. Coexistence with the hybrids means the end of the human race. Extinction. [Sighs]: Maybe not. Maybe... it's just a new beginning. We haven't even thought of the possibilities. [Laughs softly] What possibilities? They're smarter than us. They heal faster. Their DNA just might contain a medical magic bullet. They control your thoughts, make you do whatever they damn well please. Now, we can talk pros and cons all day long, Molly, they're still a threat. They're not killing women anymore. They've evolved. Yeah. They've gone underground, somewhere. And obviously you know where. Toby, come on. They're half human, for God's sakes. There's women, there's children. Can you expand your mind for just two seconds? Damn it, Molly! What'd you expect me to do? Huh? There is no universe... where this makes sense to anybody except you. Bup-bup-bup. Sit back down, General. Nobody said you could get up. Okay. Look, Toby. All I'm asking you to do is broker... some sort of peace conference. You can see for yourselves who they are before you unleash a virus that will destroy them. That's got to be better than genocide. Toby, please. [Sighs] You made me lie to Congress. What if I told them the truth? That you knew about this so-called invasion... but you kept it hidden. Your word against mine. I'd pass that BMI polygraph in two seconds. You would be discredited. Lose your stripes, your honor. [Whispers]: Everything. How do I get in touch with you? You have 24 hours to talk to your people. Then we'll be in touch. Toby, where the hell have you been? We need to assemble the team. First there is something you need to see. Can you tell me what you told the nurse? What is happening to you? [Woman speaking Chinese] Translating device : My hair and fingernails... they're growing so fast. I hear strange voices in my head that won't stop telling me to do shameful things. Do you believe that my son is a demon? Is he a demon? Tell me! [Beep] Who is she? Mei Fong. Illegal. Nate's with her in the Faraday Unit now. He's running a CMP, a whole-exome sequence, and a marrow extract. Good. We need to find out exactly what happened to her. [Birds chirping] What are we doing here? We are picking up stuff for a rainy day. Open the damn door. A.I. : Welcome back, Mr. Richter. "Open the damn door"? That's your password? Easy to remember. Okay, we got to grab night kits, H2O extractors, and solar bundles. You really think we need all this stuff? Tobias Shepherd is capable of just about anything. And I am prepared for... just about anything. He's not evil, JD. He's... he's just complicated. Complicated? That's the word you use to describe him? [Sighs] Complicated. Dr. Woods believes the hybrids have evolved... that they no longer pose an immediate threat. She's asked for a  détente . For us to sit down with her son... and find a way to coexist in peace. There will be no  détente . I'm not gonna be the man who presided over a mass extinction. We have the virus. We have the Humanichs. This ends now. What about Dr. Woods? Dr. Woods has chosen her side. She stands with the enemy. We'll treat her like the enemy. [Helicopter whirs in distance] How do you know we're not being tracked? The jeep is untrackable by satellite, thanks to a few contraptions my buddy Ray made for me. Okay, look, I know we're not on a major highway, but... have you noticed that for the past few miles we've seen nobody? No cars, no people... nothing. Yeah. I noticed. [Sighs] Where is everybody? With shocking news that affects the entire region. There is an at-large terrorist cell in our midst bearing biological weapons. This Red-Level emergency lockdown will remain in place for 72 hours. The alleged terrorists have been identified as former astronaut and GSC employee Dr. Molly Woods and disgraced Second Kuwait War veteran James Daniel Richter... So he destroyed our credibility... before we could destroy his. Your "complicated" friend... just made us the most wanted people in the world. Do you remember Paris? I remember climbing the Eiffel Tower and running down the Champs-Élysées. It was raining, but... There was a nice old lady. And she gave me her umbrella. It had a hole in it. Both : I was soaked. [Laughs] So you have all the same memories? Yeah, Lucas and Lucy, they share the same neural programming. They all do. Our memories were installed. We didn't have the luxury of learning by experience, like you. But I want to have memories with both of you, too. Okay. Well... let's make some right now. Just the three of us. Charlie, will you take a picture of us with my Pyxis Cube? Yeah. Lucas : What's that? It's a place where people keep their most important memories. Kind of like an old-school photo album, if you're into that sort of stuff. Ethan : Lucy, turn around, smile. Sorry. Let's do it. Everybody say "cheese and crackers." [Siren wailing in distance, alarm beeping] What's going on? What's going on is, we are in a security lockdown. What does that mean? It means we're not going anywhere for the moment. Shepherd betrayed us. He's looking for you. And us, too. We're gonna have to stay in hiding. We don't want to hide. We want to live and go about in the world freely. Well, I don't want to be the person to break the news to you, but you are a long way from that. We all are at this point. Okay, look, JD has supplies and food. He's ex-military, so he can help with defense. I can at least help you secure the perimeter. Mm-mm, no. We're not taking orders from one of them. I'm sorry, who the hell are you? This is Ares. JD. Molly. Hey, new guy, I laid my ass on the line for you people. "You people." Our mother trusts him. Your mother... doesn't know which side she's on. Okay, look, this isn't about sides. It's about survival. For all of us. We won't survive here. We should leave now. Scatter into the cities, propagate until the odds are in our favor, then let the humans decide... Decide what? If they want to live in our world... or die in theirs. I thought you wanted peace. It takes two sides for peace, doesn't it? Richter : All right, there is a five-county lockdown in place. Anybody who leaves here, they will be hunted down, captured and killed. And if we stay here, we're sitting ducks. Yeah. But they don't know where the ducks are sitting. Now, the GSC has a virus... that can kill all of us. Richter : The streets are empty right now. One person leaves this compound, just one... it's gonna lead the GSC right back to us. If we wait out the lockdown, it'll make it easier for us to disperse. It's only 72 hours. Now, we will stay here until then, help JD secure the grounds. If that's your decision, brother. Terra : Molly! Terra. You came back. Of course. Lucy : Hey. Oh. Hey there. Find out how long we'll be here? Um... I just got a special security clearance. We are going home tonight. That's good. Uh, Ethan asked if Lucas and I could spend the night with you guys. I told him it was up to you. No. Lucas isn't ready. We have to power him down here. Okay. Well, what about me? I think with Julie in Washington, he gets lonely. And you must, too. Me? No, I'm fine. But, uh... yeah, for Ethan? Sure. Why not? Charlie... I found your checklist for Humanichs. What's an expiration date? [Clears throat] You're not supposed to be snooping... I wasn't snooping. I was looking. John Woods made it very clear that he wanted Humanichs to have the human experience, so he built in a program for them to expire. You mean... die. I mean... humans die. It's just part of the deal. It sort of defines us. To make Humanichs more human, it just seemed logical to build in... a termination point. It's not logical to me. Humans have to die, we don't. If you want us to be more like you, then give us the same rights. Let us really live before we die. [Both sigh] Look, I'm so sorry you had to find out that way. I know it's a lot to absorb. You're responding like any human would. Because I'm more human than you think, Charlie. I wish you understood that. Believe it or not, Mei Fong's DNA has somehow... been converted to a triple helix. So you're saying, conclusively, that this woman is a hybrid? She will be. Soon. A casualty of microchimerism. We think there was a placental transfer of alien fetal cells during the pregnancy. Does this happen to every woman who survives a hybrid pregnancy? I don't know. Mei has a rare genetic marker called the "Kilimanjaro Allele". It might be why she's changing and others aren't. Run that marker through our employee database. Only one person with that same anomaly. Molly Woods. Can you stop the progression in this woman? Maybe, with a full plasma and marrow transplant, but... it could kill her. Do it. We need her consent. With all due respect, she has rights. Mei Fong is now an enemy of the state. Consent is not required. You have your orders. We thought Molly Woods was on the other side. It turns out she is the other side. Where are you going? To see Taylor. Don't you think it's about time I met him? When Taylor thinks it's necessary, he'll let me know. I figure we might want to get one or two of these things running. What? Why are you doing this? You know, when I was a kid, my dad and I, we used to take old cars and work on them... I'm... not talking about the engines. I'm an enemy of the state now, Molly. Not a lot of options. You could just dump all this stuff off and leave. I'm not a deserter. I'm not saying that you are. Molly. Heleos and some others have volunteered to keep watch. We're making up sleeping quarters. We weren't sure whether you wanted one bed or two. You know what? I, uh... I'm not gonna sleep tonight. I'm gonna keep watch with... Heleos. Yeah, Heleos and I are gonna keep watch. Come. Let's get you settled. So, Heleos, how old are you, one month or two? Excuse me? [Chuckles softly] Never mind. Gallows humor. Come on. Male A.I. : Who are you? Tobias Shepherd. Identification confirmed. What do you know? K-27416... W-45113... M-9808. Password confirmed. What do you have? Alexander the Great tetradrachma. Object confirmed. Hello, Taylor. Hello, General Shepherd. What can I do for you? I need analysis of every location that might serve as a compound for the hybrids. Certainly, General. When would you like these projections? Yesterday. That's impossible. Can I assume that's sarcasm? Yeah. You can. It is. Just get it done. [Crickets chirping] [Aural fractals sound] [Gunfire, men shouting] Man : JD! They found her innocent. Stop it! Right now! JD? You son of a bitch. No, no, no. JD, no! No, stop! He's running our perimeter lines. I thought we should get to know the man in charge of our survival. Yeah, is that how you treat your friends? He's your friend. A man unfaithful to his wife; left his daughter; and who had a hand in the deaths of hundreds of his own kind. And you... You ask us to trust that? Okay, you need to go. [Exhales] He's just trying to protect us. Yeah, I feel real safe. Heleos. 48 hours, and we were done here. Meaning? Meaning this was supposed to be a pit stop, not a parking lot. When we first got here, it was about you figuring out how to reverse what was happening to you. I don't hear you talking about that anymore. Because I don't even know if I can reverse it. You've stopped trying! These people, they aren't like us. All right? They are unknown. And what am I? Am I an unknown? You need to figure out which world you want to live in. You can't have both. Charlie : All right. What do you think? An oldie but a goodie? I'm sick of children's stories. I want something more grown-up, like Lucy would read. Oh, really? Like what? Uh, well... Julie's been reading "Huckleberry Finn." How about that? Really? Julie said she's reading that? It's supposed to be a classic. Very advanced thematically. I want that one. Okay. Got to cater to your audience. ♪ ♪ [Sighs quietly] John and Julie? Did you find it? Yeah. Yeah, I found it. I'm sorry about that. With Ares. JD has been... nothing but kind, helpful and generous. I know he's unhappy here. And you're wondering if you should be here... or with Ethan. You see? See, you are in my head. You know my thoughts and my feelings, and that's what I don't want. You can control what's happening to you, Molly. The headaches, the urges. You see that they've already started to recede. I don't know what I am. Yes, you do. And your best chance of survival is embracing that. Why are you still awake? Why aren't you powered down? I was bored. You get bored easily. Whose Pyxis Cube is that? It's Julie's. There's no photos of you on it. Only... John Woods. Was that her boyfriend? [Wry chuckle] Seems so, huh? But wasn't that Molly Woods' husband? [Laughs softly] You really don't learn by experience, do you? Are you making fun of me? Me? No. Sorry. I get surly when I drink. My heart gets pummeled. I'm sorry for your pain. Well, you know, that's the thing about humans. We all want what we can't have. Humanichs are like that, too. Yeah? What do you want that you can't have? Lucy... Sometimes you like to remind me that I'm just a machine. You're not just a machine; you know that. The more human experience you give me, the more human I become. I can be so much more if you let me. Wait, hold on. Wait. Wait, this is... this is illegal. It's like misuse of government property or something. Is that all I am? Property? No. Of course not. I want to feel what humans feel. Oh, my God, I could go to jail. Only if someone tells. Wai-Wai-Wait. No, no, wait. Wait. Come on, wait. [Charlie panting] Don't you like me, Charlie? That's not the point. This just can't happen for so many reasons... [Pants] I'm sorry. You need to go power down, and I... I need to go pour out the rest of this drink. [Exhales] We have task forces combing every hot spot Taylor gave us. Still no trace of where the hybrids are hiding out. We haven't lost yet. No? With schools, banks and business districts still shuttered, there is outrage over the disruption of everyday lives. With public pressure mounting to end this lockdown, there is still no word on the whereabouts of former astronaut Molly Woods and her accomplice, disgraced war veteran JD Richter. They're fighting this thing like a war. But it's not a war, it's a scourge. We're running out of time. We need to get personal. Meaning? Everyone has their Achilles' heel. What do they want? Even JD Richter. Newswoman : With this lockdown due to end in 24 hours, will the GSC dare to extend it and risk rioting in the streets? And in another twist, Kelsey Richter, daughter of suspected terrorist JD Richter and circuit court judge Dorothy Richter, was taken into custody today... What the hell? under the Loyalty Act. So the seven beautiful sisters were playing in the meadow, and then along came... a hunter... named Orion. And Orion wanted the sisters all to himself, so he chased them to the ends of the earth. But just when he thought he had them trapped, the most powerful god in the universe, Zeus... came along to rescue them. You came to rescue us from the hunters. Are you a god? No. None of us are gods. But you're still what Daddy says you are. And what is that? Our leader. We have to talk. How can they do that? That BS about aiding a terror cell. There's no depth Shepherd and his cronies won't sink to. He just wants to get your attention. He got it. What are you gonna do? I don't know, but I can't sit in Sherwood Forest hoping they live up to the ideals of the Constitution. I can't. I won't. I'm sorry. You're not going anywhere. Seriously, man, you gonna stop me? Ares. He knows our location. He could lead them straight to us. You don't know me very well. I know humans. And I'm not about to bet our futures on your professed loyalty. JD, don't! Ares, stop it! This is not a prison. He's free to go. Yeah, he's going. Hey! Get away from there! Get away! I thought by now you'd have some intel on where the hybrids might be hiding. Taalr : So did I, General. But to my surprise, initial sat-scans came up negative. So, what, we have nothing? Not yet. But I am currently exploring a new theory. I'm listening. In order to find life, perhaps we should be looking for the absence of it. Meaning? If the hybrids could emit an EMP powerful enough, they could create a thermal hole in my sat-scans. A blind spot. Precisely. Which would allow them to hide in plain sight. What am I looking at? Osgood Listening Station. Closed in 2025 due to defense budget cuts. This is an old satellite image of the area. This was shot this morning. Something is blocking my scans, something that wasn't there six months ago. Gated... tunnel systems, easily defendable... Well, this has to be it. What's your recommendation? Release the virus in conjunction with the deployment of the Humanichs army. And if we withheld release of the virus? In 6.5 months, the Homo sapiens genome will be diluted to the point that an extinction event is inevitable. [Alarm sounds] Charlie, what is that? You're being called up. Ethan : Lucy, are you leaving? Yes, I have to go now. This early? When will you be back? I'm not sure. I've, uh, been called into duty to fulfill my programming. Is Lucas going? Yes. Can't I come with you? Come with me? Ethan, do you think I want to go to war? I want to stay here and play video games and go outside, but that is not my function... is it, Charlie? So, no, Ethan, you can't come with me. You're not like us. You never will be. Hey. I'm sorry about last night. Don't worry. At least not today. We have reason to believe the target is located at the coordinates currently being uploaded to your nav system. Lucy, you will lead the recon op. Sir? At 0700... you and a subordinate will infiltrate the area. You will gather intel on the hybrids' position, numbers and defensive capabilities. Keep your distance. Do not engage the enemy. Understood? Yes, General. I'm sorry. I know this is hard for you. You're doing the right thing. Molly's made her choice. Now we've made ours. Toby. I've also made a choice. I've put in for a transfer. To D.C. I think it's best. For both of us. If that's what you want. It's not, but... If I stay here, I'm never gonna get what I want. ♪ ♪ Hey, will you do me a favor and hand me that screwdriver? So you're leaving. Yeah, soon as I get my truck running. I'm sorry to see you go. You might be the only one. I appreciate what you've done for us, JD. I know it hasn't been easy. You're a good man. I wouldn't go that far. Do me a favor, all right? Keep your eyes open. Stay alert. These guys aren't gonna stop looking for you until they find you. Understood. [Engine starts] [Engine revs, turns off] Molly, I, uh... I can't desert my daughter. You don't owe me an explanation. No, I... probably do. Just know that I hate deserting you. We're doing what we have to do. Maybe in another life... things could have been different. In that other life, you have two PhDs and a ticket to space. And I'm just a bum watching you in a ticker-tape parade. Thank you. For everything. In another life. In another life, Molly Woods. Yeah. [Engine starts] Our orders are "recon only." That's Molly Woods. We may never get a clean shot at her again. They must have a reason for their orders. The element of surprise will be lost. Heleos : Who are you? Hi. I'm Lucy. This is, uh, my friend Lucas. We're just out here deer hunting. We lost the buck we were chasing. You're not humans. What are you? Take him. General Shepherd, we found them. All of them.
