 ("Smoke Gets in Your Eyes" by Ray Conniff playing) 
  Ooh, ooh Ooh-ooh They ask me how I knew My true love was true Honey, what's a seven-letter word for "night demon"? 
  (chuckles) 
  It ends in "S". 
  DIANA: Bobbi's dead. 
  Remember? 
  And now you are, too. 
  When your heart's on fire You must realize Smoke gets in your eyes. 
  (caws) 
  BLACKWOOD: Morning. 
  Breakfast? 
  Bet you the farm I can get you comped. 
  Mm, I'm good. 
  Most important meal of the day. 
  Mm-hmm. 
  I'll leave you to your work. 
  (roulette ball clacking) 
  (footsteps echoing) 
  Hi. 
  Is this Dr. Mindy Levine? 
  Oh. 
  Give me her cell phone number. 
  She's there all day? 
  What are you doing here? 
  Need to talk to Billy. 
  All right. 
  Got it. 
  Thanks. 
  All right. 
  Uh, Billy's not here. 
  How are you with maps? 
  - What? 
  Huh? 
  - Maps? 
  How are you with maps?! 
  - Fine. 
  - Great. 
  Let's go. 
  Wait where are we going? 
  MINDY: The boundary line here is Roy Wheeler's orchards and property. 
  Blackwood orchards, property. 
  And all this is government property. 
  - So this is federal land? 
  - Yeah. 
  All right. 
  But what is this? 
  Don't know. 
  Might be a fault line or a utility line of some sort. 
  But I don't know if it's coming out of federal land. 
  Can you help us get here? 
  - Yeah. 
  - (sheep bleating) 
  There's no one out front. 
  Anton should be back soon. 
  What more can I do for you? 
  I'm looking for my dad. 
  Is he missing? 
  You tell me. 
  Last I knew, he was on his way to see you. 
  Well, we were supposed to meet, but he never showed. 
  Which, come to think of it, isn't very like him. 
  You know you owe me. 
  I have donated a lot of money to your tribe. 
  Look, I I can't this time. 
  You mean you won't? 
  Diana, I (scoffs) 
  You know what? 
  Okay, Joe, you're off the hook. 
  I'm I'm sorry. 
  No, Joe. 
  No. 
  I'm sorry. 
  (groaning) 
  - Anton? 
  - (grunting) 
  - (Diana yelling loudly) 
  - (grunts) 
  (Littlecrow gurgling) 
  (gasps) 
  (panting) 
  You break my heart. 
  Clean this up. 
  I need his thumb. 
  Anyway, if I hear anything, I'll let you know. 
  If I find out you're the reason he's gone missing Yeah? 
  Yeah. 
  Your mother's a horrible person. 
  She's complicated. 
  That's what she wants you to think. 
  I know you know something. 
  Just tell me. 
  (Anton groaning) 
  (groaning continues) 
  (panting) 
  (retches) 
  (sniffling) 
  (water dripping) 
  (gasping) 
  (grunting) 
  Oh! 
  (water rushing) 
  (quietly) 
  What did she do? 
  (beeps) 
  (beeps) 
  (water dripping) 
  (water sloshing) 
  - PATTY: Here? 
  - BRITTANY: Yes. 
  - PATTY: Here? 
  - BRITTANY: That's what it says. 
  Do you want your bag? 
  PATTY: I want I want both bags. 
  I want both bags. 
  Damn it. 
  All right. 
  (sighs) 
  All right. 
  All right, it's this way. 
  Are you sure? 
  It's the coordinates she gave us. 
  - All right. 
  - Uh-huh. 
  (cow lowing) 
  Are those f*cking cows? 
  Goddamn it. 
  (water sloshing) 
  Freaking me out that they're all so still. 
  It's like a painting. 
  - Oh, like that? 
  - It's here. 
  - Where? 
  - It's here! 
  What? 
  PATTY: sh1t. 
  BRITTANY: Okay, maybe maybe we go If we park around and then drive down. 
  - Oh, okay. 
  - I don't What? 
  BILLY: So I followed Diana Blackwood and her son over here to the start of the tunnel. 
  Somebody opened the tap. 
  Washes me all the way down here to Wheeler's place. 
  Okay, so if they keep digging right on Blackwood's property. 
  The tunnel starts on federal lands. 
  Yeah, exactly. 
  So, Blackwood's stealing water from federal lands? 
  Well, that's super illegal. 
  Yeah. 
  (explosion) 
  - Really? 
  - Come on. 
  Let's go. 
  You want to walk towards the explosion? 
  BILLY: Of course. 
  Come on. 
  (Patty muttering) 
  PATTY: I can't run! 
  I can't run. 
  MAN: All clear! 
  (crow cawing) 
  All right, next section. 
  Let's go! 
  Patty, I saw ponytail there before. 
  He was in the casino with Blackwood this morning. 
  - Really? 
  - Mm-hmm. 
  Hey, did Wade Blackwood ask you to blow that up? 
  - I don't speak English. 
  - Really? 
  Yeah. 
  I don't speak English. 
  You know, it's gonna be pretty hard to cover up. 
  You might want to get on the right side of this deal. 
  - I don't know what you're saying. 
  - Nah, I think you do. 
  Let's go. 
  (engine starts) 
  Patty. 
  All right, great. 
  Now what? 
  What, have you been playing in the dirt? 
  Yeah, something like that. 
  Well, you just can't seem to stay away from this place, can you? 
  The stakes keep changing. 
  - How's that? 
  - Tunneling on federal land's a federal crime, which means federal prison. 
  (horse neighs nearby) 
  - Is that true? 
  - Well, it must be. 
  That's why you're blowing it up, right? 
  (laughs) 
  I haven't the slightest idea what you're talking about. 
  You don't have a smoke, do you? 
  I don't smoke. 
  If I were you, I'd think really long and hard about cutting my clients a big old fat-ass check. 
  Well, if you've got proof of a, uh, federal crime I'd go to a federal judge instead of coming over here - to see me. 
  - These people have suffered long enough, okay? 
  And a criminal case takes precedent over a class action and that sh1t can drag on for f*cking ever. 
  Sounds to me like you're asking me for a favor. 
  Is that what you're doing, Counselor? 
  Come on. 
  Off the record. 
  Hmm? 
  Well, pick your poison. 
  Think about how you want this to play out, 'cause otherwise I'm gonna take this to the judge in the morning. 
  What'd you say? 
  I didn't quite catch that. 
  I said I'm gonna take it to the judge in the morning. 
  - Yeah, that's what I thought you said. 
  - Yeah. 
  (car door opens, closes) 
  (engine starts) 
  (sighs) 
  Hey, Diana. 
  Can you come home? 
  (pours drink) 
  (water running) 
  (exhales) 
  Where have you been? 
  - Make me some toast. 
  - I need to talk to you. 
  After. 
  - Now. 
  - (faucet squeaks off) 
  (sighs) 
  (sighs) 
  Billy McBride knows about the tunnel. 
  I took care of it. 
  You blew up my tunnel? 
  I need you to tell me if there are any loose ends that would tie us to that f*cking tunnel. 
  Hmm? 
  Diana? 
  Turn the water back on. 
  Not until you answer me. 
  You've lost your edge. 
  You're going to federal prison, and you're not going to drag me down there with you. 
  You are weak. 
  (whispers) 
  And that's boring. 
  (sighs) 
  (chuckling) 
  (Diana chuckles) 
  (chuckles) 
  (chuckling) 
  Nothing will stop you. 
  Nothing's gonna stop me. 
  (kisses) 
  (screaming) 
  Huh? 
  I did stop you! 
  (gasps, exhales shakily) 
  (indistinct chatter nearby) 
  What time is it now? 
  - Huh? 
  - What time is it now? 
  It's 9:19. 
  All right, so he's 20 minutes late. 
  Yeah. 
  Right. 
  Do you think he's gonna show? 
  Hell, I don't know. 
  I mean, I hope so. 
  Maybe he's gonna f*ck us all. 
  I don't know. 
  All right, let's go. 
  (Blackwood laughing) 
  PAXTON: I know another one just like that. 
  You-you ever hear the one about the guy (door closes) 
  BILLY: Oh. 
  Well, what the hell's going on in here? 
  BLACKWOOD: Boyd has just been appointed to Second District Court of Appeals. 
  BILLY: Congratulations. 
  - Mm-hmm. 
  - You must have earned it. 
  - Could I pour you one? 
  - No, I'm good. 
  - No? 
  - No. 
  I also, I don't want one. 
  You weren't offering. 
  - Yeah. 
  - Never mind. 
  Mr. McBride, Ms. Papagian, let's make this quick. 
  What do you have for me? 
  Well, Your Honor, during the course of our discovery, we ran across some evidence that Mr. 
  Blackwood has been drilling an illegal tunnel through federal land, and stealing water from a protected federal reservoir. 
  And this evidence goes straight to the heart of our case, details a ongoing criminal conspiracy to steal water, first from the state and when that wasn't enough, from federal land, too. 
  Ms. Sen, what do you know about this? 
  Your Honor, during the course of this litigation, my client became aware of a shell company owned by his sister, Diana Blackwood, Fer-de-lance. 
  Upon further investigation, he discovered that Fer-de-lance is solely responsible for this tunneling project. 
  My client, nor any of his companies, have had any involvement or prior knowledge of said - tunneling project. 
  - So she was doing this - without your knowledge. 
  - BLACKWOOD: She's a grown-up. 
  I'm not responsible for her actions. 
  Which brings us to the bigger point. 
  Fer-de-lance is not a defendant in this class action lawsuit. 
  It has nothing to do with your case. 
  Okay, so you're hiding behind your sister, and then you're gonna throw her in front of the bus. 
  PAXTON: Mr. 
  McBride, what would you - like me to do with this? 
  - I would have you look beyond your promotion and see what the hell's going on here. 
  Well, you're in the wrong place for that. 
  This is not a U. S. District Court. 
  I am not a federal judge. 
  And this has nothing to do with your case against Mr. Blackwood. 
  Bring me something I can actually use by Monday, or I will have no choice but to put your case to a swift and merciful end. 
  We're done here. 
  (elevator bell dings) 
  WOMAN (over P. A. ): Dr. Michelle to labor delivery. 
  Dr. Michelle to labor delivery. 
  BRITTANY: I got a response - from the bar association. 
  - Yeah? 
  It was a no. 
  (TV turns off) 
  No, Brittany, you're not gonna be a lawyer. 
  (Brittany sniffs) 
  It's kind of what I expected, but now it's official. 
  That committee doesn't know sh1t. 
  You deserve a fresh start, honey. 
  Well, I'm moving to Chicago. 
  My brother, he's got a place there. 
  He's got an extra room, so he's gonna let me stay with him and you know, till I figure it out. 
  It's a fresh start. 
  (chuckles softly) 
  L. A. has been Well, I wouldn't say it's been good to me, but at least I met you. 
  - And Denise. 
  - (whispers) 
  Yeah. 
  - She's a good kid. 
  - Yeah. 
  But she needs her dad. 
  - Yeah. 
  - Seriously, Billy, get the f*ck back to L. A. 
  - and be there for her, okay? 
  - Yeah. 
  Yeah. 
  Yeah, I'm going to pretty soon, okay? 
  Can you do me a favor and, uh give that to Denise, will you? 
  Yeah. 
  Tell her to call me or text me and just let me know she's seen it, okay? 
  - Sure. 
  - All right. 
  Stardust and to whisper I'm gonna miss you. 
  Go to sleep Save it for later. 
  - I'm not gone yet. 
  - Yeah. 
  Is all right I close my eyes Then I drift away Into the magic night I softly say A silent prayer Like dreamers do Then I fall asleep To dream My dreams Well, kid, we made it through another night. 
  Yeah, barely. 
  Let me tell you something. 
  I was like Stanley looking for Livingstone. 
  I'm starting to get separation anxiety when I don't see you. 
  (chuckles) 
  You know something, Rita, they only made one of you, honey. 
  Aw. 
  Thanks. 
  Hey, by the way, have you seen Littlecrow around? 
  What do you mean? 
  What do you mean? 
  Somebody told me that they saw him at the buffet and he looked like death warmed over. 
  Who told you that? 
  I can't reveal my sources. 
  Oh, come on, Rita. 
  Are you serious? 
  Yeah. 
  Don't get sore. 
  All right, somebody else told me he finally kicked the bucket and turned into a f*cking crow. 
  I can't help it So you can believe what you want. 
  - (phone vibrating) 
  - I remember Yeah. 
  I'm not sure what to believe anymore, to tell you the truth. 
  Yeah. 
  Mm. 
  Oh, I got to take this, honey. 
  W-Wait, are-are we gonna have breakfast? 
  Hang on, honey. 
  You never know. 
  We just might. 
  Well, McBride, good to see you. 
  And here's mud in your eye. 
  Yeah, you, too. 
  (chuckles) 
  Hey, hon. 
  What's up? 
  What am I supposed to do with this? 
  Did you read it? 
  I skimmed it. 
  Well, I want you to read every word of it, okay? 
  'Cause I know this Marisol thing really got to you. 
  What did Brittany tell you? 
  She didn't give any details. 
  I know it got under your skin. 
  It got under my skin, too. 
  But I know how to deal with it. 
  By drinking and running away? 
  We're talking about you here, okay? 
  I just don't understand why she gets away with it. 
  Well, maybe she doesn't. 
  This NDA ties her to a bunch of horrible political sh1t. 
  So, maybe we got something here. 
  Okay. 
  So You're a smart girl. 
  Run with it. 
  I'm not supposed to have this, am I? 
  I don't know what you're talking about. 
  We never had this conversation. 
  (phone vibrates) 
  Oh, hang on a second. 
  Hang on. 
  Hey, I got to go, all right? 
  I-I'll be home soon. 
  All right. 
  All right, I love you. 
  Talk to you soon. 
  I love you, too. 
  Dreams. 
  (indistinct chatter) 
  What are you listening to? 
  Oh, a podcast. 
  Slow Burn. 
  The new episode? 
  BILLY: So, we understand that you have a grievance against Diana Blackwood. 
  Oh. 
  Really? 
  What makes you think that? 
  (sighs) 
  Look, any-anything you can-can give us, it would really help us keep them from hurting other people. 
  Oh. 
  Oh, sure. 
  I can help you. 
  Uh, you know, I kept a paper trail with a memo line reading, "For super secret illegal tunnel. 
  Shh. 
  Don't tell". 
  You guys, I'm not an idiot. 
  Okay? 
  There's no paper trail. 
  - You could testify. 
  - (scoffs) 
  No, that's not happening. 
  Diana Blackwood is f*cking crazy. 
  Why do you think I pay a big man to sit outside my door? 
  How 'bout we record your testimony? 
  No, they think I'm dead. 
  And that's the way I'd like to keep it. 
  PATTY: But you're not. 
  We can subpoena you. 
  (sighs) 
  Okay, look, there is something I kept just in case I found myself in the middle of a Blackwood shitstorm. 
  What do you want? 
  Can you move me to a safe place? 
  Yeah, we can do that. 
  Okay. 
  Make it out of the country, and we'll talk. 
  (sighs) 
  (slot machines chiming) 
  BLACKWOOD: Oh. 
  Morning. 
  Good morning, Wade. 
  I got a question for you. 
  You know a Rochelle Purple? 
  Hmm. 
  Doesn't ring a bell. 
  Well, actually, it was a trick question,  
  - 'cause I know you do. 
  - (snorts) 
  (chuckles) 
  - Yeah. 
  - Hmm. 
  BLACKWOOD: Did you hear what I said? 
  ROCHELLE: I think you dropped out. 
  Wait, can you just say that again? 
  BLACKWOOD: I said every dime spent on this tunnel project is going to come out of Fer-de-lance. 
  ROCHELLE: I don't know what that is. 
  (Blackwood groans) 
 
 
 
  BLACKWOOD: I know that you and Diana set up a shell corporation to rob me blind. 
  ROCHELLE: Wade, I can explain BLACKWOOD: You are going to make it up to me. 
  And you're going to protect my ass in the process. 
  ROCHELLE: But that would put Diana at risk. 
  She will not do well in a women's prison. 
  - BLACKWOOD: So be it. 
  - Shut it off. 
  - ROCHELLE: She's your family. 
  - Shut it off. 
  So does that jog your memory? 
  I want every f*cking copy. 
  Okay. 
  Well, you're gonna have to add a few zeros to that offer of yours. 
  And then there's Gene Bennett. 
  So (grunts) 
  (clicks tongue) 
  Whatever it takes. 
  And then you can go f*ck yourself. 
  You'll get your copies when you wire the money. 
  How's that? 
  Just so you know, you're not welcome around here anymore. 
  (chuckles) 
  No sh1t? 
  Actually, I think I've had my fill of the Central Valley. 
  (Blackwood grunts) 
  It's a very large settlement, Mr. McBride. 
  That's what he offered us. 
  I'm just surprised. 
  Mr. 
  Blackwood must feel very, very bad  
  - about something. 
  - He does, Your Honor. 
  Given the circumstances, we believe it's a fair, reasonable, and adequate amount. 
  I'm sure you do. 
  Ms. Sen? 
  SUMI: Yes, Your Honor. 
  Mr. Blackwood is willing to pay the premium, because he's asking that the class and its counsel be bound by an NDA. 
  From here on out, they cannot mention anything that they've learned during the course of this case to anyone. 
  Mr. McBride, you're prepared to enter into a secret settlement? 
  Yes, Your Honor. 
  It's the best possible result for our clients. 
  You'd think so. 
  They're all now millionaires. 
  Ms. "Pa-pa-gian"? 
  Pagian. 
  It's Well, it's Solis-Papagian. 
  I've been married twice. 
  It doesn't You don't care. 
  Um, yes, we agree to the terms. 
  We're agreeing to that. 
  With the money wired to an escrow account  
  - by the end of the day. 
  - Obvious. 
  Yeah. 
  PAXTON: The parties' joint motion is hereby granted. 
  Pending notice to the class and final approval, you and your clients are, from this moment forward, bound by the terms of the NDA. 
  (indistinct chatter) 
  All right. 
  That's done. 
  Yeah, it is. 
  Want to go have a drink, celebrate? 
  Oh, no, I can't do that. 
  I'm pregnant. 
  Hang on a second. 
  Did you say you're pregnant? 
  - Yeah. 
  - Are you serious? 
  Yeah. 
  You tell me that like you just bought a bag  
  - of f*cking Doritos? 
  - Mm The f*ck's How did that happen? 
  I had sexual intercourse with a man. 
  And when were you gonna tell me? 
  When could I have told you? 
  Any f*cking time. 
  You've been stowed away in some casino, Howard Hughes-ing it with your pee jars and your black soap and God knows what. 
  Not really the environment to share news. 
  Not to mention, didn't think you were interested in lady bit news, so Well, I was under the impression that we're friends, you know? 
  And that's kind of big news. 
  I will name it after you. 
  - You're damn right you will. 
  - All right? 
  Billy or Billina. 
  Maybe. 
  All right? 
  I'm sorry, h-how much is the settlement? 
  It's $500 million. 
  Right. 
  Each member of the class will get a little over a million. 
  But you're lead plaintiff, so you'll get about two. 
  And the Blackwoods are gonna sign over ownership of Gloria's restaurant as part of the deal. 
  You just need to take this information to the others. 
  And we highly recommend you take it, 'cause it doesn't get much better than this. 
  It doesn't. 
  So I'm gonna have money. 
  Yeah. 
  I've never had money before. 
  (chuckling, crying) 
  Hi. 
  Yes, I'm in possession of an interesting nondisclosure agreement that Marisol Silva signed when she was on the city council. 
  Can I talk to a reporter who'd want to look into that? 
  Awesome. 
  Thanks. 
  (elevator bell chimes) 
  (loud clicking) 
  Oh. 
  Um You scared me. 
  I just was New science suggests that the bond between a mother and her child directly relates to enhancing the child's IQ. 
  Based on your performance on this case why don't we make your maternity leave permanent. 
  Give that child of yours at least a fighting chance to graduate from junior high school. 
  (exhales) 
  (crickets chirping) 
  Hi. 
  Is Christina Lukin home? 
  Mom! 
  Oh, I forgot. 
  She went out. 
  Yeah. 
  Okay. 
  Do you know when she'll be back home? 
  I don't know. 
  Sorry. 
  Could I just if I could Do me a favor. 
  Grab the box out of the back for Mom. 
  Evan. 
  Hi. 
  Can I help you? 
  Christina Lukin? 
  Yeah. 
  You're young. 
  Sorry? 
  Nothing. 
  Um Uh, I'm a Realtor, and I've been talking to some of the homeowners in your neighborhood to see if they were interested in, um in selling their homes in the near future. 
  Oh. 
  Um Yeah, I'm not really, um, thinking about - selling my home right now. 
  - No, no, yeah. 
  Just so you know, it is a seller's market. 
  Here, especially, with the You guys have a great school district. 
  - Mm-hmm. 
  - Um And then a lot of the homes are gonna go above asking. 
  - Sure. 
  - Yeah. 
  - Hey. 
  - Hi. 
  Uh, Mom, this is Casey's stuff. 
  - Why am I bringing it in? 
  - Get the box. 
  Um Do you have, um - like, a business card? 
  - Business card. 
  Yeah. 
  - Thank you. 
  - Mm-hmm. 
  Um So Thank you, bud. 
  - There you go. 
  - Perfect. 
  Thanks. 
  Patty. 
  So, you're a Realtor and a lawyer? 
  That is how it worked out, yeah. 
  That's amazing. 
  - That's really cool. 
  - Thanks. 
  (chuckles) 
  - Good for you. 
  Yeah. 
  - Thanks. 
  Yeah. 
  (chuckles) 
  You're welcome. 
  So It was really nice meeting you. 
  It was really nice to-to meet you, too. 
  - Bye. 
  Mm-hmm. 
  - Thanks. 
  (engine turns off) 
  I don't know How much longer Hey, Gene. 
  Hey, could I get one of those? 
  And, uh, he can have another one, too. 
  Thank you. 
  I don't know How much longer I stopped over at your place and, you know, saw your truck out here, so Well, it's too quiet there. 
  Just got tired of talking to myself. 
  Yeah, I understand. 
  (Billy exhales) 
  Thinking about selling the place? 
  Yeah, well it was always Bobbi's place. 
  Well, Blackwood will buy it for $10 million, so What? 
  (scoffs) 
  Why? 
  I mean, it's-it's worth a hell of a lot less than that. 
  Well, he's gonna do right by you and Bobbi. 
  You don't have to sell it, but if you decide to, just wanted you to know the offer stands. 
  (sighs) 
  How much longer So, that's it. 
  - Yeah. 
  - (inhales sharply) 
  That's about it. 
  Not with a bang but a whimper. 
  You take care of yourself, Gene. 
  Yeah, you, too. 
  All right. 
  (door opens, closes) 
  BLACKWOOD: You are going to make it up to me. 
  And you're going to protect my ass in the process. 
  ROCHELLE: That would put Diana at risk. 
  She will not do well in a women's prison. 
  BLACKWOOD: So be it. 
  ROCHELLE: She's your family. 
  BLACKWOOD: She doesn't give a sh1t about family. 
  And she is never going to get a piece of this land. 
  Due to a family emergency, I must regretfully resign as mayor. 
  This will allow me the time and attention to deal with this matter. 
  Many are speculating Marisol Silva's resignation is a preemptive move to avoid the fallout from a story the L. A. 
  Times just published, linking her to a secret state water deal that's only beginning to be uncovered. 
  - Mayor, when can we expect you back? 
  - No comment. 
  (reporters clamoring) 
  Ms. Silva? 
  The state attorney general would like to ask you some questions. 
  I'd like to speak to my lawyer. 
  Good idea. 
  Follow us. 
  (laughs) 
  (phone vibrating) 
  - Hello? 
  - CHRISTINA: Patty. 
  Um, hi. 
  This is Christina Lukin. 
  You there? 
  Uh, yeah. 
  Sorry, go ahead. 
  Listen, I-I don't think I'm quite ready to sell my house, but I had this (sighs) 
  This is going to sound so strange, but when I was talking to you, I had a feeling that we've met before. 
  I know who you are. 
  Can you, um, can you please come back? 
  Yeah. 
  (groans) 
  (thunder rumbling) 
  (thunder crashes) 
  Hey, Billy. 
  (echoing) 
  What are you doing, Diana? 
  Diana, wait. 
  (engine revving) 
  (tires squeal) 
  (tires squealing) 
  (sustained honking)
