 [beep, music stops] 
 Time to go, Donald. 
 You know how I feel about travel. 
 I hope you find the trip worth it. 
 Well, if I'm going to be handling the case, I think I'm entitled to a few answers. 
 I'm sure you do feel entitled. 
 Everyone else seems to nowadays. 
 [beep] 
 All right. 
 I can't promise you anything. 
 But it'll help, right? 
 Maybe, but I don't want you suing me if it doesn't work. 
 All right, just give me the f*cking waiver. 
 Here we go. 
 So we're clear, my recommendation is *** 
 But it's not a cure. 
 You'll still have the apnea, ablation. 
 It'll just open you up a little bit. 
 Okay, just so you know, you're not putting me under. 
 Just do whatever a dentist does. 
 I want to be awake for this sh1t, you know? 
 Let me ask you something. 
 If a guy was talking to you about suicide when you were working on him or whatever, would you put that in your file? 
 Are you thinking of suicide? 
 Why would I think of suicide? 
 Have you taken a look at yourself? 
 No. I'm not committing suicide. 
 It's for a case that I'm working on. 
 Okay. Yeah. I'd put it in my file along with a note saying you should go see a shrink and get on Zoloft. 
 Come on. While we're young. 
 Don't give me that look, Leonard. 
 This is your big chance. 
 Go in there and show everybody what you're capable of. 
 You're not staying? 
 Not my department, son. 
 Now, lying to other lawyers? 
 That's your job. 
 You should have told me what was going on, Wendell... 
 Why we couldn't settle. 
 Hey, I shouldn't have had to tell you. 
 Cooperman told you. 
 Just answer all of her questions. 
 [engine starts] 
 Leonard : Collateral damage. 
 Dead civilians. 
 I saw it myself when I served over there. 
 Every time we killed a kid, we turned a hundred of them against us. 
 Ryan Larson was working to stop this sort of thing from happening. 
 Turn it off, please. 
 Why are you showing me this? 
 Why do you even have this? 
 Do you know how bad this would look to a jury? 
 That you collect this battlefield p0rn? 
 It's R&D. 
 It is standard industry practice to maintain a library of all products in use and negligent not to. 
 Ryan studied these to help figure out how to save innocent lives. 
 Really? With a new weapons system? 
 The weapons are fine. 
 The problem is getting them on site. 
 By the time we know where the bad guys are and get all the necessary approvals to fire the missiles, the bad guys have left the building. 
 Justice delayed. 
 Exactly. And Ryan was developing a new fuel system to cut down delay, get the bombs there faster. 
 So he was testing military grade fuel on the boat. 
 That's what you're telling me? 
 Because if that's true, you're f*cked. 
 Open sea testing is illegal. 
 He was not doing tests. 
 The only reason he was out there was suicide. 
 Work stress, marriage issues. 
 The man was unstable, and he used the fuel he was testing to kill himself. 
 Then why not tell McBride and the widow all this? 
 We never got federal approval to test the fuel. 
 [sigh] 
 The Pentagon has been hammering us to fix the delay issue, but if we followed their rules, it would take us ten years before we got to market. 
 And by then we might have lost the contract. 
 Better to beg for forgiveness than ask for commission. 
 We're DOD contractors. 
 By law we're required to report all legal settlements to the Pentagon, which means admitting we broke the law. 
 They would shut down our fuel research, or the Department of Energy would. 
 So why the f*ck were you trying to settle in chambers? 
 As all this happened before I started here, I didn't know anything about what Ryan was working on until today. 
 [scoff] You're general counsel. 
 Leonard didn't need to know because I knew. 
 Maybe next time, you'll heed my advice. 
 Talk about sandbagged. 
 I almost felt sorry for him. 
 Don't. 
 Corporations keep general counsels in order to have someone to blame if things go badly. 
 Leonard is a highly paid scapegoat. 
 Are you satisfied? 
 Have all your questions been answered, all your doubts assuaged? 
 Don't get mad at me for wanting to know the facts of my own case. 
 That's my job. It's why you pay me. 
 Doesn't answer my question. 
 I'm not sure. 
 As you said, it's not unusual for big corporations to keep things from their lawyers. 
 Obviously, Leonard was upset... humiliated. 
 So I guess I'm partially satisfied. 
 [scoff] Partially. 
 Come home with me. 
 I want to f*ck you. 
 I think I'm entitled. 
 You're not entitled to sh1t. 
 You never were. 
 Oh, good. 
 Good. Smoking after surgery. That's smart. 
 I didn't have the surgery. 
 He cranked up that f*cking machine and scared the sh1t out of me, and I chickened out. 
 Whatever. 
 I got the... I got the prosecutor to knock down your DUI to a misdemeanor and impaired driving. 
 And, uh, and they're going to drop the resisting arrest, too, so... 
 I'm not going to plead guilty. 
 Yes, you are, man. 
 I'm done. 
 You want to risk going to jail to prove something that you can't ever prove. 
 And then what? 
 What, you're going to leave me holding a big bag of sh1t from the Larson case? 
 I said I'm not f*cking pleading guilty. 
 I already told you that before, okay? 
 Okay. 
 God damn it. 
 What the f*ck? 
 [honk] 
 You do one good thing. 
 You get us past summary judgment, and you convince the judge that we have a case. 
 And that's great. 
 But then you turn around, and you immediately f*ck it up. 
 I mean, what is that? Why? Why do you do that? 
 Could we please f*cking go? 
 Could you start the f*cking car? 
 $500,000! 
 Do you know how much money that is? 
 Do you understand that? 
 And you turn it down without even asking the client, without even asking me. 
 It's my case. 
 I brought you on to settle this, not to drag it out for some personal agenda. 
 And for what? 
 You want to what, prove something to Cooperman? 
 You want to prove something to yourself. 
 It doesn't matter! 
 Nobody cares! 
 And it doesn't f*cking matter because, at the end of the day, they're big and we're little. 
 And they're going to kill us, and I am terrified. 
 I am terrified, do you understand that? 
 [honk] 
 How did you know I needed you tonight? 
 Are you a f*cking psychic? 
 [whimpering] 
 A little cold out tonight, baby? 
 All right. Come on. 
 Just don't make a habit out of it, though. 
 She was due in court at that time... 
 Ahem. 
 Let me check. 
 She does have an opening in... 
 What the f*ck? 
 Callie. 
 Sorry. Donald asked us to make sure that the discovery... 
 Donald? 
 You're on a first name basis with Mr. Cooperman now? 
 No. 
 f*ck off. 
 Sorry. 
 I don't know who you think you are, but you don't come in my office without my permission. 
 But there's a discovery hearing later this afternoon, and... 
 Get out. 
 A lot of... I'm sorry. 
 I didn't mean to overstep my bounds. I just... 
 Get out! 
 Sorry. 
 [line ringing] 
 Donald Cooperman's office. 
 Let me speak to Donald. 
 He's not in. 
 f*ck you. He's always in. 
 Put him on, Nicole. 
 He's not in. 
 [click] 
 Therefore, I must by law allow this lawsuit to proceed. 
 Mr. McBride has filed for a number of discovery requests and moved for an expedited discovery schedule. 
 Well, obviously, we'll need a few months to comply with those requests. 
 No, you don't. 
 A client like Borns Tech has most files online already. 
 We don't, actually. 
 And the ones that aren't are in a warehouse. 
 But that's okay. They got a system. 
 I know. I designed it. 
 They put the files on a plane to India, where they got a bunch of guys... 
 Or kids, for all I know... 
 Scanning each piece of paper through hundreds of machines 24 hours a day seven days a week. 
 What used to take about two years for discovery takes them about a week now. 
 They can scan millions of documents in a few seconds. 
 We can't do that. 
 We don't have the people or the computers or their algorithms. 
 We got sweat labor. 
 Fine. We'll agree to the expedited discovery process. 
 We don't want this case delayed. 
 We'll deliver the discovery to them next week. 
 In return, I ask that Mr. McBride names his anonymous whistle blower so that we can investigate who it is and schedule his deposition. 
 No. 
 Excuse me? 
 Well, since our initial client Rachel Kennedy was killed, we're afraid that our witnesses may be in danger. 
 Objection. It is slander to suggest that a corporation such as Borns Technology could have been involved in Rachel Kennedy's death, and I ask that Mr. McBride be sanctioned. 
 By the way, allegations in court are not slander. 
 Say them outside the courtroom, and they will be. 
 And we will not hesitate to sue. 
 [chuckling] Ohh. 
 Judge : Okay. 
 Mr. McBride, you got a choice: to name all your eyewitnesses or back up your allegations of danger. 
 Fine, as long as the court's on notice and they're on notice not to do anything to our people. 
 Notice of what? 
 What... What exactly is he implying? 
 Or doesn't he have the balls to say it? 
 Hoo hoo hoo! 
 Judge : Hey. Hey, you. 
 Sit down. 
 Now. 
 You want to explain that? 
 I just thought that Mr. McBride was out of... 
 Was out of line and that I should call him on it. 
 You back-doored me to Cooperman. 
 N-No. 
 Not... It's... 
 Spit it out. 
 Fine. He emailed me last night, and he told me... 
 That if Mr. McBride brought up Rachel Kennedy, I should hit back with... 
 He told you to speak? 
 Really? 
 Yeah. 
 He did. 
 I'm sorry. Didn't you get the email, too? 
 Huh. 
 That's odd, isn't it? 
 So other than the Charger tickets, did you guys have anything else planned to do? 
 Everything. 
 ComicCon, fishing, he was teaching me to play golf. 
 He ever seem depressed to you? 
 No. 
 Honey... 
 No. I'm sorry, Mrs. Larson. 
 You can be here, but you can't really talk. 
 I'm sorry. That's... 
 Dad wasn't depressed with me, Mom. 
 You guys fought, but Dad and I were fine. 
 In fact, most of the time, he was really happy. 
 Did he ever talk about his work with you? 
 Not much. Just that... he didn't like the project he was on. 
 Did he say why? 
 Just that, whatever it was, it was taking too long. 
 That's enough for today. 
 Come on. Come in. 
 Come inside. 
 I'm sure Rachel never mentioned it, but I found this in Ryan's desk after he died. 
 Go ahead. You can... 
 You can read it. 
 That's my husband's suicide note. 
 f*ck me. 
 This is going to bury us. 
 Not necessarily. 
 Look, she found the letter after he died. 
 If she'd found it before he died, then he could have just come across as a guy who's pissed off about work and he's blowing off steam, not like some guy who's going to blow himself up. 
 Sometimes people want to cover their ass. 
 They want to get something in the file that says that they're against whatever bad sh1t the company's up to. 
 Well, in any case, we're going to have to prove that this isn't a suicide letter. 
 Oh, I got some leads on that. 
 You did well at the hearing. 
 I'm glad to hear you say that. 
 I was starting to think you'd lost faith in me for some reason. 
 Why would you think that? 
 I don't know. 
 Free-floating anxiety. 
 It wasn't because I reached out to Lucy Kittridge, was it? 
 Why did you? 
 She's aggressive, hungry, young. 
 All things you... used to be. 
 There's no need to test me, Donald. 
 You're right. 
 You're still hungry and aggressive. 
 Experience has made you wise. 
 And curious. 
 I hope that it has. 
 You're so curious about Ryan Larson that you made me watch Leonard Letts' dog and pony show. 
 The young are not wise enough to be curious, ask questions. 
 Mm. 
 Is that the reason for Lucy? 
 You want someone you can keep in the dark? 
 I do like the dark. 
 Billy will turn this into David and Goliath. 
 Solo practitioner fighting for justice against the big giant law firm and a weapons manufacturer. 
 Lucy is an innocent little girl. 
 A small, delicate little flower. 
 Lucy Kittridge is now first chair on the Borns Tech case. 
 You cannot be serious. 
 She's a kid. 
 f*ck. 
 How long is this going to take? 
 Go ahead. Go ahead. Ask me another question. 
 Patty : All right, Ned. Tell me again what exactly did Ryan Larson do? 
 I already told you I didn't know him very well, although I did know that Ryan's team worked in an entirely different department and that they were... smart but not super-smart. 
 They all wanted to be rocket men like me, but they didn't have it. 
 Hmm. It? 
 I'm not sure that you'd understand. 
 An engineering pedigree. 
 Mm. 
 Strong math background, creator gene, and something that's... ineffable... 
 You know, bigness, courage, and clarity. 
 Genius. 
 And you had it? 
 I was the smartest engineer in that entire place. 
 That's why I worked the ballistic missile team. 
 And Ryan worked on bombs? 
 Munitions. 
 I don't know how many times I have to tell you we don't call them bombs. 
 m*therf*cker, you called them bombs the first time that we met you. 
 What did he say? 
 What did you say? Rocket ass-bombs? 
 I don't... 
 I never said that. 
 Okay, Ned, you cannot lie. 
 I don't lie. I never lie. 
 And you can't snap at people during the deposition. 
 If I'm annoyed, I'm going to let them know. 
 No, you're not. You're going to answer politely and calmly. 
 This... This... Right here, this... 
 This is highly unethical. 
 What is? 
 You telling me what to think, making me say things. 
 Nobody is making you say or do anything. 
 This... This is boring. 
 This is boring. I am bored. 
 Ned... 
 I am bored. 
 Please. 
 This is boring. 
 This is boring. 
 Please, we're just trying to prepare you for a deposition. Okay? 
 I want a third of whatever you're getting. 
 What? 
 This is turning out to be a lot more work and... and inconvenience than I had originally expected, so I want to be compensated financially. 
 Okay, we can't do that because if we did that, you'd have no credibility with the jury. 
 Fine. 
 Also, it is illegal. 
 [scoff] 
 So... 
 You're a f*cking bitch. 
 Okay, I mean, I can't... 
 All right, Ned, listen. 
 Listen. 
 Let me explain something to you, buddy. 
 If you talk to her that way again, I'll beat your f*cking ass right here in your own house. 
 She was... 
 I don't care what she said. 
 I have... 
 Listen to me. 
 Ned. Don't make me beat your ass. 
 All right now. 
 This plastic sh1t here. 
 Now, Marquez' boys say it rained down on their boat right after the explosion. 
 I want you to tell me exactly what this stuff is and exactly what its use is. 
 It's ignition casing for a highly classified experimental fuel system for drones to deliver massive munitions. 
 Ah, but you said that Ryan Larson didn't have what it takes to work on missiles. 
 Drones are not missiles, you stupid f*cking bitch. 
 I'm done. 
 They're toys. 
 Anything that she can buy at Wal-mart doesn't count as a missile. 
 Ned, what did I just get through saying to you? 
 I'm sorry, but she asks stupid questions, and... 
 Ned, she's asking you the same stupid questions that they're going to ask you. 
 Don't you get the point here? 
 She's just doing her job, that's all. 
 Yeah. 
 Now... tell me about it. 
 Ryan's team worked on a fuel system for Borns Tech. 
 It's a very unstable, very dangerous fuel, the use of which... The testing of which is banned by U.S. and international law. 
 Can you test it on the ocean? 
 Legally? 
 You can't test it at all. 
 She's 26 years old. 
 First chair. He's got to be f*cking kidding me. 
 It's ridiculous. 
 Cooperman has lost it. 
 I mean, he was never right to begin with, but now he's insane. 
 Okay. 
 Please explain to me what happened on the boat. 
 Uh, you don't want to know. 
 No, actually, I do want to know. 
 If Donald's being this crazy, I want to know why. I'm a partner. 
 We all have financial stakes in this, so... 
 Ah. 
 You're afraid I'm going to tell Billy. 
 That's incredibly insulting. 
 Well, you still love him, even though he's always been a sh1t to you. 
 Oh ho ho ho. 
 I'm civil to him for the sake of our daughter. 
 Really? How's that going? 
 Because last I heard, she couldn't stand to be in the same room as you. 
 Why would you say something like that? 
 Sorry. 
 We should have left here years ago and started our firm. 
 We still could. 
 Stop it. You know what? 
 You always bring this up whenever you're being a sh1t to me. 
 We're never starting our own firm. 
 Well, if you do still care about him, you should tell him to drop the case. 
 
 
 
 Brittany : Bounced? Really? 
 Man : Yes, ma'am. 
 Can you give me a week? 
 Mm, no. 
 Three days? 
 Can't do it. 
 One day. 
 Sorry. 
 [click] 
 Hello? 
 [doorbell rings] 
 Aw, sh1t. 
 Miss Gold? 
 Mm-hmm. 
 These gentlemen will help you move. 
 Mm. 
 Come on in. 
 Perfect timing. 
 What's going on? 
 Let's go. 
 Good trip? 
 All I want to hear from you is we're all going to get this sh1t out of here. 
 Any issues? 
 No. Everything went real smooth. 
 Put the sh1t in the hull insulation. 
 When? 
 Soon. 
 What did I tell you about keeping this quiet? 
 I didn't tell nobody. 
 What about your lawyer? 
 He's not our f*cking lawyer. 
 You called him. 
 You went to his office. 
 I told you, we're witnesses in this bullshit insurance case. 
 Hold on. 
 How do you know we talked to him? Hmm? 
 You following us? 
 You bugging our phones, you f*ck? 
 It's like anything else. 
 You got to know who's on your team. 
 I like to keep a tab on my partners. 
 Don't you? 
 No. All I want to know is when we're going to get this sh1t off my boat. 
 Soon. 
 Very soon. 
 Lead counsel? 
 I started three months before you. 
 I... It's just for this one case. 
 For our biggest client. 
 Exactly, which is why I need your help. 
 Mr. Cooperman asked me to prepare all the discovery responses. 
 For real? I... Are you sure about this? 
 Do you want to read the emails again? 
 Please, can we get started? 
 There is so much work to do. 
 I can't. 
 I have work conflicts. 
 Yeah. I'm booked up, too. Sorry. 
 Wait. What? I need your help. 
 Okay? 
 What is the issue? 
 Oh. 
 You guys are afraid of alienating Callie. 
 I'll tell Mr. Cooperman you weren't being helpful. 
 Oh, you and Cooperman talk a lot? 
 In person? 
 You haven't even met him. 
 I'm in contact. 
 If you don't help me, I'll make sure you pay for it. 
 Ha ha. 
 You think I'm f*cking kidding? 
 This is... 
 This is my career here. 
 f*ck you, Lucy. 
 How can I help? 
 Thank you. 
 Just make sure Mr. Cooperman knows. 
 Start there. 
 [footsteps] 
 Oh, you're here? 
 Damn it. 
 I love you, too. 
 I was going to bring a friend up. 
 You can't afford your own room? 
 What are you, broke? 
 A little bit, yeah. 
 So you we're going to use my room? 
 Your office. 
 What... 
 I thought you'd be out. 
 Come on. I don't do it that often. 
 Yeah, but, honey, my office? 
 Seriously, what kind of freaky sh1t you got planned? 
 No, we... He enjoys the whole office scenario, all right? 
 He's like... He's like a CEO up north... 
 Uh, Silicon Valley. 
 Hi tech. 
 Bullshit. 
 Are you using again? 
 No. 
 Are you using again? 
 No. 
 No. 
 Make it the last time, okay? 
 Thank you. 
 We're representing a kid now. 
 We got to maintain some standards. 
 All right. 
 And by the way, you're depressed. 
 I'm fine. 
 No. 
 You're really f*cking depressed. 
 Uh, Father? 
 Yes. 
 Is that puke? 
 [sigh] 
 How may I help you? 
 I don't want to bother you. 
 I was just wondering if maybe you, uh, had a minute to talk to me. 
 Yes. Of course. 
 Great. 
 Now? 
 Yeah. 
 Right this way. 
 You have to clean this whole place? 
 Sometimes. No, we usually have help. 
 Really? 
 Everyone takes Sunday off. 
 And I'd love to take the day also... 
 Uh-huh. 
 [chuckle] You know. 
 You understand. 
 Yeah, of course. 
 I have done so many things for money, Father. 
 I've done things I can't even say out loud. 
 I can't even look at myself anymore. 
 I thought being here would help, but... 
 I hurt all the time. 
 I don't think I can do it anymore. 
 Do what? 
 Live. 
 I want to die, Father. 
 Last night I tried to kill myself. 
 Best... understand you are not alone. 
 You and I, we will get you through this, together with God. 
 But I've already prayed so much. 
 Yes. 
 But sometimes even our prayers are not enough. 
 God has given us signs and resources to help us. 
 You have an email address? 
 Yes. 
 I will make an appointment for you with Dr. James Wallace. 
 After Dr. Wallace sees you, he'll prescribe medicine and work with you. 
 In the meantime, I can forward you a list of some excellent websites and support groups that have done wonderful work with people in your same situation. 
 Believe me... 
 God's plan is not for you to die. 
 He loves you enough to forgive anything. 
 I am here for you 24 hours a day. 
 Don't hesitate to call.

 What in the... 
 [music stops] 
 What in the sh1t is going on? 
 What in the sh1t is this? 
 You said it would all be on a thumb drive. 
 Well, they decided to cornhole us and give us all the paper. 
 Oh, great. Okay. 
 I got a storage locker out in the Valley. 
 I got to go to the old house and get the key. 
 So I'll check you guys later. 
 You got to get that sh1t upstairs, okay? 
 I mean, I can get the key. 
 Billy, I can... I can get the key. 
 To the locker. f*ck. 
 All right. 
 Patty : Hey, eye on the prize, all right? 
 f*ck my life. 
 Oh, my God. 
 [sigh] I mean, look at this place. 
 How does this even happen to a person? 
 A little booze, a little weed. 
 What really happened to Billy was Sonny Wayne Bender. 
 Who? 
 Billy had never done a murder case. 
 Uh-huh. 
 It was on his bucket list. 
 He did too good of a job. 
 Got the case dismissed pre-trial. 
 Bad search. Never even got close to a jury. 
 Thing is, about a year or so later, Bender took out an entire family during a home invasion. 
 What? 
 Including three little kids. 
 Ohh. 
 How did I not know this? 
 Thanks to Donald Cooperman. 
 Since Billy got the case dismissed pre-trial, nobody knew he was involved. 
 All right? Cooperman made sure of it. 
 He didn't want the publicity for the firm. 
 Not exactly a plus for corporate clients. 
 So Billy blames himself. 
 His drinking got a lot worse. 
 Michelle left, and that's when the bottom fell out. 
 Cooperman broomed him after he went to sh1t. 
 Huh. 
 So wait. So then how did you and Billy hook up? 
 What? Did he represent you or something, or... 
 Story time's over, bitch. 
 This is bullshit. 
 I'm gonna leave. 
 They're not coming tonight. 
 No. He said wait. 
 I don't give a sh1t. 
 The guy's a f*cking ghost. 
 I don't like him. 
 I want this sh1t off my boat tomorrow at the latest. You tell him. 
 Why are you being like this? 
 All right, this is a good thing. 
 We just have to wait. 
 Gabriel, this is f*cked up. 
 I got to drive up to El Monte by 10 or... 
 [clatter] 
 You hear that? 
 What the f*ck was that? 
 Hang on. 
 Get against the wall! 
 [shouting] 
 Gabriel! Gabriel! Gabriel! 
 I don't f*cking know him. 
 [chatter] 
 For our subjects in custody. 
 [police radio chatter] 
 [handcuffs click] 
 It's me again. Where the hell are you anyway? 
 Denise is not home, and I got to get the key to the storage locker. 
 So here's what I'm gonna do.

 Everything else was locked up. 
 If the back door's locked, I'm gonna stick around a little bit. 
 Call me back, okay?

 Mmm. 
 Denise? Get your ass out here right now. 
 And bring that little prick with you. Now! 
 What the f*ck? 
 What are you doing? 
 What the f*ck are you doing? 
 What does it look like I'm doing? 
 I've been calling you. Where's Denise? 
 I got to get my key, the storage key. 
 I've been calling you. 
 I've called you a million f*cking times. 
 I need to get my key. 
 Oh, my f*cking God. 
 Jesus Christ. Wow. 
 Ohh! 
 m*therf*cker. 
 Tough day? 
 Yeah, a little bit. 
 Um... we're all still up there moving boxes, and we can use a little bit of help. 
 Yeah, well, I'm down here. 
 What's going on? 
 Nothing. 
 Just sitting here. 
 Okay. 
 Where do you want us to put the sh1t upstairs? 
 I don't know. Find a place. I got to see a guy. 
 Okay, Billy. 
 Billy : Father. 
 I figure you came to my place, so I thought I'd come see yours. 
 I have nothing to say to you, Mr. McBride. 
 Now please leave, or I'll have you arrested. 
 [chuckle] 
 You know, I've looked into a lot of eyeballs in my time. 
 I read them pretty well. 
 And when I look into yours, I see something. 
 You have information on Ryan Larson, and if you don't start talking, not only will I call your bishop, but I'll make things a mess for you... 
 I know absolutely nothing about what happened on that boat. 
 Neither do I. 
 That's what I'm trying to find out. 
 What I want to know from you is was he suicidal. 
 Did he appear to you to be suicidal? 
 I warned you. 
 I'm not asking... 
 You're not to be fooled by the collar. 
 Did you not take me seriously, Mr. McBride? 
 I don't think you take me seriously. 
 Get out. 
 I just... 
 Get... 
 Take your hand off me. 
 Get out! 
 Damn it. 
 Get out! 
 And don't you ever come back! 
 [scoff] 
 Yeah, you're a big man. 
 You can probably beat me to death if you wanted to. I get that. 
 But I got other ways of whipping people's asses, too, and you might not like it. 
 Just one more thing, and I'll get out of here, all right? 
 If Ryan Larson was suicidal, you would have done something about it. 
 You would have hooked him up with some kind of health professional or some kind of group, a shrink, some kind of doctor... 
 Maybe Dr. Wallace. I hear he's good. 
 And at the very least, you would have treated him the same as you would some common hooker who walked in here off the street. 
 I will search Ryan Larson's computer. 
 And I will get a court order to search yours. 
 You can believe that. 
 All I'm asking for is your humble opinion. 
 The truth's big to you, I'm sure. 
 I understand the position you're in. I really do. 
 But there's a kid who doesn't have a father anymore. 
 I just want you to tell me what you think, Father. 
 Do you think he was suicidal? 
 Do you think Ryan Larson's suicidal? 
 That's all... 
 No. 
 He was not. 
 I'm late for a meeting. I got to go. 
 You don't return calls. That's not like you. 
 Not having any regrets, are you? 
 I don't have anything to regret. 
 No. You don't. 
 Your ex-husband needs to learn some boundaries. 
 You need to learn some boundaries. 
 He's invasive. 
 Shouldn't be stalking you like that. 
 Oh, please. He's not a stalker. 
 He's a schmuck. 
 He was just looking for Denise or something. 
 Thank God she was on a school trip. 
 The look on his face was priceless. 
 You really enjoyed that, didn't you? 
 Yeah. I did. 
 I take my pleasure where I can get it, particularly after having to deal with him in court. 
 Please stop. I don't want to hear one more thing about the Borns Tech case, nothing about Billy, nothing, got it? 
 Good. 
 Good. 
 Hey. 
 You and I, we're okay, right? 
 Yeah. We're the same as always. 
 I wish you were a nicer person. 
 I wish everybody in my life was nicer. 
 I am very nice to you. 
 You're so bad.

 Hey, Patty. 
 Hey. [cough] 
 Hi. 
 How you doing? 
 Do you live here? 
 Oh, God, no. This is my in-laws' house. 
 It's my ex-in-laws' house on my... on my second husband's side. 
 What's up? 
 Sis, you all right? 
 Yeah, Milos, I'm fine, yeah. 
 You sure? 
 Yeah. 
 Hey, how you doing? I'm Billy McBride. 
 Milos. 
 Nice to meet you. 
 Yeah. 
 Hey, listen, stick around. 
 We got some boxes to move later. 
 You can probably help us with that. 
 I'm fine. Thank you. 
 That's scary. 
 He's sweet, though. He's a sweet kid, yeah. 
 Doesn't look sweet. 
 He doesn't know his own strength. 
 It's a problem sometimes. 
 What is he, your cousin or something? 
 What's his deal? 
 Uh, cousin-ish... Ex-cousin-ish. 
 So that's kind of what I wanted to hear. 
 Hey, Milos. 
 What are you doing?
