 Let me ask you a question. 
  How long do you look at your cards before you tell me how many you want? 
  I mean, I'm-I'm not trying to be an asshole. 
  I'm just asking. 
  - You got someplace to be? 
  - No, no. 
  Chief, I'm-I'm here for you. 
  (SIGHS) 
  But, you know, those cards aren't gonna change. 
  They're gonna stay the same till you tell me how many you want. 
  Just like to think things over, that's all. 
  - Good. 
  Good. 
  - To ruminate. 
  - (WILLIE LAUGHS) 
  - (MICKEY SIGHS) 
  Okay. 
  You ruminate, chief. 
  JENNIFER: I'm very good. 
  People make, like, hundreds of thousands of dollars from playing this. 
  (LAUGHING) 
  You're so st You're so dumb. 
  JENNIFER: Nah. 
  This is, like, a competitive sport. 
  Oh, yeah. 
  Mm-hmm. 
  High IQ. 
  MICKEY: You ever overhear these people talk about dying? 
  Like, they were dead for a minute or five minutes or whatever. 
  For every one of them, there's six others that have a wreck motorcycle or whatever (SIGHS) 
  they're in a coma for a month or six months. 
  They wake up, they don't remember sh1t. 
  They just remember they cranked up their bike, next thing, nothing. 
  Just some nurse cleaning up their sh1t, poking them all over. 
  (HIGH-PITCHED): "Mr. Smith, Mr. Smith, "you're in the hospital. 
  "You had an accident. Tell me how many f*cking fingers I'm holding up. " (CHUCKLES) 
  - Give me two. 
  - You got it. 
  Two for the chief. 
  - One for the dealer. 
  - (POKER CHIPS CLINKING) 
  Let's see. 
  Let's see what you got. 
  Three cowboys. 
  MICKEY: Jesus Christ. 
  You waited that long, and you're holding three kings? 
  f*ck. 
  I got sh1t. 
  Anyway, it's obvious the brain runs the whole operation. 
  It's got a f*cking switch, you know? 
  Come to papa. 
  It's off, you're dead. 
  You don't exist anymore. 
  Some doctors go in and fool around a little bit, (POPS LIPS) 
  you're back. 
  Mickey! Shut it! Hey, man, don't you get tired of hearing yourself talk about stuff that nobody's interested in? 
  I'm tired of being the only smart guy in the room. 
  - All right? 
  - Oh, God! Everywhere I go, nobody wants to listen. 
  Listen, are you gonna be a baby if I try to f*ck the Chinese chick? 
  Huh? 
  - Shut up. 
  - What? 
  Are you? 
  Huh? 
  Gonna make a difference if I am? 
  - No. 
  - (CHUCKLES) 
  But I want you on board, you know. 
  I want you supporting me, you know. 
  - Be nice. 
  - I don't give a sh1t. 
  That's the way it is, with the brain. 
  Once it's off, you're out. 
  No more. 
  No more Frankie and Susie, you know? 
  Gone. 
  Hey, man, you're playing cards, right? 
  Why don't you stick to talking about cards? 
  As long as you got pussy and a cheeseburger, you're good, right, Willie? 
  Yeah, man, I got mine. 
  Oh, I want a cheeseburger. 
  (GASPS) 
  I want a cheeseburger! There's no cheeseburgers in Mexico. 
  I told you already. 
  - Go find - Stop that. 
  Stop that. 
  You're driving me nuts with that. 
  See what you did? 
  (CLEARS THROAT) 
  They won't let you take me to Applebee's. 
  - What? 
  - They said you can't take me. 
  But then they said they don't even have Applebee's here. 
  Isn't that funny? 
  - Who? 
  - What? 
  Who said that? 
  Those people. 
  The-the people in the room. 
  (GROANS SOFTLY) 
  Wait, wait. 
  Where are you going? 
  I'm gonna go find out who the hell you are and what's going on. 
  WILLIE: Oh. 
  Oh, boy. 
  Oh, my goodness. 
  Look at that. 
  MICKEY: Yeah, always calm, you know. 
  - Wow, you're so f*cking limber. 
  - Collected. 
  MICKEY: So, that's yours. 
  - WILLIE: You are so f*ck.

  WILLIE: That is so f*cking nuts. 
  Way so f*cking fle-flexible.

  - Take it home for grandma. 
  - There you go. 
  - A new pair of shoes, baby. 
  - New pair of shoes. 
  That's it. 
  Guys, um, I must've been really shit-faced last night or something, 'cause I got no memory of how this deal went down. 
  So if you could fill me in, I'd appreciate it. 
  - One second. 
  One sec. 
  Go ahead. 
  - Geez. 
  - Hey, man. 
  - f*cking pay attention. 
  That-that Chinese girlfriend you had, did she go back to sleep? 
  If you're talking about the girl back there, she ain't my girlfriend, no. 
  - What? 
  - I got no f*cking clue who she is. 
  So that's kind of what I'm getting at here, you know. 
  Oh, you had a clue last night, man. 
  You definitely did. 
  Yeah, well, I don't know about that. 
  Yeah. 
  What? 
  Shut up. 
  I'm just kidding. 
  I'm kidding. 
  - MAN: Don't f*cking cheat me, man. 
  - BILLY: Hey, dude. 
  - MICKEY: I'm not trying to make trouble. 
  - Excuse me. 
  I'm not trying to make you upset. 
  - What's going on, man? 
  - WILLIE: Yeah, we don't know. 
  We don't know. 
  Do we know anything? 
  - I swear. 
  - That's yours. 
  WILLIE: So, wait, she's not your girlfriend? 
  No, like I said, no. 
  No, I don't know the girl. 
  You see? 
  Look, guys, no disrespect intended, but who the f*ck are you and why am I here? 
  - We're government. 
  - What government? 
  Valkenvania. 
  - Valkenvania. 
  - (JENNIFER LAUGHING) 
  - (CHUCKLES): Okay. 
  - We're here to protect you. 
  - All right. 
  - All the information you got, you got from us. 
  Now you know too much. 
  WILLIE: Valkenvania. 
  MICKEY: The Russians, the Americans, - everybody's looking for you. 
  - Are they? 
  Yeah. 
  Okay. 
  All right, then. 
  Read you loud and clear. 
  Mm-hmm. 
  Come on, guys. 
  Cut the sh1t. 
  Seriously, wh-what's going on? 
  Is that an attitude that I heard just then? 
  No, he just doesn't remember sh1t. 
  I think I heard a little attitude. 
  I-I Look, man, what kind of attitude would you have if you didn't know where the f*ck you were? 
  I frankly don't give a f*ck. 
  You're gonna be here a while, so just dig yourself, make yourself comfortable. 
  Everybody's being very nice to you right now. 
  - Okay.

  WILLIE: Why are you being like this? 
  Why? 
  Huh?

  That's all, relax. 
  Settle in. 
  Everybody settle in. 
  MICKEY: All right. 
  If you want to you I'll give you this game. 
  - If you want it, you got it. 
  - Yeah. 
  So, your friend's out front there? 
  There's bars on the windows, people outside. 
  - You're not going anywhere, pal. 
  - Uh-huh. 
  All right? 
  Just settle in. 
  We'll let you know when your time's up. 
  We'll let you know when you can step out. 
  All right? 
  Unless you want us to tie you up. 
  Yeah. 
  No, I'm not big on being tied up. 
  MAN: (SCOFFS) 
  All right, then just go back to your chick in there or whatever. 
  Be comfortable. 
  Take it easy. 
  WILLIE: Yeah, yeah, and stop asking questions. 
  MICKEY: So, that's 460, right? 
  WILLIE: This-this guy here, Mickey, he'll answer all your questions, and you really don't want to hear that. 
  MICKEY: Hey, f*ck off, Willie. 
  We're just playing cards, all right? 
  MAN: Let's go another round, all right? 
  MICKEY: All right. 
  Okay. 
  So, I had a had a phone on me and a pack of smokes. 
  You guys know anything about that? 
  You shouldn't smoke. 
  It's bad for you health. 
  You should quit. 
  Yeah, well, I-I do smoke, so You better just, you know, walk away before your medical condition has a change of status. 
  Don't do that. 
  It's you. 
  MICKEY: That blows it for you. 
  MAN: What? 
  I didn't do anything.

  - Fair and square, right? 
  - JENNIFER: Shut up. 
  WILLIE: The Chinese chick. 
  Come on, what? 
  JENNIFER: I don't give a sh1t. 
  I already told you. 
  So, what's your name, anyway? 
  Janet. 
  I don't look like a Janet. 
  (CHUCKLES) 
  What's your name? 
  That's not important. 
  Start laughing. 
  - What? 
  - Just start laughing. 
  Why? 
  'Cause we're having fun, just hanging out, okay? 
  - Okay.

  Oh, okay. 
  (LAUGHS LOUDLY) 
  No, no. 
  Okay, forget it. 
  Okay, I-I need you to tell me what happened and how we got here. 
  I don't know. 
  I mean, you know as much as I do. 
  We were in a bar, and you were asking me for a ride to the border. 
  That's right. 
  But the guy that I was with, who brought me there, he just he got pissed off for some reason, he just left. 
  Oh, no, wait. 
  (CHUCKLES) 
  You were not very nice to him. 
  And he said he was gonna kick your ass. 
  And then you said, "Oh, yeah? 
  Well, I'm gonna cut  
  - your f*cking throat."  
  - Shh. 
  You were really drunk. 
  I mean, really drunk. 
  - Yeah, okay. 
  All right, enough. 
  - (LAUGHS LOUDLY) 
  Shut up. 
  I said you don't have to do that anymore, okay? 
  - Oh, I'm sorry. 
  Okay. 
  Okay. 
  - Okay? 
  So, what else? 
  I don't know. 
  I just I woke up on this bed next to you. 
  I-I tried to wake you up, but you were, like, dead. 
  Except for the weird-ass noises you make. 
  Do you have any idea? 
  Like, it's just Yeah, okay, okay. 
  Come on. 
  Tell me the rest. 
  Then I went in there, and, uh, they weren't they weren't very talkative. 
  Except for the guy and the girl.

  Willie was his name. 
  He wants me he wants me to give him a blow job. 
  Right in front of her he's saying that. 
  Right so creepy. 
  Pipe down. 
  (QUIETLY): Then one of them said Yeah, they said one of them said they're waiting for the word. 
  "So stop f*cking asking me. 
  " I've got to ask you 'cause I got to figure this sh1t out, okay? 
  Oh, no. 
  Not-not you. 
  One of them said, "So stop f*cking asking me. 
  " Okay. 
  So, what word? 
  I don't know. 
  (SIGHS) 
  You know what, I don't like blowjobs so much. 
  I mean, I guess they're okay, but not really. 
  And cum smells like poppies. 
  No, no, no, not poppies. 
  Tulips. 
  Next time you're in a flower garden, smell the tulips. 
  Anything else? 
  Nope, just tulips. 
  No, anything else about what they said in there? 
  Don't know. 
  I-I don't They just sit around playing cards and argue about stuff. 
  And you swear to God you don't know these people? 
  You've never seen them in your life, right? 
  No. 
  Excuse me? 
  I don't Why would I? 
  Do you know them? 
  Uh, no. 
  It's just that you seem to remember a lot about what went on at the bar. 
  I don't remember a f*cking thing. 
  Well, maybe I'm a little I won't say it. 
  Maybe I'm brighter than you. 
  I don't know. 
  (SNIFFS) 
  Probably not. 
  - (LAUGHS) 
  Anyway Shh. 
  - Look at me. 
  Anyway, listen to me. 
  Anything I tell you to do, just do it. 
  - Okay. 
  - Every now and then, go in there, just hang out with them. 
  Okay? 
  - Okay.

  A little peck on the mouth.

  I told him I wasn't dying to see it. 
  Yeah, I don't blame you. 
  Listen. 
  I want you to keep it up with him, okay? 
  I mean, keep shutting him down, but just flirt with him a little bit, just enough. 
  Just enough to keep him semi-interested. 
  All right? 
  What? 
  Why? 
  Why? 
  - (GROANS SOFTLY) 
  - Trust me. 
  (SIGHS) 
  Okay. 
  How about the rest of them, what are they doing? 
  Um, bald guy's reading a magazine. 
  And the girl's just sitting there. 
  I think she's playing a game on her phone. 
  The creep is on the couch next to her. 
  But I didn't see the crazy guy. 
  I did hear some snoring in the other room, though, so I guess that's him. 
  Yeah.

  What happened? 
  (STEADY BREATHING) 
  (TRAIN WHISTLE BLOWS) 
  (GASPS) 
  Oh, great. 
  I didn't want to wake you up, but I'm glad you woke up, though. 
  - I heard something. 
  - What? 
  I went in the hallway last night. 
  You were asleep, and I heard them talking, but it wasn't too loud, so I snuck in and I was against the wall, like, really flat like this. 
  And Mickey, he said, "Where are they dropping them off?" No, no, wait, I'm sorry. 
  The, um, wait. 
  It's the bald guy, the bald guy. 
  They still haven't said his name. 
  He said he got the call. 
  And then Mickey said that about, you know, "Where are they dropping them off?" Then the other guy said, "No, it's changed. 
  We're supposed to finish the deal. 
  " Then this morning, they-they, they started getting, like, really busy and-and-and taking things outside and they were coming in and out, and I saw Mickey. 
  He was talking to three guys in a black car because I saw through-through the door when they opened it just for a minute. 
  And then, um, I saw through that door that, uh, Mickey was loading some bags into a truck. 
  They were really busy, and-and they were kind of intense and-and arguing. 
  Mickey and the bald guy. 
  And they said, "When it gets dark" something. 
  - What? 
  - I couldn't hear what  
  (WILLIE CLEARS THROAT) 
  Uh-huh. 
  What's up? 
  Not much. 
  Too early to tell yet. 
  How 'bout you? 
  (LAUGHS): Chinese chicks. 
  - So what do you  
  - Close the door. 
  Quietly. 
  So what do you think? 
  What do you think that means? 
  Okay. 
  I want you to listen to me very carefully, all right? 
  - Okay. 
  - All right. 
  In a little while, I want you to go in there, and I want you to sit down with him just like usual, all right? 
  Okay. 
  You know, resist that creep and everything, but you know, be a little flirtatious  
  - with him, you know. 
  - Okay, okay. 
  - Just keep flirting with him. 
  - Okay. 
  - Until I get in there. 
  - Okay. 
  - I'm gonna come in there. 
  - Yeah. 
  And I'm gonna ask the girl to make me some tea. 
  Okay. 
  - When she does, - Mm-hmm. 
  - And hopefully she will - Yeah. 
  look over at me. 
  - Okay. 
  - And if I give you the nod Uh-huh. 
  you tell him you want to see that dick thing of his, whatever it is, the curve or whatever. 
  - Okay Yeah. 
  - Got me? 
  And then I want you to bring him back here. 
  - Here? 
  - Bring him back yes. 
  - Bring him back here - In this, this room? 
  - And get him on the bed. 
  - Okay. 
  Now, once you get his pants down Oh, no, I can't blow this guy. 
  Hey, listen to me, goddamn it. 
  Listen to me. 
  Do you want to f*cking die, or you want to blow that creep? 
  - No, okay-okay. 
  - Huh? 
  I'd blow him myself, but I don't think he'd be interested. 
  Okay, okay. 
  I got it. 
  Okay. 
  So anyway, you get him relaxed, you f*ck around with him and everything. 
  When you get him all readied up and he's all into it and all this kind of thing, right under that blanket wedged in the mattress right there, there's a knife, okay? 
  A long knife. 
  Now I want you Don't f*ck with it.

  Okay. 
  Just find an opportunity, okay? 
  - Okay. 
  - When you get the opportunity, I want you to take the knife, I want you to jam it right up through his balls  
  - No. 
  No. 
  - Listen to me. 
  As hard as you can,  
  - right up into him. 
  - Oh, my God. 
  I want you to bury it in him, do you understand me? 
  Bury it in him and, immediately, pull it out. 
  - Don't forget that part. 
  - You do that part.

  Did your dad get home okay? 
  I was gonna ask you the same question. 
  He didn't come home with you? 
  When he heard about Julio, he started drinking. 
  He felt very self-destructive and I couldn't help him. 
  He just took a bottle and left. 
  I don't know where he went. 
  I'm sure he's okay. 
  Just let me know if you hear anything from him. 
  Sure. 
  Thank you. 
  Well, hello. 
  Hi. 
  Did you speak to Senator Briggs about your new job? 
  Yeah. 
  Good. 
  What's on your mind?

  The meetings, the weird phone calls,  
  - the guy with the hook. 
  - Well, Elena, you have to play the game to win. 
  Oh, I know you're gonna win. 
  There's no doubt. 
  But I know you're a fraud. 
  Look, I understand you're upset about being let go. 
  I spoke to your old elementary school teacher. 
  Mm. 
  In your hometown. 
  Sister Maria Isabella? 
  The sister knew you by a different name. 
  Claudia Quintero. 
  - That name means nothing to me. 
  - Right. 
  Because Claudia Quintero doesn't exist in any public record. 
  It's like she's a ghost. 
  You're very nosy, Elena. 
  Do you want money? 
  No. 
  So why are you doing this? 
  Because I believed in you. 
  You were gonna do great things. 
  I am gonna do great things. 
  No. 
  Because you don't give a sh1t about your community. 
  How dare you say that to me. 
  Who are you?

  You don't have to apologize. 
  I just can't believe he killed himself. 
  He was about to get out. 
  You never know what people are thinking. 
  I just keep thinking about how desperate he must've felt. 
  (SIGHS) 
  'Cause I've had those thoughts.
