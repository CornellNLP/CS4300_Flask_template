  (JULIO SIGHS) 
  He was a good man. 
  And there's an asshole on every corner out there still breathing. 
  You know who did it? 
  Well, the cops think it was Marcos's crew. 
  Yeah. 
  Yeah, it's retaliation because they think I killed Marcos. 
  - My dad is dead because of me. 
  - No. 
  - No, it's my fault that my dad died. 
  - No, it's not. 
  It's not your fault. 
  It's whoever killed Marcos's fault, okay? 
  Do you hear me?

  So, what happens now? 
  Well I want to take your case if you still want me to. 
  Okay. 
  So, yes? 
  - Yes. 
  - Okay. 
  Well, the next thing is, uh, we'll have a preliminary hearing. 
  And that'll determine whether or not they think they have enough evidence to take it to trial. 
  If they don't, then it's done. 
  - And I get out? 
  - Absolutely. 
  But where do I go? 
  I don't know, son.

  (UPBEAT DANCE MUSIC PLAYING) 
  IRENE: And the anesthetic, they're supposed to make it where you don't feel. 
  Believe me, I felt it. 
  Then he goes to remove the bunion, and he says to me, "Would you like to keep it as a souvenir? 
 " - (LAUGHTER) 
  - This is a joke. 
  This is no joke to me. 
  Only God and I know the pain I've been suffering. 
  - Yeah. 
  - Show him. 
  - Show him. 
  - Don't show him. 
  BILLY: No, ma'am, you don't have to do that. 
  - I believe you. 
  - Don't show him. 
  Oh, that's okay. 
  You don't have to. 
  - Five days. 
  - I-I believe you. 
  IRENE: It's been five days. 
  Just killing me. 
  Can't you see it on my face? 
  Yes, ma'am. 
  Absolutely. 
  - I saw it already. 
  - Did you see it? 
  Do we have a case, Billy? 
  Do we have a case here? 
  Well, I don't I haven't really handled a bunion case before, - so I'm not sure. 
  - Well, it's been five days, - maybe more. 
  - PATTY: He can't help her. 
  He can't help her. 
  Sit down. 
  Sit down. 
  Ah, listen. 
  I have a good real estate business we can run together. 
  - No! 
  (SPEAKS ARMENIAN) 
  - (OTHERS GROANING, CHATTERING) 
  That's the real estate girl, real estate person. 
  Not really me. 
  (CHUCKLES) 
  - PATTY: Oh. 
  (MUMBLES) 
  - BILLY: Here you go. 
  - PATTY: Jesus Christ. 
  - (SIREN WAILING IN DISTANCE) 
  - Um, all right. 
  - Here, I got you. 
  Thank you. 
  I better, um Thank you. 
  I better get back in there, so What's up? 
  Well, I-I want to get this out right away. 
  Uh, just want you to know I hired Brittany back, just to do some paperwork and stuff. 
  I mean, I think it's deeply stupid, but - (BILLY MUTTERS) 
  - I mean, I don't care. 
  It's got nothing to do with me. 
  Yeah, well To me, I think that about the only thing that's not forgivable is murder. 
  Anything else I'd say you can forgive people for. 
  I don't care. 
  I mean, I It's-it's your business. 
  Oh, I got my reasons. 
  (SIREN WAILING IN DISTANCE) 
  - Oh. 
  - (SNIFFLES) 
  You remember Oscar, right? 
  From Chez Jay, the kitchen guy? 
  Oh, yeah. 
  Nice guy with the hair nets. 
  - Yeah. 
  - Yeah. 
  Well, his sons they're, uh, they're gangbangers, and they've been gangbangers for a while, and they got in the middle of some bad sh1t - and got themselves killed. 
  - Oh. 
  His little kid, the fresh-faced one used to come in the bar all the time, you know? 
  - I remember, yeah. 
  - Little kid. 
  Yeah. 
  He gets arrested for taking care of the guys that got his brothers. 
  Some kind of retaliation supposedly. 
  Not such a great kid then, huh? 
  Well, no, I think he is, actually. 
  At least I think it's worth looking into. 
  (SIGHS) 
  Anyhow Oscar is the kid's only alibi. 
  He was home at the time, and Oscar was gonna go to court, you know, testify for the kid. 
  And, uh anyway, he left, and, uh, was headed back to Chez Jay, and I heard some gunshots, and, uh, ran outside, and, uh Oscar was laying in the parking lot. 
  So now the kid's got nobody. 
  His dad's dead, his brothers are dead, and he's in jail for murder. 
  It looks like he's going down. 
  So I took the case. 
  And I need your help. 
  Just look, y-you don't have to deal with Brittany. 
  Like I said, she'll stay a hundred yards away from you all the time. 
  - No. 
  - She's just doing paperwork for me. 
  Okay, Brittany aside, my life, it's-it's - it's full right now. 
  - Yeah. 
  Okay? 
  If you knew the sh1t that I have to deal with right now Look, could you just hear me out, please? 
  But even wait even if I was just sitting on my ass all day, right, I cannot, under any circumstances, do another case right now. 
  I can't. 
  I mean, the last one nearly killed us. 
  You know that. 
  And a murder case? 
  Really? 
  Why would you do that? 
  Yeah, I know. 
  Believe me, I thought about that. 
  Look, I was holding the guy's hand when he died. 
  Okay? 
  That does something to you. 
  And if I've got any passion for doing this sh1t left in me at all, this is where I need to use it. 
  I get it. 
  And I'm-I'm I really am sorry, but I can't do it. 
  Yep. 
  Could you do me another favor on a different subject? 
  Yeah. 
  Could you call me sometimes? 
  I haven't heard from you, you know. 
  I mean, come see me sometime even, have a drink with me. 
  Yes, I will come and see you, and we will have a cola. 
  - Okay? 
  - Okay. 
  Okay. 
  - It was very nice seeing you. 
  - It was good to see you. 
  PATTY: All right, well, let me ask you this. 
  Let me ask you this: Who set you up with your third wife? 
  This guy, right? 
  Because we're friends. 
  And that's why I'm gonna give you a break on the first six months - Cigarette? 
  - Yeah, let me get a cigarette. 
  On the first six months if you sign for three years. 
  What's the problem? 
  They each have their own tent. 
  It's rustic, Carl! 
  All right, listen. 
  You change your mind, all right, you give me a call today. 
  If not, I-I got a lot of people looking at this space. 
  All right? 
  Bye. 
  You know why you're having trouble renting this place? 
  - Why's that? 
  - 'Cause you don't have free Wi-Fi. 
  You're absolutely right. 
  I usually am. 
  You know, I was talking to my psychic friend about you today. 
  Great. 
  She says you're unhappy. 
  She says she sees more for you. 
  So do I. 
  You have a chartreuse aura about you today. 
  - Chartreuse. 
  - Yeah. 
  Green and yellow. 
  It's like, money and happiness is coming your way. 
  All right. 
  Maybe even some dick. 
  Maybe, Tish. 
  Maybe. 
  - Want a snack? 
  - Yeah. 
  What do you got? 
  (BAG RUSTLING) 
  - Oh, that's nice.

  - Trudy? 
  - No. 
  Trudy. 
  Brittany. 
  Um, I want to have no contact with her whatsoever, okay? 
  At all. 
  I'm gonna help you, but if it turns into a f*cking nightmare, I'm out. 
  That's the deal. 
  Okay? 
  - Deal? 
  - Absolutely. 
  - Okay. 
  - Cool. 
  It's pro bono. 
  I forgot to tell you that part.

  What's going on? 
  I don't know what that is. 
  Um look, so, I know that you can just go buy more, or have a drink at the bar that you practically live at, but I'm really hoping that this will cause you to stop and think next time you're gonna drink.

  I'm doing this 'cause I care about you.

  Why not?

  (SIGHS) 
  What's wrong with you? 
  Nothing. 
  Just getting geared up, that's all. 
  Morning, Billy. 
  So you decided to take the case. 
  Yeah. 
  Hope you're ready. 
  Who was that? 
  That's the prosecution. 
  He's, like, super attractive, right? 
  I've been up against him before. 
  - We should go. 
  - And? 
  It's a long story. 
  I'll tell you later. 
  - Tell me now. 
  - We got a hearing, honey. 
  - I don't want to tell you now. 
  - Talk fast. 
  Tell me now. 
  MARVA: Julio was at home that evening practicing his cello in his room. 
  His father, Oscar, was downstairs, and HAKEEM: Your Honor, this is, this is hearsay from a non-percipient witness. 
  BILLY: This is reliable hearsay, Your Honor. 
  - I'm a notary public. 
  - Look, I'm sure Mrs. 
  Jefferson is a, is a wonderful notary public, but the question here is whether what Mr. 
  Suarez told her is reliable. 
  - Mr. 
  McBride? 
  - BILLY: This is not a trial. 
  There's no jury. 
  The court can hear inherently reliable evidence. 
  WALLACE: Mr. 
  McBride, the state has a point. 
  They cannot cross-examine Mr. 
  Suarez. 
  What makes this testimony trustworthy? 
  Your Honor, Julio Suarez is a really good kid. 
  His academics are pristine. 
  He's lost his father, he's lost his brothers. 
  - Please don't make him lose his alibi. 
  - HAKEEM: An alibi, Your Honor, by a man who's willing to say anything to save his son's life is not trustworthy. 
  The burden of proof is on the state. 
  - What did they put up today? 
  - We have motive. 
  Okay? 
  His brothers were supposedly killed by the victim. 
  We have an eyewitness that places the defendant - at the scene. 
  - This is all speculation. 
  Marcos PeÃ±a was a known gang member. 
  He's got a lot of enemies. 
  And in terms of this so-called eyewitness, he was across the street, under the overpass, walking his dog. 
  His view was obstructed. 
  It was late at night. 
  There were barely any streetlights. 
  Finally, they got no murder weapon or any physical evidence whatsoever to tie Julio to the crime scene. 
  WALLACE: This is inadmissible hearsay. 
  The witness is excluded. 
  - You can step down. 
  - Okay. 
  Mr. 
  Rashad, do you have anything else? 
  Yes, yes. 
  Um, we actually do. 
  We just received some footage from a security camera from one of the the neighbor's house down the street. 
  - Do you mind if we play it? 
  - Mm. 
  Go ahead. 
  So, the time code is gonna be 9:23 p. 
  m. 
  That was just moments after the murders occurred. 
  And that is Julio Suarez. 
  That is Julio Suarez, who is clearly not at home with his father, playing the cello. 
  It seems that there is a handgun, not a cello, in Julio's waistband, as he runs from the scene of the murders. 
  That went pretty well, yeah? 
  I happen to know that, without a murder weapon, you can never count Billy McBride out. 
  So find it. 
  Get back to your office. 
  I need you to contact I didn't do it. 
  I swear. 
  Well, we just saw videotape of you running away with a gun. 
  But I didn't kill anybody. 
  Do you want to spend the rest of your life in prison? 
  If you lie to me, that's what's gonna happen to you. 
  You're gonna spend the rest of your f*cking life in jail. 
  - Think about that. 
  - We're not gonna get anywhere until you tell us the truth. 
  Do you understand that? 
  What's the story with the tape? 
  I was at Marcos's place. 
  Right. 
  Why were you there? 
  I was I was gonna kill Marcos, but I heard some gunshots, then I ran away. 
  Where's the gun? 
  I threw it in the ocean. 
  I ran home, and then I went into my room, - but I couldn't do it. 
  - Julio. 
  Don't ever lie to me again. 
  Do you understand that? 
  Yes, sir. 
  Now, what about the gunshots? 
  You get a look at the guy? 
  I didn't see his face. 
  Well, was he Hispanic or white or black or what? 
  - He-he was Hispanic. 
  - Good. 
  He-he was short and - I mean, he was really short. 
  - What else? 
  - That's it. 
  - That's it? 
  Yeah. 
  I know how bad this looks. 
  Goddamn right, it does. 
  (DUCKS QUACKING) 
  What the f*ck is this? 
  This is for one guy. 
  I don't do two-for-one specials. 
  Keep your voice down. 
  Yeah. 
  Well, nobody told you to, okay? 
  This was one and done. 
  Just blondie. 
  You want problems? 
  That's fine. 
  I can make problems. 
  Trust me, nobody here wants problems. 
  Then you're half short. 
  - Who's short? 
  - Try me, pendejo. 
  Okay. 
  I'll get you the rest of the money when you give me the gun. 
  (SCOFFS) 
  I f*cking tossed it, ese. 
  You told me to get rid of it. 
  Right. 
  And now I'm telling you I need it. 
  Well, I threw it in some Dumpster. 
  Which f*cking Dumpster? 
  I don't f*cking know.

  - Yeah. 
  So you come to a-an expert. 
  (BOTH LAUGH) 
  You want a chaparro, a cabrÃ³n negrito. 
  You know, I know 200 guys that fit that description. 
  - I know. 
  - It's not a, not a lot to go on. 
  I'm sorry, bud, that's all I got. 
  Well, I will work my people. 
  - They are there for me. 
  - Cool. 
  - See what I can do. 
  Yeah. 
  - Okay. 
  - Hey, Billy. 
  - Yeah. 
 
 
 
  Don't go in the ocean. 
  Lot of chatter on the Coast Guard radio about chum in the water. 
  - You know what I mean? 
  - No. 
  Evidently, the, uh, drug cartel dumped a bunch of bodies and body parts in the a little close to the shore, so, uh, watch out for sharks, Billy. 
  Appreciate the advice. 
  All right, man. 
  Love you, buddy. 
  - I love you.

  Miss Silva. 
  - There she is. 
  - (REPORTERS CLAMORING) 
  - Miss Silva. 
  Excuse me. 
  Councilwoman. 
  Did you visit Julio Suarez in jail? 
  What is your relationship with Julio Suarez? 
  - And how long have you known him? 
  - Do you think he's guilty? 
  In fact, do you think he's a killer? 
  The only reason this case has gotten so much attention is because a white kid from Brentwood was killed. 
  And it's easy to blame the brown kid and chalk it up into gang violence, but That's why the community center is so important, for these kids to know they have people who believe in them, just like I believe in Julio Suarez. 
  (REPORTERS CLAMORING) 
  - Wait! 
  - No more questions. 
  (PEOPLE SCREAMING PLAYFULLY) 
  (TRAFFIC PASSING) 
  Hola. 
  - Hola, Billy. 
  - What's up, honey? 
  How you doing? 
  Sorry. 
  Uh, that's my upbringing. 
  - We call everybody "honey. 
  " - (BOTH CHUCKLE) 
  - I think it's cute. 
  - Yeah. 
  Uh, not much. 
  I've just been here waiting for you for, like, two hours, I think. 
  - Well, do you want to come up? 
  Come on. 
  - Yeah. 
  I You know, the-the kids at the community center - signed this card for Julio. 
  - Yeah. 
  - Come on, let's go, let's go. 
  - Yeah, and, uh, I was thinking that you could deliver this to him, now that you're his lawyer. 
  - You heard about that, huh? 
  - Yes, and I'm so happy. 
  (LAUGHS) 
  Stop it. 
  I feel much better about everything. 
  - Yeah? 
  - Yes. 
  Good. 
  - So, uh, would you give it to him? 
  - Of course. 
  - Yeah, yeah. 
  It's no sweat. 
  - I-I would, but No, I get it. 
  Next time I see him, I'll give it to him. 
  Thank you. 
  Sorry, I-I haven't called you about the drink, I know. 
  No, you never have. 
  I got some glasses in there. 
  I mean, can't promise you how clean they are. 
  I don't care. 
  I can drink out of a bottle behind closed doors. 
  I'm f*cked, aren't I? 
  We are both f*cked. 
  Come on, let's go. 
  Okay. 
  One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine. 
  - Let's go. 
  - Geez, what do you want? 
  - Come on, let's go. 
  - Hey. 
  Ow. 
  You want to tell me what's going on? 
  Quiet. 
  I'm going.

  (SCOFFS) 
  Jesus, Gabriel. 
  You scared the sh1t out of me. 
  How are you, my friend? 
  GABRIEL: Me, uh, I'm not a gym person, you know? 
  I like to be outside in the fresh air. 
  Listen, if this is about, uh Let me finish, Tom. 
  You know I don't like to be interrupted. 
  I'm sorry. 
  Of course. 
  I need you to focus, Tom. 
  You said everything was under control, and it's not. 
  The DEA is getting too close. 
  And I hear this high-profile lawyer Billy McBride's on the case. 
  Now, this is the kind of attention I don't want. 
  - Do you understand? 
  - Hey, I a hundred percent agree. 
  - And I-I promise you, this is - Oh, enough with the promises. 
  Get Marisol Silva under control. 
  I will, but if you could Tom, interrupt me again. 
  Get Marisol Silva to shut her mouth. 
  We need the kid to be convicted so this investigation is over, you understand? 
  You give me two days, you won't even know this ever happened. 
  I'm telling you, you give Tom Wyatt two - (LINE CLICKS, BEEPS)

  Some creepy f*ck with a f*cking hook hand - just kidnapped me. 
  f*ck!

  Who? 
  I-I don't know. 
  It was one of Gabriel's f*cking guys, and he said he's gonna kill me. 
  - f*cking dead! 
  - Okay, okay. 
  Calm-calm down. 
  - What did he say? 
  What did he say? 
  - f*ck. 
  f*ck. 
  "What did he say? 
 " Jesus Christ, Danny. 
  I don't give a f*ck what he said. 
  f*cking Marisol.

  Okay. 
  She didn't f*cking lay in you, m*therf*cker.

  (KNOCK ON DOOR) 
  Hang on a sec. 
  I tried the bar first. 
  Look, McBride, I'm here out of respect. 
  I'd like to put a plea offer on the table. 
  The kid was at the crime scene, but he didn't kill anybody. 
  - He told you that? 
  - Yeah, and I believe him. 
  Yeah, I know you do, because you want to believe it. 
  I hope you don't have some big speech planned. 
  We don't have an audience here. 
  I'm offering voluntary manslaughter. 
  11 years. 
  Uh, good behavior, he'll be out in maybe seven. 
  By that time, he's only 23 years old. 
  - That's enough - You know what happens to a kid when they put him in jail for seven years. 
  It's a fair offer. 
  You're gonna do him more harm than good if you don't take it. 
  He didn't do it. 
  The offer is on the table. 
  You have an obligation to take that offer to your client. 
  I don't want this case being overturned for ineffective assistance of counsel. 
  No chance. 
  Good. 
  $50 million? 
  Okay. 
  You know, I don't get to keep it all. 
  You know how that works. 
  Yeah, I can tell. 
  That's for you. 
  A gift from Miss Silva. 
  (PLAYING SOMBER CLASSICAL MUSIC) 
  (MUSIC CONTINUES) 
  WYATT: Oh, I remember you had the salmon ravioli, and I had the lamb chop, and I very clearly remember telling you to distance yourself - from Julio Suarez. 
  - He is innocent. 
  Kids like Julio are the cornerstone of my campaign. 
  Okay, this-this is not about the f*cking election! 
  Whoa, whoa, whoa. 
  Danny, Danny, Danny, Danny. 
  Th-Then just tell me what's going on. 
  The floor is yours. 
  When you tipped us off about the DEA raids, we had to do some housecleaning. 
  That's your f*cking business. 
  I did you a favor. 
  I probably shouldn't have. 
  But I'm not involved in whatever mess this is. 
  Okay, here's-here's how you're involved. 
  Hunter what's-his-name, the white kid? 
  He was one of ours. 
  Okay? 
  This is where it gets real f*cking real. 
  We needed to get rid of him. 
  Y-You had him killed? 
  All I did was pass along a tip so you can clean up whatever mess you needed to clean up, not f*cking kill people. 
  Well, regardless, Julio Suarez getting picked up for it is good for us. 
  There it is, crystal f*cking clear. 
  No, I I never meant Well, intention or not, it's what happened, and we need to f*cking deal with it. 
  I mean, Jesus, you're the one that introduced Tom to La Mano. 
  Through a friend of a friend. 
  I-I don't know the guy at all. 
  And I never would've been involved in anything like this. 
  Can I say something, please? 
  Okay? 
  Excuse me. 
  This is just bad luck. 
  Okay? 
  This is a kid you know who was in the wrong situation at the wrong - He's not just a kid, Tom. 
  - No, no, no, we get it. 
  - We get it. 
  - He won't stop. 
  He's perfect. 
  He's a good kid. 
  He's innocent. 
  We've seen you on the f*cking news night after night, saying just that! 
  And we're not the only ones watching. 
  What does he mean? 
  - Gabriel? 
  - WYATT: Mm-hmm. 
  All I did was arrange for you to meet. 
  Okay? 
  All I did was arrange for you to meet. 
  - So, you spoke to him? 
  - WYATT: I did. 
  I did. 
  Um, I had a-a gun in my back with my balls hanging out in a towel in the back of a black f*cking Escalade. 
  - And the I think the henchman - (SIGHS) 
  had a hook hand, and he told me he was gonna cut my f*cking dick off! 
  - (SIGHS) 
  Julio's my fault. 
  - LOOMIS: Yeah. 
  - Yeah, I'd say Julio's your - Come on, don't be, don't be - No, I-I would. 
  - Don't - Yeah. 
  - Let's be helpful. 
  Let's be helpful. 
  Okay? 
  We're here to help you. 
  We're here to help us. 
  We're a team. 
  Right? 
  I'm sorry. 
  This is not your fault. 
  Danny's sorry. 
  Okay? 
  He knows this is a shitty situation. 
  But th-there's a bottom line here. 
  If Julio goes to jail, we are in the clear. 
  Julio goes free, we all go down. 
  I know you. 
  And you are stronger than you think you are. 
  - You got this. 
  - (PATTING HAND) 
  - Good night, Miss Elena. 
  - Good night. 
  - What happened to your face? 
  - Uh, basketball. 
  No. 
  Is everything okay? 
  Yes, all is good. 
  Great. 
  Uh, one quick thing. 
  Uh-huh. 
  - Tomorrow - Yeah. 
  during the teacher's union meeting, it might be nice if you don't only take photos with the billionaire boys club. 
  Maybe take some shots with the people in the community. 
  We don't want them forgetting where you're from. 
  You don't have any idea where I'm from. 
  - Um, I apologize. 
  - Just Can you please close the door? 
  Thank you. 
  Sure.
