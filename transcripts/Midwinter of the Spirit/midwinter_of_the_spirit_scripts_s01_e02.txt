 I want a new kind of Deliverance: someone with experience in modern life. 
 You don't mind, do you? 
 No, of course not, sweetheart. 
 He was your dad. Canon Dobbs? 
 Canon Dobbs, it's Merrily. I really need your help. 
 Denzil Joy is a powerful man. 
 Scritch-scratch! Powerfully evil. 
 They told us you had some sort of training in occult matters. 
 Leave this thing alone, I beg of you, for your own good. 
 Mum, you are so naive. You're walking into this. 
 If you're weak, they'll get in, lass. 
 I thought, with the strength of St Thomas Cantilupe, I could stand up to this evil, but I can't. 
 Not even He can help us. 
 Not against them. 
 They've shown... 
 They no longer hide their deeds. 
 They want to rub our noses in their blasphemy. 
 God help us. 
 God help you, Merrily. 
 I feel terrible I didn't hear that until I played it back, this morning. 
 It's hard to hear him so... irrational. 
 Well, he wasn't irrational when I spoke to him, just shit-scared. 
 He knew that Paul Sayer was mixed up in something. 
 He mentioned Paul Sayer and a man called Denzil Joy. 
 Denzil Joy? Do you know him? 
 Coming across Denzil Joy would be enough to drive anyone to take their own life. 
 He didn't take his own life. 
 Can't we safely say that... if he was losing his mind that - 
 He wasn't losing his mind. 
 He knew something. So you're saying he was murdered? 
 Yes. Yes, I am, yes. I'm saying that he was murdered by the same person who crucified Paul Sayer. 
 Murder, suicide... 
 Let's just wait for the outcome of Dobbs' post-mortem, eh? 
 Oh, bloody hell! Ooh, I hope you don't mind, lass. 
 It's right brass monkeys in here. 
 Still, it's nice when folk leave their front doors unlocked. 
 Huw, what part of, 'Can you get back to me please, now, please?' do you not understand? 
 Well, I'm a busy man. 
 You know, there's a haunting in Swansea with all the bells and whistles. 
 A right to-do, it is. I need you here. 
 Things are kicking off here. I can't cope on my own. 
 Not ready to chuck in the towel, lass, are we? 
 Not up to this Deliverance lark? 
 You bloody b*st*rd. 
 You deliberately didn't get back to me. 
 Sometimes, when you learn to ride a bike, you need to take the stabilisers off. 
 Knobhead! 
 Oh, Merrily, it was a... you had a message. 
 A Reverend Jeffrey Kimball. 
 Quite agitated. 
 A problem at St Mary's Church in Stretford. 
 What kind of problem? 
 Desecration. 
 This better be good. Hiya. 
 Not exactly twiddling our thumbs at the moment. 
 Yeah, well, as I said on the phone, I really think it might be relevant. 
 Looks bloody awful, but we'll sort it all out. 
 What are you going to do? 
 I've got a wedding on Saturday, a christening Sunday. 
 I can't cancel. I can't tell them that my church has been defiled. 
 This lovely place of worship has stood here for nigh-on 1,000 years. 
 Its light isn't going to go out in a hurry, not if we have anything to do with it. 
 All right, you just... 
 This is Huw Owen, this is the gentleman I told you about and he's been brought up to speed with everything. 
 I'm sorry I haven't tidied up. 
 I-I couldn't touch it, it was just... 
 Could it be kids? No, this isn't kids. 
 These people know what they're doing. 
 They do it for a kind of intoxication. 
 You know, it's almost... sexual. 
 You bet your life they don't leave here feeling disgusted and nauseous, that's for sure. 
 You really think these are the same people who crucified Paul Sayer and murdered Alan Dobbs? 
 Yes. Yeah, I do. I do think that, yeah. 
 What we should be asking ourselves is why here? 
 Right... Why now? 
 Playing games with us, presumably. 
 You came to me for my expertise. Huw knows what he's talking about. 
 Will you please listen to him? I know this looks li... 
 A crow sacrifice is deep. It is deep in symbolic meaning. Yeah. 
 They debased a sacred Christian site going back centuries. 
 OK. 
 Let's organise a fingertip search. 
 See if these Satanists drop their litter. 
 OK, boss. I'll organise that ASAP. 
 Well, what I propose, Merrily, is a ceremony of lesser exorcism. 
 Great! When? 
 The sooner the better, I mean, the vicar wants his church back. 
 I don't like the idea of it sitting here, openly violated. 
 What do you think? 
 Hm? Me? 
 Well, you're the one that's going to be doing it. 
 Er... Oh. 
 So, did you shag him, then? No. 
 We just talked, about him being chosen as Boy Bishop. 
 That must be a turn-on! 
 Hi. 
 Hi, you two. 
 How are you? Yeah, I'm great, actually. Good. 
 Thank you, for the other day, I mean. 
 It's been months since dad died and I've never talked to anybody like I talked to you. 
 It's churned you up and you can't think about anything else, can you? 
 Don't worry, it'll pass. 
 If you act on what you discover, make the right changes - 
 In other words, get a life. 
 Could we talk again, do you think? 
 Of course, any time. 
 You know where I am now. 
 Anyway, lovely to see you. 
 It'll get you out the dreary old vicarage on the long, winter nights. Do you think I should tell my mum first? 
 Why? What she won't know won't kill her. 
 Need a bit of quiet? 
 No, let's just get on with it. 
 Right. Right, start with the door. 
 Go right the way around it, 360. 
 Every corner. 
 Just follow the instructions, like we went through before, all right. 
 Use the water. 
 Don't faff. 
 I'll be here if you want me. 
 Want to pray together first? 
 Oh, I'd rather have a fag. 
 All right. 
 I'll keep it simple. 
 Lord, be with us in this tainted place tonight. 
 Help this lass Merrily, your good and loving servant, repossess it... in Your holy name and the glory of God from whatever dark hangs around it. 
 Just... What is it? 
 What is it? 
 You... No... Get off! 
 Ow! 
 Get out of here! 
 Get out now! 
 Our Father, who art in Heaven, hallowed be Thy name. 
 Thy kingdom come... 
 I don't know why you bother putting pictures up. 
 The place is a complete pigsty. You've get to start pulling your weight, Jane. 
 I knew you wouldn't like it. I don't care either way, to be honest. 
 You're not going to make me forget him, Mum. All right. 
 It's all I've got left of him. 
 Jane? 
 It's all right, Mum. Everything's gonna be all right from now on. 
 Hey. Oh, bloody hell. 
 Are you stalking me? 
 No. 
 No. When, I stalk people, I tend to do it really, really badly. 
 No, I was just visiting a client, actually. 
 Are you all right? 
 I'm sorry about last time. 
 Er, I was a bit overly-defensive about my daughter. 
 Supposed to be a fresh start. That's a joke. 
 What have I got instead? 
 A huge photo of my dead husband grinning at me from daughter's bedroom wall. 
 And that's bad... why? 
 Because coming here was supposed to help her get over it. 
 That was the whole point. 
 You could tell her how you feel. 
 How can I be truthful with her about everything that's going on in my life? 
 'Sweetheart, I'm just popping out to deal with a tribe of Satanists. 
 There's a ready-meal in the fridge. 
 Oh, and there's a crow that's just been sacrificed on the altar in Stretford, so...' 
 Sorry, have I said something..? 
 No. 
 Nothing. 
 What, you think someone put it there? Well, somebody did. 
 A dead crow on your doorstep... 
 It never occurred to you that might be, I don't know, some kind of a threat? 
 Or a warning, you know? That you might be in some kind of danger? 
 Sorry, but you seem totally unfazed by this. 
 You don't, you seem very fazed. 
 I always thought they were birds of ill-omen. 
 Or good omen. 
 When I was little, I used to stand in our farmyard and wish that the crows would come down from the sky and play with me and they did. 
 It was amazing. They'd gather at my feet. 
 I remember it so clearly. 
 Do you want a vodka in that? 
 Joke. 
 I like that you worry about me. 
 Rowenna, it's my job to worry about you. 
 Hiya. 
 Right. 
 What happened last night, Lass, at that church? 
 I think I've had a bug, or something. 
 I think that was the problem. 
 No. 
 I could see your face. 
 That is not the problem. That is pretty bloody far from the problem and you are bloody far from OK. 
 Huw, I'm fine. I've just said to you, I had a... a dickie tummy, I'd had it all day. I've got to go. 
 Bishop Mick's gonna say a few words about Dobbs at the morning service - 
 Forget about Bishop Mick, forget Dobbs, you need... 
 Hell! 
 How did you get that? 
 Have you had that seen to? It could be infected. 
 Look, Huw, I can look after myself, OK? 
 If anything, it was the fact that you were there, with all your doubts and misgivings undermining me. 
 Now, listen, I prayed with you last night, Lass, and that hand - it was red hot, I could feel it. 
 It was below zero last night and you were burning up. 
 Mick, I've got to go. What stopped you... from praying with me, Merrily? 
 Oh, Merrily! 
 Canon Dobbs gave his life to this cathedral. 
 True, selfless dedication for the love of Christ, our saviour. 
 And, whatever the manner of his tragic passing... which has shocked us all, I will not tolerate the whispers I have heard... of Christian disapproval. 
 Rosemary, I can't seem to access Rowenna's case notes - from before she came to Hereford. 
 If they're old notes, they might not be migrated onto the system. 
 I'm just sure they were there before. 
 Don't worry about it. 
 See her safe and settled and get her off our caseload. 
 Good words. Thank you. 
 It's so dreadful to have it confirmed by the post-mortem. 
 Sorry, what? 
 Suicide. 
 DCI Howe called me. I thought you knew. 
 No. 
 No, I didn't. 
 Excuse me? 
 My name's Merrily Watkins. 
 Did you know Canon Dobbs well? 
 Oh, yes, I was his cleaner for 40 years. Oh, right. 
 Oh, he was a lovely man. 
 Till... Till he changed, you know, telling me to get out and shouting. 
 And do you believe he'd erm... become unbalanced? 
 Well, he had his head stuck in that book all hours of the day. 
 What book was that? The one about the old Bishop of Hereford, you know, from the Middle Ages. 
 What... St Thomas Cantilupe? That's it. 
 Read it from cover to cover over and over, he did. 
 Well, why? What was his fascination with Thomas Cantilupe? God knows. 
 God knows what was going on in that house. 
 What do you mean? 
 Well, he'd sit watching the television with these voices. 
 I don't know what they were. 
 Chanting. 
 And when was that? 
 Well, just after a man came round and gave him something. 
 A man? What did the man look like? 
 Well, he had long hair, beard... 
 After that, he knew something. 
 He knew something that he didn't like. 
 Something that made him ill. 
 So ill that he... 
 Oh, the sad thing is that's what he'll be remembered as. 
 A mad old vicar. 
 That won't happen. I'll make sure that doesn't happen. 
 Oh, look at me! These are his keys. 
 I should return them to the Bishop's Palace but, what with everything, I... 
 Don't you worry about that. 
 I'll take care of them. That is good of you. Yeah. 
 That date line indicates this was shot 12 years ago. 
 I'd say his cellar hasn't changed a bit. 
 A little girl of what, six? Seven? 
 How did this come to be in Dobbs' possession? 
 His cleaner, er, she said that a man visited Dobbs. 
 The description, it fitted Paul Sayer. 
 Maybe... Paul Sayer visited Dobbs because he wanted to get out of this thing. 
 Maybe he wanted... to confess. 
 It cost him his life. 
 Strung up as a warning to others. Keep him in line. 
 Stop it there! 
 That is Denzil Joy, I know from that scar! 
 I could check his medical records. 
 All right, we could have evidence that Paul Sayer knew Denzil Joy, but we know that Denzil was in hospital when Sayer was strung up. 
 There's a dozen people in that video. 
 Any one of them could've done that - more than one, most likely. 
 Please, please, you can't deny the connection now. 
 What about Dobbs? 
 OK. 
 I'll speak to the coroner about Dobbs. 
 I want a new post-mortem. Thank you. 
 Leave that. 
 There. That includes your share of the tips. 
 Customers liked you. I knew they would. 
 How did you enjoy your first night? 
 It was fun. 
 I'm glad. Maybe you didn't think about your mum for five minutes. 
 
 
 
 Hiya. 
 I can clock off soon. Are we doing anything? 
 I mean, the three of us? Nah, I've got a sermon to write, remember. 
 Oh, we're in the presence of the Boy Bishop. 
 Not yet, you're not. 
 Yet? I still don't get it. 
 I told you, once a year, a lucky chorister gets to play Bishop. 
 I get to wear the mitre and hold a staff and everything. 
 Oh, that explains why you practise holding your staff every night! 
 Can I go now please, Angela? 
 I forgot to ask. I'm having a party at my house tomorrow night and I need someone to hand out drinks and nibbles. 
 Would you two be up for that? 
 25 quid in it for you each? 
 Done. 
 Am I speaking to Mrs Napier? Carol Napier? 
 Yes. 
 Mrs Napier, hi. I'm Rowenna's social worker. 
 I told you, Mr Ambrose - 
 Ambrose? N-No, my name's Lol Robinson, in Hereford. 
 Hello? What do you want? 
 Yeah, it-it's just that there's a few holes in Rowenna's past and I thought, being the adoptive parents, you might be able to - 
 Steer clear of her, all right? 
 That's all you need to know. 
 Steer clear of her, like we had to. 
 Mrs... 
 Oh, go away! 
 It was you what sent the police round here. 
 They had me down the station. Mrs Joy - They were all over my home. 
 Mrs Joy - Ah, you pathetic woman! 
 Mrs Joy, I saw a little girl, recorded on video, pawed and manipulated, made to partake in things I cannot unsee. 
 I cannot bleach from my mind, Mrs Joy. 
 You need to speak about this, for your soul, if for nothing else. 
 Men like that, you think you be rid of 'em, but you'll never be. 
 And the other people, did you know them? 
 They were Denzil's secret life. 
 His hobby. 
 I was never a part of that... that sickness. 
 And God help me! Soon as I knew, I got her away. 
 Who? The girl? Mm. 
 I put my own daughter into care to get her away from him. 
 His own daughter? 
 He never knew. 
 If you were a mother... you'll understand... that you'll do anything, anything to protect your child. 
 Mr Ambrose, please, you were supervising her before she became my responsibility. 
 Just getting this address was like getting blood from a stone. Please! 
 Do you remember Hilary Pile? 
 Who's she? He. 
 He was a canon, Salisbury Cathedral. 
 Married with kids. 
 Not the sort of person you'd have thought would get caught having s*x with a schoolgirl. 
 Rowenna. She was 15. 
 He was 45. 
 Terrified of his name coming out. 
 Terrified of the consequences. 
 Killed himself. 
 Exeter to London train. 
 The church managed to hush up the sexual affair part, but he left a note. 
 Said exactly what you'd expect a sex-mad clergyman might say to expunge his guilty conscience. 
 Said Rowenna was, 'Sent by the Devil.' 
 Oh, my god. 
 Great. Welcome. 
 This wasn't much then, it was just a scratch. 
 Well, it only takes a scratch. I bloody told you, didn't I? 
 Just hold it there. 
 Denzil Joy had something to do with Paul Sayer's murder. 
 I know he abused his own daughter. 
 Now he's in my life, I can't get rid of him. 
 You've got to tell me how to get rid of him. 
 Right, happen he's a carrier. 
 A carrier's a nasty piece of work who uses that nastiness as an engine, usually with an overly-powerful s*x drive. 
 Yeah, there was. 
 I could erm... 
 I could feel... his touch... 
 It was... 
 It was inside me. 
 Mm. Oh, yeah, you told me the nurse had said much the same. 
 Hey... 
 Sitting there, holding his hand whilst he slipped away, what did you feel? 
 Oh, I don't know. Er, sick. 
 No, I didn't feel sick, I felt... angry. Angry? 
 I hadn't really been that close to death since my husband died and those feelings, that... 
 ..that I could be so stupid to love someone who would... 
 Go on. Tell me. 
 I don't know, it was all mixed up in my head with the feeling when... er, Sean touched me. 
 And the erm, lie of that tenderness, after he'd been with that girl. 
 The... 
 The betrayal of it. 
 How did Sean die? It was a car crash. 
 She was... She was... 
 She was next to him. That's how I found out. 
 I just... 
 See, it was just the feeling of it was my fault. 
 He used to call me a pious bitch. 
 Maybe, if I hadn't been so pious, then he wouldn't have had to find a young secretary to screw. 
 Well, there you have it. 
 That's why you were such a magnet for Denzil's residual energy. 
 Oh... 
 What, because... I'm a little bit upset about my husband having an affair? 
 It all lays you wide open - I've told you. 
 Rage and resentment - Why am I listening to this? 
 Because you need to listen to this. 
 No. No, no, right from day one, you have told me that I am not worthy to be a Deliverance Minister. 
 Well, you're not. Don't this prove it? 
 Do you know what? You are right. You are right. 
 I should leave this to the police. 
 I should go back to being a vicar and a mum. 
 I should have the courage to tell Bishop Mick where to shove his job. 
 Congratulations. You got your own way. 
 That is the best decision you have ever made for me. 
 Thank you. 
 Sweetheart, I just got your message. 
 Can you just give me a call and let me know where... where you are? 
 Thanks. As soon as you can. Thanks. 
 Oh, you scared me. 
 I did knock, the door was open. 
 Oh, I didn't expect you to come at all. 
 Tomorrow would've been fine. It sounded urgent. 
 Oh! Thank you. 
 Great. I'm gonna drink all of that. 
 Here you are. 
 S-Sorry, I was just... 
 Is this what you believe in? 
 I don't believe in one book. 
 Why should we, when there are whole libraries at our fingertips? 
 It never made sense to my dad, either. 
 He always used to say, 'The Christian church is just another empire, wanting to spread its tendrils.' 
 Did he give you that necklace? 
 For my last birthday. 
 It's beautiful. 
 Can I see it? 
 I've let you down, I know I have. I'm really sorry. 
 I just... I thought that coming here would bring Jane and I closer and actually, we're just further apart. 
 Look, it won't always be like this. 
 I've got faith in you. 
 I just wish you had as much faith in yourself. 
 You're an extraordinary woman, Merrily. 
 Can I have that in writing, please? 
 I speak my mind. Does get me in trouble, sometimes. 
 Look, just don't give up. 
 You're tired. Nobody makes good decisions when they're tired. 
 It's what drove him away, isn't it? 
 From your mother, not from you. 
 Never from you. She changed. 
 She found God. 
 He tried. 
 He tried so hard, but... her faith wouldn't meet him halfway. 
 Ruined his marriage, his family... and even now, he knows it's the problem at the centre of your life. 
 He can see it and he can't ignore it. 
 He wants you to reject these constraints imposed upon you. 
 The belief that replaced love, it cost him his life. 
 I'm sorry, I don't... I don't feel... 
 It's all right, Jane. 
 It's all right. Relax. 
 Just relax. 
 Close your eyes and just think about him. 
 Whatever way he comes to you, just let him. 
 You love him. 
 I know you love him... and love doesn't end with death. 
 He's your flesh and blood. 
 Your spirit is his spirit... and that bond can't be broken. 
 Good night, Merrily. Night. 
 Can we talk, please? 
 This is Lol. 
 Hello. 
 Rowenna's told me all about you. She was extremely flattering. 
 Ange is a friend of ours. Yeah. 
 I work for her part-time at a bistro in Church Street. 
 Does you Mum know about that? Yes. 
 Dear me. 
 You seem very anxious, Lol. I don't know why. 
 I have popped round to thank them for doing me a little favour. 
 It's good for youngsters to start the day with a decent breakfast. 
 Yeah and to get a good night's sleep. 
 Jane looks hung over or... worse. 
 What have you come here for, anyway? 
 I can wait. 
 You think I can't see what's going on here. 
 Well, Rowenna has people who care about her now so, why don't you follow your dick elsewhere? 
 Last night, she stayed over at Rowenna's. 
 You know she's been working at this bistro part-time in Church Street. 
 How could someone... No, sorry. No, I didn't know. What? 
 She's working for someone called Angela. 
 I don't know what's going on, but there's something not right about that woman. 
 I don't trust her. 
 Jane is 16. 
 Who is this woman? It's not just that. 
 Rowenna has... some emotional issues that go very, very deep. 
 All right, obviously, I can't tell you many more details, but... the more I find out, the more it worries me. 
 Worries you? 
 Come on! 
 Come on. 
 Come round. 
 Just come back to mine. 
 My parents are gone all night. My mum would murder me. 
 What, you... 
 You don't want to? No, I do. 
 Of course I do. Just... 
 Just not yet. 
 That's fine. Yeah? 
 Yeah, it's totally cool. 
 OK. 
 Bye. 
 She's got it real bad for you. 
 Yeah. 
 I thought that was the idea. 
 Merrily, it's Huw. Don't ignore this call. 
 You really need to call me back, now. 
 Where were you, last night? Oh, Jesus! 
 Am I allowed to say 'Jesus'? You don't have to say what I tell you to say. 
 Oi! Come back here. I want to talk to you. 
 I'm seeing a lad who's gonna be Boy Bishop. 
 I thought that would please you, but... no. 
 I want some answers, please. Answers to what? 
 Life? I thought you had all of those. 
 I was with people I want to be with, all right? 
 Rowenna? No, not all right. I don't want you hanging out with her. 
 Who's this Angela you're working for, anyway? 
 Oh! So now I'm being spied on? 
 What, my every f*cking move is being monitored? 
 I just want to know where you are and who you're hanging out with. 
 Is that too much to ask? 
 She's a good person. 
 A nice person. One who's been helping me. 
 Helping you with what? Coming to terms with my pressures. 
 What pressures? If you must know, she let's me talk about Dad, which is more than you ever do. 
 Now I've got to listen to you hero-worship your dad. 
 I've got news for you, he was a complete sh1t! 
 Oh, listen to yourself! You don't see that's the exact problem! 
 You can't get over the fact you hate his guts for what he did to you. 
 Who's the child here? 
 For Christ's sake, get over it! 
 At least it explains why Rowenna returned to Hereford, to be with her biological father. 
 Wait, is that what she told you? 
 Yeah. 
 Well, that's strange, cos he was the reason she left. 
 The fella had a record for molestation, aggravated sexual assault, all sorts. 
 Perfect name for it too, I remember: Joy! 
 Denzil Joy. 
 Jane! Jane! Come down here! 
 Do you know what? I do hate him. 
 He treated me like crap. I hate every fibre and microbe of... 
 What are you doing with that bag? 
 Well, he wants me to have a life, even if you don't. You what? Angela gave me a message from him. 
 I know it's true. Truer than any bullshit you believe in. 
 You've got no idea who you're mixed up with. 
 Jane, listen to me. You don't know who these people are, spinning these lies! 
 They're better than your lies. My lies are what you're stuck with. I don't have to be. 
 You're not going anywhere! You're f*cking joking! I am never coming back here! 
 Jane... 
 Jane! Hey! 
 Just drive, please. Jane! Can you just drive? 
 Please! Please. Please. Please. Please. Please. Please. Please.
