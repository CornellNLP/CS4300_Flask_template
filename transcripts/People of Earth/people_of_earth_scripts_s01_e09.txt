 Gerry : I'm gonna be, like, the ambassador of the human race. 
 Got my date wrong. 
 I need some space, but let's still be friends. 
 I need you all to leave. 
 He's kicking us out. 
 I still want to hire you for this position. 
 I'm going back to New York. 
 You can't run from this forever, Ozzie. 
 Empathy. 
 Gina is Empathy. 
 ♪ ♪ 
 What are you doing? 
 Shut up. I'm on a date. 
 You've met someone? 
 That's great! 
 That's not... No. It's for the mission. 
 Of course. 
 Richard : You know, Nancy, you... really know how to show a guy a good time. 
 And, uh... thanks for paying for dinner. 
 My pleasure. 
 I'm definitely gonna check out Ayn Rand's stuff. 
 She sounds so interesting. 
 Ayn. It's pronounced... 
 ... Ayn. 
 You should get people's names right. 
 [Chuckles] 
 Well, uh... 
 "Ayn" having a very good time tonight. 
 So, what else can you tell me about Gina? 
 I think I pretty much covered everything. 
 You know, her likes, her dislikes, how we met, where she lives. 
 And there's nothing else... 
 ... I should know? 
 Okay. Yeah. 
 I think I know what's going on here. You do? Listen. There is nothing going on between me and Gina. I mean, yes, I've always thought she had a crush on me, but... she is not my type. You are. What do I do? Kiss him! Ugh. Ugh! Ugh. [Sighs] Look, I really... I'm tempted to invite you in right now, but I'm... I'm still transitioning from divorced guy to single guy, so... Very well. Good night. I'll see you at StarCrossed tomorrow. I look forward to it. ♪ ♪ [Sighs] She's the one. I've gathered useful intel on Empathy from this asset. Empathy? You mean, uh... The woman who killed Kurt. Sweet Kurt. I'm gonna use his knowledge to make her death as painful as possible. That doesn't sound like it's on-mission. I'll humiliate Empathy, and then I'll put an end to her. It'll be clean. Efficient. Maybe we should just talk about this before you do anything. I'm done talking. Now is the time for action. [Sighs] Mom, you didn't have to do all this. Well, I'm just so glad to have you back in town. You've got a new job at  The New York Times. Safe. Stable. Prestigious. Next thing you know, you'll meet someone. Maybe like that nice girl you dated who was with the circus. She wasn't in the circus, Mom. She was a yoga teacher who had a nose ring. Hey, Mom, do you know where my Social Security card and birth certificate are? You're a grown man. You should know where your documents are. I do. I have copies. I just... I leave the originals here. I leave everything that's important here, so it's safe. I gave all that stuff to your father. He has more storage space at his place. What? No... Ozzie, relax. He's not that bad. That's easy for you to say. You got to divorce him. [Scoffs] I did not expect to have to have an awkward time at Uncle Daddy's house today. [Knocking] Doug? Hey. Chelsea. What can I do for you? I wanted to see how you were doing. I'm fine, thank you. Are you, um... are you going somewhere? Yes. I'm taking a vacation. After all the stuff that happened, I just, um... need a little time to think. Because of the kidnapping? Yes. And other stuff. Where are you going? The Bronze Star Inn. In Schenectady. By the outlet mall? I was in a band a long time ago. Operation Mongoose. [Chuckling] No way. Oh, my gosh. Look at you! Yeah. Guess who's getting the band back together again. Wow. It's happening. Pretend you just ordered some nice, steamy pizza. The delivery guy's on his way up the walk, then bam! Gets bit by a dog. We don't have a dog. It doesn't matter. It was on your property. Does home insurance cover it? No. Life insurance? Nope. Umbrella insurance covers everything. Maybe we should get it. Maybe you should. It's like putting bubble wrap around all your worries. Plus you get one of these bad boys. Where do we sign? Gina : It's been an eventful couple of weeks. Let's... let's just do the... Kelly, what are you doing? I'm... I'm lounging. It's... it's a lounge. Right. Can you do that without your shoes on, please? Can we not meet in a store? Sorry we're late. We were carpooling. Is that what the kids call it? Okay, great. Hi guys. Um, come on in. Uh, let's see. Guys, we really do have to be out of the store by 9:45. Is everyone really clear on the concept of a hard out? 'Cause I can't... Yes. We are clear on that. Let's begin. Richard : No. No, actually, we can't begin, because... Nancy still doesn't have all of her introduction materials, so... Oh. Um, right, okay. Um... Here's your binder. Pick a sponsor. Don't make a whole thing out of it. I've got all the time in the world... murderer. I'll be your sponsor, Nancy. Don : There you go. Don? Yeah. H-hi, Jonathan. What is happening right now? Why are you working in a coffee shop? It's related to the mission. It's the truth. It's not. It's not. I'm lying. Uh, can we talk by the milk station? [Light rock music plays] Oh, wow, that's a lovely scarf. No, don't change the subject. Does Jeff know you work here? Uh, technically, no... no. But don't... please don't tell him. Who am I gonna tell? I went rogue. Yeah. I didn't want to bring it up, but I heard through the grapevine. Sorry about that. No. Not at all. I'm enjoying my new-found freedom. I'm out there in the world, you know? But hey, listen, I'm a little strapped for cash. Could you get me an iced mocha macchiato on the house? Of course. Cool. And maybe, uh... could you give me your tips? Okay, so, how... how was your week, Richard? Well, there was this one incident. Hey, Richard. There's a long-distance call for you on line two. Who is it? I don't know. I couldn't understand it. They were speaking Klingon. [Laughs] Like a Klingon would use a landline. Uh-huh. Uh-huh. So how'd that make you feel? Okay, I can't process things when you're rushing along my healing. Well, to be clear, I'm rushing through everyone's healing. Okay, Kelly, your turn to share. Um, I feel like your energy's a little too, like, overwhelmed-grad-student right now. Is there a way that we could do this another time and place that's not so rushed? I'm working on it. Nothing has come through yet. Sorry. Nancy, I'm sorry. Things aren't normally this chaotic. Ennis : My offer still stands. We could meet up tonight at my barn. It would have to be, like, you know, 7:30. I still got to feed the cows. Sure, let's meet up there. Sounds murder-y. I like it. The store opens in five minutes. Can you do me a favor and just pick up your trash? And if you'd please put the pillows around and distribute them, I'd be really grateful. Check the alarm. I'm not going out the back Go out the back. Check the alarm, guys. 
 
 Ronald :  Nam myoho renge kyo. Nam myoho renge kyo. [knocking] Ozzie : Dad, are you home? Ronald :  Nam myoho renge kyo. Nam myoho renge kyo. Ozzie : Dad? Nam myoho... Hey, Dad? ... renge kyo. Nam myoho... You can join me if you want. No. I'm good. [Gong clangs] Ozzie! My man! Okay. All right. [Laughs] Yeah, it's good to see you too, Dad. So, when did you become a Buddhist? Oh, about four months ago. Got into it for this chick. She left, but it stayed. Oh. Well, all right. Did Mom call you and tell you I need to pick up some documents? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, I keep all that stuff cataloged in my office. [Funky hip-hop music plays] [Creepy calliope music plays] Dad, what's this? Hmm? Was I in Beacon as a kid? I can't answer that. What do you mean, you can't answer it? It's a yes or no question. That I can't answer. Your mother made me promise. I'm sorry. All right. I'll just ask her myself. No. Put that away. We're gonna have to have a family meeting. Family meeting? We never have those. What's going on? ♪ ♪ [Applause] Doug : Welcome to the Coconut Lounge, where the drinks are cold and the jazz is hot. Uh, this next number is one of our first songs we ever wrote together. It's called "Serengeti Rhapsody." Uno. Dos. Uno. Dos. Tres. ♪ ♪ [Sneezes] Bless you, bless you. [Coughs] I-I met someone. He's, um, from Iceland. He's really sweet, and we're taking it slow. Good for you. Good, good, good. Sounds like progress. He's cool. He's, like, um... he's not  really  cool, but I don't really care. Which... I guess is maturity. Oh, yes, Nancy. Do you have something that you'd like to share with Kelly? No. I would like to schedule a one-on-one appointment with you, Gina. Just you and me. Alone. I'm shy. Gina : We don't really do that here at StarCrossed. The point of group therapy is to connect with people who share a common experience. You're new. I made the same mistake. But you're doing great. Everybody loves you. Man, so desperate for love. You lost me?! You  wandered off. Oh, that's good. Blame the nine-year-old. Can you let us explain? Believe me, we know. It was not our proudest parenting moment. Fine, just tell me what happened. Okay. Yes, we went to Beacon. There was a heat wave that summer. And we thought we'd go to the lake, but your father got lost. We almost hit a deer at one point. Wait, you almost hit a deer? So now we're all hungry and lost, so we go to a grocery store for some snacks. Next thing I know, we're yelling at each other. I can't even remember what we were fighting about. Anything and everything. We could see that you were upset, so we got you a grape soda and we sat you on the horsey ride. And, after a few minutes, we looked up, and you were gone. Judy : Ozzie! We ran ourselves crazy looking for you. We... we searched all over town. I've never been more scared than I was that day. The worst 48 hours of my life. We thought we'd lost you for good. And then, out of nowhere, we got a call. One of the stock boys had found you asleep behind the big bags of dog food. I blamed him for losing you. He blamed me. And the guilt tore us apart. Soon after that, we got a divorce. Oh, wow. We thought you'd be more upset. You're not mad at us for losing you? Oh, no, I'm-I'm furious at you, but this explains everything... all the déjà vu that I've been having in Beacon... it was just that I was suppressing the memories of this divorce. Beacon was the place where my family fell apart. That's why Beacon triggered... all the anxiety and my breakdown. It wasn't aliens. Aliens? Yeah, uh, here's the thing. I wasn't in Beacon writing a Civil War novel. I was in therapy because I thought I'd been abducted by aliens. Abducted by aliens? Therapy? Good news. I wasn't. All right? All of the trauma that I was going through was just because you all were horrible parents, which, no offense, but this is a relief... if you see it from my side. So, like, what, you were seeing, uh, little green guys or something? Like, a tall lizard guy, and then there was, like, a Nordic, like, white one with long hair. It's-it's beside the point. I had my quit my job, and I was in this support group. I was living in a shitty motel. [laughs] I had a piece of metal taken out of my head, which I need to talk to you guys about that at some point... but I had really spiraled. Ozzie, why didn't you tell us? You kept a secret from me for 30 years. I kept one for two months. So I think... it's a little kettle-calling-the-pot-kettle. Gina : So, Nancy, last time, you mentioned you lost a friend. I believe his name was Kirk. Kurt, actually. Y-yeah, is he your boyfriend? 'Cause you never actually mentioned... He was my co-worker. Mm, but you were close. Yes, we were very close. Did you feel that you and Kurt... were more than just coworkers? Yes, I suppose we were. We had a... ... Special bond. Did you love Kurt? Is she taunting me? Does she want to luxuriate in the details of the murder she committed? I won't give her the pleasure. I came here to join this group for support. I did not come here to be interrogated in a barn by some quack. No! Nancy! Use that! Your anger is good! Own it! Own it! Or take it out on me if you need to. I know what this is. She's super jealous. She thinks you're in love with me. Why would she think that? I don't know. Well, um... I know we're a bunch of old guys up there, and we're a little rusty. You have a number-one fan here. Okay. Well, thank you. Yeah. I had no idea there was this side to you. It's something that doesn't come up in my day job, right? So... No, I had fun. Well, thank you. Okay, um, well, it is getting late tonight. I should probably head back. Yes, and I... you know, they're loading up, so I just need to help the fellows load up. Yeah. Sure. So... see you around. Uh, yeah. Sure. Okay. Okay. Yeah. [Giggles] Take it easy. You too. Good night. Bye. Keyboards. Judy : Ozzie? I thought maybe you'd like to see this. What's this? I couldn't stop thinking about that day in Beacon, and when you mentioned the alien therapy thing, I remembered you started drawing these right after you got lost. I drew this? Mm-hmm. And about 500 others. There's another shoe box full in the bedroom. You called it "Snake Man and Little Guy." And you didn't think this was weird? It creeped me out at the time. I wanted to take you to therapy, but your father said it was... quote, "white people sh1t." I still think it is. No offense. We just felt you needed to see these... after what you told us. I appreciate that. I thought I had an answer, and now I have more questions. You know, uh, Nancy seemed pretty shaken up. I'm gonna go check on her. Sorry, Gina. I just... Okay, um, maybe that's a good stopping place. Ennis, can we use the barn next week? Oh, no. The barn's booked for a wedding. Yeah, can I say something? We should take a break. What do you mean? [Animals grunting] I mean... what is that? Calista, shut up. Look around. You know, we're half gone. We're in a barn. Seems like we're just forcing it. It doesn't really feel like group anymore. Doesn't. And I know what groups feel like. I'm in a lot of groups. I'm in... I'm in, uh, the Knitting Circle, and then Let's Take a Hike With Seniors and Death Talk Cafe... Okay! Okay, okay. Okay, cool. Okay, cool. Great. So, our next meeting is TBD. Or how about not at all? How about that? Oh, no. No, that's extreme. No, no. Oh, is it? Is that extreme, Margaret? Well, how's... how's this for extreme, okay? Holding this entire group... on my shoulders for all of this time, okay? Holding... trying to find places to meet... and trying to help people... and giving and giving and giving... and giving and giving and giving and giving... until there is nothing left of the giving tree! Do you know what happens then? It dies! And everybody sits around on the stump of the tree! Good! Why don't you just have your meetings... [Yells] You know what? Maybe  I  need a break. Aah, [bleep] it! It's TBD! ♪ ♪ [Exhales deeply] Judy : [Laughing] Ronald : [Moaning] Oh, shh. What? You're gonna wake up Ozzie. Oh, this just gets weirder and weirder. [Cellphone vibrating] Jeff : Empathize... Nancy : ... With this.
