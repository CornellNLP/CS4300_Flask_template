 Previously on Pure Genius. 
 This is Bunker Hill Hospital. 
 Anything that you need to know is available at any time. 
 I didn't build this hospital to deliver bad news. 
 I had the same philosophy here  as I did building my company in Silicon Valley. 
 Best idea wins. We're pairing the most brilliant minds in medicine with the most brilliant minds in technology. 
 This is the revolution, Dr. Wallace. I want to be part of this. 
 Bell :  Your family... 
 Wallace : I'll go home every weekend. I'll make it work. 
 Brockett : This is Louis Keating. Diagnosed with Gerstmann Sträussler Scheinker disease. Bell :  It's a neurological disease. It's like ALS on steroids. There's only been one case of GSS in the bay area in the last 50 years. Bell :  I did have the genetic test done. And it came back positive for GSS. Louis :  All of the hospitals have been pretty clear. There's nothing that can save me. We don't give up on people around here, Louis. Okay, James. We're gonna make you yourself again. I could really look like that? Bell : You will look like that. We've been working with some new technology where we print skin made of your own cells directly onto your wounds. So, we use a scanner to map the face and determine the arrangement of skin cells. And then load the data into a 3-D bioprinter The printer then prints out the new skin directly onto your face, and, boom, you look just like you did before. (both chuckle) Hi, I'm Dr. Wallace. Hi. This is Amy Delgado. This is Izzy. This is our chief of staff. James, a word? (quietly): I'll be right back. Wallace :  We just discussed that the FDA  issued a blanket ban on any kind of bioprinting due to safety concerns. What you proposed to that woman is completely illegal. Listen, we've been working on this technology for a month. We found Amy Delgado, we invited her here before the ban even came into effect. That's not how the system works. Not to mention that the blanket ban is complete horse poo. It's meant for organs, which... okay, fine. Skin... skin is perfectly safe. I agree, but the last time I went up against the FDA, I lost my job. I almost lost my career. Maybe you remember. Yes, I remember. So let's not go up against the FDA, let's bring them here, or, more specifically, we bring  her  here. No. Absolutely not. Juliana Wallace, Executive Consumer Safety Officer for the FDA. You married up, W. I didn't disclose my wife's line of work to you on purpose, because I didn't want you to expect special treatment. I'm a tech billionaire, you think I can't Google "Walter Wallace wife?" No. And you don't know her, you won't convince her of anything. (chuckles) And we don't mix business with our marriage. It's too complicated. You don't have to. I'll do all the convincing. You just got to get her here. (sighs) You'll see, James. Once she's here, you stay out of it, I'll charm the pants off of her. Not the pants, I misspoke there. W, don't forget team building tonight. You're gonna love it! Everybody loves it! (players grunt) Oh, yes! (crowd cheering) (air horn blows) (indistinct announcement over P.A.) (crowd groans) (grunt) (crowd cheers and claps) Brockett : Oh! All right, um... remind me again how this is team building. Just eat the free nachos and be happy we don't have to do paintball again. (chuckles) You see his shirt? Brockett : Yeah? Cheng : What's "Twin Lakes?" I don't know, a town? He grew up in Newton, Massachusetts, Deerfield for high school, undergrad at Tufts, med school at Harvard, residency at UCLA, nowhere in there is a Twin Lakes. Are you still talking about this? Why don't you just ask him? Uh, absolutely not. No. (sighs) Hey, Scott. It's fun, right? I-I love hockey. And your shirt, it's great. Where'd you get it? Oh, um... my closet. Announcer : We're lucky to have with us tonight creator of the Bunker app and the founder of Bunker Hill Hospital... you all know him... (Bell laughs, Brockett cheers) give a nice warm welcome... Brockett : Yeah, James! .. To James Bell. (crowd cheering and applauding) (whoops) Yeah! (cheering continues) ♪ (crowd cheering, clamoring) (players grunt) (audience groans, whistle blows) Announcer : The officials have called for time-out. (crowd murmuring) Crap. That's not good. Let's go. Announcer : Fans, don't forget our next game is Tuesday night at 7:30. Team trainers have come out on the ice quickly to take care of Billy Watts. We're with Bunker Hill. Okay. Is he conscious? Mm-hmm. Hey, can you tell me your name? Billy Watts. Billy, hi, I'm Dr. Wallace. We're gonna look after you, okay? My head hurts real bad. Yeah, yeah, okay. Okay, let's get him over on his side. Okay, okay, okay. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah. Oh, damn. Channarayapatra : Put him back down. Easy. Channarayapatra : He's got an expanding left temporal hematoma. Probably a fracture of the middle meningeal groove. Flashlight? Here. Thank you. Epidural bleed? Left pupil's dilated. High pressure bleeding is pushing his brain down through the base of his skull. Got to relieve this pressure. How long do we have? Minutes. Channarayapatra : Hey. Oh, God. Find me a drill, a Black & Decker. Anything. Ask a custodian. Now. Okay. We need everything in your first aid kit. Here you go. Hey, come on, man, no cameras. What? I said no cameras, get out of here. All right, all right. Keep him out of here. Guys, let's get in. I need all of you to make a circle around him. Okay? Get in tight. Go! Nice and tight. All of you in. Protect him from the fans. Thank you. Alcohol? (drill whirs) All right, stabilize for the burr hole. Okay. Okay. Wallace (softly) : All right. Got it. Pupils are equally round and reactive. Billy? Billy, can you hear me? Yeah... yes. I can't feel my feet. (whimpers) ♪ It's a C-6 complete spinal cord injury. That's not how we do things down here. Paralysis of the hands, trunk, and legs. Billy Watts. Rookie center, came off the bench to lead the team in scoring. Hometown... Hartland, Minnesota; population, 311. Oldest of eight kids. Peaked out at five feet, seven inches; was told his whole life he was too small for hockey. First in his family to go to college. Graduated, went undrafted, eventually got picked up, and is now poised to sign a multi-million dollar contract at the end of the season after a break-out year. Hockey wasn't supposed to just change his life, it was supposed to change his entire family's life. So, what can we do for Billy? Channarayapatra : Unfortunately, we've had very little success with spinal cord injuries like this one. Well, we have had some success with epidural spinal cord stimulation. True, subjects showed some limited improvement in lower extremity movement. Where are we with stem cells? Gliomas. Huh? Here's the trouble with stem cells... theoretically, we can get them re-growing new nerve cells, but we don't know how to reliably stop that growth. Which creates a risk of cancerous spinal cord tumors. Gliomas. There is a surgery they did in Poland that used nasal olfactory ensheathing cells. Yeah, OECs are unique to the central nervous system. They help heal the nerves we use to smell after an injury. And OECs won't cause cancer since they're native to the nervous system. Cheng : Right, so they take the regenerative cells in the nose and suspend them in a hydrogel, creating like a liquid scaffolding, which fills in the injured parts of the spine. Scientists did it to this guy who'd been paralyzed from the chest down, and check it out. (indistinct talking) That's incredible. (people cheering on video) Can we do it? We can definitely try. That was a knife injury though, right? Spinal cord was cleanly severed. This is different. Cheng : I mean, we won't know for sure how Billy's injury would respond. Or if it would at all. Yeah, but it might. Yes. But it's a moonshot. The greatest predictor of a spinal cord victim's future success is the grueling work he needs to put in post-accident. Physical therapy, rehab, talk therapy. It's going to take a herculean effort from Billy. I'm gonna need him to give me everything that he's got on a daily basis. I cannot have him wag for a miracle, James. Noted. Let's go talk to him. James? Fine, you do the talking. I promise not to over-promise. Oh, and W, your wife is here. How do you know that? I see everything, W. Go. (clears throat) We're sorry. We know it's a tough diagnosis, Billy. How long did it take me to rehab my ACL? Six weeks. They said it was gonna be a year. Billy : People tell me no all the time. If I listened to them, I wouldn't be a professional hockey player. Billy, I believe that 100%. But a spinal cord injury is very different to a torn ACL. But people do still sometimes recover, right? If anyone can, Billy can. His coach says he works harder than anyone he's ever seen in his whole career. And that is gonna come in very handy once we start rehab. But I have to warn you, we start at the very beginning. Learning to sit up, to move your hands. You don't understand. My contract's up at the end of the season. I was gonna buy my parents a house. You guys are supposed to be the best hospital in the world. You got to fix me. There is... one... possibility. It's highly experimental. I don't want you to put too much hope in this, but he had similar injuries. Channarayapatra : Just to be clear, this was months after rehab. Man (on video) : You can do it. You can do it. Yeah. Come on. (cheering) Oh, my God. Billy, did you see that? I want that. This is one isolated case. There's no guarantee that... But that guy's just a regular guy. I'm a professional athlete. If he can swing a baseball bat again, I can play hockey again. I want the surgery. Hey. Sorry. Hi. Hi. That's okay. Hey, hon. How are you? Good. Oh, you... you look like... I am a wreck, I know. An all-nighter isn't as easy as it used to be. So how was your flight, okay? Yeah, it was good. How's Luke? Oh, he's in heaven, he's at the Rothstein's. (both chuckle) No rules Rothstein. Yeah. Oh and hey, how's the SAT prep? I just can't wait for that to be over. And by the way, I hate you for being gone during the SATs. You know how much I hate vocabulary flashcards. It's good to see you, Jules. You, too. Bell : Julianna. James Bell. Oh, hi. Great to finally meet you. Great to meet you, too. On behalf of myself and the entire hospital staff, welcome to Bunker Hill. Thank you. You're very welcome. And, uh, there's a gift basket, full of nice things. Make your stay more comfortable. Wow. Mmm. Uh, Ashland here is gonna take your luggage. Thank you, Ashland. Come on through. Wallace : James, um, since when do we have gift baskets? Uh, since 30 seconds ago. Keep up, W. Are you ready for your private tour? We'll find you later, W. We call this our garage. You name it, we're working on it. More precise biometric sensors than ever before. Used for early disease detection. Ingestibles and other microscopic cameras. Nanopore DNA sequencing and advanced genetic engineering. This. (sighs) This artificial womb. Eventually, we'll be able to help a fetus sustain life outside of the embryonic environment. Wow. Yeah. You're gonna love this. We've been working on it for a couple months. It's for amputees. How does it work? It's voice activated. Basically, the arm translates voice commands into complex, pre-programmed tasks. It has force sensors that help it grip objects in different ways. So, it knows how to pick up a bottle differently than, say, a grape. Pick up bottle. (arm whirring) (chuckling): Oh, wow. (gasps) Pick up grape. (arm whirring) We lost a lot of grapes in the process. You could always make wine. I've always wanted a winery. Next on my list. After saving the world. Amazing. (chuckles) How's the tour going? Hey. Well, I mean, I have to admit, I am very impressed. Come along, W. I was about to show Jules the E-Hub. It's gonna blow your mind. (Bell and Julianna chuckling) "Jules"? (whispers): It's in the bag. Julianna :  Bioprinting? No. There's no way. We've put months into this study. We just issued a blanket ban on all bioprinting. He knows that, right? You told him that? Yes. As our presentation demonstrated, we've run multiple animal model trials, and we've implemented safety measures to ensure that this procedure is absolutely safe on skin. Oh, yeah, I mean, your research is spectacular, and the presentation is unparalleled, but there are still risks. Infections, fibrosis. I-I understand that you're used to working in more unregulated environments, but you are going to have to learn to work with us and not around us, and follow the proper protocol. I am... following protocol. I'm requesting a one-time emergency exemption. No. Emergency exemptions are only used in life and death scenarios. And this is not life and death. I'm sure you explained to James about emergency exemptions. I did. Julianna : Okay. (sighs) This is a single mom who burned her face in a kitchen accident. She's a single mom. She needs her life back. And she will get her life back. Through skin grafts. And perhaps, in due time, through bioprint technology. When we know with absolute certainty, that it's safe. And maybe you and your hospital will get the first shot at it, but there's a reason for regulation. There's a reason why we have got to be very, very careful exploring these new technologies. We are dealing with people's lives. I'm so sorry, but I have conference calls right now that I can't miss. So, um, thank you very much for the tour. (clears throat) I really do respect what you're trying to do here. I'll see you at lunch? See you at lunch. Okay. Bye. I could've saved you the airfare. Channarayapatra : Surgery went very well, Billy. I don't feel any different. Well, as we said, the axons grow half a millimeter every day. And we have a 30 to 40 millimeter gap to fill in. It'll be at least 60 days before we could expect to see what kind of results it will yield. In the meantime, it's important we start to talk about learning to live in your new body. You have to learn how to monitor yourself in an entirely new way. You will have limited sensation below your level of injury. Which means you won't know when your bladder is full, or be able to empty it voluntarily. You will need to follow a new routine. What are you doing? Um, I'm gonna write everything down. So that... What's there to write down? I can't walk... got to learn to walk again. You'll use this to empty your bladder. I got to stick... I stick that up my... Could you please wait outside? It's okay. It's not okay. You have to do it every four hours. Dr. C showed me how it works. You guys talked about this? Baby, it's fine. I'm not embarrassed. So now you're telling me that I need my girlfriend's help to take a piss? I can't even go to the bathroom on my own? Baby... I can't hold your hand, okay? But I can still hold yours. I'm here for you. And I'm going to help you get through all of this. You're not my nurse! This is so stupid. James Bell told me I was gonna be playing hockey again. You showed me that video. We... we hope that the olfactory cell surgery will eventually help you achieve major progress. But as we... But I'm not gonna play hockey ever again? It's over. That's what you're saying, right? We can come back to this, okay? So let's just take some time out. No. Can you please leave? Billy... Can you please just go home? Get out of here! Show me how this damn this works. 
 
 Queen to rook three. (exhales) Checkmate. Got me again, Louis. (groans) It's the board. We need a new board, that's why I keep losing. (chuckling) How you feeling, Louis? Still trying to stay hopeful, James. Me, too. Julianna! Oh, hello, James. I was just meeting Walt for a bite. Adorable. Have you been to our dining hall yet? It's got a robot that serves frozen yogurt. It's a can't-miss. Did you get your action figure yet? Oh, yeah, I did. (laughs) Great pose. Very authoritative. Um, look... (sighs) I wanted to talk to you. I need you to know that I'm completely respectful of your professional opinion. I don't want that meeting to somehow dampen your visit here. And in the future, I'll be more careful to follow protocol and... Okay. Thanks, James. Yeah. (footfalls approaching) W, just the man I wanted to see. Hey. Hi. You killed it in that surgery. Oh, in medicine, we try to avoid the term "killed it." And to thank you, I wanted to give you the night off. The two of you, romantic dinner on the rooftop of Bunker Hill. World-class chef, top sommelier, the works. Well, that sounds great, but I actually, I can't... Oh, no, no. We do it for all our guests. Yeah. I dragged you all the way out here for nothing, please, let me make it up to you. (sighs) (chuckles) Okay, sure. Great. It's really kind of you. Thanks, James. Mm. Oh, W. Quick word about a patient. Yeah. One sec. FYI, it's not a romantic dinner, it's business. You got to help me get her on board. Well, you said just get her here and you'd take care of the rest. Yeah, that was before I met her. You were right, she's real stubborn. (sighs) You know it's the right thing to do for Amy Delgado. Just... spin your magic, W. ♪ Come on... Man : Hey! Billy! Where you at? Billy... (whooping) Billy... What's up, man? Yeah. Yeah, Billy. The whole team signed. Thanks, guys. (chuckling) Where's Amber? Oh, I sent her home. You know how emotional she gets. Yeah. I just can't deal right now. Yeah, same boat. Yeah. I am so sorry. If I hadn't of cross-checked Gorman, this... It's not your fault. It was total retaliation. I hit him and the next play, he lays you out. Jeffrey, shut the hell up. It was just a stupid accident. All right? You guys should go to the bar or something. Nobody wants to be here. I actually brought the bar here. (chuckles) Not water. (whoops) (chuckling): Just in case. Can you drink? You know, I'm already a cripple, what else is gonna happen? (laughter) Give me that cup. Let's load him on up, then. (chuckling) Uh... You might need to help me. Yeah. Brought up the bottle... Hey, to our number nine. Number nine. Number nine. To Watts. To Billy. Billy Watts. Billy Watts. Number nine. Cheers. Cheers. (chuckling): Yeah! (imitates wolf howl) (cheers) (exhales) That's it, Billy. Give me another one. (laughing): Yeah! Hell yeah. Yeah! Oh yeah!

♪ Lay your head on down. ♪ (crickets chirping, piano playing) There you are, sir. Thank you. Chairs. Hey, I forgot Jess used to say that. (chuckling): Yeah. Chairs. It's nice to have a moment alone together. Mm-hmm. Chairs to that. So, are you gonna do it now or later? Do what? Pitch me on the bioprinting. James asked you to convince me, didn't he? That's why we're up here. Yeah. See? This is the problem. He thinks that he can just buy his way around the rules. Yes. He does. Well, he can't. But at least we get a free couple of days together and... and an incredible dinner on a rooftop. So yay for us. (chuckles) (laughs) And for you, ma'am. Thank you. What? Nothing. No. I know that look. What? Yes, James thinks he can manipulate people and get what he wants, and believe me, it's annoying. But it all comes from a very serious and real desire to change the world, to help people who might otherwise fall through the cracks. Are you... are you saying that you agree, I should have approved the bioprinting? I didn't say that. You tried taking a shortcut around the FDA before. You know better than anyone about the consequences. The woman is suffering. She needs our help. And yes, in this case, I think the risks involved are minor. We just broke our own rule. See? We're not supposed to talk about work. I know. (sighs) Okay. Maybe the risks of this procedure are negligible, but there's still an FDA ban. I can't wave a magic wand and change that. And, you know, I just have to say one more thing. James Bell is the reason why we need regulation. He's why there is an FDA. (phone beeping) It's the hockey player that I operated on this morning. Okay. I... well, go. We'll talk about it later. ♪  ♪ (beeping, excited chatter) Channarayapatra : What happened? I'm sorry. He said it was okay for him to drink. And you listened? His blood pressure's 240/120. Cut it. It's dropping. Okay. How much did he have? A couple of shots. Administrate. Yeah, at most. Get out of here, guys. I'm sorry. (gasping) Okay. Here we go. Okay...

(groans) Two hours of sleep? Well. That's the job. They're sending a car for you at 11:00 to take you to the airport. Hey, I got your yogurts. Thanks. I wish... we could spend more time together. Yeah. Thanks for coming out. Yeah. You know, Walter, I did consider the case. Carefully. It is just not an emergency. This woman can wait a few months, you know, or a year, until the ban is lifted. And until then, it's a vanity case. I hear you. Safe flight. Okay. I love you. I love you. ♪ ♪ (indistinct chatter) How are you feeling? I feel fine. Billy. You could have died. I just had, like, a few shots. I know that this is a massive adjustment. But your body doesn't respond to pain the way it did before. There is no feedback from your brain. That's why your pressure skyrocketed. Hey, Billy. Amber wants to know if you're ready to see her. No. Channarayapatra : She wants to support you, Billy. Tell her to date someone on the team she doesn't have to give a sponge bath to every night. Can I go back to my room? Look at me, James. I'm a miracle. Just like you said. ♪ ♪ Why does it keep getting infected? We did the skin graft over a month ago. Without intact skin, your face has no protective barrier against the outside world anymore. We're giving you antibiotics to... bring your fever down, but I strongly suggest you consider letting us do another skin graft on you. Oh... A good full-thickness skin graft will prevent further infections. What about the bioprinting? That procedure is still very new. We'd hoped to get fast track approval of a special clinical trial. But the FDA, uh... feels the risk is too great. I don't understand. James said that he would fix my face. That is why I'm here. And we can. I believe I can do some skin grafting on you that can get us a better cosmetic result. I did that. It made it look worse! (sighing): Oh, my God. I don't think you understand. I'm a real estate agent. I sell houses. Since the accident, my commissions have been... (knocking on door) She's upset, is it okay if she comes in? Of course. Hey, sweetie. Izzy, your mom got medicine and feels much, much better, okay? Is this normal behavior? The thumb-sucking? No. I know this has been affecting her. Before the accident, we used to cuddle, I'd read her stories. Now, she won't even get close to me. If it's okay with you, how about I take her to our play room? Okay? (panting) (quietly): Good boy. This must be the famous Izzy. Hey. I'm Zoe. And this is Bunker. This hospital has its own dog? Mm-hmm. It's pretty cool, huh? Do you want to pet him? He's really friendly. No, thanks. You sure? I have a dog back home in Ohio. His name's Lasagna. Lasagna? Yeah. It's a pretty silly name for a dog. My daughter named him. (Bunker whimpers) BROCKETT: Aww, look at that. He wants you to rub his belly. You can if you want. See, he likes it. You scared of dogs, Izzy? No. I don't want to hurt it. Wallace : Oh, you're not gonna hurt him. You just have to be really gentle. No! Well, why do you think you're gonna hurt him? Because. I hurt everything. ♪  ♪ (exhales) Good job, Billy. That's great core stability. That's gonna help so much through physical therapy. Okay. We're gonna to start with this, and then work our way up to medicine balls, And from there, the sky's the limit, okay? Here we go. Ready? ♪  ♪ Can I get a little privacy? Yeah. Of course. (beeps) Billy's used to having 10,000 people explode in thunderous applause every time he slaps a puck into a net. And now, he needs to work ten times as hard just to throw a beach ball three feet. That procedure went great, and I really think those olfactory cells are gonna work. And if they don't, we're gonna find another way to help Billy. But right now... the guy he needs something immediate. A small miracle. Check this out. Brockett : James. Put that away. Bell : Functional electrical muscle stimulators. You know what they do? Yeah. Bruce Lee used that, didn't he? It's a technology for rehabbing athletes. They use electric currents to directly elicit muscle contractions. It's a shortcut to a six-pack. Exactly. So... What if we could make a sleeve out of these electrodes, to help Billy use his hands? How? That's what I need you guys to help me with. We'd have to convert electrical signals in the brain to digital signals. Bypassing his spinal cord entirely. So, you're saying we'd have to build some kind of interface for his brain. Well, if I built a microchip, could you implant it? It would be another surgery, but he's incredibly fit. I mean, he could handle that. And then I'd work with the patient to digitally convert his thoughts into hand movements. Do you think he'd go for it? I think we have to try. Angie, how fast can you build that chip? Couple days? Wrong answer. (chuckles) A couple hours. Okay. Let's do this! Yes! Uh, hey, Shirt. Uh, Scott. Hey, look. I hope I'm not overstepping my bounds here, but are you okay? Huh? Well, you just seem a little anxious lately. Or flustered. Oh, no. I'm not. I mean, I am. But you know, that's just me. Anxious. Flustered. Comes with the territory. (laughs) Well. Let me know if you ever need anything. Okay? Okay. (inhales) Julianna :  Hey. What's going on? I missed my flight. I know. Sorry to call you back. You'll get the next one, okay? No. What's this about, Walt? That's Izzy. She's six. Amy got pregnant by her boyfriend of eight years. And when he found out about the pregnancy, he split. It's just been the two of them since day one. What Amy didn't know about the accident is that Izzy feels responsible for it. Amy was carrying a boiling pot of water to the sink... she slipped backwards on some liquid and scalded her face. It was Izzy's bubbles. She was too scared to tell her mom, and, naturally, she was racked with guilt and fear. Jules, this is an emergency. It isn't vanity. That little girl has more scars than her mom. This is extreme emotional manipulation. Is it working? It-It's a huge professional risk that you're asking me to take, and I have an impeccable record. So no one's gonna question you. Right, unless something goes wrong. You want to meet her? Hi, Dr. Brockett. Hello. Hi, Izzy. This is my wife, Julianna. Hi. Your dog's named Lasagna. (chuckles): Yes, he is. You want to see a picture? (Brockett whispers indistinctly) All right, one time First-In-Human trial. That's it. I'll clear it with the Committee. Thank you. Brockett (chuckling) : Cute, huh? Super cute. We use this scanner to map te surface of your burn, Like a topographic map, so we can figure out the exact arrangement in which we need to print the skin cells. Then we put the data in the printer. And this is where you come in, Izzy. You see that button? When it's time, we're gonna tell you to push that button. Just this button, okay? And just once. And when you do, that printer is gonna start printing out your mommy's new face. But it won't work unless you push that button right when we tell you to. Think you can do that for us? Yes. Let me take you to one of our ambassadors. We have scrubs just for you. Bye, honey. I love you. Bye, Mommy.

I didn't fall in love with you because you were a hockey star. You really don't know? When I was 16, my parents got me a used car, and it was always having all kinds of problems. (chuckles) On our third date, we went to the movies, and the car got a flat. Billy said he was gonna fix it. So... here's this 16-year-old kid... He has no idea how to change a flat tire. It's Minnesota in January... I knew how to change a tire. You did not, but you figured it out. It took you an hour. And I thought to myself, here's a person who doesn't give up. Here's a person who can do anything. I hate you having to see me like this. Billy, I love you so much. Now hold my damn hand. (strained breath) (exhales) Okay. (whispering): "There once was a beautiful princess..." I told you we could do it. What'd I say? Bring her here. I'll take care of the rest. That is absolutely not what happened. I really think it was the gift basket. James, I need you to listen to me, and confirm that you're hearing what I say. We got that approval through on a loophole. Julianna took a big professional risk, and we're not gonna do that again. James. It's all set up and pre-programmed. Ooh, thank you, Angie. What are you doing with that? Do you think this should be in the gift basket? James. James! This might be a game to you, but it's not to me. This is my  marriage,  and you need to stay out of it from now on. It's not a game to me. It's a patient. I always put my patients first. Maybe you're too afraid to admit it, but you do, too, don't you? Your move, Louis. Rook to Knight Three. (robot arm whirring) (laughing): Great toy. How'd this happen? You know, Louis, I am gonna change the world, but sometimes you need a few small victories just to keep you going. Bishop to Knight Seven. (robot arm whirring) Checkmate. (sighs) (Louis chuckles) You couldn't have given me one small victory, Louis? (both laughing) Once more? My schedule is open. (chuckling) Bell : When did you know you were gonna beat me? When you walked in the room. Bell (chuckles) : Shut up. Yeah, right.
