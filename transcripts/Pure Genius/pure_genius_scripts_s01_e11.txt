 Previously on  Pure Genius... 
 Welcome to Bunker Hill,  where we are changing the world one patient at a time. 
 Julianna Wallace, Executive Consumer Safety Officer for the FDA. I wish you'd mentioned that the grim reaper  was coming here to ruin our GSS trial. Wallace :  Don't call her the grim reaper. I need more data from the animal models for approval of a human trial. The study wasn't approved. Wallace :  James. Bell :  Not now, W. Well, when you do have a minute... Damn it. So, how's the Malik sitch? Bell :  Malik's, uh, a good guy. And, uh, I moved on, so... Brockett :  You're gonna find someone really special, James. Keep your heart open, okay? Okay. I can't believe we over-snoozed. Waze says 14 minutes. We'll be fine. Pretty sure that's my shirt. Yes, it is. There you go. (phone buzzes) Is that my phone or yours? It's yours. It's a text from James. Who's Angelica? Angelica? Oh. Angeleeca. Who's Angeleeca? It's this amazing breakfast taco place we found when we pulled an all-nighter on the obesity case. It's like insane. You want me to have him pick something up for you? Nah. I'm okay. You sure? Homemade flour tortillas, eggs, chorizo, melted Monterey Jack cheese. Are you really trying to seduce me with taco talk right now? Maybe. Is it working? Mmm. Damn right... but we got to go. (birds chirping) Any time I rub up against something these painful blisters open up. This morphine pump follows me around everywhere I go, like it's the family pet. So you think there's a way to keep it from spreading? Do you think the ECP treatment will work? We believe it will. How long does something like that take to work? You'll need to do a cycle every four weeks, and we anticipate that it'll be at least four to six months before we see any marked improvement. But we will cure her. Wow. This is... We can't thank you enough. I'm super grateful. This is the best news I could have hoped for. But four to six months... I guess that means no prom. (sighs) Honey. Lydia's senior prom is this weekend. She had to drop out of school when she was diagnosed. She misses her friends. Brockett : I'm so sorry. I blew mine off. We don't even have prom in India. Bell : Okay, so we'll get started. Dr. Brockett and I have another patient to see to. We do? Mm-hmm. Oh, right. Angeleeca. Mm. Really delicious. That is really good. Malik, we're needed in the ER. Yes, sir. Can I ask you a question? Do you and James have any private things, just between the two of you? Uh, just square dancing every Friday night, and our glee club. No, we don't have any private things. He and Zoe have this thing with breakfast tacos. Like their own special place. I think it's more innocent than that, Malik, Yeah, I know. I honestly have no idea why it's bugging me. You know what? It's not. Man : Get off me! I didn't do anything! (man mutters indistinctly) Officer, what's going on? We need clearance to take this man to the station. Get out of here! Leave me alone! A couple of businesses called to complain about a homeless drunk wandering around the area the last few days. He was disturbing people, he was agitated. His breath reeks of whiskey. I got to get out of here. Where am I? You're in a hospital, Mister... Officer : He doesn't know his name. He doesn't have I.D. He was sweating a lot. His face was red, and, uh, we decided just to bring him in and get him checked out first. Verlaine : You do a breathalyzer on him? Didn't have to. You smell his breath. (man panting) Blood alcohol zero. Seriously? Blood-sugar level is high. 570. That fruity smell on his breath, it's not alcohol, it's ketones. They're produced when there's not enough insulin in your blood. What is that? It's a Thomas the Tank Engine tattoo. I used to read those books to Luke. I-I think this guy's got kids. Officer, you need to uncuff him. He's not drunk, and I doubt he's homeless... he's sick. He needs to be admitted. We're gonna take care of you. Okay? If there's anyone in the area looking for a missing person matching his description, send them to Bunker Hill. Sir? Tell me your name, sir. (mutters indistinctly) Afternoon, Nina. Louis. Up for a game of chess? I'm feeling lucky. (chuckles) I think Louis maybe just needs to rest today. Uh... (quietly): I knew he was getting worse, but how long has he been like this? His symptoms progressed rapidly overnight. The dysarthria is making it difficult for him to speak. He's having difficulty eating and swallowing. Soon, he may need a nasal gastric feeding tube. He doesn't have much longer, James. Okay. W. I need your advice. Yes, James? Louis Keating isn't doing well. Yes, I heard. I'm so sorry. And I've... Mm-hmm. I've looked into every possible solution, and the only recourse, the only thing that could possibly save him is the PAI-120B We're not approved to use that. The FDA ruled against it. My wife personally handled the decision. Is there any way that you could talk to her? Just ask her one more time, please? W... he's not gonna make it. James, I know how hard this is, how personal it is for you. I will ask, but I'm certain they won't reverse their decision. But you'll ask? I'll ask. What are you doing? Try to calm down, sir. We're just giving you some more saline. Get me out of here. I'm sorry I had to restrain you, but you kept pulling out your IV. You'll feel better soon. Something's not right. His blood-sugar levels are coming down, and his heart rate and blood pressure are normalizing. His confusion should have cleared up by now. Yeah. Dr. Wallace, the police directed his family here. Nathan! Oh, my God. Daddy? You know this man? Yeah. He's my husband. Hey, Nathan. We're here. Who are you? Earlier this week, he was totally normal. Then two day's ago, Bobby's preschool called me. Nathan never showed to pick him up, and he wasn't answering his phone. I was on a business trip in Arizona, and I flew back right away. What's happening to him? We believe his diabetes got out of control, and he couldn't adjust his blood sugar, which made him confused and combative. I don't understand. What do you mean, “diabetes”? Nathan's not diabetic. Are you sure? Yes. Has he taken any new medications? No, nothing. He's been healthy. How could this happen, just out of nowhere...? What's wrong with Daddy's eye? Dr. Wallace. Nathan? Nathan, can you look straight ahead at me, please? Get me out of here! What's going on? The muscle responsible for his eye movement is paralyzed. (alarm beeping) His oxygen saturation level is dropping. Wallace : His diaphragm's weakening. Paralysis is spreading. Nurse : Doctor? Bobby : Daddy? I need a BiPAP machine in here right now! Yes, Doctor. Okay, we're gonna have to ask you to leave. Please. He's okay. He's in good hands, trust me. Boy  (on phone): Don't sweat it, Lydia. I'll take tons of pictures and I'll come visit you on Monday. We'll have a Nick Cage marathon. I thought the point was to make me feel better? Oh... (laughs) Uh, hey, I got to run. Doc's here. Okay. See ya. Sorry, didn't mean to interrupt. Okay, you're all done with the infusion. We'll just have to monitor you overnight. Was that your boyfriend? No. Pete's just a friend. He asked me to go to the prom a few months ago, before my EB came on. I called to tell him that I'm not going to be able to make it. Well, I'm sure he understands. He's your friend, right? Yep. But you want him to be more than that? Pretty sure that's not gonna happen. Why do you say that? Well, he's never really seen me in that way. Pete could have asked anyone to prom. But he chose you. Don't give up on him. He'll probably ask somebody else now. I just had this image in my head of strutting into prom wearing my kick-ass dress. My hair and makeup on point and... ...and Pete would see me in this whole new light. (sobbing): It's so stupid. I don't think that's stupid at all. Wallace : Nathan's MRI shows white spots in the areas of the brain that control eye movement and respiration. This inflammation is causing his paralysis. What is the commonality here? What would explain the eye deviation, confusion and high blood sugar? His spinal fluid did show the presence of lymphocytes. So we know his immune system's reacting to something. Bacterial cultures on the spinal fluid were negative. Yeah, but the lymphocytes are more indicative of a viral infection. Well, I ran a virus panel on all the usual suspects, but so far, nothing's shown up. So if it is a viral infection, we don't know what's causing it. The fact that it's affecting multiple organ systems concerns me. This could get worse very quickly. Maybe we go back to basics. When I was a programmer and I had a virus in one of my codes, I'd go line by line to try to pinpoint the problem. What if we do that with Nathan? Study each strand of DNA piece by piece. You're talking about sequencing the human genome. That can only be done at the CDC. Not anymore. We have a DNA sequencing machine right here. We can do all this in-house. Certain types of viruses can integrate themselves into our DNA. Once you locate the problematic strand, the one that doesn't belong, you can identify what's making him sick. But isn't that like looking for a needle in a haystack? Doesn't it take an entire day for current DNA sequencing machines to run their algorithm? We've been developing new algorithms that should cut the time in half. Maybe. Hey, it's worth a shot. Right now, it's the best option we've got. (whirring) Broccoli? More specifically, sulforaphane. It's a naturally occurring compound found in broccoli. It's shown great promise in studies on lab mice to quickly heal blisters and improve the integrity of the skin. This process allows us to take broccoli and extract sulforaphane from it through solid-phase extraction distillation. Like taking vitamin C out of an orange. We already have a good plan for Lydia. Yes, but that plan won't get her to prom. How about we use virtual reality? I can get her in the gym using VR. Such a male idea of prom. You cannot virtually go to prom. Mm-hmm. You have to physically be there. School dances are evil events that make 99% of the students miserable so that the one percent can have a magical night. Guessing you didn't have a good senior prom. Fantastic. Stayed home, ordered pizza, and watched  Star Wars. I think that we need to let go of this prom idea. This broccoli test, it worked in mice. But humans have a larger surface area. Sulforaphane would need to be applied regularly over Lydia's entire body, a-almost like a spray. Which is why we liquefied it. Voilà, purified sulforaphane. It also took four days to see results in that study. Well, we can modify our hyperbaric oxygen chamber and speed up the healing process. Yeah, like a horizontal spray tan booth. Exactly. Inside the chamber, elevated air pressure and high oxygen concentration would stimulate the body's release of growth factors and stem cells. She would need to be in there for at least eight hours, and it would only treat the superficial layer of her skin. Guys, there will be other dances. No, actually, there won't. There's only one senior prom. Ooh. Uh... let's give it a shot. Fantastic! Angie, let's get to work. Thank you, James. Yeah. Louis? Louis? Uh... No, no. (elevator dings) Was Louis Keating brought down here? Uh, no, I'm-I'm sorry, Mr. Bell. Okay, thank you. I need you to pull up Louis Keating's location using his tracking bracelet. (beeping) He's in Golden Gate Park. Brockett : Remember, this is just a stopgap measure to get you to prom. This is not a cure. Our long-term plan for a cure is to continue with the ECP treatments, which will heal the deeper layers of your skin. If this works, I'll never complain about eating my vegetables again. Okay, if you need to get our attention for any reason, just press this button, and it will alert us right away. See you in eight hours. Man : All set, Doctor. All right, process initiated. I feel good about this. I can't believe James thought VR would be a good alternative. See, this is why he needs a woman in his life. Actually, I think he may soon have one. You know something. Spill it. Okay, my sources tell me James has the hots for the new nurse, Nina. Nina. Wow. That's excellent news. That is... that is really excellent. I mean, she's, she's hot. And I told him to move on, so, so good for him. That is really excellent. Said that already. I... Well, it is. (both chuckle) Yeah. ♪ ♪ (indistinct chatter) James : Nina! What are you doing here? Hi, James. Our new friends Hector and Caleb are just about to start a new game. I thought, when he wasn't in his room... You can't just... remove a patient from the hospital without permission. Come on. I put in a request, and I should've waited for approval. I apologize. But look at him. He's at peace here. I could fire you for this. You know that? Are you, are you going to? (exhales) Still mulling it over. I wish there was more we could do, too. Louis told me about the new drug you're developing for GSS. The PAI-120B. The FDA didn't approve it. Said it wasn't ready yet. How long will it take for the FDA to think it'll be ready? Six to 12 months. Well, he doesn't have anywhere near that long. I know. W-We're going back to the FDA to see if they'll reverse their decision, but I'm not... I'm not gonna go against them. It's too dangerous. I can't... I can't risk the hospital, all of the patients. It's not... Eh... Mm-hmm. You know, it's funny. (chuckles) Here you are, this billionaire. Started your own hospital so you could do something different. But even someone like you can't get around the system, even if it's the only way to save someone's life. It's not... that simple, Nina. Isn't it? ♪ ♪ 
 
 This is the sequence of nucleotide base pairs from Nathan's DNA sample. I compared his full genome sequence to a database of all the known genes and DNA base pair sequences. There was one sequence that remains unidentified. An anomalous strand of DNA. That's our virus. Most likely. What kind of variant is it? That's the problem. It doesn't exist in any of our databases. Are you saying it's never been seen before? It may be the DNA of a virus we've never seen. But whatever it is, it's not human. Brockett : You ready? Oh, my God. I think I forgot what my actual skin looked like. Channarayapatra : Hmm. Yeah, the epidermis is smoothing out. And the color looks good. Brockett : We still need to monitor your progress over the next 24 hours, give your skin a little more time to heal, but this is very promising. Channarayapatra : We will be back later to check on you. But be cautious. Your deeper layers are still fragile. (chuckles) You're saying some kind of animal did this to him? Many viral infections originate in an animal before crossing over into humans. It's important that we know exactly what the animal was in order to know how to treat Nathan. The BiPAP machine is helping Nathan breathe, but his diaphragm is steadily weakening. We're going to need to intubate. You mean put him on life support. We're just stabilizing him while we look for a cure. And what if you can't find one? Does that mean he may never wake up? It's possible. (exhales) You should see the way Bobby holds Nathan's hand so tight when we cross the street. Or when he's scared. Nathan's the hand-holder in this family. It's all Nathan. He takes care of Bobby. I work. I don't know if I could do this on my own. We're going to do everything we can so that you don't have to. What am I supposed to tell Bobby if he isn't able to ever say good-bye to his father? There is a way we can get Nathan coherent before we intubate. Dr. Wallace... If we administer steroids, it could temporarily reduce the swelling around his brain and his eye nerve. But we'd also run the risk that the steroids could cause his blood sugar levels to rise again. I know this is what Nathan would want. He'd risk anything to be able to talk to Bobby right now. I know. Of course. I understand. The steroids may also weaken his immune system... We'll be monitoring him closely. We can do this. Dr. Wallace, that is too much of a risk to that patient. Right now we don't have a path to saving Nathan. He's a father. It's possible the best we can do for him is give him a chance to say good-bye to his family. You need any help in there? Be careful. Lydia : I got this. Ready? (Rose exhales) You look absolutely perfect. I kind of do, don't I? Yeah. (gasps) (laughter) (female screaming) Lydia? What's wrong? Help her, please. I'm so sorry. I shouldn't have tried to hug her. I just got carried away. What happened? The sulforaphane only treated the outer layer of her skin. Her deeper layers can't withstand any sudden movement or friction. Topical anesthetic, please. This spray is a numbing agent to help with the pain. (crying) (sniffles, sighs) (sighs) I heard what happened to Lydia. How is she doing? Look, I get that this is hard for you to understand, but a girl only gets one senior prom, and she's not gonna be able to go. I know I said the prom is evil, which is true. It's not the whole story. (sighs) There was this girl, Aubrey Diaz, and I obsessed for weeks over how to ask her, so I made a video of me outlining 16 reasons why Aubrey Diaz should go to prom with me. Wow. That's impressive! Mm. Yeah, would have been, if she hadn't accepted the invitation of someone else a few days earlier. Apparently, I was the last to know. And, you know, the hardest part of the whole thing... was that I just... missed my window. With her. So... tell me about prom. What am I missing? Why is it so important? Okay. So, uh, got really angry after my mom died. Sort of shut down in high school. Go to class, come home, and I hid. More and more, I just kind of disappeared. I definitely was not going to prom. But then... this guy asked me. (chuckles) Let's just say he was not the captain of the football team. But he was kind and really sweet. Mm. We had a great time. And... for the first time since my mom died, I smiled. You know? Felt like I woke up out of a really long sleep. When I look at Lydia, I... can kind of see her going down the same road that I went down, and I don't want to see that. I don't want that for her. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Yeah. Nathan? Nathan, my name is Dr. Wallace. Can you hear me? Yes, I can... (panting) Am I in a hospital? I'm sorry to say you've contracted a virus. We're having trouble identifying what it is. So you don't know what's making me sick? Not yet. While we search for a cure, I'm going to need to intubate you to keep you breathing. (breathes loudly) I know you're scared, Nathan. This is the hardest thing in the world. But the best thing for you to do right now is to be strong for your son. (sighs) You ready? Hey, Bobby. All right, Bobby, be gentle on your dad, okay? I'm sorry, Daddy. Are you okay? I'm so okay. Hey, kiddo, this must be pretty scary, huh? A little. Listen to me, okay? This is all gonna be okay, and the three of us... this will all go back to normal, okay? Bobby : You promise? I promise. Now come here, give Daddy a hug. A gentle hug. I love you so much. I love you, too. Now let your dads talk for a minute, okay? Okay. Come on, buddy. Nurse : Come on, Bobby. I got something to show you. I can't believe this is happening. (sighs) Listen to me, Seth. Yeah. I know I'm gonna pull through this, but just in case, you got to promise me some things, okay? Okay. Anything. Read to Bobby every night and do the voices. I know you feel silly, but he loves it. I want him to grow up in a home where it's okay to be silly. Okay, I can do that. And you need to be the dad I know you can be. (breathes loudly) And finish the swing set I was working on in the shed. I cut all that wood myself. Don't you dare go to Wal-Mart and buy one of those plastic monstrosities. (breathes loudly) Malik, I think I might know what happened to Nathan. What is it? It's a long shot, but it's a chance. Let's go find Scott. We need a search party. Wallace : We're up against the clock here. Nathan's been working in his shed on a swing set the past few weeks. Could've come in contact with a bug that may have infected him. Maybe a beetle, carpenter ant. Sheds are dark and damp. It's a perfect breeding ground. Okay. Let's turn this place upside down. Brockett. I think I found a way to get Lydia to the prom. Bell : This is bionic e-skin. It's being developed by a company in China to protect the feet of diabetics with peripheral neuropathy, but we have modified it to cover your entire body. Brockett : Serves as a protective barrier between your skin and any contact that can cause wounds. The e-skin will also transmit touch sensation to the nerve in the deeper layers of your skin. Layered on the damaged areas of your skin, almost like a wet suit. And we'll be there with you at prom, make sure everything goes according to plan. And she'll be able to walk? The blisters in the soles of her feet are the most painful. It should also protect her feet. Let's try it out. Okay. (lightly groans) Uh... Mm. (Lydia sighs) So, I'll have to hold off on flashing my dance moves for awhile, but I still get to go to the prom. Thank you. This is awesome. So, did you ask her about it? And what am I supposed to say? “I was spying on you and James having an intimate moment”? Nah. I'm not some jealous dude. But you were spying on her. No, I wasn't spying on her. I came across the situation, and that, together with the taco situation, I mean, come on. Wouldn't you at least be a little concerned? Ah, it's a lot to think about. Probably why I became a priest. (scoffs) WALLACE: Gentlemen. I found something. Verlaine : What is it? A tick. Mm, it looks like there might be a small colony of them living in this pile. But we already checked Nathan for Lyme disease. Well, the tick may be carrying another disease, one we haven't seen before in humans. Just like swine flu. It's carried by pigs and then jumped species. Well, we need to take it back to the lab to see if it carries the same disease Nathan has. If it does, could be the answer to our cure. (door opens) (door closes) Hey. What are you doing here? Uh... making sure Lydia can dance at her senior prom. Blue LED lights stimulate the body's natural production of nitric oxide, which improves circulation and reduces pain. I just got to figure out a way to fit the soles of these slippers with these LED lights. What's Cinderella without her slippers, right? So, I... heard you might be interested in Nina... new nurse on the third floor. “Interested”? Uh, I don't know. I think it's great. I think you should ask her out. (chuckles) I don't know about that. Aubrey Diaz doesn't know what she missed out on. Verlaine : Zoe. Ready to head out? Yeah, you know what, um... I think I should probably stay here and start cutting the e-skin. You can get some sleep. You can do that in the morning. Sure? Yeah. Okay. Good night, James. Night. So, who's Aubrey Diaz? Oh, it's just this story James told me. I probably shouldn't... Right. No, no. Got it. I guess I just didn't realize you guys had that kind of relationship. All these secret things. Malik. Come on. Look. I'm sorry I got to ask this, but something feels off here, Zoe. Did anything ever go on between you and James? No. Never. We're just friends. That's it. I heard back from Julianna. She took it to the top level, but I'm sorry, James. They're not gonna reverse their decision. Oh. I'm so sorry, James. We'll keep him as comfortable as we can. Thank you, W. How is Nathan doing? He's been intubated. And we confirmed the tick's carrying the same virus that infected him. It's a brand new neurosclerotic disease. I alerted the CDC. They're issuing a warning. How long did it take the disease to kill the tick? The tick is still alive, which means its developed antibodies to keep the virus at bay. So we can harvest the tick's plasma, which contains its natural immunities to the virus, and inject it into Nathan. That's great news. It's never been tried in humans before. And it is a foreign substance; Nathan's body could reject it completely, or even worse, it could cause his system to go into a state of shock. What does the FDA say? Well, under their own guidelines, we don't need to seek approval in an emergency situation. We have hours here. Not days. Good. I'd rather ask for forgiveness than seek permission. Treatment is a risky move. I'm not entirely comfortable with it. Do you regret the decision you made back in Ohio? Giving the boy with leukemia the unapproved drug? My gut told me I had to do anything I could to keep that boy alive. No matter what. What is your gut telling you now? That I need a sandwich before I go injecting tick plasma into a human being for the first time ever. They can't just be functional. They got to be elegant. And cool. (exhales) What do you think? I think that you just added cobbler to your resume, James. (laughs) All right. One last step, and it's off to the ball. (imitates gunshots) (chuckles softly) ♪ I've been silent partner ♪
