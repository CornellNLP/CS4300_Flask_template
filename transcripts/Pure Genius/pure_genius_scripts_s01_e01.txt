 Man : Dr. Wallace, on August 14 of this year, did you knowingly provide a chemotherapy treatment called aladictin to Marshall Foster, an eight-year-old patient? 
 Wallace : Yes, I did, Ed. 
 And at the time you administered the treatment, were you aware that aladictin was in the trial stage, and not approved for use? 
 Uh, let me make this simple for all of us. 
 I gave him the treatment, I knew it wasn't FDA approved... and, uh... he died. 
 Ed :  It pains me enormously to have to say that we have no choice but to discharge you. 
 She's 15 years old and healthy. 
 She's never been sick a day in her life. 
 She is in there. I know she's in there. 
 Mr. and Mrs. Ramirez, I understand how frustrating this is. 
 "Frustrating"? Our 15-year-old daughter is in a coma. 
 Mr. Ramirez :  She came home from volleyball practice last week, had dinner, went to sleep, and never woke up. 
 And no one seems to be able to tell us what went wrong, or how to get her back. 
 You don't even answer our calls. 
 How would you feel if this was your daughter? 
 Dr. Gilroy, this is Dr. Channara... 
 Channarayapatra. 
 Nice to meet you, Dr. Gilroy. 
 Mrs. Ramirez : Oh, my God, you're here. 
 You came. 
 Mr. and Mrs. Ramirez, your request to transfer your daughter to Bunker Hill has been approved. 
 Doctor, this patient is in no condition to be transported by ambulance. 
 Which is why I brought the helicopter. 
 Uh, helicopter... 
 We can't... 
 Mr. Ramirez, there will be no charge to your family as long as you're at Bunker Hill. 
 I just need you to sign a document releasing your daughter to our care. 
 (indistinct announcement over intercom) 
 Excuse me, I'm here to... 
 Dr. Wallace. 
 If you place your thumb on the tablet, I can give you full access to the hospital. 
 Actually, I'm only here a few days to observe. 
 James wanted you to have permanent access. 
 (computer blips and beeps) 
 Dr. Wallace, we need to scan you. 
 Give me 30 seconds and permission  to map your entire body, and I'm going to give you a plastic action figure of yourself. 
 How would you like to be immortalized, Dr. Wallace? 
 Good, not great. 
 How about...? 
 Will? Ehh... 
 So... 
 I can work with that. 
 (scanner softly trilling) 
 Dr. Wallace. 
 Welcome to the revolution. 
 Come with me. 
 Thanks. 
 Thanks, Anabel. 
 Of course, James. 
 He knows my name is Angie, not Anabel. 
 It's a thing we do. 
 Wallace :  I thought I made it clear when they called  that I can't entertain a job offer out of state. 
 I heard. Shrewd negotiating tactic. 
 It's not... 
 This is Brockett. 
 Double board certified in internal medicine and pediatrics, with a fellowship in critical care, and my first hire. 
 Dr. Wallace, it's an honor to have you join the team. 
 Wallace : Does everybody here think that I'm actually...? 
 Come check this out, Doctor. 
 I cannot wait to show you this. 
 Stick your finger in the tube intake. 
 Oh... 
 It's a finger prick blood test. 
 We keep better tabs on our patients with more routine monitoring. 
 Now, check this out. This is the Wall. 
 It's mission control for every patient. 
 CT scans, MRI, any imaging, all the labs, anything that you need to know or the patient wants to know is available at any time. 
 And when it's not medical, the patient gets to choose where they want to be. 
 Machu Picchu. 
 Buddhist temple. 
 Earth rising over the moon. 
 Studies show that patients eat better, they sleep better, they have better recoveries, if they feel more control over their environment. 
 (cell phone chimes) 
 Oop. 
 Got your results through there, W. 
 You blood glucose is slightly low. 
 Here, eat that. 
 "W"? 
 He likes nicknames. 
 Mr. and Mrs. Beyer. 
 Welcome to Bunker Hill. 
 Hi. 
 Thank you so much for having us, Mr. Bell. 
 You've given us hope. 
 Well... this is Dr. Wallace, hands down one of the best surgeons in the world. 
 We heard you get the best of the best. 
 To be accurate, I'm only here to... 
 And this is Dr. Brockett. 
 She's going to be your physician advocate. 
 Okay, what is that? 
 She's going to be your touchstone. 
 But she's not your only touchstone. 
 Everyone on the team here is part of an information matrix. 
 You'll be able to reach out to anybody, and they'll be able to help you, okay? 
 Zoe. 
 Margo, because of your pregnancy, you chose not to have chemotherapy or radiation, which would have shrunk or controlled your lymphoma. 
 It has grown over time, and the blue mass you see here is the tumor. 
 And as it grows, it becomes more difficult to address surgically. 
 But we feel we can do so. 
 You're saying you can operate? 
 They told us it was too late. 
 Well, what about the baby? 
 Show them. 
 Can you lift your shirt up, please? 
 At 20 weeks, the fetus is less than a pound. 
 Its lungs and heart aren't able to sustain itself outside of the womb, and most likely won't be able to for two weeks. 
 Well, we made it very clear when we sent in our application for a transfer, a-abortion's not an option. 
 I understand, but if we wait until the fetus is viable, it will be too late. 
 For our baby? 
 For both of you. 
 Mr. Bell, they told us that Margo couldn't get pregnant. 
 This child's a miracle. 
 Brockett : Margo, at the rate your cancer is growing, we don't have weeks to act. 
 We have days. 
 Then we will pray. 
 We'll pray for weeks. 
 We'll find a way. 
 I didn't build this hospital to deliver bad news, so we will find a way to save both you and your baby. 
 We have a lot of work to do. 
 Bell : Let's get past the semantics. 
 I've already decided to hire you. 
 Congratulations, Chief of Staff. 
 My youngest will be graduating in a year. 
 Until then, I'm not leaving Ohio. 
 I can work with this. I need you to start now, you need to start in a year. 
 That is a problem that is solvable. 
 In the meantime, you should... change your specs. 
 My specs? 
 Spectacles, glasses... they go against everything that you are. 
 You have no idea who I am. 
 You risked your career to save a kid's life. 
 I didn't save his life. He died. 
 Well, you tried. 
 You're a cowboy, you're a badass. 
 I like you in thick black rims. 
 I'm thinking retro Clark Kent. 
 Look, I appreciate what you're trying to do here, but I have to be honest... gadgets and gizmos have been around the medical industry forever. 
 They come and go. The great majority of diagnoses has zero to do with technology. 
 It's about doctors talking directly to patients. 
 Medicine is ultimately a human endeavor. 
 Good speech, W. 
 Let me show you why you're dead wrong. 
 (electronic chime) 
 This is the E Hub. 
 Malik... meet Dr. Wallace. 
 Dr. Wallace, I heard your Melankopf lecture at the NIH in February... it was amazing. 
 Malik grew up dirt poor in the East Bay area. 
 Total gangbanger. He went along on hits. 
 You did time, am I right? 
 You don't exactly have to lead with that, but yes, that is accurate. 
 Yeah, so he was tired of seeing his friends and family members having suboptimal healthcare outcomes, dying an average of 15 years younger than people in different zip codes with higher incomes, so, um, we set this up. 
 Uh, you can show him. You show him. 
 Cool, um... 
 This is Mary. 
 56 years old, affected by epilepsy. 
 Now, we can monitor the blood levels of her seizure meds in real time by using this. 
 It's a flexible adhesive computer with bioactive gel interface. 
 You stick it on your arm, it monitors everything about you. 
 If her Keppra level drops, we can command it to deliver an additional dose of medicine. 
 How long did it take you to get this program up and running? 
 Homeboy had the idea eight months ago? 
 Yeah, about right. 
 Here we are. 
 No red tape, Doctor. 
 We're pairing the most brilliant minds in medicine with the most brilliant minds in technology, and we're going to take out the middleman. 
 We're gonna get stuff done. 
 This is the revolution, Dr. Wallace. 
 Okay, let's drill down on Margo Byer. 
 I want to hear everything we know about delivering a fetus at 20 weeks. 
 We've got the aliens customizing an ingestible to get the most accurate read possible of the fetus' lung and heart development. 
 I like that. 
 Let's see it bigger. 
 It's a tiny supercomputer. 
 The patient takes it orally, like any other pill, and it travels into her intestines, which just happens to be the perfect vantage point to see the womb. 
 What if it doesn't land exactly where you want it to? 
 I had our tech team modify it with magnetic sensors. 
 It'll be the first ingestible in the world with motion control. 
 We'll be able to measure the lung and heart capacity of the fetus more precisely than ever before, and can predict down to the hour when it'll be able to survive outside its embryonic environment. 
 Excellent work, Anabel. 
 So, now that we know down to the hour when the fetus can survive, the question becomes, how do we keep Margo Byer alive long enough to get there? 
 I'm sorry, but can I just say something? 
 And here comes the reality police. 
 Tumor mass is filling the pericardial space and causing tamponade. 
 Her blood pressure is dropping. She is getting weaker. 
 The sicker she gets, the lower her chances of surviving surgery. 
 We have to play hardball... tell them we operate, or they go home with comfort care. 
 Okay, thank you. 
 I don't need anybody telling me no right now. 
 I need ideas. Good ideas, okay? 
 I want everyone on this. 
 We need to buy two weeks for that baby. 
 I will not accept that there isn't a way to bend time here. 
 Wallace : Not that I'm even considering your offer, but if I were to work here, I would need you to be a passive presence with patients. 
 Meaning? 
 Meaning, I've watched you promise Margo Byer an unrealistic outcome. 
 I can't have a layman offering medical opinion. Dr. Wallace, in this hospital, no one is a passive presence. 
 I have the same philosophy here as I did building my company in Silicon Valley. There's no hierarchy, no offices. 
 Best idea wins. Some research grunt has a better idea than someone with a Ph.D? It's still a better idea. 
 We all speak. We're a team. 
 Anna, take Dr. Wallace to the Nuclear Med Lab. 
 It's gonna blow your mind. 
 Dr. Wallace, this way. 
 How is she doing today? 
 The EEGs, the scans, the MRI's, all the monitoring, they don't give us any indication that Krissy is doing anything but withdrawing from the world. 
 I think it's time to talk to her parents about taking her off life support. 
 Krissy? 
 Krissy. James! 
 It has been six months. 
 This isn't going to change. 
 The data showed that she would come out of this. 
 And I promised her parents. 
 What am I supposed to say to them? 
 James, you can't make those kinds of promises. 
 How is she doing today? 
 No change today, Maria. 
 Uh, a few months ago, you said it was a good idea to read to her. Should we still do that? 
 Absolutely, Soul. 
 Yeah. You guys are doing a great job. 
 She loves animals. (chuckles) 
 Uh, we were planning to go on a safari together for her 16th birthday. 
 We're still planning on taking her one day. 
 (chuckles softly) 
 We know you won't give up on her, James. 
 It's what keeps us going every day. 
 Hi, baby. 
 Soul (whispering) : ...safari, it's a neat way to explore Africa... 
 (sighs) So, I just swallow this? 
 Mm-hmm. 
 Just like an aspirin. Simple. 
 Now, can we all pray first? 
 Oh, uh... Sure. 
 (inhales) Lord, please help this... what is it called? 
 Uh, fetal monitoring ingestible. 
 Fetal monitoring ingestible guide this team of Bunker Hill doctors, and help bring Angela into the world. And Lord Jesus... 
 Why don't you just ask her out? 
 Who? 
 Dr. Brockett. 
 (sighs) 
 You obviously want to. 
 What am I supposed...? 
 Just tell her you think she's really smart and attractive, and no pressure, but you'd like to take her out sometime, socially. 
 (laughing): Yeah, right. 
 Like I'm going to say anything like that to Zoe Brockett. 
 Oh, you're insane. 
 Good one, W. 
 ...no sickness or disease to enter our bodies and harm our health. 
 Amen. 
 Amen. 
 Amen. 
 Amen. 
 Verlaine :  Listen, Angie, 
 I grew up here, okay? 
 This is my neighborhood. 
 Point being? 
 Point being, I know these people. 
 Let me do the talking. 
 Ugh, racist. 
 Verlaine :  Mrs. Evans? 
 We can monitor you and your family right here in your home. 
 You don't have to wait on long lines in the ER or at the HMO. 
 You don't have to miss work, and your kids don't have to miss school. 
 Where does this thing go? 
 That goes on your ankle. 
 Oh, so you've got us on house arrest. 
 Sorry, we're not going to let you experiment on our kids. 
 Mr. Evans, I get where you're coming from. 
 But if you give us a shot... 
 (coughing) 
 (continues coughing) 
 You know, that sounds pretty bad. 
 Now, does he sound like that a lot? 
 It comes and goes. He has asthma. 
 Mrs. Evans, if you give us a chance, I think we can help your son. 
 (coughing) 
 (water flowing in stream) 
 That's Maharishi Makkar. 
 James gave him a six-month residency here. 
 I haven't introduced myself. uh... 
 Doc... Dr. Channarayapatra. 
 Out of Johns Hopkins, neurosurgery. 
 I like to keep tabs on the best and the brightest. 
 Coming from you, Dr. Wallace, I am flattered. (chuckles) 
 So do you think it's possible, what James is trying to do? 
 What you're all trying to do? 
 I'd like to think there's a place that can actually innovate, but... 
 I can't quite believe it. 
 About 90% of the time that I'm here, I think this can never work. 
 But that leaves a ten percent chance that we're actually gonna be able to do something. 
 Be a beacon for change. 
 And I think that's ten percent more of a chance than I have at any other hospital. 
 (Margo screams) 
 (screaming) 
 Mrs. Byer? 
 Margo! 
 Crawling all over me! 
 Margo, Margo, Margo, it's Dr. Wallace. I'm here to help you. 
 Listen to me. Mrs. Byer. 
 Help me! 
 Mrs. Byer, okay, come on. 
 Get off me! 
 Brockett : This is the view from the ingestible. 
 Margo, your fetus is unharmed. 
 Oh, thank God. And can the baby survive on her own yet? 
 She is getting stronger, but... no, not yet. 
 Wallace : Margo, when you were in the pond, what exactly was happening? 
 There were bugs all over me. 
 Hmm. 
 All over my baby. 
 So were there... actually bugs? 
 No, no, they were in my imagination. 
 Has anything like this ever happened to you before? 
 A few times. 
 Yeah. 
 Margo, is there any... history of mental illness in your family? 
 No. 
 Why? Does that have something to do with why I'm sick? 
 No. 
 Why are you getting her upset? 
 This is not that big an issue. She'll be fine. 
 She's always been fine. Now, can we please focus on delivering this child and saving my wife's life? 
 Soul :  Hi, Krissy. 
 We can't wait for you to wake up so you can see what all your friends and family have written to you, how much everyone loves you. 
 We're all waiting for you to wake up so we can celebrate with you. 
 Happy birthday. 
 Love you. 
 James? 
 Hmm? 
 I need to talk to you about something. 
 Not a patient. 
 It's about us. 
 O... kay. 
 In the future, please don't contradict my medical opinion in front of a patient like you did with Margo the other day. 
 You shouldn't do that with any doctor, but with me, because... I look young, patients tend to forget that I'm a doctor, and... 
 (sighs) I work really hard to make them not forget that, so... please don't undermine me that way in the future. 
 Gotcha. 
 Anything else? 
 Well, uh... 
 I would also appreciate it if you would refrain from calling me the "reality police" in our staff meetings. 
 (chuckling): Yeah. 
 Another term for reality police is "good doctor." 
 Maybe you could use that one instead. 
 And? 
 And Anabel isn't Anabel, all right? 
 Okay. 
 She's Angie. James, she's  Angie.  Every time you call her her Anabel, you're hurting her feelings. 
 I will try to remember her name, and I will try not to... undermine you. 
 Oh, great. 
 Thank you. 
 Welcome. 
 That's all. 
 Great. 
 Mm-hmm. 
 ♪ ♪ 
 
 
 
 Please don't do that. 
 You're tense. 
 Yeah. That's making me tenser. 
 Yeah. 
 I'm gonna set up an appointment with you and the maharishi. 
 Margo's delusions, Mm. 
 It's called formication. 
 Dr. Wallace, I'm calling HR. 
 Formication, 
 Mm-hmm. With an M. 
 Sometimes caused by stress, mental illness. 
 My instinct is it has something to do with Margo's illness, but I can't quite figure out what, exactly. 
 And why would Paul and Margo never tell anyone about it? 
 Makes no sense. I... think I can help you with all this. 
 (clears throat) 
 This system can compare... 
 Margo's medical records with millions of other patient profiles and predict the probability of likely underlying pathology. 
 And it can do it in seconds. 
 Domestic abuse? 
 Hmm. 
 The past six years, one doctor noted her being disassociated from her emotions, two found her depressed, and another diagnosed her with irritable bowel syndrome. 
 Then in 2013, there was a trip and fall where she broke her jaw. How many people fall and break their jaw? 
 If this is true, your program reached that diagnosis months before I would have. 
 Put it up here, W, come on. 
 Come to papa. Right there. Let's see if this is right first. 
 (chuckles softly) 
 (alarm sounding) 
 Uh, it's Margo. 
 (groaning) 
 (grunting in pain) 
 Five liters 02, non rebreather. 
 Lorazepam, four milligrams, right now. 
 No, no, no. 
 No, that can affect the baby. You're not gonna put anything in my wife's body that can affect the baby. 
 We're trying to save your wife's life. 
 Doing nothing's not an option. 
 No, you're not giving her drugs. 
 (grunts) Aah! 
 Damn it, I will not allow you! 
 (grunts) 
 Take him out of here. 
 No! 
 Brockett : She's moving too much to inject her. 
 Move her back. Hold her head. 
 Aah! 
 Sto... 
 Ugh... 
 (panting) 
 (moaning) 
 Keep him away from her. 
 Doctor's orders. 
 Okay. 
 Wallace : Margo? 
 Hmm? 
 Margo? 
 Hmm? 
 Am I okay? 
 Yes. 
 Is my baby okay? 
 She's fine. 
 Where's Paul? 
 I asked them to keep him away for awhile. 
 What? Why? 
 Margo, you have a medical history that strongly suggests domestic abuse. 
 I... s... I-I don't know what you're talking about. 
 I don't know if that's what is happening, but I want you to know that no one should ever have to live like that. 
 And now there are two of you. 
 (sighs heavily) 
 I love Paul. 
 (sighs) 
 He loves me, he-he does. 
 He doesn't mean it. 
 He always feels so bad afterwards. 
 (crying): He does love me, he really does. 
 (cries) 
 This is Evelyn. 
 She's a 46-year-old Hispanic female in Houston with transient global amnesia who has repeated, unexplained, short-term memory loss. 
 MRI shows no neurological disease or structural abnormalities. 
 What do we think? 
 If we can find the trigger, we can reflect that back to the general population and help other cases like it. 
 Brockett : Yeah, I agree. 
 Bunker Hill material all the way. 
 Bell : Okay, arrange the transfer. 
 You got it. 
 Anyone else before we break it off? 
 Anabel, remind me, what was that case you brought up the other day? 
 You mean the one you asked me to look up for you? 
 Nope, your case, you're fine. 
 No false modesty. 
 Oh, uh, okay. 
 Well, I... well, it's-it's pretty esoteric. 
 I really doubt it's for us. 
 Why don't we let the team decide? 
 Okay. Sure, great. 
 Uh... this is Louis Keating. 
 Lives in Chicago. 
 Male, 42 years old. 
 He's been diagnosed with GSS, Gerstmann-Straussler-Scheinker disease. 
 Bell : It's a neurological disease. It's like ALS on steroids. 
 It's fascinating. 
 And also extremely rare. 
 200 cases worldwide. 
 Yeah, I have to agree, this case is extremely esoteric. 
 Okay, thank you, man who doesn't even work here. 
 Strauss : It's true, James. 
 I think this patient's better off in long term care. 
 Guys, I agree, it's rare, but maybe it'll be a gateway to treatment for more common neurological diseases, like Alzheimer's. 
 This is a fascinating disease. 
 I want this patient. 
 Nice find, Anabel. 
 Bring him in. 
 Do you know what Margo told the police? 
 Is she definitely planning to press charges? 
 Yes. 
 Good. 
 So, the domestic abuse diagnosis was correct. 
 Guess it's not just all gizmos and gadgets. 
 James, the... 
 Yeah? 
 ...GSS case you're transferring here, it seemed, uh... so random, um, too random. 
 So, I looked into it and I discovered that there's only been one case of GSS in the Bay Area in the last 50 years. 
 Her name was Lynn Underhill. 
 She had a child she gave up for adoption, August 28, 1985. 
 Your birthday. 
 Is it you, James? 
 No. 
 You see a lot of billionaires become philanthropists, but you never see them follow it up with an 80-hour work week. 
 Uh, so, if I'm gonna even think about uprooting my life to come here, I need to know why you're here, why we're all here. 
 Are we here to save the world? 
 Or are we all here to save James Bell? 
 (scoffs) 
 You did a bad data search, Dr. Wallace. 
 You're wrong. 
 Better stick to medicine. 
 (indistinct conversation) 
 (alarm beeping) 
 I know this kid. 
 Get the paramedics there now. 
 Response time for that neighborhood right now is 20 minutes. 
 I'm heading over. 
 Hey. 
 Where's Jeffrey? 
 How's he doing? 
 Wait, how is that possible? 
 His lung capacity showed a severe drop. 
 That's the lung capacity of Freddie, not Jeffrey. 
 Who-Who's Freddie? 
 (dog barks) 
 Uh, Jeffrey put the sensor on the dog and we had no idea. 
 I'm sorry about this. 
 Look, I like what you're trying to do here, but I don't know how much longer I can keep taking these calls. 
 Maybe it's better just do things the old fashioned way: you feel sick, you go see a doctor. 
 "When going on a hunt, the mother cheetah will leave her cubs alone and vulnerable for days at a time." 
 Hmm. 
 "If she returns to find her den empty, she will search relentlessly, calling out and listening for their cries. But with every passing day, hope dwindles." 
 (sighs) 
 Margo, we're gonna get you medicine to help you feel better. 
 (sighs) 
 Am I gonna die? 
 Margo, you need to listen to me. 
 Okay? 
 The reason you're having trouble breathing is your tumor is now choking your heart. 
 We need to operate... now. 
 What-what about my baby? 
 Your baby can't survive on her own yet. 
 Margo, this is your decision. 
 I'll do whatever you want. 
 But we've run out of time. 
 Doctor, someday I hope that I can forget everything about my husband, everything he ever did to me. 
 (sighs) 
 But this is still my child. 
 Right now I feel like she's my reason. 
 (whispering): She's my reason for being alive. 
 S-So, I'm asking you... 
 ...how long can I wait before we have to do this surgery? 
 I have a team set and ready to go first thing in the morning. 
 What if we waited 24 hours? 
 Can my girl survive? 
 Possibly. 
 Then I want to wait. 
 (softly): Please. 
 Okay. 
 Ay, everybody, just stop what you're doing for a second and just gather round. 
 I got something to say. 
 Krissy Ramirez, our young coma patient, she's been with us for six months. 
 We've been trying to get her to come out to us. 
 I've decided we're gonna stop trying to get her to come to us. 
 We're gonna go to her. 
 She can't speak; she can't move; she can't open her eyes, so we have to bypass all of that, go right to the cerebral cortex. 
 And I thought, "Well, that's impossible." 
 And then I went online and I found this. 
 Check this out. This is real. 
 Brain to brain communication. 
 Somebody actually invented a version of the Vulcan mind meld. 
 Okay, this dude here, the guy on the left in the crazy helmet, sent three words to this guy  on the right, in the crazy helmet,  using only his thoughts. 
 Cheng : Amazing. 
 But it says here they've only had two successful tests, that this kind of technology won't be available to the masses for another decade. 
 Do I look like the masses? 
 Come on. 
 I just called these guys. 
 Guess what? They needed funding. 
 We now own this. 
 (crowd chuckles and gasps) 
 We're gonna use it to find out, unequivocally, whether Krissy is still Krissy. 
 Because then we know whether there's someone still there to save. 
 Let's go get Krissy. 
 Woman : Yeah, wow. 
 Man : Terrific. 
 Dr. Verlaine. 
 It's your kid again. 
 It's showing cardiac arrhythmia. 
 Get them on the phone now. 
 Look at that ST elevation. 
 Mrs. Evans : Hello? 
 Mrs. Evans, this is Malik from Bunker Hill. 
 Has Jeffrey done something with his sensor again? 
 He doesn't have the sensor. 
 What? 
 We gave it back to the paramedic yesterday. 
 (phone ringing) 
 Yes? 
 Sergeant Dawson, this is Dr. Verlaine, you might be having a heart attack. I need you to get to the ER right now. 
 What? 
 How would you know this? 
 Look in your pocket. 
 Good news, Sergeant. 
 Your troponin is positive, meaning you did have a cardiac event, but we caught it early. 
 You're stabilized. 
 So you're telling me I had a heart attack? 
 Yes. I thought I had indigestion. 
 I was gonna go home and sleep it off. 
 And you could've had a fatal arrhythmia in your sleep. 
 So this idiotic thing might've just saved my life. 
 That's the idea, Sergeant. 
 You okay? 
 New scan of Margot's heart. 
 Mm. 
 It's worse. 
 I don't know if I can do it. 
 You're the best there is. 
 You'll nail it. 
 This isn't programming a computer. 
 There's only one way to remove the tumor, and a million ways it could go wrong. 
 If my scalpel misses by a millimeter, I could puncture her heart, and we've lost Margot and the baby. 
 What if I could give you a million chances to get it right?

 Brockett : This mass is a tumor, and that tangle right there is matted to the ascending aorta. 
 Gnarly.

 Bell : So, Maria, the idea is we're gonna try to communicate with Krissy with your thoughts, and wake up her brain. 
 Brockett : And we'll be able to monitor her brain activity in real time through the EEG. 
 The more she hears you, the more active her brain will become. 
 Bell : And if you reach her, maybe she'll be able to communicate back to you, let us know she's there. 
 You ready? 
 Yes. 
 Okay. 
 I want you to focus your thoughts on the images that come up on the wall. 
 Let's take Krissy to Africa.

 Consciousness. 
 Bell : Soul, it's time. 
 Talk to your daughter. 
 Let's see if she can communicate back to us.

 It's Dad.

 Margot's in recovery. 
 Okay.

 The trial period is up, so... 
 I need to know whether you're gonna take the job. 
 I've come to a decision. 
 But before you tell me, I should tell you... um... 
 I did have the genetic test done, and it came back positive... for GSS. 
 Um, so at some point probably over the next five years my hands will start to shake, and my speech will slow. 
 Uh, and then I'll develop tics, and... until finally, the man that everybody calls a genius, won't be able to remember his own name. 
 (inhales deeply) Ooh... 
 I built the hospital for all the wrong reasons, but, um... 
 ...does that really matter? 
 I'm so sorry, James. 
 Eh, it's... 
 You're the only one who knows.

 Yeah.
