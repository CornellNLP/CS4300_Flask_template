 Want some breakfast? 
 No, I'm good. 
 I talked to your aunt. 
 She said it's fine. 
 We got a room for you and everything. 
 When's this happening? 
 She'll be here tomorrow night. 
 It's not quick enough. 
 She's taking the day off from work and driving here from Pittsburgh. 
 That's as soon as she can do it. 
 Something going on I should know about? 
 Trayzell said I got to do a hit. 
 When? 
 I don't know. 
 He said to just be ready. 
 I gotta reprove myself to him. 
 Okay. 
 You're staying with me now. I'll take you to my place. 
 I don't need a place to crash. 
 I need to get out. 
 You said you'd do that for me. 
 And I will. 
 I'm trusting you, man. 
 Diego going back to school today? 
 Let's give him till Monday. 
 [Cell phone chimes] 
 It's not like he hasn't been through a lot. 
 It's one of my CIs. 
 Jasmine? 
 Yeah. 
 She calls a lot. 
 She's a good CI. 
 I want to meet her. 
 Now, there's a fun time. 
 My wife and my hooker CI? 
 I just want to, you know, have her over for dinner. 
 Babe, I could be fired for having her here. 
 We'll meet her on neutral ground. 
 We'll take her out for dinner. 
 Nah. 
 Is there a reason you don't... you don't want me to meet her, Antonio? 
 Baby, there's no need for you to feel threatened by the skank, junkie, hooker CI who I deal with because it's part of my job. 
 Then we will meet her for dinner. 
 [Sighs] 
 Hey listen, I got this thing on Friday night, but I can blow it off if you think... what kind of thing? 
 It's my engagement party. 
 Where's my invite? 
 Ha. 
 Seriously? You know, that's all I need. 
 "Hey, sweetie, this is my partner, the married one who lives in his garage. 
 Don't worry, that's not gonna happen to us." 
 No offense, though, I don't want you anywhere near her. 
 Does that mean you set a date? 
 Ah, today's the 21st, so 6 months today. 
 Oh, man, today's the 21st. 
 Yeah, it usually follows the 20th. 
 What's up? 
 Nothing. 
 All right, there are two unrelated wire investigations. 
 Surveillance followed three of area central's top-ranking gang targets to this house on Carpenter. 
 Narcotics hasn't gotten anywhere with it, so command staff wants Intelligence on it. 
 Roll out in five. 
 Hey, hey, what are ya doing? 
 I need a desk. 
 Not that one. 
 That was Willhite's desk. 
 I'll let everybody know when someone can use it. 
 Yeah. 
 We got the main eye. 
 [Walkie-talkie beeps] 
 We're set up to the north. 
 10-4. 
 We got the south and a partial of the alley. 
 If anyone goes mobile from the house, we're in position for a take-away. 
 O and Ruzek, move closer. 
 See if there's any movement in the house. 
 10-4. 
 [Shutter clicks] 
 Hold up. We got company. 
 Who's this joker? 
 [Knocks on door] 
 Gun! 
 [Gunfire] 
 [Gunshots] 
 Stay down! 
 [Groaning] 
 Clear! 
 Police! 
 Clear! 
 Hoodie's dead. 
 This one's alive. 
 Charlie 50-21, emergency. 
 What? 
 He's gonna bleed out. 
 We gotta put pressure on the wound. 
 One shot fired by the police. 
 Offender down. Plainclothes officers on scene. 
 In here! 
 Cop killers. 
 Hey, look at this. 
 What do you got? 
 Insulin. 
 Somebody was a diabetic? 
 Or not. 
 Is there a black market for this stuff? 
 None that I've heard of. 
 But you know what? 
 It's a good place to hide a bullet, though. 
 Nice work. 
 Hey, Sarge. 
 You got a Calhoun county sheriff? 
 No, that's a beauty. 
 Yeah, my cousin's dating a guy that works dispatch in Corpus Christi. 
 Well, you tell your cousin a "thank you" from me. 
 What about the one I gave you? 
 Walla Walla? 
 Yeah, I traded that one. 
 Nice work. 
 Thank you. 
 My friends are coming into town. 
 I want to give them the grand tour. 
 I'd rather not have Platt deep-sixing it. 
 Did you see a counselor? 
 Counselor? 
 I don't need to see a counselor. 
 Well, I don't need to wear pants, but, you know, here I am. 
 It's compulsory. 
 Yeah, and I'll pick up something for dinner. 
 All right. 
 No, end of discussion. 
 This is Edward Jelko, the deceased street-level dealer. 
 This is Peter Thomas Banfill, the offender, currently baking in a coma over at County. 
 Jelko probably thought like we did that Banfill was sitting on something big, went over there to rip him off. 
 These are M995s, teflon-tipped, kevlar-penetrating rounds. 
 Ballistics has 'em linked to several recent homicides. 
 And we found 100 of these at the scene. 
 It's for type R insulin, which is a Canadian designation. 
 And with any luck, our little surprise visit got the gun runners scrambling, which means they're gonna make mistakes, okay? 
 Eyes open. 
 Erin, come here a second, will you? 
 [Sighs] 
 Do you want the door closed? 
 Assume I always want it closed. 
 Okay, tough guy. 
 Justin's getting early release. 
 He's moved up to Friday night. 
 That's great. 
 Well, he's asking if you can be there. 
 It's no big deal if you can't. 
 Are you crazy? Of course it's a big deal. 
 He's getting out. 
 Yeah. 
 What? 
 Why do you look like somebody just pissed in your coffee? 
 Gettin' out is always harder than gettin' in. 
 Hank. 
 Come on. 
 Justin's gonna need you around, okay? 
 The tough love thing, it... it didn't work. 
 Do me a favor. 
 Tell Antonio I'll be back in an hour, okay? 
 Yeah. 
 You hear anyone talking about cop-killer bullets out on the street? 
 No. I can ask around. 
 Would you? 
 That's it? 
 How about next time, you text me so I don't have to drive a half hour in traffic? 
 I was wondering if you want to grab dinner. 
 You and me? Like a date? 
 Yes or no? 
 When? 
 Tomorrow night, 7:00. 
 I already have a dinner. 
 Cancel it. 
 Unless you want to pay me 400 bucks for lost wages, I'm gonna have to take a rain check. 
 [Chuckles] 
 Hey! 
 I found the source of the Insulin. 
 A company near Toronto named "Markham Medical Supply," their sales rep makes a run here every other Thursday. 
 He left at 5:00 this morning. 
 I'm guessing they have tracking numbers on all their products? 
 Yep. 
 All right, get those tracking numbers, locate him on GP, and... you already did that. 
 Yep, Atwater and Burgess are en route tracking the signal. 
 Nice. 
 Do me one favor: Do not give me one of those open-fingered explosion hands that people do. 
 I hate that. 
 If it's your thing, I'd rather high five. 
 Never again. 
 Hey. 
 Hey, Halstead. 
 Any word on Banfill? 
 He's still in the ICU. 
 You seen the counselor yet? 
 Yeah, this afternoon. 
 You know, I'm gonna send out a memo so people can stop asking me. 
 Whoa, whoa, whoa. 
 Who do you think you're talking to? 
 You got 10 minutes on this job. 
 It's... a lot of people have been asking me. 
 Say that next time. 
 No, you're right. You're right. 
 I got it.  
 Okay. 
 All right. 
 Detective Voight. 
 Actually, it's Sergeant now. 
 How do you know me? 
 Casper. 
 Oh, yeah, Casper. 
 He's with the Vice Lords. 
 I heard he's in Marion now. 
 Yeah, didn't work out too well for him. 
 I mean, it worked out good for you, though. 
 Look, I know who you are and what you're about. 
 But you are legit now, right? 
 [Snickers] 
 I need to talk to you alone. 
 No, you can speak to me right here. 
 D'Anthony. 
 I want him out. 
 Get-out-of-jail-free card for you in return. 
 So you want Little D, huh? 
 [Chuckles] 
 You into that? 
 [Laughter] 
 Did I come here disrespecting you? 
 You know I put a lot of money and time into that boy, right? 
 See, you may want to give me some paper as opposed to some damn business card. 
 Give me 10 grand, and he's yours. 
 I'll be in touch. 
 Yeah, right on Morgan. 
 Hey, do you think you could hook me up with a car? 
 Mm, I don't know. 
 There's such thing as lead time, that kind of stuff. 
 I know, it's just kind of a big deal. 
 It's my flight attendant friends, and I was kind of... 
 Hold up, flight attendants? 
 You never said nothing about flight attendants. 
 Yeah, three girls I flew with when I was... 
 Well, yeah. Well... psh, I'll get you a car. 
 Should of said that upfront. 
 I'll get you a good car. 
 This is it. 
 Nobody's delivering medical supplies here. 
 Police! Show me your hands! 
 This is definitely our sales rep. 
 George Wilenko, 41. 
 He's been with Markham Medical for 17 years. 
 No record, fully bonded, has border clearance. 
 This guy's not your typical smuggler. 
 You notice the cup? 
 Lipstick on the lid. 
 These are what we're looking for. 
 C7s, a variant used by the Canadian army. 
 An armory up there was robbed. 
 3,000 rounds of ammo and 50 C7s were stolen. 
 Bigger market for sprayers down here. 
 Victim's wife drove down with him. 
 Halstead and Lindsay are bringing her in. 
 Good. 
 Hey. 
 You're working that Kelly Severide thing over at Firehouse 51? 
 Yeah, during the blackout, he got mixed up with that knucklehead Vince Keeler? 
 Yeah, I know Keeler. He's bad news. 
 Which is exactly what I told Severide and why he needs to stay away from that guy. 
 Severide's sister Katie was reported missing. 
 How long? 
 16 hours. 
 She's an adult, really nothing we can do until it's 24, but she is a fireman's sister, basically one of our own, so area central's already got a task force on it. 
 They said they'd call if they need us. 
 So meantime, we got our own case to work, okay? 
 Absolutely. 
 Don't arrest us, Officer. 
 Hey! 
 Oh, my... look who made it to Chicago. 
 Hi. How are you? 
 Hi. 
 Oh, my God, come on, I'll give you the grand tour. 
 Yeah, let's go. 
 Kevin Atwater. 
 Yes, Hailey, Genevieve, Vera, this is my partner. 
 I look out for her. 
 I'll bet you do. 
 Oh. 
 Spicy. 
 This is it. 
 It's awesome. 
 Hey, Sarge. 
 What's going on here? 
 Ladies, this is our desk Sergeant, Trudy Platt. 
 Hello. 
 All : Hi. 
 This is her district, and she runs it firmly but fairly. 
 Nothing gets by this woman. 
 So if you guys will follow me. 
 Including you. 
 I just wanted... 
 Drunk and disorderly at Duffy's Tavern. 
 That's half the clientele at Duffy's. 
 Well, that's good then, you've narrowed down the list of suspects. 
 Hey, Tommy, cover me. 
 Good afternoon, ladies. What's up? 
 You want a tour of District 21? 
 I'd be delighted. 
 Has anybody here heard of Al Capone? 
 He was here? 
 Everybody was here. 
 Let's go. 
 To be perfectly honest, doc, I'm pretty thrilled with the way that it went down. 
 You give me a him-or-me choice, I'm gonna make it the same way every time. 
 People can feel conflicted about something, even if it is justified. 
 Well, I'm not, doc. 
 I'm not. 
 What? 
 Conflicted. 
 You are not married. 
 Are you in a relationship? 
 Are you asking me out, doc? 
 I have a girlfriend. 
 She's my fiancée as of about a month ago. 
 How does she feel about what you've been through? 
 I haven't told her. 
 Most of us at one time or another meet challenges that we can't explain. 
 Just... [Sighs] 
 Are you trying to make me feel bad? 
 Is that what you want to hear? 
 Not at all. 
 Okay, are we done? 
 I would like for you to take the rest of the shift off. 
 My mother always called it "Murder City." 
 [Sighs] 
 [Sniffles] 
 But the first time we visited, I fell in love with Chicago. 
 The lake, the river walk. 
 George and I went to the top of the Willis tower. 
 God, I just... I can't believe it. 
 Why would someone kill my husband? 
 We think that he was smuggling guns into the country. 
 George? 
 He wasn't killed over Insulin. 
 And on his last trip here, we think his vehicle was filled with these. 
 I'm hallucinating. This isn't happening. 
 Five people have already been killed by them. 
 Look, you don't get it. George would never do that ever. 
 How often did you make the trip down with him? 
 Every couple of months. 
 We always stay at the Sofitel. 
 I shop. That's why he dropped me off. 
 They don't have Bloomingdale's in Canada. 
 What do you say, Maurice? 
 It's all good. 
 You hear anything about lone guns coming in to town? 
 What kind? 
 Sprayers. A lot of 'em. 
 Heard about something from Canada. 
 That doesn't make a lot of sense. 
 It's starting to. 
 You hear anything, hit me up. 
 Another thing. 
 I've been getting some static from this cat named Trayzell with the GDs. 
 You know anybody got his ear? 
 Trayzell's? 
 Mm. 
 No. 
 He's stone crazy. 
 He don't listen to nobody. 
 And I need to bring you in on something. 
 State's Attorney's getting someone to flip on me, buildin' a case or somethin'. 
 I haven't got wind of anything. 
 Now you have. 
 Five stacks. 
 More when you get me that name. 
 I got you. 
 Go for Voight. 
 We got somethin'. 
 These are our bullets. 
 Can you believe the velocity of these things? 
 Forensics traced one round that went through the TV, through the wall, ended up halfway through the engine block of an ice cream truck parked across the street. 
 Seven homicides and counting. 
 Our widow's lying. 
 Her cell phone provider said she was never at Bloomingdale's. 
 She spent the afternoon up in Edgewater. 
 We're gonna get real honest real quick. 
 Do you recognize these men? 
 Oh, God. 
 Yeah, neither can we. 
 His face was shot off by the bullets you and your husband brought into Chicago. 
 Why are you doing this? 
 You lied to us. 
 You weren't browsing Bloomingdale's. 
 You were in Edgewater. 
 You and your husband had a nice run, right? 
 You start off with something simple like x or kush, and you got greedy, and you upgraded to gun-running. 
 You got George killed, which makes you an accessory to his murder. 
 So we're gonna try this again, only this time the truth. 
 I was visiting a friend. 
 An ex-boyfriend. 
 If you're gonna lie, put some effort into it for me. 
 Call him. He'll tell you. 
 Name, number. 
 [Door closes] 
 
 
 
 I want you to take me through your entire day, every stop you made, every person you talked to, everything you did. 
 I already told you. 
 Tell me again. 
 [Sighs] 
 We were on the road by 4:30. 
 Didn't stop till we crossed the border just past Ann Arbor. 
 Got some coffee, some gas. Used the washroom. 
 George got a phone call from our nephew... 
 Who's the nephew? 
 He lives here. 
 He likes to meet up with George... 
 Oh, God, Mikey doesn't know. 
 Does Mikey have a last name? 
 Michael Ganz, lives in East Garfield Park, has a record: robbery, possession. 
 Runs with a small crew. 
 Claire's ex-boyfriend checks out right down to the 500 bucks. 
 Got a ping on Ganz's phone, pulled all the numbers he's called in the last 24 hours. 
 [Applauds] Employee of the week, Jin, right here. 
 All the calls were to the same numbers, a cell phone registered to a Lucky M Pawn and Loan in Gage Park. 
 Lucky M. 
 I know that ding-dong. 
 We'll go talk to him. Come on. 
 Hey, O. 
 Yeah. 
 I'm gonna need you later off the books. 
 Yeah. 
 Let's go. 
 Come on. 
 Mr. Milner. 
 Alvin. 
 Hey. So how's the usury business? 
 [Chuckles] 
 I don't run that kind of operation. 
 Good for you. 
 So, um, guns coming in from Canada. 
 I just introduce people. 
 [Laughs] 
 Wha... wha... what does that mean? 
 Nothin'. I'm just telling you, you know? 
 No, I don't know. 
 I don't know anything about Canadian guns. 
 Then why did you say, "I just introduce people"? 
 It just seems odd. 
 You make me nervous. 
 Why? Huh? 
 Why? 
 Yeah. 
 How about the last time you were in my shop, huh? 
 You took a nine iron to my jewelry case. 
 That was here? 
 Alvin. 
 I don't know anything, okay? 
 Let me, uh... let me see that. 
 Right there, right there. Right... right over there, yeah. 
 He set up a buy with Ganz tomorrow, 2:00 P.M. 
 [Knocking on door] 
 Hey, Danny. 
 Hi, Jay. 
 Pastrami for Danny, and smoked turkey for you. 
 Oh, gosh. 
 We're going to be eating this till Thanksgiving. 
 Hey, let me get you a sandwich. 
 No, I can't. I gotta run. 
 Oh, come on, let me at least give you a slice of cake to go. 
 [Sighs] 
 This is always a tough day for him. 
 He won't eat it. 
 I just end up throwing it out. 
 Small slice. 
 Can I see your driver's license? 
 Halstead. Intelligence. 
 This is harassment. 
 Just eating some birthday cake. 
 Today would have been a birthday. 
 Arrest him. 
 Get him out of here! 
 Sorry, pal. 
 All you dirty bastards stick together. 
 You always have. 
 Seven years ago today, Lonnie. 
 Today. 
 Get outta here! 
 Seven years! 
 He would have been 15! 
 I'm gonna call my lawyer. I'm getting a restraining order. 
 I'm gonna give you a reason to need one one day. 
 Oh, God. 
 You and your sick-ass son. 
 Okay. I got nothin' on the guns. 
 Sorry. 
 That's it? 
 Next time, text me. 
 And also, my date canceled for tomorrow, so you're on. 
 What do you want me to wear? 
 Dress conservative. 
 Repeat that back to me. 
 I will dress conservative. 
 Ciao Amore at 7:00. 
 Okay. 
 See you then. 
 [Knocks on door] 
 Severide. 
 Hey. 
 Hey, um, I didn't know where else to go, and, um, and I don't... no one's heard anything. 
 I don't know what to do. 
 Hey, we're gonna find her, okay? 
 Yeah. 
 I promise. 
 We've got really good guys on this. 
 And I know it's scary, and I know your sister's alone, but we're gonna find her. 
 [Cries] 
 [Moaning] 
 Come on. 
 [Moaning] 
 Hey, Trayzell. 
 [Screams] 
 Bro. 
 [Moans] 
 I came to you man to man, tried to do business. 
 You want to negotiate? 
 Maybe Casper didn't tell you before he got sent up, but I don't like negotiating. 
 Maybe he didn't tell you, I make offers once. 
 [Screams] 
 [Groans] 
 You can uncuff him. 
 [Groans] 
 Ah! 
 Ooh. 
 [Groans] 
 Look at me. 
 D'Anthony is out as of this minute. 
 You look sideways at him, you're goin' on a ride you're never coming back from. 
 You understand? 
 All right. 
 Let's get outta here. 
 [Groans] 
 Let's keep our heads down. 
 Assume Mike is packing heavy stuff. 
 Hey. 
 Look at you all fresh like a daisy. 
 Yeah, what a wank. 
 Hey, listen, any word on the guy I dropped? 
 Nah, still in the ICU. 
 All right. 
 Hey, what'd your counselor say? 
 Oh, that I'm coping well with the trauma, but I think she was talking about working with you. 
 You're in the van. 
 Wait, why can't I do the buy with you? 
 'Cause Antonio called shotgun before you did. 
 You gotta be... Al, how long is this gonna go on for? I'm fine. 
 Christmas. 
 What? 
 Christmas is the takedown word. 
 Hey. 
 Reservation's all set at Carmine's for when he's out. 
 They gave us the back room, so who do you want me to invite? 
 Oh, let's keep it small, just the three of us. 
 Yeah? 
 I don't think he should be around his old friends just yet. 
 Okay. 
 That's our boy, Ganz. 
 Milner says you're huntin' for hardware? 
 If they're the quality Milner said they are, we'll take most of 'em off your hands. 
 I'll take you to it. 
 Get in. 
 Aw, come on. 
 Only one of you with the money. 
 Forget it. 
 Fine with me. 
 Hey, hey... whoa, whoa, whoa, wait... wait a sec. 
 Wait... wait... wait a sec. 
 Okay. 
 No. 
 All right. 
 He's a cupcake. 
 [Engine starts] 
 We're goin' mobile. 
 What's your name? 
 What do you care? 
 We're heading north. 
 Heard you had a... a crew. 
 Well, you'll meet 'em soon enough. 
 What's wrong? 
 We've lost his audio and his tracking beacon. 
 We're headin' into McCook. 
 Why do you keep calling out directions? 
 I'm in a car with some guy I never met. 
 You know, he's taking me to an undisclosed location. 
 You know, I'm just thinkin' out loud. 
 Pull over. 
 Give me your phone. 
 I'm not wired. 
 Do it. 
 Open the door, and you die. 
 This is so, so dumb. 
 Okay. 
 I want you to look at the mile marker and make a note. 
 Why's that? 
 Once the deal is done, you're gonna bring me back here so I can look for that phone. 
 How closely can you track him, Jin? 
 Six meters. 
 Yards, whatever. 
 Let's see the money. 
 25 large. 
 I left the other half with my associate. 
 You really think I'll come alone with all the cash? 
 Well, let's see the damn guns. 
 Ooh. 
 Look at that. 
 It's just like Christmas morning. 
 [Loud crash] Cops. 
 Police! 
 [Gunfire] 
 Move! 
 [Gunfire] 
 [Gunfire] 
 Put the gun down! 
 I will drop you, I swear to God. 
 Put it down. 
 Get on the ground. Put your palms in the air. 
 Get down. 
 O? 
 [Sirens wailing] 
 Burgess, Atwater, you got two white male offenders moving southwest of the building towards you. 
 You all right? 
 Yeah. 
 Hey. 
 The radio was in my belt buckle, slick. 
 See? 
 Just so when you're in gen pop telling your story, you get your details straight. 
 Hey. 
 Well, that got crazy fast. 
 Didn't I tell you he was a cupcake? 
 [Cell phone vibrates] 
 [Indistinct chatter] 
 Aw... 
 I gotta take care of something. 
 Don't say that. 
 Tell Justin something popped up. 
 Are you kidding me? 
 Just do this for me, okay? 
 Thank you. 
 No. 
 You're telling me that whatever you have going on is more important than seeing your only son walk out of the gates? 
 Yes. 
 Tell Justin I love him and I'll see him tomorrow. 
 That's your third. 
 Still one short of getting me through this evening. 
 Jasmine. 
 What the hell? 
 My wife wanted to meet you. 
 So why didn't you say something? 
 You would never have come. 
 You're right. 
 Jasmine, Laura. Laura, Jasmine. 
 Hi. It's... it's nice to finally meet you. 
 Look Mrs. Dawson, I get it, okay? 
 Nobody wants their husband to hang out with someone like... like me, but you know what? 
 Let me tell you something, okay? 
 I got no designs on him, and he's got none on me, so if we're done with this little face-to-face... 
 Wait. Just wait. 
 I wanted to give you this. 
 It's, uh, it's St. Nicholas, the patron Saint of children. 
 You helped save our son's life. 
 I just wanted to thank you personally. 
 Why didn't you tell me this is why you wanted to see her? 
 'Cause you wouldn't have brought her. 
 Nobody's wife has ever thanked me before. 
 Come on. 
 Sit down. 
 [Laughter] Good evening, ladies. 
 Oh. 
 You take one photo and post this on Facebook, I will destroy you. 
 Copy that. 
 Good. 
 All right, let's do this. [Cheering] 
 [Laughs] Have a good night. 
 Pop! 
 [Indistinct chatter] 
 Hi. 
 All right, well, I appreciate the phone call. 
 [Clears throat] 
 Hey, baby. 
 Who's on the phone? 
 Uh, that was, um... 
 Adam. 
 All right, look, listen, I wanted to bring you in on somethin', okay? 
 Okay. 
 Okay. 
 Um, they didn't pull me out of the academy to do paperwork. 
 They pulled me out to work in Intelligence. 
 I'm sorry. 
 It's a good thing, isn't it? 
 Yeah, like you wouldn't believe. 
 It's awesome. 
 There's guys with 10 years on the job that are still trying to give their left nut to be in this unit. 
 Well, what was the phone call? 
 I was in a shooting yesterday. 
 What? 
 It's all right. 
 Oh my God, what happened? 
 Well, the guy that I shot who was trying to kill me, he died, and that was the hospital. 
 Are you messin' with me right now? 
 No. I'm not messing with you. 
 I just wanted to tell you in case I'm a little distracted tonight, which I won't be because I'm totally fine, okay? 
 Hey, look at me. 
 I'm fine. It's all fine. 
 Now, come make me look pretty. 
 Let's go mingle. 
 Adam. 
 How can you be fine? 
 I don't know. I just am. 
 All right. 
 Well, listen, I need a drink. 
 Freedom! 
 [Laughs] 
 Whoo. 
 Gentlemen, it's been nice. 
 Oh! Ah. 
 It's good to see you, Justin. 
 Aw, hi. 
 Damn, you are lookin' good. 
 Get outta here. 
 A goat would look good to you right now. 
 Yeah, maybe. 
 So where's my old man? 
 He had to take care of something. 
 Why am I not surprised by that? 
 Come on, he's working. 
 Yeah, he's always working. 
 Whatever, I don't care. 
 I just wanted to see you anyways. 
 All right. Let's go get you a hot meal... 
 Whoa. 
 Whoa, what the hell was that? 
 Hey, I'm not that snot-nosed kid anymore. 
 I'll prove it to you, okay? 
 Come on. Let's go. 
 You want me to drive, or do you want to drive? 
 Get in the car. 
 When are we taking Maurice down? 
 Let me rephrase that. 
 We need to take Maurice down. 
 I will. 
 Two weeks max. 
 Two weeks from today? 
 Two weeks from today. 
 Uh-uh. Uh-uh. 
 Nice try. Where is the money? 
 Maurice gives you 5,000 a week. Where is it? 
 He didn't have it. 
 That's funny 'cause my intel said he's stacked. 
 Maybe you should be meeting your intel here and not me. 
 Hank. 
 If I find out you're lying to me, I will bury you. 
 You're gonna be all right, partner. 
 I just... I don't know. 
 How do you know I won't screw this up and she makes me come back? 
 Two reasons. 
 One, because I know you're a good kid, and two, because you know if you do screw up, I'm driving all the way there to kick your ass. 
 Look at you, all grown up. 
 [Laughs] 
 Hey, Aunt Shona. 
 Hank Voight. 
 Shona Williams. 
 Nice to meet you. 
 Here, to help cover costs. 
 I can't take this. 
 Believe me, by the time D'Anthony gets his appetite back, that will barely cover breakfast. 
 That's very nice of you. 
 Thank you. 
 Thank you. 
 Any time.
