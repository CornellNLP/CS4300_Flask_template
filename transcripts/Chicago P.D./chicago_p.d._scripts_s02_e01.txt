 Who called Internal Affairs? 
 Voight's the best there is to handle this. 
 You said this was gonna be a partnership. 
 Lot of different kinds of partnerships. 
 What the hell is going on around here? 
 Just let it go. 
 No! No! 
 Jin, I need a wire on his personal phone and inside his car. 
 You violated my number one rule. 
 Who do you work for? 
 You. 
 Sheldon Jin. 
 I believe he worked in your unit. 
 Sergeant Voight is very familiar with the rules and guidelines of the Chicago Police Department. 
 And he was given a direct order from Street Deputy Horton to answer each and every question truthfully. 
 At this time I'd like to state that Sergeant Voight is only answering these questions under duress. 
 You got something you want to ask me? 
 Ask it. 
 The last person we know Sheldon Jin spoke to was you. 
 There was an outgoing cell phone call from your personal cell to Jin's personal cell an hour before he was killed. 
 Do you remember making that call? 
 I do. 
 Sergeant Voight... 
 Were you in any way involved or did you have any knowledge that would lead to an arrest of the individual responsible for the murder of Chicago police Officer Sheldon Jin? 
 Absolutely not. 
 Are we done? 
 For now. 
 Stay reachable, Sergeant. 
 Nadia's first day. 
 Can she even type? 
 Did we look into that at all? 
 Yeah, she can, smartass. 
 Do not hit on her. 
 Nadia? 
 What kind of a dog do you think I am? 
 How'd it go? 
 It went. 
 They asked some stupid questions. I left. 
 Boss, where they at with Jin's murder? 
 Nowhere. Where's Antonio? 
 He's meeting an informant. 
 He's got a tip on some armored van thing. 
 Sarge, why aren't we looking into Jin's murder on our own? 
 For the same reason I told you last time you asked. 
 They don't want us anywhere near it since we has in our unit, okay? 
 He was a police officer. 
 Area central is all over it. 
 So they had no updates this morning? 
 The update... 
 The update is they're coming after my badge! 
 So when there is another update I will convey it, okay? 
 Until then, just do your jobs. 
 Is it an inside job, or... 
 I already told you what I know. 
 Who gave you this? 
 This guy I'm seeing. And don't ask me his name. I'm not gonna tell you. 
 He's not involved. He just knows the guys who are. 
 This guy you seeing the one who gave you the eye? 
 Yeah, I'm leaving his ass as soon as I have enough money to get to Kansas City. 
 To my sister's place. 
 Well, I gotta be honest. I'm a little suspect, Jellybean. 
 'Cause this is way above your normal level of info. 
 Have I ever lied to you before? 
 She's never lied to me before. 
 I've gotten 12 tips from her in the past. 
 All of them paid off. 
 Trade-safe, route 5, tomorrow. That's it? 
 That's it. 
 It won't be too hard to get someone inside because if this is legit, the armored van company will back our play. 
 All right, set it up. 
 Yep. 
 Is everything all right? 
 Yeah, I'm fine. 
 How much you make an hour? 
 $12.50. 
 How long you been with the company? 
 Six months. 
 What do you hate about the job? 
 I love everything about it. I really do. 
 [Laughs] 
 Hey, Er. How do I look? 
 Great. 
 Great. 
 I'm ready to go. Where do you want me? 
 You know this is the back entrance, right? 
 Oh. 
 Go around the front. 
 Sergeant Platt will give you the paperwork to sign. 
 Cool. Thanks again. 
 Yeah. Okay, off you go. 
 Okay. 
 [Clears throat] 
 We'll be right behind you... eyes and ears... the whole time. 
 You got two distress signals. 
 For visual, just run both hands through your hair. 
 For verbal, just say "popcorn." 
 Popcorn? 
 Either one of those or both, and we're moving in. 
 All right, I got it. 
 Hey. 
 We all go home tonight. 
 Hey, what are we thinking for lunch? 
 What, Mexican, Chinese, burgers? 
 I'm good with anything but Sushi, all right? 
 Had a bad experience once, so... we'll leave it at that. 
 What happened? Did you get sick eating it or something? 
 Eh, you know what? 
 Any time somebody says they had a bad experience with Sushi, it's safe to assume they got sick from it. 
 All-in sick, you know what I'm sayin'? 
 Maybe you choked on it. 
 Up here. What's this? 
 Look out! 
 Damn it! 
 Voight! 
 Better call it in. 
 Yep. 
 [Gunshot] 
 Sheez. 
 [Gunshot] Popcorn! Popcorn! Popcorn! 
 [Gunshots] 
 [Heavy gunfire] 
 [Heavy gunfire] 
 Punch it, go! 
 [Tires squealing] 
 Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! You guys all right? 
 Yeah, we're fine! Let's go! 
 All right! 
 Lincoln 5021 emergency, we have shots fired by the police. 
 Roll an ambo to 1400 West Roosevelt. 
 We have multiple wounded offenders. 
 So the second car came rolling up, guns blazing. 
 I took cover, returned fire... the van was clear in about 30 seconds. 
 They took off. I got the plate numbers, but they came back bogus. 
 Yeah, we're real close to getting an I.D. on this guy. 
 You okay, kid? 
 Yeah, a little close. 
 What do we got down here? 
 [Sighs] 
 How you doing? 
 Little stupid, they got the jump on me, Al. 
 You sure you're okay, man? Not hit anywhere? 
 Yeah. Yeah. 
 No I.D. on the shooter. 
 Running his prints right now. 
 Yeah, truck's been hot for a week. 
 Taken in a carjacking on the West Side. 
 How much was in that van up there? 
 40,000. 
 40,000? 
 That's a hell of a crew for 40k. 
 Yeah, we're thinking the same thing. 
 Is he nice? 
 Super sweet. 
 But, like, a good cop, right? 
 Oh, my God, yeah. 
 Yeah? 
 The sergeant at his last precinct just raved about him. 
 I told you, no more dog cops like the last three I partnered you with. I'm looking out for you, sister. 
 Thank you, Sarge. 
 You're welcome. 
 Oh, here he is. 
 Hey, welcome to the 21st. 
 Hey, Sergeant. 
 Sean Roman, meet your new partner, Kim Burgess. 
 Hi, Sean. I'm really looking forward to working with you. 
 You're messing with me, right? 
 What are you talking about? 
 Well, on the phone, you said "Tim" Burgess. 
 Oh, my gosh. [Sighs] Egg on my face. 
 Okay, Kim and Tim come off my tongue the same sometimes. 
 Anyway, this is Kim... 
 Your new female partner. 
 Looking forward to it. 
 Clearly. 
 Sergeant. 
 Thanks, Bobby. 
 What's that about, Sergeant? 
 Intelligence smoked this guy at the heist this morning. looking for an I.D. 
 His name's Jeff Gamble. 
 He's a dirtbag from my last district. 
 All right. Go park it a sec. 
 Hey, Halstead. 
 Addressed to you, but mailed to the 28th district. 
 It sat there for a while till the desk sergeant figured it out. 
 It was mailed six weeks ago. 
 Wow, that is some real detective work right there. 
 All right... 
 We have the driver, Lee Pritchett. 
 Worked there three months. 
 Had a wife and two-year-old kid at home. 
 Dead crew member, apparently we've got a lead on that. 
 Yeah, Jeff, I knew him from my last... 
 Not yet. 
 And we've got the shooter in the armored van. 
 I.D. and social came back bogus from the company. 
 He started work three days ago. 
 We have calls into the company to find out who hired him and who put him in that van today. 
 Now. 
 D.O.A.'s Jeff Gamble. He's got a sheet five feet long. 
 Possession, domestic battery, burglary, two prior armed robberies. 
 His cousin, Chris Gamble, is basically his partner in crime. 
 Chris wasn't involved himself, but I'll guarantee he'll at least know what Jeff was up to. 
 Well, you and Burgess go find this cousin. 
 All right. 
 Yeah. 
 Morning, Burgess. 
 Ruzek. 
 My new partner, Sean Roman. 
 Hey, man, how you doin'? 
 Hey. 
 This is my partner. 
 Alvin Olinsky. 
 Hey, Sean Roman. We've met. 
 Did we? When? 
 Okay. 
 There's a bunny on the phone for you. 
 Uh, she in jail? 
 I... 
 Look at the caller I.D. if it's an 888 number, that's the jail. 
 You're gonna get a lot of those. 
 312? 
 Take a number. I'll call her back. 
 Okay. Can I return? 
 What's up? 
 Jin sent this to me. 
 What's on the drive? 
 I haven't checked it yet. 
 Show it to Voight. 
 Not until I know what's on it. 
 Steve Kot, state's attorney's office. 
 I need to speak with Sergeant Voight. 
 And what do you do at the state's attorney's office, Steve? 
 I'm an attorney. 
 Oh. 
 It was going good until you said that. 
 Can you just buzz me up? 
 Okay, why the visit? 
 As you know, my office is prosecuting Oskar Bembenek for murder. 
 Alvin put the cuffs on him. 
 Okay. 
 The key piece of evidence is a shirt of Bembenek's with the D.O.A.'s blood on it. 
 That shirt was being transported to a lab in that van this morning. 
 Whoa, whoa, whoa, now why on earth would you do that? 
 Bembenek's attorney successfully petitioned the judge to have the evidence retested at an independent lab. 
 Why wasn't this... 
 I call it crucial bit of information made known to CPD? 
 His attorneys convinced the judge there may be police corruption involved in the case. 
 So... independent lab, independent transport... 
 No one was supposed to know. 
 So this DNA evidence is gone? 
 And this psycho's gonna walk. 
 If I had to hazard a guess, I would say yes. 
 Oskar Bembenek and his younger brother Jacob. 
 Oskar's run a crime outfit for the last 25 years. 
 Prostitution, extortion, drugs, you name it. 
 Now Oskar never gets his hands dirty. 
 He always subcontracts when it comes to taking people out. 
 That's how he's lasted so long. 
 This murder charge, what's that about? 
 He just had a mistress. 
 Just wanted to break up with him. 
 So he stabs her. 
 25 times. 
 His shirt? It's got her blood on it. 
 Now, I knew this girl. 
 I knew this girl. 
 Josie Martin. 
 I was trying to turn her out as an informant against him. 
 [Phone rings] 
 Intelligence, Atwater. 
 I'll be back. 
 Thanks. 
 The supervisor from the armored van company I've been trying to get a hold of just went home sick. 
 You and Halstead, let's go. 
 Hey. Text me the address. 
 Gotcha. 
 My guy was approached by some of the guys in the crew who pulled off the job. 
 He wasn't involved. He was with me all morning. 
 Fine. Great. 
 All you gotta do is give me his name. 
 No, no way. 
 I'm sure he's got something on his record, right? 
 I'll make it look like that's why I'm picking him up. 
 Your name will never be mentioned. 
 Come on. 
 Me and my whole team could have got wiped out. 
 He wasn't involved. 
 I believe you. 
 I just want his name to find the guys who did. 
 Huh? 
 So my name won't come up? 
 No. 
 Because I'm pretty sure if they're trying to kill you this morning, they're not gonna have a problem trying to kill me. 
 All right. 
 Here's what I want you to do. 
 Just... I want you to keep your mouth shut. 
 Just drop the whole thing, all right? 
 Okay. Yeah, I can do that. 
 Yeah? 
 Mm-hmm. 
 [Indistinct, overlapping chatter] 
 Hello, Oskar. 
 -Detective Olinsky. 
 Yeah. 
 You mind stepping out for a second and letting me have a quick word with your boss? 
 Whoa! 
 Hey, hey, hey. 
 It's okay. 
 You know, I know you were behind the heist this morning. 
 Heist? 
 Oh, yeah. 
 I don't think so. No. 
 You remember the old days? 
 You ran from the police, you were guaranteed a beating, but you shoot at the police... 
 It was guaranteed death. 
 Now I am considered one of the last of the old-timers, Oskar. 
 And I am coming for you. 
 That's the truck that rammed us. 
 Forensics already dusted for prints, I want you two to go through it top to bottom. 
 See if they missed anything. 
 You got it, boss. 
 What are we looking for here? Traps or something? 
 Step aside before you hurt yourself. 
 Hey, yeah, you know... 
 A simple "I got this" would suffice, Kev. 
 I got this. 
 So what's on the drive? 
 Did you know Jin was working with IA? 
 I didn't. 
 Any shot Voight was mixed up with them? 
 Don't get stupid on me now, Jay. 
 Luke Hendricks? 
 [Continued knocking] 
 Body. 
 Unh! Police! 
 Clear! 
 Police! 
 Clear! 
 [Exhales] 
 Yep, that's Hendricks. 
 Looks like he was trying to clear out. 
 Okay. So he's working for Bembenek... 
 He hires the shooter in the armored van, and then he tips off the crew when he knows that we've got a guy in there and we're following. 
 I'll call it in. 
 [Rock music playing] 
 You ever work in a bar before? 
 Nah. You? 
 No. 
 You ever work with a female cop before, Roman? 
 Yeah. My last partner was female. 
 Hi, Sean. 
 What's up, Lisa? 
 Thought you transferred out of this district? 
 I did. But I'm back on business. 
 That okay with you? 
 I could care less. 
 Could you make it quick? It's just me behind the bar. 
 You hear about Jeff Gamble today? 
 I did. 
 He went out in a blaze of glory, huh? 
 Ah, yeah. Shooting at cops... it's... Real glorious. 
 Forget I said it. 
 We're looking for his cousin, Chris. 
 You seen him? 
 Not in a week or so. 
 Well... he walks in, you call me. 
 I find out Chris was in here, and you didn't call me, I'm gonna get pissed. 
 Like 2009 St. Patty's Day pissed. 
 Got it. 
 Good. 
 What do we got? 
 We found something. 
 Truck hit Voight's car about 35 miles an hour. 
 Hardly any damage. 
 There's a two-inch steel channel welded right behind the bumper. 
 They were planning on ramming something. 
 It was stolen about a week ago, so it was definitely retrofitted between then and now. 
 And that's quality work under there. 
 Talk about a high-end shop. I can start asking around. 
 Bembenek's got a guy who does custom choppers for him. 
 Hey, Fritz. 
 Still in the Oskar Bembenek business, I take it. 
 Not for a long time, no. 
 The pickup truck. 
 You know all about it. 
 Pickup? 
 Yeah. 
 Fritz, look. We're gonna give you the benefit of the doubt here, okay? 
 When you attached that metal plate to the stolen truck you thought, uh, Bembenek was gonna enter it into a... demolition derby, if those... they still exist? 
 Yeah, they do. 
 They do? 
 We should go to one of those. That's fantastic. 
 See, you're doing great so far. 
 You didn't know he was gonna give it to his crew to try and take out a couple of cops. 
 Now that you do know that, it's probably best that you wake up a little bit before the full force of the CPD comes down on your ass. 
 Listen... listen... hey, hey... 
 We need a connect between Bembenek and the retrofit on that pickup. 
 I wasn't here when the order came in, okay? 
 Let me just talk to my guy who was here. 
 He's not working today. 
 Sooner than later. 
 Yeah. 
 Hey, hey, hey. 
 Sooner than later. 
 Okay. 
 Come in. 
 You're gonna want to take a look at this. 
 Jin sent it to me. 
 Need something? 
 No, I don't. You do. 
 Namely? 
 A good lawyer. 
 Partial transcript of the wire Jin had on ya. 
 Yeah, you leaned on him over his father's gambling debts, forced him to do off-book surveillance. 
 Threatened to kill him if he told anyone. 
 Well, you know how it works. 
 Just get out in front of it. 
 Make a deal. 
 If I go down for Jin's murder, two things are gonna happen in quick succession. 
 I will tell everyone that you had a deal with Internal Affairs. 
 I'm sure your fellow cops would love to hear that one. 
 Then... 
 I will give a full and accurate account of our relationship. 
 And they will come for your job. 
 So you can go down the tubes, Voight... 
 Or you and I can just walk away from each other, and Jin's murder stays unsolved. 
 Just another guy that got in over his head in Chicago. 
 I don't need to tell you there've been many. 
 
 
 
 [Phone rings] 
 Chicago Police Department. Intelligence. How may I help you? 
 Hey. Your C.I. give you any more info? 
 No. That's a dead end. 
 Hey. Hang on. 
 Lindsay? Bunny again. 
 Take a number. I'll call her back. 
 Can I have her return? 
 So? 
 What's the plan? 
 Regarding? 
 The thumb drive I gave you. 
 When's Stillwell from Internal Affairs getting popped? 
 Yeah, well, there's a lot of moving parts. 
 It's gonna take some time. 
 I don't understand. 
 And you don't need to. I'm on top of it. 
 Okay, great. 
 I'd like to have the thumb drive back, Sergeant. 
 It's late. Go home. 
 I'd like to have the thumb drive back... 
 No. 
 At a certain point I was like, why am I trying so hard to be nice to this guy? 
 I hear you. 
 'Cause I mean, what a jerk. 
 Totally. 
 Hey. 
 Hey. 
 It's killing me not being able to kiss you at work, you know that? 
 Yeah... but... you can't... you know that I'll never make it into... Intelligence if it gets out. 
 Yeah, yeah, yeah. 
 I just want you to know that, you know, it kills me having to act like I'm just a guy friend around you. 
 Yeah, but what would you do if you were in my shoes? 
 Would you call Roman out, or would you... 
 Burgess. 
 Can we not talk about this guy for just a little bit? 
 Just a little. 
 Yeah, sorry. 
 All right? 
 Okay, yeah. 
 Okay. 
 [Laughs] 
 Now come here, you. 
 To the bedroom! 
 [Laughs] 
 [Rock music playing] 
 ♪ ♪ 
 Hey. 
 So let me ask you something. 
 Straight up. 
 Do you think there's any shot that Voight was involved with Jin's murder? 
 Are you out of your mind? 
 That's an answer to a different question. 
 No. 
 There is no way he's involved. 
 Yeah, well, he's gonna bury the case, for God knows what reason. 
 Why? What reason would he have? 
 Do you really think that you know everything about this guy? 
 [Indistinct radio chatter] 
 Hey. 
 How you doing? 
 Hank. 
 Sorry about your C.I., Al. 
 But it proves we're on the right track. 
 Keep working the other leads. 
 Right. You should go home, Nadia. 
 Um, I can't. I want to get situated. 
 I have a lot to get familiar with. 
 Fine. 
 You don't have to stand every time I walk by. 
 Okay. 
 Hey, Sergeant? 
 Hmm? 
 Just want to thank you for this opportunity. 
 I'm gonna do a great job. 
 [Phone rings] 
 Hello? 
 Okay, I'll tell him. 
 There's a Susan Jin downstairs? 
 She wants to speak with you? 
 Mrs. Jin, I'm Hank Voight. 
 Susan Jin. 
 Hi. 
 Very nice to meet you. 
 Sheldon's dream since he was a young boy was to be a police officer. 
 It was hard for him at the academy and his first few posts. 
 He was teased, and he thought about quitting. 
 Working for you was the first time he really felt part of a team. 
 So, at least I know he died having fulfilled his dream. 
 Thank you. 
 Three threats were made on Jin's life, all recorded. 
 "I will kill you," unquote. 
 It's all in there. 
 Stillwell even tells Jin how he'd do it and were he'd dump Jin's body... 
 Which is the exact location Jin was found. 
 Who's this now? 
 Chris Gamble's great aunt's place. 
 She might still be in Boca, though. 
 Hey, I called around on your ex-partner, Jenn Cassidy. 
 Word is, she's a great cop. 
 It'd be one thing if she were a dog cop. 
 Then, you know, maybe I could understand why you've got a stick up your ass about females. 
 But since she's solid, apparently, that... I don't know... can only mean that you're sexist. 
 I fell in love with her. Okay? 
 Like an idiot. 
 So I transferred out. 
 That's why I'm a little gun-shy with female partners. 
 Oh. 
 Hi, Ms. Gamble. I'm Officer Roman. 
 This is my female partner, Officer Burgess. 
 Hello. 
 Hi. 
 We're looking for Chris. 
 I haven't seen him since I got back into town. 
 Okay, but it's really important that I talk with him, ma'am. For his own safety. 
 Of course. 
 I'll call you if he comes by. 
 [Toilet flushes] 
 Have a good day. 
 Who's in there? 
 No one. 
 What's up, Chris? 
 Run! 
 [Grunts] 
 Ya! 
 [Grunts] 
 Don't move! 
 [Coughing] 
 Turn around! 
 Look away! 
 Look away! 
 Ah! 
 What'd he say? 
 What'd he say? 
 [Panting] 
 See, Chris, nobody knows this. 
 It's one of my favorite surprises to lay on guys like you that are sitting across from me. 
 Say you and your buddies... I don't know... 
 Rob an armored van. 
 Somebody gets killed. 
 Even if it was one of the bad guys... even if that person was killed by the police... 
 Somebody's gotta get charged for that murder. 
 So... 
 We're gonna prove that you were there yesterday. 
 And in addition to the attempted murder of a police officer, you are gonna get charged with the murder of the van driver. 
 And the murder of your own cousin. 
 Or, Chris... 
 Or... 
 You give us the other participants, and you let them take the ride. 
 You can't be happy with how this went down, right? 
 Your cousin gets killed for what? 
 Mm. 
 How much did Bembenek pay you to get the shirt? 
 Yeah, we know all about it. 
 So quit trying to figure a way out, Chris. 
 It's over. 
 [Exhales] 
 It wasn't supposed to go down the way that it went down. 
 They never told us cops were gonna be there. 
 Who's they? 
 Oskar and his brother, Jacob. 
 They said it was just going to be a security team from the van company that would be following. 
 And that there would be more money. 
 That's why we weren't handing it over until we get more. 
 Hand what over? 
 The bloody shirt. 
 The evidence bag. 
 We told Oskar that he needed to come up with 200k or we were dropping it to the nearest police station. 
 Where's the bag right now? 
 My buddy Christian's got it. 
 But I'm supposed to meet him and back him up for the trade-off with Oskar. 
 Edwin Stillwell? 
 You're under arrest for the murder of Chicago police Officer Sheldon Jin. 
 I don't know what you heard, but let me set things straight. 
 In order to get my job back, I made a deal with I.A. 
 The deal was I put myself out there as dirty so I can take down some high-level criminals. 
 I never agreed nor did I ever report on another cop. 
 You can like it or not, that was the deal. 
 [Phone rings] 
 Intelligence. 
 We should gear up for our meet. 
 Yeah. 
 Mm-hmm. 
 Sergeant? That was Commander Perry. 
 You're wanted back down at the Ivory Tower immediately. 
 All right, call back down there. 
 You tell 'em I want Tim O'Leary at that meeting. 
 Tim O'Leary. 
 Okay. 
 Hey, uh... 
 You got this? 
 I do. 
 Sarge. 
 Sit down! 
 Now whether this evidence bag was open or not, or if it broke chain of custody, I don't really give a damn. 
 That's for the state's attorney's office to worry about. 
 Main this is to get Oskar Bembenek showing up with 200k, and heads will roll from there. 
 Wait for the money to be handed over first, then move in. 
 Then we move in quick. 
 Okay? As you can tell, Bembenek and his brother have no problem getting violent. 
 All right? 
 Hey, Lindsay, Lindsay... 
 I know how you're feeling. 
 Al... 
 You don't. 
 All right, Gamble, let's get you wired. 
 Kill a cop? 
 When you say it like that I sound like a real dick. 
 Yeah. 
 Show me. 
 Let's go. 
 Happy? 
 Do it. 
 Oh, come on. Whoa, whoa. 
 Move in, move in! 
 [Tires squealing] 
 [Sirens wailing] 
 [Police radio chatter] 
 Put your guns down! 
 Put your guns down! 
 What did I just say? 
 On the ground, now! 
 Give it to me. 
 On the ground! On your knees! 
 Let me see your hands! 
 Put 'em up! 
 Stay in the car. What are you doin'? 
 It's all good! It's all... 
 [gunshots] 
 No! No! No! Jacob! 
 Up where I can see 'em! 
 Put your hands up where I can see 'em, now! 
 No! Jacob! 
 Don't move! 
 Jacob! 
 [Grunts] 
 You shot my brother. 
 It hurts, tough guy? 
 What's that, tough guy? Huh? 
 Come on. 
 Jacob! 
 Lincoln 5021 emergency. 
 We have shots fired by the police. 
 Roll and ambo to 35th and Hamilton. 
 Copy that, Lincoln 5021. 
 Voight. 
 They're ready for you. 
 Gentlemen. 
 There've been some serious allegations made against you by Stillwell. 
 Backed up by recorded conversations where you promised to give him part of your street tax. 
 Now we're gonna need your badge and gun until we conduct a thorough investigation because this... 
 I'm sorry to interrupt, Commander, but may I have a minute alone with Chief O'Leary? 
 Literally, 60 seconds. 
 That's fine. 
 Let's go. 
 Sheldon Jin feared for his life.
