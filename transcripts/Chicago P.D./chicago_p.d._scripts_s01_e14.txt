 We got a rat in here, bro. 
 I need you to stay on top of Voight's phone calls, emails, his whereabouts, everything. 
 So who's Charlie? 
 He's a guy I used to run with. 
 Run with or run from? 
 I want him out of here. 
 We had a deal! 
 I keep my word. 
 [Gunshots] 
 We got officers down! You see anything? 
 10-1, squad! Officer shot. 
 Adres Dias convicted of several drug-related murders... 
 Hey, he's gonna be okay. 
 All right? 
 Thank you. 
 Look. 
 Mrs. Dawson. 
 Is he gonna be all right? 
 We're gonna monitor him closely, but he may need a second surgery. 
 He's not out of the woods yet. 
 Can I see him? 
 Of course. 
 Right here. 
 Antonio. 
 [Gasping] 
 [Raspy] Hey, baby. 
 Hi, honey. 
 Hey, big guy. 
 Hey. 
 Belden? 
 Gone. 
 Those guards? 
 Both dead. 
 Find him. 
 We will. 
 Dad's gonna live, right? 
 Oh. 
 He's gonna be okay? 
 Absolutely. 
 He's gonna be fine. 
 You know, when I was your age, my father was in this very same hospital. 
 Your dad is one of the toughest cops I know. 
 He's gonna walk out of here stronger than ever. 
 Listen, you two stay here with Laura and the kids. 
 They don't leave your sight. You hear me? 
 Yes, sir. 
 Sarge, no disrespect. 
 I'd rather be out there hunting down Pulpo. 
 What is more important than protecting Antonio and his family? 
 [Sighs] 
 [Typing] 
 Are you lost? 
 Last time I checked, this was your boss's desk. 
 I'm installing new incident-reporting software on all of the Intelligence computers. 
 Well, when you're finished here, will you come down and fix mine? It froze up. 
 Of course. 
 I'll be right down. 
 Erin. 
 Hey. 
 Oh, Annie. 
 Good to see you. 
 You too. 
 Um, I'm sorry. 
 One of my partners got shot, and I've been at the hospital, and I should have texted you. 
 Oh, no, it's all right. 
 Am I in trouble? 
 No. No, no, no. 
 Not at all. 
 Hey, bud. 
 You gonna come say hi to me? 
 Hey, Erin. 
 What? 
 What is going on with you? Are you sprouting? 
 When did you get so tall? 
 [Chuckles] 
 You give me and your mom a minute? 
 Okay. 
 Listen, I'm sorry I made you come all the way here. 
 I just wanted to tell you in person. 
 Charlie's back. 
 Why is he back? 
 I don't know, but he asked about you. 
 Did you tell him about Travis? 
 Of course not. 
 But he's here, so how do you want to play this? 
 I can tell him to leave you alone, or I can give him your phone number, or I can pick a place for all of us to meet, and I can be there. 
 Yeah, I want you to be there. 
 Okay. 
 Okay, I'll set it up. 
 Thanks. 
 Listen up. 
 What Pulpo did downstairs was an attack on our family. 
 First Willhite and now Antonio. 
 So let me be clear. 
 Forget warrants. Forget the rules. 
 It's on us to catch him. 
 And when we do, he's to be handed off to me and Alvin. 
 [Door opens and closes] 
 They found a possible getaway vehicle up on division. 
 Any sign of Pulpo? 
 One dead male. 
 No confirmation on the body yet. 
 Let's go. 
 Hey, sarge. 
 I'm just looking for a little clarification on what you just said. 
 Pulpo ain't making it back to a jail cell. 
 That clear enough for you? 
 [Siren wails] 
 Thanks. 
 Well, what do you got? 
 All fake. 
 They took a regular van and put the decals on it, so it looks like a paddy wagon. 
 The prison transport van that Pulpo escaped in was found six blocks from the district. 
 He ditched it, and he switched to this. 
 All right, where's the body? 
 Over here. 
 Driver's wearing a mall security badge someone bought at an army surplus store. 
 Forensics I.D.'d the prints. 
 His name's Carlos Guvera. 
 He's a known bagman for the Colombian cartel. 
 Oh, and Pulpo couldn't let the guy live to talk. 
 Hey, guys, Pulpo's girlfriend and son were with him. 
 How much you want a bet he's taking his family unit and hightailing it back to Colombia? 
 We got his name and his mug shot at every border checkpoint. 
 Train stations, airports. 
 If Pulpo planned this far, you better believe he planned for a way to get out. 
 What do you have for me? 
 [Sighs] 
 I was able to download all those reports and emails. 
 Do you think that Voight is gonna leave any real dirt on his computer under a file labeled "corruption"? 
 Jin, I need a wire on his Nextel, his personal phone, and inside his car. 
 Listen, I'm planning on ramping up surveillance on him soon. 
 Planning on it? 
 If you don't give me something that I can use by next week, I'm going to make sure that your father gets a visit from the FBI. 
 [Flash drive clatters] 
 [Sighs] 
 Don't think you understand... 
 I absolutely understand. 
 No. 
 I agree with you. 
 So we're all willing to just go off book for Voight? 
 Look, I'm four months out of the academy, man. 
 I just do what I'm told. 
 Even if that means being part of a lynch mob? 
 If you're asking if I'm gonna turn over my shield and protest, no, I'm not. 
 Are you? I mean... what I'm saying is, what do we do? 
 If we find Pulpo, are we just gonna turn him over to Voight? 
 All right, everybody relax. 
 What we do is find Pulpo, and then we can figure it out. 
 Yeah, that's exactly what we needed, yeah. 
 Hey, anything at Lina's house? 
 Marshals stormed it. Came up empty. 
 What about Lina's family? 
 Her mom's got a place on the south side, came up clean, and so did her cell phone records, but I think it's worth a drive-by. 
 Good. Take someone and go do it. 
 So last guy loyal to him, he kills. 
 No friends, no family. 
 Who else do you have? 
 What about Pulpo's lawyer, Anthony Timpone? 
 Timpone. 
 He reps half the criminals in the city. 
 He didn't get that rep by cooperating with the police, I'll tell you that. 
 I got an idea. 
 When my parents got divorced, my ma had this guy call in a threat to my dad's office. 
 He was checking for bombs underneath his car for months. 
 Sergeant. 
 [Grunts] 
 Hey, you got a Spanish speaker on shift? 
 Hey, Garcia, play pass-the-bum to Andrews, and get your ass over here. 
 What's up? 
 Hey, man. 
 I need you to call in a death threat. 
 All right? Come on. 
 You never know when it's your time to shine. 
 Go. 
 El abogado es un hombre muerto. 
 Lo entiendes? 
 Timpone esta muerto. 
 Estamos llegando. 
 Estamos llegando. That convincing enough? I bought it. Hey, wait. Easy, easy. C.P.D., big guy. All right? Wait. Wait! You can't go in there. What the hell? Ooh, what's with the hardware, Timpone? I have a permit. We're looking for Pulpo. Yeah, apparently, he's looking for me. I just got a call from him. Hmm. What do you make of that? A call from Pulpo? That ain't good. But you don't come cheap. So what happened? Pulpo spend his last chunk of change on you? Got life, now he wants a refund? Yeah, that's why I got him. You think that you and some rent-a-cop are gonna keep him from getting in here if he really wanted to? Mm-mm. I've arrested a lot of scumbags you've put back out on the street, so I got to be honest with you. I don't give a damn what happens to you, but if you got anything that can help me find Pulpo, it might be good for both of us. During Pulpo's trial, he asked where he could buy sets of new identities, top-of-the-line papers. So I referred him to an old client of mine. What's his name? Neil Bunker... he's a notary public. He's got a camera joint on North Clark. Bunker's been arrested for everything from bogus passports to counterfeit Bulls tickets. So let's see if Pulpo's left any bread crumbs. Hey there. Welcome. Officers. How can I help you? Recognize him? No. You sure? Mm-hmm. Don't worry about him. We heard if someone's looking for clean I.D.'s and credit cards, they come to you. You want to get some pictures developed, great. But otherwise... Mm-mm. You sure you don't recognize him? No. No? No. What kind of shop are you running here? It's just a photo shop. That's what we do... photos. I don't know what to tell you. Bring him back here. Come on. So what's this little operation? No, I... no, I... this... Looks like somebody got a haircut. [Camera beeping] Got Pulpo. [Both grunt] Okay, let's start over. Where's Pulpo? I know who he is. I'm not having him come after me. You're gonna have to arrest me. Who said anything about arrest? I mean, all I know is, you took a shot at a police officer. What? Pick it up. Pick it up. Go ahead, pick it up. Don't look at me. Listen, you have two choices. You can shoot your way out of here, or you can tell me about Pulpo. I made him three sets of I.D.'s and a couple of credit cards to match. Was he with a woman and a kid? Yes. And you have no idea where they're going? No. Yeah, of course not. No, I swear. [Sighs] Hey, take him in. Book him. Yeah. Aiding and abetting. But I talked. Not fast enough. Anything off the P.O.D.'s? [Sighs] No, but I've got every electric eye in the city wide open. What about the Sumner thing? What about it? I told you to look into her. You getting stupid on me? Uh, no. No. Yeah. Here. I pulled all her calls in the last week. Any with internal affairs? Um, I think she made three calls over there to a Edwin Stillwell. I don't know what they're about, though. I mean, she might have a case pending. Where's Burgess? Went to the bathroom. Fixing her makeup, huh? Maybe. How's he doing? Resting. He's a fighter. Combos. Hi. Thanks so much. The kids love those. No biggie. How you doing? Hanging in there. Good. Thanks. You know, I've known your dad a long time. We were on the same patrol unit back when he was a rookie. And we went on this call one time, chased this dealer into a crack house. He shot at us through the door with a 12-gauge. I got hit in the hip and went down. And this bad guy, he would have finished me off, but your dad, he ran over and picked me up. He carried you? He did. I was a little thinner back then. So they plucked the buckshot out of me, and they stuck me behind a desk. But if it wasn't for your dad... [Scoffs] [Chuckles] Uh-huh. All right, keep us posted. Thanks. Anything on Lina's mom's house? No, zip, but I've got a couple of undercovers parked down the street. At the hospital... I've never heard Voight talk about his father. What's the whole story? Nothing you can't find in the Sun-Times archives. You lived with him. Look, all I know is that every time a cop gets shot in this city, Voight gets that same look in his eye. [Cell phone chimes] I need some air. [Sighs] Must feel strange going to a police station every day voluntarily. I got to make this quick. Hey, what ever happened to Voight? Let me guess. Dead or in jail. Actually, he's my boss. Your boss. [Scoffs] Up in here? That's right. [Chuckles] Classic. That's classic. Okay, well, you can tell him to leave me alone. Tell him I got flushed down the toilet, so you could play cop. Ring a bell? You don't even know. Listen, you got a son, Charlie, with Annie. His name's Travis, and he was born six months after you left. What? How come no one told me? No one could get a hold of you. I'm gonna set up a time for us all to meet. I'll be in touch. Hey. Okay. We've got a hit. Lina's fake I.D., Maria Esposito, was just used along with her fake credit card to rent a vehicle from midway 20 minutes ago. You got eyes on 'em? Even better. It's got a GPS tracker on it. Got its exact location. Heading north on Pulaski. Beautiful. Sumner, you're out. Oh, okay, I'll stay back and watch the... No, you're out of my unit. You're transferred. As of tomorrow, you work in narcotics. You can't transfer me. I already made the call. You're making a mistake. My mistake was letting you stay around this long. You got the day to pack your desk and pass off your files. 
 
 [Car horn honking] [Tires squealing] Where is he? Five blocks up ahead. Still going northbound. I don't see an SUV. Hold up. They just pulled off. We got a visual. No sirens. A lot of people here. Get in your car. Get in your car. Get down! Get down! Hey, hey, hey. Stay in your car! Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Go. Go. Go. No driver! Can't see in. I can't clear this. Ready? Put your hands up. Get 'em up! Up! Put your hands up! Get away from the door. Put 'em on your head. Come over. He's not in there. Where's Pulpo? [Cuffs clink] Where's Pulpo? So how did you think this was gonna work out, Lina? You guys were gonna leave and just be a big happy family in South America? I want to see my son. You tell us where Pulpo's headed, you can see him. Adres told me to rent a truck and then pick him up at a Taqueria at Fifth and Pulaski off the highway at 5:00. Anything else? He said if anything changed, he'd call me. The throwaway phone we found on her has zero calls. Pulpo ain't gonna be at Fifth and Pulaski. He used her and the kid as a diversion. He wanted her to get caught to throw us off the scent. Hey, just hand her over to major crimes, and notify child services on her kid. Let's go. Everyone go back and check every scrap of paper we have on Pulpo. I don't care if it's a jailhouse lunch wrapper he left in the cage. Every known associate, rival, anything you can find. [Door slams] I'm sorry things didn't work out. [Sighs] I didn't get a chance to look at them, considering. Catch this guy. For Antonio. Hey, Atwater, I just got a text from Ruzek. You got a hot date? No. Voight gave Sumner the boot. Damn. They're gonna need to replace her. True. Let's agree that we both deserve that spot. Bet. Yeah. Hey, guys, check this out. It's a motion for assets petition filed on behalf of Adres Dias. Someone tried to bond Pulpo out. His bond was set at $1 million. He never made bail. Yeah, but somebody tried. Stepan Nestrov put his nightclub up as an asset, but it wasn't worth enough. Nestrov... a Russian. Come here. Nestrov's part of the Elston Ave crew. Fresh-off-the-boat Russians shipped over to do dirty work for the old-timers, but they decided to break off on their own. Yeah, and the Russians hate the Colombians. Then why'd they try to bond Pulpo out? Just get the address of that club. Police! Hands up! Everybody, hands in the air! Hands in the air! Put your hands behind your head! [Gunshots] [Grunts] Back up! Don't look at me. [Overlapping shouting] Get down! Get down on the ground! Get down! Turn around! Get on the ground. Get down, you too. Down on the ground. Spread your legs open. 5021 emergency. Shots fired at the police. Suspect's gonna need an ambulance. Back's clear. I see a lot more cocaine. No Pulpo. Get your arms out. Spread 'em out. Spread 'em out. Spread your legs. So why would you put up your nightclub to bond out a Colombian drug lord who's wanted for murder, huh? Somebody dating somebody's sister? [Speaking Russian] What was that? Hey, you guys, this laptop you confiscated from his club, I cracked the password, but I can't read any of the emails. They're all in Cyrillic. It's gonna take me forever to translate this. Great. I don't suppose we have a cop on shift that reads Russian too. I know a guy. So looks like most of these are back and forth to his girlfriend in Moscow. Uh, wait. Here's one about a shipment on Aeroflot. What's that? It's a Russian airline. You think it's about shipping coke? I don't know. There's an attachment, though. Um, it's for a transport trailer. You don't need a transport trailer to move a couple of gym bags of coke. Yeah, but you do need one for SUV's. This is a bill of lading listing two vehicles being shipped on an aeroflot cargo plane from O'Hare to Moscow. Come on in, Brian. It's all right. Come on. Ask him what he's doing with Pulpo. [Speaking Russian] Tell him... tell him if he talks, I'll charge one of his boys down in the cage with the cocaine, and he walks. [Speaking Russian] Mm. [Speaking Russian] Hmm? He asked if you're serious. He knows my reputation from the street. I keep my word. [Speaking Russian] [Speaking Russian] Octopus... [Speaking Russian] He says the octopus fronted them $1 million in cocaine. That's why he's helping him. He owes him. Is Pulpo in that container? [Speaking Russian] Da. Yes. [Speaking Russian] [Speaking Russian] It leaves at 3:00. That's in two hours. Thanks. [Tires squealing] What's the problem? Just follow us. Be cool. Come on down. Take him outside, and stay there. Ready? Let's go. [Alarm wailing] [Coughing] [Groaning] Hey, Pulpo. Remember me? [Grunting] No! You can take off. Now. [Engine turns over] Well, that's that, then. Go get the driver. Yeah. Que haces? Come on. Wait! [Grunts] What... Wait, wait, wait, wait. I can give you the Russians. I can give you the Mexicans. Come on, man. I don't care. Come on, man. Just arrest me, man! Come on! Take me to jail, man! [Muffled shouting] [Muffled shouting continues] Be dark in an hour. [Monitors beeping steadily] How you doing? I'm dying of thirst. Mmm. Hey. We got him. I didn't see it on the news. I'm not sure you will. Oh. [Footsteps, indistinct conversation] Come here. The guy who killed Olinsky's partner, Browning... supposedly they took him to the docks on River Road. And did what? Took him for a boat ride. Jay, I want Pulpo punished for what he did, but I don't want that on my conscience. Do you? Feels like deja vu. A little, yeah. You know, I was never sure if you killed Browning because of Eddie or because you were trying to make up for your father. He murdered our partner. Yeah. What happened to my father had nothing to do with it. Browning... He ever keep you awake at night? I sleep like a baby. [Sighs] Well, I haven't slept right in 20 years. That's not 'cause we killed Browning. It's 'cause he killed your partner, and you weren't there to stop it. [Sighs] Yep. All right, so have we learned anything? He's gonna die in prison. We're just speeding up the process. [Chuckles] Come on. It's time. [Sighs] [Muffled shouting] [Grunting] [Muffled shouting] Get up. I got him. Shut up. [Chains clanking] You ever go swimming with a Chicago necklace? [Muffled shouting] [Muffled] No! [Crying] Oh, no! No! No! No! No! [Muffled scream] [Muffled screaming] You can't do this. You went to see Antonio. What Antonio wants... and what Pulpo deserves are two different things. We need to turn him in. He dies right here... Right now. [Grunts] [Coughing] Whoa, whoa, whoa. Wait. Wait a second. Wait a second. The kid's right, man. We got him. We won. Alvin. No, not now... Not tonight... Not tonight. [Strangled groaning] [Groaning] You got him? We got him, Detective. Come on. All right, these are all the files right here. Thanks. [Car door closes, engine turning over] Hey, sarge, you wanted to see us? Yeah. You may have heard we have a spot open. Yes, sir. I want to fill it right away. Congratulations, Atwater. You just made Intelligence. Uh, thank you, sir. I appreciate that. All right, you start tomorrow. Congrats, Kevin. Thank you. Would you give me a sec? No doubt. Sir, can I ask why? You didn't make the cut? You're good police, Burgess. I just don't tolerate in-house romance... Especially from a uniform who should be doing everything she can to prove she's fully committed to the job. No, it's... Dismissed. Thank you, sir. Get the door. Hey, hey. Is everything all right? What happened? Hey. Hey. May I come in? Yeah. [Sighs] It's been a while since I've been here. You know, everything that happened to Antonio... Made me start thinking a lot about Eddie. After he was killed, I put a lot of distance between me and you. Alvin, are you okay? [Breathing deeply] I want to make things right between us. Al... Hey, come here. [Crying] You're late. I got caught up with something. And what is that? I thought it'd be nice. For a five-year-old. Travis is 12. And I told you, you can't just invoke your father-son privileges already. Hey, T. I want you to meet somebody. This is Charlie. Me and him and your mom... we all grew up together. We're old friends. Pleasure to meet you, Travis. You a Bears fan? Yeah. Ah. Who's your favorite player? Urlacher. Urlacher. That's a good choice. But I'm old school. Can't beat Singletary. Your mom still a Packers fan? Don't remind me. [Chuckling] Tell me about it. Well, all right. Well, I just wanted to stop by and say hey. It's been a while. I'm glad that you did, Charlie. You got a sec? Yeah. I'll be right back. Erin. Erin. Yes or no? Do you owe me? Are you kidding? Do you have something cooking already? Don't blow this, Charlie. Yes or no? Do you owe me? Yeah, sure. Good answer. Hey. Let me have another Manhattan. Sure. Whatever he's having. Two of those. You got it. You're gonna hear me out first. I deal with things in the moment. I make the best decision that I can. Sometimes I'm right. Sometimes I'm wrong. And I accept that, and I move forward, knowing I did the best I can to protect this city. I have my convictions, and I don't give a damn what anybody thinks of 'em. You have yours as well, Jay. I know that. And I respect that. Cheers.
