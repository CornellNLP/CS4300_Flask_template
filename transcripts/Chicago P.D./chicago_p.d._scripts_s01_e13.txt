 Colombian hit squad. 
 .22 hollow point. 
 It's an assassin's bullet. 
 Somebody wanted a bigger piece of the pie for himself? 
 Gustav Munoz. 
 Find out where in my city this guy thinks he can hide. 
 You remember Pulpo, right? 
 He kidnapped my son. 
 He's pulling Pulpo off MCC and using him as bait to draw Gustav Munoz. 
 What's up with you and rebel without a cause? 
 Nothing. He's engaged. 
 [Laughs] My fiancée. 
 You're gonna tie the knot, huh? 
 I'm just sick of planning. 
 Who called Internal Affairs? 
 You said this is gonna be a partnership. 
 There's a lotta different kinds of partnerships. 
 I have 8 people working underneath me and another 12 cops that report to me. 
 Guess who takes up 75% of my time? 
 Your gravely-voiced ass. 
 You know, I'd like to think the arrest record of my unit... 
 When I go in for my annual review, it's measured on the number of arrests that you make working in conjunction with Internal Affairs, and so far, that number's one... 
 Maurice Owens. 
 I know for a fact that you're out there on the street and you're rubbing shoulders with scum, and I can only imagine how much money you've taken and not vouchered. 
 Sounds like you're getting some fuzzy intel, Edwin, 'cause that ain't happening. 
 I have a solution as to how you can start working it off more effectively. 
 There's a narcotics detective that we've had our eye on for some time... 
 I don't go after other cops. 
 That was the first thing out of my mouth when I made my little deal here, so you can shake your ass all you want. 
 That ain't changing. 
 You will give me more, or you will be gone. 
 First and final warning. 
 Hey, Adam. 
 Hey. 
 Burgess? 
 Yeah? 
 You got a second? Can I talk to you? 
 Sure. 
 How's your niece doing? 
 She's doing better. Thank you. 
 So listen, I know I've been sending some mixed signals lately. 
 Oh, no. No, it takes two to... mix signals, so... 
 Those are gonna stop. 
 Okay. 
 Decided I'm gonna give my relationship with Wendy a real go, you know? 
 [Exhales] 
 I just wanted to tell you. 
 Yeah. Yeah. 
 Absolutely. Of course. 
 I'm sorry about all this. 
 No. 
 Okay. 
 Okay. 
 Burgess. 
 Officer Burgess. 
 Yeah? 
 Go to the locker room, throw some cold water on your face, then tell yourself three times he was never yours to begin with. 
 Go. 
 Okay. 
 Hi, I'm looking for Erin Lindsay. 
 Are you? 
 I'm an old friend. My name's Charlie. 
 You can leave your name and number. 
 I'll make sure she gets the message. 
 Here you go. 
 You got a last name, Charlie, or is this a Madonna-type deal? 
 She'll know who I am. 
 Tell her it's been a while. 
 Hear anything more about Pulpo getting pulled out? 
 Apparently he's got an unreasonable list of demands before he agrees to cooperate. 
 Yeah, well, he's safer in prison. 
 Hey. 
 We got a rat in here, bro. 
 [Sighs] 
 What did you think was gonna happen when you got this unit? 
 They'd just leave you alone; With your history? 
 I didn't think they'd be so obvious about it. 
 [Electronic beeping] 
 Go for Voight. 
 It's Perry. Gustav Munoz is back. 
 He struck again across town. 
 This was Munoz. 
 We got proof of it upstairs. 
 Moving a lot of dope out of here. 
 Hey, fellas. Found a misfired bullet. 
 It's a .22 hollow point, same as we found at the two-three stash house. 
 Crime lab did a rush on the prints. 
 It's a match for Gustav Munoz. 
 Where are we finding this guy? 
 Well, we got his face everywhere. 
 ICE, anti-crime... every department is looking for him. 
 Look, I thought this guy was just a hired assassin. 
 Not quite, Commander. 
 Munoz is going for a full-on power grab. 
 He wants to wear that crown. 
 I thought Munoz was working for Pulpo; yes or no? 
 Yes. 
 Commander, Pulpo has agreed to cooperate with us fully. 
 We can ask him about Munoz, what his habits are, what his behavior patterns are. 
 So why is he still in prison? 
 Because he has a lot demands he keeps adding on... 
 Look, make the deal! 
 Look around you! 
 We already waited too long. 
 Now anybody else still think it's a bad idea to work with Pulpo, raise your hand so I can see who to punch in the mouth. 
 I think it's insanity. 
 You run this operation. 
 You are gonna make sure that Pulpo gets in and out of prison safe, you understand that? 
 And you gonna keep your head on straight or you gonna take some vacation time. 
 Either way is fine with me. 
 I know emotions are high. 
 Pulpo and his men cost us one of our own, nearly cost us a family member, but if you got into this profession expecting not to deal with scumbags, you got into the wrong line of work. 
 Go ahead. 
 Listen... this is us doing our job. 
 [Exhales] 
 Antonio. 
 Ah, yes. Gustav Munoz. 
 "Bad, bad, bad person." Ha. 
 It'll be good to get him off the streets. 
 Where is he? 
 Ah, business first. 
 I need to make sure my deal is done. 
 After that, I'm at your service. 
 I want to see what you're giving him. 
 Out of solitary, money to his commissary account, extra yard time... 
 It's all right. 
 Conjugal visits? 
 Has he got a girl on the side? 
 Find out. 
 We can use whatever leverage we can get. 
 Yeah, okay. I know just the guy. 
 He's a hacker I busted a year ago. 
 He's under house arrest. 
 Perfect. Go. 
 Munoz. 
 As you may know, I'm still a criminal, a shot caller... yes?... to the eyes of the people in prison, which is why the idea of pulling me out for a fake surgery was so smart. 
 Thanks for that, Lieutenant Belden. 
 How do you say in English what I'm getting removed? 
 Gallbladder. 
 Ah! 
 Yes. Vesicula biliar in espanol... 
 Hey! Hey! Hey! 
 Munoz. 
 Right now. 
 Of course. Um... 
 I'm gonna need a cell phone, por favor. 
 Leave it alone. 
 I don't know. 
 Everyone in Intelligence is gonna think I'm some pie-eyed little girl who can't control her crushes. 
 Naw. Ruzek was playing where he shouldn't have. 
 It wasn't his fault. 
 Sarge, can we get some keys? 
 Let's go. 
 Hey, Lindsay. 
 Somebody stopped by for you today. 
 Yeah? 
 Said his name was Charlie. 
 Kind of hot. 
 Smelled like cigarettes and Drakkar. 
 Said he knew you from a long time ago. 
 You coming? 
 So who's Charlie? 
 He's a... he's a guy I used to run with. 
 Run with or run from? 
 I got it handled. 
 What's up, Johnny? 
 [Groans from computer] 
 This is Detective Lindsay. 
 How's it going? 
 I haven't done anything, Detective. 
 Good lord... 
 [Man grunts] 
 I thought you were working with a therapist for that. 
 I relapse sometimes. 
 He started by hacking into p0rn sites... 
 Clearly. 
 And that became government databases. 
 It was just to... to see if I could do it. 
 Mm-hmm, yup. 
 We're looking for a guy named Pulpo. 
 His real name is Adres Dias. 
 Do one of your algorithms. 
 We're looking for something everyone missed. 
 Go. That'd be a violation of the conditions of my parole. 
 Shh. 
 Okay. 
 But I want my own guy. 
 Because I said so. 
 His name is Tico. He can be trusted. 
 Okay. Hey, I got to go. 
 Guards are gonna come soon, and I gotta hide the phone. 
 Bueno. 
 [Speaking Spanish] 
 Who's this Tico you're sending over? 
 You. 
 This program I built will cross-reference NSA, FBI, CIA, and DHS databases. 
 Adres "Pulpo" Dias. 
 There are several phones I can link to him. 
 He called this one home on Chicago's south side 144 times earlier this year. 
 Right before he got pinched by Intelligence. 
 Get me that address. 
 The Latin discount plazas. 
 At any given time, a tractor trailer full of drugs is being dropped off at one of these 30 malls. 
 The police never knows which one. 
 Neither do the traffickers. 
 That way if anybody gets arrested, nobody can lead the cops back to the bosses. 
 Oh, but my connection knows, and he says there's a shipment coming from Indiana today, and so here we go... 
 Antonio goes to meet my guy. 
 El Vaquero... the cowboy, if you will. 
 El vaquero will give you the truck to drive. 
 At the pick up will be Marcos Robles. 
 Robles is a high-level capo who's in charge of these drugs, and it will be there,  Damas y Caballeros,  where Gustav Munoz will be to get his cut. 
 [Snapping] Easy as uno, dos, tres. 
 Hey, come here. 
 All the names match, so... pretty long sheets, especially with Robles. 
 All Colombian descent, so pretty legit. 
 You up for this? 
 I can pull another cop to go undercover. 
 I'll do it. 
 Yeah? 
 How's your Spanish? 
 No bueno. 
 Munoz knows what you look like. 
 You two went to fisticuffs. 
 I'm doing it. 
 That way if it goes south, I have an excuse to break Pulpo's neck. 
 This goes any different than uno, dos, tres... 
 No need to finish your threat, okay? 
 I completely understand the situation I'm in. 
 Antonio. 
 When you see the cowboy, tell him that Pulpo says Happy Birthday, then he'll know you're good. 
 [Mariachi music playing] 
 ♪ ♪ 
 ¿Que pasa? 
 I'm Tico. 
 Pulpo says Happy Birthday. 
 I've never seen you before. 
 Now you have. 
 Open your shirt. 
 Open your shirt. 
 Take it easy. 
 Open it. 
 Open your shirt. 
 All right, get ready to move in. 
 Are you out of your mind? 
 Are you out of your mind? 
 I don't know who you are, and all you got is a name. 
 I'm the cousin of the guy who's on Pulpo's tier at Stateville. 
 The one who gives him protection. 
 How 'bout I tell my cousin you pulled a gun on me, and as soon as Pulpo's back from the hospital, he slits his throat, and guess whose throat is next? 
 I'm sorry. 
 You damn well better be. 
 Entonces... ¿estamos bien? 
 Si. [Laughing] Okay. So now what? Antonio Dawson, baby. Again, I'm sorry. Don't sweat it. Wheels up. Lina Ochoa? Yes? Detectives Lindsay and Halstead. We have a couple questions to ask you. What about? You know someone by the name of Adres Dias, goes by Pulpo? Oh, God, don't remind me. How do you know him? We met in a club once. I made the mistake of being nice to him. We noticed that he called you a lot, like, 144 times. Yeah, 'cause he's crazy. I would've taken out a restraining order against him if I didn't think he'd kill me. Have you had any contact with him recently? Hell no. Don't tell me he's out. No. No, we're just checking. Good. Let him rot in prison. Okay. Thank you for your time. Mama? Good luck. Cute kid. [Background chatter] [Speaking Spanish] Keys. [Crunch] You stay here. I got an eye on Robles. Black hat, black leather jacket with a hoodie. No sign of Munoz though. He's on the move. Hey, you stay here with me. All right, Robles is leaving in the rig. Follow him. Copy. Hey, quit beating yourself up. Nobody's gonna judge you. It's birds and bees. Who cares? You're right. Yeah, I just... I got to get back on the horse. That's what I got to do. Yes. Yeah. There you go. And I got plenty of guys I could set you up with. Okay, as long as they have a job. You know what? No, I don't care. I just... I got to go on a date. As long as I don't have to buy dinner. You know what? I'll buy dinner. Police radio : We have a call of persons down. Respond to Kiev Sauna, 1916. [Siren wailing] [Low chatter in Spanish] Freeze! Chicago PD! Get your hands up! Turn around! On the ground! Turn around! [Overlapping yelling] Turn around! You hear me? Get down! Gun! [Gunshots] [Grunting] Put your hand down. Where's Munoz? They just walk in here and start shooting. Look familiar? The bullet type, point-blank shots to the head. Did you see the shooters? They didn't see me. Was he one of them? Gustav Munoz, he on his way? Munoz? Why would he be here? For his cut. Don't act stupid with me. I'm not playing around. If I saw Gustav Munoz, I'd strangle him. He'd try and do the same to me. He's not here. Guys. Two high-ranking Ukrainian mobsters were just killed in a bathhouse across town execution-style. Witness I.D.'d Munoz as the shooter. Don't tell me we just got worked by Pulpo. ¿Que Paso? No Munoz? He was never gonna be there, and you know it. You sent us on a goose chase to take out your rival faction within the cartel. What? Nah, nah, nah, nah. That is... that's crazy. I thought Munoz was gonna be there, I promise. But even so, lieutenant Belden here told me you removed at least 100 kilos of cocaine from the street, recovered illegal weapons, and hundreds of thousands of dollars in drug money. I mean, all in all, not a wasted trip, yes? Which I believe, uh... is worth a new TV for me. Part of our side deal. Wasn't in the paperwork. Get out. Turn it down a notch, Voight. Get out or I will throw your ass out. 
 
 Hey, hey! Hey, guys, come on! Calm down, Voight! Stop... hey! Knock it off. Let it go. Commander, let me run point now. Pulpo doesn't trust these two as far as he can throw 'em. Commander, you wanted this lunatic out. Here he is. He has been playing us. He will continue to play us till he is hanging off a ledge. Give me ten minutes alone with him. Ten minutes. You know I can't. Not now! We got something. This is Pulpo's baby mama and son, Osberto. She here 'cause she wants to be here? No. We leaned on her. She's got a failure to appear off a DUI. Maybe played up possible jail time. You watch the kid. Can you come with me, please, ma'am? Looks like it's just gonna be me and you for a while, little buddy. Is my mom in trouble? [Sighs] There's a bad man, and we're trying to stop him from doing more bad things, and your mom's helping us. Okay. Okay? It's all right. Okay? Oh. Adres? Hey, it's okay, baby. Everything's gonna be okay. Be a shame for your kid to grow up with a mother in prison. The system isn't good for any child. You can't do that. You took my son. I have no problem taking yours. Adres, please don't let them take our baby away. Hey, it's okay. Hey. Leave her and my son alone and I'll tell you Munoz's next target. Well, if your information's good, maybe we can work something out, but this is your last shot. I understand. Mm-hmm. All I need before I tell you is to see my new deal that states that Lina and my son will be free from prosecution... Adres! Belden, I need to see it in writing! Belden! Hey! Hey, okay! Okay! Okay. Okay, what? Munoz. He's gonna be at the Festival de l'Ascension. You've heard of it, right, Antonio? It's at the Aragon ballroom. It starts tomorrow. That's right. There's this man from New York. He's a high-level man. His name is Francisco Heredia. Munoz knows he'll be at the festival, and Munoz will be there to kill him. This is the final piece of the rompecabezas for Munoz. It's a real bitch getting into the foster care system at five years old. I've investigated a lot of these cases. The thing is, you just never know what happens to some of these kids until years later. I promise you this is the truth. How do you know for sure Heredia will be there? It's the birthday of his twin girls. They were born here, and he's very superstitious. Every year he, his wife, and his twin girls go to first day of the festival. Once Heredia dies... [Whistles] Munoz and his men will have sole control over the cartel. Tell everyone to be here at 8:00 A.M. Let's go. Voight, I want to see my son now. No. Please! Belden! We catch Munoz, you can see your son. You have my word. 8:00 A.M. be suited up and ready to go. And we believe Pulpo? What is it Jay likes to say? He's the best of a lot of bad options. So we're just supposed to take his word for it even after he lied... [bangs desk] You think I want to be dealing with this prick? Every day I look across the desk and I see a chair where my partner used to sit, and she ain't here because of him. [Cell phone buzzing] Hey, baby. Hey. What's wrong? [Sniffles] Um... Come here. In here. I've been trying to call you. Yeah, I'm sorry. I've been swamped with this case. It's gonna get like this sometimes. I think I'm gonna stay with my folks for a little bit. [Sniffles] What's going on? Adam, this isn't the place to have this conversation, but I never know when I'm gonna see you. You're not the same as when you went into the academy, and something about this unit has changed you. Atwater, hey. You seen Burgess? Why? What do you mean "why"? Just leave her alone, man. You need to mind your own business. Listen, I don't care that you work upstairs. I don't care that you outrank me. You messing with her head too much. So either you leave her alone, or me and you gonna have to get into it. All right, man, you got it. Fair enough. Oh, thank you. Erin. Charlie. I'm back. Uh... I'll, uh... I'll see you tomorrow. You sure? Yeah. Okay. I'm good. No hug? Come on. Come on. All right. Okay, where's the badge? I'm not gonna believe it till I see the badge. Come on. I still don't believe it. It's funny how life works out, huh? You're not supposed to be in Chicago, Charlie. It's been long enough. I missed everybody, missed you, and, uh... well, I don't need to explain myself. I wanted to come back. You still in touch with Annie? Yeah, I am. Yeah, I been looking for her too. You got her number? You got to let me talk to her first. You gonna be like that? Come on. Give me a break. I have your number, Charlie. I'll be in touch. I'm proud of you, girl. I'm serious. You made it out. Thanks. You're safe. [Knock on door] Hey. Hey. How's work? Great. Voight thinks I'm a rat. Couldn't be better. Just prove to him that you're not. [Chuckles] I've been trying. I have a couple hours. We talked about this. I'm looking for my own place right now. I swear. And we're gonna tell the kids soon. Okay, well, when that happens... Mia, we're gonna be together. You must believe that. Don't do this for me, please, because she is gonna take you for everything that you have. I've got it all worked out. Let me know when you do. Okay. I've figured out a way to make you worth my time and effort. Well, that's great. 25%... Everything that you take off the street. Well, it doesn't look like I have much of a choice, so... All right. If you try to screw me or shortchange me or set me up, I have five bear traps set, and you will not make it out alive. I get it. Francisco Heredia. Get a good look at him. Now we obviously want Munoz first before any shots are fired. Getting Heredia in custody is a secondary objective. It's gonna be a big crowd, lots of moving parts, so keep your eyes and ears open. All right. Hey, Jin, come here. Hey. I was out of line last night. No, you weren't, man. Come here. I love you. Hey, hey, hey, hey. You got to tell me you love me back, otherwise I look like an idiot. Come on, man. I love you too, Alvin. All right? Yeah. Thanks. Is that good? What's up? We got I.A. sniffing around here lately. I want you to keep an eye on Sumner for me. You get anything that shows that she's a pipeline, I want to hear about. You got it. That's it. [Background noise, chatter] [Bell dings] [Bell ringing] Heredia just arrived. Keep your eye on the florist on stage near the statue. Gun. [Gunshots] Shots fired! Shots fired! [Woman screaming] There is no way that he got both guards! Any visual on the second muzzle flash? Alvin, Halstead, you got this guy? Target ducked down. He's out of sight. Can't get a lock. No clear shot. [Screaming] Aah! Come on. Come over here. Come on. Stay down! Get down. Get down. Get down. Find Munoz! I have eyes on Munoz! Move, move, move, move! Do you have the shot? Negative. He's blocked from this position. Come on. Come on. I have Munoz. Fire. [Screaming] Come on, come on, move, move! [Crowd commotion] You got it, Commander. Well, I will pass it along. That was Commander Perry. He wants to know why shots had to be fired. So much for "nice job." The day Perry says that, I will take everyone out for karaoke. Ha. I'd pay to see that. What are you gonna sing, boss? My way. You were expecting love shack? I don't know. [Laughs] [Speaking Spanish] ¿Si, Antonio? I want him out of here. Hey, we had a deal! I get to hold Lina and my son before I go. Get him out of here now. I made a deal. I keep my word. What's up? So I need to keep this quick or Voight's gonna wonder where I am. You're doing great, but right now, more than ever, I need you to stay on top of Voight's phone calls, his emails, his whereabouts, everything. I want a full work-up on him to be conveyed in a comprehensive report that goes to me and only to me every Friday. Yeah. Okay. How's your father doing? Better, thanks. I'm glad I could help with that. Can I go now? Sure. Come on. Let's make it quick. There's nothing like being a father, is there, Antonio? Te quiero, hijo. [Speaking Spanish] Mi amor. All right, that's enough. Te quiero, mi amor. You wanted to see me? What's Charlie Pugliese doing back in town? I don't know, but I will handle it. The deal was, I take you in, he stays out of Illinois. Like I said, I will handle it. Don't go backward, Erin. [Gunshots] We got officers down! You see anything? No. Nothing. I'll go left. No visual. Antonio's down! Hank? Somebody call an ambulance! 10-1, squad! Officer shot, 21st district at the roll up! Come on. Come on!
