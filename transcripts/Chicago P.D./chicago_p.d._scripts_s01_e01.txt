 I don't know where I'm going. 
 Just keep driving. 
 How am I supposed to hold the wheel like this? 
 I can barely steer. 
 You're doing fine. 
 Voight, there's got to be a deal we can make. 
 Pull over up here. 
 Ow! 
 [Whimpering] 
 Come on, let's go. 
 [Screams] 
 Let's go. 
 [Screaming] 
 This is 4 grand, if you just let me... 
 Just let me go. 
 Shut up. Come here. 
 I got three dead kids who OD'd, so I'm asking one more time. 
 Who's putting out the bad dope? 
 I told you! [Grunts] 
 [Grunts] 
 [Groaning] 
 [Sobbing] 
 The name. A name! 
 Rev. His name is Rev. 
 He deals out of an apartment on South Emerald. 
 [Sobbing] Oh, oh. 
 Look at me. 
 See that? 
 You ever cross that line, the next trip you take will be to the bottom of the river. 
 Stay out of my city. 
 Bus fare. 
 [Girl giggling] 
 Who's excited for school today? 
 Knock, knock. 
 Not me. 
 Who's there? 
 Okay, photo day for Liam. 
 Hey, that's not fair. 
 Classroom fund for Emmy. 
 Knock, knock. 
 Who is there? 
 Which one's Emmy? 
 Emmy? 
 Hello, dad! 
 Emmy? 
 It's me! 
 [Laughs] 
 Got it. Got it. 
 Keep reminding me, sweetie. 
 Knock, knock. 
 Who's there? 
 Bet you're glad I didn't say banana. 
 Close enough, baby. 
 What's up, Willhites? 
 Hey. 
 Million-dollar spaghetti tonight. 
 See you guys. 
 Oh, you're all sweaty. 
 Looks like you just went to the gym. 
 I won't tell you I just came from the gym. 
 You're gross. Get away from me. 
 I told you... I can get you a 20% cop discount on a year membership. 
 Morning, sunshine. 
 Funny. 
 It's not the money. It's the time. 
 I got to take furlough just to get my hair cut. 
 [Keypad beeping] 
 That stuff will kill ya now, apparently. 
 Saw an article online. 
 Well, that is last on the very long list of things that I'm concerned about. 
 Please. 
 Caitlin was asking about you. 
 Oh, yeah. Tell her I say hi. 
 So no interest on your part? 
 She's super sweet, but my loss. 
 Hey, you guys seen Voight around? 
 No. Why? 
 Nothing. 
 You... I am never setting you up again. 
 What? Why not? 
 Because you don't know a good thing when you see it. 
 Got a name on that dealer. 
 Good. Get him off the street. 
 Watch me. 
 Hey, hold up. 
 Sir. 
 Come on in. Close the door. 
 I'm just trying to do the math here. 
 A few months ago, you work out a deal, get yourself out of jail, and somehow, you land the biggest job in the city... running an Intelligence Unit in my district. 
 Yeah, things worked out. 
 I tell ya... I got no choice to admit that, somehow, you are connected upstairs in ways that I do not understand. 
 Hmm. 
 But, Sergeant... 
 Why the hell is a woman named Gradishar from Internal Affairs calling me up about you? 
 You say Gradishar? 
 Never heard of her. 
 If you're still running game out on the street, cowboy, being a dirty cop, I will personally throw you off a roof. 
 Commander. 
 Atwater, Burgess. 
 Yes, Sergeant. 
 Need you today. 
 You got it. 
 Sergeant. 
 What? 
 Pods showed me something off the side of the road today... confrontation off the Dan Ryan. 
 It was on camera? 
 It was on camera. 
 Go. 
 But not any longer? 
 No. 
 I can live with that. 
 All right, listen up. 
 Got a name on those dope deaths. 
 It's a dealer named Rev on South Emerald. 
 As soon as Olinsky gets here, we're gonna... 
 Over here. 
 Hey. 
 Hey, Alvin. 
 Hank. 
 We're gonna set up a controlled buy... 
 Halstead and Lindsay in the doorway. 
 Do not go inside. 
 Got it. 
 All right, one more thing... we've been doing this, what, two months? 
 Now more than ever, we keep everything in house. 
 Understand? 
 I don't care how they run other departments or how you came up. 
 This is Intelligence... my unit. 
 You tell me the truth, so I can lie for you. 
 And if you ever go over my head, it'll be the last head you go over. 
 Everybody goes home tonight. 
 You want to know how you can tell when a nickname sticks? 
 Ten years ago, the corner boys on 16th street started calling me Pulpo, the Octopus. 
 Why? 
 Because I had my hands everywhere. 
 A drop on Fullerton, a couple of soldiers in Humboldt Park... 
 I handled it. 
 I started hearing the name Pulpo everywhere, from street dealers' mouths to whores' lips. 
 [Chuckles] 
 You want to know what they call you behind your back? 
 Chismoso,  because your tongue is always flapping when it shouldn't be... which is why I'm here. 
 [Inhales deeply] 
 Ahh. 
 Acabemos con esto. 
 [Shouting] 
 [Coughs] 
 [Gasping] 
 [Screams] 
 Rev! Open up! 
 Hey! You mind keeping it down? 
 Am I banging on your door? No? 
 Then go back inside. 
 Rev, open up! 
 I'm going out on a limb here. Rev might not be home. 
 Come on, man! 
 What? 
 Yeah, uh, is Rev here? 
 No, so quit pounding on the door. 
 Hey, man, yo, my girl... she's going into rehab tomorrow. 
 Wants to go out with a bang tonight. 
 Rev usually hooks me up. 
 You ever been to rehab, man? It sucks. 
 Come in. 
 We'll come back when Rev's here. 
 You've been up my ass for two hours about scoring some "H". 
 Well, I changed my mind! 
 Mujeres, right? 
 It looked like blood. 
 That and the fact that we don't know that guy... 
 You don't have to justify it. 
 You got a bad hit, you got a bad hit. 
 Let's go in. 
 No. 'Cause maybe it looked like blood? 
 That's not probable cause to force an entry. 
 He could have been marinating a chicken and spilled barbecue sauce on his pants. 
 We've got three O.D.s traced back to the heroin Rev's moving. 
 You want to wait for another kid to die? 
 We'll do a knock-and-talk, all right? 
 Whoever's in control of the apartment gets all squirrelly, we'll take it from there. 
 All right? 
 We're going back up. 
 Stand by. 
 Tucked in and ready to go, boss. 
 Barbecue sauce as a marinade? 
 What's that... some kind of Puerto Rican thing or something? 
 I'm Dominican. 
 It's got too much sugar in it. It'll burn the meat. 
 [Gunshots] 
 10-1! Shots fired at the police! 
 10-1, 5600 Emerald! 
 Plainclothes officers at the scene! 
 Get the long guns! 
 [Siren wailing] 
 Get back inside! Go back upstairs! 
 All right, man. 
 Police! Clear! 
 Clear! 
 Body! 
 That's Rev in the john. 
 Offender must have booked. 
 Call it in. Clear the rest of the building. 
 Shooter's in the wind. 
 [Thump] 
 Take him upstairs. 
 Beheading... 
 That's a signature cartel move. 
 Yeah. 
 Lindsay, put together a description of the guy who answered the door, see if you can find him in any of our databases. 
 Hey, is your transmitter all right? 
 It cut out. 
 Oh, yeah. 
 Uh, banged up against the wall. 
 I'm sorry, Jin. 
 Alvin, I'm gonna need a fresh face in case we have someone pose as a buyer again. 
 I'll pull someone from the academy. 
 I owe you one. 
 That's why you have backup. 
 Hey, Platt, anything on the shooter? 
 Still doing a grid search, brought in the helicopter... nothing yet. 
 Lieutenant Belden from Violent Crimes is looking for you. 
 Hey, Burgess. Burgess? 
 Yeah. 
 Come here. 
 I got a job for you. 
 Hit the morgue. 
 D.O.A. was brought in today named Ross Herrfeldt. 
 He's my cousin. 
 Oh, I'm sorry to hear that. 
 Thanks. 
 He's got a diamond pinkie ring on his left hand. 
 I want you to get it for me. 
 Ask for a guy named Dave Bulhack down there. 
 Tell him I sent ya. It'll be fine. 
 I don't... 
 It shouldn't be a problem. 
 It's got a lot of sentimental value. 
 I need to get it before the hyena in-laws move in. 
 So go. Take the thing and go. 
 Go, go, go. 
 And how old is the kid? 
 13. 
 You can't interview him without parental consent. 
 Dad's dead. Mom's in jail. 
 I notified D.C.F.S. 
 And they said what? 
 I left a message. 
 You know, running around half-cocked in a gang unit is one thing, but being the boss of an Intelligence Unit is another matter entirely. 
 I run my squad as I see fit, Lieutenant. 
 You do your detective work how you want. 
 This is a joint investigation, Sergeant. 
 We share all information. 
 I was gonna come to you. 
 Nah, we're a block and a half away. 
 My turn to walk the mutt, besides. 
 So, look, I got a business proposition for you. 
 Yeah, huh? 
 Yeah. 
 I throw these full-package-type parties... 
 DJ, games, the whole deal. 
 Got a pretty steady crowd. They follow me. 
 Only problem is, my venue fell through, and I'm thinking, how about Molly's? 
 Beheaded? 
 Yeah, you believe that? 
 So you can have the whole bar, and me and you can split the door. 
 Whoa, wait. Who got beheaded? 
 Oh, some dealer. 
 I'll take care of all the promotions, and I'll provide security at the front. 
 Uh, it sounds complicated, but, yeah. 
 Just give me a flat $200, and you can invite who you want. 
 Done. 
 All right. 
 Come on, Pouch! Come on! 
 [Whistles] 
 I heard Rev was looking for a runner... you know, get his lunch and smokes and lottery tickets and stuff. 
 So I went over there to see if I could get the job. 
 Someone knocked on the door. 
 He went out of the room. I heard yelling. 
 And that's when I ducked into that closet. 
 You're in our gang database, D'Anthony. 
 We know you were in the same crew as Rev. 
 Did he piss someone off? 
 Was someone moving in on his action? 
 You see what happened to Rev? 
 No. 
 I heard it. 
 Are you okay? 
 Yeah, I'm fine. 
 What all did you hear? 
 There were three of them. 
 Did you get a good look at them? 
 No, I hid as soon as I heard yelling. 
 What were they saying? 
 I don't know. Most of it was in Spanish. 
 How about a name? 
 I don't know if it was a name, but Rev kept yelling out "Pulpo." 
 Can't be the same Pulpo. 
 That's him. 
 Adres Dias, aka Pulpo, the Octopus. 
 He's got dual citizenship here and Colombia. 
 Me and Jules had him on our radar five years back when he was working his way up from street enforcer. 
 Yeah, I remember his name. 
 Didn't he beat a double-murder rap? 
 The two key witnesses were killed. 
 Was he cutting off heads back then too? 
 No, he learned a thing or two since he was in Colombia. 
 Oh. 
 What type of player was he? 
 What part of the city did he hold down? 
 Oh, see, that's the thing. 
 He wasn't affiliated with any faction. 
 Nobody knew his real script. 
 He was just in it for the money and the blood. 
 Okay, you two, in my office. 
 You ever heard the expression "10% percent of the cops do 90% of the work"? 
 I have. 
 Well, this Intelligence Unit is part of the 10%. 
 With that said, I appreciate your aggressiveness, but you were instructed to do an undercover buy in the doorway. 
 I never told you to cross the threshold. 
 If you had, you and Lindsay might not have gotten out of there alive. 
 You vouched for him. Keep him in line. 
 Let's go for a ride. 
 Who do you have? 
 Gibson... 
 Hands down the best cadet we got... super dedicated, no back talk, no ball breaking, aced the marksmanship. 
 You need him when he's finished with the academy? 
 I needed him five minutes ago. 
 All right. 
 You want to kill yourself? 
 You know what? I'll do it. 
 I'll blow your brains out, huh? 
 Huh? What do you think about that? 
 What the hell are you doing? 
 You said the goal was to get the gun out of his hands. 
 We'll take him. 
 Hey, I got a couple of C.I.s I can reach out to, see if they know anything about Pulpo. 
 Good. 
 Is that who we're going to see, a C.I. of yours? 
 Basically. 
 What the hell does that mean? 
 Either they are or they aren't. 
 I got big plans for you. 
 Ah! 
 Stay here. 
 That's your big plan... for me to stay in the car? 
 What'd you bring me for, then? 
 You cheer me up. 
 Yay. 
 [Clears throat] What's up, Maurice? 
 Let me guess... 
 Rev. 
 Wannabe shot callers, man. 
 These fools want to grind it up to sixth gear before they even know how to drive. 
 He got in bed with a cartel? 
 Colombians. 
 The name Pulpo mean anything to you? 
 No. 
 Who in Rev's posse might know something? 
 He subcontracted the transport... some white dude named Coop. 
 That a first or last name? 
 Look it up. 
 What, I got to do everything for you? 
 I'm gonna need you in a couple weeks. 
 Direct some traffic for me. 
 You'll wait to hear from me is what you'll do. 
 What's the matter with you? 
 [Knock at door] 
 Eric Cooper! 
 Hey, Coop, open up! 
 Pry marks. 
 Breach. 
 Police! 
 Clear! 
 Clear! 
 Police! 
 Clear! 
 The next head I see better be Pulpo's. 
 Hi. Um, is Dave Bulhack here? 
 He went home sick. 
 Oh, okay. 
 Um, Sergeant Platt from the 21st sent me. 
 Oh, that witch? What does she need? 
 Well, a D.O.A. was brought in named Ross Herrfeldt, and we didn't get the proper identifiers on him. 
 I need to take some photos, so we can cross-match. 
 Ok... um, this is embarrassing, but do you have a barf bag or something? 
 I got hit with a wave here. 
 Sorry. 
 Just wait here. 
 Hey, come here. 
 Adam Ruzek, this is Sergeant Voight. 
 Hey, boss. Nice to meet you, sir. 
 Ruzek... I know that name. 
 Yeah, my dad, Bob, was a patrolman his whole career in the 26th. 
 You don't say. 
 I pulled him out of the academy, not his old man. 
 What, did you work with my dad? 
 Yeah, we were on the same... 
 Softball. 
 Softball team together. 
 We designed T-shirts, if I'm not mistaken. 
 Yeah, boy, there's some good living up in Beverly. 
 That's where you were raised, right? 
 I split time with my dad there and my mom up in Canaryville. 
 If D'Anthony was right, and he heard three voices in the apartment, Pulpo must have brought two hit men with him from Medellin. 
 All right, just get all this information to Lieutenant Belden in Violent Crimes. 
 Hey, have we gotten anything from his end? 
 Nothing. 
 Calls between Rev and Coop yesterday... only one other number called 'em both. 
 It's a pay-as-you-go drop phone, signal's off, but it was purchased at a cell store in Greektown. 
 Take Halstead. Check it out. 
 Hey, I want the Canaryville out of you, not the Beverly, huh? 
 You got it, boss. Yeah. 
 Hey. 
 Hey, man. Adam Ruzek. 
 Antonio. 
 Jules. Welcome. 
 How long have we worked together... a month? 
 I think it's time we could be honest with each other. 
 Wouldn't you agree? 
 No. Two things... 
 One, you driving all the time, I'm not down with that. 
 Seniority rules. 
 I've been on the job longer. 
 I've been in this unit longer. 
 Okay, look, I feel like a househusband. 
 Aw. 
 What's the second thing? 
 What's the deal with you and Voight? 
 [Sighs] 
 [Seat belt unbuckles] 
 This stays between us. 
 Of course. 
 We went to prom together. 
 [Chuckles] 
 I mean, is he your secret dad or something? 
 Put it this way... if I were to ask you out, would I have to get his permission first? 
 Any guy who needs to ask my dad's permission to date me should save himself the trouble. 
 Uh! Shake it, baby. 
 Watch yourself. 
 Yes, sir, officer, sir. 
 
 
 
 [Bell jingles] 
 A pay-as-you-go phone was purchased from your store in the last 24 hours. 
 We're looking for who bought it. 
 Yeah. 
 A Juan Garcia yesterday, paid cash. 
 Any other information you can provide us? 
 No. We're not responsible for background checks. 
 True, but it is a fairly common name. 
 You know, there's not a lot we can do with that. 
 Yeah. 
 You don't tell me how to do my job. 
 I don't tell you how to do yours. 
 You're Glen Pearson, right... the owner of this place? 
 That's right. 
 You know, it looks like there's a Glen Pearson with a deceptive practice and fraud charge for selling stolen merchandise out of Gary, Indiana. 
 Oh? 
 That's a $25,000 extraditable must-hold warrant. 
 Oy. 
 What do you think... height, weight match, eye color too? 
 Yeah, but I don't know. I hate to jump to conclusions. 
 You know what? I got an idea. 
 Why don't we throw some bracelets on him? 
 We'll take him down to the station, run his prints, and then we can be sure. 
 I got a nanny cam up here. 
 I can pull some footage, get a picture of the guy who did it... that's the best I can do. 
 Oh. That's great. 
 Great, yeah. You're too kind. 
 Knew that would work. 
 Mm-hmm. 
 Just got to figure out who this idiot is. 
 Why don't you bring that ass over to my place sometime, girl? 
 I'll let you in. 
 [Scoffs] Oh, let it go. 
 Uh-huh. 
 Uh-huh. 
 Hey, come here a sec. 
 No, you're just trying to get me with assaulting a police officer. 
 Do you see a badge on me? 
 Mm. 
 [Groans] 
 Anybody else? 
 My hero. 
 You're still not driving. 
 Again, I'm sorry for your loss, Sergeant. 
 Yeah, he was a deadbeat. 
 I loaned him 500 bucks for an above-ground pool he put in two years ago. 
 Guess how much I got back. 
 I don't know. 
 Guess. 
 Nothing? 
 That's right. 
 So Julio's pawnshop on West Cermak... 
 Ugh. It'll be closed by the time you get there. 
 So tomorrow ask for Julio. 
 Do not deal with his wife, 'cause she'll dick you down. 
 I want $350 for this thing, minimum. 
 Okay, yeah, yeah, Julio's. 
 Got it. 
 Colombian authorities I.D.'D this guy as Omar Rojas, freelance hit man. 
 So Rev was the boss. Coop moved the merchandise. 
 Who's the next in the chain of command? 
 Well, that was the problem. 
 Rev was only in town from Baton Rouge for a year. 
 There was no structure to his crew. 
 And nobody's talking? 
 Nope. 
 All right. When Olinsky gets in, you tell... 
 I'm right here. 
 Anything from your C.I.s? 
 No dice... something about not wanting to have their heads chopped off. 
 All right, get Rojas' image out there with Pulpo's citywide... all airports, train, bus stations, and keep hitting the bushes. 
 You want to brief me on any new developments? 
 I was about to ask you the same thing. 
 If we came up with something, you'd be the first to know. 
 This ain't about who takes credit. 
 End of the day, you can stand in front of the cameras. 
 But this is supposed to be a joint investigation... your words. 
 We haven't heard dick from you or any of your detectives working this case. 
 Okay, I'll double-check on that. 
 Now, what's with the 13-year-old kid? 
 Still here. 
 He give you anything? 
 Enough. 
 Okay, then kick him. 
 No, that's been handled, Lieutenant. 
 Commander Perry has given me another day till we get the offenders into custody. 
 It's for the kid's own safety. 
 The law's the law, Voight. 
 I'm sure you left that part out when you were doing a soft shoe for your commander. 
 I'm telling you, based on my conversation with Deputy Chief Hammond, if you're not gonna charge this kid, then notify his relatives and have 'em come and pick him up. 
 And the fact that I'm here, once again, explaining to you basic police protocol is a prime example why people are reluctant to bring you into the loop during these type of heater cases. 
 Your cousin Renny's coming to pick you up. 
 Now? 
 Copy that. 
 Come here. 
 You know, I basically look people in the eye for a living. 
 You have a future beyond this neighborhood, D'Anthony. 
 It's okay to want that. 
 When you start to try and get out, whenever that is, you call me. 
 [Horn honks] 
 Let's go! 
 Hey. What's up, man? 
 Hey! 
 What's going on? We had to pay full cover at the door. I'm running a business, Detective. Atwater is the cheapest, I mean the cheapest guy you will ever meet. We drove... wait for it... we drove around for a half hour yesterday looking for an ATM that wouldn't charge him a withdrawal fee. And there's a two-drink minimum, so start knocking 'em back. I ain't playing. Okay, then I want mine in that cup. Next time. Flight attendant. Uh, yeah, three years, waiting until I got into the police academy. Flight attendant? You can break my balls all you want, but I learned more about crowd control and conflict resolution and intimidation tactics... traits that will serve me well when you guys detail me up into Intelligence. Hint, hint. Oh. Oh. Wow. Okay. Noted. Thanks. How about you? Oh, I just kicked around... nothing glamorous. You? I was in the military. You see any action? I did. Yeah. Ever see anything like you did today? I'm sorry. I... forget I asked that. That was a stupid question. All right. Let's do this again. All right. 200 bucks? Wow! You realize if you split the money at the door, we would have made five times as much? Yep. [Phone vibrates] [Sighs] Hello? Where are you? [Dogs barking in the distance] [Grunting softly] What happened? They got pissed at me for hiding in the closet... said I should have backed Rev up. I want to get out. [Crying] Come on. [Claps hands] Hey. You working double-time now? Hey, dad. Hey, baby. Hey, baby. Oh, he loves it here. A little too much maybe. It's fine. I got to get him into boxing, right? When he's ten. We talked about this. Where's Eva? Volleyball. Then she's got a sleepover at a friend's. Oh. All right. Got to get back to work. Hey, hey, hey. Wait, wait, wait. Wait, wait. What about dinner tonight? Something jumped off. Do you remember Pulpo? Yeah, that means shark, right? Octopus. Girl, you got to work on your Spanish. Okay, sure, in all that free time I have. Yeah, well, he's back in town. Hey, come here. You're the best. You're better. So how would this work... you getting me out and all? Leave that to me. And it may take a couple days. I just need you to stay alive till then. What's in it for you? You're a good kid. I don't got to work it off... like be a snitch or something? 'Cause that ain't happening. No. But if I wanted to tell you something, not because you were paying me, but because I wanted to tell you, that don't make me no snitch. Just two guys breaking bread, having a conversation. I don't see no bread. It's an expression. Okay, well, I heard some of the older guys talking. There's gonna be one more hit. Who? I don't know... but Xavier would... Xavier Green. He dealt for Rev. [Dialing] Where's the money? I got a call from the M.E.'s office. They're looking for this. How'd they get a hold of you? From when I signed out, apparently. You signed... you weren't supposed to sign out. Well, that's something that you neglected to tell me, Sergeant. Do not bring me into this! [Scoffs] Sergeant, why are you breaking my balls here? 'Cause you don't have any. Ruth Dwyer, M.E.'s office... she's expecting your call. The drugs got to be in your mitts before we can move in... otherwise, we got nothing. Yeah. All right? Now, if he starts accusing you of anything, you throw it right back in his face, pissed off and indignant. Pissed off and indignant. Those are your two best friends. That I can do. Now, my friend Jin here is gonna hook you up with the latest in radio transmission. Department's come a long way since taping a wire to your taint. What is that? You run out of walkmans? New guys keep breaking 'em. Here. Just take your little key, go to your little special drawer, and get me something top shelf, come on. All right. Don't get in the car, don't go in the building, don't go anywhere we don't have any eyeball on ya. You understand that? Understand that. All right, and remember... Cheeto. Cheeto. Cheeto. Cheeto. All right. I got it. It's your lifeline. I want this back. All right? Let's do it. [Indistinct chatter] [Sighs] Hey, what's up, gents? Need something? [Clears throat] How you know I'm selling? A wild guess. I used to buy from Cheeto a couple blocks up, but I guess he went on vacation. Yeah, a long one. How much you got? $300 just for now. Cool. Cool, cool. Yeah. You give me that $300 and come back in, like, 20 minutes. Oh, okay, Mr. drug dealer, I'll just give you all my money. What could possibly go wrong? Give me the cash, and then get your skinny ass off my block. Dude, I sell an ounce a week up at UIC. You want to sit here and play Barney Badass with me and break me off for 300 bucks, or would you like to make $2,000 a week? Huh? I'll give you 4 grams for $300. No, no, no, no, no. You'll give me 5. It better not be stepped on, or I'm not gonna be back. You believe this guy? Listen, bro, I need an answer, 'cause I got a sociology midterm in 34 minutes. I'm not even joking. Huh? Come on. You can't be late for class. No, sir, I cannot. [Tires screech] Police! Get your hands up! Police! Put 'em up! Police! Get 'em up! Wait, you're cops? Hands up! Get 'em up! Hands up! Hands up now! Put 'em up! I mean, this is the sweetest offer I've ever heard, right? You tell us who the Colombians are targeting next, and we won't charge you with distribution. What's the debate? Ain't no debate. I just know not to trust a word that comes out of a cop's mouth. We're trying to save someone's life. You all worried about my boy? Don't. He's ready. Them Colombians try to make a move on him, it'll be the last move they try and make. Mm-hmm. Ugh. Whoa. They were ready too. We're looking for a Shane Cameron. Xavier says he's been in hiding since yesterday. Yeah, but he has a flop house over on Addison. Might be worth checking out. All right, everybody vest up. What's up Voight's ass today? Who knows? You would. The card... How old is that thing? 13 years. Want to tell me about it? The man saved my life, and here I am. Oh, you want to know more about that? It's gonna cost you a couple of drinks. Hey, a night away from the kids and a juicy story... Happy to buy. [Chuckles] 2B? Yeah. It's okay, Lieutenant. We got it covered. I'll let you know if he's upstairs. Who? Shane Cameron. I left you a message. We're following up on the car. What car? Plate match to a black four-door seen leaving the scene of the Coop murder yesterday. Supposed to be parked around here. I never got that info. Yeah, I must have dropped the ball on that. Terminate. Pull back. Targets may be in the building. Jules. [Gasping] 10-1! Officer shot! Outside! Outside! You're gonna be all right. Jules? Hang in there. Over there. [Tires squealing] Who is that? Go! It's Pulpo! [Engines turning over] [Siren wails] [Horn honks] [Horn honks] [Horn honks] [Horn honks, siren wails] You're gonna be okay, Jules. We got to move! Get her in the ambo. She's gonna be okay, right? We got to go right now. [Tires screeching] [All grunt] Midclavicular. I'm coming with you, sister. Start an I.V. Jules, look at me. [Siren wailing] You're okay. It's gonna be okay. [Tires squealing] Go! Go! Go, stop the guy. I got it. Clear! [Grunting] Stop! [Laughing] Estas muerto, senor. Shut up! Estas muerto. Shut your mouth! Estas muerto. One offender in custody. [Cell phone rings] Yeah. [Voice breaking] Jules didn't make it. You. You played games. Back up, Voight. Yo, hey, hey... You played games, and you got her killed! Hey, come on, now! Back up! Come on! You want to play? Get off of me! Calm it down! You want to play a game? Come on, Sarge! Get off of me! Voight! Come on! Get him out of here! Get off of me! Get off of me! Antonio! How are you? It's been a while. Where are they? I want your two hit men right now. I don't know what you're talking about. You see that? That's my partner's blood. [Overlapping shouting] Antonio! Get off me! Get off! Antonio. [Groans] Sit down. Sit down! You need to take this. Yeah? [Crying] Antonio... Antonio, s... someone's taken Diego. He's gone.
