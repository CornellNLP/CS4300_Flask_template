 It's funny. They warned me about you. 
 Upstairs said, "manage him." 
 "Use him. Keep him in line. 
 And as soon as you start to lose him, take him down." 
 But they didn't do you justice, Hank. 
 They set you up to fail. 
 No, I don't think so. 
 They know this place needs a guy like you, as long as he's controlled. 
 But now you're an experiment gone wrong, Hank, and they're gonna find a way to break you. 
 You might as well know that's coming. 
 Hmm. And you'll be there to watch, huh? 
 No, probably not. 
 But I'll hear about it... and know somewhere I'll be laughing. 
 [Sighs] 
 [Soft grunt] 
 [Groans] Wake up. 
 You came. 
 What exactly do you want, Nadia? 
 If you can't say it, it's never gonna happen. 
 I called. 
 Yes, you did. 
 But then you tied a tube around your arm. 
 I want out. 
 Then you have to get clean. 
 [Sighs] 
 Yeah? 
 Yeah. 
 Yes. 
 Okay. 
 I'm gonna make some calls and get you into a facility, but it's probably gonna take me a day or two, so you're gonna stay at my place, all right? 
 Um... could you just make sure I actually walk in this time? 
 You got it. 
 Thanks. 
 Thank you. 
 [Cell phone rings] 
 What do you got, Jin? 
 That Lonnie Rodiger credit card you wanted me to track. 
 Just got a hit from a toy store downtown. 
 Text me the address. 
 [Sighs] 
 [Cell phone beeping] 
 Go for Jay. 
 Where you at? 
 On my way in. 
 Head to Chinatown. 
 Sending you the address. 
 You got it. 
 [Indistinct chatter] 
 Let's go. 
 Triad casino. 
 A lot of money rolls through here. 
 You feeling lucky? 
 Luckier than them. 
 Over here. 
 They killed the damn errand boy too. 
 [Sighs] 
 Surgical. 
 They were startled by the kid. 
 Weapons, uniforms. 
 Military, for sure. 
 These guys are pros. 
 I want a copy of this in the Intelligence office before we get back. 
 All right, this is an illegal triad gambling den. 
 It's one of two dozen that Vice thinks they operate in the area. 
 Problem is they tend to shut down and pop up somewhere else quickly. 
 Who's their competition? 
 Cermak Crew. 
 They got a lockdown on the illegal lotto in the neighborhood. 
 They take the nickels and dimes, and the triads take the bigger cash. 
 This Cermak Crew looking for a bigger piece? 
 Yeah, they could be. 
 All right, it's a start. 
 Where's Olinsky and Ruzek? 
 Coming in from the cold. 
 Well, I understand the concept of sunglasses, Ruzek, but it looks like you're trying too hard. 
 You're supposed to be from the streets. 
 Why don't you quit worrying about what I'm... 
 Olinsky, where are your non-suit reports? 
 Uh, haven't had the time. 
 I'm going up. 
 Well, make time. 
 Hey, hey, look at Ruzek. 
 [Laughs] 
 Gutierrez, you still carrying Maloney on your back? 
 Hey, I'm used to it by now. 
 Up yours. How are you, buddy? 
 Good to see you. 
 You too. 
 Those are some sweet shades, Ruzek. 
 All right, gentle, man. Easy. 
 Hey, so how is it here, man? 
 We're hoping after graduation, this is our spot. 
 Yeah, I don't know how it is for the patrolmen here. 
 I mean, I skipped that part. 
 Yeah, so we heard. 
 Yeah, put in your time, boys. That's my advice. 
 Then maybe you too can join us upstairs, right? 
 You know what? That is good advice. 
 Come here. Come here. Duty calls. 
 Let's get a drink sometime. 
 Definitely, man. 
 Say, Sergeant Platt... 
 Ruzek here needs to better appreciate the, uh... the journey that he, uh, got to bypass. 
 Oh, I've been waiting for this day. 
 I appreciate this, Detective Olinsky, sir. 
 Don't sweat it, just put your plain clothes on and just stick with me today. 
 Yes, sir. 
 Ah, there he is. 
 Look at you, all sharp. 
 Where are the shades? 
 How long? 
 We'll play it by ear. [Clicks tongue] 
 All right? 
 Well, this is awkward. 
 Oh, tell me about it. 
 Burgess, you and special sauce here will be doing foot patrol at Ron Goodwin High School. 
 Great. Thank you, Sergeant. 
 You're welcome. 
 Aka crossing-guard duty. 
 Perfect. 
 I got a contact tight inside the Cermak Crew. 
 Uh-huh. 
 He said they're making money hand over fist on the lottery and have no incentive to take on the triads. 
 We both know if someone in the Cermak Crew feels up a triad's girlfriend, economics goes out the window. 
 I'd have heard of it, Voight. Trust me. 
 Now, no one's happy about this. 
 Bad business for everyone. 
 Sells a lot of papers, though. 
 A better story will be when you find out who's doing this. 
 I want an exclusive. 
 Oh. [Chuckles] 
 Just keep my name out of it. 
 [Laughs] 
 Sergeant Voight. 
 It's a pleasure to meet you. 
 I'm Edwin Stillwell, I.A. 
 I'll be taking over your... 
 Well, I'll be working with you from now on, now that Miss Gradishar is no longer with us. 
 Look, you want to talk to me? You call me first. 
 Don't ambush me in the street. 
 See, it's words like "ambush" that get things started off on the wrong foot. 
 Now, I came here with what I hope will be a fresh approach, one that might get us better results... a partnership, if you will. 
 Uh-huh. 
 Maurice Owens. 
 Here we go. 
 My notes say that you told Gradishar that he would be arrested in a couple of weeks. 
 And now here we are on month three. 
 Yeah, well, what Gradishar didn't understand is I got to do this without him or anyone else knowing it was me. 
 That kind of work doesn't fit neatly on a calendar. 
 Okay. 
 Well, I'm gonna need more than lip service. 
 Anything else? 
 Nope. 
 Keep me in the loop. Like I said, "partnership." 
 [Whistle blows] 
 This is complete horse... 
 [Whistle blows] 
 That's 'cause you're doing it wrong. 
 Oh, yeah? 
 Yeah. 
 You got to get your hips into it, like this. 
 You're kind of full of it, you know that? 
 Am I? Or am I awesome at it? 
 This okay? 
 Yeah. 
 As long as you don't wear those cool-daddy sunglasses, you'll be fine. 
 Atwater. 
 Yeah? 
 Question for you. 
 Huh? 
 How many cards you given out over the years? 
 Nine. 
 And how many came back and asked for help? 
 Three. Why? 
 Okay. Party people, listen up. 
 I went back seven days and downloaded all in-progress and service calls in close proximity to the Chinatown quad. 
 We got three calls on suspicious vehicles. 
 I ran the plates. 
 Legit, legit, but the third came back a ghost. 
 I put that plate into our lookout database and just got a text back with its location... 
 236 West 21st... right back in Chinatown. 
 [Imitates gunshots] 
 That's another triad gambling den. 
 It looks like a karaoke bar from the outside, but they're playing pai gow once you go in. 
 All right, let's go. 
 Jin, come here. 
 Yeah. 
 Quit shaking your ass. Just give us the information. 
 Over here. 
 S.U.V.'s here, nobody inside. 
 We're in position. 
 Now we park in front of his car... so we can ram him in reverse if he takes off. 
 Always sacrifice your trunk for his engine. 
 Sit and wait, or move in? 
 Halstead... why don't you get in there and see what we're dealing with? 
 [Indistinct chatter, dance music plays] 
 ♪ ♪ 
 [Speaks under music, crowd noise] 
 ♪ ♪ 
 [Arguing in foreign language] 
 Tell me who the guy was, huh? 
 [Thud] I don't know! 
 Tell me who the guy was! 
 Please, please... 
 [Thud] Uhh! 
 You gotta have a name! 
 [Smacking sounds] 
 I said you gotta have a name for me. 
 Huh? I can't hear you! 
 [Whimpering] 
 Ohh! I need more than that. 
 [Thud] I need more than that! 
 [Gun cocks] 
 Get up! 
 What's happening, slick? 
 Now! 
 Door. 
 [Man shouting in native language] 
 Let's go. 
 Come on, move. Move. 
 I'm just trying to score some coke from my boy Peng, man. 
 Peng? Peng who? 
 Hell if I know. I just buy coke from him. 
 You're police? 
 Oh, man. Get to stepping. 
 O... okay. 
 Sorry. 
 They were cops? 
 This is the guy you saw? 
 Yeah. 
 He had his gun in the triad's mouth. 
 You know him? 
 That's Jimmy Shi. 
 We were partners when I first came up. 
 Me and Jimmy worked the gang unit together with Alvin. 
 Ivory tower recognized he'd be better served working undercover in Chinatown. 
 Yeah, perfect place for him. 
 He's got his own Vice squad now... all Chinese cops. 
 All I can tell you is he was dressed like the guys in the video, and he was looking awfully cranked. 
 So why don't we put a tail on him, see what's what? 
 'Cause it ain't him. 
 How do you know? 
 Because I do. 
 He's police. 
 You're the boss. 
 [Cell phone vibrates] 
 Excuse me. 
 This is Lindsay. 
 Hey, um, is it okay if I take a nap in your bed? 
 Take a nap, take a shower, take whatever you need. 
 Okay. 
 I spoke to a facility, and they're gonna have a room for you starting tomorrow. 
 That's great. 
 Yeah. 
 Hey, thank you again, um, for everything. 
 You got it. 
 So, partners, huh? 
 Yep. 
 Sounds like there's more to the story. 
 I'll tell you what... sometime when there's a campfire and you're no longer a cop, I might tell it. 
 What's going on with you and Halstead? 
 Not this again. 
 You want to play house more than you want to work Intelligence, just say the word. 
 Nothing is gonna happen there. 
 Good. 
 Shi. 
 Hey. 
 We're here. Let's just see where they go. 
 If it's nothing, then you talk to him. 
 Fall back. We're gonna put a tail on Jimmy. 
 Swapped with Ruzek today, huh, Atwater? 
 Yes, sir. 
 How you liking it? 
 I like it a lot, sir. 
 Call me "sir" a third time, you're gonna like it a lot less. 
 You got it, Detective Dawson. 
 Hey, O. 
 What? 
 Hypothetical... if you could start over but knowing what you know now, would your career be any different? 
 Why do you ask? 
 Just trying to help out Atwater here. 
 Well, if I could start over, I'd just end up making different mistakes than the ones I made the first time. 
 What's this? 
 Rest of the Vice team? 
 Yeah, looks like it. 
 Hey, Sarge. 
 Go for Voight. 
 It's them... they're all geared up just like in the surveillance video and moving out, headed your way. 
 We got 'em. 
 Let 'em make entry. 
 Everybody move. 
 Antonio... you, Olinsky, and Atwater take the front. 
 We'll take the back. 
 [Man shouting in foreign language] 
 [Man continues shouting in foreign language] 
 Chicago P.D.! No one move! 
 Drop your weapons! 
 Slowly! 
 Do it! 
 Get that weapon down! 
 Do it! 
 Kick it away! 
 Get down on your knees. Get down on your knees. Get down on your knees! Give me those hands. 
 What the hell are you doing here, Voight? 
 You're under arrest. 
 We got you for this robbery and three others. 
 Robbery? 
 We're here as part of a six-month operation to take down the triad leadership. 
 Yeah? Then why are you skulled up, Jimmy, huh? 
 I've been working this Chinatown detail for 11 years. 
 They know my face. 
 We were going to shake down the employees of that place to get the names on the triad. 
 Now, at least put us in the cars, would you, please? 
 What are you now, Voight... Internal Affairs? 
 We caught a robbery/homicide case, and Intelligence pursued it. 
 The gang in that video looked a hell of a lot like you. 
 I'm not dirty! 
 Jimmy. 
 We were partners... 
 Partners! 
 And did I ever look sideways at you? 
 At Alvin? 
 Not once... not when they came asking about Browning... 
 Not ever. 
 A call just went out over the radio. 
 There was another robbery. They hit the pool hall Jimmy and Rick here stopped at earlier. 
 Four masked suspects with rifles. 
 Witness says the crew came through, took the money, could've got away without any bloodshed. 
 But apparently, that's not their style. 
 We saw you and Rick come in by yourselves. 
 Yeah. We got a C.I. inside here. 
 He gave us the C.B.A. address where you arrested us. 
 He's the one with the new coin slot in his head. 
 Hmm. 
 When you came out, you radioed your crew, told them to meet up? 
 That's right. 
 They're on your radios, bro. 
 [Sighs] 
 Well, another great day at the high school, Sergeant. 
 It's just... God, it's inspiring to see young people realizing their dreams. 
 It is inspiring. 
 Perfect. 
 Now you can go pick up lunch at Manny's for everyone on desk duty. 
 Which one's yours? 
 Mine's... very good. 
 Like I'm going to tell you so you can foul it in some way. 
 We just want to make sure that we get your order perfect, Sergeant. 
 Uh-huh. Get going. My stomach's growling. 
 Get. 
 On our way. 
 Where'd you guys meet? 
 I knew a friend of her brother's. 
 We all went out one night. Wendy showed up. 
 Kind of a boring story, actually. 
 Okay, what was your first date? 
 [Chuckles] Transformers One. 
 So romantic. 
 I like that movie. 
 It's cartoon robots fighting cartoon robots. 
 Exactly. It's awesome. 
 Units in 25, we have a burglary in progress. 
 Offender is still in the house and should be considered armed and dangerous... 
 1150 South Jefferson. 
 That's just down the block. 
 2113, we're on our way. 
 Mr. Hankamer's at work. 
 I saw this crackhead moving up the side of the house with a knife. 
 He kicked in the back door. He hasn't come out. 
 All right, sir, go back inside. 
 Officers on the scene. Burglary in progress. 
 Need backup... 1150 South Jefferson. 
 2113, backup en route. 
 Kitchen. 
 [Whispering] Here, here, here. 
 You got eyes. 
 Stairs! 
 Police! 
 Stop! 
 Ah! 
 Son of a... 
 
 
 
 [Soft tapping sound] 
 [Dog barking] Oh. 
 Aah! 
 Stay down! 
 Hands behind your back. 
 Got him? 
 [Grunting] 
 You all right? 
 We already ate... from the vending machines. 
 Well, now you won't have to cook dinner. 
 You know where the 32nd district is? 
 Yeah. Yeah, I just need to... 
 I need you to pick up an envelope there. 
 Hey, nice arrest on Jefferson. 
 Hi. 
 What's up? 
 Oh, hey. 
 How's it going here, Ruzek? 
 Well, I am, uh, learning my lesson, Al. 
 That's good. 
 That's good. 
 [Indistinct chatter] 
 May I help you? 
 Sergeant Voight, hi. 
 I'm Mia Sumner. 
 Uh-huh? 
 You haven't been informed. Terrific. 
 Informed of what? 
 I'm a detective assigned to your Intelligence team. 
 Like hell you are. [Scoffs] 
 No offense... 
 Sumner. 
 Yeah, no offense, Sumner, but I choose my own team. 
 I'm sure, sir, but you should call... 
 Hang on, Jimmy. 
 [Telephone rings] 
 Voight. 
 Hank. 
 Ed Stillwell. We met earlier. 
 Yeah, I remember. 
 Look, I'm gonna have to call you back. 
 You met Detective Sumner? 
 I organized her transfer to your office. 
 She's a terrific detective, clean record. 
 What? 
 Listen, I can tell you right now that ain't happening. 
 And yet, it already has. 
 Now, if you want to talk to Deputy Chief of organized crime Billy Neff and have him storming down your office, exercise your right to fight this. 
 You and me are gonna have to have another face-to-face. 
 Oh, I look forward to it. 
 I'm in the office next to Gradishar's or, well, where she used to be, but I think mine's a little bigger, actually. 
 [Sighs] 
 Everybody, this is Detective... 
 Sumner. 
 Yeah. 
 She's gonna temporarily join Intelligence. 
 Jin. 
 Yes, Sergeant. 
 Take detective Sumner here down to your office and show her, uh... 
 I don't care what you show her. 
 Yes. Sure. 
 This way, Detective. 
 So... 
 We got a four-man robbery crew impersonating Jimmy's Vice unit, freelancers, probably ex-military, listening in on their radio calls and hitting vulnerable casinos as soon as they know Jimmy's left. 
 That's right, so we should use that against them. 
 Jimmy, why don't we have you and your team bait a fake count house with Olinsky and me acting as bankers? 
 That's it. 
 You guys radio amongst each other you got 200,000 from some new den, and they're in the process of banding it. 
 Right. Once we're inside, we put out a fraudulent 10-1, officer-needs-assistance call, and you guys radio in, aborting your surveillance to respond to the call. 
 And then we wait. 
 Yeah, with a sticky net. 
 We tie this crew to the other robberies, we put 'em away forever. 
 Hey, stay safe. 
 Hey, what happened? 
 With you and Hank and Jimmy Shi over there? 
 Ask Hank. 
 I did, and he clammed up. 
 Well, sounds like you got your answer, then. 
 Al... 
 Who's Browning? 
 [Sighs] 
 Jimmy mentioned him, and then the three of you started trading looks. 
 You know something, Erin? 
 You ever hear the expression "let sleeping dogs lie"? 
 I'm a detective. I poke the dogs. 
 Okay, well, with this one, you don't. 
 [Van door opens, closes] 
 All right, let's go. 
 Who you got? 
 I see Bao, Hai, and Ling. 
 What you thinking... new lotto house for the Cermak Crew? 
 There are at least 50 people inside playing pai gow. 
 Van's here, and I saw Bao and Ling moving in counting equipment. 
 They don't do that unless there's at least 200k. 
 What's the address? 
 50 west 23rd, across from the school. 
 We going in? 
 As soon as you get here. 
 10-4, copy that. 
 Okay, Olinsky, radio it in. 
 10-1, shots fired, 2200 South Dearborn. 
 Officer calling for help, multiple offenders on scene. 
 Break off surveillance and get to this 10-1. 
 All right. 
 All right. 
 Here they come... crown vic and a maroon S.U.V. 
 I'll take the first one through the door. 
 O, you take the second. Atwater, you clean up. 
 Yes, detective. 
 You get back. 
 Remember, we got to let 'em breach if we're gonna pin all this on 'em. 
 Let 'em breach. Roger that, Roger that. 
 Flashbang! 
 [Explosion] 
 Go, go, go! 
 Trap! 
 [Men coughing] 
 [Gunfire muffled] 
 [Tires squealing] 
 Fall back! 
 [Breathing heavily, groaning] 
 O! 
 Jay, he's going. Let's go. 
 Oh, you got him? 
 I got him. 
 [Siren blasts] 
 Clear that car! 
 Clear! 
 Clear! 
 Get your hands where we can see them now! 
 Jimmy. I got you. 
 Keep 'em where we can see 'em! 
 Come here! 
 Put 'em up! 
 Roll over. Roll over! 
 You all right? 
 Yeah. 
 We got 'em. 
 Get up. Get up! 
 God, you're like a baby. 
 You're the expert. 
 I know. 
 Come on. 
 Hey. 
 Yeah? 
 It was... 
 I'm glad we got to partner up. 
 Yeah, me too. 
 [Sighs] 
 So how was today? 
 Incredible. 
 [Chuckles] Yeah. 
 How about you? 
 Burgess treat you right? 
 Yeah, she did. 
 Ah... 
 Good. 
 [Locker door closes] 
 Well, I'll see you, man. 
 See you. 
 I'm not the bad guy here. 
 That's cool. 
 Not my department. 
 I'm good police. 
 Wow. 
 I so don't care. 
 Hey, Jin. 
 Okay. Well, good night. 
 See you guys tomorrow. 
 Oh, well, you might want to check with Sergeant Voight about that. 
 Yeah, don't think I'll need to. 
 Thanks for tracking the Rodiger credit card. 
 You know, you better be right about this, or it's my ass too. 
 Good day today. 
 Yeah. 
 What are your plans tonight? 
 Uh, I'm babysitting. 
 Ooh. 
 What about you? 
 Molly's. See you. 
 Hey, Antonio? 
 [Sighs] 
 You know anything about the name "Browning"? 
 Come on, man, Voight won't give me anything here. 
 [Sighs] 
 I got to know. 
 Well... there's rumors... there's stories... and there's what's in the record. 
 All I can tell you is this... a cop named Eddie Penland was killed on the job. 
 He was Olinsky's partner. 
 A lot of people thought a heavy named Browning was the shooter. 
 He heard the heat was on him and turned himself in. 
 Last they were seen was getting into Jimmy and Voight's squad. 
 Olinsky was with them. 
 Browning never made it to the jail. 
 That's all I know. 
 Have fun babysitting. 
 Yeah, thanks. 
 Nadia! 
 Nadia. 
 Hey. 
 Damn it. 
 Where are you? 
 I couldn't. 
 No, no, no. 
 Come on. Come on, Nadia. 
 Tomorrow you and me... we walk in there together. 
 I can't. 
 Yes, you can. 
 You are strong. I know you don't think you are. 
 But I'm telling you... 
 I gotta go. 
 Hello? 
 Nadia? 
 [Chuckling] 
 Hey. 
 Oh. 
 The magnificent mile detail is looking for patrolmen, so I recommended you to sergeant Castellaw over there. 
 All right, whatever you think is best, man. 
 I'm just messing with you, man. 
 You know? 
 This guy... 
 And I heard you did good today. 
 You did, did you? 
 So, what'd you learn? 
 I learned that things can jump off no matter what you're wearing. 
 Yeah. 
 All right, so you come ready to work tomorrow. 
 But next time I hear you big-dogging it to any of your academy mates, you're not gonna get a third chance. 
 Never again, boss. 
 All right? 
 Never again. 
 Hey. Everything okay? 
 Ask me that after I've had a drink. 
 First rule of a gunfight... bring a gun. 
 Second rule... bring friends with guns. 
 Here's to having friends in Chicago. 
 [Laughs] I like that. 
 [Laughs] 
 Mm. 
 I learned it from an old sergeant back in patrol. 
 We want another round? I need a beer. 
 Well, you're buying. 
 Pfft. 
 Hey. [Whistles] 
 We need another round and a beer. 
 [Low murmuring] 
 Hey. 
 Hey. 
 Kevin... 
 Dinner's ready. 
 What are we having? 
 Swanson's. 
 Bump that. We going to Bijan's tonight. 
 Go tell your brothers. 
 You alone? 
 This better be important to drag my ass out here. 
 It is. 
 I need you to buy me a little clearance while I have a new load brought in. 
 Fine. 
 I swear, you are gonna bleed me dry. 
 Green blood don't ever run dry, bro. 
 [Sirens whooping] 
 What the hell is this? 
 Don't say a word. 
 Let's go. 
 Hook him up. 
 [Handcuffs clicking] 
 Sergeant Voight, you are under arrest. 
 What are you doing? 
 You're finished.
