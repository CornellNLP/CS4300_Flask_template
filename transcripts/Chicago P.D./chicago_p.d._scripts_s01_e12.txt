 They're doing the race registration over in "A" wing. 
 Thank you. 
 This is my niece Zoe. 
 Do you want to go see them unload the animals for the petting zoo? 
 [Children giggle] 
 [Echoing] Hey, I like the balloons. 
 [Explosion] 
 [Overlapping screaming] 
 Girls, can you hear me? 
 Every bit of training we've had was for today, boys. 
 If there's one car bomb, there's probably a second. 
 It looks just like Oklahoma City. 
 Where's Dawson? 
 She went inside. 
 Dawson's in there? 
 [Gasps] 
 Are you okay? 
 Yeah, it's... it's just a little scratch. 
 Imogene! We need help over here! 
 Gabby! Hello? 
 She's only 9 years old! 
 You came. 
 We found our second bomb. 
 Shay, we got Dawson. 
 Shay? 
 Help! 
 We need some help over here! 
 Oh, my God. 
 Oh, she's lost a lot of blood. 
 Help me get her into one of these bays. 
 All right. 
 I'm going to need to get an I.V. started. 
 Right away. 
 [Sirens wailing] 
 First bomb detonated 8:00 A.M. on the dot. 
 Second bomb located in a rental car. 
 Car is still there. 
 Who dismantled the bomb? 
 We did. 
 Check it out. 
 If they got anything, I want to be notified first. 
 Yeah. 
 How many confirmed dead? 
 18 dead... 
 15 in critical condition, 3 employees unaccounted for. 
 The sign-ups for the charity race had just started before the bomb detonated. 
 We may have more civilians buried beneath the rubble, but there's no real way of knowing right now. 
 FBI special agent in charge wants all the bosses in the command center. 
 All right, everybody inside. 
 Voight... 
 Animals did this. 
 We'll get 'em. 
 [Indistinct shouting] 
 Hey. 
 Hey. 
 Anything? 
 Not much left to recover, but we're still digging. 
 All right. 
 You know who did it? 
 No, we're just getting started. 
 Find 'em. 
 Call out if you can hear me! 
 Who do we talk to first, Al? 
 Whoever was closest to the blast and is still alive. 
 Intelligence, C.P.D. 
 [Indistinct chatter] 
 Quiet then, okay, everybody, listen up. 
 Listen up! 
 [Chatter stops] 
 My name is William Graff. 
 I'm with the FBI. 
 I need all your help, and I know you're all eager to provide it. 
 First rule... everything goes through me. 
 Okay, I want to go over what we know right now. 
 [Heart monitor beeping] 
 Blood pressure coming up. 
 Any word on Zoe? 
 Nothing. 
 Vital signs are stable, no brain activity. 
 Keep her on life support. I need to go talk to her sister. 
 Anything on Zoe? 
 Not yet. 
 Holly... 
 [Softly] Oh, no. 
 [Crying] 
 I've made this speech. 
 [Sobs] 
 Don't say anymore. 
 Oh, God. 
 [Sniffles] Oh, God. 
 Your sister's still breathing, but there's been no brain activity for some time. 
 So she's alive. 
 I'm going to go see her. 
 Alim Al Safir, ambassador from Syria, is here for an off-the-books surgery. 
 My office and the office of Greg Simpson at CIA will be spearheading this angle, but if you encounter anything that waves near this, notify me. 
 I was going to do the transplant... 
 On the Syrian ambassador? 
 All right. 
 Did you see anything that looked out of place? 
 Do you remember? 
 Oh, he had his guys. 
 Guys? 
 He's an ambassador. He has guys. 
 And the next thing I knew, the ground shook like it was an earthquake. 
 I thought for a second I was back in San Francisco. 
 Dr. Willhite, 7632. 
 Dr. Willhite, 7632. 
 All right. 
 We also have an orderly who works here with distant ties to a radical Muslim group. 
 I can't help you. I didn't do it. 
 I didn't see who did it, and I've got to focus on what I can do, which is save as many lives and limbs as I possibly can. 
 I got it. Thank you. 
 All right. 
 There were two guys... baseball caps on, sunglasses. 
 I noticed because everyone else was walking toward the tent to sign up for the race. 
 They were walking away from it. 
 And what else did you notice about them? 
 Tan skin... olive, dark hair for sure. 
 But could have been Hispanic or Arab or Italian. 
 I don't know. 
 Excuse me. Agent Graff? 
 Sergeant Hank Voight, Intelligence, C.P.D. 
 How you doing? 
 Listen, I'm really going to need your help... securing the perimeter, conducting interviews. Thanks. 
 My unit is gonna be doing a hell of a lot more than interviewing hospital staff and setting out pylons. 
 This happened in my city, on my soil. 
 Don't get in my way. 
 Okay, I'll get somebody on it right away. 
 [Indistinct radio chatter] 
 Here you go. 
 Yeah, thanks. 
 [Sighs] 
 Sweeping the whole area. 
 I'm gonna need a few minutes, Billy. 
 Catch these guys. 
 Yeah. 
 Both males enter a white four-door Sedan and head out the southeast exit of the lot. 
 And we have security video? 
 The security office was in the impact zone. 
 Database is gone, as in gone gone. 
 Second car with a bomb was rented out of some dirt-lot company in Milwaukee. 
 The name and the credit card on the rental agreement came back bogus. 
 And there's no security video at the company, or so they're saying. 
 So Milwaukee P.D.'s heading there to investigate. 
 Sumner, you dealt with all those antigovernment nutcases when you were working undercover at the NATO protests, am I right? 
 That's right. 
 All right, beat the bushes. 
 Hey, guys, I just heard. 
 Burgess was here when it happened, and her niece is in the I.C.U. 
 How bad? 
 Not good. 
 Hey. 
 It's Zoe... 
 She's, um... she's an only child. 
 Her... my sister and her husband are out of town. 
 That's why she's staying with me. 
 And now Imogene... 
 Hey. 
 Hi. 
 Hey. 
 We just heard. What did they say? 
 A ruptured liver. 
 She's... there's a list or something, a donor list. 
 They're trying to match. 
 Do we know who did it? 
 Anybody taking credit? 
 Okay... 
 The lab got a print off the duct tape of bomb number two. 
 Came back to a Paul Watts. 
 V.L.D. has him registered at 5225 South Laramie. 
 I secured a no-knock search warrant. 
 Give us five minutes before you notify the feds about that print. 
 Yeah. 
 They need you out on the perimeter. 
 I'm okay. 
 One more thing... the second bomb was set to go off at 8:30 P.M. 
 The bomber screwed up somewhere. 
 We're gonna ask for forgiveness instead of permission today, you understand? 
 We're not slowing down for anything. 
 I mean anything. 
 No one's gonna give a damn once these bastards are caught. 
 All right, let's go. 
 You let us know if anything changes, okay? 
 Okay. 
 Thank you. 
 Paul Watts... most recently a dishwasher at a Red Lobster in Tallahassee. 
 Minor sheet... a couple possession charges, D&D... 
 What? 
 Nothing. 
 [Heart monitor beeping, respirator hissing] 
 [Sniffles] 
 I'm, uh... [sighs] 
 I'm trying to get a hold of my father to notify him. 
 My, um... 
 I understand. 
 [Sighs] 
 I'll recommend we take her off life support. 
 I'll explain it to him medically. 
 Okay. 
 All right, that's who we're looking for. 
 Apartment 1-A. 
 Okay, careful of wires or traps. 
 Anything's possible. 
 Hey, what's this? 
 Hey! Hey! 
 Hands on the wheel! Hands on the wheel! 
 Turn your head and look at me! Don't move! 
 Keep your eyes on me. 
 It's not him. 
 Clear. 
 What the hell is going on? 
 It's our bad. Have a nice day. 
 Well, it's clean. 
 I can't make any guarantees, though. 
 Paul Watts! C.P.D.! 
 Clear! 
 Body! 
 Clear! 
 Clear. 
 Call it in. 
 All right. 
 This wasn't a suicide. Gun's on the right. 
 Cell phone clip and wallet are on the left side of the belt. 
 He has no burn from muzzle flash, no gunshot residue on his face. 
 Somebody had to shoot him from five feet away. 
 They set this up. 
 All right, call Jin and Sumner. 
 I want to know everything about this guy... the first movie he rented right down to the last breath mint he bought... everything. 
 [Woman speaking indistinctly over P.A.] 
 [No audio] 
 [Crying] 
 [Breathes deeply] 
 [Heart monitor beeping] 
 Hey. 
 Hey. 
 [Sighs] There was an explosion. 
 You weren't gonna tell anyone about that enormous gash in your side? 
 [Chuckles] I... 
 I kept meaning to. I just... 
 I had to keep going. 
 I know. I know. But not anymore. 
 Always looking out for me. 
 [Indistinct chatter on radio] 
 Rest up, okay? 
 Okay. 
 Severide. 
 Um... 
 There were two little girls about the same age... I think eight. 
 Do you know if they made it? 
 I don't know. Um, it's... 
 It's bad out there. 
 Just get some rest, okay? 
 His prints were on the tape. 
 Whoever he was working with took him out. 
 Crime scene is at his place doing a full workup. 
 The Muslim orderly we've been looking into... we just found traces of fertilizer in the bed of his truck. 
 How's he connected? 
 We haven't put the dots together yet, but he's our focus. 
 Just keep interviewing staff. 
 What do you got? 
 Jin did a cross-match on Watts for known associates. 
 All right. 
 It turns out Watts was trolling the websites of some pretty heavy-duty anti-government groups. 
 We pulled the names of some people that he had repeated contact with. 
 Haven't been able to actually access the contents of the emails. 
 I was just able to get addresses. 
 Whoa. Wait a second. Wait a second. Go back. 
 Go back. Wait, hold on, wait a sec. 
 Yeah, that's him. That's the guy. 
 What guy? 
 The guy who told me two dark-skinned guys in sunglasses were leaving the scene. 
 That's the guy. 
 He's here. 
 Thank you for everything, and I am so sorry for what you guys have been through. 
 You're all heroes. 
 Pat Vaughn? 
 Yeah? 
 Would you mind coming with us for a minute? 
 I just checked out. 
 We just have a few follow-up questions. 
 Of course. 
 Sure. 
 Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! 
 Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! 
 [Screaming] 
 Take it easy! 
 I am walking out of here. 
 Back up! 
 Don't go any further, Vaughn. 
 I got nothing to lose. 
 Okay. What are you hoping to gain? Do you think we're gonna let you drive out of here? I got no problem slitting a throat, especially a cop's. Easy. Back up! Okay, man. What's going on here? We're just trying to save some people... Shut up! Listen... Let's just talk this out, all right? You want to walk out of here, you can walk out of here. Don't say another word! Hey! You all right? Stay down. You okay? Yeah. Thank you. Thank you. I need a room. Don't move. This guy involved? Looks like it. On your feet. You can bring him in to any firehouse in the city. We'll take five minutes, all right? We'll get some answers from him, I promise. Thank you. Thank you. [Grunts] Voight. I got him. Sir? The Muslim orderly checks out. The fertilizer residue found in his truck traces to a community garden in his neighborhood. Well, we're onto something here. Yeah, I can't let you traipse off with our only lead, doing God knows what at all hours. All I need is 30 minutes. You got 20. [Yells] My shoulder is broken. I demand medical treatment. 18 people died in that bomb blast... A dozen more clinging to their life upstairs... 9-year-old girl who's a niece of a cop in my district. You tell me everything you know, every participant... because as a coward, Vaughn... and I know you're a coward, 'cause that's who lays bombs at cancer fund-raisers... you will not endure the pain that I'm going to put you through. I need to see a... aah! Now, let me tell you what I need. I need to know about 8:30 P.M. Once I get medical treatment. [Screaming] Vaughn said him and Watts were both hooked up with a guy named Ted Powell. Ted Powell... I know that name. He was big in the anti-government fringe. So was his dad. Why did Watts get killed? Vaughn and Watts were both in charge of setting off two separate car bombs. Both bombs were supposed to go off tonight... Watts at 8:00, Vaughn at 8:30. Watts must've rigged his wrong, 'cause it went off this morning. 8:00 P.M. was gonna be the gala for the C.P.D. and the C.F.D. Brass, right? Right. First bomb was set to get them. Second bomb was set to get the first responders. What else you get out of him? Vaughn said that Powell had some master plan that he didn't share with him. So this wasn't the end of it. Here's Powell. I saw him outside the hospital with the crowd. He was here too. All right, let's check out his dad. 
 
 Casey! Hey. How's Gabby? She's fine. She's home... a little rattled still, but who can blame her? Here. Oh, thanks, man. Thanks for getting her out. Mm. I told her she owes me a 12-pack. Any more survivors pulled out from the rubble? Doesn't look good. We saw a woman's hand, spent the last hour digging her out. It was a single mom from accounting... two kids at home. Who would do something like this? I've got a pretty good idea. Ten years ago, Frank Powell, many of you will remember, was arrested after a two-day standoff at his ranch outside of Kankakee. His wife died in the gun battle. The old man is doing life at Stateville. Two of my detectives are en route to interview him. Ted Powell was there when the ranch was raided. He lost his mother and his father that day. He has been a fixture on radical anti-government websites ever since. Powell... correct. Okay. How far back? Far back as they go. Five years? Okay. I'm gonna just need my supervisor to approve. He should be back in... Have you been watching the news today, man? Do I need to run down a list of the dead? [Mouse clicking] Thank you. You're aware of what happened at Chicago Med today? I am. Your son Ted was involved, possibly the mastermind, but you probably knew that. So you allege. Look, whatever problems you've had with the government, whatever losses you've suffered, there's no way to excuse what your son did today. Now, we have reason to believe that there might be more to his plan, another step. So we can work out a deal, okay? It's a buyer's market right now. You help us, and we'll help you. I couldn't be more proud of him. You know, children were killed. I got to explain collateral damage to you? We're in a war. And in a war, there are gonna be noncombatant casualties. Okay. What do you want? There's got to be something you want. You know when the police department started to go south? When they started letting minorities in. Yes or no? You want to make a deal? 'Cause before, see, when all the cops were white, you could talk to them like a normal person. But you get a minority in there, and there's all this resentment from historical and personal shortcomings that comes to the fore. Now's their big chance to get back at their oppressors. You mean like this? I don't care what you have to do. No, you give me an exact time. I need it now. Halstead. Yeah. Hold on. I think everyone's gonna want to see this. Okay, okay, settle down. Settle down. Hit it. Ted Powell just posted this on a fringe anti-government website. In 2004, my family's home in Kankakee, Illinois... we came under attack, without justification, by the Chicago police department. We were fired upon, and our home was engulfed in flames. The Chicago Fire department stood by and did nothing. My mother died that day, and my father sits in prison. I have waited ten years for the C.P.D. and C.F.D. to admit wrongdoing and to drop all charges against my father. I will wait no longer. I'm declaring war on the Chicago Police Department and Chicago Fire Department. If you are a member of either department, you are not safe. If you are a family member of someone in either department, you are not safe. This is just the beginning. You've been warned. Yep, I got it. I'll call you back. A Ryan Wilcox visited Powell's dad in prison three times in the last six months. Lindsay did a workup on him. He's loosely affiliated with various anti-government groups... explosives background from a stint in the army. Jin, she was gonna to send you something. Yeah, I got it. Wilcox owns a garage in an industrial area where 96th meets the Calumet River. All right, have Antonio and Lindsay meet us at the garage. You stay here. Feed us what we need. And keep Graff in the loop. So you're saying zero chance? Yes. Yes, Mr. Thelan, that's what we're saying... Zero. [Sighs] But there's something you can do that couldn't have been done even 30 years ago. Your daughter's blood type is "O" negative. That's a match for another girl that got hit by the same blast with a ruptured liver, right down the hall. She's going to die if she doesn't get a new one. That'll be two 9-year-olds killed by... something like this. Under normal circumstances, you'd have time to work with the state to donate your daughter's organs. Today... I'm asking you to make a targeted donation. If you agree... your daughter's death won't be meaningless. That... that I know to be true. It's your decision, dad. But if it were me... let's let her go. [Both crying] We need to know in minutes, not hours. Doctor... Imogene would want this. [Indistinct chatter] Is that people talking in there? A radio's on. It's positive for barium nitrate. Let's try the roof. All right, grab the fiber-optic. [Drill whirring] Now, what happens if the plaster falls and sets off the bomb? You'll be the first to know. All right. Do your thing. [Device beeps] Front, side, rear door are all rigged. So is the roll-up. Wires and 50-gallon drums attached to each. Short version... do not breach. We could rappel down. All right, we don't need the whole team going in. I'll do it. I just took the class in the academy. Aced it. Okay. All right, well, I need two. Any volunteers? You. Don't turn on any lights. Yeah. Yeah. Come on. Let's do this. [Indistinct chatter on radio] Clear. [Chatter continues] Ryan Wilcox is here... multiple gunshot wounds. How long's he been dead? I'd say a day? Max. It's Powell tying up more loose ends. They left a lot of stuff behind. They never thought it'd be found. They figured this whole block would be a crater. Wilcox purchased a white cargo van about two months ago. There were three timing devices purchased. I'm not a pessimist, but... There's a damn good shot that there's a third car bomb out there in a white cargo van. If the second bomb was supposed to go off at 8:30 P.M., maybe the third bomb was set to go off at that time as well. What time is it now? 7:55. 29 minutes and counting. I'm listening, but I don't hear dick. Hospital parking lot? Fully vetted. Blowing up a district would be too risky. A bomb would be sniffed out in seconds. A firehouse? Not enough victims. Powell wanted high-ranking police and firefighters dead. Most of them planned on attending the 10k gala. Yeah, and where would the rest be tonight? Headquarters. Bull's-eye. [Respirator whirring] You ready, Greta? Ready, doctor. [Sighs] Let's have one good thing come out of this day. Thank you. [Both crying] Be on the lookout for a van near the front door. Jin, text everyone the photo and plate number of the van purchased. You're looking for a white econoline. Bomb squad en route. We should have made that left. Halstead, Lindsay, those back roads pay off? Yeah, but traffic patterns are all screwed up because of the bombing. 15 minutes out. Alvin, please, give me some good news. Alvin? Pulling up now. Any eyes on the vehicle? Not yet. We're sure this van is white? Vehicle located, south side entrance. It's blue, not white... no tags. 12 minutes. Jin, bomb squad update. Three blocks away. Hey, if Powell was at the hospital because he likes to watch his handiwork... What's that? Right there. Up top? Yeah, right there. See? Hey, on the roof. What do we got? On the roof! [Tires screech] Freeze! Drop it! Get out! Get out of the building! Now! Go! Go! Go! Stairs. He's going up. There's Voight. Come on. Nine minutes! We think Powell is on the apartment building! In pursuit! There's the bomb squad! You stay with the bomb! Hey! Officer Sumner, District 21. Explosive is inside the van, set to go off in 8 1/2 minutes. All right, clear the area, please. Get back! Back! Move! Suspect's entered roof! Drop your weapon! Cover me.  You can't win! Drop your weapon! Put it down! I want him alive! Aah! Get up. How many of your boys did I put in the dirt today? Any of 'em good friends? You wanna watch? [Screaming] Watch it. No! No, no! Time check! 60 seconds! [Radio beeping] Bomb dismantled. Repeat... bomb dismantled. Aah! Plan failed. Actually, I think it was a pretty good day. [Coughs] [Grunts] Aah! [Handcuffs clicking] That's good work tonight. [Indistinct chatter over police radio] Voight. Good working with you... Or, uh, watching you work, I should say. You too, sir. Hey. You all right? Solid. Tough guy. Suction. [Heart monitor beeping] As a senior resident, I was on call. I was working with the chief trauma surgeon. I knew he'd be the one deciding if I got the coveted trauma fellowship position. About 9:00 P.M., we were up to our eyeballs in trauma cases, and I got a call that my dad suffered a heart attack. Was rushed to another hospital. Clamp. I asked if I could leave to be with my father. He looked me in the eye and said, "yeah, you can go, but you'll never get the trauma fellowship." I couldn't believe how insensitive this guy was. Heart rate 150. Pressure is dropping. We saved 16 people that night, but my dad passed away. Heparinized saline. Removing proximal clamp. 80 systolic. 76, 70. [Heart monitor beeping rapidly] It's a day like today when I understand why that surgeon did that. This is the life we've chosen. And what we can do is right here and now. It's the most important thing. [Heart monitor beeping steadily] And that is to try and save this little girl. [Door opens] The operation went as well as could be expected. There's, uh, good blood flow to the liver, and the other bleeding has stopped. She's got a long road ahead of her, but, uh, it's looking good. [Sobbing] [Sighs] Where the fire department is still working hard to clean up the mess left by a bomb that went off at 8 o'clock this morning, leaving 18 dead... How many survivors they pull out? I just heard over two dozen. Thanks. Chicago will bounce back. Yeah. She always does. We'll give you more information as we get it. We're here... we're gonna be here all night... [Sighs] [Knock at door] Hey. Hey. I should have called. I know. You don't ever have to call. I just have one request. Yeah? Name it. Stay the night. After today, I... I'm not going anywhere.
