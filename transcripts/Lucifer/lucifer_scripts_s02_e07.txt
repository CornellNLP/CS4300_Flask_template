 Previously on Lucifer... 
 Seriously. Tell me, what do you actually want? 
 My father was a cop. He was a great cop. 
 I really do want to help people. 
 She starred in  Hot Tub High School. 
 And two weeks later, her father died. 
 Dan :  You were right before. 
 We've been living in the past for too long. 
 It's time we get a divorce. 
 Maze :  I need to figure out  where I fit in in this world. 
 So, we're still good to be roomies, right? 
 Linda :  I need you  to be honest with me about who you are. 
 No more lies. 
 Lucifer : Very well.

 Before I forget... for you and Grace. 
 Hot Tub High School? 
 Opens Friday. 
 My little monkey's gonna be a star. 
 We wouldn't miss it. 
 Do me a favor. 
 I hear there's some funny business about 15 minutes in... 
 Oh, you mean that scene where... 
 Yeah, yeah, yeah. 
 Let's not finish that thought. 
 Just tell her it was a good movie. 
 Kids these days. 
 Yeah, I know. 
 But, hey... I'm proud of her.

 Lucifer : Detective! 
 I have a bone to pick with you. 
 Not a good time, Lucifer. 
 Agreed. It's a horrible time. 
 Dr. Linda just canceled my session. 
 She won't take my calls. I think I... truly scared her off. 
 Something happened with your shrink? 
 Yes... and it's all your fault. 
 I mean, you're the one who suggested I open up to her. 
 Well, smashing advice, Detective. 
 I don't have time for this right now. 
 What, do we have a case? 
 I'm dealing with my own issues. 
 Oh! Even better. 
 Let's solve those, shall we? 
 Lucifer, stop! 
 I'm sorry, but there is no way that you can help me right now. 
 You're just... you're too you. 
 Oh. 
 Yes, you're right, Detective. 
 Being me seems to be a problem, doesn't it? 
 Everywhere I go, someone gets hurt. 
 Well, clearly, I need to be Not-Me instead. 
 Someone... better, more helpful. 
 More boring. 
 Dan : Okay... got you a hot, soy latte, extra foam. 
 Thank you. 
 You okay, Chloe? 
 Mm-hmm. All good. 
 Just on my way out. 
 Something's seriously bothering her. 
 Hmm? 
 Oh, I hadn't noticed. 
 But you did. 
 [lock buzzes, latch clicks] 
 Chloe :  This isn't right, Warden. 
 Joe Fields is a convicted murderer, a cop killer. 
 You're letting him off on family leave? 
 Detective, I understand how you feel. 
 Oh, respectfully, there is no way you understand how I feel. 
 I'm sorry. 
 I know it's your father we're talking about, but... this wasn't my call. 
 Fields has been a model prisoner for over a decade. 
 He lobbied the Prisoner's Rights Board and they said yes. 
 What's he gonna do with his leave? 
 Go destroy another family? 
 It's for his granddaughter's christening. 
 My dad never got to go to his granddaughter's christening. 
 Where is the justice in that? 
 I'm sorry, Detective. 
 I wish there was something we could do. 
 [sighs] 
 [lock buzzes, latch clicks] 
 [phone rings] 
 Uh... Decker. 
 Lucifer : Ah, Detective! 
 I think I may have found a way to make myself useful. 
 What? It's not a good time, Lucifer. 
 What if I told you I wasn't Lucifer anymore? 
 What? 
 I've decided to try and walk a mile in another man's shoes. 
 See the world from a different perspective. 
 I'm going to learn how to Douche. 
 I... may have to rephrase that one. 
 But do I have your permission to follow Daniel and... 
 Yeah, do whatever. I got to go. 
 Hello? 
 I'll take that as a yes. 
 Dan : Yeah, I'm just following up on... 
 Uh, yeah. 
 ♪ ♪ 
 Joe Fields. 
 Come out. 
 You're not gonna get away with this. 
 Joe Fields... 
 ♪ ♪ 
 I still don't get it, man. 
 Why the hell are you following me around all of a sudden? 
 Because I want to learn what it's like to be you, Daniel. 
 Your approach to life intrigues me. 
 [laughs dryly] This from the guy who punched me in the face? 
 That was last week. 
 Anyway, the detective already agreed to it. 
 You're the department bottom, so you have to do as she says. 
 What's this really about? 
 [sighs] 
 Look, people like you. 
 They find you helpful, like duct tape or a trusty socket wrench. 
 I want you to teach me your secret. 
 I want you to show me how to be a tool. 
 You should stay out of the way. 
 Follow my lead. I call all the shots, you understand? 
 This feels like something that you would agree to, so yes. 
 What do we got? 
 Three gunshot victims, shot execution style. 
 The van driver got a single bullet to the neck, guard got one to the head. 
 The prisoner got a double tap to the chest. 
 Prisoner's name is Joe Fields. 
 Wait a minute, the Joe Fields? As in... 
 Chloe : Yeah. 
 The guy that killed my father. 
 They targeted him while he was vulnerable. This was a hit, Dan. 
 Ella : W-Wait a second. 
 The guy who killed your dad was just murdered and you caught the case? 
 Yeah. 
 That is totally messed up. 
 Mm-hmm. 
 Are you okay? 
 Yeah, I'm fine. 
 Lucifer : Fine? 
 You should be ecstatic. 
 [laughs]: Your father's killer just got the ultimate punishment. 
 Who was first on the scene? 
 It was me. 
 I made the call. 
 Dan :  You followed him? 
 Yeah. I know this looks bad. 
 You stalked your father's murderer right before he was killed. 
 That was a terrible move, Detective. 
 It was, right? 
 What were you planning to do, Chloe? 
 Crash the christening? 
 I don't know, Dan! I was angry. 
 The guy killed my father. 
 He had the nerve to smile at me. 
 Do you have any idea what that feels like? 
 No. 
 No, I don't. 
 But you still shouldn't have followed him. 
 No one actually thinks that you did this, but you know what it looks like, right? 
 Yes, I do. 
 That's why I'm gonna step away from the case. 
 It's a massive conflict of interest. 
 Don't worry, Chloe. I'm gonna stay on this. 
 Yes, Detective Dan and I won't rest until we catch the killer. 
 I don't think that it's a good idea for Lucifer to be part of this case. 
 I agree. 
 I mean, the last thing this case needs is a loose canon. 
 She needs someone like you. A reliable, helpful, boring detective. 
 Now, the good news is that's me as well now. So, the Dans are on the case. 
 Can't you take anything seriously, man? 
 I assure you I'm taking this very seriously. 
 Oh, really? You're doing a great job of showing that. 
 Guys. 
 It would mean a lot to me if you worked together on this. 
 Hmm. 
 Of course, Chloe. 
 Okay, so... whoa, this looks heavy. 
 Like waiting-for-STD-results heavy. 
 [whispering]: I can come back later. 
 Oh, no, it's fine. What is it? 
 Okay, so, I went through all the prints from the van. 
 Okay? And all of them cleared as prison personnel except for an ex-con named Rodney Lam. 
 And get this... he served time with Joe Fields. 
 We're on it. 
 We're on it. 
 Nice. 
 You working on a new role? 
 Hmm? 
 [scoffs] 
 You're wearing that to an interview? 
 What's the job? 
 Preschool aide. 
 Do you like little kids? 
 [chuckles] 
 I've dealt with filthy, screaming humans before. 
 At least these are smaller. 
 I'm not sure this is you. 
 Beatrice : Ms. Perez says we should choose jobs we love doing. 
 So, what about you, Maze? 
 What do you love to do? 
 I don't know. 
 Well... just be yourself. 
 Thanks, little human. 
 So good. 
 Well, the secret ingredient is the Hawaiian bread. 
 And then you just cut a hole in the middle for the egg. 
 Can we have this for every meal? 
 You know, this one used to be my favorite, too. 
 Grandpa used to bring me this sandwich every Thursday after acting class. 
 Why don't you ever talk about Grandpa? 
 Mm... 
 I guess 'cause I miss him. 
 Do you think he would've brought me sandwiches? 
 Mm-hmm. 
 I think he would've loved that, monkey. 
 [knocking at door] 
 Come on. It's time for your homework. 
 Can I help you? 
 Chloe Decker? 
 You're gonna pay for what you've done. 
 Okay, take it easy. 
 My father was a good man. 
 He didn't deserve to get gunned down like an animal. 
 All he wanted was to meet my daughter. 
 You're Tina Fields. 
 You killed my father. 
 I didn't... 
 Thought you were getting revenge, but you murdered an innocent man. 
 Tina, think about your baby. 
 If you pull that trigger, you'll never hold her again. 
 Beatrice : Mommy? Who's here? 
 It's nothing, honey. Stay in your room! 
 I didn't kill your father. 
 You have to believe me. 
 Mommy, is everything okay? 
 Yeah, honey. Everything's fine, monkey. 
 Go back in your room. 
 Mommy just needs to help another mommy. 
 Okay? 
 Oh, God, I'm sorry. 
 I was just so angry. 
 I never wanted to believe my dad killed a cop. 
 And then today, when I got the video... 
 What video? 
 His lawyers sent this to me. 
 Said I was to receive it upon the event of his death. 
 ♪ ♪ 
 LUCIFER:  Ah. Sorry, not sorry. I had to stop for a costume change. 
 Nice jacket. 
 Thank you. Oh, man, what the hell? 
 Are you here to work, or are you here to play games? 
 LUCIFER:  I'll have you know I take the School of Dan quite seriously, even if it does involve skinny-fit jeans. Any news on our suspect? 
 His name is Rodney Lam. 
 A CI told me that he's obsessed with this place. He eats here all the time. 
 So if he shows up, let's try to see him before he sees us. 
 LUCIFER:  Oh, I get it now. So your boring attire is like camo for the average Joe. Blend in, catch the baddie off guard. Afterwards they'll forget you're even there. That is very clever, Daniel. 
 This guy has a serious history of violence. 
 All right? He might have a gun. 
 He might take a hostage. Who knows what he could do? 
 LUCIFER:  So he wouldn't, say, be openly eating a nacho burrito dog, sitting on that car? 
 DAN:  You watch my six. 
 LUCIFER:  Absolutely. 
 DAN:  Rodney Lam. LAPD. No sudden moves. You're under arrest. Rodney? 
 LUCIFER:   Maybe we blend in so well he doesn't even see us. 
 DAN:  Rodney Lam! 
 Good call, Rodney. 
 Nice and easy. 
 Oh. 
 I just wanted one last meal. 
 You want a bite? Aah! 
 LUCIFER:  No, thank you, we're not doing carbs, are we? 
 [clears throat] 
 Baby... it's Daddy. 
 If, uh, you're watching this, that means I'm dead. 
 Now, I know it sucks. 
 I don't know if you'll get this tomorrow or, uh, 30 years from now, but I want you to know the truth. 
 I didn't kill that cop. 
 I'm sorry for... missing all your birthdays and graduation... your life. 
 But Daddy wants you to know, baby... 
 I love you. 
 See? He's innocent. 
 Tina, I can tell your dad loves you very much, but... this video doesn't prove anything. 
 His lawyers had this tape for 16 years. 
 He made them promise to give it to me when he died. 
 That has to mean something. 
 16 years. 
 He recorded this the day my father was killed. 
 [camera beeps] 
 CHLOE:   Three minutes before he died. What part of town is this? 
 It's our old apartment in Venice. 
 My father was killed across the city in Korea town. 
 Chloe : There's no way your father could have recorded this and gotten to the crime scene in time. 
 So it's true. He didn't do it. 
 Which means whoever did kill my father got away with this and is still out there. 
 [breathes deeply, exhales] 
 Rodney :  I did it. 
 I killed Joe Fields. 
 He disrespected me in the yard. 
 So when I heard that he was getting some sort of temporary leave, I knew that it was my chance to make things right. 
 Well, there you have it. 
 Looks like our douching paid off. The detective will be pleased. 
 And, you know, you make it look so easy. 
 Where did you say you stopped that van again? 
 Spring and College. 
 We found it at Hill. 
 That's what I meant. 
 Then you went and you emptied the clip into the driver, right? 
 Hell yeah. 
 The driver died from a single shot to the neck. 
 Dan One, why are you spoiling a perfectly good confession? 
 You're lying, Rodney. 
 You don't know the facts because you didn't do it. 
 Oh, I see what you did there. 
 Gosh, that's why you're Dan One. 
 Why are you confessing to a crime you didn't commit? 
 Where are you going? 
 Well, just slow your roll for a second. 
 I think, for the sake of the detective, I'm gonna take a time-out from my Dansformation. 
 [inhales, exhales dramatically] 
 [chuckling]: Oh, God. 
 Rodney, what do you want out of life, hmm? 
 To be a good provider and take care of my family. 
 So you confess to a crime you didn't commit. 
 That's quite counter-intuitive. 
 Unless you got paid to do it. 
 You've been locked up for most of your life. 
 That's all you know. 
 Now you're free, you've got mouths to feed, No way to earn. 
 Out here I'm no one, guys. 
 And if we don't arrest you, you don't get any money. 
 But if he really wants back in the slammer, then false confession's a criminal offense, correct? 
 Definitely an obstruction of justice. 
 Mm. 
 Could get you a few years. 
 Lucifer : We could get you a narcoleptic lawyer and a merciless judge. 
 Who knows? With your prior history, they might throw the book at you. 
 Hmm? 
 All right. 
 Here's how it went down. 
 I put word out that I needed money, I was desperate. 
 And some people came to me with an offer. 
 [banging on door] 
 Linda, you there? 
 I need a character reference. 
 Linda? 
 [doorknob rattles] 
 [footfalls departing] 
 [gasps] 
 Wha...? 
 Can you teleport? 
 [laughs] What? No. 
 You left your window open. 
 Hey, are you okay? 
 Wait. 
 You know, don't you? 
 He showed you. 
 I saw his face. 
 Well, you're taking it really well, actually. 
 Linda, you're not afraid of  me,  are you? 
 Of course I am. 
 You're a demon. 
 He told me. 
 I thought it was a sexual metaphor. 
 Well, you're not wrong there. 
 But you really are one. 
 Aren't you? 
 Yeah... I am. 
 Is that really so bad? 
 Please go. 
 [door creaks] 
 Lucifer : Ah, Detective... 
 Chloe : Joe Fields didn't kill my father. 
 Dan : Wait, what? 
 He's a fall guy. 
 He made a false confession in exchange for regular payments to his daughter. 
 All these years she didn't touch the money. 
 She probably thought it was stolen. 
 I have the account number that made the transfers. 
 Well, we just met a chap who did the same thing. 
 What? 
 Rodney got paid to make a false confession. 
 Money was transferred into his wife's account right after we arrested him. 
 This is the same account that paid Rodney Lam's wife. 
 Chloe : That's no coincidence. 
 So whoever killed Joe Fields killed my father... and is still out there. 
 Hey, don't blame yourself. 
 You were just a kid back then. 
 Yeah, well, I'm not anymore. 
 [indistinct police radio chatter] 
 Cop : Hey, rookie! 
 You're late! 
 I thought I was early. 
 Your FTO's been looking all over for you. 
 What, you want to get written up your first day? 
 No, I-I honestly thought... 
 Knock it off, McMillan. 
 Get back to work. 
 You gotta watch out for this guy. He gave me hell on my first day, too. 
 
 
 
 Hi. 
 Hi. 
 I'm Dan Espinoza. 
 Chloe Decker. 
 Nice to meet you. 
 Can I help you with those? 
 Sure. 
 Come on, I'll show you around. 
 The most important place, first, is the kitchen. 
 We got bagels over here if you want them. 
 Interrogation's that way... and the lab is that way. 
 Are you John Decker's daughter? 
 I-I'm so sorry. 
 He's kind of a legend around here. 
 It was a little before my time, but he sounded like a great guy. 
 The best. 
 Um... bagel? 
 [blowing faux fanfare] 
 Never fear, Luci-Dan is here. 
 Or is it Douche-ifer? Actually, it's got more of a ring to it, hasn't it? 
 Why are you two dressed the same? 
 Don't ask. 
 The bank account traces back to a bathhouse on Pico. 
 It's a dummy front for a Russian syndicate in L.A. 
 So the real killer is somehow connected to the Russian mob? 
 We have a suspect. His name is Boris Sokolov. Owns the bathhouse. 
 Connects criminals but keeps his own hands clean. 
 No one has ever been able to get to him. 
 Yet. 
 Detective Dan and I won't rest until we get to the bottom of this, I promise you. 
 [sighs] 
 [American accent]: Wow. Look who bought a ticket to the gun show! 
 Divorce becomes you, Detective. 
 I do not sound like that. 
 Of course we do. 
 We sound like two totally normal dudes. 
 Will you cut it with the "we" stuff? 
 I need you to stop playing around and take this seriously. 
 You got it, partner. This is gonna be epic. 
 Lucifer, I'm not kidding. 
 [sighs] 
 [regular accent]: Very well. 
 So, what's the plan? 
 Well, you are exactly the kind of person that Boris would deal with, so I need you to approach him, and try make a deal with him. 
 All right. Tell him I need a fall guy for a murder I'm gonna commit? 
 Exactly. 
 Hmm. 
 But like I said before, he spooks really easily. So, don't go... 
 Boris! 
 Like that. 
 Hello there. 
 Uh, I'd like to talk with you, if I may. 
 I don't know you. 
 You don't. 
 So, let's fix that, shall we? 
 The name's Dan. 
 ♪ ♪ 
 Deputy Warden's here for you. 
 Oh. 
 Joe Fields' personal effects. 
 We usually turn those over to the next of kin within 72 hours, but, uh... 
 I thought it might help you, Detective. 
 Thank you. 
 This is great. Thank you. 
 Well, if there's anything else I can do to help, please, let me know. 
 [quietly]: Thanks. 
 I know. 
 Joe Fields isn't my case. 
 I'll just... I'll leave it for Dan. 
 Well, I mean, nothing is stopping  me  from helping out with the Joe Fields case, while you tackle your dad's, right? 
 I mean, if it's the same killer... divide and conquer. 
 You don't have to do that. 
 I kind of already started. 
 Uh, right over here. Thanks. 
 Last six months of your dad's paperwork. 
 You know, incident reports, booking slips, arrest records. 
 I mean, half of it's on microfiche and, like, papyrus, but I don't know, I thought it would help, you know, to figure out what your dad was working on when he was killed. 
 See? 
 I knew you were a hugger. 
 So. What do you got so far? 
 It was a clever cover-up. 
 But what kind of robber would be so well connected? You know? 
 CHLOE:  They gave Joe Fields everything he needed to pose as my father's killer. 
 I mean, he confessed. 
 And he had the gun that was used in the shooting. 
 Ballistics confirmed that it was the murder weapon. 
 Well, yeah. No wonder it was case closed. 
 Yeah. I-I... These prints are un-I.D.'d from the scene, but they could be the killer's. 
 And did they ping anyone in the database? 
 No. Dead end. 
 All right. 
 Maybe I can dig a little deeper. 
 So, tell me. 
 Why would I help you two? 
 LUCIFER:  Because we're just two regular fellows who need your help, Boris. 
 I don't believe you. 
 Mr. Sokolov... 
 People call me human lie detector because I look in my clients' eyes, and I can know if they're telling the truth. 
 LUCIFER:  Well, I respect that, Boris. I have a trick myself, that's quite similar, actually. And you're right. We haven't told you the whole truth. So... here it goes. I want someone dead. 
 Who? 
 LUCIFER:  Lucifer Morningstar. 
 And what has this person done to deserve death? 
 LUCIFER:  Well, he hurts people. And not just his enemies, those close to him, as well. In fact, I think he hurts them most of all. 
 He's right. The guy's violent, he's a total loose cannon. 
 LUCIFER:  Yes. Believe me, when I say, Boris, that the world would be a better place without him. 
 You both have true hatred for this man. 
 LUCIFER:  Apparently so. Do we have a deal? 
 [sniffs] 
 Go and take care of this Lucifer person. 
 I'll find you your patsy. 
 LUCIFER:  Lovely. 
 I hear you won't talk. 
 Okay. 
 We have hard evidence linking your bank account to two different murders. 
 What do you have to say about that? 
 I heard you're a human lie detector, is that true? 
 [clears throat] 
 One of those murders was my father. 
 It's why I'm not on the case and it's why I'm not supposed to be in this room talking to you. 
 But I'm not a cop right now, Boris. 
 I'm a daughter. 
 [inhales] And I'm not gonna let this go. 
 So, you point me in the right direction... or I swear to God, I'm gonna make your life a living hell. 
 I believe you. 
 CHLOE:  His name was John Decker. 
 I admit to nothing but I did once hear about a John Decker. And as I recall, he was sniffing somewhere he didn't belong. 
 CHLOE:  What do you mean? My father was a beat cop at a robbery gone wrong. 
 Hey, man. 
 I just want to say nice work earlier. 
 Was it? Yeah. 
 We got Boris. 
 And I don't know how you lied to him like that. 
 LUCIFER:  Well, it's simple. I didn't lie. 
 Well... [sighs] 
 Well, then you have some serious issues, bro. 
 LUCIFER:  Obviously. I mean, why do you think I'm doing all this Dan-ing? 
 [chuckles] Yet, you know, I'm still no closer to figuring out your secret. 
 LUCIFER:  Because I don't have a secret. 
 Well, you must. 
 One that explains how you're able to be so... you know, frustratingly you. 
 You see, man... 
 Hmm? 
 I try to compliment you, and... 
 [quietly]: Hey. 
 I think my father's death was a hit. 
 I-It sounds like he stumbled onto something huge, and-and someone took him out for it. 
 Chloe, do you want me to help you with this? 
 No. I-I... I got it on this end. But thank you. 
 Well. [chuckles] 
 Where to now, Twinsy? Hmm?

 No. I just... 
 I can't find the right job. 
 My only friend stopped talking to me. 
 "Only"? 
 [soft laughter] 
 What's all of this? 
 My dad's stuff from storage. 
 After he died, the department boxed up his desk and sent it to us. 
 You find anything? 
 Not yet. 
 One of the cases he assisted on got him killed, and I have to figure out which one it is, but... 
 It's funny, he always talked about how he didn't want to be a detective, how it was too much work, and yet... here he was doing all this detective work. 
 Guess the apple doesn't fall far from the tree. 
 Hmm. 
 I tried a bunch of stuff, but... after my dad died, this just felt right. 
 Yeah, but like... how do you know what  feels  right? 
 Mm... 
 You just know.

 Dan : You too, pal. 
 Detective Douche! 
 How dare you subject me to this pathetic caricature? 
 You have the nerve to stand there and accuse me of making fun of you, after everything you've done in the last couple days. 
 Hell, ever since we first met. 
 Detective Douche, I... 
 Dan! My name is Dan. 
 Or Detective Espinoza. 
 Right. 
 Dan. 
 I only did it because you're everything that I'm not. 
 Boring, helpful. 
 Your life is simple. 
 [scoffs] Oh. 
 My life? 
 Yes. 
 Come on, man. You're rich. You're handsome. 
 You drive fancy cars, you date hot girls. 
 You have no kids, you have no responsibilities. 
 How much more simple can life get? 
 Afraid you don't know the whole story. 
 Well, fine. Tell me. 
 [chuckles softly] 
 You see, that's just it, Dan. 
 The last person I opened up to, I hurt. 
 A lot. 
 Let alone how I've hurt my own flesh and blood. 
 ♪ ♪ 
 [exhales, scoffs] 
 [sighs] 
 It's all I seem to be able to do. 
 Welcome to the club. 
 You think Chloe divorced me because I'm a perfect guy? 
 I did a lot of things that I'm not... proud of, man. 
 And I'm just trying to work through them. 
 What, through mime? 
 What do you do, stuff your feelings in a box and throw away the key? 
 It's not mime. 
 It's improv. 
 And I started the class after the divorce because I needed a distraction. 
 Perspective. 
 A way to step out of my own skin for a bit. I don't know, I... 
 I'm not a spontaneous guy. 
 I don't live in the moment like you do. 
 So, you were trying to learn how not to Douche. 
 [chuckles] 
 Yeah, I guess that's one way to put it. 
 [both laughing] 
 Don't tell Chloe. 
 All right? 
 [chuckles] 
 Oh. 
 [knocks on door] 
 Oh, it's you. Hello, Detective. 
 I got your message. 
 Oh, hi. 
 Feeling back to your old self? 
 I suppose. So I doubt I'll be of much help. 
 Ooh. On second thoughts, it looks like I came at just the right time. 
 I've have nothing to say to you. 
 Thanks to you, I lost my friend. 
 Friend? What friend? 
 The doctor. 
 I was just working through some stuff. 
 I didn't think that showing... 
 See, that's the problem. 
 I wish for just one second you would  think  about someone other than yourself. 
 And there we have it, ladies. 
 My wake of destruction. 
 Anyone else you need harmed, hmm? 
 Okay, Lucifer? Enough. 
 I'm close to something, I can feel it. 
 Help. 
 Fine. 
 Actually, there is something that's been bugging me, Detective. 
 Do you mind if I play the me's advocate for just a second? 
 Go ahead. 
 Well, there's one part of this puzzle that just doesn't fit. 
 Joe Fields. 
 Wha... why doesn't he fit? 
 Well, you said that he smiled at you when he was released. 
 Yeah, I forgot about that. 
 So, why would an innocent man smile at the daughter of a man he took the fall for killing? 
 He wouldn't. 
 What are you looking for? 
 The prints that Ella found on Fields' transport van. 
 But those only gave us Rodney Lam. 
 But there were other prints. 
 But they cleared as prison personnel. 
 Like Deputy Warden Perry Smith. 
 These are his prints. 
 What, you think the warden did it? 
 Well, deputy wardens are desk jockeys, bureaucrats. 
 So his prints shouldn't have been there. 
 Yes. What if Fields wasn't smiling at me? 
 What if he was smiling at the person next to me? The warden? 
 So you think that Joe Fields and the warden had some kind of deal? 
 Yes. 
 What, Fields serves 16 years... as a fall guy and then suddenly has a change of heart? 
 Well, he had a grandkid. Maybe he got sick of the deal, told the warden he wanted out? 
 And the warden said yes, but only as a ploy to kill Fields. 
 Right. 
 [typing on keyboard] 
 Deputy Warden Perry Smith worked in the prison system for 20 years. 
 Started as a guard. He's our guy. 
 Let's go. 
 Right, well, wouldn't Dan be more helpful? 
 What? 
 If I'm gonna take this guy down, I need my partner and that's you. Lucifer Morningstar. 
 [soft chuckle] 
 Right. 
 Good-bye! 
 I guess I'll just clean up. 
 I'm dressed for it, apparently. 
 [siren wailing] 
 [indistinct radio chatter] 
 It looks like the cavalry's arrived. 
 Dan, what's happening? 
 I'm so sorry, Chloe. 
 The warden gave us the slip. 
 What? 
 Lucifer :  Are you okay, Detective? 
 This whole time, my father's killer's been out there. 
 And today I let him get away. 
 So, no, I feel like a failure. 
 What... you are nothing of the sort. 
 Detective, for the first time in 16 years, you know who the real killer is. 
 It seems to me that justice is in your sights. 
 You're right. 
 I put out a BOLO. 
 FBI and DHS are looking at airports, border crossings. 
 Well, I've still no idea what that means, but it sounds good. 
 It means I'm gonna get the son of a bitch. 
 Right. Well... in the meantime, since your offspring's with Dan... 
 What? 
 I'm simply suggesting that you open a bottle of wine, or three, for yourself, and just have a nice... 
 [muffled grunting] 
 [man groans loudly] 
 Shut up! 
 [coughing] 
 Lucifer [laughing] : Well... 
 Bravo, Maze. 
 How did you get... 
 I was bored. 
 Had nothing to do. 
 So, I tracked down the scumbag myself. 
 It just... felt right. 
 It's gonna feel good to call this in. 
 Lucifer : What? No, hold on, Detective. 
 You have a choice to make here. 
 Yes. 
 So much punishment. 
 Mm. Order off-menu for once. 
 Maze and I certainly won't judge. 
 You took my father away. 
 [crying]: You tore apart my family. 
 [tape rips] 
 [groans] 
 [chuckles] 
 I tried to get him to drop it. 
 But he wouldn't take the hint. 
 That's all you have to say? 
 After everything you've done? 
 No, no, no. No, no, no. I-I'm sorry. 
 I'll give you all the players in my operation. 
 I'll give you money. 
 [shuddered breathing] 
 Oh. 
 We'll see how you do in the prison that you ran. 
 I'll bet your inmates will treat you real nice. 
 No. No, please, please. 
 I can get you whatever you want. 
 All I want is for you to know that John Decker's kid got you. 
 [knocks on door] 
 Maze [through door] : Linda. 
 I know you're in there. 
 I have something to show you. 
 My first check. 
 I got paid. 
 As a bounty hunter! 
 LAPD paid me this finder's fee to track down some human scumbag. 
 Hunting humans is a job. 
 Who knew? 
 First thing I wanted to do was to celebrate with my friend. 
 That's you, Linda. 
 Okay. 
 I just... wanted you to know. 
 [door unlocks] 
 CHLOE:  Maze, how can we be friends? You're a... you're a demon. Lucifer's the Devil. How am I supposed to get over that? 
 He's still the same old Lucifer. 
 You're still Dr. Linda Martin. 
 And I'm still Maze. 
 What's changed? 
 Come on. 
 Let Mazikeen Smith buy you a drink. 
 [chuckles] 
 Maybe I'll devour your soul or something.

 Here you go, monkey. 
 LUCIFER:  Mmm. Yummy. 
 Lucif... 
 LUCIFER:  Mmm. Why should the child go first? I'm far larger. And hungrier. 
 It's okay, Mommy. He must've really wanted it. 
 [Lucifer scoffs] 
 [Chloe giggles] 
 LUCIFER:  Is she always so... her? 
 Baby, it's time to get dressed. 
 [yells] 
 What are you doing? [scoffs] 
 Bye, Lucifer! 
 Yes. 
 LUCIFER:  [exhales]: Yes. I don't care much for my dad. But... you clearly... care about yours. 
Which is why you followed in his footsteps, I suppose. 
 Hmm. 
 [sighs] 
 LUCIFER:  So, w-what I'm trying to say is... I think he would be proud of you. Oh. My apologies, Detective. I didn't mean to hurt you. 
 No, no, it's... 
 LUCIFER:  Wh... Then why are you... crying? 
 [sighs] 
 Just... Oh, just shut up. 
 What...
