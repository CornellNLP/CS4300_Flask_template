 Lemuel : You got to tease him, see? 
 Fish sees that lure moving around like a nice tasty frog. 
 He's got no idea it's you. 
 Then you get him. 
 Okay. 
 Hold that. 
 But you can't ever let him know who or what you are. 
 You understand? 
 I just picked this up in town. 
 All right. 
 New film. San Francisco. 
 Bring to me. 
 [click] 
 [knock on door] 
 Sweetheart. Ha ha. 
 You okay? 
 I, uh, I need to talk to you. 
 Both of you. 
 All right, Juliana, what is this about? 
 Trudy. 
 Have you seen her? 
 She's dead, Ma. 
 What? 
 Um... she was shot by the Kempeitai. 
 No, no. 
 No, no. This... There must be some mistake. 
 No. 
 There isn't. 
 She got mixed up with some guy from the Resistance, and someone told the Japanese. 
 Juliana, who told you this? 
 Someone who saw her body. 
 Well, I don't believe it. 
 Anne... 
 No. I don't care what she says. 
 She's gone, Ma. 
 Your sister is here. 
 I can feel it. 
 [knock on door] 
 [knocking] 
 [sigh] 
 Ed? 
 Ed? Hey, what's wrong? 
 The Kempeitai are at the factory. 
 They had me convert a replica. 
 What? 
 Bore out the barrel, everything. 
 Oh, sh1t. 
 They must think the gun that shot the Crown Prince was made in our shop. 
 You've got to get out of here, Frank, before they arrest you. 
 Yeah, yeah. Well, I was planning on it. 
 When? 
 Tonight. The 11:00 bus. 
 You've got enough money? 
 Not yet, but I will. 
 Can you do me a favor? 
 Anything. 
 Can you pick up the tickets? 
 They might be watching the station. 
 I've got to get back. 
 Uh, let me give you some money. 
 No, uh, I've got it. 
 You and Jules are going to need all the money you can get. 
 Ed. 
 There's no way to thank you. 
 That'll be 2.65 yen, hon. 
 Joe : I'll get that. 
 Just keep the change. 
 Just like old times, huh? 
 Take a seat. 
 What are you doing here? 
 What do you think? 
 They send you to get the film? 
 Yeah. And don't whisper. 
 Just keep it low. 
 How'd you find me? 
 I followed you. 
 I followed you until I made sure you weren't being followed yourself. 
 What for? 
 I need your help. 
 Joe, I can't. 
 I can't be involved in this. 
 There must be someone that you know. 
 Someone that helped your sister. 
 I need this, Juliana... more than anything. 
 I see evidence of sand casting. 
 I left that deliberately, just smoothed it where rubbing against the Chief's skin would have polished it. 
 That's... That's excellent work. 
 And so fast. 
 Well, I'm motivated. 
 What? 
 When you approached me about this, I was... somewhat agitated. 
 You're not going to back out on me, Childan. 
 I understand that you're highly motivated, Mr. Frink, but I'm not sure you appreciate the gravity of the situation. 
 What gravity? 
 Selling a forgery to high-placed Japanese... 
 Were this to go awry, I... we could face summary execution. 
 Hey, listen, you're going to f*cking sell this, or I'm going straight to the Kempeitai and tell them about the bullets you sold me. 
 You wouldn't dare implicate yourself. 
 You just watch me. 
 Wait. 
 I have a nervous disposition. 
 Just allow me a passing moment of anxiety. 
 There. Over. 
 My greed has returned undiminished. 
 I will try to set up the appointment. 
 Not try. You sell it, and today. 
 Ahem. 
 Good morning. Um, I'm looking for three yellow daisies. 
 I was wondering when you'd finally turn up. 
 I, uh, I got that job at the Nippon Building. 
 We heard. Working for the Trade Minister. 
 That's pretty impressive. 
 Yeah. 
 I guess you never found him. 
 Find who? 
 Sakura Iwasaru. 
 Whoever it was betrayed Randall and Trudy. 
 Uh, no. 
 Keep looking. 
 It would be a big help to us. 
 I hear there's a new film. 
 Oh, yeah? 
 Where'd you hear that? 
 There's a guy looking for it... an operative from New York. 
 He knows me from Canon City. 
 I know you, too, but that's not the way it works. 
 He asked me if I had any contacts. 
 Said he's got resources. 
 What exactly did you tell him? 
 I didn't tell him anything. 
 You sure? 
 Yeah. Look, if you don't want to trust him, I get it, but he saved my life, so I do. 
 If we need help from the East Coast, we know how to get it, and it's not by going through you. 
 I'll see you around. 
 Could you please tell Erin I'm very sorry I can't make it this morning? 
 Thank you kindly. 
 The garden club? You never miss that. 
 Thomas has an appointment with Dr. Adler. 
 Girls? 
 It's dumb. 
 I fell in wrestling, and the school nurse made a big deal out of it. 
 That the same nurse who wouldn't let you swim when you had hay fever? 
 Nurse Krendle. 
 Rhymes with Grendel. Know who that was? 
 The monster in Beowulf. 
 I got an A in Aryan literature, remember? 
 Don't brag, Thomas. 
 Look, you go. I... 
 I'll take him to Dr. Adler. 
 Are you sure? 
 Yeah. Can't have my wife miss garden club. 
 You are a wonderful husband, John Smith. 
 Hey, none of that mushy stuff in front of your son, please. 
 Get in the car, young man. 
 On the way we can discuss a math grade that was not something to brag about. 
 Aw... 
 [door closes] 
 [exhale] 
 Sorry. I didn't mean to scare you. 
 You're late. 
 My truck got a flat tire. 
 Slowed me down. 
 But no problems at the border? 
 Why are you so jumpy? 
 Why aren't you? 
 You mean because he sent me? 
 It's not normal. 
 You got the money? 
 10,000 yen. 
 [engine starts] 
 Oh, God damn it. 
 Damn it. 
 [phone rings] 
 [rings] 
 Man : Listen carefully. 
 We have what you came for. 
 Who is this? 
 Not important who we are. 
 What's important is you want film. 
 And what do you want? 
 100,000 yen. 
 100,000?

 You responded quickly to my call. 
 With the hope you called about something of importance. 
 If you refer to your investigation into the shooting of the Crown Prince, I regret to say I still have no information. 
 Time is running short, is it not, Chief Inspector? 
 For you to apprehend the shooter. 
 Why did you call us here? 
 These films... for the Man In the High Castle. 
 A new one has surfaced. 
 Has it? 
 This is the name of a man in Oakland. 
 He intended to sell the film but, tragically, was murdered. 
 The film in his possession has vanished. 
 What have you done with it? 
 Chief Inspector, please instruct your sergeant to address me with the proper respect. 
 You realize we can shut down your whorehouses, your bars, restaurants, drug trade, whenever we choose. 
 Then there are labor problems at the docks and revelations that high government officials are drug addicts and perverts. 
 Isn't this better, Chief Inspector, doing business as friends? 
 How much do you want? 
 For the Kempeitai, a special price. 
 150,000 yen. 
 You may prey upon the weak and the corrupt, but do not for a moment think you can shake down officers of the Emperor's Kempeitai. 
 Nurse, this is ridiculous. 
 He's been in there over an hour. 
 I'm very sorry, Obergruppenführer. 
 [door opens] 
 My deepest apologies for keeping you waiting. 
 Everything all right? 
 Looks like your boy pulled a muscle. 
 Nothing a little ice won't fix. 
 Told you I was fine. 
 And can I have a word in private? 
 Certainly. 
 Please take a seat. 
 Can we, uh, make this brief, doctor? 
 I'm late for work as it is. 
 No, thank you. 
 Um... this, um... this won't be easy for you to hear. 
 Thomas didn't just pull a muscle wrestling, Obergruppenführer. 
 He had a tremor. 
 A tremor? 
 I wish I could tell you that it was just growing pains, but your son has a serious disease. 
 Landouzy-Dejurine syndrome. 
 The symptoms, vague at first, are loss of coordination, weakness in the arms, difficulty hearing... 
 That's... That's nonsense. 
 My son is the picture of health. 
 I'm afraid he isn't. 
 Within months, perhaps a year, there will be paralysis. 
 That's a mistake, doctor. 
 You're making a mistake. 
 I would never tell you this were I not certain. 
 He scored 10 out of 10 on the indicators in the Brandt-Sievers nerve test. 
 Okay. 
 So what's the... what's the treatment? 
 Obergruppenführer, we're talking about a class A congenital disorder. 
 There is no treatment. 
 What do you mean, there is no treatment? 
 No, I'm not accepting that, no. 
 There's got to be some other tests you can run. 
 I want a second opinion. 
 You have the option, but you should be aware that if he is submitted to others for examination, this becomes an institutional issue. 
 Oh, I see. 
 Yes, of course. 
 By virtue of your position, I feel what must be done can be done in the kinder setting of your home. 
 I will hold your son's file outside the system, give you the time you need. 
 As for, uh, medical assistance... a syringe and an ampule of an effective combination: morphine scopolamine and prussic acid. 
 Absolutely painless. 
 If you like, I can show you how to locate a vein in the back of the hand. 
 [speaking Japanese] 
 These came for you. 
 Arigato. 
 You are late, Miss Crain. 
 Yes. I'm sorry. Here. 
 Allow me. 
 Leave it. 
 Mr. Kotomichi, please forgive me if I've done something to offend you. 
 You have done nothing to offend me, Miss Crain. 
 It is your presence. It brings danger. 
 You cannot know what he risked giving you employment. 
 Look, I don't wish to harm him. 
 And yet you will. 
 [speaking Japanese] 
 Good morning, Miss Crain. 
 These are for you. 
 [whispering in Japanese] 
 I see from your file that you studied geography in school. 
 Yes, among other things. 
 I have an assignment for you, Miss Crain. 
 It is sensitive by nature and requires your utmost discretion. 
 I'm honored. 
 A general from Tokyo will arrive tomorrow. 
 He seeks information about uranium deposits in the Neutral Zone. 
 What kind of information? 
 Size and location of unexplored deposits. 
 I believe there hasn't been a survey since the war. 
 Hmm. 
 Might I have permission to leave the building, Trade Minister? 
 Why, may I ask? 
 The library possesses all geographical surveys. 
 Um, I thought maybe they would be of use. 
 You visited the address I gave you? 
 It was as you said it would be. 
 I am sorry for your loss. 
 Not just my loss. 
 [sighs] 
 Go on, Miss Crain. 
 Arigato. 
 Hello. 
 Hello? 
 You come here alone? 
 Yeah. Of course. 
 It's clear. 
 What the hell are you doing here? 
 Take one guess. 
 Look, I can't help you. 
 We need you to take us to your friend Joe Blake. 
 [knock knock] 
 Yes? 
 What is it, Captain? 
 Sir, Oberstgruppenführer Heydrich has just entered the building. 
 Heydrich? 
 Are you sure? 
 I'm surprised myself, sir, but he's on his way up now. 
 All right, send him in. 
 No need. Here I am. 
 Oberstgruppenführer, what a surprise. 
 You should have told me you were coming. 
 I'd have prepared a hero's welcome. 
 That is precisely why I didn't. 
 This is a working vacation. 
 Lina has come for the children. 
 Hmm. 
 I have achieved much under the leadership of the Führer, John. 
 The eradication of the Semites in Europe, the enslavement of the African continent. 
 You are the man with the iron heart. 
 A title I wear proudly. 
 But, as I've grown older, I've come to realize nothing is more important than family. 
 No. 
 I've rented a cottage in East Hampton. 
 Our families must meet. 
 Your children... sprechen sie schon Deutsch? 
 Better than me, certainly. 
 Ah. I seem to recall. 
 Still, it hasn't inhibited your advancement, has it? 
 The Führer places great faith in you, John, to collect these films of his. 
 Yes, he does. 
 I understand terrorists claimed the life of Hauptsturmführer Lautz and very nearly yours. 
 Yes. 
 My aide is still in the hospital. 
 Critical condition. 
 You've made no arrests? 
 Oh, yes. One. He died in custody. 
 So you still don't know how they got to you. 
 Not yet, no. 
 Thank you, Captain. 
 
 
 
 What are you doing here, Reinhard? 
 And don't tell me it's a family vacation. 
 I think you can guess, John. 
 It's Rudolph Wegener. 
 I gather you've extracted no confession about his activities in San Francisco? 
 What's your business with him? 
 I've come to take him into custody. 
 He's my prisoner. 
 You forget with whom you are speaking. 
 Wegener answers to Goebbels, not you. 
 I will take him nonetheless. 
 My men will be here within the hour. 
 I look forward to spending some time together while I'm here, John. 
 Maybe we can do a little hunting. Hmm? 
 [knock on door] 
 [sigh] Am I glad to see you. 
 Did you talk to them? 
 Yeah, except they made me bring them to you. 
 I didn't expect you. 
 That puts us even. 
 I, uh, told them you had resources. 
 What do you need? 
 100,000 yen. 
 That's a lot of ramen. Why so much? 
 To pay the Yakuza. 
 You've got to be kidding me. 
 They took the film from the man who was going to sell it to us. 
 He's lying dead on a bench in Sutro Heights. 
 Can you get that much? 
 Yeah, I can get it. 
 [doorbell rings] 
 Yes? 
 Robert Childan to see Mr. and Mrs. Kasoura. 
 Regarding? 
 I've brought a piece of art they wish to see. 
 Do you remember me? I was here for dinner. 
 Use the tradesman's entrance, please, just around the side. 
 No, I'm not a tradesman. 
 I'm awaited by the Kasouras. 
 And I've had instructions. 
 The housekeeper will let you in the service entrance. 
 I was a guest before, and I'm a guest now, damn it. 
 Problem here? 
 Uh, no. 
 No problem. 
 Uh, I'll use the side entrance. 
 Thank you. 
 Captain Connolly, you continue to surprise me. 
 Sir? 
 You knew how our guest takes his coffee: black with four cubes of sugar. 
 Thanks to Oberstgruppenführer Heydrich's office in Berlin. 
 His adjutant told me how he takes his coffee. 
 So you did know he was coming. 
 No. I simply exchange information with him as a matter of course. 
 So when you go to Berlin, he'll know exactly how you take your coffee, too. 
 Well, I commend you on your attention to detail. 
 Where are you going? 
 To talk to Colonel Wegener. 
 Would you like me to accompany you? 
 That won't be necessary. 
 Hello, Rudolph. 
 I never expected to see you again, John. 
 Nor I you. 
 You're to be taken into custody, Rudy... by Oberstgruppenführer Heydrich. 
 Heydrich. 
 He flew all the way from Berlin... expressly to see you. 
 I don't suppose you'd care to tell me why. 
 Rudy, you realize I could have had you tortured. 
 The only reason you're alive right now is because of me. 
 I realize. 
 You think you'll fare better under Heydrich? 
 Of course not. 
 So tell me what you did. 
 Tell me what you did before... before it's too late. 
 If I tell you, then what? 
 I'll try to help you. 
 While you attempt to mitigate the damage of my treason? 
 Yes, of course. 
 I'm prepared to die, John. 
 I prefer it... to breathing one more breath under service to the State. 
 What happened to you, Rudolph? 
 We have blood on our hands. 
 Yes. 
 We spilt blood. 
 We spilt blood. 
 And I'd spill it again to protect my family. 
 Is that what you think you've done? 
 You can live in your world, John... if you can stand it. 
 I can't. 
 Not anymore. 
 Goodbye, Rudy. 
 Childan : This is indeed a first. 
 It's unique, singular. 
 The personal treasure of a true American legend. 
 Now, as you hold this, think that anything that once graced the neck of this mighty chief... every amulet, every beaded wrist band, even the clothing worn by an Indian warrior such as he... is endowed with spiritual power. 
 Here it is in the photograph, absolving any question of authenticity. 
 It's very small in photo. 
 That's exactly what I thought when I first was it, so I had this done, this fine grain enlargement. 
 If I cannot authenticate, I have no right to be in business. 
 Still, it shows very little detail. 
 But it's clearly the necklace. 
 But is this truly proof? 
 Excuse Paul. He's a lawyer. 
 I am not unaware that, for some Americans, there's a sense of victory in deceiving the Japanese. 
 Mr. Kasoura, I would never... 
 Please, a careful examination of that necklace and the photos offer proof. 
 Wu. 
 [speaking Japanese] 
 [speaking Japanese] 
 This necklace has wu. 
 I can feel it. 
 This is from someone who has known great sorrow. 
 You know that this belonged to a noble man whose people were annihilated. 
 Do you see the sadness in those eyes? 
 [knock knock] 
 Okay. We have a deal. 
 Lemuel : When? 
 Tonight at 10. 
 A place called The Bamboo Palace. 
 Can you get the money by then? 
 I'll get it. 
 Wait. 
 The Yakuza would sooner kill you than hand over that film. You realize that? 
 We'll take our chances. 
 Okay, then. 
 Hey, wait a second. 
 When am I going to see you again? 
 You won't. 
 There are things I want to say to you. 
 I can't do this, Joe. 
 [sob] 
 Juliana. 
 Frank's a lucky guy. 
 What's that cop doing out there? 
 Uh, I don't know. 
 Nothing to do with me. 
 Did you sell it? 
 Hey, did you sell it? 
 Yes, yes. Here. 
 Your share's all there. It's 46,000 yen. 
 You fooled him, huh? 
 Yeah. 
 He wasn't sure at first, but, uh, evidently, you have wu. 
 Great pain and suffering. 
 Well, that I got plenty of. 
 Listen, are you sure that cop's got nothing to do with you? 
 Yeah, yeah, I'm sure. Why? 
 Why? 
 Because we just made a boatload of money, my friend. 
 With my salesmanship and your skills, we can make a boatload more. 
 We could, but we won't. 
 It was good doing business with you, Childan. 
 It's time for you to go. 
 Come on. 
 I won that. 
 No, I won. 
 I did it. 
 How'd it go? 
 I ran the, uh... extra 2 kilometers, they said. 
 You see? I knew you had it in you. 
 You keep it up. 
 May I, uh... 
 May I clean up for dinner? 
 Well, you'd better. 
 Thank you, Mother. 
 Well done. 
 You push him too hard. 
 I do nothing of the kind. 
 He was tired today. 
 He's a teenager, that's all. 
 What did Dr. Adler say? 
 He, uh, pulled a muscle. 
 Our Nurse Krendle is a... a touch overprotective. 
 Hmm. 
 [phone rings] 
 [ring] 
 Smith residence. 
 Oh, hello, Joe. 
 Yeah, he's... he's right here. 
 Well? 
 Uh, good news, I think. 
 I've made contact with the Resistance here. 
 What do you mean, you think? 
 The film's been taken by the Yakuza. 
 Go on. 
 They're willing to sell it for 100,000 yen. 
 Joe, if I agree to this, you guarantee that they will honor this bargain? 
 Yes, sir. 
 Joe, I need to know that you understand what I'm saying. 
 I do, sir. 
 Good. 
 You'll need to get to the Embassy without being seen. 
 I'll make sure I transfer the funds there for you. 
 Thank you, sir. 
 Thank you for giving me a second chance. 
 [door closes] 
 Frank, Frank, there's a policeman out there. 
 Yeah, I know. He's been there all afternoon. 
 What's he doing? 
 I don't know. Just watching. 
 Look, we got to get out of here. 
 Did you get the money? 
 Right here, and Ed's got the bus tickets. 
 He's going to meet us at Foley Street at 11. 
 At 11? 
 Yeah. Why? 
 Just that the Japanese man who gave me my job has been really kind to me. 
 You can't worry about that, Jules. 
 We've got to worry about us. 
 Come on. 
 We'll start over, some place where our biggest problem is deciding what to name our first kid. 
 Okay. 
 Okay, we'll go see Mom. 
 We'll go see Mama, and we'll go. 
 Jules. Come on, we can't. 
 Frank, I can't just leave without saying goodbye. 
 She just lost a daughter. It'll drive her mad. 
 I... I have to. 
 You're going to tell Arnold we're leaving for the Neutral Zone? 
 All right. 
 All right, we'll go see them one last time, but you can't tell them anything, okay? 
 Okay. 
 I woke up to an empty bed. 
 I couldn't sleep. 
 I could tell something was bothering you. 
 Just a couple of things at work. 
 Look at you and Edmond. 
 You know how lucky you were? 
 I grew up an only child playing with dolls on my own. 
 I worshiped him. 
 Seeing your brother like that, it must have broken your father's heart. 
 Yeah. 
 Well, at least now, when someone is terribly ill, they're not allowed to suffer. 
 That's a blessing. 
 Come back to bed. 
 You got the money? 
 I got it. So what's the drill? 
 I'm doing this, not you. 
 No deal. It's my cash, my job. 
 That's non-negotiable. 
 We'll be waiting right outside. 
 We keep the money in your coat. 
 Check it when you go inside the club. 
 Have yourself a drink. When you leave, the coat checker hands it back to you with the film inside the lining. 
 Okay. 
 Let's do it. 
 [speaking Japanese] 
 Is there anything else that you need, Trade Minister? 
 No. Nothing, Kotomishi. Thank you. 
 Miss Crain never returned this afternoon. 
 No. 
 That was delicious, Anne. 
 I'm glad you thought so. 
 Juliana's barely eaten a thing. 
 Sorry, Ma. 
 I'm just not that hungry. 
 Juliana, I don't expect you to forgive me. 
 It's not up to me to forgive you. 
 I didn't mean for this to happen. 
 You have to believe that I didn't. 
 I know. 
 They promised me. 
 Juliana, they promised me. 
 Now, listen, I... 
 I don't know what you're up to. 
 I don't know how deeply you're mixed up in this, but you listen to me. 
 Whatever it is, tonight you stay away. 
 What are you talking about? 
 We picked up some phone chatter. 
 The Yakuza are selling the film to operatives in the Resistance. 
 The Kempeitai are going to be there, too. 
 Why? 
 To take the film and kill the operatives. 
 Frank, I got to go. 
 I left something at work. 
 Okay. 
 I love you. 
 I love you, too. 
 I'll meet you there, all right? 
 I won't be long. 
 I'll meet... 
 Juliana... 
 I'll meet you there, Frank. 
 Jules... 
 Juliana. 
 I'm sorry. I'll meet you there. 
 That bus leaves in less than an hour. 
 And I'll be on it. Okay? 
 Look, some of my friends are in trouble, Frank. 
 Friends? 
 You mean him, that guy from Canon City. 
 And two other people. Look, Arnold just told me that they're about to walk into a trap, okay? 
 They'll get killed if I don't warn them, Frank. 
 I have to do this. 
 All right? 
 Okay. 
 Don't be late. 
 I won't. 
 Hey, that cop's out there, you know. 
 Yeah. He's following you, not me.
