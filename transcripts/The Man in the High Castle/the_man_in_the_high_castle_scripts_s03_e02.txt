  A kokujin came to my door. 
  He said he was your friend. 
  Lem. 
  The Kempeitai are still looking for him. 
  Did he tell you who he got the films from? 
  Hawthorne said I'm in every one. 
  The films are disturbing. 
  Well, I'd like to see them anyway. 
  [SPEAKS JAPANESE] 
  Difficult. 
  A risk to both of us. 
  Thank you for taking us in. 
  Today I'll I'll find us another place to stay. 
  My late wife and son Nori. 
  [BABY CRYING] 
  You seem to have found a purpose here. 
  Meaning. 
  You are free. 
  JULIANA: Should we take a little nap? 
  TAGOMI: You will see each other again. 
  I am sure. 
  [GASPS] 
  [SIGHS] 
  No. 
  [LAUGHS] 
  I just had a a vision. 
  A memory. 
  I was married to this man. 
  We had a child. 
  In another world, you were my daughter-in-law. 
  The Man in the High Castle he said you and I have a deep connection. 
  That is why I accepted the films. 
  You're a traveler. 
  Like Trudy.

  Helen? 
  I'm leaving. 
  Tell Bridget I'll be home for dinner, all right? 
  The girls will be thrilled. 
  What's wrong? 
  Alice Adler. 
  Mary said that she's been spreading those rumors again about the girls. 
  It's just gossip, Helen. 
  It is not, John. 
  It's not just gossip. 
  Nothing's gonna happen to them. 
  Okay? 
  Don't forget the No, I won't. 
  I'll send a car for you. 
  Erich will take you. 
  He won't know what it's for. 
  [ELEVATOR BELL DINGS]

  METZGER: Not in yet, sir. 
  Agent Matthews from the ARBI is here, sir.

  Agent Matthews. 
  In the flesh. 
  Must be urgent. 
  I followed protocol, sir. 
  - Well? 
  - Five days ago, SD Special Kommandos raided a farmhouse outside Boulder, Colorado. 
  The raid was botched, the Kommandos were killed, and the target escaped. 
  And I'm just now hearing about this? 
  Apologies, sir. 
  I only learned of it myself last night. 
  Streng geheim. 
  Director's eyes only. 
  Who was the target? 
  Only a code name, sir. 
  Lotus Eater. 
  Lotus Eater's current whereabouts? 
  Unknown. 
  Director Hoover is deploying additional assets to the Neutral Zone. 
  And you know this how? 
  I've been assigned. 
  Springtime in the Rockies. 
  Enjoy it. 
  Send us a postcard from time to time. 
  I will, sir. 
  [BEEPING]

  It was nuts. 
  - How are the kids? 
  - Oh, thriving, thanks. 
  Any problems at the checkpoint? 
  So far, so good.

  - 'Cause they're cool. 
  - Cool your heels, dipshit. 
  [PHONE RINGING] 
  I arrested a young vandal. 
  These are everywhere. 
  A nuisance. 
  He volunteered the location of the Resistance cell he runs errands and messages for. 
  He identified the criminal priest Hagan as ringleader.

  JULIANA: Hey, how'd it go today? 
  I'm still here, obviously. 
  Takes time, you know. 
  You got to be patient. 
  That's what Tagomi said. 
  He also said that what we really need to do is let go of each other. 
  Yeah, I'm trying to. 
  Me, too. 
  It's hard. 
  Yeah. 
  Maybe once you see the films, then I'll be able to Did he mention something about the films? 
  - He did? 
  - Tomorrow. 
  Early. 
  He's gonna send his assistant to come get you. 
  [INSECTS BUZZING, BIRDS SQUAWKING] 
  [HORSE WHINNIES] 
  Well, the craftsmanship in these bracelets is just exquisite. 
  And so reasonably priced. 
  You think this turquoise is real? 
  - Why, you don't? 
  - How would we know? 
  Well, more to the point, how will the Pons? 
  Oh, isn't that gorgeous? 
  Oh, yeah. 
  That's a beaut, just like all the others. 
  We're really cornering the market. 
  Listen, there is no such thing as too much top-shelf inventory. 
  The Pons are gonna eat this stuff up with a spoon. 
  I guarantee it. 
  How much do we owe you for the gas, - my good man? 
  - 44 marks. 
  So, twice what we paid last week? 
  [SNIFFS] 
  Tell it to the Yakuza. 
  There's a shortage. 
  I can siphon it back out if you want. 
  No, no. 
  God, no. 
  See you found something you like. 
  - Oh, yeah. 
  - We've seen better, but it'd be churlish to complain. 
  You can ring it up. 
  And, uh, while we're at it, that squash blossom necklace may I see that? 
  My grandfather's. 
  It's not for sale. 
  The silverwork is stunning. 
  Wu. 
  - Wu? 
  - ED: Yeah. 
  Wu means passion, spirit. 
  He's not the churl he seems to be, not completely. 
  Then you understand why it's not for sale. 
  Everything has a price, my friend. 
  How does a hundred marks sound? 
  I guess not. 
  We'll just take these. 
  I feel guilty grieving. 
  - Is that normal? 
  - RYAN: Well, I think it's unnatural not to mourn the death of a child. 
  No matter how noble the circumstances. 
  Well, it seems like weakness. 
  As does being here. 
  Analysis doesn't have the stigma that it once had, you know, as the, uh, the Jewish science. 
  I'm a Jungian. 
  And Jung was an absolute Aryan, - I assure you. 
  - Hmm. 
  Now, what you say in here is privileged. 
  You may speak freely. 
  You know who my husband is? 
  Does he approve? 
  Well, he thinks it may help, help me come to terms. 
  Has he come to terms? 
  He isn't coming apart at the seams. 
  And you are. 
  I know that he's grieving. 
  But he has his duty. 
  And he has to take care of me. 
  Do you and your husband talk about your son? 
  Mm, not everything. 
  Some things are too sensitive. 
  Well That's why you're here. 
  So talk to me. 
  Tell me about Thomas. 
  Tell me about your son. 
  [SIGHS, CHUCKLES] 
  Where do I start? 
  [INDISTINCT SHOUTING] 
  Congratulations, Chief Inspector. 
  Your strategy has been most effective. 
  The Resistance has been crushed. 
  Thank you. 
  And yet the reprisals continue. 
  Mopping up, Admiral. 
  A useful reminder for the natives. 
  You have acquired an American accent, Kido Tai-i. 
  So my wife tells me. 
  [CHUCKLES] 
  You have been here a long time. 
  Ten years, TÃ©itoku. 
  When did you last see your family? 
  They came to visit while I was recovering. 
  [CLEARS THROAT] 
  Before that? 
  My work keeps me here. 
  You should go home more often. 
  Yes, Admiral. 
  The Empire is stretched thin, Kido Tai-i. 
  We need to find a new way. 
  Persuasion, not punishment. 
  Persuade who, TÃ©itoku? 
  The natives of our superior culture, our Japanese way of life. 
  Educate them. 
  Civilize them. 
  Persuade when we can. 
  Punish when we must. 
  Yes, Admiral. 
  A lighter hand, Chief Inspector Kido. 
  A lighter hand. 
  Hello. 
  [TAGOMI SPEAKS JAPANESE] 
  Uh, excuse me for interrupting. 
  It's okay. 
  What are you painting? 
  [LAUGHS] 
  I'm not sure now. 
  I was painting the fleet, but they've moved around, and I'm not so good from memory.

  [SIREN WAILS IN DISTANCE] 
  Hi. 
  How was it today? 
  Fine. 
  Mm. 
  Hard. 
  [LAUGHS] 
  I cried a lot. 
  Talking about Thomas, I I had this, I don't know, visceral feeling that well, he's still alive. 
  Mm. 
  John, do you think ? 
  I think it's I think it's natural to, to feel this way, you know? 
  But, uh No. 
  No, he's gone. 
  The Reichsfuhrer believes in spirits. 
  Spectral phenomena. 
  Hmm. 
  Ghosts. 
  The astral plane. 
  Communicating with the departed. 
  Ouija boards. 
  - Helen. 
  - We could talk to him. 
  In the beyond. 
  Wouldn't that be wonderful if we could? 
  Wouldn't it? 
  Do you think it's possible? 
  Honestly? 
  No, I don't. 
  I'm sorry, Helen, I don't. 
  I do. 
  And I'd like to try. 
  - Helen. 
  - Hmm? 
  The girls miss you. 
  They miss their mom. 
  I miss you, too.

  Progress? 
  Scouring the Neutral Zone. 
  Following every lead. 
  So, no. 
  And have you come to a conclusion how a man my age could overpower and kill three of my elite, my Lebensborn? 
  He had help. 
  HIMMLER [LAUGHS] : Obviously. 
  Resistance? 
  One would assume. 
  We expect a break in the case imminently. 
  Don't let me down, Reichsmarschall.

  METZGER: One of our Yakuza assets in Denver saw an older couple drop off a pair of young women at a downtown hotel. 
  She recognized the car and one of the women. 
  She later saw the young woman get on a bus for San Francisco. 
  Well, put out a description of the car and the couple. 
  Get it across the NZ. 
  - [CLICKS HEELS] 
  - Sir. 
  - You talk to Joe Blake? 
  - Yes, sir, right before he left. 
  Major Raeder dropped off his documents at his hotel yesterday evening. 
  And after that? 
  There's been no sign of Major Raeder, sir. 
  He hasn't been home and he hasn't been seen since.

  [PANTING SOFTLY] 
  [KNOCKING] 
  Where is she? 
  I went to their motel. 
  The Kempeitai were already there. 
  Juliana Crain and her sister have been arrested, Trade Minister. 
  TRUDY: Juliana, - can you hear me? 
  - Yeah. 
  [TRUDY SIGHS] 
  - TRUDY: I'm scared. 
  - I know. 
  They were waiting for me, and I don't know how they knew. 
  Why was he staring at me like that? 
  Because he killed you. 
  What? 
  That's the man who killed my Trudy. 
  Oh, my God. 
  What's gonna happen? 
  They're just gonna let us stew until we get really, really scared. 
  Will they torture us? 
  Not if you answer their questions. 
  [SNIFFLES] 
  What do I tell them? 
  You tell them that you lost your papers. 
  Tagomi-san, though? 
  He gave us a place to stay for the night, because I used to work for him. 
  What about the films? 
  You don't know anything about the films. 
  Or Hawthorne or the Resistance. 
  Nothing. 
  Okay. 
  - Tru? 
  - Hmm? 
  Now would be a good time to travel. 
  - I can't leave you now. 
  - Please. 
  Please. 
  I want you to. 
  Sorry, sis. 
  No way. 
  No, no. 
  ROCKWELL: He's grooming Smith for my job. 
  I can smell it. 
  HOOVER: Well, Smith was never interested in a political position. 
  Oh, he's licking his chops, believe me. 
  No, we got to do something. 
  The Adler affair. 
  Dr. Gerald Adler diagnosed Thomas Smith with a degenerative, inherited neurological disease. 
  Neither Smith nor Adler ever reported the diagnosis as required by law. 
  Who's the carrier? 
  Runs in Smith's family. 
  His son would have been euthanized involuntarily. 
  And would have spared us the sanctimonious heroics. 
  Dr. 
  Adler, in perfect health, dropped dead just before he could blow the whistle, and was then cremated without an autopsy on Smith's orders. 
  A drum that his widow has continued to beat since. 
  - We should listen to widows and orphans. 
  - [LAUGHS] 
  As with most men, Smith's family is his Achilles' heel. 
  Not just the unstable wife, but his two precious daughters may also carry the defect. 
  - And are coming of age. 
  - [CHUCKLES] 
  MAN: You're bound for the Zone, right? 
  SAMPSON: Well, no worries. 
  Won't be used around here. 
  Yeah, see that they're not. 
  No, strictly self-defense. 
  Give me a hand? 
  [GRUNTING] 
  Got yourself a whole lot of self-defense there, brother. 
  Well, you know what they say, pal. 
  Never forget, never forgive. 
  [CROW CAWING] 
  [BIRD SINGING] 
  I told you, Nakamura. 
  I have many skills. 
  Interrogating the dead is not one of them. 
  I am not worthy to replace Sergeant Yoshida. 
  Perhaps not. 
  Before I leave your sight, sir All the bodies have been examined. 
  No sign of the criminal priest Hagan. 
  Find Hagan, bring him to me alive, and you will be my sergeant. 
  If you cannot, resign yourself to a career in the colonial backwater in a conflict zone. 
  If you think San Francisco is miserable in the winter, imagine Manchuria. 
  We've checked every hospital, the morgue, and he's not in custody, sir. 
  Not in our custody. 
  Our sources in SD say Raeder's not in theirs, either. 
  Well, keep looking. 
  - Sir. 
  - [CLICKS HEELS] 
  Oh, Kido Tai-i. 
  TÃ©itoku. 
  Trade Minister Tagomi informs me there has been an unfortunate misunderstanding regarding the gaijin Juliana Crain. 
  She collaborated with the Resistance, and is implicated in the murder of two of my officers. 
  The trade minister has asked me to release the gaijin and her, uh, what is it, sister? 
  Hai, TÃ©itoku, sister. 
  KIDO: TÃ©itoku, the sister of Juliana Crain is deceased. 
  This supposed sister is another matter, and needs to be investigated fully. 
  INOKUCHI: And you are free to do so. 
  In the meantime, please release them both to his custody. 
  Hai, TÃ©itoku. 
  KIDO: Why are you protecting subversives? 
  That is treason. 
  You took the film to New York, risked your life. 
  Treason? 
  The price of peace is high. 
  Then explain to me the paradox of Trudy Walker. 
  I executed her myself. 
  I saw her die. 
  And yet, today, there she was, alive. 
  The answer is simple. 
  She is not the same person. 
  [DOOR OPENS] 
  - Miss Crain. 
  - Tagomi-san. 
  I apologize for not coming sooner, for what happened earlier. 
  It's not your fault. 
  Thank you for coming at all. 
  You're being released to my custody. 
  You and your sister will be under my protection.

  This comes from Alice Adler.

  And his friend? 
  Roger? 
  Oh, I don't judge. 
  I assure you. 
  You don't? 
  No, but I understand how vulnerable you must feel, how susceptible to unscrupulous operators.

  Constant threat of exposure. 
  That's no way to live. 
  No. 
  No, sir, it's it's not.

  Sir, that would be wonderful.

  Just keep doing what you're doing. 
  Just have to let me know what that is.
