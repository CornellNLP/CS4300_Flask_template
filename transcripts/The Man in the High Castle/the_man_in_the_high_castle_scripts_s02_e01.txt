 Ohh! 
 You all right? 
 Yeah, yeah, I'm fine. 
 It's my family. 
 Lucky guy. 
 Yeah. 
 A fella's got to work for something, right? 
 [Knock Knock] 
 Did you guys get that radio working yet? 
 Not yet. 
 Mind if I take a look at it myself? 
 What's the rush, friend? 
 There's a gal who got me on the boat. 
 I need to... make sure she's okay. 
 We'll get that radio working. 
 Don't you worry. 
 He's coming. 
 Who? 
 The guy we answer to. 
 Why did you do it, Juliana? 
 [Sigh] 
 You're in love with him? Is that it? 
 They're going to need a reason, Juliana, a good one. 
 I couldn't... 
 I couldn't take his life, Karen. 
 I couldn't let you, either. 
 Where's Frank? 
 I don't know. 
 I told him someone shot the Crown Prince, then he ran off, I don't know where. 
 Well? 
 She just couldn't... She just couldn't do it. 
 I don't think she meant... 
 Doesn't matter what the hell she meant. 
 Karen : Lem. 
 [Gasp] 
 Does it? 
 You know me, Lem. 
 Yeah. I know you. 
 I don't believe he'd hurt you, any of you. 
 We needed that film. 
 She knew it. 
 None of you watched that film. I did. 
 You take me to the Man in the High Castle. 
 Take me and I can describe it to him frame by frame. 
 You've got a lot of goddamn nerve. 
 Ask him. Ask him if he wants to see me. 
 Already did. 
 You wish to make a statement, Mr. Frink? 
 You know Ed McCarthy... didn't shoot the Crown Prince. 
 I had to do something after... after you killed my sister... and her kids. 
 So you shot him as an act of revenge? 
 You know I did. 
 [Knock Knock] 
 [Whisper] The general has arrived. 
 Aren't you going to arrest me? 
 You did not shoot the Crown Prince. 
 As a Jew, you know I need no charges to order your death. 
 Yeah. Yeah, I know. 
 Then you will accept your friend's confession. 
 Confession? 
 He confessed? 
 I did it, okay? 
 I did it. 
 Okay, look... 
 [Speaking Japanese] 
 I did it, all right? I did it. 
 I'm the one who's supposed to die. 
 Okay? Please. 
 I'm the one who's supposed to die. 
 I'm the one who's supposed to die. 
 General Onoda. 
 I trust you had a pleasant journey. 
 My first time on American soil since the war, Kido Tai-i. 
 Much has changed. 
 Indeed. 
 We must go out, you and I, to see just how much. 
 I understand the North Beach area has excellent hostess bars. 
 So I have been told. 
 Your sergeant tells me there's cause to celebrate. 
 You have a suspect in the shooting of the Crown Prince. 
 The investigation is not yet complete, but yes. The case will be presented tomorrow. 
 Excellent. 
 And a film you were pursuing from the Man in the High Castle. 
 It fell into the hands of the Yakuza. 
 We... 
 I lost it. 
 We shall celebrate, nonetheless. 
 Don't press too hard. 
 Just short strokes back and forth. 
 That's it. 
 Mom, there's a car outside. 
 Uh... I'll go see. 
 Stay with Amy, okay? 
 You see? I'm fine. 
 Just fine. 
 You all right? 
 What happened? 
 Heydrich's in prison, where he belongs. 
 He'll be questioned... and hanged as a traitor. 
 So it's over. 
 Heydrich has allies in Berlin: Men prepared to betray the Führer, just as he was. 
 You have to arrest them. 
 We would if we knew who they were. 
 We can't be sure, and these men are very dangerous. 
 So... you can now... 
 You can give me that gun back now. 
 Hey. 
 What is it? 
 I know that you count on me to be strong. 
 You are strong. You're the strongest person I know. 
 When I thought about turning that gun on our children... 
 If Heydrich had pulled up in that car instead of me... 
 I know that. I know that. 
 But I couldn't have... 
 Our children... I couldn't have. 
 [Radio Signal, Static] 
 Understood. 
 You got that radio working, huh? 
 You're a goddamn Nazi. 
 Yeah. 
 The film. Hand it over. 
 This film. 
 If you drop that, you're dead. 
 How much is the Resistance going to pay you for it? 
 50,000. 
 Look, you guys are being cheated. 
 The Yakuza sold it for twice that, and I got to tell you I don't think the Resistance has the money. 
 Bullshit. 
 Look, you guys need cash. Am I right? 
 To support your families. 
 Come on, that's why you smuggle people like me down to Mexico. 
 What's your point? 
 Shut up. 
 I'm not a Nazi. 
 But I am selling this film to them, and there can be a lot of money in this for you, too. 
 A lot of money. 
 How much? 
 I said shut up. 
 200,000 yen. 
 200,000 each. 
 Frank : I'm the one who's supposed to die. 
 Uhh! 
 [Speaking Japanese] 
 Where is the Trade Minister? 
 I don't know, Chief Inspector. 
 I have been unable to reach him since the... 
 I am here. 
 Are you... quite all right, Trade Minister? 
 Since the war, we have shared an uneasy alliance with the Nazis. 
 Now the Führer is ill, [Voice Fading] and his men boast of their will... 
 Man's voice : We know we must strike before they strike. 
 [Sports Announcer Chatter] 
 Get your hotdogs right here! 
 We got candied apples and... 
 General Onoda : Today we enter the tiger's cave. 
 We enter it because two weeks ago Science Minister Shimura found a capsule in his pocket, and inside the capsule was microfilm smuggled from the Reich Research Council in Berlin. 
 The contents of the microfilm has been confirmed. 
 At long last, we, too, possess the data to build a Heisenberg device. 
 When it is completed, the device must be in range of North American Nazi targets... of New York City. 
 This is our moment. 
 We must not hesitate to seize it. 
 [Applause] 
 Trade Minister. 
 I am all but certain you have passed those plans to the Science Minister with that Nazi colonel. 
 Are you here to arrest me, Chief Inspector? 
 Trade Minister, I know that this is what you wish, and yet you seem... troubled. 
 I wish for parity with the Nazis, to balance the power, to maintain the peace. 
 You heard the general. War is inevitable. 
 Possibly. 
 But with a weapon like this... how can such a war be won? 
 [Plane Overhead] 
 Let's open it up. 
 Oh ho ho ho. 
 [Men Laughing] 
 Mm. 
 Yeah. 
 Mm. 
 Yes. 
 Ha ha ha ha ha! 
 That's their end of the bargain. 
 Get him out of here, Slim. 
 Ha ha ha! 
 Don't spend it all in one place, boys. 
 [Laughing, Whooping] 
 Thank you, man. 
 Whoo. 
 Am I glad to see you. 
 Let's get you to New York. 
 [Sonar Beeping] 
 Okay. 
 Here, here, here, here. 
 [Laughing, Whooping] 
 Where's my bag? 
 Here's your bag. 
 Come on, Captain. 
 Come on, Jack, let's get back fast. 
 [Elevator Door Dings] 
 Good morning, Obergruppenführer. 
 Major Klemm. 
 Obergruppenführer Duncan is eager to speak with you, sir. 
 Has Joe Blake reported in? 
 He's waiting in your office now. 
 Joe. 
 Congratulations. 
 I'm very pleased. 
 Something wrong, Joe? 
 You told me you'd pay those men. 
 They were criminals, Joe. 
 Criminals who wanted you dead. You should feel no remorse. 
 What about Juliana Crain? 
 Oh, she's dead. 
 Almost certainly. 
 It's been nearly 24 hours, Joe. 
 You've proved yourself capable, but in the future you have to learn to keep your feelings in check. 
 I can't do that, sir. 
 Oh, you can't? 
 I'd like to resign. 
 You don't get to resign, Joe. 
 You got your film. 
 Yes. 
 A film of great importance to the Führer. 
 Think about what that means, Joe. 
 Think how proud your father will be. 
 My father doesn't even know I work for you. 
 Oh, of course he does. 
 Now, I stuck with you... because I always believed that when the time came, you'd do what had to be done. 
 This isn't the man I want to be. 
 This isn't the man you wanted to be? 
 I see. 
 Well, it seems I misjudged you, Joe. 
 Major Klemm, what time is my flight to Berlin? 
 It leaves in an hour, sir. 
 Can I go now? 
 Yes, you can go. 
 [Speaking Japanese] 
 You wish to see me, Trade Minister? 
 You told me before to not lose hope. 
 That I should keep meditating. 
 I hoped meditation might bring you peace, as it does me. 
 And nothing more. 
 I went to the park to meditate. 
 But it did not bring me peace. 
 It brought me... to a strange place. 
 It was San Francisco but not this San Francisco. 
 It was ruled by Americans... walking freely, shouting... and laughing. 
 You had a dream of the past. 
 No. No. 
 It wasn't the past. 
 And it didn't feel like a dream. 
 Get a hold of the Crown Princess. 
 Tell her that I have an urgent matter to discuss. 
 
 
 
 [Knock Knock] 
 Arnold : Juliana. 
 [Knocking] 
 Juliana. Hey. 
 Arnold. 
 What happened to you? 
 I just had an accident. 
 You don't want to get that infected. 
 Come on, let me help you. 
 I don't need your help. 
 Are you alone? 
 Yeah, I'm alone. 
 Listen, you guys, you left in such a hurry, I wanted to make sure everything was okay. 
 Where's Jules? 
 She's gone. 
 What's that supposed to mean, she's gone? 
 It means she had to get out of here. 
 Is she safe? 
 No, no thanks to you. 
 I don't know what that's supposed to mean, either. 
 How long have you worked for them, Arnold? 
 In the Nippon Building? 
 How can you do it? How could you live with yourself? 
 Spying on your own people? What kind of man are you? 
 The kind of man that takes care of his family. 
 I tried to help... 
 You didn't take care of your family. 
 You got Trudy killed. 
 God damn you, Frank. 
 I did not get my daughter killed. 
 I tried to help her. 
 You're a f*cking Pon. 
 This is about Ed, isn't it? 
 What do you know about Ed? 
 I'm in a listening room, Frank. 
 I hear everything. 
 I heard his grandfather on the phone. 
 Arnold, you got to help him. 
 I cannot help him. Nobody can help him. 
 Come on. The Kempeitai's got him. 
 Frank... 
 The Kempeitai. 
 I tried to help my own daughter, and look what happened. 
 Oh, come on. 
 You got to leave this alone. 
 You'll need to... 
 You need to find a Pon. 
 Somebody well connected. 
 I don't know any well connected Pons. 
 Then find someone who does. 
 [Radio Plays Music Indistinctly] 
 Well, well, well, Mr. Frink. 
 Have you reconsidered? 
 Reconsidered? 
 Yeah, my offer to place some more authentic Americana with my Japanese clientele. 
 Listen, you got a problem. We both do. 
 What sort of problem? 
 A friend of mine's been arrested for shooting the Crown Prince. 
 Then forced him to confess. 
 So what does that have to do with me? 
 He was caught with a gun. 
 The shells in the chamber were yours. 
 Sumimasen, but I must close. 
 Uh, uh, a sick aunt. Sumimasen. 
 Sumimasen. 
 Sumimasen. 
 What have you done? 
 My friend's not guilty. 
 It's only a matter of time before they come for me to kill me. 
 You must have some wealthy Japanese clients. 
 So what if I do? 
 Well, if you could... I don't know... talk to one of them, get him to pull some strings. 
 Pull some st... Are you out of your mind? 
 Come on. I'm just trying to help you. 
 Help me? It's because of you, Mr. Frink, I'm a dead man. 
 Yeah, you will be a dead man unless we find a way to get my friend out of this. 
 [Gasp] 
 How's that sedative treating you? 
 ["Calendar Girl" On Radio] 
 Mm. I need something to drink. 
 Puzzles. 
 So many puzzles. 
 And you are... just another pretty piece. 
 I was dead. 
 Heh. 
 Maybe you are. 
 What's that supposed to mean? 
 [Laughing] 
 Truth is as terrible as death. 
 But harder to find. 
 You have an unnatural mind. 
 Are you aware of that? 
 You already got one. 
 Right. 
 [Chuckle] 
 Mm. 
 Ohh. 
 Where am I? 
 You answer my questions, chickie, not the other way around. 
 You understand? 
 Yeah. 
 Mm. 
 Come with me. 
 [Humming] 
 '59, '60... 
 [Muttering] 
 You're him, aren't you? 
 I'm Abendsen, Hawthorn Abendsen. 
 This is your castle. 
 [Laughing] This is my castle right here, the conscious and unconscious mind, the psyche. 
 Karl Jung. Got it? 
 [Glass Clinks] 
 [Drink Pouring] 
 That's a home movie. 
 4th of July fireworks in Phoenix. 
 4th of July in 1961. It's not possible. 
 But it is. 
 You're holding it. 
 Abendsen : Tell me about the film you saw. 
 It's like a newsreel. 
 Uh-huh. 
 Juliana : I've never seen anything so... desolate. It was... It was San Francisco, but it was all ruins. 
 I can make out the Golden Gate Bridge. 
 There were shadows of some of the victims. 
 They were like... like burns. 
 It was... 
 The end. 
 [No Audible Dialogue] 
 What about people? 
 What about them? 
 Did you see any after the explosion? Come on. 
 There were men lined up by Nazi soldiers. 
 They looked like they were with the Resistance... partisans... 
 How many? 
 Ten, maybe 12 soldiers. 
 Did you recognize anyone? 
 Why would you ask me that? 
 Just answer the question. 
 My boyfriend Frank. 
 He was executed by, uh, a man, a young man. 
 Joe Blake. 
 I know who he is. I know who they both are. 
 How? 
 Did you recognize anyone else? 
 The man next to Frank. 
 Who was he? 
 I'm not sure. 
 He just looked familiar. 
 Okay. I'm going to show you a face. 
 Tell me if it is the man you saw. 
 That film I saw... is that what's going to happen? 
 Each one of these films show a reality like ours but not ours. [Chuckle] 
 Well, you learn an awful lot watching these films. 
 Some of us are just the same... rotten or kind in one reality, rotten or kind in the next, but most people are different, depending on whether they have food in their belly or they're hungry, safe or scared. 
 So you watch these films. 
 You tell the Resistance what you learn... about the people you see and the things. 
 Things that could happen here, too. 
 That's why... 
 That's why the Nazis want these films. 
 Not the Nazis, just old Adolf. 
 That demented b*st*rd's too paranoid to let anyone else see them. 
 Oh, God. 
 Wait. 
 Was this the man you saw? 
 In the film, he was shot by the Nazis. 
 He was one of the partisans, but here he's... he's a Nazi. 
 So this was the man. You recognize him. 
 I think so. 
 I don't know. 
 You don't know. You don't... 
 You either recognize him, or you don't. 
 I'm not po... I'm not positive. 
 Come on, think! 
 I'm trying. 
 You must have met him somewhere, seen him someplace. 
 Then we're screwed. 
 What are you talking about? 
 That's the reason you're here, chickie. 
 Every film where the Japs won the war, sooner or later San Francisco is wiped out by an A bomb... every one except this one where this b*st*rd dies as a Nazi in an alley somewhere. 
 Are you telling me that if this man can be found, the... we could stop... 
 Yeah. 
 I don't know who he is. 
 [Heavy Breathing] 
 My sister said these films were a way out. 
 Out? 
 She told me she'd found the answer to everything. 
 Yeah. 
 I saw her... a few days ago. 
 She's dead, I know. I know she's dead. 
 But she... she wasn't. 
 Is it possible my sister is alive out there somehow? 
 I said you don't ask questions. 
 You answer them, got it? 
 Why? Why are you so angry at me? 
 Because if you'd seen what I've seen, you'd be angry, too. 
 Wait a minute. Wait a minute. 
 Am I in these films? 
 Why? Why don't... 
 Why don't people ever learn? 
 I am, aren't I? 
 What did you see? 
 Fear and violence! 
 It's who we are. 
 Our whole miserable world, and people like you, you j... you j... you end up... 
 End up how? 
 How do I end up? What about my sister? 
 Answer me! 
 The film of your life... you don't want to see how it ends. 
 [Phone Rings] 
 [Ring] 
 [Ring, Click] 
 Woman : Hello. 
 Is that Mrs. Wegener? 
 Who is this? 
 [Speaking German] 
 This is Tagomi Nobusuke. 
 I met the colonel last year in Stockholm at a trade convention. 
 Would it be possible to speak to him? 
 My husband... is dead. 
 He... 
 [Sobbing] 
 Mm... 
 May I ask what happened? 
 They say he shot himself. 
 He was a traitor. 
 You must know. 
 Your husband died trying to make the world a better place. 
 And did he? 
 Trying is not enough, is it? 
 [Click, Dial Tone] 
 What about this guy Kera? 
 What about him? 
 He works in the Nippon Building. 
 He's a bureaucrat with a taste for sake and Judy Garland memorabilia. 
 All right, this one? 
 Kyoto. No, he's a silk merchant. 
 He moved back to Japan. 
 If I had any sense, I'd be on a bus to the Neutral Zone right now. 
 Then why aren't you? 
 You must have enough money. 
 You ever been to the Neutral Zone? 
 No. 
 Then you have no idea how difficult it would be for a man of culture to survive in an armpit like that. 
 All right, I got it. 
 Paul Kasoura. 
 [Scoff] 
 Yeah, not a chance. 
 Why not? It says he's a lawyer. 
 Lawyers are well connected, aren't they? 
 Yeah, he's indeed a lawyer, but I sold him and his lovely wife Betty that Sitting Bull gorget you made. 
 Yeah, so? 
 So it's a forgery. 
 The last thing we need is any further attention from the Kasouras. 
 Hey, did you hear what I just said? 
 This man's Ed's last chance and yours, too. 
 Now come on. 
 Those guys are Yakuza. 
 Yeah. So I suggest you let me do the talking. 
 [Doorbell Rings] 
 You again. 
 We need to see Mr. Kasoura. 
 Mr. Kasoura does not receive unannounced visitors, and you were told... 
 It's all right, Fred. 
 What is it you want, Mr. Childan? 
 Uh, just a moment of your time, sir. 
 I assure you it will be worth it. 
 Come in. 
 [Speaking Japanese] 
 You are a criminal defense lawyer, are you not, Mr. Kasoura? 
 Yes. 
 I have a case for you, a very important one. 
 You see, this man has a friend who has been falsely accused of attacking the Crown Prince. 
 We do not speak of such things. 
 Of course. Of course. 
 But... But he is innocent. 
 I am absolutely certain of it. 
 What does that have to do with me? 
 Well, don't you see? 
 If the wrong man has been charged with attacking the Crown Prince, there can be no more serious miscarriage of justice. 
 Now, were you to prove this, it would make you yuumei, very yuumei. 
 My clients are private, Mr. Childan. 
 I have no interest in fame, and I certainly have no interest in defending a man accused of attacking the Crown Prince. 
 Forgive a white man's shallow understanding, but surely duty to empire dictates... 
 You must leave now. 
 Mr., uh, Mr. Childan, he sold you this neck plate... for 80,000 yen. 
 Yes? 
 An excellent price for such a... 
 It's a fake. 
 Frank. 
 Why do you say that? 
 Well, uh, because, uh... because I made it. 
 [Laughter] He's lying. 
 No, I'm not. 
 I left the edges unpolished. 
 Um... here and here, to fool even the most experienced collector like you. 
 Uh, this man is clearly deluded. 
 The stress of seeing his friend accused. 
 Our sincerest apologies, Kasoura-san. 
 We'll leave now. 
 You're going nowhere. 
 [Thump] 
 You missed the turnoff. 
 I didn't miss anything. We're going to Stockton. 
 Abendsen said not to kill her. 
 I don't care what Abendsen said. 
 [Gun Cocks] 
 She's seen his face now. 
 Karen : I am not okay with this. 
 I'm not asking your permission, Karen. 
 Since when did you get so soft? 
 [Knocking] 
 Sounds like someone's up. 
 We got to pull over now. 
 That's Kempeitai. 
 That's all right. Just keep moving. 
 sh1t.

 No. 
 [Speaking Japanese] 
 Gary, stop! Don't! 
 Aah! 
 [Gunfire] 
 Gary. 
 Oh, sh1t. All right. Hold... 
 [Gurgling] 
 Oh. 
 [Sentry Moaning]
