 ["Star-Spangled Banner" Playing] 
 [Chatter] 
 Michiko. 
 Michiko. 
 [Chatter Continues] 
 Oh, hey. 
 What's with the suit? 
 What is this? 
 Mom promised we could use this place for our meeting. 
 Meeting? 
 Uh, Dad, my friends are counting on me. 
 Please don't make me go back on my word. 
 Keep your word. 
 We're good, guys. 
 Come on. 
 Honey, come quick. 
 Huh? 
 He's learning to wave back. 
 What? 
 Did you wave? You did. 
 You learned how to wave, Donny? 
 Yeah, he started waving in the car. 
 Good job. That's amazing, buddy. 
 Yeah. Show him. 
 Should we take a little nap? 
 Just a little one? 
 Good morning, O-to-san. 
 Good Morning, Miss... uh, Juliana. 
 You seem different somehow. 
 Different? How so? 
 I don't know. 
 You seem really well. 
 Everybody, this is Nori's dad. 
 Hi. 
 Hello. 
 [Chuckle] 
 Hey, thanks for letting us use the place. 
 We have so much to do. 
 Juliana. 
 Yeah. 
 What is this meeting for? 
 It's one of our Ban the Bomb meetings. 
 I'm really glad you're here. 
 Look, I just need to know that it's over, George. 
 I can't just assume finding you is enough to stop what I saw happen in the film. 
 As simple as that, just pick up my direct line to the Castle? 
 I've got a better chance of collect calling Grace Kelly. 
 I sent a message. 
 We haven't heard back yet. 
 Word is he's gone AWOL again. 
 So... how was dinner? 
 You could almost forget they're Nazis. 
 It won't work coming at the Smiths straight on, so my people want you to take a more indirect approach. 
 Oh no, I'm not taking any approach. 
 The Smiths are not why I'm here. 
 We've been over that. 
 Let me talk to your people, okay? 
 Explain the situation. 
 Now, see, that's something a Nazi spy would say. 
 We've been over that, too. 
 Your pop saved my life. 
 Risking it to give you another chance feels like payback, but I'm not gonna ask my people to risk theirs. 
 I didn't know that... about you and my father. How did he save your life? 
 [Scoff] 
 Nope. 
 We're not gonna do that. 
 You've got to go a long way to earn my trust. 
 George, I am not a Nazi. 
 Well, that's... that's the thing. 
 We're gonna need you to become one. 
 Helen Smith may not act it, but she is the queen bee of the Nazi social scene. 
 The wives, girlfriends of top Nazis suck up to her. 
 So you're going to suck up to them. 
 Look, I did what you asked, okay? 
 I went there, and I smiled, and I pretended everything was fine, and all I wanted to do was scream. 
 We're looking at this... you... as a long-term investment. 
 You'll never be really close to the Smiths unless their friends accept you. 
 You think women like Helen's friends are going to welcome me? 
 Once you're in with the Smiths, you'll be considered a curiosity. 
 Or competition. George, you don't know the first thing about women, do you? 
 [Scoff] Well, that may be true, but it's the deal keeping you alive. 
 Are you sure about this, Jennifer? 
 Yes, I'm sure. Mrs. Pack said. 
 Well, that means your ballet finishes at exactly the same time Thomas' wrestling practice starts. 
 I don't mind missing piano. 
 That's very noble of you, Amy, but your piano is on a completely different day. 
 Don't they understand how difficult it is to figure out a schedule for three kids? 
 How... How can I be two places at once? 
 Thomas keeps saying he's a man now. Why can't he walk? 
 Smith : Don't worry. We'll work it out. 
 That is easy to say, John, but how exactly? 
 [Door Opens] 
 What is it, son? 
 I, um, I got a letter. 
 What does it say? 
 It's from the Commander's Office. 
 Ten Hitler Youth members have been selected to go on a month-long expedition, "to civilize and educate those unfortunates living outside the Reich." 
 I've been chosen to go. 
 To the Neutral Zone? 
 To South America. 
 Well, that's, uh... that's quite an... that's quite an honor, son. Congratulations. 
 Jennifer : When do you go? 
 He's not going. 
 What? 
 Helen... 
 Thomas, I'm... I'm sorry. 
 I am very proud of you, obviously, but this... it's out of the question. 
 Isn't it? 
 Uh, why, um, why is it out of the question? 
 We'll discuss it later. 
 There's nothing to discuss. 
 I thought you'd be pleased. 
 I said later. 
 Whoa. 
 You need not eat it all. 
 I wanted you to have a choice. 
 In future, you'll let me know which dishes you particularly enjoy. 
 Uh, thank you, Silvia, but you don't have to wait on me like this. 
 But I want to. 
 Hmm. 
 Thank you. 
 Where's my father? 
 The Reichsminister had to leave early, but he has a car waiting for you. 
 He cleared his schedule to spend the day showing you Berlin. 
 You'll need to change. 
 Was the suit I laid out for you not to your liking? 
 Oh. That. 
 Heusmann's family. 
 Your parents... were never married. 
 After your mother took you, your father met Margot. 
 They were very happy, and they had two handsome  Boys : Dieter and Rolf. 
 I see. 
 Where are they now? 
 They were killed in an Allied bombing raid outside of Hanover. 
 Were there others, or am I the only one he has left? 
 This is not something I can answer. 
 You should speak with the Reichsminister. 
 [Doorbell Rings] 
 Julia. 
 Helen. Hi. 
 I just wanted to say thank you so much for dinner. 
 I had such a great time. 
 Oh, it's sweet of you to come all the way over. 
 You could have just called. 
 Oh, I just wanted to bring you this. 
 That's very sweet. 
 [Women Laughing] 
 I'm sorry. I've come at a bad time. 
 That's just bridge club. 
 Bridge. I always wanted to learn how to play. 
 Maybe you could teach me some time? 
 The girls would love to meet you. 
 Uh, why don't you come in? 
 I... Okay. Thank you. 
 Girls, this is Miss Julia Mills. 
 Uh, Mrs. Alice Adler. 
 I'm sorry for your loss. 
 Mrs. Mary Dawson and Mrs. Lucy Collins. 
 Juliana : Hello. 
 Sorry for interrupting your game. 
 Oh, don't be silly. 
 The girls are just trying to distract me anyway. 
 Would you like some coffee, sweetheart? 
 Thank you. 
 Okay. 
 Julia wants to learn to play. 
 She's just moved here from the out West... Seattle. 
 They don't have bridge in the Pacific States anymore? 
 We play Mahjong. 
 I suppose those Japs made you give up everything when they came marching in. 
 Between that and their delusional sense of superiority. 
 How did you stomach it? 
 I don't know. You just, um... go on living, I guess. 
 If you call that living. 
 Mm. 
 Mary : So it turns out I was right about Marjory's nanny. 
 The girl was genetically a Semite. 
 Imagine someone like that having access to children. 
 With that and genetic defects, there should be compulsory screening. 
 Mary : Hmm. 
 Alice : Gerry used to say that. 
 Lucy : Was she reported? 
 Mary : Of course. 
 I couldn't live with myself if I hadn't said something. 
 Your play. 
 Hmm? 
 Your play, dear. 
 Are you all right? 
 Oh yes. Of course, I'm fine. 
 I suppose you must've seen a lot of that sort of thing. 
 The Japs are very lax with their racial laws, so I hear. 
 Well... 
 I don't blame you for staying single, Miss Mills. 
 Without any proper regulation for genetic hygiene, you could very well end up being married to anyone. 
 Mary : Don't be ridiculous, Lucy. You'd know. 
 How could you tell? 
 Because they have certain traits. 
 But how... 
 [Gasping] 
 Oh! I'm so sorry! 
 I don't know how that happened. 
 Let me get you a cloth, please. 
 I'll do it. 
 It's all right. 
 [Honking] 
 I wasn't sure you'd come. 
 It sounded urgent. 
 What's wrong? 
 Another fight with your father? 
 The way we met... that was no coincidence, was it? 
 My father sent you to persuade me to stay. 
 This is why you called me here? 
 I just want to know because I've had enough people lying to me. 
 Okay. 
 Yes, your father asked me to talk to you. 
 Is that how you afford your fancy car and your nice dresses? 
 Doing what powerful men ask you to? 
 Whatever issues you're having with your father, don't blame me. Go be angry with him. 
 You don't know anything about me. 
 Wait a second. Just wait. 
 You're right. 
 Please, can we just start over? 
 And be honest with one another? 
 Hello. 
 I'm Nicole. 
 All right. 
 I'm Joe. 
 Nice to meet you. 
 Now can you please get me the hell out of here? 
 Get in. 
 Josef! 
 Stop, please! 
 Josef! 
 Lucy : Is it coming out? 
 It doesn't matter. 
 It was a donation anyway. 
 I didn't have much when I moved here. 
 Now I feel even worse. 
 No, don't be silly. It's fine. 
 I must say your dress is very beautiful. 
 Thank you. 
 It is, isn't it? 
 I couldn't believe how well it fit. 
 Well, even I can see that, and I don't know anything about fashion. 
 John might have warned me you were such a stylish group of women. 
 How exactly do you know the family? 
 A mutual friend. 
 John and Helen have been so kind to me. 
 He's amazing. 
 And she just gives and gives. 
 Well, it's not coming out. 
 Why don't you let me replace it? 
 No, you don't have to do that. 
 But I want to. 
 Okay. 
 Nicole : I love the way the light falls on the leaves. 
 It reminds me that whatever I think is so important, the trees don't care. 
 Did your mother ever speak of the Fatherland? 
 My mother? Uh, heh. 
 No, she... she never talked about the past. 
 She said it unhealthy, that I should focus on the future. 
 You don't have to talk if you don't want to. 
 Yesterday I found out I'm a b*st*rd. 
 You proved that this morning. 
 My mother lied to me. 
 My father didn't run out on us. 
 She took me away from him. 
 I'm sorry, Joe. 
 I'm Lebensborn. 
 Does that spook you? 
 Why would it? 
 Welcome to the club. 
 Wait, wait, wait. Heh. 
 Wait. Y-You're... 
 We're not... 
 [Chuckle] 
 No. 
 Would I have kissed you like that? 
 Calm down. 
 Being Lebensborn isn't the worst thing in the world. 
 Really? Finding out you come from a breeding program? 
 We didn't have any choice in how we were born. 
 That housekeeper Silvia looks at me like I'm some sort of... 
 Chosen one? 
 Our parents' generation had some strange ideas. 
 Do I seem special to you? 
 [Chuckle] No, not at all. 
 You're completely boring. 
 The only thing special about me is that I refuse to let my father marry me off to some fossil. 
 I will decide what to do with my life and my future, thank you very much. 
 So... have you had enough? 
 Not even close. 
 I'm actually supposed to be somewhere, but why don't you come? 
 It might be just the thing you need. 
 What's that? 
 A different kind of space. 
 
 
 
 Raeder : Sir, we have a priority message from San Francisco Station. 
 Our agents believe they have located the most recent hideout of High Castle. 
 How recent? 
 It was a barn, torched within the last 24 hours. 
 And it appears that the fire destroyed a large cache of films. 
 Hundreds. 
 And that's very unfortunate. 
 Our agents are continuing to search the area. 
 Can you remind our Yakuza friends of the exact conditions of payment? 
 I want High Castle alive. 
 Yes, sir. 
 Erich. How are you? How's your mother? 
 We're both very well, Mrs... 
 Helen. Thank you. 
 Uh, it's a pleasure to see you here. 
 We had arranged to talk, but I don't think we set a time. 
 Now would be ideal for me, if it's convenient, of course. 
 I'll have the Standartenführers await further orders, sir. 
 No calls, please, Erich. 
 John... 
 This couldn't wait till I got home? 
 He's not going, John. 
 I will not allow it. 
 I stop breathing the moment Thomas walks out that front door, and I only start again when he is back home. 
 You want to let him go to South America? 
 Helen... 
 He will be found out, and you know what that means. 
 Okay. 
 Sit down. 
 Helen, sit down, please. 
 We are going to let him go. 
 Thomas will fly to Buenos Aires, all right? 
 And from there, he's going to travel to meet the others on his expedition. 
 But he's not going to make the rendezvous because, somewhere in the foothills of the Andes, he's going to be kidnapped by Semites. 
 You did this. 
 Now, this is going to look like, to the rest of the world, a terrorist act on a high-profile target, but Thomas, he's going to be okay. 
 He'll be safe. 
 In South America? 
 He could live for decades, Helen. 
 This way, he's going to be comfortable. 
 He's going to be safe. 
 No one's going to be able to reach him. 
 How can you be sure? 
 Because I will personally spearhead the search for him and for his kidnappers. 
 Now, you, of course, will be bereft, as will I, and publicly we'll never give up trying to bring our son home. 
 But ultimately, Helen... we will fail. 
 Now, if you have any questions, you have to ask me now... because, I'm afraid, once you've left this room, we must never talk about this again. 
 Will I ever see him again? 
 Maybe, one day. 
 When and if it is safe. 
 It's the only way, Helen. 
 [Chatter] 
 [Harmonica Playing] 
 Must bring back memories. 
 Sorry. Memories? 
 You're Nori's dad, right? 
 Yes. 
 I'm Jimmy. 
 Hello. 
 You must've been there... in Japan, I mean, you know... when they dropped the Big Ones? 
 Big Ones? 
 Hiroshima? Nagasaki? 
 I've seen photos. 
 Horrible, isn't it? 
 What we do to one another. 
 Human beings, I mean. 
 Yes. 
 Please excuse me. 
 Yeah, sure. 
 Woman : Yeah, we... 
 Juliana : I can take a break from... 
 [Chatter, Stapling] 
 Great. 
 We'll see. 
 Okay. 
 Hey, what do you think? 
 I love that. 
 Yeah. 
 Great. 
 Honey, how are you doing? 
 Oh, yeah, we're getting there. 
 I think these are dry. 
 Juliana : Okay. 
 That one, too. You can hang those up. 
 Getting there. Here, you, uh... 
 Does everyone have everything they need? 
 Hey, Joey, do you want to grab these? 
 [Chatter] 
 [Singing In Japanese] 
 What's going on? 
 Hey, honey, we're running low on poster board and some staples. 
 You want to maybe go down to the shop with your dad and pick some up? 
 Please? 
 You up for running an errand, Dad? 
 Hmm. 
 These are from Frankfurt. 
 A French designer, of course. 
 Say what you will about them, but they do know how to cut for the female form. 
 I love the palette this year. 
 It's so chic, don't you think? 
 Yeah, it's lovely. 
 Oh, this is the special collection. 
 Ordinarily, you wouldn't have access to these, but since you're with me... 
 [Chuckle] 
 I read that the Reich issues a standard clothing allowance to everyone. 
 Well, yes, but not everyone has to attend formal functions. 
 My husband Henry oversees the television networks here. 
 He reports directly to Reichsminister Goebbels. 
 I'm sorry. I should probably know what that means. 
 Henry helps... decide what people think... or at least what makes it onto the news. 
 To hear him describe it, it's the same thing. 
 Let's try her in the black. 
 It'll show off that darling waist. 
 And I'll try the vine and floral. 
 So how long have you and Henry been married? 
 Five happy years. 
 Oh, don't worry. 
 With your looks, you won't stay on the shelf for long. 
 Oh, no. 
 That's your plan, isn't it? 
 Cozy up to the Smiths, get them to marry you off to somebody important? 
 I'm joking. 
 Silly. [Giggle] 
 Let's try these on. 
 All right. 
 Wow, that looks so beautiful on you. 
 That... You... Fits you perfectly. 
 Come here. 
 Look, we could be sisters. 
 Don't worry. This is my treat. 
 Charge these to Mr. Collins. 
 Of course. 
 Thank you, Lucy. 
 Hmm. 
 [Rock N' Roll Playing On Radio] 
 [Chatter] 
 Who are these people? 
 The future of the Reich. 
 Wait, they're not all... 
 Lebensborn? Ja, some. 
 You'll know which after the sun goes down. 
 We glow in the dark. 
 [Chuckle] 
 Come on. I think it's time you experienced a real Berlin party. 
 [Jazz Playing] 
 Take it slow, Joe. 
 We can't be drunk and do the journey. 
 Nicki, schatzi! 
 Joe, meet Hans. Hans, meet Joe. 
 Nice to meet you. 
 Ah, yes. Heusmann's son. 
 You have been hiking with Nicole? 
 Mm-hmm. 
 Good. 
 Then you've done the physical part. 
 Excuse me? 
 The outside, the exterior, the bounty of nature that man cannot perfect because it is already perfect. 
 Monika, please don't scare away our guest. 
 Are you scared? 
 Because it's turning to the interior world that our personal realm is deeper, darker, chaotic. 
 I have no idea what you're talking about. 
 It's an environmentalist thing, Joe. 
 No concern of yours. 
 Of course it is. 
 The environment is all of our concern. 
 Your father's project, Atlantropa, it is being peddled as an economic miracle, but it is an abomination. 
 How could stemming the Mediterranean be good for the Reich? 
 I don't know, Hans. 
 I don't know anything about it. 
 Oh, it will have catastrophic effects on the earth. 
 Our planet will pay a heavy price. 
 And so will you two if we have to hear a political lecture. 
 Come on, let's pick out the perfect spot. 
 If they get down off their high horses, then they can join us. 
 Mm. 
 [Speaking French] 
 [Laughter, Chatter] 
 Have you had much experience with drugs? 
 What kind of drugs? 
 Lysergic acid. Have you done it? 
 You'd remember. 
 One of my father's biggest sellers. 
 He only supplies it to the military, but I have my ways. 
 Our parents' generation uses it for mind control... interrogating prisoners, for example. 
 But we use it... as mind expansion, as you'll see. 
 No pressuring. You can sit this out, Joe. 
 You seem like you're open to it, but if you're not ready yet to explore inner space... 
 It's deeper, darker, chaotic. 
 You said that already. 
 You can trust me, Joe. 
 I'll be here for you the whole time. 
 They behave as if were the end of the world. 
 It might be. 
 Fear is never to be trusted. 
 Dad, you know who puts their faith in things like Yarrow Stalks and the I Ching? 
 It's people who don't want to take responsibility for the choices that they've made. 
 You're wrong. 
 I take responsibility. 
 You need to let Mom move on with her life. 
 You need to sign the papers. 
 That is not your business. 
 Mom is too polite to say it herself. 
 She's too... 
 Japanese. 
 I was born there, but I'm an American now. 
 Yes. 
 You are. 
 So how long have you known John? 
 Not long at all. 
 Here you are. 
 Oh, thank you. 
 Dreadfully handsome, isn't he? 
 Don't worry. We all think so. 
 And Helen wouldn't be annoyed to hear it. 
 She knows what she's got. 
 Who did you say introduced you? 
 A friend of mine worked for him. 
 Joe Blake? 
 Oh. A friend or friend? 
 Well, now I'll just have to find you somewhere suitably glamorous to wear your pretty new dress. 
 Thanks again, Lucy. 
 What is it? 
 Lucy? You all right? 
 [Sigh] Everything's normal. 
 [Shudder] That's the problem. 
 Another month and no baby. 
 Apparently, these things take time. 
 We've been trying for three years. 
 You should see the way Henry looks at me now. 
 His disappointment. 
 Lucy, I'm so sorry. 
 [Sobbing] It's my fault. 
 It must be. 
 But I'm too afraid to take the test. 
 Henry's career would be over. 
 Something's wrong with me. 
 Something's... broken. 
 Uh... there are more important things, aren't there? 
 Not in the Reich. 
 Motherhood is everything. 
 You know, the Japanese have a philosophy called Kintsugi. 
 They take the pieces of something that's fallen apart, and they put it back together with gold. 
 Imperfection can be beautiful, Lucy. 
 You won't tell Helen... or the others. 
 Of course not. 
 I can trust you, right? 
 Of course. Come on. 
 [Distorted Sounds, Voices] 
 [Eerie Voice] 
 [Growling] 
 Nicole. Hans. 
 [Growling] 
 Juliana. 
 It really is you. 
 Everything's all right, Joe. 
 I'm sorry. 
 I'm sorry I killed them. I didn't mean to. 
 I know. 
 I killed you, too. 
 No. 
 It's okay. 
 I'm alive. 
 So are you. 
 Where did she... you... go? 
 I'm dead, too. 
 Nicole : Alive, dead, we're just specks of dust. 
 We blow away in the wind. 
 But it makes no difference. 
 We make no difference. 
 Dead or alive is all the same. 
 That is the beauty, Joe. 
 No. 
 You saved my life. 
 Please tell me it matters. 
 Of course it does, Joe. 
 It means you need to make it matter. 
 What the f... 
 [Sigh] 
 [Chatter] 
 Ohh. 
 [Knocking] 
 You rested. 
 That's good. 
 Mm. Yeah, I guess I did. 
 I think I should to go... 
 Is there a problem? 
 Just... Did Hans see us last night? 
 [Chuckle] 
 Don't worry about him. 
 Even if he did, he was busy with Monika. 
 Monika likes you. 
 You can have her, too. 
 I don't want Monika. 
 I'm ready to go see my father now. 
 Good. 
 [Speaking Japanese] 
 I felt sorry for her. 
 George : Remember she's a Nazi. 
 I know. I didn't expect to. 
 What about you? You ever want to have kids? 
 Why do you ask? 
 Uh, your mom told me you were like a mother to Trudy, the way you looked after her. 
 Ma wasn't always around, so a lot of the time it was just the two of us. 
 You know, Trudy had the best imagination. 
 As long as I could turn it into a story or a game, she wasn't afraid of anything. 
 I used to tell her that if we waved at the Japanese bombers that they would just keep flying and they'd leave us alone. 
 And no bombs would fall on us as long as we sang. 
 We used to skip to the shelter singing "Follow the Yellow Brick Road." 
 You remind me of her. 
 Was it you who got her involved in the Resistance? 
 It was her boyfriend, but I introduced her to Randall, so... it's my fault. 
 I don't know. 
 Once Trudy made her mind up about something, there was no talking her out of it. 
 You shouldn't blame yourself. 
 Thank you for saying that. 
 When she found you, Did she say anything about a way out? 
 What? 
 It was just something she said one of the last times we spoke. 
 She said she'd found the answer to everything and... she'd found the way out. 
 You think she knew she was going to die? 
 That's not what she meant. 
 You sure? 
 How was school? 
 Okay. Thanks. 
 You're too old to sulk, Thomas. 
 Sorry, Father. It's just, uh... 
 I just wanted to tell everyone that I got picked for the expedition. 
 You wanted to brag. 
 No. 
 Okay, maybe... maybe a little. 
 And especially to that big-mouth Barker. 
 But I didn't. 
 I thought it through and didn't say anything, since I don't know if I'm going or not. 
 That's very wise. 
 So, uh... you said we'd talk about it tonight. 
 No. I said we'd talk about it later. 
 Well, when's that? 
 Well, it's unspecified. 
 That's the beauty of it, you see... 
 [Door Opens] 
 Speaking of beauty. 
 [Chuckle] 
 Well, at least they'll learn how to set a table properly, if nothing else... in South America. 
 You mean... 
 Y-You mean you're letting me go? 
 We're letting you go. 
 Ohh! 
 You guys are the best. 
 Ahh. 
 Tonight I call upon Chairman Khrushchev to halt and eliminate this clandestine, reckless, and provocative threat to world peace and to stable relations between our two nations. 
 I call upon him further to abandon this course of world domination and to join in an historic effort to end the perilous arms race and to transform the history of man. 
 He has an opportunity now to move the world back from the abyss of destruction by withdrawing these weapons from Cuba, by refraining from any action which will widen or deepen the present crisis, and then by participating in a search for peaceful and permanent solutions. 
 My fellow citizens, let no one doubt that this is a difficult and dangerous epoch on which we have set out. 
 No one can foresee precisely what course it will take or what costs or casualties will be incurred. 
 Many months in which both our patience and our will will be tested, months in which many threats and denunciations will keep us aware of our dangers. 
 But the greatest danger of all would be to do nothing. 
 Our goal is not the victory of might but the vindication of right, not peace at the expense of freedom but both peace and freedom, here in this hemisphere and we hope around the world. 
 God willing, that goal will be achieved.
