 John : I'll get it. 
 Dr. Adler? 
 Can I have a word? 
 Of course. 
 I, uh... 
 I didn't know you made house calls, doctor. 
 You know why I'm here, John. 
 Gerry, my boy, he's... he... he hasn't shown any symptom... 
 I mean, not one... in the past five days. 
 I told you he is not going to get any better. 
 But he's not getting worse. 
 Is he, doc? 
 I mean, not yet. 
 Please... just give me more time. 
 You don't need me to tell you. 
 Withholding his diagnosis is a crime against the state. 
 Look, I sat on this n-not just because of who you are but because Helen and Alice are friends. 
 I... I appreciate that. 
 I understand. It's hard. 
 The hardest thing a father could ever do. 
 My heart aches for you. It really does. 
 But... the boy is defective. 
 And there are reporting requirements. 
 If I don't submit records to the Health Office, questions will be raised. 
 I'm... I'm sorry, John. 
 But if you don't take care of this today... 
 I'll have to do it tomorrow. 
 [Chatter] 
 Herr Blake. 
 Sieg heil. 
 Does he, now? 
 Josef. 
 Sieg heil. 
 Hmm. 
 I'd like to show you something. 
 You've heard of Advantropa, ja? 
 No. 
 When completed, it will dam the Mediterranean Sea between Gibraltar and Morocco. 
 Billions of kilowatts of electricity will be generated. 
 Its waters will be desalinated and used to irrigate the Sahara Desert, creating millions of hectares of farmland to feed a hungry continent. 
 It's exciting, isn't it, what we can accomplish here in the Reich? 
 I suppose. 
 You look a great deal like your mother. 
 You remember what she looks like? 
 I understand how difficult this must be for you, Josef. 
 And I appreciate your coming. 
 I was ordered to come, sir. 
 No one's told me why. 
 Obergruppenführer Smith made me aware of your service to the Reich, and I was favorably impressed. 
 I don't report to Obergruppenführer Smith anymore. 
 I see. 
 You're your own man now, ja? 
 I've always been my own man. 
 Had to be growing up, you know. 
 It was just me and my mother. 
 You have every right to be angry with me, Josef, based on your understanding. 
 My understanding? 
 [Knock Knock] 
 [Speaking German] 
 I had hoped to spend the entire morning together, but something has come up. 
 But there is a small gathering at my home this evening. 
 Could we continue this conversation then? 
 Do I have a choice? 
 Heil Hitler. 
 Heil Hitler. 
 Ed : The Yakuza? 
 You shouldn't have done that, Frank. 
 If I hadn't, you'd be dead right now. 
 There are worse things. 
 Yeah. Maybe you're right. 
 There's, uh... 
 There's something else. 
 What? 
 I got this from Jules. 
 From Mexico? 
 She didn't say where she went. 
 I'm pretty sure it wasn't Mexico. 
 So where is she? 
 The last thing I knew, she was with him... the Nazi. 
 No. That doesn't make sense. 
 She wouldn't do that. 
 There's got to be another explanation. 
 You know what? It doesn't matter. 
 None of it does. 
 Why don't we go back to your place and get some... 
 I'm not going back there. I can't ever go back. 
 Frank... 
 It stinks, Ed. 
 This whole damn city just stinks. 
 It's lousy with pollens. 
 What are we going to do about the Yakuza? 
 We just bide time. We'll figure it out. 
 ♪ My, oh, my ♪ 
♪ I see you and I love you ♪ 
 [Knock On Door] 
 If you're going to sell my life to the Yakuza, the least you could do is bother to show up. 
 [Scoff] 
 No. Wait. Please. 
 It's just... 
 You understand? 
 Our first payment is due in seven days. 
 Seven days. 
 All right, let's start with the high value artifacts. 
 I like the way you think. 
 I've already selected a few likely candidates for reproduction. 
 A buyer in Yokohama wrote specifically for this piece. 
 It's Custer's Tiffany sword, given to him when he was made general. 
 No. Too detailed. 
 It would take me at least a month. 
 All right. Uh... a quaint artifact from Negro history: The trumpet Louis Armstrong used when he recorded "Lazy River" in 1931. 
 Sure, if you can get me a hydraulic system to bend the main tube. 
 What about this? 
 The cufflink Abraham Lincoln wore the night he was assassinated. 
 How much could you hock it for? 
 I'm a reputable salesman, Mr. Frink. 
 I do not hock. 
 How much? 
 To the right buyer, 25-30,000. 
 All right, so I make two. 
 Mm. No, no. 
 Just locating one would be the prize of a lifetime. 
 To find the pair, it would raise too much suspicion. 
 Old Abe had two sleeves, didn't he? It's a set. 
 And we need that money fast. 
 You live here, right? 
 Why? Wait a minute. 
 Where are you going? Excuse me. 
 [Hawaiian Guitar On Phonograph] 
 Uh, w... This is my home, Mr. Frink, and strictly off limits. 
 How's the ventilation? 
 I beg your pardon? 
 [Door Bell Rings] 
 Ed : Hello. 
 Yeah. Back here, Ed. 
 Ed? Who the hell is Ed? 
 My assistant. 
 Your assistant? The assistant? 
 The one who got us into this mess? 
 Here's the stuff you wanted. 
 Thanks. Ed, this is Childan. 
 Oh, hey. Pleasure to meet you. 
 It's Mr. Childan. 
 And get that off my Hepplewhite right this instant. 
 What? The table? 
 I don't know what you think you're doing here, Mr. Frink, but this is completely unacceptable. 
 My place isn't safe, and we have a week to make two of these. 
 This isn't... You can't possibly... 
 Either we work here, or you explain to the Yakuza why we're going to be late with our first payment. 
 All right, figure out the materials we'll need while I'm gone. 
 All right. 
 Hey, where are you going? 
 We need more tools. 
 Lem : Keep moving. They'll see you. 
 What the hell happened? 
 The shop was burned. 
 I'm making sure our people don't walk into a trap. 
 I meant with Juliana. 
 Your people were supposed to get her to Mexico. 
 I'm not at lib... 
 You're not going. 
 I need answers. 
 Get your f*cking hands off me. 
 You want to kill me? Go ahead. 
 You'd be doing me a favor. 
 Come with me. 
 This is Frank Frink. 
 He wants to know what happened to Juliana. 
 Who is this? 
 My name's Gary. 
 Gary Connell. 
 Wait. I want to talk to Karen. 
 Karen's dead. 
 Your girlfriend got her killed. 
 What are you talking about? 
 She betrayed all of us, Frank... you, Lem, Karen, me. 
 She let Joe Blake go with the film. 
 No. No, no, no. I don't... I don't believe you. 
 No? 
 This is her... defecting to the Reich yesterday. 
 Lem : She's in New York right now. 
 You know what? This is your fault. 
 Our fault. 
 If it hadn't been for you people. 
 And those goddamn films, none of this would have happened. 
 You're right, brother. I'm sorry. 
 You know what? No. I am not your brother. 
 Yes, you are, Frank. 
 We are all on the same side here. 
 Oh, yeah? Yeah, what side is that? 
 The side that stands against the Japanese. 
 The side that stands against the Nazis, that stands for freedom. 
 Freedom, whatever that is. 
 We heard what happened to your sister and her kids. 
 This is what you do, isn't it? 
 You use people's suffering to turn them to your lost cause. 
 Well, I am not signing up for any causes. 
 You just look out for yourself, is that it, Frank? 
 Yeah. Yeah, that's pretty much it. 
 What do you think? 
 See where he goes. 
 Was this the man you saw? 
 I think so. 
 His name is George Dixon. 
 What does he have to do with Trudy? 
 He's her father. 
 Man : Miss? 
 Excuse me, Miss, where are you from? 
 Hmm? 
 None of my business. 
 I know. I guess I'm just a little nervous. 
 I am Hector. 
 Juliana. 
 W-We're from Buenos Aires. 
 What's it like there? 
 It's not safe, not anymore. 
 War is coming, you know? 
 [Chatter] 
 Are you full Aryan? 
 Full Aryan? 
 My... My wife's grandmother is Aymara, but her father is Aryan. 
 We have the birth certificate to prove it. 
 That's what counts, isn't it? 
 Woman : Miss Crain? 
 Here. 
 Good luck. 
 Genealogy records? 
 I don't... I don't have any genealogy records. 
 You don't have any. 
 No. I'm from the Pacific States. 
 They don't keep records like that there. 
 I'm going to need you to get undressed. 
 Uh, I think there's been a mistake. 
 I applied for political asylum. 
 Put this on. 
 I'll be back with a doctor in a moment. 
 Head height: 200 millimeters. 
 Mandible width: 150 millimeters. 
 High skull with oval facial form. 
 Olive complexion with slight tones of yellow. 
 Right to left at... 
 Blue eyes, strong. 
 Long hair. 
 Brown, slight tones of yellow. 
 Under 30. 
 Is your blood Aryan? 
 I'm not sure. 
 Maybe. 
 Initial assessment Group 2. 
 Assessment Group 3. 
 Satisfactory. 
 Mediterranean trade facial features. 
 Full face. 
 What are all these? 
 I escaped the Resistance. 
 They didn't tell you that? 
 But these are older scars. 
 What caused them? 
 I was hit by a bus a couple of years ago. 
 Hold still. 
 Miss Crain, I'm Sturmbannführer Raeder. 
 Going to ask you a few questions, all right? 
 All right. 
 We are aware of the assistance you gave Joe Blake. 
 May I please speak with him? 
 We are also aware of your Resistance activities in Cannon City and San Francisco. 
 I'm not in the Resistance. 
 You're not? 
 No. I was just trying to find out why they got my sister killed. 
 How many times were you sexually involved with Joe Blake? 
 I'm sorry? 
 Be specific. 
 I wasn't sexually involved with him at all. 
 That's not the information we have. 
 Then the information you have is incorrect. 
 What, then, was your motive for assisting him? 
 I didn't assist him. I saved his life. 
 And I gave him that film you wanted. 
 You must already know that. 
 You will provide a full accounting of your activities for the past two weeks since the moment your sister died. 
 Every place you went, every person you met, everything you saw. 
 Everything. 
 Do you understand? 
 Ahem. 
 [Knock On Door] 
 Mr. Walker. 
 May I have a word? 
 Arnold? Is someone here? 
 I am Chief Inspector Kido, Mrs. Walker, of the Kempeitai. 
 Have I intruded, Mrs. Walker? 
 No. 
 Not... Not at all. 
 We were just sitting down to have lunch. 
 Uh, would you care to join us? 
 There was a report of an incident in front of your building yesterday. 
 Gunshots. 
 Oh, is that what that was? 
 I thought that was a truck backfiring. 
 No. As I said, shots were fired. 
 Was your daughter here yesterday? 
 That depends on which daughter you mean. 
 I have two daughters. 
 Yes, my husband's right. 
 We have... I mean, he has two daughters. 
 Well, we has... 
 I am well aware. 
 I refer to your eldest daughter Juliana Crain. 
 Was she here? 
 Juliana? Yes. 
 She was here, sir. 
 So you offered her assistance... before she fled to the Reich. 
 What? 
 Why would she do that? 
 It is what I am here to ascertain. 
 Chief Inspector... 
 Ever since Trudy disappeared, Juliana just hasn't been herself. 
 It really shook her up. 
 They're very close. 
 I mean, when she came here, out of the blue she was, uh, strange, upset, talking crazy. 
 Crazy? 
 What do you mean exactly? 
 Uh, well... 
 I think... it was because of some films that she saw. 
 From the, uh... 
 From whom? 
 From the Man In the High Castle. 
 Whatever he showed her... upset her very much. 
 She said it was a film of this city... destroyed after an atomic bomb. 
 She met him? 
 The Man In the High Castle? 
 Yes. 
 She's not on their side. 
 You understand that they were after her. 
 Do you see what I'm saying? 
 Arnold. 
 When your daughter calls home, you will notify me. 
 If you do not, I will know. 
 You failed to account for your whereabouts the day you escaped from the Resistance. 
 They kept me in the trunk of a car. 
 The trunk of a car? 
 The entire day? 
 Yes. Look, I'm... I'm sorry. I haven't... I haven't slept all night. I'm really very tired. 
 Are there many more questions you need to ask? 
 
 
 
 Sieg heil. 
 So these, uh... these members of the Resistance you've named, Miss Crain... your sister and her boyfriend... they're both dead. 
 Joe Blake's already identified Lemuel Washington for us. 
 I also named a woman... Karen. 
 Karen Vecchione. Yes. 
 Shot dead the day before yesterday by the Japanese. 
 So is there anyone living whose name you can give us? 
 If there was anyone else I could identify, I would. 
 What about the man who shot at you when you escaped from that car? 
 Surely you can always describe him. 
 It was Lemuel Washington who shot at me. 
 There was no other man, not that I'm aware of. 
 Oh, that is... disappointing. 
 We have received a request from the Japanese authorities for the immediate return of Miss Crain, sir. 
 I know you don't owe me anything. 
 I just thought that, after what I did for Joe, that I might be safe here. 
 Have you finished your evaluation, Sturmbannführer? 
 Yes, sir, but there is a medical issue. 
 Fractured pelvis. 
 Two years ago, I was in a bus accident. 
 Have you tried to conceive children since then? 
 No, sir. 
 For a woman your age seeking asylum, the ability to bear children is a factor. 
 You're wrong, Miss Crain. 
 We do owe you. 
 We're not going to send you back to face the Kempeitai or the Resistance. 
 A temporary asylum is approved. 
 On my authority. 
 Thank you. 
 I am Obergruppenführer John Smith. 
 Welcome to the Reich. 
 I'll take those. 
 Sir, we don't really believe that the Reich owes Miss Crain. 
 You mean because she scored so poorly in so many of the categories? 
 She lied about her relationship with Joe Blake. 
 They're closer than she admits. 
 I'm counting on it, Erich. 
 Shouldn't I prepare a full transcript? 
 No, that won't be necessary. 
 I'll take care of Miss Crain's case myself. 
 Thank you, Erich. That will be all. 
 The Reich isn't what I pictured. 
 No? 
 Everything's so clean. 
 Well... we all work together to pursue the common goal: A way of life we cherish. 
 Do you think I might be able to see Joe? 
 He's away right now, but... of course, when the time's right. 
 My family and I, we're, uh, very fond of Joe, you know? 
 Which is... one reason we want to take special care of you. 
 I don't want you to go to any trouble. 
 No, I insist. 
 First we got to make sure you're safe, Safe? 
 From the Resistance. 
 They're pretty weak here in the Reich, but they're not altogether eradicated unless I know where to find them. 
 They might come looking for revenge. 
 Which is why, from now on, your name will be Julia Mills from Seattle. 
 You'll be given new identity papers, a personal history to memorize. 
 Okay. 
 Don't worry. 
 You'll be given accommodation, and an allowance until your application for permanent citizenship's granted. 
 Okay. 
 I wish there were some way I could repay your kindness. 
 [Chuckling] Well... there is one way. 
 The Man In the High Castle. 
 And it is of the utmost importance that we find him. 
 If there was... anything, any detail, anything you could tell us. 
 But it's... 
 I know you can't because you'd have told us already. 
 Julia Mills, meet my better half Mrs. Helen Smith. 
 Pleasure to meet you. 
 Oh, you poor thing. 
 John didn't give me all of the details, just enough to know that your head must be spinning. 
 Good day, Miss Mills. 
 We'll speak again soon. 
 Thank you. 
 Come on with me. 
 Let me show you your new home. 
 It's cute, isn't it? 
 You're lucky to get one of the singles. 
 Most of the other girls have to share an apartment. 
 Other girls? 
 This is a dormitory for single women. 
 Would you like tea? I made some. 
 Yes. Thanks. That's very kind. 
 Okay. 
 How many other girls live here? 
 Uh, there's space for 20 or 30, but I'm not sure how many are here now. 
 Oh. We've thrown some things into the closet for you. 
 There wasn't much time, so I hope they fit. 
 And you'll find some make-up in the bathroom. 
 Wow. 
 This is so much more than I could have hoped for. 
 Well, it's hard work to... 
 Once you get settled, you'll be expected to join some of the neighborhood committees and the Nazi Women's League. 
 But first you have to pass the ACT. 
 What is the ACT? 
 The Auxiliary Citizenship Test. 
 That gives you the right to stay in the Reich permanently. 
 You must be exhausted after everything you've been through. 
 I am a little. 
 Why don't you come by the house tomorrow? 
 Say, 10:00. 
 We can have coffee and get to know each other. 
 All right. 
 Okay. 
 We're at 5026 Roxboro. 
 I have left a tuna casserole in the fridge for you. 
 But there's a grocer over on von Braun Street if you need anything else. 
 You'll find 50 marks and some change in the desk drawer there. 
 You thought of everything. 
 I don't know what to say. 
 Well, that's just it. 
 You don't have to say anything. 
 See, now you're some place where good people actually look out for one another. 
 I'll see you tomorrow. 
 Okay. 
 Okay. 
 Thanks. 
 Wait. What about the key? 
 Oh, there isn't one. 
 No one locks their doors around here. 
 This is the third ship we've lost to pirates in as many months. 
 I offer the Empire's sympathies, Mr. Brewer, but why bring this matter to me? 
 Because the shipping lanes off Sri Lanka are under Japanese control. 
 It is the duty of your Imperial Navy to secure them. 
 Or to compensate us if they cannot. 
 The oceans are vast, Mr. Cullen. 
 Piracy plagues us all, even the Reich. 
 [Speaking Japanese] 
 Forgive me, Trade Minister. 
 General Onoda... 
 Excuses, please. 
 Trade Minister will attend to you in a few moments. 
 This way, gentlemen, please. 
 [Speaking Japanese] 
 You altered my plan. 
 As Trade Minister, I'm familiar with trucking companies and their routes. 
 I believe that the use of private trucks will lessen the risk of unforeseen dangers. 
 Risk? Dangers? 
 To what do you refer? 
 Transporting enriched uranium on public buses would expose women and children to lethal levels of radiation. 
 American women and children, not Japanese. 
 It may not be necessary. Consider the alterna... 
 I know you're well regarded by the Crown Prince and Princess, Tagomi-tai'i. 
 This is not your area of proficiency. 
 Please forgive my misunderstanding. 
 I thought it my duties to offer my... 
 You are not to question my orders again. 
 Is that clear? 
 Thank you. 
 [Piano] 
 [Chatter] 
 Ah, Josef. 
 Welcome. 
 Any trouble getting here? 
 We're sort of smug, aren't we? 
 Well, by Berlin standards. 
 This is to celebrate the completion of the konfidenz at Puntalitalifar. 
 You wanted me to see all this. 
 Is that so wrong? Hmm? 
 For a father to show his son what he's achieved? 
 [Chuckle] 
 Let me introduce you to some very good friends of mine, very dear to me. 
 Thomas. 
 What do you say, uh, you and me just take the car and go out to the lake like we used to? 
 I can't. There's a Hitler Youth meeting this afternoon. 
 So you'll miss it. 
 Miss it? 
 Are you okay, Father? 
 When I was your age... 
 Grandpa, sometimes he'd just... he'd just keep me out of school right down the pond near our house, and we'd just fish, you know? 
 Me and him, till sundown. 
 Those are some of the favorite memories I've got of my father. 
 They had cars back then? 
 Watch it, Mister. 
 What do we tell Mom? 
 It'll be our secret. 
 ["Moonlight Sonata" Plays] 
 Mr. Blake. 
 Yes? 
 Oberführer Ernst Schmidt. 
 Adwehr. It's an honor. 
 Adwehr. That's intelligence, right? 
 Indeed. 
 I shouldn't mention it, but I read the classified briefing on your mission in San Francisco. 
 I just had to say well done. 
 Thank you. 
 I particularly enjoyed your negotiation with those Negro criminals on the boat. Ha ha! It's masterful, just masterful. 
 That wasn't a negotiation. 
 That was an assassination. 
 Uh, yeah. 
 How long will you be in Berlin? 
 Uh, I'm hoping we'll see more of you. 
 Excuse me. Ahem. 
 Josef? 
 Is something wrong? 
 I'm going home. 
 What happened? 
 One of your guests reminded me of who I am and who I'm not. 
 I don't understand. 
 You wouldn't. 
 But I've seen the blood that pays for this champagne. 
 And if you think for a second that it's going to make me forget what you did to my mother... 
 She died poor, by the way. 
 Josef, I'm not asking you to forget anything. 
 I get it. It was war. You were here. 
 We were there. 
 There's more to the story, son. 
 I don't care anymore. 
 Please. Please stay. 
 Is that an order, Reichsminister? 
 Whatever it is you need to tell me to clear your conscience, I don't want to hear it. 
 May I have a light? 
 All these important men congratulating themselves on how important they are. 
 I hate these parties, too. 
 Nicole Dahmer. 
 Joe Blake. 
 Blake? I thought the Reichsminister called you "son." 
 Yeah, well, I only met him today. 
 I suppose he hoped to impress you with all of this. 
 I'm not from here. I don't give a sh1t. 
 You realize your father is one of the most powerful men in the Reich. 
 He could get you anything you want. 
 Anything he wants to give me, I don't want it. 
 So you're the only man in Berlin without an agenda. 
 I guess so. 
 [Man Speaking German] 
 Do you know what? 
 I believe you. 
 Here you go. 
 Thank you. 
 So where are you headed? 
 Back to New York. 
 And what will you do there? 
 I don't know yet, but I want it to be real, to be honest. 
 And that's not possible in Germany? 
 How long have you been here? 
 Long enough. 
 Berlin is much more than ridiculous parties and pompous ministers. 
 It's the engine that drives the work. 
 Maybe you're right. 
 Maybe it's not as honest as New York. 
 Or maybe we just need more honest men. 
 I'm sorry to see you go, Joe Blake. 
 Ed : So we're going to need copper, metal alloy, and what else? 
 And yellow gold. 
 Where are we going to get that with no money? 
 I have an idea. 
 Mr. Frink, you do not have my authorization to give out this address. 
 I haven't. 
 Is that so? 
 Well, a man dropped this off for you, and he looked... unsavory. 
 Who is it? 
 Don't worry about it. 
 Oh. No. Strange man showing up as we're engaged in criminal acts. 
 Why would I worry? 
 Excuse me. Is this seat taken? 
 Oh. 
 Uh, actually, I was waiting for someone. 
 For Sarah, right? 
 You have something for me? 
 I think there's been a mistake. 
 I agree. 
 We shouldn't be trusting our lives to the ex-boyfriend of a traitor. 
 But here we are. 
 I don't know what they told you, but you people came to me. 
 Do you know how to drive, Frank? 
 Yeah. Yeah. Why? 
 Because kempeitai are about to round up a dozen innocent people. 
 What's that got to do with me? 
 It's reprisal for the death of two Pon cops shot when your girlfriend ran away. 
 [Sigh] 
 Well, that's not my fault or my problem. 
 12 people are about to die. 
 If you can live with that, enjoy your ramen. 
 But if you can't... there's a taxi parked up the block. 
 Pick me up outside in five minutes. 
 [Line Ringing] 
 Information. How may I help you? 
 Hi, Yes, Uh, I'm looking for a Joe or a Joseph Blake in Brooklyn. 
 I have a Joseph Blake in Flatbush. 
 Great. That might be him. 
 Would you have a street address? 
 [Buzz] 
 Woman : Can I help you? 
 Uh, yes. I was just... 
 Looking for Joe? 
 [Chuckle] Yeah. How did you know? 
 You're very pretty. 
 Well, thank you. 
 I'm... I'm Julia Mills, a friend of Joe's. 
 Of course you are. 
 I'm Rita Pierce, also a friend of Joe's. 
 Joe's in Berlin. 
 Berlin? 
 Yeah, his daddy's some big cheese over there, top of the Nazi heap, close to it. 
 I guess, uh, Joe smelled a career opportunity. 
 Can you blame him? 
 Um... just... Thank you. I'll just get out of your hair. 
 He fooled you, too. 
 I'm sorry. 
 Everyone, please stay at your stations and cooperate. 
 May I ask, sir, what is this about? And you go, too. 
 [Shouting In Japanese] 
 Where's Gary and Lem? 
 Stay in the car and keep the engine running. 
 When she shooting stops, we need to get out of here fast. 
 Shooting? 
 [Door Opens, Closes] 
 [Engine Starts] 
 Please. 
 Gary : Let them go! 
 Put the knife down! 
 Everybody stay put. 
 We're going to get you out of here. 
 Where are the keys at? 
 Keys. We need keys. 
 [Gun Cocks] 
 Shoot him. 
 Let her go! 
 [Speaking Japanese] 
 [Clicking]

 [Muffled Shouts]
