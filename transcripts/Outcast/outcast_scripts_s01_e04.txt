 Anderson : The afflictions of this world became too much for Norville Grant to bear, so he chose to leave them behind, sooner than the Lord intended. 
 (COUGHING) But he rests easy now, reunited with his beloved Elise, and he is remembered by those who... who he leaves behind. 
 Would you like to say anything? 
 Uh... 
 Caleb. 
 (CLEARS THROAT) 
 (GRUNTS) 
 Uh, let me get my tools. 
 (MUTTERS) sh1t. 
 Sorry I'm late. 
 I didn't realize anyone else was coming. 
 Are you family? 
 No. 
 Just a friend. 
 I knew he was struggling with the loss of Elise, but... had no idea how hopeless he must have felt. 
 My condolences. Reverend Anderson. 
 Sidney. 
 Sidney. 
 Were you and Norville close? 
 Uh, not really. No, sir. 
 I lived next door. 
 You're the young man who found him. 
 Yeah. Kyle Barnes. 
 Sidney : Norville spoke about you. 
 Oh, he did? 
 Fondly. 
 I'm gonna be in town for a while to put Norville's affairs in order. 
 I hope I see you around. 
 Yeah. Sure. 
 Goodbye, old friend. 
 Reverend.

 Now where'd this little fella come from? 
 (SCREAMING) 
 Are you all right? 
 This one... 
 Yeah. Yeah, that was hard-won. 
 I imagine they all were. 
 It's my ex-wife Janet. She thought it was sad. 
 Like an old... high school quarterback reliving the glory days. 
 I don't imagine she'd think much of my collection. 
 I don't really care what she thinks. 
 Goddammit. 
 You all right? 
 Yeah. Zip me up? 
 Mmm. 
 You nervous? 
 It's date night. We're not going to the White House. 
 Oh, come on. Date Night's a lot of pressure. 
 I know I'm feeling it. 
 I ran out of things to say a long time ago. 
 Took me a long time to come up with a good topic for tonight. 
 I'll be the judge of that. 
 Mm-hmm. 
 Better just bring your A-game. 
 (CHUCKLES) 
 All I have is A-game.

 (LOUD CHATTERING) 
 Doug Myer's brother-in-law, he's got a house down in Myrtle Beach. 
 I mean, it's not on the beach, but it's, you know, about 10 minutes away, and it's half as much as being at the water. 
 You all right? 
 I'm just gonna give Pam a quick call. 
 Oh, she's fine. 
 I'll just be a minute. 
 Hello, Megan. 
 I thought that was you. (CHUCKLES) 
 I'm sorry, uh, do I know you? 
 I'm Mark Holter. 
 Right. 
 Where's your horse? 
 Excuse me? 
 Oh, just, Megan used to always say that a knight on a big white stallion was gonna come and carry her away some day. 
 You remember that, Megan? 
 You used to act it out with your Barbies and this little plastic horse with the broken tail. 
 I guess a cop was the next best thing. 
 Mark : I'm sorry. Who are you? 
 Oh, sorry. Donnie Hamel. 
 Megan and I go way back. 
 Uh-huh. 
 How'd you know that I was a police officer? 
 Ah, Facebook. 
 Oh. Yeah. 
 Yeah. 
 It's scary to think about how our sh1t's out there for everyone to see, huh? 
 Yeah. 
 Oh, cute kid, by the way. 
 Thank you. 
 So you... Do you live around here? 
 No, Officer, not for... not for years now. 
 I'm just back in town on business. 
 I'm the regional rep for Tire Outpost. 
 So, let me know when you need some new rubber, and I will hook you up. 
 All right. Will do. 
 All right. 
 And you and I should get some coffee at some point. 
 I'm out at the Baymont by the interstate. 
 I'm sure you know the place. 
 Now... 
 Anyway, I don't want to interrupt your dinner any longer. 
 You look great. And it was a pleasure to meet you, sir. 
 Yeah. Same here. 
 Okay. Enjoy your meal. 
 Should I be jealous? 
 That's not funny. 
 (LAUGHS) 
 There something wrong with that guy? 
 Yeah, actually. 
 He's an asshole. 
 A dumb jock and a bully, and I thought I'd never have to see him again. 
 Hmm. 
 So... 
 You want me to kick his ass? 
 No. But don't you dare buy any tires from him. 
 (LAUGHS) 
 Giles : How do you want 'em? 
 Mrs. Ogden : Oh, I'll have mine still mooing. 
 You're eating meat? I got you garden burgers. 
 I just sort of started having a taste for it. 
 She keeps surprising me. 
 Secret to a successful marriage. 
 After 32 years, I don't think we have any surprises left. 
 Oh, is that a challenge? 
 Mmm, no, ma'am. I know better than to throw down with you.

 Come on, now, Buzzy. 
 Buzzy, come on, good boy.

 Giles : Good boy, good boy, good boy. 
 Good boy.

 Lord have mercy, I don't know what got into him. 
 Oh, he's just letting us all know who's boss. 
 Anybody need anything from inside? 
 Hit me. 
 You better slow down, big boy. 
 Never. 
 I'll go help Rose with the drinks. 
 I am sorry about that. 
 They do say they're excellent judges of character. 
 Well, he sniffed you out. 
 (CHUCKLES) 
 Almost forgot. 
 I'll be damned. 
 That's yours, isn't it? 
 It sure is. I... never thought I'd see it again. 
 How'd you lose it? 
 Oh, I don't rightly know. 
 Kat is always telling me not to wear it to work. 
 Could have been anywhere. 
 Where'd you find it? 
 Someone turned it in down at the station. 
 It's good to know we still got us some honest folks out there.

 Hello? 
 Kyle (over phone) : Where are you? I've been calling you all morning. 
 Sorry. I didn't recognize the number. 
 Kyle : I got a new phone. Where are you? 
 I'm at the thrift store. What's wrong? 
 I ran into Donnie last night. 
 He said he saw you. Did something happen? 
 Megan? 
 Nothing happened. 
 I was at dinner and he, um... 
 Nothing happened. 
 Kyle : What are we gonna do? 
 We're not doing anything. 
 Kyle : Look, I can't just ignore this. 
 Yes, you can. 
 Megan... 
 Aren't you in enough trouble as it is? 
 The last thing you need to do is get mixed up with him. 
 Megan : You didn't, did you? Kyle? 
 I can't do nothing, you know that. 
 You've done enough. 
 Promise me, Kyle. 
 All right. 
 Megan : Thanks for checking in, shithead, but I'm fine. 
 But, Megan... 
 I gotta go. 
 Hey. 
 I went by the church. 
 Florence said you was out here. 
 That woman cannot keep a secret. 
 You been out here all day? 
 I have a confession to make. 
 One of the things that sucks about this job is that everybody wants something from you. 
 Every misery they suffer, every dying grandma, every cheating husband, all gets dumped on me. 
 Sometimes I just need a break. 
 Don't we all. 
 Come on. Give me a hand. 
 You tracked me down, so what can I do for you? 
 Well, how's it you get your... 
 I don't know what you call 'em, cases, victims? 
 Is it like, you got a bat phone in the church or something? 
 (CHUCKLES) 
 Itching for some action, right? 
 Well... 
 People close to me get hurt, and it's been going on a long time, and I think it might still be going on. 
 I don't feel like sitting on my ass anymore. 
 You weren't sitting on your ass last night. 
 I heard you got knocked on it. 
 That's old business. It's got nothing to do with this. 
 The hell it doesn't. 
 You got a gift, son, and I wanna help you use it. 
 But you also got a reputation. 
 People gotta be willing to let you in the door. 
 You wanna fight the devil, start by cleaning your f*cking act up. 
 You talk to God with that mouth? 
 Oh, he's heard a lot worse than that. 
 Have any plans for the rest of the day? 
 Come on. Let's go for a little drive. 
 Forgetting something? 
 Oh, thanks, hon. 
 Forgetting something else? 
 Damn. 
 I'll see you in a couple days. 
 You put that on. 
 Yes, ma'am. 
 I don't want one them dumb crackers mistaking you for a deer. 
 Those dumb crackers are our good friends and neighbors. 
 The exorcism is a last resort. 
 My goal is to not have to perform another one. 
 And this fruit cocktail is your secret weapon? 
 More like a vaccine. 
 Our job is to... is to help people resist the dark forces. 
 Deny the devil a foot in that door. 
 Uh-huh. 
 You got a problem with that? 
 
 
 
 (DOORBELL RINGS) 
 I just don't see how that fits in to what happened with my mom. 
 Or my wife, or Joshua Austin. 
 I mean, what did they ever do to let the devil in? 
 Woman : Hello, Reverend. 
 Sophie, I didn't know you were in town. 
 Just for the weekend, to see Mama. 
 Come in. 
 This is Kyle. He's helping me with the shut-ins today. 
 Nice to meet you, I'm Sophie. 
 Ma'am. 
 Mmm, please, no ma'am. 
 Oh. 
 And how is your mother? 
 Um... I'm not so sure. 
 Well, what is it? 
 Can I talk to you alone? 
 I can't do this anymore. 
 She used to be so sweet. 
 When the kids were little, she just doted on 'em. 
 They just loved to come visit their  Oma. 
 But now... she's a cranky old bitch. 
 Well, she always has been a character. 
 No, she's changed. 
 We all change, Sophie, I mean, um... 
 (SCREAMING) 
 I still think of myself as a 20-year-old buck, and then I look at myself in the mirror, and I don't recognize that old fart staring back at me. 
 No. It's the things she says. 
 It's the foul bile that comes out of her mouth. 
 She called my 13-year-old daughter a whore. 
 It's like the devil's got ahold of her tongue. 
 Somebody out there? 
 Who is it?! 
 (CLOCK CHIMING) 
 I'm with the reverend. 
 Well, get in here. 
 Ma'am. 
 We're dropping off your groceries. I'm Kyle Barnes. 
 I know who you are. 
 Pity about your mother. 
 Oh. Um... Thank you. 
 It's a nice place you got here. 
 Used to be. 
 But everything goes to sh1t eventually. 
 Like your marriage. 
 It's hard to keep a romance alive once you start throwing punches, isn't it? 
 Okay. 
 What about the Austin boy? 
 I saw his face. 
 You... You can't seem to help yourself. 
 I think I'm gonna go get the reverend for you. 
 What'd you see? 
 What? 
 With the boy? 
 When you did that to him, what'd you see? 
 (SCOFFS) 
 Here. Let me help. 
 (SCREAMS) No! 
 Are you okay? 
 Don't touch me! Don't! 
 All right, all right. 
 What happened? 
 Mama? 
 She fell. 
 Oh... 
 All right. Let me help you. 
 Come on. Take it easy. 
 All right, Mildred, I got you. 
 Oh. 
 There you go. 
 (GROANING) 
 God bless your kind soul, Reverend. 
 You know I appreciate your help so much. 
 But I'm not up for a visit today. 
 What happened in there? 
 She was asking me questions about Joshua, about what we saw that night. 
 I'm not surprised. 
 People are always looking for lurid details. 
 When she fell, I went to help her, and when I touched her, she reacted just like Joshua, and Blake. 
 She's one of 'em, isn't she? 
 She's one of the ones you exorcised. 
 About two years ago. 
 Took me almost a week to drive the demon from her. 
 And? Was it like with Joshua? Did you see it come out? 
 I told you, it's not always like that. 
 Then how can you be sure it's gone? 
 Because I have faith in the power of God over the devil. 
 Things change, Kyle. People get old. 
 Sometimes we lose something of ourselves. 
 But that lady's been sitting in the front pew of my church for the past two years, singing hymns and praising the Lord. 
 I hope I'd know if I was preaching to a demon.

 It's a good thing I rode into town.

 What? No.

 No. 
 Damn it, Kyle, don't you lie to me.

 How much did she tell you? 
 Just that he was a foster kid her parents took in, and... and he abused her. 
 She never told me his name. 
 m*therf*cker told me himself. 
 He literally came right up to me. 
 He said, "Hi, I'm Donnie." 
 He say anything else? 
 No. 
 Just that he and Megan, they went way back. 
 When I found out what he was doing, I started sleeping on the floor in her room. 
 I couldn't... couldn't fight back and win or nothing. 
 I could get in the way, take a beating. 
 I was an old pro at that.

 Holes can be filled. 
 There's room inside a human soul for so much more, Reverend.
