 (Theme music playing) 
 (Grunts) 
 Christ compels you to leave this man in peace. Be gone, demon. 
 (Grunts) 
 Come on, be gone. Be gone! 
 (Screams, grunts) 
 (Grunting continues) 
 (Screams) 
 It burns! 
 (Screams) 
 It's all right, son! It's all right! 
 (Sobs) 
 It burns! 
 (Sobbing continues) 
 It's all right. 
 It's gone. 
 It's gone. I can... I can feel it going out of me like... like Satan's fingers were squeezing my heart... and then suddenly just let go. 
 Thank you, Reverend. 
 Praise Jesus. Thank you. 
 Bless you. 
 (Breathing heavily) 
 (Grunts) 
 (Growls) 
 By the power of the Almighty, I cast you out. 
 (Screams) 
 Take me! 
 Satan, take me! 
 Cover yourself, harlot! 
 Take me! Take me! 
 Anderson : Cover yourself! 
 (Laughs maniacally) 
 Cast this demon out! 
 (Screams) 
 (Screams) 
 Come out, demon! Come out! 
 (Screams) 
 (Screaming continues) 
 Cast you out! 
 (Screams) 
 In the name of God,  (Possessed people screaming)  the Son, the Lord Jesus Christ... 
 I command you, demon, leave this lady's body! 
 (Screaming) 
 Praise Jesus. 
 Thank you. 
 (Screams) 
 Loosen the child's hold! 
 Burn! 
 No! 
 Burn the demon out of you! 
 (Possessed person screaming) 
 I condemn this demon in your body. 
 I cast you out! 
 (Screams)

 (Banging and crashing)

 Patricia : Hello? 
 Hello? 
 (Door rattles) 
 Hi. 
 Hi. 
 What are you doing here? 
 (Exhales) 
 I'm sorry. 
 Um, I've been working, and... research. 
 I didn't get much sleep. 
 Uh, is there something that I can help you with? 
 No, no. It's, uh, it's a personal project. 
 There anything I can do for you? 
 No, I just... haven't seen you for a few days, so... thought I'd come by, make sure everything is all right. 
 I'm fine. 
 I'm busy. 
 Because... if you've been having second thoughts about... taking this any further... 
 I'd like to know now. 
 (Chuckles) 
 Come on, don't be silly. 
 If it's a bad idea, let's just save each other a lot of grief. 
 Patricia, um... 
 I... I got a lot to attend to. 
 I'll call you later. 
 Don't bother. 
 I learned more about my husband after the accident cleaning out his locker at work... going through the glove compartment of his truck... than I did 17 years sharing a bed with him. 
 I'm not gonna do that again. 
 Come with me. 
 (Door closes) 
 Anderson : Don't be afraid. 
 (Banging) 
 It's no secret what I do. 
 Everybody knows it needs to be done. 
 Nobody really wants to see what's behind the curtain. 
 (Banging) 
 Are you sure about this? 
 Yes. 
 (Man screaming) 
 (Screaming continues) 
 Patricia : Oh, my god! 
 Barnes, wake up. 
 Hey, get over here with the brush. 
 Now go on. 
 (Chattering) 
 Lisa : That's gross. 
 Mark : Tell me about it. 
 Ripped out from the root. 
 Must have hurt like hell. 
 Put that thing away before I puke all over your desk. 
 So, you're telling me that's not yours? 
 Oh. 
 I can get wild, Officer. 
 I think I'd remember losing a nail. 
 That's got your DNA. 
 Well, if I had a nickel for every place I left some DNA. 
 Look, some ugly sh1t happened where we found this. 
 I just want to know what. 
 Who was there, somebody got hurt... 
 Wouldn't know. 
 You're sure? 
 DNA doesn't lie. 
 There are a lot of men on death row who might disagree with you. 
 All right, so there's nothing you can tell me about an old camper in the woods, a bunch of bloody carcasses nailed to trees? 
 I'm not real outdoorsy. 
 Where did you disappear to last August? 
 I took a trip. 
 Where? 
 Disneyland. 
 It's none of your f*ckin' business. 
 And you didn't tell anybody where you were goin'? 
 Left your car in the driveway, didn't take a stitch of clothing, not a wallet, credit card, nothin'? 
 Freaked your boyfriend out enough that he filed a Missing Persons Report. 
 What are you, like 6'3, 6'4? 
 Gun in your holster, big dick in your pants? 
 So, you can't imagine how desperate and scared you have to be to leave your car and your clothes so you can just disappear on your boyfriend. 
 Where were your cops then? 
 Can I go? 
 Yeah. 
 Thanks for the help. 
 (Drawer opening) 
 Is this how it's supposed to be? 
 sh1t! 
 Nothing's working. 
 Patricia : The cross, all the scripture reading, nothing's doing anything! 
 It feels it. 
 Every blessed word. 
 What are you doing? 
 f*ck! 
 (Whispers)  Sweet Lord Jesus Christ. 
 It was the blood. 
 It must have been. 
 It was the only thing we did differently with Joshua. 
 And it worked for Kyle. 
 Kyle? Kyle Barnes? 
 Maybe I should go get him. 
 No! f*ck him! 
 He thinks he's special. 
 That it's him the demons are feared of. 
 I'm just scared you're not gonna be able... 
 Then go. Fear gives them strength, and if that's what you bring here, I don't need you! 
 (Man groans) 
 (Door opens) 
 (Sighs) 
 Who's there? 
 Patricia McCready. 
 From the Light of God Church. 
 We've met before. 
 I need to talk to you. 
 Well, what are you doin' sittin' in your car in the dark? 
 I didn't wanna... bother you, I suppose. 
 You scared of me? 
 (Chuckles) 
 Crazy Kyle Barnes? 
 Rome's own Boo Radley? Is that it? 
 I'm not afraid of you. 
 Not after what I saw today. 
 Reverend caught another live one, huh? 
 He needs your help. 
 He won't ask for it. 
 He thinks he's bein' tested. 
 It's one thing to hear him talk about it on Sunday, dark forces. 
 I never imagined what it'd be like face to face. 
 Yeah, well, he's the expert on all of that, so you're in good hands. 
 Goodnight. 
 What's the matter with you? 
 How can you just walk away? 
 We've heard what you can do! 
 Lady, you want to see what I can do? 
 Why don't you have the Reverend take you down to Charleston? 
 There's a girl lying in the ICU down there with tubes coming out of her and a blank stare in her eyes. 
 That's what I can do. 
 So you... you're gonna hide in there? 
 Pretend this isn't happening? 
 Better than makin' it worse. 
 You all think you know who I am. 
 I'm the guy who beat his wife and his daughter. 
 That ain't the half of it. 
 Know who you're not? 
 Boo Radley. 
 Guess it's been a while since you read the book. 
 In the end, he turns out to be a hero. 
 (Bottle shatters) 
 Woman on TV : Are you invested in gold? 
 Are you a financial planner with clients interested in gold? 
 Maybe you've considered gold, but the commissions were just too high. 
 (Knocking) 
 Man on TV : Commissions? 
 I'm convinced the market's gonna crash! 
 (Knocking continues) 
 With the US dollar falling and inflation rising, I've already converted considerable amounts of my assets into gold. 
 (Knocking continues) 
 Woman on TV : I remember the 70's when gold went through the roof! 
 Man on TV  It's true. 
 Gold's the perfect investment for my son's future. 
 Woman on TV : Now is the time to own gold again. 
 (Knocking continues) 
 Gold savings accounts, gold investment accounts. 
 Gold IRA accounts. 
 U.S. coins, international coins, certified coins. 
 Fiscal delivery and storage. 
 Call the International Gold and Silver Brokers Association and receive the lowest possible payment. 
 (TV chatter continues) 
 (Grunts) 
 Man on TV : Okay, shoppers, you know what that sound is. 
 It's our Bonus Buy sound. 
 Today only at the Worldwide Shopping Channel, we have a beautiful, beautiful... 
 (Breathes shakily) 
 Uh... 
 What... what... 
 Shh. 
 Save your breath. 
 (Grunts) 
 (Inhales) 
 (Grunts) 
 I'm sorry, sweetie. 
 (Grunts) 
 You're not supposed to be just for me, but I need this. 
 (Grunts) 
 Shh. 
 (Yelps) 
 (Grunts) 
 Grace. 
 (Sighs) 
 Dear Lord, bless this meal. 
 May the food nourish us and may the fellowship enrich our lives. 
 Most of all, may we always invite you into our home and into our hearts. 
 Amen. 
 Amen. 
 Where were you last night? 
 I dropped in on the reverend. 
 Offered him my services. 
 I'll bet you did. 
 Don't be crude. 
 You don't have to be so weird about it. 
 I know you're bangin' Old Balls. 
 Aaron. 
 Are you gonna deny it? 
 Why are you always like this? 
 'Cause every time you meet somebody, you meet dicks. 
 You invite them to dinner and then you f*ck 'em so they won't run away. 
 That's enough. 
 But they always do anyway. 
 Right after they sh1t all over you. 
 Do you like being like this? 
 Do you hate yourself that much? 
 Reverend Anderson is a good, kind, brave man. 
 He is not a dick. 
 Okay, you're right, Mom. 
 Sorry. 
 Reverend Anderson isn't a dick. 
 In fact, he's the opposite of a dick. 
 He's a pussy. 
 May I be excused? 
 Or do you want to talk about the guy who nailed you at your prom? 
 Well, that would have been your father. 
 Six months, six days. 
 Then I'm 18 and I'm out of here forever. 
 Man on TV : And as you can see here, the cheese that will go on later. 
 I'll set that down. 
 And I have pre-prepped...  (Gasps)  some of the other vegetables that I'll be putting in the salad. 
 (Breathing shakily) 
 (TV chatter continues) 
 (Gasps) 
 (Clattering) 
 What are you doin'? 
 Mornin'. 
 Low oil light came on. 
 You ignore the signs, the next thing you know, you go up in flames, am I right? 
 I mean what are you doing here? 
 We buried Norville over three weeks ago. 
 Just packin' up his things. 
 You know, he didn't have any family. 
 Lived out here like a... like a hermit. 
 Place will probably go into probate eventually. 
 His whole life will end up in a dumpster. 
 Been nice, spending time out here, feeling his presence. 
 You seen anybody else out here? 
 You all right, son? 
 You... you want me to have a look at that? 
 Uh... I... I'll take care of it. 
 I gotta get to work. 
 (Door closes) 
 
 
 
 See? He's fine. 
 What are you doing here? 
 Well, you don't seem very happy to see me. 
 Especially after all we've been through. 
 You want to give me a ride? 
 I explained this to you. 
 We did what we did, and now you move on. 
 Sometimes it's not that easy. 
 That's not my problem. 
 Now get out of here before Kat sees you. 
 Fine. 
 Just want to warn you, cops know about the camper. 
 They talked to you? 
 Who was it? Giles? 
 Younger cop. Big guy. 
 Said I left some DNA in it. 
 I'm sure you did. 
 Don't worry about the camper. I already took care of it. 
 You take care of everything. 
 f*ck. 
 Sidney : Norville was a man who found purpose in serving a higher cause. 
 Dedication. 
 Selflessness. 
 Things that can give a life real meaning. 
 Things you obviously don't give a rat's ass about. 
 I'm... I'm sorry. 
 You're not here to enjoy this world. 
 To have a good time. 
 Do you know how many you might have sacrificed if I hadn't stopped you? 
 I was just trying to have a little fun. 
 I wouldn't have hurt him. 
 It's nothin' compared to what Reverend Anderson's doin'. 
 That man could cause a lot of harm. 
 Don't worry. 
 I'll deal with the reverend. 
 I know how his kind thinks. 
 What about me? 
 (Car honks) 
 Keep goin'! 
 Go, go! Keep goin'! 
 You wearing your sunscreen? 
 Yes. 
 Liar. 
 Don't. 
 I see how hard you're tryin'. 
 Proud of you. 
 Why are you saying that? 
 I understand you want to help, but... she don't want it. 
 Not yet. 
 Don't matter what happened. 
 Amber's my daughter and I'm responsible. 
 And you're showin' them that. 
 But the rest of the world don't operate on your timeline. 
 Look, you're making good choices, gettin' your life together. 
 Not hanging out with that revered. 
 That's over with. I told you. 
 I'm done with all that. 
 Good. 
 Still though... don't you think there's things that we don't understand yet? 
 I know... I know it sounds crazy, but Megan, I've seen things that I can't explain. 
 Yeah, it sounds crazy. 
 (Phone rings) 
 Four-three-four? 
 Don't know who that is. 
 I'll eat it later. 
 Okay. 
 I'm gonna get back to work. 
 All right. 
 Thanks for the lovely picnic. 
 You are such a f*ckin' weirdo. 
 Hey. 
 What? 
 Love you. 
 I know. 
 (Chuckles)  Love you, too. 
 (Phone rings) 
 (Ringing continues) 
 Hello, who is this? 
 Hm. 
 What's goin' on? 
 What do you mean? 
 Damn kids again. 
 I've been trying to call you all morning. 
 Thought you might like to know one of your flock's gone wandering. 
 Mildred Robson is missing. 
 She's one of your... special cases, wasn't she? 
 She still is. 
 What do you mean? 
 It means the devil's still got a control of her. 
 Well, hold on. 
 H... hold on, hold on now. 
 She may be as mean as a striped snake, but that don't mean she's possessed by the devil. 
 You gave her an exorcism. 
 It didn't work. 
 You sure? 
 Course I'm f*cking sure! 
 Well, are there others? 
 There are, aren't there? 
 Walkin' around town, sittin' in your church with the devil inside of 'em. 
 I have followed your play for years. 
 Looked the other way, hushed things up, all because people believe you were doing the Lord's work, fightin' back the Devil. 
 What do you wanna hear? 
 That I'm a fraud? 
 A charlatan? 
 Get in f*cking line! 
 (Overlapping chatter) 
 You came. 
 (Chuckles) 
 (Grunts)  I thought I didn't matter to you. 
 Cut the crap. 
 Why don't you tell me what you want and what it has to do with Mark so I can get the f*ck out of here? 
 You don't know. 
 Know what? 
 (Exhales) 
 Megan, your husband did this. 
 Bullshit. Bullshit. 
 Look, Megan, I was in town to sell tires. 
 Honest to God, that is all. 
 You asked me to go, and I was goin', but now I have a doctor telling me I might have brain damage and I might have seizures for the rest of my life. 
 What do you want? 
 There's two ways that this can play out. 
 Version one: I had a little too much to drink, got into it with some locals in the parking lot, and jeez, I just...  (Chuckles)  I could not get a good look at their face. End of story. 
 Version two... well, version two has me gettin' a lawyer and tellin' the truth about what happened, and your husband goes to jail. 
 Choice is all yours, Megan. 
 Either way, you're gonna have some fun. 
 (Bubbling) 
 Where are you goin'? 
 I gotta go. 
 Whoa, whoa, hold on, son. 
 We still got three hours of daylight left. 
 I took a chance on you! 
 I gave you a break when nobody in town would touch you! 
 (Engine starts) 
 I know I said I was doing your work, Lord. 
 It's what I tried to say to my congregation. 
 It's what I tried to tell myself. 
 That I was called. 
 I didn't have a choice. 
 (Man screaming) 
 It's a lie, Lord. 
 I did it because I loved it. 
 The attention. 
 The praise. 
 The feeling of power. 
 Your power. 
 And if I offended you... 
 I'm sorry. 
 And if this is my punishment... 
 I humbly accept it. 
 (Banging) 
 Man : No! 
 (Grunts) 
 Rev, open up! 
 Gotta talk to ya! 
 (Banging) 
 (Man grunts) 
 (Screams) 
 Kyle : Reverend Anderson! 
 I need to talk to ya. 
 I thought I was insane. 
 Isn't that what you told me? 
 God was laughing at me? 
 That is, if he even exists. 
 Come on, don't be an asshole. 
 (Chuckles)  Me being an asshole? 
 Mighty Kyle Barnes. 
 Hey... 
 Who crawled back in his hole to hide! 
 But no, I'm the asshole because I keep trying even though my whole life now appears to be a f*cking joke! 
 (Man grunts) 
 I... I'm sure you got more important things to do that don't involve giving a sh1t about anybody other than yourself! 
 No, listen to me... 
 No. 
 Listen... 
 No, you go on home! Go home! 
 Go stick your head in the sand or... or up your own ass! 
 Whatever! 
 That was the plan, Reverend, till last night Mildred attacked me. 
 You mean attacked? 
 Last night. 
 She would have killed me if something hadn't stopped her. 
 Something? 
 Or someone. 
 Who? 
 (Man screams) 
 (Banging) 
 Reverend, who is that? 
 Is that her? 
 Do you have Mildred back there? 
 I don't... I don't need your help. 
 I'm not offering. 
 I don't need your help! 
 This is my test! 
 Rev... 
 My trial! 
 (Screams) 
 (Grunts) 
 Don't let him out! 
 That's right, Caleb. 
 You look to the power of God's holy light. 
 He won't abandon you. 
 Caleb! 
 Don't touch him, Kyle! 
 Come on. 
 Goddammit, he's mine! 
 (Screams) 
 (Caleb breathes heavily) 
 (Sobs quietly) 
 You were right. 
 I can't run away from this. 
 If I ever want to see my family again, I gotta know that this isn't comin' for me. 
 So, I say we go out and fight it. 
 I don't see that we have much other choice. 
 But we gotta be clear on one thing. 
 In there on Sundays, you're in charge. 
 If we're gonna do this together, we do it my way. 
 Or we don't do it at all. 
 (Door opens) 
 How you feelin'? 
 Uh... 
 I'm all right, I guess. 
 A little sore. 
 Reverend, um, I don't even know where to start. 
 I'm so sorry. 
 Why? Don't worry about the mess. 
 Make a fine visual aid for, uh, your story on Sunday morning. 
 My brothers and sisters and me, we were raised to believe that there's no worse torment than being touched by the devil. 
 Well... you were raised up right. 
 But I didn't feel any torment. 
 I felt... 
 I felt this warmth. 
 I figured it was just the sun, but then... 
 I felt like there was a hole being drilled in the top of my head. 
 And the warmth... poured into me through the hole and filled up my whole body. 
 That was the demon taking over your body. 
 But I wasn't afraid. 
 The devil was seducing you. 
 That's how they work. 
 Reverend... 
 I've been coming here every Sunday my whole life because I was afraid. 
 Afraid of dyin'. 
 Afraid of goin' to hell. 
 But this... this did not feel like something I should be afraid of. 
 Caleb, uh... 
 I'm not saying you aren't doing good work here, Reverend. 
 I can't get up there on Sunday morning and tell these folks that they need to be afraid. 
 Not anymore. 
 Thank you, Reverend. 
 Hey! 
 You and I gotta talk. 
 sh1t. 
 Giles : You can take her on away now. 
 This isn't exactly on your way home. 
 I called 911. 
 Look, am I in trouble? 
 I was trying to do the right thing here. 
 Well, there's a first time for everything, I guess. 
 Can I go? 
 Our friend, the Reverend, says that you have a particular knack for this thing that he does. 
 She attacked me last night. 
 She attacked you? 
 She only weighs 90 pounds. 
 She's about 112 years old. 
 She was spry. 
 She wanted something from me. 
 All of 'em do. 
 All of 'em? 
 Yeah. 
 Whatever your friend the Reverend has been doing the last 20 years, hadn't done sh1t. 
 I don't know where they come from or what they want, but... 
 I know she's not the only one out there. 
 (Sighs) 
 Hm. 
 Huh. 
 (Sighs) 
 Mark : Hey. 
 You're late. 
 I know. Sorry. 
 Some old lady's heart gives out and it's all hands on deck. 
 Don't. You'll wake her. 
 Well, it's a little crowded. 
 Leave her. 
 I like her here. 
 ♪ ♪ 
 (Man clears throat) 
 How did you get in here? 
 It's easy for me to go wherever I please. 
 Who are you? 
 I saw the way you looked at me, that day in your church. 
 You knew. 
 Didn't you? 
 But you were just afraid to tell anybody. 
 They'd think you lost your mind.  (Chuckles) 
 You get out of my house. 
 I've seen what you've been doing, you and Kyle Barnes, to my compatriots. 
 (Grunts) 
 It has to stop. 
 (Anderson screams) 
 (Gasping) 
 Remember this warning. 
 (Door closes)
