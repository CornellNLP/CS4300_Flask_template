 WOMAN: Thanks, sweetie. 
 Come again. 
 MAN: Thank you, Vella. 
 Have a good day. 
 You too, now. 
 Oh, howdy, Sarah. 
 - Hi, Vella. 
 - Got your order all set and ready. 
 That'll be $  .  . 
 Sure you don't want to grab a booth? 
 Haven't seen the family for quite a bit. 
 Oh, we can't today, but we owe you a visit. 
 You keep that change. 
 God bless you, darling. 
 Love to little Kyle. 
 Okay, Kyle. 
 Let's see... 
 I got you a grilled cheese. 
 (squish) 
 Police. 
 I know you're here. 
 Nothing to worry about. 
 Just a... 
 friendly civil servant, looking to retire with his ass intact. 
 (clattering) 
 Hello there. 
 I see you're not quite feeling yourself. 
 But we are gonna get that all fixed up. 
 Now come on, son. 
 I know you got folks out there worried about you. 
 You got folks wondering where ya are. 
 Don't move! 
 Freeze! 
 Stop! 
 m*therf*cker! 
 Stop! 
 Damn it! 
 I said, freeze! 
 Stop! 
 (grunting) 
 Son, look at me! 
 Look at me, son! 
 Look at me! 
 I can help you through this. 
 Stop! 
 Jesus. 
 Daddy? 
 Yeah, Firefly? 
 When are we gonna get there? 
 When we get there. 
 Can I sit in the front seat? 
 I think you still got some growing to do. 
 I'm not a little kid anymore. 
 You're safer back there. 
 But I wanna sit with you. 
 I know you do. 
 Are you scared? 
 Climb up. 
 There you go. 
 Click it or ticket.

 What happened? 
 I burned it. 
 Fire is the devil's tool. 
 That's how he gets his rocks off. 
 I thought Sidney would appreciate the irony. 
 He's dead? 
 What do you know? 
 He wasn't home. 
 I f*cked that up, too. 
 He's the only person who knows what this is. 
 Maybe the only one who knows how to stop it and you tried to kill him? 
 What are you doing here anyway? 
 I thought you were heading for the hills. 
 We got two states away and they were all around us. 
 They can sense us, Amber and me. 
 They're everywhere. 
 Are you surprised? 
 You think the devil is local? 
 Sticks to the tri-county area? 
 - Where's Sidney? 
 - No idea. 
 Didn't figure I'd find him here, but I was hoping I'd find something that might point me in the right direction. 
 So much for that. 
 He told me we're from the same place. 
 I'm not from hell. 
 Well, Lucifer was originally from heaven. 
 But he made his own hell, just like the rest of us. 
 Save it for Bible study, Rev. 
 - For goodness sake. 
 - Rev? 
 (chuckles) 
 Rev, I used to be proud of that little old nickname. 
 Now I detect a certain condescension,    like a "kick me" sign on my back. 
 Maybe Sidney isn't the devil,    f*ck if I know. 
 At least I believed in something. 
 You... you... 
 you're just swinging in the dark. 
 KYLE: That's right, I am. 
 That's why I came back. 
 Doesn't make any damn sense for me to keep running from the only person who believes me. 
 I can't help you. 
 I got no weapons left. 
 I don't have anybody else. 
 NUNEZ: Hey! 
 You can't be out here! 
 We were just leaving. 
  Okay, well then get your ass moving. 
  Until we sift through this mess, this is a crime scene. 
  All right. 
  Back so soon? 
  Figured you'd be half way to Texas by now. 
  Yeah. 
 Change of plans. 
  Thanks for letting me know. 
  And how 'bout you, sweetheart? 
 How you doing? 
  I really have to pee. 
  Oh, well, go on inside, honey. 
 Go. 
 Go, go, go. 
  How's Megan doing? 
  (door opens) 
  Hey, Megan. 
  It's me. 
  Will you talk to me? 
  I knew you'd hate coming here, but... 
  I couldn't think of anyplace else. 
  Least no one'll come looking for us. 
  I'm gonna take care of you and Holly. 
  Megan... 
  do you remember anything? 
  ANDERSON: Patricia. 
  (sighs) 
 Hello, John. 
  How are you holding up? 
  I needed to do something. 
  I want to talk to you. 
  Patricia, I'm so sorry. 
  It's not your fault he ran off. 
  - I drove him away. 
 - That's not true. 
  I was supposed to be the parent. 
  Always putting my child before everything else. 
  You could not have done more. 
  He was slipping away, but I was just so lonely. 
  Patricia... 
  I did anything I could to keep a man in my life so I'd feel loved just for a while. 
  Pray for forgiveness. 
  He hated me for it. 
  "Town slut," he called me. 
  You have nothing to be forgiven for. 
  All right, nothing. 
  Will you help me find him? 
  Of course I will. 
  AMBER: Catch anything? 
  KYLE: Amber! 
  Hey! 
  You gotta stay where Mrs. 
 Giles can see you. 
 Okay? 
  I was talking to Holly. 
  Yeah? 
  What did she say? 
  Nothing really. 
  Look... 
  (sighs) 
  She's gonna need a lot of understanding from us. 
  We can do that, right? 
  Did you come here when you were a kid? 
  Yeah, a few times after Aunt Megan's family took me in. 
  It's pretty. 
  Why didn't we ever come? 
  Well, it wasn't really a happy place for me and Aunt Megan. 
  I gotta go see someone. 
  I wanna go with you. 
  I know you do, but you can't. 
  I don't want to stay here if this is a bad place. 
  I didn't say "bad." I just said it's not a happy place. 
 That's all. 
  Besides, I'll be back soon, okay? 
  You said you weren't gonna lie to me ever again. 
  I will be back soon. 
  Besides, you can take care of yourself. 
  We both saw that. 
  And you got Mrs. 
 Giles looking after you. 
  She's a badass, so... 
  You shouldn't say "ass." Yeah, well, if you're big enough to sit in the front seat, I think you can handle it... 
  - smart-ass. 
 - (giggles) 
  Come here. 
  I love you, Firefly. 
  I love you, too. 
  All right, promise to behave. 
  Stay where she can see you. 
 Okay? 
  GILES: Hell's bells, Owen! 
  We got a dangerous fugitive out there. 
  And you can't tell me who. 
  I didn't get a good look at him. 
  A... 
 And... 
 And dangerous, how, exactly? 
  So he breaks into old Gene's diner,     - that's trespassing... 
 - Resisting arrest, assaulting a police officer, namely me. 
  And for that you want a curfew, you want emergency funds for extra man power, all to catch a trespasser? 
 Come on. 
  I got a deranged individual out there, and since when do I need to clear police business with you? 
  I'm the mayor, everything that happens in this town is my business. 
  - Uh, I'm sorry, Owen. 
 - Howdy, folks. 
  I thought selling dishwashers was your business and mine was keeping the peace. 
 Wasn't that our arrangement? 
  I'm sorry, I've got customers. 
  Arrangements can change, Chief. 
 Fortunes can turn, you remember our old friend, the reverend, huh? 
  When you start losing support from people who count in this town, you might end up very lonely indeed. 
 You understand? 
  Yes, your honor. 
  Your customers await. 
  Hey there. 
 Hi. 
  How are you? 
 What can I help you with here? 
  - Looking at this one. 
 - Well, that's a beaut... 
  ♪     You are like the proverbial bad penny. 
  What in the hell are we doing out here? 
  I need to find Sidney. 
  Well, good luck with that, son. 
  He's a lot smarter than that. 
 He's long gone by now. 
  No, he isn't. 
  And you know this how? 
  Because I'm still here. 
 He's got plans for me. 
  Long as I'm around, he's not going anywhere. 
  Why did you come to me? 
  'Cause I trust you. 
  What you did for my sister. 
  I'm still trying to... 
  work out some of the small details on that. 
  Known associates. 
  You want to find someone, you go after the people they're close to. 
  I don't know that Sidney was close to anyone but your friend the fire chief and his wife. 
  Already checked that out. 
 They're ghosts. 
  Well, I gotta start somewhere. 
  I need something from you. 
  You know that one that got away that night from that horror show in the department store? 
  Mm-hmm. 
  He's still out there. 
  I chased him out of the diner last night. 
  Find him. 
  I'll do what I can... 
  if it isn't too late for him. 
  Know what the scariest thing about that night? 
  Is that a trick question? 
  The scariest thing was that eight people chained in an abandoned building for what? 
 Days, weeks? 
  And not one of them was reported missing. 
  Scary. 
  And you come and do your thing and they just go on about their lives. 
  The whole town swallows them up like nothing ever happened. 
  Makes you wonder how far this thing goes.

  My wife. 
 Hm! 
 She swore one day I'd die in this chair. 
  Said there are worse ways to go. 
  Where's Sidney? 
  The Beacon. 
  The Beacon, he kept calling you. 
  He say anything else? 
  Just that... 
 great days are comin'. 
  Oh yeah, for who? 
  Not you, that's for damn sure. 
  (chuckles) 
  Where did he go? 
  He took my truck. 
  Him and Kat. 
  (chuckles) 
  That sounds like a country song.

  Hey, hey. 
  You're not one of them. 
 Why go along with all this? 
  Whatever else she was, she's still my wife. 
  They gave me that back. 
  Where is she now? 
 Huh? 
 With him. 
  She was playing you. 
  You dragged people into that basement, human beings. 
 You tied them up and you... 
  All I did was pick 'em up, that's it. 
  How did he know where to find them? 
 Who they were? 
  He just knew. 
  Had a bunch of names and sent me out to get them. 
  And you did. 
  (laughing, crying) 
  You... 
 Heh, you think he's just some sick old man? 
  - That he's afraid of you? 
 - I want those names. 
  I bet you do. 
  No! 
  (gunshot) 
  (choking, sputtering) 
  Ogden! 
 sh1t! 
  Give me the names! 
 Please! 
  He did this to you. 
 He took your life away from you. 
  Help me stop him, please. 
  Where's Holly? 
  In the bedroom, I think. 
  No, she's not. 
  I went to start dinner and she disappeared. 
  Did she go outside? 
  I don't think so. 
  Dammit. 
  Okay, you wait right here. 
  Don't go outside, and do not open that door for anyone but me. 
  - Okay? 
 - Okay. 
  Aunt Megan? 
  You didn't hurt Uncle Mark. 
  It was the black thing. 
  My dad says it's like you're a puppet and the black thing is pulling your strings. 
  (ceiling creaking) 
  MAN: And like a tidal wave, it washed over me! 
  (exclaiming) 
 It's pushing me down, deeper and deeper. 
  The pressure crushing me, the darkness, the cold. 
  Oh, yes! 
  MAN: Like the depths of the sea. 
  It's almost over. 
  I guess it can seem pretty intense the first time. 
  MAN: The breath leaving me. 
  I'm used to it. 
  Then why are you leaving? 
  MAN: ...and pulled me to the surface. 
  I'm familiar with the product, I'm just not in the market right now. 
  People don't just wander in here. 
  You made it this far, you're definitely shopping for somethin'. 
  I wish I could tell you what. 
  Want help finding out? 
  ANDERSON: I thought I knew all the churches around here. 
  WOMAN: Church is too formal. 
  We're just people who have had a personal transformation. 
  Seen the darkness, and we're ready to find our place in the light. 
  That's the tricky part, isn't it? 
  You have a glorious evening. 
  (service continues indistinct) 
  Door's always open! 
 
 
 
  (phone ringing) 
  Kyle? 
  Holly? 
  Holly, are you okay? 
  What are you doing? 
  Hiding. 
  From your mom? 
  From you. 
  You made my mom sick. 
  We never should have let you come to our house. 
  What are you doing out here? 
  Your friend, Ogden? 
  Gave me the names of everybody he rounded up for Sidney. 
  There's only one person on that list that we didn't take care of that night. 
  I can't. 
 I'm here 'cause of you. 
 All right? 
  You're the one who told me there's a house like this on every street in the whole world. 
  I found out you were right. 
  Help me, Rev. 
  (scratching) 
  Joshua? 
  Why are you sitting in the dark? 
  I'm pretending no one's home. 
  Why, is that some kind of game? 
  So you will leave us alone. 
  Is that what you want? 
 You want to be left alone? 
  I'm not supposed to say. 
  Joshua, did your father come home? 
  ANDERSON: It's all right, son. 
  Joshua. 
  They said you'd hurt him. 
  Who said that? 
  My mom. 
  And the white-haired man. 
  Your mother? 
  Is he here? 
 The white-haired man? 
  They said what you did to me was bad. 
  That you hurt me... and you should go to jail. 
  I'm sorry. 
  It got my mom and dad... 
  like it got me. 
  Tell me where they are. 
  I'll get in trouble. 
  Who told you that? 
  The white-haired man tell you that? 
  Well, he's the one in trouble now, okay? 
  Joshua, I can help. 
  Tell me where they took your dad. 
  Is it him? 
  Can't tell. 
  It was really buried under the debris. 
  We only uncovered a little bit of it. 
  GILES: Christ. 
  We didn't want to touch it until you got here. 
  Contaminating the scene, you know. 
  Well, get him up out of there. 
  Try not to disturb anything else, I need to know what started this. 
  What? 
 So you mean, just dig it up? 
  Is there a problem? 
  Yeah, actually. 
  Look, I'm not an arson investigator. 
 Okay? 
  Why are we even digging around in here? 
  - Shouldn't we call the state police? 
 - No. 
  This one is all ours. 
  - Chief, I... 
 - You got a hearing problem, Nunez? 
  No, sir. 
  I can hear you fine. 
  Chief, you got a phone call! 
  All right. 
  ANDERSON: At least wait until Giles gets here. 
  We gotta finish it. 
  Kyle, don't be so damn foolish. 
  sh1t. 
  Betsy. 
  Get off my property. 
  Where's Sidney? 
 Are you protecting him? 
  This is a family matter. 
  Betsy, he's only trying to help you. 
  f*ck off, preacher. 
  Hold her. 
  What, you're gonna beat me like you did my boy? 
  No. 
  You damn near killed him. 
  Help me. 
  No wonder they kicked you out of the church. 
  No! 
  (sizzling) 
 Aah! 
  (screaming) 
  It's okay! 
 It's all right. 
  It's okay! 
  You're ripping me apart! 
  Something's wrong. 
  Kyle, something's wrong here. 
  Aah! 
  sh1t. 
  When did it happen, Betsy? 
 How long has it been? 
  She's too far gone. 
 There's nothing I can do. 
  Just... watch her. 
 I'll be back. 
  You can't go out there on your own! 
  These things tore my life apart, I'm not letting that happen to Joshua. 
  What if that's exactly what Sidney's counting on? 
  What... 
 What if he's waiting for you? 
  That's what I'm hoping. 
  It's okay. 
 I'm here to help you. 
  Your son's out there, Joshua. 
  Joshua? 
  He needs his father. 
  You are the one who saved him. 
  That's right. 
  You did not save anybody, Outcast. 
  You just delayed the inevitable. 
  Aah! 
  (groaning) 
  - (sizzling) 
 - Aah! 
  Aah! 
  (screaming) 
  You can't send any more of us back. 
  (gunshots) 
  (coughing) 
  No! 
  (panting) 
  No, no! 
  (sobbing) 
  Where is it? 
  Where is what? 
  The thing inside of him. 
  The thing he should be free of. 
  BETSY: Doesn't work that way. 
  Once we're here, really here completely, there's no going back. 
  (sobbing) 
  Dear lord, what happened? 
  Are the girls okay? 
  I've got 'em to bed, finally. 
 Are you okay? 
  I'm sorry I dragged you into all this. 
  You should be at home with your husband. 
  Pretending like everything is fine in this town? 
  I talked to Chief and we have a plan for Megan's... 
 situation. 
  Mark, you know, was fired from the department, and, uh... 
  we're gonna say he killed himself. 
  Yeah, I don't like it, but it... 
  makes sense, I guess. 
 And it clears Megan. 
 So... 
  MEGAN: No f*cking way. 
  Megan! 
  I won't have you disgrace Mark's memory by saying he abandoned his family. 
  I won't. 
  I won't. 
  Go home, John. 
 It's been a long night. 
  Where's that? 
  Well, go to my place. 
 Rose is still up at that cabin, I could use some company. 
  You know where the spare key is. 
  I want you to arrest me. 
  Now, I know you don't have a place to stay, but trust me, jail is not all that fun. 
  I killed Patricia's son. 
  Dammit, John, I am not in a joking mood right now. 
  Burnt down that old trailer that Sidney was living in. 
  Aaron was inside. 
  You should stop talking right now. 
  I thought the Lord was guiding my hand, but it was the devil. 
  I guess Sidney got the last laugh after all. 
  We found a body out there tonight. 
  Now, if you set that fire, we're talking about murder. 
  And I will pay for it in this life or the next. 
  Why don't we get started, huh? 
  - John... 
 - Byron! 
  If you don't do it, I will go to the state police. 
  (machine beeping) 
  Mr. Barnes. 
  Wait here with Grandma, okay? 
 I'll be right back. 
  What's... 
 What's wrong with her? 
  As I told you on the phone, it looks like a stroke. 
  Your mother's been in a catatonic state for nearly    years. 
  No one even knows why. 
  It's nothing short of a miracle she's hung on this long. 
  Just... 
 Just tell me, what's going on? 
  Mr. Barnes, your mother is dying. 
  I'd spend whatever time you can with her and make any preparations you need to. 
  Thank you.
