 (MAN FAKE COUGHS) Choke! 
 (LAUGHING) 
 What are you, 12? Come on. 
 They must've just waxed the lanes. 
 Man : Yeah, I'm sure that's it. 
 I was in the precinct league, 187 average. 
 So, Terry says you and Luke have been partners for six years. 
 Seven, I've been stuck with this guy. 
 Blake was Police Officer of the Year, though, last year. 
 He delivered a baby in the back of a police car. 
 Should've been me. He just got between her legs quicker.

 I feel so much better now. 
 The fat, lonely girl likes me. 
 Blake. 
 Blake : Whoa. 
 (LUKE CHUCKLES) 
 Blake : Hey. 
 Luke : What? What? 
 Blake : I don't know, man. I cannot shake this. 
 Oh. You don't look so good, honey. 
 I feel so weird. 
 Really? 
 Let me drive you home, hmm? 
 Yeah. 
 Pick your car up in the morning. 
 No, no, no, he's not going anywhere. 
 Here, come on, lay down. 
 Wait. 
 Come on, come on. Nice and comfy. 
 Come on. 
 There you go. Run to the store. 
 Grab some Saltines, some soup, and some ginger ale. 
 That'll settle your stomach. 
 Why don't you get your own goddamn wife, huh? 
 Yeah, I was working on that, but someone is not making that very easy. 
 Luke : Mmm. 
 Well, any other woman would be a letdown. 
 Luke : All right, down boy. 
 Terry : Did you hear that? 
 Yes, I heard that. 
 Yeah. Remember. 
 Be right back. 
 Okay. 
 Thanks, man. 
 I'm sorry about tonight. 
 Terry : Call Lorna tomorrow and tell her, okay? 
 Blake : I will. Hey. 
 Luke doesn't realize what a lucky son of a bitch he is. 
 Don't worry. I keep reminding him. 
 Be right back.

 No, it's great. 
 It just adds to all of the wonderful smells in this car.

 Hey, I'm thinking about trying these... electric cigarettes. 
 You know, the ones all the kids are using? 
 They got all kinds of flavors. 
 Mango. 
 Mmm. 
 Peanut brittle. 
 Hell, they even got a pina colada.

 Call me old-fashioned, but I think our vices should leave a... a rotten taste in our mouth.

 That's what God invented the hangover for.

 Luke Masters. 
 Are you ready? There's not a lot of time. 
 Lead on. 
 Just don't get too overeager. 
 Just watch, listen, do as I say. 
 You still got a lot to learn.

 Man : Empty your pockets. 
 Cell phones, drugs, guns, blades, flammable liquids... anything that can be used as a weapon. 
 Only my faith. 
 Open it. 
 You'll have to leave these. 
 Then I might as well turn around right now and go back. 
 I'm not kidding. 
 You'd be surprised what I seen turned into a weapon. 
 I wouldn't go in there with a f*cking paper clip.

 Mark : Chief, can I talk to you about something? 
 It's supposed to rain pretty hard out there tonight. 
 I was thinking maybe I could go back to the camper we found and process the scene. 
 (CHUCKLES ) "Process the scene." 
 Again with that CSI sh1t. 
 I mean, there could be evidence. 
 Oh, what? Bunch of kids smoking pot, giving each other herpes? 
 I appreciate the initiative as always, but what are you expecting to do with this evidence you're collecting? 
 I don't know. If we find something, maybe... give it to the state police. 
 Who's gonna pay for that? 
 You don't even know if a crime has been committed. 
 Look, man, there is blood all over that place. 
 From a bunch of cut up animals. 
 Those carcasses were all done outside the camper. 
 So, what's your explanation, Officer? 
 We got us a Charles Manson living in the woods behind Lowell Grippo's farm? 
 Does that make sense to you? 
 I'll tell you what doesn't make sense to me, is why the f*ck you're so sure nothing happened out there. 
 Sir. 
 All right, Officer. 
 They teach you how to use a fingerprint kit at the community college? 
 Yes, sir. 
 You want to spend your shift tagging beer bottles and used condoms?

 Do what you gotta do. We'll make it work. 
 You heard the man, two hours. 
 (SIGHS) 
 Anderson : Is there anything you haven't told us before we get started? 
 It's pretty straightforward. Blake was my partner for seven years. 
 He was my best friend, and then... 
 This thing in here isn't Blake Morreau. 
 Just watch yourselves. 
 He's restrained, right? 
 It's not that. He... gets inside your head. 
 (BLAKE CHUCKLES) 
 Luke! (LAUGHS) 
 I can't believe you haven't come to see your old pal. 
 Luke : I don't know who you are... but you're not my pal. 
 Come on, don't be that way. 
 How should he be... after you killed his wife? 
 Luke : This is Reverend Anderson and Kyle Barnes. 
 They're here to help you. 
 You all being here is help already. 
 Sit. Please. 
 I'd shake, but... you know. 
 It's awkward. 
 Anderson : Luke here says there's something inside you, something that made you do... what you did. 
 Huh? Inside? 
 Inside? 
 Anderson : That's right. 
 Is that true? 
 Am I talking to the thing inside of this man, Blake Morreau, right now? 
 (LAUGHING) 
 It's not about what's inside of me. 
 Anderson : It's not? 
 Blake : No, no, no, no, no, no. 
 Terry was so warm... 
 Blake, don't. 
 ...and wet inside. 
 (CHOKING) 
 And the deeper I got... 
 (SQUEALS) 
 ...the warmer and wetter she got. 
 And the red... more red than anything I could've imagined. 
 I liked that, but then... the warmness and the wetness poured out onto the floor. 
 And after a while, it got cold, and... I didn't like that.

 I... I'm a little out of practice. 
 I didn't even ask who you are. 
 We're friends of Luke. 
 No, you're not. 
 A Bible thumper and his little sidekick? 
 Luke would f*cking hate a couple of guys like you. 
 Don't get me wrong. I mean, I love the man, but he's not exactly spiritual. 
 If you love him, why kill his wife? 
 Well, now that is a... (SIGHS) somewhat long, complicated story. 
 Even if I were to tell you, I don't... think that you could comprehend it. 
 Kyle : Oh, you might be surprised. 
 You said your friend out there wasn't a spiritual man. 
 Are you? 
 "Though your sins are like scarlet, they shall be white as snow." 
 "Though they are like crimson, they shall be like wool." 
 Isaiah. 
 One of my favorites. 
 How does that make you feel? 
 The Lord's words in your mouth? 
 It makes me sick. 
 Luke and I saw a lot of sin. 
 More than you will ever see in your line of work, Reverend. 
 But what turned my stomach wasn't the sin, it was the forgiveness. 
 People willing to turn the other cheek, forgive... the unforgivable, because it's the Christian thing to do. 
 Look at my pathetic partner out there. 
 I opened up his wife with my bare hands, and he wants to help me. 
 Put that away. (SCOFFS) 
 Our Father, who art in heaven, Oh. 
 ...hallowed be thy name. 
 Get that f*cking thing away from me. 
 Thy kingdom come, thy will be done... 
 (GRUNTING) 
 ...on earth as it is in heaven. 
 Give us this day our daily bread, and forgive us our trespasses as we forgive those who trespass against us! 
 For thine is the kingdom, the power, and the glory, forever and ever! 
 Amen!

 What else you got in there? Yeah. 
 Some chicken bones, some snakes for us to handle? 
 Praise the baby Jesus. I am saved. 
 All right, all right, all right, come on. 
 Our work here is done. 
 What? 
 Wait. 
 Already? What do you mean? 
 Use your intuition, Kyle. 
 Read the signs. 
 Is that what Josh was like? 
 Or your mother? Your wife? 
 No, but you said demons could be as different as the souls they possess. 
 Yes, they can. Yes, they can. 
 But some souls are capable of creating evil without the devil's help. 
 Let me try. 
 Why? 
 We're supposed to be fighting demons two by two, isn't that right? 
 That's what the Bible says, anyway. 
 
 
 
 Do you know me? 
 Maybe. 
 How? We've never met.

 It's not my fault. She just keeps bumping into me. 
 Just... um... you know, don't let her cross your orbit. 
 I tried, but she goes wherever I want to be.

 Why do you call me that? 
 You really don't know? 
 You have a lot of friends when you were a kid? 
 What? 
 At school. 
 Neighborhood kids, they like to hang out at your house? 
 I didn't think so. So, it was just you and... 
 Mom? Or Dad? 
 But somebody bailed early, right? 
 Maybe before you remember. 
 What about after? You seem like a good guy. 
 Plenty of work pals, drinking buddies, But then, eventually... everybody gets uncomfortable around you, start making excuses, drifting away. 
 Makes you feel cast out. 
 This is pointless.

 No.

 The ones who were close to you, maybe shared a bed.
