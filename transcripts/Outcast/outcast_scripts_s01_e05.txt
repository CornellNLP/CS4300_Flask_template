 Anderson : (SIGHS) 
 This is the stupidest damn idea ever. 
 Has Allison done anything to make you think she might still be possessed? 
 How many years was it Mildred was coming to your sermons before you knew the truth? 
 Mildred... was a special case. 
 Look, we know that people can walk and talk and act normal, and still have one of those things inside of 'em. 
 My daughter's in that house, Rev. 
 I've got to know for sure. 
 You put one foot on that property... she can have your ass thrown in jail. 
 Whether she still loves you, that's not the question. 
 What it comes down to is, "Does she trust you?" 
 Let me talk to her. 
 I can look for signs of possession. 
 But Mildred. 
 I mean, she was right under your nose. She didn't show any signs. 
 I don't know what happened with her. Maybe I didn't stay with it for long enough, but every other exorcism worked just as well as it did with little Joshua. 
 And I can prove it. 
 Okay.

 Dammit. 
 Hey, what's up? 
 I have to see Allison, and I need you to set it up. 
 You've lost your mind. 
 Kyle : I need to talk to her. In person. 
 Why? 
 Because I need to know that they're all right, Megan. 
 Megan : Of course, they're not all right. 
 After what happened? 
 What do you think, it's all rainbows and unicorns over there? 
 Megan. 
 Look, she's f*cked up, and you trying to see her now is gonna f*ck her up even more. 
 Look, I'll go check on her. 
 Make sure she knows she's got some support. 
 All right? 
 Okay, fine, but Megan... 
 Will you make sure that she seems... like her? 
 What does that mean? 
 I gotta go. 
 I'll talk to you later.

 Why don't you mess with your own guys? 
 Don't you think I don't. 
 You got any more of those? 
 Sorry, last one. 
 Asshole. 
 Hey. You're not wearing your watch. 
 It's at the jeweler getting the clasp fixed. 
 I heard about that fire out at Lowell's place. 
 Any idea what started it? 
 Never came back with anything conclusive. 
 No damage done, who gives a sh1t? 
 If it was deliberate, I give a sh1t. 
 I need a why and a who. 
 Punks. 
 Punks? 
 You know, teenage variety. 
 They see something, they want to break it, burn it, or f*ck it. 
 Case closed, you're welcome. 
 I suppose you're right. 
 You come over here to ask me about some brush fire? 
 That was just an excuse.

 I missed my breakfast.

 Ah! 
 Don't burn yourself.

 No, I did not.

 How are you? 
 What are you doing all the way out here? 
 Uh, this is a friend of mine. 
 Kyle Barnes. 
 Hey, Kyle. 
 Pleased to meet you. 
 We were in the area, and I just wanted to check in with you guys. 
 Make sure that Sherry's still doing okay. 
 No, it's fine. Kyle here, he had a similar experience. 
 So, how is Sherry? 
 She must have started college now, right? 
 I wish I could tell you that for sure. 
 She hasn't been home in some time. 
 Living in Charleston now. 
 Well, they all have to leave the nest eventually, if you're lucky. 
 It's not like that. 
 She, uh... she's on the streets. 
 Haven't seen or heard from her in months. 
 What happened? 
 Father's job is to protect his family. 
 When he fails at that... 
 Kyle : Your daughter... 
 Before she ran off, she ever show any signs that... the demon might still be inside of her? 
 No. Not after the reverend did his thing. 
 But did it... You're sure it worked? 
 We drove the demon from Sherry. 
 She's not even here. How do you know that? 
 Are you saying she may still be afflicted? 
 That's why she's on the streets? 
 Well, that's... 
 Kyle here, he's just... speculating. 
 Right? 
 Are you happy? 
 Hmm? 
 That man lost his daughter to the streets. 
 How would you feel if it was your Amber we were talking about? 
 I'd want to know the truth. That's how I'd feel. 
 I'd want to know if my daughter was still possessed or not. 
 You know, the whole point of this whole thing is for you to show me that your exorcisms have worked. 
 I'm still waiting to see that. 
 Apologize for being such an inconsiderate prick back there. 
 Are you f*cking kidding me? 
 I'm doing this for your benefit, not mine! 
 Sorry. 
 Hey. 
 Hey. 
 What are you doing here? 
 I was not even remotely in the neighborhood, so thought I'd stop by. 
 That was him last night, wasn't it? 
 Outside in the car? 
 I don't know what you're talking about. 
 He just sat out on the street watching the house. 
 Kyle? Okay, I had no idea about that. 
 If it's true, then I'll give him hell for it. 
 But you really want to know why I came all this way? 
 'Cause I'm worried about you. 
 I miss you. 
 You want to come inside? 
 Yeah. 
 Yeah. Okay. 
 The princess thing is getting a little old. 
 Time for something new. 
 What do you think, dinosaurs? 
 How's Amber feel about that? 
 She's seven. She doesn't get to decide everything. 
 You said I needed to set boundaries for her. 
 Well, yeah. 
 But she's had a lot of change in her life. 
 Maybe some things should stay the same? 
 Heh. 
 Nothing is the same. 
 I didn't have to lock the doors at night or panic every time I heard a dog bark or a car in the street. 
 If Amber acted up, Kyle could handle it. 
 He was always the calm one. 
 This might sound crazy, but would it help if you and Kyle talked? 
 No. I could be there, and Mark, too, if you wanted. No. 
 Just for Amber's sake. 
 (EMPHATICALLY) No. 
 Okay.

 Wait, fragile? What do you mean, fragile? How is she acting? 
 It might be the meds she's on, but something's not right. 
 Look, I'm gonna make some calls. I wanna make sure she's not self-medicating, but you stay away from her. You hear me?
