 What about the rest? 
 I'll come back after work. 
 Well... I'm on call, so... 
 I'll let myself in. 
 I'm sorry. 
 OK. 
 Doctor? 
 I'm having a wee, for God's sake! 
 Please don't raise your voice to me. 
 I'll be right out. 
 Cow. 
 I heard that and I'm writing an incident form. 
 Oh, sod it! 
 Doctor? 
 Dr Walker! 
 Doctor? 
 Dr Walker? 
 Ruby. Everyone calls me Ruby. 
 I'm AJ. Nice to meet you. 
 Please. My car is over here. 
 So it's your first time in India? 
 Sorry? 
 Well, most people get dragged back for a wedding or two. 
 You know distant cousins they didn't even know. 
 No cousins. At least, I don't think so. 
 I just needed to get away. 
 From everything. 
 Well, you've come to the right place. 
 Whoa! 
 Oh! 
 Does everyone drive like that? 
 Not everyone. 
 Probably Hindus. We're fatalists. If it's our day to die... 
 Where are you taking me? 
 What? 
 Where are we? 
 I think there's been a mistake. 
 This is the wrong place. 
 What do you mean? 
 This is where I'm meant to be. Dhoni Clinic. 
 No. I was definitely told to bring you here. 
 And where is here, exactly? 
 Well, it's er... Dr Fonseca's Good Karma Hospital. 
 Come on. 
 This Dr Fonseca. He's in charge? 
 Er... officially, no. 
 Unofficially, definitely yes. 
 Oh, and er... he's a she. 
 So maybe she can explain what's going on. 
 Where do I find her? 
 Just follow the screaming. 
 Excuse me, can I help you? 
 It's only a dislocated shoulder. 
 I'm in agony here. 
 I'm running a public hospital with no money. 
 We all have problems. 
 What are you doing? 
 Helping you. 
 You should give me morphine. 
 Girlfriend? 
 Yeah, yeah. We're engaged. 
 Do you think a woman like that wants to give her body to a man who screams because his shoulder joint is a few inches out? 
 Are you calling me a wimp? 
 Remember. 
 A real woman needs a man who can take a little pain. 
 And ride a moped. 
 You're late. 
 How did you do that? 
 Cunningham technique. 
 Massaging the bicep muscle reduces the spasm and allows the dislocation to reduce spontaneously. 
 No anaesthetic required unless you're a total wimp. 
 Also cheap, efficient and effective. 
 I'll teach you on the next idiot who falls off his scooter. 
 Straight ahead. 
 In this hospital, we use knowledge and skill, not fancy tests and expensive drugs. 
 You'll have to learn that if you want to work here. 
 Sorry, Doctor Fonseca. 
 I'll be honest with you, Dr Walker. 
 The last thing my hospital needs is a lazy British doctor with no experience and an attitude problem. 
 I don't have -- 
 This is real life, not a gap-year experience. 
 My patients are not dinner party stories. 
 Frankly, that's quite insulting. And it's not why I'm here. 
 Then why are you here? 
 It's complicated. 
 Naturally. But is it original? Or interesting? 
 No. 
 Pity. 
 The point is, I'm not supposed to be here. 
 This is the wrong hospital. I applied for the Dhoni Clinic. 
 As did everyone else but the rules changed. 
 For some reason, all our new graduates prefer to stay on the teat rather than spread their tiny wings in the real world. 
 So now all new doctors must spend a compulsory year at a public hospital, no exceptions. 
 So I'm stuck here for a year? 
 You say that like it's a bad thing, Dr Walker. This way. 
 Good morning. 
 Morning. 
 This is Dr Walker. 
 Another half-trained British doctor to practise on Indian people. 
 Don't be racist, Lydia. 
 Dr Nair, our nominal chief and the human raincloud in the corner is Dr Varma. 
 I believe you've already met my son, AJ, our ambulance driver. 
 You didn't have to... 
 No problem at all. 
 Milk, sugar? Or both? 
 Oh, both, please. 
 You'll soon come to the conclusion that I make the best tea and the wisest decisions around here. 
 I believe your previous post was paediatrics? 
 Yes, that's right. 
 I thought we were getting another surgeon. 
 What happened to Dr Pradeep? 
 Recruited elsewhere. We get what we're given. 
 I'm sure Dr Walker is a willing student. You can teach her. 
 I'm not really a surgeon. 
 Simple butchery with a little light needlework thrown in. 
 Round here we turn our hands to most things. 
 Right, housekeeping. We're almost out of amoxicillin. 
 So I catch anyone giving it for a viral throat, they'll need emergency surgery themselves. 
 They're still reporting cholera east of Munnar. 
 15 new cases, so eyes open, please. 
 I don't want it here. 
 And that's it. Welcome to the Good Karma Hospital. 
 Yeah... No, well... 
 Can you just double check, because... 
 No, no, I understand that, the point is that... 
 No, no, no, don't put me on hold. 
 That's all very well but... 
 Can I at least just talk to her? 
 Because this isn't what I signed up for. 
 Hello? 
 Sorry. 
 Whatever it is, we deal with it surgery, medical, dental. 
 I'm not a dentist. 
 It's easier than it looks. Just ask Mari for the pliers. 
 Well, at least we're not too busy. 
 I suppose we've only just opened. 
 What, this? This isn't the waiting room. 
 This is just admissions. 
 Come. 
 This is the waiting room. 
 Soon I shall be a man. Then we can marry. 
 What makes you think I'll say yes? 
 I'm very charming. And once I'm rich, you will no longer have to work in a terrible place like this. 
 Unless you're promised to another? 
 No. Right now, I'm all yours. 
 Sorry. Did that hurt? 
 Of course not. 
 Your friend? 
 Brother. Sanjay. He's just a kid. 
 You still haven't told me who did this to you. 
 A jealous husband caught me making love to his wife. 
 But now I have found you, I promise to never even look at another woman as long as I live. 
 Just promise me you'll be more careful next time. 
 Yes, I will. 
 OK. 
 She's barely out of medical school. 
 Beggars can't be choosers. She seems keen enough. 
 Well, I can't supervise her. Also I'm on call today. 
 I'm sure you'll manage. 
 Think of her as the childhood hamster you never had, fragile and easily crushed. It'll be good for you. 
 Our patients deserve better. 
 I couldn't agree more. 
 But in life, few of us get what we deserve. 
 Help her rise to the challenge, Dr Varma. 
 You had a serious head injury. 
 You can't be alone tonight. 
 I have Sanjay. 
 I meant a responsible adult. 
 Then I should stay at your place tonight? 
 Nice try. No. 
 Dinner, then? 
 You never give up, do you? 
 How can I? I'm in love. 
 Until the day I die. 
 Which might be sooner than you think. 
 Come on. Out. Out. Come on. 
 I could have handled him. He's only a kid. 
 A kid who'll sell drugs to anyone who'll buy them. 
 Why do you think they beat him up? 
 Doctor! Doctor! My wife requires your attention. 
 Come here. Straight ahead. 
 You can relax, yeah? 
 Doctor. 
 Now I assume you have delivered a baby before? 
 Sure. I mean, it's been a few years since I did it myself, and I was supervised, obviously, but I think... 
 She's only at three centimetres. So it'll be a while yet. 
 Check every hour. Call me when she's at ten. 
 Doctor? 
 Yes? 
 Are you quite sure that everything is all right? 
 Your wife is in perfect health. 
 Everything points to a normal, uncomplicated delivery, yeah? 
 So I'll call you when it's time and you'll come back? 
 Was that a yes or a... 
 So... I'm Dr Walker. 
 I'll be looking after you from now on. 
 You're English? 
 Fresh off the boat. It's my first day. 
 Oh, but don't worry. Not a problem. 
 We have babies in England too. 
 So have you got a name worked out? 
 Or is it wait and see? 
 Raja, after his father. Our first boy. 
 Well, I can't wait to meet him. 
 How long have you known me? 
 I don't like surprises and I have work to do. 
 So this better be good. 
 Trust me, Lydia, I'm convinced that this could be the perfect answer for our long-standing financial worries. 
 I'm... I'm sure you will thank me later. 
 Dr Fonseca. 
 Your timing, like your bedside manner, is faultless. 
 What are you up to? 
 Your lack of trust hurts me, Lydia. 
 This way. 
 Under this humble tarpaulin is a ground-breaking example of medicine and business working together in perfect harmony. 
 Just show me. 
 I am a doctor! I run a hospital! 
 How can I advertise a bar? 
 Especially one owned by a petty criminal! 
 I resent that slander and demand a retraction. 
 You have used my face without permission. That's slander. 
 I'm sorry. I should have listened to Ram. 
 He said you looked jowly and I ignored him. 
 Greg! 
 You! I blame you for this. 
 Wait. Wait. 
 Greg has agreed to sponsor the ambulance. 
 The fuel, the repairs... 
 Tyres. 
 Yes, the tyres. 
 And in return, all he requires is a little bit of publicity. 
 People round here trust you. You're a brand, Lydia. 
 No photo, no deal. 
 No. 
 No. 1,000 times, no. 
 And that's your final word? 
 Believe me, neither of you want to hear my final word. 
 Well, that went well. 
 Is everything all right? 
 The baby's about to crown. You're progressing quickly. 
 Mari, can you go and fetch Dr Varma, quickly? 
 Doctor? 
 OK, Nita. 
 Just let me know when you're ready to push, OK? 
 That works. 
 You have a reservation? 
 I'm the doctor. 
 Oh, yes. Of course, please. 
 Mum, don't try and get up. You're better lying down. 
 And I'm telling you, I'm fine. 
 For God's sake, Maggie, just lie down. 
 Look, here's the doctor. 
 In the middle of the ceremony, she just collapsed. 
 We called immediately. 
 There's no hotel doctor? 
 He's sick. Food poisoning. 
 It's fine. 
 We were almost done and dusted, anyway. 
 Besides, we're in India. Where's he gonna run off to? 
 Before you say anything, I fainted. 
 We don't get heat like this in Stourbridge. 
 And now I'm being killed by fuss. 
 I'm Dr Varma. I need to examine you. 
 I promise it won't take long. 
 Good. We're paying for that bleeding elephant by the hour. 
 Dad! 
 Dr Varma is out on call.I  can't find anyone. 
 What do you mean? There has to be someone. 
 No-one. 
 OK. 
 OK. We're fine. 
 Really, really fine. 
 What are you doing? 
 The baby is coming. You need to be prepared. 
 OK, Nita. 
 You're going to feel another contraction any second. 
 When it comes, I need you to push for me, OK? 
 Now! Push! Push! 
 Come on! 
 What's the matter? 
 Everything's fine. 
 It concerns me that you keep saying that. 
 Now is the time to fetch the real doctor, Dr Varma. 
 I'm a real doctor. 
 With great respect, I would prefer someone else in charge. 
 Dr Varma -- 
 Isn't here. So you've got me. 
 sh1t. 
 
 
 
 I can see the cord. 
 The cord's prolapsing. 
 What are you doing? 
 The baby's head is pressing on the umbilical cord. 
 I need to support the head or the baby will suffocate. 
 Another contraction? Now listen to me. 
 This baby needs to come out this time. 
 OK, no more messing around. 
 I understand. 
 Ready? 
 Push! Now! Push! 
 Push! Don't you dare stop! Keep pushing! 
 Push! Push! Push! 
 OK. 
 And here we are. 
 Doctor? 
 You have a girl. You have a beautiful baby girl. 
 You performed the ultrasound scan. 
 You told me my wife was carrying a son. 
 Is that true? You know the law as well as I do. 
 There were medical concerns. Foetal movements reduced. 
 Even so... 
 You lied! 
 You knew if the baby had been a girl, we'd have... 
 You would have what? 
 You understand me, Dr Nair. I already have three daughters. 
 All need to be married. 
 I'm not a rich man. 
 It is hard enough for me to provide for the children I have. 
 It's a healthy baby, Mr Mehta. 
 A gift from Krishna himself, surely? 
 It's quite simple. 
 Nita Mehta was bleeding profusely and needed an ultrasound scan. 
 Her husband wanted to know the s*x and I refused. 
 And then he as good as told me that unless he found out, they'd have an abortion because he couldn't risk another girl. 
 So you told him the s*x -- 
 I was manipulated -- 
 Which is illegal. 
 He thought he could see an appendage. 
 And you didn't correct him? 
 Do you know how small a pen1s is at 12 weeks? 
 You've put the hospital at risk. 
 Do you think we can afford legal action over this? 
 The Government could close us down! 
 And rightly so! 
 Now, has this happened before? 
 What, fainting? Never. 
 Like I said, must be this heat. 
 No, I don't think so. Erm... 
 I'm afraid I suspect you've had a seizure. 
 An epileptic fit. 
 Now if this is the first time it's happened, we'll have to take you to hospital for further tests. 
 There's no need... and no time. 
 I have a brain tumour. 
 I can't believe he walked out on his baby like that. 
 Family planning is a big deal round here. 
 Any child is a blessing. 
 Back home, people try for years, pay thousands for IVF. 
 And there's thousands of rupees worth of dowry playing over there. 
 Raja Mehta runs his own business. Taxi firm. 
 He works every hour God sends to provide for his family. 
 No benefits. No help. 
 He needed a son. 
 Sometimes good men get desperate. 
 Mari told me what happened. 
 You were left on your own and you saved that baby's life. 
 Well done. 
 But although I appreciate an independent spirit, Dr Varma should have assisted you. 
 I think he was called away. 
 Important business, no doubt. 
 Our daughter's wedding. 
 It should be the proudest day of his life. 
 How could I tell him? 
 Nobody knows? 
 Anti-convulsants. 
 They should prevent any further seizures. 
 I'm sure you simply fainted. 
 The midday sun can be fierce. 
 Perhaps some kind of hat? 
 Thank you. 
 If I were your husband, I'd want to know. 
 If you were my husband, we wouldn't be talking. 
 So when do the shifts swap? 
 They don't. 
 So when do I finish? 
 Whenever you like, as long as the board is empty. 
 I don't get it. 
 No-one leaves until the board is empty. Are you up to it? 
 Take a seat, please. 
 Herr Muller? 
 If you'd like to follow me. 
 Hey. 
 Ssh, ssh. 
 She's so beautiful. Then I suppose all babies are. 
 Even the ugly ones... 
 Not that your baby is ugly. 
 I mean... You know what I mean. 
 All babies are born beautiful. 
 Not all are born equal. 
 Hey... Sssh. 
 Doctor? 
 Has she been feeding OK? She's a little pale. 
 There's a VSD. 
 Pulmonary valve is severely stenosed. 
 She has Fallot's Tetralogy. 
 Your baby has a severe congenital heart defect. 
 The attacks come and go but she'll need specialist help soon. 
 And if not? 
 Then your baby will die. 
 Perhaps, if that's God's will, then... 
 I will speak to my husband. He'll know what to do. 
 I know it's a tragedy but if they refuse permission, then there's little else we can do. 
 But if it was a boy -- 
 The cost will still ruin them. 
 You did your best. Sometimes that's all any of us can manage. 
 We can't just accept it. 
 Believe me, Dr Walker, I'm a huge fan of conflict, but a wise general only fights when she's sure to win the day. 
 We wait for our opportunity. 
 The real trick is to know it when you see it. 
 Come on, then! 
 Or are you gonna sleep here all night? 
 Right, here we are. 
 This is the hospital accommodation? 
 I know. Quite disgusting.I  can only apologise. 
 There's a fridge in the kitchen stocked with bare essentials. 
 Thanks. 
 You travel light, Dr Walker. 
 Nothing else wanted to come with me. 
 More fool them. 
 You haven't thought about him all day, have you? 
 How did you know? 
 There's always a man, in my experience. 
 Neither interesting nor original. 
 I've got something to tell you. 
 At last. I thought you were never coming home. 
 Yeah, well, my patients needed me. 
 Dr Fonseca, you are truly indispensable. 
 I've decided I want my key back. 
 Don't let a silly little sponsored ambulance come between us. 
 Firstly, there is no "us". 
 This is merely a mutually beneficial arrangement. 
 Which I am currently reconsidering. 
 So, shoo! 
 OK. 
 What do you want? 
 Dignity. 
 Trumped by hard cash every time. 
 No picture. 
 There is literally no amount of money you can pay me to make me change my mind. 
 I need my brand. 
 Then I will need my bed back. 
 Immediately. 
 So, if I agree... our mutually beneficial arrangement... 
 Can be renegotiated in good faith. 
 Immediately? 
 I don't see why not. 
 In that case, Dr Fonseca, you've got yourself a deal. 
 Let me through, I'm a doctor! Let me through! 
 Oh, no. 
 Atul, can you hear me? Come on. 
 Atul. 
 Sanjay? 
 OK, just hold it down. Hold it down over his cuts. 
 Come on, come on. Come on, come on. 
 Someone call an ambulance now! What are you waiting for?! 
 Sanjay? 
 He's OK. 
 I told you... I'd see you again. 
 They're both unstable. They need theatre now. 
 We only have one operating theatre. 
 Which one? Who goes first? 
 I don't know. 
 What do you want to do, Doctor? Come on! 
 Sanjay. Take Sanjay first, his wounds are more severe. 
 He's been attacked. Stab wounds to the abdomen. 
 Oh, God preserve us. 
 And the other one? 
 His brother, Atul. 
 Multiple stab wounds to the abdomen. He's holding BP at 80. 
 Dr Varma's on his way. Make the boy as stable as you can. 
 OK. 
 More IV. 
 Damn. He's too shut down. I need another. 
 I can't find a vein. 
 16-year-old male, stab wound to abdomen. Completely shut down. 
 Cut down set, now. 
 If you can't get access, you do a cut down... I/O. 
 Large bore cannula. Spencer Wells. 
 No. No, O negative. He needs blood, not saline. Quick! 
 Come on, Dr Walker. 
 He's clotting up rather more easily now. 
 Still asystole. 
 Doctor... 
 Dr Walker. 
 Adequate IV access. 
 Rapid volume replacement and high-flow oxygen. 
 I'm sorry. 
 O negative should have been running immediately. 
 He was too shut down. 
 A real surgeon can deal with that. 
 A cut down, I/O access -- 
 That's enough. 
 You told me to teach her. 
 I said, that's enough. 
 You know, just have your holiday if you want. 
 Just don't get in the way of the real doctors. 
 OK? 
 I've just checked Sanjay Nadar. 
 Drains are running clear already. He should do well. 
 The police have been informed. 
 His brother's body has been released to the coroner. 
 We did the best we could in a very difficult situation. 
 All of us. 
 Right. I think that's enough. 
 You all know what you have to do. 
 Horrible beasts! 
 Know how many pathogens there are on a single monkey hair? 
 Er... no. 
 Tens of millions... probably. 
 So, what? 
 Sorry? 
 You're sitting here alone. Your bag is packed. 
 There must be a so. 
 So... I don't think I can do this. 
 And what is this, exactly? 
 Leaving England, thinking I could work here and... 
 Just the whole being a doctor thing. 
 Oh, I see. Then that is a problem. 
 Would it help to throw a stone at a monkey? 
 You're laughing at me. 
 Suit yourself. 
 A young boy lost his life and we couldn't save him. 
 We, not you. 
 Dr Varma -- 
 His injuries were too severe. 
 There was nothing you, Dr Varma or Ganesh himself could have done. 
 Then why didn't it feel that way? 
 Because you, unlike Dr Varma, are still a fully-functioning human being. 
 When you lose that feeling, it really is time to go home. 
 People come to India to find themselves, Dr Walker. 
 The truth is, most of them are simply idiots. 
 But you... You do look a little lost. 
 But something tells me there's someone in there worth discovering. 
 And as for being a good doctor, you might not be the best but you're the best I've got. So I'm not letting you leave. 
 I'm not sure resigning works that way. 
 Sometimes we all just... overcomplicate things. 
 Especially when we're too emotional. 
 I don't think Dr Varma wants me back. 
 Ha! Oh, believe me, he needs you much more than you need him. 
 Now get back to work. 
 Oh, and if you ever miss morning report again, consider yourself fired. 
 And if we don't have the operation? 
 Then your child will remain very sick. 
 Things could only get worse. She needs this surgery. 
 Of course, the choice is yours. 
 Dr Walker? 
 The wisdom of Solomon, Dr Walker. I'm impressed. 
 Sometimes, old stories are the best. 
 Thank you. 
 She has a name now. Ruby. 
 I asked Dr Fonseca. 
 Don't get too cocky. 
 There are 17 Lydias from here to Kochi. 
 And four of them are boys. 
 Come along, Dr Walker. We have work to do.
