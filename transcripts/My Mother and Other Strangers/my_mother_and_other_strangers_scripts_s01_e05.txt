 Older Francis : I saw a thing about Bing Crosby the other night on one of those documentary channels. 
 It recounted how his version of Jingle Bells, recorded in 1943 with the Andrew Sisters, sold a million copies, and it brought memories flooding back, some that only make sense to me now, of the first time I heard it, on the rain-swept aerodrome in Moybeg at Christmas 1943, a Christmas I will remember as long as I live. 
 [PLANE ENGINES RUMBLE] 
 Francis, that's your sandwich. Put it in your schoolbag. 
 Mum. Mum, where were you? 
 I went for a walk. 
 You must be freezing, Mrs Coyne. Would you like a cup of tea? 
 No, thank you, Sally. I've made myself late. 
 And why aren't you two off to school? 
 It's really cold and it's the last day. Can we not stay? 
 It's character forming. 
 And there's a surprise. 
 At school? Is it sweets? 
 It's a surprise. Not sweets. 
 Now go. 
 Mr Coyne. 
 I have the ring ready. I made it a size smaller. 
 Would you believe my wife and yours have the same size finger? 
 I took the liberty of letting her try it on. 
 I hope you don't mind. 
 And did she approve? 
 She did, Michael. 
 She loves a romantic tale. I have a nice box for it here. 
 No, no, you take it home with you. Let her try it on, just in case. 
 How will you give it to her? 
 The traditional way? Down on one knee? 
 I might not be able to get up if I did that, Malachy. 
 The old joints creak a bit these days. 
 I'm sure I'll manage to find a moment that's right. 
 Michael Coyne? 
 I'm, erm, heading out your way. To see Kettie and the cub. 
 And the new daughter. 
 If she's mine, huh? 
 Well, I'm sure Kettie will be rightly pleased. 
 Today? I could give you a lift. No, no, not today. 
 Closer to Christmas, Michael. 
 I have some shopping to do first. 
 Something for Seamie, some catchpenny. 
 You... you couldn't lend us ten bob, could you, Michael? 
 I'll pay it back on Boxing Day. 
 I'll see if I have it. 
 Thanks, Michael. 
 Boxing Day. 
 Oh, aye. 
 Boxing Day. 
 [ENGINE STARTS UP] 
 [KNOCK ON DOOR] 
 Come in, Master Corey. 
 Come on... One at a time. 
 Quiet. Everyone, please. Quiet. 
 Master Corey... has an announcement to make. 
 You have all been invited to a Christmas party. 
 [CHEERING] 
 Quiet! Quiet! 
 It's tomorrow, it's on the aerodrome and there might be sweets. 
 Now, I have a slip of paper here for each of you to give to your mother when you get home. Arrangements and so on. 
 Now, it's all written down, it's all on here. 
 Now, you boys, there'll be toilets there and I want you to use them. 
 This is Moybeg on view here. So I want manners, manners, manners. 
 When you answer, it's yes...? 
 All : - Sir! 
 And yes...? 
 All : Ma'am. 
 And when you greet someone, it's...? 
 Hi, ye blade, ye. 
 [LAUGHTER] 
 Seamus Brady! 
 It's "Hello, sir", "Hello, madam". 
 Now, they've gone to a great deal of trouble for us down on the aerodrome. 
 They're rolling out the red carpet for us. 
 So we want you all in the good clothes. 
 Tell your mother, mind. Who believes in Santa Claus? 
 Well, we'll see about that when you meet him. 
 Santa is going to be there in person. He will. 
 Just you wait and see. 
 Go on now. 
 Off with you. 
 Boys! Boys! Single file. Go. 
 No, actually, back, back. 
 Girls first. 
 You can take your drawings if you want. 
 I seen the doctor's car. You SAW. 
 Don't be so snottery, Emma. 
 I saw the doctor's car on the road yesterday. 
 No sign of that son of his. 
 He's probably swotting. 
 I suppose he reads nothing but books. 
 Not sure what else he'd read, Barney. 
 Help me with this, will you? 
 He looks right stuck up in any way. 
 He's not a bit stuck up, as it happens. 
 That's what you think, Emma. 
 But it's bred into them boys, them doctors' sons. 
 Well, that's good advice, Barney. 
 I'll be watching him like a hawk for incipient snobbery. 
 This fella, Dreyfuss, he seems to be a man with good ideas about the parish. A thinker. 
 I have no idea what he thinks. 
 I've been dealing with Lieutenant Zeigler. 
 The nurse? That minded poor Maisie? 
 The same. 
 Ah, she's very pretty now, I have to say. Vivacious. 
 She's like Peggy Lee, do you think? 
 If Peggy Lee is a proper bossy boots, then she's definitely like Peggy Lee. 
 Ah, come on, now, you can't grumble about someone who is willing to organise a Christmas party, all the same. 
 I'm willing to try, Jack. 
 Will you lock up? 
 Father Nolan's coming for the keys. 
 See you on the big night. 
 I was driving past the perimeter track... 
 Mrs Coyne. I heard music blaring out over the loudspeakers. 
 I hope they're not going to be playing that. 
 That was Jingle Bells, I think. 
 Silent Night would be better. 
 Or a nice Irish song. She Lived Beside The Anner. 
 It's not about Christmas as such, but much more suitable for young minds. 
 I'll ask if they have She Lived Beside the Anner in their record collection, Father. 
 Meantime, I'd better be off. 
 Or The Holy City. 
 John McCormack does that lovely. 
 [HENS CLUCK] 
 You were right about the surprise, Mummy. Here. 
 I have one, too. 
 Christmas week, that's right and good. 
 How did you know about the surprise, Kettie? 
 Eh? 
 Seamie said you told him. 
 Seamie, show Francis the thing you found. He'll know what it is. Go on. 
 Aye. Come to the room. 
 What's this? 
 I don't know. 
 You got all this stuff from the dump? 
 Aye. 
 Look at this. 
 Well, young Francis? 
 It's a baseball glove. 
 They call it a mitt. 
 Bagful of brains, you are. 
 You could show it to your daddy, if he came home. 
 What put that idea into your mind? 
 People come home for Christmas. 
 Full of brains. Eh? 
 How was the town? 
 Quiet... for Christmas week. 
 The country's broke, I suppose. 
 I saw Martin Brady. 
 Kettie's Martin? The same. 
 Does Kettie know he's about? 
 I think so. 
 He touched me for ten bob. 
 Said he was going to buy a present for Seamie. 
 Then he headed straight into the Red Hand. 
 Do you think Kettie will be happy to see him? 
 Maybe. For Seamie's sake. 
 But he's a dead loss, Rose. 
 She knows that. 
 Well... 
 I'd better take over in the pub. 
 Dad, can we go now? 
 Barney and I have exhausted the works of Emily Bronte as a topic for discussion. 
 You may. 
 Any customers? 
 Jemmy Fox, two stouts. 
 Did he pay? 
 Yes! 
 There's a nuance. 
 And the post arrived. 
 Shoreham, that has to be Vera, and these for you. 
 Right, Ulster Pig, Christmas edition. 
 Poultry Journal. 
 Into the fire. 
 What's this? 
 Thanks for coming, James. 
 Would you take a half 'un? 
 I won't, Michael. 
 Let's get on with this, if you don't mind. 
 I have here the, er, the letter from Vincent Coyne's solicitor. 
 Vincent Coyne's your cousin, right? 
 On my father's side. 
 And the licence on this premises is in his name? Above the door. 
 And why is the licence in the name of your cousin? 
 30 years ago, James, my mother... 
 Bella? 
 I remember her well. God rest her, she was a great woman. 
 Well, she applied for the job of teacher here. 
 Father Ryan, the parish priest at the time, was a crabbed old woman-hater as well as being a closet drunk. 
 Now, he wouldn't hear of any woman teaching in his school who was connected with the liquor trade. 
 So my father asked my uncle Edward to hold the licence for him. 
 Edward was in poor health. 
 Vincent, my cousin, was 22, pious, trustworthy, we thought. 
 So, pious, trustworthy Vincent Coyne wants you to buy back the licence? 
 For more than this building is worth, James. 
 Can Andrew come? 
 No... 
 It's for children and teachers. No grown-ups. 
 I'm not a child. Mum, are you serious? 
 You're coming as a teacher's assistant, Emma. 
 And Andrew isn't invited. 
 He should be. 
 He's a doctor. Nearly a doctor. 
 And? 
 There'll be nosebleeds and general hysteria. 
 He'll be needed. 
 The place is teeming with real doctors. No! 
 And besides, is he even home? 
 SHE SIGHS The thing is, James, that figure he's asking for... 
 I don't have it. 
 Or anything like it. 
 Well, that's pub licences for you. 
 Would Tomkins lend it to you down at the bank? 
 No. 
 You know how much debt my father handed down to me. 
 And the aerodrome came along just in time to save my bacon. 
 How in hell did Vincent Coyne manage to run the best wee drapery in the country into the ground? 
 The answer's all around you, Michael. On the shelves. 
 Be thankful you didn't inherit the Coyne gene. 
 So, what do we do next? 
 Solicitor's letter back to him? 
 I don't think that would be wise. 
 We've no actual legal case, Michael. 
 You're going to have to appeal to his sense of decency. 
 Decency? 
 He's trying to take my livelihood away. 
 Still, you'll have to talk to him. Change his mind. 
 A solicitor's letter from me will just harden it up. 
 So, what? 
 Ask him to meet you here. I'll collect him. 
 He lives in Hilltown, not five miles away from me. 
 Yeah, I thought you said no solicitors? No solicitor's letter. 
 I'll be giving him a lift as a friend of you both. 
 I'll talk to him about the gee-gees. 
 [HE LAUGHS WEAKLY] 
 It wasn't the drink on the own that did it, Michael. 
 He likes the horses too. 
 Come on. 
 Let's phone him. Right now? 
 I see no pressing reason to keep her open. 
 Let's try and settle this while it's still the season of goodwill. 
 I know, Vincent. No, I'll get you a lift. 
 Yeah. 
 Before tea time, maybe four or five? 
 Yeah, James Harrington. 
 Yeah. 
 But he's got a car and he'll bring you. 
 No, it'll just be you and me. 
 I know. 
 Yeah, I know what you want. 
 We'll talk it through, Vincent. 
 All right? 
 The little blirt. Calm, Michael. 
 Whatever you do, don't lose the bap. 
 Right. 
 [VEHICLE PULLS UP] 
 [KNOCK ON DOOR] 
 Captain Dreyfuss. 
 It's an unexpected visit. What can I do for you? 
 Uh... 
 I wanted to discuss the arrangements for the party. 
 But if it's inconvenient... 
 I'm... working rather hard. Christmas stuff. 
 Oh. 
 Erm, perhaps I can come back later, then? 
 Of course. 
 If you wish. If it suits your busy schedule. 
 I've become quite used to dealing with Nurse Zeigler in the past few weeks, so if it doesn't suit you, that will be fine. 
 Mrs Coyne... 
 Rose... 
 Mrs Coyne will do perfectly well. So... 
 You idiot, Rose Coyne. 
 [VEHICLE PULLS AWAY] 
 [FOOTSTEPS AND DOOR CLOSES] 
 Mrs Coyne? 
 [KNOCK ON DOOR] 
 Oh, just a moment. 
 Come in. 
 I'm sorry, Mrs Coyne. 
 I was just coming in and I found this on the doorstep. 
 Thank you, Sally. Yes, it's, erm... 
 That'll be, erm, just stuff... 
 Instructions for the party on the aerodrome. 
 Thank you, Sally. 
 Scatty hens! 
 Why can't you lay in a proper nest, huh? 
 Hello. 
 Oh, gosh. 
 I'm collecting eggs and... 
 How did you get here? 
 I cycled. 
 Does Mum know you're here? 
 I knocked on the door, there was no reply, so I searched. 
 And here you are. 
 [THEY LAUGH NERVOUSLY] 
 I have shoes, normally, for my feet. 
 Why have you come? 
 I mean, I'm quite pleased to see you, but... 
 I'm... I'm doing a study on egg production on Ulster farms, for my PhD. 
 Oh. 
 Emma, I came to see you. 
 "Where you dwell among the peasants..." 
 I mean, "Among the untrodden ways." 
 That's Barney. 
 And he's not a peasant. He's very smart in his own way. 
 You're not a snob, are you? I'd hate it if you were a snob. 
 No, my chum Nicky, he's a terrific snob. I'm not. 
 No, look, look... 
 Hey. Hey, Barney. 
 Well, I tried. 
 You don't think he's jealous, do you? 
 This is a test. 
 A test? 
 Terrifically crucial. Mum doesn't approve. 
 Of me? 
 Of us. 
 Of us, is it? 
 Oh, you're very sure of yourself, Miss Emma Coyne. 
 All right, let's get this test over with. 
 You'd better come in. 
 Barney, I'm going inside! 
 [INDISTINCT SPEECH OUTSIDE] 
 Mum? 
 Mum! Mum? 
 I've... I've no idea where Mum's gone. 
 I suppose, erm, I should go on? 
 Ah! 
 [CHILD LAUGHS] 
 Go on. You'd better run! 
 [LAUGHTER] 
 Here, come back, you cheeky little scamp! 
 Here, you! Yankee boys. 
 What's this party craic? 
 We decided to do something nice for the kids. 
 Yeah, take their minds off this dump. 
 [LAUGHTER] 
 Tio, easy. 
 Yeah, we had a whip around. Got them some good stuff. 
 And you never thought of asking us? 
 Yeah, we did. And then we decided not to. 
 [LAUGHTER] 
 Well, I'm going anyhow. Asked or not. 
 You won't get in, Ned. 
 We'll see about that, Failey. 
 Maybe I'll see you boys up there. 
 All right, old-timer. 
 Michael, you're very quiet tonight. 
 I'm all right, Failey. 
 Ludo for Francis. 
 Doll for Kate, courtesy of Auntie Vera. 
 There's something for Emma too from that same giver. 
 Oh. 
 Sweet Auntie Vera. What is it? 
 Santa knows. 
 Mum! 
 Did Andrew bring you something? 
 Andrew? 
 How did you know he was here? Mum? 
 Were you snooping? 
 I wasn't snooping. 
 I saw you, that's all. 
 He came to see me. 
 That's better than any present. 
 Yes. 
 He seems like a nice boy. 
 Emma, you have to be careful. 
 Love is a funny thing. 
 [DOOR OPENS] 
 Michael. 
 You look wrung out, poor thing. 
 Tea? 
 Aye. 
 Rose... I need to talk to you. 
 About? 
 The pub. 
 You know the licence is held in my cousin Vincent's name? 
 Well, the doomsday thing has happened. 
 Vincent is broke. 
 And he wants me to buy it back. 
 Your own licence? 
 My licence... your licence and Emma's and Francis's and Kate's... 
 And can you? 
 Buy it back? 
 Well, why should I have to, Rose? 
 This is family, this is trust. 
 This is everything I believe in. 
 And it's been thrown in my face. 
 Michael. 
 I don't know what to say. 
 I can't bear to see you betrayed by... by someone you trust. 
 Oh, God, Michael. 
 Do you think that's stuff for the party? 
 What do you think's up there? 
 There's everything, Francis. 
 Everything. 
 Look at Steiger! 
 Ho-ho-ho! 
 Hey, guys, it's scary Santa! 
 Oh, you don't look scary, Mitch. 
 You look cuddly. 
 And you got a real Aladdin's cave waiting for you out there. 
 Well, good, because we're going to have ourselves 40 thieves - minimum. 
 I reckon I might finally get my hands on a few little reprobates I've only ever seen running away. 
 Now! 
 To my sleigh! 
 [THEY GIGGLE] 
 
 
 
 Michael. 
 Well? 
 I'm picking him up. A bit later than you asked, seven. 
 OK. 
 What I'll do, James, is I'll close the pub for an hour or so, bring Vincent over to the house. 
 Rose and them will be at the party. 
 That way I can talk to him. 
 The blirt. 
 How does your wife get along with Vincent Coyne? 
 Would it be better he talk to her? 
 I don't think that'd be a good idea. 
 Hmm, taken the news bad? 
 Bad or good, James, is beside the point. 
 It was me who brought her over to this place. 
 I can't let it fall down around her. 
 Higher! 
 [SHE SQUEALS] 
 [ENGINE APPROACHES] 
 Emma. 
 Barney? 
 Your man is here. 
 Huh? 
 It's the doctor's car. 
 Oh, gosh! Is Andrew here? 
 Emma. 
 Gosh. 
 Dad wanted me to get some fish, so I was passing and... 
 Francis, Kate, into the house and get ready. Seamie, home. 
 I be to go as well, then, eh? 
 Ow! Sorry! 
 You did that on purpose, you stupid bloody peasant! 
 He's not a peasant! 
 He's my friend! He reads and he knows a lot of things! 
 And I'm sorry you hurt your arm, and you are a snob! 
 Emma, I... 
 Who's the pheasant now, ye boy ye? 
 Emma, you shouldn't be coming, you're not at school. 
 Emma's going to be Mum's assistant. 
 What's a sistant? It means you better do what you're told. 
 Come on. We need to get going. 
 I don't want to go. 
 What's wrong? 
 Nothing. 
 Emma, what's wrong? 
 Andrew. I shouted at him. 
 He called Barney a bird's name. What was it, Francis? 
 A peasant. 
 Well, that's not right. 
 We're all peasants, Mum. 
 Barney is a peasant, but he's my peasant and Andrew had no right to say what he did, and I got so cross with him and he drove away and I'll probably never see him again. 
 You've a good moral compass, Emma. 
 I'm proud of you. 
 I don't want a moral compass, Mum. I want Andrew! 
 Michael. 
 When you have a minute. 
 With you now, Ned. 
 You having a wee whisky there, Michael? 
 I thought it didn't agree with you? 
 [EXCITED CHATTER] 
 Look at this. 
 Is that your one? 
 Here you are. 
 You'd better get going. You'll miss it! 
 That's the way to do it, boys. 
 I'd say there'll be craic up there, Failey. 
 Would you say there'll be drink? 
 I doubt it, Jimmy. It's full of scholars. 
 I'd say there'd be cake, but... 
 Cake, and maybe some Yankee whisky. 
 Well, boys, I'll give yous a full report when I get back. 
 You said you wouldn't. 
 You said you'd be sober... for once in your life. 
 Oh, come here. I'm fine. 
 You swore you'd be sober. 
 And you'd bring him a present. 
 Come here to me, Kettie. 
 No! 
 [BABY CRIES] 
 She'll service every bloody Yank in the country! 
 You won't come near your husband when he comes to visit you at Christmas? 
 Is that it, Kettie?! 
 Boys! Boys! 
 [CHATTER] 
 Boys! 
 [CHATTER CONTINUES] 
 Boys! 
 I have to close her for an hour. 
 [GROANS] 
 I have something that needs doing. 
 You going to thon party, Michael? 
 Meeting Ned at the bandstand? 
 Michael, you wouldn't shape at putting us out, would you? 
 This is our party here. 
 I have to, Failey. 
 Boys, look, I'll open her up again in an hour sharp. 
 That's a guarantee. Now, come on! 
 I'm taking that glass, Jimmy. 
 I know the fresh air will do you good, lads. 
 [EXCITED CHATTER] 
 [DANCE MUSIC PLAYS] 
 Listen to thon music. 
 Jitterbug! 
 I've got the jitters. 
 Martin. 
 One at a time! Yeah, come on! 
 Slowly! Slowly now, slowly. 
 Francis, come on! 
 Go get you some cake, come on! 
 Merry Christmas! 
 [PARTY BLOWER HONKS] 
 Wow. 
 Whoa. 
 [EXCITED CHATTER] 
 There you go, sugar! Here's a hat for you! 
 [HORN BLARES] 
 Ho-ho-ho! Merry Christmas! 
 [EXCITED CHATTER AND CHEERING] 
 There's so many of them! Hello, hello! 
 Have you been good for your mum and dad this year? 
 Hello! Merry Christmas! 
 It's a proper martini. Vermouth, decent gin. 
 I haven't tasted one in years. 
 Can I have a sip? 
 A sip. 
 Gosh. 
 I can see Vera's point now. 
 Hey, welcome to our night. Hope you have the greatest time. 
 When I grow up... 
 Oh! So, Ron, what do you think? 
 It looks great. It's a credit to you and the others. 
 Well, a certain liaison officer thought it up. 
 And he's either too cool or too modest to take any credit. 
 So, which is it? 
 Cool or modest? 
 Definitely not cool! 
 You're blushing, Ron Dreyfuss. You look like Rudolph. 
 What? 
 Mrs Coyne. 
 I called to discuss the arrangements with her. 
 She was a little frosty. 
 You... 
 You did tell her, like I asked? 
 Sure. 
 You know what? 
 I may not have. 
 Hey, I did. 
 Sure! I did. 
 Gotta go be a chorus girl. 
 Stuck-up English bitch. 
 Mrs Coyne. 
 Kettie? 
 How did you get in? 
 One of the soldiers knows me. 
 Oh. 
 Seamie's father came back. 
 Oh, Kettie! That's a brilliant surprise. 
 Somebody gave him a feed of poteen. 
 He came in drunk. 
 Oh. 
 Mrs Coyne, I don't want Seamie to see me like this. 
 Will I keep Seamie tonight? 
 I will. 
 Let me see. 
 Kettie. 
 It'll heal, Mrs Coyne. 
 It always heals. 
 I have him in good shape, Michael. Play it handy. 
 I'd say he'd like a whisky to warm him. 
 Maybe had one already. 
 Or two. OK? 
 Vincent. 
 [DISTANT CHATTER AND LAUGHTER] 
 Sir, you are under arrest! 
 Hey, hey, hey, get your hands off me! 
 Emma, everything tickety-boo? 
 Everything is absolutely terrible. 
 I have been surrounded by wild little beasts, and I'll probably never see Andrew again. 
 I should be relieved about that, but, God, what do I know? 
 Seamie is staying with us tonight. 
 Is there some logical connection I'm supposed to find between those two statements? 
 Mum? 
 Mrs Coyne. 
 Captain Dreyfuss. 
 A moment. 
 What's this? 
 Mrs Coyne, it's a present. I- t's so inappropriate. 
 It's for the family, the table. 
 I brought it back from Connecticut, from my leave. I thought... 
 Leave? 
 You've been on leave? 
 I've been on leave for two weeks, nearer three. 
 Back home in New Canaan, Connecticut. I thought... 
 Tillie didn't tell you, did she? 
 Oh, gosh. 
 No, she didn't. 
 I had no idea. 
 That's why I was so... 
 Cold. 
 I thought you'd simply cut me dead. 
 I had no business thinking any of it. 
 Yes, you had, Rose. 
 Can I call you Rose again? 
 Yes. 
 Oh, God, yes, call me anything. 
 You were away, and you thought I knew and... 
 Captain. 
 We have an incident out here. They're looking for you. 
 I'm on it. 
 Perhaps we could discuss this further when I'm through with this? 
 It's the man from the pub, isn't it, Francis? 
 Ned Hanlon. 
 I hope he doesn't spoil Christmas. 
 Thank you, Sergeant. 
 Mr Hanlon. 
 I know you. 
 Yes, you do. Captain Dreyfuss, liaison officer. 
 Whatever that means! 
 Mr Hanlon, I would be happy to entertain you, but this is a matter of security. 
 I'm going to have to ask the sergeant to escort you. 
 I came to see my house. I'll not be thrown out! 
 We will not throw you out, Mr Hanlon. 
 The sergeant will walk with you as far as the gatehouse. 
 Well... 
 I lived here, Captain, and my father and his father lived here long before your country was even discovered. 
 And when yous have gone... my people may live here again. 
 Amen to that, Mr Hanlon. 
 Now, on your way out, all I can offer you is a glass of soda, I'm afraid. 
 Soda? 
 Sure, soda would be no good to me, son. 
 I'd take a wee bit of cake, though. 
 I hope you have a result for me, Michael. 
 Michael, where is he? 
 What's after happening here? 
 It came home to me just what Vincent Coyne's game is. 
 The betrayal of a sacred trust - his father's and mine - for money. 
 Michael, for heaven's sake. 
 I needed you to come to an arrangement with him. 
 I came to an arrangement. I told him I'd see him in court! 
 Michael. 
 I had one drink to stiffen my nerve. 
 One drink. 
 Yeah, one. 
 And where is your cousin? 
 Waiting for you under a tree, I suppose. 
 Michael, did you put him out? In the cold? 
 Where are you going? 
 To find him! 
 See if I can salvage anything, see if I can save your pub!

 What are we going to do? Rose... 
 I tried to convince myself that you not caring for me was for the best. 
 It was for the best. 
 Yes. 
 And here in my head I knew that, and so I didn't ask Tillie about you and yet every time I met her, I wanted to tug at her sleeve and say, "Where is he? Why doesn't he love me any more?" while my heart screamed out, "As I love him." 
 And all the while, I have children who love me, and a good man who doesn't tell me, but who I know loves me, and every day I am unfaithful to him in my mind. 
 Oh, hey! 
 What a surprise. Captain Dreyfuss and Mrs Coyne. 
 I'm guessing you missed the Tillie Girls' moment of fame. 
 You didn't tell Mrs Coyne that I was on leave. 
 I forgot. 
 You worked with me for two weeks on the planning of this party. 
 How could you forget? 
 I didn't think it would be that important for Mrs Coyne, so it slipped my mind. 
 I was busy. 
 Busy, busy. I'm sorry, Captain. 
 Now, I've got to take you away. 
 We need you downstairs doing your job, saying good night to the kids and thanking the good people who organised and executed this party. 
 I need to go home early. 
 Mum? 
 Will you bring Francis and Kate? 
 And Seamie. 
 Mum, what is happening? 
 [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] 
 Well, boys and girls of Moybeg, I hope you had a night to remember. 
 [CHEERING] 
 I hope each and every one of you got all the candies and cookies and soda you could handle, and the present you always wanted. 
 Sadly, it's time to go home. 
 [GROANING] 
 So, on your behalf, I want to thank the teachers who brought you here and who are going to see you back to the guardhouse. 
 And all the boys and girls from Station 328, Tillie and the Tillie Girls... all the singers and dancers, the band. 
 [FANFARE PLAYS] 
 Snow White, Santa Claus, can't forget him. 
 You boys and girls gave the kids a good time, and I believe enhanced the image and standing of Station 328 in the community of Moybeg. 
 I want to thank all of you for your effort, for your dedication, for your... 
 Hear! Hear! sense of optimism and fun in these dark times. 
 We can tidy up in the morning. 
 For now, I think you can allow yourselves to take a bow, and a drink while you're at it. 
 Good night, kids. Safe home. 
 Happy Christmas! 
 Good words. 
 Don't be angry, Ron. 
 Why would I be angry? 
 About my not telling Rose Coyne you went on leave. 
 You know what? 
 I did it to save her from herself. 
 She was a jackrabbit in the headlights. 
 Not that I blame her. 
 But she's a married woman. 
 As I am a married man. 
 My wife Rhonda has fought a long battle with mental illness. 
 My three weeks' leave was for her attempted suicide. 
 So, you're right. 
 It probably didn't matter if Mrs Coyne knew I was away. 
 Probably for the best. 
 I feel sick. The podcorm. 
 Popcorn. 
 Emma! Emma! 
 You're here! 
 I came to tell you I'm so, so sorry. 
 I even apologised to Barney. 
 [THUNDER RUMBLES] 
 He wasn't much mollified, but... 
 Would you please, please forgive me? 
 If you knew how sad I was. 
 Yes! 
 Yes? Yes! 
 Oh, I can give you a lift home. I can give you a life home, yeah? 
 Yes! 
 Come on, guys, let's get in. Oh, muddy shoes! 
 Dad is gonna to kill me. Come on, in you go. 
 Rose! 
 Rose! 
 I'm sorry. I thought Rose might be... 
 Mum's gone home. 
 I just wanted to say... good night. 
 Shall I tell her? 
 Rose. 
 You're soaked. 
 Yes. Need to change. 
 Where are the children? 
 Emma's bringing them home. 
 Here. 
 Let me. 
 Why aren't you at the pub? 
 I closed it. 
 I took the night off. 
 Michael, have you been drinking? 
 One. To give me courage. 
 Courage? 
 Oh, Lord, what... 
 What do you... 
 What do you know? 
 [DOOR OPENS] 
 The children, thank God! 
 Mum, we're here! 
 Andrew brought us home. 
 Dry as bones. 
 I bet he'd like a cup of tea. 
 Er, yes, that'd be lovely. 
 He'd better be getting off home. 
 Get the children upstairs. 
 Good night, Andrew. 
 Daddy, we saw Santa and a cowboy and a pretty girl and the drunk man from the pub. 
 Snow White. 
 And Ned Hanlon. 
 I'll come up and hear everything in a minute, I promise. 
 Upstairs now. 
 Rose, please. 
 Oh, peasant. 
 Rose Coyne, I, erm... 
 ..I have something to give you. 
 I should have given it to you years ago. 
 It's for the one I never got you. 
 Oh, God, no. 
 Take it. 
 It's beautiful. 
 I don't deserve such a thing. 
 Put it on. 
 I... 
 I don't deserve it. 
 I don't deserve you. 
 [VEHICLE PULLS UP] 
 I... Don't say "I love you". I know you do, Rose. 
 It's Harrington! 
 There's someone at the door, grown-ups! 
 Dammit! 
 James. 
 I had to come back, Michael. 
 Oh, hello, Mrs Coyne. 
 Just go through there. 
 I spoke to him. 
 He's bulling mad, Michael. 
 He says he's not letting you buy it back. 
 He's putting it on the open market. 
 To sell to allcomers? 
 He'd sell the licence to a stranger over our head? 
 Well, that seems to be his mind-set, I'm afraid. 
 Oh, happy Christmas. 
 Oh, God. 
 Good night, Mr Coyne, Mrs Coyne. 
 Andrew, good night. 
 This house is like a French farce. 
 People emerging from cupboards. 
 Where do I put Seamie? 
 Anywhere. 
 Rose? 
 I... 
 I forgot something. 
 Rose! 
 It's called a dressing table. 
 I think Mammy's getting one of them. 
 Rose! 
 [ENGINE TURNS OVER] 
 Rose! 
 [ENGINE TURNS OVER] 
 Rose! 
 I came to tell you... 
 I know. I need to go. 
 Yes! 
 A posting... far away... to save us both. 
 Yes. 
 Far away. 
 No! 
 Rose... 
 No, never leave me.
