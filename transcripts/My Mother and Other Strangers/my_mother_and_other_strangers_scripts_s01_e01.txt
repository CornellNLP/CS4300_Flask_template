 The other day I found a note in a box of my mother's letters. 
 'It was not addressed to me, but to my older sister, Emma.' 
 Oh, come on! 
 'To this day, I'm not sure if she ever saw it. But reading it started me thinking again about a long-vanished time in my life. About the summer of 1943... in Moybeg on the shores of Lough Neagh.' 
 (Plane engine drones) 
 Race you to see her land. 
 (Engine drones) 
 Good afternoon, Mrs. Coyne. 
 Good afternoon. 
 (Birds squawk, plane engine drones) 
 Mistress. 
 Sorry to keep you. 
 (Engine drones loudly) 
 Them Futriss bombers make some racket, eh? 
 It's not "Futriss", Seamie. It's "Fortress". Fortress bombers. 
 Who says? 
 My mother. 
 Huh! Your mother talks funny. 
 And an ounce of tobacco. 
 I hear your lot are taking a bit of a hammering over beyond in Italy, Mrs. Coyne. 
 That depends on whom you listen to, Mr. Hanlon. 
 And two ounces of lard. 
 That'll be two and sixpence ha'penny. And the coupons. 
 Here... What's this? 
 This is Spam. 
 What about the good stuff? 
 Good stuff? 
 The corned beef. 
 Corned beef?! 
 I don't have corned beef, Mr. Hanlon. 
 Michael does. 
 Over there. 
 Well, you can ask Mr. Coyne. 
 I don't know anything about it. 
 Ask him, then. Get him in here from the bar. We'll ask him. 
 Mr. Coyne has gone on an errand. 
 Cheeky buggers. 
 Have you ever got corned beef here, Ellen Quinn? 
 Er... no, Mrs. Coyne. I never did. 
 (Whispering in background) 
 She looked affronted, didn't she? 
 Right... Mrs. Quinn. Your rations. 
 Thank you. Bye. 
 (They laugh) 
 Is that the lot? 
 For now. 
 Well, did they not have everything you wanted? 
 Gosh, no, not even close. 
 I'm going to have to go to Belfast to get the history stuff I need. 
 Oh! 
 Not very hot on the War of the Spanish Succession, Magherafelt Library. 
 No. 
 You comin' to the dump? 
 I'm not allowed. You're not allowed, either. 
 Nobody's allowed. 
 Oh, come on, feardy-cat. 
 Look. 
 Look what I found. 
 Neeeeeow, boom! 
 Here... give me that back. 
 Dump's full of them. 
 Oh, come on! 
 Where's our Seamie? 
 Don't know, Kettie. 
 Is he at the dump again? 
 He might be. 
 Hey. Are you that kid from the bar? 
 Hop on. 
 C'mon... 
 C'mon, we're not going to eat you. 
 Come here. I'll help you up. 
 Yeah, there you go. 
 All right, now hold on tight. OK? 
 Here, buddy. 
 Get you down, all right? 
 There you go. 
 Thank you. 
 Want a beer? 
 Yeah. 
 Want a beer? Yeah. 
 Yeah. 
 You left school hours ago. Where have you been? 
 I was up at the 'drome with Seamie. 
 Did you go to the dump with him? 
 No. 
 That boy will swing, I swear. 
 Butter... 
 (Knock on door) 
 Hi. Um, can we get a beer, landlady? 
 Of course. 
 I'm just serving the rations, but Francis will take care of you. 
 All right. 
 I need you to go and mind the bar. 
 Mum! 
 Just keep count of the beers. And keep them away from the till. 
 (He chuckles) 
 Are you the barman now, huh? 
 Mr. Barman, can I get three beers, please? 
 I'd be happy if I had a year at home to just be me. 
 You're old, Daddy. I'm... 
 Impatient. And clever as anything. 
 You'll be 17 when you go up to university. 
 And you'll still probably be the youngest in the year. 
 You won't be stuck for a social life in the meantime. 
 There's another ceilidh in the hall tonight. 
 Yes. Ned Hanlon step-dancing in his hobnail boots. 
 I can't wait(!) 
 Welcome to the social round in Moybeg, Emma. 
 (Clucking) 
 (She mimics clucking sound) 
 I'll take over now, Francis. 
 Thanks, Daddy. 
 Is Mum doing the rations? 
 Yes. 
 You help Emma with her books. OK? 
 Where did you get these? 
 The library. 
 The library? Why did you get so many? 
 I took everyone's tickets. 
 Afternoon. Good. 
 Hi, how's it going? 
 We have the potato pickers in tomorrow, Sally. 
 I'm ready for them, Mr. Coyne. 
 How long is the holiday? 
 Two weeks. The usual. 
 Barney gave me a baby pig today. 
 Hokies. What's his name? 
 Piggy. He was sick and I'm rearing him. 
 Barney's rearing him, really. 
 Well, I look after him... don't I, Sally? 
 Barney feeds him. 
 Francis, bringing someone up isn't just about feeding them. 
 It's about minding and caring and feeling... 
 Feeding has its part to play, all the same. 
 Them eels were well cooked, Sally. 
 Michael! 
 I'm trying to get the children to speak properly. "Them eels"? 
 Well, that's how we say it in Moybeg. 
 The man I met said "those". 
 Aye, you met him in England, Rose. 
 It'll be busy tonight. 
 There's a few evening passes being given out up on the 'drome. 
 So they tell me. 
 Emma could help. 
 She can. But she may not. 
 The pub's no place for a young girl. 
 Emma can help in the grocery. 
 And she may. 
 Is that English enough for you, Rose, huh? 
 (Jovial chatter) 
 Woman : Do you like my new dress? 
 (Band strikes up) 
 (Ceilidh music stops, applause) 
 Um... would you like to...? 
 No, Barney! 
 I can't do ceilidh dancing. 
 Neither can I. 
 Um, but we could give it a go? 
 Here, Barney Quinn. C'mon! 
 (Music resumes) 
 Brought his dancing shoes! 
 (Men laugh) 
 Come on, Wilson... 
 Come on. Come on, Wilson. Wilson... 
 (Laughter) 
 Whoo! 
 All right, boys, well, this is a dance, but they call it a ceilidh... 
 (Music stops) 
 Carry on! 
 (Music resumes) 
 Wow! Did not look welcoming. 
 Hey, y'know... It kinda reminds me of home. 
 Like, in my part of Kentucky, folks, they've gotta know you before they accept you. 
 Are you a hillbilly, Lieutenant? 
 (In a hillbilly accent) : I do b'lieve I may be. Ha-ha. 
 Looking for women, is it, Yanks? 
 Relax, guys. 
 No, not after your girls. Just headin' back to base. 
 Back to the land you took off us? 
 Here, boys, none of yous have a Lucky Strike for me? 
 It's good. 
 Night, guys. 
 Good to see there's no war for you, huh? 
 Come on, Wilson. 
 Blirts. 
 (Plane engine drones) 
 (She gasps) 
 Hi. I hope I'm not intruding on a private place. 
 It's not private. Anyone can come here. 
 Anyone would want to. 
 You live in a beautiful place. 
 Goodbye! 
 Hey! 
 Hey, I saw you last night, right? 
 Yeah. What's your name? 
 Emma Coyne. 
 Emma Coyne? 
 Yeah. 
 Emma Coyne. And the barman. 
 You want a ride? 
 Yeah, come on. Come on, here, I'll help you up. 
 There you go, watch the step. 
 Is the weather always like this? It is awful! 
 Stop here, Lieutenant. Here. 
 This is where we get the eels. 
 Thank you. 
 Thank you. 
 Emma... Emma, wait! 
 (He sighs) 
 (He chears his throat) 
 Don't you, uh... 
 Don't you find it a little humdrum around here? 
 The endless rain and the wind and the rocks and... the water. 
 I like it here. 
 I like the lough. 
 It's home. Oh, hey, I'm... I'm a country boy myself, but I know that... that time can hang heavy in the fall. 
 Uh, do you like to dance? 
 Jitterbug? You know how to do that? 
 No?! 
 Uh, movies! Do you like the movies? 
 The pictures? 
 Yeah, yeah! 
 Yeah. I like them. 
 Huh. 
 My brother. 
 Oh, yeah, yeah. Little brothers, yeah. 
 Uh, well, listen, Emma... 
 If you find that this place hangs heavy on you, I'm around. 
 You just say the word and it would be my pleasure to add a little bit of fun to your days, all right? 
 And, uh... And here you go. 
 Oh! 
 It's... 
 It's hardly worth a mention. Just a little, little present. 
 To a really sweet, cute, modest girl. 
 Just a little something from me to you. 
 Thanks. 
 (Whispers) : Francis. 
 Don't tell Mum... that we got a lift. OK? 
 Pardon me. 
 Oh, hey. We already met. 
 Yes. Er, the Far Rock. 
 I guess I should introduce myself this time. 
 Ronald Dreyfuss, Captain, US Army Air Force. 
 Rose Coyne. 
 You're the wife of the landlord? 
 That's me. The wife. 
 Erm, sorry... Oh. 
 Erm, so... let me explain then, Mrs. Coyne.  Um... 
 I've just been posted to Moybeg as Station 328 Liaison and Co-operation Officer. 
 Basically, my job is to make sure we don't tread on too many toes in the community. 
 Liaison? Yes. 
 So, I know some of the men drink here... and I thought... 
 I called because I thought your husband, um... 
 Michael. 
 Michael. 
 ..might have some suggestions on how the locals and airmen can best get along. Coexist. 
 And, um, I-I wasn't expecting to find you. 
 As you, if you see what I mean. The lady on the shore. 
 You make me sound like a Tennysonian heroine. 
 "'I am half sick of shadows,' said the Lady of Shallot." 
 Gosh. That's, erm, a bit of a favourite of mine, that one. 
 Um, now I know who you are, I ought to just ask you, I guess. As well. 
 Instead of, even. Perhaps. 
 I think I may take that as my cue... to start the learning curve. 
 So... You're busy. 
 I'm not always busy, Captain Dreyfuss. I would like to help. 
 You could... call over to the house. 
 Why, thank you. 
 I think I may take you up on that kind offer. 
 Thank you, Mrs. Coyne. 
 Young Coynes! Eels, is it? 
 Daddy says have you a dozen good ones, Failey? 
 "Good ones"? And does he think I would give him bad? 
 An' you with the bride-to-be workin' in the house? 
 Sally'll get her church wedding, don't you worry! 
 There, 20 good silver eels. 
 And a couple extra. 
 Any word of messages? 
 Now, you tell your father Failey says thanks. 
 Say hello to Sally for him! 
 Tell her he'll see her this evening... maybe. 
 Were you out for a spin? 
 No. 
 We went to get eels from the harbour. 
 Only, I heard the jeep on the road. 
 I thought you might've went for a spin... with the Yankee. 
 You know what thought did, Barney Quinn. 
 The mistress says you're to collect the duck eggs, Francis. And, Barney, will you get out from under my feet? It's near milking time. 
 I could do with potatoes peelin'. 
 Labels to the front there, Francis. There's a good lad. 
 Then off to bed. 
 Three shots, sir. 
 Hi. 
 Here, boys... what's wrong with the long fella? 
 Battle fatigue, bud. 
 You funked it, didn't you, Willy? Poor sap. 
 Battle fatigue, eh? 
 You see, round here, we call that tremblin'. 
 It doesn't matter what you call it, old man. 
 All right? Cos none of y'all are ever going to suffer from it. 
 I suffered the loss of my house. If that's any odds. 
 Battle fatigue. 
 What? 
 Good night, Daddy. 
 Night. Three whiskys. 
 Knock! 
 I helped in the pub. 
 Lucky you. 
 I saw a man with battle fatigue. 
 Was the pilot there? The one that gave us the lift? 
 Yes, he was. 
 He drank a lot of beers. 
 Thank you. 
 There you go, boys... 
 Hey, hey! 
 Careful now, buddy boy, all right? 
 You're OK, Yank, eh? It's only a wee drop spilt, eh? 
 Or maybe your hands are tremblin' too, eh? 
 Like that there fella there, hey! 
 All right, all right! All right... 
 He did that on purpose. 
 You think? 
 For sure. 
 Men. 
 ♪ Green grows the lily-o ♪ 
♪ Right among the bushes-o ♪ 
♪ She swore by grass, she swore by... ♪ 
 
 
 
 Leave it now, Davey. Like a good young man, hey? 
 Yes? 
 Mrs. Coyne? 
 Hi. Um... Could I have a word with Mr. Coyne? 
 Pub's closed, son. Sunday. 
 Ah, that's not what I came for, sir. Ah. 
 What did you come for? 
 I came to ask permission, sir. 
 Permission? For what? 
 I would like to date your daughter, sir. 
 Date? 
 Yes, sir. 
 Dates come in a packet, at the Lammas Fair. 
 I don't... I don't know what that means. 
 Just go home, young fella. 
 Sir, I know this might... 
 Are you astray in the head? She's still at school. She's 16. 
 I'm 20, sir... Just go back up the road you came down... son. 
 (Engine starts) 
 Emma! 
 That was the young fella from the 'drome. 
 Lieutenant Barnhill. 
 Do you know what he wanted? 
 Good. I was hoping you didn't. 
 I mean, who the hell does he think he is? 
 I mean, what is wrong with him? 
 Emma is 16. 
 Obviously, in America, they... 
 This isn't America. 
 I know. 
 I know what this place is. 
 Yeah... but do you? 
 It isn't England either, Rose. 
 I know. I get told that all the time, Michael. 
 Do you want him to go out with her? Is that it? 
 Where did that come from? 
 Why are you so threatened? He came and asked. 
 Yeah, we don't ask here. 
 So what do we do? 
 We wait. Is that it? 
 Yeah. We wait. 
 Until it's time. 
 Like Failey under his boat down at the lough, who's not asked Sally this ten years. 
 Come here. 
 Of course I don't want Emma to go with him, or anyone. 
 He seemed like a polite young man, but... she's far too young to even consider a serious relationship. 
 All right? 
 Look what I have. 
 Ah, Maisie. Mammy told you to stay away from that place. 
 I was going to give it to you. 
 Eh? 
 You could give it as a present. 
 To who? 
 You know who. I know you're astray in the head about her. 
 I don't know what you're talking about, but I can do better than an old necklace from the dump. 
 Suit yourself, brother. 
 Takes more than a necklace to get Emma Coyne to look at you, anyway. 
 Are you going out? 
 I'm going to the pictures. 
 Class! I'll get my corduroy jacket. 
 You can't come. 
 Did Daddy say I couldn't? 
 I'm not going with Daddy. 
 I'm going with the pilot who gave us the lift. 
 The one Daddy shouted at? 
 He didn't tell me not to. 
 Those are Mum's, Emma. 
 He didn't tell me not to. You were a witness. 
 Did he say not to? 
 He meant it, I bet you. 
 He'll be raging. 
 Go on. I have to dress. 
 If they ask, lie like anything. 
 Say I'm down at Quinns, down seeing Maisie. 
 You're not going to kiss him, are you? 
 No, no, I'm not. 
 But I could if I wanted to. 
 It's all right for you. You can play cowboys with Seamie. 
 I'm 16 and stranded. 
 And he's nice. 
 He's nice, isn't he? 
 Hey, look who it is! 
 Top o' the morning, guys! 
 It's the girl from the bar. 
 I'm going to get some cigarettes. 
 Lucky Stripe, please. 
 Keep the change. 
 Barnhill. Hey. 
 Oh, you never cease to amaze. 
 No, this isn't what you think, Wilson. 
 Ah-ha. 
 That's Emma Coyne. 
 Emma, hi! 
 Minnie Ryan. 
 You were in Moybeg school with my sister. 
 Michael Coyne will kill you. 
 I want to go. 
 Come on, Emma. The movie hasn't even started yet. 
 I really want to go. Please. 
 I got popcorn. I bet you never tasted popcorn before, huh? 
 C'mon, Emma. Emma, what are you doing? 
 Emma? 
 Sit down! 
 Hey, Barnhill, can't keep your date happy, huh? 
 Oh, God! Daddy is going to be really, really cross! 
 Emma, your Pop's got nothing to be mad about, all right? 
 I didn't even get a kiss. 
 What do you expect, Emma? 
 Stop. 
 Emma? 
 What? 
 I'd kiss you now that the other girls aren't looking. 
 You're really just a kid... aren't you? 
 I'm not. 
 I'm 16. 
 And if you're so grown up, you show me, then. 
 Hey. 
 Let's get you home, all right? 
 I bet all the other girls know how to kiss. 
 (He laughs) 
 Kiss? 
 So wrong verb, Emma Coyne. 
 Failey. 
 Michael, I've just seen Emma going up the road with a Yank. 
 If you so much as laid a finger on her! 
 Daddy. I'm really sorry. 
 I only wanted to see the film. 
 Emma... you get into the house, right now. 
 Francis, get away from that window! 
 It was Gone With The Wind, sir. 
 We left after ten minutes because your daughter wanted to. 
 You called round to ask me. Remember what I said? 
 Yes, sir, and, with respect, though it wasn't very pleasant, you actually never said... 
 Not very pleasant?! 
 But, sir, I realise... 
 You stay the hell away from my daughter, you Yankee blirt! 
 Please, sir, do not make me defend myself. 
 It's a nice night, Michael. 
 Hey! 
 Hey. Do you want a ride? 
 No? No? 
 What, don't take a ride with the devil incarnate? 
 Your Pop tell you that? 
 Yeah. 
 Well, walking's good for you, anyhow. 
 No hard feelings, all right, and I like your hat. 
 Where are the other men? 
 Oh, Noches is around here somewhere. 
 But Wilson's gone, or he's going. 
 He's going right about now, I think. 
 (Plane thunders overhead) 
 Yeah, Lima Mike. 
 Lima Mike, that's him! 
 There you go, old Wilson! 
 You go, old boy, you go! 
 Go on, Wilson. 
 Go. 
 God, you ancient old pelican. 
 Yeah, I'm going, too, kid. 
 Yeah, day after tomorrow. 
 But if you see Hitler, you don't tell him I said that, all right, cos that is... that's top secret information. 
 Oh, man. Oh, boy, I am not going to miss Station 328. 
 Yeah, it won't miss me, either. 
 You know what amazes me? 
 You folks. 
 This place. 
 You just take it for granted everything's going to be OK. 
 That the eels will always swim in. 
 The flax and the barley will always grow. 
 Everything's just going to stay the same. 
 But it ain't so, kid. 
 No. 
 All over the place, Russia, China, Poland, places just like this one, they're finding that out. 
 Oh, and Wilson. 
 Oh, Wilson, he's ornery as all hell. 
 He didn't care for this place. 
 He didn't like your Pop. 
 He hated those fishermen clodhoppers. 
 Yeah, but he is going to go put his life on the line to make sure y'all can keep on keeping on. 
 You sure you don't want a ride? 
 Yeah? Well... you have a good life, kid. 
 Mum... you searched my room? 
 I was putting away your socks. 
 I thought you were told not to see that young man. 
 He gave that to me before any of this happened. 
 Before Daddy was so cross with me. 
 Come here. 
 He just wants to protect you. 
 But Lieutenant Barnhill was really nice. 
 When I wanted to go home, some of the other boys laughed at him. 
 He's nicer than any of the boys around here, especially Barney Quinn. 
 Barney is a decent boy. 
 He's pretty rural, Mum. Let's face it. 
 I don't know why Daddy's so cross with me. 
 I didn't do anything. 
 You went to the pictures with an American airman, with Minnie Ryan and Bridie Hagan. 
 What's wrong with Minnie and Bridie? 
 I'm so posh I can't be seen in the same cinema as them? 
 I don't see what's so funny, Mum? 
 We have Keir Hardie in our midst. 
 You always do that. 
 You always say something that I don't understand or Daddy doesn't understand to prove that you're right and you know more than us... 
 Emma... and what was wrong wasn't that I went to the pictures. 
 It was that I was just the same as Bridie and Minnie and not high and mighty Emma Coyne, the mistress's daughter. 
 That is not so, Emma. 
 Your father believes you when you say nothing happened, but not everyone does. 
 There are men in this townland who will laugh at him. 
 It's me they should laugh at. 
 Or me. 
 Do I really always resort to saying things you don't understand? 
 Yes! Yes, you do. 
 No, you don't. 
 Sometimes. 
 Now, we won't let your father see this. 
 I'll take it while we decide what to do with it. 
 You're not to use it. 
 You're not to see him. 
 Promise me. 
 Captain Dreyfuss. 
 Mrs. Coyne. Is this a good time? 
 Well, I think we need to talk. 
 Come in. 
 This is quite difficult. 
 It is? 
 Yes. 
 I don't want to get anyone into trouble. 
 Trouble? 
 Help me here, Mrs. Coyne. 
 I'm not sure how a few pointers on how to fit in could possibly land anyone in trouble. 
 You're not here about what happened last evening? 
 I-I... I'd no idea something had happened. 
 Ah... 
 One of the men took my daughter to the pictures without my consent. 
 What was his name? 
 But, with her consent, Captain Dreyfuss, so if you don't mind, I won't give you his name. 
 I don't believe he meant any harm, and my daughter said he was sweet and chivalrous. 
 I don't want him punished any more than he has been. 
 Has been? 
 Er, Michael was very upset. 
 He let the young man know forcefully. 
 Forcefully? Were there blows? 
 Almost. 
 No father finds it easy to cope with the idea that his daughter is the object of, er, let's say, desire, Captain Dreyfuss. 
 Do you have children of your own? 
 No. 
 I am, er, I'm not married. 
 I should go. 
 Our notes on Moybeg can wait until another time, given how you must feel right now. 
 I will take this further if you wish. 
 It's over, as far as I'm concerned. 
 Are you sure, Mrs. Coyne? 
 Yes, Captain Dreyfuss, I'm sure. 
 Oh, excuse me. 
 You didn't come back. 
 The shore, The Far Rock. 
 I walk there every day. 
 That's how I know, but... you must feel free to walk there. 
 The lough, this place, it's for everyone. 
 You have a young fella out there, Michael, you might want to... 
 You're not welcome here. Surely to God you know that. 
 I just got posted, sir, all right? 
 I'm due to depart for England real soon. 
 I just wanted one last drink with my pal here. 
 Michael, let him in. 
 The lad's off to do his duty. 
 Go on. 
 One! 
 Noches! 
 Hey, Noches! 
 Give me a hand to redd up, will you, Barney? 
 Noches! 
 He went home a while ago. 
 Mr. Coyne. 
 Lieutenant. 
 I'm, er, you know, I'm, er, I'm really sorry for what happened, sir. 
 I-I didn't mean any harm. 
 Go home while you're still ahead, son. 
 Good luck to you. 
 Noches! 
 Emma. 
 (Shouts) : Emma! 
 (Dog barks) 
 Emma! 
 Whoa! No! No! Mr. Coyne! 
 Mr. Coyne! No! 
 No! No! 
 (Distant scuffle) 
 Emma? 
 (Scuffle continues) 
 (Distant angry voices) 
 Mum! Mum! 
 The pilot, Lieutenant Barnhill. 
 OK. Catch your breath. They're hitting him in the byre. 
 Ned and Mickey Joe and all those bullies. They're hurting him! 
 Daddy! Barney, did you know about this? I did not, Mr. Coyne. I swear. 
 Emma. Stay here. Barney, come with me. 
 Boys! 
 Leave him alone. 
 You stay out of this, Michael Coyne! 
 We're doing the job for you. 
 Maybe now the Yanks will leave our women alone. 
 Get away from him. 
 Michael doesn't keep that gun loaded, Mrs. Coyne. 
 He told me often enough. 
 Do you want to test that theory, Michael Hanlon? 
 Rose. 
 Get away from him! 
 Cowards! 
 (He coughs) 
 Mr. Coyne, in light of what just happened, the Commanding Officer has placed your bar out of bounds for a period of two months. 
 Two months? He wanted to put it out of bounds, period. 
 I had to argue very hard. 
 Thank you. 
 Do you mind? 
 The Commanding Officer also wanted me to ask if Lieutenant Barnhill gave a good account of himself? 
 He did. 
 Good. Good. 
 We expect our fellows to give as good as they get, and apparently Lieutenant Barnhill is the current Kentucky golden gloves champion. 
 That said, I want to say thank you for stepping in to save him. 
 Now, Mrs. Coyne, I think it's more important than ever that we try to understand how to avoid things like last night. 
 I would very much appreciate the benefit of your local knowledge. 
 Rose is about as local as Winston Churchill. 
 But you're right. 
 She does seem to be able to make better sense of things in this parish than I do. 
 I have to go, Captain. 
 Thank you for calling. 
 Lieutenant Barnhill received his posting. 
 He leaves in a few days. 
 He was the airman who took your daughter to the movies, right? 
 Gosh, yes. How did you know? 
 I figured. The fight. I thought there might be a connection. 
 Perhaps retribution by the men of the parish, so I asked him. 
 Men? Four to one. 
 He asked me to give you this to pass on to Emma if you felt it was... 
 Appropriate. 
 I have read it. I find I am camp censor, for my sins. 
 It is a simple, rather sweet goodbye. 
 I don't want to. 
 Read it? 
 Read it or give it. 
 What if he is killed in action? 
 She is too young to know that a young man went to his death thinking of her. 
 You may tell him I took it, but I reserve the right not to pass it on to her. 
 It would cast a shadow over her life. 
 I understand. 
 Mrs. Coyne. 
 You knew. 
 What? 
 What was being planned. 
 I didn't. 
 I swear. 
 Barney did. 
 Maybe. 
 What did you want him to do? 
 The Yankees will move on. 
 Barney has to live here. 
 With that sly deal with the devil that everybody in this parish seems to have struck. 
 (Bloody Moybeg.) 
 It's life, Rose. 
 We're lucky to be able to hold on to it. 
 Sometimes you have to use a long spoon to dine with the devil. 
 Especially when you're dining on corned beef. 
 Uh? 
 Nothing. 
 Are you sorry? 
 About what? 
 I don't know. About the trouble you caused? 
 It wasn't my fault. 
 You went to the pictures. 
 "You went to the pictures". Neh! 
 It didn't mean they had to gang up on him, the Hanlons and all, and shut up about it. 
 Do you think they would have killed him if Mum hadn't have... 
 (Planes roar overhead) 
 Battle Fatigue! 
 Barnhill. 
 Brave, decent Barnhill didn't long survive his rescue by my mother. 
 A swarm of Focke Wulf 190s set on him over Dusseldorf, one moonlit night in 1944, and though he fought a long-running battle towards the Channel, he never made it. 
 He is buried among the small farmyards, the barns and byres of St Joseph, close to Wormhout in Belgium. 
 I often wonder what my father knew about that night. 
 Did he decide to let Barnhill get what was coming to him for his cheek? 
 I hope not, but my father was a Moybeg man. 
 Its darkness may have lain somewhere deep in his DNA. 
 My mother, on the other hand, resisted what she called the sly ways of the place with a fiery, feral determination. 
 She dwelt in Moybeg, but she didn't live there. 
 And it seems she never gave Barnhill's letter to Emma. 
 Perhaps she felt that a note from beyond the grave was just too much for my sister to bear even as a grown woman. 
 What's this? What do you think it is? 
 Stolen goods. 
 Mrs. Coyne. 
 Rose, please. 
 Men are a deal more likely to do favours for a woman than for a man. 
 Did you want me to flirt? 
 My name is Andrew Black. I'm the doctor's son. 
 He is REALLY nice. 
 Bailiffs! 
 What are you doing? They've got the flag up. 
 Well, they may put it down again. 
 Blirts! 
 Jail for our friend. 
 I have to tell the truth, Seamie!
