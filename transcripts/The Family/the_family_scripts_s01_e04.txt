 Previously on "The Family"... 
 What does he look like? 
 H-He has holes in his face. 
 Anyone who has ever worked at this refinery could've known how to get into that tunnel. 
 Oh! Oh, God. 
 You are early. 
 I couldn't wait to see my baby. 
 Aww. 
 Both my babies. 
 I am announcing my candidacy for governor. 
 Could I have a minute alone? Just a minute? 
 The older brother's not totally sure Adam is Adam. 
 How the hell did you get that? 
 Would you consider your neighbor Hank Asher a monster? 
 Yeah, absolutely. Yes, yes, I would. 
 If he had been chipped after being convicted of his first s*x offense, we could've cleared him. 
 When did it start? 
 What? 
 You sleeping with the dad. 
 Few months after. 
 Just wondering if it ever clouded your vision. 
 I'm sorry for what happened to you. 
 You happened to me. 
 Your family happened to me. 
 Why did you confess? 
 They had stuff on me. 
 We stopped looking because you said you killed him. 
 I didn't lock the boy in a basement. 
 No. You just made sure that he stayed there. 
 Most of us never find out what we're really made of. 
 If we could lift a car off someone... save a life... take one. 
 If they cut you open, what would they find... feathers or steel? 
 Answer me that... I'll tell you if you're a mother. 
 You're not on my list. 
 Excuse me? 
 I get to choose who visits me. 
 It's the little things. 
 I was recently elected mayor. 
 I read about that. 
 I don't have to be on a list. 
 That would explain it. 
 Where's my son? 
 What did you do with his body? 
 I can't help you with that. 
 I'm not asking for an apology. 
 I don't want to see you cry or beg. 
 I just want to have a funeral for my child with a body in the casket. 
 That's all I need from you. Do you understand me? 
 So what did you do with him after you murdered him? 
 I can't help you with that. 
 We're done here. 
 Cover of "The Trib," "USA Today," 
 "The Herald," "The Post," 
 "New York Times"... page three over the fold... 
 Well, no one reads that one. 
 I do. 
 You'll get the endorsement, Simpson drops out, then it's just you against Lang. 
 An incumbent governor with very deep pockets. 
 Whose track record we can play like a dart board. 
 Please. You're the next governor of Maine, mother. 
 It's... 
 Good morning. 
 Morning. 
 Morning. 
 Morning. 
 You want coffee or anything before you go? 
 Um... 
 Danny... 
 This is Bridey. From high school. 
 She's not a hooker. 
 Oh. 
 Why don't you sit, honey? 
 Who wants waffles? 
 If it's not too much trouble... 
 Seriously? 
 Go see if Adam's hungry, will you? 
 Yeah. Go see if Adam's hungry. 
 I'm sorry. 
 It's not your fault. 
 Yes, it is. 
 It'll come off. 
 You don't have to do that. 
 You shouldn't be here. 
 It's not coming off. 
 Adam! 
 Please. 
 Go. 
 Hey. 
 You look like you ate one of those vegan muffins Teresa made. 
 Very upsetting. 
 An 8-year-old boy was snatched from Rosemont Park an hour ago. 
 His mother assaulted and knocked unconscious. 
 Looks just like Adam. 
 M.O.'s the same, too... broad daylight in a public park. 
 Doug, where have you been? 
 I sent you like 20 texts this morning. 
 What were you... 
 Everything looks terrific, girls. 
 Doug?! 
 Think it's a copycat? 
 Well, some guy's watching the news, decides to take a kid the exact same way Adam Warren was taken? 
 Maybe. 
 What if it's not a copycat? 
 He lost Adam... so he found himself a new one. 
 What kind of sick, depraved monster... 
 Are we really doing this right now? 
 It wasn't enough for him to kill a child? 
 That didn't get his rocks off? 
 Tonight? 
 I want to have a funeral for my son. 
 Well, then, have one. Why can't we just... 
 I'm not burying an empty coffin, John! 
 Got to move on. 
 Chapter three of your book? 
 It's been almost two years. 
 Sorry if I'm not grieving gracefully enough for you. 
 Mayor Warren, can you comment? 
 Is it true the police suspect the same man who took Adam may also be... 
 That's unconfirmed. 
 You're proposing a law to chip s*x offenders. 
 Would that have helped at all in this case? 
 There's a child missing. We're not gonna politicize that. 
 We got job growth locked down, governor, but we need to shore up our position on crime. 
 A few juicy sound bites can go a long way. 
 Yeah, well, I'm not gonna do that today. 
 Claire Warren has made crime an issue. 
 I'm not gonna talk about it. 
 But she's talking about it. 
 So, let her talk about it. 
 Mayor Warren, have you spoken to the Daniels family yet? 
 Obviously, I can imagine what they're going through. 
 I want to point out that the police have issued an amber alert for a white van with the license plate beginning with "3JKE." 
 She's a one-trick pony, Scotty... a lightweight, small-town mayor running a one-issue campaign. 
 Believe me... people are gonna get tired of s*x offenders and microchips. 
 So, let her jump through her pretty hoops and her pretty ring. 
 And when the kids are done clapping for the pretty, pretty pony, we will get down to the real issues. 
 It's enough already! 
 No parent should have to go through this nightmare. 
 And if the man who took Brian is watching right now, I want you to listen to me very carefully. 
 You are on borrowed time. 
 We may not know your name or where you live, but we know who you are. 
 And we will find you. 
 Isn't this a press conference? 
 Yes, sir. 
 So, where's the damn press? 
 Sources say they have reason to believe... 
 She made me a latte this morning... the kidnapping may be connected... with almond milk. 
 ... to the Adam Warren case. 
 What does your bang buddy think? 
 He's suspicious, but he's too close to it to tell. 
 So, he lets the fox into the henhouse to figure it out for him. 
 That's ballsy. 
 Somebody get me an almond-milk latte. 
 Gus! 
 What? 
 It's his family. 
 So? 
 So, I promised him I would give him a heads up before we ran with anything. 
 Well, I didn't. 
 You try a pressure wash? 
 What? 
 On your garage. 
 Probably take some paint off, but better than what's on it now. 
 Hank Asher, right? 
 You've been served with a restraining order. 
 You're not to come in contact with or disturb the peace of John and Claire Warren or anyone in their family, including their son Adam. 
 He came over here. 
 100 yards, okay? 
 They live across the street. 
 Then don't go past that tree. 
 So, we found four surveillance cameras near the park. 
 My team's already combing through the footage. 
 Anything on the license plate? 
 Stolen off an Accord in New Haven three days ago. 
 That's helpful. 
 "What about the tip line?" he asked, already knowing the answer. 
 Flooded, thanks to Warren's press conference. 
 Anything other than the usual shut-ins and crackpots? 
 Even if someone calls with something, i-it'll take forever to find them in the haystack. 
 We don't have forever. 
 No, we do not. 
 But we have... this. 
 What do you think, Adam? 
 Take your time, honey. There's no rush. 
 Oh, God, Adam. 
 Get him some water. 
 Adam! 
 I gotcha. I gotcha. 
 God! 
 Okay. Come here. 
 Is that him? 
 Is... Is that h... Is that him? Is that the man that took you? 
 For God's sakes, give him a minute. 
 That's him, isn't it? 
 You've been assistant warden at Sinclair State Prison for 12 years now. 
 Got the scars to prove it. 
 Well, compared to herding inmates, heading up my security detail should be a lazy Sunday afternoon. 
 Welcome to the team. Thank you. 
 Give us a minute, Diane? 
 Were you able to... find out? 
 Uh, I wasn't. 
 But you had people speak to him? 
 He won't say a word. 
 Is there anything else I can do? 
 What can I do for you, Mr. Asher? 
 I want to sue the Warrens for slander and... and defamation. 
 The mayor's family. 
 That's right. 
 Can I ask how... 
 She and her husband contributed to my being wrongfully incarcerated. 
 You got a big payout from that. 
 She called me a monster on national television. 
 Not exactly grounds for... 
 There are other things, too. 
 Mr. Asher. 
 Hank. 
 Yeah. 
 You're a convicted s*x offender. She's a mother. 
 Who made my life a living hell. 
 Who lost her son. 
 My advice... use that money they gave you and go buy yourself an island. 
 I don't want an island. 
 What do you want? 
 Justice. 
 Good luck. 
 What if I was wrong? What if it's been him this whole time? 
 Okay, calm down. 
 No, no, no, no, no. 
 You didn't see him today, all right? 
 When they showed him of the guy, he... he flipped out. 
 He almost passed out. You can't fake that. 
 Look, you didn't do anything wrong. 
 You were just looking for the truth. 
 Yeah, yeah, so I called a reporter. 
 Here. Let's go somewhere and get a drink... 
 No, Bridey. I'm not drinking. 
 No, I know. I'm sorry. 
 Ju... Ju... 
 You didn't tell anyone, did you? 
 Of course not. 
 I'm your friend. 
 Yeah. 
 You can't disappear today, okay? It's a couples shower. 
 I'll be here. I will. 
 If I have to play those stupid games alone. 
 Hey, where are you going? 
 You left the sherbet in the deep freeze. 
 No. 
 What do you mean no? 
 I had to put down rat traps. There's loose floorboards. 
 It isn't safe. 
 I have to go out again. Real fast. 
 What?! 
 I'll be back in time. I'll do everything. 
 Only you have to promise me... 
 What? 
 ... you won't go in there. 
 Okay. 
 That's my girl. 
 
 
 
 Got a lead on the tip line. 
 The perp has blonde to black hair, is of short to tall build, and either has a beard or no beard at all? 
 Man says a white van with the right plates just stopped for gas at his station, left 15 minutes ago, headed north on 100. 
 Oh, my God. 
 What? 
 They... They... They caught him. CNN says he's in custody. 
 What?! 
 Uh, no. 
 W-Wait. No. They made a mistake. 
 He, uh... They were wrong. They're taking it back. 
 Okay, come on, Ad. 
 Where are you taking him? 
 He needs to get some air. 
 John. 
 There's none in here. 
 I've never seen you eat anything not in bar form. 
 Sometimes you got to get the job done. 
 Bars get the job done. 
 Now we know what your headstone's gonna say. 
 You sure you can look for this van and be superior at the same time? 
 My husband was an air-traffic controller at Logan. 
 That must have sucked. 
 Yeah, so bad, he got an ulcer. 
 He quit, and we bought five acres and some bees. 
 Say what? 
 We make honey now, and Jonah's ulcer is cured. 
 It's the enzymes. 
 I'm not saying you need to keep bees, but you got to bring a little joy into this job or you're never... 
 Hold on! 
 What the hell? 
 Look. 
 Hi, it's Doug. Leave me a message when you hear the beep. 
 You promised you'd be back. I can't keep making excuses. 
 Where are you? 
 Okay, so, choke up on the bat a little. 
 Yeah. 
 Good. 
 Elbow up. 
 Yeah, good. 
 Sorry I'm late, everyone. 
 You first, Mom. 
 From... Daddy. 
 Excuse me. 
 It's not him. 
 What? 
 How do you know? 
 He was in prison when Adam was taken, uh, for rape and attempted murder. 
 The kid's his ex-girlfriend's. 
 It smells like some kind of sick revenge thing. 
 Where's Nina? 
 There were shots fired. 
 Is she hurt? 
 Dad. 
 Is she hurt? 
 No. 
 She's fine. 
 But that's all I can tell you right now. 
 Let's review. 
 When you entered the room, did you immediately identify yourself as a police officer? 
 Yes, I did. 
 When did you see Brian Daniels? 
 As soon as I got inside. 
 And you believed him to be in immediate danger from Mr. Lipton? 
 I did. 
 He was. 
 Mr. Lipton had a gun. 
 Which he pointed at you. 
 Yes. 
 And did you tell him to drop the gun? 
 Yes. 
 And what was his response? 
 He did not. 
 And Agent Clements... he can confirm your version of events? 
 He's all right. Was the guy armed? 
 No. 
 What do you want to do here? 
 Got to do it now. 
 Agent Clements will confirm, yes. 
 Hey. 
 How does it work? 
 I'm not gonna let anything happen to you, okay? 
 What if you aren't home? 
 Okay, look. Uh... the code's your birthday... 0, 5, 2, 2. 
 And then hit... hit "arm." 
 See? Easy. 
 The code's your birthday... 0, 5, 2, 2. 
 Mayor Warren. 
 Please, call me Claire. 
 Damn it. Then it's "Charlie," too. 
 Thank you for making the drive up. 
 I asked you here to set some ground rules before the bullets fly. 
 Very sportsmanlike. 
 We both want what's best for this great state. 
 So let's make this race about education and wages and energy. 
 You're new to the scene, but races in Maine are won on issues, Claire, not celebrity. 
 Yes, Scotty? 
 I just need you to sign, sir. 
 It's budget appropriations. 
 It's a very complicated part of the job. 
 Labor unions make it almost impossible at the state level. 
 You dealt with any of that in, uh, whatsit? 
 Red Pines. 
 That's it. 
 Not as much. 
 How many freshmen in the legislature right now? 
 Is this lunch or a civics quiz? 
 You know all their names? 
 Of course I do. 
 There aren't any. Not this year. 
 You're having a moment, Claire. Enjoy it. 
 But it's not what this race is about. 
 Do you understand? 
 There are two. 
 Excuse me? 
 Well, I assumed you meant the house, as well. 
 There are two freshmen in the house... 
 Cumberland and Jones... both women. 
 So, they're probably very confused about that budget. 
 But I look forward to setting them straight as governor. 
 I understand you don't want me to talk about my son. 
 I understand that I'm not just a threat to you, I'm a nightmare because I am the voice of every parent's worst fear, and I actually intend to do something about it. 
 But don't you worry, Charlie. 
 I don't intend to chip adulterers, just criminals. 
 Mmm. 
 Ah, well, this looks lovely. 
 I'm an idiot. 
 Danny's not home. 
 I left something up in his room. 
 You could have called. 
 It was my phone. 
 This is Adam's room. 
 That's why I couldn't find it. 
 You don't like me very much. 
 I don't know you very much. 
 I know you. 
 You were a strange little girl back in the day. 
 I still am. 
 Good. 
 That makes it interesting. 
 It's that one. 
 Thanks. 
 Are these mine again? 
 Depends. 
 You gonna go to that psych eval like they told you to? 
 What's that supposed to mean? 
 I don't know what happened at that motel, but I know it didn't go down the way you and your buddy said. 
 He was gonna kill that kid. 
 I'm not saying society isn't better off. 
 But you just shot someone dead, and you're sitting here eating a candy bar. 
 I'll go see the shrink, okay? 
 I'll, um, open up and cry and talk all about how I was chubby as a kid. 
 And if you don't... 
 I'll come back and get those myself. 
 Let's go. 
 Where? 
 Mayor wants to call you a hero. 
 All right, little man. 
 Now that we have you and your mom safe and sound, here's the really important question... nacho or jalapeño? 
 Just nacho. 
 So you're old-school. I like that. 
 Let's get you comfortable in here. 
 What about soda? 
 Grape. 
 Grape? 
 Brian, i-it's like I don't even know you anymore. 
 Before things get crazy, I want to thank you both personally. 
 What a job you did on this one. Hmm! 
 I appreciate that, ma'am, and I'll let Nina speak for herself. 
 I've got some chips to buy. 
 Ohh. 
 You've gone above and beyond for my family, and I am so grateful for that. 
 All right. 
 But it's gonna stop now. 
 I'm sorry. I don't know... 
 You sleeping with my husband. 
 Do you think you're special, a one-of-a-kind snowflake? 
 You wouldn't believe how many women take their panties off for the dad who lost his son. 
 First of all, Lynn has asked me to thank the good people of Maine. 
 It's because of your tips, your initiative, your coming together when she needed it the most that she has her son Brian back. 
 Yes! 
 You know, I don't know if you all believe in miracles. 
 You know I do. 
 Today's miracle was created not just by the citizens of Maine, but by its tireless law-enforcement officers, particularly Supervisory Special Agent Gabe Clements of the FBI and Detective Nina Meyer. 
 On behalf of the whole city, let's thank them for being our heroes! 
 I-I meant to give it to you for Christmas. 
 Why didn't you? 
 It didn't seem like the right time. 
 John. 
 There's... 
 There's... something I have to tell you. 
 Um... we need to bury our son. 
 What? 
 I can't wait for a body anymore. 
 He deserves a service. He lived a life. 
 And... we've got to live ours however we can. 
 Okay. 
 Okay. 
 I'll open this tomorrow. 
 You cooked! 
 Try not to sound so shocked. 
 Join us for dinner. You can help set the table. 
 Cool. 
 Googled your girlfriend. 
 Stalker. 
 She's a reporter. She's a blogger. 
 She came back for her phone. 
 She was sniffing around Adam's room. 
 If she shows up again for her panties, tell her we'll mail them. 
 Okay. 
 You sure you want me to toss it? 
 Get it out of here, or I'll eat it. 
 I didn't want you to see it. 
 It's the wood from the walnut tree we cut down last fall. 
 Oh. 
 I was gonna surprise you when I was all done. 
 I'm an idiot. I thought... 
 What? That I was doing something shady right under your nose? 
 Come on. 
 I'm smoother than that. 
 No, you're not. 
 No, I'm not. 
 What were you doing in his room? 
 What the hell, Danny?! 
 I told you to leave it alone. 
 Are you crazy? You can't just break in here and... 
 Like you did. 
 You know who I am. 
 What did you take from his room? 
 You want a story not to be written, don't tell it to a reporter. 
 Whatever you took, give it back. 
 It's too late. 
 You're a lying bitch. 
 Well, you're a stupid drunk. 
 This obviously isn't gonna end in s*x, so why don't you just go? 
 Natural energy. 
 Plus a little joy. 
 You think he'll do it, though? 
 What? 
 Take another kid. 
 They always do. 
 Ohh!
