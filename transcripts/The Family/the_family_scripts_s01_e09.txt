 Previously on "The Family"... 
 Eyes on the prize, champ. 
 Ah! 
 [Gasps] 
 How did you know this is the one I wanted? 
 I know you, Cruz. 
 Say hi to your boyfriend for me. 
 So what are we looking at? 
 Every night he gets on a bus and goes somewhere in this neighborhood. 
 Who the hell is he seeing at 2:00 a.m.? 
 I think you may be in danger. 
 You think Doug took that boy? 
 We'll talk in the car. 
 Let me get my purse. 
 Aah! 
 Man :  ...after a series of decade-old graphic texts emerged earlier today... 
 What? 
 .. romantically linking... Warren's husband to Nina Meyer... Claire : What did you do? Is his name Ben? No, it's not him! It is not your brother! Mom, please. I am not your mom. Monkey survived his spin in the dryer. Thanks for coming by. I know it's been a while. I stand by my work. Gabe :  Well, kid, here we are... in the suck. I was pretty pumped to solve that case with you, but where I am now, I won't be much help. [Ringing] Good news is, you know more than you think. [Ringing] [Cellphone rings] You know they'll get rid of the evidence first. You know they're probably hiding in plain sight. Oh! [Breathing heavily] Bad news is, you don't know the most important thing. Gabe on voicemail :  It's Clements. Call you back. [Beep] Get out of bed and come to work, would you? Gabe :  I'm already gone. Catherine :  This is Dr. Catherine Santoro. Adam Warren, session eight, code number 6433. Catherine :  Morning, Adam. Anything you want to talk about today? No. I think it would help. Tell me what you did down there when you woke up each day. I ate breakfast. Okay. Good. Then what? We had school. "We"? I mean me. You said "we." I had school. I read books. Adam, you were alone for 10 years. It's perfectly normal that you'd create a companion in your mind. Is that what you did? Yeah. Can you tell me more about your friend? Does he have a name? Ben. Where did Ben come from? Nowhere. Does he have a family like you? He has nothing. What do you mean? [Breathes deeply] They just moved him around all the time. Like a foster kid? It makes sense that you would create someone who's had a very different life than you. Is Ben still with you now? No. Do you miss talking to him? No. He got you through a very traumatic experience, so it makes sense if you... I never want to see him again. ♪♪ [Keyboard clacking] [Sighs] Do you ever sleep? I'll sleep when I'm in the governor's mansion. Coffee? In the pot. You need the Wi-Fi? I assume you're Pretty Fly for a Wi-Fi. Otherwise, your neighbor is using your phone number as his password, and you should move. You are way too together to be in my bed. I'm not always together. Like when? [Sighs] Now. Because I'm a girl? Because you're a human. [Cellphone buzzes] Ugh. What? Are you... That meeting wasn't on my calendar. I didn't see it. Uh, no, I-I can't right now. Of course I'm at home. Uh, yeah. Mom, I'll be right there! Just calm down! Listen, I'm telling you this 'cause I trust you not to say anything, but she's been in rough shape since Dad's affair came out. Yeah, we're... we're running out of Kleenex here, so I'm trying to get her head in the game for the debate. You'll just have to handle this one without me. Yes, you can. Yes, you... Ryan, grow a pair. [Sighs] What? That was a really good lie. [Chuckles] I'm a really good liar. John : What's all that? I'm getting rid of it. Even monkey? I'm not a little kid anymore. Copy that. Oh. Late night? Willa : Early morning. Oh? Did you go to church? No. Oh, maybe you should. I bet God has a lot to say to you. What's your problem? I'm just enjoying the irony. Why don't you focus on yourself instead? You've got to step all this business up a notch tonight. All of it. No surprises. A buzzed Danny is still a drunk Danny. And wear a proper suit. Not your jean tuxedo. Touchy. [Sighs] Let's talk about Dad's affair. [Snickers] Wow. We can't ignore it. It's all over the news. Thanks to you. The overnight polls show women voters are loving it, as I predicted. Their husbands all cheat, so they're with you. But it's still important we show a united front tonight. When the debate ends, you'll be at Mom's side, contrite but adoring. Bill and Hillary, John and Jackie. We're not reinventing the wheel here. You'll hold hands onstage. You'll have your moment. And then the rest of us will join, Adam in the middle. This is our chance to remind voters that Claire Warren represents strong family values. Represent. Well, here's the bad news. The pipe under the sink's been leaking. It, uh, rotted out the wood under the drawer tracks. Okay. And then the hinges rusted over on the kitchen cabinet, so we'll have to replace those, too. What's the good news? I can probably get it done today. Wow. That's great. I like to work fast. [Engine starts] I'll uh,... I'll write it up. [Vehicle approaching] ♪♪ [Indistinct conversations] Hi. You came. Hi. Look. I got the mast up. We can't be friends anymore, Adam. Why? I'm a lot older than you. So? So you should... play with kids your own age. But you said we could build a model airplane next. You promised. Friends should want what's best for each other, right? What I want... isn't the best for you. Here. Go get yourself some ice cream. Go on. [Whistling] Hey, what is that? [Dog barking] Come on. What's that? Hey. Hey, question about the Warren case. Yeah? Did he wrap it before he tapped it? Bite me. So, that's your type... Mr. Sad Dad? My type's pretty much anyone but you. I'm easy like that. Parker. Parker : Yeah? I need you to run the addresses on 100 North 45th Street between Austin and Pine. What are you looking for in that area? Foster home. Sure. Thank you. [Elevator bell dings] I'm an idiot. Could be. But we got our best circulation numbers to date for that affair trash. I had the biggest story of my career, and I dropped it. What do you mean? Willa Warren is a liar. She is a pathological, manipulative, lying liar who lies for a living. That's funny. So? So I bought it. I had a negative paternity test on the kid, and I still bought her lame, half-assed excuse. And somehow landed a better story. What's better than Adam Warren isn't Adam Warren? That his older sister is in on it. Gabe :  It's Clements. Call you back. [Beep] Now  you take a day off? Come on, Clements. Call me back. [Knock on door] You remember a kid named Ben? How long have you been a foster parent? Man : Oh, about 20 years. [Children crying in distance] That's dedication. Well, it's rewarding. Pays the bills, too. I'm not sure how I can help you. Tell me about Ben. Oh, he was here 8, maybe 10 years ago. Was he adopted? I don't know. Did they move him to another home? I don't know. So, what happened to him? I have so many coming and going over the years, I-I-I really couldn't say. Ah. The legal limit is four kids per home. I count eight cups on the table. There's no smoke detector, no fire extinguisher. There's rat traps under your sofa, and there's an open bottle of bleach on the counter. Not the smartest of ideas at any age, but actually illegal in a foster situation with children under the age of 2... of which I'm guessing from the screaming and crying upstairs you've got more than a few of. Also a pretty serious department violation. What are you doing? Calling Social Services. He was 8 or 9. He ran off one day and disappeared. There's no report on him. I didn't want to lose my license. Even if I had reported it, it wouldn't have mattered. There's very little follow-up in the system. You know that. Yeah, I do. So you won't make the call, then? I did before I came. I want to take Adam back to the day he was kidnapped. Why? We have a very promising lead, but the more details he can fill in for us, the better. He was 8 years old. How do you expect him to remember one day? Traumatic events usually stay with you. Which is why we should wait and have his shrink here. No, it needs to be now. We're closing in on this guy, and he knows it. Ben : I'm ready. I can remember. Nina : Great. We'll start off nice and easy, okay? What were you wearing at the rally? My mom's campaign T-shirt. What else? Blue shirt underneath, long-sleeved; brown pants. What about underwear or socks? How does that help your case? It's the details. We're trying to unlock his memory. With his underwear? They had cars on them. That's right. Okay. Um, I'm gonna show you a... few images we have on file from that day. Just, um... if you bring anything else up, okay? Soldani's Pizza. We had it for dinner. We always got the pepperoni and pineapple. [Chuckles] That's Alex. She was in his 3rd-grade class. I used to babysit her. Let's give Adam a chance to answer. She was there. I-I remember her. What about this one? Do you recognize him? Adam? I think that's enough. Let Adam answer the question. He clearly doesn't know him. Do  you? Claire : Stop it! Who is he? I said it's enough. 'Cause he kind of looks a lot... Stop it. What the hell is going on here? Thank you for your time, Adam. [Door closes, footsteps approaching] She might not know. She knows. Even if she does, she can't prove it. She can't even say it out loud. Not with a positive DNA test, which we have. God, what are we doing? We are putting our family back together. No, no. We are lying to the police, your father, and the entire world. I will handle this, all right? Oh, God. Have you seen the way that your dad looks at him? He's the sun, the moon, the stars. Just concentrate on the debate tonight, and everything will be okay. No, it is not okay. It is fraud on a level so massive... Mom. And... and I'm not even sure if he's worth it. How can you say that? How can I not? I don't know anything about him. I don't know where he comes from. I don't know his last name. I don't even know if he likes what I make him for breakfast. This person that you have brought into our house is... He is living in Adam's room, he is sleeping in Adam's bed, he is throwing away all of Adam's things, and I don't even know who he is. Mom. Tell me who he is. He's Adam's friend. That's not good enough. 
 
 [Rock music plays] [Chuckles] Really? Can't a girl buy a guy a drink? Mm. The girl who trashed my entire family to the world? Why not? [Sighs] Wow. You clean up good. I'm supposed to be at the debate. Oh, right. Yeah, that's a big deal. Yeah. To some people. Hey, can you tell your mom when she's governor that I have a really big pothole on my street? I am sure that she will make that a priority. So, why are you bailing on this thing? I don't know. Behind every great politician stands a great family, right? Right. When I'm not there. Our nation was created by rejects. So, how's your boyfriend? People disappoint. Yeah. Ben : Hello? You look nice. Thanks. But I think it might be better if you stayed at home tonight. [Sighs] Why? She's having a hard time with it. She... she just needs to get used to you. What if she doesn't ever get used to me? I'll leave you some money for pizza, okay? Hey. Didn't you live here with your mom when I was working here 10 years ago? Yes. Oh. How is she? Not well. She's dead. Oh, I'm sorry to hear that. She seemed like a nice lady. She was. Well, I hope you got to spend some quality time with her before she passed. I was away. How much is all this gonna cost? I'll do it for free. What? Well... 10 years of faulty cabinets... Yeah, but that's not your fault. I feel like I owe you. Okay. Thanks. I'll be right back. [Door opens] ♪♪ [Indistinct conversations] Mood ring for your girlfriend? No, thanks. The guy's in the bathroom or something. Will he be back soon? Well, he's been gone for a while. He sells those birdhouses for $10. I can take it if you want. Have a good day. Hi, there. Just sold another. Oh, yeah. Woman : I should get a cut. I'm your lucky charm. [Chuckles] You really are. Quality Woodworks! Come on over. ♪♪ Announcer : Welcome to the first gubernatorial debate of the 2016 election. Coming live to you from the Augusta Performing Arts Center. Four years ago, the state of Maine was in a state of crisis. But I rolled up my sleeves and got to work. During my tenure, I balanced the budget, pulled us out of a terrible recession, reduced class size in schools. We have come a long way. But we still have a long way to go. Mayor Warren, your opening statement? You'll have one minute. Well, I'm gonna go out on a limb here and say I completely agree with Governor Lang on that last part. Um... Is the debate over? Can I take off these heels yet? [Laughter] Uh, he's right. We do have to do better, but we can't do it under his leadership. Four years is a long road, Governor. I get it. But you've fallen asleep at the wheel, and good American families are struggling. They are hurting. And when they hurt, we all do. [Applause] Strong family values are the foundation of everything we're talking about tonight. I know I would not be standing here if it weren't for the values my parents instilled in me, and I can only hope that I have done the same for my own children. [Breathing heavily] I know that I am not the only mother out there who is sick and tired of our elected leaders making it harder for me to protect my family. 10 seconds, Mayor Warren. Making it harder for us to keep our children safe, to provide them with, uh... Doug : All right, Mr. Asher. Just sign here, and you're all set. Charlie :  Here we go. Ah. That's your neighbor, right? The mayor? Hank : Yeah. Let's go. Who you voting for? The other guy. And let's talk about how crime in her own city has actually increased 18%... Thank you. Thank you. ...under her leadership. Claire :  Yes, because I tripled the budget of our police force. So they're arresting more offenders, and the result is, my city is a safer place to live. [Doorbell rings] Pepperoni pineapple. Thanks. Bottom line... You're a one issue candidate. Your son was kidnapped. A terrible thing happened to you. But since when does that qualify you to govern a state? People who have experienced tragedy deserve our sympathy. They deserve our understanding. But they do not automatically deserve our votes. You have my understanding. You have my sympathy. But what you do not have is the experience to do my job. [Applause] In all due respect, I think it's a real disservice to all those other people out there who've experienced loss to use your son as a political prop in this campaign. Oh, no, no. Y-Y-You can just stop right there. You have not met a tragedy you couldn't use, Claire. Your son was taken, you ran for mayor. You got him back, and now you want us to make you governor. To be clear, Governor, I did not get my son back. [Audience murmuring] He says he is. The world believes he is. A blood test proved he is. But he's not my son. My son was taken at 8 years old. He was a little boy who loved the ocean, baseball, his family. That boy is gone. He is never coming back. There is a stranger in his place that I don't know at all, and somehow, I have to learn to accept that. I hope I can. And... and you are right, Governor... My political career has been shaped by my experiences, We stand here, and we pretend that we are debating... ♪♪ [Door creaking] ...vote for me because I was a... I want people to vote for me because I am a woman in power who has seen discrimination firsthand. And, yes, I want people to vote for me because my son was taken from us. That means everything in my power to enact laws to keep us safe. It makes sense that you wouldn't want to acknowledge that our experiences make us who we are, Governor, because you've spent the last four years in a expensive suit sitting in a mansion, looking down on people with actual problems, which your policies have handed us. But we know who you are, and I think we're ready for a change. Next question. ♪♪ Hey, Ben. [Breathing heavily] Time to have a talk. Willa : The room was dead silent, and then the people who are supposed to tell the media had nothing to say. That should tell you... you creamed him. You... you wiped the floor with him. Oh. You made him cry for his mommy. You actually had me feeling sorry for him. Would you please make her stop? It's like the 49ers versus the Broncos in Super Bowl XXIV. [Laughs] I don't even know what that means. It means you won. No, I stumbled on education. It is over. I know I could have hit him so much harder on job growth. I-I... You were great. You should have come with us, bud. We missed you. It's okay. I saw it all from here. I thought it made a lot of sense, what you said. Are you okay? Yeah. Just tired. You sure? There's pizza in the fridge. Pepperoni and pineapple. Catherine :  This is Dr. Catherine Santoro. Adam Warren, Session 10, code number 64386. [Knock on door] How are you feeling today, Adam? [Keyboard clacks] [Chuckles] The work wife. He said you were uptight, but he didn't mention pretty. Do I know you? Uh, Jonah Clements, Gabe's husband. Hi. [Chuckling] Hi. Is he here? No. Mnh-mnh. Is he out working a case? Oh, he didn't come home last night? I assumed he was with you. Agent Clements was last heard from 36 hours ago. He's had no communication with the Bureau, his husband, or family. There's been no bank or credit-card activity since yesterday afternoon. I want a BOLO put out on his car immediately. Triangulate his cellphone. Once we get his last-known location, let's question anyone and everyone he was in contact with. This takes top priority, people, and I want hourly updates. Let's move! Now! Nina. He's probably somewhere sleeping it off. No, he doesn't do that. How do you know? Because I know him. What's your name? Ben. Your full name. Ben Murphy. Irish? My grandpa... I think. Where were you born? Minnesota. I've never been. It's cold. Big city? Little. Do you like tacos? I've been making them at least once a week because they were Adam's favorite, but... I don't know... do you like them? Tacos? Yeah. Good. No. [Chuckles] They're too spicy the way you make them. Oh. Claire... ...I'm sorry I'm not him. You don't have to call me Claire. You don't have to spy on me. [Sighs] ♪♪ Didn't you live here with your mom when I was working here 10 years ago? I'll do it for free. I feel like I owe you. Well, he's been gone for a while. ♪♪ Willa : Rough night? What... what? Where were you? Out. With who? Friend. Well, Mom killed it. Pretty much every outlet is saying she won. Nice. Um... I-I-I messed up. I'm sorry. For what? For... the debate. You're absolved. ♪♪ [Indistinct conversations] Help you with something? I'd like to speak with Detective Meyer. She's out. Want to leave a message? I'll wait. Could be a long one. It's worth it. Woman :  You have three new messages. [Beep] Gabe :  Think I get the bar thing now, kid. No time to eat on this job. Fill you in later. [Beep] Maybe there's something that would help. Okay. We'll scan his files. Can you take this, please? So, he... he didn't mention where he was going? I should have come to you sooner, but I know the job. I know the hours that you guys work. Didn't even occur to me that... Just hang in there, all right? We're gonna bring him home. Okay? [Cellphone beeps] Think I get the bar thing now, kid. No time to eat on this job. Fill you in later. [Door creaking] I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry. [Sighs] Sorry. I'm so sorry. Oh, yeah. I'm sorry. I am so sorry. Willa : Cinched the governorship, and your first move is to pull out Betty Crocker? [Chuckles] It's his birthday next week. Not Adam's. His. Just want to make him something special. You're a good person, Mom. [Chuckles] No, I'm not. You are. Well... I'll spend the rest of my life wishing that he was the one that got sick down there. So... the least I can do is bake him a cake. ♪♪ How did he die? What? You said he was trying to escape or something, and then he fell and hit his head. So? So you told her he got sick. Why are you so upset? Which is it? Did he hit his head, or did he get sick? Both. What? He fell and hit his head. Then he got sick. He was sweating, and he was burning up, and I couldn't do anything. Okay? Okay. It's cold out here. Catherine :  What's wrong? Adam? Why can't they swim together? My fish? Why do they have to be separated like that? They're both boys. They can't be confined together. Why? One of them would kill the other. Adam? Should we begin? Yes.
