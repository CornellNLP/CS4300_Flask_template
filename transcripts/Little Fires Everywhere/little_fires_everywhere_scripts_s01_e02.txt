 Rent is $300 a month, water and power included. 
 ‐ You rented to a homeless person. 
 Did you even have time to check her references? 
 ‐ You know, I've been meaning to hire someone for my house. 
 Just to do a little light cleaning. 
 ‐ Yeah, I don't do that. 
 ‐ Moody. ‐ Pearl. 
 ‐ This was a mistake. We should go. ‐ What? 
 I‐I'm tired of, of moving around, of going wherever you want to go whenever you want to go there. 
 ‐ I'd like to help you in your household if the offer still stands. 
 ‐ Sure. 
 I was calling about your former tenant, Mia Warren. 
 I've never met a Mia Warren in my life. 
 ‐ Oh, hi, sweet Pearl. 
 You got to go. 
 Hi, beautiful. Did you have a good sleep? 
 Yeah, yeah? Come here. 
 Hi, hi, what? It's okay. 
 Yeah. 
 ‐ All right. 
 Thank you. ‐ Mm‐hmm. Of course. 
 ‐ Not just for this. 
 For letting us stay. 
 ‐ Mwah. Come on. 
 ‐ 7:30, time to get this show on the road. 
 Honey, your coffee. Thank you. 
 ‐ Lunches. 
 Where's your sister? 
 ‐ Your guess is as good as mine. 
 ‐ Isabelle. First day of school photo. Everybody outside. 
 ‐ Can we hurry, please? I won't get a spot on the Oval. 
 ‐ Yes, let me just smooth out the back, okay? 
 ‐ Does it look okay? ‐ Oh, it looks gorgeous. 
 You ready? Trip, what are you doing? Stop. 
 Do you want me to kick you? Isabelle, hurry up! 
 ‐ Boys, take it outside. Trip! 
 Stop, Trip, put me down. ‐ Have you spoken with her yet? 
 ‐ I‐I‐I will, honey. ‐ Today's her first day, right? 
 ‐ Yes. ‐ We can't have somebody working here with an illegitimate reference, 'cause the next thing you know, she's gonna slip and fall her way into a lawsuit. 
 ‐ I know, I said I would talk to her first thing, and I will. 
 ‐ Izzy, it's time to go. 
 ‐ I'll see you tonight? ‐ Uh‐huh. 
 ‐ I'm probably just gonna go to Moody's after school. 
 ‐ Yeah, I'm actually gonna see you there because I'm doing some work for his family. 
 ‐ What? 
 What do you mean? What‐‐ what kind of work? 
 ‐ Well, we're actually figuring it out. 
 But I don't want you to be late. 
 Your first day of school. 
 ‐ O‐okay. 
 ‐ Love you. 
 ‐ Love you, too. 
 Okay, everybody get together. One, two, three. Big smiles. 
 Everybody pretend you like each other. 
 Big smiles, Isabelle. 
 ‐ You're making this take forever. 
 ‐ You look like you're at an execution, honey. 
 ‐ Yeah, that would be way easier. 
 ‐ What? What is the matter? What's the attitude? 
 Hey. 
 ‐ I don't want to go. 
 ‐ Oh, honey, it's gonna be okay. 
 Your brothers and sister, they thrive there. 
 ‐ How do you know? Hi, Pearl, hi. 
 ‐ Hi. ‐ What if I don't, Mom? 
 ‐ You will, you will, I promise. Just one picture. 
 Everybody. Moody, put your arm around her. Cheer her up a little bit. 
 Okay, here we go. One, two, three. 
 Everybody just smile quick. 
 ‐ All right, and Pearl, pop in for one. Mom. 
 ‐ Oh, no, I don't have to. ‐ Come on. 
 Get between the boys. 
 ‐ Okay. Right in there in the middle. 
 Get right in there, perfect. I want to see joy on three, okay? 
 One, two, three. Joy. 
 ‐ Ready? 
 ‐ Yeah. 
 ‐ New computer lab. Everybody's excited. It's got dial‐up. 
 ‐ Wait, really? ‐ Yeah. 
 Uh, there's a batting cage in the gym. 
 Uh, cafeteria's upstairs. ‐ Got it. 
 ‐ We have an awesome planetarium. ‐ Wait, there's a planetarium? 
 ‐ Yeah. 
 See you guys. Okay, bye. 
 ‐ How long have they been going out? 
 ‐ Long enough for Lexie to have their wedding planned. 
 ‐ And I know this is a lot. You don't have to remember everything. 
 We basically have all our classes together, so... 
 you okay? 
 ‐ Yeah, yeah, I, um, I just remembered that I have to stop by the guidance office. 
 ‐ All right. 
 ‐ Do you know what my mom is doing at your house? 
 ‐ Have you ever heard of a house manager? 
 ‐ No. 
 ‐ Me neither. 
 You could do the shopping and the cooking. 
 Deal with any spare dishes that‐‐ that come up. 
 ‐ I can definitely do the shopping and the meals. 
 ‐ Great, um, we also host a lot of events. 
 I like to have fundraisers at the house. 
 Sometimes Bill's colleagues come over. 
 Oh, tomorrow night, I'm having a book club. 
 Oh, that would be so helpful if you could help me put out the food and, and the drinks and then, maybe stay and replenish as‐‐ as the party goes on. 
 I'd actually pay you extra if you would read the book for me. 
 I'm just teasing. It's, um, it's not even really a book. 
 It's a play. 
 It's worse than a play. It's monologues. 
 None of this group of women wants to talk about people's private areas, having a conversation. 
 Except for my friend who chose the book because, I mean, she's a gynecologist. 
 But you'd think after talking about them all day, you would think that she wouldn't want to discuss‐‐ 
 ‐ Anything else? 
 ‐ Um... 
 yes, uh... 
 actually, no, I‐I think that's, that's all. 
 ‐ Okay, then I'll see you this afternoon. 
 ‐ What, wait, this afternoon? You‐‐ you can't start now? 
 ‐ Mornings are when I do my best work creatively and I have those three nights at Lucky Palace, so. 
 Afternoons are my window. 
 ‐ I just hate the idea of dirty dishes sitting around all day. 
 ‐ If I don't prioritize my art, I don't complete anything. 
 And it's the bulk of my income. 
 ‐ Oh, oh. 
 Well, we'll try it and see. ‐ Okay. 
 I will see you in a few hours. 
 Let me know if you have any requests for dinner. 
 ‐ Thank you. 
 Why didn't I just... 
 ‐ I, I talked to someone about this over the summer, but they said I had to work it out in person. 
 I've already taken Geometry, so I‐I wanted to see about Algebra 2. 
 ‐ You know, when kids commute here from Cleveland, they often think they can handle more than they can. 
 ‐ I live in Shaker. 
 ‐ Let's see here. 
 This is your third high school and you're only a sophomore? 
 ‐ Mm‐hmm. We move around a lot. 
 ‐ Ah. Army brat? 
 ‐ No. No, my mom's an artist. 
 ‐ What does your dad do? 
 Look, Shaker isn't like your other schools. 
 You need a lot of support at home. 
 Better to succeed in a regular level course than to fall behind in an advanced one. 
 ‐ But I've already taken it. ‐ Mm, parts of it. Different schools. 
 Now, can I help you with anything else? 
 Uh, subsidized lunch forms? 
 ‐ Yeah. 
 Yeah, I need the forms. ‐ Okay. 
 Is something burning? 
 Oh. Sorry, I‐I knocked. 
 ‐ Can I help you? 
 ‐ Yes, I forgot to give you the keys to the house and um, money for the groceries. 
 ‐ Okay. ‐ Okay. 
 Um, I‐the place looks great. 
 Actually, the reason that I came by was because I called the person that you listed as your previous landlord, and strangely, he didn't seem to know you. 
 ‐ Huh. 
 Well, the numbers must have gotten mixed up. 
 ‐ Well, um, I would really appreciate it if you could get me the un‐mixed up numbers. 
 ‐ Yeah, no problem. 
 ‐ Wonderful. Well, I'll let you get back to work. 
 ‐ Okay. ‐ Oh, um... 
 I was thinking brisket tonight. 
 It's just easy. 
 I'll see you later. 
 ‐ f*ck. 
 ‐ Ugh, stop. Please, stop. 
 Jessica, are you deliberately trying to sabotage this orchestra? 
 Izzy, show her how it's done. 
 Stand up. 
 ‐ Oh, sh1t, Ellen's coming out again. 
 ‐ Richardson, line three. 
 ‐ Thank you. Elena Richardson. 
 ‐ Hi, this is David Carter. I'm calling regarding Mia Warren. 
 ‐ Oh, um, I'm sorry. I wasn't expecting your call, I‐‐ 
 ‐ Mia was great. Model tenant. 
 Barely knew she was there. 
 Those are the best ones, right? 
 ‐ Right, um, yes. 
 Were there any, um, red flags in your mind? 
 ‐ Not a one. Never late with her rent. 
 Left the place cleaner than when I rented it to her. 
 She and her daughter were delightful. 
 ‐ Okay, well, um... 
 Thank you, Mr. Carter. I‐I appreciate your time. 
 ‐ Sure thing. Take care. 
 ‐ Okay, I, I will. Bye‐bye. 
 ‐ Thanks. 
 ‐ You don't talk much, but you got layers. 
 ‐ What's going on with her? 
 ‐ Uh, she barely speaks English. ‐ You don't speak Chinese. 
 ‐ Dude, that sh1t's Mandarin. 
 ‐ It's just weird doodling. 
 ‐ I love weird. 
 Mm. 
 Thanks. Yeah. 
 I like to make that for Pearl when she's having a hard day. 
 ‐ Who said it was hard? 
 Seen the psycho calendar yet? 
 ‐ It's hard to miss. 
 So how bad was it? 
 ‐ Bad. 
 Full of f*cking bullies. 
 You know, Fiona Apple's right. 
 "The world is bullshit." 
 ‐ Can you give me some of those? 
 So who said you have to sit back and take it? 
 If you don't stand up for yourself, who will? 
 Thanks again. ‐ Yeah, no problem. 
 Hey. Hey. 
 ‐ Hi. ‐ How was it? 
 ‐ Good. 
 I mean, it was, yeah. It was fine. 
 We were just gonna hang out. 
 Watch TV or something. Right, Moody? 
 ‐ Yeah. ‐ We'll leave in about an hour. 
 Want some pretzels? 
 You gonna join them? Move. 
 No. 
 I'm sorry, Bill, but the whole thing was just strange. 
 I‐I mean, he was singing her praises. He called her delightful. 
 ‐ Well, that's a good thing, isn't it? 
 Hey, are you gonna pick up the dry cleaning? 
 ‐ And Mia was supposed to get me his number, but he called me. 
 Mm‐hmm, uh, because I really need that blue button down. 
 The Brooks Brothers. 
 ‐ I‐I I'm sorry, she's just not delightful. 
 Anyone who has met her would not describe her as delightful. 
 ‐ Hon, look, you're allowed to change your mind. 
 If you don't want her there... 
 ‐ Bill, it's not that I don't want her there. 
 I just, I want to feel...good about it. 
 ‐ Okay. But you are gonna pick up the dry cleaning, right? 
 Hello? 
 I'm home. 
 Hey, guys. 
 Oh, hi. ‐ Hey. 
 ‐ Mia. ‐ Mm‐hmm. 
 ‐ I'm Bill. 
 ‐ Hey. The meatloaf is almost done. 
 It's got about 45 minutes, but I set the timer. 
 ‐ Did you put Ritz crackers in the meatloaf? 
 ‐ I did. ‐ Wow. 
 I haven't seen that in probably 20 years. 
 Elena is strictly bread crumbs. 
 ‐ It's how my mother made it. 
 ‐ Mine, too. 
 Well, it is great to meet you, and to finally, you know, put a... 
 um... it's nice to finally meet you. 
 ‐ Likewise. 
 Hey, Pearl, let's go. 
 ‐ Bye. ‐ Bye. 
 ‐ Yes, honey. Lexie, it's fine. I'm gonna leave the office in a few. 
 Yeah, tell‐tell your father to go ahead and start dinner without me. 
 All right, honey, I have to go. Bye. 
 Lou! 
 Lou. 
 I was hoping I would catch you. 
 ‐ Oh, no, this looks dangerous. ‐ Only if you eat them all in one sitting. 
 Make sure and share them with Marnie and the kids, okay? 
 ‐ What do you need? 
 ‐ I need a criminal background check. 
 And if we could keep it discreet, that would be great. 
 ‐ For a story? ‐ Possibly down the line. 
 Thank you, you're the best. Her name is Mia Warren. 
 ‐ Hi, everyone. 
 I'm so sorry I'm late. I just got caught up at work. 
 Meatloaf. Mm. 
 Hm. It's so good. 
 ‐ Yeah, and no pigs were slaughtered. 
 ‐ So, first day of school. Any headlines? 
 ‐ It was fine. ‐ Pearl liked it. 
 Well, I got a ton of compliments on my outfit. 
 Thank you, by the way, for telling me to break in my Steve Madden's. 
 I didn't get any blisters. 
 Good. ‐ How about you, Izzy? How was your first day? 
 ‐ You know. 
 Oh, I think I figured out what I'm gonna do for my Yale essay. 
 It has to be about some kind of hardship that I've overcome, so I decided that I'm going to write about South Pacific. 
 ‐ The musical? What about it? 
 ‐ How I killed myself for that audition and didn't get Nellie. 
 But I still gave it my all in the stupid chorus. 
 ‐ I remember that, honey. It was very political. 
 You know, I, for one, have a real issue with this Yale essay topic. 
 You know, your father and I have worked very hard your entire life to prevent you from having any hardship. 
 And now, you have to just go and try and drum one up. 
 ‐ I would expect Yale to come up with a better question. 
 Right? I mean, it is Yale, after all. ‐ That's right, exactly. 
 I mean, I‐I feel like they're sort of saying if you're not raised by a crack‐addicted mother who can barely make ends meet, you, what? Do you get punished for it? That seems silly. 
 ‐ I don't think there's a lot of crack addict's daughters applying to Yale. 
 ‐ Exactly. That's my point, Moody. I mean, and then, why put on some sort of farce? 
 They’re‐they're gonna punish you because you have good parents who have made good choices on your behalf. 
 Oh, my goodness. ‐ It's the Ritz crackers. 
 There are Ritz crackers in this? 
 Son. Yeah. 
 Yeah. Right? 
 Yeah. ‐ It is very good, mm‐hmm. 
 ‐ Not as refined as yours. 
 ‐ Thank you. 
 ‐ Everything's okay? 
 ‐ Yeah. Yes. 
 ‐ Everything's great. 
 ‐ No, it's not. The food here is terrible. 
 The fake Chinese. 
 ‐ I am surprised you chose this place. 
 ‐ It's free, right? ‐ Yeah. 
 ‐ I figured that if we save money, you won't have to work as much. 
 ‐ How are your classes? 
 ‐ They're making me retake Geometry. 
 My counselor won't let me switch to Algebra 2. 
 ‐ What? ‐ Yeah. 
 I mean, he assumed that I was from Cleveland. 
 And on top of that, he was acting like I wasn't even smart enough to be in the class that I'm clearly supposed to be in based off of my transcript. 
 I mean, isn't that ridiculous? 
 ‐ I remember when you were that age. 
 ‐ Did you hear what I just said? 
 ‐ Yes, Pearl. 
 Ask for a placement test. 
 You know how to advocate for yourself. ‐ I tried. 
 ‐ And? ‐ He said that we moved around too much. 
 That the schools I've been to are unlike the ones here in Shaker. 
 Mom, are you even listening to me? ‐ Yes. 
 This counselor has no idea what you're capable of. 
 If anyone has the ability to excel anywhere, it's you. 
 Give me a minute. 
 ‐ Why are you crying? 
 Bebe, what just happened? 
 ‐ I have to go back to work. 
 ‐ No, you don't. Give me your apron. 
 I'll finish your shift. 
 Go home. 
 ‐ Okay, Buffy not recording is not a 911. 
 And plus, it was a rerun anyway. It premieres next week. 
 I'm pretty sure it does. 
 Yeah. 
 Mom, we're out of SlimFast. Yes, I know. 
 I got the last one. I'll get more. 
 Okay. She doesn't want to be a slayer anymore, so... 
 ‐ Dude, what the hell? 
 ‐ Moody, your language. It's gotten so bad. 
 ‐ Did you not see what he just did? 
 ‐ Don't narc on me like that, man. Just stop fighting. 
 Are you eating Popsicle for breakfast? ‐ Yeah. 
 ‐ Ew, that looks wrong. Put that away. Well, you look wrong. 
 ‐ Good morning. 
 ‐ Oh, hi, Pearl. ‐ Hi, Mrs. Richardson. 
 ‐ Oh, just call me Elena. 
 ‐ Oh, yeah, sorry. Are you ready? 
 ‐ Um...yeah. 
 Elena? Mm‐hmm? 
 ‐ I was wondering if you'd mind reading this for me. 
 I'm having this thing with my counselor and I could use the help of a real writer. 
 ‐ Oh, so you want to change your math class. Yeah. 
 ‐ But we have math together. 
 ‐ This is complete bias. They do this to the Cleveland kids. 
 I just read an article about this in The Plain Dealer. 
 They try to discourage minorities from taking advanced courses. 
 ‐ It's true. I mean, half our school is black, but none of them are in my classes. 
 ‐ Maybe that should be your Yale essay. 
 Having to suffer through upsettingly all white APs. 
 ‐ Will you shut up? Will you shut up? 
 ‐ You know what, I'm gonna handle this. 
 ‐ Oh, no, you don't have to. ‐ Oh, I want to. 
 All right, I'm gonna go. If you need a ride, come on. 
 Ugh, Trip, clean up this mess. 
 ‐ Well, she's unleashed. 
 Let's go. ‐ All right. 
 ‐ Bebe. 
 ‐ Scott tell me your address. I hope it's okay. 
 ‐ Yeah. ‐ I just come here to bring over thank you for the other day. 
 I, I made some Chinese noodle for you. 
 It's not very spicy because I'm not sure if you can eat some spicy food. 
 ‐ Thank you. I'll get your tips. 
 ‐ Oh, no, no. No, you can keep them. I‐‐ 
 ‐ No. ‐ I just come here to thank you and explain what I was doing. 
 That day, why I was crying. 
 I... 
 I had a daughter. 
 And I miss her so much‐‐ ‐ No, no, no, it's okay. 
 Stop. 
 You don't have to explain it to me. 
 Here's your tips. 
 ‐ Thank you. 
 ‐ Yeah. 
 She wishes someone would come to her window. 
 ‐ Someone with boobs. 
 ‐ Would you guys just stop? 
 ‐ Jessica, really? 
 It's not enough to sabotage our playing. Now you have to destroy‐‐ 
 ‐ Would you just back the f*ck off? 
 You ever think she has more things to worry about than stupid Vivaldi? 
 ‐ Garrett, you were such a help, as always. 
 Um, so I can plan on you switching Pearl by tomorrow? 
 ‐ Yeah, I'll put the changes in now. 
 Hey, don't be a stranger. ‐ Thank you. 
 ‐ Mm‐hmm, all right. 
 ‐ Isabelle? 
 ‐ What am I supposed to do here? 
 ‐ You're gonna sit there and think about your shameful behavior. 
 None of it's acceptable. 
 Actually, finish this and tell me how it ends. 
 ‐ Oh, I didn't realize your daughter was here. 
 ‐ Oh, yes, she's a little under the weather, so I had to pick her up. 
 Has that fax come in? ‐ Oh, you know, I was gonna tell you. 
 Our fax is on the fritz again so I just had them send it to your house. 
 ‐ My house. 
 Yeah, otherwise, they're gonna mail it. 
 ‐ Okay, thank you. ‐ Mm‐hmm. Bye, dear. 
 What? ‐ Get your things. We need to go. 
 I‐‐ bring that with you, come on. 
 ‐ You can go straight upstairs. 
 No music except for violin and when your father gets home from the game, we'll decide how long you're grounded for. 
 Oh, my gosh, the table looks stunning. 
 ‐ Oh, good. ‐ Thank you for doing all of that. 
 I‐I thought I would be home earlier. 
 Um, do you mind running to the outdoor fridge? 
 The wine is out there. It's in the garage. 
 I just have to finish one thing for work really quick. 
 ‐ Sure. 
 ‐ Great, thank you. 
 Let's, shall we? Let's go sit down. 
 Does everybody have wine and something to eat? 
 All right, should we start? All right. 
 ‐ All right, the moment of truth. What did everyone think? 
 Oh, well. Hmm. 
 Oh, come on. I know that the tendency is to back away from anything that makes us uncomfortable. 
 But this book‐‐ ‐ It's a play. 
 ‐ It's a play. ‐ Really, it challenges us to look at our own womanhood. 
 You know, to examine the feminine experience. 
 ‐ Oh, lordy. Be it body images or s*x. 
 
 
 
 Clitoris. ‐ No 
, no, it's not usually like this. 
 Last month we read How Stella Got Her Groove Back. 
 You know what I think we should do? 
 Hey, hey, hey, hey. 
 Listen, I think that we should all go around the circle and each answer one of the questions that this book posits. 
 What do we think? Yeah? Okay. 
 If your v*g1n* could speak, what would it say? 
 ‐ Mine would love more wine. 
 A lot more. Elena? 
 ‐ No, I've already had my four ounces, unfortunately. 
 ‐ Well, Elena, since you are our illustrious host, why don't we start with you? 
 We're joking, Liz. Relax. ‐ No, I'm really, I'm really serious. 
 I want to know. 
 I'm curious to know what you think of the book. 
 ‐ Well, I thought the play was funny in certain parts, but I also found it a little bit rompy. 
 Rompy? 
 Well, what about the Bosnian rape victims? 
 ‐ Well, not that part, obviously. 
 You know what, I think that we should read that one out loud for those of you that haven't read the book. Oh, God, no, please. 
 Oh, God, no. No, no, no, no, no. 
 That traumatized me. ‐ Yes. 
 ‐ I can't do it again. ‐ Which is why I voted for Memoirs of a Geisha. 
 Less trauma and controversy. ‐ Yes. 
 ‐ But what's wrong with a little controversy if it elevates the conversation? 
 I mean, isn't that the point of even having a book club? 
 ‐ I'm sorry, but the term "coochie snorchers" isn't particularly elevating in my mind. 
 I was surprised, with all the mention of, you‐know‐what's‐‐ 
 ‐ Vaginas. 
 ‐ That there was very little discussion about motherhood. 
 ‐ Okay, there was that amazing piece at the end about childbirth. 
 ‐ Well, there was that, the one, but out of how many? 20? 
 ‐ Well, not everyone with a v*g1n* wants to be a mother. 
 ‐ Well, a lot of us do. 
 And we all came out of one, and it's a big event for a, you‐know. 
 And‐and the main reason we have a you‐know. 
 ‐ Um, well, I haven't had kids, so does that render my v*g1n* irrelevant? 
 I mean, what about Linda, for that matter? 
 ‐ We're not talking about Linda's experience. 
 I think that's a little personal. So what are you talking about then? 
 What, are you saying that my v*g1n* is just worth less than your v*g1n*? 
 ‐ You're getting very upset. 
 ‐ No, I think Elena's touching on something that speaks to the heart of the piece. 
 I mean, I‐I had the same thought when I read it, actually. 
 That, um, big events happen all the time to vaginas, but we as a society have a deep discomfort calling them by name, let alone regarding them with respect or actually seeing them. 
 ‐ Yeah, I don't think that's what Elena was saying at all. 
 ‐ I do. 
 I think Elena and... please correct me if I'm wrong. ‐ No, of course. 
 ‐ But I think Elena is talking about vaginas as a metaphor for our own discomfort with the parts of us that make us most uniquely and... primally who we are. 
 Have you really looked at your own? 
 ‐ ‐ Or has anyone here? 
 ‐ Oh... 
 ‐ I think that that is Elena's point. 
 How can we see ourselves when we're afraid to look at who we really are? 
 ‐ This is Mia, everyone. She's new to Shaker. 
 Hi, Mia. 
 That was really insightful. 
 Hey, I brought sustenance. 
 I'm sorry. ‐ No, no, no. 
 I'll tell her. Okay. 
 Bye, Anita. All right. 
 Sorry. ‐ No. 
 ‐ My mom's gallerist. 
 ‐ Stolen from book club. ‐ Oh? 
 ‐ Yeah, I swiped about 30 kinds of cheese and olives the size of your face. 
 ‐ Amazing. I love face olives. 
 ‐ Perfect. ‐ I'm so sick of Chinese food. 
 I can't even tell you. 
 ‐ You got a bunch of new stuff, huh? ‐ Oh, yeah. 
 ‐ Ooh, nice chair. ‐ Oh, thank you. That's my mom. 
 Ooh, grapes. 
 Well, you weren't kidding about these face‐sized olives. 
 ‐ Moody? 
 Moody? 
 You're not supposed to be in here. 
 I mean, I'm not even allowed. ‐ Sorry. 
 I'm‐I'm so sorry, uh... 
 ‐ Oh. 
 No, I mean, that's fine. 
 You just can't mess with her art or anything. 
 ‐ Your mom smokes? 
 ‐ When she works. 
 ‐ Have you ever? 
 Like, with your mom? ‐ No, trust me. 
 Um, she's cool, but not that cool. 
 You want to try? 
 ‐ Kind of. 
 ‐ Okay. 
 All right, cool. 
 Start sucking as soon as I light it. 
 But just little puffs, or you'll cough, okay? 
 ‐ Okay. 
 ‐ It was a surprisingly good book club despite you‐know‐who. 
 ‐ Okay, next time, we're picking a real book, or we're staging a coup. 
 ‐ I'm with you. ‐ All right. 
 ‐ Love you. ‐ Love you. 
 ‐ I'll call you later. ‐ Okay, bye. 
 Thank you for saving me in there. 
 ‐ Well, I, uh, I was happy to. 
 ‐ You really didn't have to stay this late. 
 ‐ I need to talk to you. 
 I saw your fax machine. The criminal record check. 
 ‐ Oh, okay. 
 Well, I feel terrible, but you were coming to work in the house, and I always trust my instincts. 
 ‐ I did lie. 
 I had to break my last lease because I couldn't find a month to month apartment. 
 So I put down a fake reference. 
 And when you called me on it, I made my boss at Lucky Palace call you. 
 I'm sorry. 
 I've never been arrested. 
 I'm not a criminal. 
 But a lot of landlords, when they see a single black mom, 
 they don't want to rent to me. 
 But you did. 
 Because you're different, and I should have seen that and just been honest. 
 So I understand if you're not comfortable having me work here anymore. 
 I do. 
 ‐ Why don't we have a glass of wine? 
 ‐ Okay. 
 I can't believe your mom listens to the Velvet Underground. 
 ‐ Do you feel high yet? 
 ‐ The room looks super clear. 
 Like... the edges of everything look like they're... shimmering. 
 Is that...is that normal? 
 ‐ I don't know. 
 ‐ Hey, is your mom gonna be super pissed if she finds out? 
 Uh, this won't be like the bikes, will it? 
 ‐ Nothing will ever be like the bikes. 
 All right, my turn. ‐ Okay. 
 ‐ All right. 
 ‐ I mean, either way, she's way more chill and, you know, laid back than my mom. 
 ‐ She hides stuff. 
 Just like everybody else. 
 ‐ Well, like what? 
 Why she does what she does. 
 Why we go where we go. 
 Who she sleeps with. 
 ‐ Who does she sleep with? 
 ‐ Whoever she wants, whenever she wants. 
 She says that, that s*x doesn't have to mean anything but s*x. 
 Okay. 
 ‐ My‐my parents, they have a schedule. 
 ‐ Wait, what? 
 ‐ Wednesdays and Saturdays. 
 Lexie told us. 
 Oh, I don't get it. ‐ Yeah? 
 Your mom seems like the kind of mom who's happy because you're happy. 
 ‐ Um, I'm pretty happy right now. 
 ‐ Me too. 
 ‐ I am so glad we‐we're doing this. 
 And I also really liked what you said about vaginas. 
 Because it's true. I'm not the most flexible person, but it does feel neglectful... that I've never seen mine. 
 ‐ Have you really never seen it? 
 ‐ No. ‐ Really? 
 ‐ No. 
 ‐ Huh. 
 ‐ Have you? ‐ I did a whole series on it in my 20's. 
 Like, 20 photos. 
 ‐ Photos? ‐ Yes. 
 ‐ That people saw? 
 ‐ Yes. 
 ‐ Oh, my goodness. 
 Oh, what, that photo that's over your fireplace? 
 ‐ What about it? ‐ Is it yours? 
 ‐ It is. 
 ‐ I couldn't tell if it was a woman, or, it felt very spider‐like. 
 How did you make it? 
 ‐ A friend helped me. 
 ‐ Oh. 
 It goes back to what we were talking about. 
 The parts of us that we're afraid to look at. 
 I wanted her to feel unrecognizable. 
 Almost monstrous. 
 Even to herself. 
 ‐ Do you think Pearl likes you? 
 ‐ I've never thought about it. 
 ‐ That's because she does. 
 And when your daughter doesn't, you think about it all the time. 
 I take motherhood for granted sometimes. 
 That they'll love you forever. 
 That they'll love you at all. 
 When they're little, they, they need you so much. 
 They hold you and grab for you and you cuddle them. 
 She used to burrow into me. 
 I was the thing she needed most in the world. 
 And then they grow up, and... 
 you don't get to hold them, touch them like that. 
 Even if you want to. 
 And it's like... learning to love the smell of an apple 
 when all you want to do is grab it and hold it. 
 Devour it. 
 Seeds and all. 
 And then, you realize it wasn't just that they needed you. 
 You needed them. 
 Ugh, this is why I only have four ounces. 
 ‐ That is exactly what it is like. 
 Seeds and all. 
 ‐ You've done a wonderful job with Pearl. 
 I mean, what kid advocates for harder classes? 
 That letter she wrote was wonderful. 
 She didn't need my help with it, but I was happy to give it. 
 Is the picture for sale? 
 I would love to buy it‐‐ ‐ No. 
 It's not. 
 ‐ Your art‐‐ ‐ It's really late, so... 
 I think I'm... 
 ‐ Oh, yeah, uh, of course. 
 Oh, my good‐‐ did we clean the kitchen? 
 ‐ Yeah, we did. ‐ Yes. 
 ‐ Yeah, oh. 
 ‐ I like to hug people. You should join our book club. 
 October is gonna be The Horse Whisperer. 
 And I think, um...maybe after that, we'll read Primary Colors. 
 And Mia, I just want to say thank you for everything. 
 ‐ Yeah. ‐ Really. 
 ‐ ‐ Okay. 
 Good night. ‐ Good night. 
 ‐ Oh, give my love to Pearl. ‐ Uh‐huh. 
 ‐ Ooh. 
 ‐ Hi. ‐ Hey. 
 What's that? 
 ‐ Kurt Cobain. 
 Courtesy of Moody. 
 ‐ Hey. 
 Were you able to fix your math class? 
 ‐ Yeah. 
 Yeah, I did what you said. 
 I took care of it myself. 
 Good night. 
 ‐ Good night. 
 ‐ Well, have fun without me. 
 There's another party tonight. 
 I don't think it's at the usual spot, dude. 
 I think it's down by the square. 
 Guess we're going. 
 Hey. 
 ‐ Oh, hey. 
 ‐ Cock mouth kill cock. 
 My mother used to say that. It's a Jamaican saying. 
 It means... what you say could kill you. 
 What was her name? 
 ‐ May Ling.
