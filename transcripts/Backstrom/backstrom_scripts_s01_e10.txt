 [Rain falling] 
 Backstrom : Beep, beep. 
 Move it or lose it, people. 
 Hey, Almond, how do I look? Camera ready? 
 Almond : Doesn't matter. 
 You're not talking to the press. 
 [Police radio chatter] 
 Ohh, rose garden. 
 My grandmother used to bring me here every summer. 
 To look at dead bodies? 
 Lieutenant Backstrom, Assistant District Attorney Steven Kines. We met at the... 
 I know who you are, heinz. Why are you here? 
 The homicide... mayor says it needs to be solved quickly before an important landmark is besmirched by a morbid mystery. 
 "Besmirched"? 
 Miss America and her mother-in-law are in town. 
 Wanted a tour of the rose garden. 
 Supposed to be a photo op. Now it's... 
 So, you work for the tourist board now. 
 I work for the mayor. 
 So do you. 
 So does everybody in your unit and the D.A.'s office. 
 So I'll need a briefing every morning... suspects, evidence, paperwork. 
 [Sighs] We don't need a babysitter. 
 We've already got Gravely. 
 Why is  he  here? 
 To solve a murder that could Sully the reputation of an entire city. 
 "Sully." [Chuckles] 
 "Sully." 
 You  don't solve murders. 
 I  solve murders. 
 Go back down to the courthouse. 
 Get your shoes shined by that Asian guy in the big chair. 
 What is with that kid? 
 He's an ass, but I wouldn't mind scoring a few political brownie points. 
 What do you think when you see Moto sniffing a rose? 
 That the rose is about to be eaten. 
 I take time to stop and smell the roses. 
 What's wrong with that? 
 That's why you're still in uniform. 
 Get back there and control the masses. 
 [Camera shutter clicks] 
 What do we got, Pete? 
 Niedermayer : Well, we found her I.D. in her purse. 
 Her name is Larissa Moscovitz, age 28. 
 Russian name, red nail polish... prostitute. 
 What? You did not just say that. 
 What? 
 Some of my favorite people in the world are hookers, ahead of bookies and barkeeps. 
 If it was up to me, no one would get away with killing a hooker. 
 Cause of death appears to be blunt-force trauma to the head. 
 Lividity suggests that she was killed last night between 6:00 and midnight. 
 Six hours? That's a big window. 
 Were there any witnesses? 
 Well, the park was open until 9:00, but no one has stepped up. 
 Who reported the body? 
 Mr. Norman Gilman there. 
 Oh. 
 How about that? 
 Shifty eyes, raggy beard, stonewashed jeans... the killer. 
 Sure, I recognize her. 
 Pretty button like that. 
 Came here all the time. 
 You talk to her? 
 Not really. She said hi once or twice. 
 Blood trail. 
 Let's just say I admired her from afar, her curvaciousness and so forth. 
 But when I saw her all laid out in the dirt like that, I thought, "that's bad," so I called the police. 
 Lieutenant! 
 We just found our murder weapon. 
 That your shovel, Norman? 
 Mostly mine. 
 Were you here last night? 
 Yeah. 
 Did you kill that woman with that shovel? 
 No! 
 Turn around. 
 Look, what if I say I-it's not my shovel? 
 No take-backs. 
 Open up the park! 
 Here we go, folks, enjoy the roses. 
 Bring on Miss America. 
 Gravely : Wait, hold on a second. 
 What? 
 Seriously? Based on what evidence? 
 The shovel that's covered in blood, plus the guy practically confessed. 
 Okay, by "practically," 
 I assume you mean he completely denied it. 
 Well... 
 Gravely, the guy is guilty of something, all right? 
 Did you see him? 
 Go with me on this. 
 The city wants a resolution. 
 Let's give them what they want. 
 Don't you want brownies? 
 Brownie  points. 
 Make way. Make way. 
 Back off. 
 Detective! 
 The rose garden killer has been caught. 
 [Indistinct shouting] 
 Sir. 
 You were right. 
 Larissa Moscovitz was arrested for solicitation eight years ago in Los Angeles. 
 Ah. 
 Ever since she moved to Portland, she's been totally clean. 
 She's employed as a life coach. 
 Life coach, hooker... same difference. 
 Pre-autopsy analysis determined she had recent sexual activity. 
 But remember, that doesn't mean she received payment for it. 
 Do you think that Norman Gilman really is the killer, or was that all for show? 
 What do you think, Niedermayer? 
 I don't know, or I wouldn't ask. 
 I don't know, either, but I'm about to find out. 
 Are you really going to stay here? 
 I'm the babysitter, remember? 
 Did you know the victim was a prostitute? 
 Ex-prostitute. [Scoffs] 
 That's what they all say. 
 For all we know, she was turning tricks  in  the rose garden. 
 This is a disaster. 
 All we know is that she was a human being who was brutally murdered in a public place. 
 The  public  part is the problem. 
 What's the matter? The mayor doesn't like prostitutes? 
 Not frequenting respectable tourist attractions, no. 
 Screw the mayor. He got his closure. 
 Now it's time to find the killer. 
 I was hoping we already did. 
 Gilman is a registered s*x offender. 
 That sounds good, right? 
 Shut up, Heinz. 
 Kines. 
 What's in the bag? 
 Contents of his pocket at the time of arrest. 
 Doesn't appear to be anything of interest. 
 [Police radio chatter] 
 Norman Wayne Gilman. 
 Two arrests for indecent exposure. 
 One conviction. 
 That puts you on the national s*x offender registry. 
 [Clears throat] 
 Why do pervs always have three names? 
 I'm not a perv. 
 Ah. 
 Want a stick? [Chuckles] 
 No. 
 'Cause who would want a stick of wet, sticky perv gum? 
 That indecency thing was a long time ago. 
 Old news. 
 Once a perv, always a perv. The Bible says so. 
 I've read the Bible cover to cover, and it does  not  say that. 
 Well, I know a pastor, so you're gonna have to prove it. 
 You know what a concordance is? 
 It's like an index of the Bible. 
 There's an app for that? 
 "Pervert" is in the Bible 21 times. 
 How about that? 
 Let's try "lust." 
 55 times. 
 Ah. 
 Looking up dirty words in the Bible... that's very suspicious. 
 I'm you. 
 I'm a... horny perv who reads the Bible to raise his holy rod. 
 But how do I feel about killing prostitutes? 
 Matthew 21. 
 "Tax collectors and the prostitutes are entering the kingdom of God ahead of you." 
 [Sniffs] 
 Nervous perv sweat. 
 What's this? 
 Moths. 
 Moths, huh? 
 Look at that. 
 A peephole pocket. 
 Proverbs 7:15. 
 That's all I have to say on the subject. 
 Perv. 
 Proverbs 7:15. 
 "Therefore came I forth to meet thee diligently to seek thy face." 
 Except it wasn't faces he was seeking. 
 It was boobies. Norman's not our guy. 
 Go take Moto. Search Larissa's apartment. 
 What? "Not our guy"? 
 How come? 
 Any perv who's satisfied with boobie pics doesn't kill prostitutes with shovels. 
 S01E10 
 Love Is a Rose and You Better Not Pick It 
 Okay, all these photos were taken by Norman Gilman's phone camera through a hole in his shirt pocket. 
 I surmise that his particular fetish is to bump into women and then take photos of the contact. 
 Mm, very sophomore juvenile. 
 Which is why Backstrom no longer believes that he's capable of murder. 
 Yeah, but still, these were taken on the day of the crime. 
 [Gasps] 
 Oh, perhaps we may find a photograph of the victim. 
 You know, that could help us narrow down the time of the attack. 
 Do you prefer very large breasts or smaller ones? 
 Uh... 
 I-I, uh... 
 You do not have to answer that. 
 [Door closes] 
 Moto : You know, this is a nice place for a prostitute. 
 Former  prostitute. 
 Oh, look at this... roses. 
 You know, I have stop and smell these, but probably be a waste of time. 
 [Sniffs] 
 Roses in the apartment, body found in the rose garden. 
 You think that's a coincidence? 
 Almond : What do you think? 
 I don't know, but what I do know is, if a woman sends you a single yellow rose, that means she caught you cheating on her. 
 [Chuckles] 
 Or she came up with that conclusion in an unfair manner. 
 You got a hunch? Follow it up. 
 It's the best way to move up the ladder. 
 Huh, this looks like an appointment. 
 4:00 p.m. on the day of the murder. 
 Could be the last person to see her alive. 
 [Scoffs] 
 Call girls are usually more discreet than that. 
 Life coaches! 
 Life coaches are usually more discreet than that. 
 And I keep forgetting that you're a pastor. 
 I'm sorry. 
 The name is Dmitri Green. 
 Detective Almond. Portland P.D. 
 And you are...? 
 This is, uh, my girlfriend. 
 Uh, I'm Claire McGrail. 
 Mm. I'm here on police business. 
 Perhaps we can talk without your girlfriend present. 
 Oh, I-I'm studying to be a paralegal. 
 I can serve as Dmitri's representation. 
 I need to ask you some questions about Larissa Moscovitz. 
 Sure. Yeah, okay. 
 Come on in. 
 Thank you. Excuse me. 
 Your friend from college? 
 Is... Larissa all right? 
 What's your relationship? 
 We understand Ms. Moscovitz works as a life coach. 
 Yeah. Yeah. In... in a way. 
 Has, uh, something happened? 
 Larissa Moscovitz was murdered. 
 She's dead? [Scoffs] 
 What do you know about that? 
 Nothing. 
 It's not... [Scoffs] It's not what it looks like. 
 I-I-it looks like something? What does it look like? 
 Dmitri. 
 It looks like I paid to have s*x with her. 
 It does? 
 And... why would it look like that? 
 Larissa is a...  Was  a-a s*x surrogate. 
 Ohh. s*x surrogate. 
 Yeah, it's kind of like a therapist, only... hands on. 
 Hands off! 
 I'd like you to come down to the station with me, talk to my lieutenant. Ms. McGrail. 
 What? 
 Would you mind joining us? 
 Uh, why? 
 I-in case I killed my boyfriend's prostitute? 
 Okay. Yeah. Why don't we go do that? 
 I didn't kill Larissa. 
 She was helping me. 
 Helping you. 
 Larissa's not a hooker. 
 She's a licensed s*x surrogate. 
 Oh, okay. 
 And what's your sexual problem? 
 Dmitri only gets aroused by a princess. 
 Well, you look like a princess. 
 Oh, thank you. 
 But not me. Dmitri. 
 Oh,  he  needs to be the princess. 
 Yeah. 
 When he dresses like a princess, it totally takes me out of the moment. 
 It, like, makes me laugh. 
 [Chuckling] It's, like... 
 I guess his hooker didn't laugh. 
 Huh. 
 Where were you between 6:00 and midnight last night? 
 Home. 
 I was making Claire chicken piccata for dinner. 
 It was a special date. 
 Your  second  date. 
 Yes, I saw Larissa yesterday, and, yes, we had s*x, but it was only to prepare for my date with Claire. 
 So I could, you know, lessen my... performance anxiety. 
 Oh, your majesty has anxiety? 
 Please don't make fun of my very particular sexual issues. 
 [Chuckles] 
 Larissa was a beautiful, warm, caring person. 
 Because of her, I was finally starting to get better. 
 But you couldn't tell your girlfriend. 
 She just wouldn't understand. 
 What's there to understand? 
 I mean, really, if, like... if, like, you're paying for s*x, that's prostitution, is it not? 
 Although... 
 What? 
 Dmitri has... he's... 
 He has been getting better, you know? 
 I'm afraid to ask. 
 Well, see, he's, um... he's weaned himself down to, like, just a tiara. 
 Oh. 
 So, it's like... Yeah. 
 Anyway, this woman must have been helping. 
 Maybe I shouldn't be so judgmental, right? 
 A princess? 
 A princess. 
 Hmm. Alibi? 
 Chicken piccata. 
 Well, they corroborate each other's story. 
 Hmm. 
 Oh, Moto, you shouldn't have. 
 I found these purple roses at the victim's apartment, so I took them to the botanical expert at the university to see if it meant something. 
 Okay. 
 "The ebb tide floribunda rose... 
 "a rare varietal that has double blooms of velvety plum petals with a scent of spicy clove." 
 Nothing you are saying means anything at all to the case. 
 Unless someone sent them to the victim. 
 And somebody did. 
 This is a designer rose hybrid that's only sold at specialty shops, and I'm getting a list of those places. 
 Excellent. 
 Thank you. 
 Yes, Moto. Excellent. 
 Gravely stole my word. 
 Thanks, lieutenant. 
 You know, he could be on to something. 
 I'll be holding my breath in my office. 
 Nadia : Larissa was a licensed sexual surrogate in the state of Oregon. 
 She was noticeably one of the most beautiful within her professional association. 
 Surrogates usually need to work with a supervising psychotherapist. 
 I met one on an adventure cruise to the Galapagos. 
 Fascinating woman. 
 Well, "princess" Dmitri Green told us that he was referred to Larissa by Dr. Morton Fleck in East Portland. 
 Dr. Fleck is not gonna tell us anything. 
 Doctor privilege? 
 He might speak to a prospective client. 
 Yeah, but where will we find someone who seems maladjusted to women, unable to commit to an intimate and loving relationship, and uncomfortable with s*x outside the type that requires financial remuneration? 
 Dr. Fleck, I have a problem. 
 I'm afraid to get undressed. 
 Before s*x? 
 Before, during. 
 Spiders and bacteria, microscopic vermin... they... they get inside. 
 So far, so good. 
 Fleck : Inside you? 
 Yeah, in my body. 
 And how do they get there? 
 Through... orifices and membranes, you know? 
 They conspire with one another. 
 And that is why I need to smear my body with peroxide before s*x. 
 I think you would benefit from the expertise of a therapist I know. 
 Her name is Sandy Hale-Cooper. 
 She's an intimacy specialist. 
 Ah, how about that? 
 I was hoping to draw Larissa Moscovitz. 
 Uh-oh. 
 He's diverging from Niedermayer's script. 
 Ms. Moscovitz is no longer taking clients. 
 Because she was murdered. 
 I'm here five minutes, and you toss me one of your girls like she's a piece of chewing gum. 
 Now, if you don't want to get charged as a pimp, you better cooperate. 
 I want a list of all the people you've referred to Larissa Moscovitz. 
 I'm an assistant district attorney hearing blackmail threats. 
 So get out of here. 
 Detective, I was shocked and saddened to hear about Larissa. 
 She was a good person. And I hope you find her killer, but doctor-patient confidentiality is the bedrock of my practice. 
 Oh, come on. 
 The nonsense you told me about membranes... 
 I'm sure you think you simply pulled it out of the ether, but that lie tells me you suffer from a specific range of issues. 
 That lie tells you nothing 'cause it was a lie. 
 You've gone through life unloved, and thus unable to love. 
 You boast of your prowess as a lover. 
 Well, that is true. 
 Boasting of sexual prowess is a statement of pure ego based on competition with other males... nothing to do with women. 
 Wait, no. 
 Sexual stimulation and other physical outlets... 
 I... okay. 
 Eating, drinking, drugs... are your coping mechanisms to disconnect from your emotions. 
 Pleasure without vulnerability, fun without feeling. 
 For you, s*x is not a form of connection. 
 Rather, it's a shield, perhaps because you were abandoned by your mother or bullied by your father... 
 Okay. 
 Or rejected by the rest of your family. 
 Wow. 
 Believe me. Your issues  are  real. 
 Ms. Hale-Cooper can help you. 
 I never heard such a load of crap in all my life. 
 Yeah, I couldn't hear anything. 
 There was static on the microphone. 
 I just wish that Fleck had offered up a list of Larissa's clients. 
 Well, he didn't. 
 Get some good advice, though? 
 None of your business, Gravely. 
 All I know is he's sitting on a mountain of evidence. 
 Go take your buddy Kines... 
 No, not my buddy. He is a jerk. 
 Go take your jerk Kines down to the courthouse. 
 Get me a warrant... now. 
 Ah, lieutenant. 
 The pathologist says that Larissa Moscovitz had consensual s*x shortly before she died. 
 How do they know it's consensual? 
 Well, actually, forced sexual intercourse results in micro tears in their... 
 Oh, okay, okay, oh, oh. 
 Anyway, there was DNA... sperm... 
 I know what DNA is. 
 Indicating that she had unprotected s*x, which suggests that it was personal, not in the line of duty. 
 She had a boyfriend. 
 We've been unable to uncover any kind of personal life at all. 
 What about her cellphone? 
 Well, she hasn't called anyone with enough regularity to indicate a romantic relationship, and there are several sporadic phone calls to men who may or may not be clients. 
 [Clears throat] 
 Have Almond check their alibis. 
 Yeah, of course. Hey, how did it go with Fleck? 
 Did you get any information? 
 Not much, but I did get the number of one of Larissa's colleagues. 
 Hookers love sharing information about dodgy Johns. 
 Not a hooker, not Johns. 
 Close enough. 
 [Sea gulls cawing] 
 What is happening? 
 I'm expecting a visitor. 
 God, my mother? 
 No, not your mother. 
 She's not a hooker anymore. 
 You know, maybe you shouldn't have hookers come to your home when you're a cop. 
 It's not exactly a hooker. 
 It's, like, a... Prosti-therapist. 
 [Electronic voice] Work. Work. Work. Work. 
 
 
 
 [Knock on door] 
 Could you get that? 
 Yeah, yeah. Ahh. 
 Work. Work.  [Cellphone beeps] 
 What? I can't talk right now. 
 We traced Moto's roses to a flower shop downtown. 
 Yeah? Who sent them? 
 Uh, no name, but a phone number. 
 Don't keep me in suspense. 
 Okay, griepal, Newman, & Keane, a high-powered law firm also downtown. 
 Well, perhaps the roses were sent to the victim by a fancy esquire? 
 Uh, dump it off on Almond. I got to go. 
 Valentine : Well, I'm gonna head out. 
 [Clears throat] 
 Have fun with your, uh, kindergarten-teacher fantasy. 
 Hi, I'm Sandy Hale-Cooper. 
 This is a new one on me. 
 And on me. 
 Oh, let me guess. 
 I'm a little different than you imagined. 
 Yeah, just a little. 
 You know, I'm not here to indulge your fantasies. 
 Yeah? Why would I pay you 200 bucks? 
 Well, am I here as a Dr. Fleck referral or a source of information on Larissa's murder? 
 [Sighs] 
 Information for Larissa's murder. 
 You knew her well? 
 A little. 
 You know of anyone who wanted to harm her? 
 Her Johns? 
 We don't call them "Johns." 
 Okay, Johns, clients, horny guys. 
 s*x therapy is different than prostitution in its intent. 
 Ah. 
 A hooker's like a retail store who hopes that you come back. 
 Surrogates, on the other hand... we enable a person to move on with their life, to function in a healthy manner. 
 We're healers. 
 Dr. Fleck mentioned that you might have some profound mother issues. 
 Do you agree? 
 Does your mother know what you do for a living? 
 Okay, you're avoiding answering my question by asking one of your own. 
 I don't want to talk about my mother. 
 Well, that is a good, honest beginning. 
 Thank you. 
 You're welcome. 
 Are you familiar with the object-relations approach to psychotherapy? 
 Doo-dongs and handcuffs? 
 No. 
 A mother's breast is the first object that an infant encounters. 
 This experience is entrenched in the subconscious as the good breast or the bad breast. 
 Okay. 
 And that is where we're gonna start. 
 [Explosion] 
 Where's Miss Kindergarten? 
 [Sighs] 
 Oh, you look traumatized. 
 Well, I think I know what the killer's motivation is now. 
 If Larissa Moscovitz's idea of a $200 visit is a lot of talking and breast-feeding, that would drive any man to murder. 
 She breast-fed you? 
 Oh, um, it was a kind of role-playing. 
 Come on. 
 Tell me you've never dressed up like some kind of naughty little sailor boy before. 
 I once had a trick ask me to call him "mommy." 
 Sandy would have said that he was in mourning for the loss of the breast. 
 Well, that can't be the case with you. 
 Didn't your mother die giving birth to you? 
 How could you miss something that you never had? 
 She also advised me to find an object that symbolizes my mother and put it in a place of honor to remember her by. 
 Like a shrine? 
 Exactly. 
 Do you have anything that symbolizes your mother? 
 Yeah. 
 This. 
 She made it for me before I was born. 
 She made a bowl for a baby? 
 She was a ceramics artist. 
 All right, I'm sorry. It's very nice. Let me see it. 
 No. It's mine. 
 [Sighs] 
 [Sighs] 
 You want me to do the talking? 
 No, this is my hunch. 
 You told me to follow it. 
 I already got an appointment set up with the big man in charge to see who bought those roses for the victim. 
 Very good. 
 Thank you, sir. 
 Detective John Almond and Officer Frank Moto here to see Mr. Keane. 
 Oh. 
 Hello again, Ms. McGrail. 
 Hi. 
 Small world. 
 Yeah, it's really small. 
 Some people say follow the money. 
 I say follow the roses. 
 Backstrom : When asked about his knowledge of the crime Dmitri green replied that it wasn't what it looked like. 
 McGrail then replied, "it looks like something?" 
 Well, it did. 
 I'm you... filled with shock and outrage that my boyfriend is paying another woman for s*x. 
 But I have a relationship with her, as well. 
 I sent her flowers. Why? 
 Am I a lesbian? 
 Did you want a lawyer? 
 Want us to call one of your bosses? 
 No! 
 No, no, no. I don't... I don't need my bosses. 
 I-I knew about Larissa and Dmitri the whole time, and I really liked her. 
 You were faking the shock and outrage. 
 Not for us. 
 For your boyfriend. Ah. 
 You were checking up on him. 
 Yes. 
 And Larissa asked me not to tell Dmitri about my snooping. 
 She said it could impede his... his progress. 
 Why change things, huh? 
 I mean, he was getting better in bed. 
 Oh, so much better. Oh, my God. 
 Yeah, bet he was, the dog. 
 How did you see Larissa without a reference from Dr. Fleck? 
 I said I was an actress researching a role about a s*x surrogate. 
 Yeah. 
 And the roses were my apology when she figured out the truth. 
 And my thank you. 
 For saving your relationship. 
 Yes. 
 And not just his princess fixation. 
 Larissa told me some hard facts about myself that have made me a better person. 
 She helped me recognize my own issues with dominance and submission. 
 Save it. 
 Not all of us are gullible and weak-minded enough to buy all that therapy crap. 
 Oh, it's not for everyone. I know. 
 Once, I was in her apartment, and this red-haired woman showed up calling Larissa a fraud and threatening to kill her. 
 I was like... 
 Oh, m-maybe I should have mentioned that sooner. 
 Red hair, red hair. 
 None of Larissa's clients could be described as a woman with red hair. 
 Maybe it was somebody in her personal life. 
 Larissa seemed to have no private life. 
 Every single one of her phone calls was to either Fleck or a client. 
 Well, the boy in the wheelchair... 
 I mean, he was a client, and he has red hair. 
 But Claire McGrail said it was a woman, and she didn't say anything about a wheelchair. 
 Well, the kid got red hair from somewhere. 
 Right. 
 I admit I found it creepy... a 22-year-old boy paying a Russian woman for s*x. 
 So you found out and confronted her? 
 Yes. 
 But Larissa asked to meet for coffee and changed my mind. 
 That must've been a good cup of coffee. 
 She pointed out that my son isn't a 22-year-old  boy. 
 He's a 22-year-old  man. 
 Nice. 
 So, what can you tell me about Larissa? 
 Hey, how old were you when you first got laid? 
 [Laughs] 
 The regular age. 
 I-I was 13 when I broke my back. 
 Do you remember trying to just, like, talk to girls? 
 I got a gift, so that was never really a problem. 
 I-I had a pretty huge problem. 
 Mostly the wheels and my shrunken legs. 
 Yeah, but your man bits still work, right? 
 Oh, yeah. Fully functioning. 
 It's like Larissa said... I'm really lucky. 
 I just waited so long that by the time I started, I... 
 I went on a bunch of mercy dates, but the mercy dates never led to mercy. 
 Yeah, I get it. 
 So, the s*x surrogate put you over the hump. 
 Yeah, not the first one. 
 But Larissa... she just gave me the confidence to inspire confidence. 
 Wow. That's deep.  
 Yeah. 
 Well, what about now she's gone? 
 We're done. 
 I don't need Larissa anymore 'cause I've got Tanya. 
 Whoa. 
 I got her the regular way. 
 Okay. All right. 
 Fist bump. 
 So, wait... Larissa was your second surrogate? 
 Yeah, the first one... she was older. 
 Her name was, uh, Sandy, and she got really mad when Dr. Fleck had me transferred to Larissa. 
 Hmm. 
 Good to see you again, Ms. hale. 
 Or do you prefer "Ms. Cooper"? 
 Uh, Hale-hyphen-Cooper. 
 Isn't this a conflict of interest? 
 Why is it a conflict of interest? 
 It's not. 
 Well, listen, a lot of times out on the street, an old hooker... 
 Okay, I'm not a prostitute. 
 You need to stop with that. 
 A thousand apologies. 
 A, uh, sexual-healer woman will get jealous of a young girl and cut her. 
 What are you suggesting? 
 Well, that red-headed kid in the wheelchair... he said you got awfully mad when he asked for a younger, hotter surrogate. 
 Yes, but my anger was aimed at Dr. Fleck, not Larissa or Joshua Larimer. 
 Surrogates are not objects of desire. 
 You wouldn't ask for a prettier therapist. 
 I wouldn't go to a therapist. 
 You came to me, and  I'm  a therapist. 
 [Clears throat] 
 Oh, my God. 
 What? 
 You mean Backstrom and a suspect? 
 No. Nobody said that. 
 All we know is that the lieutenant met with a suspect in a professional manner. 
 There's plenty of work to go around. 
 Different clients have different needs. 
 Take you. 
 I am not a client. 
 Write that down. 
 The lieutenant did not have s*x with the suspect. 
 Your p0rn habit... 
 Oh, here we go. 
 Has diminished the full range of your sexual response. 
 Now, a few more sessions with me... 
 Did she say "more sessions"? 
 And your response could be deeper, more meaningful, more erotic, more human. 
 You'd stop saying that you like hookers and say that you like women. 
 Oh. He likes hookers. 
 [Chuckles] 
 Can we talk about Larissa? 
 Frankly, Larissa would never have been a truly successful surrogate because she used her beauty. 
 But if it was Dr. Fleck referring clients and he preferred Larissa to you, oh, that would cut into your income. 
 Dr. Fleck did not prefer Larissa as a surrogate. 
 That was a statement of pure ego, based in a competition with another woman. 
 You heard that from Dr. Fleck. 
 How did you... 
 You were sleeping with Fleck. 
 [Scoffs] No, I'm not. 
 Fleck makes moves on all his surrogates. 
 The good ones rebuff him. 
 I'm a good one. 
 Larissa had unprotected s*x with someone right before she was killed. 
 Well, then, it must have been personal, not a client, 'cause we always use condoms with clients. 
 Fleck. 
 That's... that's what I'm thinking. 
 And if it ever got out that Fleck was... flecking one of his surrogates... 
 It would ruin his career. [Sighs] 
 That's not a bad motive for murder. 
 [Chuckles] 
 Kines : In light of the recent revelation that Dr. Fleck had sexual relations with the victim shortly before her death, the state asks that you reconsider a motion to compel him to release the relevant patient files. 
 By denying access to Larissa Moscovitz's client list, Dr. Fleck has prevented us from narrowing down the number of suspects. 
 Particularly suspicious now that he is one of those suspects. 
 Then why aren't you asking for his DNA? 
 We are. Will Dr. Fleck submit to a DNA test? 
 He will if you have evidence of a sexual relationship with the victim. 
 How many clients are we talking about? 
 We won't know until we see them. 
 Oh, your honor, please. This is too broad for consideration. 
 No, no, no, I see the relevance. 
 Dr. Fleck  will  submit DNA and fork over the files. 
 If there's any hint of tampering, I'll have him arrested for obstruction. 
 Of course, your honor. 
 Three erectile dysfunctions, an old man who is in love with a covered bridge, um, kid in a wheelchair, guy who can't have s*x unless he's lying on a bed of broken glass. 
 People are messed up, man. 
 "Melanie suffers from hybristophilia." 
 What's that? 
 "Bristophil..." love of criminals? 
 It says, "she enjoys s*x "only with men who have committed acts of outrage, cheating, lying, theft, and assault." 
 Mm. In France, we'd say she likes men from Marseille. 
 [Laughs]  Oui, oui. 
 Valentine : [Clears throat] 
 Hey. 
 Hey. 
 Backstrom here? 
 [Thunder rumbles] 
 Sorry to interrupt you giving yourself cancer. 
 [Sighs] 
 I need to talk to you. 
 What about? 
 Look, we're half brothers, yeah? 
 So that makes us practically brothers. 
 Glad you got that all figured out. 
 After the therapy lady came over the other day... 
 Oh, God. 
 Here we go. Really? Okay. 
 I saw... 
 I saw how affected you were by the stuff regarding your mother, and I wanted to help. 
 Listen. 
 My mother died in childbirth, okay? 
 She didn't abandon me. 
 It wasn't her fault. 
 If anything, it was  my  fault. 
 I mean, I'm not saying that it's my fault. 
 I was just an infant. 
 You babble... you babble when you're rattled, so just stop it. 
 I came here to tell you that your mother didn't die in childbirth. 
 How? 
 What are you talking about? 
 My mom's mom worked at the hospital at the time, and she has a very different story. 
 Wait a minute. 
 You talked to your mom about this? 
 Yes. 
 When? 
 Today. 
 She talked to  her  mom. 
 So you're single-handedly connecting families all over Oregon. 
 [Sighs] 
 Marie Backstrom killed herself a few months after you were born, and she used your father's service revolver. 
 I'm sorry. 
 I just thought you should know. 
 Your surrogate was right. 
 You  were  abandoned. 
 Are you mad at me for meddling? 
 No. 
 It's... we're family. 
 That's what family does. They meddle. 
 I said it's fine. 
 You should make that shrine. 
 [Siren wails in distance] 
 Fleck isn't our guy. 
 DNA? 
 Doesn't matter. 
 He has an air-tight alibi. 
 At the time of Larissa's death, he was watching a movie, and the security cameras at the cineplex... they confirm it. 
 Okay. 
 But our man Moto found something interesting in Joshua Larimer's file. 
 Larissa informed Fleck that she was worried about Joshua's increasing dependence upon her, but Joshua told Moto that he found a new girl and was happy that his time with Larissa was over. 
 Mm. 
 So, Larissa was saying the wheelchair kid was in love with her. 
 s*x surrogates allot a certain number of visits. 
 It's usually around 12 is the limit. 
 That gives both parties a definitive end date. 
 They were three past their limit. 
 She  was in love with  him. 
 You think so? 
 Think about it. 
 I'm a friendless s*x surrogate giving love and receiving none in return. 
 I have no life. 
 Then I meet this happy kid. 
 Sure, he's got bum legs, but he's not ugly. 
 And I've completely cured him. 
 All of a sudden, I'm the one who needs therapy. 
 Joshua Larimer kills Larissa to get free from his therapist? 
 What's the number-one cause of homicide, Niedermayer? 
 Hate? 
 Love. 
 Love. 
 It's love. 
 Worst thing that can happen to a guy. 
 Well, he certainly has the upper-body strength to swing a shovel, except... 
 Yeah. 
 How would he stash the murder weapon? 
 Exactly. 
 [Sighs] 
 What? 
 Who takes care of a kid when they're in trouble? 
 His mother. 
 His mother. 
 Mothers. Mothers are confusing. 
 You would never abandon your son. 
 No, I'd die first. 
 I'm you, a mom. 
 I'd do whatever it takes. 
 [Clears throat] 
 So, your son's clinical case file says that he was begging Larissa to see him again. 
 Well, she did see him, but he wasn't begging. 
 He was confident. 
 She says he was depressed and despondent. 
 Well, that's not true. 
 She wrote that case file, not him. 
 They had 12 sessions, and she helped him. 
 She really did. 
 He was grateful, but [Sighs] 
 She got too attached. 
 He outgrew her. 
 She was the one asking for more sessions. 
 Why do you care who was asking for more? 
 Because it's the truth. 
 She wouldn't let him go. 
 She was threatening his chance at a normal, happy life. 
 I'm Joshua. 
 I'm over it. 
 I've moved on. 
 I'm confident now, but I'm still horny. 
 Like any boy for any girl, only worse 'cause I've waited such a long time. 
 I'll take whatever I can get. 
 So I see Larissa again. 
 But what do I tell my non-hooker girlfriend? 
 Am I bad person? 
 It wasn't his fault. 
 I'm you. 
 I follow Larissa to the Wildwood rose garden. 
 I've never been to the Wildwood rose garden. 
 I tell her, "move on. 
 "Let my son be happy. 
 "He's suffered enough already. 
 Set him free." 
 I'm Larissa. 
 I'm a lonely woman... 
 And I decide to tell the truth. 
 Ah. 
 I'm in love with your son. 
 I see Larissa for what she is... a prostitute who's no longer helpful, an obstruction to my son's happiness. 
 So I whack her in the head with a shovel. 
 Ms. Larimer. 
 [Clears throat, sighs] 
 You did what you did to set your son free. 
 [Chuckles] 
 But you can't kill people. 
 [Inhales deeply] 
 Do you have any proof of this theory, detective? 
 Because if you don't, I would like to get home and make Josh his dinner. 
 [Sighs] 
 Where are the pocket-pervert pics? 
 [Sighs] 
 Paquet, why can't you make this in a way that people can read? 
 I make this in a way that everything is here. 
 Okay, like reality, it's a little bit confusing, but you cannot have it both ways. 
 What are we looking for here? 
 Janet Larimer. 
 Wait, Nadia, not all of these pictures have been printed. 
 Wait, I'll pull them up. 
 [Computer beeps] 
 Next. Go. Keep going. 
 Boobies. More. Go. Go. Wait. Go back. 
 There. 
 How do you know? 
 She's wearing that. 
 Mm. 
 Close to the time Larissa got bludgeoned. 
 Gravely : Placed at the scene. 
 So we got her, right? 
 Yeah. We do. 
 Hey, lieutenant, don't you want to make the arrest? 
 Have Moto do it. 
 Mm. 
 And that is Backstrom's way of telling you you did a good job, Moto. 
 Hey, yeah, we got her. 
 [Door closes] 
 [Footsteps approaching] 
 [Sighs] 
 So, you gonna make your shrine? 
 Yeah. Right now. 
 Hey! 
 What are you doing? Don't do that. 
 Hey, stop it. Leave my shrine alone. 
 You want me to have closure, don't you? 
 Leave it to you to blur the lines between a memorial shrine and a funeral pyre. 
 What's done is done. 
 Woman : Hello? 
 It's open. 
 Oh, God. 
 Is Miss Kindergarten back? 
 Wrong again. 
 You are a cop. 
 You cannot have hookers at the house! 
 This is not a house. 
 And how dare you call sexy Sventlana a hooker? 
 She's a s*x therapist. 
 Now go to your room. Stay there. 
 I wasn't planning to watch. 
 Well, you would if I let you. 
 Perv. 
 Hey, there. 
 Svetlana : Hi. 
 Sventlana. I'm Everett. 
 Mm. 
 [Laughs] 
 Are you really Russian? 
 [Door closes] 
 I can be whatever you want me to be. 
 [Laughs] 
 Dobriy vecher,  baby. 
 Ooh. 
 You like that? 
 Mm.
