 Are you ready? 
 What? 
 We're due at half seven. 
 Who with? 
 You used to be in to surprises. 
 When do we tell Anna? 
 Or Simon, for that matter. 
 If you're asking me to lie, I want something to make up for it. 
 Do I like these people? 
 You love them. 
 I think he's off having s*x with Kate Parks. 
 Then this new investor arrives, um, White Stone, starts ploughing in cash. 
 It's the Parks. 
 Gemma, I can't. 
 Why not? 
 Oh, hi. 
 Oh, God! You're not expecting us. 
 We've got the kids in tonight. It'll be fun! 
 I'm really not... 
 Come on! 
 God, it's gorgeous! 
 Yes, finished this six months ago. I'll give you the grand tour. 
 Oh! 
 Susie finds it embarrassing but I can't help it. I'm so proud! 
 Do tell him to shut up if you need to. 
 You'll find this REALLY interesting. 
 I'm just going to nip in the kitchen. 
 Give me a shout if you lose the will to live. 
 We can easily come back in a week or... 
 No, no! No, no, no. 
 No, it's fine! 
 Come on, let's go upstairs, you get a better view. Come on. 
 Yes! 
 So, we used a new type of glass on the back of the house. 
 I don't understand the technology but essentially, it's double height, thin and stays hot. 
 Like Naomi Campbell. 
 (He laughs) 
 A little joke. 
 It's beautiful. 
 Hope you don't mind me showing off? 
 If you look at the end there, you can see the pool. We loved the pool in our house in France so much that we copied the dimensions. 
 You have a place in France? 
 Yeah. Well, you can go and stay there if you like. 
 Really? 
 Yeah, we have a wonderful maid called Angelique who sorts everything out. 
 What's it called? 
 The house? 
 Does it have a name? 
 Pierre Blanche. 
 What does it mean? 
 Um... 
 Wait! You haven't got any drinks! I'm chatting away like an idiot. 
 Would you like some wine? 
 White, if you have it? 
 Of course. Beer, I assume? Beer? 
 Yeah, cheers. 
 Ah, Kate! You know the Fosters? Gemma and Simon. 
 Hi. 
 Yeah, they're staying for dinner. 
 I thought next week? 
 There's been a bit of a mix-up, so it's happening now, which is nice. 
 Just going to get some drinks. Do you want one? 
 I'll come with you. 
 OK. 
 How could you get it wrong? 
 She said next Thursday. 
 That means the Thursday of the following week! 
 Oh, OK. 
 It's just he's more of a colleague than a friend. 
 An important advisor for me, a contact. 
 I only see him a couple of times a year so if you're going to organise something like this, then it'd be nice to have a bit more notice and... 
 (Crash) 
 What... you... 
 Oh... 
 Yeah... Yes... 
 Wine for the... Oh! 
 Sorry, I knocked it with my... hand. 
 Not to worry. We'll just, er... This is for you. 
 Yeah, and er... Kate! 
 So sorry. 
 It's not a problem. 
 Was it expensive? 
 It doesn't matter. 
 Come on, let's step outside. 
 We can pay for it. Simon? 
 Could you get the dustpan and brush, please? 
 That was Mum's. 
 Mm, yeah. It was an accident. 
 Would you help me deal with this, please? It's not a problem. 
 All right! 
 Cheers! 
 So, you two have known each other a while? 
 Yeah, we meet occasionally. I give him a few pearls of wisdom. 
 But you've never been tempted to go into business together? 
 Er, no. 
 I wish. 
 Ah, he's on his way up, so he's working all the hours, I expect. 
 That's in the past for me now. I'm living off the fat. 
 I mean, obviously, a lot of my time is spent at the council and, you know, we open the odd new restaurant... 
 How did it happen? 
 You're interrupting me, darling. 
 How did it break? 
 I knocked it. 
 Mum's upset. 
 Yeah, well, could happen to anyone. 
 Music : Fly by Ludovico Einaudi I assume we can start? 
 Please. 
 Ah, at last! 
 You remember Gemma and Simon from the party? 
 Hi. 
 Shall we have music? 
 Please, God, no! 
 (Chris laughs) 
 We'll talk. Gemma, help yourself. 
 That was quite a game yesterday. On form. 
 Good result, your boy did good. 
 Yeah. 
 How's the restaurant? 
 Um... good. 
 You're a waitress, so that must be... 
 It's for the money, mostly. 
 Dad wants me to take over as manager, but... 
 I'm more interested in going into events. 
 I'm doing an internship at a local company at the moment. 
 Events. So that's...? 
 Weddings. 
 Right. 
 Divorce parties. 
 OK. 
 Funerals. 
 Is that really something people do? 
 What, die? 
 Divorce parties? 
 Yeah! 
 There you see all the ex-wives having a great time and you realise some people are just so much better off out of marriage. 
 There's no point staying in something if it's bad, if you're trapped. 
 Right. 
 How's your love life? 
 That's a personal question. 
 You talked before about a man you were seeing? 
 Sorry, isn't there a confidentiality thing between doctors and patients? 
 Yes. 
 Can we activate that thing, then, please? 
 Oh, your mum and dad don't know? 
 Don't know what? 
 Oops. 
 Nothing, Mum. 
 Don't tell me you've got secrets? 
 Course I have! You said you prefer it that way. 
 Well, while you're under my roof, I don't want any big surprises. 
 I'm still your mum! 
 You live here? 
 We can't get rid of her! 
 I lived on my own and I didn't like it. 
 Why? What changed? 
 Wine? 
 No, thanks. 
 Susie? 
 Mm. Yes, please. 
 Gemma, actually, I wanted to say, I had an appointment but then a letter came through saying that you weren't available and I had a new doctor and then Chris heard something... 
 Yeah, a chap at the council knows your administrator. 
 There's been a formal complaint made against me, a number of negative comments online, so... 
 Online. There's always trouble when you hear that word. 
 The GMC felt it wasn't appropriate for me to stay working, so they've asked me to take some time off pending an investigation. 
 But you're the senior doctor. 
 Well, what's the complaint? 
 Chris, you can't ask that! 
 A man says I threatened to burn him with a lit cigarette unless he left his girlfriend alone. 
 He said you threatened him? 
 Well, you've just got to pity some people, haven't you? 
 Fantasist. 
 But why would he make that up? 
 He didn't. 
 He was beating up his girlfriend. I thought she needed help. 
 Oh! So you... 
 Yeah. 
 I've been under a lot of stress recently... 
 Right. 
 .. in my personal life. It's clearly affected my work. 
 It's not an excuse. 
 No, it's a reason. 
 Come on, Kate! I mean, if the girl was going to be beaten up... 
 If the girl was being beaten up, you call the police! 
 Things have been tough lately, have they? 
 Yes. Yes, I'd say so. 
 Are you listening? Stress. 
 Andrew said he wants to be a doctor. 
 No, I don't. 
 The stress is more at home, actually. 
 You must work all hours, Chris, to stay on top of everything. 
 I know you said you take it easy... 
 Simon? 
 .. but there must be times... 
 You don't mind me saying about the problems we've had? 
 I... What? 
 You don't mind me opening up about the difficulties we've experienced? 
 Difficulties? 
 All right, not difficulties. 
 That's a euphemism, I suppose, as we're in company. 
 But, OK, good. Let's be precise. Not difficulties. 
 Betrayals. 
 OK? 
 I know we haven't talked about it with each other, but... we both know what's been going on, don't we? 
 Gemma, are you... 
 Do you want me to spell it out? 
 If there's really something we need talk through, then I don't think this is... 
 For the last two years, Simon's been secretly having s*x with another woman. 
 Well, more of a girl, really. 
 I know we haven't spoken about it, but these are our friends and I want to be honest. 
 You haven't talked about this until now? 
 I think this is a joke! 
 That's a lie. 
 Sometimes she says these things to get a reaction but I've no idea what she's talking about. 
 He's lying now. See? 
 Maybe we should call it a night. 
 Is that OK? 
 Mm-hm. 
 Pierre Blanche. 
 What? 
 Pierre Blanche means White Stone. 
 Simon, isn't that the name of your main investor? 
 I thought that you said that you two didn't do business together? 
 It's confidential. 
 Simon has this big project called Academy Green. 
 He couldn't raise any money so it ended up being entirely bank-rolled by this single mystery company with an enigmatic title. 
 White Stone. And now it makes sense. 
 What do you mean bank-rolled? 
 Dad has put in nearly all the money. 
 Oh, wait. You don't know? 
 That's interesting. 
 (Chris clears throat) 
 You two are obviously in the middle of something... 
 Simon said ages ago that he had a friend on the local council who helped him secure the site, pulled some strings. So that must have been you? 
 I didn't... 
 Chris, yes, you boasted about it. 
 It's illegal if you're investing in the project yourself. 
 It's a conflict of interest. 
 You're in business with Dad? 
 Why didn't you tell me? 
 Gemma... 
 Is there something I don't know? 
 Tell them. 
 Chris, Susie... 
 Actually no, you've had two years. I'll do it. 
 Susie, you'll notice that Kate looks quite unhappy. 
 Simon : It's OK. 
 You're a f*cking bitch! 
 Bitch is right. 
 I'm a wolf tonight! 
 You mean you've been... 
 Sorry, Susie, but your daughter's not a little girl any more. 
 You can ask my husband. 
 He likes blow jobs, apparently, and I'm told she really knows what she's doing. 
 Get out! Get out now! 
 No, there's more. 
 No, no! 
 Don't. 
 Do you want to do it or... 
 Go on, then! You'll break all your rules of confidentiality and tell my parents the most personal thing in my life! 
 Kate got pregnant with Simon's child and because he messed her around so much, she had it aborted. 
 OK. 
 OK. 
 You ancient f*cking c**t! 
 No... 
 Get her out! 
 (Sobbing) 
 What the f*ck was that? 
 I wasn't ill at your party. 
 What? 
 I found your other phone in the boot of your car. 
 Oh, Jesus! OK. 
 So, you've known since... 
 Are you coming back with me? 
 (Front door shuts) 
 We need to talk. 
 Of course not. I've got to sort this out. 
 It's just that's where our son lives. 
 Simon, they have literally closed the door on you. They hate you. 
 I'm assuming that you didn't tell them in case Chris withdrew the funding. 
 Yeah, and if I had, we'd be bankrupt. You want the truth? 
 Everything we have... 
 Is invested in Academy Green. Yeah, I know. Neil said. 
 He wouldn't. 
 Just after we slept together. 
 He was all right, actually. 
 I wouldn't sell tickets but we had a good time. 
 You wanted to get back at me. 
 Is it sinking in? 
 Have you felt it yet? 
 No. 
 But you will. 
 How was Kate? 
 I mean, the things she must be able to do with that tongue. 
 How was Neil? 
 I came, hard, once. 
 He's slightly bigger than you but not as good. 
 Gemma, I made a mistake but it wasn't about s*x. I didn't want this to happen. 
 I know you won't believe me, but when I met Kate, we just sparked. 
 I had to find out what it was. 
 So, helpless? 
 And yes, I didn't want Chris to find out because of the money but that wasn't the main reason I didn't tell you. 
 Selfish? Nasty? 
 It's because I still love you. Despite all this, I do. 
 Just shut up and listen. 
 We will NEVER have a relationship again. 
 Now, here's what I want. 
 Leave me and Tom living in our house and go away somewhere else, start again. 
 No. No, I'm not moving. 
 (Front door opens) 
 We can't stay here. 
 (Car door opens) 
 We can go to the house. 
 Most of my stuff's still there. 
 Please, Kate. Please, stop. 
 Tom will want to know what's happening. 
 You know, I used to feel sorry for you! 
 I've always said he should tell you the truth. Now I get why he didn't. 
 Why is it women go mad when they get old? 
 You're still pregnant. 
 You didn't drink wine at the table. 
 You didn't have the abortion. 
 She was testing you to see if you wanted her or just the baby. 
 And you passed, went back. 
 Well done. 
 Really? 
 Yeah. 
 (Car engine starts) 
 Please don't tell Tom. 
 Not yet. 
 (Rings doorbell) 
 Hello! 
 Everything all right? 
 Are you going to invite me in? 
 I recognise that voice! 
 Hey, hello! 
 Are you coming in? 
 Thanks. 
 Can I get you anything? 
 No. 
 So, to what do we owe this pleasure? 
 How did you know about it? 
 I'm sorry? 
 What we did? 
 Did you check his text messages? 
 He can't have been stupid enough to have left them on his phone. 
 He strays... which I accept. 
 As long as I have knowledge of where... 
 You are... and who. 
 Sometimes I follow him to check who's he's meeting. 
 Normally, it's women I've never met. 
 Don't care about. 
 Until you. 
 Never one of our friends before... 
 Anna, I'm s... 
 Not in front of her. 
 (She breathes raggedly) 
 How did you find out about Simon? Did he tell you? 
 No. We ran into him with Kate, in London. 
 It was awkward at first, but actually, we got on, ended up having a drink. And we were very clear, from the beginning. 
 His marriage is not our business. We stay out. 
 Was it that hair of hers you found? 
 Yeah. I thought that might start things off. 
 So, you knew when we were...? 
 Yeah. 
 That's why she felt able to. 
 You're really clever, aren't you? 
 I'm not a doctor, but I do all right. 
 Why didn't we ever get on? 
 You're joking? 
 You know, Neil and I might not be perfect, but we know what the other one needs. We function. 
 We don't talk about what he does. 
 Until now, thanks to you. 
 But you and Simon, you don't know each other at all. Never have. 
 And why the comments? 
 What comments? 
 The night that we met up... someone started to put negative comments about me online. 
 It took me till just now, standing out there... to work out who it was. 
 Who would have the time? The reason to do it? 
 God, you have no idea how you come across. 
 What people say about you when you leave the room. 
 They breathe a sigh of relief. 
 Because I don't know if you mean to, but you make them feel inadequate, and even though you say you like them, it's clear you think you're very slightly better. 
 Better than all of us. 
 Those stories I put online, they may be made up... but what they're saying is all true. 
 Delete them. 
 Sure. 
 But that's not WHY she came round. 
 Is it? So, I'd remove the messages. 
 You came here tonight to reveal your secret. 
 Break us up, maybe. 
 But, look. 
 We're still together. 
 Aren't we? 
 Yeah. 
 Thanks. 
 Hey. How was it? 
 (Laughter from tv) 
 Has anyone called? 
 Here? Tonight? No. 
 OK. Well... 
 He's not here, that's how it went. 
 Where did you go? 
 For dinner. 
 So, is he staying with her? 
 How's Tom been? 
 Er, we watched TV and then he went to bed. 
 He's asleep now, I think. 
 Isobel? Come on, love. 
 It's time to go home, grab my stuff, will you? 
 I'll... just... leave you to it. 
 Come on. 
 I'm sorry. 
 You like secrets, don't you? 
 I'm not the only one. 
 I want to keep it. 
 OK. 
 Do you? 
 Yeah. 
 I could talk to Dad this morning. 
 Explain. Get him to keep the funding going, right? 
 That's what we need. 
 If you think you can. 
 (Knock at door) 
 (He sighs) 
 Who are you? 
 I'm, um... 
 Er, you're... 
 Is my dad here? 
 Um, he... Yeah. 
 Yeah, come in. 
 Simon! 
 It's your son. 
 (Footsteps approach) 
 Hey, mate, what are you...? 
 Mum said that she had some stuff to do, but that you'd be here, and you'd take me to school. 
 What's going on? 
 Yeah, OK... I can take you. 
 Who's she? 
 This is my friend, Kate. 
 Your "friend"? 
 Mum and me had a row, Kate let me stay in the spare room. 
 How old are you? 
 23. 
 Are you having s*x with each other? 
 What?! 
 Tom...! 
 Don't lie to me. 
 Mate, listen. 
 Kate's just a friend. 
 Promise. Yeah? 
 Now, you stay here, I'll get my stuff, take you in, OK? Two minutes. 
 We'll have to take your car. 
 You're Andrew Parks's sister. 
 Yeah. 
 At the football, some of them fancied you. 
 OK. 
 But then your brother said they shouldn't because you're a slut and have s*x with loads of people all the time. 
 Andrew doesn't like me very much. He makes things up. 
 Is it... true, though? 
 It... 
 Women can have as much s*x as they like, Tom. 
 Just like men. 
 Not with Dad though! 
 He just told you. 
 We're good... friends. 
 OK? 
 I can drop you by the gate. 
 No, thanks. 
 Adam! 
 We need to sort this out. 
 (She sighs) 
 (Clattering) 
 (He sobs) 
 
 
 
 (Door bell chimes) 
 You don't have to ring the bell. 
 (She sniffles) 
 Where's Mum? 
 Migraine. 
 So, what did he do first? Get my money or sleep with my daughter? 
 We met at that networking event... when I was doing the drinks. 
 We talked, we got on. 
 He was using you to get to me. 
 Dad... 
 He didn't tell you we were working together. 
 He was protecting me. 
 Right. Well, whatever he said to you, he's very bad at business. 
 At first, I thought he was onto something, but then the further we got, I started smelling... bullshit. 
 He's been unlucky. 
 Sweetheart, that is naive, He's been incredibly lucky, but he's messed it up every step of the way. 
 Well, you have to keep going. 
 With him? Giving him money? I don't think so. 
 Dad, the only reason he took so long to tell you... 
 He didn't tell me. His wife did! 
 Let me finish! 
 He didn't want to leave her and Tom with nothing. - (Oh, God...) 
 (He sighs) 
 You think I haven't looked at another women since I married? 
 I have. 
 Course I have. 
 Yeah, I work hard to fulfil the promise for your mum. 
 Yeah, well, you're amazing, as always(!) 
 Fine, don't help him, then. 
 Do it for me. 
 You made a mistake. 
 You're an adult and there are consequences. 
 (She sobs) 
 (She sniffles) 
 You're not even going to hug me. 
 Course I am. Come here. 
 Come here. 
 Mm. 
 (She weeps) 
 Dad? 
 Mmm... 
 (She sniffles) 
 I'm still pregnant. 
 You can't just walk away from him. 
 All right. 
 All right. We'll look after you and the child. 
 You have a room here if you need it. 
 You can always come back if you need to. Always. 
 But he's getting no more money from me. 
 Ever. 
 (Door slams) 
 That do it for you? 
 How do I know you won't say anything? 
 We actually want the same thing. 
 What are you going to do now? 
 (Door slams) 
 (Chatter and hubbub) 
 Hey! 
 You're here to see Ros? 
 Yeah. 
 Gemma, you should know, before you got here... 
 Hi. 
 Want to come with me? 
 There is still the outstanding complaint. 
 All doctors get complaints. 
 And as I said on the phone, there is no reason I can't come back. 
 I thought we'd go somewhere more private. 
 Um, Simon called me just after you did. 
 He told me what happened last night, and I thought perhaps the best thing would be for you to speak somewhere more neutral, to work this out. 
 So no-one else is caught up in the middle. 
 I'll be around if you need me. 
 Thanks. 
 (Door closes) 
 (Drops keys, clears throat) 
 Kate says her dad won't help. 
 He's going to cut me out. 
 I assume you'd... spoken already? 
 If he didn't do what you wanted you'd go to the council... tell them about the conflict of interest. 
 Yeah. 
 He's going to give the project to a new developer. 
 And then, when it's finished and sold, he'll pay me back every penny. 
 In the meantime, he'll cover my expenses. 
 I'll keep the house. 
 Get the savings back. 
 It's my project. I did all the work. 
 You're not as good-looking as you think. 
 What was that, this morning? Leaving Tom on the doorstep. 
 Did you tell him? 
 It's not fair, putting him in that position. 
 He has a right to hear the truth. 
 I THOUGHT that you would want to do that yourself, but, fine, you've had your chance. 
 Please, can we just try to... 
 Either you leave, or I tell the police that you forged my signature on the mortgage. 
 (Chair scrapes) 
 What are you doing? 
 I bought all your clothes. 
 In fact, anything from the last two years came out of money that I earned. You can't argue with that. This. 
 Your car's mine. And this. 
 I'm not leaving. Kate doesn't want to. 
 And I can't live far from Tom so we're just going to have to start to talk. 
 You have to leave. 
 I'm not going anywhere. 
 Simon... 
 (Shattering) 
 Gemma... 
 What? You've got another one. 
 (Banging) 
 (Door opens) 
 Gemma, can we speak to you? 
 No. 
 Simon explained what happened this morning with Tom, and I can see that you're... I called Martha, asked her to come and see you. 
 Hi, Gemma. 
 Why? 
 I really think the best thing for us all would be to... 
 I just want a word. 
 Before you do something you regret. 
 We think it'd be really good for you to see somebody that's not us, that you trust... 
 I don't know what happened with Tom this morning but when he, he was there on the doorstep, he looked terrified. 
 You... 
 Tom? 
 Why are you talking about Tom? 
 Is that why you won't...? 
 Are you going stop me from leaving? 
 Of course not, Gemma. 
 Move! 
 Gemma! 
 Gemma! 
 Doctor Foster! 
 Poppy, the doctor's busy! 
 They took it off, look! 
 That's good, but you have to be careful. 
 It's better, but it's not quite... 
 ♪ Doctor Foster went to Gloucester... ♪ - No! 
 No, Poppy, it's not Doctor Foster any more. I'm getting divorced. 
 And changing my name is what you'd call a "silver lining". 
 Gemma... 
 Bye. 
 Stop. 
 And think. 
 Work this out, before it all gets worse. 
 Do you want your car keys? 
 What? 
 Fetch. 
 (She grunts) 
 I've just had a call from your husband. 
 He requested that I didn't release Tom. 
 My husband and I aren't together any more. 
 So, unless you honestly think there's a safeguarding issue, or that I'm drunk, or mentally unwell, or an urgent danger to my son, then you have to let me take him. 
 Right now. 
 (Car revs) 
 (Engine revs) 
 Is she here? 
 You say I have to go and knock on a door, cos that's where Dad is, and as soon as it's opened you drive off. 
 Inside there's that girl. 
 Everyone's saying she's a slut. 
 Don't use words like that. 
 She is though, I'm not stupid! 
 I can guess what's happening... but you don't tell me anything. 
 If you don't, I'm going to open the door! 
 OK. 
 (Tyres screech) 
 (Engine revs) 
 (Rumbling) 
 Where are we going? 
 What are you doing? 
 You wanted to stop. 
 So, what do you think's going on? 
 Other families, they spend time together. 
 You get in so late, I want to talk to you, but then, you just say you're so tired. 
 Other mums, they do things for their children, packed lunches, take them places... 
 I do all those things... buy them new clothes at the weekend. And they love the dads. 
 You just work. 
 You work all the time. 
 So, I think dad got sick of it and went to have s*x with that other girl. 
 And now, you both hate each other and want to get a divorce. 
 You think it's my fault? 
 Dad has fun with me. 
 We do stuff. He's THERE! 
 He has time. He doesn't earn the money. 
 It's not all about money, Mum! 
 You like Dad? 
 Yeah. 
 You don't like me? 
 No. 
 Not at the moment. 
 (Wind howls) 
 See, you're not even talking to me now. 
 You're just ignoring me! 
 You know, you're supposed to spend time with your family? 
 Not just think about yourself... or work... 
 To do what you want to... 
 What are you doing? 
 Mum! 
 .. I tried everyone. She didn't say anything to anyone at school about where she was going so I haven't got a clue where... 
 CAR APPROACHES - Yeah... Yeah, she's got him, but I don't... 
 OK. 
 She's here. 
 Where's Tom? 
 Where is he? 
 Becky's. 
 Becky's at work. 
 Not any more. 
 So, if I call her... 
 Do you remember when we went to Devon? 
 When Tom was about three, and we went to that causeway to get to the island, and on the way back, the tide had started to come in, but you said, "Let's do it anyway," and you lifted him up onto your shoulders, and held my hand and paddled through the water. 
 That was fun. 
 You destroyed it all. 
 I wasted 14 years of my life when I could've been with someone better. 
 Who do I go to for justice? 
 To make this fair. 
 I honestly thought if I could just get us in a position where we had money, and Tom was a bit older... 
 You are so stupid. 
 OK, well... 
 Maybe my mistake was... even trying, maybe I should've come to you straightaway, said, "I know we're married, but I'm f*cking someone else." 
 Why did you do it? I still don't understand. 
 (Ringing tone) 
 Because we're all animals, sometimes we can't control our biology. 
 We fall in love when we shouldn't, we have s*x with the wrong people. 
 I'm sick of saying sorry cos it happens to people all over the world, all the time, people just deal with it, this kind of thing happens a lot. 
 You haven't. 
 What? 
 You've never said sorry. 
 'Hi.' 
 Becky, it's me. Is Tom there? 
 Gemma said he's with you. 
 OK. 
 (Keypad tone) 
 Where is he? 
 Neil said that all men cheat. 
 It's just that most of them get away with it. Is that true? 
 Where's Tom? 
 You've taken everything away from me -- my respect, my job, money. 
 So, could it be after all that, when... you made everyone think that I was mad so that I'll be removed from my son. 
 What's that? 
 His hair. 
 It... came off in my hand. 
 Could it be that I decided that I'd rather do something to protect him... from having to grow up to be someone like you? 
 What do you mean? 
 Because if it's true that all men are entirely led by the desire to f*ck anything they want, then why would I want him to grow up to be like that? 
 (She sobs) 
 Everyone will ask, "Who made her do it? 
 "How was this allowed to happen?" 
 And where were the neighbours and the friends? 
 It'll be the only thing that this town is known for. 
 Maybe I am mad... 
 You really think that I could do that? 
 I... I don't know. 
 Exactly. 
 Simon, he's so beautiful, and you don't deserve him. 
 (She sobs) 
 (sh1t...) 
 Should... 
 Through all of this, you've had that look like you're about to smile... even when things were serious, I don't think you ever got what you did. 
 The horror of losing it all. 
 And when you slept with her, you killed the person that I loved... and the son that I was going to bring up. 
 And the me that I was starting to like! 
 Everything that I wanted and worked for, loved... died. 
 (He gasps) 
 (He gasps) 
 Oh, God! 
 Oh... 
 (He sobs) 
 Mate, please...! 
 Mate? 
 Mum said that she had to spend time with you. 
 I had to wait with her friend Carly. 
 OK, well, your mum and me, we have to have a conversation about a lot of things, so maybe the best thing... 
 Mum says that you had s*x with Kate Parks for two years and hid it from her and me. 
 VOICE BREAKING: That you spent all of our money! 
 (He pants) 
 Is that true? 
 (He weeps) 
 (He sighs) 
 Yeah. I... yeah. 
 (He sobs) 
 Yeah. 
 I'm sorry. 
 I'm sorry. 
 I'm so sorry. 
 Why? 
 (He sobs) 
 I didn't want to tell him like that. 
 Then you should've been better. 
 I thought he was dead! 
 [HE SOBS] You made me think... 
 It's my hair. 
 It smells of him. 
 I smell of him. 
 (She grunts) 
 (Thuds) 
 Agh! This is it. 
 This is what it felt like. 
 Now you understand. 
 He's my son! 
 He's... my... son! 
 (Both pant) 
 (He grunts) 
 (She groans) 
 (She moans) 
 (sh1t.) 
 What are you...? 
 You know them? 
 What's happened? 
 What do you mean? 
 He just called me! 
 I hit her... 
 Have you called an ambulance? 
 No. 
 Is she all right? 
 Just stand outside. Both of you. 
 Where's Tom? 
 Upstairs. I told him to stay there. 
 I'll stop him coming in. 
 And call an ambulance. 
 And the police. 
 What? 
 Call the police, as well. 
 All right, it's all right. 
 Can you sit up? Come on, you're going to be all right. Come on. 
 .. No, no, no, listen to me, listen to me. 
 You need to stay upstairs for a second. 
 What's happened? 
 Mum's had a little accident, Tom... Tom! 
 Tom : Get off! 
 (Door slams) 
 Gemma : Where's Tom? 
 What happened? 
 Tom, it's all right, love. 
 It's all right, it's all right, she's going to be fine. 
 (Voices fade under music) 
 (She mouths) 
 (Alarm beeps) 
 Ready to go? 
 Yeah. 
 (She mouths) 
 He's withdrawn the complaint. 
 No reason not to come back. 
 And I don't like being in charge. 
 Can't do the spreadsheets! 
 You should have this. 
 Don't want any confusion. 
 Keep it. Just for a while. See how you feel. 
 Gemma... 
 Sorry. 
 I just didn't want to hurt anyone. 
 How are you? 
 Good. 
 We're moving to London. 
 Simon wanted you to know, but obviously... he's not allowed to call, so... 
 My parents are pleased, as well, actually. 
 New start. 
 Bye. 
 Do you want to sit here? 
 (Car approaches) 
 Kate : Hi...>
