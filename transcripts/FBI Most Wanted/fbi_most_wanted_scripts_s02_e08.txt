 The clouds are so cold that tiny ice crystals form. 
 But how come it rains? 
 Well, when the air is warmer like in the spring, it is rain instead of snow. 
 So HailStorm can't fight in the spring? 
 Is he the one made of ice? 
 No, that's Glacier. 
 HailStorm shoots icicles.

 Yes.

 Stabbed to death in their home in rural Maine. 
 EMS responded to a Life Alert call. 
 Notified local PD. 
 Caroline has an eight-year-old son, Caleb.

 - Kenny, what's happening? 
 - Hey, Boss. 
 So I pulled Augusta PD's records. 
 Turns out Samuel was in there twice. 
 Well, why did we only get one hit this morning? 
 Well, that's because this one,     Samuel wasn't a suspect, he was a victim. 
 He was hit by a car when he was seven years old. 
 Driver was a Jonathan Van Courtland. 
 Samuel's dad filed a police report but he never followed up. 
 Maybe they settled privately or with insurance. 
 Another thing. 
 Augusta PD's system logs every time a file is accessed. 
 Samuel's juvie file was pulled   years ago by a cop in Waterville.

 [DRAMATIC MUSICAL CRESCENDO] 
 Samuel took another kid, huh? 
 What do you mean, another? 
 I'm pretty sure he did the same thing years ago. 
 Daniel Cain. 
 Nine years old. 
 Samuel was his tutor. 
 Story was that Daniel got lost in the woods and died of exposure, but mother always thought that Samuel took him. 
 And why is that? 
 Something about him rubbed her the wrong way. 
 You know, so she fired him. 
 And a week later, a Tuesday in September, Daniel walks into the woods and doesn't walk out. 
 - Did you question Samuel? 
 - Oh, yeah. 
 I don't have any evidence. 
 But you were interested enough to pull his juvie file. 
 I talked to him, you know? 
 Something about that guy made the hair on the back of my neck stand up. 
 - Evil? 
 - Yeah. 
 So I start thinking he's had to have done this to other kids. 
 You just don't do something like that at and then stop. 
 I didn't have any proof, though. 
 Can you tell us about the search for Daniel? 
 The whole town came out. 
 You know, there was a bad storm out that night. 
 And the parents, though, they didn't want to quit, you know? 
 Traipsing outside, screaming for their kid. 
 Three days later, a cadaver dog alerts about ten miles from the Cain place. 
 We didn't find a body, you know? 
 Those woods are wild with animals that would've tore it up. 
 My guess? 
 If you don't find your missing kid in three days, you'll be looking for a body.

 He kept track of every bird he saw. 
 I, uh...

 That's nice. 
 May I ask you a question? 
 What made you so suspicious of Samuel? 
 One night, I walked into Daniel's room. 
 Daniel was on the floor doing his homework. 
 Samuel was spooning him. 
 It was just so inappropriate. 
 I kicked him out. 
 A week later, Daniel disappeared. 
 Samuel threatened to sue the cops for harassment, so they backed off. 
 We didn't care about getting sued, so we followed him for months. 
 We were... 
 obsessed. 
 - Where'd he go? 
 - Work and home. 
 That was it. 
 I still don't understand. 
 How does someone do that to a child? 
 Truth is that there is no answer. 
 After it happened... 
 in the mornings when I went into the kitchen to make the coffee, there was this moment.
