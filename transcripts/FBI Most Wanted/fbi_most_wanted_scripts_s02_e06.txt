 Did I miss a house meeting? 
 We're supposed to discuss these things. 
 It's only temporary. 
 I have a plumbing issue in my apartment. 
 Welcome. 
 Don't touch my juice shelf. 
 Okay. 
 :   a.m. this morning, foreman arrives at Rushing Meadow Farm in Somerset, Pennsylvania, and finds the front door of the owner's house broken into. 
 He goes inside to find this. 
 Victims are Jack Cartwright, very successful proprietor of the farm, and his   -year-old son, Eric. 
 That desk has been ransacked. 
 Could be someone was looking for money. 
 And murdered them both to get it. 
 There's more. 
 Eric is Jack's son from his first marriage. 
 Eight years ago, Jack then remarried Amelia, a schoolteacher from New Hampshire. 
 She adopted Eric, and then they had a six-year-old daughter named Gracie. 
 Both the mom and the daughter are missing. 
 So it's a home invasion turned double murder turned double kidnapping? 
 Correct. 
 And this is who we're looking for: Samuel Rutledge, years old, recently paroled after serving nine years on an aggravated assault charge at the State Prison for Men in Concord. 
 Somerset PD found his ankle bracelet with the strap cut in two five miles from the Cartwrights' driveway. 
 Then about an hour ago, surveillance cam at a gas station in Nashua caught this. 
 That's Sam in the passenger seat. 
 Who's his partner? 
 That's the owner of that van, another ex-con on parole named Peter Timmons. 
 He did five years at Greensboro Correctional in Manchester on a drug charge. 
 Wait, they weren't in prison together? 
 No. 
 All we know is, they were in New Hampshire, they drove     miles through five states to commit these crimes, and now they're on their way back. 
 So why target this family? 
 Why kill the two men, take the mom and daughter? 
 Maybe they didn't get what they wanted. 
 Amelia and Gracie could be collateral. 
 They could also be human shields. 
 Amber alert go out? 
 Yes, and a BOLO on the van. 
 Okay, I found their connection. 
 The monitor on that ankle bracelet traces to a parole officer named Barry Sands. 
 According to the New Hampshire DOC, he was supervising the both of them. 
 Excellent. 
 Where is Sands' location? 
 Concord, same as Peter's last known. 
 I'm not seeing anything for Sam. 
 Okay, let's split up. 
 Barnes and I will talk to the parole officer. 
 Crosby, check out Peter's apartment. 
 Hana, follow up with Forensics. 
 Make sure they're processing the scene, for touch DNA. 
 Amelia and Gracie are only useful to these two until they're not. 
 Soon as that happens, they're both dead. 
 Tampering with a GPS monitor is a felony in this state. 
 Sam's looking at another three years in lockup. 
 Well, I'm guessing that's the least of his worries, given the murders and the double abduction. 
 You sure Peter was with him? 
 Yes. 
 Didn't know they were pals. 
 Were their appointments at the same time each week? 
 Yeah, every Tuesday. 
 Sam at  :  , Peter at  :  . 
 Our fugitives met in your waiting room. 
 Sam is what we call an NH, "not human." If the system writes you off as a monster, why bother acting like anything else? 
 And Peter? 
 Never violent, not even when his wife served him divorce papers in prison. 
 He has an ex-wife? 
 Linda Carroll. 
 Remarried some wealthy real estate guy. 
 But Peter found religion in prison. 
 He forgave her. 
 Wanted to start a new family, a new life on the up-and-up. 
 So if Peter wanted a second chance, why would he risk everything to help Sam? 
 Love, s*x, money, or sport. 
 We don't have an address for Sam. 
 He's only been out six weeks.

 My guess is, he's planning on coming back.

 That way, she's an easier target. 
 You're saying Peter's not leading this? 
 He might've killed Sam, but Amelia's calling the shots. 
 This was never about the money. 
 This is about Amelia's need to control the men in her life. 
 We have an address for David?

 David? 
 We thought he lived here. 
 He does, but he's disappeared. 
 He went to work this morning, but the school said he never showed. 
 I've been calling his cell for an hour, and he's not answering. 
 What's going on? 
 We're looking for a woman who's been abducted. 
 We think your brother might be involved. 
 Amelia Cartwright? 
 That Amelia? 
 No way. 
 David would never hurt her. 
 He's been in love with her his whole life, even after what she did to him. 
 The accident on the bridge? 
 It was no accident. 
 We were at our house out on Lake Eden for the summer. 
 I was there. 
 And what happened? 
 Amelia was egging him on. 
 She told David if he loved her, he'd prove it and jump. 
 - She push him? 
 - She didn't have to. 
 My brother was so obsessed with impressing her, he decided to dive. 
 Ripped both his shoulders apart      and ruined his football career, all because of Amelia. 
 Maybe he's finally looking for payback. 
 You don't understand. 
 Amelia has this power over men. 
 It's like, the worse she treats them, the more they like her. 
 I'm sorry she's missing, but David wouldn't take her. 
 He's probably out looking for her himself. 
 All right. 
 Well, thank you. 
 Oh, whatever happened to your family house on the lake? 
 We still own it. 
 Why? 
 Just curious. 
 Thanks.

 Why would Amelia go back to the scene of the accident? 
 [TENSE MUSIC] 
 Her brand of psychopathy requires reinvention to survive, and reinvention requires cutting all ties to the past. 
 Isn't going back to the lake house the opposite of that? 
 Not if she's returning to cleanse her original sin. 
 First she took care of the husband and the stepson. 
 And Sam, but she didn't know him. 
 What about Peter? 
 Mm, depends if he's still useful or not. 
 The perpetrator becomes the victim. 
 Wonder if the same holds true for David Collins.
