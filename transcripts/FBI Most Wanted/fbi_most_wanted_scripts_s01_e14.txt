 They call it "a bank robbery gone wrong", except we did everything right. 
 Us getting picked up was just... whatever, dumb luck. 
 Is that what you call it, old-timer, dumb luck? 
 Mostly just dumb. 
 It's just messed up, you know? 
 People are gonna look back at this thing me and my dad did and not remember it for what it was... the perfect crime. 
 Pop? Pop, you all right? 
 My dad's not breathing! 
 Hey, oldtimer. 
 Stop the van! Hey! 
 Hey, can you hear me? Pop? 
 Stay back, okay? 
 Hey, you okay? 
 What are you gonna do to him? 
 All right, relax. And what are you gonna do... 
 Dad! 
 You coming? I'm out. 
 Wrap it up, Stevie. 
 What do you want to do with these guys? 
 I'm sorry. Are you waiting to order? 
 No, no, no, sorry. Already did. It's all yours. 
 I got myself in a rut... found the crab dumplings and refuse to stray. 
 What would you do to shake things up? 
 It depends. How do you feel about spice? 
 I don't mind a little heat. 
 Hey, Dad. 
 Looking at the fish. 
 He keeps telling me that the young one's sick. 
 I think he's just sleeping. 
 Hmm. LaCroix? 
 Yeah. Thanks. 
 Bon appétit. 
 She liked you. Who? 
 The blonde lady. 
 I think she was gonna ask you out on a date. 
 I don't think so. 
 Did you want her to? 
 LaCroix. 
 Our newest poster boys are the father-and-son team of Blake and Steven Wilson. 
 They were on their way from Minnesota to Connecticut to face charges for a bank heist in New Haven. 
 They overpowered the guards and left them for dead in a van, which was found next to an abandoned barn in Woodbridge, shot point-blank with their GLOCK 19s. 
 We have footage on the New Haven bank job. 
 The skinny one with the .45, that's sonny boy Steven. 
 The rifleman with the linebacker build, that's Blake. 
 He's been in and out of prison his whole life for bank robbery. 
 He just completed a 12-year stint last year. 
 Wasted no time getting back in the saddle. 
 Steven's story? 
 Kid's 18... no record. 
 Until Daddy came back into his life. 
 What's that on the security guard? 
 A bomb vest... that's how they managed to get into the vault. 
 They got away with just under a million in cash. 
 They were caught two weeks later at a fishing resort in Minnesota. 
 Rob a bank, go fishing. Talk about living the life. 
 Well, their plan was to escape across to Canada, but young Steven decided to splash out on a couple of $1,000 escorts. 
 He got drunk. The cops were called. 
 Blake would've known better... career criminal, hardened ex-con. 
 How were they planning on crossing into Canada? 
 With two expertly forged passports. 
 If Blake's looking to get out of the country again, he's gonna need another 50 for new passports... maybe more. 
 Won't be long till they're robbing banks again. 
 Let's get some TECS border stops, BOLOs, photos to all ports of entry on the northern border. On it. 
 Kid might be looking to get off the train. 
 Killing guards... likely the Dad's handiwork. 
 Stevie was just a college boy in it for the money and the party girls. 
 Might not have bargained for this kind of violence. 
 We have any family he might reach out to? 
 A mother in Bridgeport. 
 She left Blake 12 years ago when he was sent away. 
 This is unbelievable. 
 His father's got him mixed up in murder now? 
 Listen, Stevie was never in trouble until Blake came looking for him when he got out of prison. 
 What was Stevie doing back then? 
 He was trying to get into Trinity College. 
 He didn't get into any of the colleges he applied to, so backup plan was to take community college courses and transfer. 
 Doesn't sound like you had much faith in the plan. 
 Stevie's ego is fragile. We just have to support him. 
 We being? Oh, me and Wesley, my oldest. 
 Just finished his PhD in sustainable energy from Stanford. 
 That's a tough act to follow. No one expected him to. 
 I always told Stevie he's gonna make his mark another way. 
 Stevie was six when his father went into prison... young enough to think of his dad as a hero. 
 Would Blake exploit that? He would've. 
 And I was 17 when we met. 
 Promised me the world. 
 Only thing Blake loves more than stealing is philandering and fishing. 
 After a big score, he'd take off, wouldn't come back till he had his fill of walleye and loose women. 
 Even in prison... came to find out he's got pen pals, women. 
 I got my boys, and I never looked back. 
 Is it too late for Stevie? We'll know when we find him. 
 Oh, wait. This is Wesley. 
 I'm gonna take this. 
 Pen pals... maybe one of them's helping Blake on the outside. 
 Steven was in a vulnerable place in his life... rejected by colleges, a half-ass plan. 
 He would've been ripe for the picking by his old man. 
 Hey, boss, tracked down all of Blake's known associates... 
 All dead ends, literally. Blake's the last man standing. 
 I asked New Haven's DOC about Blake's pen pals. 
 There's one he's kept on the string for the last three years... she calls herself his fiancée. 
 Prison is sending us scans of their correspondence. 
 Ah, this I got to see. 
 Her name is Jeri Eaton... 
 28, lives in Cranston, Rhode Island. 
 "I experience with you a miraculous spiritual unity, a co-mingling of inner lives". 
 "Spiritual unity", fancy way of saying aiding and abetting a fugitive. 
 You see a free outlet anywhere? 
 Here, let me help you with that. 
 Why don't you shoot up a flare while you're at it? 
 Right, should've known better. 
 Yeah, well, that makes two of us. 
 About time. Sorry about that. 
 Maybe I shouldn't have brought him along. 
 He just wants to please you, Blake. 
 It's nice, isn't it? Hey, excuse me! 
 Case in point... I say, "Keep a low profile". 
 And what does that nimrod do? Hello? Hey! 
 Look, you deal with him. I'll be in the car. 
 Excuse me. You forgot my nuggets. 
 Hello? My nuggets? 
 Hello? Time to go. 
 They forgot his corn dog nuggets. 
 He's already pissed off at me enough as it is. 
 There's plenty of food where we're going... don't worry. 
 What? 
 Nothing, it's just... 
 I'm glad you're here. 
 I think you're really good for him... for both of us. 
 Come on. 
 Jeri's a true-crime fangirl... 
 Scott Peterson, Jeffrey MacDonald, Kenneth Bianchi. 
 She has a flair for the dramatic. 
 Blake wasn't her only prison pen pal. 
 Over the past five years, she's written letters to six other convicts. 
 Jeri, you minx. 
 But she's been Blake's exclusive pen pal for the past year. 
 Super says he hasn't seen Jeri in a week. 
 She's a good tenant, pays her rent on time and in cash. 
 Nice catch. 
 Walleye, good 15-pounder. 
 I'd be cheesing, too. 
 Crook with a heart of gold. 
 She and Blake must have had a little honeymoon before the New Haven bank job. 
 They even took junior along. 
 Maybe the next honeymoon's in Canada. 
 They'll need money for that. 
 You said she paid for her rent in cash? 
 They're gonna have to find that cash somewhere. 
 There's this. 
 "Here's a shot of you and Bill I thought you'd enjoy. 
 By the way, these are the November dates I need bartenders for. 
 I can do 500 cash each if you commit to all". 
 Letterhead says "Marley York Catering". 
 Caterer with a bunch of cash on hand. 
 _ 
 Got one bullet to the shoulder, another to the back of the head. 
 Multiple gunshot wounds across the back, both shot from behind probably while making a play for the door. 
 There's blood around her lips, no visible wound. 
 Maybe she bit one of 'em. Good for her. 
 Hopefully she gave one of them tetanus. 
 Looks like they found the cash. 
 And Chef York's wardrobe. 
 Oh, my God. 
 Jeri helped herself to a few dresses. 
 They snagged a few bottles of champagne on the way out. 
 Blood on the box could be the same person that got bit by the chef. 
 Blake is losing his grip... killing anybody that gets in his way. 
 If Stevie thought life with his dad was all fun and games, he's having his eyes opened. 
 He'll make excuses for his dad. I did. 
 First time my dad took me to the Saratoga Racetrack, I was 14. 
 By the fourth race, he was completely broke. 
 I had 20 bucks in my pocket from my paper route. 
 That went, but on the way home, I felt good about things. 
 I told myself, "My dad just showed me how important I was to him by borrowing money from me". 
 We found Chef York's cell phone on the floor of the closet. 
 Last outgoing call was at 9:16 this morning to a Boon Pharmacy in Cranston, Rhode Island. 
 Jeri's home turf. 
 Isn't this lace number a miracle worker? 
 You look great in anything you wear. 
 Isn't that right, Dad? 
 How's the hand? It's cool. 
 It's just a bite. I can take it. 
 You always were a tough kid. 
 Look, Stevie, uh... 
 I know it was hard, my not being around when you were growing up, but I appreciate the chance to make up for it. 
 Thank you, Dad. 
 Hey, how about we go down to the dock while there's still some daylight? 
 Yeah, sure. 
 No. 
 Don't. I know who it is. 
 You what? 
 It's a friend I called from the chef's phone, which I totally left behind. 
 I learn my lessons, babe. 
 If this friend of yours isn't right... they're dead. 
 We'll need plate readers on all routes in and out of Providence. 
 Wilson's smart enough to stay off the interstates. 
 Okay, so let's focus on Routes 6... 
 44, and 146. 
 What you got? 
 Yeah, Bethany Hogan, works in the pharmacy. 
 She went home sick three hours ago. 
 Took a first-aid kit and some pain meds with her. 
 Got ya. Let's go. 
 You really should take it easy with that. 
 Where's my manners? You want some? 
 Okay, but not too much. 
 Jeri said you were sweet. She was right. 
 Can you grab us another one? 
 I'm almost out, and your dad's gone flat. 
 You're not almost done. You're done. 
 Wha... I'm just trying to loosen you up. 
 Yeah, by bringing some stranger in here? 
 Look, if you're worried about me, I swear, my lips are sealed. No one's talking to you. 
 Babe, why can't we just have a nice time? 
 I tried so hard to make everything good. 
 Jeri, I swear... 
 And, hey, for the record, one of those bottles would run you, like, $200 in a restaurant. 
 Oh. 
 Oh, well that changes everything. 
 Here! Yeah, knock yourself out! 
 Don't look at me. 
 I can't believe what that son of a bitch just did to her. 
 Easy, that's my dad you're talking about. 
 Do you know how much she loves him? 
 She doesn't deserve that. 
 Roughly same age, same education. 
 Two years at UMass for Bethany, two at Tufts for Jeri. 
 But their paths do cross on Facebook Messenger where they dish about their shared passion, Love on the Inside, an online community who date the incarcerated. 
 All right, dating a convict. I don't get it. 
 You always know where your man is, that he's not up to something with your BFF. 
 Amen to that. It's safe. 
 No physical contact, no intimacy. 
 You think you matter in that convict's life. 
 Like a sheep matters to a wolf. 
 Convicts have written textbooks on how to work your prison bride. 
 So Bethany got invited to keep Stevie company while Dad and Jeri do their thing. 
 They got girls. They got champagne. 
 All Blake needs now is a place to cast a line. 
 Last ping on Bethany's GPS is 20 miles east of Providence. 
 It's right over the Massachusetts state line. 
 Long Pond Lake's nearby. It's known for its walleye. 
 Fishing camps, lake resorts. 
 On it. 
 _ 
 Flashing. 
 Go, go. 
 Still warm. Didn't miss him by much. 
 This is Agent Crosby. You did? 
 Okay. Where at? 
 Yeah, all right. Thanks. 
 They found Bethany's Prius about a quarter mile down the road hidden in the woods. 
 They must have taken off in Jeri's car. 
 The ice on the lake... it's broken up near the dock. 
 We got a body. 
 Bethany Hogan. 
 We got a DB in the water by the dock. 
 Used anchors down there. 
 Probably from those boats over there. 
 Tied it around her so she wouldn't float up. 
 Somebody didn't want her found anytime soon. 
 That was the intention. 
 The rope slipped, was poorly tied like this one. 
 A life-long fisherman like Blake would never have made this kind of mistake, would he? 
 No, he wouldn't. 
 He wouldn't let anybody else make it either. 
 Nope. 
 This wasn't Blake's play. 
 So what are we saying? 
 What I'm saying is it was Stevie. 
 He killed her. 
 I've been looking at this all wrong. 
 Damn it. 
 ME's preliminary on Bethany... blunt-force trauma to the back of the head, then drowning. 
 What's going on, bro? 
 I let my own history muddy my judgment. 
 It's all right here. 
 Two security guards in the van, both shot point-blank. 
 The whole point of firing at close range is a direct shot. 
 These shots were off the mark, indecisive. 
 The shooter hesitated. 
 Whoever grabbed York didn't have the muscle or the experience to control her. 
 They started shooting. 
 Ballistics found slugs all over the back wall of the kitchen, all from the same gun. 
 Panic fire. 
 This isn't the work of a hardened criminal. 
 This is Stevie making a mess. 
 He killed all these people in plain sight of his dad and Jeri. 
 Bethany... he strangled her, drowned her quietly, hid her body at the bottom of the lake, and then dumped her car far from the cabin. 
 He didn't want Blake and Jeri to know. 
 That's what I'm thinking. 
 It suggests that Blake is not too happy with Stevie's killing spree. 
 Perhaps there is tension between the two of them, maybe something we can exploit. 
 Okay, let's dig into that. 
 We don't need to worry about Bethany. 
 She's just not the type to... 
 Sneak out in the middle of the night? 
 We're fighting for our lives, Jeri. 
 That's the corner that kid pushed us into. 
 I know. 
 He's got me worried, too, but the kid worships you, Blake. 
 Yeah, he's a live wire, and he's in the way. 
 It's a cakewalk, just like you said. 
 It's all there... no guards, back exit. 
 So? 
 See you on the other side. 
 Everyone stays on the ground! 
 No one talks! 
 No one moves, and no one dies! 
 I said don't move! I'm not! 
 Not now! 
 You were just a second ago right over here! 
 I don't know what you're talking about. 
 Don't! 
 The alarm, bitch! Let it go! 
 Is that what you were stupid enough to do? 
 Leave her alone. 
 what the hell are you doing? 
 The big one emptied the drawer so fast. _ 
 I thought maybe he took the bait money. 
 He grabbed everything but. 
 Is there a back exit downstairs? 
 Not an official one. 
 There's a way out through the service corridor. 
 You remember anything else about the two men? 
 The big one wanted to go, but the skinny one wouldn't listen. 
 After he shot Ryan, the big one dragged him out. 
 Physically? Pulled him by the collar. 
 The big one was pissed. 
 That's it for now. Thank you. 
 Bank manager puts the take at around 11 grand. 
 That's 30 grand shy of what they need for those passports. 
 If the Wilson's make it that far, the family ties are looking thin. 
 Even with his son's antics, Blake is proving himself a total pro, avoiding the bait money, knowing about the exit. 
 Jeri was probably parked there in the getaway car. 
 Any video with a sight line to the back exit? 
 Got it right here. 
 Excellent. Let's get a look at her. 
 Now, I crosschecked the timecode. 
 You got Jeri starting to leave at the same time that Stevie shot the employee, so I'm guessing Jeri heard the shot and panicked. 
 She was gonna run, but then changed her mind. 
 But her impulse was to run. 
 She had enough of the gangster life. 
 Maybe we can get her to run again. 
 The website she and Bethany were on... 
 Love on the Inside. 
 Yeah, yeah, does Jeri still log on to that? 
 Uh, last time was yesterday. 
 She's not posting but reading about other ladies and how they're living it up with their bad boys. 
 All right, well, we're gonna assume she doesn't know Stevie killed Bethany because Bethany's about to reach out to Jeri and coax her away from Blake. I'm liking this. 
 You would. 
 All right, hard sell the story about Blake driving Bethany away. 
 "Hey, Jeri, sorry I cut out on you, but I was forced to by Blake, who"... 
 "Forced himself on me". "And that's why I took off". 
 "Fearing for my life and yours". 
 "I'm ready to go to the police". 
 "But I won't do it unless I know you're safe". 
 "I'm here for you, Jeri". 
 "Just name a place to meet". 
 Works for me. 
 Send it. 
 It's Tali. 
 She said they went back to the Chinese place but didn't see my girlfriend... sad face. 
 She is a funny one. 
 She is. 
 Seriously, bro, you might've missed an opportunity. 
 Ah, I don't think so. 
 Tali was there. 
 If I had have responded, it might've been difficult for her. 
 I don't know about that. 
 Tali actually might like to see you out there. 
 I think my folks would be okay with it, too. 
 I wouldn't know where to start. 
 Well, there's dating apps, but everybody wants a guaranteed outcome. 
 That ain't living. 
 No, it ain't. 
 So what do you do? 
 Tried and true... be nice, friendly. 
 Be open. 
 It's Jeri. 
 "Bethany, I've thought seriously about what you said. 
 I'll meet you tomorrow at 9:00 behind Garden City Plaza". 
 Jeri, I'm Agent LaCroix of the FBI. 
 I'd like you to come with us, please. 
 Oh, she's on the move! 
 Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. 
 Let me go! Hold on. Hold on. 
 Where's Bethany? That bitch lied to me. 
 Let me go. Easy, lady. 
 We're not trying to hurt you. Come take a look! 
 We got a tarp, hacksaw, garbage bags. 
 And in the glove compartment... 
 Jeri had a going-away party planned for Bethany. 
 I didn't want to meet Bethany, but Stevie made me. 
 He wanted me to kill her to shut her up. 
 Stevie told you to kill her? Yes. 
 I wouldn't have gone through with it, but I'm scared of Stevie, and so is Blake. 
 I mean, after seeing him kill four people... 
 You know? 
 Five people. Stevie already killed Bethany. 
 And you're lying to us. 
 Nobody sent you to the Garden City Plaza. 
 You resented Bethany for threatening the fantasy you'd created around Blake. 
 But then there's Stevie. 
 We saw how you almost drove away when you heard the shooting in the bank. 
 You wanted to leave because of Stevie, but you couldn't 'cause of Blake. 
 Whether you agreed to the murders or not, you're an accomplice. 
 If you cooperate, maybe we could work something out for you and Blake. 
 You might even get out of jail at the same time, be able to pick up where you left off. 
 Who gave Blake inside information on the bank in Rehoboth? 
 Uh, this guy in New Haven. 
 I don't know his name, but we went to his place just before. 
 So you can lead us to him? 
 It was at night. Blake was driving. 
 He said the guy owed him $100,000. 
 He told me to knock on the door. 
 It was a blue door. 
 He answered, and then Blake and Stevie pushed in. 
 Great. What'd he look like? 
 He was black, hefty. 
 He had a hearing aid on his left side. 
 Blake sent me back to the car, and I waited till they came back, and then the next day, they hit the bank. 
 And what about the 100,000? 
 I don't think they got it. 
 If they did, they wouldn't need to rob anybody. 
 Because they had enough for the passports? 
 Blake's heading to Canada, yes? 
 It's too late to hold out on us, Jeri. 
 Blake knows these people... the Albanians, he calls them. 
 We gave them $10,000. 
 They said we had two days to come up with the rest. 
 How much is the rest? 
 50,000. 
 These were found in Jeri's purse... photos for the fake passports. 
 Looks like Stevie is the odd man out. 
 Blake's cutting him loose. 
 Probably not until he's got the money for the passports. 
 At least one more bank robbery. 
 The bank job they got arrested for, the one in New Haven three months ago, netted them what? 
 Uh, they cleared almost a mil. 
 
 
 
 And they were caught with 840 grand. 
 And take away the 50k for the passports. 
 Right. 
 That still leaves 100 grand unaccounted for. 
 Money they might've paid to an inside man for information on the bank job. 
 Can you cue up the New Haven bank job? 
 Yeah, give me a sec. 
 Blow it up. Play it back. 
 Mm-hmm. Real slow. 
 He's bleeding... from a blown eardrum. 
 That's our man. 
 Good. 
 _ 
 FBI, freeze! 
 Get up! 
 We'll take that as an admission of guilt, Mr. Green. 
 It's an admission of nothing. Okay, it was a panic attack. 
 I have PTSS to this day because of that bank robbery. 
 Come on, Mr. Green, Blake Wilson's girlfriend described you. 
 She described your house. What are you talking about? 
 After your injury, Tilling Security gave you a desk job at their corporate office. 
 Come on, come on. 
 You have intel on dozens of banks. 
 I didn't help Blake Wilson. 
 Don't make us look for your cut from the New Haven job. I spent it, all right? 
 I bought my mom a new condo, but I didn't help Blake Wilson. 
 I helped Stevie. 
 You helped Stevie rob banks? 
 Me and Stevie used to work at a club up in Hartford. 
 I did security. He bused tables. 
 When I got the job at the bank, Stevie started telling me about his pops, how he was getting out of jail and how he thought he could talk him into hitting my bank. 
 It was his idea? He reached out to Blake? 
 Yes, all he talked about was his dad, how he wanted to be just like him. 
 He said it was in his blood, for God's sake. 
 Got to admit... 
 Blake's pretty good. 
 He came up with the whole bomb vest thing. 
 It was pretty slick, right? 
 And when Blake found out you had no money left? 
 I thought he'd kill me, but Stevie stepped up for me, and that's what saved me. 
 I just had to give up some information on some banks. 
 How many? 
 Three. 
 It's been almost 36 hours. 
 What are the Wilsons waiting for? 
 They should've struck by now. 
 Maybe Blake figured we got to Jeri. 
 It's got him spooked. 
 Spooked or not, they need money to get out of the country, and they're running out of time, not to mention his trigger-happy son is probably pushing him to do something. 
 Maybe it's a bank we missed. 
 Maybe it's one they already scouted. 
 When would Blake have found the time? 
 He did a bank job as soon as he got out of jail, and he's been on the run ever since. 
 Maybe it's Stevie. 
 He's been wanting to fill his father's shoes since way before Blake got out of prison. 
 It was in his blood? 
 Maybe he struck out on his own while he was in Hartford... get some work experience. 
 Can you pull up the... Bank robberies in Hartford. 
 Yeah, while Stevie was living there. 
 Two... all suspects in custody. 
 And an attempted robbery at the Green Mountain Savings and Loan. 
 Suspect got away. 
 Here he is. Could be him. 
 Looks like he lost his nerve. 
 But he would've done his homework on that bank... research that'd come in real handy right about now. 
 Call Hartford PD. Get 'em out to that bank ASAP. 
 And let's get the bird fired up. 
 Have him lock the door. Get up, get up! 
 Get up now! Lock the door! 
 Quickly! Okay. 
 It's locked. 
 Get on the ground! 
 What do we do now? 
 About 30 minutes into the standoff. _ 
 We've made at least two bad guys through the windows. 
 Area's secure. Snipers are in place. 
 Gonna join you guys on top. Good. 
 We have a hostage negotiator on site? 
 Lieutenant Thomas, State Police. 
 Agent LaCroix. Any contact? 
 We've been trying... nothing but silence on the other end. 
 We got shots! We got shots fired! 
 We'll shoot one every half hour until our demands are met. 
 We'll call you back with a list. 
 May I? 
 I said we'd call you back. 
 Steven Wilson, this is Agent LaCroix of the FBI. 
 I'm taking over these negotiations. 
 You need to listen to me very carefully. 
 No, you listen to me. 
 You're not dealing with the State Police anymore. 
 This is the FBI, so you're gonna have to put your big-boy pants on, Stevie. 
 I will not consider any of your demands until you let us remove that person from the front of the bank. 
 This is a serious negotiation for your lives and the lives of your hostages. 
 I will not let you turn this into a spectacle. 
 Are we clear? 
 Okay, go ahead. Take the body. 
 I don't care. 
 Good. Get him out of there. 
 Now, I don't believe your father's with you. 
 I don't think he trusts you anymore since you botched that job last year and you lost your nerve. He trusts me. 
 He's here. We're in this together. 
 Prove it. Put him on the phone. 
 The FBI wants to talk to you. 
 Blake Wilson? That's right. 
 Who's this? Agent LaCroix. 
 You know we have Jeri Eaton in custody? 
 Yeah. 
 You curious to know what's happening with her? 
 No. 
 Passport. 
 Well, thanks to Jeri, we're all caught up on who's behind the body count. 
 And killing the hostage... that was Stevie's idea? 
 Yeah. 
 Now, you know I know there's no way out of there alive unless you play this as smart as I think you are. 
 Well aware of that. 
 Let me offer you a way out. 
 Okay. 
 But you heard my son. It's do or die. 
 Just can't be any other way. 
 Let me come in and negotiate. 
 Okay. 
 Let's get wired up. 
 You sure? 
 Sounds like Stevie wants to go out in a blaze of glory. 
 Not Blake... I don't think he can shake his son without some help. 
 It's done. 
 Thank you. 
 Hold your fire! Agents going in! 
 We want a car to the airport and a chopper to anywhere we want. 
 I can't do that, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. 
 You release the hostages, and I'll secure an exit for one of you. 
 Which one of you, you can decide. 
 That's up to you guys. 
 There's only one criminal we want. 
 You really think I'm just gonna leave my dad behind? 
 Stevie, look at me. 
 Look at me, Stevie. 
 I'm not afraid to go back. It's what I know. 
 No, there's got to be another way. 
 There isn't. You heard him. 
 He's willing to do the time. 
 I robbed you of a real father, and I'm not gonna take away your future, too. 
 Just take the deal. I can't do that to you. 
 Damn it, Stevie! 
 Why can't you just do what I say for once? 
 How in the hell you think we got into this mess in the first place? 
 Look, I know I screwed up, but from here on out, I'm not letting you down, okay? 
 No deal. 
 I'm offering you a way out. 
 You're willing to die to save your father from going to jail? 
 Damn right. You're a good kid, Stevie. 
 Better than he deserves. 
 Did he tell you what he had planned? 
 Did you tell him? 
 Jeri led us to the Albanians who were making passports for your father. 
 There's two passports here. 
 One for Blake... 
 And there's another one here for... 
 Well, you tell me. 
 There's no passport for you, Stevie. 
 Jeri told us that Blake was planning on killing you before he got to the border. 
 No, no, nobody was gonna kill you. 
 No, the plan was to come back for you. 
 Stevie. 
 I-I... 
 Whoa. Don't do it, Steven. 
 Nobody needs to die here. Just give me the gun. 
 Oh! God! 
 You stupid... what'd you do that for? 
 You were really just gonna get rid of me? 
 I should've walked away when you came looking for me. 
 This couldn't have worked out worse if I tried, you weak, pathetic... 
 Don't do it Steven. 
 I know you want to, and I know why. 
 I'm gonna go away for the rest of my life no matter what, so why not? 
 Because then I'll have to kill you, and I don't want to do that. 
 Trust me, he's not worth it. 
 I would've done anything for him. 
 I know. I hear you. 
 All he does is take... from you, from your mom. 
 But you kill him, he takes everything. 
 You hear me, Steven? 
 Steven, do you hear me? 
 It's better for him to live with what he's done. 
 We're clear. 
 We're clear. We're clear! 
 Get up! 
 Well, you got me out alive. 
 Trust me, it wasn't your life I was trying to save. 
 Looks like Blake's gonna pull through. 
 Somehow I'm not relieved. 
 You know, the second time I went to the track with my dad, I wanted to go. 
 I wanted to be like him with his pals and his world. 
 He started losing, as usual. 
 Got drunk, as usual, and blamed me for his bad luck. 
 When I saw Stevie's picture, I thought to myself... 
 "I know this kid". 
 Five homicides later... 
 We all got blind spots, bro. 
 You still got the job done. 
 I'm heading up. You coming? 
 No, I'm gonna sit for a bit. 
 I am done for the night, Pete. 
 You mind checking on my to-go order? 
 Yeah, sure. 
 What'd you order? 
 The salmon. I was gonna order that. 
 Any dessert? Tiramisu for my son. 
 How old? 
 14 going on 40. 
 Likes it with his decaf cappuccino in the morning. 
 I'm usually up and out by the time he gets up, so... 
 Restaurant opens that early? 
 No, I teach special education. 
 Really? 
 Well... that's important work. 
 And what do you do? 
 Um... 
 I'm in law enforcement. 
 Hmm. 
 Wouldn't have taken you for a cop. 
 What would you take me for? 
 I don't know. A philosophy professor. 
 Maybe in another life. 
 Here you go. 
 Thanks, Pete. 
 Have a good night. 
 Lovely talking with you, Professor... 
 Jess. 
 Leslie. 
 Have a good rest of your night. 
 You too.
