 Previously on "Finding Carter". 
 It's our anniversary. 
 You asked me what I wanted, and I said just to wake up with you. 
 It's not gonna happen, is it? 
 (Elizabeth) It's gonna happen. 
 He asked me out on a date. 
 I was hoping that we could do something. 
 Oh. 
 The only thing I really want is to be at home with my real mom. 
 That's all I want, too. 
 So, you are into me. 
 Max, what's wrong? 
 You had me scared out of my mind. 
 Carter? 
 Meet me here tomorrow night. 
 Tomorrow? 
 (Knocking) 
 Happy Birthday. 
 My birthday? 
 Today's my birthday? 
 It's 6:06 a.m. 
 You are exactly 17 years old. 
 What happens now you... 
 We wait 25 minutes, then we wake up Taylor. 
 But until then she gets to sleep? 
 'Fraid so. 
 Even then, she was smarter than me. 
 (Chuckles) 
 Do we really have to do this right now? 
 It's so early. 
 I will still be 17 in three hours. 
 Come on, girls, let's do this. 
 (All) Surprise! Happy Birthday! 
 Happy Birthday! 
 Okay. So, what would you like? 
 I've got bagels, I've got fruit, and I am taking orders for eggs. 
 Scrambled with cream cheese, please. 
 You don't get to pick first. 
 It's not your birthday. 
 Maybe they'd like to open some presents first. 
 Um, let us discuss. 
 Do you get this every year? 
 No. This is usually the worst day of the year. 
 It's the annual reminder you weren't here. 
 I've always dreaded my birthday. 
 Okay, well, I can top that. 
 I didn't even know today was my birthday. 
 ♪ There you go ♪ 
♪ There you stay ♪ 
♪ Keeping low ♪ 
♪ Never wanna play ♪ 
♪ You've been up and down, down ♪ 
♪ You've been low, low, low ♪ 
♪ Pretending to not feel alone ♪ 
 So, you've been celebrating your birthday on a different day? 
 Yeah, I just turned 16 like six months ago. 
 Weird. 
 What day? 
 It's no fun in there without you. 
 Here they are. 
 You know what? The last time you two celebrated a birthday together you were three years old. 
 Oh. 
 Oh, yeah. 
 Yeah, and you carried me around on your shoulders. 
 You remember that? 
 Yeah. 
 Yeah, you said it was so I could be as high as a balloon. 
 Oh, sweetheart, you make me feel very special. 
 Oh. 
 Well, you were... uh, you are. 
 Buddy, you have to come over more often. 
 Yeah, I don't even remember that. 
 What about me? 
 I mean, do you remember anything about gammy? 
 Was I wearing a plaid dress? 
 You were. 
 I-I have a picture of it. 
 Uh, it's in my wallet. Where's my wallet? 
 No, let's... let's wait on that. 
 Let's enjoy this moment. 
 Do you remember the day they were born? 
 It was the best day of my life. 
 Okay if I eat this in my room? 
 I can still see you holding one in each arm. 
 "Do as you please, Grant." 
 You know, after 14 years, you girls deserve a birthday party. 
 (Grandpa) Sure. 
 Um, I would love a party. 
 Yeah, I'll, um... I'll text my friend Bird. 
 She'll send out the bat signal. 
 Yeah, let's talk about what you're gonna wear tonight. 
 Okay. 
 Well, let's talk about the most perfect gift, for the most perfect birthday presents. 
 Oh, a Macy's gift card. 
 Thanks. 
 Now you can go get yourself something fabulous for tonight. 
 Thank you. 
 That means new, something without holes in it. 
 Right. 
 And, you, slinky, sexy... It wouldn't kill you. 
 And some shoes, too. 
 There's plenty on there. 
 So, now, let's... let's eat. 
 Okay. 
 Can I talk to you a second? 
 Sure. 
 What did I do? 
 I don't know. 
 I'm trying to figure that out. 
 Your husband has been asking me all kinds of questions about some spa package that I got at a silent auction that... 
 Oh, my God, what did you say? 
 No, it's fine. 
 I rolled with it. 
 You "rolled with it"? 
 Are you cheating on David? 
 Is there somebody else? 
 Mom, it's very complicated. 
 Please tell me you're seeing someone else. 
 What? 
 Nothing would make me happier than if you finally unloaded this loser. 
 If you need me to cover for you, I'll do it happily. 
 Just, please, no more silent auctions. 
 I cannot have people thinking I go to silent auctions. 
 I... 
 What else is a mother for? 
 I'm pretty sure not that. 
 Okay, I have to get ready for that birthday party. 
 Oh, you think you're doing that birthday party in those drabby drabs? 
 No. In fact, you know what? 
 I'm getting my credit card, and you're going shopping with the girls. 
 We can pay for our own clothes, Joan. 
 Can you? 
 Hey, hey, you want a donut? 
 Mm-Hmm, mm-Hmm. 
 Thank you. 
 They're really good. 
 Love a good donut. 
 Mm, so good. 
 Carter, you want one? Mom? Mom, where are you? Oh, my... I can't believe you did this. Of course. It's my absolute favorite day of the year, the day you made me a mother. (Both laughing) And we feel so lucky to have our whole family under one roof. Mom's making a toast? So blessed. There's champagne in it. Okay, anyway, I just wanted to say thank you for making me a mother and Elizabeth. For God sake's, enough already. She's your mom. Call her mom. Mom. Don't use that tone. Cheers. Anyway, let's toast. (All) Cheers. Happy Birthday. Cheers. Excuse me. Happy Birthday. (Knocking) Um, just a sec. You with a hidden suitcase, that's never a good sign. (Sighs) I saw my mom. Around here she's known as "the kidnapper". Does this mean you're leaving? Going back to her? Tay... When? It better not be today. I told you I didn't know about today. But now you do, so can you reschedule devastating your family? It's not up to me. Yes, it is. It's totally up to you. It's clearly not up to me or Grant. Is there anyone whose opinion matters to you? You don't think this is hard for me, too? It's really hard, Taylor, okay? But I can't stay here and be with my mom at the same time, okay? I have to choose. So, you could do that? You could spend today with us, have us throw you a party, pose for pictures, and then let us wake up tomorrow morning and relive that nightmare. I'm sorry. I don't give a crap if you're sorry. Answer the question, could you do that? Because if you can, then... then you must really hate us. (Sighs) Clearly there's nothing I can say. Yes, there is. "I'm staying." (Scoffs) Everyone always says it's so great being a twin. They wouldn't say that if they had to be your twin. (Sighs) Tay, come on. All right, fine. But you're missing out on some really cute dresses. I think Max would really like this one. How are things with you and Max? What difference does it make since you won't be here tomorrow? You guys finding anything you like? Um, yeah, tons of stuff. Yeah, yeah. Who else knows? Max. He met Lori at the Quick-and-Easy where he works, which he was not happy about. And this was yesterday? Mm-Hmm. And he was texting you? Yeah, like a hundred times. Oh, and Crash was with me, so he met her as well. Well, at least she didn't kidnap you. I guess that's an improvement. Taylor, I don't want you to hate me. Stay and I won't hate you. I can't stay. And I could walk right over there and tell mom, and then you'd have to. What about Grant? I can't think about Grant. You guys ready to try on some stuff? Should we even bother? Well, we're here. Fine. Guys, let me see. (Carter) I'm not ready yet. (Taylor) Yeah, me neither. We cannot leave this store empty-handed. I found something I like. Good, let's see. Taylor, you look beautiful. I really like it. You have to wear this to the party. Oh, I think I found my dress! Great, come out. (Chuckles) Okay, no contest. You win. You both look spectacular. I want you to have it. Tay, no, come on. Yes, it's your last... Your last what? It's your last time I'm ever gonna be this generous to you. Okay, you're both getting the dresses. No. Oh, no, come on. That would be pretty humiliating. Way too humiliating. Come here. Come here. What? Oh. Last time you had a birthday party... Together, you both wore the same dress. Tay, be my twin again? Please? Okay. I'm gonna go get dressed. Can I hold on to this for a sec? Yeah, yeah. I just wanna look at it. Thanks. Hey. Hey. Chinese for dinner? Uh, the place with good scallion pancakes? Oh, you got it. Oh, um... I need a baby picture of me for school. They're doing some section in the yearbook. Do you have one? A baby picture? Oh, honey, don't you remember when this building flooded a few years back? No. Well, I had all the pictures in boxes in the basement. They all got destroyed. All of them did? Okay. I do have one picture, but it's my only one, so I would absolutely have to get it back. Okay. Mm-Hmm. Oh. How have I never seen this before? Why is it laminated? I wanted to protect it, you know? (Elizabeth) Carter? Uh, just a sec. I can't remember the last time I was this happy. You're a great mom. It's really nice to see you happy. I was just telling her what a great mom she is. I don't know what's gotten into her. Thanks for showing me this. Oh, yeah. Hey, um, do have any other baby pictures of me? Oh, Lord, boxes. Anytime you wanna see them. As soon as we get home? Yeah. ♪ (Knocking) Who is it? Max. Hey. Look at these. Look how cute I was? Oh. Oh, yeah. That's the cutest one. That's Taylor. Hey, can we talk about what happened last night? Yeah. What did you decide? Obviously, I'm going. Okay, then, this is a very important conversation, because I strongly feel you should not go. You know what, Max? That's not really your decision. Yeah, I know, this is up to you. But I know things that you don't know, which I believe would influence your decision. Okay, well, you know what? You're not gonna change my decision. So, if it's something I wouldn't wanna know, please just don't tell me, Max, if you're truly my friend. You know what? That's not fair, that's a trick sentence. Carter? Oh, hi. Hi. Listen, we got a situation... I told her. You think she should go? No. Yeah. (Sighs) Do you know I recently saw Lori right outside of your house? What? Max, I just asked you not to say anything. (Whispering) I'm not talking to you. I'm talking to her. And she was there yesterday at the Quick-and-Easy. Yeah, I kinda figured that. Which is, sorry, why I couldn't talk to you. I really wanted to talk... No, it's fine, I understand. I'm just upset that it doesn't seem to matter what I think. Yeah, and it should, 'cause you're her sister. And today's our birthday. You would leave your twin sister on your birthday? Oh, I'm sorry, are you talking to me now? You said I couldn't say anything to you if I'm your friend, so I didn't. But I also can't be your friend if you're with Lori, so where does that leave me? In my room. Yes. Your room. (Low bass music) Okay, it's been half frosted. Hello. May I take your coat? Hey, whoa. That shirt looks great on you. Oh, yeah. Better than it does on me. Keep it. Oh, no, no. I-I mean I really do like it, but... No, seriously, that shirt is dead to me. Thank you. Hello. May I take your coat? Yeah, thank you. Thanks, man. Really? Oh! For goodness sakes, Grant. How hard is it to hold coats? Oh! Buddy, would you please help? Well, I-I just got some cheese, honey. Oh, here, let me. Oh. So sweet. Thank you. Wish all men could be like you. Oh, don't let her fool you. She tells that to all the guys when she first meets them. Go eat your cheese. Thank you. I'm Crash, by the way. Oh, C... that-oh, that's a very sexy name. I can't believe I said that. I'm Joan, the girls' grandmother. Oh, no, you're not. Yeah. And... oh, oh, this is my daughter, Elizabeth. Oh, yeah. It's nice to see you. Thank you for welcoming me in your home. Where should I put this? Oh, oh, oh, yes. Uh, in the office at the end of the hall. Oh, right. Thank you. Yeah, my pleasure. What a darling young man. Hey! Look who's here! Oh, the girls are coming down. Birthday girls! Gonna get this. Hi. Oh, don't they look pretty? ♪ Really? No, dad. Get a picture. All right. (Camera shutter clicks) Okay, smile. One more, one more. (Cheering) Okay, done, done, done. Hey. Come here. Hey. So, what'd you decide? Oh, um... I think I'm gonna go with my mom. That's awesome. Really? Okay, you're the first person who thinks so. I-I-I wanna come with you. What? Yeah. Crash... I'm leaving tonight. Well, then we better make plans. He's a drug dealer, she's a kidnap victim. Add a dystopian society, and that could be a best-selling Y.A. Trilogy. That's a potentially huge idea. Could you remember that for me? Uh, yeah, could you maybe just remember your own potentially huge ideas? Are you busy doing something else? Why am I not in a corner, making out with somebody? You can make out with me. Oh, Bird. 
 
 Hey, Gabe, nice to have you here. Let me take this. Oh, thank you. Well, you know this place. Go and make yourself at home. All right, appreciate it. All right, dad. Have fun. Hey. May I take your coat? Uh, I'm not staying. I-I just wanted to see you, make sure we're okay. Are we okay? Kyle. Hey. Glad you could make it. You gonna take his coat? No, he said he couldn't stay. Come on, you gotta stay. No. Come on, have a beer, one beer. Uh... Come on. One beer. Uh, yeah, okay, I'll have a beer. Hi. Hey. Hi. Happy Birthday. Wow. You look amazing. Thanks. Hey, man, how come you're not playing video games with Grant? 'Cause I'm not. 'Cause he's with me. Really? When did that happen? You know, I'm sorry, I cannot fill out your questionnaire today. Right. Shall we? Why are we in your closet? I'm doing a little test. I wanna see how long it takes before someone notices I'm gone, then comes looking for me. So, you left the birthday party to come throw yourself a pity party? Not to scare you, but this is my idea of fun. Cheers. Hey. So, this is where you're hiding. Hey. Can I have one of these? You want a baby picture of me? Yeah. Yeah, you have that effect on me. A different person... We want different things. Real things. You... Us. Crash... I really want you to come with us, but... I can't see any way how that's possible. What're you talking about? Your mom's been running all this time. She's obviously great at it. No, it just feels wrong. And it would be really, really dangerous for you to come. Wrong and dangerous, two of my favorite words. I being serious, Crash. Okay, so am I. Look. You decided to go. Your life, your decision, right? Right. Same with me. My life, my decision. Plus, you're looking at all the possible bad things. What about the actual good things? You'll be with your mom, and we'll have each other. What else do you need? Nothing, I guess. ♪ Hello? Grant? Shh. Shh. Shh. Grant? Oh, very nice. Oh, yeah. (Gunshots) What's going on? He's playing my video game. He's going to screw up your score. What am I supposed to do? Hey, ass wipe! Did you just call me an ass wipe? No, that was my girlfriend. You have a girlfriend. Don't sound so shocked. Of course, everybody's got a girlfriend. Well, I'm having a pity party if you wanna come. Sure, why not? Carter, oh, my God! What? What's wrong? What's wrong? You're leaving. Bird. Who told you that? Crash. What? Oh, my God, I told him not to tell anyone. Why is he being so stupid? He didn't. Just me and Ofe, okay? Oh, great, Ofe knows. Okay, wow. I can't wait for my face to show up on some fun novelty pool. I want you to stay. But... but I know you have to do what you have to do. I want you to have this. Bird, I can't keep this. It's a friendship bracelet. No, those are made of threads, not gold. And are those diamonds? (Laughs) Carter, I know we would've been lifelong friends. And, eventually, I would've given you something like this, but this is my only chance, so keep it, please. I feel stupid now, 'cause I just got you one of those keychain bop-it games. It's been an honor and a privilege to be your friend, Carter. Stop it. Stop talking about me in the past tense. Shoot me, I'm sorry. I don't know proper fugitive etiquette. You sure you wanna take off? We're having cake in a minute? Thanks, I gotta get going. Thanks. Hot date? I wish. Right. Too bad Elizabeth is stuck here with her family. What do you mean? What do you think I mean? Hey. You leaving? Yes. Good to see you, Kyle. All right. He knows. What? He knows. What do you mean he knows? (Elizabeth) Okay, my son's room? (Kyle) Your husband knows that you and I are having an affair. What did he say? What exactly did he say? I can't remember, he came out of left field. He asked me if I had a hot date, and I said no. And he said, "well, it's too bad" that Elizabeth is stuck here with her family." It's not like he said, "Kyle, I know you're sleeping with my wife." Trust me, Liz, he knows. Can we... And now... so do we. Come here. ♪ Don't you have to go? Not yet. You gonna wait till I fall asleep? Tay... Sorry. It was a great birthday, even if it's the only time I got to celebrate it. What was your favorite part? Macy's, when we both came out in the same dress, and you tried to convince me that it looked better on me. (Chuckles) And, um, what'd you wish for when we blew out the candles? Not to lose you. ♪ We could use a little saving ♪ 
♪ Maybe you could forget what I said ♪ 
♪ And just hold me instead ♪ (babies crying) So, these are all the new little people who were born on your birthday. Aren't they beautiful? My favorites are the chubby ones. I love chubby babies. Was I a chubby baby? Oh, you were so chubby. Yeah? Did you wrap me up like a burrito like that? That's called "swaddling," and, no, you hated it. So, which one you want? What? You get to take one home. That's your birthday present. That's what you're always asking for, right? Yeah, so, which one is it gonna be? A sister or a brother? Mm. What about that one with the funny ears? His parents probably don't want him anyway. Mom, don't say that, that's horrible. Or this one. Look at her name. Agatha. Oh, we give her a new name, and she will have a whole different life. No, I know who I want. The twins. Wouldn't that be great to be a twin? So, when did you think your birthday was? Um, May 5th. May 5th? What? What's wrong with May 5th? Did you ever read dad's book, "Losing Lyndon"? No. Or any article at all about your kidnapping? No. Look, I know I was kidnapped. I don't need to read about the search parties or how they dredged the lake and how scary and awful it all was. You know how I told you my birthday was the worst day of the year? Actually, it was the second worst. The worst day was May 5th. Carter, you haven't been celebrating your birthday. I've been celebrating the day I was abducted. (Sighs) (Knocking) Carter, you startled me. What are you still doing up? I saw my mother. That's all right, you can tell me. And she's waiting for me to run away with her. She thinks you're coming. I told her I would. But... but now I... Now you don't want to? I don't know what I want. But... I can't make this decision. Where were you gonna meet her? She said it was good for one call just in case I hit a snag. (Sighs) I hit a snag. But I can't call her and tell her I'm not coming. You don't have to. Yes, I do. Yes, I do have to call her. I have to call her. But she'll be hurt and upset. And it might be the last time I ever hear her voice, and I'm scared that I'm gonna say, "I love you," and she's not gonna say, "I love you more," and... And I can't, I just can't. I can't. It's okay, it's okay, it's okay. It's gonna be okay, I promise. How? I will take care of it. I'm your dad, and I will take care of it. How? Well, I can't tell you. It's the dad code. Now, listen, you are too tiny to carry this enormous burden. Give it to me and trust me to take care of it. Can you do that? Okay. Hey. (Sighs) Did you have fun at the party? No. Grant, did you hear something? Something that upset you? Yeah. Well, it's not true, okay? No, it's not, I'm not leaving. I'm not going anywhere. Whoa, whoa. You were gonna leave? Yeah, isn't that what you heard? No, I just heard that now. But you were gonna leave? No, I'm not, I'm not leaving. That's good. I'm gonna need you. We're all gonna need you. Why? Forget it. It's probably just the sugar talking. Okay. Night, Armadillo. Night, Elephant. And go to bed. (Sighs) Quite a day. Yeah, long. Like the day they were born. Yes, that was a long day. Oh, my God, twin girls. Who knew life could be so good? Little did we know. I feel like it could be good again. Interesting you should say that. Uh, why do you say it's interesting I should say that? I wanna talk to you about a conversation I had today. Uh-huh. Lori Stevens has returned. What? She was planning to take our daughter away again today. It's all right, no, don't worry. Carter is here. She had the chance to go with Lori. She chose us. She chose us. What's this? It's where she is right now. Lori? Yeah, waiting for Carter. I was thinking what a surprise it would be if you showed up instead. (Whispering) As much as I wanna get this woman, David, I cannot be the person to arrest Lori. I promised Carter. Well, call the precinct. Notify the FBI. This might be the only chance we get. She chose to stay with us. Do you know how big that is? I'm okay with that. Are you sure? Absolutely sure. In that case... Shall we call her and tell her Carter's not coming? Can I see this? So, if I press this button, I'll... You'll be talking to the woman who stole our daughter. (Phone dials) Carter, Carter, is that you? It's Lori, I can't. Carter? It's not Carter, it's her father. David. You wanna talk to Carter? That's obviously not gonna happen. She doesn't want to talk to you. That's why I have the phone. She asked me to say goodbye for her. Don't underestimate me, David. You made that mistake once before. By the way, I've notified the police. They'll be there any minute. Yeah, well, you never were a very good liar. Goodbye, Lori or Janet, or whatever you're calling yourself these days. You were amazing. Was I? Yes, yes. Thank you, for choosing us. This decision must have been very hard. I didn't want you to regret it. I don't. Mom's having an affair. It's not true. I'm very, very sorry. I will do anything. Will you? Are you sure you wanna do this? Yes. If you can just let me explain myself. Explain what? Carter Stevens, you've been charged with grand larceny. Bird, tell them. It never ends. The lies. Carter, come on. When are you going to realize you've got people here who love you. Get the hell out of my store. Crash lost his mind. This isn't a game anymore. We haven't wrapped around our little thing here. You are a mess. I'll never forgive you. I hate you. Get out of my room.
