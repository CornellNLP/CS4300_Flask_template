 Previously on "Finding Carter"... 
 What, you never heard of a girl who came home after being abducted 13 years ago? 
 Who's that? That is a blond-haired, blue-eyed piece of raw sewage. 
 I didn't get your name. 
 Carter. 
 Here we go. 
 (Whispering) You like him? 
 You're smart, and you're nice. 
 Beautiful. 
 (Elizabeth) 
 You can never have anything to do with him again. 
 Do you understand me? 
 Do you understand me? 
 ♪ 
♪ You've got me lit up with a look of love ♪ 
 Whoa... art. 
 Wow... looks like a real gallery opening. 
 Feels like I should be in the library, studying for Latin. 
 I'll meet you after. 
 Tay, come on. 
 Bird has a really big piece in the show. 
 Congratulate her for me. 
 She told me she wanted you to be here. 
 She wants everyone to be here. 
 Hey, you're here! 
 (Ofe) Hey, Carter's here. 
 Carter... great, you're here. 
 Why does it matter if I'm here? 
 We don't know... Bird said nothing could happen until you got here. 
 Let's get some food. 
 Yeah. 
 Yeah. 
 Somebody is dying to meet you. 
 So these people aren't your friends? 
 No, I'm not really part of the artsy-fartsy crowd. 
 Oh... well, we didn't really have one of those at the school I went to. 
 It was... it was more gunsy-knivesy. 
 I'm not really part of any crowd. 
 I'm not too fond of crowds myself. 
 I feel like if you pick right, you know, one's enough. 
 You're surprisingly quotable. 
 I... I read a lot of t-shirts. 
 This is Carter. 
 Carter, this is my art teacher, Ms. Freen. 
 (Freen) Hello. 
 I think it's time. 
 Are you ready? 
 I think so. 
 Everyone... (Claps hands) 
 If you'll gather round, please. 
 I want to congratulate all my wonderful artists. 
 One of you chose to wait to unveil her... 
 Well, I may be biased, but I really do think it is a masterpiece. 
 Bird. 
 (Applause) Thank you, Ms. Freen. 
 Now, I don't know about "masterpiece," but it is a tribute to a very special friend of mine. 
 I know most of you probably know her story. 
 Carter Stevens. 
 (Applause) 
 Carter, you're an inspiration to all of us. 
 But especially me. 
 You didn't know this, but... 
 You're my muse. 
 (All murmuring in shock) 
 (Uncomfortable laughter) 
 What the hell, Bird? 
 ♪ I shut it out of my mind ♪

 No, I wouldn't say I don't like it. 
 I'd say I hate it.

 You guys saw it. What did you think? 
 I liked it. 
 Shut up, you did not. 
 I did. 
 Kind of looks like half her face is rotting away. 
 You wouldn't put it in your kitchen. 
 Oh, that sounds so cool. 
 Could we go by the high school after dinner? 
 I wanna see it. 
 Well, you can't, 'cause I had someone take it down. 
 Pretty much just snapped her fingers. 
 Okay, you don't understand because it wasn't your face on the wall. 
 (Taylor) Oh, poor you. 
 Everyone knows who you are. 
 They clap when they hear your name. 
 You're a "muse." 
 And do you think I like that? 
 Do you really think I want that kind of attention? 
 Well, I just don't really think you'd like invisible land. 
 All right, you know what... get back to me when the people you thought were your friends start treating you like a career move. 
 Who wants to change the subject? 
 I do. 
 You know, most people think that humans descended from apes. 
 When, actually, we just share a common evolutionary ancestor. 
 So the African apes, like the chimpanzees and the bonobos and the gorillas, they're really just our cousins. 
 How cool is that? 
 You said change the subject. 
 That's one of my favourite subjects. 
 That's why I was offering it up. 
 We can talk about it... 
 We could talk about that. 
 Or we could talk about you two getting a car. 
 (Taylor) What? 
 Um... yes? 
 (Laughing) Are you serious? 
 That's awesome... I can't compete with that. 
 That's great... we'll just look into it to see how we can make that happen. 
 Ah, it'll be used. Nothing fancy. 
 No, it doesn't have to be fancy! 
 You can start with this. 
 Give me a page. 
 Okay, we'll circle the ones that we like. 
 (Giggling) 
 Ah, it's great to see those two getting along like that, isn't it? 
 Oh, I'm sorry, you care about what I think? 
 Because it doesn't feel like you do. 
 If I'm not back in two days, send a search party. 
 That's a strange thing to say in this house. 
 Strange... yet typical. 
 I'm looking for ways to help them bond. 
 Carter's been home a little while. 
 They still seem like strangers. 
 I... thought if they had to share a car... 
 It's a great idea... I agree with you. 
 But we can't make it happen right now. 
 Lizzy, I'm talking about a clunker. 
 We can't even afford the cars we already have. 
 As it happens, I'm expecting a rather large pay check. 
 What? Great! 
 Why don't you tell me these things? 
 I don't even know what you're working on. 
 That's my process. 
 Too many things have fallen though. 
 I don't like to talk about something unless it's real. 
 And... this check is real? 
 This check is real. 
 When's it coming in? 
 Soon, very soon. 
 But the point is, you don't have to get bent out of shape at the idea of buying the girls a used car. 
 I definitely will feel better if we have some more money coming in. 
 Oh, you'll feel better. A lot better. 
 A whole new level of better. 
 Okay, stop taunting me. 
 Why can't you just tell me? 
 'Cause it's so much fun to taunt you. 
 (Students chattering) 
 I bet you she came back in the middle of the night and put it back up. 
 No, she wouldn't dare. 
 See? Told ya. 
 You were saying? 
 (Paper tearing) 
 Carter... Carter, stop! 
 You have to go to class. 
 This is gonna take all day. 
 Possibly longer. 
 It's like this on every floor. 
 You haven't seen the gym. 
 I don't get it. 
 Why would she even paint something so horrible in the first place? 
 And now this? 
 I thought she was my friend. 
 (School bell rings) 
 Hey, you guys go. 
 I'll help her. 
 Thank you, Gabe. 
 You'll never get this done at the rate you're going. 
 (Paper tearing) 
 No problemo. 
 Give me something hard to do. 
 (Squeak) 
 Ohh... 
 Oh, no. 
 (Whispering) What the hell? 
 Okay, okay, I can fix this. 
 Max? 
 Hey... 
 Hey. 
 Are you doing our laundry? 
 Yeah. 
 I wanted to show you guys how much I appreciate... 
 Everything. 
 You know, letting me stay here and... 
 That is so sweet. 
 So... so keep that in mind when you... 
 Um... 
 This happened how? 
 Forgot to check all my pockets. 
 Some candy that was... 
 That's just chocolate. 
 I just... I... 
 Well, you know what? I can just redo 'em. 
 No, no, no. No, no. Thank you. 
 It's just... it's better off if you just stay away from the washing machine altogether. 
 I'm sorry. 
 (Sighs) 
 It's okay, I know your heart was in the right place. 
 Yeah, I'm... 
 I'm probably not. 
 What do you mean? 
 Just clearly not the ideal house guest, and I think this is a sign it's time for me to go. 
 Well, Max, I really liked having you here. 
 I mean, the last five minutes haven't been great, but the... most of the time... 
 I've gotten totally spoiled by Taylor's cooking. 
 And Grant... 
 He's like my best friend now. 
 But I think... 
 You can stop worrying about Carter. 
 I mean, she has friends here, she has family. 
 Does she know that? 
 Not yet. 
 But she'll figure it out. 
 (Chuckles softly) 
 I'm really gonna miss you. 
 Are you, though? 
 No. 
 (Chuckles) 
 Yes. 
 Whew! 
 Well, that was tough. 
 But I think we got 'em all. 
 Hey... 
 Yeah? 
 Thank you. 
 Yeah. 
 You're welcome. 
 Oh, my... 
 (Sighs) 
 Bird! Did you see where she went? 
 Bird! 
 Oh, for... 
 Excuse me... 
 Did you see where she went, the girl who put these up? 
 You can't just leave them up here. 
 You're gonna take them down, right? 
 Oh, my God. 
 (Whispering) 
 What's the matter? 
 Did the world stop revolving around you for one second? 
 Bird, I thought you were my friend. 
 I just spent six hours... 
 I thought you were mine! 
 And nothing? 
 I got a kiss. 
 A kiss? She kissed you when she wasn't high? 
 You're out of the friend zone. 
 You're moving the ball down the field. 
 No, it was a kiss, but it wasn't a kiss. 
 You know what I mean? 
 Actually, no. 
 (Bird) Stop ripping them! 
 I'll do it. 
 Stop! 
 Get off! 
 No, get off of me, you bully, you! 
 (Overlapping shouting) 
 Let me explain myself! It's humiliating! 
 What are you talking about? 
 Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! 
 This is humilliating! 
 You guys, stop! 
 What are you talking about? 
 Do you even know what that means? 
 Bird! 
 All I wanted was a nice little student art exhibit. 
 You girls are not the show. 
 Stop making it about you. 
 And... get this place cleaned up. 
 Your work here is done. 
 Okay. 
 You two, go home. 
 I'm sorry. 
 I spent six hours taking these down. 
 Don't bitch at me. 
 I was here all night putting them up. 
 Yeah, I'd be mad at me, too. 
 Really? 
 (Sighs) 
 I can't stand up in these heels.

 Like a brother now. 
 I know, and I'm like your sister.

 No...

 No, but... um, close call.

 Why are we all talking in this weird voice?

 Hey, Carter, it's me. 
 Sorry, I couldn't stick around to say good-bye, but you know I suck at good-byes. 
 But, uh, but this isn't good-bye, 'cause I'll see you soon. 
 So, um... anyway, hey, never change. 
 All right? 
 Bye. 
 Hey... 
 Please move. 
 It's you, isn't it? 
 You're blocking my door. I have to go. 
 Lori, I know it's you. 
 Hi, Max. 
 My disguise du jour. 
 Obviously, not a very good one. 
 Just... really sick of wearing wigs. 
 Isn't it dangerous for you to be here? 
 It's dangerous for me to be anywhere. 
 At least here, I could see her. 
 How is she? 
 She's Carter. 
 You know, she is who she wants to be whenever she wants to be it. 
 You know what I mean? 
 I do. 
 The thing I'm most proud of in this world is being her mother. 
 I miss being her mother. 
 She refuses to call Elizabeth that. 
 (Laughing) 
 I'll bet that drives Elizabeth insane. 
 Nah, she... she gets it. 
 She just wants Carter to be happy. 
 She let her keep that name, even though it's not her real one. 
 Yes, it is. 
 Although she will have to change it when we're back together. 
 What, you mean you're getting back together? 
 Of course, Max... what did you think? 
 You mean... but when? 
 I mean, how are... how are you gonna do it? 
 I'm... I'm working on it. 
 I-I... it's taken longer than I wanted. 
 I couldn't believe the red tape to get a new identity. 
 Fingers crossed, I'll have everything set in the next two weeks, and she can leave all of this behind, like the nightmare I'm sure it's been. 
 But she can't know any of this... okay? 
 Including that you saw me. 
 Not until everything's ready. 
 Promise me. 
 I promise. 
 Listen, you gotta be more careful. 
 I mean, if I can run into you, that means anybody can... That's including Carter. 
 Yeah, well... 
 Max, you didn't exactly run into me. 
 I kind of... followed you. 
 From where? 
 From the house? 
 Lori, you were right outside their house? 
 I know I'm pushing it, it's just... 
 Every day is harder. 
 You think it's gonna get easier, but it doesn't. 
 And if it's like this for me, what must it be like for her, I ju... 
 I can't stand the thought of her suffering. 
 I wouldn't... 
 I wouldn't say she's suffering. 
 It's okay, Max. 
 (Sniffles) 
 All that matters... 
 Is that this is almost over. 
 (Sighs) 
 (Birds chirping) 
 (Sighs) 
 Wow... (Chuckles) 
 Doesn't look like anyone even lives here. 
 Ah, that's the look my parents are going for. 
 Tasteful abandonment. 
 So they're not here? 
 Ah, let me check. 
 Ah, money in an envelope usually means they're out of town, and... 
 (Sighs) 
 Judging by the amount, looks like they're gonna be gone for a while. 
 Um, do you want to order something? 
 Sure. 
 At my house, this qualifies as a cookbook. 
 Okay, we have Chinese... 
 American... Italian... 
 Don't you get lonely? 
 Lonely? 
 Well, I have my two best friends. 
 Vodka... and fudge. 
 Okay, you know what? 
 We're going to my place. 
 Bye, guys. 
 I'll see you later. 
 (Laughing) Okay, let's go. 
 ♪ 
 Grant, disgusting! 
 Now nobody can eat that cheese but you. 
 That was the plan, Stan. 
 I'll grate some more. 
 Hi. 
 Hi! 
 Uh, is it okay if Bird stays for dinner? 
 Sure... 
 Yeah, there's plenty. 
 Hello again. 
 Now, you're the one that painted that picture of Carter, right? 
 Yeah. 
 Oh, that was you? 
 Oh, that was so cool. 
 Can you paint a picture of me with my face rotting off? 
 I'd love that so much. 
 Oh, my first commission. 
 Hey, thanks for coming to the show, by the way. 
 I didn't even think you knew I was there. 
 Oh, I knew, I just didn't want to intrude with you and J-May. 
 Who's that? 
 J-May? "John Mayer"? 
 Don't you think Max looks exactly like John Mayer? 
 Good for you, girl. He is super-fine. 
 Did something happen with you and Max? 
 What's going on with you and Max? 
 No, nothing, stop! 
 I liked it better when he thought I didn't exist. 
 Oh... mm. This looks good. 
 Okay... everyone's responsible for their own cheese. 
 (Carter) Can we eat? I'm starving. 
 No, we have to wait for your father. 
 No need! Where have you been? 
 I have been dealing with a transportation issue. 
 Ohh. 
 No... 
 Tay... 
 No! 
 No! 
 (Carter) Yes? Okay. 
 (Taylor) Are you serious? Let's go see! 
 I call shotgun. No, way, let's go see! 
 Come on. 
 Oh, my God, this is... 
 
 
 
 You're very lucky. 
 You have a great family. 
 Yeah, well, you came on a good night. 
 So does this mean that you got that check? 
 Uh, not yet. 
 David... 
 But soon. 
 Define soon. 
 Soon is... soon. 
 Unless "soon" means "now," we have a problem. 
 This is our bank balance. 
 Come, take a look. 
 You see this number? 
 Is that enough to pay for the car that you brought home tonight? 
 No. 
 Okay... 
 So then, now... 
 This number no longer exists. 
 Now, I can't pay for our mortgage or electric bill, credit card bill, water bill. 
 So do you see how "soon" doesn't really help us now? 
 You don't have to be sarcastic. 
 I don't know what I have to be to get you to understand that we can't afford this car. 
 You have to return it. 
 I can' it's used I'd get pennies on the dollar. 
 Oh, my God. 
 But if you could just trust me... 
 That things are gonna be fine. 
 Can you do that? 
 So here we are again. 
 No. 
 You said that I would never have to make this call. 
 You don't have to. 
 And I won't. 
 I won't, David. 
 Just give me something, anything. 
 Just tell me what you're working on, and I won't ask another thing from you. 
 What are you writing? 
 It hurts that you don't believe in me. 
 Well, David... 
 It hurts you think that belongs on top of the list of things that hurt. 
 (Phone beeps) 
 Hey, mom... it's me. 
 (Motor humming) 
 So, have you, uh, remembered anything else? 
 Besides me, your old pop-pop? 
 (Chuckles) No, not really. 
 Guess I'm kind of starting over. 
 She's doing very well. 
 She's making all these new friends, and she's very much the social butterfly. 
 Good! 
 I'm glad to hear that. 
 This one always has her nose in a book. 
 You're only young once, you know. 
 (Buddy) Unless they're like you... 
 Who's forever young. 
 Oh, please, buddy. 
 You know, I'm gonna give you the name of my dermatologist. 
 Mom, I have a dermatologist. 
 Ah... oh... 
 Wouldn't have known. 
 Well, I'm, uh... 
 Sorry that David couldn't join us today. 
 He probably could. 
 Just afraid to show his face. 
 Mom, please. 
 Sorry, kids. 
 Sometimes, I'm so used to speaking my mind, I forget I'm supposed to be polite. 
 There is a lot to be said, though, for being free to speak your mind. 
 Dad, the kids probably would love a golf cart ride. 
 Oh! 
 Yeah, that sounds fun. 
 Well, let's do it. 
 Wow, never thought I'd see the day I felt sorry for Elizabeth. 
 If you really want to make grandma happy, call her "gammy." 
 Well, listen, thanks for lunch, gammy. 
 Oh! "Gammy"? 
 She called me gammy! 
 I heard. 
 That was your baby name for me... gammy! 
 You remembered gammy! 
 Gammy and pop-pop. 
 Oh, this is my moment, okay? 
 You had yours. Let me have mine. 
 All right, let's let gammy have her moment. 
 Mom, that's so sweet. 
 I am so glad that we came to see you today. 
 Oh, me, too. Me, too. 
 My head is so dizzy, I forgot what we were gonna talk about. 
 Um... 
 David and I thought that the... the girls should have a car. 
 Oh... oh, absolutely. Absolutely. 
 Nothing fancy. Something used. 
 Oh, don't be ridiculous. 
 They're gonna want something... 
 Kicky and fun. 
 You know, I'll put the money in your account, but you let them pick it out. 
 That's very generous, mom. Thank you. 
 And tell 'em it's from gammy. 
 (Knock on door) 
 (Typing) 
 (Knock on door) 
 Come in. 
 I just wanted to let you know that it's done. 
 I even got us a little breathing room. 
 She's sending us money for a new car. 
 But if she ever asks, I'll just tell her that the girls preferred a car they didn't have to worry about if it got dinged. 
 (Sighs) 
 Well, you'll be able to pay them back soon. 
 Please... I'm sorry. 
 I just need you to stop saying the word "soon." 
 Lizzy, I can see I'm pushing buttons here. 
 I'm not trying to. 
 I'm hyper-aware that I've not been pulling my weight around here. 
 Not for a long time. 
 I've never brought that up. 
 No, I appreciate that. I do. 
 But I've been working hard, very hard. 
 Things have fallen through. 
 I've lost confidence in myself, and I know... 
 I know I became less appealing to you. 
 David... 
 I want to make it up to you. 
 It's all I've been thinking about. 
 And I'm about to, very close. 
 Buying the car, that's what that was about. 
 I was feeling good about myself again. 
 More than anything, I was hoping that that would... 
 Help how you feel about me. 
 I'm happy that you feel good about yourself. 
 It's just... 
 The way you talk about me, it doesn't sound like I'm your wife. 
 It sounds like I'm your accountant. 
 Okay, well, I, um... 
 I'm gonna go to work for a little bit, clean up some paperwork. 
 Okay. 
 I'll see you when you get home. 
 (Whispers) Yeah. 
 (Indistinct chatter) 
 You got it. You got it. 
 Thanks man. 
 (Phone ringing) 
 Hey. 
 Hey. 
 You're not supposed to be here. 
 Paperwork. 
 Seems like you want to be alone. 
 I do, thanks. 
 You know, I just want to say... 
 Before we were anything, we were friends.

 Everyone, I helped Taylor make the sauce. 
 It's penne ala vodka. Mmm. 
 She brought the vodka. Obviously. 
 (Laughter) It's really good. 
 Is your family not joining us? 
 Both my parents are at work, and Grant's holed up in his room, binge-watching "Lost." 
 Oh, do that kid a favour. 
 Just go in there and say, "they're dead." 
 (Laughter) 
 Save him a lot of heartache. 
 (Laughter) God! 
 I'm not kidding. 
 So you're like throwing a whole dinner party for us. 
 Yeah, thanks, Tay. 
 I didn't invite anyone. 
 I... thought maybe you did. 
 Mm, no, it wasn't me. 
 It was me. Yeah, it was me. 
 So this is your dinner party. 
 Except it's at our house, and we cooked. 
 By "we" you mean me. 
 (Door opens) Yes. 
 (Laughter) 
 Hope there's room for one more. 
 (All) Max! 
 Well, that was a lot better than the greeting I got at home. 
 Totally J-May. 
 (Snickers) What are you doing here? 
 I just got your good-bye message. 
 No, no, I said it wasn't good-bye. 
 And it's not, I'm... 
 Actually, I'm moving here. 
 You are? 
 Really? That's so cool. 
 I don't know, well, my parents, they said I could live wherever I want, as long as I support myself, so I thought, why not see if there's a job around here? 
 And there was. 
 So I'm a manager now. 
 Yeah, over at the Quick-n-Easy off of route 7. 
 Wait, they made you manager already? 
 Yeah, well, the guy who owns the place, he's super nice. 
 He tells everyone they're the manager. 
 Oh... 
 Where you gonna stay? 
 I was hoping I could stay here. 
 Just for tonight... I mean, I'll look for something tomorrow, if that's cool. 
 Yeah, sure. Of course. 
 Course it's okay. 
 I want to sleep over, too. 
 Oh, um... sure. 
 Okay. 
 What? 
 I feel left out. 
 What about us? 
 Do you feel left out? 
 Yeah, a little bit. 
 We all could sleep over. 
 Um... yeah. 
 That'll be fun. 
 When did this become her house? 
 Seriously, you'd understand if you saw her house. 
 Okay, wait... you still have to let me set this up. 
 Okay? I'm really good at this. 
 I just need all the sheets you have in the house. 
 Oh... they're in the hallway closet upstairs. 
 Yeah, I'll show her. 
 Cool... help me move the furniture? 
 Yeah. Ofe? 
 (Ofe) Yeah, sure. 
 Can I talk to you? 
 Uh... sure. 
 I'm gonna stay here and eat this, if that's okay. 
 It's really good. 
 Mom is gonna freak out when she sees this.

 Then Bird wanted to stay over, and then everyone wanted to stay over. 
 And, uh... well, I guess now you're all caught up. 
 Looks like fun. 
 Not too much noise. 
 This does look amazing. 
 Maybe we should keep it up all the time.

 Your mom is here. 
 You want to find your mother, ask a cop. 
 You'll get a lot more out of her if you start acting like a friend. 
 Or even her daughter. 
 I'd actually really love to come with you to a crime scene one day. 
 Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! 
 You ever played seven minutes in heaven? 
 That spin doesn't count. 
 Yes, it does.
