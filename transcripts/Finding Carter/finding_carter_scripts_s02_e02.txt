 Carter : Previously on "Finding Carter" 
 I couldn't get pregnant. 
 And we decided to look for an egg donor. 
 Lori : They chose me. 
 I am your real mother. 
 (Panting) Ah! 
 Lori came to the house? 
 She gave me this picture of you. 
 I know things, David did a number on both of us. 
 She said something strange. 
 What did she mean by that? 
 (Clock ticking) 
 (Alarm sounding) 
 Tay? 
 Are you okay? 
 Yeah. 
 Yeah, I think so. 
 I don't know. 
 Been up all night thinking about everything. 
 Yeah, yesterday was insane. 
 Maybe we should take today off, you know, just, like, stay home and recover. 
 No, no, I think that we should just move on. 
 You know, not dwell. 
 I have a lot of stuff to do and I don't want to fall behind. 
 I have an e-contest this morning. 
 Okay. 
 You sure you're okay? 
 Yeah, I'll see you downstairs. 
 (Sighing) 
 I've got it under control. 
 Look, you... 
 You knew eventually it would come to this. 
 The truth has to come out. 
 Are you threatening me? 
 (Clock ticking) 
 I just don't understand how she found us. 
 I don't know, Linds. 
 It was 18 years ago. 
 But we signed a confidentiality contract. 
 I'm starting to think that we need to sue that clinic. 
 I just want to put all this behind us. 
 Every bit of it, finally. 
 Well, we're almost there. 
 The FBI's interrogating her tomorrow. 
 Are you gonna be there? 
 I don't know. I'm not sure how much more I can take. 
 She's delusional. 
 Like, that thing that she said about... 
 You knowing things that I would want to know. 
 Made up things from the mind of a very disturbed person. 
 I'll see you downstairs. 
 Hey. 
 Are you okay? 
 I don't know. 
 It's gonna take some time to get your balance back. 
 Dad... 
 There's this one thing that happened, it's been kinda bothering me. 
 Tell me. 
 When I woke up in the motel room, Lori was on the phone with someone. 
 I think someone was helping her. 
 Like who? Someone you knew before? 
 I don't know. 
 It sounded like someone she knew. 
 And... 
 Like someone who knew me.

 I don't know who she was talking to, I'm sorry. 
 It wasn't you, was it, dad? 
 Me? 
 Oh, my God, no. 
 I was looking for you, Carter. 
 I was frantic, like everyone else. 
 Okay. 
 Go can stop thinking about it. 
 You've been through a lot. 
 Yeah. 
 We all have.

 (Toaster rattling) 
 Hey. 
 Hey. 
 Do you want anything else? 
 Some eggs? 
 No, I'm good. But thank you. 
 Oh, we have stuff for waffles. 
 I haven't had waffles since I was, like, ten. 
 Oh. 
 Do you want a ride to school? 
 No, mom, stop acting weird. It's freaking me out. 
 The last 72 hours have been pretty weird. 
 I guess I'm a little off-kilter. 
 Weird is kind of an understatement. 
 I think it'd be great if we all just got back to normal, you know, stay on track. 
 Great policy. 
 Hey. 
 You sleep okay? 
 Yeah, you? 
 So-so. 
 Sorry. 
 Hey. 
 Max : Hi. 
 Morning. 
 Hey, Armadillo. 
 (Game beeps off) 
 Hey, isn't it a little early for murder music? 
 Not in this house. 
 Are you okay? 
 Mhm. 
 You're here, Taylor's here, Max is here. 
 That crazy woman's going to jail, right? 
 Mm-hmm. 
 Then I'm good. 
 David : Anyone need a ride? 
 Good. 
 Yeah. 
 How about you guys? 
 No, I'm taking him to physical therapy. 
 I thought you had econ. 
 Yeah, but I can take him and still make it. 
 Oh, that's okay, I can find my own way. 
 It's not a big deal. 
 You sure? I really don't want you to... 
 Yeah, Tay, don't worry, I got this. 
 Fine. 
 Take him. 
 Tay, cool? 
 Yeah, totally cool. 
 All right, see the rest of you later. 
 Elizabeth : Okay. 
 Bye. 
 Bye. 
 See you later. 
 Bye. 
 Mom? 
 Yeah? 
 Are you seeing Lori today? 
 No, but tomorrow, she's being interrogated by the FBI. 
 You think I could come to that? 
 What? No. Absolutely not. 
 Why? 
 Because I don't want you anywhere near her. 
 What? Is there... 
 Something you don't want me to hear? 
 Yes, her voice. 
 It's in the hands of the FBI, okay? 
 You're not going, there's nothing more you need to know from Lori. 
 Okay. 
 Bye. 
 Come on, Max. 
 It's the AP Microeconomics paper. 
 Oh. Here it is. 
 Axiomatic Theory of Expected Utility Equilibrium Strategies in Convex Compacts. 
 Uh, are you the one who said we should take this class? 
 Yes. 
 Okay, so, you really want to finish this project? 
 'Cause really, it's kind of, you know, lost its luster for me. 
 We have to finish this project. 
 It's more than half our final grade. 
 I didn't think you'd even be here today. 
 Why? Stuff to do. 
 Hey, I don't judge, you know that. 
 People handle issues the way they want. 
 I'm sorry. 
 I didn't mean to sound defensive, I just... 
 Everyone thinks the world should stop spinning, I don't get it. 
 Maybe they're just trying to process. 
 Well, this is my process.

 Oh, I'm... early. 
 I don't get why my mom won't let me hear Lori's interrogation. 
 She just doesn't want you to see how messed-up Lori is. 
 Okay, but come on, Max. 
 She wasn't always this messed up. 
 Remember, you knew her. 
 I don't know, maybe it's everything she's been through since I got back here. 
 Still. It doesn't explain why she took you in the first place. 
 Yeah. 
 Look, I know she's done awful things. 
 Believe me, I know she has, but I just want to know why. 
 Because okay, that stuff with the egg donor thing, there's so much more to the story than anyone ever told me. 
 And, like, why did she want to meet our mom and dad after? 
 She knew what she was getting into, she was an egg donor. 
 It's not like she put us up for adoption. 
 I don't know, I just... 
 I feel like there's more to the story. 
 I think Elizabeth is just trying to protect you. 
 Yeah, but that's the thing. 
 Protect me from what? 
 Liz? 
 Hey. 
 You did good, how you handled the whole thing. 
 Thank you. 
 It's just the family fallout, you know? 
 Yeah, well, kids are stronger than we think. 
 They'll survive. 
 It's just her. 
 Lori. 
 It's over but she's still stirring the pot. 
 What do you mean? 
 Nothing. 
 I was thinking I'd go to the interrogation tomorrow, save you the trouble. 
 Cool? 
 Yeah. It's cool. 
 It's very cool. 
 Thank you, Kyle. 
 Yeah. 
 ♪♪ 
 Hey. 
 Oh, my God. 
 Hey. 
 It's about time. 
 Hey. 
 Hey. 
 Okay, seriously. 
 Okay, seriously. 
 So we all agreed, when you were gone, we were all terrified. 
 Yesterday was beyond intense. 
 The whole news blackout thing? Freaky. 
 Okay, who's in charge of that stuff? 
 Bird, I'm trying to say something here. 
 Okay, sorry, go ahead. 
 Okay, I'll say it. 
 While you were gone, we realized the world would suck without you in it. 
 I mean, we already knew that, but a kidnapping really has a way of bringing it home. 
 Bird : Which is why I have a remedy for all that ails us. 
 You always do. 
 Let me guess. 
 A welcome back Carter party. 
 A fiesta, a  fête,  a festive gathering of kind folks who are relieved and grateful that you're back. 
 That's really sweet, Bird, but I don't know if I can deal with a whole... 
 No, you don't even have to lift a finger, because this happens to be one of my strengths. 
 Throwing parties and hiring people to do all the work. 
 Okay. 
 Gabe : Shall we? 
 Yes. 
 Welcome back. 
 I know. 
 I know, but... 
 It's cool. 
 Do you need a ride? 
 No, I don't need a ride. 
 Dude, you want me to call the cops? 
 No, just... 
 Just listen. I... 
 I need you to know that I know what I did. 
 I made a mistake. 
 That's an understatement. 
 Here, but I... look. I'm not that guy anymore. 
 What, the guy who tried to run away with my best friend? 
 Or the guy who asked me to give him money and then shot me? 
 Which guy aren't you anymore? 
 Neither. You'll see. 
 I don't want to see. 
 I want you to leave me alone. 
 How the hell did you even get out of jail? 
 It's legit, I have this uncle... 
 Forget it, forget it. I don't want to know. 
 Stay away from me. 
 I get that, but I need you to understand... 
 Dude, stay away from me! 
 ♪♪ 
 Apparently, the FBI does transcripts of all of their interrogations. 
 I wonder if I could get a copy of Lori's. 
 I don't get why you keep pushing this. 
 Okay, I am telling you, she was on the phone with someone in the motel room. 
 It was weird. 
 So what? 
 She was in cahoots with someone and they kidnapped you together? 
 Maybe, yeah. 
 Look, I don't know what's going on, okay? 
 I just... 
 I know there is more to this than my parents are telling me. 
 Sweetie, what you have is called  idée fixe. 
 Okay, you're maniacally preoccupied with an idea that has no basis in reality. 
 Did you just call me a maniac? 
 I guess I did. 
 What, you don't believe me? 
 I believe that you went through some hideous trauma and you need as much drink, dance and love as I can dole out. 
 Thanks, B. 
 You know I love you, right? 
 Like, no joke. 
 (Laughing) Good. 
 Now, get ready to party and stop thinking about the FBI, okay? 
 Okay. 
 Hey, hey! Put the keg over here. 
 ♪♪ 
 (Knocking) 
 You said Lori snuck into your house and took this picture of you. 
 She did. 
 I don't believe you. 
 Is this about the phone call in the motel? 
 No, not just that. 
 Dad, there has to be a reason she's doing this. 
 Why would she take me twice? 
 Why would she risk it? 
 And why did she suddenly decide she needed to tell us she was the egg donor? 
 I know her, dad, she is getting at something and I don't know what it is. 
 Lori is mentally ill. 
 Whatever led to her extreme behavior is something a psychiatrist is gonna have to solve. 
 Okay, but she didn't act crazy when I was growing up. 
 Honey, I don't know what made Lori the way she is. 
 Dad, I feel like you're not telling me something. 
 People don't just do things for no reason and I am trying to figure this all out right now so I can move on with my life, finally. 
 And you're not helping me. 
 Please help me. 
 Tell me the truth. 
 Was there something between you and Lori? 
 Yes. 
 Yes, there was. 
 Your mother and I were going through a tough time. 
 We weren't communicating. 
 I had a one-night stand. 
 That's it. 
 It was the biggest mistake of my life. 
 And then what happened? 
 Nothing. 
 I told her I'd made a mistake and... 
 And I could never see her again. 
 And I didn't... 
 Until you were found. 
 (Sighing) Why didn't you say anything? 
 After I got back. You must have known it was the same woman. 
 I knew it was the same woman, but I also knew I would do anything to make sure our family was finally gonna stay together. 
 Does mom know? 
 No. 
 Dad, she has to know. 
 You have to tell her. 
 Carter, look at what your mother, what all of us have been through. 
 Learning that I had an affair while the two of you were babies and that it turned out to be Lori. 
 That would destroy her. 
 You understand that. 
 I know your mom better than you do. 
 She is very fragile right now, more fragile than you know. 
 Okay, but now I know this. 
 Now I'm hiding this from her, too. 
 That makes me a liar. 
 You're not a liar. 
 You're holding sensitive and upsetting information and until the time is right, when it makes sense for her to hear it, from me. 
 But until then, this is between us. 
 You have to trust me on this. 
 This is not your burden to carry. 
 Ow. Mm. 
 Oh. 
 Oh, no. 
 Hey. 
 I thought we could do Taco night. 
 What do you think? 
 Mom, you don't have to cook. 
 Sure I do. 
 That's what moms do. It's a mom thing. 
 Well, we don't adhere to stereotypes in this house. 
 Plus, cooking's a Taylor thing, not a you thing. 
 What's up? 
 I just know that I almost lost you again. 
 It's hard for me to believe that the nightmare's over. 
 Yeah, I know. I can't stop thinking about it. 
 That's another reason why I don't want to go to that interrogation, I don't want to hear another word that woman has to say. 
 Okay, but... she's just gonna rant and rave, but none of it is going to be based on any kind of reality. 
 Which is? 
 Which is... 
 That you and Taylor and Grant are  my  children. 
 You're  my  kids. 
 There's no other fathers or mothers. 
 Nobody but us. 
 Just your dad and me and you kids. 
 Nothing else matters. 
 (Knocking) 
 Come in. 
 Hey. 
 Hey. 
 Mom's trying to cook again. 
 She's acting weird. 
 I was thinking... 
 Maybe you could talk to her. 
 Me? 
 Why? 
 Because she's worried. 
 She wants to make sure we know she's our real mom, okay? 
 No one else. 
 Of course she's our real mom. 
 She's our only mom. 
 Well, technically, Lori is our... 
 Please do not say that woman's name. 
 Fine. 
 But will you talk to her? 
 Reassure her? 
 I have homework to do. 
 She'll be fine, Carter. 
 She knows she's our mom. 
 Just move on. 
 Hey. 
 Hey. 
 Where have you been? 
 Just taking a nap. 
 How was physical therapy? 
 Not what I expected. 
 What do you mean? 
 I am feeling stronger already, definitely. 
 You coming to Bird's tonight? 
 I wish I could. 
 Ofe and I have to finish a project. 
 Oh, couldn't you do it this weekend? 
 I don't think so. 
 It's a school night and everything, so I get it. 
 Will you text me? 
 Mm-hmm. 
 Cool. 
 Cool.

 Ofe : Fun. 
 Not at Bird's party, but still having fun. 
 You know, if I had a girlfriend living at my house, I wouldn't act like it's no biggie. 
 How do you know? 
 You have to have a girlfriend first. 
 I got plenty of girlfriends. 
 I got ladies all over this town. 
 I do, I have so many ladies. 
 Truth? 
 Yeah, of course. 
 It's not really that great. 
 Why? 
 Max just seems... 
 I don't know, different. 
 Well, the bullet did miss his heart by a hair. 
 Yeah, well... 
 That doesn't really address the other stuff. 
 Like, tonight is a perfect example. 
 I'm here studying and he's at a party getting high. 
 'Cause that's what Max does. 
 Yeah, but... 
 Look, I've got one parent who's a jock and one who's a total braniac, but they're good together. 
 You don't have to be the same to be in love. 
 It just feels like things between us are different. 
 Everything is different. 
 Well. But you know what? 
 I'd like to talk more about me again, if we could get back to that, because... 
 Oh, more... yeah. 
 I think I like that a little bit better. 
 Yeah.

 That's gonna make me sick. 
 Do you think I should forgive him? 
 It's up to you. 
 All I know is that if I keep hating him, then he'll win. 
 He'll have taken all my power and left me a victim. 
 And I'm not a victim. 
 So you lost your temper. 
 You were upset. 
 If I'd been there, I would have gone crazy, too. 
 I don't know what to do. 
 You know, I love him, but I... 
 I can't handle what's happening. 
 I just need... 
 I need things to go back to normal. 
 Why can't everyone just... Stay themselves? 
 When you feel better, maybe the two of you should just talk about where you are, you know? 
 You're in different places right now, but maybe you'll be back in a groove soon. 
 I hope so. 
 I love Max. 
 I think you're good together. 
 Thanks. 
 It's okay. 
 It's me. 
 Hey. 
 Hey. 
 I just want to say, I should have told you that Crash was out of jail. 
 I was wrong. 
 I apologize. 
 Thanks. 
 I just wish I'd have known he was out. 
 Yeah. 
 There's a lot of things that I should have told you. 
 You know when you were kidnapped, the worst thing about it was just not knowing what happened to you. 
 Were you injured, were you... 
 But even if it was the worst news in the world, all I wanted to know was the truth. 
 The truth. 
 ♪ Who's with us now ♪ 
 I'm sorry I yelled at you. 
 Me too. 
 And I'm really sorry for upsetting you and for not checking in with you about the whole Crash thing. 
 I could have done that. 
 No, no. 
 I should have done that. 
 You don't have to check in with me. 
 It just feels like, I don't know, we're in two different places or something. 
 I know. 
 I thought I was a forgiving person and this whole Crash thing is just... 
 Yeah, we can talk about that. 
 I don't want to talk about it. 
 Taylor, we are different. 
 ♪♪ 
 That's what makes us great. 
 Maybe. 
 But maybe not. 
 I... 
 I don't know. 
 I think it'd probably be good if... 
 If we broke up for a while. 
 Right? 
 I guess if... 
 I really love you, Max. 
 But you need to do your thing and I need to do mine. 
 Taylor. 
 No, I just... 
 I just wanted you to know how I was feeling. 
 Good night. 
 Everything okay? 
 No. 
 Everything is not okay. 
 I can't tell Elizabeth about Lori, Carter, I already told you why. 
 Okay, but... 
 You are not giving her a chance and you're not giving yourself a chance to get past this. 
 Dad, this is the lie that is going to destroy us. 
 Not my abduction, not the egg donor stuff, this one. 
 You can't just bury something like this. 
 If you tell her now, she might forgive you. 
 She won't. 
 How do you know that? 
 Because I can't forgive myself. 
 It's unforgivable. 
 (Sniffling) 
 Dad, what happened? 
 Tell me the whole story. 
 Lori : I was having an affair with David Wilson when Carter and Taylor were a year old. 
 What is your relationship with Elizabeth Wilson? 
 Didn't have one. 
 I only knew what David told me during the affair. 
 Which was? 
 He was unhappy. 
 He wished he'd never married her. 
 She destroyed his self esteem. 
 Made his life miserable. 
 How did you meet the Wilsons? 
 I met David in the park. 
 I don't know where she was. 
 He was always the one with the girls. 
 Hi, looks like you could use an extra hand. 
 Yes, actually. If you could... 
 Ooh. 
 Oh, she's gorgeous. 
 They both are. 
 (David) When I asked her if she lived near us, she said she was a hospice worker down the road. 
 Was that true? 
 To be honest, I have no idea. 
 (Lori) He was miserable. 
 That's pretty much all we talked about at first. But I knew right away, he needed someone to love him. I should have known something was wrong. She was very needy and I was vulnerable. Because you weren't getting along with mom. We were disconnected. On Elizabeth's birthday, they got into a big fight. We were supposed to have a weekend away, but your mom and I had a huge fight. She couldn't bear the thought of being alone with him and went to her parents' house. I called. I tried to talk to her, but Joan answered and said your mom needed space. Is that when you got together with Lori? So he called me and said we should meet. He called you. I went to the local bar and there she was. Waiting for you? I don't know. I wouldn't put it past her. The bar, he just unloaded. I mean, the guy was so unhappy. He just went on and on about what a bitch his wife was. I was unhappy about not getting along with your mother. We were awful to each other. It sounds horrible. Lori : It seemed pretty obvious after that night that everything would just fall into place. Me, him, the girls. So are you claiming that you had planned, at this time, to kidnap one of these children? God, no. The plan was for him to leave her and bring the girls. I thought that was the last I'd ever see her. Did you think she was planning on taking me then? She never even mentioned you or Taylor except to say you were beautiful, which you were, but you have to remember, this was two years before you were taken. We had moved on. Dad. You have to tell mom. You just do. I can't. Too much has happened. Every second this lie goes on, Lori is winning. She is getting exactly what she wants. But maybe if this is all out in the open, maybe all of us could start to... (Sighing) To get on with our lives. What if your mother can't forgive me? What if she can? ♪ Now put on your paint ♪ 
♪ No turning back... ♪ You thought he was gonna leave his wife? I know he was. He promised. ♪ Everybody wants to be king ♪ 
♪ To hold out their hand for a kiss on the ring ♪ 
♪ But we're not all cut from the same cloth ♪ 
♪ Count the scars on our faces from the battles we've lost ♪ 
♪ And everybody wants to be king ♪ 
♪ High on the throne full of power of pain ♪ 
♪ You can live like an angel ♪

♪ The tears run hard ♪ 
♪ So put on your paint ♪ I'm responsible for Carter's kidnapping. With their dad's affair with Lori uncovered. Your father and I are separating. Is the entire family now at war? I take after dad, you take after the not job who is in prison. Stop it. I don't want you in my life.
