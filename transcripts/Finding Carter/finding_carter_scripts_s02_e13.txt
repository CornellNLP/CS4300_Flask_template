 Previously on Finding Carter... 
 Stop! 
 You didn't belong with those people. 
 You belong with me. 
 You are a sick, delusional felon. 
 Kyle! 
 Grant : Now that he's gone, you're finally ready to be my mom? 
 We had a really great thing going. 
 Don't give up on me, okay? 
 I'm learning how to forgive. 
 Surprise. 
 Crash! 
 I'm so happy to see you. 
 Crash : Next I'll find out where I'm posted. 
 What if you get stationed on the other side of the world? 
 We'll deal with that when it happens. 
 Lori's going on trial. 
 She could be released immediately. 
 lawyer : What did you say to her, the defendant, in the hospital when she was ill? 
 I love you. 
 Tell me you love me more. 
 Was this woman, in fact, your mother or not? 
 Maybe. (sniffles) 
 I call to the stand Benjamin Wallace. 
 Who is he? 
 Liz : They added him, at the last minute. 
 Lori Stevens is my biological mother. 
 My biological father is David Wilson.

 female reporter : In a stunning turn of events in the case of Stevens vs. the Commonwealth of Virginia, defendant Lori Stevens has been found not guilty of federal kidnapping charges. 
 Stevens has been released after time served. 
 Federal child custody has been dropped by the defendant, Carter Wilson. 
 She will remain in the care of the Wilson family. 
 Liz : Carter! 
 I don't know what my plans are. 
 I'm just grateful to have my freedom and to know that my son is alive and well, and that the judge saw fit to award me custody. 
 And that's all Ms. Stevens has to say right now. 
 Thank you very much. 
 (reporters clamoring) 
 Thank you very much.

 No Snapchat, no Twitter. _ 
 This doesn't make any sense. 
 How could Ben be nowhere on the Internet? 
 Seems pretty obvious. 
 What? 
 He doesn't want to be found. 
 When you came back, you weren't exactly open to the idea. 
 Come on, that was different. 
 Yeah, people had been looking for you. 
 Lori! What the hell are you doing here! 
 I had to come to... 
 Do I have to call the police? 
 Because if that's what it's gonna take to keep you away from us... 
 Ben : Uh, the lady with the mole and the mustache needs your autograph. 
 Tension. Got it. 
 We've been looking for you. 
 And, here I am. 
 Oka... I asked you what you were doing here. 
 We're living here. 
 This is our district. 
 You moved here? 
 Hey, uh, we should do this. 
 They can't give me my classes until you sign. 
 Look, Carter, you don't need to worry about me interfering in your life. 
 I understand how you feel about me, and I'm gonna stay away. 
 But I just want you to know that I love you, and I will always be here for you if you ever need anything. 
 Don't worry, I won't. 
 Do you think we need to get a restraining order? 
 That's not a bad idea, actually. 
 Liz, she has my son. 
 I know, David. 
 I'm trying really hard to be okay with that. 
 She did promise she was gonna stay away, if that's worth anything. 
 How about, nothing? 
 Less than nothing. 
 Liz : Okay, what are we gonna do? 
 I don't know. 
 I'm just... I'm trying to take it all in. 
 Well, I know one thing... 
 I don't want her near my family. 
 Neither do I, obviously, but we have to handle it the right way. 
 But she's already shown up at the girls' school. 
 The... the woman, she doesn't understand the word, "boundaries." 
 We need to get the authorities involved. 
 Liz, I just don't want to provoke her. 
 (indistinct hallway chatter) 
 Hey. 
 Hi. 
 Um... 
 Can I help you with something? 
 I wanted to ask if you are doing okay? 
 Yeah, I'm fine. 
 What's the deal with this place? 
 Principal seems like kind of a bitch. 
 Yeah, kind of. To tell you the truth, I don't really spend that much time here myself. 
 Yeah? 
 I've kind of had a couple things to deal with recently. 
 Yeah, cool. 
 Hey! 
 If you need a place to stay or something... 
 I have one. 
 Okay, yeah, but it's... it's not your only option. 
 I don't think you know what you're getting into living with Lori. 
 Yeah, actually, I do. 
 She knows the score. She's gonna live her life, I'm gonna live mine. 
 Obviously, you don't know her. 
 You don't know me. 
 Look, I'm just trying to stay out of the system. 
 And all of this between you guys, it's your drama, it's not mine. 
 Okay, fine. I get it. 
 The whole thing must seem... pretty messed up. 
 It's no biggie. 
 Look, I just want you to know... if you need anything, ever... I'm around. 
 Don't worry. I won't.

 Why are you taking shop? 
 Easy "A." Gets the GPA up. 
 Speaking of which, I have some... not so great news. 
 What news? 
 You've been dethroned.

 Mid-term grades are out. 
 You're looking at the new number one ranked student in our class.

 Kind of. How's it going? 
 Well, uh, our world may be expanding or contracting, and the guy who drafted the Declaration of Independence was also a slave owner.

 Okay. 
 Hey. 
 Hey. 
 So, I thought of something I need. 
 What's that? 
 A ride. 
 Okay. 
 (clears throat) So, uh... 
 Where were you? 
 I mean, before all of this. 
 Look, I appreciate the ride, but I'm really not that much of a talker. 
 You seemed like a talker on my way outside the courtroom. 
 Yeah, well... You're, uh, I get it. You are good with strangers, not so good with sisters. 
 Right. 
 I just wanted to know something about you. 
 Like, I don't know, where you come from. 
 I get it, you want to know all about my shady past. 
 (chuckles) No, just... where you were before this. 
 Crappy town in Delaware. 
 Okay. And, before that? 
 Crappy town in New Jersey. 
 Does foster care really suck as much as they say it does? 
 No. My first family was pretty cool, actually. 
 I don't really remember a lot because I was locked in the basement most of the time, but... 
 What? (chuckles) 
 That was really not... That's not funny. 
 What? I thought that's what you wanted to hear. 
 Stuff like that really happen to you? 
 No, I had five families in 13 years. 
 All fine, and then I lived in a group home, that's it. 
 So, they were all nice? 
 Nope. But, no beatings or basements. 
 Actually, just pull over right here, and I'll hop out for a few minutes.

 I got Ben's address from the school. 
 Did you, uh... 
 Did you know he was mine? 
 Of course. 
 Why didn't you tell me? 
 You ended things with us, went back to your wife. 
 You had him. 
 Why did you take Carter? 
 I didn't have him. 
 What? What do you mean? Where was he? 
 (sighs) 
 They took him away. 
 I was... 
 I was mentally ill, and... I lost him. 
 Even with the baby, I... 
 I had no one. 
 I want to know him. 
 That's between you and him. 
 I'm just trying to take care of him. 
 How are you gonna do that? 
 You don't have to worry. I have a plan. 
 You did what? 
 I wanted her to know I want to see him. 
 You know what you've done, right? 
 I've been honest with her. 
 You did exactly what she was waiting for you to do. 
 You went to her. God only knows what she's gonna do now. 
 She's not gonna do anything. 
 Yeah, 'cause that's her M.O. 
 I have no choice, Liz. 
 I want to know my son. 
 As far as I can tell, she's open to it, so I'm gonna take her at her word.

 I'm just trying to take care of my kid. 
 Oh. At the expense of someone you also claim is your kid? 
 She is my kid. 
 I think the courts established that. 
 Lori, you have no authority to write a book about Carter, or about any of us. 
 Actually, I do. 
 Not that it's any of your business. 
 It is my business because Carter, she's my daughter, and it affects her. 
 Just one of the many lessons of motherhood that you never learned. 
 I'm not gonna stand here and argue about my credentials with you. 
 Fine. Fine. 
 I just... I just need to remind you that... 
 Carter, she already despises you. 
 So, if you write this book, any chance you ever had of having any kind of relationship with her is over. 
 You can count on that.

 Have you been here before? 
 Ah, no. First time. I used to hang out in these *** 
 But it's kind of dead now. 
 Too many hipsters. 
 Freakin' lumberjack beards. 
 Ugh, yeah. The worst. 
 Yeah. 
 Here you go. Have fun. 
 Thanks.

 (chanting) Taylor! Taylor! Taylor! Taylor!

 Gabe : Nice. 
 Take the time down to 30 seconds. 
 Fill your cups. 
 (coughs) 
 Damon, are you good? We can stop. 
 No way! You're on the cusp of greatness here. 
 Num... ber... one. 
 Come on, dude. She's winning, let's go. 
 I'm good. 
 You don't look really good. 
 Yeah, Gabe, get him a glass of water. 
 Taylor, stop being a buzzkill. 
 Stop being an out of control ass, drinking too much and pissing away your money. 
 You're drunk yourself. You've been drinking all night. 
 Max : You know, I think both of you are probably a little inebriated, so... 
 At least I know when to stop. 
 What I do with my money is none of your business. 
 (thudding to floor) 
 Are you happy now? 
 Another drink? 
 Oh, no, thanks. 
 I can't, it's a school night. 
 Oh, where do you go? 
 Um... uh, Reston Community College. 
 Why, is that where you go? 
 Me? No. 
 When I was 16, I got up and walked out, and never looked back. 
 Do you regret it? 
 No. 
 Not at all. 
 You know, once I left my life got started. 
 Did some traveling and started working here. 
 Sounds cool. 
 All you gotta do is choose it. 
 Jerry, I need two mojitos. 
 Yup. 
 I think I'm getting you in trouble. 
 You can't. I run the place. 
 But one of our servers quit, so I am stuck doing double duty until I find someone to replace her. 
 Hey. 
 Are you okay? 
 Yeah. 
 What are you doing? 
 Texting. 
 What's she doing? 
 (sighs) Not very much. 
 Texting Ofe? 
 He's bummed he's not at my party. 
 It's good that he's not at your party. 
 I miss him. 
 Me, too. 
 But, uh, rehab's the best place for him right now. 
 I'm sorry I yelled at you. 
 (sighs) No, I started it. 
 You're right, you did. 
 But you're also right. 
 I'm not doing so great. 
 Gabe, I... 
 I hate seeing you like this. 
 What can I do? 
 I don't know. 
 But, I like that you're worried about me. 
 I am so happy to be in bed. 
 The sooner this day is over, the better. 
 My publisher called today, again. 
 Lori backed out. 
 She's not writing the book. 
 Wonder what made her change her mind. 
 (softly) I met him. 
 Carter brought him over. 
 Did you talk to him? 
 A little. 
 And? 
 He has my eyes. 
 (chuckles) 
 Well, it's a lot to take in. 
 Are you doing okay? 
 Of all the horrible, sick things Lori has done, bringing that kid into the world is not one of them. 
 I want to do what I can for him. 
 I don't want to lose him. 
 Hey. 
 Thanks for meeting me. 
 Good morning.
