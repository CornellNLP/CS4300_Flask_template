 Carter : Previously on "Finding Carter"... 
 Dad, I feel like you're not telling me something. 
 I had a one-night stand. 
 It was the biggest mistake of my life. 
 Carter, this is Hillary. 
 Hi. 
 I'm your dad's teaching assistant. 
 Taylor : Max and I are done. 
 Your father and I are separating. 
 ♪♪ 
 Hey. 
 Gabe, is... 
 Is that Carter? 
 I think so. 
 Wait, you still go to school here? 
 Funny. 
 You guys should do standup. 
 We heard about what happened with Lori and we were just trying to cheer you up. 
 You okay? 
 I'm not gonna lie, it's been a rough few days. 
 In fact, the only reason I'm here is because the new guidance counselor has insisted that I come in for some face-to-face time with my parents. 
 Have you guys met this woman? 
 Abby. 
 She's a serious hard-ass. 
 But her ass is seriously hard. 
 Well played, it is. Great. 
 Yeah. 
 Well, I'll see you later. 
 Yeah. 
 See ya. 
 Bye. 
 Hey, where have you been? You're late. 
 By, like, three minutes. 
 Do we know what this meeting is about? 
 Something about my future. 
 That sounds positive. 
 Elizabeth? 
 Yes. 
 Abby, this is my husband David. 
 Hello. And you must be Carter. 
 I must be. 
 Shall we get started? 
 Yes. 
 Okay. 
 Abby : According to our records, 
 Carter's missed nine days of school this month, ten last month. 
 Ten days? 
 We had no idea. 
 Abby : On top of that, her GPA has been sliding each quarter. 
 It's now a 2.4. 
 Elizabeth : 2.4? 
 If Carter keeps this up she may have to repeat her junior year or she could be kicked out for chronic truancy. 
 Carter : Okay. 
 Yes, I fully admit that school hasn't been the biggest priority for me recently, but that could have something to do with the fact that I just committed the woman who raised me to a mental institution. 
 I just returned home after being kidnapped for the second time in my 17 years on this planet, so how about you all just give me a little bit of a break? 
 Sweetheart, you've been through a lot, we get that. 
 But school is important. 
 What can we do to help you? 
 I don't need help, really, I'm fine. 
 You've had a rough time, but maybe if you think about letting it stop, try to look forward. 
 Abby : We all want to help you succeed. Now, are you planning on taking your college aptitude test tomorrow? 
 Was it something I put down in my calendar? No. 
 These scores are vital to your future. 
 The higher your score, the more opportunities you'll have for college. 
 The sooner you take them, the more chances you'll have to increase your score. 
 Well, I want to thank you all for your time and your concern. 
 Consider your message received. 
 Loud and clear.

 So you just left? 
 Yeah. 
 All three of them were just standing there going through my file like I was on trial or something. 
 Now they are insisting that I take the SATs tomorrow. 
 Those monsters. 
 Whose side are you on, Crash? 
 Come on, they're just looking out for you. 
 Yeah, okay, but I really don't need them to. 
 You know, okay, for all of Lori's faults, and believe me, there are many, she never got on my case about school. 
 She just trusted me enough to leave me alone and let me figure stuff out for myself. 
 Miss. 
 This employee bothering you? 
 Oh, no. I was just, um, talking... 
 What? 
 He's kidding. 
 This is my uncle Shane. 
 Oh. 
 It's nice to finally meet you. 
 I'm Carter. 
 Nice to meet you, too. 
 Thank you for everything you did for Crash. 
 Hey. 
 Crash is family. 
 Never turn your back on family. 
 And don't forget, we need this turnaround by 2:00. 
 Yeah, I got it, I got it. 
 See you again soon, I hope. 
 Yeah, definitely. Bye. 
 See? Why can't any of the adults in my family be that cool? 
 I think I have a way to turn your day around. 
 How? 
 I'm gonna take you out tonight. 
 What, on, like, a date? 
 Yes, an actual date in a nice restaurant with tablecloths and waiters, menus that don't have pictures of food on them. 
 You don't have to do that. 
 I want to. 
 Okay. 
 So. 
 How'd you discover this room? 
 I was a library monitor last year, so I know every nook and cranny of this place. 
 No one ever set foot in the Russian literature section, not once. 
 Well, this was fun. 
 Should we do something again after lunch? 
 You know, we've hooked up five times this week, and each time you take off the second it's over. 
 What's the rush? 
 Well, at this moment, I have exactly four minutes to get to pre-Calc and I thought that this was just a... 
 Friends with benefits type thing situation. 
 Doesn't have to be. 
 Why don't you come to the fair with me tonight? 
 Misterwives is playing. 
 I don't know. SATs are tomorrow. 
 I was just gonna go home and do some last-minute cramming. 
 You've been cramming for months. 
 You're ready. 
 Let me present this to you in a way you can better understand. 
 Do you want to go to the fair with me? 
 "A," not at all, 
 "B," not sure, 
 "C," a little, 
 "D," a lot. 
 Um... 
 "C"? 
 "C." 
 I can work with that. 
 Okay, looks like your half of the bills comes to 537.12. 
 Really? 
 Well, I think I'm gonna be a little short this month. 
 Short as in, like, can you spot me a fiver, or... 
 Or a couple C-notes. 
 Oh. 
 Sorry. 
 I wasn't anticipating my grandma being so rigid with the monthly allowance. 
 She's trying to get me to come and live with her and she thinks the big squeeze will do it. 
 Can you just cover me and I'll pay you back? 
 Bird, you know I'd be up for that totally. 
 You've been really great about letting me stay here. 
 I just... truth is, I just... 
 I don't make enough to cover us both. 
 Money management. 
 It's never really been my strong suit. 
 No worries, you have other stellar qualities. 
 But if we're gonna keep the lights on around here, you're gonna maybe need to cut back on entertaining. 
 Yeah, I guess. 
 Except the people have grown to expect certain amenities from me. 
 What am I supposed to do? Go all Marie Antoinette on them? 
 No, no, nobody's asking you to lose your head. 
 I'm just asking you to keep it on straight.

♪ If I bit off a little bit... ♪ 
 Hey, do you have any lip gloss? 
 Whoa! Hot date? 
 Lukewarm. 
 Uh, yeah, it's in the top drawer. 
 So? 
 Who's the lucky guy? 
 Ofe. 
 Ofe? 
 Wow, I did not see that coming. 
 Me neither. 
 I kinda like it, though. 
 Yeah, I think I kinda like it, too. 
 What's all this? 
 Oh. 
 I also have a date tonight. 
 Cool. Anyone I know? 
 Wow. 
 Taylor, he's not the same guy anymore. 
 To me, he is. 
 Okay. 
 You should go with that one. 
 Brings out your eyes.

 (Drawer closes) 
 What is this? 
 Can you please just forget you saw that? 
 No, I don't think I can. 
 Where did you get this? 
 Lori gave it to me. 
 Why does she have a picture of our dad? 
 To prove that she had an affair with him. 
 That woman is so crazy. 
 Does she really expect us to believe that... 
 Well, it isn't true, is it? 
 This is why mom and dad are separating? 
 Tay, I think it's better if you ask them these questions. 
 No, I'm asking you. 
 Yeah, and I'm saying, I think it's better if you ask them. 
 Fine, I will. 
 Is it true? 
 Where'd you get that? 
 She found it in my room. 
 Is what true? 
 Did you have an affair with Lori? 
 Did he what? 
 Taylor, this is not the time. 
 It's a yes or no question, dad. 
 This is an adult conversation that I'm not open to having right now. 
 Why not? 
 Because not everything your mother and I deal with in our personal lives is your business. 
 How is you sleeping with Carter's kidnapper not my business? 
 Taylor, that's enough. 
 This conversation is over. 
 Anything you'd like to say? 
 It's true. 
 I knew it. 
 It happened a long time ago. 
 It was a couple of years before Carter was kidnapped. 
 I am so sorry, Taylor, we should have told you. 
 You thought that Carter could handle it but we couldn't? 
 They didn't tell me. I found out by myself. 
 Like that somehow makes it better? 
 We're sisters. You should have told me. 
 Yeah, it would have been nice if you told me, too. 
 I promised them I wouldn't. 
 Oh, 'cause that would be, what, the first time you broke a promise to our parents? 
 Taylor, we were just trying to protect you. 
 Well, I don't know who to be more mad at, you guys or Lori, who somehow still manages to screw up my life, even from jail. 
 I'm out of here. 
 Where are you going? 
 The fair. Don't wait up. 
 Taylor. 
 Can I come, too? 
 Sure. Why not? 
 Enjoy your date. 
 Study date with Bird. For the SATs tomorrow.

 We agreed we wouldn't say anything.

 So why'd you do it? 
 Because I hated seeing Taylor so upset. 
 Or because you couldn't pass up an opportunity to make me look like a bad guy. 
 David, they got past my affair with Kyle, they'll get past this, too. 
 Are you trying to turn the kids against me? 
 Is that what this is about? 
 What are you talking about? 
 Why would I do that? 
 Because we don't know where we'll stand when the dust settles on this separation. 
 For all I know, you're... You're plotting. 
 Plotting? 
 Yeah, trying to get the kids to pick sides, in case in the end, you know. 
 David, I am still pulling to make this marriage work. 
 And you find that funny? 
 Hilarious, actually. 
 Why? 
 Because from where I'm standing, only one of us is pulling for this marriage to work and it's me. 
 (Doorbell ringing) 
 Hi. 
 Is David in? 
 Maybe your date would like to weigh in on this. 
 I'm sorry, are we seeing other people now? 
 Hillary and I are just friends, we are not seeing each other, unlike you and Kyle. 
 What are you talking about now? 
 Grant told me he saw the two of you kissing. 
 That's not true. 
 So Grant's lying? 
 No, what happened was, Kyle tried to kiss me - and I stopped it. 
 If you want to see other people, just say so. 
 I'm not the one with the date in the next room. 
 We are going for a friendly drink. It's not a date. 
 Well, if you want it to be, please don't let me stop you. 
 Oh, so you do think we should see other people. 
 No, what I think is you're afraid to tell me that you want to see other people. 
 Excuse me, I'm so sorry, I couldn't help but overhear. 
 I think I'm just gonna go. 
 No, please... 
 I'm sorry, could you hang on a second? 
 Well, it sounds like you two are having difficulty communicating. 
 How can you tell? 
 I was a psychology minor. 
 Maybe seeing other people isn't the worst idea. 
 Well, now we're communicating. 
 So, yeah. 
 Business is going really well, Shane's already looking to expand, open up a few more shops. 
 He's teaching me how the whole operation works. 
 In a few years, I should be able to move up from mechanic to manager. 
 Wow. 
 I never heard you sound, so, um... 
 Mature. Nice. 
 Mature may be a stretch, but for the first time in my life, I feel like I... 
 I'm gonna be okay. 
 I'm not gonna screw everything up, you know? 
 What about you? 
 You feeling any better? 
 Not really a bit. 
 Well, don't worry. Dinner is just phase one. 
 I got a whole phase two planned out. 
 What's phase two? 
 It's a surprise. 
 Okay, I don't mean to offend, but the last thing I need in my life right now is another surprise. 
 Can you just tell me? 
 Okay. 
 We're going to the County Fair. 
 You want to go to a County Fair? 
 What? I can appreciate a good fair. 
 I'm shocked you would want to participate in such a wholesome G-rated activity. 
 But who said it had to be G-rated?

 Yes (Chuckling). 
 I'll just stay here, while you guys talk. 
 Hey. 
 Tay, you've barely said a word to me all evening. 
 Why start now? 
 All right. 
 Just so I'm clear, our parents are getting separated for something that happened, like, 15 years ago. 
 Yeah, it doesn't make a whole lot of sense to me, either. 
 Nothing in this family ever does.

 Yeah, that's what I said. 
 Everyone feeling ready for tomorrow? 
 Ready-ish. 
 Abby, what's your professional opinion on guessing versus skipping questions you don't know the answers to? 
 I hear that it's actually better to skip. 
 I hear you're better off guessing. 
 Ofe : If you're gonna guess, the correct answer is almost never the letter "D." 
 Gabe : What about the essays? 'Cause I hear that short essays actually score higher than long essays. 
 Abby : Don't get caught up in all that. 
 There's no secret formula for beating the test. 
 Just... do your best. 
 Bird : Well, as long as I get a high enough score to get into a good art school, I'll be happy. 
 Well, I need to kick ass if I'm gonna have a shot at an athletic scholarship. 
 Okay, you know what? 
 We're uh... We're gonna get some food. 
 Sorry. 
 Just needed to get away from that conversation. 
 And that woman. 
 Who was she? 
 That was Abby. 
 The new guidance counselor I was telling you about. 
 She doesn't seem so bad. 
 She's got everybody brainwashed about the SATs tomorrow. 
 Oh, did you decide whether or not you're taking them? 
 No, mom, I didn't. 
 Just asking. 
 Okay, well, I'm just trying to enjoy tonight and not worry about tomorrow. 
 Gee, if only you were able to talk to someone who could look into the future and tell you what was gonna happen. 
 We are not doing that. 
 Oh, we are so doing that. 
 Let's go. 
 Let's do it. 
 (Loud crowd chatter) 
 Grant? 
 I thought that was you. 
 Reagan. 
 Hey. Uh... 
 Funny running in... to you here. 
 I know, right? 
 I can't believe we're finally meeting in person. 
 Talking face to face. 
 Instead of on Skype. 
 It was bound to happen eventually. 
 So... 
 What's up, girlfriend? 
 Since we skyped this afternoon? 
 Not much. 
 Cool. 
 Hey. How about instead of talking, we just go to separate corners and, uh... facetime each other? 
 Yeah, it'll be like old times. 
 So, having fun? 
 Yeah, you? 
 Interesting. 
 Very, very interesting. 
 Seriously? 
 Just go with it. 
 You have a sister? 
 Yeah. 
 And two brothers, right? 
 Nope. Just one. 
 Close, though. 
 So everything that I'm seeing here for you is really good. 
 This is the king of wands card. 
 It says you're career-driven and goal-oriented. 
 The page of pentacles says you're a good student with a commitment to learning. 
 The queen of wands says you'll achieve happiness and success in all aspects of your career. 
 God. 
 Okay, I can't read your energy unless you're fully open to this experience. 
 I'm sorry, but, are you kidding? 
 Carter... 
 What? 
 Come on, she probably gives the same reading to everyone who comes in here. 
 No, I... 
 Here's a question. 
 How come everything you hear from a tarot reader is a good thing? 
 Is all the energy off of  every  single person who comes in here positive or do you ever, like, have to give the bad news? 
 You know, like this card says you're not gonna graduate college and this card says you're destined to end up working a crappy minimum wage job for the rest of your life and this card says you're gonna get 740 on your SATs tomorrow, so why even bother taking them? 
 Sorry. 
 You didn't even let her finish. 
 Yeah, I'd heard enough. 
 Hey. 
 Come on. 
 Why are you taking this so seriously? 
 It's supposed to be fun. 
 Yeah, really fun that everyone in my life except me has a plan, including you. 
 I wish I could go five minutes without being reminded of it. 
 Okay. 
 Statistically, between the two of us, one of these should have landed already. 
 This game is rigged. 
 You sure you're okay? 
 Yeah. I told you, I'm fine. 
 Why? 
 I don't know. 
 It just seems like something's on your mind. 
 Just... 
 Stupid family stuff. 
 You know how it is. 
 Actually, I don't. 
 I grew up in a totally normal home, with two dads who love each other. 
 No kidnappings, no lies, no drama. 
 My family has no stuff, but I'd love to be the guy you can talk to about yours. 
 I don't want to talk. 
 I want to win.

 Yeah, I do. 
 I'm serious. 
 There's a real connection there. 
 Okay, even I won't go down the teacher route. 
 It only leads to trouble. 
 All I ever do is study and go to practice. 
 Maybe I could use a little trouble. 
 Girl : You're the best, Bird. 
 Boy : You rock, Bird. 
 Boy 2 : Thanks, Bird. 
 No need. It's my pleasure. 
 Do I even want to ask? 
 Relax, okay, I just bought out the bumper cars for the next hour. 
 Bird, where did you get the money for that? 
 I squeezed a little extra out of my grandparents. 
 Okay, okay, but what about our bills? 
 We need that money to eat and live. 
 We're gonna be on the street. 
 Oh, my God, it only cost a few hundred bucks. 
 Why do you have to be so dramatic? 
 Why do you have to think that you won't have any friends unless you buy them? 
 Whoa, check this one out. 
 Nice. 
 Tell me.

 Reagan, where'd you go? 
 Reagan? 
 (Indistinct chatter) 
 I was like, might want to adjust that. 
 Wow, that's really embarrassing. 
 Hey, Abby. 
 Hey, Carter. 
 Look, could you just do me a favor and stay away from the guy I'm seeing? 
 When you talk trash to my parents about me is humiliating enough. 
 Uh... 
 No, she wasn't doing that, Carter. 
 I started up a conversation with her. 
 Why? 
 He was just telling me how great he thinks you are. 
 And even though you may not have it all figured out, you're the smartest person he knows and I shouldn't worry about you. 
 Did I miss anything? 
 No, that's... 
 That's pretty much it. 
 (Phone ringing) All right. 
 It's Shane, I gotta take this. 
 Sorry. 
 That's okay. 
 Getting yelled at by students is pretty much a daily occurrence. 
 I'm used to it. 
 So, I saw one of my test prep books in the garbage outside of my office. 
 I'm not gonna be seeing you tomorrow, am I? 
 I wouldn't hold your breath. 
 You know, if Crash was able to let go of his past, and turn his life around, especially with everything he's been through, it seems like you could, too.

 Hey. 
 Where'd you go? 
 Where did I go? 
 Where did you go? 
 Sorry. I kept walking, I thought you were right behind me. 
 Well, I wasn't. 
 Maybe you should pay closer attention next time. 
 Okay, well. 
 I should probably be getting back to my family. 
 Good seeing you. 
 Yeah. 
 (Laughter, cheering) 
 Hey. 
 Hey. 
 You having fun? 
 Yeah, you? 
 Yeah, a blast. 
 Something's bothering you, I can tell. 
 It's funny, I can tell there's something bothering you, too. 
 Maybe we're psychically connected. 
 Maybe. 
 What number am I thinking of? 
 17. 
 46. 
 Damn it. 
 Oh, well. 
 We tried. 
 You want to talk about whatever it is? 
 No, I'll be fine. 
 Tell me what's going on with you. 
 Well. 
 My dad had an affair with Lori. 
 Whoa. 
 Yeah. 
 A few years before she took Carter. 
 That's why my parents are separating. 
 So that's what's going on with me. 
 Are you okay? 
 Well, at first I was mad at everyone for keeping me in the dark about it, but truthfully, I'm glad that they did, because now that I know, I wish that I didn't. 
 I think that in the back of my mind, I was holding on to some stupid fantasy that my parents might actually end up back together. 
 Now it just seems hopeless. 
 I have to disagree. 
 Why? 
 I mean, they've already been through so much together. I'm sure they can get through this, too. 
 I don't know. 
 This is pretty bad. 
 Have a little faith. 
 Thanks. 
 You're still the only person I can talk to about any of this. 
 I'm glad to be of service. 
 (Crash) Oh, hey. 
 Max, I need a favor. 
 Shane just called. 
 He's got a job he wants me to do tonight, but I... 
 I really don't want to bail on Carter. 
 Is there any chance you could do it? 
 It's easy money. 
 It pays 200 bucks. 
 Yeah. 
 Yeah, dude, I can definitely use 200 bucks. 
 Dude, you're a lifesaver. 
 Come on, I'll give you the details. 
 All right.

 What changed? 
 David and I decided to see other people during our separation. 
 And whose idea was that? 
 Does it matter? 
 A little. 
 Kyle, the truth is, I don't know why I'm doing anything right now. 
 I'm just trying to make it through the day. 
 I get that. 
 But... 
 I know I wanted to see you and I'm glad you're here. 
 (Vehicle approaching) 
 Carter's here. 
 I thought you had the place to yourself. 
 Yeah, so did I. 
 Oh, okay! 
 So I'm guessing the kids don't know about your new arrangement with David yet. 
 No, and I want to keep it that way, so I'll call you. 
 Okay. 
 Hey, how was your study session? 
 Fine. 
 Carter. Freeze. 
 What? 
 Have you been drinking? 
 A little, yeah. 
 How do you expect to remember anything tonight? 
 I wasn't studying. 
 Okay. 
 Where were you? 
 I was with Crash. 
 Please tell me you're joking. 
 Nope, not joking. 
 Why would you let him back in your life? 
 Oh, you mean the guy Abby thinks so highly of? 
 Yeah, we ran into your buddy at the County Fair, and guess what? 
 She loves Crash. 
 Thinks he's a really great guy. 
 In fact, she told me she thinks I should be more like him. 
 I don't understand. 
 Why are you determined to blow your entire future? 
 What future? 
 Don't you get it? 
 College was never in the plan for me. 
 Lori never even mentioned it. 
 But now I'm supposed to take this test tomorrow, this really important test, so that I can get some score, some number, which will essentially determine what the rest of my entire life looks like, and that's... 
 You know, that's great if you have absolutely any idea what the hell you want the rest of your life to look like, but I just don't, and I can't take it. 
 I'm not exactly sure what I'm supposed to say right now to you I never had this conversation with Grant or Taylor. 
 I feel like if I push too hard, you're just gonna push back and I'm afraid if I don't push hard enough, then... 
 I'm Lori. 
 (Exhaling) 
 You're a lot of things, but you're not Lori. 
 I just wish that you wouldn't put so much pressure on yourself. 
 You don't have to figure out your entire life at age 17, baby. 
 Why don't you just take the test tomorrow, see what happens and you have nothing to lose. 
 Because I'll bomb it. 
 Okay, so you know what? 
 Bomb it. 
 Bomb it big, okay? 
 And then you take it again. 
 I'll help you and Taylor will help you. 
 Your whole family is behind you. 
 You don't have to go through this alone. 
 You probably just want me to go to college so you can have me out of the house for four years. 
 Well, that's definitely a perk. 
 Thank you. 
 (Computer ringing) 
 (Beeps) 
 Hillary : I am telling you, that guy Dean falls asleep in every one of your classes. 
 Come on, every class? 
 15 minutes in. Like clockwork. 
 How have I not noticed this? 
 Well, he made sure to sit behind the largest person he can find and then he pulls his cap down... 
 Oh, and here I was thinking I was becoming a pretty good teacher. 
 You are a good teacher. 
 You're a great teacher. 
 Well, you're a great teaching assistant. 
 I shouldn't have done that. 
 Why not? I've been wanting you to all night. 
 I'm still married to Elizabeth. 
 Well, technically, you're separated, and correct me if I'm wrong, but I did hear Elizabeth say that she thinks you both should see other people. 
 I know. 
 Look, David, I like you. 
 You're sweet, you're smart, but I don't... I don't want to... 
 I don't want to break up your marriage either. 
 I'm in no rush here. 
 So why don't we just take things slow and we'll see what happens. 
 Deal? 
 Deal. 
 (Gear shifts, car idling) 
 (Bird sighing) 
 I'm really sorry for what I said. 
 Don't be. 
 (Laughs) 
 You're right. 
 I spend money on people because if I don't, I'm afraid they'll want nothing to do with me. 
 Why would you think that? 
 Well, that's the only reason people put up with my parents, so why would I be any different? 
 Because you're talented and funny. 
 The life of the party, Bird. 
 Hell, you are the party. 
 Even if you stopped being everybody's ATM, they're still gonna be crazy about you. 
 You're sweet. 
 All right, I gotta get to work. 
 Thank you for taking this job last minute. 
 It's not like I really had a choice. 
 Somebody spent all of our rent money on bumper cars. 
 (Laughing, door opening) 
 (Knocking) 
 What are you doing here? I thought it was mom's night. 
 I wanted to talk to you. 
 Okay. 
 Talk. 
 (Chair rolling) 
 I'm sorry for not telling you what happened between Lori and me. 
 (Scribing stops) 
 I should have. 
 (Scribing) 
 So if there's anything you want to know, ask me and I'll tell you. 
 Did you love her? 
 No. 
 How long did it last? 
 One night. 
 Then I realized my mistake and it never happened again. 
 Why'd you do it? 
 Your mom and I were having issues at home. 
 Lori was my way to avoid dealing with them, using a physical relationship to hide from your problems. 
 I hope you never have to experience that. 
 It only makes them worse. 
 (Scribing) 
 Anything else? 
 No. 
 I'll let you get back. 
 (Vehicle approaching) 
 (Trunk opening) 
 (Keys jingling) 
 Make sure to lock this place up extra tight. 
 No problem. 
 (Keys jingling) 
 (Trunk opens) 
 You're here early. 
 I left my computer. 
 I thought I'd grab a coffee. 
 Mmm. 
 How was your friendly drink? 
 (Beverage pouring) 
 It was fine. 
 How was your night? 
 Uneventful. 
 I did have a nice heart-to-heart with Carter. 
 Really? 
 Yeah, I think I finally got through to her. 
 That's fantastic. 
 She's beginning to understand the importance of a good education. 
 (Door opening, closing) 
 You gotta be kidding me. 
 (Tires screeching) 
 Good morning, Bird. 
 Is it? 
 I don't remember the last time I was up this early on a Saturday. 
 (Phone ringing) 
 Hey, Max, what's up? 
 I'm fine. 
 Thanks for asking. 
 And thanks again for last night. 
 I honestly don't know what I would do without you in my life. 
 You are never moving out, ever. 
 Hey. 
 Hey. 
 So I was thinking, the test doesn't start for another 30 minutes. 
 Any interest in checking out some Russian literature? 
 Yeah. I could... 
 I could use a little brush up on my Tolstoy.

 Abby : A through G is over here to the right. 
 Hey, Abby. 
 Hi, Gabe. Good seeing you last night. 
 It's good seeing you any time of day. 
 You know, I couldn't help but notice you were flying solo at the fair. 
 No boyfriend? 
 I am not discussing my personal life with you. 
 I discuss my personal life with you. 
 That's different. 
 Why? 
 I'm your guidance counselor. 
 Well, even guidance counselors need guidance from time to time. 
 Your table's that way, Mr. Materos. 
 Thank you, Ms. Baker. 
 Elizabeth. Hey. 
 Hey. 
 I thought we were on the same side, Abby. 
 Excuse me? 
 Carter told me that you met her ex-boyfriend Crash and you thought he was a great guy. 
 I do think he's a great guy. 
 Well, you're wrong. 
 You came all the way down here to tell me that? 
 Yes, I did. Because he's a criminal and we need to work together to keep him out of Carter's life. 
 He's a terrible influence on her. 
 Are you sure about that?

 (Song faintly continues over radio throughout) 
 Here. 
 What's this? 
 I put together a little SAT care package. 
 It's number two pencils, pencil sharpener, extra erasers, a calculator, a banana and an energy drink. 
 Thank you. 
 (Sighs) I'm gonna need all the help I can get. 
 ♪ Used to run if you called my name ♪ 
 You nervous? 
 (Sighing) 
 I just think about Lori. 
 What about her? 
 Not once did she ever ask to see a report card. 
 Never asked about homework. 
 Didn't really care if I cut class. 
 I don't know, maybe she wasn't just being a cool mom after all. 
 Maybe she just didn't care whether I did well or not in school. 
 Why wouldn't she want that? 
 Because if I went off to college, she'd be all alone. 
 That'd be pretty messed up if that were true. 
 Right. 
 But who's more messed up than Lori? 
 Anyway, thank you.

 Where the hell have you been? 
 With Carter, what's up? 
 How about you tell me? 
 Is something wrong? 
 Yeah. 
 Something is. 
 You set me up. 
 Set you up how? 
 The car you had dropped off last night? 
 What about it? 
 Are you really gonna stand there and pretend you didn't know that it was filled with coke? 
 You set me up. 
 I'm not that guy anymore. 
 Tell them, Carter. 
 Really? 
 Crash left you to die. 
 Police! 
 Taylor? 
 He's gone.
