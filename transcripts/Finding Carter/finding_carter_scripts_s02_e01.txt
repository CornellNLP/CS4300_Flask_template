 Woman : Previously on "Finding Carter". 
 Woman : When you were three years old, you were abducted your real parents are here. 
 Do you remember me at all? 
 No, I'm sorry. 
 Your family, you like 'em? 
 Carter : They're total strangers. 
 Hi. 
 Hi. 
 Carter : Mom... 
 I'm sorry. 
 There are things you don't know, things you should know. 
 You looked into my eyes and lied to my face. 
 Carter : Come on, you like Max, right? 
 Taylor : Yeah, a lot. 
 I wish I could've been your first. 
 Who's that? 
 That is a blond-haired, blue-eyed piece of raw sewage. 
 And you can never have anything to do with him again. 
 Do you understand me?! 
 Do you understand me? 
 No-no-no, I can't, I can't do this. 
 Not unless you tell me it's over with David. 
 Your husband knows that you and I are having an affair. 
 We are going to be together. 
 Meet me here tomorrow night. 
 Carter : I don't know what I want. 
 Carter asked me to say good-bye for her. 
 Don't underestimate me, David. 
 You made that mistake once before. 
 Carter : If you don't divorce Elizabeth, then I will let you write your book. 
 Everything he told me was a l... Oh, my God! 
 Elizabeth : She left with him? 
 Whoo! 
 Give us everything in the register. 
 Report it as a robbery. 
 Crash, what the hell are you doing? 
 The safety's on. 
 (Gunshot) 
 Call 9-1-1! 
 Oh, my God. 
 You're under arrest. 
 Crash! 
 Get her away from here! 
 I knew you were gonna follow me 'cause you're my mom. 
 You spent three months with them. 
 How does that wipe out 13 years with me? 
 It was all based on a lie. 
 Max, I'm scared you're breaking up with me. 
 I am. 
 Stalkers are crazy people. 
 I was raised by your stalker? 
 Oh, I didn't order this. 
 It's from your mother. 
 (Voice echoing) Oh, baby, you do not look at all well. 
 You didn't belong with those people. You belong with me. 
 The girl that was sitting here, where'd she go? 
 Waiter : She left with her mom. 
 Carter! 
 Hi. 
 (Voice echoing) Do you wanna play a game of pretend? 
 Shh. 
 It's our secret. 
 ♪ Keep it quiet ♪ 
 She's fine, she's resting. 
 I've got it under control. 
 Look, you... you knew eventually it would come to this. 
 The truth has to come out. 
 It's too late to turn back now. 
 (Chuckling) 
 Are you threatening me?

 Man :  The Coast Guard reported several tank...  
 woman :  Police officer interviewed after the blast. 
 Max : Are these the only channels that they have? 
 I don't get it. 
 There's nothing on the news about Carter being taken. 
 No Amber alert either. 
 It's been four hours. 
 Hey, maybe you could text your dad and see if he's heard anything. 
 Yeah, definitely. 
 It's a media blackout. 
 What are you doing here? 
 Shouldn't you be home? 
 Everyone's just sitting around, staring at each other, waiting to hear from my mom, it's awful. 
 Is it okay... that I'm here? 
 Yeah, of course it's okay. 
 'Cause I know that we're broken up and stuff, but... 
 You guys are broken up? 
 Uh, bird... 
 When did this happen? 
 Maybe we should go get some snacks. 
 Yeah, snacks. 
 Snacks? 
 This seems like the time to get snacks? 
 I'm sorry. 
 For what? 
 Being here, it feels awkward, considering. 
 No, I'm, I'm actually... I'm really glad that you're here. 
 You are? 
 Yeah. 
 If this is where you wanna be, then I'm... 
 It is, this is where I wanna be. 
 I made a really big mistake. 
 Breaking us up, I... 
 I was going through a lot, and I... 
 That'll happen when someone shoots you. 
 Yeah. 
 But I don't wanna be apart. 
 We had a really great thing going. 
 And I think we should have it again, now. 
 Yeah. 
 If that's okay. 
 Yeah. 
 Yeah? 
 I would really like that. 
 (Nervous chuckle) 
 I'd like that, too. 
 Elizabeth : That's it, that's everything. 
 That's every little detail of everything that I know. 
 Now what I need to know is why you ordered a mediblacko. 
 My daughter's been missing for four hours. 
 Unfortunately, I'm not in a position to share that information. 
 I'm sorry, what? 
 This is a federal case now, Miss Wilson. 
 Detective Wilson. 
 We appreciate all the information that you've given us. 
 But the truth is, cop or no cop, you should've never had the authority to oversee the abduction of your own daughter. 
 Which is why you're no longer on the case. 
 You don't have the authority to do that. 
 Actually, I do. 
 And you can bitch and moan about it all your want. 
 But it's not gonna do any good, so... 
 What I would like you to do is go home. 
 And let us know if Carter or Lori Stevens tries to contact you. 
 (Door opens closes) 
 Man : Excuse me, Sir? 
 Mom? 
 Oh, baby. 
 Hey, you're awake. 
 You feeling better, hon? 
 Let me get you some water. 
 Here. Here you go. 
 Everything's gonna be okay, drink. 
 You drugged me. 
 I know, baby, I'm sorry, I had to. 
 But... but it's not anything that ever would've hurt you. 
 You have to know that. 
 It's just... I knew you weren't in a position to hear what I had to say. 
 What did you have to say? 
 You'll know soon, I promise. 
 Can I ask you something? 
 Sure. 
 You know Lori, or you did. 
 Yeah. 
 You don't think that... 
 She would hurt Carter, do you? 
 No. 
 No, I don't think... 
 But I... 
 What? 
 I never thought that she would do this. 
 So you think there's a chance that she... 
 No-no, hey, I think that Carter... is not a little girl anymore. 
 She's tough and smart. 
 I think she's gonna be fine. 
 You really think so? 
 Yeah, I... I really think so. 
 Okay. 
 I'm off the case. 
 They pulled me off the case. 
 David : What? Why? 
 Because I'm her mother, I was too involved. 
 I screwed everything up, okay? 
 It's my fault that she's gone. 
 That is not true. Did they say that? 
 No, they didn't have to, David. 
 I was there when she was taken. 
 Right under my nose. 
 Okay, okay, you... you were doing your job. 
 If you wanna think about who was where when things went down, David was inside the house when Carter was taken from the front lawn! 
 Buddy : All right, that's enough, stop. 
 Mom... 
 For once, can we not make this about blame? 
 Look, it's no one's fault. 
 They are gonna find her, I know they are. 
 Are they? Because I can't do this again. 
 I can't lose our baby again. 
 It's gonna be okay, I promise. 
 How can you say that?! 
 You don't know that, you don't know that's gonna happen! 
 I'll go. 
 (Distant dog barking) 
 Come on. 
 Got a car over here. 
 Hurry... 
 Watch your step. 
 Hold it. 
 Where are we going? 
 We're going to get Taylor. 
 No! Carter! 
 (Tires screeching) 
 No! 
 Aah! 
 Carter, stop! 
 Stop! 
 Just stop. Stop! 
 Get... get off of me. 
 Stop, please. 
 I can't let you go until you and Taylor know the truth. 
 What does Taylor have to do with anything? 
 You'll find out if you'll just calm down and let me handle this, okay? 
 Here, here. 
 Look at this, look, look. 
 (Clicking) All right. 
 I need you text that picture to Taylor so they know you're okay. 
 Tell her to meet us at Clifton's Diner on route 50 in two hours. 
 Okay? 
 Why are you doing this? 
 Oh, baby... 
 (Sobbing) Oh, baby, I'm... 
 I'm so sorry you're upset. 
 I know it's hard. 
 Stop, just stop. 
 (Sobbing) 
 Look, look, look. 
 I need you to think for a minute, okay? 
 About us. 
 Before all of this happened. 
 Before you knew the Wilsons even existed. 
 I love you, Carter. 
 I always have, and you are everything to me. 
 I need you to remember all that, okay? 
 Remember, remember how it was. 
 Remember us. 
 Yeah, I remember. 
 But you are not the person I knew. 
 You're so different. 
 No, I'm not. 
 Yes, you are. 
 No, baby. 
 The only thing that's different is the circumstances. 
 And that is not our fault. 
 And it's not fair. 
 Just remember, please. 
 Just give me one last chance, that's all I am asking. 
 Please. 
 Please, please, do it, please. 
 (Sniffling) 
 Please, baby. 
 (Phone chimes) 
 Oh, my God. 
 What? 
 It's a photo of Lori and Carter. 
 And it says to meet them in two hours and to come alone. 
 David : Obviously, she's not going alone. 
 Elizabeth : She's not going at all. 
 We have to decide before she gets home. 
 Lori's gonna be at that diner with Carter. 
 God knows what she'll do if no one's there. 
 Gotta call the FBI. 
 No, and have a replay of what happened before? No way. 
 She said no cops. 
 What other option do we have? 
 Dad, we're not involving the feds. 
 Look, you're just upset because they took you off the case. 
 Joan, please. 
 Look, someone's gotta go! 
 Joan, we will decide who's going. 
 Could you give us a minute, please? 
 Certainly. 
 Liz, let's just slow down, we... 
 We need to talk about some things. 
 What things? 
 Things about Lori. 
 What about her? Something that will help us find Carter? 
 No. 
 Then, baby, whatever it is, it can wait. 
 Because we have to decide what we're going to do right now. 
 ♪♪ 
♪ Do you hear the voices? ♪ 
♪ Keep it quiet ♪ 
♪ keep it quiet ♪ 
 Lori : Let's go for a ride. 
 Mommy, where's Lyndon? 
 Elizabeth : It's just too dangerous, David. 
 I'm going. 
 No, no, absolutely not, you're not walking in that diner. 
 It's not your choice. 
 Taylor, the hell it isn't. 
 What's going on? 
 Hang on, Joan. 
 Ever since I stood in that doorway and watched Lori drive away with Carter, I have had to live every day knowing that I couldn't help anyone. 
 Not Carter. 
 Not you, no one. 
 And I've dreamt a thousand times that I ran down that street and stopped them. 
 And now I get to look that woman in the eye... 
 And I get to do something. 
 I'm going. 
 Kyle : Almost finished, Taylor. 
 There we go. 
 You okay? 
 Yeah. 
 I'll be able to hear everything. 
 I'll be right outside. 
 I don't understand why she has to wear a wire. 
 I mean, isn't it enough that she's confronting this maniac? 
 Mom, Lori might think that I'm wired, but she's never gonna check Taylor, it's safer this way. 
 What's going on? 
 Honey... 
 Taylor's going? 
 I'm going with her. 
 But why does she have to go? Why does anyone have to go? 
 Why can't the police just do their damn jobs? 
 It's okay, everything's gonna be okay. 
 I promise, I'm not gonna let anything happen to anyone. 
 Like you didn't let anything happen to Carter? 
 Like you didn't? 
 Grant, wait, I wanna go. 
 It's... it's gonna be fine. 
 I promise. 
 Can you do me a favor? 
 Max texted me from the hospital, and his mom hasn't showed up. 
 So could you and gammy go and get him and bring him back here? 
 It would be really helpful. 
 That's a great idea. 
 And then we can all meet back here. 
 Okay, we need to go. 
 (Quietly) Thank you. 
 Hey! Menus. 
 Um, where would you like to sit? 
 Uh, booth. 
 Here, just act natural, look at your menu. 
 This might come as a huge surprise, but I'm really not that hungry. 
 Thanks. 
 Elizabeth : I'll give you the signal when it's safe to move in. 
 Don't do anything until then. 
 Kyle : Liz, be careful. 
 Elizabeth : Are you okay, Carter? 
 Yeah. 
 You were supposed to come alone. 
 There was no way that was ever happening. 
 Yeah, just as well. 
 You'll wanna hear the truth. 
 Slide in next to your sister. 
 Better not be any other cops around. 
 Get in. 
 Get in. 
 Well, we're all here. 
 Why don't you go ahead and tell us what was so important that you had to kidnap me? 
 Again. 
 Again. 
 I need you to know I am not the bad guy here. 
 You're not the bad guy? Then what are you, exactly? 
 I am your real mother. And I'm Taylor's mother, too. 
 What is she talking about? 
 Female, age 23. 5'8" tall, brown hair, brown eyes. Graduate of Jacobsen Nursing College, June, 1996. Health: excellent. Marital status: single. Siblings: none. Donor number 3-5-2-6. 
 What is she talking about? 
 Mom? Tell us. 
 I couldn't get pregnant.  Your dad and I tried for three years.  Went to a clinic, and they said they could help. That's when we decided to look for an egg donor. 
 They chose me. I was donor number 3-5-2-6. 
 
 
 
 My mom got her wires crossed. Thought I was being discharged tomorrow. 
 These things happen. 
 Have you heard anything? 
 My mom went with, uh, Taylor to meet Carter and Lori. 
 Yeah, I know. 
 How do you know? 
 Taylor texted me before they left. 
 Why didn't you stop her? 
 Because you realize, right, that everyone in my family is now in the presence of a crazy person. 
 And everybody's just acting like this is stuff that happens every day, like it's normal. 
 Darling, no one thinks that anything that goes on in this family is remotely normal. 
 This isn't funny, she could kill them all. 
 Hey, buddy, calm down. 
 All right, your mom and dad are both there with her. 
 Gabe's dad's there too. 
 They're not gonna let anything happen to anybody. 
 But they let her get kidnapped again. 
 They knew where she is. 
 They're with her. 
 And you know something else? 
 Carter is much smarter than Lori. 
 Okay, she's way ahead of her, I guarantee Carter has a plan. 
 Okay? 
 All right? All right? 
 Good, better? 
 Yes. 
 Hey, why don't you go and get the nurse? 
 Tell 'em we're ready to leave. 
 Sooner we get home, the sooner we see 'em, okay? 
 You're very good with him, you know? 
 Thank you. He's a good kid. 
 I can see why you and Taylor would be an item. 
 I should warn you, though. 
 All the Wilson women are bonkers. 
 It's... it's genetic. 
 Ah, your chariot awaits. 
 There we go. 
 Mom. 
 Why didn't you tell us? 
 Your father and I, we wanted to tell you  when you were older, but then...  
 We never got a chance. 
 What about me? 
 I mean, you had a chance to tell me. 
 I know, sweetie, but the idea of telling you alone without Carter, it was just another reminder... 
 (Banging table) 
 What is it that you want from us? 
 I only want is family. I am their mother and I have rights. 
 You don't have any rights. 
 You never did, and you never will. 
 Where is it you think that kind of attitude is gonna get us? 
 Maybe in the eyes of the law I have no rights., but in the eyes of human beings and the eyes of God, I do. 
 Meaning what? 
 Meaning... 
 All I have ever wanted is to come to some kind of arrangement without the involvement of the police where I can be a part of my daughters' lives. 
 (Whispering) Let me make this perfectly clear to you. 
 That is never going to happen. 
 Then guess what? 
 None of us are leaving here. 
 Carter :  What did you think was going to happen? 
 That we just walk away with you and live happily ever after? 
 I thought you'd start to see things differently when you knew the truth. 
 Carter, you know me. 
 You know I would never intentionally hurt you. 
 And you and I, we both know what it's like to lose a child. 
 I honestly thought as... as a mother, you would understand what I'm going through and want to help. 
 Help? 
 You kidnapped my daughter, and now you're holding her against her will. 
 I should've known better than to expect any understanding from you. 
 You don't seem to know what it means to be a mother. 
 That you would do anything to be with your kids. 
 She looked for me for 13 years. 
 You ruined her life. 
 You ruined all of our lives. 
 No, I didn't. 
 They did. 
 When you two were babies, I tried to contact them anonymously to let them know that I was the donor. 
 They wouldn't even meet me. 
 We didn't have to meet you. 
 That's the deal that you made when you donated. 
 We're not talking about deals. 
 We are talking about human beings, babies and mothers. 
 This is why I knew I had to tell the two of you in person so that you would understand. 
 Things are not as simple as they sound. 
 You are my blood. 
 You are a part of me. 
 I am your mother. 
 You are not my mother. 
 You have... you have to stop staying that. 
 Honey... 
 The only reason you feel that way is because I had the decency to leave you there with her. 
 Oh, my God. 
 What is that supposed to mean? 
 I could've taken you. 
 I had absolutely every right to. 
 But I know what it feels like to lose a child, and I didn't want her to lose you both. 
 And this is how I'm repaid. 
 You... 
 Are gonna get exactly what you deserve. 
 Prison. 
 Really? 
 That's what I deserve? 
 What is it you think you deserve? 
 Because whatever happens next, you brought it on yourself. 
 Stop, please, just stop! 
 Shh. Quiet, you'll attract attention. 
 Taylor, come here, it's okay. 
 (Static crackles)  What happened? 
 Someone pulled the wire. 
 Who? 
 I don't know. 
 Wait, what... Elizabeth said not to go in until she gave a signal. 
 For all I know, that was the signal, okay? 
 I can't leave them in there without communication. 
 I'm coming with you. 
 No! 
 We don't know what's going on in there, okay? 
 I need you to stay here. 
 Don't move until I tell you. 
 (Car door closes) 
 Lori : This woman has no concept of what it means to be a mother. 
 From the very beginning, she tried to keep me away from you. 
 That's a cop, go! Let's go. 
 No. Not you, don't you move a muscle, or you will be very sorry. 
 Come on, let's go, now. 
 No, leave Taylor, I'll go with you. 
 Go. 
 Stop it. 
 Walk in front of me. 
 Leave her, I'll go! 
 Oh! 
 Call 9-1-1 now! 
 Go! 
 Go, get in. 
 No. 
 Now. No, you can't take Taylor. 
 I'm not gonna say this again. 
 Get in the car. 
 Run! Go! 
 Aah! 
 Mom! 
 Mom, are you okay? 
 (Wailing siren approaching) 
 Elizabeth : And I thought I was the tough one in the family. 
 You okay? 
 Yeah, it's just a minor abrasion. 
 Hey. 
 It's okay. 
 It's all over. 
 Um... 
 So, uh... 
 What happens now? 
 Well, now I get to take you home. 
 I, um, I meant to Lori? 
 Well, she'll spend the night in jail. 
 And then she'll see her lawyer and the judge in the morning. 
 Hey. Hey. 
 How you doing? 
 Oh, I'm... I'm fine. 
 I just gave my statement. 
 Your FBI friend wants to see you. 
 (Sighing) Oh, great. 
 Okay, I will be right back, and then... 
 I'm taking us home. 
 All right, sue me. 
 Waterboard me, do whatever you guys do over there. 
 I got my daughter back. That's all I care about. 
 We'll need you to give a statement... obviously. 
 And to testify. 
 Of course. 
 I'd like to watch your follow-up if that's okay with you. 
 It's not standard procedure. 
 I think we both established that's not my priority. 
 Well, since you did help us nab her, I'm willing to let you observe. 
 She'll be lawyering up soon. 
 Should have her back here in a day or two. 
 Thank you. 
 I been thinking... 
 Maybe the FBI should start recruiting a few more mothers. 
 Maybe they should. 
 How does it feel? 
 How does what feel? 
 Living in denial. 
 Uh-huh, I'm living in denial because... 
 You're the one getting fingerprinted. 
 You think what I told you about being your egg donor is the whole story? It's not. 
 Why would I believe one word that you say? 
 You're about to go to prison. 
 Because I know things. 
 I knew the truth about the egg donation, didn't I? 
 (Scoffing) 
 Don't believe me, ask David. 
 What are you saying, that David knew that you were the egg donor? 
 No, I'm not saying that. 
 But he knows other things. 
 Important things you would want to know. 
 You are a sick... 
 Delusional felon. 
 That's all I need to know. 
 Is it? 
 Because I am not the only one to blame here. 
 David did a number on both of us. 
 Yeah. 
 Go ahead, ask him. 
 I dare you. 
 Elizabeth : Hey! 
 They're here! 
 Buddy : Oh, thank God. 
 Hi, mom. 
 Hey, Max. Oh, sweetheart. 
 It's nothing, mom, it's just a little scuffle. 
 A little scuffle? 
 Yeah, a major scuffle, mom. 
 Lori tried to take us both with her. 
 What is wrong with that woman? 
 Grant : Well, I think it's called insanity. 
 Dad tackled her. 
 Carter : Yeah, it was very Vin Diesel. 
 Good move. 
 Oh, I'm... I'm impressed. 
 Thank you, Joan. 
 I... I didn't know you had it in you. 
 Okay, okay, thank you, mom, thank you. 
 Why don't we go and get something to eat? 
 Everyone's so sensitive. 
 So, is this like a hugging moment? 
 Yeah, this is definitely a hugging moment. 
 You know, I can tell that you cheated right there. 
 You ordered that in. 
 How are you doing? 
 I'm okay. 
 Mm-hmm? 
 Yeah. 
 I feel like I'm caught in the middle of a really great family vibe here. 
 I'm glad you're here. 
 We're all glad you're here. 
 I'll call my mom in the morning, she'll come pick me... 
 What? 
 Call your mom, no, Max, you're staying here. 
 Yeah, Max. 
 I, I just don't wanna be in the way. 
 Not at all. 
 (Overlapping chatter) 
 I mean, if you're sure. 
 Of course we're sure. Listen, Taylor told me you had to do physical therapy every day. 
 That's too far to drive. 
 Yeah... you're pushy, honey. 
 I'm pushy? 
 Yeah, he said he'd stay. 
 Okay, you're staying, it's settled. 
 Good choice. 
 It never pays to argue with the Wilson women. It never ends. 
 I'll second that emotion. 
 Grant, honey, set the table, would you? 
 Hey. 
 Hi. 
 Your mom and I wanted to talk to you guys about this egg donor business. 
 Okay. 
 Well, I guess what I wanted to say was, no matter what we found out about our biology, that the time that I had you, um... 
 When you were babies... 
 It doesn't change anything. 
 What she said, if that's what you're worried about. 
 Well, we thought we should talk about it. 
 You mean the fact that you never told us? 
 Or me even though I was with you the whole time? 
 Honey, I explained to you... yeah. Yeah, yeah, you did. 
 But it doesn't matter. 
 We don't have to talk about it anymore. 
 Ever. 
 I'm gonna go help Max. 
 Tay... 
 She just needs time to process. 
 We just wanted to apologize. 
 I should've told you before. 
 Thanks. 
 But... 
 Just to be clear. 
 We are done with all the lies, right? 
 Please? 
 Yes, no more lies. 
 Okay. 
 (Sniffles) 
 (Knocking on door) 
 Hey. 
 Hi. 
 What are you doing? 
 I don't know, just... 
 Thought I'd sleep down here tonight. 
 You know, the stairs, kind of difficult to navigate. 
 Yeah, yeah, of course. 
 Do you want me to sleep down here tonight? 
 No, that's okay. 
 It's been a pretty big day. 
 We could probably both use some rest. 
 Yeah, yeah. 
 All right? 
 Definitely. 
 Yeah. 
 Okay, well, I'll see you in the morning. 
 Okay, okay. 
 Night. 
 Night. 
 David : What is it? 
 What's wrong? 
 I'm scared. 
 It's over. 
 They're home. 
 She can't hurt us anymore. 
 She already has. 
 Did you see how angry Taylor is, how distant? 
 Well, you heard what she said. 
 She wants to move past this. 
 She just needs time. 
 I never wanted them to know. 
 I was gonna take the secret to my grave. 
 Now they'll never feel like I'm their mother. 
 Oh... 
 You're wrong. 
 Am I? 
 You're the only mother Taylor's ever had. 
 You're the only mother Carter wants. 
 There's nothing that woman can say that will change any of that.
