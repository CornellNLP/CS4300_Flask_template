 Carter : Previously on "Finding Carter"... 
 Baby, you do not look at all well. 
 You didn't belong with those people, all right? 
 You belong with me. 
 Lori, echoing : I've got it under control. 
 You knew eventually it would come to this. 
 The truth has to come out. 
 Elizabeth : I couldn't get pregnant. 
 When we decided to look for an egg donor... 
 They chose me. I am your real mother. 
 That's a cop. Go! 
 Carter : No, please. 
 (Grunting, struggling) 
 Run! 
 Ah! 
 No matter what we find out about us... 
 It doesn't change anything, if that's what you're worried about. 
 Crash, what the hell are you doing? 
 The safety's on. 
 Call 911! 
 Oh, God. 
 Taylor : Is it okay that I'm here? 
 Max : Yeah. But I don't want to be apart. 
 We had a really great thing going. 
 We should have it again. 
 I would really like that. 
 Carter : Crash? 
 What are you doing here? 
 You know what, it doesn't matter. 
 I don't care. I don't want to see you. 
 I'm not here to see you. I'm here to see Max. 
 Max : Crash, man, you gotta knock it off. 
 You're a good person. 
 You didn't deserve what I did. 
 Are you out of your mind? 
 I just saw Crash drop you off. 
 He almost killed you! 
 People change. 
 Yeah, you must be right. 
 Because I don't know who you are anymore. 
 Was there something between you and Lori? 
 Lori : I was having an affair with David Wilson when Carter and Taylor were a year old. 
 David : I can't tell Elizabeth about Lori. This is the lie that is going to destroy us. If you tell her now, she might forgive you. David : What if your mother can't forgive me. David, muffled : Elizabeth, please... Elizabeth, muffled : How could you do this? David, muffled : Yes, I made a decision... A wrong decision. I was in a bad place. Elizabeth, muffled : All these years, I trusted you. I'm so sorry. I can't even begin to understand any of this. I should have told you years ago. I wanted to. You have no idea how much. How did Carter know? She confronted me. Elizabeth, muffled : With what? David, muffled : My photo from Lori's housemate. I guess 13 years of Carter's life wasn't enough for Lori. She had to take you and Taylor from me too. She hasn't taken anyone. Taylor is your daughter. Carter is too. David, muffled : And I'm your husband. Hey, what's going on? Oh, they're just talking. About what? I don't know, I couldn't really hear. David speaking indistinctly : Are you okay? What? Yeah. You look like you've been crying. I broke up with Max. What? Why? It's just this whole Crash thing. You know, I... I get it. I get that Max is a nice guy. But... some things are just unforgivable. I mean, does everybody just get to do whatever they want and then it's just supposed to be okay? Tay, you're both going through so much right now. Do you really think now is the time to break up? I was ready to give up everything for Max when he got shot. I mean, school, my future. And now it seems like... Forgiving Crash is more important to him than I am. (Muffled arguing continues) That's not true. Well, Max is fine with it, so... Yeah, because he's Max. That's not how he really feels, though. How do you know? Because I do, Tay. We're best friends. I know how much he cares about you. Elizabeth, muffled : You should have told me first! David, muffled : Oh, don't you think I know that? Okay, that sounds like a fight. Well... People fight. Doesn't mean you have to break up. I don't really want to talk about this. ♪ Falling down ♪ Wait, don't go. ♪ So heavy ♪ Tay? (Door closes) ♪ It's hard laying down ♪ Do you think they heard? Why? Why did you sleep with her? We had two little babies. I don't know. I don't. We were having problems... If I could go back and change it, Liz, I swear, I would. It's not like I don't get it. The loneliness you felt, the sadness. I was there, and you forgave me. It's not about an indiscretion. It's about what it turned into. The horror. She stole our daughter. If I'd known how sick she was, you have to know, Liz, if I thought for a minute she would ever have done what she did, I would have stopped her. I would have told you then and there. When Carter went missing, you didn't. You didn't say a word. It was two years later. I didn't know there was a connection. But when they found her and you knew who took her... I thought this was my fault. I'm responsible for Carter's kidnapping. And that's what I'll never get past. ♪ There you go ♪

♪ (Knocking at door) Yeah. Oh, hey, buddy. Good morning. I'm supposed to get Carter. Hey. Sorry, we were up late talking. Family meeting in the living room. About what? Who knows? But I'm not getting a "Hey, kids!, we're going to Disneyland" vibe out of it. (Sighing) They're getting divorced. You don't know that. Yes, I do. Nothing is certain. This is all my fault. I should have made him go to Elizabeth sooner. It's not your fault. What did you think when your parents got divorced? I thought it was my fault. Look, maybe they'll break up, maybe they won't. But it's not yours to fix. No. I can fix this. I do love your enthusiasm. You're not going anywhere. You and Taylor are gonna fix this. Carter, I'm dumped. Okay, I'm done. I've gotta pack up, get my truck fixed. Head back to Pennsylvania. Max, please be here when I get home from school. Carter : I'm coming! Sorry, sorry. I'm here. Okay. Your mom and I wanted to talk to you as soon as possible. It's probably not a big shock. Your mom and I, we've been having problems. And, uh, in order to deal with these problems, we think it's best... What? Your father and I are separating. Separating... what, like living apart? Yeah. Why? We've been through a lot, and we just need some time. For what? It's very complicated. But you're not getting divorced, right? No. Definitely not. At least... Neither of us wants that. I don't... I don't understand. Honey, we... we just have some stuff that we need to work through. But we love each other very much. And, uh... we hope everything will go back to normal, really soon. Are we moving? No, you are staying here. Are you leaving? We are gonna take turns sleeping here, so when I'm not here, I'll probably stay at my office. And your mom... I don't know. Grandma's? Isn't grandma and grandpa's anniversary party tonight? I forgot. Yeah, so did I. Grandma has this friend flying in that she wants me to meet. Who's that? She's the Dean of Admissions at Stanford. I mean, I know that it's selfish, but... No, it's not selfish. We'll go. Just the two of you? No. No, come on, we should all go. Dad too. I'd like that. Great. So, on the anniversary of my parents' marriage, I have to tell them that... Mom, you don't have to tell them anything. So, lie? It's just a lie of omission. And, you're okay with that? I'm learning that some things are better kept private, yeah. Okay, fine. Cocktails at 7:00. (School bell ringing) Carter! Wait! Hey. Why are mom and dad separating? You heard them, Tay. They have problems. Okay, what problems? I mean, you heard them last night. Is it Kyle, or something that Lori did? I don't know, Tay. I told you I couldn't really hear what they were saying. Look... I don't understand any of this. I mean, we just got our family back together. The woman who kidnapped you is in jail. We should be happy, but now mom and dad are separating, and you don't seem the least bit surprised. Or pissed off. I mean, is there something that you're not telling me? (Cell phone ringing) Who's number is this? (Ringing continues) Woman on phone : You have a call from... Lori Stevens... at the Central County Correctional Facility. It's Lori. What? Please press one to accept. She's calling from County. Oh, my God. Well, what did she say? I don't know, it was a recorded message... Saying "press one 1 to accept" the call. Don't. (Phone beeps) Look, I have to get to class. Okay. Let's go. I can't go to the party tonight. (Door closing) I get it. The next few weeks are gonna be hard. But everything is gonna be okay. Well, my suit doesn't fit, and the Country Club won't let me in if I'm not wearing a suit. Is that why you can't go tonight? I told you three months ago. Yep, you did. Sorry. All right, um... You can skip school, come with me to work, and after my class we will go buy you a suit. ♪ I'm getting older ♪ 
♪ I don't think they really like me ♪

♪ Max : The water pump is leaking. Blown head gasket. I think the brakes are shot too. Looks like a couple thousand dollars worth of work. And, uh... Yeah, you need new tires. I'll take care of it. Yeah, I can pay in installments, I just... I need to get home. What about rehab? It's gonna have to wait. Stay here. Get your own place. Dude, I don't have any cash. Get a job. I did have a job... 'Til you shot me. Work here. Come on, my uncle is in his office. I'll introduce you. No, no, really. Thank you, though. Hey, at least let me drop you off at Carter's until your truck gets fixed. That I will take you up on. Hey. Hey. I don't know if I can do this. You know, dress up and smile and pretend everything is okay. I can't even imagine how painful this must be. I can't. But I know dad loves you. So much. Please, can you try and remember that? I'm trying, baby. It just... it doesn't seem like enough right now. Her face, everything that she said, I just ca... I can't stop thinking about it. I have to go through every minute of our lives and try to figure it out. I just... I feel alone. Mom... I'm here. (Laughs, cries, sniffles) We're all still here. I know. Thank you. I know. It doesn't matter what she said in that room. Okay, she's Lori. She knew you were listening. She was manipulating you. It's what she does. But we can't let her ruin us, okay? She doesn't get to win. You're right. Again. Okay. Okay... What about this one? What's wrong with that one? Yeah. Yeah! No. No? I need to go shopping. We should go shopping. You guys need anything? Uh, yeah, okay. Um... I don't think Taylor's home yet. Oh. Have you talked to her? How is she doing? Not good. Did you know she and Max broke up last night? (Car approaching) Is that her? Oh, okay, cool. I'll get my purse. Unbelievable. What? What's going on around here? You got it? Yeah. Elizabeth : Hey! Get out of here! He was just dropping me off. If we could just talk, detective Wilson... Save it! And congratulations on escaping justice... again! But you're not welcome in my house. And you're not allowed near my family. You need to go. All right. Thank you for the ride. Hmm. You, inside. I'll be right in. Carter! Mom, please. Why did you come here? It's what Max said. Okay, why couldn't you drop him off a block away? Because then there would be no chance of seeing you. I'm sorry I upset your mom. Yeah, well, you're not the only upsetting thing that's been happening around here recently. I... I won't come back. Or to school, or to Bird's... If that's what you want. Is that what you want? You know, I have a lot of... Really serious stuff going on with my family right now. I can't think about this. ♪ I defend I defend my honor ♪ Does Taylor know that you're hanging out with Crash? We're not hanging out. Is he the reason why you two broke up? Part of it, yes. And he's worth losing her over? No, but he's not worth me walking around the rest of my life hating him. Max... he almost killed you. He made a mistake. Don't do that. Don't trivialize it. I'm not. I just want to forgive him... And move on. Sorry. Class went long. All right, just one more thing to take care of. Hilary, this is my son. Hi, nice to meet you. Hey. Hilary is my teaching assistant. Cool. The department meeting is now. I'm supposed to remind you. Oh, I can't make it. Oh. Professor Martin specifically asked about you. Well, just tell Professor Martin whatever you have to. Grant and I are having a father-son day. I'll say that you ate the Chicken Kiev in the cafeteria and you had to leave. (Both chuckling) Barfing. Lots and lots of it. David : Perfect. See you tomorrow. Yeah, see ya. Bye. All right? Come on. What are we doing in here? Just trust me. Pick a suit. For what? My grandparents' party is tonight. I'm not going to that. Yes you are, Max. What about Taylor? Yeah, Taylor will be there too. Max... My family is falling apart right now, okay? We want you there. My grandma wants you there! Yeah, but Taylor... Taylor is gonna have some Stanford person with her. She'll be in a really good mood. It could be really good timing. For what? Max, you love her. That's not the problem. Don't you still love her? I'm not sure that she loves me. Okay, well, how are you gonna find out if you go back to Pennsylvania? Max, you two are so good together. Okay? I get that you've both got a lot going on. But if you can't make a relationship work right now, can you please at least try and still be friends? Red is my color. ♪ You know about it ♪ 
♪ Right in your pocket ♪ 
♪ I'm not dating my T.A. Why not? Because I'm married to your mother. You and mom are separated, though. As of this morning. So, you're saying if you had more time, you'd be dating her. No, I'm not saying that. So you want to stay with mom? Yes. Does mom want to stay with you? I hope so, Grant. I really do. You like this suit? Not really, but... No one seems to care about what I like. Grant : Hey, look, there's mom. Hey. What are you guys doing here? Grant grew out of his suit. Well, you should have told me. I could have taken him. No, no, I don't mind. I'm happy to do it. I'm gonna go check out the video games. Grant's feeling... He needs to know I'm not going anywhere. I'm not trying to force you out of the family, David. I didn't say that. I just want to reassure him. I just don't want Grant to think that I'm the bad guy here. That's not what this is about. 
 
 Taylor : I am not wearing this. Carter : It's so nice. Taylor : Mom! I don't like it. Oh, come on, you look amazing. David : That is too revealing. Hi, dad. Hi. Carter thinks that I should slut it up. Carter is wrong. Very wrong. (Cell phone ringing) So, you wear it with a sweater. Then after your meeting with the Stanford lady, then you can slut it up. Taylor : Oh, my God. Mom, dad? Lori just tried to call me. What? (Carter sighing) She tried to call me earlier as well. When? When I was at school. Why is she calling me? Because I hung up on her? How did she get Taylor's number? Carter : I don't know. Maybe she looked through my phone when I was passed out? Well, this just gets better and better. I'm calling the Warden to file a complaint. Yeah, and we should change the girls' phone numbers. No, you know what, it's fine, I got it. What are you doing? Blocking her number. Do you think that's gonna stop her? Why can't she just leave us alone? What does she want with us? Carter : Oh. Taylor : Wow, they've really gone all out. ♪ And he's not begging ♪ What is Max doing here? Max is here? Is he wearing my suit? Did you invite him? Yeah. Grandma's crazy about Max. Well, grandma's not his girlfriend. Neither are you. You guys are so annoying. Really? ♪ I'll take you all the way, no, no ♪ Yes, please! Oh! You're 21? This is my grandparents' party. Yeah, well, that's not proof of age, so... Well, I'm visiting from college. Oh, yeah? What school? Stanford. Environmental Studies with a Minor in Economics. Really? I feel that it's not enough to find new ways to save the planet. You have to really, really annoy people about it. All right, take a drink. Joan : Taylor, time for photos. Okay? Mm-hmm. Thank you. You're welcome. Duty calls. All right, Grant, why don't you come stand in front of, uh, grandpa. Come here. Taylor and Carter right here in front of us. And Elizabeth, come next to me. David, you're, um... I'm next to Buddy. Ah, yes, you are. Okay, picture on three. One, two... ah! Good. Okay, one more for safety. And girls, can you just switch places? Okay, grandma. What difference does it make? Buddy : I find it best not to argue. Smile, everybody. Show teeth! One more for safety. I thought that was the safety? Mom, enough. Something going on? Joan, why don't you do one with just the women? Sounds good to me. Can you not direct, please, David? That's her job. Well, actually, grandma has something else to do with the girls. Okay. Have you spoken to Max yet? Why would I talk to him? Taylor, do you really think right now is the best time to break up with someone that you care so much about? Carter, leave it alone. Girls, I want you to meet my friend, Anne Wallace. Hi. This is my granddaughter, Taylor. My granddaughter, Carter. Hi. So, this is Carter. Nice to meet you. Oh, hi. Yeah, nice to meet you too. So, grandma says that you guys went to school together? And I never left. Anne is the Dean of Admissions. Oh. Um, yeah, we heard. Joan : So, I need to go back up. You be good to my granddaughters. Okay. So, uh... did you fly out just for the party? I did. And you should fly out to California sometime. I'd be happy to arrange a campus tour. I would love that. I'm applying to Stanford for Environmental Studies with a Minor in Economics. Excellent. Yeah, I think that... Conservation is really our only hope. But, we need to develop the technologies and... You know, find a way to market them. Well, you've given this a lot of thought. What about you? Me? Where do you see yourself going to school? Oh. (Scoffing) I don't know. Um, Taylor's the smart one. She's got like a 4.0 GPA. Well, you should think about Stanford too. Why? Because you have an amazing story. Life experience. Your grandmother said you'd been missing for 13 years? Well, I mean, you know... I knew where I was. Well, we've had some amazing women come through our school. Each with a perspective all their own. Sally Ride, Sandra Day O'Connor, your grandmother... Yeah, and, uh... hopefully my sister one day, too. Yes, Taylor, you're an excellent candidate. Can I have someone from our admissions team give you a call? It was so nice to meet you. You too, dear. Taylor, where are you going? Have a great night. I'm giving you an opportunity here. I want you to think about your future. Yeah, well... Seems like the most interesting thing about me is my past. ♪♪
