 Previously on "The Night Shift"...  
 This is Agent Milo Osbourne of the D.E.A. 
 Milo : FBI's been tracking a small plane that was flying low over the border, carrying suspected smugglers. 
 Anybody else on board? 
 This was the only guy. 
 I'll take that for evidence. How soon can I talk to him? 
 Hey, we have to stabilize him first, so just wait outside. 
 There's a chemical factory explosion in Selma. 
 This place is gonna be swamped in no time. 
 Where the hell are T.C. and Topher? 
 They should've been down here by now. 
 Why is this door locked? 
 Come on! Hey! Get in here! 
 Oh, my God. 
 Right there. Get against that wall. Right there. 
 Oh, God. Oh, God. [Grunts] 
 T.C., Topher, and Jordan are in a hostage situation. 
 Right now, it is on you. 
 You're gonna see some scary things tonight. 
 Know the patient is always more scared than you. 
 Landry, can you help with intake and assist 'em with triage? 
 Whatever you need. And, Drew, you got this. 
 Oh, my God, Dwayne. 
 Hey! Stop it! 
 Uhh! 
 Think I'm playing, Doc? 
 [Silenced gunshot] 
 Uhh! 
 Commander : It's almost go time. We're starting with flash bangs. 
 Jordan : No! 
 [Loud bang] 
 [Silenced gunshot] 
 T.C. : Toph? 
 Jordan : Oh, God, Topher! 
 [Ragged breathing] 
 T.C. : [Voice echoing] Topher. 
 Toph! 
 Jordan : [Voice echoing] Topher, we got you, okay? 
 We're here. 
 T.C. : Come on, Toph. 
 Toph? 
 Come on, Toph! Stay with me, buddy! 
 It's okay, Topher. We got you. 
 Make some room! 
 Kenny : Everybody, come on! Outta the way! Outta the way! 
 [Grunts] 
 [All shouting at once] I know. I know! 
 We will get to you. We'll get to you and you, yes. 
 Mollie : Calm down. 
 Yes, I know this is hard for everybody. 
 Man : Please, lady. Come on. 
 And I can only imagine what you are going through. 
 Man : Lady, come on. 
 We are trying everything we can right now to identify who is here. 
 The victims have been spread out across several hospitals. 
 So if you just bear with us, the nurses will take down your information, and we will let you know what we know. Okay? 
 Woman : Wait! 
 Woman : We need to know something! 
 Man : How long? 
 Okay, thank you. 
 Woman : I don't wanna stay here for nothin'! 
 Man : Come on, lady! You gotta give us more than that! 
 [Lowered voice] What a mess. 
 [Lowered voice] Yeah. Everybody needs an answer, and I don't have it. How's Topher? 
 Not looking good. 
 T.C. is with him, and Scott's on his way in. 
 I just got off the phone with Dwayne's family. 
 They'll be here soon. [Inhales deeply] 
 And when I'm done speaking with them, I'll come back and I'll help you here. 
 Okay. Thanks. That'd be great. 
 Mm. 
 Commander : Mr. Ragosa? 
 We've cleared everything. 
 He's with the shooter right now. 
 Okay. 
 Wish it would've played out a bit differently. 
 Thank you for all your help. 
 [Siren wailing] 
 I need 8 units of B-positive blood, typed and crossed. 
 Kenny, send a trauma panel and set up for intubation. 
 Kenny : Got it. 
 Did you call Scott? 
 He's on his way in, about 10 minutes out. 
 Someone needs to call his wife Janet. She needs to be here now. 
 Jocelyn : I'm on it. 
 Stay with me, buddy. 
 Grab me a central line kit. 
 [Monitor beeping rapidly] 
 Hand me a mac 3. 
 I can't help but think that... maybe if I'd figured out what you were trying to say to me, I could've... 
 No, no, no, no. You... you couldn't have known. 
 Maybe Topher doesn't get shot because you were trying to protect me. 
 Jordan, I was never gonna lose you. 
 The guy's a scumbag who shot Dwayne in cold blood. 
 You are not responsible for any of this. 
 You understand? 
 Ragosa : Guys? 
 I know this is going to be awkward, but the shooter needs medical attention. 
 Screw him. 
 That's too bad. 
 I know how you feel. I... 
 No, you don't. 
 You're right. I don't. 
 But we have to treat him. 
 Send Drew. 
 Drew is overwhelmed with the factory victims. 
 Paul and Krista are too inexperienced to do it alone. 
 Look, under normal circumstances, I'd be sending you home, Jordan. 
 You're the attending. You have to do this. 
 [Monitor beeping steadily] 
 I'm okay here. Scott's on his way in. 
 [Inhales deeply] Just get it over and done with and come back here. 
 [Siren wailing in distance] 
 Drew : Another factory victim? 
 Female with full-body second and third-degree burns. 
 B.P.'s 60 systolic. Oxygen is low. 
 Trauma 3 right here. Krista, Paul, you're with me. 
 Gave her a dose of morphine for the pain. 
 Okay, get ready. 
 Very careful, people. On my count. 
 One, two, three. 
 [Grunts] 
 Paul, I need you to come with me. 
 Yeah. 
 Hey. How's Toph? 
 Not good. 
 But T.C.'s with him, and Scott's on his way. 
 Let's go. 
 Milo : [Groans] You gotta be kidding me! 
 Thank you. 
 It really hurts! My neck! 
 Yeah, I bet it does. 
 It really hurts! 
 Shut up. 
 Detective Gonzalez, S.A.P.D. 
 You got anything I could feed my boss on Milo's condition? 
 Yeah. 
 It looks like a blunt trauma to the neck, zone 2. 
 From Dr. Callahan's struggle, right? 
 How did that go down? 
 He had a gun pointed at me. He was gonna take me with him. 
 T.C. stopped him. 
 Pretty ballsy guy to do that ... and a little reckless. 
 We were about to come in. 
 We didn't know you were out there. 
 What do you think? 
 I think T.C. did the right thing. 
 About this guy. 
 Right. Um... We need a scan to look for a carotid artery injury. 
 He may need a stent or surgical repair. 
 Exactly. So get a scan of his neck. 
 If it comes back positive, you put him in the queue for surgery. 
 But he has to wait. 
 [Scoffs] What? 
 Just to be clear, Doctor, Milo here is gonna be a key witness in a few other cases, so it's very important that you keep him alive. 
 We needed Dwayne alive. 
 We need Topher alive. And all of those people out there that did nothing but got themselves caught in an explosion? They need to be alive, too. So he can wait behind the rest of them. Milo : No. Is she really the only doctor? [Labored breathing] Ragosa : For those of you coming in to help, thank you very much. Thank you. Now I know you all are worried. Okay? But Topher, he was wounded and he's in surgery. And I'm very sad to inform you, but Dwayne... He was shot. He didn't make it. [Gasps] Again, this has been a brutal night, but it's not over. Let's say a prayer for Dwayne and Topher, and let's get back to what we have to do. We'll get through this together. Thank you. [Monitor beeping steadily] Jordan. You okay? I'm fine. We'll talk later. What do we got? Single G.S.W. to the abdomen. Pressure's borderline. F.A.S.T. scan revealed blood pooling behind his liver. I suspect an I.V.C. injury. [Monitor beeping erratically] Ox pressure's dropping. Scott : N... no time for a scan. He needs the O.R. T.C. : Yep. Jordan : Systolic is down to 40. He must be bleeding. Scott : Type and cross for 8 units. T.C. : Come on, Topher. Hang in there. We just gotta get the bullet out. Door. Scott, I'll be scrubbing in with you. [Woman speaking indistinctly over P.A.] Jordan : Somebody hit the elevator! What happened? Kenny : Everybody, move! Scott : Get the elevator door! Outta the way! Out... outta the way! Let's go! Move! [Murmuring] [Monitor beeping rapidly] Jocelyn : Pressure's down to 60. Scott : Still can't see what's bleeding. Little more retraction, please. Okay, I need you to place a running suture right beneath my clamp there. What a mess. [Silenced gunshots] [Rapid gunfire] [No audio] And, hey, Toph,  this son of a bitch here is my brother and platoon leader... Captain Thad Callahan. You forgot about tougher, cooler, better-looking, kicked your ass a million times... Placement's good. You can cut the suture now. T.C.! T.C.! Yeah? Suture. Yeah, I got it. I got it. [Whispers] Got it. Ragosa : We have to identify patients as soon as they've been admitted. If the patient is unresponsive when they come in, try to find some I.D. Or anything that could help identify them to loved ones. We're on it and we're cross-referencing with the other area hospitals. Perfect. Is there any word on Topher? He's still in surgery. I promise I'll make an announcement as soon as I hear anything. Thanks. I just checked in. Still touch and go. Hey, uh, shooter's scan came back positive. There's a small tear in the carotid. Are his vitals stable? For now. There's a hematoma plugging the hole. Um, I'll get him to the O.R. No. The O.R.s are full. So he's just gonna have to wait for interventional radiology for an endoscopic repair. Jordan? I know this is a difficult situation, but you have to treat him like every other patient. He's not like every other patient. I hired you as interim chief of staff because you're the kind of person that does the right thing. I know it's not easy, especially in this case, but it's the job. [Sighs deeply] Paul. Yeah? Do an O.R. setup. I'm gonna repair the artery myself. In the trauma room? Down here? The surgeons are swamped. I.R.'s gonna take forever. It's a temporary measure, but it will save his life. The hematoma isn't gonna be a band-aid for long. Okay. Thank you. [Woman speaks indistinctly over P.A.] [Monitor beeping steadily] Got it. Just missed the aorta. [Bullet clinks] All right, let's place another silk. Sponge stick, please. Repair is done. Time to remove this clamp. Moment of truth. Sutures are holding. [Exhales deeply] Field remaining dry. T.C., I can get him closed up here if you wanna take a break. I'm not going anywhere. I'm... I'm fine. Okay. Good. [Monitor beeping steadily] Drew : All right, we got her intubated. Now let's get her some relief. Let's start her on Q 15-minute dilaudid pushes, and she needs aggressive fluid resuscitation. Krista? You with me? [Sighs] Yeah. [Inhales deeply] Just with Topher the O.R... [Whispers] and Dwayne. I know it's terrible, and we all wanna be out there helping Topher, but we're in here. I don't wanna be a hard-ass, but you gotta focus. Okay. Okay. Gonzalez : How's he doing? He's gonna make it, right? Jordan : He's lost a lot of blood, but we're almost done. [Monitor beeping steadily] Release the proximal clamp. [Monitor beeping rapidly] Paul : Whoa. It's not holding. It's fine, Paul. It just... it needs an extra suture. Woman : Do you need help, Doctor? Should I call for Dr. Clemmens? Jordan : I got it, okay? Everybody just... Paul, watch what I do. Add another suture and tie it off. Now... Remove the clamp. See? It's all under control. [Monitor beeping steadily] When we're finished, feel free to put his cuffs back on. He'll be awake shortly and in a lot of pain. No skin off my nose. All right, look, I've done my job. Now you do yours. No deals. He goes to prison. Count on it. Reporting live from Selma, where a deadly fertilizer explosion has claimed the lives of at least two people and injured many more. Right now, emergency responders are still rescuing people from inside the building. Victims are being taken to a number of local hospitals, including San Antonio Memorial. All I've heard was that Topher just got out of surgery. There haven't been any complications so far, so... Okay. Thank you. Keep the updates coming. You got it. [Monitor beeping steadily] [Whispers] Toph? [Normal voice] Topher? [Grunts] Topher. [Exhales] [Strained voice] You're not gonna kiss me, are you? Just try and stop me. [Sniffles and sighs] [Exhales deeply] So... [Whispers] All things considered here... Yeah. Dwayne, man. Yeah. That's, uh... I can't believe it. That's gonna be a hard one to forget. How's Jordan? Shaken. She had to work on Milo. What? Carotid injury. You know, I wish... I wish I'd killed him. I wish you'd killed him before he shot me. I have three kids. That scared the crap out of me, man. I almost pissed myself. Yeah. [Sniffles] And then those flash bangs... it kind of took me back to the war, you know? Thad : Down! Down! [Rapid gunfire] You ever think about that sniper that shot Thad? [Rapid gunfire] Get a hemostatpin and try to clamp off the bleeder. Right. Right, right. I try not to think about anything about that day. Yeah. [Inhales sharply] Do you? Tee? It just keeps popping in my head. And I just... [Sighs] I just...  Tee. Tee? Tee! Yeah? Yeah? You just what? Just, uh... [Voice breaks] Oh, Topher! Hey. Toph! [Cries] It's okay. I'm okay. I'm okay. I don't understand. How... how did this happen? Topher will explain everything. You guys need to talk, Janet. He's gonna be fine. I took the bullet out myself. Toph, there's extra morphine in the P.C.A. machine. Wait. You just... you... you enjoy. Tee. [Sighs deeply] Tee! I just can't imagine the recovery process for something like this. There isn't one. When I was a medic in Iraq, an I.E.D. went off, killed three guys. This one guy survived, except the entire right side of his body was burned all the way down to the muscle. Lot of skin grafts, lot of plastic surgery, and a lot of pain. Oh, God. So let's just focus on making her comfortable and easing her pain. [Instruments clatter] One step at a time. [Telephone rings in distance] That was dispatch. There's been a secondary explosion at the factory. They're trying to triage there on site, but they're requesting help. We're already stretched too thin. I got it. I can go. Topher's fine. I just saw him. Spread the word, okay? Hey, Tee. Can we talk for a second? Yeah. Look, the only place that you should be going right now is home. You've been through a lot tonight. Yeah, so have you, but you're here. Is the shooter gonna make it? He's stable. Okay, don't change the subject. I'm fine. I've been through way worse. I'm just anxious to get out there. I don't wanna be late and have it on my hands. Okay? No, Tee... you have another day shifter coming in, you got plenty of people here to help you handle things, but you got no one out there who can do what I can do. You know that I'm right. Mollie, tell them I'm on my way. [Radio chatter] [Sighs] Drew. Can Krista handle the debriding without you? Yeah. She's got it down. There was another explosion at the factory. T.C. is on his way. I need you to go and keep an eye on him. He's just... [Sighs deeply] He's way too jacked up. You got it. Thank you. How you doing? I'm fine. I am. I'm fine. Jordan. Yeah? How you holding up? Just... focused on getting to the end of the shift. Why don't you go home? [Siren wailing] Would you? Scott, this is my E.R., okay? We're understaffed as it is. I'm staying. Okay. I just... I had to ask. I'm headed back to surgery. Can I borrow your intern Paul to to do a post-op eval on Topher? Might go better with a friendly face. Sure. I'll send him up when things slow down here. Great. Page me if you need me for anything. Man : Come on! We got another burn victim coming in! I will. I love you. I love you, too. [Siren wailing] Tee, you ready? Let's go. Tee! Tee, we gotta go. [Door bangs open] T.C., come on! We gotta go. [Horn honks] Man : Let's go! The truck's ready! Are you okay? Yeah. Yeah. I'm going with ya. Just figured I could use the excitement. Come on. Man : Let's go, Doctors! We don't have all night! [Shouts indistinctly] [Sirens wailing] Man : Grab an extra c-collar! Okay, lift it. Does it hurt? [Grunts] Ah! How about that? Okay, here we go. Man : [Speaks indistinctly] Get the less severe injuries off to University Hospital. Make sure to label before you ship. Take a marker and write their conditions and their vitals on their right arm. The more severe injuries are to be stabilized here before being transported. Okay, this guy's ready. Clean him up, get him to the hospital. Doctors, we got a woman in there. She's pinned under a beam. My guys are trying to get her out, but they're afraid she's taken a lot of smoke and her breathing's labored. 2-man job. Yeah. Okay, take us to her. Okay, you'll be masked. I'm warning ya... you've got about five minutes before this thing starts coming down. I think we can handle it. Man : [Shouts indistinctly] [Clink] [Groans] It hurts really bad! [Flinches] I need something for the pain! Mm. That's too bad. [Gasping] And, you know, it's probably just gonna get worse. [Inhales sharply] Please! I get it. You hate me. [Rails rattle] You get it?! Ow! You murdered a man. [Breathing heavily] You were probably gonna kill me, and you almost killed one of my friends. The only reason... [instruments clatter] That I fixed you up is because it's my job. I hope that you live to be 100 years old and you spend every day of it rotting in prison, because that is what you deserve. Ow. [Breathing heavily] So, no. Nope, you don't get any pain medication. [Sputters] You can lie here and suffer for all I care. [Breathing heavily] How's he doing? He's fine. [Handcuff clinks] Oh, come on! We just had our fourth victim pass away from the accident tonight. File says Joshua Gomez. Oh, my God. I just spoke with his mother. [Inhales deeply] I hate this. It's like you never get to tell them any good news. I'll do it with you. [Siren wailing] Okay. Woman on TV :... Which puts the number of fatalities at eight right now. Still dozens more injured and being treated. Victims are being identified... Ms. Gomez? You can check the web site or call the hotline number... I'm afraid I have some bad news. Your son Joshua, he... he suffered severe trauma from the explosion, and he died. [Voice breaks] No. [Inhales sharply] I'm so sorry. [Sobbing] No! No! [Continues sobbing] Man : [Muffled voice] She's over here! [Metal creaks and groans] She's trapped under the debris. She's having trouble breathing. She can't get any oxygen from the mask. Man : Over here! T.C. : [Speaks indistinctly] Ah! [Helmet thuds] Her airway's almost closed shut from the swelling. This oxygen ain't doing crap. Hey, Drew, we need to do a crike. [Coughs] Prep her neck. [Coughs] [Filtered voice] You gotta put the mask back on. I can't see a thing through that mask. [Exhales sharply and coughs] [Man shouts in distance] [Metal groans] Man : We have to get everyone out of here, Doc! [Metal groans] Man : Let's go! Come on! The structure's unstable! It's going to shift! You in? [Coughs] Okay. I'm in. I'm in. Okay, let's go! 
 
 [Whirring] [Rumbling] [Explosion] Drew : Tee! T.C., we done here? We gotta go! They're talking about a possible gas leak. Let's go! Come on. Yeah. Let's go. [Siren wails] [Monitor beeping steadily] Aah! What the hell are you doing? I was just, uh... Well, Dr. Clemmens told me to put in the catheter. [Hoarse voice] Told you, or told you to tell a nurse? Uh, told me to tell a nurse. I... I just... thought... You know. [Chuckles nervously] Have... have you ever done one of these before? Sure. Yeah. On... on... on a... on a cadaver. Well, you're not doing one on me. Did you want me to grab a... a nurse or... No need. There is no way I'm getting a catheter. It's not gonna happen, so... On your way. Shoo. Shoo. Uh... Keep going. Out. [Inhales sharply, exhales deeply] Drew : Let me check her tube, make sure it's secure before we transport her. Tee, you wanna... Tee? Get her to the rig. Tee! [Fire whooshes, metal clanks] Tee! [Metal creaks] Tee! Tee, where are you?! [Metal groans] Tee, we've gotta get outta here now! Tee! [Sirens wailing] Drew : Tee, what the hell are you doing?! I heard somebody yell. Where? I thought I heard someone. I gotta find them! Tee, the building's clear! I gotta get in there! No one's here! [Grunts] It's gonna collapse! We gotta get outta here! Okay. Come on! Yeah. Yeah. Let's go! [Siren wails] [Monitor beeping rapidly] Her o2 is dropping. She's not moving any air. Jordan! What's going on in there, Krista? The burnt skin around her chest and abdomen is too tight. She can't expand her lungs. She's gonna suffocate. She needs an escharotomy. Jordan and Kenny : Clear. [Paddles thunk] I have my hands full here. You're gonna have to do it. Have you ever done one before? I've seen videos. Okay, make an incision through the chest wall. It'll allow the soft tissue to expand so that she can breathe easier. Go assist her. Got it. Clear. [Paddles thunk] [Monitor beeping rapidly] All right, you can go. Woman : Clear. Krista, I've seen you do some pretty badass things since you've been here. For God sakes, you pulled a fork out a girl's throat tonight. Woman : [Gasping] Yeah. Jordan : Push another epi. You got this. Heather : She's ready now, Doctor. Right up. Jordan : Charging. Woman : [Continues gasping] Jordan : Clear! [Inhales deeply] It's working. She's breathing. Heather : Her o2 is rising. Oh, God, it's... it's really working. Nice job, Krista. [Monitor beeping steadily] Thanks, Kenny. Mm. Never had a doubt. [Whispers] Oh. Now we'll just have to I.D. her. [Radio chatter] Excuse me. Can you help me? Are you here to see a doctor or are you looking for... My wife Susan. She was working at the factory in Selma tonight. I've been trying to call her on her cell phone since the accident. I went to University, and they said to check here. Okay. Let's get some information. [Voice breaks] She's gotta be okay. It's all my fault. How? I always bring her her lunch mid-shift, but I was late tonight, and she should've been in the parking lot with me. Okay. Why don't you just give me your name? Yeah. Max Leonard. The one night I'm late... Is there anything that you can tell me about your wife that might help us track her down? Uh, she's about 5'5". Blonde hair, blue eyes. Let's see, what else? Uh, she's got a little green fairy tattooed on the inside of her wrist. I told her it was silly, but she loves "Moulin Rouge!" It's okay. Why don't you have a seat in the waiting room? And I will come find you as soon as I know something. Oh, thank you. Thank you. Thank you. [Woman over P.A.] Paging Dr. de la Cruz to Patient Services. Dr. de la Cruz to Patient Services. [Monitor beeping steadily] Thanks. [Sighs] I said no catheter. I spoke to Scott, and he says that if you can urinate, you don't need one. Tell Scott if he wants a catheter so damn bad, he can stick up his own pen1s. I... I can't tell him that. Just give me the bottle and leave. Actually, um, he's gonna want proof. I kinda... have to stay. I cannot do it with you watching. Step outside or something. Yeah, if I leave, you're just gonna lie about it, and... How will I lie? There will be no urine in the bottle. Oh. Mm-hmm. Can you get me some water? But are... are you sure that's a... a good idea? Are you telling me what to do? No. I... I wasn't, uh, t... actually, yes. I'm the doctor, and you're the patient. Oh. N... normally, And if you get backed up, you develop urosepsis or renal failure. So I'm gonna grab you a glass of water. Now if it does not work, I'm getting a nurse to put in the catheter. Okay, Doctor. You make an excellent point. That's exactly how I would've said it. Can you get me some water, please? Yes, sir. [Faucet running] Did you want me to leave the water running? Sometimes that helps when I can't go. I guess... just makes it happen. Did not need that visual. [Telephone rings, siren wailing] Dr. Clemmens. Hey, I just, um... I wanted to thank you again for getting me in to see Dr. Clodfelter. Glad to do it. He's the best ocular surgeon I know. He ran some tests on me. Says they'll probably be able to get me in for the eye surgery next month. Oh, that's great news, Michael. I know this trouble with your vision has been a burden on you. Yeah. Anyway, I'm back up to the O.R. All right. [Siren continues wailing] [Intercom beeps] Dr. de la Cruz? You're trying to match patients to family members, right? Yeah. Do you have something? This I.D. was with the woman in Trauma 3. She's very badly burned. It was in her jacket. I just found it. [Intercom beeps] Woman over P.A. : All available surgical interns, please report to the O.R. All available surgical interns, please report... [Voice breaks] Oh, my God. Susan. [Inhales sharply] I'm so sorry. We found her name tag with her jacket. She's intubated, so she won't be able to talk. Is she in pain? She's heavily medicated. Can I touch her? Yes, but just try to be gentle. Max : [Cries] [Breathing heavily] Oh, my God. Susan. S... oh, Susan. [Siren wailing, bag hissing] That was a great incision you made, considering you were half-blind. [Siren wailing] Topher : T.C., you want me to take a turn there? I can step in for you. No. I got it. [Bag continues hissing] I'm sorry, man. You did everything you could. [Lowered voice] I thought the captain was dead. [Lowered voice] His brain is gone, but he's pumping to keep the heart working so we can transplant it into Nick. Dude, why won't you answer my question? Why? Tee! [Gasps] Tee? Tee! Yeah? What? You okay? Yeah. Yeah. [Inhales deeply] We almost there? Yeah. We're five minutes out. [Bag continues hissing] Okay. What's going on? Nothing. Nothing at all. So tell me, how are you doing? I just keep telling me I'm fine because I want to be fine. But I'm having a really hard time focusing and I can't get it out of my head. The last thing you should do is get it out of your head. What you need to do is talk about it and deal with it. But honestly, after tonight, you shouldn't even be here. I have to be here. I can't just leave. Everyone that I care about, they're here. And none of those people would be judging you, Jordan. Well, I would judge me. Honestly, I'm judging myself about T.C. right now. About what? You know, until I was in that room tonight,  with my life on the line... I had no idea what T.C. went through in that war. I thought I knew. I thought I understood. But I was frustrated with him, with his anger and his anxiety and his depression. And I... I didn't think that it was ever going to end. But if I feel this way after 15 minutes of hell... What does he feel like after 15 months? I tried to talk to him about it before, but he wouldn't go there. He never does. [Door opens] Jordan, could you take a look at the woman in Trauma 3? Her oxygen levels just won't come up. And I... [Inhales deeply] tried to make her as comfortable as possible, but... Terrible way to go. Is her husband with her? Yeah. I'll talk to him. Thank you. All right, let's go. Thanks. [Monitor beeping steadily] Mr. Leonard, I'm so sorry. All we can do is just help with the pain. [Inhales sharply] I know. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. I... really, really hate this part of the job. Don't ever lose that. Dr. Alexander. Yeah? It's the shooter. They need you. Okay. Look, keep her comfortable. Yeah. [Monitor beeping steadily] [Flatlining] This is pointless. Most of his blood's already on the floor. I'm calling it. [Sighs deeply] 4:02 A.M. Got it. 4:02. [Machine beeps] He's dead? Why? Carotid artery burst open. This man needed to be in I.R. for a stent or in the O.R. with me. The sutures tore. The hole needed to be repaired with a dacron patch. What happened? Who dropped the ball on this? He was my patient. But the field was completely dry when I closed him up. I double-checked. You said he was stable. He was. Look, Scott, you were in the O.R., and I didn't think he was stable enough to wait for I.R. So in other words, you screwed up. Captain. He didn't make it. Yeah, the lady doctor that was in there with him did the operation. I'm sorry about that, but he should've been brought up to surgery. Look, you guys were swamped upstairs, Scott. I... I made a tough call. Well, it was the wrong one. Look... [Exhales deeply] I know this has been a hell of a night for you, but unless someone is crashing right in front of you, surgery needs to happen in the O.R. Just have someone get me. I'll come right down for you. Jordan. Yeah? You got a second? Can I... [Telephone rings in distance] He's off. What happened? I mean, I wish I was wrong, but I figured you sent me out there for a reason. Yeah. Okay, tell me everything. I've never seen him like this before, but I've seen others like this. After the war, he's jumpy, he's sweaty, he's... he said he heard a voice. He said that? He could have, okay? We were in a building. It was chaos. He might've heard one. [Whispers] Okay. I don't think so. I should've made him go home. Well, we both know that's easier said than done. I tried to get him to let me have the patient. Pretty basic, open book pelvis fracture. He wasn't having any of it. He insisted on doing it himself. Okay, I'm gonna try and talk to him. But, Drew, could you please just stand by? He... he's in Trauma 2. Thank you. Dr. Alexander. Yeah? I need you to tell me what happened. I'm sorry, but this is just not a good time. Yeah, but you told me he was fine, and then I told my boss he was fine, and now the guy is dead. I need to know why. This is a major case. She said it wasn't a good time, Detective. Doctor, do what you need to do. [Lowered voice] Now listen, you can talk to her after her shift, okay? Or even better, maybe tomorrow. She's been through a lot. The other doctor said it was a screwup. Was it? Or maybe she wasn't trying as hard as she could? You bet your ass I'm gonna find out. Hey, give me a T-pod to stabilize her pelvis. How's it going? It's good. Is it? Yeah. [Woman speaking indistinctly over P.A.] Tee, I want you to step down and let me finish this. No, I'm fine. You are not fine. You are not yourself. I've seen you like this before. Tee, please. Let me help you. Do it for me. [Exhales deeply] Yeah. Okay. Yeah. I should go check on Topher. Yeah. That's a good idea. I'll be up soon. [Indistinct conversations] Everything okay? Yeah. Yeah, he's fine. He just, uh... he needed to take a break, that's all. Finally someone got through to him. Oh, just so you know, that detective's on a rampage about what happened, Jordan. It's not a priority right now. Oh, it will be. I need to protect you on this one. Gonna set you up with our lawyer. This isn't going away. Is that a fairy? We get a name on this patient? I don't know. Ask Drew. [Camera shutter clicks] [Telephone rings, indistinct conversations] Landry? Earlier this evening, you were talking to a man who mentioned something about a tattoo on someone's wrist. That was Max Leonard. We already found his wife Susan. She's in 3. I had to do an escharotomy on her. She's not gonna make it. I just broke the news to her husband. Jordan is working on someone who has a green fairy tattoo on her wrist. What? I don't understand. There was a name tag. Yeah. I... I found it. It was in her jacket. Well, maybe she borrowed the jacket. I don't know. Mr. Leonard? Do you have a picture of your wife? What? Why? On your phone or something? I don't understand. Why would you want a picture? I have to show you something. ♪ Oh, my God! [Voice breaks] Susan! [Chuckles] I... I thought you were... But you're okay! [Mouths words] You're okay. Oh! Oh, my God! Wow. Yeah. I love you so much. [X-ray rustles] Unbelievable, huh? Yeah. But then, uh, who's that poor woman who was burned? And who does she belong to? Krista, let's see if we can match her to any of the other reports. Yeah. [Cell phone rings, beeps] Ah. Dr. Clodfelter. You're up early. Yes. Yes, yes, I have a minute. Man : ♪ goin' home ♪ [blows air] [Sighs] Tee! Why didn't you... Tee! Tee! [Gunfire] [Water continues running] Thad : Why? [Gunfire] [Punching] Hmm. [Liquid trickling] Finally.

Dr. Clemmens right now! [Gasping] Uh, give me T.C. give me Jordan. Anybody, okay? Woman : Right away, Doctor. I'll go page him. Woman : His blood pressure's dropping. [Monitor beeping steadily] Scott : We have to stop the bleeding. More suction, please. What happened? Scott : Epidural hematoma. Bullet must've ricocheted off his spine, and blood is compressing his spinal cord if we don't relieve the bleeding, he could become paralyzed or worse. He can't die. We need to evacuate all of this blood here. Kenny : Gotcha. He can't die. T.C., you okay? Thad : Tee, save me. Thad, you gotta stay with me, man. We gotta stop the bleeding. You gotta stop the bleeding! Kenny! [Shouting indistinctly] Scott : Get him outta here! We can't leave him! T.C.! Tee! [Shouts indistinctly] Get him outta here! T.C., stop. [Shouts indistinctly] Drew : It's all right. Calm down. Calm down! It's all right. Get off me! It's us! Jordan, step in. I need you to assist. T.C. : Don't leave me! Man : Let's get him out of here. Kenny : It's cool, T.C. Jordan! Drew, T.C., and Kenny : [Speak indistinctly] Guy's a frickin' nut job, and he's gonna drag you and everyone else here down with him if you're not careful. Let's just focus on saving Topher right now, okay? [Monitor beeping steadily] [Siren wailing] I just checked on Topher. [Door closes] No news yet. And then they told me about the whole thing with T.C. Were you there? What? T.C. Do you know if he's okay? I... I... I don't know. Is everything okay? I just got a call from, um, Dr. Clodfelter. The eye surgeon. So what did he say? It's a little more complicated than we thought. I, uh... I have a tumor behind my eye. Oh, Michael. I'm so sorry. It's a hell of a night, huh?

No, Topher's gonna be okay. It was not your fault. You did what anyone would do in that situation. That's not what I'm talking about. Okay. I keep having these... memories, dreams, whatever you wanna call them. What about? About when Thad... [inhales deeply] .. was... was killed. I keep seeing him get shot over and over. I keep reliving that moment. That's what I'm talking about. That's what was my fault. No. Yeah. All right, we'll take the front. You take the back entrance. Watch your six. Yeah. [Door creaks] I hesitated. Why didn't you shoot? Why? The sniper,  he was a kid. He was maybe 12 years old. Maybe. [Door creaks] He was a kid, Jordan. Uhh! Thad! So I hesitated...
