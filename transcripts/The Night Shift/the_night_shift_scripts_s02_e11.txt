 So he still has the bike? 
 He promises weekends only, and then on Friday, he rides it to work. 
 He says that's the start of the weekend. 
 [Chuckles] So you get pregnant, he goes back to being an adrenaline junkie. 
 Yeah, that's who he is, which is frustrating because he's obviously happy. 
 What is this, 1950? Clearly,  you're  not happy. 
 Bozo went B.A.S.E. Jumping two weekends ago. 
 Okay, he went parasailing strapped to the back of A.T.V. 
 I mean, really, who does that? 
 So tell him to stop. 
 I can't do that. 
 He loves that stuff. I mean... [offs] 
 He will resent me. 
 And I know I would resent him if he tried to change me. 
 But you're not risking your life. 
 He has to be more responsible to you, right? 
 I agree. But... Man that I fell in love with, you know? 
 It's what made him different from the other guys I was dating. 
 Which is fine if you are  dating,  but now he's gonna be a father. 
 I think there... there has to be a middle ground, huh? 
 Yeah. We're still trying to find it. 
 We're on it. 
 Gwen, M.V.A. in Prospect Hill. 
 Auto versus auto sounds bad. 
 Okay, I'm on it. See ya. Catch you later. 
 Hey, what are you doing here? Isn't it your night off? 
 Yeah. I wanna go on a ride-along with you. 
 [Laughs] No. I'm serious. 
 Look, I already got Topher's permission. 
 I just need yours now. 
 Why do you wanna do this? 
 'Cause I'm the new charge nurse, but I don't feel much in charge yet. 
 I wanna experience what happens to the patients before they come to us. 
 [Chuckles] 
 Careful what you wish for. It can get crazy out there. 
 Anything goes down, I'll be there to protect you. 
 Oh, honey, I've seen things that'll make you wet your pants. 
 I'm ready for anything. 
 Just make sure you don't slow me down. 
 All right? Get in there. 
 Ha ha! Yes! 
 [Laughs]

 We got one female with a leg laceration. Right over there. 
 Shane! Shane! 
 Drew : Hey. 
 Oh, my God! 
 Okay. 
 Shane! Uh, y-you have to go help my boyfriend. 
 He's trapped under there. 
 The thing came crashing down on him. 
 Drew : All right, just take it... just calm down. 
 Let me take a look at this. 
 Shane? 
 Just be patient, please. Everything's gonna be okay. 
 Okay. 
 What's your name? 
 M-my name's Lindsay. 
 [Gasps] 
 All right, Lindsay, anything else hurt? 
 No, just my leg. 
 Okay. 
 [Electricity crackles] 
 [Groaning] 
 Oh, Lordy. You see that ride? 
 [Metal creaks] 
 You saw that ride, didn't you? Oh, man! [Grunts] 
 You've been impaled. Don't move. 
 Oh, well, so I have. 
 Yeah. 
 I'm Shane McCoy. 
 Yeah? 
 Yeah. You seen me ride out there, didn't you? 
 Okay, hold still. Okay? 
 It was a shame the way it ended, though. 
 I could've ridden that bull till sunset, you know. 
 Okay, okay. I-I need you to stop talking, okay? 
 I'd-a had my 8 seconds, too. 
 You lost a lot of blood. Your heart is racing. 
 Yeah. 
 I'm gonna push this off you.

 Whoa, ho! 
 What a rush, huh? 
 [Laughs] What a rush! What a rush! 
 That's bull ridin', son. 
 [Exhales sharply] 
 Yeah. [Panting] 
 Never felt so alive. 
 That was something. 
 Yeah! 
 Tee! [Groans] 
 Holy... close call. 
 Just... Be careful. 
 High time we got this started. Thank you. 
 Hey, Topher. 
 Oh. Hey. 
 Um, I just wanted to make sure that you got my application for my second year... 
 Chief resident track. Got yours and Paul's. 
 Too bad there's only one slot for the two of you. 
 Ragosa : Aah! Aah! 
 [Paul and Jordan laugh] 
 What's this all about? 
 Oh, Ragosa's taking his medical boards next week... 
 Ragosa : Warn me first! 
 And they hooked him up to a neurostimulator to quiz him. 
 Savages. 
 No, it's his idea. 
 He wanted the motivation. 
 Jordan : You wanna be a big swinging doctor, you gotta handle the pressure. 
 Aah! Let's do this! 
 Okay, okay. Um, 10 causes of pancreatitis. Go! 
 Gallstones, ethanol, trauma, drugs, mumps... 
 Faster! 
 Mumps... aah! 
 [Zaps] 
 [Laughter] 
 Uh... Steroids, autoimmune, hyperlipids aah! 
 [Zaps] 
 Hey, I was right! 
 Sorry, I slipped. 
 Ohh. 
 [Telephone rings] 
 Idiopathic... 
 You got that look in your eyes. Don't do it. 
 No. No, don't do it! 
 [Grunts] Ow! 
 [Zaps] 
 [Groans] You had it on high, didn't you? 
 Hey, Topher? 
 Jordan : Scorpion stings. 
 Ragosa : I knew that. 
 Yeah? 
 Okay, next one. 
 [Exhales deeply] 
 Okay, thanks. 
 Okay, people! Fun's over. 
 Multiple trauma coming in from the rodeo. Let's be ready. 
 All right, I'll take incoming in trauma 4. 
 Ragosa, Mollie, get rooms ready! 
 Ready on high. 
 Double-time, people! Let's go! 
 [Siren wailing] 
 Man : Hey, did you see that? 
 Hey! 
 Arrest him! 
 Hey, what are you doing? 
 Gwen : Paramedic coming through! Make a way. 
 Make a way. Back up, please. Make a path. Make a path. 
 Man : What are you doing? 
 Get off of him. Everybody, please, step back! 
 Give us some room here! 
 Man : I'm not gonna tell you again. Get off my son! 
 Where's the driver? 
 Here's over here! Hurry! Move! 
 I'm not gonna tell you again before I kick your ass! 
 I'm gonna need you to step back. 
 He's the one who hit my boy! He was the driver! 
 Calm down. Calm down. 
 Sir, I'm a paramedic. 
 I'm gonna need you to step aside, okay? 
 Man : Step back. 
 Kenny : Hey, buddy, come on. Let her work. Let her work. 
 Sir, I'm not gonna tell you twice! 
 Scott? 
 ♪♪♪ 
 Man : Did you see that?! 
 Man : So messed up! 
 He's barely breathing. 
 Dr. Scott, you are bleeding. 
 And we gotta get him out of here now! 
 [Gwen speaks indistinctly] 
 Man : Look, I'm not gonna tell you again! 
 Take your hands off my boy! 
 [Man speaks indistinctly] 
 Get that under control, all right?! Calm down. 
 What are you doing? That man should be in jail! 
 Calm down. 
 Hey, look, man! 
 Hey, Kenny! Kenny! Kenny! I got this. 
 Listen to me carefully, 'cause I'm only gonna say this once. 
 That man is a doctor. You want your son to live? 
 Okay. One... 
 You let us work, let us get to the hospital. 
 Two... Three! 
 It is that simple. Is that clear? 
 [Scott speaks indistinctly] 
 He hit my boy. 
 And now he's trying to help. 
 Okay? 
 Hey, I'm gonna need a statement from the driver. 
 Can it wait for the hospital? 
 Scott : Let's go! Let's go! 
 Clear a path! 
 Let's go! 
 Gwen : Ready? 
 All right, step back. 
 One... Two... Three. 
 Man : What are you doing? 
 Man : Send his ass to jail! 
 Watch the equipment.

 I gotta go with my boy! 
 Coming through! 
 T.C. : All right, people, let's move! 
 Male, 40s, sever puncture wounds to the lower flanks, severe bleeding, possible brain trauma. 
 Man's a champ! Saved my ... 
 Yeah, sit back, sir. 
 Okay, hang 2 units of O-neg and send off a trauma panel. 
 Mollie, bring him to trauma 4 and notify C.T. 
 Shane? How is he? 
 Drew : Yeah, still talking. 
 Female, 40s, deep leg lac, stable. 
 Hey, nice work, Drew. Curtain 1. Let's get Shane taken care of. 
 Someone's feeling energetic. 
 Yeah, you know, you're out in the field, you're always up, right? 
 Tee, I'm sorry to pull you off your case. 
 I need you on incoming. 
 Okay. 
 Okay, Jordan, you're with Drew on the cowboy. 
 Got it. 
 Catch you later, Jordan. 
 Hey, enjoy that rodeo Vic. He's a real piece of work. 
 What's up? Scott got in an accident. 
 I need you to step in. 
 Gwen : Male, 20s, blunt chest trauma from M.V.A., tachy and hypotensive. 
 Flail chest, probable hemothorax. 
 Trauma for a chest tube, then up to the O.R. 
 Okay, Tee, go. 
 No, no, no! This is my patient! 
 No, I'm... 
 Wait, Scott! Scott! The police called. 
 You were  in  that accident. 
 Yes, I was, but I'm fine. Topher, I'm fine. 
 Okay, well, you're gonna have to answer some questions. 
 I mean, they need you to take a drug test. 
 What happened out there? 
 I-I don't can we talk about it later? 
 No. Okay, fine, but there's no way I can let you work on that kid. 
 Look, there's no time for this! 
 The kid needs me in there right now! 
 Well, not until we check you out. 
 We gotta make sure there's no brain trauma. 
 My name is Scott Clemmens. 
 Z, y, x, w, v, u, t. 
 Scott... 
 It is Tuesday night at 8:30 P.M. 
 That boy's blood pressure is 82 over 42 and falling fast. 
 Okay. 
 I am the on-call surgeon, and if you don't let me in there right now to drain the blood from his chest, he's gonna die. 
 Okay, look, T.C. can get it started. 
 We can call around for another thoracic surgeon. 
 Oh, come on! Just... [huffs] 
 Do the neuro, clear me, and let me get into surgery. 
 Scott, even if... 
 The... the family has called the hospital. 
 They don't want you anywhere near their son. 
 I'm sorry, you're gonna have to sit this one out. 
 Well, actually, you know, it's not as dangerous as people think it is. 
 Drew : Bandage, please. 
 Ain't no rules, no nothing. 
 You know oh! 
 You're hotter than a summer revival. 
 Amen. 
 Easy there, cowboy. She's already spoken for. 
 Man's gotta speak his mind. 
 Hey, you better speak it quieter. 
 Your girlfriend's in the next room. 
 Yeah. How is she? 
 She's good. 
 All right. 
 I sutured the wound, but he's still tachy. 
 Blood infusion could help. What about his X-rays? 
 Uh, they're right over there. They look normal to me. 
 Okay. 
 Where's Dr. Superman at? 
 I need to give him a hug. 
 I'd be feedin' the worms if he hadn't come along. 
 Talking about T.C. 
 Oh, boy, talk about cojones. He nearly gave up the ghost. 
 I'm sorry. What? 
 You know, died. 
 This giant silver thingamabob, sharper than a spur, it came down about this close to his neck. 
 Is that true? 
 I guess. I don't know. I mean, I was... came in from a bad angle. 
 Drew. 
 Bad angle? What are you talking about? 
 This thing, it would've cut his head, I swear to God. All right! 
 [Muffled speaking] Come down and punctured him! It was right there! 
 Sir, just breathe deep. 
 Drew? 
 Blood would've been everywhere. I was sittin' right next to him. 
 Does this hurt? 
 Mnh-mnh. 
 All right, what about here? 
 Mnh-mnh. 
 [Inhales sharply] Ow! 
 How long have you had this pain? 
 A-about a week. [Sighs deeply] 
 At first, I thought it was just cramps, but then I got a fever. 
 [Monitor beeping steadily] 
 Uh, where are your parents? We need their consent for tests. 
 My dad's driving in from Dallas. He had to go there for work. 
 But you can reach him on his cell. 
 Does this mean I'm gonna have to miss volleyball? 
 I gotta get my practice time. 
 Uh, what are you in? Eighth grade? 
 Ninth grade. I'm a freshman. 
 I play J.V., but I'm first alternate on varsity. 
 Wow. Is that how you, uh, sprained your wrist? 
 No. Carpal tunnel. 
 My dad says I text too much. 
 I-I see you had your appendix taken out. 
 [Inhales sharply] Yeah, right here. 
 Still kinda hurts. 
 Uh, do you remember who your surgeon was? 
 Dr. Bell-Hart. 
 Krista, hold on for a sec. 
 Hey. 
 Hey, I'm doing a surgical consult on Catherine Redding. 
 Uh, she was your... 
 My appy patient. 
 Yeah. She's a sweet girl. What's she in for? 
 Abdominal pain and fever. It could be post-op complications. 
 Who was your attending? It was Joey, but he let me drive the whole way. 
 So you counted lap pads? Irrigated before closing? 
 You think I screwed up? 
 You know it could've been any number of things. 
 I mean, did you even check? 
 Of course. I'm still ordering a C.T. just to be safe. 
 She's 14 years old, and you're about to give her more radiation? 
 Okay, uh... We'll do an ultrasound and run labs. 
 But you better be right, because if something else happens to her, this will be on you. 
 [Monitor beeping steadily] 
 How's he doing? 
 Touch and go. 
 We stabilized him for surgery. 
 I heard Scott plowed into him. Is that true? 
 Scott doesn't know how it happened. 
 The police are on their way. They wanna talk to him. 
 Oh, that's never good. 
 Hope for his sake he wasn't responsible. 
 Pulse ox is down to 80. 
 Okay. [Sighs] 
 Second tube is in. 
 [Monitor beeping rapidly] Whoa! Geez! 
 He's gonna bleed out. Give me gloves. 
 I'm losing his pulse. 
 Heart rate's up to 170. 
 I'm cracking his chest. 
 [defibrillator whines, monitor emits continuous sound] 
 Aorta is clamped. Paddles. 
 Clear. 
 [Paddles thunk] 
 Still nothing. 
 Increase to 30 Joules. 
 Okay. 
 [Defibrillator whines] 
 Ready? Clear. 
 [Paddles thunk] 
 [Monitor beeping steadily] 
 It's beating. That was close. 
 Pulse is strong. 
 Let's pack him, get him up to surgery. 
 You want me to scrub in? 
 No, I can get started. 
 All right, now most of all, I need you to convince the dad to let Scott up there. 
 All right. 
 Let me get into it. All right. 
 [Monitor continues beeping steadily] 
 All right. 
 Now we gave him something for the pain. 
 Okay? 
 [Rail clatters] 
 This is for you. Okay. 
 [Monitor beeping steadily] 
 The quietest I've ever seen him. 
 How's he doin'? 
 Well, his hip is healing fine, but we're having trouble getting his heart rate down. 
 Did he have a history with drugs? Alcohol? 
 Oh. Yeah, he used to drink a ton. 
 It's the one thing about him that I fixed. 
 Well, he is quite the character. 
 Ooh, he talks a lot and flirts, skirts death on a daily basis. 
 He's been that way since I've known him. 
 Yeah? Does he still ride bulls? 
 Oh. No, not on the rodeo circuit. They made him quit. 
 So what does he do in the rodeo? 
 Nearly gets himself killed. 
 Steer wrestlin', barrel racin'. 
 The crowd loves it. We're a team. 
 I'm retired, but now I call out the acts, and he does his thing. 
 And you're okay with that? 
 If you take that away, he wouldn't be the man I fell in love with, would he? 
 Oh, he'd be dead inside without it. 
 How long have you two been together? 
 Oh, my goodness. [Chuckles] 
 Too long, I suppose. 
 Oh, we don't have any rings. 
 We never thought to make it official. 
 No kids, though we did talk about it from time to time. 
 Seems like a... Sweet guy. 
 I'm sure he would've been a great dad. 
 Yeah, his heart's in the right place. 
 He just never was daddy material. 
 You know, I'm not the smartest woman in the world, but I wasn't dumb enough to get knocked up by a man who couldn't think past his next bull ride. 
 Okay. 
 [Chuckles] 
 E-excuse me. 
 [Monitor continues beeping steadily] 
 Drew : You almost died out there. 
 Yeah. It was really something, huh? [Scrubbing] 
 I haven't felt that way since, uh... 
 Yeah, getting shot at and missed. It's great. 
 [Laughs] 
 Kinda makes you see everything in a whole new light. 
 Yeah? So what are you seeing? 
 [Inhales deeply] Aw, you know, just how confused I am. 
 You know, my... my life's changing so much. 
 [Chuckles] I feel bad for Jordan. 
 You know, I just... I feel stupid for... for holding back, for not going all in. 
 Oh, no, no. You went all in. You got her pregnant. 
 Yeah. [Laughs] 
 Yeah, but she needs more than that from me. 
 You know, I thought I'd be okay by now, but after... 
 [Inhales deeply] Breakdown in group and... 
 [Exhales deeply] 
 Look, having a baby is... is great. 
 It's exciting. I'm excited. 
 But? 
 It just feels like I have to get things together faster. 
 I mean, I have to I have to be able to fix things in my head quicker than if we weren't having a kid, you know? 
 Yeah. 
 Lot of added pressure. [Exhales deeply] 
 Yeah? And what does Jordan have to say? 
 I haven't told her. 
 Why? 
 W-why? [Scoffs] 
 Because I'm... [chuckles] I don't know what to say. 
 You know, it's all kinda swirling around in my head. 
 And... [inhales deeply] 
 You know, I don't wanna hurt her. 
 I don't want her to feel like it's anything to do with her, 
 'cause it's not. It's all me. 
 But not telling her's worse. 
 Uh... 
 Dr. Callahan, the patient's ready now. 
 All right. [Whispers] Patient's ready. 
 Lucky you. 
 Mm-hmm. 
 Yeah. 
 I got witnesses he hit my boy. Now you're telling me... 
 I understand. 
 I-I know this is hard, Mr. Johnson. 
 That he's the best man for this job? 
 You don't know nothin'! What you talking about? 
 Look, Dr. Clemmens... is our most qualified surgeon, especially with this... 
 Scott : Mr. Johnson? 
 Type of... Scott, this is not a good time. 
 What the hell are you doing here? 
 Take another step closer! 
 Please! If you want your boy to live, you'll let me do this operation. 
 You're not touching my boy. 
 Just let me say my piece, please. 
 Sir, Malik's lung is badly injured, and several ribs are detached from his chest. 
 We need to repair the lung and put his chest wall back together. 
 No one can do that like I can. 
 Believe me, Mr. Johnson, there is nobody in this hospital... nobody wants your boy to live more than I do. 
 Oh, is that right? 
 More than me? More than his family? 
 No, what I meant... 
 I know what you meant! 
 You meant that you're guilty. You hit him. 
 So you go in there and you better go fix my boy. 
 That's right, 'cause if you don't, I'm gonna sue you, and I'm gonna see your ass rot in jail. 
 Okay, we'll fix it. 
 Okay, go scrub in for surgery. I'll call legal. 
 Yeah. 
 Don't say nothin' to me! Don't say nothin' to me. 
 [Ultrasound whooshing] 
 [Monitor beeping steadily] 
 [Lowered voice] All right. 
 No sign of gallstones. Could be viral. 
 [Lowered voice] Or a drug-resistant peritonitis. 
 Did you sterilize your instruments? 
 No, I spat on them Paul. What do you think? 
 I think there's a giant neon sign on this girl that says mistakes were made during surgery. 
 Oh, a few weeks into your rotation, you're suddenly the expert on surgical mistakes. 
 You're not your dad. 
 Gee, thank you for the reminder. 
 You know, maybe if you focused more on surgery a little bit more than Joey's ass, this girl wouldn't be back in here. 
 You don't... 
 [whispers] Whoa, whoa, whoa. I get this crap at home. 
 I don't need it here. What the hell's going on? 
 We were just... disagreeing on the differential. 
 You guys are on the same team. 
 Sorry. We... we'll work together. 
 See that you do. 
 Just run your tests and then report back to me. 
 All right. Thank you. Thank you. 
 All right. 
 Nice job. 
 Really? You're blaming me? 
 Yeah. 
 Yeah, don't worry. I'll solve this. 
 [Blows air] Right. 
 Gwen : Any word on Scott? 
 Okay, the rumor mill? It is in full force. 
 Yeah. You know, was it his fault? 
 Wasn't it his fault? 
 Right. 
 I can't imagine what he's going through. 
 Yeah, my buddy on the force said he might be facing charges. 
 Really? 
 Mm-hmm. 
 Hey, I'll see you later? 
 Yeah. 
 Jordan. 
 Yeah? 
 Fresh off the scan Shane's heart echo. 
 It's weird. His ejection fraction is way down. 
 Shane : Hello, ma'am. 
 I'm Dr. Beckman. 
 You think this is weird? Look at that. 
 I hate to be the one to deliver this news to you, ma'am, but you have lupus, and... 
 Maybe the herpes. 
 Shane? 
 I'm here for my bunion. 
 I understand, ma'am. 
 Shane, what is going on? 
 I'm sorry. He's not a doctor. I apologize. 
 What do you mean I'm not a doctor? 
 You don't think I know who I am? 
 Baby, this is not funny. 
 Yeah, stop fooling around. 
 No, but my name's Dr. Beckman. 
 I sincerely apologize. 
 And this... this... this woman here, she's in serious troub... [Coughing] 
 Jordan : Let's get you back... Drew! 
 Oh, my God! 
 [Continues coughing] 
 [Speaks indistinctly] 
 Baby! 
 Drew : Let's get him on his side. 
 Shane! 
 Jordan : Somebody get a gurney, please. 
 Lindsay : You gotta help him! 
 [Monitor beeping steadily] 
 Okay. 
 You see there? 
 Now Shane's bleeding is caused by dilated veins in his throat called varices. 
 They can be caused by alcoholism. 
 It is possible that he never stopped drinking? 
 No, I believe he quit. 
 I mean, he makes things up, but he's not a liar. 
 Well, did he ever have a psychiatric evaluation? 
 No. Not since I've known him. 
 Okay. 
 Listen, I know how people talk, and I know that he can be boastful, but that is... [inhales deeply] 
 That's just part of being in the rodeo, you know? 
 And stretching the truth's just part of the charm. 
 Well... 
 Pretending to be a doctor is a step beyond boastful. 
 Yeah. That did kind of freak me out. 
 Yeah. You just hang tight, okay? 
 [Monitor continues beeping steadily] 
 [Telephone ringing] 
 Wait, in... in which case, liability is  unlimited? 
 That... 
 Hold... hold on a second. 
 What is it, Michael? 
 You have visitors. 
 They say they've been waiting a long time. 
 Greg, I gotta... I gotta call you back. Okay. 
 [Hangs up receiver] 
 They want more than a drug test, don't they? 
 Yeah. 
 And I overheard them talking about pressing charges for reckless driving. 
 [Telephone rings] 
 [Whispers] Okay. Uh... stall them. 
 What? What do you mean "stall them"? 
 What do I say? 
 Tell them the truth. 
 Tell them the kid is critical, and I'm talking to Scott now. 
 [Telephone rings] 
 
 
 
 [Monitor beeping steadily] 
 Heather : Pulse ox is holding at 91%. 
 Fine job stopping the bleeding. 
 Had to take out half a lung to do it. 
 Stabilize the rib while I drill? 
 Yeah. Go ahead. 
 [Whirring] 
 Guy, I hate to have to do this. 
 Scott, I need you to come downstairs with me. 
 You gotta be kidding me. 
 What the hell's going on? 
 Tee, please just take over. 
 Are you insane? The boy has a hole in his chest. 
 Y-you think I wanna do this? The police are downstairs. 
 Well, the police can wait. 
 Let me give you a reality check, Scott. 
 They're talking about filing charges down there. 
 That's right. Take the damn drug test. 
 No, I'm not leaving the kid. We need one more hour, and then they can do what they want. 
 Give him the hour, Toph. 
 One hour. 
 I don't know that I can, but I'll try. 
 You okay? 
 [Sighs deeply] Do I have a choice? 
 Stabilize the rib. 
 [Whirring] Got it. 
 [Siren wailing] 
 You really cried watching "Finding Nemo"? 
 Oh, my God. Like a freakin' baby. 
 I mean, his mom gets killed the first minute. 
 Are you serious? Who put that in a kid's movie? 
 I'm freakin' almost tearing up thinking about it right now. 
 Stupid-ass barracuda. 
 I was surprised it got you. 
 Why do you always say stuff like that? 
 Like what? 
 Like you're always surprised that I feel this or that I feel... 
 Basically, that I show my feelings.

 I... I'm just giving you crap. Whatever. 
 You're a guy. I'm not used to that from guys. 
 Okay, what are you used to in guys? 
 Well, you know that I've dated, like, 10,000, so let me see... 
 Ahh. There we go. I remember this. [Chuckles] 
 We're deflecting again. You know, you do that a lot. 
 Okay, so I'm always... 
 Surprised by you and I always deflect. 
 Is there anything else you'd like to comment on? 
 Look, I'm not putting you down. We're just talking. 
 Mm-hmm. We just... we're having casual conversation. 
 Yo, listen, I-I deflect, too.

 You know what I'm talking about, when I don't want to talk. 
 No, that's... I-it's not that I don't wanna talk. 
 It's just, I don't want to talk about that.

 Oh! Oh! Ah!

 Yep. 
 Hold up. Hold up. Hold on. 
 Okay, who saw this man fall?

 No. I didn't think so.

 Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.

 And every time, it's the same story... fell off the roof. 
 And every time, he just wants more Oxy.

 You know what? 
 I-I don't think we should talk about anything other than the case right now, Paul. 
 Okay. All right. Well, um... 
 Let's, uh, review what we have here. 
 It's a weird collection of symptoms. 
 Uh, inflamed pancreas. 
 Pleural effusions. 
 Trouble breathing. 
 Increasing pain. 
 All in a 14-year-old girl. 
 [Page rustles] 
 [Indistinct conversations] 
 Catherine's on the J.V. squad, right? 
 Uh, yeah. 
 But she's pissed she's not on varsity. 
 And she wants a scholarship to college. 
 I mean, what if she's trying to impress her dad? 
 Yeah. It wouldn't be the first time. 
 That's our answer. 
 Her carpal tunnel isn't from texting, is it? 
 We need a hormone panel. 
 Yeah. Come on. 
 Let me make this as clear as I can. 
 If you pull Scott Clemmens from this surgery, you are endangering this boy's life. 
 We were told there's another doctor up there. 
 You're a doctor. You can replace him. 
 No, it doesn't work that way. 
 Scott Clemmens is our on-call surgeon. 
 I just spoke with Scott. 
 They just need one more hour up there. 
 They have a warrant, Topher. 
 We just got a bystander video from the accident. 
 This will change your mind. 
 [Rap song playing] 
 Man : He ran right through that stop sign. 
 [Monitor beeping rapidly] 
 Heather : B.P.'s down to 74 systolic. 
 Something's wrong. 
 It's not just a bleed. 
 Scott, we got company. 
 Guys, I did what I could. 
 Scott : I said we needed more time. 
 They have you on video, Scott. 
 [Police radio chatter] 
 Scott Clemmens. San Antonio Police. 
 You need to come with us right now. 
 [Monitor continues beeping rapidly] 
 I'll be back. 
 Okay. Yeah. 
 Dr. Callahan, what should we do? 
 Let's just hope he passes that test. 
 I can't breathe. I can't keep my breath. 
 It's okay. Just breathe. 
 I'm trying. 
 There she is. My wild Texas Rose. 
 Hi, Shane. How you feeling? 
 [Monitor beeping steadily] 
 He's gettin' weaker. I never seen him this bad. 
 I'm all stove up, ready for the big dance. 
 Shane, don't talk like that. 
 I been ready for some time, baby. You know that. 
 I'm at peace with the world. 
 That's the delusions talking, isn't it? 
 Doctor, isn't it? 
 Please tell me that it is. 
 I'm sorry. We have a few more tests that we need to run. 
 Um... Drew, can I speak with you outside? 
 Yeah. Excuse me. 
 [Curtain rings swoosh] 
 I put in a swan. He's got a little upper cardiac failure. 
 I couldn't figure out the cause. 
 Okay, what about the psychotic behavior? 
 Comes and goes. Two minutes ago, he was a Navy S.E.A.L. 
 But it's weird 'cause he keeps telling the same rodeo story, but it's got different people in it each time. 
 All right, let's run another scan. 
 And could you please bring Lindsay out? 
 I need to talk to her in private. 
 Yeah. Okay. 
 Thank you. 
 Any news from T.C.? 
 Yeah, he's still in surgery. Topher's assisting.

 Yes. Ten times. 
 I was driving to the clinic. I was running late. 
 I looked down for, like, 2 seconds.  Maybe  2 seconds.

 Okay, Shane's heart is not pumping enough blood, and we're trying to figure out why. 
 Has he had any mental changes before this? 
 Oh, well, little slips here and there. 
 I-I was afraid it might be Alzheimer's. 
 Mm. Those are called confabulations. 
 See, he's not forgetting. He's making things up. 
 You know, about his past, who he is. 
 Might that have something to do with his disease? 
 It might. 
 I know that he's had problems with alcohol, but... What about this diet? 
 Shane is all about the protein. 
 Rice and shrimp.

 Jordan, you know that I haven't had a drink in over 10 years. 
 I still go to meetings. 
 Swear that when those results come back, they will be negative. 
 I swear. 
 For anything. 
 Yes. 
 On your mother. 
 On... My... Mother. 
 What are you talking about? 
 I'm talking about your test results will take another 45 minutes... 
 [Exhales deeply] And Malik does not have that time. 
 So we are signing off on the results. 
 [Sighs deeply] You're you're faking them? 
 No. We're just saying that they're negative, which means we are all going out on a limb for you. 
 So I need to know that I can trust you when you say that those results will be clean as a whistle. 
 Because that's what they're going to be, right? 
 Yes. They will. 
 Okay. 
 All right. 
 Heather : Heart's tachy to 158. 
 B.P. only 64. 
 Topher : You were right. It's an air embolism. 
 Yeah, already in the heart. 
 That bubble reaches the kid's coronary, he's dead. 
 Increase O² to 100%. 
 I'm losing his pulse. 
 Topher : [Whispers] Damn it. 
 Okay, I can try to aspirate the air from the atrium. 
 But, uh, let's place the central line. 
 No time for that. He'll be dead by then. 
 So what do we do? 
 We take it directly out of the heart. 
 Have you done this before? 
 Yes. Only about a dozen times. 
 [Monitor beeping steadily] 
 There is the embolism. 
 You got it. 
 Okay, this is Thiamine, or Vitamin B. 
 Now your body doesn't have enough of it, and it hasn't in a long time. 
 Okay, let's get your over on your side. 
 Wait. That... that's it? A vitamin? 
 Well, the deficiency has caused Shane to suffer an illness called Korsakoff Psychosis. 
 Now if severe, it can really mess with your heart. 
 That and, well, you make things up. 
 What are you talking about? She's calling me a liar. 
 You are one, Shane. 
 Aah! Jesus!

 Regular Thiamine and a diet other than just shrimp, and... No alcohol. 
 A-alcohol? No, I-I, uh, I don't take the drink. No, uh...

 No, his behavior won't stop right away. 
 It might take a few months to clear up.
