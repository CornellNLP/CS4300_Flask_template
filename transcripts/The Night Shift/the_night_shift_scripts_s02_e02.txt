 So, about Jordan. 
 Ah, don't worry. 
 We're just taking it one day at a time. 
 No, I-I don't care about that. 
 I just want to know if she plans on taking this job back. 
 Oh, I don't know. 
 I mean, I know she prefers looking after patients than running the night shift, but she likes being in charge. 
 Wait, no. You want the job. 
 You're starting a coup. 
 No, hey, I'm not starting a coup. 
 I hated the job at first, but Janet wants to stay home with the twins, and I think this would make that possible. 
 You're starting a... you're starting a coup. 
 No, okay, stop. Please stop saying that. 
 Starting a coup. 
 Okay. [Chuckles] 
 Well, look, just ask her. 
 Well, you know, I-I don't want it to get weird between me and her, so I was hoping that you could ask her, that way if she wants... 
 Ooh-hoo-hoo! 
 I'm not getting in between you two. 
 Keith : Help! Help me! 
 Good luck with that. 
 My wife! 
 Help me! 
 I need a gurney here! 
 Please! I need some help! 
 Okay, what happened? 
 A couple weeks ago, I had some cattle stolen, so when I heard a noise in the barn... 
 So you shot her? 
 It was an accident! 
 She was supposed to be at her book club. 
 I didn't mean to shoot her. She came home early. 
 All right, what's her name? 
 Melissa. 
 Okay, sir, I need you to stay here. 
 Sir, stay here. 
 Kenny, I need two large-bore IVs, and let's unbundle her. 
 Paul, come on. 
 Sats are only at 84%. 
 Okay. All right, Melissa. Can you hear me? 
 Everything is gonna be all right, okay? 
 Your husband's outside. He's waiting to take you home. 
 We just need to fix you up a little bit. 
 But first, I need you to fight with me, all right? 
 It was a good book. 
 Yeah? 
 "The Great Gatsby." 
 Oh, tell me all about it. Keep talking to me. 
 I've never seen it. 
 Better than the movie. 
 I think we got a GSW to the left chest. 
 Kenny, open a chest tube tray and prep for a thoracotomy. 
 No breath sounds on the left side. 
 Uh, collapsed lung, right? 
 No, worse. 
 We got a tension pneumothorax. 
 Okay, we got a... a shifted trachea and extended neck vein. 
 10 blade. 
 Yep. 
 Set up for intubation. 
 I can't feel a pulse. 
 It was an accident! 
 Kenny! Kenny. 
 Get him out of here. 
 Sir! I know. Sir, sir. 
 You have to wait outside. I know. I know. 
 Keith : I'm sorry, baby! I'm so sorry! 
 [Elevator bell dings] 
 Oh! There you are. Hey. 
 Hey. 
 You ready? 
 Yeah. 
 We have a pancreatic tumor with our name on it. 
 Pancreaticoduodenectomy? 
 Yeah. But we just call it a whipple. 
 But I love your enthusiasm. See you in 30 minutes? 
 Yeah, I'll grab us a couple coffees. 
 [Monitor beeping] 
 What's going on? 
 Topher : Um, come here. 
 Husband accidentally shot his wife. 
 Well, if anyone can save her, it's TC. 
 Oh, don't put that kind of pressure on him! 
 He already does enough of that himself. 
 Why are you here on your night off? 
 Signed up for vet duty. 
 Oh. Aren't you dedicated? 
 To be honest, I was just itching to get out of the house. 
 You and Rick are still... 
 Yeah, it's just... tough right now. 
 I mean, It's just wearing me down because he's so negative all the time, and it's just hard to be around. 
 Mm. 
 And, I mean, I get it, but it's just tough. 
 You can't blame the guy. I mean, my back pain... it makes me want to punch somebody. 
 I can't imagine if I lost my leg. 
 Me neither. 
 He just needs to see a specialist at The Intrepid. 
 And then everything will be better once he gets his new prosthetic and he starts rehab. 
 When's that? 
 Ain't that the million-dollar question? 
 We're waiting on a referral from this Dr. Anderson at the VA. 
 Could be tomorrow, could be when pigs fly. 
 Woman :  Code Blue. 
 Ay. 
 Dr. Alexander, Trauma 2. Code Blue. 
 Dr. Alexander, Trauma 2. [Monitor emitting continuous tone] TC : Do it. Good. I need another set of hands. Where are you? Three units of blood, five internal defibrillations, four rounds of epi, two bicarb, still no response. No cardiac activity? Not for the last 15 minutes. I'm repairing the ventricle now. If we could just clamp the... The aorta. Yeah. The ventricle's shredded. Clamp across the artery. There. All right. Clamp is on. It's not working. And I'm done. [Monitor continues] Tee, still no cardiac activity. No, no, no, no, no. Okay, paddles. I need two more units of blood. Okay, clear. Clear. Okay, good, I need saline wide open. I need five units of epi. I'm gonna put it straight into her heart. I need 40 more units of Vasopressin. Okay? TC. The paddles again! Paddles again! Clear. Come on, come on, come on. Come on! TC She's gone. You need to call it. [Monitor continues] 19:05. [Monitor stops] That was brutal. He hasn't lost anyone in a long time. [Keith sobbing] I'm sorry. [Muffled rock music plays] [Sniffles] Hey. Tee. You want some company? [Music stops] You okay? [Chuckles] I've seen a lot of people die. You know, and... You never get used to it, but you learn to deal with it. Tee, you did everything that you could. See, if I did everything I could, then I would have saved her. You see the look on her husband's face? [Sighs] Being responsible for somebody else's death... Hey. We just got a call. Uh, ranch party outside of Yoakum. High school kids, booze, and drugs. Multiple injuries. Paramedics just arrived, and Gwen says there's one patient she can't move. She asked for you, Tee. I'm on it. All right? Wait. Yeah. Hey, Tee. Look, remember, you can only do your best. Let's hope it's good enough. [Telephone ringing] [Sighs] Hey, look. Can you... Well, we should probably see what that's all about. Gurney! [Siren wails] Gwen : Over here! This way! [Indistinct shouting] That's good. TC, follow me. All right, two kids pile onto the ATV, tried to outrun the cops. Driver lost control and ran into the barbed wire. Didn't know what to do. I figured he must have seen something like this in Afghanistan. Aah! I did see something like this in Afghanistan. Didn't end well. All right, we need to get this barbed wire out of him, or he's gonna bleed out. ♪ Can I get an officer to move these kids out of here, please? Everybody back up a little bit. Back up. Some bolt cutters. Cut most of these barbs out. I could pull the wire trimmer and save the small bowel. [Laughing] Oh, my God! What happened to Brian?! Ladies, I need you to step back and sit down, all right? Just move back. Thank you. Okay. TC, the IV is in. Thanks, Gwen. Aah! So, buddy, what's your names? Terrence, and... and that's Brian. Good. Terrence, can you, uh, hold that IV For me? Uh, o-okay. We took off when the cops got here. I swerved when I saw the barbed wire, but Brian flew straight into it. Let me take a look at that shoulder. I think you dislocated it. No, I don't even feel it. Just fix my friend, all right? Brian : Aah! How long have you guys been buddies? Tell me about it. We've been playing ball together since we were like 8 years old. Coach from Arizona state came by to watch us play tonight. Gwen : Yeah? How'd it go? He offered us both scholarships. All we ever wanted was to play ball in college together, and now I messed it up. Gwen, I need some irrigation. Hey, buddy, buddy. I know it hurts. I know, okay? But you're tough as nails, all right? I know you are. Okay, push another five of morphine. I'm on it. [Groans] All right, Brian. This is gonna help. You're doing great, okay? Doing great, Brian. Brian? Okay, he's out. So, this guy in Afghanistan ...worse than this? He's different. About the same age as this kid, except he had a few live RPGs in his gut. Oh, my God. You want to know what he said to me? He said he was sorry for getting me in this mess. He was afraid of getting  me  killed. You must have been scared to death. Well, actually, I was thinking, "this, uh, this thing goes off, there'd be nothing left of me to send home to Jordan and my mom." [Chuckles] You're lucky it didn't go off. No, no, it did. [Chuckles] It did. I stepped away for about 10 seconds to talk with Topher. He was gonna help me take the RPG out. Lenny Ross. Nice kid from Philly. I can still see the, uh, pimples on his chin. Hey, look. There's no RPG here, right? Get another five of morphine ready. Standing by. Topher! Yeah? Hey. Finished all your paperwork. Hey, any chance I get to work on some actual patients tonight? You know I'm not just a secretary. I do have four years of med school. I know. I know. You remind us every chance you get. I will get you some patients, but first, I-I lost my therastrap. Could you find one for me? I need a number 10. Therastrap. What? Didn't study that in your four years of med school? Never mind. Hey, Mollie. Mollie : Yeah? I need a number 10 therastrap for my back. Oh, okay. No, no, no, no. I g... I got it. I'll get it. Therastrap. Cool. Coming right up. Thanks. Therastrap, huh? It almost sounds like a real thing. Just getting him back for all those years of torturing us. Thank you. You got to break this pony, put a saddle on him. You down for some hazing? Oh, honey. I am down. Spread the word. Okay. BP is 90 systolic, heart rate's up to 120, and her glucose is 168. Jordan : Okay, well, she's not hypoglycemic, but her heart rate is out of control. Look, Jordan, I have a patient. Uh, call me if you need me. Okay. Hola. ¿Cómo se llama? Sandra. Sandra. Dr. Alexander. Uh, por favor, puedes cambiar su vesitdo? [Spanish accent] No, no thank you. I want to leave my dress on. Okay. So you speak English. Um, well, we need to do an EKG, so we're gonna need you to trade this gown for this gown. Sorry. [Sighing] All right. Let's see what we got here. Okay, Sandra. Are you currently on any medication? Any pain? This was a mistake. I don't know why I came here. I really have to go somewhere. He's waiting for me. He will be worried. And I have... Joey : Hey. It looks like somebody made the evening gown round. Yes. This is Sandra. It's okay. She came in here tachy and hypotensive, and I am guessing, by her attire, that, uh, maybe she took some diet pills. Yes. Yes, I did, for the competition. Ganaste? No, I didn't win. Sorry. Okay, Sandra, your heart is beating way too fast, so we're gonna give you some fluids and put you on a sedative to calm you down. Look, my sister used to be involved in all this pageant craziness. Uh, maybe she's taking a bunch of diuretics, too. Yeah. I'll run a metabolic panel. Okay. Okay. All right. Espero que te recuperés pronto. Sandra, you really don't have to look like these women on a cover of a fashion magazine. But that's how you win, and that's how I can get money for college. I get it, but you still have to take care of yourself, okay? All right, I will come back to check in on you. Okay? [Monitor beeping steadily] Hey! Krista! Hey. Hey. I noticed you were gone when I woke up this morning. Yeah, I just... I had to go back to my apartment and grab my gym stuff, so... Oh. Yeah. Hey. For me? Great. Chop, chop. We got work to do. Yeah. Hey, Kenny. Yo. Yo. Um, yeah, I'm just, um, trying to kiss some ass. Oh, I get that... kissing ass. As long as it's not literally. [Chuckles] You know, you can, uh, you can leave some stuff at my place. I'll... I'll clean out a drawer for you, all right? It's no big deal. It's just a drawer, though. [Laughs] It's... the drawer is never  just  a drawer. All right. You know? No, save me some work. [Chuckles] Yeah. It's cool. I'll see you. Yeah, I'll see you. Mm, mm, mm! Legs like a gazelle on that one. Yeah, that's incredibly inappropriate. I'm not the boss anymore. I am a physician's assistant now. Yeah, emphasis on the word "assistant." And, uh, hey. Topher's looking for you. Therastrap. [Scoffs] You have a sinus infection. I'll write you a prescription for Augmentin. Take it two times a day for 10 days, and the nasal spray, use at bedtime. Yep... [Cellphone vibrates] Excuse me. [Sighs] [Cellphone beeps] Hey. I know... I know the Vicodin makes you nauseous. Take the Zofran. N-no. His office hasn't called. I can't... Rick, it's the middle of the night. His office is closed. I can't make him call me. Okay. I love you, too. I got to go. I got to... [cellphone beeps] [Inhales deeply] Does anyone here know a Dr. Anderson at the VA? Uh, he's my friend's doc. She calls him Dr. Blackhole. Took six months for her to get a referral for a podiatrist. Did she try changing primary physicians? She tried, but they told her she'd go to the back of the line. Great. TC : Uh, damn it. Barbs are imbedded to deeply in this section of the small bowel. Every time I try and cut the ends, he bleeds. Let's get him to the hospital. Get me a board. Man : Yeah. All right, Brian. Stay with me. The bleeding's getting worse. We're losing him. He's not gonna make it like this. I have to stop this bleeding. Let's get him into the ambulance. I'll start the surgery. You want to do surgery in the ambulance? No. But it's that or he dies. [Indistinct talking] He's got a pulse. Shallow breathing. Let's go. [Siren wails] ...high-flow O2. Hang in there, Brian. Gwen : TC Damn it! He's hemorrhaging. I can't figure out what's bleeding. So what can we do? Wait, wait, wait. It's his iliac artery. Hand me my suture kit. I need something to clamp the distal and the proximal to the tear. Hemostats. Yeah. Okay. Place them right there. Place them together. Like this? Yep. Okay. Good job. See? There's the laceration. All right. I need 7-oh Prolene now. Woman :  Your call has been forwarded to an automatic... Hey, Sandra. How you feeling? [Monitor beeping steadily] Okay. Uh, well, just so you know, I did some research online, and I found a few organizations where you can apply for college scholarships and... you don't know anything about my life. You're right. I don't. I just... You're a rich, pretty, American doctor. You don't know me or what I have to do. [Monitor beeping erratically] [Speaking Spanish] So don't pretend you can come here... Heart rate's up to the 150s. [Breathing heavily] That's really strange. She's gotten worse with the benzos. [Monitor beeping steadily] She's in atrial fibrillation. Kenny, bolus her 5 of Metoprolol. Sandra, we're gonna give you new medication... and I'm sorry that I meddled. [Monitor beeping steadily] All right. All set. All right. Let's check on her every 15 minutes. All right. [Breathing shakily] [Exhales sharply] [Siren wails] Topher : Ladies and gentlemen, Welcome to our PSA on how  not  to party. These guys are tripping out on 'shrooms. This guy fell off a barn hiding from the cops... blunt head trauma and open forearm fracture. These girls are blind drunk... somebody get the vomit buckets. I want 'shrooms in 3. Drunkies in Exam 1 and 2. Paul, you're on broken arm. Anywhere that's open. Yeah, I got it. Hey, uh, your moment to shine. Forget about the therastrap for now. Place some IVs, hang some fluids. I'm all over it. Oh, oh, and order tox screens and alcohol levels, too, right? [Clicks tongue] Gold star. I need a trauma panel and four units O-negative. Mollie, notify Dr. Chavez, tell him he has an emergency case. I repaired the iliac and packed the abdomen, but he needs a formal laparotomy. Push 2 grams of Cefotetan. Here. Great job out there, Tee. You, too. What's happening? Is he getting operated on? Yeah, they're just prepping the OR, but you don't worry about it. But it's all my fault. I dragged him to the party. No. [Sighs] You're gonna tell me he had no interest in partying with hot chicks and he just wanted to stay home and play chess? We got our top surgeon working on it. He'll be fine. I promise. Can't you do it? No, 'cause it's not my job. Look, uh, if it makes you feel better, I'll go keep an eye on him, yeah? Kenny? This here is Kenny. He's gonna look after you, set you up for your shoulder. Uh, Terrence... T... man, I been to a couple of your games, man. My, uh, my little cousin's on the team... Ray Fournette. Oh, Ray-Ray. He's one of our best linebackers. Ah, man, he's all right, man. But, you, man, you the man. Oh, thanks. Uh, I think Ray said something about you. You played at UT, right? Yeah, something like that, yeah. Too bad you're old now. [Chuckles] Think you could still play? You look in okay shape. [Chuckling] Okay? Hey, don't let the scrubs fool you, baby. You can crack an egg on these bad boys. [Both laugh] All right, look, man, I'm gonna finish up some paperwork, then I'll be back in a second, all right? Now, hang tight. Hey, what's the story with the beauty queen? She's in a-fib. I got her on beta blockers to rate control. I also managed to insult her by giving her advice that she certainly didn't ask for nor am I qualified to give. Well, that's what you're good at. I, uh... uh, giving advice. I mean, you're not afraid to... I'm gonna go back to my reports. Mm-hmm. Yeah, so, uh... What's the deal with that? Every time I look up, you're buried in paperwork. You know, it really sucks. Uh, you're gonna hate it. When they didn't replace Ragosa, all this work fell on me... And eventually you. You know when you take... take your job back. [Instinct announcement over P.A.] I'll meet you in the suture room. All right. Drew, uh, hey. I didn't know you were here tonight. Yeah, working with the vets. That's the seventh time Rick has called me. I don't even know what to say to him anymore. I can't force his VA Doctor to see him. Yeah, well, it's a mess over there. Yeah, but it's driving me crazy. I'm a problem-solver. I'm the guy who builds your Ikea furniture, I figure out what's wrong with your car, but this stuff with Rick... I don't know how to fix. He probably just wants you to be there for him. You know, like a... a shoulder to cry on. [Pager beeping] Oh. It's my beauty queen. I'm sorry. Why don't you have breakfast with us after the shift? All right? We'll work it out. [Chuckles] Uh, I don't understand. What are you doing? Starting an IV No, you're stabbing this girl all over the place. You're lucky she's too drunk to know the difference. Give me that. [Slurring] I'm not drunk. That's right, baby. [Speaking indistinctly] Uh, w-what's, uh, what's going on? Ragosa's slashing this girl like Jason from "Halloween." Oh, come on. It wasn't that bad. I love Halloween. Young girl : I love Jason. Okay, uh, well, I-I can show you, if you want. Um... Hey, Mollie, I-I got it. Thanks. Oh. Oh. Bye, Mollie. Yeah. Okay. I'll miss you. So, um, my trick is that, uh... here you go... that I have them squeeze the ball... That's what she said. No, you mean "that's what  he  said." No, that's not what I... Dumb-ass. I a... okay, I am not a dumb-ass. You're a doodie. All right. Guys, guys. Whoa, hey, guys, please, trying to work here. That's what she said. [Laughs] Oh, that one didn't work as good. [Laughs] What do we got? She got 3 liters of saline and two rounds of Metoprolol, but her heart rate just keeps going up. Okay, she should be responding to treatment by now. Okay, get me another EKG and start her on Amiodarone. Everything's great. Baby's heartbeat is fine. I think you just have a little indigestion. Hey. Becca, this is Michael. You need something Michael? I've done five IVs, ordered tox screens on everybody, cleaned up a lot of vomit. But still no therastrap? No. PT needs to order it. Ah, they always say that. Um, it's just... you know, when you gave me this job, you said I'd be doing medicine. Well, that list you just gave me sounds pretty substantial for a physician's assistant. I mean, five IVs means five patients. Why don't you be responsible for them and check their blood work? Right. We love messing with that guy. Antibiotics running in. Good. Blood pressure's up to 90 over 45. That's good news. I heard you performed an iliac repair in a moving ambulance. That's very impressive. It wasn't my first choice, but the packing wasn't slowing down the bleeding, so... He would have bled out. It's a good call. [Sighs] I can work with that. Let's get him up to the OR. Okay. Right behind you. What, you'd like to observe? No, no. I'm going to assist. Hang on. Uh, Heather, why don't we get Brian prepped for surgery. I'll be right behind you. Sure thing. Okay. [Sighs] 
 
 I heard about how you banged heads with Scott. I know you even fought. No. I wouldn't listen to what he says about me. No, I know it's personal. Guy moves down here to be with his girlfriend only to find out she's in love with her old boyfriend, I mean... I'd be pissed, too. Is there a point here? Yeah, the point is that's not our history, all right? We have more in common. We both served, we both saw some things we wish we hadn't. I'd just like to think we have a bond in that. Right. Is this your way of telling me you don't want me in the OR? No, I just don't want the usual ER/surgery conflict, okay? You're welcome to come up there any time. You just have to respect that I'm in charge the way that you're in charge down here. All right, you trust my leadership the way I trust yours. Mm. Hey, uh, Tee. Yeah. Do you got a sec, man? Uh, Jordan needs you. Yeah. You see, there's already not enough of you to go around. You come on up if you're able to. I have a young, healthy patient in a-fib, cardiac markers and electrolytes look normal. She's been given three rounds of beta blockers plus Amiodarone, and she's just getting worse. Look at her BP. Yeah, I know. That's after 15 of Metoprolol. It doesn't make any sense. [Monitor beeping rapidly] Oh. There was no chest trauma. Let's go... strip and flip. Hey, Sandra, we're gonna figure out what's going on with you, okay? All right, here we go. Up. [Sighs] Other side. Any punctures? Nothing. Okay. Okay. Are those implants? They look like they were done by a butcher. Bargain basement cosmetic surgery. Yeah, but implants shouldn't make her this sick this fast. Maybe she's getting septic. No fever, plus her blood pressure's going up, not down. [Monitor beeps erratically] Oh! She's seizing. Give me a bite block. Grab at least 10 milligrams of Diazepam. Kenny : Got it. Sats are dropping. Okay, hand me a non-rebreather. Jordan, there's something in there. [Monitor beeping rapidly] Oh, my God. She's crashing. Push the Diazepam. We need to get whatever's inside of her out now. Kenny : Diazepam's going in. All right, scalpel. [Monitor beeping rapidly] [Monitor beeping steadies] Okay. Okay, that is not an implant. Is that cocaine? Yeah. Must have leaked into her system. That explains her crazy vitals. She's got a highway of cocaine flowing into her bloodstream. Give her IV Phentolamine. This explains why the beta blockers were making her worse. I mean, really, who the hell would do this to her? TC : BP's coming down. [Sighing] Finally. What happened to the good old days of just hiding drugs up your butt? [Monitor beeping steadily] Young girl : Ooh. Ragosa : Shh. What the hell are you doing now? I just got the girls' blood work back. Their alcohol level is zero, but there's an anion gap acidosis. And look at them. They're completely wasted. Look, check this out, huh? Damn. See how that urine glows? That is weird. Yes, it is. Hey. Checking in on you guys. Ragosa's a pee detective now. Holy... Oh, yeah. See that? I think it's antifreeze. I bet they made their own moonshine. Our alcohol test only checks for ethanol, but antifreeze has ethylene glycol, which would explain the acidosis. So you're a toxicologist now? Oh. Just covered toxic alcohols in my board review class, if you must know. [Monitors beeping erratically] Whoa. They're both crashing. Uh, Mollie, get Topher. You needed me? I just need you to help me put this shoulder back in. Lie back, Terrence. This is a tough kid. He doesn't want to take a sedative for this procedure. Oh, you're gonna regret that. Heard it was pretty crazy out there. Yeah. Like Lenny Ross without the RPG. Lenny Ross... he'd be, like, what, 28 now? Yeah. Okay, Terrence. So Topher's gonna brace you, and I'm gonna pop your shoulder back in. You should have seen this kid out there, Topher. Really held it together for his buddy. [Shoulder cracks] Ugh! You okay? Oh. I think so. Can I see Brian now? Uh, not yet. He's... he's still up in surgery. I'll check in on him soon, okay? You're gonna be in rehab for a couple weeks, be a sling, but you'll be good as new and ready to kick ass at ASU next year That's great... more reason for you to bet. He... this guy is out of control. Joey : I got to give TC Props. He did a pretty good job considering the guy was ripped up by barbed wire. Although, I would have called a surgeon out there. Mm. He was an army doc. I mean, he's used to doing whatever it takes. That's the problem with battlefield doctors... they think they can do anything. Aren't you a battlefield doc? I used to be. I used to be a lot of things. But I want to know more about Dr. Krista Bell-Hart. Huh. No boyfriend, you want to be in emergency medicine, dad a doctor, both went to Harvard... How am I doing? No, I went to Stanford... on a scholarship. A scholarship. And my father installs air-conditioning systems, thank you very much. I stand corrected. And, uh... I've wanted to be a doctor since I was 9. What, your hamster died, couldn't save him? [Laughs] My mother died of breast cancer. I'm sorry. I didn't know that. I know you had the genetic screening, right? Uh, n-no. The BRCA testing? I know. I know. You know, for the people that care about you. I've been a little busy. [Chuckles] For 20 years? What are you waiting for? Yo, bud. Hey. It's amazing what you can find out about people on the Internet. [Chuckles] Yeah, people post all kind of weird stuff. What are you looking at? Anything juicy? Yeah, just found the home address for Rick's VA Doctor. I'm gonna pay him a visit tonight and make him sign Rick's referral request. And if that doesn't work, I just found out the name of his kid, so I'm just gonna call him, pretend he had an accident, tell him he's got to come down to the hospital, and make him sign it here. Yeah, no, that's a great idea. Mm-hmm. And when you get arrested for assault and battery, uh, will you sell me your condo? Oh, no. You'll probably be dead from him shooting you. He wouldn't shoot me. What are you, new? Come on, let's take a walk. Now. [Monitors beeping erratically] They have a wide anion gap acidosis. So is it possible they drank the antifreeze? It's very possible. They're in renal failure. Get me IV of Fomepizole. We don't carry that in the ER. I can page the central pharmacy tech. It's gonna take over an hour. Okay, there's no time. We need beer. Beer? Michael, somebody has beer in their trunk... it's Texas. Go ask. Go, go. Look, I know how you're feeling. All right? Me and my mom took care of my grandma. God knows I loved that woman like nobody's business. I mean, she was everything to me. But it was hard, nasty. Nobody prepares you for what it's like to take care of a sick family member. It makes you crazy, and right now, you're crazy. [Sighs] Maybe it's not the best plan. It's a stupid plan. It's not a stu... it's a stupid plan. You need to chill. All right? Take care of yourself first. It's like... it's like, uh, it's like on the airplane. They tell you to put your own oxygen mask on first, then you take care of your kid. 'Cause if something happens to you, man, w-what happens to them? Huh? You just come up with that? Maybe. That was good. That was good, huh? Mm-hmm. You like that? Hey, Ray-Ray's Uncle, any chance I can get some more of those painkillers? What's wrong? I got a real bad headache and... [Vomits] Terrence! You okay, man? [Shuddering] Get TC Got it. All right, everybody swears he doesn't drink or do drugs. TC : Yeah they're right. He's got increased pressure on his brain but no sign of trauma. See, he had a game earlier today. He plays running back. Probably got hit in the head 50 times. Maybe it's a concussion. One concussion wouldn't do this to him. Second impact syndrome. If he had a concussion, didn't have time to recover from it... The hits he took today would explain the swelling in his brain from a hematoma. Yeah. Push 100 grams of Mannitol. Why would they play him if he's still recovering from a concussion? This kid's an all-star. He's never coming out of the game. Probably wouldn't tell them, either, if he was going for a scholie. Okay, right pupil is dilating. Call the neurosurgeon. He's posturing. Okay. Ah, his brain's already herniating. He needs a burr hole to drain the hematoma. Scalpel. [Monitors beeping erratically] Yeah, this is Nurse Kenny Fournette in ER. I need, uh, neurosurgery. Uh, Dr. Johnson. Right. [Drill whirs] How long do we got? I need 911. TC : Okay, I'm almost through. Okay, that should do it. Okay. A neurosurgeon is 15 minutes out. He stopped posturing. Nice work. All right, let's get him to the OR The alcohol competes with the ethylene glycol for the receptors... Which stops the toxic conversion. Yeah, good excuse to always have a six-pack in your trunk. Good catch, Mollie. Thanks. What? Yeah, Mollie, uh... said she's brushing up on her toxicology and figured it all out. I got lucky, I guess. That wasn't luck. That was knowledge. You got a bright future, Mollie. How are you doing? You have a bright future? Mm. All right, good. Michael, I would watch out for this one. She might be gunning for your job. Hmm. Wow. Did that really just happen? Yeah, um... and, I... I'm sorry. Look, therastraps aren't really, uh, a thing. Y-you didn't hear that from me. Jordan : I heard that you were asking for food, and, unfortunately, we can't let you eat until after the plastic surgeon fixes your sutures. Just try not to move around too much. Are you going to call the police? [Sighs] I had to. I'm sorry. All you have to do is just tell them what happened. All right? And... you kn... [Sighs] You know what? I'm just... I'm gonna say this because I can't help myself, but look... If you need a lawyer, I have a friend, and she owes me a favor. I could talk to her. I'm sure she could take your case for free. Thank you. I know you're just trying to help. I'm gonna call her. All right. [Sighs] So keep me updated on his condition, and let me know when his parents get here. I'm gonna check on his buddy... Brian. All right. [Monitor beeping steadily] [Monitor beeping rapidly] Belly's filling. He's getting tachy. What is it? What's happening? We don't know. We're trying to figure it out. Okay, I'm scrubbing in. I'd be shocked if you didn't. What? Yeah, I found your therastrap. Number 10. Hope you enjoy it. I hope everyone had a good laugh. Ha, ha, ha. [Laughing] Well, we did have a good laugh. Hey, hey, are you gonna tell him that the save was my idea? I told... She gave you credit right from the top. I mean, this is a big team, Michael. We're just trying to help you fit in. Yeah. Mm-hmm. [Chuckles] Sandra, I... It's been one of those nights. I must have been sloppy suturing in the ambulance. You stopped the bleeding. You just accidentally cut off the blood flow. I screwed up. I should have just repacked the abdomen. I know vascular surgeons that have made the same mistake, and they weren't in a moving ambulance. I'm just gonna cut the suture, it'll pink right back up. Trust me. Let's get the bowel reperfused. More Motown? Do you ever listen to anything else? Not when I'm working. It's not so bad. All right, needle driver to Dr. Callahan. [Elevator bell dings] Anything? Nothing. [Sighs] Mollie, Mollie. Oh. Nothing. Nothing. [Sighs] Where... W-w-w-wait. Hey, hey, hey. Okay, honey, let me see. You tore your stitches. Mollie, can you get a gurney, please? Yeah. Okay. Honey, I don't know your life, but I know that running away is not gonna help you. He said they would take those things out, but I started to get sick in the car ride on the way to the place, and they pushed me out on the street corner, and now I'm gonna go to jail. He's your boyfriend, isn't he? Okay. Here's how I see it. He let someone mutilate your body, he asked you to commit a crime for him, and then he left you alone to die. You don't deserve this. [Cries] You're gonna be okay. [Sighs deeply] Great job in there. [Chuckling] Thanks. Oh, you saved his life. All we did was a bit of housekeeping. Nah, it was more than that. Thanks for letting me assist. Well, thanks for pissing Scott off and opening up this job for me. Yeah, I'm gonna go to talk to the mom. That was nice of you. I heard he lost a patient earlier. Yeah. Yeah, I used to know a lot of guys like him. I used to be like him. Take losses pretty hard. Anyway, I'm just trying not to be a dick. That's my mantra. You know, but I think you and TC Have a budding bromance. He clearly likes you. Well, um, he's not the one that I'm concerned about liking me. [Chuckling] Don't panic. I'm not talking about you. I-I was thinking about asking Jordan out. You know, 'cause I-I don't think the two of them are right for each other. Oh, uh, you know, I-I-I'm not sure that... [Laughs] Look at your face. I got you. Oh, my God. No, just... just for a second. It still counts. I'll see you later. Oh, coffee next time ...please, no sugar. It's the silent killer. [Siren wails in distance] Oh, thanks a lot. Mm. Hey, how'd it work out with the runaway beauty queen? We'll see. I'm not too optimistic about her future if that's her taste in men. How about you, huh? How you feeling? Ready to leave the desk work behind? I'm definitely feeling better, but being the boss does not suck. Okay. You've been hinting at something all night. What gives? We... we've known each other a long time. I just don't want things to get weird between us. You want to keep the job, is that it? Not... not if you want it. So, you're saying that you only want it if I don't want it? No, I-I don't want it if you... let's do this... um, count of three, we both say what we want, okay? One, two, three. I do want it. I don't want it. Oh. Hey. You... [Chuckling] Hey. Congratulations. You're the boss. All right. I'm so glad we got to work this out like grown-ups. Oh, yeah. Hey, uh, Topher, why do you have a plunger? This... this used to be a plunger. Now it's a scepter! Oh, boy. Word of advice... don't let the power go to your head. It is too late. [Clattering] What?! Oh. Very funny. Prank the boss. Wasn't me. I wonder who did that. Mm, yes. I wonder, too. You, really? T-that's not bad. That was me, too. [Chuckles] I can play just as hard as they can. I-I'd keep that quiet. Nobody messes with Mollie. How you doing? Did you hear? They say I'll never be able to play ball again. Yeah. Yeah, I heard. It's a tough break. You think? They told me Brian's gonna be fine. Yeah. He's gonna make a full recovery, and you helped with that. I'm sorry, man, I mean... I wish you could have played ball together, uh... Hey, Tee. Yeah? Can I talk to him for a sec? Yeah. Glad you're okay. You know, I've, uh, I've been where you are. I was a 5-star recruit, all-American, 20-some-odd scholarships, Man... I really don't want to hear about your stupid glory days right now. Now, that... that's true. That's true, my glory days. My glory days ended my freshman year when I fractured my back in training camp. Never played a game. I spent an entire year in traction, so, trust me, I do get where you're coming from. I do. Great. So, this is what I have to look forward to... being a nurse. Maybe I can clean some bedpans. You know what? I-I'm sorry. You may not what to talk right now, and I-I get that, but if you change your mind, want to talk about anything at all, whatever you want... I mean, anything... I'm around, all right? You get some rest. I'll, uh... I'm gonna check on you later. Don't forget what I said. Please tell me you're done with those forms. I had 10 runs in four hours. I need food. Okay, here you go, darling. Put this in your pie hole and give me another minute. Not a huge fan of cranberry. Eat it. [Sighs] Hey. Hey. You up for breakfast? No. No. Thanks. But I just need to be on my own for a little bit. I'll call you later. Hey. You sure you're all right? Yeah, it's just... I just keep thinking about the woman that I lost. Worst part of the job. Yeah. I'll be okay. All right. Promise. ♪ Your heart breaks ♪ Oh! Mm! Did you see that shot? Beautiful. I believe that's 20 bucks you owe me. What the heck? Clearly, you have this game at home.

Well, like, uh... when they told me I couldn't play anymore, I thought my life was over, but... but it wasn't. You know, before I got hurt, I thought nurses just cleaned up after patients, but they were so much more. I was lucky if I saw the doctor once a day. It was the nurses that took care of me. Nurses taught me to walk again. They make the hospital run. That's, uh, that's why I became one. So, in a weird way, that accident was the best thing that ever happened to me.
