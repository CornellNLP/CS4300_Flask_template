 I got the rejection letter from Loyola earlier. 
 Now this one from Seton Hall. 
 That's five law-school rejections. Game over. 
 We started moving it, then we saw her neck hanging by a thread... literally. 
 Where is she? 
 Right here. 
 What's going on? 
 Your wife was in an accident, and your son may still be at the crash site. 
 [Loud explosion] 
 What was that? 
 Major, we have casualties. 
 I gotta go. 
 24. 
 7. 
 I love you. 
 Sharbat, you're pregnant. 
 Do you have a husband? 
 Give me my wife! 
 Listen, I'm sick of your... 
 Give her to me. 
 Syd : Drew! 
 [Gunshot] 
 Drew! 
 [Echoing] Drew! 
 Drew! 
 Drew! 
 Are you okay? 
 Ohh. I'm shot! I'm shot! 
 GSW to the left shoulder! 
 Are  you  okay? 
 Yeah, yeah, the gun just went off, Syd. 
 Here. 
 I shot him. 
 He shot me! Arrest him! He shot me! 
 Yeah, and now he's gonna fix you up now so I can save your wife and baby. 
 You check him out. If his vitals are stable, you get him straight to C.T.! 
 [Akmal speaks indistinctly] 
 Can you at least do that? 
 I need someone to clean up this blood, stat! 
 Okay, where were we? 
 Okay, let's go, come on! 
 The pilot says the wind's gusting too much. It's not safe to fly. 
 Come on, Frankie. 
 He looks cyanotic. 
 Yeah. 
 Come on, little buddy. 
 His abdomen's rigid. He's bleeding internally. 
 We need to warm him up now or his blood won't clot. 
 I can warm him from the inside. 
 Frankie, honey, this is gonna sting a little bit. 
 [Groans] 
 It's okay, Frankie, we're gonna take care of you. 
 Scalpel. Yep. 
 All right, sweetie, here we go. 
 Chest tube. 
 Yep. 
 Come on. 
 I'm in! 
 Okay. 
 Saline. 
 Man :  5631, clear for takeoff. 
 All right, we've been cleared for takeoff. 
 He's waking up. Good job, Jordan. 
 Thanks. You too. 
 You okay? 
 Yeah. You? 
 Yeah. 
 I'm gonna be swamped, so I need you covering the E.R. for me, and remember, you represent the Surgical Department down there, so... 
 No reindeer games, I got it. 
 Yeah, and don't fight with that girl, Shannon. 
 She'll kill you. 
 How's Joan doing? 
 She was oxygenating a while, so I took her off the vent. 
 Still seems a bit confused, though. 
 She's acting nervous. 
 Asking a lot of questions about Frankie. 
 She's worried about her son. 
 I think I can help with that. 
 Joan, Francis. 
 I've got some good news. They found your boy. 
 Frankie?! 
 He's coming in now on medevac. 
 He's here? 
 Thank God, is he okay? 
 How is he? 
 You're tearing your sutures! 
 Joan, you should relax. Push morphine, please. 
 What is happening? 
 She tore her sutures. 
 We gotta get her to the O.R. before she bleeds out. 
 Dr. Zia will fill you in on your son. 
 Let's go, let's go! 
 [Crying] 
 Yes, Akmal's vitals are stable. 
 Yes, sir. We're waiting on the C.T. results to determine the location of the bullet. 
 Gen. Rozenfeld : But I told you to get them off the base, and I meant it! 
 This is the last we're discussing the matter! 
 Yes, sir. Yes, I will handle it. 
 I will. I will handle it. 
 [Sighs] 
 We are so screwed. 
 It was bad enough you lied to the general. 
 He brought a gun into the O.R. 
 What did you want me to do? 
 Let the MPs handle it. You know how this looks, Drew? 
 You didn't want Sharbat to go. That's on record. 
 Now you're involved with Akmal's shooting? 
 You could be facing an Article 15. 
 It was self-defense. 
 You want me to wait for backup to get there? 
 Akmal could have killed us all. 
 You do realize that, right? 
 You have nine days left, Major. 
 You want your daughter to be motherless because... 
 Don't ever, ever say that. 
 I'm just pointing out the fact... 
 This is over. This is the Army, Drew. 
 This is not a democracy. 
 We have orders to follow, and follow them, we will. 
 Okay, so just to hell with the Hippocratic Oath, then. 
 So here's how it's gonna happen, Just throw that out the window. all right? 
 When Sharbat and Akmal are stable, they leave. 
 We do not interfere with local medical decisions. 
 That comes straight from the Pentagon. 
 Okay, if I may... 
 No, you may  not,  Captain. 
 I have given a year of my life to this dump, and in 14 days, my daughter, Riley, turns 13, and I am going home. 
 I am not missing that because you forgot the chain of command. 
 Are we clear? 
 Yes, ma'am. 
 Sorry, ma'am. 
 ♪ 
 Jordan, you want to take Frankie up? 
 No, go on up. I'll stay on the floor. 
 We got Frankie's temp up. 
 He's in hypoglemic shock, injury to the bowel, filled the belly with blood. 
 We got to open him up to stop the bleeding. 
 Hang O-neg, put him on the cell saver. 
 I'm scrubbing in. 
 All right, Doctor. 
 Paul's closing on Frankie's mom right now. 
 Wha... I thought she was out of surgery. 
 She was despondent post-op, ripped her sutures. 
 We ran her back in. 
 [Sighs] 
 I was only with her two hours ago. 
 If I'd seen her maybe in the recovery room. 
 Hey, hey, you saved a dying woman. 
 You can't be in two places at one time. 
 Yeah, yeah, try telling  him  that. 
 If it's bad news, keep walking. 
 We got lucky. 
 Akmal just had a through and through in the shoulder. 
 I repaired it and sent him to recovery. 
 Hmm. 
 How's Sharbat? 
 Critical, but her cardiac output is good. 
 Her family sold her to that dirtbag when she was just 13, Major. 
 Man : Whoa, whoa, hold on! You can't go in there. Your sister's in surgery. 
 Sounds like Sharbat's brother finally tracked her down. 
 Son of a bitch. Now her drug-dealing brother's here? 
 She asked to see him, Drew. 
 I don't care. He's not coming in here. 
 Marquez, have the MPs bring him in. 
 Make sure he's been patted down. 
 Okay, bring him in, Sergeant. 
 My name is Omed Gilzhai. 
 I demand to see my sister! 
 Scary drug dealer, huh? How do you feel now? 
 Don't even. 
 Badass save out there, Doc. 
 We got lucky. 
 So, any chance you reconsidered what I asked? 
 Still not a good time, Sam. 
 "It's not you, it's me." Got it. 
 After three times, quit asking. 
 Satellite pharmacy, pick up extension 23. 
 You just went Dr. No on that hot fireman? 
 What? 
 Your nickname at the clinic. 
 After all the dudes you shot down. 
 [Chuckles] Who are you, Dr. Yes? 
 With him? Dr. Hell Yes. 
 Oh, man, Shannon, do not date guys from work. 
 It's not worth it, trust me. 
 Yeah. T.C. and Dr. Clemmens. 
 [Chuckles] That must have been interesting. 
 Shut it. 
 Sorry, filter malfunction. 
 Yeah. 
 Just got a new case. 
 Frat brother doing a "Jackass" gag. 
 Wrestled in a ring of thumb tacks. 
 Ow! 
 Relax. 
 I'm working him up, but I need you to sign off on my discharge first. 
 Ranchero with a cold wants to go. 
 Reminds me of my grandpa. 
 He used to run cattle on the res. 
 Presenting symptoms? 
 Weakness, chills, sounded viral. 
 Told him to go home and sleep it off. 
 Okay. [Speaking Spanish] 
 Gracias. 
 Okay, you missed something. 
 Positive belt buckle sign. 
 You're joking, right? 
 No. Stoic Hispanic men like him only see a doctor if there is something massively wrong. 
 But his exam is normal. 
 Did  your  grandfather go to the hospital? 
 Only if he thought he was dying. 
 [Clicks teeth] I'll see you in Curtain 1. 
 Yo, Toph. 
 Yeah. 
 Yeah, so I was thinking, all right, about you getting back out there. 
 I don't have time for your gym. 
 No, no, you don't have to. 
 It's good to go. 
 See, we can do it here. 
 I'll be your life coach. 
 [Laughs] 
 That's a good one. 
 [Scoffs] Okay, fine, I tried. 
 It's your life. Whatever's left of it. 
 Here's the labs you requested for the little boy in the O.R. 
 Thanks. Hey, Kenny! 
 Kenny. Look, I'm sorry I snapped at you. 
 If we were to do this... I do mean "if"... how would it work? 
 Well, for starters, we change your bad habits. 
 Stand while you chart. Hit the stairs. 
 I mean, have you ever heard of an apple? 
 That's like your third bag of chips in the last hour. 
 Look, I do want to get out and do more badass field stuff, but more than that, I just don't want to be the old dad at soccer who can't play with his kid. 
 As long as that gets me there. 
 Oh, absolutely. 
 I mean, you won't look like this, but you won't look like that. 
 Okay, Coach. 
 Yeah? 
 All right, let me track your heart rate, calories burned, and steps from my phone. 
 I use it with all my clients. 
 A little creepy, but okay. 
 I'm gonna see the kid. 
 Surgery's on the third floor. 
 Yeah, I know. 
 Oh! Hit the stairs? 
 Great idea. 
 There we go. Oh, after you. 
 So, Frankie injured his small bowel when he was thrown. 
 Our surgeon's removing the damaged tissue now, so... 
 We adopted Frankie. 
 Yeah. 
 We couldn't get pregnant. 
 We got him, and... he's part of us now. 
 If we lost him, Joan will never forgive herself. 
 She grew up Pentecostal. She thinks this is God punishing her. 
 I know how hard this is, but he's gonna make it. 
 I promise. 
 Do me a favor, Doc. 
 If you have bad news, you tell me, not Joan. 
 She can get a little hysterical. 
 Yeah, of course, Francis. You excuse me? 
 Okay. 
 Hey. 
 Hey. 
 I just got Frankie's labs. 
 His platelets and white blood cells are way down. 
 Does Scott know? 
 It's doubtful. 
 He's too busy putting him back together. 
 All right. 
 I just told Frankie's dad he was gonna make it. 
 Why'd you do that? 
 I don't know. It just kind of came out. 
 I guess I'd better go help Scott. 
 All right, Mr. Martinez, this might just be the flu, but we want to make sure it's nothing more serious, so we're gonna run a few more tests. 
 No tests, I just have a susto. 
 A "fright illness"? 
 Okay. 
 [Speaking Spanish] 
 I'm not scared of nothing. 
 Okay, well, I like your bracelets. 
 Are they helping with your arthritis? 
 Sí. My curandera gave them to me. 
 Your healer? 
 All right, well, did she give you anything for your susto? 
 Well, I don't get it. I mean, if you have a cure, why are you here? 
 My patron won't let me work without a doctor's note. 
 I break horses. 
 My gramps did that. He put them on a long rope, let them run, then bring it in a little at a time. 
 They're like people. They hate being told what to do. 
 I like this girl. She's smart. 
 All right, I tell you what. Why don't you let us do our jobs so we can get you back to yours? 
 Okay. 
 [Monitor beeping] 
 He beat her when she was pregnant? 
 And that's not against the law. 
 Akmal  is  the law. 
 We shamed him by trying to leave, and after the baby comes, he will kill us both, unless I can get us to Australia. 
 It's the Stone Ages, I get it, but our hands are tied. 
 [Monitor beeps rapidly] 
 The baby's having recurrent decelerations. 
 Damn. The uterine lac is extended. 
 My baby? 
 How's my baby? 
 Everyone is fine. 
 You have a visitor. 
 Omed? You didn't go? 
 Without you, never. 
 The uterine lac is rapidly expanding. 
 How many C-sections have you done? 
 Two. 
 Great, that's one more than me, you're hired. 
 How's he doing? 
 Removed the injured bowel, but he's oozing everywhere. 
 'Cause he has no platelets. He needs them to clot. 
 These should help. 
 Temp's up to 104. 
 He went from freezing to burning up. 
 His white blood cell count is down, too. 
 You thinking what I'm thinking? 
 Traumatic bone marrow failure. 
 Without working bone marrow, he can't make new blood cells, which means he can't clot or fight infection. 
 He needs a transplant. Go test the parents for a match. 
 Won't help, he's adopted. 
 Well, then, try and track down his birth mother. 
 That's his best shot. 
 We can start him on antibiotics and slow the infection, but without a transplant. 
 All right, I'm on it. 
 Find me a match, or he's not gonna make it! 
 Now, you sure you don't want us to put you under? 
 You could wake up, and your son would be right here. 
 No, not with Akmal around. 
 I have to be awake to protect my son. 
 I would do the same thing. 
 You have kids, Doctor? 
 I do. I have a daughter named Riley in Texas. 
 She's gonna be 13 in two weeks. 
 I married Akmal at 13. 
 Yeah? 
 Riley's gonna have a slumber party for her birthday. 
 It's gonna be no boys allowed. 
 Drew : Your daughter's lucky to have such a strong role model. 
 The Army's tough on women, especially moms. 
 Yeah, well, if you don't push for change, it never happens. 
 You got that right. 
 It still sucks. 
 My ex has this girly girlfriend, Lexi. 
 She got fake nails, hair, boobs, the whole thing. 
 She wants Riley to do beauty pageants. 
 [Monitor beeping rapidly] 
 Aah. 
 Baby wants out. 
 Is he okay? 
 He's gonna be fine. We have to start the surgery now. 
 So I want you to breathe like I showed you. 
 In through the nose... out through your mouth. 
 Starting low transverse incision. 
 Through the nose, out through the mouth. 
 Aah! 
 Tell me more about her... Riley. 
 Well, she's... she's tall, like her daddy, and she can beat up any boy in her class. 
 I guess she gets that from me. 
 We got this, Sharbat. 
 Hey, Topher. You called for a surgical consult? 
 I did. Where's Scott? 
 In surgery. I'm covering the E.R. for him. 
 That's all right. I'm good. 
 I had a bowel obstruction I wanted a consult on. 
 I was 99% sure it wasn't acutely surgical, so I sent him up. 
 Oh. 
 Okay. Uh... 
 If you... you change your mind, then. 
 Hey! 
 I'm... I'm sorry. 
 It's hard to headline in your hometown. 
 I'm from Philly. 
 No, it's an expression. 
 You started as an intern, so everybody sees you as their little brother. 
 You want to be taken seriously, present with authority. 
 You are a surgeon. Own it. 
 Copy. 
 His sodium levels are good, which rules out hypernatremia. 
 Did you check his herbs? 
 Rosemary and basil, all benign. 
 Excuse me. 
 I'm looking for Augusto Martinez. 
 I'm his daughter, Carly. 
 One moment, please. 
 Thank you. 
 Here. 
 Uh, excuse me, Miss Martinez? 
 Yes. 
 I'm Dr. Alexander. 
 This is Dr. Rivera. We're helping your dad. 
 Is he okay? I was in my office. 
 I didn't get the message. 
 At 1:00 a.m.? 
 I'm in the middle of a big case. 
 He's lethargic, claims that his spirit was frightened from his body. 
 [Scoffs] That stupid witch doctor. 
 Well, did anything happen to him recently? 
 Was he in an accident? 
 [Phone rings] 
 Not that I know of. 
 I'm sorry. It's my client. 
 We're in court in the morning. I'll find you. 
 Hey, Greg, we're filing for... 
 Jordan. 
 Yeah. 
 Mr. Martinez' BP is dropping in Curtain 1. 
 He just passed out. 
 Hey. 
 How's she doing? 
 Still sleepy. 
 Yeah. 
 How's my son? 
 He has an infection in his blood. 
 We're keeping it in check with antibiotics, but his bone marrow has gone into failure. 
 He can't make white cells to fight the infection. 
 He's gonna need a transplant. 
 Transplant? 
 Yeah. 
 We need to find his birth mother. 
 You still in contact with her? 
 Francis? 
 She was a drug addict. 
 It was a closed adoption. We never met. 
 Test me, maybe I'm a match. 
 Yeah, the chances of a random match are very slim. 
 No, please, Doc, I want to do everything I can for my son, even if it's one in a billion. 
 Okay. 
 I'll go tell her. 
 Okay, Mr. Martinez, your heart rate and your temperature are abnormally low, which is why you passed out. 
 What's causing it? 
 Hard to say. 
 So far, his tests are all normal, but we'd like to check a few more things. 
 No more tests. I can't afford 'em. 
 You don't have to, papi. 
 I don't want your money, Carolina. 
 Why not? Because I'm not cleaning houses like Ernesto's daughter? 
 Or selling sugar pills like your witch doctor? 
 Okay, everybody, let's just focus here. 
 Don't you look down your nose at me. 
 Not you, the con artists. 
 Folk cures are placebos. Studies show hope helps patients get well. 
 [Laughs] 
 The only thing healthy here is her bank account. 
 She's robbed him blind. 
 At least she listens to him. 
 You didn't even know he was sick. 
 Excuse me? 
 Okay. 
 Uh, Dr. Rivera, a word outside? 
 Oh! 
 Hey, Kenny, I didn't, uh, see you. 
 Dude. 
 What? 
 This thing has 50 grams of sugar. 
 Okay, look. It has 1% daily riboflavin. 
 [Laughs] 
 It's basically medicine. 
 How did you find me, anyway? 
 Ta-da! 
 You know, this tracker, you'd make a really good stalker, Kenny. 
 You should think about a career change. 
 Yeah, you should think about stepping it up, man. 
 My grandma moves more than you. 
 She should take it easy, then. 
 Ray. 
 Hey. Hey, brother. 
 Can you do me a favor? 
 When you're moving patients around, can you wear this? 
 But I already got one, Dr. Z. 
 Well, now you have two. 
 And look, it comes with  this. 
 If anybody asks you, you didn't get it from me. 
 Thanks, Ray. 
 So, what the hell was that? 
 You do not take sides in a family argument. 
 Do you hear me? 
 She's bullying him. 
 My mom did that to my grandpa. 
 His voice was like a dog whistle to her. 
 Shannon, you cannot bring emotion into this job. 
 It clouds your judgment, and it can hurt your patient. 
 So, be a robot. 
 Be professional. 
 I gave you a lot of leeway at the reservation clinic, but it is not gonna fly here. 
 It won't happen again. 
 Yeah, you're damn straight it won't. 
 Annie : Jordan! 
 Annie. 
 I heard a rumor that you were back. 
 I'm sober, five months now. 
 Yeah, TC didn't mention it. 
 Well, you guys have a lot of stuff to not... talk about besides me. 
 I'm sorry about everything that happened with... 
 Uh-uh, that's not necessary. 
 I know, I just... 
 I-I got to say this, too. 
 Hi, Topher. 
 Oh, hey. 
 You always tried to help me, and I repaid you by being a total bitch, and look... I'm really sorry. 
 I-I'm not asking for forgiveness, Jordan. 
 I'm just trying not to make the same mistakes again. 
 How's that going for you? 
 It sucks, but in a good way, so I'm volunteering at a halfway house. 
 I'm gonna be here from time to time. 
 I'll see ya. 
 What? 
 [Chuckles] It's crazy, right? 
 She showed up one month ago, gave Tee 47 bucks, determined to pay him back. 
 I hope it works out, right? Time will tell. 
 Wow, I did not see that coming. 
 Dr. Alexander, my dad, he won't wake up! 
 Just fix him! Do something! 
 Hey, Toph, I need Frankie's adoption records ASAP so I can contact his birth mother. 
 Does your cousin still clerk for the State? 
 Yeah, yeah, I'll... I'll call him right now, but I gotta be honest, dude. 
 It's a needle in a haystack the size of Texas. 
 Just try, okay? 
 Okay. 
 Oh, my God! 
 Gwen? 
 You okay? 
 Uh, yeah, yeah. Have you seen Kenny? 
 I'm dodging him, actually. 
 Oh, he ran a patient up to Radiology. 
 Be back in 10. 
 [Radio chatter] 
 Copy that, we're on our way. All right, I gotta jump. 
 Wait, you want me to leave him a message? 
 No, no, I'll catch him after the shift. 
 Thanks, Topher. 
 Happy to help. 
 [Baby gurgles] 
 He's beautiful, Sharbat. You did great. 
 Cutting the umbilical cord. 
 Here, let's clean him up. 
 [Monitor beeps rapidly] 
 He's not breathing. 
 [Gasps] Please help him! 
 We will. We just need you to stay calm. 
 I lost his pulse. 
 Please, save my baby. 
 Please help him! 
 Come on, buddy. Come on. 
 Please save my baby. Please save him. 
 We need to push epi. We don't have a line, so we'll go through the umbilical cord. 
 Save my baby! Please help him! 
 [Sobbing] Oh, my God. 
 Pushing the catheter. 
 What's happening? 
 Please save him. 
 Tie it off, Doctor. 
 Okay, I'm in. Come on. 
 Try to stay calm, Sharbat. We got this. 
 Push the epi. 
 Epi in. 
 Here we go. 
 Come on, buddy. 
 Come on. 
 Come on. 
 [Sobbing continues] 
 [Baby cries] 
 There he is. 
 Good set of lungs on him. 
 [Laughs] 
 No pneumonia or tumors. 
 What are all these bony abnormalities on the chest X-ray? 
 Scarring from old fractures. 
 These guys, they get thrown off horses, kicked. 
 I told you, they're tough. 
 Yeah, they are. 
 [Monitor beeps rapidly] 
 Okay, his heart rate keeps dropping. 
 Let's give him 0.5 of atropine. 
 It's not doing anything. 
 All right, let's put him on pacer pads. 
 We might need to pace him externally. 
 
 
 
 I talked to the Chief of Internal Medicine at Northwest, and she said that this is a "beta blocker overdose," and he needs glucagon right now. 
 Okay, that's an interesting theory, except he's not on beta blockers. 
 Then what's wrong with him? 
 I don't have an answer. 
 Well, you better find one because if you don't, I'm gonna sue you and this lousy excuse for a hospital for malpractice. 
 Is that how you handle everything, to bully people? 
 You know, maybe if you spent a little less time on that phone of yours and more time with him, he wouldn't be here. 
 Do as I say, not as I do, right? 
 Shannon, right now I need smart. 
 Smart-ass is a waste of my time. 
 All right, we've obviously missed something, so let's run his labs again. 
 General Rozenfeld called. 
 Mark has told him both patients are in recovery. 
 I talked to Omed. 
 They can still make it to Australia. 
 No, it's too late. 
 Akmal's gonna wake up any minute now. 
 Actually, I miscalculated his weight during anesthesia. 
 I thought he was 220. Turns out he's 180, so the post-op morphine might have been too much. 
 You dosed him? On whose orders? 
 My patient, my call, right? 
 [Sighs] 
 We can get them back on track, Major. 
 We can do this. We've come this far. 
 Dr. Syd? You want to hold Umayd? 
 [Baby cooing] 
 Umayd. That's a beautiful name. 
 It means hope. 
 What did you have in mind? 
 Dr. Rivera? 
 Not now, Paul, I'm charting. 
 It's Dr. Cummings. 
 [Scoffs] Dr. Cummings. 
 Somebody put on his big-boy pants. 
 Try it some time, Nurse Fournette. 
 Excuse me. 
 Darren Cardiff. 
 Thumb tack man. 
 I started removing the tacks, then got pulled into a critical case, handed it off to a nurse. 
 And why did you not call for a trauma consult? 
 The wounds are all shallow. I'm sealing it with surgical glue. 
 On whose authority? You are an intern. 
 Did you even check a chest X-ray for a pneumo, maybe? 
 Dude didn't want stitches, Doctor, so I suggested another way. 
 The E.R. uses consultants for a reason, Dr. Rivera. 
 41 puncture wounds is a trauma. 
 Next time, call me instead of asking a nurse, or I will note it in your resident file. 
 Frankie's bleeding has stopped, but his BP is still dropping. 
 He's in shock. We need that match. 
 Any luck finding the birth mother? 
 No. Francis said he didn't know. 
 He was fuzzy on the whole thing. 
 Couldn't remember her name or the adoption agency. 
 How do you forget where your kid came from? 
 My parents could still tell you the address of their adoption lawyer. 
 Well, exactly, so I spoke to Toph's cousin, and the State has no adoption records for Frankie. 
 He doesn't exist. 
 That's impossible. 
 The courts keep records on everything. 
 I've seen my own adoption records. 
 You know what else is weird? 
 He made me promise not to talk to his wife, didn't want to upset her. 
 Yeah, well, she completely freaked out when we told her that you had found Frankie, tore her stitches. 
 That's a pretty extreme reaction. 
 Yeah, it is. What are you thinking? 
 This isn't passing the sniff test? 
 Something stinks for sure. 
 My gut's telling me to keep asking questions. 
 I'd start with the mother. 
 [Monitor beeps steadily] 
 Joan? 
 It's Dr. Callahan. 
 Frankie needs your help. 
 Is Frankie going to die? 
 Well, he's very sick. 
 He needs a bone marrow transplant. 
 We need to find his birth family. 
 There's no record of his adoption anywhere. 
 Can you tell me why? 
 I'm so sorry. 
 Hey. 
 We all make mistakes. 
 Usually, it's just we have to deal with them, but I don't care what you did back then. 
 I just care what you do now. 
 I'd trade my life for his. 
 Then tell me about Frankie, Joan. 
 I was always meant to be a mother, but God wouldn't give me a baby. 
 And then one day, we were coming out of the movie theater, and there was Frankie in a stroller. 
 And he smiled at me. 
 And I just knew, in my heart, he was mine. 
 Where did "God" give Frankie to you, Joan? 
 In a mall... in Austin. 
 [Sobs] 
 I mean, I-I thought it was just TC being TC, but he was right and he found the truth. 
 Chicago PD contacted the birth parents, Rick and Lisa Moran. 
 They moved to Chicago last year, and the son's case went cold. 
 Well, memories of their loss everywhere, who could blame them? 
 Yeah, they're on a plane right now from O'Hare. 
 That's three hours away. He won't make it that long. 
 [Gasps] Fetal cord blood. 
 We were gonna save it, remember? 
 Maybe Frankie's birth parents saved his. 
 They're on a plane right now. We can't reach 'em. 
 We don't have to. There's a cryo bank in Austin where Frankie was stolen. I'll call. 
 Fetal cord blood... good call, Jordan. 
 Yeah, we always said it would come in handy. Looks like it did. 
 Yeah. 
 I shouldn't have said that. I'm sorry. 
 Ah. 
 I got to check on a patient. Excuse me. 
 Miss Martinez, I owe you an apology. 
 I had no right to talk to you like that. 
 No. You're right. 
 My dad and I would never talk. 
 My mom died when I was little. It was just me and my dad. 
 He worked so hard so I could have everything I needed. 
 And you worked hard so he could stop. 
 Made partner, bought a house in Alamo Heights, asked him to move in, but he wouldn't give up that ratty trailer at that ranch. 
 No matter what I do, he still cares more about his horses than me. 
 I don't think that's true. 
 [Sighs] I'm a lot like your dad. 
 You know, I work so I can avoid things, feel like I'm in control. 
 That's why he won't leave the ranch, and why you are in the office until 1:00 a.m. 
 [Monitor beeps] 
 What's happening?! 
 His heart rate's in his 30s. 
 Papi! Be careful with my papi, please. 
 We tried pacing him, but we're not getting much capture. 
 What did his labs say? 
 I reviewed everything. 
 Those fractures were the only abnormality. 
 [Beeping continues] 
 I got it. 
 Okay. Uh... 
 There it is, a healed fracture of the hyoid bone. 
 Dr. Rivera. 
 His throat injury, plus bradycardia, plus hypothermia adds up to hypothyroidism. 
 He's in a myxedema coma. 
 Let's give him 500 micrograms of synthroid IV. 
 We're gonna jump-start his thyroid. 
 [Flatline] 
 Okay, he's lost his pulse. 
 Let's start CPR. 
 [Monitor beeping rapidly] 
 Come on, Mr. Martinez. 
 Kenny? Admin papers for Trauma 2. 
 Yeah, great. 
 Yo, yo, y-you got the T900. 
 That thing's banging, right? 
 I just got it. [Scoffs] 
 I like my old one better. 
 You  just  got it? 
 Yeah. 
 From Topher. 
 Oh! [Scoffs] 
 Tough night. 
 Mind if I bum one? 
 [Siren wails] 
 Thank you. 
 You got a light? 
 [Thunder crashes] 
 Thanks. 
 That's nice. 
 [Thunder crashes] 
 [Chuckles] 
 [Sighs] 
 You know, sneaking sodas, Ray the orderly... 
 I get it. We're playing. 
 But smoking, man? Come on, man, it's just wrong. 
 I'm gonna save you the speech, okay? 
 I-I made a promise. I'm just cheating myself. 
 I got small children, remember? 
 Oh, so that means you can act like one? 
 Please, I don't need a drill sergeant, okay? 
 I was a Ranger. 
 I ran 12 miles with a 60-pound pack in 3 hours. 
 Where's that guy now? 
 He's gone! 
 He's eaten up by long hours, small children, a wife who's pissed because my mom's visiting for a month. 
 All that will kill me long before this does. 
 Two down. 
 All right, we take 24. 
 You guys take 17. 
 You're a grown man. 
 If you want to quit, quit. 
 I don't need you giving me crap. 
 [Siren wails] 
 That's the kid's fetal cord blood. 
 They flew it in from Austin. 
 TC found it? 
 No quit in him. 
 Enjoy your butt. 
 Smoke it. What does he know? 
 She should be able to walk in about a week or so. 
 I need you to give her the antibiotics three times a day when you change the dressing. 
 You remember how? 
 Yes. 
 Uh, I am like a doctor now. 
 Whoa, pump the brakes there, Omed. 
 Just... take care of her. 
 She needs you now more than ever. 
 As-salaamu alaykum, Sharbat. 
 Wa alaykum as-salaam. Thank you both. 
 There you go. 
 Man : Let's go, boys! Move it out! 
 So, they found a safe house in Kabul? 
 Then they got to walk across the Pakistan border, take a bus to Karachi, fly to Jakarta, and sail to Christmas Island. 
 Wow. Think they'll make it? 
 They have a chance. They didn't before. 
 What made you change your mind? 
 [Chuckles] Riley. 
 I thought, what if she were in trouble like Sharbat? 
 I would want someone to help her. 
 Someone who did it because it was the right thing to do. 
 Major. Captain. 
 General Rozenfeld wants to see you. 
 We just got out of surgery. We need to change and shower. 
 Sorry, he said now. 
 Gen. Rozenfeld : You had strict orders not to meddle in local medical matters. 
 Her husband wanted to take her to a midwife. 
 Instead, you performed a C-section. 
 Sir, in the Captain's defense, we were doing our job. 
 That job has changed, Major. 
 You of all people should know that. 
 With all due respect, sir, our partner nearly killed his wife and baby simply because he didn't want to be embarrassed. 
 Crap. 
 Look, I know this place is jacked. 
 Hell, I even respect what you did. 
 But the Afghanis want your head on a stick. 
 I have no choice. 
 Captain Alister, your tour is over. 
 Sir, I have three months left on my tour. 
 You  had  three months. You'll be stateside next week. 
 As for you, Major. 
 With the Captain gone, we're grossly understaffed. 
 Which means, while he's back in Texas enjoying barbecue, your tour is extended another three months. 
 Dismissed. 
 You paged me for a consult. 
 Oh, right this way. 
 We have a patient with massive cranial swelling. 
 Cerebral thrombosis. 
 Well, we checked that. 
 This guy's head literally blew up for no reason. 
 Can you explain it, Doctor? 
 Because we lowly nurses sure as hell can't. 
 Hilarious, Kenny. 
 [Laughter] 
 Pulse and blood pressure are up. 
 Thank you. 
 Dr. Alexander... and I'm... I'm sorry I took my issues out on you. 
 Ah. Heat of the battle. 
 [Chuckles] 
 Welcome back, papi. [Chuckles] 
 Carolina. 
 You're here. 
 And so are you. 
 Thanks to them. 
 ¿Como estas, Señor Martinez? 
 Tired. 
 [Chuckles] 
 But my susto is gone. 
 Mm. Well, if you want it to stay that way, you're gonna need some strong medicine. 
 And... you might not like it. 
 Whatever you say... curandera. 
 Move in with your daughter. 
 Let her take care of you, see you eat right, take your synthroid. 
 Add years to your life. 
 'Cause if you don't, your susto might just come back. 
 Oh, papi! 
 You went from Dr. No to Dr. Phil. 
 What happened? 
 Stopped taking my own advice. 
 Can I do that, too? 
 No. 
 In fact, you and I need to chat about some ground rules. 
 Over tequila later. 
 Oh, okay, well, I'm down with that. 
 All right, get out of here, go do something. 
 Okay, good. 
 How long have you been in Chicago? 
 Um, we moved last year. 
 When the case went cold. I mean, it was so hard to go. 
 Harder to stay. 
 I can't imagine what you both have been through. 
 But you kept paying to store the cord blood. 
 Good call. 
 I mean, we had to. 
 It was all we had left of him besides Fufu. 
 [Monitor beeping] 
 It's still very early, but the transfusion has been bringing his fever down. 
 Frankie? 
 Hey, Frankie. 
 My name is Dr. Scott. 
 You were in an accident, but you're okay now. 
 I want my mommy. 
 Fufu? 
 [Chuckles] 
 He's missed you so much. 
 I missed you, Fufu. 
 [Laughing emotionally] 
 [Police radio chatter] 
 What about Joan? 
 She's still in the ICU. 
 Guess they were so desperate to have kids that they stole one. 
 So twisted, huh? 
 [Scoffing] Yeah. 
 Hey, how'd that myxedema case of yours turn out? 
 Oh, we got him back. Daughter's not suing. 
 How did you pull that off? 
 [Chuckles] Well, she's not a bitch or anything. 
 She just, you know, was trying to take control of a situation that she felt was out of her hands, which I get. 
 I spent my whole life trying to plan every little thing. 
 Saying no to anything that I couldn't control, not letting myself make any mistakes. 
 After the baby and everything, I've been even more like that. 
 Well, you're just keeping your eyes on the prize. 
 What prize... more work? 
 Feeling like yourself again. 
 You'll get there. 
 Well, I know one thing. I'm done with no. 
 I want to see where yes gets me. 
 You know where yes got me. AA. 
 If I leave now, I can still make a meeting before all the doughnuts are gone. 
 Live and learn, Dr. Clemmens. 
 How I roll. 
 See you tomorrow. 
 All right. 
 Yeah. 
 Long night. 
 Now I need a drink. 
 But I can't with Annie around. 
 Hey, how about a run, blow off some steam? 
 A run? You? 
 I don't know. This is the new me. Annie was the old me. 
 I'm thinking of a 5K this year. 
 You want to be my training partner? 
 You mean kick your butt in a race? 
 Those are betting words, pal. 
 Yeah. 
 We okay, Dr. Cummings? 
 You tell me. 
 Look, we're family here. 
 We may mess with you sometimes, but we'll always have your back. 
 Just don't be an ass. 
 Lesson learned. 
 All right, thanks. Okay. 
 _ 
 [Scoffs] Amateur. 
 Hey, just the man I was looking for. 
 I like the sound of that. 
 I got into Georgetown. They just e-mailed me. 
 Somebody dropped out, I'm off the wait list. 
 You got into Georgetown? 
 Yes, I got into Georgetown. 
 You got into Georgetown! Yes! That's amazing! 
 That's amazing! 
 We're gonna celebrate all summer. 
 Where you wanna go? 
 I got to talk to you about that. 
 I got to leave tomorrow. 
 What? 
 Yeah, I'll... I'll tell you a little bit more about it when I get back, okay? 
 I'm gonna see you on Thursday. 
 All right. 
 I'm sorry I won't... I won't be able to be there for your birthday. 
 I didn't think you'd make it anyway. 
 It's okay. Is that... is that Riley? Oh. Honey, this is Drew, who I was telling you about. Hey. I just wanted to tell you that your mom did something really amazing today. She was awesome. You would have been really proud of her. I was. Hey, Mom, I gotta go. Lexi and I are trying on bridesmaid dresses. Bridesmaids? Who's getting married? Lexi and dad. What? They got engaged a few weeks ago. He didn't tell you. Oh! Oh, right, right. Anyway, I gotta go. Bye. Wait. 24! She's beautiful, Syd. Thanks. I... I got her a soccer ball sewn at a girls school in Kabul. It was a birthday present. Since you're going back, can you take it to her? Sure, yeah, no, I'd be more than happy to. Syd, I-I don't even... Drew, stop apologizing. This is what I signed up for. It may not be what Riley signed up for, but hey, what can I do about that? Get hammered on near beer? [Scoffs] I'm buying. Tempting. Rain check? Yeah, of course. Good night, Major. Good night, Captain. ["I of the Storm" by Of Monsters and Men playing] So, the staring at Jordan and Scott earlier. Was that wistful memories or painful future? I don't know. After everything we've been through, nothing's easy anymore. Never is with you two. Meantime, if I were you, I'd start building up those chicken legs before someone tries to barbecue them. Get some sun on 'em. It's summertime! All right, enough talking. Let's go, old man. Come on. Come on! Okay, that's... that's... Yeah, I'll catch up! Shannon, you don't have all the answers, okay? You're still an intern, and you're gonna make mistakes, but it's how you learn. So, just every once in a while, maybe stop talking and listen a little bit. Tell you what, you help me work on my work game, and I'll help you work on your off-duty game. I don't know. I'm just... I'm not good at that stuff. All right? I'm not really big on hooking up. Oh, wow, Sam's here. The station's two blocks away. They usually sit at the counter, but making mistakes is how you learn, right? Don't call him over here. Hey! I am gonna kill you. Jonah! Sam! Oh, my God. Well, at least I'll have two firemen to rescue me. [Laughs] Hey. Hey, guys, what's up? Uh, breakfast. You want some company? Yes. Okay. [Sighs] Hey. We're gonna need another round. Yeah, we're thirsty. Can I get a shot of tequila, please? Ooh! Four shots. Four shots of tequila. ♪ I feel it break my skin ♪ Oh. You... Sorry, I touched it. [Chuckling] Go for it. It's Annie, right? Yeah, good memory. It's Scott. Scott, right. So that  was  you that I saw earlier at the hospital. Yeah, you should have said hi. Next time I will. Why don't you take a few days off and come with me? I'll show you the best crab shack in Maryland. We can drive down to Ocean City, see Assateague Island. I got my gym opening this week. I got my life savings in that thing, you know that? Yeah, I know, it's just... we knew this was gonna be hard if I got in. Yeah, well, a few hours ago, I thought that'd be next year, not right now. Okay, so fly out after things settle down with the gym. Things settle down, I'm going belly up. I mean, it's just me doing it all right now. Maybe you could come back. Ah, I don't know. I got to come out of the gate strong or I'm gonna get buried. [Chuckles] Long-distance thing never works out, huh?
