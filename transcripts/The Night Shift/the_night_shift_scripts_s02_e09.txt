 Hey Kenny, you got a minute? 
 Yeah, sure, what's... up? 
 Good talk, bad talk? 
 [Laughs] 
 You're... you're not in trouble. 
 We all know you've been asking for more responsibility, and Topher could use some help running the shift, so he can see more patients. 
 You're a hard worker and... maybe you play too many practical jokes, but you have the respect of the staff, and everybody likes you. 
 Uh, I don't know about everybody. 
 Except him. 
 Anyway, we got the budget 
 [Siren wails begin] for a charge nurse position. 
 So, if you want the gig... 
 [Siren wails end] 
 Are you kidding me? Yeah... yeah, I want it. 
 All right. 
 When... when would I start? 
 Uh, right now. 
 Male, 50, single stab wound to the upper right arm. 
 He's tachy to the 120s, but overall, vitals are stable. 
 Second gurney behind me. 
 Okay, what happened, sir? 
 His daughter did this. 
 No. No, she didn't. 
 It was an accident. I fell. 
 Hey, Ragosa, you're with T.C. in Trauma 2. 
 I'm on it. 
 [Amanda screaming] 
 What have we got? 
 Don't touch me! Stay away from me! 
 Female, 20 years old, laceration to the left cheek. 
 Ugh! 
 She's delusional with auditory hallucinations. 
 Okay, hold on, I'll look. 
 Ah, you're monsters! Stay away from me! 
 Ma'am... 
 Hey! 
 Don't touch me! 
 No biting. 
 I'll kill you! 
 Push 5 of Haldol, I.V. 
 [Grunting] 
 T.C. : Good news. 
 [Groans] 
 Wound is superficial. 
 [Groans] 
 [Sighs] We'll suture you right up. 
 You'll be good as new. 
 Ragosa, what would you do next? 
 I irrigate, you numb the wound. 
 Mm-hmm. 
 There was an... there was an officer that came with the paramedics. 
 Can you do me a favor? 
 Just tell him that my daughter had nothing to do with this. 
 Pretty hard to fall on a knife. 
 Come on. 
 Don't worry. You can trust me. 
 Look, I don't know. 
 Amanda's just spiraled all day until she finally just snapped. 
 I just... I just... I just wanted to calm her down, so I grabbed her arm, and she thought I was trying to kill her, so she stabbed me. 
 So I slapped her, and she hit her head off the counter. 
 [Sighs] 
 I just... I just can't believe I hit my daughter. 
 Sounds like self-defense to me. 
 Dr. Callahan is right. 
 If you wouldn't have stopped her, you would've come in here D.O.A. 
 Hmm? Don't be so hard on yourself. 
 I don't know. It's been six years. 
 Nothing's changed. 
 We've been to every psychiatrist here in San Antonio. 
 They say she's got bipolar disorder, delusional disorder. 
 There's so many disorders, I don't even know how to keep track. 
 I'll bet she's on a million different meds, too, huh? 
 Yeah. You name it, she's been on it. 
 Nothing works. 
 Shrink says I should put her in an institution, but she's my little girl. 
 I can't do that. 
 I'm not giving up on her. 
 [Monitor beeping steadily] 
 Can I help you, Officer? 
 This girl attacked her Dad. She's out of her mind. 
 She kicked me in the head when I was helping the medics. 
 Okay, uh, Heather, can you get the officer an ice pack, please? 
 Sure. 
 Thank you. 
 Is she under arrest? 
 Dad doesn't want to press charges, but it may not be his call. 
 You think she's really nutso? 
 Well, I'm not aware of "nutso" as a technical diagnosis, but she does seem to be experiencing some kind of psychosis. 
 People also like to fake crazy, so they go to the hospital instead of jail. 
 Thanks for the hot tip, but she has legitimate injuries. 
 We'll let you know when she's done. 
 Fine by me. Thanks. 
 I got plenty of paperwork back at the station, but when I come back here, I'm either taking her to jail or the nuthouse. 
 Colonel : Attention to orders. 
 The secretary of the army has reposed special trust and confidence in the patriotism... 
 Thanks for inviting me. 
 I've never been to a promotion ceremony. 
 It's so exciting. 
 Drew : Army promotions are a lot tamer at home. 
 If we were on deployment, my buddy Javy would be running into the mud getting punched in the chest by every NCO in his battalion. 
 [Chuckles] 
 Well, let me know when you get promoted 
 'cause I got a great right hook... 
 2015. 
 Javier Luis Castro is therefore advanced from Sergeant to Staff Sergeant. 
 [Cheers and applause] 
 Javy! 
 Whoo! 
 Congratulations. 
 Thank you, sir. 
 [Cheers and applause] 
 Drew : Yeah, baby! 
 Smile for that picture! 
 ♪♪♪ 
 Staff Sergeant, congratulations again. 
 Thank you, sir. 
 I was just telling Captain Alister and his lovely friend here you guys have a long career in the army. 
 I hope you enjoy your work as much as I do. 
 Congratulations, again. 
 Thank you. 
 You guys have a good evening. 
 Thank you, sir. 
 Thanks for coming, man. 
 [Laughs] Wouldn't miss it. Are you kidding me? 
 So, where's the kids? 
 Oh, they're with Javy's parents. We booked a hotel downtown for the night, a little romantic staycation. 
 I'll probably pass out in front of the TV. 
 Sergeant romance over here. 
 [Chuckles] Right. Uh, sorry. 
 Yeah, this is Krista. 
 Good to meet you. 
 This is Javy... 
 Good to meet you, too. 
 ... and his fantastic wife that he does not deserve, Gina. 
 Hi. 
 Hey. 
 You hungry? 
 Yes. Let's eat. 
 Mmm, come here. 
 Bye. 
 Krista's definitely a girl, right? 
 She's not one of those trans... 
 What is wrong with you? 
 I'm just asking, man. 
 I'm just... You know, the world's a complicated place these days. 
 Screw you, Lee. 
 Man : Colonel! 
 Gun! 
 [All screaming] 
 Everybody down! 
 Javier : Gina! 
 Get the gun! 
 Gina! 
 Drew! 
 Help me! 
 ♪ [Theme music] ♪ 
 Javier : Gina! No, baby, no. No. 
 Drew : You got him? 
 Yeah, yeah, yeah. 
 Hold on for me, Gina. Come on, baby. Hold on. 
 Somebody call an ambulance! 
 My God, she's losing a lot of blood, man. 
 Yeah, blood and artery. 
 Gina. 
 Gina, stay with me, baby. Come on. 
 What do you got, Krista? 
 GSW to chest and neck. 
 So far, only mild respiratory distress. 
 I'm putting pressure on the neck wound, but I... I need internal pressure right on the artery, or he's gonna bleed out. 
 Hey, sir, do you self-cath? 
 Yeah. 
 I need an unused Foley catheter. 
 Yeah, I got one. 
 Javy, go grab that. 
 Javy, grab that, give it to Krista. 
 I got my hands full. 
 Okay, so, Krista, what you're gonna... 
 Yeah, insert the tube in the colonel's neck, inflate the balloon, stop the bleeding... I... I'm on it. 
 Drew, what's happening to her? 
 Yeah got her, Javy. I got my finger on the artery. 
 I need you to go out, direct the paramedics back here when they get here. 
 Go! 
 How's that going, Krista? 
 It's in. 
 Good. 
 It's working. 
 Great. We really gotta get these two to the hospital. 
 In. 
 [Inhales] 
 And out. 
 [Coughs] 
 Hello, everyone. I'm Dr. Alexander. 
 So, I understand that Marcus has cystic fibrosis. 
 We like to call it "65 roses." You know why? 
 Uh, 'cause when it was first diagnosed, most kids couldn't pronounce it, so the nickname took off. 
 He's, like, the only doctor who's known that. 
 Totally cool. 
 Well... as you can see, you are in excellent hands with Dr. Cummings. 
 Uh, so it sounds like Marcus has... pneumonia. Third time this year. 
 We just moved here from Dallas. 
 These are his records from the children's hospital. 
 Pseudomonas... treated with a week of I.V. gentamicin. 
 Streptococcus... treated with oral Augmentin, which gave him diarrhea, so that antibiotic's a big fail. 
 His stomach is already a big mess from the mucus buildup, so start him on cefepime... 
 1 gram every 8 hours until his sputum culture is back. 
 My mom's not being rude. She's just efficient. 
 That's... impressive. And it's good that your mom knows her stuff. 
 It makes our job a lot easier. 
 So, Dr. Cummings, what would you suggest? 
 Yeah, actually, I... what she... what she said. 
 Also, I would order a chest X-ray and set him up for breathing treatments. 
 Excellent. I'll leave you to it. 
 It was nice to meet you both. 
 You too. 
 Okay, I'll get you started, all right? 
 [Coughs] 
 [Monitor beeping steadily] 
 Amanda, I'm Dr. Zia. 
 This is Dr. Callahan. How you feeling? 
 My head's still fuzzy. 
 Oh, God, Dad. Did I do that? 
 It's all right, honey. It's okay. 
 Don't worry about me. 
 I'm so, so sorry. 
 I don't know what's happening to me. I've been so much better lately. 
 I enrolled in a couple of college classes. 
 I thought my meds were starting to work. 
 Listen, uh, can we remove these restraints? I mean, I think she's calm now. 
 Yeah, I think we can remove them. 
 Sure Ow. My back really hurts. 
 Yeah, yeah, that's because the police tackled you to the ground, honey. 
 No, it's that same pain. 
 My back. My stomach. They're killing me. 
 The same pain? 
 Yeah, yeah, she complains about this a lot, but doctors say it's psychosomatic. 
 [Groaning] Why doesn't anybody believe me? 
 It really hurts. All the time, I swear. 
 By any chance, are you menstruating? 
 Yeah, but I know what cramps feel like. This is different. 
 Aah! [Breathing rapidly] 
 Oooh. 
 Frank : She does this a few times a week exactly like this. 
 Let's get her 5 of morphine. 
 Toph. Stomach pain, back pain... could be appendicitis or pancreatitis. 
 Maybe a kidney stones or ovarian cyst. 
 Let's do a pelvic ultrasound and an abdominal C.T. 
 Yeah, yeah. 
 Hey, you think this pain's real? 
 We're not sure. 
 Amanda : It is real. 
 We're gonna find out. 
 Frank : Okay. 
 It's all right. There you go. 
 You can't do this to my daughter. 
 Her birthday is in two days. 
 I'll, uh... I'll pay it off in installments. 
 Please, I'm... I'm begging you. 
 Damn it! 
 I'm sorry. 
 It's okay. I was just... 
 I was just passing through. 
 [Laughs] 
 I just, um... I just lost the venue for my daughter's quinceañera. 
 Yeah. Oh. 
 It's just with the, uh, divorce and pay cut, man, it all adds up. 
 And I just maxed out all my credit cards. 
 [Sighs] 
 Her birthday is in two days. 
 If I don't find a place for her to have this party, my daughter's gonna be crushed and my ex-wife will kill me. 
 Michael, I'm sorry. That's awful. 
 Well, hey, look... is there anything I can do? 
 No, but thank you. 
 I got myself into this. 
 [Siren wailing] 
 I'll get myself out. 
 Man : Incoming. 
 Hey, what the hell happened, man? 
 Shooter at the ceremony. This is my friend, Gina. 
 All right. Take her to Trauma 2. 
 GSW to the parietal scalp. 
 Hypotensive from blood loss. 
 I've got my finger on a pumping scalp artery. 
 GCS is 453. Make sure you get T.C. 
 All right. Will do. Will do. 
 Just stay awake, baby. Stay with me. Please. 
 You've got to keep calm for her, Javy. 
 That's my wife! Don't tell me to calm down, man! 
 Hey, hey, sir, sir. Right here, right here. 
 I know this is a terrible situation, but you're not helping your wife, all right? 
 So let Dr. Alister work. 
 It's the best thing you can do. 
 Save her, Drew! Please! 
 Krista : I got the colonel. 
 All right, what do we got? 
 GSW to the chest with a complete heart block. 
 The bullet must've injured his atrioventricular node. 
 He needs a pacemaker. I need Scott. 
 Uh, he's not working tonight. Uh, go up to surgery. 
 I'll page the on-call surgeon. 
 All right. 
 [Monitor beeping steadily] 
 I'm gonna need another 2-0 Prolene. 
 B.P.'s down to 76 systolic. 
 [Door opens] 
 Hey. What's going on? 
 [Sighs] GSW to the scalp. 
 Just grazed her, but nicked an artery. 
 Yeah. A purse string usually does the trick. 
 Okay, I thought so. 
 I just want to make sure I didn't miss anything. 
 Drew, you got this. 
 Just keep doing what you're doing. 
 I'm across the way if you need me. Okay. 
 Let's cross and type for four and get two units on the rapid infuser. 
 I'm on it. 
 Got it right here. 
 [Gina whimpers] 
 Say, Kenny... 
 Yo. 
 Hey, Gina. I'm Kenny. 
 I got shot in the head? Oh, God, I got shot. 
 Gina, it's okay. We're fixing you right up. 
 Okay, Gina, let's keep those eyes on me. 
 Good, good. Let's take deep breaths. 
 [Inhales deeply] 
 Yeah, here we go, let's take deep breaths. 
 [Exhales deeply] 
 Hey, how about we take a little quiz? 
 Huh, a fun, little quiz? 
 Now, which do you think is bigger? 
 Russia or Pluto? 
 I don't know. Pluto. 
 I know, that's the thing, right? You'd think. 
 But it's Russia. [Chuckles] 
 No wonder Plutoâs not a planet anymore. 
 We kicked its puny, little ass out of the solar system. 
 [Laughs] 
 We want real planets up in here. 
 [Laughs] 
 Amanda : They're trying to kill me! 
 Stay back! You're the devil! 
 What are you doing? 
 Let's just take it easy! Please! Please! 
 You're trying to control my brain! 
 Stay back! 
 Let's just take it easy. 
 Get out! No, aah! 
 Don't hurt her, please! 
 Aah! 
 Wait, what's happening to her? She's not breathing. 
 Get me a crash cart! 
 Oh, hold the intubation. 
 Her respirations are back to normal. 
 Okay, wh... what happened to her? 
 [Sighs] We don't know. 
 Heather, she's still out. 
 Let's keep her on high-flow oxygen. 
 Sure. 
 Wait, she got you good. Let me... let me clean that up. 
 Thanks. 
 Hey. Hey, uh, I'm really sorry about that, okay? 
 Don't worry about it. Happens almost every other night. 
 'Cause I feel like my daughter is dying right in front of me, and... and no one can do anything to... to stop it! 
 Frank, Frank. 
 That's what I feel. 
 Frank, the more physical symptoms, the more pieces we have of the puzzle. 
 Okay, if we can pinpoint the cause, then we can cure her. 
 [Monitor beeping rapidly] 
 What the hell is that? 
 She's seizing. 
 What do you mean "she's seizing"? What are you talking about?! What do you mean? 
 Kenny, could you take Frank to the waiting room? 
 No, no, I want to stay with her. 
 Now! 
 No! Let me stay with her! 
 Let me stay here. 
 Go to the waiting room now! 
 The meds are in, but she's not slowing down. 
 Okay, load a gram of Dilantin. 
 Topher : Tee, what the hell? 
 I don't know, Toph. I don't know. 
 Blow on that for me, okay? 
 [Exhaling] 
 [Monitor beeping steadily] 
 His temp and respiratory rates are... are going up. 
 [Coughing] 
 It's because it's not working. 
 He's not responding to the cefepime. 
 This happens sometimes. 
 You can't quit the game because I'm kicking your butt. 
 One second, honey. 
 Listen, has he ever gotten a nebulized antibiotic? 
 The, uh, the medicine will go directly to his lungs. 
 Yeah, good luck. 
 You have to submit paperwork to medicaid for approval. 
 Other hospitals have tried. They all fail. 
 Right. 
 We do things a bit different around here, okay? 
 So, yeah. 
 Hey, uh, Marcus, watch out for her knight. 
 Okay, she's baiting you. 
 Dude, I'm baiting her. 
 Don't give up my strategy. 
 Okay. 
 It's my turn? 
 Naomi : Dad! 
 Naomi? 
 Lydia, what... 
 Is it true that we're not having my birthday party? 
 Lydia : This is unbelievable, Michael. 
 You said you took care of it. 
 Can we talk about this in private, please? 
 Jocelyn : Poor Michael. He's in deep. 
 Yeah, I, uh... I heard that Naomi's birthday party got canceled. 
 Not just any birthday... her quinceañera. 
 That's like a... it's like a sweet sixteen, right? 
 Sweet sixteen on steroids. 
 You learn a bunch of dances, put on a show for your guests, do a father/daughter dance. 
 It's a milestone in a Latina's life. 
 It's one of the best days of my life. 
 Really, Lydia? You had to come down here, huh? 
 Because you didn't answer your phone. 
 Because I am working. 
 The hotel manager called and said we had pick up all the decorations. 
 [Sniffles] I just wish you would've told me. 
 I'm sorry, bug. I was trying to fix it first. 
 But look, I'm... I'm gonna make it up to you, okay? 
 We'll have the party in a few months after I save up some money. 
 You knew you couldn't afford it. Why did you pretend? 
 Because I underestimated expenses, okay? 
 Listen, Naomi. [Sighs] 
 Money's a little tight right now. 
 I... I screwed up. I know. I'm so, so sorry. 
 Then you can call everyone and tell them it's canceled and why. 
 I'm not taking crap for this. It's on you. 
 I can't believe this. 
 Wha... honey! 
 C... come... 
 I'm so sorry. 
 Naomi! 
 So, how you feeling? 
 I have an epic headache. 
 [Laughs] I would think so. 
 You just had a bullet bounce off your head. 
 Actually, I've been having these headaches for a few weeks. 
 For a few weeks? 
 I have been stressed out, waiting to hear if Javy was gonna get promoted. 
 I thought maybe that was the reason. 
 Okay. Keep an eye on it. 
 Baby. 
 You're okay. 
 Yeah. I'm just a little shaken up. 
 Did you check on the kids? 
 Yeah. Talked to my dad. 
 Kids are asleep. They're fine. You... you need anything? 
 No, I just have a headache. 
 I'm gonna talk to Drew. 
 Drew? 
 Hmm? 
 Man, I'm sorry for yelling at you, dude. 
 Yeah, it hurt my feelings. [Laughs] 
 It did? 
 That's why I'm telling you I'm sorry. 
 It's okay. 
 But, uh, I heard the shooter was, uh, the colonel's brother-in-law. 
 Yeah. Apparently, he was pissed because the colonel wouldn't co-sign for him on some business loan. 
 He just lost it. 
 So, the man does four tours in war zones and the first time he gets shot, it's by his brother-in-law over a business loan? 
 Yeah. 
 Are you... 
 What the hell's wrong with people? 
 I know, right. 
 Hey, Gina. 
 Javy. 
 Hey. 
 Hey. Um... 
 Yeah, yeah, yeah. 
 So, I just finished with the colonel. He's in recovery. He wants to see you. 
 But I need to show you something first. 
 Yeah, sure. 
 Ah, damn. 
 Yeah. 
 What? Is that Gina's X-ray? 
 It's her C.T. 
 When you use that tone, man... 
 I know. Just... here, let me show you both something. 
 Hey. 
 So, Gina, you have something called an arteriovenous malformation in your brain. 
 It's an... 
 It's an AVM. 
 It's a huge spider web of tangled veins and arteries. 
 It's what's causing your headaches. 
 Krista, did you already call neurosurge? 
 Yes, I let them know we need a stat AVM resection. 
 I... I'll make sure the O.R. is prepped. 
 What? Oh, my God. 
 Drew, my head, it hurts. 
 Yeah, we're gonna take care of this right now. Okay, I promise you. 
 Hold on. I don't understand what happened. 
 She may have had the AVM since birth, but the force of the bullet hitting her skull caused it to bleed. 
 Her brain is bleeding? 
 Yeah, and we gotta get it out before it ruptures. We got to go. Now. 
 [Crying] What? What? No. 
 Okay, I love you. All right. I love you. 
 Baby, I love you. 
 She's my world. You make sure they fix it. 
 I know. 
 Fix her, Drew. Fix her. 
 Hey. 
 Are you all right? 
 No. 
 My kid's completely destroyed, and it's all my fault. 
 Well, I... I don't know what it's like to be a parent, but, um, I do know what it's like to be a daughter. 
 And she's angry with you now, but it's just a blip in the big picture. 
 [Sighs] 
 Jordan, let me give you a little heads-up about being a parent. 
 Your child's happiness and well-being is all you think about. 
 [Sighs] 
 No matter what you're doing, no matter what's happening in your day or at your job. 
 Did they eat right? What's happening at school? 
 It's like a continuous soundtrack running through your head. 
 So... all the time. 
 Yeah, all the time. 
 This party meant everything to Naomi, and I let her down. 
 She'll forgive me, but she'll never forget. 
 And neither will I. 
 [Elevator bell dings] 
 Paul : Hey, Jordan. 
 Yeah. 
 Hey, uh, Marcus isn't responding to cefepime. 
 He needs nebulized antibiotics. 
 Is there any way he can get them before he submits to medicaid? 
 Man, those medications are pretty expensive. 
 Uh, medicaid probably won't reimburse, and there's no way the administration will approve of them. 
 Okay, then I'll pay for 'em. 
 If you pay for every drug that's not covered by insurance, you'll be broke in a week. 
 Okay, then I'll... I'll worry about that next week. 
 Paul, come on. 
 Look, you have a big heart, and I like that about you. 
 But we need to be realistic about what we can and cannot do, all right? 
 All right, I will try and fast-track the paperwork on the medication, but it could still take a month. 
 All right, so for now, add on an I.V. aminoglycoside. 
 All right, that might work. 
 Okay, but, uh, this sucks. 
 Yeah, it does. 
 Hey. She really did get you. 
 You're lucky she didn't break your nose. 
 [Sighs] I kind of miss a good punch to the face. 
 You looking at Amanda's new labs? 
 Yes. Give me a list of symptoms. 
 Uh, seizures, respiratory paralysis, stomach pains, back pains, skin lesions, paranoia, hallucinations. 
 Could it be autoimmune hepatitis? 
 We did a full immunity work-up. 
 Autoantibodies were normal. 
 This is so frustrating. 
 Yeah. 
 Her father must feel so helpless. 
 Yeah, I'm not looking forward to this part of parenthood, by the way. 
 Hey, we're doctors. 
 We'll be more in control of medical emergencies. 
 Yeah, you keep telling yourself that. 
 You have no control. 
 My daughter sneezes, I get a chill up my spine. 
 Yeah, but you're weird. 
 [Laughs] 
 Kenny : Hey, guys. Hey, the arresting officer just called. 
 He wants to take her into custody. I tried stalling him, but he's heading over. 
 That sucks. We can delay him a bit, but if she wakes up and starts flipping out again, she's off to the psych ward. 
 You know what? When the cop gets here, let me deal with him. 
 Yeah? How are you gonna do that? 
 Don't you worry about it. I got this. 
 How is Staff Sergeant Castro's wife, Gina, doing? 
 She's still in surgery. We'll know more in a couple of hours. 
 Hey. 
 Colonel. 
 Tell me you beat the hell out of that coward, son-of-a-bitch brother-in-law of mine. 
 I just did what I needed to do, sir. 
 Yeah, there was a lot of people there. You were the only one who acted. 
 Thank you, sir. 
 But we're here to talk about you. 
 Dr. Bell-Hart assisted in your surgery. 
 Right, so, Colonel, the bullet ruptured your heart valve, and we replaced it. 
 But the damage to your heart's electrical system couldn't be repaired, and we had to fit you with a pacemaker. 
 Oh. 
 That's a disability discharge from the army. 
 I'm so sorry, sir. 
 I can talk to the medical evaluation board on your behalf. 
 Maybe we can get a dispensation. 
 This... this doesn't have to mean the end of your career. 
 [Sighs] Could you not do that? 
 Sir? 
 I love the army, Captain, but I gave up everything for it. 
 My marriage fell apart. 
 I wasn't there near as much as I should've been for my sons. 
 It's time to make up for lost time. 
 Getting shot kind of puts thing into... [Coughs] Excuse me. Kind of puts things... [Coughs] 
 [Coughing] 
 Oh, look at his face. It's swelling. 
 He's got hives. 
 Get me EPI and start Solu-Medrol and Benadryl. 
 He's going into anaphylactic shock. 
 To what? He has no allergies. 
 My chest burns. 
 [Coughing] 
 The pacemaker. He's got to be allergic to the cables. 
 I'll call cardiology. 
 No time. 
 We got to take the pacemaker out. 
 Right now? 
 [Breathing rapidly] 
 Now. 
 Okay. 
 We're gonna have to externally pace him to keep him alive. 
 He can't breathe! Help! 
 Help! He can't breathe! 
 He can't breathe! Do something! 
 His... his oxygen level is dropping. I need to put him on a vent. I need a nurse. 
 It's gonna be okay, baby. Shh. It's gonna be okay. Stay with me. 
 I... I got you, on this, okay. I got you, buddy. 
 It's okay. 
 Please. 
 Grab a vent and set up to intubate. 
 Please, Marcus, stay with me. 
 Come on. 
 Marcus. 
 It's going to be okay. 
 
 
 
 Hey, there, Officer. 
 My perp ready to go? 
 Um, I'll check, but I think that she's getting some more tests. 
 But, hey, Officer, you know what? 
 I am so glad that you came back, because, you know, I just couldn't get you out of my mind. 
 Hey, Doc, I'm flattered, but I'm taken. 
 What? No, no, no, no. 
 Um, I'm concerned about the kick to the head. 
 I think you should get a C.T. scan. 
 [Laughs] Seems kind of extreme. 
 Well... 
 Wouldn't it be extreme if you didn't get the scan and you dropped dead from a brain bleed? 
 Uh, yeah. O... okay. 
 But how much is this gonna run me? 
 [Scoffs] Stop it. 
 It's on the house for our boys in blue. 
 Come on. 
 Hey, bud. 
 How's, uh... how's Marcus doing? 
 Uh, terrible. I had to put him on a vent. 
 Damn. 
 Sorry you had to do that, man. 
 Yeah. 
 You should have seen the look on his face when I had to intubate. 
 I mean, the kid's only 9 years old. 
 He's already been through enough pain for a lifetime. 
 It's just not fair. 
 I hear that, man. 
 Sick kids always mess me up, too. 
 Hey, I'll keep good thoughts. 
 [Beep] 
 [Computer beeping] 
 [Beep] 
 [Monitor beeping steadily] 
 You got the meds? 
 Uh, yeah. 
 Yeah, I figured something out. 
 How? Medicaid? 
 Um, no, no, no. 
 The pharmacist actually owed me a favor, uh, so he gave me samples from the drug company. 
 They were... they were free to the hospital, actually, so, um, you know, they're... they're free. 
 [Chuckles] That's unbelievable. 
 [Sighs] 
 Hey, you... you okay? 
 Yeah. Um... 
 I'm not... I'm just not used to people helping me. 
 It's nice to have someone else care for a change. 
 His father... 
 I am... I'm sorry. I shouldn't, um... 
 No, no, no. Um, what? 
 Marcus' dad, he... he bailed when he saw how hard it was to take care of him. 
 He always treated him like he was some sort of cripple. 
 And my kid... he does not need pity and tears. 
 He needs love. 
 Well, it sounds like he gets plenty of that. 
 He does. 
 Anyway... 
 Thank you. 
 Yeah. 
 Yeah. 
 Drew : This patch is cobalt. 
 This one is silicone. 
 [Monitor beeping steadily] 
 You holding up okay? 
 We haven't had a chance to talk about the shooting. 
 Yeah. 
 Honestly... [sighs] 
 Tonight was... just a lot. 
 Life's just so out of our control. 
 Just one accident, one moment, one piece of news. 
 Yeah. 
 And that's why I'm just... I mean, I'm trying to live life in the moment, especially after Rick's accident and the breakup. 
 I'm just trying to take all the hits and bumps, go for a ride, hope for the best. 
 [Both laugh] 
 'Cause, I mean, like you said, it's just out of our control. 
 Drew, look at that patch. 
 He's allergic to cobalt. 
 Yeah. [Sighs] 
 Okay. Now we just got to find a manufacturer who makes a pacemaker without cobalt. 
 Can you start making some phone calls? I want to go check on Gina. 
 Of course, of course. I'll get Ragosa to help. 
 You go. 
 Thank you. 
 So, Doc, I know I said I'm taken, but, uh, my girlfriend and I have been talking about having one of those open relationships. 
 Uh-huh. 
 You know, where you can have s*x with other people. 
 Okay. 
 Because after a while, let's be honest, it gets pretty boring doing the same old... 
 You have to be quiet now, or the scan won't work. 
 Copy that. 
 Okay, don't run the scan, and don't tell anyone, and I will get you the next three weekends off. 
 Deal. 
 All right. 
 Catch you later. 
 Topher : Maybe this is mental illness. 
 Maybe... maybe we're trying to find something that's not there. 
 Toph, both of our guts told us it wasn't psychiatric. 
 Sometimes our guts are wrong. 
 Sometimes that's just us trying to fix something that we know we can't. 
 Nah, I'm not good with "can't." 
 "Can't" is part of the job. 
 Her father said that she's been to every psychiatrist in town. 
 What do we know that they don't? 
 What did we learn in the war? 
 Hmm? 
 To follow your gut. 
 And what happened when we didn't? 
 I know, Tee. 
 Look, Toph. 
 What? 
 Look. 
 Purple pee. 
 Purple pee. 
 G.I. and neuro symptoms, diaphragmatic paralysis. 
 Seizures, skin blisters, menstrual cycle. 
 Purple pee! 
 Purple pee! 
 We got it! 
 Yeah! 
 Kenny : On short notice? 
 You really think you can pull that off? 
 We don't know if we don't try, right? 
 Hey, look, spread the word, okay? 
 Roger that. 
 Hey. 
 I just got an update from O.R. 
 Gina's gonna be in there another hour. 
 But so far, so good. 
 [Sighs] Man, the surgeon told me that if you didn't order that brain scan... 
 That's just my job. 
 It's gonna be okay. 
 [Chuckles] 
 You're my brother, man. 
 You really are. 
 I know. 
 [Sighs] 
 Okay, don't get all gay on me now. 
 Hey, shut up. 
 Your wife is gonna survive. I'm not your type. 
 [Sighs] 
 Whoo! 
 Hey, man, I'm sorry about trying to hook you up with my cousin, too. 
 It was just... 
 I should've asked you, you know, what kind of guys you're into or whatever. 
 I just... 
 I saw you were hurting. 
 I wanted to help. 
 I know. 
 But I'm still not over Rick. 
 And I'm not ready to meet someone else and pretend to care about what school they went to or the names of their sister's kids. 
 I'm still in that 
 "this all really sucks" stage. 
 Man, that's the same relationship crap men and women go through. 
 Yes. 
 It's called being in love. 
 Don't be such a moron. 
 Please. 
 Oh, shut up. 
 [Laughs] 
 [Sighs] 
 Hey, how you doing? 
 Hey. Hey, yeah. 
 It's, uh, just super-hard to find a pacemaker that doesn't have cobalt. 
 No, I mean... I mean, how are you doing? 
 You, uh... you had a crazy-scary night. 
 Yeah, yeah. I just haven't, uh, had much time to process it yet. 
 Just been running around. 
 I just... 
 I just want you to know that I'm really... 
 I'm really glad nothing bad happened to you. 
 And... 
 I hope nothing does happen to you. Um... 
 Look. 
 I'm your friend. 
 If you ever want to talk or grab a beer or whatever, you know, I'm around. 
 Thanks, Kenny. 
 And congrats on your promotion. 
 You're gonna be so great. 
 [Laughs] 
 Damn Skippy. 
 Okay. 
 All right, thank you. Krista, I found it... gold-coated pacemaker, Danish manufacturer. 
 There's a 24-hour warehouse right here in San Antonio. 
 Give it up. Boom! 
 I will be right back. 
 Hey, Paul, how's Marcus doing? 
 Oh, a... a lot better, actually. 
 Uh, but I'm gonna admit him so he can continue getting treatments. 
 So, the aminoglycoside worked? 
 Uh, yeah. 
 Good. 
 Yeah. 
 Sometimes that works. 
 [Clicks tongue] 
 Woman over P.A. System :  Dr. Alexander to radiology. 
 Dr. Alexander to radiology. So, I heard surgery went great. I've had better days. But my kids are gonna love this look. They're gonna call me "mummy." Oh, good, we're making puns. Javier : I've been getting a bunch of texts, man. You're gonna get a commendation for what you did tonight. And you're a star, Drew. You're all over the Internet. Yeah. Show him the video. Oh, yeah, yeah. What video? It's so cool. Your 15 minutes of fame have started, bro. It already has 350,000 views. It's pretty amazing. Crazy, right? So, Amanda has porphyria. It's a disorder that results from a buildup of molecules called porphyrins, in the red blood cells. Okay, so, you're saying that you think this por... disorder is causing this mental... ? Topher : Yeah. Now, it's easily treatable by a high-glucose I.V. And a medication called Hematin, which should work relatively fast. Okay. [Door opens] Hold on one second. Hold on. Let me check a neuro exam. You said the scan was fine. I'm not doing any more tests. I need to bring this woman in now. Miss, I'm gonna read you your rights. Hey, just wait. It's not a mental illness. She's not dangerous. She doesn't have to go to jail. You're sure about this diagnosis, right? Toph? No, no! I'm not a guinea pig! You can't do experiments on me! Oh, my God! She pulled out her I.V. I'll place an E.J. Hold her down. Aah! Okay, the med's all in. Amanda, can you say something? How's your pain? Tell me. Better. A lot better. Okay. [Sighs] Daddy, the pain's going away. Oh, God. Officer : She's like "The Exorcist." [Chuckles] Is this for real? Very. And she's only gonna get better. I... I won't take her in, but I am gonna have to give her a summons to appear in court. What if we testify for her? Case might be dismissed. Count us in. All right. And, uh, Doc, think about what I was saying back there with the, uh... Good night, Officer. Copy that. Topher : Sounds like you took one for the team there, Jordan. Not in the way he wanted to. Hey. I'm Dr. Alexander. I'm glad to see that you're feeling better. Thank you. So, we're gonna prescribe you some medication to keep the disorder in check, and you're gonna have to continue the I.V. treatments for a few days. And... no going in the sun, no smoking, no alcohol, you got that? Whatever you want me to do, I'll do it. Yes. So, you'll only be in the hospital for a day or two, but I will, uh, come and visit, maybe kick your butt in some chess. Bring it on. Okay. [Laughs] And, hey, if you ever need anything while you're here or even after you're discharged, just ask for me, okay? You will skip the line. Whoa. Really? V.I.P. treatment. What's V.I.P.? Uh, that would be very important person, which you are, so... I like that. Yeah. See you later, bud. Bye. That's my number. I don't usually go for doctors. Twisted God complexes. But you are the cutest. Okay. [Chuckles] [Laughs] Here it is. Oh, way to go, Michael. The colonel's already upstairs getting prepped. I'll run this up. Okay. Way to go on the pacemaker. Well, at least I got one thing right tonight. Okay, enough of this pity party out of you. Look, we're all going to dinner later, and you should come. I'm buying. Well, if you're buying, I am in. Good. But I am gonna go home and get some rest first. It's been a long night. Text me where later. Sure. Okay, everybody gather 'round. Listen up, we don't have a lot of time. I know you have all heard about this from either Kenny or me, and you all have your assignments, so we really need to pull together to make this happen, okay? Are you all with me? All : Yes.
