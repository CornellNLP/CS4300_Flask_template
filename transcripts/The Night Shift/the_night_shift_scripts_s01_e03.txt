 ♪ Banging on a floorboard ♪ 
 Kenny : Keep your guard up, Drew! Come on! 
 ♪ 
♪ Why you keep me waitin' so long? ♪ 
 Ooh! 
 Go, Drew! 
 Topher : [Shouts indistinctly] 
 Do the... do the arm with the thing in the... 
 Ohh! 
 ♪ 
 Come on! 
 Already started? What'd I miss? 
 He's eating a lot of punches, but I think we won the first round. 
 So were you with Landry? 
 Define "with." 
 Good God! 
 [Laughs] 
 To be you for one day. 
 ♪ Don't know what life you're living ♪ 
 Yeah! 
 Oh! Oh! Oh! 
 How's Lynn doing? 
 She's not exactly thrilled that her parents are having twins or that her parents are actually having s*x. 
 You have s*x? 
 Not as much as you, but periodically. 
 ♪ 
 [Cheering] Get back in! 
 Get in there, Drew! 
 Krista's really getting into this. Who knew? 
 Come on! Take him down! 
 Man, why... why is this fun? Getting punched is just not fun. 
 Damn, Krista, you this crazy when you're not at work? 
 I'd like to see you on a weekend sometime. 
 Clench! Give him a knee! 
 Dude, you know you have no chance, right? 
 She's so into Drew. 
 ♪ 
 Krista : Ohh! 
 Fight over! Fight over! 
 Ohh! Yeah! Come on! 
 Whoo! Yeah! 
 Someone call a medic! 
 Stay down. Relax. I'm gonna take care of you. 
 I'm a doctor. 
 Possible depressed orbital fracture with inferior rectus entrapment. 
 Set up a trauma panel and facial C.T. 
 Did you do this to him? 
 Page the maxillofacial surgeon. 
 Heather, take him to curtain one. 
 Give him 5 of morphine and let me know when the C.T. comes in. 
 Hey, we're gonna take care of ya! 
 Man : Thanks, I think. 
 You're making patients now? 
 What? He was trying to do the same thing to me. 
 You know, Drew, with all the time and money that you put into your training, it seems like a dumb risk to take. 
 What if you get hurt and you can't work? 
 Then you become my problem. Please don't become my problem. 
 I won't. 
 Good. 
 Now clean up 'cause, man, you stink. 
 No? No good? 
 Get out of here. 
 She's on a rampage. 
 Hey, give the guy a break. 
 Not every doctor's into playing golf like your country club boyfriend. 
 How is it that you look worse than the two men who came in here with their faces bashed in? 
 You... you can't just get rid of the tailgate. 
 We need a place where we can clear our heads during our breaks. 
 You have the food trucks and the break room. 
 The break room's haunted. 
 A man tried to commit suicide from the tailgate. 
 It's a liability issue, not to mention the 70 other O.S.H.A. violations up there. 
 It should've been closed a long time ago. 
 Move on. 
 Hey, Paul. 
 Do me a favor. 
 Grab resusci Annie out of the supply room and move it to the lounge. I've got to run up to the lab. 
 Uh, yeah, no problem. Got it. 
 [Switch clicks] 
 Okay. 
 [Grunts] 
 [Screams] 
 Oh, my God! 
 [Screaming] Oh, my God! Aah! 
 [Laughter] 
 Really?! 
 Not cool! 
 Interns are supposed to stick together, right? 
 It's alive! 
 It's alive! 
 TC! Hunting accident out near Medina. 
 Ambulance can't get to them. Medevac's waiting. 
 I'm on it. Uh, Paul, you're up! 
 Uh, okay. 
 Come on, Paul! 
 This is it! Big time! 
 [Laughter] 
 [Leopold and his Fiction's "Deep Alleyway Blues" playing] 
 ♪ 
 I thought you guys would never make it. 
 Follow me. Henry got attacked by a hog and accidentally fired his crossbow and hit Amy. 
 Now be careful. A lot of these hunters are pretty wasted. 
 Man : [Whoops] 
 Watch out! 
 Yeehaw! 
 [Gunfire, dogs bark and howl] 
 Man : Guys, where you at?! 
 Wh-wh-wh-what... what is this place? 
 It's a hunting ground. Feral hogs are mean sons of bitches. 
 Man : Come on! 
 It's open season. 
 They're right over here. 
 [Engines revving] 
 [Groans and whimpers] 
 Man : [Shouts indistinctly] 
 Amy : Aah! 
 It's okay, ma'am. 
 Paul, focus on your primary trauma survey... A.B.C.D.E. 
 Airway, uh, patent. Good... good air movement. 
 [Speaks indistinctly] 
 She's stable. I gotta help this guy. 
 Paul : It's okay, ma'am. 
 [Gunshots] 
 [Screams] 
 It's okay, buddy, I'm a doctor. 
 [Gunfire] 
 Hey! Hey! Tell your guys to stop firing, or I'll shove those guns up their asses! 
 My hand! Damn hog bit off my hand! 
 [Crying and screaming] 
 Paul! I need a suture kit, a needle driver, and 10 of morphine! 
 Paul! 
 I'm coming. I'm coming. 
 [Screaming] 
 Hold this for me? 
 Yeah, yeah. I got it. 
 Paul! Come on! 
 Are you all right? 
 [Breathing heavily] 
 Uh, what do you need? 
 Suture kit, needle driver, 10 of morphine. 
 10 of morphine in the field? 
 [Groaning] 
 He could be hypotensive. 
 He's not an old lady with a bum ankle. 
 He's in pain. I've given twice that in the battlefield. Come on. 
 [Continues screaming] 
 Aah! 
 I need to stop this arterial pumper before he bleeds out. 
 Go tell the pilot to start up the chopper. 
 We're out of here in five, okay? Keep your head down. 
 [Sighs] 
 Hold still. You're gonna be okay. 
 Hey, wait! We haven't even found his hand yet. 
 If we don't get out of here in five, he won't need a hand. 
 He'll be dead. 
 [Telephone rings in distance] 
 [Siren wailing] 
 Hi. 
 You work here? 
 No. I'm 9 years old. 
 You're right. Silly question. 
 I don't feel good. My head hurts. 
 I feel like I'm gonna throw up. 
 Well, you came to the right place. 
 Where's your mom? 
 She died. 
 Oh. Uh, and... and your dad? 
 He's at the refinery. 
 So how'd you get here? 
 I took the bus. 
 The 93 Express to the transit center, then the 100. 
 That's pretty impressive. 
 Not really. 
 I'm mean, it's all online. 
 [Laughs] Yeah, of course. 
 Um, what's your name? 
 Kylie. 
 Kylie, I'm Topher. 
 Let's... Let's call your dad. 
 [Voice over P.A]: Portable x-ray to the E.R. 
 [Voice over P.A]: Portable x-ray to the E.R. [Whispers] Your sutures are too far apart. Maybe if you weren't staring over my shoulder. Is everything okay here? Yeah, everything's fine. I'll be right back. Can we talk? Sure. You mind laying off in front of the patient? Do I "mind laying off"? That ever work with your drill sergeant? You're my drill sergeant now? No, but I am your boss, and you should've been done stitching that guy 10 minutes ago. A 2-layered closure on a facial lac? That's first-year stuff. Get it done. [Cries] [Whispers] Hey, Krista. Hey. Can you... Yeah, what's up? I messed up my hand. I think I did more damage to air force's face suturing him up than I did during the fight. Okay, Drew, you need to get this x-rayed. I already know what it's gonna say. It's gonna be a hairline metacarpal fracture. I need a splint, but I can't let Jordan know 'cause she'll kill me, so... I need your help. Can you stick with me during the shift tonight and help me on all my cases? Yeah. Help me out with this guy. Okay. [Gunfire continues] [Engine revs] [Helicopter blades whirring] Tell him to get out of our airspace so we can get out of here! [Gunfire] [Heartbeat thumping] [Rapid gunfire] We're under fire from everywhere! I could use some help. So could I, but it ain't coming, bro. It's all on us! Paul : TC! TC, we're good to go. All right. Let's get out of here. So Scott's in town for the weekend? He is. Ragosa's wining and dining him. He wants him to move here and run the trauma department. How you feel about that? That's a big step. I just wanna make sure that it's the right step. You know... [Clipboard closes] I followed TC down here after he was discharged, and... I just wanna take things slowly. Which reminds me... I promised I would ask. Scott's best friend, Todd. Oh, God. Hear me out. Hear me out. Look, he's really nice. He's a vascular surgeon here at the hospital. And, you know, he's seen you around. Wait, you're not seeing anyone, are you? No, I'm not, but... Okay, wait. Just meet him. I promise, it'll be painless. We're all going to brunch after the shift. And you know what? If you don't like him, you can kick me under the table and we'll ditch him. Okay. Good. Ow! Oh. That hurt. Okay. Not gonna shine a light in your eyes anymore. My head hurts all over. You think it's a migraine? My dad has them. Huh. [Knock on door] Topher... Oh, speaking of whom. Daddy! You had the sitter worried sick, babe. You can't just take off. I'm sorry. What's wrong with her? She's complaining of headaches. It's probably nothing. But I do wanna get an M.R.I. All right, well, how long is it gonna take? How... [Clipboard rattles] Can we... Is everything okay? Yeah. What's an M.R.I. gonna run me? I don't think cost should be an issue here. She has a headache, light sensitivity, nausea. These are possible signs of increased intercranial pressure. Look, I know my kid, all right? This... this is just a grab for attention. I don't think it is. She took two buses on her own to get... Save the lecture, buddy. I know I look like the world's worst father right now, okay? Just... run your tests. Just make sure she's okay. 28-year-old female versus arrow. 38-year-old man versus hog, with traumatic hand amputation at the wrist. I'll take him, you take her. Trauma one, trauma two. Her name's Amy. Lung collapsed en route. No breath sounds on the right side. Hey, Amy, I'm Dr. Alexander. I'm gonna help you, okay? Hey, Kenny. Page Todd. He's a vascular surgeon. We might be able to reattach. Wait, where's the hand? Right behind you. Man : [Groaning] Draw a rainbow. Hey, Kenny! Get that hog to radiology. Call for a forearm x-ray for this guy. Push 50 micrograms of fentanyl. My hand. It throbs like a bitch! Make it 100. [Groaning continues] Kenny. Kenny! I need you in here. 36 French. Prep the thora-seal. [Muffled voice] I can't breathe. I know, Amy. We're gonna fix that. I'm gonna insert a tube into your chest to reinflate your lung. I can't breathe. [Muffled screaming] Kenny : It's okay, ma'am. Try to relax. [Coughing] You have to stop moving. Amy, take deep breaths, okay? The coughing is normal while your lungs reinflate. One of ativan. No, I can't breathe. Get it out! [Gasping] She's hemorrhaging. [Monitor beeping erratically] She's dislodged the clot. Okay, I need to open her up. Type and cross 4 units of P.R.B.C.S, give me 2 units on the rapid infuser. That hog attacked your husband, bit off his hand. Now he's stable. Oh, thank God. Henry, baby. But we're trying to find the hand while it's still viable. I understand. Can he hear me? Uh, he's in and out from the pain meds, but, uh, you're welcome to spend a few minutes alone. Woman : TC, Jordan needs you in trauma two. [Monitor beeping erratically] She pulled out the damn arrow. Lost at least 2 liters of blood in the chest. Suction. Forceps. Can you clamp off the pulmonary hilum? I need a dry field. Will do. 2.0 prolene. Kenny : You guys order the AB-Neg neat? Yeah, get it on the rapid infuser. [Monitor beeping steadily] Sutures are in. Yep. All right, let's see how I did. Paul, can you release the clamp? Field's remaining dry. B.P.'s coming up. Nice job. [Indistinct conversations] Hey. How's it goin'? [Sighs] Usual crazy. Henry's stable for now. How about you? Usual crazy. So porkchopping... Sounds like it was intense. Nothing I don't see three times a week. The cases, not that environment. Paul said it was like a war zone out there. It was nothing like war. [Scoffs] I'm just concerned about you, what with all the gunfire, the yelling... Yelling. Huh. Um... [Elevator bell dings] You were doing some yelling yourself this afternoon. I'm not trying to treat you. I'm just checking in. Uh-huh. And you're not nearly as charming as you think you are. [Man speaks indistinctly over P.A.] So this giant tube's gonna take a picture of your head. Now it doesn't hurt, but it is noisy so... What... what is... [Gasps] These should help with that. I'm gonna strap you in, okay? Now I like to pretend I'm in a rocket ship, going out into outer space. Space is a cold vacuum. Yes. I guess it is. Hey, remember, still as a statue, okay? Daddy, are you gonna get your picture taken, too? Not today, kiddo. Topher : Okay. [Beep] I will be right in the little room, and we can talk through the intercom. Topher : It should take about 10 minutes. Why don't you wait outside? [Taps buttons] [Scanner whirring] [Clicks intercom button] So just relax  and breathe easy, Kylie. We'll start up in a minute. Hey, I need the film for the hog. Hey, what's this I hear about Todd and Landry going out on a blind date? Yeah, right. Good one. Rumor Mill's working overtime on it. You mean big Todd? [Chuckles] Rumor has it he has a huge pen1s. Hmm. Hate to follow that guy. I took a peek once in the locker room... Talk about a hog. Like I'm the only one who looks! Dwayne, the x-ray. [Whirring continues] 
 
 Where's my dad? He should be here. He's... he's right outside, Kylie. Just hang in there. You need to help him. I wanna stop. I wanna stop! Turn... turn it off. [Beep, whirring stops] You're okay. You're okay. You're okay. Okay? Okay? [Crying] I lied. I'm sorry I was faking. Don't make me go in there again, please. Jordan : Our arrow patient is crashing! [Monitor beeping erratically] Thank God. What happened? Uh, she's hypotensive and... and tachy. Pulse ox dropped to 89%. I thought she was bleeding again, but there's no output in the thora-seal, so... Pillow. Okay. Okay, she's wheezing. Neck is swollen. Diffuse urticaria. She's in anaphylactic shock? Uh, what's she allergic to? 125 milligrams of I.V. solu-medrol, 0.3 milligrams of epi I.M. What did she get, people? Antibiotics? Analgesics? Uh, no. Nothing. It's the blood. AB-Neg, typed and crossmatched. Stop the transfusion, now. Paul, get her phone and start calling. Call anyone that you can find to give us her medical history. We need to figure out what blood to give her before she codes. His hand is in the hog? Mm-hmm. Pretty impressive. His buddies tracked it down. [Cell phone rings] The vascular surgeon is on his way in to perform the reattachment. [Ring] Is this Henry's stuff? Yeah. [Under breath] What the hell's she want? Now why the hell are you calling my husband, you no good whore? Uh, this is Dr. Cummings from San Antonio Memorial Hospital? Well, this is Ginger Brown. I'm already here with my husband. So why are you calling his phone from my sister's? Mrs... Mrs. Brown? Paul : Uh... Is she here? Is Amy here? Oh, son of a bitch. [Mouths words] Was she hunting with Henry?! Oh, damn you, Henry! Damn you to hell! You promised! Little help in here! Ginger : You promised me! You promised! Can we, uh, talk? Hospital stuff or your stuff? Just walk with me. So my wife is going to "allow" me to see the children over the weekend. She actually used the word "allow." [Groans] She just really pisses me off. Everybody pisses you off. Let's be clear here. When we talk, you're not my boss, you're my patient. I have to speak honestly or this won't help you, okay? Yes. You're right. Please continue. You have to stop taking everything someone says as an attack. I don't take... Honestly, your first step is to stop being a dick. That's your advice? Stop being a... Dick. Yes. Look, I don't see you at home, but I can guess you're a lot like you are here. And here at work, taking away the tailgate was a dick move. That was a legal issue. I had no choice. But you can choose to find a solution. You can't like having everybody always pissed at you. Comes with the job. No, it doesn't. You bring that to the job. And you bring it into your home life. You want people to start respecting you? Then you have to learn to meet them halfway. Man : Kylie, why would you do that? She... she thinks something is wrong with you. She didn't wanna say anything in front of you. So the whole M.R.I. was for nothing? I knew you'd be mad. You almost fell down last night. You didn't think I saw, but I did. You need a doctor. Damn it, Kylie. You don't look great, Steve. She says you've been having headaches... Yeah, I mean, I'm working doubles the whole week, all right? I came down with the flu. That's all it is. Please, daddy. I made him promise. No needles. Look, I have a daughter. I-I know that they can be absolutely annoying, but they mean well. We can do a quick workup. What if it's not the flu? Better safe than sorry? If I miss the rest of the shift, I risk losing my job, okay? Kylie, I'm fine, baby. All right? I'm not mom. I'm really sorry she wasted your time. I gotta get her home and I gotta get back to work. Let's go. Please, daddy, no! Stop! It won't take long! I'll do chores for a week! He wants to help you! Please! There's gotta be something we could do to bring back the tailgate. What if we, uh, put up railings? Made it a-a smaller, more contained area? Yes, yes. I-I'm aware of that. Well, there are a few doctors here who I wouldn't mind jumping off the roof. [Chuckles] No, no, no. That's, uh, that's a joke. I... What a dick. [Exhales deeply] Damn it! Why is this thing still inside? Somebody get it out of here. Now! [Slaps] [Hog groans] Whoa! [Hog squealing] Topher, watch out! He's coming in! Watch out! Whoa! What the hell? Don't shoot! He's heading towards the loading dock. Call animal control. We need some tranqs. [Indistinct conversations] God bless Texas. Help! Topher, help! It's my dad! [Wheezing] Drew, get the head. I'll get the shoulders. You are gonna be okay, daddy. [Wheezing continues] Steve! You hear me? He just fell! Do something, please! You hear that stridor? His vocal cords are spasmed shut. We'll never pass an E.T. tube. Krista, grab the crike kit. Hey! Hey, give us light! You've been dying to do a crike. This is your shot. [Continues wheezing] Let Krista do it. I would've killed for one as an intern. Kylie : Please! You're up. Seriously? All right. Krista, you are up! I'll walk you through it. Just... you gotta extend... The neck and palpate for the laryngeal prominence. I got it. Kylie : I'll take care of you, daddy. Here. Okay, you make a vertical incision. Good. It's gonna be alright. Good. Okay, palpate again. Okay, now you make a horizontal incision along the cricoid membrane. You got this, Krista. Okay. Lift and stabilize the larynx... Insert the tube. Kylie : You have to save him. [Continues wheezing] Let's get him inside! It's gonna be on your count. Krista : All right. One, two, three. Topher : He's gonna be fine. I told you something was wrong with him! And you didn't believe me! No, I... You have to do something. You have to save him. I-I'm... I'm gonna do my best, Kylie. Okay. I promise. [Crying] [Monitor beeping steadily] He's having pauses. Order a chest x-ray, an EKG, and a chem-20. He's got papilledema. Brain bleed from a head trauma? Maybe. Maybe. Uh, add a... add a head C.T. and a tox screen. Where are his labs? Well, the mass spec is down, and the E.R. lab is backed up by at least two hours. Why does everything break at night? [Fabric rips] Whoa, chemical burn! That's probably an acid exposure. Everybody back. Gloves off. Switch to neoprene. Get his clothes off and out of here. What kind of acid do you think... Who knows without the blood work. Check in with poison control. Set me up for a high volume irrigation and grab me some silvadene. The flu my ass. Man : I need morphine. Stat! Give me a thousand cc's of... of anything. Yeah, no, I'll get right on that. Let's just get that abscess drained... I hear you passed up a crike. Have a seat. Are you really that into Krista? Or is it something else? Ah! Unbelievable. You're injured! Do you have any idea how much trouble we could both be in? Can I get that morphine? Look, it's not that... You're on cold and flu duty until further notice. And get that thing splinted after your shift! I think she means business. Why? You know, why does she have to do this? Of all the men in the world, why does she have to cheat  with my husband? I know this is hard for you... Henry is all I have. Now Amy? She can have any guy she wants. Always could. Our whole lives. Yeah, that sucks. Okay, it really does. And I'm sorry, but your sister is very sick. Good. God finally decided to even things up a bit. 'Cause this isn't the first time she and Henry... He promised me. He promised me. Does she have any allergies or pre-existing conditions? She always had something going on. Whatever got her the most attention. Was she ever transfused blood? She had a wreck in high school, had to have surgery. There were all kinds of complications. I mean, you should've seen her, sitting in her bed for months like a princess on a pea. She's alloimunized against minor blood antigens. What does that mean? It means your sister is allergic to our entire blood bank. She needs very specific blood, lacking the same antigens as hers. Like yours. Or she'll die. Oh. So she finally needs something from me? All that girl does is take and take and take and take. Well, all the pain's she's caused me... [Inhales deeply] I'm done givin'. She's on her own. [Monitor beeping steadily] Her sister completely refuses to give blood. There's a lot of anger there. How long can Amy hold out without the blood transfusion? Couple hours tops. We have her on pressors, but it's just delaying the inevitable. Well, can't just force her to give blood. Let me check with the lawyers and see what I could do. Actually, we could just force her. We could just knock her out and take her blood. How 'bout we stick with the legal option first? I liked your idea. Mm. Oh. Isn't that your date? Jordan roped me in. You don't have to apologize. I wasn't apologizing. Hey, TC. Hey! Big Todd. Nurses been talking about me again? Mnh-mnh. Dwayne from radiology. Huge fan. Landry, right? I'm Todd. Believe we have a breakfast date. I'm looking forward to it. So... Here it is. What the hell? You called me in for that? Looks like you need a butcher, not a surgeon. Paul, the hand. Never in my life did I think I'd be assisting on a hog surgery. All you have to do is reattach. If it's still viable. Lot of work to keep that thing alive. You do know they're pests, right? Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. [Chuckles] Don't talk about Bruce that way. Bruce? Yeah, damn right. Bruce is a survivor. He's been shot, presumed dead, shot at again. You ever been shot at, big Todd? No. No, that's right, 'cause you didn't serve. Okay, call me if there's a problem. Enjoy your date. Okay, poison control says that oil workers can work around sulfuric acid. It's not sulfuric. It's not sulfuric. Phosphoric? That doesn't explain the other symptoms. Near syncope, tingling, arrhythmias, and laryngospasms. Hydrofluoric acid? [Monitor beeping steadily] What are you doing? It's a poor man's chem-20. Watch his hand, Krista. Watch his hand. Son of a bitch. Thank you. Push 2 amps of calcium chloride right now. He's hypocalcemic? How do you know? See that movement? Trousseau's sign? Telltale for hypocalcemia. A hydrofluoric acid burn leaches the body's calcium. Now if the solution was diluted... Then it would take a few days for the symptoms to start to show. Kylie was right. She watched him deteriorate. Let's get compresses on the burns and iced water solution of zephiran chloride. Look, I am running out of ways to convince you. You are not thinking this all the way through. She did this to herself. Now I am done listening to you people. I am not changing my mind! You're our last chance. Now Amy will die if you do not give her your blood. I hope she does. I'm not doing it, and that's final. E.P.O. injection is in. It isn't enough to keep her alive without the blood. Bolus 1,000 milligrams of I.V. iron. I got the blood. Why is she sedated? You don't wanna know. Connection's set. Let's go, she needs volume now. We... we can actually transfuse directly from person to person? Yep. Buddy transfusion. Did it all the time in combat. You just sedated her. This is so beyond the rules. I mean, TC... Listen, this is all on me. I couldn't let her die. You shouldn't even be here. You... you got too much to lose. [Monitor beeping steadily] And so does Amy. Open her up. Let's do this. [Breathing rhythmically] Oh, is he gonna make it? No. Pete's dead. I'm doing compressions to pump the blood from his body into Boomer's. I had to do what I had to do, right? Yeah, you saved him, TC. You saved him. Kenny : Pulse is strong. B.P.'s up to 105 systolic. Her color's coming back, too. Let's recheck her C.B.C.'s and see where we are. Way to go, TC. Yeah.

You know, buddy, it's probably better that Jordan found out than Ragosa. Yeah, well, plus now people won't think I wimped out on a crike. [Laughs] I don't think anyone thinks you're a wimp. Here, let's see if we can get the swelling down. Just weird having Jordan as the boss. We're friends and so we're just trying to find out where we draw the line. It's all very weird. Yeah, no, I mean, drawing the line with work friends, it's... [Inhales deeply] It's hard. And, you know... I never properly congratulated you... on your victory. ♪ It's all to come ♪ Hey, don't worry. I'm not gonna tell anyone. It... it's not that. Then what? I... Are you gay or something? Oh, God. You're gay? I'm gonna sue you. I'm gonna sue this hospital. You think I give a crap? Hmm? Your sister was dying. And you might not care now, but I promise you... [Velcro rips] In a day, a week, a month, you would've cared. And trust me, you don't want to spend the rest of your life knowing that you let someone die that you could've saved. Sometimes, you do what you have to do. [Voice breaks] They just hurt me so damn much. I know they did. I'm sorry. [Sighs] If you still wanna see your husband or your sister, they're upstairs in recovery. I don't get it. 'Cause "don't ask, don't tell" is already gone. I-I've been to two gay weddings in the past six months. Okay. Were either of them military? Or in Texas? Just coming out changes things. Here, in my unit, in the cage. I'm not the only one that I'm protecting either. I got a... boyfriend, Rick, over there. And Afghanistan, that's not the place you really wanna... come out. Okay. Fine. I get it now. And don't worry. Your secret is safe with me, okay? I know. That's why I-I told you. All right... Listen up, everybody. I have some great news. The tailgate is back! [Cheering] And even better, we are rebuilding it in a corner of the parking lot so that you're closer to the E.R. and you don't have to walk up the stairs. Thank you! Man : That's awesome. [Man whistling] But, in exchange, you have to give up one of your 50-minute breaks each shift. As well as limit the time you can spend there after work. Man : That's just evil. After all, we are footing the electric bill. The cost of doing business. So... Enjoy! Way to snatch defeat from the jaws of victory. What? I met them halfway. But nothing's free. Now they'll respect me because I didn't cave. You know, you could learn some things from me, too. We have a lot of work to do. Right. I'll be in my office. [Woman over P.A.] ... Trauma 1. [Hog squealing] [Woman speaks indistinctly over P.A.] Have you seen Krista? Oh, dude, you gotta let that one go. Hey, uh, do me a favor? Send, uh, send Krista for resusci Annie. If I don't strike back now, I'm gonna be a walking punch line for the rest of the year. Yes? Yes? Okay. Thank you, thank you. Okay. So where's he off to? Oh. [Chuckles] He wants to get you with the resusci Annie gag. Oh, God. He really was homeschooled, wasn't he? You know what? Get your camera ready... [Whispers] 'Cause there's going to be tears. Mmm. Pretty ballsy move you pulled off there with Ginger. Yeah. I'm not big in letting my patients die. So what's the deal with the dress? You going to prom or something? I've got my niece's confirmation after my brunch with big Todd. Would you like to see what I did on my prom? [Woman speaking indistinctly over P.A.] [Bell dings] Look, I'm sorry I lied. It's just... I know you don't like the fighting. It's not that. I hate that you'd risk your future. You could be great, Drew. But as your boss, and, well, more importantly, as your friend, I'd hate to see fighting ruin that. Yeah, but it's not just about punching someone. It's a group of vets, and, uh, we train together. We talk about things. It's like the brotherhood that I had over there. It's therapy. I didn't know that. So... Okay. No more full-on bouts, but I can't stop training. I need it. And I won't ever lie to you again. Good. Because I know everything that goes on in this place. It's my job to know all. ♪ All the world ♪ Do you think big Todd'll like the dress? [Moans] I don't think it's his size. [Giggles] So you're still going to brunch? Mm, more for Jordan than Todd. Oh. Interesting. You wish. I don't have any girlfriends. No? Me neither. [Chuckles] [Door handle rattling] It's okay. I locked the door. [Camera beeps] It's locked. You sure he's in here? Maybe he's in another room. [Groans] I'm meeting Drew. I gotta go. I'm sure he'll figure out I'm not coming eventually. Or he'll be there when our next shift starts. Have... have a good one! You, too! [Objects clattering] ♪ 'Cause I know ♪ 
♪ why I don't worry ♪
