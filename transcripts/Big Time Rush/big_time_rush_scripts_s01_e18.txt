 It's time for the first annual... 
 Big Time Rush brain freeze. 
 *** what's the prize? 
 Brain freeze. 
 Is its own reward. 
 Ready... 
 Set... 
 Go! 
 [Grunting] 
 Every time you hear crying in the squeak of luggage, another Hollywood dream has been crushed. 
 [Crying] 
 I know it's sad but *** Hollywood dream is still alive. 
 No. 
 I'm leaving the Palmwoods. 
 [Crying] 
 [Screaming] 
 Wow. 
 It can get really hard. 
 No, it's just a brain freeze.

 please tell me *** your parts. 
 No, I haven't booked a part in six months. 
 And my dad is making us move back to Connecticut. 
 Don't worry don't go anywhere. 
 You're not going to get me a part? 
 Nope I'm going to hypnotize your dad *** you stay. 
 I've been practising. 
 You're getting very sleepy. 
 Happy, happy... You're getting very happy. 
 Hey guys. Gustavo wants you to come to the studio immediately to discuss your first... 
 Music video. 
 [Crying] 
 Okay. Say good-bye to the crying girl, and let's go. 
 Wait. We can get Camilla a part in a music video. 
 Really? 
 *** your dad until we get back. 
 Got it. 
 Ow! 
 Are you okay? 
 Man. 
 She's good. 
 Boys, Griffin just gave me a big old check to produce your first music video. 
 The city is ours. 
 Quiet. 
 Camille. 
 And we don't know who's in the video because we don't know what the video is. 
 Which is why we are meeting with the hottest video directors to find the concept of BTR. 
 The city is ours. 
 We'll start on the four boys in a car. 
 A pretty, pretty car. 
 Driving. 
 And? 
 That's as far as it goes. 
 What if there was a pretty, pretty girl in the car. 
 Yeah, like Camille from the Palmwoods... please. 
 Look, if Camille doesn't get an acting job, she has to go back to Connecticut. 
 This is a music video, not a charity case. 
 Boys, as you start to get famous people will start to ask you for favors, like a fashion photographer that wants to direct a rock video even though he has no experience. 
 So Michael got the job. 
 No. 
 Did you see what I did there? 
 Even when Marco starts crying, I still say... no. 
 Why? 
 Now, go tell your friend that she's not in the video. 
 She will be in the video. 
 She will be in the video. 
 [Screaming] 
 Step away from the car. 
 I'm right here. 
 Which means you're already too close to my new car. 
 You're right. 
 I'm hoping that the ladies think so, too. 
 Palmwood's park is closed until further notice. 
 Where are we supposed to play kick ball? 
 How about I don't care park. 
 Beat it. 
 So what do we tell Camille? 
 We got to tell her the truth. She can't be in the video. 
 Guys... I can't take that much longer. 
 Can I tell my dad I got the part in your video? 
 Yep. 
 Yes. 
 I love you guys. 
 Whoo! 
 Dad. 
 Not our best move. 
 [Crying] 
 Not you guys, too. 
 We haven't booked a part in a really, really long time. 
 I can be in a music video. 
 Told you that would work. 
 You are not mad at me. 
 You are not mad at me. 
 Yes, we are. 
 No, no, no, no. 
 Kendall I need your help. 
 You can be in our video. 
 Really? 
 Yep. 
 I was just going to see if you could fix this squeaky wheel, but... 
 Thanks. 
 Okay. So I panicked. 
 We'll just put everybody in the background as extras or something. 
 Yeah that is action, right? 
 All: Yes. 
 Besides whoever heard of a music video without girls in it? 
 Oh boys, nobody else. 
 Because this city is them. 
 They are the city. 
 Two girls. 
 We love this idea. 
 You sir, are a genius. 
 We're the city. 
 I'm a skyscraper. 
 Logan is a taxi. 
 Yeah, beep beep. 
 That's not the vision I have. 
 Yes, it is. 
 Gustavo, imagine it. 
 Big Time Rush is a giant singing city. 
 ♪ because the night is young. ♪ 
♪ the line is out the door. ♪ 
♪ today was crazy but, ♪ 
♪ tonight the city's ours. ♪ 
 that is the worst video I've ever imagined... in my life. 
 But that's not my video. 
 And it never will be. 
 Next. 
 Who's the next director? 
 *** 
 if the music video doesn't have girls in it, we kill it. 
 Got it. 
 Guys, Big Time Rush on our own. 
 Nobody else. 
 On the tallest building in Los Angeles. 
 I'm afraid of heights. 
 I hate L.A. buildings. 
 Nosebleed. 
 I get nauseous when I stand up. 
 Next? 
 You're in a magical underwater city... without girls. 
 Can't swim. 
 Me neither. 
 I'm afraid of sharks. 
 I get nauseous just drinking water. 
 Next. 
 Big Time Rush, *** surviving members of the human race and they must re-claim the city. 
 Interesting. 
 Yes. Oh, I can see it now. 
 A post apocalyptic, journey, ugly nightmare. 
 ♪ because the night is young. ♪ 
♪ the line is out the door. ♪ 
♪ today was crazy but, ♪ 
♪ tonight the city's ours. ♪ 
 next. 
 Why can't I find a director I can work with? 
 Okay, what if... 
 The pretty pretty car is going into a stunner. 
 All: And? 
 That's all I got. 
 Once, come on. 
 Are you incapable of shame? 
 Get lost. You're jamming my mojo. 
 This is a park. Not a parking lot. 
 Move this heap so I can move my kite. 
 If you want to fly your kite so bad fly it in the child designated area. 
 This is not over. 
 You bet it isn't. 
 Ah, *** yep. 
 That's why we need to find a crazy creative Hollywood director that would put Camille and Jennifer and Joe in our video. 
 Oh, yeah. That's going to walk right through the front door. 
 Hey, guys. I heard you got a nasty clog. 
 That could work, too. 
 It says here that you directed music video for lady gaga, the red-hot chili peppers, and the fresh beat band. 
 Yeah I don't remember. 
 What do you got? 
 Oh, the city is ours... for one night. 
 Make your city yours. 
 Interesting. 
 Go on. 
 But there's a bunch of kids in it. 
 Tall kids. 
 Weird, tall kids. 
 Girls. 
 Teenage girls. 
 *** teenage girls. 
 No *** teenage boys and girls rocking out to PTR. 
 I love it! 
 You are the director we've been looking for. 
 
 
 
 Yo, Gustavo, there's a clog in toilet. 
 I'll get that. 
 I'm a janitor. 
 All: No you're not. 
 No, I'm not... I'm a director. 
 That's why *** 
 you are fired! 
 And dogs go back to the Palmwoods, and tell your friends that they're fired, too. 
 All: Got it. 
 Don't cry. Don't cry. 
 You're in the video. 
 Don't go anywhere. You're in the video. 
 Guess what? You're in. 
 You're in our video. You, too. 
 Okay. You can be in it, too. 
 Guess what, you're in it. Alright. 
 We're really bad at this. 
 All: Yep. 
 So I did and we've lied to 14 people. 
 17. I told three people at the ice machine *** video. 
 We are not liars. 
 We are not liars. 
 It's not lying if we put all of them in a video. 
 That's all the parents needed to see. 
 To see their kid acting in Hollywood. 
 So we shoot our own video. 
 *** 
 who's the director? 
 The record company wants Big Time Rush's video to be directed by... 
 Big Time Rush. 
 It's high concept. 
 So what's the concept? 
 There's a car. 
 A pretty, pretty car. 
 And we are driving because the city is ours. 
 Cool. 
 What else? 
 It's a video about a flash party on the rooftop over looking the city... 
 Because no matter what city you're in, if you have friends and music you can make the city yours. 
 Awesome. 
 Sounds like really cool. 
 It really is. 
 And once my dad sees the video... 
 Boom! I can stay at the Hollywood. 
 Let's do the video. 
 [Cheering] 
 Did you want me to line up some more directors or not? 
 So the pretty pretty car goes... 
 No. 
 Marco can do this. 
 All directors are idiots. 
 That's what I'm going to direct the music video myself. 
 Because you're an idiot. 
 No, because my video is going to be awesome. 
 It starts with a band. 
 That's all I've got. 
 So we'll shoot the boy in front of a greenroom, and we'll add special effects later. 
 I'm a genius. 
 Okay, *** the studio and get the dogs to bring themselves and not their friends because this video is going to be amazing.

 all: That is the worst music video ever. 
 All: We know. 
 What's really going on? 
 The truth is Gustavo said we couldn't have you guys in our video. 
 We're so sorry. 
 So you put on this entire charade to trick all of us and our parents into thinking we had acting jobs. 
 Yep. 
 That is so sweet. 
 *** slap me right there? 
 Seemed like the thing to do. 
 Guess I better go finish packing. 
 Gustavo was right. 
 You can't make everyone's Hollywood dreams come true. 
 Marcus, you're leaving Hollywood, too? 
 No, I'm moving in. I was dancing while making a ham and it started a fire. 
 By the way your video was horrible. 
 Oh, and you could do better. 
 My chihuahua could do better. 
 However, flash party was inspired. 
 What you need is a pretty, pretty roof. 
 And it's your dream to direct the music video, right? 
 And everybody is... no, no, no. 
 Marcos just needs one... 
 Yes. 
 All: Yes. 
 Okay. Now Marcus needs a camera, lights. 
 You in pretty clothes. 
 All of the crew and the equipment and a pretty, pretty car. 
 Hey, guys. 
 We're shooting the video at 
9:00 A.M. at colossal studios. 
 Bring your smiles, wear these... And you can't direct. 
 Gustavo is. 
 9:00 A.M. 
 Okay, I know where we can get our lights, camera, and crew. 
 And... we have the clothes. 
 But we still need a pretty pretty car. 
 Do you need a cool car? 
 I can get you a cool car. 
 Unbelievable. 
 I must shoot this beautiful creature for my magazine. 
 Yeah, sure. 
 Don't be shy. 
 You're Marcos *** the famous photographer whose photos are in the magazine that a lot of ladies read. 
 That's right. 
 Beautiful. 
 More *** 
 nice. Beautiful. 
 *** 
 wings in your hair. 
 You're on the course. 
 Now, open the trunk. 
 Nice. 
 Show me the junk in your trunk. 
 Oh that's it. 
 More junk in the trunk. 
 Go. 
 Freedom. 
 All right. 
 Are you ready to make the best music video of all-time? 
 Ever? 
 Oh, Gustavo, Kelly said she wanted to see you outside. 
 Fine. But don't move. 
 Hey, the boy said you needed to see me. 
 No. 
 I hate those dogs. 
 Camera... check! Lights... check! 
 Awesome giant car. 
 All: Check! 
 And the pretty, pretty car. 
 All: Check. 
 Wait. You only have a learner's permit. 
 Don't you need an adult in the car? 
 Let me out of here. 
 We're good.

 [clapping and cheering]. 
 Looks like we're staying at the Palmwoods for a while. 
 Oh, yes! 
 We came here to chew you guys out. 
 But... what a great video. 
 And? 
 Great director. 
 And? Marcus loves you. 
 Let's hear it for the guys. 
 [Clapping and cheering] 
 How do you plan on paying for scratch removal, leather treatment and trunk pain and suffering? 
 Well, with the money we saved with the guys shooting the video... how is this? 
 That could work. 
 Add another zero, and sell me the car, and we'll make it Big Time Rush mobile. 
 Done. 
 How did this happen? 
 Gustavo bought us a car. 
 I told you this baby would work. 
 Hey, in two more months I'll have my full license. 
 [Phone ringing] 
 Guys, how much longer do I have to be in here? 
 All: Two more months.
