 Carlos, it wasn't a ghost. 
 Then what was it? 
 It was the air conditioner, which kicked on in the lobby, created a back draft, and caused the doors to shut. 
 So how do you explain the ghost table? 
 I will tell you that later. 
 I'll tell you what it was. 
 It was a ghost, and it could be after us. 
 There is no ghost that is after us. 
 Guys, chill. 
 There is nothing terrifying behind this door. 
 Hey, my mansion is flooded, and I need to stay with you dawgs tonight. 
 Don't you think you'd be more comfortable in, like, a five-star hotel that's not here? 
 Yeah, I can't stayat any L.A. hotels. 
 Why not? 
 Well, James, I am a memberof the hotel unwelcome list along with Russell Crowe, all the members of aerosmith, and the original host of blue's clues. 
 The '90s were a wild time, boys. 
 Well, of course you are welcome to stay mom! 
 Did you see that thing in the bathroom? 
 Yeah, the bathroom! 
 Oh, yeah! 
 Mom. 
 You're a really nice person, and that's one of the things I love about you. 
 But don't let Gustavo stay here. 
 We get so much Gustavo during the week that the palmwoods is where we like to take a break from him! 
 Yeah, plus he's a man-beast. 
 One night is not going to kill you, and doing nice things for people who aren't so nice is nice. 
 Plus, he pays your rent! 
 0now, when's dinner. 
 All right! - Yeah! 
 Fish sticks? 
 Really? 
 It's fish stick Friday. 
 With tots! 
 I actually prefer my fish poached with lemon and my potatoes au gratin. 
 I guess sometimes we play dome hockey. 
 And then a little swirly slide action. 
 Then we play biohazard blast 4: Rise of crotchy. 
 Oh, well, you can count me out of those festivities. 
 I'm stuck! 
 We got you. 
 I battle blasted all three of you. 
 Taste the shame! 
 Yep, you sure showed us. 
 Hey, where's Logan? 
 I haven't seen him for a half hour. 
 That's not-- - gross! 
 My bad. 
 Okay, guys, time for bed. 
 Yes! 
 And, Gustavo, here is a pillow and blanket for you. 
 Pillow fight! 
 No! No pillow fight! 
 Off the bed you know, if my mansion hadn't flooded, I would've been sitting alone all night writing songs. 
 So thanks. 
 It was fun. 
 You see? One night with Gustavo didn't kill you. 
 I thought he was loud when he was awake. 
 How am I suppose to get my beauty sleep? 
 He yells in his sleep? 
 Mom, can you believe this? 
 Oh, these? 
 Sorry, I gave my other pair to Katie. 
 Do it the way I say! 
 Do it! 
 We have got to do something. 
 Not that. 
 Seriously? Sleeping in the lobby. 
 You got a better idea? 
 What about the palmwoods ghost? 
 There's no such thing as ghosts. 
 Get the ghost! 
 Mr. bitters? 
 You're the ghost? 
 Keep your voice down. 
 If people hear ghost, then people move out, and if people move out, there'll be no more palmwoods. 
 But there isn't a ghost. 
 This is just a power outage. 
 There's nothing to be scared of. 
 Who did that? 
 Guys, people are trying to sleep. 
 What a beautiful morning. 
 And here's your suitcase. 
 Turn-by-turn directions back to your mansion. 
 And a box of fish sticks for the road. 
 Hey, what's the rush what do you dawgs do on sunny Saturdays? 
 Well, I'm going ghost hunting to prove to lo-ho-gan that the palmwoods ghost is real. 
 And I'm going with him to prove that there are no ghosts. 
 And I'd ask you to join us, but I don't want to. 
 And we're going to the pool. 
 Again, it was swell hanging out with you last night, .. 
 Bye! 
 You guys should've taken the stairs. 
 Much faster. 
 I saved you seats. 
 We can do this. 
 We are nice people. 
 Ha ha ha! 
 And it won't kill us. 
 Cannon ball! 
 No, no! 
 Where'd everybody go? 
 Now, we run the lobby cam 24/7 
for evidence of ghostly activity. 
 Day one, three minutes into the investigation. 
 Paranormal prognosis? 
 Carlos is stupid. 
 What the heck is going on here? 
 Palmwoods is not haunted. 
 My daughter and I did not come here to be woken up by strange noises and slamming doors. 
 We're having an electrical problem with the plumbing, and it will be fixed today. 
 It's a ghost. 
 No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. 
 There is no ghost. 
 But I will be offering a free in-room movie for any inconvenience. 
 New girl. 
 Nice. 
 What is taking so long? We have to catch that ghost. 
 Ghost hunting takes patience and poise. 
 So don't pressure me! 
 It's 2:03 and there are no such thing as ghosts, and Carlos is still stupid. 
 Okay. Now we just press record and look for anything unusual. 
 Oh, I can see why you guys love that pool, but I'm surprised you don't have more friends. 
 Yeah, they all washed away. 
 So, what's for dinner? 
 I say fish stick Saturday. 
 Fish stick Saturday! 
 Don't...You think... Your mansion is unflooded by now? 
 Yeah, you don't want to sleep on that ugly couch again. 
 You need to be in your own comfy bed. 
 Yeah, don't you miss the comforts of your home and not ours? 
 You know what. You dawgs are right. 
 I miss my things. 
 Thanks again, fellas. 
 You asked if he missed his bed? 
 This is not what we meant. 
 Pillow fight! 
 Oh, and remember when I bumped into Kendall and I spilled my oatmeal? 
 Yeah, 'cause it happened, like, two minutes ago. 
 Good times, man.Good times. 
 This is better than pay-per-view. 
 So tell me, is your mansion unflooded now? 
 Funny you should ask. 
 I just got a call from the crew, and they said it gonna take another day. Or five. 
 What? 
 James! 
 Did you see that cool thing out in the hallway? Come on. 
 He snores all night, scares sunblock girl away, and, oatmeal face? 
 Which is actually good for my complexion. 
 But I can't take five more days! 
 
 
 
 Snap out of it. 
 It's time we take the bull by the horns and handle this like men. 
 What is Gustavo still doing here? 
 He's supposed to be in his mansion alone, writing a new song. 
 Yeah, he flooded his mansion. 
 I know that. And now it's unflooded. 
 I told him last night that he could go back. 
 Wait. He just told us it wasn't ready. 
 Please tell me he's not running around, having fun, and playing. 
 Tag and seek! Kelly's it! 
 What is tag and seek? 
 You guys need to understand that Gustavo didn't play games with kids growing up. 
 His mom made him practice piano all day. 
 Really? 
 See, now I feel kind of bad. 
 Well, don't right. 
 He needs to get back to the mansion and write songs for the album, or there will be no album. 
 Got it. What do we do? 
 Here's the plan. Number one, I'm gonna go back to the studio. 
 Two, you guys get Gustavo back to the mansion and make sure he writes a song and solve everything. 
 Right. 
 Wait, what? 
 Marco polo! 
 No hit backs! 
 What game is he playing? 
 Hey, we need help getting Gustavo back to his mansion. 
 Yeah, well, we need help getting rid of a ghost. 
 There is no ghost. There is no ghost. 
 Yes, there is. 
 And this place is freaking me out. 
 New girl. Nice. 
 We have to get rid of that ghost. 
 Don't worry. 
 We'll catch it ... Tonight. 
 With a fishing net? 
 An ecto-net fishing net. 
 An ecto-net fishing net. 
 Ecto-net! 
 It's a fishing net. 
 Oh, let's go fishing with the fishing net. 
 Gustavo. 
 Hey, we know you need some new songs for the album. 
 So how about this one? 
 Please don't stay another moment we don't want to hear more words spoken walk on through the door oh, look. It's open! 
 And you snore in the dark and it's freaking us out bad, right? 
 Terrible. 
 You know what, you should probably go back to the mansion and write a new song. 
 A better song for the album. 
 No, let's go with yours. 
 I'm skiing down the alps. 
 Okay, it's day two.10:53 P.M. 
 Me, bitters, and Logan are gonna sleep in the lobby in hopes to catch the ghost. 
 There are no ghosts. 
 Dude. - Did you hear that? 
 It was the ghost. 
 Bitters just ripped one. 
 We roll Gustavo onto the stretcher. 
 Roll him back to his mansion and in front of his piano. 
 Then he writes a song, and we get our crib back. 
 Got his legs? Got his legs? 
 Too far. Lose him. Lose him. Going down! Going down! 
 What was that? 
 Mommy! 
 Mommy! 
 Oh, it's just us! 
 And Gustavo, who's still here! 
 And you snore in the dark and it's freaking's us out come on! 
 Whoa! - Go, go, go, go. 
 Boys? 
 I cannot believe we can't get rid of Gustavo. 
 Yeah, well, I can't believe we can't get rid of a ghost. 
 You believe in ghosts? 
 I believe in the doo-doos in my pants. 
 Ghost! 
 We haven't failed this bad since we lost to duluth east in hockey 8-1. 
 Right. 
 That was the game that Kendall and I got ejected from for unsportsman like mooning. 
 Wait a minute. That's it. 
 We should moon Gustavo and the ghost? 
 No. 
 We beat duluth east later in the finals because we were all back on the ice together. 
 As a team. 
 Right! 
 We're gonna team moon them. 
 Almost. 
 We're gonna team up. 
 Vacuum cleaners. We're gonna trap a ghost with vacuum cleaners. 
 No. 
 Ecto-vacuum cleaners. 
 They trap dust mites, stale odors, and ghosts. 
 So how come I don't get a vacuum? 
 Oh, you're the ghost bait. 
 Oh, right. 
 W-w-w-w-what? W-w-what? 
 So are we gonna be taking turns as ghost bait? Guys? Guys? 
 Okay, I'm alone and scared. 
 I would really like some... the ghost! 
 Ghost! 
 Stop right there! 
 Wow, you're a really freaky ghost. 
 Ecto-vacuums. Go! 
 Get it!

 The new girl? 
 You were the ghost? 
 And I would've gotten away with it too if it weren't for you meddling, cute, hot guys. 
 Why would you do that? 
 I'm making a no-budget horror movie, and I kind of used you guys as my cast. 
 Say hi to the cameras. 
 Are you guys mad? 
 Nah. 
 Yes! Please don't tell. 
 It's way past my curfew, and I broke a lot of bitter's stuff in the lobby. 
 Sure, we won't tell. 
 On one condition. 
 Gustavo. 
 Return to your mansion now! 
 Go to your piano and--and write some songs, uh... d-dance songs. 
 Some dance songs. 
 Return to your mansion now and write some songs! 
 Ghost! 
 And cut. 
 That's a wrap. 
 Yes! 
 What is going on? It's 3:30 in the morning. 
 Katie, let me handle this. 
 What is going on? It's 3:30 in the morning! 
 Mom, this is Stephanie King. 
 She's the palmwoods ghost. 
 She helped us scare Gustavo back to his mansion! 
 So, what happens now? 
 Gustavo writes a song, and you guys do a music video?

 Gustavo is gone. 
 And so is the ghost. 
 Then we can all relax again by the palmwoods pool. 
 Stephanie. 
 It's not me. 
 Man, I can't believe how much fun you can have with fishing line. 
 I told you so.
