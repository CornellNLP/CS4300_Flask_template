 So we were enjoying a calm afternoon in the crib. 
 Whoo! 
 [all grunting] 
 Whoo! 
 [all yelling] 
 [air horn blaring] 
 Get your helmets off and your smiles on. 
 Gustavo pulled some strings, and if we hurry,  you can make the next pop tiger hot-new-star pinup fold-out special spring poster issue. 
 Kelly, in English, please? 
 It's picture day! Move it! 
 [air horn blaring] 
 [all cheering] 
 I can't believe we're gonna be in pop tiger. 
 I know, it's totally awesome! 
 What's a pop tiger? 
 Only the most popular teen magazine in the world. 
 Is that Katie's? Please tell me it's Katie's. 
 Hey, this magazine has great articles for guys too, like, "OMG, I IM'd the wrong BFF." 
 "what one thing would hottie hunk Dak Zevon bring to a desert island?" 
 I got to say, I'm curious. 
 His dog snowball! 
 What? 
 What an idiot. 
 Everyone knows you bring a roller coaster! 
 You don't bring a roller coaster. 
 You bring a flare gun to signal passing ships. 
 Oh, what, you don't think people are gonna see my extreme looping coconut coaster? 
 Your island is stupid. 
 Your island is boring! 
 You're boring. 
 No, you're boring! 
 You're boring. 
 You're boring. 
 [both yelling at once] 
 [air horn blaring] 
 Break it up. You need to stay pretty. 
 This picture could end up on the walls of millions of girls. 
 All: Did you say "millions of girls"? 
 [all screaming] 
 False alarm. It's not him! 
 [all moaning] 
 Somebody just spotted him at the front gate! 
 [all screaming] 
 Whoa, what was that? 
 That was a pack of screaming fan girls looking for Dak Zevon. 
 He's in the studio recording vocals for varsity vampire 2: Game on. 
 [funky electronic music] 
 ♪ take it to the hoop every chance we get, ♪ 
♪ 'cause when the sun goes down, ♪ 
♪ we're creatures of the net. ♪ 
 [air hissing] 
 Just one great picture in pop tiger 
 and those girls will be screaming for big time rush. 
 [all yelling at once] 
 Mom and Katie. 
 Hey, what are you guys doing here? 
 What, I can't just come down to see my Big Brother, who I love? 
 Oh. 
 Here to see Dak Zevon? 
 I just want him to autograph this picture for my wall. 
 Really? 
 I didn't think you were into that stuff. 
 I'm a preteen girl. He's a cute pop star. 
 I'm not made of stone, you know. 
 Oh, yeah. Let me take a look at that. 
 [in a high-pitched voice] 
look, I'm Dak Zevon. 
 And I love you, Katie knight. 
 [all screaming] 
 That's not him. 
 [all screaming] 
 Now, where's Dak recording? 
 Sorry. I'm not allowed to say. 
 Oh, look into those eyes and say that. 
 Studio "b," down the hall to the right. Just stop with the eyes. 
 Girls... many girls in the... ouchies. 
 [thumping dance music] 
 [all yelling at once] 
 [camera shutter clicking] 
 This is so not like school picture day. 
 Oh! [laughs] 
 Are you ready to rock my camera? 
 All: What? 
 I said, are you guys ready to rock my... 
 Hold on a minute! 
 [music stops] 
 That's better! So how are you guys doing? 
 [all speaking at once] 
 Boys, this is Marcos del Posey, the best teen idol photographer on the planet. 
 Some say photographer. 
 Some say magician. 
 Mira. One camera. 
 [camera shutter clicking] 
 [grunting] 
 Now, oh, two camera! 
 [grunting] 
 Okay, here's what I'm thinking: shirts open, hair blowing, with... the stuffy puppy. 
 [all scream] 
 No. 
 What? 
 Marcos invented the stuffy puppy shot. 
 Yeah, no! 
 What I want is a simple shot of the four best friends just chilling and being themselves. 
 I totally agree. 
 I totally don't care. 
 Now get on the backdrop and look handsome. 
 Come on, take it over. 
 I changed my mind about the island. 
 I'm gonna bring a fridge packed with ice cream. 
 Where are you gonna get the electricity, genius? 
 Electric eels, duh. 
 [both yelling at once] 
 [air horn blaring] 
 Dogs, heel! 
 We need a great picture 
 before the pop tiger messenger gets here in two hours. 
 Now look into the camera and think about something funny. 
 You mean like that? 
 [all laughing] 
 Take the picture. 
 Take the picture now, before something goes wrong! 
 What could go wrong? 
 I am Marcos. 
 Oh, you don't know these boys, so snap the picture now. 
 Freeze! 
 Oh, so close. 
 Gustavo Rocque, you failed to report to your court-ordered community service. 
 Officers, I don't know what you're talking about. 
 I'm talking about destroying Matthew McConaughey's mailbox with... her. 
 He made me be the lookout. 
 Hey, I'm the victim here. 
 He plays the bongos till 3:00 in the morning! 
 Let's go. 
 Ow! 
 Drama. 
 [grunts] 
 [pulsing dance music] 
 Let me go. Come on. 
 Get your hands off me. 
 Gustavo. 
 I see the photo shoot's going well. 
 Griffin, perfect! 
 Look, we're in a bit of a jam here. 
 Tell them to take their hands off me so I can take that picture. 
 Don't worry. I'll take care of everything. 
 Ha, you heard the fourth most powerful CEO in America. 
 ♪♪♪ 
 Oh, I didn't mean unhand you. 
 I meant I'd take care of the photo shoot. 
 I'm very creative. 
 [both speaking at once] 
 Great news, everyone. I'm in charge. 
 Now, let's get my big-time boys on the walls ff teen girls everywhere. 
 [all cheering] 
 All I have to do is push this button and... 
 Wait. 
 This isn't bad, but... 
 Change everything. 
 We need something bolder, something nobody's ever seen before. 
 [screams] 
 Space matadors. 
 I love it. 
 He's right. 
 All: No one's ever seen this before. 
 [girls screaming] 
 Mr. Zevon is not accepting visitors. 
 Get out! 
 [all moaning] 
 And stay out. 
 You guys handled that very well. 
 Now, if you'll excuse us, we're here to see Mr. Zevon. 
 Forget it, lady. Move along. 
 Yeah, move along, lady. 
 If you'll excuse me, boys, I just need to get through here. 
 Forget it. 
 Look, she just wants an autograph. 
 And look into these eyes and try to say "no." 
 Both: No. 
 Man, you guys are good. 
 The best. 
 Both: Now, beat it! 
 We're getting that autograph, right? 
 Oh, yeah. 
 Ugh, I can't believe I helped you vandalize private property. 
 I can't believe somebody threw away these perfectly good joke teeth. 
 Um, those aren't joke teeth. 
 Gimme those! 
 We have to get out of here now. 
 Griffin may be a genius when it comes to corporate takeovers, but he's got the creative pop sensibility of a walnut. 
 You set up a nice, perfect, simple shot. 
 How bad could he mess it up? 
 This is really messed up. 
 Okay. 
 Our first picture, and it's going to brand us forever as space matadors! 
 This is not going to impress millions of girls. 
 I would say six or seven Max. 
 Smile pretty, pretty. 
 Wait. 
 [all sigh] 
 The teen girl inside me says something's missing. 
 All: Yeah. 
 Marcos knows what it is. 
 All: Kendall. 
 Don't panic. 
 In three seconds, Gustavo will barge through that door and fix everything, like he always does. 
 One... 
 Two... 
 Giant stuffy puppies for everyone. 
 That's not Gustavo. 
 [laughs] 
 One, two, three. Beautiful. 
 Okay. 
 Perfect. 
 The photo is now bold and cute and cuddly. 
 Let's shoot it. 
 Smile pretty, pretty. 
 ♪ ah, ah, ah-ah, oh ♪ 
 Okay. 
 Now we panic. 
 Okay, I get it. 
 You guys didn't want to look like space matadors, but then what happened? 
 Top teen photographer Marcos was about to take the picture when... 
 Wait! 
 We can't take this photo. 
 Why not? 
 Because it's not finished. 
 I mean, sure, it's bold and... 
 And cute and cuddly, but we don't have... 
 A snowmobile. 
 What? 
 A what? 
 Sure. 
 With a snowmobile, you're bold, cuddly, and dangerous. 
 It's the pop pinup hat trick. 
 The space matadors are right. 
 Get me a snowmobile. 
 Everybody take five for a snowmobile break. 
 
 
 
 [all cheer] 
 We cannot let Griffin take this photo. 
 By the way, kudos on the snowmobile idea. 
 Which is why I'm taking one with me on my desert island. 
 A desert island has a tropical climate, professor. 
 Will you just let me have fun on my desert island? 
 It's mine. 
 Well, I'm taking my lucky comb. 
 But you're alone. 
 No one's gonna see your hair. 
 Hey, I'm there. 
 Focus. 
 All: Right. 
 We need to figure out a way to change this photo. 
 Yes, from cuddly space matadors to... 
 Something like this. 
 There he is! 
 [all screaming] 
 It's not him. 
 [all screaming] 
 Let's put this photo away before somebody gets killed, shall we? 
 Right. Now, where's Gustavo, 'cause he should be saving our photo! 
 Gustavo's not coming back, which means we have to do this on our own. 
 Ouchies. 
 Is my head on backwards? 
 No. 
 And we're in charge now. 
 What do we do? 
 We're gonna take a secret photo 
 and give that to the pop tiger messenger when he gets here. 
 James, you're in charge of wardrobe. 
 We need cooler clothes. No offense to matadors. 
 Logan, we need to get this room super bright like Marcos' lights. 
 And Carlos, you're gonna break down any door, that stands in our way. 
 Great, but we still need a camera and a white backdrop. 
 No, we just need a camera. 
 [Beep!] 
 And when are we going to do all this? 
 We've got plenty of time. 
 You know how long it's going to take Griffin to find a snowmobile in L.A.? 
 [engine revving] 
 [all scream] 
 Look what daddy found. 
 Now let's go take that picture. 
 [engine revving] 
 We need to get back to the studio. 
 There is no way the dogs can handle Griffin without me. 
 Yeah, but how are we gonna get out of here? 
 Here's the plan. 
 Kelly, you start by tying together all the garbage bags to fashion a crude zip line. 
 Gums, you and I will make decoy dummies of discarded newspapers and empty soda cans. 
 And corrections officer, you stand guard while the corrections officer does... 
 [moans] 
 New plan, run. 
 This way to freedom, gums! 
 Go on! I'll hold 'em off! 
 We'll never forget you, gums! 
 [adopts French accent] 
Lunch delivery for Mr. Zevon. 
 Is that the sweet salmon with potatoes and tarragon? 
 Uh, yes. 
 That's not what he ordered. 
 [laughs] 
 Hey, fellas. Good to see you again. 
 I told you this wasn't gonna work. 
 You know, I think we're all gonna laugh about this someday. 
 [knuckles cracking] 
 [screaming] 
 [Crash!] 
 Ugh, you will get that Dak Zevon autograph today! 
 Ooh, I love it when you get that mad, crazy look in your eye. 
 [growls] 
 My inner teen girl is so putting this picture on her wall. 
 My inner teen girl says we need... 
 One more stuffy puppy. 
 Your inner teen girl is wrong. 
 Now shoot it. 
 Wait! 
 [groans] 
 We need more fog. 
 He's right. We need more fog. 
 We're on it. 
 More fog coming. 
 Come on, you guys. Fog it up. 
 [all yelling at once] 
 That might have been too much fog. 
 [all coughing] 
 All right, everyone. Fog break. Five minutes. 
 See you later. 
 Yeah, I agree. 
 We'll see you later. 
 Secret photo time. 
 Nice! 
 Let's go! Let's go! 
 Stand back, mi amigos. 
 [screams] 
 [Crash!] 
 That was fun. 
 Enter my domain, boys. 
 Looking good. It's what I do. 
 What about the pants? 
 We'll shoot it from the waist up. 
 Move out! 
 Pop tiger and the walls of girls everywhere,  Here we come. 
 [camera beeping] 
 [beeping slowing] 
 Battery dead? 
 Yep. 
 [knocking at door] 
 Hey, fellas. 
 The fog is gone. 
 Let's take that picture. 
 [all talking at once] 
 [phone beeping] 
 Do you really think a screaming teen flash mob is a good idea? 
 Those security guards were mean to my little girl, and you will get that autograph. 
 [girls screaming] 
 Ladies! 
 Are you tired of being told you can't meet your cute teen idol? 
 All: Yeah! 
 Are you ready to show those security guards the collective power of screaming teenage girls? 
 All: Yeah! 
 Are you ready for a Dak attack? 
 [all screaming] 
 Or we could go home and let Dak live, 'cause, mom, I think you've kind of lost it. 
 Let's get him! 
 [all screaming] 
 Yep, she's definitely lost it. 
 ♪ Take it to the hoop every chance we get, ♪ 
♪ 'cause when the sun goes down, ♪ 
♪ we're creatures of the net. ♪ 
 [girls screaming] 
 Get ready. Here they come again. 
 Stupid, screaming teens. 
 Been a pleasure serving with you. 
 Get him! 
 [all screaming] 
 Hi, I'm Katie. 
 I'm Dak? 
 [all screaming] 
 Come with me if you want to live. 
 Thanks. 
 [all screaming] 
 He's not in here. 
 Find Dak! 
 [all screaming] 
 All right, the pop tiger messenger is on his way. 
 Now, let's take this picture. 
 All: Wait! 
 No more waiting! 
 Gentlemen. 
 Now, smile pretty, pretty. 
 Well, maybe girls will like space matadors on a star-mobile holding stuffy puppies. 
 Both: They won't. 
 Well, this'll never work. 
 I've been hit. 
 Hey, look, it's Dak Zevon! 
 There he is! 
 [all screaming] 
 [camera shutter clicking] 
 [all screaming] 
 I can't believe that actually worked. 
 [all screaming] 
 Dogs, what is going on here? 
 Oh, we're saving our photo from Griffin. 
 [horn honking] 
 I'm here to pick up a photo card 
 for pop tiger magazine. 
 All: Coming right up. 
 Hey. 
 Ah. 
 Shoot it from the waist up. 
 Smile pretty, pretty. 
 All: Take the picture! 
 [camera shutter clicks] 
 [all moaning] 
 Huh. 
 Get to the part where you get your butts kicked and put meat on your faces. 
 We're getting to that. 
 [all sigh] 
 Here you go. 
 See you in pop tiger, boys. 
 All: Yes! 
 [engine revving] 
 I don't know what happened here today, but maybe we should leave the dogs alone more often. 
 Hey, guys, look who I found today. 
 I think she just saved my life. 
 That's Dak Zevon! 
 [all screaming] 
 Huh, who knew such a simple picture could bring you so close to death? 
 But it was totally worth it. 
 'cause we're going to be on the walls of millions of girls. 
 All over the country. 
 Of course you are. 
 'cause Dak Zevon is on the other side.
