 I told you, I'm not here to talk about Molly.    
 You think you're in love with her, but you've fallen in love with God's whisper.

 Facts and logic over emotion, mm?    
 That is our German soul.    
 Your arguments about the war and the Jews are filled with rage, not a worthy emotion for any man, much less a German.    
 That is not who we are.    
 The way you talk... like you're not even German.    
 Neither is the Fuehrer. He's Austrian.    
 When my little boy asks me about our plight, about our place in the world,    
 I tell him Germans believe in dignity for everyone.    
 We aren't animals.    
 To the Fatherland. Prost.    
 - Prost. 
- Prost.    
 - Prost. 
- Prost.

 You should've told me.    
 - Tiago... 
- She's my baby sister.    
 - I'll take care of her. 
- With what, your radio songs and your bullshit sermons?    
 Who the hell do you think you are?    
 Josefina confided in me.    
 She's just a kid!    
 She wanted to join the Temple, and I am in no place to deny her entry.    
 Why didn't you tell me?    
 You're so full of f*cking secrets.    
 I couldn't betray her trust.    
 My family doesn't need you.    
 I'll take care of my sister.    
 Leave.    
 You know this is never gonna work.    
 I know.    
 But I can't stop.    
 You should go.    
 [inhales deeply]    
 I need this to be real, Tiago.    
 So I choose to believe it is.

 Herman is right...    
 - What? 
- ...about everything, but I couldn't let him talk to you like that.    
 I can speak for myself.    
 I was embarrassed for you.    
 You are the Bund's leader. 
You must lead.    
 I need a new life, Peter, one where I'm not weak or frightened.    
 - Of course not. You don't... 
- Let me finish.    
 You helped me with...with my husband, and I'm... so grateful for that, but I am never being treated like that ever again by a German or a Jew.    
 I'm tired of living in that shame.    
 No, no more.    
 I will fight for my freedom and my country, and I need to know that you're strong enough to take care of Frank and me.    
 [scoffs] You doubt that, after what I did for you?    
 Then don't be afraid to be Deutsch.    
 I'm not.    
 But... perhaps we see this differently, you and I.    
 How's that?    
 Being a German is not marching with Hitler.    
 I want peace for Germany and for America.    
 This is why I speak out.    
 This is the purpose of the Bund.    
 So this is your strength, hmm?    
 Appease the Jews and the Bolsheviks and all those who starved us and ripped apart our country and still keep us under the boot.    
 Where is your pride?    
 [tires squealing]    
 My pride is in what I do for my family and for you and for the children I help as a doctor.    
 It is not in the Fatherland...    
 ...and it is not in my name.    
 Your name?    
 You know I was raised in Essen in the war.    
 It is also the home of the Krupp factories...    
 ...Germany's armorers for     years.    
 A dynasty it is.    
 For centuries now, the Krupp factories make the blades and the bullets and the cannons for all the wars.    
 Right now, Krupp is busy making panzer tanks and Stuka dive-bombers for Hitler.    
 They sell death to the world and always have.    
 My name... is not Peter Craft.    
 [sighs]    
 I am Peter Krupp.    
 In the war, I saw what those machines could do.    
 I was a medic, ja... and I saw the blood and the wounds.    
 And this is my family's legacy.    
 I can never escape it, but I will not embrace it.

 [Tiago] What's so damn important?    
 [Lewis sighs] I went to see Townsend.    
 He evaded badly.    
 He's up to his neck in whatever it is, but there was this big map of the new motorway in his office.    
 It came from a construction company called Via Hermosa Development, so I thought I might as well...    
 Wait, Miss Adelaide had one of those in her office too.    
 So they're working together to build the motorway?    
 What the f*ck's that about?    
 But here's the thing: after I saw the map,    
 I went to the hall of records to dig around about Via Hermosa, corporate filings and the like.    
 A lot of dummy paperwork and shell companies, but it all came down to one man,    
 Richard Goss.    
 The Nazis, City Hall, the Temple, the motorway.    
 What does this all add up to?    
 The future of Los Angeles.    
 So... I thought you and I should make a little nighttime visit to the Via Hermosa offices.
