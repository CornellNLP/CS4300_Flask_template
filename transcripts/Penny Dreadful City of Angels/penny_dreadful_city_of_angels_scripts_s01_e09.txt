 Previously, on "Penny Dreadful: City of Angels"... 
   You used to fight for your family,  - and now look at you - You sit,  and you don't say anything! 
   Mateo, come home now. 
   These people are not your family. 
   I can't talk to Mama or Raul or Tiago,  and now I don't even have you anymore. 
   You need to know I'm moving out. 
   I'm going to live at the Temple. 
   You know this is never gonna work. 
   I know, but I can't stop. 
   Councilwoman Beck has filed a petition  to have you recalled. 
   You have no talent. 
   What you do have is a family name. 
   Leave my father out of this. 
   For Reilly, this little piece of sh1t? 
   You're going to San Quentin. 
   Or just like that,  I'll make sure everyone knows  what kind of rat you are. 
   You kill them all? 
   Dottie's gonna take you home, and you'll stay with her. 
   Please don't let them hurt me. 
   The Nazis, City Hall, the Temple, the motorway... 
   What does this all add up to? 
   The future of Los Angeles. 
   I don't know that we can save her. 
   Save her? 
   We're just trying to survive her. 
   Oh, God. 
  Ow! 
   Just hold still. 
   My f*cking car. 
   They'll give you another car. 
   Ah, this is a V-12! 
   You know how much hustling I had to do to get a V-12? 
   Damn tragedy is what this is. 
   So who was it? 
   Better question: who doesn't want to kill us? 
   City Hall. 
   Townsend's a cream puff. 
   Doesn't have the nerve. 
   Maybe the Pachucos, revenge for Diego. 
   Tommy guns aren't their style. 
   The Temple. 
   I hardly think Miss Adelaide is... 
   I know what you think,  but you ask me, that woman's capable  of pretty much anything under the sun  and the big, black midnight. 
   Let me tell you, though. 
   For my money, this reeks of one thing  and one thing only. 
   So what do we do? 
   They come after us. 
   We go after them. 
   You ain't seen what I can do. 
   Look away, child. 
  Look away. 
   City of Angels Penny Dreadful  *Penny Dreadful City of Angels* Seaon 01 Episode 093  Episode Title :"Sing, Sing, Sing" Aired on: June 21, 2020  God, it could have been beautiful. 
   This thing, it's not just a road. 
   It's a vision. 
   This could've been LA. 
   With respect, sir, I do wonder  at your singular lack of moxie. 
   Moxie? 
   Oh, for f*ck's sake. 
  It's over. 
   Beverly's gonna get her goddamn route  for the motorway,  and all the spics are gonna celebrate,  and then they'll celebrate some more  because she's gonna get me recalled,  and then we're both gonna be out of a job. 
   The city council doesn't vote for another four days, sir. 
   - You still have time. 
  - For what? 
   They f*cking hate me! 
   The spics hate me,  and the city council hates me,  and the voters hate me. 
   I'm a fat, hateful man,  and nobody will ever love me, ever. 
   Why the f*ck should they? 
   I love you, sir,  and Kurt loves you. 
   Of that, I have no doubt. 
   Further still, the people of this city  will love you again. 
   You're going to save them, you see? 
   You're going to give them that beautiful future. 
   You must. 
  It's your birthright. 
   You have only one card left to play,  and you must. 
   The destiny of Los Angeles depends on it. 
   Talk to your father. 
   I didn't think  about what all this would do to the boys... 
   ...and my Tom especially. 
   It will take time. 
   Ja. 
   But what I did was so selfish. 
   I send their mother away, and I bring them you and Frank. 
   We should have waited, Elsa. 
   Peter Craft... 
   you are a good, true man. 
   We will see our way through. 
   And we start today, ja? 
   We will be a happy family like all the others. 
   What do happy families do, then? 
   They play games, maybe,  or go out together. 
   Ja, good. 
   Tonight after work,  you come home, and we will all go out  to the movies; that's what we'll do. 
   Why, look here. 
   This new Robin Hood picture. 
   Is he not the one your Tom likes so much? 
   Ja. 
   Ja, that book is our favorite. 
   Ah, this will make him happy. 
   A special treat for Tom, then. 
   We will all go downtown  and see this Robin Hood picture. 
   You go tell him. 
   And I'll tell him it was your idea. 
   Oh, look now. 
  I've made a mess. 
   I'll get it, ma'am. 
   How silly am I? 
   Very silly. 
   Don't you think I am a silly girl? 
   No, I do not. 
   What do you think I am, then? 
   When I know, I'll tell you. 
   When you know, it'll be too late. 
   I so hoped we could be friends. 
   You might as well howl to the moon. 
   Every drop now, you hear? 
  Every drop. 
   I need to see Mr. 
  Richard Goss. 
   Are you a member? 
   I'm a member of the LAPD. 
   I'm sorry, this club is restricted,  Detective Lewis... 
  Michener. 
   Yeah, my rabbi told me. 
   Sir. 
   Sir. 
   Mind if I join? 
   How's Adolf? 
   Invaded any countries lately? 
   You fellas know Mr. 
  Goss works for Adolf, right? 
   When he's not killing Jews, that is. 
   Gentlemen, will you excuse us? 
   Yeah, go grab a copy of Mein Kampf at the gift shop. 
   So... 
   this is what a restricted club looks like. 
   Mmm. 
   Ah. 
   I can see why you keep the riffraff out. 
   I could almost convert for a steak like that. 
   Detective Michener,  you have grossly overplayed your hand. 
   Pal, I haven't even gotten to the table yet. 
   But before they throw my Yid ass out of here,  this is what you gotta hear. 
   I know who you are, I know what you're doing,  and I know you tried to kill me. 
   So how about you do it now? 
   Safety's still on. 
   That's the little switch on the side. 
   These theatrics are so in keeping with your people. 
   Everything's such drama, isn't it? 
   Oh, yeah, we're aces on drama. 
   You know what else we're good at? 
   Staying alive,  just like roaches. 
   Keep stomping, and we'll just run to the corners. 
   You killed my friends,  you tried to kill me and my partner,  and here I am. 
   You may think you have an inkling  of what you're dealing with, but... 
   Spare me the speech. 
   Via Hermosa Development,  Councilman Townsend over at City Hall,  Sister Molly's Temple,  that place in Topanga. 
   I know exactly... 
   And young Brian Koenig. 
   I know you have him hidden. 
   But we will find him  and pry whatever secrets he holds  from that neurotic little brain. 
   Sure. 
   You bet. 
   But until then,  if you want to kill me,  how about you just kill me? 
   Not my partner, not my friends,  me. 
   Pick up the gun. 
   Spare us both the trouble. 
   I don't need to hurt you. 
   Oh, hey, that's good to know. 
   Your wife, Miriam, died years ago,  but your son, Felix, lives in Glendale. 
   He works in the shoe department at Bullock's. 
   You do not see him, or, more to the point,  he chooses not to see you. 
   Your daughter, Beth, lives in Millburn, New Jersey. 
   She has two children. 
  I cannot recall their names. 
   I'm not sure you've ever met them. 
   There's such estrangement in your family. 
   Your daughter is with child, by the way,  and so you're going to be a grandfather again. 
   Congratulations. 
   Oh, Daniel,  robust representative of your tribe,  you shall one day look back  on this trip into the lion's den  and weep for all you know  and all you've lost. 
   It's not the lions you have to look out for, pal. 
   It's us roaches. 
   I don't know. 
   Lewis wants me to stay out of sight. 
   I think he's worried about me. 
   He's a good man to have as a partner. 
   The best. 
   And back to work on Monday? 
   Yeah. 
  There's a ceremony. 
   We're gonna get citations for that Hazlett thing. 
   Congratulations. 
   We should go somewhere. 
   What do you mean? 
   Out somewhere. 
   Like where? 
   I don't know. 
   I mean, we walk up and down this beach,  and we stay inside the cottage so no one will see us. 
   It's like we're in prison. 
   I guess we are. 
   And what if I want to be free of it, all of it? 
   Honey, we can't go out in public. 
   You know that. 
   God Almighty, I'm so sick of it. 
   You remember when we went to the pier? 
   That's the day I fell in love with you,  because you let me be just plain Molly. 
   Oh, let me be her again. 
   Molly. 
   Just for one night. 
   - What do you have in mind? 
  - Anything, everything. 
   Let's just have fun, just like anyone else. 
   You really want to have some fun? 
   Mm-hmm. 
   Because I know just the place.

  He only has about ten minutes. 
   Sit down if you want. 
   I'm riding in a few minutes, so I'd appreciate brevity. 
   I need to talk about the motorway. 
   Beverly Beck's motorway, this is? 
   My motorway. 
   Hmm. 
   Then you're wasting your time here. 
   I need your help. 
   I've never come to you before. 
   I've never asked you for a damn thing,  not a single election, not a single vote. 
   - You know that. 
  - You need my influence  to persuade the city council  to adopt your route for the Arroyo Seco motorway. 
   That's what I need, Father. 
   Well, sit. 
   Sit. 
   Go ahead, son. 
   Three men built Los Angeles. 
   Mulholland brought the water,  Doheny found the oil,  and you built the roads. 
   Hmm. 
   When you came to this town,  you had a vision for what it could be. 
   You knew LA would grow and keep growing  and it would need to get around,  so you turned public transportation  into private transportation. 
   You bought the streetcars and the buses  and the cabs  and the property for the roads. 
   No one moves a block in this city  if they're not paying you. 
   Hmm. 
   What I'm doing with the motorways  is just the next logical step. 
   Those little red streetcars are yesterday's news. 
   The future is the automobile  and the roads they drive on,  a future we can control. 
   It's the family business, sir. 
   Not surprisingly, you have missed  the essence of the matter. 
   The future, as you so grandly put it,  isn't in your motorways. 
   That's all inevitable. 
   The future is up there. 
   Aviation. 
   I already own most of Mines airport  over in Inglewood and the land around it,  and I'm working on a bond issue  to add more runways and terminals  and make it the central airport  for all of Los Angeles. 
   When the war comes, which it will,  military's going to be pouring a fortune into aviation. 
   All that technology will be trickling down  into the private sector,  so after the war, planes are gonna be bigger,  cheaper, faster,  flying longer routes,  nonstop from LA to New York,  right over all those motorways of yours. 
   So you'll understand why the company  can't spare too much worry about your little road. 
   I'm not talking about the company. 
   I'm talking about you. 
   Please help me. 
   Oh, for God's sake, don't embarrass yourself. 
   Dad, just for a minute, please. 
   You've already lost. 
   Unless those Mexicans start rioting  and killing a bunch of white folk,  Beverly Beck has run the table. 
   She gets her route for the motorway. 
   You get recalled. 
   But with your support, I could win. 
   Well, you are assuredly correct about that. 
   Do let me make one thing inescapably clear. 
   The reason I'm not supporting you  isn't because you're a fat, ugly queer. 
   It's because you're weak,  and I never back a losing horse. 
   Good day. 
   I need to see him. 
   And you would be... 
   An old friend. 
   Detective Michener. 
   What do you think? 
   I bought the place from Lawrence Tibbett,  the baritone of note. 
   His design aesthetic was a bit rococo,  but the bones of the house, unbeatable. 
   Can I have a word? 
   Give us the room, gents,  and don't hang the chandelier until I'm there. 
   Of course, I looked in Bel Air and over in Pasadena,  but Beverly Hills is like the jugular of the town,  it seems to me. 
   Hey, tell me honestly,  does this place make me look nouveau riche? 
   f*ck yes. 
   Listen... 
  I need your help. 
   Ah, the menace of Germany again, huh? 
   Did we not have a rather desultory conversation  on this point? 
   Cut the crap. 
   I promise, I tell you what's going on,  you'll help. 
   You make me your friend,  it's for life. 
   Yeah. 
   For life. 
   I'm all ears. 
   - Mm. 
  - Gracias. 
   Speaking Spanish  Raul. 
   I don't know that it's all bad,  the motorway. 
   Maybe it'll do some good, hmm? 
   People can get to work faster. 
   Maybe business will come in, like around the train stations. 
   Or maybe it kills the whole neighborhood. 
   It doesn't matter anyway. 
   They're gonna move the road into the canyon. 
   Come on. 
   How's work? 
   That house is cursed. 
   I tried to help, but I... 
   I don't know what to do anymore. 
   Hell with it. 
   I'll pray tomorrow. 
   I was thinking about trying to go back to work,  bring in some money. 
   When you get better, okay? 
   When will that be? 
   So tired still. 
   What? 
   Ever since the hospital,  nothing feels the same. 
   It's like I have some kind of purpose now,  but I don't know what it is. 
   Okay. 
   It's decided. 
   Tonight you take your mama out. 
   - Mama... 
  - Now, come on! 
   We'll get dressed to the nines and hit the town. 
   I been in that bus for two hours  after fighting with a German witch  the whole day. 
   You don't think I deserve a night out? 
   Por favor, mijo. 
   Listen, just sit tight. 
   I'll be done in a couple of hours. 
   Don't you worry about us, Lewis. 
   I'm teaching the kid Mahjong. 
   Jesus. 
  Don't start betting. 
   He's a math genius, remember? 
   No one takes  Mrs. 
  Minter's little girl to the cleaners, hon. 
   See you later. 
   Let's go. 
   I want a nice, easy transfer. 
   The San Quentin boys will meet you at Union Station. 
   They're insufferable Bay Area pricks,  so be warned. 
   Noted. 
   Just put him on the train  and wave good-bye. 
   Remember, no grief. 
   No grief. 
   How you doing, kid? 
   f*ck you, puto. 
   That's the spirit. 
   King of San Quentin. 
  That's what you said. 
   Word's out you took the heat. 
   You're gonna own the place. 
   Let's go. 
   ♪ "Sing, Sing, Sing" playing ♪  Speaking Spanish  Vamos, hijo. 
  Vamos. 
   - Eso, muy bien! 
  - Hey, Mama. 
   Vamos. 
  Hey! 
   Ah. 
   Hey, hey! 
   - Mijo. 
  - Hey, Mama!

  - Ooh! 
   Sorry. 
   - Mama.

   What? 
  Oh, I thought it would look good. 
   You look gorgeous. 
   Hey, come on. 
  Let's sit down. 
   Excuse us, ladies. 
   My little girl, that hair, in this evil place. 
   I'm not drinking, just dancing with Mercedes and Ana. 
   Mm, don't lie to your mother. 
   My heart is so full, seeing you. 
   I miss you, baby. 
   Maybe you think about coming home? 
   If you knew how happy I was, you wouldn't ask. 
   Isn't that what you want for me? 
   Yes, that's what I want. 
   But... 
  maybe I teach you  a little bit about the mascara, hmm? 
   Mercedes did that. 
  I told her not so dark! 
   What? 
   What is it? 
   Familia. 
   Up to you, ese. 
   What did she do with her hair? 
   'Teo! 
   God, I missed you so much, 'Fina. 
   Uh, this is Rico and Rio. 
   - Yeah, hi. 
  - Your hair is killer. 
   Come on, chica. 
   Now, don't be like that, mama. 
   I'm not your mama,  if you even have one. 
   This is my brother Raul. 
   Hey, brother Raul. 
   So this is it? 
  You're all Pachuco now. 
   Hmm, in the sacred threads ass to crown, baby. 
   You're a joke. 
  You ought to be on the radio. 
   Easy. 
   Your baby brother's a man now. 
  Take it from me. 
   He's dressed like a man. 
   Don't. 
   That doesn't make you a man. 
   A man stays with his family. 
   He helps out at home. 
  He has some pride. 
   We don't need to fight about this, Mama. 
   We all find our pride in different ways, yeah? 
   When Raul went into the union, I remember you shouting  that he was gonna become a Bolshevik and get blown up,  and when Tiago joined the force,  do you remember those fights? 
   Josefina and this Temple,  which I don't understand one bit,  but she found her pride. 
   That's what you taught us. 
   Stand up. 
   Be a Chicano. 
   Be a Vega. 
   Maybe... 
   just be my mama for one night. 
   Okay? 
   We can fight tomorrow. 
   I worry about you,  out there in the city without me. 
   So it's growing up. 
   So it's getting hurt sometimes. 
   In a purple suit. 
   In a purple suit. 
   Anyone want a drink? 
   - Yes. 
  - Yes. 
   I tell you, baby, you got your brother's moves. 
   I tell you, baby,  I also got his back. 
   Six dot. 
   For all your smarts, you're lousy at Mahjong. 
   Well, maybe 'cause I'm not Chinese. 
   What, you think I am? 
   I did have a Chinese dog once,  one of those sausage dogs. 
   A dachshund? 
   That's a German dog. 
   Yeah, no, I don't think so. 
   I'm pretty sure. 
   It was my dog, honey. 
   Seven dot. 
   So how are your equations coming along? 
   You figuring things out? 
   Hmm? 
   Oh, yeah, I figured it out. 
   You figured it out? 
   The rocket, this would be? 
   Mm. 
   I'm working on something else now,  something much bigger. 
   Okay, time to go. 
  Get your things. 
   - Where are we going? 
  - I told you, somewhere safe. 
   I like it here. 
   You'll like it there. 
  Chop-chop, come on. 
   Mrs. 
  Minter, I take it. 
   Miss Minter. 
   Oh, so there's still a chance? 
   Don't try your sweet talk on me, fella. 
   Brian, shake a leg! 
   Are we gonna be late? 
   I don't want to miss the cartoons. 
   We won't be late. 
 
 
 
   Can you tell me the Robin Hood story? 
   Why do you want to know the story? 
   You're just about to see the movie. 
   Did I ever tell you about the very first movie  I ever saw? 
   When I was born, they didn't have them, even. 
   You're so old. 
   Ja. 
   So this man came to Essen  with a big tent, like a carnival man,  and he set up his projector machine,  and we all paid a couple of pfennigs. 
   How much is that? 
   Oh, say, a nickel. 
   And he switched on his lamp,  and he turned the handle,  and this flickering light showed us  pictures for the first time. 
   Who was in it? 
   Oh, no, this was before movie actors and... 
   just showed life. 
   Sounds boring. 
   Well, it wasn't boring, no. 
   It was the first time I saw the world, you see. 
   And I knew I could go there  and ride on trains and dance,  everything that wasn't... 
   my life. 
   But no more of that, huh? 
  Tonight is for Robin Hood, ja? 
   Ja! 
   You were born in Belvedere Heights? 
   No, Josefina was born in Belvedere Heights. 
   We were over in Sonoratown when I was born,  off Alameda Street,  all of us in this tiny little room,  no bathroom, no hot water. 
   But my parents worked like mules,  saving every penny  so we could finally move. 
   That's why we love the house so much. 
   Oh, I envy you that. 
   You have such a pride in where you're from. 
   You're a proper Angeleno. 
   Aren't you a proper Nebraskan? 
   No, I grew up in the back seat of my mother's car,  all over the Midwest, up into Canada sometimes. 
   Wherever the revival circuit went, that's where I lived. 
   God, I still live in a church. 
   Maybe we'll have a real house someday. 
   Don't look so anxious. 
   Not gonna take away your vaunted bachelorhood. 
   Please, take it. 
   Now, hop to. 
  We're almost there. 
   My Lord, what palace of vice are you taking me to? 
   Don't worry. 
  Place is a mob scene. 
   No one will even notice us. 
   Oh, please say you'll dance with me until dawn. 
   Let's see if we can get a table first, and then we... 
   Tiago? 
   Okay, um... 
  my mother's here. 
   - Your mother? 
  - Yes,  and my brother. 
   Well, should we not go say hello? 
   Oh, Molly, it's a complicated family. 
   It's a whole Chicano thing. 
   You've met my mother. 
  It's only fair. 
   You're a gringa, and you're you. 
   - Jesus, Molly... 
  - Well, I'm not ashamed. 
   Are you? 
   Mama! 
   Mijito. 
   This is Molly. 
   Molly, may I introduce you to my mother, Maria Vega,  and my brother, Raul Vega? 
   Hello. 
   Molly, a pleasure. 
   It's wonderful to meet you both. 
   Um, Tiago has told me so much. 
   Sit, sit. 
   What has he been telling you? 
   You know he's a born fibber. 
   We used to call him Pinocchio. 
   Already? 
   Do tell. 
   - Don't. 
  - This one here  is so good at the lies. 
   When he broke something, who got blamed for it? 
   Never innocent little Tiago. 
   He was a good boy. 
   He would make these big eyes,  and then a tear would start falling down his cheek,  just one, halfway down his cheek. 
   I have no damn idea how he did it. 
   And how did you two meet? 
   Yo sabes, through work. 
   Do you work in the station, then? 
   Oh, no, no. 
   I was working a case, and... 
   we just met when I was out. 
   Molly's in... 
  public service. 
   Ah. 
  Teacher? 
   - Partly, yes. 
  - Oh! 
   Mama. 
  A Chicano mother, you should know... 
   she's a mama bear at first. 
   You're never gonna be good enough for her angel. 
   But once you give her five or six grandkids... 
   Your words to God's ear. 
   Christ, I need a drink. 
   - Amen. 
  - What would you like, Molly? 
   Branch water, thanks. 
   Tequila? 
  Tequila for you? 
   - Claro. 
  - I'll be right back. 
   And no more stories about Pinocchio. 
   Speaking Spanish  Officer Vega. 
   You got nerve showing up here. 
   You got nerve showing up anywhere. 
   You gonna cuff me? 
   I'm off duty. 
   Me too. 
   Uh-uh, uh-uh. 
  Your money's ugly here. 
   These are on me. 
   Thanks. 
   Tomorrow I won't be off duty. 
   So it goes, amigo. 
   I mean it. 
   The three of us in this one room  the size of a phone booth,  little Mateo wetting the bed,  Tiago doing his crying act,  and I had to get up at damn five o'clock  to go to the cannery! 
   Oh, I swear, that makes me jealous. 
   I don't have any brothers or sisters. 
   I always wanted to be part of a big family. 
   Come be a Vega, God help you. 
   Sister Molly! 
   I know you now. 
   I know you. 
   Bad enough what you do to my little girl,  and now my son? 
   - No, ma'am. 
  - Mama. 
   Look, I don't think I can explain other than... 
   No, ma'am! 
   You take your gringa face out of my life. 
   You take your white God away from my girl. 
   You take your hands off my son. 
   - We do not need you! 
  - Hey, Mama, calm down. 
   Calm down. 
  Sit down. 
   You bring this woman here? 
   Sit down. 
   You show her some respect. 
   I should go. 
   Stay. 
  Please don't go, Molly. 
   Please. 
   Molly? 
   What is this? 
   Jesus Christ. 
   Sit down. 
   This is the woman makes you leave your family? 
   No, come on, 'Fina. 
  We don't need to do this. 
   Shut up, Mateo. 
  Sit down. 
   Josefina, let me explain. 
   f*ck him coming here. 
   - This place is for Chicanos. 
  - You lied to me. 
   You got no right to talk to me like that. 
   I'm sorry. 
  I didn't know what... 
   You should've told me. 
   What, you gonna shoot me? 
  Go on, you f*ck. 
   You gonna cut my throat? 
  Come on, Pachuco, here I am! 
   Both of you, shut up. 
   m*therf*cker. 
   Tiago, why do you do this to me? 
   Josefina... 
   - Don't blame him. 
  - Then you tell me. 
   Why are you here? 
  I don't understand. 
   Esta mujer is dating your brother. 
   This is your goddamn saint. 
   - Don't. 
  - Let them talk, Mama. 
   I should've told you. 
  I didn't know how. 
   Suddenly you can't find the words, you. 
   What kind of man are you,  to do this to your family? 
   Chicana girl not good enough for him,  - not for the white cop. 
  - Stop. 
   You've been running from us your whole life. 
   This is our skin, ese, yours and mine,  and nothing you do is gonna change that,  no matter how many gringa putas you f*ck. 
   All of you, stop! 
   I will not have this from you, from anyone. 
   My whole life,  I've been disappointing people. 
   I don't believe in God. 
   I don't believe in Santa Muerte. 
   I don't join the union. 
  I join the force. 
   I'm not Chicano enough. 
   I'm not white enough. 
   I'm not Catholic enough. 
   I'm not cop enough. 
   I'm not anything enough! 
   But what I am  is Tiago Vega,  and the woman I love sits here. 
   You can turn your backs, you can walk away right now,  but this is who I am. 
   Jesus. 
  You should have been a priest. 
   I love you, Tiago,  but you drive me mad all the time. 
   He's a Vega, hmm? 
   Three sons and no priest. 
   Explain that to me, someone. 
   Maybe she's the priest. 
   Maybe she is. 
   Maybe we start again, huh? 
   This is Molly Finnister,  Sister Molly. 
   Okay. 
   So this is a Mexican mother. 
   She says a lot and really loud. 
   Loud. 
   But if Tiago says he cares for you,  that matters. 
   He's my soul. 
   They all are. 
   And I would never do anything to hurt him  or your daughter. 
   Please believe me. 
   She's telling the truth. 
   This all with Tiago, I don't understand... 
   but she is a good woman. 
   I love you, Mateo mio. 
   We talk sometime, you and me, yeah? 
   Promised this lady a dance. 
   Make a joyful noise unto the Lord. 
   Amen, sister. 
   Hey, come on, 'Fina, you and me. 
   Let's show them how it's done, Mama. 
   Old lady like me? 
   Bband playing "Sing, Sing, Sing" plays... 
   Yeah, you know what you're doing? 
   - No. 
  - No? 
  Check this out. 
   Yay! 
  Vamos, familia! 
   Yeah!
