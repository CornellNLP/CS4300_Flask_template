 [announcer]  Previously on  Penny Dreadful: City of Angels.   
 - Sister Molly was f*cking Hazlett. 
- You don't know that.   
 [Lewis]  Take the valise. 
You run it down and tell me I'm wrong.   
 [Peter]  My boy Tom is having a birthday party this Sunday.   
 Bring Frank,  and he will have friends. 
Do say you'll come, yeah?   
 No, no.   
 [Townsend]  Councilwoman Beck's

 We need to do something about her.    
 Really, sir, your audacity is truly as Herculean as your appetite.    
 [Alex] You know what he'll do now.    
 [Goss]  Let him sneak a chocolate malt.   
 [Alex]  If it were only a malt.   
 You need to conclude the Hazlett case.    
 You want us to conclude the Hazlett case, not solve it?    
 That is entirely correct.    
 [Reilly]  What are you crying about?   
 - Officer Reilly. 
- [Mateo]  I never seen anything like it.   
 He was so smooth.   
 Brother, when are we gonna get active?    
 We have to fight.

 You cuffed him to a chair?    
 Cocksucker tried to bite me.    
 Stay away from him, or I'll f*cking kill you!

 Reilly, put him back in the pen, and get the blood off him. Jesus Christ.    
 Are we arresting every goddamn Chicano in the city?

 Close the door.

 Steve's about the same age as that boy you had cuffed to a chair.    
 Officer Reilly was interrogating a suspect, and he'll go on doing that till he gets someone to confess.    
 What the hell are you doing, Detective?    
 Lewis said Hazlett might have been cooking the books, shacking up with some gal in a love nest, right?    
 I'm running it down.    
 When's Lewis back?    
 Couple of days, he said.    
 Oh, Jesus, you two.

 Will you stop the interrogations?    
 Give me a reason to.    
 Go do your job. Dismissed.    
 [frustrated exhalation]    
 [Townsend]  So I'm pleased to report  that Via Hermosa Development has agreed to take over the construction of the motorway at no additional cost.    
 We should be able to break ground as soon as the full City Council votes next month.    
 I expect the Council will approve our recommendations in full because they understand the Maynard West Memorial Motorway    
 will begin the process of healing this city and will be a legacy of which we can all be proud.    
 Now, if there's nothing else...    
 Point of order, Mr. Chairman.    
 Councilwoman Beck?    
 You know what's interesting?    
 I took a little drive out to Belvedere Heights the other day, stretch my legs a bit, and something sort of struck me.    
 Ken, if you will.    
 [uneasy music]    
 ♪   
 Now, you all recognize this line here.    
 That's the route of the motorway.    
 But I talked to some engineers,     
 put some questions to them, and those clever gentlemen came up with this.     
 As you can see, this route entirely bypasses Belvedere Heights and goes through the hills here,     
 the hills where no one lives but a few coyotes and jackrabbits, none of whom vote.     
 Now, I'll grant you this.     
 It'll add about four minutes to the drive to Pasadena. Four minutes.     
 But if our goal is truly to heal this city, as you said, Mr. Chairman, I can't imagine those four minutes will make much of a difference.     
 Don't you agree?     
 And after speaking with my many old friends on the City Council and in the mayor's office, I can assure you, they also agree.     
 Sir, we can fight this, put our own engineers...     
 Cancel my speech tonight.     
 Oh, we can't cancel this evening, sir. We need...     
 Do what I tell you, woman!     
 [Lewis]  This Nazi...   I know he killed them.   
 I just can't prove it yet.   
 So what do you do now about Anton and Sam?     
 [sighs]     
 I talk... to Benny Berman.     
 This doesn't surprise you?     
 You know who was president when I was born?     
 Ulysses S. Grant.     
 Not a lot surprises me.     
 But this is a gangster you're talking about.     
 - He's a Jew. 
- You better hope he's a good Jew.     
 This is about a lot more than Anton and Sam now.     
 These Germans...     
 It's terrible, what I know.     
 I need help.     
 You got me.

 So he's working on a new rocket with a big engine called the V- , and everyone's racing to catch up,     
 including a bunch of kids at Caltech over in Pasadena.     
 So just for the sake of argument, let's say these kids beat the Krauts to it.     
 They figure out how to make this big new rocket fly.     
 And say the Germans steal that science and get it back to Berlin.     
 And what do you know, Mr. Hitler suddenly has a rocket that can reach London and Jerusalem and New York.

 [Rico] What do you expect?     
 Things like this happen all the time, Mateo.     
 This was two blocks away from our house, and I couldn't do a f*cking thing.     
 My sister, man.     
 Reilly's one bad cop.     
 Are there any other kind?     
 My brother's a cop.     
 Oy.     
 Someone gotta teach     
 that fat man a lesson.     
 [Mateo] f*cking right.     
 But we sit here, and we talk, and we talk, and we play cribbage.     
 [Rico] What do you have in mind, baby?

 [Bernadette] Reilly keeps these little girls down Sonoratown, puts them on smack, and they're his bitches.     
 I know the one now, Sofia.     
 She was a good girl.     
 You know the place?     
 Over on Alameda.     
 This was my sister, Rico.     
 Yes.

 Let's do what Pachuco do.     
 Raise your voice! I hear you.     
 Raise your voice. The Lord hears you.

 You must be heard. Sing out!

 Let me hear you!

 These are the days of roses and thorns, and we need your voice, we need your prayers, because Satan walks outside that door...     
 [audience grumbles]     
 ...that beast who tempts us and teases us and pulls us down, down, down to the everlasting pit where the crown of thorns rips at our skin.     
 We must fight him.     
 We must stand up and be heard!     
 We can no longer be weak and powerless.     
 Women, do you hear me?     
 [women] Yes.     
 [Molly] I was once as you are now, afraid and unheard.     
 But sisters, I learned to stand up.     
 [all] Yes!     
 Who will stand up with me now?     
 Stand up and be heard!     
 Raise your head.     
 Raise your voices!     
 - Amen! 
- [Molly] Lord, children, do it now, for the beast, Satan, is here!     
 [audience gasps]     
 Can't you hear him walking?     
 He is here.     
 He is here.     
 He is here!

 You are not safe. Lord, save us.

 May I introduce you to Leonard Schiff, a member of our organization on the outs right now, you could say.     
 Now, at our last interview, you mentioned Mr. Lansky's support for the Zionist cause. You recall?     
 Yeah.     
 Well, couple days ago, our Mr. Schiff here makes his way down to old Mexico and hijacks a shipment of Mr. Lansky's weapons intended for Palestine...     
 Kills two good guys in the process and a boatload of spics.     
 Now, can you guess what he did with those weapons?     
 Go on, guess.     
 I don't know.     
 I'm sorry. Can't hear you.     
 I don't know.
