-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
 [Scene: At a gym. Two guys are boxing in a boxing ring. Gabriel walks in. One of the boxer's brutally punches the other and the referee stops the fight.] 
 [Time lapse. Luther Stubbs is putting his stuff in a bag. Gabriel walks up to him.] 
 Gabriel: Luther Stubbs. 
 Stubbs: Yeah, who wants to know? 
 Gabriel: I'm a fan. I saw your bout in St. Louis three years ago. Bloodiest fight I've ever seen. Hear the boxer didn't even make it to the hospital. Died in the ring. 
 Stubbs: Yeah, well, you know. Everybody gotta go sometime. 
 Gabriel: I wanna know what it felt like to take another life with your own hands. 
 Stubbs: The guy didn't even cut me, man. Now move. 
 Gabriel: Not till I get what I came for. 
 Stubbs: And what might that be? 
 Gabriel: Your killer instinct. 
 (Gabriel gets his crystal sword out stabs him. A bright light shines out of Luther's body and into Gabriel's sword.) 
 [Scene: Manor. Prue and Piper walk in the house through the front door.] 
 Piper: And since it's time for Quake's yearly inventory, I have to count everything in the restaurant down to the last wissel stick. It's gonna take days. 
 Prue: I guess that's why you get paid the medium sized bucks. 
 Piper: And which bucks would those be exactly? 
 (Prue notices a statue standing in the living room.) 
 Prue: Okay, okay, what's wrong with this picture? 
 Piper: Beside from me not getting paid enough. 
 Prue: No. What is grams' statue still doing in the living room? 
 Piper: We talked about it last night remember? 
 Prue: Yes, I do remember, and I thought that we agreed that it was an issore and she was going back to storage. 
 Piper: That is before I learned that storage down town is now 90 bucks a month and storage here is free. So, I called Phoebe and decided that she can stay here and last time I checked we were still living in a democracy. 
 Prue: Okay, but Piper, she's ugly. 
 Piper: Majority rules, sis. Unless, you can move her. 
 (Prue tries to move her with her power. She can't.) 
 Prue: Oohh... okay, okay, that didn't work. 
 Piper: It's solid marble. It took eight of Phoebe's bouncer friends to move it. It's too heavy for you. 
 Prue: You know, my powers are still growing and one day...  
 Piper: You can move it into the basement. But until then suffer. 
 Phoebe: (from other room) Eeyah! 
 Prue: Phoebe. 
 [Cut to the living room. Phoebe is kicking and punching a dummy.] 
 Prue: Phoebe? 
 Phoebe: Ooh, hi. I uh... I was just, uh... 
 Piper: Opening up a can of whoop ass. 
 Prue: Yeah, those are some serious moves. Where did you learn that? 
 Phoebe: Okay, I'm busted, I confess. I got tired of being the one in the family with the passive power, so I started taking up self defense classes which I've been putting on my new credit card. 
 Piper: And, uh, this thing? 
 Phoebe: Oh, that's Slam-man. Got him off an infomercial. 
 Prue: Great, another issore. 
 Phoebe: It's a total and complete martial arts training system. And with their easy instalment payment plan... 
 Piper: Which you also put on your new credit card. 
 Phoebe: He's gonna pay for himself the first time I kick ass on some unsuspected gnarly beast. Come on, wanna see some moves? 
 (Phoebe holds up her fists.) 
 Piper: No. 
 Phoebe: Come on. Come on. (Prue uses her powers and moves the dummy so it hits Phoebe.) You know that is so unfair. 
 Prue: Hey, demons do not play fair. (Phoebe gets Prue in an arm lock.) Okay, okay, okay, okay. 
 Phoebe: I didn't hear you say it. 
 Prue: Pheebs, let go. 
 (Phoebe has a premonition. Gabriel stabs Prue with his crystal sword.) 
 Piper: Phoebe, what is it? 
 Prue: What did you see? 
 Phoebe: I saw you die. 
 Opening Credits 
 [Scene: Manor. Kitchen. Phoebe is sitting at the table drawing the sword she saw in her premonition. Piper walks in.] 
 Piper: Hi. 
 Phoebe: Hi. 
 Piper: (Pours herself a cup of coffee.) I'm gonna need a lot more of this. 
 Phoebe: You couldn't sleep either, huh? 
 Piper: No, I was up all night. I couldn't get that image of Prue getting killed out of my head. Is that the sword? 
 Phoebe: Yeah, I drew it from memory. Unfortunately, I can't find it in the Book of Shadows yet. I wish that thing had an index. 
 Piper: I wish you had a closer look at the killer's face. 
 Phoebe: Well, if somebody tries to impale my sister, they're gonna have to get through me. 
 (Prue walks in.) 
 Prue: Oh, good, coffee. 
 (She pours some in a cup.) 
 Phoebe: Uh, why are you dressed up? 
 Prue: Because they don't have casual day at Bucklands. 
 Piper: Wait, you promised you would stay home so we could figure this out. 
 Prue: Yeah, and then Claire called and she has a client that wants to put a major collection on the block and if we get this account it will be a serious screw for Bucklands. 
 Piper: Can't Claire get somebody else to do it? 
 Prue: Piper, I have worked so hard to get Claire to trust me with something like this, why should someone else get all the glory? 
 Phoebe: Take the master demon that wants you dead for a hundred, Bob. 
 Piper: I can't believe you would risk your life to impress your boss. You can not leave this house. 
 Prue: Okay, relax. Phoebe's had premonitions before and we've affected the outcome, right? 
 Phoebe: That's true, but...  
 Prue: And in your premonition it was man who killed me, well, I'm going to Bucklands to meet a female client and Claire will be with me every step of the way, besides now that you've warned me, I'll watch my back. I can handle this promise. 
 Piper: The promise that we want from you is that you'll come straight home from Bucklands. 
 Prue: Will it stop you from worrying? 
 (They sign with their fingers to show a little bit.) 
 [Scene: Bucklands. Prue and Claire are walking down the hallway.] 
 Claire: The client's in my office. Now remember what I told you on the phone. 
 Prue: This woman's family has more money than God and if we land this account, it could put Bucklands in the black for years. 
 (They stop outside Claire's office.) 
 Claire: Exactly. You ready? 
 Prue: Of course I am. 
 (They walk inside. The client is waiting there.) 
 Claire: Helena Statler. I would like you to meet Prue Halliwell. One of our best and brightest young specialists. 
 Helena: Best and brightest? That's quite an introduction. 
 Prue: Yes it is. Maybe I should get a raise? 
 Claire: Let's have a seat shall we? 
 Helena: Miss Halliwell, my brother and I hold an extensive collection of antiquities. If we were to retain your firm, you'd be cataloguing and praising and selling the finest pieces you'd seen in your career. Maybe your life. 
 Prue: Just what kind of collection are we talking about exactly? 
 Helena: The kind that occupies three buildings at Warehouse Flats. We have art and artefacts from every period and movement in history. From Egyptian mummies to Jasper Jonce. We would want a sample appraisal of course. 
 Claire: Oh, Prue will be there today if you like? 
 Prue: At the warehouse flats? 
 Helena: Is that a problem? 
 Prue: No. No, I'm sure that I can handle it. 
 [Scene: Quake. Piper's talking to an employee.] 
 Piper: Twelve potato ricers? What kind of restaurant needs twelve potato ricers? Just put them in the back with the box with the lemon ringers.  
 (He leaves. Phoebe walks up to her.) 
 Phoebe: I just called Bucklands and they said that Prue left the office for a meeting. 
 Piper: What? She promised she would go straight home. 
 Phoebe: Wait, it gets worse. I finally found the crystal sword in the Book of Shadows... 
 Piper: Shh... 
 Phoebe: It's the symbol of the Lord's of War. They're a clan of super natural warriors. They've been around since time began. 
 Piper: What do they want? 
 Phoebe: To start war. They started most of the major wars in history and once they're done in one place, they get reincarnated in some other part of the world and start all over again. 
 Piper: So, is he flesh and blood? 
 Phoebe: Yes, but the book says as long as they have their sword they're not only protected, they're immune to the weapons of man. 
 Piper: So, we have this invulnerable guy running around with a sword who wants to start a war? 
 Phoebe: Well, the Lord's of War may be invulnerable but they do have a code of honour and when one of them is disgraced, he has to steal his abilities back. 
 Piper: So, what does this have to do with Prue? 
 Phoebe: One of the things he has to steal back is the magic of a first born witch. They're supposed to be the strongest. 
 (An employee comes up to Piper.) 
 Employee: Uh, Piper, where...? 
 Piper: Not now, not now. (He walks away.) Okay, I'll call the night shift manager, see if he can cover for me, you call Prue on her cell phone. We gotta find her. Quickly. 
 Commercial Break 
 [Scene: Warehouse Flats. Prue arrives in her car. She walks inside a dark building.] 
 Prue: Miss Statler? Miss Statler? 
 (Helena walks out from a dark croner.) 
 Helena: Hello, Miss Halliwell. (Prue's phone rings and she turns it off.) Oh, I'm sorry, I hope I didn't scare you. 
 Prue: No, I don't really scare that easily. 
 Helena: So, what do you think of our collection? 
 Prue: I think you have exquisite taste. 
 Helena: My brother and I have been collecting our entire lives. It's our binding passion. 
 Prue: Is this a Roman vessel? 
 Helena: Why don't you tell me? 
 Prue: I've never seen one in such good condition. The handles represent Venus and the relief detail scenes of Roman bass and Kara Koa. It probably dates back to 210 B.C. It's very rare and priceless. 
 Helena: Wow, Claire was right, you really are something. What can you tell me about this item? 
 (Prue walks over to a table. A pillory is on it.) 
 Prue: It's a pillory. The markings are constiant, so I say it dates back to the inquisition. (She puts her arms in the holes.) But it's missing a piece. 
 Helena: The victims arms were held in place by a bolt of restraint. (Steel rods shot across the top of the arm holes and traps her arms inside.) Prue Halliwell, my brother Gabriel. 
 (Gabriel walks in the room.) 
 Gabriel: I'd shake your hand but it's clearly otherwise engaged. 
 Prue: What are you doing? 
 Helena: Killing a witch. 
 Gabriel: Your ancestor's power animated from her hands. No doubt yours does too. 
 Prue: My ancestor? 
 Helena: A witch named Brianna. You're not the only one that's done research. (Prue frees her hands by using her power and throws Miss Statler against the wall. She grabs an axe and hits Gabriel in the chest. It doesn't harm him. Prue runs outside and drives off in her car.) How did she do that? 
 Gabriel: She's not like her ancestor, she channels her power through her eyes, not her hands. I won't make that mistake again. 
 Helena: She knows about us now. We have to move fast to attack her at home. 
 Gabriel: No, home is where she has the power of three to protect her. We'll think of another way. 
 [Scene: Manor. Living room. Prue and Piper are there.] 
 Prue: I hit Gabriel in the chest with an axe and he didn't even wink. 
 Piper: As long as he has his sword, he's immune to the weapons of man. Which we could've told you if you hadn't turned off your cell phone. 
 Prue: Well, I got away and I'm fine. 
 (Phoebe comes down the stairs with the Book of Shadows.) 
 Phoebe: Okay, I found our ancestor Brianna. She was our great, great, great aunt. She could move things with her mind like Prue. Now, she disgraced Gabriel during the premium war, she used her power to take away his sword. I guess Gabriel is trying to earn his abilities back. 
 Prue: Great. So, some guy couldn't keep it in his sheath and now I'm marked for death. 
 Piper: Well, some men are very sensitive about their weapons. 
 Phoebe: Lords of War and their weapons and their weapons are supposed to be inseparable like Thor and his hammer and I guess Brianna was able to send his sword hundreds of miles away. 
 Prue: Alright, sword I can move, but hundreds of miles away? I'm not that powerful. 
 Phoebe: I thought about that and I found this incantation. To multiply your strength, recite these words at length. 
 (Phoebe shows Prue a page in the Book.) 
 Prue: Alright, so all I have to do is say this incantation and I'll be stronger. 
 Phoebe: Hopefully strong enough to separate Gabriel and his sword. 
 Prue: Sounds like a plan to me. 
 Piper: Uh, time out. Bad idea. 
 Phoebe: Why, because it's mine? 
 Piper: No, because there might be a power of three solution to this. 
 Prue: Yeah, but the Book of Shadows doesn't say that. And besides it's me he's after not you and Phoebe. 
 Piper: Okay, okay, maybe we should lay low for a few days, you know, use up our sick days. 
 Prue: And wait for Gabriel to find us? And he might hurt one of you to get to me and I will not take that risk. (She stands up.) 
 Piper: Okay, Prue, but wait, okay wait, at least let us vote on this. 
 Prue: Alright. All in favour of me saying the incantation raise their hands. (Phoebe and Prue raise their hands.) Sorry sis, majority rules. (She goes upstairs.) 
 Piper: But Prue... 
 Prue: (to herself) "Take my powers blessed be, multiply their strength by three." 
 (Piper gives Phoebe a look.) 
 Phoebe: What? 
 Piper: You know what. 
 Phoebe: I'm sorry but I really don't have a problem with Prue saying the incantation. 
 Piper: The problem is we're in this together and together we're supposed to solve our problems. 
 Phoebe: And together we rely on the the Book of Shadows when we're in trouble. Think about it, Piper, what's the worst thing that could happen? (They hear thunder coming from the attic.) 
 Piper: What did I tell you? (They run up the stairs.) 
 [Cut to the attic. Prue is kneeling on the floor. There is a light swirling around her.] 
 Piper: Oh my God! 
 Phoebe: Oh my God! 
 (Prue multiplies. The three Prue's stand up.) 
 Phoebe: Prue? 
 All three Prue's: What? 
 Phoebe: Okay. (she counts) 1, 2, 3. 
 Commercial Break 
 [Scene: Manor. Phoebe and Piper are standing in front of the bathroom door.] 
 Phoebe: Hello? There are other people in this house that have styling needs too. 
 Piper: Is there a Prue in there also? 
 Phoebe: One of them, yes. 
 Piper: I'm gonna have to wash my hair in the kitchen sink if I want to get to work on time. Do you know which is the real Prue yet? 
 Phoebe: Oh, I don't know. It could be the upstairs bathroom hogging Prue, or the downstairs bathroom hogging Prue, or the sitting in the kitchen drinking all the coffee Prue. 
 (Prue comes out of the bathroom.) 
 Prue: Is there a problem? 
 Piper: Aside from you going off and casting a spell that's kept all our bathrooms busy for the past three hours. Nothing. 
 Prue: Don't blame me, I didn't cast the spell. 
 Phoebe: Great, you're a clone. 
 Prue: Well, no, I'm not exactly a clone, I mean I do have all of Prue's memories up until the time she cast the spell, so, in a lot of ways I am Prue. 
 Piper: Then it is your fault. 
 Prue: No, it's not, and neither is the lack of hot water. 
 (Prue walks away.) 
 Phoebe: Oh, you didn't. Geez. 
 Piper: This is ridiculous. This is like, this is like the 'Parent Trap' with a B cup. 
 Phoebe: I think I might've just found a way to take some of the Disney out of our life. 
 [Cut to the foyer. All three Prue's are there.] 
 Prue #1: You look great. 
 Prue #2: No, you look great. 
 Prue #3: Is my skirt tight enough? 
 Prue #2: Yes. 
 Prue #1: It's perfect. 
 (Phoebe and Piper come down the stairs.) 
 Phoebe: Okay, which one of you is the real Prue? 
 (They all raise their hands.) 
 Piper: Stop that. 
 Prue #1: I'm the real Prue. 
 Phoebe: Okay, then you get the black sweater. 
 (Phoebe hands her a sweater.) 
 Prue: Phoebe, what are you doing? 
 Phoebe: I'm colour coding. It's the only way we're gonna be able to tell the three of you apart. Okay, clone A gets the pink sweater... 
 (She hands it to her.) 
 Pink Prue: Thank you. 
 Phoebe: And B gets the blue one. 
 Blue Prue: Thanks. 
 Piper: Handy with the sweaters. 
 Phoebe: Thanks. But it's only a temporary solution. 
 Piper: And what about the spell? 
 Pink Prue: Oh, the spell's temporary too. We're only here as long as we're needed. 
 Blue Prue: We were called for a reason. Once the reason's gone the spell wears out and we disappear. 
 Pink Prue: Once we vanquish Gabriel. 
 Piper: And how are we planning on doing this? 
 Pink Prue: Funny you should ask, see I was thinking... 
 Blue Prue: Tthat we could find Gabriel by tracking down the ownership records for that Roman vessel. 
 Pink Prue: And Bucklands antiquities data base. 
 Real Prue: That's why I called my assistant... (Pink Prue clears her throat) our assistant and she's already on it. 
 Blue Prue: Are we good or what? 
 Piper: So, once you know where he lives are you sure you have the power to do the job? 
 Real Prue: Observe. Ladies, shall we. (All three Prue's use their powers and lift up the marble statue.) Enough said. 
 (The doorbell rings.) 
 Pink Prue: I'll get that. 
 (The phone rings.) 
 Blue Prue: I'll get the phone. 
 Real Prue: Wait, I should... 
 [Cut to Pink Prue opening the door.] 
 Pink Prue: Andy, hi. 
 Andy: Hi, can I come in? 
 Pink Prue: Now's not really a good time. Wow, that is a nice tie. 
 Andy: Thanks. 
 Pink Prue: So, um, what did I do now? 
 Andy: I don't know, you tell me. 
 Pink Prue: What ever it is, I have an alibi. 
 Andy: Good thing this is a social call then. 
 Pink Prue: Social call? Really? Now you're starting to look suspicious. 
 Andy: Remember a few months ago we ordered tickets to the Bay Area Music Awards? They came in the mail. Thought you might want them. 
 Pink Prue: That is so sweet. 
 Andy: You can take anyone you want. Even an old boyfriend who's just a friend now but who loves good music. 
 Pink Prue: I'll take that under consideration. 
 Andy: He pondered that. (They smile.) I'll see ya. 
 (He leaves and pink Prue closes the door.) 
 Pink Prue: Why did we break up with him? 
 Real Prue: He broke up with us first, remember? 
 Pink Prue: Too bad. 
 (Blue Prue slams down the phone.) 
 Blue Prue: Houston, we have a problem. 
 Phoebe: Raging clone hormones? 
 Blue Prue: No. That was Claire calling. She said that if I, well, one of us, don't get to the office pronto, you'll be looking for a new job. 
 Real Prue: Okay, okay, we can swing this. 
 Piper: No, no, no, wait. You're not seriously thinking of leaving the house? 
 Phoebe: You can't hide three you's at the office. 
 Blue Prue: Two of us may not be able to separate Gabriel from his sword but we can certainly fight him off. 
 Pink Prue: Which means two of us can go save Prue's job and whoever's left behind can go to the Quake with Piper. 
 Piper: Oh, no, no, no, no. Forget it. 
 Real Prue: Piper, you have an acting power, and besides Phoebe, your premonition, it didn't happen at Quake, right? 
 Phoebe: I can't be sure. 
 Real Prue: Still, worst case scenario, Piper freezes Gabriel and she runs. 
 Piper: No, no, I don't like this idea. I don't like it at all. I think we should all stay together, all five of us. 
 Phoebe: I think Piper's right. The book said it requires the strength of three to take on Gabriel. It's not safe to split up. 
 Real Prue: Okay, all who don't like the plan? (Piper and Phoebe raise their hands.) All who do? Wow, once again majority rules. 
 Commercial Break 
 [Scene: Bucklands. The real Prue and Pink Prue are walking down the hallway. Real Prue is holding a magazine in front of her face. Pink Prue pushes Real Prue behind a wall and Pink Prue walks up to her assistant.] 
 Pink Prue: Hi, is Claire around? 
 Assistant: She's been buzzing every fifteen minutes. You want me to get her? 
 Pink Prue: Not yet. Did you dig up the information on the Roman vessel? 
 Assistant: Hot off the laser jet. (She hands her a piece of paper.) 
 Pink Prue: Gabriel Statler's address. Good, okay, now I need for you to get me photocopies of all my sales files for the quarter. 
 Assistant: That could take hours. 
 Pink Prue: You're right. You know what, I need you to get me copies of everyone's files. 
 (She guides her out of the room.) 
 Assistant: But that could take days. 
 Pink Prue: Well, you better start now. Bye, bye. 
 (Pink and Real Prue walk into their office.) 
 Real Prue: Did you have to make her to photocopy all the files? 
 Pink Prue: You wanted her to see us together? 
 Real Prue: No, but you didn't even thank her, and you were so bossy. 
 Pink Prue: That's why we're called bosses. Alright, well now that we have Gabriel Statler's address... 
 Real Prue: No. You stay here, I will talk to Claire first. 
 Pink Prue: Why do you get to talk to Claire? 
 Real Prue: Because I still have to work here when all of this is over. 
 Claire: (from outside) Prue, are you there? 
 Both: Claire! 
 (Pink Prue pushes real Prue behind the door.) 
 Pink Prue: Claire, hi. 
 Claire: I want an explanation for yesterday. 
 Pink Prue: What do you mean? 
 Claire: Helen Statler called to tell me that she was so offended by your behaviour that she's taking her collection to Kristy's. What happened? 
 Pink Prue: Claire, um, I've already made arrangements to make a personal apology and put Bucklands back in the running. As a matter of fact, I convinced Miss Statler to meet me at her estate. See, here's the address. (She looks at the paper.) 
 Claire: Okay, you really think you can get this account back? 
 Pink Prue: I'd stake my job on it. 
 Claire: Good, because you just did. Alright, I'll get my briefcase and we'll take my car. 
 Pink Prue: No! 
 Claire: No? Oh, yes, yes, yes. I'm not gonna leave you alone with that client again. (She leaves.) 
 Real Prue: What was that? 
 Pink Prue: Hail Mary pass. 
 Real Prue: Okay, alright, let us think, um, I got it. I will take Claire to the wrong address, pretend we've been stood up or something. You call the other one of us at Quake. 
 Pink Prue: I love it when I'm so decisive. 
 Real Prue: Okay, look, you go get the other Prue and take her to the manor. Okay, and we'll finish this. (She dials the phone.) Hey, yeah, Pheebs, it's me. No, the real one. I'm just checking in. 
 Pink Prue: We do that a lot don't we? Check in with our sisters, make sure they're okay. Don't you think if there were a problem, they would call us and let us know? 
 Real Prue: Phoebe, I'll call you back. I have to go yell at myself. 
 (She hangs up.) 
 Claire: (from outside) Prue? 
 (Real Prue pushes pink Prue behind the door.) 
 Real Prue: Hi, hi. Ready to go? 
 Claire: Wow, did you change your sweater? 
 Real Prue: Yeah, black's more my colour. Come on. 
 [Scene: Quake. The phone rings. Piper answers it.] 
 Piper: Thank you for calling Quake. 
 Pink Prue: Hi Piper, it's me. 
 Piper: What colour? 
 Pink Prue: The pink one. The real Prue just left with Claire, look, I need you to get the blue one to the manor. We're meeting Prue there before we go to Gabriel's estate. 
 Piper: I've been thinking, have you guys thought about what happens after you separate Gabriel from his sword? 
 Pink Prue: Well, the book said she took the sword away and that was it. Why? 
 Piper: Well, what if he still comes after you? He's a warlord remember? 
 Pink Prue: Once we get the sword we'll destroy him. He would be crazy to take us on. Piper, don't worry. We have a plan and we have powers. 
 Piper: I just don't want to lose you... any of you. 
 Pink Prue: You won't. I promise. Bye. 
 (Piper hangs up and walks into the kitchen.) 
 Piper: The pink... (Piper sees Blue Prue eating spaghetti with her fingers. Two cooks are watching her looking very turned on.) one just called and wants you to meet her. Prue, what are you doing? 
 Blue Prue: Trying today's special. (to a chef) I think it needs a teeny bit more parmagian. 
 (She licks her fingers.) 
 Piper: I'm sure it's fine because today's special is glazed shortbread. 
 Blue Prue: Forget the parmagian because if anybody knows food, it's my Piper. (to a chef) What's your speciality? 
 Piper: Alright, come on you guys get to work, there you go, yeah I know, it's thrilling. Alright. 
 Blue Prue: Yeah, I guess I shouldn't pet the help. 
 Piper: What has gotten into you? Who has gotten into you? Because you're nothing like the real Prue. 
 Blue Prue: Actually, I'm exactly like the real Prue, just the side that doesn't get to come out and play enough. I'm the flip side of the corporate, conservative clone. 
 Piper: Alright, that's enough, get out of my kitchen before my cooks overheat. (She offers Piper some spaghetti) I don't want that. Yuh uh. 
 [Scene: Bucklands car park. Pink Prue comes out of the elevator. Some sort of bomb roles down the stairs and blows up giving off a bright light which blinds pink Prue.] 
 Gabriel: Blinded by the light. (Prue uses her power and moves Gabriel's sword so it cuts him.) You cut me, witch. (He stabs her.) 
 [Cut to Claire's car. Real Prue holds her stomach in pain.] 
 Prue: Aahh! 
 Claire: Prue? 
 [Cut back to pink Prue.] 
 Pink Prue: Prue. (She dies.) 
 Gabriel: Come on. Give it to me. 
 (Helena comes up behind Gabriel.) 
 Miss Statler: Where's her soul. Where's her magic? 
 Gabriel: I've been trapped. She has none. Whoever this is it's not the real witch. 
 [Cut back to the car.] 
 Claire: Are you okay? 
 Real Prue: No, I'm not. 
 Commercial Break 
 
 
 
 [Scene: Coroner's office. Andy is there with the coroner.] 
 Coroner: Autopsy's were scheduled for first thing in the morning but the case officers said you might be able to I.D. the body now. 
 Andy: Homicide victim, right? 
 Coroner: Somebody ran it through as a bladed weapon so I'd call it a big yes. (The coroner gets a body out of the morgue.) No I.D. on the body but those are her personal things. 
 (Andy looks in a plastic bag and sees the tickets to the Bay Area music awards. He looks at the body. It's Pink Prue.) 
 Andy: Prue. 
 [Scene: Manor. Phoebe is practicing her martial arts on the dummy. The doorbell rings. Phoebe answers it. Andy's there. He's been crying.] 
 Phoebe: Hey, Andy. 
 (Andy walks in.) 
 Andy: Phoebe, I'm sorry. 
 Phoebe: What did you do? 
 Andy: This is serious, Phoebe. God, I've done this many times before but this is the worst. Prue's dead. They found her body dumped in the ravine near the precitio. 
 Phoebe: Are you sure that it was Prue? 
 Andy: I saw her body. Investigating officers found a couple of drops of blood on the path to the ravine, blood that probably belonged to the murderer. 
 Phoebe: What was she wearing, Andy? 
 Andy: Excuse me? 
 Phoebe: What colour was she wearing, Andy? 
 Andy: What colour? Phoebe did you just hear what I said? 
 Phoebe: Okay, Andy, now I'm serious. Do you have any idea what colour sweater she was wearing when they found her? I know it sounds strange but it's important. 
 Andy: I think the report said pink. 
 Phoebe: Thank God. 
 Andy: I just told you I saw your sister dead and you're relieved? 
 Phoebe: Andy, it's uh, no secret that we fought at times. 
 Andy: What the hell kind of answer is that, Phoebe? 
 (Piper and blue Prue walk down the hallway.) 
 Piper: (to blue Prue) If you have anymore ideas how to rearrange my business you can save it. Hi Andy. 
 Blue Prue: Andy, nice tie. 
 Andy: I was just at work... (Real Prue enters through the doorway and Piper freezes Andy.) 
 Phoebe: Okay, I may not be an expert, but I think this is the time when somebody hides. 
 Piper: Prue, what's the matter? 
 Real Prue: What is he doing here? 
 Phoebe: He saw you dead at the morgue, obviously a clone and he thought it would be better to break the news here. 
 Real Prue: One of us is dead, I knew it, I felt it happen. 
 Blue Prue: What do you mean? I didn't feel anything. 
 Real Prue: I was in the car with Claire and when she died it felt like it was me. 
 Piper: Uh, okay, but one crisis at a time. Prue you gotta go hide, go, get. 
 (Andy unfreezes.) 
 Andy: And I was in the morgue and you were on a slab. 
 Piper: Andy, you know what they say, everybody has a twin out there somewhere. 
 Andy: Not like this. There has to be a better explanation for what I saw. 
 Phoebe: Okay, well, why do we have to come up with it? 
 Andy: I know what I saw. 
 Blue Prue: Okay, look, Andy, it means the world to me that you came but I'm here and believe me I didn't get killed today. As you can see I'm very much alive. And I'm fine, I promise. 
 Andy: I can't argue with that. By the way, did you make up your mind about the concert? 
 Blue Prue: What concert? 
 Andy: The Bay Area Music Awards. 
 Blue Prue: Oh, you mean the tickets that we ordered months ago. Did those tickets finally come in? 
 Andy: Yeah, they came in the mail. Maybe I'll bring them over sometime. 
 (He leaves. They go in the living room.) 
 Blue Prue: Alright, we need to do something. Gabriel is going to find us and there aren't enough of us left defeat him. 
 Piper: How do you know he's still after you? 
 Real Prue: Because I'm still here. 
 Blue Prue: And as long as I'm needed the spell is still alive. 
 Phoebe: Do you think Gabriel knew he didn't get the real Prue? 
 Blue Prue: I bet on it. We're gonna need more us's to fight him. 
 Piper: More Prue's? 
 Real Prue: Don't worry I'm never casting that spell again, I won't risk anymore me's. 
 Blue Prue: What about our plan? 
 Real Prue: We will still use our powers to sneak into Gabriel's estate. Except we won't be alone when we find him. 
 Blue Prue: Prue, we're geniuses. 
 Phoebe: What are you people thinking? 
 Real Prue: Gabriel Statler is a flesh and blood person with a flesh and blood sister. The only thing that protects him, that makes him invulnerable is that sword. 
 Blue Prue: And Gabriel has this weird binding passion for Helena. So, if we grab her we can use her as leverage. A sword for his sister. 
 Phoebe: That's your plan? 
 Blue Prue: Do you think he won't protect his own flesh and blood? 
 Real Prue: Okay, look, we grab Helena and he either trades his sword for her life or we use her to buy more time until we figure out a way to separate him from his sword. 
 Piper: Okay, so we'll go with you. 
 Real Prue: No way. Today I felt my own death and when that sword went in I felt my life slipping away. I couldn't even imagine something like that happen to either of you. I'm more protective of you guys. 
 [Scene: Statler's estate. Gabriel and Helena are there.] 
 Gabriel: Anything from surveillance? 
 Miss Statler: I saw at least two women identical to Prue Halliwell. One was leaving the restaurant in a blue sweater, the other was entering the manor in a black sweater. We're gonna have to chance it and tackle her at home. Just wait until the hours right before dawn. When they're certain to be asleep and vunerable. 
 Gabriel: (moves a piece on a chess board) Check mate. 
 [Scene: Manor. Phoebe and Piper enter Prue's room. The two Prue's are there.] 
 Piper: Can we have a word with Prue? 
 Both Prue's: Sure. 
 Piper: The real Prue. 
 Real Prue: Yeah, what's up? 
 Piper: Um, in private please. If you don't mind. 
 Phoebe: It's important. Sister stuff. Uh, no offence. 
 Blue Prue: None taken. I'll wait out in the hall. 
 (Blue Prue leaves the room.) 
 Real Prue: I know what you guys are going to say and please don't talk me out of it. 
 Phoebe: Okay, forgive us for not wanting you dead. 
 Real Prue: No, I appreciate that. It's just that we'll be fine. 
 Piper: You don't know that. The warehouse was a trap. How do you know his house isn't just as dangerous? 
 Phoebe: The Statler's don't seem to be the white picket fence type. 
 Real Prue: Well, it's our only option. 
 Piper: No it isn't. Why go to him when you're stronger in your own home with us. 
 Real Prue: And wait for Gabriel to find us? I don't think so. 
 Phoebe: He's a strategist Prue. Every move he has made has been carefully planned, he's studied you. 
 Piper: And if he's learned anything about you it's how protective you are. He knows you'll risk your self in order to save others. Especially your sisters. 
 Phoebe: It's exactly what he wants. You only think you have the upper hand. Okay, just for a moment don't think of us as sister's that you need to protect. 
 Piper: Think of us as sister's that can help you defend. 
 Real Prue: You guys are right. You're right about Gabriel too. It's far too dangerous. Okay, I need to, we need to come up with another plan. So, you guys need to tell the other me. We might be having this conversation all over again. 
 Piper: I'm not talking to that clone. 
 Real Prue: You have to. 
 Phoebe: Did anybody take notes? 
 Piper: I'm not talking to that clone. 
 (They go out to the hallway.) 
 Phoebe: Prue? 
 Piper: She's gone. 
 Real Prue: Gabriel Statler's estate. 
 Phoebe: It's exactly what you would have done isn't it? 
 Real Prue: Yeah, she went to save all of us. Alright, we have to stop her before she does something. 
 [Scene: Statler's estate. Blue Prue has tied Helena up.] 
 Helena: Gabriel. Gabriel. Gabriel! 
 (Gabriel enters the room.) 
 Gabriel: My God, Helena. 
 Helena: She tied me up. 
 (Gabriel pulls out his sword.) 
 Blue Prue: Ah, ah, ah. This in war terms is what I believe they called reversal of fortune. I'll make it easy for you. Your sword for your sister. 
 Gabriel: Done. There's only one problem. You're not the real Prue Halliwell. Any woman smart enough to clone herself would not make the mistake of confronting me here. So tell me, how many of you are there? So, then you're the last clone. Let my sister go, and I'll promise to make it quick and painless for you and the real Prue. 
 Blue Prue: Don't make me do this. Your sword for your sister, please. 
 (Gabriel stabs Helena with his sword.) 
 Gabriel: Who has the reversal of fortune now? 
 [Cut to Piper's car.] 
 Prue: Oohh. (Prue grabs her stomach.) 
 Piper: Are you alright? 
 Phoebe: What's going on? 
 Prue: He's killing her. Oh, God I can feel the sword. I can't breathe. It's over, she's gone. 
 Commercial Break 
 [Scene: Manor. Living room. Prue, Piper and Phoebe are there.] 
 Piper: Okay, now would be a good time for plan B. 
 Phoebe: What about the evidence that Andy talked about? The trail of blood leaving the ravine where they found the first Prue. 
 Piper: We can't assume it's Gabriel's. The book says he's invulnerable. 
 Phoebe: To the weapons of man. That wouldn't include a crystal sword that sucks away your soul. 
 Prue: Right, but I've already proven that you can't take his sword away from him. 
 Phoebe: Why do we have to take it away? Why can't we move Gabriel and his sword even closer? 
 Prue: Pheebs, you are so smart. 
 (She hugs Phoebe and Phoebe has a premonition.) 
 Phoebe: Speaking of getting closer, I think Gabriel's on his way here. 
 [Scene: Coroner's office. Andy's there looking at Pink Prue's body.] 
 Andy: And these fingerprints are cross referenced? 
 Coroner: Okay, I fingerprinted Jane Doe myself and the reference prints you asked for Prudence Halliwell came out of her birth certificate from the archives which I took the liberty of verifying through her DNV records. 
 Andy: And Prue Halliwell's prints are an identical match to Jane Doe's? 
 Coroner: Down to the last whirl. 
 Andy: That's statistically impossible. Not even identical twins have a natural variation. 
 Coroner: Then I'd get on the horn to Ripley's Believe It Or Not because as far as forensic medicine can tell, this woman is Prue Halliwell. 
 Andy: You leave Ripley's out of the loop a long with everyone else who was with me. 
 [Scene: Manor. Prue is waiting for Gabriel. The lights turn off. Prue hears a noise and puts her sunglasses on. A bomb flies through the window and gives off a bright light. Gabriel jumps through the window.] 
 Gabriel: Clever witch. 
 (Prue runs into another room. Gabriel follows her and sees Phoebe's martial arts dummy. He throws his sword at it. Prue, Piper and Phoebe come out from behind the the couch. Piper freezes him.) 
 Piper: Hey, check out G.I. Joe. (Phoebe kicks Gabriel and he flies against the wall.) It worked. 
 (Prue gets the crystal sword out of the dummy.) 
 Gabriel: My weapon. 
 Prue: It's all yours. (She uses her powers and the sword flies into Gabriel. He explodes and disappears. The lights turn back on.) 
 Piper: Peace at last. 
 Prue: Well, too bad you didn't knock him back into the statue. (The doorbell rings) It's his army. Kidding, kidding. (Prue answers the door. Andy's standing there.) Andy, it's four in the morning. 
 Andy: This isn't a social call, Prue. I need you to come with me. 
 Prue: Where to? 
 Andy: City morgue. I'll drive. 
 [Scene: Coroner's office. Andy and Prue walk in.] 
 Prue: Are you gonna tell me what this is all about because you haven't said a word since we got in the car? 
 Andy: I'll show you what this is about. (He pulls out the slab. It's only got clothes on it.) 
 Prue: I don't get it. 
 Andy: I had a body on this slab. She was identical to you right down to your fingerprints. 
 Prue: Andy, I don't know what you want me to say. 
 Andy: You know, ever since you came back into my life it's been one weird coincidence after another. And you don't know what to say. 
 Prue: Why don't you tell me what you want to hear. Andy, I'm sorry but there is nothing but clothes on that slab, so why don't you just take me home. 
 [Scene: Quake. Piper and Phoebe are sitting at a table. Prue comes up and sits down. She's holding a gift basket. Phoebe is reading a newspaper.] 
 Phoebe: "Curiously, the only item found by the slain body of Helena Statler was a blue sweater." 
 Prue: That's a shame because I kinda liked that sweater. 
 Phoebe: What's with the gift basket? 
 Prue: Oh, it's a thank you for my assistant. Believe me, she earned it. 
 Piper: Tumbler number 345, 46 and 47. And that ladies is the end of Quake's yearly inventory. 
 Phoebe: And the end of crowded bathrooms, the end of no hot water and the end of three Prue's hogging all the good clothes. 
 Prue: You know one day you might actually hear what you sound like when you say stuff like that. 
 Phoebe: And I will find myself sassy and delightful. 
 Prue: I won't count on it. Alright, to me, myself and I, and to you guys. I couldn't have done it without you, thank you. 
 Phoebe: And to me for kicking some serious demon butt. 
 Prue: And to clones who vanished without a trace. 
 Piper: Poor Andy, do you think he'll ever figure it out? 
 Prue: I don't know but uh, I wouldn't underestimate him. After what happened this morning we're gonna have to be extra careful. 
 [Scene: Andy's office. He has a folder of Prue's confidential files. He's looking through newspaper clippings and finds one on witchcraft. He then picks up the Bay Area Music Awards tickets and her fingerprints chart. He puts it all back in his draw and sits back in his chair.]
