 Previously on Hannibal 
 You're quite the topic of conversation in the psychiatric circles. 
 The reason you failed to capture the Chesapeake Ripper is I already had him. I did it. 
 Miriam Lass is dead. The Chesapeake Ripper is making it very clear that someone is plagiarizing his work. Is it possible you inadvertently planted the suggestion in Gideon's mind that he was the Ripper? Psychic driving is unethical. 
 I have feelings for you. I can't just have an affair with you. 
 Why? 
 I think you're unstable. 
 You're the subject of a lot of speculation at the Bureau. 
 Jack pushed you right up to the edge and now you're pushing yourself over. 
 (Jack): What happened in there? I saw the look on your face. 
 You must overcome these delusions that are disguising your reality. 
 It's anti-nmda receptor encephalitis. 
 Now that we have confirmed what it is, it'll be easier to hide from him. 
 Someone who already doubts their own identity can be more susceptible to manipulation. 
 Dr. Gideon is a psychopath. 
 Psychopaths are narcissists. They rarely doubt who they are. 
 I tried to appeal to his narcissism. 
 By convincing him he was the Chesapeake Ripper. 
 If only I had been more curious about the common mind. 
 I have no interest in understanding sheep; only eating them. 
 Kudal. A South Indian curry. 
 Made from sheep, of course. 
 In a coconut-coriander- 
 chili sauce. 
 It feels like a last supper. 
 You're not the only psychiatrist accused by a patient of making them kill. 
 Poke around a psychopath's mind, bound to get poked back. 
 What would you do in my position? 
 Deny everything. 
 I thought psychic driving would have been more effective in breaking down his personality. Psychic driving fails because its methods are too obvious. You were trying too hard, Frederick. If force is used, the subject will only surrender temporarily. Once a patient is exposed to the method of manipulation, it becomes much less effective. 
 When Dr. Gideon began to suspect he was being pushed... 
 He pushed back. 
 The subject mustn't be aware of any influence. 
 (Insects chirping) 
 (Breathing rapidly) 
 (Startled shouting) 
 (Catching his breath) 
 So, you get to dress up and I don't? 
 This might affect how well my testimony goes over with the judge. 
 Testimony speaks for itself. 
 Frederick, don't look so worried. 
 I forgive you your trespasses. 
 What trespasses are those? 
 You made me kill the nurse. 
 I take responsibility for killing my wife and her family. 
 The nurse is your fault. 
 I cannot accept responsibility for your actions, Abel. 
 Au contraire. It's why I'm suing you. 
 You made me think I was somebody else, and now... who knows what I'm thinking? 
 Dr. Gideon, you told me you were the Chesapeake Ripper. 
 Dr. Chilton, you told me I was the Chesapeake Ripper, and that's what I'm going to tell everyone. 
 See you in court. 
 You married? 
 You married? 
 You're married. 
 How long you married? 
 That long? 
 Regarding divorce... not that you're getting one; just I can see the clock in your eyes... 
 Word of advice: 
 it's easier just to kill 'em. 
 Kill 'em, kill everyone at the table. 
 Less paperwork. 
 Worked for me. I'm doing ok. 
 Your wife is probably fantastic. 
 My wife? Horrible. 
 So maybe I'm not supposed to be in a relationship. 
 There's people like that. 
 How do you keep those whites so clean? That's... always amazes me.

 Hannibal 01x11 
 Roti 
 Original Air Date June 6, 2013 
 (Heartbeat sounds) 
 All I need is one hand free. 
 (Neck snapping) 
 (Man yelling) 
 (Will breathing rapidly) 
 So, does Abel Gideon still believe that he's the Chesapeake Ripper? 
 Abel Gideon is having a difference of opinion about who he is. 
 The man who escaped from that van was not in the same state of mind when he did this. 
 He took a uniform, police radio, two 9mm handguns, pepper spray, taser, and handcuffs. 
 Well, it's what he didn't take. 
 (Bev): He hung the organs from the branch with vein from the victims. 
 He even tied little bows with some of them. 
 Yeah, it's really impressive. 
 The Chesapeake Ripper would not have left the organs behind. 
 Well, if Gideon isn't the Chesapeake Ripper, he's certainly trying to get his attention. 
 Local PD picked up a foot trail leading out of the woods. Boot soles are consistent with the ones we found at the crime scene. 
 How fresh are the tracks? 
 Two, three hours old. 
 Which direction they headed? 
 Back to Baltimore. 
 (Jack sighs.) 
 (Door opening) 
 I suppose this is my fault too? 
 You did dodge a bullet. 
 Gideon's escape foregoes a trial and a very public humiliation for you. 
 And now you are hosting a private one. 
 Next you'll be accusing me of arranging his escape. 
 No one's making that accusation. 
 If we're tossing around the blame, Dr. Bloom, you're due your fair share. 
 You planted the idea that I was unethically manipulating Gideon. 
 Well, according to Gideon, you were. 
 After you told him I was. 
 You thought I was manipulating him? He was manipulating you. 
 You were pushing him. 
 He gave me informed consent to treat him, said that he was grateful for my help in understanding who he is. 
 What did you help him understand? 
 He was not insane when he killed his wife; killing her drove him insane. 
 I did not convince him that he was a serial killer; I just reminded him of the fact. 
 Gideon is not the Chesapeake Ripper, although he might have thought he was under your care, doctor. 
 Whether he is or he isn't doesn't really matter right now. If he thinks he is or even if he's confused on that issue, he will kill again. 
 I hope he does not, I mean for your sake. Cannot imagine how you would sleep with that on your shoulders. 
 (Chilton's voice distant) During those three minutes, Gideon did horrible things. 
 How did you sleep when Gideon killed your nurse? 
 What does Gideon want? 
 The last thing Abel Gideon said to me is that he intends to tell everyone that he is the Chesapeake Ripper. 
 Our fugitive is Abel Gideon. Transplant surgeon. 
 Convicted in the first degree in the murders of his wife and her family. 
 Institutionalized at the Baltimore State Hospital for the Criminally Insane, where he killed a nurse and claimed to be the Chesapeake Ripper. 
 (Jack's voice becoming distant) 
 Dr. Gideon escaped this morning after killing three people. 
 He is armed and dangerous. He is believed to be... 
 (Jack's voice echoing) 
 In the first degree in the murders of his wife and her family. Institutionalized at the Baltimore State Hospital for the Criminally Insane. 
 Insane. 
 (Jack's voice distant) 
 Escaped this morning. 
 He is armed, he is dangerous... you escaped this morning. 
 He escaped this morning. He is armed and he is extremely dangerous. You escaped this morning. 
 Institutionalized at the Baltimore State... 
 (Cacophony of Jack's voice) 
 What kind of crazy are you?! 
 You kill! You will kill again! 
 (Jack's voice echoing) 
 (Jack speaking indistinctly) 
 (People murmuring quietly) 
 Hannibal: 
 What did you see? 
 A thicket of antlers. 
 All I heard was my heart, dim but... but fast, like, um... footsteps fleeing into silence. 
 I don't know how to gauge who I am anymore. 
 I don't feel like myself. 
 I feel like I have been gradually becoming different for a while. 
 I just feel like somebody else. 
 What do you feel like? 
 I feel crazy. 
 (Will breathing shakily) 
 And that is what you fear most. 
 I fear not knowing who I am. 
 That's what Abel Gideon's afraid of, isn't it? 
 He's like a blind man. 
 Somebody got inside his head and... moved all the furniture around. 
 I imagine Abel Gideon would want to find the Chesapeake Ripper to gauge who he is. 
 And who he isn't. 
 Will. 
 You have me as your gauge. 
 Gideon didn't leave 
 a manifesto. We confiscated all correspondence from his outside admirers. We're going through everything now. 
 Good. 
 Any secret communiqués or coded messages written in bodily fluids or anything else, we'll find them. 
 You won't find anything. 
 Whatever's going on with Gideon, it's in his head. 
 Well, there's not much left in these heads. 
 All organ removal was done postmortem, including the transorbital lobotomies. 
 It wasn't technically a lobotomy. 
 He didn't remove any of the brain; He just scrambled them. 
 Went in through the top of the eye socket... 
 (Jack): Ok, ok. Tell me something. 
 Why remove all of the other organs from the bodies and leave them intact and just scramble the brains? 
 That's what they did to him. 
 What who did to him? 
 Dr. Chilton, every psychiatrist and PhD candidate who attempted any kind of therapy, pushed and prodded, gave him tests, told him who he was, who he wasn't. 
 All right. I want a list of every therapist, every doctor, any kind of psychiatric professional that worked with or talked to Dr. Gideon. 
 Alana Bloom will be on that list. 
 Are you my protective custody? 
 You heard? 
 I heard I get an armed escort until Gideon's apprehended. 
 You'll have a real FBI agent, not a teacher with a temporary badge. 
 Too bad. 
 Would have been fun to cozy up with your dogs in front of a space heater. 
 You don't need protective custody to cozy up with my dogs. 
 Or me, for that matter. 
 Just need a little more, um... stability on my part. 
 You're really warm. 
 Yeah, I tend to run hot. 
 They say stress raises body temperature. 
 Maybe you should take an aspirin. 
 Way ahead of you. 
 They're gonna kill Gideon, aren't they? 
 Whatever happens to him has nothing to do with you. 
 Gideon can't be completely responsible for his actions if he was subjected to an outside influence. 
 What, like Chilton telling him he's the Chesapeake Ripper? 
 Like me telling him he's not in a state of mind to know who he is. 
 Well, he's gonna want somebody to tell him who he is, and I think he'll be looking for the Ripper to do that. 
 What do you think will happen if Gideon finds the Chesapeake Ripper? 
 The Chesapeake Ripper will kill him. 
 He took credit for his work. 
 The Ripper would consider that rude. 
 (Cell phone ringtone) 
 Freddie Lounds. 
 Gideon:  My name is Paul Carruthers. I'm a psychiatrist. 
 I read your article on Abel Gideon. And I yours, Dr. Carruthers. So you're aware of my work? I found your paper on narcissistic personality disorder insightful, especially as it pertains to your opinions of Abel Gideon. Well, thank you. That's very kind of you. You're calling about his escape? Well, yes. I'd like to collaborate On an article for the "Journal of Abnormal Psychology". You want a writing partner? Could we meet? 
 
 Hello? Dr. Carruthers? Ms. Lounds, come on in. Now, you wrote in your tattler archive that the Chesapeake Ripper once removed a man's tongue and used it as a bookmark for his Bible. They call this a Colombian neck tie. What do you think? Ee... Dr. Paul Carruthers wrote an article for the  Journal of Criminal Psychology  in which he described Dr. Gideon as being a pathological narcissist who suffers from psychotic episodes. Let's hope he got some satisfaction from being proved right. I think this is about more than just getting the Chesapeake Ripper's attention. Gideon's mind was dissected by psychiatrists and, as a surgeon, he is applying his own skill set. He gave you something better to do with your tongue than wag it. No, that's not how he died. Drained him till his heart stopped. Got a little on his collar. Other than that, didn't spill a drop. That's because it's all in here. Four-and-a-half liters all packed in ice. "Please deliver to the Red Cross." (Bev): That's considerate. He's peacocking for the Ripper. This is like flowers and chocolate before a first date. How is this news already? Somebody from the Baltimore PD must've taken a picture with their phone and sold it to Tattlecrime. The photo was taken before the blood was put on ice. Dr. Gideon was still here. He has Freddie Lounds. You might be working out the emergency exits, or at least considering them. Let me just tell you there are three. They're all terribly locked down. Now, this relationship between you and me, this can do us both some good. I could write a big story on you, anything you want to say. I did enjoy the article you wrote about that poor nurse who I killed, but it didn't really seem like genuine Freddie Lounds. Jack Crawford told me to write it. Of course he did. To flush out the Chesapeake Ripper. And flushed out he was. That's why he waved Jack Crawford's dead trainee's arm around his head right here like a flag in this very room. Aren't you the Chesapeake Ripper? Miss Lounds, I might be slightly fuzzy in this area, but there's no need to patronize me. I'm sorry. It's like remembering something from your childhood, and you're not sure if it's your memory or a friend's memory, and then you realize sadly it's just some photo in an old book. You're waiting for the Chesapeake Ripper to come back here. Let's hope he gets the invitation. There's one thing we know about your writing: he is an avid fan. Dr. Carson Nahn. He's the psychiatric attending at Western General. He interviewed Dr. Gideon for the same psychopathy survey I participated in two years ago. Total frenectomy, webbing under the tongue; even the connective tissue all the way into the throat is cut free and pulled through for the, uh, desired effect. (Jack sighs.) Still no word from Dr. Chilton? He hasn't answered his phone since yesterday, didn't show up to work today. Gideon wants to lure the Ripper. He's going to offer up the man who disrespected both their identities. Every detail of Dr. Carruthers' murder as described meticulously in Freddie Lounds' article has been faithfully reproduced except... for one. What's different about Carson? Why amputate his arm? (Jack): Did Freddie write anything about this? (Brian): Not that I know of, no. Abel Gideon didn't kill this man; the Chesapeake Ripper did. You said the Chesapeake Ripper would want to kill Gideon for taking credit for his work. Gideon isn't alone anymore, and the Ripper isn't going to risk exposure, so, no, he's... he's, um... He's telling us where to catch him. Actually, he's telling you. Me? Where's the last place you saw a severed arm, Jack? With experience, I have found surgeries are best performed on a local anesthetic or epidural with the patient awake. Reminds me there' a real person here entrusting me with their life rather than a lump of meat that I'm about to reorganize. And in this instance, I would like to see the look on your face. Please... you're not the Chesapeake Ripper. You got inside my mind, Frederick. It's only fair I get inside your belly. This is of course Freddie Lounds, who you know. She will be assisting me today... or assisting you... by manually pumping the ventilator should you stop breathing. Oh, my God. The real Chesapeake Ripper is a collector of surgical trophies. I'm gonna leave him a little gift. In fact, I'm gonna leave him a gift basket. You know, it is truly amazing how many organs the body can offer up before it really begins to suffer. All right, stay awake now! Come on, Frederick. I'm gonna ask you to hold a few things. Hmm. What next? (Jack): I want you to wait outside. That's probably best. You look like hell, Will. I feel like hell. Actually, no, I feel... Uh, fluid, like I'm spilling. Must have come down with something. I hope it's not contagious. (Jack's voice distant) This work that we do... (Jack's voice normal) ...It will compromise your immune system, if you allow it. You've got to keep things in perspective. You've got to keep yourself in perspective. Well, myself is a little hazy at the moment. You've gotta start taking better care of yourself. Build my resistance? You just can't take it all in. You've got to let go of as much of it as you can. You just gotta let go. You know, it's hard to shake off something that's already under your skin. Mark. Go! Clear. Clear. No sign of Gideon. Gideon's gone. He's still alive. I need medical in here now! I was expecting the Chesapeake Ripper. Or are you he? Turn around. Don't look at me. You are looking a little peaky, Mr. Graham, if you don't mind my saying. I may be crazy, but you look ill. Drive. Who is your doctor? I'm having a hard time thinking. (Will panting) I feel like I'm losing my mind. I-I don't know what's real. It's 7:27 pm. You're in Baltimore, Maryland, and your name is Will Graham. No I don't care who I am! Just tell me... if he's real. Who do you see, Will? Garret Jacob Hobbs. Who do you see? I don't see anyone. No, he's right there. There's no one there, Will. No, no, you're lying. We're alone. You came here alone. Do you remember coming here? No, please don't lie to me! Garret Jacob Hobbs is dead. You killed him. You watched him die. What's happening to me? Will, Will, Will, you're having an episode. I want you to hand me over the gun. Will, I want you to hand me your... Will? Will. He's had a mild seizure. That doesn't seem to bother you. I said it was mild. Are you the man who claimed to be the Chesapeake Ripper? Why do you say "claimed"? Because you're not. You know you're not, and you don't know much more about who you are beyond that. Are you the Ripper? A terrible thing... to have your identity taken from you. Well, I'm taking it back, one piece at a time. You should see the pieces I got out of my psychiatrist. Alana Bloom was one of your psychiatrists too. Is that right? Yes. Dr. Bloom. I can tell you where to find her. (Hannibal): Will can you hear me? (Hannibal): Repeat after me. (Hannibal): My name is Will Graham. My name is Will Graham. Raise both of your arms. More. More. Good. Although you may not feel like it, I need you to smile. Good. It wasn't a stroke. You may have had a seizure. Tell me the last thing you remember. I... (Will panting) I was with Garret Jacob Hobbs. You have a fever. You were hallucinating. You thought he was alive, here in the room with you. I saw him. He's a delusion disguising reality. Don't let that let you slip away. You killed Garret Jacob Hobbs once. You can find a way to kill him again. Where are you going? Abel Gideon is still at large. He mutilated Dr. Chilton. They found him clinging to life. I'm worried about Alana. Alana. No, no, no, no, no, no. Will. You're in no state to go anywhere but the hospital. I'll call Jack and tell him where you are. I have to make a phone call. Can I ask you to step out? I don't know if I will ever be myself again. I don't know if I've got any "self" left over. I spent so long thinking I was him, it's gotten really hard to remember who I was when I wasn't him. Who are you now? Now I'm you. We're both here, looking at her, just those kind of people that shouldn't be in a relationship. You and I are already committed. It's hard to be with another person when you... can't get out of your own head. I want to get out. Yeah, well, we all want things that we can't have. But if I kill her like he would kill her, then maybe I could understand him better. I wonder if then you would finally understand what you've become. (Gunshot) They will be sewing up Dr. Chilton until the morning... That is, if he makes it through the night. At least Will remains in one piece... for now. His temperature is 105. White blood cell count is twice normal, and they still can't identify the source of his infection. They will. You seem confident. I am. Even with a temperature of 105 degrees, Will was able to bring Gideon down. I told you, he'll be fine. Jack... I would recommend you suspend his license to carry firearms. You and I are just gonna have to have a difference of opinion about who Will is, doctor. I know who Will is. Will knows who he is. Yes. But our experiences shape us, Jack. How is this experience going to shape Will? (Monitor beeping) (Ventilator pumping) (Birds singing) Will Graham is troubled. And that troubles you? Beyond a professional concern for a patient? I see his madness and I want to contain it, like an oil spill. Oil is valuable. What value does Will Graham's madness have for you? You're suggesting I'm more fascinated with the madness than the man? Are you? No. He realized early on that he saw things differently than other people, felt things differently. So did you. I see myself in Will. Do you see yourself in his madness? Madness can be a medicine for the modern world. You take it in moderation, it's beneficial. You overdose and it can have unfortunate side effects. Side effects can be temporary. They can be a boost to our psychological immune systems to help fight the existential crises of normal life. Will Graham does not present you with problems from normal life. No. He doesn't. What does he present you with? The opportunity for friendship. He is still your patient, Hannibal. Where Will Graham is concerned, if you feel the impulse to step forward, you must force yourself to take a step back. And just watch him lose his mind? Sometimes all we can do is watch.
