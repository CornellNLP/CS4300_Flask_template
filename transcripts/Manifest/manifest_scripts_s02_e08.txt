 Previously on "Manifest" So, your mom was Buddhist? 
  When I came back and she was gone, I had my own mini ­Buddhist memorial rite for her. 
  I want you to have this. 
  I have something for you, too. 
  Professor Stone. 
  Simon White. 
  - We're delighted you're considering us. 
  - I'm glad to be here. 
  I'll get you all the information you need today. 
  Good, 'cause it's all coming together on our end. 
  If there's a chance to cure the Death Date, - I have to figure it out. 
  - Been hoping you'd reach out. 
  No, I wouldn't have bothered you. 
  I just hit a wall. 
  - Can I at least say I'm sorry? 
  - I loved you. 
  I think I did it. 
  DNA has no anomaly. 
  What the hell is with all these passengers? 
  It's a trap. 
  He lured us here! 
  Ben! 
  We will all be miracles and transcend death just like you did. 
  Get her out! 
  Go! 
  I'm coming back! 
  TJ found a journal. 
  He thinks it's about the Death Date. 
  TJ! 
  Aah! 
  TJ! 
  Detective Stone. 
  We found another body. 
  Nice and easy. 
  Watch your back. 
  Up and over. 
  Here we go. 
  Male. 
  Pretty tall. 
  Six lives total so far. 
  We're working closely with FDNY to gather more information. 
  And, yes, we are very much treating this fire as a crime. 
  Is it true that the passengers of Flight 828 were the intended targets? 
  That's our best guess so far. 
  Although a number of the fatalities and injuries - have been non-passengers. 
  - So, who torched the place? 
  Detective Stone's firsthand account indicates this might have been arson committed by a disgruntled member of the Church of the Believers. 
  Isaiah McCann. 
  This has those Xer sons of bitches written all over it. 
  Maybe these two are working with them. 
  - I don't think so. 
  - You seem awfully certain. 
  - The investigation is ongoing. 
  - You know something we don't? 
  So keep this information under wraps until further notice. 
  Suspected arson is at play. 
  As you can see behind me, - the community has rallied together, - bringing flowers, cards, candles Sweet of you to stop by, Simon. 
  It's the least I could do. 
  I'm sorry. 
  The phone calls, news coverage, it's nonstop. 
  Excuse me. 
  Hello? 
  We took Cal to my dad's. 
  It's just too much for him. 
  Any of us, really. 
  And as for Olive, well, it's I know TJ was a friend to all of you. 
  Everyone on campus is terribly upset. 
  Upset?! 
  That is such bull! 
  - Olive! 
  - No, I'm sorry. 
  Everyone at that campus thought TJ was a freak. 
  Nobody accepted him. 
  Nobody even knew anything about him. 
  And now they're all sad that he's gone. 
  I'm sorry. 
  Excuse me. 
  I-I-I'll just get out of your hair. 
  Just gonna use the bathroom. 
  Yeah, it's through the door on the right. 
  A woman from the Bronx has found her sister - Do you really need to be watching this? 
  - last seen at the nightclub, being treated at Ed Koch Hospital. 
  It's just search-and-rescue still going on. 
  Alright, that woman just found her sister. 
  I mean, TJ could have made it out alive, too. 
  Recently, the National Fire Protection Agency has enacted tough new code provisions for fire sprinklers Will you please try? 
  For me? 
  I'm not hungry. 
  Olive, you need to eat. 
  I'll make you something else. 
  Whatever you want. 
  Hey. 
  Simon, this is my sister, Michaela. 
  Mick, this is my colleague, Simon. 
  Nice to meet you. 
  You need anything, don't hesitate. 
  - I mean it. 
  - I appreciate that. 
  Um, can I talk to you in the other room? 
  Wait. 
  Did you find TJ? 
  Uh, Olive, let me talk to Aunt Mick. 
  No. 
  I have the right to know. 
  Please. 
  Tell me. 
  Olive, um No. 
  No. 
  I'm sorry. 
  No, no, no, no. 
  No, no, no. 
  No, no, no! 
  It's okay. 
  It's okay. 
  Look, our mission with Humanity First is simple to create a greater, safer, stronger nation for us and our children. 
  The passengers of Flight 828 threaten that mission. 
  They've robbed banks. 
  They've been accused of murder. 
  And rumors of their inhuman abilities run rampant. 
  Let us be clear. 
  These are 185 walking time bombs working in our hospitals, our universities, our police precincts. 
  Which one of them will be next to detonate? 
  We gotta get these bastards before they get us. 
  - Be in touch. 
  - Very good. 
  I appreciate you attending. 
  I appreciate you asking. 
  Listen, just a heads up. 
  I wouldn't be surprised if people in your orbit start to get interrogated about that club fire the other night. 
  I'm on the verge of exposing the 828ers for the threat they are. 
  Violence would make them sympathetic. 
  Why would I do that? 
  I'm not saying you would. 
  My sources tell me it was a rogue member of the Church of the Believers. 
  Their leader disappeared, too. 
  Probably in hiding. 
  This is good. 
  We could use this. 
  False flag operation set by 828 sympathizers to generate support. 
  Thank you. 
  You've proven quite valuable. 
  Happy to help. 
  Jared, uh, one favor to ask. 
  A-A movement like ours needs all types, but we've got some impulsive members. 
  Your pal Billy for one. 
  He's quite effective at bringing new people to the movement, but he tends to act without thinking. 
  - Hmm. 
  - Which could be detrimental to our goals. 
  Please keep an eye on him. 
  Yeah, if we could get a bed, please. 
  You need a bed? 
  Saanvi. 
  Hey. 
  Saanvi. 
  - Saanvi. 
  - Yeah? 
  - You okay? 
  - Yeah. 
  I've just been here all night. 
  What's up? 
  The last thing I want to do is take you away from an emergency. 
  There's no one else to save. 
  They suspended the search-and-rescue. 
  It's just search-and-recovery now. 
  What? 
  Could I show you something? 
  If you could just take a seat, please Are you in any pain? 
  Nothing I can't handle. 
  But it's not getting better. 
  It's just like in the cave. 
  I think you might be right. 
  I may be freezing to death. 
  Can you help me? 
  We need to get you to my lab right now. 
  Let's go. 
  Sorry, Jared did what? 
  Defended the Xers. 
  At least that's what it sounded like to me. 
  He was insistent that they couldn't be involved in the arson. 
  - What? 
  - I mean, the Xers didn't start the fire, but - But ? 
  - I don't know. 
  I My gut is telling me that Jared's involved in something that could cause some serious problems. 
  You think he's in with the Xers? 
  Do you? 
  I hate to say it, but, yeah, I do. 
  I-I think he's leaking police intel to them. 
  He copied my investigations and then he lied about it. 
  - Are you kidding me right now? 
  - That's all I have on him, so I can't Let's tail him. 
  I'm not there yet. 
  Do you want answers or not? 
  She seems okay, but I don't know. 
  My laying into her about Adrian and following the Believers, I just created this giant void between us. 
  But you were right, Ben. 
  Everything you said to her. 
  Yeah, but it doesn't make it any better. 
  I told myself I was gonna make up for lost time, but I just pushed her further and further away from me since I came back, Grace. 
  I don't know what to do. 
  I think we need to give her space. 
  And who knows? 
  Maybe the time will be good for both of you. 
  What do you mean? 
  Ben, when you came back and learned that your mother had died, you were so focused on helping all of us that I don't think you ever really processed that loss. 
  This is about Olive. 
  And she just lost the first love of her life. 
  I have to do something to help her. 
  You can't protect her from her pain. 
  I just can't stop thinking about that Al-Zuras illustration of the man carrying the girl through the fire. 
  It might as well have been a picture of me and Olive at the nightclub. 
  I know. 
  It gives me the chills. 
  It means something. 
  It has to. 
  What the hell do you want from me? 
  Mick. 
  Did you just get that Calling? 
  No. 
  Why? 
  What was it? 
  Some sort of chanting, but not in a language I recognized. 
  I wish I could help. 
  The last Calling I had was about fire. 
  I didn't figure it out until it was too late. 
  People died. 
  I can't let that happen again. 
  Okay, well, a lot more people survived because of you, too. 
  Look, hang in there, okay? 
  I'll I'll call you if I hear anything. 
  Alright. 
  Okay, your MRI looks good. 
  There's no bone or muscle damage. 
  I want to check your blood-cell count and filtration, okay? 
  This is all just a band-aid. 
  It's not gonna save my life. 
  - No. 
  - So what will? 
  Saanvi, I've got six months. 
  Please. 
  I've been doing some experiments on myself. 
  I've been able to eliminate the DNA anomaly from my body with an injectable serum. 
  And the Callings? 
  They're gone. 
  So, what are we waiting for? 
  It's still preliminary, Zeke. 
  I don't know how long it's gonna last or if it's even safe. 
  There could be side effects, and it could backfire. 
  - It could make me worse. 
  - Worse than dying? 
  Look, Michaela and I She makes me feel like my life is finally coming together. 
  And to lose it all because of this Death Date I'm a sap. 
  Listen, when you care for someone that deeply, I get wanting to hold onto it, no matter what. 
  Been there, done that? 
  I wish I was still there. 
  But I lost it. 
  Saanvi, I don't have any more time to waste. 
  Okay. 
  First, you need to clear the pre-clinical testing kidney function, liver enzymes, tox screens. 
  That's just to name a few. 
  If you pass that, and assuming your system doesn't reject the infusion, then, yes, you might have a chance of actually beating this. 
  Just say when. 
  When. 
  It's all my fault. 
  I made TJ go to the nightclub. 
  He didn't even want to be there. 
  This was not your fault, Olive. 
  It was a horrible tragedy at the hands of someone who was seriously disturbed. 
  Olive. 
  This drawing Every time I see it, I see you and me. 
  I just had a Calling when I was looking at it in the garage. 
  What did the Calling say? 
  I don't know. 
  It was some sort of chanting. 
  But I think it has something to do with you and me. 
  I'm not a part of the Callings. 
  I think now you are. 
  I think we're supposed to do something together. 
  Well, it's a little late now, isn't it? 
  If some random, old drawing suddenly makes me a part of the Callings, then why didn't the drawings show you carrying me and TJ out of the fire? 
  Why didn't the Callings stop this? 
  The Callings didn't do this to TJ, Olive. 
  Well, it sure didn't save him, either. 
  Look, Ol, there's a memorial site set up at the nightclub. 
  I could take you. 
  We could both pay our respects together. 
  I can't. 
  Okay? 
  I am not ready. 
  Alright. 
  You go. 
  Where's your brother? 
  Hey, babe. 
  Missed you, too. 
  - You good? 
  - Mm-hmm. 
  Hey, Vasquez, you want a drink? 
  We're just, uh, celebrating a few less 828ers in the world today. 
  Can we talk? 
  Yeah, okay. 
  So, I just spoke with Simon. 
  He doesn't want anyone going off the rails over this. 
  He's got a solid plan, Billy. 
  He just He wants us to stay on course. 
  You and Simon are having private pow-wows now? 
  I-I was the one who brought you in on this. 
  He knows how invaluable you are to the cause. 
  He just He just wants us to stay chill right now. 
  You're getting pretty cozy pretty fast there, Vasquez. 
  Moving in on my sister, up Simon's ass Hey! 
  Watch it. 
  That mouth of yours is gonna get you in some serious trouble - one of these days. 
  - With who? 
  you? 
  I'll take you. 
  Alright, Billy. 
  Just stop it. 
  Jared. 
  I swear Billy was dropped on his head as a baby. 
  It's the only way to explain how we're related. 
  You got to watch out. 
  The kid can go pretty psycho. 
  So can I. 
  This isn't exactly how I pictured spending my Thursday afternoon. 
  Yeah, I wouldn't want to watch my ex kissing someone else, either. 
  Yeah, I don't love seeing Jared making out with another woman, but that's not all that's bugging me. 
  What? 
  This bar It's not his vibe. 
  At least it didn't used to be. 
  No, him him being here, it just feels wrong. 
  There's something going on in there. 
  - I'm gonna go in. 
  - No. 
  Whoa. 
  I'm getting a major "passengers not allowed" vibe from this place. 
  You're the last person who could walk in here incognito. 
  Okay, fine. 
  You want to go in? 
  I thought you'd never ask. 
  Get your Annie Leibovitz on. 
  This is all me. 
  Okay. 
  I'll bite. 
  Hey. 
  Uh, IPA. 
  Something local? 
  Gotcha. 
  - Nice suit. 
  - Yeah. 
  Thanks. 
  Almost makes up for constantly living out of a suitcase and dealing with flight delays. 
  Mm. 
  LaGuardia? 
  The worst. 
  I was gonna bide my time rolling e-mails, but then I saw this cool chick kissing Prince Charming outside a bar and figured, "Maybe my future husband's laying in wait". 
  Sorry to report my boyfriend isn't exactly your typical customer in here. 
  Afraid you're stuck with my brother and his bonehead friends. 
  Beats the Delta lounge. 
  Hey. 
  Who wants to lose 20 bucks? 
  I think you mean who wants to win $50? 
  Rack 'em. 
  Excuse me. 
  Do you hear anything? 
  Just the heater. 
  It's always clicking like that. 
  You always make profits on, your, uh, stakeouts? 
  I won this money fair and square. 
  Not even gonna ask. 
  So, Jared's new flame's the bartender. 
  She may be an Xer because her brother and the jackasses he hangs out with sure as hell are. 
  Jared seems to be close with all of them, but especially the brother, Billy. 
  Why, Jared? 
  I don't know. 
  But let's run those pics through the database, see if we can make a case out of any of them. 
  Anything else? 
  You're not gonna want to hear this, but the bartender smells good. 
  I'm getting a new partner. 
  I'm sorry. 
  You love me. 
  No, I don't. 
  My heart. 
  It just feels like someone's punching it out. 
  None of this makes sense. 
  It just I don't know how to make it stop. 
  I think I might. 
  I think the Calling wants to help us heal. 
  No, Dad, I already No, no, no, no. 
  Just listen. 
  I had the chanting Calling again, and it led me from the memorial site to this Zen Center. 
  Wait. 
  You went to a Zen Center? 
  - Like, for Buddhists? 
  - Exactly. 
  The place was empty, but the chanting it was I don't know how to put it. 
  Enveloping me. 
  TJ's mom was a Buddhist. 
  The bracelet he gave you. 
  When he came back and he learned she was gone, he did his own DIY Buddhist ceremony for her, to say goodbye. 
  Maybe we're supposed to do that for TJ. 
  You know, to have some sort of spiritual closure. 
  It's just like the Al-Zuras drawing. 
  You carried her through the flames. 
  Maybe the Calling wants you to carry her through her grief? 
  Carry each other. 
  What do you think? 
  I couldn't care less what the Callings want. 
  But TJ He would have really liked that. 
  Hey. 
  Do you still hear it? 
  The chanting? 
  TJ used beads like those when he did the ceremony for his mom. 
  Well, good. 
  I'll follow your lead. 
  I don't know what to do. 
  I don't know the right mantra. 
  We can make up our own. 
  You and me. 
  DIY, right? 
  Come on. 
  Exactly how many beers did you consume on that mission? 
  Exactly one. 
 
 
 
  Might just want to pop a little breath mint. 
  We have a hit. 
  Oh, hello, dirt bag. 
  Stints for assault, drunk and disorderly And, wait for it, a recent charge for vandalism. 
  Arrest report notes anti-828 graffiti. 
  Jared's bestie is officially a criminal and an Xer. 
  He really is one of them. 
  Jared? 
  Are you surprised? 
  I mean, now the haircut makes sense. 
  Hey, you okay? 
  No, not really. 
  I-I can't help but feel like I did this to him. 
  What, made Jared a bigoted hate-monger? 
  No. 
  He did that all by himself. 
  This isn't the guy that I was gonna marry. 
  Something's wrong here. 
  Something seems not right here. 
  People change. 
  But are you with me on this? 
  Now what? 
  Just knowing they're in a hate group doesn't give us cause to move. 
  Not yet. 
  But the Xers are gonna do something. 
  Jared stole my case files, and that can unravel a lot of lives. 
  So, how are we gonna figure it out, Supercop? 
  This is Detective Stone for Judge Trilling. 
  The judge who released Zeke? 
  Your Honor, I Yeah, hi. 
  It's me. 
  Judge, I need a favor. 
  Now what? 
  Well, how about we think of each bead as a memory of TJ? 
  And we can share it with each other and with him? 
  Out loud? 
  Too hokey? 
  No. 
  When I first saw you in my dad's office, I could I could barely breathe. 
  I was too embarrassed to admit that I remembered you from Jamaica and that I had the biggest crush on you ever since. 
  Your kindness and your sweet smile and your heart, it it stayed with me for 5 and a half years. 
  First day of school, my tryout, you not only came to support me, but you gave me that lifeline in class. 
  That was That was really cool. 
  All of a sudden, you weren't a student or just an 828 passenger. 
  You were my friend. 
  You always talked about how your mom taught you to stay true to yourself and follow the path of enlightenment. 
  I hope you found your path, TJ. 
  I'll keep looking for mine. 
  Wow. 
  Good. 
  Well, you know who I am. 
  I know who you are, so that saves us the introductions. 
  You've either got big brass ones or you've just wandered into the last place - you want to wander into. 
  - I'm gonna go with that first option, seeing as I definitely meant to show up here. 
  I actually came to talk to you. 
  If the idea is to talk me out of seeing Jared, I'll tell you right now you're wasting your time. 
  No, I actually came to help Jared. 
  Maybe help you, too. 
  Who says we need help? 
  Well, I know that Jared is a part of an anti-828 group, and I know that your brother is, too. 
  You got issues with Jared or Billy, - you should be talking to them. 
  - NYPD will be. 
  Soon. 
  That nightclub fire triggered a zero-tolerance policy on anti-828 violence. 
  I know there's more coming and that Jared is a part of it, so that gives me two choices. 
  Either you're a part of this group and you get busted along with him or you're actually a good person who's just in way over their head. 
  And if you care about Jared, then you'll help extricate him from this mess. 
  Look, I know your brother He's a lost cause, but Jared's not. 
  Maybe you think you still know who Jared is. 
  But you don't. 
  Yeah. 
  Maybe you're right. 
  You need to get back here. 
  Thank you. 
  You don't have to thank me for anything. 
  This was for the both of us. 
  Even after how hard I've been, you've never stopped looking out for me. 
  And I never will. 
  You hear it again? 
  Did we not do what it wanted? 
  Maybe not. 
  Maybe there's more. 
  Where is it coming from? 
  I don't know. 
  Everywhere. 
  Are you sure? 
  Maybe it wants you to follow it. 
  I followed it here. 
  Right, but maybe this isn't the final destination. 
  Concentrate. 
  Come on. 
  - Stay here. 
  - What? 
  No way! 
  Anything? 
  The chanting. 
  It's louder. 
  What? 
  Is it on the other side? 
  Yeah, I think it is. 
  Aren't we underground? 
  I know. 
  I don't get it. 
  Over here! 
  There's a door! 
  What is it? 
  I don't know. 
  But it's louder now. 
  - Hello? 
  - Shh. 
  Shh. 
  Shh. 
  Is somebody down there? 
  Hey. 
  I think we have to do this together. 
  Let's do it. 
  What is this? 
  Some kind of subway track? 
  Ah, too narrow. 
  Maybe part of an old coal transport or some sort of prohibition smugglers' tunnel. 
  You still hear it? 
  Yeah, so much so my eardrums might explode. 
  I understand chanting in a Zen Center, but down here? 
  Why? 
  I don't know. 
  Your guess is as good as mine. 
  This way. 
  What the hell? 
  Hey. 
  You want to go back? 
  Hell, no. 
  I told you he was gonna be trouble. 
  Forget Jared. 
  He and I have our own thing. 
  It's his ex who's your problem. 
  My problem? 
  It's his problem. 
  Vasquez better shut that 828 freak up, or he's the one who goes down. 
  They go on and on, but there's your proof. 
  Definitely incriminating. 
  None of it's admissible. 
  I don't have to tell you that an illegal tap is a felony. 
  Surveillance warrant, courtesy of Judge Trilling. 
  We've got Vasquez, captain. 
  He's the leak who blew the Xer bust. 
  And he copied Stone's files and gave them to God knows who. 
  This is a serious accusation. 
  I know you think it's always too personal between me and Vasquez, but that's the problem he made it personal. 
  I'll take it from here. 
  There's stuff in the air. 
  I can feel it in my throat. 
  It's ash. 
  The nightclub's just a few blocks away. 
  I bet this path is leading right towards it. 
  The chanting, it's just Wait, wait, wait, wait. 
  It went away. 
  Are you sure? 
  No, I'm positive. 
  It Just all of a sudden, it just Hello? 
  Help. 
  Anybody? 
  Anybody, please. 
  - TJ! 
  - Olive! 
  Here! 
  I'm here! 
  Olive! 
  TJ! 
  TJ! 
  - TJ! 
  - TJ! 
  TJ! 
  Help, please! 
  TJ! 
  TJ! 
  - Olive? 
  - TJ! 
  Olive, I'm here! 
  Oh, my God. 
  You're alive. 
  Take it Take it easy. 
  How is this happening? 
  We're gonna get you out of here. 
  Six broken ribs. 
  His punctured lung created severe internal bleeding, plus extreme dehydration. 
  I doubt he would have made it another few hours. 
  It's a miracle, really. 
  He's a lucky young man. 
  Thank you. 
  We should call mom. 
  We should call everyone. 
  I don't get it. 
  How? 
  Aunt Mick found my bracelet. 
  I have absolutely no idea. 
  Isaiah. 
  Shh. 
  Shh. 
  You need to get rest. 
  I pulled away from him, and he was holding onto the bracelet. 
  Isaiah. 
  It was Isaiah's body that they found. 
  TJ, how did you find your way underneath that building, with all that smoke? 
  I-I couldn't see a thing. 
  I heard voices. 
  Chanting. 
  You found your path to enlightenment. 
  Wow. 
  Good news travels seriously fast. 
  - I heard it over the scanner. 
  How? 
  - How do you think? 
  That's one hell of a Calling. 
  It's a really long story. 
  Mom was right. 
  All things do work together for good. 
  TJ surviving, us following the Callings, it's it's teaching us something. 
  When you figure out what that is, why don't you send me the Cliff Notes? 
  My problem? 
  It's his problem. 
  Vasquez better shut that 828 freak up, or he's the one who goes down. 
  We've got a problem. 
  Hey. 
  What are you doing here? 
  I haven't been able to concentrate all day. 
  That was a mistake. 
  It was lovely. 
  But, Saanvi, I've made my choice, and it's my family, my husband. 
  You and I we can never do that again. 
  Do what again?

  I don't remember where I was this morning. 
  I don't I don't remember a thing.

  - Hey. 
  You okay? 
  Yeah. 
  No. 
  Not really. 
  What's up? 
  Jared betrayed me in a way that I can't even describe. 
  There's no way to justify what he's done, but why do I feel like I deserve it?

  I'm so glad I have you and that we can trust each other. 
  Me, too. 
  Michaela, I gotta What? 
  Zeke, what is this? 
  Frost bite. 
  It's happening. 
  No. 
  No, no, no. 
  I can't lose you. 
  I can't. 
  Saanvi thinks she can help. 
  She may have a cure. 
  I'm not giving up without a fight.
