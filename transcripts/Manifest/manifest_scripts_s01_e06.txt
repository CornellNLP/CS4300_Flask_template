 Previously on "Manifest" There's a new treatment protocol for pediatric cases within Cal's profile. 
  The odds are excellent. 
  Cal's treatment came from work I was doing before the plane disappeared. 
  Set them free! 
  Set them free. 
  I think it sounds like you're losing your mind. 
  I know you like Italian. 
  We just never seemed to make it to dessert. 
  Save him! 
  We need to save him. 
  This is NYPD. 
  We're going in. 
  Down on the floor! 
  The whole operation is botched. 
  I know there's more to the story here, just like I know there's more to the story about those kidnapped girls. 
  I knew someone must have saved my ass. 
  You'll tell me what she does, who she talks to all of it. 
  It's all connected. 
  Ladies and gentlemen, if you need any assistance filling out your customs and immigration forms, please ring your flight attendant call button. 
  Hey. 
  Sorry, I only speak English. 
  Cal? 
  Get the thermometer. 
  He's burning up. 
  It's okay, pal. 
  Dad's here, Dad's here. 
  Shh! 
  They're hurting me! 
  Help. 
  Hey, what's going on? 
  It's just a bad dream, buddy. 
  No, no, no! 
  Not the red door! 
  - Let me see, let me see. 
  Shh, shh. 
  - No, no, no! 
  Not the red door! 
  103. 2. 
  We should get him to a hospital. 
  Get Olive. 
  No, she slept at Avery's. 
  Gonna be okay, buddy. 
  Gonna be okay. 
  Sure, scientifically, the potential for a highly localized discontinuity in space could lead to teleportation, but you have to understand, the structure of that airplane would've had to withstand extreme forces far in excess of what it was designed to withst So you're saying it wasn't a wormhole? 
  I'm not in the business of saying what things aren't. 
  I'm just saying there are other possibilities. 
  Of course it's a wormhole. 
  We have to consider that the laws of physics as we know them may not apply. 
  Let's talk about that. 
  Finest minds in the scientific community, and they can't even come to a consensus on the ground rules. 
  Sixth panel we've held on this. 
  Pretty much par for the course. 
  Did you see the report from DARPA? 
  The one they tried to bury in 1,000 pages of inconclusive test results? 
  Bureaucratic oversight my ass. 
  Can always count on DoD for some counterproductive territorialism. 
  Tell the directors I want to see the reports the day they're published, not buried in some document dump. 
  Supposed to be a joint investigation, not some inter-agency sack race. 
  Along those lines, sir, should I make the other agencies aware we're developing a man on the inside. 
  No, no, not yet. 
  Let's see how useful Detective Vasquez proves to be first. 
  You really think he's gonna be straight with us? 
  They used to be engaged. 
  I expect he's gonna lie his ass off, and when he does, we've got enough dirt on him to make his life very difficult. 
  A personal day? 
  Are you kidding me? 
  Captain's gonna flip. 
  We're already shorthanded as it is. 
  Something happened to Cal. 
  He's in the hospital. 
  I'm sorry, Mick. 
  I thought this was one of you know, one of those things you're not explaining to me. 
  No, it's not. 
  I got you. 
  Don't worry about Riojas. 
  So, where are we? 
  As you know, because of Cal's cancer treatment, his immune system isn't as strong as it normally would be. 
  We've given him acetaminophen to try to knock his temperature down. 
  My primary concern is that we haven't been able to identify what's causing his fever. 
  Until we do that, we can only really treat his symptoms. 
  But there are tests we can run to find out, right? 
  Given Cal's medical history. 
  Yeah, Dr. 
  Williams has ordered a full series of labs. 
  In the meantime, I suggest you get some rest. 
  Uh Dr. 
  Williams. 
  I'm sorry, I didn't want to say anything in front of Saanvi, but is it possible that her experimental treatment is what's making Cal sick? 
  Grace, we've been through a lot. 
  You know as well as I do that that treatment has been a miracle. 
  Well, how much do we actually know? 
  It's only been two weeks. 
  The program administrator said they haven't seen anything like this in the other patients. 
  Grace, breathe. 
  We went down this road five years ago. 
  Wait for the tests. 
  Let's take this one step at a time and not get ahead of ourselves. 
  You're gonna be okay, buddy. 
  I remember when Cal first got sick. 
  I knew something was wrong, and The waiting to find out what it was. 
  I thought I could never feel that helpless again, but now I know it's not much comfort, but the odds are just so much better now. 
  Hey. 
  I'm monitoring dozens of cases, and we are seeing really great results. 
  I'm sorry. 
  You're dedicating your life to this, and I'm sitting here using you as a therapist. 
  You're not even on the clock. 
  You should go home, enjoy your life. 
  Oh, my work is my life. 
  I live with my parents. 
  I mean, I used to have my own place, but now I don't think they'll ever let me move out. 
  I mean, not that it matters. 
  The hours that I work, I can barely keep a house plant alive. 
  It's okay, buddy. 
  What's he saying? 
  Just mumbling in his sleep. 
  No, I've heard that before. 
  That's not English. 
  What? 
  What language is it? 
  I don't know, but I've I've heard it. 
  Not just that language those exact words. 
  It's from the plane. 
  Help! 
  Yeah, I mean, of course it's a calling. 
  Cal doesn't speak other languages. 
  I don't know. 
  Maybe he heard the same person I did on the plane. 
  What, he's now having nightmares in that same language? 
  No, this is this is not a coincidence. 
  It's not a virus. 
  We've had shared thoughts before, but Cal's illness, he's just not as strong as the other passengers. 
  This calling is connected to what's making him sick. 
  Okay, who was this person that was speaking another language on the plane? 
  He was just a guy who needed help filling out his customs form. 
  - What did he look like? 
  - I don't know. 
  Wait, I may have a picture. 
  Average build, dark hair, he sat one or two rows ahead of me. 
  Any of these familiar? 
  That's my bro. 
  "Beautiful Mind," travel edition. 
  Wow, you collected all this? 
  Oh, here. 
  7-F. 
  I-I recognize him from the hangar. 
  Um, he's Eastern European or something? 
  Bulgarian. 
  Marko Valeriev. 
  Ah, damn it, he's one of the people I haven't been able to track down. 
  Wait, seriously? 
  This is the most watched group of people on the planet. 
  - You can't find anything on him? 
  - I know. 
  It seems odd, but there are a handful of people I haven't been able to place, mostly foreign nationals or people who presumably went into hiding after Kelly's murder. 
  - Can you blame them? 
  - Still, this is the one person who can help us shed light on Cal's illness, and we can't find him. 
  You got to be able to remember something else about him. 
  Did he say anything? 
  Okay, there was a woman behind me, helped him fill out his customs form. 
  She was an older woman. 
  Okay, well, customs forms require a local address, so if she helped him fill it out, then maybe she might know where he is. 
  Anna Ross. 
  Translator. 
  Yeah. 
  It was, um, "pom-og nay-mee" or something like that. 
  - This was your nephew speaking? 
  - Yeah. 
  Pomogni mi. 
  It means "help me" in Bulgarian. 
  - Excuse me. 
  - Sorry. 
  Yeah, motel living. 
  I thought I was coming home to a house in the suburbs, loving husband, but he served me with divorce papers as soon as I stepped foot out of the hangar. 
  You want to hear my version? 
  My fiancÃ© married my best friend, so What is it with men? 
  Five and a half years, they can't just keep it in their pants? 
  So, how can I help? 
  I am trying to track down Marko Valeriev. 
  Somebody said they heard him say the same phrase uh, pomogni mi on the plane. 
  Yes, he needed help filling out his forms. 
  Hell, he needed help the entire time we were in the hangar. 
  So you guys still kept in touch even after the plane landed? 
  He was a nice man. 
  I thought he was gonna reach out as soon as we got to the shelters, but, you know, everything else going on. 
  Sorry, uh, Marko went to a shelter? 
  It says here that he checked out of the hangar on his own. 
  No, that's a mistake. 
  For those of us that didn't have a place to go, they loaded us onto shuttles, and they took us to government shelters. 
  He got on one of the buses. 
  I watched him get on. 
  - Can you excuse me a sec? 
  - Yeah. 
  All right, thanks. 
  Let me know when you find out where they took him. 
  - I don't understand. 
  Why is Michaela trying to track down someone from the plane? 
  What does that have to do with Cal? 
  Ben? 
  What are you not telling me? 
  I don't know if I can explain. 
  I don't think you would believe me if I could. 
  I know I wouldn't. 
  Have you not been following the news story about the dead people who came back to life on a magic airplane? 
  I'm ready to believe just about anything at this point. 
  Grace something happened to us on that flight. 
  It keeps happening. 
  Some people are seeing things, hearing voices. 
  Ben, are you hearing voices? 
  You just said you were ready to believe anything. 
  I am. 
  I'm just I don't know. 
  I'm I'm trying to wrap my head around this. 
  Me too. 
  And I know this sounds impossible, but Cal's fever, I think it has something to do with what happened on the plane. 
  Please don't shut down now. 
  Tell me what you're thinking. 
  The last time Cal got sick, you went down a rabbit hole looking for every remedy, shutting out the world, shutting out me, and so I spiraled and shut you out. 
  I have replayed that again and again in my head over all these years. 
  I want us to be different this time. 
  I need us to be partners. 
  We are. 
  I promise. 
  But we need to know what happened on that flight, who's behind it. 
  Is it the government or one of the other passengers, some, I don't know, fluke of physics. 
  - We need to find out - No! 
  We don't. 
  This is the biggest mystery in the known universe. 
  There are other people trying to figure it out. 
  - Let them. 
  - Grace, I need Ben our son is sick. 
  He doesn't need you to be a scientist right now. 
  He needs you to be his father. 
  I need you to be his father. 
  Okay, uh, NYPD duty logs from the time that we were at the hangar. 
  Just one sec. 
  What happened to that personal day? 
  Forgot some stuff here. 
  I had to come back and get it. 
  Seriously? 
  - Who's your friend? 
  - Don't worry about it. 
  What the hell, Michaela? 
  Is Cal even sick? 
  Yeah, he is, I swear. 
  I just You swore to me this wasn't one of your things. 
  But yet here you are digging into something you're clearly not supposed to. 
  You know what? 
  I don't care anymore. 
  Do whatever you want. 
  Just leave me out of it. 
  Okay, uh, according to this, the day that we were released, the NYPD escorted four buses from a hangar to nearby government shelters. 
  No, not four. 
  There were five. 
  One went to FEMA in Long Island. 
  One went to a DHS facility in Lower Manhattan. 
  That's where you were taken. 
  One went to King's Point. 
  One went to Fort Lee, New Jersey. 
  There was one more. 
  I remember distinctly. 
  Marko needed help translating the instructions. 
  He was on bus five. 
  Yet, according to this, there was no bus five. 
  News footage doesn't lie. 
  She's right, there are clearly five buses here. 
  How is that even possible? 
  You don't just misplace a bus. 
  You do when you don't want people to know where it went. 
  The government's behind this. 
  Look at this. 
  So, I went back over the list of the people I can't find, and 11 of them, all who supposedly walked out of that hangar, don't appear anywhere on this news footage. 
  Every single one of them is either a foreign national or someone with no living relatives. 
  It was people no one was gonna miss. 
  That's who I think they put on that bus. 
  But why? 
  And where are they gonna go? 
  Hey Cal? 
  Hey, hey. 
  It's okay, it's okay. 
  His meds aren't working. 
  His temp hasn't come down. 
  I need a nurse in Room 2117. 
  It's okay, Mom's here. 
  It's okay. 
  It's okay. 
  It's okay, Mom's here. 
  Shh. 
  It's just a dream, it's just a dream. 
  Shh. 
  Okay, okay. 
  I'm here, I'm here. 
  I'm not going anywhere, okay? 
  Tell me you got something, Mick. 
  Cal's getting worse. 
  We got to find Marko. 
  Okay, I don't know what I've got, but it is something. 
  So, I ran the tags on the screen caps of the buses that you sent me. 
  The State Police's automatic license-plate reader got all five of them heading south after they left the hangar. 
  The entire caravan registered multiple hits tunnels, highway on-ramps. 
  Five buses, until they exited the thruway, then one of them disappeared. 
  Buses just don't disappear. 
  Why not? 
  Happens to airplanes. 
  Hey, Mick, where did you say that toll plaza was? 
  Exit 16 right outside of Woodbury. 
  Barn, barn. 
  These roads are too narrow. 
  I think the nurse's printing station is running out of ink, so there's got to be a more efficient way to solve this problem. 
  Well, we're kind of resource constrained. 
  Then again, maybe that's the point. 
  Maybe the calling wants to see how far we'll go. 
  What? 
  To see if we'll just blindly follow? 
  What happens when a calling tells us to do something that we don't actually want to do? 
  What? 
  Do you think I want to be playing "Find the Bulgarian"? 
  No, I mean like killing someone or blowing something up. 
  What do we do then? 
  Right now, that's not my problem. 
  I'm just trying to save my son. 
  - Hey. 
  - Hey. 
  I just sent you a map. 
  Now, the missing bus had to have disappeared sometime between when they left the thruway and when they hit Southfield. 
  Now, there's only a handful of roads they could've taken without tripping another scanner. 
  Then again, it couldn't have gone very far. 
  There's a ton of farmland out there but only a few buildings where they could've stashed a bus. 
  I've circled the ones I could find on the map. 
  - Okay, I'll go check them out. 
  - Hey. 
  Listen, I have no idea what you're gonna find out there, but I'm betting it's not friendly. 
  Take Jared? 
  Uh, yeah, that is a terrible idea. 
  I know. 
  But a necessary one. 
  I need your help. 
  I have to go check something out upstate. 
  I already told you to leave me out of it. 
  I can't. 
  Ben and I are trying to track down one of the passengers from the plane who went missing. 
  He has something to do with Cal being sick. 
  I think the government made them disappear. 
  You sound like one of those lunatics on television. 
  Thank you. 
  I'm well aware. 
  There were 11 passengers in the hangar who got on government buses but never showed up to any of the shelters. 
  And you know this how? 
  It doesn't matter, but if I'm right about this, then we are all in danger Ben, Cal, and me. 
  And if you're wrong again? 
  Then we'll have a nice country drive. 
  Fine, I'll go it alone. 
  - Michaela, hold up. 
  - No, you can't stop me. 
  I'm not. 
  I'm coming with you. 
  - Cal? 
  - Make it stop, please! 
  Shh, shh, I'm here, I'm here, I'm here. 
  Please, he's having nightmares. 
  His body's doing everything it can to cope, but it's too much. 
  We've got to get his temperature down. 
  Make it stop, please! 
  You're okay, you're okay. 
  And stop. 
  And now. 
  And stop. 
  He's responding differently than the others. 
  Might have something to do with his fever. 
  Try it on a higher setting. 
  Make it stop! 
  We've been at this for hours. 
  How many more of these places do we have to check out? 
  As many as it takes. 
  How old is this playlist? 
  Is this the same one from the Academy? 
  You don't mess with perfection. 
  Oh, perfection? 
  Uh, J, this playlist was ancient five years ago. 
  I would've had to go back in time for it not to be cheesy. 
  You know the rules. 
  My car, my music. 
  That's certainly big enough to hide a bus. 
  Or a bunch of animals that can go in a barn. 
  Pull over up there. 
  They have a guard house and security cams. 
  I highly doubt they're inviting us in for a tour. 
  We got guns and badges. 
  How are they gonna say no? 
  We're 50 miles outside of our jurisdiction. 
  Besides, I don't want to tip them off. 
  Damn it. 
  Mick, what are you doing? 
  Just go with me. 
  Mick, what the hell? 
  Folks lost? 
  This area's off-limits. 
  I know. 
  I, uh I told him, but he wanted to go for a drive. 
  This is a restricted area, sir. 
  Didn't you see the sign? 
  I must've just missed it. 
  Hey, do you have a jack in there? 
  The only one that we've got is one of those, uh, collapsible Miss, please keep your hands where I can see them. 
  Babe. 
  Babe, I'd do what the man says. 
  Sorry, what? 
  You want to help me with the spare, babe? 
  - Yeah. 
  - Thanks. 
  Sorry. 
  Mick, what the hell? 
  That guy had an automatic weapon. 
  Yeah, he wasn't the only one. 
  Hey, slow down a sec. 
  Mick, what the hell is going on? 
  No, not the red door! 
  Michaela, what the hell's happening? 
  I'll explain later. 
  Just drive. 
  He's getting worse. 
  You have to help. 
  Cal's heart rate is a little elevated, which may indicate that there's an infection that hasn't shown up on any of the tests. 
  Under normal circumstances, the next step would be to administer some wide-band antibiotics. 
  Why haven't we? 
  Because it's not without some risks. 
  Cal's cancer treatment is still experimental. 
  We don't know how antibiotics might affect it. 
  So you're saying we have to choose between his fever and his cancer treatment? 
  It's not that simple. 
  We don't want to disrupt his treatment, but we're having trouble controlling this fever. 
  And if it gets any worse So, what if the antibiotics don't work? 
  What if it isn't bacterial? 
  We'd be risking his cancer treatment over nothing. 
  Right now, we have to approach this from a medical perspective. 
  You're suggesting we make a bet that may endanger his life. 
  His life is in danger right now. 
  And we have limited options on how to approach this. 
  Antibiotics are the next arrow in our quiver. 
  Medicine is as much art as it is science. 
  - You know this. 
  - What I know is my son is sick, and every bone in my body is telling me that the thing that's causing it is something no one understands. 
  I don't want to risk a treatment that saved his life just to check off the next item on some list. 
  Believe me, I get that. 
  But we have limited options on how to approach this, and if we don't treat his fever, the cancer may not matter. 
  Jared, you can slow down. 
  They're not following us. 
  Michaela, enough is enough. 
  That's it, time for some answers. 
  Like, why did we just find a government black site guarded by a bunch of Blackwater wannabes? 
  And more importantly, why don't you seem at all surprised? 
  No, no, no, don't even think about telling me you can't explain, Michaela, or give me some half-truth. 
  - We're way past that now. 
  - You're right, okay? 
  You do deserve to know the truth, but I don't have the answers that you are looking for. 
  Try me. 
  It's me, okay? 
  I'm trying to help you here, can't you see that? 
  Please, tell me what's going on. 
  The cases that we solved, like the Pyler sisters, I had help. 
  I hear things. 
  Sometimes I see things, too. 
  - Like hallucinations? 
  - I am not crazy, J. 
  This is happening to a lot of us. 
  - Passengers on the flight? 
  - Yes. 
  Ben, too? 
  Look, you need to understand something. 
  - Michaela, you realize that. 
  - Let me finish, please. 
  These voices, they want us to fix things. 
  It's like a puzzle that we are being called to solve. 
  What does this have to do with that farm back there? 
  I don't know, but I think the government knows what is happening, and whatever's going on in that farm is a danger to all of us, especially Cal. 
  I need to call Ben and tell him what we found. 
  I'm sorry. 
  Okay, send me the picture. 
  I'll take it from here. 
  All right. 
  Grace. 
  I think we should hold off on the antibiotics. 
  Ben, we've been here before. 
  You know how it works. 
  Medical triage, we treat the most pressing issue first. 
  Right now, that is his fever. 
  And antibiotics are the right treatment if there's a medical reason. 
  Of course there's a medical reason. 
  I'm not so sure. 
  Look, Michaela just found what we've been looking for, - and if I can - Found what? 
  Grace, the government didn't release all the passengers. 
  Some they sent to a a farm upstate, and I think they're experimenting on these people, and Cal is somehow channeling what they're going through up there, - and I need to - Ben. 
 
 
 
  Ben. 
  Listen to yourself. 
  You sound crazy. 
  I-I know, but I need you to trust me. 
  How? 
  I don't even know who you are anymore. 
  You used to be the guy who would yell at anti-vaxxers on TV. 
  You think holistic medicine is a joke. 
  You read every single scientific article to try and find a cure for our son. 
  - What happened? 
  - The plane. 
  I'm still the same person, I swear. 
  But right now I know what I have to do. 
  Give me an hour. 
  You want to leave? 
  Now? 
  No, I want to stay here with you and Cal, but there's someone I have to talk to. 
  He can help. 
  So call him. 
  He's not someone I can get on the phone. 
  Please, I wouldn't be doing this if it wasn't the best way to help Cal. 
  I'll be back as soon as I can. 
  No, I don't care if I need an appointment. 
  I want to speak with Deputy Director Vance right now. 
  Sir, I'm gonna ask you one last time, please step back. 
  Look, tell him it's Ben Stone from Flight 828, and if he won't see me, I'm gonna go public with what I know. 
  Stay where you are. 
  No sudden moves. 
  Yeah, sir? 
  Yeah, we have a walk-in here at the east entrance. 
  Come on, Vance! 
  Have them put him in a room. 
  You son of a bitch, you took those people. 
  And whatever you're doing to them, it's killing my son. 
  Killing? 
  Wha Slow down a minute, now. 
  What? 
  Marko and the others, you're keeping them prisoner up at that farm. 
  My sister was just there! 
  And that that is a passenger. 
  Lena Rasmussen, seat 32-F. 
  You took her and the others, put them on that bus, and made them disappear. 
  - What is he talking about? 
  - No idea. 
  I want to see Marko Valeriev, now. 
  Another one of the passengers, Bulgarian. 
  We've been unable to locate him. 
  Come on, what is this, a bit? 
  Are you guys role-playing? 
  Stone, I'm a seasoned United States intelligence officer. 
  Do you really think you can stare me down? 
  I will go to the press about everything how you stole Kelly's body, had Bethany thrown in jail, - had every foreign national. 
  - Bethany Collins is in jail because she violated federal law. 
  A-A-And stealing a corpse? 
  You hear yourself? 
  This isn't "Invasion of the Body Snatchers. 
  " I don't believe you, and I certainly don't believe you. 
  I mean, we have photographic proof, and still, you insist on denying it! 
  Mr. 
  Stone, this may as well be a picture of Bigfoot. 
  Be happy to look into it. 
  I don't expect we'd find anything. 
  Let me just ask is it just the NSA, or is the whole government in on it? 
  See him out. 
  I'm gonna get to the bottom of this, and when I do Thank you very much, Mr. 
  Stone. 
  The truth will come out. 
  Get me the file on the list of passengers that he had on his phone. 
  You believe all that? 
  I can't get a straight answer from DoD, from Homeland, from DARPA. 
  I don't know what to believe. 
  Look, I know you've never been big on sharing, but you didn't have to keep this from me. 
  I would've understood. 
  How? 
  I don't understand it, and it's happening to me. 
  Come on, Mick, that's a cop-out. 
  You could've let me in. 
  You've known me almost half your life, and I've never once betrayed your trust. 
  Yeah, you're right, but things are a little different now. 
  You're not seriously thinking about going back there, are you? 
  Pull in Riojas and notify the feds. 
  The feds are in on it. 
  Look at this. 
  The farm that we were at was bank owned for years until two weeks ago, when it was purchased by a subsidiary of a holding company whose only shareholder is Unified Dynamic Systems. 
  UDS, the company that makes microwaves and washing machines. 
  Yeah, and jet engines and mouthwash and life insurance. 
  They are a multi-billion-dollar company with a ton of government contracts. 
  You think they kidnap people? 
  You tell me. 
  According to the DMV, the buses that relocated the passengers from the plane were contracted to the government by Unified Dynamic Systems. 
  Everything that I am coming across points back to UDS. 
  They're the ones who made the passengers disappear. 
  I don't suppose you know where my husband is? 
  Um, sorry, I don't. 
  You were on the plane. 
  What do you think of all this? 
  Is it tied to the flight? 
  I honestly don't know what to think. 
  On the one hand, my medical training tells me that there has to be an explanation for all of this. 
  But then on the other, we know that the human body is it's capable of far more than we can currently comprehend. 
  So you think we shouldn't give him the antibiotics? 
  I just know that we fought like hell to get him into the trial, and it would be a shame to derail that if antibiotics aren't the answer. 
  I mean, there's so much here we're only beginning to understand. 
  You sound just like Ben. 
  Look, I get it. 
  I know there are a million possible scenarios in the land of what if, - but this is my son. 
  - Mm-hmm, yeah. 
  Not some scientific curiosity. 
  Now's not the time for Ben to be chasing wild theories. 
  Or for you to be encouraging him. 
  I can only imagine how overwhelming all of this must be. 
  What's happening? 
  His heart rate is spiking. 
  I need Dr. 
  Williams in Cal Stone's room now. 
  What can we do? 
  Pulse is at 122. 
  Get me another line. 
  I need to push some fluids. 
  Something's wrong. 
  Help me get him on his side. 
  - Charge level? 
  - 70%, and he's already seizing. 
  Any more could kill him. 
  Reduce by 5%. 
  If he spikes, abort. 
  What is happening? 
  He's having a febrile seizure. 
  - Give him the medicine. 
  - Grace. 
  Give him the antibiotics, now. 
  Grace, no, if he is seizing, that means the infection is viral. 
  Antibiotics won't help him. 
  I'm done with you. 
  Please, give it to him. 
  Grace, listen to me. 
  Antibiotics aren't going to help him, and even if, by some miracle, they do, I can tell you 100%. 
  Cardoso is gonna kick Cal out of the study for deviating from the control group. 
  His treatment will end. 
  His cancer will come back. 
  Look, see? 
  He's coming out of it. 
  Ben is the only shot that Cal has. 
  Give him a chance. 
  Please. 
  Okay. 
  Sorry to bother. 
  Dr. 
  Williams said you probably hadn't eaten all day. 
  Oh. 
  Thank you. 
  One for your husband? 
  He's not here. 
  Do you mind Could you just stay with him? 
  I just need to Mrs. 
  Stone? 
  It's occupied! 
  Mrs. 
  Stone, he's waking up. 
  I called for Dr. 
  Williams. 
  She should be th Cal? 
  Cal? 
  Cal. 
  Can you hear me? 
  His fever broke. 
  Mom. 
  Hi. 
  Come here. 
  What happened? 
  He got lucky. 
  His body must've fought off the infection. 
  Is he conscious? 
  Barely. 
  Put him with the others. 
  Collect your files. 
  We're on the move. 
  Come. 
  Homeland sent over the 11 passenger dossiers you requested. 
  Five foreign nationals repatriated to their countries of origin, three people in the hospital listed as receiving inpatient care. 
  One in the Bureau prisons custody for an outstanding warrant two with no next of kin. 
  And a partridge in a pear tree. 
  According to DHS, everyone on Ben Stone's list has been accounted for. 
  This woman Michaela Stone photographed, who is she? 
  I have no idea, but it sure seems like the Stones are hearing hoofbeats and thinking zebras. 
  Thank you. 
  Subject 8-2-8, passenger Lena Rasmussen. 
  Observed today, 0600 hours, exiting residence in Karasjok, Norway. 
  Where the hell's Karasjok? 
  200 miles inside the Arctic Circle. 
  This look like the same person to you? 
  Might be. 
  Well, that sure as hell ain't Norway. 
  All right, time for a road trip. 
  How is he? 
  His fever's broken. 
  Without antibiotics? 
  What did you do? 
  Nothing helpful. 
  Well, he's better. 
  For now. 
  You left me alone when I needed you. 
  You can't ever do that again. 
  I'm sorry. 
  Shouldn't be too hard to keep alive. 
  Doesn't even need water. 
  You guys, what happened here today? 
  Cal is better. 
  That's all that matters. 
  Yeah, but how? 
  We were so convinced we needed to help Marko in order to save Cal, but we didn't. 
  We failed a calling. 
  Maybe we were wrong about the calling. 
  What about his nightmares, the red door? 
  I mean, you can't tell me this isn't about Marko or one of the other passengers. 
  And yet Cal is okay. 
  We get to count this one into the win column. 
  We still don't know how the callings work. 
  Maybe rescuing Marko wasn't the objective. 
  Maybe it was something we did along the way. 
  I don't know. 
  I have a feeling this isn't over. 
  I think we're still supposed to find Marko. 
  I'm guessing you got a game plan for that? 
  And to think you just met me. 
  This looks like the red door from the photograph. 
  What'd I tell you? 
  Ben Stone's putting you on. 
  I don't know what his angle is, but there are no passengers here. 
  Maybe, maybe not. 
  I had to make a lot of stuff disappear in my life. 
  If I had to do it, it'd look a lot like this. 
  And if there was never anyone here, what would it look like? 
  It wouldn't look like this. 
  Huh, still fresh. 
  No, ma'am, the subjects have been removed from the protocol. 
  We had to terminate the experiment because somebody in the NSA started poking around. 
  But the disruption was only temporary. 
  We just need to get the equipment set up, and we'll be back up and running in no time.
