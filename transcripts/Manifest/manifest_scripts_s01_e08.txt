 Previously on Manifest. 
  I had an urge to see the plane, I showed up, kaboom. 
  Help! 
  Fiona Clarke started her career a Clarke psychology, ended up being blackballed in her field for her fringe beliefs. 
  - Like what? 
  - Believing all of our brains can sync up to one another. 
  Like Cal and Marko Valeriev. 
  In the wake of any traumatic event, it's inevitable the participants eventually seek each other out. 
  So, it has nothing to do with you experiencing a calling. 
  I'm sorry, a-a calling? 
  His fever broke. 
  Mom. 
  This data can get me to the detainees, which might be the only way to protect my son. 
  You left me alone. 
  - I'm sorry. 
  - You can't ever do that again. 
  Hand over the flash drive, or you can be under arrest. 
  Vance Vance, you have to find them! 
  Vance! 
  Seriously? 
  No service? 
  Same. 
  See, buddy? 
  No reason to be scared. 
  We made it. 
  It's okay. 
  We're home. 
  I wasn't afraid of a flight. 
  I don't want to be in New York. 
  This is where I have cancer. 
  No more school, no more anything. 
  I don't want to die. 
  Hey. 
  Ew. 
  Fig Newtons? 
  - Really? 
  - Yeah. 
  Mom would always give them to me. 
  I'd wake up from a nightmare and she would bring me Fig Newtons and milk. 
  Mine was always - Mmm! 
  Mm-hmm. 
  - ice cream. 
  She always kept a stash of Rocky Road in the back of the freezer - "for emergencies. 
  " - "For emergencies. 
  " What's going on? 
  Cal wants to go back to school. 
  You know, he's going stir crazy. 
  He wants to be a normal kid doing normal things. 
  Grace is all for it, Dr. 
  Williams signed off But you're worried about it. 
  This is just a lull. 
  Whatever's happening to Marko, the testing, it could restart at literally any moment, and that means Cal gets sick again, and this time he might not survive. 
  You can't just lock him in his room, Ben. 
  Besides, we don't know that the testing is going to restart or when. 
  Mick, someone clearly discovered that the passengers are having callings. 
  The ability to see and hear what's going to happen? 
  That an incredibly powerful weapon for the military, for intelligence. 
  No. 
  This - This isn't over. 
  - Yeah, maybe not. 
  But, Ben, it might never be over. 
  Your family needs a new normal. 
  Let Cal go to school. 
  Focus on your wife. 
  You are lucky that you have her. 
  I am. 
  Besides, we need to assume that we're being watched. 
  So it's strategic to act normal. 
  So that when we do find the missing passengers, when we finally hit back? 
  They don't see it coming. 
  Keep me updated. 
  When will we be ready? 
  48 hours, give or take. 
  We're finalizing the clean room. 
  My source at the NSA tells me, Deputy Director Vance took an unexpected personal day. 
  And now he's offline, completely dark. 
  He could be inconveniencing us once again. 
  We've invested too much in this project to let Vance shut it down. 
  Accelerate the timeline I need you fully operational in 18 hours. 
  - I don't think that's possible. 
  - Make it possible. 
  Morning. 
  Milk, no sugar. 
  Well, whatever you are about to ask for, the answer is yes. 
  Well, actually, I'm the one saying yes. 
  You're right. 
  Cal should go back to school get his new normal on. 
  He's gonna be so happy. 
  On one condition. 
  We need our life back, too. 
  I mean, how long has it been since you and I went out to dinner? 
  My time or yours? 
  Forever. 
  Olive can babysit. 
  You and I tonight date night. 
  Are you sure? 
  Your new job has been keeping you so busy There's nothing more important than us our family. 
  Are we on? 
  I'll make a reservation. 
  I'm fine. 
  I feel good. 
  You do feel good. 
  So, first day at school are you nervous? 
  - No. 
  - All right. 
  Your mom's gonna take you on her way to work. 
  I don't need a ride. 
  I'll walk with Olive. 
  Backpack and shoes, let's go. 
  Guys, it's six blocks, and it's the same campus. 
  He can come with me. 
  After everything he's been through, I just want to make sure he's gonna be okay. 
  He'll be fine. 
  Okay, the last thing he needs is the mommy-drop. 
  First he was the cancer kid. 
  Now he's the 828 kid. 
  Let him just show up on day one being normal. 
  All right, but if you see anything strange or if Cal gets sick again, you've got I'll call and text and Snapchat. 
  Relax. 
  The wisdom of a 16-year-old. 
  Am I still driving you? 
  Can we get going? 
  Good morning to you, too. 
  Sorry. 
  It's just I'm trying to get Jared out of my head, and the captain insists we ride patrol together. 
  Maybe it's Jared who's insisting. 
  I got to get ready. 
  Have fun at work. 
  Hey. 
  See you tonight. 
  Check it out. 
  It's that 828 kid. 
  The plane. 
  Hey. 
  You're gonna do great. 
  All right, guys, school's open. 
  There you go. 
  Good morning. 
  Good morning. 
  Yo, Stone! 
  I see you coming in here late. 
  Busted. 
  Don't lose him. 
  There you are. 
  I'm on with ESU They're asking for you. 
  They got a jumper on top of a building at Freedman College. 
  - They need a detective? 
  - Guy was on Flight 828. 
  They've hit a wall. 
  ESU thinks that he might talk to you. 
  Stone! 
  Get your ass in here. 
  - What's up? 
  - You know about this? 
  Check it. 
  What site is that? 
  It's an 828 Fan Site. 
  There's a bunch of 'em. 
  We should post a pic of us, all right, a little, uh, publicity for, you know, the company. 
  - Yeah, I'd rather not. 
  - Buzzkill. 
  Seriously? 
  All right, people, let's go! 
  Fire-drill protocol, find your exit routes, let's keep it orderly. 
  Come on. 
  You pulled a fire alarm? 
  What are y Pulling a fire alarm would be visible and rudimentary. 
  I caused the fire alarm to happen. 
  What are you doing here, Vance? 
  I'm here because as it turns out we need each other. 
  You're Stone? 
  Yeah. 
  This is Detective Vasquez. 
  Dave Brandis, how you doing? 
  You recognize this guy? 
  - That's our jumper? 
  - That's Harvey Stein. 
  Yeah, I've met him a couple of times. 
  Yeah, well, he's a little bit troubled right now. 
  I'm gonna take you two up there, okay? 
  How long's he been up there? 
  Almost an hour. 
  He picked a perfect spot above a slanted roof. 
  There's nowhere to put the airbag. 
  Has anyone talked to the press? 
  Do they know he's Flight 828? 
  - No, I don't think so. 
  - Okay, let's keep it that way. 
  I went to this farm of yours. 
  If the passengers had been there, they've been moved, I presume to another facility. 
  So, what, you believe my crazy theories now? 
  I believe you're on the right track, yes. 
  So what happens now? 
  Did you get a location? 
  The data on the flash drive is raw. 
  Numbers, largely without context. 
  Measurements of some kind. 
  Nothing that remotely resembled an address. 
  At least not to me. 
  And you really want my help? 
  You were smart enough to steal this data. 
  Maybe you're smart enough to make sense of it. 
  Wait, why should I trust you with all the interrogations, the surveillance You're right, I've been treating you with suspicion. 
  No, you've been treating us like enemies. 
  I've been protecting my country. 
  That's my job. 
  Mr. 
  Stone Ben we're not that different. 
  I get what you're doing. 
  You're putting yourself at risk to protect your loved ones. 
  I respect it. 
  If we're gonna find these people, we're gonna do it by working together. 
  Well, you can start by giving the flash drive back. 
  This is an air-gapped computer. 
  I've loaded it with the flash-drive contents. 
  This is your new phone. 
  It's encrypted, untraceable. 
  My number's in there. 
  Call me when you've looked at the data. 
  I'll think about it. 
  - Harvey, you okay? 
  - Don't come over here! 
  Good? 
  It's Michaela Stone. 
  I was on the plane with you. 
  I'm one of the passengers. 
  Mick, please be careful. 
  I'm okay. 
  It's okay. 
  - You sure? 
  - Yeah. 
  Harvey. 
  Harvey, do you remember me? 
  I'm a cop. 
  I was at the hangar with you, after the plane exploded. 
  That's close enough. 
  I know why you're here, okay? 
  I know exactly what you are feeling right now. 
  I don't think so. 
  You've come back and the world's moved on and you don't know where you fit in anymore. 
  - I get it. 
  - No. 
  No, you don't. 
  That is not it. 
  That is not it. 
  Hello? 
  Professor, it's Ben Stone. 
  I hope I got you at a good time. 
  I think I may have found something. 
  About the missing passengers? 
  - Have you found where they are? 
  - No, not yet. 
  But the data I was able to download from the U. D. S. 
  cloud server? 
  Some of it's medical. 
  Saanvi thinks they're tracking heart rates, brain activity. 
  But there's something else. 
  Is it possible they're they're tracking electrical data? 
  Voltage levels? 
  Professor? 
  Oh, my God, the callings. 
  They're trying to artificially replicate them. 
  How? 
  Electro-cortical stimulation. 
  I used it on rats, trying to connect the brainwaves of multiple subjects. 
  Most of them died in the process. 
  What Singularity's doing is wildly theoretical and dangerous. 
  We have to stop these people, no matter what. 
  We will. 
  Hey. 
  Can't really talk right now, bro. 
  Uh, real quick, can you send me the U. D. S. 
  property risk reports from the last year? 
  I know, it's above my pay grade, but I need a Tier One sampling for the plus/minus. 
  Ah, yeah, they're not done yet. 
  U. D. S. is slow as ass updating their records, and anyway, I spend half my week in clients' offices taking meetings. 
  When am I gonna log risk reports? 
  God, I'm supposed to be at Wernax right now. 
  How about you let me lighten the load? 
  You know, I've been fooling around with this algorithm. 
  It'll convert everything to run as a batch file. 
  Oh, that's sexy. 
  Yeah, I can zip through our clients. 
  Just flip me the data. 
  Yeah. 
  I can't really punt the supervisory work - down the food chain, my man. 
  - Ronnie. 
  I'm under-utilized here. 
  Take advantage. 
  No one has to know. 
  Property acquisitions, U. D. S. , 12-month range Whoa. 
  9,600 properties. 
  - Piece of cake. 
  - Yeah? 
  Benjamin Stone, and send. 
  Okay, I have to roll. 
  Where's my Wernax ID? 
  Uh, it's here, on your desk. 
  Oh, okay. 
  Uh, end of day, no later. 
  Harvey, I'm gonna come closer now, okay? 
  Harvey. 
  I can see the house I grew up in. 
  This is my synagogue. 
  Me and Josh Klein, we used to smoke weed in the parking lot before Hebrew School. 
  I was 12 years old. 
  And now you feel like you don't belong here anymore, right, like, you're not the same person? 
  People are dying. 
  It has to stop. 
  I-I'm gonna be next. 
  That's the only way. 
  Harvey, who is dying? 
  Come on, you can You can tell me. 
  Who's gonna understand if not another passenger? 
  Talk to me, please. 
  I will understand. 
  Then you can understand this. 
  Harvey, no! 
  Stop! 
  No! 
  Michaela! 
  Oh my God, that's that's awful, I'm so sorry Mick, He's talking about people dying, and the next minute he's gone. 
  W-What people dying? 
  I don't know. 
  We're going to his place to figure it out. 
  There's more, Ben. 
  I had a calling this morning. 
  "Don't lose him. 
  " Did you have it? 
  No. 
  No, no. 
  "Don't lose him"? 
  Yeah, I thought it was about Jared, but it's it was about Harvey, don't lose Harvey, and I did. 
  I lost him. 
  It's more than getting it wrong, Ben. 
  I failed. 
  I failed the calling. 
  I have to go. 
  I I've got to find out why. 
  No, no, Mick Mick Okay, start at the beginning. 
  - You walked him in - Yep dropped him off at his classroom. 
  Mrs. 
  Henry was super excited to see him. 
  I'm gonna find him at lunch. 
  Okay? 
  All good. 
  Now, let me see. 
  Okay, well, I don't know - No? 
  - Mom, i-it's date night. 
  You're not going to church. 
  Okay, okay. 
  I like it, by the way. 
  Date night. 
  You and Dad used to do it every Friday when we were kids, remember? 
  And Grandma and Grandpa would babysit. 
  Of course I remember. 
  Let me call you right back, okay? 
  - Lourdes. 
  Hi. 
  - Hi. 
  I've been meaning to call, see how you're adjusting with everything. 
  Oh, good. 
  I mean, life is definitely way more hectic, but in a great way. 
  Way to make things. 
  even more awkward, Lourdes. 
  No, I'm sorry. 
  So not my business. 
  Jared and I always said once I got my Masters, we'd start trying, and my thesis just got approved. 
  - Congratulations. 
  - Yeah. 
  - That's amazing. 
  It's exciting. 
  - Thank you. 
  - And maybe a baby! 
  - Maybe. 
  Family. 
  Here you go, Detective. 
  Thanks. 
  We'll lock up. 
  Harvey had no family? 
  No kids? 
  5 1/2 years later, this is the life he comes back to. 
  Hey. 
  You did everything right. 
  If somebody makes up their mind to jump, there's zero you can do about it. 
  Yeah. 
  I just don't understand. 
  I-I remember him from the hangar. 
  He He was giving the NSA hell. 
  The guy was tough as nails. 
  I mean Jared. 
  People are dying. 
  Th-That's what he said. 
  I mean, he blamed himself for people dying. 
  But who are the people? 
  Mick. 
  Both died in the last few days. 
  But why? 
  Susan Creighton. 
  That's her. 
  O'Ryan's Tavern. 
  Harvey had that T-shirt. 
  Click on the hashtag. 
  Wait, there. 
  Monday night. 
  Zoom in. 
  Rick Moore. 
  He and Susan were at the pub along with Harvey Monday night. 
  And they both died a few days later. 
  Let's go. 
  Cal! 
  I'm not answering any questions. 
  I just want to eat my lunch. 
  - I have a question. 
  - What did he just say? 
  Tuna or Ham and Cheese? 
  It's gonna be one or the other because those are your favorites. 
  I remember. 
  Tuna, same as me. 
  I'll give you a string cheese for your Doritos. 
  Are you gonna make a Dorito sandwich? 
  Oh, my God, Piper, yes, you always used to make those. 
  I'm making one right now. 
  This brings me back. 
  Oh, my. 
  Yummy. 
  - Did you bring it? 
  - I did. 
  But you're not getting it till I know what it's for. 
  The flash drive gave me zero location data. 
  But I have obtained a list of every property acquired in the last two months by U. D. S. 
  The Singularity Project is their subsidiary. 
  How many properties? 
  Just over 700. 
  It's a needle in a haystack. 
  However, Professor Clarke met with them at their offices on the Upper East Side. 
  I was thinking, maybe if she went back in, she could place the bug. 
  No, it's too risky. 
  She'll get caught. 
  We have to find those passengers. 
  If the NSA is off the table, this is how we do it. 
  It's pre-activated. 
  All she has to do is place it. 
  Can you still get access to the Singularity Project server? 
  Probably. 
  Why? 
  We put a bug in there. 
  It could be days. 
  before we get anything useful. 
  - We do this in two steps. 
  - Right. 
  Plant the bug, and, uh, well, then we give them a little nudge. 
  I couldn't attend your talk in person, Professor, but I watched it online. 
  I'm dying to know more. 
  Well, m-my timing is good, then. 
  I I had a few ideas after our first conversation. 
  I thought you'd like to hear them. 
  You were interested, as I recall, in my work on mirror neurons. 
  Excuse me, Professor, I think you dropped something. 
  - I'll get it. 
  - Oh. 
  Thank you. 
  Clumsy. 
  My favorite pen I would've hated to have lost it. 
  I didn't go into a lot of the technical terms. 
  The basal ganglia, caudate nucleus I'm so sorry. 
  I'm gonna have to cut this short. 
  - Oh. 
  - Budget crisis. 
  I'll need to make a call. 
  Sam will show you out. 
  You can reschedule. 
  - Right. 
  - Thank you, Professor. 
 
 
 
  No, thank you. 
  It's Laurence. 
  We have a problem. 
  - Anything? 
  - Listen. 
  Somebody did a search, network-wide. 
  JP Williamson, the accounting firm "experiments" and "Flight 828. 
  " It worked. 
  We've already moved them to Brooklyn all 11, to the clean room. 
  - Thank you, Major. 
  - Major. 
  Major who? 
  Well, there are hundreds. 
  But military that's a start. 
  Well, it's not exactly a smoking gun. 
  Brooklyn narrows it down to maybe 25 properties. 
  I'll go back into the network, - look at the records. 
  - No, no, no. 
  You're already too exposed. 
  It's only a matter of time before they figure it out and come after you. 
  I don't care. 
  My - My son is in danger. 
  I'm gonna do what I have to do. 
  - End of discussion. 
  - All right. 
  You got three data points. 
  Farm upstate, the office on the Upper East Side, and now Brooklyn. 
  If I pull cellphone data, we can see how many phones pinged all three. 
  Wait. 
  I-I thought you said you wanted to stay in the shadows. 
  You said using NSA resources would show your hand. 
  I suppose this foolish bravery thing of yours is rubbing off on me. 
  Well, how can I help? 
  I'm supposed to meet Grace for dinner. 
  Go be with your wife. 
  You are on a ticking clock. 
  Make the most of it. 
  Harv was in here all the time. 
  Local celebrity, right? 
  Lot of free drinks. 
  He was here Monday night. 
  Do you remember anything special? 
  Monday? 
  Yeah, he got hammered. 
  - Put on quite the show. 
  - What does that mean? 
  You know how the plane exploded a couple of days after it landed? 
  Harvey claimed he knew it was gonna happen. 
  Beforehand. 
  - He told you that? 
  - Only like four times. 
  And not just me anyone who would listen. 
  This is Susan Creighton, Rick Moore. 
  - They were both here that night. 
  - Yeah, sure. 
  - They're both regulars. 
  - Are you aware they both passed? 
  Excuse me? 
  Hey, Lois, give me another. 
  Hey, give me a second. 
  He called himself the angel of death. 
  He must have thought it was connected. 
  What was connected? 
  He told people about these callings, and then they died. 
  That's why he killed himself. 
  - That's crazy. 
  - What if it's not, Jared? 
  I-I told you about the calling. 
  What if Harvey was right? 
  I pulled the M. 
  E. 
  reports. 
  Susan Creighton's blood alcohol was 0. 
  23. 
  She should've barely been able to walk stumbled out into the street and got hit by a bus. 
  Rick Moore. 
  Training for a marathon, out on a five-mile run, drops dead. 
  He had a massive arterial blockage. 
  Mick, these people. 
  were going to die regardless. 
  It had nothing to do with Harvey or what he did or didn't tell them. 
  How do we know it's not the universe pulling the strings? 
  What does that even mean? 
  Look, don't let this guy get into your head. 
  He was just a lonely, disturbed man If something happened to you, Jared? 
  Because of me? 
  I couldn't live with that, either. 
  I'm right here. 
  Okay? 
  I'm 100% alive. 
  Oh, "Le Rouge. 
  " Goes with the smokin' hot eyes. 
  - I want to celebrate, too. 
  - You will, buddy. 
  You and Olive are gonna make popcorn and hang out. 
  Or we can order pizza and invite Kevin over. 
  Okay. 
  He's already had a pretty big day. 
  We won't stay up late, and we'll just watch some TV. 
  - In bed by 10:00! 
  - I know! 
  - Hey. 
  Hi. 
  - Hello. 
  Wow, you look amazing. 
  Where's Ben? 
  Uh, he is running late. 
  He's still at work? 
  Yeah, we're gonna meet at the restaurant. 
  What about you tonight? 
  I'm gonna go to the gym, bath, and sleep. 
  It's been that kind of day. 
  What's up? 
  Um I'm not trying to stir the pot. 
  But after what I said this morning about Jared I saw Lourdes today. 
  I was shopping, and I just happened to run into her. 
  Okay. 
  And And she was buying a fertility kit. 
  She said that she and Jared had a plan, as soon. 
  as she got her master's degree, they would start trying. 
  I'm sorry. 
  I want you to be happy, Mick. 
  I want you to have a full life. 
  But it sounds like Jared's moving on. 
  Yeah, and so should I. 
  Hi. 
  Just, uh I see her. 
  Thank you. 
  - Hi. 
  - Mm. 
  You look incredible. 
  So, how did everything get sorted out at work? 
  Well, the trains are back on track. 
  How was Cal's first day? 
  Well, according to Olive, he killed it. 
  Hi. 
  Hi. 
  I'm glad we're doing this. 
  It's a lot of time to make up for. 
  To a new beginning. 
  To you To your new job, to our new life together, to the new us. 
  I'm so proud of you, Ben. 
  To the future. 
  To the future. 
  You wanted to see me? 
  Oh, Tabitha, good. 
  I need to run a triangulation. 
  Last 48 hours. 
  Every cellphone that's been in all three of these locations Upstate New York, just off the throughway here, Upper East Side, here. 
  Well, basically all of Brooklyn. 
  Copy. 
  Which op? 
  I need to assign a file number to the request. 
  Don't worry about it. 
  I'll take care of it. 
  Yes, sir. 
  Trish was so mad. 
  I don't blame her. 
  Looks like you guys had a good time. 
  - How are the kids? 
  - Oh, I just got home, but apparently, they didn't burn the house down. 
  I'll go check on them. 
  Hey. 
  You okay? 
  Yeah. 
  I'm totally fine. 
  Don't be long. 
  You guys have fun out on the town? 
  You were right. 
  She needed that. 
  Little does she know I'm gonna lose my job before I get my first paycheck. 
  What's the latest? 
  The passengers are somewhere in Brooklyn. 
  Vance is trying to narrow it down. 
  He should've called by now. 
  It's taking too long. 
  I got to tell you something about Harvey. 
  He told people about his callings. 
  Two of those people died. 
  He was convinced. 
  that there was a connection. 
  That is why he jumped. 
  I-I told Grace. 
  You told Jared. 
  Do you think Harvey was right? 
  He was pretty unhinged. 
  Technically, there's an explanation for these people's deaths. 
  And I failed the calling. 
  What if we're being punished? 
  Or about to be. 
  Hey, guys. 
  She's back here. 
  Power line came down. 
  She was out for a cigarette touched the Dumpster, got electrocuted. 
  Go figure. 
  Just, uh, keep your distance until they give us the green light. 
  The bartender. 
  That's three, Jared. 
  That is three people that Harvey told about the calling that are now dead. 
  You're not gonna worry about this, all right? 
  I still don't buy the whole "angel of death" thing. 
  Mick, Harvey told. 
  half the people in that bar. 
  There's no way all those people are gonna die. 
  Look, this is straightforward, okay? 
  Just I got it. 
  Go home. 
  - Get some rest. 
  - I need you to stop. 
  I need you to stop taking care of me, okay? 
  I shouldn't be here. 
  If I hadn't come back, you wouldn't be scared for your life right now. 
  All of this is my fault. 
  - Mick, wait - No. 
  No, stop. 
  You're trying to start a family with Lourdes. 
  She told you? 
  She told Grace. 
  And of course you should. 
  I am not going to get in the way of that. 
  Don't lose him. 
  Hey. 
  It's really late, bud. 
  Something wrong? 
  Did something happen at school? 
  School was fun. 
  I saw all my old friends, but I'm afraid if I close my eyes, it'll all be gone. 
  That won't happen. 
  What if it does? 
  I want to keep going. 
  You will. 
  I promise. 
  Listen, I'm gonna go make sure of that right now, okay? 
  I won't let anyone hurt you. 
  19 cellphones that pinged all three locations. 
  Of those, we can rule out 17 FedEx, limo drivers, delivery trucks. 
  That leaves two cellphones, both of which pinged cellphone towers in Red Hook. 
  - Both of which are burners - It's got to be them. 
  and both of which are employing a high-level masking protocol. 
  There may be four agencies in the world that have it, including NSA. 
  So you can't pinpoint where they are right now? 
  No, but look at this. 
  They've been pinging this tower in Red Hook last few hours. 
  It's somewhere inside this radius. 
  That That list you got, the Brooklyn properties, - were there any - In Red Hook? 
  No, I went through 'em. 
  - You sure? 
  - Yeah, I got them right here. 
  Gas stations, a couple of businesses. 
  None of What is it? 
  I was going by location, not by date of acquisition. 
  Look. 
  None of these properties were obtained within the last month. 
  Well, that fits the timeline. 
  Your plane came back three weeks ago. 
  They bought the property shortly after. 
  Which also wasn't in the records. 
  That means there's. 
  nothing recent in the database. 
  So someone inside U. D. S. is suppressing information. 
  No. 
  No, I don't think so. 
  Honestly, I think they're just slow as ass. 
  Ronnie, my idiot supervisor, told me that U. D. S. is behind logging in their property acquisitions. 
  The The paperwork's got to be on a desk somewhere in the U. D. S. 
  Records Department. 
  There's a pass on Ronnie's desk. 
  It'll get me into the U. D. S. building. 
  Then what? 
  There'll be cameras everywhere. 
  Once they figure it out, you'll be fired, then you'll be arrested. 
  What's your better idea? 
  You said yourself, there's a ticking clock. 
  How else are we gonna save the missing passengers, save my son? 
  Good evening. 
  Brooklyn. 
  U. D. S. 
  No. 
  Uh, Red Hook. 
  Oh. 
  Okay, no. 
  No. 
  Unh-unh. 
  Yes. 
  Bartender, too. 
  I had another calling with Jared. 
  - "Don't lose him. 
  " - I think that Jared might be in danger. 
  And Grace We have to do something. 
  We can't just wait We are doing something. 
  We're finding the missing passengers. 
  The more we can learn about the callings, the better. 
  Here's your property. 
  Chemical warehouse, Red Hook. 
  Yeah, that makes sense. 
  Red Hook is its own world. 
  Down by the water. 
  - No public access. 
  - That's the place. 
  We got to get there and stop them. 
  I just hope we can do it in time. 
  Looks good. 
  We're testing the current now. 
  The rest will be online soon.
