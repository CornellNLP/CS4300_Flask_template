 MICHAELA: No one can explain what happened to us on April  ,     .   
 Some people called it impossible.   
 Others called it a miracle.   
 All I know is...   
 it was the day my life changed forever.   
 If you'd seen us that afternoon,   
 you probably would have thought we looked like   
 a typical American family returning home from vacation.   
 My brother, Ben, and his wife, Grace,   
 still in love after    years.   
 Their twins, Olive and Cal,   
 always bickering like an old married couple.   
 And the real old married couple...   
 my parents.   
 Still in perfect health, still trying to run my life.   
 It's not just about you.    
 This family needs something to celebrate.    
 Okay, that's a pretty backwards reason for a wedding, but...    
 STEVE: How's  this  for a reason?    
 Jared loves you.    
 And I know you love him.    
 Typical, right?   
 But what you couldn't see is that Cal's leukemia   
 wasn't responding to treatment...   
 or that Ben and Grace   
 were desperately struggling to find a cure...   
 or that I still had nightmares about the car accident.   
 Michaela Beth, even people that have made mistakes deserve happiness.    
 [SCOFFS]    
 You know my favorite verse...    
 "All things work together for good."    
 I don't believe that anymore, Mom. How can I?    
 Which is why, when I got the chance to stay away from home   
 for even a few more hours, I jumped at it.   
 WOMAN: All passengers for Flight     to New York,    
 John F. Kennedy Airport, your attention, please.    
 This flight is oversold.    
 We are offering travel vouchers in the amount of $   for anyone willing to take a later flight.    
 Yes. That's me.    
 - No. 
- It's $    per person.    
 That's our next trip down to the Mayo Clinic.    
 I'll stay with Dad.    
 There you go. Man time.    
 BEN: All right. All right.    
 So Grace and Olive and my folks   
 took the first flight home   
 while Ben and Cal and I waited for Flight    .

 Wow. Uh...     
 Okay, uh, unfortunately, his diagnosis date is outside the study parameters.     
 He's lived with this disease for more than six years.     
 No, excuse me. For him, it hasn't been six years.     
 Now, if this boy needed treatment before he got onto that plane, he undoubtedly would need it now.     
 Of course, I understand how you feel, but... we can't risk breaking protocol.

 The exact same thing that happened to me.     
 We both got a second chance.     
 To start over, to live.     
 And I can't explain to you why or how, but I'm not ruling out that just maybe he came back to be saved and I came back to save him.
