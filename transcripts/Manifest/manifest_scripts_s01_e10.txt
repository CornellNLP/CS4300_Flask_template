 Previously on "Manifest" You've all been missing, presumed dead, for 5 1/2 years. 
  - Who is she? 
  - Lourdes. 
  The government didn't release all the passengers. 
  I think they're experimenting on these people, and Cal is somehow channeling what they're going through. 
  I still feel them. 
  [MOANING] 
  [ELECTRICITY CRACKLING] 
  I found a remote property. 
  I'm going to take them there. 
  They'll be safe with me. 
  Just get him to trust you. 
  Be specific, but nothing useful. 
  Olive's not my kid. 
  But I stepped in when you were gone. 
  When she comes to me, I-I can't turn her away. 
  I thought that we could just start over right where we left off. 
  I don't know you. 
  I don't think this is right anymore. 
  Find out why he's looking into us, what he knows, and who he's working with. 
  Is that perfectly clear? 
  Yeah. 
  [BIRDS CHIRPING] 
  I miss you so much, Mom. 
  Everything has been such a mess since we got back. 
  It was supposed to be happily ever after. 
  But after 5 1/2 years, you can't just pick up where you left off. 
  Everyone moved on. 
  Except us. 
  So now we start over. 
  The government thinks we're criminals. 
  Other people think we're angels, or saints or guinea pigs to be experimented on. 
  Innocent people are getting hurt. 
  Jared almost died. 
  What kind of cop am I if I can't protect the people that I love? 
  What kind of person am I if I love a man who can't love me back? 
  "All good things. 
  " What I would do to hear you say that one more time. 
  I wouldn't say I don't believe. 
  I would say that I want to. 
  Because there has got to be a reason this is happening to us. 
  I don't know what it is. 
  But I know one thing. 
  I want my life back.

  [CELLPHONE BUZZES] 
  Help! 
  Help! 
  Help! 
  [ENGINES ROARING] 
  - What's wrong? 
  - They all jerked. 
  All at the same time. 
  Like fingers in a light socket. 
  It was freaky. 
  Are you sure? 
  Um, yeah. 
  Like that. 
  Could be a reflex. 
  It could be, uh, residual brain trauma from the experiments. 
  But all at once? 
  It It's like they're still connected. 
  We need to bring the passengers together. 
  Analyze their experiences. 
  And warn them. 
  191 passengers? 
  At least the ones that were drawn to the airport when the plane exploded. 
  Do you think they'll cooperate? 
  I mean, if seeing what happened to their fellow passengers doesn't convince people to stick together These were the low-hanging fruit. 
  Any single one of us could be next.

  - [CLATTERING] 
  - MICHAELA: Whoa! 
  Hey! 
  This is my apartment, remember? 
  If anyone has dibs to trash it, it's me. 
  There's got to be an answer here. 
  I just don't see it. 
  [SIGHS] 
  I'm sorry. 
  - Where'd you go? 
  - I went to go see Mom. 
  I gave her quite the earful. 
  She was always the best listener. 
  Did it help? 
  It felt good to be there. 
  To do something. 
  Yeah. 
  Tell me about it. 
  I'm going out of my mind here. 
  All I want to do is protect Grace and the kids, and now I can't even be with them. 
  Grace is gonna take you back. 
  If I can just put this to bed, life goes back to normal. 
  It has been 10 days. 
  No callings. 
  Maybe it's over. 
  Maybe the lab explosion reset everything. 
  You really believe that? 
  I want to, yeah. 
  It's better than letting it drive me crazy. 
  [LAUGHS] 
  Meaning what I'm doing? 
  You said it, not me. 
  [SIGHS] 
  - Hey, where are you going? 
  - It's Vance's memorial today. 
  MICHAELA: What, you think it's a good idea to go to that? 
  I'll keep a low profile. 
  And I got to pay my respects. 
  He died helping us. 
  And? 
  And maybe I'll get a lead. 
  Come on. 
  Isn't it Cop 101 go to the murder victim's funeral, look for a guilty killer? 
  Not quite like that. 
  And you're not a cop. 
  No, but I'm a dad, and I've got to protect my son. 
  Cal channeled Marko. 
  Cal found the detainees under that warehouse. 
  My kid is at the center of everything happening to us. 
  I've got to know why. 
  It just It just might save his life. 
  [EXHALES DEEPLY] 
  [BIRDS CHIRPING] 
  You almost died. 
  You could take another week off. 
  I feel great. 
  As in great great? 
  [CHUCKLES] 
  Pretty damn good. 
  Well, I know another way that we can beat the boredom. 
  And it doesn't involve going to work. 
  Hmm. 
  And not to kill the mood, but I'm ovulating. 
  Or not. 
  Look, after everything I went through, I just I just need a beat, okay, just to get my bearings back. 
  - That's it. 
  - Mm, babe, I get it. 
  No pressure. 
  We got all the time in the world. 
  - Mm. 
  - Thank you. 
  [SIGHS] 
  Frozen waffles. 
  This is bad. 
  They still taste good. 
  She's in a dark place. 
  - She misses Dad. 
  - [TOASTER POPS] 
  Don't you? 
  Of course. 
  GRACE: Here you go. 
  A little bit crispy, but nothing some extra maple syrup won't hide. 
  Thanks, Mom. 
  Yeah, I've got to go. 
  I have this, like, study thing before school. 
  - See ya. 
  - Oh. 
  Why can't Dad come home? 
  [DOOR OPENS AND CLOSES] 
  He just needs some time to take care of some things. 
  And we agreed that it'd be best to do them while he was living with your Auntie Mick. 
  Don't eat that. 
  How about smoothies on the way to school? 
  Sure. 
  [CLICKING] 
  An esteemed NSA Deputy Director, a man of honor and dignity, Robert Vance died as he lived in service of our great country, uncovering a domestic terror cell's bomb-making operation in Red Hook. 
  Our heartfelt condolences to Estelle and the Vance children, as well as Bobby's friends. 
  Bobby wasn't a particularly social man, eschewing small talk, but anyone who knew him saw that the loyalty he showed this country could only be matched by his devotion to his friends and especially family. 
  Bobby's father fought and died in Vietnam. 
  When I met Bobby, the first story he told me was of his devoted mother You have some nerve showing up here. 
  You got him killed. 
  Look, I don't know what you think Show some respect and leave. 
  [MAN SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY] 
  Hey. 
  Ben Stone, right? 
  Don't tell me you believe that story about mad bombers. 
  We both know it's not true. 
  I'm Aaron Glover. 
  I'm a journalist. 
  My podcast is "828-Gate. 
  " Podcast. 
  That's still a thing? 
  Yeah, it's very much a thing. 
  You should have a listen. 
  Nope. 
  No comment. 
  You can't stop me from reporting that I saw you here. 
  And having a moment with Agent Powell. 
  You seem to be pretty cozy with the NSA. 
  My listeners are gonna wonder why. 
  Say what you want about the government. 
  But I'm a private citizen. 
  Keep me out of your story. 
  You are the story. 
  [SCOFFS] 
  Look, I don't know you, I don't know your podcast, but you're wasting your time. 
  - I've got nothing for you. 
  - Maybe I have something for you. 
  Why did a chopper drop off the Major at that factory in Red Hook an hour before the whole thing goes boom? 
  Major who? 
  I don't know, but whoever it was is still out there. 
  Still a threat. 
  What can you do about it? 
  You need allies, and I can deliver them. 
  Just give me a statement. 
  What, and blow up my life to launch your career? 
  - No, thanks. 
  - You know check out the podcast. 
  You'll see I want to do this right. 
  Did you reach all 20? 
  18, minus Harvey and Kelly. 
  Uh, most of them can make it. 
  Thanks for getting here so quickly. 
  Ben's right behind me. 
  I recognize this guy from the airport. 
  Yeah. 
  Paul Santino. 
  He's a local. 
  His wife was a no-show at the hangar. 
  Abandoned. 
  You and me both, buddy. 
  [WHISPERING] 
  Find her. 
  [GASPS] 
  Are you okay? 
  Michaela? 
  Did you just have a calling? 
  [BREATHING HEAVILY] 
  Yeah, but that was not like the other ones. 
  I was transported to a blizzard, and I heard, "Find her. 
  " What did you do to him? 
  I don't know. 
  Yeah, I don't I don't I don't understand. 
  What What is this place? 
  Who are you people? 
  Do you remember a plane? 
  - Do you know what year it is? 
  - What happened to me? 
  That's what we're trying to figure out. 
  What is the last thing that you remember, Paul? 
  Is that my name? 
  Paul Santino. 
  You have a wife Helen. 
  I'm married? 
  That, uh That doesn't doesn't feel right. 
  Are you sure? 
  You know what? 
  I'll double-check. 
  Sounds like complete amnesia. 
  Probably happened with the electro-shock tests. 
  Can we try to see if you can wake up another one? 
  - I'm not magic, Saanvi. 
  - I know. 
  I have been trying around the clock to help them. 
  Nothing is working. 
  I would be crazy not to try. 
  Hey, Marko. 
  Marko? 
  See? 
  I am not magic. 
  Could be a coincidence. 
  Or neuroplasticity. 
  Their catatonia could be the body's way of forcing the brain to rest and rebuild neural pathways. 
  - Heal themselves. 
  - You're the doctor. 
  Okay, so I should be able to do more than just keep them alive. 
  Maybe that is exactly what you are supposed to be doing giving them time to heal. 
  They will wake up when they're ready. 
  Or when they're called. 
  You have to find her. 
  Paul's wife Helen. 
  Maybe. 
  I've been wrong about the callings before. 
  You two share the same story. 
  His wife didn't show up to the hangar. 
  Neither did Jared. 
  - Maybe you two are connected. 
  - I don't know. 
  There's got to be a reason why he woke up just now, even if we can't see it. 
  It's like the boy with Evie's heart. 
  I think you're supposed to help Paul. 
  BETHANY: Everywhere I go, those crazy cult people are watching me. 
  They were waiting for me outside the court the minute I made bail! 
  Has anyone else had contact with the Believers? 
  Finally someone taking charge. 
  Maybe you can help me get my life back, too. 
  I went from entrepreneur wunderkind to out on my ass. 
  Hang on, Adrian. 
  We're all on the same side here. 
  Now, you all showed up when the plane exploded, so we know you've had strange experiences since we landed. 
  Has anyone had one in the last 10 days? 
  - A vision, maybe? 
  - You know something we don't. 
  Today something happened to me. 
  I It was like I was transported into a snowstorm. 
  - Okay. 
  What does that mean? 
  - We don't know. 
  But what we are sure of is that we have to share information. 
  But what good will that do? 
  It might just save your lives. 
  As some of you know, I study shared consciousness, like the callings you've all experienced. 
  I don't think it was an accident I was on that flight with you. 
  I think I was there to be an interpreter. 
  You're all welcome here. 
  A friend of mine lent me the use of this place until the spring. 
  She studies "shared consciousness" and just happens to be on the plane? 
  Coincidences happen. 
  So do conspiracies. 
  Think about it. 
  What if this whole thing is her twisted science experiment? 
  - She's been a help to us. 
  - Well, sure she has. 
  She's trying to get you to trust her. 
  It has to stop. 
  Things can't fall into the wrong hands. 
  Things? 
  Captain, if you know something that can help Maybe I do, and maybe I don't. 
  But whatever's going on, I'm gonna figure it out alone. 
  You don't have to. 
  Let me Look, you weren't in that cockpit. 
  No one's blaming you for what happened to MA 828. 
  You can't help me. 
  Coming here was a waste of time. 
  [SIGHS] 
  Sorry. 
  I wasn't eavesdropping. 
  I mean, I was, but he seemed so aggro. 
  Yeah, at the farm, do you remember ever coming across someone called the Major? 
  Is that a yes? 
  I-I overheard them on speakerphone talking to someone they called Major. 
  Laurence was scared, like the way you are with someone who's way more powerful than you are. 
  He was apologetic, asking for more money. 
  The Major said money wasn't a problem. 
  "The Grail is priceless. 
  " Holy Grail? 
  I remember 'cause it was a weird thing to say. 
  No clue what it meant. 
  Ah. 
  Whatever the Major's looking for, she wants it. 
  Bad. 
  She? 
  Michaela's calling. 
  "Find her. 
  " Are you positive the Major is a woman? 
  Yeah. 
  That a big deal? 
  It just might be. 
  Thank you. 
  [CELLPHONE BUZZES] 
  Where'd you go? 
  You're not dead. 
  You're not in jail. 
  Come on. 
  You got to be out there somewhere. 
  Right here, actually. 
  Not me you were looking for? 
  I didn't expect you to be back to work so soon. 
  You know, you could've milked the "almost died" thing for way more sick days. 
  Doc gave me the green light. 
  And, uh, I wanted to talk to you. 
  Later, okay? 
  I'm hot on this missing-persons thing. 
  It's the wife of one of the detainees. 
  Riojas signed off on me investigating it. 
  Okay. 
  Bring me up to speed. 
  Uh, he's an attorney, serious money. 
  Looks like she lost everything after 828. 
  Last known address that we have is some crappy street in Astoria. 
  - Social media? 
  - Zero presence. 
  She didn't come to the hangar. 
  I mean, everything that I found suggests a loving couple. 
  So why didn't she show? 
  You think something happened to her. 
  I don't know what to think. 
  She vanished. 
  Let's go find her. 
  [TAILGATE CLOSES] 
  Surprise. 
  Now, there's a face I've missed. 
  Same. 
  How about I cancel my bike ride and we can hit the climbing gym? 
  One step closer to Acadia. 
  Or you could come see us. 
  Olive, I-I'd love that, but it's really up to your mom. 
  [SIGHS] 
  She's not gonna ask. 
  I can tell she misses you, but it's like she's punishing herself. 
  Give her time to process. 
  Well, it's like they died all over again. 
  She's barely smiling. 
  She's not eating. 
  Seeing her like that messed me up more than the plane, and I can't do it again. 
  And I don't want you to. 
  Then if you still love us help me help her. 
  Please. 
  AARON: During the 5 1/2 years the plane was missing, the flight path, weather patterns, and telemetry have been exhaustively studied. 
  The NTSB report took 18 months. 
  And it's full of holes. 
  But I'm not giving up. 
  I'll find the truth. 
  [DOORBELL RINGS] 
  Oh hi. 
  Hi. 
  I thought I had them today. 
  Uh, Cal asked me to come. 
  I figured he told you. 
  Oh. 
  No. 
  CAL: Dad! 
  Hey, buddy. 
  [CHUCKLES] 
  How was school? 
  Good. 
  Uh, come on. 
  I've been working on my shot. 
  Almost. 
  Use your legs. 
  Why won't Mom let you come home? 
  Mom's not keeping me away, buddy. 
  There's just things I got to take care of. 
  Things to keep us all safe. 
  I know. 
  But why can't you do any of that here? 
  I wish I could, buddy. 
  Hey. 
  Mom and I both love you a ton. 
  Two tons. 
  [CHUCKLES] 
  Two tons of love weighs the same as two tons of rocks. 
  So basically, you're crushing me. 
  [LAUGHS] 
  You want to crush this ball? 
  - Yeah. 
  - Crush it. 
  Crush it! 
  [BEEP] 
  I'm Aaron Glover, and that's all for this week's episode of "828-Gate," but you don't want to miss next week's episode, CHAPTER SIX: "Closing in on the Holy Grail. 
  " [BEEP] 
  next week's episode, CHAPTER SIX: "Closing in on the Holy Grail. 
  " AARON: Glad you decided to trust me. 
  I haven't yet. 
  But answer my questions, and I might. 
  What did you mean by "The Holy Grail"? 
  Just something a confidential source said. 
  Not good enough. 
  I won't name names. 
  Right after 828 returned, Senate Intelligence Committee, House Appropriations started having secret meetings. 
  In which they earmarked millions to preserve the phantom shiner. 
  It's a fish. 
  Hasn't been seen since the 1940s, so why earmark funds? 
  To pay for a clandestine operation. 
  Look at you. 
  But all my source had was a fragment of a conversation he overheard. 
  A senator said, "It's the Holy Grail. 
  " We have to be the first, or 828 blows up in our face. 
  " The Holy Grail? 
  You think that's what the Major's looking for? 
  No, not literally. 
  This isn't Arthurian legend. 
  But it's something big. 
  It's time to go on the record. 
  Not yet. 
  We're still on background. 
  But I will tell you this the Major on that chopper was a woman. 
  - What's her name? 
  - Don't know yet. 
  The chopper could lead us to it. 
  I'm assuming you traced it. 
  My source told me it was a military Black Hawk. 
  We need Intel access. 
  CIA, NSA. 
  Powell. 
  Vance's deputy. 
  - Can you trust him? 
  - Oh, hardly. 
  But I trust his loyalty to Vance. 
  The thing is, I'll never get through the NSA's front door. 
  But your sources could find me a side entrance. 
  [SIREN WAILING IN DISTANCE] 
  [KNOCK ON DOOR] 
  [DOOR HINGES CREAK] 
  MICHAELA: That's not a good sign. 
  Hello? 
  NYPD. 
  [DOOR CLOSES] 
  Newspapers, mail. 
  This isn't looking like a planned vacation. 
  I do not want to know what it looks like inside that carton. 
  November 6th. 
  That's two days after 828 returned. 
  - Causing her to leave in a hurry? 
  - Yeah, or taken. 
  Maybe the same people who took Paul took Helen. 
  I have to find her. 
  You had a calling, didn't you? 
  When? 
  What was it? 
  Are you reading my mind now? 
  I know you, Mick. 
  I need to go back to the beach house and see Paul again. 
  Try and jog his memory. 
  Maybe he remembers relatives or friends - who might be able to help. 
  - Yeah. 
  Okay. 
  Let's go. 
  Why don't you stay here and search the place? 
  Maybe start with the mail. 
  Are you trying to ditch me now? 
  Paul's delicate. 
  It's better if I go it alone. 
  PAUL: I don't recognize her. 
  How can I not remember my own wife? 
  What happened to me? 
  I just want my life back. 
  Believe me, I know. 
  [CELLPHONE CHIMES] 
  Listen, we're gonna find her, okay? 
  And I'm sure once you see her, it'll all come back. 
  [WHISPERING] 
  Find her. 
  Find her. 
  It just happened again. 
  Yeah. 
  But these callings are so different, Ben. 
  I thought it was about the words, but the blizzard, the wind, it just it feels more vital. 
  Like it's not just about finding Helen. 
  I don't know what the snow means, but this mystery Major is a woman. 
  And we definitely need to find her. 
  Maybe Paul's wife isn't who we're after. 
  Okay. 
  Until we know what's going on, I think we should look for both. 
  - Hey. 
  - Hey, guys. 
  I got your message. 
  What's up? 
  Uh, this is gonna sound crazy. 
  I think our operational baseline is 10 points up from crazy. 
  Well, this is gonna turn it up to 11. 
  Two sources told me that the Major is looking for the Holy Grail. 
  - Right. 
  - Yeah, I didn't think so either. 
  But she's used the phrase twice, so it's got to be code for something specific. 
  What is she chasing? 
  Same thing we are. 
  Answers. 
  To what's happened, what's causing the callings, how to control them. 
  I'll go through the lab notes. 
  - Maybe I missed something. 
  - Yeah. 
  Hey, I got to run. 
  - [CELLPHONE CHIMES] 
  - Jared's got a lead that might get us to Paul's wife. 
  And I got a lead on Powell. 
  What do you want from him? 
  The Major, the Holy Grail. 
  Where to begin? 
  JARED: The last charge on Helen's credit card was an Uber ride to here. 
  Clerk ID'd her photo. 
  Said she was in room 28. 
  Checked in alone. 
  So not a kidnapping. 
  More like she's hiding. 
  Why? 
  Helen Santino? 
  NYPD. 
  Your husband, Paul, sent us. 
  - Gun! 
  - Oh, God. 
  Please don't kill me. 
  Please don't kill me. 
  I'm sorry. 
  I didn't believe you were cops. 
  I thought Paul sent you to kill me. 
  Why would he want to kill you? 
  He came close a couple times. 
  Before. 
  He was abusive. 
  Not at first. 
  But after we were married, it started. 
  Said if I'd been a better wife, everything would've been easier. 
  And I tried. 
  But I could never be good enough. 
  None of this is your fault. 
  I know that now. 
  Years of therapy, after he was gone. 
  When the plane disappeared. 
  Answered prayers. 
  When I found out the plane was back The Paul you knew wouldn't have been happy. 
  What do you mean "the Paul I knew"? 
  What's going on? 
 
 
 
  Something happened. 
  Paul lost his memory. 
  So he's not coming? 
  You won't tell him where I am? 
  Helen, it's over. 
  You're safe. 
  Okay? 
  When I got the news about 828, I thought I'd never be happy again. 
  Paul coming back was like this wrecking ball smashing into everything I'd built. 
  [SOBS] 
  [INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS] 
  Hate to ruin your party of one. 
  Get the hell out of here, Stone. 
  I get it you blame me for Vance's death. 
  But I didn't get your boss killed. 
  Give me five minutes, and you'll know who did. 
  One minute. 
  The Major. 
  That supposed to mean something to me? 
  It's who Vance thought he was up against. 
  She's the head of a covert military operation, one that's circumventing the intelligence community. 
  Deep pockets, no accountability. 
  You're not helping your case, Stone. 
  I thought you said you had a name. 
  I don't. 
  But you can get one. 
  Trace a Black Hawk, based out of D. C. 
  Flew into Red Hook an hour before the explosion. 
  The Major, whoever she is, was on board. 
  And she was looking for something she calls the Holy Grail. 
  I need to understand all this, Powell. 
  It affects the safety of all the passengers, of my family. 
  Please help me. 
  Your one minute's up. 
  Whatever you're into, I want no part of it. 
  If you're smart, you'll walk away, too. 
  No. 
  Vance didn't. 
  He believed that no one is above the law. 
  He wanted to help me expose the truth, wherever it led. 
  Like I said you got him killed. 
  No, not me. 
  The Major. 
  And you have a chance to ID her. 
  [SIGHS] 
  Ask yourself what would Vance want you to do? 
  [TELEPHONES RINGING, INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS] 
  Hey! 
  Hey, what's up with you? 
  I don't want to talk about it. 
  Clearly. 
  You didn't say a word to me the whole way back. 
  What's going on? 
  Why didn't you come to the hangar when the plane came back? 
  I'll tell you why because I am a giant wrecking ball smashing into your life. 
  - Mick. 
  - Let's not sugarcoat this, Jay. 
  We owe each other that. 
  I'm gonna tell the Captain that I don't want to work with you anymore. 
  - What? 
  No. 
  - You found happiness, Jared. 
  You deserve it. 
  I am not blowing that up. 
  [INDISTINCT TALKING] 
  MAN: Hey. 
  He's one of them! 
  It's Adrian. 
  Excuse me. 
  Can we touch you? 
  Please. 
  [DOOR OPENS] 
  Trust me this is gonna work. 
  I totally killed cooking dinner. 
  I don't think that the quality of the food is gonna be the issue. 
  Please, me following in her culinary footsteps is just the warm-up. 
  Tonight is gonna be something that everybody needs. 
  - [FOOTSTEPS DESCENDING] 
  - Did I hear the doorbell? 
  Hi. 
  Danny. 
  Um this is not a good time. 
  No, no. 
  It's all good, okay? 
  I invited him over. 
  Just for dinner. 
  I made meatloaf. 
  Olive. 
  Grace, she's worried about you. 
  I am too. 
  No. 
  We're not having this conversation. 
  Not now. 
  Not in front of her. 
  I think you should go. 
  - I don't want him to go. 
  - Olive, this is a family matter. 
  What the hell, Mom?! 
  Danny is family! 
  - [DOOR SLAMS] 
  - Olive! 
  [CLICKING] 
  - Did you find her? 
  - Yeah. 
  Where is she? 
  Can I see her? 
  No. 
  You can't. 
  I don't understand. 
  You know, I thought we were the same, you and me. 
  Coming back, being alone. 
  I felt sorry for you, for me. 
  But we are not the victims. 
  We do not get to come crashing into their lives, wrecking their happiness. 
  What? 
  Why would Why would I - You seriously don't remember, Paul? 
  - Mick. 
  What's wrong? 
  Or maybe you don't want to remember what a monster you are. 
  - You beat your wife. 
  - No. 
  - Michaela. 
  - You're wrong. 
  I would ne - I just want my life back. 
  - Stop saying that! 
  - You do not deserve it! 
  - No, Michaela, stop! 
  You do not deserve a damn thing! 
  Stop it! 
  Geez. 
  [DOOR OPENS] 
  Hey. 
  I got your text. 
  What's wrong? 
  GRACE: You are not a grown-up, Olive. 
  - Mom and Olive?' - OLIVE: You're not acting like one. 
  Olive, you can't talk to your mother like that. 
  Hey. 
  What are you doing here? 
  I-I was invited. 
  Really? 
  'Cause it doesn't look like a happy reunion. 
  - Ben, it's fine. 
  - It's not. 
  I am not dead anymore. 
  I am right here. 
  And why does he get to be in my house with my children? 
  You are the whole reason this family is messed up. 
  I'm trying to pick up the pieces. 
  - Ben! 
  - Stop! 
  All right? 
  I invited him! 
  It's my fault. 
  No, no, this is not your fault. 
  This is not your fault. 
  From the moment that plane landed, you wanted to walk back into this family like no time had passed. 
  And I get that, because for you, it hadn't. 
  And you wanted the family that we had built. 
  And I don't know what I want. 
  But no matter what I do, I'm the bad guy, and I'm tired of it. 
  So we're not doing this. 
  I understand. 
  I-I'll leave. 
  No, no, no. 
  I'll I'm sorry. 
  I never really understood until now. 
  I only thought about how much you got back, not not what you lost. 
  Olive wants you here. 
  No. 
  Dad. 
  It's okay, Ollie. 
  I'm okay. 
  You know you're safe here, buddy, right? 
  Come here. 
  I love you guys so much. 
  Okay. 
  I'll see you tomorrow. 
  Promise. 
  [DOOR OPENS] 
  [EXHALES SHARPLY] 
  [KNOCK ON DOOR] 
  Jared, no. 
  You shouldn't be here right now. 
  Stop. 
  Stop telling me what to do. 
  Or how I'm supposed to feel, Mick. 
  Look, you asked me why I didn't go to the hangar. 
  I didn't go because I knew if I saw you, I would've never gone home. 
  Mick, you're not a wrecking ball. 
  You're my soul mate. 
  No, Jared, I'm not. 
  Yes, you are. 
  I still wake up expecting to find you next to me. 
  Mick, I still look at you, and the rest of the world just goes away. 
  I love you. 
  It's always been you. 
  I didn't cheat death to live a half a life. 
  Neither did you. 
  [CELLPHONE RINGING, VIBRATING] 
  Ugh. 
  [SNIFFLING] 
  - Yeah? 
  - I found the Black Hawk. 
  It went wheels up at Langley 10 minutes ago on red alert. 
  It's a VIP transpo, assigned for someone's personal use. 
  It's got to be the Major. 
  - You get a name? 
  - Classified. 
  If they were at Red Hook, they're likely behind the explosion that killed my boss. 
  You asked me what Vance would do. 
  He'd want me to help you. 
  Thank you. 
  Just watch your six. 
  The Black Hawk filed a flight plan New York City. 
  Whoever the Major is, she's comin'. 
  [CELLPHONE CHIMES] 
  BEN: I don't know her name. 
  But she knows me and my family. 
  And it looks like she's after us. 
  All we did was get on a plane. 
  And because of that, our lives have never been the same. 
  Everyone on that flight got a second chance. 
  But it came at a high price. 
  And now there's a new danger facing us. 
  I don't know what Holy Grail the Major is closing in on. 
  But I do know this I will not let my family be collateral damage in her quest. 
  [KEY CLACKS] 
  The way you worked in the tag brilliant. 
  My subscribers are gonna go through the roof. 
  You can't release it. 
  Are you crazy? 
  We've got to go after the Major. 
  Figure out who she is, who she's working for. 
  Prove the government is lying to us. 
  This is a huge scoop. 
  People need to know. 
  Do it, follow the trail. 
  It just can't go public. 
  Yet. 
  Then why did you come to me? 
  I'm your insurance policy. 
  If this ends badly, blow the lid. 
  And if it doesn't end badly? 
  Then you've got a Deep Throat. 
  Be patient. 
  Who knows how high this all goes. 
  [DOOR OPENS AND CLOSES] 
  Danny You don't need to say anything. 
  If you're ready, when you're ready next week, next month, next year just say the word. 
  Then we should move the people to a-a nursing home - under false names. 
  - No. 
  Paul's awakening gave us an insight into their catatonia. 
  They were harmed in service of my theories. 
  Now we may be close to a cure. 
  I will not abandon them when there's still hope. 
  Then we need to find a way to keep you all safe. 
  [WIND HOWLING] 
  [WHISPERING] 
  Find her. 
  Find her. 
  Find her. 
  [HIGH-PITCHED BUZZING] 
  - Hey. 
  - [GROANS] 
  The calling again? 
  "Find her"? 
  You found Helen. 
  Now it must be telling you to find the Major. 
  I don't think we're supposed to find anyone. 
  I think I'm having someone else's calling. 
  What do you mean? 
  The voice in my head. 
  It's not mine. 
  What the hell's going on? 
  [CAR DOOR CLOSES] 
  [CAR ALARM CHIRPS] 
  [VEHICLE APPROACHES, TIRES SCREECH] 
  [MANSIONAIR'S "EASIER" PLAYS] 
  Face up, untouched Gazing at the ceiling Game's up Never bring you down Face up, I'll lose Craving for some feeling Game's up - We're nowhere to be found - Here you go. 
  [INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS] 
  I'm stuck Um, can I squeeze by? 
  Autumn. 
  What a lovely name. 
  Your name. 
  It's on the cup. 
  Sorry. 
  I didn't mean to freak on you. 
  It's just been a weird day. 
  I understand. 
  And I think perhaps you lost your phone? 
  No, that's not mine. 
  It is now. 
  The Major would like a word. 
  I think I found the Major's Holy Grail. 
  What? 
  What is it? 
  No, it's not a what. 
  It's a who. 
  These failed experiments weren't all a complete failure. 
  The trial was tracking relative success. 
  They found that some of the passengers are more sensitive to the callings. 
  Cal. 
  If the Major finds out what he can do We got to make sure she never does. 
  [WHISPERING] 
  Find her.
