 What about Kelly Taylor? 
 Did you kill her, Isaiah? 
 I would sooner kill myself. 
 Then tell me what happened. 
 I heard the sound of a gun, and I went to her. 
 I-I ran to her. 
 She died in my arms. 
 Then you what, stole her necklace? 
 I don't care about her earthly possessions.

 Trust me, I am far from pure. 
 Because you haven't unburdened yourself, for there is nothing hidden that will not be disclosed, nothing concealed that will not be illuminated. 
 What have you concealed, Michaela, even from yourself?

It's just a little bit out there. Okay, we're listening. So, the marker in mine and Cal's blood could be a sign of ischemia. It occurs when the circulation is limited, but the potency of this marker is on par with a stroke victim. So you think we all had strokes? No, not exactly. If we were taken close to death... extremely close and then brought back... if the faucet of blood circulation has been turned off and then suddenly it was turned on high, that's what it would look like. Interesting theory. How do we know for sure? Right, so my thinking was if I had some brain tissue, I could test for that rebound. If they take a sample during an autopsy, maybe I could have some access. You're thinking of Kelly Taylor. So, I logged into the M.E.'s database. These are all the bodies that have been registered in the Long Island morgue in the last    hours. There is no Kelly Taylor. I've looked everywhere. She's not in the system.
