 Previously on Manifest. 
  I think something bad is gonna happen. 
  - Marko? 
  - To him and me. 
  What are you doing here, Vance? 
  We need each other. 
  - We do this in two steps. 
  - Right. 
  Plant the bug. 
  And, uh, then we give them a little nudge. 
  Somebody did a search, network-wide. 
  "Experiments" and "Flight 828. 
  " It worked. 
  We've already moved them to Brooklyn all 11, to the clean room. 
  Harvey, I'm a cop, and I was on the plane with you. 
  It has to stop. 
  Harvey, no! 
  No! 
  He told people about his callings. 
  Two of those people died. 
  I told Grace. 
  You told Jared. 
  - You left me alone. 
  - I'm sorry. 
  You can't ever do that again. 
  That's an incredibly powerful weapon for the military, for intelligence. 
  This time, he might not survive. 
  It was awful. 
  The whole plane was shaking. 
  It felt like we were gonna crash. 
  The emergency path lights came on, and then we landed. 
  It makes no sense. 
  We'll have to run some tests, to clear you to leave. 
  My son has leukaemia. 
  He's not about to submit to testing of any kind. 
  I need to make a call, okay? 
  I need I need to call my boy my fiancÃ©. 
  We're releasing everyone tomorrow. 
  We need the name of the person or persons you want to authorize to pick you up. 
  uh, I don't really have anyone. 
  I'm kind of between "persons" right now. 
  I'll just get a cab or something. 
  Well, actually, Ms. 
  Cox, it seems you have several outstanding warrants for your arrest. 
  She's all yours. 
  No, y-you don't understand. 
  I didn't do any of those things! 
  Wait! 
  Please let me explain! 
  The detainees are likely being held in this warehouse, built before the Civil War, used for storage. 
  Perimeter has some security, but I - Why are you leaving? 
  - No, why aren't you leaving? 
  We have an address. 
  We know where the missing passengers are. 
  - We have to get them - Whoa. 
  You people rushed in there at the farm, and the detainees were disappeared. 
  May I suggest we take a beat to do this the right way? 
  Starting with Laurence Belson, face of the Singularity Project. 
  We have an office address, e-mail that's it. 
  We need more. 
  I'll go into work, see what I can dig up. 
  Hey. 
  Take this burner. 
  Let me know what you find. 
  What can I do? 
  It's Saturday. 
  Go home. 
  Be with your family. 
  Anything comes up, I'll contact you on your burner. 
  - What, so I'm supposed to just wait? 
  - Yes. 
  Those experiments can start up at any moment. 
  You are a piece of work. 
  It is my job to make sure this mission is successful. 
  I assure you I will go in the second I can do it cleanly without tipping them off that we're coming again and without loss of life. 
  This is top secret, got it? 
  - Got it. 
  - Are you sure? 
  Because this is very serious business, - and I'm counting on you. 
  - Got it. 
  What are you two whispering about? 
  Well your dad's been working so hard, and he hasn't really caught up with his friends since he's been back, so I decided to throw him a last-minute surprise backyard barbecue today. 
  And you and I have to keep Dad out of the house until 4:30. 
  Ah. 
  Sneaky. 
  I like it. 
  Yeah? 
  Hi! 
  You were out early. 
  I had to get a new phone. 
  I dropped mine. 
  Same number, no bigs. 
  So, uh, Dad, Cal wants to go laser tagging this afternoon. 
  Can you take us? 
  Yeah. 
  Yeah, but I'm playing. 
  What's up? 
  Uh, it's work looking for me. 
  Oh, no. 
  Don't tell me they're gonna make you come in on the weekend. 
  Not if I don't answer. 
  I like your style. 
  All right. 
  I got errands. 
  Kids, please take it easy on your old dad. 
  Hey! 
  All right, so, let's head out in a bit. 
  We have to be back around, like, 4:30. 
  Avery's picking me up. 
  Yeah, that should give me plenty of time to defeat you two. 
  You gonna go shoot some hoops? 
  Tryouts on Monday. 
  - I thought maybe I'd - Cal, why didn't you tell me? 
  I could've been warming you up all week. 
  You haven't been around much. 
  Well, I-I'm here now. 
  - Ah. 
  - Closer. 
  Caught some backboard. 
  You know that's not the point of the game, right, Dad? 
  Don't be so hard on yourself. 
  Some of the other kids trying out for the league have been playing for years. 
  Well, you've been a little busy. 
  Traveling through space and time, kicking cancer's butt. 
  Let's go. 
  - Oh! 
  - Yes! 
  LeBron better watch his back. 
  Hey, buddy, wanna take a break? 
  - Can I have screen time? 
  - Yeah, sure. 
  Ben Stone? 
  Please help me. 
  Thank you. 
  I'm My name is Autumn. 
  Autumn Cox. 
  From the plane, right? 
  How did you find me? 
  I heard your name. 
  Like my own voice in my head. 
  And somehow I knew instinctively how to get here. 
  Is that crazy? 
  No, actually. 
  It was like my subconscious was telling me that you could help. 
  Here. 
  Maybe I can. 
  Can you tell me what happened to you and the others? 
  They kept us hooked up to monitors, took samples of our blood. 
  They ran all kinds of tests on us. 
  Autumn, who are "they"? 
  I don't know. 
  We were drugged most of the time. 
  I finally managed to spit my pills out and escape when they brought us somewhere in a van. 
  Do you know where the others are? 
  I-I tried to remember everything I could. 
  Um, there is a long road. 
  And it's rural. 
  There's no car noises. 
  And it smelled like fertilizer. 
  And a red door. 
  I remember that. 
  The dairy farm. 
  I think I could find my way back. 
  We already have. 
  It was empty. 
  Autumn, you said you escaped from a van. 
  Do you know where it was going? 
  No. 
  Oh, God. 
  I'm sorry. 
  I'm so sorry. 
  No. 
  It's okay. 
  We just need to get you some help. 
  Who are you calling? 
  - My sister. 
  She's a cop. 
  - No! 
  No! 
  There were warrants out for my arrest when I got off the plane, but the police who took me from the hangar were the ones who turned me over to them. 
  No, it's okay. 
  Michaela's one of us, a passenger, and so is the doctor I want you to see. 
  I promise you it's okay. 
  We're all in this together. 
  You're safe now. 
  - Hey. 
  Good timing. 
  - I've got the warehouse plans. 
  And I've got a missing passenger. 
  In my garage. 
  What? 
  Autumn Cox. 
  The one the prison system misplaced. 
  Ben, you got to get her out of there. 
  What if Laurence Belson comes looking for Take her to the boiler room. 
  Yeah, good call. 
  I'll have Saanvi and Fiona meet me there. 
  Okay. 
  Keep me posted. 
  Bad stuff is about to happen. 
  I'm the commander now. 
  Uh, guys, I hate to do this, but something came up with work after all. 
  I'm gonna have to postpone laser tag. 
  But you'll be home by 4:30, right? 
  Yeah, Avery wants you to see his new car when he comes to pick me up. 
  I'll do my best. 
  You gotta, Dad! 
  Okay. 
  4:30. 
  I love you guys. 
  - Love you, too, Dad. 
  - Same. 
  Stop. 
  Hey. 
  What are you hiding from me now? 
  Uh, nothing. 
  You'd tell me if someone else who heard the callings drops dead, right? 
  That's not funny, Jared. 
  I know, Mick. 
  And if you're in danger, you have to tell me, no matter what. 
  Okay, look, I'll take that risk. 
  I don't care. 
  I do, okay? 
  I do care. 
  My God. 
  How awful. 
  Hello, Autumn. 
  I'm Fiona. 
  I'm really sorry for everything you've been through, and I assure you we're going to help the others. 
  We should get her some rest. 
  Are those burn marks part of your research protocol? 
  Electrotherapy. 
  To activate mirror neurons in the premotor cortex. 
  - Meaning? 
  - Meaning that they need to get at something inside their heads, but i-instead of picking the lock, they are using dynamite to blast the door down. 
  You had no idea what you were doing. 
  - Oh, my God. 
  - Your research is wildly unethical. 
  It was theoretical. 
  A way to increase human connection. 
  I never intended for it to be used this way. 
  Then you shouldn't have handed over your research. 
  Neuroscience is an arms race. 
  The government doesn't care about who gets hurt as long as they get results. 
  Not the whole government. 
  Vance. 
  This is the proof he's been waiting for. 
  - We should bring him in. 
  - No! 
  He put Bethany in jail. 
  If Autumn has a warrant out for her arrest, he'll do the same. 
  Do you really want him knowing about this place? 
  We need his help. 
  Vance risked his career by trusting me. 
  It's time for us to trust him. 
  It's okay. 
  I don't want to go to jail, but you haven't seen what they're doing to us. 
  I'll do whatever I have to. 
  My God. 
  Laurence Belson and his people are using massive electrical currents to do experiments on their brains. 
  Well, I understand interrogating them, but Experimenting on them? 
  Why? 
  No, there's something here that doesn't add up, and I am not making a move until I figure out what it is. 
  Something happened on that plane. 
  And some of the passengers know things that no one else knows. 
  You're gonna have to be a hell of a lot more specific. 
  I can't, because I don't understand it myself, but we receive messages. 
  Impulses. 
  It's why we gathered before the plane blew up. 
  How we found the Pyler sisters, exonerated Radd's son. 
  It's how Autumn found me. 
  How much does Laurence Belson know about this telepathy or whatever it is? 
  The first few days, they just questioned us about the plane. 
  And then some of us got this vision. 
  We just knew we had to go to the plane, but they wouldn't let us. 
  The next day, they told us the plane had exploded. 
  And then everything changed. 
  They started these experiments. 
  They called them treatments. 
  Twice a day. 
  And every day, they got more intense. 
  Are you satisfied? 
  We have to go, now. 
  Let Let me just wrap - my head around this. 
  - Jesus, Vance! 
  Then stick your bureaucratic head back in the ground and pretend it's not happening, because I am going in now, even if you're not! 
  These people are heavily armed. 
  - Why take that kind of risk? 
  - Because my son my My son is channeling the pain from one of the missing passengers. 
  How is that even possible? 
  How is any of this possible? 
  As soon as the experiments start, Cal will feel that torture. 
  There is nothing I won't do to protect my son. 
  We have to go, now! 
  We're ready, sir. 
  Oh, no. 
  - Is everyone on? 
  - We're here. 
  You're able to see all the subjects? 
  We can see. 
  - The Major says proceed. 
  - Copy that. 
  Okay, as you can see, we are Officially up and running again and are now commencing Phase Two of the Mirror Factor test protocol. 
  If everyone's set, I'll pass it over to you, Doctor. 
  We had mild but noticeable sympathetic responses among some of the subjects with our initial testing on Subject 3, so we'll now adjust up to a base line of 40% on Subject 3 only. 
  FEMALE COMPUTERIZED VOICE: Subject 3 only. 
  Marked pain response in Subjects 4 and 7, yet only Subject 3 is receiving stimulation. 
  Adjust down base line to zero. 
  These are our most significant results yet. 
  But only two others responded. 
  That appears to be correct. 
  Can we try again with an increased charge? 
  Double it, please. 
  Our normal protocol is a six-hour downtime per charge. 
  We don't know how sequential testing cou Let's try. 
  Go ahead. 
  80%. 
  Aah! 
  Ohh! 
  What the hell?! 
  They've started up again! 
  What the hell was that?! 
  Was that what you felt at the lab? 
  If we felt it, I can only imagine what my son felt. 
  - Hi, Dad. 
  Are you on your w - Is, uh, Cal okay? 
  Yeah, and so am I. 
  Can you check on Cal? 
  Sure. 
  Cal, are you okay? 
  I-I'm fine! 
  - He's fine. 
  Can you make sure, please? 
  Do you mind? 
  I'm busy. 
  He's totally fine. 
  Rude, but fine. 
  Is Cal okay? 
  For now. 
  Enough proof? 
  I will assemble a tactical team. 
  Good. 
  I'll meet you on site. 
  No, not you. 
  Look. 
  I was military, but I am gonna be standing behind a tactical unit. 
  There's no way I'm bringing in civilians. 
  No, no, if I'm not there, how will you know if the mission is affecting us, affecting my son? 
  I'm not gonna get in the way, but I'm coming. 
  So am I. 
  If they're using my research, you're gonna need me. 
  I'll meet you in ninety minutes. 
  Turn off your cellphones. 
  Leave them here. 
  All communications is through the burners I gave you. 
  They cannot know we're coming. 
  I'll text you the rendezvous point. 
  So make sure you give it a really good toss 'cause the olive oil's kind of settling on the bottom there. 
  Okay. 
  Oh, I will get the door. 
  Please call Dad and make sure he's getting home from work. 
  Yes. 
  Your dad. 
  Cal! 
  People are here! 
  Please come down! 
  You've reached Ben Stone. 
  Please leave a message. 
  Hey, babe. 
  Are you on your way home? 
  Call me. 
  Hey! 
  - Hey! 
  Hi! 
  - Oh, how's it going? 
  Hey. 
  You okay? 
  Yeah, it was nothing. 
  It was just a headache. 
  That wasn't just a headache, Mick. 
  Let me help you. 
  It's not your fight, Jared. 
  Where did you get that? 
  NSA guy. 
  Vance. 
  Vance, the guy who wanted me to spy on you. 
  - He's on our side now. 
  - So he says. 
  No, he's risking everything to help us. 
  - He's calling in a team. 
  - So where do we meet him? 
  If that guy's gonna be there, you better believe I'm coming with you. 
  I'll tell Vance you're joining. 
  Warehouse in Red Hook. 
  And next time I see your mom, remind me to ask her why her son is so damn stubborn. 
  Ben better get here soon. 
  These last few beers aren't gonna drink themselves. 
  I'm gonna get these burgers on. 
  Grace, do you have any napkins? 
  Uh, yes. 
  Just give me one sec. 
  You've reached Ben Stone. 
  Please leave a message. 
  Ben, this is the third message I've left you. 
  I'm starting to get worried. 
  Can you please just let me know you're all right? 
  Mom! 
  Mom! 
  They need to talk to Dad. 
  Is Ben Stone here? 
  No. 
  I'm sorry. 
  He's at work. 
  I assure you, ma'am, he's not. 
  His employment was terminated as of 8:00 p. m. yesterday evening. 
  What? 
  No, that's impossible. 
  Why? 
  We really can't discuss the details of the termination, but it is imperative that we talk to Mr. 
  Stone or his attorney as soon as possible. 
  His attorney? 
  And I'm afraid we need to collect his I. D. badge. 
  Go. 
  - Clear! 
  - All clear! 
  - No one here, sir! 
  - All clear! 
  - They're gone. 
  All of them. 
  - What the hell? 
  - stand down. 
  All clear. 
  - No sign of anyone! 
  Building's secure! 
  Cal? 
  Cal, Mom Mom needs us right now. 
  Cal. 
  No. 
  No, no, no. 
  T-The missing passengers were here. 
  All the data pointed to this location. 
  The property records, the cellphone pings Ben, we looked everywhere. 
  They're not here. 
  Maybe somebody tipped them of. 
  Well, maybe, they did. 
  You know, these people are smart, but one false - Stop, everyone. 
  - This is getting us nowhere. 
  We have to find these people. 
  - Where do we look? 
  - We have no idea where they went. 
  Dad! 
  They're still here. 
  Cal, what are you doing here, where's Mom? 
  I had to come. 
  I left a note. 
  No, you cannot be here. 
  This is crazy. 
  - How did you even - I took a bus. 
  No one knows where we are right now. 
  I knew. 
  It's like the subway tunnels, Dad. 
  Oh, my God. 
  Cal, you're burning up. 
  No, Dad. 
  You don't understand. 
  I'm supposed to help you find them. 
  They're right here. 
  Cal, we turned the warehouse upside down. 
  They're not in there. 
  They're right here! 
  Check between those trees. 
  Seriously? 
  I followed a headache I may as well follow a crayon drawing. 
  Come on. 
  We got to get you home. 
  No. 
  You have to help them. 
  There's a whole team here, Cal. 
  Come on. 
  They found something! 
  You have to go, Dad. 
  You're the only one that can see them! 
  Ben, it's a calling. 
  "Who can see them"? 
  What do you mean, buddy? 
  I don't know. 
  All I know is that you have to go! 
  Go. 
  I'll take him home. 
  No, I'm waiting for Dad. 
  Hurry! 
  I'll keep him safe in the car. 
  Come on. 
  Come on. 
  Let's go! 
  Keep him safe! 
  Call Grace! 
  Thanks. 
  Mom, where's Dad? 
  Honey, I don't want you to worry about your dad. 
  I don't care what those people say. 
  No, Mom, I'm not worried about Dad, okay? 
  I'm worried about Cal. 
  He's gone. 
  Oh, my God. 
  What is this place? 
  Definitely wasn't on any map, but it looks like an old coal cellar. 
  There's a whole system of tunnels down here. 
  Vance! 
  I told you two to hang back. 
  This is dangerous. 
 
 
 
  - I don't - Hey. 
  NSA, drop your weapon! 
  Drop it! 
  Get the files! 
  Everything you can carry! 
  Erasure protocol! 
  Neutralize. 
  Do it! 
  We can't leave any evidence behind! 
  My God. 
  - Spread out! 
  - Move, move, move! 
  Make it stop, please! 
  We got to get them out of here now! 
  Freeze! 
  You okay? 
  Detach the leads! 
  Belson! 
  Stop! 
  You're way out of your depth, Director. 
  Who you working for? 
  Who has the funding to get all this up and running and keep it all under wraps? 
  You clearly have no idea who you're interfering with. 
  Neither do you. 
  This way! 
  Follow me! 
  Which way? 
  Lights. 
  Follow Follow the lights. 
  - To the right. 
  - What lights? 
  You don't see path lights? 
  No. 
  Oh, my God. 
  Cal said you'd be the only one to see them. 
  He meant the lights. 
  - Let's go. 
  - Yeah. 
  I think we're going in circles. 
  Which way? 
  Let's try the left. 
  - You getting in? 
  - No, I can't. 
  I found a remote property. 
  I'm going to take them there. 
  They'll be safe with me. 
  - Be careful. 
  - Yeah. 
  We're clear. 
  You okay? 
  Where's Jared and Vance? 
  They went to get Laurence with a couple of Vance's guys. 
  Take Cal home. 
  I'm gonna go check. 
  Okay. 
  Come on. 
  - Jared! 
  - Mick! 
  Cal. 
  Cal. 
  Cal! 
  Cal. 
  Cal! 
  Cal! 
  Cal. 
  Are you okay? 
  I'm fine, Dad Mick! 
  Mick. 
  There's tunnels under the whole area. 
  It's unstable. 
  Come on. 
  Okay? 
  Hey. 
  We got to go, okay? 
  We got to go! 
  Come on. 
  No. 
  Take Cal and go. 
  It's unsafe! 
  Mick, get in the car! 
  Jared's still down there, Ben! 
  Jared is still down there! 
  I'm not leaving him! 
  Just take Cal! 
  Go! 
  Go! 
  Jared! 
  Jared! 
  No, no. 
  Come on. 
  Come on, Jared. 
  Come on. 
  Oh, my God. 
  Oh, my God. 
  Oh, my God. 
  Come on. 
  Please. 
  Please, please, please, please. 
  Somebody help me! 
  Help me! 
  Jared. 
  Please don't do this. 
  No, no, no, no. 
  Jared. 
  Oh, my God. 
  Cal. 
  Grace, he's okay. 
  You can't do that. 
  You can't leave like that. 
  - He's fine. 
  - He is not fine. 
  Come on. 
  Let's get you cleaned up, okay? 
  - Grace. 
  - Just stay away. 
  Has he come to yet? 
  How the hell did you two get mixed up in an anti-terrorist op? 
  We got an anonymous tip. 
  We didn't know what we were walking into. 
  Some good people lost their lives. 
  I knew one of them. 
  Robert Vance, NSA. 
  No, I saw him getting loaded into the back of an ambulance. 
  He didn't make it. 
  But don't give up hope. 
  He needs you. 
  I don't know who you are or what you are, but I have listened to you. 
  Listen to me, please. 
  I can't lose him. 
  Please, I can't lose him. 
  I can't lose him. 
  I can't lose you. 
  I can't lose him. 
  Please don't go. 
  Please don't go. 
  Please don't go. 
  I know this all sounds crazy No, not crazy. 
  Horrifying. 
  There were assault weapons and explosions?! 
  - What were you thinking? 
  - I-I didn't bring him, Grace. 
  I was shocked when he showed up. 
  Then why didn't you bring him home immediately? 
  He could've been killed, Ben. 
  You don't understand. 
  You weren't on the plane. 
  But you have to trust me. 
  Everything I am doing is to protect Cal. 
  After all we went through with his cancer, I can't You can't what? 
  You can't lose him? 
  That's how many days I watched cancer consume my little boy. 
  Eight months. 
  That's how long it took me to file the death certificate after the plane disappeared. 
  1,430. 
  You know what that was? 
  The cost of my son's gravestone. 
  Grace. 
  So please don't ever tell me that I don't understand, because you don't know what it's like to have your child die. 
  You're right. 
  I am sorry. 
  But don't you want me to do whatever it takes to keep our son safe? 
  Is that what you call what happened this afternoon? 
  Keeping him safe? 
  I thought I could just ignore the last five years of my life, that we could just start over right where we left off, because you were the same even if I wasn't. 
  You're not the same. 
  I just I don't know you. 
  And I don't I don't think this is right anymore. 
  You're right. 
  I can't give you what you need right now, what you deserve. 
  I'll go. 
  But I need to take Cal with me. 
  How could you even suggest that? 
  I am the only one who can keep him safe right now. 
  I mourned my son for five years. 
  I will never, never let anyone take him away from me, not ever again. 
  You should go. 
  Jared. 
  Jared. 
  Ugh. 
  Thank you, thank you, thank you. 
  - Hi. 
  - Hi. 
  Hi. 
  Hi. 
  Lourdes is on her way. 
  I'll go I'll go get her. 
  No, no, please. 
  Stay with me. 
  Okay. 
  Thought I might find you here. 
  Nowhere else to go. 
  We'll find a place. 
  It's awful about Vance. 
  You know, I read something online. 
  It said his friends called him "Bobby. 
  " Bobby. 
  That does not suit him at all. 
  It sounds like Jared's through the woods, though, right? 
  I don't know. 
  He knows about the calling, so You don't still believe that telling people about the callings is getting them killed? 
  You told Vance, and There was an explosion. 
  It was an accident. 
  And Vance wasn't the only one that knew about the callings down there. 
  Jared did, too. 
  He didn't die. 
  It's because Because what? 
  The callings talk to us, Ben. 
  This time, I talked back. 
  I asked the callings to save Jared. 
  How can you think, after everything that's happened, that we have any control whatsoever over this thing? 
  It worked. 
  Jared's gonna be okay, and that wasn't at all certain last night. 
  People get better, Mick, through no magic, no prayer or whatever you want to call it, no callings. 
  They just get better. 
  You can deny it all you want, Ben, but don't forget that you told Grace, and if she had been the one in the ICU, you would've been on your knees just like I was. 
  I'm so sorry about your friend Vance. 
  I never should've come here. 
  None of this is your fault. 
  Everything you've done to help so far has brought the whole thing to an end. 
  I have to go to work. 
  You gonna be okay? 
  I'll be fine. 
  Thank you. 
  You guys saved my life. 
  We saw the lab, what you went through. 
  But it's gone. 
  You're safe. 
  You're one of us. 
  Are you okay? 
  Are you hungry? 
  We'll get you something. 
  You guys are gonna get so sick of me saying this but Thank you. 
  Just get him to trust you. 
  Be specific, but nothing useful. 
  According to your criminal record, this is your thing, right? 
  Find out why he's looking into us, what he knows, and who he's working with. 
  Is that perfectly clear? 
  Yeah. 
  I got it. 
  Hey, buddy, wanna take a break? 
  - Can I have screen time? 
  - Yeah, sure.
