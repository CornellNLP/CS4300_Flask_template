 Previously on 'Manifest'. 
  His fingerprints were found on the airplane? 
  Inside the cargo hatch door, they were fresh when the plane landed. 
  There was a stowaway on 828. 
  I want you to go on out to the landing gear and jump down. 
  - And then what? 
  - And then you run. 
  Olive is an amazing young woman. 
  You've done an incredible job. 
  It doesn't matter where you found the strength. 
  Save him. 
  - Olive Stone? 
  - Yeah. 
  I'm afraid we caught her shoplifting. 
  - We need to go in. 
  - Are you crazy? 
  You need to trust me, okay? 
  But I thought her dad was already here. 
  There they are. 
  Hi. 
  I'm Danny. 
  - NYPD! 
  - Everybody down on the floor! 
  Who made the call? 
  I did. 
  You don't have to take the fall to protect me, Jared. 
  That is the last thing that I want. 
  Then tell me what's really going on. 
  - More water? 
  - No, thank you. 
  - Can I get you anything? 
  - I'm fine. 
  What about you, sir? 
  Could I get a I'll be right back. 
  See anything interesting? 
  No New York yet. 
  This is the longest I've ever been away from Cal. 
  Well, Olive, being a twin is a heck of a special relationship. 
  You always feel connected, no matter where you are. 
  - Did the trip work? 
  - I don't know what you're Please. 
  I can spot a marital repair job a mile away. 
  Oh. 
  Ben and I are fine. 
  I know my son. 
  You two haven't been having many good times lately. 
  We're too focused on Cal. 
  Getting away from the hospital helped. 
  Maybe we're turning a corner. 
  I want to wait for Cal and Daddy. 
  Oh, no, honey. 
  Let's go home. 
  We'll get unpacked first. 
  Honey, you know, I got all kinds of baseball to catch up on. 
  - He's got his baseball. 
  - I know you miss your brother, but he'll be here before you know it. 
  Please, Grandma? 
  I'm gonna show you something. 
  All righty, Ollie Bollie. 
  Flight 828 there. 
  You see? 
  It's not gonna arrive for another few hours. 
  It's too long to wait. 
  "See Agent"? 
  What's that mean? 
  That's just airline talk, honey. 
  For passengers on Montego Air Flight 828, please see an agent. 
  - I know it's gonna be bad news. 
  - Jared, stop. 
  I should have never proposed so soon after the accident. 
  I mean, she's not ready. 
  Now she's gonna get off that plane and turn me down. 
  No. 
  She's gonna get off that plane and say yes. 
  - Are you sure? 
  - Please. 
  We've been friends since forever. 
  I'm so totally psychic. 
  Michaela am I right? 
  No, it's Grace. 
  Hello? 
  W-What's wrong? 
  Excuse me. 
  NYPD, coming through. 
  Thank you. 
  - Not both of them. 
  - They're They're They're gonna - Dear God, not both my babies. 
  - They're gonna find them, Kar. 
  - What's going on? 
  - Grace is over there, looking for answers. 
  Maybe your badge will help. 
  Our Father who art in heaven. 
  Hallowed be thy name. 
  Thy Kingdom come, thy will be done There's a search operation in progress. 
  Now, that's the official answer. 
  Tell us what's really going on. 
  That's all the information I have at this time. 
  - We're doing all we can. 
  - But what are you doing? 
  Who's looking for my family? 
  Ma'am, y-you need to calm down. 
  - The hell I do! 
  - My family's on that plane. 
  Olive shouldn't be hearing this. 
  Hey, O! 
  How was Jamaica? 
  Come tell Auntie Oh, my God. 
  I should have said no. 
  I should have made him stay on our flight. 
  We'd all be together now. 
  Cal would be here now. 
  I thought you said they were bumped. 
  No, they volunteered for $400, and now my son is missing. 
  - Oh, my God. 
  - S-She didn't want to come back? 
  I want my dad! 
  - I want my dad! 
  - I know. 
  This is a huge mess. 
  You're in the U. 
  S. 
  illegally, and Bethany broke what six federal laws smuggling you onto that plane? 
  And proud of it. 
  You think I should have left him there to become a victim of a hate crime in Jamaica? 
  No, but now Vance is searching for him, and your choice has put us all in jeopardy. 
  I am not going to jail and missing another five years with my family. 
  I'm grateful for all your help, but I can't ask you to endanger your families. 
  - I'll leave. 
  - No, no, it's too late. 
  The NSA will find evidence at the hospital linking us to your escape. 
  Besides, I'm supposed to help you. 
  - We all are. 
  - Not all of us. 
  Just me. 
  Like your brother said, this was my choice. 
  I've got a cabin upstate. 
  - We can go - Vance will find you. 
  It's a friend's cabin. 
  He can't trace it to me. 
  Besides, the place is in the middle of nowhere. 
  I just need to grab some supplies and the keys. 
  That sounds great. 
  Good luck. 
  Hey! 
  You can't just blow them off. 
  I know you believe some mystical force is binding us to each other, but these callings are dangerous. 
  - You don't know that. 
  - Really? 
  Jared's career is on the line because you listened to some voice in your head. 
  I misunderstood the message. 
  Or something is screwing with us. 
  I don't believe that. 
  And I will find a way to save Jared's job. 
  Go ahead, sabotage your life, but don't ask me to blow up mine. 
  It's all connected. 
  You just heard something. 
  Hey! 
  Tell me what it said. 
  There's nothing some creepy voice can say that is worth risking my family's safety. 
  I know two kidnapped girls who would disagree. 
  Don't blackmail me, Mick. 
  Grace and the kids come first. 
  I'm going home. 
  You can't just walk away from this. 
  Watch me. 
  Sitrep. 
  Now. 
  John Doe isn't on the manifest, but fingerprints in the cargo hold are conclusive - he was on that plane. 
  - And yet, those fingerprints have so far failed to identify him. 
  We're reaching out to Interpol, casting a wider net. 
  Any intel on how he avoided arrest at the hospital? 
  - Nothing at this time - I want verified information now. 
  Who is he? 
  Where is he? 
  Does he have accomplices? 
  If so, are they passengers? 
  I shouldn't have to tell anyone in this room finding John Doe is a matter of national security. 
  He had help. 
  From a passenger. 
  Bethany Collins. 
  The flight attendant was at the hospital. 
  So was Saanvi Bahl. 
  She works there, could be a coincidence. 
  Not when one of them has access to the cargo hold. 
  I want these women located, interviewed. 
  Now. 
  Let me tell you something as union rep, it's my job to protect your job. 
  CDIU is gonna make someone pay, all right? 
  Could be you, or we just let this giant, stinking turd kind of roll downhill. 
  You want me to blame Detective Stone. 
  T-That's not gonna happen. 
  She says she heard a gunshot. 
  That's good enough for me. 
  Look, you're being G. O. 
  Sixteened. 
  Do you understand? 
  They catch you lying, you get fired. 
  Automatically. 
  And ain't nothin' the union can do except say "sayonara" and wave goodbye to your sorry ass. 
  Thanks for the advice. 
  All right. 
  Don't say I didn't warn ya, huh? 
  Hey. 
  Hey, I thought Riojas benched you. 
  I was worried about you. 
  Is that your delegate? 
  What'd he say? 
  It's gonna be a walk in the park. 
  Go home. 
  Enjoy the day off. 
  - Hey, babe. 
  - Hey. 
  - How was your day? 
  - Good. 
  Uh, Olive's at school already, so Cal will come with me to work. 
  Well, how about I hang out with him? 
  He'll start school soon, so I want to max out all the free time we got left. 
  I thought you were doing rÃ©sumÃ© follow-up. 
  - Done and dusted. 
  - It's just a waiting game now. 
  Well, I'm sure you'll get a lot of great offers. 
  But today, it's all about Cal. 
  Well, get going. 
  And have fun. 
  Dad! 
  "Fortnite" totally rocks. 
  You gotta learn to play. 
  Well, then you gotta teach me It's all connected. 
  Um, Dad? 
  Hey. 
  Do you ever feel like someone else is controlling your life? 
  Only, like, all the time. 
  You, Mom, Grandpa, all of my doctors. 
  And being controlled is no fun, right? 
  So what do you say we try a little chaos theory? 
  - Be unpredictable. 
  - Cool. 
  - How? 
  - We don't make any decisions. 
  We flip a coin, and we leave it to chance. 
  And nobody's in charge. 
  Okay? 
  So, heads we go bowling. 
  Tails, Coney Island. 
  - Sound good? 
  - Sounds great. 
  All right. 
  Here we go. 
  Coney Island! 
  Sweet! 
  - I love the Cyclone! 
  - All right, let's go! 
  Masters of our own destiny. 
  I like the sound of that. 
  Have a great day, guys. 
  We'll see you later. 
  At the six-month anniversary of Flight 828's disappearance, the odds of finding any trace of the doomed flight are slim. 
  No evidence of the plane has ever been recovered. 
  And now the families of 828 face a sad reality they may never recover their loved ones' remains. 
  And now, in other I made you some soup, Mom. 
  Oh, thanks, Ollie Bollie, but I'm not really hungry. 
  You gotta eat. 
  What happened to your hand? 
  I tried to make you ham and cheese, but the knife slipped, and I cut myself, and the blood got on the bread, and we don't have any more bread or even ham, and the cheese has green spots on it. 
  So I just made Cup O' Noodles. 
  I hope you like it, Mom. 
  Pull yourself together. 
  Thanks for helping. 
  I couldn't face being in Mick's apartment alone. 
  Yeah, of course. 
  I can't believe her life boils down to these boxes. 
  Every single one is me and Evie and Michaela. 
  The Three Amigas. 
  And only one left. 
  Do you remember this one? 
  The Summer Carnival at St. 
  Agnes. 
  Evie tripped over Mrs. 
  O'Connell's poodle and fell over. 
  Ah. 
  I wondered who was making such a ruckus. 
  Oh, don't stop on our account. 
  It'd good to hear real laughter again. 
  It feels wrong. 
  Joy is never wrong. 
  I miss them all so much, and I know we'll be together again someday. 
  But right now, I think to myself, what would Michaela want? 
  And I know. 
  She'd want the people she loved the most to be happy. 
  - Here. 
  - No, honey. 
  You two keep them. 
  Remember her and laugh. 
  That way, she'll live forever. 
  When Cal was sick I wanted to make the most of every moment. 
  That's why we were on that damn trip in the first place. 
  Not only did I lose my son, but I lost my husband, too. 
  I felt like I had no one left. 
  But I did have someone left my daughter. 
  And she's what brought me here today. 
  I mean, people say to me, "Grace, you look great. 
  You're so strong. 
  " But I know they're just being polite. 
  I don't know. 
  It's weird, but, sometimes, I just I wish that someone would just say to me, "Gee, Grace, you look like hell. 
  " Well, thanks for sharing, Grace. 
  Gee, Grace. 
  You look like hell. 
  Now, that's the first time insulting a woman ever made her smile. 
  Well, I-I guess I asked for it. 
  - Yeah. 
  - Thank you. 
  I hardly recognize the sound of my own laugh. 
  I'm Grace. 
  Danny. 
  And you're welcome. 
  - Masters! 
  - Masters! 
  What is cotton candy? 
  You know what? 
  That's a very good question. 
  I have no idea. 
  I suck at this. 
  Everybody does. 
  It's impossible. 
  LeBron couldn't even sink a shot. 
  Hey, come on. 
  You wanna master your own destiny? 
  Come on. 
  Way better. 
  It always is during the day. 
  Yeah! 
  Hey! 
  - That one! 
  - Here you go. 
  That's a good one. 
  All right, let's flip for lunch. 
  Heads, Nathan's. 
  Tails, pizza. 
  - Pizza! 
  - Pizza! 
  We go on another ride, I'll yak. 
  You and me both. 
  - Let's go home. 
  - It's all connected. 
  But only if the coin says so. 
  - Yeah. 
  - Go for it. 
  Heads we hit the subway. 
  Tails we stay. 
  Home. 
  F train's right over there. 
  Shouldn't we just take a Lyft? 
  Come on, dad. 
  Keep it random. 
  Now let's go. 
  I hear the train. 
  Surprise. 
  Wow. 
  I'm so happy to see you. 
  I was in the neighborhood, so Yeah, come in. 
  I'm sorry the place is a mess. 
  You want a coffee? 
  No, I'm good. 
  Thank you. 
  That looks like one of the ones my mom would always crochet. 
  Yeah, she made it for me. 
  I'm an idiot. 
  You should have it. 
  No, no, it's okay, really. 
  It's sweet of you to offer. 
  I'm a double idiot. 
  My photos. 
  When we cleaned out your place, I kept them. 
  I can't believe you saved them. 
  Anything for you, Mick. 
  I mean it. 
  Actually, that's why I'm here. 
  I need your help. 
  Jared is taking the fall for something that I did um, a mistake I made. 
  He thinks he's doing the right thing, but it could mess up his whole career. 
  You gotta You gotta tell him to stop. 
  He didn't tell me. 
  I'm sorry. 
  I shouldn't have come. 
  - This was a mistake. 
  - Don't go, please. 
  It's not a mistake. 
  You have a problem, you come to me. 
  The Three Amigas, remember? 
  And there's still three of us. 
  You, me, and and Jared. 
  All for one. 
  So you'll convince him not to take the fall? 
  No, absolutely not. 
  You know he always does the right thing. 
  Please, Lou. 
  Help me save his job. 
  Being a detective that's his dream. 
  I know. 
  I am so sorry I missed your promotion ceremony. 
  Don't hate me. 
  Never. 
  - Cheers. 
  - Cheers. 
  Let me see your bling. 
  I still keep expecting them to take it back, say it was all a mistake. 
  Please. 
  You totally deserve this. 
  You work your ass off. 
  And you basically have no life. 
  Excuse me, but I have a life. 
  - Ahh. 
  - Yeah. 
  - I go to the gym. 
  - Mm-hmm. 
  - I work on my car. 
  I - Yeah, boring. 
  You need adventure. 
  Surfing, sky diving, anything. 
  Get out of your comfort zone. 
  - I don't know. 
  - Coward. 
  That was out of your comfort zone. 
  Yeah, that was crazy. 
  Sorry. 
  Are you? 
  Not at all. 
  Me, either. 
  Mom, I'm not hugging him. 
  Okay, fine. 
  Just please be polite. 
  Danny is my friend. 
  He's not your friend. 
  He's your boyfriend. 
  I'm 12, not an idiot. 
  Guess you better answer that. 
  Yep, guess I better. 
  Olive sounds happy. 
  Sorry. 
  It's my fault. 
  I think two years is still too soon. 
  Stop. 
  It's not your fault. 
  Or hers. 
  Look, I'll go, okay? 
  - We'll try again another time. 
  - No. 
  Uh. 
  It's taken me a long time to be ready for this. 
  But you've been good for me, and I think you would be good for her, too, if she'd let you. 
  So, stay. 
  Please. 
  I made meatloaf. 
  Ahh. 
  Now there's an offer I can't refuse. 
  So, who would like seconds? 
  Mm, well, my trainer would want me to say no, but, uh, I can't. 
  Thanks. 
  So, you don't like your mom's cooking, huh? 
  Want to know a secret? 
  I don't like meatloaf, either. 
  Then why'd you ask for seconds? 
  I'm just being polite. 
  It's kind of customary when people like each other. 
  Tough room. 
  Come on, Olive. 
  Help me figure this out. 
  If you hate meatloaf and I hate meatloaf, then why is your mom making meatloaf? 
  She thinks it's my favorite, but she's wrong. 
  It's not. 
  It's Cal's. 
  Hmm. 
  Oh, sweetie. 
  You must miss your brother so much. 
  He's not dead. 
  He's just lost. 
  And some day, when I grow up, I'm gonna find him. 
  Olive! 
  Come back here. 
  It's all right. 
  Let her go. 
  I'm sorry. 
  Hey, more meatloaf for me. 
  Mm. 
  It's It's really good. 
  It's delicious. 
  So good. 
  It's all connected. 
  Next stop Columbus Circle, 59th Street, 7th Avenue stop. 
  Hey, it's the guy from the airport. 
  Hey, Mr. 
  Flight 828. 
  What's up? 
  - Hey, 828. 
  - Can we get a selfie? 
  Come on, guys. 
  It's my kid here. 
  Hey, hey! 
  Cal, Cal! 
  Buddy. 
  It's not our stop. 
  We're still in Manhattan. 
  It's part of the game, Dad. 
  This way. 
  - Follow me. 
  - Cal! 
  No, Cal, stop! 
  Cal! 
  Cal, wait up! 
  Take the first left. 
  Oh! 
  No, Cal, slow down! 
  Cal, stop! 
  Come on, Dad! 
  Masters of our own destiny! 
  Game over, Cal! 
  We're going home! 
  No way! 
  This is too much fun! 
  Cal, stop! 
  Don't worry, Dad. 
  It's all connected! 
  Cal! 
  Tell me I'm doing the right thing. 
  You're doing the right thing. 
  - Do what you gotta do and hurry back. 
  - Yeah. 
  And take the E-ZPass out of the car. 
  Pay cash for everything. 
  Don't leave a paper trail. 
  Easy, babe. 
  I'll be safe. 
  - See you Monday. 
  - Okay. 
  Bethany Collins, you're under arrest. 
  - What's happening? 
  - What? 
  What happened? 
  - No, wait, I'm sorry what is going on? 
  - What is this about? 
  Cal! 
  Cal, I said stop! 
  No! 
  No, no, no, no, no! 
  Don't open that! 
  Cal! 
  Cal! 
  Cal, wait! 
  Cal! 
  Uh. 
  Hi. 
  I'm Cal. 
  You're Thomas? 
  How did you know his name? 
  I-I didn't. 
  It just came to me. 
  Cal, you you led us here. 
  How did you find out about this place? 
  I don't even know what this place is. 
  I was just being random. 
  But you said, "It's all connected. 
  " Because it is. 
  All the tunnels in the subway, they come together. 
  Okay, okay, but did you hear something in in your head? 
  Like a voice? 
  - A voice? 
  - What are you talking about? 
  Cal, you must have known this place was down here. 
  Hey, easy on the boy, now. 
  You play chess? 
  A little. 
  Not too good. 
  Well, practice, and you'll get better. 
  Set it up. 
 
 
 
  We can play. 
  - Thank you. 
  - I-I didn't mean to snap at him. 
  - I'm just - Blown away? 
  Yeah, that's that's an understatement. 
  Let's talk. 
  One minute we're on the subway. 
  The next minute, I'm chasing Cal, no sense of direction. 
  But somehow, he brought us here. 
  Look. 
  I know you don't want to be involved No, that that was before. 
  Everything's changed now. 
  I thought you were leaving with Bethany. 
  So did I, but Bethany leave and never come back. 
  It's been hours. 
  Oh, aren't you supposed to be at work? 
  Day off. 
  I thought we could eat some pizza and catch up like old times. 
  Come on. 
  I'm sick of sitting out here alone. 
  Oh. 
  What's up, honey? 
  Hmm? 
  I miss Mom, Dad. 
  Yeah. 
  Yeah. 
  Me, too. 
  Most nights, I sit out here just to feel close to her. 
  Well, I appreciate the pepperoni, but what's on your mind, kiddo? 
  Hmm? 
  Today, I saw one of Mom's afghans. 
  Oh she was always making those damn things. 
  I mean, I couldn't sit down without getting a crochet hook in my ass. 
  Mm. 
  It was at Jared and Lourdes' house. 
  Being there was like looking at the life that would have been mine. 
  Ah. 
  You're young. 
  You can still have all that and more. 
  Just not with Jared. 
  In Jamaica, you weren't sure you wanted it. 
  I know, but on the plane, I made the decision I was gonna say yes. 
  You still want to be with him? 
  Of course I do, Dad. 
  How could I not? 
  - Then go get him, sweetie. 
  - He's married. 
  Only because he thought you were gone. 
  I told your mom. 
  - I-I didn't think. 
  - he ever stopped loving you. 
  So what would she tell me to do, then? 
  She'd want you to be happy. 
  I mean, if you love him, tell him. 
  That is crazy advice, Dad. 
  I mean, if I'd been on your plane and come home and found your mother with some other man? 
  I'd have fought like hell to get her back. 
  Hmm? 
  We're doing Christmas in July? 
  - Carpe diem. 
  - Yeah. 
  Go on, open it. 
  Ohh. 
  Aah. 
  It's beautiful. 
  Thank you. 
  He's too polite to say so, but no single guy needs an afghan. 
  He won't be single much longer. 
  Jared and Lourdes. 
  I didn't want to say anything. 
  Love is never something to feel guilty about. 
  It's a blessing. 
  Thank you. 
  This means so much. 
  Oh. 
  You don't think it's a good idea. 
  He still loves our girl. 
  I'm gonna be with her soon. 
  I'm want to tell her he's okay. 
  All good things, Steve. 
  Who is this man? 
  I have no idea. 
  I find that hard to believe given his fingerprints were all over your cargo hold, and you had unrestricted access. 
  I don't know anything about that. 
  Also, hard to believe seeing as he disappeared from the hospital at the exact same time you were there. 
  Think carefully, Ms. 
  Collins. 
  An unidentified man with uncontrolled access to that aircraft might be responsible for what happened to Flight 828. 
  Are you sure you want to protect him? 
  - What I want is a lawyer. 
  - Good idea. 
  They'll explain you're facing hefty jail time. 
  - I have nothing more to say. 
  - Then just listen before you throw away a one-time opportunity. 
  Tell us what you know. 
  Help us apprehend this fugitive. 
  I'll cut you a deal. 
  You can go home to your wife. 
  I heard a gunshot. 
  Thought our undercover was in jeopardy, so I made the call to go in. 
  The undercover said no shots were fired until after you burst in. 
  You blew his entire operation. 
  It was chaotic. 
  There was a lot going on. 
  He could have easily just mixed up his timeline. 
  Or maybe you were confused. 
  I'm confident in my testimony. 
  Your career's on the line here, Vasquez. 
  We're trying to help out, so one last time would you like to change anything in your statement? 
  I stand by everything I've said. 
  Very well, Detective. 
  Sit tight. 
  Danny. 
  - You can't be here. 
  You - don't give me any option. 
  You ignore my texts, then say you're busy at work. 
  - I called. 
  - They said you took the day off. 
  Danny, I told you I'm trying to rebuild my marriage. 
  This isn't about you and me, Grace. 
  This is about Olive. 
  10 days ago, I practically lived here. 
  - We were a family. 
  - Danny, please, don't. 
  Just Just listen. 
  When I got to Bluemercury, Olive said store security told her to call her dad. 
  She dialed me. 
  She felt guilty that she'd reached out to me and not Ben. 
  I I know I'm not her real dad but for three years, I was all she had. 
  When I lost Nina, I thought I'd I'd be alone forever. 
  And then I found you. 
  So I know I'll survive losing you but I'm not sure I know how to get over losing that amazing kid. 
  It sounds like she feels the same way about you. 
  Detective Vasquez You're stripped of 10 days' pay. 
  That's it? 
  Have a nice day, fellas. 
  I knew someone must have saved my ass. 
  What do you want? 
  You're more valuable to me inside that precinct than off the job forever. 
  You want information about Michaela. 
  I knew you were a smart man. 
  You'll tell me what she does, where she goes, who she talks to all of it. 
  Or? 
  If you needed a double to get over it, I'm guessing the hearing didn't go that well. 
  I only got docked 10 days' pay. 
  That's it? 
  Jared. 
  You standing up for me meant a lot. 
  - It made me realize that I want - Look, if you don't mind, I'm kind of done thinking about the hearing. 
  I should go. 
  Yeah, of course. 
  I don't know how far it'll take you, but that's all I got. 
  Thanks. 
  If you hadn't come back Dad. 
  - We need to go. 
  - All right, in a minute, buddy. 
  I better get him home. 
  Wait until after midnight once the crowds thin out. 
  That'll That'll be safest. 
  - Need to go now, Dad! 
  - Cal - It's all connected. 
  - Dad, come on. 
  Come on, Dad! 
  Let's go! 
  Cal, wait. 
  What is it? 
  Why do we have to go? 
  Someone's coming. 
  Go, it's me they want. 
  Get your son to safety. 
  Good luck. 
  All right, buddy. 
  Time to go. 
  Wait. 
  Wait. 
  I think she's a friend. 
  He brought you this far. 
  Wait! 
  Wait! 
  Hello? 
  Hello? 
  Anyone there? 
  Who is it? 
  Georgia, Bethany's wife. 
  - Hi. 
  - Hi. 
  Oh, thank God I found you. 
  Bethany was arrested on her way back here. 
  Arrested? 
  By whom? 
  Some guy Vance from the NSA. 
  Are you positive you weren't followed? 
  I took the service exit out of our building. 
  Drove around in circles. 
  We need to get on the road. 
  - I don't want to cause no more trouble. 
  - It's no trouble. 
  I know the plan, and I know that Beth would want me to make sure you were safe. 
  Keep practicing your end game, little man. 
  Bye, Thomas. 
  How did you know she was a friend? 
  I don't know. 
  Just a feeling. 
  I'm really tired. 
  Can we go home? 
  Yeah, buddy. 
  Let's go home. 
  Your mom's probably wondering where we are. 
  Hey. 
  Hi. 
  Mwah. 
  - What's wrong? 
  - Mnh. 
  Michaela stopped by earlier. 
  She said you're in trouble at work. 
  It was just a minor flare-up. 
  Everything's under control. 
  She shouldn't have worried you. 
  What worried me is hearing about it from Michaela instead of you. 
  You risked your job to protect her? 
  My job was never in danger. 
  You've never hidden anything from me before. 
  Are you mad that I protected her? 
  She's my best friend, our best friend. 
  And, look I love that you stick up for her. 
  But tell me that's the only reason. 
  I feel bad for Michaela. 
  Everything's been a mess for her since the day that plane landed. 
  And that's it? 
  That's it. 
  Hey, babe. 
  You know what today is? 
  Don't tell me you forgot our three-year first kiss-aversary. 
  Jared, what's wrong? 
  It's back. 
  What is? 
  The plane. 
  Michaela's back. 
  And now more on our continuing coverage of the miracle of Flight 828, landing 5 1/2 years after it went missing. 
  The 191 passengers will return to a world that gave them up for dead. 
  Among these recipients of a miraculous second chance is eminent scholar and professor Dr. 
  Fiona Clarke. 
  Um, I'm gonna go. 
  Y-Yeah. 
  Hey, Mom. 
  Hey, love. 
  Are you okay? 
  Yeah. 
  That's what I should have asked you. 
  When you kept on me about telling your dad about Danny. 
  I thought it was because you were mad at me for not making a clean break. 
  That wasn't it, was it? 
  I love Dad. 
  And I'm so glad that he's back. 
  But Danny's my dad, too. 
  I know and that's okay. 
  I'm gonna see where it leads I'm gonna stand on the peak How's Jared? 
  - Problem solved. 
  - I told you I'd take care of it. 
  Wow. 
  Yeah. 
  My head's spinning. 
  I just needed to see it all clearly. 
  This is a lot of work for a guy who said this morning he wanted nothing to do with the plane, the passengers, the callings. 
  I tried to break away. 
  But Cal brought me back. 
  Is he having callings? 
  He says he's not hearing voices, but he knows things he shouldn't, senses things before they happen. 
  It's not like with us. 
  He's He's different. 
  I can't walk away now. 
  It's like a giant spider web. 
  And we're all trapped in it. 
  It's all connected.
