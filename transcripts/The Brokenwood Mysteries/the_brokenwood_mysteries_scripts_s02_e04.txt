 (COUNTRY SONG PLAYS) 
 ♪ Well, the city looked fine... ♪ 
 Yeah, I'm just thinking, country music isn't really my thing, eh? 
 That's what everyone says until they take that first step. 
 Towards depressing songs about divorce and pain. Woo-hoo. 
 The more painful the divorce, the better the song. 
 And this Holly Collins is the best, you reckon? 
 Best of the best. Oh, she must qualify. 
 'Killing Me With Too Much Kindness' was the biggest country hit in 15 years. 
 Does that mean she's been divorced more times than you? Yeah. 
 Think of it as the Bob Marley of country music. 
 Yeah, I can do that, apart from the fact that she's not black, male, dead or a reggae singer. 
 In all other respects she's incredibly similar. 
 Yeah, sure. 
 You will be wanting one of these after the show. 
 Ha-ha-ha. 
 Can you do me one in red, yellow and green? 
 Sure, why not? All converts are welcome to the church of Holly Collins. 
 I can get her to sign it, too. 
 It will look great on your hunting trip. 
 Yeah, no I'm good with my beanie, thanks. 
 I'll take one. Pick it up after the show. 
 Jared. Mike. 
 Gloria. Thought I might see you here. 
 Oh, wild horses couldn't drag me away. So, what do you think hey? 
 Hot off the press. Keen? 
 Yeah, not sure about the pink. 
 Come on, it's Holly's favourite colour. Are you a true fan or not? 
 Oh, he's her number one fan. 
 Oh, I don't think that is true because I am her number one fan. 
 I'm number two. Join the queue, folks. 
 Oh, my god. Oh, I love it. Ritchie, what the hell! 
 Yeah, Ritch, why weren't we the first? 
 I'll put two aside. And damn well signed. 
 Of course, Celia. I'm sorry to interrupt. 
 I'm Celia Lazenby. 
 Mike. I'm her bestie, Rayleen Hogg. 
 Gloria. 
 Jared. 
 So excited. 
 So excited, Ceils. We never miss a show. 
 Ain't that the truth, Ritchie? Never. 
 Got to go. Come on, Rayls. See ya. 
 So, that's two shirts for you? 
 Ah, just the hat, thanks. 
 Shall we? 
 Yes. 
 So excited. 
 ♪ Take that little ring off my finger ♪ 
♪ And march me back up the aisle ♪ 
♪ Do you want to be a little lady ♪ 
♪ Or your honey baby ♪ 
♪ All you ever do is lie, lie, lie. ♪ 
 Thank you so much. You have been so kind. 
 And speaking of kindness we're gonna finish up with my current single, 'Killing Me With Too Much Kindness'. 
 One, two, three, four. 
 Wait! There's one more thing to say, and it's kind of big. 
 With certain things going on in my private life change is in the wind. 
 Time to spread my wings on a more permanent basis. 
 So, tonight is the last time 'The Hole in the Wall Gang' will play together. 
 Brokenwood, you have given me the pleasure of being a great audience for the last time. 
 And it's been a great ride. But it's time for me to move to Nashville. 
 Wahoo. Yeah, Holly girl. 
 Alright. Go, Holly! 
 Yeah, I'm pretty sure Bob Marley never went to Nashville, eh. 
 Alright, then. Let's go. 
 One, two, three, four. 
 ♪ There's a rose beside the note on my pillow... ♪ 
 Sleep well, fellas. 
 ♪ ..candlelight and wine when I come home... ♪ 
 Do you think they get it? 
 You're breaking up the band. End of story. 
 With no warning. Yeah, they'll get used to it. 
 ♪ Coz I'll only bring you pain... ♪ 
 Even Lucy? 
 Ah, I'll handle her. 
 She's not your problem. 
 But I'm her problem. 
 Ever since you woke up in my bed I became a very big problem to Lucy Choo. 
 Yeah. Well, that ends tonight. Drink. 
 ♪ Good men come to... ♪ 
 It numbs the pain, baby. 
 I could murder a ciggie.

 (MUSIC STOPS) 
 (AMP HUMS) 
 (FOREBODING MUSIC) 
 (SCREAMS) 
 Mike, I'm sorry for your loss. 
 I didn't actually know her, Gina. 
 But her music spoke to you. 
 Mike, I'm all good to handle this one if you'd rather. 
 I'm fine. 
 The current from the amp was still arcing when she was found. 
 "Goodbye. Holly C." 
 As far as suicide notes go it's on the shorter side. 
 Same shade? 
 Maybe. 
 Close? 
 Darker? 
 "Pink Panther." Oh, god, tried that once. 
 Clashed with everything. 
 You don't want your usual chat with..? 
 Whatever it was Holly had to say was probably best heard through her songs. 
 The cleaner came in at 7:30 after complaints that a song had been heard playing over and over again on the stereo. 
 Which song? 
 Uh, 'Killing Me With Too Much Kindness'. 
 Mmm. 
 That is not pizza sauce, is it? 
 Someone's bleeding. 
 Over to you, Gina. Suspicious? 
 Oh, god, 'Brokenwood Courier', 11:00. 
 Would you like me to shoot some stuff? 
 Hey! We have our own photographer. 
 Right. But it is Holly Collins in there, isn't it? 
 Cushla, there's been no formal identification, but as soon as there has you will be the first to know. 
 OK. 
 OK, this is feeling a little weird, but there's no sign of Jessica James, the drummer, or the bass player whose name, believe it or not, is Slim Fingers. 
 Also there's no sign of Lucy Choo, the fiddle player, and there's no sign of Waylon Strings. 
 That can't be his real name. 
 Nor the two roadies, Dan and Kev, or their tour manager, Ritchie Mathis. 
 Yeah, I met him last night. 
 I tried his room, number 203, no answer. 
 But the tour truck and roadies van is still here. 
 So, we have a dead country music star and every member ofher band is AWOL. 
 I heard she broke up the band last night. 
 That's true. 
 Or did she wipe them off the face of the earth? 
 Start rounding them up. They can't have got far. 
 Jessica James? 
 Jesse. 
 What's going on? 
 DSC Mike Shepherd. What is it? 
 Holly Collins has been found dead. 
 No way! Did you say here last night? 
 Yeah. I went to get breakfast. 
 Hangover. 
 Did she top herself? 
 Why would you say that? 
 Why else would she be dead? 
 Have you seen the other band members this morning? 
 No. 
 What time did you leave? 
 7:30. I don't know. Couldn't sleep. 
 It's a long time to get Twisties. 
 I had to walk because Ritchie's god knows where with the keys to the van. 
 How's Waylon taking it? 
 I haven't seen Waylon yet. 
 Must have gone for a drive. His car's not there. 
 Was it there this morning when you left? 
 I don't know. 
 Could barely open my eyes. 
 Can I go back to my room now? I need a drink. 
 Hair of the dog and all that. 
 We'll need to talk further. 
 Sure. 
 Waylon may best be tracked down via his distinctive car, a silver blue Mercedes Benz 1983 sedan. 
 Jesse James reckons he's probably out driving. 
 He may not even know about Holly's demise. 
 Depending on when he left, before Holly electrocuted herself. 
 Or after he'd done the deed. 
 Then again it could have been an accident. 
 She's in the bath. Gets an idea for a song, grabs the guitar and... 
 Are you finished? 
 Yep. 
 The country music world lost a shining star today. 
 A little bit of empathy might not go amiss. 
 Sorry. I'm just saying that it's very common for musos to, you know, get struck by inspiration and... 
 Electrocute themselves in the bath. 
 OK. Not all of them, obviously, but they get carried away. 
 There was a bottle of bourbon. 
 There had been a party. 
 Maybe it was just a drunken mistake. 
 Yeah, what about the message? 
 Could have been for the cleaners. 
 Lipstick on a mirror is not going to make a cleaner very happy. 
 Let's just say the message is ambiguous at best. 
 Put out a 10-1 on the Mercedes. 
 Roger. 
 Talk some more to Jesse James. 
 Right after you finish questioning 'Billy the Kid'. 
 Breen! 
 Sorry. 
 Find out more about where Waylon and Holly were at as a couple. 
 So, we're discounting suicide? 
 I'm not feeling it. 
 Until we've got a time of death... 
 Accident, murder, suicide. 
 It's all up for grabs. 
 The rigor mortis is accentuated by the muscle spasm. 
 The electrical current caused the muscles to contract. 
 Normally, because the current runs through her for, perhaps, many hours, she would have become burnt like toast, but the presence of the bath water has meant she's only lightly poached. 
 Time of death? 
 Given the damage to her internal organs through the cooking process it is hard to be specific. 
 Between 1:00 and 6:00. 
 Do you think that this matches that? 
 The discolouration makes it hard to say. 
 Pink Panther. 
 Every cheap hooker from Moscow to Hiratsuka was wearing this five years ago. 
 It clashes with everything. 
 Thank you, Gina. 
 When will we be able to open again? 
 I'm paying cleaners to stand around. 
 As soon as forensics are done I'll let you know. 
 Bloody musos. 
 ♪ Loving you is damage ♪ 
♪ Putting it all on the line ♪ 
♪ I try not to blame you ♪ 
♪ But it keeps coming back... ♪ 
 Did you find what you were looking for in my room? 
 We thought you weren't near. 
 Well, now I am. 
 Were you at the party last night? 
 Yeah. 
 What time did you leave? 
 Same time as Ritchie. 
 And that was? 
 12:30, maybe, don't know. 
 I'm just the drummer. 
 Any idea where Ritchie is? 
 I guess he's with Slim. 
 And where might that be? 
 I'm just the drummer. 
 So, you didn't notice anything unusual in Holly's demeanour last night. 
 She broke up the band without any notice on stage in front of 500 people. 
 Apart from that, no, nothing unusual. 
 So, Holly breaks up the band and yet you all come back here and party like one big happy family. 
 I wouldn't say that. 
 Just like that, after three years you decide to bugger off to Nashville without a word? 
 I'm sorry, Ritch. 
 Like hell you are. 
 Ritchie, be cool. 
 You, you put her up to it. 
 You're a bum, dude, drink more. 
 It's over. 
 I've worked my butt off for you and you're just gonna cut and run. 
 You got to change to grow. 
 What are you, a chrysalis? 
 OK. 
 You're heading for a smack in the head. 
 Come on, Ritchie. 
 You're gonna crash and burn, baby. 
 So, this was around 12:30am? 
 Give or take. 
 Lucy Choo, she wasn't there. 
 Already left. 
 And Slim Fingers? 
 Unconscious. 
 Slim likes to mix and match his party consumables. 
 Slim. 
 Time to rock'n'roll. Let's go. 
 After you left, what happened? 
 I went to bed. 
 With Ritchie Mathis? 
 Yeah. 
 How long have you two been an item? 
 Whenever we're on the road. 
 OK. 
 Thanks, Jessica. 
 Jesse. 
 Slim Fingers was passed out in Holly's room at 12:30am. 
 No-one saw him leave? 
 No-one of the one band member we've managed to locate. 
 Still no sign of them? 
 Well, Ritchie, yet. 
 Jess's still here. 
 No Lucy Choo? 
 Strange. 
 Well, it's the world of country music, Mike! Need I say more?

 Oh, hello. 
 Celia, wasn't it? 
 And Rayleen. 
 Can we put this here? 
 We need to do something before we leave town. 
 Perhaps to the side. 
 We've attended every concert in the last five years. Every one. 
 And now, nothing. 
 Oh, god damn it. 
 It's OK, Ceils. It's OK. 
 I'm sorry. I'm just blubbering away and you were obviously a fan. 
 I'm making it all about me. 
 Holly was something special. 
 Yeah. 
 Suicide, really? 
 Whatever way you look at it it's a tragedy. 
 Just doesn't make any sense. 
 She was going onto greater things. 
 So, why would she just... 
 You have obviously followed Holly's life closely. 
 Probably knew her better than she knew herself. 
 That first album, hey, Ceils? 
 'Home Grown and Divorced' was the soundtrack of my life. 
 Losing my husband Alvin. 
 I'm sorry to hear that. 
 No, not at all. 
 Holly got me through. 
 She mentioned last night on stage personal issues contributing to her move to Nashville. 
 What do you think she was referring to? 
 Perhaps you should ask Lucy Choo. 
 Why is that? 
 Holly's biggest personal issue was that when she got involved with Waylon... 
 Lucy was none too happy. 
 No siree. 
 Not that Waylon's a saint. 
 Meaning? 
 Lucy was not the only one. 
 Jesse James, too, then Holly. 
 A busy man. 
 Moving to Nashville would have been a way to shake Lucy Choo off and then just get on with doing what she did best, but now it's not to be. 
 I appreciate your insight. 
 Tell me, you weren't at the party last night, were you? 
 Oh, no, we're not in the inner sanctum. 
 We're fans, not groupies. 
 So, we have a dead body, two missing roadies. 
 A missing bass player. 
 A missing guitar player. 
 A missing tour manager. 
 A missing fiddle player. 
 But at least we have a drummer. 
 Although, according to her, drummer's aren't meant to know much, and she seems intent on maintaining that standard. 
 And she has no idea where he is? 
 Or Slim. And the room that she shares with Ritchie was a mess like they'd a fight or... 
 Or they're into trashy motel rooms. 
 Don't you think it's rather convenient that the lead singer of a band is found dead and yet only one of the others can be found? 
 Well, according to the fans Lucy Choo has an axe to grind with Waylon. 
 Jilted lover stuff. 
 Holly was taking him offshore, eliminate the problem. 
 If it's not an accident or suicide. 
 It's not either. 
 Based on? 
 A hunch. 
 Breen. 
 Hi. 
 Hello. My name is Lucy Choo. 
 You left your card under my door. 
 We've been trying to find you. 
 Sorry, heavy sleeper. 
 Right. 
 I heard the news about Holly. 
 Hence the card. 
 Have you talked to Waylon yet? 
 He's on our list. 
 Oh. 
 I texted Waylon, "Where are you?" 
 He replies, "Beach." 
 What time was this? 
 About an hour ago. 
 Then I told him I wanted him to bring back Choosie. 
 Sorry. Choosie? 
 My daughter. Our daughter. 
 Your daughter's name is Choosie. 
 Choosie Choo, yeah, I know. 
 It was Waylon's idea. 
 About the only contribution he's ever made. 
 Anyway, he says that they're having fun. 
 So, then I call him to tell him why he needs to come back and he doesn't answer. 
 May I? 
 Maybe his phone's gone down. 
 No, it rings. He doesn't answer. 
 Could be on silent. 
 So, Choosie stayed with Waylon last night? 
 No, she was with me. 
 She woke early, as usual. 
 Mummy, wake up. 
 I want to give daddy a cuddle. 
 No. 
 Go. Go then. 
 You know his room? 
 102. 
 It's '1' an '0' and a '2', OK. 
 Go straight there and jump on his head. 
 I wanted to sleep in. 
 Plus, the thought of Choosie waking her hung over father at some ungodly hour, well, who am I to stand in the way of quality father-daughter time? 
 Maybe he'll answer a different number. 
 Hay, Waylon here. 
 You know what to do. 
 You think they're at the beach? 
 That's what he said. 
 With no idea about what's happened? 
 He has my daughter with him. 
 You're a heavy sleeper, huh? 
 Why? 
 Well, it's 12:30. 
 You've only just woken up. 
 I suppose it's a musician thing. 
 I take pills. 
 Touring messes with your sleep patterns, plus having a young kid it's not easy. 
 Especially touring with a kid. 
 She wouldn't see her father otherwise. 
 How did you feel about Holly moving to Nashville? 
 Girl's got to do what a girl's got to do. 
 Shepherd. 
 Man : Famous country singer found dead on your patch. 
 Sorry for your loss. 
 I didn't actually know her. 
 I know I felt the same way about Whitney Houston. 
 She spoke to me in song. 
 Do you need Wilmott up there to manage the impending media storm? 
 No. 
 Oh, go on, you know you want to. 
 I really don't. 
 We've got everything under control so far. 
 I hear you've grown a beard. 
 I'm doing the goat trail, an ironman thing over the Riverstone Range. 
 It's my mountain man work. 
 'Grummy' here says I look like a hipster. 
 Can you had been a hipster at your age? 
 You're only as old as you feel, mate. 
 Well, when you change your mind about Wilmott, you let me know. 
 Actually, could you do me a background on a Waylon Strings? 
 That bloke's been here since dawn. 
 Doesn't remember seeing anyone that matches Waylon and Choosie's description. 
 Is there another beach? 
 Riverstone Heads, Tahuna Point, but I reckon I'll get you back to the motel. 
 Chances are he'll show up there. 
 No. The other beaches first. 
 Ms Marlowe, ladies. 
 Detective. That was Cushla from the 'Brokenwood Courier'. 
 Yes. 
 We had our photos taken for the paper. 
 We're not in the way, are we? 
 Not at the moment. 
 Oh, such a tragedy and so young. 
 You were fans? 
 Oh, we've been known to sing along with Holly on the radio at sewing circle. 
 Of course, she was 27. 
 So, I'm thinking hard drugs. 
 Choked on her own vomit, did she? 
 This is an ongoing... 
 Investigation, of course. 
 This is lovely, though. 
 Well... 
 So thoughtful. 
 How far fans will go to show their love. 
 I was saying to Cushla it reminds me of a time my husband and I went to the Pere Lachaise cemetery in Paris. 
 Is that where people keep... 
 Jim Morrison's grave for one. 
 Oh, we spent a lovely summer there in '75, my husband and I. 
 They were such a nice group of young people. 
 Mrs Marlowe, ladies. 
 Oh, Detective Sims. 
 Jean was just telling me about Paris in the '70s. 
 Oh, that sounds nice. 
 It was. Cheese roll? 
 Oh, not for me. Thank you. 
 Ooh... 
 Probably should get on. 
 Holly decides to end it for whatever reason. 
 Her personal issues have got the better of her. 
 So, she grabs her lipstick and writes a farewell. "Goodbye". 
 Full stop. "Holly C", but is that a dot or a dash? 
 Ah, dot. 
 Full stop. Period. 
 Sure. If it's deliberate, then yes, it's a sign of goodbye, but what if that's a lazy dash off the end of the 'E'? 
 Then it becomes a different statement altogether. 
 "Goodbye - Holly C". 
 And where is the lipstick that was used? 
 None of the ones that we found in here are a match. 
 Whatever the shade was on her lips and the mirror, it's not here. 
 So, if she did write the message, what did she do with the lipstick? 
 And then there's the matter of the guitar. 
 So, she wants to make a statement. 
 Go out playing her song, except she plays left-handed guitar not right. 
 Even as a drunken mistake that position makes no sense. 
 It wasn't a suicide. 
 Or an accident. 
 She wasn't playing guitar, she was shielding herself from whoever it was that wanted her dead. 
 (PHONE RINGS) 
 Sims. 
 Roger that. 
 Whereabouts? Yeah. 
 On my way. 
 You look like you're in a very bad music video. 
 We should head back to the motel. 
 You said there was another beach. 
 The thing is with New Zealand being three large islands when someone says "at the beach" the options are quite comprehensive. 
 OK, look, when my dad would take me out on the holidays it was about making up for lost time, right? 
 We would go to the movies, the beach, play golf. 
 Golf? She's five. 
 Mini golf. 
 No, Waylon hates golf. 
 The point is maybe they've moved onto other stuff. 
 Why isn't he answering his phone then? 
 Try calling him again. 
 There's no coverage. 
 You'd be Slim Fingers then? 
 Is this really necessary? 
 I was just after a prescription. 
 Yeah. Hold that thought. 
 He would have been given takeaways. 
 Takeaways? 
 When a Methadone addict leaves town they're given their exact dose to get them through their daily requirements and these are called takeaways. 
 But the rules are strict, otherwise you'd get people hopping from pharmacy to pharmacy with their sob stories. 
 Like Slim. 
 Mmm. He's obviously abused his supply, sold the packs. 
 If he doesn't get any what would the prognosis be? 
 He'll feel like an elephant gave birth in his head. 
 Right. 
 Oh, Slim Fingers has been found. 
 I'm talking to him now. 
 Good. 
 Forensics have found traces of blood on the guitar that was on the floor. 
 OK. That tastes weird. 
 You did ask for five sugars. 
 Yeah, but the coffee's burnt. 
 I don't think so. 
 Maybe the milk's off. 
 Nope. 
 You don't have a Red Bull, or something stronger? 
 Slim, are you high? 
 Hey? 
 No way. Nah. 
 If anything I'm feeling pretty low. 
 Bad news and all that. 
 She's a good girl, that Holly. 
 Actually I'd really like a cigarette. 
 Yeah. Well, there's no smoking in here, sorry. 
 Sure. 
 OK. Firstly, I'm gonna to need you to consent to a blood test. 
 Hey. Why? 
 There is blood residue in Holly's unit on a guitar. 
 Guitarists nick their fingers all the time. It's no big deal. 
 You have a wound on your face. 
 If it's your blood that might explain something, at least. 
 Plus you have blood on your cuff. 
 So, can you hand the shirt over? 
 Or I could get a court order. 
 She's really dead, then? Holly? 
 Yeah. Sorry. 
 Waylon will be gutted. 
 Yeah, we don't know where he is. 
 Do you? 
 He wasn't with you last night? 
 Actually, if I don't have that cigarette I think I'm gonna throw up. 
 The adjoining bedroom has no duvet. 
 Should it match this one? 
 They get nicked all the time. 
 Your people wouldn't have moved it? 
 As soon as you jokers turned up we were told to down tools. 
 And bath towels. 
 Holly's room's got three unused. 
 It's a double unit. 
 Should have been four. 
 Thanks. 
 Tell ya, last time we have musos through here. 
 Senior. 
 (THUDDING) 
 Hello. 
 (THUDDING) 
 Hello. 
 I think you might have the wrong room. 
 Ah, that's better. 
 A little of what you like, eh? 
 No harm done. 
 If you say so. 
 I've been clean for a lot of years now. 
 Ask any of the band. 
 Totally clean. 
 Clean, as in only using methadone. 
 OK. Now I'm feeling judged. 
 I'm just trying to get some straight answers. 
 About last night? 
 About your movements in the last 12 hours. 
 Witnesses say you were crashed out in Holly's spare room. 
 Oh, yeah, that would be right, but I left. 
 What time? 
 Well, can't remember. 
 1am? 2am? 3am? 
 I woke up when my phone rang. 
 (PHONE RINGS) 
 Yeah. One of the roadies invited me to some pub. 
 It was an awesome night. 
 Which pub? Brokenwood Arms? 
 Yeah. Yeah, I reckon. 
 So, this was after midnight? 
 2am. 
 There are no pubs in Brokenwood licenced beyond 1:00. 
 You calling me a liar? 
 I'm just trying to get your story to make sense. 
 So, if the roadies rang you from this so-called pub then they'd obviously already left the motel. 
 Yeah, definitely. 
 I just don't remember when. 
 Well, you received a call. 
 Why notcheck your phone? 
 Oh, yeah.Brilliant. Nice one. 
 You know, if we were to go back to the chemist and you were to help me with the - youknow - things would be a whole lot sweeter and Icould help you a whole lot better. 
 Why don't you just check your phone? 
 Right. 
 Flat.Bummer. 
 Why don't yousleep things off while I go find acharger for your phone? 
 Yeah, I can work with that. 
 OK. 
 I know just the place. 
 I was looking for some memorabilia to add to the shrine. 
 You were hiding in the wardrobe. 
 Holly had borrowed a dress of mine. 
 It's a crime scene. 
 Adding to that climbing through the back window is breaking and entering. 
 I was looking for money. 
 Hard to repay a loan when the person you borrow off is dead. 
 I've been ripped off enough by Holly Collins. 
 Ripped off, how? 
 Did you take anything? 
 I was only in there two minutes before you turned up. 
 That isn't a "No". 
 It wasn't there. 
 What? 
 What, you wouldn't understand. 
 Jesse, I recommend you consult with a lawyer. 
 In the meantime I have somewhere you can wait. 
 Are you arresting me? 
 For breaking and entering a crime scene, no less. 
 A suicide isn't a crime. 
 No, but murder is. 
 I thought it was a suicide. 
 Do you have a lawyer back in the city? 
 I'll get you a list of duty solicitors. 
 They're not here. 
 We put out an alert on Waylon's car to all units. 
 We'll follow up with another for Waylon and Choosie if they're not back by 6:00. 
 Is there someone..? 
 I'm OK. 
 I'll just wait. 
 Yeah. 
 Yeah, thanks. 
 I've just put Jesse James from 'The Hole in the Wall Gang' in the cells. 
 Right next to Slim Fingers. 
 I feel like I've been teleported to the Wild West. 
 (ELECTRONIC BEEP) 
 Bugger. 
 Oi, Slim, I need your pass code. 
 A trip to the chemist is in order first. 
 I don't think so. Pass code. 
 You don't have to say anything, Slim. 
 Slim can speak for himself. 
 I'm all good, thanks, Jesse. 
 You can't hold him without a lawyer. 
 I don't need a lawyer because I haven't done anything wrong. 
 What I need is my medication. 
 Yeah, well, what I need is the truth. 
 I've told you everything I know. 
 The Brokenwood Arms don't remember a country musician helping them contravene licensing laws last night. 
 Well, it might have been the Riverside Bar and Grill. 
 No such place. 
 It was more of a private club. 
 Were you even at a club? 
 Yeah. It was a big night. 
 Your pass code. 
 You remember that much, surely? 
 That's the thing, I'm damned if I can remember numbers when I'm not feeling on top of my game. 
 The paperwork is gonna be horrendous. 
 I'll supply whatever is required to ease the bureaucratic pain. 
 Ah-uh. Password first. 
 One, two, three, four. 
 I'll forget it otherwise. 
 Kev? 
 Let's see. Yeah, it was Kev. 
 1:37am. 
 'The Lying Toad'. 
 What? 
 I reckon that's what the bar was called. 
 Mike, Slim Fingers most likely left Holly's unit by 1:45am. 
 Got it. Ta. 
 Yeah, nice one, Muz. 
 Detective, what can I do you for? 
 A musician by the name of Slim Fingers was drinking here late last night. 
 Did he say what time? 
 After 2am. 
 Whoa. OK. 
 This was an after-hours event and no way was I contravening my licence. 
 Yeah, I'm not interested in that. 
 Alright. Well, we did have a bit of a private party after closing. 
 Great night, actually. 
 So, Slim was here. 
 Yeah, and a couple of fellows by the names of... 
 Dan and Kev. 
 Roadies. 
 My god, they can handle their grog. 
 I've had the likes of Pink Floyd and The Beatles through here, but those country fellows they redefine the laws of physics when it comes to drinking. 
 Pink Floyd? 
 Alright, tribute bands, but they were dead ringers, the lot of them. 
 So, what time did Dan and Kev leave? 
 As a matter of fact they didn't. 
 Truth be told it feels like the four horsemen of the apocalypse have ridden through my head. 
 There's always a price to pay for golden memories. 
 We didn't wind up until about 5am, so the fellas dossed here. 
 The other bloke left. 
 Slim. 
 Yeah, it was Slim. 
 Rick, I think his name was. 
 Ritchie. 
 That will be it. 
 Afternoon, fellas. 
 Dan and Kev, there's something you should know. 
 Recorded : Hey, Waylon here. 
 You know what to do. 
 (CLOCK TICKS) 
 Hey. Long-planned hunting trip. 
 Yeah, I want to make it to Redmond's Hut before dark. 
 Hey, sorry to hear about Holly Collins. 
 I felt the same when Bob Marley died. 
 Were you even born when Marley died? 
 Nah, but I felt it in a cosmic sense. 
 Be careful out there. 
 Yeah, you too. 
 Oh, are you sure you're OK? 
 You kind of just stepped out there. 
 Don't worry about it. It was my fault. My mind was on other things. 
 Yeah, mine was nearly all over the road with your coffee. 
 I thought you were leaving town? 
 Oh, we were but Winnie got a temperature. 
 Winnie is your..? 
 Our motor home. Well, Celia's. 
 She overheats sometimes. 
 Cracked hose pipe. 
 Just picked up a new one. 
 Must get back and stick it in before dark. 
 Bon voyage. 
 Actually, Rayleen, tell me, since you're here, there seems to have been tension between Jesse James and Holly Collins. 
 Do you know what that was about? 
 The song, 'Killing Me With Too Much Kindness'. 
 Yeah, got to be my favourite. 
 Jesse reckons Holly stole it off her. 
 That she came up with the song? 
 Sour grapes if you ask me. 
 She's just the drummer. 
 Oh, very good one. 
 Now, Holly's dead, well, she can say anything she likes, can't she? 
 Can I buy you a coffee? 
 Why don't I make you one since yours is icing the tar seal. 
 Our camp site is just out of town. 
 Celia is the true expert. 
 Anything you want to know, ask Ceils. 
 I'll follow you. 
 OK. 
 Oh, here's Holly when she won the Silver Scroll Award. 
 And this is us waiting to see her at the Gold Guitar Awards. 
 We waited in line for an hour but she gave me and Rayls a lovely selfie. 
 You really did follow her everywhere. 
 Five years this spring. 
 Cost me my marriage, toing and froing from San Fran every time Holly was touring, but I just couldn't not come. 
 And when Holly sang it was like being spoken to by an Angel. 
 And, just quietly, the alimony from Alvin in the States funds my travels. 
 So, as Holly said in 'Divorced Heart'... 
 ♪ There's pain in love and no love without pain ♪ 
♪ You broke my heart ♪ 
♪ But hope remains and where there's hope... ♪ 
♪ There will be love again. ♪ 
 Very good. 
 Do you think there's hope for you and Alvin, then? 
 No. 
 Oh, no. He likes brass bands. 
 
 
 
 (KETTLE WHISTLES) 
 You say jazz, I say country, let's call the whole thing off. 
 Sorry, I'm just babbling, aren't I? 
 No, not at all. 
 Tell me, that shade of lipstick on that photo of Holly. 
 Blood Pink. 
 Wow, you're good. 
 I read about it in the latest issue of 'Country Singer'. 
 Here we go. Yeah. 
 She had this interview and, yep, right there, blood pink. 
 Very hard to get. 
 Made by some exclusive boutique outfit in New York. 
 Fervent. 
 That's it. 
 Oh, God. What a waste. 
 (TINNY MUSIC) 
 Is that your phone, Rayls? 
 Bloody Mum. 
 Oh, did you change your ringtone? 
 What? 
 Oh, yeah, changed it so I'd know it was her and not have to answer it. 
 Mothers, can't live with them, can't live on without them. Ha-ha-ha. 
 Oops, milk. Hang on. 
 Rayleen's mum is a bit high maintenance. 
 Total burden, actually. 
 When we go on the road she has to go into care. 
 So, where were we? 
 Did you show him my ticket stub collection? 
 Yes, very impressive. 
 And Ceils has got an autograph from every gig. 
 Ritchie usually organises that for us. 
 How well do you know Ritchie? 
 Well enough to get what we want. 
 More coffee? 
 Actually, I need to go. 
 You'll be off tomorrow, then? 
 Yep. 
 Fixed the hose part, hit the road. 
 Got to get back to mum. 
 She's a bit needy. 
 I'm gonna give you my phone number just in case you have any more questions. 
 There you go. 
 Thank you. 
 It was a pleasure meeting you both. 
 Country fan in need. 
 Is a country friend indeed. 
 Jesse James is speaking with her lawyer. 
 Is it Latham? 
 Oh, god no, she didn't. 
 Yep, legal oil slick that is Dennis Buchanan. 
 Fun times ahead. 
 Ritchie Mathis was drinking at the 'Frog and Cheetah' until 5am. 
 It seems that Jesse James's comment about them going to bed at 12:30 was misinformed. 
 I think the word you're looking for is "misleading". 
 Jesse, there's something you're not telling us. 
 My client has disclosed her reasons. 
 For entering a crime scene, no, she hasn't. 
 You don't have to answer that. 
 Dennis, I haven't asked her a question. 
 You were going to. 
 It's an interview room. 
 You're not obliged to answer any question not relating to the charge. 
 Can we start with why you were in the room? 
 You don't have to answer that. 
 Jesus, Dennis, it was the crime scene. 
 You didn't make that clear. 
 I might have been looking for something I misplaced. 
 What was that? 
 My client may have simply been disorientated and thought she was looking for something in her own room. 
 Dennis, do you actually listen to what comes out of your mouth? 
 Sound professional advice, Detective Shepherd. 
 That's what I hear. 
 Does it have anything to do with the fact that you believe Holly stole your song? 
 No. 
 No! 
 Can my client and I have a few moments, please? 
 Where did you hear about that? 
 That odd couple of country music fans. 
 They are a mine of gossip and innuendo. 
 So, what would she have been looking for? 
 Proof, I'm guessing. 
 I don't know, but it makes sense. 
 She's got this issue with Holly and then she finds out Holly plans to skip the country. 
 She's angry, frustrated. 
 And decides to knock her off. 
 How does that help her cause? 
 Well, if Holly's dead she can't defend herself. 
 Jesse stakes her claim on what she believes is rightly hers, but only with proof. 
 So, you believe her? 
 (KNOCKING) 
 We're about to find out. 
 There's a demo I made of the song. 
 I played it for Holly. She dismissed it, said it was unformed. 
 Was it unformed? 
 It was a demo, a work in progress, right, that's how these things work. 
 But it was an actual song. 
 Next thing she's recorded, 'Killing Me With Too Much Kindness'. 
 It's a hit. I'm thinking, "That's not fair. That's my song." 
 Is that what your song was called? 
 'Filling Me With Love's Blindness'. 
 It's not exactly catchy, is it? 
 The title is irrelevant. 
 It's about the music. 
 Without the demo I can't prove the song's mine. 
 No-one will believe me. 
 I figured Holly had taken it. 
 I wanted it back. 
 But you didn't find it. 
 Jesse, do you know where Ritchie Mathis is? 
 No. 
 You told me that you and Ritchie left the party around 12:30am and you went back to your room. 
 Yeah. 
 Yet witnesses have Ritchie drinking at the 'Frog and Cheetah' until 5am. 
 OK. 
 It's not my client's concern where Ritchie Mathis chooses to drink. 
 Actually, Dennis, it is. 
 Which means he wasn't in your room all night. 
 He was stumbling around and then he left. 
 To go where? 
 He didn't say. 
 My client's answered the question. 
 But he wasn't with you. 
 So, he wasn't there, so what? 
 It means no-one can verify where you were all night. 
 OK. OK. 
 He came back drunk. 
 I mean, really hammered. 
 Hey, Jesse! No, no, wake up. 
 Get off, you freak. 
 I've figured it out. 
 Figured out what? 
 I don't know. 
 What was he looking for? 
 The cash takings, I guess. 
 They're gone. 
 Then what happened? 
 I kicked him out. 
 Sleep it off! 
 I love you, Jesse. 
 I'm gonna teach them a big fair lesson. 
 Them being? 
 He didn't say. 
 Why didn't you mention this before? 
 He was drunk. 
 It didn't mean anything. 
 OK. I think that's enough. 
 Ritchie is a good guy, truly. 
 He was upset. We were all upset. 
 To a degree. 
 It's all about context. 
 No, we were totally gutted. 
 Holly Collins stuck a knife through the heart of the band. 
 People were upset. 
 Christ, it's only human, isn't it? 
 I think my client's helped you more than enough. 
 So, unless you want to press further charges she'll be leaving now, with me. 
 Ms James, I strongly advise you to leave. Now. 
 Don't go too far. 
 He's still not answering his phone. 
 Hey, it's Ritchie Mathis from 'The Hole in the Wall Gang'. 
 Leave it. 
 (SCREAMS) 
 We'll be in touch. 
 Oh, I hate it when that happens. 
 There you are. 
 The missing towel. 
 Finding your daughter is our top priority. 
 Now do you get it? Do you? 
 This is heavy stuff, fella. 
 You cops and them, what's going on? 
 Kylie. 
 Lucy, this is Kylie from Victim Support. I need you to go with her. 
 I'll be there as soon as I can with an update. 
 Let's go somewhere warm. 
 No car, no cell phone, no daughter. 
 Just a pack of cigarettes, three guitar picks and a bank card. 
 Waylon was never at the beach. 
 I doubt he was ever with Choosie at all. 
 Which means she's been missing for over 12 hours. 
 Whoever knows about Waylon's demise has his cell phone. 
 And sent misleading texts. 
 They're still out there and they still might be running interference. 
 Anything from Ritchie Mathis? 
 No. 
 Gina. Time of death estimate? 
 Mike! 
 Off the record. 
 I can tell that he has been dead maybe 12 hours, maybe. 
 Maybe more? 
 Mike, you have to wait. 
 Go with Gina. 
 Phone through the rest. 
 Roundup everyone we've got. 
 Cause of death? 
 It's not rocket science, is it? 
 What about this? 
 Maybe he was he was very bad at shaving. 
 How quickly can you zero in on the time of death? 
 This is not a fast food joint. 
 It takes time. 
 Gina, we have a missing child. 
 I'm aware of that. 
 But in Russia there is a saying, a meal cooked in haste will never have the taste. 
 Have you ever tried under-cooked borscht? 
 What is borscht? 
 Beetroot and cabbage stewed in sour milk. 
 Mmm. No. 
 Made in a hurry it is not nice. 
 Sorry, are we really discussing gastronomy right now? 
 When Mike attends this he doesn't talk so much. 
 You're seeking this five-year-old girl. 
 Her name is Choosie Choo. 
 She was last seen leaving room 206 at 5:30am this morning. 
 She's wearing a brown onesie, similar to this. 
 Possibly carrying a teddy bear that she calls Freddy. 
 And also any sightings of a 1983 silver-blue Mercedes, and this man, Ritchie Mathis, 38, last seen around a similar time. 
 Let's go. 
 (PHONE RINGS) 
 Kristin. 
 Yeah, Gina, reckons possibly even 18 hours. 
 So he could have been killed between 1am and 6am. 
 OK. Thanks. 
 If Waylon was dead before 6:00, then when Choosie came down to the unit, who let her in? 
 Holly was dead in the bath and Waylon was wrapped in a duvet in the laundry. 
 OK. Waylon's blood has been matched to that on Slim's clothing. 
 Bring him back in. 
 Oh, come on. Why am I here? 
 It must be nearly midnight. 
 The blood on the electric guitar, it matches Waylon's. 
 So, it's his guitar. 
 He has, like, eight. 
 And there was blood on the bench in Holly's unit that matches Waylon's. 
 OK. 
 And the blood on your cuff matches Waylon's. 
 How do you explain that? 
 Nope. I can't. I have no idea. 
 How did you get the graze on your forehead? 
 I must have banged my head. 
 Any idea how? 
 Well, no wonder I can't remember anything. 
 I've probably got a concussion. 
 I should probably head to the chemist. 
 So you can get something for it? 
 I don't think so, Slim. 
 Were you in a fight? 
 Look, I've just lost a really good buddy and a lead singer. 
 And I'm not feeling that good about that. 
 Were you in a fight? 
 I should be with Lucy. 
 She needs me. 
 Lucy is with Victim Support. 
 She's being looked after. 
 Were you in a fight with Waylon? 
 No! 
 Only his car. 
 His car? 
 Yeah. 
 After I got the call from Kev. 
 Just try to stop me. 
 I remember thinking it was bloody funny, actually. 
 Wah! 
 Oh, next time you won't so lucky. 
 Woo-hoo! 
 Yeah, that's what happened. 
 So, what time does that chemist open? 
 (PHONE RINGS) 
 Talk to me. 
 The 24-hour service station guy recalls seeing a car matching Waylon's here last night. 
 I've got CCTV. 
 No sign of a child in there, and according to Lucy, Choosie was in her room until 5:30am. 
 We still only have Lucy's word on that. 
 Waylon's demeanour suggests a man buying cigarettes. 
 The night shift guy didn't remember any cuts on his cheek. 
 He doesn't look spooked. 
 Hardly like a guy that's just killed his girlfriend. 
 What does a man who buys cigarettes at 1am in the morning most want? 
 To smoke them. 
 Mmm. Sims, the cigarettes in the jacket, how many were smoked? 
 Only one. 
 And it's, what, a three-minute driving back to the motel? 
 Just long enough for that one smoke? 
 Yeah, and we know he went back there because Slim tripped over the Mercedes having just received a call at 1:37. 
 But he never smoked another one. 
 Can we then assume that he went back to the unit and he was killed between 1:00am and 1:37am? 
 By the same person who killed Holly. 
 All while Slim was asleep. 
 If Slim is telling the truth. 
 Mmm. And where is Ritchie Mathis in all this? 
 Well, he's already at the 'Frog and Cheetah'. 
 Well, according to Jesse James. 
 And Ray Nielson. 
 Nothing on Choosie? 
 The iCars are maintaining search patrols, but Gab called off the door-to-door at midnight. 
 Back into at first light. 
 Choosie! 
 Choosie! 
 Choosie! 
 Choosie! 
 Good luck. 
 Morning, Slim. 
 Do we really have to go through this again? 
 Let's go through it again. 
 You say you were asleep between 1:00 and 5:30am at which point Ritchie returned and woke you up. 
 Yes. 
 So, what time did Ritchie leave again? 
 I told you, about 12:45 I saw him get in a taxi. 
 We've been through this. 
 Really, detective, the taxi records show it. What's your point? 
 I want to know what Jesse was doing between 1:00 and 1:45am. 
 I passed out. 
 It happens when you're... 
 When you take drugs. 
 "I was passed out on a cocktail of methadone, alcohol and cannabis and don't remember anything, your Honour." 
 It's not the best alibi, Slim. 
 I don't need an alibi. 
 You had a relationship with Waylon Strings. 
 That's no secret. 
 How did you feel when it ended? 
 Not great. Who does? 
 But you stayed in the band. 
 Ever heard of 'Fleetwood Mac'. 
 I'm a musician. 
 I play in a band, or did. 
 Then he moved on to Holly. 
 That must have grated. 
 Detective, this is bordering on a personal attack. 
 My client is dealing with very distressing news. 
 Two of her band members have just been found dead. 
 Both of whom your client was unhappy with. 
 What about Lucy? 
 What about her? 
 She used to go out with Waylon. 
 I am aware of that. 
 Are you aware of how mad she was with him? 
 Were you actually planning on telling me? 
 I told you. 
 On stage. In front of 500 people. 
 So, now you know. 
 And what about Choosie, huh? 
 Is she part of your new plan? 
 She can come, too. 
 And how does Holly feel about that? 
 Mmm? 
 I didn't think so. 
 Look, we've always made things work. 
 I've made things work. 
 Christ, Waylon, she starts school next week. 
 Holidays. She can fly over. 
 To Nashville. 
 It might as well be the moon. 
 Choosie saw all this? 
 What do you expect, Luce? 
 Holly's on the verge of cracking it big time and I'm a part of that. 
 She needs me. 
 And me? 
 Where do I fit in? 
 I thought so. 
 It's always been about her. 
 Or whoever it is you're waking up to in the morning. 
 Well, I'm done with you, Waylon. 
 Want another coke? 
 (PHONE RINGS) 
 Breen. 
 We've got something. 
 And it might not be good. 
 I'm gonna show you something, and take your time to be sure, but is this familiar? 
 It's not Freddy. 
 That's not Choosie's bear? 
 It's similar, but no. 
 Where did you find it? 
 A storm water drain. 
 That's good news then, I suppose. 
 I'll have Carley take you back to the motel. 
 Screw that. You think I'm gonna sit around waiting? 
 I want to be looking. 
 We have 40 personnel on the ground and another 30 on their way from other districts. 
 We will find Choosie. 
 Is that a promise? 
 We will find her. 
 You can't promise me, can you? 
 We're doing everything we can. 
 I'm heading out to check progress on the station line. 
 Come with me. 
 Lucy. 
 Is there any reason Ritchie Mathis would hold a grudge against you? 
 No. Why? 
 Did he kill Waylon and Holly? 
 There's nothing to suggest he did. 
 In fact, as far as we can make out he wasn't even at the motel when the deaths occurred, but he was angry at both of them. 
 You think he took Choosie? 
 I can't discount it, but I can't think why. 
 Neither can I. 
 He wasn't the only one angry with them, though, was he? 
 No. We all were. 
 Let's go. 
 Where were you going with that? 
 Jesse James told me about an argument between Waylon and Lucy. 
 I'm done with you, Waylon. 
 No more. 
 Choosie watched this? 
 Yeah, and she's only five years' old. 
 God knows what's going through her head after hearing that. 
 You asked me a question before. 
 When Choosie arrived at the unit who answered the door? 
 What if it was no-one? 
 That you, babe? 
 You're suggesting Choosie put the guitar in the bath. 
 Well, in her mind Holly's the person taking her father away from her. 
 She's five. 
 Would she even know about the lethal danger of doing that? 
 She grew up around musicians. 
 Could she lift it, let alone heft it into the bath? 
 And if it's 5:30am Holly is already dead. 
 Well, Gina said between 1am and 6am. 
 Why would she take a bath at 5:30 in the morning? 
 She's a country singer. 
 They do weird things. 
 Or it's as you suggest, she enters. 
 She sees something frightening. 
 Then she's either running from something she did or running from something she saw. 
 The point is, are we looking for a lost child or a child in hiding? 
 Which leaves us with who killed Holly? 
 Who killed Waylon? 
 And where is Waylon's car? 
 And where is Ritchie Mathis? 
 (PHONE RINGS) 
 Hello. 
 Now two dead musos and a missing child. 
 Why don't you move back to the big smoke? It's a doddle down here. 
 I'll pass, thanks. 
 Of course. Too many ex-wives to contend with. 
 Probably safer in Brokenwood. 
 Right. We did that background on Waylon Strings. 
 Real name Warren Sanders. 
 No bad debts, drug charges, addictions or convictions. 
 Not very rock'n'roll at all. 
 Country. 
 And Ritchie Mathis. 
 Yes. 
 The guy is clean. 
 No flags of any kind, particularly no issues with kids. 
 Plus, the team have run those checks for you on the toll road cameras and traffic cams and that Mercedes hasn't come this way. 
 He may not have left town at all. 
 Have you thought about that? 
 Mmm. 
 Thanks. 
 (GRUNTS) 
 Where the hell is Ritchie Mathis? 
 Coffee? 
 OK. One more time. 
 OK. The Mercedes was there at 1:37am. 
 Ritchie returned to Jesse's unit... 
 Jesse. 
 ..some time after 5:00am. 
 No, no. Wake up. 
 Therefore, Ritchie probably took the Mercedes. 
 After he killed Waylon and Holly. 
 But he was at the 'Frog and Cheetah' between the hours of the time of death. 
 Well, not all of them. 
 There's a window on both bodies between 5am and 6am. 
 And our time line has him mooching about the motel around 5:45... 
 Keep out. 
 ..after Jesse kicked him out. 
 Yeah, and we know that Choosie left Lucy's unit after 5:30am, which means that Ritchie could have taken her. 
 But why? 
 Well, he said he wanted to teach them a lesson. 
 Really? Kidnapping? 
 It's a hell of a lesson. 
 Yeah. 
 And why would you kidnap a child after you'd killed the parent? 
 Was there something else going on in 'The Hole in the Wall Gang' that we didn't know about? 
 (PHONE RINGS) 
 Hello. 
 Celia, Detective Shepherd. 
 Um, look, I know you're probably down the line, but... 
 Oh, no, as a matter of fact we haven't left yet. 
 The hose pipe was the wrong size, so Rayleen is fitting the new one. 
 Do you mind if I pick your brains about something else? 
 Yeah, sure. You want me to come in? 
 No, I can pop up there. 
 Great, I'll put the coffee on.

 Hey, mister, money really does grow on trees. 
 Ritchie. 
 Yeah. 
 Ritchie Mathis. 
 Yeah. There's a Stetson. 
 No, Ritchie, no! 
 Stay with me, fella. 
 Don't go to sleep. Choosie. 
 Was Choosie with you? 
 What? 
 Did you take Choosie? 
 Talk to me, Ritchie. 
 Don't know what you're talking about. 
 Ambulance. 
 (SIRENS WAIL) 
 (RADIO CHATTER) 
 Under no circumstances is he to talk to anyone until I do. 
 Breen, get ready to go bush. 
 Please, take a seat. 
 How are you bearing up? 
 Sorry, dumb question. 
 I found this at the scene. 
 Do you think it could be from Choosie's bear? 
 I don't know. 
 But if it is it means that Choosie was in the car. 
 So you can see how it's important. 
 But what does Ritchie say? 
 He says she wasn't. 
 And do you believe him? 
 Ritchie is in a bad way. 
 Until we talk to him more thoroughly... 
 ..I'm tempted to believe this. 
 You're asking me to remember the eye colour of my daughter's Teddy bear? 
 Yes. 
 I want to say "yes" but if I say "yes" you might keep looking in the wrong place and then... 
 It's been over 24 hours. 
 When was the last time that Choosie would have ridden in Waylon's car? 
 A few days ago, maybe. 
 She liked that stupid car. 
 And what about the last time that you saw Choosie. 
 Did Freddy have two eyes? 
 If I hadn't let her go on her own. 
 Five minutes only, please. 
 Ritchie, this is Detective Sims. 
 Hi, Ritchie. 
 Looks like I screwed up. 
 Ritchie, I need to ask you again, and I can't stress enough how important this is. 
 But did you have Choosie in the car with you? 
 No. 
 I told you no. Why? 
 Why did you take Waylon's car? 
 I was drunk. 
 I can't remember much. 
 Can I see Jesse? 
 Not right now. A few more questions. 
 I found this in your jacket. 
 Does that jog your memory? 
 They killed the band. 
 And you wanted to kill their careers. 
 Something like that. 
 Is that what you meant when you told Jesse, "I'm going to teach them a lesson"? 
 Holly ripped that song off Jesse. 
 I know some breakfast DJs in the city. 
 I was on my way to give them a scoop, but I didn't make it. 
 (TYRES SCREECH) 
 Why didn't you take the tour van? 
 What better way than Waylon's precious bloody car? 
 He's gonna kill me. 
 Who? 
 Waylon, of course, and Holly. 
 I swear, I'll pay the money back. 
 When you went down to Holly's room to get Waylon's car, did you see Choosie? 
 No. 
 I swear I didn't see her. 
 Is she missing? 
 (ELECTRONIC BEEPS) 
 Detectives, please. 
 Do you reckon he was telling the truth? 
 Unfortunately, I do. 
 Oh, if that's the case we're none the wiser. 
 Oh, Rayls, it really hurts. 
 It hurts. Oh. 
 Hang on. 
 Oh. 
 Can I have some help, please? 
 Oh, god. I'm such an idiot. 
 So sorry. 
 Oh, hello, detective. 
 Sorry, can't stop. 
 What happened? 
 Hooking up the Toyota. 
 Oh! Oh! Rayls. 
 Reckon it's clean broken. 
 I hope she's OK. 
 You didn't make it for coffee. 
 Can I help? 
 No, no. Go to Celia. 
 That's your odd couple of country music fans, I take it? 
 There's nothing those fans don't know. 
 Ritchie entered the unit at 5:45am and took the keys. 
 Holly was already dead but he was too drunk to notice. 
 The sound of the CD playing would have covered the noise of the electricity arcing. 
 So, Waylon was already in the laundry. 
 Which means Ritchie didn't kill Holly or Waylon. 
 And he didn't see Choosie. 
 But if Ritchie's story is to be believed, the door to the unit was unlocked. 
 So, are we back to the theory that Choosie entered, saw Holly, freaked out and ran away? 
 Why didn't she just go back to her mum and get help? 
 Why? 
 Same reason as Ritchie. 
 She wants Holly alive to suffer the humiliation of being unmasked as a plagiarist. 
 But Slim, who says the phone woke him up? 
 There's a window there where he could have dealt to both Holly and Waylon. 
 Before he went on a bender? 
 Or Lucy Choo. 
 It's only her word of where she was and what Choosie was up to. 
 Senior. 
 Thanks. 
 Any word from Breen? 
 No. 
 The ESR have come up with a match on the lipstick that was on Holly and the mirror. 
 Blood Pink, like I thought. 
 Oh, so you're a lippy shade expert now. 
 Like I said, there's nothing those Holly Collins fans don't know. 
 Very hard to come by, apparently.

 I found her at Redmonds Hollow. 
 She won't tell me her name. 
 It's Choosie, isn't it? 
 Boy, are we glad to see you. 
 This must be Freddy. You know what? 
 I reckon I know where his eye is.

 How is she doing? 
 She's warmed up and smiling again. 
 So are you. 
 Thank you for everything. 
 We're very happy to have your little girl back. 
 Do you think she's up to a couple of questions? 
 Yeah. Choosie, this is Mr Shepherd. 
 Hello, Choosie. My name's Mike. 
 And like Sam here, I'm a detective. 
 Do you know what that is? 
 Someone who catches baddies. 
 Well, yes, that's part of my job. 
 But I also have to figure out mysterious things sometimes and something that is a bit of a mystery to me is how you ended up lost in the bush. 
 I fell out of my dad's car. 
 Is that how you got the bump on your head? 
 Do you know who was driving the car? 
 I thought it was Dad. 
 But it wasn't? 
 It was Ritchie. 
 Did he speak to you? 
 So, how did you end up in the car? 
 I wanted him to take me to Nashville. 
 And you thought he might leave without you? 
 So, you were hiding. 
 Am I in trouble? 
 No, not at all. 
 Your mum is just happy to have you home. 
 One more thing, Choosie. 
 Can you lift this guitar from that bed to that bed for me? 
 It's OK, you can stop now, Choosie. 
 Do you know what you've just done? 
 You've helped me solve part of a mystery. 
 (LAUGHTER) Here we go. 
 It's finally kicking in. 
 Oopsie. 
 Excuse me. 
 You are finally off. 
 This time, hopefully. 
 Back to the big smoke. 
 You know what they say, bad luck comes in these. 
 Don't say that, Ceils. God. 
 Nice flowers. 
 From Rayls. 
 Although I probably should have gotten her some. 
 Saved my butt yesterday. 
 You've bounced back. 
 The lipstick, Pink Panther? 
 Very good, detective. 
 Safe travels. 
 It's been a real pleasure meeting you. 
 Pink Panther. 
 Wasn't that Holly's favourite lipstick, as well? 
 Yes. 
 That's why I gave it to Ceils. 
 Make her feel a bit spesh. 
 Time to get her home. 
 Time to rebuild our lives after all the excitement. 
 And back to your mum. 
 Always. 
 Come on, Rayls. Enough gossip. 
 Goodbye, Detective. 
 Where did you put the car, Rayls? 
 I was just... 
 I haven't told her about Waylon yet. 
 I don't envy that. 
 It's so ironic. 
 She loved him to pieces, but he never really cared about her that much. 
 One sniff of success and he was ready to jump on a plane and forget about her forever. 
 So thoughtful how far fans will go to show their love. 
 Is that your phone, Rayls? 
 Oh, bloody mum. 
 Why did you change your ring tone? 
 Mothers, can't live with them. 
 Can't be born without them. 
 Was it something I said? 
 You get used to it. Excuse me. 
 It's all yours. 
 What you choose to do with it is up to you. 
 Stop! 
 Mike. 
 Stop! 
 What the hell? 
 Christ in a sidecar, Rayleen. 
 Are you alright, boss? 
 Let's go. 
 Rayleen, I don't know what the hell is going on in your head but I want you to let me out. 
 Rayleen! 
 Comms from BBC1, in pursuit of blue Toyota heading south on State Highway 17. 
 (SIREN WAILS) 
 Mike, we'll have her on Mickey's Pass. 
 Roger that. 
 Have the Riverstone team organise a reception party at Greenwood Junction. 
 Copy that, BB1. 
 I want you to stop, you hear me? 
 Oh, my god. 
 (MOOING) 
 Geez! 
 Oh, my god. 
 Argh! 
 Get that mad woman away from me. 
 Rayleen, enough! 
 How did you know? 
 An obsessive fan like you would know that their idol's favourite lipstick was Blood Pink, not Pink Panther. 
 I love her. 
 We all loved Holly, but we didn't want to kill her. 
 No. Celia. 
 More than anything. 
 When Holly said she was leaving New Zealand I knew Ceils would follow. 
 It's time for me to move to Nashville. 
 Couldn't have that. 
 Can't leave Mum, see. 
 Can't let Holly take my Ceils away. 
 So... 
 The water's still hot, babe. 
 (AMP HUMS) 
 What the hell? 
 No! 
 Do you want to hand it over? 
 Anything else? 
 We're calling Waylon.
