 Captain (over speaker) : The limu lipoa is actually a type of seaweed. 
 In fact, the waters of Waikiki feature over 200 species of marine plants. 
 The black stuff on the ocean floor is coral, and the white stuff-- well, that's sand. 
 Coming up on the port side, you'll see... 
 Just make sure you CC Legal on that memo. 
 No, I said  CC Legal. 
 Mom, look! 
 The rocks are so fuzzy! 
 I'm going to have to call you back. I'm on a submarine. 
 Mom, it's Nemo. 
 That fish looks like Nemo.

 Mom...

 Captain : Coast Guard, Coast Guard, this is the submarine  Atlantis.

 (moans) 
 Good morning, Lieutenant. 
 (moans) 
 Good morning, Commander. 
 You know, uh... 
 I think I owe you dinner. 
 Yeah. Somehow we just never... quite... make it to dinner. 
 We had dinner in Coronado. 
 No. We had reservations... 
 You know we, uh, both have the day off today. 
 We could have breakfast on the beach. 
 Or... 
 Or... 
 I think I'm vibrating. 
 No, I-I think I'm actually vibrating. 
 There goes your day off. 
 Danny : There's something different about you today. 
 You, uh, you get a new haircut? 
 No. 
 New cargo pants? 
 What was that? 
 What? 
 I believe you just smiled! 
 You-you almost appear to be happy. 
 You don't think I'm a happy person? 
 You know-- ha-- you know, I'm sure you have your moments, you know, like when  Guns & Ammo  puts out their holiday gift guide, or a Rambo retrospective comes on TV. 
 But when the governor calls us down to the ME's office on a Saturday, I ask you: what is it that you could be so happy about? 
 Oh, you had Grace this weekend. 
 Yeah. I just dropped her back off at Rachel's. 
 So just to recap: I got a broken knee, I got a daughter I barely get to see, now I work on Saturdays, okay? 
 So, life's grand, know what I mean? 
 It's good. 
 Gentlemen, thank you for coming. 
 Governor. 
 An 18-year-old girl's body was found off Waikiki this morning. 
 That's HPD's jurisdiction. 
 Not this time. 
 (ragtime piano playing) 
 Oh, that's right. 
 You haven't met Dr. Bergman yet.

 Max is a tactile thinker. 
 Playing music is part of his process. 
 Some people say he's a savant. 
 I think he's a genius.

 Edematous Airways. 
 Nice to meet you, too. 
 The victim exhibited pulmonary edema, petechial hemorrhaging, and froth in the airways. 
 Cause of death is definitely drowning. 
 (gasps) 
 Does that mean we're not dealing with a homicide? 
 No. It doesn't mean we're  not  dealing with a homicide. 
 Oh, sorry. 
 That was a double negative. 
 It means, it still could be a homicide. 
 See these linear contusions on her wrists? 
 They're antemortem. 
 Ligature marks. 
 Mean she was restrained. 
 That's right. 
 She has defensive wounds as well. 
 So she put up a fight. 
 Yes. 
 Also, hello. 
 I'm Max Bergman. 
 Hello, Max. 
 Yeah, hi, Max. 
 Uh, Governor, do we have an ID on the victim? 
 Her name is Amanda Reeves. 
 Her father's Michael Reeves, the U.S. Ambassador to the Philippines, and a very old friend. 
 Which is why I promised I'd put my two best people on it. 
 Okay, uh... 
 What are they doing in Hawaii? 
 They vacation here every year. 
 Thanks, Al. 
 Um... 
 (sighs) 
 The, uh... girls went to a movie last night, but they never made it home. 
 I'm sorry, you said girls? 
 Uh, as in more than one? 
 Oh! Sorry. 
 A-Amanda's sister, Robin, is still missing. 
 The Coast Guard sent out divers this morning, but, uh... there's no sign of her. 
 So Robin Reeves may still be alive. 
 Always wanted Amanda and Robin to have a.... 
 (deep breath) 
 ...normal upbringing, but it hasn't been easy. 
 So they were stationed with you at the Embassy in Manila? 
 Yeah. For the last two years. 
 Before that, it was, uh, Budapest. 
 Keeping the family together has always been... important to us. 
 Yeah. 
 Of course, growing up in foreign countries with a security detail shadowing your every move is not exactly an ideal childhood. 
 Did they, by chance, have a detail with them when they went out last night? 
 Well, in the Philippines it's one thing, but we've been coming to Hawaii since the girls were little. 
 I guess we just didn't think it was necessary. 
 They were just going to the movies. 
 Don't blame yourself. 
 We're going to find Robin. 
 We are. 
 We are. I promise. 
 That's quite a bit of firepower. 
 It's a Kimber 1911. 
 I prefer something with a little more kick. 
 Not exactly diplomatic security standard issue. 
 Which would make you... 
 Russell Ellison, security consultant. 
 I specialize in VIP and corporate protection. 
 In light of what happened to Ambassador Reeves, he called me in to bolster his detail. 
 So when did you get into town? 
 This morning. 
 And if you don't mind, I have a lot of work to do. 
 Aloha. 
 You know, it's possible that your daughters were targeted because of your ambassadorship. 
 Did you make any enemies during your time abroad? 
 I'm a representative of the United States in an unstable region of the world. 
 It comes with the territory. 
 How about in the Philippines itself? 
 The U.S. gives a lot of aid to that country. 
 Most of the population is grateful for our assistance. 
 Yeah, but not everybody appreciates the help. 
 I mean, there's always radical elements who resent our presence. 
 Michael, did any of them ever threaten you? 
 Office receives dozens of threats. 
 The security bureau keeps all of that on file. 
 Mrs. Reeves, you were a founding partner in Sowersby Financial. 
 Is it true that you recently sold your stake in that company? 
 Yes, but how is that relevant? 
 Well, because, ma'am, you just cashed out of Sowersby for over $12 million. 
 If we have that information, it's safe to assume that other people do, too. 
 What...? Are you saying Amanda's dead 'cause I have money? 
 I'm sorry, uh, ma'am, these high-profile cases are usually about money. 
 Then how come there hasn't been a ransom demand? 
 I don't know. 
 Oh! 
 Hi. 
 Yeah. 
 Um... Steve had to leave for work, and he told me I should just let myself out, so... 
 Um... You must be... 
 The sister. I'm Mary. 
 Yeah. 
 I'm just visiting from L.A. 
 Big night last night. 
 Hmm? 
 Old house. Thin walls. 
 Oh, God! 
 Yeah. You said that a lot. 
 It's embarrassing. 
 Don't sweat it. 
 I just broke up with my boyfriend, so I plan on having a lot of guys over soon. 
 So it'll be a fair fight. 
 Hey. 
 Hey. Checked with State. 
 No credible threats against the ambassador in the last three months. 
 Kono : Okay, so this doesn't add up-- why kill one girl and keep the other one alive? 
 Well, if it's a ransom attempt, it could be to show that they mean business. 
 HPD has a unit at the house. 
 Still no ransom call. 
 So we got no motive. 
 Okay, so we focus on how the girls were abducted. 
 75% of kidnappings are usually carried out by people the victims already knew. 
 We ran a background check on the ambassador's staff, and everyone seems clean. 
 What about the new guy? 
 That security consultant, Russell Ellison. 
 His story checks out. 
 Ambassador just flew him in from the mainland, and, uh, his plane touched down (cell ringing) after the girls were abducted. 
 McGarrett. 
 On our way. 
 Let's go, big guy. 
 Max : Just got back the toxicology report. 
 The victim had benzodiazepine in her blood. 
 You may be more familiar with its street name-- roofies. 
 Yeah, it's a date rape drug. 
 Yeah, it's not that often a girl gets roofied at the movies. 
 You could have told us this on the phone. 
 I don't trust phones. 
 Okay. Uh, Kono said that the daughters had a reputation for being, uh, party girls. 
 Do you have a black light? 
 Oh. It's called an ALS wand. 
 And I don't like people touching my equipment. 
 Can I just have the wand, please? 
 Fine. 
 Steve :  Zephyr Lounge. 
 It's a nightclub. 
 Just sent us a link to remotely access their closed-circuit feeds. 
 That's really good. 
 It's impressive. 
 Did you learn that in SEAL school? 
 Yeah, it's called using the lnternet. 
 People have been doing it since the early '90s. 
 You may have heard of it. 
 I wouldn't know. 
 I was still playing  Ms. Pac-Man. 
 Oh, yeah? 
 Yeah. 
 Ever make it to the double pretzel level? 
 Triple banana, bitch. 
 You're a liar. 
 No, I'm not. 
 All right, give me last night's front door and start at midnight and roll backwards. 
 Danny : Right there. Right there. 
 Whoa, whoa. Okay, roll forward.

 Hey. Two Longboards. 
 Danny : What are you doing? 
 Breaking for beers? 
 This guy's just abducted two girls. 
 His radar is going to be up. 
 He sees us before we see him, he's going to bolt. 
 So let's just have a couple of beers, get eyes on the place and relax. 
 This place has got eyes on you. 
 Would you focus, please? 
 Just... just once. 
 Just focus. 
 Okay, wait a minute. 
 Let me ask you a question. 
 Go ahead. 
 Two very attractive ladies are eye-humping you-- uh, respectably-- and-and what, nothing? 
 Nothing? I mean, what, should I check for a pulse? 
 You alive? Hello. 
 What is that? 
 What is that smile? 
 What smile? 
 That stupid smile. 
 What is it with you today? 
 Huh? 
 You're imagining things. 
 Oh, I'm imagining things. 
 That's right. 
 Wait a minute. 
 Wait a minute. 
 Some detective I am. 
 You got into some Barry White last night, didn't you? 
 Huh? Am I right or am I right? 
 You're very perceptive. 
 Thank you. 
 Take a look at Casanova over there-- 6:00. 
 Danny : That's our boy. 
 Let me tell you what I'd like to do. 
 If that was my daughter, I would bust every single one of his fingers one at a time. 
 (chuckles) 
 Oh, God. 
 Thank you for the excuse. 
 Danny : Excuse me. Excuse me. 
 Whoa. Put the drink down. 
 It's time for you to go to the bathroom. 
 Dude. 
 Who do you think you are? Huh? 
 Steve : What's that? 
 Who do I think I am? 
 I think I might be a guy who just saw another guy put something in a lady's drink. 
 I don't know what you're talking about. 
 You don't? 
 I didn't put anything in her drink. 
 Danny : You didn't put anything... 
 Then, drink it. 
 What? 
 Drink it. Come here. 
 Drink... listen to me. 
 Drink that drink, or I'm going to bust your teeth and pour it down your throat, okay? 
 I would drink it. 
 Let me help you. 
 Come on.

 Good job. 
 Okay, let's go loverboy.

 Robin Reeves. 
 What'd you do with her? 
 What? 
 Great. Now he's deaf. 
 Where is she? 
 Where is Robin Reeves? 
 Here's your rap sheet here. 
 You got credit card fraud, corruption of a minor, statutory rape, and now you graduated to murder. 
 Congratulations. 
 (chuckling): Murder? 
 Yeah. 
 What are you talking about? 
 Well, they found Amanda Reeves' body this morning. 
 I didn't kill that girl. 
 No? Well, you better know who did, then. 
 Okay. Okay. 
 I did slip those girls a roof last night. 
 Why those girls? 
 Why'd you pick them? 
 I just did what I was told. 
 But they were alive when I handed them off to Kang. 
 Who's Kang? 
 The one who set me up with the job. 
 Said he'd give me five grand for every girl I brought him. 
 What does he do with the girls? 
 I get paid to supply the girls, not to ask questions. 
 Okay, so how do we find Kang? 
 I don't know, honestly. I... 
 He never even told me his last name. 
 I don't even know his phone number. 
 How do you deliver the girls to Kang? 
 How does that happen? 
 He leaves a van parked in one of the lots. 
 Okay, go on. 
 I put the girls in the back, take the van to Ala Wai, and I park it by the canal. 
 The next day, it's back in the parking lot with five grand in the glove box and instructions for the next drop-off. 
 So that girl you were going to drug tonight-- is she your next delivery? 
 Yeah. 
 Yeah, I was... supposed to get her there by 1:00. 
 That's less than an hour.

 Hang tight, Kono.

 Chin : Bravo team, target's turning southeast on Kuhio. 
 Man (over radio) : Copy that. 
 Steve : Kuhio Avenue-- it's a red-light district at night. 
 Yeah, s*x trade, kidnapped girls. 
 It's got to be forced prostitution. 
 Yeah. 
 Teenagers like Amanda and Robin are prime targets. 
 Man (over TV) : You know, Tamara, the Hawaii Chair wasn't designed just for home. 
 I mean, after all, for some of us, at least 40 hours of our week is spent sitting behind a desk at the office. 
 So, to see what office workers think of the Hawaii Chair, we sent Erin Lee to work. 
 Hi. I'm Erin Lee with... 
 Seriously?

 Woman : Oh, my gosh. This is amazing. 
 Man : That feels great on my abs. 
 Woman : I can really feel this working. 
 Oh, my God!

 Erin : ...using the computer, balancing books or filing paperwork.

 Put the box back, okay? 
 It's evidence. 
 Evidence of what? 
 Something Dad was investigating. 
 A case he was working on. 
 He wanted me to find it. 
 Why? 
 Mary, please... do me a favor and just put the box back for now, okay? 
 Okay, okay, I will. 
 Tell me you're putting the box back. 
 Relax. I will.

 Probably not.

 Okay. Close quarters with an unknown number of hostiles.

 Five-nine, local girl, black top, black hot pants. 
 She's one of ours, so look sharp.

 She's not here. 
 Steve : Robin Reeves-- where is she? 
 I never see that girl. 
 Chin : Well, seeing as you're not even bothering to look, maybe you'll remember that she was with her sister Amanda, and maybe you'll want to know that she's dead now.

 Yeah, sure. 
 (indistinct radio transmission) 
 She ordered the kidnapping of the Reeves sisters, but it wasn't for the prostitution ring. 
 She tell you where Robin is? 
 Doesn't know. 
 According to her, the Reeves girls never even passed through here. 
 A private buyer paid her 50,000 to abduct them and hand them over. 
 Said the kidnapping was a freelance job. 
 So it had nothing to do with s*x trade. 
 Someone was targeting them specifically. 
 You get a name on a buyer? 
 All she had was the phone number she used to communicate with the guy. 
 Said she was paid by wire. 
 This will help. 
 How'd you get her to talk? 
 Told her the dog would be put down once she went to lockup. 
 Promised I'd find it a home. 
 If  she cooperated. 
 What? 
 It's not like it's the dog's fault. 
 Chin :  So I ran the phone number on our private buyer. 
 Turns out, the calls were made from a disposable cell phone. 
 Which is untraceable. 
 That's right. 
 But I was able to pull the call logs. 
 And get this: since the Reeves sisters went missing, three calls were placed from that cell phone to the ambassador's private number. 
 So you think that he's somehow involved in his own daughter's disappearance? 
 No. 
 No, this is a kidnap and ransom. 
 Yeah, they're calling the ambassador to make demands. 
 That's why he brought Ellison in after the girls went missing. 
 Ellison, the security consultant. 
 I will bet you he's not a security consultant. 
 That guy is a K&R specialist. 
 What's K&R? 
 STEVE, DANNY and CHIN: Kidnap and ransom. 
 It's a type of insurance. 
 Look, if the policyholder gets abducted, the company comes in, they pay the ransom and they supervise the exchange with the kidnappers. 
 And these guys got a tendency to obstruct police investigations. 
 So, if Ellison is handling the drop, that explains why the ambassador lied to us. 
 Is your husband home? 
 We uh, we need to have a word. 
 No, I... he had to step out for a meeting. 
 With Mr. Ellison? 
 I don't know. 
 What's going on? 
 Mrs. Reeves, we know that the kidnappers have been in communication with your husband. 
 He hired Russell Ellison to broker the deal, isn't that right? 
 Sarah. 
 Sarah, if you know something, you have to tell them. 
 I'm so sorry I lied to you. 
 Last call came in an hour ago, and the man on the end said that if we paid the money, we'd get Robin back. 
 Okay, so your husband and Ellison have gone to pay the ransom? 
 Please, I just want my daughter back. 
 Sarah :  So, as soon as the kidnappers made contact, 
 Michael called Mr. Ellison. 
 He flew in with the money. 
 He monitored all the calls. 
 He told Michael exactly what to do and say. 
 Did your husband say where the transaction was taking place? 
 No, no. Mr. Ellison wouldn't let him give me any details. 
 Did Ellison ask you to lie? 
 He said involving the police would only put Robin in more danger. 
 (cell phone ringing) 
 Excuse me. 
 Yeah? 
 I just traced the money trail for that private buyer who paid for the abduction of the Reeves sisters. 
 Uh-huh. 
 The payment was wired from a bank in the Philippines. 
 Chin : The account belongs to a Carlos Bagoyo. 
 Known member of the National Liberation Front, operational in rural Luzon. 
 They bombed a military base there in '08. 
 Lately they've taken to targeting U.S. troops within the country. 
 Of course they have. 
 Because we support the democratically-elected government that keeps them out of power. 
 Doesn't sound like they'd be interested in a ransom. 
 They're not. 
 They didn't kidnap his daughters for money, this is political. 
 If they're targeting the ambassador, he must have something they want. 
 Yeah. 
 And he just dropped his security detail to go meet with them. 
 Hey. 
 Listen, all the cars in the DSB motor pool have vehicle transponders, okay? 
 I need a location on the car the ambassador left in. 
 Government plates. It's him. 
 Tires are still warm. 
 They can't have gone too far. 
 Ellison probably sent the ambassador in solo to make the swap, but he'll be nearby monitoring with a tac team to make sure it doesn't bad. 
 And you know what? 
 I may have a way to figure out where he's running surveillance from. 
 Yeah, I figured you would. 
 You're gonna like this. 
 (cell phone ringing) 
 Was wondering when you were gonna call. 
 You get in late last night? 
 I actually haven't been home yet. 
 Interesting. 
 No, no, it's not what it sounds like. 
 I caught a high-priority case. 
 Okay, why am I getting the feeling that you're about to ask me for another favor? 
 Listen, I'll make it up to you, all right? 
 We'll finally get that dinner, and you'll get to taste the best steak on the island. 
 Who you talking to? 
 All right, you got yourself a deal. 
 What do you need? 
 PACOM has a satellite dedicated to Honolulu harbor. 
 Can you use it to run a scan on radio traffic? 
 Yeah, what am I looking for? 
 Uh, spread spectrum signal in the 400 MHz range. 
 Type used by high-end surveillance gear. 
 All right, one sec. 
 Thanks, Cath. 
 Oh, Catherine. 
 I should've known. 
 That's who you were getting right with last night. 
 That's stunning detective work. 
 Well done. 
 You know, it's amazing. 
 Now, she-she catches bad guys for you and she sleeps with you. 
 Does she cook, too? 
 Yeah, she does. 
 She's a great cook. 
 Man : Roger that. We've got eyes on the northern avenue of approach. 
 What's your status? 
 All right, I think I got a hit on your frequency. 
 I'm tying you in right now. 
 Ellison : Overwatch on Reeves is good. 
 We're standing by. 
 All right, that's our boy. 
 Can you get a vector on the signal source? 
 All right, the west end of the dock. 
 It's coming from a shipping container. 
 What are you doing? 
 Lower your weapons! 
 Right now! Lower your gun! 
 You can't come in here. 
 You're gonna get this girl killed. 
 We're gonna get this girl killed? 
 Hey! 
 You obstructed our investigation! 
 Now unless your men are ready to shoot a couple of cops, tell them to holster their weapons now. 
 Right now, buddy. 
 Where's the ambassador? 
 He's in position for the drop. 
 Pull him out now. 
 With all due respect, my team specializes in these situations. 
 We want to get Robin home to her family. 
 Of course you do, because if you don't, your firm is on the hook for six million, right? 
 The man who kidnapped the ambassador's daughters is a part of a Filipino terrorist group. 
 Sir, they just arrived. 
 This is not about cash, gentlemen. 
 They lured him in. 
 Steve : Look at that, Robin is not with them. 
 Patch me into the ambassador. 
 Ellison : All right, listen, they're here. 
 I want you to be calm and do exactly as we already discussed. 
 You know who I am? 
 Carlos Bagoyo. 
 You're an operative of the NLF, responsible for the Zamboanga bombings that killed 78 people. 
 I see you read your security briefs. 
 Where is she? 
 Where's my daughter? 
 She's nearby. 
 When we get what we want, we will release her. 
 You didn't come all this way for my money, did you? 
 I'm afraid not, Ambassador. 
 We came for you. 
 What do you want? 
 Your country sends military aid to the Philippine regime. 
 You put guns in the hands of soldiers that kill our sons and brothers. 
 I don't understand. 
 There's a U.S. shipment of M-4 machine guns en route to Manila. 
 You're gonna tell me where they are right now and we're gonna use those weapons to take our country back. 
 I don't have that kind of information. 
 As ambassador, you coordinate military aid with the State Department, which means you have access to the classified server. 
 Now if you ever want to see your daughter alive again, log in. 
 Steve : All right, he finds out where that shipment is, he can send a team in to hijack it. 
 We cannot let him get to those weapons. 
 Tell the perimeter team to gear up. 
 Wait a minute. 
 What are you doing? 
 We're running out of options. 
 We gotta move in. 
 We don't need to do anything. 
 You need to pull your men out so my partner and I can clean up your mess. 
 Move out now. 
 I'm not gonna tell you again! 
 Come on. 
 Your wife already lost one daughter. 
 Are you prepared to tell her your other child died because you wouldn't do what was asked? 
 Ambassador, this is Commander McGarrett. 
 Stay calm, listen. 
 Tell them that you're willing to cooperate, but first you need to see your daughter. 
 We cannot move in until we know where she is, you understand? 
 Fingerprint and password, Ambassador, now! 
 Please trust me. 
 Do as I ask you. 
 Tell Carlos you're willing to cooperate, but first you need to see Robin. 
 Ambassador, do it, please. 
 You're asking me to commit treason against my country. 
 And I will do as you ask, but not until I know she's safe. 
 I want to see Robin. 
 (speaks Tagalog) 
 She's on her way. 
 They're bringing Robin in. 
 We need to get a visual. 
 You're kidding me. 
 No, I'm not kidding. 
 Come here. Look, this one controls the camera feed, the joystick is for pans and zoom, okay? 
 It's just like  Ms. Pac-Man. 
 It's very easy. 
 They're holding the ambassador on dry dock number seven. 
 And the daughter? 
 She's not on-site, but Bagoyo has just agreed to provide proof of life. 
 We think he's holding her in a nearby location. 
 As soon as we get eyes on Robin, we can move in. 
 Okay, we got a boat coming in. 
 Kono : Got her. 
 All right, that's us. 
 We're going, Danny. 
 Okay, I'll just be here in the penalty box. 
 We still clear? 
 Roger that. 
 Daddy! 
 Robin. 
 Sweetie. 
 Go. 
 Okay, hold up, hold up. 
 You got two at the south entrance. 
 One of them's making the rounds, coming your way right now. 
 He's coming up right behind you. 
 He'll be on you in about ten seconds. 
 Wait for it. 
 Now, now. 
 Oh! 
 Bagoyo : That's enough. 
 No, no, no, no, please, please?! 
 Ambassador, you've seen your daughter. 
 Now log in. 
 My patience is wearing thin, Ambassador. 
 Do it or she dies. 
 Robin? 
 It's okay. 
 You guys okay? 
 Yeah. 
 (grunts) 
 (grunting) 
 All right. 
 Listen, I'm man enough to know when I'm wrong. 
 Thank you. 
 You both have great instincts, and if you ever consider coming down to the private sector, you should give me a call. 
 Men with your skill sets deserve to be compensated. 
 I know. 
 Well, thank you very much. 
 I totally agree. 
 Oh, what are you doing? 
 (handcuffs clicking) 
 I'm getting compensation. 
 You obstructed a criminal investigation. 
 That is an arrestable offense. 
 Ellison : Well, you and I both know that the charges will never stick. 
 Yeah, maybe not, but it's going to take your firm at least 24 hours to get a lawyer here from Los Angeles. 
 I'm gonna make sure that you spend that time in jail. 
 Book him, Danno. 
 You know, I got to be honest. 
 I actually didn't mind that one. 
 Really? 
 Yeah. 
 Move. 
 (sighs) 
 You saved a girl's life today. 
 Just doing the job you hired me for. 
 Maybe so, but I made a promise to a friend and... you let me keep it. 
 Thank you. 
 Hey, you okay? 
 Yeah. 
 ♪ ♪ 
 Okay, to, uh, let me see-- well, how about this? 
 To finally getting around to dinner. 
 Yes. 
 Cheers. 
 Cheers. 
 Mmm. 
 All right, well, I don't know about the food, but the view here is amazing. 
 How do you like your steak? 
 Bloody. 
 That's my kind of girl. 
 Think it'll be ready in a minute. 
 You know what? 
 What? 
 Make it medium. 
 Oh, oh, hold on a second. 
 Yeah, yeah. 
 Aah!
