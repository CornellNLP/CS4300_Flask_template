 Man 1 : Fire to One, this is Castle requesting an update. Over. 
 Man 2 : One. Commander McGarrett has the prisoner secure. Over. 
 You know what's funny. 
 You don't look Hawaiian. 
 You're gonna tell us everything. 
 But you were born there, weren't you? 
 Every terrorist cell you and Victor helped arm, every supplier you've worked with, all your trafficking associates, everyone you've ever sold weapons to. 
 Chasing my brother and I around the world for five years, like a little doggy looking for a bone. 
 You don't think we'd do our homework on you? 
 (phone ringing) 
 (Velcro pulls apart) 
 You should get that. 
 You don't speak to your father nearly enough. 
 (phone continues ringing) 
 Dad. 
 Man : Hey, Champ. 
 You all right? 
 Who are these people, Steve? 
 Now I know where you get it from. 
 You've got a tough old man here. 
 Steve, we both have something to lose here. 
 So listen to me very carefully. 
 I'm offering you a trade. 
 Your father for my brother. 
 All things considered, I'd say it's more than generous, wouldn't you? 
 You're smart enough to know that's never gonna happen. 
 I appreciate the compliment. 
 Are you smart enough? 
 Steve : Come on, Victor. 
 You know how this works. 
 We don't negotiate with terrorists. 
 Make an exception. 
 Ghost to One. I triangulated their cell signal. 
 The convoy's ten miles west of your position. 
 I'm not gonna negotiate like this. 
 Oh, are we negotiating now? 
 You kill him, you get nothing. 
 John : Give me the phone. 
 Please. 
 I can get him to help you. 
 He'll listen to me. 
 He's my son. 
 Listen to me, Champ. 
 Dad, I'm gonna get you out of there, all right? 
 Don't you worry about it. 
 I'm sorry that I lied to you. 
 What? Lied to me about what, Dad? 
 What are you talking about? 
 I love you, Son. 
 I didn't say it enough. 
 Whatever these people want, Steve, don't give it to them. 
 Don't you give it to them! 
 Dad? Dad?! 
 No more games! 
 I'm taking my brother now! 
 I swear to God, I will hunt you down and I will kill you. 
 Hey. Boom. 
 Man : This is Transport. 
 We're under attack. 
 Taking rocket and small arms fire... 
 (yelling) 
 Everybody, move it! Move! 
 (indistinct shouting) 
 Sarge! Sir! 
 Come on! 
 Come on! Go! 
 (indistinct radio dispatch) 
 (grunting): Come on! 
 Get down! 
 (indistinct shouting) 
 Man down! Man down! 
 Watch your cover! Move! 
 Quick! Quick! Quick! 
 Quick! Watch it. 
 Men, move out! 
 Come here. 
 (bullets ricocheting) 
 (indistinct shouting) 
 (both grunting) 
 (grunts) 
 Come on. Come on. 
 Come here. 
 (man shouting in Korean) 
 No! No! No! 
 Get down! 
 (groaning) 
 (gunfire continues) 
 No! No! Don't do it! 
 Put it down! 
 (coughing) 
 Come on, Anton. 
 Come on. 
 Come on, Anton. 
 (panting) 
 No! No! No! 
 (sighs) 
 (phone ringing) 
 (Velcro pulls apart) 
 (panting) 
 (phone beeps on) 
 Victor : What happened? 
 Victor... 
 Listen. 
 Put Anton on the phone. 
 (panting) 
 My brother's dead, isn't he? 
 Victor, listen. 
 Isn't he?! 
 Then so is your father. 
 (gun chamber clicks) 
 (gunshot) 
 No!

 ♪ Hawaii Five-O 1x17 ♪ 
Pilot 
 Original Air Date on September 20, 2010 
 Man : Honolulu approach. Reach 717. 
 Level at 3,000. 
 Man : 717, turn left zero-one-zero, maintain 3,000 until established on approach. 
 Man : How long since you've been home? 
 It's been a while. 
 Man : Sir, I've got a call coming in for you from the governor of Hawaii. 
 Commander? 
 Governor. 
 Thanks for agreeing to see me. 
 I am so sorry about your loss. 
 Is this about the investigation? 
 Yes. We have alerts across all the islands. 
 You won't find Victor Hesse with roadblocks and search warrants. 
 He's gone underground until he can find a safe way to leave the island. 
 Now why am I here? 
 I'd like to help you get what you came back here for. 
 Governor : Let's walk. 
 Your father's death was a wake-up call to me and every law enforcement agency in Hawaii, which is why I'm putting together a task force, and I want you to run it. 
 You don't even know me. 
 I know your résumé. 
 Annapolis. 
 Five years, Naval Intelligence. 
 Six with the SEALS. 
 Your superiors say that you are the best that they have ever seen. 
 Let me stop you right there. 
 I've been tracking Victor Hesse for five years. 
 If he was bold enough to surface, I promise you he already has an exit strategy planned, and he knows I know it, which means, I can barely afford the hour it's gonna take to bury my father, let alone stand here talking to you. 
 Excuse me. 
 I can help you find this son of a bitch. 
 With full immunity and means. 
 Your task force will have full blanket authority to go after guys like Hesse and get them the hell off my island. 
 Your rules, my backing, no red tape. 
 And I promise you, Commander, what you see with me is what you get. 
 Here's what I see. 
 An election year coming up, and a politician who needs the PR, who's willing to do whatever it takes-- including bringing me down here to Pearl Harbor, where my grandfather was killed, so I might feel some kind of obligation to fulfill my family destiny. 
 Is that about right, Governor? 
 None of those things make me feel less responsible. 
 I knew your father, Commander. 
 This is personal for me, too. 
 Pass. 
 All right. 
 Here's my private number. 
 Please think it over. 
 Thanks. 
 Man : She's a smart lady, that one. 
 Steve McGarrett, right? 
 I know you. 
 You'd better. Chin Ho Kelly. 
 Oh. Chin Ho Kelly. 
 Kahuku High School. 
 You were a great quarterback. 
 Oh, that's very kind of you to say, considering you were the one that broke all my records. 
 Oh, that was a long time ago. 
 I heard you became a cop. 
 I worked with your father in the Seventh. 
 He taught me everything I know about wearing a badge. 
 Looks like you moved on to greener pasture. 
 Well, let's just say, the Honolulu PD and I had a disagreement over my job description. 
 But your father understood. 
 He was very good to me after I was let go. 
 He stayed my friend, and I know that cost him something. 
 I only wish there was some way I could pay him back. 
 But now that you're here, maybe you can do something. 
 What do you mean? 
 I hear, the chief of police put a  haole  on your father's murder investigation. 
 Word is, he's fresh meat from the mainland, which means he has no clue how this island works. 
 Man :  No, it's perfect. 
 But I've been on hold so long, I forgot who I was talking to. 
 I need a warrant write-up for a surveillance wire on a suspect in connection to the John McGarrett murder. 
 Suspects name is Doran. 
 Fred Doran. 
 D-O-R-A-N. 
 (gate opening) 
 Yeah, that's terrific. 
 Thank you. 
 (gate squeaking) 
 Hi, Daddy. 
 Oh... oh! 
 Thank you. 
 It was a good hug. 
 Who, uh... Who's that? 
 Mr. Hoppy. 
 Stan bought him for me for the animal show-and-tell. 
 Oh, good old Step Stan. 
 He's very cute. 
 Not as cute as you, though. 
 We'd better go. 
 We don't want Mr. Hoppy to be late for his first day of school, do we? 
 No. 
 That's right. All right. 
 Where are you going? 
 You driving? 
 Hmm. 
 Come on, let's go this way. 
 You want to drive? 
 You can't drive. 
 You're too little. 
 Let's go. You're making me dizzy. Come on. 
 Hey, look at... 
 What's that? 
 Okay. What are you doing? What are you looking at over there? 
 Let's go. We got to go. 
 We're gonna be late for school. 
 John :  I love you, son. 
 (gunshot) 
 (wings fluttering) 
 (door creaks) 
 Listen to me, Champ... 
 (echoes) 
 John (on tape) : I can't continue this investigation into the police department from the inside. 
 I don't trust the people I work with. 
 So I'm gonna have to do this on my own. 
 It's all about the key. 
 I just don't know what it's for. 
 (door closes) 
 I have only been able to find two source... 
 (turns tape recorder off) 
 You! Hands up! Don't move! 
 Who are you? 
 Who are you? 
 I am Detective Danny Williams... 
 Lieutenant Commander Steve McGarrett! 
 This is my father's house. 
 Put your weapon down right now. 
 (both shouting) 
 Show me your I.D.! 
 You show me your I.D.! Right now! 
 I'm not putting my gun down. 
 Neither am I. 
 Use your free hand, take out your I.D. 
 Please, after you. 
 At the same time? 
 At the same time? 
 Yeah, at the same time. 
 What, like, on the count of three? 
 Sure. Okay, three's good. 
 One... two... three. 
 Listen, uh, I'm really sorry about your father, but you can't be here right now. 
 This is an active crime scene. 
 Doesn't seem that active. 
 I can't share any information with you. 
 Hesse wasn't here alone when my father was murdered. 
 Someone was sitting at the desk in the study-- there was a space clear for a 13-inch laptop and my father hated computers. 
 I'm gonna ask you again-- you got to leave. 
 You got it. 
 And you can leave the box-- that is evidence. 
 You know that. 
 I came with this. 
 No, you didn't come with it. 
 I see the dust void it left right here on the counter-- what's in the box? 
 How long you been with the Honolulu PD? 
 None of your business. 
 What are you, Barbara Walters? 
 No, it is my business if you're investigating my father's death. 
 I am, and I'd like to get back to that, so the sooner you leave, the sooner I can. 
 Anything you say. 
 Leave the box or get arrested, all right? 
 You gonna call for backup? 
 An ambulance. 
 Thank you. 
 Don't thank me yet. 
 What are you doing? 
 Uh, yeah, Governor Jameson, please? 
 Tell her it's Steve McGarrett. 
 Oh, please. 
 Jameson (on speaker) : Commander, Governor Jameson here. 
 What can I do for you? 
 (Williams mumbles) 
 Governor, I'll take the job. 
 Well, let's just say I found something that changed my mind. 
 No, no, no, immediately. 
 I'll transfer to the reserves, and I'll run your task force. 
 Wha... 
 What, right now? 
 Okay. 
 (Jameson speaking indistinctly) 
 "I, Steven J. McGarrett, do solemnly declare upon my honor and conscience that I will act at all times to the best of my ability and knowledge in a manner befitting an officer of the law." 
 Thank you, Governor. 
 Now it's my crime scene. 
 ♪ ♪ 
 I swung by your precinct, spoke to your captain. 
 He said you requested a wire be put on someone named Fred Doran. 
 Tell me about it. 
 Come in. 
 (door closes) 
 This your kid? 
 Yeah, that's stunning detective work. 
 You don't actually let her... stay here with you, do you? 
 What are you, uh,  Nanny 911? 
 So, what do you know about this guy... Doran? 
 Oh, but surely, you don't need my help, right? 
 Enlighten me. 
 He's a suspected arms dealer. 
 Two years Maui Correctional for weapons possession. 
 He's currently a person of interest in an unrelated homicide. 
 The weapon was never found. 
 So, what's he got to do with my father's case? 
 When I ran a ballistics comparison to the bullet that killed your dad, I got a hit to the Doran investigation. 
 See, I think the first thing that Hesse did when he got on the island was hook up with Doran and get a gun. 
 And maybe Doran still knows where he is, so let's go talk to him. 
 Whoa, whoa, whoa. 
 Excuse me. 
 Are you suffering from dementia? 
 This is no longer my case. 
 The captain said you transferred in from New Jersey six months ago, so your eye's still fresh. 
 You know, I appreciate it, but my psych eval's not for six weeks. 
 Fold-out bed, no ring on your finger. 
 You obviously moved here to be close to your daughter. 
 Which means in between visits, all you got is your job and you take pride in it. 
 That's what I'm looking for. 
 Yeah, but you know what? 
 It's guys like you, they think they know how to do everything better, and that only makes my job harder. 
 You got no choice, Detective. 
 Governor gave me jurisdiction-- 
 I'm making you my partner. 
 We're gonna get along great.

 I take it your marriage didn't end too well. 
 No. 
 It would have had my ex not remarried and dragged my daughter to this pineapple-infested hellhole. 
 You don't like the beach? 
 I don't like the beach. 
 Who doesn't like the beach? 
 I like, uh, cities, you know. 
 Skyscrapers, no tsunamis, no jellyfish.

 Can I swim? 
 You don't know how to swim. 
 I know how... I swim-- I swim for survival, not for fun.

Out of the car right now. Hands behind your head. We're clear. (rumbling) We got movement over here. Go ahead. Go ahead. I got you. (refugees murmuring) (speaking native language) Listen, Danny. (crowd murmuring) (siren chirps) Ni hao, Chen-Chi. (gasps) Mama! Sang Min :  Getting them out  of China is easy. Paying for it-- that's the hard part. (click) Chin : Laser Audio Surveillance. You don't need a wire to get a confession out of your  hupo  ass. I'm going to sue you for entrapment. And when I'm done collecting, I'm going to find that little hottie you sent in here, and this time, I'm going to be less of a gentleman. (groans) Sorry, boss. I didn't see anything. You didn't see anything?! Son of a bitch hit me! You want to file a report, you're going to need a witness. Do you want to file a report? I want to go to jail now. Where is he? Where's Hesse? What about your wife and kid? You know where they are? I do. She's getting her nails done on Kalakaua Avenue. And your boy is at his private school in Diamond Head. You know, I wonder what he's gonna think when he finds out that Daddy takes kids just like him and puts them on the street to be pumped full of black tar heroin, and then sold to strangers like animals. You're going to jail. That part's not up for negotiation. Your family is about to lose a husband and a father. In my eyes, now they're your victims, too. The trouble is, the law doesn't see it that way. Your wife-- she's from Rwanda. She'll be sent back. They both will. If they're lucky, they'll make it to a refugee camp. And your son? Seven's old enough to hold a gun for the Hutu Militia. I can prevent all that. But I don't help people who don't help me. What kind of cops are you? The new kind. Okay. Okay. Steve :  Sang Min put Hesse and Etienne on a cargo ship headed for China-- The Emma Karl. Governor Jameson (over phone) :  Steve, do not even think of... Steve :  Governor, you wanted a task force that would do whatever was necessary. You promised me immunity and means. No, no. Not...  Not  to provoke a diplomatic incident by boarding a Chinese freighter headed for international waters. If China is caught smuggling a terrorist, trust me,  they won't say a word. I did my job, Governor. I found Hesse. Now you do yours. Tell the Coast Guard to block the port. That ship is not going anywhere. (screeching violin ringtone plays) Son of a bitch. Yeah. Rachel. Rachel, don't start with me. I left you two messages, telling you you need to pick her up. Don't tell me you had to change your plans. You send a driver for her half the time anyway. (tires squealing) I can't... I can't do that right now. I'm in the middle of something. Please stop for a second. Can you just do me one favor? Just tell Gra... Tell Grace Danno loves her, all right? Okay. Gracie was three, she'd try to say my name, and all that she could say was Danno. That's all that came out. Danno. Okay? That's it? That's it. That's it. It's cute. Shut up. Why-Why... Why can't I think it's cute? Don't... Because. Because I don't need you thinking anything about us. It's between me and my daughter. All right. (grunting, tires screeching) (groaning) There it is--  The Emma Karl. Taking off. How do you want to do this?! (gun cocking) Right. Hold on. (engine revving) (tires squealing) All right... All right. All right! Cover me. I'm gonna find Hesse. Go! Go! (shouting in the distance) (grunting) (gasps) (groans) (grunts) (groans) (clicking empty) (groans) (gasps) (grunting) (groans, grunts, coughs) (grunts) (groans) (sighs) (panting) There's something you should know about your brother. What about him? He died the same way you did. (grunts, gasps) (panting, sighs) (groans) Put your hands behind your back. Don't make me shoot you again. (grunts) Steve : Hey. Get the Coast Guard to find that body. What do you want me to do with this one? Book 'em, Danno. What did I tell you about that? Where are you trying to go? Where are you...? Where? Where? Where? Go ahead. Do you want me to shoot you? Stop. Just stop. (indistinct conversation) How's this on the other side? Hey. What, uh... What is this? Three nights at the Kahala Hotel. Look, I know you're gonna say no... Yeah. You're right, I'm gonna say no. What is it with you and my living arrangements? Gracie's coming over this weekend, right? Yeah. Okay. So, I hear this place has a pool, you can swim with the dolphins. Just take it. Hey. Oh, you look, uh... You look really bad. Thank you. You're welcome. Thank you. Kono : Okay, guys, honestly, I think we need a name. Steve : A name? What kind of name? What are you talking about? Yeah, like, something to call ourselves. What do you think? Why do we need a name? Kono :  Because we're gonna be working together, and it'd be cool. I got it. A'ohe hana nui ka alu'ia. (Kono laughs) You, too. What? What are you laughing at? Come on. That means, "No task is too big when done together." (laughter) This is the problem with you  haoles--  no team spirit. No island spirit. Kono :  No, honestly. Come on. Be something cool like Strike Force. Chin :  Strike Force? Kono :  Yes. Strike Force. Danny :  I hate that so much. Steve :  You know, I say we keep thinking.
