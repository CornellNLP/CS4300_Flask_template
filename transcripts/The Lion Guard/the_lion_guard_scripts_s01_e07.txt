 [TITLE MUSIC PLAYING] 
 [ROARS] 
 [NARRATOR READING] 
 [KION READING] 
 Lion Guard! Ono's found dry ground. 
 We gotta round up the buffalo and guide them over there fast! 
 Nobody does fast better than me. 
 Huwesi! 
 This way, everybody! Follow me! 
 This way! That's it. 
 [GRUNTS] 
 [BELLOWS] 
 Beshte! Bunga! That last one's yours! 
 You got it, Kion! 
 [CONTINUES BELLOWING] 
 [GRUNTING] 
 Come on! Let's go, buffalo! 
 Twende Kiboko! 
 Whoa! 
 [GRUNTS] 
 [HISSING] 
 [SCREAMS] Yowch! 
 Bunga, are you okay? 
 Something bit me. And it was him. 
 We did it, Kion! The buffalo are all safe and... sound? 
 Hapana! Egyptian Cobra! 
 Whatever you do, don't let him bite you. 
 He already did. 
 [ALL GASP] 
 Oh, no! 
 Hey, Ushari? Why did you do that? 
 He landed on my head, Beshte. 
 [HISSING] He's lucky I only bit him once! 
 He's got a point. Wonder if he left a mark. 
 Bunga! Bunga! You don't understand! 
 That snake, his bite is venomous. 
 You mean it did leave a mark? 
 I mean, his bite is poison! 
 [ALL GASP] 
 Poison? That's not good. 
 That's bad. That means... That means I'm a goner! 
 [MOANING] 
 The venom's hit his system! 
 We need to suck the poison out! 
 Okay, if you think it'll help! 
 Really? 
 Ono : Maybe not. 
 I have a better idea. We'll take him to Rafiki. 
 Ono, have Timon and Pumbaa meet us at Rafiki's tree. 
 Affirmative! 
 Hang in there, Bunga. Rafiki will know what to do. 
 [BUNGA MOANING IN PAIN] 
 [PUMBAA CRYING] 
 Bunga! The bird said a snake bit ya on the bottom. 
 Oh! Say it ain't so! 
 [MOANS] It's so. 
 [BOTH GASPING AND CRYING] 
 Timon, Pumbaa, calm down. 
 I'm sure Rafiki... 
 Rafiki? What's he gonna do? 
 Who, me? 
 [LAUGHS] 
 Nothing! 
 [CHUCKLES] Thanks, Rafiki! 
 That's great. 
 Uh, nothing? 
 Rafiki, Bunga was bitten by a poisonous snake. 
 [GROANS] 
 You gotta help me. 
 I can't have much time left. 
 I think this is the end. 
 Goodbye, everyone. 
 Hello, Circle of Life. 
 Bunga! Bunga! 
 [CRYING] 
 [CRYING] 
 Eh, Bunga? Honey badgers like you, you're immune to snakebites. 
 What? "Immune"? 
 [BOTH STOP CRYING] 
 What? I thought I was a goner, but this is even worse. 
 I'm immune! 
 What's immune? 
 If you're immune to something, it can't hurt you. 
 So if I'm immune to snakebites, they can't hurt me? 
 Great! Let's go, guys! 
 Are you kidding me? 
 We were worried about you and you were faking it? 
 Uh, not exactly. I should bite you myself. 
 Easy, Fuli. 
 Bunga, we just thought you were really hurt. 
 Me, too. 
 But he's not. He's fine. 
 So let's celebrate! 
 Yeah! A feast at Hakuna Matata Falls. 
 And everyone's invited! 
 Thanks, Pumbaa. Sounds great, but I have to meet my family for dinner. 
 Me, too. 
 Uh, the flock gets jittery when I don't show up for mealtime. 
 How 'bout you, Fuli? 
 Are you meeting your cheetah family? 
 Nah. I'll just go hunt by myself. 
 By yourself? All alone? 
 That's the saddest thing I've ever heard. 
 Isn't that the saddest thing you've ever heard? 
 You're right, Pumbaa. It is! 
 Friends don't let friends eat alone. 
 It's not like that. Girl cheetahs hunt alone. 
 It's what we do. 
 Not this girl cheetah. Not today. 
 You're eating with us, and I'm not taking no for an answer. 
 But I... Ah, ah, ah. 
 Not another word. I insist. 
 After you. 
 [SIGHS] Okay. 
 Is what Timon said true? 
 Do friends not let friends eat alone? 
 If it is true, we haven't been very good friends to Fuli. 
 We need to be sure Fuli knows we're here for her. 
 How do we do that? 
 From now on, if any of us sees Fuli all alone, we'll invite her to join us in whatever we're doing. 
 Poa. Good idea, Kion. 
 Then Fuli will know we're her friends. 
 Dinner is served. 
 Oh, they're slimy, yet satisfying. 
 [MUNCHING] Ugh! 
 Mmm! The slime helps them go down smooth! 
 Uh, thanks, but I'm not really hungry. 
 Of course. How rude of me. 
 How can you dive into a meal without a little dinner conversation? [MUNCHING] 
 Mmm! 
 So, how are things on your end of the food chain? 
 Um... Good? Good, good. 
 Oh, wow. You are so soft. 
 Do you know how soft you are? 
 I, uh, don't really love having my fur touched. 
 Pumbaa. Feel this fur. 
 You could drown in fur like this. 
 Oh, oh, I wanna feel! 
 Mmm. 
 Cuddly! Oh. [MUTTERS] 
 Bunga, you try. 
 Uh, where'd he go? 
 Oh, I'm sure he's around somewhere. 
 Right here! Check it out! 
 Open wide! 
 Ah... [GRUNTS] 
 Look at me! I'm immune! Whoo! 
 Bunga! 
 What ya doing, Fuli? 
 [ANGRILY] Saving your life. 
 But you heard Rafiki. 
 I'm immune. 
 I can't be hurt. 
 I could've stayed in that croc's mouth all day. 
 [GROANS] Gah! 
 Fine. Go get eaten if you want to. 
 I'm out of here. 
 Bunga! Bubby! Want some more bugs? 
 They're delicious. 
 Are they poisonous? Of course not! 
 Where's the fun in that? 
 [SIGHS] Kids. 
 [MUNCHES] 
 Hapana! 
 Fuli's all alone. 
 Hey, Fuli! Fuli! 
 [GASPS] Ono! What's up? 
 Is there trouble? Trouble? 
 Oh. Uh, no. 
 Ono, I was hunting. 
 Hunting? That's perfect. 
 I was on my way to hunt with the other egrets. 
 You should join us. 
 Okay. Nothing like a good hunt. 
 [ELEPHANTS TRUMPETING] 
 [SCREECHING] 
 And this is nothing like a good hunt. 
 What? A good hunt? 
 Yeah, it's great. 
 Ugh, what are we doing here, Ono? 
 Do egrets eat elephants? 
 No! We eat the bugs kicked up by the elephants' feet. 
 [CHUCKLES] 
 Bugs? Again? 
 What is with everyone eating bugs? 
 [GRUNTS] 
 Ugh. 
 Ono : What's wrong, Fuli? 
 Why'd you stop? 
 Ono, I'm covered in mud! 
 [SNIFFS] 
 Oh, that's not mud. Come on! 
 [GASPS] Ugh. Gross. 
 Beshte : Fuli! Jambo! 
 [GROANS] Beshte? 
 Hey! I couldn't help but notice you're all by yourself. 
 So? 
 So, I thought you might want to join me for a swim. 
 You can meet my whole hippo pod. 
 [GROANING] 
 It's okay. I'm not a real fan of water. 
 It's not that bad once you get used to it. 
 What do you say? 
 [SIGHS] 
 Well, maybe just my paws. 
 That's the way! Yeah! 
 Whoa! [GASPS] 
 Whoops! Fuli? Fuli? 
 [COUGHING] 
 [GASPS] 
 Okay. So I'm in the water. Just like a hippo. 
 Well, uh, how do you like it? 
 It's great. 
 [CHUCKLES] Maybe we can do it again. 
 Some other time. 
 Uh, okay, Fuli. 
 [SIGHS] 
 Some other time. 
 But I gotta tell you, being immune? 
 It's un-Bunga-lievable! 
 Nothing hurts! Not even bouncing a porcupine on my head. 
 Wow. I guess you can do that with thick skin like yours. 
 Pfft! Kion! 
 Skin has nothing to do with it. 
 I'm immune! 
 98, 99... There she is! 
 Ow! 
 Ah. Sorry, guy. 
 Kion : Fuli! 
 [GROANS] 
 
 
 
 Hi, guys. 
 Hey! Sorry about the gazelle. 
 But if you're up for a hunt, you could hunt with me and my family. 
 Hunting? With the Royal Family? 
 Yeah! Thanks, Kion. Asante! 
 Hakuna Matata! You in, Bunga? Nah, I'm gonna stay here and enjoy bein' immune. Okay. See you later. Bye, Bunga. Yeah, later. Now, back to bouncing. Huh-uh! 99 bounces is enough for me. Why don't you go play in a volcano? Play in a volcano? That's a great idea! No! It's a bad idea! I was kidding! Okay Kiara, you lead the hunt. You girls ready? I'm ready if you are, Kiara. You're our leader. [GIGGLES] [SIGHS] Can we just get this over with? Come on, Zuri. Focus. Ooh, Kiara's gonna be so impressed with how I hunt those gazelles. [YAWNING] Uh-huh? Just wait till she sees what a tracky tracker and pouncy pouncer I can be. Yeah, that ought to wow her. [LAUGHING] Ooh, Queen Nala's looking. Act all excited and hunterish. [GASPS] Growl! Ugh. Do I seriously have to hunt with those two? Tiifu and Zuri? Sure. They're my sister's best friends. They're like family. Ladies, follow me. [GRUNTING] [GASPS] Zuri : Who does she think she is? Hunting right beside the future queen. [SCOFFS] Who cares? Hunting is so overrated. Let the cheetah hunt for us. Don't cheetahs like to hunt alone? Why is Fuli all like, [MIMICKING] "Look at me, I'm Kiara's new bestie." [SCOFFS] I don't even like gazelle. Hyena food. [MUNCHING] Ready? [GROWLS] Nala : And stop! [GROANS] Oof. Excellent tracking skills, Kiara! Really fantastic. Thanks, Mom. But the gazelle got away! Of course it did. We're still training for Kiara's first hunt. Come on, girls. Bye, Fuli! Fuli : Hold up. You mean I don't get to eat? What's the point of hunting if I don't get to eat? You got to hang out with us. Isn't that better than hunting alone? When I hunt alone I get to eat. Except for today, when someone in the Guard keeps stopping me! What's going on with you guys? We just thought you'd be happier with company. Do I look happier? Not really. [SIGHS] I like being alone, Kion. I enjoy it. And you know what? I've never wanted to be more alone than I do right now! Fuli! [SIGHS] Sorry. ♪ Zuka Zama, I'm immune ♪

She said she likes it. Guess we were being better friends when we just let Fuli be Fuli. Hey! Let's find Fuli and tell her from now on, we'll leave her alone! Poa! Great idea!

What's immune? I hope it's not contagious! Stuff it, fur brains! It doesn't matter. Let's just eat him! Huwezi! [GROANS] Again? You always jump in just when things are getting fun. "Fun"? Both : Whoa! Come on, boys! Follow that rock! Why do we always have to work for our food? Ain't no such thing as a free meal. I take it back. This is even more fun. Whoa! Hey, Timon was right. You really are soft. Any sign of Fuli? Not yet! Hapana! Fuli and Bunga are in trouble! We have to hurry! [SNIFFS] Do you smell something burning? [GASPS] Ow. I got it. That lava's hot. And it hurts! Calm down. It's gone now. But... But... This means I'm not immune! Whoa! A little bit further and they're ours for the eatin'. Honey badger, with a side of cheetah. Till the Pride Land's end...

But if you'd rather be alone, Fuli, that's okay too. Thanks, Kion. I do like being alone, especially when I'm hunting. But I really like hanging out with you guys, too. You do? Well, yeah. It's like you're my... my family. [SNIFFLES] That's a beautiful thing to say, Fuli. Uh, you all want a hug, don't you? [SIGHS] All right. This once. Poa! [ALL COOING] [CHUCKLES] Yeah, you too. Hmm. You were right, Little B! She is really soft. Told you.
