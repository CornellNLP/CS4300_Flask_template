 [THEME MUSIC PLAYING] 
 [ROARS] 
 [NARRATOR READING] 
 [KION READING] 
 Careful, Bunga... 
 It's a very delicate situation! 
 [GRUNTING] 
 [MUFFLED SHOUTING] 
 Sorry, Zazu. 
 Can't understand ya with your beak in that beehive. 
 [CONTINUES SHOUTING] 
 [GASPS] Thank you, Bunga! 
 That's much... [SCREAMS] 
 [BEES BUZZING] 
 Gotcha covered, Zazu! 
 [CHOMPING] 
 Gracious! 
 Maybe next time try flying under the beehive, not through it! 
 Yes. Thank you, Bunga. 
 So why were you in such a hurry? 
 I was looking for you. All of you! 
 What's the kerbubble, Zazu? 
 I've just received word. 
 The pangolins are spraying everywhere! 
 It's quite a stinky situation. 
 Odd. Pangolins only spray when they're threatened. 
 Then we better check it out. 
 My thoughts precisely! 
 Till the Pride Lands' end... 
 All : Lion Guard defend! 
 Pangolins : [YELPING] Help! Help! Sounds like we're close. Ugh. Smells like we're close. [GASPS] All : Huh? I'm sorry. Can anyone tell me what I'm looking at? No idea. [PANGOLINS WARBLING] Drop it, Majinuni! You drop it, Hafifu! This one's a real stinker! I know you are, but what is it? [FARTING] [HAFIFU LAUGHS] [SQUEAKS] [BOTH LAUGHING] Those're the biggest baboons I've ever seen! I don't think they're baboons. Ugh. They sure act like baboons. I've never seen anyone like them. And I know every animal in the Pride Lands. Well, whatever they are, they need to leave those pangolins alone! Kion : Hey! You two! Put down the pangolins! Put them down? But they're so much fun to squeeze! They are! [IN SING-SONG] Squeezy! Squeezy! Squeezy! Kion : No! Oh, hello! Have we met? Would you mind not standing on us? Sure. If you promise to stop messing with the pangolins. Deal! Deal! [BOTH LAUGHING] Oh look! You've brought some friends! What fun! So, who are you? And what are you doing in the Pride Lands? [BOTH LAUGHING] Ah, well, that's easy. I'm Majinuni, and this is my brother Hafifu. We're looking for someone called King Zimba. He's a "lion"? I think they mean Simba. Yes! That's right! Do you know him? Yeah, you could say that. Kion here just happens to be his son. You're a lion? You're a prince? Both : So are we! [LAUGHING] Wait. You guys are lions? No, they're princes! Seriously? No wonder we've got so much in common! We do? Our poppa sent us here with a message for your poppa! A really important message! [BOTH LAUGHING] Kion, there is no way anyone sent these two with a message for the king. Look at 'em! [VOCALIZING] [GASPS] Majinuni, look! A stick! Excuse me? A what? Bet you can't hit that baobab fruit. Bet you I can! No, wait! Stop. Stop! I am not a stick! I am a snake! [GASPS] [SPITS] [GROANS] Every time I get near the Lion Guard... Hafifu! Why'd you do that? Uh, 'cause I wanted to throw the stick. Ushari's not a stick! You just heard him say so! Uh, he's got a point. As a rule, sticks don't talk. Ah. Oh, well.  Kuishi ni kucheka! What does that mean? It's our motto! It means, "To live is to laugh!" You know...  ♪ Kuishi ni kucheka! ♪ 
♪ Live with a laugh and a smile! ♪ 
♪ Kuishi ni kucheka! ♪ 
♪ Stays with you all the while ♪ [BOTH LAUGHING] Right? Uh, nope. Don't know that one. They've never heard of it. How could they never have heard of it? Maybe we should sing it in a different key...  ♪ Kuishi ni kucheka... ♪ That won't be necessary. Look. I'll take you to my dad so you can give him your message. Now come on. Walk this way. [BOTH LAUGHING] [LAUGHS] [FARTS] [ALL LAUGHING] These gorilla-dillas are my kinda guys! [SIGHS] Kion : Uh, Dad... This is probably going to sound weird... What is it, son? Well, we've found these gorilla brothers who say they... Have a message for me? Yes. You know them? Their father is King Sokwe of the Mountain Gorillas. A long time ago, he and I made a peace treaty. Now, every wet season, he sends a message to let me know if he still agrees to the peace. Or not. So... Majinuni and Hafifu really do have an important message for you? Very important. Where are they? [SIGHS] They're coming. Ooh! Yeah! [LAUGHS] Kuishi! All : Ni kucheka! [SIMBA CLEARS THROAT] Aw, hey, Your Highness! Lemme introduce these guys... Majinuni. Hafifu. You have a message for me? Yes, um, about that... We do have a message... Er, we did, but... Boys? Both : He forgot it! Why am I not surprised? I see. This is not good. I need you and the Lion Guard to take the boys back home and find out what King Sokwe's message is. Can't you just send them back and get the message again? And let peace with the gorillas depend on them? I bet I can stand on one foot longer than you. So? Bet you can't hop on one foot while patting your nose and rubbing your belly. [BOTH VOCALIZING] Got it. Where's their home? Simba : The Theluji Mountains. Wow! That's a long way off. Yes, but King Sokwe's sons should know the way. Okay, now let's see who can balance longer on no legs! [BOTH GRUNT] [BOTH LAUGH] I hope. Fuli : Please tell me we're almost there. We are! We just have to go up the mountain and find King Sokwe. Majinuni, Hafifu. Can you tell us where your dad is? Oh, you know... Up there somewhere. You guys really don't know how to get home from here? Sorry. We've never gone up the mountain before. To tell the truth, we've only gone down the mountain once. Yeah, and we rolled most of the way at that! [BOTH LAUGHING] Ono? Where to next? I see a path through the trees! Great. Then we'll go that way. Thanks for the help. [CHUCKLES] Well, she certainly is polite. I know, right? I didn't think we were helpful at all. [BOTH LAUGHING] Guys? Any of this look familiar? Not to me. I think he was talking to the gorillas. Did you say gorillas? Are there gorillas here somewhere? Is Poppa here? [GULPS] Uh, Poppa? [SIGHS EXASPERATEDLY] I was talking to you! You're the gorillas! Oh! Pfft! We are the gorillas. We're the gorillas! We're the gorillas! [BOTH EXCLAIM] [LAUGHING] And until we get them home, they're our gorillas. [SIGHS] Yeah... So which way do we go from here? That way! That way! No, no! That way! No, no! That way! Maybe we can ask this little green guy. What little green guy?  Poa! He was green a second ago! He must be a chameleon! A ka-what-eon? A chameleon! A lizard that can change his colors! Did you hear that, brother? I heard that, brother! Both : Chameleon hide and seek! [BOTH EXCLAIMING] No, wait! Come back! Majinuni : [SING-SONG] I'm gonna find it. Hafifu : [LAUGHS] No, I'm gonna find it! Ono? Please follow them. On it! Hafifu! Majinuni! Hafifu : Hello! Where are you? Hafifu : Excellent question! Wish we could say! Majinuni : It is a bit of a puzzler! We can hear you, but we can't see you! Ono? Sorry, Kion... The plants are too thick. I can't even see the ground! You smell 'em? [SNIFFING] Too many weird plants in bloom. I don't think I could even track Bunga's scent here. [SNIFFS] Yeah, me neither. Hmm... Hafifu! Majinuni! Stay still! When I call your names, shout back. We'll follow your voices and find you! Hafifu : Ooh, yes! But let's make it a game! You shout kuishi, then we shout ni kucheka! Fine. Kuishi! Kuishi! Majinuni : Oh, it's our turn. Ni kucheka! Sounds like they're this way. Right. Let's go! Kion : Kuishi! Ni kucheka! Kuishi? Majinuni : Ni kucheka! Now it sounds like they're back there. [SIGHS] Hafifu! Majinuni! This game isn't working! Then let's change the game! Both : Forest hog chase! Brilliant! Lion Guard! We shall now snort like forest hogs while you chase us! [BOTH LAUGHING] Chase them? Seriously? I don't even know what forest hogs sound like. [HAFIFU AND MAJINUNI SNORTING] Now you do! 
 
 I see trees moving! I think they're heading uphill... Right into the fog! Okay. Thanks, Ono! Kion : Let's go! Majinuni! Hafifu! [LOUD SNORTING] That snort came from behind us. You think the gorillas split up? Ono : Or it might possibly be a...  [SNORTING] ...real forest hog! Hapana! Hey, listen! They're doing hog snorts, too! I'm glad they're getting into the spirit of the... [SNORTING] ...forest hog! Did you say the spirit of the forest hog? Ah! Forest hog! [FOREST HOG SNORTING] The forest hog! It's after them! Fuli : Wait for us! Why's the hog acting so mad? He must think the gorillas are other forest hogs! Hogging in on his territory! [LAUGHS] Get it? Forest hog... Hogging? Ah? Bunga! [SNORTS] [BOTH EXCLAIMING] [BOTH GRUNTING] [SNORTS] [BOTH EXCLAIMING] [KION GRUNTS] [SNORTS] [GROWLS] Back off of the gorillas! [SNORTS] [HUFFS] [GRUNTS] [SQUEALS] You can't get to them without going through me. And you're not getting through me. Fuli : Or us! [SNORTS] Okay, then. [SQUEALING] Hafifu? Majinuni? You okay? Uh, surprisingly enough, we are. Totally unpoked by sharp hoggy tusks! You saved us! Well, sure. That's what we do. Now let's get you home. I've got a better idea. Let's get chased by the forest hog again! What? Seriously? [BOTH LAUGHING] Guys? Is something else going on? Well, we haven't been very helpful getting you to our poppa... Because we don't really want to see him. I knew something was going on! You couldn't be that silly. Oh, no. We are. Totally silly! Dozy! Dopey! Wacky! Immature and frivolous. That's a lot of words for silly. Okay. So tell me. Why don't you want to see your dad? For some reason he's never thought we're prince material. So we decided to show him he's wrong. We volunteered to deliver his really important message. And then we failed miserably. Now we have to go home and tell him. He's going to put on his... Both : Disappointed face. I get it. Both : You do? I never want to let down my dad either. It's the whole reason I'm here. I'm really sorry. I wish I could do something to make it easier. Well, you did face down a ferocious forest hog. That's almost as hard as facing our dad. And it seemed like the sort of thing a prince would do. We don't exactly feel like princes yet... Trust me. If you act like a prince, sooner or later, you'll start to feel like a prince. [SIGHS] Okay, then. We'll take you to our home. Great! Possibly one last little game? Lion guard : No! [SIGHS] All right. This way. Not much farther... Both : Whee! Heyvi kabisa. Fuli : What is this? Ono : I... I don't know. Me neither. [LAUGHS] But I like it.  Poa. Betcha never seen snow before! Snow? Huh. What do you do with it? Do? You have fun! [ALL EXCLAIM] Hey! Whoo! [LAUGHS] Come on! You just going to stand there, or are you going to play? Kion? Well... I guess a little fun couldn't hurt. All right!  Zuka Zama! It's cold. And slippery! [GRUNTS] [LAUGHS] But it's kinda fun! I want to try.  Twende Kiboko! [LAUGHING] It's melting on my beak! Kion, you've got to try this! It's un-Bunga-lievable! I don't know, guys. We should be careful with this stuff. We don't know enough about it. You know it can do this! [BOTH LAUGHING] Oh, it's on.

♪ Zuka Zama... ♪ That's not to throw at me, is it? Nah! It's a souvenir for Uncle Timon. [LAUGHTER] I could do this all day. [SIGHS] Us too! But we promised we'd get you to our dad. Yeah. I just want to take one more look, so I'll never forget it. Whoa! Guys? Guys! All : Kion! Whoa! I'm coming, Kion!  Zuka... [GRUNTS] Sorry for the quick-stop, Bunga. But Kion needs someone who knows the mountain. Two someones! Both : Kuishi ni kucheka! Ono! Follow Kion! On it! Whoo-hoo! Whoo! See you at the bottom, brother! [SCOFFS] You'll see my bottom, brother! 'Cause I'll get to Kion first! Whoa! [EXCLAIMS] Argh! [LAUGHS] Look at me! I'm flying! [VOCALIZING] Ooh! Chilly! [EXCLAIMS] [GASPS] [GRUNTS] Kion? Are you okay? So far! But I can't hang on long! [BOTH GRUNTING] Not helping, Ono! [GASPS] Sorry! Whoo-hoo! Hang on, Kion! Good advice, brother! [BOTH GRUNT] [SCREAMS] I can't look! [GRUNTS] [PANTS] You saved me. Thanks. Pfft! No thanks needed. It was fun! Oh no! It was more than that. It was brave. Doing something like that is what you makes you prince material. You really think we have that in us? The prince thing? Totally. Sokwe : So... you forgot my message to King Simba! Both : Yes, Poppa. And you got lost coming home from the Pride Lands! Both : Yes, Poppa. And you needed the Lion Guard to help you get back home? Both : Yes, Poppa. You know what this means. Both : Yes, Poppa. [SOFTLY] What do you think it means? Nothing too bad, I hope. Kuishi ni kucheka! [LAUGHING] [BOTH LAUGHING] Sokwe : Kion told me how you saved him. I'm proud of you both. You are true gorilla princes. Both : Thank you, Poppa. Um, speaking of your message for my dad? We do need to give it to him. Of course you do. [LAUGHS] I see your friend has a souvenir from our home. Sure do! Uh... Your Gorilla-ness! Is that's a problem? No, no. Not at all. In fact, it's perfect. Kion : And, so... here we are. And did you bring back King Sokwe's message? Uh, yeah... Well, then? It's just... Kion? I need the message. Are you sure? Yes! You have to give it to me! Okay...  Kuishi ni kucheka! [GRUNTS] Sorry, Your Majesty. It really wasn't my idea. [SING-SONG VOICE] This might have been a mistake. [CHUCKLES] Oh, King Sokwe. No one delivers a peace message like him. [ALL LAUGHING]
