 If you're saying that, you're a man. 
 You're a backwards-thinking, backwards-cap-wearing, male-pattern-baldness-hiding man. 
 So, bitch and moan all you want, gentlemen, but tonight, a girl's gonna be the lead sports story in the world. 
 And if that upsets you, well, maybe you're just getting your period.

 Matt Vasgersian (on TV) : Well, unless you've been under a rock for the past 48 hours, you know that the San Diego Padres have called up Ginny Baker to start today against the Los Angeles Dodgers. 
 Baker becomes the first female athlete to compete in any of the four major North American professional sports leagues. 
 This after a five-year journey through the Padres system, and it marks a day that many, quite frankly, doubted would ever come. 
 This is clearly a momentous occasion in the history of the sport. 
 For those of you that may have been alive when Jackie Robinson made his debut, this may take you back to that. 
 But for the rest of us, it really illustrates... 
 You're like Elvis. 
 You're like Elvis. 
 I'm El... uh, I'm Eliot. 
 I work with Amelia. She thought I could help manage your social media accounts, maybe get you set up on Insta... 
 This is a story that should inspire both... 
 Game day. Don't take it personal. 
 Hey, Joe? It's Joe, right? 
 Yes, ma'am. 
 Who's the most important person you've ever driven? 
 Well, back in the early '90s, I once drove... 
 Wrong answer, Joe. 
 The most important person you've ever driven is the 23-year-old sitting right next to me. 
 It's just a two-minute drive to the stadium. Please stop at stop signs and watch your blind spots. 
 We screw up nothing today. 
 Copy that. 
 Who'd you drive, early '90s? 
 Michael Jackson. 
 Very cool. 
 He even said he liked my tie. Well, actually, he... 
 Okay, Joe, that's enough. 
 But what do we know about Ginny Baker as an actual, you know, Major League pitcher? 
 Ken Rosenthal : Well, she's no power arm, Matt. 
 She tops out in the high 80s, which has gotten a lot of attention, but it's still low by Major League standards. 
 She does have an arsenal of pitches, though, including that nasty screwball. 
 (turns TV off) 
 Hey. 
 You know the drill, G. 
 Nothing you haven't seen before. Maybe just on a slightly bigger scale.

 Here we go. 
 What...? What you doing, boy? 
 For God's sake, get back in there. 
 No way.

 Bill, he doesn't want to play.

 I'll be damned. 
 (crowd cheering) 
 Man : There she is! 
 Ginny! 
 (cheering grows louder) 
 Ginny, hi. 
 Hi. 
 Oscar Arguella, Padres GM. 
 Stay with me. 
 Fans started lining up the moment the call-up was announced. 
 Web site crashed within minutes. 
 Our nerds had no idea what hit them. 
 Hell of a thing you're doing, young lady. 
 You nervous? 
 No, not really. Makes one of us. 
 Come on, boss is waiting for you. 
 Ginny, welcome. 
 Hope the trip in was okay. 
 I was going to send my plane, but Oscar tells me that you like to be treated regularly, and while my plane is most certainly cool as hell, regular it is not. 
 Walk with me. 
 Your teammates are excited to meet you. 
 No, they're not. 
 Ticketing and sales people, they're excited to meet me. 
 My teammates, 75% think I'm the next San Diego Chicken. 
 The other 25% just want to see me shower. 
 And I bet your manager thinks you should've called up Walker instead of me. 
 I'm just here because of all that. 
 But none of that matters, you know why? 
 No, but color me intrigued. 
 Because today, I'm the starting pitcher for the San Diego Padres. 
 Well, damn it, Oscar, you see that? 
 You should've let me send her the plane. 
 Al : She's on her way down. 
 Look, we can lie to the reporters all we want, but obviously this is a distraction. 
 There's no way around it. 
 I had to buy tickets for my freakin' mother-in-law today. 
 (laughter) 
 Oh, that reminds me, if you see her in the stands, please say hi. 
 She's the one with the face that looks like Shrek. 
 No offense, Shrek. 
 It's 2016, gentlemen. 
 So let's be gentlemen. 
 Let's be professional. Remember, this is a spot starter called up from Triple A to start a game for us. 
 We're gonna treat her like any other player. 
 No special treatment. 
 Knock, knock. 
 Oh, crap. 
 Ginny Baker. 
 Get your big old bubble butt over here and give me a hug! 
 (chuckles) Blip! 
 (Ginny giggles) 
 Blip : I came up through the system with this girl. 
 We did almost a full season together in San Antonio. 
 What was that, like, three years back now? 
 Yeah, that's right. 
 Until you got promoted, became an All-Star, and permanently abandoned my ass. 
 You know, as much as I loved living off of ramen noodles, the wife had other plans. 
 I bet she did. 
 She spends everything, Ginny. 
 (laughs) 
 So where they setting you up? 
 Al : This is the clubhouse attendance room, but at least it has a door. 
 This is not gonna be permanent, I'm telling you that right now. 
 Sorry, who is this complete stranger in my clubhouse pretending to be my boss? 
 Amelia : We still haven't met, probably because I don't represent lifetime 500 managers with man boobs. 
 Oscar? 
 Amelia. 
 Al. 
 Everyone. 
 (clears throat) 
 This is fine, Skip. 
 I didn't see Mike Lawson back in there. 
 He likes to make a grand entrance. 
 Total diva. 
 I'd kill him, but he has this annoying habit of driving in 130 runs a year.

 Reporter : Ginny, Ginny. 
 How does this differ from Triple A? 
 One or two more of you, maybe. 
 This was supposed to be a photo op, not a presser. 
 She'll be fine. 
 I know she'll be fine, Oscar. 
 I've been watching her navigate this crap for a year. 
 Reporter 2 : Frank, you must be pleased that Ginny's start is sold out tonight. 
 I'm ending this. 
 Amelia, relax. 
 She's not Nolan Ryan, she's a number five starter (scoffs) being called up for a spot start. 
 She's the number five starter that's been offered the cover of Time, Sports Illustrated, and Maxim in the same week. 
 I mean, you do realize what you have, Oscar, don't you? 
 Because I do. I put my entire client list on hold to represent a pitcher and I'd never even been to a baseball game. 
 I'm gonna lose Clooney and I don't care. 
 He invites me to Lake Como. 
 And I'm giving that up instantly and without hesitation. 
 Because this girl is Hillary Clinton with s*x appeal. 
 She is a Kardashian with a skill set. 
 She's the most important woman on the planet right now, Oscar, and from here on out, everything goes through me. 
 Am I being clear? 
 (whispering): What's Clooney's place in Como like? 
 It's exactly like San Diego, but a million times better. 
 (sighs) 
 From here on out. 
 You'll be in the loop. 
 Thank you. 
 Dinner? 
 Never. I'm pulling her. 
 You have no chance. 
 I've seen her make movie stars cry, won't say who. 
 Gerard Butler. 
 Amelia : Last question. 
 (reporters clamoring) 
 (players laughing and talking indistinctly) 
 Look what we got here. 
 Ginny Baker in the flesh. 
 I've been answering questions about you forever, and that is not easy for me, you know, talking about other people. 
 They tell me I'm a narcissist. 
 I should tell you, I have your rookie card. 
 You've been my favorite player since I was... - Yeah, don't. 
 Makes you look stupid, makes me feel old. 
 Would it be inappropriate to say that you might be the second prettiest teammate I've ever had? 
 It would. 
 What? Second prettiest? 
 Yeah, I was in this charity softball game with DiCaprio. 
 Beautiful eyes. 
 Anyway, glad you're here. We could use you. 
 Mind if we go over the hitters in the trainers' room? 
 Fine by me. 
 (distant): Oh! 
 (laughter) 
 Hey. 
 Think that's funny? 
 Think you're the first teammate to slap my ass to get a laugh from his friends? 
 No. 
 I played two years Winterball, five years in the minors. 
 I've done stints in hellholes you haven't seen in a decade, superstar. 
 Want to put on a show for your friends? 
 Find another scene partner, I'm here to pitch. 
 Any questions? 
 Hey. Hey! 
 I slap asses. It's my thing. 
 I slap Zimmerman's pimply ass, I slap Roger's hairy ass, and as long as you're on this team, I will be slapping your perfect, pear-shaped ass. 
 I am an ass-slapper, rookie. 
 I'm also the captain of this team. 
 So from here on out, every time I slap your ass, you just say, "Thank you, sir. 
 May I have another?" and take the mound. 
 Do you have any questions? 
 Young DiCaprio or old DiCaprio? 
 I'm sorry? 
 The charity game. 
 Young Leo, fine. He's probably prettier than me. 
 But old Leo looks like a fish. 
 Well, that was... it was a while ago. He was young. 
 Then I think we're on the same page, Captain.

Now, the key is, when you throw it, you don't exert any pressure from these two fingers, okay? I don't want to see any dents in the nectarine from these fingers. When you can throw 100 proper, then we'll try it with a real ball. (crowd cheering and applauding) (sighs) Joe Buck :  And there you have it.

And that may be all for Ginny Baker, with the lefty Morris coming up. Six and a third, eight hits, three runs, five strikeouts. You know, if the bullpen holds this lead, she'll get the win. What a gutty performance. Smoltz :  And off her last start, it might as well have been a no-hitter, Joe. I can get out of it. She's done. I said I can go another. And I decided otherwise. And I'm still the skipper here, am I not, Baker? Yes, sir. Because there's been some confusion about that lately. And as long as you're gonna be sticking around, I'd like some order restored in my damn clubhouse. Good job, rook. We'll take it from here. Go take your bow. She doesn't like the ass-slapping. Good to know. (crowd cheers loudly) Joe Buck : [/i]Just listen to this crowd. Welcome to the big leagues, Ginny. We've been waiting for you.[/i] ♪ ♪ Whatever. Nice win, Pitch. Thanks, Tommy. Enjoy your moment in the sun. 'Cause there's 29 pro teams as we speak figuring out that little trick pitch of yours, and when they do, I'll get my job back and you'll become the answer to a trivia question. Okay. (scoffs) Bitch. Hey, Tommy, who's the bitch, huh? Why don't you say it to my face? Hey, walk away. Stay out of this, Sanders. Walk away. Why do I get the feeling you've tapped that ass? (players clamoring) Cut it out! Come on, Tommy! (sighs) Okay, yeah. No, I'm on top of it, thank you. (door opens) So there I am, pouring myself a glass of an absurdly expensive Scotch, celebrating one of the biggest nights of my life, when I get a call from a reporter asking for a comment on the post-game brawl. I was just about to call you... We got something here, Oscar. We have ourselves a moment. Yes, we do. Now, I know you love Al. Yes, I do. He's a good manager, but the world changed tonight, Oscar, and I'm not convinced that he's the man to take us into the new one. He's lost control of the team. Well, what are you gonna do? What am I gonna do? I'm going to return to my office and drink my absurdly expensive Scotch. But you, my friend, you are going to get me... a short list.
