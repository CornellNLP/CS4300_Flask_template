 Hey, it's him. 
 Who, Mommy? Who? 
 Mommy, who is it? 
 Why, that's Batman, honey. 
 Maybe it's not him. 
 What's his story? 
 Let's ask. 
 They stopped it. 
 You okay? 
 Great. Never been better. 
 Right. Now, there's a window a few feet from here, and if you just follow me... 
 Window? I'm not going in. This is gonna be the best night of my life. 
 It could also be the last. 
 Oh, come on. 
 There's nothing to be afraid of. Fear's a prison, you see... and I've just broken out. 
 Tag! 
 That's awesome. 
 Come on. 
 And after that, Batman handed him over to the cops. 
 Wasn't anything we could do. 
 What's the use of providing me with test patients... if you're going to lose them? 
 You should have monitored him more carefully. 
 We tried, but we had no idea your treatment would be that effective. 
 All the more reason to keep the subjects under close scrutiny. 
 We don't want to give ourselves away just yet. Do we? 
 How was the inspection, Mr. Wayne? 
 Fine, Sara. Did I miss anything? 
 Just Seymour Grey. He's been calling all morning. 
 Who? 
 One of the clerks downstairs. 
 He's sort of a quiet guy, usually. 
 Oh, there's one more thing. 
 Let me guess. 
 Playing hooky? 
 It's summer vacation. 
 How do you forget that? 
 Never mind. I forgot who I was talking to. 
 What have you heard about our Tarzan guy? 
 Still unconscious. 
 But the police found out something interesting about him. 
 He had acrophobia. 
 It means fear of heights. 
 No joke? Then why...? 
 You can't put me off any longer, Wayne! I've got ideas! 
 Ideas that are going to revolutionize cost accounting. 
 Mr. Grey, I presume. 
 Yeah, that's me, mousy Seymour Grey. 
 Been sitting at the same desk 18 years, afraid to say anything. 
 Afraid of losing my job. 
 Mr. Wayne, I'm so sorry. I've called security. 
 It's all right, Sara. Mr. Grey, now's not really the time. 
 Oh, gonna try to intimidate me, huh? 
 Well, if you think I'm just gonna crawl back to my desk, you're wrong. 
 Because I quit! 
 And one more thing. 
 Mr. Grey! 
 I'm in the phone book, baby. 
 It paralyzes us, keeps us from getting what we want. 
 Keeps us from experiencing life to the fullest. 
 That's what fear does. Now, how many of you... want to banish it from your lives? Abandon it? 
 Root it out of your psyches? 
 Well, folks, I can help you forget about your fear... and find the happiness you deserve. 
 Terrifying, aren't they? 
 What's going on? 
 That's what I'd like to know. 
 Who are you? Why were you snooping around? 
 Easy, easy. I was just looking for some loose cash. 
 I wasn't trying to move in on your operation. 
 Whatever it is. 
 A thief. 
 I thought as much. 
 Hey, be cool. 
 Scared you, didn't I? 
 They don't seem so frightening now, do they? 
 That's it, tough guy. Come and get me. 
 Welcome to the food chain. 
 
 
 
 What's taking him? 
 Could be any number of things. 
 Investigations require time. 
 Suit up and get in the plane. 
 You gonna tell me what's going on? 
 It's The Scarecrow. 
 He's developed a gas that takes away people's fear. 
 No more fear? Cool. 
 The man on the ledge last night. The one at my office. 
 Imagine a whole city like that. 
 I see your point. 
 Hey! 
 This gas that takes away your fear, by any chance, did you breathe it? 
 Yes, but I can handle it. 
 Oh, yeah? 
 The gas canisters are in here. 
 Here today, gone tonight. 
 Lf I were you, I wouldn't move. 
 You're not me. 
 Batman. 
 Shoot him. 
 Get the gun. 
 Hey, come back. 
 Where's the gas? 
 Go ahead. Throw me in jail. 
 It won't do you any good. 
 Who said anything about jail? 
 Batman! 
 Quiet. 
 Help! 
 You didn't answer my question. 
 I can't. He'll kill me. 
 Death is death. Does it matter who administers it? 
 You're not really gonna? 
 No. No! No! 
 My question, remember? 
 He took the gas down to the 72nd Street subway station. 
 Why? 
 He's gonna fill the tunnels with it. 
 Just in time for rush hour. 
 Help me. Please! 
 This isn't the time for games. Now, untie me. 
 It's no game. You're out of control. 
 You don't know what you're talking about. 
 That gas has affected you more than you think. 
 I told you, I can handle it. 
 You can't. You're not even afraid to kill. 
 I'll be back for you as soon as I can. 
 Robin, it's hard for me to say this, but you did the right thing. 
 I was out of control, and you've made me see that. 
 I did what I had to. 
 What now? 
 I've got to stop The Scarecrow. 
 I can help you. I know him. 
 But... 
 Don't worry, you'll be the boss on this one. 
 You almost fooled me. 
 Untie me, you little... Untie me! 
 Hurry up with that stuff. 
 We're coming. 
 This message is for the mayor. 
 You'll soon see what Gotham City will be like without fear. 
 And it won't be pretty. 
 Fear is the glue that holds society together. 
 It's what makes people suppress their worst impulses. 
 Fear is power. 
 And today it will also be quite expensive... if you want the antidote. 
 You're not getting anything from anyone, except this. 
 Get him off me. 
 What do we do now? 
 Leave, before his partner shows up. 
 Better odds, yeah? 
 Don't do it. 
 Fool. You'll get us killed. 
 You're not trying to scare me, are you? 
 You can't. 
 Watch me. 
 I can't stop it. You're gonna have to jump. 
 What about Scarecrow? 
 I'll take care of him. 
 I'll get him off the train. 
 Last night when I tied you up, I didn't mean... 
 Don't apologize. You were right. 
 Yeah, but it was kind of scary. 
 A little fear's a good thing.
