 Okay, so I've seen the old junk. Now can I go play some videos? 
 The point of bringing you here... was to keep you away from those games for one night. 
 Well, at least I'm not the only prisoner here. 
 So they got you too, huh? 
 I beg your pardon. 
 You know, did your parents force you into this? 
 I'm here by myself. 
 Well, at least you've got kitty to keep you company. 
 Ladies and gentlemen, tonight we offer a number of fascinating artifacts... 
 ...from the so-called Dark Ages. First on the block is this. 
 It is rumored to have been the personal branding iron... of the Arthurian-era witch Morgan le Fay. 
 Legend has it this piece has some sort of magical power. 
 Gotham Auctioneers, Limited, makes no such guarantee. 
 The suggested opening bid is 10,000. 
 One hundred thousand. 
 I said, 100,000. 
 Master Klarion. 
 Good to see you again. One hundred thousand is the bid. 
 That kid has a 100 grand? You've gotta raise my allowance. 
 The bid is 100,000. Do I hear...? 
 One hundred ten. 
 One hundred and ten is the bid from Mister Blood, is it? 
 One-twenty. 
 One-thirty. 
 One-forty. 
 One-fifty. 
 Two-fifty. 
 Going once, going twice... 
 One million. 
 A million? 
 This is absurd. 
 The bid is 1,000,000. 
 Going once, going twice. Sold. 
 There goes my raise. 
 So, what now? Gonna buy a herd of cattle to use it on? 
 No. This was to help a friend. 
 That's some kind of friend. 
 You don't know the half of it. 
 Exquisite craftsmanship, isn't it, Mr. Wayne? 
 Enjoy it while you can. 
 Who are...? 
 Klarion. 
 Why am I not surprised to see you here? 
 We do have a way of bumping into each other, Uncle Jason. 
 Next time, it'll be on purpose. 
 Jason. 
 Bruce. Thanks for stepping in. 
 It was nothing. But tell me, how'd you ever get a brat like that for a nephew? 
 We're not related. For some reason, it amuses him to call me "Uncle." 
 But don't underestimate him. He'll do anything to get what he wants. 
 Surely his parents... 
 Don't expect any help from them. 
 The witch-boy turned them into mice. 
 You're not serious. 
 I'll repay you for this, Bruce. I promise. It may be a while. 
 Let's just call it a professional courtesy. 
 Who's this? Sure is ugly. 
 It's Merlin's demon, Etrigan. 
 Merlin? The knights-in-armor magician guy? 
 He had his own demon? 
 He summoned it to defend the realm of Camelot, Merlin's home. 
 When Camelot fell, Merlin decided to keep the demon in service of humanity... and merged it with one of King Arthur's noblemen. 
 Look, there's something on the back of it. 
 It looks like you. 
 You think? 
 But that'd be impossible. You'd have to be over 1500 years old. 
 Gone, gone, the form of man Rise the demon, Etrigan 
 The demon. It's real. 
 There'll be a reckoning. 
 Who...? How...? 
 Get the fire extinguisher. Now! 
 
 
 
 She's gone. 
 As is the brand. 
 Ah, Teekl. You've done well for me. 
 Ancient Morgan, I beseech you From what is one do now make two Ancient Morgan, I beseech you 
 Come on, I've had sunburns worse than this. 
 This won't hurt a bit. 
 So all this is what I think it is, right? Magic? Sorcery? 
 There are more things in heaven and earth, Horatio... than are dreamt of in your philosophy. 
 What's that supposed to mean? 
 It means get up. We've got a branding iron to find. 
 Jason? 
 Jason? Etrigan? What's happening? 
 Etrigan, wait. Something's wrong. 
 Nothing is wrong. My new master awaits. 
 You hate me, don't you? 
 Speak up, I order you. 
 Yes, I hate you. 
 But there's nothing you can do about it. Not while I have this. 
 You can't do anything unless I tell you to. 
 And you have to do everything I say. Understand? 
 Good. Now, let's go have some fun. 
 It was the demon's presence in my body... all those centuries that kept me from aging. 
 But now, I'll be showing every day of my age, until... 
 That's not going to happen, Jason. Not if I can help it. 
 Me too. 
 You're staying here, Tim. 
 Jason might need you. 
 Bruce, you're trying to find a kid. 
 Who's better than another kid to help? 
 I have a feeling Klarion won't be hard to find. 
 I hate sequels. Do it. 
 Ice cream. 
 Well? What are you waiting for? 
 No strawberry, master. 
 There's nothing as good as strawberry. 
 Nothing. Except maybe cake. 
 Delicious! Delicious! 
 Noisy! 
 And now those ugly old buildings. 
 You've done enough damage for one night, young man. 
 You think you're going to stop me? 
 Yes. 
 No one's talked to me like that in so long. 
 Get used to it. 
 I'd rather not. 
 That's why no one talks to me that way. 
 He's killing him. 
 Relax. 
 Would now be a good time to conjure up a flock of woodpeckers? 
 Oh, I see. You're having some help from Uncle Jason, aren't you? 
 Etrigan, no more games. Kill him. 
 Yes, master. 
 You better think of something, and fast. 
 It's another of Uncle Jason's tricks. Get them all. 
 That's the real one. Get him. 
 Etrigan's coming for him. Do something. 
 I'm running out of strength. 
 How could you have lost him? 
 Don't you growl at me. You have to do everything I say, remember? 
 What I want you to do now is go to the source and kill Uncle Jason. 
 It doesn't sound so good for us. 
 Get me that blue powder on the shelf over there. 
 Now, spread it around us in a circle. 
 What good will that do? 
 Do what I say. 
 Okay, it's done. 
 This is the only place where you'll be safe from him. 
 Don't give up, Etrigan. 
 Think I could have some of this powder for my utility belt? 
 Looks like it's time for another spell, Mr. Blood. Mr. Blood? 
 Yes! Quiet, Teekl. I want to savor this. 
 I said quiet! 
 That's mine! 
 The witch's evil now undo Make the one from what is two 
 Etrigan? Mr. Blood? 
 You've been through a lot tonight, both of you, but we've still got a problem. 
 Look, Teekl. Dinner. 
 Sit! 
 So you picked up a few tricks. It won't save you. 
 What now? 
 Mother's grief, father's shame Soon he goes to whence he came What's that mean? I'm sending him to his room. About tonight... Don't ask. Just don't ask.
