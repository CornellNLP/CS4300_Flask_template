 Okay, Jack, we're going live in three, two, one. 
 After 30 years of painstaking research and excavation... Dr. Margaret Madsen has brought the Ultrasaurus back to life... so to speak, here in Gotham City. 
 I'd say the work has paid off very well for you, Dr. Madsen. 
 Quite frankly, Mr. Ryder, I never considered it work. 
 Hey, you can't come in here. 
 Okay, everybody... 
 Freeze. 
 Hey, I wanted to say it. Show's over, handsome. What's going on here? What do you want? It's beautiful. So sad you have to lose it. There isn't an archaeological institution in the world that would buy a stolen fossil. This wouldn't be worth anything to you. To me, no. But it's worth everything to you, isn't it? I did not come here to steal bones, Dr. Madsen. I came to steal hope. No! Why? Why? Why not? Bone-chilling, isn't it? And there it was, right on my TV. Mr. Freeze and that lizard. Dinosaur. Whatever. Doesn't make any sense. What does Victor Fries gain by destroying a bunch of bones? That's the question, all right. Wish I had the answer. Ladies and gentlemen. Today marks the beginning of Gotham City's tricentennial celebration. Excuse me. In honor of the event, the Gotham City Council has commissioned this work of art. Alfred, I'll need to change. Very good, sir. It's now my great pleasure to present to you... Guiseppe Bianci's "Twilight in Gotham." Thank you. Thank you. I feel like my life is just beginning. You have made the struggle worthwhile. And I shall make it worth nothing. What's going on here? Nobody move! What are they doing? I don't understand any of this. Technique is extraordinary. How long did it take you to develop it? Five years? Ten? A lifetime? No. No, please. I'm too old. I can't paint another. Yes, it's a pity. Search your hearts for the thing you value most... then despair, for I have come to take it from you. No! Get him! What are you waiting for? Not this time, not this way. Come. Wait, what about me? I got a crisis here. My dear, you don't know the meaning of the word. So Freeze just let you go? Doesn't make sense. Nothing about Freeze's behavior makes sense anymore. Before, he did everything to keep his wife alive. But after she was revived, he never came to see her. Why not? Nobody knows. She finally gave up waiting, married her doctor and left Gotham for good. And after the last few days, who can blame her? Brain wave activity is completely normal. Thank you, doctor. But normal is hardly a word I would use to describe myself. Victor, we did the best we could, considering. We were able to stabilize your condition. It's time for you to let us out of here. Past time. Your departure will be at my discretion, no sooner. So who's next, Freeze? Someone important. Someone who feels safe, secure, untouchable. As my father once told me: "Those who have the most, must give the most. " Those who have the most also have the most to lose, Mr. Wayne. 
 
 Hey, best score yet. Not bad, for a corpse. But I lasted longer this time. Dead is dead. I say we call it a night. Good idea... for me. You need more practice. Hey! Alfred tells me you failed a civics test. Like I really care what a district attorney does. You don't know the first thing about the American justice system, do you? I know it's bogus. And how did you come to that... well-thought-out conclusion? Watching you. No need to announce us, Jeeves. You don't exactly follow the rules of due process. L... How did you do on your math test? Alfred! I'm sorry, Master Bruce. A touching scene. I would be moved, if I were still capable of it. You don't have to do this. Wayne Enterprises helped save your wife's life... and we can help you. It's too late for that. Much too late. Why? I have some people working for me who can... You were just a boy when you lost your family. But you keep trying to create a surrogate family for yourself. To destroy you, I need only destroy that. Perhaps your beloved surrogate son. No. I think, the surrogate father. This one's for Alfred. No. We're done here. How you doing, Alfred? This chemical bath... is surprisingly soothing. Not at all unpleasant. Good, because you're gonna have to stay in it for a while. Anything from the tracer? Not yet. Sorry I let Freeze get away. I guess I underestimated him. We all did. Got him. Tim, you stay with Alfred. But... I'm quite content by myself, sir. I don't think I'll need anything. See? Except perhaps a spot of tea. Tea? With honey and lemon, if you would. Don't lose that signal. As if. And a few of those lovely tea cookies would do well. I don't get it, this has to be the place. He's here all right. A spare suit? Must be. It's not cold enough in here for him to be running around without one. Batman. You've got to get us out of here. He's a madman. He'll kill us all. Who are you? Doctors. Freeze kidnapped us. He needed us to... That's enough. Hey, Freeze, look who dropped in. Oh, my God. I was hoping to see you again. What happened? The accident that created me... finally took its toll. By the time these doctors stopped my deterioration... all that was left undamaged was this. That's what you meant when you said it was too late for you. Ironic, isn't it? After all I did to keep my wife whole, I end up like this. You understand now why I could not return to my Nora, my treasure. There's no hope for me, or you or your city. Everyone's going to feel my loss. You three may go. You heard me, go, before I change my mind. Well, I guess we're next. Cute. Sorry, my dear, but the time has come for Batman to learn... what it's like to lose the one thing he values most. You'll notice a bomb inside, a reverse-fusion bomb. When I drop it on Gotham... everything within 10 miles will be frozen solid. Blanketing the city in white, silent death. You'll be safe here below ground. Shoot his legs if he moves. I want him alive. I want to see his despair. All right, get your hands up. Always wanted to say that. Go ahead. I can handle this. As much as I want you to see your city frozen and lifeless... I'm quite prepared to end it all right now. Batman, are you reading me? Is everything all right up there? Roger, Batgirl. I think we've seen the last of Mr. Freeze.
