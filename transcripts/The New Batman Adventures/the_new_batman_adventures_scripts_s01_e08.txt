 Hey, now. 
 Check it out. 
 What do we got here? 
 Past your bedtime, ain't it, cutie? 
 What's the matter? Don't you wanna play? 
 Maybe she doesn't like slime. 
 Halloween's over, kid. Now, scram before you get hurt. 
 The girl leaves with me or you're the one getting hurt. 
 What was that? 
 Oh, tough guy. 
 Did you see that? 
 No way. 
 You're going down, kid. 
 You all right? 
 You're welcome. 
 Is that what you're running from? You in trouble with cops? 
 I just wanna help. 
 You can't. I have to keep moving. 
 Is there somewhere I can take you? Do you have a family? 
 I... I can't remember. 
 Wait! 
 This is the third robbery fitting the suspect's description. 
 My men have gone over the evidence with a fine-tooth comb. 
 But we still have no clue to his identity. 
 Given his m.o., I thought you'd wanna be advised. 
 His strength is inhuman, could be chemically induced. 
 There's one good look at him coming up here. 
 He's not in any of our files. 
 He's a stranger to me too. 
 Look at those eyes. How does someone get a face like that? 
 Luck. 
 What? 
 Sorry, I was thinking about a girl. 
 Teenagers. 
 Glad my Barbara's past her wild years. 
 And then she ran off again. 
 Whatever she's running from, it's so bad she's blocked it out. 
 There's nothing we can do for her. 
 From the sound of it, she belongs in a runaway center. 
 And you need to keep your head clear. In this line of work, one slip is too many. 
 He always treats me like a kid. 
 Pardon me for saying so, but you are a kid. 
 Sure, take his side. 
 Alfred, stop. It's her. 
 Master Tim, my instructions are to bring you straight home. 
 Too bad, because Master Tim's left the building. 
 Sorry to bother you at the office, sir. 
 Robert Haney, please come to the information desk in the main lobby. 
 Thank you. Hey, wait up! Where are you going? It's okay. Why do you keep running from me? It's the mask, isn't it? It's not you. I have to keep moving. There's a man after me. Who? I don't know, but he's always there. He's even in my nightmares. Don't worry. I'll help you. What's your name? I can't even remember that. That's okay. We'll improvise. How about Annie? Okay. What's wrong? He's near. I feel him. There! Do you know how long I been looking for you? You were supposed to come right back. Who are you? What do you want? I'm her father, punk. Stay out of it! Oh, I don't think so. I said, out of my way! Let him go. Come on, let's nail this guy. Wait here, okay? Who is this guy? Where'd he go? Annie! Why didn't she wait? I'm going after her. No. We're going home. But this guy's bad news. And she's out there all alone. Searching aimlessly won't help her. Be patient. No. What? I'm not waiting around while you study dirt. If you're not gonna help me, I'll find her myself. You shouldn't be trying so hard to help me. He'll hurt you too. I can handle him. What makes you so sure? I know his type. My dad wasn't much of a prize either. So that's why you care. You're the only person I can remember who ever did. Yeah, but you don't remember anything. 
 
 What is it? That light. It's familiar. Good. Try to remember. I've seen one like it before. I was walking toward it. It was dark... and the ground was uneven. But the light was higher. It was at the top of a tower or something. I think I know just the place. That about right? This all feels familiar. I've been here before. I know it. There, that's it. Those pipes. I remember. Whoa, not so fast. Any luck identifying the young lady's father, sir? Not yet. The computer is still analyzing the mud from his shoe. And Master Robin, any word? I have my eye on him. You still keep a tracer in his utility belt. He's right. You do treat him like a child. Oh, my God. What is it? I know who daddy is. I don't like this. If this is where you lost your memory... we could be walking right into serious trouble. I have to know, Robin. Besides, it won't be the same this time. You're here to protect me. Great. Guess the only way now is forward. He's here. Your father? Finally, you've come back to me. Clayface. Now we can cut out the games. Come on. Come on. Quick. You okay? I understand now. Good, because I'm lost. What do you have to do with Clayface? I am Clayface. I remember now. Clayface had washed out to sea. He couldn't hold his form anymore. He drifted near those pipes, and something in the chemicals made him whole again. But he wasn't strong yet. And he didn't know where he was. So he created me and sent me off to find out if it was safe. I was supposed to look around and then come back. But when I walked away from him, I forgot. Now he wants to take me back. I won't let him. Don't worry. I'll save you. Save what? Don't you see? I'm not real. Yes, you are. No, she's not. You know now. You're part of me. Come home. Stay behind me. Don't let him touch you. I've warned you once, kid. Stay out of this. L... I don't know what to do anymore. Come back to me. It's the only thing you can do. No! Annie, run! That's enough out of you. Wait! I'm the one you want. Annie, don't. No. Run, Robin. Hurry! No! Bring her back. I can't. She's gone. Robin, no! Sometimes there are no happy endings. We'll book him on the robberies and B and E, right? Anything else? Yeah, murder.
