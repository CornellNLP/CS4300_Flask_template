 [Jefferson] Previously on Black Lightning... 
 An anonymous donor has offered to fund the relocation of the clinic from this gang-infested area. 
 [reporter] Councilman Parker, who is it? Who is the donor? 
 If you haven't figured it out yet, you work for me. [laughing] 
 I ran a new simulation and I may have found a way to save all of them. 
 It's working. 
 [alarm blaring] [gasps] 
 [Lynn] No, no. What's happening? 
 [Dr. Jace] I told you what you needed to hear. 
 Fourteen of the vaccine kids will survive. 
 Something happened tonight, Jeff. 
 Gambi was attacked near downtown Freeland. 
 [tires screeching] 
 Eyewitnesses confirm no one got out of the SUV before it exploded. 
 Anaya, aren't you excited it's almost over? 
 Uh, actually, I... I'm terrified. 
 I just need you to do your job so we could be on our way... 
 Deacon! 
 [gasping] My God! 
 Come in. Help! 
 She knows! You have to save the baby! 
 Find Anaya. 
 [groans] Deacon. Come on, no, no, no, Deacon! 
 [police siren chirping] 
 Long way from home, missy. 
 There's a woman who lives out here I need to check on. 
 Step out of the car. 
 Oh, hell no! 
 [kettle whistling] 
 I want you to listen carefully. 
 There's something out there that is of my body but out of my control, I can feel it. 
 I'm sorry, I don't... know what that means. 
 Seriously? You? 
 You don't know what that means? 
 Jake, you told me that I could depend on you to anticipate, to execute. 
 It means everything I built is being threatened. 
 How long have you been a part of me? 
 It's been a while. 
 It's been five years, Jake. I made you special. 
 Look, I'm grateful, Looker, I am. You should be. 
 When I first came to South Freeland, all of you were weak, destroyed, addicted to opioids and meth and anything else that you could get your hands on. 
 Now you live comfortably. 
 You eat well. Your veins are clean. 
 And all I'm asking for is a little appreciation for you to do what I need done without excuses! 
 [gasps] 
 You didn't help us. You made us slaves. 
 You're worse than the drugs, you know, you're worse than the Perdi. 
 [grunts] 
 [choking] 
 [Jake screaming in pain] 
 I want you to follow the element. 
 Follow the senses I gave you. I want to know what this is. 
 [clanks] 
 You're still here? 
 I am. [laughs dryly] 
 [exhales heavily] 
 This is very unprofessional. 
 You come to my home, you do this in front of my family. 
 [dogs whimpering] 
 They'll get over it. 
 Last time. Who hired you to kill me? 
 I don't know who hired me. 
 I got paid. I did the job. 
 Obviously, you didn't do the job, or you wouldn't be sitting there. [sighs] 
 Where'd you get the money? It's not money, it's Bitcoin. 
 It's all done online. 
 Come on, man, you know how this is done. 
 You're right, I do. 
 [groans] 
 Sorry, ladies. 
 Lynn? 
 Lynn, what's going on? 
 She lied to me. 
 Who lied? 
 Dr. Jace. 
 She cooked the data to make it look like the pod kids wouldn't have any adverse reactions. 
 I let it happen. 
 We lost 14 lives, Jeff. 
 Brothers, sisters, sons, daughters. 
 Fourteen kids died and there was nothing I could do about it. 
 All I could do was just... 
 stand there and watch them die. 
 [sobbing] 
 ♪♪ Last night I saw a superhero He was black ♪♪ 
 ♪♪ He said "This is for the street Black Lightning's back" ♪♪ 
 The person I'm representing is offering to relocate the clinic, pay for a new building, and take care of all the associated costs. 
 It's a generous offer, Reverend. 
 [laughs] Yes, it is. 
 And we can definitely use all the help we can get. 
 [Parker] But? 
 But the person you're representing is Tobias Whale... and that's a problem. 
 I don't know what he's got on you, young brother, but I'm gon' pray for you, 'cause you gon' need all the help you can get messing around with Tobias. [laughs] 
 Look here. 
 Let me tell you a little bit about your constituents. 
 You see, the black folk here in Freeland, we always knew Tobias was still here. 
 And we always knew Tobias was runnin' The One Hundred. 
 And I knew it was him and The One Hundred that tried to kill me. 
 Reverend Holt, if you just... Hold on now, listen to me. 
 If I'm wrong... you can take that money and buy your own clinic. 
 Name it after yo' mama for all I care. 
 But you're not getting mine. Understand? 
 Now, if I'm right, and I know I am... 
 you can tell Tobias I said he can keep his money... 
 and he can kiss my holy ass. 
 You understand? 
 [Parker sighs] 
 Good to see you. 
 [Tobias] This is why I don't like hiring negroes. 
 You didn't hire me, you're blackmailing me. 
 You better pray that's all I do to you. 
 The reverend has a point. 
 What do you want with that old building anyway? 
 Why don't you just take your money and build another clinic? 
 Are you trying to tell me how to run my business? 
 No. Not at all. It's just a suggestion. 
 I don't need suggestions, I need results. 
 Kill the reverend. I don't need to hear this. 
 Okay, boss. Hey, let's slow down. 
 Look, killing the reverend who you're trying to buy a building from might not be a good look. 
 I don't care how it looks. 
 It's the only building on the block I don't own. 
 I thought the real estate dude was buyin' up all the land. 
 Is that what you thought? 
 He's just another white face that I own. 
 So stop thinking, you're not very good at it. 
 Just do what I tell you. 
 Okay, but it might... No buts! 
 Hey, you want it to look good? 
 Pop that pimpy-ass preacher and a few of his flock right there in the church. 
 Wait, you... you want me to kill people in church? 
 If that's what it takes. 
 That Christian clown got away once. 
 Let's see if his God will protect him again. 
 Wait. 
 Wait, the march that... 
 That was you? 
 Why're you flapping your thick lips so much? 
 Is there a problem? 
 My mama goes to his church. 
 Aw. Your mama goes to his church. 
 I'm not asking you to kill yo' mama. 
 I'm telling you to kill that sorry-ass excuse of a preacher. 
 Hell, we'd be doing yo' mama and the world a favor. 
 Bottom line, I don't care how you gotta get it done, just kill his ass! 
 Last night, there was a catastrophic incident. 
 Unfortunately, as a result of this incident, 14 of the individuals who were being kept in the stasis in the pods have passed away. 
 [crowd exclaiming] 
 In spite of our best efforts, we were only able to save 14 of the patients who were infected with the original vaccine and four of the patients who were infected with Green Light. 
 Please accept our... My deepest sympathies. 
 Sharice Long, one of the Green Light victims. 
 Is Sharice alive? 
 Um... Uh, she's about 5" 2'. 
 Dimples when she smiles. 
 Unfortunately, I can't answer that right now. 
 Why the hell not? You can tell us 14 died, but you can't tell us who? 
 We can have counselors talk you through the process of identifying your family members. 
 I don't want no white people telling me nothing about my daughter. 
 I'm asking you, sister. 
 Y'all wouldn't be doing us like this if we were white. 
 This has nothing to do with race. Is my daughter alive? 
 Is she alive? Is she alive? 
 [all clamoring] 
 Hey. You okay? 
 No. But I still have work to do. 
 Okay, I'll wait. No, no. It's okay. 
 You go home. I'll finish up here. 
 [newscaster] And in world news, after the mysterious death of King Victor, the war in Markovia rages on. 
 Factions loyal to the royal family fight against insurmountable odds. 
 And in local news, another incident featuring the so-called Green Light Babies... 
 [beeping] 
 [whirring] 
 [tires screeching] 
 [beeps] 
 [newscaster] Deputy Chief Henderson and a team of snipers arrived on the scene using tranquilizer darts to subdue the woman. 
 This marks the seventh such incident in the last eight weeks. 
 [alert beeping] - So far, the authorities, along with Black Lightning... 
 [beeping continues] - There's a growing fear within the Freeland community that these Green Light babies have become an epidemic that even our meta-human protectors 
 - might not be able to... What the hell? 
 [gun cocks] 
 [gun cocks] 
 I'm, uh... just looking for Anaya. 
 [door closes] 
 What's your name, sweetheart? Anissa. 
 How do you spell it? A-N-I-S-S-A. 
 French spelling for an Arabic name, which means "lovable." 
 What do you want with our daughter, Anissa? 
 You're... you're Anaya's parents? 
 I just want to help her. 
 Oh, my God. Anaya, are you okay? 
 [knocks] 
 Okay, okay. 
 Of course she's okay. How do you know our daughter? 
 She came into the clinic where I work. 
 Ma'am, I just wanna make sure she's okay. 
 We appreciate your dedication, but she's fine. 
 No, she's not. She's in danger. 
 She's in danger. What kind of danger? 
 I'm not sure, but... 
 Anaya, I'm sorry... 
 but Deacon is dead. 
 [gasps] 
 [Anaya] Deacon? 
 [Anaya stifles sob] 
 [Anaya gasping] 
 [groaning] 
 [Anaya wheezing] 
 What's the matter, baby? Sweetheart! 
 She's going into labor. We need to get her to a bed. 
 Here, help her get to bed. Help her. 
 It's okay, baby. Mommy's right here. 
 [tires screeching] 
 [thud] [gasps] 
 Hey! [gasps] 
 Is she alive? 
 Is she alive? 
 I'm sorry! I don't know, I'm sorry. 
 Is she dead? Miss? Miss? No, is she dead? 
 Please! Please! Miss! Miss! 
 Miss! 
 Miss! 
 [crying] 
 [sighs] 
 [Khalil sighs] 
 [Jennifer] Look, I know you didn't come all the way up here just to sit next to me and not say nothing. 
 Is that what we're doing now? 
 Khalil, what's wrong? 
 [sighs] Tobias is the reason why I was paralyzed. 
 What? 
 He was behind the reverend getting shot. 
 Oh, God. 
 [scoffs] 
 All this time I've been blaming Black Lightning. 
 And now Tobias, he wants me to kill the reverend. 
 [scoffs] 
 Khalil, why are you still staying with him? 
 Jen, look at the choices that I made. 
 It's not like I have anywhere else to go. 
 [sighs] I'm sorry you have to deal with all this alone. 
 Hey, we'll figure it out. 
 Yo, why are you even giving me the time of day? 
 This whole Painkiller thing is not you. 
 We've all been through a lot. 
 Plus, I don't want you to make any more mistakes, 'cause you've made some bad decisions this year. Like, really bad. 
 I also made some good ones, too. 
 [laughing] Oh, yeah? Like what? 
 All right, Anaya, push for me one more time. 
 Anaya, push for me, okay? Push! 
 [grunting] Push, Anaya! 
 [screaming] 
 Yes! Push! 
 Push! Push for me! 
 [Batina] You're doing pretty good. 
 [crying] [Anissa] Okay, okay. Okay. 
 All right. Okay. Breathe. I'm right here, okay? 
 [baby wailing] 
 [Batina exclaims in delight] 
 You did it. You did it. 
 [Batina laughing] 
 Okay, okay. 
 Hi. Hi, baby! 
 [gasps, screaming] 
 [Batina] What's wrong? I don't know. I don't know. 
 What's wrong? I don't know. I don't know. 
 [wails] 
 [Batina] Is she all right? 
 [panting] 
 [continues wailing] 
 [stutters] She's still having contractions! 
 [gasping violently] 
 Oh, my God! She's having twins! 
 [sighs] Anissa? 
 [monitor beeping] 
 What are you doing? 
 [exhales] 
 Is that apple juice? [chuckles] 
 I'm not in the mood for your smart little mouth, little girl. 
 Sorry. 
 [Jennifer clears throat] 
 Those families think I'm some kind of government sellout. 
 Well, that's how people looked at me in school. 
 "The Queen of Garfield." And I hated it. 
 But I knew they were wrong. So I just ignored 'em. 
 Maybe you should do the same thing. 
 I wish it was that easy. 
 The baby is breech. And it's stuck in the back of the uterus. 
 I need you to apply pressure. Right here. 
 Okay. Just like this. Okay? 
 What the hell are you doing? 
 What? 
 You and Dad told me and Anissa to always be honest and take responsibility for our actions. 
 Yeah. 
 And even though I didn't ask for these powers, it's still my responsibility to control them, right? 
 What are you trying to say? 
 [sighs] Okay, if we're being honest, it wasn't your fault those kids died. 
 But technically, as the person in charge of the facility, it was your responsibility to keep them safe. 
 So once again, even though it was not your fault that they died, they kinda were your responsibility. You see what I'm saying? 
 Wow. [chuckles] 
 Well, thank you for your honesty. 
 Wait, Mom. Mom, that's not... 
 You got it, baby! You got it! Breathe! 
 That's my strong girl! [Anissa] Breathe! Breathe! 
 Breathe! 
 [gasps] 
 [baby crying] 
 [Anissa] There you go, there you go. 
 Okay. 
 Here's your baby. Okay. 
 You did it, Anaya. 
 [Joshua] No. 
 [Batina] Joshua. 
 What did you do? 
 You killed Deacon? 
 She chose his pale ass over me? 
 Me? 
 You just started a war. 
 [breathing shakily] 
 [baby fussing] 
 [electrical humming] 
 Whoa. 
 [Lynn retches] 
 [coughing] 
 [sighs] 
 [toilet flushing] 
 [Lynn retching] 
 [Lynn panting, sniffles] 
 [toilet flushing] 
 I could never let half of those kids die, even if I knew it would save the other half. 
 When I look at them, all I see is you and Anissa. 
 I know, Mom. 
 I would've tried to save every single one of them. 
 If we could've found a way to save 14 lives, we could've found a way to save all of them. 
 Every single life mattered. 
 Every single one. 
 [crying] 
 [Reverend Holt] It's a good night out here. 
 [chuckles] Ooh! 
 My Lord! 
 [speaks indistinctly] 
 [humming] 
 What the... 
 Hey! 
 If you don't leave Freeland tonight, you are going to die. 
 Well, let me tell you something, boy. 
 You better take your hands off me... 
 [grunts] before I beat your... [gasps] 
 Okay? 
 You think you're a gangster now, huh? 
 Huh? 
 I knew your mama when she was pregnant with you, boy. 
 Now, this ain't you, Khalil. Now let me go. 
 Huh? 
 
 
 
 You have to leave Freeland! 
 I ain't gotta do nothing but stay black and die! 
 [breathing heavily] 
 [chokes] 
 [continues choking] 
 [Khalil grunts] 
 So you can walk now, huh? 
 But you walking down the wrong path, Khalil. 
 Come on, son. 
 All these things you doing out here in the streets will tear your mother apart. 
 It's too late for me. 
 It's never too late. 
 Not for Jesus. 
 God will forgive you, Khalil. You know He will. 
 I wish Deacon could've met them. 
 I know it was too dangerous for us to be together. 
 I just want them to be safe. 
 What is... What is Sange? 
 White folks with powers who basically terrorize South Freeland. 
 They call us the Perdi. 
 So they call black folks out here Perdi? 
 Yeah. We lived with the whites in South Freeland, them on their side, us in the woods, since the end of slavery. 
 The Sange have been running guns out of South Freeland proper for the last 30 years while we stayed in the surrounding woods and made money off of the land. 
 So y'all really live in the woods? 
 Yeah. We're farmers. We grow organic fruits, vegetables, hemp. 
 Weed? That, too. 
 There's a lady who calls herself Looker. 
 My dad says she came to town about 30 years ago. 
 And she has this silver, which she calls element. 
 She used it to turn the white folks into Sange. 
 Is that the stuff that came out of Deacon? 
 And it's in the babies, too. 
 In my father's eyes, having a baby by a Sange, that's about the worst thing I could do. 
 Yeah, but I'm sure he'll come around. 
 No. This is serious, Anissa. 
 My father hates white people, especially the Sange. 
 For as long as I can remember, the Sange have hated us, and the Perdi have hated them. 
 And now I'm having twins with a Sange. 
 My father will never forgive me. 
 [Anaya crying] 
 [footsteps approaching] 
 I didn't get the reverend. 
 There were too many people around. 
 I'll get him next time. 
 [Tobias] In the elite units of the armed forces, there's a theory of operations called "unit cohesion." 
 According to this theory, there's two types of cohesion. 
 There's tactical, or task cohesion, and social cohesion. 
 Tactical cohesion is defined as a shared commitment amongst a group to achieve a goal, while social cohesion is how well the members of that team get along. 
 Now, the key to this theory is keeping a balance between the two. 
 However, if one of those components is too far out of whack, the team breaks down. 
 Well, unless someone intercedes. 
 Truth be told, I owe you an apology. 
 It's my fault you failed. 
 Seems our social cohesion has surpassed our tactical. 
 The fact that I'm fond of you has kept me from interceding and disciplining you the way that I should. 
 And for that, I am very sorry. 
 But I promise you. Oh, you have my word, Khalil. 
 I won't ever let it happen again. 
 [Tobias grunts] 
 I've been waiting to beat your pasty ass. 
 [both grunting] 
 [grunts, laughs] 
 You hit as soft as you look. 
 [yells] 
 [panting] 
 [grunting] 
 [grunts] 
 Get your ass up. 
 You all right, son? 
 [clangs] [groans] 
 Get your ass up. 
 You will kill Reverend Holt and your mama! 
 [chuckling] 
 You all right? Huh? 
 Or I will kill you! 
 You smart-ass. 
 [laughs] 
 One way or the other, you gonna learn. Yeah. 
 [glass cracking] 
 [shattering] 
 You done broke my damn fish tank. 
 [breathing heavily] 
 Looker is much stronger than anyone under her control, almost impossible to hurt. 
 If Looker knew Deacon and I have children, she will feel the same way as my father. 
 Deacon used to say if the Sange and Perdi were to intermingle, realize we have more in common than we don't, it would threaten her control over town. 
 He said most Sange don't want the element. 
 Do you think she'll come after the babies? 
 Yeah. 
 Okay, okay. Now I just want you to get some rest. All right? 
 You've been through a lot. It's gonna be okay. 
 I know you're in your feelings right now, but we need to get Anaya and those babies out of the woods and somewhere safe where we can protect them. 
 Look, y'all are sitting here with your old-ass ideas about who should be with who, but, you know, that's still your daughter in there, and, black or white, those are still your grandbabies. 
 Now, you and Anaya can work out your issues after they're safe, but there won't be any issues to work out if they all die. 
 Why do you care what happens to this family? 
 Because I was raised that way. 
 If anything goes wrong, we split up and meet at the farmhouse. 
 Each group is responsible for getting one of the babies to Freeland. Understand? 
 [all] Copy. 
 [air whooshing] 
 [whooshes] 
 [guns cocking] 
 Took you long enough. 
 We're gonna talk about this later, young lady. 
 [newscaster] The new Park Street library is going to be open... 
 [continues speaking indistinctly] [laptop chiming] 
 [indistinct yelling] 
 [screams] 
 [car engine starts] 
 [man 1] Come on, we gotta go! [man 2] Get in, let's go! 
 [groans] 
 [gun cocks] 
 [gun cocks] 
 [shouts] 
 [gun fires] 
 [man 3] Look out! Behind you! 
 [men screaming] 
 Where's your parents? They haven't made it back yet. 
 None of them have. The baby? 
 [Anissa over comms] I've got Anaya and the baby and we're headed to Freeland. 
 [Black Lightning] I found something. - What? 
 Dad, what's going on? 
 [sighs] There's a lot of dead bodies. 
 What about the baby? 
 I don't see her. 
 What about the grandparents? Uh, her dad has grey locks, and her mom has short hair like Mom. 
 I don't see them either. 
 There's something here... a silver liquid... that's moving on its own. I think it's from Looker. 
 Wait. What is that? 
 This woman that the babies' mother, Anaya, told me about. 
 Now, Anaya says that this silver liquid is like a part of Looker and she can put it inside of people and make them Sange. 
 Make them what? 
 Sange. 
 Like her slaves, basically. 
 She also said that this element, it gives the Sange more speed and strength than regular folks. 
 Sounds like a meta. 
 Anaya said she showed up in South Freeland about 30 years ago. 
 Thirty years ago? 
 So she might be one of the original kids infected by the vaccine. 
 So she's just like you. 
 What? No. I wouldn't say just like me, but yeah. 
 Wow. 
 Sounds like I may not be the only vaccine kid who's been out and about. 
 All right, Dad, look. According to Anaya, this silver liquid always returns to Looker. 
 Now, if that's true, you should be able to follow it back to her and hopefully find the grandparents and the baby. 
 This is some weird stuff. 
 I know. 
 Okay, get Anaya and the other baby to safety. 
 Anissa? [Anissa] Yeah? 
 Good job. 
 If you hadn't shown up tonight, a lot more people would be dead, including those babies. 
 Thanks, Dad. Hey, Dad? 
 Yeah? Be careful. 
 Yeah, always. 
 What're you doing down there? 
 [Khalil] Nothing. I just wanted to hear your voice. 
 Okay. Well, you didn't have to come all the way here for that. 
 Why are you acting so weird? Are you okay? 
 [Khalil] Yeah. Yeah, I'm fine. 
 Khalil, come up here so I can see you. 
 Nah, I'm good down here. 
 All right, boy, if you don't stop playing with me, I'm going back inside and I'm hanging up. 
 Wait, wait. Don't do that. 
 Then come up here. 
 [sighs] 
 Wait. Jen... 
 What happened? 
 Reverend Holt won't leave Freeland. 
 Jen, I'm not Tobias. 
 I am not a killer. That's not me. 
 No, I know. I know. 
 I appreciate everything that you've done for me. 
 Wait, why are you talking like I'm not gonna see you again? 
 Look at you... No. 
 [baby gurgling] 
 What the hell am I supposed to do with this thing? 
 A Sange been lying with a Perdi? 
 Hmm? 
 Who? 
 Where's Deacon? 
 One of the Perdi found out the girl had a baby by one of us. 
 Killed him. Tried to make it look like we did it. 
 Lie down with the Perdi, die like the Perdi, hmm? 
 [baby cooing] 
 [breathes deeply] 
 [gasps] 
 There's another baby. A white baby. 
 Find it. 
 [closing theme music playing]
