 [Jefferson] Previously on Black Lightning... 
 [Lynn] Anissa came by with a box of Alvin's research. 
 I didn't have a chance to look through it, but I did come across some pretty advanced biochemical formulas. 
 [Eve] Dr. Lynn Stewart is highly capable. 
 And she's been doing research that's off-limits. 
 It's either her or you. You understand that? 
 If I kill Lady Eve without the Shadow Board's permission, I might as well bury myself with her. 
 Not necessarily. 
 [newscaster] Evelyn Stillwater-Ferguson was killed by electrocution, making Black Lightning their prime suspect. 
 Latavious, that is enough! 
 You know my damn name! 
 [grunting] [yelps] 
 [choking] 
 [gasps] 
 Do you believe in the Resurrection, Latavious? 
 [groaning loudly] [flesh searing] 
 [groans] 
 Anissa? 
 You can't afford to lose your head. 
 That's when people get hurt. 
 Then train me. Show me how to do this. 
 You're clearly not ready. 
 Eventually, she will go back out there, whether we like it or not. 
 Training her is the right thing to do. 
 [Cayman on TV] And our search for Black Lightning has expanded to include another five officers. 
 Freeland PD won't rest until Lady Eve's murderer is brought to justice. 
 MAN 1: She was a good woman, did a lot for us. 
 I told people when Black Lightning came back, all he's doing is beating up on young black men. 
 Now he's out here killing black women? 
 What's next? Little kids and babies? 
 [grunting] 
 MAN 2: Why you think he hiding behind that mask? 
 'Cause he know he trippin', man. 
 Like, I understand fighting The Hundred... but Lady Eve? 
 That's wrong, man. 
 I got you, old man. 
 [scoffs] [chuckles] 
 Yeah. 
 Urban mix. 
 [woman groans]

 [man 1 groans]

 ♪♪ Everybody was Kung Fu fighting ♪♪ I don't see him as no damn hero. 
 He's worse than these crooked-ass police in Freeland. 
 [both grunting] 
 I feel like wherever he was before he came back, that's where he should've stayed. 
 [electricity buzzing] 
 [inhales heavily] [rumbles] 
 [man 2 groaning] [Jefferson] Freeze. 
 Freeze? 
 He might be racist, but he wasn't a threat. 
 And you probably broke his ankle and maybe gave him a concussion. 
 The flag on the T-shirt. 
 No, I know why it happened. 
 You looked and you assumed he was a threat, so you didn't actually see that he wasn't. 
 [sighs] 
 Look, our goal is to stop crime and violence with no harm to civilians, even if... we don't appreciate their worldview. 
 You... 
 [Jefferson clears throat] 
 You can't be reactive, going around smashing whatever statues you feel like. 
 Picking fights with punks from Garfield. 
 No. You have to be in control. 
 Every minute. 
 I'm not perfect, nobody is. 
 All right, you ready? 
 Brace yourself. [clears throat] 
 Hold your breath. 
 [inhales heavily] 
 This attempt at framing me, you know what it proves? 
 I'm getting under someone's skin. 
 I'm guessing it's about Green Light. 
 Mmm-hmm. 
 And we are getting close to shutting it down. 
 [inhales sharply] 
 And since the police will be looking for me... 
 What... Hey. 
 You can't be startled. 
 Ever. 
 You have to see into the shadows, look around corners, because if you breathe at the wrong time, you die. 
 Got it? 
 Yeah, I got it. 
 All right, well, since the police are looking for me, I'm sure with a shoot-to-kill mentality, so we have to clear Black Lightning before I can get back in the suit. 
 Okay. Okay, first training mission, we find whoever killed Lady Eve. 
 Now you listen to me, do whatever I tell you, and hopefully you will learn a few things. 
 You ready? Yep. Ready.

 Hey, no, man, nobody invited you up in our... 
 Oh. 
 What's up, boss? 
 We was just using the stage because... 
 Nobody was. 
 Ever since that shootout, Tobias ain't been around, so we weren't sure if we was... That sounded good. 
 And that's what's up. 
 Where you been at, Lala? 
 They told us you wasn't coming back. 
 Who's "they"? 
 There were rumors. 
 "Rumors"? 
 Yeah, like, you were in jail or... 
 Or what? 
 That you were dead. 
 "Dead"? 
 Yeah, I think I was.

 I regret not killing Black Lightning the minute he returned. 
 It was the logical choice based on what we knew. 
 And now Lady Eve is dead. 
 We can't be sure he killed her. 
 She and her bodyguards were fried with electricity. 
 What other proof do you need? 
 Someone could have set him up. 
 Who would do that? I don't know, I just... 
 I value your counsel, Peter, and I usually appreciate your measured approach, not today. 
 He was a nuisance, now he's a danger to me, to you, to the ASA. 
 I've put a price on his black ass. 
 That's a mistake, Martin. 
 If we catch him, who knows how he could advance our understanding of enhanced human abilities? 
 We should just wait... 
 ASA's dissected enough metas. 
 One more isn't going to help us create our own. 
 Lady Eve was the liaison between us and The One Hundred. 
 She got Green Light on the streets faster than anyone in the country. 
 Her murder sets the Freeland experiment back. 
 Yes, that's true, but there's no harm in making sure that killing Black Lightning is the right thing to do before we do it. 
 I don't like power I don't control. 
 When Black Lightning returned, you said you would figure out who he was and take care of him. 
 You didn't, so I'm bringing ASA operatives into town to kill him, plain and simple. 
 Give me any information you have that will help them track him down. 
 Martin... I'm sick of this neighborhood, Peter. 
 They don't take care of it, the food is all fried. 
 The only thing the people here are good for is experimentation. 
 They should be happy we're here. 
 Green Light will give their lives purpose, direction. 
 We're doing God's work, Peter. 
 God's work. 
 [engine starts] 
 Jennifer already eat? 
 [Lynn] No, I don't think so. 
 She's upstairs moping. 
 [scoffs] I told her that until she finds an appropriate after-school activity, she'd have to do an unpaid internship at my lab. 
 Ouch. 
 Well, I figured cleaning up after the break-in might drive her back to track. 
 Yeah, or teach her how to pick up after herself. 
 I'd settle for that one. 
 Yeah. 
 How was training? 
 It's good. 
 It's okay that I asked, right? 
 And there's no code that says a mother can't know how her daughter's doing with her powers. 
 No, no. Look, I know... 
 I know how hard this is for you. 
 A million times worse than watching our kids learn how to ride bikes. 
 Scraped foreheads I can handle, but the thought that she might not... 
 No. Uh-uh, uh-uh. 
 No catastrophic thoughts. 
 Hmm? 
 Besides, she is really taking it seriously. 
 'Cause she wants an A or because she thinks it's important? 
 Well, I think because she knows I won't let her go out with me if she doesn't. 
 [chuckles softly] 
 Look, right now, I'm just trying to help her understand that she's not invincible, so she doesn't hurt herself or someone else. 
 You know Anissa's problem, it's the same as it always is. 
 She reacts, usually from an emotional place, without thinking about the consequences. 
 Do you remember in second grade... Hmm. 
 ...when she got suspended... 
 Oh. ...for kicking her teacher 
 'cause she thought he made her friend cry? 
 [both laugh] Yes. Oh, yes. 
 [Jefferson exhales] 
 [laughs] Yeah. 
 The stakes are different now. 
 How do you train someone to be what they're not? 
 She has her mother's brains. 
 It won't take her long to realize that if she wants to change the world, she has to change herself. 
 Why can't Kam help us? 
 Because Kam has a PhD and better things to do than clean up after the break-in. 
 Okay, well, you have a PhD and an MD. 
 That's true. Maybe I should let you do it yourself. 
 That's not what I meant. 
 No, I know what you meant. 
 What you meant is this is boring and you'd rather be doing something else. 
 Right. That's... That's what I meant. 
 Look, just because you dropped your activities does not mean your father and I are going to let you spend all your free time texting with your friends. 
 So, what's up with Dad and Anissa? 
 What do you mean? You haven't noticed? 
 They've been acting really weird, at least around me. 
 [sighs] They were mad at each other, and wouldn't tell me why. 
 And now it seems like they're 98 and two, but sharing some kind of secret. 
 Something's going on. 
 Look, everything's fine. 
 Families go through stuff. It's normal. 
 Wait, did... did you see any old papers in here? 
 No. 
 On yellow legal pages? They were kinda crumpled. 
 Still no. 
 They're all gone. 
 What's gone? 
 Uh... 
 I have to pick something up. 
 You're free to go home. 
 Yes. 
 Oh, um... 
 Can I hang up posters with Kiesha at the school? 
 Yeah, but then go home. 
 Um, it'll be sort of late. 
 Okay. Okay. 
 Okay, what are you hoping to find? 
 I don't know. 
 But the police have already cleaned up the crime scene, and Gambi said the official report is short on details, [on speakers] so Lady Eve's body is the only evidence we have to look at right now. 
 Which doesn't mean this is a good idea. 
 [Jefferson] Look, you said the building was empty and you picked a route that would keep us off camera surveillance, so... 
 I did say those things, but I just meant in general. 
 I heard a rumor that there's a big reward out for Black Lightning's capture. 
 Oh, yes, this is the perfect time to give me that bit of information. 
 Who's putting up the money? 
 I don't know. 
 We're at the janitor's closet. Now what? 
 The spot you want is just ahead, below the vent. 
 Okay. 
 And this is where Gambi says is the best place to break in. 
 All right. 
 [inhales heavily] Whoa, whoa, whoa. 
 How much force do you need? 
 [exhales] 
 Uh... enough to get through the wall. 
 And how much is that? 
 I don't know. 
 Tap it with your finger. 
 Okay. 
 [inhales heavily] 
 Okay. 
 Clearly, that wasn't it. 
 Whatever you think. 
 [clears throat] 
 [inhales heavily] 
 Okay, maybe I could've used a little less. 
 You think? 
 [sighs] 
 [Anissa clears throat] 
 [both] Twins? 
 All right, let's see. 
 A-ha! [Jefferson] Yeah? 
 Looks like they'll pick her up tomorrow. 
 Good thing we came tonight. 
 Oh. 
 All right, Gambi, you seeing this? 
 [Gambi] Yeah, I got it. 
 [Jefferson] Pick up her arm. 
 Her arm? 
 Gently. 
 Go on. 
 When you work with cadavers in school, do you ever think about who they were? 
 No. 
 Yeah, well, she had a life, family. 
 You know, yesterday, she might have been making a grocery list, planning a family get-together, and then someone killed her, for whatever their reasons, not caring about who would be left behind to mourn the loss of her passing. 
 And even if you do care, people are gonna die just the same if you don't learn to modulate your powers. 
 More importantly, your mother, Jennifer and myself will mourn the loss if you get killed 
 - because you weren't vigilant. Jefferson. 
 So you need to stay woke, Anissa, always. 
 Jefferson. What? 
 Oh... If she had been killed by a lightning strike or a Black Lightning strike, Dad, there'd be a tree pattern on her skin. 
 [sighs in relief] 
 What she said. It's called Lichtenberg scarring. 
 It's a fractal pattern that occurs when electricity passes through an insulating material. 
 This is more of a burn, like it was caused by a high-voltage flash. 
 So this was caused by some kind of a weapon? 
 [Gambi] I believe so. 
 Black Lightning's never killed anyone, so I understand how the coroner wouldn't know what kind of wound pattern he might create. 
 How much power would a weapon like this take? 
 A billion joules. 
 Well, how would you do that in something portable? 
 With nuclear power. 
 You can track radiation, right? 
 Which means we might be able to find the weapon that killed her. 
 Yes. 
 Okay, we're done here. 
 Um... 
 All right, brains, not brawn. 
 Good job, Anissa. Let's go. 
 [knocks] 
 Hey. 
 We are closed. 
 Please. It's important. 
 I can't accept any samples. 
 Well, I'm here for a report on something I dropped off a few days ago. 
 [sighs] We had a break-in. 
 What? Yeah. 
 Got some equipment stolen, a whole bunch of samples. 
 They screwed up our computers. 
 Cops think it was junkies looking for drugs and stuff to sell. 
 We just started notifying people, but I might not have what you came for. 
 Can you check to see if my sample was affected? 
 Yeah. It's for Doctor Lynn Stewart. 
 It was a powder. 
 I asked you to do an X-ray crystallography. 
 [sighs] 
 Yeah, it looks like your sample was one of the ones taken, and the results file was corrupted when they trashed our computers. 
 You must have a backup. 
 Partitioned on the same drive. I'm really sorry. 
 There must be a printout. 
 I always print a hard copy when I'm double-checking my results. 
 These guys made a real mess. It could take... 
 What? 
 We've had someone on maternity leave for the last month. 
 I'm really behind. 
 Maybe there's a copy in the "to-be-filed" folder. 
 Oh, could you check? Please. 
 Yeah. Thank you. 
 You know, I'm not one to judge a person's extracurricular activities, but I don't know how you ended up with student government. 
 Whoever controls the money controls the school, so... 
 Oh, so, this is a power play? 
 Yeah. Just like your mama making you work in her lab. 
 Nah, she's just worried I won't get into Harvard if I'm sitting around texting you. 
 Oh, That's cute. Ah, thank you. 
 Wait, you're applying to Harvard? 
 Not the point. 
 Okay. 
 [laughs] Send it to me. 
 Okay. 
 [Kiesha] Ooh. 
 [ladder rattles] 
 Hey, what you doing? 
 I'm gonna put one up here so nobody takes it down. 
 No, Kiesha, that's dumb. 
 Get down before you kill yourself. 
 [Kiesha] Getting kidnapped made you so emo. 
 Getting kidnapped didn't make me emo. You're making me emo. 
 Kiesha, I'm serious. 
 [Kiesha] Oh, my God. 
 That's really unsafe, you need to get down. 
 I'm serious. 
 Kiesha, please. [yelping] 
 Kiesha! [gasps] 
 [crackling] 
 [gasping] 
 Okay, I'm fine. 
 Damn, girl, you dropped your phone. 
 Yeah, scared you were gonna break your neck. 
 Ah, no. Hey, now you got an excuse to get a new one. 
 I'm thinking maybe I should change my slogan. 
 "I bounce, so our class money won't have to." 
 [music playing] 
 So, now that you're back, what's your plan? 
 I don't know yet. 
 [LaWanda] The man without a plan. 
 You know word on the street is you're dead, right? 
 And that one's trying to take your spot. 
 Ain't nobody can take my spot. 
 Dead or alive. 
 [scoffs] 
 I can't believe you letting these dudes drive you home. 
 You do understand they'll know where you live, right? 
 They cool. 
 How can you know that for sure? 
 You killed me for putting a camera in your face. 
 I told you to take your ass home. 
 So when they come for you, you going to kill them, too? 
 I don't know yet. 
 I might. 
 But they won't come for me. 
 Nah. I don't think you should wait. 
 I don't trust them. 
 Especially that one. 
 You definitely should kill him right now. 
 [Lala] Kill my dude? 
 [LaWanda] Yeah. 
 He's driving the car. You want to crash? 
 LaWanda, you crazy. [chuckles] 
 I'm good. 
 I'm just saying, people turn. 
 I said I'm good. 
 Everything cool, Lala? 
 Yeah. 
 [Anissa] So, this satellite tracks radiation? 
 Yes. Everywhere in the world? 
 [sighs] 
 The two of you continuing this investigation is a bad idea, even if you're not dressed as Black Lightning and Thunder. 
 We have to clear Black Lightning's name. 
 Yes. [Gambi] I agree, but please, let me do it. 
 If you get caught digging into Lady Eve's murder, someone could put two and two together and realize who you are. 
 Then I will make sure that doesn't happen. 
 Yes, let's go then. 
 Yo, wait. Wait. When you power up, are you susceptible to radiation? 
 I don't know. 
 Chemicals? I don't know. 
 Okay, what about water? 
 Are you like a witch? Do you sink or can you swim? 
 I don't know. You don't know a lot. 
 [Gambi sighs] 
 What are you waiting for? 
 You, to come to your senses. 
 [scoffs] 
 [Jefferson] Wait, that's Lady Eve being killed. 
 Oh, that's Hampton Woods. What are they doing out there? 
 I don't know. But please, let me go check it out. 
 You're not putting me in any danger. 
 There's no bounty on me, and I can take care of myself. 
 No, I need to train Anissa, Gambi. 
 Besides, I can take care of myself, too. 
 So, unless you can tell me a reason why this is more dangerous than all the other crazy things you let me do over the years... 
 I'm just trying to help you. 
 Which I appreciate, but I can handle it. 
 You're just so damn stubborn, Jefferson. 
 Gambi! 
 [computer trilling] 
 [Anissa] Dad, you know how I feel about the woods. 
 No. Black people die in the woods. 
 [device beeps] Yes, in horror movies, but only after the monster kills the white nerd. [laughs] 
 And we don't have one of those with us, so you're good. 
 [Jefferson chuckles] 
 Okay. [cell phone vibrating] 
 Wait, hold on. 
 Hey, Lynn. - Hi. 
 I found something disturbing, I guess is the right word. 
 Are you okay? 
 [Lynn] I'm fine. 
 That sample Anissa brought over from your father's investigation, I analyzed it, and it's a vaccine. 
 A vaccine? 
 For what? - I'm not sure. 
 But what I am sure about is the components of the vaccine are the same active ingredients in Green Light. 
 Wait, the sample Anissa found was from 1986. 
 Are you saying someone's been working on Green Light for 30 years? 
 It looks like it. 
 [sighs] 
 Okay, well, if we figure out who produced the vaccine, then maybe we can find out who's behind all this. 
 
 
 
 Well, I tried, but I've struck out with my pool of doctors and health officials. 
 Thirty years is a long time ago. 
 You know what, talk to Gambi. 
 He's been in Freeland almost as long. 
 He may not know anything, but he'll know someone who knows something. 
 - And, Lynn? Yeah? 
 Please be careful. 
 Of course.

 [Anissa] So, once you realized you had powers, how long until you decided to become Black Lightning? 
 Uh, I did a few things here and there, but it took me a while before I committed and got the suit. 
 Why'd you stop all those years? 
 [device beeps] That's complicated. 
 Mom, right? 
 That's between me and her. 
 Which is a "yes." Yeah. 
 But an "ask your mother" yes. 
 So, who trained you? 
 Gambi. Fighting and tactics. Oh. 
 Even before I knew I had powers. 
 And why is so he mad at you right now? 
 No, no. He's not mad. He's worried. 
 That's how he gets when I don't do what he wants me to. 
 Sarcastic Italian, that's how he shows his love. 
 [both chuckle] [device beeping] 
 Wait, hold on. It should be right around here. 
 Right there. [device beeping rapidly] 
 I guess we can be grateful for the second rule of high-profile assassinations. 
 Always kill the killer. 
 [sighs] Okay. What now? 
 I call Henderson. 
 This is evidence. 
 Black Lightning doesn't get exonerated unless Freeland PD conducts an investigation and clears him. 
 Whoa, you call him on that? 
 I mean, was carrying a tin can attached to a string too bulky? 
 [laughs sarcastically] 
 [laughs] This is current technology. 
 Okay. 
 Let me see that. 
 Yo, Henderson. 
 You got a pencil and paper? 
 Hampton Woods, coordinates 33, 47, 84, 43. 
 You'll find a shallow grave, a body, and the weapon that actually killed Lady Eve. 
 Heyo, tell the morgue to hold the body so you can match the wound. 
 You're welcome. 
 I know you didn't say thank you. 
 It's implied in your loud-ass questions. 
 [chuckles] 
 [chuckles] 
 Does he know you're Black Lightning? 
 No. That would put him in an impossible position. 
 Yeah, because of that lame cell phone. 
 [laughing] 
 [sighs] 
 Okay. 
 [grunts] 
 [sighs] 
 [exhales] 
 [crackling] [gasps] 
 [flesh searing] 
 [bell chiming] 
 [Gambi] I'll be right there. 
 Gambi, it's Lynn. 
 Take your time. 
 I was hoping you could help me with something. 
 [chuckles softly] 
 [Gambi] I, uh... 
 I hope your help involves the silk damask because my supplier accidentally left me two bolts of it. 
 I'm afraid not. 
 Yeah. Well, then let's pray purple suits come back into fashion. 
 [chuckles] What do you need? 
 Well, I've been doing some analysis of a vaccine from 30 years ago. 
 That's a long time ago. Why the interest now? 
 Well, I just got the sample. 
 It was in a box of research for a series of articles that Alvin was writing. 
 Alvin Pierce? 
 Yeah. 
 Turns out that the vaccine's related to Green Light. 
 But I want to know where it came from. 
 Problem is, it's so old, there's no information about the drug company that developed it. 
 Do you remember a doctor or a clinic director who was working in the community back then? 
 No. 
 Well, a vaccine has to be government-approved. 
 Did you have any contacts that maybe might be able to answer... Lynn. 
 I can't talk about this. 
 Thirty years ago. 
 You moved here around the time the vaccine came to Freeland. 
 You never talk about your life before Freeland. 
 No. You never wanted to share anything. 
 We assumed you had your reasons. 
 I did. Gambi, Jefferson trusts you. 
 I know. 
 I think... [voice breaks] 
 I think it's time for me to have a talk with him. 
 Excuse me, Lynn. 
 Okay, I've finally realized the most important part of a stakeout. 
 Go to the bathroom first? 
 Uh, that would have helped a lot more 
 [chuckles] than all of your "you're going to die" talk. 
 [leaves rustling] 
 Whoa, whoa, whoa. 
 Dad. There's somebody over there. 
 Wait, wait, wait. That's not right. 
 What's not? 
 Well, Henderson would have sent uniformed officers to secure the scene, a crime scene unit, not a lone person in street clothes. 
 [Anissa] Okay, well, then who is he? 
 [sighs] 
 Freeland PD is full of dirty cops. 
 So, I'm guessing someone must've intercepted Henderson's dispatch and sent him first. 
 All right, stay here. 
 - Stay here? Dad, I should go with you. No, no. Stay here. 
 I'm just going to see what he's doing. I... 
 I can disable him from a distance if I have to. 
 Stay here. 
 [sighs] 
 Wait. 
 [weapon whirring, beeping] 
 [panting] 
 Dad! I told you... 
 [inhales heavily] 
 Dad, I could tell he didn't know that those weapons were dangerous. 
 Whoever sent him, they thought he was expendable. 
 He just didn't know. 
 I spent all this time telling her she had to anticipate danger or she'd die, and then I failed to anticipate danger and almost get myself killed. 
 [Jefferson chuckles] 
 She has to understand her powers, and I can help her with that. 
 Mmm. 
 But I was trying to change her. 
 Her understanding of people, her desire to protect. 
 No, no, no. I have to be very careful not to screw that. 
 Not just because she saved my life. 
 She saved my life. 
 [chuckles] 
 I'm... I'm sorry. I'm sorry. 
 I'm... rambling. Endorphins. 
 [Jefferson panting] 
 Are you waiting for Jennifer? 
 No. 
 You got your sad eyes. 
 What's going on? 
 I went to see Gambi, like you suggested, to see if he could help me find the source of that vaccine. 
 Yeah. 
 It turns out, he knows more than I thought. 
 What do you mean? 
 Jefferson, you need to talk to Gambi. 
 Ask him the questions we've never asked. 
 To find out who he is... and where he came from. 
 What did he tell you? 
 Just... go talk to Gambi. 
 [sobbing quietly] 
 [sighing] 
 I have so many questions. 
 If I was dead, then how did I die? 
 [exhales] 
 ♪♪ As the sun Beats down my neck ♪♪ 
 ♪♪ My forehead Beads up in sweat ♪♪ How did I come back? 
 Why did I come back? 
 [shushes] 
 I know, baby. I know. 
 But it's all going to be okay. 
 ♪♪ Yet and still I'm holding on to you ♪♪ 
 [sighs] 
 [sobbing] 
 [bell chiming] 
 Lynn said I needed to talk to you. 
 [sighs] 
 I was just... trying to protect you. 
 Protect me from what? 
 All these years... 
 I've kept secrets from you. 
 I had to. 
 But now the only way to protect you is to tell you the truth, tell you everything. 
 What are you talking about? 
 My real name is Peter Esposito. 
 Thirty years ago, I came to Freeland as an agent for a government organization called the ASA. 
 They were conducting an experiment in Freeland, giving the people a vaccine to make them passive and keep them docile in what was a very politically-explosive environment. 
 But their vaccine inadvertently created metahumans. 
 People with special powers. 
 And it was my job to find them. 
 But when I realized that the ASA's vaccine was killing children... 
 I leaked the information... 
 to your father... and his investigation got him killed. 
 Murdered. 
 My father... was murdered. 
 Yes, he was. 
 [voice breaks] 
 And you turned me into Black Lightning? 
 No. 
 I know it doesn't make what I've done better, but I had nothing to do with that experiment. 
 As soon as I realized that you had powers, Alvin's kid, I knew I could never let them get you. 
 And so all these years, I've tried to protect you the best I could. 
 But now... But now, what? 
 I can't anymore. 
 Martin Proctor... the head of the ASA for this area, is looking for you, and I can't stop him. 
 If you use your powers or you go out in the suit, he will find you, and they will kill you. 
 And they will find Anissa... and they will kill her, too. 
 I'm sorry, Jefferson, but you have to stop being Black Lightning. 
 Stay away from me. 
 [Jefferson breathing heavily] 
 [electricity crackling] Stay away from me. 
 Stay away from my family. 
 Must be here. 
 Ah, Jen, whatever it is, I don't have time for it. 
 Are you pregnant? 
 No. No, but something weird is definitely going on. 
 Okay. 
 What? You broke your phone? 
 No, Anissa, look at the edges. 
 I did that. 
 With my hands. 
 [sighs]
