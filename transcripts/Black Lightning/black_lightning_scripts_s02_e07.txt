 [Jefferson] Previously on Black Lightning... 
 Who hired you to kill me? 
 I don't know who hired me. 
 [grunts] Sorry, ladies. 
 Kill the Reverend. Boss, hey, let's slow down. 
 That Christian clown got away once. 
 Let's see if his God will protect him again. 
 If you don't leave Freeland tonight, you are going to die. 
 Boy, let me tell you something... [grunts] 
 [grunts] 
 You're walking down the wrong path, Khalil. 
 It's too late for me. 
 You have to save the baby. And find Anaya. 
 [Anaya] There's a lady who calls herself Looker. 
 She used the silver, which she calls "element," to turn the white folks into Sange. 
 When I came to South Freeland, all of you were weak... 
 [Jake] You made us slaves! 
 You're worse than the drugs! [screams] 
 What the hell? 
 [Anaya groaning] Push! Push for me! 
 Doing good! There you go! Yeah. 
 [Batina] What's wrong? She's having twins. 
 [chuckles] [babies crying] 
 Whoa! 
 What is Sange? 
 [Anaya] White folks with powers who basically terrorize South Freeland. They call us the Perdi. 
 [buzzing] 
 [grunts] [static crackling] 
 Where's your parents? 
 They haven't made it back yet. None of them have. 
 The baby? 
 [over comms] This silver liquid always returns to Looker. 
 [Black Lightning into comms] Okay, get Anaya and the other baby to safety. 
 There's another baby. Find it.

 [Black Lightning into comms] I don't know exactly. 
 Nowhere good, I can tell you that. 
 Well, are you okay? 
 Damn. 
 What? 
 Let's just say someone clearly drew a line in the sand. 
 [Anissa over comms] All right, maybe you should turn back. 
 No, not without the baby. 
 You are always telling me to be strategic and not stubborn. 
 Now I'm telling you. You are not safe goin' after them alone. 
 I'm running low on juice. I gotta go. 
 Dad, listen to me! 
 I'll contact you as soon as I can. Take care of yourself. 
 Take care of the baby.

 I really do like it here. 
 I'm glad to hear it. 
 [takes deep breath] You said you needed to see me. 
 Yes, I did. [sighs] 
 But you haven't said much since we got here. 
 I can't help you if you won't tell me... 
 Is this about that boy, Khalil? 
 Sort of. [sighs] 
 Then you really need to be having this conversation with your parents. 
 No, they wouldn't... [sighs] 
 Well, they don't like Khalil, okay? Or me very much right now. 
 And what makes you say that? 
 Because they treat me like some sort of prisoner, they don't even let me leave the house. [sighs] 
 I think they're trying to protect you. What do you think? 
 I think they look at me and see failure. 
 You are not a failure. 
 No, they see themselves as failures. 
 My dad thinks it's his fault I turned out weird. 
 And I know he's trying to protect me from living some awful life, but he's so busy doing that... 
 They both are, they're not letting me live at all. 
 I don't know. Being locked up in a room is definitely not a life. 
 It's like I'm being punished for... being born this way. [scoffs] 
 Well, they don't mean to punish you. They love you. 
 Yeah, I know, I just don't how much more of this kind of love I can take. 
 So I'm definitely not talking to them about, you know who. 
 'Cause they might send me to nun school if I do that. 
 [chuckles softly] Well, all I can say is that if you care for Khalil, and he cares for you, just be safe. 
 Make sure you use condoms. 
 What? No. Uh, well, yes, I know that, but that's not the kind of advice I was looking for. 
 [sighs] I just don't wanna hurt him. 
 My parents sent me to you because they were worried I wouldn't be able to control my powers. 
 So what if I'm with him and I shock him to death or something? 
 Is that what you're scared of? 
 Yes. Well, that and... 
 And? 
 And that I'm going to spend the rest of my life like this. 
 Like what? 
 Just not normal. Feeling like nobody understands me. 
 Nobody really understands what it feels like to be me, not my parents, not my sister, not... 
 Not me? 
 [sighs] Well, no, I didn't mean it like that. I just... 
 I miss the way things used to be when I felt like me. 
 And my family, I miss the way we used to be. 
 And I know that things are never gonna be the same again. 
 There's nothing I can do about it, and I hate that. 
 [man over comms] Secure government channel. Scanning encryption. 
 Scanning all pertinent keywords. 
 [man over radio] They named the baby Alex Pierce Smith. 
 [woman 1 over radio] Aw. Is Pierce a family name? 
 [man] Yeah, on my mom's side. 
 Cool, right? 
 [woman] Oh, yeah, I know Jefferson Pierce. 
 Didn't he get into trouble or somethin'? They fired him, right? 
 [woman 2] I don't know, girl. But I do know he's fine as hell. 
 [man over comms] Encryption secure. 
 [distorted] There he is... 
 Black Lightning. 
 [distorted] I've been a fan from a distance for some years now. 
 I've tried to model myself after you. 
 Always felt like you and I had a lot in common. 
 Yeah, I doubt that. 
 No, really. We both want the drugs and the crime off our streets. 
 We both make sacrifices for people that we don't even know. 
 And the thing I like about you the most is that you fight for your people. 
 I fight for mine. You're a proud African-American. 
 I'm a proud White American. 
 You're a racist. 
 Now, how did you jump to racist so quick? 
 Nice flag. 
 The joys of minority privilege. 
 It's okay for you to wear a shirt saying, "I'm black, and I'm proud," but if I wear one saying, "I'm white, and I'm proud," I'm a racist? 
 No, your T-shirt would say, "I kill and hang Perdi from trees." 
 Please. The Perdi killed one of our men for getting one of their girls pregnant. 
 Nobody is innocent in South Freeland. 
 I'm really gonna enjoy taking you down. 
 I don't think you're in a position to be threatening anyone, Black Bulb. 
 [chuckling] 
 Here's the suit. Thank you. 
 What's in the vial? 
 I'm not sure. But we'll talk about it later. 
 Hey. 
 Anaya, you can trust her. This is my mom, Lynn. 
 She's beautiful. What's her name? 
 Well, with everything going on, I really haven't had a chance to settle on one. 
 Her father and I hadn't officially decided. 
 Her belly button's still a little bloody. 
 You mind if I clean it up a little bit? 
 Hey. 
 Okay. 
 There. 
 [cooing] 
 I'd like to draw some blood, if that's okay? 
 It's okay, Anaya, she's a doctor. 
 Okay. 
 You help me for a minute? Sure. 
 [shuddering] Did you see what I just saw? 
 If you mean, did I see that vial trying to get to the baby's blood, then, yeah, I saw it. What's going on? 
 I'm not sure. 
 What, is Anaya a meta? No. 
 What about the dad? 
 Well, I know he was Sange, but not a meta. 
 Sange? 
 Mom, it's complicated. 
 But... 
 Wake up. 
 Oh... 
 Wake up. 
 I need to know where the other baby is. Hmm? 
 You have to admit, the irony is amazing, you getting electrocuted. 
 [chuckles softly] 
 [grunting] 
 Where's the baby? 
 [sighs] 
 [winces] 
 [gasping] 
 The baby... 
 I can sense her. 
 Let's go. Flip the switch again. 
 [grunting] Leave it on until he dies. 
 [grunting] 
 [comms beeping] 
 [crackling on comms] 
 [baby crying] 
 [Anissa over comms] Sorry for the noise, guys. I didn't mean to scare you. 
 I just accidentally knocked the chair over. 
 [sighs] 
 [sighs] 
 You can turn it off. He's dead. 
 [scoffs] 
 [baby crying] 
 [chuckles] 
 There she is. 
 My power doesn't come from the suit. 
 Thanks for the charge, though. 
 [all grunting] 
 [pants] 
 [Sange warrior groaning] 
 [baby fussing] 
 [baby fussing] 
 [baby continues fussing] 
 [cooing] 
 [softly] Hi. 
 [grunts] 
 Yeah, he was a bad man. 
 Let's go see Mommy, okay? [coos] 
 You scared me. 
 I used to love dusting brothers on this track. 
 You like caviar? 
 Caviar? 
 Tobias told me, you never forget the first time you can afford to eat caviar. 
 Jen, you deserve a guy that can give you that. 
 Okay, where is all of this coming from? 
 Actions have consequences. 
 What are you talking about? 
 You're really starting to scare me. [cell phone buzzes] 
 [scoffs] 
 [Jen sighs] 
 He's not gonna stop. 
 Not until I kill Reverend Holt or until he kills me. 
 But I can't. I don't want to be like him. 
 Then don't be. 
 My dad says when there's a problem, you just need to focus on finding a solution. 
 So that's what we're gonna do. We're gonna focus and figure this out together. 
 Can you buy some time? 
 [sighs] I don't know. Maybe? 
 Great. Then buy some time, go back to Reverend Holt and make him leave. 
 I already tried... Do whatever it takes. Try harder. 
 And then, you'll leave. 
 Now, where am I gonna go? Hmm? 
 It's not like I just have money around where I can just leave... 
 All right, listen. Focus on Reverend Holt, and we'll figure the rest out later. 
 [sighs] 
 Look at me. Look at me. 
 I got you. All right? 
 [sighs] 
 [baby crying] 
 [Jefferson shushes] Oh, I know. I know, little one. 
 You're probably hungry and tired. 
 [baby continues crying] [shushes] 
 Here, here. We're... 
 We're gonna get you to your mommy real soon, okay? 
 [shushes] It's okay. It's okay. 
 Hmm... 
 I'll be damned. 
 [beep] 
 Hey, it's me. 
 I was worried! Are you okay? 
 Was running low on juice, didn't want to contact you until we were closer to Freeland. 
 Whoa, "we"? 
 Yeah. I got the baby right here. 
 [sighs] Whoa, Dad, what about the grandparents? 
 [Black Lightning over comms] I don't know. They weren't with the baby. 
 Everyone safe on your end? 
 Yeah, we're good. We're, uh, we're at the old mall. 
 Looker's headed your way. - Wait, how? 
 I can't figure it out, but somehow she can sense the baby. 
 What do you mean, "sense the baby"? 
 Well, she said she could "sense" the baby and took off with her gang. 
 And there's something weird about them. 
 Their veins glow, and they act like they're in a trance or something. 
 I've never seen anything like it, so just be extra, extra careful. 
 I will. You, too. 
 Yeah. 
 Ooh. Reverend Holt. Listen, you have got to... 
 [gun cocks] 
 You need to step back, son. Okay. Okay. 
 Look, I only came back to tell you that you're in danger. 
 You've got to leave, now. 
 No. I don't feel like I'm the one in danger right now. 
 Yeah, well, you are. Tobias wants you dead. 
 Let me tell you somethin', son. See, you ain't no killer. 
 But you best believe I'll send your black ass to the Lord sure as day turns to night, you understand me? 
 No, you're not listening to me, Reverend. 
 Tobias wants you dead, not me. 
 And that's why I'm here warning you. 
 See, what the problem is, you scared of Tobias, but I ain't. 
 Do you have any idea what will happen to you if you don't leave Freeland? 
 What will happen is in God's hands, son. 
 Now let yourself out. [scoffs] 
 Come on. [clicks tongue] 
 [door opens] 
 [breathing heavily] 
 Need a ride? 
 Get your ass in the car. 
 Get your ass in the car. 
 [horn blaring] [tires screech] 
 [line ringing] 
 [panting] 
 [cell phone ringing] 
 Hello? 
 Hey. [pants] Okay, look, Reverend Holt ain't going anywhere, and Tobias just rolled up on me out of the blue. 
 Hold up. You're with Tobias? 
 No. No, I got away. 
 But he'll find me again, he always does. 
 [sighs] All right, Khalil, tell me where you are. 
 Jen, leave me alone before he finds out that you're with me. 
 Would you leave me alone? 
 [sighs] No, never. 
 All right, then don't expect me to leave you. Now, tell me where you are. 
 Guys? Guys? I need you to wait in the restroom until I tell you to come out or Black Lightning does. 
 [sighs] 
 Your little girl is lucky to have you as a mom. 
 [chuckles] No matter how old we get, we can always count on our moms to have our backs. 
 But I think it's safest for you and for her to wait in there for now. Okay? 
 Okay. All right. 
 Be careful, okay? [sighs] I will. 
 I love you. I love you, too, Mom. 
 [kisses] 
 [takes deep breath] 
 [dog barking] 
 Hey. Did I wake you? 
 Hey, you know what time it is? Hell, yeah, you woke... 
 Is that a baby? 
 
 
 
 Yeah. [stutters] I need you to watch her for me, all right? 
 I'll be back as soon as I possibly can. Jefferson? 
 Oh. I, I think she needs a change. 
 [stammers] 
 [Inspector Henderson] Veretta? 
 [member 1] Remember, Tobias wants him alive. 
 If he doesn't get to kill him himself, he'll kill one of us. 
 [beeping] 
 [member 2] Yo, what is it? What the hell, man? 
 Damn. I can't see a thing. 
 [member 2] Yo, I can't get a signal. 
 Hey, you getting a read on him? 
 Nah. It's like he disappeared. 
 Go, go, go, go, go. 
 [Lightning] Follow my voice. 
 Wait, Jen? 
 [Lightning] Yeah. I told you, I got you. Just follow my voice. 
 [takes deep breath] 
 [grunts] 
 [grunts] Jen? 
 [pants] I can't... I can't see nothing. [pants] 
 Can you see now?

 [choking] 
 [cracking] [exclaims] 
 [groans] 
 [groans] 
 See, see? That, that's what I'm talking about. Now, what's happening with them? 
 Dad, chill, chill. They'll be fine now. 
 We'll be... we'll be fine now, too. 
 You sure? 
 Yep. She was controlling them with theta waves. 
 Theta what? 
 The neocortex is the part of the brain involved in sensory perception, motor skills, and language. 
 There's all these theories about how theta waves help animals navigate their locations in the wild, and they even affect behavior when we're sleepin'. 
 Now, it's not fully understood, but someone being... 
 Please stop. 
 Dad, this is really... Listen, you gotta listen to me. 
 No, no, I will pay you to stop. 
 [sighs] 
 What are you gonna do with her? 
 [Looker whimpering] 
 [sighs] I don't know. 
 We have to give her to the ASA. 
 They're the only ones equipped to handle her. 
 Doesn't the ASA experiment on metas? 
 That's her problem. 
 [talking indistinctly] 
 It's time, get up. 
 Come on. Be ready. [groaning] 
 [guns cocking] 
 All right. We're here. 
 I don't know if I should've came back so soon. 
 I don't know what to say, I don't know what they think of me. 
 Look, you can't focus on what they think of you. 
 Sometimes it's just best to talk it out. 
 But I crossed a line I don't know if I can redeem myself from. 
 Look, I'll watch the babies, but I think they need you more than your fear's allowing you to see. 
 Okay? You got it. 
 [sighs] 
 [sobbing] No. 
 [sobbing] 
 No. No. 
 [Anaya sobbing] 
 [baby cooing] 
 [Anaya sobbing] 
 [Anissa chuckles] 
 [sighs] Joan is a wilding. 
 [on TV] Shouldn't you be writing that down? 'Cause that should be in the article. 
 [Anissa laughs] [laughter on TV] 
 [sighs] 
 Hey, you okay? 
 I'm fine. 
 Well, I know you're fine. [laughing] 
 But are you okay? 
 You are so corny. Whatever. [chuckles] 
 I gotta go to the bathroom. 
 [knock at door] 
 You look pretty good for a dead guy. 
 You gonna invite me in? 
 [Gambi sighs] 
 I believe this belongs to you. 
 It's not like you to leave a live transmitter lying around. 
 Uh... It must have jammed when it crashed. 
 [clicking] 
 I don't know whether to hug you or hit you, old man. 
 If slugging me will make you feel better, you can. 
 So? 
 Someone tried to assassinate me. I still don't know who. 
 It's better that they still think that I'm dead, safer for your family that I stay dead. 
 You gotta know by now, you are my family. 
 [sighs] [muffled grunt] 
 I'm sorry, man. 
 [sighs] These damn kids could not turn these lights off. 
 [Lynn] Hey. 
 Jen? 
 Jen? 
 Jen? 
 - Hey, this is Jen, leave a message. [beep] 
 Jen, it's Mom. It's really late. Where are you? 
 Look, where is she? 
 I can't tell you that. Can't or won't? 
 I can't violate the trust of those who confide in me or my work would be rendered useless. 
 Listen, I may not have powers like the rest of my family, but trust and believe you do not want to get on my bad side, especially when it comes to my kids. 
 So tell me where the hell is my daughter! 
 I don't know... exactly. 
 What do you mean, "exactly"? 
 Stop talking like a damn oracle and speak plain English. 
 I'm saying that I can't tell you where your daughter is 
 'cause I don't know. All I know is... [sighs] 
 What? 
 She's most likely with a boy. 
 A boy? Wait, what boy? 
 And I also know that I've worked with many with powers over the years, and I've never seen anyone like Jennifer. She's special. 
 Yeah, we, we know that. 
 Do you? Jennifer's powers are extraordinary, and I don't say that lightly. 
 She's just like her father. 
 No, Jennifer's powers are beyond anything any of us have seen. 
 Teaching her to control them has been both a joy and a challenge, because I've never worked with anyone with gifts like that. 
 Which is why I must caution you. 
 What are you saying? 
 I understand you're upset. I understand you want your daughter back. 
 But you must be very careful. 
 If you push her further away, and she retreats with her powers, with no real support system and no guidance, there'll be consequences for us all. 
 ["Loveeeee Song" playing] 
 [sighs] How're you feelin'? 
 [sighs] Tired. Tired, awful... 
 [chuckles softly] And great. 
 [chuckles softly] Tired I understand. Awful I get. But great? 
 I feel great because you saved my life. 
 Everybody gave up on me, except you. 
 That's 'cause I know the real you. 
 And now you know the real me. 
 You're the only person that understands what it's like to be... 
 Like us? 
 You know, after I got shot, my mom kept telling me I could still have a normal life. 
 She didn't understand that normal stopped for me that day. 
 Things are never gonna be normal again. 
 Just like how I went from being the Queen of Garfield one day to some sort of freak overnight. 
 Yo, you're not a freak, Jen. 
 [scoffs] Man, you're beautiful. 
 Khalil, I have light shooting out of me. 
 [Jen chuckles] That doesn't freak you out? 
 It freaks me out. Like, be honest, it's weird. 
 [chuckles] Okay. Yeah, and I have metal all up in my back, and poison in my veins. 
 What, do you think that makes me weird? 
 No. 
 Yeah. That makes you weird. [chuckles] Just a little bit. 
 Okay, so, like, your parents, they don't get it. 
 That just means that they're not like you. 
 Oh, wait, are they? 
 Are yours like you? Of course not. 
 Are you sure? I'm not going to have to worry about your mom shooting darts my way, or something. [chuckles] 
 [chuckles softly] Okay. All right, so... 
 So what exactly can you do? 
 Does it matter? 
 Uh, yeah, it matters. Look, I need to know what I'm up against next time we get into a fight because I forget your birthday or for checking out some girl. 
 Okay, look, you roll your eyes, but I need to know, what, you gonna electrocute me? 
 I might. [chuckles] 
 [chuckles] Damn! 
 [gasps] 
 [sighs] Damn! Do it again. 
 [clicks tongue] Khalil, that ain't funny. 
 Hey, yo, I'm not laughing. Yo, that kiss was fire. 
 Oh, come on, it was just a little bit funny. 
 And just think about it, I mean, our kids? Their powers would be insane. 
 Okay, homie, you need to slow your roll. [chuckles] 
 You need to calm down. [chuckles] 
 Okay. Okay. You're right. You're right. We'll go slow. 
 [sighs] 
 Hey. Being here with you right now is enough for me. 
 Are you sure you wanna leave? 
 Yeah, let's go.
