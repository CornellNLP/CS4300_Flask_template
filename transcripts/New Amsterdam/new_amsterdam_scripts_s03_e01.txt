 A plane that went down in the Pacific last year. 
 Why did it go down? 
  There was an equipment problem. 
 Faulty air speed indicator. It told the pilot... 
 What does this have to do with... 
 Dane, help me understand. 
 The indicator told the pilot they were flying faster than they actually were. 
 So when they ran into some weather, and they slowed the plane down, they actually slowed it to an unsafe speed. 
 And so the engine stalled, and it went into the sea. 
 Okay, okay. All right.

 You'd dump your fuel. 
 Yeah.
