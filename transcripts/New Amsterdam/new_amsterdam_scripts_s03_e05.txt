 ♪ 
 Okay, thank you. 
 Let's step on the scale, please. 
 ♪ 
 You've got a lot of history and biology to overcome. 
 Your ghrelin is out of whack, and you've got high leptin resistance making you feel hungrier than you actually are. 
 But then your body is terrible at signaling when you're truly full. 
 Add to that all the emotional stuff you're working through, having a healthy relationship with food will be a lifelong battle for you. 
 Well, then it's a good thing I'm halfway done, right? 
 [CHUCKLES] 
 You'll need someone to work with you on your ingrained emotional assignments to food. 
 No, no, no. 
 No, I really like going to group. 
 It's great. 
 I share in there. 
 - Everyone's really supportive... 
 - Iggy. 
 You haven't logged in once. 
 No, that's not true. 
 I've... 
 The system keeps track. 
 You have to stop lying and do the work. 
 There's someone I want you to talk to. 
 It's a recovery coach? 
 What is that, a food monitor? 
 Food chaperone? 
 That's not happening. 
 No, absolutely not. 
 No.

 Can I put my pants on now, please?

 Kao, what's up? 
 - You caught me. 
 - I just wanted to check - and see, not to rush you. 
 - Mm-hmm, okay. 
 - But I was just curious. 
 - Yeah. 
 - How are the interviews going? 
 - Interviews. 
 For the interim chair of neurology. 
 Yes, those interviews are going great. 
 Really good. 
 You haven't started them yet, have you? 
 Not in the technical sense, no, but Agnes, you are the best interim, interim chair of neurology a medical director could ask for. 
 I appreciate your confidence in me, but Dr. Kapoor is a   -year veteran in the field, and I'm not even an attending. 
 I am woefully underprepared. 
 You're not, Dr. Kao,    but if it makes you feel better, I will start those interviews today. 
 Ah, Max, we've got a problem. 
 Tomorrow, but what's one more day? 
 - How can I help? 
 - Sorry, Agnes. 
 - No, Max... 
 - This way, yep. 
 Our blood bank supplies have reached critical lows. 
 How did that happen? 
 I've narrowed it down to vampires or the global pandemic. 
 There's a nicer way to say that. 
 A third of our blood donations normally come from high school or business blood drives, but with everyone at home... 
 Well, what about hospital employees? 
 Tapped out. 
 Everyone's within their eight-week turnaround window. 
 But we've got backup supplies, right? 
 Um... 
 most of it went toward Haven yesterday. 
 There was a ten-car pileup on the BQE. 
 The world's opening up faster    than we can replenish our stores. 
 We're one major accident away from catastrophe. 
 Okay, okay. 
 Don't worry. 
 You manage what little we've got left, and I will get the blood flowing. 
 I love your enthusiasm, but blood drives aren't as easy... 
 I got this. 
 Oh. 
 Sandra Fall from billing? 
 Max Goodwin, the dark overlord. 
 - Ouch, when did that happen? 
 - When I got downsized. 
 - Oh, sorry. 
 - There have been too many cuts. 
 Well, how am I supposed to cover my rent or pay my bills? 
 I'm gonna have to fight my cat for food. 
 Wait, no, you won't because I just had a great idea. 
 You can be my new executive assistant. 
 You are rehired. 
 Where are you going? 
 To find a nice street corner where I can beg for change and recyclables. 
  Come on. 
 It's not that bad of a gig. 
  Oh, no? 
 What happened to Dora? 
  - Dora quit. 
 - Oh, what happened to Adele? 
  - Adele died... 
 - What? 
  Of natural causes. 
  It had nothing to do with this job. 
 Listen, I really need your help putting together a hospital blood drive. 
  It is an emergency situation. 
  It's got to be fast, impactful, efficient, and when I think efficient, I think of Sandra... 
 ow. 
  - Okay, just for the day? 
 - I gotta go. 
  Please, just for the good of humanity? 
  How about for your cat's nutritional autonomy? 
  - Fine.

  - I'll do it for Lilith. 
 Okay? 
 - Yes, fantastic. 
  - Thank you...

  No, no, no.

  New Amsterdam is officially out of blood. 
   [TENSE MUSIC] 
  We need blood fast. 
  We gotta target non-sick people coming into the hospital, most of whom are parents who often have their kids with them, and what is the one thing that parents need right now more than anything? 
  Time away from their kids. 
  So the puppies will babysit the kids, and we will give the parents a quiet moment to come in and give us their life-saving blood. 
  Why not just get human babysitters? 
  Because the puppies were already on rotation in the pediatric ward. 
  - Max. 
 - Yes? 
  Please tell me you're done retooling whatever it was that you were retooling. 
  - Yeah. 
 - Hi, Sandra. 
  Got a lot done, too. 
  You were busy doing... 
 other stuff. 
  By other stuff, I assume you mean finding out that the one major accident we were away from catastrophe just came in? 
  That is not what I meant, but I told you I got this. 
  So we probably have people in every seat lined up around the block.

  Chance, in our one-on-one's, expressed a little reluctance at joining this group, but I assured him that there's no safer place than here with his sisters and brothers, and he's coming up on a really tough anniversary.

  It can trigger vasospasm in the retinal artery, which is probably what's causing your blindness. 
  Probably?

  Max, no one wants fine dining in the vicinity of nurses with urine samples, sick or dying people, and sirens blaring in the background. 
  I know, but I think I've got something that's gonna drown out those sirens, that's gonna lift people's spirits, and for the love of God, it's gonna inspire them to donate blood.

  All these people here are donating their time, their talents, their food, their dogs to get people like you to donate their blood, which is desperately needed. 
  I see you stopped in, but not quite biting. 
  So I was just wondering, what's it gonna take? 
  Do you have any idea what people are going through right now? 
  I'm homeschooling three kids while taking care of my ailing father. 
  I... 
  I've donated to every cause under the sun. 
  I've marched for social justice. 
  I've made meals for the unhoused. 
  We're done. 
 Everyone is tapped. 
  I know, but... but... 
  People have given everything this past year, except their blood. 
  And I, for one, would like to keep that. 
  - So that's it? 
 - People are just done giving?

  Anita, your biopsy revealed something unusual. 
  The technical term for it is, you're a chimera. 
  You have two different DNAs in your body. 
  How is that possible? 
  It's a rare condition that can happen in utero in twin pregnancies. 
  But I'm not a twin. 
  You were. 
  When you were just an embryo, you had a fraternal twin who didn't come to term. 
  A sister. 
  In the womb, you absorbed her, including her ovaries, and that's the second DNA. 
  Which is why the blood test said you weren't Elisa's mother. 
  Elisa was born from your body but from your sister's egg. 
  So I'm... 
  I'm not her daughter? 
  Elisa, you may look different, but what this proves is you're actually more than your mother's daughter. 
  Not less. 
  I'm sorry you felt different. 
  I should've made you feel special. 
  I guess we both kind of are.
