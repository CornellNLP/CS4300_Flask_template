 [TENDER MUSIC] 
  Yeah? 
  Can we get a laugh? 
  Come on, Luna. 
  [GOOFY EXCLAMATIONS] 
  How about a giggle? 
  No? 
  Nothing? 
  [SIGHS] 
  Maybe try your dance moves. 
  You wanna see some moves? 
  Okay. 
  [JAMES BROWN'S "GET UP OFFA THAT THING"] 
  - Okay, yeah. 
  - Oh, whoo! 
  - Say it now! 
  - [LAUGHS] 
  Get up off of that thing And dance until you feel better - Oh, yeah. 
  - Get up off of that thing And dance until you, sing it now! 
  ALL: Get up off of that thing Spin move. 
  [EXCLAIMS] 
  Nothing. 
  - Yeah? 
  Is this - [CRIES] 
  Okay, okay, okay. 
  I'm sorry. 
  That was bad. 
  I know. 
  I deserve that. 
  I deserve that. 
  You know she'll laugh when she's ready. 
  Aww, baby. 
  [GOOFY EXCLAMATION] 
  You know, Mommy used to dance yeah, not better than Daddy. 
  She used to float on the air like this. 
  [WHOOSHES] 
  She was luminous. 
  Stop. 
  You were. 
  [WHISPERS] 
  She was. 
  - And this is for you. 
  - [UPBEAT MUSIC] 
  - Thanks. 
  - No. 
  I'm not just giving you a dollar. 
  This is also to ensure doctor-patient confidentiality. 
  Okay, but you know my rates are considerably higher than that, right? 
  Remember I told you that I am going to be a grandfather? 
  Mm-hmm. 
  I was not supposed to tell you that. 
  Why, because it's the first trimester? 
  No, because Ella may not keep it. 
  Uh, what what? 
  Okay. 
  How do you feel about that? 
  [STAMMERS] 
  Like - Helpless? 
  - Yes. 
  - Yeah. 
  - And I don't like it. 
  - I'm going to talk to her. 
  - What? 
  No. 
  No, no, no, no, you can't you can't talk to her. 
  Ella's about to make a profoundly personal decision, one that is only hers to make. 
  - Yeah, but - Ah-ah, no "buts. 
  " No meddling, no prying. 
  You can't even ask. 
  So, what can I do? 
  Whatever you need to do to not talk to her about it, you should do that. 
  [INDISTINCT PA ANNOUNCEMENTS] 
  There you are. 
  Sorry I didn't call you back. 
  It's been a crazy morning. 
  Seems like all your mornings are crazy. 
  [CHUCKLES] 
  How Memorial thought that they can restructure their entire legal department in just two months is Hey, well, in two days, you get to walk away from it and I get to have you back home in my arms while we plan our wedding together. 
  Can't wait. 
  Well, sounds like you can. 
  No. 
  I'm sorry. 
  I just really want to leave the team in good shape, and we're pretty far from that. 
  [SIGHS] 
  You've got this. 
  [SOFT DRAMATIC MUSIC] 
  - Babe, I I gotta go. 
  - [KEYPAD BEEPS] 
  Love you. 
  [KEYPAD BEEPS] 
  Don't look so worried, Paz. 
  You're just here for your routine scan to check on the progress of your tumor. 
  Did your sister tell you how promising her last PET scan was? 
  That's not why she's upset. 
  - Sorry, but you should tell her. 
  - Paz? 
  As you know when uterine cancer threw a wrench into my IVF plan, I mean, Jasmine stepped up to be my surrogate. 
  And she did months of testing and hormone injections I was going to be implanted next week. 
  But our insurance company suddenly changed the rule. 
  Now they won't cover surrogacy of any kind. 
  That's insane. 
  When did they change the rules? 
  Three weeks ago, Max. 
  They basically stopped covering surrogacy overnight. 
  Even though both sisters are with the same company. 
  Barcroft, who will cover Jasmine if she wants to have a baby and Paz if she could have a baby, but they won't cover Jasmine if she wants to have Paz's baby. 
  I mean, it's not as if Paz's embryo inside Jasmine's womb is gonna cost them any more money. 
  Right, but having no baby saves them a lot of money. 
  Adoption agencies aren't exactly queuing up to give kids to women with cancer, so what now? 
  I mean, Paz waits three years to see if her uterus is still "hospitable" after all the radiation? 
  That's her only shot of becoming a mother? 
  Helen, if Barcroft changed the rule overnight, then let's get them to change it right back. 
  [SIGHS] 
  Dr. 
  Ligon isn't back yet? 
  Not only is he still on vacation, he is also the kind of person who turns his phone off while on vacation. 
  - Who does that to an addict? 
  - Use someone else already. 
  I heard great things about Dr. 
  Parsons. 
  [DOOR SLAMS OPEN] 
  Seven-year-old accidental choking victim. 
  Got caught in window blinds. 
  Heart rate 118. 
  BP 110 over 78. 
  18 respirations per minute. 
  Setting 98% on nasal cannula. 
  Okay, let's get him to trauma one. 
  We're gonna take good care of you, okay? 
  - That's our son. 
  - Yeah, you can see him once the doctors get him stabilized, okay? 
  But let me show you where the waiting room It's gonna be okay. 
  Hey, hey, come with me. 
  [DRAMATIC MUSIC] 
  Sweetie, come on. 
  [INDISTINCT ANNOUNCEMENT OVER PA] 
  Look straight ahead. 
  That's it, Calvin. 
  Good job. 
  [VELCRO RIPS] 
  [SINISTER MUSIC] 
  Can you tell me what kind of blinds you got caught in? 
  I don't know. 
  [PENSIVE MUSIC] 
  [SOFTLY] 
  Let's get Iggy and Child Services down here now. 
  - What do you think? 
  - Let's just hope I'm wrong. 
  I was, uh, cooking breakfast. 
  Calvin was in his room playing, and it was quiet. 
  It's never quiet, so I went to check in on him and I saw a cord, uh, wrapped around his little neck. 
  And I tried to rip it off, but it was all knotted up, so I started screaming for Alana. 
  I turned the house upside down trying to find scissors. 
  By the time I got them, Calvin was turning blue. 
  He was thrashing, so Ethan had to hold him still. 
  [SIGHS] 
  You know, I I was scared I was gonna cut him. 
  But I got them off and we called 911. 
  [SOFT DRAMATIC MUSIC] 
  Now, if the police were to come to your home - The police? 
  - Yeah, the police. 
  If they were to come to your home, they would see a piece of cord lying on the floor where your wife cut it, right? 
  You know, I think I threw it away. 
  You threw it away? 
  Yes, after we got him loose. 
  But the rest of the cord would still be dangling there, severed. 
  That's what the police would see. 
  And and they would also see the scissors lying on the floor. 
  And the drawers that Alana looked through, they would all be open. 
  And the breakfast that you were cooking would still be on the stove. 
  Th-there were no scissors. 
  Um, there was no cord. 
  It was, uh Just me. 
  But I swear, it'll never happen again. 
  Please don't please don't take him away. 
  So what are you saying, that I'm lying? 
  The marks on Calvin's neck aren't abrasions. 
  They're bruises. 
  A cord didn't do it. 
  Hands did. 
  It was me. 
  He was having a tantrum. 
  I just snapped. 
  I didn't know I was choking him. 
  I just wanted him to stop. 
  Ethan, I don't think that your son was choked by a man. 
  The wounds on his neck were far too small. 
  May I see your hands? 
  [SIGHS] 
  A person who chokes someone often has defensive wounds on their hands from the fingernails of the person they're choking. 
  You don't. 
  What happened to your brother, Juliet? 
  I wanted his phone, so I took it. 
  Thank you for choosing Barcroft insurance. 
  This is Jonathan, how can I be of service to you today? 
  Uh, Jonathan, hi. 
  This is, uh, Dr. 
  Max Goodwin, uh, calling about a recent policy change. 
  No, no, I don't need billing. 
  Operator. 
  I'm sorry. 
  I didn't catch that. 
  Operator! 
  This is regarding account number 42118? 
  No, it's regarding Paz Aquino. 
  She's not a number. 
  She's a person. 
  I know this is the wrong department, Frank, but it seems to be the only department populated by people. 
  Our call center's in Bangalore. 
  Bangalore, wow. 
  Uh, is there any way you could connect me to someone a little closer to this side of the Earth? 
  - Good afternoon. 
  - Mm, is it? 
  I have a question for you: you don't happen to be located anywhere in the Western Hemisphere, do you? 
  - I'm in Kuala Lumpur. 
  - Kuala Lumpur. 
  Um, forgive my ignorance. 
  Is that closer to New York City than Bangalore? 
  Please hold. 
  Let me check on that. 
  - Happy to. 
  - [PHONE CLATTERS] 
  How do you think Calvin felt when you hurt him? 
  [PENCIL SCRATCHES] 
  [SWIPING PAPER] 
  Well, you know, if I had to take a guess which I don't, but I'm going to I would say that he was probably afraid. 
  I don't know. 
  Hey, I am going to say a sentence, and then you tell me if it describes you. 
  Can we do that? 
  Okay, cool. 
  "I think that most other people are stupid. 
  " I don't think that. 
  All right, what about this one. 
  "I manipulate people to get what I want. 
  " No. 
  Juliet, come on. 
  It's okay. 
  It's just me and you in here. 
  Right? 
  I've seen tons of kids come through here. 
  It's obvious to me that you are, like, mega smart. 
  I'll bet you're the best at manipulating people. 
  I'm really good at it. 
  Why? 
  Why do you think you're so good at it? 
  It's it's kind of like when I draw. 
  You mean manipulating people makes you feel in control? 
  No. 
  I mean, it's just really easy. 
  - Mackenzie Adams? 
  - Yeah, hi. 
  - Hi. 
  - This is my husband, John. 
  BOTH: Hi. 
  I'm Dr. 
  Reynolds, cardiothoracic surgery. 
  Cardio? 
  Uh, we came here because my wife, uh, lost control of her bladder. 
  I'm sure it's just a UTI. 
  Well, no. 
  The urologist said that all of your tests came back negative, so cardio's the next step in the workup. 
  Well, my heart is fine. 
  Well, heart issues can affect bladder control, so we'll just do an EKG to measure your heart's activity. 
  We're not even from New York. 
  We're just visiting. 
  It's a simple test, Mrs. 
  Adams. 
  Colonel Adams. 
  - She's an astronaut. 
  - Oh. 
  I'm scheduled to fly out on Expedition 64 to the International Space Station in 58 weeks. 
  I've been working toward this my entire life. 
  This is my first space mission, so nothing can be wrong with my heart. 
  [GRUNTS] 
  - [SIGHS] 
  - [PHONE CLICKS] 
  Uh, what are you doing? 
  Mm. 
  Earth to Vijay. 
  I am meditating. 
  Okay. 
  Why? 
  To control the chaos in my mind. 
  Because I cannot talk to someone I desperately want to talk to. 
  Well, that sounds completely pointless, but you know what? 
  I am desperate, so I'm gonna give it a go. 
  Come on, help me up here. 
  [SIREN WAILS] 
  [GROANS SOFTLY] 
  Okay, now fold your legs. 
  Sorry. 
  Close your eyes and breathe. 
  [LIGHTHEARTED MUSIC] 
  [EXHALES SLOWLY] 
  [INHALES DEEPLY] 
  I'm sorry, do you have to breathe so loud? 
  Mm! 
  [BOTH EXHALE SLOWLY] 
  Hello, this is Aneel. 
  Aneel Jay who works in the East 34th offices of Barcroft Insurance? 
  Uh, yes. 
  Who works in the appeals department on the seventh floor? 
  Can I help you with something? 
  Yeah, uh, could you remind me of your office number? 
  728. 
  What is this regarding? 
  Hold on. 
  Yeah? 
  Hey, it's regarding the extremely impersonal practice of trying to help someone over the phone. 
  I just think nothing really gets done until you sit down with someone face to face. 
  You know what I mean? 
  - I was just leaving for lunch. 
  - Were you? 
  I know a great place. 
  The honey yogurt's really good if you want to try it. 
  Look, it was an abrupt change, I know, but last year, Barcroft hemorrhaged an unprecedented $80 million in surrogacy coverage. 
  Sure, but how many babies did you help bring into the world? 
  We don't track that kind of data. 
  Mm. 
  - That's why I brought you here. 
  - [INDISTINCT PA ANNOUNCEMENTS] 
  Your company gives you data. 
  You get case numbers instead of stories. 
  You get account numbers instead of people. 
  What is this? 
  This is account number 42118. 
  Her name is Paz Aquino. 
  Excuse me. 
  [SOFT DRAMATIC MUSIC] 
  Hey, Aneel? 
  And people say insurance companies are cruel? 
  - I'm just trying to show you - Human suffering? 
  Thanks, but I hear heartbreaking stories every day. 
  Along with the carpal tunnel and the crappy paycheck, it comes with the job. 
  Then why don't you help me do something about it? 
  I may have a title that sounds effectual, but I have absolutely no power. 
  I can't help you do anything. 
  [SIGHS DEEPLY] 
  "I think that tears are a sign of weakness. 
  " Agree. 
  "I think that other people's feelings are not important. 
  " Agree. 
  "I think about hurting my family. 
  " Agree. 
  Just your brother? 
  Who else? 
  My mom and dad. 
  Why do you want to hurt them? 
  Because I can. 
  [DOOR OPENS] 
  [PHONE BLIPS] 
  You know, I mean, it's early, and one session is a small sample, but, uh, Juliet does present as callous-unemotional. 
  [SOFT SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC] 
  You're saying she's a psychopath. 
  She's been to dozens of doctors. 
  We've heard schizophrenia, ADHD, RAD. 
  No one's ever said "psychopath. 
  " Callous-unemotional. 
  It's, um it's not a diagnosis that doctors really like to give because, historically speaking, there is no cure. 
  - Then what do we do? 
  - Well She'll go into an inpatient facility run by the corrections department. 
  Jail? 
  She's 11. 
  Hold on, hold on, hold on. 
  There is one other possibility. 
  Um, punishment bounces off of callous-unemotional kids because they can't feel shame, but there has been some very promising behavioral therapy based on a reward system. 
  I'm sure you've noticed Juliet's reward drive is extremely high. 
  That's why she takes whatever she wants. 
  So if I can demonstrate some progress with Juliet, we can admit her here. 
  She could be an inpatient at New Amsterdam. 
  [SOFT DRAMATIC MUSIC] 
  - Dr. 
  Frome? 
  - Yeah. 
  Have you ever had success with a child like Juliet? 
  No. 
  [TRANQUIL MUSIC] 
  You okay? 
  s*x. 
  I just replaced pills with s*x. 
  I would say that I make the worst decisions, but you know what? 
  I'm not even sure that I make decisions. 
  I just do things. 
  Why is that bad? 
  If all of your instincts tell you to do something, why shouldn't you do that? 
  [SIGHS] 
  My instincts told me to bang my physical therapist, and it is not going well. 
  I thought I was distracting myself from the pain, but you know, actually, I think I was distracting myself from being sober. 
  [SCOFFS] 
  You know what? 
  Enough is enough. 
  God, it is time to face reality to stop avoiding and start making decisions that are actually good for me, like go to an NA meeting. 
  You just got all of that from meditating? 
  Yeah. 
  That is how it works, right? 
  [SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC] 
  - [KNOCKING ON DOOR] 
  - Yeah? 
  No. 
  Not here to harass you. 
  I'm just here to apologize. 
  - You are? 
  - Yes. 
  And to find out what office your boss is in. 
  - You can't be serious. 
  - [CHUCKLES] 
  Face to face. 
  It's gotta be worth something. 
  - Tenth floor, 1021. 
  - 1021? 
  - Mm-hmm. 
  - Thank you. 
  So at New Amsterdam, we run into arcane policy inconsistencies all the time. 
  For example, Frances may I call you Frances? 
  - I'd rather you didn't. 
  - Okay, sure. 
  For example, there is a very expensive spinal surgery that is covered by your base policy, yet there is another procedure that is less expensive and less invasive that is not. 
  And that means that Barcroft is, in turn, shelling out more money than it has to. 
  - My patient, Paz Aquino - Account number? 
  It's 42118. 
  [MELLOW MUSIC] 
  [COMPUTER BLIPS] 
  Her claim was denied because Barcroft no longer covers surrogacy. 
  So I've heard, but Barcroft will cover a uterus transplant for her, which is a procedure that will cost ten times more. 
  So, uh, I guess what I'm saying is, if Barcroft doesn't want to reverse its policy on surrogacy, then I am gonna have to advise all of my patients to consider uterine transplants instead. 
  And how do you think that's gonna affect your bottom line? 
  That's a good point. 
  Maybe we should stop covering uterine transplants starting now. 
  [CLICKS TONGUE] 
  Hm. 
  - No, it is not covered - Hi, so sorry. 
  Can you tell me who her boss is? 
  You have a condition called supraventricular tachycardia. 
  It's an atypically fast heartbeat that develops when the heart's normal electrical impulses are disrupted, and the frequency of the palpitations forced your kidneys into overdrive, which overwhelmed your bladder. 
  How do we fix it? 
  Well, I can do a catheter ablation. 
  It'll destroy the source of the problem. 
  It's non-surgical. 
  You won't even have to be put under. 
  NASA has run hundreds of tests on me. 
  How did they miss this? 
  It might be the first time it happened. 
  Will it happen again? 
  It's hard to tell. 
  It might. 
  It won't. 
  We came here last-minute for family. 
  I just need to get back to Houston, back to training. 
  Mack. 
  NASA said I'm fine, so I'm fine. 
  [BUCKLE JINGLES] 
  Um, Mackenzie, the attack you had today probably lasted a few seconds, but a serious one could last a few minutes, maybe even hours. 
  And instead of losing control of your bladder, you could lose consciousness. 
  If that happens while you're in space, your whole mission could be compromised. 
  You could risk the lives of your crew. 
  I would never do that. 
  Then don't walk out of here. 
  [SOFT DRAMATIC MUSIC] 
  If I do this procedure, will I still be cleared to fly? 
  If it's successful, this will take care of the problem permanently. 
  After a period of observation, I don't see a reason why you'd be grounded. 
  You got this. 
  Paz, I have your scan results from this morning. 
  Your tumor has stopped responding to the chemo. 
  [SOMBER MUSIC] 
  To prevent it from spreading, you'll need to have a full hysterectomy. 
  Once we remove the cancer from your body, you will enter remission faster and you will survive. 
  But Then there there's no way I'm never gonna have a baby. 
  Hey, look at me. 
  We will find a way. 
  Sorry. 
  [BREATHING SHAKILY] 
  I know that there are more important things than but I always dreamed of having a child. 
  Yeah, I know that sounds old-fashioned and No, no, no. 
  No, it doesn't. 
  It sounds human. 
  Okay, let's play a game. 
  I will set a task, and if you complete it, you win. 
  What do I win? 
  I am gonna give you Iggy Bucks. 
  - Those look lame. 
  - Well, I'm not done. 
  Iggy Bucks are how you get to the real prize. 
  50 of these earns one hour with this bad boy. 
  All right? 
  It just so happens that this first task can earn you all 50 Iggy Bucks in one go. 
  What's the task? 
  You apologize to your brother. 
  No. 
  Why not? 
  He deserved it. 
  Juliet, I know that you don't feel sorry, and I know that you may never feel sorry, but hurting Calvin was a big deal. 
  And a big deal means a big apology, but it also means a big reward. 
  You in? 
  If a big apology means a big reward what about a small apology? 
  Yeah, sure, okay. 
  We'll start small. 
  One small apology, 10 Iggy Bucks. 
  What's that? 
  Oh, um, that's something that one of my kids made me. 
  It's ugly. 
  Is your kid stupid? 
  I'm I'm sorry. 
  I didn't mean it. 
  Small apology. 
  10 bucks. 
  Oh, okay. 
  Um, that is not wow. 
  - I I didn't, um - Okay, golly gee. 
  Wow, hoop-Dee-doo. 
  [TENSE MUSIC] 
 
 
 
  Is that supposed to be me? 
  I'm so sorry. 
  20 bucks. 
  All right, I didn't say that I was playing. 
  You never said you weren't, Fat Face. 
  Were you fat as a kid? 
  Did other kids make fun of you because you were fat? 
  I'm so sorry. 
  30 bucks. 
  Okay, Juliet, why don't we go over the rules of the game You sweat. 
  You're sweaty. 
  You have sweat stains under your arms. 
  That's gross. 
  I'm sorry. 
  40 bucks. 
  Okay, I'm not playing. 
  - I - [SPITS] 
  Dr. 
  Frome, I'm really sorry. 
  50 bucks. 
  I win. 
  Okay, take it easy, man. 
  I'm just trying to help out. 
  - Aneel? 
  Aneel? 
  - Come on. 
  Hey, this is my friend Aneel. 
  He's gonna explain everything. 
  Could you explain to them that we're just trying - Come on. 
  - To help people? 
  That we're trying to do the right thing? 
  Aneel? 
  Ella? 
  I have been trying to fight my instinct the whole day and I have finally decided to come to you. 
  For a cup of coffee. 
  Coffee. 
  I do not want to discuss your personal matters, but I I do want Yes, I do want cream and sugar. 
  [STAMMERS] 
  Okay. 
  I do not want to pry, meddle, or counsel you in any way. 
  So from now on, for my cup of coffee, I will go to the other coffee shop so no unintentional or misconstrued advice slips out. 
  But for now I do want a croissant. 
  [UPBEAT MUSIC] 
  No. 
  Chocolate one, please. 
  Dr. Bloom. 
  Dr. Ligon is back tomorrow and can see you at the usual time. 
  No, actually, I would like to book an appointment with Dr. 
  Parsons for tomorrow morning. 
  Mm, Dr. Parsons' all booked up tomorrow morning, but Dr. 
  Ligon is free. 
  What about tomorrow afternoon? 
  Dr. 
  Ligon has an opening at noon. 
  Parsons. 
  I'll squeeze you right in. 
  Thank you. 
  I see the aberrant pathway. 
  Hmm. 
  Well, there's a second pathway. 
  What does that mean? 
  All right, if do more than one ablation, it could weaken your heart and increase the chance of recurrence. 
  [SIGHS] 
  I'm sorry, Mackenzie. 
  You need surgery. 
  That will ground me. 
  Well, so will a fragile heart. 
  [SIGHS] 
  When I was little, I used to sneak out of the house when everyone was asleep. 
  I would lie in the yard and feel the dark all around me, and I would look up at the stars and I knew that someday, I would be up there with them. 
  [VOICE BREAKING] 
  I really thought I would get there. 
  [INHALES SHARPLY, SIGHS] 
  [SIGHS] 
  All right, I don't like it, but I can do two ablations. 
  It will destroy all the damage, but after the procedure, you have to let me put your heart through a stress test. 
  Is that dangerous? 
  Well, if the ablations are insufficient, it could push Mackenzie into cardiac arrest. 
  - You could die. 
  - I won't. 
  I won't. 
  So, Mackenzie's resting. 
  We'll do the stress test in the morning. 
  [SIGHS] 
  Thank you. 
  [SIREN WAILS FAINTLY] 
  Can I ask you something? 
  How can I be married to someone who loves space more than she loves me? 
  Well, I wasn't gonna put it like that. 
  I love Mackenzie the way she loves the stars. 
  She loves me more than anything on Earth. 
  Can't ask for more than that. 
  Could ask her to stay. 
  Uh, you think John Glenn's wife ever asked him to stay? 
  I wouldn't blame her if she had. 
  [CHUCKLES] 
  You know what the KÃ¡rmÃ¡n line is? 
  It's the boundary where Earth ends and space begins. 
  Loving Mack means helping her cross that line, even if she's leaving me on the other side of it. 
  [DOOR OPENS] 
  I really thought that face to face How could they say no? 
  But it's so unfair. 
  Yeah. 
  I mean, even without the financial issues, IVF is it's so fraught. 
  It's just so filled with hope and with despair, and and blame. 
  [SOFT DRAMATIC MUSIC] 
  Helen? 
  - Did you - [SIGHS] 
  After the accident, everything just seemed so fragile. 
  I don't really know what I was waiting for. 
  It's what I've always wanted, so I just went and I made it happen. 
  And the minute that I did it, I knew that I'd made a mistake. 
  Because I want to be a mum, but I realized that I don't want to do it alone. 
  And luckily, it didn't take. 
  We can't let Paz lose. 
  Juliet, grab a seat. 
  So, you were really very good at my game. 
  Your game was easy. 
  Yeah, you kicked my butt good. 
  But I'm not so sure if you're ready for the harder version. 
  Expert level. 
  - I'm great at games. 
  - You are. 
  Yeah, you're great at games because you like winning, but also because you like making other people lose. 
  You made me lose emotionally. 
  You made Calvin lose physically. 
  Whenever you win, someone else has to lose. 
  That's how winning works. 
  Yes, but not in expert level. 
  In expert level, you have to win without the other person ever knowing that they lost. 
  You make somebody angry, you upset them, that's it. 
  Game over. 
  You lose. 
  What do I get if I win? 
  [INQUISITIVE MUSIC] 
  Calvin's phone. 
  So when do we start? 
  Right now. 
  All right, Mackenzie, I'm going to inject your IV with enough adrenaline to simulate the stress of launch and reentry, all right? 
  Now, it's going to be extremely intense, all right? 
  It's gonna feel like your heart's pounding right out of your chest, but the first sign of trouble, I'm gonna stop the test and intervene. 
  [SOFTLY] 
  Okay. 
  [SOFT SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC] 
  Now, the target is 195 beats per minute. 
  If you can achieve that without any cardiac event, you should be clear to fly. 
  [MONITOR BEEPING] 
  [SIGHS SOFTLY] 
  Ready when you are. 
  [BEEPING GROWING FASTER] 
  [GASPING] 
  [DISTORTED VOICE] 
  Faster. 
  [DISTORTED VOICE] 
  Breathe. 
  [MONITORS BEEPING RAPIDLY] 
  [HEART POUNDING RAPIDLY] 
  [SUSTAINED HIGH-PITCHED TONE] 
  [TONE FADES] 
  [WONDROUS MUSIC] 
  [BREATHING SLOWLY] 
  [MUFFLED] 
  Mackenzie? 
  Mackenzie? 
  [EXHALES] 
  Come on back. 
  [MONITOR BEEPING STEADILY] 
  [GENTLE MUSIC] 
  Congratulations. 
  You passed. 
  - [GASPS] 
  - You did it. 
  [LAUGHS] 
  You did it. 
  We did it? 
  [EXHALES SHARPLY] 
  [SOBS] 
  [LAUGHS] 
  Oh [SIGHS] 
  Hey, sweetie. 
  Hey, Dad. 
  [EXHALES SLOWLY] 
  Hey, Cal. 
  Hey. 
  [SCREEN CLACKING] 
  I'm sorry I hurt you for a stupid phone. 
  I really didn't mean to and I'm really sorry. 
  Okay. 
  Can I can I play with your phone? 
  I'm not done. 
  But I apologized. 
  [TENSE MUSIC] 
  Here. 
  Trade. 
  - No. 
  - I want it. 
  - I apologized. 
  - Juliet - I think we're done here. 
  - I want it! 
  I want it! 
  I want it! 
  I want it! 
  Shh. 
  [BREATHING HEAVILY] 
  [SOFT DRAMATIC MUSIC] 
  I don't know why I get so angry, and I wish I did, because everyone thinks I don't care about anyone, but I do! 
  I care about you. 
  And I want your phone because when we play the same games, that's the only way I know how to be close to you. 
  I thought you hated me. 
  I hate that I'm different from you. 
  Thank you. 
  [MOUTHING] 
  [FOREBODING MUSIC] 
  You call that progress? 
  That was terrifying. 
  - She manipulated them. 
  - Okay, yeah. 
  I mean, I'll give you that it wasn't exactly a Hallmark moment, but come on. 
  We all operate on a reward system of some kind. 
  You know, you do good in school, you get good grades, your parents buy you a car. 
  You hold down a job and you get money. 
  We'll spend the next few years shifting Juliet's prizes from phones to real-world things and then who knows? 
  If she can learn to always play on expert level, maybe she'll win the big prize a normal life. 
  But there will always be something missing with her. 
  Yes, empathy. 
  She'll never have it, so we have to have it for her. 
  Thank you for choosing Marcos Insurance. 
  This is Melissa. 
  How can I be of service to you today? 
  Hi, Melissa, I'm just calling to see if your company provides coverage for surrogacy. 
  Well, I'm sorry, sir. 
  Unfortunately, Marcos Insurance does not cover surrogacy of any [PHONE CLUNKS] 
  I wanted to be a doctor. 
  You did? 
  I did a year of med school, but I couldn't cut it, and I've spent the last ten years kind of numb because instead of helping people, I ended up doing the exact opposite. 
  Until today. 
  Trustee exemption? 
  Anyone on the board of trustees can override a policy claim without changing the policy itself. 
  Then you found a trustee and got them to make an exception for 42118? 
  No. 
  I got them to make an exception for Paz Aquino. 
  She and her sister can proceed with IVF. 
  - Aneel? 
  - No. 
  - Yeah. 
  - Okay. 
  [LAUGHS] 
  How did you pull this off? 
  I talked to someone at the top, face to face. 
  [MELLOW MUSIC] 
  Yes. 
  - Thank you. 
  - [LAUGHS] 
  [BOTH LAUGHING] 
  [GENTLE ACOUSTIC MUSIC] 
  I was never ready To face myself Gamble Everything's in shambles It took me two full years To make it right Hoo - How's it going? 
  - Good, good. 
  There's still a ton to do, so I doubt I'll get to sleep before landing in New York, but But you love it, right? 
  I do love it. 
  Hey, how much time would you need to finish out there? 
  Six weeks. 
  But I don't expect you to Then I'll see you in six weeks. 
  The same mistake Um, I don't know what that was earlier Twisted through a gas light But if I want to talk to someone in the future, I would like to talk to you.

  - Think things come out, uh I know. 
  We have a, uh, picture of Georgia that we talk to sometimes. 
  You don't have to explain.

  Okay.
