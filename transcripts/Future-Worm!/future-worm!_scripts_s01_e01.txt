 Narrator : This is Danny. His life changed forever when visited by a time-traveling worm. 
 Are you from the future? 
 [SPITS] You know it. 
 Male narrator : One boy, one worm! These are their adventures. 
 1x01 - "No Anchovies" 
 Future-worm : Welcome to Three Second Abs. 
 You ready? 
 You know it. 
 Begin! 
 [BOTH GRUNTING] I'm so hungry, man. I'm ordering a pizza. Excellent, but no anchovies. I hate anchovies! Hey, Danny, the usual? Yeah, but no anchovies. It'll be there in 20 minutes. Piece out. What? Twenty minutes? I'm starving, I can't wait that long! Come on, we're going 20 minutes to the future for our pizza! Future-worm : Come on, let's go. [SCREAMING] [BOTH GRUNTING] Uh, I think we took a wrong turn. Man, this place rules! And look, our pizza! Whoo, let's grab it and get out of here! Let's go eat some pizza! Yeah, sweet! 
 
 [ROARING] Whoa, a monster anchovy! [ROARING] I told ya, I hate anchovies! [ROARING] Wait. This looks like a job for... Robo-Carp at your service, masters. Fetch us that pizza! Affirmative.  Fetching, fetchi... [YELLING] Weak! That's it, I'm gonna show this punk who's boss. Yo! Check these suckers out! [GRUNTS] Huh? [SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY] Huh? [GRUNTING] Give him an autograph and I'll go grab the pizza. So, who am I making this out to? [SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY] All right, okay. Whoo, I got it. Let's go! Yeah, let's go! Huh? [ROARS] Wait for me, masters. Mmm, this is tasty, bro! There's anchovies on this! There's anchovies!
