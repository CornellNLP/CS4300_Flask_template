 Narrator : This is Danny. His life changed forever when visited by a time-traveling worm. 
 Are you from the future? 
 [SPITS] You know it. 
 Male narrator : One boy, one worm! These are their adventures. 
 1x02 - "The Banana Peel Problem" 
 Danny : Chili bowl, baloney, choco locka pudding, green things and a bag of milk. 
 The greatest lunch ever assembled! [GRUNTS] 
 [GASPS] 
 [ALL LAUGHING] 
 He's got stuff all over him and he's got chili in his hair. 
 Come in, Future-Worm. 
 Talk to me. 
 Dude, I just slipped on a banana peel in front of the whole school! I got chili in my hair and pudding on my pants. I'm that guy now. 
 Forever! [BEEPING] Future-Worm? 
 Come on! We're going back 27 seconds for a do-over. 
 Come on, let's go! 
 [WHIRRING] 
 Ha! This is gonna be too easy. 
 [LAUGHS]  Not today, banana peel. 
 Future-worm : Good job, man. 
 Whoa! 
 [ALL GRUNTING] 
 Dude! 
 [YELLING] 
 
 
 
 [LOUD CRASH] 
 [CAT YOWLING] 
 Oh, that's not cool either. Let's try this again. 
 This is a job for... Robo-Carp. 
 Dispose of that banana peel! 
 Activate vacuum. Disposing of the banana peel. 
 [LOUD EXPLOSION] 
 Weak. 
 Super weak. 
 You thinking what I'm thinking? 
 Go back and shoot that banana peel into the sun? 
 Yep! 
 Banana peel is secured. 
 Ready for blast off! 
 Sweet. 
 Stop! 
 We are the eternal guardians of banana peel slippage! 
 And? 
 Do you have any idea what will happen if you shoot a banana peel into the sun? 
 We don't want that to happen. 
 Yeah, no way. 
 Then someone must slip on that peel to maintain the balance of the universe. 
 I'll do it then! 
 No, Fyootch. 
 That peel's mine! 
 Good luck, kid. 
 [ALL LAUGHING] 
 All right! You owned it. 
 Thanks, Danny. The balance has been restored. 
 Whoo!
