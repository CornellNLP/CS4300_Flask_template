 Incoming! 
 [CRUNCHING] Nice shot! 
 Great aim, just like your future self. 
 [GASPS] You know my future self? 
 Yeah, your future self rules! 
 You got to meet him. 
 I'd love to.

 Add some cherries and cheese to these chips. 
 [ALL YELLING] 
 We've been cherried and cheesed! 
 Put us down! 
  Um, nope. 
 Both : Weak! Ooh, I got an idea. Hey, Robo-Carp 2001, meet Robo-Carp 1.0. Robo-Carp. I have a grand-pappy? Affirmative. [CRACKLING] Oh, goody! Can we play catch, Grand-pappy? [ALL GRUNTING] Sweet!
