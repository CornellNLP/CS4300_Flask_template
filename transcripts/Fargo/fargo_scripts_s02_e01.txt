 [ Dramatic music plays ] 
 Am I, uh... 
 What are we waiting for? 
 [ Indistinct shouting ] 
 What? 
 [ Footsteps approaching ] 
 The arrows. 
 Gayle's putting in the arrows on Reagan. 
 Yeah, I know. 
 It's-- They said-- 
 Jenny came by the trailer, and she said five minutes, so-- 
 Well, there's a lot of arrows. 
 [ Chuckles ] 
 [ Blows ] 
 So... 
 Should I just go back to my-- 
 No. 
 No, it's, uh-- Jenny said-- 
 What did Jenny say? 
 They're-- they're-- they're putting in the arrows. 
 Yeah, I know. 
 But how long? 
 Doll, just find out, will you? 
 'Cause the Chief is wearing moccasins here. 
 It's goddamn February. 
 [ Chuckles ] 
 So, what's he like, anyway? 
 Who? 
 Dutch. Reagan. 
 Ronnie? 
 Oh, he's a prince. 
 He's a real class act. [ Chuckles lightly ] 
 Yeah. 
 Can I get a blanket? 
 [ Sighs ] 
 [ Snaps fingers ] 
 [ Sighs ] 
 This is the actual field, they tell me. 
 What? 
 It's the actual battlefield-- Massacre at Sioux Falls. 
 I think 300 of your people-- braves-- died here, what, 100 years ago? 
 I'm from New Jersey. 
 Sure, but-- Yeah, you're-- you're-- you're an Indian, right? So-- so that-- that-- that's got to be, uh... 
 Got to be what? 
 No, I'm just saying this battle, it was the last big battle before the end of the-- And what came after-- whew! 
 And, look, I'm a Jew, so believe me, I know tribulation. 
 Yeah. Smoke? 
 Any minute, he'll be out. 
 Man : All right, nobody moves. Everybody is still dead. 
 It is a crisis of confidence. 
 It is a crisis that strikes at the very heart and soul and spirit of our national will. 
 We can see this crisis in the growing doubt about the meaning of our own lives and in the loss of a unity of purpose. 
 Is he kidding me? 
 Reporter : ...has been taken out of the home of John Wayne Gacy... 
 The erosion of our confidence in the future is threatening to destroy _ the social and the political fabric of America. _ 
 That's what I'm trying to engage with here is this untapped potential of yours to sort of think a little bit. 
 ♪ I can't sing, I ain't pretty and my legs are thin ♪ 
 Confidence in the future has supported everything else. 
 ♪ I might not give a answer that you want me to ♪ 
 Hey, there. Sorry. 
 Are you kidding me? 
 You said noon, yeah? 
 Are you kidding me? 
 Hold on, now-- 
 Said 11:00, not noon. 
 What? 
 Say that again. 
 Okay. 
 Say it again. 
 Okay, okay! 
 Where's the goddamn money? 
 I gave it to Ollie, like, yesterday. 
 Don't lie. 
 I mean, I'm-- I'm getting it. 
 It's just a little late. 
 The hell you say. I did the rounds. 
 Everybody paid. 
 'Course they're gonna say that. 
 So you got the money. 
 Well, you know, maybe I needed it for me, for something I-- 
 No, you earn for the family, not for yourself. 
 Yeah. 
 But you're the oldest, and then there's Bear, and that's the throne. 
 What am I ever gonna be except the kid you send out for milk? 
 You're a Gerhardt. 
 That's like Jupiter telling Pluto, "Hey, you're a planet, too." 
 What? 
 If I'm this royalty, how come you got me doing bullshit collections like some nobody chump? 
 Everybody earns. 
 That's the law. 
 Yeah, but what if I got ambitions, you know? 
 You wear short pants till you prove you're a man. 
 I'm a man. 
 You're the comic in a piece of bubble gum! 
 Well, I mean, says you. 
 You got till tomorrow to bring the collection money you owe. 
 [ Scoffs ] Or what? 
 You make me wait for you again, I'll cleave your skull. 
 [ Engine turns over ] 
 Floyd : This is the month's cash, all in. 
 You'll see the problem right away. 
 Light. 
 [ Door opens ] 
 Mm. 
 About time. 
 Give me a break. 
 [ Whistles ] 
 Soon as you ladies are done dancing-- 
 You're right. 
 We're light, even though the transport dollars went up. 
 It's the local business-- gambling and drugs... and whores. 
 Meine keine gute soehne? 
 Don't pin this on me. 
 Or me. 
 We earned. 
 But not Rye. 
 No. 
 But even without his nut, we shouldn't be this short. 
 It's like we're a balloon leaking air all over. 
 Spit it out. 
 What are we talking about here? 
 Tell me, God damn it. 
 Another outfit. 
 I'm taking care of it. 
 From the south. 
 Don't know where. 
 I said I'd handle it. 
 They're coming hard. 
 Son, I'm the iron fist of God. 
 There's not a sane man in three states who would dare to-- 
 Some pissant crew from south no place? 
 You bring me these  hirnlose mutter fotzen  and I'll grind their bones to make my-- 
 Otto? Otto? 
 [ Grunting ] 
 [ Wheezing ] 
 ♪ 
 [ Indistinct talking on radio ] 
 Skip : All right, hear me. 
 I'm saying tomorrow has never been closer than it is right now. 
 It's 11:00 in the morning. 
 Metaphorically, I mean. 
 Hi, friend. Be with you in a-- 
 Check never came, is my point. 
 I'm owed for work I done. 
 Me and the boys, we're owed. 
 [ Sighs, whistles ] 
 Giddyup there, cowboy. 
 Wait your turn, short round. 
 What'd you say? 
 You heard me. 
 [ Gun cocks ] 
 Jesus. Just-- 
 [ Stammers ] 
 It's in the mail, okay? 
 The check. 
 Just-- if it hasn't come by Tuesday, I'll write you another. 
 Yeah, that's right. 
 You better run. 
 Come on, now. 
 He could call a cop. 
 He's not calling anybody. 
 Guys like that, they're just big on the outside. 
 So, where's this miracle contraption? 
 Behold the future. 
 I'm talking money hand over fist. 
 A typewriter. 
 A self-correcting IBM Selectric II electric typewriter with patented high-speed type ball. 
 They're not just for women anymore. 
 And you're sure we're the only-- 
 Sole distributor, Midwest region. 
 Assuming you're willing to forget certain debts owed to your family from the, uh-- 
 Gambling. 
 Yeah, which, you know, I'm not proud. 
 So, as soon as you talk to the judge and she unfreezes the accounts, well, then we can turn on the money spigot. 
 The what? 
 The spigot. 
 It's like where you hook up a hose. 
 Like a fire hose? 
 Any hose. 
 I'm saying once we get those typewriters, the money-- there'll be no stopping it. 
 Uh, which judge, again?

 Now he squeezes and the mustard goes all over his shirt. And he now has no shirt to wear, so now... [ Laughter ] I got to pay up. I'll meet you at the cash register. How was everything? Oh, yeah.

Or what? Or you'll find out, is what. This isn't one of those optional check "A" or "B" scenarios. I'm gonna change your mind. [ Sighs ] One day, the Devil came to God and said, "Let's make a bet between you and me for the soul of a man." And from on high they looked down on Job, a devout man, religious. And the Devil said, "I can change his mind and make him curse your name." And God said, "Try and you will only fail." So the Devil begins. He kills Job's herds and takes his fields. He plagues him with boils and throws him on the ash heap. But Job's mind remains unchanged. So I ask you, son, if the Devil couldn't change Job's mind, how the hell are you gonna change mine? What? You're a little dim, aren't you? Listen, this is-- There's two ways this can go. Is one of them the hard way? Easy-- [ Pounds table ] You know what? There's a fella needs to get his hands on some typewriters. Ugh. Christ. And you're gonna-- You're with that fool. Yeah. You're-- Okay. _ Son, you have three second to pick your ass up and get out of here, or I'm gonna squash you like a bug. [ Laughs ] Okay, look, bitch-- I'm the one do-- [ Gagging ] God damn, my eyes. Now scram before I call the cops. Oh, crap. [ Gunshot ] [ Yelling ] [ Gunshot ] [ Screams ] [ Glass shatters ] [ Gunshot ] [ Breathing heavily ] [ Gunshots ] [ Breathing raggedly ] [ Groaning ] [ Whimpering ] [ Screams ] [ Cash register dings ] [ Bell dings ] Sh-- [ Bell dings ] sh1t. sh1t. [ Gun clicks ] sh1t. sh1t. [ Bullets clinking ] [ Groaning ] [ Breathing heavily ] [ Breathing raggedly ] [ Groans ] [ Breathing heavily ] [ Ominous music plays ] [ Breathing heavily ] [ Tires screech ] [ Engine idling ] Lou : [ Laughs ] "'Oh, whocky!' Cried Joel. 'See what you've done, Polly Pepper?' but Polly didn't hear. Over the big, flat door-stone she sped and met Ben with Little David coming in the gate. His face was just like Phronsie's! And with a cold, heavy feeling at her heart, Polly realized this was no play. 'Oh, Ben!' She cried, flinging her arms around his neck and bursting into tears. 'Don't! Please. I-I wish you wouldn't. Phronsie's got 'em, and that's enough.' 'Got what?' Asked Ben, while Davie's eyes grew to their widest proportions. 'Oh, measles!' Cried Polly, bursting out afresh. 'Hatefulest, horridest measles! And now you're taken!' 'Oh, no, I ain't,' responded Ben cheerfully, who knew what measles were. 'Wipe up, Polly. I'm all right.'" [ Telephone rings ] "'Only my head aches and my eyes feel funny.' Polly, only half reassured, gulped down her sobs and the sorrowful trio repaired to mother. 'Oh, dear me,' ejaculated Mrs. Pepper, sinking in a chair at the dismay at the sight of Ben's red face. 'Whatever will we do now?'" This is a funny book, huh? Yeah. Yeah. Phone call, hon. It's the shop. Okay, you. Sleep, huh? Okay. I'll be back in a minute to tuck you in. Okay. Murder, Eunice says. Three of them over at the Waffle Hut. Hey, uh, you-- you had your thing today. Yeah. This morning. You feel okay? Compared to what? Love Canal? Hmm? Solverson. [ Speaking indistinctly ] Yeah, okay. Tell him not to go inside. Hank on his way? [ Speaking indistinctly ] Okay. You too. Got to go, hon. You okay getting her to bed? Yeah. She's six, not, you know, Pol Pot. Okay. Call if you need, you know, whatever. Mm-hmm. I left my rig there. I hope that's okay. I'm the one who called it in, see? Stopped for waffles, you know? With the blueberries. They come frozen this time of year, I know, but... I-I put my coat on her. It seemed only right. Yeah. "Yeah," it's okay about the coat, or...? [ Bell dings ] [ Sighs ] Yeah. [ Bell dings ] Well, this is a deal. I count three dead. Saw the waitress in the parking lot? Mm. I think she caught one there, then staggered out. Gunman followed, made things permanent. That's Henry Blanton. Got the single-season touchdown record in 10th grade. 31. Still stands. Yeah. Don't know her. North Dakota plates on a Mercedes outside. Tourist, you're thinking? Mm... How's Betsy? You mean you didn't call her before you came over? Well, yeah. Just being polite. Give you a chance to talk about your feelings, should you be so disposed. She's good. Yeah. Ordered this kit of recipe cards. Saw it on the TV. So now every night, we eat delicacies of the world. Mm. Some men like that. Variety. Mm. She put a soufflé on the table last night-- perfectly good casserole-- and lit it on fire with a kitchen match. Huh? Oh, which reminds me-- you're invited for dinner tomorrow. 6:00? Mm-hmm. [ Inhales sharply ] I'll bring a suit of armor. [ Bell dings ] 
 
 [ Police radio chatter ] Skid marks. Yeah. I see them. 'Course, connecting those to this deal here would be what we call "jumping to a conclusion." Based on the number of bodies, I'm thinking we've got one car too many in the parking lot. Yeah. So, the shooter's got a wound or two in him from the steak knife. Two blood trails lead out. One to the waitress, now deceased. The other to the road here, where he absconds, leaving a few dollars behind. Uh-huh. Why not take his own car? Unclear at this time. There's a shoe in that tree. There sure is. So, uh, this a local matter or do the State Police want it? We do not. [ Chuckles ] Local matter it is. And, of course, any support the State can provide. Yeah, of course. See you tomorrow night, then, eh? 6:00. Be ready for anything. That's a shoe, all right. Okay, then. Okay, then. Noreen? Hmm? Ed's leaving. Okay, then. Oh, hey. May as well take these with you. Boolie Hendricks paid but never picked them up. Chops? Mm. Wasted meat's a crime. Or it should be. Okay, then. Okay, then. Okay, then. [ Indistinct conversations ] B-8. B-8. So, Ho Chi Minh-- Jesus, kid. Keep up. Ho Chi Minh was just a front man. Enemy number one straight out of central casting. AKA a stuffed shirt for the military industrial complex. The what's that, now? Jesus, Mary, and Joseph. Ike's farewell address? The military industrial complex. Wheels inside wheels, special interests. N-33. N-33. I thought there'd be a band tonight. Boys. I-17. I-17. Balls. Tell this dipshit pissant about Ike's farewell address. You mean the military industrial complex? See? He knows. 'Course, we've been to war. Nothing complex about it. How come you're in uniform, then, Lou? Didn't you work this morning? Three dead at the Waffle Hut. No sh1t. Yeah, a real mess. Women, too. Hank's thinking botched robbery. Oh, sure. That's what they  want  you to think. Who? They. Bjorn : B-11. You know, the powers that be. It's a classic story. Oswald acted alone. The girl in the polka-dot dress. The what, now? The girl in the-- After Kennedy the other was shot-- Robert, in LA-- People saw a woman in a polka-dot dress running out of the hotel yelling, "We got him!" But who did they arrest? Bjorn : I-23. I-23. An A-rab. Racist pricks. It's a diner robbery in Minnesota, Karl. Not a presidential assassination. Oh, sure. That's how it starts-- with something small like a break-in at the Watergate Hotel. But just watch. This thing's only getting bigger. G-53. G-53. Well, I better get home. [ Clears throat ] Betsy had her chemo today. God! Sonny : What is it, Karl? It's just-- God damn. Unacceptable is what it is. A woman like that in the prime of her... With a young daughter. Bjorn : N-40. N-40. Tell her if John McCain could hold out for 5 1/2 years against Viet Cong thumbscrews, she can beat this cancer bullshit in her sleep. I'll make sure to mention that.

Oh, you know, I forgot earlier-- She made you something at school today. Yeah? She knows I don't smoke, right? You could start. [ Laughs ] Hmm. Your dad said he'd be over Sunday in a suit of armor. Ugh. Geez. You light one soufflé on fire-- [ Laughs ] [ Sighs ] So, I'm getting excited about this seminar. The which? You remember, hon. It's next weekend. Constance is taking me. Lifespring. Everybody's doing it. Oh, yeah. I really think this course is gonna help me actualize, you know, fully. Re-examine old reflex patterns-- the ones that keep my life from working. From... 'Cause  we're  doing great, yeah? Oh, yeah. [ Chuckles lightly ] I just mean me, you know? As a person. Yeah. Yeah. [ Both chuckle ] Well, Bud asked again if I was interested in maybe taking over the butcher shop. Mm. Said he's thinking of retiring end of the year. Just had the end of the year, huh? Yeah, I guess he means this year, but wouldn't that be great? Me owning the shop, maybe you take over the salon one day. You know, unless we got a whole litter of kids by then. Yeah, that's-- We talked about that. We're trying, but it takes time, you know? Yeah. Yeah, of course. Though, uh... hon-- "trying"-- I mean, last time I checked, there's just the one way to make a baby, you know? Did that last weekend, didn't we? It was Bear Lake last weekend. You said you didn't want to-- not with Kevin and Sally-- Hon. I ju-- [Chuckles] I just-- uh-- I just love you, is all. So, so much. And, come on, our kids would be amazing. [ Thud in distance ] Oh, shoot! Here. Hon, let me-- No, it-it's fine. I'm-- I'm such a bumble sometimes. [ Thud in distance ] What the heck? I-I love you, too, hon, so, so much. Maybe we should... Maybe do it right now. Here? No, silly. In the bedroom. Come on. [ Thud in distance ] Geez. I better go see what that... We can-- I'll wear that nightie you like. Ed : What the-- Hon? Didn't I tell you? I kind of hit a deer. You hit a... Are you-- you okay? Yeah, no, I-I'm just, you know, shook up, mostly. Geez. Well, insurance should cover most-- [ Thud ] Actually, I-- I think I need to sit down, hon. [ Thump ] Can we go in the kitchen? [ Thumping ] Heck, hon, did you bring the deer home? [ Thump ] Peggy : Hon, don't. [ Thumping continues ] Hon. Hon, don't. Hon! Come back! [ Thumping continues ] Don't. Ah, geez. T-there's a-- [ Growls ] It's a man. There's a man in the-- [ Both grunting ] [ Gasping ] [ Grunts ] [ Grunts ] [ Whimpers ] [ Panting ] Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh-- oh, my God. Hon. Geez, hon. Sorry. Are y-you okay? No, it's-- I'm fine. Who-- You got to believe me. I-I thought he was dead. What? When I hit him, I thought he was-- You hit  him? [ Tires screeching ] You hit  him  with the car? You-- you said a deer. [ Whimpers ] You hit him. Why-- why didn't you go to the police or the hospital? He ran out into the road, hon. What was I supposed to do? Yeah, so-- so you brought him home, made dinner-- Hamburger Helper. I panicked, okay? We-- we got to call the police. Why didn't you call the police? No. We gotta-- Maybe he's not-- No, no. No. I-- I-- Hon, listen to me. I ran over him. Hit and run. And-- and then you stabbed him with a gardening tool. The cops-- do you think they're gonna believe us? I don't know. But-- but people are gonna look for him. But-- but look. Look. I-I was careful. I-I drove the back way all the way home. You drove the-- Hon, a-a man's dead. Well, that's why we have to clean it up and-- and tell people I hit a deer or... We could run. What? Go to California. Calif-- [ Sighs ] No. [ Scoffs ] We have a life here, hon. A family. I'm gonna buy the shop. Okay, then. - Okay, then. Okay, then. And we're gonna start a f-family. Well, start again, I'm saying. I don't want to. Okay, then... You-- Then, hon, look at me. If we're gonna get clear of this, then we're gonna have to clean it up. Pretend it didn't happen. 'Cause if this comes out, if this-- then all the things you want, that  we  want-- that's over. [ Scoffs ] I go to jail and maybe you also. And then there's no shop and no family. No kids. [ Breathing heavily ] Okay. Okay, then. We-- we clean it up. We clean it up. [ Sighs ] Well, should we call that Saturday? I suppose we better. She'll be up at 5:00 anyway wanting to play dolls. And I know how fond you are of your doll-playing time. [ Chuckles ] [ Sighs ] Good night, Mr. Solverson. Good night, Mrs. Solverson, and all the ships at sea. [ Ominous music plays ] Otto : [ Breathing heavily ] Floyd : O-Otto? [ Wheezing ] [ Sobs ] Otto! No! [ Clatter ] [ Thud ] No! Oh! Otto! Live! Get the doctor! Go now! Now! Otto. Call the doctor. Go! So, as you see on page 16 of the prospectus, the main component of our Northern expansion strategy involves the absorption of the Gerhardt Family Syndicate, headquartered in Fargo, ND. Now, the Gerhardts control trucking and distribution for the entire Northern Midwest. It's a family business started in 1931 by Dieter Gerhardt... [ Lighter strikes ] ...now deceased, and taken over in 1950 by his son Otto. Now, not in the report but of relevance to this meeting, Old Otto had a stroke yesterday in the family compound in North Dakota. Man : Leaving who in charge? Unclear. His wife, Floyd, she's tough, but, you know, a girl. And then there are the three sons-- Dodd, Bear, and Rye. And of course they all want their shot at the throne, which the boys in Research think provides a tactical opportunity for us to move aggressively to acquire or absorb their operation. And if you can't and the current business owners resist? We liquidate. Approved. ♪ go to sleep, you little babe ♪
