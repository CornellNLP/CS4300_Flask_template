 Um, why "Irregular"? 
 Well, they put a ladies' sock in with the gents'. 
 Which one's which? 
 It's unclear. 
 Ah. 
 Eh, I'll roll the dice. 
 Uh, how much? 
 You tell me. 
 Say again? 
 The sign says "Best Offer." 
 What are you offering? 
 Well, I mean, uh... 
 Eh, what's fair? 
 Well, that's not for me to say. 
 It's three pairs of socks, half of them ladies'. 
 Probably not a million dollars. 
 Uh... 
 [Chuckles] 
 Right. 
 Well, I don't want to take advantage. 
 2 bucks. 
 Or if that's, uh... 
 3 bucks? 
 5. 
 Tell you what, you give me $55, I'll give you the socks... and throw in this 12-Gauge. 
 Thought you were getting socks. 
 In the bag. 
 What the heck are you gonna do with that? 
 It's for protection. 
 Just be careful you don't blow your own face off. 
 Not loaded, is it? 
 Well, if anyone could shoot theirselves in the face with an unloaded firearm, it's you.

 Lester! Yeah! I... [Grunts] Ahh... [Washing machine continues thumping] [Phone line trills] (Malvo) Yeah? (Lester) My wife... she's in the basement, dead. And, uh, I'm freaking out here. I don't know what to do. (Malvo) Lester, have you been a bad boy? (Lester) Ah! Jeez. Yeah. Can you come over? What did you do? [Breathing heavily] You killed her. [Suspenseful music] ♪ ♪ [Door opens] (Vern) Evening, Lester. (Lester) What... what do you want? (Vern) Well, I suppose first, I'd like to come in. Is Pearl home? (Lester) Ah, no, no, she's at my brother's. (Vern) Lester, listen to me very carefully. I need you to get down on the ground. (Lester) Okay, now, wait... wait just a second. (Vern) Lester, on the ground. (Lester) This is not what it looks like. Look, I'm sorry... about...  electrocuting you. I was just... This is obviously... ... a misunderstanding. 'Cause like... like I said, I'm just an insurance salesman. Now, that is not... I got noth... The stuff that you're mixed up in.. Not... not that you're.. I'm just say... Well... So you... you see? [Clears throat] You said "Him." What? On the ice... you said "Him." You said it was him. Not you. Him. Mm, yeah. [Chuckles] Well... well, I'm... I'm just guessing here, but, uh, well, that Hess was not head-stabbed by a girl. No, no. No, no. No, you said it like you had a face in mind. Uh-uh. No, wait. [Screaming] [Muffled screaming] Uh... Stay with me. Lester. Oh, God, please. Please. Stay with me. I need a name. Uh... huh. I need a name. Again. No, wait! Please! Wait. [Whispers] God. [Sighs] Lester. No! Malvo! Malvo. Malvo? Is that a first name? [Softly] Gaahh... [Sighs] Lester. Hmm? Eventually you just swallow your tongue and you die like a fish. Lorne, I think. It's Lorne, like the fella from  Bonanza. Lorne Malvo? Where is he? I'm gonna throw up. No. No, you're not. If you puke in here, I'll kill you. I mean, I'll actually kill you, okay? Okay. Lester. Mm-hmm. I need a location. Okay... [Grunts] He took... he took my car. They called me, told me it was impounded in Duluth. So he's probably... I got a picture... There's a picture of him. Picture of him up here. Law enforcement, he had it. It's from the... what do you call it? An APB. So... [Clicks tongue] What? Lorne Malvo? Yeah? Mm. [Buzzer] He killed him. He killed Hess. I-I mean... (Knutson) Okay. You two are free to go. Bail's been paid. [Sighs] Oh, God. What if we wanna stay? (Knutson) Pardon? I don't know, I mean, what if we like it here? [Chuckles] Yeah. That's a good one. On your feet. You have any doubt we can find you? No. Hey, buddy, you might wanna have a doctor look at that hand, though. Looks like it smarts. [Buzzer] [Retches] (Male announcer on TV) Are some of the largest snakes found in the world. (Man #1) Any members of that python family are ambush predators. They remain motionless before they strike. (Woman) It's not common for them to attack humans unless, of course, they're starving. (Male announcer) Now, advancements in the technological arena allow us to examine their existence in the Everglades. (Man #1) Oh, look ahead, there, there... No way around it. I said, "More sand." Back then? Yeah. Wild goose chase. Salt's okay. Hang on. Frank calling. Well, Chief, there've been some interesting developments while you were... Chief, Frank on the line. New storm data. Yeah, Frank, what you got then? This case is, uh, really... it's heating up. That much, huh? Jeez. Saying 2 feet new accumulation. [Clicks tongue] So, uh, we got the phone dump back from Lester's from the night of the murders. Okay, thanks much. You too. Call Hoenecker with State, see if we can get some more plows, and, uh, make sure they're plowing the Chief's drive every few hours. Can't have Ida going into labor under a snowbound scenario. [Clicks tongue] Okay. Yah. Now, what's all this? I was saying we got the phone dump back. And right around the time Pearl died, an outgoing call was placed from Lester's  to Leroy's Motor Inn, so I made a call. No one asked you to... I know, but you were in Duluth, so I figured... Left Knutson in charge. Right. So I made a call, and get this. Lorraine, the manager... Lorraine Abbey. Yeah. Yah. Uh, no, sir, Lorraine Babbit. Curly hair, looks like she dries her eyebrows on with a sharpie. No, sir, this is a severe woman with hard hair. Anyway, she IDs a photo of the suspect from the naked fella kidnapping. Says he stayed one night, that being the night Hess was killed. She got a name for him too. Lorne Malvo. And you found this how? Like I said, ... call was placed from Lester's house to the motel where the suspect was staying. So I talk to housekeeping, and they say this Malvo fella left behind some tokens from The Lucky Penny. (Cindy) They wanna know how many plows. At least three, don't ya think? At least three. Yeah, he says he can give you two good ones and a pickup with baby plow. Sir. Yeah, I'm listening. Okay, good. So I go and talk to the lady that Hess was with, the dancer, right? And she says that before he was stabbed... - Hold on. ...Hess was laughing about this fella that he bullied. Broke the poor guy's nose, she said. The same day. Chief, is that a yes on the baby plow? So right away I'm thinking, who do we know who got his nose br... the day Hess died? No. Lester. Wait. Chief. So you see, Hess breaks Lester's nose. Lester goes to the Emergency Room,  where he meets our suspect. That night, Hess gets killed. The next day, Lester places a call to the motel where our suspect is staying, and shortly thereafter or abouts, Mrs. Nygaard and the Chief are murdered. Chief. Yeah. Tell him I'll call him back. [Sighs] He's gotta call ya back. Son of a bitch. Yes, sir. So I'm thinking maybe this is a murder-for-hire type deal, right? Where Lester hires this Malvo fella to kill Hess, only maybe Lester don't got the money to pay, so things get sour. Listen, I know it's not my case, but I'd like your permission to go back to Lester's house and see what he has to say. Not at his house. Okay. His work then. No, I'm saying he's not at his house. He's in a holding cell. Knutson says Lester took a swing at him. I'm not sure if he was drunk or what. He's in custody? I told Dougie to keep him overnight. You know, let him sleep it off. Well... I mean, we gotta talk to him, don't ya think? I guess we'd better. [Wind rushing] [Knock at door] I need to use your computer. Yeah. [Grunts] It's on the front.

[Inhales] He steals a car, I pull him over, he drives away, car's impounded, and he stays in Duluth. He stays in Duluth. I stop him on the street. On that street. On foot. He was on that street on foot. (Boy on walkie-talkie) Come in, Greta. Over. (Gus) Why was he on that street on foot? Dad? Do you wanna... (Boy) - Greta. Come in, Greta. Oh, yeah, right. Okay. It's almost bedtime. And, hey, I may go out for a bit. (Greta) Okay. Come in. Over. Back for more, huh? I need a police scanner. Got a special on remote control helicopters. Can you monitor police activity on it? Doubt it. I'll just stick with the scanner. Okay. I got handheld or dashboard mountable. Oh, also... got this one in pink. Do I look like I want a pink police scanner? I don't know. Could be a gift for a lady. And in your experience, uh, police scanners? Is that a gift ladies get wet for?

One day, the man sees another article. He decides he was foolish to think just giving money was enough. So he goes to the doctor and says, "Doctor, I want to donate a kidney." The doctors do the surgery. It's a complete success. After, he knows he should feel good, but he doesn't, for people are still suffering. So he goes back to the doctor. He says, "Doctor, this time I want to give it all." The doctor says, "What does that mean, 'Give it all'?" He says, "This time I want to donate my liver. But not just my liver. I want to donate my heart, I want to donate my corneas, but not just my corneas. I want to give it all away. Everything I am. All that I have." The doctor says, "A kidney is one thing, but you can't give away your whole body piece by piece. That's suicide." And he sends the man home. But the man cannot live knowing that the people are suffering and he could help. So he gives the one thing he has left. His life. (Gus) And does it work? Does it stop the suffering? You live in the world. What do you think? So he killed himself for nothing? Did he? Well, I mean... [Sighs] You're saying... [Chuckles] What are you saying?

Now, when you say, uh, "foreign object"? Shotgun pellet, looked like. Had some fabric attached to it. It's possible the pellet  passed through something before getting into Lester's hand.

Greatest empire in human history, founded by wolves. You know what wolves do. They hunt. They kill. It's why I never bought into Boy's raised by wolves and becomes friends with a bear and a panther. I don't think so. [Chuckles] I knew a guy once, had a 110-pound rottweiler. And one night this girl thought it'd be funny to get down on all fours and let the dog hump her.

And he's not leaving till he gets what he came for. Well, the girl, too late, realizes the kind of mistake she's made, But the dog had other ideas. Had to shoot it behind the ear to get it off of her. I don't, uh... I don't... Well, I'm saying that ... the Romans raised by wolves, they see a guy turning water into wine, what do they do?

Well, see, I'm not sure what I'm looking for is the problem. Plus, you know, it's dark out, so maybe go back out tomorrow. Oh.

Well, friend, there's no need for that. This is a nice neighborhood. Children play in the streets. My children. We have block parties, fruit punch. We don't need a man in a dark car doing things.

No, you have black eyes. You're trouble. I'm going inside, and I'm calling the cops. Which building? The one with the Jew bus outside? There it is. Now the truth comes out. You know, some people think you don't need alarms on second-story windows. Think they can save a few bucks, you know, and still be safe. Another way they save money is they don't hook up the alarm to the phone line. So the bell rings, but the cops don't come. Or they come, but only after the neighbors call. Which, um, if this community's tight, as you say, you know... just might be quick enough to save your life... or your children's lives. Maybe. Se'irim. You're a nice guy.
