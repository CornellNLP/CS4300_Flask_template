 Lester, is this what you want? 
 Yes.

 (Lorne) See you later, Lester. 
 Okay. 
 Hon, get dressed. 
 Lester, are you okay? 
 Oh. 
 Vegas PD's gonna send over some pictures from the hotel security camera, so don't leave town for a while. 
 I may have some more questions. 
 Ready to go? 
 What? I thought we weren't gonna go. 
 Acapulco, here we come. 
 Do you think you could run in? 
 The passports are in the safe. 
 There's some cash in there too. 
 It's cold out there. 
 You're sweet.

 And to drink? 
 Beer would change things for the better. 
 Eh, family place, I'm afraid. 
 Oh, okay. 
 Two ginger ales, then.

Well, she dropped me off, grabbed something over at the shop, and said she had to pick something up. Yeah, you said that. Want me to keep hers warm till she gets here? Oh, yeah, that's... Although, like I said, she should be any second now. You know, there was a fella in here earlier asking about you. About me? Yeah, silver hair. Little goatee. Said he went by your old house, but you moved. [Clears throat] Yeah. Well, we got the house up... What... what did you tell him? Said if he wanted to leave a number, I'd give it to you. He couldn't see his way clear to it, so we left it at that. Can't say I much liked his demeanor. Well, sorry for the bother. No bother. Thought you ought to know.

There is some consensus this Malvo fella may be back. Where's Molly? Left her at the precinct last night. Had Lester Nygaard in custody, about to talk to him. I'm going after her. Keep an eye on Greta. Believe me, I mean to. [Car door opens and closes] Okay, so the plan is, we fan out. Prowlers on all the main roads looking for Malvo. Encircle the town, in other words. There's pic... Yeah. Well, there are three main roads, so actually more of a triangle. There's photos of the suspect in your packets. We hear he might have changed his look, though, so silver hair now, brushed back,  possibly a goatee. Drives a red BMW, possibly stolen. The FBI's sending a team, and in the meantime, the two original agents are staking out Lester's house. Molly, Gus on one. Yeah. I'll be out there with you coordinating maneuvers, so... Pass those out for me. Thanks. Yeah, hon? Hey, I've been calling. Yeah, I know. Sorry, it's been-- Is it true? Is he back? Yeah, I just... I just finished briefing the guys, so... We tried to crack Lester, but he wouldn't flinch, so the plan is, now we're gonna use him as bait. Molly... Yeah, so things are... they're real busy here, hon. Look, hon. Don't, okay? I got to ask you not to... Don't go out there. You, personally, don't go looking for-- It's my job. Yeah, I know, and you're amazing and the best, and I have no doubt that if you wanted, you could handcuff Al Capone. But some days, sometimes you get forces you can't control. Bad luck, you know? Bad luck. Yeah, and this is all-- If it really is him, Malvo, I just... with everything we've been working for, you know,  our family, and-- Gus. And I know it's not fair. It's not. It's your job, and I am just a mailman, but you've got a precinct full of cops, Bottom line, I can't make her go to another funeral, you know? Yeah. Okay, don't worry. I'll just... Yeah, I'll run things from here. Okay, good. Good. I'm in the car, coming over. No, don't. That's not... No, just go home. Be with our girl. Hey, is my dad there? Yeah, yeah, he's on the porch with a shotgun. [Chuckles] Got to love a man who keeps his word, right? So you promise? Yeah, I won't leave the building until they call and tell me he's surrounded. No, until he's dead. I'll call you in a little bit, okay?

We're gonna take Lester home, sit on the house, see if we can't draw this Malvo fella out. You okay, Chief? [Sighs] Hanging it up after this. What's that? I quit, is what I'm saying. Don't got the stomach for it, not like some. [Scoffs] Wearing the badge, seeing the lengths people are capable of, the inhumanity. [Sighs] What ever happened to saying good morning to your neighbors and shoveling their walk and bringing in each other's toters? Well, still goes on. Yeah, but not the same. I used to have positive opinions about the world, you know, about people. Used to think the best. Now I'm looking over my shoulder. An unquiet mind, that's what the wife calls it. The job has got me staring into the fireplace, drinking. I never wanted to be the type to think ... big thoughts about the nature of things and... all I ever wanted was a stack of pancakes and a V8. So I'm recommending that you take over as Chief. Oh, I-I appreciate that, but I... No, no, you're the real deal. You got the instincts and the disposition. I didn't see it before, but now-- And Vern saw it. I know that. And so I'm hoping that after you have the baby, you come back here and take things over. I-I will think about that. I will. Got to talk to Gus, so... So you're okay with the plan then, call in the cavalry and set a trap? Yeah, we're a small-time force. We're not equipped for, you know, urban warfare. Most of these guys can't shoot a can off a fence. Okay. Chin up, Chief. [Police radio chatter] [Keypad beeping] [Line trilling] [Phone rings] Police. Yes, this is FBI Main. I'm looking for my agents.

Well... well, we're not officially open yet. But I don't see why not. Hold on. I'll grab the keys. Shotgun. [Engine turns over] [Engine revving] Okay. So we're letting you go. About time. Yeah, and so the FBI fellas are gonna drive you home. Not necessary. I can call a cab. Yeah, well, like I said, we're letting you go, but at the same time, a wanted fugitive has been spotted in town, and we think he's got intentions towards you, so ride home's not really optional. Well, they're not coming in the house. Sure, okay, we can play it that way, but they're still gonna stick around for a while, keep an eye on things.

There was a fella once running for a train, and he's carrying a pair of gloves, this man. He drops a glove on the platform, but he doesn't notice. And then later on, inside the train, he's sitting by the window, and he realizes that he's just got this one glove left. But the train's already started pulling out of the station, right? So what does he do? He opens the window, and he drops the other glove onto the platform. That way, whoever finds the first glove can just have the pair. So what are you telling me?

Now, you can take the cabbage, but then the fox would eat the rabbit. Or you can take the fox, but the rabbit would eat the cabbage. What are you asking... Same thing on the other side. You could leave the rabbit there alone, but what happens when you bring the fox over ... and go back for the cabbage? Forget it. My partner doesn't know what he's talking about. I already told you, just eat all three of them. Can I only row them across in one direction? No, no, either way. Well, then you row the rabbit across, and the fox won't eat the cabbage. Then you go back for the fox, and when you drop him off, put the rabbit back in the boat and go get the cabbage. Only this time, you leave the rabbit behind, ... and then you row the cabbage back across. Again, the fox will not eat the cabbage, and then you go back for the rabbit. That's it.
