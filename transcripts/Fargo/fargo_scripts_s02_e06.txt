 Ed, no. 
 Hank : Peggy, come here. 
 This is-- You're so out of line, Sheriff! 
 Peggy. Peggy. 
 You can't just ruin people's lives! 
 Peggy, Peggy, can you come back inside? 
 Huh? Come on. Come on. Parade them around main street for something they didn't do, falsely accused. 
 No. Mnh-mnh. 
 Peggy. 
 No. You're not gonna prove my Ed did anything wrong! 
 It's unprovable!

 Feels like the top might just spin right off the globe these days and take you along with it. 
 [ Chuckles ] 
 What's that for? 
 I'm just imagining you parachutin' into the Mekong Delta, telling the Black Pajamas to leave your husband alone. 
 Shoulda. Could've saved a lot of lives if wives and mothers from both sides came and dragged their fool men home by the ear. 
 Anything I can do to help this mess? 
 Uh, yeah. You can, uh, take Noreen home with ya. 
 Her place burned down with the shop, and we both know she's just a kid, emancipated or not. 
 Noreen. 
 Hey, Ed. I told 'em what you said. 
 Quiet now, both of ya. 
 Come home soon. 
 We both know that's not likely. 
 Come on, dear. Let's get you home and in a bath. 
 Betsy : I'll make us some cocoa, all right? 
 She's a nice lady.

 I was thinking about Elron the other day. 
 Before. 
 His face, you know? 
 Trying to remember. 
 I was 10 when they came. 
 Soldiers in uniform with that... folded up flag. 
 You were in Chicago, I think. 
 Mom says. 
 There's that picture in the hall of you and all the kids. 
 That winter in Bear Lake.

 Grandpa, who stows away on a boat, comes to America, and builds an empire. 
 Compared to that, what have you ever done? 
 Or me? Arm or no arm? 
 Now, you can have the strap or the buckle, 'cause I can't have you knocking me around, not in front of the men. 
 Give me that buckle, you piece of sh1t.

 No, not collect. I... [Sighs] 
 I gotta stay up with the latest trends, you know, in my line of work. 
 [ Cabinet closes ] 
 Well, that explains the-- the beauty mags. 
 Well, there's more to life than Minnesota, you know. 
 Do you think, uh-- 
 I-I know there's a lot of questions, but I just-- 
 I got a, um, I got this seminar tomorrow, Lifespring, and, uh, I gotta drive up to Sioux Falls first thing, so... 
 Um... 
 [ Sighs ] Well, now, I-I got five dead since Saturday, including the one tonight in the burned down butcher shop, and your husband is currently in jail, so I wouldn't count on getting there early. 
 No, I mean, that's terrible. 
 But what can Ed-- I mean... 
 Attempted robbery and those two men-- 
 No, no, no, it wasn't a robbery, Peggy. 
 Those men came for your husband. They came to kill him. 
 [ Scoffs ] You don't know that for sure, Sheriff. 
 You're just trying to be dramatic, trying to scare me. 
 I assure you, I am not. And when I say five dead, I'm only talking about  inside  the city limits. 
 Reports are 15 more bodies-- 15 more bodies up in Fargo. 
 This is a turf war between the Kansas City mob and this Gerhardt family you've gotten yourself mixed up with. 
 Stop saying that. 
 Me and Ed-- we're just bystanders. 
 Not even. Uh, disconnected-- him with the shop, and-- and me just trying to actualize fully, ya know? 
 Be the best me I can be because these are modern times, you know, and a woman-- well, she just doesn't have to be a wife and a mother no more. 
 She can be... There's nothing she can't be. 
 [ Sips ] 
 You're a little touched, aren't ya? 
 [ Gulps ] 
 What? 
 It's not that there's anything wrong with that. 
 Don't get me wrong. 
 It's just, uh, the time and place in which you're-- 
 Well, you know, if you mean I got dreams, then yeah. 
 And... maybe I don't see it all like everybody else, but I got plans. 
 We-- we got plans, and you can't just come in here... 
 Yeah, Peggy? 
 ...and derail-- 
 They tried to kill your husband. 
 I mean, they burned down his shop. 
 You think that's the end of it? 
 Well, I mean... Look, right? 
 Ed-- he really... he loved that place. 
 [ Clicks tongue ] But life's a journey, ya know? 
 That's what John Hanley Sr. says. 
 He's the founder of Lifespring. 
 Life's a journey, and the one thing you don't do on a journey is stay in one place, right? 
 So maybe we'll... 
 I don't know, go to California or... 
 California? 
 ...someplace, now that the shop's gone. 
 Peggy... before you, uh... 
 [ Mug clatters ] 
 Before you start making plans, you should know I got a forensic team coming down from the Twin Cities in the morning. 
 And I know it's been repaired, but we're gonna check your car for blood. 
 Microscopically, I mean, which... you'd be amazed at what we can find on the atomic level these days. 
 No. I mean... 
 [ Sets down mug ] 
 Y-you can't do that, of course, without permission from the owner, you know, so-- 
 Oh, we got permission, about an hour ago. 
 You sold the car to Sonny Greer, didn't ya? 
 Earlier at the body shop. 
 And Sonny now is the owner of record, and he was more than happy to-- 
 No. No, you can't. 
 That's... Hold-- hold on. 
 Peggy. Peggy. I'm serious now. 
 Better you tell me before I get a fistful of evidence. 
 What happened that night when you hit Rye Gerhardt with your car? 
 I-I'm the victim here, Lou. 
 Ed. 
 [ Sighs ] 
 I mean, 'cause... 
 I sat in your living room last night and gave you the chance. 
 You and Peggy both, I gave ya the chance to c-- 
 I know, but you gotta understand, w-we're just trying to-- you know, me, I'm just trying to protect my family. 
 There was a cleaver in the man's head, son, which Noreen said was you. 
 Not to mention there's a war going on up in Fargo that you may have started when you ran over that Gerhardt boy in Peggy's car. 
 You or-- or-- or-- or Peggy or both. 
 This is all just so crazy. 
 And I can't stop thinking about that book. 
 Noreen's book. It's, like, stuck in my head. 
 What? What book? 
 It's about this guy who, every day, he-- he pushes this rock up this hill. 
 Like a boulder. 
 And then every night, it just rolls back down. 
 But he doesn't stop. 
 You know, he just-- he keeps goin'. 
 And-- and he wakes up every day and starts pushin'. 
 By which I-I-I guess I'm-- I'm sayin' it doesn't matter what they throw at me. 
 I'm gonna take care of what's mine. 
 And... 
 These boys aren't gonna rest until you're dead, son. 
 Possibly Peggy, too. 
 I want a lawyer. 
 [ Sighs ] 
 Lou, I-I... 
 I need one. I'm-- I'm askin' ya for one. 
 Ed, that's not-- 
 No, I-I seen the shows... 
 You don't... 
 ...on TV. 
 You don't... 
 I seen the shows on TV. 
 "Ironside" and... 
 [ Sighs, stammers ] 
 This is all too important to make mistakes here. 
 So get me a lawyer, a good one. 
 And if he says... then I'll-- I'll talk. 
 No, Sonny, they just called themselves plumbers, but what it was, was a special investigative unit inside the White House. 
 Bluth : Hey, Karl. 
 Percy. 
 Got a customer for you. 
 A client, I guess you'd... 
 Over at the station. 
 Ed Blumquist? Butcher's assistant? 
 I guess he's mixed up in all the craziness. 
 You hear that, Sonny? 
 There's a crisis at the highest level, so who do they call? 
 [ Glass thuds ] 
 The best lawyer in town. 
 Aren't ya the only lawyer in town, Karl? 
 Yes, but that's because I scared away all my-- 
 [ Bottles clink ] 
 Oh. Great Caesar's ghost. 
 Would appear I'm a little unstable. Um... 
 Okay there, Karl? 
 Want me to tell Lou you need a few hours? 
 Fair-may ton bush, son. 
 I am sound in mind and body and ready to run circles around the inferior minds of the Rock County Sheriff's Department. 
 Lou is a State Cop, Karl. 
 Shut up, Sonny. 
 Will need you to drive, however. 
 My question for you is, how come after you hit that fella, you didn't just drive to the hospital or waved down a passin' motorist and ask 'em to call the cops? 
 You say it like these things happen in a vacuum. 
 Like it's a test. 
 Check "A" or "B." 
 But it's like... decisions you make in a dream, ya know? 
 I'll tell you what, if it was me, and we had to run... 
 I wouldn't look back. 
 For what? The dazzle? 
 This house? 
 This is  Ed's  house. He grew up here.
