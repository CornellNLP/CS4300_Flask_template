  Okay. 
  Let's go back. 
  What happened before then? 
  Kaya: Well, I come out of the bathroom stall, and he's standing there. 
  He started crying a little, and then he got down on the floor and started trying to sniff me. 
  [Pen scratching on paper] 
  Sort of like a dog. 
  Well, it is good thing that your company brought me in, because that does say that they wanna get to the bottom of this. 
  Did you talk to anyone else about it? 
  A friend or, um, family member? 
  No, I just... 
  I just wanted things to go back to normal. 
  I didn't even wanna think about it. 
  I understand. 
  So it's just my word against his? 
  That happens a lot in cases like this. 
  It does make things very difficult. 
  No. 
  f*ck it. 
  What he did is not okay. 
  He needs to be stopped. 
  Right? 
  Right. 
  Yeah. 
  That's always the hope.

  I filed a claim. 
  Kaya: And what happened? 
  They picked it apart. 
  They said I was liar, that I wanted money. 
  [Inhales sharply] 
  In the end, I got this ridiculous little settlement and he got six weeks paid leave. 
  When he came back, he and his friends, they went out to lunch to celebrate.
