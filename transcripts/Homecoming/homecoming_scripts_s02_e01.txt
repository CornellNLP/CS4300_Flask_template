 The facility housed 18 soldiers at a time. 
   We used their medical records  to find men who had basic PTSD markers. 
   We delivered the medication  to see if the memories were deleted. 
   You don't remember that? 
   No. 
   Shrier: You just took them? 
   You even know what they are? 
   You forced a-a second meal on Walter Cruz  who'd already had his full dose? 
   He's gonna be f*cking incapacitated! 
   I have a situation here. 
   Somewhat urgent. 
   What have you done to him? 
   I'm looking into a complaint  regarding Walter Cruz. 
   I just have some questions about a Geist program. 
   "Homecoming." Are you familiar with that? 
   Not really, no. 
   Although that program's no longer operational. 
   You bring this thing home for me,  I could see you moving up to Redwood. 
   And then maybe we get you out to the farm. 
   Meet Mr. 
  Geist. 
   What were you doing at the Homecoming facility?
