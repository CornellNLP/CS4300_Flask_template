  Morisseau. 
  Thanks for holding. 
  I'm looking at Walter's file here. 
  You said the program is called "Homecoming"? 
  - Yes. 
  "Homecoming. 
  " - Okay, yes I haven't heard from my son in two weeks, and I've been trying to reach him, but there's no listed Yeah, so, ma'am, that's not a V. A. 
  program. 
  What are you talking about? 
  Yeah, I'm seeing here, uh, it's administered by a private contractor Geist Emergent Group. 
  Geist? 
  Yeah. 
  It's not here at the V. A. 
  That's all we have. 
  Is there anything else I can help you with? 
  No. 
  (SIGHS) 
  Glory? 
  You ready? 
  We're gonna be late. 
  - What's this? 
  - Geist. 
  EVITA: So? 
  What about them? 
  - They made all of that? 
  - No. 
  But they make household products, like shampoo, drain cleaner, - laundry detergent - So? 
  And they just want him to talk about his feelings? 
  No. 
  Him who? 
  What are you talking about? 
  Walter. 
  The place that they sent him to. 
  It doesn't make sense. 
  I know you're upset, doudou mwen. 
  I know you miss him. 
  That's not what I'm talking about. 
  Why would a company that makes shampoo and drain cleaner Glory, you are my sister and I love you. 
  But when you get like this I don't need to convince you. 
  - Where are you going? 
  - Tampa. 
  Now? 
  Eske l konnen w ap vini? 
  Tanpri! 
  I'm his mother. 
  I don't need to announce when He ran halfway around the world to get away from your nonsense. 
  Evita! 
  It's true. 
  He'll be home in four weeks, Glory. 
  What do you have to say that you can't say on the phone? 
  I'm not saying anything.

  I'm sorry? 
  I You waited on me at that fish place, and I I owe you a tip, so Oh, it's okay. 
  Here, please. 
  I insist. 
  You'd be doing me a favor. 
  I I could tell myself what a good guy I am. 
  Sure. 
  Thank you. 
  Thank you. 
  - So, anyone strike it rich yet? 
  - Hmm? 
  Uh, black gold? 
  From the jar? 
  Oh, no. 
  Not yet. 
  (CHUCKLES) 
  Oh. 
  Well, there was only a couple cards in there anyway, right? 
  I mean, who are these people? 
  Do you ever notice? 
  Uh, no. 
  It's just funny, 'cause Jesus, man. 
  Oh - What? 
  - Look, I'm sorry. 
  I just got back from Afghanistan, like, 72 hours ago, and clearly I've forgotten how to have a normal conversation sorry. 
  You were in the military? 
  I was. 
  Not anymore. 
  I'm more of a contractor now. 
  Well, welcome home. 
  Thanks. 
  I'm Hunter. 
  - It's nice to meet you. 
  - Heidi. 
  WALTER: Can I ask you a question? 
  I was just wondering if I took things too far the other day. 
  Too far? 
  With the bird? 
  I Oh, no, it was it wasn't I mean, it's fine. 
  Okay, 'cause you seemed like you were a little upset about I wasn't. 
  (PHONE RINGS) 
  Yes, it's Heidi. 
  (THUNDER RUMBLES) 
  Okay. 
  I'll be right there. 
  Um, can you just stay right here? 
  I need to check on something. 
  Yeah. 
  (SIGHS) 
  (DOOR OPENS, CLOSES) 
  REINA: Ma'am, this is protocol. 
  I didn't write these policies. 
  You need to fill out a form Seems to me like you don't have any idea. 
  Heidi, hi. 
  Um, we're having a little bit of an issue here. 
  What issue? 
  Explain it to me. 
  This is Walter's mom. 
  (THUNDER RUMBLES) 
  Wow. 
  Yes. 
  Hi. 
  I'm Heidi Bergman. 
  REINA: I told her that we can't have unscheduled visitors, but she doesn't seem to think that I know what I'm doing. 
  You're in charge? 
  You work for Geist? 
  They're the ones that run this place, right? 
  Is everything all right? 
  If there's been some kind of emergency, we can Oh, there's no emergency. 
  He's my son. 
  I want to see him. 
  You're telling me that's not allowed? 
  Why would that be? 
  Well, the purpose of this facility is to ease Walter's transition, and he's been doing great. 
  It's just that visitors, especially family, can be I drove here from Georgia. 
  I have 28 papers to grade and nowhere to be. 
  Should I call security? 
  No, no, let's, um REINA: Heidi, all visitor requests have to be approved ahead of time. 
  Well, she's here now, and she's not going anywhere. 
  It's fine. 
  Mrs. 
  Morisseau, why don't you come with me, please? 
  (WHISPERING): It's fine. 
  Right this way. 
  What was that all about? 
  You live in Valdosta, right? 
  How long was the drive? 
  It should've been three hours. 
  Traffic? 
  No. 
  I didn't have the address. 
  How did you find us? 
  Walter said an office park outside Tampa, near a swamp and a retirement community. 
  - Must be a dozen of those. 
  - Only eight. 
  - So you just - This was number six. 
  Mom? 
  Mom, what did you what are you doing here? 
  I just wanted to see you. 
  Why don't we all sit down and talk? 
  Walter Tanpri, f¨ fanm sa ale. 
  Got it. 
  Mmm. 
  Heidi, I'm sorry. 
  I haven't seen my mom in a while, so do you mind giving us a second? 
  Sure. 
  Of course. 
  (MUFFLED RAIN CONTINUES FALLING OUTSIDE) 
  So, a month ago, I'm about a hundred miles outside of Kandahar, in the middle of nowhere, and she calls, says she wants a divorce. 
  - Wow. 
  - Right? 
  Said the whole thing was too hard on her. 
  Too hard on her. 
  - That's pretty rough. 
  - (LAUGHS) 
  Well, look, I I didn't even get mad, really. 
  I I it was more like f*ck this? 
  Yes, exactly. 
  f*ck this. 
  Well, look, I I I'd be gone so much I I couldn't even remember how to talk to her anymore, you know, or even how to be, really. 
  Maybe she maybe she just did what I was afraid to do. 
  I'm having, like, a breakthrough here. 
  - (CHUCKLES) 
  - Sure you're not a couples counselor on the side? 
  Only on weekends. 
  Oh. 
  (COLIN SIGHS) 
  It's after 1:00. 
  I'm starving. 
  HEIDI: There's a Chinese place next door. 
  Well, how about you? 
  You hungry? 
  I'm sorry. 
  You know, it feels really good to talk about this stuff. 
  I don't, I don't really get that many chances. 
  I I'm sorry. 
  Sure. 
  I could eat. 
  So, you know, I after my last tour, I came home, you know, tried to get back into things, relationships, work, but it just I didn't fit, you know? 
  So I went back. 
  There's a lot of us over there, ex-soldiers working as contractors. 
  We know our way around. 
  You like it? 
  It's all right. 
  - Kind of lonely. 
  - I bet. 
  Way out there. 
  Country's beautiful. 
  It's not that. 
  (STAMMERS) 
  You know, I'm surrounded by these government people and you just have to watch everything you say. 
  The truth is the last thing you want to tell them. 
  Why? 
  Because they'll use it against you. 
  Oh, they act like they're just doing their job, but their job is to find someone to blame. 
  I'm making it sound like No. 
  I know what you mean. 
  You do? 
  Yeah. 
  Someone using you like that? 
  What? 
  You know, hassling you, trying to get something from you? 
  No. 
  Because you were just saying (CHUCKLES) 
  I was just being polite. 
  - Doing it again. 
  - What? 
  - Interrogation mode. 
  - What is that? 
  Mm, nothing. 
  Just my work, you know. 
  Getting information from people. 
  I just slip into it sometimes without realizing. 
  Sorry. 
  Well, I got nothing for you. 
  Whining about my divorce and now I'm grilling you. 
  Jesus, man, it's a first f*cking date. 
  A first what? 
  And on that note, I think it's time to order my first drink. 
  I should probably What? 
  What do you mean? 
  It's (STAMMERS) 
  That's bad luck, you know. 
  What is? 
  - Folding laundry while sober. 
  - (CHUCKLES) 
  - That is one thing my mother taught me. 
  - Oh, really? 
  It's the only thing, really. 
  Look at me. 
  (LAUGHS) 
  So very much in love With you. 
  You gonna tell me what this is about? 
  (SIGHS) 
  She doesn't have any pictures. 
  No family, no nothing. 
  You need to be smarter. 
  You need to think. 
  - Think about what? 
  - Sa w ap f¨ la? 
  E fanm sa, Heidi Bergman? 
  What does she want? 
  She wants to help. 
  That's her job. 
  She supposed to be some kind of doctor? 
  Where did she go to school? 
  What does that have to do with anything? 
  Ou pa konn anyen. 
  You just believe. 
  But this government doesn't give away nothing for free. 
  There's a reason you are here. 
  Yes, there's a reason. 
  It's for treatment. 
  Treatment? 
  Pou kisa? 
  There's nothing wrong with you. 
  Nothing's wrong. 
  I just need to be here. 
  They want you to think that there's something wrong, that you need them, but you don't need some therapist making you talk about what you saw, what you did. 
  Look, no one's making me do anything. 
  You don't know that, Walter. 
  Kisa w te w¨ lot bo a? 
  If you made a mistake, - if they tricked you somehow - Tricked? 
  I know the terrible things that go on over there. 
  But you think the generals and their sons are going to take the blame? 
  No. 
  Mom, where do you get this sh1t? 
  Watch your mouth, Walter. 
  So what? 
  What's the point of all this? 
  They just bring us here to work on our problems? 
  That's all part of their evil plan, huh? 
  Yes. 
  They bring you here and you say, "I'm crazy, I'm violent," and you show them your weakness and then they take advantage of it. 
  This is exactly how it was when I enlisted. 
  - I'm not talking about that. 
  - Yeah, well, I am. 
  You said you wanted to serve, ou te f¨. 
  You're not serving anybody here. 
  You're being used. 
  And you're just afraid. 
  Ou gen rezon, I am afraid. 
  I just want you to come home. 
  (QUIETLY): He's packing. 
  Craig, just go back to your desk. 
  We should call security. 
  No, it's not necessary. 
  He's had a week four dosage, Heidi. 
  If he quits his meds at this point, - he's going to go into withdrawal. 
  - I know. 
  I know. 
  Okay, I need to inform Colin. 
  - I'm sorry. 
  - No. 
  What do you mean, "no"? 
  Heidi Have you lost your grip on what it is we're Craig, I haven't lost a f*cking thing. 
  Now shut your wet little mouth, turn around and go back to your toys. 
  (KNOCKS ON DOOR) 
 
 
 
  Hey. 
  Walter, what's going on? 
  I gotta go back with her. 
  She's having a tough time, basically, so All right. 
  Look, I'm sorry I have to leave in the middle of all this. 
  I'll get back as soon as I can. 
  Well, if it's what you feel you need to do, I of course I understand. 
  Just, is it what you really want? 
  She's my mom. 
  She's upset. 
  It's simpler this way. 
  Okay. 
  Can you answer my question, though? 
  What do I want? 
  Yes. 
  You talk about what you owe the people in your life or how you failed them, like Shrier or Lesky, but what do you want? 
  I don't think that's a good way of deciding. 
  Why? 
  Because if I stayed, it might be so I can focus on getting better. 
  I think that's really important. 
  But it might be so I can be with you. 
  You ever think about that? 
  I just think for you to leave treatment at this time could be dangerous. 
  - Dangerous? 
  - I Not No, not dangerous, just a little risky to To what? 
  I just don't think you should leave if you're not sure you're ready. 
  Right. 
  But can you answer my question? 
  I do. 
  What? 
  Think about that. 
  AUTOMATED VOICE: Please leave a message for COLIN: Colin Belfast. 
  - (MESSAGE BEEPS) 
  - Hi, Colin, it's Heidi. 
  I just wanted to let you know we had an unexpected visitor here today. 
  But I managed the situation and everything is is fine. 
  Okay. 
  - (DOOR CLOSES) 
  - WALTER: Heidi? 
  Walter, I just Mrs. 
  Morisseau. 
  You got what you wanted, didn't you? 
  Gloria. 
  I'm sorry, I just It's important to me. 
  Maybe if I explained more about our approach I understand that, dealing with the government and the military, you don't always feel like your son's best interests are a priority. 
  - They're not. 
  - (EXHALES) 
  I understand why you feel that way, but my only intention here is to help Walter. 
  - If you could just trust me - Trust? 
  I shouldn't worry about what the military is doing with my son because you, Heidi Bergman, feel that your intentions are good. 
  Well, Walter chose to stay. 
  It's what he wants. 
  I think you should try to respect that. 
  What he wants? 
  That hasn't mattered since the day he enlisted. 
  Well, he's done with that. 
  It's different here. 
  It's no different, this place. 
  Maybe you know that, or maybe you've convinced yourself you're serving a greater good. 
  Maybe you care about Walter's treatment. 
  Or maybe you just care about him. 
  It doesn't matter. 
  If you think that you can protect him, or anyone else, in a place like this, then you're a fool. 
  (CAR DOOR OPENS, CLOSES) 
  (ENGINE STARTS) 
  (INSECTS TRILLING) 
  (LAUGHING) 
  So we have, um, one drink - Yeah. 
  - after four years and he calls me the next day. 
  Unbelievable. 
  - Thank you. 
  - (BOTH CHUCKLE) 
  Uh, he said, uh God, what did he say? 
  He said, "Oh, it's the weirdest coincidence" and, uh, he's in my town and wants to know if he could stay at my place. 
  - No. 
  - But just for a couple of days. 
  - No, no. 
  - (LAUGHS) 
  What did he mean? 
  What did you do? 
  Um, I said, uh, "Anthony, I'm I'm really sorry, but my mom won't let me have sleepovers. 
  " (LAUGHS) 
  Which is true. 
  - (PHONE BUZZING) 
  - But wasn't very nice. 
  Yeah. 
  Anthony deserved it. 
  - Yeah. 
  - (CHUCKLES) 
  (EXHALES) 
  Is everything all right? 
  Yeah, it's my wife. 
  My ex, sorry, my ex-wife. 
  Wants me to sign the divorce papers. 
  Every time we talk, I make up another excuse. 
  (CHUCKLES) 
  She thinks I'm still in Afghanistan. 
  (COLIN CHUCKLES) 
  Do you ever get sick of it? 
  What? 
  Just lying like that? 
  Well, no. 
  I mean, uh - I - I mean, d Don't worry, I'm I'm a liar, too. 
  - You? 
  - Mm. 
  What what do you lie about? 
  Just every day, I I go to work, I pretend to be this this person, this waitress. 
  I serve people and I smile, and then I go home, and it's the same thing. 
  I pretend to be a a good daughter, and sometimes I convince myself this is me, this is real. 
  I know what you mean. 
  Oh, but then I like, I'll be in my car, or right when I wake up, and it's like I just appeared out of nowhere. 
  I can just see my whole life. 
  It's phony and fake. 
  And every word that I say, every second I don't know, but if it's that is a lie, then where's the other one, the real one? 
  The real what? 
  Me. 
  The The one I won't let myself see. 
  Hmm. 
  But then I start to think, what difference does it make? 
  If we lie? 
  If we lie or tell the truth, or if it's real or fake or just I just want to take it all and just put it in one place and just say f*ck this? 
  Yes. 
  Exactly. 
  f*ck this. 
  Um That's not what you meant, is it? 
  HEIDI: No, it isn't. 
  Okay. 
  MAN (RECORDING): Hello. 
  You have reached the Department of Defense complaint hotline. 
  Please begin after the beep. 
  (BEEPS) 
  GLORIA: Hello, yes, I do have a complaint. 
  This is I was just now at the Homecoming building. 
  In fact, I can say this. 
  I work there at the facility. 
  I am on the staff. 
  And I have seen something. 
  One of the soldiers, Walter Cruz, he wants to leave, he wants to go home, but they won't let him. 
  It's against He's being held here, and so he needs to be sent home right away. 
  Or or I don't know what will happen. 
  (TRAFFIC PASSING OUTSIDE) 
  (COLIN INHALES DEEPLY) 
  - Hi. 
  - Hi. 
  I'm tired of it. 
  Of what? 
  Lying. 
  Okay. 
  I think I did something something wrong, and I don't know what it is. 
  Okay. 
  Let's figure it out.
