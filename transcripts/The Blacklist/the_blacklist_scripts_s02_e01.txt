 [Both cheering] 
 [Indistinct conversations] 
 [Chuckling] Oh, my stars. 
 Is that how you cope with this insufferable humidity? 
 I couldn't do it. 
 We had an agreement. 
 We did. 
 I told you if I ever found you in my territory again, I'd kill you. 
 Tell the boy not to pull on the brim of the hat. 
 What's in the box? 
 I've come to propose a business transaction. 
 No, we have no business. 
 The box. 
 [Men shouting in Bantu] 
 Typically, I steer clear of tin-pot dictators who employ boy soldiers, but I'm afraid this situation is unique. 
 [Speaking Bantu] 
 Well, now you're being shortsighted. 
 [Speaking Bantu] 
 Tell him to put the gun down. 
 [Shouting in Bantu] 
 [Gunshot] 
 I'm glad to know you're a man of decisive action. 
 You see, Yaabari, you didn't actually find me. 
 I found you. And while your prepubescent ruffians may not know it, they brought me here to strike a deal that could benefit all of us. What kind of deal? A man calling himself Berlin hired a bounty hunter to find me and my associates. That bounty worked for you. I've since dispatched of him,  but if Berlin hired one bounty hunter, he hired five. I want their names. I'm willing to pay $3 million. We do need to move quickly, though. You have... 30 seconds. Yaabari: Or what? Or you give me the names for free. [Laughs] We really should act swiftly. We really should kill you and keep your money. Now, there's a point of view that I can relate to. [Laughs] Yaabari, look at me. Give me what I want, or so help me God, I'll make it rain fire on you. Kill him. [Whooshing] [Indistinct shouting] Funny thing... I recently acquired three hellfire missiles at a considerable discount. If you give me what I want, I can still call off the other two. But I'll need to borrow your phone. I know nothing. Mm. I think you do, Yaabari. I think you've heard things. Who else has Berlin hired to hunt me? The Cuban. Orci. I've dealt with Orci. Who else? I told you I don't know! [Whooshing] Okay. It's okay. There was someone. I-I can't remember his name. They call him something... the... The Prince, The Lord. Lord Baltimore. [ZZ Top's "La Grange" plays] Fetch the water! What are you doing? Go, go! 02x01 - Lord Baltimore He burned it? Are you kidding me? $3 million? We understand he has a lead. Reddington has had lots of "leads" in the past two months... humint that was supposed to help us in our search for this... We still don't even know what this Berlin's real name is. One thing we do know is that the FBI has allowed its #4 to hand out $12 million in untraceable black-bag cash to his friends. Martin: That money was used for local intel, and I'm confident that Redding... That money has people on the intelligence committee asking questions. The actions that concern you were approved by my predecessor. Now, I don't want to criticize Harold Cooper, and God knows I wish him a speedy recovery, but as Interim Director of this task force, I can assure you the situation is under control. I am the Deputy Attorney General. If I say I want to talk to Reddington, I talk to Reddington. Ressler: That's great, but we have a thing here... Reddington only talks with Elizabeth Keen.

Life is far too important a thing ever to talk seriously about. Martin won't protect the task force. He doesn't care that Berlin is still targeting us. And without Cooper to defend our actions... People love to decry big brother... the NSA, the government listening in on their most private lives, yet they all willingly go online  and hand over the most intimate details of those lives to big data. Most people don't care that Google knows their search history. They know more than that. They know your habits, the banks you use, the pills you pop, the men or women you sleep with. Every piece of information is worth something to somebody. And in the hands of the wrong person, that could be deadly. You have a lead. Lord Baltimore is in town. Lord Baltimore? He's a tracker by trade, but his methods are thoroughly modern. He's made an art of combing through cyberspace, finding the status updates, financial records, and location blips that virtually everyone leaves behind in the modern age. And he has a new target? Yes. Me. Follow this, Lizzy. It's our first lead. If we find Lord Baltimore, he may very well point us to Berlin. Berlin has hired a skip tracer who calls himself Lord Baltimore. Two months, and Reddington brings you a bounty hunter? He's more than a bounty hunter. He's a statistician. Martin: Even less impressive. What does he do, find them with a slide ruler? Aram: No. With data analytics. You've heard of this guy? Yeah. Lord Baltimore is an urban legend. They say he roams the deep web, hunting those who don't wish to be found... uses some sort of collection algorithms to build a dossier based on the information that people give away online. He's a data miner. Aram, can you pull up that file you showed me? Rowan Mills. She works as a data engineer at Quancord Analytics. Agent Keen asked me to look for any irregularities in the accounts of employees at the six big data firms. I found several, but this was especially odd... a $250,000 payment that went into Mills' I.R.A. 30 seconds later, it shot out to an offshore account. Yes, $250,000 was deposited into my I.R.A., but as soon as I saw that, I changed my passwords and I reported it. I'm telling you, I'm the victim here. Liz: And you said this wasn't the first time you were targeted? There was an incident in August. What kind of an incident? Someone accessed my systems. Looking for what? Bank accounts? Credit-card numbers? It would be impossible to know what they were looking for because the data we gather has no limits. They were looking for someone who doesn't want to be found. Could the data that was taken help them do that? Yes. That's what we do. Did you hear what she said? You're being paranoid. How easy it is to track someone? I mean, I just feel like... I don't know... someone is watching me. Is that why you're living out of your trunk? Those motels? The aliases? You got to stop doing that, Keen. Tom's dead. You talk to Dr. Friedman yet? Don't change the subject. The visits are mandatory. Look, the Bureau isn't interested in our mental health. They've assigned a shrink to talk to us to cover their asses in case one of us wigs out, but that ain't gonna be me. You're too healthy to talk to a shrink? I talk to you all the time. Aren't you board certified? Yeah. And in my professional opinion, I think you need to talk to Dr. Friedman. He here? Lord Baltimore has found Reddington. The extraction will take place tomorrow. But the Feds are involved now. That complicates things. There will be additional expenses. [Muttering] What? Aah! [Gurgling] [Gasping] I said no additional expenses. You deliver Reddington to me within 24 hours, or we take another bath. [Cellphone chimes] You have one new message. [Computerized voice] Hello, Rowan. I know about that little chat you had today with the FBI. So, I'm going to make this real simple for you. I'm warning you, do not talk to them again. I know where you live. This person calls you by name. [Sighs] I don't know. It could be anyone. It's as if they know you, though. What about the apartment? Any reason to believe there might be something missing, out of place? You think someone's been in here? [Cellphone vibrates] Hey, perfect timing. I'm gonna need you to trace a call. Aram: Okay. Great. But I have something. Our suspect, Mills, she's telling the truth. Security at Quancord analytics confirm her terminal was hacked from the outside. Any idea what was taken? Uh, yeah, like, a gajillion bytes of online data, which makes no sense. Why? Because Mr. Reddington's a luddite... No e-mail, no computer, no digital communication of any kind. I mean, Dembe uses disposable flip phones for God's sakes. Why would Berlin hire Lord Baltimore to track him? Unless... You think they might be looking for one of us? Not a day goes by where I don't think about Agent Malik. Me too. What number do you need me to trace? Rowan Mills received a message last night. I need a location. [Tires screech] Agent: FBI! [Indistinct shouting] Ressler. Let's get Mills in here. I want to see how she reacts to this. [Sighs] What is this place? This way. [Police radio chatter] So, what aren't you telling us? [Sighs] Nothing. Your name is on the lease. We know you were using the screen handle Lord Baltimore. Who? The same data that was hacked from your work terminal is on the laptop we found here. You stealing data for Berlin to find Raymond Reddington? I don't know any Raymond Reddington. I have never set foot in this place before in my life. Hello, Harold. Please apologize to Charlene... your side gate may need a new lock. A get-well present. It looks so soft. Shea butter? Cooper: Is this what I think it is? When are you coming back to work? I'm not. Things are at a tipping point, Harold. Your replacement has the unfortunate distinction of being both untrustworthy and incompetent. I've informed the Bureau. It's time to be with my family. Charlene's from the Dominican. I've always promised we'd spend more time there. I hate sand. If this is some kind of threat... It's not a threat, Harold. It's a bribe. That is my only copy of our... Little adventure in Kuwait. I'm giving it to you only to underscore the urgency of our situation. I'm not coming back. You need to get back on your feet. There's no shame in being a cripple. I'll remember you to Charlene. I know what they found while you were at the hospital. I know about the diagnosis. Let's get the job done. I mean, you got to do better than that. It's the only possible explanation. Liz: And this Nora... She died? In Mosul, seven years ago. But if what you're saying is true, if all of this is real, then it's the only explanation... My twin sister is alive. Concierge: It's nice to have you back, Mr. Howe. Your rib eye is on its way to your room along with a complimentary bottle of '82 Margaux. Thank you, Steven. Are you sure you want to take the stairs? Doctor's orders. We'll be fine. I don't remember him. Find out who he is and put two more men on detail downstairs. [Helicopter blades whirring] You hear that? [Indistinct shouting] [Screaming, gunshots] Man: Let's go! Take him to the roof. Lord Baltimore. Aren't you a surprisingly saucy minx. [Speaking Hebrew] Unbelievable. I'm sorry. Who is it exactly that you think I am? You're Mossad. Please don't tell me this is about that little dust-up in Haifa. That "dust-up" claimed the lives of two agents and a Turkish diplomat. [Laughs] A diplomat? I had nothing to do with it. Then you have nothing to worry about. Oh, you have no idea how I wish that were true. I have tens of thousands of things to worry about. Fortunately, you, my dear, are not one of them. And why is that? Because the person you just informed of my capture is going to release me within the hour. Aren't we confident today? I'm confident every day. And I thought we had nothing in common. I have no idea what that goes to. It was found in your apartment. I've told you I've never set foot in that place before. Let's talk about your sister. Lois: Now, this is Rowan, and Nora's on the left. Rowan was my first child by three minutes. Liz: How could you tell them apart? [Laughs] Rowan was a silly heart, always smiling. [Chuckles] She was a happy child. And Nora? She was complicated. Rowan: She was molested by our Uncle Rick from the time we were 7 until about 12 or so. I didn't believe her. Nobody did. Everybody just went on like nothing happened, everybody but... Nora. Nora had problems. She hated me, hated our mom. She hated everybody. After that, she was... lost, didn't fit in. I thought her getting that job with that company, that security firm, it really was the best thing she could do. Gossling: Nora. Ah, that girl, she was fearless. First one in, last one out. Hell, if half the boys on my crew had a pair like her, well, you could crown me king and take the afternoon off. Liz: She pressured you? How? She wanted me to use my position at work to try to get information on people at a competing security firm... Stuff that she could use to get the upper hand. And when you refused, she hit you? She flew out the next morning, and three weeks later, she was killed. Gossling: Her team was tasked with clearing hostiles out of a neighborhood in Ad-Dawr. Lead truck got taken out by an I.E.D., they came under heavy insurgent fire. We lost all four operatives that day. It says here her body was never recovered. That's true. She was taken. Taken? Well, they took her and did God knows what with that girl. So you never recovered her body? Uh, I don't believe she's still alive. But there is a chance she is. Rowan: But that's why you're releasing me, because you think she's still out there. Yes. But what if she comes after me? What if she comes after our mother? Rowan, we can't hold you. We have no probable cause. Red: Your younger brother, Shahin, was killed in the 2009 Pishin bombing. In Farsi, Shahin, means... Falcon. How did you know? I know everything about the people who are tasked with finding me. Your turn. How did you do it? You possess an affinity for Zegna ties. So do millions of other men. Thousands, actually... at least in the Northeast Corridor. Nonetheless, this sample was far too broad to be of any practical use. However, we couldn't help but notice that you lean toward a darker, earth-tone palate... chocolate and oxblood, geometric shapes, rarely stripes. We introduced a diblock copolymer nanoparticle marker into the brown dye in their factory in Novara, which supplies all the vendors on the Eastern seaboard. Effectively turning every earth-toned Zegna tie into a homing device. Brilliant. Just like a bloodhound. Dr. Friedman: Agent Ressler. [Sighs] Sorry, Dr. Friedman, but we're in the middle of an investigation. You do know I could suspend you pending assessment. We identified the key you found in Mills' apartment. The lab says it belongs to a van, a '77 G-series van. Tell Keen I went to pay the mother another visit. Agent Ressler. Aram: Hey, I got something! I got something. Okay, so, the collection algorithms that Lord Baltimore uses? Yeah. I applied them to the data he hacked, and, uh, I think I see how he does it. It's amazing. He's using personal details about his target's life to create markers to narrow his search. So he's looking for someone who lived in D.C. before 1990, has a prescription for Lipitor through Medco, downloads World War II documentaries on Netflix... not Amazon... and has a digital subscription to both the Wall Street Journal and Cat Fanatic. Reddington has a subscription to Cat Fanatic? No. Turns out Lord Baltimore's not looking for Mr. Reddington. Your suspect's been remanded into my custody. This references a task force. What task force? It's a matter of national security. Perhaps next time. Martin: Keen wants you to take a look at these. Ms. Navabi... Jundallah claimed responsibility for the bomb that killed your brother. They had nothing to do with it. Red: I can give you the name of the man who did. Walid Abu Sitta. Disappeared from his hotel room in Jiyeh last May. Police are baffled. Are they? Liz: What the hell is going on? Martin said you were extracted by Mossad. Red: We'll discuss it later. What am I looking at? Targets. Turns out Berlin didn't contract Lord Baltimore to find you. He's looking for a woman. What woman? We're not sure. We only know her profile. Aram was able to narrow the search, but that still leaves us with over 200 potential targets. Naomi Hyland. Who? W-who is Naomi Hyland? You need to get a unit to her right now. She's in protective custody. Wait. I don't understand. Uh, how do you know... Listen, Lizzy. Berlin is coming for this woman. You have to move now. Why? Who the hell is Naomi Hyland? She was my wife. [Laughter] I never said that. You said you don't believe in God. If you don't believe in God, then you're an atheist. You're an atheist. Well, you can be an atheist and believe in a higher power. For me, that higher power is shopping. [Laughter] Yeah, my credit-card bills prove that. You know what I believe in? Naomi. I'll drink to that. Oh. [Chuckles] Think we need more wine? Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Yes, please. Man: [Chuckles] [Sighs] 
 
 [Soft jazz music playing] [Metal clanks] [Indistinct conversation] Frank: Honey, what was the name of the lodge in the Alleghenies? You remember, the one with the fireplace and the moose head? [Laughter] Woman: [Gasps] What's going on? I'm sorry. What are you talking about? Agent: U.S. Marshals. Everyone stay calm. What is this? What are you doing in my house? Naomi! Mrs. Hyland, I need you to come with me now. We have a credible threat. He's back, isn't he? [Door opens] Hey, it's me. It's Marcus. You know why I'm here. Don't come any closer. I'm not here to hurt you. Just relax. I want you to hear this. [The Ink Spots' "We Three" plays] ♪ We three ♪

[Voice breaking] My daughter had a life with a house and a... dog. And then I woke up one day... You can't imagine what it's like to have a man like Raymond Reddington turn your life upside down. They accused me of being a part of it. Somehow, I was a suspect. Put my life under a-a microscope... every call, e-every charge. My assets were... [Sighs] I finally convinced them I was innocent. They said I had to go, give up everything. I remember it was a Wednesday afternoon. My daughter wasn't even out of school yet. And by Thursday, we were in Philadelphia, fending for ourselves. [Indistinct conversation] You need to talk to your wife. You're gonna have to tell him. [Silenced gunshot] [Silenced gunshot] We can be ready in 20 minutes. Okay, I'll let them know.

[Naomi crying loudly, panting] [Breathing heavily] Hello... Mrs. Reddington. [Breathing heavily] Where is she? I have already told you I don't know what you're talking about! You are Lord Baltimore. You were paid by a man who calls himself Berlin to extract Naomi Hyland. I need to know! Where was she taken? I'm gonna ask you again... Naomi Hyland? I don't know why you're talking to me. Nora put this together. A woman's life is in jeopardy here. I need Nora to tell me where she is. Then find her! Ask Nora! I am asking her! You're the expert, but from where I sit, this is the perfect setup... One personality hiding behind the other, able to commit a crime and yet have no memory of it. Well, that's not exactly how it works. Rowan passed the lie-detector test. That's because Rowan's unaware of Nora and Nora's unaware of Rowan. That's how dissociative identity disorder works. The two can't conspire. [Chuckles] Well, then we're screwed because we have Rowan and we need Nora. What we need to do is identify the trigger... the image, sound, memory that flips her switch. Of course. It's him. You were at her apartment. You're in her photos. What are you, some kind of handler? I'm nobody. [Grunts, inhales sharply] [Breathing heavily] She runs everything. With your help. You're manipulating her. You're looking at life in prison. Cooperate, and maybe we can make a deal. Tell me about her trigger. [Door opens] Liz: You know... I think you were right. I think Nora survived that incident in Mosul. I think she escaped, came home, and killed Rowan. What? [The Ink Spots' "We Three" plays] Th-That's impossible. Liz: Nora killed Rowan because she envied her. She wanted to become her. She wanted to be the good sister, the sister who didn't get abused by her uncle. You're lying. Nobody murdered Rowan! I'm Rowan! No, Rowan is dead. You murdered your sister, didn't you, Nora? That's what caused the split... the trauma and guilt of the murder. No, I... I'm Rowan Mills! ♪ We three ♪

A win's a win. Lord Baltimore's off the street. Did I hear right? Was Reddington detained by some, uh, Mossad agent? Yeah, apparently Martin had to negotiate his release. Well, any agent who can track down Reddington, I'm buying them a beer. [Knock on door] Congratulations. I heard you captured the man you were after. I thought maybe now we could [Sighs] go over a couple things, maybe take stock. [Sternly] Agent Ressler. I will recommend you for suspension. Look, I don't mean to be a prick here, but I'm not sure what you think you're gonna fix. Yeah, I'm not sure either... Until we talk. About what? Those agents who died today? About the fact that we lost a woman that we were supposed to protect? How do I feel about that? I feel like crap. But I know the good we do here, why it matters.
