 Mum died three years ago. 
  She had a double mastectomy, but never really recovered. 
  So why do you think your father suggested you come for counselling? 
  Because my mother died and he can't talk about it. 
  - Thanks, Dad. 
  - Get your hands off my miscarriage! 
  - I'm sorry for your loss. 
  - What? 
  - Your baby. 
  - Oh. 
  So, there is a particular person you're not having s*x with? 
  He's not available. 
  I believe God meant for me to love people as a father. 
  I'll go up to three. 
  No-one's asked me a question in 45 minutes So, what do you do? 
  You'll always be interesting with your quirky cafe and your dead best friend. 
  Celibacy is a lot less complicated than romantic relationships. 
  But what if you meet someone you like? 
  I talk and drink and laugh and give them Bibles and hope they eventually leave me alone. 
  What if you meet someone you love? 
  We're not going to have s*x. 
  I'd really like to be your friend, though. 
  I'd like to be your friend too. 
  What makes you a normal person? 
  Well, I don't believe in God I love it when he does that. 
  I don't know. 
  Just come out. 
  - I prefer the last one. 
  - Me too. 
  - It's a bit more subtle. 
  - Elegant, yeah. 
  - It's these bits, isn't it? 
  - Yep. 
  - Yep, last one, definitely. 
  - Yep. 
  Great. 
  - Really pleased with that! 
  - Yeah. 
  - Once it's nipped in there - Oh, it'll be perfect. 
  His arms. 
  - Do you prefer weddings or funerals? 
  - Weddings. 
  His arms. 
  I think there's something humbling about funerals. 
  Really? 
  Yeah, it's good to dwell on the next life. 
  You really think there's a next life? 
  What do you believe? 
  Worm food? 
  - Why?! 
  - Why what? 
  His neck. 
  Why would you believe in something awful when you could believe in something wonderful? 
  Don't make me an optimist, you will ruin my life. 
  - Have you been to many funerals? 
  - A couple. 
  His neck. 
  And you've never felt them go somewhere? 
  No, they were already gone. 
  His beautiful neck. 
  What? 
  What? 
  You just said, "His beautiful neck". 
  No, I said that they'd already gone. 
  Okay. 
  Weird. 
  Oh, right, so This might be your idea of hell but I think it's kind of special. 
  His beautiful neck. 
  Quaker meeting. 
  You're not allowed to speak. 
  If the Spirit moves you to speak, you have to stand up and share it with everyone. 
  It's very intense.

  I sometimes worry that I wouldn't be such a feminist if I had bigger tits. 
  [HE CHUCKLES] 
  - Well, it's good you felt something. 
  - Is it? 
  Something moved you. 
  I'm not sure I needed to me moved to discover that about myself. 
  What were you thinking? 
  I was thinking about how peaceful I felt and then for some reason, I was thinking about your tits, which kind of ruined it. 
  - Oh, my tits ruined your peace? 
  - Yeah. 
  You could say that. 
  [THEY LAUGH]

  Oh, um I just, um This is an excellent one. 
  I just thought it'd be a unique selling point. 
  Yeah. 
  Which came first, the guinea pig or the guinea pig cafe? 
  That is a big, old question. 
  Fair enough. 
  What do guinea pigs do? 
  They are born, they sh1t themselves with fear and then they die. 
  [HE LAUGHS]

  Don't, don't you That's my thing. 
  What were you praying about?

  Do you know there was a man who wanted to be a saint so badly he castrated himself just to stop himself?

  Here's to peace. 
  And those who get in the way of it. 
  I'm sorry about today. 
  Forget it. 
  Look at this. 
  Look at it. 
  That's the first one I ever got. 
  Went all the way to Rome for that. 
  Such a nerd! 
  Two years before I was even allowed to wear it, but I just I couldn't wait. 
  I couldn't wait! 
  I knew I wanted a bold, you know, this colour, but proper plum. 
  You can only get proper plum in Italy. 
  Sometimes I worry I'm only in it for the outfits. 
  So beautiful, isn't it? 
  I mean, your stuff is lovely, too. 
  What were you praying about? 
  You don't like answering questions, do you? 
  Okay. 
  Come with me. 
  I know what to do with you. 
  You go in there, I go in there. 
  And you make me tell you all my secrets so you can ultimately trap and control me? 
  - Yeah. 
  No. 
  - [LAUGHS] 
  You tell me what's weighing on your heart and I listen without judgment - and in complete confidence. 
  - Sounds dodgy! 
  I just listen. 
  At the very least it'll shut me up for a minute. 
  - I'm not Catholic. 
  - Tonight, that doesn't matter. 
  Won't I catch fire or something? 
  If you did, it would confirm my faith, so let's try it. 
  Go on. 
  Go on. 
  All right. 
  Okay, now you say, "Bless me father for I have sinned. 
  " - I'm not going to say that! 
  - Well, very good. 
  "It's been" Uh, enter days, years, months - "since my last confession. 
  " - Mm-hmm. 
  Then I say, "That's okay, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah", till you tell me what's on your mind. 
  Tell me your ssss - Sins. 
  - Sins, if you want. 
  [CHUCKLES] 
  - Why would I tell you my sins? 
  - Because it will make you feel better! 
  And because I want to know. 
  [THEY BOTH CHUCKLE] 
  Okay. 
  I lied. 
  Okay. 
  To you. 
  - About? 
  - About the miscarriage. 
  I was just covering for my sister who actually had the miscarriage, because her husband didn't know she was pregnant, and it just Okay. 
  Keep going. 
  And I've stolen things. 
  I've had a lot of s*x outside of marriage. 
  And once or twice inside someone else's. 
  And there's been a spot of sodomy. 
  Um, there's been much masturbation, a bit of violence, and of course the endless f*cking blasphemy. 
  [HE CHUCKLES] 
  And? 
  And - Go on. 
  - And I I can't It's okay, go on. 
  - Frightened. 
  - Of what? 
  Forgetting things. 
  People. 
  Forgetting people. 
  And I'm ashamed of not knowing what I What you want? 
  It's okay not to know what you want. 
  No, I know what I want. 
  I know exactly what I want right now. 
  What's that? 
  It's bad. 
  It's okay. 
  I want someone to tell me what to wear in the morning. 
  [HE LAUGHS] 
  Okay, well, I think there are people who can No, I want someone to tell me what to wear every morning. 
  I want someone to tell me what to eat, what to like, what to hate, what to rage about, what to listen to, what band to like, what to buy tickets for, what to joke about, what not to joke about. 
  I want someone to tell me what to believe in, who to vote for, and who to love, and how to tell them. 
  I just think I want someone to tell me how to live my life, Father, because so far I think I've been getting it wrong. 
  And I know that's why people want people like you in their lives. 
  Because you just tell them how to do it. 
  You just tell them what to do, and what they'll get out of the end of it. 
  Even though I don't believe your bullshit, and I know that scientifically nothing I do makes any difference in the end anyway, I'm still scared! 
  Why am I still scared?! 
  So just tell me what to do. 
  Just f*cking tell me what to do, Father! 
  Kneel. 
  What? 
  Kneel. 
  Just kneel.
