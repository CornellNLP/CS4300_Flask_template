 Shouldn't we wait for PJ to open this? 
  You should know first and be ready to help him with whatever the truth is. 
  Holding on to a secret - What are these? 
  - I have clinical depression. 
  is like holding a grenade. 
  - Jon left you money. 
  - We don't want it. 
  I don't want my son finding out that I've been lying to him his whole life. 
  At any moment - I applied to RISD. 
  - You did, sweetie? 
  Is there any way that you guys could help me out? 
  You know we don't have that kind of money. 
  your hand could slip I'm making the decision to be the best father I can be for Charlie. 
  That means being honest with both of my children. 
  people could get hurt. 
  Oh, my God! 
  I'm sorry. 
  I-I'm so stupid. 
  Are we okay? 
  I'm still trying to figure out who I am without cancer. 
  So maybe the answer I would be honored if you'd go on that cruise with me. 
  is to let the truth out. 
  Jon is PJ's father. 
  You know what? 
  Maybe PJ will be excited. 
  To learn his parents have been lying to him since the day he was born? 
  - Totally. 
  - I'm just saying, I'd be excited if I found out that my dad wasn't really my dad. 
  No, but seriously, what if he's not excited? 
  I don't know. 
  It's a lot. 
  Ugh. 
  Is that your dad texting you to pick up more stuff for the cruise? 
  The all-inclusive cruise? 
  Yes. 
  He wants thongs. 
  He better be talking about flip-flops. 
  You know, honestly, as worried as I am about PJ, I'm more worried about Delilah. 
  When she finds out he's Jon's son As if she doesn't have enough kids on her plate. 
  How do I tell her this? 
  Well, if she's gonna be okay hearing it from anyone, it's definitely gonna be you. 
  You know what? 
  How about you tell her while I tell PJ, then we'll meet back here later tonight for booze? 
  My dad wants me to pick up a prescription. 
  What for? 
  Oh, God! 
  That's gonna be one hell of a cruise. 
  - Oh! 
  - Oh, come on. 
  - Oh, that's - My God. 
  They are going crazy at the Garden. 
  What a comeback, people. 
  Down by 10 to tie it up. 
  - Next point wins. 
  - Alright. 
  Whoa, time-out, time-out. 
  This is a dress sock. 
  - Mm-hmm. 
  - While dressier, everyone knows they are far less aerodynamic. 
  Oh, he's already starting with the excuses, people. 
  The true sign of a sore loser. 
  - Okay, fine. 
  - Ooh, the pressure's on. 
  He's feeling it. 
  Yeah. 
  There's a lot riding on this. 
  There's a dog walk with Colin, his manhood, and it's all rolled up in one dress sock. 
  - Jayson Tatum. 
  - Pfft. 
  - Oh, no! 
  - Oh! 
  - Oh, that's all basket! 
  - Please. 
  That's a win for a winner, which makes you a loser. 
  You're a lose-stress. 
  You've lost. 
  Colin, you're gonna have to do a number two with with number two. 
  Ha ha. 
  That's not even fair 'cause you have that mini Celtics hoop at your office. 
  - Well, that's - Clearly, you're playing all day. 
  This is sad to listen to. 
  It's even sadder if you don't get him out of here. 
  That's a poop twirl. 
  Oh, yeah. 
  Oh, boy. 
  - Hello? 
  - Oh, that's probably The Globe calling for a quote from the loser. 
  Just tell them that you didn't execute. 
  Uh, no. 
  That's amazing. 
  N Yes. 
  Yeah. 
  I'm still interested. 
  I'm very interested. 
  Uh, can you hold on one second? 
  Okay. 
  That That is a call from Oxford. 
  Oxford? 
  Oxford, Massachusetts? 
  No, the lesser known one, in England. 
  I applied for this teaching fellowship, uh, and I thought I had no chance of getting it, but it sounds like maybe I'm moving on to the next round. 
  I know that you are the sock basketball champion of the world, but can you please walk Colin? 
  Yeah. 
  Of course. 
  Take the call, Bloom. 
  Good luck. 
  Hi. 
  I'm so sorry. 
  - No, no, this is a good time. 
  - Come on, buddy. 
  - Yeah. 
  - Come on, Colin. 
  I-I did my dissertation on complicated bereavement back when I was in Chicago. 
  Alright, Theo, Mom's waiting. 
  Hurry up and brush your teeth Not just your front ones. 
  Hey, do you have time to pick up a new sleeping bag for him today? 
  What's wrong with his old one? 
  Apparently, he's blaming his failed sleepover attempt with Auggie on faulty equipment. 
  That's amazing. 
  I am supposed to watch Charlie today, but let me see how long Delilah needs me. 
  Oh. 
  Look at that. 
  She just texted. 
  Looks like her plans got canceled. 
  I can totally pick up the bag. 
  What? 
  N-Nothing. 
  It's just do you think her plans really got canceled? 
  Yeah. 
  Why? 
  Well, it's just ever since we told her we want to tell the kids the truth I don't know. 
  I just hope this isn't a move to keep you away from Charlie. 
  No. 
  I don't think D would do that. 
  Yeah, you're probably right. 
  Hey, T, stop homeschooling yourself and come downstairs. 
  - Mom, it's here! 
  - RISD? 
  Yeah. 
  Wow, the envelope is big. 
  That's usually a good sign, right? 
  Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on! 
  "The Rhode Island School of Design is pleased to inform you" I-I got in! 
  Oh, my God! 
  Oh, my God! 
  I'm so proud of you! 
  "After financial aid, your expected family contribution for the first semester is $14,580. 
  " Oh. 
  Oh, sweetie. 
  I know. 
  We can't afford it. 
  What's all the excitement? 
  - Nothing. 
  - Patrick. 
  Hey, Pop. 
  Got your pills. 
  Thanks for that. 
  Did you get my flip-flops? 
  Yes. 
  Both pairs. 
  Why do you need two of these? 
  - These are great. 
  Thanks, Pop. 
  - Mm-hmm. 
  Omar, what are you doing here? 
  - House-sitting. 
  - You mean freeloading? 
  Not freeloading. 
  He's getting paid. 
  He's getting Okay, great. 
  Well, maybe he can help you figure out your new phone. 
  I tried already. 
  Can't figure it out. 
  Oh, oh! 
  Let me see the phone, please. 
  That damn thing came with free headphones. 
  You get my voicemail to work, they're yours. 
  Actually, that's great, 'cause mine just broke. 
  Hey, these are great. 
  Hey, Pop, can I have these? 
  Just let your brother have them. 
  Can't he just buy his own with the money he's getting for house-sitting the house he grew up in? 
  Work, work, work How are my boys doing in here? 
  Hey, Ma. 
  Hey, Mom. 
  Thanks for picking up all the stuff for the cruise. 
  I can always count on you. 
  Thank you, Mom. 
  See you still rocking that captain's hat. 
  Well, just until I get my hair done later. 
  Regina was so sweet to make me an appointment. 
  Someone wants to look nice for the captain. 
  He has personally invited us to dinner. 
  - Sure. 
  But I am not wearing a tie. 
  - You are wearing a tie. 
  I laid out the nice red one on the bed. 
  It makes you look dapper. 
  What are these? 
  I didn't want the ones that separate the big toe. 
  I can't wear socks with these. 
  Walter, you can buy them on board. 
  Sure. 
  Give your captain friend more money. 
  You know, Mom, if he were to suddenly fall overboard, I'm sure we could convince the jury it was an accident. 
  I know he's a lot, but I wish you and your dad could find a way to get along. 
  Promise me you'll try. 
  - I'll try. 
  - Thank you. 
  So, I made those changes you wanted to the catering menu. 
  You want to just look and see if it's the layout you wanted? 
  Yeah. 
  But before we do that I really need to talk to you about something. 
  I'm sorry if I've been a little short with you. 
  It's just I've been feeling ganged-up on about all this Charlie stuff. 
  I hear that, but I don't understand why all of a sudden you would take Eddie and Katherine's side. 
  It's You're my best friend. 
  I know, D. 
  I don't want you to feel that way, but being a best friend doesn't always mean telling you what you want to hear. 
  Sometimes it's telling you what y-you need to hear. 
  Which is why this is really difficult. 
  Oh, God. 
  It's the salon. 
  I hope they didn't fry my mother-in-law's hair. 
  This is Regina. 
  Wow. 
  She droppin' now, 'cause we poppin' now Just take the headphones, man. 
  They're not that great. 
  It's not about the headphones, okay? 
  It's about Dad always taking your side. 
  It's like the bunk beds all over again. 
  Bu Oh Oh, my God! 
  It was 30 years ago! 
  Get over it! 
  Says the guy who got the top bunk. 
  If you hadn't have got the bottom bunk, you never would have hooked up with Tania Peterson. 
  She was a nerd but she was a nerd with boobs. 
  If I got anywhere with Tania, it's because Mom put those glow-in-the-dark stars over my bed. 
  So So Mom was pimping for you, but I'm the favorite. 
  Rome, you forgot my orthotics! 
  See? 
  You done ticked off Daddy. 
  Unbelievable. 
  Hey, what are you doing here? 
  Oh, no. 
  Did D not take the news well? 
  I-I didn't get a chance to tell her. 
  Yeah, I hadn't had a chance to talk to PJ, either, because I've been too busy disappointing my dad. 
  - Rome - I don't even know why I try getting along with him My old man is who he is 'cause nothing is ever gonna change that. 
  Baby, uh What's wrong? 
  Your mom died. 
  An aneurysm? 
  How is that possible? 
  The doctor saw her a month ago and said she was great. 
  For what it's worth, they said she went quickly, without any pain. 
  I can't believe this. 
  She was just here a few hours ago. 
  Should've seen how excited she was to go on that cruise, Gina. 
  It's so unfair. 
  She was the glue. 
  Uh she held us all together. 
  Especially Dad. 
  Who's gonna tell him? 
  I don't even know what to say. 
  I'll do it. 
  You sure? 
  The last thing Mom said before she walked out of that door was that she wanted me and Pop to get along. 
  That starts right now. 
  Thank you. 
  Dad? 
  Would you show your brother how to work the remote? 
  I don't want him erasing my shows while I'm gone. 
  Can you stop for a second? 
  I have something to tell you, Pop. 
  There's nothing you have to tell me. 
  I have to pack. 
  And to be honest, this suitcase you got us, not that great. 
  Can you please listen? 
  Mom She died, Pop. 
  I know. 
  I heard you all talking downstairs. 
  I don't understand. 
  If you If you heard us, then what what are you doing? 
  Packing. 
  It might sound crazy, but I promised your mother I would go on that cruise. 
  And I'm keeping my promise to her. 
  Oh, thank you so much for lending me the Bonnie Ray CD. 
  - She's amazing. 
  - I don't know who this "Bonnie Ray" is, but Bonnie Raitt is amazing. 
  I'm 16. 
  How am I supposed to know who all those old people are? 
  Okay. 
  Wow. 
  Next week's lesson, we're gonna start with some music history. 
  I'm not sure I'm gonna be here next week. 
  Actually, this might be my last lesson for a while 'cause Mom's thinking of taking me, Danny, and Charlie to France for the summer. 
  - France? 
  - Yeah. 
  Wow. 
  That's When did this happen? 
  Uh, this morning. 
  Yeah, she kind of sprung it on us, but she was up all night last night looking at airfares. 
  Hi, boy. 
  Hi, bud. 
  Phew. 
  How's, uh, jolly old England? 
  Heh. 
  I assume that was the Queen calling. 
  Oh, yeah. 
  That was, in fact, the Queen calling. 
  Uh, Her Majesty wanted me to be sure to tell you, "Whazzuuuupp. 
  " How 1997 of her. 
  Look, um I applied for this fellowship before I got sick. 
  Wow. 
  Mail to England is really slow. 
  I got accepted last time but then when I got my diagnosis, I deferred, and I contacted them a few weeks ago to see if there is any possibility that they would still consider me. 
  A few weeks ago? 
  Why didn't you say anything? 
  'Cause I didn't think there was any chance that they would say yes. 
  And they haven't yet. 
  But apparently someone dropped out, and a spot opened up, and they want to video-chat this week. 
  Alright. 
  Well, this is very exciting. 
  So, how long is this fellowship? 
  It's a year. 
  That's longer than we've known each other. 
  I mean, it's not really that long. 
  It's what, 12 months? 
  And with the holidays, r-really, December doesn't even count, and then there's spring break and Thanksgiving and Boxing Day, whatever that is. 
  Forgive me if I'm not quite ready to make jokes about this. 
  Hey, D, what's up? 
  His mom? 
  Soph, if you are here next week, we're gonna be learning a little Stevie Nicks, who, despite the name, is a woman. 
  Thanks. 
  Okay, so, this France thing doesn't seem great. 
  I mean, Charlie just started recognizing my voice, and I swear she smiles when she sees me now. 
  Who knows what she's gonna be doing by the end of the summer. 
  That's a long time to be away. 
  I'm sorry. 
  You're the last person I should be complaining to. 
  She's your daughter. 
  You have every right to be upset. 
  It's like I don't even have a say in Charlie's life. 
  Can she do that? 
  Well, yeah, she can, if If what? 
  I don't even know if I should ask this. 
  But to get a passport for a baby, you need to have a birth certificate. 
  Do you know if you're listed on Charlie's? 
  What do you mean he's still going? 
  He promised Mom he would go on that cruise. 
  Oh. 
  Well, what about the funeral? 
  He says he wants us to do it before he leaves. 
  Said Mom never wanted us to spend a lot of money on the service. 
  Um, the cruise is in a couple of days. 
  He wants us to put together a funeral before that? 
  Here's what I know. 
  Dad and I both made promises to Mom Promises I plan on keeping. 
  Then that's what we're gonna do. 
  Two days ago, when I kissed my mother goodbye, I never thought it'd be the last time I'd see her. 
  She had tuna fish breath. 
  It's true. 
  She loved her tuna fish. 
  But as sad as I am to say goodbye to you, there's nothing else I needed to say, and there's nothing else I needed to hear you say to me. 
  It's such a blessed place to be with someone. 
  Thank you for always looking out for me. 
  I love you, Mom. 
  And I miss you already. 
  I'm gonna wait in the car. 
  I'm sorry. 
  It was nice of him to come. 
  He wanted to be here for you. 
  - I have to tell him. 
  - Not today. 
  Today's about saying goodbye to your mother. 
  He'll understand. 
  That was really beautiful, man. 
  Except for the part where the minister was saying the final prayer and my dad's phone goes off. 
  The only thing louder than a ringtone is an old man trying to turn off a ringtone. 
  I love you, man. 
  Love you, bro. 
  She did. 
  She had a wonderful personality. 
  Was always so kind. 
  - You should dye your hair pink. 
  - I think that's important. 
  Hey. 
  Hey, guys. 
  Hi. 
  That was really beautiful, what you guys did up there. 
  Yeah, we couldn't let Rome do it on his own. 
  We would've been here all day. 
  Hmm. 
  Hey, can I talk to you for a sec? 
  Sure. 
  So, Sophie said something about you guys going to France. 
  Yeah, I was just thinking about it. 
  It might be fun for the kids to see where I grew up, meet some of my relatives, maybe brush up on their nonexistent French. 
  And this doesn't have anything to do with Katherine and I wanting to tell the kids the truth? 
  - Eddie, what - D, if you are going to take Charlie to France, don't you think you need to talk to me about that first? 
  I mean, you say you want me to be a part of her life, but you're not really acting like it. 
  How can you say that? 
  Of course I do. 
  That's why I ran her name by you first. 
  It's why I did that photo shoot to get you in her birth announcement. 
  Eddie, I'm doing everything I can. 
  And I appreciate it. 
  But let me ask you this. 
  Who is listed as the father on Charlie's birth certificate? 
  You know it's Jon. 
  Eddie, correct me if I'm wrong, but this was the plan we agreed to. 
  Yeah. 
  But I guess what I didn't plan on was feeling this way. 
  What's the holdup? 
  We're waiting on Gina. 
  And make sure gets the flowers and the pictures. 
  Hey. 
  About what you did back there Yeah? 
  I wish you would've told me you were gonna do all that shoveling. 
  I wouldn't have paid the guy to fill it in. 
  You're gonna get dirt all over your fancy, battery-powered car. 
  Gina, what's the holdup? 
  So, if Delilah took Charlie out of the country and decided not to come back, there's nothing I could do about it? 
  Well, not if you're not on the birth certificate. 
  But I just I can't imagine she'd do that. 
  I don't know, Eddie. 
  And I really hope it doesn't come to this. 
  I make a living standing up for people, and right now, that's you and Charlie. 
  You are amazing. 
  We're in this together. 
  Thank you for taking these. 
  Of course. 
  Between Walter and Omar it seems like your hands are full. 
  They're pretty full. 
  Where's Maggie? 
  She went ahead with Delilah. 
  That woman's bladder is as tiny as she is. 
  Does this thing unhook, or? 
  Why is your work stuff Oh, my God. 
  You were fired? 
  Gina! 
  Are we leaving, or do I need to put my shoes back on? 
  Ah, the culinary mystery that is the puff pastry. 
  What is it? 
  A puff? 
  A pastry? 
  You got one nipple, like me. 
  - Gary? 
  - Yes? 
  - Can I have those, please? 
  Please? 
  - Sure. 
  Thank you. 
  Thank you for all your help. 
  Of course. 
  Oh, um, can you drop me back at the apartment so I can do the interview, or do you need to check in at the office? 
  I'm all yours. 
  Mm. 
  Thank you. 
  Uh, why haven't you told Maggie? 
  Because my bosses weren't thrilled with how much time I took off this year. 
  I mean, did you tell them that you were busy saving someone's life? 
  Apparently they only care about the lives they insure. 
  Well, still you have to tell her. 
  I will. 
  The thing is, she applied for some fellowship at Oxford. 
  Yeah, that Oxford. 
  Anyway, it's a big opportunity for her, you know? 
  I don't want this to affect her decision. 
  So, please please don't say anything. 
  I don't know what I'm gonna do without her. 
  - Be right back. 
  - Yeah. 
  - Get over there. 
  - It's It's okay. 
  Hey, Rome, I really need to ask you a question, but I have to ask it way over there. 
  - Yes, absolutely. 
  - Oh. 
  Can Can you excuse me, Joyce? 
  - You okay? 
  - I'm better now. 
  Thank you. 
  Alright. 
  So, D, those are That tray's for the roof. 
  Oh, but on second thought, your dad may not be able to make it up the steps. 
  Jicama? 
  I don't think so. 
  Well, if you need me, I'll be on the roof for the rest of the night. 
  I'm sorry, D, what What were you saying? 
  No, I'm sorry. 
  I shouldn't be bothering you with any of this. 
  It's just Eddie got me upset at the cemetery, like I was keeping it from him. 
  He all but accused me of trying to run away. 
  Well, are you? 
  I-I mean, you said you were kind of feeling ganged-up on lately. 
  Makes sense that you want to get away. 
  That's That's all I'm saying. 
  Sorry to hear about you and Stasia. 
  You two seemed so good together. 
  Yeah, yeah. 
 
 
 
  You know, me too, man. 
  But, you know, it just went south, and not in a good way. 
  It's like all of a sudden, we just were on different pages. 
  It's like one of those couples on that design show. 
  - Ooh, which one? 
  - The good one. 
  The one with the twins. 
  There's always that couple who, like, can't decide what house they want to get together. 
  - Mm. 
  Mm-hmm. 
  - You know, and then, you know, one always wants the move-in ready The other wants a fixer-upper with a lot of work. 
  - E-E-Exactly. 
  - Yeah. 
  Yeah. 
  No idea what you two are talking about. 
  - It's fine. 
  - Yeah, it's a show, man. 
  - You gotta check it out. 
  - Yeah. 
  It's like at first, we wanted the same thing, but then it's just like we grew in different directions, you know? 
  Plus, she was into some real freaky stuff. 
  Mm. 
  I'm talking about s*x. 
  - Yeah. 
  - Yep. 
  Yep. 
  - We made that leap. 
  - Yeah. 
  Hey, do you know if those sandwiches are are turkey or ham? 
  Duh. 
  Uh, are the carrots any good? 
  They're carrots. 
  Okay, I-I feel like you're mad at me. 
  Are you mad at me? 
  Why would I be mad? 
  I-I-I don't know. 
  I just I just feel like you've been avoiding me all day. 
  Where? 
  The funeral? 
  Yeah, there's a lot going on right now. 
  Sophie, listen, I-I think you're amazing. 
  Please, just don't. 
  Look, I get it. 
  You told me you just want to be friends. 
  You don't have to keep telling me. 
  Sophie, it's Look, it's not what you think. 
  - I-I - Okay, look, I'm fine, alright? 
  Let's not make this a bigger deal than it is. 
  Hi, Soph. 
  Everything okay? 
  Yeah, I'm fine. 
  Did something happen with PJ? 
  It's nothing. 
  Okay, you know what? 
  You don't have to tell me. 
  I'm just gonna sit here until you do. 
  Mm, mm, mm, mm, mm, mm, mm. 
  Okay, okay, alright. 
  You're crushing me. 
  I tried to kiss him. 
  Yeah, that's how I got into that accident. 
  Oh. 
  Soph. 
  It's It's just that he backed away so fast, like I-I was the grossest thing in the world. 
  Come here. 
  I know I'm your mother, and I know that you think I'm biased, but trust me when I tell you that you're not the grossest thing in the world. 
  Not even top five. 
  Can we please just go to France already? 
  I believe this American Girl doll coat belongs to you. 
  After I get this one home, should I swing back, check on our man? 
  No, I got it. 
  I just wish I could flip a switch and make it better. 
  I know. 
  But all we do can is help him keep his head above water. 
  You guys have been amazing these last couple days. 
  Apparently before this, we were horrible friends. 
  Mm-hmm. 
  Yeah. 
  I love you. 
  Bye. 
  Okay. 
  I mean, those twins, they just have so much chemistry as brothers. 
  You can't write that. 
  I heard they don't even fight. 
  It's okay. 
  I-I got this. 
  I can't catch a break. 
  - Babe - I just need a minute. 
  Hey, um y-your mom's friend Joyce asked me to get her coat. 
  I'll be quick. 
  I should probably get back out there anyway. 
  You okay? 
  Yeah. 
  No. 
  I don't know. 
  I don't know if this is helpful, but when we were all out there and the minister was reading that prayer, the um, the "ashes to ashes, dust to dust" one, I was reminded of something I read once. 
  That nothing lasts forever, that people we love sometimes leave our lives, but what stays is how they forever changed us. 
  Are you quoting my screenplay to me? 
  Maybe. 
  I think it's time for your brother and me to go home. 
  Dad, everyone's still here. 
  Well, if you want, I can just get one of those share-riding things. 
  I'll take you home. 
  Want me to go with you? 
  I want you to go instead of me. 
  But I better do it. 
  Hey, man. 
  Thank you for being here. 
  It means a lot. 
  Just drink that water, son. 
  You'll feel better tomorrow. 
  Set your alarm. 
  You're gonna have to drive me in the morning. 
  Your brother's gonna need to sleep it off. 
  Hey, Pop, what were you doing with all this stuff? 
  I was trying to watch some old movies of your mother, but Omar couldn't get the projector to work. 
  It helps if you plug it in. 
  What is this? 
  I'm sure you've been talking to Eddie. 
  My husband? 
  Yes, I've been talking to him. 
  Then maybe you can tell me what's going on. 
  You really think that I would take Charlie away from him, that I would leave the country and never come back? 
  There are a lot of things you've done that I don't understand. 
  But what I do understand is how Eddie feels. 
  - Katherine - Is Eddie Charlie's father? 
  You know he is. 
  Then put it on record. 
  There's a form you and Eddie can both sign to correct the mistake you made on the birth certificate. 
  I'm sorry, but I can't do that. 
  Here's the thing. 
  The reason you're in your house is because I'm a good lawyer. 
  So trust me when I tell you you do not want to go up against me. 
  I know you're a good lawyer, Katherine. 
  I'm asking you to be a good person. 
  Is Rome okay? 
  Nope. 
  But I'm pretty sure this surprise I got for him will help fix that. 
  Why does Omar get everything? 
  It's not fair. 
  He had his choice, and he picked. 
  Rome, I know how much you wanted the top bunk. 
  I really appreciate you letting your little brother have it. 
  Mom, Dad! 
  It won't flush! 
  Coming. 
  I'm never buying that kid LEGOs again. 
  Hey, Rome, check this out. 
  Wow. 
  Beautiful, isn't it? 
  So many stars. 
  Not just stars, sweetheart. 
  They're constellations. 
  Constellations? 
  Omar didn't break the projector after all. 
  And when you draw a line between them like you're connecting dots It was you. 
  What? 
  The stars I looked up at every night. 
  I thought it was Mom who put those there. 
  We're your parents. 
  What difference does it make? 
  It makes a lot of difference. 
  It makes all the difference, Pop. 
  When we buried Mom today, I meant it when I said there was nothing more that she and I needed to say to each other. 
  But I can't say that about you and me, Pop. 
  We have so much crap that we still need to work through. 
  But seeing this, seeing how you showed up for me, it just makes me think, you know, maybe we can figure it out somehow. 
  But when I don't know that you're doing things for me, I can't help but think that you don't have my back. 
  That nurturing crap was always your mother's department. 
  And I guess with her gone there are a lot of things we're gonna have to figure out how to do. 
  I'm gonna need you, son. 
  Good. 
  'Cause I'm gonna need you, too, Pop. 
  Who knew the bottom bunk was so awesome? 
  I should finish packing. 
  our little secret. 
  You got it. 
  Good night, Romy. 
  You'll always be my sweet boy. 
  Good night, Mom. 
  - Hey, Gare? 
  - That's my name. 
  What is this? 
  It's totally professional, right? 
  You like it? 
  Or do you think it's too much? 
  We can lose the photo of Prince Harry. 
  I cannot believe you did this. 
  Oh, but wait. 
  There's more, folks. 
  I was gonna get you a powdered wig, but then, believe it or not, I had a better idea. 
  Oh, my. 
  It's a bob. 
  Nothing says Oxford like a bob. 
  That's what the lady at the wig store says. 
  I hope you like it 'cause all sales are final and you know Colin's not gonna wear that damn thing. 
  Wow. 
  I love it. 
  Well, when you first told me about the fellowship I acted like a real w*nk*r. 
  That means "jerk" in English. 
  - Yeah. 
  - I Googled it. 
  And then something Omar said actually got me to thinking. 
  Stasia and her weird s*x stuff? 
  At first, yes. 
  That's all I could think about. 
  No, that TV show that you two were talking about. 
  I mean, it makes sense. 
  I wanted us to grow in the same direction. 
  So, if you want to you want to go to Oxford, then I want you to go to Oxford. 
  Thank you. 
  This really means a lot to me. 
  Just promise me that you won't get behind the wheel over there. 
  You can barely handle the right side of the road. 
  Everyone leave? 
  Pretty much. 
  Delilah's bringing some things down from the roof. 
  I was hoping to talk to PJ. 
  I didn't even see him leave. 
  I'm sure you can talk to him tomorrow. 
  Right now, I'm worried about you. 
  I know you are. 
  I know everyone is. 
  I'm not gonna lie. 
  I haven't felt this low in a while. 
  But it's not the same as before, Gina. 
  You know, my mom just died. 
  I'm supposed to feel sad. 
  But I know that I'm gonna feel a little better tomorrow and a little better the day after that, and It's not the same. 
  It's different this time. 
  I know I'm gonna get through this. 
  We gonna get through this. 
  Mm. 
  - - Okay, T, get into your pajamas. 
  Dad's gonna read you a story. 
  Actually, T, I'm gonna read you a story tonight. 
  Ha ha ha. 
  These are the last of the platters from the roof. 
  I'm gonna go home, check in on Soph. 
  Yeah, is she okay? 
  She seemed upset. 
  Yeah, she and PJ just Young love. 
  They'll figure it out. 
  You've had a long day. 
  Don't worry about us. 
  Um I'll call you tomorrow. 
  Mm-hmm. 
  Give Rome a kiss. 
  Gina? 
  Should I have said something? 
  'Cause I-I'm a feeling a little guilty. 
  - What's wrong? 
  - The DNA test, it was under the bed. 
  It's gone. 
  Mitch. 
  What are you doing here? 
  Um, uh, my friend's mom died, and I Why are you here? 
  I'm looking for my son. 
  Have you seen Patrick? 
  PJ's Barbara Morgan's son? 
  Why didn't you tell me
