 Previously on "A Million Little Things"...   
 I can't to lie you. This is your baby.   
 Sophie and Danny and Theo... there's just...   
 It's too much.   
 - They would never... 
- I know.   
 The baby has to be Jon's.   
 Anybody at school that you like?   
 - There is this one person. 
- Who is she?   
 This new kid at school... Ella.    
 You ever want to tell me that Ella's a boy, I'm glad to hear that.    
 I spent so much time trying to figure out why you've done the things you've done, and I realized what I need to figure out is why don't I feel like I deserve more.    
 I can't be your therapist and your friend at the same time.    
 That's not how it works.    
 Okay, wait a minute. Please.    
 Do... Do you have any idea what it took for me to come here today?    
 I-I don't have the courage to talk to anyone else about it.    
 Please.    
 You wanted to enjoy every moment of life, right?    
 Here comes some life.

 It's "blood, like winter, freezes just like ice."

 Blood is not a season.

 Maybe you should call her and tell her that...    
 That she's a disgrace to your profession, that she's a con artist.

 She's like a depressing fortune cookie.    
 So call. Hey.    
 What are you waiting for?    
 You don't have a lot of time left.    
 Gee, thanks!    
 Hey, you're the one who's refusing treatment.    
 I'm just... I'm employing gallows humor.    
 Yeah, I would call, but I don't think it would be very dignified of me.    
 Dignified? What do you care about dignified?    
 Call her and tell her the truth.

 It's not that I don't like dogs. It's...     
 It's just that I don't like  his  dog.   
 - Like I said, kidding. 
-  Um, he climbs  in the bed with us. Bleh. 
- You guys have spooned.     
 -  Maybe you're mad at your boyfriend, Margaret. 
- Ooh, "boyfriend."     
 - Did you hear that? 
-  And you're taking it out on his dog.   
 Because that's what it is. 
That's what you call it.     
 "Boyfriend," that's great. Um, first of all, who said anything about a boyfriend?     
 How do you know that we're not just "the word you can't say on the radio" buddies?     
 Are you asking him to give up his dog for you?   
 My God, that is so glib.     
 You... Okay, you do not know anything about me or my friend or his dog.     
 What if I told you that my friend is blind?     
 Blind?     
 Is he?   
 - No. 
- [SNORTS]     
 Okay. Well, excuse me, but I don't think this is why you called.   
 Oh, great, okay, excellent.     
 Please, tell me, why did I call?     
 I'm saying this has nothing to do with the dog!   
 You're afraid to fully give yourself to this relationship.   
 - Ooh. 
- That's your professional opinion?     
 You could fit that in a fortune cookie, okay, lady? You know, y-you're telling me that it's my fault that...     
 That... that I have intimacy issues?
