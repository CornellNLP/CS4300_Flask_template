 If we live better lives, he wouldn't have died in vain? 
 Maybe. 
 Yes. Okay. 
 Well, I got news for you, Ed... That's not gonna happen. 
 'Cause we're not gonna live any differently. 
 You hate your stupid job... Your words... 
 But you won't quit because directing asinine pizza commercials pays way too much money. 
 You and your wife can't stand each other, but you'll never leave her... Not ever... 
 Because you're too afraid to take a chance on yourself. 
 People always say they're gonna live differently. 
 And you know what? We will... For exactly two weeks. 
 [CHUCKLES] And then we'll go right back to doing the same crap that we've always done. 
 I'm in love with someone. 
 ♪ ♪ 
 What? 
 She's a... the mom of one of my students. 
 We did not mean for it to happen. 
 But I love her, and she believes in me. 
 And I need to leave Katherine, but I just have to make sure everything's okay with Theo first. 
 And  I'm  in love with beer. 
 Mind if I go ahead of you guys? 
 - Sorry 'bout that. 
- It's all right, fellas. 
 GARY: Look, Ed, I'm thrilled that you are getting out of a marriage that is more toxic than anything that's ever been in my body, but it's your need to credit ending something that should've ended two years ago to our friend jumping off a concrete diving board. 
 Listen, it's not just that. 
 It's the fact I haven't had a drink in seven years because that same friend stepped onto an elevator... 
 Knock it off. Knock it off with the elevator crap, man. 
 What do you think I would've done if I hadn't met you guys? 
 Seriously. 
 I would've become friends with three other schmucks. 
 I mean, look around. There are Bruins fans all over the place. 
 Gary... how does a man who beat cancer not see that maybe there is a reason that things happen? 
 Let me be very clear. 
 First of all, God didn't cure my cancer. Science did. 
 Secondly, it's not that I don't have cancer, Ed. 
 It's that I don't have cancer right now. 
 The all-clear screening I got this week just gives me permission to hold my breath for another three months! 
 Hooray for me.

 Wait... this is it? 
 Yeah. Jon's last deal was for the old Griffin Street Bakery building?
