 I missed the first three months of Theo's life 'cause I was in rehab. 
  Now I'm here, and I know exactly what I'm missing. 
  EDDIE: When you screw up, you tell yourself you'll be better next time. 
  We decided Charlie was gonna be Jon's baby so things would be easier for the kids. 
  If only it were that simple. 
  When I told her about the baby, she left. 
  Mommy! 
  THEO: How was your trial? 
  Oh, I told him about your big case. 
  In the Grand Canyon. 
  We don't always get to choose. 
  We need to make this work. 
  Whatever you want me to do. 
  I lost my brother in a car accident. 
  Is he the reason you don't drive? 
  We're not in control. 
  Colin's home. 
  We can go back to normal. 
  Eddie found this at the dog shelter. 
  They've been looking for him since last year. 
  And the truth is hard to hear. 
  PJ's getting digits. 
  ROME: PJ's not just some random kid. 
  He might be Jon's son. 
  Next question what's the capital of Louisiana? 
  - New Orleans. 
  - [SIGHS] 
  is apparently not the answer. 
  Baton Rouge. 
  Dad, are you looking at the map on the place mats? 
  - Not anymore. 
  - [BOTH LAUGH] 
  Next question and no looking what is the capital of Texas? 
  - Austin. 
  - Austin. 
  Correct! 
  Love Austin. 
  Great walk-in closets. 
  What about Arizona? 
  Hmm, I've never been there before. 
  Is it Flagstaff? 
  Mom, you've been to Arizona. 
  You just went to the Grand Canyon for your trial, remember? 
  Yeah. 
  Um But we were on the Nevada side, where the courthouse is. 
  Okay, birthday boy. 
  Quality check. 
  - [GIGGLING] 
  - Yeah! 
  [CHUCKLES] 
  GARY: I don't know what to do. 
  I can't imagine giving Colin back. 
  He's my dog. 
  Whoa, whoa. 
  Little close on my side. 
  Oh, babe, don't swerve into the other lane. 
  I will stay in my lane if you stay in yours. 
  I'm just trying to help you pass this test. 
  When Colin got out, all I wanted was for someone to do the right thing and bring him back to me. 
  So how can I not do that for for this Bennett guy? 
  Look, whatever you decide, I know it'll be the right thing. 
  - And I feel terrible, because if I - [SIGHS] 
  Maggie, stop, stop, stop. 
  I'm serious. 
  There's a stop sign! 
  [TIRES SCREECH] 
  You were saying? 
  If Colin hadn't gotten out, you wouldn't have seen the flier. 
  I'm so sorry, Gary. 
  Two things. 
  This is not your fault. 
  And you are blocking the entire crosswalk. 
  This is not my usual height joke, but you can see above the dashboard, right? 
  Ha ha ha. 
  Mm-hmm. 
  - Sort of. 
  - Mm-hmm. 
  REGINA: I don't know how you're acting so normal. 
  I mean, D's gonna be here in less than 20 minutes, and we're keeping a huge secret from her. 
  Hey, we do not know if PJ is Jon's son. 
  And until we do, I am extremely normal. 
  Hey, Normal, what are you doing with that? 
  These are baby stitches waiting to happen. 
  Rome, you are only looking after Charlie for a few hours. 
  She can't even lift her head on her own. 
  And besides, didn't you ask Delilah to bring over a playpen in one of your 57 texts to her? 
  That woman has been MIA since I asked for the baby wipe warmer. 
  - [DOORBELL RINGS] 
  - Found her. 
  - Get the door. 
  I gotta wash my hands - I am. 
  for 20 seconds. 
  Oh. 
  H-Hi. 
  Look who's here. 
  Uncle Rome's coming 'round the mountain when he comes Hey, Uncle Rome. 
  [WATER SHUTS OFF] 
  Oh, PJ. 
  Man, I know you want to be here when we get the DNA results, but you can't keep showing up with coffee. 
  Um, that's why I also brought scones. 
  That's very sweet, but you have to write. 
  Write? 
  Right! 
  Yes, and and and you need to get to the - My friend's - gym. 
  She has a friend named Jim who owns a gym. 
  You know how it is. 
  You You are where you work. 
  You should get going. 
  Okay, we'll call you as soon as it comes in. 
  - Okay, thanks, guys. 
  - Yeah. 
  - But it was great seeing you, though. 
  - All right. 
  Okay. 
  Bye. 
  Right. 
  "Jim who owns a gym"? 
  You're a writer. 
  I panicked, okay? 
  - I-I didn't want him to run into - DELILAH: Oh, how nice of you. 
  Delilah. 
  - [KNOCK ON DOOR] 
  - Oh, God. 
  - Hey. 
  - Hey. 
  Your friend was nice enough to help me carry the playpen you wanted me to bring. 
  - Great. 
  - How lucky is that? 
  [SMOOCHES] 
  Hi. 
  Well, sometimes everything works out! 
  And then there's now. 
  PJ: Hi, there, Charlie. 
  I feel like we've met. 
  You just You look so familiar. 
  No, no, no, you haven't met. 
  You run in different circles. 
  PJ's the guy that found Gary's dog. 
  Ohh, you're the one who found Colin. 
  Gary loves you. 
  And he hates everyone. 
  - [LAUGHTER] 
  - [FORCED LAUGH] 
  Huh? 
  Uh, yeah, I was just leaving. 
  Aw, man, really? 
  Well, great to see you, Peej. 
  Okay. 
  Nice meeting you. 
  Let me walk you out. 
  Uh-oh. 
  We have a 10-pack of dinosaurs, but 11 kids are coming. 
  Fingers crossed for strep throat. 
  I hate lying to him, Eddie. 
  Especially today. 
  I know. 
  And I'm sorry. 
  You know, the last time I had to lie to people was before you got sober. 
  I feel like I'm doing the same thing all over again. 
  Only this time, it's to my son. 
  I know. 
  But this affects more than just Theo. 
  Yeah. 
  Which is exactly what I told Delilah. 
  Wait, what? 
  Katherine said that?! 
  Yes, she wants it out in the open. 
  She wants to tell the kids. 
  Really? 
  Sorry. 
  It was hard enough for us to try to understand everything that happened last year. 
  And now we're we're finally getting back to some kind of normalcy. 
  And Sophie's just getting her license today, and Danny's in the school play. 
  It's I don't think they could handle another grenade going off in their lives. 
  Not now. 
  What? 
  You guys think I'm doing the right thing, right? 
  D Totally. 
  Trust your gut, D. 
  You're the best mom I know. 
  It's just I-I'm going to have to see Katherine at Theo's birthday this afternoon. 
  I don I don't know what to say. 
  I probably shouldn't even be talking about this in front of Charlie, huh? 
  Well, if this baby can repeat anything you said, you got bigger problems, lady. 
  [LAUGHS] 
  You ain't no snitch. 
  [LAUGHTER] 
  The thing is, if we expect Theo to be truthful with us, how can we not be truthful with him? 
  I hear you. 
  And believe me, I don't like lying to him, either, but Delilah and I agreed. 
  That's the thing. 
  The two of you agreed. 
  But I had no say in any of it. 
  [SEAT BELT CLICKS] 
  Okay, let's get started. 
  [ENGINE STARTS] 
  [SIGHS] 
  [CHUCKLES NERVOUSLY] 
  That means you put your foot on the brake and shift into drive. 
  Yeah. 
  Yeah, I'm nailing the "foot on the brake" part. 
  [CHUCKLES] 
  Well, you don't even know if the family is still there, right? 
  They could have moved. 
  Maybe they even got another dog. 
  You're right. 
  They could be dead. 
  Well I mean, I hope they're not. 
  But they could be. 
  [BOTH CHUCKLE] 
  Was she nervous? 
  Not nearly as nervous as everyone outside the car. 
  [CHUCKLES] 
  Oh. 
  Any chance that is the world's best poker face? 
  Hi. 
  [SIGHS] 
  Aw, it's okay. 
  A lot of people fail that test the first time. 
  I didn't fail. 
  I didn't even take it. 
  Well, there's your problem. 
  I was sitting behind the wheel, about to start, but then I had a panic attack thinking about my brother, and I just Oh, you'll know when you're ready. 
  Besides, getting your license really isn't that big of a deal. 
  Yes! 
  I passed! 
  Best day of my life! 
  [LAUGHS] 
  Whoo! 
  Yes! 
  Ohh, honey. 
  In fairness, Sophie hasn't lived that much life. 
  [GASPS] 
  Let's see it. 
  Look at you. 
  We have to tell Delilah about PJ. 
  Were you not just sitting right here when she said that the last thing her family needs right now is for another grenade to go off? 
  And if PJ is Jon's son, that is not a grenade. 
  T-That's That's Hiroshima. 
  [CELLPHONE BUZZES] 
  Oh. 
  It's Gene. 
  He's probably calling about the Lexus commercial. 
  We're supposed to lock picture today. 
  He's probably calling to tell me it's perfect. 
  [CHUCKLES] 
  Hey. 
  Do they love it? 
  Uh-huh. 
  Uh-huh. 
  Uh-huh. 
  Uh-huh. 
  All right. 
  Okay, w-well well, other than that, do they love it? 
  Yeah, if you can give me, like, 20 minutes, I Yeah. 
  Hey, Gina, can you can you hold the baby? 
  - Yes. 
  - Yeah. 
  For like what, three hours? 
  What? 
  No! 
  I'm supposed to help Katherine bake a cake. 
  I can't take this baby there. 
  Talk about Hiroshima. 
  I can't take her to work. 
  So what are we gonna do? 
  [SIGHS] 
  Oh, thank goodness. 
  I am so glad you are here. 
  Great, harness that feeling, because there's been a little hiccup. 
  Is this gonna be a problem? 
  [SIGHS] 
  Of course not. 
  Come on in. 
  Hi, sweetie. 
  [CHARLIE COOING] 
  Okay. 
  [DOOR CLOSES] 
  [VEHICLE DOOR CLOSES] 
  Why is Danny out here? 
  Oh, I need you guys to help me move stuff out of the garage. 
  Okay. 
  What's going on? 
  Ta-da! 
  Oh, my God! 
  Oh! 
  Oh! 
  What? 
  Are you serious? 
  Are you serious?! 
  - [GASPS] 
  - She is, in fact, serious. 
  Oh! 
  Dad bought this car the year you were born, and he always wanted to give it to you the day you got your license. 
  He'd be so proud of you. 
  I just wish he were here. 
  He is. 
  Aww. 
  [LAUGHS] 
  Congratulations. 
  Feel free to drive me places. 
  Come here. 
  My baby girl's growing up so fast! 
  Okay, come on, Mom. 
  I'm not a little girl anymore. 
  I know. 
  All right, test-drive. 
  Okay. 
  - Wait. 
  What? 
  - Thanks, Mom! 
  - Wait. 
  What?! 
  You little devil. 
  - [GIGGLES] 
  Okay. 
  [LAUGHS] 
  [ENGINE STARTS] 
  Now be careful. 
  You ready? 
  [LAUGHS] 
  [GEARSHIFT CLICKS] 
  Bye! 
  Oh! 
  We're good. 
  [LAUGHS] 
  - Oh, my God. 
  - Check your mirrors. 
  You know what you're doing, right? 
  Don't go too far. 
  Or too fast! 
  - Got it! 
  - Oh, gosh. 
  - Here we go. 
  - Feed my goldfish! 
  Bye! 
  You know, Bryan, let's start wide on the GX like you have it - and then cut to the 3/4 shot that they want. 
  - [CELLPHONE BUZZES] 
  - [CELLPHONE BEEPS] 
  - What's up? 
  GARY: Small confession, I'm currently stalking an 80-year-old woman. 
  [CELLPHONE BEEPS] 
  What is happening? 
  I don't know whether or not I should give Colin back, so I thought, you know, I'll drive by, scope out his old home. 
  Gary, you can't You know what? 
  Actually, it's not a bad idea. 
  The oldest woman alive came out and got a paper, and now, uh, for the last 20 minutes, I've been watching her water what's left of her lawn. 
  N-Now you sound a little crazy. 
  I'm not crazy, man! 
  Just hear me out. 
  If she's terrible, Colin stays with me. 
  And if the old bag is a saint, well, then she gets her dog back, and I feel a little worse about calling her an old bag. 
  I'd go with option two. 
  You think I should give him back? 
  No, no, no, I'm talking to my editor. 
  Hey, go with the multi-terrain monitor shot instead. 
  You know, I'm not getting the undivided attention I was looking for here, man. 
  I'm just gonna talk to her. 
  Wish me luck. 
  Let's hope she's the devil. 
  She looks like a lost Golden Girl. 
  All right, keep me posted. 
  I can't believe it's been 10 years. 
  Maybe that's because Theo acts like he's 47. 
  [LAUGHS] 
  The day he was born was the best day of my life and the worst. 
  [THEO COOS] 
  EDDIE: I'm so sorry I wasn't here. 
  Jon and I have a plan. 
  Things are gonna be different. 
  Oh. 
  [THEO CRIES] 
  Katie, I promise you I won't ever drink again. 
  I don't believe you. 
  You three have come such a long way. 
  Yeah. 
  So, I guess you've heard about what's going on? 
  Yeah, Delilah told me. 
  Don't forget the vanilla. 
  Thanks. 
  And actually, Katherine, seeing you with Charlie it all seems fine. 
  So why say anything? 
  Do you have any idea what I've had to do to get to this point? 
  10 years ago, before Eddie got sober, there were so many lies. 
  And lies lead to drinking. 
  And I don't want to go back there. 
  I don't want Theo growing up with that, and I don't want Charlie to, either. 
  Yeah, I wasn't expecting this, either, D. 
  That's why I wanted to talk with you. 
  Okay, so how do we make her understand that the kids can't know? 
  Maybe we don't. 
  Maybe Katherine's right. 
  What are you saying? 
  Maybe we should tell the kids. 
  What What would we even say? 
  The truth? 
  You want me to tell my children that I slept with their father's best friend? 
  And then had a child with him? 
  I can't do that. 
  [SIGHS] 
  Wait a minute. 
  Hello? 
  Can I help you? 
  Hi. 
  Hi. 
  Um I'm going around doing a small survey. 
  Would you have time for a quick small survey? 
  - What's it for? 
  - It's, uh, for the Best Friends of all of Boston Foundation. 
  Don't you need a clipboard? 
  Usually, yes. 
  I can see you've done this kind of thing before. 
  But, uh, as luck would have it, I am now the area supervisor, and [CHUCKLES] 
  I can pretty much do these from memory now. 
  - That's very impressive. 
  - Thank you. 
  - Well, fire away. 
  - Right. 
  Well, uh, I should be doing this survey with, uh, a Bennett? 
  Oh, that's my husband. 
  Oh. 
  My late husband. 
  Oh. 
  He died right before the holidays. 
  - I'm very sorry to hear that. 
  - Thank you. 
  Uh, but it looks like you've got some companionship. 
  You got a dog. 
  Actually, no. 
  Wesley ran away eight months ago. 
  I guess I'm still holding out hope that Wesley will come back. 
  Bennett loved that dog so much. 
  In fact, the last thing he did was put out missing-dog posters. 
  Well, no, actually, the last thing he did was put up those Christmas lights. 
  After my hip surgery, I can't be on a ladder. 
  [CLEARS THROAT] 
  Well, I am, uh, sorry for all of your losses, Mrs - Enid. 
  - Enid. 
  - Thank you. 
  - I'm sorry, Enid. 
  What about the survey? 
  I got the answers I needed. 
  Okay. 
  So, Colin belongs to an old woman with a dead husband, dead grass, and dead Christmas lights? 
  No, Wesley does. 
  She had food laid out like she was waiting for him to come back. 
  [CHUCKLES] 
  That's rough. 
  EDDIE: Hey, if you want, we can switch. 
  That way, you can decide if you want to break your promise to Delilah or break your vows to Katherine. 
  - Pass. 
  - [LAUGHS] 
  But you know what? 
  Luckily, today isn't about us. 
  Today is about Theo. 
  Yes, your little man is becoming a little man. 
  Not for nothing, Ed, today is also about you. 
  Yeah, we're proud of you, dude. 
  You haven't had a drink in 10 years, man. 
  I almost did. 
  What? 
  When? 
  The night of Jon's funeral. 
  Hi, Daddy. 
  Oh, hey, bud! 
  I just wanted to get my hockey stick. 
  What are you doing? 
  EDDIE: Theo saved me. 
  Twice. 
  That night and the day he was born. 
  So, today is not about me. 
  It's about my son. 
  And it's gotta be perfect. 
  Well, then let's make it perfect. 
  And after the guests clear out, I'm gonna need to know why you own so many chairs. 
  He's gonna love it. 
  It's fantastic. 
  Thank you. 
  With five minutes to spare. 
  Oh, no. 
  Oh, perfect timing. 
  Oh, no. 
  Yeah, okay. 
  It's okay, sweetheart. 
  Gotta clean up the mess. 
  Yeah. 
  - I know. 
  - [CHARLIE CRIES] 
  Um, uh, let's see if this fits her. 
  Oh, where is that from? 
  I saw it at the baby store across from my office. 
  I thought it would look cute on her. 
  Who are you? 
  [SIGHS] 
  Someone who needs this to work. 
  Mom, you coming? 
  Yeah, be right there. 
  Are you wearing lipstick to a kid's birthday party? 
  I guess Mom can just drive you places. 
  'Cause I love it! 
  [KNOCK ON DOOR] 
  [UP-TEMPO MUSIC PLAYING] 
  Sophie, Danny, Delilah. 
  You made it! 
  - Uh-oh. 
  - Thanks so much for coming! 
  Thanks so much for having us! 
  Where's Charlie? 
  Upstairs. 
  Regina has the baby monitor. 
  So the theme of the party is awkward tension? 
  And waffles. 
  REGINA: Hey. 
  Oh, thank you. 
  Um, have you guys seen Gary? 
  Last I heard, he was stalking a senior citizen. 
  Yeah, that didn't go so well. 
  You know, maybe we should buy him a puppy or something, ease the blow? 
  Well, there was that mastiff we saw down at the Teplow Street Shelter when Colin got out. 
  He was basically his doppelganger. 
  Swapping one dog out for another is not gonna make him feel better. 
  But it might make us feel better. 
  If Gary gives Colin back, he's gonna have to go through the grieving process. 
  Ooh, it's gonna be a rough party. 
  This is going to be a great party. 
  For Theo. 
  Hi, there. 
  Fair warning, this is a communal bowl, so eat now or forever hold your piece. 
  I hope the parting gift is pump soap. 
  [LAUGHS] 
  I heard about the old lady. 
  Don't be jealous. 
  Oh, that old lady. 
  Mm-hmm. 
  [CHUCKLES] 
  Apparently she's really missing my dog. 
  So, there's that. 
  Gary, I'm sorry. 
  Nope, no, no, no, no, no. 
  Today Today is all about Theo. 
  And if you'll excuse me, I think I see a birthday boy! 
  Make room for cheese puffs. 
  And do you remember the claw? 
  - Oh, no! 
  [LAUGHS] 
  - The claw! 
  Thank you so much for coming. 
  Please. 
  [LAUGHTER] 
  In celebration of our little guy's no, our big guy's birthday, Sophie and I have put together a little tune. 
  We love you, pal. 
  You've always got a friend in me. 
  Arms, legs, buns. 
  [LAUGHTER] 
  BOTH: You've got a friend in me You've got a friend in me When the road looks rough ahead And you're miles and miles from your nice, warm bed How great are they? 
  - You just remember what your old pal said - Pretty great. 
  Boy, you've got a friend in me - Yeah, you've got a friend in me - See, it's another reason I can't tell them. 
  If Sophie ever found out, her relationship with Eddie would be over. 
  Or it might reach a better level, because it's honest. 
  What? 
  I was talking to Katherine, - and she made some really good points. 
  - [CHARLIE FUSSING] 
  What happened to "trust my gut"? 
  No, you should. 
  It's just there there are things I hadn't considered. 
  - You've got your troubles - Like what? 
  I've got 'em, too - There isn't anything I wouldn't do for you - I don't know. 
  We stick together and we'll see it through - 'Cause you've got a friend in me - I don't know. 
  I realize that you're just trying to protect them. 
  - Yeah, you've got a friend in me - Believe me, I get that. 
  But I'm not sure lying is better. 
  You know what, Gina? 
  It feels like I'm being backed in a corner. 
  And I know you mean well, but it's complicated. 
  EDDIE: Sophie Dixon, everyone. 
  Look at your pretty dress! 
  Yeah? 
  Did Aunt Gina get this for you? 
  I didn't. 
  Her Aunt Katherine did. 
  - You've got a friend in me - You're right, D. 
  It is complicated. 
  Yeah, you've got a friend in me Happy birthday, Theo! 
  - Whoo! 
  - [CLEARS THROAT] 
  Hey, PJ, I'm so happy you could make it. 
  Yeah, yeah, me, too. 
  And And great job up there. 
  Yeah, okay, let's [CHUCKLES] 
  [INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS] 
  You're making a face. 
  You know PJ better than me. 
  Does this mom need to worry? 
  Worry? 
  No. 
  No. 
  Yes! 
  Hi, PJ. 
  Hey, Delilah. 
  Hi. 
  Hi, Rome. 
  PJ, I didn't know you'd be here. 
  Uh, yeah, Katherine said I could have a plus-one. 
  I didn't know I had to run that past you. 
  [LAUGHS NERVOUSLY] 
  Delightful. 
  So, PJ, where do you go to school? 
  Uh, Mom, leave him alone. 
  You're so embarrassing. 
  What? 
  No, I'm not. 
  Hello. 
  Okay. 
  So cute. 
  So cute. 
  Excuse me one second. 
  Hey, Katherine's been talking to Gina. 
  She's polling our friends. 
  I You can't do this to me. 
  We are not talking about this right now. 
  This is Theo's birthday. 
  - Hey, Katherine. 
  - Hi. 
  I hope it's okay I brought Julia. 
  - Are siblings invited? 
  - Of course! 
  Siblings are always welcome. 
  ROME: Come here, come here. 
  You do understand that she has a crush on you, right? 
  And you do understand that she might be your sister, and you do understand that is illegal in at least 49 states?! 
  I'm not trying to date her. 
  I just want to get to know someone who knew my dad. 
  - First of all, he's not - Do you want to know about Jon? 
  I'll tell you about him. 
  He was our North Star. 
  There will never be anyone like him again. 
  And if it turns out he's your dad, there are a thousand stories we're gonna tell you about him. 
  But just wait until we get the results. 
  Look, I know how much it hurt me to lose him. 
  I don't want you to feel that, too. 
  She's right. 
  And Sophie's hurting from that loss, too. 
  [SIGHS] 
  So, in case you are Jon's son, rip the Band-Aid off, but do it gently. 
  EDDIE: Okay, everyone, time for cake! 
  [CLAPS] 
  Gather 'round! 
  [CHILDREN CHEERING] 
  ALL: Happy birthday, dear Theo Happy birthday to you [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] 
  Okay, buddy, make a wish. 
  I don't need to. 
  I already got it. 
  MAN: Happy birthday, buddy. 
  [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] 
  Nice work! 
  Who wants cake? 
  I don't know how to use these. 
  How do you use these? 
  Whoa! 
  There's the guy. 
  What's up, man? 
  What's up, dude? 
  Hey, how's Colin? 
 
 
 
  - Uh - SOPHIE: There you are. 
  Want to go for a spin in my new/old car? 
  Yeah. 
  Yeah, l-let's do it. 
  Hey. 
  You okay? 
  Honestly, not really. 
  I keep trying to put my party face on, but so far, all I've done is eat my body weight in cheese puffs. 
  I'm giving Colin back. 
  I should go. 
  Spend one last day with my boy. 
  Okay, I'm gonna go say bye to Katherine and Eddie. 
  No, no, no, no, no, no, no. 
  You stay, you stay. 
  I need to do this by myself. 
  [SIGHS] 
  Bye-bye. 
  Bye, Charlie. 
  EDDIE: What? 
  There you go. 
  Thank you, guys. 
  I'm gonna go. 
  Gotta go do something for Gary. 
  Is he gonna be okay? 
  I hope so. 
  - Thanks for coming. 
  - Thank you. 
  Make sure you grab a goody bag. 
  - Ooh. 
  - Kidding. 
  There's not enough. 
  [LAUGHS] 
  Okay. 
  All right. 
  The three of us should probably talk. 
  Yeah, we should. 
  [LAUGHS] 
  Yeah, but I'm I'm glad we had a chance to talk away from the party. 
  Yeah, me too. 
  I'm Um, I'm really sorry for holding your hand w-without asking. 
  - It It It kind of just - Oh, no, no, no, I [CHUCKLES] 
  I didn't mind. 
  [CHUCKLES] 
  Yeah. 
  Yeah, yeah. 
  Well, look, I Oh, my God! 
  No! 
  - Oh, I - No, I I'm sorry. 
  I I'm so stupid. 
  No, no. 
  No, you're not. 
  No, you just want to be friends. 
  Well, no, not not exactly. 
  Okay, let's just go. 
  [ENGINE STARTS, REVS] 
  KATHERINE: There is no easy solution, but you have to understand where I'm coming from. 
  Yeah, but I've been thinking a lot about this. 
  I know this decision affects all of us. 
  [CELLPHONE BUZZES] 
  - It's Soph. 
  What? 
  - [CELLPHONE BEEPS] 
  Hey. 
  What?! 
  W-Where are you? 
  Is Is anybody hurt? 
  I'll be right there. 
  - [CELLPHONE BEEPS] 
  - Soph got in a car accident. 
  All right, C-man. 
  No pickles on your half. 
  You know you're the longest relationship I've ever had. 
  Yeah. 
  [CHUCKLES] 
  Really. 
  You've gotten me through some tough times, dude. 
  It's ironic, 'cause I think I think tonight is when I'm gonna need you the most. 
  What am I doing? 
  Your forever home is with me. 
  I'm your papa, right? 
  Hey. 
  I'm trying to have a moment with you, dude. 
  Colin. 
  Ah, ah, Colin, get back here! 
  Hey, Wesley. 
  All right, buddy, let's get you home. 
  Is everyone okay? 
  Yeah. 
  Yeah, we're fine. 
  Oh, God. 
  Sophie. 
  You okay? 
  Come here. 
  Oh. 
  - REGINA: What happened? 
  - I'm so sorry. 
  She She tried to kiss me. 
  - Oh, God, you didn't - What?! 
  No, I stopped it. 
  But then she did that. 
  SOPHIE: I can't believe I did this. 
  It's okay, Soph. 
  No, it's not. 
  It's Dad's car. 
  Well, cars can be fixed. 
  And you're safe. 
  That's what matters. 
  Hmm? 
  I don't know what I would do without you. 
  It's okay. 
  I'm here. 
  I'm not going anywhere. 
  MAGGIE: Hey. 
  There you are. 
  Guess what. 
  I can't find Mr. 
  Squirrel anywhere. 
  You know that's Colin's favorite, so I'm thinking maybe it's a sign. 
  Look at that. 
  You found it. 
  [SIGHS] 
  You should say goodbye. 
  Actually, Gary, you should say goodbye to Colin. 
  I'm taking him back for you. 
  Okay, first of all, Bloom, what taxi is gonna pick you up with a 100-pound mastiff? 
  As of a half-hour ago, I am now a fully licensed driver in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. 
  Yeah. 
  [CHUCKLES] 
  After you left the party, I made the Registry of Motor Vehicles keep my appointment. 
  You'd be proud of me. 
  I spoke to a State Trooper in a very strong tone. 
  You did all that for me? 
  You've done everything for me. 
  [SIGHS] 
  Please let me do this for you. 
  [SIGHS] 
  All right, listen up. 
  [CLEARS THROAT] 
  I'm not big on goodbyes, okay? 
  So, uh [INHALES SHARPLY] 
  You are the second-greatest roommate [COLIN WHINES] 
  Okay, okay, let's be real. 
  You're the greatest roommate. 
  [SIGHS] 
  I know that it was Maggie who made all those smells. 
  She should not have blamed you for that. 
  [CLEARS THROAT] 
  I don't want you to think this has anything to do with you and me, okay? 
  My door's always open. 
  I love you, buddy. 
  MAGGIE: Okay. 
  Come on, bud. 
  [SIGHS] 
  Come on. 
  Here we go. 
  This way. 
  [DOOR CLOSES] 
  [CRYING] 
  I'll be right back. 
  [DOOR CLOSES] 
  Danny forgot this. 
  Thanks again for watching them. 
  Of course. 
  We're just glad Sophie's okay. 
  KATHERINE: Yeah, thank goodness. 
  Get everyone home. 
  Uh, we can talk about this later. 
  No, there's nothing to talk about. 
  I know what's best for my kids. 
  And they can't lose me right now. 
  So we're sticking to the plan. 
  Which plan? 
  The plan that keeps Eddie away from his daughter? 
  The plan that makes me lie to my son? 
  You asked me a while ago what you could do to make this easier. 
  Well, this is it. 
  This is what you can do for me. 
  My kids lost their father. 
  I lost my husband. 
  Yeah, I know, D. 
  I think about Jon every day. 
  I'm sorry you lost your husband. 
  But I almost lost my husband, too because of you. 
  No, Katherine, this is not just because of Delilah. 
  This is because of me, too. 
  This is because of the mistakes we made. 
  And the only way I can fix this, the only way I can be the best version of myself is to tell the truth. 
  Eddie, we talked about this. 
  You agreed to it. 
  Delilah, I made a decision to get sober in order to be the best father I could be for Theo. 
  And 10 years later, I am making the decision to be the best father I can be for Charlie. 
  And that means being honest with both of my children. 
  Well, I made this decision because I thought I had your support. 
  You had months to change your mind. 
  And I understand why you needed to tell Katherine I do, I understand that but you're the reason she has to lie. 
  Not me. 
  I'm sorry for everything I've done. 
  I'm sorry that I hurt you. 
  But, Katherine, I will not let you hurt my kids. 
  Hey. 
  About earlier Let's not talk about that now. 
  [LID THUDS] 
  Today's about celebrating. 
  Katherine, I 10 years ago today, you got sober. 
  I didn't believe in you then, but I believe in you now.

  - He didn't even say goodbye to me. 
  - No, no, I'm sure he was fine. 
  I think I should check on him. 
  He didn't seem like himself. 
  Gary, get in the car! 
  All right. 
  GARY: Now you're acting weird. 
  [ENGINE STARTS] 
  Oh! 
  I don't understand. 
  - What don't you understand? 
  It's Colin. 
  - No, no, Colin's up there. 
  No, that's Maurice, the dog from the shelter on Teplow Street. 
  Unless the old lady asks, in which case that's "Wesley". 
  No, no, no, Maurice has a white spot on his ear. 
  No, Maurice used to have a white spot on his ear. 
  And Grandma will never be able to tell the difference. 
  But you will. 
  Oh, my God. 
  Can we do this? 
  Can we give a stray dog to a nice old woman who loves him? 
  We just did. 
  Get down, pal.
