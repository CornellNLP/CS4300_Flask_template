 Commander :  Enemy contact, three o'clock. Prepare to engage. 
 We are 200 meters away from being able to take evasive action. Gonna need cover. 
 Roger. We got your six. 
 Hold steady. 
 Copy that. 
 "I love the smell of jet fuel in the morning!" 
 That ain't the line, Chief. 
 I know it's not the line. 
 I know you know it's not the line. 
 We got 90 years of war movies. 
 Why does it always gotta be "I love the smell"? 
 Relax, Grayson. These are exercises. 
 Not like we're gonna see any real action in New Orleans anyways. 
 Speak for yourself. 
 She's six-one, her name's Sally, and I'm seeing her tonight. 
 Six-one? 
 Yep. 
 All right, let's lock this down and get your ass back to camp.

 Reports of Investigation. 
 Uploaded, scanned and entered. 
 Well, we call 'em R.O.I.s, but not a bad start. 
 Now, you can, uh... 
 Clean the shotguns? 
 Done. 
 Get Agent Pride his chicory? 
 Also done. 
 And that mail? 
 Collated by recipient, stacked by size. 
 Kind of into having a newbie, especially one that's not me. 
 Listen here, luscious locks, I transferred from ATF, which means I come in as a full agent. 
 Pride says you report to us. 
 That's 'cause you're the Agent NFG. 
 Yeah, I've read all the manuals... twice. 
 No such thing as "NFG." 
 Patton : Oh, oh, oh. 
 Let me clue you in. 
 "N" stands for "new." 
 "G" stands for "girl." 
 And the "F"? 
 Fancy? 
 Funky. 
 (laughs) 
 Okay, okay. 
 I get it. 
 Initiation. 
 Rite of passage. 
 But what you don't get is I can take whatever you dish out. 
 So, if you think you're gonna mess with me... think again. 
 I, uh, super-glued her badge shut. 
 (laughs) Oh, now that's good. 
 "The Jackal." 
 That's me. 
 Really? 
 Someone calls you The Jackal? 
 Ah. 
 Brotherman, brotherman. 
 Seafood crepes. 
 Ooh! Put one on a plate, then in my belly. 
 Ooh, hell of a lot of zeroes here. 
 From the sale of the house. 
 Divorce finalized? 
 Civil. 
 All good. 
 Yeah. 
 Been there, done that. 
 A couple of times. 
 Yeah, and I'm still trying to get it right. 
 Hey, man, what's your plans? 
 For this money? 
 I've seen that look before. 
 Listen. 
 All right, just imagine: you're in a field, dew on the ground, fog in the air. 
 You turn. 
 There she is, staring at you... 
 Sexy Sadie. 
 Sexy Sadie is a horse, right? 
 No, a racehorse. 
 Which you are this close to owning. 
 Someone blew up a Navy convoy. 
 Reporter : ...at least two casualties, with another six being transported to various hospitals across the city. 
 As for the culprit, no word other than... 
 Imagining time is over. 
 Work. 
 Man : We were simulating an armed transport mission. 
 The Marines were playing opposition force. 
 Got hit by an IED on the underside of the bridge. 
 Homeland's aware, same as NORTHCOM. 
 We got the Coast Guard assisting our people in the water. 
 Anyone claim responsibility? 
 Radio silent. 
 Cowards. 
 Successful attack on a military convoy? 
 Think someone would want to showcase their handiwork. 
 Unless the silence is because of what they took. 
 We were transporting a M982 Excalibur. 
 That's a GPS-guided missile. 
 Range of 36 miles. 
 Precision of a sniper rifle. 
 Thing can blow a plane out of the sky and decimate a train. 
 If somebody had the means of launching that thing... 
 Terrorist attack waiting to happen. 
 Here's your two dead. 
 Chief Pete Olson. 
 Petty Officer Miles Grayson. 
 Concussive force caused middle ear damage and eye ruptures in both Petty Officer Grayson and Chief Olson. 
 C.O.D.? 
 Probably blast lung. 
 Common in an IED attack. 
 Yeah, well, the vehicle these poor kids were driving basically ended up on top of one. 
 I'll have Sebastian analyze their clothes. 
 If there's any residue, it might be able to help you with the explosives they used. 
 Nice to see you again, Agent NFG. 
 You, too? 
 Found this on the bridge. 
 75-millimeter remote detonator. 
 That means our bomber had visual on the bridge. 
 So, he-- or she-- waits for the convoy to get to the bridge, then set the bomb off when the Humvee with the missile passes over. 
 Everything slams into the water, divers are waiting below. 
 That's a big-ass operation. 
 What's the range on that detonator? 
 Oh, anywhere from a thousand, 1,500 yards. 
 Make a perimeter, split up. 
 Go. 
 Brody and lasalle : Learn things. 
 Oh, is that, like, a... a thing we do? 
 Go, get out of here. 
 Oh. 
 (helicopter blades whirring) 
 (siren wailing) 
 Looks like the ground's disturbed. 
 Might be where he stood. 
 Damn good catch, Country Mouse. 
 Pays to be observant, City Mouse. 
 Oh, I'm observant. 
 What I observe is you in the same jeans for, like, three days, getting texts from chickadees named Kiki and Dawn. 
 Hey, I ain't judging. 
 Everybody's gotta find their way to grieve and move on. 
 Look over here. 
 Aren't gonna be any fingerprints on that. 
 Guy's smart enough to employ a solenoid air missile, he's gonna wear gloves. 
 Yeah, but if he's hungry enough to eat the messiest candy bar in the world... he's gonna take those gloves off. 
 So, now you can... 
 Scan the wrapper, put the data in the Mobile AFIS. 
 You gonna let me finish? 
 You were undercover at ATF; not much fingerprinting. 
 Okay? 
 So you gotta get this right. 
 Now, you can scan the wrapper and put the data in Mobile AFIS. 
 One point for Country Mouse. 
 Pride : Navy Petty Officer Mark Yaden. 
 Yaden was dishonorably discharged three years ago for insubordination. 
 Dude made a habit of bitching about how sending U.S. forces overseas was a misuse of government power. 
 After he got the boot, Yaden didn't let up. 
 Kept making threats... threats to make the Navy pay for its "vast governmental overreach." 
 Patton got a GPS on Yaden's phone. 
 It's active now, in the quarter. 
 I'll drive. 
 (jazz playing) 
 Says he's 20 yards away. 
 There he is, there's Yaden. 
 Got our suspect. 
 St. Peters and Jackson Square. 
 He's running. NCIS! 
 Yaden, stop! 
 Get down! 
 Get down! 
 He's got a gun, everybody get down! 
 (screaming) 
 Easy. 
 Just put the gun down. 
 Yaden, come on. 
 Nobody has to die here. 
 It's over. 
 Only just begun. 
 Sic semper tyrannis! 
 No, wait! 
 (gunshot) 
 (bystanders screaming) 
 "Sic semper tyrannis"? 
 "Thus always tyrants." 
 What John Wilkes Booth said after he assassinated Lincoln. 
 Pride : SECNAV's been notified. 
 NORAD, NORTHCOM and Homeland are all over our wayward missile. 
 Also put the Secret Service on notice. 
 Think that's called for? 
 Guy quotes one of four presidential assassins, gotta take it seriously. 
 Where we at? 
 Trying to figure out the size and scope of this bombing operation. 
 We searched the riverbanks below the bridge, found tire tracks and footprints, all different sizes and treads. 
 Most likely, it's where the Excalibur was taken out of the water. 
 And these people came with some serious know-how. 
 Excalibur has an onboard GPS, but whoever swiped it took it offline, preventing us from tracking it. 
 We know any more about Yaden? 
 So, I got Yaden. 
 Thank you. 
 Damn it. 
 Yaden... 
 We'll do a remote class later. 
 After being discharged, Yaden went off the grid. 
 Dude's a ghost from 2012 to 2014. 
 Then, two months ago, he reappears in New Orleans. 
 Percy, here, found an address at a one-bedroom rental in Westwego. 
 Questions on the table: who was Yaden working with, where's the missile now, and what the hell do they plan to do with it? 
 (phones ringing) 
 Loretta. I'll take it. 
 Brody and Christopher, go to Yaden's last known address. 
 Sonja, you and Patton stay on the missile's GPS. 
 There's nothing I hate more than "large caliber bullet to the head." 
 Spent two hours scooping up brain matter on Jackson Square. 
 Well, I might have something to cheer you up. 
 Contribution to Danny's college fund. 
 Oh, that's thoughtful, but I can't... 
 You can. I've already taken care of Laurel. 
 Set up a little place for my father, if he makes parole. 
 Still got a chunk left over. 
 And what are you gonna do with that chunk? 
 That remains to be seen. 
 It's a new chapter. 
 Got to heal. 
 Yeah. 
 Why don't you do something special for yourself? 
 Go big. 
 I'll buy an elephant. 
 (gasps) 
 Thank you. 
 Yaden? 
 I found this on his shoulder. 
 I took the liberty of checking it against the tattoo database. 
 The symbol is of a Montana Union. 
 It's a separatist group located outside Billings. 
 So, militia member from an outfit in Montana travels 2,000 miles to be part of this attack? 
 I also found an irritant in the lungs. 
 I'll identify the source in case Yaden's recent whereabouts gives us insight into where your missile went to. 
 And then there's this. 
 Chemical burns. 
 Yes, it's most likely from handling explosives. 
 I also discovered layered calluses. 
 Calluses which Yaden had, but John Wilkes Booth did not. 
 In college, I wrote a 30-page ballistics analysis of the Lincoln assassination. 
 Do you know the play that Lincoln was seeing the night that Booth shot him? 
 Our American Cousin. 
 You know who Lincoln was sitting with? 
 Major Rathbone and his fiancée. 
 You read my paper. 
 I took American history. 
 Right, that... makes a lot more sense. 
 Sebastian, calluses. 
 Oh, okay. 
 So I ran a, uh, tissue analysis, and I found micro-strands of polyurethane and fiberglass. 
 And these are the key components... in, uh, hand grips at modern climbing gyms. 
 Your bomber scaled the bridge in order to place the explosives. 
 He would've had to train for it somewhere. 
 Thank you both. 
 Uh, I'll forward what I got on the Montana militia to Agent Percy. 
 Pride : All right, and I'll let Chris and Brody know about the climbing angle. 
 I'll head back to my office. 
 That way, we all have something to do. 
 I called ahead; we're supposed to talk to Sara Strand. 
 She's been working with Yaden since he moved to New Orleans. 
 Nice work, Jackal. 
 Uh, nickname in high school. 
 Look, someone mailed me these random high school pictures. 
 No name. 
 No return address. 
 Might be an old boyfriend. 
 Mr. Music, there, he's eyeing you. 
 Woman : So, just sign right here... 
 Brody : There's Sara. 
 Brunette. 
 Sara : Mark blew up a bridge? 
 He seemed sweet, laid-back. 
 Uh, watch that top hand, Katy! 
 I mean, I only knew him for a couple of months, but he just seemed like one of those extreme sports dudes. 
 He was extreme, all right. 
 Uh, you know, I'd be happy to hand over all our records if that helps. 
 Yeah, it would. 
 Every detail counts. 
 Okay. 
 Good, mm-hmm. 
 Ever rock-climb, Lasalle? 
 Got a fear of heights, remember? 
 Oh, that's right. 
 Well, one of the key elements is bare fingers for grip, and she's wearing gloves. 
 Lasalle : And long sleeves. 
 I wonder what's underneath all that. 
 Brody : You and Yaden built the bomb that killed two innocent sailors. 
 Nobody's truly innocent, are they? 
 Certainly you're not. 
 The opposition is rising, Agent Brody. 
 The Stars and Stripes will burn, and out of its ashes will manifest a revolution. 
 The Excalibur. 
 Where is it? 
 Sic semper tyrannis. 
 Sara Strand is really Darla Hendricks, a member of the Free State Nation, a separatist group out of South Carolina. 
 Their goal: the abolishment of the military-industrial complex. 
 Same basic ideology as Yaden, but both groups are reclusive. 
 And from elsewhere. 
 And it looks like they're not alone. 
 Checked in with my old ATF contacts for info on the Montana Union, hit the mother lode. 
 (beeps) 
 All right, you want to work that out for me? 
 No problem, City Mouse. 
 Cool. 
 Red dots are known militants. 
 Now, I built my own database, found travel records, new addresses. 
 You got members of the Southern United Alliance, Wyoming Marksmen, Arizona Separatists, all migrating to New Orleans in the past nine months. 
 "Revolution" is what she said. 
 Sonja : We're talking the most dangerous anti-American militants this country has to offer. 
 Working together... in New Orleans... 
 ...on a plan which involves some big-ass missile. 
 90 militants massing in New Orleans? 
 Quite a catch, Dwayne. 
 Wish I could take credit, Miguel, but ATF's loss is our gain. 
 Mighty Mouse. 
 (Sonja and Miguel laugh) 
 Not bad for an NFG. 
 You got to be kidding me. 
 Agent Lasalle paid me. 
 Well, I'm taking the blood money. 
 Went spelunking around the back-end forums of separatists sites-- 
 Separatist Watch, Patriot Renegades-- 
 I'm gonna need, like, three showers tonight. 
 In the last decade, ATF has developed multiple aliases using dummy accounts in order to monitor activity. 
 And in the last year, a ton of chatter. 
 People pledging allegiance to someone going by the nickname "the Father." 
 The Father? Is that...? 
 Brant Boudreau. 
 Now, here's where we do a short prayer, hope that I do this right. 
 Yes. 
 Brant Boudreau. 
 Miguel : Back in the late naughts, we chased Boudreau all over the South on weapons charges. 
 In 2010, he shed his real name, insisted on being called "the Father." 
 Saw himself as the patriarch of the modern American militia movement. 
 Now, militias have always been fragmented and fringe. 
 Boudreau's vision was to bring them all together, modernized and weaponized. 
 All right, so I digitized the videos like you asked. 
 They're up on the server. 
 Uh, can you play the recruitment video? 
 Mm-hmm. 
 Sonja : So based on an embedded time stamp, this was filmed over a year ago, but it was just recently uploaded. 
 Our government and its muscle, the military, are run by oligarchs, fattening their pockets with excessive tax on true Americans. 
 They are liars and cheats. 
 And the great sin against our great country is being cowed and controlled by false prophets. 
 Boudreau is working off the tipping point theory. 
 He believes a series of successful attacks would upend domestic financial markets, cause an economic downturn and incite people to turn on the government. 
 And we have any line on him? 
 We got a list of 30 properties that were or still are owned in Boudreau's name. 
 Take Lasalle, check 'em all. 
 Sonja : 15th property, nothing. 
 Yeah, this one's a little shabby, even for a country mouse. 
 Ooh. 
 I got $20 say you feel right at home. 
 (whispering): Hey. 
 Someone's in here. 
 NCIS! 
 Federal agents! 
 Who the hell are you?! 
 NCIS! 
 Prove it! 
 Sonja : Okay. 
 Now I'm gonna reach down and get my badge... and flip it open. 
 Yo, what the hell? 
 Don't look at me; Brody did it. 
 Here you go, ma'am. 
 NCIS. 
 Drop the weapon. 
 So you're Anna Boudreau, Brant Boudreau's ex-wife? 
 And you live in here? 
 It's all I got. 
 Brant... took the family money. 
 Ruined us. 
 Any idea where Brant is now? 
 Don't know. 
 Don't care. 
 What? 
 You want to check my phone? 
 You check whatever the hell you want. 
 I used to try and find him for alimony. 
 It just... ain't no use. 
 Whenever I go looking... trouble finds me. 
 Trouble got a name, miss? 
 If I told you, that would come back at me. 
 Know what else will come back at you? 
 Bersa Thunder. 
 Serial number's been altered. 
 Ooh, that's a federal offense. 
 No bueno. 
 
 
 
 What do you want to know? 
 Boudreau's ex says a guy named Zed Haings is second in command. 
 Trained Army Ranger, went bad just like Yaden. 
 Narcotics, aggravated assault. 
 Known Klansman. 
 Your guy there, Hastings, is "Red Eagle" online. 
 He's been in touch with many of the out-of-state militants that Agent Percy has confirmed are in New Orleans. 
 Brody : Want me to put out a BOLO? 
 Picking Hastings up alerts Boudreau that we're closing in. 
 He'll likely go further underground. 
 And launch whatever attacks he has planned. 
 What if we engage him? 
 I can get our resources down here in 24 hours. 
 You said you've developed aliases? 
 Let's use one to get inside. 
 You? 
 Always wanted to join the revolution. 
 Sonja : Huh. 
 Can't say I  like  the look. 
 That makes two of us. 
 Oh, your wife get all the good stuff? 
 What you got, Percy? 
 Dossier on ATF's identity. 
 Marcus Kyle, Kansas Radicals. 
 Thanks. 
 And this is your lifeline. 
 Audio and a tracker. 
 And listen, Hastings, he's gonna throw some names out there, try to trip you up. 
 I know. 
 Speak as little as possible. 
 Every word is a potential trap. 
 I've done this before. 
 Lasalle : King. 
 Got a potential meet with Hastings. 
 Well, take Brody. 
 Percy, you keep Patton on task. 
 I want to be there. 
 Back at the ATF, you were on the street... making your own rules, your own thing. 
 Here, part of a team. 
 You do what's needed. 
 And right now, that's figuring out where those videos were taped. 
 Aside from that... appreciate your worry. 
 These pictures aren't real. 
 You mentioned Mr. Music Man, right? 
 So, I looked into it. 
 Turns out it's a guy named Billy Jay. 
 A friend of my sister's. 
 The one that was killed? 
 Yeah. In fact, all these people are my sister's friends, and I don't remember doing any of this stuff. 
 So, what? 
 Someone photoshopped you? 
 Into random pictures that my sister was originally in. 
 Pride (over radio) : Going in now. 
 All right, he's in. 
 Wasn't gonna come. 
 Didn't think you boys had much going on till I heard what happened on the bridge. 
 Ye of little faith. 
 I put stock in what I see. 
 Tucker Klint says you're a good man, says you're up for a fight. 
 We go back. 
 Yeah, I bet you do. 
 Who else you know? 
 Carl Wahl? 
 Big Ruddy? 
 Taylor Hoff? 
 Testing me? 
 Just making sure. 
 Yeah, well... 
 Carl Wahl is out of North Dakota. 
 Big Ruddy... probably made up. 
 Taylor Hoff's been dead since '09. 
 It's a little late for testing. 
 If I was you, I wouldn't let me get within a thousand feet unless I'd been fully vetted. 
 I'm legit. 
 Not sure about you anymore. 
 Hey! 
 How far you willing to go to see how legit I am? 
 (static crackling over radio) 
 Let's get him out. 
 Clear. 
 There's no way they could've got out of here without us seeing them. 
 (whispers): Lasalle. 
 Brody : Crawl space. 
 Lasalle : Watch was his lifeline. 
 ♪ ♪ 
 Brody :  We followed the tunnel. 
 It dumps out at a gravel road about an eighth of a mile from the bar. 
 Found tire tracks, heading south. 
 Brody : Sending you a picture of the tread right now. 
 Lasalle : Get them to Sebastian. 
 See if he can identify the vehicle. 
 Uh, okay, but, um, I'm trying to pull up your location so I can access the traffic cams, but... 
 Yeah, I got your back, sister. 
 (sighs) Thank you. 
 Brody : Where are you with Boudreau's videos? 
 You got anything? 
 We're trying to trace his I.P. address. 
 Hoping it'll lead to wherever Pride has gone, but these guys got some serious encryption software. 
 So, we're driving blind? 
 Patton : Yeah. 
 The minute I got something, you will, too. 
 Thanks, Pat. 
 My guess? 
 King's already hot on finding the missile. 
 We're here. 
 (gunfire in distance) 
 Welcome to the resistance, brother. 
 Ruby Ridge, Waco... they knew the truth. 
 But they were backwoods, low-tech. 
 They had no plan, so they ended up sitting ducks, waiting to get roasted on a spit. 
 We got a plan? 
 Yeah, we got a toy. 
 (cell phone ringing) 
 Father calls. 
 Yo, Loco! 
 Let's go. 
 Eyes to the sun, brother. 
 'Cause when it goes down, we take our fight to the betrayers. 
 (motor starts) 
 You looking for something? 
 You was poking around. 
 I was just hungry. 
 Got any food around here? 
 I know you. 
 You local? 
 Out of Kansas. 
 Been there? 
 There's a stocked freezer in the mess. 
 I'll show you. 
 Our New America will return to the values of the Original America, (sighs) and will protect, first, the Original Americans. 
 Tell me you need some help, 'cause that tire tread that Brody and Lasalle sent me is about as useful as a kangaroo on a pogo stick. 
 That made more sense on the drive over. 
 Not much better here. 
 Father videos? 
 Man, I can't listen to his ass anymore. 
 Hey, come see if you grok what I been going batty over. 
 (chuckles) Did you just use the word "grok"? 
 Uh... 
 Well, there's a light. 
 Yeah, but where's it coming from? 
 Sebastian : Let's zoom in. 
 The lights show up in every video? 
 Most, but not all. 
 It goes from right to left in the frame. 
 And it's always the same height on the wall. 
 Reflection from a camera lens? 
 Camera's locked off. 
 It wouldn't be floating like that. 
 Headlights through a window? 
 If they were headlights... 
 The diameter would shift as the vehicle got further away, right. 
 I just want you to know that I'm suppressing the urge to whistle the theme to  Close Encounters  right now. 
 Hey, Dr. Wade wants us on the plasma. 
 (computer chirps) 
 Heard from Dwayne? 
 Nothing. 
 Well, if it helps, I've identified the irritant in Yaden's lungs. 
 It's silicon dioxide-- sand. 
 Did you, uh, run a chemical breakdown? 
 Forwarding it now. 
 Sebastian : Uh, two percent chlorite, one percent glauconite with a high concentration of oil deposits. 
 Ton of beaches were affected by the Deep Water Horizon spill. 
 That's miles and miles of coastline. 
 But how many beaches are... 
 Both : ...near lighthouses? 
 The light goes and comes. 
 Yeah, moves right to left, always the same height on the wall. 
 A lighthouse lamp would do that. 
 Thank you, Dr. Wade. 
 Okay, pulling up maps right now. 
 All right, all right, lighthouses near beaches affected by the Deep Water spill. 
 Sonja : There. 
 Near Holly Beach. 
 Gonna go notify my agent abusers. 
 The Father-- he live there? 
 That's where he makes the plans. 
 Look forward to meeting him. 
 No one meets the Father, except Zed. 
 Safer that way. 
 Awful big house for one person, huh? 
 Last night, I saw him wheel some piece of munitions out there. 
 Big mystery what exactly, but... you ever heard of the USS  Eagle? 
 That a ship? 
 Navy. 
 Docked in New Orleans. 
 From what I hear, we're gonna sink it. 
 Sic semper tyrannis. 
 Sic semper tyrannis. (alarm blaring) All right, boys, we got company! Come on! The river, go! This way. Cover the river! You! With me! Right here. This way, this way right here. Turn right here. No movement. All right, I'll pull ashore. Conner : Come on. Kevlar vests. Bet you they're Feds. Hey, bud. You shoot, they'll return fire. Doesn't matter. We got to put them down before they call for backup. Just a little closer, I can take them both out. Come on, little closer. Come on. (Lasalle grunts) Brody : Lasalle! What the hell?! Why should you have all the fun? Are you all right? Yeah. He hit my vest. See who shot me. Pride. What? I think Pride's the one who shot you. Pride? Got close to a hundred federal agents moving into position. We can move in a moment's notice. We got to be careful. Pride's in there. I'm good. I think USS  Eagle  is under attack. Pride did this. Sign language for "eagle." First Russian, now sign language? You're a woman of many talents, Brody. USS  Eagle  docked at port this morning. So I'll contact the Navy, get Sonja over there. We got to move that ship out of range. All right. What the hell happened out there? I hit the male agent, but I don't think I killed him. Next time. Next time is now! Listen up! Orders from Father! When the alarm sounds, we take our fight to them! What's the alarm for? It means the toy is ready. (chuckles) (alarm ringing) Man (over p.a.) : All hands, make immediate preparations for getting underway. How long is it gonna take you to get out of the port? Another 20 minutes. I don't think you have that kind of time, Commander. Don't have a choice, Agent Percy. You don't just snap your finger and move tons of metal and sail it. You don't understand. Trust me, nobody knows the damage the Excalibur can do more than me. There's plenty for all of us. No need to be greedy this time, friend. (groans) Jammed. Let me see. Nah, no. Let me get another one. Lot of movement over there. They get the  Eagle  out of port? Another ten minutes. Lasalle : Yeah, something's going down. According to this map, if we cross the river about a mile up, we can access a drainage pipe that lets out behind this building. You think we can get in unnoticed? I think we can try. Man : Hey! Where the hell you think you're going? Well, I was just... ♪ ♪ Conner : Drop that gun! Drop it! (rifle clatters) What is this? Come on... (grunting) I said, sit down! There's a traitor in our midst! You saw him in there. The Father is dead, for a long time. So ask yourselves: who killed him? Who did it? Could have been this guy right here. This man... this man is wrong. Could have been you. What are you talking about? Or Zed. Anybody see Zed? Or you or you! Whoever did it, he couldn't have been leading you. He couldn't have been leading us! The Father couldn't have given orders to take on an army of federal agents. So who exactly have we been following? And what exactly are we all about die for? That can't be him! What the hell's going on here?! (men clamoring) Back up! (shouting) What's going on here?! I'll see you in hell. (gunshot) Brody : End of the line, kids! Everybody get down, get down! (agents shouting) Police! Get down! Put your weapons away! Brody : Drop your weapons! Drop your weapons! Down! Lasalle : Hey! Drop your weapons! (agents continue shouting) I got the one who shot me! You're coming with me. Miguel : Found the Excalibur. And here's what's odd. This thing isn't in any shape to blow up anything. No kidding. Zed Hastings-- when's the last time you laid eyes on him? Before I rushed the house. We got everyone else accounted for. Zed is gone. Miguel : Use the reputation of a dead man in order to assemble the manpower to steal a weapon you can't use? What are we missing? Sebastian :  So the attack on the bridge was never about the missile itself. It was about a chip inside the Excalibur. Specifically, a telematics guidance chip. You remember how we couldn't track the missile 'cause we just assumed that the GPS system had been taken offline? Well, I don't think it was taken offline so much as it was... Stolen? Snuffleupagus. Well, what good is the chip without the missile? Well, think of it like a cell phone, all right? If you steal my cell phone, then you have access to all my contacts, as well as a bunch of horrifying selfies I took on a roller coaster. But if it was the U.S. Navy... Then my contacts on the telematics would give you access to the whereabouts and activities of almost every military asset that we have. It's a seven-figure windfall if you could sell it to one of our enemies. You think this Zed guy's got it? No. Zed was stuck in the compound, bluffing that he was about to bomb the Navy. So he's the diversion. Allowing someone else to walk away with the telematics chip. Someone else, like who? Dental records confirm the body found at the compound was in fact "The Father" Brant Boudreau. Dead how long? Based on standard decomp rates, dampness, I'd say a year. Before recruitment started. Cause of death? Gunshot wound to the head. Bullet entered here, exited at the right temple. I was able to retrieve a fragment of it, and Sebastian suggests it's a .380 ACP. That caliber works with Bersa Thunder. And we've seen that weapon recently. $600 room in a Nassau hotel? Who's paying? Russians? Pakistanis? Got our suspect. And our asset. Sit. How'd you find me? Your friend Zed. One you were so scared of. Had a ticket to the Bahamas. Didn't pick it up. My guess, he's on the run. Well, you won't catch him. Caught you. Got to ask. How much were they gonna pay you, Anna? You think this is about money? My ex, he wanted money. But you know what? He never even believed a word that came out of his own mouth. Is that why you killed him? He was in the way. And he couldn't see. See what? That the Russians, the Pakistanis, the jihadists-- we all have a common enemy: the U.S. government. And the busier they keep you, the easier it is for us to prevail. Sic semper tyrannis. Movements have mothers, too. (handcuffs clicking) (piano playing quietly) No! You took your money and bought a bar? Go big, she told me. (laughs) It's kind of a fixer-upper. New beginnings. Well, what do you call it? CFA. "Charity for all. "With malice toward none, "charity for all, "let us strive on to finish the work we are in, "to bind up the nation's wounds." Those who want to tear us apart quote Booth. I'll quote Lincoln. (chuckles): It's damn straight. (laughs) Lucky for you, King, you hit me in the Kevlar. Thank you for that. (laughs) 'Cause I got a A in shop. (laughs) Okay. I like it. It's-it's kitschy. "Kitschy." Is that "ugly"? Technically, "kitschy" means something appealing to lowbrow taste, but in this case, it means awesome. Could've been a sexy racehorse. (chuckles) Guys, where's Percy? Oh, I sent her for provisions. And I damn well better get reimbursed for it, too. Brody : Absolutely. Lasalle : Oh, we'll get right on that. (laughter) Coming in with some attitude. Well, let me lighten that load for you. Hate to spoil a party, but we got to talk. About you. No secrets. Found on a dozen militant sites. Taken on the compound. My guess, Zed took it. That's you, King. They're asking who the cop is. Took a $50,000 bounty out. Anyone wants me... ...tell them I'll be right here. How we doing over there, Mac? Hey, I'm slaying. (piano continues) That Dr. John? No. Sure is. No, it isn't! (shrieks) Get out of here! (excited chatter, whooping) Lasalle : Come on, baby. ♪ I been in the right place ♪ 
♪ Must have been the wrong time ♪ 
♪ I been in the right state ♪

♪ I been in the right place ♪ 
♪ But it was the wrong song ♪
