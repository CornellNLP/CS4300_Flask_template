 Travis : Stay close. Get to the truck. 
 (woman screams) 
 (crashing, screams) 
 Daniel : Griselda! 
 Liza : We need a doctor, Trav. 
 Chris : What's wrong with that man, Dad? 
 Travis : People are gettin' sick. 
 Liza : They don't die. 
 They keep coming back. 
 Ofelia : We can't handle this on our own. 
 Daniel : I can handle it. 
 Ofelia : Papa, we need help. 
 Nick : Is that all we have? 
 Madison : I gave the rest to Griselda. 
 Nick : I need my medicine. 
 Madison : This thing's getting worse, not better. 
 It's not safe.

People just like us run like cattle,  piled into trucks, one suitcase apiece. Headed east. At least that's the rumor. Bakersfield, Vegas, who knows? ♪ You just keep me hanging on... ♪ Chris's voice :  It's safe inside the fence. Outside, everything's dead, everyone's gone. This is, uh, day nine. Nine days since the lights went out  and that fence went up and our little green friends moved in. Soldier :  Let's roll! Travis says we're the lucky ones. He'd throw those dudes a parade if they'd let him. And, look, we are grateful to our saviors,  to the ones who protect us,  to those who know  when it's feeding time at the zoo. Turns out there's nothing you'll ever take that nature won't take back. (chirping) It all belongs to her again. And the dogs and the dead and the... ♪ You just keep me hangin' on ♪ 
♪ You just keep me hangin' on... ♪ Hello. (theme music playing) (ticking) Hey, we have to repaint the family room. We did last week. I know, it needs a new coat. Travis found some more paint in the garage. (sighs) What's the point? Semi-gloss. What? Excuse me? I mean, no one's coming to the open house, Mom. Market's taken a bit of a turn. I can still see the stains. Hey, you can see the ocean. (panting) What? Still not on? Oh, they probably don't want to strain whatever's left of the grid. Don't worry. They're gonna get it sorted. Oh, my God. (laughs) Where are you going? Huh? Moyers, he's making some kind of announcement. He asked me to attend. Well, we wouldn't want to upset him, would we? Okay. What's the problem? Uh, how much time do you have? Maddie... My house is a refugee camp, my daughter's room is an ICU unit for strangers. Someone has to cook, someone has to clean... Listen, calm down. ...someone has to watch Nick. Well-- And that someone, somehow, is me. 'Cause I don't know where your ex-wife goes. She's helping sick people. Is this about Liza? What? No, it's about you. Me? Yeah, you run off to play man of the people... I'm not playing. ...with your soldier friends... This is not easy. ...and I could use a little bit of help here-- Stop. Oh, my God, just stop it. This domestic bickering like it's normal, like you're normal people in a normal kitchen. It's not normal. Stop it. Stop acting like it is. You ready to go? Please. Do it. Come on, just do it. Come on. (grunts) Chris, what do you think you're doing? Get down here. Dad, you gotta see this. Chris, now. I want you to help Madison, okay? Okay, just look at this. I don't have time for-- Just five seconds. Look. There, you see that? See what? What am I looking at? It's like a light or a glint, but they said there's nothing alive out there. Okay, come inside. Dad, I think there's someone out there. There's no one out there. It's just the sun's caught some reflection and... You got to stop, okay? (grunts) Come on. I found this on the counter. Oh, yeah, I guess I forgot. Oh, you forgot? Yeah. I guess I did. Okay, here it is. Oh, no, thanks. I'm good. I don't think that's the best idea. Well, I got to kick it. That's the whole point, right? Nick, come on. Nick-- Look, give it to Griselda. She needs it more than I do. You said so yourself. I know what I said, but the point is to wean you off of it slowly. So it just doesn't, you know, happen again. I thought you'd be happy. I am happy, I just... (water splashes) Okay, well, if you need it, it's right here. Don't be a hero. No chance of that. -  Hey, Mom? Yeah? Are you okay? Enjoy your swim. All right, listen up here, folks. (radio chatter) As commanding officer of this detachment, I am proud to announce that we are infect free  for a six mile radius around this perimeter. We are on the offensive. The tide has most definitely turned. -  Yeah. (scattered applause) All right, command asked that I read from the following. "Be advised, the DZ remains off-limits while Hazmat teams dispose of any bio-hazardous material." Woman :  What bio-hazardous material? Hey, I'm supposed to read this, you're supposed to listen, okay? Man :  When will you get the phones up? "Anyone attempting to compromise or circumvent the perimeter of this camp will be detained." Man #2 :  Are we being relocated? Sir, this is a secure position, so, no, you're gonna stay put. "Curfew will remain in effect until further notice. The new health screening policy will continue. Sanitation, water treatment, and other services will return as we approach total containment." Sir, we need medicine. What about that? We are working on that. "So keep boiling that water. You will also find several iodine tablets in your weekly rations." Where are the people outside the fence? Where did you move them? Crowd :  Where? Where? All right, folks, listen. You are in one of 12 safe zones south of the San Gabriels, okay? So you guys are the lucky ones. You guys-- you get to stay in your homes,  ride this thing out, all right? So, relax, count your blessings, be nice. So I don't have to shoot you. Yeah. What's your name, miss? Uh, Alicia Clark. Oh, Clark. Yeah, right here. (crowd murmuring) Hi. Hi. (laughs) Ofelia Salazar. Oh, could you spell that for me? S-A-L-A... you're not even looking. Oh. Yeah, no, here it is. Um, Ofelia. (chattering) Mr. Manawa? Yes, sir? Moyers :  A word, please. Come on. Soldier :  Have a nice day. Ofelia : Yeah, you, too. Man :  Just one case per family, ma'am. That's how it goes. Moyers : Guy who lives in this house with the covered car, Thompson. Doug Thompson? Yeah. Yeah, okay. So, he won't do the screening. And his wife thinks for some reason maybe you could talk some sense into him. Well, I don't really know him. We had a beer once, and he showed me his car he's rebuilding. You're a gearhead? Well, I've kept my father's Ford going for over 30 years. Dude, 30 years! That is so great. Can you help me or no? Well, it's just I don't really know the guy. Okay. Okay, thing is here is I'm trying to avoid a situation. So either you're gonna go in and you're gonna talk him down,  or I'm gonna go in, I'm gonna take him down. Yeah or no? Okay. Good. Gloves on, let's go. How long's he been in there? He was acting strange yesterday, and then at dinner he, uh... Maria, how long? Since then. Since dinner last night. The soldiers wanted to talk to him, but I thought-- I thought it would be better if it was from someone he knew, and he's liked you so much, so... (knocks) Doug? Doug? Doug? (door creaking) What's going on? Hey, Trav. You're worrying your family, man. I know that. But I don't-- I don't think I can do it. Do what? (crows cawing) Take it easy. Take it easy. They keep asking me what's happening. They keep asking me if everything's gonna be okay and I-- I don't have the words. It is gonna be okay. That's what you say. That's all that you have to say. Will they know that I'm lying? Doug, your family needs you. Now. They need you to go outside that door and tell that guard that you're gonna be okay. Show 'em that you're okay. (sniffles) That's all. (sighs) Yeah. (exhales) -  (birds chirping) (objects tinkling) (crying) Hang in there, buddy. (tinkling) (machine humming) Hey, handsome. I got to go. You have plenty of juice for the night, okay? Mm-hmm. He's stable. Morphine's helping. You can't stay? I made some soup. Squash from my garden. I have other people to check on. Please take some with you. You must have seen a lot of people like Hector. At the hospital? Yes. Take it. I don't know what I would have done. Hector is all I have. Thank you. Woman :  Thank you, Liza. See you tomorrow. (sighs) Why show me that? Do you see it? I mean, why not show your dad? I tried. He just said it wasn't anything. Well, maybe he's right. It could just be a piece of metal or a window or, you know, I don't know. Look, there's a pattern, okay? Someone's out there. A human someone, someone who needs our help. We don't know that. What else could it be? Why else would it just-- If someone needs help, they go to the soldiers. Unless they can't. Or they won't. Do you see it? (machine humming) (labored breathing) 3-2 Echo, this is Bravo Actual... 3-2 Echo, this is Bravo Actual... Don't you have to get that? They'll leave a message. (laughs) You're in my head all day. I can't concentrate. (laughs, gasps) (moaning) Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa. Wait, wait, wait. (exhales) Maybe we should just slow down a little. Right. Yeah, we should. I'm sorry. Are you upset? No. No, it's okay. I just-- I like you, Ofelia. That's all. Yeah, you're like the only thing that makes me believe there's still good in people. Hey, of course there is. Hey, um... did you get the medicine? I tried. I asked the corpsman. What'd he say? They got it all locked down tight. I guess they're stockpiling for the big push to take the city back. It's just, um, my mom's really sick, so... Yeah, I know that. (scoffs) Man on radio :  3-2 Echo, Interrogative: Where the hell is my damn truck? I'm sorry. Please advise. Bravo Actual, this is 3-2 Echo. Finishing patrol. Heading back. (gate buzzes) (radio chatter) (panting) Was that make-up s*x? We got to fight more. (chuckles) (panting) Whoo. Hey. What's the hurry? I thought that was nice. It was. (exhales) I got things to do. Can't it wait? Come here. Come back. (belt buckle clinking) (sighs) What's going on? I don't know. There's no news from anywhere. Vivian said she heard soldiers  talking about quarantine camps out near Barstow. I mean, I don't know. She's a gossip, but... No, I meant with you. What's going on with you? I mean, you're buzzing around here all day every day,  driving yourself nuts. I mean, you hover, clean, watch Alicia and Nick like a hawk. Nick needs to be watched. Yeah, I know. Still. Well, if we're exchanging parenting tips, you might want to pay more attention to Chris. Oh, okay. I mean, all I do all day is pay attention to-- Positive attention. All right. How come I feel like I'm being called into your office? Hmm? I missed you. He showed me the video he took from the roof. Jesus, that kid has got a world-class imagination. You know that. I saw it, too. I did. Yeah? Okay. What did you see? I don't know, like a-- like a light. Mm-hmm. Like someone reflecting the sun. Great. So you saw a light. What am I supposed to do with that? Go to Moyers and say, what? "I-- my kid saw a light, so your soldiers, tell them to drop their duties and--" That is their duty. It's nine days. What have they done? They promised medicine, doctors, electricity, information. Where is it? What about the phones? Don't you wonder why they can't get a landline? - No, I don't wonder. Cell towers? Nothing? - Maybe they got something bigger to worry about. Well, maybe they don't want the phones to work. Oh, babe, are you listening to yourself? You're talking paranoid. I don't want to encourage this with Chris, and you shouldn't either. So you did see it. 
 
 Maria :  Travis! Travis! (Maria knocking) Travis!  It's Maria. (knocking continues) Maria? What are you doing out? It's past curfew. They can shoot me. What's wrong? Doug's gone. I was in the back of the house with the girls and I don't know where he went. All right, calm down, calm down. Just breathe. He's missing. Okay, what did you say to him? I didn't say anything. He took his car. He took his stupid, precious car and I don't know where he went. Okay, let's take the girls inside. No, they stay with me. Look, I'm sure he's fine. He's just clearing his head somewhere, that's all. We're not allowed to drive inside the fence, Travis. It's not allowed. I know, I know. I understand. So what-- what if he-- oh, my God. No, look, just don't go there, please, all right? I'm gonna find him. I'll find your dad, all right? We'll find him, yeah? Come on, I'll walk you home. (birds chirping) (clicking) (bird warbling) sh1t. (clicking) Ah, Christ. I hooked it. Travis :  His wife's worried he went over. I'm just asking that you send out one patrol. He hasn't been missing long. He's not missing. We pulled Doug Thompson last night. Found him up by the fence bawling his eyes out in his damn muscle car. That guy, man, he is-- he's a head case. Can't have that around camp. God damn it! Don't look at me like that. It's not my order, though I agree with it. You should, too. You talked to the guy, didn't you? He seem okay to you? No.  No. So what are we talking about? Thompson gets the help he so desperately needs back at headquarters, I don't have to worry about some guy going psycho inside the fence. That's a win-win. You could've notified his wife, sir. I'm not a social worker. That's your job, Mr. Mayor. Now, you go ahead and notify away. What? My son, he saw a light in the DZ  up on the hillside. There's nothing alive out there. He didn't see anything. We, uh-- we went house to house, block by block. I know. Forget it. Already did. Oh, that's money. (knocks) Cynthia? Cynthia? Liza, there you are. Where's Hector? Getting the care he needs. Who are you? I'm Dr. Exner. Cynthia :  She's from the government. Cynthia's told me all about you. Oh. What did she tell you? That you're the reason why her husband's alive. That you're a very good nurse. Cynthia :  Nurse practitioner. That's basically a doctor. Where did you take Hector? Sit down. I want to see him. Cynthia was kind enough to show me this chart, and I'll admit I'm not familiar with some of these-- Look, I should explain this to you-- Cynthia, do you mind if Liza and I speak privately? Oh, no, no, no. That's great. Of course. (sighs) I should get packed anyways. Liza, you're an angel. Oh... Where's she going? She wanted to be with her husband. Where is that? You used a morphine drip. Unorthodox. I, uh-- I didn't have any nitrates, so I had to salvage from another neighbor. I needed to find a way to get the pressure off of his heart. What about your other patients? I've already met four people that swear you're the reason they're alive. I'm just making them comfortable. Hector's the only crit case. Well, you did very well, considering you're not actually a nurse. Are you? He was gonna die. I didn't know what else to do. I needed to get her to trust me so that she could let me-- so that I can help. It's all right. Desperate times. Perhaps you'd be willing to pretend a little longer? Excuse me? (snapping) (wind blowing) Oh! (gags) (flies buzzing) (flies buzzing) Ah! (radio chatter) (radio chatter) (flies buzzing) It was under control. I drained it. We change the dressing twice a day. No antibiotics, this was always the outcome. It's not anything you did. We're gonna take care of you. How are you gonna do this? We have a facility nearby. Military facility? It's military now, fortified. We have beds, surgeons, which, I'm afraid, is what your wife's injury requires. My wife would like to know how far this place is. Close, 15 minutes. Not a lot of traffic these days. I'm going with her. Of course. She's your wife. Uh-huh. (Griselda speaking Spanish) No, no, no, no, no. (speaking Spanish) No, no, no, no. (crying) (kisses) (radio chatter) Nick? Nick. What? This is Dr. Exner. Hi. I understand you may be in need of methadone. Well, I would love methadone if I was trying to kick, which I've already done. When's the last time you used? Uh, I don't know. When did the world end? Couple of days before that. What's this? Overdue house calls. I'm Dr. Exner. Oh, Travis. Can't tell you how happy we are to see you. Um, is something wrong with Nick? Nick :  No, I'm fine. But your ex-wife, man, she's a NARC. Told this lady I was the neighborhood dope fiend. (beeps) 98.6. I'm gonna check your blood pressure. So are you the one that decides who goes to this facility? Exner :  Well, I have some help, but, yes. Like Doug Thompson? I can't discuss other patients. Liza :  Excuse him. He worries about everyone else. Your friend is in good hands. Just like Hector Ramirez. Just like Griselda will be. You okay, Nick? Yeah. Uh, yeah, yeah. Is Mr. Ramirez okay? Congestive heart disease is manageable. Your heart rate's elevated. You're a very attractive woman. (objects tinkling) (exhales) Daniel :  Where did you go? Madison :  Outside the fence. What did you see? (door closes) Madison : Who is that? Daniel :  That's the doctor. She wants to take my wife and do surgery on her. Well, that's good. Tell me what you saw. Bodies. Yes. The infected. But... Go on. There was a man shot like the others, like the rest, but he-- he wasn't sick. And there were others like that. When I was young, these men-- these men were from the government. They came to our town and they took some people away. And my father was someone of certain importance in the community, so he went to speak to the captain and asked, "When will they return?" And the captain told my father, "Miguel, don't worry. They always come home." And they did. I was standing in the river fishing. Just a boy. And I found them. All of them. All at once. All around me. In the water. My father told me not to have hatred in my heart. He said that men do these things not because of evil. They do evil because of fear. And at that moment, I realized my father is a fool for believing there was a difference. If it happens, it will happen quickly and you must be prepared. Yeah, if what-- what happens? I must go with my wife. If I don't return, you will look after Ofelia for me. She's a grown woman. She doesn't need-- Please. You will look after Ofelia for me, please. Thank you. Keep your son close. (radio chatter) (tinkling) (items clatter) (sighs) What do you want me to say? You don't know. What? You have no idea. You have no idea. (panting) (crickets chirping) (radio chatter) Go away. You gotta leave. What the hell happened to your face? Knock, for Christ's sake. Go away! Stop, Nick, let me just have a look at it. Nick!  Let me in. What's going on? Let me in. (knocking) Nick. What happened? Travis, stop, look. Let me just... I got it, okay? Okay. Alicia :  Nick, he's gone. Come on, let me in.  (knocks) (sighs) Do you want me to get Mom? (sighs) Who did that to you? Are you okay?  Mm-hmm. You want to talk about it? Hey, hey, it's okay. It's okay. (sighs) It's okay. (breathing heavily) (vehicle approaching) (tires screech)  (doors open, close)  (brakes squeal) (men shouting) (speaking Spanish) (Griselda moans) (all speaking Spanish) Liza :  All right. This is good, this is good. Okay, come on. All right. Careful. Soldier :  Okay, let's go. (speaking Spanish) Liza :  Gentle. Hey, I don't know how long we will be. Soldier :  Let's go to your right. Okay. What the hell is going on? Liza : Gentle. Hey. Whoa, hey, hey. What's all this? If we don't get Griselda to the surgeon, she's gonna lose the foot. You're in the way. All right, okay.  All right, step. Good. (groans) Soldier :  Here we go. Lead on. Liza :  Okay. Sir, I'll need you to wait. Liza :  All right... No, that's okay. That's his wife. Come on, come on. (speaking Spanish) I have two names. Griselda Salazar, Daniel Salazar. No, not you. Nicolas Clark. What? Come on, man. Free medical, care of the US Military. Run. Travis :  Whoa, whoa, whoa. Hey! That's a mistake. No, no, that's a mistake. That's a mistake. Nick-- Alicia :  Wait. Hey! Hold on! Madison :  No, no, no! Take it easy. Take it easy. Back off, sir. Don't you hurt him. Stand down. Stand down, ma'am. Madison :  Nick! Come on. No, he's not sick. Calm down, ma'am. (speaking Spanish) (arguing) Hey, hey, hey! Hey! Travis :  Easy! Dad! Take it easy. Soldier : Step back. What are you doing? Take it easy, man! He's a kid! It's an old man and a kid. What are you doing? This is our home. Hey, I didn't do anything, man. I didn't do anything. Let Nick stay. He's not a risk. I'll look after him. Please. You said you wanted to help. Yeah. I do, yes, but-- Then get in the truck. We could use you in the hospital. He knows me, please. Just let me talk to Moyers. It doesn't matter. Travis :  Would you just let me talk to Moyers? No. No! No, Nick! Soldier :  We're set! Soldier #2 :  Convoy's moving out! I have a son. He needs me. We'll come back for your son. He's safe here for now. But Griselda, the others, they need you. I need you. You coming? Soldier :  Let's go! Soldier #2 :  What's the hold-up? Exner :  Liza. Soldier :  Get her up. Come on, lady. (mouths words) Soldier #2 :  Come on, lady. Are you coming or not? Mom? (whispers) Don't worry. All right, clear out. Chris :  Mom. Where is he? Where did you take him? Where is he? No-- Nick! Chris? Liza. She did this. Alicia's voice :  "Patrick, if you find this, I'm sorry. If you find this, I love you. I saw something today, something that horrified me. At first, I thought it was unnatural. I thought it was an aberration. But I was wrong. What I saw was prophesized. What I saw was godly. And I think it's overdue. I wish you were here, but I will see you soon. And you will hold me." (distant gunfire) Alicia's voice :  "If you find this, I am sorry." (gunfire continues) Alicia's voice :  "If you find this, I love you."
