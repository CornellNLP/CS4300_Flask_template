 Dice : Your aunt, she like brown? 
 Carmen : I'm pretty sure she can't even see. So, on what basis do we know she's gonna like the chair? That's why I don't think it really matters which one we get. I like it. Let's find a salesman. Okay. Excuse me? Oh, hey there. What's up? We're thinking about this chair over here. Can you tell me a little about it? Hold on a second. I mean, does it tell... I know who you are. You're the Dice Man! Yeah, how you doing? Dice Man! [laughs] No, I-I got to say, I don't know if this chair's fancy enough for you. I mean, I'm sure Mr. Andrew Dice Clay wants the most expensive chair in the store. Let me stop you there. The chair is not for me, okay? It's for her aunt, so... Say something funny. You know what, I think we're just gonna look around, okay? All right. I'll see you later. Really? Really what? We're gonna see each other later? You're kidding me, right? No. Okay, it was great to meet you. Bye! Yeah. I-I'll see you later. Look, we don't need help. We just need to buy a f*cking chair. I can't walk in a f*cking furniture store... Sorry! Hi. Sorry about what happened back there. Where's your bodyguard? I'm his bodyguard. You're his bodyguard? Look, pal, I know you got some kind of idea about who I am in your head, but things aren't like that. Yeah. But still, you shouldn't be out here all alone. I should be your bodyguard. You should be my bodyguard? I should be your bodyguard. Why? To protect me from people like you? Look, how about we fight? What? There's no one around. I'm the manager. We can do it right here. Look, I don't need any fights, okay? I don't want to fight with anybody. I just want to buy a f*cking chair. That's it. Okay, look, I-it doesn't have to be a fight. It could be a wrestling match. If I pin you, then I get to be your bodyguard. If you pin me, I'll give you a chair. I don't need a free f*cking chair. Listen, pal, I've had my ass kicked by some of the toughest guys you'd ever meet, and you're not one of those guys, okay? So do yourself a favor while you can and just walk the f*ck away! Oh, let's go. Let's do it, you f*cking asshole. Oh, you stupid f*ck! Come on, you pussy! What time's your aunt's party? We have time. Go ahead. Kick his ass. [Rock music plays] Oh! [Crowd chanting "Dice!] Top of the world, ma. Carmen : What do you want me to say, Andrew? You haven't been performing, and we're broke. I'll get back on stage, and I'll fix it. And besides, I got a meeting today. You have a meeting? With Marvin? Yeah, with Marvin. About a gig? I don't know. I haven't met with him yet. I'm telling you, Andrew, without this alimony, we wouldn't be able to pay for our cars. What are you talking about, alimony? Yeah, alimony. You still get alimony? Well, we're not married, so duh, I get alimony. What'd you think this check was every month? I don't care if we go homeless, I'm not taking another guy's money. Well, it's the law. Unless, you know, you want to get married. Come on, that's not even the point. What are you doing over here? All right. Well, until then, he pays for the cars. Wait a minute. Dr. Lowenstein is paying for my Denali? $538.58 a month. No man should ever pay for another man's Denali. But he is. All right. That's good. Because guess what, you got to drive me to my meeting. Your car doesn't work? As far as I'm concerned, I don't own a car anymore. So get your keys. I'll meet you at the front. Call Milkshake. He'll drive you. ♪ ♪ What are you doing writing? What are you writing while you're driving? I'm letting people know where I am. What people? I'm your only person. Other than me, you have no people. I got people. I got friends. That right? You think I'm a boring person? Well, there's some people that think you're a little boring, that's all. And what have you ever done that's so exciting? No, nothing. What have I ever done, right? Let's start with being an international superstar. Bringing Madison Square Garden to a decibel level of 12.6, .2, something like that, they told me. Hundreds and hundreds of millions of f*cking people coming to see me. I think that's a... hey. Hey, I didn't even tell you this. Recently, I'm not even f*cking around, they took one of my jackets. It's in the New Brunswick Hall of Fame. New Brunswick Hall of Fame is gonna take one of your jackets? What do you got against New Brunswick? Milkshake : What are you gonna say to this guy? It's not your job to know what I'm gonna say to him. It's your job to have my back. Well, am I... am I acting as your driver, or am I acting as your bodyguard? What's the f*cking difference? Well, I'd like to know what my role is, that's all. Just keep your eyes open. That's your role. That's your role. It affects what I get paid. What do you mean what you get paid? I employed you on a trial basis. This ain't about money. You ate half the candy in the car just coming over here, and you're asking me for money? You get other things. You get full access to me. You're my best friend. I got full access to you. All right. Big shot. Everybody's a big shot. Can I help you? Yeah, I'm here to see, uh, Doc Lowenstein. Do you have an appointment? No. Are you a new patient? No. Have you seen a dermatologist before? I suggest you just do what the man says. What... what are you doing? I'm keeping my eyes open. How is that keeping your eyes open? I don't know. Let me check with the doctor. This is some setup you got over here, huh? Lowenstein : Thanks. You got... you got to get, like, them brackets that you can stick, like, the chicks' feet through. Oh, I'm a dermatologist. We don't have those. [Chuckles] No, no, I know. Well, great to see you, Dice. Bit of a surprise, but, uh... So, how is Carmie doing these days? "Carmie." What kind of shoes are those? Oh, these are the Vibram Barefoot Sport Trek Five-Finger sandal. They were designed for nature walks, but they serve me well in the office here. Yeah, I get it. [Chuckles] Oh. Will you excuse me one moment? Don't ever tell anybody Carmen was married to such a tiny man. He is small. All right. Sorry about that. [Chuckles] So, what can I help you with? I don't want to take up a lot of your time, but, uh, you know, we want you to stop sending the alimony payments. The alimony. Yeah. To Carmen. Yeah. These are Carmen's wishes? Yeah. Well, I'm sorry, but I don't think I can do that. It would be against the law. He's a tiny man, but he plays hardball. It's not like that. I'm just not allowed to stop unless... did you two get married? Uh... uh, not the way you'd think. Like, a little different. That's not the point. Okay. Well, I'm sorry. I'm just not allowed to stop. It's against the law. Are you a dermatologist or a lawyer? He's a dermatologist. What, do you, like, got it out for me? I'm trying to take you off the hook here. What are you looking at me like? The f*ck is this about? What? What, do you want a piece of me? Is that it? Huh? How long have you had that thing on your neck? What thing? Just sit back down in the chair for me here. What is it? What are you talking about? We'll find out. [chuckles] No, I'm not good like this. [Machine hissing] Dice : Honestly, I mean, you're my manager,  and it's been a little quiet on your end. Quiet on my end? Yeah, quiet on your end of, like, the phone. Your phone's not ringing, my phone's not ringing. Neither one of our phones is ringing. But I know one thing. I got a call this morning. Good news. I got to hear some good news. I could use it. I got a phone call from Tony at the Tangiers casino. Tony at the Tangiers? Runs the whole goddamn thing. Books the big room. The big room at the Tangiers? Okay, they're talking residency. 200 nights a year, Dice. This is the kind of f*cking news I... dawg, this is... [chuckles] This is unbelievable, really. This is huge. This is huge. [motorcycle revs] And, Tony, Tony wants to meet with you. I get it. Wait. What the f*ck is this on the bike here? What the f*ck is that? I don't know. Hey, you... you want to meet with my security guy? No, no, no. I can handle myself. 'Scuse me. Oh! No f*cking pictures! What are you doing? Can I help you with something? What? What? Did this used to be a Circuit City? Yeah, yeah. It closed. Uh, there's a Five Guys a couple blocks down. You make a left on Rancho. Five Guys is a burger place. You mean Best Buy? Best Buy.

So, it's like a... is it a done deal? There was an incoming call. That's great. What is that? What? Incoming call? And incoming call, meaning they called me. They're looking for me. It gives me, like, some kind of leverage. I... look, I don't have all day to explain show business to you. You don't have to, buddy, I get it. It's an incoming call. It's like a formality or whatever. Exactly. It's done, you know what I mean? Great. When they want you, they want you. That's all. Dice : And then this guy, f*cking Dr. Lowenstein trying to get tough with me? I mean, it wasn't a problem. But I'll tell you the truth. I fixed everything. That man is out of our life forever. Except I got to back in two weeks for a follow-up. But after that, he's gone forever. What the f*ck, Andrew? That's a lot of money to give away for no reason. What are you worried about? We got the Tangiers. We don't got the Tangiers. We got a meeting at the Tangiers. How many times I got to tell you, it was an incoming call. An incoming call? Yeah. Let's just have the meeting first. Milkshake : Ha, ha! Why has Milkshake been on the couch all day? 'Cause he thinks he's the head of my security team, so... I don't have the heart to tell him to leave. [Knock on door] Chuckles : Take it easy, Tiger. I'll get it. Hey, Dice. Marvin. So, uh, Tony changed the meeting, and it's, uh, tomorrow at 7:30... 7:30? In the morning? A.M. 7:30 in the morning? Tony's got an early flight, so we have to do the meeting before that. But he can't get up that early. He's never woken up before noon in his life. I know. That's why I'm telling y'all. Just change the meeting. What's the big deal? Change the meeting. It was an incoming call. No, I can't just change the meeting. And it was an outgoing call. No, you told me it was incoming. It was actually an incoming call after I made the outgoing call. Are you f*cking kidding me with this here now? Hey, at least it's a meeting. Just go to bed early,  and then you get up and get that job, and you can make it rain, get the paper... All right. What are we really talking... so I'll go to bed early. I mean, come on.
