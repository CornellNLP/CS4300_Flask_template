 Dice : I was doing 80,000 seats a week... 80,000 seats. 
 When you reach that level of success, you know, it's... it's hard to stay there. 
 So when it got a little tough, I grabbed my girlfriend, Carmen, and my sons, and we moved to Vegas to make things a little easier. 
 But the shows... well, you know, that's not really happening right now. 
 You know what I mean? 
 So my only real source of income has been coming from gambling. 
 Long story short,  I need new windows, and... and I just don't have money to pay for them. 
 So you're saying you don't want to pay for the windows? 
 I'm saying I can't pay for the windows. 
 Because honestly, when you came through this door, I sort of felt like... like a friendship brewing between us, like immediately, just the way we said hello and I gave you that little hug. 
 Yeah, yeah. 
 You know, my... my friend here will vouch for me on that. 
 Right, Shake? 
 What he's trying to say is that sometimes people come here with celebrity prices on things like windows. 
 And what I'm saying, you know, is that  it doesn't have to be that way. 
 Let's put all that aside, okay? 
 Let's... Let's just get real for a minute, okay? 
 Let's pretend I'm not Andrew Dice Clay. 
 Who? 
 Andrew Dice Clay. 
 [Rock music plays] 
 Oh! 
 [Cheers and applause] 
 [Crowd chanting "Dice!"] 
 Top of the world, Ma. 
 [Chanting continues] 
 [Drums playing] 
 Babe, how's this sound? 
 I don't have time right now. 
 Do you like this dress? 
 Yeah, beautiful. 
 But do you like it better than this dress? 
 Babe, we're trying to do a thing here. 
 Stop with the drumming! 
 Are you f*cking kidding me right now?! 
 All right. I stopped. 
 I just came in here! I clearly have a question! 
 But I stopped! 
 You don't care at all! 
 I'm not doing anything! 
 You want to know what's bothering me?! 
 Am I hitting anything?! 
 Sorry. We were just into it. 
 You know what I mean? I-I care what's going on. 
 What's... What's the matter? 
 Okay, my brother's called me already five times today. 
 He's really upset. His wedding's falling apart. 
 Well, weddings can be very stressful. 
 The bakery got the date wrong. He doesn't have a cake. 
 He is so stressed, he's making me stressed. 
 Well, you know, honestly, he did it to himself. 
 How? 
 Well, I offered my help. 
 I mean, honestly, this wedding could have been one for the books, but he didn't want my help. 
 Are you being serious right now? 
 He's paying too much for the steak,  too much for everything. I could have got him a free deejay. 
 He didn't want it. 
 And on top of everything,  look at the sh1t linen fabric. 
 Oh, my God. Enough about the linen. 
 What do you mean enough about the linen? 
 It's coarse. It doesn't feel good on skin. 
 I mean, I could live with it, but it's nothing that... 
 Andrew, I don't give a sh1t about your feelings about linen, okay? 
 My brother wanted to plan his own wedding. 
 Get over it! 
 I mean, since when do you like weddings so much? 
 I thought you hated weddings. 
 Yeah, I hate weddings. 
 Marriage doesn't work. It's depressing. 
 If marriage doesn't work,  why are you so excited about this one? 
 Because this is a gay marriage. 
 Okay, so marriage between men and women don't work? 
 That's right. Think of all our friends, right? 
 Everybody's sitting on the couch the minute they get married, eating pretzels, watching reality shows. 
 All of a sudden, you forget why you even got together, and all the f*cking stops. 
 Not with gay marriage. 
 They're always happy. They're always dressed to the nines. 
 They're in top physical condition. 
 They're in Palm Springs three times a year, doing push-ups and sit-ups like Navy f*cking S.E.A.L.s. 
 And that's why the f*cking and sucking continues. 
 We have s*x all the time. 
 I know, but that's 'cause we're not married. 
 Dice : Why we got to be here so early? 
 I mean, the wedding's not until 6:00. 
 Well, I just want to help my brother set up, and then I want to get my hair done before the wedding. 
 Have you been listening to anything I've been saying all day? 
 Not the way you think. 
 What's that supposed to mean? 
 It means you're getting your hair done. 
 How excited should I be? 
 I don't need you to be excited. 
 I just need you to know the schedule. 
 Where's the gift? Did you bring a gift? 
 Babe, I'm not gonna go traditional. 
 What should I do, buy the guy a bowl? 
 I'm going with cash, $1,000 in an envelope, the right way. 
 We can't afford that. 
 We can't afford not to. 
 It's boomerang money. 
 Boomerang money? 
 Yeah. It comes back to us. 
 Oh, okay. So, then, when we get married, he's gonna give us 1,000 bucks? 
 No. Like, uh... like, on a birthday or something. 
 Relax. I'm just busting your f*cking onions. 
 [laughing] Yeah. 
 Babe, I-I know you got to be here early. 
 I get it. But why do I got to be here? 
 You're here so I know you're here. 
 So you know I'm here? 
 That's why you're here. 
 Carmen! 
 Oh, FYI, uh, brother's fiancé... not a fan. 
 Not a fan? 
 Hey! 
 Hey, Carmen! 
 [laughs] Hi. 
 Congratulations. 
 Oh, thank you. 
 Congratulations, yeah. 
 Are you guys feeling better? 
 Here you go. 
 Thanks. 
 Well, um, nothing has gone wrong in almost 20 minutes, so I'm feeling optimistic. 
 Hey, you know what? 
 Brides are always nervous on the day of. 
 It's gonna be okay. 
 Brides? 
 Well, you know, grooms. Y-y... 
 Yeah, it's okay. 
 No, no. 
 You... You may think it's okay, but this "bride" doesn't appreciate callous remarks like that from a man who refers to women by calling them "piglets." 
 Yeah, in my act, my stage performance, my comedy routine. 
 There's a big difference between Andrew, who's in front of you right now, and the guy onstage when I'm performing. 
 Oh, okay, well, if... if there is a difference, then why do you both dress in fingerless gloves? 
 Well, maybe we both share the same f*cking closet. 
 What's the bug up your ass? 
 What a coincidence. 
 Okay. 
 Yeah, what a coincidence. 
 I think... I think that everyone's on edge today. 
 Yeah. We're gonna go talk to the florist, okay? 
 Okay. 
 See you guys later. 
 Dice : Everybody's stressed out. 
 All right. We'll see you later. 
 Okay. 
 Yeah. 
 Can you believe that guy? 
 You still want to give him 1,000 bucks? 
 $1,000. We're gonna make it $2,000. 
 We're gonna teach them. 
 Okay. 
 I'm a good guy. 
 I know, honey. 
 Finally... 
 a real human being I can talk to. 
 Wait. Why is Milkshake here? 
 He's my plus-one. 
 You don't get a plus-one. You're my plus-one. 
 You really don't know how weddings work, do you?

 What are you drinking? 
 Gravy. 
 Gravy? 
 Gravy. 
 Are you kidding me? 
 I was hungry. I was at home. 
 I wanted some gravy, so I-I didn't have anything to put the gravy on. 
 I decided I'm gonna have a la carte gravy. 
 Why don't you just eat horse sh1t? 
 It's more chewy. 
 I like gravy. 
 I, you know, people say you're not supposed to drink it. 
 I'm like... f*ck them, you know? 
 I can't live by anybody else's rules. 
 I'm the one who has to die when it's my turn to die, so let me live my life the way I want to.

 What's the difference? You spilled it on the guy. 
 Don't you apologize? Don't you know how to do that?

 The ATM is charging a $5 fee. 
 Since when? 
 I don't know. 
 I ain't paying it. 
 It's like I'm tipping the machine. 
 You know, Dice, I was really hoping we could get something to eat... 
 You know what, Milkshake? You're drinking gravy. 
 You're drinking your "something to eat." 
 No, don't take the fee out on me. 
 I'm not taking it out on you. 
 We don't pay that fee. We're local.

 Hey, how you doing? 
 Guys like that pay the fee, not us.

 New casino policy on all the ATMs. 
 I get it. You didn't know about it. 
 That's annoying. 
 Annoying? 
 It's out and out disrespectful. 
 Disrespectful? 
 I mean, it's... it's a new policy. 
 You know, it's a processing fee. 
 I don't know what you want me to say about it. 
 I want you to say, "Forget about the fee." 
 You know I'm supposed to be out there, running this place, right? 
 Except I'm in here talking to you about an ATM fee. 
 Running the place? 
 I thought you were the floor manager. 
 All right, all right. Relax. 
 Brione took his time to talk to us, and we really appreciate that. 
 You know, I'm... I'm saying, you know, my time is as valuable as his time. 
 That's all I'm saying. 
 Look, I think we can all agree this is a waste of all our time, right? 
 Yeah, look, Brione, this is the bottom line. 
 You don't charge Dice a $5 fee. 
 That's for out-of-towners. 
 That's for Sam and June Snapfuck  from dipshit f*cking Iowa, never been off the farm their whole f*cking life. 
 They come to town. They walk the Strip with the giant glass with the beer,  looking, "Oh, look. There's Paris. 
 There's New York," right? 
 Next thing you know, he's dipping his balls in her mouth. 
 She never even makes it to the head of his cock before she falls asleep, but Sam don't care. 
 Sam don't give a f*ck. You know why? 
 Because he's been married to this broken-down valise for the last 27 years, and he'd pay that $5 fee  every day to get his sack wet like that. 
 And that's who should pay the fee. 
 Not Dice. 
 Not Dice.

 [Dice laughs] 
 That's a very compelling case. 
 Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. What are you doing? 
 Giving you the 5 bucks so... 
 What, give me charity? 
 Give it to the out-of-towners. 
 Just don't charge me. 
 It's all connected to the banks. 
 I mean, you know what I mean? It's like... 
 Let me say this again. 
 I'm Dice. I'm a living f*cking legend. 
 Yeah, Brione. He's a living legend. 
 He's Dice, all right? Dice is up here. 
 The fee is, like, down here... way down here, with the rats. 
 We don't have rats in here.

 You disappoint me, 'cause we're supposed to be friends.

 I don't think Sinatra back in the day was doing oxygen shots, you know?

 To go on that journey together. 
 Yeah, amazing. 
 I mean, come on. 
 Two guys getting gay-married by Liza Minnelli? 
 It's perfect. 
 It's not gay-married. It's just married. 
 Sorry. 
 fabulous grooms. Ladies and gentlemen, 
 I'd like to present to you David and Brandon, husband and husband! [laughs] 
 [Cheers and applause]

 [Microphone feedback] 
 Uh, excuse me, everybody,  if we could have a moment of your time. 
 Uh, David and I would just like to take a moment to say thank you to everybody for coming, and we especially want to thank my sister's boyfriend, Andrew, for ridding our wedding of all its bad luck. 
 Thank you so much. 
 [applause] 
 See? That is... 
 You did it. 
 I-I think they want me to say something. 
 No, I don't think so. 
 Babe, I give speeches for a living. 
 But they're giving a speech. 
 I go all over the world. 
 This... This isn't a show. 
 Babe, they're waiting for me. 
 No one's waiting for... 
 No, I got this. 
 - I got this, I got this. 
 Andrew. Sit down, sit down. Come here. Let me say something. Let me... I-I-I just need to say this, because this was just an incredible, wonderful day, a day that started out as a disaster, a day where there was more bad luck at a wedding than I've ever seen. Well done. You guys persevered, and now you're married. How does that feel, Brandon? You're married. You found the one cock in this world that you want to suck for the rest of your life,  the cock you love,  the cock you can hang out with, go shopping with,  walk the dog with, the one cock that... that makes you feel like you want to reach the goals in life that you want to reach. That's the cock you found. Now, I-I know maybe you guys have some kind of arrangement,  you know, like a lot of my gay friends do. And if... if that's the situation,  well, you know, good for you. But his is your number-one cock. This is your husband's cock. You know, Shakespeare once said, "A horse, a horse. My kingdom for a horse." They say that's the most beautiful phrase in the English language. But I say, "A cock, a cock. My kingdom for a cock" is the most beautiful phrase in the English language. So I say to you, Brandon, David, I wish you all the health, the happiness. And mazel tov! Mazel tov. Mazel tov. [Brandon laughs] Can I get a gin and tonic from somebody? [Cheers and applause] ♪ And the beat won't stop ♪ Hey, you guys having fun? Oh, it's such a beautiful wedding. Are you kidding? Oh, thank you. Congratulations, really, really. Thanks. Congratulations. And look, I got a little something for you... we do. Oh. There you go. Thanks for that. Thank you, both. No problem. And thank you for everything, Dice. No, you know what it is? I felt you guys really wanted me to say a little something, you know? No. No, not at all. She told me. It's all right. David : Hey, listen, Dice, um, I think I was a little hard on you because of your act. You know what? Forget it. Didn't you see me on "The View," where Barbara Walters hugged me? She knows I'm misunderstood. I mean, I love those broads. Forget all that. It's a wedding. What are we doing? Group hug. Get over here. [laughs] Come on, come on. Let's dance. What are we doing? [laughing] ♪ And the beat won't stop ♪ 
♪ ♪ Dice : That was so much fun. Get in the car. Come on. Stop playing around. Here you go, buddy. Thanks a lot. Thanks. Thank you. You have good night. Dice, I-I should let you know, it's, uh... it's another $5 to park valet now. But, uh, I'll take it out of this. It's okay. No, no, no, no. Don't insult me by saying you're gonna take it out. When did they start this? Eh, last month. Private events... they... they charge for valet now. Do you believe that? They want to charge a fee? Really, it's okay. It's no problem. No, it's the principle of the whole thing. No, I have $5 in my purse. It's fine. No, no, no, no. No, babe, it's the principle. I will be right back. I'll handle this. No, Andrew! Okay, can you just re-park the car, please? Sure. ♪ ♪
