 Previously on  Guilt... 
 Molly : Stop! 
 You know, there's something off about Grace Atwood. 
 Tech :  We found blood on the American girl's feet. 
 This is cutting a little close to home for you, huh? 
 What does that mean? 
 This isn't Ashington. 
 Donovan Trimbly. 
 What do you want? 
 Prince Theo :  You keep my secrets, I'll keep yours. 
 I thought we said we weren't gonna do this anymore. 
 It's a pretty interesting perspective, isn't it? 
 It's dead on. This has got to been taken from the same floor of the building directly across from them. 
 This could be their stalker. 
 It's just an old necklace of hers I found. 
 I don't remember Molly ever wearing this. 
 (muffled shout) 
 Gwendolyn :  Go back to Belfast. 
 If you can't agree to that, you're welcome to stay in London in a jail cell. 
 The only person I have in the world is you.

 Just going easy on you. 
 Hey, thank God, the royal wedding fever is keeping the paparazzi busy. 
 Yeah. 
 Grace : Luc's place is only a block away. 
 Race you. 
 (laughter) 
 You sure you don't want to come in, grab some water? 
 I should probably get back to the hotel. 
 Catch up on some work. 
 Don't forget to close the blinds, okay? 
 (camera shutter clicking) 
 What the hell do you think you're doing? 
 Hey! Let go. 
 Give me the camera. (groans) 
 Give it back. 
 Grace! Grace! 
 Call the police! 
 Grace. 
 I am the police, and you're under arrest for assault.

 What are you up to? 
 You look like death warmed up. 
 Big night? 
 Yeah, something like that. 
 It must have been. 
 You don't usually ignore my late night texts. 
 I wasn't ignoring. I was just busy. 
 Hmm. 
 Someone's being economical with the truth. 
 What's with the thong? 
 It was bothering me that Molly had so many posh things for a poor girl from uni. 
 I thought she might have a sugar daddy. 
 This little bit of lace and string cost 200 quid. 
 I tracked it to a boutique on Pont Street but, unfortunately, it was a dead end. 
 They had no record of who purchased it. 
 Well... this morning doesn't have to be a total bust. 
 The evidence room could be fun. 
 Pike's waiting for me. 
 Let him wait. 
 He's a patient man. 
 I've got to go. 
 I'm really sorry. 
 (whispers): Come on. 
 (phone rings) 
 (scoffs) 
 Can I just get five minutes? 
 Everything all right? 
 One of my investigators. 
 You will never guess who he's just arrested. 
 I met you at Luc Pascal's loft that night. 
 You're with the crown prosecutor's office, right? 
 That's right. 
 Then you have the authority to drop this completely unfounded assault charge. 
 I had a reasonable belief that that man meant my sister harm, meant me harm. 
 I don't know how you prosecutors do things in America, but over here we don't take kindly to people assaulting our officers. 
 Your officer was acting like a Peeping Tom. 
 I was protecting my sister. 
 I guess violence runs in the family. 
 Excuse me? 
 We really must stop meeting like this, Gwendolyn. 
 I agree. 
 I'll see you in court. 
 Great. 
 I can't wait to hear your investigator explain to the jury how he got his ass kicked by a woman half his size after he bashed her head into the wall, making her actions self-defense, so, yeah, looking forward to that. 
 I'll tell you what, while we're in court, why don't we go down to the civil division so we can take care of our personal injury suit? 
 How's your head there, Natalie? 
 It hurts quite a bit, actually. 
 Oh, please. 
 If you go after Natalie with this ludicrous charge, I will bury you in countersuits, and do not get me started on the complaints I could generate around this Beatrice Linley fiasco. 
 That has nothing to do with it. 
 You had this woman in custody, and then you let her walk back into the hospital to finish off her husband, and then go see Grace Atwood for a two-for-one. 
 Lady, I am gonna keep you so busy with my paper war, you are not gonna be able to prosecute a parking ticket, let alone the Molly Ryan case. 
 So, yeah, let's go to court 'cause that sounds like a hoot. 
 Enjoy this, because one day, your family won't be able to buy your way out of your problems. 
 Aren't you glad you didn't fire me? 
 They've got a whole team of investigators following Grace now. 
 Why are they gunning for her so hard? 
 They must have something on her that we don't know about. 
 I'm all over my Scotland Yard sources, I haven't heard anything. 
 I might have a source, too. 
 You're welcome.

 Luc, what's going on? 
 Did you do a line while I was in the shower? 
 I was up all night. I needed something, or I'll never finish these paintings in time. 
 You need to keep a clear head. 
 Now more than ever. 
 We both do. 
 I don't even know why I'm doing this stupid show. 
 That gallery's not interested in my art. 
 What are you talking about? 
 They called two days ago, Grace. 
 They know that's not enough time to produce quality work. 
 This isn't about me. 
 This is about Molly. 
 So? 
 Molly won't be any less dead if you don't do the show. 
 Grace. 
 No, I'm sorry. 
 It's about time something good happened. 
 So, if the gallery is using you for your art, use them... and the press, too. 
 Turn their spotlight from you to your art. 
 Your work is brilliant, Luc. 
 It deserves to be seen.

 You're late. 
 Before I give you these, I just need to know, am I covering up for a murderer here? 
 If the Prince of Wales had committed murder, do you really think you'd have found the body? 
 Okay, so he's the father of the baby then? 
 Ha, that makes sense. 
 That's why we didn't get a hit on the fetal DNA 
 'cause the royals aren't in the system, are they? 
 But then why have me do this? 
 It's not like we can match any bodily fluids Prince Theo left on these, anyway. 
 That was just a test. 
 You've passed, and now I've got a little job for you. 
 I need you to get a vial of Molly Ryan's blood. 
 To frame someone else. 
 I don't think so. 
 You didn't have a problem framing Donovan Trimbly, did you? 
 All right, that... was me doing what I had to do to stop a sick b*st*rd locking another kid in a basement and torturing him to death, all right? 
 You know how to close a case, and that is what we need you to do. 
 Find a solid suspect and wrap up this investigation before anyone traces Molly Ryan back to the prince. 
 You're going to have to find someone else to do your dirty work for you, I'm out. 
 That's a choice, but every choice has a consequence, doesn't it? 
 This one includes being arrested in front of your entire department and losing every quid you've got to civil suits. 
 Listen, if you were to expose me, every killer that I've ever put away could be released. 
 I mean, can you live with that? 
 Question really, is can  you  live with that? 
 Bruno :  Mrs. Harris, we know the photo had to be taken  from this apartment. 
 I don't know who could have taken it. 
 Do you live alone? 
 It's just me and my little boy. 
 Yeah, it's a shame about that girl. 
 You know, I did have some painters out here about a month back. 
 And I wouldn't have them back again, I'll tell you that much. 
 Shifty sorts. 
 Two weeks after they'd gone, I realized my Diamond Portrait Jubilee stamps had gone missing. 
 You got any contact details for them? 
 Um. 
 Let me see. 
 I might have... the receipt somewhere. 
 I'll track those painters down. 
 Could be one of them's got stalking on his resume, assaults on women. 
 House painting... that's a really good cover for a stalker when you think about it. 
 It gives you great access to... homes. 
 Um, I tell you what, mate, you, uh, you go on ahead. 
 I'll take care of this. 
 Sure. 
 Don't forget the golden rule. 
 The badge will get you women, but women, they'll get your badge. 
 I heard you did a real number on Officer Duncan. 
 Hey. 
 Hey. 
 You all right? 
 Yeah, not bad. 
 Maybe I should have let him toss me in the slammer. 
 Would have gotten me out of Grace's boyfriend's art show tomorrow night. 
 What are the odds he's actually any good? 
 Uh, a pint of ale for the lady, please. 
 Bartender : Gotcha. 
 Make it two. 
 Yeah, I-I don't think we should really be drinking together. 
 Who said we're drinking together? 
 We're just two people sitting at a bar. 
 Don't worry, I'll understand if you can't keep up with the American girl. 
 (chuckles) 
 Grace : Mm-hmm. 
 Hmm. 
 I'll hold your jacket. 
 No, it's fine, just take the picture. 
 Just give it, it looks awkward. 
 Okay. 
 Uncross your arms. 
 Come on, smile. 
 It's not every day your boyfriend gets his first solo exhibition. 
 Hashtag mindful moment. 
 There. 
 Now the bouncers will have to beat the crowd back tomorrow night. 
 (chuckles, speaking French) 
 Can I have my jacket back now? 
 Yes, let me just get my phone. 
 Luc? 
 It's just my emergency stash. 
 Seriously? 
 That's what you're going with? 
 You're hungry. 
 Let's get you something to eat. 
 Luc, you lied to me. 
 I said I'd lay off. I'm not using now, am I? 
 I don't even care about the blow. 
 You made me a promise, and you broke it. 
 You Americans are so dramatic. 
 Don't you turn this on me. 
 My entire life has been flipped upside down and set on fire. 
 And my life hasn't. 
 I thought I could trust you. 
 That... that you cared about me. 
 Grace. 
 If you can lie to me about that, then what else are you lying about? 
 Bruno : Oh, no, you're ruining them. 
 No, right that's it. 
 That is it. 
 (groans) 
 Try that. 
 Vinegar and mayonnaise? 
 That's genius. 
 (Bruno chuckles) 
 My dad gets credit for that one. 
 He would never, ever eat his chips without vinegar... and mayo. 
 Well, I guess he wasn't all bad after all. 
 You told me he was no prize. 
 You remember that? 
 I have a crazy good memory for conversations. 
 You do not want to get in a fight with me, 'cause I'll pull out crap you said months ago, and recite it back to you like a court reporter. 
 I bet guys really dig that, right? 
 Totally. 
 So your dad taught you about fries. 
 Excuse me... chips. 
 What else? 
 I guess you could say, he taught me what a hypocrite is. 
 Yeah, he was always going on about how, um... your word is your bond. 
 And integrity is everything. 
 Right up... I mean right up... until that moment where he just left me and my mum with nothing. 
 You're right, he does sound like a prize. 
 Hmm, yeah. 
 Natalie :  I guess some of what he said sunk in. 
 You seem like a man of integrity. 
 I'm sorry, um... 
 I was gonna do a whole thing here. 
 Try to flirt some information out of you about the Molly Ryan investigation. 
 Yeah, I wondered when we were going to come to that. 
 It was that obvious? 
 No, you were smooth. 
 You were really smooth, but, I mean, you know, all the bars in London, and you just happened to walk into the one right across the road from New Scotland Yard? 
 So let me just ask you straight out. 
 Why do you have a team of investigators following my sister? 
 Okay, those guys, they work for the crown prosecutor. 
 They're not mine. 
 So this is Gwendolyn Hall's personal witch hunt? 
 Whoa, I never said that. Nobody's on a witch hunt here. 
 Sitting across from her this morning, it felt pretty personal. 
 What does she have against my sister? 
 Gwen, she's just... 
 She takes her job very seriously, you know? 
 As I'm sure you do. 
 And... I need to get back to work. 
 And I will see you... around. 
 Prince Theo : Our way of life. 
 Our lives themselves. 
 The brave soldiers who made the ultimate sacrifice for this great nation. 
 On behalf of the queen, I dedicate this beautiful park as a living monument to their selfless, heroic actions. 
 (applause) 
 Did our friend deliver? 
 He did. 
 But he's proving to be slightly more rebellious than we'd hoped. 
 You misjudged him. 
 Didn't you? 
 You said we could control him. 
 But now there's yet one more person who can ruin me. 
 Don't worry, Your Highness. 
 He just needs to be properly motivated. 
 See to it. 
 (quietly): Oh, my God. 
 (door slams) 
 (sniffling) Hey. 
 What's the matter? 
 Have you been crying? 
 Luc and I got into it. 
 I don't want to talk about it. 
 Are you sure? 
 What are you doing? 
 Oh, I'm just, uh, finishing up some research for work. 
 I think I found what I need. 
 (phone buzzing) 
 It's him. 
 He's actually calling? 
 Not texting? 
 He must be really sorry. 
 Yeah, well he should be. 
 (phone beeps) 
 Luc : Grace, before I met you, no one had ever looked at my art. 
 Had ever looked at me as if I mattered. 
 I love you, baby, and I will do whatever it takes to make you trust me again. 
 I've been working on a surprise for you. 
 But you can only get it if you come to the show tomorrow. 
 
 
 
 Bruno : Comfortable, eh? 
 D. S. Bruno? 
 Bruno : Yeah. 
 We're with Internal Affairs. 
 Mind if we have a chat? 
 Sure, want to take me in a box? 
 No need. 
 We're simply doing a department audit of the Donovan Trimbly case. 
 Oh, yeah, yeah. 
 There a problem? 
 Hopefully not. 
 Just need you to take a look at your evidence reports. 
 Make sure you've crossed all the "T"s, dotted the "I"s. 
 So nothing comes back to bite the department. 
 Can you review it by day's end? 
 Yeah, sure.

 If anyone asks, you didn't see me. 
 I'm not supposed to be in London anymore. 
 What did you do? 
 A load of nothing. 
 Put it this way, I'm no closer to finding out who killed Molly. 
 Police have got jack-all on this, and you think you're going to solve it yourself. How? 
 If Molly's friends were anything like Molly, they don't go telling everything they know to the police. 
 Like I bet that you know who she was shagging, don't you? 
 No. Molly was away from home for the first time in her life, she wasn't exactly going steady. 
 What about the night she died? 
 She was here. Was anybody bothering her? 
 Not that I saw, but I was working. 
 It was Molly's. 
 You got to know something. 
 You're her roommate. 
 Look, I wish I could help. 
 I don't have a clue who did this. 
 Whoever killed her deserves to rot in hell. 
 (sighs) 
 I'm sorry, Molly. 
 (syringe piercing skin) 
 (club music playing) 
 You keep dancing like that, people are gonna think this music is good. 
 Is that an Irish brogue I hear? 
 Belfast. 
 I'm from Hillsborough. 
 I wish I'd spent more time getting to know my neighbors. 
 (Haley laughs) 
 Did you ever go skinny dipping at that hole in Ballyskeagh? 
 I still have a scar from the bloody barbed wire fence. 
 Woman : There you are! 
 Ah. 
 - Slainte. 
 Slainte. (both grunt) I like your necklace. I knew a girl who had one just like it. Oh, did you now? And did you, um, get along well with her? Well enough. She was my sister. Your sister had... this necklace? Yes, she did. Ah. What's it mean? We got to go. Um, I have-I have to go, sorry. Wait, just... can't it wait? I just want to talk. I can't. Tell me about the necklace. I'm sorry. Good morning, I was hoping I could have a word with you. I don't remember seeing your name on my calendar. I just want to say I know the pressure you're under with such a high profile case. I'm sure you just want to get this right. That's why it'd be a shame if... with everyone's eyes on you, you got this all wrong because of your bias against my sister. Bias. What could I possibly have against your sister? I don't even know her. No, you don't. But you think you do, because of what happened at Ashington Prep. You were a scholarship student at that fancy boarding school. You must have been desperate to fit in. Is that why you didn't stop those rich girls from dragging poor Jenna Dale into the woods and beating her to death? I want you to leave this office. Right now. I understand, Gwendolyn... you were young, and you tried to make it right by telling the police what you saw, but those girls' parents used their influence to make the whole thing go away, and now you think my sister and I are doing the same thing. Aren't you? I'm not Stan. I'm not going to threaten you with malicious prosecution or some smear campaign in the press, but if you continue to pursue Grace to the exclusion of all other suspects, I'll do whatever I have to do to protect my sister, and I won't stop until she's safe and sound. Not a day goes by when I don't think about Jenna. That I don't wish I'd done something to stop those girls. It's why I became a prosecutor, and I will never let another injustice go unpunished on my watch. Never. You know what? Maybe you're right. Maybe I have let my past cloud my judgment when it comes to your sister, but you have to admit that there are some objective facts that look really bad for Grace. Maybe she has some great explanations that will clear everything up, but I haven't heard them because she's been hiding behind Stan Gutterie. If this was your case, would you, honestly, clear her without speaking to her first? Would you let her leave the country? Probably not. So how about this? You let me speak to Grace, and if I hear what I need to hear, you can take her home. (door beeps) What are you doing here? I wasn't done with our conversation. How did you even find me? I tracked you with my phone. You planted that on me last night. I didn't have time to think of a better idea. I can't talk to you. Says who? That bouncer? Roz? I just want to know about the necklace, and then I'll get out of your hair. You got spooked when you heard my sister had it. Why? Some things are better left unanswered, okay? I need to know. Whatever it is. My sister is dead. I wasn't there to protect her from the b*st*rd who butchered her, and I have to live with that. All I want now are some answers. So I can get Molly some justice. So I can get her some peace. Please. (clears throat) The necklace is from a place where we work. A special club... where anyone with enough money can... have whatever they want. No. No, you're lying. You're lying. She wasn't... She'd never. She was a good girl. It doesn't make her a bad person. Okay, it's just something she did. And it's a lovely place, and we make really good money, and they take really good care of us. Stop it. She was nothing like you. I'm not doing it. Would you just listen to me? You've never been a murder suspect. Settle down, ladies. You have no idea what it's like to be on the other side of that table. Twisting everything you're saying. Trying to trip you up. I'm not going back in there. You're right. I have no idea what that must feel like. But you have to know I wouldn't ask you to do this if I didn't think it would set you free once and for all. Allow us to finally go home. You never want me to talk to anyone about anything, ever. Tell her this is stupid. N-Normally I would tell you to keep your mouth shut. You're on her side? I don't like to live in the dark, you know? My guess is Gwendolyn is cooking something up. I like to look at the menu before I get the bill. But don't worry, unlike your last round in the ring, I'm gonna be in your corner this time. Oh, working half-day now? I had a late night. Ran down our second painter, he's not our perp. He was away with his family in Brighton the night Molly Ryan was killed. Well, our mystery stalker might be moot, anyway. Check out what came back when you was having a lie-in. Whoa. Yeah. Grace Atwood's coming in this afternoon to speak to Gwendolyn. Gwendolyn? What? This is our investigation. This... we should have the first crack at her. Oh, believe me, I reminded her that we haven't handed this case off to the crown prosecutor, yet. But Gwen said she was the one who sweet-talked the sister into bringing her in. And we already had our crack at Grace, and we got nowhere. Well, you know what, maybe if we'd had this bombshell, it would have been a different story. I didn't care about Professor Linley anymore. By that time, I was already dating Luc, anyway. Gwendolyn : Luc, that's right. Seems like you're pretty smitten with him. Are there any questions here, or are you just hungry for a little girl talk? Just an observation. I love Luc, if that's what you mean. Okay, then. I don't mean to be callous, but we have a video of Luc and Molly, from the night that she was killed. The lap dance. Yeah, I know about it. It was nothing. It was just Molly being silly and Luc playing along. So, you and Molly never fought about Luc? Nope. Not that night? Not ever. She's painting her into a corner. Did you and Molly fight about anything that night? No, I swear. We never fought. Then why did Molly have your blood and skin cells under her fingernails? There are a million reasons why Grace's DNA could've been under Molly's nails. There aren't a million reasons why Grace's blood was under Molly's nails. There's only one reason that I can see, Molly fought back when you came after her with that knife. When you were killing her. Gutterie : We're done. You've had your fun. Come on. Get up. Let's go. Grace. No, I... Gutterie : Shut up. Not another word. Let's go. Grace, Stan's right. Gwendolyn : You want to tell your side of the story, clear your name. I'm listening, Grace. Talk to me. Grace, come on. We're going. Come on. No. You both made me come here, just let me talk. I didn't do anything wrong. It's not what you think. Then by all means, illuminate me. Earlier that night... the night Molly died... Molly pierced my belly button. You're quick on your feet, aren't you? I'm not lying. I have proof. (scoffs) Did you see her?! Flashing her belly button like it was spring break. That girl thinks she's entitled to get away with murder! I think she had a pretty solid explanation, Gwen. A little too solid. You know, she... she must've known why we were bringing her in. Went out, got a piercing to cover her tracks, but how? How did she know? (whispering): How did she know? You. You tipped off the sister, didn't you? We've all had a long day, so I'm gonna pretend you didn't just question my integrity. I saw you with her yesterday at lunch. You two looked pretty cozy. Okay, that is called working a source. All right? And this whole thing, this is total bull... Then look me in the eye and tell me that your handling of this case has been completely above board. I want to... I want to catch Molly Ryan's killer just as much as you do. I don't know what's going on with you, Alex, but I cannot let it affect this case. I'm sorry. You're off the investigation. Whoa, you can't do that. This is... this is my case. No, this is  my  case. The detectives who work it serve under the discretion of the crown prosecution, and I no longer require your services. ♪ I could be ♪
