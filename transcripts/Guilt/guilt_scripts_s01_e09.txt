 Previously on  Guilt... 
 Scotland Yard executed an  arrest warrant for Grace Atwood in the murder of Molly Ryan. 
 You'll be safe here while you're healing up. 
 Did they...  ask you anything about that night? 
 It's our secret. 
 You couldn't help Molly that night, but you can help her now. 
 Prince Theo killed Molly. 
 Jessica Marshall was a client, which is how she wound up on Molly Ryan's phone the night she went missing. 
 I'll bet someone paid a pretty penny for that painting. 
 You think we could trace it? 
 You tried to frame me. 
 Bruno :  Well, you wanted me to frame someone, didn't you? 
 I've got a witness, Your Highness. 
 He saw you kill Molly Ryan. 
 You leave me no choice, Detective, but to inform Internal Affairs about how you planted evidence on Donovan Trimbly. 
 You don't get to touch me, not ever again. 
 Put me on the stand. I want to testify against Prince Theo. 
 I know a way to finish what our fathers started,  to remind England that we haven't forgotten everything the Crown's taken from us. 
 This'll do. 
 Are you sure you have the stones for this? 
 He killed my sister.

♪ Like you're some inspiration ♪

 Any lipstick on my teeth? 
 Man : Veena, you look great. 
 Okay. All right, why don't you move the camera over here. 
 That looks good. 
 Okay, we're good to go. 
 Streaming in three, two, one. 
 Nine weeks from the day she was arrested in her posh West End hotel,  Grace Atwood will finally go on trial for the murder of her flatmate, Molly Ryan. 
 Crowds have already started to gather for one of the most highly anticipated murder trials in recent memory, with opening arguments scheduled to begin in a few short hours. 
 There's probably no one more anxious to get these proceedings underway than Grace Atwood herself. 
 I know the real question on many of your minds is: what will Grace wear to court today? 
 Well, my sources tell me to expect something fab yet conservative. Mom got this for me when I graduated from law school. It's always been good luck for me at trial. ♪ For disaster... ♪ Veena :  Ms. Atwood is in good hands with Attorney Stan Gutterie, the brash Yank who has yet to lose a case. Of course, there's a first for everything. And if Gutterie wants to maintain his perfect record, he's going to have to contend with what's said to be a mountain of evidence against his client. That's not to say the prosecution will have an easy time of it. In addition to recent revelations of Molly Ryan's involvement with The Courtenay s*x club scandal, Prosecutor Hall must also contend with lead investigator DS Alex Bruno's abrupt departure from the force, after it was discovered that he planted evidence in the case of alleged child killer, Donovan Trimbly. Because of Bruno's actions, Trimbly's conviction has been appealed, and is expected to be overturned. With the Grace Case garnering international attention, all the world will be focused today on London's Old Bailey Courthouse and the alleged killer, Grace Atwood. An impartial jury must decide the question weighing on all of our minds. Is Grace guilty or innocent? Court is now in session. Hey, everyone! Molly Ryan here. Just wanted to let you all know this will be my last post for a while. I'm officially done with my London travel videos, because... I'm here to stay. I've decided to make London my permanent home. I'm really sorry, Mum. (laughs) I'm sure one day I'll look back at this with my kids, and we'll laugh our heads off at my bonkers-looking hair. But I'll tell them that was one of the happiest days of my life. (giggles) Gwendolyn : Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, this video was taken on March 21st, the day Molly bought a pregnancy test from her local chemist. A bright, young university student with a promising future. A girl filled with optimism and hope. ... who ran in unsavory circles, where s*x and drugs and even murder were commonplace. The defense is gonna try and distract you with scandal, innuendo, but we're not here to prove if Molly Ryan was a virgin or a saint. None of that matters. What matters is... Molly was having an affair with a very powerful, self-indulgent and reckless man who got her pregnant. A man who had everything to lose if that child were born. This case comes down to one simple notion: you find the daddy, you find the baddy. Unfortunately, the authorities, they cannot find him. But I did. We have Molly's murderer in custody. She's sitting right there. Now, folks, I am no scientist. But I do know that a woman cannot get another woman pregnant. (quiet laughter) Ergo, Grace did not make a baby with Molly. But we have a witness who puts the father at the scene of the murder. Grace Atwood has a documented history of lashing out in jealous rages. Ladies and gentlemen, I'm confident you will find Grace Atwood... ... did not, would not and could not have murdered her best friend. Court is adjourned until tomorrow. Well, it's the wig, right? You jealous you don't get to wear one? Could never pull it off quite like you do. (knocking on door) (Pike sighs) Civilian life's still treating you well? I've seen every rerun of  Ripper Street. Getting to drink more though, that's for sure. All alone, one-star motel. Glamorous, mate. Would you rather I was back in my flat with a bullet in my head courtesy of Her Majesty's Secret Service? You sure you want to do this? What, the lamb curry? It's not that spicy, is it? Prince Theo killed Molly, Pike. I'm not just gonna let him walk  and  put an innocent girl in jail for it. Okay, I get it. But what you got to remember, Bruno, you're a disgraced cop now. You get up on that stand and you tell those people that their beloved prince is a killer, they're not just gonna think you're a nutter, they're gonna hate you. With a passion. Well, they can't hate me any more than I hate myself. A child killer is going free because of me. I'm sure as hell not letting another murderer get off. I told you, I-I saw him from my window. And how did you know it was Prince Theo? Because he's the prince. My mum has a plate with his bloody face on it. Neville, remember what I told you. Don't use the word "bloody." Just try to keep your cool. I-I don't want to practice anymore. Well, we have to. The prosecutor's gonna be a lot tougher on you than I am. I'm not gonna testify, then. Neville... No, they're gonna call me mental. In front of everyone. Remember why you're doing this. You're the only one who can stop the prince from hurting anyone else. Molly would want that. Wh-What if I'm too nervous? When I'm nervous, I can't talk. Well, if you're nervous, look at me. I'll be right there in front of you. Every step of the way. I'm sorry. Visiting hours are over. You'll do fine, Neville. Will you come visit me tomorrow? I'll come visit you every day until you testify. I promise. (chuckles softly) ♪ ♪ Thought you could hide, did you? Who's hiding? Fancy a drink, mate? Crushed ice, cubed...? I'm afraid a drink isn't gonna make this go away, Bruno. (train horn blows) Reporter :  Prince Theo will be dedicating the new neonatal wing at the Royal Children's Hospital in Hackney next Friday. The ribbon-cutting ceremony is open to the public. Kaley : Hello! You're back early! (chuckles): Hello. How's my favorite waitress? Good. How are you? I, um, got something I want to show you. Mm, so do I. (chuckles) Not that. Look. Australia? Yeah. It's warm, like, all year-round. I want to move there, Patrick. With you. Just put London behind us. No, come on, we don't have that kind of money, Kaley. Not even close. Why do you think I'm serving fish and chips all day? You know what the first thing we do is when we get to Sydney? Surf lessons. (both laugh) You're mad. That's why you fancy me. Mm. Kaley : See? Aren't you glad you didn't go after the prince? It's so clearly obvious this Grace girl did it. You would've done in an innocent man. You're right. I'll see ya after my shower. Mm, mm, mm, mm, mm... (laughs) Wait. After my shower. You're a hard man to track down, Patrick. Well, been laying low. Staying out of trouble. If you wanted to stay out of trouble, you'd have gone back to Belfast. The deal we made, remember? I'd have you thrown in jail on that assault charge if you didn't leave London. Are you gonna arrest me? I'm tempted. Very tempted. (sighs) I need you in court. Molly deserves to be represented by a member of her family. And since your mother is too sick to travel, that job falls to you. You got the wrong person. Grace Atwood did not kill my sister. Then tell me who you think did, because I've got more evidence against her than I know what to do with. Hello. I get why you stayed in London. I'll see you in court tomorrow. Your security detail's been set for the ribbon cutting ceremony on Friday. You'll have plenty of time before the state dinner with the prime minister. Very well. You can't be serious. I haven't rung the girl once. You said you were done. I am. Your Highness, these... compulsions of yours, they only lead to trouble. You have to try to keep them in check. So you're my psychiatrist now? I didn't say that. And don't ever... tell me how to behave, Phillip. (crowd clamoring) As opinions run hot outside the courthouse, the jury is still focused on Gwendolyn Hall as she begins her second week presenting the Crown's evidence. The jury's already seen Grace's DNA under Molly's fingernails and the gruesome crime scene photos, including Grace's feet stained with Molly's blood. Today, they get something much easier on the eyes. Grace's ex, Luc Pascal. Is that you in the video with Molly, Mr. Pascal? Molly was drunk. I went along with it. It didn't mean anything. Gwendolyn : Did Ms. Atwood witness this lap dance that didn't mean anything? Luc : Grace didn't kill Molly. She wouldn't hurt her! She wouldn't hurt anyone! Gwendolyn : You didn't answer my question, Mr. Pascal. Grace, I love you. Judge : Please don't address the defendant, Mr. Pascal. Gwendolyn : I have a statement here that you gave to police on April 9th of this year. Is that your signature? Yes. Can you please read the last line, which I have indicated in brackets? "It must have been about 2:00 in the morning. Grace went downstairs to use the bathroom. She was gone for over an hour." I swear, Grace, they twisted my words. I didn't mean that... Judge : If you don't restrict yourself to answering the questions put to you, I will find you in contempt. Gwendolyn : We can all see how much you care for Ms. Atwood. You don't want her to go to prison, do you? No, because she didn't... You would do anything to make sure she goes free. You'd even keep her darkest secret, wouldn't you? No, that's not true. Really? Do you recall a conversation that you had with the defendant when she visited you in custody on April 8th? No, I don't remember. Let me refresh your memory. Grace (recorded) : Did they... ask you anything again about that night? About us? Luc (recorded) : No. I wouldn't say anything if they did... you know that. Grace : No one can know, Luc. Ever. Luc : No one will ever know. No one except you and me. It's our secret. All right, I object. I'm sorry. A nine-year-old with a laptop could splice this together. Judge : Mr. Gutterie, I ruled on this in pretrial and I haven't wavered. It's admissible. Gwendolyn : Is that you and Grace in the audio recording, Mr. Pascal? Yes, but it's not what it sounds... No further questions. Tough day, was it? Can't imagine it's easy. Sitting up there, listening to all that crap they say about you. I used to think if I was innocent, that a jury couldn't find me guilty, but now... I don't know. Well, if it makes you feel any better, I don't think you did it. Do you want to come to court tomorrow and tell the jury that? I look like a fancy lawyer to you? You got Stan Gutterie. You hardly need me. You read up on everyone you drive to trial? Just the nice ones. Nice, huh? No one's called me that in a long time. Hey, can I ask you a favor? Depends. I was wondering if... if you could put on some music. Feels like I haven't heard music in a really long time. Music? That I can do. ♪ Just let go ♪ 
♪ Oh, oh, oh-oh, oh ♪ 
♪ Oh, oh-oh ♪ 
♪ Just let go ♪ 
♪ We rise... ♪ 
♪ Together. ♪ What's going on? You need to stay back. Is Neville okay? Please, stay back! (gasps) If I'd just let Neville be, if I hadn't manipulated him into testifying, he'd still be alive right now. There is a time and place for guilt. This is not one of those times. That kid was locked up in a psychiatric ward. He's been battling demons his whole life. Finally the demons won. No, I don't buy it. Neville wasn't despondent. He wasn't depressed. He wasn't a suicide, Stan. I think the prince had Neville murdered, and we should get it out into the press immediately. Oh, well, there's a good idea. Plant a conspiracy theory that will be instantly ridiculed, so when we actually do have to present it in court, it will have zero credibility. No, we play this card at the right time, and that is in trial. I think we should put Roz Walters on the stand. Have her tie the prince to Molly. Sure, the madam with the criminal history. What about Grace? She's been begging us to let her testify. Maybe we should reconsider. She could say she saw the killer at the scene of the murder. Oh, you-you mean the faceless killer that she saw under hypnosis. Your idea. (sighs) Come on, no one's gonna buy that. Besides, that opens her up for cross-examination. You know this. Nat, we have our witness. The detective ready to finger that perverted prince for once and for all. What we have is a crooked cop who the jury is not gonna like. With that smile and those baby blues? Natalie, we want him to admit that he was corrupt, that he was forced to alter evidence by the prince of Wales, Molly Ryan's favorite Courtenay client. And once that genie is out of the bottle, this trial's as good as over. At this time, I would like to call former Detective Sergeant Alex Bruno to the stand, please. Is it true that you were recently sacked from Scotland Yard? Yes. Did your firing have something to do with violating protocol while investigating a previous case? Yes. Gutterie : I must say, Mr. Bruno, I applaud your courage in coming forward and admitting this. That takes character. I object. Counsel's testifying. Sustained. Gutterie : Let's talk about the Molly Ryan case then, shall we? During the course of the investigation, did you ever act in a manner that violated protocol? I'd like to invoke my right not to incriminate myself. Gutterie : Let me rephrase the question. Did you ever tamper with any evidence in the Molly Ryan case? I invoke my right not to incriminate myself. Mr. Bruno, did you not, at the behest of a third party, alter evidence in the Molly Ryan case? Gwendolyn : I object! He's leading the witness. Judge : Sustained. Gutterie : Is it true that you were contacted by a powerful client of Molly Ryan's from The Courtenay s*x club who blackmailed you into corrupting evidence in order to obfuscate his guilt? Gwendolyn : Objection! Argumentative. Judge : Sustained. Gutterie : What was this man's name, Mr. Bruno? Was it... Mr. Gutterie, that's enough. Strike that from the record. I'm... done with this witness. Good afternoon, Mr. Bruno. Thank you for your time today. During the course of this investigation, did you have sexual relations with the defendant's sister, Natalie Atwood? (gallery gasps) Gutterie : I object. Irrelevant, inflammatory and highly inappropriate. Gwendolyn : Your Honor, the defense has implied that former DS Bruno's actions hurt their client. I'm simply trying to establish that, if anything, the detective would be biased towards helping her. I'll allow it. Gwendolyn : Mr. Bruno, did you have s*x with the defendant's sister? Yes. (gallery murmuring) That did not influence... No further questions. (panting) 
 
 Smart move staying hush, mate. I don't feel very smart. Yeah, well, I've got something that might cheer you up. Remember that painting in the photo of Molly and the missing woman, Jessica Marshall? Yeah, well, the artist was famous. It sold at auction in 1998, and it's been hanging on the wall of a Hertfordshire estate ever since. Hertfordshire? Prince Theo told me he met Molly Ryan in Hertfordshire. You think that's a coincidence? What if he had something to do with Jessica Marshall's disappearance? We need to get down to that estate, have a look around. Some of us have got a job, mate. I'm working a homicide in Tottenham. (phone rings, vibrates) Hold on. I've got to take this, sorry. Yeah. Hey. Hey! You were the one who came to Gutterie begging him to put you on the stand. What the hell happened up there? What kind of game are you playing? I thought you cared about the truth. Justice. Putting away killers so they don't kill again. That is why I kept my mouth shut. If I'd have... If I'd have testified against the prince, they would've killed you. You don't believe that Neville committed suicide any more than I do. I couldn't take that risk with your life. Alex, you can't let him get away with murder. No, I don't intend to. I'm going to Hertfordshire. I've got a lead. Well, I'm coming with you. What about the trial? Stan has the courtroom covered. If there's evidence that can exonerate Grace, I'm not gonna sit around and wait for it to show up. I'm gonna help you find it. I've been spat at, vomited on. (music playing) I've even had feces thrown at me once. That's disgusting! Why do you do it? I mean, you're a smart guy. There are a lot of other things you could be doing. Pays well. Good benefits, pension. Yeah, but it's not what you want to do. What do  you  want? Me? Yeah? (chuckles) Well, this is gonna sound a little odd, so don't laugh, please. But I'm quite keen on horses. I grew up on a farm in Lincolnshire, rode and took care of them as a lad. I could see myself as a stablehand, horse groomer, you know, that sort of thing. Told you it was odd. Grace : No, it's not odd at all. You know what'd be really odd? If you made a right turn here instead of a left. What would happen? How long before they came looking for us? So that's what this is all about. Trying to sweet-talk me into helping you make a run for it. Not very original, Grace. Fifth inmate this month. (laughs) Oh, my God, you should see the look on your face. You thought I was serious? Fell for that one. All right, you got me. (door closes) As you know, our key witness died before he had a chance to testify. My condolences. Thank you. And we believe that his death was not a suicide, but rather a homicide. What? Your Honor, the coroner ruled the death a suicide. Decedent has a history of depression. His own father hung himself when the boy was eight. Regardless of Madam Prosecutor's callous attitude, we would like to present a new witness. You want to call the prince of Wales as a witness? It's a stretch, Gutterie, even for you. Gutterie : With all due respect, Your Honor, he may bleed royal blue, but he is intimately involved in this case. A fair and thorough defense of my client depends on this testimony. Rubbish! Just another one of his wildly inappropriate distractions. Ms. Hall is right. You will not turn my courtroom into a circus sideshow. Is that clear, Mr. Gutterie? I... I'm sorry, Your Honor, I-I don't understand why this witness is being summarily denied because of his bloodline. Counsel, are you questioning my authority? No, I am not, Your Honor; I am questioning your impartiality. Has the Royal Family approached you? 'Cause if that... One more word, and I will hold you in contempt. If fighting for a fair trial... Is that clear? All right, then if, um, I may, uh, perhaps you can grant me a brief recess so I may find another witness, one that the prosecution will not object to. Roz :  I told you. I'm not testifying. That was before you heard my proposition. We've evened the score, Gutterie. I gave up The Courtenay for you. Sacrificed my livelihood. Your "livelihood." Your true calling is not whoring out hotties, you're DJ Rozzie Roz. I heard you spin. You got the talent, you certainly got the look. All you need is the break. And I'm just the guy to make it happen for you, in the home away from home for Tiesto, for David Guetta... Las Vegas? I'm talking "Roz Vegas." Former client of mine just opened up the brand-new hot spot on the Strip. He's eternally grateful for me keeping his ass out of prison. In exchange, he's agreed to book you for a four-month stint in his rooftop club. All you got to do is tell the jury the truth. Prince Theo was shagging Molly Ryan, and he wasn't too happy about the little prince sprouting in her belly. You must be pretty desperate. Having to bribe me. Technically, that's not a bribe. It's still dangerous. Luc : Roz. If this can get Grace off, you have to try it. You ought to listen to Drugstore Cowboy over here, 'cause he's right. (sighs) Man : I don't have time for this. That went well. Cheeky bugger. If I'd had my damn badge, he would've talked, that's for sure. Where are you going? Hello. Really nice hedge work. "Takes an artist to tend a garden," that's what my dad used to say. And this place needs to look good with all the parties they throw here, right? Was a wedding last weekend. Some bloke got sick out here, all over the gardenias. Can I talk to you about a woman who was at a party here last November? She hasn't been seen since. Bruno : Her name's Jessica Marshall. What are you, the police? Do you have any siblings, sir? Brother or sister? One of each. Why? My sister, my little sister, is on trial for a murder she didn't commit. And the disappearance of that woman could be a clue that could help her. So, please, if you can help us. Malcolm : Bloody hell. Do you know her? Do you recognize this woman? Follow me. Bruno : It's an exact match to Jessica's earrings. Found it after one of them strange parties. How was it strange? Well, first off, there was security everywhere. Blokes in suits, earphones in one ear. Covered up the windows. God knows what they were doing inside. Where exactly did you find that? In the South Garden, back in the woods. And when was that? Last November, just after Saint Andrew's Day. That's two days after she went missing. I'm calling Pike. Reporter :  Prince Theo will be arriving at the hospital  in the next 30 minutes, and we will break to coverage as soon as it begins. This is CNB News. Stop. Uh, street's closed, mate. Turn it around. I'm just picking up my little sister from the hospital. She's being released now. You'll have to wait until after Prince Theo's appearance. Sir, she's nine years old. She got hit by a bus in Battersea last week. Broken leg, punctured lung. Bloody bus drivers. Sir, she's waiting for me. I'll-I'll be five minutes. All right. Make it quick. Aye. Gutterie : Ms. Walters, did you and Molly both work at The Courtenay Club? Yes. Where she was a prostitute, correct? Yes. Gutterie : And what was your position there? I worked in the accounting department. Must be good with numbers. Ms. Walters, did you have access to the surveillance footage in the bedrooms? I did. Gutterie : Did you ever witness Molly Ryan providing sexual services? I did. Was there one gentleman in particular who began to see her increasingly often in the months before Molly's murder? Yes. And did this gentleman pay a steep premium for Molly to be exclusive to him and only him? He did. Can you please tell us this gentleman's name? Prince Theo. (gallery gasps, murmurs) Objection! Inflammatory. Sustained. Silence in court! Gutterie : Your Honor, the jury needs to know that someone other than Grace Atwood is responsible for this crime! I'm warning you, Mr. Gutterie. Molly Ryan told you the prince of Wales got her pregnant, did she not? Judge : I swear to you, one more utterance, Gutterie, I will hold you in contempt! She told you that Prince Theo knocked her up and threatened her if she kept the baby, did she not? Strike that from the record! Yes! Yes! Judge : That's it! (gavel bangs) Officer, arrest Mr. Gutterie on charges of contempt of court. Jury, disregard those statements. (handcuffs clicking) I have no further questions, Your Honor. Reporter (over TV) : Still no comment from the Royal Family after Prince Theo was named in connection with the Molly Ryan murder. Although the prince has canceled all of his upcoming public appearances. Legal experts are torn over just how much impact this will have on the case, if any. The U. K. and the rest of the globe are reeling in shock. In England, some have clamored for His Highness to make a statement and deny the allegation. Aide : Excuse me, Your Highness? Miss Crockleby is on the line. Not now. Um, Her Majesty also rang. She says... Not... now. Reporter : ...the very name of the Monarchy is at stake. ♪ ♪ 
♪ Ain't got no money for you, pretty thing... ♪ Word's out, Patty. Their noble prince is finally rolling in the muck. It'll roll right off him. Especially when their witness is a s*x club worker with a rap sheet. I wish Roz kept her mouth shut. The royal b*st*rd canceled his appearance at the hospital today. Of course he did. He's a bloody coward. I was right there, Declan. I had my shot. Now... now he's gonna... hide himself in that palace. I need a way to get to him. Men do strange things in stressful times. Maybe the way to get to him... maybe you're laying right next to her. Kaley? No. Told you, I tried. She wants no part of it. Who says she needs to know? Heard your barrister put on quite the performance. Yeah, let's just say my case must be in pretty bad shape for him to pull something that desperate. (whispers): Hey, come on. You got to stay positive. It's the only way you're gonna get through it. If this jury's got any brains, they'll come to their senses and they'll acquit you. Grace : I saw the way they looked at me. My stepdad set up a trust fund for me. A big one. If they find me guilty, what the heck am I gonna spend it all on? You could spend it. You want to live in the country? You want horses? You can. With me. I'd keep quiet if I were you. Don't want to get in any more trouble than you already are. (door buzzes) (siren wailing in distance) Natalie :  Oh, my God. Stan did it. He played the Prince Theo card. Good for him. What happened? Gwen scorched Roz on cross-examination. Stan got arrested for contempt. But the upshot is the jury heard the prince's name before going off to deliberate. Big question is: did they believe it? I'm not counting on it. If we're gonna find something out here, we better find it fast, before they have a chance to deliver a verdict. I just hope we're not chasing ghosts, that's all. Jessica Marshall's earring didn't get here on its own, mate. (dog barking) Natalie : Oh, my God. Bruno : This is it, Natalie. Looks like the killer's done us a favor. Gift-wrapped her to preserve her DNA. Bruno : Missing one earring. This has got to be her. Pike : That's Jessica Marshall, all right. ♪ ♪
