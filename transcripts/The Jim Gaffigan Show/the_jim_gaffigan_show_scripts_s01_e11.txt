 Are you doing all right, or what? 
 Yeah, yeah. 
 Yeah? 
 'Cause your eyes look exceptionally beady today. 
 Ah, I haven't slept in, like, a week. 
 The kids are on round two of the stomach flu. 
 Ugh. This is probably how the Black Plague started. 
 Thanks, man. The city should just burn your apartment to the ground. 
 I think my kids already had Black Plague last month. 
 I don't think you can get it twice. 
 Nah. Hey, listen, man. 
 This, ah, may not be the best time to tell you, but, ah, I got invited to the Melbourne Comedy Fest. 
 Oh, that's great. 
 Yeah, man. 
 You're not jealous? 
 No, no, no. 
 I was invited too, but I'm probably gonna have to turn it down. 
 Turn it down? 
 You're gonna turn down a free trip to Australia? 
 Well, Dave, the festival's a month long. 
 I can't leave Jeannie with five kids for a month. 
 Oh, yeah. 'Cause she'll cheat on you. 
 What? No. 
 Well, then, bring the prison warden and the basketball team, man. 
 I mean, this is... this is the kind of thing that could change your career, you know? 
 Do you know how much it costs to fly six people to Australia? 
 No, I do not, and thanks to a thing called common sense, I never will. 
 All : Hey! 
 It's John Mulaney. 
 What's up, man? How you doing? 
 How are you, man? 
 Good to see you. I got to tell you, I saw your show. I loved it. 
 I heard you're gonna do another one. Is that right? 
 I think I want to, yeah. 
 And I got an offer from TV Land. 
 I'm sorry? 
 TV Land. 
 Oh, okay. 
 Yeah, yeah, yeah. 
 I thought it was, like, an amusement park or something, but it's a cable channel. 
 And it's nice, but the money's bad. 
 Probably not a good idea. 
 I think comic doing a show on TV Land... a little pathetic. 
 Yeah, it's kind of sad. 
 It'd be embarrassing. 
 I'd be a little bit... 
 It'd be nice to have the work, Yeah. but it'd be embarrassing. 
 Yeah, yeah. 
 Hey, are you two gonna come to Australia? 
 Well, I am. This one's passing, man. 
 Yeah. I-I can't. 
 You know, five kids. 
 For real five kids? 
 Oh, I thought that was a joke. 
 That's real. 
 Yeah, no. I have five kids. 
 Yeah. 
 All right. So, you'll be Melbourne? 
 I will, man. I will, I will. 
 Call me when you get there. 
 It's such a fun, stupid place. Yeah, Is it? Is it? you just... it's like endless nights. 
 Oh my, God. 
 It's great. And then afterwards, Okay... me a few comics are going on this little boondoggle to Asia if you want to come. 
 Oh, are you Just a few days. kidding. No, I'm there. 
 You know, I got to tell you, I love Asian women, and Asian women, they love me, as it turns out. Isn't that nice? 
 That's nice. 
 Wow, you pulled off racism, sexism, and narcissism in one sentence. 
 Yeah, I did. I did do that. 
 That's pretty impressive. 
 You know, anyway, why does this guy need to go to Asia, right? 
 When his apartment is already so similar to a crowded Tokyo subway? 
 Okay. 
 Let's get something to eat. You want to come with us? 
 We're going... 
 To Katz's. 
 No, I've only just woken up. 
 Oh. 
 I'm not gonna eat for hours. 
 I like your style, buddy. 
 I'll see you in Melbourne. 
 All right, brother. 
 Love you, Dave. 
 All right, man. 
 Think about it, Jim. Australian! 
 See you. 
 Have you... have you gained weight? 
 No, lost... seven pounds. Take care. 
 (beatboxing) 
 Mulaney, huh? 
 Yeah. 
 Man, he is on fire. 
 Yep. 
 Dave : His career's kind of kicking your career's ass a little bit, no? 
 Jim : Well, I didn't know our careers were fighting. 
 You know what your problem is? 
 I don't care what you think? 
 You got too many kids. 
 Got too many kids. 
 First you don't do that movie in Alaska 'cause you're afraid of being away from the germ factory for more than five minutes and now this thing. 
 You know, I would've been in Alaska for three months and the role I was offered had five lines. 
 Priorities, Jim. 
 Hey. 
 Jim, where were you last week? Sales went down. 
 Yeah, the whole family had the stomach flu. 
 (Shudders) God, even hearing about your life makes me feel sick. 
 Don't make me lose my appetite before you buy me lunch, huh? 
 Have you ever thrown up while you had diarrhea? 
 Like, you're on the can and you're like, "Ugh." 
 You're still buying me lunch, I'm just not eating it now. 
 Okay. 
 Can't believe you're not going down there, man. 
 You're getting soft. 
 Getting soft? 
 At this point I'm, like, half pillow. But you know what? 
 My career is going great. 
 Okay. 
 I've been working on a new hour special. 
 It's coming along. You know, it's gonna open opportunities. I can feel it. 
 Yeah? 
 What if Mulaney's special kicks its ass, though? 
 You know what I'm saying? 
 What is your obsession with Mulaney? 
 It's not an obsession. 
 I mean, you know, it's... you know, does Mulaney get more sleep than me? 
 Yeah. 
 Probably, yeah. 
 Does Mulaney have more hair than me? 
 Both : Yeah. 
 Does Mulaney make more money than me? 
 Both : Yes. 
 Does Mulaney... 
 I should probably go to Australia. 
 Yeah. 
 Don't eat the samples. 
 Mulaney doesn't eat the samples. 
 Daniel : Oh, Jim. Hey. 
 Hey. 
 Ooh. You're even more disheveled than normal. 
 You look like a smushed up loaf of Wonder Bread at the bottom of a shopping cart. 
 Well. You look like an evil weatherman. 
 What do you want? 
 Give this to Jeannie. 
 I'm not going up there. I can't afford to get sick right now. 
 Like anyone can afford to get sick. 
 Finally, I'm rich enough to get the stomach flu. 
 What is this? 
 It's organic tea tree oil. 
 Oh, thank God. Don't you hate the non-organic tea tree oil? 
 You know organic is just a grocery store term for overpriced? 
 Jim, I don't have time for your Joe Six-pack wisdom right now. 
 I'm on my way to get a massage. 
 Tell Jeannie I got that at the Williamsburg Farmer's Market that we used to go to every Saturday in college. 
 I won't tell her any of those things, but I promise to throw this out when I get up there. 
 Okay. 
 (vacuum whirring) 
 What the hell happened in here? 
 Got an e-mail. They had an outbreak of lice at the kids' school. 
 Again? 
 Wait, weren't our kids just home all week with the stomach flu? 
 Everybody knows those lice can jump, like, six blocks. 
 Jim : No, everyone doesn't know that, Jeannie, 'cause I don't think that's true. 
 So, now all our kids have lice? 
 Well, we haven't actually found any yet, but we should de-lice you. 
 Blanca : You probably brought it back from an airplane. 
 That's crazy. I don't have lice. 
 I have three hairs on my head and I just got my hair cut. I need a nap. 
 I'm not getting de-liced. 
 Dave and these New York comedians are going to the Melbourne Festival this year. 
 They're just gonna leave their life for a month? 
 Yeah. Dave thinks I should go. 
 Oh, yeah? Does Dave have five children? 
 Well... h-he understands it's an investment in the future. 
 If I got into international stand-up markets, I could actually afford to have five kids. 
 What is that supposed to mean? 
 Never mind. 
 I don't know if I should go to the festival or not. 
 Why don't you ask God what you should do? 
 (Jim exhales) 
 You know, I always forget to ask God career advice. 
 Hey, God. Should I go to Australia? 
 No answer, huh? 
 You know what, maybe he's a little busy with the Middle East, Jeannie. 
 Okay. Sit still. 
 Do you see any lice? 
 No, but you might have the invisible ones. 
 All right, this is ridiculous. 
 I'm gonna take a nap. 
 No, you can't! 
 The sheets have to be washed three times in hot water. 
 I'll just sleep on the mattress. 
 No, you can't! The invisible lice are gonna get on the mattress and we're gonna get bedbugs. 
 That makes no sense! 
 I'm... I'm getting out of here. 
 I just got to wash this crap out of my hair. 
 (beatboxing) 
 Blanca : Jim, can you watch Elizabeth while I get the kids dressed, please? 
 Venga, niños. 
 Fine. 
 Venga, niños. 
 Daddy, this my rubber ducky. 
 You can have it. 
 Thanks. 
 Daddy, why don't you have any hair? 
 Your mother pulls it out when I'm sleeping. 
 Something I haven't done for a month. 
 You have soap on your head. 
 (clattering) 
 (groans) 
 (splash) 
 Jeannie! 
 Oh, no. 
 "Oh, no?" You know what's on this laptop? 
 Everything! 
 Oh! 
 My new hour set! 
 12 months of notes, gone. 
 Okay. I'm sorry. 
 You're sorry? 
 This is my job. 
 This is our income. 
 I have one thing... one thing in this overcrowded, horrible apartment that's mine and it's ruined. 
 Everything important in my life is on this laptop. 
 You don't back up everything on a hard drive? 
 Jeannie : Jim, relax. They're just children. 
 No, there is too many children, Jeannie. 
 Oh, nice. Nice, Jim. 
 Why don't you go take a walk? 
 Ja,  to Canada. 
 Come here. You're okay. Come here. 
 (beatboxing) 
 Father Nicholas : Jim. Where are you off to? 
 Since I can't nap in my own apartment, I'm off to drown my sorrows in overpriced guacamole. 
 Oh, you have a wonderful day. 
 Wonderful day? 
 This is the worst day of my life. 
 Well, do you want to come to the church and talk about it? 
 No, no, no, no. I'm not going in there. 
 That's where it all started. 
 What started? 
 The wedding and the baptism and the four other baptisms. 
 What? That's beautiful, Jim... 
 No, it's not beautiful. 
 Because of your kooky religion, my wife is so crazy we already have five kids and it may never stop. 
 I-I-I know it's hard sometimes, Jim, but deep down, you know what you value most in your heart. 
 I will pray for you. 
 How about this for a prayer: I wish I'd never gotten married and had kids. How about that one? 
 Yeah, well, your camping jokes are better. 
 That one needs a lot of work. 
 Mrs. Gagliano!

 P.S., you're out of spray. 
 Lovely. 
 Hey, hot pocket guy. 
 What the hell, Dave? Get that girl out of here. 
 Why should I, man? You're the one who brought her home. 
 What? I've never seen her before, and Jeannie would kill me if she saw her.

 You better go find some help, man. Seriously.

 You! Steve Buscemi! 
 I'm not Steve Buscemi. 
 How hard did I hit my head? 
 You didn't hit your head. 
 You never got run over by those bikes because you never married Jeannie. 
 Okay. You're not Steve Buscemi. 
 You're a crazy guy. 
 I'm not crazy. 
 You know, I-I-I'll take it from here, whoever you are. Thank you. 
 Father Nicholas. 
 You got to help me, please. 
 Yes, yes. Of course. How can I help? 
 I know I was out of line, but you have to understand, the kids have been sick. 
 I haven't slept in a week, and I-I was run over by a pack of hipsters on bikes. 
 You okay? 
 Yeah, yeah, I mean, Steve here... or whatever his name is... helped me get to my apartment, and then I guess I was a jerk to Jeannie, 'cause she's made it look like Dave is my roommate. 
 Dave is your roommate. 
 Dave is not my roommate. 
 Anyway, Jeannie and the kids are gone and now there's some weird drunk lady in her underwear in my apartment.
