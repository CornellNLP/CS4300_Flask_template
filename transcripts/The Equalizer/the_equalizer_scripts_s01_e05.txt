 What kind of charity needs a consult   after  :   at night? 
 The international kind. 
 The CIA wants you back, Robyn. 
 You're the best they had. 
 ♪ Work it out ♪    
 ROBYN: This is Melody, one of my oldest friends. 
 - Enjoying being dead? 
 - MEL: You got him    out of one life sentence and straight into another. 
 HARRY: Why do I have a feeling this is not a social call? 
 I need those freaky-ass superpowers of yours. 
 - My pleasure. 
 - MAN: We'd be happy to Accommodate your new hobby if you came back to the fold. 
 I'm ready to deal. 
 Freelance only. 
 Rest of the time, they can just stay out of my way. 
 Look what I found. 
 Give it back! 
 Why? 
 You can't play. 
 ROBYN: But I can. 
 One shot. 
 If I make it, you make the girl a regular in your games. 
 And if you miss? 
 Well, then I guess I'm buying the girl a new ball. 
 Yes! 
 (LAUGHING) 
 Hey. 
 You want to play with us? 
 No. 
 But she does. 
 HORSE? 
 Mm-hmm. 
 BISHOP: You do bar mitzvahs, too? 
 (CHUCKLES) 
 (SCOFFS) 
 Why'd you want to meet me? 
 Company needs a favor. 
 A British doctoral candidate on a federal grant overstayed his visa; He's in the wind. 
 Call ICE. 
 Dorian Endicott. 
 College mathematician. 
 Loudmouth. 
 Drinks too much. 
 Could be on a bender. 
 Call his sponsor. 
 His family's connected. 
 They don't want him to embarrass them, so they reached out to MI who reached out to the CIA who then reached out to me. 
 Look, I'm sorry, Bish. 
 I got a spa weekend with my aunt planned. 
 So, wait, whoa, whoa. 
 So grab him. 
 Drop him off at the British, uh, Consulate, and then go get your broccoli emulsion. 
 - You know that's not a thing. 
 - Look, hey. 
 Company asked for you, Robyn, by name. 
 Do this, they'll give you some rhythm, at least for a while. 
 Don't you think I'm a little overqualified for a lost-and-found detail? 
 Well, maybe our friends are just trying to remind you that they're still pulling your strings. 
 It's a milk run. 
 Not worth kicking up dust over. 
 It's the end of the fiscal quarter, and one of the charities I'm consulting for is slammed. 
 They sent up a flare. 
 - I understand. 
 - I'll be there by, like,  :  .

 Robyn. 
 I would feel better if you made me feel worse. 
 I mean, I-I had a month to plan. 
 And you're presenting later. 
 It's a creative visualization seminar, not a gender reveal, and you're my guest, so the room's comped anyway. 
 Just get there when you get there. 
 - Tonight. 
 I promise.

 Is that all you're packing? 
 What? 
 I just need my homework. 
 I've got enough clothes at Dad's. 
 Well, don't forget about your community service hours this weekend. 
 Okay. 
 I only skipped once, all right? 
 Yeah, and lied about it. 
 Yes, but I was still planning on doing it when I told you I did it. 
 But if you want to be technical... 
 No, I want to be honest. 
 And every time you lie to me makes me wonder what else you're lying to me about. 
 So... 
 don't. 
 'Cause I'll find out. 
 Get a massage, Mom. 
 Please. 
 I swear I am. 
  - Bye. 
 - Bye. 
  HARRY: So that doctoral candidate you're looking for... 
  I don't think he's just on a bender. 
  He, uh, deleted all his social media recently. 
  He hasn't been on his cell phone in three days. 
  And he hasn't accessed his email. 
  So he just ghosted? 
  (SIGHS) 
 Yeah, full-on Casper. 
  It's like the guy suddenly dropped off the face of the earth. 
  And then he... 
  started erasing himself. 
  Well, I think I know where his grant money went. 
  Expensive Scotch. 
  Fine cigars. 
  What did you say he was studying? 
  Oh, the ushe: Heuristic algorithms as applied to stochastic systems. 
  English, Harry. 
  It's a way to account for uncertainty. 
  It's used for financial modeling, uh, insurance risk assessments. 
  Random systems. 
  Sexy.

  I happen to be more of a Python man, but you know that. 
  Keep your Python to yourself. 
  Got a letter here from the NSF about his research grant. 
  I wouldn't be too impressed. 
  They tend to toss those things around like confetti. 
  Well, it looks like the party was over for Mr. Endicott, 'cause it's a notice of the grant's expiration. 
  Excuse me. 
  Who are you? 
  Sue Wachtell. 
  NSF grants committee. 
  I'm here to get an update on Mr. 
 Endicott's research. 
  Phillip Moss. 
 Chair of the Math Department. 
  I'll save you some time. 
  The climate change algorithm you've been funding, I doubt he got off square one. 
  Why do you say that?

  Half the time he didn't show. 
  The other half he... 
  Well, here. 
  His students compiled these for HR.

  STUDENT: Is he drunk? 
  I'm tasked     with notifying him of his suspension.

 I'm already late on my rent. 
  - I just, I... 
 - Calm down, ma'am. 
  What's the name of your boss? 
  Endicott. 
  Dorian Endicott. 
  ROBYN: The sender was anonymous. 
  And all that was on the card were these numbers. 
  Who sends an orchid with a bunch of numbers? 
  Maybe it's a nerd's idea of foreplay. 
  - Or a code. 
 - I'm running the three series through a program that matches up the numbers with known cryptographs. 
  It could be a decimal-based cipher. 
  A multiple encryption numeric system.

  You'd have loved it. 
  Too bad you called the Director of National Intelligence a rock-licking moron.

  I like to tell it like it is. 
  Which makes one of us. 
  So, that milk run that you sent McCall on turned into a firefight. 
  As far as we knew, it was a standard retrieval. 
  And now Endicott's in the wind. 
  Thanks to McCall. 
  Is that really how you want to play this, Suri? 
  Who is this guy, anyway? 
  What's going on? 
  You don't know, do you? 
  Look, tell McCall we're sorry how this went down. 
  Okay? 
  And given the evolving situation, it would be best if she brought Endicott directly to us instead of the Brits. 
  Yeah. 
 Okay. 
  So, Nash says sorry you almost got your ticket punched, but, uh... 
  do us another solid. 
  I think that'll play well. 
  We'll make it worth her while. 
  Wait. 
  So, I bring in Endicott, and my account is squared permanently with the CIA? 
  No more looking over my shoulder? 
  Straight from the director's mouth. 
  Director Nash is not the type to sweeten the pot. 
  I think the stakes have changed, and I think something big's going down, but they're not sharing. 
  I'm in. 
  Be worth it to have them out of my life. 
  But I've been burned by Nash before so... 
  I'll deliver Endicott after I know I'm not being played. 
  I still have contacts in British intelligence, so I'm gonna ask some questions, okay?

  No, they were shooting at me. 
 They wanted him alive. 
  Harry, you got to track where Endicott went.

  Word is that said mathematician might have discovered something that's a matter of urgent British national security.

  Now, we couldn't get into his laptop, so I had to go old-school. 
  I learned to copy his keystrokes.

  Well, what does the relationship with your family have to do with people chasing you? 
  Nothing.

  A cryptocurrency. 
  Well, he's not as dim as he looks. 
  ROBYN: So this whole thing is about cryptocurrency? 
  No. 
 See, the trick to crypto is making sure the encryption can never be broken. 
  My day job is basically machine learning applied to random systems, like climate. 
  So you modified the software to test the encryption. 
  Yes. 
 And it decoded it instantly. 
  I assumed the currency was a flop until I ran the software test against Bitcoin. 
  It decrypted it instantly, too. 
  No. 
 That's impossible. 
  No, it's reality. 
  I wanted to create a new currency. 
  Instead, I made the most powerful decryption tool known to man. 
  A master key that can access any information on any network anywhere in the world. 
  I call it the God Algorithm.
