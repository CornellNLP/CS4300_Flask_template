 You are being watched. 
 The government has a secret system... 
 A machine that spies on you every hour of every day. 
 I know, because I built it. 
 I designed the machine to detect acts of terror, but it sees everything... 
 Violent crimes involving ordinary people, people like you, crimes the government considered irrelevant. 
 They wouldn't act, so I decided I would. 
 But I needed a partner, someone with the skills to intervene. 
 Hunted by the authorities, we work in secret. 
 You will never find us. 
 But victim or perpetrator, if your number's up, we'll find you. We have a new number, Mr. Reese. His name is Michael Cahill. That all you got, Finch? Cahill's 33 years old, single, no wife, no children, no pets. No attachments of any kind. A bit like you, Mr. Reese. Problem with this guy's passport at Kennedy. I.N.S. is on the way. We're supposed to wait. "This guy" just flew 15 hours for a heart transplant. I'm not letting him code out here 16 blocks from the hospital. For all intents and purposes, Cahill appears to be an upstanding citizen. Reese:  Appearances can be deceptive. We're paying you good money, so keep your mouth shut, okay? Finch:  Indeed. Cahill's a criminal. B&E, assaulting an officer with a deadly weapon. Now he's graduated to smuggling. Crew's run by a guy named Vargas. These guys will move anything. And if someone gets in their way, they'll kill everyone. How do you suggest we proceed, Mr. Reese? As usual ,Finch. More they are dangerous... What are you waiting for ? On the way ! The closer I want to be to them. [Police siren wails] We got a problem. Let me talk to the cop. I got this. Stay put. [Car door clacks shut] Relax, kid. Cahill will talk us out of this. And if he can't, he'll just kill him. I never met a guy who hated cops as much as this guy. Yeah, so what's taking him so long, huh? He calls backup and we're all dead. He doesn't have backup. I'm all paid up with HR. You found this rig? Tail light's out. Our friend was just letting us know as a courtesy. Here's your cut. [Car engine turns over] [Door clacks shut] Thought I was gonna have to waste them. [Grunting] Mike, Mike. Hold up, brother. Kid's done enough learning for tonight, Mike. One more mistake, I kill him. [Groans] Got a problem, Finch. Cahill's on the move. It's nearly 3:00 in the morning. Any idea where he's going? No. But whatever he's up to, can't be good. Finch, Cahill's casing a home. 3404 Orchard Avenue in Brooklyn. He's breaking in, Finch. I need some information. Now. Homeowner's last name is Tulley. He's a police officer. John, you've got to stop Cahill. Daddy! Daddy! You're home. Hey, boy. [Gun clicks] Time for all good boys to go to sleep. Later, champ. Sleep tight. [Laughs] Mr. Reese, it appears  that you're not the only person working undercover. {pub}[Numbers spoken in German over radio] [Radio shuts off] They might be updating our orders. You think this is being run through Langley? We're not even supposed to operate in this godforsaken country. How many times are you gonna clean that thing? In the army, they taught us the fastest way to get shot was to fail to clean your weapon. In the marines, they taught us the fastest way to clean your weapon was to shoot a couple people with it. [Knock on door] [Gun clicks] Best I could do. Cheap Polish vodka. Package secure? We have everything we need... Except the orders of where to deliver it. Almost everything. You're missing a glass. Found it. The package. What'd he do? Not our concern. Guy looks government. The natives don't like us taking their people. He's government. Tried to sell something of ours to the Chinese. What? Software. Something. I don't know, don't care. We've got one job in this... Render him to some black hole from which he will never return. If the papers don't clear or the plane runs out of fuel, you execute him. When was the last time you were in country, my friend? Call's not coming in tonight. Go get yourself some R&R. Don't forget you're behind enemy lines. You get caught here, you're on your own. Cahill certainly had me fooled. Cahill's real name is Daniel Tulley. Graduated from the police academy in 2003. Since then, all work records have disappeared. The NYPD seems to have gone to great lengths to hide his identity, including a false social security number. But if the machine gave us his number, it may mean that somebody's figured out he's a cop. We should warn him. Risking his life is what he signed up for. We play this wrong... We could do more harm than good. [Car lock beeps] We've got company, Finch. Why don't you just wear it if you're gonna go announcing yourself? Less than a day away from the biggest collar of your career, you decide to take a holiday? The man's Cahill's handler. No one followed me. I just... Needed to feel normal. We got enough on Vargas. I could pull you out now. We could have gotten Vargas five months ago. He's just a smuggler. L.O.S., that's the guy we want. Word is he's picking up the next shipment in person. L.O.S. is a fairy tale, Michael. I took this from the last delivery from L.O.S. It's 100% pure. We found the big one. The direct source. Whoever this L.O.S. is... If no one's stepping on his shipments, there's a good reason. I don't want to wind up in a dark suit, having to inform your wife... I'll take care of my end, you take care of yours. I think Vargas has a cop in his pocket. Last night he was too confident that black and white wouldn't have backup. He's got someone protecting him from the inside, I'm sure of it. I'll look into it. Cahill believes Vargas has a cop on his payroll. So do I. Vargas was talking about being paid up with HR... The same corrupt cops who were willing to let Elias kill Carter. Detective Carter! Agent Snow. Didn't realize you were still in town. I took a trip upstate. I'm sure now that our boy's working with a police officer. What makes you say that? Found his fingerprints at a veterinary clinic in the Catskills. And yet I am certain that John was never there. I hope his new friend is luckier. John has a tendency to use people and then, well, discard them. I remember his old partner's funeral like it was yesterday. A pretty woman. Like you. After he was done with her, not so much. A word, Detective. You do realize the man that shot John was just here? Agent Snow doesn't know about me... Or my arrangement with our mutual friend. We need your help, Detective. This man is Michael Cahill, otherwise known as Daniel Tulley... Narcotics Detective working undercover with a smuggling ring. One that Mr. Reese has just infiltrated. [Scoffs] Of course he has. But we believe that there's a leak at the NYPD. I don't need to tell you what can happen if Cahill's cover is blown. And you expect me to find this leak. I just need you to explain the system. Who would know about Cahill's being undercover? Only his handler. What about the people that have access to his paperwork, files? Files on undercovers are kept only as hard copies, so people like you can't hack into them. Words wound, Detective. The files are kept in safes in one room controlled by IAB. However, only the handlers have the combinations to their UC's safe. Anyone tries to break in, IAB will send them on a one-way trip to Rikers. We would need to destroy Cahill's file before anyone could retrieve it. We? Yeah, see, breaking into 1PP is a federal offense. I've got it covered. [Cell phone rings] Let me guess, you need another favor. Someone might be selling out an undercover narc to a smuggler named Vargas. Pay some of your dirty buddies in narcotics a visit. Those guys don't exactly trust me anymore. I've been getting some good collars lately too. Even got a commendation. Your ass got you that commendation. Time to get your hands dirty again. [Cell phone rings] Yeah? You don't say. Which one? Well, find out then. Now. Something's wrong, Finch. Vargas got a phone call, and he's not happy about it. We go ahead with the delivery now. [Camera clicks] [Computer keys clicking] Because L.O.S. will kill us if we don't. How many time I invite you for dinner? All business with you. Business is good. No time to eat. You know, I've been thinking. You and I might want to renegotiate our deal. You know, in our business, thinking... Is the most dangerous thing you can start doing. Or maybe I take the shipment directly to L.O.S.? Cut you out. [Guns clicking] Fine, fine. Tell you what. How about I give you a little something extra, okay? Just for you? Yeah? [Gunshot] [Gunfire] [Screams] [Groans] Come on, come on! Out! Let's go! Move it! Get him in the back. That's it. Hit it. [Tires screeching] [Tires screech] Fools, hurry up. Yeah. All right. Come on. Lay down there. [Grunts] Thought we were meeting with L.O.S., boss. We are. Just making a little pit stop first. Take your phones out and destroy them. Drop looks to be in Brooklyn. Should have the exact location in a second. [Computer beeps] [Phones clattering] [Computer beeps] What happened? Your weapons... Toss 'em in. All of you. Now. One of you is a cop. In an hour or two, I'm going to find out which one. Whoever's still alive will finish making this delivery. {pub} That America is a place where all things are possible... Who still wonders if the dream of our founders is alive in our time. Do you mind? No, not at all. [Over TV] The power of our democracy. Hell of a thing, huh? Tonight is your answer. [Cheers and applause] You, uh, live in New York, or you just visiting? Just visiting. Where you from? Originally? Puyallup, Washington. Are you kidding me? My wife's from Puyallup. You still live there? Not for a long time. I travel for work. Ah. I used to do that. It's brutal. Not anymore. Me and the wife just put a down payment on our first house... Up in New Rochelle. You don't say. Sounds nice. Hey, you know what? My wife's running late, as usual. I better give her a call. Make sure she's okay. What did I tell you, John? You told me to get a drink. And of the 8 million people you could be drinking with in New York City, you just happened to pick the one who's married to your ex? [Groans] Gotta help me. Please, please. He's losing too much blood. We should take him to the hospital. No one's going anywhere until I know which one of you is a rat. [Gulps, sobs] Sip it. Slowly, slowly. [Swallows, panting] Take me to the hospital, Mike, please! Shut it or I'll put you out of your misery myself. Help me, please. We need to build a tourniquet. Why bother? If we stop the bleeding, it might get him to shut up. You guys get a call? Someone lit up Su Chin's. Narco thing gone South. Damn shame. Best Kung Pao in Queens. Sorry for your loss. [Cell phone rings] Where's your partner? Oh, let me guess. Queens? I'm having a little trouble finding him, actually. You lost him? "Lost" would be a strong word. But, yes, Detective, in answer to your unspoken question, I do need your help. What you got? A license plate. 
 
 He's lost a lot of blood. Think he'll make it? Probably not. We did the best we could. [Cell phone chimes] All right, we got a break. We're looking for a warehouse on the Docks in Brooklyn. Dispatch, we need multiple units to respond. Hey! Look what the cat drug in. You look terrible. Look at you. You might want to lay off the brown liquor. To what do I owe the pleasure? Smuggler by the name of Neil Vargas. You ever heard of him? Want to twist his arm a little bit, see if I can get a percentage of his scores. Thought maybe you might want to get in. I don't hear a peep from you for three months, then all of a sudden you show up with this new score. Hard to trust a guy whose buddies wind up in prison. You want to shake down this Vargas? You gotta be a good boy and ask permission. If this guy isn't already paid up with HR, you could have at it. Who do I contact if I want to contact HR? You already have. [Cell phone rings] I'll be in touch. I won't hold my breath. Yeah? Finch:  There's gonna be a shift change at 1 Police Plaza. This may be our only opportunity. Opportunity for what? Are you in position, Detective? Whoa, whoa, easy with the volume there. No wonder Mr. Sunshine's always in a foul mood. You'll get used to it. It takes a little time, which you're running out of. Okay, okay. What's the plan, Kimosabe? The plan is simple. The IAB Detective that patrols the room makes one more inspection before the next shift begins. That will give you approximately 8 1/2 minutes to spoof the key card, break into the safe,  and retrieve Tulley's file before Vargas's informant can get to it. Yeah, sure. Sounds simple. Make sure you point the reader at the key card. Anything else I should know? Yeah, don't get caught. Thanks a lot. I'll try my best. Fusco, what are you doing here? What are you doing? Uh, I was just leaving. I'm just, uh, running an errand for the Captain. Later. Yeah, you have a good day. All right. [Cell phone dials] Detective Carter. Got three possible hits on that license plate. It was logged by an automatic plate reader on a Cruiser in South Brooklyn. I'm gonna start looking. I'm glad to hear it. Thank you, Detective. Fusco:  Finch, Finch? You there? I'm here. Go ahead. All right. I'm going in now. I'm... I'm sorry. That's fine. [Beep] Presto. I'm in. Okay, what now? Turn off the fluorescents. Use that light I gave you. Do you see the prints? 3-5-8. Start punching numbers. The code could be in any sequence. [Keypad beeps] We're running out of time, Detective. I tried every combination. It's not working. A little help, please? Was one of the prints smudged? Yeah, 5 is a little blurry, why? It's used twice. Try 3-5-5-8. 5-5-8-3. 8-5-3-5. Can't believe it worked. I've got Tulley's file. Good job, Detective . Tulley's safe for now. You have 23 seconds left. Detective Fusco, right? My department investigated you and your buddies. Listen, this isn't what it looks like. I can explain. Explain shredding a confidential file? You're under arrest. I had to destroy that file. [Car door clacks shut] There was a UC whose life was in danger. And you know this how? I've got a guy... tells me things. What guy? What things? Finch:  Careful what you say, Detective. We can look after you, but these men Look, it doesn't make a difference who the guy is. All you need to know is that a cop's life was on the line and I was trying to save him. [Cell phone rings] Yeah. I got a problem. I couldn't get the file. Some idiot destroyed it. But whoever the rat is, I got word he just made  a phone call from your location. What do you mean, somebody made a call? That's impossible. I've got to take care of a situation. I'll call you back later. You're the informant. Where's his phone? Whole let easier for me to search you after I shoot you. He took it. You kidding? Huh? The hell I did. Get off me! Shouldn't be too hard to find out. [Cell phone dials] [Cell phone rings] Looks like we found our rat. {pub}You tell the cops about L.O.S.? Huh? The delivery? You shouldn't waste time. My reinforcements will be here any minute. [Grunts] If that were true, I would have gotten a call from my guy and you'd be dead. We're not getting anywhere. Give me time alone. I'll get him to talk. You better get him to talk or you both catch a bullet. [Groans] Who the hell are you? I know you're not a cop. No. But I've been undercover. I know the only thing you want in the world is to go home to your wife Melinda, to your son Danny. Hey. Let's get one thing straight. You don't know me. I know your handler's name is Byrne. I know you've been on the force since 2003. I know you had a younger brother Connor who O.D.'d a month after you graduated high school. How did you... That's why you're so committed to catching L.O.S. What, are you a fed or something? Something. I can help you escape. Help you get home. If you know me so well, then you know I won't go home. Not while L.O.S. Is still operating. Your cover's gonna be blown. You stay, you risk everything. Your life... Your family. Can you get a message to my wife? Tell her I love her. We'll find a way to get you home. And you can tell her yourself. The exchange is at the scrapyard. He's coming. [Groans] That's right. He say anything yet? I need more time. Okay, there's no more time. [Gun clicks] Ajax is dead. We've gotta dump the bodies. No, no. Let me do it. I want to see the look on his face as I end this rat. Help yourself. What's the play here, John? We're gonna kill this guy? Dissolve his body in a bathtub full of acid? Or are you just scratching an itch? His name is Peter. He's 37, makes 175,000 a year. Is he a good guy or a serial killer? I don't know. But either way, he'll take better care of her than you could. This is why I worried about bringing you back. See, you look like the rest of these people... But you're not like them anymore, are you? If they knew what you'd done... You're barely even the same species. We're walking in the dark. I've heard this speech before. Hey, uh... Sorry, I didn't realize you were meeting someone as well. Honey, you didn't tell him about your much-better half? There will be hell to pay later. We should get going. Wait. Two seconds. Um, I really want you to meet my wife. She's going to get a kick out of meeting someone from Puyallup. I get it. Believe me. First time I rotated back, I went straight home to my family. I sat outside in the rental car for three hours, just watching. And I realized I could tell them everything that I'd seen, everything that I'd done, and they wouldn't understand a single word. This isn't some speech. We're not... walking in the dark. We are the dark. Oh, Peter. Jessica. I'm sorry. I'm sorry I'm late. It's time to go, John. There's a couple at the bar I want you to meet. Okay. Huh. I guess it's just us? Yeah. Yeah. What's the holdup? He'll be harder to I.D. without this. Car will burn hot enough. Won't be anything left to I.D. {pub}Need a lift? I was in the neighborhood. My lucky day. Your version of a lucky day is being shot and lit on fire? Not shot, just grazed. Lucky for me, Cahill's an excellent marksman. [Cell phone rings] It's for you. Where's Cahill? Oh, I'm... Fine, Finch. Thanks for asking. Cahill went to the exchange with L.O.S. Without backup. Where? South Brooklyn scrapyard. Headed there now. You got any firearms besides that piece? Yeah. Girl after my own heart. -  Mr. Reese. Yeah. We have one other problem. Vargas's informant has Detective Fusco. And his life is most certainly in danger. Mr. Reese,  I'm not sure we have time to save them both. All right, thanks. This is L.O.S.? You made a mess out of this. Next time, don't keep me waiting. Back! Back! You stay back, or I spill your boss's brains on the asphalt. Do you know who you're threatening? Where's your backup, son? [Gun clicks] Let him go. You're going to have to shoot. [Gunshots] I wouldn't do that. Stay down. Don't nobody move. On the ground. You gonna arrest me? I'll be out in 14 hours. Then I'm coming for you. Threatening a police officer. I'll add that to the charges. There won't be any charges. At least none that stick. He's CIA. What? The CIA's trafficking drugs? The government couldn't win the war on drugs... So they're using it to fund the war on terror. This is common knowledge? Doubtful. The company's built on secrets. I risked my life for this. I'm taking him in. You do and the company will ruin your career. And that's if you're lucky. I'm taking him in. Always liked to push my luck too. Do you know why I'm so good at my job, Fusco? I can tell a dirty cop when I see one. You should try looking in the mirror. You know, you may think you've gone clean, found God, Buddha, or some African shaman, but at the end of the day, your hands are still dirty. Always will be. You hear that? I don't hear nothing. That's right. No sirens, no bullhorns. No one's coming to save you. No one cares. That guy... The one who tells you things... He used you, then let you rot like a piece of garbage. Might as well tell me who it is. At least you'll have the satisfaction of repaying the favor. You think you're the first person to put a gun to my head? No. But I will be the last. Yeah, maybe you will. You ever been shot? Craziest things go through your mind... Glad I put on clean underwear, hid that stash of p0rn. Sorry that your son had to find out that his old man was a dirty cop. Then you realize you're gonna die. You try to go down doing something good. You wouldn't know about that, would you, you dirty sack? Kneel. [Gunshot] Cutting it kind of close, don't you think? At least I'm not late. [Grunts] I gotta call this in. I can make this a good shooting. That phone is the only proof that this guy was working with Vargas? Yeah. Let me see it. What the hell are you doing? I can't have you coming clean, Lionel. I need you inside HR. Get close to them. There are cameras inside of 1PP. People will know that I've left with this guy. We're talking murder one. Don't you get it? That's the point. You'll need your friends at HR to help you cover this up. I was just starting to enjoy being a good guy for a change. You've done some nice work, Lionel. I'm sorry, but you're more useful inside. My hands are dirty, always will be, huh? Are we taking mommy to the hospital? Yeah, champ. You're about to have a new little brother. I'm sure I forgot something. I should have packed a week ago. [Laughs] Honey, what is it? You okay? I love you... So much. I know. I thought you might like to know that Agent Snow has arranged the release of L.O.S. He'll be out in less than an hour. What do you plan to do? I'll keep an eye on Cahill and make sure he stays safe and sound. He's about to have a screaming infant. I doubt he'll be anywhere close to sound. Poor guy. It's been a long time, Mark. Surprised they sent you down here for me. You know the agency. They always take care of their own. The whole deal went pear-shaped. Probably cost us 20 million, 30 million. First thing to take care of are those two cops who brought me in... Some undercover and a female detective. I gave them both fair warning. They gotta go. We gotta send a message. You're always impulsive, Ray. You can't go around killing cops. And you really shouldn't have gotten yourself arrested. I warned you. You're behind enemy lines here. Come on. [Grunting] Got your call. Looks like you got yourself in a little trouble. It was an accident. Most accidents don't require a shovel. Help me make this go away. I'll be indebted. You'll be a little bit more than indebted, my friend. You belong to HR now. Stay tuned for scenes from our next episode.
