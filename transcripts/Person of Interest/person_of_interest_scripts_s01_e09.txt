 You are being watched... 
 The government has a secret system, a machine that spies on you every hour of every day. 
 I know because... 
 I built it. 
 I designed the machine to detect acts of terror, but it sees everything... 
 Violent crimes involving ordinary people, people like you, crimes the government considered irrelevant. 
 They wouldn't act, so I decided I would. 
 But I needed a partner-- 
 Someone with the skills to intervene. 
 Hunted by the authorities, we work in secret. 
 You will never find us. 
 But victim or perpetrator, if your number's up, we'll find you. 
 He's all yours. 
 I already told the other Americans... 
 I deliver fruits and vegetables. 
 You deliver explosives for Al-Qaeda. 
 Your cell is responsible for a suicide bomb that killed three U.S. soldiers in Fallujah. 
 You should tell me the location of the remainder of those explosives. 
 Talk to me, or else you're gonna have to talk to my boss. 
 And believe me when I tell you, you don't want to talk to my boss. 
 All right. 
 Hello, Yusuf. 
 Getting too close-- 
 Enough already. 
 She goes...Today. 
 But it's got to be clean. 
 You can't keep coming in here like this. 
 I gotta go. Detective Carter? 
 It's Mrs. Kovach here to bail out her husband. 
 Again? 
 Figured maybe you could talk to her. 
 I'm the one who ha to investigate it when your husband finally beats you to death. 
 Look, every time you tell us it was an accident, you're strengthening the story he's gonna use to get out of it-- 
 That you were clumsy, accident-prone. 
 Do you hear me? 
 The stairs. 
 I fell down the stairs. 
 If he puts his hands on you again, call me. 
 Sorry. I have to go. 
 I don't know why you bother, Carter. 
 You can't save 'em all. 
 That's a homicide waiting to happen. 
 Figured I'd try to stop one for a change. 
 DNA came back on the shooter you winged a couple weeks ago. 
 The guy who took a shot at you. 
 Half the DNA matched Marlene Elias... 
 The other half... Don Moretti. 
 Carl Elias-- The b*st*rd son you left to rot in the system after you murdered his mother almost 40 years ago. 
 Your mistress. 
 I told you before, sweetheart. 
 I ain't the father of nobody by that name. 
 DNA says otherwise, Don. 
 You're a perfect match. 
 And guess what. 
 Your son's all grown up now. 
 Just a few of his recent victims. 
 Retired Detective Bernie Sullivan, your old capo Vincent Deluca. 
 What is this? What do I care? 
 I'm gonna die an old man in here. 
 Maybe sooner than you think. 
 You killed his mother, and you left him to the wolves. 
 What do you think he's gonna do to you? 
 I wouldn't expect any father's day cards. 
 If you help me, I can offer you protective custody. 
 Who do you think you're talking to? 
 You don't get it. Elias can get to you anywhere. 
 He can find someone you know, turn them on you. 
 And you know what? 
 It's not a question of if, but when. 
 Telling me this guy already took out a cop, took a shot at you 'cause you got too close, and you came here to warn me, huh? 
 Consider it a courtesy call. 
 There a task force going after this Elias, or is it just you, detective? 
 What is that supposed to mean? 
 Way it looks from my side of the fence, you're all alone. 
 Sounds to me like maybe he's coming after you. 
 [Scoffs] 
 All units respond-- 
 Shooting at 168th and Audubon. 
 I came as soon as I heard the description. 
 Yeah, got a young African-American male gunned down on his way home. 
 I got 9-millimeter casings all over the curb. 
 Looks like it was a drive-by. 
 Any witnesses see the car? 
 In this neighborhood? You're kidding, right? 
 [Sighs] 
 Ronnie Middleton. 
 You knew this kid? 
 He witnessed a shooting six months ago up in the Bronx. 
 ID'd the shooter-- Neighborhood thug Hector Alvarez. 
 This kid was a snitch? 
 Yeah. 
 He got cold feet though. Recanted his testimony. 
 D.A. Dropped the case. 
 Looks like Hector found him. 
 He won't get away with it again. 
 Was Ronnie carrying? 
 Yeah, just a, uh, cell phone, and that soda bottle. 
 Mariquitas Cola? 
 Mexican soda. 
 They don't sell that everywhere. 
 I think I know a place that does. 
 And I know somebody saw something. 
 Yeah, getting them to talk is another matter. 
 I'm sure you'll charm something out of them, Fusco. 
 You know, Carter, we've been working together for a while now. 
 My friends call me "Lionel." 
 You got a first name? 
 Sure. 
 "Detective." 
 My name's Detective Fusco with the NYPD. 
 If anyone has seen or heard anything pertaining to what happened here tonight, you can call me at-- 
 I already have your card, Lionel. 
 What the hell are you doing here? 
 Just checking in. 
 What happened here? 
 Lead poisoning. 
 It's going around the neighborhood. 
 NYPD, mister...? 
 Castillo. I'm-- I'm closed for the night. 
 You see what happened out here tonight, Mr. Castillo? 
 I was busy in the back. 
 I-I-I didn't hear anything till the police showed up. 
 See, I find that hard to believe, Mr. Castillo. 
 After that young man bought this Mariquitas soda from your store... 
 He walked out and got shot like a dog in the street. 
 He bought the soda. He left the store. 
 I heard the shots, but-- but I didn't see anything. 
 Okay, so you heard shots. 
 You didn't look out, see a car take off? 
 Please... 
 Not here. 
 I understand. 
 Why don't you come down to the precinct tomorrow, give a statement? 
 Just what you saw. 
 Okay, I'll come down tomorrow. 
 Mr. Reese? Where have you been? 
 We've got another number. 
 If you're gonna tell me Ronnie Middleton, you're a little late, Finch. 
 Kid's already gone. 
 What? Where are you? 
 At the scene of a homicide, wondering how the machine can see one and miss another. 
 I'm sorry, Mr. Reese. 
 The machine detects acts of premeditation. 
 And I'm afraid we've got a big problem with the one it's seeing right now. 
 Whose number came up? 
 Mutual friend of ours... 
 Detective Carter. 
 Want to tell me where you were last night? 
 I was about to ask you the same thing. 
 Working a new case. 
 There you go. 
 Thank you. 
 And I don't have the curfew. 
 You weren't home when I called, and you didn't answer your cell, Taylor. 
 I was only a half an hour late. 
 Yeah. You're staying with grandma till I'm off this case. 
 Hey, Taylor. 
 Mmm. 
 [Girls giggling] 
 So I saw you got that, uh, homecoming dance coming up Friday. 
 You gonna go? 
 Yeah, it must be tough being a freshman. 
 All the girls going out with the older guys. 
 I already asked somebody. 
 Really? 
 Yeah. 
 Well, I want to meet her. 
 I'm gonna be late for school. 
 Uh-uh. 
 I'm taking you. I have time. 
 Stay. 
 [Cell phone chimes] 
 I thought I charged this thing. 
 After you. 
 Thank you. 
 Raised you well. 
 Did you know she had a son? 
 Didn't know you cared. 
 No dad in the picture for some time. 
 You been looking into the detective, Mr. Reese? 
 It pays to know the person coming after you, Finch. 
 Okay, they're leaving now. You'd better hurry up. 
 Almost got it. 
 Forget it. Get out of there now. 
 Do we have picture? 
 And a GPS tracker. 
 Nice work, Harold. 
 We need eyes and ears on her 24-7, even inside the precinct. 
 [Camera shutter clicks] 
 Finch, Carter's going right into Hector's shop. 
 Primary suspect in the Ronnie Middleton shooting. 
 How's the car business, Hector? 
 You say that like you really care, detective. 
 Care about where you were last night. 
 Go ahead, spin that yarn, dazzle me. 
 Sorry. I'm a domesticated man. 
 I was back with my old lady, watching some show. 
 Ask her. 
 Of course. 
 Always with the loyal alibi. 
 You know, Monica, he's handsome, but you can do better. 
 You got some  huevos  coming down here all alone, lady. 
 So that wasn't your muscle car took a detour into Washington Heights last night? 
 Nah, I hear it's dangerous down there. 
 I know y'all heard what happened to Ronnie Middleton. 
 I heard he ate a bullet that didn't agree with him. 
 Nice shop, nice tools. 
 Doing well for yourself, Hector. 
 You make all this money fixing up old cars? 
 I got a record. I got to work for myself. 
 This is a nice ride. You mind if I check it out? 
 Sure as hell do. 
 You're gonna need a warrant for that. 
 You messed up, taking that kid out, Hector. 
 It's a shame what happened to that kid... 
 Even if he was a punk-ass snitch. 
 You won't get away with it again. 
 I will find a way to bring you down. 
 Good luck with that warrant, detective. 
 Didn't know you collected dolls, Finch. 
 As you know, I collect rare books, Mr. Reese. 
 180-gram vinyl and a Xerox Alto when I can find one. 
 This doll is for Detective Fusco. 
 Fusco's into dolls? 
 He is now, if we want to keep eyes on Detective Carter. 
 I'll make sure it lands on his desk. 
 I've been looking into our new number. 
 Carter, detective first grade, homicide task force. 
 Single mom, teenage son, served as an army interrogator. 
 Passed the bar in '04, gave it up to go back on the force. 
 It's impressive, Mr. Reese. 
 Impressive lady. 
 Honest to a fault. 
 Which means she made a lot of enemies, both in the criminal world and in her own department. 
 I've narrowed the list of possible suspects to a little over 300 or so. 
 Day in the life of a homicide detective. 
 Any more immediate threats? 
 Hector Alvarez... 
 Indicted for homicide on a case she worked six months ago... 
 Till the charges were dropped. 
 Edward Kovach-- 
 Repeat felon, spouse abuser, whose wife she's taken a keen interest in protecting. 
 And then there's Elias-- 
 Ruthless killer, organized crime boss, who's already taken a shot at her. 
 Well, she's a walking target. 
 Gonna have to keep her in sight at all times. 
 You have to be careful. 
 Get too close, you risk getting caught. 
 That's a chance I got to take. 
 What am I supposed to do, let her catch a bullet? 
 What will you do if she catches you? 
 Well, I'm sure you'll figure something out, Harold. 
 What the hell? 
 [Cell phone ringing] 
 Detective Fusco. 
 Happy birthday, Lionel. 
 Thanks, but no thanks. It's not my birthday. 
 I don't know what the hell you're trying to tell me here. 
 Just putt on your desk and face it towards Carter. 
 Why? 
 'Cause there's a camera inside, and we need to know everyone she's talking to. 
 You know something I don't? 
 She in trouble? 
 Well, you tell me. 
 Ask around with some of your corrupt pals inside the force. 
 Hey, what's going on? What do you need? 
 I need to find out who might want to take Carter out. 
 Whoa, wait a minute. 
 I can't be involved in something like that. 
 No, Lionel, just turn the camera towards her desk. 
 [Sighs] 
 Nice doll. 
 Yeah, my, uh-- 
 My son gave it to me. 
 How'd it go with the old Don at the big house? 
 Tried to reach out, see what he knew about his biological son. 
 Elias, huh? 
 Old man just shut me down. 
 Seems to think every cop is dirty. 
 [Sighs] Yeah. 
 Maybe back in his day. 
 That bodega owner Castillo come in yet? 
 Not that I know of. 
 Huh. 
 Gonna have to pay him another visit. 
 You coming? 
 Nah, you know what? 
 Why don't you, uh, go ahead? I-I got a thing. 
 I'll catch up with you later, okay? 
 Okay. 
 [Siren wails] 
 Whoa, whoa, whoa! 
 Come here. 
 Yo, I ain't done nothing. 
 Hands where I can see 'em. 
 Get off. 
 Got any needles? Anything that's gonna stick me? 
 This is violation of my civil liberties. 
 Finch, I don't like the looks of this. 
 Aah! 
 Bitch, you better get your hands off me. 
 Shut up and get your head down. 
 Yo, thanks for making it look good, detective. 
 I think I tweaked my wrist, man. 
 That was a little too theatrical, Bottlecap. 
 Hey-- 
 Wait a minute, Reese. 
 I think she knows him. 
 It's all for show. 
 Must be one of her CIS. 
 That's 'cause after I last got popped, I used my time to rehabilitate myself. 
 You got clean? 
 Come on now, BC. 
 I'm serious. 
 These pipes are junk-free. 
 But I can always use some scratch, you know what I'm saying? 
 I need to know what you've heard about the new guy Elias. 
 Yeah, I've been hearing that name up and coming a lot. 
 I never seen him, but I-I hear he's a man not to be trifled with. 
 You, um, know anything about that shooting last night over on 168th and Audubon? 
 Drive-by, right? 
 I know the block, just not the players. 
 You ever hear the name Hector Alvarez come up or see him cruise the block in his GTO? 
 I didn't see the car or hear nobody talk about Hector, but I can ask around. 
 Good looking out, BC. 
 If you get anything back on, um, Hector or Elias, there's more where that came from. 
 Hey, captain. 
 Welcome back, detective. 
 Didn't think you'd grace us with your presence again once you spent time with the perfumed folk downtown. 
 [Laughing] 
 How'd a half-wit like you pull that off? 
 I guess the half's still got some juice, huh, captain? 
 [Chuckling] 
 They got me working with Detective Carter, and, uh... 
 I'm starting to hear some things. 
 Yeah? Like what? 
 Maybe she's not so well-liked by, uh, a certain element. 
 Listen, Lionel... 
 Things are going back to the way they used to be. 
 Used to be? 
 Thing about organized crime? It was organized. 
 Things worked. Trains ran on time. 
 This new guy... 
 He knows the rules. 
 New guy-- 
 You mean Elias. 
 Runs a tight ship... 
 Low profile. 
 Not like these cutthroat Russian idiots. 
 He knows who to grease... 
 All the way up to city hall. 
 Look, the economy's in the toilet. 
 Detective Carter doesn't understand the rules. 
 She's bad for business. 
 What'd she do? 
 Sniffing around... 
 Trying to build a case. 
 She's gunning for Elias. She's got to go. 
 It's a tricky business, getting rid of a cop. 
 Went through the proper back channels... 
 Up the chain of command. 
 Permission granted. 
 It's just got to look... 
 Clean. 
 "Clean"? 
 You mean like in the line of duty? 
 I'm starting to feel caught in the middle here, captain. 
 I'd keep my distance, if I were you. 
 You didn't come down to the precinct like you told me you would, Mr. Castillo. 
 I got no help today. I'm a very busy man. 
 Did you see this car before or after the shooting? 
 You didn't tell me that the guy that they killed was a witness to another shooting. 
 He decided not to testify. Didn't save him. 
 If you think that's gonna convince me to, it's not helping. 
 The point is... 
 If Hector Alvarez thinks you saw him shoot someone, he's gonna come after you too. 
 Please. Look, I have a family. 
 Exactly. 
 If you help me, I can protect you and your family. 
 If you don't... 
 He could still come after you. 
 What's the word, Lionel? 
 I did some checking around. 
 Carter's name came up and not in a good way. 
 Elias wants her gone... Today. 
 Killing a cop brings a lot of heat. 
 Yeah, which is why they're gonna make it look clean. 
 He could set up a patsy or pay someone off on a case she's working. 
 All I know is, every door that Carter walks through could have a bullet behind it. 
 Did you see this guy in your store last night? 
 Please. That's all I need. 
 I saw him earlier. 
 He's been in my store before, to buy condoms, beer. 
 What does it mater? 
 I'm not gonna give you a statement anyways. 
 Can you please leave my store? 
 
 
 
 Okay. 
 Okay. Thank you. 
 [Hector wolf-whistles] 
 Oh, sorry, detective. 
 I didn't realize that was you from behind. 
 Lot of fine girls out today. 
 Keep it moving, lover boy. 
 You got to be careful on this block. 
 I heard some kid got popped last night. 
 You got any kids, detective? 
 Stay off this block. 
 I see this car roll by one more time, I'm gonna impound it. 
 I'll be seeing you around, Mr. Castillo. 
 [Imitates gunshot] 
 Get out of here. 
 Let's go. 
 Elias wants Carter gone. 
 Possible he'll use someone with motive... 
 The suspect in one of her cases. 
 Carter's at a bar. 
 I thought she was on duty. 
 With this many people after her, I'd be inclined to pick up the tab. 
 Tell me, Eddie... 
 What kind of degenerate does that to his wife? 
 Carter's paying Kovach a visit. 
 Why is a homicide detective intervening in a domestic case? 
 Maybe she's like us. 
 Trying to prevent something bad from happening. 
 What happens between a man and his woman behind closed doors is none of your damn business. 
 Can't stop you from boozing your life away. 
 But you go home and put your hands on your wife again, I'm coming after you. 
 You come after me, and I will exercise my second amendment rights. 
 And I promise you, I got a pretty big gun. 
 Man as angry and bitter as you are... 
 I got a feeling it ain't that big, Eddie. 
 I got to admit, Finch, I sure like her style. 
 I think we got a new front-runner. 
 Mark Thomson, Ricky Lopez, Joseph McNally... 
 All were killed from a suicide vest you helped transport. 
 They had families... 
 People that loved them. 
 I'm sorry for the soldiers, but I deliver vegetables. 
 I know you're working with Al-Qaeda, Yusuf... 
 'Cause I have photos here of you loading vests into your truck. 
 Now, you want to tell me all these photos of you are fake? 
 Hmm? 
 Show me where the other suicide vests are hidden, Yusuf. 
 Point to the location. 
 [Sighs] 
 Do you know what they will do if they find out that I helped you? 
 They will kill my wife. 
 They will kill my son. 
 I would rather you just kill me now. 
 Carter, is that the DOA's phone-- 
 Ronnie Middleton? 
 His mother hasn't even come to the morgue. 
 This kid was all alone. 
 He deserved better. 
 So far, I've got nothing on Hector. 
 Analyst from the real-time crime center sent over footage from some of the cameras around Bodega La Nueva. 
 Some? 
 There's more cameras than this? 
 Yeah. Mayor wants one on every corner. 
 Wow, no wonder I feel like I'm always being watched. 
 I figured Hector's GTO had to pass through this intersection, but nothing,  nada. 
 Maybe he didn't drive. Maybe he walked. 
 Castillo said he came into his market a couple times to purchase some booze and trojans. 
 So? 
 His girlfriend lives in the Bronx too. 
 Why would he have to go 25 blocks downtown for condoms? 
 'Cause Don Juan got a little chicky on the side. 
 Hmm. 
 Hector was on foot. 
 Maybe he walked from her apartment to the market. 
 And that's where Hector bumped into Ronnie. 
 If we can find this  chica,  we might have ourselves a new witness. 
 I'm gonna make some phone calls. 
 [Cell phone ringing] 
 Look, I got to go. 
 You can thank me later, all right? 
 [Chuckles] 
 Hello. What, do you miss me already? 
 You're a hard man to miss, Lionel. 
 I'd say this Carter situation's got you worried. 
 What are you gonna do, follow her around from now on? 
 I'm not. You are. 
 I've got some business to take care of. 
 Don't let her get in any trouble. 
 Carter's gunning for you. 
 Hell, she's probably gonna catch you. 
 Why you spending so much time trying to protect her? 
 She's a good cop... 
 Good person. 
 Hell, you should try it sometime, Lionel. 
 Yeah, thanks, look, I'm just saying, if she wasn't around, it would probably solve a lot of your problems, now, wouldn't it? 
 If anything happens to her, Lionel, I'm coming for you next. 
 What the-- 
 Knock, knock. 
 What do we have here? 
 Hector's a busy man-- 
 Fixing cars and running guns. 
 Who are you, man? 
 Tell Hector I'm the guy that just put him out of business. 
 If I see him again, I'll close down more than the shop. 
 [Tires squeal] 
 If you help us, I can protect you and your family. 
 I promise. 
 This is just a negotiation for you. 
 You don't care about me or my family. 
 Your son-- 
 He's named after you. 
 He's turning 8 in 14 days, right? 
 Favorite sport? Soccer. 
 But it's too dangerous to play in the field by you. 
 Your only brother, Naji, was killed nine months ago by an IED. 
 You visit his grave every day. 
 So, you see... 
 You are not just a negotiation... 
 Not to me. 
 Do you have children? 
 A son. Taylor. 
 Would you trust his life to a complete stranger? 
 I'd do whatever was in my power to protect him. 
 You lost your brother, Yusuf. 
 [Sighs] 
 I lost someone very close to me too. 
 It changed everything. 
 You and me... 
 We're not that different. 
 No. 
 [Chuckles] 
 We want the same thing. 
 For our children to walk down the street and not be afraid. 
 Show me where those explosives are. 
 The location is not on the map. 
 Then you'll take us to them. 
 For our children. 
 For our children. 
 Hey, BC. 
 You got anything on Hector's new woman? 
 Relax. Fusco's all right. 
 Easy there, hubcap. I don't bite. 
 All right, let's make this quick. 
 I seen Hector's GTO outside the lookie-loo. 
 Turns out he's bumping one of the dancers-- Mei Li. 
 If you ask ask me, Hector got a little tired of his  chica  and wanted some strange. 
 [Chuckles] You done good. 
 Uh, I thought you said... 
 You know, real money... 
 Reward money. 
 Okay. 
 Well, if this pans out, I will get you that reward money. 
 I'll meet you later, even take you to dinner at your favorite spot. 
 All right. 
 Yeah, but only 'cause it's you. 
 You always been good to me, Carter. 
 Okay. Take care. 
 Yes, me and Hector was together all night. 
 We watched tv, and then we went to bed. 
 What'd you watch? 
 I don't know. 
 Hector's always changing the channels. 
 I heard that about that guy. 
 He gets bored, he likes to switch it up, huh? 
 [Chuckles] Is that why he has that other girl on the side? 
 No, no, no. 
 You see, my man don't step out on me. 
 I'll cut it off. 
 Ooh, okay. 
 Come here. I want you to see something. 
 That's Hector's cell phone bill. 
 You know whose number that is? 
 'Cause he dialed it 33 times. 
 I don't know, it's probably one of his homies. 
 That man gossips like a little schoolgirl. 
 Well, it's easy enough to find out. 
 Go ahead. Dial it. 
 So you were with Hector all night. 
 Last night, this morning. 
 Hector's a morning person. 
 He likes to spoon. 
 [Cell phone rings] 
 Hello? 
 Hello? 
 Who is this? 
 [Scoffs] Wait. Who the hell are you? 
 Okay, all right. Whoa, whoa, whoa. 
 Looks like you two got a lot to sort out. 
 Uh, make sure they don't kill each other. 
 Oh, no! 
 Oh, no! 
 You got to be kidding me! 
 Aah! Aah! 
 [All shouting] 
 Carter, looks like you're not the only one who's got a beef with Hector Alvarez. 
 Some guy came into his body shop and shot up the place. 
 Bangers inside got a taste of their own medicines. 
 Said the guy had a submachine gun and a grenade launcher. 
 You believe that? 
 This guy wearing a suit? 
 No, motorcycle jacket. Why? 
 Maybe it's in the cleaners. 
 Hector's wanted for questioning. 
 Suffice it to say, he's, uh, disappeared. 
 [Women shouting] 
 Somebody knows where he is. 
 If I find Hector, I'll give him your best. 
 Hector's on the run. 
 He's not gonna be a problem for Carter anymore. 
 I'm not so sure about that. 
 Carter is now determined to get justice for Ronnie. 
 One way or another, she will find where Hector's hiding. 
 The guy's running guns. 
 [Sighs] Wherever he is, he's heavily armed. 
 And when she goes to arrest him-- 
 I'll just have to get there first. 
 Is everything okay, Mr. Reese? 
 We got into this to stop bad things from happening to good people. 
 Carter's been doing that her whole life. 
 She's not just another number, Finch. 
 Some people the world can't afford to lose. 
 Either one of you ready to make a statement? 
 Yeah, I got a statement. 
 Hector Alvarez is a damn fool if he thinks he can play us both. 
 b*st*rd came to my place, but he went out around midnight. 
 Did he go to the market? 
 What he said. 
 But he came back empty-handed and changed his shirt. 
 You wash this shirt of his? 
 Oh, hell, no. 
 It's all yours along with all his stuff. 
 So where is Hector? 
 He has a warehouse in Queens... 
 On 25th. 
 He hangs out there sometimes when he's expecting a shipment. 
 Call ESU, get a ten standby. 
 I'm gonna see about getting a warrant. 
 [Cell phone ringing] Hello? 
 He's got a gun! 
 Uh, wait a minute. Calm down. 
 I can't understand you. 
 He's got a gun! 
 Get out of there! 
 Oh, God! Please! 
 He's gonna kill me! Hurry! 
 Mrs. Kovach, where are you? 
 In the bathroom! 
 Stay where you are. 
 I'm gonna come and get you. 
 [Dial tone] 
 Hello? Hello? 
 Carter's going to the Kovachs' house. 
 He's armed, sounds extremely agitated. 
 Reese? 
 Where are you? 
 All units, we have a code ten. 
 Shots fired at 326 Greentree in Flushing. 
 [Knock on door] NYPD, open up! 
 Sure we shouldn't wait for backup? 
 I got a bad feeling about this. 
 Mr. Kovach... 
 It's the police. Put down your weapon. 
 What the hell? 
 [Moaning] 
 Somebody gift-wrapped him for us. 
 Somebody's been doing that a lot lately. 
 Mrs. Kovach? 
 Mrs. Kovach? 
 [Crying softly] 
 Mrs. Kovach, are you okay? 
 He was gonna kill me. If that man hadn't shown up-- 
 "That man"? What'd he look like? 
 [Phone rings] Hello? 
 It's for you. 
 I guess I have you to thank for this. 
 How do you always know when something bad's about to go down? 
 You're in trouble, detective. 
 I'm not the one who's hiding. 
 Look, you keep playing God, and sooner or later, an innocent person's gonna get hurt. 
 I can't let that happen. 
 Listen, I didn't call to talk about me. 
 Your life's in danger. 
 I'm a cop. My life's always in danger. 
 You're not listening to me. 
 I'm trying to tell you someone wants you dead. 
 Who told you that? 
 Why are you following me? What do you want? 
 I want you to start being more careful. 
 For instance, if you're gonna take down Hector Alvarez, you should know the man's running guns. 
 He has an arsenal at his fingertips. 
 What-- Why are you helping me? 
 And how do you keep finding out all of this information? 
 Like you said... 
 I always seem to know. 
 [Motorcycle engine revving] 
 I never saw his face. 
 He came out of nowhere. 
 He attacked me. You people can't arrest me. 
 Yes, we can. 
 Your wife is pressing charges, Eddie. 
 We get a warrant on Hector Alvarez yet? 
 Yep, ESU's standing by. Who died? 
 Finch, Carter's called an ESU unit to Hector's warehouse in queens. 
 They're getting ready to knock on the door as we speak. 
 It's time to roll. Stay here. 
 I'll advise you when we have Alvarez apprehended. 
 You have eyes on Carter? 
 She's clear of the line of fire. 
 If Hector puts up a fight, it could be dangerous. 
 How will you be close enough to protect her? 
 Oh, I'm... 
 Pretty close. 
 They got this place covered, right? 
 Absolutely. 
 Cover's going in. 
 Everybody set? 
 Yes, sir. 
 Open it. 
 Do it. 
 Move! Move! Move! NYPD! 
 [Gunfire] 
 Down on the ground now! 
 That doesn't sound good. 
 [Engine revving] 
 You hear something around back? 
 [Tires squealing] 
 [Tires screeching] 
 [Crash] 
 Get out of the car. 
 Suspect apprehended. 
 Take it easy. 
 Everything all right, Mr. Reese? 
 Hector's got a new set of bracelets. 
 Should keep him busy for a while. 
 [Grunts] 
 That's for Ronnie. 
 I told you I'd get you. 
 Oh, God. 
 Hey, Taylor, baby. I'm running a little late. 
 I'll be there soon. 
 Sounds like Carter's headed home. 
 Made it through the day. 
 Have we eliminated the threat yet? 
 Kovach and Alvarez are neutralized. 
 But this is a tricky case. 
 To be perfectly honest, I'm just... 
 Not sure. 
 Finch, Carter lives uptown. 
 So why is she headed downtown? 
 Wait a minute. 
 Where'd she go? 
 I lost her. 
 Track her phone for me. 
 Where you been? 
 You said you was gonna buy me dinner. 
 Where you been? I been waiting. 
 I'm sorry, BC. I got to fill out a requisition for the big payout. 
 But look, why don't you take whatever I got? 
 No, that's all right. You ain't got to do all that. 
 Let's just call this a down payment, okay? 
 I want you to have that. 
 I'm sorry, Carter. 
 You always been good to me, but I ain't got no choice. 
 You told me to find that guy Elias. 
 Well, I found him. 
 Sorry. 
 [Gasping] 
 He said it's either gonna be you or me. 
 And it ain't gonna be me. 
 Look alive, Carter. 
 About all that's left of that storage facility your friend took us to. 
 You found the explosives. 
 Found and detonated. 
 I, uh, couldn't have done what you did, getting information from that raghead. 
 Where's Yusuf? 
 Yeah, he, uh... Didn't make it back. 
 Accidents happen. 
 [Scoffs] He trusted me. 
 I gave him my word. I-I promised I'd protect him. 
 You shouldn't make promises you can't keep. 
 Come on, you don't think this guy was innocent, do you? 
 He had a family. 
 Don't you care what happens to them? 
 It's not my job to care. 
 What is wrong with you? 
 You can't just play God! 
 You don't get to decide who lives and who dies! 
 You want to stand on your high horse, go ahead. 
 But don't expect me and my men to back you up. 
 It's a long war. 
 And you're all alone. 
 Glad you took my advice about wearing that vest, detective. 
 I know this doesn't change anything. 
 I know you'll still arrest me if you get the chance. 
 But you should know, whether you like me or not, Joss, you're not alone. 
 Elias got to Carter's CI. 
 Turned him into his triggerman. 
 Is she safe? 
 For now. 
 Time to end this, Finch, once and for all. 
 Aah! 
 Body falls from this height, it's messy. 
 Of course, I don't care about making it look clean... 
 Unlike your pal Elias. 
 I don't know who you are, but you're threatening a captain. 
 Okay, okay, okay. 
 Elias can't kill a cop without permission. 
 Run this up the chain of command. 
 Permission's been revoked. 
 Tell Elias if he so much as touches Detective Carter again, I will put him, you... 
 Everyone in the ground. 
 You got that? 
 Yeah. 
 Oh. Oh. 
 Grandma said you were late for curfew again. 
 Oh, come on, ma. You're serious? 
 I was at a dance. 
 Is she pretty? 
 Better be smart too. 
 Smart and pretty. 
 You all right, mom? 
 Did you pull your back or something? 
 It's nothing that won't heal. 
 Sorry I missed it, t. 
 You work too hard. You should quit. 
 Wouldn't know how to if I tried. 
 I don't like it-- 
 You out there every day. 
 Who's got your back? 
 You don't have to worry about me. 
 I can take care of myself. 
 Besides... 
 We got each other. 
 Who else do we need? 
 Stay tuned for scenes from our next episode.
