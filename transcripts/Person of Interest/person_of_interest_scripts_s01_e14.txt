 You are being watched... 
 The government has a secret system-- 
 A machine that spies on you every hour of every day. 
 I know, because I built it. 
 I designed the machine to detect acts of terror, but it sees everything... 
 Violent crimes involving ordinary people, people like you, crimes the government considered irrelevant. 
 They wouldn't act, so I decided I would. 
 But I needed a partner-- 
 Someone with the skills to intervene. 
 Hunted by the authorities, we work in secret. 
 You'll never find us. 
 But victim or perpetrator, if your number's up, we'll find you. 
 911. What is your emergency? 
 Got a flat tire. 
 They won't turn their music down. 
 I just know he's sleeping with her. 
 Please help me! It's my brother. 
 They shot him. Please, send someone. 
 We're sorry. All circuits are busy at this time. 
 Nobody here. 
 I've never seen you like this. 
 That hacker must have gotten to you. 
 Only the paranoid survive-- 
 Sage advice. 
 Well, I'll need to rebuild all my systems from scratch, reinforce the firewall. 
 Anything I can do? 
 Yes. 
 New number... 
 Just came in this morning. 
 Even with the library offline? 
 His name is Darren McGrady, 14 years old. 
 That's his last known address. 
 You better get started. 
 [Power drill whirring] 
 Hey, Finch... 
 No. Why? 
 Because I had to crawl through police tape to get inside Darren's apartment. 
 The library may have been compromised, but I can assure you that the machine was not. 
 Whatever happened there, Darren's situation must be ongoing. 
 Looks like a home invasion. 
 So whose blood is on the floor? 
 Hey. Who are you? 
 Detective Stills. 
 You the super? 
 That's right. 
 A little late for the party, aren't you? 
 Mind telling me what happened here? 
 What it looks like-- 
 One of my tenants got shot... 
 About a week ago. 
 Older kid-- 
 Travis McGrady. 
 Damn shame. 
 Real good about paying rent on time. 
 Travis had a younger brother, Darren. 
 What happened to him? 
 I don't know. 
 Cops took him with them. 
 Hey, when can I clean this place up and get a new tenant in here? 
 Morning, Detective. 
 Miss me? 
 You know, I always pictured you in the back of my car... In handcuffs. 
 Well, to each his own. 
 Any luck pulling that file? 
 Travis McGrady-- 
 Took two shots to the chest, point blank. 
 Three black males were seen fleeing the building. 
 What about the brother, Darren? 
 Came home right after it happened, found Travis bleeding out. 
 Says here he called 911. 
 Yeah, it took half an hour for first responders to show up. 
 Travis was already dead. 
 What happened to the parents? 
 No father in the picture. 
 Mother died of renal failure three years ago, so Travis was Darren's legal guardian. 
 Now he's got nobody. 
 Any idea where he is now? 
 Missing. 
 Kid waited all night at the precinct for Child Services. 
 When they didn't show up, he just up and walked out. 
 I need to track him down... 
 Fast. 
 Hey. 
 You ever gonna tell me exactly how you and your friend pick the people you're chasing? 
 All right. 
 I'll talk to the detective assigned on the case, see if there's anything he left out of that report. 
 Like how he lost the kid. 
 Since when does a homicide task force want in on a shooting in Crown Heights? 
 Don't you have something more high profile to work-- 
 Like that guy who's kneecapping everybody? 
 Chief of "D"s wants to polish compstat numbers-- 
 Ordered us to climb on any open cases. 
 Okay. It goes like this. 
 Last Friday the victim was working at the-- 
 Travis, right? 
 His name is Travis. 
 Right. 
 Well, this Travis-- 
 He's working the late shift at the Thighs & Fries. 
 Got into an altercation with three males over some waitress. 
 Somebody got frisky, Travis went at him, tossed him out the joint. 
 Same three guys seen later fleeing his apartment building. 
 I figure they left the restaurant. 
 They followed Travis on his way home from work. 
 You know the rest. 
 The little brother-- He said, uh, they took his work hat. 
 Any leads on the three suspects? 
 Waitress give a description, anything? 
 In that neighborhood? 
 Are you kidding? 
 Ain't nobody gonna dime out those thugs. 
 Any progress on finding the little brother, Darren? 
 I don't have time to chase after every kid who can't sit still. 
 Of course not. 
 When I find him, I'll let him know you were a big help. 
 Sounds like Darren's brother picked a fight with the wrong crowd. 
 If they think Darren saw anything that night, they'll be looking to silence him next. 
 So we don't have a clue where Darren is or who the shooters are. 
 Witnesses can ID the shooters. 
 They're just too scared. 
 Why would they want to talk to you? 
 I have my ways. 
 Excuse me. 
 Lisa? 
 Sorry. I'm running late for something. 
 Besides, I already told the police everything I know about Travis and those guys. 
 I'm not a cop. 
 I'm looking for Darren McGrady, Travis' little brother. 
 I'm sorry. I can't help you. 
 I know you're afraid... 
 Just like I'm sure Travis was scared when he stuck up for you against those thugs. 
 But he did it anyway. 
 Those guys come in there all the time, grabbing and hollering. 
 I don't know what the hell he was thinking. 
 He cared for you... 
 Just like he cared for his little brother, Darren. 
 The guys that killed Travis may be coming after Darren now. 
 I need your help tracking them down. 
 Look, I want to help, but-- 
 You don't have to give me a name. 
 Just point me in the right direction. 
 Guy like you, coming out of the shadows, looking for bad guys, you'd fit right in at the comic book store... 
 Couple blocks that way. 
 They hang out there. 
 Thanks. 
 Okay, kids, free comics. 
 There you go-- 
 One for you. 
 How about that? 
 Hey. Good to see you again. 
 All right. Say hi to your mom. 
 Mr. Wilcox, what's this dude's superpower? 
 He got no costume, no cape. 
 'Cause being a superhero is not about a cape or a cowl. 
 It's about protecting your fellow man, looking out for him when no one else will. 
 Look at the detail on that. 
 Uh... Excuse you. 
 Hey, Carter, I may have found one of our shooters-- 
 Corner of Crown and Albany, headed south. 
 I'm two minutes away, be right there. 
 Finch, I got eyes on Darren. 
 Is he safe, Mr. Reese? 
 Not for long. 
 Hey, yo, Brick. 
 Take off that hat. 
 Who do you think you're talking to, shorty? 
 One of the spineless punks that killed my brother-- 
 Shot him dead in our home. 
 Want me to show you how to use that thing, little man? 
 [Gunshot] 
 What the hell you doing, man? Get off of me. 
 This fool is as good as dead. 
 Yo... 
 I won't miss. 
 Give that back! 
 Drop your phone. 
 Get off me, man. 
 Hey, don't worry, man. This ain't over. 
 I'ma kill you and the rest of your crew. 
 Yeah, we'll see about that. 
 My boys will be looking for you. 
 I see you made friends as usual. 
 Found our missing kid. 
 Now I got to get him out of here. 
 He's your murder suspect. 
 Get down on the ground. 
 Put your hands behind your head now. 
 [Sirens wailing] 
 Where you going? 
 Got to get him somewhere safe. 
 Sorry. 
 All units, please respond to shots fired in the vicinity of Crown and-- 
 [Radio turns off] 
 Didn't know cops could pick and choose which calls to answer. 
 Never said I was a cop. 
 So what are you, then? 
 One of these days I'll have to come up with a good answer for that one. 
 It's a nice piece, considering you bought it off the street. 
 Where'd you get the cash? 
 Pawned a TV, sold some stuff. 
 Saw you play the trumpet. 
 I'm guessing you pawned that too. 
 You any good? 
 What do you think? 
 My brother wanted me to go to music school... 
 Instead of getting mixed up with the thugs. 
 And here you are, mixed up with the thugs. 
 So you tracked down that Brick kid. 
 You think that's what your brother would have wanted you to do? 
 Saw him wearing that hat like it was some type of scalp. 
 It wasn't right. 
 I'll take care of it. 
 You? 
 [Scoffs] How? 
 [Engine turning] 
 Wait a minute. Where we going? 
 Darren, this is Detective Fusco. 
 He's a...Friend. 
 This guy? 
 Yep. 
 Oh, hell, no. 
 What's your problem, half pint? 
 You're a dirty cop all day long. 
 All right, look... 
 First you got me investigating our mutual friend. 
 Now I got to babysit this disrespectful punk? 
 I have a day job. 
 Carter's gonna start asking a lot more questions. 
 You leave Carter to me. 
 Now, is this place safe? 
 Yeah. She likes to help kids. 
 She hates paperwork. 
 She takes in strays all the time. 
 I'm not a stray. 
 He'll be safe here. 
 Good. 
 I'll be back, but until then, he doesn't leave your sight. 
 Yo, you really gonna leave me here? 
 Not for long. 
 Got to return a vehicle. 
 Brick. 
 Bad luck. 
 You walking around wearing a dead guy's hat. 
 Where'd you get it? 
 Found it. 
 Where? 
 In the street. I like the way it fit. 
 Yeah, well, that hat is in the lab right now. 
 DNA always tells the truth. 
 Better for both of us if I heard it from you. 
 It takes three months to get those results back, so either we're gonna get cozy in here, or you can just give me my phone call now. 
 Phone's busted-- 
 Budget cuts. 
 You know how these things go. 
 Whatever. 
 You can't hold me if you can't charge me. 
 Yeah, that's right. 
 You've done all this before, right? 
 Yeah, well, you're right about one thing. 
 You'll get out of here... 
 When I take you to your arraignment.

 You're trying to reach your friend Brick. 
 Hello, Curtis. 
 Nice cars, cash in envelopes-- 
 These guys aren't street thugs, Finch. 
 They've got some kind of operation. 
 Any way to run the plates? 
 I'm still rebuilding the drives. 
 Had to make a hardware run. 
 If all goes well, we're looking at a couple of hours. 
 Good. I'll check with Detective Fusco. 
 Is everything all right, Finch? 
 Just fine, Mr. Reese. 
 Mr. Wren, a man is here to see you-- A Mr. Ingram. 
 Of course. Bring him in, please. 
 Will. How are you? 
 I'm well, Uncle Harold. 
 As are you, evidently. 
 Business must be booming. 
 Happily, yes. 
 In the insurance business, the fewer bad things that happen in the universe, the more money we make. 
 Let me tie up a few loose ends, and then we'll go to lunch. 
 Take your time. 
 I almost finished sorting through all dad's stuff. 
 Find anything interesting? 
 One or two things I'm sure he would have wanted you to have. 
 Mostly it was boring stuff, except-- except for this, which is just strange. 
 "Day one: The machine, February 24, 2005." 
 It's interesting, isn't it? 
 Is it? 
 I told you I'm looking into that period when dad shut down operations at the company. 
 This is right in the middle of that. 
 Now, obviously he was celebrating something, but what? 
 A machine? The machine? 
 I wouldn't know. You know your dad-- 
 Any excuse for champagne. 
 Well, I guess you're right. 
 But there's still one person who I think of who might know. 
 You probably know her too... 
 Alicia Corwin? 
 No. I don't think so. 
 Hers is the only name that appears in any of the files during that seven-year blackout, and she worked for the White House. 
 I guess they were in touch about something. 
 Have you been in contact with her? 
 It wasn't easy. 
 After she quit her job at the government a year ago after dad died, she moved to this remote town in West Virginia-- 
 Green Bank. 
 Never heard of it. 
 Me neither. 
 Turns out it's the only place in the US. 
 That doesn't have cell phones or wireless Internet. 
 Apparently, they do something to the radio telescopes. 
 Are you sure you're not chasing shadows here, Will? 
 Maybe, except for one thing. 
 Remember that contract that dad signed with the government for $1? 
 It's the next day-- 
 February 25th, 2005. 
 Wow. 
 Well, that is something. 
 I'm finished here, and I'm starving. 
 [Cell phone beeps] 
 Let's get out of here. 
 [Camera shutter clicks] 
 [Cell phone rings] 
 Detective Fusco. 
 You're kidding me. When? 
 [Cell phone rings] 
 Hello, Lionel. 
 Hey, I just got a call from the group home. 
 Darren's missing. 
 What do you mean? I told you to check on him. 
 I've been checking on him every hour. 
 Why do you think they called me? Kid must have just walked out. 
 Kid's got a habit of doing that. 
 Yeah, well, just for the record, this is not my fault. 
 Too busy playing private investigator for you. 
 And how's that going? 
 Interesting. 
 I'll tell you when I know more. 
 What are we gonna do about this kid? 
 I think I know where he might be headed. 
 Yo, Hops & Barley... 
 Looking for a couple punks-- 
 Curtis and Trim. You know 'em? 
 Say what? 
 You heard me-- 
 Curtis and Trim. 
 I'm calling 'em out. 
 You trying to get yourself killed, Scrappy Doo? 
 You're beginning to wear my last nerve. 
 You might be scared of 'em, but I'm not. 
 You about to get yourself tossed, dwarf. 
 Not unless you care to follow him. 
 Why not let the kid go? 
 And if I don't? 
 Oh, boom! 
 Pow! 
 Yo, now, that was some straight-up Shaolin and wu-tang whup-ass. 
 What kind of fighting style is that? 
 You're a smart, talented kid, Darren. 
 You got to promise me that you'll stop looking for these guys. 
 It's too dangerous for you out there. 
 What's this? 
 It's all I got left. 
 I want to hire you to help me take down those guys who killed my brother. 
 So, if I'm not a cop, I'm a mercenary, is that it? 
 No, I figured it out. 
 You're a ronin. 
 A ronin? 
 Yeah, a ronin. 
 It's like-- 
 It's like a samurai with no master. 
 Technically, you should have killed yourself. 
 That's the code. 
 But instead you're out wandering the land, helping people. 
 So now I'm paying you to help me. 
 I'm not for hire. 
 You can't stop me from going after them. 
 But I have a better chance with you there. 
 There's no way to convince you to just lie low, huh? 
 You can keep your money. 
 Nah, man. 
 Take it. 
 It makes it official. 
 No. 
 If we're gonna do this, we're gonna do it my way. 
 That means no killing. 
 This is my going rate. 
 All right, man, deal. 
 Look, you're working for me now. I ought to know your name. 
 Uh, you can call me.. 
 Reese. 
 What's he doing, man? 
 Yo, yo, hey! Keep your dirty ass away from my clean car. 
 My bad! My bad! 
 Yo... 
 I didn't hire you to just sit here and watch. 
 When are we gonna take them down? 
 We've already started. Step one-- Observe. 
 The most efficient way to lose a fight is to act without knowing your enemy. 
 Oh... 
 Payday, old man. 
 It's all there-- 
 $300. 
 That's protection. 
 Where's the rest? 
 Oh, come on, guys. 
 If the state found out I was selling those tickets, I'd lose my legit lottery business. 
 Tickets? 
 Yeah, they're running numbers through local shop owners, but they take all the money, tax-free. 
 The cops know about this, or they just don't care? 
 Probably giving them a cut to turn a blind eye. 
 You short Andre, you'll lose a lot more. 
 Who's Andre? 
 I don't know. 
 Man, these cops let these guys do whatever they want-- 
 Kill my brother, walk around like they can't be touched. 
 But now we know how they're making their money. 
 So they just got a lot less untouchable. 
 Ah... 
 "Observe." 
 To tell you the truth, I've always hated observing. 
 Wait here. 
 
 
 
 You paying up, or we got a problem? 
 Hurry up, pops. 
 Just a couple more to go, man, we'll be good. 
 [Engine turning, revs] 
 Yo! Oh, whoa! 
 That's my car! 
 [Cell phone rings] 
 That was step two, kid. 
 Meet me at the corner of Rutland and 52nd. 
 Hey, what's up, man? Where's Trim's car? 
 Strategically stored. 
 I just needed to shake 'em up a bit... 
 See what comes loose. 
 Cool, cool. 
 [Cell phone rings] 
 I need GPS on their cell. 
 Just a minute. 
 I'm not sure I'm in favor of your troubling arrangement with young Darren. 
 I'm not sure I'm in favor of our troubling arrangement, especially when you disappear on mysterious business. 
 GPS is up, Mr. Reese. 
 Who are you talking to? 
 Tech support. Come on. 
 Hey, you ever kill anyone? 
 Yes. 
 Were they bad? 
 Some... 
 Not all. 
 Some? 
 That means your master tricked you, told you to kill bad people that really weren't. 
 A lot of ronin ended up that way. 
 You know what I think, T? 
 I think your ride's gone, yo. 
 Shut up, Curtis. 
 So...Step three? 
 To impose your will on your enemy, make for their weak points. 
 Oh. Talking  art of war. 
 You read Sun Tzu? 
 Of course, man. All samurai know Sun Tzu. 
 Come on, man. 
 Just get a new car. 
 Call for the insurance. 
 What insurance? 
 You were with me when I stole the damn thing. 
 Yeah, but you bought those rims. 
 They might replace those. 
 Get your dumb ass up, man. 
 Chill, man! 
 Go get your grandma's beater and meet me at Andre's. 
 Big money run tonight. 
 Steps four and five-- 
 Find the boss and figure out how to hurt him. 
 Come on. 
 What's the story on that banger you're holding? 
 You got a charge yet? 
 His name came up in a shooting. 
 I'm just waiting for a photo packet. 
 We have until tomorrow to arraign him, captain. 
 I'm still collecting evidence. 
 You're reaching, Carter. 
 If that kid's not arraigned by 5:00, I want you to kick him. 
 Yo, Reese, there's Trim. 
 What's he doing back here? 
 Now, remember, it's not about the superpowers. 
 It's about who protects you and who keeps you safe. 
 Go on home. 
 Man, they got Mr. Wilcox selling those tickets too? 
 I'm not sure it's that simple. 
 You're late. 
 Had a little car trouble, Andre. 
 That's Andre? 
 The higher up you go, the harder it gets to tell the good guys from the bad. 
 Police still got Brick? 
 Let me worry about Brick. 
 What's with the beater you rolled up in? 
 Uh, it's my grandma's. 
 You're gonna move half a million dollars of my money in that piece-- 
 That's why we got it, Andre-- 
 Switching up the cars, switching up the routes, just to be safe. 
 I still smell you lying a mile away. 
 No, for real. 
 Since the cops got Brick, we thought maybe-- 
 You don't need to worry about Brick. 
 All you need to do is worry about me. 
 Do whatever I tell you to do, get me whatever I want, and right now I want my damn money in Brighton Beach tonight. 
 Now y'all mess that up, and I'm gonna kill you both. 
 Now we know who's weak, who's in charge, and how to hurt him. 
 What's step six, man? 
 Well, that's the fun part. Come on. 
 [Hip-hop music] 
 ♪ 
 Yo, you think Brick's gonna talk? 
 Brick is cool. 
 Andre will protect him. 
 Andre will take care of all of us, as long as we take care of him. 
 Yo... 
 Trim, ain't that your ride? 
 Found your car. 
 [Bottles clanking] 
 [Laughing] 
 Son of a bitch. 
 Wrong place to sleep it off, buddy. 
 You and I need to talk. 
 In the middle of something, Carter. 
 I heard about your little traffic accident. 
 What have you gotten that kid mixed up in? 
 Don't worry. He wasn't in the car. 
 That boy is a minor. 
 You're responsible for his welfare. 
 You still have Brick? 
 Yeah, Womack thinks I released him this morning. 
 What about that other guy you slammed into last night? 
 He's about to debrief us on Travis McGrady's murder. 
 You can scream if you want. 
 Kiss my ass. 
 Where'd you dump the gun? 
 What gun? 
 The gun you used to kill Travis McGrady. 
 Travis who? 
 This money is supposed to be in Brighton Beach. 
 Trouble is... 
 It's here with you in Crown Heights. 
 Andre's gonna kill you. 
 Do you really think Andre would believe your story? 
 If I were Andre, I'd assume you stole every dime. 
 I'd send people in to find it, then kill you. 
 So the only way you're gonna survive is if you come back with every last dime. 
 So who killed Travis McGrady? 
 Right now your life is worth a half a million dollars. 
 $20,000 of it... 
 Up in smoke. 
 Where's the gun, Curtis? 
 $50,000 of your life up in smoke. 
 Andre's gonna believe me. 
 Let's find out. 
 What? No! Stop, stop, stop! 
 Where's the murder weapon? 
 Chimney... 
 Top of my grandma's building. 
 It better be. 
 Hello, Will. Long time. 
 Thanks for meeting me, Alicia. 
 Maybe we should go to a cafe or bar-- 
 Somewhere warm. 
 If you don't mind, I prefer it outside. 
 I'm so sorry I couldn't make your father's funeral. 
 I really wanted to be there. 
 It was just a difficult time for me. 
 He was such a lovely man. 
 I just wish I'd known him better. 
 Here. 
 That's why I wanted to meet you. 
 I found it in his things. 
 I wondered if you knew anything about it. 
 Well, he signed a contract with the government the next day for $1. 
 For what? I don't know. 
 It just said "services." 
 But I'm pretty sure that it had something to do with the work he was doing at IFT while they were closed. 
 I was hoping you could tell me. 
 Are you really sure you want to know? 
 Yes, I do. 
 IFT was about to fail. 
 Your dad's investments had backfired. 
 His R&D had produced nothing for years. 
 He came to me for help. 
 I persuaded the government to bail him out in exchange for some of IFT's patents. 
 That's what this is about-- 
 A dollar for dad's patents? 
 I'm afraid so. 
 So this is about the government helping him or screwing him, but why drink champagne? 
 And what does it mean-- 
 "The machine"? 
 Crushed by the machine? 
 I suppose, yes, in a way, he was crushed by the machine-- 
 Going through a divorce, his company collapsing. 
 Your dad was in a dark place. 
 I know it must be tough to think of his final days that way, but let it go, Will. 
 You sound just like my Uncle Harold. 
 I do? 
 Who's he? 
 My dad's best friend-- 
 Harold Wren. 
 Are you sure you two never met? 
 No. 
 We haven't. 
 I have to go. 
 I'm sorry I couldn't be more help. 
 My delivery was intercepted, captain. 
 I'm missing two couriers and half a million dollars in Brighton Beach money. 
 Okay, I need your help. 
 You're on your own with this one. 
 This was out of my control. 
 Force majeure is not covered by our protection. 
 Our associates blame you for this debacle. 
 Fix it...Fast. 
 All right, I'll handle this... 
 On my own. 
 I'm confident in your success. 
 I need something from you. 
 My employee Brick is being held by your people without a charge, okay? 
 I need you to get him out... 
 Unless that's not covered by your protection. 
 I'll see what I can do. 
 How are you, Detective? 
 That's a friend of yours? 
 Yeah. 
 Carter, you still have that suspect in holding? 
 I was just about to let him go. 
 You should have done that hours ago. 
 Not a bright move, Detective. 
 Release the suspect now. 
 Sorry I thought you were a cop. 
 Nothing wrong with cops... 
 Just bad ones. 
 What's that? Look. 
 Something metal right there. 
 We got 'em, kid. 
 It's over. We got the evidence. 
 My friend on the police force will be able to put Brick and his friends away. 
 Yeah, but what about Andre? He's still out there. 
 Andre didn't kill your brother. 
 Now you want to go after him too? 
 Hell, yeah. He's just as to blame. 
 Then what, hmm? 
 Go after Andre's bosses... 
 The corrupt cops and the politicians that let them operate? 
 You won't be able to stop until you destroy everyone you blame for taking your brother's life. 
 It won't bring him back. 
 You'll just wind up in jail or dead. 
 Do you think that's what your brother wanted for you? 
 [Cell phone rings] 
 [Cell phone beeps] 
 There you are. 
 Anonymous tip just came in, Detective. 
 Got you the murder weapon. 
 You can go ahead and charge Brick. 
 It's gonna be kind of difficult. 
 I just released him ten minutes ago. 
 Brick's on the street? 
 Womack forced my hand. 
 He'll be able to ID Darren to Andre. 
 All the more reason why you need to get that kid off the street now. 
 Don't worry-- 
 I'll get you the gun, along with the kid. 
 Darren. 
 What's going on? 
 [Sighs] 
 Carter... 
 You're gonna say, "I told you so." 
 Finch, Darren's run off, probably to go after Brick again. 
 And this time he's got the gun they used to kill his brother. 
 In other words, the idea of letting a 14-year-old hire you to avenge his brother has backfired? 
 You can lecture me later. 
 Right now I need you to bring me the bag. 
 Which bag? 
 The one labeled "plan 'B'". 
 Hey. You need backup? 
 I don't know. Do I? 
 I figured it might've had something to do with that fish the captain had you throw back in the sea. 
 It might. 
 I got a tip. 
 You want to go fishing? 
 Yeah, sure, why not? 
 [Both speaking indistinctly] 
 That's the kid? 
 Darren, right? 
 Yeah, I recognize you. 
 We got something to talk about, right, you and me? 
 Wow. 
 Darren's in there. 
 Relax, Finch. 
 It's bean-bag rounds, riot ammo. 
 I told the kid no killing. 
 On my signal, you're gonna cut the power to the building. 
 That was the signal, Finch. 
 It's pretty brave of you coming in here like that, Darren. 
 I get it. 
 I do. 
 My man took someone from you, so you're here to take him from me. 
 So go ahead and shoot him. 
 I mean, he's the one that screwed up in the first place, even put us in this situation. 
 So you're doing me a favor here. 
 Yo, Andre-- 
 Shut your mouth. 
 I see you got it in you. 
 Yeah, you got that conviction. 
 It's a hard quality to find around here. 
 So you go ahead and pull that trigger. 
 You should come work for me. 
 You're young enough, by the time you Brick's age, you'll be running these streets for me, son. 
 Ain't nobody gonna touch you. 
 You know why? 
 Because you smarter than the rest. 
 Now, you made it all the way here. 
 Go ahead... 
 And claim that reward. 
 Claim it. 
 Man, come on, come on. 
 Yeah, I thought that might happen. 
 I don't blame you. I blame the store. 
 Kids spending their days reading these revenge stories, selling it like it's reality. 
 But you know the thing about comic books? 
 They're just comics. 
 What the hell is that? What the hell is that? 
 Move! 
 [Gunshot] 
 Go around back. 
 NYPD, drop your weapon. 
 Aah! Aah! 
 Get down, kid! 
 Fusco! 
 Fusco, you okay? 
 Yeah, just peachy. 
 Come here. 
 [Indistinct chatter over police radio] 
 You know what? 
 Whatever you got to say, save it. 
 I can already see the ass cake on my desk when I get back. 
 No, man, actually, I just wanted to say thank you for saving my life. 
 You're welcome, kid. 
 Come on. Let's go. Get me out of here. 
 [Groans] 
 Hey, take it easy, will you? 
 Just when I thought you were sticking around. 
 Manhattan, you know... 
 Got a little claustrophobic. 
 And a job's come up in Sudan. 
 I'll be sorry to lose you again. 
 That woman-- 
 I've forgotten her name. 
 Did she tell you what you wanted to know? 
 Alicia Corwin-- 
 She told me some stuff. 
 I don't know if it's what I wanted to know. 
 You know, I had my dad on a pedestal. 
 Loved him, hated him, but just always admired him. 
 It's kind of hard to believe he was just an ordinary guy, made mistakes like everybody else. 
 Well, whatever she told you, there's one thing you should know about him. 
 Anytime anyone ever asked him what his proudest achievement was, he always said that it was you. 
 Thank you. 
 Take care of yourself. 
 Yeah. 
 You know, Fusco tells me they got a lead on a foster family. 
 I had a family. 
 Darren, we don't get to choose what happens to us... 
 Just what we do about it. 
 I looked into them. 
 They're good people. 
 And if they aren't? 
 I'll take care of it. 
 I'm, uh, still on the clock. 
 I'm still working on it, but here... 
 This is yours. 
 Would you look at that? 
 I always wanted a sidekick. 
 Thanks. 
 Which, uh, reminds me... 
 I pulled some strings. 
 You'll be starting at that charter school for the arts. 
 My trumpet. 
 They got drawing classes too. 
 Is that right? 
 Remember, opportunities multiply as they're seized. 
 Sun Tzu... 
 Right. 
 Hey, don't worry, man. 
 Someday you'll find a home too. 
 Thanks. 
 [Knock on window] 
 Come on, kid, they're waiting for you inside. 
 All right, man. 
 What's up, Fusco? 
 Hey, man, I think you're gonna need a bullet in that other cheek to even out that limp. 
 Good to see you too. 
 Hi. 
 Come on. 
 He's a good kid. 
 Think he'll be all right? 
 He's a tough kid. 
 It's a good thing we showed up in time, you know. 
 You're cutting it awfully close with Carter. 
 She's still looking for you, last I checked. 
 Like I said, you let me worry about Carter. 
 Any news on that other thing? 
 Yeah. 
 He's got so many aliases, I don't even know where to start. 
 Oldest one I could find is a Harold Wren. 
 He's an underwriter for an insurance company for a number of years. 
 Before that, MIT student, top of his class. 
 It was there where he met the kid's dad-- 
 You know, Nathan Ingram. 
 He's that billionaire that got killed a couple years back. 
 Ingram... 
 Graduated from the same class as Wren. 
 Yeah, except I did a little more digging. 
 Wren was the name he used freshman year at MIT. 
 That name doesn't appear on any records before '76, which tells me that Wren was a false identity too. 
 This guy spent so much time being someone else, he probably doesn't know who he is anymore. 
 "Only the paranoid survive." 
 You know, Lionel... 
 You could have been a good cop if not for a few bad choices. 
 You got me snooping around your boss, but I make bad choices? 
 Man has a point. 
 Stay tuned for scenes from our next episode.
