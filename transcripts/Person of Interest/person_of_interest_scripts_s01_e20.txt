 You are being watched. 
 The government has a secret system-- 
 A machine that spies on you every hour of every day. 
 I know because I built it. 
 I designed the machine to detect acts of terror, but it sees everything... 
 Violent crimes involving ordinary people, people like you, crimes the government considered irrelevant. 
 They wouldn't act, so I decided I would. 
 But I needed a partner-- 
 Someone with the skills to intervene. 
 Hunted by the authorities, we work in secret. 
 You will never find us. 
 But victim or perpetrator, if your number's up, we'll find you. 
 Tell me where he is. 
 We could do this all night. 
 Look at me. 
 Sooner or later, you're gonna start talking to me. 
 Let's try some nonverbal communication. 
 [Groans] Aah! 
 [Grunts] 
 [Phone dialing, ringing] 
 It's me. Jessica, I mean. 
 I don't even know if you check this number. 
 Um, I need to talk. 
 [Phone beeps] 
 [Phone rings] 
 [Phone ringing] 
 [Exhales heavily] 
 Jessica, I got your message. 
 I didn't know if you'd call me back. 
 We haven't talked in-- 
 What, four years? 
 What's wrong? 
 Is everything okay with Peter? 
 Yeah, he's fine. We're both fine. 
 I just... 
 Needed a friend that I could talk to. 
 Something's wrong. Talk to me. 
 You said that, in the end, we were all alone. 
 I should go. 
 Jess. 
 Bye, John. 
 I'm coming to get you. I'll be there in 24 hours. 
 Wait for me. 
 [Whispering] I'll wait. 
 It all comes down to a matter of trust, the foundation of any healthy relationship. 
 I just need to know where this is headed. 
 Trust is a two-way street, Carter. 
 I know. 
 I do trust you and your friend-- 
 The two people I know the least. 
 It's the job I'm not sure about anymore. 
 I don't know who's got my back on the force. 
 I'm pretty sure the guy across the desk from me is dirty. 
 Well, I'll keep my eye on him. 
 I need to know more, John. 
 I need to know just as much as you and your friend do about these cases we're working. 
 Okay, let's work this one together. 
 This guy over here with his girl? 
 Yeah, only that's not his girl. 
 That's his girl. 
 You worthless, lying dirtbag! 
 [Gasps] 
 [Gunshot] 
 You're under arrest. 
 I thought you said we were working this one together. 
 We are. 
 You're taking care of the shooter, and I'm making sure the cheating boyfriend doesn't get hurt. 
 Looks fine to me. 
 [Scoffs] 
 Mr. Reese, a new number has come in. 
 Have you and Detective Carter wrapped things up on the last one? 
 Just about. 
 You still haven't said why you brought me in. 
 Sit down. 
 Police raffle. You're the big winner. 
 Where's the money you owe? 
 What? We don't pay the police. 
 We kick back to the mob. 
 [Kicking chair] 
 That chapter's closed. You pay HR now. 
 Where is my money? 
 I can't hear you. 
 All right. 
 [Grunts] I'll get your money. 
 But I gotta take you there. 
 You go with him and get it. 
 Based on her remarks at the bar, sounds like Detective Carter is eyeing Fusco. 
 Isn't it time we told her that he's working with HR at our behest? 
 Not yet. 
 And after all that talk about honesty. 
 It's safer for both of them. 
 The less people who know about Fusco, the less danger he's in. 
 So now you're protecting Fusco? 
 I'm protecting an asset. 
 Who's the new number? 
 Tommy Clay. Lives in Queens. 
 Married ten years to wife Joyce. 
 They have a nine-year-old son. 
 No criminal record. 
 He pays his taxes, goes to church every Sunday except during football season. 
 An ordinary guy. What's the threat? 
 Did I mention what our number does for a living? 
 Tommy Clay works for Grayling Armored Services. 
 You'll be a trainee working under him, and today is training day. 
 The crew consists of a driver, Murray Langston, been working at grayling for 20 years. 
 Tommy is the hopper, the most dangerous position on the crew, because he has to leave the truck to pick up and drop off cargo. 
 And then there's the guard, which is you. 
 If the machine gave us Tommy's number... 
 Somebody's probably planning a robbery. 
 73% of all armored car robberies happen when the hopper's away from the truck, so if they're gonna hit you, that's when it'll happen. 
 GSM link established. 
 The plate reader will scan any license in its line of sight. 
 Let us know if anyone's following the truck, casing it for a robbery. 
 First thing, we don't always know what we're carrying. 
 It's not on the manifest? 
 Not specifics, John. Your name's John, right? 
 Sometimes a client tells us what it is. 
 Sometimes they don't. 
 So treat every day as if you're gonna get hit. 
 That's a good philosophy for life. 
 Hey, Murray, Johnny here is a philosopher. 
 Smart. 
 He must have deep thoughts. 
 Just don't get caught napping on my watch. 
 These guys aren't ready for any real threat, Finch. 
 Their vests are loose, magazines are stored the wrong way... 
 We need to put a face to the threat. 
 Cross-checking every plate from the reader to see if they're being followed. 
 You almost look like you know what you're doing. 
 Did you miss me? 
 More than you know. 
 Watch my back, hero. 
 Found something. 
 One plate comes up three times today. 
 Someone's following the truck. 
 I got guys headed this way with guns. 
 Southeast corner. 
 Go, go, go, go. 
 What's happening, Mr. Reese? 
 John, back here! Help! 
 Mr. Reese? 
 [Growling] 
 [Snarling, speaking gibberish] 
 [Laughs] 
 Smile, rookie! 
 Hey, relax, Johnny. 
 [Laughs] 
 That's not a toy, you know. 
 You could kill somebody with that thing. 
 [Laughter] 
 All right, you got me. 
 False alarm, Finch. It was just a prank. 
 Well, that's endearing. 
 Unfortunately, the machine never issues a false alarm. 
 The robbery will happen. 
 And when it does, this crew's in big trouble. 
 How's our guy doing? 
 I'm making progress, softening him up a bit. 
 Doesn't matter. You've been reassigned. 
 You head out tonight. China. 
 No can do. 
 I need to take leave-- 
 Family emergency. 
 You don't have any family, Reese, and I've been assured that the situation is... urgent. 
 So find someone else. 
 There's no time to find someone else. 
 We've lost control of a certain item. 
 Securing it is the highest priority. 
 Do you understand? 
 We understand. 
 You lost something. You need us to get it back. 
 What are we looking for? 
 Are you familiar with Stuxnet? 
 Computer virus. 
 Built by us to disable the iranian nuclear program. 
 The package you're looking for is similar. 
 Only this one targets the Chinese. 
 That's correct. 
 We believe someone inside the Pentagon sold a secure laptop containing some of the source code to a Chinese firm. 
 They may be studying the code to inoculate their devices, or they may be modifying the code to target the US nuclear infrastructure. 
 Either way, we need the laptop returned. 
 Where are we going? 
 Ordos. 
 It's a company town in the middle of China. 
 It was built for a million people, only the company that built it folded. 
 It's a ghost town. No residents. 
 So you're gonna fly into Beijing. 
 Diplomatic cover, two weeks to gather intel, then you're going in. 
 The laptop has to be handled with extreme caution, so no phones. No network devices of any kind. 
 This software will exploit any open communication channel. 
 Understood? 
 Let's go. 
 Reese. 
 One more thing. 
 [Door closes] 
 After you secure the package, you're to retire Agent Stanton. 
 You're telling me to kill my partner? 
 We've intercepted unauthorized communications between her and this man, a go-between for Hezbollah. 
 Large deposits into an off-shore account. 
 She's been compromised. 
 As her partner, you should have noticed. 
 We clean up our own mess, Reese. 
 You know that. 
 You get this done, you can have all the leave you need. 
 You understand? 
 [Dials number] 
 [Phone ringing] 
 This is Jessica. You missed me. 
 Leave a message. 
 [Beep] 
 [Phone beeps] 
 What are we looking at? 
 I've hacked the truck company's servers and retrieved your route for today. 
 If I know the pickup locations, I can narrow down where the robber might hit. 
 Carter get back to you on the plate of the car following us? 
 Not yet. 
 [Cell phone rings] 
 [Phone beeps] 
 Lionel, you've been quiet. 
 I was getting worried. 
 Yeah, it's like the wild, wild west out here with Lynch. 
 HR's getting short on funds since we took down Elias, so he's chasing down street money with a baseball bat. 
 Not like I didn't have enough enemies on the street. 
 Keep gathering intel. 
 We need to know their leadership. 
 Take down the remaining players. 
 At least I'm getting a cut for my efforts. 
 What do you want me to do with the money? 
 I care about HR, Fusco, not the money. 
 What you do with it is your business. 
 Ah. 
 [Phone beeps] 
 [Car door opens] 
 Hey, dad. 
 Hey, buddy. 
 What do you say I take you after practice, get you some new gear? 
 Really? 
 Yeah, why not? 
 These pictures you sent over look suspiciously like the ones from  our  automated license plate readers. 
 Did you take one off my car? 
 Well, no... Not your car. 
 I'll pretend I didn't hear that. 
 Anyway, the plate belongs to a '95 gray Chevrolet van, registered to the 72-year-old transit authority administrator. 
 A 72-year-old that's casing an armored car? 
 That's why I dug a little deeper. 
 Apparently the owner's nephew, Frank Lowell, was paroled two months ago. 
 Busted back in '05 for armed robbery, along with buddy, Mick Norton, released last year. 
 I just sent the photos to you. 
 You might need help with these two. 
 I got it covered. 
 Hey, did you catch up on your beauty sleep, sunshine? 
 Not so much. 
 I had a nightmare I was working with a bunch of clowns. 
 [Laughs] 
 Yeah, well, that's Tommy. 
 He's always clowning around. 
 Is that Tommy's wife? 
 Talk about a ball buster. 
 I celebrate the anniversary of my divorce like it's new year's Eve. 
 This job is stressful enough. 
 No one needs that nonsense to come home to, no. 
 Marriage is a racket. 
 Back for more, John? 
 Oh, I see Murray here skipped his morning pilates again. 
 Yeah, I'm starting a new French toast regimen. 
 Who's your friend, Tommy? 
 Hey. 
 John the newbie, Ashley. 
 He needs to learn the ropes, and I'm the ropes master. 
 What are you having, hon? 
 Something you can put in the bag. 
 I always stick with a fried egg sandwich. 
 Yeah, but that's because you can't read the rest of the menu. 
 Coffee's fine, thank you. 
 Whoa, that's a nice bracelet, huh? 
 Who's the lucky stiff, Ashley? 
 It's nothing. It's just a present from my grandma. 
 She's got good taste. 
 I threw in a little extra hot sauce with your sandwich, Tommy. 
 Whoa, Tommy, you got a little extra hot sauce, huh? 
 Hey, married man over here. 
 Yeah, more like half a man. 
 All right, ladies, time to punch in. 
 Let's go. 
 So what's your story, John? 
 You ever been a security guard anywhere else? 
 Here and there. 
 Mall cop? 
 Supermarket stiff? 
 Something like that. 
 All I'm saying is, this ain't Walmart. 
 You ever been robbed before? 
 Once. 
 My partner and I were servicing this ATM. 
 These two guys came up with guns. 
 I tried to be a hero. Took two in the vest. 
 They got away. 
 I got a set of cracked ribs and a bump in hazard pay. 
 Don't worry. Most of the job is like this, you know? Sitting around in traffic, trying not to get carsick. 
 If the bullets don't get you, the boredom will. 
 I've just flagged the gray van's license plate, so the plate reader will alert us just as soon as it appears again. 
 I've also been able to retrieve some information from the company's database about your stops today. 
 One state bank. 
 Your cargo is their employees' tax returns. 
 [Horn honks] 
 Your next stop, Heliogem Incorporated. 
 But the shipment is just low-grade stones for industrial use. 
 Next stop is Regan Medical Supply, manufacturers of... pacemakers, among other things. 
 Those are expensive, hardly something you can fence on the street. 
 Heading your way, Murray. 
 Hang on. 
 The internal manifest shows that you're actually picking up raw materials for pacemakers. 
 Platinum. 
 Platinum is priced at $1,600 an ounce. 
 That approximately $25,000 a pound. 
 There's 50 pound-- 
 Mr. Reese, those cases are worth about $1.25 million. 
 That must be the target. 
 [Tires squealing] 
 [Laughs] Wow, bro. 
 You need to relax. 
 [Sighs] 
 Come on, Murray, let's go. 
 [Engine turning over] 
 I don't understand. 
 The robbery should have taken place at the last stop. 
 All you've got left is DeWitt Grocery. 
 That's inconsequential compared-- 
 [Tires squeal, shouting] 
 [Breathing heavily] 
 [Gunshots hitting the van] 
 Stay here. 
 [Gunshots] 
 [Gunshots] 
 Come on, let's go. 
 Mr. Reese? Mr. Reese? 
 Alpha team is on-site. 
 They've got their owners, and we've got ours. 
 I'll let you know when it's done. 
 This is where we part ways. 
 You're going in alone. 
 Intel says you can expect only light resistance. 
 I've got orders to confiscate any comm devices you have. 
 How do we signal for extract? 
 Use these. IR chem lights. 
 A helo's going to meet you at the LZ. 
 You've got 72 hours. 
 We got orders to make our own way back. 
 Bird flu must have been a cover. 
 The place is under quarantine. 
 Scaring the locals. 
 A lot of precautions for a computer virus. 
 I'm not sure we're being told the whole story here. 
 "Ours is not to reason why." 
 Isn't that what you taught me? 
 And I thought you weren't listening. 
 Looks like we're a little late to the party. 
 Mr. Reese. 
 [Machines beeping] 
 Mr. Reese? 
 You got that ID running? 
 Mr. Reese? 
 What's happening, doctor? 
 We're losing him. 
 [Indistinct] 
 Standing by. OR three. 
 BP 70/52. 
 I'm getting no pulse at all. 
 [Nurse speaking indistinctly] 
 All right, I'm calling. 
 
 
 
 [Phone rings] 
 [Indistinct chatter] 
 Looks like you could use some help. 
 Come on. Hold on to me. 
 Bruised ribs. 
 Bullet hit the vest, broke the skin. 
 You're lucky it's not worse. 
 I wasn't supposed to help Tommy. 
 I was supposed to stop him. 
 Yeah, well, most inside jobs, guy leaves a door open, takes a cut. 
 Guy comes out blasting like this, he better have a well- thought-out exit strategy. 
 This guy's got a family. 
 Yeah, we're searching his house right now, bringing his wife in for questioning. 
 He's got to be working with somebody. 
 Well, he needs a fence. 
 He's still got to flip that platinum. 
 Hmm. 
 [Phone rings] 
 Yeah? 
 He's right here with me. 
 Oh, thank God. 
 [Phone beeps] 
 I tracked your phone to a hospital, but... 
 I didn't know-- 
 It's okay, Harold. 
 I'm still ticking. 
 Well, I'm watching the feed that we piggybacked off the internal camera in the truck. 
 Tommy had a second phone. 
 Sent a text just before the robbery. 
 He must have been signaling the other robbers. 
 Well, we gotta track him, Finch. 
 I've got to stop Tommy before he hurts anyone else. 
 Oh! 
 [Laughs] 
 [Children chattering indistinctly] 
 Used to play pickup games here when I was a kid. 
 You were a kid? 
 Got into some fights. Learned how to use my fists. 
 I need you to do something. 
 What? 
 Pick up something in Brooklyn. 
 Details to follow. 
 Failure's not an option. 
 I know you understand what I'm saying. 
 Where's your husband, Mrs. Clay? 
 I don't know. 
 I haven't talked to Tommy all day. 
 Yeah, well, he's been busy. 
 He robbed his own truck, shot two people, and you still haven't heard from him. 
 Tommy is a good person. 
 He's never talked about stealing anything off a truck. 
 Is that right? 
 Found this in a closet in your house. 
 It's for a diamond tennis bracelet, part of a shipment Tommy delivered two days ago. 
 But I guess it just fell off the truck. 
 A diamond what? 
 Tommy didn't give you a bracelet, did he? 
 Tommy's having an affair, so if we find his girlfriend, we'll find him. 
 I'm way ahead of you, Detective. 
 Top off? 
 Absolutely. 
 Anything yet, Finch? 
 Yes, as a matter of fact. 
 One number in her call history comes up several times in the last hour. 
 No name on the account. 
 Could be Tommy on a burner phone. 
 Can you track him? 
 We'll see. 
 I'm texting him an alluring photo from Ashley's archive, hoping it'll get a quick response. 
 When he opens the message, a spyware trojan embedded in the file will send his GPS coordinates. 
 Good. 
 Mr. Reese, I got a hit on Tommy's burner phone. 
 He last checked it from the Royce motel. 
 [Suspenseful music] 
 ♪ ♪ 
 Tommy's not here. 
 It looks like the robbers that were with him are dead. 
 He's cutting his ties to the heist, keeping the loot for himself. 
 Bodies are still warm. 
 [Door opens] 
 Tommy's still here. 
 [Grunts] Hold it. 
 So much for the bird flu. 
 These people were gunned down. 
 Software engineers, not soldiers. 
 Why kill them? 
 [Gasping] 
 We got a live one here. Mostly alive. 
 [Groans] what did he say? 
 [Gunshot] 
 He said he wanted something for the pain. 
 Action here was clean. 
 Fast. 
 BMR recon team maybe or hired guns. 
 Looks like the package. 
 Why kill all these people and leave it behind? 
 Maybe they copied it. 
 Or altered it and left it for us to find. 
 Helo won't be able to pick us up till dark. 
 We need a safe place to wait for extract. 
 Safe from whom? 
 We're the only living people in this city. 
 After you. 
 I should've shot you and simplified my life. 
 Pressure getting to you, Lionel? 
 Why are you here? 
 Len sent me over. 
 Presupposed to meet a guy by the name of Clay. 
 HR looking for a cut of the heist? 
 HR helped set up the heist. 
 They hand-picked the shooters. 
 I'm supposed to be picking up their cut. 
 You've got a problem. Tommy Clay's long gone. 
 And he left his buddies behind. 
 Ah, jeez. 
 [Groans] 
 I don't come back with the platinum, hr's gonna think I took it. 
 That makes me a dead man. 
 You gotta help me with this. 
 You got me working with these guys in the first place. 
 I'll find Tommy. 
 Now off you go. 
 Off I go? 
 What am I gonna tell HR, huh? 
 You're a talented liar, Detective, remember? 
 That's why I picked you. 
 You there, Finch? 
 Always. 
 If you're calling to ask where Tommy is, I don't know. 
 He destroyed his phone as soon as he left the motel. 
 Get anything off the phone? 
 Only that he uses the name Ashley as a password on almost everything. 
 Ashley from the diner? 
 Must be love. 
 And it's mutual. 
 I checked her credit card transactions. 
 She just charged over $5,000 worth of Louis Vuitton suitcases. 
 She's running off with Tommy. 
 I'll try to intercept her, and you try to track down Tommy. 
 I'm not sure he deserves our protection, Mr. Reese. 
 He killed his friend in cold blood and shot me in the back. 
 I wasn't thinking of protecting him. 
 You're telling me this guy killed two of our men and took off with all the platinum? 
 Maybe it's beginner's luck. 
 Getting ambitious, Detective? 
 Working an angle? 
 Look, you don't believe me, go to the hotel. 
 There's two dead bodies and two empty cases. 
 Thing about angles, Fusco, you add 'em up, always comes out the same. 
 [Scoffs] 
 You know, the longer we stand here talking, the further distance this kid Tommy is gonna put between us and our money. 
 Assuming you're not shining me on, there's only so many places he could fence the platinum. 
 So where are they? We'll divvy them up. 
 No. We do it together. 
 That way I can keep an eye on you. 
 Such a long day. 
 Oh, I know. 
 Just want to go home. 
 Call me. 
 Talk to you later? Bye. 
 Hello, Ashley. 
 [Gasps] 
 Get out of my car. 
 No. 
 Sorry. 
 You work with Tommy. 
 What do you want? 
 You know, that is a nice bracelet. 
 Grandma didn't give it to you, did she? 
 But I know who did. 
 Where is he? Where's Tommy, Ashley? 
 I don't know. 
 Honestly, I don't. 
 What do you mean? 
 [Sighs] 
 I'm supposed to wait for him here. 
 He was gonna pick me up three hours ago, so either something terrible has happened to him or... 
 He's gone without me. 
 What was your plan? 
 I never should have believed him. 
 He said he was going to take me away from all this, and we were gonna go to Cabo together. 
 Well, at least you got your nice Louis Vuitton bags. 
 This Tommy's turned out to be a real operator, Finch. 
 And right now, he's putting everyone in his rearview mirror. 
 You got anything? 
 Tommy's a creature of habit. 
 Uses the same password for everything. 
 His other habit is buying Symetel burner phones. 
 Symetel leases their numbers in consecutive blocks. 
 I wrote a script trying the password "Ashley" on all new numbers, and I found his new phone. 
 Along with web-based voicemail message he received. Listen. 
 Got your message. 
 Arturo's Boxing Club. I'll be there in an hour. 
 My guess is this is the man Tommy's selling the platinum to. 
 Message was received 45 minutes ago. 
 On my way. Give Carter the address. 
 I'll wrap Tommy up, give him to her. 
 [Phone dialing] 
 [Phone rings] 
 What's up? 
 Got a location on the armored truck robber-- 
 Arturo's Boxing Club in Queens. 
 John's on his way there. 
 Carter. 
 Detective, did you hear me? 
 Hang up. The CIA's onto me. 
 You'll have to handle this on your own. 
 Agent Snow and... whatever your name is. 
 Evans. 
 What do you want? 
 Oh, to say hi, see how you are. 
 I'm fine. What do you want? 
 We know that you're talking to the FBI about Reese. 
 Is there a law against that? 
 As they've proven time and again, the FBI cannot be trusted with matters of national security. 
 Do not talk to Agent Donnelly. 
 Oh, you mean about our mutual friend. 
 Why, you're afraid Donnelly's gonna get to him first? 
 What exactly are you worried he's gonna tell him? 
 Be careful, Detective. 
 We're closing the net on John. 
 He's good at hiding, but I'm good at finding people. 
 And when I do, you're gonna want to be on the right side of this thing. 
 Don't talk to Donnelly. 
 [Sighs] 
 Mr. Reese, I'm afraid you're on your own now. 
 Carter just had a visit from your old colleagues in the CIA. 
 Copy that. 
 [Door opens, closes] 
 Who is it? 
 Hey, Tommy. 
 Johnny. 
 [Grunts] 
 [Groans] 
 That's for shooting me in the back. 
 [Grunting] 
 That's for Murray. 
 Where's the platinum? 
 [Laughs] I'm not telling you. 
 You won't get away with this. 
 You have no idea who you're dealing with. 
 You think? 
 I'm just as smart as every one of those jerks. 
 Tommy, you were clean. 
 You had a wife, a kid, no prior record. 
 But you threw it all away. Why? 
 Because every day for the last ten years, I've protected other people's money, and I have nothing show for it. Nothing. 
 So the world owes you, is that it? 
 No, it doesn't. 
 I figured that one out. Took a while. 
 You know what else I figured out? 
 Hauling around all that money-- 
 You get what you take. 
 So I'm taking mine. 
 That's not gonna happen. 
 The thing about striking out on your own, Tommy, is that's usually how you end up. 
 Oh, yeah? 
 I think you got that just about right. 
 [Gun clicks] 
 Hi, Tommy. 
 Hi, babes. 
 Help me get rid of this mope, will you? 
 Spent decades trying to invent the perfect nutritional ration. 
 And it's still inedible. 
 It's just a matter of time before this is all obsolete. 
 We'll still have to eat. 
 I'm not talking about the MREs. 
 You got satellites replacing surveillance teams, drones replacing fighter pilots. 
 So we've outlived our usefulness? 
 We'll be replaced by a push of a button, is that it? 
 What do you think? 
 I think we're still here. 
 You ever wonder where we get our intel? 
 I thought you didn't ask questions, just followed orders. 
 I never said it was easy. 
 Sun's setting. 
 Time to go. 
 [Phone ringing] Yeah? 
 Our friend is in a bit of trouble. 
 We need your help. 
 Who are you talking to? 
 Uh, I'm busy right now. I can't talk. 
 My ex. 
 Now you're going to tell me who's coming for us. 
 Where's the platinum, Tommy? 
 It's over there under the ring in that box with the gloves. 
 So Ashley's the brains, and you're the muscle. 
 Is that right, Tommy? 
 [Chuckles] 
 We're partners. 
 She convinced you it was time to make your move, didn't she? 
 She said you deserve more from life. 
 Ignore him, Tommy. 
 I'm so sorry. 
 Sorry? 
 What are you sorry for? 
 The law of the fishes. 
 I should've seen it coming. 
 What are you talking about? 
 The people I help, I never know if they're gonna be the victim or the perp, but I think, this time, you're both. 
 [Gunshot] 
 Now what? 
 You think you're going to walk out of here and live happily ever after? 
 You're dealing with some very bad people. 
 Shut up. 
 Right now, you have what they want, and they won't stop until they get it. 
 First time you shot someone? 
 First one's hard. 
 You've probably been thinking about it for a while, psyched yourself up. 
 But the second one can even be harder. 
 [Whimpers] 
 [Gunshot] 
 All there? 
 Yeah. 
 Heh, what do you know? 
 You weren't lying after all. 
 Well, look who's here... 
 Carter's guardian angel. 
 Thought our paths might cross again at some point. 
 I think it's your turn to hang off the side of a building. 
 Hey, forget him, let's get out of here. 
 You're right. 
 I was gonna have some fun. 
 [Chuckles] 
 But I'll just shoot him. 
 [Gunshot] 
 Mr. Reese, everything okay? 
 Finch, we're going to need your trunk. 
 No, I got this one. 
 I shot him with her gun. 
 Simple enough to make it look like Lynch botched the whole thing. 
 You're getting good at this, Lionel. 
 I was always good at this. 
 That's why you picked me in the first place. 
 Remember? 
 Time to wrap this up, John.

 Listen, Cara, there's something you need to know-- 
 [Gunshot] 
 Sorry, John. 
 Nothing personal. 
 They told me you've been compromised, that as your partner, it was my mess to clean up. 
 [Weak laugh] 
 Something funny? 
 I got the same orders as you. 
 Whoever sent us here doesn't want us to retrieve the package. 
 They want to confirm it's destroyed. 
 They want everyone who had contact with it destroyed. 
 And you just gave them a beacon. 
 [Plane flies overhead] 
 Target locked. 
 You are clear to engage. 
 Engaging.

 Hey, we got a lead on Reese. 
 An asset in North Korea, a dissident group helped an injured CIA operative escape from a town near Ordos, China, may 2010. 
 Ordos? Must be our guy. 
 The asset pointed us to a bank account out of Grand Cayman. 
 Same account was accessed two days ago at a bank across the street from the Royal Manhattan hotel. 
 Meet me there.
