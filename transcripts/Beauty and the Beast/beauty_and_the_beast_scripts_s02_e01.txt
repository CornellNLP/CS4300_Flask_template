 Beauty & the Beast... 
 Vincent :  Catherine, in all those years  that I was watching over you, all I ever wanted  was to meet you. 
 Vincent, you're not a monster. 
 You saved my life. 
 (car speeding) 
 (thump, crowd gasps) 
 Dad! 
 Catherine's blood contained no common identifiers with your father. 
 I'm not quite following. 
 There was no match between Catherine and your father. 
 (monitor beeping steadily) 
 Vincent :  I was part of a highly classified unit of super soldiers. 
 These people from Muirfield, they will not stop until  they've buried their mess. 
 Catherine :  Vincent, Muirfield is out there hunting you. 
 (growling) 
 (roars) 
 Vincent! 
 Don't shoot! 
 She's my daughter.

 Forbes. 
 Catherine : JT? 
 Oh. Hey, Cat. 
 How's it going, at 5:00 a.m.? 
 Just checking in to see if you have any leads on Vincent. 
 You mean since you asked me eight hours ago? 
 It wasn't eight hours, it was... nine. 
 Cat, this has been going on for almost three months. 
 Maybe you ought to-- 
 I don't know-- take a little break maybe. 
 Anyway, anything? 
 (sighs) 
 Okay, well, I'm still hacked in to the city's surveillance cameras, scanning social media sites, cross-checking his photo with facial recognition, but so far, nada. 
 Vincent is out there somewhere; I know it, I feel it. 
 Muirfield could've easily just killed him, but they didn't. 
 They captured him, which means that they need him for something. 
 Which means we're the only ones who can save him from all the awful things that they've done to him. 
 Come on, Cat, don't you think I know that? 
 I care about him, too! 
 I mean, I've been trying to save Vincent for, what, ten years? 
 I owe him. 
 But I love him. 
 And I don't care if it makes sense to you or to anybody else, I am not gonna stop until I find him. 
 (sighs) And I don't care if it makes sense to you I'm sorry. 
 No, it's okay, I understand. 
 It's just... 
 I'll be honest, I'm not just worried about him, I'm worried about you, too. 
 I mean, you've got Vincent, all the craziness at the precinct, your dad passing away. 
 It's been what, like, a month since the funeral? 
 Okay, don't worry about me. 
 Okay? 
 Just... don't stop looking for Vincent. 
 Please. 
 I don't know if you've noticed, which you probably haven't 'cause you've been mostly AWOL around here lately-- not that I'm complaining... 
 I'm sorry. 
 The point is, the workload's doubled ever since the D.A. overturned Joe's cases. 
 And although I'm used to covering for you-- again, not like I mind... 
 No, you should. 
 It's just... 
 Look, I know how much you love the guy, but I think I have the right to know how much longer this is gonna go on. 
 Until I find him, Tess, okay? 
 Right, but what if you can't? 
 Look, I'm sorry. 
 I'm your friend, I'm allowed to blunt. 
 It's one of the perks. 
 Look, I don't want to be the bad guy here, I don't, but you know as well as I do that the odds of finding a missing person after... 
 You sound like JT. 
 You guys ganging up on me? 
 I'm not giving up until I find him, Tess. 
 That's funny. 
 That's exactly what Joe said about finding his brother's killer: "I'm not giving up." 
 It was all he cared about, but it kept him from focusing on all the other cases, and that's what's caused this mess and cost him his job. 
 And me my boyfriend. 
 Just make sure you know what it's costing you, Cat, okay? 
 Make sure it's worth it. 
 I know what it's costing me, Tess, believe me. 
 Sometimes when I'm alone, and it's late and it's quiet, I just... I just want to cry. 
 For Vincent, for my Dad. 
 But I can't. 
 I won't let myself, not until I find Vincent. 
 I have to stay strong. 
 It's a dangerous game, putting yourself on hold like that. 
 It's gonna catch up with you sooner or later. 
 I know. 
 Gabe : Catherine! 
 Speaking of beasts. 
 Catherine, I need to talk to you. 
 In private. 
 Catherine :  This better be good. 
 Because I don't care if the D.A. put you in charge, I don't have to listen to you. 
 I know, but... 
 Maybe I haven't been around much lately, but you know what I'm doing, and I don't expect any flak, because if I hadn't saved your life, you wouldn't even be here. 
 And you know how grateful I am. 
 And, honestly, when you couldn't help me find Vincent, which was the only reason I saved your sorry ass in the first place, I should've just left well enough alone when your beast side died, you know what I mean? 
 No offense. 
 None taken. 
 And, for the record... 
 Catherine, JT found Vincent. 
 He couldn't get in touch with you, so he sent it to me. 
 He sent what to you? 
 ♪ Beauty and the Beast 2x01 ♪ 
 Who Am I? 
 Original Air Date on October 7, 2012 
 Are you sure it's Vincent? 
 Facial recognition's still working on it. 
 Wait, what? 
 You said it was him when you called. 
 No, I said it might be him. 
 Well, if you weren't sure, then why did you send it over? 
 I'm sorry, do we even like you? 
 Come on, come on. 
 Gabe : Well, you should test the whole shot. 
 Right. 
 (computer beeping) 
 How long ago did you find this? 
 Just before I sent it to you guys. 
 What? What kind of software are you using? 
 JT : There's nothing wrong with my software. 
 Gabe : Then why isn't it finding a match? 
 I don't know. 
 Maybe 'cause it's not him. 
 Let me try something. 
 Don't touch my stuff. 
 There a reason why you want it to be Vincent so badly? 
 I'm just saying, last time, it was 'cause you wanted to kill him so you could save yourself. 
 What do I have to do to prove I'm not a beast anymore? 
 Maybe donate your body to science? 
 Catherine? What are you doing? 
 Where are you going? 
 Going to save Vincent, or whoever that is. 
 (car horns honking) 
 (siren whoops) 
 (horn honks) 
 Come on, come on! 
 Out of the way! 
 (phone beeps) 
 Tess, I'm heading to Brooklyn Shipyards, pier 48. 
 I might need some backup. 
 What's your... 
 (horn honks) 
 Moron! 
 ...ETA? 
 Heather : Cat, is that you? 
 Heather? 
 You know, I'd like to think that you're actually returning my phone call finally, Heather, I am... I am so sorry. 
 Um, just out of curiosity, when was the last time you were home? 
 I-I really don't have time to explain right now. 
 Can I call you back? 
 Cat, that's the problem. 
 You never have time anymore. 
 Ever since the funeral, you've been, like, impossible to get ahold of, and I'm worried about you. 
 Are you, like, undercover or something? 
 Or something. 
 (horn honks) 
 Do you not see the flashing light?! 
 (siren whoops) 
 Cat, listen, I need to make sure that you're coming tonight, because I cannot do this speech without you. 
 What speech? 
 At the tribute Dad's law firm is throwing him. 
 They're making him a name partner, remember? 
 Wait, that's-that's tonight? 
 Cat, you promised that you would be there. 
 I know that you're busy and all, but this is for Dad. 
 This matters. 
 Don't worry, I'll be there, okay? 
 Good. Um... 
 And then maybe we can talk afterwards. 
 We-we really need to talk. 
 It's about dad. 
 (tires screech) 
 You know, you should be flattered. 
 I wouldn't risk coming out in the open for just anybody. 
 But seeing as how many years I've been looking for you... I just wanted to make sure it really was you. 
 Look at me. 
 Look at me. 
 ♪ 
 (gulls screeching) 
 (metallic clinking) 
 (grunting) 
 You do know who I am, right? 
 Yeah. You're somebody I want to kill. 
 Why? 
 Just because I'm the one who turned you into a beast? 
 Pretty good reason, don't you think? 
 I suppose if I was in your shoes, I'd think the same. 
 But in fairness, back when I first took over Muirfield from my dad, I was just a kid, a genetic scientist looking for a job. 
 Government knocked on my door, wallet in hand, asked me if I could build them a super soldier. 
 And here I am. 
 And here you are. 
 An experiment gone awry, but nonetheless, a potentially profitable one on the open market. 
 You're a valuable weapon, Mr. Keller, at least... now that I've captured you. 
 What makes you think I didn't just capture  you? 
 Because... you're the one in the cuffs. 
 (clanking) 
 Alloy steal and titanium. 
 You forget, I know exactly what you're capable of. 
 After all, I made you. 
 Now it's time to make you even more valuable. 
 (roaring) 
 Stop him! 
 (Vincent chuffs, man grunting) 
 (rapid gunfire) 
 (grunts) 
 (whoosh) 
 Go. 
 Where is he?! 
 Do you see him?! 
 (whoosh) 
 (footsteps approaching) 
 (roaring) 
 (roaring) 
 Vincent? 
 (roars) 
 Thank God I found you! 
 (car engine starts, revs) 
 (tires squealing) 
 (chuffs) 
 (breath quivering loudly) 
 (low growling) 
 Vincent... 
 (low growl) 
 Vincent. 
 (growling) 
 (gasps) 
 What, you followed me here? 
 You got more darts in that thing? 
 Yeah. 
 But one's all we needed last... time. 
 (Vincent chuffing) 
 There he is! 
 Shoot him! 
 (guttural gasp) 
 (chuffing) 
 That's impossible. 
 (sighs heavily) 
 (whoosh) 
 Watch out! 
 (low growling) 
 It's okay. 
 It's okay. 
 It's over. 
 Hey, you're going to be okay. 
 (low growl) 
 His scar's gone. 
 All that matters is that you're back, safe. 
 I never stopped looking for you. 
 Who are you? 
 (gasps) 
 (distorted whooshing) 
 At least let me stay until he wakes up, just to be safe. 
 I don't need you to protect me from Vincent. 
 Catherine, I know I haven't earned your trust back yet, but the only way I can truly make my amends is to keep trying, and that starts with helping him and protecting you. 
 We don't need your help. 
 What? 
 Look, I don't like the guy any more than you do, but aren't you a little concerned about what Muirfield did to Vincent? 
 I mean, let's face it. 
 He clearly different. 
 And, frankly, a little scary. 
 Scary, JT, really? 
 What are you, like, six? 
 Come on, it took three tranq darts to stop him. Three. 
 He didn't even recognize you, Cat. 
 (Vincent sighs) 
 Okay, where am I? 
 It's okay, it's okay. Just-just... take it eas... take it easy. (groans) 
 Okay, you're home. 
 Home? 
 (panting) 
 Okay, just relax. 
 Vincent, look at me. 
 Do you remember me? 
 I'm... I'm Cat. 
 Catherine. 
 Catherine. 
 Yeah. 
 No. Sorry. 
 Okay. Uh, do you know who he is? 
 Your husband? 
 Okay, look, you seem like nice people, honestly, you really do, and you are smoking hot, but, unfortunately, I think you're confusing me with somebody else, so I will just be... 
 (groans) 
 It's all right. 
 (sighs) 
 It's all gonna come back to you. Just... 
 Do you remember anything from the last three months? 
 Being captured? 
 What happened to you? 
 I got to go. 
 Go? Go where? 
 Recognize him, big guy? 
 That's us, taken 11 years ago. 
 Which means, you and I-- we've known each other a long time. 
 (phone buzzes) 
 (sighs) 
 I completely lost track of time. 
 I promised my sister I'd be there for my dad's tribute. 
 It's okay. I got this. 
 I'm serious. 
 That's important. Go. 
 I can't just leave Vincent, not after we finally found him. 
 You're not leaving him. 
 I got him. 
 All right. 
 But whatever you do, don't let him leave, promise. 
 Don't worry. 
 He's not going anywhere. 
 Okay. 
 (indistinct chatter) 
 I am telling you, somebody set me up. 
 Made me think I'd finally found Keller so he could flush me out into the open and kill me, and I want to know who! 
 Well, first of all, Zhao, you don't tell me what to do. 
 I don't work for you, you work for me. 
 You don't understand. 
 Somebody's out to get me, Reynolds. 
 And whoever it is stole my formula and turned Keller into the beast that I was gonna turn him into! 
 Look, maybe it's time we shut Muirfield down. 
 Shut Muirfield down? 
 I  am  Muirfield. 
 Okay, listen to me. 
 Now, I've warned you before. 
 As soon as your experiments start getting out of control, we... 
 My experiments have made us both a lot of money, so don't threaten me. 
 And just so we're clear, if I go down, you go down, too. 
 The FBI came to me 15 years ago, okay, not the other way around. 
 These may be my creations, but you're the ones who wanted it black ops, so you try to shut me down, and I start talking to the press, understand? 
 Keller's worth a lot of money to me, and I want him back. 
 (click, phone beeps off) 
 What happened? 
 I don't know yet, but Zhao is still alive. 
 Does he know we set him up? 
 Not yet. 
 We got to get Vincent to go after him again. Otherwise, Zhao is gonna slither away for good. Has Vincent checked in? 
 No, he's not at the boat, either. 
 I don't even know where to start looking for him. 
 I think I do. 
 Zhao said a cop got in the way this morning. 
 A female cop. 
 Would you like to try this? 
 Hey! There you are! 
 Hey. I am so sorry I'm late. 
 Oh, it's okay, I'm just glad that you're here. 
 Look at you. 
 You look so beautiful! 
 No, I just, uh, wanted to dress up for Dad. 
 So, uh, what is it you've been trying to tell me so badly? 
 Um, not here, Cat. Not now. 
 It's too important, but we'll talk after? 
 I'm sorry. 
 Yeah. No. 
 Could I borrow you for a sec? 
 Yeah, yeah. Oh. 
 And don't forget, you promised to speak for us tonight. 
 Yes. 
 Okay. 
 Yeah. 
 
 
 
 (distant siren wailing) 
 (horns honking) 
 Ms. Chandler? 
 I'm Bob Reynolds. 
 I just wanted to introduce myself, and let you know how sorry I am for your loss. 
 Your father was a very good man. 
 Thank you. Uh, how'd you know him? 
 Mm, crossed paths on a couple of cases over the years. 
 I'm an FBI Agent. 
 Really? 
 Wow. Uh, Dad never mentioned he worked with the FBI. 
 Yeah, he probably didn't want to bore you. 
 Yeah. 
 He said you're a detective, is that right? 
 Yeah, I'm over at the 125th. 
 Oh. You homicide? Vice? 
 No, I actually used to be special crimes, but, um, right now, I'm just helping out with a missing persons case. 
 Ah, missing persons. 
 They're sometimes the most frustrating. 
 And heartbreaking. 
 Tell me about it. 
 Um... it was nice to meet you. 
 You, too. 
 By the way... 
 You should know that your dad talked about you all the time. 
 He was super proud of you. 
 Worried, but proud. 
 Worried how? 
 I don't know. 
 He never would say. 
 I always just assumed he didn't like your boyfriend or something. 
 (chuckles) Fathers never think anybody's good enough for their daughters. 
 How true. 
 Yeah. 
 I think I know where Vincent is. 
 So, do we, uh, entertain a lot? 
 No, no. We just have a very big bar. 
 And the vault. 
 What are these, safe deposit boxes? 
 What do we use these for? 
 Uh, well, actually... 
 Are you sure you don't remember any of this? 
 If I did, would I be asking? 
 No, uh, sorry, never mind. 
 Uh, the truth is, this... you know, used to be a gentlemen's club a long time ago and it was just sitting around empty, so we... moved in. 
 Just the two of us? 
 Yep, just you and me. 
 But a-as friends. 
 Good friends, best friends but friends. 
 Only. Just. 
 This isn't helping, is it? 
 What about the girl? 
 The girl? You mean... Cat? 
 Yeah, she made it sound like were... close or something. 
 I mean, were we? 
 No, you  are  close. 
 Seriously, it's like... borderline epic. 
 What do you remember? 
 About anything. 
 I mean, y-you seemed to... know what you were doing at the warehouse this morning. 
 Which means, by definition, you must've stored and processed something in your memory banks. 
 Look, you seem like a nice guy. 
 But, honestly, if you keep asking me questions, I'm gonna have to break your neck, so, you know... 
 I wouldn't. 
 (phone buzzes) 
 Hello? 
 I'm sorry, who? 
 Condor? No, uh, you got the wrong number. 
 I got to go. 
 What? No, y-you can't go. 
 Sorry, I'm late. 
 Late? 
 Late for what? No. 
 Vincent, you have to stay. 
 I promised Cat. 
 Tell her you couldn't stop me. 
 (slide racks) 
 Please don't make me shoot you again. 
 (heart beating rapidly) 
 (ragged breathing) 
 (chuckles) 
 What? What-what is it? 
 Why are you smiling? 
 On his own dime and time, Thomas did more pro bono work (phone ringing) than any lawyer I know and, for that and more, we honor his name on our letterhead tonight and from now on. 
 (phone continues ringing) 
 JT, is everything all right? 
 No, actually. 
 Vincent's gone. 
 What? How could you let this happen? 
 I didn't really... have a choice. 
 And now... 
 Did he say where he was going? 
 (grunts) 
 ...daughter, Catherine, to say a few words on behalf of his family. 
 Cat? 
 JT, talk to me, damn it. 
 Sorry. 
 Can't. 
 JT? JT? 
 JT? 
 I am so sorry. 
 I still can't believe Vincent tranq'd you. 
 He would never do that to you. Here. 
 Well, maybe not the old Vincent. 
 He's gone, Cat. 
 I know he's gone, JT. 
 No, I mean he's gone mentally. 
 Far as I can tell, he can't remember anything about you, me, college, his childhood, nothing. 
 It's as if his memory's been wiped clean. 
 I'm not sure he's ever gonna remember us. 
 I don't believe that. 
 What are you doing? 
 You said Vincent said he was late for something. 
 Maybe it has to do with that guy that got away. 
 (beeping) 
 There. Forward that to Gabe. 
 Have him run an I.D. check through every database he can access. 
 Maybe if we can find who Vincent was after, we can find Vincent. 
 Keep me posted. 
 Wait, where are you going? 
 Do a little surveillance. 
 (beeping) 
 (computer trilling, tapping keyboard) 
 Damn it. 
 Hey, so we don't screw up any more cases, can you take a look at this? 
 Don't you ever knock? 
 Sorry, old habit. 
 I keep forgetting Joe's gone and you're in charge now. For some reason, my brain just, like, can't process that. Go figure. 
 You recognize this guy? 
 No, never seen him before. 
 That's the problem. 
 He doesn't exist anywhere on any database. 
 How does someone stay off the grid in this day and age? 
 I don't know. Friends in high places, maybe? 
 Is this a case we're working on? 
 No, it's a case Catherine's working on. 
 And she asked you to help? 
 What, did she lose her mind? 
 No, she lost Vincent. 
 And the last time she saw him, he was after whoever this guy is, which is what I'm trying to figure out. 
 Whatever. Let me know if I have enough for an arrest, okay? 
 I'm going home. 
 So that's it? 
 You don't care? 
 About Cat? Always. 
 About Vincent, um... 
 I don't know. 
 I mean, personally, I like him-- at least I used to-- but I'm just really tired of watching him ruin her life. 
 Enough already. 
 Do you care that we might be able to save him, like Catherine saved me? 
 I'm sorry, when you say "we," do you mean we humans or we beasts? 
 And by "we," I mean you. 
 Tess, I am not a beast anymore. 
 If I was, don't you think Muirfield would still be after me, too? 
 I don't know, okay? All that crap just gives me a headache anyway, and I wish I never even knew about it. 
 But you do, which means you were meant to know about it, which means you were meant to help. 
 Whether you're tired of it or not. 
 (beeping) 
 What is it? 
 It's a match. 
 Popped up on the SEC database of all places. 
 Whoever was covering his tracks must have forgot to look there. 
 Li Zhao? 
 Li Zhao, who's that? 
 He's the geneticist I tried to find when I first started looking for a cure, until I realized he's the one who created Muirfield. 
 Vincent's going after the man who turned him into a beast. 
 Condor. 
 Man (distorted) : What happened? 
 Sir, I don't know. 
 I let Zhao think that he had caught me. 
 And I had him, but... 
 Sir, who is Catherine Chandler? 
 Nobody you need to worry about. 
 Yeah, but she seemed to know me and... I believed her. 
 So? You're trying to tell me you're surprised that you had a life before this? 
 Did that never occur to you? 
 Of course not, sir, but when... 
 Then forget about it. 
 You can't let it distract you, do you understand? 
 You've got a job to do, soldier. 
 This is why you were chosen, what you were trained for. 
 That is all you need to remember. 
 Now get back on Zhao's trail before he disappears again and eliminate him this time, understood? 
 Understood, sir. 
 Zhao :  Stop him! 
 (heart beating rapidly) 
 (engine starts, tires screech) 
 (engine roars, tires screech) 
 Gamble paid off. 
 He came back. 
 Nothing wrong with his short-term memory. 
 What's he doing? 
 He's on the move. 
 If Gabe's right, he's following Zhao, although I have no idea how. 
 I wouldn't try to stop him if I were you. 
 I'm not. 
 If he's after Muirfield, I want to be there when he finds him. 
 We talking revenge? 
 No, justice. 
 I'll call you back. 
 (indistinct chatter) 
 Catherine : Okay, JT, I give up. 
 I have no idea how Vincent is tracking Zhao. 
 I might know. 
 According to the blood sample from the tranq dart, it looks like it might be all part of the new Vincent. 
 I'm listening. 
 There's been a small but significant change in his DNA. 
 Simply put, Vincent can now slow down and redirect the hemoglobin in his blood to heighten specific senses. 
 Okay, I'm not following. 
 Look, when you and I walk down a street, our senses can only tell us what's happening at that moment, right? But an apex predator... 
 (horn honking) 
 ...he can use his senses to track down  another animal that passed by that same spot... 
 ...hours or even days before. 
 Catherine : JT, there are eight million people in this city-- 
 How could Vince possibly track... 
 Do you know that grizzlies have been known to track their prey over 20 miles across the wild? 
 Yeah, a grizzly, maybe, but not a... 
 A beast? 
 (horn honks, tires screech) 
 Catherine : Whoa!

 Who are you working for?

 What? 
 This is how we met. 
 You saving me. 
 Whether you remember it or not, we're meant to be. 
 Our preliminary investigation indicates that the explosion was not related to any form of terrorism. 
 That said, however, the investigation is ongoing. 
 (reporters shouting questions) 
 Bad news. 
 None of the bodies at the scene matched Zhao's DNA. 
 Got away again. 
 (whispers): Damn it. 
 At least Muirfield's destroyed. 
 Yeah, but with Zhao still on the loose, it won't be long before he finds a way to start another Muirfield, and we're right back where we started. 
 So what do we do? 
 Bank on Vincent to follow orders. 
 Hope my daughter doesn't get in the way again. 
 (sighs) 
 (siren wailing in distance) 
 (siren wailing in distance) 
 Here, sit down. 
 No, I'm fine, really. 
 Sit. 
 Too bad you can't heal yourself anymore. 
 That's different, too. 
 Look, I just want to say I'm sorry. 
 For what? 
 For not remembering any of this, not... not remembering you. 
 It's okay, you will. 
 Bright side, in the meantime, we get to fall in love with each other all over again. 
 (laughs softly) What makes you so sure we will? 
 'Cause we don't have a choice. 
 I told you, we're meant to be. 
 You really believe that, don't you? 
 I do. 
 And I know you do, too. 
 You just... don't remember it yet. 
 But you do believe me, don't you? 
 About us? 
 Yes. 
 But... I... 
 But what? 
 Vincent, what aren't you telling me? 
 You can trust me; we can trust each other. 
 We always have. 
 Did Zhao do this to you? 
 Was this just about revenge... 
 Let it go. 
 No. 
 Please, don't. 
 I just... 
 I just want to help you. 
 I... hate that they did this to you. 
 I... I hate that they keep hurting you and I don't understand why. 
 Why can't they... why can't they just leave you alone? 
 I don't know. 
 But I can't answer any more questions-- do you understand? 
 Yes. 
 Yes, all right. 
 I'm sorry. 
 It's just... 
 It's been a long three months. 
 All that matters is that you're back, and that Muirfield's gone, and they can't... hurt anyone else like they hurt us. 
 Zhao got away. 
 I know. 
 I know, and we will find him, I promise. 
 But not tonight. 
 Tonight... 
 (whispers): please don't go.

 Hello? 
 Cat, it's Tess. 
 Where's Vincent? 
 Tess. What? 
 Vincent. 
 Do you know where he is? 
 I think you better get down here. 
 (siren wailing) 
 What happened? 
 I got to tell you, Cat, this is gonna be pretty hard to keep under wraps. 
 Why? Who's the victim? 
 Li Zhao. 
 It gets worse. 
 He wasn't just killed, he was mauled to death, as if by a wild animal. 
 (flashbulbs popping) 
 Where's Vincent? 
 (siren wailing)
