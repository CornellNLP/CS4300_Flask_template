 Catherine :  Nine years ago I witnessed my mother's murder. 
 I would've been killed, too, if it hadn't been for Vincent. Vincent :  I was part of an experimental Special Forces group. Their goal was to create the perfect super soldier. But something went wrong. You're him. Being in any relationship, it's a risk. Dr. Forbes, it's about something that you wrote. That was years ago. I have evidence that a cross-species creature exists. I could do with a biochemist. I'd include you in all aspects of the investigation. Catherine :  My nurse, you might know her? We grew up together. We were pretty close. They said you were dead. You should've just given up on me. Alex :  I loved you. Catherine : Maybe I've been misreading us. (panting) (knock on door) Hi. Hey. Remind me never to get shot again. Never get shot again. Come in. Thanks. Now put the dumbbell down. Why do I get the feeling that this is going to hurt even worse? Give me your hands. Come on. You need to work on your flexibility. (laughing): I don't remember asking you to be my personal physical therapist. Okay. Okay. Slightly back, that's it. Okay. Careful. You know, the first time I got shot in Afghanistan, I couldn't sleep for months. Yeah, it's like I'm sleepwalking. I can't do anything, and they've got me on restrictive duty until I am physically and emotionally up to par. (phone ringing) And, again. You want to answer that? Uh, no, it's okay. I'll call her back. Ah, it's Alex. Really, Vincent, it's okay. I don't mind. Uh, okay, thanks. Oh... Look, uh... Catherine, the thing is... You... you don't have to explain. She was your fiancée. You were planning a life together for years. Six years and an entire childhood. But... you and me... You and I are... You know, I don't know what were are. We're kind of in no-man's-land. Yeah, I mean-I mean, we've hardly even known each other, what, a few months. You know, it's really none of my business. Alex : I'll be right out. Yeah. You know, it's, uh, it's good you called. There's, um, there's something that I wanted to talk to you about, too. Alex : I'll be all yours if you just give me a sec. Is this what you wanted to show me? No. This is. (frame clatters) How am I supposed to compete with six years? Not to mention the fact that they grew up together and that she doesn't know all the darker sides of him. But, if I say, hey, pick me, and ignore that totally perfect, caring woman that you planned on spending your life with, I am a total bitch. Aren't I? Are you? Don't "are you?" me. It's bad enough that I am being forced to come here just to get back to full duty. I could do without the self-reflective crap. First of all, let me say that I am impressed by your willingness to open up so quickly... Yes, I know the mandatory routine. The sooner I spill my heart, the faster I get out of here. Second, what's mandatory, is for us to discuss the trauma that you went through during the shooting, not your boyfriend issues. Oh. Third, yes, you would be. And that's okay. Sometimes in life we need to be a bitch in order to get what we need. And you're off to a good start. Sorry. I had enough therapy to last a lifetime when my mom was killed. I know, that is like throwing prime rib at a Rottweiler. Interesting choice of dog. They're beautiful. And dangerous. No offense, Doctor... Oh, David. But I don't need a shrink to figure out what my problems are. You mean running away from tough emotions and throwing yourself into your work? I read your file. I hope it was a good read. Mm-hmm. And from your file, my conjecture is you lean on your crutches: work, protecting people... Yes, I took an oath. To serve and protect. But who are you really protecting? (man speaks indistinctly over P.A.) (keypad beeping) (zipper closing) Catherine? Alex. Hey, hi. What are you doing here? I was just jumping through hoops. Had to get a final evaluation before they return me to full duty. What are you doing? I'm just heading home. Running late. For... the gym? Oh, no, it's, uh, change of clothes. I live a very glamorous life. (elevator bell dings) Well, that's my ride. See you. Bye. JT :  Someone please explain to me  how a guy who's unemployed, never goes out, and is officially dead, gets not one, but two smoking hot women fighting for his attention. No, JT, the whole point of going over there was to tell her that I can't see her anymore. Because... because of Catherine. Kind of, yeah. I mean, Catherine's life has never been the same since she found out about me. And my secret. Neither has yours. You and Catherine, you risk so much to keep me safe. And you don't want Alex to take the same risks. No. Okay, but what if I don't tell her? Vincent. Look, I know what you're going to say, okay, but, JT, to have someone look at you and not feel like you've got this big secret that they have to protect, you know. Like Catherine does. Yeah. But, JT, I... I loved Alex. You know, we spent our whole childhoods planning everything, and then... ah. I don't know, I guess I got afraid. And you don't think Catherine's just backing off because she's trying to do the right thing? How did I end up on Catherine's side of this? My side of what? All you, my friend. (sighs) What's this? I don't know how to tell you this, but I ran into Alex at the hospital. She was putting a bunch of boxes into her duffel bag, and, it turns out that there are a bunch of thefts being reported at that ward. You've been spying on her? I followed up on something I saw. Vincent, she's stealing medicine and supplies from the hospital. You don't actually know that. Okay. You can believe me, or not, but there is an open narcotics investigation into these thefts, and someone else is going to find out, eventually. Does she know? I mean, does she know how careful she has to be with your secret? No. ♪ Beauty and the Beast 1x11 ♪ On Thin Ice 
Original Air Date on January 31, 2013 Ah, reading about skydiving is surprisingly very boring. Hope what you're doing is a lot more interesting. Oh, yeah, I have sharpened every pencil in the precinct. Thank you. So, how's the case going? Mm, sorry, partner, you're out on this one. Okay, if you don't tell me about this case, I am going to make you get mani-pedis with Heather. Have you ever heard of Noah Hawkes? No. He's one of Forbes' wealthiest men under 35. He went skydiving with his wife. Her chute didn't open, neither did the backup. Evan : That's because the parachute was definitely tampered with. Hey, Cat. Hey. I didn't hear anything. Based on the latent bacteria on the rip cord, it was cut 16 to 20 hours before the jump. All right, I'll look into Noah Hawkes' alibi. You may want to check if he's left-handed. From the angle of the cut, I'm 99% sure that the doer was a lefty. But I did hear that. That's my cue. Okay, Tess, you need to let me work on this case, or I am going to get myself in trouble. Sorry, Chandler, Joe laid down the law. You're to know nothing, nada, zero. Zip. I'm mortified. If I'd known it was "towel-only" option... Oh, God, oh, God. It just... it started to feel like old times and I got carried away. You know, when that towel dropped, I almost got carried away, too, so... Look, Alex, I'm sorry... No, I know. This is all so strange. I mean, you knew me better than anyone. Before or since. I used to think I knew you better than anyone. You did know me. But I am a completely different person now. Who isn't? Vince, I admit, with you back, it's all so confusing. I'm beginning to remember my old self, and I want that life back so badly. I guess the question is, do you? Want to go back in time to the way we used to be? Yeah, yeah, I do. But... a lot has changed. And I guess we both have a few new secrets, yeah? She saw me, didn't she? (quiet laugh) You could never lie to me, Vince. Your handler, Catherine, she caught me taking stuff from the hospital. I told her that you... weren't into anything like that. Actually I am. Kind of. You know how you said you wanted your old life back? Or parts of it anyway. I have something to show you. And no, it's not my linen collection this time. (bell jingles) (distant siren wailing) Hi. Hello. Okay, I never pegged you as a drug lord, but this... I have my doubts. It'll all make sense in a moment. (coughing nearby) What is this place? Like a care unit? It's for people who can't pay or can't get to another facility. There's still a lot of people our there without jobs, without any insurance. They fall through the cracks. Okay, Mrs. Voluska? You can take a seat in there. I'll be right with you. Um, Nurse Alex? Who's he? Um, just a... Just a friend. Doctor. Tess :  Mr. Hawkes,  did anyone besides you and your wife have access to her parachute? Am I being interrogated? No, sir, I'm just trying to assess the facts. The facts are that Lisa and I pack our own chutes. And the morning of the jump, nothing was out of place? No one touches them but us. I know this is difficult, I only have a few more questions to ask you. You're with Noah Hawkes, right? I bet you're a one sugar? Black. Ah. I'm on the Neanderthal diet. What is the Neanderthal diet? Nothing a caveman wouldn't eat. I'm ready to kill somebody for a carb. (laughs) Catherine Chandler. Pam Davis, CFO of Hawkes Worldwide. Ah. So how is Noah taking it? He's a wreck. Plus we're in the middle of an IPO and we spent the entire day before Lisa's death, uh, in marathon meetings. Wow, sounds stressful. Yeah. Tears me up to see Noah like this. Did he have a happy marriage? Storybook. Outside of work, they did everything together. Lisa and I, we loved living on the edge. And we knew with that risk comes a cost. I just never dreamed the price would be so high. Pam :  When somebody becomes  that integral to your life and suddenly they're gone, it makes you wonder who you are without them. Yeah, I have some personal experience in that department. Thanks for the coffee. Yeah. And if we need to talk with you further? I work the rest of the afternoon, then tonight there's this event I have to be at. That I obviously don't want to be at. But that you can't miss. Exclusive billionaire boys' club kind of deal at the Dylan Club. You are more than welcome to stop by if you need to pull me aside for a few minutes. Call me whenever-- I'll track him down. We should go to the Dylan Club. What, and party with a suspect? No, we'll go under the guise of working on the case. When in reality we're going...? About the case. And because you and I are both attractive women who shouldn't be wasting our youth on available men. So what, you want to get dressed up, put on smoky eyes and fall in love? Is that it? That's it exactly. And, look, if we happen to catch a break in the case, it's two birds with one stone. Preferably a diamond. The big question is what to wear. (phone ringing) JT : Leave a message and if I don't get back to you it's probably because I don't really like you. JT, it's Evan Marks. I think I found another victim of our cross-species animal. I have clearance to exhume the body and in the spirit of our partnership, I thought you'd want to be there to confirm if it's a match. Call me. This could be big. (phone beeps) Wow. Claire. Someone sounds excited. What are you doing here? I know we were supposed to meet at the restaurant, but I thought I'd surprise you. It's a welcome surprise. Mm. A  very  welcome surprise. I think restaurants are overrated. I find morgues much more enticing. As do I. (laughing) Vincent :  Okay, buddy, I'm not gonna lie to you. This is not gonna feel good, okay, but it's gonna be over quickly. (exhales loudly) Yeah, breathe. And... one. And two. (grunts) Ow! (sighs) Okay? (panting) You didn't count to three. Yeah. Well, waiting for the pain is worse... Worse than the real thing. ...thing. You're glowing. Uh, I'm a guy. Guys don't glow. Do they, Milo? Okay. Hey, no more board sliding, okay? Okay. All right, man. All right. See you, Milo. Thanks. It felt good, didn't it? Helping? Uh, yeah, it did. A little more exciting than...? I mean, wherever it is you live, I keep imagining it's some dark corner in a place that everyone's forgotten. Alex, it's fine, okay? I've made peace with it. But do you need to? I mean, Vince, look at what you just did. You were amazing, just like you always were. I guess it comes naturally. Well, the doctor part, at least. We need that. We need  you. Nobody needs to know. I mean, we're so off the grid here, it's not like anyone's looking over our shoulder. Don't you want that? To be  that  Vincent again? Woman : Miss Salter, can you come in here, please? (sighs) (brakes squeak) Welcome to Fright Night. Should have packed my wooden stakes. Want me to plug you in a night-light? Let's just get this over with. (wooden creaking) Oh, yup. That's a dead guy. The whole opaque skin tone thing. Who was he? Bike messenger that attacked a colleague of mine a few months ago. I think the creature intervened. Sample from the wound here should confirm it. Or if there truly is a creature roaming the city, is it possible that it could be cogent? I mean, wouldn't it have to have feelings and emotions and a sense of justice and morality to only be targeting criminals? Then why do you want to catch it so badly? I don't. I want to understand it. You want to tag its ear and follow its migration patterns? More like question it. If it had a choice, would it retain its evolved abilities, or would it choose to be cured? Cured? Where did that come from? From your research paper. So if it did want to be cured, would you help it? I can't think of a more extraordinary challenge. Would you take this for me, please? 
 
 (distant siren wailing) (bell jingles, door closes) Freeze, buster. Am I supposed to put my hands in the air? You are not going home. Well, as tempting as the lukewarm beer at O'Farrells is... So forget O'Farrells. We'll do something else. Oh... But we're celebrating. And I won't take no for an answer, Dr. Keller. Wow, I never thought I'd hear you call me that again. It's what you are. Come on. (Alex giggling) I can't believe they still haven't fixed that door after all these years. Maybe we were the only ones crazy enough to sneak in here. We shouldn't be here. I'm sorry, but aren't you the same guy that once climbed the Unisphere on a dare? Yeah, well, maybe I'm older and wiser. Or maybe you've just been hiding the real Vincent Keller for too long. What if more has changed than you realize? It wouldn't matter. When I thought you were dead, I used to fantasize about leaving New York and never coming back. I read about this mobile medical team that works in remote Nigeria. They travel from village to village, helping whoever needs medical care. We could do it, Vince. (sighs) We could go together. No. Hey... It doesn't have to be a fantasy. The sooner we get out of here, the sooner we can start living. (shrieks, laughs) I wasn't ready. Ready? Come on. Oh... Hold on. Okay. Slip on the ice. Come on. Hang on! (laughs) (Alex whoops) Whoa. (laughing): Whee... Ah! Oh! Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Whoa... whoo. Oh, my God. I'm gonna fall. Oh, my God. (laughing) (both laughing) Thanks. My pleasure. Man : Don't move! (indistinct radio transmission) You're telling me you don't have I.D.? I just... need to make a phone call. Relax, man, I'm not taking you two in for booking. Yet. Just holding you. But I need to be able to identify you. Come on, sir, please, just don't-don't charge me, okay? Alex : It was just a silly little thing we did. Not a felony. Listen to your girlfriend. This could be very easy-- you give me your driver's license, I call it in, we're done. I just need my phone call. And I need a name. Seems we're at a crossroads here, and we're not going anywhere till I know who you are. (indistinct chatter) Look, I take back every bad thing I've ever said about Heather. These dresses she pulled from work are sick. Okay, so we talk to Pam and then we go, right? What's the rush? Are my earrings too slutty? Too slutty for what? (phone rings) Good point. Chandler. Vincent : Catherine. Meet me at the bar. Vincent? Look, I need your help, okay? I think I'm getting arrested. Okay. Hold on. Tess. Oh, no. You better not bail. I'm not bailing. Just a friend in need. A guy friend? Why do I even bother? Get your ass back here pronto. Will do. (indistinct radio chatter) Officer : We've been over this. You keep stalling me, you're forcing me to take you in. You don't understand. Are you showing off for your girl? Is that what this is? No, I just... It's simple. I need a name. Just tell him your name, Vince. It'll be okay. Officer : Vince. Okay, good. That's a good start. Vince what? (low growl) Vincent : I can't tell you. (growls) Officer : Okay, you know what, sir? I need you to get inside the vehicle. Watch your head. Hey, what are you doing with my C.I.? Who are you? Narcotics. From the 98th. Officer : Little out of your district, aren't you? He was gathering information for me on a case. Are you all right? Yeah, I could be better. Why didn't you tell me you were a C.I.? Why would he tell you? All right, give me your badge. I'll run it through. This look official enough to you? Now get on your walkie and call off the 10-12. I don't run it through... you don't get your C.I. Okay, if you screw up what I have going on tonight, I will bring a world of hurt down on you. You'll be riding your time until retirement giving parking tickets to Eurotrash in SoHo. Relax, sweetheart. I'm just doing my job. Just wait. Okay, I am sorry for putting you in this position and bringing you down here. What the hell is going on with you? I had to lie to a police officer. If he had run my badge, I would've been kicked off the force. And you were taped. Every squad car has a car-top camera on it. Now I've got to cover that up, too. I know, okay? And I can understand that you're upset. I am beyond upset. I-I am mystified. Alex makes you do reckless things that the rest of us have to protect you from. It wasn't her fault, okay? It was mine. Well, then you know that if that cop had booked you, Muirfield would have been here before the ink dried. Don't you think I know that? Okay, I nearly lost control thinking about what would happen if I was taken in. It's not just you. You put Alex at risk. JT. You put  me  at risk, Vincent. If you want to figure out if you can get your old life back, that's fine. But it doesn't erase the life that you have now. You have to figure out what you want. Because... if you're not gonna protect yourself, maybe it's time that I rethink the risks that I have taken to protect you. (sighs) Look, I'm sure this is inappropriate for me to say, but your boss is H-O-T. And as hot as he is, is as kind and generous as he is. Sounds like someone has a crush. Not anymore. He's so smooth. Looks like he's wrapping up a big deal. Those suits he's talking to are with the SEC. They're discussing the initial public offering. Shouldn't you be a part of that conversation? You're the chief financial officer. Noah likes to take his high-level meetings alone. The day before Lisa Hawkes' death, Noah was in an all-day meeting with the SEC. All day, all night. Where were you? I... Back at the office. Waiting for his instructions. The dutiful work wife, right? (gunshot) (sighs) (sighs) You didn't show up for your session this morning. Only authorized personnel are allowed on the firing range. Well, since you're stretching that guideline a bit, why can't I? I'm sorry about the other day. I'm not usually so... Do I get to run with that one? (sighs) I'm-I'm not easy. You can ask... any of my ex-boyfriends. My chief, my partner, my sister, my dad, my... Oh, no, I'll let you take that one. Your...? Let's talk about why you've been spotted nosing around a case that you're not approved to investigate. Lot of eyes around the precinct. So, you take comfort in your work. You're good at it. You have a strong purpose. You're in control. Yeah, you caught me. Seriously, wh-who doesn't do that? What's so wrong if I am committed to a job that I care about? Everything. If you're doing it to escape dealing with your true feelings. The only thing I am trying to escape right now is you. Catherine, you're clearly suffering from PTSD from when Sabrina shot you and you need to... Post-traumatic stress? You want to know what PTSD is? It's seeing my mom get gunned down in front of my eyes. Watching one of the few people who really knew and cared about me leave my life for reasons I don't understand. And it is happening again. Yes. Yes, I have feelings for the most complicated guy on the planet, and-and he doesn't appreciate the risks that I take every day to protect him. He would rather be with someone who doesn't even know him anymore. (rhythmic beeping) It's him. It's our creature. He killed the bike messenger. Uh, for good reason. The bike messenger was a strangler. Even so, this is at least six cases that the creature's interfered with. Not that I have proof of all six, but... I think this is enough to go to Joe. Joe? Who's Joe? My boss. Without the samples that got stolen, I needed a few new matches before I could approach him about forming a task force to track down this thing. But... I thought you didn't want to catch it-- y-you wanted to understand it, cure it. I do. Once we've caught it. JT, look around you. I work in a police station. Good or bad, this thing kills people. It's my job to help uphold the law. Why do you look so worried? Your boss. H-He'll interfere with our research. He'll bog us down with red tape. More like give us the manpower that we need to find this thing. (beeping) Evan : What? Corrupted? No! No, you've got to be kidding me. Maybe there was contamination in the lab equipment. That's impossible. I sterilized everything. (groans) It's not like I can exhume a buried man twice. Pardon me, ma'am. Oh, thank you. Sorry I'm late. I hear it's tough to get a reservation here. So... how's it going? With Evan? Mm-hmm. Couldn't be better. (sighs) He was getting a little close to Vincent for my taste, but I managed to disrupt one of his studies. I snuck into his lab and I corrupted his samples. And he doesn't know it was you? I know how to keep Evan preoccupied. Ignorance is bliss, huh? We'll get to Vincent before the police. Then Muirfield will have everything it needs to move forward. We need you to sign that release understanding your rights in regards to questioning. My heart goes out to you, Pam. Being the other woman can drive a woman crazy. Don't I know it. I'm not the other woman. Uh, did you break up with him? It was mutual. See, now, that's not my understanding. I spoke to a Ben Williams at the party. Cute. Married. Aren't they all. He tells me your relationship with Noah abruptly ended after Noah met Lisa. Said it got a little tense at the office. So, you're left-handed. Yes, I am. Pam, we know the killer had a left hand strong enough to cut that rip cord. We have CSU searching for the knife you used to cut the cord on the parachute. First, they're gonna search your office, then they're gonna search your apartment. And they're very good, our CSU team. They'll find it. Now, if you help us out, and you let us call off the scavenger hunt, we could put in a good word with the D.A. (sighs) He told me he loved me. That what we had was special. Oh... epic. Oh... that a love like ours only came along once in a lifetime. I believed him. Then he met Lisa. And, uh, his head snapped in her direction... and never snapped back. And I should've fought for him then. But I was stunned. By the time I composed myself, they were married. So you killed her? Noah's... strong-headed. (Pam sighs) He was never gonna change his mind. I had ha take action. She was never gonna know him the way that I do. (distant siren wailing) (knocks) Do I need armor this time? (sighs) Sorry, my last apology didn't come out right. You're not here to apologize. You feel what you feel. Something tells me that there's been a lot that you have felt that you needed to apologize for. Your anger towards your mom, your feelings for guys who don't deserve you, apparently. And now you've put your heart out there again after you've kept it locked up for so long, and this lug nut can't see how unique your connection is if he's tempted to fall back into a relationship that's safe and familiar, but not really what he needs, or... not really what he wants. Wow, that was... that was oddly good. Well, you're not the only one whose life isn't perfect. Relationships are, um... uh, they're a pain in the ass. Yeah, you can't make someone love you. But... you can stop trying to escape getting hurt by throwing all of your energy into protecting people. Take a chance. Have you told him exactly how you feel? Exactly what you want? I don't know, I... think it's pretty obvious. You can't even say it to me. I love him. (door opens) (door closes) Hey. Hi. I pulled some strings, and I got the recording from the police car. Last time I cover for you. Thank you. Yeah. Catherine, I am so... No, you... you don't have to say anything. No. Please, let me. You risked your job for me. And Alex. And even if I was gonna be with her, you were willing to protect me unconditionally, and no one... Okay, I-I... I wasn't honest with you. When? (laughs softly) I can't compete with the life you had with Alex. But... I don't want to give up on us before we've even begun. I want to be with you, Vincent. And I'm willing to fight for you. I... I... I don't know if my choice is... so clear. I need to be honest with you. I really miss who I used to be. You know, Vinnie Keller, the doctor, the normal guy. And I think, I really think, I can be that person again. And with me... you'd always be, what? Not normal? Alex is willing to give her life up to go with me. And not here, just... away somewhere from all of this so I can be free, you know, from... from Muirfield. Would you? Would she? If she knew the truth? Vincent, you haven't told her. And until you do, isn't all of this just a fantasy?
