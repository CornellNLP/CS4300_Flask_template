 Catherine :  Being a detective is about drawing lines:  the lines between us and them,  good guys and bad guys, perp and victim. 
 Hey, uh, you must've drunk-texted me. 
 There's no party here. 
 There's... nobody here. 
 Um... call me back before my phone dies, okay? 
 Then there are the lines we draw to protect ourselves: rules, protocol. 
 It's about not crossing those lines... (gasps) because when you do... (scream in distance) (screams) ...bad things can happen. Nine years ago, I witnessed my mother's murder. I would have been killed, too, if it hadn't been for Vincent. Vincent :  I was part of an experimental Special Forces group. Their goal was to create the perfect supersoldier. They made us stronger, faster, better. But something went wrong. They gave orders to kill us all. Somehow I survived and have been in hiding ever since. Catherine :  Until a case brought me back to him but also alerted the group that experimented on him. Now we're both in danger. Vincent : And our best chance at survival  is if we save each other. ♪ ♪ Heather, hey. You are looking at, potentially, the new second assistant at Pierce London PR. I thought you were staying at Brian's tonight. Well... I decided to surprise you with some spicy tuna from Haru. So, what is all of this? Oh, I, uh... I guess I was just feeling a little nostalgic. You know, with Dad's engagement and everything. But that is so sweet of you. Oh, it's... the least I can do. You've been letting me crash here. Oh! Oh, my gosh! Look at us at Camp Moose Pine. Remember how homesick I was? Yep. You'd tuck me in every night and read me bedtime stories until I fell asleep. This belongs on the fridge. Heather... that last year with Mom-- I was away at college, but you were home. Did you notice anything weird? Define "weird." Like, were there any new people in her life? Did you overhear any odd conversations? Okay, this does not feel nostalgic. I think I might have some new information on Mom's case. Mom's case has been closed for nine years. Yes, but... you know it never made any sense to me. The police said it was a carjacking, but... those guys came at us like hired killers. Cat, you also thought you saw a beast. (sighs) Look... what you went through that night,  I can't even imagine. But maybe it's time to leave the past in the past. (siren wailing in distance) (grunts) (grunts) (croaks) Ow. JT? Of course. It's you. Did you not see the fence? You guys don't have a doorbell, and I need to talk to Vincent. No. You don't. You need to stay away. That's what barbed wire means. JT, I-I found something of my mom's. Then put it in a scrapbook and leave. No, it's one of her old research papers. She was an infectious diseases doctor. Every other paper of hers is about parasites and viruses. This? This is about splicing DNA... or something. I-I don't fully understand it, but I... No, what you don't fully understand is that we have managed to stay off the grid for nine years. Everyone thinks he's dead. Then you show up, and people start dying. People were dying before. Like my mom. Vincent was a part of their DNA-altering experiment. He's a doctor, he might know if it's related. I'm a biochemist. I say it's not. JT, please, just... give this to him. (phone ringing) Chandler. You brought a cell phone here? Yeah, I'll be right there. Why not a flashing neon sign? "Vincent Keller lives here." (siren chirps) Who are you making yourself look so pretty for? And if I said you? That would be nice, especially since the other woman I'm here to see doesn't have a pulse. You missed a spot. Don't you have work to do? And it's all over your knees. (sighs) Will you guys get it over with already? And be another notch on his belt? Besides, we work together. And who are you to dish it out, Miss I'm-on-a-Man-Cleanse? Just saying, two of my five brothers met their wives on the force. And now how about meeting your victim? Love when the boss is in such a cheery mood. What do you want me to say? "Nice nonregulation earrings"? What, we can't go out? Name's Gemma Parker, age 22, danced for the Bertrand Ballet Company. ID'd her off her cell phone, which we recovered along with the body. The company's housed in the top floors of this building. Tess : Security? No cameras, no guards. Unis are canvassing for witnesses. What about the woman who called it in? She provided the time of death, along with the party of the year was on 10th Avenue instead of 10th Street. Woman : Oh, my God. Oh, my God, Gemma? Excuse me, Miss. Oh, my God, what happened? Wait over here. (gasping): I came... I came to meet her to rehearse. I'm sorry. You are...? I'm... I'm Victoria Hansen. I'm her understudy. What? Did she fall? We're not sure yet. Last time you spoke with her, did she seem upset or depressed? I... I mean... she was stressed... She's dancing Odette in  Swan Lake, It's, like... the hardest variations in ballet and she was struggling, but... Why? You think she jumped? Excuse me a minute. Defensive wounds. Bruises to the face, cut to the scalp. So she was fighting someone off? Is that what you were doing? When you were rolling around in the dirt? I was not "rolling," I tripped. Look, understudy makes it sound like she could've been primed for suicide. What do you weigh? What? You're probably the same size. What, a buck two? Based on the height of the building and how far into the street she landed, understudy was right about something. This was no accident. Joe :  Okay, coroner's office ruled out  accidental death, so we're looking at a suicide or homicide. Perimeter's secure, so we need to do a sweep of the building, see what we can find. Steadman, Grant, you take the first three floors. Newman, Moore, next three. Chandler, Vargas, theater and above. (clapping hands) Let's go. (classical music playing in distance) Where is that coming from? (music continues playing in distance) (music playing on stereo) This must be where she was rehearsing. Music's still on. Window's open. (music stops) Money's still in her wallet. There's no sign of a struggle in here. I'm gonna keep going. (door shuts) (distant footsteps) (muffled yelling) Shh, it's okay, it's okay. It's okay. It's okay. Vincent, what the hell? I heard you were looking for me. Okay, you can't just show up at my place like that anymore. Says the guy disturbing my crime scene. It's dangerous. Yeah, and JT might come at me with a bat again. (sighs) I read your mom's paper. And? It's about genetic therapy for dengue fever. It's got nothing to do with the experiments they did on me or her murder. Then why were those guys following her? Were they Muirfield? Catherine, don't... Was she working on some other research for them? I don't know. But you told me that they were tracking her. Yes, so you would know it wasn't your fault and you would stop pursuing this. No, but it means that you know more than you're telling me. I know that woman is lying. What?! The other dancer you interviewed. How long have you been up here? Her pupils were dilated, she was sweating, I could hear her pulse racing. You could hear her pulse racing, from all the way up here? Yeah. Okay, well... maybe her pulse was racing because she just found out her friend died. Just trying to help. Vincent, I need help with my mom's case. No, okay? You are playing with fire. These people from Muirfield-- they will not stop until they've buried me and anyone who knows about me. So it did have to do with Muirfield. Tess : Cat? (sighs) Tess : Blood, torn leotard. I don't think she jumped. This girl was up here with someone. Yeah, she was. ♪ Beauty and the Beast 1x02 ♪ Proceed With Caution 
Original Air Date on October 18, 2012 Smoke? No, thank you, and from the looks of Gemma's lungs, she didn't, either. Looked like a smoking lounge. So what was she doing up there so late? Taking in the view? Wasn't exactly a novelty. She'd been at the company four years. Maybe she was with someone she knew, and they got into an argument, which would explain this-- the cut on her scalp. It matches the end of this hairpin. But there are no cells on it, which means, though, there has to be another one. Killer could have taken it. And she had a powder on her hands. Could be makeup? Missing hairpin and makeup. Sound like a catfight to you? Catherine :  Victoria Hansen. When you talked to her, did you get her alibi? She was at home getting ready to go to the studio, but no one was with her to corroborate. According to the company Web site, she played Odette last year. And now she's the understudy? Did it seem like she was lying to you? Yeah, it always seems like they're lying. (sighs) ♪ ♪ So, Victoria has her old role back? I begged the board to postpone the show, but financially, they said we just can't take the hit. Mr. Bertrand, as Artistic Director, you obviously worked closely with both Gemma and Victoria. What was their relationship like? Oh, they were like sisters. Sisters can be competitive. Especially given Victoria's demotion. Bertrand : Demotion? No, she broke her toe. It sounds minor. It's a devastating injury. She had to leave the city for almost a year to recover. It's not so devastating that she can't dance Odette now. Look, Victoria didn't have to kill anyone. The role was already hers. We were just waiting for her to make a full recovery. Wait. You mean, Gemma was only a temporary Odette? That was no secret to anyone, including both the girls. Could there have been another rivalry between them? Maybe a boyfriend? No, neither of them. I would know. The girls are here 24/seven, which is why I was pushing the board to pay for a security system. Anyone... Thank you. Thanks. ...can just wander off the street. Well, actually, one theory is, this is someone Gemma knew. We're gonna need you to show us her locker. From the look on your face, I take it there's usually stuff in here. Overflowing. I don't understand. Did anyone else have access? Not that I'm aware of. Maybe she gave her combo to somebody. Like a sister? Maybe someone threw her things out. They're fresh. Yeah, the only time I toss fresh flowers is when they're from someone I don't like. Do you feel something powdery? Evan :  You're good, Chandler. Powder on her hands was lily pollen. She got flowers from someone she didn't like right before she died. Ex-boyfriend? Overbearing stage mom? Her parents live in Ohio, and so far, no indication of a boyfriend. Thanks. Well, blood work says she had something. We found Mifepristone in her system. Do you just use big words to make me feel dumb? It's a medication, which, at these low doses, is used as the Morning After Pill. And no, it's to impress you. Well, what would impress me more is if you could tell me how Victoria fits in. Ah, sticking with your catfight theory. Maybe it was, like-- I don't know-- a love triangle gone wrong? Those never seem to work out, do they? (brakes squeaking) ♪ I walk on through these streets every night ♪ 
♪ Walk through people who walk too close ♪ 
♪ Into each other they're hanging... ♪ I didn't want to get hit by a bat, and I'm not here about my mom. So, working theory is, secret boyfriend but they're deli lilies, so they're untraceable. You want a drink or something? No, I want to figure out how Victoria fits into all this. Her alibi is weak, but she has no motive. Don't you have a partner to talk to about all this? You're the one who said she was lying. You're the one who said her pulse was racing because her friend died. Okay, so, is she guilty, or is she just trying to cover something up? A lie's a lie, okay? Just like you say you're here about your case, when you're really just wanting information about your mom. What, my pulse is racing, too? A little. I swear, I used to be a normal person. Well, from where I stand, you seem pretty normal. Well, so much for your super-senses. I saw this, um... old photo from camp yesterday. Couldn't even recognize myself. You know, ever since that day, I... I can't let it go. Just the thought that the people responsible for killing my mom are out there. Can't recognize myself, either. Catherine : Look at your hair. (laughs) Yeah. JT : Ah. I thought I heard squealing. You owe me $29.99 for this lumbar pack. Can I, uh...? Yeah. I'll be right back. You were supposed to deal with this. It's not about her mom. Oh, great. So now she's just dropping by for some chit-chat? JT, relax. Relax? Yeah. Don't tell me to relax. I don't tell you to relax. You were gonna make sure she never came back here. And it's not just Muirfield I'm worried about. She's not going to expose us. I'm talking about you. You look like you're about to make her a playlist in there. Come on, JT. We were talking about a case. It doesn't matter what you were talking about. You know what happened last time you were busy making playlists. And this would be worse. She's a cop. Yeah, okay, well, this isn't last time. Catherine : All good? Yeah. So... who are they? Just guys. Were they part of... ? Yeah. Will you tell me about them? Like... (clears throat) Like this guy-- who is he? That's Ray. We used to call him Pammy Sue. His girlfriend back home. He would always talk about her. Convinced she was cheating. Was she? He never got to find out. Vincent, you ever thought about coming forward? About what Muirfield did? You're kidding, right? No, we could investigate them. No, we are not investigating anything. But this photo-- it proves that it wasn't just you. Do you not understand yet what these people from Muirfield can do? Okay, but if we did this right, you could come out of hiding. You could tell me what you know about my mom. And it comes back to your mother. Okay, yes, they were from Muirfield-- the men that were tracking her. That is all that I know. Then we can work together to get these guys. I have access to databases, classified information... Catherine, I'm a criminal. You're a victim. Don't you have some ballerina's secret boyfriend to track down? Yeah, maybe focus on that instead of starting a whole movement. (computer beeping, blipping) Tess : So I haven't been totally honest. Hey. My man-cleanse. I was on a date the other night. Yeah, your earrings kind of gave you away. I just... I can't help it. I broke the diet. Well, unlike you, I cannot find any evidence that Gemma had a boyfriend. It's not a boyfriend. Or why she took that Morning After Pill. She dating a platoon? Um... pop-up. But I did find something. Gemma's Facebook page. In the last six weeks, there are 22 posts from some guy named Allen Arabesque. Arabesque? That is not a real name. "You even make drinking your latte seem graceful." Tess : "You looked smokin' in those red jeans today." God, this guy sounds like a stalker. I'd toss flowers from him, too. Well, let's talk to I.T., see if we can figure out where this Mr. Arabesque is posting from. The IP address  matches the computer at the Bertrand Ballet Company. Secret stalker at work? Well, explains how he knew her day-to-day so well. We cross-referenced everyone's time cards with those postings. The only employee there every time was Julio Ramirez,  the janitor. So what's your theory? He came forward, confessed his feelings. Gave her lilies. She rejected him, he killed her. He would have had access to her locker. Maybe he was looking for those red jeans. Sounds like you two should go find Julio. Julio wasn't even working that night. He has Zumba class on Tuesday. You sure he went? I'm not. 
 
 (door opens) Ma, I'm home and I'm starving. We're in here,  hijo. (grunts) (panting) Man : Easy, pal. Hey! Move. Woman : Aah! I'll take this way. Vincent : Where's my picture? (gasps) Vincent. Now, where is it? I left it in my office. I was going to give it back. Look, you say you're a criminal, but you're a victim, just like my mom. That picture is not about your mother. No, it's about you and it's about those guys in your unit-- Raymond, Matthew, Eric. I ran it through facial recognition. Are you insane? It is evidence. Muirfield tracks everything. Okay... I have to go. You think I just want to show up here, put you and me both in jeopardy if I don't have to? Vincent, I am trying to help; that's what I do. Help who, Catherine-- me, JT? And those guys in your unit. Oh, Raymond? Well, his parents thinks their son died a hero. You want to tell them that they turned him into a killing machine? And JT, you know, he has risked his life the past decade trying to hide me in a warehouse. You shouldn't have to hide. That's why we have to build a case. I am not one of your cases! Vincent, this was a huge injustice. (roaring): Stop! (panting) Cat, I've got the perp. Sorry. There you are. You okay? You're shaking. Yeah, just winded. Julio, we just spoke to the Y. They confirmed you were at the 8:15 Zumba class the night Gemma was murdered. I told you, I didn't do anything. That's not entirely true. You stole her things, and I think you did it because you cared. I just wanted something to remind me of her. She was the only person who spoke to me there. Did you give her flowers, too? No. Julio, you kept pretty good tabs on Gemma. Did you see or hear anything that might help us figure out who did this to her? I don't know what it was about, but, but a few days before she died, she went to a police station. How do you know? I followed her. She seemed upset. Which precinct? 27th and Chelsea, near the ballet studio. Catherine :  Sign-in sheet says  she walks in at 8:40. There she is. Is that Victoria? Ooh, Gemma does not look happy to see her. Gemma never filed a complaint. Maybe Victoria's trying to talk her out of it. Tess, this is dated four days ago. That's the same day Gemma got the Morning After Pill prescription. So she had s*x and then went to a precinct. Sexual assault. Yeah, we should talk to that desk clerk, see if she heard anything. Do you mind taking care of that? There's something I need to follow up on. Yeah, go do what you have to do. Hey. I-I parked far away, I left all of my electronics at work. Come on in. Okay, okay. I'll... I'll only be a few minutes. No worries. May I get you something-- water, soda, turkey sandwich? I think the turkey's still good. What's the cut-off-- five days? What's going on? The turkey or...? Oh, you mean this? Where is everything? I'm assuming with him. Which is where? I have no idea, but wherever it is, it's safer than here, where you keep showing up. Okay, JT, please, I just need to... What, see him again? Look around. This is not a subtle hint. He doesn't want to see you again. Not only do I not know where he is, I don't even know when or if he's coming back, so... see yourself out. Us again. You have a minute? Yeah, of course. I heard you guys think this is a murder. Victoria, did you and Gemma have any issues or arguments just before she died? No. I mean... she'd been on me about these crazy diets I've been on, and I guess I got defensive. But when I was out with my toe, I gained, like, 15 pounds. And Gemma felt the need to report that to the police? Or was this about a sexual assault? Okay... look... I don't really know what happened. That's why I didn't mention it. Who's the guy? I don't know. When I went to meet her at the precinct, she was so emotional, I could barely understand a word she was saying. So you talked her out of reporting anything? No. No, she's the one who wanted to leave. And you let her, knowing what this was about? Catherine : You know, Gemma got those exact same flowers the day she died. Tess : Who gave you those? I don't remember. We get flowers all the time. That picture is from, like, last year. Were they from Joshua? Yeah, I just spoke to the desk clerk at Precinct 27, and she didn't hear anything about pressure, but she did say you and Gemma were arguing about some guy named Joshua. I don't know a Joshua. Desk clerk must have heard wrong. All right. Well, if you remember things differently, give us a call. Yeah. (sighs) So I guess we go back over everything. Yeah, maybe try to lip-read the precinct footage, 'cause now she really seems like she's lying. Yeah, she does. Cat, I'm moving back to Dad's. What?! It's just all this stuff-- the, the board, the boxes. I don't want to remember Mom like that. I didn't mean for you to see that. I'll keep it in my room. But it-it's more than that. After Mom, I felt kind of like I lost you, too. (phone ringing and buzzing) (sighs) It's work. Yeah. I'll just be two seconds, okay? Chandler. Detective Chandler, it's Larry from I.T. Hi, Larry, how's my computer looking? Well, I... I don't know what you did, but it triggered some nasty malware. The entire hard drive has been wiped clean. Catherine :  I ran it through facial recognition. Vincent :  Are you insane? Muirfield tracks everything. Can we tell where it's from? I doubt it. This is some seriously bad-ass stuff. This is like the Ebola of malwares. You should get in here, tell me what's important, I'll see if I can salvage it. (tires screeching) (car door opens) (groaning) Oh, my God. Are you okay? I am so sorry. (grunting) (panting) (grunting) (man groans) (grunting) (grunting) (grunting) (man grunts, Catherine gasps) (Catherine panting, man grunts) (choking) (grunting) (Catherine panting) (choking) (roaring, man yells) (car alarm chirps, Vincent roars) Vincent? (huffing) It's okay. I'm okay. (both panting) (roaring) Man : Want me to call the cops? (panting) I am the cops. Victim shows signs of lacerations and subcutaneous hematoma, indicating blunt force trauma to the head and neck. I jumped out to help him, he came right at me-- classic mugging scam. No visible chest or torso injuries, no evidence of clinical fractures. You were off duty, right? Yeah. Oh, he caught you while your guard was down. I thought it was up. And there were no weapons involved? No, I used the force necessary to defend myself. He fell backwards, must have hit his head on the back of the car. Cortex appears to be lacerated. Guess that's why bikers should wear helmets, even if they are muggers. Yeah, but to cause this kind of impact, for somebody who's a buck two, you must have really been working out. Adrenaline kicked in. Evan, I obviously didn't mean for this to happen. No, of course not. It's just... Are you sure that you did this? Yes. Why would I lie about it? Joe : Hey. Catherine : Hey. You okay? Mm-hmm. You sure? Yes. Evan... so, what am I telling Internal Affairs? That it was self-defense. Catherine :  I've been thinking about  the lines we cross for the people we care about. Like telling a lie, or going too far, no matter who else gets hurt. Who could be that important to you, Victoria? A secret boyfriend named Joshua? There is no boyfriend named Joshua. No boyfriend, but there is a Joshua. We remembered your toe injury. Most athletes-- they get hurt, they sit on the sidelines and watch, but you moved away. For almost a year. And you gained 15 pounds doing it. You know, we, um... we subpoenaed your medical records. Your doctor wasn't an orthopedist. She was an OB. You were pregnant. That's who Joshua is. He's your son. And those lilies-- you got yours last year, right around the time Joshua was conceived. Gemma got the same ones after she was sexually assaulted. Catherine : That's what the fight in the precinct was about. Gemma wanted to come forward, but... No, he's a player, but he's not... He doesn't have to force himself on anyone. Maybe with Gemma, he did. And maybe he pushed her off that roof to keep her quiet. I didn't want to believe... After she went to the precinct, I told him what she was saying. He swore it wasn't true. I didn't have a father growing up. I didn't want that for Joshua. I was just trying to protect my son. He did it, didn't he? Who, Victoria? Who's Joshua's father? (panting) Strong center. Support. Soft fingers. Mr. Bertrand, we need to speak with you outside. I'm in the middle of rehearsal. We spoke to Victoria Hansen. Put your hands behind your back. This is ridiculous. We found Gemma's hairpin in the Dumpster outside your apartment. Yours and her DNA are on it. You're under arrest for the rape and murder of Gemma Parker. Anything you say can and will be used against you... Catherine :  The thing is, it's hard to always stay inside the lines. So we do the best we can. Ah. What, do you have a tracking device on me now? Your TA said you couldn't give a lecture without your skinny caramel macchiato. I wanted to return this. And if you do see him again, maybe you could give this to him, too? I'm sorry I screwed things up for you guys. I didn't realize you were leaving today. Figure I get a jump start on Plan B. Oh, um, I have your key for you. I don't want you to go. The boxes, the board-- I shouldn't have left them out. She was your mom, too. It's okay. No, it's not. I want to get back to where we were. You don't have to. I am not just saying it. Do you have a hickey? (laughs) No, no, this is a work injury. Oh. But if it's ever anything that exciting, I promise I'll tell you. Please stay. I'll go unpack. (both laugh) Okay. And next week's sushi is on me. Twist my arm. Catherine :  But somewhere along the way, I forgot that if you care about someone, you need to pay attention to their lines, too. ♪ Black flies on the windowsill ♪
