 Seemed like a decent enough guy... 
 polite, well-spoken. 
 He bought me some drinks, and we talked. 
 Everything was fine until he was driving me home. 
 What happened? 
 ♪ ♪     He was mad about something I said in the bar. 
 I called him... 
 harmless. 
 He couldn't let it go, and it was like he snapped. 
 He pulled over, got on top of me. 
 I tried to fight him off, but I was too groggy. 
 - Did he have a weapon... 
 - A gun or a knife? 
 No. 
 I just started crying and begging him not to hurt me,     just begging him.

 Vanessa gave him his power back when she stopped struggling.

 Next woman might not be so lucky. 
 ♪ ♪     So they're all jocks, right? 
 We got two football players, lacrosse, crew. 
 I mean, maybe it's some sexual fetish? 
 I don't think so. 
 Kopec was coddled by his mother and overprotected. 
 He was two years younger than everybody in his high-school class     and likely bullied by those same types. 
 Is this some sort of Columbine thing? 
 Well, that would explain the Dylan alias. 
 That was the name of one of the shooters. 
 Screw those guys. 
 In LA, we didn't call 'em shooters. 
 We called 'em failed bombers. 
 Well, maybe Ira saw them as heroes. 
 How? 
 He would've been in grade school when that happened. 
 Ira didn't know these victims, all right? 
 Whatever rage he had, they were symbolic of it,     and he was taking it out on them by proxy,     slowly at first, without anybody knowing. 
 That's why Vanessa doesn't add up. 
 Why does he all of a sudden pivot     and sexually assault a woman? 
 The One Zero symbol is about power. 
 Rape is about power, so is revenge. 
 Ira's escalating because killing strangers in secret     isn't enough for him anymore. 
 He wants to be seen. 
 He wants to go directly to the source of his suffering     and show them who he is. 
 I think I know who that might be. 
 According to district records,     there were     members of Ira's senior class,     but there's only     senior pages in this yearbook. 
 Look at this. 
 He tore two of them out.
