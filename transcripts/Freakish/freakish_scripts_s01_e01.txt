Yeah, I can respect that. Hey. Elmo. She's ignoring you 'cause you're a candy-ass loser. I know Grover is kind of an odd name, but uh, it was my mom's favorite uncle. That's not what your mom said last night. What, mama don't love you? Yeah, she told me she gets sad when she sees you. I wish my mom could see me. Oh, she can't see you? Is she, like, blind or something? [laughing] My mom is dead. Whoa. Dude, really? Heavy. I didn't know. I didn't mean to say it like that. I mean, I did, but not like that.

No way. Are you messing with me? You got that right. [scoffs] You know what I'm in here for? I'm in here for smacking some kid's head on the sidewalk for messing with me... I didn't mean it like that. I was just trying to lighten things up. You guys called me a loser, so I thought it would be funny. Oh, dead mom jokes are hilarious. I know I laugh every time I think of my dead mom. Your mom? [sighs] My mom's not dead, you idiot. But you see how that's not funny? I get it. No dead mom jokes ever again. Don't apologize to me.

Can you get any higher? I'm trying. I said I needed privacy. This isn't what I meant. Oh, okay, so you just want me to go? Come here. That's not what I mean. Am I, uh... interrupting anything? Don't you got someplace to be? Anyplace else to be? Not really. I'll be out in a minute. Do us a favor... go practice some free throws. Oh! [laughs] That's low, man. Really... low. Can you go? Yeah.

You guys are gonna be scraping the gum off the bleachers. For how long? Noodle, got rocks in your shorts? Not me, Coach. Only rocks I got are the ones I was born with. [laughter] You'll be scraping the bleachers until all the gum's off. [indistinct chatter] [alarm blaring] Man : Code nine. Containment breach imminent. Aerial contamination danger. Remain indoors. Close all windows. Seek shelter. Repeat... code nine. On a Saturday? It's a drill. We can just ignore it, right? No. No, we cannot ignore it. Drills exist for a reason. If Keller Chemical ever had a spill, knowing where to go and how to get there could save lives. [scoffs] Of course she's worried about following the rules. You know that tight-ass? I knew her. Trust me, I wish I didn't. Girl : Coach! It's not a drill. The chemical plant's on fire. Please take your time coming down the stairs. Stay calm, because everything's gonna be all right. I have dinner reservations for this Friday. When somebody doesn't respond to a text, it means no. When someone like you really wants to say "no," they usually just say "no." Well, I'm dating the captain of the basketball team. I mean, you get that, right? You know you should be with someone superior, I just don't think you get who that is. [laughs] Okay, your money may have gotten you into a few parties, but it's not enough to get you this. What are you doing here? Mom and Dad didn't say you were picking me up. You're pathetic. [indistinct chatter] My mom was at the plant and said that there was some kind of explosion. Did she say what caused it? My dad said it was a huge fire. [rumbling] [screaming] Hey, let's keep it together, people. Now, this shelter was built a long time ago to withstand just about anything. We're gonna be safe no matter what happens down at Keller. We could last in here for weeks if we had to. You really think we'd be here for weeks? Of course not. I said we could be here, not that we will be. My cousin said that the fire spread to two different buildings. Thank you, Noodle. But I'm sure they have everything under control. The news says that there's reports of a spill. Let me see that. Did you reach Mom and Dad yet? They're not answering the texts either. Yeah, their phones are probably sitting on the counter as they work in the yard. You know how they are. Hey, Mom and Dad did not have work today. They're not at the plant. 
 
 Yo, what you lookin' at? Nothing. Hey, you're that kid that sold your app for a million dollars, but didn't share it with the guy you made it with. [scoffs] Asshole. That matter was settled, and it wasn't a million dollars. Oh, so it was less than a million dollars? Okay, that's cool. I didn't say it was less. Hmm, two alphas in a dick fight. Good times.

I can't be stuck in here with all these losers. Coach : You can't leave here unless I say you can. Watch me. What? Hey! Hey! That's gonna be an extra week of detention for you! Why is he leaving? Should we leave? [rumbling, screaming] Yo, I am not trying to be trapped in here. Yo, this can't be good. Okay, that's it, I'm out. Okay, okay. All right. It's okay. It's okay. Come on. Coach : Diesel! For future reference, you don't leave the shelter until I say you leave the shelter. [dramatic music] ♪ ♪ What the actual hell? The whole place is gone. That doesn't make sense. [explosion] Whoa! ♪ ♪ [explosion, screaming] Come here. You all right? Coach : Let's keep it together. You good? Yo, I can't get any service. Nothing wants to work anymore. Whatever happened, it must have knocked out the system. [line trilling] Mine's ringing! I'm getting through. [line trilling] [busy signal] It was ringing. You guys heard it. It was ringing. Where do you think you're going? Home. I gotta see if they're all right. Son! I don't think that's a good idea. No! No, no, no. You can't go out in that... Move out of the way! That's not a good idea. Girl : Let's get out of here. People, no! Keep 'em dry and high, huh? You know I will. Whoa, hey, are you just gonna let him go outside like that? Just got his truck. Can't just leave it out there. People, stop! You cannot go outside! She's right. My dad works at the plant. He said that when in doubt, don't go out. The news said it was a chemical breach. We have to stay inside, keep the windows closed, and we cannot breathe that air. Don't even think about it. I know you only boss me around because you care about me. I'm bossing you around because you're about to do something stupid. ♪ ♪ You should take care of yourself. Natalie : Addy. Addy! Girl : Not a good idea. Boy : I don't feel safe here. Girl : Let's go. Hey, take care, man. Nah, you take care by staying inside. Bro... What you doin'? You're kidding, right? I have to make sure the twins are okay. You heard what she said. Oh, since when do we listen to her? I'm not letting you... Oh, says you? You can't go outside. My brothers are probably terrified. You know my mom can't handle this. Look outside. You live right by the plant; they're not okay. Don't say that! He doesn't know what he's talking about. Bout to get your ass beat talking like that. You did not just say that with me standing right here. I know what I'm talking about. What I'm talking about is that it's not safe outside. He has no idea what's out there. Why you keep talking, man? The twins might be okay, but there's a good chance you won't be if you go out into that. You don't want them to lose their big sister, do you? ♪ ♪ Grover : It's moving. What is that? ♪ ♪ Everybody get away from the doors! Come on! Move! Let's go! Come on! But... Let's go! Natalie : Addy! ♪ ♪ Go, go, go! Stop! Guys, okay, Diesel, I need you to go into the Tech room and try to get the news on the TV. You, go try to get online. Everybody else, spread out. Get your cell phones out. Try to get a signal. All right? Let's go. We need to make sure that all the windows and the exits are shut tight. There might be a radio in the teachers' lounge. Are we allowed to go in there? ♪ ♪ Oh, my God. It's everywhere. I got no bars. ♪ ♪ I'm not getting a signal. What do we have here? Want some shitty wine? Come on, man, stop playing around. Here we go. Oh, please. Come on. Come on. Please do something. [static buzzing] Please work. [static buzzing] [wind whistling] [ominous music] ♪ ♪ Hey. Any luck? No. I have tried every single room on the second floor and there's no signal anywhere. There's nothing. It's crazy. There's no view at all anywhere. Hey, what is it? Never mind. I... I thought I heard a siren. I don't hear anything at all, except the wind. That's weird, right? I mean, we should be hearing sirens or... or helicopters or something. [wind whistling] ♪ ♪ Nothing? Nope. We're gonna be here for a while. [eerie music] ♪ ♪ [wind whistling] ♪ ♪ Sorry. No, I... wasn't even asleep. I wish I could. I'm this crazy mix of... of totally exhausted and totally wide awake. It's adrenaline. It's shock. Do you think anyone from the lower valley made it? I want to believe they did. I just keep thinking that I just want to be home. And that I realize that home probably isn't even there anymore. I didn't say good-bye to my parents this morning. I keep trying to remember what the last thing we said to each other was and I can't. We didn't say good night last night. I'm not even sure we talked at all yesterday. ♪ ♪ Hey, try to get some sleep, okay? Okay. ♪ ♪ Thanks. ♪ ♪ You look out for her. [chuckles] Do you have any siblings? One older brother, Thomas. Does he still live at home? He was on his way back to Lehigh this morning, but I'm not sure if he made it out of the valley. I'm sure he did. Don't be an asshole. There's no way anybody can know. ♪ ♪ You're only touching me because you actually might be one of the last guys on Earth. Understood. ♪ ♪ [wind whistling] [clattering] [tense music] ♪ ♪ Hello? ♪ ♪ 
♪ ♪ 
♪ ♪ 
♪ ♪ Whoa. Hey, hey. Whoa, whoa, whoa. Wait. Wait. It's me, Grover. Just listen... listen, we got off on the wrong foot. I am so sorry about what I said earlier. I-I talk to get myself out of stuff. I do it all the time. In fact, I'm doing it now. [chuckles] I don't like you. But, Diesel, if you think about it, you started it. I mean, you called me a loser... Because you are a loser. Okay. ♪ ♪ I need to sleep. Yeah. Take that as "apology accepted." ♪ ♪
