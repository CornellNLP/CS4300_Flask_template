 HARDY: Previously on Broadchurch  
 Saturday morning, the day of the party, Trish and me we were in bed together. 
  She's my best friend. 
  If she ever finds out, I  
  - Is Daisy in? 
  - Who are you? 
  Just tell her the boys came round. 
  I heard what happened. 
  I thought maybe you'd need a friend. 
  What did you find out? 
  I got everything you asked for. 
  I found Joe Miller. 
  It's time to put things right. 
  - We did that - No, we bloody didn't Enough of this sh1t, Mark! 
  I am Danny's dad. 
  I'm not gonna stop until I know I've done right by him. 
  HARDY: Aaron Mayford, three years for the rape of a woman at a budget hotel. 
  His victim was tied and gagged, just like Trish. 
  Two years ago. 
  In a field, walking home He tied me up, put a gag in my mouth. 
  I was raped. 
  And I never told anyone. 
  (Rustling) 
  My name is Laura Benson. 
  I live at 19 Hazel Grove, Kingsbere. 
  Why have you come to the station today, Laura? 
  I read about the woman who was raped. 
  It happened to me, too. 
  I was raped. 
  And when was this? 
  Two years ago almost. 
  June 2nd. 
  It was a Saturday. 
  Do you know who the person was, that did this to you? 
  No. 
  I still don't. 
  And where where did the attack happen? 
  I was walking home from the pub. 
  The Rising Sun, in Abbots Chapel. 
  There'd been a big do, place was packed. 
  They had music, late lock-in. 
  The last of us left around half-three. 
  And when you left the pub, did you leave alone, or with others? 
  Alone. 
  What happened when you left the pub? 
  I wasn't far from home. 
  There's a field you cross diagonally. 
  It's just long grass, never got mowed, takes you into the back of Kingsbere. 
  I was right in the middle of it, when I thought I heard something. 
  I was about to look behind me. 
  I don't know why. 
  I could just sense someone running at me. 
  I think he punched me. 
  I got hit from behind. 
  Just knocked me right out. 
  Do you have any idea how long you were knocked out before you came round? 
  No. 
  When I came round, there was something in my mouth. 
  Like thick material, gagging me. 
  My hands were tied behind my back and he was on top of me. 
  He smelt of drink. 
  - What sort of drink? 
  - Spirits. 
  I don't know why I remember that. 
  Cheap spirits. 
  Are you able to describe him to us? 
  I I don't know. 
  I couldn't see him. 
  I'm sorry. 
  It's all right, you're doing really well. 
  What did you do with your clothes from that night, Laura? 
  I washed them. 
  - Never wore them again. 
  - Have you still got them? 
  Did you speak to anyone about the attack at the time? 
  My GP. 
  A week or two after. 
  She told me I should report it. 
  I told her I didn't want to. 
  I didn't tell anyone. 
  Till now. 
  Why didn't you want to report this at the time? 
  I know what happens. 
  I read the papers. 
  I'd had a lot to drink. 
  I mean, a lot. 
  Plus, short skirt. 
  Nice top. 
  Make-up. 
  You think I don't know what they'd do to me? 
  I know how women like me get treated. 
  Not by us. 
  What made you change your mind today? 
  I read it in the paper and I was sick in the toilets at work. 
  I just thought, what if it's him? 
  What if it's the same man? 
  I didn't report it, and he's done it to someone else. 
  I could've stopped it. 
  If I'd been braver. 
  I know what she's going through and it's my fault. 
  (Bell chiming) 
  Thank you. 
  You were very brave coming to see us today, Laura. 
  I don't know how you've kept it to yourself for so long. 
  You're doing the right thing now. 
  I want you to know, it doesn't matter how long ago this was. 
  We'll investigate this as thoroughly and robustly as we can. 
  We'll do everything we can to find the person that did this to you. 
  We'll keep you fully up to date with what happens now. 
  OK? 
  But you will need support. 
  Have you got anyone to talk to? 
  I got married six weeks ago. 
  He doesn't know. 
  Do I tell him? 
  There's no way she could have known the details of what happened to Trish. 
  No. 
  We haven't released them and Trish has told nobody but us. 
  Which means, this could be the same attacker. 
  And Trish isn't his first victim. 
  She didn't report it, cos she thought she wouldn't be treated with respect or dignity. 
  Then we prove to her that she will and we catch him. 
  And we make sure he goes away for a very, very long time. 
  (Gulls cry) 
  Is that him? 
  Yeah. 
  Looks like it. 
  Mum, I'm not sure why you agreed to this. 
  He asked. 
  Can you be sure that it definitely wasn't him who attacked you? 
  We're just talking. 
  You don't have to do anything, unless there's any trouble. 
  If you think there might be trouble What was that, security? 
  Just looking out for me. 
  Does she know? 
  About us? 
  She'll be figuring something's up. 
  It weren't me, Trish. 
  I didn't do it. 
  You know that, don't you? 
  Well, you must know that. 
  I mean Well, why would I? 
  (Exhales) 
  What? 
  The police came to see me. 
  They know about us, about Saturday morning. 
  Yeah. 
  Bloody hell, Trish. 
  This is some kind of mess now. 
  I just think, Cath doesn't need to know. 
  Right. 
  That's what you think, is it? 
  Well, what good's it gonna do? 
  - We owe her the truth. 
  - Do we? 
  Really? 
  How's that gonna help? 
  I'll tell her it was a mistake. 
  Oh, great. 
  Like that's gonna make all the difference. 
  You tell her, I'll have to pack my bags. 
  - It might not be like that. 
  - Course it bloody will. 
  She's gonna find out, Jim. 
  It might as well be from me. 
  You have no idea what you're letting yourself in for. 
  - So, Aaron Mayford. 
  - How was the surveillance? 
  Yeah, it er it was fine. 
  Doesn't look like it from your face. 
  All right, not fine. 
  Steve was off getting food, and Mayford got in the car with me. 
  - What? 
  - Look, the point is, I think we've found something in his work history. 
  Go on. 
  The company that Mayford worked for as an IT consultant had contracts with Flintcombe Farm Shop, and Coopers Telemarketing, which is where Laura Benson works. 
  He has a connection with both women. 
  Let me do this one. 
  - Yeah? 
  - Hi, Aaron. 
  We'd like you to come to the station. 
  To answer some questions. 
  - Who is it? 
  Who is it? 
  - Get back inside. 
  - What for? 
  - Back! 
  I don't wanna come. 
  Aaron Mayford, I'm arresting you in connection with an incident of sexual assault on the 28th of May in the Axehampton area. 
  You do not have to say anything, but it may harm your defence if you do not mention when questioned, something you later rely on in court. 
  Anything you do say may be given in evidence. 
  Understand? 
  Yeah. 
  Bit lazy though, isn't it? 
  You know Woman gets raped, you pull in the local rapist. 
  Even if you don't know the full facts of his story. 
  We need blood, urine, pubic hair and penile swabs too. 
  We'll need your written consent. 
  And if I don't give you my consent? 
  Any future jury could take a negative inference if you refuse. 
  Aaron, can you clarify for us where you were this past Saturday night, between approximately 10pm and 5am. 
  - I was fishing. 
  - Where were you fishing? 
  - Off the beach. 
  - Which beach? 
  The one next to the sea. 
  Between the caravan park and the cafe at Bartons End. 
  Were you anywhere near Axehampton on Saturday night? 
  No. 
  Or the party that was going on at Axehampton House? 
  As I wasn't in Axehampton, I wouldn't have been near the house, would I? 
  You drove your own car to go fishing? 
  - Yep. 
  - What route did you take? 
  Same as usual. 
  Out on the St Andrews Road, onto the coast road, down to the car park. 
  - Same on the way back? 
  - Same on the way back. 
  - That makes sense. 
  - Glad you're happy. 
  Except you didn't. 
  Either way. 
  We've checked the CCTV. 
  Your car didn't go that route in either direction, any time between Saturday afternoon and Sunday afternoon. 
  You must've missed me. 
  We're pretty thorough. 
  You said there were another two men fishing on Saturday. 
  - What were their names? 
  - I've no idea. 
  Don't you ever talk to them? 
  I don't go to the beach at night to talk. 
  I go to be alone. 
  - You like being alone, Aaron? 
  - Yeah. 
  - Find people annoying? 
  - No. 
  I find this annoying. 
  Right. 
  What about this is annoying to you? 
  Being victimised again for something I didn't even do in the first place. 
  What did you catch? 
  - What? 
  - What fish did you catch? 
  - Mackerel. 
  - How many? 
  Dozen or so. 
  It's not difficult. 
  You could probably do it. 
  What did you do with the mackerel? 
  - What? 
  - What did you do with the maquerel after you caught them? 
  Ah, put it in the cooler. 
  Brought it home, at the end of the night. 
  What did you do with them at home? 
  I ate them the next day. 
  - Who cooks them? 
  - Me. 
  You ate all of them the next day? 
  There were a dozen. 
  So we had about six or seven. 
  What did you do with the others? 
  Froze them. 
  Why, do you want a couple? 
  No. 
  So, if we were to go to your house now, your wife would confirm and back up that you cooked her fresh mackerel on Sunday. 
  Yep. 
  And if we were to look in your freezer, we'd find the remainder of the mackerel in there? 
  That's if she hasn't been at them while I've been here. 
  Have you ever been to Abbots Chapel? 
  Oh. 
  She speaks. 
  Answer the question, please. 
  - Dunno. 
  - Do you know the village I mean? 
  Yes. 
  And do you know The Rising Sun pub there? 
  - I don't think so. 
  - Never been in there? 
  Should I have? 
  It's a yes, no question. 
  No. 
  What about Kingsbere? 
  You ever been to Kingsbere? 
  Are you just gonna run through a list of local places? 
  Answer the question, Aaron, please. 
  Have you ever been to Kingsbere? 
  - Yes. 
  - When? 
  I had a mate who lived there. 
  We played football together a few times. 
  Name? 
  Dave King. 
  - Does he still live there? 
  - Don't know. 
  We fell out of touch. 
  It's amazing what happens when you go to prison. 
  Your social life falls apart. 
  Wait, Abbots Chapel is Abbots Chapel is the next village over, right. 
  We used to drink in a pub there. 
  So if that's The Rising Sun, then yes. 
  But not recently? 
  - No. 
  - Few years back? 
  Yeah. 
  2013? 
  2014? 
  Bit before probably. 
  Ever been to Flintcombe Farm Shop? 
  Yes. 
  I used to do the IT support. 
  The company I worked for had the contract. 
  - Who did you deal with there? 
  - The owner. 
  Erm What was his name, Ed? 
  Meet any of the other staff there? 
  No. 
  And you did some work for Coopers Telemarketing? 
  Yeah. 
  Yeah, their system was a right old mess. 
  And was it Laura Benson in charge of their IT contract? 
  No. 
  It was a bloke. 
  Terry somebody. 
  You didn't have anything to do with Laura Benson? 
  I've never met Laura Benson. 
  Do you want the bacon in the fridge or the freezer, cos there's quite a lot of it? 
  You really didn't have to do all this. 
  Oh, it's not me, is it, it's Ed. 
  He wouldn't let me come here without half the shop. 
  I just find it quite hard that everyone seems to know now. 
  Nobody is judging you. 
  Why would they be judging me? 
  Well, no. 
  That's what I'm saying. 
  They're not judging you. 
  You know, we're all here for you. 
  Cath, I-I need to talk to you about something. 
  Is it about the attack? 
  Is it about what he did to you? 
  Because you can tell me anything. 
  I'm not gonna tell anyone, I promise. 
  - I'm your mate, so if - No. 
  Me and Jim, we had s*x. 
  Saturday morning. 
  What? 
  No - Trish - We did. 
  And I'm sorry, it shouldn't have happened. 
  - And if I could take it back - Wait, wait. 
  Just shut up. 
  Just shut up. 
  Shut up, Trish. 
  Just stop talking now. 
  It was you? 
  (Laughs bitterly) 
  Yeah, you see, I thought there was someone on Saturday morning, and I gave myself a talking-to, you know. 
  "Not on the day of your party. 
  Give the man a break. " But you? 
  Really? 
  You! 
  Christ, his standards have slipped. 
  So, er Was it here? 
  Was it? 
  - Yeah. 
  - [scoffs] Jesus. 
  I never knew the smell of mildew turned him on. 
  - I'm sorry. 
  - Why did you do it then? 
  If you're so bloody sorry? 
  He'd come round to look at the boiler. 
  (Laughs) 
  Well, he certainly did that, didn't he? 
  - It wasn't planned. 
  - No, no. 
  It's never planned with Jim, it never is. 
  But he's always ready, when called upon. 
  I mean, you know you're not the first, don't you? 
  You're not even the fifth. 
  Of course you know that, because we've talked about this. 
  I've told you this, I I let you into my confidence. 
  I know, and I'm sorry. 
  If you say sorry one more f*cking time! 
  Erm, so do you love him? 
  - Don't be daft. 
  - How is that daft? 
  Oh, I'm so sorry if that's daft, Trish. 
  Only I married him and he's my husband and I think it's a fair question to ask the woman who had s*x with him more recently than I have. 
  Does he does he know you're telling me? 
  - Yeah. 
  - Oh, Christ! 
  So you've plan You've you've met him, you have talked Since then, you have met my husband and you have planned this. 
  God, this is so Jim. 
  You're the one who gets raped and you're the one who has to tell me. 
  Yeah, well, welcome to my world, sweetheart. 
  I mean, God forbid he should ever clear up his own mess. 
  The police found out. 
  It was all to do with DNA traces. 
  I thought I owed it you, to tell you, because we're mates. 
  Oh, no, no, no, my love. 
  No, we're not mates. 
  No, we just know each other. 
  All right. 
  Here's what I don't understand. 
  Of all the women at that party why would somebody rape you? 
  Doesn't make sense. 
  Get out. 
  (Door opens and closes) 
  (Phone rings) 
  Cath. 
  Don't come home tonight. 
  - Just let me explain. 
  - No, I don't care, Jim. 
  It was a spur-of-the-moment, stupid mistake. 
  - I I felt sorry for her. 
  - (Scoffs) 
  What? 
  So it was a pity f*ck, was it? 
  Did you tell her that? 
  No. 
  Do you know what your weakness is, love? 
  No, but I'm sure you're gonna tell me. 
  You're stupid but you think you're smart. 
  That's a very dangerous place to live. 
  I could set fire to your life whenever I choose. 
  If I were you, I'd be sh1tting myself right now. 
  Yeah, I just wanted to check in with you about Trish Winterman. 
  - See how you're doing. 
  - All right, I think. 
  How do you classify "all right"? 
  Er I think we have a good relationship. 
  She seems to trust me. 
  We're in regular contact. 
  Is something bothering you about it? 
  Nothing. 
  It's all fine. 
  No, something's not right. 
  What is it? 
  Beth, the point of these supervisions is that you're honest with me. 
  I've been where you are, but I can't help you unless you tell me what's going on. 
  She asked me to go along with her, for her ABE interview with the police, when she gave them her full statement. 
  OK. 
  It was pretty harrowing. 
  Just the detail of what happened to her. 
  What he did. 
  I lie awake thinking about it. 
  Thinking who would do that sort of thing? 
  He knocked her out, tied her hands behind her back and gagged her. 
  I can't get it out of my mind. 
  Right. 
  Is that normal? 
  It's totally normal, totally understandable. 
  Sorry, can you just say that all again? 
  So, this is what we found in Aaron Mayford's house and car. 
  Along with a very unhappy wife. 
  First and foremost, he's lying about Saturday night. 
  No mackerel in the fridge or freezer. 
  His wife doesn't like them. 
  They never have them in the house. 
  Why would he lie about that? 
  He knows he'll get found out. 
  Doesn't exactly present like an innocent man, does he? 
  Just cos he's an arsehole, doesn't mean he's a rapist. 
  (Phone rings) 
  No, but these are a match to the condom wrapper found at Axehampton. 
  Yeah. 
  How's he off for blue fishing twine, Miller? 
  Beth Latimer's downstairs saying she needs an urgent word with you. 
  I was having a supervision earlier, and we were discussing Trish's case. 
  Yeah, we had a client about 11 months ago, who disclosed to us, but never took it to the police. 
  And it sounds very similar to the attack on Trish Winterman. 
  What was the woman's name? 
  I can't say that at the moment, client confidentiality. 
  She wouldn't disclose to the police at the time, but I could get in touch with her and see if she would now. 
  - Where did the attack happen? 
  - On the way out of Budmouth. 
  She was on her way home after a party. 
  She was knocked out, gagged with an old sock, tied up, raped. 
  Like I say, she never reported it. 
  Three women, all attacked by an unknown assailant, all after some sort of party or a night out. 
  All three struck by a blow behind, hands tied and raped. 
  This latest woman apparently specifically mentioned that the gag was an old sock. 
  Could he have used that to gag Trish? 
  Possible. 
  If these other two check out, we've got a serial rapist who's been preying on women for two years and nobody's even known it was happening. 
  But that does rule out Aaron Mayford. 
  I checked his dates against the possible date mentioned by Beth's boss. 
  - He was in prison at the time. 
  - But what about the condoms? 
  Available in all good chemists. 
  But he lied about where he was, about driving that route. 
  What if they're separate incidents, different attackers? 
  What, so we've got two rapists, three rapists? 
  I don't know. 
  But Trish and Laura Benson both said that their attacker smelt of spirits. 
  And I'm with Katie. 
  There is something - not right about Aaron Mayford. 
  - Oh! 
  Listen, we're all agreed on that, but time's running out. 
  There's too much contradictory evidence to justify holding him. 
  We can keep the surveillance team on him. 
  Just when we get a grip on this, it slips out of our hands. 
  I know. 
  We need to get the other victim to come forward. 
  In the meantime, you know the lad at the rope factory, Leo Humphries, I'm due to speak to the girl that's his alibi. 
  If you want to come? 
  We have to release Aaron Mayford on bail. 
  I hope we don't regret this. 
  Hi, Ed! 
  All right, Ian? 
  Yeah. 
  Listen. 
  You've got a couple of caravans on site here you rent out, don't you? 
  Yeah, why? 
  It's just I'm in the process of figuring out where to live. 
  So do you think I could rent one off you for a few weeks maybe? 
  This weekend on? 
  I thought you were living with whatshername. 
  Sarah. 
  Er, no, that's not going so well at the moment. 
  She's thrown you out. 
  Yes. 
  Well, she's about to. 
  sh1t, you had everything: a good home, lovely wife. 
  - Yeah, all right, Ed. 
  - And you blew it all. 
  - Enough! 
  - (Chuckles) 
  Can I have a caravan or not? 
  That's all I want to know. 
  - No. 
  - Sorry? 
  No, you can't. 
  Why not? 
  I don't trust you. 
  Trish never trusted you. 
  You don't treat people very well. 
  In fact, I wouldn't be surprised if you were the one that raped her. 
  There you go, sweetheart. 
  Don't climb too high, OK. 
  I hope you don't mind me saying, but you look absolutely shattered. 
  Thanks. 
  It's been a tricky day. 
  But I wanted to make sure I saw you. 
  I did what you asked. 
  I spoke to Trish Winterman, - about you going to speak to her. 
  - Great, thanks. 
  - She didn't want that. 
  - Oh. 
  Right. 
  OK. 
  She's not religious and didn't know how much help it would be. 
  But you did say it didn't have to be about that? 
  It's support. 
  I did, I really talked to her about it. 
  She's not up for seeing you. 
  I'm sorry. 
  Right. 
  You say that like I've let you down. 
  No. 
  Not at all. 
  I am so admiring of you. 
  It's brilliant, the way you've turned all of this into a way to help people. 
  People really respond to you. 
  (Sighs) 
  If I'm really honest with you, I'm a bit envious. 
  When did you last see Mark? 
  Oh, I knew we'd get onto this. 
  Paul, I can't be his guardian any more. 
  - He's going looking for Joe. 
  - Yeah. 
  You know? 
  He hasn't told me. 
  But it's it's been coming. 
  I could see it maybe a year or two now. 
  - This last month he's got worse. 
  - Can't you stop him? 
  Why am I still having to think about clearing up after his sh1t, even after I've thrown him out the house? 
  I can't live in his pain. 
  I put my energy into where people want it. 
  My girls and people like Trish. 
  Beth, if he does something stupid What? 
  It's our fault? 
  No. 
  His choice. 
  You can't rescue someone who doesn't want to be saved. 
  I've never read them, the letters. 
  It didn't seem appropriate and the book didn't need them. 
  So, you know, they're untouched. 
  Thanks. 
  Thanks for those. 
  Best be off then. 
  You off somewhere? 
  Yeah. 
  A little break. 
  Just, you know, just get a bit of space. 
  Anywhere nice? 
  I was thinking maybe Scotland. 
 
 
 
  - Lovely. 
  - Yeah. 
  - Going for long? 
  - Just a couple of days. 
  Nige can manage things at work. 
  Long way to go for a couple of days. 
  You a travel agent now? 
  Might have to be, the way things are going. 
  Do the family know you're off? 
  Thanks for bringing those, Maggie. 
  Look after yourself, Mark. 
  Always. 
  (Gulls cry) 
  - Danielle Lawrence? 
  - Yeah, that's weird. 
  People don't normally know my name. 
  - We're not after ice cream. 
  - Speak for yourself. 
  DS Miller, DI Hardy, Wessex Police. 
  Oh, OK. 
  Where were you on the night of Saturday 28th May? 
  Oh, right, yeah. 
  In the Anglers with my boyfriend, Leo. 
  - What time did you get there? 
  - Half seven. 
  - What time did you leave? 
  - Midnight. 
  We got a kebab. 
  - What sort of kebab? 
  - Doner. 
  - Was the kebab shop busy? 
  - Don't think so, no. 
  How long have you been going out with Leo Humphries? 
  Couple of months. 
  On and off. 
  - Do you see him every weekend? 
  - No, not really. 
  - Was he with you all night? 
  - Didn't take my eyes off him. 
  Whose house did you go back to? 
  His. 
  His dad was away. 
  Leo made me breakfast in the morning. 
  Scrambled eggs. 
  - Is he a good cook? 
  - Not really. 
  Do you mind if I serve these people? 
  Oh, no, I think we're done. 
  We'd like to ask you to come to the station to sign a statement confirming what you told us. 
  Basically just says if you're lying you'll go to prison for perjury. 
  No problem. 
  OK. 
  We'll be in touch. 
  Thanks, Danielle. 
  Hiya. 
  What can I get you? 
  - Do you believe her? 
  - Not a word. 
  I'm getting sick of people lying to us. 
  Where are you going? 
  Where does it look like I'm going? 
  Work. 
  - We're about to eat. 
  - Not bothered. 
  For God's sake. 
  Something to say? 
  I've been cooking. 
  - You watched me cooking. 
  - I haven't watched you. 
  I don't pay any attention to what you're doing. 
  Clive! 
  Oh, hi. 
  I was just going. 
  - Not on my account? 
  - Yeah. 
  Good luck. 
  It's going to be OK. 
  - Everything all right? 
  - Yeah. 
  Just be gentle with her. 
  She's a good girl. 
  What? 
  Is something wrong? 
  Are you OK? 
  Not really. 
  I hate it here, Dad. 
  Well, you'll get used to it. 
  I won't. 
  Not now. 
  What do you mean by that? 
  Someone took my phone. 
  And they went through my photos. 
  And in my photos there was a picture, and they sent it to everyone. 
  What was the photo, Daze? 
  Don't make me show you. 
  Oh sweetheart, no. 
  Everyone in the school saw it. 
  Now all the boys are hounding me and I can't stay here. 
  - When was this? 
  - A couple of weeks ago. 
  A couple of weeks? 
  Why didn't you say? 
  You're never here. 
  - There's a case. 
  - There's always a case! 
  The case is always more important. 
  You said it would be different here. 
  - It is. 
  - No. 
  It's worse! 
  (Phone rings) 
  - Dani. 
  - Police came, like you said. 
  What did you say? 
  What you told me to. 
  They said if I was lying, I could go to prison. 
  Who said you're lying? 
  That's the third favour you owe me now. 
  What you doing Thursday? 
  Dunno, but it'll be expensive. 
  Hello, mate. 
  I'm going home. 
  You know the place. 
  Expensive, will it? 
  Good. 
  I'm up for anything, me. 
  (Engine starts) 
  You have got to be kidding me. 
  Not today, God's sake! 
  I'm still on my break, Ed. 
  I know. 
  But you looked like you might need a cuppa. 
  Oh. 
  Right. 
  Thank you. 
  - Am I attractive, Ed? 
  - What? 
  Come on. 
  It's a simple enough question. 
  Right, well, erm I have to be careful, cos as your boss, you know, sexual harassment laws All right, look. 
  If you didn't know me, would you want to to have s*x with me? 
  Well, yeah, probably, God, probably? 
  Well, thanks for the ringing endorsement. 
  All right, definitely! 
  What sort of question's that, anyway? 
  I don't know. 
  I just wanna know if I'm past it. 
  Course you're not past it. 
  Why would you say that? 
  You're a good-looking woman. 
  You've got a husband that's a bit of a knob, but that's not your fault. 
  Jim slept with Trish. 
  - What? 
  - Yeah. 
  - Jim and Trish? 
  - Morning of my party. 
  She wouldn't do that. 
  I know you think the sun shines out of her arse, but she shagged my husband. 
  Or he shagged They shagged each other. 
  She told me. 
  - What was she thinking of? 
  - Oh! 
  Oh, my God. 
  Full marks for being a shitty consoler. 
  I'm sorry. 
  What are you gonna do? 
  I don't know. 
  He's had women before. 
  I know that. 
  But this just hurts more. 
  I get that. 
  I just thought my life would be that I'd love someone and they'd love me back and it would last my whole life. 
  Why's that so much to ask? 
  (Lucas laughs) 
  Brilliant! 
  (Laughs) 
  Seriously, mate, that is classic. 
  Breakdown lorry broken down. 
  Oh, no, don't be an arsehole. 
  (Jim groans) 
  Yeah. 
  What, you don't want me to tow it for you, then? 
  Very funny. 
  Bad about your party, wasn't it? 
  - Don't know what you mean. 
  - Don't you? 
  You can't really believe it, can you? 
  What some people are capable of. 
  Yeah, I don't want to talk about it. 
  It's all anyone's talking about, soon as they get in the cab. 
  You're the only one who doesn't fancy it. 
  Poor Trish. 
  - How do you know it was her? 
  - Mate, it's all round the town. 
  At least they kept her name out the papers. 
  Hard for you and your wife. 
  Must've been someone you invited. 
  - Must it? 
  - Just by logic. 
  Why are you so interested? 
  Well, I dropped some people there and back that night. 
  Ah, right. 
  So you were around the place, but you weren't invited? 
  Yeah, I see what you're doing there. 
  Ah. 
  Do you? 
  Funny though. 
  I saw you. 
  With Trish. 
  I was parked up, you were out the front, to the side of the house. 
  Looked like quite an intense chat. 
  What are you saying? 
  You were spying on me at my wife's party? 
  Not spying, mate, just saw Nah, you just saw two friends talking. 
  It looked a bit more than that. 
  - Pull over. 
  - What? 
  I said pull over before I smack you hard. 
  Listen, I don't want any trouble. 
  (Chokes) 
  Do you know who you're talking to? 
  Hm? 
  Do you know how many people I know in this town? 
  - Not really. 
  - I know your boss, I know your colleagues, and I know your customers. 
  I can find out about your wife, your kids, your pets. 
  And I can very easily make your life much more of a misery than it must already be. 
  - Right. 
  - Right. 
  (Phone buzzes) 
  VOICEMAIL: You have one new message. 
  (Beep) 
  BETH: Mark, it's me. 
  Can you call me, please? 
  I'm worried about you. 
  Message deleted. 
  Trish Winterman is attacked here. 
  Attack on Laura Benson here. 
  And then a third in Budmouth, here. 
  So, one on private land, one in an open field and the other on the edge of a town. 
  All quite obscure areas, I suppose. 
  You'd only tend to go to those places deliberately, which might suggest someone local. 
  Aye, might. 
  But we're clutching at straws. 
  We are a bit. 
  How about we cross-reference those areas with the addresses of all the guests at the Atwoods' party. 
  OK. 
  We'll give it a go. 
  Thank you. 
  - For coming here. 
  - That's fine. 
  I can have a word with her if you like. 
  Do you think it'd help? 
  I don't know. 
  It's your daughter. 
  I just feel like I'm failing at everything, Miller. 
  That's parenting. 
  It's like one constant slap around the head. 
  Oh, wait. 
  Wait. 
  What if it's not geographical? 
  What if it's seasonal? 
  - What? 
  - All the attacks happened in the summer months, during June right to the end of May. 
  So there isn't a link in where, but there is a link in when. 
  That would point to someone who wasn't here all year? 
  Yeah, a seasonal worker, returning tourist. 
  No, cos how does that connect to the people at the party? 
  - They all live round here. 
  - God, I don't know. 
  That doesn't narrow it down, that makes it wider. 
  I'm doing the best I can, following information. 
  (Phone buzzes) 
  All we need is one name, just one hit. 
  What? 
  It's Arthur Tamworth, from Axehampton House. 
  I was given this number to call. 
  Only, I don't know whether my dog might have found something pertinent. 
  (Approaching footsteps) 
  Closed. 
  Are you deaf? 
  I said we're closed. 
  (Coughs) 
  I just noticed Pedro had it in his mouth. 
  No idea where he found it, or how long he'd had it. 
  I thought I should call you, even though it is just an old sock. 
  One never knows in your line of work, I suppose. 
  Quite. 
  (Distant shouting) 
  - (Whistle blows) 
  - LEO: All right, lads. 
  Let's call it. 
  Let's get your bibs in the bag. 
  Kits to me when you're changed. 
  My turn to wash again. 
  Unless I can get a lucky lady to do it for me.
