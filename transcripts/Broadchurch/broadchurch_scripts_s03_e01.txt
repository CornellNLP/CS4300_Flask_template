 (BOAT RIGGINGS JINGLING) 
  MAN: Here they are now. 
  (CAR DOORS CLOSING) 
  MAN: Thanks for getting here so quick. 
  ELLIE: Why's she on the steps? 
  She came to report, but the front desk was shut. 
  She phoned 101 from a payphone round the corner. 
  - Why didn't you take her in? 
  - She didn't want to do that. 
  - What's her name? 
  - Only got her first name. 
  - Trish. 
  - OK. 
  Did she say anything else? 
  - No. 
  - Right. 
  Thanks, Bob. 
  Hi. 
  Trish, is it? 
  My name's Ellie. 
  I'm a detective with Wessex Police. 
  You called about an attack. 
  A sexual attack. 
  OK. 
  We'd like to take you somewhere we can talk. 
  It's just a short drive away. 
  Is that all right? 
  OK. 
  Well done. 
  The car is just over here. 
  All right? 
  OK. 
  (SOFTLY) 
  Thank you. 
  This is Alec. 
  He's my colleague. 
  We work together. 
  This is Trish. 
  Hi, Trish. 
  I've just put an evidence sheet on the seat, as a precaution, in case any evidence falls from your clothing. 
  It's nothing to worry about. 
  OK? 
  (ENGINE STARTS) 
  (BUZZER) 
  Trish, hello. 
  My name's Anna. 
  I'm a crisis worker here at the SARC. 
  This is a dedicated Sexual Assault Referral Centre. 
  I'm going to be with you all the time you're here, to make sure you understand everything that's happening. 
  If you're feeling unsafe or uncomfortable, in any way, we will stop. 
  Everyone will be led by you. 
  Come on through. 
  We keep these rooms sealed, so we know they're forensically secure. 
  (OPENS DOOR) 
  The FME's on her way. 
  Now, I'm gonna take a mouth swab and the reason we do this first is basically so you can have a cup of tea. 
  OK. 
  Do you mind opening your mouth for me? 
  Well done. 
  All right, darling. 
  - Gonna go right round, OK. 
  - (WHIMPERS) 
  All right. 
  Well done. 
  We're nearly done. 
  OK, just under the tongue. 
  All done. 
  You're doing really well. 
  OK, now. 
  Second request, also comfort-related. 
  Do you think you could do a quick erm urine sample for me? 
  - MAN: Hello. 
  - Hi, Dad, it's only me. 
  Oh, er are you on your way home? 
  Er not yet. 
  Something's come up. 
  - Doesn't it always? 
  - Yep. 
  So, look, I I don't know when I'll be back. 
  How's it going? 
  Have you got Fred to bed OK? 
  Could you er pick up a loaf on your way home? 
  OK. 
  Look, kiss those boys for me and I'll try not to wake you if I'm late back, OK. 
  I don't sleep much anyway. 
  - Not since your mum - Yeah, all right. 
  See you, then. 
  Bye-bye. 
  (FOOTSTEPS) 
  - How's your dad? 
  - Infuriating. 
  How long is he gonna stay? 
  We haven't discussed it. 
  Still, free childcare though, eh? 
  Is she still in there? 
  (SOFTLY) 
  Did you see the injury on the back of her head? 
  Yeah. 
  And marks around both wrists. 
  She's not carrying any ID, or a mobile. 
  - So still no surname. 
  - Do you not know her? 
  It's not Trumpton. 
  I don't know everybody. 
  (DOOR OPENS) 
  Hey. 
  All right. 
  Well done. 
  We're gonna pop back in here and have a chat, OK. 
  OK. 
  Trish, do you mind telling me your surname? 
  Trish, you told the emergency operator that you were attacked. 
  Are you able to tell us where the attack took place? 
  You can't remember, or you don't want to tell us right now? 
  Where do you live, Trish? 
  - West Flintcombe. 
  - Oh, yeah, I know it. 
  That's just off the coast road, - about five miles out of town? 
  - Yeah. 
  Yeah, I live in town, just at t'back of Coniston Field. 
  The man that attacked you, was it someone that you know? 
  I didn't see. 
  Do you remember anything from the attack? 
  Erm I could hear water. 
  Running water. 
  Wh-When I came round, I-I was on my back, on the earth, it was damp. 
  And er someone was erm he-he was having s*x with me. 
  - You're doing great, Trish. 
  - Yeah, you really are. 
  Did you see his face? 
  And you were knocked unconscious before the attack? 
  Can you remember where you were, or what you were doing when that happened? 
  Were you tied up, Trish? 
  (BREATHES HEAVILY) 
  Behind my back. 
  Trish, after the attack, were you left where it happened, or were you transported somewhere else? 
  I-I was left there. 
  How did you get to the police station tonight? 
  Walk? 
  Drive? 
  I'm sorry. 
  You don't have anything to be sorry about. 
  Can you just stand on the sheet for me and I'll pull the curtain across, so it's private? 
  OK. 
  Just one. 
  As gently as you can. 
  Well done. 
  OK. 
  Be back in a minute. 
  (CAMERA SHUTTER CLICKS) 
  ANNA: OK? 
  (TRISH GASPS) 
  ANNA: Nearly done. 
  (SIGHS) 
  Abrasions and bruises at the tops of her legs, signs of forced penetration. 
  Yeah, but the injuries, they don't look fresh. 
  More like a couple of days old. 
  Yeah, I was thinking the same thing. 
  If the attack didn't happen today, we need to find out when and what she's done since. 
  If she's not ready to talk We'll get her home, see if we can find out more then. 
  When was the last stranger rape round here? 
  We don't know it was, until we get more information. 
  We can't know if she knew her attacker or not. 
  I'm not saying it is, I'm asking when the last one was. 
  Well, not in my career. 
  I'm going to refer you on to Wessex Rape Response. 
  They'll allocate an Independent Sexual Violence Advisor who should be in touch within 24 hours. 
  Karen can prescribe the morning after pill, if you think that might be appropriate. 
  We'll also make you a sexual health clinic appointment. 
  I'm going to hand you back to the police now, Trish. 
  I just need you to know there's a lot of support for what you're going through. 
  There are people who will look after you, help you and guide you. 
  You will survive this. 
  We're gonna drive you home now, Trish. 
  Have you got any more questions before we do that? 
  Do you believe me? 
  Yes. 
  Who did this to me? 
  ELLIE: Have you got your front door keys? 
  All right, sweetheart? 
  ELLIE: Do you live by yourself, Trish? 
  Leah, my daughter. 
  She's She's away in London with friends. 
  She's due back tomorrow. 
  OK, don't worry about that for now. 
  What about Leah's dad? 
  We're We're separated. 
  Six months. 
  Does he live nearby? 
  We're gonna need his details. 
  Make a cup of tea, eh, sir? 
  Sure. 
  He makes really strong tea. 
  I think he must've been a smoker and it's killed his taste buds. 
  I quite like the way he makes it, but don't tell him that. 
  (KNOCKING) 
  Every time! 
  Make the tea first and then do your nosing around. 
  Surname's Winterman. 
  Her phone's over there. 
  A number of texts and calls don't seem to have been checked. 
  But the door and the window locks are all secure. 
  Got a light sensor and a burglar alarm. 
  I don't think she's at risk here. 
  What? 
  Unless her attacker's got a key? 
  How's she doing? 
  Has she said anything more? 
  No, not yet. 
  Think she can't remember or she doesn't want to tell? 
  - We've gotta give her time. 
  - We might not have time. 
  If it was a stranger, others may be at risk. 
  - Yeah, all right, I know. 
  - Look at the calendar there. 
  If the injuries are two days old, takes you back to Saturday. 
  - Her mate's 50th. 
  - Yeah. 
  Could explain why she's reluctant to talk about it. 
  Does anyone else have keys? 
  Erm Annie, a neighbour two doors down. 
  Er also Cath, my mate. 
  We saw you had an invite to Cath's party last Saturday. 
  Did you go to that, Trish? 
  Is that where the attack happened? 
  Was it during the party, or after? 
  Was it someone at the party? 
  Erm I was outside and someone hit me on the back of the head, knocked me out. 
  Cath's party was Saturday night. 
  It's now Tuesday morning. 
  So what did you do between Saturday night and reporting the attack last night? 
  I came home. 
  How did you get home? 
  I think I walked. 
  From where you woke up, at the party? 
  But you don't know where that was exactly? 
  It was by the water. 
  What sort of water? 
  Do we have to do this now? 
  It's OK. 
  You're doing really well. 
  So, after you got home, what did you do then? 
  I-I just lay on the bed. 
  I thought if I just lay there, maybe it'd go away. 
  And, Trish, the clothes we took from you yesterday, are they not what you wore when you were attacked? 
  No. 
  OK. 
  What have you done with those clothes? 
  I-I threw 'em in the corner of my room. 
  OK. 
  When we're done here, we'll go to the party location. 
  - OK? 
  - Yeah. 
  TRISH: I'm supposed to be on shift today. 
  Where do you work? 
  Flintcombe Farm Shop, on the till. 
  We can drop in, tell 'em you're not well and you need some days. 
  No. 
  My mate, she works there, too. 
  She'll She'll wanna know what's happened. 
  I'll sort it. 
  Don't worry. 
  Do I get police protection? 
  No. 
  Sorry. 
  Is there anyone I can call to be with you? 
  No. 
  - A friend, or a relative? 
  - Did you not hear me? 
  OK. 
  I don't want anyone knowing. 
  Trish, you need support. 
  You can't be on your own. 
  But I am. 
  I just am. 
  I shouldn't really do this, but, erm I'm gonna give you my number, OK. 
  Any time you wanna talk, you need anything, you give me a ring, all right? 
  Thanks. 
  - Don't tell him I gave you it. 
  - Thank you. 
  You must be exhausted. 
  How are you feeling? 
  Dirty. 
  We will need you to come in and make a full statement, - soon as you're ready. 
  - OK. 
  You'll hear from your ISVA soon and you've got your panic alarm. 
  The police can be here quickly. 
  No-one will mind you using it. 
  Thank you. 
  We'll see you soon. 
  (CAR ENGINE STARTS) 
  - How far away is this place? 
  - Five-minute drive. 
  She said the attack took place near water. 
  - You think she meant the sea? 
  - I dunno. 
  Why say "water" and not "waves" or "sea"? 
  Why did she wait, Miller? 
  Why did she not report it sooner? 
  Why did she come home? 
  Everyone responds differently. 
  We've already lost (EXHALES) 
  60 hours? 
  If the attack happened at the party, that's a long list of people to interview and eliminate - and the attacker's still out there. 
  - (MOBILE PHONE RINGS) 
  - Hello? 
  - TRISH: Ellie? 
  - Trish? 
  - Yeah. 
  - Are you OK, Trish? 
  - Yeah. 
  Yeah. 
  I I was checking this number worked. 
  I've locked all the doors and the windows. 
  Great. 
  - Try and rest. 
  - Right. 
  Look, you've got the panic alarm. 
  Don't be afraid to use it. 
  And you can call me any time. 
  How am I gonna tell my daughter? 
  Look, try not to think of that for now. 
  OK, we're gonna take all this one step at a time and there'll be plenty of us around to support you. 
  OK. 
  - Thanks. 
  - OK. 
  Bye, Trish. 
  - You gave her your number. 
  - Oh, don't start. 
  - So what? 
  Yes, I did. 
  - Your personal number! 
  - What have I told you? 
  - She needed it. 
  - Every time! 
  - Pardon me for being human. 
  We investigate, support services support! 
  - Support services aren't there. 
  - You can't do this. 
  - Once before. 
  - Twice before. 
  - Oh, are you keeping count? 
  - Yes! 
  If I'm so annoying, why did you come back? 
  - You're always having a pop. 
  - There's a protocol. 
  I did not miss this, the constant berating. 
  - She can't ring you all the time. 
  - She's been raped! 
  ALEC: I didn't know this was out here. 
  - What is it, part of a village? 
  - No, it's an old manor house, with a few cottages nearby that used to be for estate workers. 
  Oh, and there's a little church. 
  But there's no shops or services, or anything like that. 
  "Axehampton House is available for private hire for weddings, birthdays and anniversaries. 
  " Not today, it's not. 
  It's not gated, so anyone can just drive up here. 
  There's another road in, on the other side, by the house. 
  - What are you doing? 
  - I've been up half the night. 
  You didn't let us stop for a coffee or a bacon sarnie. 
  Aha! 
  Oh, God, what's that? 
  It's a goodie bar. 
  I keep them handy for Fred. 
  - How long's that been in there? 
  - I don't care. 
  - Ooh! 
  Do you want half? 
  - No. 
  Wait. 
  Do you hear that? 
  (DISTANT RUNNING WATER) 
  (WATER FALLING INCREASES) 
  I'll take a look down there. 
  - Anything? 
  - No. 
  Perfect spot if you don't want to be seen or heard, though. 
  Look. 
  Possible dried blood on that stone there. 
  And here I think that's the corner of a condom wrapper. 
  All with the sound of running water nearby. 
  I think this is where it could have happened. 
  This is DI Hardy. 
  I'm at Axehampton House. 
  We have a possible crime scene. 
  Sorry, sorry. 
  It's been one of those days. 
  Who am I kidding? 
  It's always one of those days. 
  Right. 
  Let's talk about you. 
  Five clients so far. 
  How are you finding things? 
  Good, I think. 
  Sort of. 
  It varies. 
  Erm Karen, my last one, that was tricky. 
  I don't think I handled that brilliantly. 
  Karen's vulnerable. 
  She has had an incredibly hard life. 
  Yeah. 
  I feel bad for letting it get to me, cos I knew it'd be difficult, but, it's just, sometimes, I don't know if this is for me. 
  Of course. 
  Listen, everyone who's worked here has been where you are now. 
  You have to decide is it too demanding, - or can you push on through? 
  - What do you think? 
  This job isn't easy. 
  We're meeting women in crisis. 
  Some have mental health issues. 
  It's challenging. 
  But I've watched you in training, in pilot sessions, in real-life situations. 
  You've got something special to offer, Beth. 
  We need you. 
  This client referral just came in. 
  (PHONE RINGS) 
  (ANSWER MACHINE BEEPS) 
  Hi, this is Trish and Leah. 
  Leave us a message. 
  Message for Trish. 
  This is Beth Latimer. 
  I've been given your number. 
  I think you might be expecting my call. 
  I was hoping to come and see you either today or tomorrow so, if you want to give me a call back, my number here is 01632 960131. 
  Look forward to talking. 
  Thanks. 
  Bye. 
  PAUL: You're just going to stand and watch? 
  Now, you think I'm being weird. 
  Yeah, you are being a bit weird. 
  I'm interested, aren't I? 
  Who buys a book like that, in the town where it happened? 
  - People care, Mark. 
  - Do they? 
  I reckon they just like a freak show. 
  Even Even after three years. 
  Why don't you go in there? 
  It was your decision to do the book. 
  Biggest mistake of my life. 
  It's done more harm than good. 
  Hello, petal. 
  Thank you for waiting. 
  WOMAN: Could you sign it to Tony, please? 
  God's sake, Mark! 
  Sorry, Paul. 
  Look, I understand you're regretting it now, but skulking in the bushes watching isn't gonna help. 
  - Tell him, will you? 
  - I have been, for the past half hour. 
  Worried I'm gonna spoil your sales, Mag? 
  That's not what I'm saying and you know it. 
  You gave me the interviews. 
  We can't stop it being out there. 
  - I know that now, don't I? 
  - (SIGHS) 
  Exterior scene, middle of nowhere, open to the elements, already two days behind before we've even started. 
  Confirm the blood traces found on the stones match Trish's. 
  Is this where she was unconscious? 
  We don't have that information. 
  Likely somewhere by the house. 
  So the scene could be from here, all the way up to the house? 
  You don't like to make things easy for us, do you? 
  Sorry if we're inconveniencing you. 
  We couldn't find drag marks or footprints. 
  You might have more luck. 
  See if you can find any evidence of her attacker having a hiding place - near the house. 
  - Right you are. 
  We've got preliminary fragments of blue twine or wire from the victim's wrist wounds. 
  She was struck on the back of the head, so we're looking for anything that might have been used. 
  Violent attack, ligature traces, possible use of a condom. 
  Starts to look like it was premeditated. 
  You do your dusting and leave us to sort the conclusions, eh? 
  I think you should say sorry to Brian. 
  Sorry, Brian. 
  And you wonder why we call him sh1t Face. 
  Let us know what you find. 
  - ALEC: This is where Trish works? 
  - ELLIE: Yeah. 
 
 
 
  We'll let them know she won't be in for a while. 
  Can I ask you a question, Miller? 
  Course. 
  How long have they been calling me sh1t Face? 
  Since you first arrived. 
  - Really? 
  - Yeah. 
  I'll put your receipt in the bag, all right? 
  Thank you. 
  - ALEC: Cath Atwood? 
  - Yeah. 
  Hi. 
  DS Miller, DI Hardy, Wessex Police. 
  Could we have a chat? 
  Oh, OK, right. 
  Ed? 
  Can I have a couple of minutes? 
  - Can't you see she's on shift? 
  - For God's sake, Ed! 
  DI Hardy, DS Miller, Wessex Police. 
  Who are you? 
  Ed Burnett. 
  It's my shop. 
  What's it concerning? 
  - Concerns her. 
  - Can you make it quick? 
  - No. 
  Can we talk in private? 
  - Yeah. 
  One of your staff members, Trish Winterman, she won't be in for a while. 
  Erm Personal reasons. 
  Why am I hearing this from you? 
  Thanks for letting us borrow Cath. 
  ELLIE: We're investigating an incident that took place - at your party, Saturday night. 
  - Bloody Ed! 
  He was as much at fault as Jim. 
  Don't let him tell you otherwise. 
  They're just like a couple of drunk school kids. 
  Was there a fight at the party? 
  Yeah. 
  Why? 
  Is that not what this is about? 
  There's been an allegation of rape. 
  You're kidding? 
  No. 
  But who? 
  Oh, my God, who? 
  We can't reveal details. 
  Yeah, but I knew all the women who were there. 
  sh1t. 
  Trish. 
  Is it Trish? 
  It's just that she's not been in and she's not returning any of my calls or my texts. 
  Is she all right? 
  Is she all right? 
  We'll need a copy of the full guest list from Saturday night. 
  Erm yeah, sorry. 
  Erm Yes, you will need to speak to my husband Jim, he did the invites. 
  His garage is in town. 
  I'll give you his number. 
  How many people were at the party? 
  I don't know. 
  We didn't keep tabs on final numbers, we were just telling people to pitch up if they fancied it. 
  Roughly? 
  70, 80 How many men? 
  Erm fiftyish. 
  There were 50 men at your party on Saturday? 
  Yeah, at least 50. 
  Trish Winterman of West Flintcombe has made an allegation of rape against an unknown attacker. 
  Er the incident is alleged to have taken place at Axehampton House on Saturday night. 
  She was attending a party thrown by Cath and Jim Atwood. 
  She was knocked unconscious somewhere within the grounds and was raped, possibly close to the lake. 
  It's unclear whether her attacker was known to her. 
  Myself and DS Miller took her to the SARC in Poole last night. 
  We're awaiting preliminary forensics and SOCO are starting work at the scene now. 
  - When did she report this? 
  - Last night. 
  But the attack happened on Saturday. 
  It's a bit of a gap. 
  Are we sure she's genuine? 
  When you've completed your Sexual Offences training, Katie, you'll understand we start from a position of believing the victim. 
  - Sure, but - Given the injuries, the details of her account, matching facts at the possible scene and an assessment of her emotional state, we're working on the assumption it's genuine. 
  I was just asking the question. 
  All right, you're new, we forgive you. 
  As of yet, we've made no public statement. 
  The Chief Super is aware. 
  Once we've got initial forensics, we'll make a call on the risk to public safety. 
  In the meantime, not a word gets out. 
  - (PHONE RINGS) 
  - Sorry, sorry! 
  Hello? 
  Yep, this is Mrs. 
  Miller. 
  Why? 
  What's the matter? 
  What? 
  I am so sorry. 
  He's so sorry. 
  - Aren't you, so sorry? 
  - Yeah. 
  Where did you get this? 
  I didn't mean to press - (PLEASURABLE GROANING) 
  - I don't know How do you? 
  I'm sorry. 
  p0rn! 
  Why? 
  It is something we're having to deal with - a lot more recently. 
  - So it's not just him. 
  Tom and another boy have been caught supplying links and files to a number of other students. 
  What? 
  Oh, for God's sake! 
  I don't know what you consider acceptable I don't consider this to be acceptable in my home! 
  I don't watch this! 
  We don't have p0rn in my home! 
  We are excluding Tom and the other student for one week. 
  (SARCASTICALLY) 
  Oh, brilliant. 
  Well done. 
  I'm mortified and disgusted at his behaviour. 
  - It will not happen again. 
  - I'm sure we all understand how tough it has been for you as a family No, no, no, don't say that. 
  It isn't about that. 
  - It isn't. 
  Thank you. 
  - (SCHOOL BELL RINGS) 
  Tom! 
  Hurry up! 
  (INDISTINCT CHATTER) 
  You're 15! 
  Well, everyone watches this stuff. 
  You are not everyone. 
  You have to be better than that. 
  I will not have you be your father's son. 
  ALEC: This is a live situation. 
  Prioritise this one. 
  We absolutely cannot afford to wait. 
  Preliminary results, whatever you can tell me, soon as you can, thank you. 
  Sorry. 
  Didn't mean to keep you waiting. 
  - It's fine. 
  Everything OK? 
  - New case. 
  - Can you talk about it? 
  - No. 
  Sorry. 
  - How's the homework? 
  - All done. 
  I'm gonna hang out in town with the guys for a bit, maybe go round one of their houses. 
  - "The guys"? 
  Which guys? 
  - Over there. 
  I'll be back by ten. 
  You'll still be at work, anyway. 
  OK. 
  Just make sure you all stick together. 
  All right. 
  Don't walk home alone if it's after dark. 
  Call me if it gets late. 
  I'll give you a lift, I won't mind. 
  - Dad, what's going on? 
  - Just be careful, OK? 
  Don't mention this to your mates. 
  - Well, thanks for freaking me out. 
  - You're welcome. 
  See you later.

  Yeah, what's up, Cath? 
  Trish was raped at our party on Saturday night. 
  What? 
  But how do you know? 
  The police have just been here. 
  They're after the invite list. 
  sh1t. 
  OK. 
  Er Are they sure? 
  I've just rung her. 
  She's not answering. 
  Do you think I should go round? 
  I dunno. 
  If she's not answering to you, she probably wants to be on her own. 
  I ju I just feel like it's our fault. 
  - How was your English exam, Chlo? 
  - It was all right, I suppose. 
  Had none of the questions they told us to prepare. 
  I'm sure you did your best. 
  - When's French? 
  Thursday is it? 
  - Yeah. 
  Feel like I can't remember anything even though I've had a year longer than everyone else. 
  We're proud of you, you know, for sticking at it. 
  - Aren't we? 
  - Definitely. 
  How was your day, Mum? 
  Had my appraisal today. 
  Seemed to go all right. 
  And I got a new client. 
  Haven't seen her yet. 
  - She doesn't live too far so - Well, that's not good. 
  A woman nearby got attacked? 
  You know I'm not supposed to talk about it. 
  If a woman round here has been attacked, I don't want either of you anywhere alone after dark. 
  We don't need you looking after us. 
  Thanks for dinner. 
  - Dad, don't go. 
  - Mark, come on. 
  Bye, little Liz Bug. 
  Look after your mum and sister, will you? 
  See you Thursday, after the French exam? 
  Yeah, cinema. 
  - Mark, I didn't mean to - Bye. 
  It's bad enough he hardly comes round any more. 
  You don't have to say things like that.

  - Hello? 
  - Ellie? 
  - Trish, are you all right? 
  - I remembered. 
  There was something in my mouth. 
  He'd put something in there, to gag me. 
  I thought I was going to suffocate. 
  And I started to choke and and he knew I was coming round, so he put his arm over my eyes, so I couldn't see him. 
  And then, I I think I passed out. 
  When I woke up again, the thing in my mouth was gone and my hands weren't tied. 
  This is all really useful stuff, Trish. 
  Why did he choose me? 
  (KNOCKING ON DOOR) 
  What the hell are you doing here? 
  I was passing, saw your light on. 
  What? 
  Halfway up a hill, at two in the morning? 
  I was hoping you'd still be awake. 
  Don't be a twat about it. 
  Trish called me and told me her attacker put something - in her mouth to gag her. 
  - Yeah. 
  I just got initial forensics. 
  And? 
  Cloth fibres found in her mouth swabs confirms what she's told you. 
  They also found traces of blue fisherman's twine in her wrist wounds where he tied her up. 
  And her attacker definitely used a condom when he raped her. 
  Oh, God. 
  I have to make this a Gold Incident, Miller. 
  This wasn't opportunistic, it was planned and premeditated. 
  Trish's attacker went to that party intending to commit rape. 
  Which means we have a sexual predator who is a danger to the public.
