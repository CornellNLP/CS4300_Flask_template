 'Previously on Broadchurch...' 
 Danny? 
 Give me a call, sweetheart. 
 I want to know where you are. 
 The body of an 11-year-old child was found on Harbour Cliff beach at Broadchurch. 
 Alec Hardy. 
 I know. You got my job. 
 He was strangled. We are treating Danny's death as suspicious. 
 Until we're ready, this remains confidential. 
 Broadchurch Echo. 
 I can't talk to you. 
 Why have you released his name? 
 It's on Twitter. 
 Who told the journalist? 
 They made it look like an accident. 
 What are they asking? 
 Where were you last night? 
 I told you, I was on a job. 
 Is there anything you want to tell me now? 
 If you or someone you know has any information please come forward now. 
 We will catch whoever did this. 
 How are you doing, lovely? 
 OK. 
 You had nightmares. 
 Did I? 
 You were shouting in your sleep. 
 What was I saying? 
 Couldn't make it out. 
 You said "Danny" at one point. 
 Will I have to talk to the police? 
 Yeah, at some point. 
 But not today, I don't think. 
 Unless you can think of anything that might help us. 
 No. 
 When I have to talk to them... can it be with you? 
 I don't think so. 
 "I hope you and your family find some peace." 
 What do you write that doesn't sound glib? 
 They'll appreciate it. 
 Heard anything on when that tent will be off the beach? 
 When they're done, I suppose. 
 No time soon. 
 I just hope they find the killer, and chop his balls off. 
 Come and have a drink later. 
 Hey, how you going? 
 Good. Loving the room, thanks. 
 Olly? 
 Yup. 
 Hi. 
 Oh! Karen. 
 Nice place. 
 Yeah, well, you know, when the fuses haven't blown. 
 So, I don't suppose you've got a spare desk or just a corner of the office I can squirrel myself away in? 
 We are part of the same newspaper group, after all. Of course. 
 Maggie Radcliffe. I'm the editor. 
 Karen White, Daily Herald. 
 You're here fast. 
 I remember your stuff on the Yorkshire Ripper. 
 Long time ago now. 
 Is there a spare desk? 
 I'll be no bother, just... 
 No. 
 Well, we're a very busy operation here. 
 Yeah. 
 And if I give you a desk, what happens if others start showing up? 
 Not to worry. Thanks anyway. 
 I'll see you soon. 
 DI Hardy? 
 Karen White, Daily Herald. 
 I know. You came to the briefing last night. 
 I just wondered if I could buy you a cup of tea. 
 You're astonishing. 
 Well, if you need me I'm staying at the Trader's. 
 Give me the details, CID will call you back when someone's available. 
 Sir, for you. You need to get yourself organised up there. 
 It's Saturday and the phone lines can't cope. 
 Hello. Broadchurch Police. 
 Morning. We got you a coffee. 
 I don't drink coffee. 
 Course you don't. 
 Frank said you were out at the cliffs. 
 I walked Danny's paper round. 
 There's a hut on Briar Cliff, mile and a half along the coast from where Danny's body was found. 
 Find out who owns it and the car park below. 
 Collect the CCTV from the camera there. 
 How're we doing on the house to house? 
 We've got five uniform allocated, two probationers, one who can't drive, and one who'd never taken a statement before. 
 That's all they've given us? 
 It's a summer weekend. 
 You've got three music festivals and two sporting events within 100 miles, so all the officers are attached to them until Monday. 
 Don't tell the family. 
 Uniform are moaning they're having to take calls. 
 We're getting more phone lines put in. 
 Clear desk policy end of the day, yeah? 
 SOCO are at work on the beach, it's gonna be a long one. 
 Oh, we're still going through the Latimer house. 
 Sorry, are you listening? 
 Danny's skateboard. Danny's mobile. 
 Priority. 
 Also, main suspects. You know this town, who's the most likely? 
 If the boy was killed before he was left on the beach, where's the murder scene? 
 What are you doing now? 
 We've managed to find a Family Liaison Officer, I'm gonna take him over to the Latimers. Oh, and Jack Marshall, owns the paper shop, rang in, he said he'd remembered something. 
 You're welcome. 
 Couldn't stop thinking about him... all last night. 
 I help run the Sea Brigade. 
 Danny'd been coming about 18 months, on and off. 
 Cheeky lad, but a good heart. 
 It matters, a good heart. 
 You said you remembered something about seeing Danny. 
 Must have been end of last month. 
 Around quarter to eight on a Wednesday morning, on the road leading up to the clifftops on the way to Linton Hill. 
 I saw him. 
 What was he doing? 
 Talking to the postman. 
 Well,... not talking. More like... arguing. 
 He was quite a way away, but the body language was pretty clear. 
 Then Danny stormed off. 
 The postman was calling after him. 
 You're certain it was the postman? 
 Well he had a bag, and one of those high-visibility jackets. 
 Who else is going to be out that time in the morning? 
 Can you describe him for me? 
 He was a long way off. 
 Medium height, short brown hair, I think. 
 It was only after you were in yesterday that I remembered. 
 I should've mentioned. 
 Erm, they're elimination prints, to rule out your prints from anything we might find here or anywhere else. 
 Is this necessary? 
 If she wants us to do it, it's necessary, isn't it? 
 Did anyone sleep? 
 No. So, erm, Pete will be your Family Liaison Officer. 
 It's his job to keep you up to date with the investigation, answer your questions, or talk about any questions we might have. 
 Why can't you do that? 
 No offence. 
 None taken. 
 It's a very specialised job. 
 Pete's just completed his training. 
 Yeah, you're my first! 
 But you know us. 
 The best thing I can do is to find who killed Danny and I will. 
 When do we start arranging the funeral? 
 That has to wait, I'm afraid. 
 Until we have the person responsible in custody, Danny's... 
 His body is... Oh, god, I'm sorry to talk about it like this - it's the most valuable piece of evidence we have. 
 We can't allow him to be buried until we're sure we've got the right person and enough evidence to convict them. 
 So we can't have him back? 
 Not yet. I'm sorry. 
 He's not evidence, he's my brother. 
 I understand, I really do. 
 Give her the piece of paper. 
 We made a list. 
 People who might have done it. 
 Oh, right. 
 These are all your friends. 
 We know. 
 DS Miller. 
 Excuse me. 
 £500 in cash, taped to the underside of the bed frame in Danny's room. 
 You're kidding. 
 And we found this. 
 Cocaine. In the daughter's room. 
 Bloody hell. 
 So, tell me about Broadchurch. 
 OK. It's the only town for about 20 miles. 
 There's one road in, one road out. 
 Market twice weekly... 
 Yeah, I've got all that. 
 Who lives here? 
 Well, a lot have been here all their lives, generations. 
 Some of them haven't even been 50 miles outside of town. 
 And then there's the incomers. 
 Young families, left cities when they had babies, came here for the schools and the sea. 
 We get tourists in the summer, but we're a working town mainly. 
 Much crime? 
 It's mostly theft from lock-ups, odd bit of drug use, drink driving. 
 Seriously. 
 I do the weekly crime report in the paper with one of the uniforms. 
 About 30 offences a week, but mostly all are minor. 
 We've never had a murder. 
 And that's the sort of story you do at the Echo. Yeah. 
 Clubs, schools, council meetings. 
 Maggie says we celebrate the everyday. 
 And what about you? 
 What do you want? 
 I want to work on a national. 
 I want to be you, basically. 
 Well, be careful what you wish for. 
 How come you were here so quick? 
 Look, if I'm gonna report on this, I need to understand the town, the people. 
 You help me, and I might be able to help you. 
 What do you think? 
 Have you told my Mum and Dad about the wrap? 
 Not yet. 
 Please don't. It's not mine. 
 It was in your room. 
 I don't use it, I swear I don't. 
 Do you deal it? 
 No! 
 This isn't anything to do with Danny, I promise. 
 It was a mistake. A big mistake. 
 If you don't use it or deal it, did someone leave you holding it? 
 And you're protecting that person. 
 It's one tiny wrap. 
 Oh, we'll tell your Mum that. 
 No, you said you wouldn't. 
 Chloe, possession of a class A drug is a criminal offence. 
 Dealing a class A drug is a criminal offence. 
 I was just passing it on. 
 That is dealing! 
 You won't get in trouble if you tell me the truth. 
 Who gave you the cocaine? 
 Becca Fisher. 
 At the hotel? 
 I work for her some weekends. 
 And where did the money come from? 
 What money? 
 Oh, Chloe, don't get smart. 
 I don't know anything about any money, I swear. 
 Why is Becca Fisher giving a 15-year-old girl cocaine? 
 Oh, God, I'm gonna get in such trouble. 
 Chloe Latimer says you supplied her with a wrap of cocaine. 
 What? You're kidding! 
 Why would she say that if it's not true? 
 There was this couple, down from London for a long weekend, in a suite, spending money, they asked me if I could get them some coke. 
 Chloe was working for me that weekend, I asked her if she knew where I might find some. 
 She took so bloody long, the couple had gone - I gave it back to her. 
 Not now - thanks, Emily. 
 Sorry. 
 Where did Chloe get it from? 
 She said a friend. 
 She didn't tell me his name. 
 She said he didn't deal, but he knew where to get stuff. 
 Did her brother have anything to do with it? 
 It's... it's nothing to do with that. 
 Do I get arrested? 
 We will have to process the offence. 
 Can we keep this quiet? 
 I could lose my license. 
 Fix a time to come down the station, make a formal statement. 
 Cocaine though. 
 It must be a one-off. 
 They're not that type of family. 
 Chloe's not that type of girl. 
 Nobody ever is. 
 No, I live here. 
 We don't have these problems. 
 A couple of arrests for possession every month on the estate, but no more than that. 
 Are you just making one for yourself? 
 Ellie, you might want to take this one. 
 What are you doing? 
 Phone line. 
 I hope so. 
 Clean desk policy, Frank. 
 Yes, ma'am. 
 Miller. Postman. Come on. 
 Yeah, that's my round, up past Briar Cliff. 
 And did you work the route last month? 
 I've done every delivery out there for the past eight or nine weeks, I'd say. 
 Did you ever see Danny Latimer? 
 Yeah, all the time. 
 He used to deliver papers up there to a couple of houses, including the hut. 
 When I heard, I thought: I've only seen him a couple of days previous. 
 And did you ever talk to him? 
 Particularly the last week in June. 
 I might've waved and maybe said hello. 
 I didn't really know him to talk to. 
 That's it? Just hello? 
 What else would I say? 
 You didn't ever have a conversation with him? 
 No. 
 Or an argument? 
 What am I gonna be arguing with a paper lad about? 
 Where were you Thursday night? 
 Thursday, I'd have been with the boys. 
 We got hammered. 
 Six of us, there was. 
 Finished at four. My missus woke me up at seven, I was out cold. 
 We're gonna need the names of all those you were with. 
 But I mean you don't think I had anything to do with it? 
 It's just to rule things out. 
 Nothing to worry about. 
 All right, thanks Kevin. Bye. 
 Don't say that. 
 Don't say what? 
 No need to worry. 
 Why not? 
 Don't reassure people. Let them talk. 
 Can I just say: you can't just rock up here and try to mould me. 
 I know what I'm doing, and I know how to handle people. 
 And you can keep your broody bullshit shtick to yourself. 
 Can I make anyone a... cup of tea? 
 Where's the crisps? 
 Why's there no crisps? 
 You don't want crisps. 
 I do. 
 Where are you going? 
 Where do you think? Out. 
 You should clear it with Pete. 
 I'm going to the shop, that's all. 
 Let me go for you. 
 I want to go myself. 
 Give me a list. 
 Mum, stop smothering me! 
 Sorry. 
 I want to help you. 
 You can't. 
 We're all so sorry. 
 Beth. Beth? 
 Are you all right? 
 I'm pregnant. 
 Have you told anyone? 
 I only found out about two weeks ago. 
 You don't want to tell Mark? 
 It's complicated. 
 Of course. 
 Do you have anyone that you can talk to? Your Mum, maybe? 
 No. Not now. And don't you go telling her either. 
 What are you gonna do? 
 Can you stop asking me bloody questions? 
 Sorry. I do that. Apparently. 
 I'll... leave you alone. 
 You can come and see me. 
 If you need to talk. 
 I don't know if I believe in God. 
 It's not compulsory. 
 I've been praying for you ever since I heard. 
 For Danny, too. 
 Thank you. 
 You sure your mum and dad don't know you're here? 
 They're watching telly. 
 We could go to the hills. 
 Have a drink. 
 The police found the coke. 
 What? 
 They were searching the house for stuff about Danny. 
 What did you tell them? 
 Nothing. 
 Well, where did they think you got it from? 
 I didn't say. 
 They didn't push it. Stop worrying. 
 Stop worrying?! 
 Just cos they didn't ask today doesn't mean they'll just forget about it. 
 Chlo, I can't have the police round, my uncle'd kill me, you know that. 
 I know. Let's make this all about you! Piss off, Dean! 
 I'm sorry. 
 No. Go on, I want to be on my own. 
 Don't be like that. 
 I'm serious. Go! 
 Or d'you want me to tell my mum and dad? 
 
 
 
 Excuse me, have you got a light? 
 Are you Chloe? 
 Why? 
 I'm really sorry what happened to your brother. 
 I'm guessing this meant a lot to him. 
 What're you doing with that? 
 You can't leave it down there. 
 It'll end up in the papers, and you won't see it again. 
 How do you know so much? 
 I work for the Daily Herald. 
 I'm not talking to the papers. 
 I know, and you're right not to. 
 I just wanted to bring that, to save it from being nicked. 
 If it was my brother, I wouldn't want strangers having it. 
 Thanks. 
 Can I borrow your phone? 
 Thanks. 
 What you doing? 
 Look, I won't call you. 
 I won't come to your door. 
 I won't stop you on the way to the shops, like others are going to. 
 But if you or your family need to speak, or you just need a friend when it's getting a bit much, you call me. 
 And thanks for the light. 
 Look after yourself. 
 I mean, God knows, it's terrible for the family, but... it's gonna cripple the rest of us, too. 
 I mean look at you here, eh? 
 Saturday night and the place is deserted. 
 Thanks, Laurie. 
 I needed that pointing out. 
 We were banking on this six weeks. 
 With the bloody recession, and the rain, this is the worst slump we've had in decades. 
 Five independent shops we've lost from the high street, and now we're a murder town. 
 No-one's gonna come. 
 You know what, Laurie? I think the town has other concerns right now. 
 Like Danny's family. 
 Well, I leave all that to you, eh? 
 Pastoral care, and all that. 
 You know, we've got to get rid of that bloody great tent on the beach. 
 Who's gonna come to a beach with bloody CSI sat next to them? 
 All right, stop! 
 It's not even been 48 hours. 
 Eh, I'm just calling it as I see it. 
 No, actually, you're being inappropriate. Tone it down. 
 You want a to-do list, Laurie? 
 Send some flowers to the family. 
 Put a picture of Danny in your shop. 
 Collect for a cause Danny liked. 
 Get a hold of yourself and grieve respectfully. 
 And then, when the killer is caught which I'm sure will be soon - the beach will re-open in full, and we make sure people still come here and buy things. 
 Until then, be a decent person, would you? 
 She's so right, it's embarrassing. 
 What's that? 
 Thai was closed, chippie was the only place open. 
 I can't eat that. 
 You don't eat fish and chips? 
 What kind of a Scot are you? 
 It's all there is. 
 Eat, or be hungry. 
 Postman's alibi's confirmed, four times. 
 He was with his mates all night, the night Danny was killed. 
 So Jack Marshall got it wrong then? 
 Do we have any reason to disbelieve the postman? 
 How's Marshall's eyesight? 
 Does he have any reason to lie? 
 And do we think that the money and the drugs found at the house are connected? Is that cash for the supply of cocaine? 
 You know you do this incessant list question thing? 
 Bam-bam-bam-bam, so no-one's got a chance to reply. 
 It's like you really enjoy it. 
 Do I? 
 Yeah. Can I eat my dinner, please? 
 First murder. How you finding it? 
 Grim. 
 What did you make of Mark and Beth's list? 
 Heartbreaking. 
 Some of their best friends, Danny's teachers, babysitters, neighbours. 
 They're traumatised, not thinking straight. 
 Or smart. We never asked for a list. 
 Maybe they're trying to direct where we look. 
 See you. 
 Good night, sir. 
 Taking focus away from their household. 
 They didn't kill Danny. 
 You have to learn not to trust. 
 Oh, do...? Oh right. That's what you've been sent to teach me - the benefit of your experience. 
 Look at your community from the outside. 
 I can't be outside it. 
 If you can't be objective, you're not the right fit. 
 No, I am the right fit - it's you who's not. 
 Taking promotions meant for other people, not accepting a coffee or a bag of chips without a great big sigh. 
 Sorry,...sir. 
 You need to understand, Miller. 
 Anybody's capable of this murder, given the right circumstances. 
 Most people have a moral compass. 
 Compasses break. 
 And murder gnaws at the soul. 
 Whoever did it will reveal themselves, sooner or later. 
 No killer behaves normally over time. 
 You know the people here. 
 Look for the out of the ordinary. 
 Follow your instincts. 
 My instinct tells me the Latimers did not kill their son. 
 Quiet! 
 Hello again. 
 What do you want? 
 DI Alec Hardy, Wessex Police. 
 What's it about? 
 Anthony Ryan, who owns the hut up on Briar Cliff, said you had the keys. 
 I clean it. 
 He said he'd phone ahead and let you know to have the keys ready. 
 My phone's dead. 
 Well, I need the keys. 
 Just want a look inside the place. 
 Why? 
 Routine. 
 Is it about that boy? 
 I'll have the keys back with you as soon as we're done. 
 Show me that ID again. 
 You'll have to sign for them. 
 I don't want any trouble if you don't come back. 
 Sure. 
 Let me know if there's anything interesting. 
 I know we're all struggling to understand what's happened over the last few days. 
 And it's at times like this that we... question... our faith. 
 Why would a benevolent God allow this to happen? 
 Have we been... abandoned? 
 I'm sure we're all asking that question after the events of the last week. 
 Hello! 
 I'm sure it's just a shower, we'll go to the playground later. 
 I got you a hot chocolate. 
 I don't want it. 
 Come on. Let's just have a bit of time doing something normal. 
 It can't be normal though, can it? 
 You are safe. OK? 
 Me and your Mum will protect you. 
 This is a terrible, unspeakable thing that's happened, but nothing like it will ever happen again here. 
 You can't know that, though, can you? 
 You can't be sure. 
 Hey! Hey! 
 I thought I'd sneak literally five minutes. How is everyone? 
 All right. All right, Trev. 
 How's it going then? 
 Fine. 
 You close to sorting it? 
 Trev... 
 I can't talk about it. 
 He's not bothering you, is he? 
 All it is, is: are we keeping the kids in? 
 Should we be with them every second? 
 That's all! 
 I just want to see my kids. 
 I'm sorry, Ellie. 
 Come on! Trevor! 
 You all right? 
 Liz. How are you coping? 
 Oh, it's not about me, is it? 
 It's Beth and Mark I worry about. 
 You're his grandmother. 
 You can't just shut it out. 
 This helps. It was a good service. 
 It meant a lot to me, and to the others who came. 
 19 people in a town of 15,000? 
 After the last couple of days. 
 Hardly credit it, can you? 
 I swear, I've tried everything. 
 But people never know what they need until it's given to them. 
 That's what we want from you. 
 All of us. 
 Go out, connect with the town. 
 I'm praying that's why God placed you here. 
 Our challenge is your challenge. 
 Help us. 
 Miller! 
 What is it? 
 CCTV from the car park below the hut. 
 Mark Latimer. 
 When is this? 
 The night Danny snuck out of his bedroom. 
 He said he was out on a call, what's he doing? 
 Waiting for someone. 
 How do you know? 
 I don't, but I bet I'm right. 
 Tape's run out. 
 Is there another one? 
 No. They just use the one tape and rerecord over it, to save money. 
 Bollocks! 
 Sorry. 
 Are you done? 
 No, no, it's not that. 
 It's Danny Latimer you're doing, isn't it? 
 Why? 
 It's something to do with water. 
 What are you saying? 
 I've been told it's something to do with water. 
 Told by who? 
 I...I have, erm... 
 I have this thing where I... 
 I get... I get messages. 
 Psychic messages. 
 Oh, for God's sake, who let you in? 
 No, the thing about the water, that's important. 
 Don't just ignore it. 
 Oh, come on, out. 
 It's something that I'm supposed to tell you. 
 Erm... like, he was... he was in a boat. 
 Like he was... he was put in a boat. 
 Yeah, yeah. 
 I don't... I don't know why. 
 And who told you this? 
 Where did you get this from? 
 Danny. 
 And state your address for the tape. 
 57 Whitney Road, Lewiston. 
 Where is that? 
 Erm, it's about 30 miles from here. 
 I cover the full region for the company. 
 And you're saying Danny Latimer wants us to know that he was put in a boat before he died. Yes. 
 And I want you to know that nothing offends me more... than cranks wasting police time. 
 I receive messages. 
 I don't... I don't ask for them. 
 I don't question them. 
 Did the message happen before or after you were sent to install extra phone lines here? 
 After. 
 Amazing. I love this - the phone engineer who hears voices from the dead. 
 I don't want this. 
 It comes to me. Look, you don't want to listen, that's fine. 
 Oh, you're a reluctant psychic. 
 A child has died, and you come in with this self-indulgent horseshit. 
 Did you ever meet Danny Latimer? 
 No, never. 
 D'you know the family? 
 No, I don't think so. 
 Do you have any evidence relating to the death of Danny Latimer? 
 No. 
 Interview terminated at 6:17pm. 
 You know what happens around a murder, Mr Connelly? 
 A whole industry grows up, of groupies, and rubberneckers, and people who want to touch the case. You're just the first. 
 Don't let me see you round here again. Get him out. 
 She says she forgives you. 
 About the pendant. 
 Every big case, these people come crawling out the woodwork. 
 What did he mean about the pendant? 
 Do you know? 
 He has the bloody nerve to come in our office! 
 Check his details, find out who he is. 
 Rule him out, just to be sure. 
 What are you going to do now? 
 Mark Latimer lied to us about where he was that night. 
 Danny's social network profiles from his hard drive. 
 They've just come though, all his posts. 
 "3rd May: going to get a lock on my door, keep all this crap out. 
 7th May: she's totally having s*x with Dean. 
 12th May: Dear Dad, remember me? 
 I'm the one you used to play with. 
 12th May: I know what he's doing." 
 See you later. 
 Ellie. 
 'Well, first and foremost, all of our prayers are with the Latimer family. 
 It's obviously a very worrying time, but we all believe the investigation will uncover what happened. 
 We're a very strong community, and I hope the people who live here know that the church is here for them to offer whatever support they need, throughout the coming days - faith or no faith. 
 I know the Latimer family quite well and we will do everything we can to support them at this time.' 
 'Reverend Paul Coates...' 
 Hey! I was watching that. 
 Where are you going? 
 Mark! 
 Mark! Mark! 
 Well don't just stand there, get after him! 
 Enjoy your moment of glory, did you? 
 What? No. 
 We don't need you. 
 We don't need your support. 
 Your God left my son for dead! 
 Too slow, mate. 
 You OK? You all right? 
 Erm, Thursday night, the night Danny went missing, where were you? 
 On a call-out. 
 Call came through... I dunno, early evening, about half six. 
 Whole family's system had packed in, you know? 
 How long did that take? 
 Most of the night. 
 It was a nightmare boiler, so I was there pretty late. 
 No. There was no call out. 
 We have CCTV footage of the car park at the top of Briar Cliff. 
 You were there at 7:30. 
 Er,...so you're snooping on me now? 
 Well, checking CCTV in the area. 
 Now, what did you do that night? 
 What am I, a suspect? 
 The first thing we do is eliminate people from the investigation. 
 You tell me where you were, who you were with, how long for, I can eliminate you from suspicion. 
 It's entirely methodical. 
 You don't give me those facts, I can't eliminate you. 
 And if I can't eliminate you, you're a person of interest. 
 In the murder of my own son? 
 I'm sure this is all very straightforward. 
 I er... I met a mate. 
 You know, we drove off together, and then he dropped me back at the car park and er... I came home. 
 What time? 
 Three or four in the morning, maybe. 
 What's your mate's name? 
 I can't remember. 
 Sorry? 
 You can't remember the name of your friend? 
 Where did you go? 
 I think we just had a drive around. Bite to eat. Bit of a drink. 
 You think? This was three days ago. 
 Yeah, and a lot's happened since then. 
 And is there any reason you wouldn't want to tell me the name of your mate? 
 This is only about who killed Danny. 
 Nothing else. 
 Um... 
 It'll come back to me. 
 I'm just knackered. 
 I haven't been sleeping, you know, all the stuff on the news. 
 Head's not straight. 
 When you came in, you went straight to bed? 
 Yeah. 
 Can your wife confirm what time you came back? 
 No. She was asleep. 
 Come and see this. 
 That's blood. And it's a match for Danny's fingerprint. 
 Danny was killed here? 
 We think so, yeah. 
 Killed here, and then moved two miles down the coast to where we found him. 
 Why would anyone do that? 
 The boys have been all over this place. It's been ruthlessly cleaned, except for that and something else in here. 
 Mark, who you met - it's a big gap in your recollection. 
 Sorry. 
 What? 
 I'm at the hut. 
 SOCO think it's where Danny was killed. 
 We found his prints and some blood. 
 Right. Anything else? 
 Yeah, the whole place has been cleaned. 
 But we've also found another set of prints by the sink. 
 I messaged them through to run a match against elimination prints. 
 'They belong to Mark Latimer.'
