 Previously on Broadchurch  
 Trish Winterman of West Flintcombe has made an allegation of rape. 
  What, so you come for the cab driver? 
  Where were you on Saturday night, Leo? 
  I was out with my girlfriend. 
  - Wessex Police. 
  Who are you? 
  - Ed Burnett. 
  This is my shop. 
  Why did you have a fight with Ed Burnett at the party? 
  Don't you think you should tell me a little bit, I mean, anything about what's happened? 
  (PHONE CHIMES AND VIBRATES) 
  HARDY: When did the message come in? 
  About an hour ago. 
  I told her to call you. 
  You did the right thing. 
  She's gonna be all right, isn't she? 
  Yeah. 
  It will take time. 
  TRISH: It's from him. 
  I know it is. 
  He's got my number. 
  He must know where I live. 
  Do you think he's watching us now? 
  Do you know what it might mean? 
  Shut up about what? 
  No idea. 
  Do you have any sense who the message could be from? 
  No. 
  Trish, could this text be from the man that you slept with on the morning you were attacked? 
  I told you, I'm not talking about him. 
  But he has your mobile number, right? 
  It's not him. 
  We are probably gonna retrieve his DNA from your bed sheets anyway. 
  It's quicker if you tell us. 
  Look, I'm sorry I wasn't good enough - in that interview. 
  - It's not about I should be allowed not to tell you. 
  It was before the attack. 
  It's not connected. 
  - We don't know that for sure. 
  - I know that for sure! 
  What if you're wrong? 
  We know how hard this is. 
  Yeah, right, you know how it feels, to be tied up, to have your body violated. 
  And to feel like it's your fault. 
  Because all I'm thinking every second of every day right now is how did I cause this? 
  What did I do to make this happen? 
  I don't know how that feels, no. 
  We will find the man who attacked you. 
  We will find whoever it was that sent the anonymous message. 
  But it'll take longer without your full cooperation. 
  I'm not telling you who I slept with. 
  (PHONE VIBRATES AND CHIMES) 
  For God's sake, Ian, turn it off. 
  (SIGHS) 
  Hi, it's me. 
  Can you talk? 
  LEAH: Yeah. 
  Mum's in her room. 
  The police just left. 
  Are you sure about this, Leah? 
  Do you think I'd make it up? 
  Does she Does she know who it was? 
  I don't think so. 
  Listen, I'm I don't know what I'm not sure what to do. 
  Do you think I should come round? 
  You can't. 
  She told me not to tell you. 
  Why would someone do this, Dad? 
  I'll keep her phone in an unsealed exhibit bag. 
  If anyone wants access to it, they'll have to go through me. 
  And we can get on to finding the source of the text first thing. 
  (YAWNS) 
  You look dead on your feet. 
  Thanks a lot. 
  What do you think, Miller? 
  Do you think her attacker sent that text? 
  Well, it doesn't make sense. 
  Why send it now? 
  The news has been released. 
  It's gone public. 
  Unless the news reports triggered it. 
  If it was her attacker, it makes it much more likely it's someone she knows. 
  Are you really gonna drink that disgusting stewed tea? 
  Shut up about what? 
  Does he think she knows his identity? 
  Or is there more she's not telling us? 
  I've got to go home. 
  I've got to go to bed. 
  I suggest you do the same. 
  We've an early start. 
  Say she knows her attacker What's the motive? 
  Someone angry with her? 
  (SNIFFS) 
  Jealous about something? 
  Wants to punish her? 
  Was it just a bit of drunken flirting that turned violent? 
  With respect, sir, there was no flirting. 
  He knocked her out. 
  It was about power and control, - not s*x. 
  - I know that. 
  And you were too hard on Trish today at her house. 
  I know you're tired, I know you want a result, but you've got to go easier. 
  I'm scared he's going to do it again. 
  That's why I'm pushing. 
  I've got to go home. 
  - Good night. 
  - Night. 
  You, er, you could've come to the house. 
  Trish has been raped. 
  Yeah, I know. 
  Well, how can you know? 
  Leah's only just told me. 
  The, er, police, they came to see me. 
  After the party invite list. 
  The police came to see you and you didn't tell me? 
  It wasn't my place to tell you. 
  Anyway, I didn't know if we was allowed. 
  - Have you seen Trish? 
  - (SCOFFS) 
  I'm not exactly going to be high on her list, am I? 
  - Do you know what happened? 
  - I haven't got a clue. 
  I was hoping you might have. 
  Well, only what the police said. 
  That it was at the party and it was late in the evening. 
  Oh, Christ. 
  Listen, um you know me and Cath will be there for Trish, and for you, mate. 
  All the problems that you guys have been having, it doesn't matter now. 
  What's important is Trish gets whatever help she's gonna need and the police get the bloke who who did that to her. 
  Yeah. 
  Thanks. 
  Look, I I think I might be in the sh1t. 
  What do you mean? 
  The police came to see me at the school. 
  Before I knew it was Trish. 
  Can you believe they didn't tell me? 
  Jim, will you promise this won't go any further? 
  I'm not gonna promise anything until I know what you're talking about. 
  I told the police what I did at the party, who I saw, how I got home. 
  But I made it all up. 
  You what? 
  Ian - I blacked out. 
  - Oh, for God's sake Well, I'd had a row with Sarah, cos she hates all of you, and you hate her, and she'd gone. 
  I had a row with Trish, and then I started drinking tequila. 
  You can vouch for me. 
  Yeah? 
  If it comes up, you can, you can tell 'em what I'm like if I drink tequila. 
  How much do you remember? 
  Mate, you had a lot of booze on that night. 
  And it'd been a tough week. 
  I just remember waking up on the grass near the lake. 
  For Christ's sake, Ian. 
  - The police are gonna check. 
  - I know. 
  What do I do? 
  I don't remember anything. 
  My wife was being raped, and I don't know where I was. 
  (KNOCKING) 
  Can I help you? 
  Is Daisy in? 
  - Who's asking? 
  - You her dad? 
  Who are you? 
  - She'll be at the park. 
  - She'll be at school. 
  What's your names? 
  I'll make sure she knows you stopped by. 
  Just tell her the boys came round. 
  The boys? 
  Right. 
  Thanks, Daisy's dad. 
  All right? 
  What are you doing here? 
  - Why are you smiling? 
  - Nice to see you too. 
  I got you some water. 
  You never take enough. 
  Thanks. 
  - You around this afternoon? 
  - Er, yeah. 
  What about Chlo? 
  Yeah, her exam finishes midday. 
  Why? 
  Is it all right if I come round? 
  Like, one o'clock be all right? 
  - What for? 
  - I'll tell you later. 
  Go on, don't wanna ruin your run. 
  OK. 
  (DOORBELL RINGS) 
  (PHONE RINGS) 
  Hi, this is Trish and Leah. 
  Leave us a message. 
  (BEEP) 
  I heard what happened, Trish. 
  I had to come here. 
  I had to see you. 
  I don't know what to say. 
  I'm so sorry. 
  God, that sounds so useless. 
  Listen, look, whatever's gone on these last few months, if you need me, I'm here. 
  I want to be here for you. 
  I love you, Trish. 
  Trish Winterman received an anonymous threatening text message from a blocked number late last night. 
  Finding who sent that message is a priority, to establish a) 
  whether it's a serious threat and b) 
  if it's from the attacker. 
  If it is, it's the best lead we have. 
  So, who on our list of possible suspects would have access to Trish's number? 
  Miller has Trish's phone. 
  We need the contacts and the message history examining. 
  Now, Trish's ABE was less productive than we'd hoped. 
  She's still very traumatised. 
  We'll need to conduct interviews with her when she's more recovered. 
  But She did make us aware that she had s*x with a man, not her husband, on the morning of the attack, though, er, as of now she's currently reluctant to tell us his identity. 
  - Helpful of her. 
  - You know what, Harford, I'm not in the mood for your noise this morning! 
  No, sir. 
  What else from the ABE, Miller? 
  Erm, we know that Trish was driven to the party in a taxi by a guy named Lucas of Budmouth Taxis. 
  Erm, he claims his radio was out of service for the whole night, but he's got no clear alibi for his whereabouts during the time of the attack, which we're trying to nail down. 
  We think between 11pm and 1am but Trish is unclear what time she stepped outside and how long she was unconscious for. 
  We are looking further into the driver's, erm, work history and family details. 
  Where are we on the piece of condom wrapper at the scene? 
  Er, we've identified the brand and I have a list of local stockists, erm, including vending machines. 
  So I'm just working my way round trying to find out any recent purchases, particularly in the days before the attack. 
  Sooner the better. 
  We've lots to get through. 
  Time's against us. 
  So far, we've interviewed 27 of the guests at the party. 
  You've all been allocated actions. 
  I want results on those by the end of today. 
  Keep taking DNA swabs. 
  Make a note of all those who refuse to give a sample. 
  Harford, do the summary board. 
  I want every man's details and movements before you knock off tonight. 
  Got that? 
  Yep, sir. 
  Right, on you go. 
  He doesn't like me, does he? 
  It's not about you. 
  He's worried, and he's tired. 
  He doesn't have to bite my head off. 
  Miller! 
  Come on. 
  (DOORBELL) 
  Tom? 
  Yeah, I'm coming, Grandad. 
  I er I have to report these two to you. 
  Thank you very much. 
  And, er what are they in for, then, a lecture on morality and Bible teachings? 
  (LAUGHS) 
  No. 
  A five-minute talk on why they're idiots, then two hours' hard labour digging up weeds in the churchyard. 
  It's the school's preferred punishment. 
  Sounds as though they're not the first. 
  They are very much not the first. 
  - How are you doing, all right? 
  - Me? 
  Oh, yeah, yeah. 
  I'm sleeping in my daughter's box room while she works herself to death. 
  Yeah. 
  It's the retirement I always dreamed of. 
  You must still be grieving yourself. 
  Yeah, well, I just carry on with it. 
  I can't change it, can I? 
  - If you want to talk - No, no, thank you, Vicar. 
  Not into all that bullshit. 
  No offence. 
  Come on, Fred, playground. 
  Yeah, come on. 
  p0rn on your phones. 
  Really? 
  OK. 
  That's great. 
  Thank you. 
  What was your fight with Jim Atwood about? 
  I wouldn't really call it a fight. 
  Oh, that's how it was described to us. 
  What, so you think I had a scrap, and then went and raped Trish Winterman? 
  What was the fight about? 
  Jim likes to tell me when Cath can and can't work. 
  He was accusing me of putting her on shifts that inconvenience him. 
  - And you fought over that? 
  - He winds me up. 
  He has that crappy little garage, which, by the way, is going down the shitter, but he behaves like he's royalty. 
  He was having a little dig, and I'd had enough. 
  So I went over and I offered him out and it all got a bit lairy. 
  But sometimes you have to draw the line. 
  And his wife's 50th was the moment you chose? 
  I know what he thought. 
  I couldn't look after myself. 
  How did the fight end? 
  It was like four punches thrown. 
  That's what I mean. 
  It was barely anything. 
  - And what happened then? 
  - I went home. 
  - How did you get home? 
  - I drove. 
  You weren't drinking? 
  I don't drink. 
  You were sober when you had a fight with Jim Atwood? 
  Yes. 
  Was anyone home when you got back? 
  I live on my own. 
  My wife died 13 years back, before I came here. 
  How long has Trish worked here? 
  Nine years. 
  Longest-standing staff member. 
  I'd be lost without her. 
  She's great. 
  I hope somebody's said to you she won't have done anything to provoke this. 
  She's not that sort of woman. 
  And what sort of woman is that? 
  She's not the sort of woman this happens to. 
  That's what makes it so awful. 
  Did you tell them I had a scrap with Jim? 
  No. 
  - Have you heard from Trish? 
  - No. 
  I was thinking about going over but God, I dunno, I I feel ashamed, you know, responsible. 
  It was my party, wasn't it? 
  How am I supposed to look her in the eye? 
  What happened to you after that fight, Ed? 
  How do you mean? 
  Well, I didn't see you after that. 
  Don't know anyone who did. 
  I was around. 
  Then I went home. 
  Come on, let's get back to work. 
  There's plenty to do. 
  So that camera was in operation on the night of the party? 
  Yes. 
  I've put all the footage on here. 
  It'll show whoever came in or out, this way at least. 
  You weren't here yourself that night? 
  No. 
  I was at home looking after the dogs. 
  My wife was having dinner with friends. 
  How's she doing? 
  The lady. 
  She's being looked after. 
  I'm devastated for her. 
  23 years we've been holding functions here. 
  Nothing like this, ever. 
  When my father was alive, we'd spend the summers here. 
  Down by the waterfall, under the tree. 
  That was my place. 
  I'd sit and no-one would notice me. 
  I don't think we'll rent it out any more. 
  Not after this. 
  An act like this, it sullies everything. 
  It sullies us all. 
  TRISH: It felt more difficult today. 
  Leaving the house. 
  I didn't know if I could. 
  BETH: This won't be a straight line. 
  Some days will feel harder than others for no reason. 
  I keep thinking about that police interview. 
  I didn't get it right. 
  I could see it in their faces. 
  Your only responsibility is to tell the truth. 
  Have you spoken to anyone else about the attack  
  - other than Leah? 
  - No. 
  Do you want to? 
  No. 
  Cath must know by now. 
  The police must've told her. 
  She keeps sending me messages. 
  I keep not replying. 
  Would it be helpful to talk to her? 
  She's a close friend. 
  Yeah, but you know, it was her party. 
  They'd been organising it for so long and And now now she'll always remember it as the time when this happened. 
  Trish, that's not your responsibility. 
  You can't think like that. 
  We blame ourselves when bad things happen and we shouldn't. 
  I know who you are, Beth. 
  I googled you. 
  I'm sorry. 
  Right. 
  That boy who was killed, a few years back, that was your son. 
  You're Danny's mum. 
  Yeah, I am. 
  I am so sorry for what happened to you. 
  Thank you. 
  I don't know how you've coped. 
  Plenty of days I haven't. 
  I promised myself, I promised Danny, that I wouldn't give in. 
  Nothing makes it better. 
  I'm not gonna lie, Trish. 
  This is gonna be hard for you. 
  You're gonna feel so alone. 
  But you need your family and you're gonna need your friends. 
  You can't let him win. 
  We will not let them win. 
  That wasn't so bad. 
  - You OK? 
  - Yeah. 
  It's just cos, you know You don't say much. 
  Just stuff at home. 
  My stepdad's being a dick. 
  More of a dick than normal. 
  Oh, in fact I thought your mum took it off you. 
  Well, yeah, but I took it back. 
  Everything's still on here. 
  Mate, I'm really not that bothered. 
  You haven't seen it. 
  I have. 
  (MOANING) 
  (MOANING INTENSIFIES) 
  Oh, it's good this place. 
  We can have some lunch after. 
  It's not a jolly, Miller. 
  We've this guy, then the musician. 
  - We're behind already. 
  - God, do you live on air? 
  You never eat! 
  No wonder you're so grouchy and thin. 
  Thin and grouchy. 
  Hi. 
  You did the catering for Cath Atwood's party  
  - on Saturday night? 
  - Yeah. 
  It was our first big outside do. 
  Cath comes in here a lot. 
  She asked if we fancied doing the food. 
  And how many people did you take with you? 
  Me and Sami prepared the food, then we had four of our staff take the finger food around. 
  We cooked it all here during the day, then shipped it over to Axehampton, got there around four, started setting up. 
  There was a lot of food. 
  Did you see anything unusual that night, anything out of the ordinary? 
  Any arguments, or conflicts? 
  We did the food, cleared up, came home. 
  Knackered. 
  Had one fag break all night, a ten-minute wander in the garden and that was it. 
  What time was the fag break? 
  Late, er half 11, 12? 
  Where did you walk? 
  Down the lake and back. 
  Did you see anyone else down there? 
  No. 
  We'll need the the names and details of all your team. 
  - No problem. 
  - Just one more thing. 
  Would you mind if we took, er, a DNA swab? 
  We're taking them from everyone who was there. 
  We'll do the same with your staff. 
  It is voluntary. 
  If that's what you need. 
  You guys want anything to eat while you're here? 
  Oh, no, we're fine. 
  We need to get on. 
  Can you have her Friday morning? 
  I've a client appointment. 
  Yeah, no prob. 
  That was easy. 
  I am easy. 
  Aren't I, sweetheart? 
  - Easy old Dad. 
  - (DOORBELL) 
  I'll get it. 
  - What's he up to? 
  - Don't be so suspicious. 
  - Hey, thanks for coming. 
  - That's all right. 
  Go through. 
  - Ben? 
  - Beth! 
  Chloe! 
  Good to see you looking so well. 
  I haven't seen you since court. 
  - How are you getting along? 
  - Sorry, why are you here? 
  You didn't know I was coming? 
  - No. 
  We didn't. 
  - Ah. 
  I've been thinking about next steps. 
  In terms of Dan. 
  - No, Mark, come on. 
  - Listen, just listen - This is not fair. 
  - Ten minutes. 
  That's all. 
  If it's easier, I can come back. 
  Sorry, Ben, this is so embarrassing. 
  - Honestly, no, I can go. 
  - You, stay. 
  Just stay, all right? 
  We know there is no chance of a retrial for Joe Miller. 
  Correct? 
  Not unless any compelling new evidence comes to light. 
  You really gonna make us talk about this? 
  We have never talked about a private prosecution. 
  God, Mark, stop doing this to us! 
  - The answer is no! 
  - At least let's talk about it. 
  Sorry, when you say private prosecution, that's not open to you. 
  The case went all the way to a jury. 
  He was acquitted. 
  Yeah, but what can we do, then? 
  I've read about these cases. 
  Sometimes they go on for years but people do not give up. 
  If what you're trying to do is hold Mr. 
  Miller to account for Danny's death That is exactly what I am doing. 
  you can pursue a civil case against him. 
  It's complex. 
  It is possible. 
  I will warn you, though, these things take a long time to put together. 
  - We're not going anywhere. 
  - Mark! 
  What?! 
  You're busy, are you? 
  You got better things to do? 
  Can we talk about this among ourselves first? 
  As a family. 
  What do you think I'm doing this for, Chlo? 
  I'm doing this for us, as a family. 
  Are you? 
  Cos we don't want it, me and Mum. 
  We're here telling you that and you don't seem to hear us. 
  Also, to process a civil suit, you would need to know Mr. 
  Miller's whereabouts. 
  We'd need an address for him. 
  He moved. 
  We heard he changed his name and no-one knows where he is any more. 
  This is very difficult. 
  It's almost impossible. 
  Right, well, there it is, then. 
  I've never been asked for a DNA swab before. 
  That's quite cool. 
  How did you get the booking? 
  We play the local pubs. 
  Jim asked us after we played at The Anglers. 
  Said he'd seen us a few times, and would we do a special set-list for his wife. 
  Here's our card. 
  It's got our website on the back. 
  - Are you any good? 
  - Yeah. 
  - Why, do you want to book us? 
  - No. 
  What time did you get there to set up at Axehampton House? 
  About five. 
  Well, I was there at five. 
  The other two turned up about quarter past and Beefy wanders in gone half six. 
  Who else was about when you were setting up? 
  Caterers. 
  Cath and Jim. 
  They were arguing. 
  A few bar staff. 
  That was about it. 
  What were Cath and Jim arguing about? 
  Party stuff. 
  Not enough drink, too much food. 
  She said she didn't want live music but he'd booked us anyway. 
  She was fine in the end. 
  I saw her up dancing. 
  What did you do straight after your set finished? 
  Cheeky drink, packed up, went home. 
  Didn't see anything out of the ordinary? 
  That bloke from the farm shop He was in a right old mood. 
  Looked like he wanted to kill someone. 
  Saw him heading off into the gardens. 
  What time was this? 
  Half 11-ish? 
  Seriously, though, please eat. 
  - I'm not hungry. 
  - That's why you're so tired. 
  - I'm not tired. 
  - You look terrible. 
  Just leave me alone, eat your stupid Scotch egg. 
  Why did you come back here? 
  Oh, for God's sake, this again. 
  No, don't do that every time I ask you. 
  Two years I don't hear anything. 
  No texts or emails or calls. 
  - I lost my phone. 
  - No, you didn't. 
  - It had all your details on it. 
  - Bollocks did it! 
  I'm not good at that sort of stuff. 
  What, people? 
  Human relationships? 
  I thought I'd go back home, try and fix the family. 
  Give it another go. 
  It didn't work out so well. 
  The place I thought was home wasn't any more. 
  And then Daisy She, she got herself into trouble. 
  She was at war with her mum. 
  Well, we both were. 
  I just thought, maybe here she'd have another chance. 
  Like I had. 
  - I thought you hated it here. 
  - I do. 
  Mostly. 
  It's not about me. 
  Not many dads would have done that for their daughter. 
  Wouldn't they? 
  It's really got under your skin, this case, hasn't it? 
  I just I can't understand the psychology of the man who does this sort of thing. 
  Don't have to understand him. 
  Just have to nail the b*st*rd. 
  Know what's bothering me? 
  It's not narrowing down. 
  So normally, we'd have been able to rule some of these men out. 
  Feels like the more we talk to, the more we rule in. 
  They were all there, they all saw Trish, they all had an opportunity. 
  It's a scarily wide net right now. 
  - (PHONE RINGS) 
  - Oh, hold that. 
 
 
 
  What? 
  No! 
  Come on! 
  Hello? 
  Yeah? 
  It's the woman from the cab company. 
  Oh, right. 
  (KNOCKS) 
  Hi, again. 
  Can we borrow you at the station? 
  I'm on shift. 
  We've cleared it with your controller. 
  So, you like to be known as Lucas, but your first name is actually Clive. 
  Yeah. 
  I don't think that's illegal, is it? 
  When we spoke, you said that your radio was broken  
  - on Saturday night. 
  - Yep. 
  Trish Winterman, who'd booked a return journey with you,  
  - didn't turn up. 
  - Correct. 
  You called her mobile, no reply. 
  That's right. 
  Did you go looking for her? 
  No. 
  You stayed in the car park at Axehampton, with your light on, you ferried people back and forth. 
  - That's what you told us. 
  - That's what I did. 
  And were any of those people customers like Trish who'd pre-booked? 
  Some. 
  - How many? 
  - Hard to say. 
  Um, I've got a list from your controller - of the pre-bookings. 
  - Right. 
  Have a look through that and tell us which ones you took. 
  For the tape, er, DS Miller is showing Mr. 
  Lucas form EM43. 
  It's difficult, you know. 
  I don't know people's names, just their faces. 
  Do your best. 
  OK. 
  Er (CLEARS THROAT) 
  Tony Bird, I took him, the Symes, I took them, and, er Sam and Sophie Potter. 
  That's probably it. 
  Why are you lying to us, Lucas? 
  Sorry? 
  We called all those people. 
  You didn't take any of them. 
  Did you not think we'd check? 
  Why would you lie about what you were doing on the night a woman was raped? 
  Look, it's daft, but I picked a fare up off the road. 
  - What? 
  - I know we're not supposed to. 
  Legally. 
  I thought you were gonna have a go at me for it. 
  But they flagged me down and it was a good fare, 40 quid. 
  And I never told Ange at the office. 
  I just took the cash. 
  What time was this? 
  Half nine, ten. 
  I dropped off this woman, Sarah, who'd left the party early. 
  I was heading back to Axehampton, turned off the Dorchester road, and that's where he flagged me down. 
  How old was this man? 
  30. 
  Ish. 
  Which direction was he going? 
  Away from Axehampton, towards the turning onto the A35. 
  What sort of mood was he in when he got in the cab? 
  Grateful. 
  What address did you take him to? 
  Top of the hill in Lyme, a street on the right. 
  - He directed me. 
  - But you'd be able to take us back to that street if we asked you? 
  Pretty close. 
  Who's Maria Brady? 
  Did Angela tell you about that? 
  - What's that got to do with it? 
  - Answer the question. 
  Maria was a regular passenger. 
  She made a complaint about me. 
  I misread some signals. 
  What sort of signals? 
  She liked to tell me about her life. 
  I did a couple of airport runs, she'd bring flasks, bit of food. 
  We got on. 
  One drop-off, it was late and I just asked her if she was gonna invite me in. 
  And she looked really scared. 
  It was the wrong thing to do. 
  I knew that straightaway. 
  Are you married, Lucas? 
  Yeah. 
  Trish told us that you two have been out for a drink. 
  A date. 
  You said you only knew her through work. 
  It was once. 
  - Why only once? 
  - We didn't click. 
  She's older, you know. 
  At no point, after you dropped her off on Saturday night, did you see Trish Winterman again? 
  Correct. 
  You sure about that? 
  Yeah. 
  S'pose this is where you tell me off for bringing in Ben, is it? 
  What was that all about today? 
  How many ways do I have to say it before you hear me? 
  - I mean, when's it gonna end? 
  - Justice. 
  For Dan. 
  That's gone. 
  That went the day that jury acquitted Joe Miller. 
  - I'm not gonna accept that. 
  - That's what I mean. 
  No, no, who we are is what we do. 
  That's what you said to me, years back, right? 
  Now, I am Danny's dad. 
  I'm not gonna rest until I know I've done right by him. 
  - That's not on you. 
  - Of course it's on me, Beth! 
  I wasn't there for him. 
  I should've been there for him. 
  You scare me, Mark. 
  I don't know how to reach you any more. 
  It's like there's just you, and what you want and no-one else gets a look in. 
  - That's not true. 
  - Yeah, it is. 
  Our son died. 
  All his potential, everything he could've been, gone. 
  But you still have a family. 
  You have two daughters who are still here, we're still living, and you are wasting what you have and it makes me so angry. 
  - I have to make things right. 
  - For who? 
  Not for me. 
  And do not say Dan. 
  Because he would not want this. 
  How do you know? 
  I still dream of Dan. 
  Do you? 
  No. 
  - How was the cab driver? 
  - What, you mean Clive? 
  Shifty. 
  I've just been speaking on the phone with Alan Tomkins, one of the guests at the party. 
  He used to drive for Budmouth Taxis. 
  He knows Lucas, he knows the cars. 
  He said he saw Lucas' car, empty, locked up, lights out in the car park at midnight. 
  Couldn't see Lucas anywhere. 
  That man is telling us a lot of lies. 
  (PHONE VIBRATES AND RINGS) 
  Oh, sh1t. 
  Trish's phone. 
  New text. 
  Number blocked again. 
  "I'm sorry. " What does that mean? 
  Lindsay? 
  Er, DS Miller, DI Hardy, Wessex Police. 
  Could you spare us two minutes? 
  It's about your husband. 
  Er, he came in to make a voluntary witness statement, erm, in relation to an investigation today and we just want to corroborate a few details, if that's OK? 
  So how long have you been married? 
  16 years. 
  Wow, you got married young, then? 
  Yeah, 19. 
  We fell in love at university. 
  He was going to be a doctor. 
  Right. 
  Is that what he was training for? 
  It was his dream. 
  Still is. 
  What stopped him? 
  I did. 
  We were seeing each other, young love, really besotted. 
  Then I found out I was pregnant from a bloke I had a thing with just before me and Clive got together. 
  But Clive, he said, "If that bloke won't do the honourable thing, I will. " Wow. 
  That's quite a thing. 
  Yeah, he was amazing. 
  He took a study break to earn some money. 
  Said he'd get back to it one day. 
  Hasn't happened like he hoped. 
  Erm, what time did he get in on Saturday night? 
  More like Sunday morning. 
  Past one. 
  He sleeps on that. 
  I have the bed. 
  Well, that must be difficult when he's on late shifts. 
  Not just when he's on late shifts. 
  He sleeps there all the time. 
  Why's that? 
  He cheats. 
  Ten years now he's been cheating. 
  He thinks he's a good liar. 
  But he's not. 
  It's easy to find out. 
  And they never last long. 
  Does he know that you know? 
  Oh, yeah. 
  Every time he apologises. 
  Every time it's the last time. 
  Every time nothing changes. 
  So if you don't mind me asking, why stay together? 
  He looked after me when I made a mistake. 
  And we made a vow. 
  To me, a vow means something. 
  We made our promises in the eyes of God. 
  He wants to break them, that's his mistake. 
  I keep my vows. 
  I can bring up my child. 
  I put all my love into him. 
  I don't need much else. 
  You know what's bothering me about this case? 
  It makes me ashamed to be a man. 
  Oh, mate. 
  I thought, when it was happening, that he was gonna kill me. 
  I just assumed, you know, I thought, he'll finish with me, and then he'll kill me. 
  Jesus. 
  And you've got no idea who it was? 
  No clue at all? 
  How many men were at your party? 
  Too many. 
  How many do you think'd be capable? 
  What, after a few drinks? 
  The police keep asking me, could it have been someone I know? 
  At first I thought, no, not the men I know. 
  Not like that. 
  But now I'm thinking, could it? 
  I'm not so sure. 
  Every man at that party was one of your mates. 
  I know. 
  I know. 
  I don't understand. 
  It just doesn't make sense. 
  Any of it. 
  At a party. 
  Like that. 
  Results are back from the samples of Trish's hair they took at the SARC. 
  They've identified a DNA that's not hers. 
  There's no match to anyone on the database yet. 
  Good. 
  Least we have something to work from. 
  Do you want to come and see this, then? 
  Every man who was at that party. 
  (CLINKING) 
  (SIGHS) 
  Right. 
  Pasta. 
  Again. 
  What's up with you? 
  Promise me you had nothing to do with what happened to Trish. 
  Are you seriously asking me that? 
  You wanna ease off on the red, love. 
  - If you've heard anything  
  - Why would I? 
  Or if you suspect any of your mates  
  - Why's it gotta be my mates? 
  - They were there, weren't they? 
  They're our friends. 
  It's gotta be one of them. 
  You think they told me about it? 
  Cooked it up, ran it by me and I gave it the OK? 
  Haven't answered the question, though, have you. 
  What are you really asking me? 
  Did I rape one of our best friends? 
  I need to answer that, do I? 
  Yeah. 
  No. 
  Why are we meeting here? 
  That stuff you did to the laptop I gave you Can you delete it? 
  Have you got the machine? 
  No. 
  I just thought you could do it remotely? 
  No. 
  That's not how it works. 
  I don't want anyone to find it. 
  Get me the computer, I'll get it removed. 
  (SPORTS COMMENTARY ON TV) 
  - All right, son? 
  - (CHEERING) 
  (TURNS UP VOLUME) 
  Yeah, all right, then. 
  (KNOCKING) 
  - I'll go. 
  - No. 
  - Mum, you don't need to. 
  - I said no. 
  Walk down to the water Stare out across the blue Look to where our love Was stolen I take my leave of you
