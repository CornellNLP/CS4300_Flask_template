 (panting) 
 (groans) 
 Man : On your knees. 
 On your knees. hands behind your head, now! 
 Okay. 
 (grunts) 
 (sighs) 
 It's not working. 
 Russell : It's working. 
 Your circadian rhythm is off, that's all. 
 The human sleep cycle was originally based on the sun. 
 Technology changed all that, so... take a deep breath. 
 You are resetting your internal clock. 
 Ugh. 
 I don't want to reset my circadian rhythm, I just want to sleep. 
 I've been awake for 33 hours straight. 
 I knew you were gonna resist this. 
 That's why I brought my secret weapon, here. 
 What is that? 
 It's, uh, red reishi tea. It's a... it's a natural sedative. 
 It's made from the legendary red reishi mushroom out of east Asia. 
 Is this legal? 
 Yeah, oh, yeah. Yeah. Most states. 
 Relax, will you? 
 It's purely medicinal. 
 Phew! Whew! 
 Smells like goat urine. I'm supposed to drink this? 
 Yeah. Yeah, now, the secret's in the brewing, so let it sit for at least an hour, okay? 
 Then a little cinnamon-- you'll be in heaven. 
 Only 'cause I trust you. 
 Sucker. 
 (both laugh) 
 Avery, D.B.? 
 You need to see this. 
 Social media is out of control, all stemming from a video from Ashdale, Pennsylvania, that's going viral. 
 (glass shattering) 
 Raven : The guy in the video has been missing since July 17. 
 Dispatch : ...and 5th, respond to a three-alarm... 
 On your knees! 
 Hands behind your head, now! 
 Suspect : Okay! 
 Raven : Ashdale PD claims what we're watching is a fabrication. 
 (two gunshots) 
 Raven : It's trending on Twitter, has over a million comments on Facebook and more than four million views on YouTube. 
 But the kicker is, it's only been active 12 hours. 
 Raven, bring up the lower left screen, please. 
 Tensions are high in this small community... 
 Agent Ryan. 
 Well, who could've erased the Ashdale police video system? 
 ...we have received more information on the alleged victim. 
 His name is Derek Noels. 
 Reporter : The 31-year-old unemployed factory worker... 
 Female reporter : ...while community leaders gather, and even though authorities have yet to name the officer involved, there's one question the world clearly wants answered: Where is the body of Derek Noels? 
 Yes. 
 Sounds to me like there was a cyber security... 
 Nelson : What's going on? 
 Ryan : I understand that the police video system was wiped. 
 All right, heads up. 
 The Department of Justice has asked Cyber to investigate a possible intrusion to the Ashdale police department's video system. 
 Russell : Ashdale PD is claiming that an unauthorized user hacked their system, and stole the video and then destroyed the backup files. 
 Mundo : These body cams are being used by cops all across the country to the tune of $263 million in federal funding. 
 If there's a vulnerability, DOJ should know about it. 
 Not to mention a man was shot. 
 Twice. 
 The video itself looks authentic. 
 It definitely came from the Ashdale police video system. 
 Who has admin access to delete those files? 
 The Chief of Police, Allen Richards. 
 He's the only person with authority to delete video. 
 All right, that's where we start, then. 
 Guys, look at this. 
 Social media is off the charts. 
 Hashtag "WhereIsDerekNoels?" has 10 million mentions and climbing. 
 I've never seen this kind of activity. 
 People are angry. 
 They want answers. 
 They want what they always want-- justice. 
 Ryan : Raven, you're here monitoring every second of this. 
 Everyone else, wheels up in ten. 
 Whoever hacked that footage turned this city into a racial time bomb. 
 We have to stop him before it goes off. 
 (shouting) 
 (chanting): Justice knows no death! 
 Where is Derek Noels? 
 Justice knows no death! 
 Where is Derek Noels? 
 Justice knows no death! 
 I will say this, the video tells one story, the officer involved tells another, and they both can't be telling the truth. 
 We can't help unless we have full access to all the information. 
 I've answered every question I can, handed over every camera and computer that we've got... 
 I need to speak with the officer involved. 
 I want a name. 
 That's not gonna happen, Agent Ryan. 
 Department policy. 
 We don't release any information, to anyone, until we complete our internal review. 
 Uh, Chief Richards, look, we-we all want the same thing here, the truth. 
 Do we? 
 Without question. 
 Look, you've seen the crowd. 
 You can understand the time-sensitive nature of our request. 
 All due respect, Mr. Russell, 30 years on the force, not one protest. 
 Now we're one stray brick from being synonymous with Michael Brown and Ferguson or Freddie Gray and Baltimore. 
 So, yes, I understand the nature of your request. 
 An internal review could take weeks. 
 Looks like we're in for a hell of a fight. 
 Looks like. 
 But since we're already into a fight... might as well throw the first punch. 
 Yeah, Raven. 
 Time to find out who the officer is in that video. 
 Crowd (chanting) :  Justice knows no death! 
 ...and this was Derek in high school. 
 He played drums in the band. 
 He wanted to be on the football team, but... 
 When's the last time you saw Derek? 
 Oh, it's been several months. 
 He would come and go. 
 He couldn't find work... it-it was hard. 
 And then my birthday came, and he never missed my birthday. 
 That's when I knew something was wrong. 
 And you filed a missing persons report. 
 Ms. Noels, I'm aware that Derek had a couple of previous arrests for drug possession. 
 Do you know if he was still in that world? 
 You mean, was he a drug dealer? 
 Yes. 
 He used more than he sold. 
 He was no angel, Agent Ryan, but no one deserves this. 
 That's a beautiful necklace. 
 It's a gift from Derek. 
 He always said he would give me the world. 
 (sobbing): No matter how hard I tried, I couldn't save my baby. 
 I just couldn't save my baby. 
 (indistinct chatter) 
 Nelson : Ah! Found it-- a root kit hooked to the system's kernel API. 
 That confirms it. 
 Chief Richards is not our hacker. 
 Someone owned this machine. 
 Nelson :  They watched, they waited, then logged in as Chief Richards... 
 ...and copied the video and wiped the backups without anyone even knowing. All we have to do is figure out who put it there and why. Krummy? Krumitz : Man, look at 'em. Staring at you. 'Cause you're black, they think you're out to get 'em. No, they think  we're  out to get them. We're FBI. And right now, we're the enemy. Right. Hey, between you and me, I understand discrimination. I often get profiled for, you know, being big-boned. Krummy, you did not just equate being big-boned with being black? The bigger the berry, the sweeter the juice. (laughs) You know, I can't talk to you anymore, man. It's true. It's really "the blacker the berry, the sweeter the juice." Pfft. Depends on who you ask. ♪ ♪ I've got the cop camera footage that you sent of every officer in the Ashdale Police Department. That's 89 officers. And the comparison video? The cleanest copy of the Derek Noels shooting footage I could find online. Okay. Let the games begin. Raven : Uh, just one question... I know the players, but what's the game? It's called "find the faceless cop." See, all these officers think they're anonymous when they wear a body-cam, but they're not. Height, weight, musculature, past injuries broken bones... all determine how they run. That translates into biometric markers that give the recorded video a unique shake pattern. It's like the video equivalent  of a fingerprint. Raven : So if the cop who shot Derek Noels is Ashdale PD, we've got him. Ain't science great? ♪ ♪ D.B., it worked. The faceless cop now has a face. And a name: Officer Dean Causley. Ryan : Officer Causley, it says here you have three open IA investigations: two for excessive force and one for shaking down a local drug dealer. All the suspects involved were black, is that correct? Sorry. I have advised my client not to answer that question at this time. Okay. Officer Causley, did you know Derek Noels? Again, I've advised my client not to answer that question at this time. Okay, here's an easy one. How did you dispose of Derek Noels' remains? Come on, Agent Ryan. Tread lightly. We're doing you a favor. There's no proof Officer Causley's even on that video. That's where you're wrong. Ryan : This is a side-by-side comparison. This is your police body cam video from a few weeks ago, this is Derek Noels' video. Your biometric markers are a 91% match to the shooting video. It's junk science. It proves nothing. Just because you don't understand it doesn't mean it's junk. It proves that your client's a liar-- more than likely, a murderer. Watch your mouth. Nelson : Or what? You gonna put a bullet in my back? Nelson. Wait. Officer Causley, I'm going to make you a one-time offer. You take me to Derek's remains and I will make sure the death penalty is off the table. All right, that's it. We're done. We're done here. It was me. I'm the cop in the video. Dean, don't say anything else. Dammit, Stan, shut up! (sighs) Look. I roughed the guy up, all right? I took his stash. It happens all the time. No harm, no foul, no report. But what you saw in that video, that never happened. Nobody died in that alley. Nobody. (sighs) Torrential rain, passage of time. There's no way any trace evidence survived. Yeah, we're not looking for physical evidence. What are we looking for? We are looking for George Mallory's camera. I'm sorry. I-I do this sometimes. Sir Edmund Hillary in 1953 became the first man to conquer Mount Everest, but in fact, the honor of being first to the summit was claimed 29 years earlier by-by George Mallory. D.B., what does George Mallory have to do with what happened here? Well, it's a, it's a lesson in proof. See, Mallory fell down the mountain and died, lost his camera, The film in the camera would've been proof that-that Mallory had been first. This camera should give us the same point of view as the police body cam footage. What do you think? That's exactly where Causley and Noels were that night. So, yeah. Good, yeah. Now do-do your, uh, yeah. Okay. Ready? Ready. Fall down. Bam, bam. Oh, Elijah, look at that. Right? Now watch. Bam, bam. The light off your mag reflected off the hubcap, but in the video, there's no reflection, which means there was no muzzle flash. No muzzle flash, no gunshot. This is proof that Derek Noels was not shot in this alley. This video was tampered with. Yeah. The gunshots were faked. ♪ CSI Cyber 2x03 ♪

Well, we know Causley wouldn't upload a video of himself killing someone. Yeah, which means we are dealing with a very talented black hat. Reporter : About a dozen downtown businesses were boarded up Wednesday and glass littered the sidewalks following two nights of protests over the police shooting of an unarmed black man. There were few people in the streets as police urged curiosity-seekers to stay out of the Over the Rhine neighborhood. Technology stocks... Krumitz, check the BlackPowerForever social media feed. Oh, man. Agent Ryan. Avery, are you still at Officer Causley's house? Nelson and I are finishing collecting evidence, why? Get out. Causley was DOX'd. His name, photo, and address were leaked online. Crowd (chanting) : Where is Derek Noels? Justice knows no death! Krumitz, call dispatch. Have them send APD units out fast. Okay, pack up. We're leaving. His personal information was made public. What are you doing? This is my home. Okay, I'm not leaving without a fight. The last thing you or this situation needs is that gun in your hand. Give it to me! (sighs) Elijah, APD's been dispatched to Causley's house, but they're not gonna make it in time. Connect me to Avery. Get down! Elijah! You're never gonna get out the front door, not with this mob. Change of plans, we're going out the side door. Go, go, go, go, go! (chanting): Where is Derek Noels? Where is Derek Noels? Justice knows no death! Get in the back. Go, go, go. Mundo : Everybody, FBI, back off! Stay back! Hey, back off! Back off now! Everybody, back up. Everyone, back off! Back off! Back off! We're in! Fall back! Stay right where you are. We demand justice! Avery : Heads down! (tires squealing) Well, Causley is officially in protective custody. He's done talking. This guy has multiple accusations of excessive force and bribery on his jacket. The last time Derek Noels was seen alive was on his watch, and  he  needs protection? Sometimes I hate this job. Okay, all right, all right. so the site, BlackPowerForever, claims that they were hacked, that they didn't DOX Causley, right? So the million dollar question is if they didn't, who did? With what we know now, he's profiling as a white male in his 30s, well-educated with a high risk tolerance, and he is dangerously patient. That's interesting. You think our target is white. Wouldn't a black target have more incentive to expose this kind of evil? Yeah, but if he was black, he would feel a sense of pride. And I believe he would find a way to take credit for righting this profound injustice. But this guy, he hasn't taken any credit. He hasn't made any demands. He hasn't issued any statements. He's just sitting back, watching this all happen. Okay, so it's not about a cause or even justice. What does he want? Chaos. But it isn't random. It is controlled, specific. It's personal to him. He wants to light a match and watch this town burn. And like Nero, play his lire while Rome goes up in flames. (chuckles) And like Nero, he'll be close enough to feel the fire. And that's how we'll get him. (chanting): Where is Derek Noels? Reporter : Chief Richards. Chief Richards, any reaction to the reports that the Derek Noels shooting video was tampered with? Julie, you know I can't comment on an ongoing investigation. Can you at least confirm that the cop involved was Officer Dean Causley? (sighs) There you have it. Questions continue to go unanswered as unrest grows, evidenced by this shocking video film by a protester that (clapping) has many asking the question whether or not the FBI... There he is. Welcome back. Hey, great job, man. Glad to have you here. I don't get it. I have checked everything, and I have no idea how Chief Richards' computer got infected. Did you scan the local machine registry? Krumitz :  Twice. All right, did you check the TCP and UDP port traffic? Krumitz :  Backwards and forwards. All right, look, don't worry, Krummy. You'll figure it out. A big-boned friend once said that if necessity is the mother of invention, then perseverance is definitely the father. (chuckles) Thanks, Nelson. I love it when you call me Big Poppa. Oh, that was a good one. That was, wasn't it? Hey, never saw it coming. Never saw it coming. Son of backdoor hack. He hid it. He hid it. Okay, um, I'll let you know what I find. Reporter : Ashdale residents gather around City Hall... Reporter 2 : A country remains divided, a city simmers in the threat of violence.

 Hey, you're back. I solved the riddle. I know how the hacker got into the system. Fantastic. How? Were you at the March on Washington? Yeah. Yeah, I was. My parents felt that it was a moment that we should share as a family. I'm embarrassed to say that all I can remember is it was really ho Hmm, one of the seminal moments of equality in our nation's history, and you were there. Yes, I was. Wow. Huh. Daniel? Yeah? The riddle? Oh, right, right. Our target. He infected the camera's charger with malware, and then snuck it into the precinct. Once he found out what type of body cams they used, he copied the packaging, disguised himself as a delivery man, and dropped off the infected hardware. He was in and out in under a minute. Then, when it was plugged in, it began crawling through the network until it found the chief's computer and took over. See, that's why we didn't see any evidence of suspicious devices. He used one that belonged. So it wasn't tampered with? Not physically, but inside, it's crawling with compromise. Don't plug your charger in unless you know where it's been. I made that up. (chuckles) Genius. Well... (chuckles) I wouldn't say genius. Uh, sneaky, maybe, but not-not-not genius. Anyway, I sandboxed the malware and got the IP address that's phoning home to a Southside community center in Ashdale. Avery, Elijah and a tactical team are en route. (indistinct radio transmissions) (shutter clicking) Dispatcher : Agent Thompson, Agent Thompson, uh, West Commander, uh, Marks will be looking for you on scene... Woman : This is our church! Who would do something like this? Why? (indistinct radio transmission) Thankfully, no one was injured. But everything worth anything was torched. I doubt those devices are gonna yield much. That was his intent-- to destroy all the evidence. Fist he made sure the church was clear. Then he doused the whole place  with exhilarant. He rigged the electrical wiring. So whoever flipped that switch,  would burn this place to the ground. (indistinct radio transmission) You all right? Yeah. I'm all right. (camera clicking) I've never seen anything like it. It's a Proxy Ham. Found it at the fire. Heard rumors about them, but never seen one in action. So our target used this to make us think that the Southside Community Center is where the video was sent and downloaded. Exactly. The fire destroys the evidence and the trail goes cold. But if I can pinpoint the exact frequency, I can track it. Nelson? Are you okay? Everyone's favorite question lately. Difference is I know when you're lying. No. I'm not okay. If I get mad, I'm the angry black man. If I say nothing, I'm an Uncle Tom. I just want to do my job. And come home. I'm sorry. I know words don't always help, but you should know... sometimes it's okay to be angry. Bye. Ryan : Brody Nelson? Please tell me you have a lead. I'll do better than that. It's a homemade relay device that redirected the community center's Wi-Fi over a radio frequency. Tricking us into thinking that the cyber trail died in the fire. (chuckles) That smile tells me it didn't work. Yeah, that's because our target is smart. Think of him like a bank robber, who robs a bank, Heads into the tunnel, cops follow, cars crash-- boom! Tunnel explodes. Everyone thinks it's over. But the target used a secret underground passageway to give the police the slip, escaped unharmed. Boys in blue never knew. Our hacker redirected the video using radio waves knowing that the cops would never even think to look. We're not the cops. We're Cyber. Oh! All we have to do is follow this frequency. Krummy will track him down. Marco. Marco. Marco. Polo. Man : Clear! (Krumitz whoops) This is definitely the right place. All clear! Krumitz : Robert Gaines, Professor of Sociology. Clear! Where the hell are you, Mr. Gaines? Dean, there's a guy here to see you. Said he's got the information you wanted. Says he's a friend. Who is it? Won't say. But he said that Nicole sent him. (chuckles) Yeah, send him in. Well, that's interesting. What is? You see that-- USB drive sitting right there? I bet you cash money that's a kill drive, designed to wipe the entire hard drive if it's removed. So, what's the play? Uh, don't remove it. Just shut the whole system down. Oh, damn it! What? What happened? It was set to wipe no matter what. We're losing everything. Can you image it? I'll let you know in about ten seconds. What are you doing here, Bobby? I wanted to see you. Figured five years was long enough. You're a bad liar. I was hoping with all that's going on, you were ready to make amends. Amends for what? Doing what's right? You hurt me, Dean. Doesn't that mean anything to you? Isn't that worth an apology? You're right. I'm sorry. I'm sorry you're a fool and she's a whore. Why, you ungrateful b*st*rd! Get off me! (both grunting) Get him off! Get off! You're gonna pay for this, Dean! I swear to God, you're gonna pay! Man : Stop it! Russell : What's the verdict? Um, didn't get much. You should have it on screen now. A few files, some photos, his doctoral thesis. The plot thickens. What? What is it? Avery was right. This is personal. Officer Causley and Robert Gaines are brothers. (indistinct chatter) So, all of us blue-eyed kids were seated at the back of the class. We were denied privileges, told that we were stupid, treated like second-class citizens. And all the brown-eyed kids were treated like little geniuses, little gods. The next day the teacher reversed the roles,  and we were sat up front. And we were given all the privileges. And the brown-eyed kids, they were treated like less than. And they were discriminated against by all of us. That's fascinating. It was called "The Blue Eyes, Brown Eyes" experiment. Separating third graders by eye color to teach them the tenets of racism. I mean, that's brilliant. And extremely controversial. But it was powerful. It changed me. Okay, so you're thinking that Gaines is conducting a racially based social experiment. Is that right? It's the only theory that makes sense. Gaines won critical acclaim for a book he wrote-- From Negro to Black: The Forced Assimilation of the African American. So, it's unlikely that Gaines is a racist. His arguments are well reasoned. He claims that knowing the signs of racial discord will help defeat it. Here. In his thesis, Gaines hypothesizes that: "Any city with a black populace of 20% to 50% and an unemployment of 16% or higher is a racial tinderbox." Well, Ashdale's a perfect fit. Just look around. Clearly racism is still rearing its ugly head. But here's the weird thing-- I don't think this is about race. It's about him-- Gaines. He's socially engineering racism to prove his doctoral thesis. Okay, well, if that's true, then he's been planning this for a long time. He might even know something about Derek Noels that we don't. Might've even he killed him. It's possible. Gaines knows this city. And he knows the people of Ashdale cannot take another hit. Which means that's exactly what's gonna happen. Okay, so what's he planning? I don't know what, but I know where. Every news outlet in the country is gonna be at Derek Noels' vigil tonight. That's where he'll strike. So he's ours. We know who he is and where he'll be. All we need is enough eyes to find him. (crowd chanting) As emotions run high, people are now calling for an investigation into this incident. Asking if the FBI went too far in striking a defenseless black protester. Hey, Avery thinks Gaines is gonna be at the vigil. We're setting up surveillance to take him down. Thanks. Do we have a problem? Nah. No problem. When two men have a problem, they talk about it. More often than not, that problem goes away. That would be a great approach if we had a problem. If this is about that takedown, it was a clean takedown. It had nothing to do with race. And there we go. Every time someone says it's not about race, the one thing you can take to the bank is that it's definitely about race. Well, not this time, Nelson. Come on, you were there. You saw it-- a guy came at my head with a baseball bat. It's not about that! Look! E-mails I accessed while looking for the intrusion. You see? Oh, there's more. This is my favorite one right here. Those words didn't come from the racists out there. Those are words from them! Yeah, some of the very cops you cozied up to after your greatest hits performance. Listen, you got to know I would never stand for this. I'm not like that. And most of them aren't, either. They're good people. It only takes a few. This doesn't happen overnight. Robert Gaines might have lit the match, but the gas was poured years ago. Nelson... I'm sorry. I mean, you're right-- this is despicable. But you can't make me accountable for some bigoted cops that I don't even know. Look me in my eye, bro, and tell me you never said it before. In anger, in jest, singing the words to your favorite song, laughing at an inappropriate joke, failing to correct a friend or a family member when they crossed the line. Tell me you're the one. (water runs) (gasps) (chuckles) (laughs) You scared me. Do you love me? Forever. Prove it. I thought I proved it when I married you, but... ...I'll happily do it again. Krumitz : All right, Raven, ready when you are. Ramirez : Give me a sec. I'm linking to the security cam footage outside the Ashdale police station. We'll be able to find Gaines if he's there. All right, facial recognition is up and running. We're also searching the crowd for any signs of Gaines. But these are live feeds, so there's a time delay. Ryan : Copy that. Mundo : All right, you guys are our eyes. It's a mad house down here. (chanting): Where is Derek Noels? Justice knows no death! Where is Derek Noels? Justice knows no death! Where is Derek Noels? Justice knows no death! Okay, I think we've got something. Elijah, 20 yards north, across the street. Blue shirt, black hat. I got him. .. justice knows no death. Where is Derek Noels? Justice knows no death! Where is Derek Noels? Justice knows no death! He made me. I lost him. Ryan : Krummy, talk to me. Uh, okay, okay. Okay, okay, um... There he is, there he is, to your left, Avery. He's right beside you. Ramirez : Elijah, 3:00. .. justice knows no death. Where is Derek Noels? Justice knows no death! Where is Derek Noels? Ryan : Hands up, hands up, don't move. FBI, hands behind your back now! Give me your other hand! Ryan : He wiped his phone. Stand back! Clear! (chanting): Where is Derek Noels? Justice knows no death! Mr. Gaines, I'm Special Agent Avery Ryan. I'm with the FBI. May I please have some water? I have a few questions. You answer them honestly, you'll not only get water, I'll let you speak to your wife, Nicole. How does that sound? You're good. I mean, you set the parameters of what you want, use my wife as a lure to ensure cooperation, even drop her first name to put us on a personal level. It's impressive. Thanks. I read your thesis. I know it's a sick experiment, some twisted social game you're playing, but why? This is no game, Agent Ryan. This is the evolution of social science. I was able to predict with absolute certainty the chain of events which led to-to this moment. Mankind will benefit because of us. And who is "us"? Derek and I. Derek Noels? He's a remarkable human being. Nine months ago, I met Derek on a bus bound for New York. He poured his heart out. He... he shared his pain. And he told me a story about how he was humiliated by a cop. Beaten... but never arrested. Derek was homeless and unable to find a job. He was so broken by the system that he just wanted to disappear. So that's what inspired you to find the video and post it online? That's not Derek in that video. The irony is-- is my brother had several videos to choose from. Destiny chose this one. So where's Derek now? I don't know. Then who's the man in that video? Does it matter? They're all Derek Noels. You're not racist. You're a coward. This isn't about science. This is about vengeance, because you hate your brother. How do you think your wife, Nicole, is gonna feel when she finds out her husband is responsible for all of this? Enjoy reading your thesis in prison. Only after bloodshed is there healing. 9/11, Sandy Hook, the Charleston church shooting. It's the only way. Ryan :  Something is not right. He's extremely calm, much too confident in the face of defeat. He's got another play. Did you get anything off his phone? No, it was wiped clean. (indistinct chatter about phones) Chief Richards, what's going on? I'm on with Causley. The safe house has been compromised. His GPS coordinates are being sent to every phone in the city. His detail is headed back to the precinct. Ryan : This is his play. This is Gaines. He wanted to make sure that his brother was slaughtered tonight. How's he doing this, Nelson? Nelson :  Has to be an auto-dialer. Question is-- how'd he tag him? It's the GPS in the car, it's got to be. Protocol is to sweep the car before it moves. And the GPS is turned off... It's the phones, The phones. I need to talk to Causley. Ryan : Officer Causley, this is Special Agent Ryan with the FBI. Listen to me carefully, I need you and your detail to toss your phones now. You're being tracked. Phones. It's done. Nelson : Didn't work. He's still tagged. The tracker has to be on him, hidden. You two, get a team, bring Causley back. On it.
