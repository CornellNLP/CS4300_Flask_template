 My name is Avery Ryan. I was a victim of cyber crime. Like you, I posted on social media, checked my bank account balance online, even kept the confidential files of my psychological practice on my computer. Then I was hacked, and as a result, one of my patients was murdered. My investigation into her death led me to the FBI, where I joined a team of cyber experts to wage a war against a new breed of criminal hiding on the Deep Web... infiltrating our daily lives in ways we never imagined... faceless... nameless... lurking inside our devices, just a keystroke away.

 (line ringing) 
 You've reached Raven. Leave me a message. 
 Raven, hey, it's me. It's Nelson. 
 I'm sending you a file, but just don't open it. 
 When you get this message, don't worry about calling me back. 
 (grunts) 
 (laughter) 
 Stop, stop, stop. 
 Oh, I know. 
 I will never forget Mom's face when you coughed up that cricket. 
 (laughing): What?! 
 It was huge. I could feel it crawling back up my throat. 
 No. 
 Don't do it, little brother. 
 What? 
 Do not say something mushy and ruin this. 
 I love you, Francine. 
 Ew. Ew. 
 Ugh! (chuckling) 
 (phone chimes) 
 Oh, shoot. I got to go. 
 Do you mind if I put this on my credit card and you just give me cash? 
 'Cause I do not have time to run to an ATM. 
 Where the heck is my wallet? 
 I have so much junk in here. 
 Seriously, I have to clean out my bag. 
 Taylor Pettis? 
 Oh, my God, that's him, isn't it? 
 Wait, Daniel. Wait. What are you...? Why are you going? 
 I want to talk to him. 
 What? No. Why? Just, let's just go. 
 He killed our parents, and I want to talk to him. 
 Daniel, no. Please? 
 I can't believe they let you out. 
 I was hoping for the death penalty. 
 Did you know that? 
 Excuse me. 
 Can I get a to-go container? 
 You don't want to chat? 
 What do you want from me? 
 I came over here to give you a little piece of advice. 
 Don't do anything wrong. 
 For 17 years, I was afraid of you, even when you were locked away, but you know what? 
 Now I'm an FBI agent, and you are just a scumbag criminal. 
 You know what that means? 
 I'm your worst nightmare. 
 You do anything illegal, and I will bust your ass back to prison for life! 
 You can hide, lay low, move away, and I will still come after you. 
 (sighs) 
 Ryan :  Listen up, we got a new case. 
 Tabloid gossip amplified. Each one of these people woke up this morning the victim of a hack. Recordings of personal conversations they had were leaked online. All right, I got a congressman, a CEO, an accountant. Krumitz : And a grocery store clerk? Mundo : It doesn't add up. There's no apparent connection between any of these victims. Well, this is a specific and unusual hack. No e-mails, no personal photos. Just audio files. And none of the victims' devices collected revealed any evidence of an intrusion. Krumitz, I want you to run a waveform analysis on those audio files. Where, when, how were they recorded? There's got to be a connection. Nelson? Where's Nelson? Sorry. I... I thought I mentioned this. Nelson called. He fell asleep on the metro and missed his stop, so he should be here... any minute now? Daniel, I'll help you with the audio files. Ryan : Our target has an agenda. We need to know what that is so we can find them. Woman : It's easy to steal from them. It started with me taking a few dollars from the register every shift. Man : I sometimes imagine killing him. I'm afraid I'll really do it someday. Man 2 : I feel so guilty every time I look into my wife's eyes and tell her I was working late when really I was with another woman. Woman 2 : He was 15. I was his math teacher. I never intended to have s*x with him. It just happened. Sounds like a confession. Bring down the volume on the main track and pull up the room tone. (water flowing) Is that the sound of water? Krumitz : Yep. It's the only sound all the audio files have in common. So, they were all recorded in the same place. There's hesitation, moments of defensiveness, and ultimately, relief. These aren't confessions. They're sessions. They're therapy sessions. Our victims' confidential files were hacked. And they all have the same therapist. I'm gonna make a call, get an address. Elijah, Krumitz, you're with me. Let's go. Uh, I don't know what Nelson's up to or what you know about where he is, but I think it would be a very good idea if he were here when we got back. Me, too. Yeah. (sighs heavily) You've reached Brody Nelson. Leave me a message. Nelson, it's me  again. I'm officially worried. Call me. Screw it. There you are, Nelson. Agent Ryan, those nine victims were all patients of a Dr. Richard Chan. 350 Mass Avenue Northeast. Ryan :  Thank you. The door's ajar. Ryan : There's our sound of water. There was a struggle. (camera shutter clicking) Ramirez : Nelson! I'm over here! Come on! Cut me loose. I'm tied up. Come on! What happened? Are you okay? Did you get the file I sent? Yes, I got the file. What are you up to, Nelson? Did you get in a fight or something? (panting) It's gone! Everything is... is gone. What are you talking about?! You sure you got the file I sent? Yes, I have the file you sent me. I have it right here. Okay, good. But, Nelson, there is FBI protocol that we need to follow. They take this stuff seriously. If this isn't for a case, you could go to jail, and I could, too, because you've made me an accomplice. All right. So, I'm gonna ask you again, what is going on? Look, I can't tell you, all right? I have to speak to Avery. Unbelievable. It was a match. The print lifted from that hourglass we collected at Dr. Chan's office. Did you get a name in AFIS? Actually, was an FBI database, a reference print. It was mine. You don't seem surprised. That hourglass caught my eye. I had the same one on my desk when I was a psychologist-- until it went missing. Avery, that was a long time ago. You don't think it was the same one? But you can't argue with evidence. My print was on that glass, even though I didn't touch anything at the crime scene, so either it's the same one, or someone went to a lot of trouble to plant my print. Sifter : I get the feeling you know something more than what you're telling us. I don't know what I know, Simon. Avery, four more recordings were released online. Someone's also leaked the details of Dr. Chan's murder investigation. More importantly, your personal involvement could compromise this investigation. So, at the very least, tell me what you think you know. Avery, I need to talk to you. Nelson, you're hurt. What's happened? I'm fine. It's-it's not important. Can we talk? Alone? Excuse me. All right. Where have you been? What is going on? I need your cell phone. Why? It's important. Is your personal laptop here? No, I left it at home. Why? Someone is spying on you. How do you know that? Because  I  was spying on you. My first week here, I remember you told me that your psychology practice was hacked, and how you hadn't found the guy. Well, it stuck with me. I was a behavioral psychologist. I had a practice in New York. And then, one day, all my patients' files were stolen from my computer, and all their secrets went public. You tried to find my hacker? I was trying to solve the unsolvable case. I saw it as a challenge, so I went digging on the Deep Web. Nelson, you broke the conditions of your parole. Look, I know. I figured whoever hacked you had to keep the files he stole somewhere. Just not on a personal device, but the safest place. Are you telling me... you found my files? Yes. But the hacker has new information about you. Current documents, photos. Even has recordings of your phone conversations. That's not possible. The FBI runs vulnerability testing quarterly. Last month, they scanned all my devices. They're clean. I know. Which is why I didn't come to you right away. I wanted to confirm it. And I did. Last night. I found the RAT. On your home laptop attached to a personal video file. I downloaded the malicious code. I have it right here. Come on. Ah, perfect timing. I just I.D.'d the Remote Access Trojan on Dr. Chan's computer. It gave our hacker complete control of the device. He had access to the doctor's files and could remotely turn the computer's microphone on and off. I couldn't identify the RAT at the scene because it was an unknown exploit. My guess is it was created by an old-school hacker. Even today, it's pretty impressive work. Hey, what's going on? This is it. Dude, what happened to you? Why are you bleeding? And where the hell did you find that code? That's it. That's the code I just found on Chan's computer. That's how our target was able  to open up the microphone on Dr. Chan's computer and listen in. Woman :  My husband will divorce me. Man :  I sometimes imagine killing him. I'm afraid I'll really do it someday. Krumitz :  Then our target must have recorded the sessions on his own device. Nelson just discovered it on my laptop. Wait, what? Yeah, it's been there for a while. It means whoever hacked Dr. Chan is the same black hat who hacked me all those years ago. He's back. ♪ CSI Cyber 1x13 ♪

♪ Oh, yeah. ♪ Ryan :  All my patients' files were stolen from my computer and all their secrets made public. Nelson :  So did you catch him? The hacker? Ryan :  Still don't even know who he is. Mundo : Avery. Our target's trying to get my attention. Wait, exposing secrets and embarrassing people is a way to get your attention? You have no personal connection to any of the victims. You have a personal connection to the target. It's a reminder of... New York when he stole all my patient files. So why now? Why not three months from now? Because Nelson stirred the monster. And he thought Nelson was you. He thought you'd discovered him, and he got scared. Yeah, but it didn't scare him. It thrilled him. This is part of his endgame. Nelson didn't just find my old patient files. He discovered I'm being watched and I have been since the day my practice was hacked. What? I was always my hacker's intended victim. So your fingerprint on that hourglass at Dr. Chan's murder scene, that was his message, his way of guaranteeing you'd be involved. Our target has been lying in wait preparing for this day. All right. That's every computer I owned since I was first hacked. So this is your place, huh? Nice. Homey. Well, what did you expect? Oh, I don't know. A drum set, velvet Elvis, pet alligator. Well, he's at the vet. Any-who, um, I brought you a present. Couldn't leave you without a computer or a phone, so... FBI laptop. Clean as a whistle. Connected to our network. And... burner cell. With all your contacts already uploaded. Thanks, Krummy. If you want, I could stay. Aw. Or  not, That's weird, okay. Anyway, um, so your-your security detail is, uh, parked outside just in case you need anything. And, uh, I will see you in the morning, boss. (chuckles) (chuckling): Oh. Thank you, Daniel. So... every time Avery got a new computer,  she transferred the video file with the embedded RAT. With every transfer, she was basically RAT'ing herself. Ramirez : When she clicked on the infected video file on her new computer, the hacker had complete control. So to find the hacker, we need to find the legacy device. The very first computer the hacker infected with the RAT. The one he actually touched. The only one that can lead us to him. Our digital patient zero. Sounds great, but it's not here. But we do have Dr. Chan's laptop. Which was infected directly by the hacker. That's where we'll start. Aw, you're so smart. (scoffs) Don't even try it. What? I'm still mad at you. Sifter. What? What about Daniel Krumitz? Is everything okay? No, it is not. Taylor Pettis filed a report with Metro PD. Claims you threatened him. (sighs) You know, Daniel, this is serious. Your badge doesn't give you authority to break the law. I didn't break the law. I had a conversation. And unless you're gonna suspend me or assign me to desk duty and put me on probation, I don't really want to talk about it. Hey. Sit down. We're not done yet. My friend, you are trapped in ice. When a traumatic event happens to us at a certain age, we tend to always relate to it like we're still that same age. Okay, so I'll just grow up. You see, right there, that was the frustrated, scared response of a ten-year-old. I watched my best friend burn to death. In college, we were driving back to campus after Thanksgiving break. A truck driver fell asleep at the wheel, slammed right into us. Brian whispered his last words into my ear. Since then, every whisper I hear, somebody leans forward to share a confidence with me, I don't even hear the words. Just his whisper. "Don't let me die." You're never gonna get rid of the loss, but you have got to get past this anger. Because that... ten-year-old kid who lost his parents is now a 28-year-old man. (sighs) (alarm beeping) Krumitz, what's going on? I don't know. It's happening in Tear Down, too. Excuse me. One of our computers was infected with a malicious code. Cyber's been hacked? Looks like the same RAT we found on Dr. Chan and Avery's computers. Ryan : All right, you want to play games? Let's play. (crying softly) Mundo : How did this happen? Did we infect ourselves? Krumitz : No. It looks like Avery infected herself. I thought you took all her devices. I gave her an FBI laptop. But she needed the video file on the flash drive. Wait a minute. It's gone. What? The flash drive. I-I put it right here. She doesn't want us to know what she's doing. I know you hacked my computer. I know you're watching me. You have my attention. What do you want now? 
 
 (alarm continues beeping) (groans) (vibrating) Come on. Pick up, pick up. Man (over speaker) : Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. The 5:30 departure for Richmond is now boarding. (beeping) (phone chiming) It's glued down. Smart. (phone chimes) Mundo :  Krumitz worked through the night eradicating the virus from CTOC. Sifter :  That's great, but  our target's just released information on three more of Dr. Chan's patients. Any word from Avery? No. And we can't track her. Avery's gone dark. What do you think? I think this is personal. I think Avery went after her hacker. We got something off of Dr. Chan's laptop. The hacker was clever. He was hopping his I.P. address. We finally found the network the RAT was using to communicate with. We also got a physical address on him as well. We know exactly where our hacker is. Don't shoot, don't shoot, don't shoot, don't shoot. Hands up. On the floor. On the floor now. Okay. I'm down, I'm down. Clear. (grunts) What is this about? SWAT officer : Clear. Ow. What is this about? Where's Avery? Avery? Where is she?! Avery Ryan? Wh... Aah! Your code was old-school, Andrew. It was tough to break, but we got you. So one more time. Aah! Where is she? I don't know what's happened, but I swear to you I haven't seen my ex-wife in years. What'd you say? I last saw Avery four years ago in New York. I haven't seen my ex-wife since then. (clang, whoosh) Not bad. You worked hard to set all this up. I'm almost impressed. Well, you have a pretty impressive eye for detail. You were one of my patients. (laughs) Oh. You stole this. Mmm. And my hourglass and my patient files. You ruined my practice. My only question is why. You went to all this trouble to re-create my office to get me to come here, so where are you? Man : You failed. You failed all your patients. You knew Avery was married, and you never said anything? I don't share Avery's background with anyone. Or yours, for that matter. Will somebody please tell me what's going on here? We are trying to find Avery, sir. That's why your people are searching my house and snooping through my computer? All we know is that somebody's computer got hacked in just the same way that your ex-wife's got hacked ten years ago. And our investigation, sir, has led us right to you. Well, let me assure you that I would never do anything to hurt Avery. Mundo : Divorce is tough. I've been there. Resentment builds. Anger. Sounds like you have a lot of issues. None of which I can relate to. What came between Avery and I... Do I need a lawyer? Tell me, how did I fail you? You were quite fond of your other patients. My other patients. But not you? No. We were close. Close. You felt we had something more. We had something special. Well, something must have happened in our relationship. You hacked my computer and stole my files. Demonstrating how powerful you were. How powerful I am. (chuckles) Of course. Well, if you brought me here for a session, maybe we should start with your delusional fantasies and your obsessive behavior. Dr. Ryan, you've been after me for a very long time. It keeps you up at night. You came here today looking for answers, despite the possible danger. So you tell me, who's delusional and obsessive? His computer's squeaky clean. He didn't hack Dr. Chan or Avery. All right, well, someone's working awfully hard to put hubby in our crosshairs. Sifter : I know it was a while ago, but is there anything in particular you recall about that time that Avery's files were hacked? Well, we were divorced by then. Next time we spoke, she dropped by here, told me she was moving to D.C., asked me to hold on to some of her old office stuff until she sent for it. Which she never did. Office stuff? Yeah, books, pictures, files, an old computer-- stuff. I was hoping we'd be able to speak in person. I prefer to speak this way. There are 77 files on the screen, displaying each patient's last name. I had 78 patients. You're conspicuous by your absence. I should've known it was you when I walked into an abandoned steel factory. Your abusive father was a steelworker. You told me what he did to you. It's because of him you have such severe social anxiety. It's what keeps you on that side of the screen... Logan. Logan Reeves. (door squeaks open) Why don't you have a seat, Logan, so we can get started? I'll stand. Whatever makes you most comfortable. Let's talk about how you're feeling. Clearly you're still angry with your father, which is why you chose this place for our session. This is not about him. What is it about, then? You promised me that you'd always be there. That you'd help. Well, I'm sorry you feel that I failed you. You need to understand I could no longer help you. You abandoned me. You pushed me off onto another doctor who forced me into taking medications that only made things worse. Logan, you suffer from a delusional disorder. You needed further treatment which I could not provide. That's not true. I read your notes. (scoffs) "Patient responding to treatment." Responding. I was improving. That was before I understood your attachment to me was hindering your progress. You were the only person that could ever help me. Well, I'm here now. Let's talk. Here's the laptop Avery's ex-husband gave us. The legacy device. The RAT's been on this computer for years. Avery had no way of knowing. But the hacker had to leave digital fingerprints. Krummy, pull up the event log with all the connected devices. That computer connected to a couple dozen external devices throughout its life. Krumitz : Yeah, we're looking for the outlier. Uh... Nelson : There. The devices on this list have connected multiple times, except for that thumb drive. Ramirez : Only plugged in once. Nelson : That's our RAT. It's got to be. How did the hacker gain access to Avery's laptop in the first place? Good question. The transfer occurred on a Wednesday at 2:34 p.m. Business hours. A patient. Okay, we've got Avery's old address book on here. On that date and time... Uh, she was in a session. With Logan Reeves. Mm-hmm. "Patient exhibits paranoid and delusional tendencies. Anxiety. Anger. Potential early onset psychotic disorder. Not a danger to himself or others at this time." That's reassuring. Not so fast. According to the FBI database, over the last decade, Logan Reeves has been arrested multiple times. All violent charges. Avery :  Tell me about when you first  started hacking. As I recall, you didn't even like computers. Mmm. (softly laughs) I liked you. I became a proficient hacker to get to know you better. I... felt like you knew everything about me. I knew nothing about you. It was a very one-sided relationship. Mmm. Well, that's what therapy is. I was your doctor, not your friend. For someone who claims to be so perceptive, you clearly don't understand what this is all about. Then tell me. It's not about you fixing me, okay? See, you... had your chance to help me. But you gave up! You gave up on me! We need a lock on this guy ASAP. Last knowns. Current aliases. Preferred substances. I want to know everything there is about Logan Reeves. I got Logan's last known address. Saratoga Springs. Mental institution. Unfortunately, it closed down a little over a year ago. And the patients? Back out on the street. No follow-ups. No clue. You've got to be kidding me. There has to be something else we can do. Avery, where are you? (heavy door sliding open) Danielle. You remember her? My former patient? Mm-hmm, the one that you didn't give up on. The one that you devoted so much time to. The one that you chose to help when you didn't want to help me. For that reason, she had to die. Oh, you were so convinced that her abusive ex-husband killed her, you even testified against him. You helped convict an innocent man, and now he is rotting in jail. You killed Danielle. It's so much harder than you would think to strangle a person. People find strength when they're facing death, hmm? But Dr. Chan-- ooh. He put up much more of a fight than your little friend, Danielle. What? No response? (laughs) You act like you are so... emotionless, but I know the truth. Yeah, yeah, I knew that you would transfer that video to all of your devices because of its sentimental value. Your emotions are the reason that I've been able to watch you all these years. Do you understand what you've done, Logan? (panting) Do you? Hmm? Hmm? I did this for you, for us. (Ryan coughs) This is where we began, and this is where we're going to end. (inhales loudly through his nose) (exhales though mouth) It's carbon monoxide poisoning. (laughing): I bet that you thought that you have to be in, like, oh, a small, enclosed space, like a... a car, right, for it to kill you. Uh-uh. Uh-uh. No, it just takes a little bit in the air, and you're dead. You think, because you outweigh me, it ensures that I'll die before you? But what if I don't? (grunting) (coughing) (phone ringing) This is Elijah Mundo. Ryan (exhales) : It's me. It's Avery. Four eight two six... Riverside Drive. It's carbon... A-Avery? Avery? It's got a keypad entry. Elijah, Elijah, we got this. Got it? One more second. We're good. Okay, we're in. Now, now, go! Okay, guys, move out. Avery? Can you hear me? Avery, can you hear me? Avery! Avery? (groaning) We were worried about you for a moment there. Huh. Oh, my head is splitting. (sirens blaring) How long was I out for? Just a few minutes. Logan, did we get him? Sifter : No. You got him, Avery. It's over now. (siren blaring) Man (over radio) : Attention all units in the vicinity of J Street. Officers requesting backup and a bus. Call came in an hour ago. Shots fired. Unis are canvassing the area for witnesses. Can you confirm an I.D. on the Vic? Taylor Pettis. Wallet and license were in his pocket. Still had 200 bucks on him. Not a robbery. No. No, someone came here to kill him. (camera shutter clicking) (door opening) Andrew :  Hi. Come on in, please. What a surprise. I... You didn't have to come all the way out here to check up on me. Well, no. I-I wanted to... tell you I was sorry in person. I-I know my team roughed you up, and... I just never talk about my past, so they didn't know who you are. I... I'm glad you're safe, Avery. Thanks. You are okay? You're not hurt? Yeah, I'm okay. Just part of the job. (laughs) My girl-- still so tough. It's finally over, though. I mean, this guy was the one who hacked your practice? Yes. His name was Logan Reeves. He knew that I would always cherish... (groans softly) ...the videos of the two of us with Hannah, that I'd always keep them with me. He embedded a RAT in one particular video file. Basically, it allowed him to live inside my computer. It was the video of us with Hannah in the park. The last time all three of us were together. Can I see it? The video? Do... do you have it? (sighs) Oh, wow. (sighs) (laughs) Oh... (laughs) (laughs) (laughs) Oh. (laughs) Oh. You know... I remember this whole day. Her chasing those bubbles and... and that duck that took her whole piece of bread, and she followed him into the water, and-and... and watching her eyes watch the sunset, and... This was a perfect day. An hour doesn't goes by where I don't think about her. (voice breaking): Where I don't miss her. Losing Hannah was the worst thing I've ever gone through. Right up there with losing you. I am so sorry it tore us apart. I am so sorry. (sighs, sniffles) Oh, me, too, Andrew. Me, too. Oh, me, too, Andrew. (rolling thunder) (sighs) Francine, what's going on? What happened? (crying) I killed him. Uh... I did it, Daniel. (crying) I killed Taylor Pettis.
