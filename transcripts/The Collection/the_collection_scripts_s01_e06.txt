 We've all done things we regret. 
 Some of us more than others. 
 Aren't you curious what this guy was up to three years ago? 
 Rossi : It's a Bruchner. What have you gotta do to get a gift like that? 
 Billy : You left a book in your room. There was a note inside. 
 Rossi was right! What was he doing during the war? 
 Get a shot of your friend? 
 Dominique? That's not a story, that's a poem. 
 Where is my bag? It was hanging on the back of this chair! 
 Where's the film? 
 He was only just adopted. 
 It might be easier for you to get him back if you had the father's support. 
 It's Claude. 
 You can't possibly hate yourself that much. 
 I need a place to live. 
 I'll ask around. 
 Fortier. Why do I know that name? Didn't I meet her last night? 
 My mother killed that sailor. 
 Does Claude know? 
 No. Promise me he'll never know. 
 Helen : You know, it's never sat right with me, this arrangement between you? 
 Scissors! 
 Maybe it's worked because you and your brother are driven by completely different impulses.

 (KNOCKING) 
 (VOICES BEHIND DOOR) 
 Try whatever you like. 
 I asked my father to describe every last one in detail. 
 Oh, that's heaven! 
 Was this part of the new collection? 
 Everything you see here. 
 I can't believe I missed this! 
 I begged my father. If I sneeze, he assumes it's pneumonia. 
 He practically locked me in my room. 
 Madame Sabine, I didn't know you were here. 
 No, I didn't know you were here either. 
 It's so late. 
 There's still work to be done. 
 Not enough hours in the day. 
 Hello. 
 This is Cecile, Monsieur Trouvier's daughter. 
 I ran into her at the Richelieu where she's staying with her father. 
 And I forced Madame Sabine to sneak me in. It's my fault. 
 I'm desperate to wear something from the new collection this weekend. 
 Is there a special occasion? 
 Monsieur Trouvier is hosting a gathering at his château to celebrate our success. 
 Oh, yes. I think I heard about that. 
 We must find you something special. 
 Let's see. 
 Oh, I love this! 
 Oh, yes, that one is lovely. 
 Oh, this is beautiful. 
 Would this fit me? 
 Is my husband upstairs? 
 Possibly. He doesn't usually leave without saying good night. 
 Cecile, you're in good hands. 
 (CECILE GASPS) 
 It would look fantastic. 
 This one I love. 
 Knock-knock. 
 How was dinner? 
 Wet. They just wanted to drink. 
 I ran into Jules Trouvier and his daughter on the way out. 
 I didn't know they were still in Paris. 
 Oh, yes. She's downstairs. 
 They're not leaving until Cecile has at least six costume changes for the weekend. 
 (HE LAUGHS) 
 Do you expect to be here much longer? 
 Hope not. 
 The magazine sent over proofs and overheated copy. 
 There aren't enough hours in the day. 
 Yes, Charlotte mentioned that. 
 Are they gonna use this? 
 Eliette wants it for the last page of the spread. 
 Any chance they could take it again? Maybe squeeze Claude into it. 
 I don't think Eliette's eager to squeeze Claude into anything except a pulp. 
 There'll be other pictures. 
 You keep working. I'll drop Cecile and I'll see you at home. 
 Mm-hm. 
 What were you talking to Claude about the other night? 
 When you were both at the bar? 
 What are you asking me? 
 Why did he want to be there? 
 Do you have something to do with his sudden appetite for visibility? 
 Your brother trusts me, Paul, and I'm sorry that you see that as a threat. 
 I don't. I appreciate your help. 
 Just wanna make sure we all have our eyes on the same prize. 
 (MELLOW JAZZ IN BACKGROUND) 
 Are you hungry? 
 Always. 
 Do you think your brother has a clue about us? 
 I don't think my brother's thinking about me at all. 
 What's this? 
 Hospitality. 
 I don't serve meals, so... 
 I'm flattered. 
 You should be. They're still black market round here. 
 They're a gift, actually, from some baroness. 
 She's got groves of them somewhere. Marbella. 
 Mesopotamia. Somewhere with an M. 
 Why is she sending you gifts? 
 We sold her a gown that makes her look taller than my cat. 
 Must be nice. 
 Not really. 
 The gifts aren't addressed to me, they're addressed to my brother. 
 "Oh, monsieur. You must come visit us. You must come see our little castle." 
 "Please. Come see our zoo." 
 Does she have one? 
 Don't they all? 
 You should go. 
 No, thanks. 
 I'm racing at the end of the month. 
 You should come. 
 f*ck you. 
 It'll be fun. 
 Oh! 
 Private estate. 
 Filled with lovely ladies who'll be decked out in finery from your shop. 
 You must have me mistaken for someone who likes people like you. 
 Come on. Be my cheering section. 
 Don't you wanna see me take a hairpin turn on two wheels? 
 I thought I already had. 
 Weren't you with a lovely lady when we met? 
 Your jaw must be tired. 
 Is that another invitation? 
 I was referring to that nasty habit you have. Snapping the hand that feeds you. 
 I feed myself. 
 Such a waste of energy. 
 All they wanna do is pet you. 
 You should go. 
 I have to get up early in the morning. 
 Victor : She was here? In your office? 
 Not by my invitation. 
 Do you want me to ask her? 
 Dominique may not have left that there herself. 
 She's smarter than that. 
 Now, this... was delivered to Rossi... the American reporter who went after the Mayor. 
 Who do you think would write such a thing? 
 I don't know. 
 It could very well be the work of someone in this building. 
 Many of the workers will be here over the weekend catching up on orders. 
 Don't waste the opportunity. 
 But I would start with her. 
 All of them? 
 The daughter wants to see everything. 
 But this one isn't even my size. Who will model? 
 Flor called in sick. 
 There's a rumour that she's on a Scandinavian holiday... with the Norwegian prince who came to see the show. 
 A real prince? 
 I don't think his title even matters. 
 All Flor's looking for is a husband who can give her a sweet house in the country and lots of babies. 
 I'm betting you'll meet a few princes yourself this weekend. 
 I'm not going. 
 Why? Monsieur Trouvier invited you himself. 
 I can't spend a whole weekend posing, strangers asking me where did I go to school. 
 Where are my people from? 
 Who cares? 
 Make it up as you go along. 
 Flor just went away with him? A man she barely knows. 
 I'm guessing they'll know each other pretty well after she sits on his throne. 
 Ah. So you are in here. 
 What do you want? 
 I may have found you a place. 
 You mentioned your living situation. 
 It's better now. Thank you. 
 I think I'll... model... this one first. 
 The film wasn't in the bag and I don't know what I'm supposed to tell him. 
 You tell him that some of the film was defective and you sent the negatives to a lab. 
 I can't... I can't keep apologising. 
 You're not apologising. You're buying time. 
 I'll speak to my friend at the American Embassy. 
 We'll find out more about this man following your buddy. 
 He's not my buddy. He's just a guy from back home. 
 Just because we laugh at the same jokes and miss hot dogs, doesn't mean I'm writing fan letters to Stalin. 
 Billy, whoever took your camera bag might still have these negatives. 
 And they can't mean much to him. 
 What if he just took my negatives and threw 'em in the Seine? 
 Then he has no taste. 
 Which is a crime much worse than yours. 
 I just feel like every time I turn around here, I step into another pile... 
 You do. 
 But it's because you've been doing a lot of walking. 
 You don't be ashamed of your ambition, Billy. 
 It's what my husband likes about you. 
 You're the only one who has as much as he does. 
 You won't tell him I told you this? 
 Why would I? 
 Have you eaten since yesterday? 
 What was yesterday? 
 Come on. 
 (WOMAN SINGING IN FRENCH) 
 God, I love that colour! 
 Should I get that one too? 
 It's only a weekend. You can't wear them two at a time. 
 There'll be other weekends, Papa. 
 And weekdays. I'd wear that on a Tuesday. 
 Cecile, be sensible. Would you really feel comfortable in that? 
 Wouldn't you prefer something more modest? 
 You means sleeves? Just say it. Something that covers my fat arms. 
 There's nothing wrong with your arms. I'm just saying choose wisely. 
 Monsieur designs in many different styles. 
 Maybe there's something else you would like. 
 This, for example. Hmm? 
 Actually, monsieur, this can be worn with a silk shrug. 
 Oh, but you don't need it. 
 The dress would be just as flattering on you without it. 
 Maybe in a darker colour. 
 But this is a colour you love. 
 On you. 
 I wasn't sure at first. 
 It took some time to get used to. It's true. 
 I only own three dresses. Light, medium and dark brown. 
 Papa? May I? Please? 
 Nina, wait! If I wear that, what are you going to wear? 
 Oh, er, unfortunately Nina can't join us for the weekend. 
 What? Why? 
 I thought you said that there would be guests that I could talk with. 
 There are. The Marquise de Lithière. 
 Papa, the Marquise doesn't talk to me. She just corrects my grammar. 
 There's one more dress. Excuse me. 
 You ask me to be a hostess. Why can't I dress like one? 
 Who's that? 
 Are you looking for Marianne? 
 She had a doctor's appointment. 
 Who'll be supervising over the weekend? 
 We won't fall behind. I'll be here. 
 Glad to hear that. Who else? 
 Clarice, Genevieve, Martine. 
 What about Dominique? Does she have any fittings? 
 She does. Why? 
 Will you be managing the place while Monsieur's out of town? 
 Did you have something to do with this German fountain pen he found? 
 What was that detective talking about? Was it yours? 
 You don't need answers. Just say thank you. 
 How can I thank you when I don't know why this detective went away? 
 You can't suddenly treat me like a passenger on this train. 
 What? 
 What, am I supposed to knock first? 
 Trouvier's in the building. 
 We could have been in a meeting. 
 You could have been. 
 But you weren't. Where did that come from? 
 Do you like it? 
 Does it matter? 
 It's borrowed. 
 I've put down a deposit. 
 What are you eating? 
 Whatever she can. 
 Take one. Use your back teeth, they're a little stale. 
 Erm, is there a reason that Victor just asked me if I was working over the weekend? 
 I've asked some of the girls to put in extra hours. We're behind. 
 You're welcome to be here, of course, unless you get a better invitation. 
 Mm. I just did. 
 From the silent partner's not so silent daughter. 
 What did you say? 
 Well, I said that I would check my calendar. 
 But I'm beginning to think that I might be available. 
 It's an intimate gathering of potential clients, Claude. 
 Really? Will there be more pictures you don't want me to be in? 
 Claude. 
 It's not your crowd. You'd be bored. 
 Mm. You see, I think it might be useful... me to see all your clients shed their clothes... jump into the swimming hole. 
 Be far easier for me to design for them once I've seen all their lumps and bumps. 
 Oh, Maman. Slow down. 
 You don't have any back teeth. (CHUCKLES) 
 He's testing you. 
 Let him. But not in public. 
 If you shove, he'll shove back. 
 I can't have him wandering around that château, worrying if he's gonna detonate. 
 Oh, Paul! 
 He pissed on Eliette Malet in front of a room full of reporters. 
 We can't make enemies of the people we need as friends. 
 If you get him uninvited-- 
 I'll speak to Trouvier. 
 That guest list just expanded to include you as well. 
 Me? 
 This weekend? I'm not sure I'm available. 
 You'll be there. Keeping him on a leash. 
 If he strays, you both go home. 
 And you're to steer clear of Helen. You hear me? 
 Why? Is She contagious? 
 If you want a seat on this train, you can pay for the ticket. 
 You're going now? What changed your mind? 
 Cecile wants me to be there. 
 Besides, there aren't that many princes left in Paris. 
 (MAN SINGING IN FRENCH) 
 It seems Cecile did find something to wear. 
 Ah, yes. The atelier has found its most devoted client. 
 Unfortunately, she's not paying retail. 
 Madame Sabine, you were right. They found three dresses that fit me. 
 This young lady's going to need a whole new closet. 
 Yes, I've you to blame for this. 
 Bringing her here when she should have been in bed. 
 Although if her mother was still alive, she'd probably have done the same thing. 
 I'm glad I could be there for her. 
 Cecile. 
 A little gift. Gloves to go with that gorgeous brocade. 
 Oh, Charlotte, you read my mind. 
 What else am I thinking? 
 A hat? 
 A weekend away for you. 
 If we're celebrating the maison, you deserve to be there too! Doesn't she? 
 I couldn't possibly-- 
 If you're not, I'll wear the wrong gloves with the wrong brocade. Please! 
 Please say yes. There are so many things I want to show you. 
 There's a garden I designed myself. 
 Oh, really. 
 Nina. Come on over. 
 Out host will be eager to introduce you. 
 Wow. 
 I might turn into a mouse at midnight. 
 It was worth the drive, wasn't it? 
 Impressive set of wheels. New purchase? 
 It is, indeed. 
 Lovely. 
 I would have thought you'd hold off until the... next collection. 
 Let me introduce you to General de Fournay and his wife. 
 She's quite smitten by your design and he loves to dress her to complement his medals. 
 He was decorated after the Ardennes. 
 Erm, excuse me for a moment. 
 You're here! We're so glad you came. 
 I wouldn't have missed seeing you in that dress. 
 I'm so glad you took the shrug. 
 It looks lovely on you. 
 Thank you. 
 It really does. It fits you like a glove. 
 Come! Come. There's so much I want to show you. And you must be starving. 
 Oh, wait. I'm sorry. Can I just grab a quick shot of you? 
 How was your trip? Mine was dreadful. 
 OK. 
 What was Charlotte thinking? 
 Hold that. Perfect. 
 Still, it would have been too obvious if she declined. 
 What do you mean too obvious? 
 Don't make me spell it out. 
 It's time you stopped seeing me as the pebble in your shoe, my dear. 
 We're both on the same side. 
 Mesdames, please come inside. The champagne won't last for ever. 
 (HORN TOOTS) 
 Must be the Contessa. Always the last to arrive. 
 Has to make an entrance. 
 Contessa. Looking lovely as always. 
 I would be the first to admit that I've made some unwise decisions in business. 
 But joining forces with Paul Sabine is not one of them. 
 With this new collection, Paul has announced that Paris is far from finished. 
 He recognises that this great nation is where couture and culture began. 
 I apologise to my American friends, but the truth hurts. 
 (LAUGHTER) 
 I salute a man who understands that timing makes the hero, and this is Paul Sabine's time. 
 His passion for the industry has remained steadfast through the dark years of the war. 
 And he has come through it with a shining vision of the future. 
 Our nation's future. 
 Vive la France. 
 All : Vive la France. 
 You're so lucky to have grown up there! 
 What? 
 In Paris. 
 I had a governess who told me about the thrilling carnivals in the Tuileries. 
 Did you ever go to one? 
 Ah... no. 
 I... I grew up about 40 kilometres from the nearest governess. 
 (GIGGLES) 
 Oh, you! 
 How funny. 
 Take no notice of him. 
 He's always had this very dark sense of humour. 
 Oh, right. I see. 
 And anyway, you can't fool me. 
 I know you've seen that side of Paris. 
 (LAUGHS) Thank you. 
 It's my pleasure. 
 You're American! 
 Keep it down. I'd like to stick around for dessert. 
 I've wanted to meet you for a while, Madame Sabine. 
 Me? Why? 
 I came over to do a story about your husband a few months back but it got derailed. 
 Now I'm working on something about ex-pats who stayed in Paris during the war. 
 Well, you should speak to my uncle. 
 His story is far more compelling than mine. 
 He runs the American hospital in Neuilly. 
 I know. I interviewed him. 
 He was the one who suggested we meet. He's a wonderful man. 
 This room was used by the Army in the Great War. 
 I once found a bullet casing in the wine cellar. 
 Better than in your wine. 
 (THEY GIGGLE) 
 Don't you agree? Claude? 
 Hmm? 
 Yes. Yes. 
 Maman, your champagne. Let me get you another one. 
 Maybe Cecile would like some more as well. 
 Right. 
 We're still working on his party etiquette. 
 Mm... 
 Small world, Monsieur Rossi. 
 What brings you here? 
 Toasting your success. I'm sorry I missed the show. 
 Oh, that's right - I wasn't invited to that one. 
 I'm sure you weren't invited to this one. 
 What business do you have with my wife? 
 I'm doing a story on-- 
 This is a private party. 
 Unless it's a gossip column, there's no story you're doing that would involve my wife. 
 Stay away from her. 
 
 
 
 Hm. 
 We need a better system, you and I. 
 Because you clearly can't read lips. 
 I was drowning in there. 
 You can save yourself. 
 (SIGHS) What's going on? 
 Seriously, one day you ask for my help... and the next I'm an open sore. 
 (EXHALES) Is it because I couldn't offer you a place to live? 
 Because you know your mother would've-- 
 It's not about my mother. 
 Is this about the man you saw outside my flat that day, holding a bottle of wine? 
 Cos he's a friend. 
 I don't want to know. 
 It's none of my business. 
 You can be friends with whomever you want. 
 Right. 
 But you shouldn't lie. Or hurt people. 
 Or play games with their feelings. 
 I've never played games-- 
 Yes. You did. 
 And you're doing it again right now with Cecile. 
 Or do you plan on making a fool of every girl you meet? 
 Oh, I... 
 Monsieur Trouvier wants to give us a tour of the gardens. 
 I thought you might wanna... 
 Yes. 
 Yes, I would. 
 (MAN CROONING ON RADIO) 
 Thank you. 
 You should let me fix that. 
 Fix what? 
 The loose button on your cuff. 
 May I? 
 Sure. 
 I don't believe I've seen you in this? Is it new? 
 Old. It only gets worn for weddings and funerals. 
 Oh. Has somebody died? 
 No. I'm having a drink with Dominique tonight. 
 I suggested a corner café but she insists on Le Cinq. 
 Thank you. 
 (BIRDSONG) 
 Rossi : He makes you work weekends. 
 That's either pure devotion or blind ambition. 
 In your case, it's probably more blind than pure. 
 How'd you get yourself invited to this? 
 You're like a bad penny, you know? 
 Who are you working for now? 
 I'm doing a story-- 
 I know the story. Who wants it this badly? 
 French paper. 
 They don't make me work on weekends. I go to parties in fancy châteaus. 
 I can get you a place over there. Last call, Billy. 
 Get out while you can. 
 Just leave. 
 Don't say I didn't warn you. 
 When the sh1t hits the fan, there isn't a laundry in Paris that'll get that stink off you. 
 What is it you think you got on him? 
 Proof. 
 Your boss made more than a few trips to Berlin and Vienna. 
 While his boss was spinning a story about keeping the industry in France. 
 I wonder what our host would think if he knew he was toasting a hero who'd been on two payrolls. 
 Then write it. 
 If you're so sure that you got the dirt on him, then publish the story and leave him the f*ck alone. 
 Jesus, what did you think was gonna happen this weekend? 
 You were gonna smoke him out, he was gonna confess over Cognac? 
 You're bluffing. You haven't got anything real on him. 
 You take your shot when the light is right, Billy. You know that. 
 Yeah, I do. 
 Ooh, that is some dress. 
 Now I know why you work weekends, kid. 
 Turns out you're not blind. Or pure. 
 Mademoiselle. 
 Monsieur. 
 What did he mean by that? 
 Oh, nothing. 
 Just stand a little closer to the hedge, please. 
 Billy, who was he talking about? 
 Just turn to face me. The light is flattening everything here. 
 So should I just-- 
 I just want you to stand still! 
 Jesus Christ, you were supposed to be out here an hour ago. 
 Was he talking about Monsieur? 
 Yes. Yes. He was accusing him... of doing some pretty nasty things during the war. 
 Like what? 
 It doesn't matter. 
 Yes, it does. 
 Do you believe him? 
 I don't know what I believe... any more. 
 Take the picture. 
 If only they could speak... what stories they might tell. 
 What a neck. 
 Imagine finding the right dress for her. 
 This one reminds me of someone we both know. 
 Did I mention I saw Madame Fortier at the theatre? 
 I didn't realise you two had such a long history. 
 I've only just met her. 
 Oh, please, Charlotte. 
 That kind of lie only works if you're dead and hanging on a wall. 
 We both know how you know her and why you didn't use her as a reference when you applied for this job. 
 You've been remarkably discreet, my dear. 
 But how long can you keep that up before Paul or, God forbid, Monsieur Trouvier learns the truth? 
 How will Generale de Fournay feel about you telling his wife what clothes to put on when you have spent so many years taking yours off? 
 What is that? 
 Nothing. 
 Charlotte forgot to bring a gift intended for Cecile. 
 We'll send it when we get home. 
 How many gifts does Cecile need? 
 Charlotte gave her one in Paris. 
 I'm not sitting through a dinner with me on one side of you and your mistress on the other. 
 Helen... 
 I didn't invite her. 
 It doesn't matter who invited her. 
 The fact is she's here and I am not crazy or delusional. 
 I should have said something weeks ago. 
 (KNOCKING) 
 Go ahead, answer it. 
 Nina. 
 Monsieur. I'm sorry to disturb you. 
 What's wrong? 
 Oh, pardon, monsieur. It can wait. 
 Does she know too? 
 She knows nothing. 
 Your brother might be willing to live with an arrangement, but I am not. 
 You tell her to leave. 
 I'll deal with this Monday morning. 
 No, you won't. 
 She won't be there Monday morning. I want her gone. 
 Gone. 
 A bit quiet here tonight. 
 Maybe everyone in Paris was invited to Chez Trouvier except for us. 
 Ah. No interest. I'm a city rat. 
 Santé. 
 Become very popular with Americans, this place. 
 I have heard Billy raving about the poulet frites. 
 Billy is easily impressed. 
 Have you spent much time with him? 
 I took him to a few clubs when he first got here. 
 Whatever happened to that reporter he came over with? 
 Did you show him some clubs as well? 
 You think I'm keen on entertaining every American who crosses my path? 
 I wasn't implying-- 
 I don't need to make friends with reporters, Victor. 
 It's not a career move that interests me. 
 What is? 
 I haven't decided yet, but... given that Monsieur Sabine's taste in models has shifted, maybe it's time I did. 
 Monsieur values you. Very much. 
 So do a few other designers in this town. 
 They give me lovely gifts. 
 What kind of gifts? 
 (HANDBRAKE CLICKS) 
 (CAR DOOR SHUTS) 
 (LOW CHATTER) 
 Always wanted to know where he hides it. 
 Where's the garage? 
 Who cares? 
 Bugatti only produced four Atlantic 39s. Trouvier owns one of them. 
 Trouvier owns one of everything. 
 Where are you going? This isn't exactly a quick getaway. 
 (DOOR CLUNKS) 
 What did I tell you? She's a killer. 
 I didn't expect anyone to still be here. 
 I was on my way out. 
 No, you weren't. 
 You were exactly where you wanted to be. 
 I live there too. 
 It's lovely. 
 Maybe we should make a suggestion to Monsieur. 
 (TELEPHONE RINGS) 
 Hello. 
 Maman. Maman, it's me. 
 Nina. What's wrong? 
 Remember that American reporter who came with Billy to the atelier? 
 He's here and... he's questioning what Monsieur did during the war. 
 What did you say? 
 I just... 
 I have to go. 
 Nina. 
 I hope you don't mind. I was calling my mother. 
 No. Of course not. Is everything all right? 
 Please don't say you regret joining us. 
 You're like a breath of fresh air. 
 Cecile is usually surrounded by people who are... anything but sincere. 
 Duplicitous, in fact. 
 I know how that feels. 
 There's someone here... who's made it very uncomfortable for me. 
 Do you mind telling me who that is? 
 An American reporter. 
 He... implied that I was only here because Monsieur and I had more than a professional relationship. 
 That couldn't be farther from the truth. 
 Shame on him. Hm? 
 I will have a private word with the Contessa. 
 They will be gone by breakfast. 
 Thank you. 
 Hey. How long does it take to pet a car? 
 I've only just got my hands on her. 
 What else have you been doing? 
 Chatting with your brother. 
 He followed me in here. 
 Why? 
 The seats are hardly broken in. 
 Original goatskin. 
 Get in. 
 Why did my brother follow you in here? 
 Who cares? It's just a business proposition. 
 Oh. 
 (CHATTER) 
 Probably keeps them in the boot room. Have a look. 
 No. I'm not swiping his keys. 
 We'll take her for a short spin. 
 It's 20 minutes to the front gate. I just wanna get out of here. 
 What's the rush? You just got here. 
 Let's go! 
 You were invited, weren't you? 
 Wasn't like you just showed up? 
 Did you? Just show up? 
 (LAUGHS) What's the rush to leave? 
 I hurt somebody I love. 
 Trying to be somebody I'm not. 
 She doesn't deserve that. 
 She'll forgive you. 
 (SIGHS) 
 She's young. She doesn't understand. 
 I can't be two people. 
 Oh, relax your crack. 
 It's called being an adult. 
 Everyone is two people. 
 Hell, I've been six in one weekend. 
 Stop fighting it, man, and enjoy it. 
 Marry the girl if you have to. I am. 
 What? 
 Next summer. In Provence. 
 She's a vapid little aristocrat my father set me up with. 
 She's nice enough. She's a bit toothy. 
 But she's good in the saddle. 
 You should come. (LAUGHS) 
 You could be my best man. 
 And I'll really, really mean it. 
 What the hell is wrong with you? 
 This is vintage Armagnac, you wasteful sh1t! 
 And this baby is 18-carat plated. 
 So don't try that again! 
 You can be replaced. This can't. 
 f*ck are you going? 
 Home. 
 I'm gonna walk. 
 You're gonna walk? 
 I came here to help, remember? You called me. 
 Right. 
 Right. 
 Sorry. 
 (CHUCKLES) 
 Why don't we get back in the car? Hm? 
 No need. 
 Cos I'm gonna do this standing up. 
 What are you doing? You're a lunatic, do you know that? 
 You should stay in your f*cking hole and never come out. 
 I'd rather be invisible than be a f*cking fraud like you. 
 (DOOR BANGS SHUT) 
 And what did you say? That I would magically disappear? 
 Because I won't. 
 Nobody expects you to disappear. 
 We just need to take a step back and... 
 And what? This has nothing to do with your wife. 
 Your mother opened her trap, didn't she? 
 Didn't she? 
 My mother never said one word. 
 I'm betting she couldn't wait to tell you what I did for a living during the war. 
 But what she didn't tell you is why. 
 She didn't tell me anything. 
 But it doesn't matter. I don't judge anyone... 
 Like hell it doesn't! 
 ...on what they did to get by and I don't judge you. 
 No. You just want to dispose of me. 
 What do you want? 
 For you to make a different choice! 
 I know you needed her family's money at the beginning but she's not who you need now. 
 You need me. 
 You may get the clients but I keep them coming back. 
 You can't ask me to make that choice. 
 I won't. 
 So you've made your decision. 
 This isn't the time or place to discuss this. 
 I'll let our host know you're not feeling well. 
 I can make my own excuses. 
 I can't allow that! 
 Fine. And what excuse will you give for your better half? 
 My wife will be dining with me. 
 Not your wife. Your brother. 
 (INSECTS CHIRRUPING) 
 (CHATTER IN BACKGROUND) 
 Somebody just rang the dinner bell. 
 I'm coming. 
 Look, Nina, I'm sorry if I snapped at you-- 
 It's not me you owe an apology. 
 What? 
 It's so easy for you to come here now, sip champagne in a place like this. 
 Roller-skate on the Place de la Concorde. 
 OK. This is about Monsieur Sabine. 
 Have you ever missed a meal? 
 Gone to bed not knowing if the person you said good night to may not be there in the morning? 
 Have you? 
 That's not fair. 
 Fair? 
 What's fair? 
 Nothing's fair. 
 If it weren't for Monsieur Sabine, my mother and I wouldn't even be here. 
 The papers he bought for us kept us from going to a place where nobody came back. 
 That's his crime, Billy. 
 You'd be surprised how many laws you have to break just to survive. 
 Nina, I... 
 I had no idea you and your mother were Jewish-- 
 Then it worked. 
 You wear the mask long enough, it becomes your face. 
 I'm sorry to disappoint you. 
 I'm not disappointed. 
 I wanna know more. I want you to trust me enough to tell me everything. 
 You can't capture it all in a picture, Billy. 
 Will you walk with me to dinner, please? 
 Of course. 
 I don't know much about the Marquise, but she must have captivated someone's attention because there are 30 portraits of her in the house. 
 He's been asking about you. 
 You not feeling well, dear? 
 I'm fine. Charlotte is not. 
 She won't be joining us for dinner. 
 You're welcome. 
 Madame Sabine. 
 Oh, sorry. I meant this one. 
 Oh. 
 (LAUGHS) 
 I just learned that Claude left. 
 Is he not feeling well? 
 I'm not entirely surprised. 
 Some bachelors just prefer their own company. 
 Are you sure he's already left? 
 Perhaps he could give Charlotte a lift. 
 Why? Is she ill too? 
 Oh, was it something we served? 
 No, my dear. Any germs that struck were carried here from the city. 
 Well, I hope Charlotte had some fun... short as it was. 
 I'm really glad you asked me to invite her. 
 Me too. 
 (TRAIN CLATTERING OVER TRACKS) 
 (LAUGHTER AND CHATTER) 
 Would you like one of these? 
 I'm sorry, Helen. 
 I knew when I met you... you spent your days surrounded by beautiful women... who desperately wanted your approval. 
 But you promised me something different. 
 And I didn't leave one lousy marriage to spend the next 40 years smiling. 
 And posing. 
 And keeping just enough gin in the cabinet to get to sleep. 
 I can't do that again. 
 No more lies. 
 (CHATTER IN BACKGROUND) 
 It's not... It's not that simple, though, is it? 
 It could all go away in a moment. 
 What could all go away? 
 There are people here who would take great pleasure in ruining me. 
 That reporter who sidled up to you before dinner... his subject is me. 
 What I did for the mayor during the war. 
 That's what he's looking for. 
 Well, then, let him look. 
 He's not gonna find anything. 
 Is he? 
 No. 
 Our host is probably wondering where we are. 
 I'm going to go fix my face. 
 I'll meet you in the dining room. 
 Why would you want to leave Paris? 
 What? 
 To go and work in a perfume factory. 
 Who told you that? 
 Cesar Cassatt. My brother asked him to find you a position in their company. 
 Don't work for him. 
 He's a snake. 
 As long as we're being honest, you're not the only one looking across the street. 
 Then what keeps you at the maison? 
 Habit. 
 Let's drop the game, Victor. 
 I'm starting to see two of you. 
 You and your conniving boss. 
 What do you mean? 
 It means he sent you here to find out what's in this bag. 
 Should I go to the ladies room so you can have a peek? 
 I'll save you the trouble. 
 Is this what he's looking for? 
 If he's looking for Billy's pretty pictures, he can have them back. 
 But not me. 
 He'll have to work a little harder for that. 
 Dominique. 
 Dominique! Wait! 
 Stay away from me, you lap-dog! 
 What are these? 
 (HORN BLARES) 
 (CHATTER) 
 Help. 
 Call the doctor. Call the doctor! 
 All right. I got it. 
 OK. I gotta go. 
 Madame Sabine. I was hoping we would have had a chance to chat over dinner, but unfortunately we were seated in different time zones. 
 Yes, that was a shame, wasn't it? 
 Yep. And now the Contessa tells me we're apparently leaving before breakfast. 
 How about we get together in Paris? 
 I'm gonna be there for another week or two. 
 I'm afraid not. It's a very busy month. 
 Ain't that a shame. 
 Mm. 
 All right. Well, here, just in case something opens up. 
 We already have your card, Monsieur Rossi. 
 Would you excuse us, my dear? Thank you. 
 Madame. 
 Apparently I didn't make myself clear earlier. 
 I was only extending a friendly invitation. 
 You're not a friend. 
 And your approach is misguided. 
 Is that so? 
 History only holds up one side of our lives, Monsieur Rossi. 
 The other side is held up by fiction. 
 You only seem to want to contribute to the latter. 
 On the contrary-- 
 If you have a question about my history, then you ask me. Stop stalking third parties. 
 If I thought I'd get an honest answer, I would. 
 But I think you've bought into your own lie, Monsieur Sabine, and that's what's so chilling. 
 You're a genuine fake. 
 Aren't we all?
