 Once Monsieur finds out it was my light that torched that dress... 
 I'm guessing my days here are pretty much numbered. 
 A body has been found on the rear corner of your property. 
 Buried in a shallow grave. 
 Paul : You thought this was the best place to hide your stupid mistake? 
 I thought there was no-one out there. 
 Except a curious dog and a morbid little girl. 
 My mother killed that sailor. 
 I already knew that. 
 [BLADE SLICES] 
 Does Claude know? 
 Promise me he'll never know. 
 If I can ever be helpful, don't hesitate to ask. 
 That's a nice pen. Special gift. 
 The Germans replaced the gold band with ivory during the war, and that was ivory. 
 I saw you yesterday... in church. 
 I don't go to church. 
 We introduced him to a very lovely couple. 
 The adoption will soon be formalised. 
 Where's the money? 
 I'll hold on to that. 
 You don't think things through, Nina. 
 It's my money. 
 I want it back. 
 You can't buy back what's no longer yours. 
 No man is interested in raising someone else's child. 
 Bravo! 
 [CHEERING] 
 Bravo! 
 Enjoy your moments. They never get as good as this again. 
 I need to tell you something. 
 Who the hell do you think you're talking to? 
 Do you want me to tell Claude who you really are? 
 Because I will. I will!

 [CAMERA SHUTTER CLICKS] 
 [REMEMBERS] Bravo! 
 Can you tell me about your first time at the property? 
 I was there less than an hour. 
 The agent showed me many that morning. 
 But you made an offer right away? 
 It was charming. 
 And felt a million kilometres from Paris. 
 Well, certainly the Paris that you travel in. 
 If you don't mind my asking... was that Rita Hayworth I saw yesterday? 
 I guess it was. 
 But you must know her? 
 ♪ Put the blame on me ♪ 
 I don't get to the cinema very often, Inspector. 
 Of course. Why should you buy a ticket when these lovely ladies disrobe for you free of charge? 
 Have you entertained any guests out at the cottage? 
 Other than your wife. 
 Have you already interviewed someone on my staff? 
 Victor Bastide. 
 He's the only one at the atelier who's aware of my personal affairs. 
 Then you have entertained a guest? 
 I've had a recent liaison. 
 But I've never brought her to the cottage. Never. 
 Have you loaned the place to anyone else since you purchased it? 
 My mother and brother stayed out there for a few nights last month. 
 Ah. That might explain the voices. 
 The little girl next door claimed to overhear an argument in the dead of night. 
 Woke her up. 
 What were they arguing about? 
 It's unclear. This child's not the most reliable witness. 
 May I ask when it began, this liaison? 
 It's a new development. 
 Do you anticipate this taking much longer, Inspector? 
 I have a very busy day ahead. Interviews... 
 May I have a contact number for your mother? 
 And your brother. 
 I may have to speak to them both. 
 [LIVELY CHATTER] 
 I hope you don't think I'm prying. 
 I never breathe when I can pant. 
 I just want to know everything. 
 Where did you go after the show? 
 I went home. 
 Oh. 
 Private party. Who with? 
 My mother. 
 Then I drank some warm milk and fell into bed. 
 Oh, God! Please hold on to that for as long as you can. 
 And the freckles. 
 Your mother must be very proud. 
 Pardon, Madame. The magazine's photographer has concept boards for... 
 Forget the boards. The concept is sitting right here. 
 You could shoot this girl anywhere. 
 This was on my desk. One of the girls took the message. 
 Fan mail already? 
 If you'll excuse me. I must go. 
 Don't say yes to him till I've seen the ring. 
 Anything less than ten carats is impolite. 
 Nina. 
 I can't talk right now. 
 What's wrong? 
 Nothing. I um... I'll find you later. 
 What's all this, then? Pictures from the show? 
 I haven't developed anything from yesterday. 
 Really? I figured you'd be up all night in your little dark room. 
 Oh, I was up all night in my little hotel room, pacing. 
 Monsieur Sabine left a message. 
 He wanted to see me first thing this morning. 
 And what did he say? 
 He hasn't yet. 
 He's probably still figuring out my bill for nearly torching the place. 
 It's fine. I've already put the word out. 
 "Got camera. Will work for food." 
 That's too bad. I was looking forward to more adventures. 
 So was I. You know, I had this plan for a shoot at the Place de la Concorde, on roller skates. 
 I don't even know if Nina skates or not. 
 Good luck, Billy. 
 You'll be missed. 
 I told him that it looked like someone had been out there before your family arrived. 
 You mentioned the glass in the sink? 
 And the back window was open. 
 What did you say when he asked why you waited so long to step forward? 
 I didn't want to say anything that would compromise you... 
 ...or hurt your wife. 
 Well done. 
 When will they talk to your brother? 
 Hmm? Oh, don't worry about that. 
 Will I have to speak to him again? 
 Hopefully not. 
 If I wasn't there with a guest, then... some local thug broke into the place to meet his victim. 
 That's what I said. Could have been anyone. 
 You don't have to do his job, Victor. Let him do the maths.

 Paul will be thrilled. Who wouldn't want Bergdorf's in their corner? 
 Me. Who's calling from New York? 
 Marjorie spoke to Harper's Bazaar. 
 Why? We have an exclusive on your husband. 
 It's not a cover, Eliette. 
 It's just hosting a small event. 
 Bergdorf's would like to do a little tease. 
 So does Rita Hayworth. 
 She scribbled her number on a sheet of toilet paper and handed it to me. 
 Is that an American custom? 
 I couldn't tell if it was her phone number or her measurements. 
 I would hope you'd know the difference, Maman. 
 Where is this calling card? Did you flush it? 
 Miss Hayworth's already phoned this morning and made an appointment. 
 New York will have to wait. Right now, Paris is calling. 
 The bell on your telephone is practically hoarse. 
 Even the wife's had to answer it. 
 I offered but dear Helen got there first, before I could leap over the desk. 
 Charlotte. 
 Would you mind taking these up to the studio, please? 
 [PHONE RINGS] 
 No. You get that, darling. 
 I'll get one of my girls to do it. 
 Charlotte : Paul Sabine. How can I help you? 
 Have you spoken to Claude since last night? 
 I tried but there was no answer. 
 Try again. You need to speak to him. 
 I'm sorry to interrupt. 
 You said first thing in the morning. 
 I did. 
 But I was called into another appointment across town. 
 We'll talk over there. 
 Charlotte : He'd be happy to see you, I'm sure. 
 We're looking forward to seeing you. 
 What was the appointment across town? 
 No idea. 
 Monsieur Sabine, I only set that light up over there because I wanted to get the best possible... 
 It's done. 
 But I will pay you back. 
 Once I land something else... 
 Last night was a learning curve, Billy. For everyone. 
 What? Are you saying you still want me to be here? 
 There's an elaborate layout being shot here this week. 
 Eliette's photographer is going to need help. 
 You want us both to shoot? 
 No. I said he needs help. 
 Setting up props, lighting. 
 Positioning the girls. Whatever's necessary. 
 Sure. 
 Do you want me to print the rolls from yesterday or...? 
 That can wait. You missed a button. 
 Charlotte, I'd like to see my diary, please. 
 Yes, of course. Certainly. 
 [BIRDSONG] 
 Was this the best place to meet? 
 It's the only place I knew that was in between. 
 Here. 
 Did you find out their name, the couple that have him? 
 Please. Look, it's already been a month. 
 The longer he's with them... 
 It's only been a couple of days, Nina. 
 What? 
 He was only just adopted. 
 When you came back to the convent... 
 He was there? 
 But the Mother Abbess told me... 
 She wanted to protect him. 
 And you. 
 I don't need her protection. I need a name. 
 Who has him? 
 Those records are locked in a cabinet in the Mother Abbess's office. 
 Then what are you doing here? 
 I want to help you. 
 I know how badly you want to see him. 
 It might be easier for you to get him back if you had the father's support. 
 Or his family's. 
 Or at least your mother's support. 
 Do you have that? 
 Nina, Mother Abbess believes she's doing what's best for the children. 
 Does she? 
 I never even saw her pick one up. 
 She doesn't. 
 She never did with me. 
 I'll get you a name. 
 Let's meet here again. 
 [CHATTER] 
 You must be Billy. 
 I'm Lewis Hayes. 
 You work for Jour de Mode? 
 Guess again. 
 Saturday Evening Post. 
 You called Charlie Fennan, looking for work? 
 Right. Yeah. Yeah. 
 Damn. 
 Every floor you climb, the birds just get prettier. 
 Who's on the roof? 
 I'm shocked you got past Charlotte. 
 Which one's Charlotte? 
 Oh, you'd remember her. 
 Ground floor. Makes Garbo look friendly. 
 If I'm keeping you from your work... 
 No, you're not. 
 I offered my services, but... they said they couldn't use me. 
 Are you a reporter? 
 Novelist. 
 But I'm helping some buddies start a magazine. 
 We scraped together enough for a photographer. 
 But... now that I see your setup... this may not be so tempting. 
 Where do I sign up? 
 Do you want some breakfast? 
 I had mine. 
 Before I had lunch. 
 Who's that from? The silent partner? 
 This is from me. Trouvier could barely offer an apology. 
 I was hoping to introduce you to him after the show, but... 
 I turned around and you were gone. 
 I had to feed my cat. 
 We have six orders placed for the wedding gown. 
 Mm? Charlotte just has to make sure none of the brides get married in the same country. 
 Shall we open this? 
 What for? 
 What for? We did it, Claude. 
 Our name is on the lips of every last fashion reporter in Paris. 
 Eliette's given us her next cover... cleared out Le Cinq this afternoon so the press could lick our feet. 
 And New York wants a taste, too. 
 Every outfit we showed was ordered. 
 Every single one. 
 Rita f*cking Hayworth is scribbling her name on our toilet paper. 
 The stars are finally aligned and we've got more... 
 You can use the bedroom. 
 Didn't realise you weren't alone. 
 We'll do this later. 
 Or... share this with your friend. 
 I'm gonna need more than that. 
 Hm? 
 I want to be at the press conference. 
 Sat at the table. 
 Claude, you're gonna have your hands full just ordering supplies. 
 That's not what I'm asking for. 
 [COIN DROPS ON FLOOR] 
 We'll talk about this later. 
 I just want to sit at the table. 
 You never wanted that. 
 I do now. 
 Careful what you wish for. 
 The press conference is at five o'clock. 
 You may not want your guest to hang around for breakfast. 
 The next knock on your door might be a detective. 
 There's an investigation out at the cottage. 
 They found a body buried in a shallow grave. 
 What the hell are you talking about? 
 Evidently, it's not that unusual. Small town, vigilantes. 
 There are advantages to not sitting at the table, Claude. 
 Mother Abbess : "We received a note from your daughter Nina." 
 Nun : He was only just adopted. 
 Mother Abbess : "Her note was accompanied by a gift for our convent. Cash. The child has found a suitable and loving home. But I would ask that you turn to prayer and not interfere with God's plan. This donation, as much as we appreciate it, cannot be accepted. 
 [REMEMBERED VOICES] 
 "I can't help but feel that your daughter sent this for reasons other than charity. We know this is a difficult time for your daughter." 
 "Turn to prayer..." 
 " ...and not interfere..." 
 I want to help you. 
 "...cannot be accepted." 
 "...a gift for our convent." 
 "... and not interfere with God's plan." 
 Ladies and gentlemen, fashion has to reflect the times we're living in. 
 Monsieur Sabine understands that we've lost something that we need as much as oxygen. 
 Hope. 
 I'm not speaking out of turn? 
 Not at all. 
 Every new collection begins with a conversation. 
 This one began with my lovely wife, whose desire to feel feminine again served as my inspiration. 
 Yes, but your genius is understanding that every woman including the working girl on the street shares this desire. 
 Monsieur Sabine proves that by plucking a lowly seamstress from his atelier and placing her front and centre. 
 That's what's revolutionary about this collection. 
 I never intended a revolution. 
 [LAUGHTER] 
 I just thought it was time we closed the chapter on austerity, making do. 
 But choosing that young woman projects the spirit of the hour. 
 If a common girl can slip into the right dress and become a princess, well, that confirms the social relevance of fashion. 
 There's nothing common about her! 
 What's common is believing a pretty frock gives you class. It doesn't. 
 Eliette's point is well made. 
 A young girl like that just wants a scarf, a handbag, a lipstick, that makes her believe that romance is waiting around every corner. 
 [CHATTER] 
 What are those for? 
 Monsieur wanted me to wear those for the magazine shoot. 
 Oh. 
 Leave that one. The sleeve is torn. 
 Juliette will bring it downstairs when it's ready. 
 Charlotte said you rushed out early this morning for an appointment. 
 I just... needed to take a walk. 
 I've barely left this building for days. 
 I wanted to sit in the park. 
 Alone? 
 I had a feeling... you might have gone to meet somebody. 
 Maybe you wanted to be with someone your own age. 
 And who would that be? 
 I don't know. 
 [SIGHS] 
 This is yours. You did earn it. 
 After last night... 
 I expect you'll be earning a lot more. 
 You've been given a gift, Nina. 
 You can use this to forget about past mistakes and move on. 
 Not when you see him every day. 
 See who? 
 Who do you see every day? 
 You told me Monsieur Sabine... 
 It's Claude. 
 What? 
 [LAUGHS] 
 Stop. 
 [LAUGHS] 
 Stop laughing! 
 I have to laugh. 
 I thought you were safe. 
 All this time I've been angry with you, when I should have been angry with me. 
 Me trusting him. 
 Trusting he will never touch you. 
 He doesn't like women that way. He's safe. He's safe. 
 Who initiated this? You or him? 
 Well, you weren't this angry when you thought it was his brother. 
 Why would you do this? 
 What were you thinking? 
 You can't possibly hate yourself that much. 
 [CHATTER STOPS] 
 [LIVELY CHATTER] 
 Claude : Another. 
 You might want to pace yourself. 
 We've been invited back to Eliette's for cocktails. 
 Mm-hm. 
 Fun. Is mine gonna be served in a dog bowl? 
 Claude, she is a huge fan. 
 I know. 
 Until she's not, because there's a new magazine on the rack every month. 
 Can I get another one, please? 
 I don't need her permission. 
 You know, it's never sat right with me, this arrangement between the two of you. 
 But I learned from my first marriage that no-one on the outside has the right to judge. 
 Claude, I love you both. 
 And I've just come to believe that... maybe it's worked this far because you and your brother are driven by completely different impulses. 
 You want the world to match what's swirling round in your head, and... 
 Paul... I don't know. 
 Sometimes I think Paul just wants to even the score. 
 Even what score? 
 He'll never have what you have. 
 Your mother reminds him of that every chance she gets. 
 You took the long way to the powder room. 
 Oh. I'll just be a minute. 
 No rush. I've told Eliette we'll do cocktails another time. 
 I've got plenty to do back at the office. 
 I don't understand. Did Eliette invite Claude? 
 Or was that Helen's idea? 
 Monsieur just asked me to arrange a car to pick up his brother. 
 You'd think Monsieur would be tired of giving so many interviews. 
 Didn't he start his day with one? 
 I'm not sure. 
 Well, he should stop talking and let the clothes speak for themselves. 
 Fortier? 
 Why do I know that name? 
 Red-headed lady. Didn't I meet her last night? 
 Came with a gentleman. Tall, silver-haired. 
 He was distinguished. 
 She looked like something checked out of a doll hospital prematurely. 
 I'm not familiar with her. Perhaps a friend of Marjorie Sutter. 
 Not the lady I'm thinking of. 
 You've written that name three times, dear. 
 
 
 
 [PHONE RINGS] 
 Paul Sabine. This is Charlotte speaking. 
 I'm afraid not. He's already left for the day. 
 Monsieur has left as well. 
 She is, actually. Would you like to speak with her? 
 It's a gentleman for you, Madame. 
 Inspector Bompard. 
 Where have you been? 
 Never met a locked door you couldn't pick, have you? 
 That detective stopped by. 
 He wants to interview me. Tomorrow. 
 He's not as stupid as he looks. 
 Did you tell him that? 
 He'll be calling in Claude next. 
 Yes, he might. 
 We can't let that happen. 
 There's only so much I can do, Maman. 
 I'm still playing catch-up, remember? 
 You need to pay him off before he questions your brother. 
 You want me to bribe the inspector? 
 Why not? You've got cash coming in now. 
 Offer him a piece of the business if you have to. 
 That's not gonna happen Paul. 
 The war's over! 
 We're not selling off our future. 
 What future? 
 How can they crown you if you don't have a head? 
 My head's not gonna be the one on the block. 
 You won't walk away smelling any better than me. 
 I can promise you that. 
 Stop strategising. 
 Your thoughts only get you in more trouble. 
 What is your plan? 
 Go home, Maman. 
 Let me do my work.

 [TIN CANS GENTLY CLATTERING] 
 [DOG BARKING IN DISTANCE] 
 Girl : Manou! Manou! Come back! 
 Manou! Manou! Come back! 
 Bompard : So you're convinced there were intruders? 
 I'm convinced that whoever owned that cottage before my son had some unfinished business. 
 Are you relying on intuition, Madame, or evidence? 
 That place is haunted. 
 The floors grab at your heels, the walls have eyes. 
 I couldn't wait to leave. 
 During your stay, did you discover anything that suggested an actual stranger had been in the house? 
 We had to step over a rotting carcass to get inside. 
 This was no Easter Bunny, Inspector. 
 That animal had been savagely killed and left there as a warning. 
 Who do you think left it there? 
 It wasn't a fox. 
 It was a "gift" from someone who didn't want us there. 
 I begged my son not to buy that place. 
 He dismissed me as a superstitious old fool. 
 But the cards never lie! 
 The cards? 
 The Tower card was upright. 
 That always spells disaster. 
 May I show you? 
 Uh... that's not necessary, Madame. 
 Perhaps, if you have the stomach to look at some photographs of the victim? 
 I'm trying to construct an identity with very few puzzle pieces. 
 Inspector, the world we can't see is much more revealing than the one we can. 
 Come back! Stop! 
 Come back! Bad boy. 
 Bad! 
 Sorry, Monsieur. I tried to stop him. 
 You needn't bother. He probably enjoyed it more than I would have. 
 I only lick the plate when it's cake. 
 Are you a gendarme? 
 No. I'm the new owner. 
 But I haven't stayed here long enough to brush my teeth. 
 Do you live next door? 
 I'm not allowed past those trees any more. 
 Maman gets very cross. 
 Oh, yes. That's right. There's been some trouble. 
 Are you... Josette? 
 How do you know that? 
 Lucky guess. 
 You met my little brother Claude. 
 He's not little. 
 [LAUGHS] No, you're right. Not so much any more. 
 But I happen to know he was very taken with your castle. 
 I've shut it down. 
 That's a shame. 
 Did it have a drawbridge? 
 And a moat, too. 
 But it's all gone now. 
 I haven't been back since they took Heinrich away. 
 Heinrich? 
 My prisoner. 
 It's the only German name I know. 
 Is "Gustav" German? 
 I think it is. 
 Did you have more than one prisoner? 
 No. But somebody else tried to hide in there with him. 
 He came one night and pounded on the door. 
 They were screaming at each other. 
 But Heinrich wouldn't let him in. 
 He may have been hiding there for the whole war. 
 That's what my grandfather says. 
 Makes sense. 
 Be a very good hiding place, wouldn't it? 
 [DOOR OPENS] 
 Hello. 
 Hello. 
 Would you like some of this? 
 What? No. 
 I don't blame you. It's been by the radiator all day. 
 It's more like a baked apple. 
 Why did you pretend it wasn't you who I saw in church? 
 Maybe I didn't want to be seen. 
 Is that just there or... all the time? 
 I know what they say about you, Victor. 
 But I don't care. 
 It doesn't matter to me. 
 The war is over. 
 We've all done things we regret. 
 Some of us more than others. 
 Well, as my grandmam likes to say, "Every angel has a past. Every sinner has a future." 
 It's never too late for people to change.

 Please. Put some on your wrists. 
 Actually, I'm wearing... 
 I know what you're wearing, Madame. 
 We created it. 
 It has an earthy note. It plays on the jasmine but doesn't smother it. 
 It reminds me of something. 
 Fresh lingerie. 
 Yes. That, too.

 Once my husband has chosen the design for the bottle, when can the maison expect a prototype?

 Yeah. It has a certain carnal appeal. 
 Paul : You don't sound convinced. 
 No, I am. 
 It smells like... lilacs... served up in the right pair of knickers. 
 I bet you're terribly relieved you didn't marry that brother. 
 Maurice, darling! 
 Mm? 
 The single on Monsieur Sabine. 
 Of course. 
 Hadn't noticed this one before. 
 I must have been lost in the wallpaper on his chest. 
 I don't usually make deliveries. 
 Are you looking for a tip? 
 [LAUGHS] Only if I earn it. 
 I'd like to see you again. 
 You sure that's a good idea? 
 I came back, didn't I? 
 What? 
 Are you angry I wasn't completely honest the first time I visited? 
 I'm just fascinated by the lengths some people will go to to be dishonest.

 Look, she's with people and... it's not so simple, all right? 
 It's a long story. All right? Her name's Dominique.

 No... 
 Oh, Jesus, Billy! You're half way out of there. 
 Take a souvenir. For me. 
 All right. 
 Hey, keep the change. All right? 
 Where have I seen you before? I don't forget a pretty face. 
 Wait. Where's my bag? 
 What? 
 My camera was hanging on the back of this chair. 
 Where the hell is it? 
 Easy, man. 
 No. Where is my bag? It was hanging on the back of this chair. 
 Oh! 
 Oh, f*ck! 
 Look, I got a friend who can loan you a camera. 
 No. I don't want another camera! I want my camera. 
 He hired some goon to steal it so he could get me out of here. 
 Who stole it? 
 He couldn't fire me. He couldn't. 
 That would be too obvious. 
 Billy? 
 There were three rolls from the show in that bag, Lewis. 
 That's why he didn't want me to develop them. 
 He's planned this so when he finally does ask, I'll look like an incompetent jackass who doesn't know how to button his shirt. 
 Are we talking about your boss? 
 He's keeping me around... so I have to crawl back on my hands and knees and beg him not to blackball me. 
 Who's gonna hire me after this? 
 Billy? 
 Rossi was right. 
 What was he doing during the war? Why did he stay in Paris? 
 If you thought this guy was playing you, why have you stuck around? 
 Has this got something to do with that girl on the roof? Nina? 
 Stop bringing her up. She's got nothing to do with this. 
 Bullshit. I'm betting she's the reason you're still standing here. 
 I had that camera since I was 17 years old. 
 It's a hunk of metal. You didn't lose your eyes. 
 Nobody knows what they're walking into. 
 Shoot. 
 When I got here, they were still taking down signs... in German. 
 Everybody's still looking over their shoulders... wondering who they can trust? 
 Who pointed the finger? Who didn't? 
 The cat you work for is more nervous about his neighbours than some kid who came to capture the light. 
 That is what you came for, isn't it? 
 Soft, grey skies? 
 Everything slightly out of focus. 
 If you wanted transparency, you'd be in f*cking Cleveland. 
 [CANS GENTLY CLATTERING] 
 What did my mother want? Why was she badgering you? 
 Some nonsense about a guest at the show. 
 She wasn't satisfied with my answer... so she offered to read my cards. 
 [SHE LAUGHS] 
 Careful. 
 That's how she tenderises before she eats you. 
 Mm. 
 I've been trapped in a fitting room with worse than her. 
 I'm quick with a hanger. 
 What just happened? 
 Bompard may be calling you as well. 
 Why? I've never been out there. 
 I told him that. 
 But he's looking to catch me in a lie. 
 So what would you like me to say? 
 The truth. 
 May I go with you to New York? 
 I'm not going. 
 Because of Eliette? 
 Bompard. 
 He won't let me leave Paris until his investigation's further along. 
 Well, that's a shame. There's so many people there wanting to meet you. 
 How come you haven't asked me about it? 
 About what? 
 The body at the cottage. 
 Do you think I had anything to do with it? 
 No. 
 It never crossed my mind. 
 [KEYS RATTLE] 
 [EXHALES SHARPLY] 
 [KEYS RATTLING] 
 Hey. What are you doing here? 
 Aren't they shooting that magazine spread today? 
 What's happened? 
 Nina, what's wrong? 
 Erm... 
 I need a place to live. 
 Is your mother all turned out about that modelling business? 
 It's not that. It's just... 
 I need to be on my own. 
 I can't... share a room with her any more. 
 It's just... 
 Well, I suppose... if you can tolerate seeing Dominique without her war paint, you could always spend a few nights in her tub. 
 Something better will come up. 
 I'll ask around. 
 We will figure this out, Nina. I promise. 
 I should go. I'm late. 
 This was just dropped off for you. 
 Has Monsieur spoken to you yet? 
 No. Why? 
 He was wondering if you'd seen Nina. 
 She was supposed to be here an hour ago. 
 I don't know. 
 Wait! Who dropped this off? 
 Wait. Where's the film? 
 [CORK POPS] 
 That's impressive. 
 Where'd you bag this? On safari? 
 On flea market. 
 Oh. 
 Mm. 
 Nice. 
 Oh, and the chipped china really brings out the vintage. 
 Yeah, sorry. Couldn't find a glass. 
 It's either these or my boot. 
 Something happen with your bride? 
 Hm? 
 The girl from the show who was here earlier. 
 Another house trying to steal her away? 
 No. We wouldn't let that happen. 
 I can see why. She was a knockout. 
 Certainly showcased your brother's talent. 
 I imagine when you find someone who inspires you... 
 She inspires me. 
 I'm the talent. 
 I know all about your talents. 
 No, you don't. 
 No-one does. 
 Well, maybe you should change that. 
 Toot your own horn a bit. 
 Although I don't know why you'd want to. 
 All that attention is such a burden. 
 Flying under the radar is much more fun. 
 You can get drunk before lunch. 
 I don't get it. It doesn't make sense. 
 I asked the desk clerk, he didn't send it to the maison. 
 Maybe it was the night shift. It's got your name in the bag. 
 Well, why did they take my film? 
 Could've fallen out. It could still be under one of those sticky tables. 
 Wait, Lewis. That's him. 
 That's the guy. 
 Billy, sit down. Sit down! 
 That is the goon Sabine hired to shadow me. 
 That goon is following me, not you. 
 He's American. 
 Look at the shoes. 
 Sit down. 
 Why's he following you? 
 Cos I'm starting a rag with two writers who support the communists who are part of the government here. 
 The White House sees that as one step away from Moscow. 
 [LAUGHS] Don't want us smuggling radical French ideas into our poetry. 
 Lewis, that guy was in the bar last night... 
 And he'll be here tomorrow. As long as I am. 
 Billy, the Government of National Unity here won't last. 
 This country's on the verge of a civil war. 
 He wants to make sure I'm on the right side of it. 
 This is about a lot more than pretty dresses. 
 [MUSIC MUFFLES SPEECH] 
 And... beautiful. 
 If you'd be so kind as to simply centralise yourself here... 
 He doesn't like women that way. He's safe. 
 It might be easier for you to get him back if you had the father's support. 
 You can't possibly hate yourself that much. 
 I'm not a chair! 
 Well... 
 Who blew out her pilot light? 
 The week might've caught up with her. 
 If you could show... 
 Hey. 
 [WHISPERS] This is obviously awful but... keep that dress on. 
 I got an idea with roller skates. Do you skate? 
 OK. Downhill only. But I'll keep hold of the belt and I'll have one hand free to take shots from behind. 
 [SOFTLY] Inspector Bompard is in your office. 
 Inspector. 
 Did we have an appointment? 
 We did not. I hope you'll forgive the intrusion. 
 That's fine. 
 But why's my mother here? 
 I asked to be here. Claude couldn't be reached. 
 Has there been some development in the case? 
 We found new evidence that shed some light on the victim's identity. 
 That little girl next door was more insightful than we thought. 
 Was she? 
 Yes. 
 We found a personal item inside the barn that might've belonged to the victim. 
 A fountain pen. 
 Certainly substantiates that he was very likely a German. 
 Possibly hiding in the countryside for years. 
 Your instincts were spot on, too, Maman. 
 Those walls did have eyes. 
 [LAUGHS WEAKLY] 
 Thank you, Inspector. 
 No. Thank you. 
 I'm sorry we had to trouble you with this. 
 Paul : It's no trouble at all. 
 [DOOR OPENS AND CLOSES] 
 [CHATTER] 
 Billy. 
 Get your camera. I've asked Eliette to let you take this shot. 
 [LAUGHS] 
 Monsieur Sabine... 
 Ah, thank you. 
 OK. All right. That's nice. 
 Monsieur Sabine, could you just... Great. Hold that. 
 Eliette : Perfect. 
 The mighty sorcerer surrounded by all his apprentices. 
 Billy : Really great. 
 OK. Really nice. Keep your eyes to me. Everybody. 
 Here we go. 
 Wait just here.
