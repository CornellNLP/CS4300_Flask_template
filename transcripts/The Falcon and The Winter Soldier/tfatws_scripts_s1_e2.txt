 RHODES:  World's a crazy place right now.   Alliances are all torn apart. 
 The world's broken. Thank you, Captain America. But this belongs to you. DR. RAYNOR:  Tell me about your most recent nightmare.   (GRUNTS) - (GUNSHOT) - (GASPS) Look, I know that you have been through a lot, but you've got your mind back, you are being pardoned. You're free. To do what? TORRES: Oh, bam! Right there! You see these guys? These're the guys you gotta worry about. They call themselves the Flag Smashers. They want a world that's unified without borders. SAM:  So, this is the leader of the Flag Smashers, huh?   - (GROANS) - He's strong. SARAH: Oh, my God, Sam. You better look at this. (MAN ON TV)  Join me in welcoming your new Captain America.   Reliving the glory days? (BOTH CHUCKLE) I remember sneaking into this locker room before each game to see you. It's probably why we always won. You nervous? - Who, me? - Mmm-hmm. Never. (CHUCKLES SOFTLY) I've been a captain before, obviously, but this is different. This is... Everybody in the world expects me to be something. And I don't wanna fail them. - I know. - Yeah. Be yourself. Yeah. They're gonna love you. (CHUCKLES) Good luck. - Love you. - Love you. (MUFFLED CROWD CHEERING) - Did he puke yet? - Not yet. You're up. - Copy that. - WALKER: Good morning. Good morning, America. Good morning. (SOFTLY) No, you're Captain America, you're not... (IN NORMAL VOICE) Good morning. John, Captain, uh... Captain America. And that's why you failed drama class. (LAUGHS) - Can you believe this? - (CHUCKLES) I know, right? - (CHUCKLES) Yeah. - Two weeks ago we're prepping the team for a special ops mission in Chile, now this. Don't get me wrong, this has been great, it's been great, but it's been a lot of handshakes, a lot of suits, a lot of speeches, and senator meetings, and I just wanna do the job. - This is the job, John. - Yeah. All of it is. Star-spangled man with a plan and all that. It's always been in the job description. Listen, this suit, it comes with expectations, brother. WALKER: Mmm-hmm. You can't just punch your way out of problems anymore, you know? Mmm-hmm. Time to go to work. Time to go to work. (MARCHING BAND PLAYING UPBEAT MUSIC) (BAND CONTINUES PLAYING UPBEAT MUSIC) (CROWD CHEERING) Thank you. (CROWD CONTINUES CHEERING) (OVER MIC) Ladies and gentlemen...   Your new Captain America!   - (CROWD CHEERING) - (FIREWORKS BURSTING) Good morning, America.   (CROWD CHEERING) Yeah! (CHUCKLES) Thank you so much for coming. This has gotta be fun, though, coming back to your high school after so much has changed? - FAN: John Walker! - (CHUCKLES) Oh, it's great. We're... - (CROWD CHEERING) - Oh!   Yeah.   John, I think the first thing everyone wants to know   is what is it like being Captain America?   Do eagles fly overhead wherever you go?   - (LAUGHS) Uh, yes.   - (CHUCKLES) Yeah, that and flags tend to start majestically waving in the wind.   And how's the tour been?   I know they did a big rollout for you, right?   It's the greatest honor of my life.   Um, but I'm just a little shocked, I think.   How did a guy like me end up here?   (CHUCKLES) Oh, wait, wait, wait. "A guy like me"? Somebody's being a bit too humble.   For those of you who aren't familiar with his résumé,   "John Walker, first person in American history   to receive three Medals of Honor",   "ran RS-One missions in counterterrorism and hostage rescue".   The government did a study of your body at MIT,   and you tested off the charts in every measurable category.   Speed, endurance, intelligence...   Look, here's the thing, uh, I'm not Tony Stark,   I'm not Dr. Banner, okay?   I don't have the flashiest gadgets, I don't have super strength.   But what I do have   is guts.   Something Captain America always had,   always needs to have, and I'm gonna need every ounce of it.   Because I got big shoes to fill.   ANNOUNCER:  Did you know Steve Rogers?   WALKER:  I was two years out of West Point   when Steve came back on the scene.   I followed his career very closely as an Avenger.   I like to think that I modeled my work after his.   ANNOUNCER:  So, you've always wanted to be a hero?   I liked that what I was doing would make people feel safe.   Steve Rogers was the kind of guy who could do that,   he gave me hope.   Even though I never met him,   he feels like a brother.   ANNOUNCER:  Wow.   TORRES:  Seems like a good guy.   - You met him? - No. Thanks for doing this on such short notice. Yeah. No sweat. I'm just finishing up the checklist. You'll be all good to go once you land in Munich. - Shouldn't have given up the shield. - Good to see you too, Buck. - This is wrong. - Hey, hey, look, I'm working, all right? So all this outrage is gonna have to wait. You didn't know that was gonna happen? No, of course I didn't know that was gonna happen. You think it didn't break my heart to see them march him out there and call him the new Captain America? This isn't what Steve wanted. Oh, my God. So, what do you want me to do? Call America and tell 'em I changed my mind? Huh? (CHUCKLES) Yeah, right. It's a great reunion, buddy, be well. You had no right to give up the shield, Sam. Hey. This is what you're not gonna do. You're not gonna come here in your overextended life and tell me about my rights. It's over, Bucky. Besides, I have bigger things to deal with now. What could be bigger than this? This guy. His connections with rebel organizations all over Eastern and Central Europe, and he's strong. Too strong. And? Well, he's been connected to this online group called the Flag Smashers. Now, Redwing traced them to a building somewhere outside of Munich. - So that's where I'm going. - Well, I don't trust Redwing. - Hold on a minute. - You don't have to trust Redwing, but I'mma go see if he's right. 'Cause I have a feeling they might be a part of the Big Three. - What "Big Three"? - The Big Three. - What Big Three? - Androids, aliens, and wizards. - That's not a thing. - That's definitely a thing. No, it's not. Every time we fight, we fight one of the three. So, who are you fighting now, Gandalf? How do you know about Gandalf? I read  The Hobbit  in when it first came out. - So you see my point? - No, I don't. There are no wizards. - Doctor Strange. - Is a sorcerer. Aah! (CHUCKLES) A sorcerer is a wizard without a hat. Think about it. Right? I'm right. I just came up with that. It's crazy. But that's not the point. These guys aren't magical. All right? They use brute force just like you, the incredibly annoying guy in front of me with the staring problem. - BUCKY: I'm coming with you. - SAM: No, you're not. (ALARM BLARES) One minute to drop off, Sam. So what's our plan? Great. So no plan. Thirty seconds! - Enjoy your ride, Buck. - No, you can't call me that. Why not? That's what Steve called you. Steve knew me longer, and Steve had a plan. TORRES: Fifteen seconds to drop. FALCON: I have a plan. Really? What is it? Great. Where's the chute? We're at     feet. It's too low for a chute. WINTER SOLDIER: I don't need it anyway. You sure about that? Yeah. (YELLING) (GRUNTING AND GROANING) (GROANS) FALCON:  I have all of that on camera. You know that, right? Get out of my face, Sam, or I'll break it.   Okay, head north. Come on. FALCON:  Oh-ho-ho. Don't hurt him. You're doing the staring thing again. They're in there. - Where's the guy? - FALCON: I don't know. I think they're smuggling weapons, though. - Well, I think you could be right. - Hmm. But there's only one way to find out. I see a clear path. I say we take it. We're not assassins. I'll see you inside or not. Hey, come on, man. I'm just messing with you. Come back. Look at you. All stealthy.  (CHUCKLES) A little time in Wakanda and you come out White Panther. - It's actually White Wolf. - Huh? All right, I'm inside. Therefore, way ahead of you. It's not great, but very doable. Huh? - Hello. How are you? - Good. What did I miss? Nothing. - All right, let's go. - No, wait. I got a vibranium arm. I can take them. And I can fly. Who gives a sh1t? Wait. - I want to see where they're going. - There's two people. - You only see two? - That's what I saw. - Let me see what Redwing sees. Let me see. - All right. FALCON: Let's see what Redwing... Oh, look at that. How many people you see now? - One, two... Oh, here it comes again. - (SIGHS) - Four. Five. - Yeah, five. Yeah. WINTER SOLDIER: So they're strong. Whatever. - All right, let's go. - No, no, wait. - (CLATTERING) - FALCON: sh1t. WOMAN: All right, let's move. - Let's move. Yeah. - (ENGINE STARTING) (KEY TAPPING) There's an eighth person. I think they have a hostage. They're stealing medicine. Vaccines. Hi. FALCON:  Bucky, talk to me. What's goin' on?   Found the hostage. You okay? sh1t. (GRUNTS) (ALL GRUNTING) (GRUNTING) I always wanted to do that. (GRUNTS) Good of you to join the fight, Sam! (ALL GRUNTING) (TIRES SKIDDING) (STRAINING) (CLANG) (BOTH GRUNTING) (GRUNTS) Sam. John Walker, Captain America. Lemar Hoskins. Looks like you guys can use some help. (ALL GRUNTING) - (TIRES SCREECHING) - (FALCON GRUNTING) (CAR HORNS BLARING) - That little girl kicked your ass. - (YELLS) (GRUNTS) (GRUNTING) John, where you at, man? (BOTH GRUNTING) - (GROANS) - Could have used that shield. (STRAINED) Get off of me. - (FALCON GRUNTS) - (PANTING) Those were all Super Soldiers, Sam. FALCON: I know. You're welcome, by the way. (CHOKING) (YELPS) MALE SOLDIER: I'm okay. I'm okay. That was a bad idea. (BOTH GRUNTING) - (TIRES SCREECH) - (GRUNTS) (GROANING) (PANTING) - Sorry about Redwing. - FALCON: No, you're not. FALCON: What's going on in that big cyborg brain of yours? - It's computing. - (FALCON CHUCKLES) You know what? I can actually see it. I can see the gears turning. Oh, they're malfunctioning, shutting down. Yep, they're on fire. We gotta figure out where the serum's coming from. Yeah. And how in the hell after    years are there eight Super Soldiers runnin' loose? (HORN HONKING) CAPTAIN AMERICA: So that didn't go as planned, huh? - Okay. (GRUNTS) - (DOOR CLOSES) Let's keep going. Look, at least we know what we're up against now, huh? And we're pretty sure it's one of the Big Three, so... - FALCON: Aliens, androids, or wizards? - CAPTAIN AMERICA: Pretty sure. There's no such thing as wizards. - All right, then it's aliens, or androids... - Or Super Soldiers. - sh1t. Super Soldiers, for real? - FALCON: Yeah. Wow. All right, well, then we gotta work together. That's not happening. I think we stand a much better chance if we all just... Just 'cause you carry that shield, it doesn't mean you're Captain America. Look, I've done the work, okay? You ever jump on top of a grenade? Yeah. Actually, I have. Four times. It's a thing I do with my helmet. It's a reinforced helmet. It's a long story, but, any... Look, it's    miles to the airport. You guys need a ride. Guys. Gary, stop. Get in. Okay, so we've got eight Super Soldiers on a bulk supply run. Why? They say their mission is to get things back to the way it was during The Blip. Maybe they're just trying to help. They had a funny way of showing it. That serum doesn't exactly have a great track record. No offense. We need to figure out where they're going. How'd you track 'em here? The Flag Smashers? Uh, no, we didn't track them, we tracked you, uh, through Redwing. You hacked my tech? (CHUCKLES) Sorry. It's not exactly hacking. It's government property. Kind of the government. (CHUCKLES) Does he always just stare like that? You get used to it. Okay, look, (CLEARS THROAT) you know, things have gotten kind of, uh... Chaotic. Yeah. The GRC, they're doing the best they can to get things up and running smoothly, post Blip. LEMAR: Reactivating citizenship, social security, healthcare. Basically just managing resources for the refugees who were displaced by the return. The Global Repatriation Council does all that. I get that. So why exactly are you two here? Well, they provide the resources and we keep things stable. Yeah, violent revolutionaries aren't usually good for anyone's cause. Usually said by the people with the resources. CAPTAIN AMERICA: We got a lot of resources. If you guys, if you joined up with us, we could... - No. - I got mad respect for both of y'all. But you were getting your asses kicked till we showed up. - Who are you? - Lemar Hoskins. Look, I see a guy hanging out of a helicopter in tactical gear, I need a lot more than Lemar Hoskins. I'm Battlestar. John's partner. "Battlestar"? Stop the car! CAPTAIN AMERICA: Look, I... I get it, okay? I get the attitude, I do. You didn't think that the shield was gonna end up here. I get it, Bucky. And I'm... I'm not trying to be Steve. I'm not trying to replace Steve. I'm just trying to be the best Captain America I can be. That's it. It'd be a whole lot easier if I had Cap's wingmen on my side. (SCOFFS) It's always that last line. CAPTAIN AMERICA: Let's go. (KNOCKS ON DOOR) (WHISTLES) MAN: You must be famished. - Very hungry. - SOLDIERS: Yeah. - SOLDIER: Yeah, we are hungry. - Okay. My wife and I cooked. It's an old family recipe made with the finest chicken livers. Please serve yourselves. - Anything you want. Anything. You ask me. - KARLI: Um... There is some coffee here and some crackers. - KARLI: We're okay. Thank you. - Uh, anything we can do for the cause. Please follow me. You're becoming a bit of a legend. I hear more and more people talk about the freedom fighters who are pushing back. They call you Robin Hood. Every day more people love you. You'll find refuge wherever you go. My wife and I made this just for you. Everything is completely clean. - KARLI: Okay. - RUDY: She made it nice and cozy. - SOLDIER  : Thank you. Yeah! - RUDY: You're welcome. - (CELL PHONE DINGS) - SOLDIER  : Oh, my gosh, beds. LENNOX: That's real nice. SOLDIER: This has your name written all over it, bro. RUDY: Hope you feel comfortable. (SPEAKS GERMAN) FEMALE SOLDIERS: Thank you. MALE SOLDIER: Thank you. - (GRUNTS) Too small. - sh1t. They're already looking for us. I'm wiping our aliases off any public traffic sites now. LENNOX: Karli. We can't stay here for long. Six months ago would you have imagined people supporting the cause like this? We're not playing no more. We can't let the same assholes who were put back in power after The Blip win. The GRC care more about the people who came back than the ones who never left. We got a glimpse of how things could be. I need to know that you're all committed, because after tomorrow, there's no going back. Yeah. One world. SOLDIERS: One people. - MATIAS: One world. - SOLDIERS: One people. - One world! - SOLDIERS: One people! SAM: You all right? Let's take the shield, Sam. Let's take the shield and do this ourselves. We can't just run up on the man, beat him up, and take it. Do you remember what happened the last time we stole it? - Maybe. - I'll help you in case you forgot. Sharon was branded enemy of the state, and Steve and I were on the run for two years. I don't know about you, but I don't wanna live the rest of my life  la vida loca.   We just got our ass handed to us by Super Soldiers, and we got nothing. Not entirely true. There is someone that you should meet. - KID: Hey, it's Black Falcon. What's up? - SAM: It's just Falcon, kid. No, no. My daddy told me it's Black Falcon. Is it because I'm Black and I'm the Falcon? Well, technically, I mean, yes. So are you, like, Black kid? (SIGHS) (CHUCKLES) I got him, right? Whatever, man. (CHUCKLES) Whatever. We're here to see Isaiah. Nobody named Isaiah live here. Look, we just want to talk to him. You must not hear what I just said. You ain't getting in this house. Y'all can leave now. Tell him the guy from the bar in Goyang is here. He's gonna know what that means. All right, wait here. Nice kid. How do you know this guy? I used to. We had a skirmish during the Korean War. BOY: Today's your lucky day. He said he wanna see for himself. (OBJECT CLATTERS) Isaiah? Look at you. This is, uh, Sam. Sam, this is Isaiah. He was a hero. One of the ones that HYDRA feared the most. Like Steve. We met in '  . If by met, you mean I whupped your ass, then, yeah. We heard whispers he was on the peninsula, but everyone they sent after him, never came back. So the U.S. military dropped me behind the line to go deal with him. I took half that metal arm in that fight in Goyang, but I see he's managed to grow it back. 
 
 I just wanted to see if he got the arm back. Or if he'd come to kill me. I'm not a killer anymore. You think you can wake up one day and decide who you wanna be? It doesn't work like that. Well, maybe it does for folks like you. Isaiah, the reason we're here is because there's more of you and me out there. - You and me. - And we need to know how. I'm not gonna talk about it anymore. (LOUD CRASH) You know what they did to me for being a hero? They put my ass in jail for    years. People running tests,     taking my blood, coming into my cell. Even your people weren't done with me. - Isaiah... - Get out of my house! BOY: Let's go, man, let's go. - Sam... - Why didn't you tell me about Isaiah? How could nobody bring him up? - I asked you a question, Bucky. - I know. - Steve didn't know about him? - He didn't. I didn't tell him. So you're telling me that there was a black Super Soldier decades ago and nobody knew about it? - (CAR APPROACHING) - (SIREN WHOOPS) OFFICER: Hey. SAM: What's up, man? - Is there a problem here? - No, we're just talking. BUCKY: We're fine. OFFICER: Can I see your ID? - I don't have ID. Why? - BUCKY: Man, seriously? Okay, sir, just calm down. I am calm. What do you want? We're just standing here, talking. - Just give him your ID so we can get the hell out of here. - No, I'm not giving him sh1t. - We're just talking. - Hey, hey. Look, is this guy bothering you? No, he's not bothering me. Do you know who this is? (WHISPERS) Hey, these guys are Avengers. Oh, God, I am so sorry, Mr. Wilson. (CHUCKLES NERVOUSLY) I didn't recognize you without the goggles. I'm really, really sorry about this. - The... - (SIREN WHOOPS) Guys, (SIGHS) just wait here, okay? Just... (POLICE RADIO CHATTER) I didn't... I didn't tell anybody because he had already been through enough. OFFICER: Mr. Barnes, there's a warrant out for your arrest. Look, the president pardoned him for all that. Not for that. You missed your court-mandated therapy. It's like missing a check-in with your PO. I'm sorry, Mr. Barnes, you're under arrest. Sam. I've heard a lot about you. I'm Dr. Raynor. I'm James's therapist. So nice to meet you. Thank you for getting him out. That was not me. CAPTAIN AMERICA: Christina. It's great to see you again. You gotta be kidding me. You know him? Yeah, we did some field ops back in the day. I heard you were working with Bucky, so I thought I'd step in. Bucky's not gonna be following a strict schedule any longer. We haven't finished our work. Who authorized this? Um... He's too valuable of an asset to have tied up. So, just do whatever you got to do with him,then send him off to me. Got some unfinished business, him and I. You too, Wilson. I'll be outside. James, condition of your release, session now. You too, Sam. - That's okay. I'll be out here with... - That wasn't a request. So... Who would like to start? All right, look, Dr. Raynor? I get it, why you want me to talk to Freaky Magoo over here. But I'm    % fine. It is my job to make sure that you're okay. And so, yeah, this may be slightly unprofessional, but it's the only way that I can see if you're getting over whatever's eating at you. - This is ridiculous. - Yeah. I agree. See? Making progress already. So, who wants to go first? No volunteers? Wow. How surprising. Okay. We're going to do an exercise. It's something I use with couples when they are trying to figure out what kind of life they wanna build together. Are you familiar with the miracle question? - Absolutely not. - Of course not. DR. RAYNOR: Okay, it goes like this. Suppose that while you're sleeping, a miracle occurs. When you wake up,     what is something that you would like to see that would make your life better? In my miracle, he would... he would talk less. Exactly what I was gonna say. Isn't that ironic? You guys are leaving me with no choice. It's time for the soul-gazing exercise. - I like this one better. - Oh, God. He's gonna love this. - Yeah, I'm ready. - SAM: This is right up your alley. DR. RAYNOR: Turn around. Face each other. You should really enjoy this. I'm going to. - SAM: I know you are. - Yeah. - DR. RAYNOR: Sam. Face each other. - BUCKY: Let's do it. Let's stare. - Get close. - This is a good exercise. Thanks, Doc. All right, good. All right, get close. Come on, a little closer. Which way you want to go? - Right or left? - Do you have to have your legs open? You know what? Fine. Here. You happy now? - All right. - All right. - Good. Fine. - We're locked in. - That's a little close. - Very close. That's what you wanted, right? DR. RAYNOR: Guys. Good. Now look at each other. You need to look at each other in the eyes. There, you see? That wasn't so hard. Wait, what are you doing? Are you having a staring contest? Just blink. (SNAPS FINGERS) Sweet Jesus. All right, James, why does Sam aggravate you? And don't say something childish. Why did you give up that shield? Why are you making such a big deal out of something that has nothing to do with you? Steve believed in you. He trusted you. He gave you that shield for a reason. That shield, that is... that is everything he stood for. That is his legacy. He gave you that shield, and you threw it away like it was nothing. - SAM: Shut up. - So maybe he was wrong about you. And if he was wrong about you, then he was wrong about me. You finished? - Yeah. - SAM: All right, good. Maybe this is something you or Steve will never understand. But can you accept that I did what I thought was right? (SCOFFS) You know what, Doc? I don't have time for this. We have some real serious sh1t going on. So how about this? I will squash it right now. We go deal with that, and when we're done, we both can go on separate, long vacations and never see each other again. - I like that. - Great. Well, let's get to work. Thanks, Doc, for making it weird. I feel much better. I'll see you outside. DR. RAYNOR: Thank you. That was really great. (DOOR OPENS AND CLOSES) I know that look. What's wrong? What was rule number two again? Don't hurt anyone. Goodbye, Doc. Well, I feel better. - I feel awful. - (SIREN WHOOPING) Gentlemen. Good to see you again. Look, if we divide ourselves, we don't stand a chance, you guys know that. So what do you got? CAPTAIN AMERICA: Well, the leader's name's Karli Morgenthau. We've been targeting civilians who've been helping Karli move from place to place. They geotagged a location, then scrambled the signal. But our satellites have found their symbol popping up in various displaced communities all across Central and Eastern Europe. We think that she's taking the medicine she just stole to one of these camps. Well, there are hundreds of those all over the planet since The Blip. So I guess you'll have to look real hard. Good thing I have   /   vision, huh? Where is she now, Walker? Do you know? (VOICE RISES) No, we don't know, Bucky. It's only a matter of time before we find out. Things are really intense for you, aren't they, Walker? Take it easy. Look, Walker's right. It is imperative that we find them and stop them. But you guys have rules of engagement and all kind of authorizations you have to get. We're free agents. We're more flexible. So it wouldn't make sense for us to work with you. A word of advice, then. Stay the hell out of my way. (CELL PHONE VIBRATING) Damn it! We gotta move out now. - They found us. - How much time do we have? None. It's The Power Broker's men. Everybody, grab what you can. I can give you time. I'll hold them off. KARLI: Thank you. One world. One people. NICO: Let's go! - (GRUNTS) - AGENT: All right, stop right there. Freeze! Hit him, open fire. - (GUNFIRE) - (GRUNTS) (SIGHS) They got away. So what are you thinking? Well, I know what we have to do. When Isaiah said "my people"... Oh, don't take that to heart. That's not what he meant. No, he meant HYDRA. HYDRA used to be my people. (SCOFFS) Not a chance. Walker doesn't have any leads. I know where you're going with this, no. He knows all of HYDRA's secrets. Don't you remember Siberia? So you're just gonna go sit in a room with this guy? (HESITATES) Yes. Okay, then. We're gonna go see Zemo.
