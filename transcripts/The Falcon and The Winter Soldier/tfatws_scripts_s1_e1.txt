 (MUSIC PLAYING) 
 (BIRDS CHIRPING) 
 STEVE:  How does it feel?   
 SAM:  Like it's someone else's.   
 STEVE:  It isn't.   
 (UPLIFTING MUSIC PLAYING) 
 MAJOR:  The criminal organization known as LAF  is targeting Captain Vasant, one of our military liaisons. 
 - SAM: LAF? 
 - Yeah, they're high-powered. 
 We lost contact with Vasant's plane just after it took off. 
 We need you to make sure that LAF doesn't deliver on their threat. 
 Vasant's plane has already entered Tunisian airspace. 
 US military cannot be seen operating out there. 
 I got it. 
 You guys fly low, drop me off, I fly up to intercept. 
 No treaties violated. 
 First Lieutenant Torres, our intel officer, will be helping on the ground. 
 And Sam, this has to be subtle. 
 Subtle. 
 Got it. 
 Sam, Torres here. 
 Sending intel to your HUD right now. 
 I'll be your boots on the ground, sir.   
 I got eyes on a plane. 
 Any sign of LAF? 
 TORRES:  Nah. 
 Nothing yet. 
 But I'll keep tracking the chatter. (PROPELLERS ROARING) They've already hijacked the plane. Oh, we're gonna need to call some people. (SPEAKING FRENCH) (FALCON IN ENGLISH) Okay, switching to plan B. (BOTH GRUNTING) GEORGES: Hey! (SPEAKING FRENCH) - (GRUNTING) - (MAN SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY) (FALCON IN ENGLISH) Redwing, engage. (PULSING) (VASANT GROANS) (BEEPS) (GRUNTS) - (GRUNTS) - (SCREAMS) (ALL GRUNTING) (SCREAMS) (BULLETS RICOCHETING) (ENGINE WHIRRING) (BEEPING) Captain Vasant? Let's get you out of here. (GRUNTS) (BOTH GRUNTING) (GEORGES YELLS) (BOTH GRUNTING) Sam? (VASANT SCREAMS) Oh! (LAUGHS) (VASANT SCREAMS) (GUNSHOTS) (MAN SCREAMS) (GRUNTS) (HELICOPTER APPROACHING) (MACHINE GUN FIRING) Redwing, get 'em off our ass! (MAN SCREAMS) (EXPLOSION) (FALCON GRUNTS) (MAN GRUNTING) (GRUNTS) Keep going! We're close! If we get to the border, he's not gonna follow. (CLICKING) - What's up? - (GRUNTS) - (GUNSHOTS) - (GRUNTS) - (SCREAMS) - (GRUNTS) (SCREAMS) No! (GRUNTS) - (BEEPS) - (EXPLOSION) (BEEPING) All right, heads up! You're about to fly into Libyan airspace. FALCON: And I assume they have a problem with that. Yeah, yeah. A big problem. A big problem. - FALCON: How long I got? - TORRES:  Ninety seconds.   (BEEPS) (HELICOPTER HOVERING) Aw, sh1t. He's outnumbered. (EXPLOSIONS) (GRUNTS) (GRUNTS) Sam, we gotta fall back! We got to call it off! We gotta find another way! (BEEPS) I just did. (SPEAKING FRENCH) (GRUNTS) Merde!   (SCREAMS) (CHEERS) Whoo! Yeah! (INDISTINCT CHATTER) - (SAM IN ENGLISH) Thanks. - (TORRES SIGHS) You could try to reroute that to the other... Hey, could you not? Oh. (CHUCKLES) I've been working with the Air Force for six months now. Every time ops touches him, he gets all glitchy. Well, you know, those poor techs can't keep up with a billion returning IP addresses    - and your sick-ass Stark-level tech. - (BOTH CHUCKLE) MAN: Hey, Avengers. (SPEAKING ARABIC) (IN ENGLISH) He knows Arabic. Wait, can you say that again? Hold on a sec. - All right. Come on. - (BOTH CHUCKLE) TORRES: Anyway, these LAF crews, man, they're tryin' to take advantage of all the chaos and make some money. And that I get, but there's... (BEEPS) Oh, bam! Right there! You see these guys? These're guys you gotta worry about. I've been stumbling onto their manifestos on message boards. They call themselves the Flag Smashers. Is that a new thing? Bad guys give themselves bad names. There's a lot worse names than that one. But basically, they think that the world was better during The Blip. Trust me, it wasn't. Trust me. Every time something gets better for one group, it gets worse for another. Yeah. Essentially, these people, they want a world that's unified without borders. So, you could see why a lot of people are into that. Yeah, but keep an eye on it. If anything gets serious, you let me know. No doubt. I'll... I'll, uh... I'll track the online chatter, see what they're saying. Yeah. I do gotta ask you, though, 'cause online there's just been a lot of stuff about Steve, actually. Um, crazy, crazy conspiracy theories. So, some people... Some people, they think that he's in a secret base on the moon looking down over us. Yeah. Well, I can assure you, those people, you don't have to take seriously. But you didn't, like... (IMITATES FLYING SOUND) Fly him to the moon? - Nah. - Oh... Had to check. Oh, oh, I got you, man. - Thanks. I'll get you back next time. - All right. - So, where are you off to? - Washington. What are you doin' there? Moon stuff. Oh! SAM: Steve represented the best in all of us. Courageous, righteous, hopeful. And he mastered posing stoically. (ALL CHUCKLE) The world has been forever changed. (CAMERA SHUTTER CLICKING) A few months ago, billions of people reappeared after five years away, sending the world into turmoil. We need new heroes. Ones suited for the times we're in. Symbols... are nothing without the women and men that give them meaning. And this thing... (CHUCKLES) (CAMERA SHUTTER CLICKING) I don't know if there's ever been a greater symbol. But it's more about the man who propped it up, and he's gone. So, today we honor Steve's legacy. But also, we look to the future. So, thank you, Captain America. But this belongs to you. (APPLAUSE) MAN:  Thanks again for coming forward with the shield, Sam.   It was the right decision. Take a walk? SAM:  Yeah, I've been at home.   My sister and my nephews, man. When I left, they were babies. I come back and they're little men. - It's crazy, you know? - Yeah. Well, you should bring 'em out to D.C. sometime. I'll teach 'em how to fly. - You know, I mean, the right way. - (SAM CHUCKLES) RHODES: Crazy to think that nobody's gonna be carryin' the shield. SAM: Hey, we went for    years without anybody carryin' it when Steve was on ice. So, I think we'll be all right. RHODES: That was a different time, Sam. I see you're gonna make me ask. Why didn't you take up the mantle? When Steve first told me about the shield, the first words I said were, "It feels like it belongs to someone else". Hmm. That someone else is Steve. RHODES: World's a crazy place right now. People are... Well, nobody's stable. Allies are now enemies. Alliances are all torn apart. The world's broken. Everybody's just looking for somebody to fix it. SAM: Yeah. It's a new day, brother. I'll be in touch. (LAUGHS) I mean... Thank you. - Oh... Well, that's done. - WOMAN: Yeah. Half hour before last call? I can't, guys. I have to prep for tomorrow's session. - Really? - You... Ooh! (CHUCKLES) (GRUNTS) (SCREAMS) (GRUNTS) (SPEAKING RUSSIAN) (GUNS FIRING) (GROANS) (GRUNTS) Hail HYDRA. (CHOKING) (FAINT RATTLING) MAN: sh1t. (BREATH TREMBLING) MAN: Please. (PANTING) (STUTTERS) I didn't see anything. I didn't see anything. I didn't see anything. (GUNSHOT) (BREATHING HEAVILY) DR. RAYNOR:  So, Mr. Barnes, are you still having nightmares?   James, I asked you a question. Are you still having nightmares? No. We've been doing this long enough that I can tell when you're lying. Well, you seem a little off today. Did something happen recently? No. You're a civilian now. With your history, the government needs to know that you're not gonna... It's a condition of your pardon. So, tell me about your most recent nightmare. I didn't have a nightmare. (BREATHES DEEPLY) BUCKY: Oh, come on. Really? You're gonna do the notebook thing? Why? It's passive aggressive. You don't talk. I write. (SIGHS) Okay. Okay. I crossed a name off the list of my amends yesterday. Don't worry. I used all your three rules. Senator Atwood. She was a HYDRA pawn for years.   Helped her get into office when I was the Winter Soldier.   (BEEPS) BUCKY:  And after HYDRA disbanded,  she continued to abuse the power I gave her. ATWOOD:  Make this go away.   If Congressman Lockhart wants to speak up,     silence him for good. So, rule number one, you can't do anything illegal. (ENGINE STARTS) What the hell? (TIRES SCREECH) BUCKY:  All I did was give some intel to the aide to convict her.   And I wasn't involved in anything else. (TIRES SCREECHING) (SOBS) Rule number two? What was rule number two? Nobody gets hurt. It's a big one. Then why isn't it rule number one? I didn't hurt anybody. Come on! BUCKY: Remember me? I promise. (GRUNTING) DR. RAYNOR: And what about rule number three? The whole point of making amends is to fulfill rule number three. You know, you're a cynic, Doc. Of course, I completed rule number three. I am no longer the Winter Soldier. I am James Bucky Barnes... And you're part of my efforts to make amends. (SIRENS APPROACHING) (BREATHING HEAVILY) DR. RAYNOR:  So, you did it all right,   but it didn't help with the nightmares.   Well, like I said, I didn't have any. Look... one day, you're gonna have to open up and understand that some people really do want to help you and that they can be trusted. I trust people. Yeah? Give me your phone. (BUCKY GROANS) (DIGITAL BEEPING) You don't have ten phone numbers on this thing. (BEEPING CONTINUES) Oh, and you've been ignoring the texts from Sam. (SMACKS LIPS) Look, you've gotta nurture friendships. I am the only person you have called all week. - That is so sad. - (THUDS) You're alone. You're a hundred years old. You have no history, no family... Are you lashing out at me, Doc? Because that's really unprofessional, you know? I mean, when did that start? When did you start yelling at your clients? Oh, the notebook. That's great. (SIGHS) All right, give me a break. I'm trying, okay? This isn't... (SIGHS) This is new for me. I didn't have a moment to deal with anything, you know? I had a little... calm in Wakanda. And other than that, I just went from one fight to another for    years. So, now that you've stopped fighting, what do you want? Peace. That is utter bullshit. You're a terrible shrink. I was an excellent soldier, so I saw a lot of dead bodies, and I know how that can shut you down. And if you are alone, that is the quietest, most personal hell. And, James, it is very hard to escape. Look, I know that you have been through a lot, but you've got your mind back, you are being pardoned. I mean, these are good things. You're free. To do what? (CARS HONKING) Hey, hey, hey! Hey! What? What? Your can isn't even half full. Why don't we just share? YORI: What're you talking about? UNIQUE: Okay. You don't gotta body me, Yori. - YORI: It's Mr. Nakajima. - UNIQUE: Okay. - Mr. Nakajima! - Okay. - Mr. Nakajima. - Hey! Hey! Yori, what's goin' on? I thought we're getting lunch. Unique is putting his trash    - into my trash. - It's trash. - And the time has come for me to smack... - Whoa! - It's just trash. - Hang on. Hey, man. I'm Unique. It's like Monique, but it's got a "U" in there for uniqueness. - That's absurd. - Okay, sorry. Yori, you can't keep fighting with your neighbors. - Come on, let's get some food. - No, go away. But Izzy. We always go to Izzy on Wednesday. - I'm not in the mood today. - Hey, what if I buy? YORI: Fine, but no talking. (THUNDER RUMBLING) Take a look. Nobody made it past this week. So young. Such a shame. You guys didn't order the usual, huh? Feeling a little adventurous? You should ask her out. Mm-mmm... He would like to take you out on a date. Maybe to bingo or a night of pinochle? Pinochle. Yeah. - I'm really sorry about him. - Why are you sorry? - I'm game. - Wow. - Tomorrow night, then? - Tomorrow night's great. (CHUCKLES) Just maybe not pinochle. - What's wrong with pinochle? - Yeah. I have a shift, but if you wanna come back here, I should be done around   :  . I can't believe you did that. It's a dance to these things. You can't... You gotta warm up and I haven't danced since     ... it feels like. What's wrong? (SPEAKING JAPANESE) (IN ENGLISH) Um... (SIGHS) He had a job with a consulting company. And, uh, he was working abroad and he was killed. The police said "Wrong place, wrong time", but... I will never know what really happened to him. I felt it was strange. In here. This, too, Mom? SARAH: Yeah, all of it, baby. And we're taking that one to the soup kitchen. So, put that one over there. Blue for the snapper, orange for the whitefish. BOY: Uncle Sam! What's up? SARAH: That's right! Uncle Sam, you're back early. What's goin' on? You got Mom's sneaky look on your face. How you gonna try to read me when you know I'm the one that reads you? You gotta marvel at it. Baby being held together by duct tape and prayers. It'll be fine. It just needs to float long enough for me to sell it. I thought we were gonna discuss if we were selling it. SARAH: We did. And then you were off fighting Doctor Space Cape or whatever while I was holdin' it together for five long years. Now that the world is going back to normal, this thing's gotta go. We grew up on this thing. It's not just Mom and Dad's name on it, Sarah. This thing is a part of our family. You know the situation we're in. This is why I prefer not to dwell on it in front of everybody. Well, what if we don't have to sell it? Can I talk to you? - MAN: What's good, Big Sam? - Oh! What's goin' on, man? - I'm trying to live like you. - MAN: You know it. (CHUCKLES) - Off to save the world again? - Nah. Come on, Carlos. I'm around here more than you. I'm always reppin' NOLA. MAN: When you gonna let me borrow the wings, man? SAM: As soon as you give my sister back that $    you borrowed. - MAN: That's cold. Now, loan me a hot $  . - SAM: Yeah. I'll loan you $  . - Sam, the boat's gotta go. - SAM: Wait. No, let me finish. I'm doin' everything I can to keep this business afloat. And every day I'm making $ , and spending $  . - So, why won't you let me help? - No, don't start with that. We made a deal before Daddy died. You're out there. I do things my way here. Right. But you tangled the house into this when you took those loans. (GROANS) Forgot how hard you hit. Sarah! Look, and don't hit me again. What if you had money to fix it up, make it nice so you can charter it when you're not out working the waters? Do you know how hard it was for me to come to terms with the situation? Why would you dig this up? We can take a loan and consolidate everything. It'll take down your monthly. 
 
 - What? - You think I didn't try the banks? They're in with all that big business. Yeah. But now you have me. Don't, Sam. - I just got good with this. - All right. Maybe it is time for us to move on. Either way, just let me help. I'll set the appointment. Look, I won't let you down. We can turn this sh1t around. Trust me. To the rescue? Always. Now, let's get some dinner. I'm hungry. (SIREN WAILS) (DOOR OPENS) (DOOR CLOSES) WOMAN: Well, if that's not the most adorably old-fashioned thing anyone's ever done. Grab a seat, I'll be done in a few. BUCKY: Okay. So, have you dated much since half the fish in the sea came back? BUCKY: Not really. I, um... tried the whole online dating thing. It's pretty crazy. A lot of weird pictures. What kind of weird? I mean, tiger photos? Half the time I don't even know what I'm looking at. It's... It's a lot. (CHUCKLES) You sound like my dad. Mmm... Wait, how old are you? A hundred and six. (BOTH LAUGH) What's up with your gloves? BUCKY: I, um... have, uh... (CLICKS TONGUE) Poor circulation. WOMAN: Hmm... - Let's play a game. - Yeah. - You like games? - Love 'em. We keep a couple of games around for boring shifts. I'll go grab a couple of beers. What are you doing? I'm reading your mind. Please don't. B- , sucker. - Uh, hit! - (CHUCKLES) - Drink! Come on, drink. - (BUCKY SIGHS) All right. Okay. Wow, you really can drink. (INHALES) Yeah, well... Do you have any siblings? I have a sister. F- . Miss. Drink. Are you close with your parents? (SIGHS) I was. They passed away. (CLICKS TONGUE) Um, D- . Oh, I'm sorry. Um, miss. I think it's really sweet you're spending time with Yori. It's been hard for him his son died. I think not knowing how it happened is the hardest part for him. Mmm, it really messed him up. You know how you call a guy whose wife died a widower? Or, if your parents die, you're an orphan. You know, there's no word for someone whose kids die. Because it's like the worst thing that could happen. Yeah, excuse me. You good? (KNOCK ON DOOR) (DOOR OPENS) Hey, what are you doing here? How was the date? It was... It was good. Forgot I owed you for lunch. (BIRDS CHIRPING) SAM: There we go. Get the plates moving. Get some rice in there. Come on. SARAH: Oh, lined up perfectly. You always gotta do the most, huh? You know, I don't play with these White folks. (CHUCKLES) Look, I know you're worried, all right? But I did the research. I ran the numbers. - You really think this is gonna work? - I know it will. And then we can renovate the kitchen. Now, you said you wanted to sell plates on the weekends, right? That's great. You can introduce some of Grandma's recipes and... sh1t. We gotta go. Wait, the appointment's in an hour. There's no such thing as on time. You're either early or late. Pick one. Okay. Now you're really doing more than the most. All right, boys, I love you. Now, Mr. Liu's gonna watch over you and no video games. - Love you. Bye. - Bye. BOTH: Yes, video games. (SAM CHUCKLES) - Three, two, one. - (DOOR SLAMS) Go, go, go! (INDISTINCT CHATTER) (SPEAKING GERMAN) (DISTANT WHISTLING) (INDISTINCT CHATTER) (CELL PHONE BEEPS) (GLASS BREAKING) (CROWD CLAMORING) (ALARM RINGING) (SPEAKING GERMAN) (WOMAN PANTING) (TORRES IN ENGLISH) He's getting away! (GRUNTS) TORRES: Sorry. Uh... (SPEAKING GERMAN) (INDISTINCT CHATTER) (BOTH GRUNTING) - (MAN SCREAMS) - (GRUNTS) (IN ENGLISH) Hey, hey, hey! I don't know how jurisdiction works here, but I'mma have to place you under arrest. (GROANS) (BOTH GRUNTING) (GROANS) - (MAN GRUNTS) - (GROANS) Sorry, I keep thinking. Did you used to play for LSU? - (CHUCKLES) - Do I know you from somewhere? I don't know. Do you? I do. But where? Come on. - I knew it. Falcon! - Yeah! (LAUGHS) Yes! Yes! Man! (CHUCKLING) Oh... I didn't want to say anything. You know... I always wanted to be an Avenger. Oh, man, it's a dream come true, you know? (CHUCKLES) That's amazing. Like, keeping my family's business afloat by changin' to a fishin' and charter model. You know what I've always wondered... How do you guys make a living? You mean, those guys or the guy sitting in front of you tryin' to get a loan? Both. (CHUCKLES) I mean, your financials are all over the place. Is there some kind of fund for heroes? Or did Stark pay you when he was around? My condolences, by the way. Thank you, but no, it doesn't really work like that. There's a tremendous amount of goodwill and because of that, people are inclined to help,     - which applies to the business. - Yeah, right. But were you living off of goodwill this whole time? I don't get what you're going for here. Are you trying to help us, or indict us? You have no income over the last five years. How can you have income if you don't exist? SAM: Sarah. Uh... (STUTTERS) I've been gone like several billion other people. But if you look at our plan, I have government contracts, so, that's proof of earnings. And I know for a fact that we qualify for a SBA loan. Under the old terms, sure. But these days, what, with everyone just showing up, well, things tightened up. Funny how things always tighten around us. Whoa. Easy there. Look,     I'm on your side. After all, he's a hero. Is there any chance, and of course you could say "no", that I could get a selfie with your arms out? - Are you serious? - (LAUGHS) Mr. Wilson, Mrs. Wilson... Miss. I'm a widow. Ms. Wilson. I know your family has banked with us for generations, but we cannot approve you. I'm truly sorry. We're gonna get that loan. I don't care if I have to go to every bank in the city. Sam, stop! I don't want to deal with this again. That's what life is, dealing with things. You are so out of pocket for that. Don't forget, you joined the Air Force. You didn't see everything Mom and Daddy dealt with. I knew they weren't gonna help us. It's not their job. Those people don't even know who Daddy was, and he was a giant. I don't care. I'm not gonna quit. What are you trying to prove? And who you trying to prove it to? - I swear, after Daddy died... - See, I knew that was gonna come up. I never hid what I thought. You had to go off and fight armies and monsters. And I appreciate that, but you don't get to come back here and try to right your wrongs just because you couldn't deal with what was going on here. You don't know what happened these last five years. I was alone with two babies and I survived. I'm the one who kept that boat from sinkin'. Yeah, well, half the boat's mine and so is the house. We're not sellin' our family's legacy. You gonna do me like that when you know I'm right? SAM: Yep! (BIRDS CHIRPING) Okay. (PIPES CREAKING) (SIGHS) Oh! (EXHALES) Come on, baby. What you got for me? (ENGINE SPUTTERS) Come on! Come on! (ENGINE SPUTTERS) sh1t! (WATER SPLASHING) (BOAT CREAKING) (CELL PHONE DINGS) (DINGS) (KEYBOARD CLACKING) SAM: So, this is the leader of the Flag Smashers, huh? Yeah, real nice guy.   I thought you were supposed to be monitoring them online. I was. I did. But you know sometimes you gotta get your hands dirty, - or a broken orbital. - (SAM SCOFFS) You're lucky that's all you got. He's strong. He was. I mean, bro, they went dark as soon as it was all over. But that's their M.O. We just gotta keep our eyes and ears to the ground till they pop up again. Anything else happen outside the video? No, man. My face was in the dirt before I knew what was happening. Why? What are you thinking? Nothin'. Wait. You don't think he could be a... Look, I'll circle back to you. - Let's keep this between me and you, okay? - TORRES:  All right.   SARAH: Oh, my God, Sam. You better look at this. (MAN ON TV) Unrest, in the wake of recent events   has left us vulnerable.   Every day Americans feel it.   While we love heroes who put their lives   on the line to defend Earth,   we also need a hero to defend this country.   We need a real person who embodies America's greatest values. We need someone to inspire us again,   someone who can be a symbol for all of us.   So, on behalf of the Department of Defense   and our Commander-in-Chief,   it is with great honor that we announce here today   that the United States of America has a new hero.   Join me in welcoming your new Captain America. (ALL CHEERING) (MUSIC PLAYING)
