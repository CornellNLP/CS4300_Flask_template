 He's a gentleman, isn't he? 
 So, what do you say? 
 How do, sir? 
 Too many questions. 
 A young girl has come to me for protection. 
 I need somewhere to place her. 
 I have promised Mr Marlott that I will look after you. 
 It's not his, though, is it? 
 Please help me. 
 Frankenstein? 
 Contains references to Galvanism, sir. 
 Do you know much about it? 
 Not my subject, I am afraid. 
 What brings you here, Mr Marlott? 
 A crime I am investigating. 
 The missing girl? 
 Yes, and others. 
 Get some clothes. We are leaving immediately. 
 I'll find the killers for you, I swear. 
 So, why didn't you? 
 I'm scared of them. 
 The man you are looking for, I think I have found a way to get to him. 
 Billy the childcatcher. 
 That's my guess. 
 Is that where he is? 
 Woman : Oh, he don't like our perfume. 
 Why don't you show yourself? 
 No orders from you. 
 We do the carving down here. 
 All right. 
 Take off them gloves. 
 Those fingers. He ain't no surgeon. 
 Then what's he want with a corpse? 
 He asked you a question. 
 Company. That's why he's needing fresh. 
 (LAUGHTER) 
 Woman : Company? 
 Boy or girl? 
 Girl, of course. 
 No offence, I'm sure. 
 How old? 
 16. 
 Or less. 
 30 guineas. Up front. 
 35 guineas. 20 up front. The rest when you deliver. 
 On one condition. 
 I get to choose. 
 He's lying. It's a trick. 
 No trick. 35 guineas for the girl of my choice! 
 Someone in mind, have you? 
 Not yet, no. But I'll know when I see her. 
 Too risky. 
 Gut him now. 
 The surgeons will do you out of business, but I know others who want what I want. 
 You do right by me, your trade's secure. 
 9:00 tomorrow night. At the Fortune. 
 So no sign of Billy, then? 
 No. 
 Then maybe he ain't the one we are looking for. 
 Billy took Alice. 
 That much we know. 
 Just because he isn't down there doesn't mean he isn't doing business with them. 
 He may have been supplying children. 
 So Billy stole them, then they stitched the pieces together. 
 Possible. 
 They deal in corpses. I dare say they are not scrupled about how they use them. 
 Either that or they are both working for someone else. 
 You've cut yourself, sir. 
 Eh? 
 Always had leather hands. 
 God help us. 
 It's not blood, like paint. 
 Pure gatherer. Where is he? 
 Someone let out after you went in. 
 It must have been him. Cutting his losses. 
 Where is he? How do I find him? 
 Why? 
 Why? 
 If he can lead us to them, we don't have to go through with this. 
 He ain't gonna peach, not on that mob. 
 He sells down the tonners' yard. Borough. 
 Where it stinks worse than they do. 
 Maybe that's how he knows them. 
 They live there? Or somewhere else the smell of death goes undetected. 
 You're a death dealer. Think. 
 How could a crew like that go to ground? 
 Makes no odds to me cos I ain't looking for them nowhere. 
 Aye? Well, wait for them to come looking for you, then. And they will. 
 Once they realise we are not buyers for real. 
 Or you can meet me here with them tomorrow night. 
 Do what? 
 Catch them in the act. 
 What, you think they are just going to walk in here and carve someone up? 
 35 guineas is too much to pass up, even for that lot. 
 We need a girl as bait and 20 guineas. 
 Who's got that kind of coin? 
 You wouldn't? 
 I will. 
 If you don't find them first, I'll get your friend to do likewise. 
 If you want to keep your savings, you'll find Barkiss before tomorrow night. 
 Please let me stay here with you. 
 Do you know the trouble I went to on your behalf? 
 He gave me this for you. 
 "Dear Mr Marlott, the girl lost her child and would not be persuaded to stay. She asks to lodge with you. Pease join us today for lunch at one and we can discuss further. Yours, Daniel Hervey." 
 It was nice. 
 Please don't throw me out, sir. 
 I feel safe here. 
 Oh, Agnes. 
 Forgive me. 
 Anyone seen Barkiss? 
 Who? 
 Walks with a stoop. 
 There's a farthing in it for you if I can find him. 
 (KIDS SHOUT) 
 I seen him, mister. 
 And me! 
 Where? When? 
 He was here yesterday. 
 He comes every week. 
 Do you know where he lives? 
 Dunno, Mr. If it's fresh you want, I can get you bucketloads. 
 (DOOR) 
 Sir? 
 Sir? 
 (LAUGHS) 
 Hello, girl. 
 What do you want? 
 To see you. 
 Settled... nice and snug. 
 How did you find me? 
 Magic. 
 Did he take it you? 
 Or did you sell it to him? 
 What? 
 Your little thing. 
 Go away, Bill! Leave me be. 
 (HE LAUGHS) 
 That's harsh, innit? 
 After all our days together. 
 Very well. You be that way. 
 Why can't you just leave me be? 
 Cos you're mine and I still got a use for you. 
 Now... Not a word of this, you hear? 
 Yeah. 
 I get wind that you said owt, I'll be back. 
 And I'll slit you up. 
 All the way down to you know where. 
 Mr Marlott for Lord Hervey. 
 Mr Marlott, my Lord. 
 Thank you for coming. 
 Bentley, this is Mr Marlott... 
 Yes, we meet. 
 Please. 
 I won't stay to dine. 
 But I'd like to thank you for your invitation. 
 At least sit with us for a while. 
 Lloris, take Mr Marlott's hat and gloves. 
 Sir. 
 How is the girl? 
 Weary. 
 After what happened. 
 Mr Marlott has taken a charitable interest in a young girl who is with child. 
 Sadly, she miscarried last night. 
 There was nothing I could have done. I'm afraid. 
 It was her clear intention that the child not be born. 
 The body answered to the will. 
 I have seen it many times. 
 Was she unmarried? 
 I am afraid so. 
 Well, then it was an act of provenance. 
 Or a blessing in disguise. 
 Don't believe that, Daniel. 
 Suffer the little children and forbid them not to come unto me. 
 For such is the kingdom of heaven. 
 Our earthly realm is less benign, however. 
 Whatever her prospects, they would have been bleaker still with a b*st*rd. 
 Harsh words. 
 Come on, company. 
 Lord Hervey : Maybe so but true nonetheless. 
 You're leaving us, Mr Marlott. 
 Forgive me. 
 My Lord, may I talk to you in private for a moment? 
 Of course Excuse us. 
 I am truly sorry about the girl, but she would not be persuaded to stay. 
 And it's against my principles to act against the will of a patient. 
 That's not what I wish to talk about, my Lord. 
 Your condition? 
 No, my Lord. 
 Galvanism. 
 Galvanism? 
 What of it? 
 You said it was Sir William's speciality. 
 He wrote his doctoral thesis on the subject. I read it. 
 Why? 
 When we spoke together about it, he denied it. 
 He might well. 
 It was highly controversial. 
 In what way? 
 The Galvanists believed they had found the source of all life. 
 And had they? 
 No, they had discovered bioelectrical currents in the human anatomy. 
 But their claim caused outrage in some quarters as you might imagine. 
 The likes of Sir Bentley, for instance. 
 And yourself? 
 My objections are scientific not religious. 
 But why your interest? 
 Can you tell me more? 
 I am afraid not but my thanks, all the same. 
 And for what you tried to do for the girl. 
 Well, then, perhaps you'll allow me to examine your hand. 
 How long have you been taking mercury? 
 Almost a week now. 
 It brings hallucinations, as you know. 
 But then so does the disease. 
 You're fortunate it hasn't invaded the central nervous system yet. 
 My treatment tastes foul. 
 I don't understand how it works yet. 
 But it hardly matters. 
 Three drops. Three times a day. 
 When it runs out, I'll give you more if need be. 
 You won't mention this? 
 I treat all my patients in absolute confidence. 
 Nor my other business. 
 You have my word. Will you rejoin us? 
 No, thank you. 
 I am sorry to hear it. 
 I'll have Lloris bring your hat and gloves. 
 Mr Marlott. 
 I wanted to say goodbye. 
 Thank you. 
 I hope you won't take my brother's words amiss. 
 He speaks his mind, my lady. 
 One of the qualities I love most in him. 
 But it makes him enemies. 
 He isn't a politician like Bentley. 
 Nor I, my lady. 
 Boz. Funny name. 
 Nom de plume. 
 Pen name. Simple and memorable. 
 What will you have, sir? 
 None of that piss. 
 Stay out, please, darling. 
 So, what's this about? 
 Story I was hoping you might confirm. 
 The Runners are being wound up and Sir Robert drawing up plans for a professional police force. 
 (SNIFFS) 
 That's confirmation, I take it. 
 You can take that how you like. 
 I've heard he already has a man in your office. 
 Marlott? 
 First name. 
 Judas, for all I know. 
 Tell me about him. 
 I've asked every tanner and skin trader in the Borough. 
 Barkiss ain't been there all day. 
 I've been east to Bethnal and north to Somers Town. 
 Time to get your money out of the bank before it closes? 
 Without Barkiss, we've got no choice. We'll need three runners. 
 Armed. 
 And a girl. 
 Flora's back so we can use her. 
 Back? Sir, she's with child. 
 Not any more. Since when? 
 Last night. How? 
 She miscarried, I am told. 
 There's girls aplenty on the streets that we can use. 
 There's no time! She's ours! She's here! 
 We'll use her. Fetch her from our lodgings and prime her on the way. 
 You! With me! 
 Sorry but I can't be of service on this occasion, Mr Marlott. 
 All my men are occupied tonight. 
 Three runners? 
 Surely you can spare that for the Home Secretary's sake? 
 There is nothing I wouldn't spare for the sake of that man. 
 If only it were in my power. 
 And who has the power here more than you? 
 You tell me, Mr Marlott. 
 Sir Robert will hear of this. 
 Of that, I have no doubt. 
 Flora! 
 Flora? 
 (SHE WEEPS) 
 Why didn't you answer me? 
 
 
 
 What's this for? 
 I'm scared. 
 Of what? 
 I thought I heard someone. I was wrong. 
 What happened? Nothing. 
 I thought I heard a noise, I told you. 
 The child, I mean. 
 I lost it. 
 How? 
 I just lost it. 
 You're lying. 
 You never wanted it in the first place. 
 He helped you get rid of it, didn't he? 
 Didn't he? What's it to you? 
 That child's fate could have been yours or mine. 
 Better if it hadn't been. 
 Our boss wants to see you. 
 What does Mr Marlott want? 
 Look, I don't like it but here it is. 
 He is out to catch someone and you're his bait. 
 He is to pick you out from a crowd at Smithfield like you was fancy. 
 Whoever comes to take you away, I am to follow and make an arrest. 
 For a tup. 
 They don't plan to tup you, Flora. 
 They plan to kill you. 
 Wish you'd stayed in that hospital now, don't you? 
 Where are the others? 
 Ah, it's just the three of us. 
 And this. The others are otherwise engaged. 
 I won't let you do it, sir. 
 I mean, just us against God knows who. 
 Look at her. She can barely stand. 
 Why not ask her? 
 Who is it I'm baiting? 
 Billy. 
 And whoever he is passing children on to. 
 Just yesterday she was with child herself. 
 Now I ain't. 
 I'm ready. 
 They ain't coming. 
 Maybe not in person. But they'll show their hand somehow. 
 You can sit here as long as you like but I am going home. 
 You stay where you are. 
 What takes your fancy, sir? 
 Not you. 
 What about you, sir? 
 Girl under 16 maybe? 
 Who sent you? 
 Someone who said you would pay a pretty penny. 
 (COINS JINGLE) 
 Let's find you an angel, then. 
 I'll have her. 
 My friend wants to take us to a party. 
 Where are we going? 
 Oxford Arms. Room under the name of Shepherd. 
 Meet you there. 
 Let's get you ready, then. 
 Come on, sir. 
 (GROAN) 
 (BANGING) Slag! 
 Slag, they're here! 
 No tail? 
 (SHE CRIES OUT) 
 Gentleman paid? 
 Please. No. 
 Well, then. 
 No, please! 
 (FLORA SCREAMS) 
 No, please! Please, no! 
 No! Please! No! 
 (SCREAMING) 
 (SCREAMING AND BANGING) 
 Shut up! 
 (BANGING AND YELLING) 
 (DOOR SLAMS) 
 The childcatcher. 
 Has he got my money? 
 Get me some rope. 
 Where have they taken her? 
 He ain't talking. 
 Where? 
 He said, where? 
 Brick dust. 
 That's what was on our hands, red brick dust. 
 The brick kilns. Nova Scotia Gardens. 
 If you want to see your money again, you'll keep guard on him. 
 Oh, I will. 
 (LAUGHS THEN SPITS) 
 Don't say a word. 
 Where is she? 
 Where is Flora? Tell me where she is or I'll shoot! 
 Take him down. 
 Go on! He ain't got it in him. 
 (GUNSHOT) 
 Put your weapons down! Or I'll shoot her where she stands! 
 (WOMAN SOBS UNCONTROLLABLY) 
 Where's the girl? 
 (COUGHING) 
 Driver : Ha! 
 Has she not woke? 
 You go with her to the hospital. 
 I'll search this godforsaken place. 
 For what? 
 Alice and the other children. 
 A family of murderers that live in the brick fields. 
 Call themselves the Bishops. 
 London is full of murderers. What makes these special? 
 They killed to sell to the surgery schools, sir. 
 Their method was gas and fumes from the nearby kiln. 
 My guess is that they kept the bodies unmarked so that they could go for a higher price. 
 Have you found proof positive linking them to that thing? 
 Not yet, sir. 
 Murder, yes, but not of children. 
 The Runners are still searching the site. 
 The Bishops are in cells, awaiting questioning. 
 Along with a kidnapper, who I believe was in league with them. 
 Tried to kill my last night. 
 Then why are you here and not there? 
 I felt I should let you know immediately, sir. 
 If word gets out murder was committed on behalf of the surgery school... 
 My instruction was to find a culprit and inform me only. 
 We now have a potential scandal on our hands which will do what that monstrous object you found was designed to bring about, create outrage among the population, directed towards surgeryschools. 
 God helps us when Warburton and the newspapers get hold of this. 
 You could silence them, sir. 
 Too late. We might silence the newspapers but the bally sellers will accomplish the task for them. 
 It might yet play to our advantage, sir. 
 The existence of monsters like this makes passing the Act even more imperative. 
 Murder... sanctioned by the surgery schools! 
 Without their knowledge. 
 It matters not. 
 When word of this gets out, Mr Marlott, heads will most certainly roll. 
 Yours may very well be one of them. 
 You asked me to find people with means and motive to sabotage your act, sir. 
 That I have done. 
 Your task is not accomplished yet. 
 I suggest you find the evidence you need to make your case. 
 Yes, sir. 
 How did you know to find me at Cloth Fair last night? 
 Who told you I'd be there? Was it the Bishops? 
 It's too late for you, Billy. I know you took Alice. Flora told me. 
 It makes you the first link in the chain. 
 Was it for the Bishops or someone else? 
 Eh? What did you do with her? Did you kill her? Did they? 
 Where are her remains, Billy? 
 Where's the rest of her? 
 Where is she? 
 ♪ Oranges and lemons, say the bells of St Clement's ♪ 
♪ You owe me five farthings, say the bells of St Martin's ♪ 
♪ When will you pay me? Say the bells of Old Bailey ♪ 
♪ When I grow rich... Say the bells of Shoreditch... ♪ 
 You'll be singing differently when the noose comes down. 
 I'll be there watching. 
 You sell to the surgeons? 
 To the porters. 
 Did they know where the bodies came from? 
 They didn't ask, they didn't care, but they knew. 
 You rob graves too? 
 Sometimes we'd come across one in the fields. 
 But they sold for more than good fettle. 
 No marks. 
 Is what why the brick ovens? 
 It's how they wanted them. 
 And Billy supplied you with the children? 
 What children? 
 Who's Billy? 
 Billy Horse. 
 The childcatcher. 
 I don't know no Billy. 
 There's nothing more to be gained by lying. 
 You may as well go to your maker with a clear conscience. 
 Where are the remains? Where did you bury them? 
 I told ya. I don't know no Billy and I ain't murdered no children. 
 I birthed babes of me own. 12! 
 You killed two last night, remember? 
 But children go for more, don't they? Why would you scruple at that? 
 The strays in Smithfield talk of a monster hunting them at night. 
 That was Billy! Wasn't he? 
 I'll say this and then I'll say no more. 
 Many men have tried to make me take rule. 
 Those men are cold in their graves. 
 Our trade was killing. Don't ask me how many. I couldn't tell you. 
 Ask them as bought from me. 
 I won't deny it and I'll swing for it but I ain't ever took rule from no man and I never killed no children!

 Sir? 
 How's Flora? 
 She breathes. 
 Nothing else. 
 Hope it was worth it, sir. 
 Billy says nothing. Mrs Bishop says she knows nothing of Billy. 
 And she denies killing children. 
 She would. 
 Why? 
 She faces the gallows anyway. There's no profit in it. 
 Except the pleasure of foiling you, sir. 
 There is another way Billy could have found me at Smithfield last night. 
 Flora. 
 No. 
 No, sir. 
 She was never out of our sight. 
 And besides, she was terrified of him. 
 I think she knows something. 
 I want you there when she wakes. 
 I want you to hear it. 
 Happily. 
 If she does. 
 I'm sorry, George. 
 Excuse me, sir. Are you Herrick? 
 The gentleman inside said you might help me. 
 Boz. I write for The Chronicle. 
 What do you want? 
 Mr Marlott said that you worked on a case together. 
 We worked on many. 
 Frankenstein case? 
 What's Frankenstein? 
 Story about a madman who pieces together the bodies of the dead. 
 He said I should speak to you and you'd tell me more. 
 I've nothing to say. 
 Don't know what you're talking about. 
 I can tell you what you need to know. 
 "The finding of river corpses, or floaters as they are colloquially known, whether of natural or unnatural origin, is not an unusual phenomenon in the working life of Wapping's river police. But the discovery last week of a most singular example of that watery species has caused no little consternation. Even amongst those stalwarts of public service. For unlike its more ordinary brethren, this particular example appears to have been derived not from one but from numerous victims, stitched together in an apparent attempt at surgical reconstruction, reminiscent of those notorious, some would say blasphemous, text, Mrs Shelley's Frankenstein, or the Modern Prometheus. All of which raises the question, why on the eve of the Anatomy Act, has the disclosure of this monstrous artefact been suppressed for over a week. What public service is being served by denying Londoners the knowledge of a diabolical surgeon in their midst, acting in apparent imitation of Mary Shelley's infamous madman, Victor Frankenstein. Mr Marlott, formerly of Wapping, currently of Bow Street, may have answers to some or all of these questions. The authoress appears to have fled. Whereabouts unknown." 
 Mrs Hogg. 
 I have thought of James many times. 
 You must think very little of me, however. 
 You helped drive my son to suicide. 
 Exploited him in your fiction. 
 Now this. 
 I only meant to honour James in my book. 
 I was very young when he died. 
 We knew not what we were doing. 
 William Chester knew, though. 
 And he was no stripling. 
 Yes, indeed. 
 And I shall tell you what I told him. 
 I burned everything of James's when he died. 
 His papers and diaries. Even his clothes. 
 His very scent brought me to grief. 
 The laboratory? 
 Untouched. 
 Until yesterday. 
 Yesterday? 
 When Sir William came to call. 
 I don't wish to see inside. 
 Leave the key with the front gate when you go. 
 Of course, thank you. 
 Forget the dead. 
 The past. 
 And yet there are ghosts that may take revenge for it. 
 "We are about to take a step that will alter the course of natural philosophy for ever."
