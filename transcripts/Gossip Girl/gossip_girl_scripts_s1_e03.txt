 [INT 'KISS ON THE LIPS PARTY' - Kati is dancing] 
 Gossip Girl (Voice Over) 
 Good morning, Upper East Siders! Gossip Girl here. Your one and only source in the scandalous lives of Manhattan's elite. Top story on my homepage: Serena van der Woodsen. Everybody's favourite It-Girl has just returned from a mysterious absence and was learning the hard way that you can never go home again. 
 [INT TRAIN - Serena is looking out of the window] 
 [INT GRAND CENTRAL STATION - Serena walks in] 
 [INT WALDORF HOME - Blair is looking at a message on her cell phone from Gossip Girl saying "Serena Is Back"] 
 [INT WALDORF HOME - Chuck, Kati and Isabel are sitting on a couch, Katy and Isabel are looking at their messages on their cell phones] 
 Kati 
 You'll never believe what's on 'Gossip Girl'! 
 Isabel 
 Someone saw Serena getting off a train at Grand Central! 
 [INT BLAIR'S BEDROOM - Blair and Nate in bed, half undressed] 
 Nate 
 Serena? 
 Blair 
 Serena's at school. 
 Gossip Girl (Voice Over) 
 Why did she return? 
 [INT OSTROFF CENTRE - HALLWAY] 
 Serena 
 Let me guess, you told everyone that Erik's just visiting Grandpa in Rhode Island. 
 Lily 
 Your Aunt Carol in Miami. 
 [INT OSTROFF CENRE - Serena is looking into her brother's room] 
 Serena 
 He tries to take his own life and you're worried it's gonna cost you 'Mom of the Year'. 
 [INT OSTROFF CENTRE - ERIK'S ROOM - Erik and Serena sit on bed] 
 Erik 
 Must be a lot of rumours why you're back. 
 Serena 
 None of them mention you. 
 [INT PALACE HOTEL - LOBBY - Lily and Nate walk toward the Concierge] 
 Lily 
 Nate's gonna wait for Serena 
 Concierge 
 He can get in line behind that guy. 
 [The concierge points towards Dan who's sitting in a chair behind them] 
 [EXT PALACE HOTEL - Dan and Serena smile at each other] 
 [INT COFFEE SHOP - Lily and Rufus sit at a table] 
 Lily 
 I don't need some new boy influencing her, distracting her from her needs. 
 Rufus 
 A kid like Dan is exactly what Serena needs. 
 [INT HUMPHREY HOME - KITCHEN] 
 Rufus  
 Guess whose dad is cool! 
 Jenny 
 It's a trick question. 
 Dan 
 Yeah, 'cause it can't be ours. 
 [INT HUMPHREY HOME - Jenny and Dan are standing in front of a mirror, getting ready to go out] 
 Jenny 
 You're going out with Serena and I'm going to 'Kiss on the Lips'. Who said this family wasn't cool? 
 [INT WALDORF HOME] 
 Serena 
 I thought everything was good between us. 
 Blair 
 It was... before I found out you had s*x with my boyfriend 
 [EXT PALACE HOTEL - Lily walks up to Dan and Serena] 
 Lily 
 Great, just in time for brunch. 
 [INT THE PALACE HOTEL - BALLROOM - Dan and Serena stand at the entrance and Chuck and Blair stand together talking] 
 Blair 
 I told her to stay away 
 [INT THE PALACE HOTEL - OUTSIDE OF THE BALLROOM] 
 Serena 
 I'm not sneaking around with you 
 Nate 
 Just to talk 
 [INT THE PALACE HOTEL - CHUCK'S SUITE - Nate and Blair find Serena in the suite waiting for Nate. Blair turns to speak to Nate.] 
 Blair 
 You said you'd never speak to her again! 
 [INT THE PALACE HOTEL - BALLROOM - Serena, Dan, Chuck, Blair and Nate stand together in a circle] 
 Chuck 
 So you slept with best friend's boyfriend. I kind of admire you for it. 
 Dan 
 Is that true? 
 Blair  
 Then she ran away and lied about it. 
 Chuck 
 Poor Daniel, so little time so many sluts to defend 
 [Dan pushes Chuck who slams into a waiter causing him to fall down, all guests turn around to look at the scene] 
 [EXT THE PALACE HOTEL] 
 Serena 
 This world... it's crazy 
 Dan 
 And you're a part of it 
 [Dan turns and walks away] 
 [INT WALDORF HOME] 
 Serena 
 Blair, how can I fix this? 
 Blair 
 You don't, Serena. You just stay away. 
 [Blair turns and walks away] 
 Gossip Girl (Voice Over) 
 But now that Serena is back, will the Upper East Side ever be the same? It takes two to tangle and girls like these don't go down without a fight. 
 END OF TEASER 
 [Glamorous by Fergie is being sung by the Constance Billard Choir. We see flashes of Blair, Serena, Dan, Nate, Chuck, Kati and Isabel getting ready for school. They are all looking at themselves in their mirrors. Blair puts on her ruby ring, Serena adjusts her tie and we see flashes of them adjusting pins, brooches and watches. Serena applies her mascara, Blair puts on a white hairband, Kati and Isabel both put on chequered hairbands Nate fixes his blazer, Chuck puts on his trademark scarf and Dan is shaving himself and cutting himself frequently. They all turn and walk away from their mirrors] 
 Gossip Girl (Voice Over) 
 There's plenty of upside to being the spawn of the fabulously wealthy, but the downside, super successful parents expect nothing less from their offspring and when it comes to college that means the Ivy's. It's more than just getting into college, it's setting a course for the rest of your life and for those few who aren't legacies, the pressures are no less. When parents have sacrificed for their children's future, what kid would want to let them down? 
 [EXT CONSTANCE/ST.JUDE'S - COURTYARD - Chuck and Nate are walking together. Blair, Kati and Isabel are walking together. Dan walks past Chuck and Nate and Chuck gives him a dirty look. Blair turns around at the entrance stairs and looks at Nate. They both smile at each other.] 
 [INT CONSTANCE/ST JUDE'S - Jenny and a collection of other girls are singing in front of everyone. They finish and walk away whilst a male and female teacher walk onto the stage] 
 Female Teacher 
 Thank you ladies. 
 [We see Dan, Chuck, Nate, Blair Kati and Isabel watching this. Chuck looks bored.] 
 Female Teacher 
 Good morning students. I ask all of you to show a little sympathy for our junior class. They are almost through with Ivy Week. 
 Male Teacher 
 As is our long standing tradition, the Constance Billard girls will be in charge of Friday night's mixer and the St.Jude's boys will provide the ushers for the visiting representatives. 
 Female Teacher 
 For those of you dreaming of attending an Ivy League school this mixer is the most important event of your life. 
 Male Teacher  
 But no pressure. 
 [The male and female teacher both laugh at this and the camera zooms in on Dan] 
 [INT HUMPHREY HOME - KITCHEN - Rufus enters kitchen, Dan sits at the counter drinking orange juice and Jenny stands pouring herself a glass. Dan's face is covered with tissue from where he cut his face shaving] 
 Rufus 
 It's not that bad. 
 Dan 
 They'll think I shaved with a woodchipper. 
 Jenny 
 I was going with more of a chainsaw. 
 Dan 
 Not helping. 
 Jenny 
 Not trying to. 
 Rufus 
 Hey, look on the bright side you're not a haemophiliac, otherwise you'd be in the emergency room. 
 Jenny 
 And that's helping? 
 [Dan stands up] 
 Dan 
 Hmm... not really 
 [Jenny smiles and adjusts her tie. She then sits down] 
 Rufus 
 Dartmouth's gonna love you. 
 Dan 
 Yeah well I gotta believe that being able to shave is a prerequisite for attending. 
 Rufus 
 No one is more qualified, no one is smarter, no one is more well rounded- 
 Dan 
 Or wounded 
 [Jenny laughs] 
 Dan 
 It's not like I've got a trust fund to fall back on Dan. All I've got is up here. 
 [Dan signals to his head and then brings a finger to his lips to signal for Jenny to be quiet. Rufus starts walking towards Dan] 
 Rufus 
 Well that is the most important thing, college is about academic excellence. Besides you're going to do great in your interview, you take after your dad that way, the spotlight doesn't faze us. 
 Jenny 
 Ooh, you better hope there's not a spotlight involved. 
 [Dan and Rufus both turn to Jenny with disapproving faces. Jenny just smiles] 
 Jenny 
 I'm your sister, it's what I do. 
 Dan 
 Not when it's about Dartmouth. 
 [INT CONSTANCE/ST JUDE'S -We see Dan looking stressed. Nate and Chuck are sitting together a few rows behind Dan] 
 Chuck 
 Nathaniel, want a little wake and bake? 
 Nate 
 We've got our interviews today. 
 Chuck 
 My point exactly. 
 Chuck 
 I've got my one hitter. 
 [Chuck shifts to the end of their row and looks back at Nate. Nate doesn't join Chuck and the camera zooms in on Nate] 
 [EXT CENTRAL PARK- Nate is jogging with his father Howie. Nate overtakes his father and finishes before him, they both stop jogging] 
 Howie 
 Try not to cut me off next time; you almost knocked me over the side of the bench. 
 [Nate laughs] 
 Nate 
 I didn't cut you off. 
 [Howie gives Nate a serious look and Nate stops laughing] 
 Nate 
 I didn't mean to. 
 Howie 
 If you win fair and square, nothing would make me prouder. 
 Nate 
 Dad, we've talked about me keeping my options open, looking out West. 
 Howie 
 Yeah of course but lets get serious here. If someone with your grades wants to get into Dartmouth, you need to appear to be working for it. 
 Nate 
 Dad- 
 Howie 
 Ushering the rep is a good step. 
 Nate 
 How come everytime I bring up going to USC you act like it's a joke? 
 Howie 
 Nate there's a plan here. 
 Nate 
 Maybe I want to make my own plan. 
 Howie 
 Listen, your mother and I didn't work this hard for you to make things up as you go along. 
 Howie 
 Dartmouth, law school, Blair. Soon you're going to have everything, let's not make for work. Nail that interview today, go Green! 
 [Howie nudges Nate and then turns and starts jogging away. Nate is left standing there looking upset] 
 [INT CONSTANCE/ST JUDE'S - We see Nate sitting there with a serious look. He turns to look at Blair, who also turns to look at him. Nate then decides to shuffle to the end of the row and go outside with Chuck. Blair looks after him as he leaves.] 
 Female Teacher 
 At tomorrow night's mixer, Blair Waldorf will announce the charity her community outreach committee will honour this year. 
 [Blair looks at Isabel and smiles.] 
 Kati 
 Have you seen Serena? 
 Isabel 
 I wonder where she is. 
 Blair 
 Know what I wonder? How we're supposed to hear anything about Yale with all this talk about Serena. 
 [Kati and Isabel turn to each other with a confused look on their faces. The camera zooms in on Blair] 
 [INT WALDORF HOME -Blair is walking down the stairs talking to someone. She then sits down on a chaise lounge] 
 Blair 
 Do you remember when Dad gave me my first Yale sweatshirt? I don't think any piece of clothing has ever fit me more perfect, not to mention how adorable I found that bulldog. Remember when I asked you if I could get a bulldog? Good call by the way saying no, and now the big day is finally here. Soon Nate and I will be at college, him going down to Yale, me going up to Dartmouth. Dad flying in for the Princeton game, I hope it doesn't make you feel old watching me grow up. 
 [The camera turns and we see that she has been talking to Dorota this whole time. Dorota turns to Blair with a breakfast tray.] 
 Dorota 
 Eat up Miss Blair. Your mom would want you to have a good breakfast. 
 [Blair picks up a grape and pops it in her mouth] 
 [INT CONSTANCE/ST JUDE'S - We see Blair turn to Kati and Isabel] 
 Blair 
 So Serena's really not here? 
 Kati 
 That's what I said. 
 Isabel 
 When you weren't supposed to be talking! 
 [EXT CONSTANCE/ST JUDE'S - Serena is leaving a taxi and running up the entrance stairs] 
 [INT PALACE HOTEL - VAN DER WOODSEN SUITE - Lily is walking over to Serena who is exiting a room and eating a piece of toast] 
 Lily 
 Come on! Hurry up you're going to be late. 
 Serena 
 I am... I know 
 Lily 
 You know you shouldn't have stayed at your brother's again. Why sleep there? It's not like he can even see you, his eyes are closed. 
 [Serena is packing her schoolbag] 
 Serena 
 Do you have one maternal bone in your entire body? 
 Lily 
 Serena you need you rest, it's Ivy Week. 
 [Lily hands Serena a lip gloss and Serena applies it in front of the mirror] 
 Serena 
 I know and if I can get out of this hotel room, it's my sole ambition in life to impress the Brown rep. 
 Lily 
 I'm so thrilled to hear that that's still your plan. I know it's something we've always talked about but honestly since you've been back I've wondered if your mind was even on college. 
 Serena 
 Mom I've had my mind on a lot of things. Since recent events, going away to college sounds pretty good. 
 Lily 
 How... how did you leave things with Dan? 
 Serena 
 I don't wanna talk about it. 
 Lily 
 What's going on with you and Blair? 
 Serena 
 Mom, please! All I wanna do is just finish high school in peace and go away to a state with people who don't know who I am and just start over, okay? 
 [Serena pick up her schoolbag and walks out the door. Lily walks to the door.] 
 Lily 
 Get a cab, don't walk! 
 [INT CONSTANCE/ST.JUDE'S - Students including Dan are exiting the assembly. Serena runs up the stairs and stops at Dan] 
 Serena 
 Please don't tell me it's over. 
 Dan 
 What? You were there; I would say it's pretty over. 
 [Serena sighs] 
 Serena 
 I meant the assembly. 
 Dan 
 Alright, no, yeah, it just ended, now. 
 Serena 
 Damn it. 
 Dan 
 Alright, good luck 
 [Dan walks away past Serena] 
 Serena 
 Yeah, you too 
 [Blair approaches Serena. Kati and Isabel are approaching behind Blair] 
 Blair 
 Aww too bad you missed the assembly. Not that it matters, Brown doesn't offer degrees in slut. 
 [Serena makes a face then laughs as Blair, Kati and Isabel walk past her. Blair stops at the stairs and glares back at Serena, Serena simply smiles back.] 
 Gossip Girl (Voice Over) 
 Spotted! S not so fashionably late and dressed down by B. Game on ladies. 
 [EXT CONSTANCE BILLARD - FIELD - Serena and Blair are playing hockey with a group of other girls. Blair and Serena are both attacking for the ball] 
 Serena 
 Look I made a mistake with Nate ok, but you sabotaged me with Dan. We don't have to be friends- 
 [Blair strikes Serena down with her hockey stick. Serena stands back up again and angrily hits the air with her hockey stick. The other girls stop playing and the referee approaches them] 
 Referee 
 Waldorf? 
 Blair 
 Sorry, slipped. 
 Serena 
 I'm fine. 
 [The referee blows the whistle and they all continue playing hockey. Serena walks past Blair] 
 Serena 
 I really wanna believe that that was an accident. 
 Blair 
 Then you must be delusional. 
 [Blair runs and jabs Serena in the side. The referee blows the whistle and gives Blair a green card. Serena turns to the referee] 
 Serena 
 Thank you. 
 [The girls continue playing hockey and Blair runs at Serena with her stick and knocks her down. Serena stands back up and the referee blows his whistle and gives Blair a yellow card] 
 Referee 
 I'm running out of colours here Blair. 
 [Serena approaches and moves close to Blair] 
 Serena 
 And I'm running out of patience. Enough, okay? 
 Blair 
 It's enough when I say it's enough. 
 [Blair walks away from Serena. The girls continue playing hockey. Serena runs towards Blair and knocks her to the ground. They struggle and fight on the ground. The referee blows his whistle and the other girls run to them] 
 Referee 
 Girls break it up! 
 [Serena is on top of Blair and hitting her] 
 Blair  
 Get off of me! 
 [Serena gets off Blair and stands up. Blair then also stands up and Serena walks closer to Blair] 
 Serena 
 So we've actually come to physical blows, huh? 
 Serena 
 Truce? 
 [Blair thinks for a moment and then smiles and starts clutching her leg in agony] 
 Blair 
 My leg! 
 Referee 
 Serena, you're out of here! 
 [Serena makes a face and Kati and Isabel run to take care of Blair] 
 Serena 
 I hope it's broken. 
 [Serena then walks away and Kati and Isabel gather either side of Blair and help her to walk. Blair continues to make pained expressions and the referee examines her leg. Blair then walks off the field with the help of Kati and Isabel] 
 Gossip Girl (Voice Over) 
 Hey Upper East Siders. We hear that World War Three just broke out and it's wearing knee socks. Choose your side or run and hide. We have a feeling that this one is to the death. 
 [INT ST JUDE'S - OFFICE - A Dartmouth rep is talking to Dan] 
 Dartmouth Rep 
 Why should you be the Dartmouth Usher? 
 Dan 
 Well, I've given this a lot of thought and I think that I can answer your question in three parts and I'd like to start with the third part. If that's cool, unless that would be confusing, in which case I can start at the beginning. The Dartmouth principles of community highlight integrity, responsibility and consideration. Well, from St. Jude's I've learnt integrity, from being an older brother I've learnt responsibility and from my parents who have sacrificed everything to send me to this school I've learnt consideration. 
 Dan 
 It really comes down to one thing, Dartmouth is my dream and I've never asked Dartmouth but I think it's been dreaming of me. That was a joke or an attempted one. Next question. 
 Dartmouth Rep 
 You are the ideal Dartmouth candidate. 
 [The camera turns to reveal that the Dartmouth rep is talking to Nate] 
 Nate 
 Thank you sir and it would be an honour to attend Dartmouth; I've grown up hearing all about it from my father. I'm just not sure that it's my first choice and if there's only one usher position available, I'm sure there's someone who wants it more than me. 
 [The camera turns to show Chuck talking to a representative] 
 Chuck 
 Why should I be chosen to be an usher? 
 [He considers this for a moment and then smiles] 
 Chuck 
 I'm Chuck Bass. 
 [INT ST.JUDE'S HALLWAY - A teacher is walking past the waiting students and pins a list onto the noticeboard. The students then look at it, laugh and walk away. The teacher then walks away and Dan approaches the notice board. The list is entitled "Usher Assignments For Ivy Week". It shows that Chuck is the usher for Yale and Nate is the usher for Dartmouth. We then see that Dan is joined at the noticeboard by Nate] 
 Nate 
 Hey. 
 Dan 
 Hey. 
 Nate 
 Did you get the one you wanted? 
 Dan 
 No, no actually you did. Which makes total sense because I'm second in our class and you're somewhere, well I don't know, around last. 
 [Dan walks away from the notice board and picks up his school bag. Nate turns to him] 
 Nate 
 No hard feelings, huh? 
 Dan 
 Why should there be? I mean how many libraries has your dad had to endow to get you this spot? You've earned it. 
 Nate 
 Look man, you don't know anything about my family. 
 Dan 
 I'm sorry, you're right, you're right. I'm sure J.L Hall will be very impressed with your passion for the Dartmouth experience. 
 Nate 
 Who the hell is J.L Hall? 
 Dan 
 He's the Ivy rep! You might want to pick up his book if you want anything to talk about. 
 [Dan walks away and then turns back to Nate] 
 Dan 
 The book's called "The Petting Zoo", that's the name of his book. 
 [Dan pushes open the door and storms outside. He is walking outside angrily and is approached by Serena who is walking down the stairs] 
 Serena 
 Whoa! Angry guy, huh? 
 [Serena smiles and Dan laughs] 
 Dan 
 Short fuse, I'm trying to work on that. 
 Serena 
 Well, let me know how that goes for you. 
 [Dan stops walking and turns around to face Serena] 
 Dan 
 Yeah, I'll keep you posted. 
 Serena 
 It's a tough week. 
 Dan 
 Not for me apparently. 
 Serena 
 Oh! You got an usher position? 
 Dan 
 No I didn't and in an ironic but not unexpected twist, Nate got the one I wanted. 
 Serena 
 I'm sorry. 
 Dan 
 Well I guess that's life when you're not a legacy. 
 Serena 
 Well hey, just ‘cos you're not an usher doesn't mean you're not going to get into an Ivy League. 
 Dan 
 Yeah? Well where did your parents go to school? 
 Serena 
 Harvard and Brown. 
 Dan 
 That's all I'm saying. 
 [Dan turns to walk away and Serena makes a frustrated face] 
 [INT WALDORF HOME - Blair is lying on a chaise lounge whilst Kati and Isabel sit and press cold compresses onto her leg] 
 Kati 
 I can't believe Serena did this. 
 Isabel 
 Yeah, such a cheap shot. 
 [Blair's phone starts ringing, Blair looks at it and Kati and Isabel turn to face her. Blair answers the phone] 
 Blair 
 Finally 
 [EXT NEW YORK] 
 [INT CHUCK'S LIMO - Chuck is sitting at the back of his limo and is on the phone to Blair] 
 Chuck 
 Hello to you too, I heard about the field hockey throw down. All those mouth guards and short skirts, I hope somebody filmed it. 
 [INT WALDORF HOME - Blair is lying on the chaise lounge and has a disgusted look on her face. She scoffs at Chuck's remark] 
 Blair 
 You're heinous 
 Chuck (Voice Over) 
 That's probably why you called. 
 [Blair smiles at this] 
 Blair 
 You know me well. 
 [INT CHUCK'S LIMO - Chuck is sitting at the back of his limo and is on the phone to Blair. He is staring out the limo window.] 
 Chuck 
 Women like to pretend they're complicated, I know better. 
 [INT WALDORF HOME - Blair sets the phone on her shoulder] 
 Blair 
 My leg's numb now, how about a heating pad? 
 Isabel 
 Sure 
 Kati 
 Okay 
 [Kati and Isabel stand up and start walking away. Blair rests the phone under her chin and then presses it back onto her ear. She swings her body around and stands up away from the Chaise Lounge] 
 Blair 
 Serena came home for a reason. 
 [INT CHUCK'S LIMO - Chuck is sitting at the back of his limo and is on the phone to Blair] 
 Chuck 
 One can only guess. 
 [INT WALDORF HOME - Blair is on the phone to Chuck and is walking to the edge of the room] 
 Blair 
 Well I'm done guessing, I want answers and no one likes to be on the ground floor of a scandal like Chuck Bass. 
 [INT CHUCK'S LIMO - Chuck is sitting at the back of his limo and is on the phone to Blair] 
 Chuck 
 I am a bitch when I wanna be. 
 [INT WALDORF HOME - Blair is leaning against the wall in her room and is smiling at Chuck's comment] 
 Blair 
 Opportunity to cause some trouble, uncover a secret. 
 [INT CHUCK'S LIMO - Chuck is sitting at the back of his limo and is on the phone to Blair] 
 Chuck 
 I say yes for an answer. 
 [INT WALDORF HOME - Blair smiles and hangs up the phone] 
 [INT CHUCK'S LIMO - Chuck hangs up his phone and opens the partition between him and his driver] 
 Chuck 
 Let's turn back to school, I left something important inside. 
 [EXT NEW YORK - Chuck's limo drives down a street] 
 [INT HUMPHREY HOME - Rufus is standing and eating, Jenny is sitting at a laptop and Dan enters the house] 
 Rufus 
 Oh Danny boy, how was your day? 
 Jenny 
 He's about to hype dinner 
 Rufus 
 ‘Cos no matter how good it was, it's about to get better. 
 [Dan walks past Jenny and Rufus and enters his bedroom] 
 Rufus 
 I've outdone myself with the bolognaise. 
 [Dan slams his bedroom door behind him. Rufus and Jenny look at each other and then Rufus walks into Dan's bedroom. Rufus walks over to Dan who is lying flat down in his bed] 
 Dan 
 Sorry about the melodramatic entrance 
 Rufus 
 You didn't get it? 
 Dan 
 No I didn't get it. 
 Rufus 
 And that I do not get. 
 [Dan turns his head into his pillow and starts screaming] 
 Dan 
 They gave it to Nate Archibald! 
 Dan 
 Last year I believe he had an original thought, it died of loneliness. 
 Dan 
 I'm sorry. 
 Rufus 
 You're sorry? 
 Dan 
 Yeah I know how much you and mom have sacrificed. The whole reason you send us to a school like this is so that we can go to a college of our choice. What if it's all for nothing? 
 Rufus 
 It's not okay, it's not. So you don't get to be the usher of some whatever party- 
 Dan 
 Dad, can I just stew alone for awhile? 
 Rufus 
 Yeah. 
 [Rufus turns and exits Dan's bedroom. He closes the door behind him and walks into the other room. He has a serious look on his face and looks at Jenny] 
 Jenny 
 We're Humphrey's dad, not exactly royalty uptown. 
 Rufus 
 You're okay with that? 
 [Jenny shakes her head] 
 Jenny 
 No, but I'm used to it. 
 [EXT NEW YORK] 
 [EXT OSTROFF CENTRE - We see Serena walking down a street towards the Ostroff Centre. She is being followed by Chuck's limo. Serena walks into the Ostroff Centre, the limo stops outside it and Chuck rolls down his window] 
 Chuck 
 This is way too good. 
 [Chuck takes out his phone and starts dialling] 
 [INT WALDORF HOME - LOUNGE - Nate is lying on the sofa reading "The Petting Zoo". Blair is sitting next to him reading "In Style", her phone rings and she sets down the magazine and answers her phone] 
 Blair 
 Mom, how's Paris? 
 [EXT CHUCK'S LIMO - Chuck is looking out the window and is on the phone] 
 Chuck 
 You won't believe where I found our little princess. 
 [INT WALDORF HOME - LOUNGE - Blair sitting upright and on the phone] 
 Blair 
 Really? 
 [EXT NEW YORK] 
 [INT WALDORF HOME - BLAIR'S ROOM - We see a computer screen with pictures of Serena at the Ostroff Centre. We see that Chuck and Blair are looking at the computer screen] 
 Chuck 
 Admit it; even for me this is good. 
 Blair 
 If you weren't such a perv, I'm sure the CIA would hire you in a second. 
 Chuck 
 Defending my country, there's a future I never imagined. 
 Blair 
 With good reason, what is she doing there? 
 Chuck 
 Well what's anyone doing there? It's a facility for the disturbed and addicted. 
 [Chuck walks away from Blair and she swivels around in her chair to face him] 
 Blair 
 You must have your own wing. 
 [Chuck points at her and smiles] 
 Chuck 
 You don't get nearly enough credit for your wit. 
 [Blair smiles at him] 
 Chuck 
 So the question is what do you do now? 
 Blair 
 Oh, I was thinking total social destruction. 
 [Blair stands out of her chair and walks closer to Chuck. Chuck smiles.] 
 Chuck 
 And here I thought you were getting soft. 
 [Blair grins at Chuck. Chuck picks up part of Blair's blanket] 
 Chuck 
 So this is your bed, huh? 
 [Blair gives Chuck a dirty look and then snatches the blanket away from him] 
 Blair 
 Leaving now. 
 Chuck 
 You can repay me another time. 
 [Chuck looks at Blair and then walks out of her bedroom. Blair smiles and walks towards the computer, she sits down at the chair and stares at the screen] 
 [INT OSTROFF CENTRE - ERIK'S ROOM - Serena, Erik and Lily sit in chairs opposite Erik's councillor] 
 Serena 
 I've been in these sessions everyday for the last week but nothing is going to change unless she stops hiding him here and lets him have his life back. 
 Lily 
 This is not called hiding Serena, it's called recovery. 
 Serena 
 Telling everyone he's staying with Aunt Carol in Miami? 
 Lily 
 He's not ready. 
 Serena 
 He's not or your not? 
 Councillor 
 Okay let's take a deep breath. It's good to see honest conversation. 
 [Serena points to Lily] 
 Serena 
 What does she know about honesty? 
 Lily 
 Serena- 
 Councillor 
 But I really think a decision like this includes Erik as well. 
 Erik 
 You mean I have a say in this? Wow, thanks. 
 Lily 
 Erik, look of course we're here for you. 
 [Serena grabs Erik's arm] 
 Serena 
 Look if you're ready to leave, you tell us, okay? No matter what mom says. 
 [Erik turns to councillor] 
 Erik 
 I would really like to get out of here. 
 [Lily sighs and puts her hand in front of her face. Erik turns and looks at her] 
 Erik 
 But maybe I'm not ready yet. 
 [Lily drops her hand from her face and immediately relaxes. Serena turns to Erik and lays her hands on him.] 
 Serena 
 Hey, what about for a few hours? You can be my date for the Ivy Week party tonight. 
 Lily 
 Serena, that party is an important event for you. 
 Serena 
 Well he'll be around people he knows; it'll be fun, comfortable. 
 Erik 
 Actually that sounds great. 
 Councillor 
 Well there we go, compromise. That wasn't so hard was it? 
 [Serena and Erik both smile whilst Lily has a serious look on her face] 
 Lily 
 You know what, I have to go help them set up for tonight at the school. It's my job as both parent committee chair and responsible mother. 
 [Lily stands up and leaves the room. Serena and Erik smile at each other. 
 Serena 
 It'll be great, okay? 
 [EXT ST. JUDE'S SCHOOL FOR BOYS] 
 
 
 
 [INT ST. JUDE'S - We see people walking down a corridor carrying chairs to prepare for the Ivy mixer. Rufus walks down the corridor and looks around. He walks over to the stairs and spots a female assistant] 
 Rufus 
 Hi! How are you? 
 [Rufus runs up the stairs to meet the assistant] 
 Female Assistant 
 Good 
 Rufus 
 Rufus Humphrey 
 [Rufus meets the assistant at the stairs and they start to walk down them together] 
 Rufus 
 My kid Dan goes to St. Jude's and he really should've been selected as Dartmouth's usher, maybe there was a mix up? Some kind of a glitch in the system? I'd like to believe that because I like to believe the best in people. 
 [They both stop at the bottom of the stairs] 
 Female Assistant 
 I'm sorry Mr Humphrey but the usher positions have all been filled, there's nothing we can do. 
 [Female Assistant turns away from Rufus and starts to walk down the corridor away from him. Rufus also turns and walks along side with her. He stops walking and stands in front of her.] 
 Rufus 
 Is there anything else? Any other positions? 
 Female Assistant 
 Ahh, you'll have to discuss this with our committee chairwoman. 
 Rufus 
 Sure, perfect I'd love to, where can I find her? 
 Female Assistant 
 Not sure, she must be running late. 
 [We see that behind Rufus, Lily is approaching the doorway and is talking animatedly with someone] 
 Female Assistant 
 Oh, there she is now. 
 [Rufus turns around to look, he sees Lily and smiles. He then turns back to the assistant] 
 Rufus 
 Why am I not surprised? 
 Female Assistant 
 Lucky for you, she seems to be in a good mood. 
 Rufus 
 Until she sees me. 
 [Rufus turns away from the assistant and faces the doorway. Lily is smiling and walking through the doorway. Her smile drops when she sees Rufus] 
 Lily 
 Rufus 
 Rufus 
 Told ya. 
 Female Assistant 
 Excuse me. 
 [The assistant turns left and walks away from Lily and Rufus] 
 Rufus 
 You got a minute Lil? 
 Lily 
 Not for you 
 Lily turns away from Rufus and starts to walk up the staircase. Rufus turns to follow after her] 
 [EXT NEW YORK] 
 [INT HUMPHREY HOME -LOUNGE- Jenny and Dan are both sitting on the sofa. Dan is reading "The Petting Zoo" and Jenny is sewing a garment of clothing. The camera cuts to the door and Rufus walks through it carrying some leaflets. He smiles broadly and closes the door behind him] 
 Rufus 
 You're in. 
 [Dan turns to look at Rufus] 
 Dan 
 What? 
 [Rufus walks over to a desk in front of where Dan and Jenny are sitting. He stops and looks at the leaflets] 
 Rufus 
 The Ivy Week party tonight, your name will be on the programme and everything. 
 [Dan closes his book and Jenny looks up in shock. Dan throws his book on the table and Jenny drops the garment. They both stand up and walk towards Rufus] 
 Dan 
 You got me the Dartmouth spot! 
 Jenny 
 I knew you could do it dad. 
 Rufus 
 No you didn't and no I didn't. How do you feel about the refreshment committee? 
 Dan 
 Well there is no refreshment committee. 
 Rufus 
 Not until now. 
 Jenny 
 Oh God. 
 Rufus 
 What? Everybody gets thirsty; it's really a position of power. 
 Dan 
 How did you secure me this prominent and simultaneously embarrassing position? 
 [Rufus sits down at a chair by the desk and leaves through the leaflets] 
 Rufus 
 By offering my own services. 
 Dan 
 You're serving snacks? 
 Rufus 
 I'm the head of the entertainment committee. 
 [Dan laughs and walks back to the sofa. He picks up his book and sits down. 
 Dan 
 Another committee that didn't exist until you left the house today. 
 Jenny 
 Way to go dad! Wait so who's the entertainment? 
 Rufus 
 Since it was such short notice the only person I could get was myself. 
 Dan 
 Kind of a stayed affair for early nineties post punk mass rock, don't ya think? 
 Rufus 
 I'm bringing a couple of the guys, it'll be Rufus unplugged. 
 [We see Jenny has now joined Dan on the sofa and has the garment and sewing needle back in her hand] 
 Jenny 
 Need a roadie? 
 Rufus 
 Thanks sweetie. 
 Dan 
 Should I call mom and we could make this a fully fledged Humphrey affair? 
 [Dan smiles sarcastically and Rufus sits down opposite them] 
 Rufus 
 Look, I did the best I could. At least you get to officially be a part of this thing. You can talk to that author you love. Ask him anything you want. 
 Dan 
 Like his preference for soft drinks? 
 [EXT NEW YORK] 
 [EXT CONSTANCE BILLARD/ST. JUDE'S - We see Erik, Serena and Lily exiting a black car. A chauffeur is holding the door open for them. Lily turns to Erik] 
 Lily 
 If you get at all anxious sweetie, if you feel light headed or panicky- 
 Erik 
 I'll be fine mom. All I have to do is be normal. 
 [Lily walks ahead leaving behind Erik and Serena] 
 Erik 
 Or at least act normal. 
 Serena 
 Works for mom. 
 [They both smile and walk through the gates together] 
 [EXT CONSTANCE BILLAR/ST. JUDE'S - A party is taking place outdoors and people are mingling. We hear gentle acoustic music and we see Rufus and other band member playing various different instruments. Dan is smiling and serving a drink for someone. Blair is talking to a Yale representative whilst nearby Nate and Chuck are laughing and talking to each other. We see Serena, Lily and Erik walk into the party together. They stop and Blair and Dan both turn to look at them. Serena turns to Lily] 
 Serena 
 Do you see the Yale rep? 
 Lily 
 I thought you wanted to go to Brown and Blair wanted to go to Yale? 
 [They start walking into the party again] 
 Serena 
 Yeah, I know. 
 [We see Rufus and his band playing again and the camera turns to show Blair talking to the Yale rep] 
 Blair 
 My father would never forgive me if I didn't introduce myself. He said that you two used to be CRU together. 
 [The Yale rep starts to respond but is interrupted by Serena coming up besides them] 
 Serena 
 CRU?  
 [Serena turns to the Yale rep and extends her hand for him to shake] 
 Serena 
 Oh hi, I'm Serena Van Der Woodsen. 
 [The Yale rep shakes her hand and Serena smiles broadly. Serena turns to Blair.] 
 Serena 
 Blair, I didn't know that you are interested in joining CRU. 
 [Blair turns to Serena with an angry look on her face] 
 Blair 
 I'm not! I was just saying that there's a family connection because of my father- 
 Serena 
 -Because I didn't think you were interested in athletics at all. Well especially ones where you might get your hair wet. 
 [Serena grabs Blair and starts stroking her arm. Serena smiles towards the Yale rep] 
 Serena 
 She's really more of an indoors type of girl. 
 [Serena signals towards the Yale rep's glass] 
 Serena 
 Oh my goodness your glass is nearly empty. Let's get you a drink. 
 [Serena reaches for the Yale rep's arm and moves to lead him away from Blair. Blair moves to try and block her] 
 Blair 
 Uh, no I'll take him. 
 [Serena pats Blair's arm] 
 Serena 
 Oh, don't worry about it. 
 [Serena grabs the Yale rep's arm and leads him away] 
 Serena 
 So, tell me about Yale. 
 [The camera turns to show Blair left behind. She is visibly upset and scowls in Serena's direction. She walks over to Chuck who is gazing into the distance] 
 Blair 
 Can you please explain why Serena is commandeering the Yale rep whilst you're supposed to be his usher? 
 [Chuck turns to her and then returns his gaze to where he was previously staring] 
 Chuck 
 I switched. 
 [The camera turns to show what Chuck was staring at. We see that it's an older woman who is a representative for Princeton. She is sending flirtatious glances to Chuck] 
 Chuck 
 I'm trying to get into Princeton. 
 [Blair stares at him in an annoyed way. Chuck turns to return the stare and Blair looks away] 
 Chuck 
 Oh don't get your La Perla's into a bunch.  
 [Blair rolls her eyes at his comment and Chuck grabs her arm and steers her into a different direction] 
 Chuck 
 Look who's arrived. 
 [Chuck and Blair start walking and the camera turns to show Dr. Ostroff entering. Chuck turns to address him] 
 Chuck 
 Dr Ostroff! Blair, Doctor Donald Ostroff. 
 [Blair realises what's happening and smiles. She shakes hands with Dr. Ostroff] 
 Gossip Girl (Voice Over) 
 Interesting choice of guests B. 
 Blair 
 It's such a pleasure; I've heard such wonderful things- 
 [Blair smiles at Dr. Ostroff and grabs his arm and leads him away. The camera turns to show Chuck smiling at Blair] 
 Gossip Girl (Voice Over) 
 Coincidence? I think not. 
 [We see various shots of the party. Dan is pouring a drink for someone and we then see Nate talking to J.L Hall] 
 Nate 
 I like your book. 
 J.L Hall 
 Oh thanks, what did you think of the epilogue? 
 [Nate struggles to think of someone to say and stays silent for a moment] 
 J.L Hall 
 Some people really love it but New York Times called it a cheap cop out. Warner Brothers is making the movie; I think they're going to change the end. 
 Nate 
 I can see how the ending wouldn't seem all that... commercial. 
 [J.L Hall nods his head and doesn't know what to say to Nate's vague comment. Nate looks uncomfortable] 
 Nate 
 Umm... Would you like something to drink? 
 [We now see Lily and Erik standing together. Bart is behind Erik and is approaching them] 
 Bart 
 Lily! Hello 
 Lily 
 Oh Bart, hello how are you? 
 [Bart leans towards Lily and they both kiss each other on both cheeks. Bart then leans away and turns towards Erik] 
 Bart 
 Hey Erik! How was Miami? 
 [Erik looks uncomfortable and looks to Lily for reassurance. He turns back to Bart and smiles fakely] 
 Erik 
 It was good thanks. Y'know go Marlins! 
 [Erik raises his fist to the air] 
 [Bart and Lily both laugh politely] 
 Erik 
 Would you excuse me please? 
 [Erik walks away from them both and into the main building. As he enters it we see Kati and Isabel leaving it and talking to a male representative. They are both dressed smartly in matching outfits and they're both wearing glasses.] 
 Kati 
 So the Neurons project I'm working on involves a cellular pathway of Neural Oxide. It's initiated when- 
 [INT CONSTANCE BILLARD/ST JUDE'S - We see Erik standing alone and Jenny is walking towards him from behind. Jenny is wearing the Blue dress that Blair gave to her. Erik turns around and they both spot each other. Jenny smiles and gives him a small smile. Jenny carries on walking and Erik starts walking to meet her ] 
 Jenny 
 Hi! You're Erik, right? 
 Erik 
 You're Jenny, Dan's sister. 
 Jenny 
 Yeah! We met at- 
 Erik 
 -Bendels. Yeah I remember. 
 [They both smile at each other and don't notice Howie Archibald walking up towards Erik] 
 Jenny 
 Cool! 
 [Howie reaches them] 
 Howie 
 Erik! Good to see you. You enjoy Miami? 
 [Howie and Erik shake hands] 
 Erik 
 Ah... yeah! Save the manatees! 
 [Howie smiles and points towards Erik. He then turns and walks away, leaving Jenny and Erik alone again] 
 Jenny 
 Manatees? 
 Erik 
 It's a long story. 
 Jenny 
 I've got time. 
 Erik 
 It's a little dark. 
 Jenny 
 I can handle it. 
 [INT CONSTANCE BILLARD/ST.JUDE'S - It's a transparent glass room and Dan and Serena are standing together. Dan is at a table next to the punch bowl and Serena is opposite him] 
 Dan 
 You wanna go to Yale then? 
 Serena 
 No, Brown. It's just this thing with Blair. 
 Dan 
 I get it, since you don't actually have to worry about getting into college, why not make the entire evening about screwing over Blair. 
 [Serena looks upset by Dan's words and Nate enters the room and walks towards them. Dan offers Serena some punch] 
 Serena 
 No thanks. 
 [Nate reaches the table and picks up a cup. Serena turns towards him] 
 Serena 
 Hey. 
 [Nate avoids Serena's gaze and sighs. Serena looks hurt by Nate's reaction to her] 
 Serena 
 Wait, you're seriously not going to talk to me? Like literally not speak? 
 [Nate sighs again and then turns towards Serena] 
 Nate 
 Hey 
 [Nate then turns back towards the table. Serena is annoyed by the way that Nate is acting] 
 Serena 
 Oh! Much better. 
 [Serena looks between both Dan and Nate] 
 Serena 
 Thanks guys. 
 [Serena turns and walks away. Both Dan and Nate give Serena little reaction] 
 Dan 
 So what's he like? 
 Nate 
 Like a Dartmouth English lit professor that I have nothing in common with. 
 [Dan nods and looks upset] 
 Nate 
 I guess I could tell him how I'm an Archibald. 
 [Dan and Nate both smile at Nate's remark] 
 Dan 
 You should mention Dr. Seuss. Theo Giselle was his real name, he went to Dartmouth. Hall says he got the idea for "The Petting Zoo" from the Lorex. 
 [Nate looks really confused] 
 Nate 
 The what? 
 Dan 
 Umm... you know what never mind. Just mention how his prostyle is influenced by early Faulkner and you'll be alright. Ah, or not. 
 Nate 
 I was actually going to get some fresh air, how about you take these over to him? 
 [Nate passes two glasses over to Dan. Dan looks shocked by Nate's gesture] 
 Dan 
 Alright, yeah I guess he can read my post essay for "Petting Zoo". 
 [Dan walks away from Nate, leaving him standing by the refreshment stand. Dan nods towards Nate to thank him for the kind gesture. We see Dan leave the room and approach J.L Hall's table, Dan introduces himself and offers him the drink. J.L Hall stands and shakes hands with Dan; the camera moves to show Nate at the refreshment stand looking upset. Nate turns and walks away past his father, Howie stands and looks from Nate to Dan entertaining J.L Hall outside. Howie runs after Nate and stops him by grabbing his arm roughly. 
 Howie 
 Where do you think you're going? 
 Nate 
 Home 
 Howie 
 I don't think so, now you get back out there and finish what you started. 
 Nate 
 You mean you started. I don't want to go to Dartmouth, there I said it. Now back off! 
 [Nate turns and angrily walks away leaving Howie behind] 
 [INT CONSTANCE BILLARD/ST. JUDE'S - Erik and Jenny are sitting on the floor opposite each other in mirroring positions] 
 Erik 
 So, we moved into a hotel and it was just the two of us and I was really lonely. 
 [Erik looks upset and Jenny is looking at him sympathetically] 
 Jenny 
 So, that's when you? 
 [Erik nods to signal yes] 
 Erik 
 So I ended up at the Ostroff centre and my mom says that they're the best councillors but what they really get paid for is to keep their mouth's shut. 
 [Jenny looks really upset] 
 Jenny 
 Look, I won't say anything. I promise. 
 [Erik nods and they both smile sadly at each other] 
 Jenny 
 So... do you wanna go back in? 
 Erik 
 Yeah and answer more questions about Florida? 
 Jenny 
 I have a grandma that lives in Fort Myers. I can help think of some material. 
 [Erik smiles in thanks. Erik stands up and then offers Jenny a hand to help her get up. Jenny stands and then they both turn to exit the room] 
 [EXT CONSTANCE BILLARD/ST. JUDE'S - There is a swarm of people gathered. Blair stands up on stage] 
 Blair 
 Can I please have everyone's attention? 
 [We cut to see Kati, Isabel and Chuck standing together. They turn to look at Blair and look curious to see what she's going to say. Dan and J.L Hall stand and look at Blair. Serena stops talking and turns to pay attention to Blair with a look of disgust on her face] 
 Blair 
 Welcome again to the Constance Billard/ St. Jude's Ivy mixer. I'm Blair Waldorf, chair of the community outreach committee. 
 [We see everyone clapping including Chuck, Dan, Lily, Erik and Jenny. Serena is the only person who is refusing to clap. Blair smiles at her applause.] 
 Blair 
 Every year our schools choose to support one local institution that we feel benefits our community. This year our schools have chosen to honour the Ostroff Centre. 
 [Serena stops talking to a teenage boy and starts to pay attention to Blair's speech. She starts to realise what Blair is doing and Erik and Jenny both look upset at the mention of the Ostroff Centre. Lily looks shocked and Serena walks over to Erik and comforts him.] 
 Blair 
 This year's choice is a very personal one because the centre has helped one of our own. 
 [Erik and Serena are now next to Lily. Lily has a look of panic on her face and turns to them] 
 Lily 
 What's going on? 
 [Erik and Serena shake their heads to signal that they are unsure. They all return their attention to Blair on the stage] 
 Blair 
 It's because of their excellent programme which aids so many young addicts and alcoholics, that a student here with us today is clean and sober... at least for now. Can I please have Serena Van Der Woodsen join me on stage? 
 [Blair smiles and we see in the crowd that Dan turns to look at Serena. Serena meanwhile is in a state of shock. Everyone in the crowd is very surprised and concerned by what is going on; apart from Chuck who is extremely happy and smiling widely at Blair. Blair smiles back at Chuck and then gives a dirty look to Serena. Serena looks on the verge of tears and has to look away from Blair. Serena is standing with Lily and Erik; Lily turns to Serena] 
 Lily 
 Tell me this isn't happening. 
 [Erik looks very angry and is about to walk towards the stage in order to stop Blair] 
 Erik 
 It's not. 
 [Serena and Lily both hold back Erik and prevent him from going to the stage. Serena turns to Erik] 
 Serena 
 No, you're not going up there. You're going to stand right here, okay? 
 Lily 
 Whatever you're doing, think about who's standing in this room right now. 
 [Serena shakes her head at Lily. She then turns and walks towards the stage to meet Blair. The people in the room watch her action including Dan and Jenny. Serena stands next to Blair on stage.] 
 Blair 
 Don't try to deny it, Chuck saw you. 
 [Blair steps behind Serena so that she has the full focus of the crowd's attention. Blair leads the crowd into a round of applause for Serena. Dan watches what's happening with an upset look on his face. Serena waves to the crowd] 
 Serena 
 Hi, I'm Serena Van Der Woodsen. I just wanna thank my friend- 
 [Serena turns towards Blair who is smiling at her] 
 Serena 
 -Blair Waldorf for recognising the Ostroff Centre and all of the good things that they do. 
 [We see Chuck smirking and incredibly pleased by Serena's humiliation] 
 Serena 
 Thanks Blair. 
 [Serena turns towards Blair and starts clapping. Blair and the rest of the cloud join in with the applause. Erik looks really hurt by his sister's pain on stage] 
 Serena 
 In the Ostroff Centre, one of the main things that we learn is forgiveness- 
 [Dan looks confused and turns towards Jenny] 
 Dan 
 She's in rehab? 
 Jenny 
 No, it's her brother who's there. 
 Dan 
 What? 
 Jenny 
 You can't tell anyone, alright? 
 Dan 
 I won't but why is she doing this? 
 [Dan turns his attention back to Serena on stage] 
 Serena 
 In order to move forward for our future, we must forgive those who have wronged us in the past. 
 [Serena mildly turns her head in Blair's direction and Blair nods her head at Serena's speech] 
 Serena 
 And we ourselves must ask for forgiveness from those whom we've wronged. 
 [Serena is now very clearly looking at Blair. Blair looks uncomfortable and the crowd applaud at what Serena is saying] 
 Serena 
 Without this forgiveness, innocent people get hurt- 
 [Blair can no longer listen to the speech, so she walks over to Serena and grabs her arm to stop her talking] 
 Blair 
 Thank you Serena! Thank you! Thank you! 
 [Blair claps on stage with a large smile on her face. She moves Serena out of the way of the audience's focus] 
 Gossip Girl (Voice Over) 
 Honesty may the best policy in some zip codes but not in this one and not this week cos "I Was a Teenage Drug Addict" is not exactly a winning college essay. 
 [Many people in the crowd including Dan look at Serena with remorseful faces. Blair and Serena square off on stage and then Serena walks off the stage and exits the room. Lily follows her out. The camera returns back to Blair who still is in her spot on stage] 
 Blair 
 Can we now have Dr. Ostroff join me on stage? 
 [INT CONSTANCE BILLARD/ST.JUDE'S - Serena is standing in the room in tears. Lily is walking into the room to talk to her] 
 Lily 
 Why is Blair outing you for a drug problem that you don't have? 
 [Serena starts walking away from her and Lily follows] 
 Lily 
 You don't, do you? 
 [Serena stops walking and turns around to face Lily] 
 Serena 
 Mom! 
 Lily 
 Well, it's not like we have some free open relationship- 
 [Serena is now enraged] 
 Serena 
 -and that's my fault! 
 Lily 
 Look, what's happened to Erik has put a huge strain on our family but we are still a family. 
 Serena 
 Why do you think I did what I just did? 
 [Lily nods sadly at Serena] 
 Serena 
 Will you excuse me? I'm gonna go end this with Blair... now. 
 [Serena turns and walks out of the room away from Lily. We see that Lily is very upset and annoyed by what's happened] 
 [EXT CONSTANCE BILLARD/ST.JUDE'S - We see Serena stepping out of the room and outside where the party is occurring. Serena approaches Blair who is standing and talking with the Yale representative] 
 Serena 
 Blair, what the hell was that? 
 [Blair turns to the Yale Representative] 
 Blair 
 Will you excuse us please? 
 Yale Rep 
 Sure 
 [Blair walks away and is followed by Serena. The Yale Rep looks at them and is clearly confused by what's going on. Blair stops walking and turns to face Serena] 
 Serena 
 So we good now? We square? 
 Blair 
 No! Because nothing I do can ever be as bad as what you did to me. 
 [Serena looks on the verge of tears] 
 Serena 
 Look, I'm asking you please, I'll stop if you will. 
 Blair 
 You're just saying that because you lost and you're gonna keep losing. Now if you'll excuse me, unlike you I have a future to get back to. 
 [Blair walks away, leaving behind a distraught Serena. Serena composes herself and then also walks away in the same direction that Blair did. Dan watches her walk away and chooses to follow her] 
 [EXT CONSTANCE BILLARD/ST.JUDE'S - COURTYARD - Serena is marching out of the school grounds and is being followed by Dan] 
 Dan 
 Serena! 
 [Serena carries on walking and ignores his call] 
 Dan 
 Serena! 
 [Serena angrily turns around to face him] 
 Serena 
 What? What do you want to congratulate me on destroying my future? 
 Dan 
 No. I just wanted to ask if you are okay, cos what you did in there for your brother. It was really cool. 
 Serena 
 Wait, how did you know that it was my brother? 
 Dan 
 It's okay; really no one will ever hear it from me. 
 [Dan puts his hand on his heart] 
 Dan 
 But if you ever need somebody to talk to or not talk to. I'd be happy to go out with you. 
 Serena 
 I'll keep that in mind. 
 Dan 
 And I know I said some things about you and your world and I'm sorry. Obviously I don't know anything about your life. 
 [Serena smiles at Dan] 
 Serena 
 Thank you but I really need to get out of here. 
 Dan 
 Yeah. Sure. Sure. 
 Serena 
 But maybe I can take you up on that getting together and not talking thing sometime. 
 Serena 
 Will you call me? 
 [Dan smiles and nods] 
 Dan 
 Yeah 
 [Serena smiles at him and then mouths bye to Dan. She turns and walks away, leaving Dan smiling at her with a large smile] 
 [INT CONSTANCE BILLARD/ST.JUDE'S - Erik is standing in the transparent glass room. Lily walks up and approaches him] 
 Lily 
 Okay let's go, let's get out of here. 
 [Lily gently puts her hand on Erik's arm] 
 Erik 
 No, there's someone I need to talk to first. 
 Erik 
 Please mom, I can do this. 
 Lily 
 Okay 
 [Erik walks away from Lily and approaches Blair.] 
 Erik 
 Blair, can I talk to you? It will just take a minute. 
 Blair 
 Sure! 
 [Blair smiles and walks away with Erik. She leaves behind Kati and Isabel whom she had previously been speaking with. Lily turns and watches them leave the room] 
 [INT CONSTANCE BILLARD/ST.JUDE'S - Blair and Erik have now entered a different room. Erik is leading the way and Blair is following behind him. Erik stops walking and turns around to face Blair] 
 Erik 
 Serena's not a patient at the Ostroff Centre- 
 Blair 
 -Erik, you've always been a sweet kid and I understand you trying to protect your sister. 
 Erik 
 I am. 
 [Blair smiles at this announcement] 
 Blair 
 I've never even seen you take a drink. 
 Erik 
 I'm not an alcoholic. I did this! 
 [Erik pulls up his sleeve to show Blair a large scar on his wrist. Blair's face falls as she looks at the scar and realises what she's done] 
 Erik 
 And today Serena protected me. 
 [Blair can't look Erik in the eye and seems to be lost for words] 
 Blair 
 Erik...I...I didn't- 
 Erik 
 -See that coming. Well that must be a shock for someone who thinks she knows everything. 
 [Blair looks on the verge of tears and Erik walks past Blair and out of the room. As he exits the room, Chuck enters it and starts to walk up to Blair from behind] 
 Chuck 
 What was that all about? 
 Gossip Girl (Voice Over) 
 Another bomb lands in Blair's lap. Will she use it as ammunition or will she finally surrender and put down her arms? 
 [Blair is nearly in tears and is trying to compose herself. Chuck is looking at her with a mixture of both curiosity and concern. Blair swallows a lump in her throat] 
 Blair 
 Nothing. 
 [EXT NEW YORK] 
 [INT HUMPHREY HOME - KITCHEN - We see a close up of Dan's copy of "The Petting Zoo". On the opening page we see a written message from J.L Hall saying "To Dan. Hope to see you in two years". The camera zooms out to show that Rufus is the one reading the message in the book whilst Dan sits at the counter drinking some coffee and reading a magazine] 
 Rufus 
 So you really impressed the guy, huh? 
 [Rufus walks past Dan and around to the other side of the counter. He is now directly facing Dan and he sets the copy of "The Petting Zoo" down.] 
 Rufus 
 Must be the way you poured those sodas. 
 [Rufus turns around and pours himself a cup of coffee] 
 Dan 
 Yeah about that, uh, I know I may have been a little light with the gratitude. 
 Rufus 
 Yeah, a touch. 
 [Rufus turns around with his cup of coffee and looks at Dan] 
 Dan 
 But I appreciate it, all of it. Even if I sometimes don't show it. 
 Rufus 
 We're real men son; we don't like to share our feelings. 
 [Dan smiles at this remark and picks up his cup of coffee.] 
 Rufus 
 But I know what you're capable of and nothing; my last name, my bank account, is going to stop you from getting what you deserve. Not if I can help it. 
 [Dan looks at his father and appreciates what he's saying to him] 
 Rufus 
 And I see that Dartmouth has an electro acoustic music programme, what do you think of me applying? 
 [Dan leans and reads what Rufus is talking about in one of his magazines] 
 Dan 
 What? 
 Rufus 
 And Jenny's smart; we can get her early admission and maybe we'll all go. 
 Dan 
 So not remotely funny. 
 [Dan and Rufus both smile at each other] 
 [INT PALACE HOTEL - CHUCK'S SUITE - We see that Nate's phone is ringing on a table. There is a trail of clothes spread over the floor and Chuck is lying sleeping in bed. The ringing of the phone awakens Chuck and he throws a pillow at Nate so that he will answer it. We see that Nate is asleep on Chuck's sofa and is half dressed. The pillow hits the ground near Nate and he wakes up. Nate looks at the phone and picks it up. He reads the Caller ID and sighs, he then answers it] 
 Nate 
 Hello? 
 [Nate sits upright with his eyes closed and listens to the caller] 
 Nate 
 Oh yeah, I'll be right there. 
 [Nate ends the call and then returns the phone to the table that it was previously sitting on. The camera moves to show Chuck now awake in bed] 
 Chuck 
 Where the hell could you possibly have to be right now? 
 Nate 
 I'm late for a run with my dad. 
 [Nate reaches for a napkin that is sitting on the table in front of him. He reads what is on it and then turns to Chuck] 
 Nate 
 Who's Jessica? 
 [Chuck is now smiling smugly at the mention of the name] 
 Chuck 
 Jersey girls. 
 [Nate stands up and pulls his vest on] 
 Chuck 
 Let's just say they're the Princeton tigers for a reason. 
 [Nate laughs at Chuck's remark. He then picks up his phone from the table] 
 Nate 
 Alright, I'll see ya. 
 [Nate walks out of the room and Chuck gives him a small wave from his bed] 
 [EXT CENTRAL PARK - Nate is walking up some stairs and is met up the top by Howie and J.L Hall] 
 Howie 
 Hey, good to see ya son! 
 [Howie signals towards J.L Hall] 
 Howie 
 Turns out Jeff's a runner too. 
 J.L Hall 
 I would never have mentioned it if I knew he'd have me out here this early. 
 [J.L Hall leans forward and shakes hands with Nate] 
 J.L Hall 
 I'm glad to see you're feeling better. 
 Howie 
 Nate, I was just telling Jeff about your little bout of food poisoning last night. 
 [Nate looks at his father with a confused expression on his face] 
 Howie 
 What do you say kiddo? Wanna show him how it's done? 
 Nate 
 Let's go. 
 [Howie turns to J.L Hall] 
 Howie 
 Nate is the captain of his Lacrosse team as well as being an All Star Cross Country runner. 
 [Howie nudges J.L Hall on the arm and they begin to run out of shot together. Nate is left standing, confused by his father's actions. Nate then walks after them] 
 [INT OSTROFF CENTRE - ERIK'S ROOM - Erik is sitting on the floor playing solitaire on his laptop. His door is left open and we see Jenny walk up to it. Jenny knocks on the door and Erik sees her and smiles. He closes the lid on his laptop and stands up and walks over to Jenny] 
 Jenny 
 Hey! 
 Erik 
 Hey! 
 Jenny 
 Is it okay that I'm here? 
 Erik 
 Yeah! Hi! 
 Jenny 
 Ah, will your mom be mad? 
 Erik 
 That you're here? Well that would require her stopping by. 
 [Jenny looks confused by this] 
 Erik 
 Saturday morning's are spent at Bliss. After last night I think that she could do with some extra time on the massage table. 
 [Jenny nods in understanding] 
 Jenny 
 Well... here 
 [Jenny hands a gift over to Erik. She turns right and sees a large bouquet of flowers] 
 Jenny 
 Somebody has an admirer. 
 Erik 
 They're for my sister. 
 [Jenny looks confused] 
 Erik 
 From the Brown rep; apparently his cousin did some time here in his youth. 
 Jenny 
 Well that's good! At least her whole future isn't totally blown. 
 Erik 
 I don't think that's making her feel a whole lot better right now. 
 [Jenny nods in understanding] 
 [EXT NEW YORK] 
 [EXT CENTRAL PARK - It's raining and Serena is sheltered in a secluded spot. She is alone and lying on a bench reading a book. Blair walks up to her and Serena looks up] 
 Blair 
 Whenever something's bothering you, I can always find you here. 
 [Serena sets her book down. She then stands upright and faces Blair] 
 Serena 
 You here for another catfight? 
 [Blair opens her clutch and removes an envelope from it. She closes her clutch and Serena stares at the envelope] 
 Serena 
 What's that? 
 Blair 
 A letter; I wrote it to you when you were away at boarding school. 
 [Serena gives Blair a fed up look] 
 Blair 
 I never sent it. 
 [Blair looks down at the letter and starts reading from it] 
 Blair 
 Dear Serena, my world is falling apart and you're the only one who would understand. My father left my mother for a 31 year old model; a male model. I feel like screaming because I don't have anyone to talk to. 
 [Serena looks at Blair sympathetically] 
 Blair 
 You're gone. My dad's gone. Nate's acting weird. Where are you? Why don't you call? Why did you leave without saying goodbye? 
 [Blair and Serena are now both at the verge of tears] 
 Blair 
 You're supposed to be my best friend. I miss you so much. Love Blair. 
 [Blair now stops reading from the letter and puts it back inside the envelope. She looks up at Serena] 
 Serena 
 Why didn't you send it? I could've- 
 Blair 
 -You could've what! 
 [Blair is now choked up with tears and her voice is breaking] 
 Blair 
 You knew Serena and you didn't even call. 
 Serena 
 I didn't know what to say to you. I didn't know how to be your friend after what I did. I'm so sorry. 
 Blair 
 Erik told me what happened; I guess your family's been going through a hard time too. 
 Gossip Girl (Voice Over) 
 Spotted in Central Park: Two white flags waving. Could an Upper East Side peace accord be far off? 
 [Blair and Serena both smile at each other] 
 Gossip Girl (Voice Over) 
 So what will it be? Truce or consequences? We all know one nation can't have two queens. What happens next? Only time will tell. XOXO Gossip Girl. 
 [The camera zooms out to show both Blair and Serena staring at each other]
