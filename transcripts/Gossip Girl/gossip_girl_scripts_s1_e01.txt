 [INT GRAND CENTRAL STATION, Serena walks in, a girl watches her and takes a photo with her cell phone]  
 Gossip Girl (Voice Over) 
 Hey Upper East Siders, Gossip Girl here... and I have the biggest news ever. One of my many sources, Melanie91, sends us this: Spotted at Grand Central, bags in hand: Serena van der Woodsen. Was it only a year ago our It-Girl mysteriously disappeared for quote 'boarding school'? And just as suddenly she's back. Don't believe me? See for yourselves: Lucky for us, Melanie91 sent proof. Thanks for the photo, Mel!  
 [Rufus takes a look around the station and finds his son and daughter, he walks up and hugs them]  
 Rufus 
 Dan, Jenny! Over here!  
 Jenny 
 Hey, dad!  
 Rufus 
 Hey, hey! You made it. Welcome back! How was your weekend? How was your mom?  
 Dan 
 She's fine.  
 Jenny 
 Good... fine, I guess.  
 Dan 
 She's good and fine.  
 Rufus 
 Like 'Maybe I should never have left Manhatten' fine or 'Taking a time-out from my marriage was the best idea I've ever had' fine?  
 Dan 
 Dad, you know... I'm starving.  
 Rufus 
 Let's go home. I'm cooking. Caprese salad with a little mozzarella di Bufala... yeah, I'm gonna make you guys...  
 [Rufus puts an arms around Jenny and they walk off, Dan turns around and notices Serena]  
 Gossip Girl (Voice Over) 
 Spotted: Lonely Boy... can't believe the love of his life has returned. If only she knew who he was. But everyone knows Serena. And everyone is talking.  
 [EXT NEW YORK - Several people are standing in the streets, looking at the newest 'Gossip Girl' entry on their cell phones]  
 Gossip Girl 
 Wonder what Blair Waldorf thinks. Sure, they're BFFs but we always thought Blair's boyfriend Nate had a thing for Serena.  
 [INT HOME OF THE WALDORFS - BATHROOM - Blair takes a look at a new text message: 'Serena is Back!', she leaves the bathroom and rejoins a party, her mother, Eleanor, is talking to a friend]  
 Eleanor 
 ...I have to design a dress for this woman.  
 [Eleanor turns to Blair]  
 Eleanor 
 Blair, if you're gonna to wear one of my designs tell me about it so we can at least get it properly fitted.  
 Blair 
 Thanks, mom. Keep that in mind. Great party.  
 [Eleanor turns back to her friend]  
 Eleanor 
 She is my best advertisement.  
 [Nate, his father, Howie, and another guest are standing together]  
 Party Guest 
 So, Nate, started thinking about college?  
 Howie 
 Well, actually I'm a Dartmouth man.  
 Nate 
 Yes, dad's always spoken very highly of Dartmouth. But I would like to check out west. You know, maybe USC, UCLA?  
 Howie 
 His mother wouldn't hear of it. Dartmouth is far enough away for her.  
 Nate 
 Yes, well... Dartmouth is my first choice.  
 [Blair walks up to her boyfriend, Nate, and his father, also called 'The Captain']  
 Blair 
 Excuse me, captain. Nate, can I borrow you?  
 Nate 
 Eh, sure. Excuse me for a second.  
 [Chuck, a friend of Nate's is sitting on the couch with Isabel and Katy]  
 Chuck 
 Nathaniel, any interest in some fresh air?  
 [Chuck signals Nate that he wants to smoke a joint with him]  
 Nate 
 When I get back?  
 Blair 
 If he gets back!  
 [Blair leads Nate into her bedroom and pushes him onto the bed]  
 Nate 
 What's going on?  
 Blair 
 I wanna do this... It... Now.  
 Nate 
 Now now? You wanted to wait...  
 Blair 
 Not anymore.  
 Gossip Girl (Voice Over) 
 Better lock it down with Nate, B. Clock's ticking.  
 [Chuck plays with his drink, looking bored, Isabel and Katy are reading their text mesages]  
 Katy 
 My god, you'll never believe what's on 'Gossip Girl'.  
 Isabel 
 Someone saw Serena get off a train at Grand Central.  
 Chuck 
 Good, things were getting a little... dull around here.  
 [EXT HOME OF THE WALDORFS - The doorman opens the door of a town car, Serena gets out]  
 Serena 
 Thank you.  
 [INT BLAIR'S BEDROOM - Blair and Nate are kissing on the bed, undressed]  
 Blair 
 I love you. Nate Archiblaid. Always have, always will.  
 Nate 
 I love you too.  
 [INT HOME OF THE WALDORFS - Serena walks in and gets noticed by Eleanor]  
 Eleanor 
 Serena van der Woodsen? Is that you?  
 [Eleanor knocks on the door]  
 Eleanor 
 Blair, it's Serena!  
 Nate 
 Serena?  
 Blair 
 Serena is at school. Kiss me.  
 Nate 
 No, I think I heard your mom say she's here. Don't you wanna go say hey?  
 [Nate gets of the bed and starts getting dressed]  
 Blair 
 Yeah... totally.  
 [INT HOME OF THE WALDORFS - Serena is walking through the party guest who start talking behind her back]  
 Party Guests 
 ...I heard she is pregnant... rehab... she looks good...  
 [Serena walks up to her mother, Lily, who is talking to a friend]  
 Lily 
 So I told him: Forget it, I don't care if it's mahogany. It clashes with my sofa.  
 Serena 
 Mom... mom! Hey.  
 Lily 
 Oh, Serena, darling.  
 [They hug each other]  
 Serena 
 So, were is he? What, they haven't let him out yet?  
 Lily 
 Let's not discuss this right now, ok? I thought you might want to see some of your friends.  
 Serena 
 Thanks.  
 [Serena notices Nate on the other side of the room, Blair opens her bedroom door and walks into the room, blocking Nate from Serena's view, Serena and Blair hug]  
 Blair 
 Hi, Serena, so good to see you.  
 Serena 
 Good to see you.  
 Blair 
 Come, we're about to have dinner.  
 Eleanor 
 I'll set a place for you at the table next to Blair.  
 Serena 
 Yeah, actually... there's somewhere I have to go.  
 Blair 
 You're leaving?  
 Serena 
 Yeah, I just... I don't feel well. I just wanted to come by and say hi. I'll see you at school tomorrow.  
 [Serena leaves the party]  
 Blair 
 School... so I guess she's back for good.  
 Katy 
 Didn't you know she was coming?  
 Blair 
 Course I did. I just... wanted it to be a surprise.  
 Gossip Girl (Voice Over) 
 Word is that S bailed on B's party in under 90 seconds and didn't even have one lemon shot. Has our bad girl really gone good? Or is it all just part of the act?  
 [INT OSTROFF CENTER - Serena walks in, passes the nurse's station and looks into a patient's room]  
 Nurse 
 Young lady, you can't be here. Visting hours are over.  
 Serena 
 I'm family. He's my brother.  
 [INT HOME OF THE HUMPREYS - DAN'S BEDROOM - Dan is looking at the blog of 'Gossip Girl']  
 Gossip Girl (Voice Over) 
 Why'd she leave? Why'd she return? Send me all the deepth. And who am I? That's one secret I'll never tell. The only one. XOXO Gossip Girl.  
 END OF TEASER  
 [INT OSTROFF CENTER - ERIK'S ROOM - Serena's brother, Erik, finds Serena sleeping on a chair next to his bed and wakes her up]  
 Erik 
 Serena... Serena, hey.  
 Serena 
 Hey, how are you?  
 Erik 
 You know, I've been better.  
 Serena 
 Erik, I know I've been a terrible sister. I'm so happy to see you.  
 Erik 
 Must be a lot of rumour why you're back.  
 Serena 
 Yeah, but none of them mentioned you.  
 Erik 
 Just like mom wants, hm?  
 [Lily enters]  
 Lily 
 What do I want, baby? For Serena sleeping in her own bed, possibly wearing pyjamas.  
 Serena 
 Morning, mom. Hey, I was just about to ask the doctor if I could take Erik to breakfast. Wanna come?  
 Lily 
 Ehm, I think what I'll do is to get him a croissant down the street.  
 [Lily leaves the room, Serena storms after her]  
 Erik 
 Serena, don't!  
 Serena 
 Let me guess: You told everyone Erik is just visiting grandpa in Rhode Island.  
 Lily 
 Your aunt Carol in Miami.  
 Serena 
 So, you're actually hiding him. He tries to take his own life and you're worried it will cost you 'Mom Of The Year'?  
 Lily 
 Serena, you've been gone. Doing who knows what with god knows who...  
 Serena 
 I told you, boarding school was not like that.  
 Lily 
 As happy as I am to have you home, you have no idea what it's been like.  
 [INT HOME OF THE HUMPHREYS - KITCHEN - Jenny organizes handwritten invitations, Rufus is making breakfast, Dan walks in]  
 Rufus 
 Guess who's dad is cool!  
 Jenny 
 It's a trick question.  
 Dan 
 Yeah, 'cause it can't be ours.  
 Rufus 
 Look at this!  
 [Rufus hands Dan an issue of 'Rolling Stone', Dan reads the front page]  
 Dan 
 'Top 10 Forgotten Bands Of The '90s'.  
 Rufus 
 Yeah, check out who's number nine.  
 Jenny 
 He is very proud.  
 Dan 
 Hey, hey way to be forgotten!  
 Rufus 
 But that's how you get remembered.  
 Jenny 
 Maybe you'd care if dad's band was on 'Gossip Girl'.  
 Dan 
 What? I don't read 'Gossip Girl'. That's... that's for chicks.  
 Jenny 
 So that wasn't your laptop you've been to last night to read all about Serena van der Woodsen.  
 [Dan takes the magazine from Rufus]  
 Dan 
 Holy stone, wow! Let me take a look at this again, dad. Very cool, looking hot, number nine!  
 Rufus 
 Hey, what are you working on?  
 Jenny 
 It's called the 'Kiss On The Lips' party. Everyone's going.  
 Dan 
 You're invited to that?  
 [Jenny stares at Dan]  
 Dan 
 Well, no offense if I sound surprised... since I've never been invited.  
 Jenny 
 One of the girls in my art class saw my calligraphy and she said that if I addressed all the invitations that I got one.  
 Rufus 
 Sounds very fair. Sweatshops could learn a thing or two.  
 Jenny 
 Dad, this is not a platform for me to end capitalization. That's why you make us go to private schools.  
 Rufus 
 That's for your education.  
 Jenny 
 So we should be anonymous losers who eat lunch alone and never get invited to parties?  
 Dan 
 Works for me.  
 Jenny 
 Mom thinks it's a good idea.  
 Rufus 
 And her judgment is always sound, right? Jenny, if you wanna go to that party you should go. You kids could use some fun.  
 [EXT THE PALACE HOTEL - Serena walks up to the front entrance, Nate is already waiting for her]  
 Serena 
 Nate?  
 Nate 
 Oh, hey! Uhm, your mom told me you guys are staying here at The Palace.  
 Serena 
 Yeah, we're renovating... again. You know my mom: If it's not broke, break it. So what are you doing here?  
 Nate 
 Oh, I just wanted to see how you were. You seemed kind of upset last night.  
 Serena 
 I got to get going and change for school. I'm gonna be late.  
 Nate 
 Serena...  
 Serena 
 No, no.  
 Nate 
 But you're back now.  
 Serena 
 I didn't come back for you. Look, Blair's my best friend and you're her boyfriend and she loves you. That's the way things are supposed to be.  
 [EXT NEW YORK CITY - Dan runs across the street to catch his bus to school]  
 Taxi Driver 
 Hey, watch were you're going!  
 [INT BUS - Chuck and Nate are sitting next to each other, Dan is standing in the alley]  
 Chuck 
 Serena looked effing hot last night. There's something wrong with that level of perfection... it needs to be violated.  
 Nate 
 You are deeply disturbed.  
 Chuck 
 And yet you know I'm right. You're telling me if you had the chance...  
 Nate 
 I have a girlfriend.  
 Chuck 
 You guys have been dating since kindergarden and you haven't sealed the deal.  
 Nate 
 Who says 'seal the seal'?  
 [Chuck signals Nate that they have arrived at school]  
 Chuck 
 Come on.  
 [They get up, Dan is standing behind them, Chuck turns to Dan]  
 Chuck 
 You following us or something?  
 Dan 
 No, I... I go to your school. Identical uniforms, that's kind of a tip-off?  
 Nate 
 That's funny.  
 [Chuck and Nate leave the bus, Dan talks to himself]  
 Dan 
 So you guys wanna sit together at lunch?  
 [EXT MET - Blair, Isabel and Katy are sitting on the steps looking at the invitations, Jenny is standing next to them]  
 Isabel 
 So cute! They should be framed or something.  
 Blair 
 Not bad work. And here is yours... as promised.  
 [Blair hands Jenny one of the invitations]  
 Jenny 
 Thanks.  
 [Serena walks up to them, eating a yoghurt]  
 Serena 
 Hey, here you guys are. I looked all over the dining hall for you.  
 [Serena notices Jenny and shakes her hand]  
 Serena 
 Oh, hi, I'm Serena.  
 Jenny 
 I know, uhm, I mean, hi, I'm Jenny.  
 [Serena picks up one of the invitations]  
 Serena 
 So, when's the party?  
 Blair 
 Saturday. And you're kinda not invited. Since until 12 hours ago everyone thought you were at boarding school. And Jenny used up all the invites.  
 Jenny 
 Uhm, actually...  
 Blair 
 You can go now.  
 [Jenny leaves]  
 Blair 
 Sorry.  
 Serena 
 No, it's ok. I've got a lot of stuff to do anyway.  
 [Serena throws the invitation onto the steps]  
 Blair 
 Well, we should get going then. Unless you want us to wait for you. Looks like you got a lot of yoghurt left.  
 Serena 
 No, go ahead.  
 [Blair, Isabel and Katy walk away, Serena turns around]  
 Serena 
 Blair, think we can meet tonight?  
 Blair 
 I'd love to but I'm doing something with Nate tonight.  
 Serena 
 The Palace, 8 o'clock. Nate will wait.  
 Gossip Girl (Voice Over) 
 Spotted: At the steps of the Met, an S and B power struggle.  
 Blair 
 I can probably do a half hour.  
 Gossip Girl (Voice Over) 
 Did S think she could waltz home and things would be just like they were?  
 Serena 
 Thanks for making the time.  
 Blair 
 Your my best friend.  
 Gossip Girl (Voice Over) 
 Did B think S would go down without a fight? Or can these two hotties work it out? There's nothing 'Gossip Girl' likes more than a good catfight. And this could be a classic.  
 [EXT NEW YORK CITY - Rufus is putting up flyers for a concert of his band 'Lincon Hawk', Dan is with him]  
 Dan 
 Uh, you know... you know, dad, there's this thing called 'myspace' where you post all this information online. Save some trees, have a blog.  
 Rufus 
 Maybe if musicians would get off their blogs and picked up their guitars then music business would be in better shape.  
 Dan 
 Ok, like a true relic.  
 Rufus 
 Thanks, son.  
 [Dan's cell phone rings, he takes a look at the new text message: Jenny (Mobile), Sep 24, 2007, 3:15:23 PM, HELP: EMERGENCY. 712 5TH AVE.]  
 Dan 
 Hey dad, listen, uhm, I got to run. You'll be ok?  
 Rufus 
 Yeah. You'll mom will be back. She's always been a free spirit. That's one of the reasons I fell for her in the first place.  
 Dan 
 I meant with the flyers.  
 Rufus 
 Luckily, staple guns are old-school. Go, I'm gonna be fine.  
 [INT OSTROFF CENTER - ERIK'S ROOM - Serena walks in]  
 Serena 
 I talked to the nurse and I'm kidnapping you.  
 Erik 
 We're going shopping, aren't we.  
 Serena 
 We're going to Wendells... just for an hour though, I swear. I had a really bad day.  
 Erik 
 Really? 'Cause I had a great day: A couple of pills, bunch of Rorschach tests... they had this green jelly for lunch.  
 Serena 
 Mmh, yummy! Why didn't you save me any? Come on, we need to get you out of here before mom shows up.  
 [INT WENDELLS - DEPARTMENT STORE - Dan walks up to Jenny who's trying on a red dress]  
 Dan 
 Jenny, what is it? What is wrong?  
 Jenny 
 Do you like this on me?  
 Dan 
 Wait... wait a second, is that why you needed me? I thought this was an emergency.  
 Jenny 
 A fashion emergency. I mean, come on, I've never been to a big dance before.  
 Dan 
 Neither have I.  
 Jenny 
 Yeah, but mom's gone and dad's allergic to department stores.  
 Dan 
 Well, you look good, Jen. You do, really.  
 Jenny 
 Thanks. I'm mean, too bad it's more than our rent but I think I can sew something like it.  
 [Jenny notices Serena and Erik walking towards them]  
 Jenny 
 Oh my gosh, it's Serena. Hi, Serena!  
 [Jenny takes an invitation adressed to 'Serena van der Woodsen' out of her bag, Dan panics and vanishes]  
 Serena 
 Hey. Hey, Jenny, right?  
 Jenny 
 Yeah.  
 Serena 
 This is my...  
 Erik 
 Stylist and personal shopper. Erik, hi.  
 Jenny 
 Hi, uhm, this is my brother... or...  
 [Jenny gestures behind her, notices Dan is gone, Dan is hiding behind a rack of dresses, watching Serena]  
 Serena 
 So is this your dress for the 'Kiss On The Lips' party?  
 Jenny 
 Sort of. Speaking of that.  
 [Jenny gives Serena the invitation]  
 Jenny 
 Here, I made you one during free period but anyone asks where you got it, I know nothing.  
 Serena 
 Thanks.  
 [Serena and Erik walk away]  
 Jenny 
 Dan, Dan?  
 [Serena turns around]  
 Serena 
 Jenny, that dress would look even better in black.  
 Jenny 
 Black. Cool. Thanks.  
 [EXT NEW YORK - PARK - Chuck and Nate are taking a walk, smoking a Joint]  
 Chuck 
 This is some good stuff.  
 Nate 
 Yeah, I'm gonna need it. Blair's mom's at the country house.  
 Chuck 
 Yeah? Then maybe I should swipe some of my dad's viagra? Or my mom's paxils? Nathaniel, you're finally about to have s*x with your girlfiend. It's like you're heading to your execution.  
 Nate 
 No, man. I'm good.  
 Chuck 
 Talk to Chuck, buddy. You and Blair have been dating forever, all of a sudden there is a problem?  
 Nate 
 There is no problem. It's just... do you ever feel like our whole lives have been planned out for us? That we're just gonna... end up like our parents?  
 Chuck 
 Man, that's a dark thought.  
 Nate 
 You know, aren't we entitled to choose... just to be happy?  
 Chuck 
 Look, easy, Sokrates. What we're entitled to is a trust fund... maybe a house in the Hamptons, a prescription drug problem. Happiness does not seem to be on the menue. So smoke up and seal the deal with Blair... 'cause you're also entitled to tab that ass.  
 [INT THE PALACE HOTEL - BAR - Serena and Blair are sitting at the bar, Blair is drinking a Martini]  
 Serena 
 So, how's your mom doing... with the divorce and everything?  
 Blair 
 Great. So my dad left her for another man. She's lost 15 pounds, got an eye-lift. It's been good for her.  
 Serena 
 I'm really sorry.  
 Blair 
 Yeah, I could tell since you didn't call or write the entire time it was happening.  
 Serena 
 No, I know... I was just... boarding school... it's like...  
 Blair 
 I don't even know why you went to boarding school to begin with. Do you know how it felt, calling your house when you didn't show up at school and having your mom say: Serena didn't tell you that she moved to Connetticut?  
 Serena 
 I just... I had to go. I needed to get away from everything. Please just trust me.  
 Blair 
 How can I trust you when I feel like I don't even know you.  
 Serena 
 Let's fix that. I saw you at school with Katy and Is and I get it. I don't want to take any of that away from you. I just...  
 Blair 
 Because it's just yours to take if you want it?  
 Serena 
 No, that's not what I mean. I... I miss you. I just want things to go back to the way they used to be. You know, walking to school togheter, dancing on tables at Bungalow, the nights when we were at your mom's country house. You were like my sister... and with our families... we need each other.  
 Blair 
 Well, you missed some classic Eleanor Waldorf melt-downs. If it wasn't such a tragedy it would have been funny. Actually kinda was.  
 Serena 
 Well, I wish I could have been there.  
 Blair 
 You are now. I have to meet Nate. I kind of have something special and...  
 Serena 
 Well, I don't want to keep you but...  
 [Serena hugs Blair]  
 Serena 
 I love you, B.  
 Blair 
 I love you too, S.  
 [Blair leaves]  
 Gossip Girl (Voice Over) 
 Spotted: At The Palace Hotel, S and B having a heart to heart.  
 [Serena takes Blair's left over Martini and emptys it in one gulp]  
 Gossip Girl (Voice Over) 
 Hmm, why so thirsty, S? You may have won over B for now but we still think you're hiding something.  
 [INT HOME OF THE HUMPHREYS - JENNY'S ROOM - Jenny is sitting at the sewing machine, Dan enters]  
 Dan 
 Hey!  
 Jenny 
 Ah, the invisible man returns. You know, I really had no idea you could move that fast.  
 Dan 
 Yeah, well, your fashion emergency was solved, so... I figured my work was done.  
 Jenny 
 Come on, Dan. Serena said hi to you at her 9th grade birthday party and you've never forgotten it.  
 Dan 
 How could I? She was the only person who spoke to me. And I'm pretty sure she thought I was someone else.  
 Jenny 
 Well, you know, she is actually nice. And if she did know you I think she would really like you.  
 Dan 
 I don't know, I think she would be a tad overwhelmed by the glitz and the glamour of the Humphrey lifestyle.  
 Jenny 
 Well, I heard she's living at The Palace Hotel.  
 Dan 
 Well, my point exactly.  
 Jenny 
 Probably sitting at the bar by herself, sipping Martinis... all alone. You know, it's actually kinda sad. Oh, and dad's at the gallery working late. He left money for dinner, so I was thinking Indian.  
 Dan 
 You know... you know what, I think I'm... I'm gonna go out.  
 [Dan leaves]  
 Jenny 
 Ok... good, 'cause I already ordered and only got enough for one.  
 [INT THE PALACE HOTEL - BAR - Chuck enters, shoves some women aside]  
 Chuck 
 Hello, please.  
 [Chuck walks over to Serena who is having another Martini]  
 Chuck 
 I love this town. I'm going to have to tell my parents the hotel they just bought is serving minors.  
 Serena 
 And if you get a drink they are also serving pigs.  
 Chuck 
 I love it when you talk dirty.  
 Serena 
 You just love when a girl talks to you.  
 Chuck 
 Actually, I prefer them when they're not talking.  
 Serena 
 Oh, I've missed your witty banter.  
 Chuck 
 Let's catch up. Take our clothes off, stare at each other.  
 Serena 
 What about I just get a bit to eat. I've been drinking on an empty stomach.  
 Chuck 
 I heard you didn't do that anymore.  
 Serena 
 Special occasion.  
 Chuck 
 Well, what about a grilled cheese with truffel oil? You do love truffels?  
 Serena 
 Enough to know it's not on the menue.  
 Chuck 
 But then I'm connected.  
 Serena 
 Only because I'm hungry.  
 
 
 
 [INT HOME OF THE WALDORFS - BLAIR'S BEDROOM - The room is lit by candles, Nate enters, Blair is waiting for him in lingerie]  
 Nate 
 Wow.  
 Blair 
 Hi.  
 Nate 
 Hi.  
 Blair 
 Is it too much? I wanted it to be special.  
 [Blair kisses Nate but he pulls away]  
 Blair 
 What's wrong?  
 Nate 
 Look, I don't know how to say this... or if it's even the right thing to do but ehm... there's something I need to tell you.  
 [INT THE PALACE HOTEL - KITCHEN - Chuck puts a bundle of Dollar bills into the jacket of the chef, Alfonso and his staff leave]  
 Chuck 
 Alfonso, you're stud. Now have good night, we're closing the kitchen early.  
 Serena 
 Oh my god, this is so good.  
 Chuck 
 Well, if you're looking for a way to thank me I've got a couple ideas.  
 Serena 
 It's a sandwich, Chuck.  
 [Chuck touches Serena's thigh and leans in on her]  
 Serena 
 This is... this is not happening right now.  
 Chuck 
 You're worried Nate will find out?  
 Serena 
 What?  
 Chuck 
 Last year... the Sheperd wedding... think I don't know why you left town?  
 [FLASHBACK - ONE YEAR AGO - INT BAR - Serena is dancing on the bar, holding a bottle of champagne, Nate tries to stop her]  
 Nate 
 Serena, you are not supposed to be here.  
 Serena 
 Oh well, if the happy couple didn't want to put up a catch for the bar they should let me be where I want to be. Move!  
 Nate 
 Let me see it!  
 Serena 
 No, make me!  
 Nate 
 I can do it, I can open it. Let me show you... here, come here. Let me see...  
 Serena 
 No!  
 Nate 
 Let me... stop?  
 [They both pull on the bottle until it opens with a loud bang]  
 Serena 
 Nate!  
 Nate 
 That never happens to me.  
 Serena 
 It's ok. You're stronger than me, alright.  
 Nate 
 Come here.  
 Serena 
 Look at you, you're a mess.  
 Nate 
 So are you.  
 [Serena and Nate are about to kiss]  
 [INT BLAIR'S BEDROOM - Nate turns his face away from Blair]  
 Blair 
 But... that was it... you guys kissed.  
 [Nate shakes his head]  
 [FLASHBACK - ONE YEAR AGO - INT BAR - Serena and Nate make out heavily, undressing each other, Chuck watches from the balcony]  
 [INT THE PALACE HOTEL - KITCHEN]  
 Chuck 
 Best friend and the boyfriend. That's pretty classy, S. I think you're more like me than you admit.  
 Serena 
 No, no, that... that was then. I'm trying to change.  
 Chuck 
 I liked you better before.  
 [Chuck tries to kiss Serena, she pushes him away]  
 Serena 
 Stop it. Stop! No! Stop it!  
 [FLASHBACK - ONE YEAR AGO - INT BAR - Serena and Nate are having s*x, Serena is gasping loudly]  
 [INT BLAIR'S BEDROOM - Blair pushes Nate away]

 [EXT - NEW YORK - PARK - Nate and his father are having a race, Howie wins]  
 Howie 
 Nice try, son.  
 Nate 
 Maybe next time.  
 Howie 
 You seem upbeat this morning. Did you have fun with Blair last night?  
 Nate 
 Actually, we got into a pretty big fight.  
 Howie 
 You want my advice? Apologise. Even if it was her fault. Flowers, maybe some jewellery if she's really upset. Always works for your mother.  
 Nate 
 I don't know. I think it may be for the best.  
 Howie 
 Wait a minute, you guys broke up?  
 Nate 
 Yeah, I guess we did.  
 Howie 
 Blair is a great girl.  
 Nate 
 I know. But I'm just not sure if she's the girl for me.

 Howie 
 I will get it... if you just help me out a little bit.  
 [Nate looks at his father in disbelief]

 How did you know it was Miss van der Woodsen if you didn't read it and if you are not a guest at the hotel what were you doing there?

 Dan 
 No, no, no, no...

 She doesn't know me. Nobody knows me. It's cool, it's fine.

 Uhm, from last night, right? I'm sorry about that.  
 Dan 
 You remember me?

 [Dan starts walking off]

 Nate 
 Thanks for meeting me. Look, Blair, I really hurt you and I know that and I want to fix it.

 Really? And how are you gonna do that?  
 Nate 
 I'm gonna put everything in the past. I'm not gonna see Serena again or even talk to her. It'll be like she doesn't exist.  
 Blair 
 I think that's a good idea. Let's not mention it again. You gonna eat that?  
 [Blair picks up a piece of sushi from Nate's plate]  
 Nate 
 That's it? 'Cause you were pretty upset last night... I mean, should we talk about this?  
 Blair 
 There is nothing to talk about. I overreacted... you say it's in the past, it's in the past. I'm sure you have no feelings for her anymore. I just feel bad for Serena... she'll really miss you. What time does the limo come?

 Eight.

 Like you said: Small island.  
 Rufus 
 Oh, I get it: You hear about Alison, use your daughter as an excuse to start something.  
 Lily 
 Yeah, in your dream!  
 Rufus 
 Well, you are in my dreams, Lily... and one of them particular occurs finding you in the back of a Nine Inch Nails bus with your shoes in your earrings and Trent Reznor... oh, that happened!  
 Lily 
 No need to rehash details of decades pass. So I moved on.  
 Rufus 
 Yeah, from Chanterlane to Paris until you switched up rock stars for billionaires.  
 Lily 
 You think you're so cute. Washed up band, crappy so-called 'art gallery'.

 Eleanor 
 This one is not as elegant a choice as that one.  
 Blair 
 Why do you care so much?  
 Eleanor 
 Because I love you. Blair, you will never be more beautiful or thin or happy than you are right now. I just want you to make the most of it.
