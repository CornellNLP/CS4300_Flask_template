 Oh. What? 
 Um, he told me to ask you. 
 Sorry, what-what is that? 
 Is he asking for money? 
 You really shouldn't be driving in this weather. 
 We could get trapped in a mudslide. 
 Mom, I don't think you should send him any money anymore.

 Okay, well, what do you think? 
 I want to give him money?

 It'll shock you and call the hospital. Mom! 
 It even has a GPS in case she gets lost. 
 You're not allowed in the car anymore. 
 Goodbye now. 
 If you can't behave, you can't stay.

 There's all kinds of things that... 
 ... people can participate in during the day, even if they have jobs at night, and they-they wake up, and they go out, let the sun hit their skin. 
 You know, even if they work in restaurants. 
 And there's all kinds of things they can participate in. 
 You know, work at night and actually see the light of day, maybe. 
 I don't know. It's a crazy thought. 
 Mom? 
 Mom! Mom. 
 Hmm. Chef?

 That was intunse. 
 I know what I want. 
 I want a quinceañera. 
 You want a quinceañera? 
 You can't. 
 We can't do that. 
 We're too white for that. We're not allowed. 
 It's against the law. 
 It's not cultural appropriation, Mom. 
 It's-it's appreciation. 
 I mean, I-I want to honor the roots of the land that I literally live on, which was, for all intents and purposes... 
 
 
 
 Let's face it... Mexican land. 
 I mean, c-come on. Uh, Los Feliz, uh, Sepulveda, Pico, Santa Monica. 
 Are you kidding me? I-I want to acknowledge that California is a Latinx commonwealth of people who have been marginalized. 
 You're so culturally... whatever. 
 No, I'm not. 
 Well, geez, you never even had a Bat Mitzvah. 
 I know. That's the point, and now I'm too old for one. 
 And you're too Jewish for a quinceañera. 
 And you're not too old for a Bat Mitzvah. 
 You can get Bat Mitzvahed at any age. 
 Remember, we went to Auntie Pascal's Bat Mitzvah. 
 Yeah, but Mom, I-I want to be the age of the thing that we're supposed to be celebrating traditionally at the time. 
 Huh. 
 Well... 
 And I want my dad to come. 
 I mean... you to invite him. 
 I want... whether he shows up or not, I-I don't care. 
 I just, I want... you to invite him. 
 Okay. Okay. Okay. 
 Okay. Okay, okay. 
 Listen, I-I-I-I am happy to have a party for you. That would be my pleasure to do that for you. You have to... invite my dad, Mom. 
 Oh. 
 You have to. It's part of it. 
 Oh. 
 "Oh, my God, shoes." 
 Sorry, not sorry. 
 Will you? 
 Mm-hmm. Yes. 
 Uh-huh. Yup. 
 Yes, I am. I will do that.

 That's what young people do, they move on. 
 You need some more brown? 
 Uh, I don't think I should. 
 I don't think I should. 
 I think the brown is getting me more down. 
 I knew I was in for pain. 
 Yeah. 
 Well, at least he had the balls to be honest with you. 
 Finally, I had to say the words. 
 "You seem different. What's going on?" 
 And when he said... 
 "I feel like I'm not as into it as you are," 
 I argued with him. 
 I tried to talk him into... loving me. 
 I tried to talk him into it. 
 Tried to talk him into loving me the way I love him, and... 
 It's insane. 
 Stupid. 
 But I didn't care. 
 Super attractive. 
 Yeah, really cute. 
 Cute-cute, right? 
 It's like a pheromone. 
 Desperacy. 
 Such a good look on me. 
 Oh. Shh. 
 Hi. 
 Sorry. No, no. 
 You okay, Guncle Rico? 
 This is... this is so embarrassing. 
 I'm a mess. 
 Come here. 
 Thank you. 
 Do you know, you're gonna get through this. 
 Time is your friend. 
 And we're all here for you. 
 And you'll find love again. 
 And if you put the work in now, you'll be better in the long run. 
 And, later, when you meet someone, they'll be better for you. 
 Because you'll be better then, too. 
 Okay. 
 Good night, sleep tight, don't let the bedbugs bite. 
 See you in the morning light. 
 Not if I see you first. 
 I love you both. 
 Uh... 
 I can't believe she even exists. 
 Same. 
 That killed me. Yeah. 
 Why don't you put the Housewives on? 
 Yes. Yeah. 
 - Housewives. Yeah. 
 Good? 
 Yes. 
 Hon. 
 Hey, hey, hey, baby! 
 Oh, my God! It's so good to see you! 
 I love you so much. 
 I love you more. 
 Well, I hope you're ready, 'cause... tonight's the night I'm finally gonna stick it in. 
 f*ck yeah. 
 My evil plan worked. 
 You turned me. 
 I turned you. Yes. 
 Oh, this is a good one. 
 You've seen this? Mm-hmm. 
 Duker! 
 Get chocolate! Oh, that's... 
 From the secret drawer! 
 Oh, that's a great idea. 
 Mm. Oh.
