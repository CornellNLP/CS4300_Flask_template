 [Betty Everett's "you're no good" playing] 
 Hey, Rusty, what do you say? 
 Hey, Jeff. 
 Hey, boys, how are we? 
 Hey, mister. Got any money? 
 Any money? Who am I, Mickey Mantle? 
 One for you. One for you. 
 Shouldn't you hooligans be home with your mothers? 
 I don't got no mother. 
 ♪ learned my lesson, it left a scar ♪ 
 Get a haircut. 
 ♪ And now I see how you really are ♪ 
 How you guys doing? 
 ♪ You're no good, you're no good ♪ 
♪ you're no good ♪ 
 ♪ baby, you're no good ♪ 
 Wow, look at you. 
 The old man gives you Mr. O's Pool Hall, Smitty gets the book. 
 Me? I get a one-way ticket to Palookaville. 
 This sh1t is nothing, Rusty. 
 You know, if you're smart, you play your cards right, you're gonna end up with the whole goddamn thing. 
 Yeah? When? 
 You know the old man's not gonna give me sh1t. 
 If I'm ever gonna be boss, I got to take it myself. 
 You gonna take it from your father? 
 How the hell you gonna do that, Rusty? 
 He made my life a living hell. 
 Maybe I'll do the same for him... force him to finally pay me a little respect. [Opens lighter] 
 Well, before you get too far ahead of yourself... [lighter flicks] 
 We might have another little problem. 
 You know that douchebag Richie Kane? 
 Yeah, I met him a few times. Kid's a punk. 
 Got a big mouth. Thinks he's slick. 
 He does have a big mouth. 
 He's talking sh1t all up and down the Avenue about how he's gonna take care of whoever killed Mr. O Oh, is that a fact? 
 I wish him the best of luck on that. 
 I'm being serious here, Rusty. 
 We got to keep an eye on this kid. 
 You know, he was Mr. O's enforcer, along with that Skeev Hopkins. 
 These young kids, they're crazy. 
 The word is, he was going after the big guy. 
 He wanted to take over the whole West Side. 
 He's got dreams, and that's not a good thing. 
 We can't take him lightly, Rusty. 
 Kid's got dreams? 
 Now he's got a nightmare. 
 [Car horns honking, indistinct conversations] 
 But I didn't know you made the move to the 'burbs. When'd you do that? 
 About three months ago. We did it for the kids. 
 Well, I got Christine busting my hump about doing the same thing, but I just keep trying to avoid the conversation, you know? 
 Typical Irish illusion. 
 Better not to talk about it, sweep it under the rug, then let it fester and have it kill you. 
 Exactly. [Laughs] 
 So, what's going on here? What's the favor you need? 
 It's nothing too major, but I got this bookmaker coming in, hustling my bar and restaurant crowd the last few weeks. 
 Now, I tried to let it slide, but it's getting out of hand. 
 You got a name on him? 
 He calls himself Steady Freddy. 
 Oh, yeah, I know Freddy. 
 He's a Hell's Kitchen guy, but he's harmless. 
 What time does he usually show up? 
 Right in the middle of the lunch crowd around 1:30. 
 All right, I'll stop by tomorrow, I'll have a talk with him, and we'll get rid of this pest, no problem. 
 You take care of this, I'll take care of you. 
 I like the sound of that. 
 Why didn't you tell me this earlier? 
 Because she was scared, and she made me swear not to tell anybody. 
 Yeah, for good reason. 
 She wanted to stay here. 
 If I would have let her, Rusty would have never found her. 
 We don't know that Rusty did it. 
 Who else could have done it? [Huffs] 
 Tell me exactly what she told you. 
 All right. She said she was in Mr. O's car waiting for him with some other girl. 
 And when he came out, she saw Rusty shoot him, and that Rogers and O'Reilly threw him in a cab, and then took off. 
 This is bad, T. 
 I think we should just get our sh1t and get out of here because once I tell the guys, they're gonna want revenge. 
 And go where? 
 I don't know. I got a friend down in Miami. 
 Maybe we can go there till all this blows over. 
 Hey, no, no. You cannot do that, Bobby. 
 Huh? 
 Hey, you're a part of their crew. 
 If they're gonna do something, they're gonna need you to stick around and fight with them. 
 If you leave, they're gonna kill you themselves. 
 I'm not supposed to get involved in this kind of sh1t, T. 
 My cousin said I'm just supposed to do harmless bullshit, that's it. 
 Okay? I didn't sign up for this. 
 It's a little too late for that, Bobby. 
 You're already involved. 
 Now you're gonna call Smitty, and you're gonna tell him now. 
 [Indistinct conversations] 
 What's up, J.J.? Everything good? 
 All good, Freddy. 
 [Phone rings] 
 [Elevator door dings] 
 Steady Freddy, there's the man I was looking for. 
 Hey, sh1t! Muldoon. 
 What the hell are you doing here? 
 You know, I heard a rumor you got lost. 
 This joint isn't on your regular route, is it? 
 Oh, no. Well, you know, I'm not actually working. 
 I'm just stopping in for a beer is all. 
 Yeah, yeah, sure, you are. 
 What do you say we sit down, have a little chat? - All right. 
 Can I talk to you? 
 Yeah. 
 Now? 
 Is this what I think it is? 
 Yeah, I told you he's a cop. Remember? 
 And he thinks it's safe to just leave it out here in the open? 
 I wasn't tempted to touch it, but clearly you are. 
 And what, so he's just gonna sleep here all day? 
 Well, he worked all night, and then he had to wait for the courts to open. 
 So, by the time he got here, it was morning. 
 Is that normal? 
 Yeah. 
 If he's working an overnight tour and he makes an arrest, yeah, that's normal. 
 Is this really what you want, to date a cop? 
 We're not dating. 
 We're just having fun. 
 But isn't he just like the kind of guys from your neighborhood you told me you couldn't wait to get away from? 
 Babs, we're just hanging out, all right? 
 Come on, you know me. 
 We are not getting married any time soon. 
 Steady Freddy : Let me just explain. 
 No, you do not get to explain sh1t, all right? 
 You get to listen. 
 Okay, you know me. I'm a great listener. 
 Then listen good. You no longer work this hotel. 
 That is done. I find out that you come back here even for a beer, I'm gonna collar your ass. 
 We clear? 
 We're clear, you know. 
 Come on, man, it's me, Steady Freddy, baby. 
 I don't make no fuss. I don't cause no trouble. 
 Good, good. Then let's make sure we keep it that way. 
 All right? This is a big city. 
 There's plenty of opportunities to make money elsewhere, right? 
 Speaking of, you want I should make a little donation to the cause of your choosing? 
 No, no, no, no, no. Keep your money. 
 I'm gonna let you slide today, Freddy, because I like you. 
 But this is still gonna cost you. 
 I need some information. 
 What are you hearing on the street about my Uncle's murder? 
 I haven't heard a thing, but I do have a personal theory, if you're interested. 
 I don't have to let you slide. 
 I can grab you right now, I'll take you down to the precinct. 
 Okay, okay,  okay,  man. Listen, look. 
 Who had the most to gain from Mr. O going bye bye? 
 Smitty. 
 Are you trying to jerk me around here? 
 Smitty's not a murderer, you know that, and he was John's best friend. 
 I didn't say he pulled the trigger. 
 Just hear me out. What if he tipped somebody off, right? 
 Patton's number one bookmaker is a very lucrative position. 
 That doesn't help me, all right? I need more than theories. 
 So here's what you're gonna do. 
 You're gonna find out some real information for me. 
 See if the Pattons were involved in this at all. 
 You do that, and maybe I'll see about opening up some more business for you. 
 And maybe we'll work out a deal to get you back in the hotel. 
 Okay. 
 I'm gonna get some sh1t for you. 
 Good. I'll be in touch. 
 [Car horns honking] 
 I'm, uh, here to see Smitty. 
 Hey. 
 Man : Yeah, yeah. 
 Thanks. 
 Hey, Sol. 
 Specs, what's up? 
 Not too much. 
 Smitty. 
 Hi, Bobby. 
 How can I help you? 
 I think I got something you're gonna want to hear. 
 Have a seat. 
 I think I know who killed Mr. O How'd you come to that? 
 'Cause my girl knew that whore who got killed the other night. 
 And she said the whore and her friend were with Mr. O at Arthur's the night it happened. 
 What did she say  exactly? 
 She said that Rusty Patton had some words with Mr. O earlier in the night. 
 They were talking sh1t back and forth. 
 And Mr. O pulled a gun on Rusty. 
 That sounds like Mr. O, all right. 
 Uh, then what happened? 
 Then Rusty took off. 
 About an hour later, Mr. O Stumbles out of the bar, and the hooker is already waiting in his car. 
 So that's when she saw Rusty approach Mr. O and shoot him. 
 Then a cab pulled up. 
 They threw him in, and they took off. 
 You're saying this is the same whore who got killed the other night? 
 Yeah. 
 What about the other hooker? 
 She seems to be gone, too. My girl doesn't know where. 
 Listen to me carefully, all right? 
 Keep this sh1t to yourself. 
 Tell your girlfriend to do the same. 
 Just tell no one, especially not your cousin Richie. 
 All right, you can go now. 
 [Mutters] 
 [Sighs] 
 [Exhales] Jeez. 
 It's a freakin' disaster. 
 ♪♪ 
 [Pinball machine dinging] 
 Rosie. 
 Warm me up? 
 [Dinging continues] 
 Vince, what do you say? 
 Hey... 
 Hey. 
 [Sighs] 
 How'd it go? 
 Those kids on the Upper East Side must have some serious cash, because they were playing for big money. 
 What about the moose? Was he there? 
 I'm surprised you haven't heard. 
 We grabbed his kid, Sergio. 
 Let me ask you something. 
 How well do you know that little greaseball? 
 Well, I was at his christening, but he's a punk. 
 Always has been. 
 The problem is, the moose has some grand plans for him. 
 That's why he sent him to Yale, thinks he's gonna be some kind of criminal mastermind or something. 
 Yeah, well, he did not look so smart with Bullman's foot up his ass. [Laughs] 
 Now, listen to me, Tucch, you should know. 
 Johanson does not trust Tedesco and he said he's got some concerns about your relationship with him. 
 Oh, concerned about what? 
 I know this guy since the first grade. 
 We went to St. Anthony's together. 
 We had first holy communion together. 
 Our mothers were best friends growing up, for Christ sakes. 
 Well, look. What the hell is he concerned about? 
 I'm just telling you what he told me, take it or leave it. 
 But you should know, if you want to stay in clothes, you're gonna have to get tougher with that big wop. 
 Wait a minute. Aren't you the guy that told me it's not smart to have an adversarial relationship with these guys, that it's bad for business? 
 It is bad for business, all right, but the moose is a shitty business partner. 
 Now I know he's your paisan, all right, but he has been cheating us, and we've been letting it slide for too long. 
 No, that's not true, Terry. 
 There's only so much muscle I can use with this guy. 
 Yeah? And why is that? Because you're such good old friends? Or maybe it has something to do with that cute little niece of his. 
 Oh, you heard about that? 
 Yeah, I heard about that. 
 It's my job to know what goes on inside this division. 
 No, Terry, this one is special. She is one in a million. 
 But I wouldn't worry yourself about it. 
 I haven't touched her... Yet. 
 [Both laugh] 
 Well, look. It is not me I'm worried about. 
 What's that supposed to mean? 
 It means you should not be putting us into this kind of situation, all right? 
 The rules are the rules, and they are not yours to bend. 
 All right, all right. 
 And I am not just talking about the girl. 
 Smitty told you not to tell us? 
 Yeah, but I figured you'd want to know. 
 Goddamn right I'd want to know. 
 But let me ask you. 
 Why'd you go to Smitty first? 
 I-I don't know. 
 He's the boss, right? 
 Oh, so you work for him now? 
 Because I thought I brought you in. 
 You're my freakin' cousin. 
 You get news like this, you don't come to me first? 
 Right, yeah, yeah, okay, I get it. I'm sorry. 
 Okay. 
 Here's what we're gonna do. 
 We're gonna go to Patton's right now, the three of us, and we're gonna take Rusty out. 
 Whoa, Richie. You sure about that? 
 I mean, it's the middle of the day. 
 Who gives a sh1t what time it is? 
 You ain't never been over there. They got 10, 12 guys in there. 
 We'd never get near him. 
 Then we'll wait for him outside. 
 Richie, I-I don't know that this is a job for me. 
 [Laughs] Don't worry, Specs. 
 Me and Hopkins will take care of you. 
 All you got to do is drive. 
 I can drive. 
 If you want. That way, Bobby can help if you need. 
 Will you shut the hell up? I... 
 I don't want to get involved in killing anybody. 
 Hey... [Crashing] 
 What the hell is the drama? 
 I thought you wanted to be a part of this crew. 
 But if you don't, get your ass out of here! 
 [Grunting] 
 [Gasps, panting] 
 [Lid clatters] 
 Get your ass out of here. Get up. 
 [Clattering] 
 [Sighs, sniffs] 
 [Bus passing] 
 Come on, Teresa, let's go. 
 Kane : Bobby, you leave now, and I'm done with you. 
 T, I'm outta here. 
 Jesus. Bobby, hold up. 
 Look, Richie, if you really want to go after Rusty, we need more guys. 
 He's got an army. 
 Maybe we should go to Smitty first, make peace with him. 
 If we're gonna do this sh1t, it'd be good to have his help. 
 Make peace with him? 
 I ain't making piece with that prick. 
 That piece of sh1t is probably behind all this. 
 Why else wouldn't he want us to know? 
 I don't know. 
 We're gonna go to Smitty right now and have it out with him. 
 You know, my brother still blames you for all his problems. 
 Me? What the hell did I do? 
 When you went to Boston, that's when Patrick started to get into trouble. 
 He was getting into plenty of trouble before that. 
 We both were. [Spits] 
 Which is why my mother sent me away in the first place. 
 The only difference is while your brother continued down his wayward path, I was getting my ass kicked into shape by the jesuits. 
 You guys were in the ninth grade when you left. 
 How bad could you have been? 
 Oh, I've been sworn to secrecy, darling. 
 And now you're a cop. 
 Yeah, one of New York's finest. 
 [Laughs] How the hell did that happen? 
 Well, when I failed out of Boston college, I had to get a job. 
 But why a cop? 
 Why not? 
 Well, for starters, I hear the pay is terrible. 
 [Laughs] I do all right. 
 So that's it? No higher calling? 
 Like what? 
 You don't think that your becoming a cop has anything to do with the fact that your father was a gangster? 
 No. 
 No, it's got nothing to do with him. 
 [Indistinct conversation] 
 [Car door shuts] 
 Yeah, come on in, boys. [Sighs] 
 We figured you'd show up here. 
 Is it true you don't think anything needs to be done about this? 
 [Shotgun cocks] 
 That's right. 
 What the hell are you afraid of? 
 You know it was Rusty, and you want to do nothing? 
 I don't care who did it. 
 There's nothing to be gained by doing anything. 
 It ain't a matter of what's to be gained. 
 It's a matter of respect. 
 You want to go after Rusty and his crew, that's your plan? 
 Yeah, and then after that, Patton's left with nothing but the old men. 
 And then we go after them. 
 And then what? 
 You're gonna take over the West Side? 
 Yeah, that's the plan. That's the idea, the same one that me and Mr. O talked about. 
 It was a dumb idea then, it's a dumb idea now. 
 You know, I don't get you, Smitty. 
 You should want to do something about this because John was your friend. 
 Sometimes you got to get new friends. 
 Now get the hell out of here before we blow your ass through the door. 
 Come on. 
 You were in on it, weren't you, Smitty? 
 Just keep walking, Richie. 
 Okay. 
 But I'll be back with Rusty's head. 
 And then I'm coming for yours. 
 I'll see you soon. 
 [Door closes] 
 *** is gonna cost me, you should take me out to dinner. 
 I mean, it's the least you could do. 
 All right, you hump. 
 You pick the spot, and it will be my treat, how about that? 
 All right, good, let's go to that new Italian joint in the theater district. 
 They got a broad working the coat check there that is a knockout. 
 I am not taking you out so I can watch  you  chase some broad. 
 All right, fair enough. 
 So, what, you want to take out the wives? 
 We haven't done that in a long time. 
 Wait, wait, wait. 
 So now I'm taking out the two of you? 
 Oh, come on, it'd mean a lot to Celeste. 
 She actually likes you and Christine, which is saying something, and it might keep her off my back for a couple days. 
 Yeah, well, you know what? 
 If you stopped chasing every skirt in the city, maybe she wouldn't be on your ass all the time. 
 Can I help it if the ladies find me irresistible? 
 So what, you want to take out the wives, or no? 
 All right. 
 But we got to do it tonight. 
 Let me set it up. I got something in mind. 
 I'll call Celeste. She'll be very excited. 
 [Patsy Cline's "walkin' after midnight" playing] 
 I could get used to this. 
 What's that? 
 Watching you in the kitchen. 
 Heh. Well, you got the wrong girl for that. 
 What's that supposed to mean? 
 It means I got bigger dreams than cooking and cleaning. 
 [Clears throat] Like what? 
 What kind of big dreams they fill your head with up at Sarah Lawrence? 
 I told you, I'm gonna be a journalist. 
 Oh, yeah, right, like that broad in "His Girl Friday." 
 Yeah, something like that. 
 So you gonna work for the "News" or the "Post"? 
 Hopefully the "Times." 
 The "Times"? 
 Whoa. You gonna beat up on the cops like the rest of 'em? 
 Only when they deserve it. 
 You think you're a real tough chick, don't you? 
 Who, me? I'm just a product of my environment.

 [Car horn honks] 
 You better get a grip, O'Reilly. 
 You're talking crazy sh1t. I'm sorry. 
 I just can't get it out of my head. 
 Every time I pick up a fare, I see Mr. O in my backseat covered in blood and laughing at me. 
 I don't know what to tell you. 
 Nobody forced you to come work for us. 
 I know. 
 I know, but not like this. 
 I didn't think you'd ask me to kill somebody. 
 You didn't kill anybody, you stupid sh1t. 
 Well, I was there. 
 Maybe I got to turn myself in. 
 You're not gonna do anything like that. 
 Listen, if anybody's gonna take the all for this, it's gonna be Rusty. 
 Absolutely not, Terry. 
 Ah, come on, Chris. She's not that bad. 
 She's not that bad? She's horrible. 
 Please don't make me. 
 Look, I already gave Vince my word, and they're expecting us tonight. 
 But you never actually have to talk to her. 
 You and Vince get into some side conversation about work, and then she's bending my ear about what a dog he is. 
 Mom, that's funny. How is daddy's friend a dog? 
 It means he chases women. 
 No, it does not. 
 What it means is that sometimes daddy's friend stays out a little too late after work, that's all. 
 Yeah, because he's chasing women. [Laughs] 
 Do you have to chase women at work, too, Dad? 
 No, I do not. 
 Only the prostitutes, right, Dad? 
 What the hell do you know about the prostitutes, young man? 
 We see 'em all the time walking home from the movies. 
 Oh, do you? - There's this one girl, Dad, you wouldn't believe it. 
 She was so big, she looked like a guy. 
 She looked like a guy? You know why? 
 She probably was a guy. 
 She was wearing a dress, and she had makeup on. 
 All right, that's enough. 
 Can we change the subject, please? 
 Yeah, guys, mind your own business and finish your homework, will you? 
 [Dog barking in distance] Come on. 
 We haven't been out in months. What do you say? 
 Do I really have a choice? 
 No, you do not. 
 Plus, it'll give you an excuse to wear that new dress you got. 
 Yeah, fine. 
 You can help the kids with their homework. 
 I got to get ready. 
 James, good news. 
 You're in charge tonight. Now don't screw up. 
 Gentlemen, as we all well know, it is our job to suppress prostitution in this city. 
 Now, there's some folk down at headquarters that would like us to do a better job. 
 See, that's what happens when the mayor's wife gets accosted by two junkie hookers in the theater district. 
 [Laughter] Therefore, as of tonight, I am assigning you four men to a very important detail. 
 Over the course of the next week, I want us to focus on discouraging the ladies of the evening from selling their wares on certain street corners. 
 Now, I know that we're all aware that we cannot rid this fair city of all of its whores, but we can do our best to shuffle them off of seventh Avenue for the moment, okay? 
 O'Bannon, I want you to ride with Schooly over here. Ah. 
 Bullman, you and Petey Mac ride together. 
 Now, gentlemen, listen. 
 Remember, we must engage the young lady in conversation, which then she will offer to commit a lewd and indecent act. 
 At the time of solicitation, she must express her criminal intent. 
 All right. 
 You see how that works, right, Shea? 
 Yes, sir. 
 She got to offer to suck your little prick, and then you can arrest her. 
 You got that? 
 Yes, sir. 
 She got to offer to suck you off, and then... 
 I place her under arrest. 
 So, your Muldoon's cousin? That's right. 
 It seems like he runs things around here, even though he's not a boss. 
 What's the story there? 
 There is no story. 
 
 
 
 [Engine starts] 
 And you went to Boston college? 
 That's right. 
 What year did you graduate? 
 Didn't. Only lasted a year. 
 I'm a Villanova man myself. 
 So I heard. 
 B.C.'s a good school. What happened? 
 I drink too much, and I got a short temper. 
 [Car horn honks] 
 Are you really leaving? 
 Baby, I'm just doing what I think is right. 
 Susie was my friend. What was I supposed to do, just let her get killed and not do nothing about it? 
 Hey! What about me, huh? 
 What if he came after me? 
 Why don't you ask my cousin to protect you? 
 So you're just gonna run away and leave me here all by myself? 
 Huh? 
 You're gonna leave me here all by my... you know what? Fine, fine. You should leave. Go! 
 [Shouting in Italian] 
 [Baby crying in distance] 
 I'm worried, Rusty. I'm worried. 
 Worried about what? You didn't do anything. 
 That's what I told him. I was there. 
 It was my cab. 
 I mean, his blood's still all over my backseat, and I can't get it out, no matter what I do. 
 What if the cops come looking for me? 
 Anybody who may have seen you has been taken care of. 
 What about that other hooker you said was in the place? 
 You heard what happened to our friend, right? 
 She knows better than to come forward, which leaves only three other witnesses Rogers, me, and you. 
 Now... 
 I really like you, O'Reilly. 
 I do. And I appreciate your concern. 
 But I hope you're not getting so nervous that you're thinking of talking to somebody. 
 No, I was just thinking of all of us... 
 Shh! 
 That... that's all it was. 
 Shh. 
 Let me do the thinking. 
 [Jazz music playing] 
 My lady. 
 Thank you, sir. 
 All right. Now, look, I can't promise you, but hopefully this will be painless tonight. 
 We'll see about that. 
 [Jazz continues] 
 There they are, there. 
 Vincent. 
 Hey, Christine. 
 So nice to see you. Yeah, you too. 
 Mrs. Latucci. 
 Good to see you. 
 As gorgeous as ever. 
 Celeste. 
 Hi. 
 You look lovely. 
 Thank you, but I'm still in shock I'm here. 
 I can't remember the last time I was in the city. 
 Or the last time this one took me out to dinner, let alone the Russian tea room. 
 Yeah, well, I'm sure Vince just doesn't want to share you with the rest of us. 
 Oh, you're a charmer, Irish, but I know his tricks. 
 We've been together long enough to know what I'm in for. 
 Hmm. 
 How long have you guys been together now? 
 Long enough. 
 [Laughs] 
 You are not. 
 You're still in that same apartment, all five of you? 
 Where do you sleep? 
 Oh, it's wonderful. 
 Some people might find it cramped, but it's really not. 
 For example, we have a pullout couch in the main room, and I only have to move the kitchen table a few feet to open it up. All right, that is an exaggeration. 
 It is not that small. 
 It's a one-bedroom. 
 So, where does your daughter sleep? 
 She's in with the boys. 
 But they must be teenagers by now. 
 James just turned 13, all right? 
 Shame on you. 
 Terry, what are you still doing there? 
 According to Vince, you two have been doing very well lately. 
 Overtime helps, but it can only make so much of a difference. [Scoffs] 
 I'm not talking about overtime. Please. 
 I know what you two have been... 
 Hey! 
 Speaking of the kids, Christine, they must be getting big, huh? 
 What are they up to now? 
 You know, they're just the regular, all-American kids obsessed with their dead Uncle who was recently shot down outside a bar a few blocks from their luxurious one-bedroom walk-up apartment. 
 So it's a walk-up, too? 
 Yeah, but at least we're on the top floor. 
 By the way, this is the first time I'm hearing that she's unhappy with the apartment. 
 I mean, all these years, baby. I thought you loved the place. - Mm, I love it. 
 You two should come out to Carroll Gardens and take a look at our place. 
 If Vince can afford a house out there, I don't see why you couldn't, as well. 
 [Siren wailing] Aren't we supposed to be over on Seventh Avenue? 
 Yeah, it doesn't matter. 
 They just want to see the collars. 
 We'll write it up like that's where we pinched 'em. 
 Uh, if that's not a problem with you. 
 [Indistinct conversations, laughter] 
 Look at these two, huh? 
 Couple of good-looking broads, don't you think? 
 Yeah, I guess. 
 I'm always amazed when I see a really good-looking hooker. 
 You know, it's... how did they end up on the street like that? 
 You ever been with a pross? 
 No. 
 Really? 
 Well, personally, I'm not into whores, either. 
 But some of the guys, they love 'em. 
 Maybe not the streetwalker types, but the high end call girls? Whew, Jesus. 
 Talk about some good-looking chicks. 
 I mean, but I figure, you know, why pay for something that I can get for free? 
 Plus, I'm a catholic. 
 It just doesn't seem right, you know? 
 How you gonna confess that to a priest? 
 Bet you still go to mass every Sunday. 
 Yeah, my wife and her family insist on it. 
 Oh, you married one of those holy roller types. 
 She's a real dyed-in-the-wool catholic. 
 But not you, though. 
 From what Petey Mac tells me about Harry Hardware's, you were  all in. 
 All in? 
 That's still to be determined, isn't it? 
 Yeah, it is. 
 How big they are! 
 Hey, Marky, why don't you get off my stoop with your shithead friends? 
 Whoa! 
 [Laughter] 
 Before I kick your ass. 
 What did you find out? 
 Nobody knows where Rusty is, but I know where we can find the other two. 
 They hang out in a joint called the long branch. 
 Yeah, I know the spot. 
 What do you say we take a ride over there right now? 
 Now? No, I can't do it tonight. 
 I got my card game over at Ames'. 
 That's more important than taking care of these assholes? 
 It's my game. I can't not show up. 
 Let's do it tomorrow. 
 All right. I'll see you then. 
 All right? 
 [Engine starts] 
 Now, what's the latest on Mr. O? 
 Well, one of our witnesses conveniently disappeared, and the other, as you heard, took three to the belly, so that's that. 
 They wonder why they call this fun city, right? 
 Yeah. 
 Here's what I'm hoping. 
 Maybe my Uncle was into an L.A. loan shark. 
 They flew somebody into town to take care of him. 
 And as for our hooker, who knows? 
 Maybe she's a spy, and the Russians assassinated her. 
 Because if it's what I think it is, that is trouble we do not need right now. 
 So you're thinking it could be Patton's people? 
 That's what I'm afraid of. 
 So for now, I'm gonna stick with the Russian spy and L.A. loan shark theories. 
 You work in the Nazis, we got it solved. [Laughs] 
 You know what my mother said when I told her Vince proposed? 
 She couldn't believe what a lucky girl you were. 
 Yeah, right. She said, "well, there goes that dream." 
 Christine : And what did she mean by that? 
 Well, the dream that I might one day live a life different than the one I was living had just died. 
 I married a civil servant. 
 He was only ever gonna make so much money. 
 Oh, boy. Here she goes, folks. Get ready. 
 And I would live out my years in a tiny little house in Brooklyn just like the one I grew up in. 
 And my mothers dream that her daughter might one day live on fifth Avenue was over. 
 She's gonna get really deep into the "how I killed her fifth Avenue dream" sob story now, so prepare yourself, Christine. 
 It's true. 
 I could be living right down the street in a doorman building overlooking the park if I didn't meet you. 
 Who the hell were you ever gonna meet that lived in fifth Avenue? 
 And what in your mind makes you believe that they were gonna sweep you up off your feet and bring you up to the penthouse? 
 20 years ago, I could have had anybody I wanted. 
 Absolutely. I'm not denying that. 
 You were a knockout back then. For a fling, maybe. 
 But you're kidding yourself if you think some rich W.A.S.P. 
 Was gonna bring you out to the country house in Southampton to meet his parents, or some millionaire swell in the social register was  ever  gonna put the ring on your finger. 
 I mean, no disrespect, dollface, but that was never gonna happen. 
 No dice. 
 Well, maybe not a millionaire, but I could have married a lawyer or a doctor or a businessman. 
 Or more likely a plumber or a truck driver. 
 Maybe even a barber. 
 How about for once in your goddamn life, you're proud that you're married to a cop? 
 At least we do something that matters. 
 Like what, huh? 
 Locking up hookers and taking money from gamblers? 
 [Laughs] Right. 
 I've had enough of this. Can we get the check, please? 
 [Indistinct conversations] 
 Remind me never to do that again you hump! 
 She's got a big mouth, don't she? 
 No, no, no,  you  got the big mouth. 
 How much have you told her? 
 Nothing. 
 She probably just overhears me on the phone sometimes. 
 Well, then you better stop making calls from home.- Of course. 
 No, no, no, I am being serious, Tucch. 
 All right, she shouldn't have a clue about any of this sh1t. 
 Not a clue. 
 Did you see that? I took two bites. 
 Where's my doggie bag? 
 I know. 
 Did you see the waiter's face when you asked for it? 
 Crazy. I mean, what kind of place doesn't have a doggie bag? 
 I don't understand. 
 I guess they think they're too fancy. 
 Do you guys want a ride home to the West Side? 
 No, no, we'll take a cab. Thank you, though. 
 Okay. Well, good night. 
 Good night. 
 Celeste, always a pleasure. 
 You, too, Irish. 
 Good to see you. Get home safe. 
 Hey. I got it. 
 Not another word. 
 Good man. 
 What do you say, beautiful? 
 Thank you so much for doing that. 
 And I promise you, we will never have dinner with them again, all right? 
 Can I get that in writing? 
 All right, I'm gonna go grab a couple of them. 
 You wait here. 
 You don't need my help? 
 With what? 
 What if they run? 
 [Scoffs] Run? Why the hell would they run?

 Are you at least gonna take us to get something to eat?

 Maybe one of your nights off, you boys ought to come find us. 
 We'll show you a real good time. You know what? 
 Shea just might take you up on that offer, girls. 
 He was just telling me that he's never been with a hooker before.

 I knew enough cops before I met you to know that you're not a Saint. 
 Look, I swear to you. 
 I swear to you, baby, I don't know. 
 If Vince is into some bullshit, that's his business, but that is not my thing. 
 Now, what do you say? You want to take the train home, or you want to walk for a couple blocks? 
 It's a beautiful night. 
 What, like an actual date? You want to hold my hand, too? 
 Yeah, sure, why not? Be like the old days. 
 Remember we used to walk around the city for hours before we had kids? 
 Yeah, those were good times. 
 Yeah, you see, New York isn't so bad, is it? 
 Yeah, sure. If we lived here in Central Park South, life would be grand.

 You don't know where he went? 
 No, I don't. 
 Is he coming back? 
 No, he's not.

 So, you up for one more drink before we call it a night? 
 We'll stop in here, just get one last night cap? 
 Terry, it's late, and I'm tired. 
 Come on, one drink. 
 It'll be the perfect end to this romantic night. 
 I get what you're trying to do, and I appreciate it, but I just want to go home. 
 Indulge me, baby, please. 
 Fine. 
 That's my girl. 
 One drink. 
 Come on, the elevators are right over here.

 Are you gonna tell me who it is we're meeting here? 
 No. It's a surprise.

 And any time there's trouble here, which is a pretty common occurrence in any hotel, he knows he's got someone who will come over immediately and take care of it. 
 Why wouldn't he just call the local precinct? 
 And what, have a couple of jamokes in uniform storm the lobby? No. 
 He wants someone who's gonna come in quietly and discreetly and not disturb his guests.

 I figured I'd be more welcomed over here. 
 Absolutely. Anytime. 
 What was the beef with Smitty? 
 He's not cutting you in on his business? 
 Nah, he's too much of a pansy. Mr. O was his best friend. 
 Best man at his wedding, and what does he do after John gets whacked? 
 Nothing.

 There's some theories out there. 
 I didn't realize you were so tight with old man O'Bannon. 
 Yeah, you didn't know he was like a father to me? 
 Took me in under his wing when I first got to the Kitchen during high school. 
 I was getting my ass kicked every day walking home from school being the new kid. 
 I remember that. I think Rogers here maybe even gave you a beating or two. 
 [Chuckles] I think... I think you might be right. 
 Couldn't have been that bad, though. You're still here. 
 Damn right I am. And as I remember it, you hit like a girl, too, hmm? 
 Anyway, John sees me one day fighting off a bunch of you, sees that I don't take sh1t from nobody and offers me a job at the Pool Hall. 
 And since then, he's always looked out for me. 
 And I've always looked out for him, too. 
 Hmm. 
 Except for that night. 
 Yeah.
