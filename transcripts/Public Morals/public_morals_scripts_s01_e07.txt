 What do you say, Lieutenant? 
 What's up, baby? You tell me, what's the word? 
 It's all there paid in full. 
 I wouldn't expect nothing less from you, Jack. 
 You know I'm never shy, Lonnie. I'm never shy. 
 Listen, I gotta ask you a question. 
 I gotta put another man up. 
 Mickey Liberty on 121st and 1st. 
 I don't know about that, Jack. 
 That's a little too close to Pleasant Avenue. 
 That's Joe Fish's territory. You don't want that headache. 
 No, man, we ain't gonna be doin' his sh1t. 
 We'll be doing our sh1t. 
 But I don't need no trouble from the guineas up there neither. 
 Listen, I'll put the word out to Joe and see what he says. - Solid. 
 Now what's that other thing you said you needed to talk to me about. 
 Frenchie! 
 Go on, tell him. 
 I hate to bother you with this kind of bullshit, but it's my cousin Tina. She asked about you. 
 Yeah? What's she askin'? 
 She wouldn't say. Told me it was none of my business. 
 Said it was important that I got word to you. 
 All right, tell her I'll be in touch. 
 You good? 
 We're good, baby.

 All right, kids, hustle up. You're gonna be late. Let's go. 
 Dad, is mom okay? 
 Yeaah, mom is fine. 
 She's just a little tired, okay? 
 Is she sad about something? 
 Yeah, she's very sad. She wishes your brother James would be a better student. that's not what she's upset about, and you know it. 
 All right, you two, do me a favor, have a wonderful day at school. 
 You with the attitude, stay with me a second. 
 Let's go, Michael, hustle it up. 
 See you, Dad. 
 Close the door. 
 Got it. 
 [Door closes] 
 What'd she say to you? 
 She wants to move. She hates it here. 
 And what about you? You really wanna move to the Suburbs? 
 I don't care. 
 You don't have an opinion one way or the other? 
 What about your friends? You don't think you'd miss them? 
 Most of my friends are gone. 
 [Exhales] All right. 
 So what do you have today? 
 Uh, social studies test. 
 Did you study? 
 Yeah. Remember? 
 You said I couldn't go out last night. 
 That doesn't mean you studied. 
 Yeah, I studied. 
 All right. 
 I'll pick you up after basketball practice today. 
 Okay, can I go now? 
 Sure. Get outta here. 
 Unless, of course, you want a hug and kiss before you go. 
 [Chuckles] 
 [Bottle thuds] 
 Bob Davis worked for me for 20 years, and now he's dead because of you. 
 I didn't tell him to try to shoot it out with the cops. 
 Not just any cop... 
 Terry Muldoon. 
 Whom I do not need as an enemy. 
 I need Mr. Muldoon as a friend. 
 It's all Rusty's bullshit. 
 Every day that dumb sh1t does something to cause me grief. 
 He did what needed to be done. 
 Did he, indeed? [Glass thuds] 
 Why don't you explain it to me? 
 See, I've been trying to wrap my brain around his behavior, and I can't make any sense of it. 
 Here's the thing. 
 No one's ever gonna suspect us of taking Smitty out days after you give him Mr. O.'s book, right? 
 Doesn't make any sense. 
 And because of that, nobody's gonna suspect Rusty... [knocks] 
 Of taking out Mr. O. either, because they're naturally gonna try to connect the two. 
 Except for Mr. O.'s crew, which is why we're gonna take care of them, too. 
 [Laughing] Jesus Christ. 
 And that's your idea of sense? 
 Jesus. 
 Smitty was scared shitless. 
 He was grateful to have his job. 
 And his crew was happy to be workin' for him. 
 And makin' money for all of us. 
 So tell me again, why the hell did he have to kill Smitty? 
 Because, like I said to you before, I knew that Smitty was always gonna be loyal to Mr. O., and his guys, not to us. 
 Jesus Christ, loyal to Mr. O.?! 
 Mr. O. was dead! 
 O'Bannon was dead, killed by Rusty, for Christ sake! 
 It's all bullshit! 
 Bullshit and bloodshed. Too much goddamn bloodshed. 
 And it's smeared all over me. 
 Sometimes, it's the only way to handle these situations, Joe. 
 Remember what the old man always used to say? 
 "You cross a Patton, we cross you off." 
 Our father, our father. 
 The old man is dead. Long dead. And good goddamn riddance. 
 And good riddance to those crazy cowboy days as well. 
 Jesus Christ. 
 Now you listen to me, and get it fairly clear, I'm givin' the orders here. 
 I'm the only one givin' the orders. Do you understand? 
 Come on, Joe. We ain't young like we used to be. 
 You even more so than me. 
 What the hell does that mean? 
 You've had a good long run. 
 Sometimes you gotta read the writing on the wall. 
 The writing on the wall, huh? 
 Why don't you read it to me? 
 Go ahead. Read me the writin' on the wall. 
 I wanna hear it. 
 Yeah. Yeah, I figured as much. 
 Now you listen to me. 
 There's only one person giving the orders around here and that's me. Do you understand? 
 Until further notice, I am the only one who gives orders. 
 [Gunshot] 
 Whoo! 
 Hey, Hopkins, get your ass over here! 
 You need the practice more than me. 
 Oh, Richie, I'm fine, I'm fine. Do your thing. 
 All right. Suit yourself. 
 [Gunshots] 
 Why'd you have to bring him up here? 
 We could've had such a nice time just the two of us. 
 'Cause he's got the car. 
 I could've come pick you up instead. 
 We were in a hurry. 
 How long are you staying for? 
 I don't know. 
 Gotta lay low for a while, though. 
 You're still not gonna tell me what kind of trouble you got yourself into, are you? 
 No, 'cause we ain't in trouble. Quite the opposite. 
 We're the ones causing the trouble. 
 Danny, that isn't funny. 
 I'm serious. Why don't you just... [Gunshots] 
 Just tell him to go back to the city, and you can just stay here with me. 
 'Cause I told you already I can't do that. 
 Me and him got a job that we're workin' on. 
 And if it works out, I'm gonna make a lot more money. 
 And then I'll come back for you. 
 I still wish you didn't bring him. 
 He gives me the creeps. 
 Well, he gives most people the creeps. 
 That's what happens when you're a psycho. [Laughs] 
 [Glass shatters] 
 Whoo! 
 ♪ ♪ 
 What do you say, handy? 
 It's a shame, Muldoon. 
 The Docks ain't what they used to be. 
 Yeah, it seems like everybody in this city's got the same complaint lately. 
 Well, it's true. 
 There are parts of this town I don't recognize anymore. 
 You know when my old man ran the Docks? Forget about it. 
 Hand over fist. I grew up like a rockefeller. 
 All right, don't give me the poor mouth, handy. 
 You forget, I've been to your 4th of July party. 
 I've seen your spread on Long Island. 
 Even so, I'm still gonna have to cut the nut a couple of hundred a month, you know? 
 Given the changing of the times. 
 Hey, you wanna knock a few guys off the list, be my guest. 
 But if the list remains the same, so does the nut. 
 [Sighs] I swear, you hump, I feel like I'm dealing with your old man all over again. 
 See, and I thought we were old friends. 
 What are you tryin' to do? Hurt my feelings here? 
 Nah. 
 Oh, I heard about Bob Davis. What happened there? 
 You know, Davis got what he deserved. 
 He's the one that knocked off Mr. O.? 
 Who ever said anything about that? 
 Why else would you kill him? 
 Oh, if I did kill him, which I did not, it would imply I gave a sh1t about Mr. O., which I did not. 
 No, Davis died because he broke the number one rule... he shot a cop. 
 I'll see you next month. 
 All good? 
 Same old, same old. 
 And unlike your friend Tedesco, I didn't have to twist his arm. 
 Ah, don't worry about the moose. He learned his lesson. 
 He'll have his money today. 
 Well, what about you, Tucch? You learned your lesson? 
 What the hell's that supposed to mean? 
 It means Johanson is concerned about you and your relationship with Tedesco. 
 Jesus Christ, Terry, I would... I would never do anything to screw you guys, you gotta know that. What the hell is the matter with him? 
 I know, I know, it's not just him. 
 There's also people downtown that are worried. 
 Yeah, but they don't understand how we do things in little Italy. It's different. 
 I'm just tellin' ya, all right? 
 That's a warning. You should know. 
 But what about the guy that did this to you? 
 You said they found him? 
 Yeah, Mr. Muldoon, uh, they caught up with him last night. 
 And what happened? 
 What do you think happened? 
 Uh, I don't know. Did they arrest him? 
 Just saying he can't be shooting cops no more. 
 [Speaks german] 
 It's okay, Mom. 
 So what does that mean? Is he... is he dead? 
 I thought you said this kid was smart. 
 Daddy, don't. But I don't understand. 
 Why would someone try to kill you? 
 Come on, sweetheart, these people are crazy out there. 
 It ain't the first time someone didn't love the idea of going back to jail. 
 I don't wanna talk about that. I wanna talk about you. 
 How are you, sweetheart, huh? 
 How's everything going with the wedding planning? 
 Well, that's actually something we wanted to talk to you about, sir. 
 Oh, excuse me, excuse me. Was I talkin' to you? 
 I'm talkin' to my daughter. 
 When I'm talkin' to my daughter, don't interrupt. 
 Well, we were thinking that instead of having the wedding in our parish, we could have it at Ryan's church. 
 And that way we could use his uncle's restaurant for the reception, and it would save you a lot of money. 
 No, I... he would give us a very good deal. 
 I could get my own deals if I want. 
 You... you were baptized at St. Joseph's, you were confirmed at St. Joseph's, you're gettin' married at St. Joseph's. 
 All right, that's the way it is. 
 You're gonna get your grandmother upset about this. 
 Is he always like that? 
 Ryan, he just got shot. 
 Yeah, yeah, I know, Agnes. 
 Okay, but he doesn't have to be so stubborn. 
 We're doin' this for him. 
 We're trying to save  him  money so you can get the wedding  you  want. 
 Well, maybe we need to rethink that. 
 Like you said, it's my wedding. 
 [Under breath] Yeah. 
 [Doorbell rings] 
 Coming!

 Hmm. Let me put 'em in water. 
 Okay. 
 Huh. 
 Been a long time since I've been in this apartment. 
 Yeah. 
 I guess it has, hasn't it? 
 You remember the last time? [Vase thuds] 
 How could I forget? 
 It's the night before you went away. 
 Yeah. 
 Thinking about you is the only thing that made my time bearable. 
 [Sighs] Um, can I get you something to drink? 
 I haven't had a drink since that night. 
 Um... 
 What about you? 
 You been thinkin' about me all these years? 
 Are you kiddin' me? Of course I have. 
 But we had to end it when we did. 
 Yeah. 
 What about now? 
 I don't... I don't know. 
 Why not, Kay? We've waited long enough. 
 I want to, Rusty, but it's just... it's too soon. 
 Okay. 
 Then I'll come back tomorrow. [Chuckles]

 Hey. 
 How are you, Lonnie? 
 I'm fine. It's been a while. 
 Yeah, it has. Uh, you look well. 
 And you look as beautiful as ever. 
 Thank you. And thank you for meeting me at work... 
 Oh, for you? 
 And on such short notice. 
 Oh, anytime. 
 Can we talk in here? 
 Absolutely, come on. 
 Let me get that. 
 Thanks. 
 So what's goin' on? 
 You in some kind of trouble or something? 
 No, it's not me. It's my son Thomas. 
 Thomas? What the hell kind of trouble can that kid get into? 
 You know the brill building? 
 Yeah, of course. I... you remember I worked midtown north. 
 10 years. I was always getting called in there to get somebody out of a jam drugs, booze, fighting, always something with those musicians. 
 But what's this have to do with Thomas? 
 Well, he's been workin' there the last few months. 
 Getting session work playing guitar. 
 Out of sight. He always had a good ear. 
 What's the problem? 
 Well, he met some girl, some backup singer. 
 Started messin' around. 
 Thomas says they're in love, but the girl's got another man. 
 Sound like somebody else you might know? 
 Lonnie, please, I already explained to you a thousand times... 
 Okay, okay, I know. You're right. 
 Just tell me what happened. 
 Well, you know Thomas wouldn't hurt a fly. 
 He's not that kind of a boy. He's not a... he's not a tough guy, you know. 
 But this man found out about him and the girl. 
 [Voice breaking] And he broke both of Thomas's hands. 
 He smashed them with a hammer. 
 And now Thomas might never be able to play again. 
 [Crying] And I... 
 Okay, okay, okay. 
 I'll take care of it. 
 [Sobs] 
 Just tell me this asshole's name. 
 What's his name? 
 Sonny Blue. Have you heard of him? 
 Sonny Blue? That piece of sh1t. Of course I've heard of him. 
 Listen, don't you worry about this, all right? 
 You take care of Thomas and I'm-a make sure this is taken care of, all right? 
 Don't you worry about this. I got it. 
 Give us a minute, will you? 
 What do you say, dollface? 
 Don't sweet-talk me, Vince. I'm mad at you. 
 You're mad at me? 
 Mm-hmm. 
 [Chuckles] All right, I'll play along. 
 What are you mad at me for? 
 I haven't heard from you. 
 That's 'cause I thought you didn't wanna hear from me. 
 After our drive, I got the impression you weren't interested. 
 That doesn't mean we can't still be friends. 
 What kind of friend are you lookin' for? 
 I don't know yet. You still could've called. 
 Didn't you have a good time that night? 
 Yeah, sure. 
 We could've had a hell of a lot more fun if you were willing. 
 You need to learn to be patient, Vince. 
 No, I'm done being patient. 
 Being patient with your uncle is what gets me into hot water.

 She tire of your charms? 
 It's exactly the opposite. 
 Now she wants me to call her. She gets me nuts, this one. 
 Yeah, well, she must be a glutton for punishment. 
 Let me take a look at that. 
 Terry, are you kidding me? 
 What do you think? I skimmed between there and the car? 
 Thought never crossed my mind until you said it right now. 
 I just wanna check if your friend Tedesco's being honest. 
 Terry, what the hell's goin' on here? 
 I mean, you gotta be square with me. 
 Am I on the outs or what? 
 Look, what do you want me to say, Vince? 
 You know it's not my decision, but I would be lying to you if I told you your future wasn't in jeopardy. 
 So let's say grandpa's making alcohol in his basement, right? 
 Um, now it wouldn't be a problem, but back then in, like, the 1790s, it would be a problem because all the citizens didn't want the tax, and so they rebelled against it. 
 [Telephone rings] 
 Because, um... all right, that's all very interesting. 
 Go answer the phone. 
 [Rings] 
 Muldoon residence. This is Michael speaking. 
 Oh, hello Michael. It's your grandmother. Is your mother there? 
 Yeah, she's right here. One sec. It's grandma. 
 Go finish your homework. 
 Hello? 
 Christine, it's me, Ina. Is Terry there? 
 No, he's, uh, still at work, but he should be home soon. 
 Oh, good. I wanted to discuss something with you privately. 
 Is this, uh, is now a good time? 
 Yeah, of course. What is it? 
 I know you and Mr. Muldoon spoke about lookin' for a place near us. Unfortunately, I don't think there's anything in your price range up here. 
 But I do have a friend selling a house, uh, out in queens, and I think it... it might be perfect for ya. 
 In Queens? Oh, my God. Do you really? 
 Yeah. Why don't you and I, uh, why don't you take a drive out there tomorrow? What time's Terry go to work? 
 Uh, he probably leaves around 8:00. Does that work? 
 Yeah, it's perfect. I'll pick you up at 10:00. 
 Thank you. I'll see you tomorrow. 
 Good. See you then. 
 [Coins clink] 
 [Rotary dial whirring] 
 [Telephone rings] 
 Muldoon. 
 Hey, Muldoon. It's me, Duffy. 
 I think I got something for ya. 
 [Chuckles] Isn't that amazing how that happens? 
 Threaten to throw somebody's ass in jail, and all of a sudden they're very cooperative. So what do you got, Duff? 
 Listen, so I go and see Rusty, like you asked me to, and Rusty tells me to go find Richie Kane, but he asked me not to tell anybody. 
 So then I find out Kane has skipped town, right? 
 And here's the reason why. Ready? 
 They're the ones that killed Rogers and O'Reilly. 
 And on his way out of the long branch that night, he tells the bartender Rusty's next. 
 And this is why, and I'm just guessin' here, but Rusty and those two mopes are the ones who killed Mr. O. 
 And it makes perfect sense because Richie Kane is like a son to Mr. O., right? 
 Oh, okay. 
 So maybe you're not as friggin' stupid as I've been giving you credit for all these years. 
 This is actually something I could use. 
 Yeah, thanks, Muldoon. 
 So you think maybe you can tell that detective, you know, I had nothing to do with it, right? 
 All right, consider it done. 
 I'll be in touch. 
 Thanks. Yeah, talk to you soon. 
 
 
 
 [Birds chirping, dog barks in distance] 
 I don't understand. 
 Why do you have to go down to the city anyhow? 
 Why couldn't you just stay at home with me? 
 'Cause I was bored out of my friggin' mind up here. 
 You were bored? 
 Yeah. 
 Yeah, you're bored with me? 
 No, not you. I didn't wanna work for my father, get my ass kicked every day on that farm. 
 Yeah, but then you could have me any old time you want. 
 You wouldn't have to go chase all those dirty New York City girls. 
 You know I don't want anybody but you, right? 
 Yeah, but that didn't keep you from messing around with them, now did it? 
 Nobody down there means anything to me. 
 You know I would never look at another woman if you'd come back with me. 
 [Sighs] You know I can't leave my mother. 
 What if we got married? 
 Are you messin' with me? 
 Am I messing... no. 
 Don't mess with me. 
 What are you you talking about? Let's get married. 
 You really mean it? 
 Yeah, baby. 
 [Laughing] 
 [Both moaning] 
 Ah-Whoo! 
 Hey, get outta here, you asshole! 
 I told you he was a creep. 
 [Laughs] 
 Ah. 
 [Ducks quacking in distance] 
 [Mutters] 
 [Rusty whistles] 
 Hey, where the hell you been all day? 
 I, uh... 
 I went to go see Kay today. 
 Why the hell would you go and do that, Rusty? 
 You don't wanna start that up again. 
 That doesn't concern you, Uncle Red. 
 No, no, this is about people gettin' suspicious about what really happened. 
 This is... this is motive. 
 I don't give a sh1t. 
 I did what I did because of her. 
 You don't give a sh1t. Jesus Christ. 
 Hey, enough about my love life. What about Kane and Hopkins? 
 You find out anything about them? 
 Kane and Hopkins? Rusty... 
 I got everybody in town working on it, all our guys. 
 They haven't seen or heard from 'em, which, in my opinion, is a good thing. 
 Now how you figure that? 
 Because we don't need any more killing right now. 
 We didn't need to kill Smitty and Sully. 
 That was your personal sh1t. 
 And then Bob Davis gets it because of that and brings the cops in. 
 You know, this is putting all the rest of our stuff in jeopardy, because of your personal stuff. 
 Now you sound like my father. [Scoffs] 
 Yeah? Well, he's still the boss, isn't he? 
 And he's worried, Rusty. 
 And you wanna know somethin'? So am I. 
 What? Are you kiddin' me? 
 You squarin' up to me? 
 You told me to take this all the way. 
 Guess what? 
 This is what all the way looks like. 
 So stop your worrying. 
 Oh, Terry. 
 You look beautiful, Mrs. Bullman. 
 How's the big guy holding up? 
 [Speaks german] 
 [Door closes] 
 Don't worry about it, Mom, please. I got it. I got it. 
 Hey, you two, make yourselves scarce. 
 What do you say, boys? How's school treatin' ya? 
 Pretty good. 
 Good, good. 
 What about you, you big kraut? 
 How's it going? 
 I'm good. I'm good. 
 I got it, Mom. 
 Thank you, my love. 
 She's never gonna let me leave that one down, huh? 
 So, uh, what's this big news you got for me? 
 All right. 
 You know the two skells who were stabbed over at the long branch? 
 Rogers and O'Reilly? 
 Yeah. 
 Both of those guys work for Rusty. 
 Both of them were killed a couple of days after Mr. O. got his. 
 That is no coincidence. 
 So you think Rusty and those two mutts killed mr O.? 
 Yeah, and then I think Mr. O.'s muscle... the kid, Richie Kane... he goes and he gets his revenge, and he's the one that kills Rogers and O'Reilly. 
 Right. And Rusty ain't gonna stand for that. 
 He kills Smitty and Sully, probably with the help of Davis. 
 Yeah, which is why Davis sh1ts the bed with us. 
 All right. Now all those guys worked for Mr. O., but now we got ourselves a full-scale war. 
 That makes sense. 
 Yeah. 
 But all of this is impossible to prove. 
 Yeah, well, let me ask you a question. 
 Why would they kill Smitty? He works for Patton. 
 That I haven't been able to put together. 
 But, then again, we are not dealing with highly intelligent individuals here. 
 That's right. 
 We're dealing with irrational, impulsive, usually completely shit-faced drunken lunatics. 
 Yeah, well, you know what my father used to say when he worked homicide? 
 "Eliminate all logic from the equation and start from there," especially when you're dealing with the Irish. 
 [Chuckles] 
 But here's a question. 
 How does Patton figure into all of this? 
 Well, without any witnesses and without any proof, he's the only one who can put an end to this war. 
 Well, you need to sit down with Patton and convince him to do so. 
 This sh1t is gettin' out of hand. 
 [Horn honks] 
 [Horn honks, car door closes] 
 He'll be right out. 
 Hey, listen, I just wanted to say thanks for taking care of us. 
 Yeah, sure. Anytime. 
 Oh really? Anytime? 
 All right, blondie, I'm gonna hold you to that. 
 [Door creaks] 
 Danny, this is crazy. 
 I don't understand why you have to leave, especially now. 
 Oh, baby. Don't get upset, all right? 
 Please. Please don't go. 
 I promise, once we take care of this, I'll be back. 
 Look, you know you don't have to, right? 
 Just tell him. Just... just tell him that you gotta stay.

 No, look, Danny, I-I just... I got a really bad feeling.

 You gonna be around tomorrow? 
 Who knows? 
 What do you say, boys? 
 James, don't look so scared. 
 You're not in any trouble at least, not yet. 
 So how'd you do on that social studies test? 
 Good, I think. 
 Well, you either knew the answers or you did not know the answers. 
 If you knew the answers, you did good. 
 If you did not know the answers, then you failed. 
 So which one was it? 
 I knew the answers. 
 Very good. 
 You see what happens when we apply ourselves? 
 Now what do you think? You and your bodies might want some tickets to the next Knick game tomorrow night? 
 Yeah, I think we'd love it. 
 All right. And that's what we'll do. 
 I'm proud of you. Go catch up to those knuckleheads.

 It's like your jump shot. 
 If you put in the hard work, it will pay off.

 Tell him about the car thief you mowed down in Inwood. 
 I was just doing my job, Uncle Lonnie. 
 Doing your job? 
 He hit that punk square in the middle of the forehead from 40 yards away with a .357 Magnum. 
 Son, what the hell you doing carrying that kind of gun? 
 Well, I find it's pretty accurate. 
 [Laughs] 
 Roy, the detective here is part of that special detail we was talking about. 
 I just wanna make sure you're down with what we discussed.

 It's not a good idea, Rusty. 
 Best to leave this one alone. 
 What are you talking about? 
 You taking the big guy's side all of a sudden? 
 I'm not taking any sides. I'm just telling you we need to let things settle down a little bit. 
 You sure about that? 'Cause it sounds like you're taking sides.

 You sons of bitches don't know who you're messing with. 
 [Grunting] 
 Can't play guitar with two broken hands, and you can't sing with a broken jaw. 
 And you damn sure can't dance with a broken leg. 
 I don't want him walking out of here. 
 You heard the man.

 I think you might be right. 
 [Labored breathing] 
 [Soft thud] 
 [Murmurs] 
 [Knock on door] 
 Who is it? 
 [Door bangs open] [Screams] 
 Shut your whore mouth. 
 [Beads clatter] 
 Where the hell is Richie Kane? 
 He's not here. 
 But he's coming back, and when he does, you're a dead man. 
 Oh, I think you got that all wrong, sweetheart. 
 See, your friend Richie's the one who's not long for this world. 
 You think you're some kind of a tough guy? 
 [Speaks spanish] 
 You shot and killed a woman. 
 What kind of a tough guy is that? 
 You got a mouth on you. 
 You just don't like what I'm saying 'cause I'm speaking the truth. 
 Your dad... he knows the code. 
 You're not supposed to kill regular people, and you're especially not supposed to kill women. 
 I do things a little different from my father. 
 So what are you gonna do? 
 Shoot me, too? 
 Nah. 
 I'm not gonna shoot you.
