 All right. Use this one right here... anybody gives you any sh1t, you blow the back of their head right off. 
 Nobody gives me any sh1t. 
 [Chuckles] Of course not. And you gotta know, my man, this here is all dependable shoot right here. 
 Every last one of these guns is untraceable. 
 [Gun clicks] 
 Clean like a goddamn whistle. 
 And if you don't like any of this sh1t, I could bring you some other sh1t. 
 You know what I'm saying? .22s, .38s, .45s, berettas. 
 Big old six-shooter. Whatever you need, I got it. 
 I like this one. 
 That's a nice choice. 
 Plain and simple. Steady and true. 
 Can never go wrong with a Smith & Wesson. 
 [Gun clatters, bills rustle] 
 All right. Good doing business with you. 
 Mm-hmm. 
 Now if you need anything in terms of firepower, you let me know. 
 You need shotguns, I got shotguns. 
 You need hand grenades, machine guns, explosives. 
 You let me know. I got it. 
 You wanna blow up a goddamn car, I'll set you up. Give you no sh1t to send a car over the river into New Jersey, no sweat. 
 [Click] We're done here. 
 All right.  You need anything, you know where to find me. 
 Yes, I do. 
 [Chuckles] 
 [Chuckles] 
 Yeah. 
 [Cocks gun] 
 [Click] [Whispers] Pow. 
 [Horn honks] 
 [Engine rumbling] 
 [Brakes squeal] 
 [Banging on door] 
 [Knock on door] 
 Sean, it's your cousin! Open up. 
 One second! I just gotta put on some drawers. 
 [Lowered voice] Go inside, and don't come out until I tell ya. 
 All right, I'm coming. 
 Hey. 
 Please tell me you're not that friggin' stupid. 
 Because I need to know if I put my trust... 
 [Door closes] 
 In a complete moron. 
 I don't know what you're talking about. 
 You have no idea what I'm talking about? 
 No, you told me to cut off things with Duffy, and I did. 
 Do you take me for some kind of jerkoff, and did something happen between your mother and father last night? 
 No. No. Why? What are you getting at? 
 If you got something you need to tell me, you can tell me, okay? I will go to the grave with it. 
 But I need to know right now. 
 Terry, I swear, I have no idea what the hell you're talking about. Now what happened? 
 [Sighs] 
 Somebody got to your father last night. 
 [Refrigerator door closes] They pulled him out of the east river a couple of hours ago. [Can fizzes] 
 How about that? 
 Yeah, how about that? [Slurps] 
 Somebody did my dirty work for me. 
 Hey. I need a straight answer right now. 
 If you did this, I can make it go away, but in order to do that, I need the truth, and I want it right now. 
 Terry... I give you my word. 
 I had no part in it. 
 [Horn honks in distance] 
 But I will drink to it. 
 [Horns honking, siren wailing] 
 [Coins clatter] 
 [Dialing] 
 [Telephone rings] 
 [Groans] 
 [Ring] 
 Hello? 
 Hey, T. It's me, Suzie. 
 Um, I'm sorry to call this early. 
 I'm just s-so scared to go home. 
 Can I come over to your place? 
 Why? What's wrong? 
 I'll tell you when I see you. 
 Can I come over, please? 
 Depends. What's going on? 
 I... Saw something I shouldn't have seen. 
 Just tell me what happened, Suze. 
 I saw Mr. O. get killed last night. 
 Holy sh1t. Where'd it happen? 
 Jesus Christ, I will tell you when I see you. 
 Can I come over, please, T.? 
 Okay. Yeah. 
 I think his place is up here, right? 
 Ah, there's the mope now. 
 Look at him. 
 Smitty! 
 [Speaks indistinctly] I'm outta here. 
 [Brakes squeal] Hey! 
 [Engine turns off] Yo, Smitty. 
 What do you say, asshole, huh? 
 Hey. 
 What do you know, Smitty? Huh? What do you got? 
 I don't know nothin'. Nothin'. Not yet. Not yet. 
 Nothin', huh? Not a clue, huh? 
 Yeah, uh, I don't know... 
 Look, I just found out myself a few hours ago, man. 
 I'm in shock. He was a friend of mine. 
 Mr. O. was my friend. 
 I don't know who would do somethin' like this to him. 
 Yeah, because he was such a prince of a guy, right? 
 Yeah, take a stab in the dark. 
 You know... you know, not for nothin', maybe it was your cousin Sean. 
 Are you lookin' to get your teeth knocked in, Smitty? 
 What's the matter with you, huh? You ain't got no other brilliant ideas? 
 Duffy... that kid Duffy... 
 Hey, stop jerking us off! 
 He was in the pool hall... 
 Hey! 
 He had words with Mr. O. a couple of days ago. 
 I know my uncle was getting restless. 
 I know he was unhappy with the arrangement you guys had with the big guy. 
 And I'm wondering, do you think Patton found out about that? 
 Why would you think that? 
 Because he told me you dopes were thinking about making a move. 
 I wasn't thinking anything like that. 
 I told him it was a bad idea. 
 It was that kid, Richie Kane. 
 He was putting all that bullshit, talking about taking over. 
 I do not give a sh1t whose idea it was. 
 Did something happen to give Patton a reason to whack him? 
 No, not that I know of. 
 Well, I hope not for your sake, 'cause the last thing any of us need is some kind of bullshit war. 
 Yeah, a war that youse can't possibly win. 
 You understand that, right, dummy? 
 [Horns honking in distance] 
 You hear somethin', Smitty, you be in touch. 
 I couldn't agree more, Terry. You know I'm a gambler. 
 You know me. I'm just in it for the money. 
 [Car doors close] 
 Grandpa? 
 I'm in here, sweetheart. 
 Can I have some money to go away with friends this weekend? 
 Well, that depends upon where you're going. 
 We're going to Saratoga to visit Jane at school. 
 Ha! You're hanging with your... proddie aristocratic friends again, are ya? 
 You're the one who sent me to Spence. 
 Oh. 
 And I promise I won't get into trouble again. 
 Oh, don't promise me that. You're a Patton. 
 You'll be always getting into trouble. 
 You wanna promise me something, promise me you won't get caught. 
 Of course, Grandpa. I learned my lesson. 
 Ah, oh, sure you did. 
 Thank you. 
 Be careful. 
 Mm-hmm. Well, if it isn't Laurel and Hardy. 
 Yeah, good mornin' to you, too, Rose. 
 [Groans] Of all the nutjobs and head cases I've dealt with over the years, she's the one that'll be the death of me. 
 Where the hell is Rusty? 
 I couldn't find him this mornin'. 
 And you want me to give him more responsibility. 
 If he wasn't my son, we'd have been done with him long ago. 
 Yeah, no, he's just been out a couple of months. 
 Give him a break. 
 Stop making goddamn excuses for him. 
 He's an irresponsible sh1t, and you know it. 
 How the hell do you think he went to jail in the first place? 
 All right. What do you know about this Mr. O. situation? 
 Nothing yet. 
 What about our friends in homicide? 
 They got nothin'. 
 And you got nothin', too? 
 I got my guys looking into it. 
 Well, we'd better find out something fast. 
 Mr. O. may have been an asshole, but it's gonna look bad if we don't deal with this promptly. 
 We got any leads? 
 Nothing yet, but the guy had a long list of enemies. 
 Yeah, he made new ones every day. 
 You gotta have some ideas, Terry. 
 Yeah, I got a few, but quite honestly, as far as I'm concerned, he dug his own grave a long time ago. 
 What does Sean say about him? 
 Sean feels the same way I do. 
 His father was a piece of sh1t, and he got what he deserved. 
 Regardless, the boss wants you to work with Battalina to find out who's behind this. 
 We don't need this to blow up on us. 
 I got no problem with that. Tony B. is a friend. 
 Listen, we gotta talk to Patton's people, find out who's stepping in for him. 
 It's gonna be his son Rusty now that he's back in the picture. 
 Nah, nah, nah. 
 Don't be so sure of that. 
 Rusty's a leg breaker. He's not a businessman. 
 Bull, you and I will take a ride over there later today. 
 We'll see what we can find out. 
 But either way, let's hope this is an isolated incident, not the start of something bigger. 
 Your mouth to God's ears. 
 Another thing... Bull, I want you to tag along with Petey Mac and Shea tonight, try to get to know him. 
 Just try to get a better read on what we're dealing with here. 
 Didn't I already tell you guys this kid's a jerkoff? 
 And I think I said the kid was okay. 
 Look, Terry, I'm not looking to rock the boat here. 
 I know you say you had the talk with the kid, and you think he's okay. 
 But you still have some concerns. 
 No, I'm just saying we're not there yet. 
 Yeah, there's too much at stake here, Terry. 
 All right, why don't you take him to Harry Hardware's tonight? 
 All right? I'll meet up with you guys afterwards. 
 We'll give him a taste. We'll see how the kid responds. 
 Good enough? 
 Good enough. 
 [Horns honking] 
 [Coins clatter, telephone bell dings] 
 [Dialing] 
 [Telephone rings] 
 Muldoon. 
 Terry, Tony Battalina here. 
 Tony B.! 
 So I heard you caught my uncle's case. 
 Who did you piss off? 
 Yeah, yeah, I ain't too happy about it either. 
 I just spent the entire day in Hell's Kitchen. 
 I'm ready to kill myself. 
 I couldn't find a decent meal anywhere. 
 [Laughs] 
 Well, then you obviously haven't been drinking enough. What do you got? 
 18th got a call last night reporting gunshots around 2:00 A.M. outside Arthur's Grill. 
 You know the place? 
 Yeah, yeah, yeah, it's actually a couple of blocks from my apartment. 
 They got a good-lookin' crowd there, don't they? 
 Yeah, sure, if you like fat broads with no teeth. 
 Look, I spoke to the bartender, but this hump... he's got no recollection of your uncle being in there last night or about hearing gunshots fired outside his front door, but he is willing to admit that Mr. O. did stop in there from time to time. 
 Oh, nice work. I'm surprised you got that much out of him. 
 Yeah, well, fortunately, the hookers that hang out in the joint were a little more willing to talk. 
 Yeah, well, clearly, they have no allegiance to the neighborhood code. What did they say? 
 Terry, I'd take it with a grain of salt, okay? 
 But they said Mr. O. was in there last night with a couple of whores, and they saw the whole thing, and not one of 'em is running scared. 
 Yeah, well, it's still early, Tony. 
 If anybody can find a hooker on the run, it's you. 
 Hey, you know what? Shove it up your ass, Muldoon. 
 It was just one blow job. 
 Yeah. So said the bishop to the altar boy. 
 Look, I've done some asking around today, too, and I got nothin'. 
 What do you say we meet at Pop's later, and you can fill me in on what you find out? 
 All right, sure. You got it. [Coins clatter] 
 [Horns honking, siren wailing in distance] 
 Thanks. 
 Are you sure it was him? 
 Of course I'm sure. 
 Did he see you? 
 No, we were hiding in the backseat of Mr. O.'s car when it happened. 
 Who's "we"? Who were you with? 
 You don't know her. It's my friend Judy. 
 He told us to wait for her... for him in his car, and... and then when he came out a little while later, that's when it happened. 
 And where's this Judy now? 
 I don't know. 
 As soon as they left, she took off running. 
 Do you trust her not to talk? 
 I don't really know. 
 This is serious, Suze. 
 You've got to keep this sh1t to yourself. 
 You think I don't know that? 
 Can I just stay here for a couple of days? 
 You know, I really don't wanna go back to my place. 
 No, I'm... I think that's a bad idea. 
 Look, if I was you, I would go to Port authority and get on a bus right now. 
 What? What, you want me to just leave right now? 
 When they find out I saw it, they will kill me. 
 I know, and they'll kill me, too, if they find you here. 
 You've gotta go. 
 Are you serious right now? 
 I'm serious. 
 [Whispers] Sorry. 
 Sorry. Sorry. You're sorry. You're so sorry, you're kicking me out of your apartment. This is bullshit! 
 This is  bullshit! 
 You gotta promise me... you gotta promise me you won't tell a soul. 
 Hey! You won't tell nobody... 
 I won't tell nobody, but you have got to get outta here, like out of New York. 
 [Whispers] Sorry. 
 T... 
 Oh, no. He's still here? 
 Yes. He got up, walked through the kitchen naked. 
 [Sighs] Used the bathroom, and then went back and fell asleep on the couch. 
 Babs, I'm so sorry. 
 I'm gonna get him outta here right now, okay? I promise. 
 Hey, Patrick! 
 Huh? 
 Let's go. Come on. Get up. Let's go. 
 Whoa. Hey, D., good morning. 
 No, do not "good morning" me. It's noon. 
 Get up! Put your clothes on. 
 Yeah, bah, bah, bah, bah, bah! 
 Hey, I wanna talk to you about your roommate. 
 Talk about a good-lookin' broad. 
 What's her story? Is she single? 
 I met her earlier. She seemed interested. 
 Yes, I'm still here, and I'm single, and I'm absolutely 100% not interested. 
 Whoa, hey! Hello again, gorgeous. 
 Sorry about the peep show before. 
 Actually, it wasn't much of a show. [Laughs] 
 Midnight show is better. 
 [Telephone rings] 
 I'm going to work. 
 I promise he's not gonna be here when you get back, okay? 
 Hello? 
 Hey, D., it's me, Sean. 
 Oh, hi, Sean. 
 Wait. How'd he get this number? 
 Because I gave it to him, that's why. 
 Give me the phone. Give me the phone. 
 Seany, Seany, Seany, hey, listen, I thought we had a deal about my sister. 
 Uh, no, you asked me for a favor, and seeing as you screwed me over on the last favor you asked of me, I'm not doing you any more favors. 
 So put her back on the phone. 
 This ain't right, Beantown. This ain't right at all. 
 Put her back on the phone, Duff. 
 [Horns honking in distance] 
 Hello? 
 Hey. 
 Sorry. I don't mean to bother you, but, uh, I didn't know who else to call. 
 No, it's fine. What's going on? 
 My father was killed last night. 
 What? 
 Oh, my God. 
 Sean, I'm so sorry. Are you okay? 
 Yeah. I'm... gonna go down to the corner and get started. 
 Wondered if you would join me. 
 Well, shouldn't you be with your mother? 
 Well, I'm here at her apartment now, and for the last hour, I've heard her go on and on about what a great guy my father was, and now I need a drink. 
 When do you wanna meet? 
 Soon as I hang up the phone, I'm walking out the door. 
 Well, how about we get some lunch instead? 
 How about that, huh? 
 Well, that's a good idea. 
 I'll order you a hard-boiled egg and a liverwurst sandwich. 
 I'll see you when you get there. [Hangs up receiver] 
 [Receiver clatters] What happened? 
 His father was killed last night. 
 What a tragedy. 
 Can't imagine who would wanna kill  that  guy.

 L.C. Cooke : ♪ I'm gonna have me a good time ♪

 Drowning your sorrows? 
 [Chuckles] Just the opposite. 
 I'm celebrating my spoils. 
 Get this girl a shot of whiskey. 
 I'll have a beer. 
 And a shot of whiskey. 
 How you doin'? 
 How am I doin'? I'm doin' great. 
 Somebody just did me a huge favor. 
 Come on, Sean. I know he wasn't a great guy, but he's still your... 
 No, no, he wasn't a great guy. 
 In fact, he was a complete and utter mother... 
 Ugh. I'm sorry. 
 [Exhales] I'm sorry. My apologies. 
 You're... you're a lady, and I should not be using that kind of language in front of you. 
 It's all right. I've heard worse, as you know. 
 But you're right. You're absolutely right. 
 He was not a great guy, and that's why we're gonna do six shots of whiskey to the six shots that did him in. 
 And now if you would be so kind, I'd like to propose a toast to bullet number one. 
 Sean, I don't think it's right. 
 D., this is a guy... [Glass clatters] who regularly beat the sh1t out of his wife... a wife, mind you, that only married the miserable son of a bitch because he got her pregnant when she was 16. 
 So you, as a woman, have every right to drink to his demise.

 Well, I still don't think it's right.

 What about the next five? 
 I got it. 
 Rusty, couple cops are on their way up. 
 They're in the elevator now. 
 Don't worry about it, Rogers. We'll take care of 'em. 
 Well, well, well, look who's back. 
 How you doin', fellas? What can we do for you? 
 Well, maybe you didn't hear, but my uncle got whacked last night. I figured I should come by and see his boss, see what he knows. 
 Big guy's not here today. 
 Yeah. 
 I can see that, asshole. Where is he? 
 At church mourning the loss of his dear friend, maybe. 
 I don't know if he's mournin', but he's not happy about it, that's for sure. None of us are. 
 So what'd you need to see my father about? 
 Nah, ain't nothin' that concerns you, dickhead. 
 Anything you need to talk to my father about, you can talk to me. 
 Are you the boss now? 
 Or you just playing make-believe behind the old man's desk? 
 Yeah, I didn't think so. So do me a favor. 
 Tell your old man that he and I have some business we need to discuss. 
 I hope you learned your lesson, Rusty, all right? 
 'Cause there's always eyes watching ex-cons, and I'm gonna be watching  you,  asshole. 
 Don't need to worry about me, boys. 
 I'm on the straight and narrow now. 
 No more drinkin', clean livin'. I'm a different man. 
 Ain't that right, uncle Red? 
 Oh, that's right. Straight as an arrow, just like his uncle. 
 Hmm. Red, you're obviously the brains of this operation. 
 Tell your big brother we need to speak. 
 Let's go, Bull. 
 Good to see you, Red. 
 You, too, Bull. 
 [Under breath] Prick. 
 By the look of that haircut, you must be Shea. 
 How you doin'? Pete McGuinness, but everybody calls me "Petey Mac." 
 Hey, how are you, Pete? Jimmy Shea. 
 I'm good. 
 But like I just said, it's Petey Mac, not Pete. 
 Now grab your sh1t. 
 You're riding with me and Bullman tonight. 
 And I'll give you fair warning. 
 He's already got a hard-on for you. 
 [Under breath] What else is new? 
 Shea, Bull. Bull, Shea. 
 So this is the boss' kid? Good, that's what we need. 
 Another Irish asshole on the team. 
 Get in the back. 
 [Siren wailing in distance] 
 [Engine starts] 
 [Tires squeal] This way. 
 So, listen, Shea, tonight we're just gonna grab a few cocktails and get a chance to get to know you a little better, all right? 
 Sure. Sounds good. I look forward to it. 
 Yeah, well, that makes one of us. 
 You know, I had a drink with Carl Shultz the other night. 
 He says he worked the gambling car with you uptown. 
 Mm-hmm. Yeah. He also says you ain't got no balls. 
 Yeah, well, if you know Shultz, you know he has no brains. 
 [Chuckles] So where you from, anyway, Shea? 
 Floral Park. 
 Where's that? 
 Long island. 
 No, it's actually Queens. It's on the borderline of Nassau. 
 Who cares? It might as well be in friggin' Ohio. 
 I heard you went to college, too? 
 Yeah, yeah, Villanova. 
 Nova. Smart boy, huh? 
 Not exactly. I was on a baseball scholarship. 
 Scholarship? So I don't understand. 
 How the hell did you end up becoming a cop? 
 Obviously he wasn't good enough for the big leagues, ain't that right, slugger? 
 It's a long story. 
 Ah, well, come on. We got all night, DiMaggio. 
 Maybe some other time, once we all get to know each other a little better. 
 
 
 
 [Car door closes] 
 [Door closes] 
 Was I right? Did he do it? 
 Get that stupid son of a bitch over here right now. 
 [Sighs] 
 [Glass clatters] 
 Dad, does anyone know for sure if God is real? 
 Oh, that's... 
 Yes, God is real. 
 Well, what about heaven? 
 Well, depends on what you believe. 
 There are some religions that believe that there is a heaven and there are some others that don't. 
 So... Heaven could not be real? 
 Heaven's real. Don't listen to your father. 
 So will uncle John go to heaven? 
 Will Uncle John go to heaven? That's a very good question. 
 If I was you guys, I would not take that bet. 
 [Laughs] 
 [Laughs] 
 James, why don't you say grace? 
 In the name of the father and the son and the holy ghost, bless us, o Lord, in these thy gifts which we are about to receive from thy bounty. 
 Through Christ our lord, amen. 
 Amen. 
 Amen. 
 [Telephone rings] 
 Go ahead and answer it. 
 [Ring] 
 Hello? 
 Yeah. Hey, Dad. No, we just sat down for dinner. 
 All right, after I put the kids to bed, I will see you then. 
 All right, yes, no. Of course they will be at the wake. 
 Goodbye. 
 I don't want them going to the wake or to the funeral. 
 What are you talkin' about? 
 You wanna explain that to my mother and my aunt Kay, be my guest. 
 You didn't even like him. 
 What does it matter? He's my uncle. 
 They have to go. End of story. 
 Can I talk to you for a minute? 
 [Silverware clinking] 
 [James and Michael speaking indistinctly] 
 They barely knew him. 
 And I heard from Mrs. Gilroy about James today. 
 Apparently, he was acting all proud that he was related to him, like your uncle's some kind of big shot. 
 Well, all the more reason that James should come. 
 He should see what happens to the big shots. 
 No, he doesn't need to see that. 
 I don't want him around those guys. 
 I don't want any of us around them. I'm tired of it. 
 It's exactly why I wanna get out of this neighborhood. 
 So you can turn this into a conversation about that? 
 You just told me you think he got shot right down the street. 
 For crying out loud, Terry, three blocks from here. 
 All right. All right. 
 The littles don't need to come, but James is going. 
 [Sighs] 
 Goddamn fool. 
 What you did was act like a brain-dead, self-destructive jackass who cares nothing for himself or his family or anyone around him. 
 Tell me, what line of work is the O'Bannon family in? 
 I didn't hear you. 
 They're pigs. 
 That's right. 
 They're New York City police officers. 
 Are you not satisfied with just going back to jail, hmm? 
 Is your ambition also to wind up in the chair? 
 There's nothing to worry about 'cause there's no witnesses. 
 I was smart about it. I waited outside till he left the joint. 
 Ha! You were smart about it. 
 With everybody in the goddamn place looking at the two of you arguing, hmm? 
 Oh, they wouldn't testify against you... till they drop a dime on you. 
 They probably already have. 
 We're not street thugs anymore, goddamn it! 
 We're businessmen. Loans. 
 Numbers. Gambling. Protection. The unions. 
 That's  what's important. 
 Mr. O. Jesus. 
 Mr. O. was a lowlife, wife-beating braggart who meant nothing to you or to me. 
 Guy talks sh1t to me, I take care of it. 
 He talked sh1t to you, did he? [Laughs] Jesus. 
 If I put a bullet in the head of every gobshite who talked sh1t to me, I'd have been fried 30 years ago, and I'd have deserved it for my stupidity. 
 Instead I live here in this nice house. 
 I take good care of my family. 
 I live very comfortably, and I hope to die that way, too. 
 That's exactly the sh1t he was talking about. 
 He was saying you were getting too comfortable, too soft, too old. 
 And why should any of that nonsense concern you? 
 I live better now because I choose to live better. 
 I want to live better. 
 I work my ass off so I can live better and  you  can live better. 
 My father and me worked hard for 40 years to build this goddamn business. 
 That's why we came here to this country, and now you may have smashed it to pieces with one brainless act. 
 It was time to send a message. 
 A message to whom? What was the message? 
 What you may have done is start a war with Mr. O.'s young punks. That's what you may have done. 
 And who's gonna clean it up with them? 
 Huh, who? Not you. Me. 
 You don't have to clean up sh1t. I'll take care of it. 
 And I'll help him out. 
 Yeah. 
 Me and Uncle Red got it. 
 Oh, so you're gonna take care of it. 
 Well, I feel so much better now. 
 All right. If it does go there, you take care of it, you understand? 
 You take care of it cleanly. 
 I don't want it coming back to me. 
 I don't want your problem to become  our  problem. 
 Do you understand? Get the hell outta here. 
 You make sure this happens properly. 
 Don't I always? 
 Get this. See? 
 [Laughs] 
 Huh? Look at that. 
 Chivalry isn't dead. 
 Oh, yeah, it's just dying a slow death. 
 Oh, come on. Hey, come here. 
 [Chuckles] [Horn honks in distance] 
 You're real pretty, you know that? 
 And you're a real drunk. 
 What, me? 
 Yeah, you. 
 No, no, I'm just... I'm feeling good. 
 Really? You don't feel the tiniest bit of sadness? 
 [Horn honks in distance] 
 If I said yes, would you kiss me? 
 Hey, O'Bannon. Heard what happened to your old man. 
 Don't listen to 'em. 
 Couldn't happen to a nicer guy. 
 Just let it go. Let it go. 
 [Door creaks] Sorry. I didn't catch that, asshole. 
 Uhh! 
 [Grunting] 
 [Thud] 
 [Grunting continues] 
 Deirdre : Sean! Watch out! Watch out! 
 Uhh! [Clatter] 
 Ohh! 
 All right, all right, enough! Sean, Sean, let's go! Let's go!

 Mac, get him a glass of milk. 
 Harry? 
 Two scotches, neat. 
 Look, I got that new kid I was telling you about, all right? 
 To plainclothes. [Clink] 
 The best gig there is. 
 That's what I hear from everybody. 
 [Lowered voice] Take a look around, joltin' Joe. 
 You're hanging out in a nightclub. 
 You're drinking for free. 
 And if you got half a game, you might even get laid. 
 And, oh, yeah, you're getting paid. 
 Barely. I'm taking home $85 a week. 
 That'll change. 
 I heard that from everybody, too, but when? 
 When we decide we can trust you. 
 And we're a long way from that. 
 Mac, you know Harry Hardware, right? 
 Harry. Good to see you. Pete. 
 This is the new kid I was telling you about... Shea. 
 How are you, sir? 
 "Sir"? "Sir." Yeah, he's real formal, this one. 
 He's like a choirboy, right? 
 No need for that. You call me "Harry," all right? 
 Oh, I'm sorry. I heard you were on the job. 
 Come on. That was ancient history. 
 But, look, you have fun. Anything you want, okay? 
 Thank you. 
 Good. Have fun. 
 That guy Harry? 
 Legend when he was on the job. 
 I'll have to ask my pops about him. 
 [Glass clatters] 
 Hello. 
 Well, we're in here. 
 Hey, Mom. Dad. Kay. 
 Himself finally shows up. 
 I'm so sorry. 
 Thanks for comin', Terrance. 
 Yeah, of course. 
 You're a good one. Always were. 
 Regardless of what your father has to say about you. 
 [Clears throat] Yeah, well, all the credit goes to your sister. Isn't that right, Mom? 
 Hmm. 
 I'm only her half-sister, as she's constantly reminding everyone. 
 Only because it's true. My mother was a saint, unlike the whore that birthed you... 
 Oh, come on. 
 Can we not get started on that again? 
 And broke up my family. 
 Ina, the woman has suffered enough already. 
 Don't listen to her, Kay. She's been drinking since 10:00 this morning. 
 Yeah, I got a late start. 
 When you get yourself a beer, get me a scotch. 
 Ina, you've had enough. Ina... 
 I'll tell you when I've had enough. 
 I will tell  you. 
 Kay, if there is anything you need at all, just remember, Christine and I are just a few blocks away. 
 We can be over here like that. 
 There is something you can promise me, Terrance. 
 Yeah. Whatever you need. 
 Promise me you'll find who did this to John. 
 Well, I, uh, you know, the lead detective on the case is a good friend. 
 No, I don't wanna hear about the lead detective. 
 You tell me that  you'll  do it. 
 Tell me you'll find the son of a bitch that killed John. Can you promise me that? 
 He absolutely will, Kay, and you got my word as well. 
 We will get these guys. 
 We are not about to let somebody think that they can screw with the Muldoon family and get away with it? Isn't that right, Terrance? 
 Well, whatever you say, sarge. Yep. 
 Absolutely, Kay. 
 [Mouths words] 
 I'm gonna get you that drink, Mom. 
 Thank you. 
 We'll take care of this.

 This guy can put 'em back like a real irishman. 
 Yeah, well, are you two Irish assholes gonna stand here all night and jerk each other off? 
 Or are you gonna go play some cards? [Glass clatters] 
 You know me, Bull. I'm always feeling lucky. 
 Yeah? What about you, slugger? 
 You as good at cards as you are at baseball? 
 I don't really gamble, sir. 
 Oh, well, you will tonight. 
 Go ahead. 
 Hey. Can I get a bourbon and coke, please? 
 That was crazy, what you did back there. 
 What got into you?

 No, no, it's not like that. It's... it's about... 
 Look, I can call him an asshole, all right?

 Hey, Mickey Mantle, lighten up. 
 It's supposed to be fun when you're ahead. 
 Let's go again. 
 So you're convinced it's not your cousin Sean. 
 Yeah, Dad. 
 Because it's one thing to wanna kill your father. 
 It's another thing to actually do it. 
 [Chuckles] 
 Don't give me your sob story. 
 I was never all that hard on you. 
 Every beatin' you ever got you deserved. 
 Oh, yeah? What about after I blew that free throw against Bishop Loughlin my senior year of high school? 
 Especially then. You cost us the game, not to mention a few hundred that I had on it, too. 
 You're a lunatic. 
 [Chuckles] 
 You know, I wasn't just giving your aunt a line of sh1t in there, you know. 
 We need to find the prick that killed your uncle. 
 I wanna know who's responsible. 
 I wanna know who's responsible, who called the shot, who did the shooting, if, in fact, they are not one and the same. 
 We can't let some scumbag think he can get away with this. 
 John may have been a world-class asshole. 
 Yes, he was. 
 He's still family. 
 Not by blood, he's not. 
 Family's family. We need to even the score. 
 Bullshit, dad. 
 This needs to be solved. 
 Then let Battalina do his job. I don't need to get involved. 
 Terry, I'm not asking ya. I'm telling ya. 
 You're gonna find these guys. 
 You're gonna find 'em and you're gonna take care of it. 
 And if you don't, I will. 
 [Horn honks, engine rumbling in distance] 
 That's bullshit the way the old man talks to me. 
 It's bullshit. 
 If I wasn't his son, he wouldn't pull that kind of sh1t. 
 Hey, I'm his brother. I've been on the receiving end of that bullshit even longer than you. 
 But he's the boss, Rusty. That's all there is to it. 
 It still ain't right. I do him a favor by whacking Mr. O., and does he thank me? 
 No. He just ends up breaking my balls. 
 Jesus Christ. 
 Grow some goddamn stones, would you? 
 You found like a freaking schoolgirl. 
 What you did was overboard, Rusty. 
 And if we're not careful, it's gonna end up biting us in the ass. 
 Says you. 
 If I was running things, it'd be a little bit different. 
 Yeah, but you're not running things. Not yet. 
 You might one day, but not yet, and don't ever talk like that again. 
 You just gotta be patient, Rusty. 
 Your father's an old man. 
 He's not gonna be the boss forever. 
 When he's done, when he steps down, then it's your time. 
 Seven years in that shithole... did that son of a bitch visit me once? 
 I'm not sure how much longer I'm willing to wait. 
 I'm begging you, Rusty, don't start thinking like this. 
 Your father might be old, but he ain't dead yet. 
 [Door opens in distance] 
 Now here he comes. Get down. 
 Hey, Karl, how you doing? Come on. Sit in. 
 I need to talk to you. 
 How you doin'? 
 I'm... 
 Tell me about the other night. 
 Please, let Mr. Patton know that I-I didn't tell the cops nothin' 
 'cause I didn't see nothin'. 
 Nothin'? At all? 
 No, no, not a thing. 
 Okay, good. But you were there when Mr. O. and Rusty had words, right? 
 Like I said, I didn't see nothin'. 
 I mean, if they had words, I must have been in the back when that whole thing happened, but the, uh, uh, actually, you know, uh, Rusty wasn't even in the bar that night. 
 Yeah, there you go. That's better. [Pats leg] 
 Was there anyone else who was in the bar that night who, uh, might have a big mouth? 
 There was a couple of hookers in there with Mr. O. 
 Mm-hmm. 
 And one of 'em, I'd never seen before. 
 Really good-lookin' broad. 
 Right. 
 The other was that nutty kid, Suzie. 
 Oh, yeah. 
 Now him and the girls got into some kind of beef. 
 And, you know, they left a good 20 minutes before him, so I-I don't think that... 
 But the girls... they were in there when, uh, the whole beef happened with Rusty? 
 Oh, they... they saw the whole thing go down. 
 Yeah, well, you see, I thought you just told me Rusty wasn't in the bar that night. 
 Oh, Tommy, th-th-that's what I meant. 
 I was just... 
 You gotta keep the story straight, Karl. 
 I-I-I'm the guy who made the call for you. 
 I-I'm in this up to my neck, too. 
 Aah! [Strained voice] Let me go! 
 [Choking] [Grunting] 
 [Choking] Please! Please! 
 Just die already, you son of a bitch. 
 Come on, Rusty. Put some muscle into it. Put some effort into it, huh? 
 [Grunting] 
 There you go. All right. 
 I'll get rid of this fat b*st*rd. 
 You take care of Suzie. 
 [Car door opens] [Grunts] 
 [Car door closes] 
 [Engine starts] 
 [Engine revs, tires squeal] 
 Mully! 
 What do you say, Bull? 
 How you feelin'? 
 Good, good. 
 So how's our man Shea doing? 
 I don't like him. 
 I don't like his face. 
 Yeah, you never like the new guys. 
 What do you think? Is he gonna be okay? 
 If it's okay to be a jerkoff. 
 [Chuckles] You're a lot of help, you know that? 
 Yeah, what do you want from me? 
 Look, if I'm done babysitting this kid, I'm gonna call it a night, all right? 
 Yeah, all right. Get outta here. 
 All right, I'll talk to you tomorrow. 
 Mac, I'll see you later, all right? 
 Yeah, Bull. See you. 
 Charlie. 
 I'll see you later, Harry. 
 Terrance. 
 Harry, what do you say? 
 How you doing? 
 Good, good. 
 Hey, gorgeous, gorgeous. Get this man our best scotch. 
 I'm sorry to hear about your uncle. 
 [Lowered voice] What are you gonna do? You know what a pain in the ass he was when he was alive, right? So... 
 [Lowered voice] Tell me about it. 
 So what are you hearing? 
 You know, I got a homicide in Hell's Kitchen. What do you think I'm hearing? 
 Nothing. 
 Well, if I hear anything on this end, I'll be sure to let you know. 
 All right, I appreciate that. 
 And by the way, I met the new kid, Shea. 
 He, uh, he seems all right. 
 Yeah, he looks like he's having a good time, too. 
 Who's the girl? 
 That's one of mine. Told her to show him a good time. 
 [Both chuckle] 
 Hey, you got a problem with me buying this kid a hat? 
 No, no, just hit him once, though. 
 I don't want him getting too greedy, you know? 
 Uh-huh. All right. 
 Pardon me, young Shea, but, uh, really nice meeting you. 
 I want you to come here whenever you want, okay? 
 Okay.

 Hey, Terry. 
 Jonesy. 
 You ask, and you shall receive. 
 Our witness. 
 Yeah, if she's the same girl, which I do believe she is. 
 Now get this. She goes by the name of Suzie Smith, Salley Lopez... [Chuckles] Sammy Greenberg, and, oh, yeah, yeah, Janet Murphy. 
 Clearly, this girl's spent a lot of time outside the U.N., I guess. 
 [Laughs] Yeah, yeah. 
 Now most of those addresses are bullshit anyway except that one on East 38th street. 
 She did use it a few times. 
 I'm just hoping that maybe she got a little lazy and used her real address there. 
 You're not gonna believe this. 
 What? 
 I collared this broad outside the Plaza a couple of years ago when I was with the pussy posse. 
 She was obviously working in a nice part of town back then. 
 Come on, come on, come on. You actually remember her? 
 Do you really think I remember some whore I locked up a couple of years ago? Come on, Tony. 
 See, Muldoon? That's why you're never gonna get the gold shield. Me... I'm good with faces. 
 That's what makes me a great detective. 
 Oh, I know, I know. You're such a great detective that you got stuck working this horseshit case, right? 
 You know what? Screw you, you Irish prick. 
 Oh, my apologies, Sherlock. 
 What do you say we kill these beers? 
 I'll ride over there with you, and maybe the super sleuth can show me how he works his magic? 
 Sure. Salut, Watson. [Clink]

 Ah. Hi, Rusty. 
 Hey. What's with the suitcase? You going somewhere? 
 Uh, yeah. I-I was just gonna take the train to the Port Authority.

 Come on. Jump in. I'll give you a lift instead. 
 No, that's all right. I'll just take the train. 
 Come on. You shouldn't be down there at this hour. 
 There's a lot of creeps on the subway this time of night. 
 Come on. 
 Just so you know, I'm not gonna tell nobody nothin'. 
 And that's why I'm leaving town.
