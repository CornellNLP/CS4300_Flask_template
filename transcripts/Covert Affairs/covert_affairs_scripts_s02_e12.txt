 This started as an anonymous tip, but it's turned out to be a crash course in money laundering. 
 All right. What's the front company? 
 Honey factory in South Africa. 
 Let me guess, honey's real, some of the orders are fake. 
 Bing! 
 Invoices show the factory sold an order to a confectionary at 134 Rue du Lombard in Brussels. 
 Except it doesn't exist. 
 Trip to Brussels isn't a bad deal. 
 Yeah, but honey money moves fast. 
 Next to an off-shore account in Bermuda, then to Berlin, to a private investment company owned by-drumroll, please- 
 Isaak Von Hagen. 
 Isaak Von Hagen, go-to guy for tax evaders the world over. 
 Yeah, now he's rumored to be moving money for terrorists. 
 So how do we get to a guy with that many layers? 
 We don't. We get to his wife. 
 You think she's the way in? 
 Elsa Von Hagen just opened a private bank account a few weeks ago under a false name, her first in 20 years of marriage. 
 You think she's looking for a change? 
 Right now, she's looking for a hat. 
 Shopping's over. I'll check in later. 
 Listen closely. 
 You're to tell Arthur Campbell I've requested to see him. 
 I don't know who- 
 Don't turn around. 
 The way you follow me like a lovesick puppy. 
 Either you fancy me, or you're C.I.A. seeking intel on my husband's clients. 
 Or maybe it's both. 
 I want a meeting with Arthur Campbell. Make it so. 
 Guess I won't bother asking you if you're actually going to Berlin. 
 Is this woman Elsa Von Hagen who I think she is? 
 A former asset. Yeah, she went by the name Petra then, but it's her. 
 You said she was trouble. 
 Unreliable maybe. 
 Dangerous is the word you used. 
 Why was she so dangerous? 
 Oh, it was Berlin in '89. 
 It's a different time. 
 Have you looped in German intelligence? 
 No. Isaak Von Hagen has moles all over the BND. 
 Arthur, you're a public figure. 
 You can't go skulking around Berlin and expect the BND not to notice. 
 It's not about not being noticed. 
 It's about not being caught. 
 Karl Schmidt's one of the good guys. He'll want to help. 
 Isaak is ultimately his problem anyway. 
 Karl could be the mole. 
 Well, have you at least given thought as to who'll cover your desk? 
 Yes. You. Give you a chance to see the job you passed up. 
 You looking for this? 
 Yes. 
 Promise me you'll meet with Elsa and come right back. 
 You'll barely have time to miss me. 
 Arthur has agreed to meet Elsa. 
 He's en route to Berlin now. 
 How do I contact him? 
 Being spotted with Arthur, an overt C.I.A. officer, could blow your cover. 
 So I suggest you follow strict protocols. 
 Limit face-to-face meetings, use secure phone lines. 
 Standard handler protocol. 
 As far as your asset, Elsa Von Hagen, is concerned, she's not to be trusted. 
 I never expected Arthur actually to come to Berlin. 
 I didn't realize you had expectations for your missions. 
 Sorry. 
 I mean, how does a woman like Elsa even know Arthur? 
 Elsa is actually a long term asset of Arthur's named Petra Mueller. 
 Former STASI. 
 That's how she made me. 
 They were some of the best. 
 Annie, I want you to run point on this. 
 You'll arrange the meet, liaise with Elsa- 
 Arthur's going to be in and out. 
 Think of him as an access agent, there only to make introductions. 
 And, Annie, I want a full report. 
 Of the meet? 
 Of everything. 
 I may be way off base on this, but I think Joan wants me to spy on Arthur. 
 What kind of intel is she looking for? 
 I don't know, but Arthur has way more experience as an operative, he already knows Elsa. 
 So why am I the one running point on this? 
 Well, it could be because you got us onto Isaak. 
 Could be because you're covert and he isn't. 
 I don't think so. 
 I think it has something to do with this woman Elsa. 
 I could hear it in Joan's voice. 
 Well, then this may be your most sensitive operation yet. 
 Great. 
 Thanks for that this was an NSA listening post. 
 Amazing what lengths our paranoia took us. 
 Speaking of which, are you sure you weren't followed? 
 Positive. I took three trams, doubled back, I used evasive tactics the whole way. 
 Good. I assume Joan's filled you in? 
 Yeah. Elsa will meet you tomorrow at Britz-Ost harbor. 
 No. 
 I can- 
 You'll let me handle Elsa. 
 You can let her think we're meeting at the harbor, but I've got another location in mind. 
 Another location? 
 I want to control the meet. 
 Gartendfelder Strasse. 
 What's the issue? 
 I-it's an office park now. 
 Oh. How about Bernauer? 
 Or is that a T.G.I.Friday's? 
 No. Bernauer is good. 
 "Turn and face the strange." 
 Brecht? 
 Bowie. 
 He recorded three albums here in Berlin. 
 You'll need this for the meet. 
 I thought I was going to take a more active role. 
 I mean, Joan gave me that impression, but it's fine. 
 Elsa's my problem. 
 All you have to do is follow my lead. 
 Understood. 
 Same evasive tactics on the way home. 
 Don't worry about Joan. 
 If all goes to hell, it's on me. 
 Oh, I'm sorry. 
 Arthur and I had a meeting scheduled. 
 Numbers meeting. 
 Yes, I'm aware. 
 I can come back. 
 No, it's okay. 
 Arthur read me in. 
 I-it's not that pressing. 
 Really. I'll just... stop in tomorrow. 
 Joan. 
 Came to pick up the files on the Santorini operation. 
 I'm reassigned to special projects. 
 I'm sure you've heard about it, the new division I'm heading up. 
 Yes, congratulations. 
 Richly deserved. 
 Thank you. Now the files. 
 May you be more prudent with your own budget than you were with mine. 
 If you need help while Arthur's away, I'll be in my office. 
 Apparently Arthur didn't get the message. 
 His orders are the exact opposite of Joan's. 
 That sounds pretty interesting. 
 You know what? Maybe I should stick around, huh? 
 Where would you be going? 
 Richmond. 
 It's Billy's 30th birthday. 
 Or it would have been. 
 Billy from Special Ops? 
 The Jack of Diamonds mission? 
 Yeah. 
 His family's holding a special memorial, but... 
 These things can be difficult, you know? 
 The other families are there... 
 Billy meant a lot to you. 
 His friends and family are celebrating his life, and you... you were a part of that. 
 Auggie? 
 Yeah. 
 Go. 
 Guten Tag. 
 You must be excited to see Arthur. 
 Or do you always drive this fast? 
 Is that what's making you nervous, my fast driving? 
 Or is it something else? 
 Just like to get where I'm going all in one piece, that's all. 
 Arthur. 
 You wanted a meet? 
 You got it. 
 Not even a hello? 
 Hello, Elsa. 
 You've hardly changed. 
 Your little stunt could've gotten us killed. 
 I happen to know you can handle yourself behind the wheel. 
 Annie said you're offering us Isaak's client information. 
 All I want in return is resettlement in the U.K. 
 Why so eager to cooperate? 
 Isaak changed. 
 His business used to be a few bean counters looking to cheat on their taxes. 
 His new clients, they are killers. 
 How do we get this client list? 
 There's only one way to get that information. 
 Become a client. 
 Twice we sent operatives to become clients. 
 They got nowhere. 
 Well, your operatives didn't have me to vouch for them. 
 So you're the key to this whole thing. 
 Who do you think gave you the tip about AJ Manufacturing? 
 Face it, Arthur. 
 You need me. 
 Then pitch me to Isaak. 
 My husband is no fool. 
 He knows you're C.I.A. 
 He knows your past. 
 Unless you've been misleading him all this time. 
 Tell him I sold you secrets in '89. 
 He could be convinced I've been selling secrets all along. 
 I'm sure he's heard about my legal troubles at the agency. 
 A man in my position might need some place to stash the money. 
 Well, if he suspects anything, he'll kill us both. 
 Then you'd better be convincing. 
 I look forward to meeting your husband. 
 Does Langley know about this plan? 
 You mean Joan. 
 Joan appreciates resourcefulness. 
 All that matters is whether or not the job gets done. 
 And it will. 
 The meeting must happen today. 
 Today? 
 In a couple of hours. 
 Tell Arthur he can't accept the terms Isaak will give him. 
 Isaak will know it's a set-up. 
 I'll tell him. 
 Arthur is crazy to be doing this. You must know that. 
 He's good at what he does. 
 Arthur was going to rise quickly in the C.I.A. 
 Berlin proved it. 
 I set him on that path. 
 Maybe he's trying to get us all killed. 
 Or maybe it's only me. 
 Why would he want that? 
 You give Arthur the message. 
 He must be prompt. 
 Good luck to us all. 
 The venue's a bit atypical, I know. 
 But we've got Billy's high school football team competing for the state championship on the big screens, 30 beers on tap. 
 A party tailor-made for Billy. 
 You're one of Billy's college buddies, right? 
 The cop, right? 
 Firearms training would be tricky. 
 Oh. You're Auggie. 
 I'm sorry, I can't believe I didn't put that together. 
 I'm Parker. 
 Billy's little sister. 
 Yeah. 
 It's nice of you to come. 
 The whole family's been wondering how you're getting along. 
 How are you getting along, Auggie? 
 Hey, you're skyping me, you must miss me. 
 Yeah. I'd also love for you to yell if you see Chloe's paintings anywhere in this pile. 
 The ones she did for the art show? 
 Yeah. I thought I put them away for safe-keeping a few weeks ago, but... 
 Oh, no. 
 What? 
 I got them framed. 
 Oh, how sweet. 
 Yeah, but they're in my apartment. 
 Well, I'll go get them. 
 You can't. 
 No one can know where it is. 
 I can't know where you live? 
 Not this particular apartment. The agency has strict protocols. 
 The school art show is tonight. 
 Chloe's going to be crushed if her work isn't part of the exhibit. 
 I know. 
 So have someone go get them. 
 Danielle, no one at the agency can know where I live. 
 Okay, what am I supposed to tell Chloe? 
 How do I explain this? 
 I'm sorry. 
 You know what? Just save your apologies. 
 Danielle. 
 Guten Tag, Mr. Campbell. 
 Please have a seat. 
 I must say, rarely does a C.I.A. man come to me for help. 
 Well, there comes a time when a man must prepare an exit strategy. 
 For me that time appears to be now. 
 Only a man with special talent can keep his true nature hidden. 
 If what my wife says is true, you have kept yours hidden a long time. 
 I'll take that as a compliment. 
 You may be using that special talent on me right now. 
 Perhaps the C.I.A. made a deal with the Polizei. 
 If so, the C.I.A. would not choose to send me. 
 Because you're overt? 
 Because the C.I.A. doesn't trust me anymore. 
 You worked with my wife during the '80s, no? 
 I was posing as a student. We had a class together. 
 I'm sure you were quite taken with him, weren't you, Elsa? 
 Wie so, of course. 
 I thought it was true love. 
 The pull of young love is powerful. 
 One might suspect now the two of you are plotting against me. 
 Well, I assure you. 
 I prefer my wife to answer. 
 I'd be twice a fool, then. 
 He's here because he is in a bind. 
 And I am fortunate to have a husband who can help him. 
 And you think you can trust me? 
 I do. 
 Words are cheap, actions are what count. 
 C.I.A. teaches you this? 
 My wife. 
 Three million dollars, that's the minimum deposit. 
 I take 4%. 
 Hefty minimum. 
 For you, yes. 
 But I'm sure you amassed a small fortune selling secrets, didn't you? 
 But I'm not the kind of guy who puts all of his eggs in one basket. 
 Three million. 
 It's all the eggs I've got. 
 You say I'm a man you can trust, so trust. 
 You have until 3 P.M. tomorrow. 
 Uh, koennen Sie mir sagen... 
 Um.. 
 Let me help. 
 Ah! Do you speak English? 
 Yeah. 
 Great. 
 I'm trying to find this concert hall. 
 Oh. You don't want to go there. 
 I know a place, it's more exclusive, but the admission prices are a little steep. 
 Uh... How steep? 
 About three million, and I need it by tomorrow. 
 Make eye-contact with that woman in front of you. 
 No, the one over my right shoulder. 
 Convey annoyance with me. 
 If she responds, she's not a shadow. 
 Okay. Great! 
 Can you just point me in the right direction? 
 Well, it's old-school, but it works. 
 So what do you want to do now? 
 I'm going to ask Joan to divert money from another mission. 
 Okay. Maybe- Maybe I should be the one to call Joan. 
 We have a better shot if I do it. 
 Yeah, but you're supposed to be on a plane home already, and I've only blown one check-in. 
 Well, maybe you're right. 
 Okay. Um, then, I'm going to need to be read in. 
 You've already been read in. 
 Not on you and Elsa. 
 Well, as you know, the officer-asset relationship can get complicated. 
 Assets stop being sources of intel, lines blur. 
 The lines blurred between you and Elsa? 
 You feel the need to be honest with Joan. That's admirable. 
 But I'm her husband, and I will explain it all later. 
 It's better that way. 
 Thanks! 
 In the end, I just did what most of us do. 
 I graduated, came home to Richmond, got a decent job. 
 I need to be close to family after what happened. 
 I'm sure they need you too. 
 I'm leaving the nest this fall, though. 
 Off to the Peace Corps. 
 Where are you being placed? 
 Not sure yet. But... 
 I always wanted to go, though, so... 
 It's about time I did, you know? 
 Yeah. 
 I forgot to ask what you brought for the scrapbook. 
 Actually, I'm empty-handed. 
 I wasn't sure I was coming to this. 
 Well, you can still contribute something. 
 It probably won't be as cool as the original sheet music to Billy's favorite song that I found, but you can try. 
 Not a world apart? 
 Yeah, that's the one. 
 Is it signed? 
 It was tough to find already, come on. 
 I think I can top it. 
 We're not an ATM, I can't get three million cleared that fast. 
 Arthur mentioned the possibility of diverting the money from another op. 
 The Santorini operation. 
 Well, Jal is in charge of that now, and I can't touch any of that money without his expressed approval. 
 Oh. 
 And I thought Arthur is supposed to be on a plane to Dulles right now. 
 If we can get the money into an account, we can get the bank codes, and then both of us can be home soon after that. 
 Annie, two other operatives have tried to become clients before. 
 What makes you certain this will work for you? 
 Annie? 
 Elsa's the key. 
 All right. 
 I'll speak to Jal. But this better work. 
 I never expected the guy that composed a world apart to look so professorial. 
 On this, I have no comment. 
 So you're really going to ask him to autograph the sheet music? 
 Well, we're here. 
 I'll get you a copy of his latest recording too. 
 You can take it with you this fall. 
 It's better if you don't. 
 I got good at using what happened as an excuse not to get on with things. 
 I don't want to fall back into old habits, you know? 
 Come on. 
 
 
 
 What are you doing? 
 We've got time. 
 Can't get an autograph till the end of the set, right? 
 You don't want to take a blind man to the dance floor. 
 You love the music. 
 So show it. 
 Jazz is about listening. 
 Wrong. Jazz is about feeling. 
 You know, you're doing pretty good. 
 You should see my electric slide. 
 Ms. Walker. Good morning. 
 Arthur was in love with her. 
 Elsa? Did you tell Joan? 
 No. We need her to make the money transfer. 
 I was afraid that if I told her about Arthur and Elsa, she wouldn't do it. 
 Why are you still up? 
 It's a school night. 
 I closed down the jazz club. 
 The guitarist was amazing. 
 Uh-huh. So who is she? 
 The guitarist? 
 Guy named Blackhorn. 
 You know what I mean. 
 Your date. 
 Oh, well, to quote the famous Annie Walker, that information is need to know. 
 Hey, it's me. 
 Hey. Annie said you came through with the money. 
 But you're the client, right? 
 How'd you know? 
 Arthur, I'm your wife. 
 And I'm a spy. 
 And given the fact that I had to horse-trade with Jal for the money, how 'bout you tell me the truth about you and Elsa? 
 Oh, I was green. 
 You were in love with her. 
 Well, I wasn't ready to admit it to anyone. Not even myself. 
 So two days ago when she called, you came running? 
 I know how it must look. 
 But there is nothing going on with me and Elsa. Please know that. 
 You know what's in two days from now? 
 Our wedding anniversary. 
 I'll be home by then. 
 You know, we haven't been in the same city on our anniversary in three years. 
 Last year, I was in Prague. 
 Well, this year, we'll start a new trend. 
 Where do you want to go? 
 I don't want to go anywhere. I just want to be home. 
 With you. 
 Good night, Arthur. 
 Oh, good night, Joan. 
 What the hell are you doing? 
 You know you can't be here. 
 Isaak is on to you. To us. I overheard him talking on the phone. 
 Somebody tipped him off. 
 Don't play games with me, Elsa. 
 Arthur, this is not a game. Either we go now, or we hide out somewhere till dark. 
 Like we did in 1989? 
 Our place is still there. You got the money, didn't you? 
 That's what this is all about. 
 The money. 
 You used to trust me. 
 Well, I chalk that up to immaturity. 
 You were mature enough t make me envision a life beyond the wall, a life with you. 
 You never intended to go anywhere. 
 As operatives go, you had great instincts. 
 Probably the best of any operative I'd seen. 
 You really think you could've been so wrong about me? 
 Hello? 
 Elsa showed up t the hotel room claiming the operation's been compromised, that isaak is on to us. 
 You don't believe her? 
 She's trying to play us. 
 So what do you want to do? 
 Meet me at the usual spot in ten minutes. 
 I'll try and figure something out. 
 Coming with me. 
 What's going on? 
 Annie, meet Karl schmidt, my German counterpart at the BND. 
 Fahren Sie. 
 Karl and I have spoken many times on the phone, but never in person until now. 
 He's been shadowing us. 
 Saw him at he curry wurst stand. 
 Did Elsa Von Hagen order you to pick us up? 
 I don't take orders from the Von Hagens, Arthur. 
 I'm one of the good guys, remember? 
 Well, it's hard to tell, the way you snatched us up. 
 I think you'd be more appreciative. 
 I'm getting you out of Berlin, keeping you alive. 
 Oh. Is that what you're doing? 
 Been surveilling the Von Hagens long before you got here. 
 This morning, we hear chatter that Isaak wants you dead. 
 He would take great pleasure in taking you down, smearing your reputation, and that of the C.I.A. in the process. 
 Your plane to D.C. 
 The local Polizei will ensure that you are on it when it departs. 
 Verstanden? 
 Ja, sofort. 
 Safe travels to you both, then. 
 Oh, and, uh... 
 Nice jacket. 
 Very German. 
 Arthur. What about Elsa? 
 What about her? 
 We're just going to leave her here? 
 You heard what Karl said, she vouched for us. 
 There's a lot about Elsa you don't know. 
 Okay. 
 Read me in. 
 She was playing a game back in '89. 
 One I barely got out of. 
 We were supposed to meet at one of the train stations that the secret police had closed down after the Berlin wall was built. 
 Ghost station. 
 She was going to defect. 
 I get there. 
 Elsa's nowhere to be found. 
 But the STASIi's there, with guns. 
 I know you're my boss. You're actually my boss's boss, which is worse. 
 But if you thought Elsa betrayed you, why'd you come to Berlin? 
 Why'd you take that call? 
 If you're absolutely certain she betrayed you, then we should get on that plane right now, but... 
 If there's any doubt-- 
 I do have doubts. 
 But it's too late. 
 No, if there's a chance to save her, we should take it. 
 I know how difficult it can be. 
 Trusting someone when it seems dangerous. 
 We'd have to get by these guys first. 
 Yeah. 
 How? 
 I got 13 operatives out of here during the cold war, I can get us back in now. 
 How did you know the Polizei would help us? 
 Well, the Polizei hate the way the BND come in barking orders. 
 Kind of like the police and f.B.I. 
 Some things are universal. 
 A man in uniform's distaste for a suit, that's one. 
 The ghost station's down here. 
 Wait here. 
 It could be dangerous. 
 It's okay. I'll come. 
 Stay here. Keep your eyes open. 
 Arthur? 
 You must go. Now. 
 Isaak, he knows I was working with you. 
 I think one of his men followed me here. 
 I did my best to shake him, but I can't be sure. 
 We've got a van outside. 
 We move quickly, we got a shot at escaping. 
 Arthur, thank you. 
 You don't have to thank me. Let's go. 
 He's still not back, Miles. 
 Sorry. 
 Let me save you another trip. 
 Arthur will trade you Deshawn Jackson for Eli Manning and your first pick in the keeper draft. 
 What? 
 That's breakaway speed, and I'm sure Manning isn't thrilled to be warming your bench. 
 Yeah. 
 Auggie. Have you heard from Arthur or Annie? 
 No, why? 
 Because they still haven't picked up the money, and neither of them are answering their phones. 
 I'll see what I can find out. 
 That's him. One of Isaak's men. 
 This way. My car's hidden not far from here. 
 Come on. 
 Halt! 
 Go, go. 
 Down! 
 Oh, we Americans have a few moves of our own. 
 Don't worry, I got this. 
 Your flight to London. 
 Interpol has Isaak in custody already, so you'll be safe. 
 Your mission succeeded. 
 They have a team pulling valuable intel from Isaak's network as we speak. 
 Funny... 
 I thought the only way I'd ever leave Berlin was with you. 
 I was detained that last night. 
 Somebody had tipped the police off about us, about what we were planning. 
 I told no one. 
 You believe me now, don't you? 
 It doesn't matter. You'll go to England, I'll go home to D.C. 
 To your wife. 
 Good-bye, Arthur. 
 Good-bye, Elsa. 
 It's not the ending of the cold war, but it's a job well done. 
 Oh... I got a hero's welcome when the wall fell. 
 One that I did not deserve. 
 I just happened to be in Berlin at the right time. 
 The kudos you'll receive for this work you've done here will be well earned. 
 I can hardly take the credit. 
 Oh, you'll have to. 
 I was never here. 
 Hey. 
 I'm sorry to show up like this. 
 No, it's okay. 
 Is everything all right? 
 Come on in. 
 Um, it would have made more sense to call, but I thought I should say this in person. 
 And I need to say it now or I might lose my nerve. 
 Okay. 
 I really appreciate your offering to hang out this weekend, but I don't know. 
 You don't think it's such a good idea. 
 Yeah. I mean, it just took so long to get over losing Billy, and this feels like- 
 No, no. You know what... 
 Hey, you don't need to explain it. Certainly not to me. 
 Okay. 
 Well, I... 
 Guess I should go then. 
 I'm sorry. I shouldn't have done that. 
 I thought we were on the same page. 
 You said this was a bad idea. 
 Mm-hmm. Right. 
 So we agree. 
 Mm-hmm. 
 No romantic dinner. 
 I assumed I'd be eating alone. 
 I'm sorry. 
 You had me worried. 
 You didn't need to be. 
 You should have told me. 
 You're right. 
 But Berlin is behind me. 
 For us Navy boys... 
 This symbolizes safe passage home. 
 It's beautiful. 
 I got you something too. 
 Eli Manning? 
 Mm-hmm. 
 Thanks to me, you're winning now. 
 Happy anniversary. 
 Happy anniversary. 
 Danielle? 
 Chocolate chip pancakes. Chloe's favorite. 
 I made them myself. 
 Well, the girls aren't up yet. 
 I know this won't make up for what happened with Chloe's artwork. 
 I realize we don't always get the chance to make things right. 
 Sometimes what's done is done. 
 I just hope this isn't one of those times. 
 Have you slept? 
 Not yet. 
 I- I got in late last night. 
 Well, the girls will be up any minute. 
 They can't eat all these pancakes by themselves. 
 What do you think? 
 Let's see. 
 Oh, my God. 
 Good, right? 
 They're amazing.
