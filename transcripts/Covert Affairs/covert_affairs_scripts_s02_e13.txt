 Previously on  Covert Affairs... 
 You're one of Billy's college buddies, right? 
 I'm Parker. 
 Billy's little sister. 
 I'm leaving the next this fall though. 
 Off to the Peace Corps. 
 You don't wanna take a blind man to the dance floor. 
 It just took so long to get over losing Billy, and this feels like-- 
 No, no, you don't need to explain it. 
 I'm sorry, I shouldn't have done that. 
 That's how they teach you in the CIA? 
 Why would CIA and Mossad share the same safe house? 
 Food. You don't want it to get cold. 
 So many have trouble improvising, but you, you have some gears to shift into. 
 Listen, buddy, if you-- 
 bonsoir. 
 This is-- 
 A pleasant surprise, I hope. 
 [Grunts] 
 Let's go. 
 Maybe the Riviera next time. 
 I don't know. 
 The beaches in Israel are much better. 
 [Indistinct chatter] 
 [Cell phone rings] 
 I can't talk. 
 This is Vincent Rossabi, your friendly neighborhood "G" man. 
 Uh, this is not a good time. 
 Well, can you give the FBI five minutes? 
 Blues yard, you know it? 
 Yeah, I know it. I'll be there in 15. 
 Okay. 
 I am so sorry. It's work. 
 I mean, can I give you a ride somewhere? 
 No, they're sending a car. 
 So rude. Can we reschedule? 
 It's okay. 
 I, uh, I know a ripcord call when I hear one. 
 It really is work. 
 It's okay. 
 Bluegrass? but I need a favor. 
 I think we've run that joke into the ground, don't you? 
 Okay. 
 I've got a confidential informant who has been approached by a CIA operative. 
 Approached? 
 Harassed, spooked, you fill in the blank. 
 And this informant figures importantly in a case that we have spent, well, that I have spent a great deal of time on. 
 You want the Agency to back off? 
 Affirmative. 
 Okay. 
 Did you run it up the chain? 
 Yeah, I crossed my Ts, dotted my Is. 
 I mean, it was protocol all the way. 
 And? 
 Global deafening silence. 
 I'm not sure what you think-- 
 Okay, you know what, you can take a message for me. 
 You can tell your operative he can forget about tonight. 
 I don't even know if we have an op, and I certainly don't know anything about tonight. 
 Yeah, well, he was supposed to meet my asset at Joe's Bar. 
 He will not be there. 
 Nothing? 
 I'm telling you, there is no Agency interest in Rossabi's informant. 
 And you know how I love coming in late at night to find nothing. 
 Oh, don't sell yourself short, Auggie. 
 Nobody finds nothing like you. 
 Guess I walked into that one. 
 Dealer's choice, I'd say. 
 Your call, Walker. 
 Uh, I'm going in. 
 Why am I not surprised? 
 How are you gonna know this impostor? 
 Rossabi said he'll be at the last table on the right. 
 Happy hunting. Call me after. 
 Annie Walker. 
 Eyal Lavin. 
 You know, people have gone to prison for impersonating a CIA operative. 
 Well, then I sure hope I don't get caught.

 [Laughing] 
 All right. 
 Your back's gonna be to the door. 
 What's Mossad doing? 
 Mossad? 
 I don't know. 
 Me, I'm just having a drink. 
 Will you join me? 
 You know what I mean. 
 Having a Sazerac. 
 I developed a taste for it when I was in med school in Tel-Aviv. 
 Two more, please. 
 No, thank you. 
 Med school? 
 Are you sure? 
 It's only good when it's served extremely cold, which this establishment appreciates. 
 When were you in med school? 
 Well, that's a different story. 
 Are you sure you don't want one? 
 Eyal, listen to me. 
 Always. 
 You're gonna be drinking alone tonight. 
 That's a pity. 
 The person you were planning to meet, you will never meet with again. 
 That sounds permanent. 
 And stop pretending to be CIA. 
 That's too bad, 'cause it's refreshingly uncomplicated. 
 Oh, here we go. 
 You see, remove all logic, s*x, weapons, initiative. 
 Replace it with calling your bosses every hour on the hour, endless amount of paperwork, and there you are. 
 CIA. 
 Good-lookin' and funny. 
 You mind me good-looking? 
 Eyal, stop. 
 I'm serious. 
 Enjoy your drink. 
 Oh, and fyi, the perfect Sazerac is at the best bar in the city, the Parchment. 
 You're wrong, you know? 
 See, what's, uh-- what's gonna happen is this. 
 You're gonna report back to your superiors that we talked, and they're gonna want to know why Mossad is here, why we're interested in this individual. 
 So they will task you, Annie Walker, with finding out, with following me. 
 You're never boring, I'll give you that. 
 Safe trip home. 
 He's right. 
 Excuse me. 
 He's right. 
 We do want to know what Mossad is doing here. 
 Rossabi's informant Jacob Yassen. 
 He's the son of a wealthy emir in the United Arab Emirates. 
 He lives in the U.S. and is part owner of an international construction firm. 
 And his firm is involved in various illicit activities here in the states and overseas. 
 Tom Ford azure lime, Jai? 
 The prodigal son has returned to the DPD. 
 The DCI wants special projects in on this one. 
 The Feds have had their hooks in Jacob for a while. 
 He turned informant to avoid prosecution on a bid-tampering charge. 
 Hence Agent Rossabi's concern. 
 Wouldn't say the mood at Hoover is concern. 
 I just got off the phone with them. 
 They're upset. 
 Why is Mossad pursuing this? 
 A black op on our soil, no heads-up? 
 Annie, I want you to run point on this. 
 Follow Eyal and determine why. 
 I'll back-channel King Saul Boulevard, which will no doubt prove fruitless. 
 What do I tell Rossabi? 
 Nothing. 
 Nothing? 
 It's need-to-know. 
 He doesn't need to know. 
 Not according to the DCI. 
 Collegial cooperation between domestic agencies. 
 In this case, they've been transparent with us. 
 Annie's my operative. 
 This is my call. 
 Tell Rossabi we need a day to drill down. 
 Translation, what's a little lying between friends? 
 [Horn sounds] 
 Vincent, I'm on it. 
 Yeah, I'm not sure what that means. 
 It means you were right. 
 I asked. There is someone in place. 
 Okay, is this person standing down? 
 We're into it. 
 Yeah, that fills me with confidence. 
 You asked me for a favor, and I delivered. 
 Yeah, the Smithsonian fills me with confidence and gratitude. 
 I thought we put that joke to bed. 
 I'm a creature of habit. 
 I mean, what do you expect from a guy who wears wing tips? 
 Walker? 
 Hello? 
 I gotta go. 
 Wait, hold-- 
 It's a lovely day. 
 Go ahead, say it. 
 What? 
 Oh, I told you so. 
 No, I'm bigger than that. 
 [Chuckles] 
 All right, not really. 
 Listen, um, since you're already following me, why don't you come and ride with me? 
 Come on. 
 Does this mean no tail? 
 As long as we're together. 
 Excellent. 
 Put your seatbelt on. 
 Or not, it's your choice. 
 I bought you a day to finish up whatever you need to finish up. 
 What if I want to start something new? 
 Then I need answers. 
 What do you wanna know? 
 Why are you working Jacob Yassen? 
 Yassen is of no importance to us, but he could put us in contact with someone who is. 
 Who? 
 A deep-cover asset Mossad has had in place for over a decade. 
 What's Mossad doing with an undercover asset in America? 
 Don't be naive. 
 All I can tell you is that he's gone silent. 
 We're worried. 
 Unlike some other unnamed agencies, we take care of our own. 
 It's a matter of national pride. 
 Along with the world's best hummus. 
 Hey, I thought you'd be excited. 
 I am. 
 Come on, you know what this means to me. 
 You know, Peace Corps is incredibly selective. 
 Not everyone gets to go, and they chose me. 
 I'm excited, I'm excited. 
 No, you're not. 
 Look at you. 
 All right, it's just... 
 Eritrea? 
 Okay, it's not the garden spot of the planet, I know. 
 Garden spot, no. 
 Troubled and dangerous, yes. 
 Okay, you're worried, and that is very sweet. 
 But it's not forever. 
 It's two years. 
 I just wanna go somewhere where I'm needed. 
 And there's need there in so many ways. 
 Women's rights, Auggie-- 
 Are virtually nonexistent. 
 Can't you just be happy for me? 
 I am. 
 And proud. 
 Very. 
 You told your folks? 
 Not yet. 
 I have time. 
 Four months. 
 [Tires squeal] 
 What's your mission? 
 Meet with our asset, assess the risk, bring him home if I deem necessary. 
 Just standard protocol. 
 And that's it? 
 [Speaking Hebrew] 
 [Speaking Hebrew] 
 Wow, listen to you. 
 I'm hurt. 
 Remember, I'm the guy who cooked for you. 
 How many men have cooked for you, huh? 
 Actually? 
 Well, cooked organically. 
 You lied to me yesterday. 
 Why should I believe you now? Or ever? 
 It's Thursday. I don't lie on Thursdays. 
 What are you doing? 
 The FBI are preventing me from meeting with my asset. 
 So it's time for plan "B". 
 What's plan "B"? 
 Jacob brings his girlfriends here. 
 Daddy doesn't know about this place and neither do the mouth-breathers over at the FBI. 
 What? 
 You wanna see how I collect information? 
 Watch this. 
 So where is he? 
 [Groaning] 
 I don't have it. I told you, I don't know. 
 [Groans] 
 What the hell are you doing? 
 Plan "B". 
 This is a mistake. 
 Jacob, we just need a moment of your time. 
 Just for the record, whatever he's into I'm not a part of it. 
 I swear. 
 Okay, like I said, sometimes my colleague can be a little out of control, and we apologize. 
 We apologize? 
 I can leave? 
 No. 
 Of course. 
 Or stay. We'll just be a minute. 
 Actually, I was just leaving. 
 Call me. 
 She's gonna be on her cell to the cops-- 
 George, or whatever you're calling yourself today, would you focus? 
 You said your name was Antonio. 
 Who are you people? 
 Jacob, look at me. 
 Never mollycoddle an asset. That's rule one, chapter one. 
 All I need from you is an introduction. 
 One introduction, and we're gone. 
 Really? 
 That's it, and it ends. 
 Introduction to who? 
 Good question. 
 I don't-- 
 Listen. 
 Don't let my friend here fool you. 
 I will do what I must. 
 Jacob, we just need to know how to reach him. 
 Okay. 
 All I am is a messenger. 
 I pass along information. 
 That's all. 
 I leave a mark. 
 I call a number. 
 I wait an hour. 
 If he agrees to meet, there will be a mark. 
 That's all I know. 
 After you leave your mark, what then? 
 I said I wait an hour. 
 [Sighs] 
 I like the water. It calms me. 
 I park near the basin and wait. 
 I've got some tape in my kit. 
 What, are you going to war? 
 Every day. 
 Make the call. 
 So we release him after this, Antonio. 
 It was better than George. 
 Hey! 
 Don't just leave me here. 
 So you said medical school? 
 Did you finish? 
 No. 
 What happened? 
 2002, my family needed me, and, uh, so I took a leave of absence, never went back. 
 "Dr. Lavin" has kind of a nice ring to it. 
 You and my mother. 
 You regret not going back? 
 No. 
 It's different in Israel. 
 Our ambitions are about life, living well, not our careers. 
 What about having both? 
 See, now that's very American. 
 Life takes you where it takes you. 
 You can only steer so much, sometimes not at all. 
 History taught us that. 
 Don't fight the current, is that it? 
 Or swim with it. 
 Instead of fighting, live your life. 
 Yeah, the current may know something you don't. 
 Doesn't sound like you at all. 
 Why not? 
 It's completely me. 
 Sometimes you just have to let the river take you. 
 And where has the river taken you? 
 Today... 
 It's taken me here. 
 With you. 
 You guys, I'm thirsty! 
 [Sighs] 
 I got it. 
 Thanks. 
 
 
 
 [Knock on door] 
 Auggie. 
 Joan, I have a favor to ask. 
 Maybe I've come at the wrong time. 
 Auggie. 
 I have this friend. 
 You have this friend. 
 Who's received an assignment with the Peace Corps to serve in, of all places, Eritrea. 
 Hmm. 
 Exactly. 
 So this friend... 
 Is the sister of a soldier I served with in Iraq. 
 She's all her parents have left. 
 I just-- 
 Auggie, you realize the Agency has no official involvement with the Peace Corps. 
 I'm not asking officially. 
 You're just asking? 
 Which is something I have never done. 
 This family's been through a lot. 
 I'd like to spare them and her, if I can. 
 So you want a reassignment, that's what you're asking? 
 Service is still service. 
 No matter where it occurs, it doesn't make the need any less valuable. 
 Write a letter. 
 Make a request. 
 I'll make sure it gets in the right hands. 
 But there are no guarantees. 
 Of course, I understand. 
 Thank you. 
 Auggie. 
 Glad you came to me. 
 I'd like to know who we're going to meet. 
 I already told you. 
 Yeah, and then you needlessly manhandled our passenger here. 
 Definitely needlessly. 
 Who is it? 
 Put this on him, please. 
 Come here. 
 Van Halen. 
 David Lee Roth era, the good stuff. 
 Enjoy. 
 I only know him by his code name. 
 Cardinal. 
 That's a start, an asset named Cardinal. 
 Not an asset. 
 Civilians get alphanumeric designations. 
 What is he? 
 He's a Mossad operative. 
 But he's not spying on any U.S. interests. 
 Yeah, who is he spying on? 
 Not the U.S. 
 I have to call Langley and check in. 
 Hey! 
 I can't believe you did that. 
 What is it with you and cell phones? 
 What is it with you and always checking in? 
 Ah-- 
 You know what, it feels good. You should try it. 
 Might be liberating. 
 Give me your phone. 
 Absolutely not. 
 Eyal. 
 Forget it. 
 It switched to Abba. 
 Do you have this on shuffle? 
 You owe me a phone. 
 Look, I've done what you wanted. 
 What's your next protocol? 
 Dude, I feel really light-headed. 
 Once we have eyes on your man, you'll be released. 
 Just... 
 Just drive straight and take a left on "C" street. 
 It's just up there on the right. 
 What's this? 
 [Honks horn] 
 He set us up. He set us up! 
 Annie. 
 Come on, come on. 
 Whoa, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go. 
 [Tires squeal] 
 [Emergency sirens] 
 Take a step back. 
 Move it. 
 More. 
 You took care of it for me, huh? 
 You just ruined my afternoon, and now my informant, after three years of work, is dead. 
 I understand your frustration. 
 Do you really? 
 Because the last time I saw you, you were a lawyer. 
 She's Smithsonian and who the hell knows who this guy is. 
 It's a damn costume party! 
 I am here to set things straight, so-- 
 Okay, well, let me tell you something. 
 The stink is sure as hell gonna reach your office because my boss is talking to your boss. 
 This has not gone vertical, this has gone ballistic. 
 Let's stick to the matters at hand, shall we? 
 Ms. Walker here will remain and debrief your people. 
 This individual is not who he says he is. 
 I've been ordered to ship him home. 
 Where is home? 
 The Middle East. 
 Israel. 
 He's Mossad. 
 I'm looking that he talks. 
 Our intention is to extend to you every courtesy we can, even though it may not appear that way with some of us. 
 That your version of an apology? 
 [Knock on door] 
 Listen, uh, not that I don't appreciate the hospitality, but I don't debrief. 
 Good. 'Cause we're not interested. 
 Your superiors, however, are. 
 You have an appointment at King Saul, and I hear individuals there are very anxious to hear your thoughts. 
 Let's go. 
 And you will not be back. Ever. 
 If it were up to me, I would personally walk you to your cell and throw the key away. 
 Take him to his plane. 
 Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. No, no. 
 Let's talk. 
 No doubt you can find your way out. 
 You are spooks, after all. 
 You are either personally undermining me or your promotion has affected your better judgement-- if such a thing ever existed. 
 In the future, if you have anything to say to me, you will hold your tongue and speak to me privately. 
 Or better yet, keep it to yourself. 
 Do my ears deceive me? 
 A friendly face. 
 Nice job with a tough situation. 
 Tough girls tough it out. 
 I like it. 
 You want the good news or the good news? 
 Yes, please. 
 FBI rolled up one of the shooters. 
 He talked. 
 The Bureau's planning on taking down Eyal's man tonight, and once that happens, everybody wins, and you are off the hook, Annie Walker. 
 Eyal said his name was Cardinal. 
 FBI is being tight-lipped. 
 Mossad isn't returning Joan's calls. 
 Upstairs ordered an NIE. 
 Until then, we don't know. 
 Eyal said he's a Mossad op. 
 Oh, he's anything but that. 
 Arab desk thinks he might be a Yemeni hitter, but whatever he is, justice is holding him on a conspiracy to murder charge. 
 Give state time to do their thing. 
 This isn't your fault, and no one thinks that. 
 What about Eyal? 
 He's got this own problems. 
 Halfway across the Atlantic. 
 A Yemeni hitter, huh? 
 Chatter says he may have been involved in the '02 peace talks thing. 
 Do remember that? 
 The Golan Heights massacre? Stopped the talks? 
 2002? 
 Yeah. 
 Huh. 
 You okay? 
 Uh, yeah, thanks. I'll see you later. 
 You're right. Pretty good. 
 Somehow I knew you'd be here... 
 But how? 
 They put me on a commercial flight. 
 Turns out, the air marshal was a former Mossad Agent. 
 It's more common than people know. 
 Good money. Decent hours. Travel the world. 
 Who wouldn't hire Mossad, right? 
 So, uh, he did me a favor. 
 The FBI should know better. 
 Looks like you did. 
 You're not gonna leave until you've finished, are you? 
 There's nothing humanitarian about your mission. 
 You're here to kill Cardinal. 
 Let me get you a drink. Uh, two more, please. 
 Macallan. Eighteen. Neat. 
 Cardinal's real name is Fouad Saeed. 
 In 2002, when I was in med school in Tel Aviv, Saeed entered a kibbutz near the Golan Heights, assassinated an IDF guard and six kibbutzniks. 
 He was hoping to poison the peace talks. 
 One of the civilians killed was my sister. 
 I love my country and I would do anything for it, but Fouad Saeed is the reason I became a Mossad Agent. 
 Thank you. 
 Nine years, two months, eight days. 
 Her name was Sarah, after our grandmother, who died in Treblinka. 
 Why are you here, Annie Walker? 
 This is a suicide mission. 
 Don't do it. 
 It's not what your sister would want. 
 Well, you didn't know my sister. 
 This is exactly what she would have wanted. 
 See, we know this is when you fight the current. 
 Again, why are you still here, Annie Walker? 
 Huh. Classic honey-trap. 
 It's for your own good. 
 Of course, I saw it coming. 
 I mean, you need to work on your technique. 
 There's nothing wrong with my technique. 
 I was simply being a gentleman. 
 The FBI is gonna take down Saeed, and your inclinations to play by your own rules will undoubtedly get in the way, so-- 
 You think this will hold me? 
 Long enough for my needs. 
 If this is how you treat a man, I think I like it. 
 As soon as the FBI has Saeed in custody, I'll come back and, uh, set you free. 
 Where are you going? 
 I gotta make a phone call. 
 And since someone threw my phone out of a moving car-- 
 [laughs] 
 I gotta say, I'm, uh, I'm impressed. 
 I'll be right back. 
 I'll be here. 
 Auggie, where are we at with the, uh-- 
 Huh. Interesting number. 
 I lost my phone. 
 We know. 
 We've been pondering that and other things. 
 Eyal never made it to Israel. 
 What have we got from the FBI? 
 Impeccable timing as always, Walker. 
 Just got off the wire. 
 Feds traced a tip from the shooter to an apartment in Anacostia. 
 Cardinal wasn't there. Hoover building is in a tizzy. 
 How does that happen? 
 Look, Auggie, I have Eyal. 
 He didn't leave. We're at the Chatham. 
 Are you with him now? 
 No, he's in his room, but, uh-- oh, my God. 
 What? 
 He's here. 
 Who? 
 Cardinal. 
 Are you certain? 
 Yes. It's him and two friends. 
 Eyal knew. That's why he stayed. 
 He knew they'd come. 
 Jai has a team in the field. Annie, they're en route. 
 Do not handle by yourself. 
 [Elevator bell dings] 
 I gotta go. 
 [Elevator bell dings] 
 [Elevator bell dings] 
 [Tires screech] 
 Jai, she needs you there now! 
 Copy that. 
 [Tires screech] 
 I'm here. 
 We've got three bogies in the elevator. 
 One of them is Saeed. 
 They're on their way to the eighth floor. 
 Annie's taking the stairs. 
 [Silenced gunshot] 
 [Gunshot] 
 You okay? 
 Yeah, yeah. 
 [Sirens in distance] 
 Okay, okay. 
 [Indistinct radio chatter] 
 Let me get this straight. Who shot who? 
 He didn't shoot anyone. 
 You shot him. 
 Yeah. Yeah, that's right. 
 Self defense. 
 I still don't even know who you are. 
 This is the last time I ask you for a favor. 
 Thanks. 
 Anytime. 
 You knew he'd come. 
 So what now? 
 I guess I'll see where the current takes me. 
 This is not a change of assignment letter. 
 It is my "close and continuing relationship" form. 
 I realize that the reason I don't want her to go to Eritrea is the same reason I don't want her to go anywhere. 
 We have four months left until she leaves and I plan on making the most of it. 
 Per protocol, I'm informing the Agency. 
 Lucky girl. 
 [Laughs lightly] 
 [Knocks on desk] 
 [Door closes] 
 A Sazerac. Ice cold, please. 
 Sure.
