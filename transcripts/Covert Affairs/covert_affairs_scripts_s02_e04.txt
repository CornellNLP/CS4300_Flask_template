 This is how any properly executed spy exchange should go. 
 You take delivery of the prisoner at the airport. 
 In this case, one Carlo Reni, Italian A.I.S.E., recently arrested by the FBI for domestic spying. 
 Yes, Dorothy, allies spy on allies. 
 [Indie rock music] 
 ♪ ♪ 
 You will fly to the designated exchange location in Argentina, which, by the way, is gorgeous in the summer. 
 But it's summer here now, meaning-- oh, well, you'll see. 
 You will land at a lovely little bit of paradise in the middle of nowhere, 90 miles as the crow flies northeast of Buenos Aires. 
 Perfect for the quiet, off-the-record, slightly frosty exchange of foreign operatives. 
 You will then make the exchange just as you made the pickup. 
 You'll be on the ground all of five minutes and everyone returns home. 
 Easy-peasy-- that's how it's done. 
 So, Annie Walker, have yourself a lovely flight. 
 [Speaking Italian] 
 [Speaking Italian] 
 You speak Italian? 
 Interesting. 
 Blonde, Nordic forehead, and lovely mediterranean eyes. 
 You have a drop of Italian in you maybe? 
 I'm American. 
 But before that. 
 Before that, I was American. 
 Hmm. 
 And you-- darker features, which suggest Southern Italy, which is rare for a spy, but your dialect is actually Romano. 
 Roma, of course-- there is no south in me. 
 Below Roma, it's mostly peasants. 
 And I'm not a spy. I'm a journalist. 
 Right. 
 Per favore, signorina,  it is very hard for an Italian to talk without his hands. 
 Forget it. 
 Maybe I will have some peanuts. 
 [Tires screech] 
 [Clears throat] 
 Sit tight. 
 I'll be back. 
 I-I said sit tight. 
 That's not something I'm good at--sit tight. 
 Fine. Stay close. 
 So how does a woman like you end up in a dirty trade like this? 
 Is it God, country, apple cake? 
 Pie. 
 Excuse me? 
 God, country, apple pie. 
 Cake is better. 
 Or  panna cotta.  Oh! 
 God, country, and  panna cotta. 
 Annie. 
 We're on the ground. 
 Welcome to sunny Argentina. How was your flight? 
 Talkative. 
 But not hard on the eyes, I'm told. 
 I didn't notice. 
 Well, of course not. Neither would I. 
 Auggie, where's our contact? 
 We're here alone. 
 Out dealing with weather. 
 Hurricane-force winds in the South Atlantic. 
 They were forced to land in the Falklands. 
 The Falklands is 250 miles from here. 
 Well, you're in paradise with a handsome Italian. 
 Adapt, overcome, make small talk. 
 That's your advice? 
 Sorry. 
 Late night. 
 Uh, they do expect to be wheels up, hopefully within two hours, weather permitting. 
 Perfect. 
 Excuse me? 
 I got to go. 
 Don't be a stranger. 
 [Grunts] 
 Really, Carlo? 
 Oh! 
 There's nothing around here for miles. 
 [Both grunt] 
 Where do you think you're going? 
 Oh! Ow! 
 [Groans] 
 What were you gonna do-- run all the way to Buenos Aires? 
 Ugh, if I have to. 
 No, no, no, no, no, no. I'm not going back to Italy. 
 There are people there who are very anxious to silence me. 
 You saying there's something worse than the CIA waiting for you? Oh, you don't believe me? 
 My job is to deliver you safely, and that's what I'm gonna do. 
 [Groans] 
 You know, I changed my mind. 
 [Car approaches] 
 There is nothing Italian about you. 
 [Car doors open and close] 
 [Silenced gunshot] 
 Run. 
 What? 
 Run! 
 [Silenced gunshots]

Original Air Date on June 28, 2011 
 [Carlo grunting] 
 Come on! 
 Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! 
 You don't have a gun? 
 No. 
 My agency is no doubt talking to your agency right now, consulting with the Argentineans and developing a safe and smooth exit for us. 
 We'll be fine. 
 Come on. Let's go. 
 This is a disaster. 
 This was a favor, Joan. A professional courtesy... 
 I'm aware of that. 
 Based on personal assurances and our long friendship! 
 May I suggest you take a breath, Jorge? 
 No, Romano, I will not take a breath, and I take exception to that! 
 I was made assurances this would be a simple proposition. 
 Two allies, simple exchange, 30 minutes tops. 
 Now I have two international spies and an assassin loose in my country! 
 And we have every intention of rectifying that, Jorge. 
 Really? How? 
 Please, I won't be snapped at! 
 We are each in a predicament here. 
 Ay, dios mio! 
 What predicament are you in? 
 Gentlemen, please. 
 My hands are tied, Joan. 
 It would be one thing if we shared the details with our departments of state, but I was asked not to. 
 What are you saying, Jorge? 
 I like my job. I plan to keep it. 
 If I catch either operative, I will arrest them as foreign spies. 
 That would mean jail. 
 You're being a fool. 
 I'm sorry, Joan. 
 You would do the same if you were in my shoes. 
 Signal's gone. 
 Huh. Both signals. 
 That was... 
 Interesting. 
 What do you want to do? 
 I have a feeling our domestic colleagues at the FBI haven't been completely forthright with us about our Mr. Reni. I'm on it. 
 State? Open a back channel? 
 No, not yet. 
 Liaise with the D.O.D.? 
 I have a different duty for you--you're to see Arthur. 
 We're in the middle of an op. 
 Mm-hmm. 
 And Jai's gonna handle it. Annie's in good hands. 
 Arthur's waiting for you. 
 [Carlo grunting] 
 [Breathing heavily] 
 Oh! Whew! 
 [Gasping, breathing heavily] 
 I-I-I-- 
 I had a tryout with A.C. Fiorentina-- yeah, midfielder. 
 I hurt my knee, and they still wanted to sign me, but-- 
 We need to keep moving. I don't want to lose the light. 
 Ah, well, we need a plan. 
 I have a plan. 
 I don't trust your plan. 
 Well, I don't remember asking you to. 
 I know the perfect place. 
 I have friends in a little beach town outside Mar del Plata-- Italian. 
 Neapolitan, but they're good people. 
 She makes a stuffed calamari with squid ink. 
 Ho-ho!  Molto bene. 
 We're going this way. 
 It's really good. 
 It's protocol. 
 Protocol? 
 Yeah, which already saved your life once. 
 Uh-huh, yeah, I realize your boss requires a blind allegiance and slavish devotion, okay? 
 We don't have time for this. 
 But I know for a fact that your agency's in league with the people who are trying to kill me. 
 You understand? 
 You're like a dog with a bone. 
 And I know that I'm absolutely right. 
 You're not right. 
 Absolutely. 
 Not this time. 
 Now, please. 
 To where? 
 I'm gonna take you to a safe location in Buenos Aires. 
 Oh, okay. 
 Once there, I check in. 
 If everything's okay, I'll take you to the Italian embassy. 
 Hey, hey, no. 
 Yes. 
 Ah! 
 [Speaking Italian] 
 Nightmare. Don't worry. 
 By tonight, you'll be home safe in Italy, and all this will be over. 
 [Grunts] 
 I don't know how people like you sleep at night. 
 I know you felt you owed me, sir, but a promotion? 
 This would be a substantial change in your life-- a staff, your own office on the seventh floor. 
 Whoa. A view. 
 A bump in grade means a bump in pay-- a significant one. 
 Next, you're gonna offer me a new parking space. 
 [Chuckles] 
 [Chuckles] 
 Two spaces down from mine. 
 Two spaces south is the D.D.I. 
 He's not going anywhere. 
 Two spaces north... 
 Office of Congressional Affairs? 
 We think you'd be perfect. 
 You want me in O.C.A.? 
 We want you to run O.C.A. 
 Charlie's going green badge. 
 He's got kids to put through college. 
 Plus, it's time for newer blood, younger blood. 
 Well, that would mean-- 
 Yes, Auggie. 
 You'd be overt. 
 I could never go in the field again. 
 Yeah, that's right. 
 Once you step in front of the cameras, it's-- 
 I remember when I did it. 
 It was a big step. 
 You'd be one of three public faces for the CIA-- the D.C.I., me, and you. 
 [Chuckles] 
 Here I thought I was in trouble. 
 Oh, this is a hell of an opportunity-- a career maker. 
 And honestly... 
 We're not exactly pulling you from the field. 
 The D.C.I. and I agree. 
 We both think you are the right man for the job. 
 I'm speechless. 
 Well, you'd have to work on that. 
 You can't be speechless on this job. 
 When? 
 You'd start next week. 
 So you need to give it some serious thought. 
 Carlo Reni was arrested by the FBI two days ago for reading the trash at the Bureau of Land Management here in D.C. 
 He said he was investigating a story for-- 
 I know. I know. 
 He stuck to his cover. I know this. 
 Tell me what I don't know. 
 The FBI had him all of five hours before the Italian A.I.S.E. offered up a trade. 
 Did you know that? 
 No. 
 Which means, of course-- 
 His own agency blew his cover. 
 He knows something. 
 What? 
 He said he was only in the country for five days before he was arrested. 
 Where was he before that? 
 A lot of traveling-- mostly South America, working his cover. 
 Before that, some Middle East visits. 
 He was kicked out of Iran for publishing articles "Libelous and unfavorable to the government." 
 What does Persia House say? 
 That he was kicked out for his story, ostensibly. 
 They have him on a watch list. 
 Get Genaro. I want a face-to-face. 
 Auggie. Joan. 
 Good meeting? 
 Interesting meeting. 
 What can I do? 
 I want confirmation that there is a jet on the ground in the Falklands. 
 I want to know whether or not we're being played. 
 I can do that. 
 And someone please find out who the opposition is. 
 If we have a hitter in the field, I want to know who it is. 
 [Cows mooing] 
 And this is probably where you steal some hapless peasant's vehicle, his only worldly possession-- typical. 
 Actually, this is where I buy it. 
 Buenos dias! 
 But you would have stolen it. 
 Let me drive. I know the way. 
 In Italy, a woman never drives. 
 The man drives. 
 We're not in Italy. 
 Fine. 
 Get us lost. 
 We're not lost. 
 It's only a matter of time. 
 Auggie? 
 Got a signal, I think, at least that's what N.G.A. tells me, but they might be playing with me. 
 Officially, it's in customs' hold. 
 Passengers and crew are still aboard. 
 Can we get eyes on the ground? 
 Working on it. 
 What about Genaro at the Italian embassy? 
 I'm making arrangements. 
 Word is, he'd like to speak with you, too. 
 Good. 
 Anything on our hitter? 
 One possible-- a Helmut Drum. 
 He arrived in Buenos Aires on a flight from London yesterday morning-- former Chechen separatist, noted involvement in death squads, ties to the usual unsavory suspects, mostly Eastern Europe. 
 It's believed he's independent. 
 European ties, anglo appearance makes him a good commodity in certain markets. 
 Now he's in Argentina. 
 He fits Annie's description. 
 I profiled this guy for the U.K. desk. 
 He is not a true believer anymore. 
 He is all about the money. 
 He's the real deal. Let's give Annie a heads-up. 
 Already tried. Can't reach her. 
 Try again. 
 Yep. 
 [Engine sputtering] 
 This wouldn't happen if you let me drive. 
 I would kill for a macchiato. 
 Speaking of which... 
 Any idea who wants you dead? 
 Now you want to know? 
 Might be helpful. 
 People in your line of work, maybe people you know. 
 I don't know people like that. 
 And I don't work with people like that. 
 You keep saying you're not a spy, and yet consider the circumstances. 
 I admit to making certain parties unhappy. 
 It's the nature of my work. 
 The only thing we have in common-- 
 I'm not the one with an assassin after him. 
 The free press has its enemies in your country and mine. 
 I'll give you one thing, Carlo. 
 Whatever you are, you talk a good game. 
 I'll give you that. 
 [Engine sputtering, turning] 
 Alternator belt. 
 It's not pretty, but it'll hold. 
 Another thing I'm not-- mechanical. 
 If I found you a macchiato, you think that might jog your memory about who's after us? 
 Maybe. 
 [Chuckles] 
 But no caramel or whipped cream. 
 It's coffee. It's not an apple pie. 
 [Rooster crowing, wind chimes ringing] 
 [Dog barks] 
 [Dog barks] 
 Look, Internet-- 
 I could check my blog. 
 [Chuckles] 
 Classic. 
 Perfect journal cover. 
 We both know there's nothing on your blog. 
 No? 
 Let's go. 
 I'll show you what I've dedicated my life to, why people follow my work, even Americans. 
 How many people in Argentina do you think are logged on to your blog right now? 
 My guess is only you. 
 I happen to have a, uh, devoted following in Tierra del Fuego. 
 Whosever after us will be watching it. 
 As soon as you log on, they'd have us. 
 So... 
 No. 
 And as far as the Argentinean authorities are concerned, you and I are both spies. 
 They find us, we go to jail. 
 Jail doesn't scare me. 
 It's a censored press that scares me. 
 Come on. 
 Treat time. 
 [Chuckles] 
 Gracias. 
 [Indistinct radio broadcast] 
 Ooh! Milanesa! 
 Eggs, crumbs, little rub, quick fry. 
 Oh! 
 Oh, ho-ho! 
 Mm-hmm. 
 Argentine beef-- the second-best in the world. 
 It's one of the reasons I love Argentina. 
 Frankly, I prefer  parrillada. 
 Oh,  parrillada. Bene. 
 Macchiato. 
 Marked. 
 [Chuckles] 
 I know the saucer's not heated, but when in Argentina... 
 You like me. 
 I can tell. 
 [Chuckles] 
 No, we have what we Romans call  "simpatia." 
 You feel it, too, yes? 
 [Chuckles] 
 It's the common space, the mortar between the bricks, the words between the words-- courage... 
 Passion, principles. 
 Simpatia. 
 This is... maybe you and me. 
 You are either the best operative I have ever seen or the absolute worst. 
 I can't make up my mind. 
 I couldn't do what you do. 
 I trust people. They trust me. 
 It's how I do my job. 
 Me too. 
 People trust me. 
 Lots of people trust me, in fact. 
 And what does the CIA ask you to do with this "trust"? 
 Today they're having me protect and deliver a foreign operative. 
 You know what? Treat time's over. Let's go. 
 You know what, Carlo? 
 You have us wrong. 
 Uh-huh. 
 You got me wrong. 
 I need to, um, use the... without assistance. 
 [Laughs] 
 Oh, no. 
 I-I promise on my mother's grave, I will not run away. 
 Ah!  Scusa. 
 Scusa. Grazie. [Sighs] Your mom's not really dead, is she? Policia federal. That's a good thing, yes? That's not a good thing. What are they doing here? Hmm, it's Argentina. They're probably-- [Glass shatters] [Silenced gunshots] Get down! What are you doing? [Shouting in Spanish] Carlo, I need you to be quiet right now. Grab something. What? [Tires screeching] [Grunts] [Gunshots] And this is where I'm not supposed to argue? Do you see him? No. Maybe  policia  got him. Oh, I doubt it. How did he find us? I don't know. Here you go. I'm very worried, Romano. I'm exposed here. Joan, of course, you know I'm sympathetic. This piece of cake we planned has turned into a disaster for me. Keeping this on the sly has been a total mistake. I can't do it anymore. I have to go vertical with this, Romano. What? Let's not lose our heads, dear. I don't know. I'm very confused. I need to tell my boss. I need to tell the State Department. I have to read them in on this, or it will be my ass... In a very nasty and very permanent way. Joan, listen to me. I won't let you go down. I promise. We are all on the hook here, dear, not just you. We are in this together. I don't know about that. Okay, look, I understand your concern. Just give me a few hours. It's all going to work out. I guess, if you think it'll work. Good. Good. Genaro fell for it. He's dirty. We're being played. I'm sure of it. Pleading, "We're in this together"? Right. Actually, there was a problem. Annie busted through a police barricade. There's a countrywide A.P.B. out on her. What do you want me to do? Change directives. Let's move on an extraction. 
 
 [Engine sputtering] [Engine stalls, air hissing] [Coughs] Take your clothes off. Uh, pardon me? There's no way that hitter could have known where we were. Take 'em off. Um... For heaven sakes. I'll step outside. No, that--ah. When you were in custody, did anyone come to visit you? Uh, yes. One person from the embassy. So what? Who? He didn't say his name. Did anyone else have access to where you were or your things? No. You didn't check your clothes. No. Why would I? That's how the hitter found us. He must have planted it on you when you met. Get dressed. We're on foot from here. Are you kidding? "Get dressed. Take it off. Run. Come here. Stop. Go there." [Sighs] [Speaking Italian] Again? It's for your own good. Yeah, sure. Whatever. You know, I bet you never had an Italian boyfriend. Oh, which would change my life forever, no doubt. You joke, but you ask any woman, she'll tell you. We know things. You, however-- you're a lost cause. Are you really this person? Eh. I'm trying to keep us alive, and you're interested in my boyfriends? Well, I'm trying to help your love life-- You want to help me? Tell me who's trying to kill you. [Sighs] Well-- Unless a woman shouldn't know these things. Look, I mean-- I think it's about a story I've been working on... about the O.C.U. The Italian oil conglomerate? Yes, exactly, and the Italian government. It's a conspiracy? My sources are connected to certain government officials. It's about the oil rigs here in South America. I want to get you to a safe house. [Crowd cheering] They say, "Follow the money." Well, I followed the money, and here I am. They know I'm close to publishing. I have corroboration-- how they bribed and extorted to get their share of the San Jorge oil fields. They want to stop me. They need to stop me. I am not a spy. I'm a writer. I've been working on this story for two years. Someone wants me back in Italy to-- to stop me from publishing. The Italian embassy may not be the place to go. Finally. But we can't go to the U.S. embassy either. Why? It's complicated. [Cell phone rings] Yeah? Where are you? We're in the city. You are not safe. The local authorities have your descriptions. Not surprising. We're working on an extraction. You are not to go to the Italian embassy. Understood? Yeah. I-I already figured that out. Are either of you injured? No, we're good. The package may not be what we thought it was. Well, I don't think anyone is who we think they are. Either way, your safety is what's important. Auggie's working on a possible exit. "Possible"? Highly probable, though still in the formative stages. I need you to get to the U.S. President's Line terminal at the wharf. U.S. President's line at Buenos Aires or La Cotta? Buenos Aires, berth 28. I'll have more information when you get there. Just get there and be safe. And there's another detail you need to be aware of. Annie, we've discovered that two of Carlo's contacts have turned up dead in the past 24 hours. Both were employed by O.C.U. He told me he's working on a story about O.C.U. Their names are Rinaldo and Vasquez. Keep your head down. Get to the wharf. We'll get you out. What? Rinaldo and Vasquez-- does that mean anything? Two of my sources. Why? They're dead. We have to get to the wharf. My agency's gonna try and get us out of here. But, but-- Carlo. Carlo, I'm sorry. I know this is hard, but we have to move. I'm responsible. They put their faith in me, and now they're dead. The police are looking for us. It'll all be for nothing if you get caught and go to jail. We have to move, now. [Speaking spanish] Uh, oh... Sorry. [Crowd cheering] I need to talk to the editor, please. Claro que si. Annie, how-- how did you know? Where else would a writer go? A writer? Look, we are still in danger, and I am still responsible for you. When did you decide that-- We don't have time for this. We need to get to the extraction point. I am glad. I really am, but I have to do this. No, you need to trust me. I do trust you... Mostly. But I trust this too. Look, if I'm going to get killed, Annie, which at this point is fairly probable, then I have to get my story out. I have to. I made promises, and I want to keep those promises. How do you know they'll print it? I don't. But it's not the battles won, Annie. It's the battles waged. You can understand that... If you are who I think you are. Make it quick. You think I have an ulterior motive? Frankly, yes. We all have motives. We're told that in our training, to expect it. You think mine are suspect due to my circumstances? No, sir. Due to my circumstances. Uh-huh. You're in a public relations battle, and I'm the feel-good hit of the summer. [Chuckles] That's ballsy, Auggie. Good for you. I have my reasons, sure. And, yes, I am fighting for my career. So what? It's irrelevant. There's never a clean game board, Auggie, never. Gets more complicated the higher you climb. Up or down, yes or no. Your decision, your terms. To hell with me or what I may or may not need. And I wouldn't worry about me too much if I were you. I still have a few teeth in my head. Question-- who would I answer to? The D.C.I. and me. And what about...Perks? What do you have in mind? Say I wanted an extraction in a foreign country. [Laughs] I thought you were gonna ask for a wet bar. [Carlo speaking spanish] His people are working on the same story. He's got a reporter in the San Jorge Gulf, and I also got a name. I know who visited me when I was in custody. Who? Genaro. Romano Genaro. He's Italian intelligence. He gets a cut on any oil extracted-- potentially millions. I knew I was making someone in the government unhappy, someone pulling strings. I didn't know until now. He's in for a big surprise. What's the best way to the wharf? Genaro's our man. He's been assisting the Italian oil conglomerate O.C.U. And coercing oil leases. Carlo Reni's investigations were about to uncover that and name names. That's why Genaro was so anxious to keep this off the official channels. So much for professional courtesy. Reni is not a spy. But, Joan, this doesn't change the facts on the ground. Jorge-- Your operative crashed through a police checkpoint and assaulted a local policeman. I'm bringing her in. Do not threaten me. This is my operative at risk. And this is the business we're in, Joan. You do your job. I'll do mine. Jorge, sometime, somewhere... We will have future business. Do not think for a minute that your harming one of my people will not have a deep impact on our relationship. Annie, what's he doing here? Someone at the newspaper must have tipped him off. What? What? I'm gonna uncuff you. Give me your word. Yeah. I want you to stay right here, and I'll be back. No, wait, wait, wait. What are you going to do? Keep you safe. [Loud metallic bang] [Key clattering, water splashes] Your people are not coming. They're coming. No. The minute things became complicated, you became dispensable. It's easier to just let us die. You're wrong. The people I work for don't think of me as dispensable, or you. They'll be here. Come on. [Indistinct chatter] [All grunting] You okay? Uh-huh. [Groans] [Helicopter approaching] That's our ride. We have a visual on them. Extraction team has them in sight. [Tires screeching] Local police are on the scene. Standing by. [Indistinct radio chatter] My compliments... eluding my men, staying alive. But this is the end of the road. [Gunshot] Enough. Miss, you and Mr. Reni will leave my country as quickly as possible. Tell Joan I look forward to our next time. I will. We're 5 by 5, both packages on board. Over and out. Mr. Genaro, would you care to add anything to your statement regarding the attack on a U.S. operative in Argentina? He offered you the job, didn't he? Looks like you're his boy now.
