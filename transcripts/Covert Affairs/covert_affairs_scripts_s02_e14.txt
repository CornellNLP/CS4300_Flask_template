 [Bell tolling] 
 [Speaking Russian] 
 Was that the gun? 
 There's like 20,000 people in front of us. 
 It's gonna be a while before we go. 
 I'm actually kinda surprised you showed up. 
 I mean that in a good way. 
 I just didn't know that you had kept training after you moved out. 
 Yeah, got up at 6:00 a.m. every morning. 
 And you got the time off from work. 
 Because usually-- 
 Hey. 
 I'm here. 
 Okay? 
 [Buzzer] 
 [Buzzer] 
 [Buzzer] 
 Ten years at the agency I could never get a meeting with the DCS and now... he drives all the way out here to Petersburg just to see me. 
 Max Langford. 
 The face of a traitor. 
 I figured that sort of reductive jingoism might be beneath you. 
 What do you call a CIA analyst convicted on 12 counts of treason? 
 A patriot? 
 I doubt you came all the way out here just to insult me. 
 Does the name Yuri Trubachev mean anything to you? 
 Yeah, he's a top engineer for the Russian nuclear program. 
 He's a CIA asset since the end of the Cold War. 
 You know he was murdered yesterday in Red Square. 
 They don't exactly allow me to surf the web around here. 
 There are only 12 people at the Agency that knew Trubachev was CIA asset. 
 I'm looking for information on how his identity could have been compromised. 
 I spend 23 hours a day walking around a 68-square-foot room and I can count on one hand the number of human beings that I have spoken to in the last year. 
 Forgive me if I don't weep with sympathy for your living conditions. 
 That's funny, you know... 
 An American sells a secret to the Russians, he's a traitor. 
 But a Russian sells secrets to us, and he's a hero. 
 And a man who sells out his agency... is a prisoner. 
 Have a nice life. 
 Wish I could help you. 
 Joan. Call in your team. 
 Langford doesn't just know something about this murder... 
 He's behind it.

 Is she wearing jeans? 
 For a marathon? 
 I mean, the chafing. 
 [Giggling] 
 I missed this. 
 Us. 
 Annie. We need you back in the office. 
 If this is some elaborate scam to get you out of running, I'd actually be pretty impressed. 
 I guess I gotta go. 
 No, you're right. Whatever...Stan is blowing up needs you more than I do. 
 You sure? 
 I'll be fine. Seriously. 
 Hey. 
 I know that look. 
 Oh, you know all my looks. 
 So why do you think Max is our guy? 
 He was a born analyst. He thrives on information. 
 You know what he asked me today? 
 What? 
 Nothing. Not a single question. 
 Even after I clearly came to him looking to discuss an active case. 
 It's hard to believe he could accomplish something like this from solitary confinement. 
 Nicholson did a decade ago. 
 Max is that kind of analyst-- brilliant and wily as hell. 
 I bet he savors the challenge. 
 Max Langford was a dark chapter for our agency. 
 Three operatives killed, an entire department compromised. 
 Took us years to recover. 
 I understand the DCI's concern. 
 Completely. 
 And his need to loop you in. 
 What do you mean? 
 I mean, if this thing goes sideways, who better to point a finger at then somebody who not only knew Langford but knew the players and knows where the bodies are? 
 Let 'em point. 
 I'm stopping this b*st*rd here and now. 
 Working theory. 
 Max Langford has established and is maintaining an intel ring from prison. 
 We believe this ring may have been responsible for the death of an asset in Moscow yesterday. 
 We mean to discover his methods and shut it down. 
 Every aspect of Max's life-- his past, his present-- will be dissected and examined. 
 Everyone he knows--his lawyers, his family, his friends. 
 No stone unturned. Auggie? 
 Max has two daughters. 
 The older sister Bebe owns a gift shop in Alexandria. 
 Despite being only two hours away, she's never visited her father in prison. 
 Our leading candidate is Max's other daughter Grace. 
 Grace moved to work at a horse farm near Petersburg so she could be closer to her dad. 
 Grace and Max's lawyer are the only two people who have visited him in prison. 
 Grace visits him every week and she's our likely target. 
 Jillian, you take Bebe. 
 Annie, I want you on Grace. 
 Collins, you're with me. 
 We'll liaise with legal about Max's lawyer. 
 Everybody else, let's get to work. 
 Just think, you could be gutting it out at mile 21 right now. 
 Which Danielle is doing without me. 
 Her and 20,000 strangers. 
 I gotta tell you, Auggie, this job is not great for sisterly bonding. 
 I am trying to do damage control, and I feel like all I ever do is apologize. 
 Giver her some credit. She knows you're trying. 
 You think? 
 I do. 
 And you are. 
 Now, attention, class. Today's lesson--horses. 
 What about them? 
 Your target's a veterinarian. 
 Grace works at a facility that breeds and cares for race horses. 
 Your cover is a journalist. 
 Breeder's Magazine.  No joke. 
 Here are some back issues. I read it for the articles. 
 You should've pulled Danielle out of the marathon. 
 She's the real horse buff of this family. 
 But you're the better operative, and from what I hear, you've gotten a few ribbons yourself. 
 It's in your file. I know it's creepy. 
 You know what's creepy? 
 I'm getting used to the creepiness. 
 A good reporter needs three things. 
 A mini recorder, a reporter's tablet, and the truth. 
 Thanks, Professor. 
 There will be a quiz later. 
 Good morning, Emily. 
 Good morning! 
 I was told to tell you that the Langford mission is a DPD assignment. 
 Langford mission? 
 I didn't even know that was in play. 
 Fine. Um... 
 Keep my Asian Humint debrief. Don't cancel it. 
 Actually, they called. They wanna reschedule. 
 To when? 
 They said they'd get back to us. 
 Okay. Thank you. 
 [Dog barking] 
 [Horse whinnying] 
 Excuse me. I'm looking for Grace. 
 Do you know where she is? 
 Thanks. 
 [Horse whinnying] 
 You're a reporter. 
 That's right. 
 Annie Walker. It's a pleasure to meet you. 
 I'm afraid you came a long way for nothing, Ms. Walker. 
 I don't talk to the press. 
 You don't? Why's that? 
 I'm gonna have to ask you to leave. 
 Does your employer know about this? 
 Wouldn't he consider an article about your care and treatment of his retired race animals beneficial to his business? 
 Frankly, my editor and I really admire your stand, and we'd like to help you make your case... 
 If you'd let us. 
 Oh. I thought you were interested in something else. 
 I get a lot of visits from the press. 
 What else are they interested in? 
 Nothing. 
 I usually have to say something before somebody asks me to leave. 
 Um, is this a bad time? 
 Actually, it is. 
 If I'd known-- I have an existing appointment. 
 That's okay. Could we reschedule? 
 I have a demanding editor and a deadline. 
 Who are you with again? 
 Breeder's Magazine. 
 Ah. Studs-R-Us. 
 We prefer Studs Monthly. 
 Uh, how about tomorrow? Say 11:00? 
 That'd be great. 
 [Cell phone rings] 
 Hi. 
 What are those famous Walker instincts telling you? 
 I got a good vibe, basically, if a brief one. 
 She couldn't talk. So I'm gonna see her tomorrow. 
 I don't know, underneath it all, she seemed kinda fragile. 
 She couldn't talk. 
 Why? 
 I don't know. But I'm about to find out. 
 I'm following her. 
 You need assistance? 
 I can get a team there. 
 No. I'm good. 
 She doesn't have any idea. 
 [Chuckles] 
 Or doesn't seem to care. 
 Or she's very good. 
 I have to get back to you, Auggie. 
 Adnan Al-Raheeb. A Saudi with a history. 
 Arms dealing most significantly, but not exclusively. 
 Could you overhear their conversation? 
 No, I was too far away. 
 His weapons customers include FSB's Spetsnaz force. 
 There's our Russian connection. 
 Good work, Annie. 
 It looks like we might've found our traitor. 
 We've pored over all the transcripts and recordings of Grace's prison visits with her father, and discovered the probable means of conveying information. 
 Chess. Barber. Okay. 
 Langford and Grace are playing a long-term game of chess, that's one move per visit. 
 So at the end of every visit, he'll say something like "Knight to Rook four." 
 He's allowed a chess board in his cell? 
 No, we're assuming he's keeping the entire board in his head. 
 Not easy, but he was a brilliant analyst. 
 Yeah, this is definitely code. 
 I mean, the only problem is there are hundreds of thousands of possible moves on a chess board. 
 This is chess, okay, not checkers. 
 So each piece could be representative of different variables. 
 We need to gain access to Grace's house to try to search for a key or a cipher. 
 And because you have the relationship with Grace, you're gonna be in charge of distracting her and keeping her out while the tech team scours her house. 
 A lot of five-year-olds are just as fast as a stake horse. 
 But for the racing world, fate has passed them by. 
 I'm ashamed to admit it, considering I'm supposed to be an expert, but even though I've been around horses my entire life I've never ridden a thoroughbred. 
 Until today. 
 Come on. 
 [Device buzzing] 
 See what I mean? 
 I get it now. 
 As much fun as this is for you, it's even more fun for the horses. 
 That horse your riding on? 
 He fractured his leg at Pimlico. 
 A lot of folks said it wasn't worth the money or effort to try to heal him. 
 But I believe rehabilitation is always possible... 
 And worth it. 
 We should probably start heading back. 
 We don't have to go on my account. 
 I'd love to stay out too, but we need to get the horses back to be fed. 
 Come on, we'll really open it up on the way home. 
 Okay. 
 Let's go! 
 [Cell phone buzzing] 
 [Whispering] Incoming. 
 Incoming, guys. Wrap it up. 
 We gotta go out the other door. Out the other door. 
 Thanks. 
 Thanks so much. That was really fun. 
 Anytime. 
 Wow. It's a little stuffy in here. 
 So do you have to run right now, or would you like a glass of wine? 
 Thanks, I'd love a glass. 
 Finally. 
 [Phone ringing] 
 Talk to me, Barber. 
 We got outta there in the Nick of time, man. 
 It was close. 
 You always say it was close. Is it ever not close? 
 Seriously, this time was ridiculous. 
 And the intel? Anything promising? 
 Well, no key or cipher. 
 We got plenty of pics to drill down. 
 Good work, Barber. See you soon. 
 Got a minute, Auggie? 
 Jai, is that you? 
 No fragrance today? 
 You wanna grab a beer after work? 
 Yeah, sure. Allen's tavern? 
 Let's class it up a bit. W hotel bar? 
 I'll bring my evening cane. 
 So...I've been thinking about it, and I owe you a bit of an apology for the way I acted yesterday. 
 What do you mean? 
 Well, when you approached and said you were a reporter, I assumed you wanted to talk about my father. 
 Your father? 
 He was a CIA operative. 
 And he got caught up in a scandal. 
 What kinda scandal? 
 Um...He allegedly... sold secrets to the Russians. 
 And now he's in prison for it. 
 The whole thing is kinda murky and, well, you know the CIA. 
 What do you mean? 
 Well, they're not exactly a paragon of morals or ethics. 
 Maybe he was set up. 
 Um...Do you see him? 
 What's your relationship? 
 Good. 
 I do see him. 
 You can't believe everything you read in the papers. 
 Meaning? 
 Meaning at the end of the day, I believe he's still a patriot. 
 A lot of the things he was convicted of... 
 Anyway, it's complicated. 
 I have a complicated relationship with my dad too. 
 Because of things he did? 
 Decisions he made? 
 Yeah. 
 This is lovely. 
 Oh, yes. 
 But the allegory is kinda sad. 
 My dad and I are playing a game. 
 At each visit, I give him one move. 
 At the next, he gives me his. 
 How does that work? 
 Slowly. 
 Bebe! 
 Oh...My God. Did you carry that all the way from Mexico? 
 For my little sister, absolutely. 
 Aww. 
 I missed you. 
 So how was your trip? 
 Hot, incredibly. 
 Anyway, this supposedly signifies the seven deadly sins. 
 I didn't completely get it, but apparently the town is famous for these and I thought you'd like it. 
 I love it. 
 Hi. Do I know you? 
 Uh, no. Hi. I'm Annie. 
 Annie is a reporter. This is my sister Bebe. 
 A reporter. Grace...I mean, really? 
 Annie is doing an article on horse farms. 
 Horse farms. 
 Well, anyway-- 
 You've had a long trip. 
 Do you happen to have my mail by any chance? 
 Oh, yeah. 
 [Cell phone ringing] 
 Oh. 
 Sorry, I have to take this. Hello? 
 Yes, I can hold. Here you go. 
 Thanks. 
 Good evening, Mr. Al-Raheeb. 
 Thank you for getting back to me. 
 What magazine did you say that you work for? 
 Hmm? 
 Your article on horse farms. 
 Oh, uh, it's for  Breeder's Magazine. 
 What was your last name again? 
 'Cause I just wanna pull up the masthead. 
 Walker. 
 Annie Walker. 
 But I'm writing this as a freelancer. 
 Grace is a very trusting soul. 
 [Scoffs] Much more trusting than me. 
 You know, I mean, even after everything that our father's done to us, she just won't turn her back on him. 
 She can't. She sees the good in people. 
 No matter what. 
 I can understand that. 
 If you're misrepresenting yourself to her or you have some kind of agenda to get some scoop on our father, I'm asking you now nicely to stop. 
 Um, I can assure you you have nothing to worry about. 
 I hope not. 
 I'm sorry about that. Business. 
 No, that's fine. I should get going anyway. 
 It's a long drive. 
 Well, let me walk you out then. 
 Okay, great. 
 Call me if you have any more questions. 
 Thank you. 
 We should do this again sometime. 
 I'd like that. 
 Bebe definitely photographed the chess board. 
 We've got techint data-mining e-communications out of Virginia now. 
 I don't know how complicit Grace even is. 
 Maybe not at all. 
 Well, we are in agreement there. 
 The file that Grace exchanged with Al-Raheeb was a job offer. 
 Al-Raheeb is trying to poach Grace away from Willow Stream Farm in order to take care of his own stables. 
 This is a copy of the file. How'd we get this? 
 Gotta love Saudi Arabian intelligence. 
 They're not big on the whole privacy laws thing. 
 So what's the play? 
 We want you to turn Grace against Bebe. 
 We feel fracturing the sisters is the best way to do it. 
 And psych ops agrees. 
 Psych ops? 
 We had a psychological profile drawn up on both of the sisters. 
 Bebe's motivations are clear-- financial need. 
 Her gift shop isn't doing so well since the economic downturn, and she has parental issues that Freud could write a whole new book about. 
 Bebe and Grace are really close. 
 I know, that's the point. That's the key. 
 These prison records show that Bebe visited her father weekly and she was lying to Grace. 
 You need to show those to Grace in order to turn her. 
 I don't understand. I th-- 
 Annie, prison records are fake. 
 We need to drive a wedge between the sisters and this is the best way to do it. 
 Really? 
 Forging prison records is our only option? 
 I don't think that's gonna hold up. 
 It will if you sell it right. 
 They're sisters. 
 Grace will see right through this. 
 Well, if you have a better tactic, please speak up. 
 Joan, I don't think I can do this. 
 You think your own situation with your sister is clouding your judgment? 
 I think my own situation is clarifying my judgment. 
 Annie, I have three sisters. 
 You don't own a monopoly on sibling drama. 
 Every family, every situation is different. 
 So you need to put that sense of moral outrage in check, because this is real. 
 Real lives are at stake. 
 This is what we do. 
 I think my emotions will impair my ability to do this mission well. 
 So I'm not doing it. 
 
 
 
 Hey! 
 It's late. What are you doing here? 
 Did you finish the race? 
 Yes. 
 It was exhilarating. 
 I've never done anything like that. 
 And I never will again. 
 I'm so sore. 
 Aw. 
 Poor baby. I won't give you a hug. 
 Oh, you're the best! 
 Can you get the thing with the thingy? 
 Yeah. 
 Do you ever think about dad? 
 Is that why you're here? 
 Maybe. 
 I think about how he lied to us. 
 I think about how he lied to mom. 
 I thought about him when you lied to me. 
 Did you ever think there was another version of the story? 
 I mean, we only ever heard mom's side. 
 Oh, I don't know, you had a better relationship with him. 
 No, I did not. 
 You did. 
 Another question left to ponder. 
 I'm gonna go. 
 You have a husband and two kids to take care of. 
 A husband who's still at work and two kids who are asleep. 
 It's a moment of peace. 
 Enjoy it. 
 Ow. 
 Ugh. 
 Hey, Annie. 
 Yeah. 
 I'm glad we didn't have to do the whole apology thing again. 
 Me too. 
 There's a hot blonde at your 10:00 giving you the eye. 
 She must not be into Indian guys. 
 Alpha-male compliment-slash-dig aside, I'm taken. 
 Giving the other D.C. bachelors a fighting chance. 
 You didn't invite me down here to be your wingman. 
 What did I invite you down here for? 
 I don't know. 
 But we've never had drinks together, just you and me, ever. 
 So you must want something. 
 Okay. 
 I need advice. 
 Jai, I don't know why the blonde at 10:00 isn't into Indian guys. 
 Work advice. 
 You're the one with Langley dialed. 
 And you're the one with a connected father and a fat new office under the DCI. 
 What's it called again? 
 Office of special projects. 
 We interface amongst the various directorates and help exploit efficiency opportunities to minimize bureaucracy. 
 You lost me at interface. 
 Look, OSP has the opportunity to help the Agency reinvent itself post-UBL. 
 I have a budget, I have autonomy. 
 But I'm hemmed in. 
 I can't get any internal traction. 
 As big a budget as we have, the CIA is not a budget-driven agency, Jai. 
 It's a people-driven agency. 
 Doesn't matter how big your wallet is. 
 You need a few good hires to create a critical mass. 
 If you hire, they will come. 
 You interested? 
 Nice try. 
 Cheers. 
 Mind if I join you? 
 Hi, uh... Two more please. 
 And I'll start a tab. 
 Thanks. 
 I haven't been here in years. 
 Not since I was a field op. 
 Chili dog still good? 
 Surprisingly good actually. 
 You're not here to give me a pep talk, are you? 
 Here to tell me to do the job? 
 Yes, that's right. 
 Annie, I understand your sensitivity to this mission. 
 But due to Max Langford's recent actions, we've had to suspend all of our Moscow operations and we are flying blind in Russia right now. 
 I know you feel that your personal situation is getting in the way of your ability. 
 But it's that sensitivity that makes you the exact right person for the job. 
 That's why I picked you. And I think you know that. 
 Thanks. 
 However you wanna get the mission done is up to you. 
 But get the mission done. 
 I'll get it done. 
 Grace! 
 Oh, Annie! Hi! 
 Hey, come here. Here you go. 
 Hey, you have more questions? 
 Um... 
 I'm not a reporter. 
 I'm CIA. 
 Go away. 
 Your father is continuing to run an illicit spy ring from his prison cell. 
 What? How is that possible? 
 Your sister is passing along his chess moves to a foreign spy ring. 
 It's a sophisticated code. 
 My sister? 
 They're prison transcripts. 
 Conversations between Bebe and your father at the prison. 
 Bebe's been visiting my dad? 
 No. 
 She hasn't visited him once. They're fabricated. 
 I was asked by my superiors to trick you into believing that they were real so that you would turn on your sister, but I wanted to be honest with you so that you would help us. 
 Well, the CIA has a funny way of asking for help. 
 We have operatives in danger. 
 Because of my father. 
 Yes. 
 I don't believe you. 
 It's true. 
 And I think deep down, you know that. 
 I wanna see him. 
 Tell me everything. 
 What have they told you? 
 Now, if I've taught you one thing in this world, it's that there is more than one side to every story. 
 I know. 
 Yours, mine, and the truth. Which is it? 
 Just tell me what they told you, honey. 
 They told me people have died. 
 Trumped-up CIA dreck. 
 Now, even if it were true, it would only be bad people. 
 It'd just be a few less pawns on their chess board. 
 I'm not six years old. 
 I'm old enough to know that nothing's good or bad, black or white. 
 Well, the spy game is only black. 
 You're too good a person to understand that, Gracie. 
 And you're not? 
 I'm a spy. 
 I was recruited by the CIA because I'm smart and cunning and a fantastic liar. 
 You involved Bebe. 
 Your sister has always been wary of me ever since she was a little girl. 
 I was gone so often. 
 That's probably why she resents me. 
 So you put her at risk? 
 Bebe is not gonna do anything that I or anybody else asks her to do. 
 She's gonna make her own decisions. 
 You know that. 
 You're not telling me anything. 
 Consider the circumstances, honey. 
 Where we are. 
 Did you use me to pass along secrets? 
 You don't have anything to worry about, honey. 
 That's your concern? 
 What, my own daughter? 
 Of course. 
 That was our game, Dad. 
 For us. 
 It was supposed to be sacred. 
 I've spent the last... 15 years defending you. 
 Calling you misunderstood, telling people you were a hero. 
 But everyone else was right. 
 They all saw Max Langford. I saw my father. 
 And I'm a fool because of it. Gracie. 
 Grace? 
 Grace, I know how hard that must've been for you. 
 Do you? 
 How can you possibly know how difficult that was? 
 Why do you all say things you don't mean? 
 That wasn't my intention-- 
 I am done. 
 With this family, with the CIA, with you, with all of this! 
 Let me give you a ride home at least. 
 It's okay! 
 You were right. 
 I have no idea what you're going through. 
 My family, we have plenty of issues, but compared to you... I'm a lucky girl. 
 Your father talks about our assets like they are pawns on a chessboard. 
 Last week, Yuri Trubachev was killed. 
 Was he a good man? 
 I don't know. 
 But he has a wife named Masha who just beat breast cancer and a son named George who plays cello for the Moscow Philharmonic. 
 Your father says the spy world's all black. 
 I know you don't believe that because you can see the good in people no matter what. 
 I need your help. 
 If I were to help you, what would you need me to do? 
 Just contact your sister. 
 Tell her something is off with your father. 
 That he doesn't wanna play chess anymore. 
 Right. Bebe will act on that intel and hopefully, that will lead us to the spy she's in communication with. 
 They are the ones we're after ultimately. 
 But after Bebe does that, you're gonna have her arrested, aren't you? 
 Grace... 
 This is the right thing to do. 
 As hard as it is, I know you know that. 
 Okay. 
 Went to voicemail. 
 Okay. 
 Still a recording. 
 Leave a message. 
 Hey, it's me again. 
 Call me back when you get this, okay? 
 I know you don't care as much as I do, but dad just seemed really off when I saw him today. 
 Argumentative and forgetful. 
 Didn't even wanna continue our chess game. 
 He just said he forfeited, like he's giving up hope... or something, so call me, okay? 
 And don't forget, I'm making banana cream pie tonight. 
 Your favorite in case you wanted to come over for dinner. 
 How was that? 
 Fine. 
 You did good. 
 So what's next? 
 Now we wait for your sister to contact you. 
 I'm gonna go look after the horses. 
 I forgot to feed 'em earlier. 
 Keep an eye on the kettle, okay? 
 Sure. 
 What's your 20? 
 We're back at the house. 
 Any luck reaching Bebe? 
 Not yet, do we have any idea where she is? 
 No. I can tell you where she isn't. 
 She  isn't  at her apartment. 
 She's also not at the gift shop or within eyeshot of any of our surveillance teams. 
 I swear I might as well be out there looking for her myself. 
 Well, she's the daughter of a spy. 
 The apple doesn't fall far from the tree. 
 How's Grace holding up? 
 I don't know. 
 She says she wants to cooperate with us, and I believe her, but... 
 When push comes to shove, I don't know if she's gonna turn on her sister. 
 Well, we don't really have a backup plan here, Annie. 
 I mean, we could pick Bebe up and see if she'll talk. 
 But if she's smart-- 
 I know. 
 We don't have anything hard against her. 
 And her Russian contacts'll disappear. 
 We have to try and force her to make contact with her handlers again. 
 I get it, I just-- 
 I don't know how easy that's gonna be. 
 Yeah, well, we don't do easy. 
 All right, your backup's only ten minutes away. 
 They're gonna setup perimeter surveillance around the farm. 
 Signal me if there's a problem. 
 [Kettle whistling] 
 [Cell phone ringing] 
 [Catching breath] 
 Bebe, you scared me. 
 Your sister's out in the barn with the horses. 
 Let's dismiss with the acting class, okay? 
 Your phone, please? 
 Stop. 
 Toss it over. Slowly. 
 Now your car keys. 
 They're in my purse. 
 Any firearms? Weapons? 
 Bebe, I don't know what you mean. 
 Turn around! 
 What? 
 I said turn around! 
 Put your arms up. 
 My father always tried to explain to me why you CIA types didn't carry guns. 
 Just doesn't make sense to me. 
 I know your father got you into this, but there is a way out. 
 You don't have to go down with him. 
 What makes you think this is his idea? 
 Let's take a little walk. Go. 
 If you make any sudden moves, I will end this right now. 
 Bebe! What are you doing? 
 Move her car into the stables. 
 I want it out of sight. 
 You were not supposed to come here. 
 Didn't you understand my message? 
 Of course I did! Did she? 
 I'm guessing it had something to do with banana cream pie? 
 Yeah, she knows that I hate bananas, and I know that she hates baking. 
 You were supposed to get out of town, Bebe, before it's too late! 
 I'm not gonna leave my sister behind. 
 I have a plan. We're getting out of here. 
 Move! 
 What plan? 
 What are you gonna do with her? 
 Just move the car, Grace! 
 Keep walking. 
 The agency knows where I am. 
 Move! 
 I have backup on the way. 
 Yeah, yeah. CIA always has your back, right? 
 Just like they had my father's? 
 They destroyed this family! 
 Bebe, think what this will do to Grace. 
 You don't wanna do this to your sister. 
 Get back! 
 I know you don't. 
 Turn around! 
 I can help you. 
 It's not too late. Believe me. 
 Yeah, it is. 
 [Horse whinnying] 
 [Horse whinnying] 
 [Grunting] 
 Stop! 
 Grace... This isn't you. 
 Maybe it is. 
 Maybe I am just like the rest of my family. 
 You don't have to be. 
 Grace, the second you put down that gun, she's gonna have you arrested. 
 You're gonna live your life in prison just like dad. 
 You haven't done anything wrong yet. 
 She's lying. 
 She's been lying to you since she met you. 
 Why would you trust her on this? What about you? 
 You and dad have been lying to me for years. 
 We were protecting you. 
 Grace, I know how important family is. 
 Especially when it's all you have. 
 But sometimes, you have to be your own person. 
 You have to make your own fate. 
 Hey, has anyone seen Barber or Hollman? 
 They got reassigned. 
 Reassigned? Where? 
 Office of special projects. 
 What the hell, Jai? 
 When I said hire a few good operatives, I didn't mean poach mine. 
 I just made the offer. 
 They're the ones who accepted. 
 Seems like your beef's with them, not with me. 
 Is that the kinda political double speak that got you this promotion? 
 Auggie, you were half right. People matter. 
 So does money. 
 For Barber and Hollman, this is where the money is. 
 That's the last time I give you advice. 
 That's the last time I'll need it. 
 Bebe Langford's in FBI custody. 
 She's already talking. 
 Max was using chess moves as codes to transmit secrets which Bebe then sold to an FSB handler. 
 Bebe's given up the identity and location of the handler. 
 We've got a team who's bringing him in now. 
 Annie? 
 Joan, I've been in situations like that before, but yesterday, I felt the bullet go by me. 
 Decisions, reflexes, bravery-- none of that matters. 
 I feel like my luck's running out, so if I wanted specialized weapons training-- 
 Consider it approved. 
 You can report for shooter and bodyguard training on Monday morning. 
 [Sigh] 
 Thanks.
