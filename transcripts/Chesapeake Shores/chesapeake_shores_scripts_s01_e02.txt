 Previously on Chesapeake Shores. 
 You leaving us? 
 I'm sorry, I... 
 Your kids... are not okay, Dad. 
 I did what I had to do to take care of my family. 
 You're doing the same thing for your children. 
 Abby O'Brien, back in Chesapeake Shores. 
 I guess part of me always thought that you'd come find me. 
 How do you know I didn't? 
 Most of your children don't speak to their mother. 
 They resent you because you're the parent they were left with and you were gone more than you were home. 
 Is that...? 
 Mom? 
 [Laughing and bantering] 
 Definitely not. 
 That's what you always tell them but it's never like that. 
 Can you guys not complain? 
 Because no one offered to help me. 
 Yes I did, I did offer to help. 
 Did you? Did you really? 
 All right, we have hot dogs and buns... 
 Everything for S'mores... 
 Gran's always got us covered. 
 Hey, are we sure that Gran is okay? 
 Yeah, they said it was low blood sugar. 
 Something none of us need to worry about right now... 
 Okay, well here's to Gran. 
 Home from the hospital. 
 Cheers. 
 Get in here. 
 There we go! To Gran. 
 To Gran. 
 Speaking of, Bree says you're moving home? 
 No, no, no, just for the summer. 
 This weekend's enough for me. 
 Hey what are you gonna do after the bar? 
 I dunno, I might stay in New York. 
 I'm sorry, wait. 
 Connor, you live in New York? Because I never see you. 
 That's because my nose bleeds when I get too close to the upper East side. 
 So funny. 
 Pass the hot dogs, please? 
 What's with the P's and Q's Kev? 
 Two weeks pre-deployment at Fort Benning, ma'am. 
 Shooting star. 
 Falling star, what a sight to see Shooting star, shining star... grant a wish for me. 
 Awww! Gran taught us that. 
 No, Mom did. 
 No, Gran did. 
 No. 
 Where is Mom, anyway? 
 She's staying at the B&B. 
 Oh yeah, and you drew the short straw, so you two have to have a slumber party! 
 I was pretty stunned to see her walk out of that cab though. 
 Yeah. 
 Well obviously she's here to see her favorite! 
 He smiles. 
 When do you ship out? 
 Tomorrow night. 
 Yeah? Where to, Sergeant? 
 I'd like to tell you, but I'd have to kill you. 
 Ow! You're killing me right now. 
 [Cell phone ringing] 
 You're not at the office. 
 Okay no, not now. 
 Guys, I have clients that need to reach me at all times, that is why I'm good at my job. 
 Connor... Oh my god! 
 [Phone landing in the water] 
 What is wrong with you? 
 Connor... 
 I cannot believe you just did that! 
 That was not cool. 
 That was really mean. 
 It was a rock! 
 That was brutal. 
 I love it! 
 That was nice. 
 You deserve it. 
 Shh, hey, hey...

 Is this what you want, huh? 
 Come on, boy. 
 Go get it! 
 Come on boy! 
 You are nothing if not disciplined. 
 I need to get in at least 2-3 miles a day... 
 So, how was last night? 
 Uh, yeah. 
 Actually, my dad surprised us with a family reunion right there on the pier. 
 Bree and Connor and Kevin got a 24 hour leave. 
 He even invited my mom. 
 That doesn't sound like Mick. 
 You know, last spring, after I moved back here, one day your dad just knocked on my door and offered me a job. 
 What's strange about that? He probably needed some carpentry. 
 Your father barely said two words to me when we were growing up. 
 Now he's offering me a job? And how'd he know I needed work? 
 I don't know, did you? 
 Most of my money is tied up back in Nashville, so, a paycheck didn't hurt. 
 Point is, he knew enough to offer me a job, but he didn't think to let you know I was back in Chesapeake Shores? 
 Well, we all know my father works in mysterious ways. 
 Maybe he assumed if I knew you were back it would somehow be... 
 A distraction? 
 A complication. 
 Well, Mick knows best. 
 Like I said, my dad is full of surprises. 
 None of us knew what he had planned and yet, last night, there we all were. 
 The O'Brien family, together again. 
 Speaking of which, I should get going. 
 I don't want to be late for breakfast. 
 So is it? 
 A complication? 
 In a good way.

 Nana says not to climb on the counter. 
 Well don't tell her and she won't know. 
 Nana knows everything... 
 Carrie, you be a dear and you help Nana. 
 You and your sister take these napkins and put them on the table, please? 
 Okay. 
 Thank you. 
 And this napkin is for your croissants. 
 Thank you. 
 What in the world happened to your socks? 
 They're an old pair. I haven't had time for laundry. 
 From now on, I know you're busy with your B&B, you just bring your laundry to your nana, you hear me? 
 You still planning on opening in September? 
 This week. 
 You wanna open this week? 
 Jess, there's no way that's gonna happen. 
 Well, I'm missing the summer season. 
 Well yeah, but that's just bad planning. 
 I'm trying to help, but there's a lot more that needs to be done over there. 
 Good morning darling. 
 I cannot handle them. 
 Who? 
 Mom and Dad. 
 I had to sneak out past Mom this morning and now Dad's on my case. 
 Okay, well you could stop avoiding Mom. 
 And as for Dad... 
 He can't tell me what to do. 
 Right! You're an adult. 
 You can do whatever you want, so do that. 
 Auntie Jess, Carrie says I can't help set the table. 
 What? 
 Obviously, she takes after Dad. 
 C'mon, let's set the table. 
 Is there coffee? 
 Good morning you! 
 Connor, did you go to Sally's? 
 Because Bree asked you to pick up donuts. 
 No, she didn't. 
 Yeah, I did. 
 Bree, you didn't. 
 Connor, I did. 
 You know what? After S'mores last night, nobody needs donuts. 
 The girls like them. 
 Okay, I will go to Sally's. 
 Let me. 
 The keys are on the hall counter. 
 Thank you. They'll be boxed and waiting for Connor. 
 Okay. 
 Morning. 
 Morning. 
 What are you doing? 
 You weren't gonna knock, were you? 
 Oh, just give your mother a hug. 
 You used to live here. 
 I know. 
 What is this around your tags? 
 Those are silencers. 
 So the tags don't jingle and make noise. 
 You mean you actually get close enough they can hear you? 
 Mom, I'm one of the guys helping the guys who get shot. 
 Go inside, I'll be right back. 
 (Flashback) I'm not leaving all of my friends because you're sick of fighting with dad. 
 We just can't make it work, your dad and I are just... 
 You're leaving us and you're moving like a million miles away? 
 (Carrie) You're doing the colors wrong! 
 (Caitlyn) No, I'm not! What is all this shouting? Mimi, Mimi! Yay, you're here! My favorite girlies! Oh, I missed you. What a welcome! I see you found the old place. Just followed the bread crumbs. Ugh... What now? She just strolls in like she never left. Jess, she is your mother. And no, you cannot skip breakfast. Can I skip the whole weekend? Okay! Why is this so hard for you? You've seen Mom before. She was at my wedding and graduations. Why's it hard for you to leave the table set the way the girls and I set it? Because you did it wrong. Hey guys... dad has some announcement. What? I don't know. Come on! Okay, good, I'm glad you're all here. I have decided to take the summer off. With Abby here, and Carrie and Caitlyn, and Jess trying to open the B&B, I want to be home. Mick, darling, I think it's wonderful. Wonderful! Yes? Bree O'Brien, maybe I can convince you to stick around. Oh, I think it would be a shame to miss another hot, humid summer in Chicago. It is cool here. I'll think about it. Yeah, you wouldn't want me around. Of course I would, Connor. I just figured that with you taking the bar, you'd want to buckle down. Right. Oh, by the way, I've got the back table at Sally's reserved for one o'clock. Big family lunch. It's going to be great. Actually, I was planning on taking these girls on your first mani-pedi today. [Excited clapping] Can't that wait? I've got a big surprise planned for them. We want to go with grandpa. We want the surprise. Okay yeah, we can do it another time. Okay, well, if we're gonna have lunch at one, I could stand to skip breakfast. I have work at the B&B. Jess, you really think you can have things ready by this weekend? Yeah, absolutely. In that case, I'll tell you what. I'll come over and we can keep working on the place, okay? Bye! Can we go outside? We're not hungry. All right. Actually, I am going to come with you. Mom, Dad? Hi, is Dr. Campbell in please? I'm sorry, he's out for the holiday. Is this an emergency? An emergency? No... no, however, I was calling to check on some test results. Would you like to leave a message? No, thank you... I'm fine. I'll call back. Thank you, bye. Morning! Good morning. I forgot how wonderful the view is out here. It hasn't changed in the 17 years since you've been gone. I can't get this blasted machine to start, but I will. How would you like a spin around the shores? I'd love it. Good! Now I'm gonna check the wires, I plugged her in last night and she's gonna start. Nell O'Brien, you are still a force of nature. [Laughing] I don't know... Tell me, are you feeling better? I'm fine, Megan, thank you. And now how about you? Nell, I just want to say thank you for being a daily part of my kid's lives. That's a grandmother's privilege. And for loving them so well. And that's my pleasure. I missed out on so much. I know that. But if it's any cold comfort, so has Mick. Why do you think the children reacted the way they did to his announcement? Because they've never seen their father take off eight minutes, let alone eight weeks. Mick... I missed you. I missed you too darling. So have your children. But I'm always gonna be here for you, you know that. And I, you. As long as the good lord when the breath goes out, lets it back in! All right, I'm going to get this thing started. Yes you will. Balloons! Big bunches. All shapes, every size. Wait, no. No balloons. Why not? Because they pop or get loose and then one kid starts crying, and then they all start crying. Okay, flowers? Yes! Big bunches. Different kinds in bright, bright colors. Actually wait... Allergies. One kid starts sneezing, and then they all start... Go ahead, make fun. You're spinning Jess, in circles. Even for you. Maybe Dad's right. Whose side are you on? Whoa, okay, this is not... Can we stop speed walking for a minute and breathe. Good. This isn't about sides. Okay? But maybe Dad knows a thing or two about... When I bought that place, I told him I'd open by September. It's July. Ahead of schedule is always better. Jess, are you sure this doesn't have anything to do with Mom? Staying busy so you don't have to deal? Hey, whoa! Whoa! Jess! I'm sorry, you can go. I am getting you a kid leash! All of you were older than me when Mom and Dad divorced. It's easier for you to navigate your relationships with them. Maybe, but I still have my issues, especially with Dad. Like? Haven't you ever noticed how he calls me by my first and last name? Bree O'Brien. Like he's always meeting me for the first time. Like I'm a stranger to him. So fun! Come here girlfriend! Thank you darling. Oh, there's the girls! Your Gran managed to fix that thing and zipped me all over the shore. It's just as beautiful as when... As when you left? Jess! As beautiful as I remember. That was awful. 
 
 Hi! Perfect timing. Doesn't look like perfect. I decided to treat myself to a mani-pedi, so... Mom, Mom! Mom, look! So precious! Look mom, look! I'm looking, I'm looking, and I can't believe my eyes. Grandpa, they already have bikes. Not here, but now they do. Every kid needs a bike in the summertime. Hey Jess, I stopped by the B&B to give you a hand, but you weren't there this morning. Thanks. Between Trace and the plumbing you did yesterday, I think everything's under control. I'm just trying to help. Mom? I think you parked your car in a handicap spot. I'm 76 years of age, I think that ought to count for something. I'll move it, Gran. Thank you Kevin. Oh my god, Connor! Fast as the day I bought it. What're you doing on that? I found it in the garage. I mean without a helmet. We don't want you winding up an organ donor. Everyone needs a bicycle in the summertime, right? All right, let's all go in. No, wait, wait, wait. We've gotta have one family photo. Mick, no! We haven't done one in awhile, we're doing a... No, no arguments, we haven't had one in forever. Sally, here. Please, take a family photo for us... Sure. Okay, so, here we go. Everybody line up. Kev, c'mon. I haven't seen this many O'Briens together in... Come on up. You leave tonight, so this will mark the occasion. Jess, get in here. Bree O'Brien? Come on, here we go. Come on. Come on, Bree. Everyone, try to squeeze in. Oh for goodness sake, we can't squeeze anymore. Squeeze! I need you to squeeze a little more. Okay, everyone say "Sally's!" Sally's! [Photo snap] Thank you, Sally. Painless, right? Thank you Sally, thanks so much. Let's have a look and see if we got anything decent. Here come look. That was a little tense. Just like old times. Oh, look... Yeah, that's the one. You going to be okay? Yeah, fine. Go ahead and I'll be right in. Okay. Hey girls, wait for Mimi! You still haven't explained to me what really happened back in Nashville. There's nothing more to say than what I already said. Drinking too much and sleeping too little? Why won't you open up? I'm not the only one here. I guess this is going to be more difficult than either of us would've imagined. I guess so... What about your music? It's there when I need it. Trace, music was everything to you. When I finally made it, after all those years of trying, it just wasn't what I thought it would be. Besides, there's a million ways I can earn a living. Like swinging a hammer for your father. Wait, so you're just going to walk away from your career? Your dreams? That's your plan? Life's what happens when you're busy making other plans, right? What about you? I remember you having a whole lot of dreams and making a whole lot of plans. Plans changed. My dreams had to be put on hold. I'm not in that position anymore. I have kids and a career and an ex-husband and... Abby. Forget about Wes and your career and your family just for a minute. Close your eyes. Close them! What do you want? What do you really want? In this moment? I don't know... Look at these China roses. And the peonies. They smell so good. I don't even remember this flower garden. Well, that's cause Gran planted it after you left. Umm, Jess begged Dad to sell seed packs for her fifth grade school project. But that was the year of Hurricane Dennis. So that became Jess's project. Gran planted every last seed. That's Gran. I am so thankful that your gran is okay. Yeah, me too. And I'm also thankful for the excuse for us to get together. Mmmm-hmmm. I know it's going to take time, honey. But I'd love to come to Chicago again. Ouch! Oooh, let's me look. I'm fine, it's fine. You're right. It's gonna take time. [Laughing] Your lemon squares bring me right back. Really! I sent you some last month. And like a total noob, I took them to study group. A noob? Never mind. But will you make some more? Of course. Yes! How's everything going? How's your studying going? It's a grind. I'm bored. It's been like that the entire third year. I recall your Uncle Thomas feeling the same way when he was in law school. To be honest, Gran... I don't even know what it's all about. I don't even know what kind of law I want to practice. This is the path that you've chosen and you need to walk it till the end. You take the bar and then you make your decision. Yes ma'am. Where's your cab? On its way. I thought everyone was asleep? Everyone is. What about you? Without sirens blaring and the roar of traffic and garbage trucks beeping as they back up, I just lay there thinking, it's too quiet. Something's wrong! I'd forgot how clear the sky gets at night on the Bay. My first night home, it was like someone switched the stars back on. Are you scared? To deploy again? Nah. Why not? Seriously? Seriously. About a week ago, I was baptized. Seriously? Seriously. Did you tell Dad? Dad? He's more of a concrete and steel guy. I don't know, maybe one day. So what? How did you... In the desert, when we make camp at night, we dig in. Like literally. We have these compact shovels and we hollow out a hole in the sand to sleep in. Maybe I should give that a try. It's actually not that bad. A few feet down, the sand is... it's cool and... you feel safe. I mean, it's lonely. But you're so dog-tired that doesn't matter. [Car pulling up] If something happens to me... Hey, nothing is going to happen to you. Abby, listen to me. This is important. Give me a hug you big slug. Just listen to me! One night, after our first drop in Afghanistan, we found ourselves in some heavy fire fight. It went on for three hours and there were a lot of casualties. Then after, I found myself laying in the sand, looking up at the stars, and... I don't want you guys to have to worry about me. Take care of yourself. Kevin... Give me a hug. Be safe. I love you. Morning. Morning. How did you sleep? Fine, thanks. I'll make coffee. What did you dream about? You used to ask me that... Every morning. I don't want you asking me about my dreams. I don't want you making my bed. You're here because Dad invited you and Abby suggested you stay with me. But I don't need a mother. You lost your chance when you walked out of my life. I'm sorry. I have to get ready for the opening. Jess... [Cell phone ringing] [Cell phone ringing] Hello? When? Well, what did they say? Did they say how long he'll be in surgery? All right... I'll wait to hear from you. Just call me as soon as you know anything. [Guitar smashing] [Anguished scream] Swish! All right, what do you want me to do now? Here. What do I do with this? Just drape it along the railing. Drape! No, Connor! Not right. I'd love for the girls to help. Mom and Dad took them to the beach. Should you've let them do that? They're the girls' grandparents. Mom and Dad... Spending time together. Why? Because they're gonna suddenly get remarried? Jess... I don't know. Sorry... How was the beach? I have a starfish. It's dead. Stop saying that. Okay, you two go inside and help Aunt Jess. Did you guys have fun? Oh, so much fun. Not too much fun though, right? Homemade? Your favorite... What did she mean by that? I have no idea. She's an O'Brien. I'd say she takes after you, but why pick a fight? Listen, you know yesterday in front of Sally's, I had one of those moments where I thought, I'm never going to get this right. I've been thinking a lot about Dad lately. Maybe it's because I'm turning 58. How old he was when he died. Two days ago, I stood in this house, the one he and I built 35 years ago, and I promised Jess that we would have time to work on it, together. It all goes by so fast. Hey Dad, the pipes in the kitchen and the pipes in the bathroom... there's water everywhere. Okay, I'll shut off the main valve. All right... hurry! Quicker, hurry up! I'm just stepping outside right now. You didn't say you were driving. It's four hours when you figure in all the nonsense at the airports. The girls love flying. Well, I'll serve them juice and little packs of peanuts. Where are they? They are inside watching the house flood like Chesapeake. It's a broken pipe. You're early and I was hoping that they could stay for some of the opening. It sounds like it'll get cancelled. Not with Mom and Dad to the rescue. Your mother's here? Yeah. When Gran went into the hospital, Dad called her and... forget it. Can we please talk about what is going on with the girls? What's going on? Well, you tell me. You say that you don't want to pay support. No, I didn't say that I don't want to pay support. You did. I said we could save a lot of money if they stay with me in Brooklyn during the week. So this is about money? Because I thought there was something going on with you and Gabrielle... No, nothing's going on. Well the girls overheard you two. I don't know what they think they heard. We've been over this. Well, let's go over it again, because I still don't know what you want. Why don't I go into town and get something to eat at Sarah's? Sally's. And you're more than welcome to have something here. I'm sure things are awkward enough. I'll be back in an hour. Come see us again when things aren't so damp. Jess, honey... I'll get someone here to replace the reduction valve. In the meantime, don't turn on too many taps, okay? Thank you. You might want to make an announcement to welcome everyone while there are people still here. Really? Testing? Hello? Testing? Umm... what a beautiful day in Chesapeake Shores. [Muted applause] I want to thank you all... each and every one of you, for coming to the opening of my Bed and Breakfast. I have poured my heart into creating a place where guests won't just feel welcome, they'll feel at home. [Applause] Oh, one more thing. I want to thank my family for always being there for me. Whether I like it or not. Thanks, have fun! I'm gonna write you something next time. Please do. This is a nice surprise. So, I've been thinking... There's no good reason why we shouldn't have kissed the other night. It made things unclear. Do you even know what makes you happy anymore? It's been 16 years and a lot's changed since we were together. Trace, please... And the last thing I did was go to New York, only to turn around when I found out you were getting married. I can't do this now... That's Wes. Great, I'll introduce myself. If we are ever gonna have another chance at this, at... us... I have to think about my children first. I know I ran off on you once, but trust me, please, I am not gonna do that again. Just please, do this at my pace. Let me see your pigtails one last time. Tell you what, I can't wait until you guys get back. And I'll see you in New York, right? You're early! I'm not early. You are, Wes. You said you were gonna be an hour. Can you not start with me, please? I don't want to do this. Go get the girls. Why are you being this way? I don't understand! What is going on with me? You know what? You're being crazy! I'm not being anything, you're the one who's... Hey... hey! Trace just don't, please? Daddy! Hey... Daddy, everything's wet inside. Aunt Jess' house is such a mess! Let's get home. C'mon sweetie. I'm gonna miss you so much! Can we listen to the radio? Let's tell stories. Well I bet we can do both. All right, I will see you girls later. I love you. I love you, Mom. My attorney wrote up... Attorney? To try and help us work this out. You and I need to work this out. When you're back in New York. Wes, you know that I'm spending the summer here with the girls. That isn't going to work, Abby. Wes? Wes? Wes! What're you doing? Wes! ♪ Maybe we'll come back someday to see how we've grown ♪ 
♪ Carve our names on everything return when we're old ♪
