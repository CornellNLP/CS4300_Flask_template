 Narrator: Previously on 
 Falling Skies... 
 I don't know what your alien friends did to you, but I for one do not want to find out. 
 We are fighting the same enemy. 
 If the rebellion isn't real, then nothing that's happened makes any sense. 
 If the Skitters are gonna overthrow their Masters... 
 Maybe it could be true. 
 Look, I don't know what you're plotting, but I'd rather swallow glass than be a part of it. 
 Charleston We've been promised paradise before There's no way to know for sure. 
 Who goes there? 
 Colonel Porter, First Continental Army. 
 Let's go to Charleston. 
 Porter: Can't tell you how proud I am of the way you guys kept the 2nd Mass in the fight. 
 Weaver: Last we heard, your unit was taking some pretty heavy fire. 
 Yeah, Mechs tore the hell out of us. 
 We put up a fight, but in the end, only five survived. 
 All we could do was patch up the wounded, bury the dead, and try to make our way down here. 
 Porter: We're basically in a defensive posture, just staying off the alien grid. 
 Weaver: How'd anyone even find this place? 
 Dumb luck. 
 This place was under construction when they hit the city. 
 Everything topside was destroyed. 
 Everything down below... survived. 
 [ Indistinct conversations ] 
 Oh, my God. 
 [ Conversations stop ] 
 Pope: What the hell they staring at? 
 [ Crowd cheering ] 
 Man: 2nd Mass, welcome! 
 Looks like your reputation precedes you, folks. 
 Welcome to Charleston. 
 [ Cheers and applause continue ] 
 Man: Happy to have you! 
 [ Indistinct conversations ] 
 Ham, sir? 
 Mm. Thanks. Looks good. 
 All right. Thanks. 
 Quite a spread. 
 Dad? 
 Dad! 
 Jeanne? 
 [ Laughing ] 
 Hey! Hey! 
 Oh, my goodness. 
 You're alive. 
 Yeah. 
 It's all right. It's all right. 
 Scouts said they found survivors from the 2nd Mass. 
 I was so scared that you wouldn't be with them. 
 You can't get rid of me that easy. 
 [ Laughs ] 
 Hey... 
 Hey, how'd you get here? 
 Where's your boyfriend? 
 He got all messed up when we left Richmond, Dad. 
 Don't disappear on me again, okay? 
 Okay. [ Laughs ] 
 [ Sniffles ] 
 Lyle: "Charleston Arbor." 
 Must have been building some kind of crazy underground mall. 
 They even rigged up some running water. 
 Pray to God that means showers. 
 You passed your sell-by date like 400 miles ago. 
 Yeah, well, so, how long do we wait till we put this, uh, hole in the rearview? 
 Trust me - have no intentions on making Mayberry my permanent residence. 
 Child: This way! 
 Matt: Look at all these kids. 
 Do you think that they have a school here, like we did before? 
 Be surprised if they didn't. 
 Go ahead. Check it out. 
 Just stay close, okay? 
 Okay. 
 Fresh bread, green beans, corn. 
 It's been a while since we could pick and choose, huh? 
 I see you passed on the Brussels sprouts. 
 And the spinach. 
 Like I said, it's been a while. 
 Tom Mason. 
 Boston College, Maloney Hall, second row, left, and always an aisle seat. 
 Just in case I had to sneak out early. 
 As I recall, you never dared. 
 Tom. 
 [ Laughs ] 
 Um, Anne, this is Arthur Manchester... 
 Hello. 
 ...chairman of B.C.'s American History Department back in the day. 
 And he's right - never missed a lecture. 
 I hope our people are treating you well. 
 To be honest, I'm overwhelmed. 
 Arthur also wrote 
 "From Darkness, Democracy," which is one of the best histories on the Revolutionary War. 
 Clearly, lessons you're putting into practice. 
 The new United States of America, in which you are... 
 Majority leader. 
 "President" felt presumptuous. 
 We're still very much a work in progress. 
 You know I've got a million questions. 
 And I'm eager to hear about your encounter with this Overlord creature. 
 But we're gonna have plenty of time to talk. 
 And I'm betting your people haven't seen a real bed in quite a while. 
 Or hot food, clean clothes. 
 Speaking of which, I had my son Matt make this up just in case. 
 This is the names of everybody in the 2nd Mass, along with their assignments. 
 I'll get our housing committee working on this right away. 
 Tom, I can't tell you how happy I am that you're here. 
 Charleston could use a man like you. 
 Man: Wait till that generator's working. 
 Porter: Gents, General Bressler. 
 General. 
 Captain Daniel Weaver, 2nd Massachusetts, reporting. 
 Gunnery Sergeant Aloysius Murphy, United States Marine Corps, sir. 
 At ease, gentlemen. 
 Porter's told me a lot about your unit. 
 Congratulations on making it through. 
 I'd say you've earned this. 
 Appreciate that, sir. 
 I had a quick look at your men, at your ordnance. 
 I'd say you've put together a hell of a fighting force. 
 We can always find a place for more, hmm? 
 If I may... 
 Go right ahead, Captain. 
 2nd Mass executed ambushes against the aliens in Connecticut, Richmond. 
 And we've been tracking enemy activity all the way down the line... here in Concord... even in Florence. 
 If you need our people to scout for you, just say the word. 
 Appreciate the intel, Captain, but we won't be needing your scouts. 
 Porter: General, these 2nd Mass people have got actionable intelligence. 
 Colonel Porter, your opinion is noted. 
 You're dismissed. 
 Yes, sir. 
 [ Door opens, closes ] 
 Let me, uh, lay it out for you. 
 The aliens have no reason to attack Charleston again. 
 As far as they know, the city's been neutralized. 
 Given that, our civilian authorities decided to use the lull to regroup and rebuild. 
 Until that changes, we're not in the business of picking fights. 
 The civilian leader Manchester -e calls the shots for the military, too? 
 As he'll be happy to remind you, he does have 230 years of American tradition on his side. 
 Manchester was one of the first settlers and wound up becoming their leader by default. 
 But as our numbers grew, he made sure his people knew who to thank for their three squares a day, full bellies. 
 It made him very popular. 
 Hal: Captain Weaver! 
 Captain, you better get out here. 
 [ Indistinct shouting ] 
 Calm down! Nothing's been decided yet! 
 Damn it, I am ordering you to step back and allow us to continue. 
 I don't take your orders, Sergeant. 
 And I'm not letting you split these people up or disarm them without a reason! 
 What the hell is going on here? 
 Captain, they're spreading the 2nd Mass out across a dozen different housing areas. 
 This is not a damn resort! You will go where you are told! 
 You better back off! 
 At ease! At ease, Sergeant Clemons. 
 Jim? 
 These people have had each other's backs for months. 
 I understand that. 
 And you've got to understand this isn't punitive. 
 Down here, we store all the weapons in a central area, and then we issue them according to mission. 
 We're just salting your people in where they belong. 
 Now, that said, you tell me "no way," 
 I'll back your position. 
 [ Indistinct shouting ] 
 Hold on! 
 [ Shouting stops ] 
 I may not like it, but the Colonel is making sense. 
 We're here now. 
 We're in Charleston. 
 We're in Charleston. 
 Tom. 
 No, Captain Weaver's right. 
 We need to start thinking beyond the 2nd Mass now. 
 Good. 
 Carry on, Sergeant Clemons. 
 Clemons: Yes, sir. 
 [ Pounding on door ] 
 It's  the South Carolina Gazette. 
 You're kidding. 
 And an invitation. 
 Arthur wants to see me first thing. 
 [ Sighs ] 
 So much for sleeping in. 
 I'm assigned to the medical clinic with Lourdes. 
 Look at us -- commuters on our way to the office. 
 If I had a pot, I'd make us some coffee. 
 If I had a cup, I'd drink it. 
 [ Chuckles ] 
 [ Knock on door ] 
 Manchester: Tom. Come in. 
 [ Door closes ] 
 Hmm. 
 Go ahead. Take one. 
 They look delicious. 
 You grew these here? 
 First crop from our hydroponic garden. 
 [ Sniffs ] 
 Another baby step toward self-sufficiency. 
 So, tell me -- what do you think of Charleston so far? 
 I think if you'd asked me that question three days ago, I never would have believed a place like this was even possible. 
 It's a new beginning, Tom -rom the ground up, and that includes forming a true government. 
 So I heard from your pilot -- Avery. 
 Hell of a woman. 
 Your book -- 
 "From Darkness, Democracy." 
 Go ahead. You can keep that. 
 Our founding fathers had remarkable foresight, but not even  they  could have imagined an alien attack. 
 We're going to need a political system designed for a post-invasion world, Tom. 
 We could be like Washington and Jefferson, founders of a new democracy. 
 I have to admit -he historian in me is intrigued. 
 I'm happy to hear it, because you come at a critical moment. 
 There's a confidence vote scheduled for tomorrow - referendum on my leadership. 
 It's pro forma, really - chance for the settlers to blow off some steam. 
 I can't imagine you would have a problem. 
 But I could always use another arrow in my quiver. 
 I'm hoping you would stand with me. 
 I'd be honored, Arthur. 
 I'll be there, of course. 
 Although, I think you may want to reconsider after you hear what I have to tell you. 
 Now  I'm  intrigued. 
 May I? 
 Please. 
 We've had several encounters with the aliens over the last few weeks. 
 And I know it's hard to believe, but we think... that a group of them have turned against the Overlords. 
 "Turned," meaning... 
 Meaning that the Skitters were enslaved, just like our harnessed kids, and that a few of them want to fight back just as much  we  do. 
 Well, so far, this sounds like good news. 
 All we have to do is stand back and let the bastards kill each other off. 
 Or we can ally with the rebel Skitters and hit the Overlords with everything we got. 
 [ Laughs ] 
 You're serious? 
 Mm-hmm. 
 Trust the Skitters? 
 If I hadn't lived through the last couple weeks, I would be just as skeptical. 
 It's one of the reasons we wanted to keep this quiet until we had a chance to talk. 
 Well, I appreciate the discretion, Tom, because even a hint of this, and we would be facing a panic. 
 And with this vote -- 
 Arthur, I'm talking about the possibility of turning this war around. 
 And I'm telling you, Tom, not to say another word. 
 Your friendship means a lot to me, Tom, but I will  not jeopardize this city --  not even for you. 
 Jeanne. 
 Got a minute? 
 Well, kind of ironic, huh? 
 [ Both laugh ] 
 I remember when trying to get you to help with dinner was like pulling teeth. 
 [ Laughs ] 
 Be right back. 
 Man: Okay, Jeanne. 
 Dad, the way you're limping -t's from that fight, isn't it? 
 Ah, it's nothing. 
 You were hurt trying to help me. I just left you there. 
 You never left me. I always had you  here. 
 Just the thought of seeing you again, it kept me going. 
 I'm so sorry, Dad. 
 It's okay. 
 Just promise me we're gonna stay together. 
 Jeanne, I know it's hard, but I need you to tell me what happened with Diego and the others. 
 Skitter patrol spotted us a couple days after we left. 
 They came in force one night, and we had to scatter. 
 By morning, the Skitters moved on, but... 
 Diego and the rest never made the rendezvous. 
 I waited as long as I could, and then I rode here. 
 I'm sorry. 
 I know how much he meant to you. 
 Now I wish that I'd given him more of a chance. 
 Diego and the others could still be out there -ost or wounded. 
 I begged them to send a patrol. 
 Manchester wouldn't even consider it. 
 I can't let it go, Dad. 
 I have to say something in tomorrow night's meeting. 
 Then you say it. 
 And I'll be there for you. 
 Okay. 
 I promise. 
 I have to get back. 
 All right, well, I-I'll see you later? 
 Yeah. 
 [ Man coughing ] 
 Lourdes: Anne. 
 Hey. 
 Hey. You're here early. 
 Yeah, I just wanted to get started. 
 Helps to stay busy, you know? 
 Mm-hmm. 
 You want me to show you around? 
 I'd love it. 
 Come on. 
 Um...there's medicine over here. 
 Amoxicillin, erythromycin... 
 They're well-stocked. 
 They know I was pre-med, so I've been assigned to the surgical unit. 
 A chance to learn and -- 
 Man: Excuse me. 
 Are you the new doctor everyone's been talking about? 
 I guess I am. 
 Anne Glass. 
 Thank God. 
 If I have to wipe one more snotty nose... 
 Okay, over here is pediatrics. We've got -- 
 [ chuckles ] 
 I mean,  you've  got two flus, a tonsillitis, and a killer case of head lice. 
 You're leaving? Just like that? 
 You're a pediatrician. I'm a heart specialist. 
 Do the math. 
 Hold on. 
 I'm the combat medic from the 2nd Mass, who's gonna have you walking bow-legged unless you talk me through each patient's chart. 
 All right. Whatever you say. 
 So much for professional courtesy. 
 Once they find out about your experience in the field, they'll probably have you running the place. 
 I'm fine. 
 Whatever I can do to help. 
 [ Indistinct conversations ] 
 I'm glad I found you. 
 Hey. 
 It's been quite a first day. 
 What's this? 
 Bounty from Manchester's garden. 
 Enjoy it. I don't think I'm gonna be getting any more. 
 Skitter rebellion didn't sit well? 
 I'm surprised that I didn't get thrown out of his quarters. 
 Looks like they're skipping the Brussels sprouts just for you. 
 And everything else, for that matter. 
 Hello, Jeanne. 
 Wouldn't expect last night's spread. 
 Manchester's executive menu as a special 
 "Welcome to Charleston" gift. 
 Don't think everyone rates their own private quarters. 
 Most of us are sleeping 10 to a cubicle. 
 Well, we didn't ask for special treatment. 
 You didn't have to. 
 I'm sorry. 
 [ Chuckles ] 
 It's not you. It's this place. 
 Be careful. 
 Say the wrong thing, and you're pulling double shifts or worse. 
 Anne: I know this sounds petty, but there's something off here. 
 You mean like how they've assigned an experienced combat surgeon to pediatrics? 
 I'm not saying it isn't important. 
 With the 2nd Mass, I was doing vital medicine, saving lives. 
 Suddenly, I'm back to passing out aspirin now? 
 Taking temperatures? 
 I tell you -t  is  strange... how casual everybody behaves. 
 It's almost as if they really believe the aliens have disappeared. 
 I used to ache for that sense of complacency. 
 Now it almost scares me. 
 [ Muffled ] I agree. 
 [ Indistinct conversations ] 
 You're not gonna believe their artillery. 
 AT4s, GAU-17 minigun, heavy mortars. 
 We're talking serious alien stir-fry. 
 Pope: Yeah, assuming they ever take it out of storage. 
 Look, remember, we're just here to get a lay of the land, grab whatever the hell we can carry, and get the hell out of here. 
 Clemons: You! 
 So-called Berserkers, fall in. 
 [ Groaning ] Oh, no. 
 What the hell is this? 
 Did I say to talk? 
 I'm sorry. Did I say "kiss my ass"? 
 You kidding? 
 You must be Pope, right? 
 I understand you think that you're smarter, faster, and tougher than just about any man in this outfit. 
 You catch on quick. 
 Tec, you just gonna stand there in your new jammies, sucking your thumb or what? 
 Name's Gunnery Sergeant Murphy, Pope. 
 Now fall the hell in. 
 I think you and I are gonna have a lot of fun together. 
 Grab some iron. 
 Let's see if you Massachusetts crybabies know how to shoot. 
 Hmm? 
 [ Engine turns over ] 
 Man: Detail, halt! 
 Detail, hut one! 
 All right. Done and done. 
 I'll go grab a sandwich while you guys catch up. 
 Hal, lock it up and get over here. 
 Captain. You all right? 
 Damn A.C.U.s itch like hell. 
 What are you doing? 
 We're barely here, and you're popping off. 
 What are we doing, Captain? 
 We got target practice and close-order drills while the things are still out there. 
 That's the point -orter tells me that most of these boys have never fired a shot in combat. 
 That supposed to make me feel better? 
 Hell no! 
 But, chances are, you are gonna be leading some of them into battle. 
 They're gonna be scared as hell. 
 You got to teach them to conquer that fear. 
 The only way you're gonna do that is if you have their respect. 
 I hear you. 
 Good. 
 Now you get back to tearing down that weapon till you're seeing it in your dreams, understood? 
 Yes, sir. 
 Can I see your paperwork? 
 
 
 
 Matt, what happened? 
 I hate school. I hate it here. 
 I wish we'd never come. 
 I thought you were enjoying class. 
 There. All fixed up. 
 He'll be fine. 
 Come on, Matt. Talk to me. What happened? 
 I was in class when one of the bigger kids started talking trash about us. 
 I'm guessing it was nothing good? 
 He said he thinks the 2nd Mass -e never fought the aliens, that we're just cowards who came here to steal from them. 
 He said that you made a deal with the aliens when they took you away... 
 ...so that they'd leave us alone. 
 Oh. 
 Well... you know he's wrong. 
 Then why'd the rest of them act like he was right? 
 I don't know. 
 So, this boy took a swing at you? 
 Mm. 
 Well...No. 
 I  hit  him. 
 I think I might have broke his tooth. 
 Anne: I heard the shouting. Then I pulled Matt out of there. 
 He's been suspended for a week. 
 [ Sighs ] 
 Dad, I don't ever want to go back. 
 Well, it's probably better if you stay close to home for a while, anyway. 
 [ Metal clanks ] 
 We've got five minutes before the sentries come. Hurry up. 
 Sweet. 
 Maggie: Hold it right there. 
 I swear I didn't hear a thing. 
 Put it back, Lyle. 
 Pope: Maggie, Maggie, Maggie. 
 2nd Mass was welcomed by these people. 
 I'm not gonna let an ape like you ruin that. 
 Close it up, back off, and we'll pretend this never happened. 
 Clemons: Nobody move! 
 Don't shoot. I said, don't move. 
 Pope: No! 
 Crazy Lee: Lyle! 
 Man: Robo team, on me! 
 Crazy Lee: You shot him! 
 You're lucky his aim was off. 
 I would have put it between his eyes. 
 You shot him! You son of a bitch! 
 Put them in lockdown. 
 Man: Yes, sir. 
 Take the bleeder to medical. 
 This isn't what you think. 
 [ Lyle groaning ] 
 Told you we'd have some fun. 
 I'm gonna wish you into the cornfield. 
 [ Grunts ] 
 Arthur We need to talk. 
 If it's about the incident last night, that's Bressler's call. 
 It's about the incident. 
 A man got shot, and you've got three people in lockup. 
 It's a military matter, Tom. 
 Military defers to  you. 
 Damn it, Maggie was trying to stop them. 
 And the Berserkers -hey're out of their mind, but you're gonna want that kind of crazy if there's an attack. 
 What do you suggest? 
 Let Maggie walk. 
 And this Pope and the rest? 
 Punish them. Put them on crap details. 
 I don't really care. 
 We don't have enough people to lose four more. 
 Look, Tom, I get it. I really do. 
 But you need to see this from  my  perspective, okay? 
 I'm listening. 
 Bressler has been pounding the war drum to take a more aggressive posture toward the aliens. 
 Okay. 
 Built his army, and now he wants to pull the trigger. 
 But he's right about wanting to get into the fight. 
 It's the only way we're gonna beat them. 
 I understand that, of course. 
 I hope so, Arthur, because as comfortable as this all is, nobody's really safe until the aliens are gone. 
 It's just not the time. 
 It's taken months, but we've created the first city-state in the new America, and I want to nurture it. 
 I want to turn it into something greater. 
 But I can't do it if I don't have the authority. 
 I can't afford to look weak -ot now. 
 And doing nothing -ow does  that  look? 
 [ Sighs ] 
 Look, just help me get through this vote tonight, and I will look into clemency, we'll discuss Bressler, and then together, we'll start to build this new government. 
 Hey. 
 Mind if I get a minute to talk with Maggie? 
 Yeah. 
 Thanks. 
 My dad's talking to Manchester. 
 We're not gonna let this lie. 
 Well, since your pop's calling in favors, maybe he can, uh, put in a good word for the rest of the rabble. 
 Well, this is because of you, Pope, so you're lucky you're not in front of a firing squad. 
 Yeah, well, at least they'd be using those guns for something useful. 
 I don't care what Manchester says, I'm getting you out of here. 
 You do what you're thinking, you're gonna get us all killed. 
 I'm not asking for any favors. 
 Damn it, Maggie. 
 Is this because of what happened on the road? 
 Because if it is, I'm good with it, all right? 
 Just like that? 
 Just like that. How else should it be? 
 For God's sake, Hal, I told you that I had a kid in prison. 
 You should have freaked out and told me I was the worst person in the world. 
 Is that what you wanted? 
 What I expected was the courtesy of an honest emotional reaction. 
 Instead, I got 
 "I'm gonna think about it" and teenage silences. 
 Maggie -- 
 I can't deal with that, all right? I won't. 
 Maggie. 
 I'm sorry. 
 Look, you did your good deed. Now just leave me alone. 
 [ Fence rattles ] 
 Go! 
 So, as grateful as I am, I can't help thinking about the world around us. 
 I have friends still out there -aybe lost or sick. 
 And we're not doing anything about it, except waiting, hiding... hoping the aliens will go away. 
 I don't think that makes you a bad man, Dr. Manchester. 
 But I do think you're wrong. 
 [ Inhales deeply ] 
 That's -hat's all I have to say. 
 [ Applause ] 
 You did good. 
 I would like to thank all the speakers for their passion and commitment. 
 Before I begin, I would like to introduce an old friend -y former student and the hero of the 2nd Mass, Tom Mason. 
 Tom. 
 [ Crowd cheering ] 
 Thank you for welcoming the 2nd Mass into your home. 
 Man: Yeah! 
 And congratulations on taking back a city the aliens left in ruins and turning it into a community again. 
 I wish I could end there. 
 [ Inhales deeply ] 
 But the truth is, I'm still finding my footing. 
 All I've known for the last year has been the 2nd Mass and the resistance. 
 And so, as much as I admire what you've done, I can't help but to agree with Jeanne Weaver and wonder if somehow our real mission has been lost. 
 [ Spectators murmuring ] 
 I want to read you something that a friend of mine wrote about a different war. 
 "There were some who advocated accommodation, "who believed the enemy would only be enraged 
 "by outright rebellion. 
 "But they were outnumbered 
 "by those who understood that freedom would only come once the enemy had been driven from their land." 
 That was written by Arthur Manchester. 
 About the American struggle against the British during our revolution. 
 But he might as well have been writing about today. 
 Man: Right. 
 Woman: Yeah! 
 I've met our enemy. 
 I've seen what it's done to our children. 
 I've looked in its eyes, and I've heard it speak. 
 And I am telling you that these creatures will leave our world only when we force them to! 
 That's right. That's right. 
 I  know that I have to keep fighting. 
 This community has to make its own call. 
 But understand -e can't hide from them anymore. 
 [ Indistinct shouting ] 
 Clemons: General Bressler! General Bressler! 
 Sergeant? Sergeant! 
 What is it? 
 Sorry, sir. We have a situation that couldn't wait. 
 Our salvage unit found a de-harnessed boy at the perimeter. 
 They're bringing him in now. 
 De-harnessed boy? Did he say what he wanted? 
 Only that he had been looking for Charleston and that he has a message for Tom Mason. 
 Ben? 
 Manchester: You know this boy? 
 No. 
 I'm Tom Mason. 
 Young man: I was told to find you -hat you were the only one who would understand. 
 Told by who? By Ben? Have you seen my son? 
 I'm sorry. I don't know him. 
 But there's so many of us now. 
 I'm to tell you there's been a development with the Overlords, and there isn't much time. 
 Who sent you? 
 The one with the red eye -he leader of the rebellion. 
 He's waiting nearby so you can talk. 
 I'll take you to him when you're ready. 
 I'm ready. 
 Manchester: Gentlemen, come, come. 
 This is insane. They could be right outside the door. 
 If they wanted to attack this place, it'd be on fire by now. 
 Tom: Arthur, I know it sounds risky, but we have to hear them out. 
 Tom's right. 
 This alliance is the only tactical advantage we have. 
 We lose it, we're back to square one. 
 We've been waiting for the right time to launch an offensive. 
 No. It's too dangerous. 
 Especially since we don't know what else has been kept from us. 
 What do you mean? 
 You should have told me your son was a part of this revolution. 
 That's how this one found us, isn't it? 
 Ben always knew we were coming to Charleston. 
 Well, God only knows what else he's told them. 
 General, put the boy in lockup, reinforce our defensive perimeter. 
 We're gonna hunker down, play dead, and hope the aliens will give us a pass. 
 Yes, sir. 
 Let's go. He's going to lockup. 
 Yes, sir. 
 Tom, stay. 
 [ Sighs ] 
 It's all right. 
 [ Sighs ] 
 I expected a challenge from my enemies, but not from my friend. 
 When did Bressler get to you? 
 You know better than that. 
 Then what are you looking for? 
 A position in the new government? 
 Because you had that -o questions asked. 
 Arthur, did you hear that boy? 
 This is not the time to be arguing politics. 
 We have to hear them out. 
 No. Bressler's sees an opening, he'll -- 
 Arthur -- 
 Tom, I offered you my hand. You slapped it away. 
 Now we both have to live with it. 
 [ Sighs ] 
 Pope: Get your hands off me, you stupid jarhead! 
 [ Grunts ] 
 What the hell is this? 
 It's your first decent meal since you were locked up. 
 Please. 
 Mmm. 
 I wanted to ask you about Tom Mason. 
 I've been hearing some peculiar rumors. 
 [ Muffled ] Mason's been peculiar since the day I met him. 
 So what? 
 I'm concerned about the safety of our compound. 
 And I know that you two don't like one another. 
 If you have anything on Mason that could impact our security, I'll look into letting you out. 
 So, the deal is... 
 I give up Mason, Mason burns... 
 And I walk free? 
 I only want the truth. 
 [ Laughs ] 
 Truth is... 
 Tom Mason is a... pompous, semi-erudite history buff with delusions of grandeur. 
 And if anybody is gonna knock him off his pedestal... 
 It's gonna be me... 
 And not some two-bit tin-pot dictator of Charleston, S.C. 
 Salud. 
 Take him out. 
 Man: Yes, sir. 
 Hey. Here to see Maggie. 
 Yeah. 
 [ Grunts ] 
 Dai: Better make this fast. 
 What the hell are you doing? 
 [ Grunts ] Aliens are planning a new offensive. 
 Rebel Skitters sent that de-harnessed kid to guide us to a meeting, but Manchester won't let us go. 
 So I'm going anyway, and I'd like you to come with. 
 You sure that's a good idea? 
 Nothing's changed between us. 
 That's where you're wrong. 
 Do you know why I needed time to think after you told me about your bad-girl past? 
 Tell me. 
 'Cause it didn't make sense. 
 I don't know that Maggie. I've never met her before. 
 [ Panting ] 
 Only Maggie I know is the one standing right here in front of me -he one who saved my butt more times than I can count, and put her own life on the line for the 2nd Mass over and over again. 
 All right, the war wiped the slate clean. 
 I'm no longer Hal the high-school jock, and you're not Maggie the junkie thief. 
 That might be the only good thing that came from this whole mess - chance to start over, to become better people than we were before. 
 Nice speech. 
 You been practicing? 
 A little. 
 [ Chuckles softly ] 
 But right now, me, dad, and the rest are heading into the field. 
 I'd feel a hell of a lot better knowing you had my back. 
 I'm in. 
 Hey! What about me?! 
 We good? 
 Clear. Come on up. 
 Let's go! 
 I managed to get you this stuff without too much fuss. 
 You should be clear all the way into the city. 
 The bikes are parked right outside. 
 You're taking a hell of a chance to help us, Jim. 
 I take a chance every time I drink coffee in this place. 
 I just hope you have it right about the Skitters. 
 Tector: Drop your weapons and step back! 
 [ Door opens ] 
 Stand down. 
 Hal. 
 You're all under arrest. 
 Manchester's orders. 
 He's declared a state of emergency. 
 All suspected dissidents are being detained. 
 You son of a bitch. Are you ever gonna grow a backbone? 
 Colonel, that's enough! 
 At ease. 
 General, I saw how you were with Manchester. 
 You know this is the right move. 
 I know how Manchester sees it, too. 
 Seems to me you ought to start thinking about these people instead of your position,  General. 
 [ Chuckles ] 
 What the hell do you want from me? 
 Talk to Manchester -onvince him we're right. 
 Bressler: Cuff them and take them inside. 
 Man: Yes, sir! 
 Sergeant Murphy! 
 I'm sorry, sir. 
 I respectfully refuse. 
 Take him, too. 
 General. 
 Man: Come on. Let's go. 
 Move! Move! 
 Man on P.A.:  All members of the 2nd Mass are to report to the commons area immediately. 
 All members of the 2nd Mass are to report to the commons area immediately. Man: Get down and shut up! Get down on the ground! Clemons: Damn it, I want this area cleared! Take them. [ Grunts ] What do you think you're doing?! This is crazy! These people haven't hurt anyone! Not yet. But some of them must have known that Tom would try to reach out to his rebel Skitters. If you hurt them -- They were stopped, thank God. But I can't risk someone else from the 2nd Mass making the same mistake. So you're locking us up? Until you prove you can be trusted, yes. And who makes that decision? You? Make sure you get them all. Is this really the kind of democracy you were hoping to create? Man: Down! [ Indistinct shouting ] Arthur, they told us you separated the 2nd Mass from the rest of the compound. You should have told me what they did to you, Tom -bout the implant that they put in your eye. And the infection that almost killed you, Captain. For all I know, you've been taking orders from the aliens ever since you arrived. Who told you this? Pope? Your friends in the 2nd Mass. Once they understood the gravity of the situation, several of them spoke up. Once you put them in custody and threatened their families. Arthur, we have a chance to really hurt the enemy. Put them with the others. And then what? We organize a civilian trial immediately. The charge is treason. And then we deal with their sympathizers. You do that, you'll have a  real  war on your hands. General Bressler, I gave you an order. If you have seen any member of the 2nd Mass, please report to headquarters immediately. What are they gonna do to us? If you have seen any members of the 2nd Mass, I don't know, Matt. Please report to military headquarters immediately. We were safer on our own, weren't we? [ Buzzer ] Open the cells. Let them out -- all of them. Take your hands off me. Dad, what's going on? I built this compound. These are my people. Bressler: The civilian government's been suspended. Charleston is now under martial law. Arthur, you got to believe I didn't want this. Well, you got it. Your damned alliance is gonna kill us all. You want to make that rendezvous with your rebel Skitters, I suggest you suck it up - and fast. Pope: Nice work, boys. Looks like you dropped us all into the middle of a good old-fashioned coup.
