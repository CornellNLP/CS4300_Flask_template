 You know, can we count that as the talk and avoid it for another week?

 Babe, you don't need to impress them. 
 You've spent time together; you know they like you. 
 Yeah, they like me, but do they love me?

 I'm the one that diagnosed him with renal disease. 
 His creatinine's been stable for six months. 
 He's been managing fine on reduced function. 
 Before we panic, let's just wait for the test results. 
 Maybe we just need to readjust his treatment plan. 
 You didn't see him on the floor of my dining room.

 Well, here's an idea, maybe... maybe don't hate her. 
 You know, we had a saying in my family. 
 "If your arms are full from carrying the burden of anger, you won't be able to see where to put it down." 
 Is that like a Hindu proverb? 
 Yeah, no, it's from a Bollywood movie. 
 But I think it applies here. 
 If you're so angry with your father and Isabelle and you can't see past that to forgive them, then...

 What'd you end up saying to your dad? 
 I haven't talked to him yet. 
 Oh, come on, Alex. 
 You know what? 
 Let me get to the bottom of the pitcher first. 
 No, no, no, no. Come on, tell me why. 
 Pretend I'm Dr. Hackett or Pierce. 
 Or you. 
 Or me. 
 Okay. 
 When you watched "Wizard of Oz" as a kid, what was the scariest thing? 
 The witch. 
 No, flying monkeys. 
 Yeah, for me, it's when they see the man behind the curtain and realize none of it's true. 
 There is no Great and Powerful Oz. 
 The world as we know it is a lie. 
 Yeah? 
 I feel like I'm nine years old again, having an existential crisis, only instead of Oz, it's my parents. 
 So where's the lie? They're both... 
 All those moments we spent together as a family, they're different. 
 I have to go back and rethink everything. 
 Well, while you're rethinking the past, the rest of us will be in the present, waiting for you when you finally catch up. 
 Catch up to what? 
 Reality. You're still avoiding it. 
 You know, it's starting to sink in how he can love both of them and want both of them in his life. 
 What's the matter with me? 
 What kind of person does that make me? 
 [upbeat ukulele music] 
 Oh, your ancestry results? 
 That was fast. 
 I know somebody in the lab. 
 [sighs] You should do the honors. 
 Let's share this moment together. 
 Who are you? 
 Oh, my God! 
 Not Korean. 
 Damn it. 
 I'm sorry. 
 But you do have some Scottish ancestry. 
 That might explain the golf. 
 No, stop. What are you doing? 
 That's called "fire chicken" in English, okay? 
 I'm not giving up. 
 Seriously, you're gonna feel like dying later. 
 You don't have to... eat that for me. 
 I... 
 Where's Isabelle Dixon? 
 Uh, she checked out early, but I think she left you something. 
 [somber music] 
 Dear Alex, Gerard taught me to always drink wine with someone when you part ways. 
 That way, you're sure to remember them fondly. 
 I hope that someday, you'll come to remember me fondly and understand that your father doesn't love you and your mother any less for loving me. 
 Yours, Isabelle.
