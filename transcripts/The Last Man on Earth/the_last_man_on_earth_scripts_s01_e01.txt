(Chuckles) Actually, I saw you a long time ago, and I always wanted to come say hi, but, well, I don't know, I just, uh... It never felt like the right time. I like your outfit. You make good style choices. (Laughs): Sorry, I-I'm being so... Forward. It's just, I've been through a lot lately. I just realized that having other people around is really what makes life worth living. Where are my manners? I'm Phil. You win. You win. Well, in about two minutes, we will lay to rest Phil Miller. Uh... I'm sorry for giving up. Oh, and I just got to say, huge apology to Tom Hanks and the whole crew  that put together castaway. 'Cause they nailed it. They friggin' nailed it. You guys were the best friends that I could ask for. But you're not people. You're not people. (Engine starts) (Engine revving) ♪ 
♪ (Sniffs) (Clears throat) Hello! Hello! Are you okay? Um... Uh... I think so. Wh-where'd you get here? What happened? I saw all your billboards. I can't believe you found me! I... I thought I was...

I-I was-was, uh, swimming the front, the... the front side. Okay, I just thought that you were in trouble... Well, you thought wrong! That was from something else before, I told you!

Put your hands where I can see them! Okay, okay, okay, okay... Hands where I can see them! Okay, okay. Drop my bra. Okay, okay, okay. No! Drop it! Gross. Are you nice? What? Are you a nice person?! Okay, yes, yes! I'm really nice! I'm very, very, very nice! I'm so nice, seriously. I promise you. There is nothing to be afraid of. Nothing of which to be afraid. But I just said that. You can't end sentences with prepositions! "Nothing of which to be afraid" is the proper grammar! Fine, yes, okay. There's nothing of which... Yes. Huh? That's better. Good with that? Of which to be afraid, okay? Mm-hmm. Huh? You can trust me, seriously. Honestly? I did wet my underpants. They were totally dry before I soaked them. I soaked them. Why did you lie to me? 'Cause I'm an adult and I wet my underpants. Are you the one who put up all those "alive in Tucson" signs? Yes! Yes! That was me. That was me. I did that. Look. I am so sorry. I haven't seen another human being in, like, two years. And I was literally about to kill myself five minutes ago. I'm harmless, okay? Why don't you put that gun away? What do you need that gun out for? Don't you mean "out for what do you need that gun"? Okay, that can't be right. It is. No, come on. No, no, no! You don't have to cock that thing! Fine. Look. Out for what do you need that gun? Huh? Come on. I'm not gonna hurt you. Why don't you put that thing away? There you go. I'm a quick draw. So watch yourself. Thank you, thank you. Can we start over? Yeah, okay. Phil Miller. Last man on earth. Carol Pilbasian. Last woman on earth. ♪ Amen ♪
