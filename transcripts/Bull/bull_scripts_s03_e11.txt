 The trip was amazing; it was perfect. 
 We swam with stingrays. 
 Randy got a great tan. 
 And then it rained for two days, so we got married. 
 ...taking off shortly. 
 Yes, Aunt Diana, for real. 
 I know it sounds crazy, but I'm telling you, it was meant to be. 
 Thank you. 
 I got to go, we're at our seats. 
 Yes, I have lots of pictures. 
 I'll send pictures. 
 Okay. Love you, too. 
 Sounds like that went all right. 
 Hello? 
 Mr. Greene. 
 My boss. 
 Uh, no, I'm still out of the country. 
 Another two days. 
 Uh, I'm actually on a plane right now, getting ready to take off. 
 Can't you get Emerson to help you? 
 You're alone? 
 Well, like I said, I'm-I'm on a plane full of people. 
 I-I know they don't know what we're talking about, but still, it makes me nervous. 
 And besides, I don't know your combination. 
 I only know mine. 
 Okay, no, it's fine. 
 I'm being silly. 
 Do you have a pencil? 
 Okay, here goes. 
 77... 
 63... 
 11, 46. 
 Can you say it back to me? 
 Exactly. 
 Nope, no trouble at all, Mr. Greene. 
 Oh, and by the way, when you see me in two days, I'll have a new last name. 
 Uh-huh, I got married. 
 No, you don't need to make us a ring. 
 You, too. Okay. 
 That was like watching a foreign film without the subtitles. 
 Oh. Poor Mr. Greene. 
 He needs to sell the store. 
 He's too old. 
 I mean, he can't even remember his combination to the safe anymore. 
 He wants to make us a ring. 
 I told you, I have a ring. 
 Yeah, well, talk is cheap. 
 Sorry, allergies. 
 Oh. 
 Congratulations. 
 Heard you on the phone. 
 Oh. Thank you. 
 Boss wants to make you a ring, huh? 
 I'm guessing you're in jewelry. 
 Retail? 
 Yeah, it's not my forever job, but it pays the rent. 
 My ex-wife was in jewelry. Oh. 
 I think she wore the same perfume you're wearing. 
 Eau de Bonne Jeunesse? 
 Y-Yeah. Randy got it for me. 
 Always made me sneeze. Oh, I'm sorry. 
 Everything makes me sneeze. 
 Three more hours before the sun comes up. 
 I'm gonna try and get some sleep. 
 Okay. You want to get out before I settle in? 
 No, I'm good. 
 Okay, see you in the morning, newlywed. 
 See you in the morning. 
 No. No, no, no. 
 No. 
 What's the matter? I can't find my phone. 
 I have all my pictures on that phone. 
 Our-our wedding, our honeymoon. 
 I have everything on that phone. 
 Well, it's got to be here someplace. 
 I'll call it from my phone. Oh. Is this it? 
 Oh, my God. 
 Yes. It was on the floor. 
 Yes. Yes, thank you. 
 Maybe I'm crazy but it feels like some of you is missing. 
 Well, I made a pledge the last time you left, I wouldn't eat until you returned. 
 Well, had I known that, I would have stayed away for another six months. 
 Oh. Hmm. 
 Don't take this the wrong way, I'm thrilled that you're here. 
 But what is this dire emergency you woke me out of a dead sleep for? 
 I just didn't know who else to call. 
 I flew in from Texas last night and I'm staring at an arraignment in 20 minutes and... while I do believe with all my heart that you are one of the dumbest hunks of man that I have ever had the pleasure of sharing pleasure with... 
 I will also concede... that no one can navigate a New York City courtroom better than you. 
 I feel so cheap when women just use me for my mind. 
 Obviously, I'll get you through the arraignment but let's start with who you're representing and what's the crime? 
 I'm here for my niece. 
 What's the charge? 
 Armed robbery. 
 In the matter of The People v. Claire and Randy Markes... how do you plead? 
 Both Claire and Randy Markes plead not guilty, Your Honor. 
 Counsel, would you like to be heard as to bail? 
 We certainly would, Your Honor. 
 Your Honor, the People at this time would ask that no bail be offered. 
 On a burglary charge? 
 The store's owner is still in the hospital and the prognosis for his recovery is not yet clear. 
 We could be looking at murder charges in the days to come. 
 Additionally, the defendants recently traveled to... 
 Thailand, Sri Lanka, and the Maldives, which doesn't have an extradition treaty with the U.S. It's the People's view that the defendants represent a very real flight risk. 
 Oh, my God. Your Honor. 
 Please. My clients have no record of previous charges, no record of previous arrests. 
 They don't even have points on their driver's licenses. 
 Be that as it may, the court will accept the A.D.A.'s recommendations and deny bail at this time. 
 Ask the court officer to find a place we can meet with our clients before they're taken back to jail. 
 None of this makes any sense. 
 All right, well, let's just start at the beginning, okay? 
 Now, this is my friend, Dr. Jason Bull. 
 He's a legal genius. 
 But we don't tell him that to his face because we don't want to make his head any bigger. 
 He'll be assisting us with the trial and doing everything he possibly can to make sure that we get you out of here as quickly as we can. 
 So, both of you will be representing both of us? 
 We'll work out the particulars later but right now, I'd like to get Dr. Bull up to speed. 
 Okay, the store that Claire works at, it's a, uh, mom-and-pop jewelry store in Brooklyn. 
 It was robbed at gunpoint two nights ago at 2:30 in the morning. 
 Everybody wore masks and gloves but we have a ton of video. 
 Unfortunately, the two robbers very much resemble both Claire and Randy, height-wise and weight-wise. 
 Okay, and what about this man who was hurt? 
 The one who's in the hospital? 
 Mr. Greene. 
 He's old and starting to lose it. 
 Sometimes he forgets where he is. 
 Sometimes he forgets who he is. 
 Apparently, he was sleeping in his office when the robbers came in. 
 The police said he was pistol-whipped to within an inch of his life. 
 Hmm. Okay. 
 And what convinced the authorities you two were involved? 
 Well, the safe they hit... keeps track of every time it's opened and who opened it. 
 Now, each store manager, they... and really, there are only three, including the owner. 
 They have their own combination. 
 Hmm. And somehow the robbers knew to use yours. 
 Okay. 
 Let's talk alibi. 
 What were you two doing at 2:30 in the morning when the store was being robbed and your boss was being beaten? 
 Well, at 2:30 in the morning we were where we were supposed to be. 
 At home in bed together. 
 I'm Randy, by the way. 
 Yeah, it's nice to meet you, Randy. 
 And unfortunately, two codefendants, two married codefendants vouching for each other is not the world's strongest alibi. 
 I'm assuming that there's no one staying with you? 
 No one called in the middle of the night? 
 No. Like we told the police, it was just us. 
 Asleep by midnight. 
 So, can I count on you? 
 You know, back me up? 
 Whisper in my ear? 
 How well do you know your niece's new husband? 
 This is the first time I ever met him. 
 Ah, and you love him already. Mm. 
 What's this? 
 Randy's record. 
 He has a record. 
 Ah, there's a couple of juvie convictions. 
 One for petty theft. 
 He got in a bar fight three years ago. 
 He hit someone in the head with a guitar. 
 Is this guy a musician? 
 Well... based on this record, he could be a Supreme Court justice. 
 I'm here to represent her. 
 I don't even know him. And that's fine. 
 They should have separate representation. 
 You don't want either one of them looking back and thinking that their lawyer wasn't looking out for them and only them. 
 Okay, good. 
 So he's not my problem. 
 But he is. 
 What you don't want is this guy you don't know out there on his own with his own legal team, his own narrative that you can't control. 
 You know, this would be a much easier conversation with a drink. 
 Why don't we do this? 
 You represent Claire, my firm will represent Randy. 
 You'd do that? 
 Why? 
 For you. 
 And because it's smart; I got a hundred reasons. 
 Name one. 
 Well, let's start with the A.D.A. 
 First chance he gets, he's gonna offer your niece or her husband a deal. 
 Divide and conquer. 
 They're innocent. 
 Well, at least she is. 
 Any defense is only as good as its weakest link. 
 You let Randy fall into the clutches of some public defender who's juggling 
 16 other cases... Okay. 
 Okay, I see where you're going. 
 Two separate defense teams. 
 Working together. You and me. 
 It's just really important we're completely transparent with one another; we need to send a message to the A.D.A. that neither one of us is gonna sell the other side out and that there's no point trying to smear Randy with 15-year-old charges from when he was in middle school. 
 You really are something. 
 So here's the plan: 
 I'll provide TAC resources for both sides. 
 You represent Claire and Benny'll represent Randy. 
 Hmm. 
 So what are you drinking? 
 Oh. 
 I'm sure I'll find something. 
 How'd it go? I just got off the phone with him. 
 He filled me in, e-mailed me all the relevant work product. 
 Ah. Well, then, let's do this. 
 What's the matter? 
 I don't know. 
 Something in his voice. 
 He sounded like the old Bull. Well, we love the old Bull. 
 Not that old Bull. 
 Marissa, he and Diana are old friends. 
 It's no secret they enjoy the hell out of each other. 
 He probably just... stayed out past his curfew. 
 Besides... 
 ...he's gonna do what he's gonna do. 
 So, the plan of action is to request a joint trial for Claire and Randy. 
 One jury for both defendants? 
 That's what he wants. 
 But wouldn't conventional wisdom be to split them up? 
 Well, since Bull and Diana are so close, and since the two defendants are newlyweds, Bull is throwing out the conventional wisdom on this one. 
 He believes the optics are just too good to ignore. 
 The jury seeing them together, it all feeds into the narrative. 
 Which is... 
 They just didn't do it. They couldn't have done it. 
 Someone is setting them up, taking advantage of two sweet young kids who just got married and are being wrongly jailed for something they didn't do. 
 We'll lean on reasonable doubt, present character evidence for both of them, and then hope, in the meantime, that the real robbers slip up and somehow reveal themselves. 
 Well, I can put in a call to the FBI. 
 I've got a friend who can check on the chatter of known fences, and pawn shops that deal in stolen diamonds. 
 Then I'll head over to the jewelry store, talk to the girl's coworkers, see what they know. 
 And I should head over to court, meet our new clients, say hi to Diana and get ready for the start of voir dire. 
 And give me a call if I have anything I need to worry about on that other front. 
 He's fine. 
 He's a big boy, Marissa. 
 There she is! 
 I've been looking all over for the two of you. 
 Come here. Where's the big guy? 
 Yeah, we've, uh... really been slammed at work lately. 
 I honestly don't know when the man sleeps. 
 Right now. 
 Right. And last night. 
 We went out for drinks. 
 He was on his second one, and that man looked like he was about to keel over. Mm. 
 Last time I was here, it took two just to prime his pump. 
 Yeah, well, you know, the problem is the man never gets a break. 
 I think I'm gonna just slip in there and, uh, yeah, give him a little nudge. 
 Did I drift off? 
 Looks that way. 
 Diana's waiting for you outside. 
 Oh, she's something, isn't she? Mm. 
 Sounds like you had a bit of a rugged night. 
 Oh, no, just, uh, a little out of practice. 
 Oh. Well, I'm confused. 
 I didn't know you needed to practice. 
 I thought you were retired. 
 It was "Old Timers' Day." 
 Felt good to be back on the field. 
 Ah, well, I wouldn't want to deny you that. 
 But voir dire is calling. 
 Ah, well, if voir dire is calling, we must answer. 
 It's Claire's combination. 
 It's Claire's place of employment. 
 She's a young married woman with a musician for a husband, so of course she needs money. 
 And that means what? 
 That means we want jurors who tend to believe the simplest explanation is not always the right one. 
 You mean like conspiracy theorists? 
 No, not necessarily that radical. 
 Just people who are willing to consider alternative narratives. 
 Show of hands. Area 51. Proof of aliens? 
 Or... Area 51. Government hoax? 
 I'm confused. 
 We want to keep the folks who believe we're being visited by little green men, or we want to keep the people who believe Area 51 is a government hoax? 
 We keep 'em all for the moment. 
 They're willing to believe something they don't know for certain and can't really prove. 
 And then we do our best to try and get rid of the ones who didn't raise their hand for either choice. 
 Good morning. 
 I'm afraid I owe you all an apology. 
 On your way in, I picked your pockets and stole all your wallets. 
 I noticed that you didn't need to check your pockets, sir. 
 No. And why not? 
 Because I know there's no way in the world you took my wallet. 
 Barry Fletcher. Of course he's a skeptic. 
 He works as an actuary at an insurance company. 
 A non-believer and a numbers cruncher. 
 The defense would ask the court to thank and excuse juror number seven. 
 Juror number 11. 
 I couldn't help but notice that you checked. 
 Your purse, your pockets, your coat. 
 Well, I thought maybe you were just messing with us, but you can never be too careful. 
 Sophia Holmes. Unemployed. 
 And according to her credit card statement, she sees a tarot card reader at least once a month. 
 I've died and gone to heaven. 
 Now, just to be clear, you needed to be sure. 
 You had a doubt. A reasonable doubt. 
 Sure. 
 Thank you, Benny. 
 Plant the seed. Reasonable doubt. 
 Say it loud, you're unsure and you're proud. 
 That is terrific news. I'll pass it along. 
 What's terrific news? 
 I could use some terrific news. 
 The store's owner, Mr. Greene, is recovering quite nicely, and may even be well enough to testify tomorrow. 
 That's excellent. Mm. 
 So much for murder charges. 
 Maybe we could even revisit the question of bail. 
 Well, thank you for dinner, sir. 
 I can feel your heart beating. 
 That's always a good sign. 
 So tomorrow it starts. 
 Yup. Tomorrow it starts. 
 You want to run that opening statement by me? 
 No. I want to go dancing. 
 Excuse me? Mm. 
 Once this trial starts, we're not gonna have any time. 
 Every night is gonna be about preparing for the next day. 
 It's the last night of summer vacation. 
 I want to go dancing. 
 I haven't been dancing in 15 years. 
 Well, all the more reason to go, then. 
 I will go dancing. Mm. 
 And we will go back to your hotel room. 
 You're reading my mind. 
 And then you will read me your opening statement. 
 There will be openings. Oh? 
 There will be statements. 
 I don't know if there'll be any reading, but... then again, you never know. 
 Hmm. Mm.

 Baby, you still with us? 
 I need to go. 
 Um... you do understand what is next on the menu, don't you? 
 Um... 
 I'll explain it to you later. I just, uh... 
 I have to... 
 I've got to get some fresh air. 
 Uh, who are you and what have you done with Jason Bull? 
 I'm so sorry. 
 First witness for the prosecution after lunch is your boss. 
 Okay. Good. 
 He must be doing better. 
 He loves me. 
 Well, be that as it may, if the prosecution didn't think he had something to offer, they wouldn't be putting him on the stand. 
 What could he offer? We weren't there. 
 I have no idea. But let's drill down on the obvious for a second. It was your combination that opened the safe that night. 
 If it wasn't you, who was it? 
 Uh, how would I know? 
 Dr. Bull... Have you ever shared your combination with anyone who isn't authorized to have it? 
 No. Is it written down somewhere where someone could find? 
 No. So you've never told your combination to anyone, never even uttered it out loud? 
 No. 
 Yes. 
 Five days before the robbery, Mr. Greene called me. 
 He forgets things. 
 He forgot his combination, and I gave him mine. 
 He forgets things? 
 Forgets the combination to his own safe? 
 Well, he's old. 
 And I know it kills him to ask for help. 
 Well, obviously your boss didn't rob and pistol-whip himself. 
 That's the only time you can recall? 
 That's the only time it ever happened. 
 Uh, we didn't do this. 
 He knows you didn't do anything, honey. 
 Well, there is one more thing I want to clear up. 
 The D.A.'s office sent these over last night. 
 Look familiar? 
 Yeah. 
 I have one just like it. Or, I did. 
 I think I lost it in Thailand. 
 Well, this was found outside the jewelry store the night of the robbery. 
 Police, at first, didn't think there was any connection. 
 Took them a couple days to, uh, find the camp, and get a list of the people who were at the reunion. 
 Only 200 of these were made. 
 What are you implying? 
 Why don't you tell us? 
 There's nothing to tell. 
 I was in bed beside my wife the entire night. 
 And I haven't seen that hat since we got back. 
 Tell them, honey. 
 I actually don't know anything about your hat. 
 No, I mean, tell them I was in bed with you the whole night. 
 She's already told us that. 
 No one's implying anything. 
 We're all in this together. 
 I was sleeping in my office. 
 Do you do that often? 
 It's not something I plan. 
 Lot of times at night, I can't sleep. 
 So when I come in the next day to work, I'm exhausted. 
 I close up, sit down in my office about 8:00, do my paperwork, and end up conking out in my chair. 
 So what happened? 
 Ah. Alarm went off, 2:30 in the morning, scared the life out of me. 
 And the only way they can get through is in the front, and that's where I went. 
 And, uh, you encountered the robbers. 
 Yes, sir. 
 Did you get a good look at them? 
 Not their faces. They had masks on. 
 Uh, h-he was kind of tall, uh, and she was a, uh... a she. 
 Sort of like the two defendants, seated over there? 
 Objection. Counsel is testifying. 
 Sustained. 
 Hi. 
 M-Mr. Greene? 
 She's my Clairey. 
 Works in the store. She's a lifesaver. 
 Let's just call for a verdict right now. 
 Easy, big boy. 
 It ain't over till it's over, and this one's barely begun. Excuse me. 
 No one asked you. If I want to hear the truth, I'll go out into the hall and talk to myself. 
 So you confronted the robbers. 
 I sure did. 
 And the tall one confronted me. 
 Took his gun and he started hitting me in the head. 
 Uh, and then I fell down, and-and then, I must've passed out. 
 Is there anything else you remember that happened prior to you losing consciousness? 
 One thing. I heard the woman say something. 
 What did she say? 
 She said, "Randy, stop it. 
 You're killing him." 
 "Randy." 
 Are you positive that's what she called him? 
 Oh, yeah. 
 100%. Randy. 
 I am so sorry, Bull. 
 It's that good, huh? 
 "Sea of red" doesn't even get it done. 
 What did I just tell you about the truth? 
 Excuse me. 
 Could you drop me off first? 
 Switch seats with me. 
 Switch seats with me. Come on. 
 Call me crazy, but I sense some antagonism here in the back seat. 
 "Randy," hmm? Isn't that your client's name? 
 
 
 
 Apparently, that was one of the burglar's names. 
 Well, thank goodness all this anger isn't personal. 
 Ha, well, it's a little personal. 
 I can take the subway. 
 You know, lots of people are named Randy. 
 I can attest to that. 
 And we have no way of knowing if the Randy Mr. Greene thinks he heard referred to is our Randy. 
 Could be a whole different Randy. 
 Could even have been "Andy," or "Sandy." 
 He makes an excellent point. 
 Sometimes the people you think are Randy aren't. 
 Don't I know it. 
 I can take the subway. 
 Benny could cross-examine Mr. Greene tomorrow morning. 
 We already know he's forgetful. 
 It wouldn't be very difficult to convince the jury that he is a less than reliable witness. 
 My client would have a serious issue with that, thank you very much. 
 She loves Mr. Greene, and thinks that he has been through enough. 
 Excuse me, you can drop me off right here. 
 I'll see you in the morning, Benny. 
 Seriously, I could take the subway. 
 Your scars look good. 
 Your heart sounds good. 
 I'm gonna give you the name of my stylist, see if he can do something fun with your unruly chest hair. 
 But first, why don't you tell me what spooked you so bad that you had to see me at 7:00 in the morning? 
 You get lightheaded in the gym? 
 Short of breath walking to work? 
 Actually, I was with a woman the other night... 
 Ah, I'm thrilled for you. 
 She and I have known each other for a long time. 
 And one thing led to another... 
 And...? And my heart started to pound. Okay. 
 Is it supposed to do that? 
 It depends. How excited were you to be with this woman? 
 Does she know about your history? 
 What you've been through this past year? 
 Your operation was... last May. 
 I'm assuming that you've been in this situation prior to this? 
 Or... maybe not? 
 Any particular reason? I mean, religion, pain or something that I should know about? 
 I've certainly thought about it. 
 You know, it's not unusual for men who suffer a cardiac arrest to shy away from intimacy, and convince themselves that in all the excitement, they might give themselves another heart attack. 
 You're saying that like it's not the case. 
 You're in better shape now than in all the time I've known you. 
 The problem is not with your heart. 
 The problem's in your head, said the heart surgeon to the head doctor. 
 You like this woman? You trust this woman? 
 Tell her your history. 
 Tell her what you're feeling, and if she's still interested, then you have nothing to fear. 
 What if you're wrong? 
 Well, if I'm wrong, you die. 
 But what a way to go. 
 We are not welcome. 
 Diana's client wanted some time alone with her attorney. 
 Where's Randy? Guard took him to court. 
 I've been standing here waiting for you. 
 I couldn't help but sense a little something in the car last night. 
 Is our alliance here starting to fall apart? 
 I have no idea. 
 But I'd love to know what they're talking about in there. 
 Do you remember yesterday, when Randy said he hadn't seen his hat since Thailand? 
 Sure. 
 He wore it onto the plane home. 
 So he did have it here in New York. 
 I don't know. All I know is that he wore it onto the plane. 
 I-I'm guessing he threw it into his carry-on bag or something. 
 Do you think maybe he just forgot? 
 That's why I'm talking to you, Aunt Diana. 
 I don't know what to think. 
 Okay, honey. Okay... 
 I need you both in the courtroom. 
 The judge is about to take the bench. 
 All right. 
 Are you ready? 
 Prosecution calls Jacqueline Stone to the stand. 
 Uh, objection. 
 Your Honor, we have no knowledge of this witness. 
 Neither did we until last night. 
 Witness can testify. I'll give you time to prepare for cross-examination. 
 Who is this woman? Do you know her? 
 Ask Randy. She's my ex-girlfriend. 
 Ex-fiancée. 
 I dated him for almost two years, and then we decided to get married. 
 What happened? 
 You'd have to ask him. 
 He texted me, said something just didn't feel right. 
 Wow. 
 You talk to him after that? Not for a long time. 
 But you heard from him recently? 
 Yes, uh, he's actually been calling a lot lately. 
 I'm guessing you know what's going on over here. 
 You don't need to say anything. 
 I can actually feel the love. 
 Any reason in particular? 
 He wanted his engagement ring back. 
 He said it was his grandmother's. I told him that if he wanted it back, he could come to my place one night and pick it up. 
 See that? Oh ye of little faith. 
 He wanted the ring back for Claire. 
 And did he? Did he come to your place? 
 He did, around midnight. 
 We hung out for a while. 
 Talked about old times. 
 Look, I'm not given to panic, but if she starts testifying that they slept together, I need you to call in a bomb threat. 
 And then what happened? 
 He told me that he met someone. 
 Told me that was why he wanted the ring back. 
 I got upset. 
 I told him he was never getting it back, and he left. 
 Your Honor... 
 Okay. We lived. 
 Honestly? That was a whole lot of nothing. 
 Um... one last question. 
 Do you recall what night this was? 
 The night Randy came by? 
 Uh, December 6th. 
 That's the same night the jewelry store was burglarized. 
 So if the defendants were to tell the police that they were home that night sleeping, they'd be lying, wouldn't they? 
 Well, they'd be lying about Randy, that's for sure. 
 And if you don't believe me, you can ask the doorman at my building. He let Randy in and out. 
 No further questions. 
 Okay, let's just call for a recess. 
 That'll give us enough time to... 
 Cross-examination, Your Honor? 
 Oh, I thought your team would want time to prepare for cross, but by all means. 
 Just to be clear, you're testifying that at the night of the burglary, you and Mr. Markes were together. 
 You and Mr. Markes. 
 So you don't actually know the whereabouts of my client, do you? What is she doing? Objection! 
 Grounds? 
 Withdrawn. 
 What do you know, "backstabbing" isn't grounds for objection. 
 You're a woman, aren't you? 
 Last I checked. 
 And you're roughly my client's height and build. 
 Well, maybe Randy has a type. Maybe. 
 Or maybe it was you he was with the night of the burglary. 
 Excuse me? 
 Objection, Your Honor. The witness is not on trial. 
 Sustained. Jury will ignore the question. 
 Withdrawn. No further questions, Your Honor. 
 Some team. 
 Some alliance. Some partnership. 
 Hey, I didn't call Randy's ex to the stand. 
 That was as much of a surprise to me as it was to you. 
 So you just figured, what the hell, we'll just throw him under the bus in front of the jury? 
 You're damn right I did. That man is a liar. 
 Excuse me? He's been lying to us. 
 He's been lying to me. 
 You left me in the middle of the night to go see your ex-fiancée? 
 For the ring. I wanted to give you the ring. 
 But why not tell me? 
 To protect you. To protect your feelings. 
 I didn't want you to be upset. 
 Okay, good plan. What about the hat? 
 What are you talking about? 
 You told everyone in this room that you lost your hat in Thailand, but you know damn well that you were wearing the hat onto the plane home. 
 Was I? 
 Oh. Yeah. 
 So you had it here in New York? 
 Could someone have stolen it from you? 
 But I didn't have it here in New York. 
 I haven't seen it since... 
 I must've left it in the overhead bin. 
 I threw it up there. 
 I was putting our bags up there. 
 You were on the phone with your aunt. 
 Then you were on the phone with your boss... 
 Mr. Greene? 
 Why were you on the phone with your boss while you were on your honeymoon? 
 He didn't know it was going to be a honeymoon. 
 We didn't know it was gonna be a honeymoon. 
 I told you. He forgot his combination to the safe, so I gave him mine. 
 When you say "gave him," you texted? You e-mailed? 
 We were still on the ground, so I just... told him over the phone. 
 Out loud? 
 Boy, I would love to know who was sitting around you when you were on that call. 
 I know someone who might be able to help us with that. 
 See if you can talk to the judge, get us a continuance for a day. 
 Marissa, is Taylor around? 
 Yeah, ask her if she can find a way to access the manifest from the Thailand to New York flight that Randy and Claire were on? 
 I need names, addresses, and final destinations of everyone seated around them. 
 Mm-hmm. 
 Thank you. 
 You're welcome. 
 He has quite a record. 
 Breaking and entering, assault. 
 He seemed so nice. 
 So you're guessing he heard the combination, memorized it. 
 But how did he figure out where Claire worked? 
 Did he ever have access to your phone? 
 You couldn't find it when we were getting off the plane. 
 He must've grabbed it when I was sleeping and then kicked it down the aisle, so I wouldn't know it was him. 
 Grabbed your hat so he could drop it at the scene and guarantee you two would take the blame. 
 Now all we have to do is find him. We're working on it. 
 Did he tell you anything else about himself? 
 Anything at all? 
 Um, he mentioned he'd been married. 
 Okay. 
 Anything else? Um... 
 He didn't like my perfume. Said he was allergic to it. 
 What kind of perfume were you wearing? 
 Eau du Bonne Jeunesse. 
 Our man is on the move. 
 We'll alert the authorities. 
 Just got word. He's out of the apartment. 
 Scotch. Neat. 
 Cup of coffee, please. 
 Bless you. 
 That came out of nowhere. Uh, excuse me. So sorry. 
 No need apologize. In fact, it's probably my fault. 
 Eau du Bonne Jeunesse. 
 It's a gift from a friend of yours. 
 Said she sat next to you on a plane from Thailand to New York. 
 Bless you again, Mr. McCall. 
 Wait a second, how do you know my name? 
 Stephen McCall. I had to give it to the police so they could execute the search warrant. 
 Search warrant? Mm-hmm. 
 They've been at your house for the last ten minutes. 
 Sounds like they might've found something. 
 Stolen goods, that sort of thing. 
 See that? 
 They did. 
 I'd stay in that seat if I were you. 
 Finish your drink. 
 You're not gonna be having one of those for a long time. 
 Besides, they already picked up your accomplice, your ex-wife. 
 She told them everything. 
 That's on me. 
 Is there any better sound in the world than when the judge says "case dismissed"? 
 Not when you're representing the accused and the accused is someone you care about. 
 You think Claire and Randy are gonna be okay? 
 You think they're gonna be okay with me? 
 I really misjudged Randy. 
 Well, I'm no expert, but from my vantage point, it looked like they couldn't wait to get home and resume their honeymoon. 
 I think he knows you were just doing your job, as a lawyer and as an aunt. 
 Oh, this is me. 
 As always, a pleasure, Diana. 
 Safe travels. 
 Take care, Benny. All right. 
 Bye. 
 I have no idea what I'm gonna do for the rest of my day. 
 Hmm. 
 I'm not really good alone. 
 Funny you should mention that. 
 You want to get a drink? 
 I would love to get a drink. 
 Oh. Baby, the bar's over there. 
 Yeah. 
 Thing is... 
 I'm actually trying not to drink. 
 You okay with that? 
 Sure. 
 Thing is, back in May, I-I had this... thing. 
 Uh... 
 I'll tell you about it later. 
 You don't have to. I want to. 
 Okay. 
 Well... if we're not gonna go to the bar, what would you like to do? 
 Well, to be honest, I'd like to go back up to your room and listen to you read your opening statement to the jury again. 
 I should slap you. 
 Patience. I'm sure we'll get to all of that. 
 Well, thank goodness. 
 Now where are those elevators? 
 ♪ Let's stay together... ♪ So what's this thing that happened to you? 
 Oh, patience. Your flight's not till tomorrow. 
 I'm sure we'll get to it. 
 ♪ I... ♪ 
 ♪ I'm so in love with you. ♪
