 What would you like me to do? 
 Talk to her, make her understand. 
 Jonas ... Isn't better if you talk to her yourself? 
 I've tried. She doesn't listen. 
 If I may make a suggestion ... If you give me the gun ... it will be easier to speak. 
 You don't want someone getting hurt. Right? 
 I just want to see my daughter. 
 I understand how you feel. 
 But do you think this is the right way? 
 You don't understand anything. 
 Talk, Eva. They will be there in 5 min. 
 Give me that, and we can talk properly I promise you will see Tova again. 
 Mommy! 
 Tova, go back to your room. 
 What the hell! You said she was not at home.You lied! 
 Stop, daddy. 
 Daddy isn't mad at you. 
 Come, come to daddy. 
 See? You ruined everything! How the hell are we going to be a family now? 
 How the hell do you think you would be? if we can't be together, then we will die together. 
 Sit down, police bitch! 
 Jonas ... 
 What do you think would happen if you       shoot? 
 Sit down! Where the hell are you? 
 You have to kill me first. 
 Eva, what are you doing? 
 You can not. 
 Eva, what happens? 
 Mom! 
 You don't dare! Jonas .. 
 Shoot, then! Shoot, coward ...! 
 Eva, do you hear me? 
 Josefine Where are you, Mom? 
 Josefine ... 
 Josefine Hello, Eva. Are you there? 
 Hi. 
 Hi. 
 It is for the funeral, sorry for your loss. 
 May I come in? 
 Of course. 
 It isn't easy to lose a father like that. 
 We didn't speak for years My father was very ill. I guess he wanted to leave on his own terms. 
 You will be away for long? 
 I don't know. 
 I have something that makes me to go home. 
 If it were me, you'd be in active service again I know. Sorry. I just ... 
 I have to deal with house issues but it will probably not take for long. 
 This is the only reason you are going? 
 I am going there to do what I must do. Nothing more. 
 Lawyer Pierre Hedman, Cellulose of Thörnblads. 
 Leave your name and number after the tone. 
 Hi, I'm Eva Thörnblad. I'll meet you in your office in Silverhöjd tomorrow. 
 Ok. Goodbye. 
 Isn't that Eva? There, next to the tree. 
 Try to get it, I told you. 
 Doesn't print , maybe the paper is jammed? 
 Try to hit it to unblock I'm telling you the paper is jammed! 
 Excuse me ... 
 Yes, I can help you? 
 I came to collect some things. 
 Name? 
 Eva Thörnblad Yes ... ID? 
 Here I would like to talk more with the parents Can you close the door? 
 Sure. So we want ... 
 We have nothing to work! 
 Damaged, from the fire,a watch, a bunch of keys. 
 And for this I need a proper authorization ... 
 Okay ... 
 A pistol. M1911 Silver. Damaged by fire. 
 Yes ... And sorry for your loss. 
 I need to talk to Olof Gran. Is he here? 
 Crazy Gran? No, no He has been away for years. 
 No ... You know where I can find him? 
 No. The cartridge also! Do this again! 
 Thank you The search for Leander Anton ... who disappeared in a playground in Silverhöjd, enters its seventh day. 
 Now police investigation is criticised. 
 Martina Sigvardsson, police chief of Silverhöjd, responded to criticism. 
 We follow rules and guidelines. 
 Of course, we do everything that is in our power to find Anton. 
 Do you think it's a kidnapping? 
 Nothing suggests it, but we don't ruled out any possibility. 
 How do you answer to the criticism against you? 
 We all do the best we can. There is no reason for the attacks. 
 Your recent criminal cases were Bicycle theft and drunkenness. 
 Do you have the right skills? 
 Göran Wass, Department of Crime. We are searching now for Anton. 
 Tom Aronsson has handled it well. 
 He is a more competent Policeman than you are journalist. 
 My job is to question ... 
 Josefine Well, Josefine... 
 Smile a bit. 
 Very good. 
 Be careful not to fall. 
 I can swim, mamá. 
 I know, but you would get wet. 
 Honey, be careful with your earrings or you will lose them. 
 Josefine? 
 Josefine? 
 Josefine? 
 Josefine! 
 Josefine! 
 Josefine! 
 Josefine!, come back, Josefine. 
 Eva. 
 Hello. Pierre Hedman. 
 I heard your message. Are you in Silverhöjd? 
 Yes, I arrived last night. 
 Excellent. 
 Come, we will read the Will. 
 Can I sign Immediately? 
 Yes, in Theory. 
 The will is in the safe house of Thörnblads Celulosa. Do you have a key? 
 Yes. I want it done as soon as possible. 
 Hello. 
 Hello. I'm sorry. 
 I'm really sorry for your loss. Your father was a good man. 
 Probably, you know it better than me. 
 Eva. 
 Pierre Hedman. Welcome. 
 Did you have a good journey? 
 Yes Want some coffee? Tea? Carbonated water? 
 It's ok, thanks. 
 Maybe you're hungry? I could... 
 I've come to sign a paper, not to live in here. 
 Yes...? 
 Thanks Eva, just wanted to say hello. I'm Gustav Borén, Acting CEO. 
 I remember you. 
 I haven't seen you since you were little. 
 Your father and I worked together for a long time. He spoke highly of you. 
 I'm sorry for your loss. 
 It's a small consolation, but the company is in good hands. 
 We have to talk about what you want to do with your father's interests among other things. 
 But let's wait until you're ready, I'll leave you alone. 
 I want you to feel at home. This is your father's old office. 
 Some of his things are still in boxes. 
 Thanks. 
 I am leaving, bye. 
 Do you have the key? 
 Yes I don't understand. It's empty. 
 Well, it's supposed to be in here. 
 Dad's sick way of telling me that I get nothing. 
 Let me make some calls. 
 Thanks, I know. Your father must have placed it elsewhere. 
 He seemed a little confused lately. 
 What happens now? 
 It's clear that you inherited everything, so legally there's no problem. 
 I have to make a new will and it might take a few days. 
 Ok. Please, let me know when you're finished. 
 Eva! 
 I'm Gerda Gunnarsson. I saw you at the funeral. I'm sorry for your loss. 
 I understand it must be difficult. 
 I was your father's secretary, so we were pretty close. 
 I know exactly how close you were. 
 We hadn't seen each other since he fell ill. 
 No need to explain. 
 How long are you staying? 
 That depends. 
 Don't hesitate to call me if you want to talk. 
 Do you need help with anything? 
 Eh... I looking for something here, maybe you can help me. Where...? 
 Take me to the center. 
 Silverhöjd has, hands down, the tastiest deer in the country Bon appétit. 
 Mmm! 
 Taste it. 
 What did I tell you? good, right? 
 I heard about your father. I'm sorry for your loss. 
 Someone should collect all the expressions of regret some time. 
 By the way, you were not around, and you were not seen for seven years. 
 Not since your daughter disappeared. 
 What do you know about me, anyway? 
 You moved to Silverhöjd when you were 8 years old, then your parents separated. 
 Police Academy from 1999 to 2003. 
 Since 2010 you have worked as a negotiator ... 
 Special force the Stockholm police. 
 And according to rumours, it was you who stole ... the rooster of Jödahls the farmer in the summer of 1986. 
 It was a chicken. I borrowed it. 
 Okay. 
 If the police were not around you would have ask me. 
 I've done my homework. people speech, but something came to my mind. 
 Like what? 
 You are not really here for the funeral. 
 Why am I here? 
 You think Anton has been kidnapped. 
 And it is the same perpetrator who took your daughter seven years ago. 
 What should I do? 
 I will not stop searching. But I have curiosity. 
 Why don't you think she drowned? 
 They found her dress in the pond and no traces that suggest otherwise. 
 A feeling. 
 But what do you say about Anton, he is not lost? 
 He disappeared without a trace at noon. 
 Yes. We have no trace, but it doesn't mean we don't have anything the nurse looked away 3 seconds. 
 She says that, yes. 
 When a child disappears without any trace again, is it a coincidence? 
 Is it a coincidence that your father committed suicide at the same time? 
 He set fire to the barn and shot himself. 
 What's that has got to do with anything? 
 Your theory is crazy. 
 Your daughter has nothing to do with Anton. 
 Do your investigation and I will do mine. 
 But still ... one moment. 
 Wass. When? 
 Well, I'm going straight there. Goodbye. 
 
 
 
 Something happened? 
 Yes, another child is missing. 
 Anton's brother, Oscar, disappeared a few hours ago. 
 Two children from the same family no it isn't a coincidence. Who called? 
 Lina, the babysitter. 
 Wait. How does Oscar look? 
 He is 6 years old, blond, blue eyes. 
 Oscar? 
 Hi Oscar Who are you? 
 My name is Eva. 
 Where are you going? 
 To get my big brother ... 
 But you know, we're looking for you. 
 Why is that? 
 Your dad thinks you're gone like Anton. He is very worried. 
 I'm here. 
 Yes, but they don't know that. 
 Listen ... Let's go home and tell them that you have not gone? 
 Can we look for Anton afterwards? 
 I promise to look for Anton. 
 It ensures track down the house. 
 Yup. 
 Oscar! 
 Where have you been? 
 Where have you found him? 
 In the woods What were you doing, eh? 
 Sorry, Dad. I was looking for Anton. 
 Sorry, son. I was very worried. I thought you also ... 
 Promise that you will not leave. You swear? Go Thank You. 
 Don't thank me, thank Eva. 
 We will contact you as soon as we know something. Do not worry, we'll find him. 
 I have someone I want you to meet. 
 Eva Thörnblad. Tom Aronsson. 
 Hello Thörnblad, I'm sorry for your loss Why didn't you speak to me? 
 I was looking for you, but you were gone. 
 Is it possible that you did't look good? 
 You know I did. Everywhere. 
 I miss you, Mom. 
 I miss you too. 
 Every day I promise to find who took you. 
 Are you going to kill him? 
 Yes ... I will. 
 23. Time News Eko. starting with the local news, Silverhöjd. 
 The police have no trace of Anton ... and address  to the public for clues. 
 The 6 year old boy was seen last time in a park ... 
 Hello? 
 Hello! 
 Hi! f*ck... 
 Hey ... How are you? 
 Hey ... Hello? 
 Josefine? 
 Jose... God! 
 Josefine! 
 Hey, so nice to hear from you. No, of course. 
 I was on holidays. Tenerife. 
 Good weather, I swam, I sunbathed and danced. Can you imagine? 
 There's someone, I have to go. 
 Were you sit there all the time? 
 Yes, I think I was. 
 I waited the whole night. How's the girl? 
 She's unconscious, but apart from it, everything else is stale. 
 Can I see her? 
 Nobody is allowed to visit her. 
 When can I see her? 
 You must leave. 
 Eva? Hello. 
 Tom Aronsson. We met yesterday. 
 How are you? 
 I have to ask you some questions regarding what happened, it will be quick. 
 Let me know if something happens. 
 So she didn't say anything? 
 No. 
 She appeared shocked. 
 Yes, poor girl. Only god knows what she's been through. 
 You haven't been able to identify her yet? 
 No, she doesn't match any of the other cases. 
 I think I know who she is. 
 You do? Who is she then? 
 My daughter. Josefine. 
 Yes... Don't look at me like that, I know how that sounds. 
 I've been wearing this for 7 years. 
 Josefine dropped it before disappearing. 
 The other... is on the ear of that girl. 
 Well... maybe it's a similar earring. 
 The orders are clear. Nobody can see the girl, not even the police. 
 I want to make a DNA test. 
 And if it's Josefine? it's still uncertain if the cases are related. 
 She appears right when Anton Disappears... 
 But, why free her after all this time? 
 Maybe she's too old. 
 Too old? 
 Yes. If he takes kids, I mean. 
 Maybe she's too old, so he swapped her for Anton. 
 Let's wait for the DNA results before jumping to conclusions. 
 The girl could be anybody. 
 Yes. 
 You're right. I just need to have something in order to carry on. 
 We're ready. I'm sending samples to the lab. it will take a couple of days. 
 We will contact you when we have an answer. 
 Thanks. 
 Do you know Olof Gran? 
 No, Who is that? 
 Crazy Gran? 
 Well, he knows everybody. 
 Do you know where to find him? 
 I've seen him by the library. 
 Thanks. 
 Olof Gran? 
 Can't you see I'm busy? 
 Eva Thörnblad. Do you remember me? 
 Yes, I remember. What are you doing here? 
 I want to talk about Josefine's disappearance. 
 She didn't disappear, she drowned. 
 You were one of the few who didn't believe it. What made you change your mind? 
 All the evidence said she drowned. 
 The lake dragged her, but the body wasn't found. What evidence is that? 
 Your daughter drowned in Bläcktjärn. 
 She didn't drown. Someone took her! 
 And now she's back. 
 She's recovering in Silverhöjd's hospital. 
 No. No, this is not good. 
 Why did you come here? 
 Olof... you... 
 Leave! go home and don't come back. Leave Silverhöjd now! 
 Olof! Olof... 
 Take me to Bräckö. 
 Drive, come on! 
 Olof, your book! 
 What's that? 
 Easy, Kuba. 
 You got my number so call me if something happens or if she wakes up. Thanks. 
 Kuba, easy. 
 Aah... 
 Give me a call when you hear this. 
 You have to wear a mask, security reasons We don't know if she carries something. 
 Understood. 
 Come on! 
 sh1t... 
 Voice Mail. Hey, it's Tom Aronsson. 
 The girl is awake, call me when you hear this. 
 Wait here. 
 Does this work? 
 As long as you do what I tell you, I can guarantee the kid's safety. 
 What about Anton, then? 
 His life is in more danger as time passes. 
 You know the requisites. If you go with them, everything is over. 
 We would never do that. 
 Then we will do it my way. 
 But, what happens now? did you find something? 
 One needs time to find what doesn't want to be found. But I got leads. 
 I will let you know. 
 Hello, my name is Tom. I'm with the police. 
 I would like to ask you a few questions. 
 Can you tell me your name? 
 Josefine? 
 Josefine... 
 Hello. 
 What do you think? Can we talk? 
 I have a few pictures that we could see. You can do it, right? 
 If you recognize someone, just point at him, okay? 
 Might I take a look? 
 I'll come back later. 
 Nothing? 
 Hair and dirt, but nothing else. 
 Could it be in the clothes? 
 I checked it with you. No pendant. 
 Sorry We are here, Easy, Easy! 
 Calm down. 
 Give her 20 milligrams of diazepam, Quickly! 
 When did she wake up? 
 Just a moment ago. it can't be entered and we're not going in. 
 I have to show you something. Come on, it's important. 
 So... here you go. 
 Well... you and your father didn't speak in these last few years? 
 He tried, but we didn't have anything to say to each other. 
 I showed her some pictures and she reacted to this. 
 My dad? She tore it apart...? 
 Three people had to restrain her. They had to sedate her. 
 She didn't seem to love your dad. 
 They met once when she was 6. if this girl is Josefine. it's her. Didn't you see the earring? 
 No one has seen any earring. it's Josefine! 
 The lab results will prove it. 
 I don't need any lab results! 
 Eva, wait! 
 Eva, calm down. Talk to me. 
 I understand you're sensitive. 
 Sensitive? You're f*cking crazy. 
 We can't jump to conclusions just yet. 
 No, no, no, Eva! 
 I want to see my daughter! 
 She can't get any visitors. 
 This can't be true. 
 We want to take a look at the farm. 
 Why? 
 To see if something ties the girl with your dad. 
 Dad did a lot of f*ck ups, but that... Stay the f*ck away from the farm! 
 What have you done? 
 There you are, are you okay? 
 You must go to bed. 
 Come.
