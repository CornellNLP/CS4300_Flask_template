 Madeline:  Oh, my goodness. 
Oh! (chuckles)   
 - Ed: Ah, good one, Ziggy. 
-  That was... whoa.   
 Yeah. Get out.   
 - Go, honey, go, go, go. 
-  Bring it on, sister.   
 - Yes! 
- Oh, my gosh. Karate star.    
 Oh!    
 (music continues)   
 (thuds)   
 (no audible dialogue)    
 (doorbell rings)   
 - What? 
-  (gunshot echoes)   
 Madeline:  I should've never Googled him or stirred you up like that.   
 This is my problem in life... I can never let dead dogs lie.    
 Well, but that's the problem. He's not dead.    
 For all we know, he's out there right now assaulting women.    
 Can I ask you, when you went on this little road trip,    
 did you... did you take your gun?    
 - No. 
- You don't sound sure.    
 I didn't take my gun.    
 And had this Saxon Baker been the guy,    
 what would you have done?    
 Were there others?    
 Other Saxons in your Internet search?    
 Listen, you moved to Monterey to start over, to build a future.    
 I suggest you focus on that, not the past.    
 (scoffs)    
 (wind blowing)    
 Perry: You're gonna kill me.    
 I have to go to Phoenix tomorrow morning.    
 I'll be back Thursday night.    
 But it's the play, and it's opening night.    
 Oh...    
 Well, I'll... I'll see it when I get back.    
 It's opening night.    
 Madeline's gonna be so disappointed.    
 It's a whole big thing.    
 I don't want you going to the premiere either.    
 What?    
 Come to Phoenix with me.    
 - Baby... 
- I know "Come to Phoenix with me"    
 isn't the most romantic thing you've ever heard.    
 But we can... we can sneak off to Sedona for a night.    
 No, I can't do that.    
 - Why? 
- Because she will never speak to me again.    
 - It's a big thing for her. 
- Madeline is beginning to piss me off.    
 Oh.    
 How often do we get a chance to sneak away, just the two of us?    
 Look what you're doing.    
 - Look at it. 
- What? What?    
 You're the one who suddenly has to leave    
 and I am the one who disappoints.    
 - I'm just trying to be romantic. 
- (sighs)    
 Huh?    
 Just a little bit romantic here.    
 - Josh:  Mom? 
- Mm?    
 Nathan:  I don't want to.   
 Divorced people are not supposed to be friends,    
 supposed to be civil, or have dinner together, or...    
 You know, it's okay for things to be ugly sometimes.    
 That's, like, life.    
 Got it.    
 Life can be ugly.    
 I'll make a note of that. Thank you.    
 - (chuckles) 
- What you doing?    
 Oh, just puttering around in the garden, honey.    
 Trying to help things grow and evolve.    
 (scoffs) Hey, what have you been doing all day    
 behind your closed door there, locked away?    
 - Working on your secret project? 
- Yeah.    
 Well, it won't be a secret for much longer.    
 My official unveiling is on Wednesday.    
 Wow!    
 You've been working really hard on this.    
 Well, colleges look for passion projects now, you know.    
 It's not just about, like, your GPA and being captain of volleyball.    
 - Finally. 
- Yeah.    
 (wind chimes tinkling)   
 I wanted to say thank you for having the dinner on Tuesday.    
 I know you and Mom don't really get along    
 or, you know, necessarily want to,     
 but the idea that we can all be together sometimes like we used to...     
 is kind of cool.     
 - Night. 
- Bonnie:  Good night, sweetie.   
 Don't. Just cut.     
 Madeline:  I feel like I just opened up a giant can of violent worms.   
 - So, how did you leave it with her? 
-  Well, I tried to diffuse her.   
 Imagine me playing the role of diffuser.   
 I should just stay out of other people's lives.   
 I'll talk to her.     
 -  What could you possibly say? 
- Excuse me?     
 Well, I mean, she can hardly relate to my life.     
 What on earth is she gonna do to identify with yours,     
 which is just a tick north of perfect?     
 (sighs) My life isn't perfect, Madeline.     
 Bad things have happened to me.     
 I do understand the concept.     
 -  I'm sorry. I offended you. 
- (exhales)     
 I can hear it in your voice. Just tell me to go f*ck myself.   
 No, I'm not gonna do that.     
 I just don't think she's a dangerous person.     
 Really? I'm starting to get a little bit worried.   
 I'm gonna have to call you back.     
 Is Perry there?   
 Hello?   
 -  Hello? 
- I'm just gonna have to call you back,     
 - all right? 
 - Okay. Night, honey.   
 Okay.     
 Tell me, baby, what bad things have happened to you.

 Jane:  All right, put it away, babe. We're pulling up.   
 Wait, my favorite part.     
 Ziggy, you can watch it when you get home from school.   
 -  Put it away. 
- Here it is.     
 (knocking on window)   
 - Hey. 
- Hi. Can you come see me?     
 Yeah.     
 There is, evidently, a petition circulating,     
 calling for Ziggy's suspension.     
 His suspension?     
 I am furious about it, as is Mr. Nippal,     
 and we will get it stopped.     
 But in the meantime...     
 Are people actually signing this?     
 Yeah, it seems so.     
 He's six!     
 We don't even know that he's the bully!     
 I know. I just found out about it myself.     
 And we will absolutely handle it.     
 Ziggy will of course not be suspended.     
 Harper:  I'm not ashamed to say I started the petition.   
 The school was doing nothing.     
 That Harper was so far up Renata's ass,     
 she could've chewed her food for her.     
 - I signed the petition. 
- I signed it.     
 - I accidentally signed it. 
- The school was not doing nothing.     
 Ms. Barnes: The petition we will get squashed.     
 I am more concerned...     
 some of the children have been instructed     
 (voices fades) not to play with Ziggy.     
 (electricity humming)   
 (kids chattering)     
 - Are you behind this petition? 
- Excuse me?     
 - I asked you a f*cking question. 
- Gordon: Hey, whoa, whoa.     
 - Calm down. 
- Don't f*cking threaten me.     
 - Was it you? 
- What are you gonna do, huh?     
 Choke me? (scoffs)     
 - Whoa, whoa, whoa, hey! 
- Excuse me!     
 - Don't you...! 
- Stop, stop!     
 - Ow! Oh, my God, my eye! 
- What the hell is wrong with you?!     
 If they had any sense, they would've canceled     
 Trivia Night right then and there.     
 I had actually planned on skipping Trivia Night     
 until the eye gouging.     
 I should've taken that job in Reykjavik.     
 I'm gonna sue you!     
 - Ugh. 
- Is her eye okay?     
 Apparently. (scoffs)     
 She'll be fine.     
 I need to get out of this town as soon as possible.     
 Hold on a second.     
 Ziggy is very well-liked.     
 Chloe says he's popular.     
 Even Amabella plays with him.     
 This is about the parents,     
 and I'm not gonna have you bulldozed out of Monterey.     
 - Neither will I, for what it's worth. 
- Exactly.     
 - Thank you. 
- (chuckles) Thank you.     
 Thanks.     
 A lot of parents are probably applauding you right now.     
 There's more than one person in this town that wants to deck Renata Klein,     
 yours truly included.     
 I actually think this is a good thing.     
 It's high time that people know they shouldn't f*ck with Jane Chapman.     
 And they're not gonna mess with your kid either.     
 I had my gun.     
 What?     
 I had my gun in my purse     
 when I went to San Luis Obispo.     
 I don't think I would've shot him, but I had it.     
 (sniffles)     
 Okay.     
 Well, I'm not gonna lie.     
 That gives me pause.     
 Yeah, it gives me pause, too.     
 Like, I think I'm going insane. (sniffles)     
 Like, I still hope     
 that whoever he is is a nice guy.     
 That, like, maybe that night was just a bad misunderstanding,     
 or a night gone wrong, or he had a bad day,     
 or his parents got in a car crash.     
 I, like, make up these crazy excuses     
 because I'm so desperate to believe that Ziggy's father is actually a good person.     
 (Celeste exhales) Well, he's been very, um...   
 (sucks teeth) affectionate.     
 Very clingy.     
 Which usually means he's feeling insecure.     
 Or, um...     
 Or what?     
 Or it means I have the power.     
 Sometimes he has it, sometimes I have it.     
 It's like a seesaw.     
 When do you get the power?     
 After he hits you?     
 Yeah. When he hurts me, I get the upper hand.     
 The more he hurts me, the higher I go,     
 the longer I stay, until...     
 He's been, um... (clears throat)     
 very loving... (chuckles)     
 the last few days.     
 But at some point, he gets the power back.     
 Mm. Usually when...     
 when my bruises fade and...     
 and he doesn't feel as guilty,     
 he feels insecure.     
 And then it all happens again.     
 Where is he now?     
 He's in Phoenix. He left this morning.     
 When are you gonna leave him, Celeste?     
 (scoffs)     
 When he hurts you badly enough?     
 When...  he hurts the children?     
 - He will never hurt the children... 
- You need to rent an apartment.     
 Locally,     
 if you don't want to disrupt the boys' school.     
 Whoa. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.     
 We're getting way ahead of ourselves here.     
 No, I don't think so.     
 Stock the refrigerator.     
 Make sure the utilities are paid for.     
 Have the beds set up for the kids.     
 Get it all ready so we can at least remove     
 "Where on God's earth would I go?" from the equation.     
 You'll have a place,     
 a mindset, another life standing by     
 should you need it.     
 Which...     
 we both know you will.     
 I don't think a therapist should be this, um...     
 I don't think you should be behaving like this.     
 I'll get you the number of the Better Business Bureau and you can report me.     
 In the meantime, start documenting the abuse.     
 Write everything down.     
 Photograph your injuries. Keep doctor reports.     
 That could be important in a custody battle.     
 And men like your husband typically do go for custody.     
 He has the resources, the money, the contacts.     
 Most importantly...     
 he has the ego to see this through.     
 I don't understand why you're being such an alarmist right now...     
 Because I'm alarmed.     
 Have you told anybody else about the abuse?     
 No.     
 - Why not? 
- I don't know.     
 If you were to guess.     
 (scoffs)     
 Perhaps my self-worth     
 is made up of how other people see me.     
 (chuckles)     
 I'm sorry. I... I'm just amazed     
 by patients who can harbor such profound self-awareness     
 underneath the hard shell of denial.     
 Find a friend to confide in.     
 Do it today.     
 (sighs) Because?     
 Because if there is a custody battle,     
 you know what Perry's lawyer will be asking...     
 "Did you ever tell anybody, Mrs. Wright?     
 Hmm?     
 Really? You told nobody at all?     
 Is that because it never really happened?     
 And you're just making all this up to win custody?     
 In fact, you've repeatedly maintained     
 what a wonderful husband and father Perry is.     
 Haven't you, Mrs. Wright?     
 Nobody's ever witnessed this alleged abuse, ever.     
 Isn't that true, Mrs. Wright?     
 We only have your word. You said he was wonderful.     
 Now you say he's a monster.     
 Were you lying then or are you lying now?"     
 You're a lawyer.     
 You know how important it is to have a witness.     
 - Hello. 
- Hey. Juliette, right?     
 - Renata: What do you want? 
- Do you want...     
 Uh...     
 I... I just wanted to say that I'm so sorry.     
 I completely lost control and I stepped out of line,     
 and I should have never shoved you like that.     
 There's no excuses and I'm so sorry.     
 Yeah.     
 The truth is is I finally realized     
 that I've been feeling exactly what you must be feeling.     
 There's nothing worse than your child being victimized, right?     
 So, I understand and completely empathize     
 with what you're going through.     
 I am as sure as any parent can be that Ziggy is innocent.     
 I took him to a child psychologist and she examined him     
 and tested him and said that he was a gentle young boy     
 who's completely incapable of doing what he's been accused of.     
 Renata, I am at my wit's end.     
 I don't know what to do anymore.     
 Does Amabella still say that he's hurting her?     
 No. She, uh...     
 says he's a sweet boy.     
 And orientation?     
 Well, she hasn't taken back the accusation, but...     
 she refuses to talk to us about anything further.     
 You think you're at your wit's end.     
 My daughter is the one getting hurt     
 and I can't stop it.     
 (softly) I'm so sorry.     
 Me, too.     
 Thank you.     
 Thank you.     
 Yeah, my baby lost another baby tooth.     
 - I put it under my pillow. 
- Good.     
 There is no tooth fairy, idiot. It's Mom and Dad.     
 - Would you please get me a tissue? 
- Is it bleeding?     
 No, not a lot.     
 (growling)     
 - Are there any bad teenagers in here? 
- Twins: Dad!     
 - What are you doing here? 
- (laughs) Hey, boys.     
 (twins giggling)     
 Don't we have a premiere to attend tonight?     
 You made it back for the play?     
 I wouldn't miss it for the world.     
 You did that for me?     
 Yeah. Of course.     
 Thank you.     
 Wow! Kazowie!     
 (laughs) Did you say "kazowie"?     
 - I did. You look fantastic. 
- Thank you, honey.     
 - What, you got a big date or something? 
- As a matter of fact, I do.     
 - A very big date. 
- Oh.     
 - Congrats on your opening night. 
- Aw.     
 Thank you, honey.     
 I don't really have anything to do with it anymore.     
 You have a huge amount to do with it.     
 It wouldn't even be happening but for you. Are you kidding?     
 - Let's go. 
- Okay.     
 (guitar playing)   
 How do I look?     
 - You look nice. 
- Thank you.     
 Remember, you're not allowed to sing that one.     
 - Okay. 
- You can play it, but you can't sing it.     
 - Why can't I go to the play? 
- It's not really for kids.     
 - I like puppets. 
- I know you do.     
 Is it because the puppets have s*x?     
 - Who told you that? 
- Chloe.     
 She said the boy puppet puts his pen1s in the girl puppet.     
 (stammering) Chloe said that?     
 Yeah, it's icky.     
 Sometimes...     
 magic comes from icky, Ziggy.     
 - Woman:  Hey. 
- That's a longer conversation, though.     
 - Hi. 
- How's my little champion?     
 - Awesome. 
- Yeah?     
 - You learn some more chords this week? 
- Yeah.     
 Yeah, you always do. (laughs)     
 - Hi! 
- Thank you so much.     
 - No problem. 
- I won't be gone too long.     
 - Give me a kiss. 
- (strums guitar)     
 (sighs)     
 - You look amazing. 
- Mm.     
 Thank you.     
 Beautiful dress.     
 We're gonna be late.     
 Stop.     
 Don't do that.     
 - What, this? 
- Yeah.     
 I thought you liked when I did that.     
 - Just, come on. 
- What?     
 - Get ready. 
- We can be a little late.     
 No, we can't.     
 Well, I'm just very excited to see you.     
 To be home with my beautiful wife.     
 (zipper unzips)   
 Oh. Yeah, I can feel that.     
 Yeah, you can feel that?     
 (both breathing heavily)     
 God, that's quite a trick.     
 - It is quite a trick. 
- Mm-hmm.     
 Come on, baby, please get ready. We've got to go.     
 - Calm down, I just want... 
- Please, this is important.     
 - We've got to go. 
- What... hey, what is this?     
 - Really, stop it. 
- What's wrong?     
 What did you do, take a pill or something?     
 No, of course I didn't take a pill.     
 You're actually capable of arousing me without medication, Celeste.     
 - You're being ridiculous. 
- I... huh?     
 - (yelps) 
- Is this being ridiculous? What?     
 - (thuds) 
- Aah!     
 - (groaning) 
- sh1t.

 - Okay, I'll see you tomorrow. 
- Yes.     
 - Congratulations. 
- Oh, Stu. Thanks for coming.     
 - Hey, congrats. 
- Hey, guys. How's it going?     
 - Maddie, congratulations. 
- Oh, thank you.     
 - Amazing. 
- That is a good idea.     
 - I'm gonna get us some drinks. 
- Okay.     
 That was really great.     
 - I'm not a huge fan of Muppets, but... 
- Right.     
 - Um, where'd Abby go? 
- She rushed out.     
 She told me to tell you she loved it.     
 Oh. What's she rushing out to do?     
 - It's the whole project, secret project. 
- Project.     
 Nathan:  Seems to be all-consuming.   
 Well, I'm gonna join Ed.     
 - Yeah, of course. 
- Thank you for coming.     
 - Oh, yeah. It was amazing. 
- Yeah.     
 - I'm gonna call Celeste. 
- Yeah, just let me know.     
 - Madeline. 
- Hi, Tori. Hello.     
 - Congratulations. 
- Thank you.     
 And to you, too. Joseph was great.     
 And I feel like it went really well.     
 - Was it you? 
- I'm sorry?     
 Are you the woman Joseph is in love with?     
 I... I don't know what you're talking about.     
 I know he had an affair a year ago.     
 I can tell when he lies.     
 - Okay... 
- He also...     
 told me he was over her.     
 Which...     
 I can tell when he lies.     
 Was it you?     
 I'm happily married.     
 I'm just friends with Joseph.     
 I would never do that.     
 What were you doing in his car?     
 (turn signal ticking)   
 Ed:  You're kind of quiet.   
 Oh, I'm just...     
 reflecting on all of it.     
 Big night. You'd think you'd be bubbling over a bit with pride.     
 - You should be. 
- Thanks, honey.     
 I don't know, for some reason     
 I'm just thinking about this dinner with Bonnie and Nathan.     
 I'm just kind of dreading it.     
 - It'll be fine. 
-  Yeah.   
 (phone buzzing)     
 Finally.     
 She better have a good reason.     
 Where were you?     
 What?     
 - A broken urethra. 
- I know!     
 - Can you even imagine? 
- Wow.     
 Chloe, it's time to go to bed, honey.     
 - Give me   ! 
- No, time for bed right now.     
 (vocalizing)     
 Chloe, now.     
 Seven, final offer.     
 I said now.     
 - Good night, sweetie. 
- Good night.     
 - Mwah. 
- Love you.     
 Love you, too.     
 - Night, honeycake. 
- Love you.     
 I love you, too.     
 (whispers) So, it... it happened during...   
 I mean, talk about wild s*x.     
 Can you imagine being in the hospital?     
 - (laughs) 
- I mean, how embarrassing!     
 I just can't imagine the passion it would take     
 to shatter a urethra in two places.     
 You sound a little envious.     
 - Do you want me to smash yours? 
- (laughs)     
 Well, not smash, but, you know.     
 - (laughs) 
- Yeah, we never have wild s*x.     
 I mean, we have nice s*x.     
 I like it, but, you know,     
 it usually times out between four and six minutes,     
 and neither of us are in any remote danger of physical injury.     
 - Well, that's just kind of mean, Ed. 
- Sorry.     
 I mean, maybe I am envious, you know?     
 I mean, what, Perry walks through the door and, whoosh!     
 I wish we had that kind of desire.     
 Well, by "we" you mean me.     
 Okay, you're a fiery person.     
 Which makes your tepidness for me     
 just more conspicuous.     
 I don't mean to punish you...     
 Well, I mean, it feels like you are.     
 I tell myself all the time, like, married people, you know,     
 after a while they reach this...     
 sexual plateau, and that's the norm.     
 Then I hear about other couples, you know,     
 breaking urethras, and...     
 Well, it's hardly like you're some sort of raging bull, Ed.     
 The only time you touch me is when you're reaching across me to get the Visine for...     
 That's because you don't want it, Madeline.     
 We never talk about that because that would make it     
 harder to pretend.     
 And sometimes that's the... the essence of a happy marriage, isn't it?     
 The ability to pretend.     
 In the days leading up to Trivia Night,     
 it just seemed more and more people wanted to kill each other.     
 It was hard to keep track.

 They said he's pretty good, so...     
 I'm gonna kick his ass.     
 I'm just... what? I'm inspired by the whole play thing.     
 And besides, I'm sick and tired of his little f*cking digs,     
 like he's the cultural sh1t or something.     
 I'm gonna show him who's evolved.

 But friction between Ed and I is fine.     
 First of all, I'm very disappointed in your attitude.     
 And second, and more importantly,     
 we have a bigger problem.     
 Abigail's secret project.     
 Yeah? What about it?     
 She is auctioning off her virginity on the Internet.     
 For Amnesty International, so it is for a very good cause.     
 (clears throat) She's selling her virginity on the Internet?     
 Good cause?     
 Nathan:  Abigail!   
 You smoking?     
 Just for tonight.     
 It's been    years. Why not?     
 So, you think our marriage is pretend?     
 No, I said that in every marriage     
 there is pretending.     
 Even the best ones.     
 You said it was the essence, if I heard you correctly.     
 I mean, I don't pretend to love you.     
 I know you don't pretend to love me.     
 But what I do like to pretend, as do you,     
 is that I'm all that.     
 So, is this back to the "Steady Eddie" theme?     
 - Okay. 
- Is that what we're talking about?     
 No, Madeline, I'm the lucky one.     
 I get to wake up every day next to the girl of my dreams.     
 That makes me the winner.     
 I just feel like the loser sometimes.     
 I know I haven't always been the best wife.     
 And I'm really sorry.     
 I get angry sometimes and...     
 - I made a mistake. 
- Unh-unh. Shh.     
 I made a terrible mistake.     
 Don't say that.     
 Nathan:  What the f*ck!   
 You're selling your virginity?     
 Yeah, I thought you'd be proud of me.     
 Proud of you?     
 Yeah. A lot of girls lose their virginity for a lot less...     
 - So you're selling yourself? 
- At a worthy price, for a worthy cause!     
 Don't try to tell me that s*x     
 - That is prostitution! 
- isn't a form of currency!     
 Women are exploited all the time!     
 Let's make sure everyone feels heard here. Let's have a conversation.     
 Wait, is this thing set up live? Is it already up?     
 (stammers) No, not y...     
 Where are you going?     
 - Dad! 
- Guys!     
 - Stop! 
- Come on!     
 - Where is it? 
- You're being crazy!     
 - No, no. You're not taking that. 
- Are you serious?     
 You're not taking that! No, until you tell me you shut it down...     
 - Stop it! 
- I'm not shutting it down!     
 Get off! Get off!     
 - (all shouting) 
- Give my computer back!     
 (shrieking)     
 Oh, sweetie. Hi. It's okay.     
 Skye:  Stop it!   
 (sobbing)   
 (sobbing continues)   
 (door opens)   
 Hi.     
 How are the boys?     
 Oh, they're fine. Sound asleep.     
 Perry: Thank you for staying late.     
 You can go now.     
 You can go now, Kelly.     
 Celeste:  We're fine.   
 - I hope you feel better. 
- Thank you.     
 Good night.     
 -  (door closes) 
- I'm gonna get you some ice.     
 You're lucky I didn't kill you.     
 What did you say?     
 You could have done permanent damage.     
 So, the spermatozoa fertilizes the egg.     
 Women lay eggs?     
 (laughs) No, women have eggs inside of them,     
 in their bellies.     
 So, the sperm fertilize the egg in there,     
 and out of that comes the baby.     
 So, you wanted a baby and my dad "ferlitized" you?     
 - Fertilized. 
- Fertilized you?     
 (laughs) Something like that, yeah.     
 What do you mean, "Something like that"?     
 "Exactly like that." You're too smart for me.     
 Where is he?     
 I don't know, baby.     
 (keys clicking)     
 (cereal pouring)   
 
 
 
 - (twins crunching) 
-  (seagulls screeching)   
 Have you spoken to her?     
 No.     
 Are you going to?     
 - Nathan:  Hey, honey? 
- I'm running late.     
 Um, hey, just... just take a second, please?     
 Listen, I think the idea behind what you're doing, it's extremely noble.     
 What other   -year-old even has a social conscience, you know?     
 So, I'm proud of you. I'm very proud.     
 But I think that there are other ways     
 to accomplish your goals.     
 Dad, come on.     
 A   -year-old white girl from Monterey     
 selling her virginity online?     
 Wolf Blitzer would saddle that up for weeks.     
 That's the way.     
 Bonnie:  Abby.   
 Thanks.     
 - I blame you for that. 
- Me?     
 Yeah, you taught her to care about everything and it's just rubbed off on her.     
 Oh, come on.     
 "Wolf Blitzer's gonna saddle that up"?     
 (scoffs)     
 You know, Madeline's so gonna blame me for this.     
 - No, she's not. 
- Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.     
 She will.     
 I can't believe you're eating that sh1t.     
 Oh, yeah?

 Ed:  Dinner's here, honey.   
 Jane: A playdate? Really?     
 Well, we could keep a watchful eye on them,     
 which the teacher and an assistant     
 can't do, really, with    kids.     
 Are you still convinced that Ziggy's the culprit?     
 I don't know, with everything you said.     
 Which is why if I schedule playdates     
 with each and every child in the class,     
 I can eliminate suspects one by one.     
 You're gonna schedule a playdate between     
 Chloe Mackenzie and Amabella?     
 (laughs) If that psycho would allow it.     
 Sorry, poor form.     
 I know you're friends with Madeline.     
 - It's all good. 
- Hey!     
 Hey.     
 - Everything okay here? 
-  Everything's great.   
 So nice of you to ask, Harper.     
 You know, schools should set up special commendations     
 for gestures like that.     
 Maybe I'll start a petition.     
 (Renata laughs) A petition.   
 Touché. All right, I'm going to work, girls.     
 - See you later. 
- Bye.     
 We just want our children to be safe, that's all.     
 Of course we do. It takes a village.   
 Got to have each other's backs, right?     
 Who's got yours?     
 Samantha:  There was this rumor whipping around   
 that Jane and Renata had settled their differences.     
 I never bought it.     
 I believe women are chemically incapable of forgiveness.     
 (seagulls screeching)   
 It's pretty, huh?     
 (sighs)     
 Okay, so this is our two bedroom, two bath.     
 Mm-hmm.     
 You know, some of the units come furnished,     
 but, personally, I think the decor is hideous.     
 - (chuckles) 
- And they're on the ground floor,     
 so you don't get this view.     
 No, unfurnished is fine.     
 It's definitely on the Monterey City limits?     
 Yeah. We're southwest Monterey.     
 Ah.     
 And it's available now?     
 You can move in tomorrow.     
 - A beautiful sunset. 
- Mm.     
 Do you think I'd be able to come back a little later     
 and spend some time here by myself?     
 - Yeah, I... 
- (chuckles) Probably sounds weird.     
 No, it doesn't sound weird. I mean, it's possibly where you'll be living, right?     
 I'm just gonna leave you the key and I'll clear it with the office.     
 - And just take as much time as you need. 
- That's amazing.     
 - Thank you. 
- Just call me tomorrow. Let me know.     
 (exhales)     
 (music playing)   
 Ed: If you feel yourself getting angry,     
 just remember it's all about getting along for Abigail's sake.     
 I'm gonna be fine.     
 I took a little something.     
 Just a half.

 - Thank you. 
- Bonnie, I love this music.     
 - Is this Adele? 
- Uh, no. It's Sade, actually.     
 - We should get this, honey. 
- Oh, we have it.     
 Bonnie:  Red wine, anyone?   
 I know white goes with fish, but I like red.     
 Yes, please.     
 Oh! (chuckles) Down the hatch.     
 Madeline:  I love this place setting.   
 I like when there's extra forks and extra spoons,     
 especially little, tiny forks.     
 - (chuckles) 
-  It feels so special, doesn't it?   
 - I just want to use all of them. 
- (chuckles)     
 The, uh... the little ones are for the oysters.     
 And I love these really creative little cups.     
 They're clay. I think they're from Mexico.     
 - Yeah. 
-  Oh, that's so nice.   
 Ed prefers more traditional glass.     
 Perhaps for wine, but these are...     
 I'm actually more kind of a beer guy, but...     
 Oh, do you want some beer? We have some.     
 - Oh, no, no, no! 
- Are you sure?     
 - Sit down. 
- Since we're talking about wine glasses,     
 let's have a toast!     
 - Toast. 
- Yes, toast.     
 Toast. The, uh...     
 To, um... for...     
 I should make a toast.     
 Bonnie:  Please.   
 To Nathan and Bonnie.     
 - Because I heard... 
- And none of us killing each other.     
 - (chuckles) Yeah, right. 
- All right.     
 - (all laughing) 
- I'm just kidding.     
 You're so funny.     
 All right. This is yummy wine.     
 - Bonnie:  Mm, isn't it? 
- It's really good.     
 Is Abigail gonna join us for dinner?     
 She'll be down for dessert.     
 She said she can only be stuck with the grown-ups for so long.     
 Yeah.     
 I think she's just wanting us to have some bonding time.     
 Teenagers. Oh, she's been probably working on her secret project.     
 Mm.     
 I'm so curious.     
 Do you guys know what that is?     
 - Mm-hmm. 
- Yeah, we just found out what it is, yeah.     
 No way.     
 Do tell.     
 Baby? (clears throat)     
 It's unconventional. It's even a little radical.     
 - Good. 
- Listen,     
 when I first heard about it, I overreacted.     
 And I'm just gonna caution you guys to take a breath.     
 Process it before jumping to a judgement.     
 Okay, can you just tell us what it is?     
 (clears throat)     
 It's... well, she's attempting to raise money for Amnesty International.     
 - All right. 
- She showed me her website.     
 It's, like, very professionally done.     
 I... Abigail is...     
 auctioning off her virginity     
 in order to raise money to protest s*x slavery.     
 - What? 
- Yes.     
 (scoffs) Very funny.     
 No, I'm being serious.     
 She said if a seven-year-old can be sold to s*x slavery,     
 then no one would bat an eye     
 if a white, rich American girl would sell hers online.     
 - This is for real? 
- Look, it's not gone live yet.     
 And we have no intention of letting that happen obviously.     
 - Of course not, no. 
- Nathan, if this is some sort of joke...     
 Yeah, this is not funny, Nathan.     
 - Bonnie:  Okay. 
- (scoffs)     
 It's... it's shocking.     
 And a bit disturbing.     
 But I think it is important     
 that we... we separate the nobility of the cause     
 from the misguided means of pursuing it, you know?     
 We... we champion the former     
 and dissuade her from the latter, right?     
 - (vomiting) 
- Oh!     
 Oh, honey! Are you okay?     
 That's okay. That's okay, that's okay.     
 - (coughing) 
- That's a human reaction.     
 That's completely... baby, get her... thank you.     
 - You okay, honey? 
- No, I'm not.     
 - Oh, my God! 
- Oh, honey!     
 - Honey! 
- Okay.     
 Thank you, thank you. That's all right.     
 - Here. 
- Oh, my God.     
 - That's all right. 
- All right.     
 This is how you parent, Nathan?     
 She's been under your roof for two minutes     
 and now she's some sort of prostitute?     
 - Did I tell ya? 
- Great parenting!     
 All right, let's all just settle for a minute, okay?     
 Please. Let's just settle.     
 Let's remember that we are living in the time of...     
 of Facebook and reality...     
 Oh, God damn it!     
 Oh, my...     
 - sh1t! 
- It's the shrimp.     
 I had heard that Abigail was a little slutty.     
 Knowing the mother, I wouldn't be surprised.     
 (TV playing)   
 Bye, guys.     
 - Bye. 
- Where are you going?     
 Out for dinner with Jane.     
 (chatter on TV)   
 That's enough.     
 Abigail.     
 (birds chirping)   
 You're done with dinner already?     
 Look, I don't even know where to begin about this,     
 so I'm just gonna go straight to the end.     
 This is wrong, Abigail.     
 Completely wrong.     
 And I salute your cause. I really do.     
 But... but what?     
 Saluting a cause, recognizing a problem, isn't enough.     
 A person has to do something.     
 Well, this something is not that, honey.     
 - What about your play? 
- What about my play?     
 You said it spoke to you because it was about     
 finding a purpose in life, which I get.     
 Making your mark. I get that.   
 You're the one who always said a person's life needs to matter.     
 - Okay... 
- Was it all just bullshit?     
 No, it's not.     
 And I'm not gonna give you some long song and dance     
 about how precious and sacred your beautiful body is.     
 - Mm-hmm. 
- But it is not for sale, Abigail.     
 Not ever.     
 No matter what cause, no matter what cost.     
 And one day, you are going to look back at this...     
 probably pretty soon... and think,     
 "What the f*ck was I thinking?     
 Why was I gonna f*ck up my life like that?"     
 Must be nice to be so right.     
 - I'm not right! 
-  So perfect.   
 I'm not f*cking perfect!     
 You think you know me so well?     
 I f*ck up, too. I make mistakes.     
 I've made mistakes bigger than this.     
 Last year, I cheated on Ed.     
 I ended it very quickly, but...     
 The two things I value most in this life     
 are my kids and my marriage.     
 And I risked destroying both of them.     
 Just because I was...     
 selfish or...     
 So don't... don't tell me I'm perfect, okay?     
 I know about f*cking up.     
 And f*cking up doesn't make your dad and I get back together.     
 f*cking up doesn't fix your life.     
 Okay?     
 At least what you were gonna do was for a good cause, and...     
 I was just being selfish.     
 Do you still love Ed?
