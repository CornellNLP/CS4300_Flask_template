I'm gonna have to tie a bell around your neck so you don't keep sneaking up on me. What do you look at in the ocean? Oh, nothing. You spend a lot of time staring at nothing. Okay, I take it back. It's something. It's the big out there. The ocean is powerful. Mostly it's vast. It's full of life, mystery. Who knows what lies out there beneath the surface? Chloe :  Monsters? Monsters? Maybe. Dreams. Sunken treasure. It's the great unknown. That's what the ocean is. Ziggy :  I don't wanna go, Mom. I know you don't, but you have to. It's gonna be fine. But they all think I choked that girl. Yeah, but you know that you didn't and I know that you didn't. It's good enough for me; it should be good enough for you. It's gonna be good enough for everyone else, too. What's our mantra? Every day we're gonna be... Brave. We're gonna be so brave. Good job. Let's go. Mom, why did we move here? (sighs) Ziggy. Okay. I don't have time for this this morning. Please put your shirt on. Why did we move here? Why? That's enough. You can finish that in the car. Let's go. (music playing) I don't mean to do your job, but it begs the question... is she running from something? You cannot be serious, Joseph. ♪ What have you done, my brother? ♪ What? (music continues) No. No. This makes us look like cowards. If you roll over on this, it sets a precedent... Joseph :  He basically laughed. Do not yell at me. You're the one... honey, can you turn that down, please? Do you understand the precedent that you'd be setting? (volume decreases) Don't yell at me. You know what? I'm a lady and I've never said this to anybody, ever, in my entire life, but I'm gonna say it to you. You can go f*ck yourself on the head. Right on the head? I'm sorry, but he's trying to shut down "Avenue Q." He says it's too controversial. Well, what's he want to replace it with? Don't tell me "Cats." (music playing on tablet) ♪ Timmy is an average kid that no one understands ♪ 
♪ Mom and Dad and Vicky always giving him commands... ♪ You remember your first day of school? I do, actually. I got asked out on a date by a second-grader, no less. Perry :  Did we accept? He wore white Docksiders. (chuckles) I'm sorry about last night. The idea of a bully in the class... Celeste :  I don't think he's a bully, but you're probably right. We should err on the side of safety. Mm. I wish I didn't have to fly out tonight. I was thinking when you get back from Vienna, maybe we could see another counselor. (cartoon continues) Yeah. I think it's a good idea. This is gonna be a really good year for us, Sparkles. Cosmo :  We'll just go away forever. Timmy : Why? Wanda :  That's what the rule book says. Oops. Perry : Oh, wow. (whistle trills) Bit of a line here. (horn honks) Oh, it'll move quickly. We just drop and go. They've got it down to a science. Josh : Water, water, water. Oh, we don't go in? No, we just drop them off. They can't be bothered with the parents now. What, so we don't get to meet the teachers? We did all that yesterday at orientation. No. They go right into class today. Don't you? Hmm? Big boys. Max :  Uh-huh. Whoa. (scoffs) Well, that... (Josh gasps) Max, look what the witch gives me. Max :  Whoa! That's not something you could've mentioned? We discussed it. Max :  Hey! School time. You could've told me that Orientation Day was... Don't. (kids chattering) Chloe : We may have assigned seats. If not, you can plop down right next to me. Hi, Skye. (whistle trills) Chloe : This is my friend, Ziggy. Skye : Hi. Chloe : We're half-sisters, sort of. My mom was married to her dad. Hi, Chloe. (car approaches) Hey, mama bear. Hi. I'm going to yoga class. You wanna join me? I would love to, but I have a job interview. Oh, wow. Don't worry about him, honey. He's gonna be fine. I promise. (horn honks) Get laid, bitch. (scoffs) See you later. Gabrielle :  Maybe it was inappropriate, handing out invites  on the first day, but Renata's a planner. Renata was sending a message. (gong rings) (exhaling) (whispering) I was thinking you could do it. I don't practice anymore. I can't. I know, but you could come out of retirement just this one time so you can safeguard all of the arts for Monterey. Plus hear me out. I would be your only client. And how fun would that be to have drinks with the client? Yoga is a time for quiet reflection. Uh, yeah. I know. I don't like to be touched. Okay, breathe into it. Okay. There you go. (gasps) Back corner. Hmm? Oh, you've got to be kidding me. Woman : Shh! Don't shush me. Ugh, she has her own yoga studio. What's she even doing here? (louder) Shh! Okay! We do have a session where the rules are more relaxed, you know? Our perimenopausal class. That won't be necessary. I won't be coming back. Okay, you will never believe what she just said to me. What? Here. What? No, here. (chuckles) You're so pretty when you're mad. Please don't post that on Facebook. Ed will kill me. Nathan : Hey, Maddie. Hey, Celeste. How amazing was that class? Hi, guys! Hi. Nathan. Yoga, wow. Yeah. Bonnie got me into it. Yeah, well, you know, gotta sweat out all those toxins. We drank, like, a bottle of wine last night. And today I was like, "We are going to yoga." You know, I got Abby to sign up for one of my piloxing classes. That's... fantastic. Oh, I'm gonna call again about that petition thing. I mean, it's ridiculous. Oh, you don't need to worry about that. But they should be able to just take my name off. I mean... Nothing's gonna stop us, honey. Jackie :  Ticking bomb. I'll leave it at that. Tick-tick-tick. Could she put a shirt on? (laughing) Boom. Our very first project will be for each of you to do a family tree, where you get to talk about your wonderful family. Isn't that great? But before that, I am going to introduce you to a very, very special friend to our class. This... is Harry the Hippo. (laughs) Now, Harry here has been a beloved member of the first grade for almost 10 years! Now, I know you're not in kindergarten anymore, and you're about to find out that the transition to first grade is not always easy. But with Harry here, you won't even notice it. I promise. And the best part... you will all have your turn to take Harry home for sleepovers. (kids cheering) Ms. Barnes :  Now I'm gonna start off our day  by passing Harry around so you can all greet him with a hug. Okay? Here you go, Billy. Yes. Does Harry want to be hugged? Why, yes. Harry loves hugs. Gabrielle :  I mean, look, let's face it. Amabella picked that Ziggy out of a lineup The kid was off. I'll leave it at that. I thought your flight was at 5:00. Well, traffic might be bad. It's 11:30. Thank you. Good to know. Are you serious? I changed my flight so I could be here on their first day of school. And then I don't even get to go in the building. I understand, but I just... And for you to just dismiss my being upset about it? I didn't dismiss anything. I just don't want to be blamed... Yeah, you know what I think? You didn't want me to be there for orientation. What? You decided to have that moment all to yourself. Mommy and her boys. You're such a child. (gasps) Oh! (whispering) I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Don't. No. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry, honey. f*ck. Hey, hey... Hey, hey, hey. Sorry. It's just... f*ck. I'm sorry. You know, all... it's just all this traveling... I feel like I'm missing out on so much. They'll be grown one day, and I just... (kissing) Sorry. Sorry, sorry. I'm so sorry. Huh? Hey, hey, hey, hey. (groaning) I love you. No, no, no, no. (breathing heavily) There you go. Huh? Let me go. (moaning) Yeah. Ah! (Perry moans) Yeah! (moaning) (grunting) (cries out) Oh, God! Oh! (grunting) (both moaning, panting) Bernard :  Perry and Celeste? Honestly... I'd sleep with either. (seagulls screeching) Renata :  Call "The Wall Street Journal"  and tell them we make a deal now with these guys, or they're never gonna have anybody by them. No, this is ridiculous! Juliette? (stammering) Because my daughter's got to get picked up. Sorry, I'm distra... yes. You need to get in the car right now and pick up... hold on one second. I thought you were picking her up. No, I'm doing an interview here! (whistle trills) Madeline : Turns out it's actually harder to have a part-time job versus a full-time job because in addition to doing all that work, you're out there scouring for another job. Jane : Are you looking for another job? (whistle trills) Madeline : I only do 20 hours a week max. Between you and I, I try to maintain my full-time-mommy status so I can lord it over women like Renata and the other career mommies. Oh, there they are! Our future world leaders! Do you see mine? Yeah. Chloe! (whistle trills) Ma'am, please? What, I can't call for my own daughter? Please reboard the vehicle, ma'am. Chloe : You causing trouble, woman? Get in the car. And don't ever blow your whistle at me again. You're new here. I'm not. Ziggy : Mommy! Jane : Hi, baby! (chuckling) So, how was your first day? Fine. We got to meet Harry the Hippo. Jane :  And, Zig? Ziggy :  Good. Jane : Yeah? Teacher's nice. She is? Oh, that's amazing. That's so great. What's that? Oh, Amabella's having a party. That's sweet. I didn't get invited. Honey, you don't know her very well. You don't know her at all. Madeline : This is about that stupid accusation. It's fine. (mouthing) Was she the only one? Okay, what are we listening to? Feces is never terribly far from Madeline's fan. And the whole party thing created a vortex. Outrageous is what it is. For the whole class to be invited with the exception of Ziggy? I mean, come on. Oh, is he the kid who, uh...? Will you please? What? (music blaring) Chloe. Abby, come on. Madeline :  This is so Renata. (volume decreases) On the very first day of school? Well, if she's convinced that this Ziggy poses a threat to her daughter's safety, of course he's not gonna get invited. I'm just saying that distributing the invitations in the classroom to the exception of one person... I mean, it's just unacceptable. Thank you, honey. This looks delicious. Abby, are you dating the fridge? Mm, Chloe, I set up a standing playdate with you and Ziggy on Thursdays. Cool. Are you sure that's a good idea? Why would it not be? We don't know for a fact that he's innocent. Maybe the benefit of the doubt should run in Chloe's favor instead of Ziggy. Are you suggesting I might be putting my daughter in harm's way? Oh, you mean our daughter? Chloe, I don't know why you didn't text me or call me when the snub happened. I might've been able to intervene. Ed :  How would she call you? She has a phone in her doll. Don't start with me right now. It's just for emergencies. Abigail : You really shouldn't encourage her to play with dolls. And why is that, exactly? It's a little 1960s, not to mention sexist. Is it a Barbie doll? You can't put a phone in a Barbie, dummy. Madeline : Chloe! Barbies aren't allowed anyways. Sylvie Baker's gave Joey Proccacini a boner. Okay. You know, Abigail, I am super impressed with your emerging social conscience. I really am. Shall we leave it at that? Or is now the time to pile on Bonnie? (waves crashing) (seagull screeching) I just have a very low tolerance for injustice, which is exactly what's going on with Ziggy and his mom. You fled the table when Abby brought up Bonnie. I'd ask what's the deal with Bonnie, but... I think we both know it's really about Nathan. That is not true. Yeah, it is true. Ed, I shouldn't have to constantly run into the guy. Monterey has 30,000 people, and I can't go to a goddamn yoga class without seeing him and her? And yoga? Give me a break. When I was married to him, he wouldn't so much as go for a walk. And when he finally did, he never came back. Remember that big fight I promised? Yeah? I think now would be a good time. Why? Is Nathan the one? What? What do you... what do you mean? The one. For every person, there's the one. Case in point, you're my one. Well, you are my... Shut up. But for you, he's the one you fell irreparably in love with, who irreparably broke your heart, who you apparently can't get over 15 years later. (scoffing) Have you lost your mind? No, I'm never out of my mind. I don't get to be crazy, Madeline. I'm stable, I'm grounded. Good ol' steady Eddie, that's me. Wow. (scoffs) Where is this coming from? It's coming from the fact that you don't really seem to adore me, that you're rarely interested in having s*x, but specifically today, it's coming from your constant carrying on about Nathan and his seemingly perfect life, which tells me that you are far from satisfied with your own. And I am f*cking sick of it. Look, I may not be the good-looking adventure ride, okay? But there is something to be said for being there, for being truthful, for being somebody you can steadfastly count on. I will not be anybody's runner-up. You need to hear that. Scratch the surface of any Jimmy Stewart... (Thea whispers) Charlie Manson. (monster roaring on TV) Josh : No! (Max gasps) You okay? He's scared. Scared? What are you scared of? No, I'm not. He is. Oh, he is. (sighs) How's Ziggy doing? Good. Do you think he was the one who hurt Amabella the other day? Twins : No. He's really nice. Could he come over? Yeah, maybe. Okay. Just have to ask your dad. (cell phone buzzing) Hey, wanna meet me at Side Door? I need to swap out my family for some vodka. (laughs) Is your nanny there? Yeah. She is, actually. Great, I'll see you then. I think they both had drinking problems. I do. Tom :  Well, I'm happy to let you post it,  but nobody really reads these flyers. And if you wanna get work these days, you need a website. I know, it's just so expensive. It's not as much as you think. Madeline's husband Ed is in web design. He could help you put something together. Maybe. I already have an accountant, but otherwise, I would... It's all good. No, I would. Do you have any clients? Yeah, I have a few portables still from Santa Cruz. Okay. Can I ask what brought you here? Ziggy :  The schools are great,  to build a better life for her son. That's all you'll get. Jane : Whoa. Yeah, Ziggy, I did come here with dreams of a certain life. You are right. Hopefully a better one. Ziggy :  Mom. The chocolate one? Okay, but I'm eating some. ♪ There's a fire inside, even in you ♪

♪ You're gonna go hungry if you don't know what you need... ♪ "Is Nathan the one?" Ugh. Of course not! That he doubts my love for him? And Ed's not a neurotic guy, so maybe it is me. Maybe I'm just lousy at conveying how much I... I don't know. You once said that you two don't have s*x very often. That's because I'm exhausted all the time from school, or the kids, or the play. What was Nathan like in bed? I don't want to talk about Nathan. Really? Yeah. But we are talking about Nathan. No, we were talking about Ed. Okay. Okay, what? Is it possible that you had a little more passion for Nathan than you have for Ed? And maybe he senses that. Men can be a little more intuitive than we give them credit for, you know? Have you thought about seeing a counselor? Oh, my God, we don't need a counselor. Couples fight. You telling me you and Perry don't ever fight? No, we do. Sometimes. And then do you run off to therapy afterward? (chuckles) More often than not, we... we end up having s*x. Really? Yes. It starts with anger. I don't... it's complicated. Sometimes I think that he likes to fight because it leads to s*x. Sometimes I think I like it, too. How often does this happen? Happens... enough. I have to say, Celeste, that sounds a little bit twisted. But kind of great. Yeah. (laughing) So, the s*x that you have is like... ♪ Hello ♪ (laughs) 
 
 Hi, Celeste, Madeline! How are you? Hi, Renata. I was over there with my girlfriends, getting our drink on, and I saw you two. Do you have a second? Sure. Did you know that they're thinking about closing down the local V.A. hospital? It means that vets are having to drive all the way to Sacramento for their services, which is so upsetting. I've really dedicated a lot of my life to vets, specifically PTSD, so I'm gonna hold a little, you know, fundraising dinner party and help defray costs and keep the facility open. It would be so great if you and Perry could come. Yeah, sure. And... and, um, you and Ed, of course. It would be so nice. Madeline :  You're such a kind person, Renata. Thank you. And, you know, it was very sweet of you to invite Chloe to Amabella's birthday party. Of course! Of course. Madeline :  However, it wasn't very sweet to single out and exclude little Ziggy. Really? You think it would be okay for little Amabella to be strangled at her birthday party? I don't think so. If Ziggy doesn't go, then Chloe's not going. Okay, I don't... I don't think this is the right time to be... let's just... Thank you. And if Chloe's out, then the entire brigade will follow. She's basically the pied piper. What? (sighs) I like you, Madeline. And... and I actually admire you for sticking up for your unapologetic friend, but if I can offer something as objectively as I possibly can... (whispering) do not f*ck with my daughter's birthday. Gabrielle :  I was in that bar, and I distinctly saw Madeline...  glance at a steak knife. What a c**t. Excuse me? Why don't you get f*cked? Renata :  Wow. The war is on. Ed :  You know, this really isn't fair to Chloe. Excuse me? Last year, Amabella had a jumping castle and a magician. This year only figures to be better. Oh, please. For you to summarily say she can't go, then use her as a tool to get other kids not to go... I am not doing that. You know, one minute it's Nathan or Bonnie. Now Renata, not to mention the parking monitor, the girls in the car. I can't even keep track of all the fights you start. Somebody needs to invent an app. Well, maybe you could have my back in some of them. What is it about this Jane? What is she, a long-lost sister or something? Just a cause in lieu of... In lieu of what? In lieu of a life? Is that what you were gonna say? Jane's a single mom. Do you need an app to put two and two together? When Abigail was a little baby, Nathan was not around and I was a single mom, Ed. And I'm still angry about it. It's not my love for Nathan that lingers after 15 years, it's my resentment. There's a big difference. (spits) (grunts) Madeline :  Did you hear me? (sighs) (seat belt buckle clicks) Oh. They arrived just after you left. Double the price, I think, for nighttime deliveries. Wow. Kelly : On a less positive note, I believe I failed you miserably. (twins playing) (all giggling) I thought Harry was just a stupid stuffed animal for babies. He is. (laughing) Mom? Mm-hmm. Can we sleep with you tonight? Again? Mmm. Mmm, well... as long as Harry doesn't snore. I've heard it's a problem, a real problem with hippos. Daddy snores. Yes, Daddy does snore. (chuckles) (mocks snoring) (laughing) No, like this! (giggling) Like this. (mocks snoring) No, like this. (all mock snoring) (giggling) I wish Daddy were here. Oh... yeah, me, too. But the four of us all together, we're gonna be fine. Mmm. Hmm? Oh, what happened? Harry is missing a leg. Josh : It was Max. Max : It was Josh. It was Max! It was Josh! Jane : You know, that's really... that's super sweet of you, Madeline. And as much as I appreciate that, I feel like, you know, Sweetheart, everyone just assumes around here I'm the root cause of everything. Don't worry. Jane : Right. I think I would prefer it if you let Chloe go to the birthday party. Let me call you right back. Jane : But I... Chloe, get in the car. (music playing) Chloe, get in the car right now. What? I need to talk to you. (mouths) Now. (sighs) I'm not having s*x, I promise you. What are those pills? They're just for in case, you know, the day comes. Not that it's coming any time soon, but I just have them. You are 16 years old. Where did you get them? From a doctor. Dr. Ennis? She wrote you a prescription without calling me? Not her. I went to Planned Parenthood. Please don't make a big deal about this. I'm not sexually active, okay? Who took you there? What? Planned Parenthood. Did you take a car, an Uber? Did somebody give you a ride? It's in Seaside. How did you get there? (kids chattering) Here you are. Love you, Mama. Love you. Bye. (whistle trills) Madeline : Stay in the car. Monitor : Ma'am! Madeline : I'm just gonna be a minute. Bonnie? Bonnie, can I talk to you for just a second? Of course. A couple of things. First of all, I'm happy that Abigail has bonded with your mother. Thrilled about the communal potato peeling thing. But when it comes to my daughter's social recreational life, particularly as it concerns medications that will permanently affect her reproductive organs, will you just kick that little can of worms over to me? Do you understand? I do. And should Skye come to me 10 years down the road and ask for a little lift to Planned Parenthood, I would give you that courtesy call first. Thanks. Ma'am! Madeline :  I'm dropping off my kid! Come on, Chloe. ...don't give my daughter... That's my daughter. Next time you wanna do something... why don't I take  your  daughter? Your daughter? Do whatever you want to her. (scoffs) f*cking kidding me? Madeline :  And what I don't understand is why my own daughter wouldn't come to me first. Jane :  I couldn't talk to my mom about birth control. Madeline :  Really? If I were you, I would just let it go. I would, with Bonnie, Abigail. I'd ride it out. No, I love my grudges. I tend to them like little pets. All right. I'm just saying. I do the same thing. I'm not into forgiveness either. Really? Who do you not forgive? No one. Just in general, you know? Never forgive, never forget. That sure sounds like a motto to live by. Good morning, Maddie. Hi, Tom. How are you? Everyone's making me angry. I'm sorry to hear that. Except for you. And me. And you guys. Oh... Marv Herman. He runs the muffler shop on Kentner, and I hear that he's in need of some bookkeeping assistance. Great. Thank you. And, actually, maybe some legal assistance, too, if the zoning board stays on him. I'm retired. Unless you're defending the First Amendment. Celeste : You never give up. Oh, I heard about this. Ridiculous. I mean, I can't. It is ridiculous. It's obscene. What can I get you, Maddie? Oh, I'll have a cappuccino. And a shot. (laughing) I'm sure you have one back there. I'll see what I can do. Thank you. Yeah, I guess... I guess Shakespeare got it wrong. "The play's the thing" unless it has puppets. Exactly! See, he understands me. Unfortunately, gay. Really? Mm. Celeste : Come on. Yes! You're sure of that? All the best ones are. (seagulls screeching) Hey. Hey, Ed. What's up? Hey. Love the look, especially the mirror. It's... you got to respect a man who has his own back. Oh. Well, standard stuff. Yeah. How's the computer business going? Oh, great. Kind of like landscaping, I guess. Growth business. (chuckling) That's... that's clever. Um, hey, thanks for meeting me. Yeah, yeah. Yeah. I just want to discuss this whole thing with, like... that happened with Bonnie and Abby. Sure. You know, as far as I can tell, there was no undue influence or interference. Like, Abby asked Bonnie some questions about Planned Parenthood, Bonnie answered them. Abby then asked Bonnie to drive her there. There was no parental usurps of any kind, I promise you that. But I can discuss that whole thing with Maddie. What I wanted to take up with you is... I think you can probably appreciate that it's a bit of a delicate balancing act with my ex. So... and, you know, I kind of expect her to be rough on me, but I think it's... like, you can't punish Bonnie. Well, I believe she's being nice to Bonnie, or at least trying under the circumstances. What circumstances would those be? Nathan, come on. It was pretty tough when you left. But that was 15 years ago. Okay, it's difficult for Madeline to see you at every school function so involved when you weren't there for Abigail. It's difficult to run into you at yoga when you never... You know what? Maybe I'm talking out of turn here. No, I was young, you know? Maybe a bit of a sh1t. But I made some real mistakes with both Maddie and Abby, but should I be required to make the same mistakes with Bonnie and Skye? No, but, you know, doesn't hurt to be mindful of other people's feelings sometimes. Oh, yeah, yeah. Mr. Sensitive. Excuse me? No, actually, I meant that as a compliment. You're kind of like today's standard-bearer for the evolved man. Like, you work at home, you... Uh-huh. You do almost 50-50 in the childcare. You even cook. Right, so you're the guy who likes to fish and hunt, and I'm Mr. Girly-Man? That's not what I meant at all, man. Okay. I thought it'd be indelicate to bring it up with Maddie. That's why I'm bringing it up with you. Well, that sounded like a threat, Nathan. Are you threatening me? No, but, actually, I feel like you're starting to threaten me, which I don't think you want to go there. You know, this thing with that Ziggy kid, all the talk of bullying? I was bullied. Sixth grade. And I always turned the other cheek, thinking that was the more mature thing to do. Some 30 years later, it still haunts me that I didn't beat the sh1t out of that kid. So much so, I find myself fantasizing that somebody will come along one day and say or do something to me that'll offer me the chance to redeem myself. You've always treated me quite well, Nathan. It's too bad. Too bad. (scoffs) What? The first thing I said, the very first thing I said... "It wasn't just the mothers." I'm gonna kick your f*cking ass if you f*cking talk to me like that again, you f*cking little sh1t. Ed and Nathan hated each other's guts. Aren't we all afraid to say that? There's clearly a lot of bad blood in this community. Madeline :  What did he say? Joseph :  The mayor refuses to authorize funding for the production. Madeline :  Which should be a legal matter, and we could make it a legal matter. The funding is discretionary. He could deny it on whatever grounds... Is he denying it? He's suggesting we pick something more community-centric. Joseph, we have worked so hard for this, and we are being victimized by the small-mindedness led by the likes of Renata Klein. Understood, but we need to pick our battles, and this is just... And sometimes our battles pick us. We can't quit. We just can't. Is this about the play or winning? (scoffs) I don't know. Maybe it's a little bit about both. But I get sick and tired of the morally superior in this town stepping all over everybody else. And you said you wanted to be brave with your artistic direction. That's all I'm asking... just... just be brave. You told me to go f*ck myself on the head. (laughs) I just get... You know how I get. Please. This is important to me. I'll talk to the mayor. (sighs) Thank you. You're not gonna regret it. You're not. What's this? "Frozen." Taking my wife and my little niece. Amabella passed out her invitations on Wednesday morning. (doorbell rings) Gabrielle :  Madeline was on the phone  inviting the kids to Disney on Ice by Thursday noon. Harper :  The two events were scheduled for the same day, same time. A vicious shot over the bow. (groans) Yeah. It's ridiculous. Okay. Thank you. Yeah, of course. I don't know what's wrong with this woman. It's like she's power hungry. She can't just let us all get along... I said thank you-uuu! (screaming) (music playing over earbuds) (volume increases) (distant scream echoes) ♪ Why don't you dance with me? ♪ 
♪ I'm not no Limburger ♪ 
♪ Why don't you dance with me? ♪ 
♪ I'm not no Limburger ♪ 
♪ Oh, say ♪ ♪ Why don't you dance with me? ♪ (cell phone buzzing) ♪ I'm not no Limb... ♪ Hello? (panting) (Jane's voice echoing) Sexual assault? (Nippal's voice echoing) It appears Ziggy kissed Amabella, and the advance was unwelcome (muffled, echoing) Ziggy kissed Amabella. (rings) (muffled, echoing) Ziggy kissed... Amabella. (receiver clacks) (gunshot) In addition to the murder investigation, we are investigating others on assault and conspiracy to incite violence. The intent, by all accounts, was to simply make peace with Amabella. Which is an admission that he did try to choke her. No, just hold... hold on. Zigfield still maintains his innocence on the whole choking front. The idea of brandishing affection upon Amabella was first proffered by Chloe in an attempt to ameliorate the whole birthday party brouhaha. I'm sorry. Excuse me. Are you saying Chloe had something to do with this? Renata : Uh, yes. Yes. Mrs. Klein. She played a song, she invited Zigfield and Amabella to dance, and it seems your daughter has inherited the "let's solve everyone else's problems" gene. (scoffs) The motion was then seconded by Skye. I don't believe that my daughter would ever sanction a non-consensual touching. She's a very peaceful child. Isn't this just a whole lot of brouhaha about nothing? Okay, look, we have a policy, sir... It's not nothing. ...and we'll get to the bottom of it. Renata : You have a policy? Yes. Well, isn't that great news? Why don't you follow your policy or I'm getting an attorney. Okay, we're not there yet, Mrs. Klein. I'm there. God, attorneys? Really? Is that necessary? Thank you. Actually, in my graduate thesis I coined the term "helicopter parent." But these gems, they're...  they're f*cking kamikazes. And I'm not kidding. No one takes responsibility for anything. And Chloe's involved. Madeline : Not to mention their health and well-being. I mean, if I had a dime for every boy that I tried to kiss when I was six years old... I mean, I can't even tell you. There were so many. They're children, for Christ's sakes. They're supposed to be doing things like kissing each other. Jane? What's wrong, honey? (crying) You okay? I'm sorry, I just... Honey. It's okay. They're just kids. (continues indistinctly) (music playing) How can you not wanna make up on this song? Come on. Make up, yes, not make out, silly. It's what you guys do when you get mad at each other. Big hug, kiss, bang, and everything's better again. But it's different with married people. Why? I don't know. It just is.

♪ Every part of me... ♪ (Skype tone chiming) Hi, baby. Hey, Sparkles. I thought it was, like, midnight there. Yeah, I can't sleep. Jet lag. Right. Is that the bathrobe I bought you? Mm-hmm. It is. (twins playing) Thank you for the flowers. They're beautiful. I miss you. Yeah. I miss you, too. (twins chattering) And the boys miss you. So, how was their second day? It was fine. Hey, will you do me a favor? What? Take that beautiful robe off for a second. (chuckles) The boys are waiting for me downstairs. Yeah, well, I have to help myself go to sleep. You need to help me help myself. Do I, now? Let me just look at my gorgeous wife for a second. Ten seconds. I'll give you five. Wow, make it a nice five. (clears throat) Okay, that's enough, naughty boy. You'll have to come home sooner if you want more. Come closer. I love you. Take her out of school if you're that concerned. She's the one that has to leave? She didn't do anything. I just don't think legal action is the answer, all right? Let's see how it goes. I'm guessing it'll all sort itself out. I do not feel supported here. (scoffs) Well... I don't suppose I could argue with your feelings. (chuckles) Ziggy, why are you awake? You're supposed to be asleep. What's going on? I saw you crying at school today. I was just stressed out. I'm sorry you had to see that. At pick-up I heard one of the mothers say I was a little monster. What? Baby, you're not a monster. You are not a monster. Ziggy there's nothing wrong with you. Okay? (whispers) I love you so much. (kissing) Pickles and mustard. I'm not pregnant. You know, if that day ever comes, the one you alluded to earlier... Hmm. The day I decide to have s*x? That day? Yes, that one. Can we talk about it first? Sure. 'Cause I actually think I could be helpful. Okay. I have a lot of girlfriends, as you know, and never has any one of them ever said to me, "Gee, if only I had had s*x sooner in life." Mm-hmm. This is awkward now. Right. (music playing) So, Nathan said that you threatened to beat him up. Oh. Of course not. He wanted me to get you to back off Bonnie a little bit, it led to a discussion, and... I never threatened to beat him up. I did let him know I wouldn't be intimidated by him, which I think was his intent. So, how did you two leave it? We left it... he's got Bonnie's back and I've got yours. ♪ Been traveling these wide roads... ♪ My He-Man. Oh, come on. (laughing) Can I just say one thing? You never leave it at one thing.
