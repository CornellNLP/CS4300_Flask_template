 - Madeline:  The shooting range? 
- Jane.    
 What were you doing there?    
 Target practice. I try to go once a month.    
 You were doing target practice?    
 Mm-hmm. You seem suspicious.    
 Well, we're going on a road trip to go meet the person that assaulted you,    
 and you're doing target practice?    
 I'm not suspicious at all.    
 I'm not planning on shooting the man.    
 - (chuckles) Oh, my God. 
- I just...    
 I have a thing about guns to begin with.    
 Nathan and I used to fight about it constantly.    
 He's obsessed with guns.    
 All those mass shootings. I don't know.    
 It's actually helped me a lot, owning one.    
 Really?    
 They say just holding one in your hand    
 has psychological benefits for emotional trauma.    
 - Oh, I didn't know that. 
- Mm-hmm.    
 Yeah, because it inhibits mentalization,    
 so it helps you block yourself off from emotions.    
 - And that's a good thing? 
- Yeah.    
 If the memories are painful enough, absolutely.    
 You know, I feel stronger with one,    
 more empowered.    
 - Hey, ladies. 
- Oh, hi.    
 Maybe I should get a gun.    
 There's more than one person    
 - I'd like to shoot in this town. 
- (laughs)    
 No, sweet pea, that's dirty.    
 Come on, you can't go to a playdate in dirty clothes.    
 In this town, they'll report me to child services.    
 You can leave in a mess, but don't...    
 - Amabella. 
- What?

 Amabella:  We were all just playing.   
 - Share with us. 
- Was it that Ziggy?    
 - I don't know! 
- All right!    
 Well, just tell us! All right? It's not all right!    
 - She's being bullied! 
- Renata!    
 - Oh, my God! It's a bite! 
- Just keep your voice down.    
 Someone is biting our daughter!    
 (huffs) Oh, my God, okay.    
 Honey, Mommy is getting very upset.    
 I'm getting very, very upset    
 because someone is bullying you.    
 And you never let a bully win.    
 Do you hear me?    
 You have to speak up, Amabella.    
 You have to be a big girl and use your voice in this world.    
 That's why they call me a bulldog,    
 because I had to learn how to fight back with a bully.    
 I... we gotta clean this.    
 Okay, all right. Just...    
 Hey, you.     
 Who's ever hurting you,     
 they might be harming somebody else.     
 And you wouldn't want that, huh?     
 You wouldn't want innocent people getting hurt.     
 You're too kind for that.     
 Huh?     
 Right?     
 What happened to your tennis game?     
 Oh, I changed my mind.     
 Where are the boys?     
 They're at Judo.     
 You knew that.     
 What?     
 You decided to skip your tennis game and, uh...     
 And, uh...     
 (pants, moans)     
 - (fabric rips) 
- (grunts)     
 (both moaning)     
 - Oh, baby. 
-  (object clatters)   
 People out there that say they have satisfying s*x lives...     
 (moans)     
 Give me a f*cking break.     
 - (both groan, gasp) 
- Oh, God.     
 (phone buzzing)   
 (line ringing)   
 (phone dings)     
 "Why?     
 Are you having wild, torrid s*x?"     
 (phone chirps)     
 (phone dings)   
 Yeah, right.     
 Do not use the downstairs bathroom, honey.   
 (keyboard clicking)   
 Jesus.     
 (sighs)     
 May... maybe we should just take her out.     
 - Put her in a private school. 
- What?     
 So she should have to go instead of that little felon?     
 Oh, Renata, God, please.     
 Oh! Do not tell me to calm down.     
 - I will take my hands... 
- Can you take a breath...     
 - and put them around your throat! 
- for one second?     
 (exhales)     
 Is that better?     
 You know, you should be more upset.     
 I'm very upset.     
 Oh, really? 'Cause I don't see it, Gordon.     
 Do not make this a referendum on my anger.     
 That someone has been hurting her for who knows how long,     
 that we haven't even known about it,     
 that we can't even stop it,     
 and that she won't even talk to us about it...     
 - I know! 
- Don't pull out your f*cking scorecard     
 to total up who's got the most anger.     
 Oh, you're the one that's getting mad at me?     
 Instead of some little fucker who's chomping on our kid?     
 Will you just listen to me for one goddamn minute?     
 I will not listen. That's what I did last time.     
 Because I said to you something's wrong with Amabella,     
 but you didn't want to hear it, huh?     
 I said let's take her to a child psychiatrist.     
 - But you had a better idea, didn't you? 
- What?     
 Taking me into your office bathroom     
 and f*cking the sh1t out of me on the f*cking sink!     
 God damn it, will you stop yelling at me?     
 God damn it!     
 Would you f*cking...     
 You sure you don't wanna go on the couch or in the bed?     
 You complain we never have s*x. Just shut up and f*ck me.     
 Okay.     
 When I first meet a couple, I visualize them fornicating.     
 I mean, I know that sounds crazy,     
 but with Madeline and Ed...     
 I just couldn't see it.     
 Okay, this is gonna take too long.     
 - Okay. 
- Here, just like that.     
 - Here. 
-  (door closes)   
 Chloe:  It's me.   
 Hi, honey!     
 Is your playdate over already?     
 I'm hungry.     
 Ed:  They didn't have food at your friend's place?   
 Today's grocery day, so before Abigail eats everything,   
 I wanted to...   
 Sorry, Mom.     
 It's okay.     
 See, I bought more of your crap and less of her crap.     
 You know what? I'll make you one of my special BLTs.     
 Give me   ?     
 Deal, my man!     
 Now you can go back to whatever you were doing     
 or pretending not to.     
 (both sigh)     
 Laundry room?     
 Only takes me five to make a BLT.     
 (computer chimes)     
 - Ed:  Honey, come on. 
- Hold on.     
 Nathan: No, no, I don't know about that. What is that?     
 Madeline:  One of her friends makes mention of it on her Facebook page.   
 She said, "Is this the shot you're going to use   
 on your secret project?" question mark.     
 "Is it sexy/slutty enough?" question mark.     
 I mean, what kind of project is this, Nathan?     
 Well, if it's a secret project,     
 then that's probably why I don't know about it.     
 I mean, why are you on Abby's Facebook page?     
 How did she friend you?     
 I'm not her friend, I'm her mother.   
 And it's my job to be on it and it's yours, too,   
 particularly when she's living with you.   
 You assume the obligation to parent,   
 which is what I guess you've been pretty...   
 She's gonna kill you.     
 He hung up on me.     
 Ugh, what a f*ck.     
 Chloe:  Watch your mouth, woman.   
 Why are you never playing your loud music when it's a good time?     
 Are you sure you should be snooping around on her Facebook page?     
 I am her mother.     
 It is my f*cking duty to spy on her.     
 Last few days, I don't know where your head has been.     
 What are you... what are you not telling me?     
 I mean,     
 I might have put something stupid into motion.     
 Okay.     
 Well, you know I told you about Jane's past.     
 - She was sexually assaulted. 
- Right.     
 Well, I think I found her assaulter.     
 He's an interior decorator in San Luis Obispo.     
 And?     
 Well, Jane is determined to confront him,     
 so Celeste made an appointment with him next Wednesday, ostensibly to hire him,     
 which probably was a little bit more my idea.     
 And we're all just gonna go down there and see.     
 No, you're not.     
 You are going to call the police.     
 But we don't even know if it's him, Ed.     
 Well, suppose it is.     
 The man is dangerous, right?     
 Well, I mean, there's gonna be three of us     
 and we're in a crowded office space.     
 What, you're telling me Perry Wright     
 is letting Celeste go on this mission?     
 Well, Perry doesn't exactly know.     
 - Jane swore us to secrecy. 
- All right.     
 But I was not gonna let her go down there     
 and do that by herself.   
 Madeline, this is a bad idea.     
 Ed, she needs closure,     
 and I don't think I can stop her at this point.     
 And I'm certainly not gonna let her go alone.     
 -  (music playing over earbuds) 
- (phone buzzing)     
 Hello?     
 Hi, Emily Barnes here from Otter Bay school.   
 Yeah, what's going on?     
 Um, listen.   
 We have a problem.   
 (waves crashing)   
 f*ck!     
 (seagulls screeching)   
 (music resumes)   
 f*ck! (bangs table)     
 Sorry.     
 Sorry. (chuckles)     
 So, does Ms. Barnes now think that Ziggy bit Amabella?     
 I don't think so.     
 But because the Kleins came forward,     
 she feels like she had to tell the principal.     
 And so now I have to go meet with him tomorrow.     
 It's ridiculous.     
 You might have to be a lawyer again.     
 Did you ask Ziggy if he bit her?     
 Jane:  Yeah, of course, but he said no.   
 Ugh, it's just never over in this f*cking town     
 that I wish to f*cking God I never came to.     
 - Don't say that. 
- I don't think this is a good week     
 to be going to San Luis Obispo.     
 No, I'm fine. I just...     
 I'm fine.     
 Ed is insisting on going with us.     
 I didn't want to tell him,     
 but he knew I was keeping something from him.     
 He says it's not safe, and I think he might be right, you guys.     
 It might be better to have him there with us.     
 Madeline?     
 Sorry to interrupt.     
 Can I talk to you, please?     
 Yeah. Of course.     
 I'll be right back.     
 Yeah.     
 (laughter, chatter)     
 - What? 
- We need to talk.     
 When I came to the theater, you did not want to talk to me.     
 - Let's take a drive. 
- I don't think that's a good idea.     
 Do you want me to say what I've got to say here?     
 'Cause I can't promise decorum.     
 - Okay. 
- Okay.     
 -  (engine turns off) 
- I don't want to talk about the other day.     
 Then what is this about?     
 Oh, I'm sorry to be such an annoyance.   
 Well, it is annoying, Joseph.     
 Just say what you want to say, please.     
 This is about me understanding... like, what is this?   
 Where do I stand?   
 Can you look at me, please?   
 I get it, you're an upstanding member of the Monterey community.     
 This is not compatible.     
 But, you know, f*ck convention.     
 Like, let's do this. Let's throw it all away.     
 I know you have feelings for me.     
 Well, then if you know that, just cling to that.     
 I have to go back.     
 Can you please take me back?     
 That you're this uncomfortable with the conversation...   
 Of course I'm uncomfortable!     
 I cheated on my husband.     
 I cheated on my wife!     
 Why come back?     
 Why get so involved with the theater?   
 Because I thought you and I were over with.     
 We were buried. It was over, it was done.     
 I don't believe you.   
 You come into my office all the time.     
 You're sitting on my desk. Like, what are you doing?     
 Are you playing me?     
 You know it's not over.   
 You can't look at me 'cause you know it's true.   
 Can you take me back, please?     
 - For... God's sakes. 
-  (engine starts)   
 Like, how do you...     
 how do you brush it all off?     
 Like it's like nothing's happening.   
 I get you don't want to have feelings.     
 Right? You've got a family.   
 But you kissed me back at the theater and...   
 -  (Madeline gasps) 
- (tires squealing)     
 (horn blaring)   
 (high-pitched ringing)   
 (no audible dialogue)     
 (door opens)   
 It's possible you're concussed,     
 but I don't think so.     
 You have any headache? You feel sleepy or groggy?     
 - No. 
- Are you sure?     
 - Mm-hmm. 
- We can do a CAT scan if you want...     
 I'm not going to expose myself to unnecessary radiation     
 just to keep your premiums down.     
 - I'm sorry. 
- Ed:  Honey...   
 I'm fine.     
 I didn't even hit my head.     
 What about Joseph? Is Joseph all right?     
 He's stable. His family is with him now.     
 - Okay. 
-  Okay.   
 Woman on P.A.:  Dr. Howard, radiology.   
 Woman:  He is concussed and had a pneumothorax.   
 He remarkably had no broken bones.   
 - Pneumothorax? 
- That's a collapsed lung.     
 He's in recovery right now.     
 We'll bring him down to the ICU in a couple of hours     
 and you can visit him there.     
 Your husband will be fine.     
 Thank you.     
 What happened?     
 I don't know.     
 This kid out of nowhere ran a stop sign.     
 I didn't see him coming.     
 I don't think Joseph did either.     
 Abigail:  Mom?   
 - Hey. 
- Are you okay?     
 Hi. I'm fine, honey. 
How did you get here?     
 A lot of people were talking about exactly why Joseph Bachman     
 and Madeline Mackenzie were in that car together.     
 I'm sure it had something to do with artistic expression.     
 Sorry I couldn't make it to the hospital.     
 She's a little shaken up, but she's gonna be fine.     
 Joseph's gonna be fine, too.     
 Geez. What about the guy in the truck?     
 It wasn't a guy. It was a teenage boy.   
 They think he was texting.   
 I've got to sit down to dinner     
 with Perry and the kids right now, so...     
 why don't you give her a call?     
 She's at home. She'd love to hear from you.     
 I will.     
 - Have a good night. 
- Bye.     
 Was she wearing her seat belt?     
 Oh, yeah, I'm sure she was.     
 It would be very dangerous if she wasn't.     
 Who's he?     
 He's just an interior decorator,     
 so he picks out furniture and stuff for homes.     
 I was thinking we could get some new furniture.     
 What's wrong with our furniture?     
 Nothing, but it would be fun, right?     
 Change it up a little.     
 What should we make for dinner?     
 - (imitating siren) 
- Come on, eat up.     
 You haven't even eaten anything.     
 Perry. Perry.     
 Hey!     
 Toys down, food up.     
 Hop to.     
 Max:  Teenagers are bad.   
 Do we have to be teenagers?   
 Yeah, yeah, I'm afraid you do. (chuckles)     
 I'm gonna skip that part.     
 - What? 
- Teenagers aren't that bad.     
 In fact, once you're a teenager,     
 you will only wanna hang out with other teenagers.     
 You'll think all grownups are bad.     
 Josh:  Teenagers think you're bad?   
 Oh, yeah.     
 Max:  They do?   
 Absolutely.     
 Especially when I use my...     
 - (belches) 
- Ugh!     
 ...burping superpower, they do.     
 Perry, come on.     
 (sighs)     
 Or when I speak with my...     
 (low-pitched) special voice.     
 Because then they know...     
 that here comes...     
 - the monster! 
- Oh! Okay.     
 Ooh, I'm starving!     
 Give me a tender little teenager to...     
 - Come on, you haven't eaten anything. 
- ...devour!     
 (laughing)     
 (growling)     
 Ow! No, no, no. No, no!     
 Come on, get her!   
 - Stop! Stop! 
- Come here, Mom!     
 Come, I'll save you. I'll save you, honey.     
 - No, stop! No! 
- I'll save you.     
 Fire at will, boys! Fire!     
 Ed:  How are we doing? Any headaches?   
 No. You're sweet to worry, honey,     
 but you don't need to check on me every five minutes.     
 I'm fine.     
 Why were you in his car, anyway?     
 Well, I was with Jane and Celeste at Blue Blues.     
 And he came in and he was so agitated     
 about ticket sales, and...     
 the prop deliveries were late.     
 Also, one of our lead actors just came down with strep throat     
 and we're only a week away from opening night, so...     
 we were just gonna drive together to the theater and...     
 just knock some stuff out, and then...

 I never would've called you in unless we had anything more definitive.     
 Is there anything out of the ordinary in Ziggy's past?     
 His home life, his background,     
 anything you think we should know that might be relevant?     
 I understand Ziggy's father's not involved in his upbringing. Is that right?     
 The only thing I know about Ziggy's father     
 is that he's keen on erotic asphyxiation and raping women.     
 You did not say that.     
 No, of course I didn't, but I wanted to.     
 Can you imagine if the people in this town found out     
 that Ziggy wasn't a product of consensual, loving s*x,     
 but a product of rape?     
 It'd be the worst.     
 Every time someone asks me about Ziggy's dad,     
 I'm terrified they're going to expose me.     
 I thought f*cking Renata Klein was gonna spot me right then.     
 - What do you mean? 
- (knock on door)     
 - Mr. and Mrs. Klein are here. 
- Madeline:  No.   
 They are early, so if you could tell them to come back...     
 Renata:  You know, we were just seeing if you could fit us in.   
 Uh, wait, is it possible that you could come back later?     
 Well, we're all here to discuss the same topic, I assume.     
 You've heard about the, uh... bite?     
 Have you been telling her she needs to get her son under control?     
 Okay, Renata, Renata. Please, just excuse my wife, all right?     
 She's very upset.     
 Hi. Gordon Klein.     
 - Jane Chapman. 
- Hi.     
 All right, well... well, then maybe perhaps     
 we could have a constructive chat.     
 - There you go. 
- Please.     
 Okay, well, then how about we get some...     
 some tea or maybe some water?     
 How about... Jean, get us some...     
 - Sure. 
- ...some coffee, please?     
 I don't... I don't want refreshments.     
 (voice breaking) I want you to make your son     
 stop abusing my girl.     
 She's a fake bitch.     
 - You're too nice. 
- (Jane laughs)   
 So, what was the upshot?     
 They're gonna hire a teacher's aide     
 whose specific job will be watching Ziggy and Amabella.     
 - Are you kidding me? 
- Mm-mm.     
 That's ridiculous.     
 Maybe not. I mean, what if she's right?     
 I'm sorry, but Renata Klein cannot be right.     
 Ziggy could be marked with his dad's genetic stain.     
 And if I did everything properly as a mother,     
 it wouldn't matter and he wouldn't be behaving this way.     
 I just feel like you have such great instincts as a mom.     
 Did you ever feel like something was off?     
 When he was born, he didn't just come out crying     
 like most kids do.     
 His whole body was shaking.     
 It was like he was so upset to be born.     
 And all I could do was look at him and say...     
 "I'm so sorry, little baby.   
 I'm so, so sorry."     
 I always thought that seeing his little red face     
 would wipe away the dirty memory, you know?     
 - But... 
- Tom:  Hey, girls.   
 - Hey, Tom. 
- Can I get you anything else?     
 I would love some more tea.     
 - Sure. 
- Thank you.     
 - Jane? 
- No, thank you.     
 Harper:  Saxon Baker?   
 - Never heard of him. 
- We have a Mr. Barker at school,     
 but his first name is not Saxon, it's Ted.     
 (phone buzzing)   
 Male voice:  Hello. Please leave a message after the tone.   
 
 
 
 (beeps)   
 Celeste, we can't let Jane go on that trip.     
 I don't know, we have to steal her car or something.     
 At first, I thought she wanted closure.   
 Now I think she wants revenge.   
 - Call me. 
- (elevator dings)   
 I'm so sorry. I feel like you were driving less aware...     
 I'm here 'cause some kid ran a stop sign.     
 I think I owe you some clarity.     
 Like you said, I kissed you back the other day.     
 And maybe I wanted to feel all those things again,     
 this thing that we had.     
 Was it just s*x between us?     
 Of course it wasn't.     
 But the other day, I started to feel afraid.     
 I've had this paralyzing fear...     
 that what happened between us is gonna get out     
 and it's gonna ruin my family.     
 It's probably best if... if you beg out of the play.     
 I mean, most of the work is done now anyway, so...     
 - Yeah, of course. 
- We should be fine.     
 Yeah, you should.     
 - Tori:  Madeline. 
- Oh, hi.     
 - Hi, Tori. 
- Hi.     
 - How are you? 
- Better.     
 I think we're all doing better. How are you feeling?     
 Actually, I normally have a lot of lower back pain,     
 so probably saved me a trip to the chiropractor. (chuckles)     
 But I... I just stopped by to see if Joseph was okay.     
 I'm glad to see you're feeling better.     
 Thanks.     
 I'm just gonna head out now.     
 - Okay. 
- But good to see you, Tori.     
 - Yeah, you, too. 
- Yeah.     
 Bye.     
 Nice of her to drop by.     
 (music playing)   
 (music playing over earbuds)   
 (panting)     
 (door slams)   
 He's in Chicago.     
 He left this morning,     
 so I just... I decided to come in by myself.     
 Okay.     
 It was Perry's idea to come in in the first place, so...     
 I mean, I think that's a very healthy sign.     
 Don't you think that's positive, that he would want to come in?     
 Why did he want to come in?     
 Well, because, we're...     
 just for the same, um...     
 He's trouble... uh, we're both troubled,     
 that... that the lovemaking is tied up in, um...     
 in anger.     
 Why did you want to come in today?     
 I don't know.     
 Something happened?     
 Um...     
 Oh, just the usual, you know.     
 Um, when he left this morning, we made love.     
 It's as if our, um...     
 It's as if we turn each other on by rage.     
 Hmm.     
 And that's a problem, I think.     
 Do you think that's a problem?     
 Well, I'm encouraged that you at least think of it as lovemaking.     
 Because s*x isn't always that.     
 Does the s*x you have with Perry ever strike you as violent?     
 No.     
 Are you ever left with bruises?     
 Um, maybe.     
 I mean, I... I don't really remember.     
 (sighs)     
 Have you ever sustained bruises from something other than s*x?     
 I don't follow.     
 Your husband said he grabbed you too hard sometimes.     
 Has he ever left a mark on you by grabbing you?     
 Oh, um, I mean...     
 we have a very volatile relationship, and I...     
 I've left the occasional mark on him.     
 - I... 
- By hitting?     
 Yeah.     
 Really?     
 Hitting him first or hitting him back?     
 I have to say I'm beginning to feel a bit uncomfortable     
 because this is, um...     
 I think this is 
unethical, truth be told.     
 How... how so?     
 Because you're treating us.     
 And only you showed up,     
 so I'm treating half the couple.     
 From what I know about your duty of care,     
 you are ethically responsible...     
 I throw off the ethical chains     
 when I sense a patient in danger.     
 What?     
 (sighs)     
 He hurts you.     
 Oh, no.     
 I... no, I didn't... I mean, I didn't... I didn't say that.     
 He's... I mean...     
 I pick up on things, not just from you,     
 but from Perry.     
 We both become violent sometimes.     
 I take my share of the blame.     
 I'm...     
 He hurts you.     
 Look...     
 I'm not a victim here.     
 I'm not.     
 I hit him.     
 I throw things at him.     
 I'm...     
 What are you looking for from me, Celeste?     
 Help. Help, that's what I want.     
 I mean, we both acknowledge that this relationship is toxic.     
 We... that's why we made the appointment to come in,     
 because we... we know that.     
 We know it and we want to, um...     
 we... we want to learn techniques, strategies,     
 that's what we want, to make him...     
 - Him stop. 
- To...     
 To make us... us stop.     
 So...     
 Are you physically afraid of him?     
 (sighs)     
 This feels very wrong, I have to say.     
 I can't... I mean...     
 Um, you're meant to be our doctor.     
 You're treating us.     
 And you are demonizing him.     
 Does he know you're here alone?

 Hey. I was just thinking about you.     
 Jane:  How you feeling? 
Still no headache?   
 Oh, no, I'm fine.     
 You're sweet to worry.     
 I do worry.   
 I was just sitting here thinking about   
 how much you've done for me since I moved to Monterey.   
 I read a quote once that said...   
 "Friendships are the masterpieces of nature."     
 (chuckles)     
 I know it's cheesy, but...     
 you're totally my masterpiece.     
 And you're one of the greatest people I've ever met, Madeline.   
 If you only knew how much that meant to me right now.     
 Can I ask you a big favor?   
 Um, would you mind picking Ziggy up at pick-up?     
 I... I just have so much work to do     
 and I could use a few extra hours to catch up.     
 Yeah, no problem.     
 Oh, thank you so much.   
 I'll call the school and let them know.   
 Ziggy's all mine, honey.     
 Thanks, Madeline.   
 -  Bye. 
- Bye.

 Dr. Reisman:  Does he ever hurt the children?   
 No!     
 God, no.     
 He would never hurt the children.     
 This is... he's a wonderful father.     
 I mean, he's the best. The best.     
 I couldn't think of a better one, really.     
 It's one of the reasons that I...     
 The reason you don't leave him?     
 - There are other reasons. 
- Okay. Such as?     
 I'm madly in love with him.     
 He adores me.     
 He... he treats me like a goddess.     
 When he's not hurting you.     
 Look, he's a great father.     
 We have great s*x.     
 We make each other laugh.     
 We're... there's violence, yes, in the relationship,     
 and that's why we came in.     
 And it's an issue, but, I mean...     
 all marriages are complicated.     
 You think violence is normal in a relationship?     
 No!     
 (sighs)     
 My apologies. I misread.     
 When this violence occurs,     
 have you ever been afraid you might die?     
 Never.     
 Never?     
 That must have been terrifying.     
 Did you think of leaving him then?     
 I've thought of leaving him many times.     
 (sniffles)     
 But then I think about what we have,     
 and we have a lot.     
 Are there any weapons in your house?     
 No. No, it's not like that.     
 No. (sniffles)     
 I mean, the boys have some lightsabers.     
 (both chuckling)     
 Listen, you see a lot of couples     
 - that have bad problems. 
- Mm-hmm.     
 And after a while, maybe that's all you can see.     
 Do you ever pause to consider what is great in a marriage,     
 what is profoundly right?     
 I do.     
 Tell me, what is most...     
 profoundly right about yours?     
 We've been through so much together.     
 I had a really tough time getting pregnant.     
 And... and...     
 - I had four miscarriages. 
- Mm-hmm.     
 And when the twins were born, they were...     
 they were born really early.     
 And they were in the hospital for a long time, and that was...     
 (crying)     
 It was tough.     
 And he was there by my side every step of the way.     
 - He never... he was so good. 
- I see.     
 No, honestly, I don't think you do see, because this is...     
 this is...     
 It's special, you know?     
 We're bound by everything we've been through.     
 And the idea of breaking away from him,     
 it's like tearing flesh.     
 How do you think the abuse impacts on your sons?     
 It doesn't impact on my sons.     
 I'm telling you, I...     
 None of this affects them.     
 We never fight in front of them.     
 They never see anything. They're fine.     
 They live in a happy household.     
 They have no idea.     
 (exhales)     
 - He will hit you again. 
- Yeah.     
 - Yeah. 
- Yeah. And I'll hit him again.     
 And eventually, the boys will know.     
 - No. 
- If they already don't.     
 Oh...     
 All right, our time is about up.     
 We should make an appointment and come up with a plan.     
 A plan?     
 For the next time he hits you.
