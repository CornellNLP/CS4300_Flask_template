 Man :  So where you folks flying in from? 
 Phoenix. 
 You preaching on Sunday? 
 I mean, you are Grace Greenleaf, ain't you? 
 I am. 
 I don't preach anymore. 
 Man :  You don't? Oh. How come? 
 Can we get out here, please? 
 Well, the house is just up the road here... 
 I know, but could we... 
 Why are we stopping... 
 Right here is great. 
 Man : Okay. 
 Hope I didn't say the wrong thing. 
 Not at all. 
 I just wanted a chance to stretch my legs, you know? 
 How far is it to the house? 
 Not far. Just wait a second. 
 My mama used to love your preaching. 
 I hope I can say that. 
 You've seen her preach? 
 Oh, yeah. 
 My mama used to go to Calvary every Sunday when she was alive. 
 She used to drag me there when your mama was preaching. 
 She'd say, "How come you can't find a righteous girl like that, Eugene? 
 Why you always running around with these trashy hos?" 
 I'm sorry. That's how my mother was. 
 Oh, no, no, no. It's all right. 
 She's heard it all. 
 Here you go. 
 Tip's already included in the fare, ma'am. 
 That's the genius of the app. 
 Did your mama give money to Calvary when she was alive? 
 Well, I suppose she did, yeah. 
 This isn't a tip. This is a refund. 
 Partial refund, anyway. 
 All right. God bless you. 
 You, too. Thanks. 
 Baby, come on. 
 (engine starts) 
 Are you okay? 
 Yeah. 
 I just wanted to stop. 
 (birds chirping) 
 Is that the lake where Aunt Faith... 
 Better get going. 
 Wow. 
 Yeah. 
 Didn't look like this when I lived here. 
 They've made some improvements. 
 Can I help you folks? 
 Hi. I'm Grace Greenleaf. 
 I'm sorry, Miss Greenleaf. 
 I heard you guys would be in a town car. 
 Yeah, I just... wanted to walk. 
 Hey, Noah. 
 I'm so sorry. 
 Yeah, me, too. 
 Thank you. 
 Sophia, this is Mr. Kendall. 
 Head of security. 
 Nice to meet you. 
 I'll drive you out to the house. 
 I'll take those for you. 
 That'd be great. Thank you. 
 So how far is it to the house? 
 It's about a mile or so. 
 Wow. 
 ♪ Amen ♪ 
♪ Amen ♪ 
 (vocalizing) 
 ♪ Well ♪ 
 (vocalizing) 
 ♪ Amen, amen, ooh. ♪ Noah : So, are you still reporting for the news? Yeah. We might be moving to New York. Sophia. For what? She's going to be on "20/20." Seriously? No. That's big time. I just interviewed twice. They haven't even offered me the job yet. That's cool to be considered, anyway. And you'll probably get it. We'll see. Sophia :  Does the whole family live in this house? Grace :  Yeah. Sophia : Wow. The prodigal daughter returns. Daddy. No, no. Stay right here, child. I want to hold on to you. I... I need to. You know what Isaiah said. Isaiah said a lot of things, Daddy. "Remember not the former things, nor consider the things of old." This here's a time for healing. Hmm? I know. You going to greet your Uncle Mac? Hi. Oh, let me take a look at my beautiful granddaughter. I've waited so long to meet you. Promise me... you're not here to sow discord in the fields of my peace. Nice to see you, too, Mama. I mean, I just don't want trouble. I don't think I could take it. I'm only here for two days. I just want to pay my respects. Good. Come on. Sophia! So tell me, how was your flight? Lord, we stand humbly before you on this day facing a great mystery. As your servant Job said long before us,  "Where shall wisdom be found? Where is the place of understanding?" We mortals do not know it. It is not found in the land of the living. You've taken our daughter... our sister... our friend. Please hold her close, Lord, and let her know that she is loved. Let us pray. The Lord is my shepherd. Both : I shall not want. Hey, babe. What you getting all made up for? It's just family. It's not just family. Gigi's home. So, why didn't it work out with you and Noah? - He seems nice. (cell phone chiming) That obvious, huh? Kind of, yeah. Ugh, I have to work on my poker face. All right, get washed up for dinner, honey. You didn't answer my question. I know. Hey. Who is it? It's your Great-Aunt Mavis, baby. Y'all get in okay? Yeah, just unpacking. How was the funeral? It was fine. No one said "suicide." No one said it was all our fault. It was just God's mysterious ways. You know how Daddy is. Huh. Well , you know, you cannot expect people to feel bad about what they didn't have the heart to think happened in the first place. Think you can escape later? If dinner doesn't go late. Won't be too late for me. I don't even stop serving till 2:00 in the morning. Then I guess I'll see you. Good, and when you drive in, baby,  take 240, 'cause Barton's all closed down. Why? Demonstration. Some cop shot another child. Anyway... steal one of your daddy's cars and come see me. I will. (laughs) Yes. Hey. Thanks, Annika. Jacob. Zora's ready. Let's go. All right, one second. I'll be right there. Don't you look nice? Come here. What's he do in there? Who knows? All right. Who's hungry? Mac :  Senator Bob Banks is coming by your office tomorrow morning before service. Why? Is he asking for money for his campaign? Doesn't he know what we're going through right now? I tried to reschedule, but... I'm happy to have something to move on to, in all honesty. Well, maybe he's breaking up with that crazy wife of his. You remember the last time we were in Washington at their house? She was dressed like something out of "Star Wars." (all laugh) Who's Bob Banks? He's the senior senator from Tennessee. He's coming to church tomorrow morning to visit. I think he's coming to ask me about David Nelson, that trigger-happy cop. He's a member at Calvary? No, he's on the roll. So he's black? (chuckles) On the outside. Oh, Mac. (cell phone buzzes) James :  But, see, I think that Bob believes  this fella has confessed to me, given me some kind of privileged account about what really happened that night. But I've never even met the man. You said he's a member. Well, he is, but we have 4,000 people every Sunday, Gigi. I don't know half the people there. Now, can we talk about something else? I mean, I'm tired of borrowing trouble. - (laughter) Yes, Bishop. Yeah. What church do you go to in Phoenix? We're at Fountain of Life. Aw, they must be so blessed to have you, with all your experience. Yeah, well, I don't think they even know that I'm there, honestly. We pretty much just go Christmas and Easter. Really? Work keeps me pretty busy. Hmm. Oh, well, that's interesting. Are you still Christian? Jacob :  What? Come on. What is this, an inquisition? No, it's a conversation. (cell phone buzzes) It's something people have when they're in the same room and their phones are off. Sorry. Mother, may we be excused? Of course. Flee, flee! I would, too, if I wasn't anchored here by the demands of propriety. Lady Mae :  Oh! Come on, darling. Hey, Zora, sweetheart, where you guys going? Just around. Okay, stay together. We will. So, are you one of these people nowadays I hear so much about who are more spiritual than religious? Um... Mmm, whatever that means. No, I'd say I'm a Christian. Who believes what, though? I'm only asking because you say you don't go to church regularly. Well, I think there's lots of ways to commune with God, and not all of them take place in a church or a house of worship. Kerissa :  But the Bible commands Christians to go to church regularly. Or don't you believe in the Bible anymore? Or do you just cherry-pick what you like from it? I know that's the fashion now, too. Kerissa. Oh. I hope it's okay to talk about this. I'm just curious. Grace, she used to be this legendary preacher. She was. Thank you, Daddy. I wish I had heard her preach. Now here she's sitting  saying she doesn't even go to church anymore? I mean, I'm just curious. Kerissa... I think it best if we go on to something else. Yes. Please. Lady Mae :  No. Go on. I'm interested, too. What do you believe, Grace? Well, Mama, I believe that the Bible is one useful tool to see into the heart of God, in the Christian tradition. And what other tradition is there? Amen. Kerissa :  Jesus said, "I am the way, the truth, the life. No one comes to the Father except through me." Or do you not believe in Jesus anymore? Kerissa, come on, now. It's just a question. And we're all family. What do you believe, Gigi? I'm actually interested to know. Well, I guess I believe there's a part of everything that tries. You know, like plants try to grow, animals try to survive. People try to better themselves to get ahead. Everything tries to do something. And I guess I think that... Christianity is just one way that the trying part of people tries to connect with the trying part of everything else. Hear, hear. I'd go to that church. Me, too. Amen! I think that's marvelous. Thank you, Daddy. Really, Bishop? Really, and I don't see any reason why that couldn't be preached at Calvary. Lady Mae : Well, I will give you one, because it has nothing to do with Jesus and the price he paid on the cross for my sins. Amen. Amen. I've got an idea for a sermon. You do? Yes. Remember? I told you. Yeah. I've got an idea for a whole series of sermons, Daddy. It's a good one. Charity, we've been over this. I know, but you said that if I ever wanted to preach a series, I'd need a theme. And I've got a theme now  for a whole 12-part series. What is your theme, child? The seasons of Christian marriage. So, there are 12 seasons now? (laughter) James : So, tell me, what would that be about? You know, it would be about how things change  and grow deeper. And how with the help of God couples can push through tough times and experience all God has to offer. (Lady Mae laughs) Lady Mae : You've been married three years and you don't even have children. What do you know about tough times? I think it's a wonderful idea, Charity. Gigi, stay off of my team. Daddy, what do you think? Well, I... I think you're such a wonderful singer, Charity, such a powerful exalter. And you preach twice a month to the little saints in the children's church, right? Yeah. I'm a grown woman, Daddy. I want to preach a series, like Jacob, in the church on Sunday like a grown-up. Uh, Gigi. Daddy. How would you like to stay on and preach to the little saints? About what? Trying? Why won't you let me do a series? Jacob just did that one on running the race or race to the finish. Finishing God's holy race. It's not like he's good at it. What? Come on, Charity. Why won't you give me a chance? Your daddy's made his position clear, girl. Sit your ass down. Don't talk to her like that. Don't you talk to your uncle like that. Daddy, I think that Charity is just trying to... Gigi! How many times do I have to tell you I don't need you looking out for me? I don't want your help. Charity. Charity, baby. Go on, go on. If you all would excuse me. What? I told you I didn't want trouble. Mama, the truth is trouble to you, and it always has been. Don't you dare start in on me about the past, not when I just lost your sister. You didn't lose my sister, Mama. You gave her away! (gasps) Gigi... And you let him sit right here at the table next to you! James :  Gigi! I swear to God... That is enough! We don't talk like that in my house. We do not swear to God. This is not Arizona. You're going to church in the morning. Well, come on. (sighs) Good night, Gigi. Jacob. Uncle Mac. Uh-huh. I better be going. It's going to be a long drive home. So, how'd she look? Same. Older. Uh-huh. She's got nothing on you. You know, I could stay tonight if you want. Stay? Like, stay over? (chuckles) Yeah, like, don't act so surprised. I'm not, it's just... Do you not want me to? I know it's a strange time, but I thought you might like the company. I do. I want the company, totally. It's just... I thought we were waiting. We are waiting. Doesn't mean we can't wait together. Yeah. Stay. I'd like that. 
 
 Why the hell did you do that? Do what? Don't act like you don't know what I'm talking about. Why'd you get all up on Gigi like that? Because I know how your daddy thinks and I wanted to be sure that he knows she's not a preacher anymore. She's leaving Monday, Kerissa. But he wishes she wasn't. And meantime, you get treated every day like some kind of broken glass while Grace shines on in his memory crystal and complete. And you should be thanking me instead of getting all up in my face about it. I'm the best friend you got around here... the only real one. And you better tell that little side piece to stop texting so damn much. I won't be disrespected. Hey, baby. How you doing? I'm all right. And what was that all about? This 12-part sermon series that you've been planning for so long? I've thought about it. Seasons of Christian marriage? I swear. Was that all just to impress Gigi? You tell me. You're the one who was in such a hurry to go to her church. Aw, come on, baby. You know I didn't mean it. It's just that Kerissa was going at her so hard. You know me. Look, tell you what. Why don't we go upstairs, make a big bowl of ice cream... with chocolate syrup... cuddle up and watch "The Bachelor"? Yeah. Okay. I just can't believe she's gone. I know, baby. I know. (geese honking) So, what is this thing? An old lookout tower from the Civil War. Were there slaves here back then? Yeah, there were slaves all over Tennessee. This whole estate used to belong to an old lady called Miss Davis. When she was killed, it turned out that... Killed? Yeah. Are you serious? She was murdered. By who? Some random guys. What are you doing? Ritalin. Want some? (sniffs) Do you have ADD or ADHD? Neither, but I told my doctor I did. I was like, "I can't concentrate. I keep interrupting my friends when they talk. It's pissing them off." He still wouldn't give it to me, so I finally said, "If I don't start crossing things off my to-do list, I might hurt myself." Bam. Why do you take it? My mom's school. It's all you. (sniffs) (coughs) Nice form. If you don't keep your grades up or get in too much trouble, then you get in the red zone. Then your name goes up on a bulletin board in the lobby. My mom's the principal. I can't be in the red zone. Feel anything? I think so, yeah. Yeah. (spits) I love Jesus so much. What's the matter? It's just a lot harder than I thought, having you stay over. Why? I like it. So do I, but it's... you know, we're getting to that point where we can't do anything. Who says we can't do anything? We can't do one thing. That leaves a whole lot of options. Unless, of course, you don't like options. Oh, oh, oh, no. No. I'll take an option. (television chatter) I feel bad for Stacey G. Don't you? Hmm? Everybody knows he's going to pick Stacey B. Stacey G. is just somebody to say no to. - (TV turns off) What are you doing? They're just about to go into the fantasy suite. Do you want to have a baby? Do you? You want to now? I wouldn't ask if I didn't. I guess it would be a good time to... you know, make a new life. Yeah. Yeah, I think so, too. Yeah? Yeah. Okay. What, James? Did we do the wrong thing? We did the best we could. Yeah. (jazz music playing) (music continues) (chatter) Auntie. Oh. So good to see you. It's good to see you, too. Oh! Well, the place hasn't changed much. It's about to. I'm getting ready to renovate. Going to knock out that wall over there, add a new line of banquettes over there, new stage lights. Just waiting on the permit. I like it the way it is. Well, I will take a picture. Remember the first time you came in here? Yeah. We sat right here. Auntie, you know I was scared to death. Mama's always talking about her evil sister Mavis purveying the devil's music down on Beale Street. I figured I had to come see for myself. I used to make you those little Shirley Temples, remember? And you would sit and you would sip on them. So serious. Mmm. So dignified. Aw. You weren't anything like Mama said. Nothing is. Ugh. Did, um... did Faith ever come in here? She moved down to this neighborhood, right? She did. But after she moved out of the house, she started moving in her own circles. Yeah. Nothing you could do about that. Nothing. She had her own path, and we both know who's to blame for that. Yeah. So, what's going on? Man :  Hey, y'all! Give it up for Mr. Anthony David! Your Uncle Mac. What? (Anthony David singing) He did it again? Honestly, Gigi, I don't think he ever really stopped. Every couple of years you hear rumors about some girl he's mixed up with. Nothing ever comes of it. I didn't even bother to tell you. But two months ago, one of the cops who works around here came to see me and told me about a 15-year-old girl from the church who had come in and gave a statement. And what happened? Nothing. She recanted. After three days, said she made the whole thing up. Just like Faith. (singing continues) Why are you telling me this? Because right now I'm the only person in this family that knows that happened besides Mac. And you are the only one who can do something about it. Senator Banks and his aids is here to see you sir. Gentlemen, to what do I owe this pleasure? And if it has anything to do with that police officer David Nelson, I can't help you. It doesn't. Well, praise God, that's a blessing, 'cause Lord knows I've had enough heartache lately. The Senate is launching an inquiry, James, into whether your church and others like it are taking advantage of your tax-exempt status to bilk the American people out of billions of dollars. For real? For real. What? Well, I'm just wondering, what are white people going to think when they see black people picking on each other like this? What will black people think if we don't? There are white churches on there, too, James. Have a look. Give me that thing. Let me see. Where's Basie Skanks? His church is growing like a weed. He just said he was buying that old YMCA. We're not talking about Triumph Church or Basie Skanks. We're talking about you and Calvary. I don't see what's wrong. If everything is in order, there shouldn't be a problem. There isn't. Alexa, show the senator out, please. Right this way. (chattering) (organ tuning up) I got you. Hi. How's it going? Got everything under control? Yes, sir. All right. Jacob :  Alexa! Pastor Greenleaf. You got a minute? Your father needs his Bible. It'll only take a second. It's about the special offering. (gospel rock playing) Charity : ♪ Can you understand why ♪

(distant) Hallelujah! And amen! Amen! Now... Now, this goes back to when Lady Mae and me were still flying commercial. Never again. Thank you, Jesus. (chuckles) First lady says, "Never again, Thank you Jesus." And this man sees me poring over my Bible. I was getting ready for my sermon on Sunday. And he grunts at me, sipping on his wine, said, "Are you one of them Bible bangers?" I said, "Well, what's a Bible banger?" He said, "You know, one of those people that bangs people on the head with their Bible." (crowd groans) And this made me so sad  to think that's what the Bible is to some people, something they think someone's going to be beating on them with. Beating them on the head. Now, imagine that you were born in a real small town, and on the first day of kindergarten  you're standing on the milk line, and the little kid next to you in line  says hi and starts talking to you. And it turns out that he likes the same cartoons as you. Man : Yeah! The same flavor ice cream. Same video games. It's like you two were made for each other. So you start to go to each other's houses after school  and you become friends... best friends. Man :  That's right! That's right! And then when it comes time to graduate from high school, now you have to stay in town because of a family business and your friend goes off to college and then gets a job on the other side of the world. But you keep in touch, email each other once a week or so. And at the end of every email, you say, "I love you. I miss you. Please come home." After many years of this,  one day you get an email from your friend. He says, "I have some business going to take me through your area, and I was wondering if I could see you." Women :  Yes. So, on the day your friend is coming to visit, Now, all these people are coming through the doors. And you think, "Well, maybe there's a problem." (organ playing) "Maybe I got the date wrong." But then, way back...  at the back of this river of people, you see your friend. And, oh, how your heart fills! You see, the Bible is not a rulebook! The Bible is not a bunch of myths! It's not even a work of literature! (Charity singing) And it certainly isn't something to be banging people over the head with. The Bible, praise God, is like a bunch of emails from the best friend you ever had saying, "I love you! I miss you. Please, come home!" Woman :  Preach!

Well, I'm here to tell you, come on home! Come down here, because Jesus wants to welcome you home! (cheering, applause) James :  Come on! Come on down here. Come on down here. Come on, while there's still time! Come on! Come on down! Come on down here, child. Woman :  Praise Jesus. James :  That's right, come on. (chuckles) Oh, come on. Daddy. Come on, Gigi.
