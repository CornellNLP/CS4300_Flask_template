 Previously on Greenleaf. 
 Did you sleep with Grace? 
 (sobs) 
 I didn't say anything. 
 You didn't have to! You deserve each other. 
 I don't want to marry Grace. I want to marry you. 
 You can tell everyone at the mansion the wedding's off. 
 These people aren't my problem anymore. 
 You were going to just leave? 
 I was trying to give you two some space. 
 There is no "us two" anymore. 
 The wedding's off. 
 Woman on speaker :  And then what happened? 
 He held me down. I couldn't breathe. 
 I begged him not to do it. He wouldn't stop. 
 Turn it off. 
 She was just about to say exactly how Mac violated her. 
 I don't need any more evidence. 
 I want to hear his side of all this. 
 I will not have him tried in absentia. 
 And your blind spot when it comes to this girl will be your undoing, you mark my word, James. 
 Mae wasn't able to convince you. 
 You didn't convince her. 
 I never touched her. 
 Stop lying! Now! 
 (gunshot) 
 (thud) Gigi, I... It was an accident. I'm calling 911. Just wait, Grace. Give me and your daddy a minute. No. Give this to me. Mac :  I'm trying to do you a favor. Yeah, right, Mac. The second you dial that phone, the state's going to come marching in. And you don't want that to happen. Believe me, I know. You don't need to trust me. Daddy, why did you do this? What's going on in here? I heard... oh, Lord Jesus. Grace, you shot your uncle? No, I didn't... It was me, Mae. James. I'm calling the police. Mac :  Don't, Grace. It was an accident. Just get the first aid kit. First aid kit? The bullet went clear through. I just want to stop the bleeding. We have to get you to a hospital. And then to jail. Careful, little girl. I'll take your daddy with me. For what? For shooting the man who sexually assaulted his daughter? Believe me, I think most juries would understand. That's not what he means. (Mae stammers) Just give us five minutes. Excuse me? Mae : What just happened? Grace, just go get the first aid kit. I'm not going anywhere. Woman, give me five minutes. And then we're calling the cops. Pastor Greenleaf, What are you doing with a gun? Are you two okay? No, we're not okay. I told you to keep an eye on that girl, and instead you... well, I don't have to tell you what you did. You both know. Grace, what happened? Daddy shot Mac. Dead? No. Has anyone called the cops? No. Where's the first aid kit? In the break room, why? Oh, Lord Jesus. Lord God. I know I haven't been perfect, and I know I've fallen short of what you intended me to be as a woman and a mother, and I repent of my sin... all of it. Right now, Jesus, just tell me what to do. Pastor, what was that sound? The bishop. Don't tell me... Everyone's okay. Just make sure no one else comes down this hall. ♪ Every long-lost dream ♪ 
♪ Led me to where you are ♪ 
♪ Others who broke my heart ♪ 
♪ They were like northern stars ♪ 
♪ Pointing me on my way ♪ 
♪ Into your loving arms ♪ 
♪ This much I know is true ♪ 
♪ That God blessed the broken road ♪ 
♪ That led me straight to you. ♪ Perfect. Thank you, everybody. Don't forget, we're going to gather at the gazebo by the lake at 3:00 for one last rehearsal. Wedding starts at 5:00 sharp. And take heed, y'all. Studies show that nine times out of ten, what people remember most about the wedding is the music. Is that true? I don't know. It sounds true. (phone buzzing) Oh, I got to get home. The cocktail party is about to start. If it's not one thing with this wedding, it's another. Bye, y'all. Bye. Do you see the chaos you've brought into this church? This family? Are you happy now? David Nelson's dead. Your uncle's been shot. Now you sucked your father into this web of confusion. I did not tell Daddy the shoot Mac. But you knew. You knew. You had to know he would do something like this. At least tell the truth to yourself. The rest of us will get by. Here. Knock yourselves out. You ready? James, tell me what is going on. I'm sorry, Mae. I can't. Gigi... Daddy, don't tell me not to call. I don't have a choice. What are you talking about? Trust me. Don't call. We can figure this out on our own, Gigi, if you just give me a little time. I gave you 20 years. Gigi. No! Time's up. (line ringing) Woman :  911. What is your emergency? This is Pastor Grace Greenleaf at Calvary Fellowship. Somebody's been shot. ♪ Amen ♪ 
♪ Amen ♪ (vocalizing) ♪ Well ♪ (vocalizing) ♪ Amen, amen, ooh. ♪ (police radio chatter) I'm sorry. There. That's good. That works. So, look, I'm thinking since the party's off, after we put Winkie down, we can maybe rope in Zora and play a little bit of whist? Yeah. Yeah? Yeah, if she's up for it. All right. I'll go see. Hey! Question for you. What the... Zora. I was going to ask if you wanted to play a bit of whist with us later. Knock first. Sorry. So, you want to play? No. What's the matter with her? Hmm. I'll talk to her. Good job, Wink. All right, good. Yeah, you're good with the side pieces. Your daddy is an expert on those. Oh, really? Okay. Good joke, though. That's pretty funny. Noah :  You know all those people we just sent home? Grace : Yeah? They're not going to keep quiet about this. They say they might, but... I know. It's not ideal. (phone ringing) Hey, honey, what's up? Where are you? I'm at work. I'm just wrapping a few things up. I just went down to Noah and Isabel's party. No one's here. Yeah, there's a reason for that. There's not going to be a wedding. Why? I don't know. Well, some friend of his from Huntsville is down there with his wife. Should I tell them? I don't know. Hold on a sec. What is it? Some friend of yours from Huntsville is at the house. Oh. Dan? Is it Dan? Yeah, Dan and Betty. Dan and Betty? Tell her I'll call them right now. Noah's going to call right now. Are you okay for a minute? Yeah, I'm fine. Go. And can we talk when you get home? Sure, honey, about what? Uncle Mac. Please tell me he didn't do anything to you. No, he didn't. Thank God. But Zora told me what's going on and you didn't. We'll sit down and talk the minute I get home, honey, okay? Okay? Okay. Did I miss something? So, Betty, you're also an engineer as well, then, like Dan here? Sort of. I make agricultural robots. (phone ringing) Mostly that clean chicken coops. Interesting. It's Noah. (phone ringing) Oh, good. Maybe he can tell us where everyone is. Noah, what's the deal? The wedding's been called off. That can't be true. Someone would've told me. Melisse, did you hear anything? No. It's been called off. I know how you feel. I'm always the last person to hear things, too. That's all of it. Are you sure? I don't want you leaving anything behind that he can be sentimental about. There's no evidence of a bride or bridesmaids. I even took the pictures of us at Graceland off the fridge. Graceland? (sighs) (no audible dialogue) Hey. Dan, I am so sorry. I called so many people. I just spaced. It's all right. We had dinner. You're the one we're worried about. Hey. Grace, why didn't you call and tell me? Charity, it's not my wedding. We sat here for two hours with those people and then we had to finally hear it from them. What do you want me to say? I'm sorry? Yeah. Gigi. Mama just called from the jail. The jail? What's going on? Did she say why she was there? Yeah. Why is Mama in jail? Look, she's not. I'm sorry. Don't. You did the right thing. What right thing? All right, all right. Take it easy, babe. Don't tell me to take it easy. Why is Mama in jail? Could you tell her? I have to go explain it all to Sophia. All right. Thank you. Why don't you two ever tell me anything? Why am I always the last one to know what's going on? Because this is how you act. Did you know when we moved here? Yeah, I did. And you didn't tell me? I told you as much as I thought you needed to know. I said to keep your distance. Yeah, but that's a different thing from saying that someone's actually... Why didn't you just tell me? I don't... I didn't tell you because I thought if you knew... knew the real reason why I came back, that your dad would somehow find out. And if he knew... ...he wouldn't let you come with me. You know, whenever I wake up in the morning and I feel like I got broken early on and I'll never, ever get fixed, I walk into your room and I see you sleeping, and I see the good thing that you are... ...and I know that I did one thing right. And I didn't want to risk losing that. So, I'm sorry. Come here. I'm sorry, honey. What? I called Dad. He's coming tomorrow. Well, I spoke with your daughter. And what was all that about? Well, I think this thing with Mac has affected her more than she wants to let on. You might have to keep your distance for a while... and knock. I guess I can do that. It's all just a little sad, you know? Right when I want to be closer to her, she wants to be farther away. Hey. What? You're a good dad. Say that again. You're a good dad. Thank you. 
 
 (door opens) I'm on my way to the airport. Can we talk? Well, at least all these berries didn't go completely to waste. What a consolation. Good morning. Is it? I've got something to say to you. All right, I'm out. Don't move. All right. I am not a second-class citizen around here. I am not someone who can be ignored or left out... Charity... - Mama, let me finish for once. If you had told me what you were doing here, I could've helped. How, Charity? Don't say it like that. Mae :  Oh, just stop it, all of you, please! Your father is in jail, and you're going on about some berries, and this one's up on her feet like her dignity's at stake. It is, Mama! And whence is this dignity if it isn't from a proper sense of horror at what your sister has done to your father? Who are you? I'm the only child you have that hasn't lied, cheated, or done anything but serve this church! You've been here the whole time Mac was pulling this nonsense and you never even noticed? Who are you? Don't. I need to be alone. She's not wrong. Well, I am off to collect your father... ...from the jail, if you can imagine. Oh, Melisse, the, uh... Are you bailing him out? Mac didn't press charges. Mama, can I help at least? Can I drive you? I mean, there's going to be media and all kind of... Son, that's sweet of you to offer, but, no. Your father and I have a lot to discuss before we meet with the deacon board. I'll be fine. A storm is about to befall this family. The kind of storm that takes down trees, shuts down power,  and washes people and whole houses away. But it's just a storm. It will pass. Well. Thank you, Melisse. On that note... Yeah. Family. Yeah. I got stuff to do, too. See you, baby. Bye, sweetie. Bye, Kev. Jacob. When I was dating Jacob, my father sat me down and told me how much I had to up my game if I was going to land me that Greenleaf boy. Can you believe that? There I was, graduating Spelman summa cum laude, and he had me checking myself to make sure I was good enough for this family. I don't know. What the Lord must make of all this mess so close to Heaven's front door. I guess we'll find out, huh? I'm sorry. You should be. Here's the thing. I think what we had is too valuable to just throw away without even trying. It is to me, anyway. Okay. I'm going to go stay with my mom for spring break. I don't want you to call me or text me. I won't. When I get back, if you want to talk about regaining my trust and growing into the man I know you can be, I'll listen. See, I don't think you love Grace. And don't say whether you do or not. You don't know how you feel. I think what you're in love with is the past. But the past is gone. (door opens, closes) Not that it's a major concern given all that's going on, but I was wondering, who's going to be preaching Sunday? Is Jacob still sat down? As far as I know. Grace :  That's my understanding. Well, I'm going to be frank. I'm going to recommend that once the bishop gets here, that he reinstates Jacob. I mean, we can't have a man  who shot someone preaching. We don't know what happened yet. Well, we know there were shots fired in the church office. We know that Mac is in Memphis General. We know that he was shot with the bishop's gun. It doesn't do the Gospel any favors to be preached by men of bad reputation. (door opens) Well, God is good! All : All the time. I guess y'all want to know why I'm smiling. We all know that old Gospel truth... it's in the darkest time that the light of God shines brightest. And I have to say, as I stand before you today, I feel oddly refreshed. Now, it might be because I spent the last night in jail praying like Paul for the souls of those I couldn't reach. Or it just might be this cool sunny day. Either way, God is God, and we go on. Would you excuse us, Pastor? What do you mean? I'd like you to leave. Bishop? I'll be right with you. Pastor? First Lady? Yes, Misty? Is this cake from Sweet William? Yes, it is. I wanted to get one for my granddaughter's graduation, but it was so expensive. Was it a gift? Yes, it was. From who? Mr. McCready. Bishop :  Now, in case y'all were wondering, I'm still in charge here. Pastor Greenleaf, you know the meeting with the deacon board is right now. I do know that. Thank you. You're not attending? I was attending. I was excused. By the deacons. By the bishop. Oh. Yeah. Vida heard from the detectives. She's going in to see them today. Oh, that's good. Danielle said the same thing, so it'll all come out. Yes, finally. Grace. Do you have a 10:00 I'm not aware of, Pastor? Darlene... ...this is Sophia's father, Ray. Oh, nice to meet you, Ray. Nice to meet you, too, Darlene. I can tell from that look on your face you've never even heard about me. That's not true. Sure, it is. It's okay. Not your fault. Got a minute, Pastor? All this just happened? Last night. A week ago a cop is killed in the parking lot of this place, and now your dad just shot another guy? Yeah. I'm taking her back to Phoenix. Just the plane ride alone would be more time than you spent with her in the past five years, so go for it. I'm not kidding this time. Neither am I. Grace, our custody agreement says I am to be consulted if you take her across the state line. That you didn't was enough for me to take you to court and win, but I didn't do that. You didn't even think to call her until we had been here for a month. You really want to argue about this right now? You put her under the same roof as a man that you knew was capable... No. He does not live at the house. The way she tells it, he's there every day. Hmm? What were you thinking? What do you want... what do you want me to say, Ray? That I screwed up? I screwed up. I want you to say, "Ray, I've treated you like you're the problem ever since our daughter was born. But you're not. I am." I'm going to go see her and we're going to talk. What is there to talk about? Whatever I want. Don't you get it? This whole "You don't have any rights, Ray"? That's over, because you did screw up. You did. (phone ringing) Greenleaf residence. Man :  Hi. Who am I speaking to? Melisse. May I ask who's calling? Dave Wallace, "Memphis Daily News." Melisse, can you confirm there was a shooting at Calvary last night? I'll tell you what, Melisse. You don't have to say yes. If you can confirm it, just stay on the line and say nothing, all right? Okay. Kevin :  Charity. Hey, baby. How's it going? Good. Look, I got to tell you, baby, I was so proud of you this morning, standing up to your mama like that. You were? Honest? Yeah, girl. That was impressive. Then you'll really like this. Until you come clean with me about whatever's been going on with you, I want you out of our bed. Charity, you want to see my phone, baby? Here. And if you don't do it soon, Kevin, I want you out of the house. Charity, here. Look at my phone. I don't want to see your phone! I want to see somebody behind your eyes I can trust, and I don't. Impressed? (beep) Karine, would you please tell the bishop that I'm going to run by the hospital and then I'll meet him at the house? Karine? Lord have mercy. That girl... (ringing) Hello? Wallace :  Hello. To whom am I speaking? To whom am I speaking? Dave Wallace, "Memphis Daily News." I was just looking for someone at the church to confirm a few facts. I'm aware that this can be a little daunting. Just know we already have an independent source at the house who's confirmed everything. My editor just asked me to double down with someone from the church. An independent source? That's right, ma'am. (rain pattering) So, you go to church twice a week? Yeah. Wow. Well, Wednesday night isn't really a whole service. It's more teaching. And how long does that one last? Two hours. Then there's choir practice and youth group. And you like going to all this church stuff all week long? It beats Paradise Valley Mall. What's that supposed to mean? Well, back in Phoenix, most Sundays I'd go meet my friends there. And it felt like fun when we were there, but when I got home, all I could think about was did I buy the right top? Did I keep my receipt? Who can I trust? And how am I ever going to get enough money for that other... whatever. And I could never sleep those nights. I'd just lay there thinking and be so tired all day Monday. When I get home from church on Sunday, all I can think about is how I can be a better person. And I sleep. I don't know. Seems to me like a bunch of people who talk about being holy all the time and then do bad things just like everybody else. It is. But it's not just that. The new place I just opened up, it's doing really well. Yeah? Yeah, been in Eater.com and Chowhound. I know you've seen the pictures I've sent, but when you're there and it's full of people? I think you'd really like it. I'm sure I would. I got a condo with a pool. Cool. You're really happy here, huh? Yeah, Dad, I am. I wish Mom had told me. She should've told both of us. Thank you for coming. Thanks for calling. Zo? Zozo? Time for dinner. Zora? You are a very polite young man. You could have a future in this company. Mark my words. You. Tell your grandfather. (footsteps) Grace : Hi, Karine. Is my father in? He doesn't want to see you. He said that? Mm-hmm. Mae, how'd you get them to let you in? The boy they have keeping guard is Connie's nephew Cameron. But he said I have to be quick. Yeah, you're going to have to be. Lawyer friend of mine is coming by in a little bit to talk about my plea. Robert... please don't drag us through court. Please. I'm not going to. Just trying to figure out how to keep all this to a minimum in terms of years. Thank you. What are you doing here, Mae? What? I'm here... I came here because the Lord said that I have to forgive you. But now that I'm sitting here, I don't think I can. I hate what you did so much, Robert. I hate what it's costing the people I love, what it cost my little girl Faith and... the thoughts in her head while you were doing whatever you did to her, the screaming in her soul that she had to die just to make go away that you put there. You put there! I hate you so much. And I know that if I don't forgive you, the Lord will never forgive me and deliver my family from all of this. But I don't think I can. Lord, I'm sorry. So, what time's your flight? (television chatter) 11:00. It's a red-eye with a connection through Denver. (turns TV off) What are you going to do? I'm not sure. She says she likes it here. Yeah, she does. What? It just makes it hard, that's all. I'm sure that was part of your plan all along. What are you talking about? Getting her here. Getting her used to the place. So it would seem like I'm the bad guy if I came back to take her home. This is her home now. No, it isn't. I'm going to let her finish out the school year, and after that, she's coming back with me to Phoenix. You can't take her from me. You could come, too, if you want, but I'm not letting her stay here. The day we met, you told me that this place was evil. What can I say? You were right. (snoring) Charity? Good night, babe. (buzzing) (continues buzzing) (chimes) (chimes)
