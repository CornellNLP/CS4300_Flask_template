 Previously on Greenleaf. 
 Job 3:26. 
 "I am not at rest,  nor am I quiet." 
 Pastor Skanks? 
 Pastor Greenleaf. 
 Bishop send you over here to put me in my place? 
 No, I came on my own. 
 Why? You looking for a job? 
 I could be, yeah. 
 Grace Greenleaf? 
 Yeah, that's me. 
 How can I help you? 
 What is it? 
 Ray wants custody of Sophia. 
 We have had Women's Day at the Peabody Hotel every year for 35 years. 
 Well, then somebody needs to get the deacon board here to sign the check. 
 I look forward to working with you, Kevin. 
 Yeah, me, too. 
 Who are you? 
 I'm the only child you have that hasn't lied. 
 I was so proud of you this morning, standing up to your mama like that. 
 Then you'll really like this. 
 Until you come clean with me about whatever's been going on with you, I want you out of our bed. 
 Hey. 
 Hey. 
 Where are you off to so early? 
 I'm meeting Carlton for a walk around the lake. 
 Wait up a second. 
 I don't want to be late. 
 What am I still doing down here, Charity? 
 Living the private life you enjoy. 
 It's not very private. 
 Well, you're not coming back to my bed. 
 Why? Because of a phone? 
 Tone. 
 It's not the phone, and you know it. 
 It's us. 
 It's the way we feel. 
 How about the way I feel? 
 I'm those babies' daddy. 
 I know. 
 And I wish you'd act like it. 
 That's what I'm trying to do. 
 No, what you're doing is telling me how it's going to be, and it's not. 
 What do you want me to say? 
 I got to go. 
 Is Basie asking Bishop for permission to hire you? 
 No. 
 Well, that's what it sounds like,  coming to Bishop on bended knee to ask for my husband's hand. 
 No, he's just being up front about it. 
 That's how he does things. 
 Hmm. 
 I know what this is about. 
 What is this about? 
 The fact that Alexa goes to Triumph now, right? 
 That's it, isn't it? 
 Look, baby, that's over. 
 I don't want anybody else ever again. 
 I love when you wear these sleeveless dresses. 
 You got the sexiest arms in the world. 
 You know if Bishop does say yes, we're going to have to move, right? 
 There's no way your mother's going to let us stay here. 
 You and me, we'll work it out. 
 (muffled rap music playing) 
 Zora! 
 (music continues) 
 Zora, turn that music down! 
 (music continues) 
 So, what do I say? 
 Just that you want to live with me. 
 With Dad standing right there? 
 I don't know. 
 (phone ringing) 
 Man. 
 Who's that? 
 It's your Aunt Mavis. 
 Have you seen her since Uncle Mac got arrested? 
 Or even talked to her? 
 No, but I've been dealing with this, you know? 
 Hey, stranger. 
 Hey. 
 You guys look great together. 
 Thanks, so Sophia wants to know if Ray has to be present when she testifies. 
 Not if you don't want him to be. 
 Okay. 
 (knocks) 
 Connie. 
 How's the decorating going? 
 It's an awfully big room, Mae. 
 Oh, well, we have a hundred women signed up. 
 We're down to 86, actually. 
 Oh. So, can we cut the room in half? 
 We can, and that boy in charge showed me what that would look like. 
 Not the effect you want. 
 So, what would you suggest? 
 Well, Felicia's daughter Roxanne works at the Riverbluff on Union. 
 The Riverbluff? Connie! 
 It's just been renovated, and they've got a smaller event room that we can get for a third... 
 But I paid half the deposit for the Peabody ballroom myself. 
 It's not just about the money. 
 It's about showing the deacons that you and James understand. 
 Understand what? 
 How bad things have gotten. 
 Misty Williams said that having Women's Day at the Peabody is like fiddling while Rome burns. 
 Misty Williams? 
 And she's not the only one who has that opinion, either. 
 I'm not going to the Riverbluff. 
 I'll make you a deal. 
 I'll keep Misty quiet if you get James to let Grace preach for the summer. 
 Grace? 
 She's almost destroyed the church! 
 If Rome is burning, it's because she set it on fire. 
 Well, that girl also raked in the single largest offering of the year, and the church needs money. 
 James is the church. 
 Nobody's talking about replacing the bishop for good. 
 Don't get all dignified. 
 It'll just be temporary. 
 You sound like it's decided. 
 Well, I hope so. 
 We can't go through another three months like the last one. 
 No. 
 I'll talk to James. 
 Thank you, Mae. 
 I knew you'd listen to reason. 
 I told Misty you would. 
 I know I haven't been a perfect parent by any means. 
 I've had my struggles, obviously. 
 But I've been clean and sober now for eight years, and this whole thing with Grace  bringing Sophia here without my knowledge,  it's been a real wake-up call. 
 All I want is a chance to be a better father while there's still time. 
 Thank you, Mr. Fisher. 
 Now, if everyone will please excuse us, I'd like to have the CASA and the younger Miss Greenleaf remain. 
 Hey, how you doing, Pastor? 
 Does it usually take this long? 
 Sometimes. 
 Okay. 
 Here we go. 
 Ma'am. 
 Judge :  Bottom line, based on everything I've heard today,  I'm recommending that at the end of the school year, which I understand is two weeks from today, Miss Greenleaf be remanded into the custody of her father  for a period of no less than 90 days,  after which time the requirements of the original shared custody agreement will once again obtain. 
 This court is in recess. 
 ♪ Amen ♪ 
♪ Amen ♪ 
 (vocalizing) 
 ♪ Well ♪ 
 (vocalizing) 
 ♪ Amen, amen, ooh. ♪ So, what are we going to tell them? The truth. Wich part of it? You came looking for me, and you said you were looking for a job. We want to show him the respect he deserves. Mmm. God is good. Don't you worry, Pastor. I'm not worried. Sophia. Sophia? Sophia, honey. Come on. What did you say in there? That I wanted to live with you. Is that all you said? Yeah, basically. Basically or that's all you said? That's basically all I said. And then he said, "I appreciate that you feel that way, Miss Greenleaf, but your mother broke the law." Can I take this girl to lunch? Or do you have to get to school? Just have her back there by one. Will do. Come on. So, does this mean that if he doesn't want her to live here after the summer's over, that I can't either? Not if you want to see her. (car engine starts) (no audible dialogue) I just think I'm ready to make a move, up my game. And the pastor here seems like he's ready to do the same. Why not join forces? And you came here to inform me? Because I know if Jacob's in a secretive state of mind where he can't give 100 percent,  I won't be getting my money's worth, and the Lord won't either. Mm-hmm. You know, at the end of the day, getting the Gospel into the peoples' hearts is the mission. I'm not concerned with who's at whose church or whatever. Oh, obviously. And I just know that having your blessing is going to empower this man to take up his mantle  in a whole new ministry,  and that excites me. So, what do you say? Well, from a purely objective standpoint, seems like a good opportunity for the both of you. Yes, Lord. I wish it wasn't in Memphis. With Kerissa's school being here,  your options are limited. You know, it actually might be a great sign of unity, after all Calvary and Triumph have been through, to be bound together in this way. Well, you have my blessing. Amen. Would you excuse us, Pastor? Oh, by all means. Bishop. You're going to have to tell your mother. I know. I never will understand how you drink that. What is it? It's whey. Unh-uh. Try it. No. It has no flavor. Which means it tastes like a mouth. Yuck. It's good for you. Any word from TACS? Between me and you, no. And I thought with the higher test scores that the turnaround time would be quicker. Maybe they're giving us an award. Yeah, they can keep the award, okay? And just send me my accreditation papers. We don't get that accreditation by the deadline... We'll get accredited. You got a feeling? Yeah. Mm-hmm. Okay. (phone ringing) But I'll send up a prayer anyway. Well, every little bit helps. Hi, handsome. Well, how did it go? If you think Davina is going to be leading the singing while you're having those babies, you are tripping. I would sooner FaceTime you in, put you up on that screen pushing... ♪ Joy to the world... You are crazy. Oh. Let me catch up with you in a minute. Okay, but that's my final decision. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. And it was over in, like, ten minutes. We even prayed afterward. Hey, look, Charity just walked in. Let me talk to her and I'll give you all the details when I get home, okay? Love you. Before you say anything, no one left you out of anything. Who didn't leave me out of what? What's going on around here? I'm shipping out. To go where? I took a job at Triumph. What? Yeah, you heard right. I'm going to be associate pastor over there. Jake, you can't do that. Who says? Does Daddy know? He's fine with it. I find that hard to believe. Just sat down with me and Basie Skanks and gave me his blessing. Basie Skanks was in this building? Yeah. Does Mama know about it? No, and don't tell her, either. Look, I'll sit down with her soon and explain it all. Jake, she's going to throw you out of the house. You know that, right? Maybe it's time to go. Look, I'm sorry I didn't tell you sooner, but we just decided this morning. Jacob... We're still going to see each other, right? I got to go. I got to do something. I know. I guess... I just don't know what to say. Try congratulations. Congratulations. Jerk. Hey. Hey. I just talked to our partners about the possibility of an appeal... Okay. ...and this seems to be the consensus. You're going to have to give her up for the summer. And as far as appealing the terms of the original agreement... It's hopeless. No, it's just not easy. You can appeal the ruling by filing a motion for reconsideration, but you may end up with the same judge. And even if you don't, by the time you're done fighting, Sophia will be in college. What if I take her to Mexico? You're not the first client of mine to say that this week, actually. I was kidding. He was not. And just so you know, you go to jail. I can't believe that he can literally ignore her for months at a time for years and then just get her like this. Well, normally, he couldn't. But I broke the law, I know. I really am a Greenleaf. So, what do you want to do? Draw up a draft of the motion Okay. Okay. No worries. Thanks, Mike, for doing all of this. I'll stop by tomorrow so you can see what it looks like. Okay. (intercom beeps) Man :  Mavis McCready for you. Call back. (chuckles) Got a minute, Daddy? For you? Always. What can I do for you, child? Well, Jacob told me he's leaving. For browner pastures, yeah. Are you okay with that? No, but when you have children, there comes a day when, just like the Lord did with Adam and Eve, you just have to let them wander down off into the garden. It's the only way. I'll tell you what. Why don't you... why don't you take his office once he's out of there? Are you sure? Oh, positive. You work so hard, and I know you get tired with those babies. You deserve a little private place to rest. If you're sure. Charity, to see you in that office will be the silver lining I've been praying for all day. Okay. Thank you, Daddy. Oh, my pleasure. (computer chimes) Under no circumstances should you let him in the building. Lady Mae does not want him in the building, period. Hey. FYI? Really? Can you guys close that for me, please? Thanks. You got my email. Yeah. I just wanted you to know that Isabel was going to be at Women's Day. So, come and tell me to my face. Are you guys getting back together? Why are you making such a big deal out of this? Are you? We're talking about it. What? Nothing. I thought I'd be at the Southern Poverty Law Center for the rest of my life. You know, Yale, that's kind of like the Emerald City, and I love Montgomery. So, what happened? I was stupid. I got involved with a guy that got transferred out here, and I sent out my resume, and, well, I won't do that again. 
 
 So, here we are. Yeah, uh... it's a nice place. Yeah. You know, I got to tell you, I appreciate you bringing us into the church, but I was relieved when it ended. I mean, I hope that wasn't too obvious. Relieved because... You know, for the freedom to do this... and whatever happens next. Okay, um... What? Look, I think you have the wrong idea about me. No, don't do that. Don't do what? Why are we at dinner? Because... I don't know. Look, Adrian, I'm not gay. Okay. All right. So, you do a guy sometimes. You know, I get it. I don't do that. I've told you, I've never done it. So, you're telling me you've never flirted with me? Adrian, I'm straight... and married. Yeah, with two babies on the way. I know. Have you seen your office? Oh, we're not going to do any of that until tomorrow... HR, the whole thing. But, really, the offices over there, they aren't anything special. He puts all his money into programs. Hmm. It's fun to see you so inspired. It's fun to be inspired. You know, if ten percent of the people over there at that church are as cool as he is,  it's going to be a whole new life, baby. So, I'll be back in about an hour. I think I got ten miles in me today. Well, you can make it eight and save two for me. Hell, yeah. Well, how about I run two and save the other eight for you? Okay, that works, too. (knocking on door) (knocking on door) Well, look who exists. Hey, Mama. Behold the future of Calvary. May I? Yeah. I just had dinner, so they're doing their karate moves in there. Oh! He loves you. Mama, can I ask you a question? You may. Is there something wrong with Daddy? What do you mean? I saw him today, and it seemed like his hand was shaking or something. Is he all right? You'll have to ask him. So, there is something wrong. Ask him. Mama. There's no need for you to worry. You stay positive. Those boys feel everything you feel... everything. Have the two of you started picking names? Sorry, I can go back upstairs. No, no. I was just going to bed. Night, Mama. Love you. Good night. In all my years of marriage, I never put Bishop on the sofa. And if I had, he wouldn't have let it go on this long. I know, Ma. I tried. Try? You better stop trying and do something, boy. Make this right. It's not entirely up to me. Charity's hard work, Ma. What you want? Kevin, I have no idea what is going on with the two of you. But here's what I know. It is up to you. You're the man. Don't you understand that your children are already existing inside that woman? Already forming in this cloud of unpleasantness? Your boys need to feel safe and secure right now, not anxious and unsettled and sad. Trust me, you will disappoint your children sometimes, but there's no need to start so soon. Okay. When did this happen? I got the notice of seizure from the city a couple months ago. And you didn't call and tell me? And what would you have done? Can you fight it? I tried,  but whoever Mac has in his pocket at city hall ain't budging. They gave me a nice check, though. I'm so sorry. Don't be. You know, I knew when I gave you that police report that I was poking in a beehive, so I surely cannot act surprised now that I got stung. No, but you can still say ouch. So, how come it's been so hard to get ahold of you these days? And I don't want to hear, "I've been so busy." I don't want to leave. Not yet, anyway. Why? I don't know, exactly. You feeling bad because things are all falling apart? Don't. Your family's still your family. That church deserves to close. I'm not so sure about that. After what they did to Faith? Pushing her truth down into the dark  just so they can keep a shine  on that silver-plated cross? My parents are the ones that did that to her, not the church. The church did that to them. The church did that to them. I know you love your daddy, but, Gigi, that church, I mean, just keeping the doors open turned him into some two-bit hustler and my sister some preening swan. And they go on and on, the Lord this and Jesus, but it's really just all about the money. Money, money, money. It is so much more than that. It is not. You came, you saw, and you conquered. Get out. I'll come and get you in the Mustang when school's done. . We'll drive back with the top down. 2,000 miles? Yeah. We'll stop anywhere you want. Already made arrangements with my chefs to cover me for two weeks. It'll be fun. Okay. I'm not going to apologize, because I don't think I've done anything wrong. She doesn't want to leave, Ray. Same old Grace. It's always everybody else's hard time. I'm going to appeal. And drag her from courtroom to courtroom from here to Phoenix and back again over and over? Why? I'm not asking for anything that isn't within my rights to ask for. You screwed up. Deal with it. I'm sorry, honey, that's the truth. Dad. Yes, sweetie? I don't want to leave. Come here. Hey, I'll see you in two weeks. Come on, sweetheart. Sweetheart. Sweetheart? Mr. Dorsey, do you have a second? Please. Release me. Let me go. Did you hear from TACS? No. My husband has just taken a position as associate pastor at Triumph. Very cool. Yeah. I just wanted to tell you. He'll be around. We'll be around. Then I look forward to meeting this man I've heard so much about. You understand why I'm telling you. Completely. I'll keep a respectful distance and treat any bit of news as if it's just that... news. Thank you. No worries. (bell rings) Just promise me he won't start moonlighting as a teacher next. I don't want to lose my lunch buddy. I promise. Hmm. So, when did all this happen? A couple weeks ago. But Daddy signed off on it yesterday, so I wanted to be the one to tell you in person. Uh-huh. Well, I would have preferred being consulted before it became  fait accompli. Mama, I didn't want to to give you a chance to try to talk me out of it. Like I could. Mama, you can talk a rose out of smelling pretty. And just so you know, Kerissa and I have been looking for places in town. What for? Because we're going to need a place to live. Jacob, what kind of day would it be if I didn't see Winkie eating his cereal in the morning when I came downstairs? Don't be silly. You'll stay at the house. Hmm? Thank you, Mama. Well... hmm. What's that? This is a motion to appeal the ruling the judge made yesterday. Don't send it in. Why not, honey? Because... I don't want to go to court again. That wasn't fun. So, we'll both move back to Phoenix. No! I'm not switching schools. I just made friends here. It's bad enough I have to go there for the summer. Sophia, if your dad doesn't want you to live here, I can't do anything about it unless we go to court. I hate this! Oh, I know, come here. Come here. I know. No. I'm going to go call Zora. (Sophia sobbing) I was just about to come to bed. Or I could just sit right here and listen to whatever you have to say. Connie Sykes came to me yesterday, James, with a suggestion, the unpalatability of which cannot be measured. Grace preaching. Yes. And she calls herself my friend. I told her that wasn't happening. Now Misty Williams is saying things. James, we have to get on the same page or Calvary's going to fly off in a hundred different directions! Your only son is going off to work at another man's church. There's nothing for him here. No, it's fine. I'm not going to get into it now. He's off to Triumph. But in the meantime, you're not well. Things are falling through the cracks every day that Mac is in jail. You know they are. And Gigi, the girl that's betrayed the both of us, she's their sweet hope of what's going to save this church and turn it around? I'll talk to Connie again. And here's what you're going to tell her. I am going to preach. Not you, not Grace. Me. Just for a while, James. Mae, it's one thing to preach a sermon once a year about healthy living and a godly lifestyle. Are you saying I can't do it? I'm saying you haven't done it. Why don't we give Amos Andrews a call? I'm sure he'd be happy to do a series. No. No. The way the jackals are circling right now? No. We need a Greenleaf in the pulpit. We can't move from the spot! And it's not going to be that hellcat of a daughter of mine. That's not going to happen... unless you come clean to me about what Mac's got on you. I'll let Connie know. (knocking on door) Can we talk? Send me an email. Hey. Hey. Can we talk? If you have something to say. Charity, I love you. I love you, too. Is that all? No. What, then? Something has been going on. And I've been hiding it in my phone. You were right. But, I, uh... I want to talk to you about it. Okay. The fact is, I don't want to talk to you about it. I want to put it behind me, but... I have to tell you if I want to be with you. That's true. And being with you and those babies is what I want, Charity. You got to believe me. So, what is it? What do you have to tell me? Whatever it is, we can deal with it. Just tell me the truth. I've been having feelings... About another woman. (exhales) No. So... so, what... I haven't done anything. I figured they're just feelings. And I have prayed. Baby, I've been praying. What... But they won't go away. What kind of feelings? What kind of feelings? Uh... Kevin! Feelings about... ...about men. What does that mean? Kevin, what does that mean? I don't know. Look, but I love you. I want help. I want to fix this. I want to fix this. Are you gay? I don't know. Why... why would you do this? You're such a liar. Baby, I love you. How can you? I do! What does that even mean? You sit here and tell me you have feelings about men and you love me? I love you. What does that mean? Please! What does that... (sobbing) You're a liar! I hate you! (screams, gasps) Are you okay? (screams) Help! The thing is, I think I sent you that email because I was angry. At me? No, not at you. At life. Before you came back, I was really cool with Isabel. Like, I loved her. I wasn't thinking about you. But then you showed up, and I thought that that life that I had dreamed about as a little kid, that perfect life that I'd almost given up on, was suddenly possible again. (sirens approaching) But... (sirens continue) Do you hear that? Yeah. What's going on? What happened? Something's wrong with the twins. Baby, you just stay calm. Remember, all things work together for good for those who love the Lord. What's wrong with the babies, Gigi? I don't know. Mae :  We'll be there, sweetheart. We're going to come right now. Kevin? Kevin... Man :  Anybody know what hospital they're going to? (beeping) Doctor :  Well, they're stable for now. Oh, thank God. But your blood pressure is high. I want to keep you overnight. Whatever they need. I just want them to be healthy. Are you under a lot of stress? No. No more than most people. Doctor, she works seven days a week, and our family's been going through a lot of stress over the last few months, and her husband is sleeping on the couch. Well, I can't speak to that last part,  but assuming your babies' vitals are normal come morning, I'm ordering you on a full bed rest for the remainder of this pregnancy. Whatever it takes. Okay. Then I'll let you folks say your good nights,  and then you should go  and let this lady get some sleep. Thank you so much, Doctor. You're welcome. You want me to stay? No. We'll be okay. Okay. Thank you, Mama. I love you. I love you. You can go home, too. Charity, I'm not going anywhere, baby. I love you. Just be quiet. Please.
