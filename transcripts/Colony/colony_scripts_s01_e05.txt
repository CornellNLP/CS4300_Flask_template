 Previously, on Colony... 
 Do you have keys for that? 
 My dad was DWP. 
 He had keys for everything. 
 What's that noise? 
 It's the wall up above us. 
 Oh, my God. 
 We're outside the Colony, aren't we? 
 For that last three nights, I've been monitoring the skies, I saw something up there. 
 You have a telescope? 
 I got a small one. Been working on a bigger one. 
 Get on your knees. Do it now! 
 That guy we caught was doing pirate radio, yeah, but he's not Geronimo. 
 Hey, Will? Check it out. 
 Detainee said this is where he picked up the radio scripts. 
 You think all these cells are operating independently. 
 I do. 
 So who is Geronimo? 
 That's a very good question. 
 These are photos of people coming and going from the Green Zone. Point out Will's boss to me. 
 This is her. Her name is Phyllis.

 [sirens wailing] 
 Get down! Down! 
 Come on! 
 [overlapping yelling] 
 Get down! Down! 
 Hold him down! 
 Get his arm! Get his arm! 
 Drop it, now! 
 Stop moving! 
 Give me your hands! 
 Don't move! 
 [eerie music] 
 [birds chirping] 
 [groans] 
 Hey, baby. It's six in the morning. 
 What are you doing? 
 Couldn't sleep. 
 Remembered we had some extra paint out back, and... it matches close enough, right? 
 Yeah. 
 [knock at door] 
 [pound at door] 
 Will, I know you're in there. Open up. This better be good, like I won the lottery good. You did. Instant coffee that expired two years ago. Oh, good morning, Katie. Morning, Beau. Can we talk in private? Yeah. Uh... yeah. I'll go take a shower. What's up? Phyllis is dead. Homicide. What? Yeah. When did this happen? Last night. She was shot in her home up in the GZ. Close range. Her husband was murdered too. [overlapping chatter] [tense music] ♪ ♪ Her husband was a stroke victim. You all right? Yeah, I'm fine. I just--I-I can't believe that this happened. Where are the bodies? They took them to the morgue. Both Phyllis and her husband were shot at close range. Looks like a single assailant. Yeah, a good one. You guys are gonna want to see what's in the living room. Where does this evidence go? [indistinct police radio chatter] ♪ ♪ [sighs] Jesus. This is very bad. You understand that, right? Yes, of course we do. Phyllis had direct access to our Hosts. There's only a few people in that category. How does one of the most important people in the entire Transitional Authority get killed by Geronimo right here? Right under our noses? Because Geronimo's probably operating out of the GZ. You think Geronimo's up here? Luis Ortega, the announcer we caught, was picking up his radio broadcasts from a drainage pipe that runs from the flats right up to here. Phyllis new about this? She told me the GZ was fair game. Okay. But if you go sniffing around, you better be very discreet and very clear about what you're doing. Yeah, of course. Find Geronimo. [sighs] [radio beeps] Yeah, this is McMahon. Yeah, yeah, bring him to the post office. They just caught one of Geronimo's guys at the pipe. Snyder always this involved? No, never. He'd come around once in a while to see Phyllis. This Geronimo thing's put a bee up his bonnet. I got this. Hey, I'm Will Bowman. What's your name? Shawn Miller. But I didn't do anything. My dad's the head of Public Health and Hospitals. You should know that. That's awesome. I look forward to meeting him when you all get put on the bus to The Factory. Wait, no, you can't do that. You were transporting Resistance propaganda up in the Green Zone. The hell you thinking? How old are you, kid? 18. I got a son just about your age. So I'm gonna give you one chance to help yourself here. One chance. Who gave you the posters? [overlapping chatter] Keep walking. I'm just gonna walk with you. Thank you for meeting me. This isn't the best time for us to be seen together. You said it was urgent? Phyllis is dead. You already knew. Who killed her? We knew they had someone essential working for them. You helped us figure out who. You did good work. I thought we were just gathering intelligence. She was a threat. To all of us. Her job was to erase us. Our job... was to not let that happen. Good morning. [siren wails] [indistinct shouting] Come on. Move out! Move out! Get in position. We go on my mark. What's happening? Hey! Hey, hold on. You can't come up here. [intense music] ♪ ♪ Go! Go! Go! Right behind you! We're in! We're in! Unit two! Weapons hot! Fire in the hole! Go! Warm up on the door. Warm up! Moving in! Moving in! Okay, let's go! Let's move it! I'm in! I'm in! [indistinct chatter on police radio] Warm up on me! On the left! To the left! Clear! That side clear. All clear! Nobody's here. Mikey, sweep port! 10-3, around the back! Move it around back! C! Nothing here! Geronimo's living here? I don't think so. Yeah, no sh1t. Beau... ♪ ♪ Drop the weapon! [grunts] Fascists! I'm unarmed. [grunts] I'm unarmed! I'm-- Give me your arms! Give me your arms! Stay still! [grunting] On the ground! On the ground! [woman groaning] Stay still! Don't move! Two in custody. Over. Up! All right, get up! On your feet! On your feet! Get up! [whimpering] Who's Geronimo? We're-- we're Geronimo. Bram. I know. It's weird. Wow. I just found this place last week. It's some kind of food distribution center. How many times have you been outside the walls? 11, but who's counting? And you haven't seen anybody? Nope. Nobody. Only take stuff that's hard to get inside the bloc. You mean like coffee? Holy sh1t. You found coffee? Hazelnut Specialty Blend. [inhales deeply] I'm not much for flavored coffee, but man, that smell... [giggles] Good run for our first day. Yeah. This is a special announcement from the Transitional Authority. My fellow citizens, thanks to the diligent efforts of our Proxy, Alan Snyder, today is a historic day for the Los Angeles Colony. In a daring raid this morning by the brave men and women of our Homeland Security forces, Geronimo's headquarters in the La Brea district were breached. Many of his most trusted lieutenants were killed in a violent firefight, and some of our own brave soldiers gave their lives in the effort. But the operation ended in overwhelming victory. Remember where you are right now, my fellow citizens, because on this great day, the selfish forces of terror have been defeated. Those two didn't firebomb my house, and they definitely didn't kill Phyllis, so why the hell is Snyder announcing to the world that Geronimo's been captured? Because, like you said, he needs a victory. That's a big problem, 'cause the guys doing all the damage are still out there. Which means we're just getting started. Snyder is here. He's down in interrogation. He wants to see you. [sighs] Have fun. Yeah. [overlapping chatter] [buzzer sounds] That's Geronimo? Silver Lake and Echo Park? I just announced to the entire bloc that we caught a fearsome terrorist. You might've checked in first. Hello? How do I get her? He-- hello? Hello? Can you hear me? You know how to work that? Yeah, you bet. Yes, sir? Those two-- do they know anything about the attacks? Unlikely. Before we got one minute into the first cycle, he broke just from watching her. They didn't carry out any attacks? No, sir. They're not connected to any terrorist cells? No, sir. So, who are they? He's an ad executive and she's a graphic artist. Come on. We're going in there. [both whimper] You're Geronimo? Proxy-- Snyder. That's right. The two of you are Geronimo? Yes. Who were you working for? No one. We were working for every citizen of this bloc, Nazi collaborator asshole. You think it's a good idea for you to be saying things like that to me? You're gonna kill us anyway. Or ship us off to The Factory, which is just-- Why did you do it? We didn't have guns. We had something more powerful. We had words and images. We had the power to get inside people's heads. That's great, so you inspired real insurgents running around down the flats, killing innocent people in your name. That's real noble. Seriously, how are you doing what you're doing? You're not one of them. You are one of us. We're done. Let's go. 
 
 [door opens] 4-1-1-2, proceed to location. Can I talk to you a second? Take the next one. Sir. [indistinct conversation] What is it? We had a deal. I find Geronimo, you give me my son back. I held up my end of the bargain. Our deal we predicated on Geronimo being the leader of the Resistance, not some bullshit hipsters. You've put me in the unenviable position... I put you-- ...of having to step in and try and make some kind of victory out of this steaming sh1t pile. No, no-- you're not moving the goal posts back on me. Watch your tone, or you're gonna get a deal you really don't like. It's my son. Moving a person from bloc to bloc is a whole bureaucratic process, which I am working on. In the meantime, you need to be helping me. Now that Phyllis is dead, you're in charge of the unit. Apparently all the real terrorists are still out there, so find them. Hey, everybody listen up. I'm sure you've all heard that Geronimo has been captured. Yeah. Yes. Now, I know you're all concerned about what we do now. Their goal was to kill our hope. So, we'll use this tragedy as a source of strength. We'll show the Occupation that we are undiminished. In fact, stronger. Yeah! Prepare yourselves. The war is about to begin. Yeah! [knock at door] You wanted to see me? Close the door. Sit down. Okay, here I am, sitting. I think you're the reason Phyllis is dead. How's that? Somebody's always one step ahead of us. There's only one way that can happen-- if we've got a leak. You think I'm the leak. I'm pretty sure it ain't Beau, and I'm sure as hell it ain't me. Are you? You're sure as hell? Because Phyllis had her own theory. Which was what? Why do you think Phyllis had your wife come into her office alone? Why would she do that? What if you were passing information to the Resistance without even knowing it? Being the trusting husband that you are. I mean, if it were true, you'd be a fantastic source of information, wouldn't you? Maybe you should think about that before you start accusing me. [talking in next room] Hey, guys. Dad! Hi. [both laugh] How you doing there, little bear? Good. Just doing some math. Math? That's great. Katie home? She went to the Yonk for a delivery, she said, Mr. Bowman. Can I talk to you for a second, Lindsey? Sure. The day of the firebombing, did you see anything unusual? Anything at all? No, nothing. I already told the investigators. Mrs. Bowman asked me to take the kids to the park, and I missed the whole thing. Is that a normal thing? For her to ask you to take the kids to the park? Oh, sure. Not usually so early, but yes. Okay, thanks. Mm-hmm. Not keeping you busy at work? [sighs] I'd rather be working here. What's the matter, baby? Phyllis is dead. What? How did that happen? Someone shot her, and her husband, up in the Green Zone. Jesus. Did you say anything about Phyllis to anybody? No, of course not. I was thinking maybe you could tell me a little bit more about that conversation between the two of you. Maybe she said something to you that might help. [sighs] Um... She wanted to know about our marriage. Our life together. I think she was suspicious of me. Suspicious? How? I think she was trying to figure out if the bombing was related to you and me, or our relationship. How would it be? I don't know. She wasn't giving up any theories. Just wondering why she would think that, and how it would be connected. You tell me. But, it's why I was so upset when I left her office. Anything else you might remember that could help? Nothing I can think of. All right. I gotta go back to work. Bye. You know, drinking on the job is gonna get you fired. I hope so. Hello, Alan. Hello, Helena. I've got some great news. Uh, well, I'm sure you know it by now. We caught Geronimo. Yes, I briefed the Governor-General and we all heard your radio address. I wanted the flatlanders to know. Your bloc, your call. I'm-- I'm curious. Uh, Geronimo's capture. Did you let our Hosts know? Do they know that we have issues with the Resistance? Of course they do. Have we told them anything specific about Geronimo? No. The Governor-General wants to wait and see where this is all going first. So, my question to you, Alan, is-- will Geronimo roll over on the other terrorists or not? Uh, actually, as it turns out, Geronimo was more of a figurehead than an actual terrorist. He wasn't running the Resistance? No, he's a propagandist who was using artwork to unite people behind the Resistance. That's unfortunate, Alan. Yes, and no. Some people might say that words and images are the most powerful weapons we have. So, I have a plan to take his power and use it for us. And how are you going to do that? Just trust me. I'm gonna turn this into a win for us. Okay. I'll take your word for it. If you want me to go into the details, I can-- No, no, no. You don't need my sign off. You're the captain of your own ship, Alan. If you need our help, let us know. Thanks for stopping by. Hey, Gracie. I got something for you. What is it? Markers? Where did you get these? From a friend. So now you can make some more blue tigers. [laughs] Thanks, Bram. Sure. Hey. Daddy, look what Bram got me. Wow, sweetie. Markers? Where'd you get those? I traded a friend at school some oranges. [buzzer sounds] All right. Luis Ortega. Character actor extraordinaire. Pool Cue Biker in one movie. Uh... Freddie, no last name, in another. Salesman, Thug Number Three, Grill Chef-- 23 credits total, all small stuff. How'd you like a starring role? Doing what? Playing another one-name part you've already nailed. Geronimo. I don't know what you're talking about. Do you remember the first few days after the Arrival? Do I remember? I lost half my family. So did a lot of people, until I ended that. I brought order and stability to this bloc. But now, because of this Geronimo bullshit, I need to prove to my bosses that my bloc is still under control, and if I don't, it's gonna mean more misery for all of us. So, maybe we can help each other. How? You don't want to go to The Factory, do you? Right. Exactly. So, here's what I'm proposing. I need a patsy. Someone to take the fall in public. I need some theatrics. That's your specialty. You play Geronimo for me for a few days... and in turn, I'll spare your life and get you relocated to another colony. Okay. Thank you, Luis. You're gonna be a big help. And, you might even have fun in the process. [muffled argument] [knocks on door] Bram. Hey, Mr. Carson. It's an hour until curfew. You shouldn't be here. I know. It's just that I heard about Geronimo and I want to help you with your telescope. Shh! Get it. Get in. This is amazing. Does it work? No. Not unless I can find a high-quality lens or learn how to make one. I think I can get one for you. You can get a telescope lens? Yeah. Do I even want to ask? No, you do not. Hmm. I'll tell you what. You find me that lens, and you and I are gonna figure out what those RAPs are doing up there. Hmm? [eerie music] ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ [sighs] You wanted to see me? You know how that thing works? It's a computer. It's software with a keyboard terminal. I think I could figure it out. Good, 'cause we're gonna need it to run down this cell. We? Does that mean you no longer think I'm Mata Hari? Want a drink? She's got booze stashed in there. Yeah. Yeah, I'll have some. Thank you. To Phyllis. Yeah. [coughs] Not a whiskey girl? No, no I'm not. Whiskey makes me drunk and, uh, yeah, two actual drinks and I'm-- Fun? [laughs] Is that why you don't trust me? Because I'm not fun? No, I didn't trust you because the list of people I trust fits on one hand. Yeah, I get that. [sighs] Our world now, it's all secrets and lies. Phyllis never even told me she had a husband. I want to apologize. Sorry for going after you like that. It's all right. I'm curious-- why did Phyllis think Katie was working for the Resistance? I don't know. I mean, don't take it personally. Phyllis was good at her job because she was suspicious of everybody. What do you think? I don't think that there is a leak. Not in our unit. I think they're getting their information from somewhere else. You know, I don't know anything about you. Are you married? Nope. This is it. I-- I was supposed to get married. The weekend after the Arrival, but it didn't work out. What happened? [sighs] Um... Do you remember the first big terrorist bombing in Westwood? My fiancé-- uh, Jason, he was walking past there when it went off. He was on his way to work at UCLA hospital. He's a-- he-- He  was  an ER doc. You know, your life can... completely change in an instant. It's... I never-- I never really understood that before. No one deserves to go through what I've gone through. No, they don't. This is Hank Dawkins, once again reporting from the trial of Luis Ortega, better known as Geronimo. This morning was filled with more devastating testimony from the victims of this cold-blooded terrorist. We now go live inside the courtroom. As always, viewer discretion is advised. Let's continue. Next witness, come forward. [sniffles] My son Wesley served with Homeland Security for the last two months. We were all so proud of him when he took the job. He'd struggled his whole life, and we thought,  "Finally, he got it." Wesley was working security at the Santa Monica Gateway when Geronimo's bomb exploded. [cries] [mechanical whirring] Welcome to day six of the Geronimo trial, where the dramatic testimony has captivated the city. This morning, we will be hearing from one of our youngest colonists. My dad just wanted to get food for us. What happened next? He ran at the truck, and... Geronimo's soldiers shot him. Why do you think Geronimo did that? Because he didn't want him to get any food. It won't be long now before we have a verdict, and I've been hearing the same thing from citizens young and old, black and white-- they're demanding justice. After the Arrival, the Transitional Authority worked very closely with our new allies to bring about the law and order that this colony so loudly demanded. Since then, unprecedented peace and public safety have been realized in Los Angeles. But, these rights should not be assumed to be constants. The freedoms you enjoy are not a given. They are provided at the pleasure of our Hosts. This colony's security is predicated on its citizens' willingness to be active participants in its governance. Anyone-- everyone hearing these words can help to root out the terrorists who would seek to upset the order and balance we now enjoy. After considering all the facts of this case, this tribunal finds the accused... guilty. [crowd murmuring] It is the ruling of this court that the accused is hereby sentenced to death. [crowd murmuring] Sentence to be carried out immediately. [gavel bangs] Well done. We made a deal. We made a deal! We made a deal! [grunts, moans] [gags] We made a deal! Hold him. Hold him. You lied! We made a deal! We made a deal! [intense music] ♪ ♪ Will. Ride with me. I just came to update you on the case. I've got other work to do. You can update me later. There's someone I want you to meet. [dramatic music] ♪ ♪ All set? Yes, sir. We're on the clock. Come on. Get in the car. Redbird One, good to go. Lead One. Roger that. Rolling out. [engines revving] ♪ ♪ [sirens wailing]
