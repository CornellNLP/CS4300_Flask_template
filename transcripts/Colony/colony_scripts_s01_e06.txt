 Previously on "Colony"... 
 Get on your knees! Do it now! 
 As it turns out, Geronimo was more of a figurehead than an actual terrorist. 
 That's unfortunate, Alan. 
 Trust me, I'm gonna turn this into a win for us. 
 I need a patsy... someone to take the fall in public. 
 You play Geronimo, I'll spare your life and get you relocated to another colony. 
 We made a deal! We made a deal! 
 Phyllis is dead. 
 Someone shot her and her husband up in the Green Zone. 
 Did you say anything about Phyllis to anybody? 
 No, of course not. 
 Will, ride with me. 
 There's someone I want you to meet. 
 Come on, get in the car. 
 All set? We're on the clock. 
 Redbird One, good to go. 
 Roger that. 
 Rolling out. 
 [sirens wailing] 
 Today Los Angeles knows peace once again. 
 The tribunal has ruled. 
 The sentence has been handed down. 
 And now, finally, after Geronimo's long reign of terror, justice is to be carried out. 
 [phone ringing] 
 Yes? 
 [sighs] Of course I've been watching. 
 His decision. 
 But as it is his bloc, we thought it was important to give him some latitude. 
 At least the counterinsurgency he put together has been effective, especially considering the loss of the task force head. 
 Yes, I know. I spoke with New York. 
 They're put out, but they're looking for another solution. 
 Well, they selected him for a reason, so... 
 I think we just let it play out. 
 He either gets things under control, or he gives us the justification that we need to make a change. 
 No, I know. We need to be ready. 
 No, I won't let it come to that. 
 [seagulls crying] 
 [dramatic music] 
 [sirens wailing] 
 What's the problem? 
 What was the gain in doing that? 
 The people demanded justice for what Geronimo did, and we granted it. 
 That guy wasn't even Geronimo. 
 It's called catharsis. 
 The public gets appeased, and we remind them that law and order will endure in this bloc. 
 'Cause you strung up a radio announcer. 
 Outside of our inner circle, no one know the particulars of his involvement with the Resistance. 
 Except his family. 
 The fact is that Luis supported a violent terrorist movement, which is no better than being a terrorist himself. 
 Trust me when I tell you that what I did gave him the most merciful end he was gonna get. 
 What you did is just gonna piss people off. 
 Let them be angry. 
 They're alive, and they're still relatively free. 
 You think I martyred him, but I believe self-interest rules the day. 
 And when people see the consequences of participating in the Resistance, they're gonna think twice before getting involved themselves. 
 I hope you're right. 
 In the meantime, what I have done has bought you the time to find the real terrorists... something I would greatly appreciate.

 Get us out of here. 
 Go! 
 Start driving, or we're all dead! 
 No, he's out! 
 [engine revving] 
 We need to get out of here. 
 Stay in the car. 
 [indistinct shouting] 
 Move 'em out! 
 Move, move! 
 Eyes up! 
 [indistinct shouting] 
 Wait. That guy's Homeland. 
 They're not with us. 
 [paintball guns firing] 
 What the hell are they doing? 
 Blinding us. 
 60 seconds! 
 Move! 
 [tool grinding] 
 What's that? 
 Get in the front. 
 What? Why? 
 Get in the front! 
 Switch with Snyder! Get in the back! 
 [indistinct shouting] 
 Go, go! 
 Hook in! Back up! Back up! 
 Maintain fire control, damn it! 
 [indistinct shouting] 
 Keep your head down! 
 Move! 
 90 seconds. That's 90 seconds. 
 Drones are gonna be coming! 
 Pull out! 
 98 seconds! 
 Pull out! 
 Get to the car! 
 Drones coming in! 
 [drones whirring] 
 We're too exposed. We need to get out of the open. 
 Yeah, no sh1t. 
 We shouldn't have ditched the car. 
 We shouldn't be on foot! 
 Were you in the military, law enforcement? 
 No. 
 Right. 
 Still, I don't think this is a good idea. 
 Listen to me. Those people were coming after you. 
 And if they find you, they're gonna torture you, and then they're gonna kill you. 
 You want to stay alive? 
 Then today I don't work for you. You work for me, got it? 
 Okay. 
 Thank you... for saving me. Thank you. 
 Just keep moving. 
 Okay. 
 Where are we going? 
 Someplace safe. 
 sh1t. 
 [sighs] 
 Come on. Come on. 
 Come on. 
 Come on. Come on. 
 [door rattling loudly] 
 Who is it? 
 Katie? 
 Katie, open the door! 
 What... happened? 
 We got ambushed. 
 Is the rest of the bar locked? 
 Yeah. 
 Ambushed? 
 It was an abduction attempt, I think. 
 It's a coup. I knew this was going to happen. 
 It's a viper's nest up there. You haven no idea. 
 We don't know it's a coup. 
 Then how do you explain all my former Red-hatted friends trying to kill me? 
 Could be Resistance. 
 You think the Resistance got inside Homeland Security? 
 I think that food-truck raid was a dress rehearsal for this. 
 I didn't want to bring him here. It's the only place close by. 
 I had to get him off the street. 
 Did anyone follow you? 
 I hope not. 
 Can you call the drones or something? 
 Even kings have limits to their power, Will. 
 We're gonna have to hole up here till help arrives. 
 No. No more Redhats. We can't trust them. 
 I've got to call the Task Force. 
 We can't trust them either. Nothing goes over the air. 
 Well, we can't hide in here forever. 
 I promise you, as we speak, everyone loyal to me is hitting the streets. 
 We just have to wait it out. 
 Well, I hope your cavalry moves fast, 'cause whoever organized this operation put a lot of time and resources into it. 
 And they're gonna be looking door-to-door for the prize they missed. 
 Could be only a matter of time before the bread crumbs lead them here. 
 Mm-hmm. 
 I'm gonna call Beau. 
 "Magnum P.I."? 
 Beau's good. 
 No, Lagarza. I want Lagarza. 
 Will, we need to call someone, and there's a phone in my office. 
 Stay away from the windows. 
 Are you crazy? 
 You're risking your life for that man? 
 Should I have left him there in the street to die? 
 The last thing I wanted to do is get you caught up in this. 
 What are you doing here so early? 
 I came in to do inventory. 
 That's dead. 
 The Authority never switched it back on. 
 Did you talk to Lagarza? 
 Phone's dead. 
 No, landlines are all supposed to work. 
 Well, they don't. 
 Where are you going? 
 To find a pay phone. 
 Will... 
 [groans] 
 Jesus. Will, you're bleeding. 
 I got tagged by a bullet fragment. 
 You need a doctor. 
 It can wait. 
 No, no, no, let me go for help. 
 I can go out the back. 
 You can't leave. 
 I can't? 
 Look, we don't know what's out there. 
 I'm not gonna bleed to death. 
 When I get back, I'll teach you how to be field medic. 
 I'm fine. It's blood, not guts. 
 But you just said yourself that we don't know what's out there. 
 I've got to call in the cavalry. 
 Okay, there's a pay phone three blocks, four blocks east of here. 
 Here. 
 You... you can't just leave me. 
 You want to go home? 
 I'll be right back. 
 [grunts in pain] 
 We should probably wait in my office in case somebody comes looking for you. 
 I know you don't like me. 
 But this isn't my fault. 
 We're all misunderstood. 
 [indistinct chatter in the distance] 
 Thanks. 
 Heller? 
 It was a bad day. 
 Yeah. 
 You okay? 
 Got through clean. 
 You know, it's okay to feel something. 
 [door opens] 
 [door closes] 
 Hey. What the hell happened? 
 Will was with him in the car. 
 Pulled some cowboy sh1t and got Snyder out before the drones arrived. 
 Will managed all that alone? 
 He just needed to buy himself 98 seconds. 
 I searched the area on foot, but he got away in the target vehicle. 
 I'm sure they ditched it. They could be anywhere by now. 
 We had him. 
 We need to reconsider our options. 
 We cannot walk away from this. 
 Broussard. 
 Not now! 
 It's important, sir. 
 What is it, Vasquez? 
 It's Katie. She's asking for you. 
 Hey. You all right? 
 I know where Snyder is. 
 Where? 
 This doesn't change our agreement. 
 Will is off-limits. 
 I need to hear you say it. 
 Will is off-limits. 
 I have Snyder alone at the Yonk. 
 Will just went to call for help. There is no time. Come quickly. 
 [toy rattling] 
 You grew up in the South? 
 I grew up all over. 
 I spent a lot of time there, though. 
 Navy brat. 
 Must have made your father happy... your marrying into the military. 
 You should ask my Navy captain father how he felt about me marrying an enlisted Army grunt. 
 Where does your family live now? 
 New Orleans... 
 If it's still around. 
 I honestly have no idea. 
 Okay. 
 And how did you get involved in all this? 
 I mean, putting aside the conspiracy theories that this was planned for decades and our government was somehow complicit... 
 Somebody must have approached you, right? 
 Or recruited you before handing you a crown. 
 I was the provost at Stanford... greatest university in the world. 
 They needed someone that could get their arms around a new form of government, bring about order and control quickly, peacefully. 
 They came to you before the Arrival? 
 After. 
 Well, what about all the other public officials who actually had experience with that kind of thing. 
 Are they all dead? 
 I don't know. 
 But my PhD in economics and my experience in running a $5.1 billion operating budget meant that I was nicely suited for their administrative needs. 
 So you're from up north? 
 No, I'm from Long Island... go, Jets... but I lived in Palo Alto. 
 So how did you get to LA? 
 They relocated me. 
 So we're not the only colony. 
 There are others. 
 How many? 
 The Pacific Coast region... 
 California, Oregon, and Washington... has seven colonies. 
 But beyond that, I meant it when I said I have no idea. 
 What about all the land between the colonies? 
 What's out there? 
 That's somewhere you do not want to be. 
 Why? What's the... 
 [door opens, creaks] 
 [door closes] 
 
 
 
 Hey. 
 You got back fast. 
 I cut through the alleyway. 
 I remembered there was a pay phone on Fairbanks. 
 Did you get a hold of Lagarza? 
 He's 25 minutes out. 
 Well, make that 21 now. 
 20? He knows he doesn't have to stop at the lights, right? 
 Will, 20 minutes... we can't stay here. 
 What if they're out searching door-to-door? 
 We'll be fine. 
 You ready to patch me up? 
 Yes. 
 [grunts] 
 That's not the good stuff, is it? 
 It's only the best for you, baby. 
 [chuckles] 
 Okay, clean off most of the blood. 
 [grunts] Okay. 
 Now get a clean towel. 
 Cut a strip about six inches wide. 
 Do you think this attack was retribution from Geronimo's followers? 
 I doubt it. 
 Why? 
 Geronimo's not the folk hero everyone thinks he is. 
 How so? 
 Okay, wrap that tight. 
 Tight. 
 [groans, sighs] 
 That's good. 
 I think you just earned a merit badge. 
 [chuckles] 
 Will, this is our chance. 
 We should give Snyder up to whoever's looking for him. 
 And then what? 
 Snyder is an asshole who deserves what's coming to him. 
 All we have to do is step out of the way. 
 And then another bureaucrat with a new agenda replaces him. 
 Snyder is the devil we know. 
 How's the arm? 
 I'll live. 
 I know that this isn't an ideal situation... for a lot of reasons. 
 But I'm a good friend to have. 
 Yeah, I know. 
 I was gonna tell you this at our meeting today. 
 I'm very happy to relay that my contacts in Santa Monica have just confirmed your son, Charlie, is alive. 
 How do you know that? 
 Because I keep my promises. 
 If you are lying about this... 
 Are they bringing him back? 
 I know you don't understand or necessarily care about inter-colony politics, but it's very complicated. 
 There's a ton of red tape and bureaucracy. 
 All right, look... [clears throat] 
 I don't have the power to navigate this on my own. 
 Of course you don't. 
 But I'm working on it. 
 Understand that I am really exposing myself here for you guys. 
 This is not something I would do for anyone else. 
 What are you doing? 
 Negotiating... with the Chief of Staff to the Governor General of the entire Los Angeles colony. 
 I was going to introduce you to her before we got... waylaid. 
 What's her name? 
 Helena Goldwyn. 
 She has the power to make this whole Charlie thing happen. 
 How do we know you're not just saying this to get what you want? 
 Come on, Katie, give me a little credit. 
 This is family. 
 Mm-hmm. 
 I wouldn't lie about something like that. 
 I promise you, I'm on your side, and I want to see this happen just as much... 
 All right, okay, that's probably impossible, but I really want to help you get him back. 
 I just need to make it out of this little predicament if I'm going to keep that ball rolling. 
 [pounding on door] 
 In the bathroom. 
 [pounding on door] 
 I'm sorry, Officer. 
 We've had some attempts on our liquor supply. 
 I'm just being careful. 
 Ma'am, if you have any safety issues, you need to report them to Homeland Security immediately. 
 We'll handle them. 
 Of course. What can I do for you? 
 I need you to let me inside. 
 Do you mind telling me why? 
 We're looking for a missing person. 
 Who? 
 Can't say. 
 Please, ma'am. 
 I don't want to have to force my way in. 
 It's just me here. I'm... just prepping for tonight. 
 Still need to clear the building. 
 Well, obviously, this is the main room. 
 Need to see them all, ma'am. 
 Of course. 
 Uh, my office, down here... the patio, the bathrooms, and the kitchen. 
 [door creaks, closes] 
 That's about it. 
 I'm sorry I couldn't be more helpful. 
 [knocking on wall] 
 What's this? 
 That's just the basement... storage. 
 Need to look there too, ma'am. 
 Okay. 
 Lead the way. 
 [door creaks, closes] 
 Snyder's in the men's room. 
 I know. 
 Will called Special Ops. 
 The Red Berets are on their way for Snyder. 
 We need to get to him first, then. 
 Will's right upstairs. 
 Quayle sees Snyder as the priority. 
 If you can't get him out, Quayle's gonna come in. 
 You gave me your word. 
 All Quayle wants is Snyder. 
 Get him out the back door, and this all ends. 
 Sorry for the disturbance, ma'am. 
 Thank you for your cooperation. 
 Don't mention it. 
 Best to lock the doors after I leave. 
 If you have any more trouble, pick up the phone and dial 0 to reach Homeland Security, ma'am. 
 Will do. Thank you. 
 Take care, ma'am. 
 [exhales deeply] 
 You did great. 
 I don't know. 
 Proxy Snyder is missing, and that guy's out searching alone? 
 Redhats don't do anything alone. 
 What do you think? 
 I think that guy was Resistance. 
 Do you think we fooled him? 
 If he saw that, then they're coming back. 
 [sighs] 
 Can you help me with this one? 
 Yeah. 
 Okay, uh, now what? 
 You make some homemade bombs or some booby traps or something, right? 
 Nope. 
 Th... this is it? This is the plan? 
 [sighs] We got about seven minutes till Lagarza's ETA. 
 If they come in, we just got to slow them down. 
 Slow them down? How? 
 I'm gonna hole up here... shoot whoever comes through those doors. 
 I'm having a drink. Anyone else? 
 You still believe anything that man says? 
 I have to believe him... because I don't know what else there is. 
 Even if it risks your life? Our lives? 
 Everything we have is tied to him. 
 I'd like to remind everyone who might be paying attention that I rescued your husband and all the rest of you from a life of misery and imprisonment. 
 If you want me to continue to be helpful in retrieving your son... 
 You son of a bitch! 
 Hey! Hey, hey! 
 I'm so sick... of your threats to my family! 
 Hey, get her off me! 
 Hey... aah! 
 Jesus! 
 Hold it. 
 What the hell are you doing? 
 Let's see how long he survives without us! 
 I realize that we are all in an unusually stressful situation... that does not bring out the best in us, so I'm willing to forget this. 
 That's because I'm a reasonable man. 
 And if you think otherwise, then you really don't want to meet the people who spend their days plotting to take my seat. 
 I'm sorry to be the bearer of unpleasant truths, Katie... but I'm the best there is. 
 And I really am trying to help you. 
 [beep] 
 Situation report. 
 [beep] 
 We're close. She has him. 
 What are you waiting for? 
 Well, we made a deal with her. 
 And you confirmed it. 
 Will put himself in the line of fire the day he put on red. 
 He's a soldier. He accepted that. 
 Katie hasn't. 
 Do I need to remind you of the chain of command? 
 Bring Snyder out. 
 No Homeland patrols. Drones, either. 
 You sure they care you're missing? 
 They're coming for me, Will. 
 Homeland Security is just... trained to be discreet. 
 [scoffs] 
 Well... there's one. 
 One what? 
 Redhat. 
 Good Redhat or bad Redhat? 
 I don't know. 
 This should be impossible. 
 All of them were screened for this. 
 What do you mean, screened? 
 Every person in the colony was filtered through this algorithm. 
 It's how they knew who to select and what to do with them. 
 They used the data from the Rolodex? 
 Our hosts know everything about us. 
 Well, knew everything. 
 They had our entire data record when they arrived. 
 We gave them the keys to the kingdom. 
 That how they found you? 
 When they approached me, they told me I was the perfect candidate. 
 You've met them? 
 What are they like? 
 It's a humbling moment, realizing... just how insignificant we all are in the universe. 
 [thudding, footsteps] 
 They're upstairs? 
 They're setting spotters. 
 Or maybe snipers to shoot us if we run out. 
 Katie, they're coming! 
 You, office. 
 You, basement. 
 I'm not leaving you up here alone. 
 This is what I do, Katie. 
 Let me help you. 
 Not here, not this. You need to go downstairs. 
 For the kids. 
 You're going home tonight. 
 Will... 
 Go. Now.

 [gunshots] 
 Ugh. 
 Drop the weapon. 
 Not another step. 
 Drop your gun. 
 Katie. 
 25 feet, high stress... 
 Doubt you'll make that shot clean. 
 I know I will. 
 Katie, put the gun down. 
 It's okay. 
 Where's Snyder? 
 Office. 
 Move. 
 No, Will... Will! 
 [sirens pulsing] 
 Go! Move, move! 
 Go, go, go! 
 Freeze! 
 Drop the weapon! 
 Easy, easy. Homeland Security. 
 Have you seen a Redhat? 
 A guy, he... he's dressed like you. 
 He came through here. 
 No, sir. 
 Move it! Let's go! 
 Come on, men, on me, on me! 
 [drones roaring] 
 Damn it! 
 Cover that. 
 Cover that! 
 [men shouting distantly] 
 He's gone. 
 [radio chatter] 
 Where is he? 
 He escaped. 
 Behind the bar. 
 [background chatter, radio chatter] 
 Back all clear. 
 Sir. 
 Whoever that guy was, I want him found... and I want him to die. 
 Badly. 
 Everything we have, Will. 
 Throw it at him. 
 [background chatter continues] 
 [radio chatter continues] 
 I know it's really bad right now. 
 But you have to keep telling yourself that you did what you had to do. 
 That he put you in that position. 
 Do you think Geronimo's followers will come after us for today? 
 I know they won't. 
 How? 
 Because Geronimo's not a terrorist. 
 He's some ad-guy up in the Green Zone. 
 Snyder's trial was a farce. 
 The only thing Geronimo ever led was a really smart street-art campaign. 
 Some people down here rallied around the message, used it for violence. 
 But the folk hero in the headdress... he doesn't exist. 
 The people who pulled this thing off today... now, they're something else. 
 Homeland's across the street. 
 They'll be watching everything that goes on here now. 
 I'm fine, Will. Go. 
 Hey. 
 You're my hero. 
 I love you. 
 I love you. 
 So where are we? 
 In the wind. Garage is closed. 
 I sent everyone left into hiding. 
 Well... at least we know. 
 Know? 
 The armory, Kim's house, today. 
 It all tracks now. 
 Katie fed us bullshit. 
 And then she helped her husband take us apart. 
 Look at me and tell me you don't see it. 
 She's a double agent.
