 Previously on "Colony"... 
 You have been assigned What is this? Who ordered you to search my house? I've been sent here because this office has failed to live up to the standards of the Authority. You will get the chance to prove yourself. You need to work for me. What? I know what you've been doing, and I have the evidence. Hey, don't forget to pick up Charlie today. See you tonight. Copy that. I couldn't get Charlie. I'll go get him. [blasting] Government found him in the Santa Monica bloc. I want to see Solomon. Your son would've starved on the streets if it wasn't for me. Charlie! [grunts] Okay! [grunting] [dramatic music] ♪ [indistinct chatter] Next up! Have your identification ready! Are you signing up for the Redhats? If they'll take me. You got any military training or weapons skills? I used to take cardio kickboxing. Does that count? [laughs] Well, I hear they're desperate for more men. They'll... they'll probably take anyone they can get. Hope you're right. I could use the extra rations. Next ten inside. All right, come on, let's move. Good luck. Thanks. Come on, let's go. Move it. Stop there. [explosion] [grunting] [screaming] [dramatic music] ♪ [gunshots] [screaming] [gunfire continues] [screaming and gunfire continue] [muffled gunfire] [muffled scream] ♪ You collaborate, you die. ♪ [dramatic music] ♪ [indistinct chatter] This doesn't... this doesn't look good. gonna hang this on you. higher-ups, it's gotta happen now. Morning. Your office said you needed to see me. Who are those guys? Professionals. This shitshow that I inherited makes more sense now that I know the previous regime was recruiting from dating websites. I was in database administration. My skill set includes... A career in high-level counterintelligence? Former CIA, Operations Division. Interpol. MI-6. They've been sent from outside the bloc to clean up our mess, which is not just embarrassing... It might have serious consequences. We need to find Broussard and recover our Host's artifact. And nothing in your resume or work so far makes me believe that you will be useful in this endeavor. Sir, I've been working in this bloc for six months. I... I know the history of the insurgency, how it's structured. And I have numerous contacts. Don't tell me you're valuable. Show me. Okay. Let's go through the ten qualities. Okay? Mm-hmm. Number one. Obedience. Very good. [phone rings] Number two? Hard work. [phone ringing] Hello? Do you want to go shopping? Sorry. Who is this? I can barely hear you. I'm the person who knows all about your old friendships. There's a swap meet at MacArthur Park. For the sake of your family, meet me there in half an hour. Reverence. Good job. Enlightenment. I have to go handle something at the Yonk. Can you... can you watch Gracie? Of course, Mrs. Bowman. May I have a word with you first? Yes. What is it? [clears throat] Um... I don't understand why Gracie can't continue her studies with Hudson up in the Green Zone. The change of scenery's been very distracting. I'm fighting with my sister. Oh. Have you tried listening to Sister Maddie's perspective? She's been received into the Greatest Day. That is a huge honor. I will keep that in mind. I love you. I'll see you soon. Love you. Bye. Okay. Where were we? Let's see. Oh, yes. Um, you hungry? That's a good idea. Save it for later. You want to see something cool? I got this on duty three years ago. Through... and through. You got shot? Every scar's a story. The more you live, the more you get. Nothing to be embarrassed about. A guy hit me with a board. It had a nail in it. Maybe we tell your dad you got that one... walking into a wall or something. [tense music] ♪ Hey! Hey! [grunting] Hold him down. Come on. Grab his boots. [shouting] Hurry. Welcome to the sh1t, fish. [coughs] [gasps] ♪ You two, over there! This way. Take your stations. Let's go. ♪ What happened to your boots, kid? [laughs] [indistinct radio chatter] Find anything you like? What do you want from me? You know what I want. I already told you that I can't give you Broussard. I don't have any way to contact him. I don't believe that. I have a new boss. He's gonna turn over every stone in this bloc. The only way to stop him is to give him what he wants. I don't want to hand you over, but if you won't help me, I don't have a choice. There's a bug in Homeland. What? A tiny drone that looks like a bee. That's how they got all their intelligence for their operations. A bee? That's all I can give you. Please do not contact me again. [knocks at door] Oh, come in. You okay? Yeah. I'm all right. But when these things begin to take place, straighten up and lift up your heads, for your redemption is drawing near. Luke 21:28. So, how does this verse compare to the one from the Koran? Or from the early scriptures of Hinduism? Well, it's the same basic story. We, mankind, will face a great trial. Yes. Exactly. Yet all of these religions also promise that we will emerge from the other side even stronger than we were before. Take, for example, the Buddhist concept of Nirvana. Is everything all right, Katie? Well, the last year's been hard. [laughs] No sh1t. [both laugh] None of us had planned for this, huh? Man plans. The gods laugh. [sighs] You know, I'm... Everyone responded to this in their own way, right? I had to act. And I think I put my ideals ahead of my family. Admitting our sins is always difficult. But taking responsibility for them is a different matter. I'll take responsibility for everything I've done. I don't want it to land on my daughter. [sniffles] We're alone. You have family in the bloc, don't you? A sister? Ah... That hasn't been easy either. Mm. It's been my experience that blood will always rise to the occasion if you give it the chance. You just have to ask yourself what matters most to you: your problems or your pride? [sighs, laughs] [indistinct radio chatter] This is what you couldn't wait to show me? It'll be the perfect space. It's much more welcoming than a church. Sure, it needs a little TLC, but imagine purple banners, artwork on the walls, modern furniture, warmer lighting scheme. Okay. You've really committed to this, haven't you? The more worship facilities we build, the stronger our influence will grow. I love it. Yeah? I love it! And it's only the beginning of what we're gonna accomplish together. What the hell happened to you? I'm fine. You n't look fine. I know who jumped you, took your boots. [dark music] ♪ Who? ♪ You can't let him get away with stealing your sh1t. This place will eat you alive. ♪ Hey. How are you two getting along? Thick as thieves. Did you find what you were looking for? Yeah. What happened? ♪ Solomon won't be bothering you or any of your friends again. What the hell were you thinking? Solomon has business partners. As soon as they realize what's happened, they're gonna tear apart this bloc looking for us. We'd better go, then. Yeah. And I'm coming with you. To L.A.? I'm not gonna stick around here and pay your bills. You owe me, Bowman. All right. All right. Now we just need to find a way out of here. Any chance the three of us can pile in your car and drive through the L.A. gateway without a transit pass? No. Come on. You got to know another way out of this bloc. We could use a coyote. You know one? One. But you're not gonna like it. [knocking at door] Hey. Thanks for coming. You said it was important. Can we... Come sit, please. I want to apologize for going behind your back to Nolan. I'm in trouble, Mad. I need your help again. [sighs] What's going on? Things are getting pretty bad down here in the flats, and a woman from Homeland has been asking questions. What kind of questions? Will's on the other side of the Wall, and Bram's in prison. And they think they smell something. And I think they're gonna come for me. That's ridiculous. Look, I'll talk to Nolan. No, no, no, no. Don't. Don't. You found a safe harbor. I don't want to do anything to mess that up for you. I just need to know that if there's a knock on my door, you will look after Gracie. Of course I will, Katie. But nothing's gonna happen to you. Thanks. Oh, of course. [knocking] I'm friends with Chuck. Open up. We need three tickets out of the bloc. Well, what have you got to trade? [scoffs] It's not enough. I got a place. Generator, boarded windows, escape tunnel, enough food to last a year, easy. I'm talking about a small fortune here. Sounds like paradise. So, why are you leaving? Tired of beach living. I want to know how this works. Well, you go over the Wall. There's a low point where the Wall cuts through the mountains. It's only about 150 feet high there. How do you do it? Well, my drone here takes a line up, rigs it around the top. You climb up one side, repel down the other. Are you serious? I didn't say it was gonna be easy. Kids have done it before. Older than him, though. What about their drones? Well, the top of the Wall's a dead spot. They launch from up there, but their sensors aren't activated immediately. You might see them, but they won't see you. All right. You heard the plan. Are you okay with it? It's just a wall. [laughs, claps hands] That's what I'm talking about. All right. Then we're going home. 
 
 [cabinet drawers slamming] [sighs] Explain to me once again why we are wasting valuable time searching our own office. My source said we were bugged. By a bumblebee. He's very reliable. Hm. Ma'am. Is this what you meant? My office. Now. Give me your source. I don't think that's a good idea. He's skittish. He knows we were bugged, and he thinks we have leaks, so he only wants to deal with me. I don't have the time to figure out if you actually know how to run an asset or if this was a lucky accident. Or maybe you gave me this because it didn't cost you anything. So, bring me something actionable on Broussard immediately, or I'm taking over the operation. Understand? Yes, sir. ♪ Hey. You took my... [all shouting at once] Get him! Get him! [overlapping shouts and cheers] [Taser clicking] [Lawson groaning] Jesus, Jenkins. Are you running a labor camp or "The Octagon"? Security is my responsibility, and I was handling the situation. Yeah. You clearly had it under control. One of the reasons they sent me here was to lower the prisoner attrition rate. If it doesn't fall, maybe I'll explain your methods to them. ♪ What is that? This is a Bible. And this is a Koran. And this is the works of Confucius. And one of the volumes of the Buddhist Tipitaka. [laughs] It's a funny word. Now, I know that Lindsey has taught you that what other people believe is bad. But there is absolutely nothing bad about thinking for yourself. Yeah? Tell me something. What is your favorite thing that you've learned from the Greatest Day? I like how after the Greatest Day, people won't die anymore. Hm. Sure. Okay. Well, did you know that there are stories just like that in every one of these books? There are? Mm-hmm. There are. So, how about we read some of them and we talk about them together? Lindsey would be mad. This is just between you and me. Lindsey's not gonna know. I promise. Okay. All right. Got one picked out. ♪ The Green Zone border fence is just up the hill from here. Maybe ten minutes. Keep your eyes peeled. Stick together. Let's go. You good? I can get your bag. I got it. Tough kid. I don't know where he gets it. From his mom, probably. So, what's going on with you and Katie? Nothing. Bullshit. Since you got here, you haven't even mentioned her name. She got involved... With... The Resistance. [scoffs] Did you really expect Katie Bowman to sit around the house and do nothing while the rest of the world turned to sh1t? Course not, but she didn't have to lie to me, manipulate me, put our whole family in danger. It's just getting my family back together felt like the one thing I could control. Maybe we couldn't beat the RAPs, but at least I could do that. And now? I don't know what's waiting for me on the other side of that wall. Are you kidding? The rest of your life. [dramatic music] ♪ I liked those stories we read, especially about the fish who got too big for the pond. That's a really good one. You don't believe in the Greatest Day, do you? No. I don't. Does that make you sad? Lindsey says you have to believe in the Greatest Day to be a part of it. I just don't want you to be left behind. [sighs, laughs] I know what Lindsey says. She's just a girl, love. She doesn't have all the answers. And neither do I. You know, you... you have to ask questions, and you have to trust your heart. No one can tell you what to believe. You get to decide that all by yourself. And look, you're... you're gonna make mistakes. That's how you learn. We all do. Even you? I've made lots of mistakes. What do you think about... about spending a little more time up in the Green Zone with your aunt and your cousin? Like when Daddy left to find Charlie? Yeah. Yeah, just like that. [sniffles] You and me this time, right? You know, it's a big house, and they've got everything you need. [voice shaking] Mom... what's wrong? Nothing, love. Are you worried about Daddy and Charlie? Am I worried? No. [sniffling] No, because I believe that your dad's gonna find Charlie, and he's gonna take good care of him. And you don't need to worry about that. What I want you to know is that I will always love you, no matter what. Yeah. I'm always right there, in your heart. [sniffles] Okay? Can we read another story? [laughs] Of course. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Go get a book. Go get a book. ♪ Mom, Bram, and Gracie... are... they alive? They're... they're fine. They can't wait to have you home. Why didn't you pick me up? ♪ 
♪ [phone rings] [whispers] It's okay. It's okay. Hello? We fumigated our office like you suggested, but I talked to my boss... it's not enough. I can't hold them off anymore. I'm ready to give you what you want. I need you to meet me alone. [knocking at door] Yes? I just talked to my source. He's giving us Broussard. When? Tomorrow. Maybe you're not quite as ill-suited for this job as I thought. Don't screw it up. [water dripping] [gate slides open] ♪ Where are you taking me? [door opens] [footsteps approach] [snaps fingers] Get out of here. You're Will Bowman's other son. I knew your name at some point, but I'm afraid it's gone. Bram. That's right. Like the guy who wrote "Jekyll and Hyde." "Dracula." I see you have a bit of your father in you. Not afraid to come into a man's office and correct him. Come on. Sit. Eat. So, they caught you going under the Wall. What did you see there? Nothing. It was empty. Then you got lucky. You knew my father. Please. I just want to go home. So do I. But I'm afraid that's gonna take some work for both of us. How would you feel about new boots? You trying to get me killed? That's a fair point. You're a bit more street smart than you look. What do you want? Our Neanderthal head of security is too dumb to see it, but rebellion is brewing in this camp. For example, the fights always break out in the loading dock. Never the bunks or the bathroom never the mess hall. The loading dock. Why do you think that is? Because they're stealing stuff. You're a fast learner. Runs in the family, I guess. Like I said, I want to get out of here too, and that's not happening unless I run a clean camp. No stealing, no resistance, no nonsense. But I can't do that without information. You want me to be your spy. If I help you, I get to go home? Do you know where your father is? My mom told me he went through the Wall to look for Charlie. Because I got him a transit pass. You see, you can trust me to keep my deals. Okay. [dramatic music] ♪ All right, everybody back. She's hot. [whirring] All right, we're rigged. Better get climbing. Okay. Remember, unclip, clip, every knot. Unclip, clip, every knot. All right. Let's see what you got now. I've climbed worse than this. I'll be right behind you. I'm not scared. I know. Hey, come on. [claps hands] You guys got to get going. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. Lead the way. Thanks. ♪ [carabiner clipping] [grunts] ♪ Hey. Nothing to see down here. Eyes straight ahead, okay? Okay. Okay. Let's keep going. ♪ [grunts] Oh... Dad! It's okay. I got it. Stay put. I'm coming. [grunts] Hang on, Charlie! All right. Grab this one. You're all right. You're doing great. You got it. [carabiners clipping] Come on, Charlie. We're almost home. Wait. [drone whirring] Move! Move! We got to move! ♪ [grunts] [breathing heavily] Come on, Will. Let's go... Devon! [both breathing heavily] It's okay, buddy. I love you, bud. [drone whirring] It's okay. ♪ 
♪ New boots. Don't lose 'em. That freak didn't take my boots. I wear 10 1/2. He's what? A 16? That was set up. You sent me to get my ass kicked there for a reason. Yeah. Sorry about that. I want to know why. [children chattering] You have kids? Nope. A pair of nieces in Texas. Or they... were. Sure. [clears throat] I meant what I said. You're out of time. You need to deliver. I'm gonna take my daughter up to my sister's place in the Green Zone. You can come, if you want. And then I'll walk into Homeland with you. You wanted a body. You've got me. [scoffs] I need Broussard. I told you I cannot get him for you. I wasn't lying. You know, after the Arrival, I was horrified by how easily people gave up their freedom, without even a real fight, just to keep some semblance of their normal life. Right now, I'd give you anything for one day with my husband and my kids in our old house. I can't live with a sword hanging over my head. It's okay. You can take me in. Or not. It's your call. You think that you can manipulate me... because I'm weak. I don't think you're weak. I... I think you have a conscience. Do you have a conscience? Do you ever think of the people who are dead because of you? Every day. It doesn't matter. I can't stop this anymore. It's bigger than just me now. I won't blame you. I mean it. I won't blame you. Gracie-girl, got to go! [sighs, sniffles] What's going on? I don't understand. It's like we talked about last night. You're gonna get to go up to the Green Zone with your Auntie Maddie and with your cousin. Grab your bag. Mom, I don't want to go to the Green Zone. I want to stay here with you. I know, sweet girl, and I wish you could stay with me too. Come here. I need to know that you're safe. You have a sweet soul, my girl. Trust your heart, and you'll always be okay. [clanking from outside] [footsteps approaching] Who is that? [tense music] [soft music] Charlie! Dad? Charlie. Dad. I'm here. [laughs] God, I missed you. [laughing, sobbing] My boy. [crying]
