 Previously on Colony... 
 We can trust him. He can help. 
 This column means that he's at a labor camp. 
 I'll be right back. 
 So we were able to isolate the sound that we're hearing. 
 [eerie humming] 
 Seems to have mathematical structure, but otherwise inconclusive. 
 I need you to find me an audio engineer. 
 There is a special shipment coming through your camp. 
 It's headed off planet. 
 My responsibility is to Gracie and her studies, and to teach her, I need a sound environment. 
 Get out of my house. 
 Where are you going? 
 My kid is sick. 
 Broussard-- one of his cell  came knocking on my door, asking for help. 
 That's not your problem. 
 It is if they take him to a hospital. 
 BB? 
 He was exposed to something. 
 [gunshot] 
 Your whole cell almost fell apart today. 
 You need to get your house in order before it comes down on all of us. 
 [man and woman moaning] 
 That's it-- like that. 
 [moaning] 
 Wait, wait, wait, wait. Can we stop? 
 Can we stop? Stop. 
 Yeah, yeah, of course. 
 [gasping] 
 [inhales deeply] 
 Breathe. 
 I'm sorry. 
 Don't be. You were great. 
 We should get up. I wouldn't want you to be late. 
 Let's-- let's just-- let's just-- 
 A little-- a little while longer. 
 Nothing would be better. 
 But you need to get going. 
 [clears throat, exhales sharply] 
 It's okay if you're nervous. 
 [breathes deeply] 
 It's a big day. 
 I'm not sure if I can-- 
 Hey... 
 This isn't about anything else. 
 It's about me and you, right? 
 Right. 
 [smooches] 
 [serious music] 
 ♪ ♪ To liberty. [indistinct chatter] ♪ ♪ Oh. [dog barking] [indistinct chatter over police radio] Next. Let's go. Let's go. ID? What's the holdup? Next! [wheezing] ID? This one's clear. [dog panting] Have your IDs and papers ready. Arms up. sh1t. Sorry. [dramatic music] ♪ ♪ All right. Clear. [breathing shakily] Are you okay? [wheezing] Next! ♪ ♪ All right, this one's good. Sorry. [dog barking] Hey! Stop, right now! Hands, put your hands up! Don't move! [dog barking] Get his papers. I made a mista-- mistake. I shouldn't be here. [dog barking] Get on the ground, now! Get on the ground! Please, I don't want-- I don't-- [device beeping] [people screaming] He didn't reach the target, but it's done. [dog panting] They're gonna want to know where I was yesterday. Can't you tell them that you were working on a case? [sighs] I can't get a cup of coffee without them asking questions. But you'll be okay, right? They need you. Till they don't. So what do you want to do about Bram? Now you have to fill out an application at work just to get on a computer. I can't open that file without causing more problems. My friends could probably open it. They're good at that sort of thing. All right, see what they can do with it. You sure? It's for Bram, right? That's all I care about. And you be careful. Okay. I'm disappointed. Maybe I shouldn't have expected so much, but before you returned from your sabbatical, all I heard about was the illustrious Detective Bowman. You haven't come as advertised. I've been on a short leash. Suicide bomber hit one of the Green Zone gates this morning. The details fit with the methodology of this "Red Hand" group. Our surveillance found footage of the bomber at a café two days ago. He was sitting with that woman-- Frankie Brun. We cross-indexed her face and discovered that she also met with a bomber who detonated himself in our lobby. That girl is our way into the cell. Squeeze her family and friends. Hopefully you can produce something. [sighs] You're on a short leash because of your methods. I just have a different way of doing things. You signed a vehicle out of the motor pool yesterday. Yeah, I needed a car. And you logged 38 miles. Seems like a lot for one sick kid. I wanted to follow up on a lead while I was out. If there's been some developments on our case, I need to be aware of them. Didn't want to bother you with it unless it was real. Turned out to be nothing. Tell me about it. Do you tell me everything you do? Guess we're both getting used to this partnership. [crackling] [knock at door] [gun cocks] How's everybody doing? Any heat on Will? Nothing yet. [door closes] What's on your mind? I have a file from the Deputy Proxy's Office. It's protected, but it's got all kinds of population data on the bloc, including information on where my eldest son, Bram, is being held. How do you know what's on the file if it's protected? Because my sister showed it to me. All I want's the information on my boy. You can do whatever you want with whatever else is on here. Shouldn't be too hard. Couldn't have been easy getting that. I took a risk for my son. [keys clacking] I'll be grateful for whatever you can do. We'll be in touch. [door closes] [dramatic music] ♪ ♪ [gasps] [both moaning] [panting] Sorry, I didn't, uh-- Hey, it's okay. I need you to get Snyder's key card. What? We have a Redhat. We need you to take a meeting with Snyder. When you go in there, he'll get him out of the room, and you grab his access card. Okay? [machinery whirring loudly] Some tea for everyone. Well, we'd like to help, detectives. Just tell us what we can do. When's the last time you saw your niece Frankie? Oh, I-I really couldn't say. Uh, maybe once or twice since the Arrival. Why? We have reason to believe she's involved with the Resistance. Oh, my. Well, I hope you find her. Order and duty. For a strong colony, every citizen must do his part. Yeah, order and duty. I want you to understand you can't protect Frankie. The people I work for see and hear everything, so it's only a matter of time before they find her. But right now you could still help her. Well... if Frankie got in league with some terrorists, then she deserves what's coming to her. Don't you at least want to know what she did? You wouldn't be here if she didn't do something illegal. Excuse me. [sighs] This is a dead end. They're nervous as cats, but they don't know anything. Maybe we could get, uh, a message to her, if you want to come back. [phone dialing, line trilling] We're ready, sir. Go ahead. It's for you. Who is it? It's your grandkids-- Jonah and Bella. They're with some friends of ours. We'd like to know where your niece might be hiding. Jonah? Jesus Christ, their grandkids? We stand on the line between order and chaos. Start making compromises, and you put us all in the path to anarchy. You set me up. No, I put a contingency in place in the event your methods failed. You saw through their cheap theater just like I did. You knew that they were lying, and yet you didn't press, but what I don't know... is whether it's because you're soft or because you're subversive. But I plan on finding out. You keep digging, Bob. See what you get. I don't think you realize how lucky we are to be doing this job, Detective. If you lack the necessary commitment to do our work, I'm sure that we can find a more devoted replacement. [dramatic music] ♪ ♪ Would you give us a minute? Mm-hmm. What's wrong? A sensitive file was downloaded from my office computer the night of the unveiling party. How do you know? I had a nice little visit from the Intelligence Ministry. Whenever anything's downloaded from the Authority's central server, they get pinged. They weren't happy. You didn't download it? Nope. Then who? I don't know. I thought you might. You think it's my fault? I mean, there were a lot of people at that dinner party. We always have staff in the house. That file contained information on prisoner allocations. It's a significant security breach. I need to know if anybody was in my office that night. How should I know? [footsteps approaching] [dramatic music] ♪ ♪ You know what? I'm good. Thank you. ♪ ♪ What's wrong? They're gonna hurt me. And why would they do that? I think they know that I'm talking to you. Why would they care... unless, of course, they're planning something? [door opens, closes] Not now. Sorry, sir, but this is important. [door opens, closes] [suspenseful music] ♪ ♪ [door opens, closes] Idiots. I'm dealing with idiots. W-what are you doing? If I tell you what they're doing and you catch them, will you send me home? I promise I'll do everything I can. They're planning an escape. When? During our shift today. They're gonna make a run at the fence. Hey. What's wrong? Hi, guys. Hey, Aunt Maddie. Hey, you mind giving your mom and I a minute to talk? Thanks. So what do you want to do? Uh, I don't know. What's up? If you wanted to know more about Bram, all you had to do was ask. What are you talking about? I know you took the file. What file? The one I showed you in Nolan's office. You triggered some sort of security thing, and now the Authority is asking questions. Mad, you had, like, a dozen people at your house that night. Why are you blaming me? You expect me to believe that someone else snuck into that office and stole the exact file we happened to be looking at? Maybe you downloaded it by accident? Oh, so I'm an idiot? Look... I'm sorry you and Nolan are in trouble, but I didn't take anything from your house. I wouldn't do that. Fine. But, Katie, this thing with Lindsey... for your sake, for how it looks, you have got to work things out with her. With what's happening, you do not want any extra attention. You're right. I'll, um-- yeah, I'll go speak with her, and I'll ask her to come back. Thank you for looking out for me. [tires screeching] 
 
 [indistinct chatter over police radio] You're on point, Detective. [gunshot] [explosion] Shot fired, shot fired! Agent down! Back on 6, take the house! Clear! Move! Go around the back, now! I got your back! [gunfire] [grunts] Grenade! [explosion] [gunfire] Collaborate and die! [growling] [gunshot] [exhales sharply] [sighs] [grunts] Come on. [restraints zip] Come on. [indistinct chatter over police radio] Who runs your cell? Who runs your cell? Who runs your cell? [breathes deeply] Who runs your cell? [crying] You asshole. [dramatic music] ♪ ♪ [gunshot] ♪ ♪ A year ago, I was homeless and in desperate need of medical care for my son. I wasn't sure I was gonna be able to navigate my way through it all. If you find yourself adrift, in search of knowledge, community. or spiritual peace... we say, "Welcome home." [cheerful music] Thank you so much for joining us at The Greatest Day Wilshire Boulevard Congregation. We hope you will make our home your home. You will not believe. They are very dangerous to you and to your family. You need to name them, cast them out. They cannot be trusted to do what's right. Okay, let's take a seat and read chapter five, all right? Mrs. Bowman. Hi, Lindsey. Did you come for the service? Uh, I came to apologize. I completely overreacted to the situation. I know you were just trying to do what's best for the children. And... Gracie misses you, and we'd love for you to come back to the house. I've actually been expecting you. [chuckles] It's natural to feel resistance to the truth of The Greatest Day. After all, faith is about struggle, and I see how hard you've been struggling to accept your new reality, but I want to assure you, Mrs. Bowman, that I'm not just there to help Gracie and Charlie. I'm there for you, too. I'm so glad. [dog barking in the distance] [knock at door] Ah, I'll be damned. You're Bonham? Yes, sir. There a problem? No. [chuckles] Phew. Sorry, just a big fan. I don't have much time. Hennessey said you might have something. Mm. More than something. Come on. You are a younger man. Any chance you remember the Apollo 10 mission? Nah. [eerie music] May 18, 1969-- the fourth manned mission to the Moon. NASA still hasn't figured out the source. Lots of conspiracy theories. Here's your file. The instant I heard it, I recognized the similarities. The Apollo riff had a much slower tempo, but digging in, both recordings have the same basic wave structure. And here's where it gets real weird. Both have a degrading time signature embedded in their audio spectrums. Meaning what? If you play them out long enough, they'll eventually come to an end. Like a countdown. Bingo. And here's the kicker-- that old Apollo recording was counting down to something, to a very specific moment. The Arrival. That's right. So what is this new music counting down to? How did it go? He'll know it's gone. He won't have time to know. What about after? When Snyder finds that key card missing, I'm the first one he'll throw in solitary. Haven't you ever wanted to be a part of something bigger than yourself? This is your chance. I saw something in you. The moment I first saw you on that bus, I knew you were one of us. [dramatic music] What do I need to do? ♪ ♪ Our group has a tradition. Before our missions, we make a toast. ♪ ♪ To liberty. To liberty. [electricity crackling, Frankie screaming] [gasping] Just answer the question. [electricity crackling, Frankie screaming] [crying] One question, one answer, and this all ends. Who runs your cell? I told you! I don't know! [electricity crackling] [screaming] That's it. You're killing her. Back off. Hey. Hey, hey, hey, Frankie. [crying] Try to breathe evenly, okay? Who are you, the good cop? Right now I'm your only friend. You have to give them something. This won't stop until you do. I don't know who runs the cell. I'm a recruiter. That's it. Who are you recruiting? How are you recruiting them? Boys. [breathing shakily] I find kids at the end of their rope, and I take them to bed. Well, you must have a handler, someone who gives you these attack targets. [gasps, breathing shakily] Hey, breathe, come on. Hey, hey. Hey, come on. I think she's in AFib. [grunting] Don't do that. Come on. Come on, breathe. Hey, step away from the suspect. Put your hand on me again. No, no, no, no, no, no. No, no, no! Come on! Come on, no! Come on, no, come on! Come on! Come on! [breathing rapidly] No. Call a medic! [sighs] It's okay. It's okay. [somber music] ♪ ♪ [scoffs, sighs] ♪ ♪ Hey... we got into Katie's file. And? Well, there's census information from the bloc from the day of arrival until now. Every month they're sending more and more people to labor camps or the factories. So we plotted the population numbers. They follow a perfect distribution curve. Like something you'd draw up in a calculus lesson. What's this? If the Y axis represents LA's human population, then this is the point where there are no more people. [dramatic music] ♪ ♪ To review... we successfully captured a key Red Hand operative, yet before we could extract any useful intelligence, she managed to kill herself while in our custody. Is that about right? The suspect is dead because he broke protocol, and now we have no one else to question. Yeah, because you shot them all. Just stop. You're supposed to be good at finding people, and you're supposed to be good at digging out the truth. Yet as partners, you have been an unmitigated disaster. I would welcome the opportunity to work with someone else, sir. Either fix this and bring me something... or I'll have your jobs. Group E report to the break room for your ten minutes. Group E report to the break room for your ten minutes, starting now. Okay, come on. Come on, let's go. Go, go, go, go. [metal clinking] [grunting] It's good. Go, go, go! [gunshots] Gates! [buzzer sounds] On your knees, now! Get down! Move! Get down! [alarm blaring, ringing] Now get down! Get down, now! [blaring and ringing continue] [dramatic music] [beeps] ♪ ♪ [beeps] ♪ ♪ [beeps] ♪ ♪ [air hissing, liquid bubbling] Who is that? I don't know. What are you doing? Making room. Help me. [air hisses] [grunts] [gasps] I think she's drowning. So? She's dead anyway. [choking] What's wrong with you? Help me! Hey! You need to focus. [gasping] [door opens, closes] Someone's coming. Go handle it. I need to set the bomb. ♪ ♪ [beeping, door opens] [door closes] ♪ ♪ [chuckles] Well, come on, you gonna use that? [baton clicks] Get up. [groans] [breathing heavily] Get out of here before they figure out you're gone. [exhales sharply] ♪ ♪ Mr. Bowman. Lindsey, you're back. Yes, and I'm afraid I need a moment of your time. I was trying to give Gracie her lesson, and Charlie was bouncing his ball against the house and refused to stop. I'm sure you understand that The Greatest Day expects its Navigators to be treated with a certain level of respect. I'd hate to have to report these subversive acts. [ball thumping] I'll talk to him. I'd appreciate it. [thumping continues] Come on, I want to show you something. I almost finished this before they sent me back to work, and I forgot about it. What is that? It's called a  makiwara. It's Japanese. Martial artists used it to practice their striking. Here, set it in there. It's pretty simple-- it's just a board with a pad of rice straw. The pad works on your knuckles. Build up calluses, so every punch makes you a little stronger. Give it a try. Remember, a good punch comes from your hip, not from your arm. [somber music] ♪ ♪ Hey, Charlie. ♪ ♪ [sighs] ♪ ♪ [insects chirping] Were you able to open the file? Bram's been marked for rehabilitation. He should be back inside of six months. Thank God. I need you back. I know who I am and who I'm not. I need a partner, someone who can help me think things through. I don't want to do this alone. I can't. I made promises. This is important. I have to focus on my family. This is about your family. The other information on that flash drive-- it matched something else we've been working on. This isn't a colony. It's a death camp. [ominous music] ♪ ♪ All right, keep moving! [woman speaking indistinctly over PA] Move up! [man speaking indistinctly over PA] Go! Hold up! What's our status? We've accounted for all the prisoners, except one, a girl. At least these idiots didn't keep us from getting the shipment out on time. The Authority would've had our ass. [alarm blaring] [ship whirring loudly] Lock down the prisoners and find Jenkins. Now! Yes, sir. Let's go! Into your beds, now! Have you seen Maya? Have you seen Maya? Be quiet! [serious music] ♪ ♪ Let's go! Where is she? Get in! You know where she is. Why? We thought we could get a bomb on that ship. We needed someone to detonate it during launch. Maya volunteered, and now she's a hero. There are gonna be consequences. We need to set an example for those who follow us with how we face them. I hope you're as strong as she was. Let's go! [crying softly] Lights out. ♪ ♪ [indistinct chatter] I can't do this anymore. I can't work for them. Bad day? [scoffs] Some good news maybe? [sighs] Bram is scheduled to be released from the labor camp. When? Six months. There was more on the file. The Occupation is sending more and more people to the factory every month. We're just a-a labor force for them, and they're burning through us like firewood. And it's not just the file. Broussard and his team found a-a coded countdown hidden in the RAPs communications. It ends on the exact day that the bloc will be empty. They're counting down to our extinction. Will, I made a promise to you that I was done with the Resistance. I can't keep sitting on the sidelines, not with this hanging over our heads. You don't know what we're doing to those people... The resources we're throwing into finding them. Working with the Resistance is suicide. And doing nothing is dangerous, too. [solemn music] ♪ ♪ Okay. Okay? We need to get out of this bloc... as a family, together, whatever it takes. ♪ ♪ How long do we have before the bloc's empty? Two years, three months, and nine days.
