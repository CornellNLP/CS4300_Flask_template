 Previously on "Colony"... 
 I'll believe you if you tell me that this was your wife's mistake and not yours. 
 I knew nothing about this. 
 There is a special shipment coming through your camp. 
 It's headed off-planet. 
 Did you ever have contact with the leader of the cell? 
 Yes. Her name is Karen. 
 Frankie's mother. 
 I know you took the file. 
 I didn't take anything from your house. 
 Bowman is working for the Resistance. 
 There is a growing resistance movement outside the colony. 
 What if this was an attempt to recover our Hosts' missing gauntlet and take it beyond our walls? 
 I made contact with the pilot. 
 I represent a resistance group based outside the colony. 
 I'm here because the real war is about to begin, and that thing you stole, it's gonna help us win it. 
 _ 
 Hey! Chuy. 
 Motion sensor just tripped. 
 Kill the lights. Cover the doors. 
 Got it. 
 I got the east side. 
 sh1t. sh1t! 
 sh1t. 
 Everybody, line up! 
 Have your ID ready when you get in there! 
 Thank you. 
 In troubled times, you can always turn to family. 
 That's what the Greatest Day is all about. 
 Family. 
 Good luck to you. 
 Over here, please. 
 Smile. 
 That's good. 
 Our numbers keep exploding. 
 I saw the report. 
 People are seeing the value in participation, aren't they? 
 Well, the ration kits don't hurt. 
 Yeah, I'm gonna keep pulling strings, dig up as many as I can. 
 I think it's important people see us taking care of our own. 
 I'm gonna find a bathroom before we head up the hill. 
 Sure. 
 You shouldn't be here. 
 You heard what happened. Of course I did. 
 They called Nolan. 
 I want you to get Hudson and meet me. 
 We'll get you underground. What? 
 They're gonna come for you. 
 That's ridiculous. 
 They won't blame me for your bad choices. 
 Of course they will. It's what they do. 
 Nolan won't let them. 
 Stop deluding yourself. 
 That man threw away his wife. 
 You really think he's gonna stand up for you? 
 Come with me. We're leaving the bloc. 
 Jesus, Katie. Think about your children. 
 That's exactly what I'm doing. No, you're not. 
 You're thinking about yourself, just like when you stole that file. 
 The file is the whole reason you need to leave the bloc. 
 The population numbers are absolutely... 
 So you admit it. 
 The only reason I'm in trouble is because of the things you did. 
 If you're wrong about Nolan and you need my help, tie a shoelace to the streetlight outside the Yonk, and I'll make contact. 
 What's it like out there? 
 Lawless. And empty. 
 They scooped up a lot of people when they walled up the big cities, and then they have big drone walkers that break up any major settlement, so most of the survivors are scattered. 
 Sounds like the wild west. 
 Yeah, basically. 
 And your group? 
 Some pros found each other, and we started reaching out. 
 We have a secure location in the desert. 
 And you can do something with the gauntlet. 
 We have someone who understands the alien interface. 
 We just need a device to be able to communicate with them. 
 The gauntlet controlled a drone. 
 Where is it? 
 The resistance group that murdered Hennessey, they stole it. 
 I gave it to him because there was heat on me. 
 Who took it? 
 A group called the Red Hand. 
 I want to meet them. 
 That's not advisable. 
 I came a long way to collect that thing. 
 I'm not going back without it. 
 You have to get out of the bloc first. 
 If I get you through the Wall, you take us back to your group. 
 I.D. please. 
 I'm here on behalf of Helena Goldwyn, the Governor-General. 
 She's concerned that you aren't getting the support that you need from Proxy Alcala. 
 We have everything we need. 
 Of course. We just want you to know that you have our full cooperation. 
 Wait. 
 You were the former proxy. 
 Yes. 
 You personally hired Will Bowman. 
 Why would somebody at your level get involved in such a decision? 
 We needed the help, and I thought that he was a special candidate. 
 Did you get to her? 
 We talked. 
 I'm sorry. 
 Where's the pilot? 
 Trying to get the gauntlet back from the Red Hand. 
 She got some balls on her. I give her that. 
 Is there a plan if she actually manages to do it? 
 If we get her out of the bloc, we can go with her. 
 You know a way out of here? 
 Tunnels, maybe. 
 Occupation has been sealing them. 
 Any other ideas? 
 I might know a guy. 
 What's going on? 
 You haven't said a word since church. 
 It's Katie. 
 I don't want us to pay for her mistakes. 
 I told you, I talked to Alcala. 
 You just got to make a statement to Homeland, and then we can put this whole business behind us. 
 I hope so. 
 Will you have lunch with us? 
 Yeah. I think I will. I just have to call the office. 
 Ms. Kenner. 
 I am from the Global Authority's Intelligence Directorate. 
 We have some questions for you. 
 Come with me. 
 After the Arrival, you were living in your sister's guest house. 
 I have a diabetic son. I was desperate. 
 So you were depending on her? 
 We went our separate directions. 
 I was fortunate enough to find Nolan, which led me to a role in the Greatest Day. 
 You worked a series of menial jobs in the Green Zone until you leveraged your knowledge of art into a position with Mr. Burgess' wife. 
 Then you took her place. 
 Nolan has changed my life. 
 I love him. 
 We know from one of your servants that your sister was here at the house on the day the file was illegally downloaded. 
 My sister did steal that file. 
 I know that now, but I was horrified. 
 I confronted her. 
 Yet you did not go to the authorities. 
 Why? 
 Because I wasn't sure. 
 And I couldn't send my sister and her family to the Factory if I wasn't sure. 
 You are a convincing liar. 
 Are you drawing horns on her like that? 
 That's very good. 
 Be right back. 
 Hi. Hi. It's Toby, right? 
 Yeah. What can I do for you? 
 Inside. 
 You're fine. 
 You're fine. 
 Howard Anderson. 
 What is... Your husband. 
 Where is he? 
 Changing. He'll be out in a... 
 Howard! 
 Howard! 
 Sit. 
 Look, we don't want any trouble. 
 Do you need supplies? Food? 
 Whatever you want. 
 Information. 
 Anything. 
 Just, please, leave them out of this. 
 What do you want to know? You run the Downtown Gateway. 
 I'm just a shift supervisor. 
 We need to know how the protocols work in the transit zones. 
 We need to know how to get through the Wall. 
 I can't help you. 
 The Gateways are a very complex system. 
 Lots of built-in redundancies. 
 Even if I cleared you on my side, another officer would have to clear you through a second checkpoint. 
 Who? 
 I... I've never even seen their face. 
 They come out of a different barracks. 
 Look. 
 Getting through an exclusion zone used to be hard, but now it's impossible. 
 There's virtually no traffic since they shut down the labor camps. 
 It's just one long graveyard shift. 
 Like I tell Toby every day. Don't I? 
 What about the VIPs? 
 They get the same treatment? Oh, yeah. 
 Even the Governor-General's convoy gets the full nine. 
 Heat scans. Walk-arounds. Sniffer dogs. 
 The only ones that get through are the Blackjacks. 
 Who? 
 These men in black. 
 Nobody really knows that much about them, so we just call 'em "Blackjacks." 
 They work for the IGA. 
 The group above the proxy and Governor-General. 
 These Blackjacks... they can get through without being stopped? 
 They have a transponder or something in their car that lets 'em get through without any interference. 
 My buddy got in trouble for asking them too many questions once. 
 He... 
 so now we just back off and shut up and let 'em pass. 
 You seem like a smart guy. 
 I'm sure you understand that reporting our visit will just get your family dragged down to Interrogation. 
 Believe me, I don't want any trouble. 
 Thanks for your time. 
 Sir? 
 You're expected outside. 
 Step into my office, Nolan. 
 Is everything all right? 
 You're dating the sister of a terrorist. 
 It's not like that. Really? 
 Then, explain it to me. 
 Maddie... look, she's got nothing to do with the Resistance. 
 Would you want to be blamed for everyone in your family tree? 
 Helena is maneuvering against me, and I can't afford to hand her any ammunition. 
 I'll fix it. 
 By walking in there and disavowing that woman. 
 Are you questioning my commitment? 
 Because I sent my wife to the Factory. 
 You and I built something here. 
 Don't ruin it for a piece of tail. 
 Is that a drone? 
 Yeah. 
 We're trying to get our own eye in the sky. 
 That's cool. 
 You don't really look like someone who'd be in the Resistance. 
 Why? 'Cause I'm not Sarah Connor? 
 Uh... 
 I'm kidding. You're right. 
 Eckhart convinced us to bug Homeland, which seemed like more of a stunt than anything else, and then we met Broussard, and... 
 now I'm here. 
 Guess that's life. 
 At times, it just puts you on unexpected roads. 
 Yeah. 
 Why don't they let you go outside with them? 
 'Cause I'm not fully trained yet. 
 Does that bother you? Nope. 
 I know exactly what I can do and what I can't. 
 I could help them. 
 I know a bunch of stuff, but they're never gonna give me the chance. 
 Yeah, but you're their kid. It's not just that. 
 They don't trust me. 
 Give it time. 
 What do you know about these Blackjacks? 
 Not much. Nobody does. 
 They showed up after you abducted the RAP. 
 I think they're trying to recover the gauntlet. 
 So we steal their car and use the transponder to get through the Wall. 
 Yeah, that should be easy. 
 These guys are good? 
 Cream of the crop. 
 Only way to do it is an ambush. 
 But we don't know their base of operations. 
 Their habits. 
 Where they report. 
 They're in the bloc looking for you. 
 Well, us. 
 We could be the bait. 
 Hmm. 
 Proxy Snyder. 
 So, you've come back to the bloc. 
 I have. 
 In what capacity? 
 I'm doing some fact-finding on behalf of the Governor-General. 
 I'm interested in Will Bowman's disappearance and his possible connection to Broussard and the missing artifact. 
 It's all in my report. 
 Is it? 
 Because some of the details in your report don't line up with what I know about Will Bowman. 
 I saw it with my own eyes. 
 He's a dangerous man. 
 There have been specific instructions from Proxy Alcala's staff. 
 I'm just trying to do my job. 
 You seem like a man on the rise. 
 Nice suit. Nice office. 
 A word of advice. 
 You don't want to bet on a loser. 
 I, of course, want to be on the winning side of things. 
 I knew you'd be a quick study. 
 You report to me now. 
 Anything happens in this bloc, I want to be the first to know about it. 
 I've returned from the dead, Mr. Bennett. 
 Do you really want to bet against me? 
 Would you mind sitting down? 
 No one'll hear me all the way over here. 
 It's not that. 
 You're making me nervous. Sorry. 
 It's just that we've been here for hours already. 
 Hey. 
 We need to be patient. 
 Hoping my sister sells us out? 
 You can go back to the bunker. We can handle this. 
 I'm staying here. 
 Okay. 
 You need to break her. 
 Quickly. 
 I can help. 
 Give me five minutes alone with her. 
 You have to help me. 
 I want to help you. 
 But first, you need to look me in the eyes and swear that this is real. 
 That you feel the same way about me that I feel about you. 
 You and Hudson are the only good things in my life. 
 I would do anything for you. 
 What about your sister? 
 She means nothing to me after this. 
 I hope I never see her again. 
 If you want to get out of this, you're gonna have to follow my lead. 
 Okay? 
 
 
 
 Not just today, but every day. 
 I understand. 
 There's only one way out now. 
 That her? 
 She made the signal. 
 What if Maddie really needs my help? 
 Do you really think that's why she came? 
 If the Blackjacks really did come after her, it's because of me. 
 We don't have to do it this way. 
 Just say no, and we'll scrap the plan. 
 I got to know. 
 Sir? 
 How did it go? 
 This is the right thing, you know. 
 I'm gonna check on the kids. 
 What's going on? Where are you guys going? 
 We're trying to find a way out of the colony. 
 I want to come with you. 
 I want to fight. Not happening. 
 So you and Mom can fight the Occupation, but not me? 
 That's right. 
 I need you to stay here with your brother and with your sister. 
 We'll be back before you know it. 
 My name's Bram. 
 I knew Maya. 
 Can I come in? 
 I met her in a labor camp. 
 Where? 
 Outside the colony. 
 We served time there together, and... 
 I got to know her. 
 She was strong. 
 I wouldn't have survived there without her. 
 I thought you should know that... 
 Maya fought for what she believed in. 
 She died for what she believed in. 
 Hello? 
 It's me. 
 Katie. 
 Are you okay? 
 You were right. 
 They came here looking for you. 
 Who? 
 I don't know. 
 Some intelligence guys in black jackets. 
 What'd you tell them? 
 That I hadn't seen you since... 
 We ran? 
 Yeah. 
 I'm scared, Katie. 
 I need your help. 
 Okay. 
 I'm here. 
 Where? 
 We'll come to you. 
 Do you remember where we all were when you told us you were pregnant? 
 Yeah. 
 Don't pack. 
 Get Hudson, and meet me there. 
 I don't know if I can. 
 You can. Katie. 
 I have an unmarked, dark SUV headed south toward you. 
 Hey, I got to go. 
 I... I'll see you at the meet. 
 Okay. 
 I love you. 
 I love you too. 
 Look out! 
 Ah! 
 I got the vehicle. 
 Coming around. 
 SUV on the move. Get to the front. 
 Move! 
 I'm out front. Status. 
 We're on the move, headed your way. 
 Copy that. Engine's hot. 
 Katie, stop! 
 Out of the car! Out of the car! 
 Get out of the car! Get out of the car! 
 You all right? 
 Had to lay low for a couple hours. 
 Homeland was running parallel sweeps. 
 Drones were everywhere. Same on my end. 
 Those Blackjacks ordered that drone strike. 
 You ever see anything like that at Homeland? 
 Human technology capable of controlling a drone? 
 Never. 
 The gauntlet's not the only thing they're looking for. 
 There was some kind of coffin in the back of that truck. 
 Coffin? Big enough for a man. 
 Looked like something... I don't know... like something you'd send into space. 
 Was there anyone inside? 
 No. 
 But their on-board computer had a bunch of dossier files open. 
 Your profile was in there. 
 They're looking for you. 
 They're looking for all of us. Not like this. 
 Doesn't matter. We're leaving the bloc. 
 We need to lay low for a while. 
 We don't have time to lay low. We need to get out of here. 
 That can't happen. Not now. 
 Really? 
 If you want to live down here, in my world... yeah. 
 Okay. That's enough. 
 That's enough. 
 You good? Good. 
 Did they find her? 
 Yeah, they did. 
 Did they capture her? 
 No. They didn't. 
 It went badly. 
 A disaster, actually. 
 What do you mean? 
 Most of Lieutenant van Warmerdam's unit was killed in an ambush. 
 Your sister escaped. 
 What does this mean for us? 
 I have no idea. 
 Who are you? 
 Bram Bowman. Who? 
 I worked in the camps with Maya and Edison. 
 They told me to come here. 
 They said to ask for "The Cardinal." 
 Come on. 
 Oh, yeah. Yeah, man. 
 That's excellent. 
 Bram Bowman. 
 Says he knew Edison and Maya from the camps. 
 Bram. 
 I was hoping that I'd get to meet you. 
 Sit. Sit with me. Please. 
 Thank you. 
 For what? 
 For your service in the war. 
 The destruction of the RAP ship resonated across the bloc. 
 It emboldened everyone. 
 People are starting to wake up, to see that one person can make a difference, and that's all because of the work that you and Edison and... 
 Maya did. 
 Maya and Edison are gone. 
 I hope that you can see they sacrificed themselves for something greater. 
 So, the Occupation released you from the camp? 
 I got in with the camp administrator, and got him to trust me. 
 And he took me with him just before the RAPs. 
 I'm the only one who made it out. 
 I am so sorry, Bram. 
 I can't imagine what you've been through. 
 But, after all that, you came here instead of going home. Why? 
 I went home, but there's nothing there for me. 
 What about your parents? 
 They don't know me anymore. 
 That's because, when they look at you, all they see is their son. 
 I see so much more.
