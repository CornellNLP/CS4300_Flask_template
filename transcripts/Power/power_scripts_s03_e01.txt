 Ghost :  Previously on Power... 
 Greg :  I saw them talking at Angela's apartment. 
 Man :  She's filed a formal harassment complaint, Greg. 
 You're suspended, effective immediately. 
 What are you doing here? 
 You sold me out because you know your boyfriend's dirty. 
 You know he's Ghost, right? 
 He's going down, Angela. You're going down with him. 
 I'm gonna leave town with the kids. 
 I want you to come with us. 
 Shawn :  Is it true? 
 Is what true? 
 Have you been using me this whole time to get revenge on Ghost? 
 You don't deserve to be my son. 
 Woman :  This is my fault, 'Keisha. 
 This the gun you used to kill your own son? 
 He wasn't my son no more. 
 He was your son.

You can't tell nobody what you didn't see, in case you get picked up again. f*ck you, Tommy. You stay out of trouble, nobody will have a reason to pick me up. Stay out of trouble. That's the point. We both stay out of trouble. Say I get nicked and you're with me, baby. Who brings the f*cking bail money? [cell phone buzzing] What up, J? Now? Yeah, I got something to do. You know what? Forget it.

Ain't nobody heard from Vibora... Ruiz might not be around anymore, but I bet that we could work something out. m*therf*cker, ain't nothing to work out. Whoever you are, this don't concern you. If you don't want trouble, blanquito... Whoa, whoa, whoa. You better go back to Midtown where you belong. Relax, because if you don't want trouble, y'all would get the f*ck off Soldado corners, because if you don't, I'm gonna be dragging his nuts across your face.

Yo, Tommy, if you don't come through soon, I'm gonna have to get my sh1t somewhere else, man. When's the re-up comin'? And where the f*ck is Ghost? ♪ ♪ I saw the head count. It's even more people than you said would show. We don't even know what the numbers mean. I mean, I think more people's better than not more people. We got good numbers tonight, but most of that sh1t's coming off the buzz of me buying the clubs from Stern. It ain't like slinging dope. Drugs sell themselves. Legit sh1t takes more work, more finesse. Looking the part is the first step. Could you go downstairs and make sure that security's got this place on lock? Last thing we need is someone getting in with a gun. Grand reopening, grand reclosing for real. All right, no doubt. I hear you. I got you, Ghost. Another thing. When we're here, use your real name. When you cross that doorway here, you're Andre, and forget Ghost. Call me James.

The club looked better because you were in it. Mm. The last time I was here... Oh, don't do that. Come on, Angie. I'd rather remember the first time. It's all kind of a blur. Is that a challenge? [snickers] Because I have no problem reminding you. What if someone comes in here? Well, too bad for them, because the doors automatically lock. Since when? Ghost : Since I got them fixed.

You told us you were gonna tell us when they called. They haven't called back yet, 'Riq. All they told me was that he passed. I just want to know what happened. Me too, baby. Me too. [somber music] [groans] Oh, sorry. That was my bad. I think I'm used to being in here alone in the morning. And I think I'm used to more space. I mean, you know, I love your place, but... No, no, it's fine. Of course you are. But you know what? We'll get the hang of it, and then we'll move. I thought you said you liked my apartment. Come here. Honestly, I'm a little nervous this morning. I'm going to ask my boss for a transfer to another department. Because? Angela : Because I think I'm ready for a change. Time to start something new. I want to be head of a department. Maybe in Victim Witness or White Collar, I'll have a shot. It could mean I'd be working more hours, though. Whew, with three clubs, I'll be working more hours, that's for sure. Not a lot of time left for you or for the kids. Hmm. I'm ready to meet them when you're ready for that, whenever that is. Sure, babe. Sounds good. I wasn't stalking her. I know you weren't, but when it comes to this sh1t, women have all the power. Nobody wants to get sued, especially not the DOJ. She should be in prison. She's f*cking James St. Patrick, and she knows that he's Lobos' New York distro. She knows he's Ghost. If you want to prove Angela had criminal intent to protect St. Patrick, you'd have to prove St. Patrick is involved with Lobos first, and this could all be moot anyway. I don't even know if we're going forward with the case. Lobos was stabbed in custody, severe injuries. Last I heard, it was touch and go. Holy sh1t. Looks like the Jimenez hit his whole network. Vladimir Jankovic and Drifty are dead. Ruiz is in the wind. You guys sure it was the Jimenez? Let it go. You'll come back off suspension. You'll transfer to another department away from Valdes and put this all behind you. Okay, you really need to get some, dude. You go blast one off to get your head where it needs to be. [laughs] Yeah. No, yeah, you're probably right there. You got any leads? I'm gonna let it go. Good. Thanks for coming by. [dramatic music] ♪ ♪ Stern's VIP guest list. I got it right before he fired me, and then I deleted the file from his records. It'll take him at least a month to rebuild it. That's nice work. I set up those new meetings with the, uh, new security firms like you asked. Good. Time to upgrade there too. Agreed. I'm gonna head over to Verbatim. Kantos, Andre here's gonna go over with you so you can show him around. Give us a minute if you will. All right, so look, man. This club sh1t is all right, but I want to know when we're gonna mix it up, move some weight. Look, I figure, you know, since you're not f*cking with Tommy no more, you need somebody in that shotgun seat. I mean, just holler at your boy, man. What's our new hustle? The club is the new hustle. I promised to get you off of a corner, to get you out of the hood. I guaranteed you a fat paycheck, but you're gonna put that sh1t in the bank, not in your goddamn mattress. I said I want to look clean like you. I ain't never say I want to be clean. I want money, man. You're gonna get that. You want a better life for your daughter or not? You want to look over your shoulder the rest of your life? So you not looking over your shoulder, just like that? I was thinking if I want to move forward in my career, maybe Violent Crimes isn't the best place for me to do it, at least not here in Southern District. You want a transfer? I want a fresh start, and when Greg Knox comes back to work, it might be best for me to be somewhere else. I think there's some openings at the Eastern District office out at Cadman Plaza... I'm sorry, Angela. You can't go anywhere. I need you here to help the Lobos task force. I thought the case might be over. You thought wrong. Lobos woke up. He's stable. So we're proceeding with the case. We're due in chambers in 20 minutes. [dramatic music] ♪ ♪ [keyboard clicks] In light of the government's inability to protect my client, Felipe Lobos, I move that all federal charges against him be dropped and that he be returned to Mexico, where the Federales can handle his prosecution. You know they're not gonna prosecute him. You're looking for a get-out-of-jail-free card. Get-out-alive, Mr. Sandoval. My client's life is in danger as long as he's in your custody. Cross : It's clear that whoever wanted the defendant dead knew exactly where to find him. Has the government addressed the issue of the defendant's safety in its papers? Not at this time, Your Honor, but it's clear the Jimenez hired an assassin from within the prison. Your Honor, if you send Lobos to Mexico, he'll go right back to conducting business, selling drugs, ordering murders... That's the Federales' problem. Your Honor, if I may, what if we helped the idea that Lobos is dead? Helped? We freeze his assets. We start seizing his American properties. We spread the word through the prison system that the Jimenez killed the defendant, and we mount a John Doe prosecution. We never put his name on a prisoner manifest, we move him in secret, and all materials associated with "U.S. v. John Doe" remain under seal. Your Honor, the Eastern District has prosecuted almost 60 John Doe cases in the last five years. You want my client to waive his right to a public trial because you can't keep people safe? Angela : A John Doe prosecution would give the government the ability to protect the defendant while prosecuting him for his crimes against the people of the United States. It is a solution in the interest of justice. Isn't that why we're here? Game, set, match, Mr. Kessler. The government's motion is granted, and the John Doe prosecution will move forward. Mr. Sandoval, I expect extraordinary measures here from your staff. No DOJ property leaves the building, no laptops, no files, and restricted smartphone use. I understand, Your Honor. All proceedings from this point shall be maintained under seal, Counselors. I'm due in court. You'll see yourselves out? I'd like to go with you to interview Lobos if that's okay, Mike. I'll get back to you. [dramatic music] ♪ ♪ The kids are at school already. I know they aren't here. Came to talk to you. Tasha, when they are here, we need to sit both Tariq and Raina down and... tell them about Angela. About Angela? What about Shawn, Ghost? What about the fact that someone who was in their lives is suddenly dead with no explanation? Don't pretend like you didn't know. I knew. Then why didn't you tell me? The police called me to identify his body. I called you, Ghost. I had to tell the kids about Shawn alone. What'd you tell them? That he died, Ghost. What else was I supposed to say? [scoffs] You got anything you need to tell them, anything you want to get off your chest? What happened to your face, Ghost? Were you in a fight? You think I did this to him? I told you, I sent him away. You tell me a lot of things. I told Shawn that Kanan was using him to get to me. Instead of leaving town, Shawn went to Kanan to confront his father about what I told him. And Kanan shot him. ♪ ♪ So my face looks like this, um, because I killed Kanan. [scoffs] Kanan is dead? And Lobos too. I'm out the game. Why should I believe anything you have to say? ♪ ♪ I know it's easy for you to blame me for Shawn's death, and I know I've lied to you in the past. Mm-mm, don't touch me. I'm sorry you had to do that alone. I should have been here. But you can ask Tommy. When he went to see Kanan, I was with Tommy, getting him out of jail. Call me when you're ready to talk. ♪ ♪ [rock music] So, man, the heat you were getting from the feds, it's all gone now? All gone. They can't even try to come get me now.

I'm gonna get you the best product at the best price. The shipments will be reliable, and they'll be on time. And not on Sundays. I'm a little busy on Sundays. Yeah, I got you.

♪ ♪ You'll be hearing from me soon. You're way more expensive than the other top security firms. I've heard we're about twice as much. You heard right. We're worth it. My men are military trained at identifying conflict and suppressing it before the situation gets out of hand. They contain and control because once a brawl breaks out, it's too late. If you hire me, you and your patrons will be completely safe within these walls, safer than they've ever been before. Darryl, it's Ange. I need to talk to you about Greg Knox. [knock at door] That was nice work with Judge Cross today. You know, she's a battle-ax, but she never ignores precedent. I think we both rose to the occasion. That's what's so frustrating about you, Valdes. You know how to be a good prosecutor when you want to be. Maybe that's why Mike keeps you around, 'cause you're the Calamity Jane of this f*ckin' department, and yet somehow you're still on this case. I guess you've forgotten how we arrested Lobos in the first place. If it gets out that Lobos is alive, whoever tried to kill him the first time will come back for round two. That could happen. Could? Will. And if Lobos isn't kept under strict seal, he could order a preemptive hit, give orders for a retaliation kill right from his cell. The person who ordered the hit would be in danger. I don't give a sh1t if one of the Jimenez assholes gets clipped because they tried to kill Lobos, but my career is on the line here. Any mistake you make to jeopardize this case, I'll go to Collins if I have to... I don't give a f*ck... to make sure you're removed. [dramatic music] ♪ ♪ 
 
 Tommy, what the hell? What you want, Tash? I want to know why you haven't been returning my calls. I've been trying to tell you that Shawn is dead. What happened to him? Ghost says Kanan did it and that he killed Kanan afterwards, but I don't believe a word that m*therf*cker says anymore. Oh, yeah? Me either. Good luck with that. What happened between you? It don't matter what happened. Can't change it now. Tommy, for the kids. They need an explanation. I need to know if Ghost killed Shawn the night of that party at Truth, the night you got out of jail. Ghost was with me. He picked me up. I know he killed Kanan too. He ain't lying about that either. I'm sorry about Shawn. I'm sorry the kids got to go through that. Ghost says he's out the game now. That why you're mad at him? Good-bye, Tasha. Is this a commentary on my cooking? If I said no, would you believe me? Mm. You know, it was nice having you at the club the other night. It felt right. Yeah, for me too. Think you can come again tomorrow? You know, if you don't have to get up too early? Yeah, maybe. Jamie, there's something we need to talk about. [cell phone buzzes] I have to go to Truth. The club doesn't open until 10:00. You got to go right now? Yeah, right now, baby. I'm sorry. You know, some nights, things come up unexpectedly. It's part of the nightlife business.

Actually, I want to ask you a few questions about Thomas Egan and James St. Patrick. I haven't seen Tommy Egan in a very long time. He never really hung out here much. As for James, anything you want to ask him, you can ask him directly. He'll be in tomorrow. Now, if we're all done here, I'd be happy to cover your tab. Whole thing? Mm, thank you.

Now, I'm doing what I can to impede the progress of the case. The La Araña cards went back to the NYPD precincts for each individual murder. When we want them back for evidence, it'll take a year to find them. The only witnesses that can hurt you are Ruiz, who we're looking for, and Ghost. I have that under control. I will let you know when we find Ruiz. Why in the world would I ever give up my U.S. attorney that I have in my back pocket? I'm assuming that Ghost is keeping his, right? Angela is with him, yes, and I told you, she may be useful later to help destroy your case. She wants to be present at your next interview. Bring her. I want to see if she breaks under pressure. If she's weak, she may present too great a risk. If anything happens to Angela, it will blow back on both of us. A U.S. attorney dies while prosecuting you? Forget it. You have to trust me, Jefe.

Mike :  I take it, Mr. Lobos,  that your lawyer has explained the John Doe prosecution to you. Yes, yes, yes, he has. Overnight I have no name, no money, nothing. It's... it's like I ceased to exist all because I had the grave misfortune of being stabbed while I was in your custody, so I understand. Would you please describe the events of the morning you were injured? Mr. Kessler, can you control your client, please? We can talk about cocks all day, Mr. Lobos, but you are going to have to answer my questions. You can say whatever you want to me. I'm not afraid of you. Is that a threat? We can add charges to the indictment. What do you want to know? Your meal was delivered. The slot was opened. What happened next? The only reason why I am still alive is because the Jimenez are so cheap. You get what you pay for. [chuckles] Shut up. And you're sure the Jimenez sent the assassin?

He literally pulled his mask off and told the guy's friend to spread the word. He would have never done that if you were there. He says you're out. What the hell happened? He's right. I'm out. This club, this life, this is who I am now. I didn't get in this game to work for Tommy. You got me out of the gang, you. You set me up so I can take care of my family, not Tommy. What do you want me to say? Tommy Egan's the boss now. Guess you better do what he wants. Well, then I better go do a pickup down on Elizabeth. sh1t, I best hit the road. You're still doing pickups on Elizabeth? Yes. Nothing's changed. [dramatic music] You telling me you're still working with Lobos? Why wouldn't we be? Tommy didn't say sh1t, but my guess is, Lobos is still inside moving weed. Nothing's gonna stop the m*therf*cker till he's dead. We need you out on these streets. I need you. Tommy's gonna get us all f*cking killed. ♪ ♪ Take care of yourself, man. What is that supposed to mean? It means take care of yourself. [door shuts] [man speaking indistinctly] ♪ ♪ Hey, Darryl.

I know, but if you're really that concerned about it, you need to go through the proper channels. Get a protective detail. You know I love you, but you're real radioactive around here these days, and if I get caught helping you, I can get fired. Good luck with Greg, Ange. Darryl... [sighs] [dramatic music] ♪ ♪ What the f*ck? What's up, Dre? You need something? Man, I was just looking for a tie. Aren't I Andre now? Yeah, I guess so. Yo, you strapped? I mean, never leave home without it. You want me to change that too? No. All right. Hey, James, I called you last night. You didn't pick up. I need to talk to youse about something right now. I want to know, did you send invitations to the grand opening for Verbatim? Yup. To everybody on Stern's VIP list? Yeah, every single one. It's right here. Perfect, thanks. It's not about that, though. It's all right. We'll talk later, I promise. Hey, folks. Woman : Hi. I want to extend my appreciation to you all for stepping up to make the launch of JSP Nightlife come to fruition. [applause] An ideal employee is loyal, trustworthy, fully committed. I've been trying to find someone that can serve in the role of general manager for all three of our clubs. Josh Kantos, would you come up here, please? Man : Nice, Josh. Woman : Yeah, Josh. Kantos here is the exact opposite of everything I want this place to be. From now on, this lying, bullshitting, backstabbing piece of sh1t isn't welcome on these premises. If you see him here after today, in fact, call security. Matter of fact, I think they're ready for him now. James, James, you need me. You... you can't run this place without me. I can, and I will. Get him the f*ck out of my sight. Loyalty is everything to me. I deserve it, and I demand it. Now, let's get to work. Yo, Tommy, that sh1t with Chuleta, man, I'm hearing it from everybody, yo. Yeah? Now people know not to f*ck with us or with you. Glad to hear it. Yo, good looking out, man, for that and the weight. Got it this morning. Mm. Vaya. Vaya. Nice work getting the product out to them so fast. Yeah, man, we got the weight, but the shipment was light. You feed the Soldados first? Reward Poncho's loyalty? No doubt, but the other primeras might get pissed. Can you think of a reason why Lobos wouldn't send the full amount? No, I'll ask him, though. Listen, as far as the streets are concerned, Lobos is dead. Only you and I know any different, all right? Why does he want people to think he's dead? I don't know, and I don't care. I'm just doing what that crazy m*therf*cker says. Look, Ghost ain't coming back. I'm number one now, and you could be number two, but you ain't never gonna second-guess me again. Either you're in, or you out. I'm in. Good. Never really reheats the same. Yeah, you're right. Who was that guy last night? What guy? At the club, with the big 718 tattoo on his neck, Latino, tall. It's a gang tattoo, Toros Locos in the Bronx. Look at you. Been holding out on me. I never knew you ran with the Toros. You promised to forgive my past. Mm, I promised I would try. Who is he, and why did he come to the club last night? He grew up in the Toros. I got him out a few years ago. His name is Julio. And what does he do now? Now? I can't tell you that.

Because if we can't be honest with each other, may as well give up right now. ♪ ♪ Felipe Lobos is alive. What? He survived the attack in prison. All the records are sealed.
