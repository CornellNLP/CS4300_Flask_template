 I already programmed the information on his phone. 
 You'll be able to read his text messages, view his incoming and outgoing call logs. 
 Carlton Hotel. 
 Angela told me her investigation is actually not about Tommy. 
 She wants Lobos. 
 How long you been smashin' Tasha? 
 If anything, I'm using her for information like you wanted. 
 Tell me one real thing she told you. 
 I know that Uncle G's going to a big meeting tomorrow afternoon at the Carlton Hotel. 
 Tommy trusts me. I'm gonna surprise Ghost at the Lobos meeting tomorrow. Tell Lobos to his face. 
 Ghost and Tommy done lost control of the organization. 
 ...why a guy like you needs my services. 
 I feel like I can trust you. 
 What makes you think that? 
 Angela : I just saw the distributor going into the meeting with Lobos. 
 FBI! Get on the ground! 
 Angie! I'm gonna get you, Angela! 
 Your uncle set me up. I want you to right Ghost's wrong for separating us by taking him out. 
 You in? 
 I'm in.

[ quiet chatter ] Who the f*ck are you? An angel of mercy. Now shut the f*ck up and sit down. [ door closes ] Bailiff : All rise. The honorable Judge Jennifer LeFevre. Good morning. Be seated. We're on the record. Case number 6796969. DM 184, United States of America vs. Thomas Patrick Egan. This is a bail hearing to determine whether defendant Egan should be released on bond. Good morning, Your Honor. Angela Valdes for the United States of America. With me is Assistant U.S. Attorney Cooper Saxe. Good morning, Your Honor. Joseph Proctor, council for defendant Thomas Egan. Good morning, Mr. Proctor. Does the government wish to be heard first? Defendant Egan's ties to the community are loose. He has an extensive criminal record, financial resources, and the intelligence to make a good faith escape. We feel that Mr. Egan is a danger to the community and that there is a significant risk of flight. Defendant Egan should be held without bail until his trial. Mr. Proctor, does the defendant wish to rebut the presumption at this time? If I may, Your Honor, despite Mr. Egan's past record, his recent behavior shows he has now become an upstanding member of the community as a business owner. I assure you, Your Honor, Thomas Egan is of no flight risk. He wants to stand and clear his name. Having considered the arguments of council, the pre-trial services report and recommendation, the court finds that no combination of conditions can assure the defendant's appearance for trial. Therefore, bail is denied. Defendant is remanded to custody to await trial. Trial date is set for the 23rd at 9:00, Nice work, Valdes. You know I'm handling the trial, right? We'll see. When do I get my f*ckin' phone call? [ moaning ] [ R&B music playing ] [ laughs ] See? Mm. This is how I want things to be. Me and you. [ chuckles ] Me, too, Shawn. I know you're still married to Ghost, but... if we really want this, can't we make it happen? Maybe. [ giggles ] [ phone ringing ] Oh. It could be the kids. Hello? Yes, I'll accept the charges. Tommy? Okay, okay. Slow down. What happened? Where the f*ck is Ghost? Gentlemen. Great work at the bail hearing. Thank you. But Proctor seems to be on his game. With a case this big, gotta make sure we're firm on all points. Wanna box them in. We have Egan in possession of a large amount of cash with intent to exchange those funds with a known cartel leader, who, by the way, was in possession of numerous unlicensed firearms. Tell me, how are they gonna get out of that box? How did you know they were going to be there? I had an unofficial tail put on Egan a couple of days ago. Set it up through Vice, tracked him to the location. I should've said something, I know. Can't say I like things going on behind my back, but we're here now. I owe you a drink. My treat. You nervous? Ready. Egan's gonna get what he deserves. Hope so. You know, I heard what you said to Mike. You and I both know there wasn't a tail. I know you grew up with James St. Patrick, but he's gonna have to come forward. Friends or not, he's gonna have to make a statement, testify against Egan. And you're gonna have to explain how you found the location of the Lobos meet. And if he's the answer, you're gonna have to bring him in to Mike. [ knock on door ] Hey. Hey. You changed your cell. Why? Well, because my number has a tendency to get into the wrong hands. So you arrested Tommy? Guess you were right about him all along. He was standing in a hotel room with Felipe Lobos when the agents walked in. You got Lobos, too? Hmm. So you don't need Tommy now. You told me it wasn't really Tommy you were after. But Tommy was arrested with Lobos and guns and a lot of money. Can you help him? The only way out of this for Tommy at this point is to testify against Lobos. Well, that's not gonna happen. Tommy won't snitch on Lobos, so there's gotta be another way, Ange. Baby, you're from the same neighborhood. It violates everything we believe in to betray a friend. You know that. Hey, come here. You gotta consider what matters to you most. You know, babe? And then you can make a decision that goes against every rule you know. But you better consider carefully. I'll think about what I can do for him. I know you will. You try and clip a nigga like Ghost, you gotta be precise. On point, you hear me? This ain't his first time at the wrong end of the gun. Put this on the gun tonight. It goes in the front. Look, before the actual meeting and sh1t like that, just hit me right quick, one, two, let me know we in motion, all right? All right. And then what? When you get in the car, you do what you normally do... drive. All right? You want him to relax. Don't talk, don't bullshit, turn the radio on. Play whatever the f*ck the nigga like. You got tints on that truck, right? Yeah. No one can see inside. Look, there's an alley in the West 20s. It's about a couple minutes away from his club. It ends in a garage, dead end. Nobody'll be back there. You get to the alley, simple and plain... you turn around and you shoot him. In broad daylight? [ scoffs ] Kanan : You just said the truck got tints on it. Ain't nobody gonna see the muzzle flash. Right. After you do it, you got a short ride over to this warehouse. It's not too far from here, all right? Give him the address. We'll take it from there. Once you shoot him, he's gonna be suckin' wind and sh1t tryin' to get air. Eyes glazed, mouth like a f*ckin' fish. Can you handle that? Yeah, I can handle it. It's gonna be a long car ride with a dead body from Manhattan to Queens, man. Don't get pulled over. Don't trip and miss a stoplight, m*therf*cker. I won't. You sure about this? If you don't want to do it, let me know now. I'm in. I said I'm in, I meant it. All right. I guess that dick ain't what it used to be. Tash, what the f*ck? She beat you. I told you to keep f*cking her to control her mind and she beat you anyway. Lower your voice. Tommy's in f*cking jail. We're about to lose everything because Angela was smarter than you. Slow down. Got the whole thing under control. You got the whole thing under control? Yes. Is this the plan you told me about? You left out the part where Tommy's in jail and you're not. This is just like Kanan all over again, huh? I'm not doing this sh1t here. Except you didn't want to tell me because you knew that I wouldn't help you sell Tommy out. This why I saved the fed bitch's life? So she could arrest Tommy? It's not like that at all, T, okay? [ scoffs ] I would never do Tommy that way. Yeah, and you know what? The old Ghost wouldn't. But you know what? I don't know you. You are not the man I married, not by a long shot. I haven't changed. I'm taking care of Tommy and it's all gonna work out. If something happens to him on the inside, or if... if he gets convicted... It's not going to happen! Mm. I f*ckin' said I got it. You're playing with fire, Ghost. You just better make sure we don't all get burned. Egan. You f*cked up my bail hearing. Come on, even I couldn't win that one. You were caught red-handed. Who's paying for you? Where is he? He sends his regards. Well, why the f*ck ain't he in here with me? He was running late. [ scoffs ] By the time he got there, the feds had surrounded the building. But he wants you outta here. That's why he hired me. So he just happened to be running late the same day his f*cking girlfriend magically knows the location of our meetup with Lobos? Girlfriend? Oh, sh1t. He ain't tell you? That bitch who beat you in court, he's been f*ckin' her for months. How do I know that you aren't here to keep me inside while the two of them try to pin everything on me? Okay, look. If you don't trust me, I'm happy to go. You can get a federal public defender. Some asshole who's handling 30 cases at once. Or you can stick with me. I'm in the Tommy Egan business. I'm expensive as f*ck, and your boy's paying full freight to make sure you walk. So which is it? Should I go? It's your call. Going once... going twice... Sit the f*ck down, Counselor. Proctor : Told him what you wanted. Good. How's he doin'? [ elevator dings ] He asked about you. He sounds suspicious. Ghost : When you told him what happened, what did he say? He said you were f*cking the prosecutor. It's not a conflict of interest. It's a benefit, trust me. She can help us from the inside. You just better know what you're doing. Just call me the moment the prosecution's evidence arrives, okay, Proctor? Look, I've been doing this a long time. Egan's the paranoid type. You sure you just don't want me to tell him everything? No. You make sure he doesn't say a f*cking word about Lobos to anyone. Got you. [ sighs ] Get off that phone. I need your undivided attention. Hamilton Contracts came in. They want to roll out their next line of watches right here. Whoo. You talkin' later in the spring or summer? We're talking Saturday. How about that? Nah, we can't pull that off. No way. Overhead, not to mention acquiring all necessary permits, police, security personnel. Permits, police, security, all taken care of... the whole shebang. Really? Yeah. If we do this right, we'll pull in the biggest haul since we started. You might hit your mark. No might about it. Ahem. What's that? Oh, gotta get all these records shipped over to Stern Headquarters uptown. I send them at the end of the week. Everything has to be accounted for. I hear that. [ groans ] I hate f*ckin' paperwork. It's the most annoying part of any case. It's a million copies for a million different people. Yeah, but you get it wrong, and it blows everything up. You throwing him in? Rolla? Hold off. We were never able to confirm enough to establish a link. Never connected Egan all the way. Don't want to be presumptive. Good point. Did you talk to Mike about James St. Patrick? I will after we complete the transfer. If everyone can take a moment, we have a guest. Oh, it's great to see you, sir. Looking slim. [ chuckles ] Mike was telling me you guys are in the middle of producing discovery. Yes, sir. The defense for all parties should be in possession of our evidence by the end of the day. That's good to hear. And I understand it was you who helped find Lobos. Yes. Yes, sir. Well, that's good work, Valdes. Real good work. Reflective of our training. Look, everyone take note. We need more initiative like this. Ahem. Look, Justice wants to ensure the conviction of Felipe Lobos. And in order to gain that assurance, we're willing to be lenient with the distributor's involvement if he were to cooperate. You talking about offering Egan a deal? Collins : Egan's a small fish. Justice wants Lobos. So let's make sure we finish the job. Get Egan to sing. All right, well, that's everything. All the bank statements, everything you had sent to my house. What are you gonna do with $200,000, Tasha? That's like your shoe budget for a week. I don't know, 'Keisha, okay? I'm trying to figure it out right now. What's going on, Tasha? I ain't never seen you like this, and I know you're not being straight with me. Let's just say Ghost is in way too deep with Angela. Oh, that bitch. Yeah, that bitch. And I gotta protect myself and the kids. [ sighs ] Look, I may need to go away, 'Keisha. Not tell anybody where I'm going, not even you. You hidin' money from Ghost and now you wanna hide his kids, too? If he finds out what you up to, girl, I don't know what he would do to... He's not gonna find out, okay? I'll be long gone before he suspects a thing. I know you're strong, Tasha. And I'm not just saying this 'cause I'd miss you. But do you really have to go off and start a whole 'nother life by yourself? Can't you find another way? Ruiz : Where's he at? Dre : Heads up. Ruiz : Finally. Not planning on staying long? I agreed to hold off on killing Ghost and take part in your plan, Kanan, 'cause you assured me that you would be able to use Tommy to align yourself with Lobos. However, both Tommy and Lobos were arrested  and we are no closer to meeting him. Explain to me why I do not rid myself of all of this and go my own way. Vladimir's got a point, Kanan. We're all in the same boat. That last distro I received is running low. We need something new or we're gonna be forced to look at other options. So what's your plan? No need to do anything. Ghost'll be dead by tomorrow. [ distant dog barking ] After Ghost is dead, we can discuss business moving forward. Ghost being dead is something we all want. But how does that get us closer to our objective with Tommy and Lobos in jail? M*therf*ckers like Lobos been arrested before. He not gonna stop dealing, not now. Nothing has to change. After I kill Ghost, move him out the way, he'll have no choice but to come to me. I hope for your sake it plays out as you see. [ elevator dings ] Tasha : Shawn? Hey. What'd you want to talk about? Come here. [ exhales ] This sh1t with Tommy. Ghost says he has it under control, but I really don't know that he does. I think Tommy could go to jail for good. Seems like Ghost is willing to take the f*cking risk. I could see Ghost making that call. I don't know him anymore. I don't know if I'm next, Shawn. I don't know how far he'll go, and I need to protect the people I care about, and I can't do that here. I'm gonna leave town with the kids. Where would you go? I don't know, honestly. But far away. Far away from here, from Ghost. But I don't want to go alone. I want you to come with us, with me. This is all I ever wanted. And I'm gonna make you happy. You and the kids. I just need a couple days. I can wait. All right, look, as my associates continue to review the evidence you delivered, this witch hunt remains unsubstantiated. My client tells me he stumbled into the wrong hotel room. It's a simple case of wrong place, wrong time. If he had any information regarding Mr. Lobos, he would be happy to cooperate. Yeah, there were a lot of Mexicans in that room. Which one was he? Sandoval : Mr. Egan, you're looking at going away for a very long time. So what I can offer you begins and ends with what you can offer me. [ sighs ] If you want this Lobos guy, I can't do nothin' for you. Can I go back to my cell now? Angela : Threats aren't gonna break him. Everyone's got a soft spot. Greg, come with me. I got an idea. [ door opens ] [ compartment closes ] [ phone buzzes ] Hey. Uncle G's on his way out. Kanan : Uncle G? You need to get this sh1t out of your mind right now, boy. He ain't your uncle no more. m*therf*cker never was. He just another nigga standing in front of the life you want. Yeah. Yeah, you're right. I'm good. Kanan : All right, stick to the script. Holla at me when it's done. I got you. What's up, Uncle G? What's up, Shawn? [ phone buzzes ] [ sighs ] Midtown. Meeting's in 30 minutes. Absolutely. Kanan's voice : When you get in the car, you do what you normally do... drive. All right? You want him to relax. Don't talk, don't bullshit. Turn the radio on. Play whatever the f*ck the nigga like. [ rap music playing ] No music. I'm expecting a call. [ turns radio off ] Uh, sure thing. Kanan's voice : You get to the alley, simple and plain... you turn around and you shoot him. Your uncle set me up, sent me to jail. All those years I was gone, Ghost robbed us of that time. Man : Hey, where you goin'? [ pounds ] Road's closed. Everything okay, Officer? Water main burst about an hour ago. Where you headed? What? I can give you an alternate route. Um, midtown. Okay, a little off-target, but okay. Uh, take a left. Left on 8th. It'll get you right over there. Go ahead. Thank you. Ghost : Remind me to talk later. I've been thinking about it. Maybe you're right about that promotion you asked about. Oh, yeah. Great, Uncle G. [ whirring ] [ beeps ] [ clicks tongue ] [ sighs ] Shouldn't have let a boy do a man's job, huh? What you wanna do now? Plan B, m*therf*cker. How much longer we gotta be in here for? We're gonna be here a while, so get comfortable. [ yawns ] 
 
 Egan, got something to show you. You got a visitor. You M*therf*ckers. What the f*ck is my mom doin' here? Well, you're staring at a lengthy sentence, Mr. Egan. And I'm sure the funds you give her aren't all included in your tax return. And once you're in prison with all your assets frozen, how will Mommy make her house payments? [ laughs ] Medical bills, insurance... man, that stuff is expensive. Mm-hmm. And I'm sure she needs her medicine. Let's leave his mother outta this. She can keep her life the way it is, Mr. Egan, if you talk. Stay calm, ma'am. Tommy. Oh, honey. What the f*ck you doing here? Sweetheart. These feds show up at my door and tell me you're locked up. What the hell is happening? An obvious manipulation. Whoa, whoa. The woman wanted to see her son. It's still America. Right. Get the f*ck outta here. Go home. Look, whatever they think you did, you gotta tell them what they wanna know. Okay, all right. My client would like a moment alone with his mother, so... Greg : Oh. Yeah. [ chuckles ] Greg : Of course. Tommy. Be good. She looks even more coked up now than she did when we were in high school. Oh, yeah. Yeah, she was definitely chewing the invisible sandwich all the way over from Babylon. With a woman like that for a mother he never had a chance. Saxe : Yeah, every criminal has a sob story. Don't get soft on us now, Angela. We're gonna nail this sucker to the wall. Honey, they said they're gonna take the house. Everything you gave me, they're gonna take it all. They're just saying that sh1t to f*ck with your head. No, they meant it. They're gonna take everything. They can do that, can't they? Yes, they can, if they determine you bought the house with money from illegal proceeds. Oh, so I'm totally f*cked, then! No, Ma, would you shut... [ silent ] [ audio resumes ] Oops. That's illegal. What? It was an honest mistake, Greg. Sandoval : Two seconds. Just to see if we're making some headway. Mother : Even if it means I lose every goddamn thing I own? God, you never loved me. You monster. You'd throw your own mother over  for some asshole you barely know. If it means saving both our lives, yeah, I f*ckin' will! Right. Would you shut the f*ck up and listen to me for a second? I hate the way you... Shut up. Shut the f*ck up, you f*ckin' ditzy bitch. If you don't know nothin' about me, you should know this. I ain't never gonna be no f*ckin' snitch. Not for you, not for nobody. You f*cking pig. You're an asshole! Let's go take a break, calm down a little bit, - get some water... [ audio cuts out ] We don't need his testimony to convict Lobos. Yeah, but it would've been nice. Too bad, Tommy Egan. Enjoy being in prison for the rest of your life. [ knock on door ] Hey, come in. You were right about Tommy. He won't break. You talked to him? No, my boss did, my... my colleagues. They tried everything. I didn't want you to get him to testify against this Lobos guy. I told you that wasn't gonna work. Angie, you gotta... you gotta figure out another way. I can try talking to his lawyer about a deal, a confession, or shorter sentence, but I'm not sure my boss will sign off. And the truth is... I don't think he deserves it. He was in that room with Lobos, and he is a major drug dealer. And sometimes people deserve to pay the price. I think you want me to protect someone who legally, morally, fundamentally doesn't deserve protection. [ sighs ] I think we should stop talking about this tonight. We can't play this game forever. This is the only thing I can think about. Hey. The only thing? Why, Jamie? Angie, stop. I need to know why. Please, stop. I can't. I need to ask you. I need to know. [ sighs ] Why ask a question when you don't want the answer? [ distant siren wailing ] Tommy's gonna go to prison eventually, Jamie. There's consequences to our actions, Angie. For all of us. We're running out of time, aren't we? I hope not. But that's up to you. [ door opens, closes ] Proctor? Yeah. We need to talk. [ buzzer sounds ] [ door opens ] [ keys jingle ] Egan, on the gate. No sunbathing for me today. Maybe tomorrow. Guard : Let's go. Where the hell we goin'? Hey, m*therf*cker, I said, "Where the hell we goin'?" Just keep moving. Have a seat, Tommy. You gonna take off these cuffs? No. I ain't see no cameras in here. No mics. And I don't see my lawyer. Nope, just you and me in here. So no reason not to talk. I want to help you. Help me? That's funny. [ laughs ] That's f*ckin' hilarious. You hate my guts. You always have. Jamie asked me to help you. That's why we're in here. So you are workin' together. I f*ckin' knew it. No, I want you to go to prison for the rest of your life. He doesn't. But he doesn't get that the only way I can help you is if you testify against Lobos. If it's reprisal, revenge you're worried about, I can get you witness protection. I can even relocate your mother. The government doesn't want you. They want Lobos. Maybe I can get your sentence down to 15 years. 15 years, you... [ bangs table ] Bitch! Your pussy must be made out of poison. It's like the acid ate his f*cking brain. You ruined him first, you f*ckin' asshole. You want me to snitch so bad. I ain't gonna give you Lobos, but I can think of someone else I can give you instead. Huh? Nah? You don't want that, do you? That don't work with you and Jamie's little plan. Tommy, Jamie and I don't have a plan. Sure. That's what I'll tell the judge. He paid for my lawyer, you know. He wants me to trust that guy to save me. But maybe I should f*cking save myself. Jamie wouldn't hurt you. Are you so sure about that, Angie? Are you sure you know him that well? - [ pounds on door ] [ door opens ] Sorry, Miss Valdes. His lawyer's here. [ soft chatter ] Proctor, I need to talk to you. I want to tell the judge something. No. No, no, no. Not now. It's about the... Just keep your mouth shut. Trust me, don't say a word, okay? Defense counsel has filed a motion to dismiss the complaint against the defendant, Thomas Patrick Egan. This better be good, Mr. Proctor. Your Honor, the defense would like to ask the court to suppress the government's identification of my client as the New York distributor for defendant Lobos' alleged drug network and any related testimony or evidence. We submit that the partial sketch attributed to witness statements from Nomar Arcielo and described in the affidavit  as the primary evidence used to identify Mr. Egan was not, in fact, the sketch used in said ID. Judge Lefevre : What am I looking at, Counselor? Proctor : We believe that the identification for Mr. Egan completed by Isabel Ruiz, the 14-year-old daughter of Carlos Ruiz, A sketch obtained from a 14-year-old  in, no doubt, an environment of duress and undue influence from an overzealous AUSA. That's why they left it out of evidence. It is your belief that the completed sketch was withheld in order to deceive the court? That's a very serious charge, Mr. Proctor. Your Honor, the partial sketch was sufficient to identify the defendant and properly presented in the affidavit on that basis. We don't recognize this completed sketch, but I'm sure its lack of inclusion in discovery was a simple clerical error. Excuse my tone, Your Honor, but that would be a pretty convenient clerical error. I agree. [ people murmuring ] The government's exclusion of the full sketch and the likelihood that it and not the partial sketch  led to the ID of Mr. Egan as your suspect... [ scoffs ] It's hard to ignore. Your Honor, putting aside the issue of the sketch for a moment, the plain fact is defendant Egan was still arrested in that hotel room with Felipe Lobos in plain violation of numerous federal laws. Even so, Your Honor, if the sketch is dirty, then every subsequent piece of evidence, every government action against Mr. Egan,  including the tail leading to his arrest in said hotel room is fruit of the same poisonous tree. [ people whispering ] I hereby exclude the government's identification of Thomas Patrick Egan. The ID is out. And without a solid ID, the government lacks probable cause Your Honor, in the interest of justice... We request you dismiss with prejudice, Your Honor. Prosecutorial malfeasance of this kind deserves sanctions, and my client should be able to walk away free knowing the government cannot retaliate. I agree. The complaint is hereby dismissed with prejudice. Someone on your staff needs a disciplinary hearing, Miss Valdes. Mr. Egan, you're free to go. Marshals, escort him back to MCC for processing out of the system. [ gavel bangs ] Thank you, Your Honor. [ door opens ] How could you do this to me, Jamie? I could lose my f*cking job! You didn't think I was gonna let Tommy rot in prison, did you? Yeah, all that crap about getting me to help him? That was all bullshit to keep me distracted so I'd never see this coming. No, Angela. It wasn't bullshit. If you had figured out a way to help him, I wouldn't have had to do this at all. You'll do anything, won't you? Say anything to get what you want. Won't you? Come on, we're just alike, Angela. Don't get all new on me like you been playin' fair. You stole that sketch from my apartment. And you cloned my phone and followed me to the hotel. If I was in that room with Tommy, I'd be in custody right now. You knew I was following you. I played right into your hand. And I gave you Lobos for your troubles! But you can't have Tommy. We've both been playing dirty, Angie. You're just mad you lost. Now I'm gonna get my club back from Stern, and then everything we wanted since we were in high school is there for us to take. You said all along that what you wanted was a life with me. I wanted a life with Jamie. This, you... you're not Jamie anymore. Time's up. Say it to my face. Say it to my face so that I can never deny it to myself again. Are you Ghost? If I were Ghost, would I answer that question? Why does it matter? Huh? There's nothing stoppin' us. Nothing anymore, baby. Not Tasha, not the case. Everything that's in the past can stay in the past. Stop playing games. It's over. No, that's the lawyer talking. What do you want? I know you want me. I know you want us. I've been this guy all along. If you love me, this is who you loved. I loved you because I thought you were different. Special. I thought you were like me, trying to find a way out from where you came from. This... this club, this dream, that's what I loved. That hasn't changed. It's still there. Bullshit. It's all smoke and mirrors. Remember what you said to me? You sell people a fantasy. That's all that you are, a fantasy. f*ck you, Ghost.

Thank you for coming. Thank you so much for having us. Thank you, man. You like that? Great timepiece. Y'all be good. Good guy. [ chatter continues ] Dominque, make sure you take care of Hamilton. Thank you. Bartender : What's up, boss? You got it. How we lookin'? Killin' it, man. But we're running out of the good stuff. Just gonna run in the back and grab 'em. Nah, I'll take care of it. You keep slingin'. Make these people happy. All right. Be back in a minute. [ sighs ] [ humming ] [ gun hammer clicks ] Shawn : Don't move. Drop the keys. [ keys clink ] You picked a hell of a night for this, Shawn. I would ask why, but I got a feeling I already know. Kanan. Shut up. What's the plan here, Shawn? Huh? I know you ain't got a change of clothes. And what they don't show you in the movies is that when you shoot somebody this close, there's blowback. You shoot me, blood spatters all over your shirt, you run outta here, people will notice. Shut up. You ain't gonna talk your way outta this, Ghost. You ain't gonna talk me out of it. My dad told me that you sent him to jail. That you set him up. I ain't gonna lie to you. It's true. Back then, I had big plans. Big plans that Kanan couldn't see. So it was either set him up for him to go away or it was... or it was me killing him. I wasn't gonna kill him. When my pops died, your dad was there for me, man. I looked up to Kanan. Hell, I needed him. At one point in my life, I loved your pops very much. Love? What do you know about love, hmm? You loved my dad, but you set him up. You love Tasha, but you been cheating on her for f*ckin' I don't know how long. She deserves better than you. She deserves... She deserves what? What, Shawn, you? Yeah, me! Fucker. While you was out f*ckin' around with Angela, I had Tasha's back. I held it down when you forgot all about her. You know, you keep sayin' that we just alike, but we're not. When I say something, I mean it. When I say I'm gonna do something, I f*ckin' do it. Yeah, you right. Everything you f*ckin' said is right. You are not like me. You ain't built for this. I always known it. I think you have as well. But what Kanan's asking you to do, Shawn... no real father... should ever ask of their son. Kanan and I chose our path. By puttin' that gun in your hand, he's trying to choose yours for you. But I could get it back, though. You shut up. Drop the gun. I said shut up! I got the f*ckin' gun now. Now I got it, bitch. Now I f*ckin' got it, f*ck nigga. I deserve this. Yeah, you f*ckin' deserve it. Not just for trying to kill me, Shawn, but for whatever it is you got goin' on with my wife. [ coughing ] That's why you gotta go. You're not cut out for this. I want you to leave. Not just Truth. I want you to leave New York. Get up. Go be a better man than Kanan, not the man he's trying to turn you into. Go. Uncle G, I'm... Go! [ door opens, closes ] [ door opens ] [ sighs ] Greg, please, you can yell at me tomorrow. No, we're gonna do this now. I just... I think I finally figured it all out. What are you talking about? Well, I've been... I've been watching Egan, right? And Lobos wouldn't trust that guy to run an organization this complex. But you know who I would trust? I think James St. Patrick is Ghost... and I think you have been working with him to protect Tommy Egan. Why would you think that? I saw you together outside your apartment a few weeks ago. Hold on. And you saw him at his club tonight. You've been following me. Yes. Oh, absolutely, Angela. And it's a good thing that I have, because now, finally, I can get to the truth of it all. And it's... it's... it all makes sense. The tip that you got from St. Patrick about the Lobos meet,  that's all part of the plan. We put all of our attention on arresting Egan while you and Jamie work with Proctor to get him out. Who else would have known about the sketch, Angela? I don't... it's up to Collins God damn it, Angela. You're right. But not about me. I went by his club tonight and confronted him. He didn't deny being involved. I've been looking into James for some time now. I kept it to myself because I didn't want you out on a limb backing me if all this was bullshit. And the tip? Part of his plan. I thought he was a good man. But I was wrong. He played me just like you said. And that's why you were crying when you left the club? I'm an idiot. I thought he and I were... friends. All right, I can get this information to Mike and Collins tonight. We can get St. Patrick before he moves on  and, uh, we can have him testify against Lobos  if we got him dead to rights, yeah? Right. Right? Good. But I'm not sure we have enough for a warrant. I mean, enough for it to stick. Maybe hindering prosecution, maybe, but not enough for the drug charges. Not enough to prove that he's Ghost. I think we should build a case against him tonight. Sit down together, see what we have. Go to Mike tomorrow. Okay. Okay, Angela. Yeah, let's do that. Ahem. Tomorrow morning. Together. All right. Tell me everything you've got on James St. Patrick. We're gonna take him down. [ gate clangs ] You look like a movie star. Get the f*ck in the car. It's good to have you back, brother. You came through for me. Of course I did. Get the f*ck out of here. You didn't doubt me, did you? Well, to be honest, you had your boy worried there for a minute. I was getting it from all angles the whole time. Feds can be persuasive. Yeah, but you held it down, Tommy. Of f*cking course. You should have seen that bitch Angela's face when the case got tossed. [ laughs ] It was f*cking priceless. [ laughs ] So what do we do now? We got to get back to work. Yeah, but let's save it for tomorrow. For now, how about we get you some decent food? Oh, hell, yeah.

I can tell from your clean, pretty suit you failed me again. Yeah, well, I didn't want to disappoint you, Dad. It turns out, the only person disappointed was me. Is it true? Is what true? Have you been using me this whole time to get revenge on Ghost? [ laughs ] That slick m*therf*cker, man. He flipped you. You right, Shawn. You got me. Whatever he said, it's the truth. Now you know. Now I know. You're right, I know. I know you a piece of sh1t. I know Ghost was right to put you in jail 'cause that's where you belong. You're not my father. You never have been. You're just a bitter old thug. Ain't nothing more for you but the streets. Where you going, kid? I'm taking Tasha and the kids and I'm getting the f*ck out of here. [ groans ] I knew you couldn't kill Ghost 'cause you're weak. Dad! And if Ghost wasn't so weak, he would have killed you his motherfucking self. Dad! You stupid little nigga. Look, you done f*cked up. Now you done made me f*ck up. Get the f*cking phone out your hand. Who you trying to call? You trying to call 911? You a rat? No. Who you trying to call? Trying to call Mommy? Hmm? You wanna call Uncle G? Go on, call him. Well, that's the only way it go, right? Nigga never there when you need him. [ groaning ] But you right about one thing.
