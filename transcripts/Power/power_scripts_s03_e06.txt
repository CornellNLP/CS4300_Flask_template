 Ghost : Previously on  Power... 
 I'd be glad to have you on the team. 
 It's only temporary until Milan is ready to move again. 
 [Gunshot] 
 You give me the identity of Ghost, and you and I will never have to see each other again. 
 Transfer papers for Ruiz? 
 No, Felipe Lobos. 
 Thomas, I will be able to spread my wings again, but before that happens, I need your help opening the cage. 
 What did you do? 
 The Jamaicans. 
 No! 
 You didn't do it. 
 So I hired them myself. 
 Man : Who's the target? 
 Holly : James St. Patrick. [gunshot] James, go. We got this. [Yells] What happened? It was Holly. Lobos hired me to kill you,  said he'd do her... Her and me if I didn't, but I still didn't do it. We got to kill Lobos... together. Together. Joe : ♪ They say this is a big, rich town ♪

Grab the keys, brother. Come on, buddy. I got you. Get the keys. Tommy, you just had them downstairs, man. I know that I got them somewhere. Check your pant pocket. Come on. Let's get you cleaned up. I'll put a pot of coffee on. We got work to do. Come on, buddy. We should be transporting Lobos in an armored tank. The Jimenez have shown they're not afraid to strike on U.S. territory, so what's to stop them now? Jerry, the Jimenez think Lobos is dead. Hardly anyone outside of this room knows he's alive. A large transport will only call attention to itself. So what's the other option? We stay off the main roads, keep the move as quiet and inconspicuous as possible. Is there a civilian vehicle we could use? A civilian vehicle? Yeah, the Bureau of Prisons has an undercover van modified for prisoner transport. The rear conceals the prisoner and our personnel. Lobos exits our facility confidentially. He wears a GPS tracker the entire operation. So we would know where he is at all times? Yeah, we can track him from this office. How's that sit with you, Donovan? If we're doing this low-key, I need men I know I can trust on the ground. No offense. Agent Knox, get the fellows ready. I want you to run point. Yes, sir. I'll handle it. Then it's settled. Let's get started. I handled the coordination with Anglin's people at the BOP and the FBI. Everyone will monitor the transfer from our conference room. In a way, I can't believe it. The task force is almost over. We transfer Lobos to D.C., and this is all behind us, right? All behind us. Hugo's got a crew I'ma hook up with, and I don't know how many guys. He's not what you'd call a communicator. So you link up with Hugo's crew as planned. I'll help ambush them, take over the prison break. Lobos won't know what hit him. Yeah, well, we got to be off the grid all day. I mean, Kate'll lie for me in exchange for enough coke. What you gonna do about an alibi? I hear you're living with Angela now. Karen. I could use Karen. You already got a side bitch on your side bitch? No, Tommy, Karen's an investor. She's got a property up on the Hudson. If I stay there overnight, then I can just tell Angela I was away on a business trip. Perfect. Nothing suspicious about Lobos going missing on the exact day you happen to be out of town. Tommy, you listening? Angela will believe me. You're so f*cking sure about that. [Pounding on door] One second. What's up, Tasha? You good? Tasha : What's up? I'm good. And where the hell is Holly? I've been texting your girl all morning. What the... Hey, T. I thought you two weren't talking. We worked some sh1t out. Mm-hmm. Overnight. Yeah. What the hell is going on? Thing is, we got to do something real big, T. Yo, yo, yo. Tommy, we don't need to involve her. You got a better idea? We need her, Ghost. Need me for what? Hey, Dean. How's Tariq? Tariq's fine. Three men were killed right in front of you. He didn't see any of it. Look, I appreciate what you did. I really do, but I gave you explicit instructions not to follow me. Well, I had a hunch, and it paid off. You and your son are alive because of it. And I appreciate it, once again. Whoever tried to kill you won't stop because we thwarted one attempt. Now, you know who it was, and you know why they tried to hurt you. If it happens again, I won't have a choice. I'll have to go to the authorities. It won't happen again. So you plan to handle it on your own? Listen, Dean. My plan is to not share my plan with you. Do not follow me again. Clear? Sir, sorry to interrupt. Uh, Karen Bassett's here to see you. It's all good. We're done here. Hello, James. Hey, Karen. Thanks for coming in. Pleasure. What did you want to talk about? Um, I just wanted to ask you if you were willing to move our special meeting tomorrow to, uh, the Odette on the Hudson. Okay. I just thought maybe I could spend the night, learn the Bassett experience from the inside out, you know? Understand your system and the way it works and... I don't know, while I finalize my ideas. You're taking this seriously. I have to. I'm always looking towards the future. Aren't you? No phones. We're f*cked if we got phones. You know they can track that sh1t even if it's off. Okay, we ditch the phones for the day. I'm surprised that you could be disconnected from the club for that long. Uh, Tommy, can you please use this before you slice your hand open? You know what? Why don't I use this before I slice my hand? That sh1t works. Mm. Get out of here. So Kate's gonna be his alibi? Why not Holly? Holly's a bad idea, Tash. Tasha : What happened? They break up? She told him about the baby. He f*cked it up, right? That's why he called you. He didn't say much. He didn't want to talk about it. She's definitely not gonna keep it now. I feel bad. I told her to tell him. No wonder she's not texting me back. Ghost : Look, Tash, can he crash here tonight? If he leaves, I'm afraid we're gonna find him toasting to the sunrise at O'Malley's, you know this. All right? Thank you. I got to go. Running late. Angela expecting you? Part of the plan, Tasha. All part of the plan. Good night, T. Good night, Tommy. Good night, Ghost. Hey, Tash, got any more food? Usual sh1t, Ghost! Leaving me with the mess. Tommy : Tasha. Hey. Hey. Going somewhere? Remember that pitch meeting I had with Karen Bassett? Well, she invited me to spend tomorrow night at her hotel so I could learn the lay of the land. Spend the night for a pitch meeting? [laughs] You should come. I would love to. But not tomorrow. I've got a big day at work, and that is all I can say. Okay. Well, I'll say this. When the deal happens with Karen Bassett... And it will... You and I, Miss Thing, we're gonna be jet-setting all over this big wide world. London, Paris, even Tokyo. You know what? Hmm. I'll let you be my general counsel. That's a completely different kind of law, Jamie. [laughs] But you gonna learn. Am I? Uh-huh. You're gonna learn that we're gonna be in the clubs at night. We're gonna be sleeping during the day. And in between... Oh, right, like we would ever take a break to sleep. [Falling by Opia] Opia : ♪ Classic twist ♪

Typical Ghost. Your black ass had to go and put a damper on it, huh? [Speaking Spanish] _ How the f*ck am I supposed to work with these two morons if they don't speak English? I talk English. School of Americas. So you brought me two thugs that torture farmers. Tell me, Hugo, what's the plan? Tommy, the transport will be most vulnerable... here at the bend in the road. [Clattering] What the f*ck's he doing? The GPS. 'Cause that explains it. Let's just get this over with. Heads up, boys. Here we go. Nice to see you again. I know you. Where's his tracker? Left ankle. I wanted white, but they said it wasn't available. Hey, it was. You probably checked online, right? Here you go. Watch your head. Confirm we have Lobos on the move. Copy that, Agent Knox.

James has said so much about you. Call me Karen. I just wanted to come by and make sure that everything was in order. Oh, it's fantastic. You pulled out all the stops. It's nice to, um, have a night away from the kids. James is in the shower. Do you want him to call when he's out? No. No, I'll talk to him in the morning. Please, with our compliments. Thank you. Come on in. Thank you. Hmm. Coming. Go. Oh, how lucky am I, huh? No, luck had nothing to do with it. No? Nope. I requested this here seat. Easy. Will you massage my calves? I just don't get it. Is it really that easy? What? What? One primera flips, and you fall down like a domino? Damn. I pity you. I really pity you. Really? I pity you. They'll be putting you away for a very, very long time and your old friend Ruiz, James St. Patrick. Never heard of him. I'm so bored. Me too. [Dramatic music] ♪ ♪ We got a situation here!

Where are you going? Chill, B. We just got to ditch the eye in the sky. This is not the plan. I call Hugo. That's odd. So's this. Did you really think that I didn't know that you was just gonna drop me when this was all over? Ghost : Hola, Jefe. Seriously, bitch, ain't you got a job? Hmm. "Love you, Angie." Yes, hello. I need a shoeshine for my husband. He's sleeping. I'd like it back in about 20 minutes, before he wakes up. Okay, great. Damn it, Ghost. Out. How'd you seduce him away from me? The dog always goes back to the master, eh? Unless you cut the dog's f*cking throat. Ah! Ghost : Tommy! Tommy! Tommy, come on, man. You should've seen what his f*cking goon did to Bell. He's still got to f*cking walk, huh? Let's get him up. Come on. You think you're gonna f*cking kill me and live to talk about it? I'm gonna erase your f*cking bloodline. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Make you extinct! [Knock at door] Hey. You all right? Fine. Just worried about Greg, like we all are. I'm surprised you're this worked up, Valdes. You guys had some serious beef. That doesn't mean I wanted this to happen to him. I just wish I could tell him I was sorry. 
 
 [Gentle music] What the hell is that? Man : Greg's okay! What? Thank God you were wearing a vest. Take it easy, huh? It's fine. Oh, thank God. Let's take a walk. Come on. Take it easy. Come on. Lobos : He's gonna betray you, you know. There's still time. Tommy : Shut your f*cking mouth. Lobos : And this plan, walking me through this muck, you're leaving evidence everywhere. One of you's gonna get caught, don't you think? Not gonna betray you? He's done it once before. He's betrayed both of us. I know why you want out, Fantasma, but now you have to make a choice. Tommy, do you think he's gonna choose you? Well, he ain't choosing you. ♪ Love is a wonderful thing ♪ And she's lovely, Fantasma, like an angel. Well, her name is Angela. She's beautiful, independent, brave. And I heard she's got a tight little pussy. What about her? Come on, Ghost. We ain't there yet. Huh? Mm, what do you think? I organized my escape. I know every detail of the government's plan to move me. Yeah, we know you got a f*cking rat on the inside. Mm-hmm, and when my "rat" on the inside realizes that I haven't made it to my destination, he's gonna get Angela's beautiful brown eyes, you know? He's gonna come out, and he's gonna scoop them out and f*ck it. Call it off. Tommy : No, are you serious? Mm-mm. No, no, no. Not until I'm free; until then, the clock goes "tick-tock, tick-tock, tick-tock." He's gonna f*cking kill Angela, man. Which you should've done yourself before now. f*ck you. We gone too far. We gonna waste this m*therf*cker and bury him so deep, no one'll ever find him. Hey, Tommy, why so brash? You think I'm foolish enough to trust you blindly? Hugo's with your beautiful little delicate white flower right now. Holly? You talking about Holly? Mm-hmm. Oh, and she's... She's gonna suffer. March. And then they were, um... They were ready for it. They knew every detail about the transfer... everything. Mike : What are you basing that on? This feels like a smash and grab. No. I don't need a doctor. No, no, no. I had a vest on. Everything's fine. You took two to the chest, and you refuse to go to the hospital. He's gonna look you over. That's an order. I'm gonna need you to unbutton your shirt. What? Unbutton your shirt, please. f*ck. After I got popped, they went straight... Deep breath, please. Deep breath again. After I got popped, they went straight for Lobos's GPS tracker, rolled up with f*cking bolt cutters, ready for it, which means we've got a big f*cking leak. GPS trackers are standard operating procedure with high-value prisoners. They were likely prepared for it just in case. Right, Mike, they... but they knew exactly what van to hit, what route... stop, man... Okay, okay. What time. Which means this was a f*cking inside job. You're very lucky. - Mm-hmm. I'm gonna need an MRI. They were right in front of my eyes, man. Right in front of me. Okay. We need to lock down this office... Mike : We're in the middle of a clusterfuck as it is. The last thing our department needs is a wild, unformulated accusation about a leak. Main Justice would shit-can every last one of us. You were just in a firefight. Your adrenaline's pumping. Mike's right. Right now, we need to be rational until we know more. First order of business: find Lobos. [Phones buzzing] They found the getaway car and a second body. I'll be right back. I'm glad you're okay. We were all worried that you were, uh, gone. Good to have you back, Greg. [Phone buzzing] Okay. f*ck. Is this for me? Yeah, it's all for you. I don't like these accommodations. Really? No. I never had any complaints before. Turn around, Jefe. Sorry you don't get to paint your watercolors. No acuarelas para ti, Jefe. Mm. Fantasma. Killing me doesn't save you. One day, you will find yourself standing right here. God doesn't take men like us peacefully while we sleep. Tommy : And this is where your life ends. Nighty-night, Jefe. [Phone buzzing] What the f*ck? Is that a phone? Ghost, we said no phones! I don't have a f*cking phone. We'll check his coat. Yeah, I checked him for trackers. Well, f*cking check him again. Come on, Tommy. [Phone line trilling] [Lobos laughing] f*ck. Smash it. f*ck! Smash it! Who was it? Who was it? How am I supposed to know? He destroyed it, eh? Whoever has the number could be f*cking triangulating the cell tower now, man. And they could trace us here? Mm-hmm. Well, that f*cks the plan. Come on. We got to abort. No, no, no, no. No, no. We go forward. What is the point of being here if they're sending a search party? I could've done him back on the highway. No. We take him somewhere else, and we Bin Laden his ass. We toss him in the ocean so he's gone forever. You f*cking said it. You said, "We can't put a f*cking fugitive in the back seat of a f*cking Ford driving like we going to picnic!" Come on, man, we put a f*cking bullet in his brain. Think! I am thinking, and that phone f*cks us good. God damn it! [Dramatic music] f*ck. ♪ ♪ Hey, Jack, it's Mike Sandoval. I need to call in a trap-and-trace to a cell's last known tower number. Tommy : You think he made it to the highway? Ghost : How would he know which way to go? All right, just slip back in the neighborhood, partner. If we gonna find this b*st*rd, we got to split up. Yeah, you're right. I'm gonna take this trail over here. You keep going down the path. [Tense music] ♪ ♪ [grunts] Ghost! Ghost, where the f*ck are you? Don't do it. I'm not surprised. I would do the same. We leave a body, there's gonna be a shitstorm. I need to end this now, Tommy. Okay, I guess we're not negotiating this. You want to bury him? Carry his body back? No. We'll let the vultures have at him. Let's get out of here, brother. What are you gonna do about your nosey security guard, Dean? I need to get rid of him. I mean, I don't want to kill him, but I... Why not? Well, I might still need the m*therf*cker. We're finally free, Tommy. We're finally f*cking free, man. Me and you, man, we got our whole lives back. Yeah. You get to start over. Start over? With what, Ghost? Nigga, I ain't got no connect. I ain't got no family. I ain't got no... Hey, man, you'll meet a new girl, you know? Better yet, another lucky girl will meet you. Can't replace Holly. Come on. Man, we made a lot of money. You can do anything you want to do. It's only one part of our lives that's over, Tommy. We got our whole life ahead of us. Yeah? Yeah. And about Holly, man. I'm sorry. Sure. [Music playing] [Exhales] Have a good run? Yes. And that's what I told the doorman. Mm. Well, I've been here, holding down my end of the bargain. Good. This bitch is hooked on you. She been texting all damn day. Damn, Tash, sounds just like me. Yeah, well I remember how you used to talk to me. I should probably call her. We don't usually go this long without talking. Mm-hmm, okay. Well, before you do, I just heard from Mama. Tariq tried to sneak out the house. When she caught him, he talked back to her. You want to know why? Because I'm not there. Because I ain't there. Lobos may be dead, but your sh1t is slipping, and it's taking me out at the knees. Tasha, he's just adjusting to the new situation, okay? That's all. The kid'll be fine. [Phone buzzing] God, I miss you. I miss you too. Everything okay? How was work? It was a rough day. What about you? This property is beautiful, baby. You should see it. Tasha : Hmm. Could be a big endeavor, riskiest thing I've ever done. Angela : When do you get home? Ghost : Tomorrow, hopefully with good news, so cross your fingers. Jamie, I love you. I love you too, Angie. Have a good night, all right, baby? Really, Tasha? Is it always that easy to lie to someone you love? Jesus. I'm doing what needs to be done, okay? It's part of the plan. It's always like that with you. What? Necessity. What needs to be done. Which is why I can't understand this. Our prenup says that I get half if you want out. You ready to lose half? 'Cause I'll take it all. That money's for the kids too. I would never back out on that. You know that. But what if you're in prison? You think killing Lobos is gonna make your dirt disappear? You think if she finds out you did this, she's gonna cover for you? I think she's not gonna find out. The only way she finds out is if you tell her, Tasha, and you're not gonna tell her; you know why? Because you're an accomplice. I already signed them, because I am so done with your ass. Tasha, this is what it looks like, uh, moving forward for us, all right? No more threats. Nobody coming after me, you, the kids. No more guns in the house or guards. I'm f*cking keeping the family safe. That's what I'm doing, and some day, you're gonna appreciate it. Oh, I appreciate it. Uh-uh. Don't even try it. And I want my own car for the trip home tomorrow. Good night. Mm-hmm. [Siren wailing in the distance] Hey, hey, hey. I brought you your ring. Look at that. Hello. You're expected. James. Karen. Tasha, hello. Tasha : Hi, how are you? This is my father. It's an honor, Mr. Bassett. I have a tremendous amount of respect for your empire. No, call me Horatio. From what I hear, you're well on your way to building your own. We try. Speaking of "we," this is my lovely wife, Tasha. Hi, how are you? It's a pleasure to meet you, sir. Tasha, are you joining us for brunch? I'm so flattered, but no, I... I need to get home and be with the kids. But the hotel was wonderful. Thank you, really. Have a good meeting. Good luck, James. Give me a second. Mm-hmm. All right, but get home safe, okay? Good-bye, Ghost. Someone in this office gave us up. Or someone in the BOP. Nope. Or Lobos himself. I mean, you know how common burner phones are inside. [Clears throat] f*ck. Please, please tell me this isn't about Valdes. Who else would it be? [Chuckles] We were, um, all pretty shaken up when we thought you bought it. Oh, Jesus, thanks. That's sweet, Saxe. Uh, shut up. Like I said, we were all spooked, but Valdes was practically crying like a... human woman. For effect. Mm, looked pretty real to me. You guys back in the sack? No. Well, then, now that you're wounded, I'm thinking you might be able to get back in there. Like a Purple Heart, but you know, pussy. [Knocks] Ah. Hey. Dean, thanks for coming in. Pleasure. Look, I called you down to let you know that I no longer need your services. In my experience, when you save the life of a man and that of his son, they keep you close. What's different about this situation? I don't have to explain myself to you, first of all. You finally killed Lobos. What'd you say? What language is that? Wait, how do you know the code? You have many questions. And tell me, which is right question to begin with? Who the f*ck do you think you are? Wrong. Who are you, and do I know? [With Serbian accent] Yes, I do, Jamie St. Patrick. Look, Ghost. I know who you are. Club owner, father, adulterer, drug dealer, thief. Did you get my message? Do you know what you have taken from me? You're Serbian, and this has to do with Vladimir and his crew. And the shipment that you and Tommy intercepted and left for the police, my drugs. Sit. Milan. Nice to meet you. And all this time, you were working for me. You were so concerned with Lobos that you neglected me. It's very selfish. You took from me what was mine. You owe me, Ghost. You got close to me. You hired your f*cking men to protect me, but you're not gonna kill me. 'Cause you have value, you and Tommy, and I need you to go to work for me to replace what you have stolen. Why now, Milan, huh? I got nothing left. I got no network. I got no supplies. I'm out of the f*cking game. I know how you think. You will stall and deal with me like you did Lobos, but first remember my security team is in your clubs. We know your home, your family, Angela. You can kill me, but it is of no consequence, 'cause I am not Lobos, and my organization does not die with me. Call Tommy and tell him it's time to go back to work. Do not worry. You are very safe. For now. I did hear you say Milan, right? The m*therf*cker who eats people? For sure? Yo, he's been working for you this whole time? f*ck, Ghost, where's your head at? It was seamless, man. He didn't miss a f*cking beat. And we just took out one sicko yesterday. I'm not emotionally prepared to work for another psychopath. Okay, brother, look, I hear you. That's why we f*cking need to kill him. Kill him? Yeah, kill him. You want to kill Milan? You know anything about him or his crew? No. How about his turf, his organization? No. f*ck. I mean, he's been working for you for this long? I bet you don't even know what kind of car he drives. Tommy, we are lucky to be alive, man. We're sitting here f*cking talking, and the only reason we're not dead is because he needs us. No, you are lucky. I'm not the m*therf*cker that killed Vladimir. f*ck Vladimir. He don't give a f*ck about Vladimir. He told me himself. Listen to me, man. He's talking about his shipment, all right? That m*therf*cker said we're going back to work for him to pay him back. You want to get back to hustling? I have to. How exactly are you planning on pulling it off living with a fed? You're gonna have to wake up with her every morning... and lie to her, lie to her all God damn day, lie to her every night. It's never gonna f*cking work. So you're saying I can't pull it off? No, she took you back because she thought that you was clean. As soon as she finds out that you got back in the game, she gonna turn you in. No, she won't. No, but that's not even your big f*cking problem. Your big f*cking problem is that she's your soft spot. She's your weakness. They can go on after her to get to you. Dean knows everything about me. Milan. He knows everything about me, which means he can get to my family, Tommy. He can make Tasha and the kids f*cking target practice. Yeah, well, Tasha got a head on a swivel. She a motherfucking G. She got your kids on lock. Now, but Angela, she's a liability. You can't even tell her that the Serbians are after her. Now, I think that we should've killed that bitch a long time ago, but we didn't, so here we are. She either catches you, puts you in jail, or she don't but Milan catches her. Yeah. But if you take her out, you could make sure that she don't suffer. 'Cause if Milan gets a hold of her... I can't believe I'm saying this. But if everything that Vladimir told me about Milan is true, my God. Even I don't think Angela deserves that. I'll handle it. I'll be here when you get back. Finally, you're home. Hey, baby. How was your day? Okay. You don't seem okay, and I'm certainly not okay. Tell me about that... you know, that part of the future where we fly around the world. That'll make us feel better. Jamie, what's wrong? Our future together flying around the world, it's not gonna happen, baby. Something went wrong with Karen? Something's wrong. Been wrong. I was just too out of it to see. You know, Angie, yesterday Tariq ran away. He's back now, but I wasn't there. At some point, my kids have to be what's most important. As they should be. Jamie, I've never asked you to choose between your kids and me. What are you saying? You know what I'm saying. You separated from Tasha. I saw the papers. And now I know that was a mistake. A mistake? You love me. I know you do. You told me so. And... and I meant it, you know? When I said it, I meant it. I wanted to love you. I wanted to dream. Why are you doing this? But that was our 15-year-old dream. Maybe we've outgrown that dream. Now, you love me, this me standing here right now asking you? Not the version of me you put together in your head 20 years ago but this me. You love this me? Yes, I love you. You know that. Tariq running away means that all of a sudden, our feelings for each other aren't real? This doesn't make sense. Tariq running away made me realize what I have to lose, okay, in the real world, not in a fantasy world. Angela, do you really trust your 15-year-old self to make decisions for the rest of your life? I trust the way I feel about you, the way I've always felt about you. Everything I've done for you, I've done for us, and I would do it again. Angie, if we were meant to be together, you think it would be this hard? I came into the club, didn't I? Wasn't that meant to be? It's the right decision, okay? Obviously, you don't see that now, but I know one day you will. Take care of yourself. There's something you're not telling me. What do you want me to tell you? The truth. Tell me the truth. We can't be together, Angie. It's the right decision. Jamie, I love you. I know. Good-bye, Angie Valdes. [Angie sobbing] [gentle guitar music] ♪ ♪
