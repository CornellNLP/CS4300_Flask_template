The good thing is that it's cash, which makes it untraceable. Exactly. We're gonna use this dirty cash to buy hair in bulk at a wholesale price, then sell it to other salons at double what we paid for it, but money coming from other salons is clean. How do you know the other salons will buy from you? They won't have a choice, sweetie. Our prices'll be lower than anything on the streets. We dummy the receipts, make it look like the money was coming from my initial investment. Looks like Tommy and I sold out the wash-and-folds and went into hair for a living. Which is what we did. Right. I mean, from there, it's just about generating enough receipts to keep up with the amount of cash coming in. Which is what you'll teach me how to do. Yeah, and to deal with the bank. I mean, we're fine now, since you just got product in the pipeline, but soon, we're gonna need to open up more salons to keep up with the cash. That's where LaKeisha comes in.

Why are you meeting with the toddlers across the street? Mutual friends. And they're hot right now. Hmm. I'm planning to refurbish an old apartment building, turn it into a luxe eco-hotel.

I'm gonna take the next few weeks to examine you and them individually, as well as the portfolios of your nightclubs. But I got to get to know you personally as well as professionally.

But I like niggas too. Obviously. What's that you're drinking? Texas tea. You want to try a little? It might make you feel better. That don't taste like no damn tea. It grows on you after a few sips.

Officer : Watch the road. Okay. [loudly singing karaoke in Korean] We got it on good authority that the drugs we gave you have been stepped on and turned to sh1t.

Uh, we both lose. I can't hear a word over this sh1t. Will someone go up there and pull this guy's f*cking plug? I have no knowledge of what you're talking about. I believe you, and you've been in the game a lot longer than me, so I ain't gonna tell you how to run your business, but who's ever doing this in your organization is actually withholding the extra cash they're making by selling this diluted product. [applause] If what you say is true, then this all occurred because you make a promise and you did not deliver.

Yeah, you got any more hushpuppies up in here?" [laughing] Is that supposed to be me? Tasha : Yeah. I don't f*cking sound like that. "I don't f*cking sound like that." I'm glad you two are getting along so well together while I'm busting my ass out here. We're getting sh1t set up, a'ight? Actually, we were busy getting pulled over. What? We handled it. What?

How are they doing with Ghost gone? Yo, look, baby, she don't want to talk about him. And you know what? Neither do I. You know what? Honestly, this whole situation has been a bit rough on all of us, but we're taking it day by day. I can't believe anyone would do this to their family.

Only problem is, the only other person who can confirm that St. Patrick is the distributor is Vibora Ruiz. Now... I was hoping maybe you could use some of your DEA contacts, help me find him?

I put my bag on the top shelf of the closet, and I closed the door. What was Tariq doing going through my things in the first place? He's a boy. That's what they do, Angela. They get into sh1t. But I... I don't have kids. You don't, do you? So I guess snooping through my sh1t is hereditary? The whole f*cking situation's been tough on everyone, so we should just step away.
