 What is with all the secrecy, Mr. Davenport? 
 Where are we? 
 You are on the 110th floor of Davenport Tower, the most technologically advanced skyscraper in the world. 
 And this... is your new home. 
 Whoa, check out that view. 
 Seriously, this place is amazing. 
 Not bad, huh? 
 This penthouse is where I spent my years as a bachelor. 
 Boy, if these walls could talk. 
 Actually, they can talk. 
 Walls off, walls off. 
 You know what? Let's go out onto the terrace. 
 I want to show you something. 
 This holographic emblem represents your new team. 
 Or as I like to call it, an elite force. 
 Cool. When do we get to meet the others? 
 Right now. 
 I used a 3D hologram wall. 
 Kaz, Skylar and Oliver have been standing there the entire time. 
 Five hours, to be exact. 
 Let's not forget the two hours we spent rehearsing how to stand. 
 Obviously, we needed three hours, because you're still not doing it right. 
 It's great to see you guys. 
 What are they doing here? 
 Mighty Med hospital was destroyed. 
 What? 
 This is all that's left of it. 
 Who would do something like that? 
 We don't know. 
 We lost a lot of superheroes that we cared about. 
 We're not gonna stop until we find whoever's responsible. 
 They wanted to use my technology to track the criminals, but I had a better idea. 
 To create one all-powerful team combining bionic heroes and superheroes. 
 Where are the superheroes? 
 You're looking at 'em. 
 Oh, yeah. Oliver and I have super powers. 
 What, did you fall into a vat of radioactive waste? 
 Wait, no. Don't tell me. 
 Bitten by a supernatural spider. 
 Don't be ridiculous. 
 When we were trying to stop my mother, also known as the evil villain Mr. Terror, from becoming the most powerful being on the planet, we made indirect contact with the Arcturian space rock, which gave us a variety of superhuman abilities. 
 A magic space rock. 
 And was that delivered by a bunch of little green men? 
 You do know that I'm from another planet, right? 
 I do now. 
 You're gonna have to excuse Chase. 
 If you can't explain it with science, it doesn't exist, kinda like his social life, or his sense of humor or his ability to have fun. 
 Come on, Bree, do you really expect me to believe that these two have... 
 But that... but the human body can't... 
 I'm watching you, fire boy. 
 So can you shoot fire, too? 
 No. Kaz has fire and heat powers, and I have water and ice. 
 But we can both do this. 
 Oliver, no! 
 (Sighs) Well, it was a good team while it lasted. 
 What the... 
 Wow, he's pretty good. 
 Wait for it. 
 (Screaming) 
 Sorry. Still working on the landings. 
 So how did you three manage to escape before Mighty Med was destroyed? 
 We were off capturing my mom. 
 I mean, yeah, she's an evil lunatic who will spend the rest of her life in prison, but if it weren't for her, we would've been killed. 
 So... silver lining. 
 You're an odd little man. 
 Not the first time I've heard that. 
 Okay, sleeping quarters are all set. 
 Guys on the right, girls on the left. 
 And the guy who made it all possible will be in the giant room at the end of the hall. 
 Stay out of my pool. 
 I'm just glad I finally get to share my room with a girl. 
 Me, too. Oh, but don't forget, I'm from another planet, so sometimes, I spit acid in my sleep. 
 Yeah? Well, that is an upgrade, compared to what comes out of my brothers. 
 Hey, Mr. Davenport, we gotta start searching for those guys who destroyed our friends. 
 Where's all that technology you promised us? 
 I'm so glad you asked. 
 Hyperlift open! 
 It's a voice-activated secret passage! 
 That is so awesome. 
 And it seems like such a fire hazard. 
 I used my hydraloop technology to create an elevator that will take you from the penthouse to below the earth's surface instantly. 
 Step inside and let me show you. 
 Oh, wait. Me first. 
 Oh, FYI, I tend to get sick on any ride that has a big... drop!! 
 Welcome to mission command. 
 And just like that, we're back in the basement. 
 This is your team's central nervous system. 
 This is where you'll train, plan missions, learn how things work before you touch them. 
 (Phone rings) 
 Excuse me. I have a very important Daven-call to take. 
 You can't just take it down here? 
 I could, but then I wouldn't get to ride the hyperlift again. 
 Whoo! 
 Okay, I'm just gonna say it. 
 I'm very uncomfortable with that guy heading up this operation. 
 All right, let's head out and start searching for the lowlifes who destroyed Mighty Med. 
 But we don't even know where to look. 
 We have to look somewhere. 
 We'll go city by city, starting here. 
 You guys take uptown, we'll take downtown. 
 Whoa, whoa, whoa. 
 We don't just go randomly looking for people. 
 We have to devise a plan first. 
 We just did. 
 Uptown, downtown. 
 I don't really know any other parts of town, so plan commenced. 
 Now it feels like home. 
 (Eerie whirring noise) 
 (Whirring noise continues) 
 Okay, the cyber desk is compiling a database of all the superheroes in the hospital that someone might've had a grudge against. 
 In the meantime, I still need to know more about you guys. 
 Well, I'm 5'10", I'm a hearty mix of Irish and German, and I've been known to lie about my height. 
 I meant what other magical powers do you have? 
 Uh, I have super strength. 
 (Both scoff) 
 You? 
 Yes, me. 
 Why does everyone act so surprised when I say that? 
 Because we can see your ribcage through your shirt. 
 Davenport : Guys, get up here. 
 There's something strange going on. Whoa, that is strange. Not that. Outside. Something flew by the window. I know something that's gonna fly out the window. I'm serious. There is something out there. Get down! Is everybody okay? Yeah. Look. There's something on the floor. Yeah, about $36,000 worth of glass. No. It's some sort of gift box. Stop! Dude, what are you doing? You gotta open the card first. No. Don't open anything. It could be rigged to blow this place apart. I'll use my bionic eye to scan it. It's a flash drive. I could download its contents onto my internal hard drive and play it back for everyone in mission command. Who would blast our penthouse just to toss a flash drive in the window? That's why you gotta open the card first. It's a video message. Destroying your little hospital was just the beginning. We're on the hunt for every superhero that remains, and soon, they will all be extinct. And once you've watched us eliminate them, we're coming for you, Oliver, Kaz and Skylar. And anyone else dumb enough to protect you. Who was that? And don't say check the card first. Whoever it was, it's obvious they've been watching us. I'm gonna go activate the penthouse security perimeter, and get those windows replaced. See? This is exactly why I wanted to go out and find them first. As soon as we finalize a plan... Forget your plan. If we don't stop them, they're gonna take out every last superhero, including us. They're gonna take us out a lot faster if we go into this thing unprepared. Look, I wanna find them, too. But we have to be smart about this. We have no idea what we're up against. He's right, Kaz. We have to be careful. Skylar, back me up on this. We'll get 'em. It's just gonna take some time. 
 
 Oliver? Oh, come on. Not you, too. Dude, we have to do this for Mighty Med. I know. I just... I think we should play it safe. Safe? None of us are safe with those two on the loose. You know... I never thought being part of an elite force would mean sitting around and doing nothing. Hey, what are you still doing up? I don't know. Guess I'm not really used to sleeping in a new place. Plus, Skylar snores. Your capsule's soundproof. I know. Mr. Davenport, I can't find Kaz. I thought he was in his bed snoring, but it turned out to be Skylar down the hall. I bet he went off to find those guys on his own. I'll use my super speed to bring him back. Oliver, go wake Chase and Skylar. If you're not back with Kaz in two minutes, I'm gonna have them track you on your GPS locator. Please. Two minutes? With my upgraded speed, I can search the entire city in less than 30 seconds. (Mocking) Oh, I'm so fast. Well, then, go! Okay! Okay, if I can find the costume shop that sold those guys their masks, maybe I can track them down. Eighty-six costume shops in one city? What are you people trying to hide? Ah! I mean... (Flatly) Aha, I found you! Wait. I know you guys. You're Roman and Riker. Your dad is the superhero Rodissius. Was a superhero. Until you got your hands on him at Mighty Med. What are you talking about? We saved his life. You took away his powers. We had no choice. Sacrificing his powers was the only way to keep him alive. You took away the only thing that made him special, and forced him to live his life as a mortal. That's a punishment far worse than death. That's a warped way of looking at that, but all right. Our father may not have the power to take revenge, but we do. There you are. Hello. These are the guys who destroyed Mighty Med. Oh, come on. Why are the bad ones always so cute? Okay, Bree, you can go. I got this. You know, on second thought, Bree, would you mind sticking around? Now you see why it's a bad idea to run off without a plan? In hindsight, probably not my best decision. What is that? Meet the guys who destroyed Mighty Med. They're shape shifters. Oh, okay. What the heck are shape shifters?! They can morph into anything... a person, a thing, a deadly black cloud. Get down! Chase, now would be a great time for one of your plans. Oh, now you want a plan? If you had followed my plan in the first place, we wouldn't even be in this mess. I didn't ask you guys to show up. I didn't wanna show up. I was sleeping. Both : We know. (All arguing) Hey! Where'd they go? I can still hear them. Uh... guys. Is everybody okay? Think so. Did we win? Wait. Where's Skylar? Skylar! They took her. I can't believe you let them take Skylar, all because you couldn't work together as a team. It's not my fault. He's the one who took off on his own. It doesn't matter. You're a leader. It's your responsibility to look out for them. No, Chase is right. I let my emotions get the best of me. From now on, we work together instead of against each other. Good. Now how do we find Skylar? Without a way to track her, it's almost impossible. They could've taken her anywhere. Normally when I'm looking for her, I just follow her sweet flowery scent. That's probably not gonna work today. Whatever we do, we have to move fast. Without her powers, she doesn't stand a chance against those guys. Let's check the video again. Maybe we missed something. Don't bother. I scoured every frame of that video. There's nothing there that can help us. Not even this faded number on the sign behind them? (Sheepish guffaw) Oh, come on. You have some mystical super power that allows you to see that? Yeah, it's called eyesight. Hey, wait. There's more to it, but it's covered with dirt. If I do a spectral isolation scan, I can contrast the elements to see what's under there. It's the subway station at 128th Street. There is no subway station at 128th Street. I mean, there was one 40 years ago when I was... ten years from being born. But the city abandoned it after a really bad flood. Wait. Shape shifters naturally dwell in dark, cavernous spaces. That must be where they're keeping Skylar. Let's go. I'll send the directions to your chip. You can still get there through an old underground tunnel. I used to play there 40 years ago when I was... You know, I'll send you the directions. Well, well, well. Skylar Storm. Looks like you lost this battle. You won't get away with this. My team will find me. I'm sure they will. But it'll be too late for you. By the time they get here, we'll be on to our next superhero. And the next, and the next until all of you are destroyed. Yeah, if we can actually find them. Hey! We'll find them. Because she's gonna tell us exactly where they are. Get away from her! Hey, look who it is. You just made the biggest mistake of your lives. Let's do this. Oliver, use your strength to free Skylar. Stop looking so surprised. Great, they're doing their dust bunny thing again. They're creating a ring of centrifugal force around us. Guys, if we don't do something fast, the force will crush us. Not gonna lie. Kind of okay with this. Wait. If shape shifters change their form by manipulating their molecular structures... Then there has to be a way to freeze the molecules and stop the swarm. That's it. Oliver has ice powers. Oliver, use your cryo blast. Right! Keep blowing. It worked. It's frozen solid. We actually did it. Good job, guys. Dude, that was a great idea to mess with their molecular structures. It was your idea to freeze the molecules. Yeah, but you're the one... Okay, we get it. We're a team. Guys, get together. Our first victory selfie. Silly face. (All talking at once) They got away? Yes, but this time, it was because we were too good of a team. Oh, on the bright side, we have a very cute selfie that captured the exact moment they escaped. That is a good one. You can't even see my ribs. We've gotta warn the rest of the superheroes, and let them know they're being hunted. The good news is, Roman and Riker don't even know where they are, so we should be able to alert them first. Good, but it's still gonna take some time. We got a lot of work ahead of us. Let's get some sleep. Lights out. Now can we take them out? Not yet. Let them warn the other superheroes that we're coming. That will lead us right to 'em. Those fools don't even realize it, but they just sealed their friends' fates.
