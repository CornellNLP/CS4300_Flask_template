 Announcer :  This fall on Fox, there's a new sheriff  in town... 
 ...vigorously get this man off. 
 ...and he goes by the name of Mitch Grinder. 
 I don't settle! Ever! 
 One man, against all odds. 
 Find him! 
 Fighting for justice, Guard! no matter how hard the grind. 
 I'm tired of winning on my name alone. 
 Dean Sanderson is... The Grinder. 
 There's no one he can't get off. 
 Woman : Okay, so that's  The Grinder, 
 Fox's sexy legal drama. 
 Looking for knee-jerk reactions. 
 (over intercom): First thoughts, first thoughts. 
 Dean : And these people are all from...? 
 Yeah, downtown, right off the street. 
 And they know nothing about...? 
 Anything, right. 
 Yeah, we like them coming in completely blind. 
 To everything. 
 Uh-huh. Sure. 
 Man : Tagline's super tight. 
 Woman : Interesting. 
 Warren likes the tagline. Who agrees with Warren? 
 I don't. 
 I think it's dumb. 
 Woman : Okay, Joyce thinks it's dumb. 
 Why is that? 
 What's dumb about it? 
 I just think there's gotta be someone he can't get off. 
 I mean, he can just get anybody off? 
 (scoffs) Please. 
 I'd like to see him get my brother-in-law off. 
 (laughs): Okay. Who else thinks that Joyce has a point and maybe there's somebody out there the he probably can't get off? 
 Okay, Joyce, given no one agrees with you, do you care to rethink your position at all? 
 (hesitantly): I... guess I was wrong. 
 And these people are never wrong? 
 Not according to our research. 
 Well, go on, try it out for yourself. 
 Ask them what they thought of the actor who played The Grinder. 
 What did we think about Dean Sanderson who played The Grinder? 
 Courtney? 
 I thought he was hot. 
 Courtney thought he was hot. 
 Who else thought The Grinder was hot? 
 Mmm. 
 You see? 
 Oh, this is real. 
 This works. 
 Dean : Mr. Sanderson. 
 You're being accused of malpractice, is that not correct? 
 Yeah, we know that. 
 Okay. 
 Move to have that stricken from the record. 
 Got it. 
 Dean, there is no record, so if we could just, you know, keep going. 
 Yeah, we're just prepping him for the stand. 
 Which I don't need. 
 You do need it, Dad. 
 Okay, everybody, this is not how we're going to do this. 
 Not today. 
 The negativity, the hole-poking. 
 I mean, you wanted me back, right, Stew? 
 Right? You destroyed a whole office? 
 I did, yes. And I got the guy to admit that there was somebody else behind this. 
 Even though Stewart was saying that the whole time. 
 So, this is how we're going to do this. 
 All right. I'm going to start from the top. 
 Mr. Sanderson, you're being accused of malpractice, is that... 
 No, no. I'm done. 
 Hey, you're not done until Dean says you're done. 
 Don't I get a say in this? 
 Dad, calm down. 
 I am calm! 
 This is a waste of time! 
 I've been doing this for 50 years! 
 I think I know my way around a courtroom! 
 Yes, Your Honor. 
 No, Your Honor. 
 Objection, Your Honor. 
 Dismissed, Your Honor. 
 (banging, crashing) 
 Stewart : It's a problem. 
 He is off the rails, guys. 
 Oh, come on, he's letting off a little steam. 
 And you know what? He's earned that right. 
 He yelled at me for eating his yogurt this morning. 
 Well, was it labeled? 
 Well, yeah, but... 
 Then what are we talking about? 
 We're talking about a jury, Dean, and how they're gonna respond to Dad. 
 They're gonna love him. 
 The guy is a big goose. 
 He is? 
 Maybe you guys just need an outside perspective. 
 I don't know, honey, I think we have a pretty solid inside perspective. 
 Uh, you know what? It never hurts... to listen to the people. 
 Oh, what did you do, Deb? 
 Sorry. 
 The people know. 
 Whenever we had a creative disagreement on  The Grinder, we would go to them  and let them... guide us. 
 What...? Wait, who? 
 A random focus group, E. 
 A collection of completely average strangers who help us decide what works and what doesn't. 
 For what? 
 Anything. 
 Which is why they're so valuable. 
 It's also why Mitch Grinder is the highest-testing TV character in history. 
 Okay, I'm just not sure that we need a focus group to find out if Dad has a temper. 
 Well, no, I'm not either. 
 But what if we could use the focus group to get us from "not sure" to definitely sure? 
 On whether or not we need them? 
 On all of it. 
 You know what? I'm going to set this up. 
 It could be helpful. 
 Oh, yeah. 
 I'm sure the people Dean finds at the mall will be invaluable. 
 You're probably just too close to it. 
 Or maybe I'm the appropriate distance to it, honey, and I'm just right. 
 In that case, I'm sure the focus group will sniff that out and have your back. 
 I don't know, will they? 
 I mean, who are these people? 
 And why do I need them coming to my office telling me how to do my job? 
 Whoa! Are we sure your dad's the one with the anger problem? 
 I'm getting a lot of heat coming from you right now. 
 Okay. 
 You know, hon... Thank... Good night. 
 Maybe that focus group could help  you  out a little bit. 
 All right. 
 Thank you, honey. That's a great note. 
 They're out there. 
 I can feel it. 
 We just gotta find the right people. 
 At the mall?! 
 At the mall, Todd. 
 Middle of the week. 
 Middle of the day. 
 Uh-huh. Why?! 
 We're looking for drifters. 
 People with nowhere to be, just breezin' through their lives, nothin' on their minds. 
 Yeah. 
 No distractions like work or thoughts. 
 Blank slates. 
 And, of course, a willingness to do whatever we want for 20 bucks on a Wednesday. 
 Then what? 
 Well, then we blindly trust those people and allow them to steer us in the handling of my father's case. 
 Ah, yeah, that makes sense. 
 Yeah, yeah. 
 They're out there, we just gotta find 'em. 
 How? 
 Todd, I think it's the constant questions, more than anything else, that so frustrating for me. 
 Oh, right, and I'm sorry about that. 
 You had to have felt that, right? 
 I did. 
 As soon as I... 
 Opened your mouth? 
 Yes. 
 And you did it anyway. 
 I had to ask because I was... 
 Curious. 
 Mm-hmm. 
 Well, I love that about you, but it's just very demoralizing. 
 Sure. 
 I get that. 
 Dean : We got a good group. 
 Diverse group, which I like. 
 That's great, Dean. 
 And totally necessary. 
 Yeah, and they're just... folks, you know? 
 Salt of the earth. 
 Mm. 
 I like the process. 
 Seems like the simplest, most logical way to do it. 
 You know, I could really use a focus group of my own to give me some daily feedback. 
 'Cause I'm obviously doing something wrong. 
 So, wait, you want a group of people to tell you how lame you are? 
 Uncle Dean, can we arrange that? 
 No, we cannot arrange that. 
 And we don't need to, honey. 
 Lizzie, you can't worry about what other people think. 
 Wow. Okay, I understand that there are different parenting styles, but that sounds insane. 
 You don't care what other people think? 
 How are you supposed to know how to behave? 
 You just... be yourself. 
 Ethan : Even in Lizzie's case? 
 Feels like that's gonna come up short, no? 
 Ethan. 
 Guys, it's okay. He's right. I need help. 
 We all do. There's no shame in it. 
 Behind every big decision in my life, has been a focus group weighing in. 
 Even the move to Boise? 
 Oh, tested huge. 
 Interesting. 
 You know what, I'll have Todd print out some comment cards and you can distribute them at school. 
 Awesome. Thanks, Uncle Dean. 
 Great. 
 No problem. Oh, oh, hey, uh, can Stewart and I have the room? 
 Um... 
 You want us to leave? This room? 
 Right now? 
 Yeah, we need the room. Do you mind? 
 Ethan : Okay. 
 Lizzie : I guess. 
 (clears throat) 
 What are you doing? 
 Checking on you. 
 For tomorrow. 
 Oh, you mean the... the focus group thing? 
 Yes! 
 And, Stew, it's okay to be nervous. 
 'Cause you may hear some things about your father, things that are going to make you feel very uncomfortable. 
 Things that no son should ever have to hear. 
 Really? Like what? 
 I don't know. 
 It's an very unpredictable process. 
 But it is also an infallible one. 
 So I need to know that you're going to hear the feedback, and that you're going to then make the necessary adjustments. 
 What do you say? 
 I mean, I think we should... 
 Ah, yeah, trust the process. 
 So just sit back and-and take it all in. 
 Um, underneath your seats you'll find your comment cards, so write down any thoughts that you might have. 
 Oh... 
 Yes. 
 What are we watching? 
 It's best if you don't know. 
 That way you're going in completely blind and you have no preconceived notions. 
 Um, and remember, there is no thought that is not worth having. 
 And sharing. 
 Okay. Stew, you're up. 
 Uh... Okay. 
 Could you please, uh, state your name for the record? 
 I'd be happy to. 
 Dean Thomas Sanderson Sr. 
 I reside... 
 That's good. Thank you. Uh, how many years have you been practicing law? 
 Well, gee, uh, it's been nearly 50 years, hasn't it? 
 It has. Yes. 
 Uh, great. 
 How many of you are having a hard time hearing Stewart? Could you speak up a little bit? 
 I-I think the panel's having a hard time hearing you. 
 I just feel like I'm shouting. 
 Okay. All right, sir, what, um... (clears throat) what is your relationship with alcohol? 
 What are you trying to get at? 
 Well, isn't it true that during this time, you would have a couple of drinks during the workday? 
 Objection! 
 No, Todd, you can't... That's not... 
 There's no objections. 
 We're just... Dad, these are the questions they're gonna ask you. 
 So if you could just answer, please. 
 Well, everybody drank. That was the time. 
 It was 1998. 
 Stewart : Well, isn't it possible, uh, that you had... 
 How many of you are having a hard time seeing Dean Sr.? 
 Stewart, I think if you just move a little bit... 
 Is that better? 
 Mm-hmm. 
 Great. 
 So, Dad, isn't it possible that at some point during this case you had one too many and you got a little sloppy and that's why you lost a decision that Mr. Manler is still paying for today? 
 I got that kid a great deal! 
 This is bullcrap! 
 I'm out of here. 
 Hey! What are you writin'? If you got something to say to me, say it to my face! 
 Yeah, I didn't think so. 
 It seemed like the old dude got real angry for no reason. 
 Who else thought that the old dude got real angry for no reason? 
 How 'bout that? 
 Any other first impressions? 
 Uh, it seemed like the guy asking the questions was a little... weak? 
 Oh, uh, no, no, you-you must've misunderstood. 
 This is not about me. 
 Stewart, the people are speaking. 
 Who else thought that Stewart was weak? 
 No, I didn't really think he was weak. 
 Well, thank you. 
 I just didn't really buy that he was a lawyer. 
 No offense. 
 Quite all right. 
 Yeah, he never said "objection" once. That bugged me. 
 He had no charisma. 
 Woman : The woman, though, she was great. 
 Yeah, I loved her dry delivery. 
 Yeah. I want to see more of her. 
 What? 
 Yes! That! 
 Man : So funny. 
 
 
 
 Hey. 
 Hey. 
 How'd it go? 
 Uh, good. The testing group thought Dad came off angry, so Dean agrees with me now. 
 So it was helpful. 
 Yeah, so helpful. 
 Any time you can get six strangers from the mall to validate what you've been saying all along... 
 Oh, yeah, that-that must feel good. 
 It's a great day. 
 (chuckles) 
 Uh, hey, Deb... 
 I seem lawyerly to you, right? 
 What? 
 Well, you know, like... 
 I'm a lawyer and I seem like one. 
 (door opens) 
 Dean : Guys, we have a problem. 
 The game... just changed. 
 What game? 
 Yeah, what are you talking about? 
 We have an outlier. 
 A stray comment on a card that almost got by us. 
 Okay. Uh, what is it? 
 "It seemed like the white-haired guy was hiding something." 
 Right? 
 It's a stunner. 
 Is it? 
 Well, I don't think that's the question we should be asking, Deb. 
 I think the question we should be asking is: What is it? 
 Maybe nothing? 
 Yeah, 'cause only one person said it. 
 No, you can't just pick and choose the notes that you're going to listen to. 
 You either listen to all of them or you listen to none of them. 
 Oh. Well, then none of them. Because no one else thought Dad was hiding anything. 
 And they didn't think he  wasn't hiding anything either. 
 So they're supposed to write down everything they  didn't  think? 
 So, I got some feedback from some girls at school, and apparently half of them don't even know who I am. 
 Do you see what happens, Dean? 
 Debbie : Honey, if it's any consolation to you, we know exactly who you are. 
 Well, my friends kept it pretty positive. 
 Mostly asking for more of some stuff but nothing I can't deliver on. 
 Guys, we can either stick our head in the sand or we can deal with the facts. 
 Lizzie, you're forgettable. 
 We know that now. So the question becomes what are we gonna do about it? 
 Nothing, she's perfect. 
 No. 
 I will do whatever it takes. 
 Damn right you will. And so will we. 
 Stew, get out your shovel, 'cause we have got some... 
 Digging to do. 
 ...digging to do. 
 Right. Got it. 
 Stewart : So it's unanimous, Dad has a severe anger problem. 
 So what do we do about it? 
 Dean : So we're just going to ignore it? 
 Ignore what? 
 Stewart knows what. 
 One guy thought Dad was hiding something. 
 Oh, that sounds like something. 
 That's because it is something, Todd. 
 No, it isn't anything. We just need to get Dad ready for the stand. 
 Okay, what about the next stand and the stand after that? 
 Yeah, what about those two stands? 
 What? 
 Dean, how 'bout this? 
 Since everyone thought he came off angry and only one person thought he was maybe hiding something, we deal with the anger first. 
 What if I told you... 
 (scraping) 
 ...that the anger was caused by guilt? 
 Over what he was hiding. 
 Yeah. That's where my head went as well. 
 I think it's where everybody's head went. 
 Nope. Not my head. 
 We figure that out... the old man sings on the stand. 
 (scraping) 
 All right. 
 Thank you, Todd. 
 ♪ 
 What's with the glasses? 
 Oh. I, uh... You know, my left eye gets a little fuzzy. 
 Mmm. 
 Until I go see the doctor, I'm just gonna wear these, 'cause it seems to really help. 
 Stewart. 
 The focus group said that there were a few areas I could improve in. 
 I thought we didn't care what other people think. 
 No, we don't care. 
 I don't care. 
 I'm just taking what's useful. You know, not all of it, like Dean. Just, you know, parts. 
 Uh-huh. 
 Okay, well, in that case... 
 Guys! (panting) 
 Why are you breathing so hard? 
 What's wrong? 
 Uh, no-no time to explain. Say something nice about Lizzie's hair. 
 Wow! 
 Look at... you! 
 Stewart : That is a really... What a... strong... 
 That's a bold choice. choice you've made. 
 Really nice, honey. 
 Yeah, thanks for noticing. Nobody at school did. 
 Doubt that. 
 No. I'm invisible, and I guess there's just nothing (voice breaking): I can ever do to change that. 
 Okay, first of all, that's not true. 
 Mm-mm. 
 And second of all, you shouldn't be listening to those people. 
 Yeah. Glasses? 
 That's different. 
 Is it? 
 You know what? You guys are all getting all this feedback. 
 How 'bout you give me some feedback? 
 Well, it's a... slippery slope. 
 No, come on. You guys can be my focus group. It'll be so fun. 
 We should do, like, another Oh, no, no, I'm gonna pass family activity. 
 on that one. 
 What? Why? 
 Yeah, that's not a good one. 
 What are you ta... 
 Okay, all right, well, then you guys get out of here. 
 I need to talk to your dad. 
 What was that all about? 
 You know, honey, sometimes you... 
 You know, you're not so good at taking criticism. 
 Oh. 
 Yeah. 
 (chuckles) 
 Wow. 
 I... Are you mad? 
 Dean Sr. :  How many times do I have to tell you? 
 I am not angry, I'm just telling it like it is. 
 It's not what's coming across, apparently. 
 Dad, there was another card that we didn't tell you about. 
 Oh, yeah? What'd it say? 
 What are you hiding, Pop? 
 What? 
 I'm not hiding anything. 
 Is that something one of those mall people said? 
 Yes, it's something one of the mall people said. 
 And we know they're never wrong. 
 We do? 
 I'll wait here all day... until you tell me the truth. 
 Yeah? 
 Yeah. 
 So, um, I couldn't help but notice that you... you tested pretty high with that focus group in there. 
 Oh, I did? I don't pay attention to that stuff. 
 Because of that right there. How do you do that? 
 Do what? 
 Just, like... not care about stuff. 
 You know? I mean, I internalize everything so much and it makes me insane. 
 You're so chill all the time. Do you have any... any tips? 
 I don't know. I just kind of... do whatever. 
 There it is again. 
 Wow. 
 (chuckles) 
 I'm gonna walk away now, okay? 
 Yeah, yeah. 
 You guys are wasting your time. 
 You're my sons, I would tell you anything. 
 I used to believe that, but now I'm not so sure. 
 Damn it, Deano. 
 You would believe a couple of strangers over your own father? I thought I brought you boys up better than that. 
 (door opens, then slams) 
 That's great, Dean. Now he's even angrier. 
 It's even worse. 
 He's telling the truth. 
 How is that worse? 
 (sighs heavily) 
 I always thought the people could never be wrong. 
 I trusted them. 
 I believed in them. 
 And they were wrong. 
 Hey, Dean! 
 You have to get dressed. 
 Dad's thing starts in an hour. 
 Ah, what does it matter? 
 Turns out six people in a mall don't have all the answers. 
 Yeah, but you had to know that, right? 
 On some level? 
 I broke up with Sela Ward because a focus group rated our on-screen chemistry as "fine." 
 Okay. 
 What's with the suit? 
 What? Nothing. Just a... just a suit. 
 Just a suit? 
 Yeah. 
 You're taking the note, aren't you? 
 What? No. No. I... 
 Don't. Stewart, you were right. 
 The people can be wrong, and... 
 I know that now. 
 And maybe, just maybe, they shouldn't be the ultimate authority on things that they know nothing about. 
 Or maybe there's a middle ground, Dean, where we listen to them and we just take what we need? 
 You really are a dreamer, aren't you? 
 Don't ever lose that. 
 Oh, I won't. Thank you. 
 So you're really not going? 
 (sighs heavily) The system failed. 
 It failed all of us. 
 Mr. Sanderson, you are a... licensed attorney, are you not? 
 That's correct. 
 Well, then, sir, tell me, from one lawyer to another lawyer... are you guilty? 
 No, I'm not. 
 Because the law clearly states that we are all innocent until proven guilty. 
 Man, Stew's really going for it. 
 What? 
 Oh, you are just always on, huh? 
 Stewart : Is it your opinion, Mr. Sanderson, that you defended your client... to the best of your ability? 
 You're damn right I did. 
 Objection. 
 Great answer. 
 No, I'm glad you're responding to it, Chad. 
 No, I just, uh, woke up one morning and thought, "Why not?" 
 Who's she talking to? 
 Chad Oseroff. He likes her hair. 
 He's been calling her non-stop. 
 Lizzie, hang up the phone. 
 What? 
 Hang up the phone. 
 No. Why? Sorry, my uncle's being weird. I don't know what's going on. Uncle Dean, what are you doing? Okay, bye, Chad, I'll call you back. 
 No, she won't, no, she will not. 
 I don't want you talking to that young man anymore. 
 Why? Your cards worked. I made an adjustment based on the notes and now that boy likes me. 
 It's a fluke. 
 The system isn't foolproof. 
 Notes don't always make things better. 
 Uncle Dean, all my cards came back positive. Are they wrong? 
 They may be, Ethan. They may be. 
 Oh, Dad, what have I done? 
 Where are you going? 
 To put a stop to this. 
 'Cause I don't think anybody else can. 
 I-Is anyone else trying to? 
 Then why weren't you able to get him off? 
 Was it because of all the drinking? 
 Or do you not even remember because you were too drunk to know the difference? 
 Drunk? No. 
 Are you sure? 
 I did my best, all right? It's complicated! 
 What do you want to hear? 
 It's complicated? 
 Dad, what... what happened? 
 Maybe I screwed up. 
 I didn't bring the deal to Cory. 
 I just took it. 
 Oh, crap. 
 Wow. 
 Even when care it still feels like you don't. 
 It's amazing. 
 (door opens) 
 Stop. Stop. 
 This isn't right. 
 No, Dean, we Al... 
 No, no, no, no, Stewart, look around you. 
 Look at who we're listening to. 
 Randos from the mall. 
 You brought them here. 
 Yes, yes, I brought them here. Because I've been living my life based on comment cards from groups just like this one, and it's been a mistake. We should be able to make mistakes. We shouldn't have to be flawless all the time, so focus groups like every single thing about us. 
 Yes, but Dean, you were right. 
 The focus group was right. Dad just admitted that he was hiding something. 
 What? 
 Yeah, and I feel a lot better now. 
 I knew they couldn't be wrong. 
 You were right, Deano. The testing process was flawless. 
 And order is restored. 
 I'm so relieved. 
 Yeah, we all are. 
 Okay, but how do we deal with the fact that, um, Dad is guilty? 
 Stewart, can we take one moment to luxuriate in the glory of it? 
 The glory of what? 
 The cards. 
 Marjorie, from Garden City, Idaho, wrote, "Saw a huge difference in the curly-haired dude from day one to day two. Whatever he did, he should do more of it, because for the first time, I bought him as a lawyer." 
 Read it and weep. 
 She's right. You made a heck of an improvement, son. 
 We're so proud of you. We all are. 
 Yeah, so proud. 
 It's a real achievement. 
 Okay, yes, great. Thank you all very much. 
 But you know what? I... I don't really care. 
 Even if they didn't buy me as a lawyer, so what? 
 I am one. And that's what really matters. 
 Yeah, but they  did  buy you as one, and that matters more. 
 Good point. 
 Ethan : So, the rules are as follows: Mom may not interrupt the focus group. 
 Hm. 
 Mom may not take action against us if Mom does not like something she hears. 
 Got it. Gimme. 
 You sure, honey? 
 'Cause you can still back out. 
 What? No. Come on, bring it. 
 Okay. 
 Well, um, sometimes, in the mornings, uh... 
 Uh-huh? 
 ...before you've had your coffee, you h... 
 Okay, you know what? No. 
 No, no. No. I am... I'm good, thanks. 
 Okay. (laughing) 
 I'm not even... I'm just... 
 (whoops) 
 So what do I do with this list? I got a bunch of stuff on it. 
 N... Mm-mmm. Get rid of that.
