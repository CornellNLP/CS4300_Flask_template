 Previously on Powers... 
 Where the f*ck have you been? 
 At Supershock's. 
 He's lost his mind. 
 He's literally crazy. 
 We have seven possible Powers bodies that have just dropped out of the sky dead all around the city. 
 f*ck me. 
 Come on, Patrick. 
 I know you can hear me if you want to. 
 Why would Supershock be killing all the Powers? 
 It's not. 
 It's this Morrison maniac. 
 Kutter's in a coma because of that asshole. 
 Where are you hiding him?! 
 Why are your powers hiding Morrison?! 
 Where is he?! 
 He tried to kill me. 
 He kept calling me "Janice". 
 Have you had any contact with an active Power? 
 All right. Call dispatch. 
 This body... 
 Every Power that we have contact with is, technically, if you think about it, a biological hazard. 
 We don't know how this environment is affecting our biological machines. 
 Supershock killed the senator. 
 If a Power at this level is taking the law into his own hands, what the f*ck do we do? 
 Let's do this. Let's stop him. 
 I would like to help. 
 So, how do we kill the highest-level Power ever? 
 We give him something he wants. 
 Everybody, meet Morrison. 
 Morrison, everybody. 
 [ SIBERIA 1968 ] 
 Drink? 
 I have no money. 
 Not the way you're dressed. 
 Standard gulag issue. 
 Don't worry. 
 It doesn't pay to turn you in. 
 To freedom. 
 You've earned it. 
 Nostrovia. 
 Where am I? 
 The end of the world, my friend. 
 And the year? 
 You've been away for awhile? 
 Answer the question. 
 Nineteen sixty-eight. 
 Powers... 
 Do they still rule? 
 They're everywhere. Seems like more show up every day. 
 The great one is gone. 
 Supershock? 
 He's dead? 
 Vanished. 
 What happened? 
 Last year. He finally met his match. 
 His match? 
 A monster named... 
 Morrison. 
 Why would he just turn himself in? He didn't even put up a struggle. 
 He didn't. 
 Dude just surrendered. 
 That m*therf*cker has outlived his expiration date. 
 Can I trust you in there? 
 Sure. 
 I brought him in, didn't I? 
 You didn't answer my question, Detective. 
 Yes, Sir. I just want to get a confession out of him, put his ass on ice for the rest of his sorry life, and get back to fighting the good fight. 
 All right then. 
 Maybe Morrison is a key to at least figuring out where the hell SuperShock is. 
 The b*st*rd won't survive SuperShock. 
 Perhaps. 
 But it's a chance I'm willing to take. 
 Commander... 
 Let's put the word out there. 
 Talk to your reporter friend at PTB. 
 Nicole Glantz. Tell her we've got Morrison. 
 That's not a good idea. 
 Fine. 
 Gary, get Fuller in here. 
 Fuller? 
 Can you think of a less conspicuous Deep Throat? 
 Meanwhile, get what you can out of Morrison. 
 Confession, clue, stock tips, whatever. 
 And keep him out of your head, Pilgrim. 
 Remember, he's been working people for decades, maybe longer. 
 Don't worry. 
 I have a good f*cking idea of how to handle him. 
 As Powers continue to die, murdered and falling to the streets, the institution charged with investigating and stopping these killings has, and I quote, "No comment." 
 What is the Powers Division hiding? 
 Is it their complete and utter inability to keep the public safe? 
 We want answers. 
 Big man, big appetite. 
 Hey, I like it spicy too. 
 I wasn't expecting you. Like, actually you. 
 Like... I was thinking you'd send like a minion or something. 
 Someone from the Powers Division tells my assistant they've got a tip, I'm all ears. 
 They can't use my name. 
 Absolutely no, Mr. "Unnamed Source." 
 You have my word. 
 So, what's the story? 
 You've got something on the Powers killings? 
 We've got a suspect in custody. 
 Who? 
 Oh, come on. Don't chicken out now. 
 His name is Morrison. 
 The Morrison? 
 SuperShock's nemesis. 
 But he's dead. 
 He's been dead for a long time. 
 Nope. 
 Holy sh1t. 
 He's behind the killings? 
 Does SuperShock know? 
 If he did, would I be out here? 
 And Cross. He's buried this, hasn't he? 
 Commander Cross. 
 He's afraid of SuperShock going all vigilante. 
 Yeah. Morrison's a maniac. 
 Total. And he's sitting in Powers Division right now like a fox in a goddamn henhouse. 
 Hell, yes. Yeah. 
 Hey, thank you. 
 Thank you. 
 Holy sh1t! 
 Move the f*ck over, James Bond. 
 Detectives Pilgrim and Walker, resuming questioning of suspect John Morrison. 
 So you're The Ghost? 
 You are SuperShock's nemesis? 
 I thought you'd be... I don't know, more. 
 What are you doing here? Why did you come in peacefully with Detective Pilgrim? 
 Let's just say I'm not the man I used to be. 
 Stop f*cking around, Morrison, what does that mean? 
 Time, Detective. 
 Cosmic drainer. 
 She gets us all eventually, even The Ghost. 
 Ever since my powers failed me, I've tried to lead a quiet life. 
 A simple life. 
 I've taken great pains to avoid controversy. 
 You lost your powers... 
 So stabbing a police officer in the guts is your idea of a quiet life? 
 That was a mistake. 
 A grave error in judgment. 
 Your colleague took me by surprise. 
 Yeah, I bet he f*cking did. 
 We have a surprise for you too. 
 A surprise? 
 We kind of told the press we're hiding you here, so it's only a matter of time before SuperShock finds out. 
 Why would you do something like that? 
 Grave error in judgment. 
 Or some sh1t like that. 
 You've been standing in front of the oncoming train that is SuperShock all your life. 
 You can't blame us if it hits you. 
 So, I'm bait? 
 Yeah. 
 Whatever happened to protect and to serve? 
 We do it on a case by case basis here at Powers Division. 
 I hope you're not going to let your colleague here convince you to do something you'll regret. 
 Are you talking to her or me? 
 See, I think you're confusing the good cop, bad cop thing. 
 See, I'm the good cop and she is... 
 Well, Detective Pilgrim would just as soon kill you as talk to you. 
 You know why? 
 Because you didn't just stab her colleague, you violently attacked the man she loves. 
 What do you want from me? 
 I want your help. 
 Yeah, you're probably the last person alive that knows SuperShock as well as Janice. 
 Giving us a hint, or a clue, anything that would get through to him to stop him from tearing apart the city, f*ck the whole world, would be a big help. 
 That's a tall order. 
 And quite frankly, there isn't time to give you the full story. 
 You have time. 
 I'll give you the headline. 
 Please. 
 SuperShock is completely, 100% out of his mind. 
 If he decides to destroy the entire world, there's absolutely nothing, and I mean nothing, that any of us, living Power or otherwise, can do about it. 
 You look so good. 
 I look like an idiot. 
 You look heroic. 
 Calista? Can I talk to you for a second? 
 Honestly, do you ever get used to this? 
 Oh, no, that's always the hardest part, is getting used to the outfit. 
 Yeah. 
 Not so much for me. 
 That's because you always wanted to be a Power. 
 Well, you're a Power now too. 
 What's up? 
 What's up is that. 
 We're feeling a little not consulted. 
 About what? 
 About him joining the team. 
 We talked about this. 
 And you made a decision. 
 We need him. 
 He doesn't want in, Calista. 
 You're forcing this on him and us. 
 He's untested. 
 I would say he's just going to get himself killed, but so what? 
 What's 'what' is he's going to get us killed. 
 No, I won't. 
 They're right. 
 This is a bad idea. 
 Krispin, don't... 
 Honestly, I hate Powers. 
 I hate you. 
 The last thing I want is to be part of this bullshit. 
 Certainly Retro Girl must have warned you about this, Detective Walker. 
 She didn't tell you? 
 She told me enough. 
 Then you know about Caracas. 
 I know about the earthquake. 
 It was no earthquake, Detective. 
 It was SuperShock. 
 Oh, the f*ck you say. 
 They did a good job of covering it up. 
 Well, Janice did. 
 Man, that woman knew how to spin a story. 
 Thousands and thousands of innocent people killed at the hands of an out-of-control monster, and the world believes it was a natural disaster. 
 And the cherry on top is that a grateful public is convinced that SuperShock, Retro Girl, and that poor devil Cobalt Knight came to the rescue. 
 My God! 
 Genius. 
 So you had nothing to do with it? 
 I was rotting away in a Gulag. 
 Put there by Khrushchev himself. 
 Even if I wanted to mix it up with Patrick, by then, my powers had begun to wane. 
 You know that Patrick thinks you're responsible for just about every chaotic thing that's happened in the world since forever. 
 Well, I can't deny that we had quite the game of cat-and-mouse going for a while, but that was a long time ago. 
 And since then? 
 Since then? Well, let's see. 
 I... read the newspaper. 
 I drank red wine. I joined a bowling league. 
 I opened a record shop. 
 Always did have a passion for music. 
 Oh, and I made a point of staying far away from anything to do with Powers. 
 Let's say I believe you. 
 What about SuperShock, where has he been for 40 years? 
 Well, I can only imagine that Retro Girl must have convinced him to retire. 
 Kept him and his madness out of public view. 
 Kept him protected and isolated, and in so doing, protected the world from him. 
 When I heard she had been murdered, well, I knew it was just a matter of time until the ticking time bomb that is SuperShock would go off. 
 Speak of the devil. 
 I want Morrison. 
 Out of the way. 
 I want Morrison now! 
 You hear me? 
 Patrick, put him down. 
 I want Morrison. 
 Right here, right now. 
 I'm afraid I can't do that, Patrick. 
 He's ours now, see... 
 Get out of my way, Diamond. 
 Think... okay? 
 It's over. 
 It's over when he's dead! 
 I've been waiting for this for 50 years. 
 It's over when he's dead. 
 Get out of my way. 
 Janice wouldn't want this. 
 Janice... 
 She knows all about this. She was there. 
 She's on my side. 
 She's seen everything. 
 She knows exactly why this must be done. 
 Janice! 
 Janice! 
 Patrick, Janice is gone. 
 I'm gonna tell you again, get out of my way. 
 She's dead, okay. 
 You know it's true, Patrick. 
 You have to know. 
 No. 
 She's gone. 
 I'm sorry, man. 
 No. 
 No, no, no. 
 No! 
 No! 
 What the hell? 
 SuperShock. 
 Patrick. 
 Morrison killed her. 
 He murdered her. 
 He murdered her, goddamn it! 
 Patrick, listen to me. 
 We caught Janice's killer. 
 And it wasn't Morrison. 
 Why do you keep lying to me, Diamond? 
 Sir, Sir. 
 You remember the crisis in Cuba? 
 1963, of course I remember. 
 Who the f*ck are you?! 
 Commander Emile Cross, LAPD. 
 And a great admirer of yours. 
 My grandfather was in the Navy, he was in the blockade. 
 It was about to be World War III, and you stopped it. 
 You saved his life, which meant I got to live mine, and create all of this. 
 And all we do is capture and punish the people that you've spent your life hunting. 
 So you don't have to do it anymore. 
 It's all right. 
 We've got it. 
 And they've got me. 
 Tulsa, Oklahoma. One way. 
 That'll be $78.23. 
 What are you doing? 
 I'm leaving. 
 How did you find me? 
 I could hear your voice. 
 Powers. 
 Why Tulsa? 
 My grandparents... 
 You know, it doesn't matter, you can't go. 
 I can and I am. 
 Well, we need you. 
 You might. They don't. 
 The world needs you, Krispin. 
 SuperShock is off the rails and you're the only one that could survive him. 
 You want me to take on SuperShock. 
 I want you to help us. 
 After he kills me he'll kill you. 
 Your ticket, Sir. 
 Then I'll wake up and you'll be gone. 
 And you won't be coming back. 
 You knew me before all of this, before I had powers. 
 And I know you've lost everyone you love because of them, and, yeah, maybe I'll be next, but right now, with everything that's happening, I need you here. 
 No. Listen, hey. 
 If you kill him, nothing is gonna change. 
 He killed Janice. 
 He killed Bailey. 
 He's killing the Powers. 
 He's nothing but a destroyer. 
 Janice wrote a letter. 
 It was in Senator Brown's safe. 
 But you took that letter, Patrick. 
 You took it after you killed him. 
 You killed the Cobalt Knight. 
 It was Morrison. 
 Powers are dying at your hand. 
 Caracas was you. 
 It wasn't an earthquake... 
 Cuba. 
 Cuba was my last hurrah. 
 Yours, too, it turns out. 
 My powers had failed me. 
 I ran. 
 But the Russians caught up to me. 
 And they punished me. 
 And you know what I thought about the entire time? 
 I thought about you, Patrick. 
 Just as you've thought about me. 
 We've kept each other alive, you and I. 
 You need me. 
 You ain't even him. 
 You look like him. You kind of sound like him. 
 But you ain't no destroyer. 
 Ain't got no chaos in you. 
 Patrick. 
 I created you. In a forest in France. Don't you remember? 
 Janice made me. Made me just the way I am. I never saw you before in my life. 
 No! 
 
 
 
 Are you all right? 
 This sucks. 
 Welcome back. 
 Hi. 
 This is better than anything I ever could have hoped for. 
 We're still short on answers here at Powers Division headquarters, but it looks as if there's been some sort of confrontation between SuperShock and the authorities inside. 
 No, we get that Terry, what I'm asking is have you seen any sign of Morrison being a part of this situation? 
 It's Terrence, Nicole, and no, so far there's been no confirmation of your allegations of SuperShock's nemesis... 
 They're not my allegations, Terrence it's my strong belief that Morrison is there, under arrest for the murders of Powers and that SuperShock's purpose there was to settle scores. 
 Well, if there are scores being settled I'm not aware of it. 
 But as soon as I am, you'll be the first to know about it. 
 Back to you in the studio. 
 Thank you, Terry. 
 PTB will continue following this story and if we get any more information about the incident, I'll bring it to you. 
 Wow! That was spectacular. 
 What exactly were you thinking?! 
 We were doing our job! 
 Really? What exactly was the plan? 
 Circle up, let him kill you one by f*cking one? 
 It's SuperShock. 
 Level 10 Power. 
 Tank fire, cluster bombs, ICBMs, nothing even makes a dent. 
 Hell, even our Powers combined he's out of our league. 
 You don't think we know that? 
 Maybe you forgot. 
 We can't beat him, Walker, okay, we get it. 
 I never said that. 
 Okay? I never said that, but you don't beat SuperShock by trying to overpower him. 
 Then how do we do it? 
 Calista, I need you to fly me up to SuperShock's cabin, and we figure out how Janice kept him defused all these years. 
 And then, we try to defuse him the same way. 
 And if he's there? 
 Talk slow, run fast. 
 Then let's go. 
 I should go. Just in case he needs to act out again. 
 No. You've died enough already. 
 I'll go. 
 If things go south I can protect us long enough to get Walker out of there. 
 Don't do anything stupid. 
 When has that ever happened? 
 You, lover boy. 
 Need you to get to Triphammer's. 
 We need everything you can find on Retro Girl since 1967. 
 Triphammer was a part of Powers United. 
 Maybe he noticed something, something connected with Retro Girl, keeping SuperShock quiet. 
 Got it. You coming with us? 
 No. No, I gotta see someone. 
 Before it's too late. 
 You can't fool me. 
 'Cause I know exactly what you're doing. 
 I'm controlling you. 
 I've been controlling you your entire life. 
 I'm the one that's pulling the strings. 
 But not anymore. 
 Forever, Patrick. 
 From the time you knew you were different, I was there. 
 Telling you to just let go. 
 Release all that power within you. 
 Bring all the trouble in the world, all the pain and suffering to an end. 
 You can do that. 
 It just takes a little courage. 
 All you want is destruction. 
 All I want is peace. 
 So do you. 
 And you can make that happen, Patrick. 
 End all this sorrow. 
 All this grief. 
 Just end it. 
 Rip out the world's heart and simply watch it die. 
 Save yourself. 
 I can't do that, Janice. 
 I can't do that. 
 I'm sorry, Janice. I just can't do that. 
 Janice! 
 Janice! 
 Patrick. 
 Patrick? 
 Patrick? 
 He's not here. 
 Wow, this is where... where the greatest superhero of all time made his home? 
 It's depressing. 
 In a weird way, I get it. 
 Really? 
 The noise. 
 It gets to you after a while. 
 Of the city? 
 No, of the world. 
 Super-hearing. It's kind of a bitch. 
 All of these magazines are from the 80s. 
 THINGS FOR PATRICK TO DO: 
 It's Janice's handwriting. 
 She was taking care of him. 
 Was keeping him calm. 
 How did she find the time to do that? 
 I mean, she had personal appearances. 
 She's fighting battles all over the world. 
 How did she come up here to take care of him? 
 Hardly a hop, skip, and a jump away, even for Powers. 
 Things you do for love. 
 What do you think, Walker? 
 I'm thinking she should have told me. 
 You know, I could have helped her. 
 Helped him. 
 Well, is that even possible? 
 To help him I mean? 
 Well, she did it for 40 years. 
 FLY TO HERE AT 4 
 She didn't just come to him, he came to her. 
 That looks familiar. 
 Yeah. It's the final approach to Griffith Park. 
 Yeah, sure, okay. 
 What the f*ck. 
 How'd you get my address? 
 Such a thing as privacy, you know? 
 Not when it comes to public safety. 
 Glantz... 
 You're tap dancing on my last nerve. 
 I'm gonna need you to get gone, before I get you gone. 
 What happened at Powers Division between Morrison and SuperShock? 
 None of your goddamn business. 
 I know about SuperShock. 
 Off the reservation, isn't he? 
 We've got cellphone footage of SuperShock grabbing Rainbow right before her death. 
 In that case, I've got you withholding evidence of a crime, I can haul your ass to jail right now until you turn it over. 
 I'm just trying to get to the truth. Okay? 
 Oh, give me a f*cking break, Nicole. 
 SuperShock is terrorizing the city, and Powers Division hasn't got one goddamn clue what to do, do you? 
 You guys are f*cked and now so is the world. 
 It's a good story. 
 It's a f*cking Pulitzer Prize... 
 Oh, no, not this, not right now, f*ck. 
 This is like looking through grandpa's garage. 
 Document scans go back to the 1940s. 
 Anything on SuperShock? 
 Yeah, tons. 
 Triphammer documented everything up to Caracas. 
 Pretty much the same with Retro Girl until her death. 
 Oh, man. 
 What? 
 It's his personal diary. 
 "I don't actually believe in everlasting love, but if there were a candidate it would have been Janice. She made me feel whole for the first time in my life." 
 Shouldn't have read that. 
 No. 
 Okay. 
 The name Janice first appeared in 1985. 
 Listen to this. 
 "Feels weird to call her Janice. Maybe someday I'll get used to it. She introduced me to Diamond today. Cocky fucker. Why she shtups him, I have no idea." 
 But he was Diamond. 
 Yeah, no sh1t. 
 Here's another entry. 
 "Janice got serious on me today. Over wine she warned me, one day we may have to deal with a Power that can't be fought, can't be stopped. Not even by her. She genuinely looked frightened. Never thought I would see that in her." 
 Man, she was talking about SuperShock. 
 Yeah. 
 Did you find him? 
 No. 
 There's a chance that we might find him at Griffith Park. 
 So how do we stop him? 
 How did Retro Girl do it? 
 She just took care of him for so long. 
 I wonder if SuperShock even remembers it... 
 Well, he's... 
 He's our responsibility now. 
 Do you have a plan? 
 I have some ideas. 
 Mostly, I have faith, hope. 
 Oh, so, not a great plan then? 
 I have faith that you guys can be better heroes than I was... Am. 
 You know why Janice didn't tell me about Patrick? 
 Because she was protecting me. 
 She knew "Diamond" couldn't... couldn't handle it. 
 Put on that suit for all the wrong reasons, and... she couldn't trust me. 
 Not with this. 
 So, the question is... 
 Do you guys trust me? 
 Just tell us what to do. 
 Hi, there. 
 Mind if I come in? 
 I think we got off to a bad start. 
 Detective? 
 Don't speak. 
 No need to speak. 
 Okay, here's the thing. 
 A very important thing you need to know. 
 I have not been in control of my actions lately. 
 sh1t just gets to me, and, well, I leap before I look, you understand? 
 Yeah. 
 You nearly killed the only man I ever loved. 
 That's a f*cking lot to say. 
 And you think I'd wanna kill you. 
 When all I really wanna do is kiss you. 
 Oh, sh1t. f*ck! 
 sh1t. 
 Where's Diamond? 
 He's not here right now. 
 Why do you look so familiar to me? 
 Well, you saved my life once. 
 You let me just call Diamond? 
 I'm sure he'd want to know you're looking for him. 
 Yeah, sure, go ahead. 
 Give him a buzz. 
 Yeah, you see, we can't help ourselves. 
 See, that's the sad f*cking lot of the Powers. 
 It's gonna be your ruin. 
 It's gonna be my ruin. 
 I tried to explain that to Janice year and years and years ago. 
 You used your Powers for good. You wanted to help people. 
 I don't know about all that. 
 Matter of fact, I don't know too much about anything nowadays. 
 Mister SuperShock? 
 I... I have to go. 
 I just remembered who I saw you with. 
 Yeah? Walker. 
 With Diamond? 
 No. 
 No, it was Morrison. 
 That... 
 What... What... 
 What did I... I'm sorry. 
 You're gonna be all right. 
 I'm gonna put it back in. 
 Hey, no photographs today. 
 I'm waiting for somebody. 
 Is it all right if we wait here with you? 
 You know, Walt used to bring his daughters here. 
 And one day he asked me if he could make a cartoon about me. 
 And I said, you know, you already got that little mouse. 
 What do you need me for? 
 You've been around for a long time. 
 Yeah, too long. 
 Some people think. 
 Me especially. 
 You must be tired. 
 Honey, you have no idea. 
 That's why we're here, Sir. 
 To help. 
 How're you gonna do that? 
 We're Powers. 
 We came to say you don't have to fight any more. 
 We're ready to pick up where you left off. 
 If you'll let us. 
 What are you gonna call yourselves? 
 New Unity. 
 "New Unity." 
 Can't you come up with something a little bit more original? 
 We didn't mean any disrespect by it, Sir. 
 We just wanted to honor what the original Unity stood for. 
 What you stood for. 
 Well, you know, I'll say one thing. 
 You got a lot of moxie. 
 I killed Hitler. 
 With these two hands. 
 I stood on top of Mount Saint Helens and stopped the lava flowing until that volcano choked on itself. 
 I have seen things and done things that none of you could ever imagine. 
 And you're gonna put on your flying suits and turn into superheroes... 
 We'd like to give it a try. 
 You know, being a Power, it'll destroy you, eat you up inside, little by little, you start to rot from inside, just like I am right now. 
 The world is better off without Powers, trust me. 
 So... 
 I think you better get out of my way. 
 No. 
 Why, Janice? 
 Stop calling me Janice. 
 Stop, Janice! 
 I won't do it. 
 You're not evil, you're just broken. 
 That's enough, Patrick. 
 Diamond, I've been waiting for you. 
 Did Janice send you? 
 Yeah. 
 Yeah, Janice sent me. 
 She said to say sorry she couldn't make it. 
 Yeah, I was waiting and then these kids showed up and I had to take care of them. 
 I know, right? 
 f*cking young Powers. 
 Always trying to make a name for themselves. 
 Yeah. 
 They wanna fight the top dog and they think they know everything. 
 Like you once. 
 Yeah, sh1t... You couldn't teach me anything, could you? 
 I was a cocky son of a bitch. 
 I think you turned out all right. 
 Yeah. 
 Morrison's done something with Janice, hasn't he? 
 sh1t, man. 
 This all has to end. 
 No, no, no. Patrick! 
 Patrick. Pat... 
 No. No. 
 Patrick. 
 No. 
 No, Patrick. 
 There's no other choice as long as Morrison is on this god-forsaken earth. 
 The apes can't hide him forever. 
 I've tried to be a good steward. 
 I can't protect them from themselves. 
 They all deserve to die. 
 Janice would not want this, man. 
 She's dead. Janice is dead. 
 The apes killed her. 
 They murdered her. 
 They're all gonna die now. 
 I killed her! 
 I'm not Diamond. 
 I'm Morrison. 
 I've been here the whole time. 
 Pretending to be Diamond, so I could get close to everybody you love. 
 See, that's how I killed Cobalt Knight. 
 And it's how I killed Retro Girl. 
 What are you gonna do? 
 How many times have you tried to kill me, and I always come back? 
 I will never... ever... stop coming after you. 
 The only way that this ends is when we're both dead. 
 If that's what it takes. 
 What are you going to do? Fly us both into the sun? 
 Sacrifice yourself? 
 We both know you don't have that in you. 
 And you never did. 
 And you can't stop me any other way. 
 I don't know what Janice ever saw in you. 
 Details are still emerging regarding SuperShock's deadly rampage, but the facts are these. 
 JPL has confirmed SuperShock was the source of the unnatural disaster that occurred earlier today. 
 He attacked and nearly killed Detective Deena Pilgrim of Powers Division. 
 Her partner, Detective Walker, is missing and presumed dead, also at SuperShock's hand. 
 And we anticipate the death toll will only continue to rise. 
 Powers Division still refuses to comment on the mysterious death of Morrison, the criminal mastermind, also known as "The Ghost". 
 Retro Girl lied to us. 
 Our greatest hero was directly responsible for covering up murders committed by another so-called hero, SuperShock. 
 We trusted Retro Girl. 
 We trusted her to keep us safe. 
 Let me be clear. 
 Powers are dangerous. 
 Whatever perceived benefits society may reap, we will sow nothing but our own destruction if we trust them again. 
 Which is why Congress has convened an emergency session to bring Senator Brown's anti-Powers legislation back to the floor. 
 A bill that, if passed, will make the use of powers illegal. 
 This legislation will change the course of history. 
 To which I can only say this. 
 They have my vote. 
 The age of Powers is over. 
 As of today, Retro Girl is truly dead. 
 And in a world without heroes, we must protect ourselves. 
 Walker... 
 IS NOT OVER YET- 
 Interesting, no? 
 They're all interesting. 
 But this one in particular, I think. 
 How long have you been observing him? 
 Ten iterations. 
 I really do think he'd be an ideal candidate. 
 Perhaps. 
 I shall bring it to the full council for further review. 
 Of course. 
 In the meantime, put him through the level two trials. 
 Let's see what he's truly made of. 
 As you wish.
