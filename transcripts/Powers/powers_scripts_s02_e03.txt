 Previously on Powers... 
 Powers individually are Level One or Twos at best, but as a group, as a gang they could be, and have been, real trouble for us. 
 If you're watching us live, a young girl dressed in the classic Retro Girl uniform... 
 No. 
 Is there anything you won't sell? 
 We could use SuperShock now more than ever. 
 I think we ought to stop getting in the middle of their problems and let them handle it themselves. 
 Hell Night is coming tonight. 
 Mayor Robles has announced a city-wide curfew from dusk to dawn. 
 All tactical response teams are on high alert as Los Angeles prepares for the worst. 
 Sources say the simmering tension that erupted yesterday at Retro Girl's funeral was only the tip of a very violent iceberg. 
 Many are desperately overrunning grocery stores while others are fleeing the city, causing havoc on all major freeways. 
 Downtown merchants are preparing for the worst in anticipation of an all-out war between the rival gangs the Quantums and the Hacks. 
 The entire LAPD will be on the first line tonight, but it'll be Powers Division that is expected to be the first line of defense, and we can only hope that they can contain the nefarious forces before Los Angeles goes up in flames. 
 Vegas odds have us dead by dawn, killed in the Powers on Powers crossfire. 
 Just you and me? 
 Whole division. 
 Except Walker. 
 Really? 
 50 to 1 he survives the night. 
 Wouldn't bet against him. 
 Cross wants to see you his office. 
 Walker's been in there for 10 minutes yelling his head off. 
 About the case? 
 Yeah. 
 It's staying closed. 
 Cross tell you that? 
 Just reading the odds. 
 We got bigger fish to fry. 
 f*ck those odds. 
 What's your take on our chances? 
 sh1t storm. 
 All those tribes out there feeling like it's time to work out their issues. 
 Our chances are better if we just let them all kill each other. 
 Those Hacks, Quantums, whoever else f*ck needs to settle a score. 
 Interesting. 
 To hell with everyone else. 
 Pretty much. 
 For the battle, telling everyone to stay inside. 
 The evidence is on your desk! 
 Yes, come in. 
 Good morning. 
 It's for sh1t, actually. 
 Almost break my hand getting him the evidence... 
 Close the door. 
 He won't reopen the case. 
 You've made your argument. 
 Very cogent. 
 We haven't even begun, okay? 
 You have said enough! 
 Enough! 
 I have listened. 
 And... Bottom line is, it's against my better judgment. But... I'm taking your advice and reopening the Retro case. 
 No, no, no. 
 You have to reopen it. 
 The Hack's Krispin mask throws out every assumption. 
 Nobody has nailed the hard drives he has in his head. 
 So crack them. 
 What? 
 What part of "the case is being reopened" are you not understanding? 
 You're running it. 
 You're with him. 
 No one else is on this. 
 No one else knows what you're doing, and you keep it that way. 
 Neither of you are on call for whatever happens tonight unless absolutely necessary. 
 Define "necessary." 
 Armageddon. 
 Dig into the Hack. 
 Find out how deep it goes. 
 You do whatever you need to do, but not here someplace else. 
 Lange gets nothing. 
 The media get nothing. 
 You bring this to me first. 
 Is everything okay? 
 Get out. 
 Thank you. 
 You all right? 
 He said thank you. 
 Wonders will not cease. 
 Hang on one second. 
 Case still closed, right? 
 You should be playing the horses. 
 Didn't I tell you? 
 You're a genius. 
 From TUSUBTITULO.com What happened yesterday wasn't just a shameful display of disrespect and disregard for common decency. 
 It was validation for those people still concerned that my legislation isn't necessary. 
 It is. 
 Our survival depends on it. 
 And I hope... I pray that the rumors I'm hearing about further violence are just that. 
 Not if I can help it. 
 New Retro Girl. 
 What do we know? 
 Still digging. 
 She was practically in the cops' laps when Wolfe died. 
 Ask someone in Powers Division. 
 Ask Walker. 
 I've already called five times. 
 How do you ambush someone with a phone call? 
 Get your ass down there. Get aggressive. 
 With respect, Terry, my ass is gonna be on the street tonight. 
 It's not every day you get to see a city tear itself apart. 
 If that really happens. 
 The funeral riot pretty much took the wind out of everyone's sails. 
 Then it's our job to whip up a good nor'easter. 
 God, you're one scary... 
 Maybe you should come out there with me. 
 It would give it... 
 f*ck that. 
 I'm not being humiliated again on camera by some psycho cop. 
 Yeah, Walker got you good. 
 Have fun tonight, Glantz. 
 Don't get yourself killed. 
 But if you do, make sure it's on camera. 
 Here, I got it. 
 Thanks. 
 Yeah. 
 You need help with any enhanced interrogation foxtrot in there? 
 Sorry. 
 Invitation-only dance, my friend. 
 You should go. 
 Really, you don't want your hands dirty on this one. 
 It ain't exactly legal. 
 Cross said, "Do what you need to do." 
 This is a gray area. 
 And by gray area, I assume you mean that fucktard's brain. 
 Coffee? 
 Yeah. 
 Walker? 
 No. 
 Sure? 
 I got nothing to say. 
 Well... See, the thing is... 
 We got you on a Quantum slaughter, and you're looking really good for Retro Girl's murder. 
 No, that's not me, man. 
 No. 
 No? 
 Took the Drainer, though. 
 Yeah, I got paid for that. 
 But you're not putting Retro Girl on me! 
 Come on, that's somebody else. 
 I'm not crazy. 
 f*cking batshit. 
 Who, then? 
 Who did Retro Girl? 
 Besides you? 
 I don't know. 
 Maybe half the Hero League for all I know. 
 m*therf*cker. 
 Remember the question?! 
 I had no idea that sh1t was gonna go down! 
 I didn't. 
 Fucker! Say her name one more f*cking time. 
 I dare you, m*therf*cker. 
 Say the f*cking name! 
 Even if I could, I can't tell you anything, 'cause I don't know anything. 
 Where'd the money come from? 
 Who bankrolled you? 
 I don't know. 
 Well, he doesn't know. 
 Is it this one? 
 That's one's spicy. 
 I don't know anything! 
 How spicy? 
 On the Scoville scale, you're looking just this side of a Carolina Reaper. 
 Walker! Wal... 
 Walker, here. 
 Come on, take the coffee. 
 I'm okay, it's just... 
 Take the coffee. 
 Just dial it back. 
 If you know anything, now's really the time. 
 You might want to talk. 
 Just saying. 
 Seems like we got off on a bad footing. 
 But he's gonna talk now. 
 Open up his head. 
 Let's see what's in it. 
 Stay out of my head! 
 Too late. 
 It's gonna take my friend here about two f*cking seconds to download those files and decrypt them. 
 And it is gonna hurt. 
 Unless you talk. 
 Here we go. 
 Okay, okay! 
 Okay. 
 So, who's the money? 
 I got pinged. 
 I don't know by who. 
 I couldn't track it down. There were too many proxies. 
 Sent a text message with an offer. 
 Cash for his Drainer. 
 Break into this shit-box, get it, leave it someplace for pick-up. 
 How did you get past security? 
 Oh, please. 
 Hey! 
 Stay with me. 
 The mask, the face. 
 Why that one? 
 Money sent a file. 
 Wanted it custom. 
 I don't know who that guy is. 
 I don't care. 
 Where'd you leave the Drainer? 
 Parking garage. Pershing Square. B level. 
 Behind this thing up against the wall. 
 B-44. 
 Space B-44. 
 Okay, who picked it up? 
 I... was already gone. 
 I don't know. 
 No, no. 
 Tell me... 
 No, I, I don't know. 
 We can check it out. 
 Who picked it up? 
 Do you want me to check it out? 
 We both will. 
 Wait, wait, guys. 
 Harley, what the f*ck is this? 
 Is he doing that? 
 No, it's not in his head. 
 It... It's in his cloud. This guy's wireless. 
 No, it's coming from the cloud. 
 The signals are coming down, and they're blocking him. 
 They've stopped. 
 Okay, download them, Harley. 
 Harley, f*cking download them! 
 There's some kind of failsafe here. They're stopping. 
 Shut him down! 
 sh1t! 
 What the f*ck, man? 
 Oh, sh1t! 
 f*ck! 
 The f*ck, Harley? 
 He crashed. 
 Ma'am, how are you prepping? 
 Well, like, with an earthquake or a storm or something, you know how to prepare, but how do you prepare for who knows how many freaks throwing cars or tanks at you, or flying through buildings, or who knows what else? 
 Let them f*cking work it out. 
 Hopefully they'll kill themselves in the process. 
 You know, the world would be a better place without these freaks. 
 Correspondence with other major metropolitan centers seems to suggest that Los Angeles, the de facto home of Retro Girl, might be in for a rougher time tonight, and there's no guarantee that the trouble will end come morning. 
 I see napkins, pens, f*cking gum wrapper no gum. 
 Yeah, you find gum in there, I'm not sure I'd chew it. 
 Taco sauce. 
 How long has this been in here? 
 Well, at least it'll get the taste of singed hair out of your mouth. 
 And give me E.coli. 
 It's the safest thing in there. 
 That stuff's got a shelf life of a Twinkie. 
 Which is why you should get rid of it, like a normal person. 
 Why the hell are you hanging on to this? 
 It was Brian's. 
 My former partner. 
 Yeah. 
 Yeah. 
 Whole goddamn family wiped off the face of the map. 
 I promised Brian, "If anything ever happens to you, I'll take care of Krispin." 
 You are. 
 You did. 
 He's dead. 
 That is not your fault. 
 Kid calls me scared out of his mind. 
 In way over his head in some f*cked up sh1t asked for my help. 
 Yeah, that's right. That kid was way in over his head, and, and you knew the truth of that. 
 You were the only one. 
 Lot of good it did him. 
 You were that kid's best chance at survival, and he knew it. 
 That's why he called you. 
 Because with my training, Cross's training... 
 Hell, the entire department. 
 We all believed that Krispin killed Retro Girl. 
 Every last one of us. 
 We were wrong. 
 I, I was... I was wrong. 
 Yeah, you just didn't know him like I did. 
 I knew in my gut that the kid didn't have it in him. 
 Your gut has been right thus far. 
 My gut hasn't solved the case. 
 No, it hasn't. 
 But whoever's behind this sh1t is one dangerous m*therf*cker, and they're good at hiding. 
 I'm gonna keep digging all the way down, till I find the knife and whoever used it to cut her throat. 
 I think it's a good thing. 
 Separate the wheat from the chaff. 
 We can lose clients. 
 Powers could be killed out there tonight. 
 We need to give our clients body cameras. 
 Get all the video rights together. 
 Speaking of rights, don't we own this look? 
 Right? 
 I mean, this likeness is trademarked. 
 But to impersonate RG because she's dead? 
 _ 
 He's right. 
 If we don't defend our IP, then this whole thing... 
 That's the wheat. 
 The fact that she's wearing RG's outfit only makes it better. 
 This ain't like Elvis impersonators, Craig. 
 This isn't parody or fair use. 
 This is... 
 No, this is... This is a young woman inspired by her hero. 
 She's... mourning her hero by adopting her colors, by, by picking up her fallen banner in the field of battle and carrying that thing into a whirlwind of, of... 
 Bullshit? 
 I was gonna say financial opportunity. 
 That look is not ours. 
 It's, it's theirs. 
 It's... It's what we sold to them. 
 And they love it. 
 No, this new Retro Girl is... She's a godsend. 
 She is a Phoenix from the ashes. 
 Right? And she should be here under this roof and wrung out of every single cent that we can squeeze out of her heartbreaking homage to a hero she clearly loved. 
 What if she's a nutjob? 
 They're all nutjobs. 
 Powers Davison must know who she is. 
 No, no cops. 
 We put our people on the street tonight and try to catch her in action. 
 Pitch her on the spot. 
 It's gonna be dangerous out there. 
 If you're gonna separate wheat from chaff, you got to harvest it, right? 
 If you had to hide something, this would be the place. 
 f*ck. 
 f*ck me. 
 No cameras. 
 No. 
 None in the stairwell, either. 
 No. 
 Easy in and out. 
 You think this guy's our killer? 
 I think that even if he didn't hold the knife, he had the means to render Janice vulnerable. 
 That makes him just as guilty in my book. 
 Oh, sh1t. It's Cross. 
 You think he knows we fried the Hack? 
 Wasn't our fault. 
 Sure, blame the shoddy Internet connection. 
 Yeah? 
 Night of the murder, we got a bombed-out Honda Civic on Olympic. 
 No injuries, no bodies. 
 Just the car. 
 Towed to impound. Held till we could process it. 
 And? 
 We processed it. 
 Bomb was in the trunk, placed in the well under the spare tire. 
 So it was hidden? 
 Well, if you opened the trunk, you wouldn't have seen it. 
 So it was hidden. 
 What else was in the car? 
 Not much. 
 A couple textbooks, the notebook. 
 And prints? 
 Pulled a partial off the passenger door handle. 
 It's the killer's. 
 Krispin Stockley? 
 Yeah. 
 Who owns the car? 
 It's not Krispin's car? 
 No. 
 The DMV doesn't have it registered. 
 The VIN puts it at a used car lot in Fresno six months ago, but... they're out of business, and their sales records are for sh1t. 
 Well, the door's not blown. 
 What? 
 Both front doors still intact. 
 Must've been open at the time of the blast. 
 So? 
 So, his prints are on the passenger side. 
 He wasn't driving. 
 And it's not here. 
 What? 
 Krispin's phone. 
 It was on his body. 
 No, it wasn't. 
 That was his mother's phone. 
 Did you... 
 If there was a phone in that car, we would've found it. 
 Okay, look. 
 The blast. Where on Olympic? 
 Oh, sh1t. 
 Thank you. 
 Yeah? 
 So I had a little help and made an interesting discovery. 
 The Hack didn't just crash. 
 He was nuked remotely. 
 A signal came through the cloud and basically took a data dump into the freak's brain. 
 He was murdered? 
 In a word. Someone did not want him talking. 
 Do you know where the signal came from? 
 I'm trying to track that down now. 
 There's spoofs and proxies, but we'll get it. 
 Who's we? 
 Look, I'm really good at this stuff, but even I need help sometimes. 
 When I know who nuked him, you will. 
 
 
 
 We found a phone. I think it's Krispin's. 
 Need you to ping some cell towers let us know where it's been. 
 Okay, what's so important? 
 I didn't think you'd actually show. 
 Do you want something to eat? I'm buying. 
 No, I'm not gonna stay that long. 
 You said something about me being in danger. 
 Danger from what? 
 Getting right to it. Okay. 
 The danger of being misrepresented. 
 Misrepresented? 
 What, we're talking about agencies and public relations people? 
 No, I'm talking about you. 
 I think you need to slow down. 
 That thing at the funeral, you jumping in, going full superhero? 
 Yeah, there was trouble. 
 And you certainly made an entrance. 
 I had to. 
 Did you? 
 Really? I mean... You rushing in there, just, "Boom, here I am, world." 
 It's gonna force public opinion. 
 The media's gonna lock that opinion down, good or bad. 
 Trust me, the media loves bad. 
 There goes your narrative. 
 My narrative? 
 Your image. 
 Pardon the pun, but... Right now it's a bit retro. 
 Everything Retro Girl lived for is just as valid now as it ever was... 
 Cut the sh1t. 
 You are piggybacking on a successful brand, hoping to dodge dues-paying. 
 Take a moment and figure out your real identity. 
 Who are you, other than an invincible and unimaginative ghoul? 
 Well, at least I'm not an ass-kicked has-been. 
 Look. 
 You only get one chance to make a first impression. 
 You might have made yours yesterday at the funeral. 
 You know, battling babe at the burial grounds. 
 But if tonight... 
 I plan on making a few more impressions. 
 You looking for trouble? 
 Calista, I think... 
 I don't give a sh1t what you or anyone else thinks. 
 See you around. 
 Calista, come on, wait. 
 Cal... 
 Next time, go through the barricade. 
 It was two city buses, Nicole. 
 Where are we? 
 Not where the action is. 
 Get your gear. 
 Well, we're not leaving the van. 
 The hell we can. 
 I'm not gonna... - Listen, I'm responsible for all this stuff. 
 Wait. 
 This could be good. 
 This is Colossal Fun. 
 Toy company. 
 Colossal Fun. 
 They make all the Powers action figures. 
 Help me with this. 
 What are we doing? 
 We're just helping things along. 
 Guys, give me a hand. 
 Come on, lift. 
 Now what? 
 The Colossal Fun, Inc. building is the closest thing to a Temple of the Gods here in Los Angeles. 
 And it's being sacked. 
 Is the fury a response to pent-up resentment, a reaction of years of perceived subjugation? 
 Or do they just want some souvenirs of Hell Night? 
 It might be both, but what is definite is that this night is just beginning. 
 Powers Division, sir. 
 A couple questions. 
 Really, can't this wait? 
 Haven't you been watching the news? 
 Just... 
 Look at the picture. 
 What makes you think... 
 His phone was traced to this area. 
 Was he here? 
 Yeah, I guess. 
 Stayed a couple days. 
 He wasn't alone. 
 Your video. 
 We're gonna need the files. 
 If you've got family to protect, you should go. 
 Mom and little sister are in Bakersfield staying with friends. 
 Ex-Army Rangers. It's cool. 
 Electromagnets, buddy. 
 It's the way of the future. 
 Straps and buckles are two last centuries ago. 
 If I lose power, then my pants fall down. 
 Link them to your sinoatrial node. 
 Electric signals, your heart's natural pacemaker. 
 As long as it beats, you stay armored. 
 But if they kill me, my pants still fall down. 
 Dude, at that point you'll be dead and not giving any f*cks. 
 Fantastic. 
 You're welcome. 
 f*cking fantastic. 
 Yeah? 
 Hey, did Krispin's phone pay off? 
 Yes. 
 The kid has a girlfriend. 
 Did you get her? 
 No. You got the guy who killed the Hack? 
 No, but his computer's in LA. 
 Is it online? 
 Not yet. 
 When it is... I'll be able to tell you where to get him. 
 Are you rolling? 
 I'm not getting any closer. 
 But we need to get this. 
 Yeah. You get it. 
 No! 
 I'm the f*ck out. 
 I was able to track the MAC address to a laptop purchased eight months ago in Santa Monica. 
 Do you have a buyer? 
 Yes. We do. 
 Martinez just sent a photo from her driver's license. 
 Yep, that's her. 
 What's her name? 
 Marigold Wygant. 
 No criminal record. 
 Big social media presence. 
 Deep into the anti-Powers movement. 
 Has she been online? 
 Not since the signal was beamed into that Hack's head. 
 She logs on again... 
 I'll call you. Don't worry. 
 Deep enough to kill Retro Girl? 
 Million dollar question. 
 You want me to pick this up? 
 You okay? 
 I should be out there. 
 We're doing good sh1t. 
 Not out there. 
 I used to be making a difference. 
 You still are. 
 The Drainer. 
 Drainer helped murder one of the best saviors this world has ever known. 
 Dude, come on. 
 Triphammer's as dead as Retro Girl. 
 But Retro Girl ain't dead. 
 Not with the new girl picking up the ball and running with it. 
 You got me running like a rocket-mounted cheetah, man. 
 Hell... I could be the... 
 The Flying Hammer. 
 Nah, the... Hey, that sh1t won't fit you. 
 So? 
 Jeez. 
 We take it in a little. 
 Let it out, you mean. 
 Whatever fits. 
 Oh, did I step on your moment? 
 Get off my roof. 
 Not on it. 
 And how is this your roof, exactly? 
 Does the stolen outfit come with its own real estate? 
 Hold on, please. 
 Permission to come aboard? 
 What? 
 I just want to make sure you're gonna be okay. 
 I'll be fine. 
 It might be a good idea if we work together tonight. 
 Good for who? 
 No offense... 
 Means I'm going to be offended. 
 You're a rookie here. 
 You're heading into the World Series of urban warfare. 
 It could be a little overwhelming. 
 I don't think so. 
 Do you even know your limitations... 
 What your weakness is? 
 Assuming you only have one? 
 I have her powers. 
 And what was her weakness? 
 She didn't have any. 
 She's dead. 
 We can help each other. 
 No. 
 Three LAPD uniforms just got hit by a group of Lightning Spitters down on Spring Street. 
 I know you said I should head to Figueroa, but now I'm thinking... I don't know. 
 Get your ass down to Spring Street and wait for backup. 
 Okay. 
 Who've you got down there? 
 Nearest unit's on Boyd. 
 All the assholes out there tonight, it's gonna take them an hour to get there. 
 No, leave... Leave the unit on Boyd. 
 Send Walker and Pilgrim. The three of us will hold the line, try to keep things from spreading. 
 Walker and Pilgrim are otherwise engaged. 
 On this sh1t or other sh1t? 
 They're working a lead. 
 On what? 
 On not your problem. 
 Go. 
 She said you didn't reopen the case. 
 As far as you're concerned, I didn't. 
 All due respect, Commander, but if they're out there in the middle of all this sh1t working the Retro Girl case, I guarantee you. 
 Walker's not gonna be watching her back like he should. 
 I appreciate your concern for Detective Pilgrim. 
 She can handle herself. 
 I'll grab my gear. 
 You're missing the fun. 
 We like your car. 
 Give me the keys. 
 Too slow. 
 Hey, Sparky. 
 Think it's time you boys unplugged. 
 You're grounded. 
 Seriously? 
 Just stating the obvious. 
 What are you doing? 
 You got a car? 
 Craig? 
 Craig, car. 
 Do you have one? 
 Right here! 
 Let's go. 
 Let's go. 
 Hello? 
 What? 
 The girl's online. 
 f*ck. 
 Hey, hey, hey. 
 I need your car. 
 What? 
 What? What? 
 Out, I need your car! 
 Deena, get rid of him. 
 Well, where are you going? 
 What the f*ck? 
 Okay... 
 No. 
 Craig, listen to me. 
 I need you to get the f*ck home, okay? 
 Hey! 
 Drop that! 
 Hey, stop it! 
 Put it down! 
 I'm cool. 
 I'm not. 
 Drop it. 
 You will be. 
 Holy sh1t. 
 You okay? 
 Yeah. 
 All right, where did Walker go? 
 He's on a thing. 
 We should get out of here. 
 You want to get off me, maybe? 
 Okay. 
 No, no, no. Here, here. 
 sh1t. sh1t. 
 Despite the best efforts of the LAPD and Powers Division, authorities have lost control over much of downtown. 
 The Quantums and the Hacks have taken over the city. 
 Don't you dare f*ck up now. 
 Maybe this wasn't such a good idea. 
 Oh, sh1t. 
 She's f*cked. 
 Just... Just hang on a minute. 
 Let's see if she can... If she can... 
 Or not. 
 Zora, go. 
 Deena. 
 Hey, hey. Back up. 
 Is it just us? 
 I think everyone else is busy. 
 Where's Walker? 
 Busy. 
 Excuse me. I'm sorry. 
 This was a fantastic idea. 
 It really was. 
 Incoming! 
 I'm here to help. 
 I feel better. 
 We can stop this. We can do it. 
 Or die trying. 
 Deena, this was your idea. 
 They are not stopping. 
 Calista, watch out! 
 Marigold? 
 Hey! 
 This isn't what you think. 
 What am I thinking? 
 That I did this. 
 That I made all of this happen. 
 That you killed Retro Girl and Krispin. 
 No! 
 No. 
 Was he supposed to die in the car? 
 Both. 
 So what, you escaped, and then you had to hang him make it look like a suicide? 
 They want me dead, too. 
 I want you dead! 
 Listen to me! 
 He's coming. 
 What's this? Is this how you killed the Hack? 
 Sent out the signal that blew him up... 
 I don't know what you're talking about. 
 On your little laptop? 
 He's gonna kill me. Please, I just want to go home. 
 You're good. 
 I was played. 
 We both were. 
 I mean, someone online, someone I thought I could trust. 
 We need to go. He's here. 
 Hey, hey, hey, no. 
 Oh, my God. 
 SuperShock! 
 And Retro Girl. 
 This must stop! 
 Or we'll make it stop for you. 
 We will... 
 Make it all stop! 
 You understand? 
 Am I clear? 
 Hey, kiddo. 
 It's nice to see you again. 
 It's a good outfit. 
 f*cking... 
 Holy f*ck, Terry. Seriously, holy f*ck. 
 Nicole, we're live on the air. 
 We have to go. 
 We're not going anywhere until you tell me who. 
 We have to go. 
 Who is coming?! 
 We were just trying to get people to wake up, that's all. 
 They're awake, all right? 
 They're awake! 
 From TUSUBTITULO.com Motherfucking SuperShock. 
 Didn't have to lift a goddamn finger. 
 That's power. 
 What? 
 Power. 
 It's pure power. 
 Does that make you hot? 
 Oh, shut the f*ck up and drive. 
 We have paperwork, and I'm hungry. 
 Hungry for some SuperCock. 
 Oh, sh1t. 
 I saw you out there. 
 Saw me what? 
 Staring at his package. 
 f*ck you. Project much? 
 f*ck you. Deflect much? 
 Why the f*ck were you looking at me anyway? 
 As your partner, I got to keep you safe. 
 Okay. 
 When you start putting yourself in danger like that. 
 Walker is my partner. 
 Okay, you know what I meant. 
 And I wasn't in danger. 
 What the f*ck was tonight? 
 Where was Walker? 
 Out chasing some bullshit clue, leaving you in the street, alone. 
 I was... I was not looking at SuperShock. 
 I was looking at you. Doing my job. 
 Thank you. 
 And looking at you. 
 Hey, hey. 
 Stupid.
