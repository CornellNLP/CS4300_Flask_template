 There was a woman. She lived in this car with a kid. She got me into some small-time robberies to pay for the drugs. The reason I stayed was because of that kid. I called her Smurf. 
 Baz : My mark knows the ins and outs of the base. 
 Wait, your mark? 
 Yeah, Paul. 
 (GLASS BREAKS) 
 There is a ton of cash on that base. 
 Deran : This is a big job. 
 We're taking a lot of risks. 
 (LIQUID BUBBLING) 
 Smurf : What's your name, dude? 
 I'm Vin. 
 Pope : Did you see Lucy while you were there? 
 How's Cath? 
 Smurf : I hadn't seen Cath in weeks, and then she shows up, steals 10 grand from behind the dryer, and disappears. 
 Smurf : She's betrayed you over and over, and now she's betraying your family. 
 Are you asking me to sleep with a 17-year-old kid? 
 Of course not. That would be illegal. 
 Alexa tells me you have reason to believe your grandmother and your uncles might be planning another crime. 
 You're gonna put on that wire, find out what they're planning, when they're planning to do it, and we're gonna take 'em down. 
 No.

 Sorry about breakfast, baby. Lena was up all night. 
 Yeah, I-I heard. 
 So, Craig tells me you're bangin' your teacher. 
 Is that true? 
 You know, I am not interested in every detail of your s*x life, but this is one you definitely should've told me. 
 The last thing we need is some bullshit at your school. 
 No, she, um... She wouldn't say anything. 
 Or she'd lose her job. 
 You're gonna have to break it off. 
 Okay, baby? And I'm not asking. 
 Baz : Because you're her best friend, and she hasn't been back in three days, that's why. 
 No. No. 
 No, no one saw anything. I told you. 
 (LAUGHS) 
 What the hell is that supposed to mean? 
 Ah. 
 We did not get in a fight, Krystal! 
 Well, did Cath say we did? 
 'Cause I'm telling you, I swear to God, if there's something you're not telling me... 
 No, please, don't hang up. Hey, Krystal, do... 
 (LAWN MOWER RUNNING IN DISTANCE) 
 She still hasn't picked up her paycheck at the bar. 
 (GRUNTS) 
 Did you try calling her again? 
 No, her voicemail's full. 
 I don't get it. 
 No credit card hits, not even for gas. 
 Well, if she took Smurf's money like she... 
 Smurf's full of sh1t, okay? 
 Yeah. 
 Just say it. 
 This is somehow my fault, isn't it? 
 I know that's what you're thinking. 
 That's not what I'm thinking.

 Where you going? 
 I'm going to school. 
 Get your ass back in that house in case the money shows up. 
 Look, if I stay in the house all day, someone's gonna get suspicious. 
 I said I'd text you when something happens, and I will. 
 Yeah. That was three days ago. 
 Well, I don't know what the holdup is. 
 We've been very understanding. 
 When you begged us not to wear the wire, 'cause she's walking in on you all the time, all that hanging out by the pool. 
 Did we force you? 
 No. 
 We're trying to keep you safe. 
 But if you're lying to us, trying to figure a way out of doing the right thing, you will regret it for the rest of your life. 
 I'll text you. 
 Okay. 
 Any? 
 No. 
 What about Craig and Deran? 
 (LAUGHS) 
 That's it, huh? Straight to business? 
 Cath goes AWOL. 
 Are we supposed to forget about our money? 
 It'll move. 
 So you said. 
 Two days ago. 
 It's a normal delay. It'll move. 
 And what if it doesn't move? 
 Do you have a Plan B? 
 I'm gonna talk to Lena again. 
 What? No, you are not! 
 (SIGHS) 
 Okay, you took a bath. Then Mommy did book time. 
 But after she left the room, are you sure no one came over? 
 Maybe... Maybe you heard Mommy on the phone? 
 I fell asleep. 
 Nothing woke you up? Think hard. 
 Did it feel like a dream? 
 What did you dream? 
 I was in Mommy's car. 
 Car. Good. 
 Okay, okay, okay. 
 Where were you going? 
 A man was driving. 
 Who? Do you remember who? 
 No? What about his voice? 
 Can you hear his voice? 
 Lena, where were you going? Mommy wasn't there. 
 What do you mean she wasn't there?! 
 Come on, Lena, think! 
 Baz. That's enough. 
 (SIGHS) 
 Come here, sweetie. Come here. 
 You know what I have? 
 I have a secret hiding place for cookies. 
 And if you can find it, I'll let you have as many as you want, okay?

 You gonna break the screen. Please stop. 
 I'm trying to get warm. 
 I caught a chill sleeping in this shit-box last night. 
 (SIGHS) 
 Well, maybe Baz is wrong about all this, and the money never moves. 
 I mean, what if the military just... 
 You know, what if they don't recycle the fry grease? 
 Maybe they just dump it in the ocean or something. 
 You hear about them paying like 400 bucks for a hammer? 
 God damn it! 
 Maybe you and me could run for Congress, clean it all up. 
 Bet Smurf would help us buy some votes. 
 Or not. 
 Jesus, what are you doing? 
 Well, I can't just sit here. 
 Don't you think it's a bad idea to get amped? 
 You know, while we're just sitting here? 
 (SNORTS) 
 How dare you inflict your bullshit on that child. 
 Where is she? 
 She's outside coloring. 
 Maybe when you get your head out of your ass, you could join her, act like a dad. 
 Thanks for the parenting advice, Smurf. 
 Cath packed a bag, and she took her passport. 
 Now, what is it you're not seeing? 
 Could you do me a favor and just stay out of this, please? 
 Maybe she found out about Lucy. 
 Maybe she always knew and finally she just said, "Screw it. 
 I'll give him a taste of his own medicine." 
 If Cath was stepping out of me, she wouldn't leave Lena alone in the house. 
 She wouldn't do it, not ever! 
 Okay, baby. She's not stepping out on you. 
 She's gone for good. 
 She wanted a new life. 
 She took 10K from behind the dryer. 
 Did you see her take the money? 
 Jesus, baby. Give me a break. 
 I'll give you a break. What about Deran and Craig? 
 No, they could never take it. They wouldn't do that. 
 Or maybe you took it, Smurf. 
 Watch it, Barry. 
 You know, you can drop the bullshit. 
 You hate Cath. 
 You've been trying to get rid of her for years. 
 And I don't give a sh1t what you think. 
 I know something happened. 
 She wouldn't leave. Not without Lena. 
 Uh! 
 I thought Craig was the one known for drinking before noon. 
 (WATER RUNNING) 
 She all right? 
 No. 
 (WATER SHUTS OFF) 
 Doesn't help her father's an asshole. 
 I'm out of moves here, man. 
 I mean, I don't know what to do. What am I supposed to do? 
 I don't know. 
 That's the money we gave Vin. How do you have that? 
 The job was going down. 
 I couldn't let you lose your focus. 
 How'd you get it, Smurf? 
 He jumped the gate. He was drunk, saying that he didn't want to be paid off like some whore. 
 And you didn't tell us? 
 Obviously, I thought I handled it. 
 Well, what did he say? 
 He didn't say anything, just a river of sh1t out of his mouth. 
 Did he threaten Cath? 
 He threatened all of us. 
 What did he say about Cath?! 
 He said you thought he'd bend over like a whore? 
 Wait till you see what he does to your wife. 
 Jesus Christ. 
 I'm scared, Alexa. 
 You know, I... 
 I think their plan's still on track, but I can't be sure. 
 Yates told you to have s*x with me, didn't she? 
 So you'd get me to talk. 
 And if you did, you'd walk away from your drug charge, right? 
 Don't lie to me. 
 Yes. 
 I'm sorry. 
 But now that you don't... 
 Is this real? 
 You know, it feels real. I might just be crazy. 
 No. No. 
 No, you're not crazy. 
 You're not. 
 (INTERCOM RINGS) 
 (BEEPS) 
 What are you doing here? 
 I need to talk to Baz. 
 Baz isn't here. 
 Yeah, well, he's ignoring my calls. 
 Because he's not a moron. 
 Now, if you're here to tell me why our money hasn't moved, let's have it. 
 Well, the pickup was scheduled a couple days ago, but there's been a little delay. 
 How long? 
 That depends. I'm the one that delayed it. 
 Now, look. I've got a lot at stake here. 
 I'm not saying you don't, Janine, but, I mean, honestly, could you have done this without me? 
 I don't think so. 
 So I want a bigger cut. 
 I want $150,000, not $100,000. 
 And I'm not trying to gouge you. 
 Really, I mean, I just want to be fair. 
 I want to feel respected. 
 So 150K. 
 And that pickup happens ASAP.

 Hmm? Never. 
 You know, maybe Cath taking off has its benefits. 
 Yeah, what's up with that?

 Can't be that.

 See, I'm only 17. My mom just died. 
 Alexa was my teacher. I thought I could trust her.

 She'd beg you to leave. 
 She cried and, oh, man, you'd just do anything, even offer to score for her, just so you could get what you wanted. 
 But you never got it, did you?
