 Manny'd be glad you finally made it. 
  His memory was going, so his doctor told him to record sh1t into one of those mini tape recorders. 
  Baz: Don't think of it as a church. 
  It is a church. 
  Craig, they are printing money. 
  I can't breathe. 
  Baz: What are you doing?! 
  I told you that I didn't wanna do this job! 
  Looks like you got the job. 
  Amy: I teach a Bible study. 
  You should come sometime. 
  Come on in. 
  I was in prison. 
  The only person those boys hate more than me... 
  is you. 
  I trained you, Baz. 
  You are me. 
  Oh! 
  Oh, God! 
  Today was fun, man, but I'm still not taking your sh1t. 
  I'm taking your place in the duct. 
  For a higher cut? 
  I told you. 
  I'm not Smurf. 
  Any idiot with a gun can pull a job. 
  The ones that last are the ones that know what to do with the money once they get it. 
  I wanna learn.
