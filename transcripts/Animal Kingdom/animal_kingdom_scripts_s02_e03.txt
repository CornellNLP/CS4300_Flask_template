   Uh, temporary one with the lease. 
   But I'm getting the real one tomorrow. 
   - I have an interview, so... 
  - It's a shitload of red tape.

   Well, I-I think the most important part is... 
   is the first part. 
  God is faithful. 
  Right? 
   Because no matter what we do even when we stop listening,  - He's there. 
  - WOMAN: Praise God. 
   - Right. 
  Right. 
  So His love is unconditional. 
  - Exactly. 
   - Yes. 
  - That's not the point of the verse. 
   What do you think it is, Andrew? 
   The end part. 
   God is faithful. 
   He will not let you be tried beyond what you are able to bear  but with the trial will also provide a way out,  so that you may be able to endure it. 
   That's the part that matters... 
   how we can bear anything if we have to. 
   Right. 
  Because he loves you. 
  So I-I guess we're both right. 
   It doesn't say that. 
   It just says He'll get you through. 
   The beauty of the Gospel is the meaning can be clear  - to each of us... 
  - WOMAN: That's right. 
   - ...in a very different way. 
  - Yes. 
  Amen. 
   - Yeah.
