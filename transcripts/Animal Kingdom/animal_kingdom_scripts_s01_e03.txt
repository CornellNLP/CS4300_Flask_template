 Are those for Pope? 
 You liked it, too. 
 Have you told Baz? 
 Come on, this guy tried to take my wallet! 
 [Grunting] 
 [Gunshot, glass shatters] 
 Man : If you need to go to Mexico, you got to go. iRápido, rápido, rápido! 
 What the hell are you doing?!

 [Gulls crying] 
 You gonna eat that thing? 
 Nah. 
 Sharks piss through their skin. 
 Tastes like bleach. 
 What do you want? 
 [Gull cries] 
 Maybe I missed your ugly face. 
 Got used to seeing it the past couple years. 
 Buddy of mine worked construction on a strip mall in San Marcos. 
 Cut all sorts of corners to save money. 
 Put up a couple flimsy walls. 
 There's a landscaping business in the back. 
 They pay everybody on Saturdays, mostly illegals, all cash. 
 I scouted it. It's at least 10 grand if you catch 'em on a regular week. 
 We go in at lunch. 
 Use a hammer on the Sheetrock, tin snips on the beams. 
 Only thing between us and that safe's a sh1t load of cheap insulation. 
 I've been in 11 years, man. 
 Some of us gotta work to live. 
 [Gull chirps] 
 Oh, I-I get it. 
 Wife's got you playing house. 
 Parole agent's coming around. 
 I'm not looking to take any risks yet. 
 I wouldn't either. Ass like that. 
 How's the baby? 
 Lisa. 
 Lena. 
 She's getting big. 
 Not a baby anymore. 
 Invite me over sometime for dinner. 
 I'm great with kids. Catherine will love me. 
 When you get ready to work again, think of me, okay? 
 You owe me. 
 [Gulls crying] 
 What time is it? 
 sh1t! Why didn't you wake me up? 
 Sorry. I must have fell asleep. 
 You gotta get out of here. Come on, get up. 
 My dad'll sh1t a brick. 
 All right. 
 [Tune plays, abruptly stops] 
 [Dog barks] 
 [Tires screech] 
 Good morning, J. 
 We were studying for physics. 
 You spent the night in my house? 
 We fell asleep. It was an accident. 
 I think I've been fair. 
 I know you're going through a lot right now, but this is unacceptable. 
 I can't have you sleeping here. 
 Do you understand me? 
 Yeah. I'm sorry. 
 Wait a second. 
 How is she doing? 
 She doesn't really talk to me. 
 I know she talks to you. 
 She seems fine. 
 Go on. Get out of here. 
 I don't want you here past 10:00. 
 Do you understand? 
 [Moaning] 
 [Cellphone ringing] 
 Mirame. 
 [Ringing continues] 
 [Moaning continues] 
 I have to get it. I have to get it. 
 No. 
 I have to. I have to. 
 Yeah? 
 Yeah, it's me. Okay, one sec, one sec, one sec. 
 [Sighing] 
 Yeah. It's me. 
 [Door closes] 
 [Sighs] 
 [Television chatter] 
 Janine : Late night? 
 I'm sorry. I, uh, I fell asleep at Nicky's. 
 Don't be sorry. It's not a prison. 
 You come and go as you please. 
 Is Baz back? 
 No. Not yet. 
 Catherine generously allowed me to babysit while she runs some errands. 
 The boys will be back tonight. 
 Craig's a lot better. 
 I'm gonna make ribs. Think you'll be here? 
 Yeah. 
 That's good. 
 Hey, so, um, you and Nicky are having s*x? 
 Uh... 
 You don't have to be embarrassed. 
 She's a beautiful girl. 
 Does she know what you like? 
 What? 
 Does she satisfy you? 
 Yeah, I think so. 
 Just make sure she knows what you need. 
 You know, there are some girls that like to be told what to do. 
 I can't tell you the number of times my boys have gotten laid because some little girl was trying to piss off her daddy. 
 [Chuckles] 
 Hey, J, catch. 
 That's so you can call me next time you decide to sleep somewhere else. 
 [Utensil whisking] 
 Hey. 
 Sorry. 
 Let's go back to bed. 
 Pick up where we left off, no? 
 No. I'm busy. 
 No? 
 Yeah. 
 Really? You're busy? 
 Mm-hmm. 
 [Chuckling] Okay. 
 Mmm. Esta re bueno. 
 Sí? Not too spicy? 
 No. Me Gusta Que pique. 
 Oh, sí, Te Gusta Que pique? 
 [Both laugh] 
 Everything okay with Smurf? 
 Yeah. 
 Yeah, fine. 
 I talked to the doc last night, by the way. 
 Thinks I can take him home today. 
 [Birds chirping] 
 Que bueno. 
 Mm-hmm. 
 Tonz pa Que andas todo preocupado? 
 Mm-hmm. 
 I'm not worried. 
 Baz? 
 Yes? 
 He doesn't blame you. 
 He better not. I didn't shoot him. 
 [Chuckles] 
 What about the guy who did? 
 What about him? 
 Well... 
 What are you gonna do about him? 
 Nothing. 
 And Smurf's okay with that? 
 Someone shot her son, he gets to just walk around? 
 He's not walking around. 
 [Sighs] 
 He died a week ago. 
 Es por eso Que traes la chompa patinando por sabe donde? 
 Yo estoy aqui. 
 Hey. 
 Hola, mi amor. 
 Tienes hambre? 
 Sí. 
 Sí? 
 Baz : Oh, he can eat later. 
 First I got to beat him at Halo. 
 Yo no tengo Halo. 
 What?! 
 "Yo no tengo Halo"? 
 A man's gotta have Halo. 
 Hey. 
 Como Se dice? 
 Gracias. 
 Gracias! 
 Gracias! 
 Smurf? 
 Lena? 
 Baby? 
 Jesus, Smurf! 
 Come on. Okay, splash. 
 Lena, baby! Come here. 
 Oh, calm down, Cat. 
 She's doing great. 
 Are you okay? 
 Oh! 
 She can't swim without floaties. 
 Are you okay? 
 We're gonna have you on a surfboard in no time, my little Lena-roo. 
 Go change. 
 Sweet Lena-roo. 
 Such a good little girl. 
 Janine. 
 I would really appreciate it if you would call me before you do something like that. 
 Like what? She's a California girl. 
 It is ridiculous that she can't swim. 
 We're teaching her. You cannot just throw her in. 
 That's how I learned. I was less than half her age. 
 [Sighs] 
 Are you coming tonight? 
 Baz really missed you, honey. 
 Oh, he didn't tell you? 
 Well, good news, then, huh? 
 I'm making ribs. Bring the baby. 
 I'm working. 
 Well, call in sick. Do you need cash? 
 I can't get my shift covered this late. 
 Quick like a bunny, Lena! 
 W-Why don't you leave her with me today? 
 I know Baz would like it. 
 She's got a doctor's appointment. 
 Maybe next time. 
 [Music blaring, indistinct conversations] 
 Jesus, Nevins. 
 What? I'm... I'm itchy. 
 You need at least a few more hours, maybe another night. 
 Uh, no. Sorry, Doc. Can't do it. 
 We got to go. 
 Where the hell have you been? 
 He needs at least six more hours on the I.V. 
 Well, I don't know what to tell you. 
 We'll take it with us. 
 I talked to Marco. 
 I told him we'd meet him on the beach. 
 No. I'm not doing this with you. 
 Smurf wants us home. We are going home. 
 I almost died. 
 Okay. 
 I gotta seize the day, bro. 
 I'm not letting you have all the fun. 
 Yeah, all the fun. 
 Do you think I like sitting around some bullshit motel waiting for your ass to get better? 
 If I thought that's where you were sleeping, I might feel bad for you. 
 If you over-exert yourself, you're gonna reopen that wound. 
 I'm not saying we're gonna hike a pyramid, but I am gonna drink tequila on the beach or you're going home alone. 
 For Craig's dogs. 
 Mm. Here's your plate, baby. 
 I ate before I went fishing. 
 Just have a little protein, Andrew. 
 Keep up your strength. 
 It's head high. 
 I'm gonna head out before the kooks finish brunch. 
 Stop by Tao's on your way. 
 They're late with the rent. 
 I feel like sh1t. I can't keep anything down. 
 You know, you might feel better if you got a little sleep. 
 We got you a beautiful suite. 
 I can't sleep there. It's noisy. 
 Hey. 
 You know, J hasn't been around as much since Baz went to Mexico, huh? 
 You haven't noticed? 
 I don't care. 
 I'm not sure that's the smartest position to take. 
 You know, you've been gone a long time, baby. 
 Life went on out here. 
 Your brothers did a lot with Baz calling the shots. 
 You're gonna have to work your way back in there. 
 But J... J is new. 
 J is up for grabs. 
 I have to tell you something, but you have to promise you won't get mad, okay? 
 What? 
 Promise. 
 I promise. 
 I lost the watch you gave me. 
 I was wearing it last night, and I thought I put it in my jewelry box, but it wasn't there this morning. 
 I looked everywhere. I don't know what happened. 
 I feel terrible. 
 Nah. 
 Okay. 
 You know I love it. 
 It's the nicest thing anyone's ever given me, and I'm sure it's in my room somewhere. 
 I'm gonna keep looking. I just... 
 No, it's okay. 
 I'll help you find it. 
 Yeah, I'm so, so sorry. 
 [Laughter] 
 Marco : Your brother's a beast. 
 We should put a shot of tequila in that I.V. 
 Only one? 
 Oh, God. 
 Load 'Er up. 
 Yes. 
 Don't encourage him, please. 
 Yo, I got to make up for lost time. 
 Baz left me with Nevins, holding my dick. 
 Did you want me to sit next to your bed, holding your hand? 
 Is that it? 
 And change my bed pan? Yeah. 
 That would've been nice. 
 Hey, Craig, you want to make some money? 
 Old times' sake? 
 No, he doesn't. 
 He doesn't. 
 Marco, leave them alone. 
 What? 
 I want to hear him say it. 
 Marco. 
 No. 
 Craig... you know where Smurf keeps your balls? 
 I know she got Baz's locked up real good. 
 What kind of money you talking? 
 Drink your beer. 
 We don't do that sh1t anymore, okay? 
 Don't tempt him. 
 I forgot. 
 Baz, the white knight, goes around saving everybody. 
 Your brother, my sister. 
 [Laughs] It's cool, bro. 
 "Just say no." I respect that. 
 How about a shot, huh? 
 [Scraping] 
 Yo. 
 What's up, D? 
 Uh, Smurf's looking for the rent. 
 You got to talk to Adrian. He's in the back. 
 All right. 
 [Scraping and brushing] 
 I need the rent. 
 Look, I'm sorry, okay? 
 You didn't have to get the kid in on it. 
 Jesus. 
 Cracked three of my ribs. 
 I had to pay 4 grand for an MRI and make sure my spleen didn't rupture. 
 Yeah, I don't think I'm gonna have the rent for a while. 
 Come on, man, Smurf's gonna lose her sh1t. 
 How about I ask her for the money? 
 I'll tell her you sucked my dick like a champ, then sucker-punched me like a pussy. 
 You owe me 4 grand. 
 Minus the rent, let's make it 2,500. 
 [Gulls crying] 
 Hop in. 
 Sorry, sweetheart. Family stuff. 
 He'll catch up with you later. 
 Uh, okay. 
 Come on. Throw your bike in the back. 
 Let's go. 
 [Grunts] 
 [Tailgate closes] 
 I'm sorry. 
 I'll call you later, yeah? 
 Mm-hmm. 
 Let's go! 
 Sorry. 
 It's okay. 
 [Exhales sharply] 
 [Bag thuds] 
 What's this? 
 Una matraca. 
 Matraca? 
 Uh-huh. 
 When you travel for work, you bring something home for your kid. 
 Okay. 
 Okay? 
 Ya Te extraño. 
 Mm. No tienes Que decir eso. 
 It's true, though. 
 It's true. 
 Bye. 
 Adios. 
 [Engine starts] 
 
 
 
 Wait here. 
 What's he doing here? 
 Leave your car and I'll drop you off after. 
 After what? 
 Hey, I got an English essay to write. 
 I can just take my bike... 
 I got something simple. 
 Smurf cool with it? 
 Smurf doesn't know. 
 Is that gonna be a problem for you? 
 Hell no. 
 Let's go.

 [Indistinct conversation] 
 Krystal : What are we having for dinner? 
 What are we having for dinner? Potato chips? 
 We can't have potato chips for dinner. 
 How much is that? Lena-roo? 
 99.50? How much is that? 
 What are you doing? 
 Hiding. 
 Who are you hiding from? 
 Krystal. 
 How much is that anyway? 
 That's too much! 
 Hey, want to get some ice cream? 
 Come on. 
 Do you have to go to the bathroom? 
 Should we get sprinkles? 
 Yeah. 
 What do you want, rainbow or chocolate? 
 I want rainbow. 
 Lena? Where's Lena? 
 Lena! Lena! 
 Guys, come on, help me find Lena. 
 Put that stuff back. Let's go. 
 You were supposed to help me watch her. 
 Lena! 
 Lena? 
 Plainclothes today. 
 Lieutenant's got us busting tweakers up and down the coast. 
 Well, you look the part. 
 Thank you. [Chuckles] 
 You know, a couple of meth heads knocked over a watch store in Long Beach. 
 You heard about that? 
 No. 
 These guys were so high, they drove the car straight through the window. 
 Must have been living in this car, too, because it smelled like piss and vomit. 
 Those idiots killed a cop. 
 So now they got half of California on this thing. 
 They killed a cop? 
 Off-duty. 
 He was doing security for a merchants' group. 
 Well, I hope you catch them. 
 Oh, we will. Yeah. 
 I just don't see them making it all the way back to the station. 
 So, hey. Is today gonna be the day? 
 [Chuckles] I have a boyfriend. 
 Listen, if I had a girl who looks like you, there's no way I don't stop by at least every now and again. 
 So you're possessive. 
 You say possessive. I say, uh, romantic. 
 [Ringtone plays] 
 Hey, Krystal. 
 W-What's wrong? 
 [Tires screech] 
 You vet this place? 
 It's solid. 
 What are we doing here? 
 Ready to have some fun? 
 [Indistinct conversations] 
 Lucy's looking good. 
 [Chuckles] 
 You have sh1t, like, all over your face. 
 It's up here, it's here, it's there. 
 Come on, man, I'm living vicariously. 
 It's nothing serious. She's got a kid. 
 [Laughs] So do you. 
 [Laughs] 
 What did you do? 
 Don't worry about it. I got it. 
 You got what, Craig? 
 It was a gift. Marco said the sh1t was amazing. 
 Listen to me. When we start moving, you're gonna open your car door slowly and drop it out. 
 I can't. 
 Craig, for sh1t's sake, do it. 
 I can't just toss a quarter key out the window. 
 Cop : You're clear. 
 Where is it? 
 [Dog barks] 
 [Clears throat] 
 It's fine. It's in the burrito. 
 When they get here, you're gonna keep your mouth shut. 
 You're gonna let me do the talking. 
 Stop freaking out. 
 I'm not freaking out. Do you hear me, Craig? 
 Keep your mouth shut. 
 Hey. 
 [Horns honking] 
 See? 
 All good. 
 Go! 
 It's this way. 
 Here. 
 Help. 
 Sledgehammer. 
 Ready? 
 What? Are you afraid of asbestos? 
 [Power tool revs] 
 Hey, don't cut the wire. Could be live. 
 Backpack. Don't forget the backpack. 
 All right, where's the safe? 
 Spread out. 
 Where's the safe, Pope? 
 I don't know. 
 [Chuckling] You don't know where the safe is? 
 Jesus. 
 Right there. 
 Ah! 
 This is it? 
 [Object clangs] 
 This thing is massive. 
 Yeah. Bolted. 
 Backpack. 
 We're good. We're good. 
 Here we go here. I need something to put here. 
 [Air hissing] 
 Yes. 
 Come on. 
 Oh-oh, whoa. Who is that? 
 Who is that?! 
 Come on! 
 Guys! Let's go! 
 Get off. I got it. I got it. 
 Come on! 
 Come on, guys. Come on. 
 Go, go, go, go. 
 Push it through. 
 [Thud] 
 Push it through. 
 Pope, it's not gonna fit. Let's just go. 
 They're coming, man. 
 We're gonna make it bigger. 
 Use the saw, make it bigger. 
 You want me to cut this wire? I'm not gonna cut... 
 I want you to cut the wire. You will cut the wire! 
 Come on, they're coming! 
 They're coming, Pope! 
 Let's go! 
 [Power tool whirring] 
 Okay, now. 
 Jesus. 
 [Groans] 
 That's your brilliant idea?! 
 A goddamn burrito? 
 We got through it, didn't we? 
 That's what you're doing now? 
 You're going behind my back, running sh1t for Marco now? 
 Is that it? 
 It was a gift! 
 Just because you can't see the strings, it doesn't mean there aren't any! 
 Flush it! 
 When's Smurf gonna pay us again? 
 Craig, we... 
 Do you know? 
 We have to be smart right now. Smart! 
 Don't you see that? 
 She destroyed the watches. 
 She's barely giving us enough to live on. 
 Flush it. I'm not driving till you do. 
 Craig, flush it! 
 I can sell it to Renn. 
 We can pocket the cash, and no one has to know. 
 You've got Cath and Lena. 
 Baz. 
 What was she wearing? 
 Um, she had j-jean shorts and a little, like, a pink... a pink hoodie. 
 Do you have a recent photograph? 
 We may need something to circulate. 
 Is this her? 
 Yes. 
 [Tool clangs] 
 What do you think, J? We split this two ways. 
 Deran can keep the p0rn. 
 [Laughs mockingly] 
 Yeah, if you had actually cased the place... 
 The job was solid. We had time. 
 I'm sorry. You're on parole, idiot. 
 You get caught, it's a twenty-year bid. 
 I was looking out for you. 
 J has more balls than you do. 
 Oh, give me a break. 
 He has more balls than you do! 
 What a hero. He cut a wire. 
 Yeah. 
 He's just as stupid as you are, man. 
 What? You really want to go back to prison for... for... for 10 grand? 
 Some of us aren't looking to suck off Mommy's tit for the rest of our lives. 
 You could have fooled me. 
 Go ahead. 
 What? What are you gonna do? 
 Huh? What the hell are you gonna do? 
 Let's just split it three ways. 
 Hmm? 
 Okay, J. 
 If you really want to. 
 Deran, you should thank him. 
 Oh, yeah? You should say, "Thank you, J, for actually having some genuine balls." 
 Go on. It can't be that hard. 
 Say, "Thank you, J, for actually having some balls." 
 I'm not saying sh1t, Pope! 
 Say, "Thank you, J, for actually having some balls. 
 I got scared in there." 
 Say, "Thank you, J, for actually having some balls." 
 Shut up, Pope! 
 Where is she? 
 She's in my room. We're playing dress-up. 
 Are you out of your mind? 
 You kidnapped my child. 
 Your child was wandering around a grocery store all by herself. 
 Krystal was right there. 
 The only thing your friend Krystal is good for is finding drunk assholes to beat the sh1t out of her. 
 Forgive me for trying to protect my family. 
 Not your family. Mine. 
 We don't belong to you. 
 You know, no matter how much you take from us, you never really did want to be a part of this family. 
 Not even when you were a pimply-faced little girl following Pope around like a homeless puppy. 
 I don't want you near Lena. 
 She doesn't need a grandmother who loves her now and turns on her as soon as she grows a pair of tits. 
 Baz may not see it, but I know exactly who you are. 
 You got a nice life, don't you, Catherine? 
 Baz gives you all the things you want. 
 I think it's the life you always dreamed of. 
 Just don't you forget where that life comes from. 
 Lena : Mommy? 
 Janine : Hi, Lena-roo. 
 Time to go. 
 Bye-bye, baby. I love you. 
 Granny loves you. 
 What was that? 
 Some bullshit. 
 [Gulls crying] 
 How'd we do? 
 [Exhales deeply] 
 Prices went up the last couple years. 
 How'd we do? 
 We made 8 grand! 
 Good. Good. 
 Renn is losing her mind. 
 I mean, Marco's sh1t is excelente. 
 You're high right now, aren't you? 
 [Laughs] 
 I had to try it. It's really, really good! 
 [Laughing] Okay. 
 [Engine starts] 
 Whoo! Andale! 
 [Rock music playing, laughter] 
 See? Wasn't that fun? 
 Yeah, you loved it. 
 You did good. 
 I got the watch back from Nicky. 
 What'd you tell her? 
 No, I just took it. She thinks she lost it. 
 Oh, man, she loves that thing. 
 You gotta give it back to her. 
 Smurf said it was a loose end. 
 Tell Nicky not to sell it. 
 Hey. Thanks for today. 
 Hey. 
 What's up? 
 Woman : Hey, gang. 
 Janine : My weary travelers. 
 Welcome home, babies. 
 How do you feel? 
 Eh, all right. 
 Good. 
 Hey, mama. 
 You're alive. 
 Yeah. 
 You smell terrible. 
 [Music continues] 
 Can I speak to you? 
 [Sniffs] 
 Um... 
 I just wanted to say that I didn't see anything the other day. 
 In... In the bathroom at the beach. 
 And either way, I don't care. 
 I don't know what you're talking about. 
 [Sniffs] 
 Dummy. You've only been off the I.V. for like six hours. 
 Switch to beer for a bit, just for fun. 
 See what it feels like. 
 J, try some. 
 Oh, no, thanks. 
 Did you see Lucy while you were there? 
 [Laughs] 
 We got to get you laid, man. 
 You've been out for what, three weeks? 
 That's unacceptable. 
 If I had to go three weeks, my dick would shrivel up and turn to ash. 
 Your dad like a monk or something? 
 No, actually, I saw his dad earlier. 
 Flew by and took a big old sh1t on my car. 
 I thought Pope's dad was a dolphin. 
 Right. One eye and a fin, just flopping around. 
 Smurf felt bad for him and let him knock her up. 
 [Laughs] 
 My dad was a seagull, just squawking and sh1tting everywhere. 
 [Laughs] 
 What was mine again? 
 It was, uh... 
 Killer whale. 
 No way was Deran's dad a killer whale and mine was a goddamn bird. 
 Sorry. 
 Actually, Deran's dad was a selfish prick. 
 And short too. 
 He left Smurf two weeks before you were born. 
 I had to deliver your ugly ass myself in a gas-station bathroom. 
 Slid right out on the floor. 
 Well... 
 I gotta go. 
 I'm not supposed to sleep here, so... 
 [Sets glass on table] 
 [Door opens, closes] 
 [Gasps] 
 Are you okay with what happened with Smurf? 
 [Scoffs] 
 Well, um, I missed two hours of work, and the asshole docked my pay, and my daughter had to sleep in a bar, so... 
 You don't have to tell Baz. 
 You get yourself a decent babysitter. 
 You were my friend first. 
 Patrick : Catherine, you okay? 
 Yeah, I'm okay, Patrick. 
 Don't come here anymore. 
 That's your boyfriend? 
 Uh, his brother. Don't ask. [Chuckles] 
 If that happens again, you can call me. 
 Don't call 911 'cause they ain't gonna do sh1t. 
 Take it. 
 It's really okay. 
 No, take it. 
 Hurricane swell next week, J. 
 Triple overhead, they say. You think you can hang? 
 Yeah, I think so. You do? 
 Oh, he thinks so. Oh, yeah. 
 You gotta be able to hold your breath for a long time. 
 Yeah, I've surfed big waves before. 
 [Sighs] 
 [Slap!] 
 Woman : Jesus, Deran. 
 You've surfed big waves before, huh? 
 Bullshit. 
 You surf, like, 10-footers, 15-footers? 
 Yeah. 
 I'm out of here. 
 I've heard this Laird Hamilton routine already. 
 Mm. 
 Ever get held down by a 20-footer? 
 Huh? 
 Two minutes? Three minutes? 
 Hmm? 
 [Bottle slams] 
 Let's go. Prove it. 
 Let's see it. Prove it, man. 
 Let's go! Let's see what he got! 
 There you go. 
 [Both inhale deeply] 
 [Dramatic music plays] 
 [Coughing] 
 [Panting] 
 Hey. 
 Hey, baby. 
 I don't think the pills are working. 
 At least he's not naked in the backyard howling at the moon. 
 Are you sure he's eating the food? 
 He's eating. 
 'Cause he's complaining about his stomach. 
 I lowered the dose. 
 It takes a few days to kick in. 
 So what happened with Cath? 
 You know how she is. 
 The girl's never been smart enough to see the big picture. 
 I was only trying to make things easier for her, like we always have. 
 This time she seemed... 
 What? 
 Never mind. 
 No. What? She almost seemed what? 
 Ungrateful. 
 Hey, is Nicky here? 
 It's a little late, don't you think? 
 Yeah, I'm sorry. I, um... 
 I just wanted to give her this. 
 She thought she lost it, so... 
 Look, Josh, I don't feel comfortable with you giving Nicky expensive gifts. 
 I mean, I don't know where you got that, and frankly, I don't really want to know. 
 It was just... 
 It was my mom's. 
 It's the only nice thing she really ever had. 
 I'm sorry. I'll go get her. 
 No. It's okay. Um... 
 I got to go, so could you... 
 Just tell her I'll see her around. 
 [Video-game gunfire] 
 Where is he? 
 Who? 
 J. 
 How should I know? 
 Oh, I got the rent from Tao. 
 He said he's sorry it was so late. 
 His backpack is gone! 
 All his clothes are gone! 
 Now, what the hell happened?! 
 I won't ask you again. 
 [Door creaks] 
 [Television chatter] 
 [Television chatter continues] 
 [Sighs] 
 [Breathing deeply] 
 Just do it already. 
 [Breathes deeply] 
 I tracked your phone. I do it with all the boys. 
 I thought it might be better for everybody if I left. 
 Your uncles play rough, baby. They always have. 
 Where are you headed? 
 My mom used to know a guy who lived in Stockton. 
 She talked about him sometimes. 
 You know that my mom was a junkie, too, right? 
 Sometimes she was great. 
 She told me my father was a piece of sea glass. 
 Mine was a tree. 
 So you think this guy in Stockton might be your dad? 
 I don't know. 
 Do you know who my dad is? 
 Your mom always had a lot of guys around, J. 
 I just know she only loved one of them. 
 I tried to make him feel like a part of the family. 
 I could take him in, I could make him my son, but I could not make him her brother. 
 Baz. 
 [Door opens] 
 Man : ...between the crew chief and the driver and, of course, the spotter, especially in a wide-open facility like this one. 
 You talk about how slick it's gonna be. [Television chatter] [Door closes] No more running away, okay? Mom? Hey, it's late. You should sleep. Yeah, I'm really not that tired. Yeah, it's this house. As soon as we moved out, Lena started sleeping through the night. Listen, don't worry about Deran, man. That dude talks big, but that's all it is. It's just talk. All right. I'll see you. Get some sleep. I shot her up the day she died. She couldn't find a vein. That sometimes happened. She asked me to do it, so I did. Right in her foot. Well, it's not your fault, man. Your mom was a wreck. She did that sh1t to all of us. Hey. That's not on you. Sleep. Andrew?
