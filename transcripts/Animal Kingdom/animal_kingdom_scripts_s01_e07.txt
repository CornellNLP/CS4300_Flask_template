 You can't just sneak in like that.

 What about Julia and Baz? Were they close, too? 
 I have an idea for a job.

 I mean, I can't find J anywhere. 
 Pope's been in the yard since 6:00 a.m., punching his stupid bag. 
 [Chuckles] You... you can't get laid here? 
 Did I forget to ask your permission? 
 Hand these out to your brothers. 
 [Scoffs] This is less than the half that we normally get. 
 You're a property manager. That's your paycheck. 
 [Chuckles] Wait. 
 You expect us to live on our actual salaries? 
 You gotta give the boys a little somethin'. 
 You know them. They need sh1t. 
 They're ready to hit a mini-mart. 
 They are or  you,  Baz? 
 [Zipper whirs] 
 We're talking about having another kid. 
 We're gonna need a bigger place. 
 Another kid? 
 What? 
 I'm just wondering if it's the best time for you to knock up Catherine now. 
 Uh... I can handle it. 
 I'm sure you can. 
 It's all there. Just get it done. 
 [Grunting] 
 Deran : What's your problem, Pope? 
 [Continues grunting] 
 You know, Smurf's taking off for the weekend. 
 Toby's taking her to Vegas. Some French circus sh1t. 
 I think Toby's gonna be our new dad. 
 Don't be jealous, baby. It's not a good look. 
 Now the kid from the 7-Eleven is gonna call when they start selling more phone cards. 
 We need to be ready. 
 Why don't we just tell Paul he's in? 
 I mean, we have all this confidential sh1t. 
 What are we waiting for? 
 If you come at him with threats, he's gonna stand up on principle. 
 What are you, a psychologist now? 
 You want someone next to you who doesn't wanna be there? 
 I don't want a guy next to me that I can't trust! 
 [Punching resumes] 
 I'm easing him in. Just give me a few days. 
 Anybody heard from J? 
 Well, somebody better find out what's going on with that kid. 
 When this phone rings, answer it. 
 Here's $1,000. Have fun. See you tomorrow. 
 Deran : Hey, bring a rubber. Toby gets around. 
 [Punching continues]

 Morning. 
 Morning.

 So I'm a pretty terrible cook, but it's food. 
 [Dish clatters, utensil clinks] 
 You know, it's not... typical for teachers to have their students spend the night. 
 [Utensil clinks] 
 I'm sorry. I should get... I should get back. 
 Wait, that's it? 
 You just show up here, all freaked out, don't tell me anything, and now you're leaving? 
 I'm sorry. I don't think so. 
 You're not going anywhere until you talk to me. 
 Come on. You know I can keep a secret. 
 My uncle just got out of prison. 
 Which one? 
 Pope. 
 He, uh... [Clears throat] he robbed a bank. 
 [Inhales deeply] He wasn't alone, but... he was the only one that got caught. 
 Who else was with him? 
 They were all in on it. All of them. 
 My other uncles, my grandmother. 
 You know, she's the one that's kind of in charge, so... 
 In charge? You mean, like... they've done this kind of thing before? 
 And you found out. 
 Is that why you're so scared? 
 Then what is it? 
 They're planning something else. 
 [Panting] 
 You training for something we don't know about? 
 [Continues panting] 
 Pope, if I had known about the pills... 
 You knew! 
 No. I would've told you. 
 There is no way that she drugged me without you signing off on it. 
 You knew. 
 She wants you to find out if I'm still taking 'em? 
 I can't tell which version of me you like better... drugged up or crazy. 
 I kinda think you like me crazy. Less competition.

 You know, maybe we should go back to Belize. 
 You know, surf Long Caye, swim with turtles and sh1t? 
 You know, I was thinking maybe it could just be you and me this time. [Sniffs] 
 [Surf rolling] 
 [Sea birds calling] 
 What's wrong? 
 What? 
 I saw Dave yesterday. 
 He's got some kind of infection in his lungs. 
 He's back in the hospital. 
 You guys still... 
 Nope. [Sighs] 
 Maybe we could go to the D.R.? 
 You know, go in December, surf Encuentro. 
 What's up, Adrian? 
 Hey, Craig. 
 How is it? 
 It's pretty good. It was really fat earlier. Yeah. 
 You been competing? 
 [Liquid sloshes] 
 Uh, here and there. 
 Oh, must be why we haven't seen you. 
 No, I've been around. 
 Ran into Toby in the lot. 
 Guess who doesn't know sh1t about Vegas? 
 Seriously? 
 Hasn't talked to Smurf in a week. 
 She left us a grand. I mean, what are we supposed to do with that except throw a balls-out party? 
 You pencil us in or you got an ESPN interview to do? 
 Yeah, you should come. 
 Guess I'll be there. 
 All right. 
 You did good. 
 See? It's not that hard when you put your mind to it. 
 Good. Well, what? Can you arrest them now? 
 I mean, he implicated the entire family. It's all on the wire. 
 He talked about a 3-year-old crime he wasn't witness to. 
 A few small-time B&Es. 
 It's good. You got him talking. 
 Now we get him talking specifics... the next job, his role in it. 
 His  role? 
 No, I thought you said we had to get him out. 
 If J cooperates, he can plead down. 
 A felony conviction would ruin his life. 
 He's a smart kid. He should be going to college. 
 I mean, Jesus, his mom just died. 
 Plenty of ex-convicts have made something of themselves. 
 No, no, no. You told me that I could help him. 
 I am doing this to protect him. 
 Let me be very clear. 
 You are in this situation because you are weak and selfish. 
 And you're gonna get yourself out of this situation by being weak and selfish. 
 That's who you are. 
 If you wanna tell yourself you care about this kid, be my guest. 
 But you will do whatever you need to do to get him talking because you don't want to go to prison. 
 I owe you big-time. 
 [Chuckles] No, I was happy to do it. 
 No, I do. I do. 
 I just feel bad my guy couldn't get the computers. 
 The asshole already sold 'em. 
 Oh, forget that. Let me take you to dinner. 
 Right? Or... or let me buy you a car. 
 [Laughing] 
 If I could afford one, I-I would buy you a car today. 
 No. Okay. 
 You know what, though? While I have you here... 
 I got a problem with our books. 
 You want me to look at something? 
 No, no, no, just some advice. Um... 
 We made a little more money on our properties than we'd like the federal government to know about. 
 Mm. Little tax evasion, money laundering... 
 [Laughs] No. 
 ...that sort of thing. 
 Is that what we're discussing? 
 No, no, no. Neither. 
 Hypothetically... if someone wanted to move some money and save it for later, how would he do it? 
 Hypothetically? 
 Yeah. 
 [Paul and Baz speaking indistinctly, dog barking] 
 Paul : ...plumbing, electrical business. 
 Something to maintain your building. 
 Baz : Hmm. 
 And then you would pay that vendor for services rendered, only you're the vendor. 
 Well, the problem with that is everybody's done it. 
 The IRS is kind of hip to it, which is what made offshore accounts so appealing back in the day, but now there's a... 
 Actually, I gotta go. 
 My car is in the shop, and I gotta get my kid to baseball practice. 
 Oh. Yeah. Take the Challenger. 
 [Keys jangle] 
 Really? 
 Yeah. 
 I got plenty of cars around here I can use. Take it. 
 Saving my ass again? 
 Yes, I am. 
 Thank you. 
 I'll bring it back, uh, this afternoon. Your place. 
 Yeah. 
 Thanks. 
 How's Nicky? 
 J. 
 You guys are young. I understand that. 
 But you were kinda harsh on her, weren't you? 
 Yeah. I'm sorry, I just... 
 No, it's okay. You know, it's none of my business. 
 I just... [Inhales deeply] 
 [Sighs deeply] 
 Take care of yourself. 
 Hey, look, I'm... I'm sorry about last night. 
 You know, I was walking around the beach all night, thinking about what you said. And... 
 I tried to call Nicky to get her back. 
 You know, I didn't want to come home until I fixed things, but I couldn't. 
 If you care about her, you're gonna stay out of this. 
 You try to warn her, I promise you, she's gonna get hurt. 
 Go get some breakfast. 
 [Bottle scrapes] 
 [Footsteps depart] 
 [Sea birds calling] 
 Thought I'd never hear from you again. 
 Did you get it done? 
 Yeah, I screwed their cameras up pretty good. 
 Won't be able to get a technician in to fix it till Monday. 
 They're flyin' blind all weekend. 
 [Sighs] 
 You stealing cars now? 
 This is business, baby. That's it. 
 Just a guy you call when you need something up north? 
 No. 
 You're an old friend who's doing me a favor... because I paid you. 
 Yeah, all right. 
 How's Craig? 
 Fine. 
 That's all I get? 
 Look, my boys don't know about this, and I don't want 'em to. 
 He still look like me? 
 He never did. 
 [Scoffs] 
 Good seeing you, too, Smurf. 
 Take it easy. [Chuckles] 
 You know, that sh1t's terrible for you. 
 Humans aren't built to digest cheese and sh1t. 
 Lactose. 
 Are you following me? 
 You don't return my calls. 
 Had to track you down. 
 You're staying at a hotel now? 
 Catherine finally realized she could do better? 
 Just a rough patch. 
 Imagine my surprise when I heard someone cut a hole in the wall of a strip mall in San Marcos and jacked a safe from a landscaping business. 
 I got your cut. 
 We were supposed to do that job together. 
 I never agreed to that. 
 I'll find something for us to do together. 
 I just haven't been able to find the right thing. 
 Well, you're in luck 'cause I'm full of ideas. 
 Like what? 
 [Chuckles] 
 Last time I told you about a job, you jacked it. 
 No, this one's solid. I've been casing it all week. 
 You in? Or you need the okay from the family?

 What'd she say? 
 Who? 
 You know who. 
 She doesn't want you to have another baby with me? 
 Two days ago, you were begging me. 
 Smurf didn't say anything. Come on. 
 Vin : I'll take the teller. You take the guard. 
 There's only one. He's about to collect social security. 
 Pope : It's the middle of the day. 
 That's the point. 
 They close down for lunch. 
 We go in as soon as they re-open. It'll just be the two employees. 
 Have you ever hit a bank? 
 You can't just go in with guns. 
 How many cameras? 
 Four. 
 One on the door, one behind the teller, and two in the main room. 
 We're gonna wear ski masks.

 There's one... two right here in the parking lot. 
 First thing the cops will do is pull the tapes. No. 
 I'll find us a job. This isn't it. 
 Yeah? 
 See, it's hard to believe a guy when he's lied about everything else. 
 Catherine's not your wife, for example. 
 You thought I wouldn't find out? 
 Maybe you just thought I'd never get out, so you promised me sh1t you couldn't deliver. 
 What do you think your brother will say about you jacking off to his girl the past three years?

 It that how it worked? 
 Actually, I sort of inherited it. 
 Oh? 
 Yeah, there was a woman. This was her car. 
 Girlfriend? 
 Yeah. Beautiful, wild. 
 She lived in this car for years, with a kid. 
 Your kid? 
 No, just hers. 
 We were doing a lot of coke, weed, following bands around. 
 She got me into some small-time robberies to pay for the drugs. 
 How old was the kid? 
 Must've been... [Sighs] 12, 13 maybe. 
 You know, honestly, Miriam was out of her mind. 
 But the real reason I stayed was for that kid. 
 She was funny and smart and sweet. 
 Sort of took care of us both. 
 She loved to swim. 
 [Chuckles] She'd stay in the water till she turned blue. 
 I called her "Smurf." 
 I loved that kid.

 Hey, I got a bottle of champagne in my office. 
 Let me grab it, and we can toast to your new car.

 [Car door creaks, closes] 
 [Dog barking in distance] 
 Hey. 
 Hey. 
 Making a smoothie. Do you want one? 
 Sure. 
 [Whirring loudly] 
 What's this? 
 [Whirring stops] 
 So you said they're planning something else. 
 Think they'll ask you to be a part of it? 
 [Mouths words] 
 [Crickets chirping] 
 [Cellphone ringing and vibrating] 
 Woman : Wait, whose phone is that? 
 [Grunting] Huh? 
 Whose phone is that? [Moaning]

 Oh, sh1t! sh1t! 
 What? 
 Where is it? 
 [Ringing and vibrating continues] 
 Aah! Goddamn it! [Sighs] 
 [Ringing and vibrating continues] 
 [Cellphone beeps] 
 [Panting] Hello? 
 [Continues panting] When? 
 Okay, thanks. 
 [Cellphone beeps] 
 I gotta go. 
 Are you serious? 
 [Belt buckle clinking] 
 [Grunts] 
 Hey. 
 [Kisses] 
 Sorry I missed you at Smurf's. 
 [Bottles clink] 
 You still mad at me? 
 No. 
 [Cap fizzes] 
 No? 
 What? What is it? 
 It's Pope. 
 He keeps coming around. 
 He loves you. 
 He always has. 
 You can't blame him. Pope's Pope. 
 Cath, everything's fine. It's better than fine. 
 We're about to pull a good job here, life-changing money. 
 But I... 
 [Whispers] Cath, everything's good. 
 [Knock on glass, door slides open] 
 What is it? 
 The guy called. I didn't wanna call your cell. 
 [Footsteps depart] 
 What'd he say? 
 The 7-Eleven on the base sold three times the number of phone cards in the last two days. 
 That only happens before they deploy. 
 It's gonna happen this week. 
 [Keys jangle] 
 [Both breathing heavily] 
 What? What? 
 [Grunts] 
 [Whispering] I just wanna be okay. 
 I just want us to be okay. 
 I just want it to be okay, please. 
 Please? 
 You wanna come inside? 
 Come on in. 
 You want me to come to a party? 
 I'll be there. 
 Or we can go surfing... 
 [Sniffs] 
 Go to Belize. 
 Whatever you want, man. You're in charge. You made that clear. 
 [Dog barking in distance] 
 But sorry, you can't make me feel something I don't.

 Hey. 
 Can you be my friend right now and not a cop? 
 [Sighs deeply] 
 Hey. 
 Help me, would you? 
 I'm sorry about the whole Nicky thing. 
 I hope you didn't take it personally. 
 Baz says we need Paul, so... 
 I guess we need Paul. 
 [Clatter, bags rustling] 
 He's mad you broke up with her. 
 Says we can't trust you. 
 I tried to tell him, love makes you do sh1t.

 Goddamn animals. 
 [Men shouting indistinctly, ball bouncing] 
 Man : I got it, I got it! 
 [Indistinct shouting continues] 
 Paul : One sec, man. One sec. 
 Man : Come on, bro! You gotta stay on it. 
 Hey. 
 Your wife told me where you were. 
 Everything's cool, right? The car's cool? 
 Car is fine. 
 All right. 
 I thought I was gonna have a little more time with this. 
 With what? 
 [Sighs deeply] I'm just gonna take a gamble, and I'm gonna tell you the truth, okay? 
 Should I sit down for this? [Laughs] 
 How do you think I got your briefcase back? 
 Oh, Baz, I don't know, man. I don't... 
 I know you don't wanna know. Thing is, it was easy... 'cause my brothers robbed your place. 
 Awesome. Maybe you can get my TV back. [Laughs] 
 Doesn't that make the most sense? 
 I mean, it makes a lot more sense than I know a guy who knows the ins and outs of the criminal underworld. 
 [Siren wailing in distance, ball continues bouncing] 
 Why would you do that? 
 'Cause you weren't ready and you needed a push. 
 Paul, you're a smart guy. 
 You can spot an opportunity when it presents itself. 
 I'm about to present you with an opportunity. 
 ♪♪ 
 You're blackmailing me? 
 No. I know you'd stand up to that sort of thing. 
 You should get out of here. 
 No, no, no, don't do that. Don't get angry. 
 I'm talking about a partnership. 
 No. 
 No, I'm not doing anything illegal. 
 Well, you took my 5 grand, you gave me those great tips... 
 If you're gonna cross a line, you make sure it's a line worth crossing. 
 Now you made 5 grand today. 
 How'd you like to make some real money? 
 [Birds chirping] 
 How was Vegas? 
 Craig ran into Toby. 
 Where'd you really go? 
 I'm tired, Baz. 
 I talked to Paul. We're good. 
 Good. 
 You okay? 
 Hey. 
 Smurf... 
 What happened?
