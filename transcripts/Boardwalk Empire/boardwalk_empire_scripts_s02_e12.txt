 And with the arsenic being  introduced slowly,  the victim is often unaware of being poisoned at all. 
 Halloran : How do you explain this, Mrs. Pratt? 
 Take this and go far away. 
 Jimmy :  This strike needs to end. 
 I plan to make your murder charge go away. 
 Chalky :  The families of my men that got killed-- 
 $3,000 apiece. 
 And them three hooded crackers did the shootin'? 
 I want them delivered to me personally. 
 Nucky :  There's roughly 160,000 acres. 
 I've instructed Bill Fallon to draw up papers transferring it all to your name exclusively. 
 If you're willing to testify that you committed the murder at Nucky's behest, Randolph won't argue for the electric chair. 
 Fallon :  Randolph wants you in the noose for Hans Schroeder. 
 They're putting the prohi on the stand. 
 Nucky :  Van Alden? 
 About a year ago the Deacon held our annual week of miracles. 
 Your agent Van Alden show up one afternoon-- he drowned that fella in front of us all. 
 Randolph : Agent Van Alden. 
 Hands straight in front of you and take a-- 
 (Shouts) 
 I've been subpoenaed. 
 Are you actually talking about testifying? 
 If you want to punish yourself because your daughter got sick, that's your business, but I will not permit you to sacrifice me. 
 Mickey : Jimmy's coming back. 
 Seems unlikely. 
 Mickey :  He didn't ice her. 
 Capone :  Then who did? 
 Mickey :  Manny Horvitz. 
 Gillian :  Poor girl. 
 We'll need to consider Tommy. 
 A month from now he won't even remember who she-- 
 (choking) - I'll remember! I'll remember! 
 Ha! 
 Ah! 
 (Wheezes) 
 (Grunts) 
 Finish it. 
 (Yells) 
 (Theme music playing) 
 Who the hell are you two jokers?! 
 Man :  What do you want? 
 Good, we have your attention. 
 Jesus! 
 What the hell's going on? 
 Richard : Five seconds, gentlemen. 
 It was Herb Crocker. He was one. 
 And, uh... 
 Let's get out of here! 
 Come on. 
 ...Dick Heatherton. 
 Who else? 
 (Grunts) 
 Odessa, now there's a city for you. 
 (Distant cantor singing) 
 Everyone's a crook. 
 Little crooks take from who they can. 
 Nobodies stealing from nobodies. 
 Then the middleman. Hmm. 
 How many nobodies does it take to feed him? 
 Seven? 
 10? 
 The middleman is always hungry, always worried. 
 Because from the middle, it's easier to fall down than to climb up. 
 But the big crooks-- the  machers  in Odessa-- the big crook does nothing. 
 Drink kvass, eat roast chicken and fish soup, stroll with some cute little  tsatske  along Deribasovskaya street, everybody tips their hat. 
 The big crook in Odessa, he's somebody. 
 I wake up sometimes and I think I'm still there-- 
 12 years old, my whole life ahead of me. 
 But then I realize I'm in America,  that world is gone and you have to make the best of it. 
 I understand we've both had a rough time of it recently. 
 I sketched it out for him. 
 I must stay away from home-- for the safety of my family. 
 Close my shop. 
 I'm living like a beggar. 
 Bit of bad luck. Happen to anyone. 
 But my bad luck has a name-- 
 Waxey Gordon. 
 Let me stop you right there. 
 Whatever your problems, Waxey Gordon is a business partner of mine. 
 Are you sure about this, Mr. Thompson? 
 Do you know something I don't? 
 The question answers itself. 
 Nucky's a busy fella, Manny. 
 And I have nothing better to do? 
 You're hiding in the basement of a synagogue. 
 Don't waste his time. 
 Your partner Waxey Gordon is in business with James Darmody. 
 Would you say we have something in common? 
 We might. 
 Then let us help each other. 
 You give me Waxey, I give you Darmody and we make business together. 
 You'll "give him" to me? 
 In all honesty, you don't look to be in a condition to do anything. 
 Well, if the Boychik's wife could still talk, she'd tell you otherwise. 
 Maybe we have less in common than you think, Mr. Horvitz. 
 You said he was open to discussion. 
 I said I'd broker the meet. 
 So you're too big a crook to be seen with the likes of me? 
 According to the federal prosecutor, yes. 
 But I will consider your proposition. 
 Make sure Mickey knows how to get in touch. 
 He's heading to jail and this is the look he gives me? 
 (Doors close) 
 He ain't in jail yet. 
 He would be nothing in Odessa. 
 (Distant singing continues) 
 (Cars approaching) They're here. Open it on up. There's 20,000 cash, 5,000 apiece for the families of each victim. I only asked for three. I know you did. (Whimpering) The three pieces of sh1t that shot this place up. You sure about that? Ask them yourself. That gonna be  my  pleasure. (Loud whimpers) - Governor office dropped my case. You can tell your daddy I'll call off the strike. I will. And you can do something for me. Tell Nucky I want to talk. Welcome back, fellas! No! Come on, take him, boys. Come on. No no! How that feel? You like that? Man :  That's right, you pull 'em! Whatever you do to try to change things... (Klansmen screaming) You know he'll never forgive you. Man :  Got a lot more for you. (Grunting, thudding) Let's go to Childs. I feel like a steak. (Screaming continues) Come, dear. Come-- come get Beatrice. Lilian :  Go ahead, Emily. Good girl! That's it. I'm going to fall. You've got to at least try. Come on. Go on now, show us what a big girl you are. Daddy! Hi sweetie. Mr. Thompson. How was Philadelphia? Where is Mrs. Schroeder? She left, sir, 20 minutes ago. She didn't say where she was going. Lilian. Emily. Katy. (Bell rings) She brings a priest? I'm surprised she doesn't have an infant suckling at her breast. Bring me back a shaved cherry ice. I'm boiling. Mrs. Schroeder? How do you do? I'm Esther Randolph. This is father Brennan. He's here-- I'm here for moral support. I don't think I'll need it. I meant for Mrs. Schroeder. She understood that, father. Mrs. Schroeder has left her children--  including her sickly daughter-- to be here today. What's wrong with her? Polio. I'm terribly sorry. Mrs. Schroeder is a widow and devoted mother. She is active in the church and ignorant of any of the charges in this case. I didn't realize they taught law at the seminary. Perhaps we can let Mrs. Schroeder speak for herself. There's nothing she-- I'd like to speak with miss Randolph alone. I'm not sure that-- Thank you, father. Well, I suppose I'll buy some stamps. Is it difficult to become a lawyer? Not if you set your mind to it and don't take no for an answer. I doubt it was that simple. You're right. I started as a public defender. As you might imagine, my only clients were women. What kind of women? The kind who don't have any other choice. Are you saying I did? Why don't you tell me? You cleared the room. My husband beat me. He beat our children. He was a drunkard and a philanderer. And now you've moved up in the world. Do you hate Mr. Thompson? No, I rather like him. Not that it matters. Do you hate him? Your feelings are complicated. The truth is complicated as well. Then I'd be very interested in hearing what you have to say. Would I have to appear in court? I'll compel you to testify, whether you cooperate with me or not. I can paint you either way on that witness stand, it's really up to you: The helpless widow unwittingly drawn in by her husband's killer,  or the shameless gold-digger seduced by money. Does it matter to you that neither of those are true? (Sternly) It matters that Enoch Thompson goes to jail. What has he given you besides money? He's never been cruel to me. He's been plenty cruel to others. I've never seen it. But you know it anyway. I have children. And does their well-being trump everyone else's? The victims as well as the criminals? If you had your own, you'd never ask. If I had my own,  I couldn't bear knowing that their comfort was bought with the blood of others. Because sooner or later they'll find out themselves and that won't be a happy day. If I did what you ask, what becomes of me? You'll never have to see him again. Set yourself free, Mrs. Schroeder. You'd be amazed at how much better you'll feel. How do you "order" someone to commit murder? It's f*cking ludicrous. That's my position. If I ordered them to step in front of a train, would they do that too? If they would, your troubles are over. God damn it. Eddie! Ja? Why is this bourbon empty? Someone drank it. You're cracking wise now? I will refill it immediately. Bring some ice, for God's sake. It's f*cking sweltering. We should discuss your brother. If you could talk to him-- in protective custody? Get word through his lawyer. Make him an offer of some kind. Which is swell, except we both know he's not the real problem. (Eddie hacking at ice) I suppose there is an elephant in the room. If you're referring to  the woman who sleeps in the bed in which I am no longer welcome, then yes, there certainly is. Her testimony's what'll sink you. She doesn't know anything. But even if the jury thinks she does, that's enough to corroborate Eli and Halloran. They're accomplices. They'll say anything to get off. (Phone ringing) And juries know that. But if there's an independent corroboration of what those accomplices allege, even by inference-- it could be enough to convict you. (Phone rings) The bottom line's that if your lady-friend testifies... Ahem. Chalky White is on the line. (Waves breaking, wind chimes ringing) (Birds chirping) (Car approaching) Hello? Nucky. Your door was open. This is Owen Sleater. You could wait outside. It's okay. I used to do your job. You're the reason I'm doing it now. I'm sorry about Angela. Manny Horvitz. Philadelphia. Never heard of him. He used to work for Waxey Gordon. He came for me, found her instead. If I hear anything, I'll let you know. No thank you. To the lost. My father's dead. I should have killed him... The moment he suggested betraying you. I thought about it since I was a kid-- killing him. I don't know what stopped me. He was your father, James. Nothing looms larger. Last year when he was sick, i went to see him. He looked... pathetic. He was scared and he was trembling. I put my hand on his chest. I looked into his eyes. And he said, "you're a good son." Knocked the wind out of me. I know there's nothing I can say, Nuck. Maybe there's something I can do. For me? How about telling the truth? I was angry. About what? Who I was. Who you are. What I'd been through-- over there. The shooting... I never meant for that to happen. Then why did it? You said you wanted to talk, James. And suddenly you're very quiet. It was Eli. And you had nothing to do with it? Let me make things right. Or as right as they can be. Just tell me how to help you. (Rustles) A scarf? In this weather? It'll be winter soon enough. I need to speak with you. We were both raised catholic, but I suppose it's fair to say that we have fundamental differences in our approach to religion. You lost your faith. If there really is a God, would he have given me this mug? Look, maybe there is some being in the sky who sits in judgment. We'll all find out soon enough. But my relationship to whatever that is, it doesn't need rules. So your version of God asks nothing? It asks that I love my family, that I care for them and protect them. There is more God in the love I feel for you and those children than in all the churches in Rome. I know you're in pain. And I know how hard it's been. But it will get better, you'll see. We just need to stick together. I adore you, Margaret. I adore our family. My entire universe-- it's within these walls. The rest can disappear. And if I were to believe all that? I need you to marry me. Need? So you won't have to testify. I  want  you to marry me. Why did you not say that? Because I didn't want to insult you by pretending that you wouldn't be saving my life. I've done bad things--  horrible things that I convinced myself were justified. I can see how wrong that was  and God or no God, no one is sorrier than I am. (Kettle whistling) I'm afraid, Margaret. I don't want to die or spend the rest of my life in jail. I'd never admit that to anyone but you. You are always surprising. I will grant you that. (Whistling stops) (Music playing) The death certificate's been approved. You should keep a copy for your files. "Cause of death: Accident." That cost a pretty penny. There's also the question of his will. I didn't realize he had one. From 1914. He never revised it. And? He left the bulk of his estate to a Louanne Pratt. His servant... Who tried to poison him. What if he had no will? His estate goes to you, as next of kin. And from me to my son-- when I die. Heaven forbid. Sir? Your guests have arrived. Be firm in what you want. You need to make sure that they-- Ma. No more advice. I've only tried to help you. I never meant for any-- I know you did. You're the man of the house. All : Ma'am. Gentlemen. Jimmy. (Groans) Obviously, with my father's passing, things have changed quite a bit. I'm talking to the mayor about naming a street for him. My condolences. On your wife as well, Jim. Thank you. I've rethought our position regarding Nucky. His ass in a sling seems like the right position to me. (Chuckles) We're going after Eli. You'll recant your testimony, all of you, blame everything on him. What? After all this?! My reputation's on the line. And if Nucky beats the charges, where's your reputation then? He's on the ropes, kid, on the run. This is no time to lose confidence. What do you think, leander? My advice is to stay the course. You been through the wringer, kid. Your wife, now your pop-- that's a burden for any man. Boyd :  Take a trip, clear your mind. A week from now, this will all be over. Ryan :  We've come this far, why turn back? Neary :  Besides, I like being the treasurer. (Laughter) 
 
 Nucky :  Is your name Emily Schroeder? Emily :  Yes. Are you the strongest little girl in the world? Yes. Are you the strongest mightiest-- Yes. Yes. --Strongest girl in the world? Yes. Can you walk to daddy? Teddy :  You can do it. Nucky :  Keep your legs still. Now put your crutch out. Teddy :  Start with your right foot. Nucky :  Just your-- now take a step. Now do the other crutch. Now take a step. Teddy :  That's great! There you go. Just like that, see? Come on, sweetie, you can do it. You can do it! Good. Just like that. Crutch... That's it. Walk to daddy! ...Then step. Crutch... Teddy :  Come on! ...Step. You're doing it! Emily, you can do it! Nucky :  Are you as strong as your big brother? Come on. Come on, Emily. You can do it. Come on, Emily, you can do it. Oh, there you go, come on. Come on. (Silverware clanks) Thank you. I would like you to come with me, please. Where? Mr. Sleater will drive us to the church, where I intend to make a full and complete confession. Then after I've made my peace with God, father Brennan will marry us. Thank you. I don't know what's-- Children? We'll be back later. Say goodbye to your father. Bye. Bye, daddy. Emily :  Would you like some more? Katy, I need you to come with us, please. (Piano playing) May it please the court, gentlemen of the jury, my name is Esther Randolph, assistant United States attorney. Bless me, father, for I have sinned. During the course of this trial, you'll hear a great many charges brought against Enoch Thompson. First and foremost,  that he ordered the murder of a Mr. Hans Schroeder, a romantic rival. Using his influence as treasurer of Atlantic county, Mr. Thompson also engaged in other violations of the law,  enlisting his underlings in graft, violations of the Volstead Act and extortion of local businesses. Enoch Thompson is a man who will stop at nothing to achieve his ends, a man whose greed knows no boundaries. Brennan :  Let women be subject to their husbands as to the lord, for the husband is the hand... Randolph :  You'll hear how rather than minding the city's coffers,  he was instead lining his own pockets. Brennan :  Therefore, as the church is subject to Christ, so also let the wives be to their husbands in all things. (Moaning) (Phone ringing) Randolph :  Along with his various aldermen, he has plundered the citizens of Atlantic county, using the spoils to ensure his position by rigging last year's election. You'll hear directly from some of these aldermen, including James Neary, now the interim treasurer. (Moaning) (Phone ringing) Oh God. What the f*ck? (Door slams) Look at me. Take a coffee break, don't come back. Marriage is an institution not to be taken lightly... Enoch Thompson is a man loyal only to himself. Brennan :  ...A sacred covenant before God. A man who orders up murder like you and I order coffee. Knowing this, I ask you, do you, Margaret, choose to marry Enoch, to join with him as your husband,  for all the days of your life? I do. Jimmy :  "...At which point  sheriff Elias Thompson ordered me to falsify  voting records..." I, Enoch, take you, Margaret, for my lawful wife. Sign it. Nice, fellas. A f*cking confession signed at gunpoint. It's not just a confession. (Gags) - Richard: It was a suicide note. You may kiss the bride. Accordingly, there can be only one just verdict-- guilty. (Woman shrieking) (Gavel pounds) Order! Order! (Murmuring) A last-minute marriage, an alleged suicide, sudden recantations of sworn testimony. In my eight years as a prosecutor, I have never seen a more blatant example of witness tampering. Objection! I resent these insinuations, your honor. Insinuations? They're flat-out accusations! Simply because miss Randolph's case is unraveling  like a ball of yarn, I don't-- Spare me, Mr. Fallon. We all know what's going on here. Until you can prove it, I suggest-- (gavel bangs) Order! Counsel, approach bench. You have no chance at a murder conviction and you've lost your main witness on the other charges. Do you really want to proceed with this fiasco  until jeopardy attaches? Or would you rather go get your ducks in a row? She who fights and runs away... I'll take the ducks, your honor. The defense motion for a mistrial is granted. This case is dismissed without prejudice. (Clamoring) Your honor, I move that my client sheriff Elias Thompson be released on his own recognizance. Granted. I make the same motion for my client deputy Raymond Halloran. Your client confessed to murdering Hans Schroeder. We had a plea deal, your honor. Then I suggest you read it. It was conditioned on the fact that Mr. Thompson's murder charge goes to the jury. Mr. Halloran, you are hereby remanded  to the federal penitentiary at Leavenworth, Kansas. What? Wait a minute! I don't understand! No! No! Reporters : Nucky, Nucky! Mr. Thompson! A few words, Mr. Thompson? How do you feel right now? (All shouting) (Fiddle playing) (Kids laughing) Boy : Mommy, look! Jimmy : What about this pony? He's looking to make friends. Tsk tsk tsk. Here you go. What do you say? Thank you. All right, hold it flat out in your palm, just like that. Just like that. Pretty wet, huh? He wants you to pet him. He likes that. He's a gentle little one. You know, when I was your age, a little bit older, and it was hot like this, I'd head out here. The boardwalk didn't come out this far then. I'd build a lean-to out of driftwood. A pocketful of peanuts and pretend I was Robinson crusoe. With mima? No, mima didn't know where I was. Nobody did. It was just me, myself and I. Can I do that? Sure. All right, here we go. Whoa! (Grunts) Hands here, hold on with your legs. Tighter. It won't bother him. Cowboy or soldier? Soldier. You pay me after. Jimmy : Hold on, buddy. (Music continues) You're awake. And I'm drunk. Not the most romantic greeting, was it? Honesty has its virtues. I was out celebrating with Fallon. Yes, congratulations. A stroke of luck. I know what you're thinking. Really? What's that? The mistrial, I had nothing to do with Neary's suicide, Margaret. I believe you. Look, I'd be lying if I said it didn't benefit me. Obviously it did. But he was a very troubled man,  involved in something he knew was wrong. I can't be responsible for all the misfortune in the world, can I? I said I believe you. Have you seen the evening paper? Congress is set to approve the road appropriations. 10 million for New Jersey. A good day for the state. A good day for us. That land will be worth a fortune, Mrs. Thompson. So you've said. I'll need you to sign the deed back over soon as you get a chance. Of course. It was only for safekeeping. Am I sleeping in here? We  are  married. Who knows? Maybe you're right. Maybe God  is  giving me another chance. (Laughing) (Car approaching) Hey, Uncle Nucky! Brian. Getting big. Dermott. Help yourself. A little early, isn't it? My own recognizance. It means I make the rules. (Exhales) Hot enough for you? Yes. And how about those Phillies? And my brother tried to have me killed. Et tu,  Eli? What? Shakespeare. "Julius Caesar." There's a character named Eli? I told you I had nothing to do with that. The shooting. That's not what your partner said. My partner? Jimmy. What do you expect, Nucky? That f*cking kid'll lie about anything. After all this, will you at least do me the courtesy of being honest? I am being honest. I tried to stop them. They threatened me-- my life, my livelihood. No-- I came to you, Nucky. You forget? Hat in hand? And you pissed on me. (Kids yelling) Hey! You rip those pants, you'll be sorry! What? You'll plead guilty. Woman : Dexter! What? To everything-- all of it, before they bring new charges. Nucky, that's-- I spoke to the Attorney General. You'll do two years at the most, be out in half that time. June, the kids... (Sighs) ...They'll be well looked after. It's the best you're going to do, Eli. God knows it could be a lot worse. (Sighs) I'd understood it was brown. Some is. There's all different types. It should be gold, you ask me. They try it once, you've got a customer for life. And your supplier? Some chink downtown. Ship it in from the orient. We could start an import operation-- (phone rings) Chinese lanterns, things of that nature. Cut out the middleman. Just so you know, we come to you with this first. Out of respect. (Door opens) Sir? Nucky Thompson calling. Mr. Thompson, congratulations. I hear Mr. Fallon earned his fee. Well, I'm sure he thinks he did. (Rothstein chuckles) What can I do for you? Manny Horvitz. Mm-hmm. I've heard the name. And if he were suddenly to be among the departed? Why do you ask? As a courtesy. He has a connection to Waxey Gordon, who I know has a connection to you. If Mr. Horvitz were to go? (Softly) Who gives a sh1t? I would have no opinion one way or the other. Well then, it appears  I  have a decision to make. Flip a coin. When it's in the air, you'll know which side you're hoping for. (Exhales) With the greengrocer right up the street. And, uh, if you're churchgoing people--? Van Alden : We are. St. Mary of Czestochowa is nearby. Very nice. It's a quiet town for quiet people, like most of the midwest. I'm sure we'll be quite happy here. As am I. That's the first two months in advance. Mr. and Mrs. Mueller, welcome to Cicero. (Music playing) Jimmy : So the whole company... Gillian : Ow! Is supposed to be singing. And this fella Radcliff, (laughing) He starts changing the words. ♪ Over there ♪

And I'd feel... This is where I'm meant to be. (Snorts) - Nobody was meant to be there. But that's where we were. And we're still there, aren't we? Tommy :  One, two, three, go! Time to come home, Richard. How? I don't know. But promise me you're gonna try. Tommy :  Okay, go go go! (Phone ringing) (Humming) Hello. Nucky :  It's me. I've located your friend Mr. Horvitz. How? Mickey Doyle. Horvitz is meeting me in one hour. The war memorial. (Tommy chattering) I'll be there. Who was that? Nucky. He found Manny Horvitz. I'll come with you. It's okay. Tommy :  Okay, I'm gonna have all the horses now. I could take care of this for you. This is something I gotta do myself. (Toy clatters) How about putting this guy in the car? Tommy :  We're gonna have a fight with the cowboys in the car. Gillian :  Oh. You can do whatever  you want.  (Door closes) (Thunder rumbles) Yeah! Did Jimmy go out? Yes. Something he has to do. Come on, you. Upstairs. What are you wearing under there? So they can always tell who you are. Did daddy give you those? (Thunder rumbles) You know what? What? You're going to be a big man in this city one day. Just like your father. (Thunder crashes) James. So now you will have your revenge, Boychik. Is that what this is? (Shotgun cocks) His boot. I'm not armed. He isn't. This is the only way we could have ended, isn't it? This is your choice, James. I died in the trench, years back. I thought you knew that. So who's going to do it? Manny? You? Eli? I am. My first time I vomited after... Two days straight. Second time I didn't even think about it. So f*cking stupid. Just try to make yourself calm. You had everything going... Breathe, Nuck. Your whole life. You'll get through it. All you got to worry about is when you run out of booze and you run out of company and the only person left to judge you is your-- (Jimmy coughing, gagging) You don't know me, James. You never did. I... am not seeking forgiveness. (Choir vocalizing) (Mortar whistling) (Explosions, gunfire) (Muffled shouting) (Whistle tooting) Man :  Advance! It was only the angels bowling up in heaven, dear. Nothing at all to be afraid of. Good morning. Good morning. Are you not having breakfast? Early meeting. You were late last night. I was beginning to get worried. No need. Where were you? Just out. In the rain? I ran into James Darmody. Really? And how was that? It was fine. We cleared the air. I'm surprised. My new leaf. It turns out he's reenlisting. Already left, actually. Well, the rain broke the heat at least. Yes. It did. I'll be home for dinner. (Music playing) (Music continues) Bader : What are you doing? (Horn blares) You're in the middle of the highway! Congratulations, Nucky. Gentlemen. (Horn blares) Bader :  Not a minute too soon. We're almost out. So this is it, eh? The road to riches. I was thinking the Harding highway. It never hurts to remember your friends, huh? Katy? I need you to drop this with father Brennan. (Cheers) To the future, gentlemen! Hear hear! (Laughs) There you are. Mayor? Oh, thank you.
