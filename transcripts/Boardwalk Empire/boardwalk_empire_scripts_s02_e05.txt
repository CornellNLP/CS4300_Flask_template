 Eli :  All alone, big brother? 
 Eli, right now you tell me you want to get out of this, I will help you. 
 Because in a minute it's going to be too late. 
 I have a sister. Her name is Emma. 
 When I came back from the war  she nursed me, but I felt nothing. 
 Louis? Louis? 
 It's apoplexy. A stroke. 
 He can't even talk. We're in for 70 grand to his cronies. 
 They'll get paid back when we unload the booze. 
 Mr. Sleater will be driving me now. 
 Katy. 
 A bit cheeky, isn't he? 
 He's serving a purpose. 
 We hear you're flush with hooch. 
 You heard right. I need cash upfront. 
 Five grand and we can make delivery tomorrow night. 
 We've got a deal. 
 I just figured a way to get your case dismissed. 
 Nucky :  I violated the Mann act. 
 Which means the entire election case So the Attorney General can help? Exactly. This is what you used for the cause? It was our mission to execute a bombing a week. Someone's going out of business. Mickey Doyle. Do you remember when we met? That first night? I opened my eyes to find you atop me. Do you remember that night? I asked you a question. (Grunting) (Theme music playing) (music playing) Nucky over P.A. :  Atlantic City was built for good times, so that folks could leave their cares behind-- see a show, dance on the pier... Would you like a flower? ...Build a castle in the sand. You can take two. Atlantic City was built to help people forget. But this day-- Memorial Day-- is for remembering. Today,  we are proud simply to be Americans. I'd like to thank the members of our memorial committee here with us today,  who worked tirelessly to make this monument  possible. I'm sure they will convey our gratitude as well to Louis Kaestner, our own beloved commodore. I know he would not miss this occasion He truly is this city's doting father. Thanks as well to the Attorney General of these United States, the distinguished Harry M. Daugherty, who joins us bearing the express good wishes of president Harding, himself attending the solemn observances this day at Arlington national cemetery. Nucky :  And now, in reading the names of our city's fallen heroes, I feel it fitting to bestow that honor on a young man who can speak more directly to the ideals of sacrifice, service and loyalty, more than I ever could. James Darmody, step up here. You didn't tell me you were going to speak. I wasn't. James Edison Darmody, ladies and gentlemen. You think I can't play this game? I don't think you even know the rules. Mr. Thompson just said some impressive things about me. But they're not true. I'm no one's idea of a hero,  least of all mine. And when people ask me what I did over there,  what I tell them is: I made it back. We fought for the idea that democracy was worth saving. We fought for our mothers. For our sons. For our wives. We fought for America. I believe it was worth it. Man :  Well said. Woman :  Hear hear. These are the names of brave men. "John Archer Alberts... Frank Berry... John Collins... Lester Dayton..." I knew Les. "Andrew Furey... Joseph Grant... Robert Garner..." (Music playing) ♪ There's a rose that grows ♪ 
♪ in no man's land ♪ 
♪ and it's wonderful ♪

♪ though it's sprayed with tears ♪ 
♪ it will live for years ♪ 
♪ in my garden of memory ♪ 
♪ it's the one red rose ♪

♪ of no man's land. ♪ Did you hear him up there? "Fought for democracy"? What a load of bull. Who's this? The young vet at the ceremony this morning, Harry. You know why he enlisted? These are getting tight. They look fine.  - Because he couldn't hack it at Princeton. Talk about the "waist" in Washington, huh? Ho ho. I jumped through hoops to get him in there and he runs away? Joins the army? He's a patsy. Uh-huh. The world doesn't owe you anything. I don't care who you are. Nucky, Jess and I are only here for the day. We're addressing your legal problems tonight. And? It's a holiday. How about we just play some golf? Am I boring you, Harry? I think it's fair to say that I've gone out of my way on this, don't you? It's not the easiest deal to finesse. I've gone down the list of prosecutors, and this fella-- Charles Kennan Thorogood. He's someone you can work with. You actually enjoy golfing? I'd enjoy being a man with the time to play it. See you on the green. I hear you're acquainted with a Mr. George Remus. I'm acquainted with a lot of people. I completely understand. It's just I'm meeting him in Cincinnati on Wednesday. Would you consider him reliable in a business setting? I'd consider him a major bootlegger. That would be the business I'm talking about. Perhaps you could put in a word. Let him know I don't bite. (Wheezing laughter) You made a fine speech this morning. Quite moving. Very patriotic. We want people to know how proud this city is of the boys who went over there. Hear hear. Man :  Nothing's cheaper than sentiment. I'm the only one in this room ever wore the blue. When was that, Mr. Parkhurst? Fort Kearny, Wyoming territory. He blew the trumpet for the ninth. 32 white men against 2,000 sioux. We had the latest springfields and God damn me to hell if we didn't cut those painted bucks to red ribbons. A slaughter. That's all it ever is, boy. You came out of the last one rather well though, didn't you, Jackson? I cleared a cool million selling chipped beef to the army and I don't care who knows it. Smart bet there, sir. Seize an opportunity. Chipped beef. I had it every day for five months. I'd rather eat dog turds. (Laughter) Well, they paid me anyway. As you can see. Then you're a great man. What's all this horseshit anyway? We're here to discuss money. There's concern about the recent setbacks. We're not happy, Mr. Darmody. We took care of your little colored problem,  bought off the coast guard. We made a substantial investment with you--  - With his father. And we've yet to see a dime. Every business has its kinks. But I assure you-- you lost $70,000 of our money in that explosion. Man 2 :  An entire warehouse full of alcohol. That's not a kink. That's a torpedo hitting the Lusitania. It's a matter of discretion, James. Discretion and return on capital. And you're going to get it. We'll make good. It's just a matter of him and I-- Too many people talking! We'd prefer to discuss this with the commodore. He's given me complete authority. I never heard that. Then you weren't paying attention! Is he dead? Or just dying? My father is fine. Man 2 :  Listen, son. You're trying to diddle the wrong men. Yeah? You gonna drum me out of your yacht club? It's high time you and your whole goddamned generation learned something about respect. You just taught me plenty. Gentlemen. What the hell are you doing? f*ck these people! These people are financing the entire operation. I'm done with them. Who said it was your decision? I don't see anyone else in charge. I brought you in on this! Oh, you did? Thank you. Now stay the f*ck outta my business. Hmm. Thank you for the lift. (Screeches) Gillian :  What did they say about your father? They know something's wrong. And they questioned you, berated you. And then Jackson-- You know Parkhurst? I know all of them, dear. How well? No one is allowed to do this to you. It's $70,000. That's nothing to men like that. Plus Horvitz in Philly? He keeps hocking me for his booze. You will not be disrespected and you have to make that clear. All right, ma. "All right, leave me alone"? Or "all right, I understand what needs to be done"? Both. John D. Rockefeller was born on a farm. His father was a bigamist and a confidence man. His mother was a saint. Now he's worth $1 billion. And how is he spending his Memorial Day? He's not pumping oil. (Growling) (Barks) Go on now. Go! Hey! No, don't! (Soft growling) Come on now. Good boy. Hey, I need that back! I need that mask! Look at this. I'm like a lobster. Chase a little ball around in the sun? Idiotic. (Whispers) Where is Owen? Dropping off Harry Daugherty. Why? Your brother's here. In the conservatory. You let him in? What else could I do? It'll be fine. How many places have you lived in? Since you moved out of the house? Eight? Nine? What difference does it make? I had the upstairs apartment on Monroe, a little bungalow with June, and the place we got now. I was there for Christmas. The last time we spoke... There was an offer made. The offer's gone. See? That's it. Pfft! No conversation. Only orders. I'm your brother, Nucky. Then I love you. Now unless you have something to say,  aside from the fact that God distributes his gifts unequally,  this conversation is over. I know who's gonna testify against you. It doesn't matter. I just played golf with the Attorney General of the United States. Think about what that means. You are one nasty prick. And you're a frightened little boy with no place else to go. So give me something else and we can talk. Give me something else-- and I'll know you're my brother. The commodore is out of the game. He's had a stroke. They're trying to keep it under wraps. Who are "they"? The kid and his mother. They're in over their heads, Nuck. They can't see past their own-- resentment? She's batty. I mean I don't blame her. But that whole situation? It was never right. And that was my fault? Of course not. You did what you had to do-- taking care of me, Pop. I know that. And Mabel. Yeah. Poor Mabel. I made a mistake, Nuck. I admit it. I don't know what to say. I don't know what to f*ckin' do. Here I am. All right. We'll sort it out. (Sobbing) But there is something I have to ask of you. Anything, Nuck. I need you to get on your knees. Bend down to the ground and kiss my f*cking shoes, you piece of sh1t. What? You come crawling back here because you don't have the balls to finish what you started. f*ck that little cocksucker you call a partner. f*ck his conniving c**t of a mother. f*ck that old man. I'll see his corpse in a ditch. And f*ck you,  brother! (Both grunting) Enough. Get out of this house. Pop-- I don't give a f*ck. (Panting) In the future, if you're going to point a gun at someone, make sure it's loaded. Is this to be our life? Hey. Don't be hiding there. No no, come on now. This way. (Barking) Hush yourself! Don't hit him. Well, he's quiet now. Banging around an awful lot out there. Bad for the varmints. I'm sorry. (Growls) Sit on down now before you chase 'em all off. Go on now, give it to him. That itch? Sometimes. Don't half doubt it. Tree rat? He means squirrel. No, thank you. You a revenue agent? Then here. Uh, very strong. Made it myself. Have some more. Now I'm Glenmore. This is Pete. Richard Harrow. Where are you from, Richard? I live in Atlantic City. That's a sight to see, I'm told. You've never been? It must be 30 miles. Pete :  I was once. Saw a flying horse. That was some kind of trick. Well, it looked real to me. You're an easily-bamboozled individual. Oh, lay off your pontificating. What brings you out here, Richard? I was hunting. I left my things by a pond. Which pond now? I'm not sure. Well, that's how one mistake leads to another. (Growls) Shh. Well, we're gonna eat something. You probably should too. Here's to flying horses. 
 
 (Music playing) Sorry to keep you boys waiting. Been crawling through the underbrush? Too much sun this morning. Say hello to your new prosecutor. You must be Charles. Call me chip, Mr. Thompson. Chip. Harry tells me you're a man I can count on. I'd certainly like to think so. So you've talked? Mr. Thorogood and I have begun a discussion. He's, uh, fairly new to the courtroom. I hope that's not going be an issue. Daugherty :  Only if you don't know where the judge sits. He's the one in the robe, right? (Snickers) Very droll. I need to know how this will work. Well, the U.S. attorney here  presents a motion to transfer to federal court. Under the argument that the election-rigging charges and the Mann act violation constitute an ongoing criminal enterprise operating across state lines. And thus within the purview of the third circuit. What happens then? We go before our judge. He buys the humble wares which we set before him, and then Mr. Thorogood  brings all of his legal acumen and youthful energy to bear. Fortunately for us-- The department of justice determines it's simply not worth the time and resources to prosecute your case, which is dropped. We're swamped with Volstead as it is. You're not saying thank you. I need a guarantee. (Chuckles) You're not gonna get one. Just remember, this was your idea. All right. Ah, I have an early train. Sorry to hear it. We're free all evening. Richard : What should I do with the bones? Don't give 'em to him. He'll choke. What's his name? He's not mine. He just comes around. He knows who he is. He's an old soldier who just keeps on fighting. Don't you, boy? For what? Glenmore :  What's that? What does he fight for? You're gonna have to ask him. Now what's your pleasure, Glenmore? I'm of a mind to sleep out tonight. I'm going home I guess. You're gettin' soft. What about you, Richard? I should get back to town. How you aim to do that? I don't know. I got the Ford parked not a hundred yards away. Say, Richard. I'm out in these woods a lot. People come out here, they get up to all kinds of foolishness. That's not what these woods is for. You understand me? These woods is for hunting and fishing, seeing what the birds get up to. These woods are for living. Understand me there? Yes. All right then. Boy :  You can fix it, right? Your old pop can fix anything. Does your throat still hurt? This medicine helps. (Knocks) I'm not eating, June. Eli, it's George. Can I talk to you? Ho there, Patrick. I'm Brian. Sure okay. You know what we need for this, Bri? A veeblefetzer. The left-handed kind. Do we have one? Huh-uh. Mr. Dean across the street, tell him I asked. Scoot. (Door closes) We're alone, right? What's it look like? I dunno. You got a lot of kids. I don't store 'em in the garage. There's a rumor going around. The commodore-- you know? I don't know. That he-- apoplexy. He's like a log or something. He can't even take a piss by himself. Not true, George. I saw him this morning. We had breakfast. Eggs... bacon. The man loves his bacon. It's all on track. Maybe we should go over there? Bother him this hour? Just to be sure. I mean after you had breakfast, you never know. I'm with the kid now, George. Right. So I'll go over. Are you listening to what I'm saying? I heard,  but think it through. If the commodore's not-- I just told you-- - If he can't protect us from your brother, I have to say it, we're all in a very exposed-- what are you doing? Huh? You're moving towards me. All I want you to do is take a second-- - It's true, isn't it? Absolutely not. Oh Jesus, it is true. Oh, so now it's what, you and Jimmy? This was the plan? Son of a bitch. Okay, George? Hey, let go of me. I'm not gonna do anything. Then let go-- let go! Look, keep it down, my family-- That's it, I'm out. I want out. Look, all I'm asking for-- let go. If you don't let go, there's gonna be trouble. George. I'm saying it now-- I'll go straight to Nucky, I will. I'll tell the world-- George, shut the f*ck up! (Gasping, wheezing) Oh f*ck. Oh f*ck! Yeah. All right. Okay okay. Brian :  Dad! Dad! He doesn't have one. Huh? The thing you asked for-- he never heard of it. Uh... So... You need to go back to the house. (Hacks) My throat. I don't want you catching this. How's your head feeling? Like I won another round with that car door. You need to pay more attention. That's why it's called an accident, Ange. The things you said at the ceremony, did you mean them? I'm here. With you. Our son's asleep in his bed. Nobody's hungry. Nobody's scared. What else is there? There's gotta be something. Hasn't there? (Knocks) Is there a reason not to answer it? I don't think so. (Door opens) Richard. We missed you this morning. The dedication for the memorial. I wasn't interested in that. You all right? I should talk to Jimmy. We're okay, Ange. Where were you today? I needed to take a walk. I should've gone with you. We're both back now. Are you up for a job tonight? Is there a problem, Richard? Would you fight for me? Of course I would. Right down to the last bullet. Then let's go to work. (Screwing cap on) (Bottle thuds) (Soft music playing) Mr. Parkhurst? Would you like your cocoa in here this evening? Upstairs as usual. Half an hour. Yes sir. You know what this is, Alexander? A sioux Indian breech cloth. I've been hunting one down for years. It doesn't cover much, does it? (Chuckles) No. They come charging at you practically bare-assed, waving one of those clubs. Thought they could stop bullets with magic. Foolish. Fine bead work though! Yes sir. Damn fool savages. Fetch you in 30 minutes, Mr. Parkhurst. Alexander, on second thought I will have the cocoa. What--? What is-- oh! What? I'm gonna teach you something now. Ah! Ow. Who the hell are you? A soldier. No! (Muffled screams) (Woman screams) (Gasps) Jesus, Mary and Joseph. Sorry, ma'am. Did you hear something too? What do you mean? Someone screaming. No, I heard you out here. Is something wrong? The children are fine. I... I just felt-- it's been a strange day. You should get back to bed. Good night, ma'am. Lady of the manor? Keep your voice down. It wasn't me who screamed. I couldn't help it. Well, I'll not do it again, if that's what you'd prefer. Out there snooping around-- probably thinks I'm pinching the silverware. I should too, what she pays me. Tight with a pound, is she? That's just the tip of it. She made me call her family in New York, and they didn't want anything to do with her. Hard luck. You shouldn't be in my room at this hour. I shouldn't be in your room at all. But what's the sense in doing something half wrong? Please don't get me into trouble. I'd never dare. Halloran : I can't see anything, Eli. What is it you need to see? Whatever it is I'm doing. Jesus! Is it somebody I know? It's Mary Pickford. You killed Mary Pickford? Help me get this in the car, then you can go. (Groans) (Music playing) (Distant laughter) (Loud laughter, music) Eddie, right? Ja.  - Could you go find us some cold champagne and some ice water and some oysters? Girl : Big ones. (Laughing) Shut the door, counselor. (Crickets chirping) (Music playing)
