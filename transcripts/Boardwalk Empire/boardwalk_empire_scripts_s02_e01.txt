 In less than two hours, liquor will be declared illegal  by decree of our nation's congress. 
 To those beautiful, ignorant bastards. 
 ( cheers ) 
 You're placing Enoch Thompson  at the head of a criminal organization controlling Atlantic county. 
 Torrio :  Arnold Rothstein and Charlie Luciano. 
 I have a load coming in tomorrow. 500 crates Canadian Club. 
 You use your own men for the pickup. 
 Jimmy Darmody. 
 Al Capone. 
 Drop your weapon. 
 Get 'em up. 
 Jimmy left me holding the bag. 
 Is this the way you do business? 
 My husband, he has a weakness for the dice games. 
 This should see you through winter. 
 Give me that money. 
 ( screams ) 
 I'm investigating Saturday night's shootings. 
 We can all rest now that the architect  of that slaughter has been killed himself. 
 You're out, Mickey. Out of the business. 
 Chalky White's taking over. 
 What am I supposed to tell my partners? 
 He drives a packard you said. 
 But it wasn't Chalky. 
 You hung a fella [i]that works for him. Let's go. You're under arrest. These here are my daddy tools. What are you gonna do with them? It wasn't the klan. The roads to Atlantic City are rivers of mud. We need paved highways so cars can come and go. Mrs. Schroeder is here. Who's Mrs. Schroeder? Don't move! You're sure these are the guys who held you up? Absolutely. D'Alessio brothers. They're being backed by Rothstein and Luciano. They shot my brother, Mickey. They shot at me. You are consorting with the man who killed the father of your children. Run somebody else for mayor. Nucky :  What do I do about Eli? Replace him too. I'm dying. There's no time to be sentimental. Accept Jesus as your savior. This morning I found this hidden in his rubbish pail. You gonna arrest her or not, sheriff? He's not. Go far away. What's your name, handsome? Nelson. You know I'm about to be indicted for fixing the world series. I need a man with your political reach to quash the indictment. That could be arranged. In exchange for what? The times with you and the children,  I've never been happier. You made me pregnant. You have to trust me, Eli. What does that mean? That blood is thicker than water. Commodore :  You're my  flesh and blood, boy.  - So? So you're gonna take back Atlantic City for the both of us. ( theme music playing ) Man :  Here you go, boss. Coming your way. ( men chattering ) ( music playing ) Man 2 :  Come on, let's go! All right, I got it, I got it. I got one. Come on, guys.  Come on. Here you go. Come on, fellas. Watch your back.

( gun cocks ) ( gunfire ) ( shouting ) ( coughing ) Woman :  Mama! ( crying ) Man :  The casing's jammed! Come on. Come on! It's jammed. Go on, get in there. Just pop that out. Hand me that. Woman :  Holy jesus! Man :  Shut up, shut up! Purity, sobriety, And the white Christian’s Jesus. ( gun cocks ) ( man moaning ) My arm! Get up. Let's get out of here, come on. Klansman :  My f*cking arm. Get him up here. Get him up here, Charlie. Get him up here. Come on! Oh, my arm! Get up, get up. One of them shot me in the arm, God damn it. Go go. Go go! Come on, move it! ( groans ) Teddy :  I don't want to go.  - Margaret:  I am not in the mood for this, Teddy. Come out. ( baby crying ) I don't want to! Margaret :  I will count to three: One, two, three. Teddy. Teddy :  I don't want to. I am warning you, do not turn your back on me, young man. Come here. Mama. Come out from there. You're upsetting your sister. No! You're home. Be it ever so humble. What's the problem? Why is he under there? He doesn't want to go to school. You want to grow up to be a fishmonger? Yes! No, you don't. You want to be a doctor or something, remember? Like Dr. Surran. Sister Bernice-- He was misbehaving apparently and she took the ruler to him. What did you do? I didn't do anything. Well, nuns don't just go around hitting people.- She pulled my hair. A nun hit me when I was your age, I'd get another whipping from my dad. Go with Katy, dear. Wash up. You too. This way, sweethearts. Come on. It's nearly 8:00 a.m. Considering the night I had, I'm amazed I'm home before 9:00. I'm sure. But you do look ravishing. And ravishable. Katy :  Time for school. Come on. Teddy :  I'm not going! Katy :  Yes, you are going. Come on. Teddy :  I don't want to! Katy :  Let's get your coat. Emily :  Mama! Teddy :  I'm not going! I told you. Where are you going? To the office to get some sleep. Katy :  Do you want your mommy upset? Teddy :  No, I told you! Emily :  Mama! Teddy! ( gulls cawing ) These eggs taste funny. Maybe someone made the chicken laugh. Oh, there's my handsome man. Hey, pal. Daddy! ( tommy babbles ) Nucky called? Was he supposed to? I'll take some ham and some eggs. Oh, well, I know how he likes them, dear. You want to go shoot some gulls? Yeah. Jimmy. What? He's too young. No, I'm not. I was his age, I used to go all the time. Younger, with your father. Actually it was with Nucky mostly. I don't think it's safe. Tommy :  Please! Please please. Jimmy : Come on. He's a big boy. Relax, Ange. You worry too much. Tommy :  Please! Make sure he dresses warmly. All right, come on, let's go. Your plaid pants. Got it. You got it? And be careful. Are we gonna shoot some real seagulls with real guns? Yes, we are. I really wish you wouldn't do that. Do what, dear? Undercut me. Oh, sweetie, I would never. You're his wife. Yes, and I'm Tommy's mother. ( faintly ) No problem. I was only trying to help, dear-- as your husband's mother. Boys will be boys, after all. You know, when Jimmy was a baby and I would change his diaper... I used to kiss his little winkie. ( men grunting ) What is the meaning of this?! Move this furniture back into place! Sir, we weren't expecting you, sir. Mrs. Van Alden wanted to see the office. The field reports, we were just about to hop to it. I take almost no comfort in "about to," agent Clarkson. Yes sir. Van Alden : Gentlemen, I'd like to introduce my wife. Dear, these are agents Sawicki and Clarkson. Ma'am. How do you do? Agent Sawicki is of polish stock. He joins us  from Mt. Olivet. Outside Pittsburgh. Yes, they have a large Christian community. Mrs. Van Alden is visiting for the weekend. Well, there's no shortage of wholesome entertainment. I picked up this tourist guide Yesterday. Oh. Does it list the churches? Clarkson :  I assume so. I haven't read it yet. Oh. Consider it a gift. Thank you. If I'm needed, we're staying at the hotel Metropole. Though I anticipate we'll be out mostly, taking in the sights. Save the roughhouse for your own time, gentlemen. Both : Yes sir. ( music playing ) ( giggling, chatting ) Man : That's a fine how-do-you-do. Woman : It's so hot. I could just come down on the weekend. It's just gonna be another minute. What's hurting him now? He's got an earache. Mr. Torrio's a man beset by convenient maladies. What's that mean? Nothing cures him faster than someone else doing his laundry. I ain't his washerwoman. ( chuckles ) Don't take it personally, kid. What do you think George Remus spent five years doing? Come again? I said what do you think George Remus was doing for him? Ain't you George Remus? Who'd you think I was? You just said it like it was someone else. Torrio : This shyster-- had him on a $500 retainer, keep me out of the hoosegow. Cheaper lawyer, more time in jail. Why the f*ck you move to Cincinnati? Well, John, draw a circle 300 miles around, know what you get? 300 miles of cowshit. ( laughter ) And 80% of the bonded whiskey being stored in this country. How much's in your pocket? Enough to float your speaks, plus a whole lot more. We're looking to keep business steady-- no heartburn, No blood on the floor. Buy from George Remus, there won't be any. Remus owns the distilleries and the pharmacies they're allowed to sell to. Even better, Remus owns the trucks that hijack his own liquor. That's a neat trick. No trick, my boy. Remus read the Volstead Act very closely. We oughta be in business with him. The f*ck you talking about?  He's  Remus. I know. I'm just-- 4,000 cases a month. You're good for eight easy. Let's see how it goes. Buying from Canada, john? Makes sense. But you never know what can happen on that lake. As for Atlantic City, Cincinnati's a lot closer. And who really likes Nucky Thompson anyway? I take it Remus doesn't. A man lays out two grand for a weekend on the shore, he doesn't expect an altercation over the telephone bill. Well, it's all on the house here, Georgie. Go say hello to Odette. ( moans ) We'll work out the details later. Hi. When you go to Atlantic City-- when am I doing that? Next month, before you head to Brooklyn. Johnny, I got this thing for my father. So leave a day early. Go see Nucky, tell him things have changed. That's it? You'll think of something. Yeah, your f*cking laundry. Straight through Gloucester county, all you can get.  Me and the boys here are gobbling it all up. It's pennies an acre. ( irish accent ) Because it's worthless land. Not for long. The road appropriations come through, we steer the planning commissioners right where we want them. With the old golden handshake? Well, how does anything get done, Ernie? Once that's settled, we sell the land back to the great state of New Jersey. At a tenfold profit. So how does a fella get a piece? Quickly, my boy, quickly. The blue plots are all taken. Jesus, you fellas own all that? Not all, but most. ( all chuckle ) Land barons of barren land. And it gets even better. Once the roads are approved, they're gonna need to be built, right? It just so happens I have a very close friend in the construction business. Edward Bader, master builder. Yeah, with his own two hands. ( laughs ) And you, my friend, are hereby notified we are currently accepting bids to supply the gravel. For 40 miles of road? You can do the math yourself. I will. But in the meantime, let this pave the way in my direction. Well, it's a fine start. Perfect, Ernie. We're all set for McGarrigle? My house Monday night. You're a credit to the cause, Nucky. Always happy to help. Nucky, we have an emergency. There's a reporter calling. He claims Chalky White has shot a klansman. Get my brother-- I have already called him. Barker :  Right here on the Atlantic City boardwalk, for over 40 years... Boy :  Five more minutes? They have a hotel shaped like an elephant. It's in Margate-- six stories. It's quite something. The tusks are genuine ivory apparently. Beg your pardon? The elephant. We can take a drive. Oh no. Thank you. Who was that? No one of any consequence. If you're hungry, there's a soda fountain. They sell potato cakes called kor-nishes. ( gasps ) What's wrong? This guide-- It lists the taverns, the houses of ill-repute. "If Jesus came to Atlantic City..." The places he  wouldn't  go. The author's attempt at cynicism. I'm sorry you had to see that, dear. Maybe it's better we don't have children. This world, Nelson. 
 
 ( piano playing ) Are you sure I can't offer you gentlemen luncheon? Oh, thank you, Lenore, no. We need some privacy, dear. Lester baby? It's very nice, Lester. Talented. Thank you, sir. Lester will be attending Morehouse in two years. The college. Jesus Christ, what the f*ck happened? It don't matter now, does it? I took care of it my own self. You shot a white man in the throat. Which I had to hear about from some f*cking reporter. Hermanacus, he's a schoolteacher. The other one lost his arm. I've got four boys dead in that warehouse. Half a dozen wounded-- including a woman. You know I'll take care of it. How I know that? We're supposed to be protected from these ofays. Look, I can't control-- No, you look! I'm done with this  sh1t. Just like that, huh? I got my family and I got my people. Your people? The 10,000 black folk who make this city hum. Busboys, trash collectors, porters. Meaning what exactly? Meaning... you go school these crackers, Lest you all find out. You do understand I'm the only thing keeping you from a lynch mob? Are you ready for what happens here I turn up on the end of a rope? Nucky :  Things go that way,  your people have a lot more to lose than I do. You gonna arrest me or not? I can handle this for now. Stay in the f*cking house. You can see yourselves out. This klan sh1t, Eli, I thought you had it under control. That is one uppity shine. Sister Bernice? I'm Margaret Schroeder, Teddy's mother. I stopped by the convent. They told me I could find you here. Much quieter this time of day. Ben Franklin... Apparently he discovered lightning. Have a seat. Thank you no. My son. Mm-hmm. He came home yesterday with bruises. Where I struck him with a ruler. Did he tell you why he was punished? No, not specifically. What did he tell you? That he did nothing wrong. Then you're raising a liar, Mrs. Schroeder. He was playing with matches... in a coat closet in a school full of children. I-- I don't know what to say. You're a widow, Is that right? I am. And you live with Teddy's uncle? Is my son to be expelled? No. Father Brennan intervened. Apparently he's close with your Mr. Thompson. Thank you for seeing me. Eli : We agreed we were gonna put him out of business, but this-- it's f*cking madness. They had to shoot a woman? Did you mollycoddle the enemy in France, Jimmy? He cut off a man's finger. They were champing at a bit. 10,000 coloreds up in arms now. The klan boys are in our corner. There's a lot more than 10,000 of them. What am I supposed to tell Nucky? Nucky Thompson was weaned on my teat! I know him backwards and forwards. Governor Edwards, he hates the b*st*rd more than I do. They're ready, him and his people? Will you stop worrying, for god's sake? I need to know what's going on, Lou! The less you know the better. Well, that's just peachy, isn't it? Worry about yourself, Eli. I'll handle Nucky. I gotta go. Commodore :  Some men, I'll tell you. You give 'em a badge and a gun, a county treasurership, they think they have power. Soon you'll see what real power is. How soon? I want you to start laying some groundwork-- Meet the governor, cultivate relationships; New York, Philly; alcohol's the key. What about here? Chalky's out of the game, that's a pretty good start. Got that whole warehouse that's there for the taking. Jimmy. Don't worry about Nucky. I'm not. Hmm. Look around, boy. These animals? Beasts. Any one of 'em could've torn me to pieces. But they didn't. This fucker, he was a giant. 600lbs, over seven feet tall. I tracked him for three hours. Finally cornered him in a ravine. He smelled me,  started comin' closer. The son of a bitch got confident, thought I was scared. Reared up on me, puffed up his chest and let out a roar. I blasted him right in the gut. Bled out, looking up at me right in the eyes,  almost like he couldn't believe it. You'll be judged by what you succeed at, boy, not by what you attempt. Nucky :  Last night, four fine young boys  were murdered by men claiming to represent the race of white American Christians. Woman : Christians?! I will not speak the name of that so-called organization within this house of god. Congregation :  That's right. Yeah.  - Amen. But I can assure you, as treasurer of Atlantic county, and more personally as someone who has always regarded the members of our colored community as his friends and equals, that neither I, sheriff Thompson, or any of his men will rest until these hooded cowards are brought to justice, and the message is sent loud and clear... that no one need fear For their safety, or the safety of their wives, children, or property in the face of the obstreperous negro. Man 1 : That's right. Man 2 : Yes sir. These coloreds need to learn a lesson, and we are going to teach it with, dare I say in these sacred confines, an iron fist? I just come from St. Mark's! Herman Dacus just died from his neck wound. ( murmuring ) It happened. Eli, find Chalky and place him under arrest-- for his own safety. Friends, please please. Remain calm! Good afternoon, welcome to preston's. How do you do? Are we celebrating a special occasion? Our 13th wedding anniversary. Well, that's lucky. How so? Lucky 13. Are we ready to order? The lady will have the mutton chops. And for the gentlemen? Steak. Turtle soup to start. And will we be imbibing, sir? I beg your pardon? Something to drink perhaps? For the occasion. We can accommodate most requests. The lady will have coffee. I'll have a glass of cold buttermilk. Ma'am. Nelson, he was offering alcohol. I realize that, dear. Well, aren't you going to arrest him? We're here to eat dinner. Of course... But... Pardon me, dear. I need to wash up-- Public spaces. Woman :  Yes, she told me. Yes, I know. I'm so sorry. It was just so awful. I'm so sorry. Thank you. I'm so glad you came here. Mrs. Dacus, I am so sorry for your loss. Thank you, Nucky. He was a pillar of the community and will be sorely missed. Thank you, Nucky. Thank you. Would you excuse us? What are you doing here? I came to pay my respects. Politics is my department. He was one of my high school teachers. So? So what? Yesterday morning At Chalky's. I was gone. It happened after we left. You saw nothing that aroused your suspicion? Let me go do this. It's an awful waste of a lot of good tablecloths. The laundry bills alone. So how's Chalky? Alive, which is the main thing. So you run off and get married like a thief in the night? You sound like my mother. What happened? You used to ask my advice on things. My own kid is practically shaving, Nuck. He like the new place? I took him shooting. Fishing too. Oyster creek, like we used to. When I was sheriff. I used to love that. Standing there for hours, not saying a word. Is there anything now? That you want to say? What do you mean? Your father is a very duplicitous man. You've been told. I told my mother I'd be over for dinner. Would you care for some butterscotch pudding? I'm afraid I'm too full. I got you something. Nelson. I thought you didn't believe in gifts. I saw it and I thought of you. Oh, it's lovely. Thank you. Sir? How may I help you? You mentioned earlier about this being a special occasion. Indeed. Have you any champagne? Whiskey perhaps? We do, sir. Nelson! It's all right, dear. Everybody stay seated. This is a raid! All staff members kneel on the floor, hands interlocked atop your heads. Agent Clarkson. Yes sir? Van Alden :  Secure the contents of the cash drawer. I want the money counted and documented with an official forfeiture receipt. Agent Sawicki, break down that door. Woman : Oh my god. Van Alden :  This establishment is being shuttered for violation of the Volstead Act. It is loaded, sir. There is over 200 cases of brandy, wine and champagne. Tag it, catalog it and destroy it. What's your name? Carl Switzer. Mr. Switzer, you are hereby under arrest for violation of the Volstead Act. Agent Sawicki? ( thumping, squeaking ) Right here, this section. The springs are broken. No wonder you're not sleeping. Mmm. We could go to your rooming house. Men only, dear. I'm afraid it's not nearly as luxurious. I'm very proud of you, Nelson. Hmm. The way you handled those men. ( nervous chuckle ) It's what I'm paid for, dear. It was thrilling, actually. I'm not embarrassed to say it. ( moaning ) Uh-- huh? Oh. ( moaning continues ) You're being awfully quiet. I saw Jimmy. Oh? And how are the newlyweds getting along? Fine, I suppose. He was alone. We need to send them something. I already took care of it. What is it? He's holding something back. When he was a kid, he confided in me-- everything. Where was his father? He was here. Disinterested. The commodore needs to be in control. 10-year-old boy? There's no controlling that. Now of course, he's around. You're jealous. I'm angry. He's got something up his sleeve. I was father and mother to that kid, with Gillian out all hours? I nursed him through malaria, took him camping, gave him the run of that goddamn boardwalk. There is another boy down the hall. He was playing with matches. Matches. I saw the sister. She told me. Did you speak to him? He offered no explanation. I'm afraid he's developed a fascination with fire. What's that all about? P.A. :  Now boarding all points west... Woman : Come on, dear. Did you have a nice time? I did. Although I suppose I've been kidding myself to think I could live here. Sodom by the sea. I miss you, Nelson. Until next month. Thank you for a lovely weekend. Travel safely and with God. Man :  Porter, porter! P.A. :  Now boarding for all points north: New York, Mount Vernon, White Plains and Pleasantville. Just in time. I could smell it from upstairs. It smells good. Who was on the telephone? My father. He and my mother are gonna take Tommy to the carousel. What's this? Oh, from Nucky. A wedding gift. Should we open it? Is there any coffee? It's on the boil. Thank you. The coloreds, they won't give us any trouble? The earlier we get there, the quieter it will be. You don't have to feel embarrassed to eat in front of us, Richard. Why don't you take some biscuits for later? How's that coffee, Ange? How does it feel to have everything? Hey, kiddo. What are you up to in here? Playing soldier. I'd like to talk to you. Yes sir. What are you doing? Getting ready for the belt. No no, Teddy, I'm not going to beat you. You need to mind your mother. And the sisters at school. Yes sir. And no more misbehaving, playing with matches. Run along now-- the sweetshop. And be a good boy. Thank you. ( rattling ) ( music playing softly ) ♪ every night they say a little prayer for me ♪
