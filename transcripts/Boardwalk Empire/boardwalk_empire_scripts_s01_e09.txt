 There was a hijacking in the woods last January. 
 Nobody was supposed to get hurt. 
 Then why did they? 
 I can give you the ringleader. You can just ask him. 
 What's his name? 
 Jimmy Darmondy. 
 Somehow, James, we've all been managing to get along without you. 
 Your family as well. 
 Angela : Nucky Thompson didn't get where he is by being naive. 
 He could stop giving me money. 
 What about Jimmy? 
 Angela : I would have thought he'd send something. I told you no doctors, damn it. Maybe you got worms. Nucky Thompson come by? No sir, he sent Mr. Boyd on by with your envelope. Getting too big for his britches. What is this obsession with this Schroeder character? You requisitioned the immigration file on his wife? I've been waiting for a report on Mr. Darmondy. I'm with his wife right now. No you're not, Charlie. You're with his mother. I need you to come home, James. There are things I may require that I'm uncomfortable asking of Eli, particularly with the election coming. He invited me. The name should be on the list. Nucky : Tell me something else while you're at it. Like how you propose to take care of harding's lady trouble. Name's Nan Britton. I'll bring her to a.C. Put her up till November. I'm prepared to throw the Jersey delegation behind harding. You could wait in the hall. I don't like that fella. I never have. He's a good man, Halloran. What the hell are you doing? ( Groans ) There's been a incident. I prefer to rely only on you. ( Theme music playing ) Lolly : It's crazy. While it's happening you don't think you'll ever forget it. Then once it's over, you can barely recall a thing. But it's them, right? You're sure these are the guys who held you up? Absolutely. These three definitely. This is the little prick who spit in my face. The d'Alessio brothers... a family of dagos out of Philly. Second-story men who graduated to stick ups. They robbed bookbinder's in '17, the restaurant. Killed two customers, shot a waiter in the face. Jesus Christ. Little b*st*rd called me fat. Eli : They're f*cking killers, George. Sounds to me like you got off easy. Why, sure. I was just... I need to talk to my brother. Feel better, eh? These f*cking guineas... They're desperados, Nuck. We gotta track 'em down and squash 'em before they spill more blood. It's not just blood I'm worried about; it's ink. You see the paper today? June doesn't like to upset me. Fletcher, this reformer running for Mayor... He gave an interview alleging corruption in both the Mayor's and the sheriff's office. He mentioned me by name? "Has Mayor Bacharach even questioned what sheriff Eli Thompson was doing at an illegal casino at 3:00 A.M.?" So I was there. So what? How's he know I wasn't answering a call? Because he knows, Eli. Everybody does. It just never made the paper before. f*ck 'em. Let them write what they want. The election, Eli... We gotta keep the tide flowing in our direction. I'll get out then, press the flesh, drum up some support. What about your spleen? Dr. Surran says you should rest. How do you rest your spleen? Come on, Grant. That water was cold. Let's tell the ladies. Oh, that was amazing! Way out there. ( Chattering ) Do you believe in love at first sight, Mrs. Schroeder? It's a rather romantic notion. It happened to me the day I saw Warren. Senator Harding? I was 16, and he was the handsomest man I'd ever met. Of course he wasn't senator yet. He ran the newspaper back in Marion. Houdini's brother... His name is Hardeen. And when I first heard harding, I thought it was him running for president. He loves me and he loves his baby daughter. But America needs him and so I have to sacrifice. Marguerite. Good morning. Madame Jeunet. This is a friend of mine, miss Nan Britton. She needs a few outfits for the season. C'est gentil. We exist to oblige. Maryska. Maryska! See the mademoiselle to the dressing room. This way. A cow waiting to be milked... the Polish girl. No grace, no charm. Well, I imagine she's still learning. A head like a cabbage. But she will work for pennies. You see what I am reduced to? Is business slow, ma'am? My dear Marguerite, how you have blossomed. Mr. Thompson is quite generous with his attentions. He does treat me well. The finest things for the finest ladies, as it must be here. But the cost is very high,  and then on top I must pay. Pay whom? Mr. Thompson of course. Oh, you mean the city. I am told now I must pay double. Everyone must. I have saved nothing, Marguerite. All to run the shop. I am a woman alone. You understand this. Can you not speak with your alderman? You can speak for me... to the man who gives you his attention. I... I wouldn't know what to say. Say that he is handsome; How happy he makes you; And how can you buy the things that make you pretty for him if there is no belle femme? Help me, Marguerite. You have power you do not suspect. ( Door opens ) Oh bonjour, madame. Leave no stone unturned. You and your men wire every department from Philly to Pittsburgh. You should also write to... Nucky. Jesus. A little notice would've been nice. I sent a telegram. We have received nothing. I will call the Western union to complain. I'd offer you coffee, but it looks like you've already helped yourself. The train... the dining car was out of service. You haven't been home? I thought I should see you first. Have them send up a steak. Ja. So you're here. I assume you've accepted my offer? With conditions. My friend Richard harrow... You met him in Chicago. The man in the iron mask? He's a war hero. I'd like him to join me. What's under there? He's missing his cheekbone, his jaw. Basically the whole left side of his face is gone. And he's still alive? Medicine, huh? A lot of fellas still alive probably shouldn't be. Well, I know a few myself. The d'Alessio brothers out of Philly. Another condition: We keep what we discuss only between us. Wait outside. So these are the guys that robbed the casino? And O'Neill as well. Ignacious, Sixtus, Leo... They're all named after popes. Write the Vatican, When I find them... What do you want me to do? You need me to spell it out? I'd like to hear you say it. Why? Politician to the last, huh? What, you don't say it, you don't have to deny it later? Or are you just trying to kid yourself? About what? The fact that you're a murderer, Nuck. That is what you want me to do, right? Kill them? Yes. Even the kid? ( Sniffs ) I'm gonna go eat my steak. ( Knock on door ) ( Whistles ) Gentlemen. A.R. These are the fellas I told you about. This is Leo d'Alessio, his brother Ignacious. And Mickey Doyle. An honor, Mr. Rothstein. So you've heard of me. Naturally. Who ain't, huh? Yeah. And what is it you've heard? Good stuff, you know. That I'm honest? That you'll always get a square deal? Sure, that's why we're here. A reputation takes a lifetime to build and only seconds to destroy. I understand you're interested in the liquor business. We's interested in makin' dough. Piles of it. Eight ball, $500. You break. There are two ways to make money in the alcohol business. One is to take cheap rotgut whiskey, dilute it and sell it. I was doing good with that myself. That's the stupid way, There's a growing demand for good whiskey in the United States. And I'm not talking about the swill you stirred up in your chamberpot. I'm talking about the best scotch from Britain. There's a fortune to be made from importing it. It'll be the chic thing to have good whiskey when you have guests and the rich will vie with one another to serve it. I want to set up a business for importing scotch. We'll have ships with crews we can trust who'll sail it from the distilleries in Europe and unload it outside the three-mile limit. All we have to do is smuggle it ashore. That's where you mugs come in. The ports of Atlantic City are ideal for distribution to the entire eastern seaboard. The only problem is the man who runs that city. Normally I'd make a deal with such a man, cut him in as a partner, but I find Nucky Thompson to be greedy and unreasonable. Nothing a bullet in the eye won't fix. ( Mickey giggles ) If you'll each sign those forms, I'll take it as your acquiescence to our new arrangement. What are they? Luciano : Life insurance policies. There's a half a million on each of you. Rothstein : You'll be handling large amounts of my money, gentlemen. It's my assurance you won't chisel me. Think of it as an incentive  not to screw things up. ( Speaks Italian ) I'll show you out. Do you know what the nice thing is about the Bronx zoo, Charlie? There's bars between you and the monkeys. Finally asleep. I could've read them some more of this. You seem to be enjoying it yourself. "The wonderful love magnet... As long as I carry it, every living thing I meet will love me dearly." That would make your election easier, wouldn't it? Certainly cheaper. Is winning expensive? Not as expensive as losing. And will Mr. harding be president? That depends. Are you planning to vote for him? I've perhaps seen him in not the most flattering light. You mean the girl. Her name is Nan. If we only elected good men, we'd never have leaders. If not good, then what should they be? Useful... to those who support them. I was speaking with madame Jeunet today. Oh? She says she's going to lose the shop. It's a pricey location. Apparently she's having trouble with the city. Then she should talk to her alderman. She did. It didn't help. Maybe there's something the county treasurer could do. Did she ask you to bring this up? No. Then why are we discussing it? She showed me a kindness and I thought to return it. I made her hire you, Margaret. Kindness didn't come into it. Then you should recompense her for the burden you made her carry. What did she tell you exactly? Only that the money she pays has increased and it's more than she can afford. Then she shouldn't be doing business in Atlantic City, Because that's what it costs. But if you set the price... Margaret, this is not a suitable topic. I wasn't aware of that. You're aware now. Will you not be staying I have an early meeting. ( Piano music playing ) ( Door opens, closes ) I painted this last October. She was an actress in the vaudeville. Huh. It's pretty. This... There's a lyrical quality. It's reminiscent of Mary Cassatt. ( Clears throat ) Do you think your friend is visiting soon? The art dealer? Oh, he's abroad at the moment... Paris. The city of light. ( Grunts, laughs ) ( Gasps ) Oh, God damn it. I broke the cork. Here. ( Cork pops ) There. Oh my, you uncivilized artists. Laughing ) 1918... That's the year we met you. L right, save some for your jealous husband. ( Laughing ) Mm. Come. It's okay, darling. I don't bite. I, uh... Everyone in Paris is doing it. ( Door rattles ) Jimmy : Hello? ( Knocking ) Ange? ( Door rattling ) Angela, it's me. Hello? It's Jimmy. It's me. Why is the door locked? We've had intruders in the neighborhood. Where's the baby? He's sleeping. Jimmy, my God. You're having a party? We're just visiting. May I pour you some wine? I heard that's against the law w. Well, it is getting late and, uh, you have that sitting in the morning. Oh yes. A wedding portrait. Lithuanian couple. Well, it was nice to see you, old boy. Welcome home again. ( Record scratching ) You should have told me you were coming. I did. Goddamn Western union! What... what are you doing? I'm kissing you. Wait... You show up out of nowhere, not a phone call for months... Ange, look, I'm home okay? For good. You're hurting me! I missed you. ( Sighs ) Van Alden : Yes, I will. Thank you for bringing this to my attention. They only had the plain ones... That was Western Union. They just got a call from Nucky Thompson's Butler inquiring about a wire from James Darmody. They said it was passed on to you. Oh my God. What is the meaning of this? I have it here. I was going to give it to you. Then why didn't you? "Arriving Thursday, 11:00 A.M. train." That was yesterday. I'm sorry, it slipped my mind. You're either incompetent or a liar. I won't stand for it either way, Agent Sebso. We've been so... I will not stand for it either way! Why was this hidden? Because I'd like to keep my job. Supervisor Elliot... He thinks we're being obsessive about the Hans Schroeder case, about Nucky Thompson. We have a witness that can place Darmody at the scene of the murders. I wasn't thinking. You kill a snake by cutting off the head, Agent Sebso. The supervisor? Nucky Thompson! Darmody gives him up, this entire city, this Sodom, will be cleansed all at once. Jimmy : There's coal in the ground,  lumber in the forests, cattle in the fields. What sound does the cow make? Moo! That's right. You ride that train, you look out the window, you don't see anything but opportunity from coast to coast. And now he's returned to this one. And now I'm home, Ange, where I belong. When you feel like showing up. I had business out west. I told you, but that's... that's all taken care of. So now what? Now our prospects are looking up. Nucky made me an offer. Assistant clerk? Let's just say that we're out of this dump in no time flat. Marven gardens, those beach houses on Ventnor... How does that sound? ( Phone ringing ) Hello? Okay okay. Sweetie, come here. Yeah, just keep him there. Bye. Mush! No, no mush today. Eggs. Who was that? It was my mother. I got to go see her. Come on, champ. What are you doing? I'm making more coffee. ( Match strikes, stove lights ) Let's have another baby. What do you say? You want a little brother, c? Yeah! Yeah? Then it's settled. Your stomach is growling. Are you hungry? I wouldn't mind eating you for lunch. Maybe for dessert. ( Door opens ) Got any coffee left? I can manage that. ( Music playing ) Oh! f*ck! I wasn't sure if you took cream. ( Cup clatters ) It's not there, dear. You f*cking twat. Hey! That's my mother you're talking to. My apologies. So you're Luciano. My mother told me a lot about you. We're very close, Charles. Plus we have a mutual friend in Chicago. Al Capone says hello. That's a lot of baloney. Capone's no pal of mine. You're right. Actually he didn't say hello. He said I should blow your f*cking brains out. I'd consider it a great favor if you didn't. Get dressed. We're gonna take a ride. To where? Someplace they won't find you. Jimmy : Come on, move it. It don't gotta be like this, you know? Tell Nucky I'll talk to a.R., call off the d'Alessios. What? We'll cut him in. There's plenty to go around for every... Drop the gun! Now. ( Gun clatters ) ( Luciano laughing ) James Darmody, you're under arrest. What are you smiling at? You fellas. Youse are a sight for sore eyes. Hands on the wall. f*ck. ( Gun clatters ) Mid-July and they're all over the place already. How am I supposed to compete with this guy? That's the spirit, Mr. Mayor. I want these placards taken down. Any shop that posts one gets a $25 fine. Can we do that? We can do whatever we want. When's Eli coming back? Stitches opened up. Doc Surran said this'll probably set him back another month. It gets better and better, doesn't it? He's left a big void, I'll tell you that. He's not dead, Halloran. I know, but the men, the other deputies, they're gonna need some guidance... Schedules, assignments, that kind of thing. Can't Eli handle that? Not in the state he's in. What are you trying to say? That I think I should be in charge. Oh, you do? I've got the most experience and the other fellas look up to me. Fine, you're acting sheriff. Really? Should I reconsider? No no. No. Thanks, Nucky. I know we've had our differences, but I want you to know that I'm here for you, now and in November. What does that mean? Have you thought about the future? It certainly sounds like you have. In regards to Eli, I mean. The election's right around the corner and he's hurt, weak, the reformers are alleging corruption. I mean you've seen the articles yourself, right? All I'm saying is that I'm at your service should you need. Jimmy : I was at the picture show. Van Alden : Which one? "Wagon tracks." What was the plot? Are you sure you want me to ruin the ending? We can do this all day, Mr. Darmody. It feels like we already have been. You're proposing that on the night of January 17, 1920, you were in a moving picture show from 7:00 P.M. until 11:30 P.M.? That's right. The running time of the film is only 78 minutes. I fell asleep. You have a child out of wedlock. Is his mother not fit to marry? That's none of your business. What's the name of the William s. Hart character in the movie? Buckskin? Buck-something. You're not sure? We're engaged. We're going to be married. Your aim at making her a respectable woman. ( Laughing ) How do you know Hans Schroeder? I don't know Hans Schroeder. Mrs. Schroeder? Margaret? I don't know these people. Lucy Danziger, she's a dancer at Ziegfeld follies. You know her? It's Nucky's girlfriend. Then what is the relationship between Mr. Thompson and Mrs. Schroeder? You want to know who Nucky Thompson is f*cking, why don't you ask him? ( Paper rustling ) This shipment of alcohol that Mr. Thompson sold to Arnold Rothstein, the shipment that was being transported the night of January 17th... "Wagon tracks." How do you know Al? I don't know any Al. From Chicago? You've got I all mixed up, officer. Did Mr. Thompson have Hans Schroeder murdered because he's in love with Schroeder's wife? The men in the woods... How many did you kill? I went to the movies. I fell asleep. I got up. I walked home. I went to bed. You wanna charge me, charge me. I've got nothing else to say. I thought you might find some satisfaction in living long enough to see your son grow into a man. You don't got anything on me. Don't I? ( Sniffs ) 
 
 Billy? Jimmy? Jesus Christ. They were gonna send me up the river, Jimmy. What did you say to them, Billy? f*cking rahway. What'd you tell them? Jimmy! Billy, what'd you say to... Jimmy! f*ck! Nucky : The old days, it was different. You could count on people to vote the party line. Now these democrats come along, make big promises. And you're concerned. Enough not to take anything for granted. I wish there was a way I could help. There is. You can help us get the women's vote. Shouldn't you wait until the amendment actually passes? I'm an eternal optimist. Speak to your friends, the temperance league, other women's organizations. I'm not much of an orator. I've seen you speak. You comport yourself very well. When was that? At my birthday with senator edge. Oh, that was merely banter. He's a United States senator and you wiped the floor with him. Seriously, would you be willing to speak on behalf of the party? I suppose so, but... But what? Do you not wish me to dress well? What do you mean? Do you not wish me to look attractive? Of course I do. I mean you are, whatever you're wearing. ( Knocking at door ) Eddie : Nucky, you have a call. All right. Madame Jeunet knows what suits me. She knows how to make me look pretty. She's the only one I trust. That's why you want her to stay in business? Why didn't you just say that in the first place? I didn't want you to know how selfish I was. I never hold that against anyone. Hello? Today? ( Door clanks, keys jingle ) Thank you. 10 minutes. Did you talk to Angela? She's aware of the situation. D'Alessios... They're being backed by Rothstein and Luciano. From the horse's mouth. Luciano spilled it to me before I was arrested. Can you bail me out? Five counts of murder... There is no bail. Would you get me a lawyer at least? For what? You know, to talk to, plan a strategy. It's a waste of money. Then, uh... Call my dad. Can't he help? Your dad? Are you that nervous? This kid, Billy Winslow... He's gonna testify, Nuck. So I've heard. So I'm staying here? Is that what you're saying? You said you were going to take care of this. I am. All I'm saying is the legal system's not your ticket to freedom. Uh, yes, I'm still on the line, operator. Thank you. Sir. Nelson, I was in a command meeting. What's the hubbub? We've arrested James Darmody, sir. What? When? Last night. He returned from Chicago. Did he talk? No, but he's aware we have his accomplice. Either way, the road leads to Thompson. Wonderful, Nelson. Terrific. It's a real shot in the arm for e bureau. Thank you for your confidence, sir. Keep up the good work. ( Sighs ) What did he say? He was pleased... very much so. Congratulations, sir. I didn't do it alone. I'm sorry about the telegram. That was very foolish of me. It was, but people make mistakes. A man needs to have the courage of his convictions. I knew we'd get Darmody eventually. You were right. Hmm. This witness, Billy Winslow... You think it's safe to keep him here? What'd you have in mind? Move him north pending trial? Federal jail in Manhattan maybe? Keep him out of Thompson's reach. ( Commodore coughing ) Jesus Christ, will you see a doctor already? Louanne : Stubborn as a mule. Shut up and get him a drink. Nucky : I'm fine, thank you. ( Coughing ) You look like sh1t. Well, your time comes, you just have to accept your situation. Are we talking about you or me? This Fletcher and these f*cking democrats. And your sheriff is out of commission now too? ( Chuckles ) It's not so easy, is it? Nice that you can still find joy. Five years in jail... Can you blame me? One of us had to go. You knew that. I had no choice. Neither did I. Which is why we made a deal, so let's put it to bed where it belongs. We're in trouble. ( Coughing ) Mayor Bacharach... He's weak and losing ground. ( Dog whines ) Even the f*cking dog is sick. ( Dog whimpers ) ( Coughs ) Well, what do you have on Fletcher? Nothing. He's clean. What does he want? He wants to be Mayor. ( Laughing ) f*cking boy scout. ( Sighs ) Well, replace him. What do you mean? Bacharach. Run somebody else for Mayor. People want change, give it to them. Or at least pretend to give it to them. What do I do about Eli? Replace him too. ( Coughing ) You son of a bitch. I'm dying. There's no time to be sentimental. I still can't decide. On you every dress is a joy to behold. They're all so plain. I'll need something special to wear to the inaugural... I think for now though just something to wear around town. Warren is sworn in. Oh, I do so love this. Mademoiselle's taste is excellent. How much is it? $480. I'll try the yellow one on again. You have rescued me. Merci beaucoup. The first day you came here, To myself I say, "this is a lady of taste and judgment." ( Speaks French ) You told me I smelled. Pardon? You said I needed to bathe more often. No. I was as useless as the Polish girl.. Until now. No no. My English... still sometimes I misspeak. I am grateful, Marguerite, very grateful. For your little one. Ivory... For her beautiful hair. My daughter didn't help you, madame Jeunet. I did. I just had to try it on. ( Laughs ) It is beautiful, isn't it? ( Inhales deeply ) Ah! Smell that air, the salt? I'd like to live by the ocean someday. I have a cousin, a rich kid... Ok, the rich kid took the grand tour, sailed all over world, but he puked the entire way. Seasickness. I gotta piss. You need to go? I'll stretch my legs. ( Engine stops ) ( Seagulls screeching ) Shouldn't have done that. Done what? Tried to plunge for my weapon. What are you talking about? You plunged at me, tried to commandeer my gun (hammer clicks ) That's why I killed you. ( Breathing deeply ) ( Rock thuds ) ( Engine starts ) ( Clicks ) - I spoke to my friend, the art dealer. He's not interested, unfortunately. But you seemed so optimistic. Well, he's staying in Europe. Did he say why? His response was in a wire. Surely with your husband home your financial burden has eased. You'll have other chances. When? I'll make some inquiries, but honestly... Your style is a rather cheap imitation of Mary Cassatt's. Sophie Tucker: I was in the woods with my boyfriend Ernie. He said to me, "it's dark out here. I wish had a lantern." 
I said, "me too. You've been munching on the grass for the past 10 minutes!" "Speaking of that," he said, "how come you never tell me when you reach a climax?" "Well, Ernie," I said, "it's because you're never around when it happens." Nucky : There's nothing wrong with being an opportunist. In fact, it's a trait I admire. The steel pier, the boulevard project... You were Johnny-on-the-spot with those. A good Christian, family man,  well-liked in the community. Very impressive. What are you looking for? The other shoe. Right now I'd like to sing a little number for you called "some of these days." ( Band playing ) Perhaps Mrs. Bader would like a better view. Have I told you how beautiful you look in that dress? It was a gift from madame Jeunet. ♪ Some of these days ♪ 
♪ you'll miss me, honey ♪ 
♪ some of these days ♪ * you're gonna be so lonely * ♪ you'll miss my hugging ♪ 
♪ you're gonna miss my kissing ♪ 
♪ you're gonna miss me, honey ♪ 
♪ when I'm far away... ♪ So I'm assuming you didn't ask me here to sing my praises. Of course not, Edward. I can't sing a note. How'd you like to be Mayor? With you as boss? I'd have more authority as street-sweeper. But a lot more time to run your construction business. It's time for a change, ed, and you're a solid republican. What about Bacharach? Mayor Bacharach is ill. He will not be seeking re-election. What's wrong with him? I'll make my diagnosis as soon as I have your answer. I have to discuss it with Kathryn. Be decisive, ed. Roads, hospitals, convention center... We can build great things together. Of course we'll have to add a ball field onto that list. 1920. The world belongs to the young. We'll let them think it does. Mayor Edward Bader. You roll that around on your tongue. I'll be in touch. * You've always had your way * * and when you leave me * * you know it's gonna grieve me * ♪ gonna miss your big fat mama ♪ 
♪ your mama, some of these days. ♪ Stand back, ladies and gentlemen, or face the wrath of Mombo... Hah! ...Tribal chieftain of the Zulu... ( Crowd gasps ) From the dark continent of Africa! Raised among lions and every bias fierce,  the Zulu have a thirst for human blood! Pity the poor souls unfortunate enough to spend the last of their days... We'll need to op by the ambassador. I told Jim Neary we meet him for a nightcap. It's rather late, isn't it? Man : Hiya, Nuck. Evening. Nucky? Nucky Thompson! Nein. ( Gunshot ) ( Screams ) ( Crowd screaming ) Eddie : You filthy b*st*rd! Come here! Come here! Stop stop! Man : Is that a cop? Get a cop! Woman : He went that way! Woman 2 : Call an ambulance! Eddie : Oh my God! Missus, are you all right? Man : Help! Man 2 : Is she dead? ( People screaming ) * you're gonna be so lonely * 
* you'll miss my hugging * 
* you're gonna miss my kissing * 
* you're gonna miss me, honey * 
* when I'm far away * 
* I feel so lonely *
