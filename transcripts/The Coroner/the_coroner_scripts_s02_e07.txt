 Happy?  
 Yeah. 
 Me too. 
 I've never felt this way about anyone. 
 I know we've not known each other that long, but I know that this feels right. 
 And I... This might sound crazy. 
 But what would you say to us moving in together? 
 (Dog barks) 
 It's not like you're getting any younger.  
 Give it a rest, Mum. 
 You got plans this weekend?  
 You trying to get shot of me? 
 I'm just saying - it's time you went to bed with something other than work.  
 Mum! 
 Well, last night, you feel asleep with the light on. Again. 
 With your glasses on. Again. 
 With work papers falling out of your hand. 
 Morning. 
 Oh, you tell her, Davey. She won't listen to her mother. 
 What, and you think she'd listen to me? 
 You're not here this early to gang up on me. 
 No. No, I wish. 
 A body's been found near Baillie's Causeway. 
 OK, give me five minutes. 
 Honestly, Davey. Tell her to give herself a shake. 
 Get a life. 
 I heard that. 
 No ID on him. 
 Pathologist reckons he's been there for several hours. 
 If you look at his clothes, they're wet. 
 It was raining last night, but they think it stopped about 1am, apparently. 
 So he's been here all night?  
 Yeah. 
 We think he lost control of the car, swerved off the road. 
 Probably drunk driving. 
 Got out and was hit by a passing vehicle. 
 Hit and run? 
 Looks that way. No CCTV this far out of town, though. 
 (Phone rings) 
 Excuse me. 
 Hello. ..Yeah, go on, let's have it. 
 ..All right, OK. Good work. 
 We've got an ID from the registration number. 
 Jason Daniels. 
 "JD is king". 
 Poor old JD. 
 Are you sure this is all right, Mrs Daniels? He has sustained some serious facial injuries. 
 I need to see him. 
 Is this your husband, Jason Daniels? 
 (She laughs) 
 No. No, no, it's not him. 
 It's the shock. 
 Sorry. Sorry, I, er... 
 It's fine. Take as long as you need. 
 Do you know who this man is? 
 No. No, can you cover him up? 
 Are you sure? 
 Yes, quite sure. Can you cover him up now, please? 
 I'm very sorry. Is there anything I can do? 
 No. I... I need to go. 
 I-I want to talk to my husband. 
 So do we. 
 Davey... 
 Yes. Sorry, Mrs Daniels. If you'd like to follow me out.  
 Thank you. 
 I knew I'd find you in here. 
 Yeah. I'll be there in a minute. 
 Whoa. 
 Have you seen this? 
 What? 
 Well, I've heard of blowing your own trumpet, but even still. 
 Seriously, Clint, can you show some respect? 
 No, look. 
 "Paradise awaits". 
 OK. We're back to square one. 
 So I'm going to need you to get me everything you can on Jason Daniels. 
 Where he went to school, how he made his money. 
 Did he owe money? Did he have a driver? 
 Anything. OK? 
 Have the forensic guys finished? 
 Yeah, all secured, Sarge. 
 All right. 
 We've traced it to a Fred Clegg. 
 And we found "Dad" in his list of contacts so his folks are on the way in now. 
 Can you do me a favour? 
 Can you speak to them for me, please? 
 Yes, of course. 
 Thanks. I've got Jason Daniels coming in for interview. 
 Who is this "A" person? 
 "CAN'T W8 2 C U AGAIN". 
 Well, it's his girlfriend, by the looks of it. 
 What makes you so sure it's a woman? 
 Judging by the picture she sent. 
 (Phone beeps) 
 Oh, yeah, that would clinch it. 
 Yeah, it would, wouldn't it? And there's the text messages. 
 "Can't stop thinking about you." 
 "Can't wait to see you again." Really lovey-dovey. 
 Up until last night and then it's... 
 "Sorry about what I said." "I didn't mean to push you away." 
 "Please can we go back to the way we were?" 
 She's got it bad, hasn't she? 
 Have you spoken to her? 
 No, not yet. 
 I want to get a positive ID from his parents first. 
 KNOCK ON DOOR Yeah? 
 Jason Daniels. 
 Ah, right. Thank you. Mr Daniels. DS Higgins. 
 My colleague, Jane Kennedy, the coroner. 
 Pleased to meet you. I'll leave you to it. 
 Yeah. Have a seat. 
 Right. I won't beat around the bush. 
 Do you know this man? 
 Is that the guy that stole my car? 
 Are you saying your car was stolen? 
 While I was away, obviously. Is there any damage? 
 No. It's just a slight bump. 
 That's a relief. When can I get it back? 
 A day or two, I should think. 
 So, the man in the photo. You don't know him, no? 
 No. 
 Right, OK. 
 Look, I'm very sorry about the mix-up this morning. 
 Your wife tried to call you. So did we. 
 But we just got the answerphone. 
 Have you any idea what you put her through this morning? 
 Ah, well, like I said, I'm very sorry. 
 We just have to go with the information that's in front of us. 
 Yeah, I appreciate that, Sergeant. 
 So I won't be taking it any further - for the moment. 
 Terrible business. 
 He might've been a thief, but to leave him at the side of the road, like a dog... 
 If there's anything I can do to help with your enquiries? 
 Ah, yeah, actually. It would be handy to get your fingerprints. 
 Just for the purposes of elimination. 
 Should take about ten minutes. 
 Of course. 
 And if you need anything else, you can get me in the office. 
 Ah, right. OK, great, thanks. 
 OK, I'll show you the way. 
 I'll let you know as soon as we have any information. 
 Take care. 
 Thanks, Sheila. 
 Hey. 
 That his folks? 
 Yes. We've got a positive ID. 
 Everyone knew him as Fred, but to his mum, he was always Freddy. 
 PM results. 
 Right, shall we? 
 "Examination of the scalp shows evidence of bruising. 
 "Scalp lacerations with comminuted, depressed skull fractures. 
 "Extradural and subdural bleeding..." 
 I can read, Davey. 
 "Not compatible with a pedestrian road traffic collision." 
 We've got blood where his head was banged on the door. 
 There are two sets of prints all over the car. 
 But there's a third set on the driver's side door handle there, and on the seat there. 
 And if you come round here... 
 ..we've got some scratches there. Traces of black paint. 
 So...? 
 We think he was run off the road, dragged from the car, beaten up. 
 And left for dead. 
 Yeah, well, we know that he lay there for several hours. 
 So, it's either a murder or a serious assault gone wrong. 
 Or it wasn't meant for him? 
 Yeah. Well... 
 ..that number plate does rather scream, "Here I am. 
 "Come and get me," doesn't it? 
 So... Fred steals a car for whatever reason. 
 Takes a hit for Jason Daniels. 
 Yeah. Either way, a serious crime. 
 So, what's next? 
 Well, I'm going to go to Fred Clegg's flat. 
 Then I've gotta see this "A" woman. 
 Give her the bad news. 
 OK. I'll see you later, then. 
 Hang on. 
 What?  
 Well, are you busy just now? 
 Why? 
 Oh, come on. You know this is the bit I hate. 
 Breaking bad news? Or asking me for help? 
 Both. You're much better at it than I am. 
 Is that a please?  
 Is that a yes? 
 Yes, go on, then. 
 Oh, wow! "J Daniels Developments"? 
 Yeah, he's converting an old church into 40 new harbourside flats. 
 And he owns a nightclub, too. 
 The Lighthouse, you know it? 
 No. 
 He's Mr Big Shot, you know. A player. 
 I don't know any Fred Clegg. What's this about? 
 Do you know this man? 
 That's Jeremy. 
 Jeremy? 
 Jeremy Dutton. Why do you want to know? 
 No... He can't be. No! 
 What's going on?  
 Oh, Steve! 
 Hey, it's all right. 
 Jeremy. He's dead! 
 What? Dead? 
 Oh, yeah, sorry. DS Higgins, South Dart Police. 
 This is my colleague, Jane Kennedy. She's the coroner. 
 You're? 
 Steve Johnson. 
 My ex. 
 Look, I understand this is very difficult, but we really need you to tell us everything you know about, er, Jeremy? 
 He was an airline pilot. 
 Er, no, actually. He was a window cleaner. 
 What? 
 And his name wasn't Jeremy. It was Fred. Fred Clegg. 
 How did you meet him? 
 On a dating site - Perfect Pair. 
 Look, there must be some mistake. 
 He was loaded. That car of his, I mean, the starting price is 70 grand. 
 Well, we have reason to believe that he stole it. 
 When? 
 Last night. 
 No, you're wrong. It's his car. 
 He's always got it. 
 He can't be a window cleaner. He can't be. 
 Can you think of anyone who would want to hurt him? 
 Look, she hardly knew the guy. 
 Excuse me, but how did you hurt your hand? 
 Comes with the job. I'm a bouncer. 
 Where? 
 Pubs, mostly. 
 I can't believe he's dead. 
 Look, she's upset. You better leave. 
 Yeah, sorry. 
 Yeah, but you were one of the last people to see him alive. 
 So we will want to talk to you again. All right. 
 We'll be in touch. 
 Wow.  
 Ooh. Classy. 
 Yeah, looks like he's going for the old sexy bachelor pad vibe. 
 What? 
 I don't think anyone says "pad" any more. 
 Don't they? 
 No! 
 Come and have a look at this! 
 This room looks like it's seen some action. 
 Or don't we say "action" anymore?  
 How would I know? 
 He's certainly got a one-track mind.  
 Yeah. 
 Looks like he broke the bed. 
 What are you doing? 
 (Phone rings) 
 Hello, Yes? 
 ..No, it's all right, go on. 
 Really? 
 ..No, OK, good. Good work. OK, bye. 
 Bye. 
 We've got it. The connection between Fred Clegg and Jason Daniels. 
 Sergeant. 
 I asked you specifically to come and see me in the office. 
 Surely this can wait till tomorrow? 
 I'm afraid it can't, no. 
 I'm sorry about this, darling. 
 OK, I'm back. Where were we? 
 Sorry, Mrs Daniels, could you stay? 
 You need to hear this. 
 I'll call you back in ten minutes. 
 We now know that Fred Clegg's death wasn't caused by a hit and run, but by a vicious attack. 
 That's awful. 
 Yeah. 
 But what we don't know is if that attack was meant for him or for you. 
 What? 
 So, can you think of anyone who might want to harm you? 
 Well, you don't get to be this successful without making a few enemies. 
 What do you mean "enemies"? 
 You know, business rivals, resentful losers, that kind of thing. 
 Look, if the attack was meant for you, then you might still be at risk. 
 That's what you've come to say, isn't it? 
 So you need to be extra careful. Promise me. 
 (Phone rings) 
 I'm sorry, I really need to take this. 
 She's a very busy woman, my wife. 
 She's a fund manager, you know. One of the best. 
 Er, could you do me a favour? 
 Would you mind looking at this photo again, please? 
 Actually. I wonder... Could be the window cleaner at my offices. Is it? 
 It is. Yes.  
 That's it. 
 He cleaned the windows inside and out. 
 Actually, he's been in my office. 
 He could've taken my car keys, stolen my car. 
 Well, that car was used on several occasions. 
 Are you saying he stole it repeatedly? 
 He must've done.  
 I find that hard to believe. 
 I know. It's outrageous. 
 But now I come to think of it, I lost a set of car keys a few months ago. 
 He must've nicked them and taken the car whenever he liked. 
 You must have a high level of security there, though. 
 Yes, but I'm out and about all day and I'm often away on business. 
 I leave it all over the place. 
 I find that very hard to believe. 
 It's just a car. I'm not precious about it. 
 "It's just a car. I'm not precious about it." 
 I mean, how crass is that? 
 I don't think his wife would disagree with you. 
 What do you mean?  
 You didn't see the way she looked at him? 
 No, but I saw her reaction when she saw the body. 
 She was pretty shaken. 
 Could be because it wasn't him. 
 I think she's worth checking out. 
 Oh, right, so you think she's hired a hitman and he's got the wrong guy because of the stolen car. 
 Pretty rubbish hitman. 
 I've got a feeling about her. 
 Wrong tree, love. 
 Hey! What do you think you're doing? 
 I believe this is your car? 
 What if it is? 
 How did you get that dent on the side? 
 Some woman ran into me. Why? 
 What's this about? 
 Where were you on Sunday night? 
 Last Sunday? At my mum's. 
 Putting up her curtains. 
 Oh, that's nice. Till when? 
 Early hours. Four. Five. 
 She fed me that much I fell asleep on her couch, didn't I? 
 Do you know this guy? 
 No. Should I? 
 His name's Jason Daniels. Ring any bells? 
 Never heard of him. 
 How about you, love? 
 Sorry. 
 There's no need to be sorry. 
 I just want to eliminate you from our enquiries. 
 Actually, would you mind coming down to the station so I can take your fingerprints? 
 Are you charging me?  
 No. 
 So I'll pass. 
 Come on, let's go. 
 I will need to take a statement from you, though, love. 
 So probably best that you come down to the station. 
 On your own. 
 Oh, good. 
 Oh, back off, Mum. It's for work. 
 I'm looking for someone specific. 
 How are you meant to find someone on this, anyway? 
 Well, you gotta register. Put in your e-mail address. 
 Uh, no way.  
 Well, use mine. Budge over. 
 Right... 
 We're in. 
 What's his age? 
 36.  
 35 to 37. 
 Do you want his name? 
 People don't use their names. Only usernames. 
 Have you never used a dating site before?  
 No. 
 Seriously?  
 Seriously. 
 Seriously?  
 Seriously. 
 Distance? 
 Er...five miles. 
 Here we go No. 
 There's more. 
 That's him. 
 
 
 
 (Door opens) 
 Only me. 
 All right, my lover. 
 What's all this nonsense? 
 Er, nothing. 
 Oh, you're not thinking of buying a flat from this fly-boy, are ya? 
 I mean, yeah, it's time you had your own place. 
 Bit embarrassing living at home with your mum at your age. 
 You know Jason Daniels?  
 Oh, yeah. 
 Wide-boy. It's all dirty tricks and dodgy deals with him. 
 You say that about every successful businessman. 
 No, I don't. Anyway, I've had dealings with this little runt. 
 Oh, yeah?  
 Yeah. Tried to do me out of the Black Dog. 
 Oh, yes. I remember that. 
 Yeah. Offers to buy me out for a ridiculously low price. 
 I refuse. Next thing, there's bother. Fights every night. 
 Break-ins. Place getting trashed. 
 Couldn't prove anything, of course.  
 It was terrible. 
 But you didn't sell, obviously. 
 No. I just threatened to tell his wife. 
 How would you know his wife? 
 Oh, it's not hard to find out about her. 
 Real high-flyer. Stocks and shares and all that kind of stuff. 
 Look her up. 
 Yeah, I don't think she'd like to find out how much of a low-life he really is. 
 Tidy little wife she is, too. 
 Not as tidy as you, my love. Not even close. 
 Well, there's Davey's car. 
 Yeah, and here he is.  
 All right, Davey! 
 What are you doing here? What are you hoping to find? 
 Anything to give us a handle on Fred Clegg. You? 
 Speaking to the neighbours. Killing time, really. 
 Till I can nail Steve Johnson.  
 Really? 
 Who's Steve Johnson? 
 Er, Adele Lesley's ex. 
 I got a bad feeling about that guy from the word go. 
 I've seen enough domestic violence in my time. 
 You think he hits her? 
 Well, maybe not yet. But he's got it in him. 
 He did it, Jane. 
 He's got a flimsy alibi, he's got a motive. 
 He refused to co-operate with the police. 
 He's got a black car, it's got a dent in it. 
 I just gotta get forensics to put that car at the crime scene, game over. 
 Whoa, hold on. Keys to Fred Clegg's flat? 
 Well, I suppose I can't stop you, but you're wasting your time. 
 It's in the bag. 
 You know, Davey's too confident. 
 We're missing something with Fred Clegg. 
 I mean, money under the bed, false ID. 
 Who are you? 
 Stay back! 
 All right.  
 Back!  
 All right. All right. 
 Let me go.  
 Keep calm. Let it go. Let it go. 
 You go, I'll get Davey. 
 OK. 
 Enough! Enough! 
 Calm down! 
 It was a one-night stand, all right? 
 But I couldn't find my bracelet. 
 Didn't have his number. 
 Then I read in the paper the guy's dead, recognised the name. 
 Hit and run, it said. 
 So, I'm thinking better take matters into your own hands, Jinty, my girl. 
 Once the family swoop in, you'll never see that bracelet again. 
 So you broke in? 
 No. I told you. 
 That lock was broke when I got there. 
 Why didn't you call the police? 
 Respect for the guy's memory. Fred, that's right. Fred's memory. 
 Didn't want the fuzz digging into his s*x life and that. 
 Really. Is that the best you can do? 
 It's the truth. 
 Well, you may have had a one-night stand. 
 And you may have thought the guy had a bit of money stashed away. 
 And you may have read he was dead, so you saw your opportunity and you broke in. 
 I never. How many times?  
 Well, you didn't report a break-in to the police, did you? 
 Two witnesses saw you ransacking the place. 
 And I know you've got a criminal record. 
 Joyriding. Shoplifting. 
 So, I may just charge you with burglary with intent. 
 No way.  
 Come on, Jinty. Sit down. 
 I think you can help us. 
 How? 
 Tell us about Fred Clegg. 
 Did you meet him on a dating site? 
 No way. Creeps and losers, that's all you find on there. 
 Great! My mum keeps trying to get me to join one. 
 Your mum?  
 Yeah, I know. 
 Look, Jinty, Fred Clegg was killed in suspicious circumstances, so anything you can tell us, you know, that would help us. 
 Anything, anything at all. 
 He liked it rough. The rougher the better. 
 I mean rough. 
 Slapping, hitting, shoving, slamming you right up the... 
 Yeah, all right. I get the idea. 
 I knew s*x was important to him when I saw that tattoo. 
 What tattoo? 
 Fred Clegg? Can you describe him to me? 
 About five ten. Dark hair. 
 Blue eyes. Smooth skin. No tattoos. 
 Remind you of anyone? 
 Now, we can test Fred Clegg's sheets for your DNA or we can do this the easy way. 
 All right, I'll tell you. 
 Then you can back off. 
 Go on. 
 I love my wife. I really do. 
 I adore her. 
 But, well, she's a workaholic. 
 She never switches off and when she does, she's just too tired. 
 Anyway, in my position, women throw themselves at me all the time. I've fallen for it before. Gold-diggers. 
 The type that want Anna to find out so they can get their hooks in. 
 I've nearly lost her because of them. 
 So? 
 Then I hooked up with Fred. 
 Turns out we're from the same council estate. 
 Fancy that. 
 Fred was footloose and fancy-free, but no money. 
 And I had all this dosh and nothing to do with it. 
 So you swapped lives? 
 It's liberating, getting to be someone else. 
 Fred got to pull all the up-market birds and I got to have some fun with no strings. 
 It was an arrangement, that's all. A bit of harmless fun. 
 I love my wife. I adore her. 
 So you said. 
 I've never heard anything like it. 
 Me neither. It's gross. 
 He claims to love his wife. 
 So why go to those lengths to cheat? 
 Marriage? The eternal mystery. 
 Who knows what makes people stick it out. 
 The hold one person has over another. 
 (Phone rings) 
 Hello. ..Yeah, go on, yeah. 
 Oh, really? 
 You're sure? 
 All right, thanks. 
 Steve Johnson's car. Tyre tread doesn't match the crime scene. 
 Doesn't mean he didn't do it, though. 
 It just means he didn't use his own car. 
 What? 
 You're fixating on him. You need to look away. 
 Check out Anna Daniels. 
 Maybe she found out about this sordid little deal with Fred Clegg. 
 Well, well. 
 That's interesting. 
 Hello, there, could you put me through to the planning department, please? ..Thank you. 
 What? You got beat up by a girl? 
 Come on. It's not funny.  
 No, it's not. She was like a wildcat. 
 Yeah, she was totally out of control. If Jane hadn't pulled her off...  
 You mean Jane saved you? 
 Stop it. Pack it in, the pair of you. 
 Have you got a second? 
 Jason Daniels' business is in serious trouble. 
 Really?  
 Yeah. You know the 40 new harbour flat conversions? 
 Well, he's pressed ahead without the right planning permission. 
 So he's got to rip out the staircases, replace the roof. 
 Pay back the deposits. And he's got a cash-flow problem. 
 And, for the record, I take no pleasure in that whatsoever. 
 What about his wife? 
 Yeah, I did some digging on her as well.  
 Ways and Means Act? 
 Something like that, yep. She is hugely successful. 
 Works 24/7 and he plays the field. 
 No wonder she'd want to get rid of him. 
 If he was my husband, I would've done him in by now. 
 Yeah, I don't think she's got the head space to plan a murder. 
 I think you're missing something. I'm going to see her tomorrow. 
 See if I can get something out of her. 
 I doubt it. 
 (Phone rings) 
 Hello, Beth. ..No, your mum's just looking for her phone. 
 Yeah, OK, I'll tell her. 
 All right, but I want you back by ten. 
 OK. Bye-bye. 
 Beth - she's going to her friend Daisy's house tonight to study. 
 PHONE CHIMES Oh, you've got a message. 
 Give me my phone. 
 Leo?  
 What? 
 Perfect Pair. 
 Give me that! Davey! 
 Well, hello, Leo. 
 Ooh, he's muscly! 
 No. No, no, no. 
 I'm not apologising.  
 "Best feature - long legs." 
 Mum, how could you? 
 I did it for you. To help you meet someone. 
 I don't want to meet someone. 
 Well, 34 men want to meet you. And look at all these winks. 
 "So, guys, I'm waiting to hear from you. 
 "But don't worry, I won't bite - unless you ask me nicely." 
 It's good, isn't it? 
 I want this wiped before Beth sees it. 
 Beth's not here. 
 It's not the point. Just get me off it! 
 Ooh, he's nice. 
 Can I leave that with you? OK, bye. 
 Bye. 
 Sorry, I appreciate you're busy, I just wondered if you could spare ten minutes.  
 Five. 
 Right, the thing is, we think the attack still might have been meant for your husband. 
 Are you sure you can't think of anyone who would want to hurt him? 
 No, I can't think of anyone. 
 Can I ask how things are between you? 
 I'm sorry? 
 You are two very busy people, with two separate, high-powered businesses to run. 
 It can put a strain on a marriage. 
 What are you getting at? 
 Do you know something about my husband? 
 I'm sorry, I can't reveal the source. 
 But it has come to light that... 
 ..J Daniels Developments is in serious trouble. 
 Well, yes. That much I do know. 
 You do? 
 Yes, a planning screw-up or some such. Cash-flow problems. 
 Anyway, I can lend him the money until it all comes good. 
 Is there anything else? 
 Are you happy? 
 I beg your pardon? 
 I just asked if you're happy? 
 Well, of course I am. I love my work. 
 Hi, there.  
 What do you want? 
 Is she in? Your boss? 
 No. You can leave a message. 
 I'll just wait. 
 Well, if you'll excuse me, I really need to get on. 
 Your poor face. Did I do that? 
 I'm really very busy. 
 I'd say I'm sorry, but I'm not. 
 You felt it, too, didn't you? 
 I think you should go and come back... 
 Oh, come on. Remember what it was like? 
 On the ground? Me on top of you? 
 That spark? 
 Imagine we'd kept going. What would that have been like? 
 Ow, don't... 
 Everything all right? 
 Jane, hi. There's someone, someone here to see you. 
 I'll get you a coffee. 
 How can I help? 
 That guy. The one that I thought was Fred. 
 How do I get in touch? 
 I'm afraid I can't tell you. 
 Well, can you do me a favour, then? 
 Give him this from me. 
 Gonorrhoea. 
 Tell him I'm sorry. 
 This is from Jinty Morgan. 
 You came all the way over here to give me this? 
 How thoughtful to go to all that trouble. 
 I'm investigating a man's death. Nothing is too much trouble. 
 I appreciate that, but this is my personal life. 
 If my wife finds out about it, it would finish us. 
 You're not going to tell her, are you? 
 Please, I'm begging you. She's everything to me. 
 I'm nothing without her. 
 She's out. You are? 
 Jason Daniels. 
 Ah. 
 I take it you've heard all about me? 
 What a bad boy I've been? 
 Yes, well... 
 I'm sorry. You're embarrassed. 
 But you know what, so am I. 
 Anyway, the coroner won't be back till later, so... 
 She despises me, doesn't she? 
 No. 
 Why wouldn't she? I've not exactly been co-operative. 
 That's why I'm here. To apologise. 
 How do you think she'll take it? 
 She's quite a scary lady, your boss. 
 Yeah, she can be. Sometimes. 
 You OK? 
 Guts playing up. All this stress. 
 (He coughs) 
 Must've gone down the wrong way. Sorry. 
 Do you want me to get you something? Some water? 
 Please. 
 Look at that car! 
 Jinty? Remember me? 
 What do you want? 
 Get in. 
 Hey.  
 Hey.  
 Guess what? 
 What?  
 We've found the car that ran Fred Clegg off the road. 
 Where?  
 80 miles away. Stolen vehicle. 
 And the prints match those on the Porsche. 
 Did you speak to Anna Daniels? 
 Yes, but I think you're right. 
 I don't think it was her. 
 I need to sit down. You think I'm right? 
 Yeah, she didn't know about the other woman. 
 She is spectacularly single-minded. I mean, no personal life. 
 Work-focused. Totally driven. 
 Sad, really. 
 Oh, and I paid Jason Daniels a visit. 
 Why? 
 Jinty Morgan's asked me to give him a card from the Berkeley Clinic. 
 Oh, I'd have done that for you gladly. 
 Jinty. 
 Can I help you? 
 I just want a quick word.  
 Sure, come up. 
 No, you're all right. It won't take long. 
 What I told you... About the gonorrhoea. 
 Thing is, I made it up. 
 Sorry? 
 I just wanted to get back at the guy. 
 For lying to me. You know, give him a fright. 
 But I feel a bit bad about it now so I reckon I should let him off the hook. 
 He got to you, didn't he? 
 I don't know what you mean. 
 How could he? He doesn't know where I live. 
 He doesn't even know my name. 
 He was here to see you. To apologise. 
 And you believed him? You idiot. He was here for one thing only. 
 Jinty Morgan's address. 
 It's not your fault. You've been played by an expert. 
 Goodnight, Guv.  
 Yeah, night, John. 
 See you tomorrow. 
 (Phone rings) 
 Sorry, love, I didn't realise the time. 
 Yeah, still at my desk. 
 Not getting very far, though, so I'll probably head home soon. 
 All right. See you shortly. 
 (Phone rings) 
 Hello, yes? 
 Really? When? 
 OK, cheers. 
 (Knock on door) 
 Davey?  
 Do you fancy going clubbing tonight? 
 Did my mum put you up to this?  
 What? No. 
 I do not need to "go out and enjoy myself." I do not need to "get a life". 
 All right, calm down. 
 Steve Johnson's been spotted going into Jason Daniels's nightclub.  
 What? 
 Yeah, I put a tail on him. Looks like it paid off. 
 I wouldn't get too excited. He could just be going clubbing. 
 Well, we've got nothing else to go on, have we? May as well check it out. 
 Or have you got something more exciting to do? 
 20 minutes? 
 20 minutes. 
 All right, just try and blend in. 
 Good night, guys. 
 Hi, there, I think we're on the guest list? Mr and Mrs Higgins? 
 Yes, they're fine. 
 Thanks.  
 Cheers, mate. 
 Like a drink? 
 Um, I'm with someone. 
 There's not enough fire exits in this place. 
 Don't leave me on my own again. 
 And those girls are underage. 
 Just ignore it. 
 Look at that. 
 If that deal goes down, I'm hauling them in. 
 Here, look, here he is, Steve Johnson. 
 He works here?! 
 Right, I'm hauling him in, anyway. 
 All right, you leave this one to me. 
 You let me do the talking. 
 No, Stevie. No, no! 
 What did I tell you!  
 No! Please! 
 BANGING ON DOOR Police! Open the door! Police! 
 Adele! 
 It's all right. It's all right. 
 Ambulance, please. 
 All right! You're under arrest for assault and GBH with intent. 
 I want those results as soon as. You got that. 
 Top priority. 
 I just gave him a kicking. I didn't kill him. 
 As good as. Because he wound up dead. 
 I didn't mean to. I swear. 
 I was doing it for her. For Adele. 
 To get her back. 
 So you could use her as a punchbag? 
 She should be with me. 
 Well, right now, she's in A&E getting her face stitched and her bones set. 
 I never meant to hurt her. I love her. 
 She's everything to me. I'm nothing without her. 
 I don't know what you're talking about. 
 Yes, you do. Steve Johnson. 
 He works as a bouncer in your nightclub. 
 You have any idea how many people work for me? 
 He's just been arrested for killing Fred Clegg. 
 Good for you. You got your man. 
 You can go now. 
 Any time you like. 
 You put him up to it. 
 Fred Clegg knew he was on to a good thing. 
 But he wanted more. So he threatened to tell your wife. 
 You paid him off but he wouldn't go away. 
 When you found the connection with Steve Johnson, that must have been the answer to your prayers. 
 All you had to do was work him from the back.  
 Oh, please. 
 Like you did Jinty. And my assistant. 
 You dripped poison into Steve Johnson's ear. 
 Then you sat back and let him deal with Fred Clegg for you. 
 And what if I did? I've committed no crime. 
 You can't touch me, and you know it. 
 (Inaudible conversation) 
 Davey? 
 Oh, cheers, Judith.  
 What happened? 
 Oh, that, it's just a guy resisting arrest. 
 We got him, though. Nasty bit of work. Killer. 
 Good on you. 
 On the house. Action man. 
 Cheers. 
 Oh, thanks. 
 What kept you? 
 Just a loose end. 
 (Whirring)
