 Who the hell are you calling? 
 Home. 
 Not on my phone. 
 You'll get us killed. 
 Hello? 
 [gunshot] 
 I can get you into SOC's mainframe, but you're not going to find anything good there. 
 They use data centers now. 
 You know where SOC's data center is? 
 For the right price, I do. 
 Somebody there? 
 Bob : You wanted me to find out about that cleric Yusuf Qasim. 
 Harrison : That's him. 
 What do you say to a terrorist? 
 Where'd he go? 
 Hey. 
 Who are you? What do you want? 
 [Luc breathing heavily] 
 She's dead? 
 Four men, American military, looking for you, trying to kill you. 
 Why? Why? 
 I'm sorry. I don't... 
 Give it to me. Give it to me. 
 I'll find out myself. 
 What? 
 The jump drive... give it to me! 
 Give it to me now. 
 That's not going to happen! 
 [cell phone dialing] 
 What are you doing? 
 I'm calling home just like you did. 
 Who knows? Maybe this time someone will answer. 
 Your husband maybe. 
 [line trilling] 
 No, you don't want to do this. 
 [trilling stops, line clicking] 
 Guess not. 
 Time to die. 
 My name is Harrison Walters. 
 You're following me. Why? 
 We're not... following you. 
 We just have some questions. 
 Questions? 
 For me? Why? 
 Because you are Yusuf Qasim, and you're supposed to be dead. 
 You are mistaken. 
 My name is Sunil Chhetri. 
 I am an auto mechanic. 
 Must be a dangerous job. 
 You have the wrong man. 
 Listen, you knew my dad. 
 He was writing a story about Black Sands. 
 You were his source. 
 Tell me your name again. 
 I'm Harrison Walters. 
 My dad was Randall Walters. 
 I read about him in the paper. I'm sorry for your loss. 
 The papers got it wrong. It wasn't an affair. 
 It was about Odelle Ballard. 
 My dad and I were working on a story about her, and we got too close, so they killed him. 
 I need to know why. 
 I don't like it. 
 He's nervous, jumpy. 
 You sure you don't want to give Rhys your access code so he can stop being nervous about you being nervous... and stay out of the building, keep clean? 
 I can't trust him with that. 
 No offense. 
 None taken. 
 Damn. 
 Yeah, wait till you see it from the inside... wall-to-wall servers, literally hundreds of them. 
 How do we find the right one? 
 Ours will be center-punched, in the middle... clear, clean, and off line. 
 What the hell? 
 Jenji : Yes, they have security. 
 A patrol pattern... makes a loop every 18 minutes. 
 Gives us 17 minutes to freeze the video, get in and out. 
 Freeze time... piece of cake. 
 I don't remember you telling me about security guards, as in actual people. 
 They'll never even know we were here. 
 Come on. 
 [beeping] 
 Ah... there she is. 
 [beeps] 
 Okay, you're up, big shot. 
 [keys clacking] 
 I thought you said you froze them. 
 Must be on a separate system. 
 They weren't supposed to have separate systems. 
 What do we do? 
 I'll take care of it. 
 We... we need to leave. 
 Too late. Already on tape, my nervous friend. 
 Relax. They'll only check the tape if they think someone's been here, and they'll only think someone's been here if they find out someone screwed with the system, but they're not gonna find that out, because I'm good. 
 Now stop screwing around and finish with the damn access code. 
 [keys clacking] 
 [laughing] 
 They've already seen you... Ugh. Moron. 
 What the hell did you just do? 
 I took care of it. 
 What happened to "they'll never know we were here"? 
 Our faces are on that camera. Hey, hey, can you erase... 
 Can you get Al Capone out of here? 
 I can't concentrate. 
 Go to the woods. 
 We'll meet you there in five. 
 You said this was gonna be clean... in and out. 
 No problems. 
 Go. 
 Go. 
 Hello, Mr. Decker. 
 [cell phone dialing] 
 Yes, he is. 
 They're inside. 
 After that, you want me to kill them? 
 Harrison : Why are you labeled the Jack of Spades? 
 And what does it all have to do with Odelle Ballard? 
 Look, I know you're interested in her. 
 You were at her funeral. 
 So, if you can tell me, maybe I can find out why they killed my father. 
 He's a soccer player, isn't he? 
 Sunil Chhetri... he plays for Nepal, right? 
 How'd you know that? 
 I love soccer. 
 Come on, you know that. 
 Your father was a good man. 
 He was trying to do the right thing. 
 But, no... 
 I will not help you. 
 I have my life now. 
 It is a simple one. 
 My friends gave me this job, a simple place to live. 
 How did you find me? 
 A picture from Odelle's funeral. 
 [scoffs] So stupid... 
 I should have never gone. 
 Why did you? 
 Yeah, I used some facial-recognition software I got off Amazon. 
 You weren't that hard to find. 
 I mean, that is, if somebody's looking for you. 
 So you were the one who found me? 
 Yep. And it wasn't that hard. 
 Of course, I could make you disappear too... wipe out that photo, any trace of it, just like that, boom, gone. 
 That is, if you help us. 
 Okay... one name. 
 I will give you one name. That is all. 
 But then I will never see you again. 
 Is that understood? 
 Depends on the name. 
 Absolutely. 
 Thomas Darnell. 
 Who's Thomas Darnell? 
 Diallo, my sweet? Are my messages not clear? 
 I'm in danger. I'm afraid. 
 I need to hear from you, please. 
 Are you still mad at me? 
 What is this? 
 [sighs] 
 We've waited long enough. It's not safe. 
 You should come with us. 
 But your reporter from the  New York Times   is coming. 
 The reporter will come. She'll see that we're not here. 
 She'll meet us in Paris. 
 Or... 
 I can tell the reporter myself, tell her all about you. 
 And we can make a tape. 
 You can tell her directly... a tape she can take with her. 
 No one will be able to doubt that. 
 We'll make it like the terrorists... with today's newspaper. 
 Okay, I really think you should come with us. 
 I'm not afraid. I'm a celebrity. 
 And my lover is my general. He will protect me. 
 Now, if you'll excuse   moi... 
 Where's your friend? 
 What friend? 
 Don't screw with me. 
 Give me the jump drive now... right now. 
 Once more... where's your friend? 
 [cell phone beeps] 
 [cell phone beeps] 
 [hammer thudding] 
 Peter : Stop. 
 Stop. 
 Jenji, stop it! Stop it! 
 You will never... ever see me again. 
 Have a nice life. 
 My name's Sergeant Odelle Ballard, serial number 913840090. 
 As you can see by the date, this is... 
 Well, it's now. 
 And contrary to what you may have heard, I am very much alive. 
 Unfortunately, the rest of my unit is not, having been killed by a drone. 
 Since then, I have been pursued by Osela, killing many in their path as they hunt and try to kill me. 
 And it's all because of what's on this. 
 See, this is proof of millions of dollars of payments from a company called SOC to various terrorist groups, including Al-Qaeda. 
 For what purpose, I don't know. 
 But I'm going to get this to you in your office in Paris somehow. 
 Now, if you could... show this to my family... um... [clears throat] 
 Ron... 
 Suzanne... 
 I know you... 
 Come on. [chuckles] 
 I know that you thought I was dead. 
 Um, you even went to my funeral, and that must have been so horrible for you. 
 I'm sorry. I'm so sorry for that pain. 
 But I am alive, and I will continue to stay alive, and I will get home to you somehow. 
 I promise. 
 And I love you very much. 
 Maya : He's in the hospital, Mom, the hospital. 
 School can wait. 
 Sarah : I know. It's horrible. 
 Maya, you can't just leave... Peter! 
 Maya : I'm not a child anymore. You can't tell me what to do! 
 Excuse me! You come back here! 
 He's in the hospital! 
 I'm sorry he's in the hospital... 
 Dad, Cameron was attacked last night in his own apartment. 
 He's in the hospital. 
 She's out of control. 
 Sorry, kiddo. I'm with your mom on this. 
 School comes first. 
 You don't even care that he was attacked? 
 I hate you both. 
 Thank you. 
 You okay? 
 Suzanne, breakfast. 
 [footsteps approaching] 
 What are you doing? 
 Nothing. Made you cinnamon rolls. 
 What's wrong? 
 Oh, it's just Lucy. 
 You know, her fiancé was in Mom's unit? 
 She's coming over for lunch today. 
 Do I have to come? 
 Of course not. Only if you want to. 
 Good. I don't. 
 Flight's on time. 
 You sure she's coming? 
 It's the   New York Times. 
 They won't miss an opportunity like this. 
 [cell phone rings] 
 It's Ballard. She made another call home. 
 We got her coordinates. What do you think? 
 No. 
 This time we wait. 
 She'll lead us to her. 
 Perhaps I'm not being clear. This is Shakir Khan. 
 In case you don't know who I am... 
 But this is a life-and-death emergency. 
 Can I at least speak to his lieutenant, Karim, please? 
 Karim? Well, then why... 
 Yes, I know, but... 
 I will ask. 
 Karim : He will not speak to you directly. 
 [line clicks, dial tone] 
 Did you speak to the general? 
 Yes, of course. He'll protect me. 
 I told you not to worry. 
 There, you see? You're gonna stay here with Shakir. 
 It's safe. 
 But what will you do? 
 How will you get out of Bamako? 
 How will you get out of Africa? 
 Aslam is right. The desert is no place to be alone. 
 Where will you take her? 
 Tienfala. 
 Clever boy. 
 My clever, clever boy. 
 What? What's going on? 
 You will find your way to Europe from Tienfala. 
 Aslam will take you there. You must go. 
 [smooches] I have your tape. 
 I will get it to this  New York Times   reporter. 
 We'll get your story out. I promise. 
 And you my sweet, sweet boy... 
 [sighs] 
 Promise me you won't disappear from me this time, hmm? 
 You are my only family. 
 You will protect yourself, hmm? 
 All right big boy... now, last question... how will you get there? 
 When it's over, you will come back to see me, yes? 
 [woman speaking indistinctly] 
 I'm back. 
 Can I help you? 
 I need to see Mr. Tenant still. 
 Do you have an appointment? 
 Uh, no. 
 That would still be a no. 
 Please... tell him it's about Yusuf, Darnell, and the Jack of Spades. 
 Can you repeat that for me? 
 Please... it's important. 
 Yusuf, Darnell, and the Jack of Spades. 
 Your name? 
 Harrison Walters still. 
 A Harrison Walters to see Mr. Tenant. 
 He says it's about Yusuf, Darnell, and the Jack of Spades. 
 Oh, okay. 
 I'll send him up. 
 30th floor. 
 Yeah, I know. 
 Thanks for your help. 
 Tenant : This better be good. 
 Senator Thomas Darnell, your former boss... 
 What did he have to do with Black Sands? 
 Black Sands was a GBR project. 
 Tom Darnell was CEO at the time... 
 And what's he got to do with Yusuf Qasim? 
 What makes you think he has anything to do with a dead terrorist? 
 Yusuf... you found him. 
 He's alive, isn't he? 
 He needs to know... you need to tell him that we did not double-cross him. 
 It was Amir Alamara. 
 You tell him that. 
 Who's Amir Alamara? 
 He'll know. 
 What about Senator Darnell? 
 How's he mixed up in all this? 
 Is it true? 
 Is Yusuf alive? 
 Tell me about Darnell. 
 You tell me about Yusuf, and I'll tell you about Darnell. 
 Otherwise, this meeting is over. 
 
 
 
 What... what are you doing here? You look like crap. 
 Can I come in? 
 No, not now. 
 Michele, I'll be right back. 
 What happened? 
 What do you mean? 
 Oh, I don't know, Peter. 
 Last time I saw you, you asked me for Jenji's number. 
 Now you show up on my doorstep looking like you've seen a ghost. 
 What happened, Joe, is that we got evidence, evidence that can bury SOC. 
 Good. So use it. 
 I can't, which is why I need your help. 
 I need you... 
 Why can't you use it? 
 I just need you to come forward with what you know, testify, and then they can subpoena SOC, find out what I've got and use it in court. 
 Why? Why can't you use what you've got in court? 
 What happened? 
 It didn't exactly go as planned... 
 How bad? 
 [sighs] 
 Jenji? Holy crap. 
 We're this close... 
 No, no, no, no. No, Peter. No, Peter. 
 If this is anything close to what I think it is, you need to just go home and wait for the cops. 
 You're screwed. 
 Joe, Joe, Joe. 
 Stay away from me. See you in prison, Peter. 
 Joe. 
 Stay away.

 Why haven't you called me back? 
 I'm scared, my general, so scared. 
 Please come. 
 Please tell me you work for the   New York Times. 
 And who are you? 
 I'm a reporter just like you. 
 Well, maybe not the   New York Times   like you, but I do have a show here in Bamako. 
 Shakir Khan. 
 Where is Odelle Ballard? 
 She had to leave. 
 Some soldiers, American, have been chasing her. 
 What soldiers? 
 Oselas, here in Bamako, and they are killing people and are trying to track down Odelle to kill her. 
 You've seen them... the Oselas? 
 Well, no, not personally. 
 But it is the reason she had to leave. 
 I'm not lying. 
 She made a tape for you, for you to take with you. 
 Please, come to my apartment. 
 Shakir : It's just upstairs, and I'll give it to you. 
 No, I think the better idea is for you to bring it to me, here. 
 Oh, of course. 
 You think that maybe I'm... 
 I'll bring it right away.

 Peter? 
 [door slams] 
 Peter? 
 I-I wasn't feeling well, so I decided to work from home for a bit. 
 Where are you going? 
 Be right back. 
 Harrison : Amir Alamra... a storekeeper at Nabisco Manufacturing in Malaysia. 
 It's got to be him. 
 [cell phone ringing] 
 Anna, what's up? 
 Harrison, you were supposed to meet us here. 
 Uh, where? "Us"? What do you mean? 
 My friends from work... I wanted you to meet them. 
 You don't remember... 
 All right, what if it's not a name? 
 What if it means something, the word? 
 I think you're pronouncing it wrong. 
 Anna : Wait, who are you talking to? 
 I just don't think he said Alamra. 
 Let me guess, it's Bob. 
 Harrison, this is getting pathetic... 
 It's Amir UL-Umara. 
 Listen, I got to go, okay? 
 It means "leader of leaders" in Arabic. 
 [cell phone beeps] 
 Try leaders in Punjab Province, Pakistan, 2010. 
 Already doing it. Done. 
 Harrison : Hello. 
 Is that... 
 Yusuf was betrayed by Abdul Abbas? 
 Why would a terrorist betray a terrorist? 
 We've got to talk to him. 
 You mean the guy who said he never wanted to see us again, the guy with the gun? 
 I'm gonna go. 
 You can stay here if you want to. 
 No, I'll go. 
 Maybe if he knows I wiped every trace of him from the Internet, he won't shoot us. 
 It must be so much harder for you, with everyone saying she might still be alive. 
 It must be good to have that over. 
 Well... 
 I don't know that it is... certainly not for Suzanne. 
 What? 
 I-I'm sure it's nothing. 
 It has to do with Odelle's wedding ring... 
 What about it? 
 Okay, I'll tell you, but you have to promise not to make too big a deal of it. 
 I'm sure there's an explanation. 
 Odelle and I had our wedding date engraved on our rings when we got married. 
 But on our honeymoon Odelle discovered that the jeweler got the date wrong on hers... 
 [scoffs] One day off. 
 We always used to joke that we weren't really married because of the wrong date. 
 But this morning I looked at Odelle's wedding ring and... 
 The date is right. 
 It's not her ring! They got it wrong! 
 I'm not sure it means anything. 
 Maybe she changed it. 
 Just didn't tell you. 
 Maybe. 
 Mom would never do that, and you know it. 
 Dolly. 
 All right, come on, what's in Tienfala? 
 Why was Shakir smiling when you told him about it? 
 Because it's so far, on the edge of the desert. 
 And? 
 Luc is there. 
 He just tried to kill us! 
 Yes, but he's a drug smuggler. He knows all the routes. 
 Then you can give your flash drive to the   New York Times. 
 No, don't his "routes" take us all the way back to where I just came from? 
 I don't want to do that. 
 I'm an American soldier, a white woman. 
 He's not going to protect me from the Ansar Dine. 
 He'll probably try to sell me to them. 
 So what's your idea, huh... to buy a plane ticket? 
 Great. Where is your passport? 
 We just want to just keep making phone calls until they catch you and kill you? 
 No. 
 Luc is our only hope. 
 But the man wants me dead. 
 How am I gonna convince him to try and help us? 
 It is up to you.

 Maya? 
 I'm going to ask you something, and I need you to be completely honest with me. 
 I saw Cameron at the hospital, and when I asked him what happened, who beat him up, he told me to ask you. 
 Why would he do that?

 Maya, I have no idea. 
 Do you honestly think your father would be involved in something like that?

 Is your husband home? 
 Yes. He'll be finished soon. What is this about? 
 I'm sorry. I need to speak with him directly, ma'am. 
 Um... [clears throat] 
 Peter... the police are here to see you. 
 Watkins : We were hoping to catch you home. 
 Sorry to intrude. 
 Not at all. 
 How have you been? 
 Okay. Working hard. 
 But, uh, today I'm home, trying to relax a bit. 
 We're here on a homicide investigation. 
 Know him? 
 No. 
 You sure? 
 Yes. I'm sure. Why would you think I... 
 His prints match the ones found in the van that killed Danny Gentry. 
 He was the driver. 
 And since your ID was used to rent the van... 
 We've been through this. 
 My ID was stolen. I had nothing to do with it. 
 I know. 
 Where was he found? 
 In a vacant lot off Wythe Ave. 
 Why? 
 Just curious. 
 And you're certain you don't know this man, never seen him before? 
 Sorry I can't be more helpful. 
 Why are you wasting my time? 
 Well, you're the one who wanted to know what was on it so badly, you stole it from Aslam. 
 Well, that was before. Now I don't care... 
 Well, the fact that an American company pays terrorists millions of dollars, that's got to count for something... surely, a lot of something. 
 And I know you care about that. 
 All right, Yusuf Qasim... 
 I found his name in the decrypted material. 
 What do you know about Yusuf Qasim? 
 Rumor is that Qasim was set up by his pal Abbas. 
 But I thought that he was killed by Special Forces. 
 You see? 
 Do you see why the drive is so valuable? 
 Yes. 
 And I can also see why they want to kill you for it, why they kill everyone you come in contact with. 
 Look, I know exactly what you're trying to do here, but the money's not worth it. 
 You're in a war, a war I don't care about. 
 This is between you and them. 
 So tomorrow morning you and that little thief are going to leave my house and get as far away from me as possible. 
 Got it? 
 It went bad. 
 Tsaldari : How bad? 
 About as bad as it could go. 
 It was self-defense. 
 [speaking native language] 
 Peter... 
 It wasn't me. 
 I was there. 
 They had cameras. Fingerprints. 
 They have me. 
 Felony murder. 
 Why haven't I been arrested? 
 And why would SOC hide the body in some vacant lot in Brooklyn? 
 Tsaldari : It must be what you found. 
 What did you get? 
 Peter : I-I don't know, I didn't look. 
 Why not? 
 Because I saw someone get killed right in front of my eyes. 
 I had to get rid of the evidence, protect myself. 
 But that information is your protection. 
 The fact that you have that evidence is the only reason you're not in jail right now. 
 They're afraid. 
 You need to hang on to it. 
 Protect it with your life. 
 I have to go. 
 He's not going to help us, is he? 
 No, honey, he's not. 
 And he wants us to leave by the morning, and I don't know where we're gonna go. 
 Maybe back to Bamako. 
 I could try and get a passport even though it's a risk. 
 Get on a plane and fly away from all of this. 
 Your picture is everywhere, from the Al Jazeera photo. 
 And the people who make fake passports work with the Ansar Dine, who are still looking for you. 
 And even if you were able to do that, what would happen to me? 
 And then we will talk about what you should do with me. 
 Hey, you. 
 Take it easy with this, okay? 
 It doesn't mean anything yet. 
 But you're not sure she's dead anymore, are you? 
 I'll make some calls tomorrow, okay? 
 Now get some sleep. 
 Yes! 
 Odelle on phone : Hey, you've reached Sergeant Odelle Ballard. 
 I'll be out of touch for the next few weeks. 
 So leave me a message and I'll call you back as soon as I can. 
 And if this is you, Suzy Q, I miss you and I'll be home before you know it.

 You got the ring wrong. We know she's alive.

 What's that in your hand? 
 Work. [clears throat] 
 What kind of work are you doing down here in the middle of the night, and why does it involve washing a jump drive in the kitchen sink? 
 I can't tell you everything right now. 
 But I've got it under control. 
 Peter. 
 When Maya asked you earlier if you had anything to do with Cameron getting attacked, and you said "no..." 
 Were you telling the truth? 
 Yes. 
 I'm not sure I believe you. 
 Believe what you want.

 This is not good. 
 Hey, what's going on? 
 Nothing. 
 Doesn't look like nothing. 
 Nothing to worry about. False tip.

 Not yet. 
 Someone must've tipped 'em off about Yusuf. 
 And I know who.

 Harrison, what's going on? 
 Harrison : I trusted you about Yusuf. 
 How could you!

 Hello? 
 Hello? 
 Yeah, I'm here.
