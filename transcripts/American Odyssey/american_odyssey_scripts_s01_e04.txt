 Flash drive, huh ? 
 I have a rich uncle. 
 I'm sure he is handsome as well. 
 Aslam? 
 I want to show you something. 
 Financial dealing that I find disturbing. 
 The colonel is lying. You were right son. 
 Got a source. Let me talk to him. 
 What do you have on Ballard? 
 You can't. 
 It's too hot.

 Al-Qaeda. 
 They only think of one thing, vengeance. 
 Hamid can't even look at you without seeing red. 
 I'm different... I'm your only friend in the world. 
 You will never know the truth unless you stop this!

 Hamid was a fool, short-sighted. 
 By killing him, I have done the Azawad Liberation Movement a favor. 
 So now what? 
 Now we wait to see if you live or die. 
 Aslam. 
 Pray they find him and he has this flash drive you say is so valuable. 
 They will. 
 [dramatic music] 
 [grunts] 
 Speak English. 
 Others may disagree about him, and they'll be angry. 
 And if it turns out I've killed him over nothing, I promise you, there will be no end to your suffering.

 I have proof of what SOC has done, what they're hiding.

 They're... they're fronting terrorism, Sarah. 
 They're killing our own troops for profit. 
 Now, I have no idea how high up this goes, but I have to find out.

 How do you all of a sudden know all of this? 
 Who have you been talking to? 
 That doesn't matter. 
 It matters to me. 
 [sighs] 
 She reached out to me. 
 Sophia. 
 You spoke to her. 
 After everything we've been through? 
 I was doing my job, Sarah. 
 Societele asked me to arrange a meeting with her. 
 Now I know why. 
 She has hard evidence, and now I have it. 
 She asked for you specifically. 
 What... what do you want... What am I supposed to do? 
 Say no. 
 You know I can't. 
 Say no. 
 You know I can't do that. 
 Say... Let her find someone else. 
 You know I can't do that. 
 Yes, you can. Yes, you can. 
 You have to. 
 Haven't you two done enough harm already? 
 I made a mistake four years ago. 
 This has nothing to do with that. 
 Give it all to Ed Dixon. 
 You let the Justice Department handle it, and then you walk away. 
 I already spoke to Ed. 
 I'm meeting with him tomorrow. 
 Okay? Hey, okay? 
 Good.

 Hey, I just heard. 
 Oh, Anna. 
 I'm so sorry. 
 Oh. 
 Will you get her something to drink? 
 I'm... I'm fine. 
 You came at the perfect time. 
 We were just going over the funeral details. 
 Everything needs to be just right. 
 Hey, it... it will be. 
 I haven't even thought about the eulogy. 
 Harrison, you... You'll write it. 
 Me? I wouldn't... 
 I wouldn't know what to say. 
 Well, just talk from your heart, dear. 
 The newspapers. 
 Ho, ho, ho, they'll be brutal. 
 Killed by a jilted mistress. 
 Such a cliché. 
 If that's really how he died. 
 What are you talking about? 
 He wasn't having an affair. 
 He and I were working on something. 
 It was a story. 
 He was... he was killed because I... 
 Harrison, he was... having an affair. 
 Your father had been seeing her for a while. 
 Um, I should go. 
 No, no, no, don't be silly. 
 The whole world will know soon enough. 
 I wasn't happy about it, Harrison. 
 That said, we will celebrate his life. 
 Your father did great things. 
 He was a good man down deep. 
 You think about that, and you write him a beautiful eulogy. 
 [news program theme plays] Suzanne. 
 Thought we had a deal. 
 No news. 
 They're not talking about her anymore anyways. 
 You think you might be able to go back to school tomorrow? 
 Do I have to?

 Hello? 
 Ron? 
 This is Stephen Glen. 
 Is this a good time? 
 Sure, hang on. 
 Go ahead. 
 (Glen) We've recovered more remains. 
 The last three soldiers, including Odelle. 
 They're being flown to Dover Air Base now. 
 Are you certain it's her? 
 Tissue samples and dental records confirm. 
 I'm truly sorry, Ron, but at least now you have closure. 
 When can I see her? 
 My advice, you don't. 
 There's nothing recognizable, I'm afraid. 
 May I make a suggestion? 
 Okay? 
 Authorize the Army to cremate her remains. 
 It'll save you and Suzanne the torment. 
 All right. 
 I mean, wait.

 She was with the Americans who killed Abdul Abbas. 
 Abdul Abbas? 
 Why on earth is she here in Bamako? 
 She was left alone. 
 My father found her. 
 He wanted me to sell her to the Ansar Dine. 
 But you refused, and they shot you. 
 Sounds heroic. 
 Yeah, something like that. 
 She's my friend. 
 She helped me. 
 I have a friend. 
 He's a general in the Malian Army. 
 If anyone can find her, he can.

 Wow, there's the Pulitzer. 
 Your dad knew Bill Clinton? 
 Yeah. 
 Guess they had more in common than I thought. 
 Hmm, no family pictures? 
 Exactly. 
 How the hell am I gonna write this eulogy? 
 I mean, what... what am I gonna say? 
 "My father loved two things: his work and cheating on my mom"? 
 He wasn't that bad. 
 Don't you have one happy memory of him? 
 There's got to be something. 
 My... my... my father loved fishing almost as much as he loved his work, so when I was a kid, he used to drag me up to this lake. 
 I hated it. 
 My father loved every minute of it. 
 He used to try so hard to catch those fish, but he never caught anything, and then one time, I just completely refused to put my line in the water. 
 I just kind of dangled it off the side of the boat, and all of a sudden, this gigantic fish jumped out of the water and right onto my hook. 
 My dad was so pissed at me. 
 Hey, I thought this was a happy memory. 
 It is for me. 
 [chuckles] 
 Hey, John Updike. I love him. 
 Oh, yeah, so did my dad. 
 Rabbit series was his favorite. 
 Yeah, I can see that. 
 Rabbit, Run. You ever read it? 
 No, it's not for me. 
 I loved it. 
 I'm tired. 
 I'm going to bed.

 I surrendered myself. Why would I do that? 
 Osela's your private military.

 I got an email this morning from the Senate Judiciary Oversight Committee. 
 It's a sanction letter. 
 I know it's a sanction letter. 
 You might be used to those, but that's the first one of my career. 
 They just put a target on my back. 
 It's nonspecific... How do you know it's because of me? 
 Because it happened after I told Sanchez about your SOC document. 
 Could be a coincidence. 
 There's no such thing as coincidence in the Justice Department.

 So what are you going to do? 
 Sanchez set a meeting with me for next week. 
 We'll get into it. 
 No, no. 
 That's... that's too late. 
 SOC is on notice. 
 They... they're probably destroying evidence as we speak. 
 We got to press 'em today. Now. 
 I will press them when the time is right. 
 Oh, come on. 
 We got a paper trail.

 How does a boy like you come to know an American woman soldier? 
 I met her in the desert. 
 We helped each other. 
 She's not in Bamako. 
 An American woman soldier? 
 Believe me, I would know. 
 But the Ansar Dine said they were bringing her here. 
 If the Ansar Dine have her, then she's already dead. 
 If she's alive and with the Ansar Dine, would you know where she is? 
 The safe house. 
 He's not speaking to you. 
 You know I'm right. 
 The Ansar Dine have very little say in Bamako, but there is one place they go to hide. 
 Tell him. 
 Why are you being so stubborn?

 My buddy works the evidence room at the 15th precinct.

 He's the one who broke into my car and took Gentry's diary.

 Anything more on Alex Baker? 
 Yeah, it's huge. 
 Yeah? 
 I got my hands on a document. 
 A transfer of 35 million U.S. from SOC to al-Qaeda in North Africa. Yeah. 
 Those Special Ops must have found out about it. 
 SOC used Gentry to have them killed. 
 Are you serious? 
 Yeah, I threw in the evidence over to the DOJ, but they... they're just sitting on it. 
 They're afraid. 
 My friend got sanctioned by the Senate Judiciary. 
 Baker's got influence. 
 I need to light a fire, let them know I know.

 Bob, who are you talking about when you say "they" killed my father? 
 I mean, do you even know this, or is this just... 
 The police think your father's lady friend killed him, okay? 
 How do they explain this? 
 What am I looking at? 
 Your father's mistress. 
 I did some research. 
 The woman just bought a new condo in Dallas. 
 She listed her house in Connecticut for sale. 
 She even bought airline tickets to DFW next week, for crying out loud. 
 Wait, let me see this. 
 She's starting a new life. 
 She wrote emails to her friends about a new beginning without your dad. 
 A new job. Look. 
 She even bought a puppy. 
 Does that sound like a suicidal woman? 
 I don't know. I mean, she could have... 
 She was murdered, Harrison. 
 She was caught in the wrong place at the wrong time. 
 [cell phone rings] 
 Don't answer that. 
 It's just Ruby. 
 No, you're not here. 
 Bob, no, you need to relax. 
 Look, your father was killed because he asked too many people too many questions. 
 You guys even spoke to that colonel. 
 The whole thing. 
 I mean, that woman soldier may be alive, but if... if we keep asking questions, they're gonna kill us too. 
 Come on.
