 Previously on "Damien"... 
 Damien : There's always been some thing, like a dark cloud hanging over me. 
 When that old woman grabbed me, it was like it was inside me now, growing. 
 Man : What brings you to the V.A.? 
 There's a doc downstairs who deals with PTSD. 
 I was in the field a long time. 
 Minute I got back to New York, all went south from there.

 Damien. 
 How long have I been here? 
 Since yesterday. 
 How are you feeling? 
 Woman : The worst that's happened is he knows what's been going on. 
 You know, it's a good thing they found you when they did. 
 I know you've had a hard time lately, but I just want you to know that we're gonna help. 
 Okay? You're safe. 
 Am I? 
 Are you family? 
 No. 
 Then I need to ask you to step out so we can speak privately. 
 Of course. 
 I'll talk to you later. 
 Look, I don't know what that lady told you, but I... I wasn't doing anything that was... 
 You weren't trying to commit suicide? 
 Ms. Rutledge just explained to me that you've been treated for substance abuse. 
 She said this whole thing was probably an accident. 
 That's true. 
 (PAGER BEEPING) 
 I know a suicide when I see one, Mr. Thorn. 
 We're keeping you for 72-hour observation. 
 And I believe the police want to speak to you. 
 There's a Detective Shay on his way.

 I brought my friend. 
 What'd you want to tell him? 
 I don't want trouble, okay? 
 He's not a cop, all right? You can talk to him. 
 I don't know. About six months ago, I'm here all alone, closing up shop. 
 Two guys walk in. 
 They ask if I could drop ink on somebody who's passed out. 
 You know, like a gag. 
 Only these two guys don't look like they're joking. 
 What'd you tell them? 
 That, uh, you know, I got professional standards. 
 That's frat-house bullshit. 
 It's not how I do business. 
 They said, uh... 
 They said that they would break my arms if I didn't do it. 
 Wouldn't be able to wipe my own ass for months. 
 So much for professional standards. 
 Well, they popped the trunk. 
 There was this guy inside. 
 It was you. 
 What? 
 They told me to do it. 
 To do what? 
 That thing on your head, under your hairline. 
 What thing? 
 The tattoo. 
 The number 666.

 Damien! 
 Hey, Damien! 
 Is it true? 
 Geez! What the... 
 Hey! What are you doing? 
 Where did find this guy? 
 Hey, what... 
 Where'd you find him? 
 Hey, no, he found me, okay? 
 He said he saw you at the V.A. hospital the other day. 
 (ELECTRICITY CRACKLING) 
 He was worried you might recognize him. 
 He wanted to come clean about something. 
 So he called the Times, and he got my number instead of yours. 
 All right? 
 Now, you want to tell me what the hell's going on? 
 I'm not sure. 
 Why would someone want to put a tattoo on your head? 
 It doesn't make any sense. 
 (INDISTINCT WHISPERING) 
 What is it? Hey. 
 You all right? 
 I got to talk to someone. 
 I will... I will call you later, and I will explain everything, all right? 
 Arlene : Mr. Lyons isn't expecting you. 
 Damien : Oh, this won't take up much of his time. 
 (SIGHS) Sorry to bother you, sir. 
 There's a Mr. Thorn here to see you? 
 Thank you, Arlene. 
 I need to talk to you about Ann Rutledge. 
 Do you have any idea... how much danger you're in? 
 So you believe me? 
 Yes, I do. 
 Ann Rutledge is more than just toxic. 
 I believe she's a genuine psychopath. 
 This thing goes much further and deeper than some tattoo. 
 It goes back decades. 
 ♪ 
 I think this has been happening my entire life. 
 I mean, she really had me believing I was the devil or something. 
 Like, faces showing up in... in photographs, people knowing my name, saying things to me. 
 The... the stuff I saw in the basement of that V.A. hospital was like something from a nightmare. 
 That's what psychological warfare is, Damien. 
 She made you imagine things, or misinterpret things. 
 No, this was not my imagination. 
 It was too real. It was like... 
 Ann : The past is like a noose around our necks. 
 I imagine you don't remember much. 
 I'd never do anything to hurt you. 
 It was like a hallucination. 
 I found trace amounts of Apocynaceae Cetanus in your blood. 
 Apocynaceae...? 
 Cetanus. 
 It's a rare but powerful psychoactive derivative that's found exclusively in plants growing in the Ecuadorian rainforest. 
 What exactly does it do? 
 It's used in religious ceremonies to contact spirits. 
 It causes intense hallucinations. 
 It also increases suggestibility. 
 How many times has Ann Rutledge been in your apartment? 
 Twice. That I know of. 
 Is this the same Ann Rutledge that I was speaking with? 
 She was here? 
 She seemed very concerned that I call what looked like a suicide attempt an accident. 
 Mr. Thorn, if some sort of crime has been committed, I'm obligated to report it. 
 We'll handle that. 
 I hope we can count on your testimony if it's necessary. 
 Oh... You've been a great help, Dr. Rose. 
 Thank you. 
 Lyons : All that blood test proves is that there are drugs in your system. 
 It doesn't prove who put them there. 
 You and I know exactly who put them there. 
 We also know who's behind all of this. 
 We just need to start building our case. 
 I have to be completely honest with you. 
 It wasn't just Ann Rutledge. 
 I played a role, too. 
 What are you saying? 
 After your parents died, your legal guardians just packed you off from one boarding school to another. 
 You had money. That was never an issue. 
 But no one seemed to be taking a true parental interest in you. 
 Except for Ann Rutledge. 
 I thought it was coming from a good place. 
 So, who the hell is she? Where's she from? 
 That's just it... I have no idea. 
 Her government clearances go very high. 
 But I've never been able to verify a single thing about her history. 
 For all intents and purposes, she's a ghost. 
 But she isn't. 
 She's just a person, which means I can bring her down. 
 She's covered her tracks too well. 
 The feds couldn't pin a thing on her. 
 So, what, we just stand here and do nothing? 
 We don't bring in outsiders to clean up our messes. 
 We'll handle this in-house. 
 I'll take care of Ann Rutledge... personally.

 (CELLPHONE CHIMES) 
 Hey, Amani. It's me. 
 I need you to do me a favor. 
 (INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS) 
 Ann : I've been so worried about you. 
 (TAPPING) 
 I'm fine. 
 I'm so glad. 
 When I heard what happened... what you did... 
 I couldn't believe it. 
 I feel like my life's been given back to me. 
 Huh. 
 Well, maybe it was part of the larger process. 
 You're maturing. 
 Finally accepting who you really are. 
 Who is that, exactly? 
 I'd like to hear it from you. 
 (SCOFFS) Is this a game? 
 You tell me. 
 You're the second of only two prophets whose coming is foretold in the Bible. 
 In Isaiah 14:12, God calls you "Son of the Morning." 
 You bring the beginning of an era of enlightenment. 
 The Light Bringer. 
 That describes you perfectly. 
 You're lying. 
 I met Ed Bone. 
 Tattoo artist that gave me the 666. 
 That wasn't a tattoo. 
 You've been poisoning me. 
 Making me think things, believe things that simply aren't true. 
 I can explain. 
 You did this to me. 
 You had people killed. You killed Kelly. 
 Everything I did was for you. 
 I'm done listening to you. 
 I'm done talking to you. I'm done... with you. 
 Forever. 
 You're not done. Sit down. 
 You really think you're my mother, don't you, you crazy, murderous bitch? 
 (INHALES DEEPLY) You're not. 
 She's dead. 
 Maybe you'll have something in common with her soon. 
 Goodbye, Ann.

 I-I feel like my life is... 
 Maybe my life is... Is just a normal life. 
 So, that's what this is? You're happy? 
 (SIGHS) 
 I got to be honest, I've never seen you like this before. 
 You seem different. You even look different. 
 Is that good? 
 That's great. 
 (ROCK MUSIC CONTINUES) 
 (DOOR OPENS) 
 Yo, man. You left your door open. 
 Am I interrupting something? 
 So, listen, I did what you asked. 
 Got the meeting with Rutledge covered. 
 Great. 
 And then after she left, I followed her. 
 Now, you need to see this. 
 All right. 
 So, there she is leaving the restaurant, right? 
 And I followed her towards Central Park. 
 And then she meets up with this guy. 
 (CAMERA BEEPING) 
 Did you hear what they were saying? 
 Are you kidding me? I could barely get these shots. 
 What's going on? 
 I think the cloud might be coming back. 
 Damien : This doesn't feel right. 
 If they're both playing me, they're working together. 
 I just don't know why. 
 I think we should call the cops. 
 No. 
 If there's one thing that Lyons told me that I completely believe it's that the cops can't do anything against a company like Armitage. 
 Whatever their plan is, they clearly think it's working. 
 They don't know that I'm onto them. 
 That buys me time. 
 No. Dude, even if we had 100 years, we'd never have access to what we need to try to figure out what they're doing. 
 Damien : I lost my phone. 
 I think I may have left it here this morning. 
 Well, he's just at a lunch meeting. 
 I mean, he should be back soon. 
 May I? 
 Uh... I could call it for you. 
 That's what I do with mine when I can't find it. 
 You can just ask for my number if you want it.

 Uh... I leave my phone on silent. 
 Um... okay.

 Woman : Hello? 
 Uh, hello. My name is Damien Thorn. 
 What did you say? 
 Who... who is this? 
 Damien Thorn. 
 That's impossible. 
 ♪ 
 Damien? 
 It really is you. 
 Oh... 
 It's me, mom. 
 I can't believe it. 
 You're here. You're alive. 
 When I think what this must have been like for you... 
 God... 
 I should've been stronger. 
 I should've come back. Maybe if I had... 
 Why didn't you? 
 I was still bedridden in the clinic in Fribourg when they told me that you and your father were dead. 
 They said that he had gone crazy and... stabbed you, and that then the police had arrived and shot him. 
 It was like a nightmare. 
 It wasn't until months later, when I saw your graves, that I realized it was all really true. 
 Or so I thought. 
 And I was so ashamed. 
 Of what? 
 They put ideas in my head, Mrs. Baylock and the others... 
 The way they looked at you, and the things they said... 
 I realize now that they were doing whatever they could to make me fear you, to make me think that there was something wrong with you. 
 Maybe there was. 
 I had these impulses. 
 I mean, when you fell over the banister, when I ran into you with my bike... 
 No. 
 There was never anything wrong with you. 
 And there's nothing wrong with you now. 
 They drugged me... This Rutledge woman. 
 She poisoned my food. Tattooed my head. 
 Kelly, they... They... killed her. 
 They've been at it my whole life. 
 I have no one. 
 Whenever I got close to anybody... 
 These are very sick, dangerous people. 
 Why? 
 Because there is nothing more truly terrifying than somebody who really believes that their actions are divinely justified. 
 By heaven or by hell. 
 It's over now. 
 They don't know you're here. 
 They don't know we know. 
 I can't give you back the years that they took from us. 
 But I promise you, I won't let them hurt you ever again. 
 Your father kept his papers in the library. 
 Journals, datebooks, personal correspondence. 
 We might be able to find some information that we can use in there. 
 There are things that you need to know. 
 I'm afraid that everything you've learned so far is just the tip of the iceberg. 
 (DOOR OPENS, SLAMS) 
 (FOOTSTEPS) 
 What the hell are you doing here? 
 Ann : I need to explain things. 
 You knew, didn't you? 
 Yes, I knew. 
 I've never lied to you. 
 You've been lying to me since the day we met. 
 You knew all these years that my child was still alive, and you kept us apart? 
 There's a greater need to be served. 
 You stole years of our lives, and for what? 
 Every night, I went to sleep begging God to forgive me for not being here to protect him. 
 From your husband? 
 He knew the truth. 
 You took my child away from me, and I am going to see to it that you pay for that every day for the rest of your life. 
 I protected him from people like you. 
 The blind. The weak. 
 I am his mother. 
 Enough lies.

 She is not my friend.

 Okay. Call Ann Rutledge. 
 Call... call John Lyons. Call him and ask him... 
 Uh... D-Dr. Rose.

 What blood test? 
 From when I tried... 
 Tried to kill yourself? 
 Yeah. 
 Yeah, I know all about that, too. 
 Right. There were signs of hallucinogens in my blood. 
 That's not gonna help your argument. 
 She was poisoning me. 
 She... she had me believing I was the Antichrist, that people were dying all around me, that it was my fault. 
 I happen to agree with her. 
 I didn't kill anybody. 
 Then why is there blood on your shirt? 
 You're under arrest. 
 Please! Ann Rutledge is behind all of this!
