 Happy birthday. 
 You remembered. You know what? 
 I can't accept this. 
 It says "Property of Carol Schlitzman" on the bottom. 
 Dang, man, I thought I scratched that off. 
 [Both laugh] 
 Thanks, man, really. 
 Don't thank me yet. I've got the crew coming to the hotel tonight, and once I told them you're turning the big 3-0, they promised to bring the pain. 
 I don't think I recovered from last year.

 [Sighs] Can't get rid of him. Hey, listen, uh, what'd you see? Any chance we can slip back in there? 
 No, it's all closed off. 
 There's gonna be a massacre.

 [Man speaking in native language over P.A.] 
 Who are you looking for? 
 A woman. 
 Who? 
 This, uh, woman grabbed me. She knew my name. 
 Another journalist? 
 No, no, from here, from Damascus. 
 She said stuff. Stuff she couldn't have known. 
 She did... something. 
 I saw memories from my childhood when I was a kid when my parents... no, an accident had happened. 
 Thought you said you don't remember your childhood. 
 No, she brought all back. I was 5. It was my birthday. 
 We gotta find out where these trucks are going. 
 Hey, Kelly! 
 [Machine gunfire] 
 I'm hooking up a ride. 
 This guy says he knows where these people are being relocated. 
 He'll take us there for $500. 
 [Horn honks] 
 Hey, I'll meet you back at the hotel. 
 No, dude, you know better than to just get in a car with a local. 
 We could end up hostages. 
 I have to find her, all right? 
 [Shouting in native language] 
 Hey! Hey! 
 Hey, come on. 
 Amani : Whoa. 
 Whoa, hey, hey, hey, hey! 
 Okay, okay. 
 All journalists are being deported immediately. 
 [Tires peal] 
 [Grunts] 
 I'm sure this will get picked up by "Time," HuffPo, maybe "The New Yorker." 
 You might be looking at a Pulitzer. 
 I have to get back there. 
 You know we shouldn't have been thrown out. 
 The only thing I know is my boss is gonna ask why I'm still doing business with you. 
 Because he's the only one who gets close enough. 
 You have to get us back there. 
 Honey, that's just not gonna happen. 
 You've been banned from entering Syria. 
 Just give it a few months... 
 This can't wait. Something is going on. 
 If this is about the private... 
 No, it's not that. 
 Then what? 
 [Helicopters whirring] 
 [Man shouting in native language over P.A.] 
 [Cell phone rings] 
 Hello? 
 Kelly, it's Damien. 
 [Lowered voice] Are you all right? 
 Where the hell are you? 
 New York. Listen. 
 Did you find out where they relocated the Christians? 
 I-I need to find that old woman, the one who grabbed me. 
 I saw. 
 She grabbed your face and said, "Damien, I love you." 
 Can you find her? 
 Why should I help you? 
 We had something. We did. But... 
 And you just disappeared? 
 No explanation? 
 It was the only way. You have to trust me. 
 I did trust you. 
 Can you find that woman? 
 I'll try. 
 Thank you. 
 [Horn honks] 
 Thank you, Tiffany. I'll take it from here. 
 Damien Thorn. Long time. 
 Good to see you, Cray. I, uh... 
 I hope you don't mind me interrupting. 
 I could use a favor. 
 Hmm. 
 Us Preston Hall brothers have to stick together, right? 
 Haven't seen you in 15 years. 
 Uh, staying in touch... it's not one of my strong suits. 
 I was covering a story in Syria. 
 It's landed me in hot water with the current regime. 
 They won't let me step foot inside the country. 
 You have other connections. 
 Well, I could call Dean Behringer, but he's got his hands full. 
 I really didn't want to call in a favor for something this small. 
 The head of the IMF owes you a favor? 
 Well, aren't they what makes our world go round? 
 Let me talk to my colleagues, see if we can't put our heads together and figure something out. I'm sure there's a solution. 
 I appreciate that. You know, I always said you were one of the good ones. 
 Hmm. You can see yourself out. 
 [Piano playing classical music] 
 Damien Thorn. 
 [Gasps] I can't believe it's really you. 
 It's been a long time. 
 Sorry. Do I know you? 
 Ann Rutledge. 
 Last time I saw you was at your father's funeral. 
 You knew my father. 
 He was such a good man. Impeccable character. 
 For him, to suffer such a tragic death... 
 But you were so young. I imagine you don't remember much. 
 Sadly, no. 
 Mm-hmm. That'll change. 
 Uh, why do you say that? 
 Because it's a whole new world. 
 The seal's been broken, the trumpet blown. 
 I don't follow. 
 Your father would have been proud. 
 You have so much to offer. 
 I, uh, I take pictures. 
 [Chuckles] Humility's an overrated virtue. 
 It couldn't have been easy for you, expelled from school after school, Preston, Exeter, Oxford... you'd think those people would would be more forgiving to a boy so obviously... 
 [Chuckles] Gifted. 
 You seem to know a lot about where I've been. 
 The past is like a noose around our necks. 
 Wouldn't you say? 
 Truth is... I wouldn't be doing my job if I didn't keep my eyes and ears open about Damien Thorn. 
 And what exactly is your job, miss... 
 Rutledge. 
 I suppose it would best be described as the protection business. 
 I look out for special interests. 
 Whose? 
 In my line of work, discretion is paramount. 
 The key is to always maintain a presence without letting people know you've been there all along, right over their shoulder. 
 Every step of the way. 
 I just wanted to introduce myself. 
 It's so exciting to see how much you've grown. 
 Our paths have crossed before, you know, I'm sure of it. 
 [Low growl] 
 [Panting] 
 [Snarling] 
 [Cell phone rings] 
 [Ring] Did you find her? 
 Kelly :  I asked everyone who lived in that encampment. No one had ever seen her. I found something else. 
 I'm back in New York. I'll text you my address. 
 You'll want to see it.

 [Mouse pad clicks, video stops] 
 She's saying, "here's my beloved son, in whom I am well pleased." 
 According to the Gospel of  Matthew,  when John the Baptist baptized Christ, the sky opened and a voice called out those exact words. 
 Christ was supposedly baptized when he turned 30. 
 It was my 30th birthday the day she grabbed me. 
 And you were covered in her blood, weren't you? 
 Baptized in it. 
 Christ started his ministry after his baptism, his preaching. 
 I've been having visions. No, uh... memories... 
 That I haven't had before. 
 There was a party. 
 I was 5. My... parents were still alive. 
 There were, uh... ponies and carousels. 
 And, uh... 
 Someone shouted out my name, that they loved me. 
 My governess was standing on the ledge in front of everyone with a rope around her neck. 
 Uh... She looked straight at me, and she said... 
 "It's all for you." 
 And then she jumped to her death. 
 Jesus. 
 How could that old woman know those exact words? 
 This is why I left, Kelly. I couldn't drag you into this. 
 Into what? 
 This... th-this... sh1t. 
 I thought it was crazy, but there's always been... 
 Someone else, some... some thing, like a... 
 Like a dark cloud hanging over me. 
 I-I've... I've ignored it. I've denied it, but it's always been there. 
 And when that... when that old woman grabbed me, it was like it was... it was inside me now, growing, and... 
 [Door unlocks and opens] 
 This is... my sister, Simone. 
 Damien Thorn. 
 I know who you are. Good to finally meet you. 
 Don't let me interrupt. You guys need anything? 
 We're good. 
 I stay here when I'm in New York. 
 [Door closes] 
 
 
 
 You came all the way back from Damascus for this? 
 Uh... uh... 
 Thank you for... for... for this, for trying to help. 
 Wait. What about that old woman? 
 How are you gonna find her? 
 I have no idea. 
 [Whirring] 
 It's the only shot of the old woman I could find. 
 Look, I told you, I took, like, three, four singles. 
 Look, man, I've been through everything. 
 This is the only image she's in. 
 Then we'll go through everything again even if it takes all night. 
 What's the big deal? 
 [Buzzer sounds] 
 [Horns honk in distance] 
 [Lock clicks, door creaks] 
 [Door closes] 
 I hope I'm not disturbing anything. 
 Uh, actually, we've... 
 Uh, we were just finished up. Um... 
 See if you can find that and call me later? 
 Sure thing. 
 Listen, uh, I would love to, uh, hang. 
 You see how the bossman is, wants what he wants. 
 I know. 
 Was, um, was good to see you. 
 You, too. 
 [Door closes] 
 [Horns honking in distance] 
 These pictures... why do you have them hanging in your home? 
 The pain. 
 That dark cloud that's been following you. 
 You can't let it in. 
 But that doesn't mean you have to shut out everything else, either. 
 No, you're right. 
 You're always right. 
 [Sighs] I looked for stories about your birthday party. 
 I couldn't find anything, but I did find this. 
 The photographer, Jennings, was killed in Megiddo. 
 He knew your father. 
 My father was a public figure. 
 Another death all within the same few weeks. 
 That still doesn't explain anything about the old woman. 
 This article says Jennings died near Megiddo... an archaeological site in Israel. 
 It was the only connection I can find to the Middle East in any of this. 
 I was able to access your father's travel log. 
 He was in Megiddo when Jennings died. 
 Why? 
 The excavation was run by... 
 Carl Bugenhagen, a renowned biblical scholar. 
 Died later that same year. 
 I located a doctoral student who was working with him at the time. 
 He might be worth talking to.

 [Crickets chirping] 
 [Door unlocks and creaks] 
 Professor Reneus? 
 I'm Kelly Baptiste. We spoke on the phone. 
 Oh, yes, yes, the woman from the newspaper. 
 You wanted to know about my old teacher, Bugenhagen. 
 Damien Thorn. 
 May I? 
 [Clock ticking] 
 [Ticking grows louder] 
 I don't have very much time. 
 Thank you for seeing us. 
 Damien's father... 
 I know exactly who you are, Mr. Thorn. 
 You were a bit of an obsession for Dr. Bugenhagen. 
 Why is that? 
 Do you know who he was? 
 A biblical scholar. 
 He was one of the world's leading experts on the Book of  Revelation. 
 My father sought him out. Why? 
 That was a long time ago. 
 We've come a long way to learn why my father, a politician, would seek out a biblical scholar. 
 He was not a God-fearing man. 
 Your father wanted answers... about the Beast. 
 The False Messiah... described in the Book of  Revelation. 
 Servant of Satan. 
 He is to be worshiped like a king. 
 And then his true nature will be revealed. 
 He will become the greatest tyrant the world has ever seen, plunging it into darkness, plague, famine, war... the end of days... until he is defeated by the returned Christ during the Last Judgment. 
 The Antichrist. 
 That word is never actually used in  Revelation,  but the early church fathers believed that the Beast and the Antichrist are the same. 
 Thessalonians  calls him the Man of Lawlessness. 
 The Devil has many names. 
 What does this have to do with my father? 
 He was a diplomat, was he not? 
 Many expect the Beast to come from the world of politics. 
 When  Revelation  was first written... 
 It was the Emperor Nero that recognized him by his number... 
 666. 
 Does that mean anything to you? 
 No. 
 Do these people look familiar? 
 No, I don't believe so. 
 The man was a photographer... 
 Thanks for your time. 
 [Metal creaking] 
 Reneus : Mr. Thorn! 
 [Wind gusting] 
 You must accept Christ as your savior. 
 [Breathing heavily] 
 Accept Christ. It's your only hope. 
 Drink his blood. Eat his flesh. 
 Accept our savior. 
 What are you saying, that my father was right? 
 He may not be fire and brimstone, Mr. Thorn, but the Devil does exist. 
 He lurks in the dark corners of the heart.
