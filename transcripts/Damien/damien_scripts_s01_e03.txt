 Previously on "Damien"... 
 There's always been some thing, like a dark cloud hanging over me. 
 I've ignored it, I've denied it, but it's... it's always been there. 
 Reneus : 666. 
 Does that mean anything to you? 
 [Dogs barking] 
 Woman : When Reneus was killed, the cops say he was mauled by some animal. 
 [Screams] Somebody got me! 
 Two accidents in the past few days. 
 Pretty weird. 
 Man : We know he's here. 
 It's one of the seven daggers of Megiddo. 
 Strike where the heart should be. 
 [Knocking on door] 
 [Grunting] 
 [Screams] 
 The man that tried to kill you, he had one of these, didn't he? 
 Come with me. 
 Welcome home, Damien. 
 [Siren wails in distance] 
 [Phone ringing] 
 Detective Jim Shay? 
 James. 
 I brought you a copy of my file about that professor that was mauled the other night. 
 Uh, yeah. Thank you. 
 Yeah, I was just swinging through. 
 I'm meeting some guys for drinks. 
 Glad I caught you. 
 Christ, what a mess. 
 Look at that body... throat ripped out, teeth marks right down to the bone. 
 It's a brutal way to go for a biblical scholar. 
 Look where all that learning got him. 
 My parents tried to raise me Catholic, I told them they could keep their guilt. 
 Yeah, you never told me how your taxi accident connects with this dog mauling. 
 My deceased was a grad student of this Reneus. 
 He was killed while trying to stab somebody. 
 You have any idea how a pack of wild dogs got into your dead professor's office in the first place? 
 Well, Reneus had a couple of visitors earlier that evening. 
 I'm trying to reach them to corroborate the time lines. 
 Hmm, they give you anything? 
 I spoke briefly to one the night of the attack. 
 I'm still waiting for her to call me back. 
 Do you have their names? 
 Uh, yeah. A reporter... Kelly Baptiste. 
 Yeah, she ain't calling. 
 She died the same night... another freak accident. 
 The other visitor, let me guess. 
 Damien Thorn? 
 You know him? 
 Yeah. 
 [Panting] 
 Thanks for coming by. 
 Yeah, sure thing.

 [Panting] 
 [Ominous music plays] 
 This is a murder weapon. 
 You didn't kill your mother. 
 I ran into her, I knocked her off a balcony. 
 If it wasn't me, then how did she die? 
 Complications. 
 Have... have you been part of this since... 
 I was born? 
 Mm. 
 I wasn't that lucky. 
 I remember a governess. 
 She killed herself at a party. 
 And then there was Mrs. Baylock. 
 Did you know her? 
 [Chuckles] 
 I met her once when I was just a girl. 
 She terrified me. 
 I don't know what happened to her. 
 She was murdered. 
 Your father killed her... the same night he tried to kill you... like Abraham sacrificing Isaac. 
 Abraham lived to become the father of nations. 
 My father was not that lucky. 
 I told you, he wasn't your true father. 
 I was brought in when you lived in the White House. 
 I raised you from afar. 
 I raised myself. 
 Consider me a guiding hand. 
 You were brought in by who? 
 I'm part of a group that exists to protect you. 
 There are many others who wish you'd never been born. 
 I'm starting to agree. 
 I mean, how deep does this go? 
 How many people believe I'm this Antichrist? 
 Honestly, I... 
 Are you honest? 
 Honestly, I don't know. 
 I thought you had all the answers. 
 No one has all the answers. 
 Then this is a waste of time. 
 Some groups want to worship you. 
 Others want you dead. 
 Like that guy who came after me? Who was he? 
 An unprotected pawn. 
 Well, he almost succeeded in trying to kill me. 
 So much for you being my guardian angel. 
 I'm not your only source of protection. 
 There are many complex forces at play. 
 Some want you to fulfill what they consider your destiny. 
 [Chuckles] What, to destroy the world? 
 To fulfill God's will... to bring about the second coming of Christ. 
 Others want to protect the status quo at all costs. 
 It's only a matter of time before the Vatican's forced to act. 
 Wouldn't they want this Second Coming? 
 If the church is good at one thing, it's retaining power. 
 They don't roll over for anyone. 
 And then there are the anarchists and the satanists. 
 The list goes on. 
 What do you want? 
 Just being with you... is enough. 
 Don't push me away. 
 I'm a friend. 
 Before you go, tell me about Damascus. 
 Nothing happened. 
 It's all right. You... You've got a lot to think about. 
 We'll talk again. 
 No, we won't. 
 You can trust me. 
 [Dog barking] 
 Mom, you showed him the shrine? 
 How did he take it? 
 He'll be back. 
 Seems like he couldn't wait to get the hell out of here. 
 Give him time. He's got nowhere else to go. 
 His assailant was a theology student... Hermon Seroyan. 
 Doesn't seem to be connected to any of the big players. 
 Then how did he get a Dagger of Megiddo? 
 No idea. 
 Seems like he was acting alone. 
 [Scoffs] Please. 
 Nobody acts alone. 
 Make sure you're planting them at least 12 inches apart, okay? 
 Father Esparza? 
 Simone, hi. 
 Hi. 
 I was just talking to your parents a little while ago. 
 Thank you for checking in. 
 Can you talk? 
 Of course. 
 What's on your mind? 
 This. 
 It's Kelly's. 
 Huh. 
 Looks like your sister was researching a religious story. 
 Yeah, but her editor doesn't know anything about it. 
 Why are you looking into this? 
 Because it doesn't make any sense. 
 It may never make sense. 
 I'm not talking about Kelly's death, I'm talking about how weird this is. 
 She was researching the Book of Revelation, the Devil. 
 No, I understand. 
 You're searching for a connection, you're looking for answers that are not there. 
 I'm not crazy. 
 I didn't say you were, honey, but you've suffered a huge loss. 
 Thanks, Father. 
 Simone. 
 Simone! 
 [Siren wails in distance, glass breaks] 
 [Crows cawing loudly] 
 [Choir singing ominously] 
 Father! 
 Father! 
 What is it? 
 You gotta see this. Look. 
 What is it? 
 Look. 
 Yes, Santa Maria dei Cappuccini Maternity Hospital, Rome. 
 Si, si, grazie. 
 Burned down when? 
 Uh, what about all the hospital records? 
 [Door opens] 
 No, nothing else. Thank you. 
 You ever hear of an Armitage Global? 
 Yeah, international finance, banking. 
 Well, there's a big-shot... Ann Rutledge. 
 She has all this stuff of mine in her house. 
 What were you doing at her house? 
 She's got a ton of photos, all this stuff from my childhood... my school uniform, my first camera. 
 Whoa. 
 A whole shrine. 
 Of your stuff? 
 Yeah. 
 [Scoffs] 
 No one's ever gonna believe Ann Rutledge is your stalker. 
 Well, you believe me. 
 I think you've had a lot of very weird sh1t going on. 
 You've had a hell of a time these past 10 days. 
 Look, Simone and I went through Kelly's stuff. 
 She had all these notes on you, bible stuff. 
 We saw the tape. 
 What did that old lady do to you? 
 What is all this? 
 I can't explain it. 
 Why did you Photoshop her in here? 
 I didn't Photoshop her, she just appeared in them. 
 I saw her here in New York. 
 The one in Damascus, here in New York? 
 I spoke to her. 
 She... 
 She what? 
 She... ugh. 
 Look, man, I get it. 
 You've been through a lot lately. 
 What do you say we get out of here and get some much needed R&R? 
 We got a few weeks before we head out. 
 I got us a gig in Kiev for, uh... 
 Harold Rolston. 
 We don't work for Reuters. 
 Yeah, well, we do now. 
 Ceci fired us. 
 Her bosses gave her no choice. 
 She... 
 She didn't want to tell you at the funeral. 
 Well, I can't deal with that. 
 Now, if you want to cover the Ukraine, you have to go without me. I gotta stay here. 
 Yeah, man, yeah. Whatever you need. 
 [Indistinct conversations] 
 Woman : Thanks a lot. 
 This doesn't make any sense. 
 Thorn's girlfriend, she died a few days ago... freak accident. 
 You think Thorn had something to do with it? 
 Not unless he summoned the earth to swallow her whole. 
 That's her... the one that died in the sinkhole up in the Bronx. 
 Jesus. 
 And the vic that got pinned by the cab attacked Thorn the day of her funeral. 
 Meanwhile upstate, Dumpster boy's teacher gets mauled to death by a pack of wild dogs... the night that she dies. 
 And guess who went to go visit Professor Alpo only hours before he died. 
 That's three dead by freak accident. 
 That's the holy trinity. 
 That's crazy sh1t. 
 Yeah. 
 [Knock on door, door opens] 
 Woman : Sir, he's here. 
 Hold on. 
 You know, there always comes a moment when all your work... might just fall apart. 
 Never gonna happen. 
 I had a real boat once. 
 Till it capsized in the Caymans. 
 What a nice surprise. 
 How long has it been? 
 Since Preston Hall. 
 It's great to see you looking so well, Mr. Lyons. 
 John... please. 
 We're old pals from when I was whipping boy to the First Lady. 
 You were her Chief of Staff. 
 Oh, the same difference. Drink? 
 No, thanks. 
 These always looked so intricate and complicated. 
 An inscrutable puzzle. 
 Sharpens the mind, helps when other parts aren't quite shipshape anymore. 
 But I doubt you came here to talk about the indignities of aging. 
 I need a favor. 
 Like that time when you were 6 and trashed all the crystal vases in the East Wing? 
 [Chuckles] 
 What a mess. 
 You never did rat me out to the First Lady. 
 Wasn't hard for her to figure out. 
 There were a number of things she held you responsible for. 
 I did wonder why I was whisked out of there. 
 There were places better suited to caring for a young boy than the White House. 
 We knew those boarding schools would give you everything you needed. 
 What can I do for you? 
 Are you here about that fracas in Syria? 
 No. 
 I need some information. 
 I'm not quite as inside as I used to be. 
 I doubt that. 
 We all know people, Damien. 
 Ann Rutledge. 
 You know her? 
 I do. We met at the White House. 
 So she did work there? 
 Why are you so interested in her? 
 Because she seems to have taken an unnatural interest in me. 
 I had a colleague... 
 Brent Warner, senior economic advisor. 
 Brent discovered Ann was secretly funneling billions in military contracts to Armitage. 
 I thought Armitage Global was a financial services company. 
 They have many interests... one of which is a private security force... a mercenary army. 
 I may have come across them. 
 They're everywhere. 
 Brent was preparing to launch an investigation. 
 Ann got wind of it. 
 What happened? 
 It was Christmas eve. 
 The tree that Brent, his wife, and three young daughters had so beautifully decorated with angels and twinkling lights mysteriously caught fire. 
 Their house in Georgetown went up in flames while the family slept. 
 Everyone was incinerated. 
 Another fire. 
 The hospital where I was born in Rome... burned down. 
 They said it was an accident. 
 Be careful, Damien. 
 I've seen more than my fair share in my day. 
 Not much surprises or frightens me. 
 Ann Rutledge does both. 
 [Sighs] 
 I went to see Father Esparza to talk about Kelly's notes. 
 You know what, actually, I was thinking we should probably leave that alone. 
 Why? 
 Just, what difference would it make, you know? 
 That's what Father Esparza said. 
 He said I was grasping at straws. 
 Okay, but then, Amani, then I saw something. 
 What? What was it? 
 [Sighs] You're gonna think I'm insane. 
 [Chuckles] I wouldn't be too sure. 
 I've heard a lot recently. 
 [Sighs] 
 I think Kelly is trying to tell me something. 
 I think she is trying to communicate with me or send me a message or something. 
 [Horns honking] 
 [Shutter clicks] 
 [Sighs] 
 [Camera shutter clicks] 
 
 
 
 John : How in the hell could you allow something like this to happen, Ann? 
 An assassin strolls right up to him on the street. 
 Who was it? 
 I'm working on it. 
 Unacceptable. 
 To me too. We think he was acting alone. 
 This man had one of the Knives of Megiddo. 
 No. 
 How could you just leave Thorn out there? 
 Why didn't you bring him in? 
 Oh. 
 You could have done that yourself. 
 If you were face to face with him, why didn't you just... throw a net over his head? 
 And why didn't you bring this to my attention immediately? 
 John, stop worrying. 
 We've been thinking it's time for a change. 
 Things  have  changed. 
 Then he is ready. 
 Not exactly. 
 You know he has to accept his role, embrace it. 
 I'm not certain that's in the cards. 
 From everything we know about the boy... 
 He's 30. 
 He's a kid that doesn't know his ass from his elbow. 
 Turn him over. 
 We can't put a gun to his head and just say, "Bring about the apocalypse." 
 There are very mysterious forces at work. 
 [Chuckles] I brought you in. 
 Remember, Ann? 
 Oh, I do, John. 
 But I know Damien better than anyone. 
 You're too close, sloppy. 
 He knows about the hospital in Rome. 
 We can't leave him out there. 
 If someone else attempts another assassination... 
 That's always been the risk. 
 Do you know how much blood I've spilled keeping him safe? 
 Troy will take over. 
 Troy? 
 It's the next phase. 
 Of whose plan? 
 No offense, Troy, but you're a moron. 
 Is that so? 
 Then tell us about the woman in Damascus. 
 She attacked the Deliverer, she quoted Holly Liston, the year five suicide, and then she spoke in Latin. 
 "My beloved son with whom I am well pleased." 
 Who? What was she? 
 Oh, don't pretend you have the answers, either. 
 Or that you'd last five minutes face to face with the Deliverer, who's also the Destroyer. 
 This Damascus woman is the sign we've been waiting for. 
 Your coddling may have been the answer in the past, but you're in way over your head. 
 Don't do this, John. 
 There's no telling what could happen if you try to force things. 
 Are you threatening me? 
 You're done. 
 ♪♪ 
 [Sighs] 
 [Horns honking] 
 Ann : Where is he? 
 Waiting right outside Armitage... with a camera and a laptop. 
 Seems like he's doing his homework. 
 [Chuckles] He's running surveillance on me. 
 Looks like it. 
 Don't let him out of your sight. 
 Troy... 
 Ann... 
 I want you to know I had nothing to do with John's decision. 
 I was just as surprised as you were. 
 I'm sure. 
 John's emotional. We all are. 
 But we need to clear our heads to make sure this doesn't get screwed up. 
 Of course. 
 There's certain things you need to know about. 
 We... we can't talk here. 
 Meet me downstairs... outside. 
 [Cellphone rings] 
 Hello? 
 Andrha, hey. Thanks for getting back to me. 
 Yeah, great. 
 Did you find out about those daggers? 
 All right, okay. 
 That's it, yeah. 
 It's one of seven. It was excavated by a... 
 Carl Bugenhagen decades ago. 
 Is there still one of them in that museum in Amman? 
 How does something like that just go missing? 
 [Sighs] 
 [Shutter clicking] 
 I've dedicated my life to our cause. 
 You have been an inspiration. 
 I raised him like he was my own child. 
 Do you have children? 
 A daughter. 
 [Sighs] So you understand. 
 [Shutter clicking] 
 What are you gonna do with him? 
 What you do with a wild animal... 
 I'm gonna break him. 
 Be careful. 
 I appreciate your concern, but I'm not the one who should be afraid. 
 People are going to try to get to Damien through you. 
 Try to bribe you, threaten you. 
 You need to be strong. 
 I will. 
 Hold him close, but not too close. 
 He'll use that. 
 How? 
 [Shutter clicking] 
 He has certain needs... 
 Blood, death. 
 He's a war photographer because he feeds off the pain. 
 And women... young girls, very young. 
 Like your daughter. 
 She sucked him dry. 
 [Screams] Don't hurt me! 
 Help! 
 Ohh! Help! 
 You're crazy. I didn't even touch you! 
 Help! 
 He's coming. 
 He's coming for you. 
 [Ominous music plays] 
 Stop him! 
 [Car horn blares] 
 Help! 
 Help! 
 You okay? 
 Oh, Damien, get out of here! 
 He'll come back. 
 Who was he? 
 He wants to kill you. Please, just get out of here. 
 Don't! 
 Damien : Hey! 
 Man : What are you doing? 
 [Ominous music continues] 
 Wait!

 [Grunting] 
 [Screaming] 
 [Sobs] Thank you. 
 Looks like he's gonna be okay. 
 You look after your mom, okay? 
 Man : Bravo, buddy. 
 [Applause] 
 Man 2 : Well done, well done. 
 Man 3 :  Attention, due to an emergency, platform "B" is now closed. 
 Woman : Ladies and gentlemen, keep moving, please. 
 All other platforms remain open. 
 [Chatter] 
 Man 4 : I have to get approval. It's gonna be a minute. 
 Woman : Nice, orderly fashion. 
 Keep right, please. 
 This lane is closed right now. Take the stairs. 
 [Ominous music plays] 
 [Woman sobbing] 
 Ann : What is it? 
 It's Mr. Hendrie. 
 Is he all right? 
 He's been killed. 
 [Sobbing] 
 [Siren wails in distance] 
 We didn't have any champagne, so this will have to do. 
 Damien Thorn... hero of the day. 
 What's wrong? 
 "What's wrong?" 
 Uh, a man was torn apart today and died. 
 Yeah. And someone else didn't die... the kid you saved. 
 Take the win. 
 It seems wherever I go, death follows. 
 This is New York, bro. 
 There's 20 million people. 
 I'm sure some guy in the Bronx had a heart attack. 
 Is that supposed to be your fault, too? 
 You know what I mean. 
 Look, you tried to save Kelly. 
 Same thing goes for that guy who got hit by the cab. 
 And if you had the chance, you would have tried to save the guy at the escalator. 
 That's who you are. 
 But you can't save everyone. 
 You're not God. 
 All right. 
 Why don't you try to get some sleep and I'll call you in the morning. 
 All right. 
 [Phone ringing in distance] 
 [Object slams] 
 Looks like you've been barking up the wrong tree. 
 Your boy Thorn is a regular Eagle Scout. 
 He rescued a kid off the tracks? 
 Yeah, just as the subway was rolling in... a real hero. 
 It says here there was another death. 
 Unrelated accident. 
 Some guy bought it in another part of the station. 
 Come on, shut this down. Time to get some sleep. 
 Let's go. 
 Get a life.

 Ann : It's such an amazing shot. 
 If you'd had the temerity to publish it, maybe the U.N. would have sent in its Peacekeepers months earlier. 
 A photo like this could have saved thousands of lives. 
 No. 
 There was nothing anyone could have done. 
 You really believe that? 
 It's true. I mean, we... we knew they were coming. 
 The warlords and militia swept through the back country that whole summer. 
 With the rains, the river was flooded. 
 The village was cut off. 
 You got in.

 [Paper rustles] 
 The night they came through, the villagers ran into the fields. 
 Uh... 
 The guerrillas chased them. 
 Hacked down the tall grass, the bodies... with machetes. 
 Those who didn't run were rounded up, slaughtered. 
 I was in the field. 
 No one saw me. 
 One woman was in labor. She couldn't run. 
 They dragged her husband into the square. 
 And the warlords waited with this man while his wife gave birth... and she was screaming... for hours. 
 [  Woman screams ] 
 The fields were filled with the screams of the dying. 
 The militia, they just stood there, smoking, laughing at her screams. 
 The flames burned higher. 
 When that baby's head was finally showing...

 ...they ripped it out of her... and threw it on the fire. 
 Its first breath was a scream. 
 After that... they killed them all.

 I blame you for those deaths. 
 The evil you felt that night... that you always feel... that you keep running away from, it comes from inside of you. 
 It's what kept you alive when that man attacked you. 
 It's what kept you alive today. 
 Bullshit! 
 You just want me to buy this whole... 
 Antichrist head game of yours. 
 What's your explanation? 
 You're just like that baby... born in the fire. 
 There  was  evil there that night, but... 
 I had nothing to do with it. 
 It was those men who ripped that baby from its mother.
