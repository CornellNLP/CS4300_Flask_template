 This will certainly make me think twice about wearing my necktie again. 
 How did you get this? 
 Ann Rutledge left it in my bathroom. 
 I thought I warned you about her. 
 I made a mistake. I dropped my guard. 
 She used me. 
 Used you? How? 
 To kill Troy Hendrie. 
 Are you saying you're somehow responsible for his death? 
 It's complicated. 
 Son, I know we've lost touch through the years, but even I can see you're a mess. 
 Why? What's troubling you? 
 You'll think that it's crazy, that... that I'm crazy. 
 Nothing surprises me anymore. What exactly did Ann tell you? 
 I'm the Antichrist prophesied in the Book of Revelation. 
 [Laughing] 
 I'm not making this up. 
 I know Ann is... challenging, to say the least, but this takes batshit crazy to a whole other level. 
 Forget about her. I'm worried about you. 
 You need some help. Please see someone. 
 Lean on me all you want. 
 And whatever you do, stay far away from that woman.

 I just wanted to come by, check on you, make sure you're all right. 
 [Door closes] 
 I'm fine. 
 Good. 
 I heard about the thing in the subway last night. 
 It's a good thing you weren't killed. 
 It looks like I should be asking about you. 
 Yeah, do you know, there  was  someone killed in the subway, though. 
 Yeah, and he heard about that after he pulled the kid off the train tracks. 
 Saved his life. 
 Who are you? 
 A friend. 
 Do you have a name? 
 What can I do for you, Detective? 
 Well, I got a whole bunch of questions about the, uh, taxicab incident that you were involved with. 
 And I have some information about your assailant. 
 I thought maybe you could come down to the station, we could talk about it. 
 Shouldn't take too long. 
 Whatever I can do to help. 
 I'll catch up with you later. 
 Amani : Sure thing. 
 You got some big balls, pulling that kid off the tracks like that. 
 I just did what anyone else would've. 
 Yeah, well... 
 [Coins jangle] 
 ...most people, they'd like to think they'd be the hero. 
 But in that moment of truth, they're more concerned about saving their own skin. 
 It's a shame about that other guy, though. 
 [Coin clinks] 
 What happened? 
 Well, some guy got his tie stuck in the escalator. 
 Couldn't yank it free. 
 [Coin clinks] 
 Pulled his face right into the machinery. 
 Ripped it wide open. 
 [Coin clinks] 
 You want anything? Corn chips? Twizzlers? 
 Mm. 
 [Beeps] 
 [Whirring] 
 [Flap thuds] 
 Yeah, broke his teeth... 
 [Plastic bag crinkling] 
 ...chewed off his nose... 
 [Sighs] ...severed his carotid artery. 
 Blood everywhere. It was a mess. 
 You know... it was right about that time you saved that kid. 
 I saw some of the commotion. 
 Mm. 
 How'd you know him? 
 Who? 
 Escalator guy. 
 I didn't know him. 
 Troy Hendrie. Wall Street player. 
 Armitage Global. Mm? 
 I pulled the security tapes in the subway station. 
 It was pretty clear you were chasing him. 
 I was just running to catch the train. 
 Oh, yeah? What train? Where were you going? 
 I'd really like to help you, but I just don't know anything. 
 See, here's what I'm struggling with. 
 In the last few days, you've been in very close proximity to a few, uh... oh, I don't know, what do I call 'em? 
 Unexplained deaths? 
 Four, to be exact. 
 And that's a shitload of wrong place, wrong time. 
 So... why don't you sit down? 
 We have a lot to talk about. 
 I'm not going to mince words. 
 There's a void here today. 
 We all feel it. 
 We're all stunned and confused. 
 In all that confusion, let's not forget about what's really important... 
 Troy, and all that he gave. 
 Ann? Would you like to say a few words? 
 Um... 
 John and I have, um, been around the block a few times. 
 We're at that age where we're losing some of our dearest friends, people we've known all our lives. 
 But so many of you are so young. 
 I can tell by looking around this room that this is the first tragic death you've faced. 
 I remember when I was told that my husband and daughter were killed. 
 I was... I was 20. 
 My whole world fell down. 
 The only thing that got me through that... was people reaching out. 
 That's the only way we get through times like these. 
 Compassion heals... all suffering. 
 You never fail to surprise me. 
 We've seen a lot of people come and go over the years. 
 Nature of the beast. 
 Pardon the pun. 
 But you and I are still here. 
 Perhaps we'll be the last ones standing. 
 Damien said you left this in his apartment. 
 I had nothing to do with that. 
 Things are reaching a critical point. 
 We can't afford to fall into separate camps. 
 Perhaps we should get used to sharing the stage. 
 What are you proposing? 
 You've got Damien. 
 I have everything else in place. 
 We need to work together, not against each other. 
 We need to trust each other. 
 I couldn't agree more.

 He swerved to avoid a wild dog.

 There's no question about that. 
 But we do have some concerns about him professionally. 
 Is this because he didn't show up to the interview?

 The woman he loves dies a horrible death, is literally ripped from his hands, and you think he should've made this his priority? 
 Two days after Kelly dies, he risks his own life to save a stranger's kid from the train tracks, and you're saying he's not a reliable guy? 
 Mr. Golkar... 
 Damien Thorn is the best photographer out there, hands down. 
 But he's also the most selfless, courageous guy I've ever met. 
 And if these aren't the qualities you want in your collective, then good luck to you.

 Mr. Thorn's down at the police station right now. 
 We brought him in for questioning about his possible involvement in the death of Troy Hendrie. 
 Mr. Thorn suggested that you might've known him. 
 Yes. He worked with me at Armitage. 
 Hmm. 
 Ms. Rutledge, are you Mr. Thorn's attorney? 
 Yes. 
 He says you're not. 
 He says he only met you a week ago, and he suggested that you might be stalking him. 
 [Scoffs] He said that? 
 Well, to be specific, I'm not his personal attorney. 
 I represent the Thorn Family Estate. 
 Hmm. 
 He said there was a special room in your house, with, uh, his personal belongings from when he was a child? 
 Now that's ridiculous.

 Ann : I've known him his entire life. 
 Besides handling the legal affairs of the Thorn Estate, I'm also executor of his father's will. 
 Then why would Damien claim to only have met you last week? 
 He spent years overseas in extremely high pressure situations. 
 That's certainly taken a psychic toll. 
 Could you be more specific? 
 The specifics of his mental health... 
 [Pours liquid] 
 ...are attorney-client privilege. 
 But you have to understand, if there's a hell on earth, Damien's been dead center, photographing it. 
 Mm. 
 Does he own dogs? 
 I don't think so. 
 'Cause I was attacked by one last night. 
 Another man was mauled to death by a pack of them. 
 [Chuckles] Damien training dogs to attack people? 
 You give him too much credit. 
 I will say he used to, uh, be prone to fits of rage. 
 He supposedly knocked his mother over a balcony when he was young. 
 I assumed it was an accident. 
 But then I was on the board of one of the school he attended, and there was an altercation with another student. 
 I can't remember his name. 
 Thorn hurt him?

 So he rang his bell pretty bad? 
 Charles Powell. That's the name.
