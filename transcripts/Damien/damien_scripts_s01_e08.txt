 Previously on "Damien"... 
 We have a lot to process. You took a lethal dose of morphine. 
 It's impossible for a person to survive that, and yet, here you are. 
 Your release is predicated on daily sessions in order to monitor your progress. 
 Tell me about Damien Thorn. 
 You know who you should talk to? Charles Powell. 
 Powell thought Thorn was the Second Coming. 
 Charles? 
 How the hell are you, Cray? 
 You should have kept your bloody mouth shut. 
 Simone, I got to go. 
 No matter what happens, take care of yourself. 
 Damien, are you okay? Hello? 
 (DOOR SLAMS) 
 Know any good bars around here? 
 Take me to your place. We'll break in if we have to. 
 I'm down with that. 
 I have sought you out for a reason. 
 Will you help me? 
 There are seven of them. If each are placed correctly, your spirit and life will cease to exist.

 Did you find it? 
 (GASPS) 
 You scared the crap out of me. 
 Look at this. 
 Is that it? 
 In nomine Patris, et Filii, et Spiritus Sancti.

 (CLOCK TICKING) 
 Dr. Matthews : Let's talk some more about the PTSD. 
 Is that the official diagnosis? 
 Your symptoms track with the diagnosis. 
 Flashbacks, the hallucinations... insomnia, night sweats... paranoia. 
 To be honest, I just feel like a dick. 
 I've seen so many other people suffer. 
 I've grown up with money. I have a job I love. 
 Just feels like whining. 
 Survivor's guilt is another part of this. 
 All of these symptoms are manageable with proper medication. 
 Yeah? What about the Antichrist thing? You got a pill for that? 
 How do you plan on managing that? 
 Question is, how do  you  plan on managing that? 
 For the sake of argument, let's put the PTSD diagnosis aside... and examine this. 
 Let's just say you're meant to be the Antichrist. 
 What exactly does that mean to you? 
 It means I'm gonna do horrible things... 
 Be responsible for... pain and chaos and destruction. 
 Would that make you feel fulfilled? 
 Of course not. 
 Then don't do it. 
 (SCOFFS) I don't have a choice. 
 Everyone  has a choice. 
 Sartre says we are our choices, that even failing to choose is still a choice. 
 You picked up "Nausea" before. Was that an accident or a choice? 
 So this is just good, old-fashioned, existential crisis, is that it? 
 Some people find choice to be a burden. 
 They want their path to be laid out for them. 
 Personal responsibility... It's a blessing and a curse. 
 It leaves us with no one to blame but ourselves. 
 Truth is, you have already been making choices. 
 Can we agree that those choices have not been working for you so far? 
 I spoke to the vic earlier that day. 
 I was running some leads on, uh, Damien Thorn's case. 
 I also spoke to a Charles Powell. 
 The two of them went to school with Thorn. 
 We have video of Powell following Marquand into the club. 
 Seems he, uh, was going after him for some reason. 
 'Cause you tipped him off. 
 Powell's in the wind. He runs a flower shop. 
 We've got a unit sitting on it right now. 
 Mess. 
 Powell cut out his tongue? 
 Yeah. I think he took it as a souvenir. 
 So you're telling me your guy Thorn didn't kill this one, either? 
 Find Powell. 
 Wrap this sh1t up. 
 (KNOCK ON DOOR) 
 You should lock your door. There's a bad element in this neighborhood. 
 You can't just come in here. 
 I won't take long. 
 Whatever you need, I can't help you. I've been pretty busy lately, so... 
 I didn't know people still used film. 
 Thought all that stuff was digital now. 
 It's an old roll. I just found it. 
 I hear you had a trip to the hospital last week. 
 Well, I'm fine now. Thanks for asking. 
 What was that? 
 Patient confidentiality. They wouldn't tell me anything. 
 It was personal. 
 Speaking of personal... 
 Ran into an old buddy of yours the other night. 
 Is that Cray Marquand? 
 Somebody cut out his tongue. 
 You don't think  I  did this, do you? 
 People drop dead around you, and you... you just never get any blood on your hands. 
 I was in the hospital. 
 Anyone bring you flowers? 
 What? 
 Charles Powell. 
 He's a florist in New York. 
 Right? 
 I wouldn't know. I haven't talked to him since school. 
 Powell's missing. 
 What does that have to do with me? 
 Why'd you try to kill yourself? 
 Got a guilty conscience? 
 Friendships from the past coming back here to haunt you? 
 Mm. 
 If Powell tries to contact you, you call me... Immediately. 
 You can keep those. 
 Add them to your collection. 
 (DISPOSAL GRINDING) 
 Amani : Appreciate this, by the way. 
 You're lucky our cameras have an angle on your friend's apartment. 
 Yeah, if I can just see the guy who broke into his apartment. 
 What'd he take? 
 I don't know, man. 
 I was just, uh, told the place got trashed. 
 Yeah? 
 Your friend must have pissed someone off. 
 Yeah. Seems like it. 
 Whoa. Hold that? 
 Can you zoom in on her? 
 What, you know her? 
 Yeah. 
 Here you go. 
 Uh... enjoy the game. 
 Yeah. Thanks. 
 Ms. Rutledge. 
 What can I do for you today? 
 I need a favor. 
 Of course. 
 I need you to destroy this. 
 Unusual details. 
 Family heirloom? 
 Not  my  family. 
 Anything for you. 
 I'm sorry, ma'am. 
 I've never seen anything like it. 
 Amani : You should've called me sooner. 
 How do you know we can trust her? 
 She's a nun. 
 The Vatican sent her here to investigate what's going on. 
 I think she can make sense of things. 
 Do you know who this woman is? 
 No. Damien first saw her in Damascus. 
 It really rattled him. 
 And then we got back and... 
 Kelly... 
 Yeah. 
 And then this woman shows up... Ann Rutledge. 
 She came out of nowhere. 
 Says she's been with him since he was a kid. 
 Has a shrine of all his stuff, like some kind of crazed stalker. 
 Ann Rutledge of Armitage? 
 Yeah, he's convinced that she's the head of the same conspiracy around him. 
 She's claiming that she's been his guardian since the White House. 
 So she really could be his benefactor. 
 The Vatican was expecting a  man. 
 We assumed there was someone looking out for him the past 25 years. 
 Rutledge could be the person we've been looking for. 
 Simone says you think there's another person involved? 
 Yeah. Uh, her name's Veronica. 
 She works at the Collodion Collective. 
 I saw security footage of her going into Damien's place. 
 What's her job for the Collective? 
 I don't know. 
 What do you mean? And then how did you know her? 
 We're, uh... we're sleeping together. 
 Oh. 
 Does she know you saw this footage of her? 
 No. 
 You have to go back to her... 
 Find out who she's working for. 
 Yeah, fine. I'll do whatever. 
 Just stop this craziness. 
 (ENGINE TURNS OVER) 
 (ENGINE TURNS OVER) 
 (ENGINE CLUNKS, SHUTS OFF) 
 (GROANS) Damn it! 
 Ah, you're kidding me. 
 (ENGINE SPUTTERS) 
 (AIR HISSING) 
 (GRUNTING) 
 (ENGINE SHUTS OFF) 
 (SIGHS) 
 I knew you'd come. 
 Did you like my gift? 
 (CHUCKLES) 
 We used to cut classes and come here, you know? 
 No one would know where we were... 
 You killed Cray. Why? 
 Why would you do something like that? 
 He spoke to that detective about you. 
 About  us. 
 And I got your messages. 
 What are you talking about? 
 From that detective. 
 He told me all about those people you killed. 
 I didn't kill anyone, Charles. 
 You don't have to lie to me. 
 In school, we were... We were always honest. 
 We were such good friends. 
 Yeah, we were. 
 I bought you your first good camera. 
 Who'd have thought you'd go this far? 
 Me. 
 (SIGHS) 
 I told everybody. I-I always believed in you. 
 Even after you set me on fire. 
 That was an accident... A stupid prank gone wrong. 
 I didn't choose to put that fluid on my hands. 
 You forced me. 
 The others were taunting. I turned to you for help, but you just went along with it. 
 I was 15. 
 I'm sorry. 
 That's what I thought. You didn't mean it. 
 But you never came to visit. 
 And I lay in that hospital bed for months, and you... 
 I never heard from you. 
 I heard you left the school. 
 Why did you do it? 
 What was it? 
 I needed you to stick up for me. 
 The others would have listened to you. The others were scared of you. 
 But you treated me like I was just some little piece of... 
 You kept pushing me! 
 Always following me around, never leaving me alone. 
 I warned you you would get hurt. 
 I told you to stop. 
 Because we're connected... Bonded. 
 And that's why I killed Cray... 
 For you. 
 No, no, no. That... That's on you, not me. 
 I never asked for that. 
 Of course you did. 
 Just like you did all the others. 
 What others? 
 What others, Charles? 
 Nobodies. 
 No one even knows they're missing. 
 I did it all for you. 
 So... who should we kill next? 
 (INHALES DEEPLY) 
 Aah! 
 (WHEEZES) 
 (PUNCHES LANDING) 
 
 
 
 (DOOR CLOSES) 
 James? 
 You're home. 
 Yeah. 
 I decided to call it a day. 
 You okay? You don't look good. 
 Did something happen? 
 I-I'm fine. 
 Whatcha drawing there? 
 Why would you draw something like this? 
 What made you think of a fire? 
 Patrick : Jacob, honey, go brush your teeth. 
 (SIGHS) 
 You were scaring him. 
 What... What is going on? 
 (SIGHS) 
 I don't know. 
 T-There's something not right with him ever since the pool incident. 
 Not right with  him? 
 What is that supposed to mean? 
 How are your appointments with Dr. Gellman? 
 Fine. 
 Really? 
 I ran into his old secretary at the post office. 
 He retired three months ago and moved to Florida. 
 (SIGHS) Okay, look... 
 (CELLPHONE VIBRATING) 
 I've been slammed with work. 
 Are you kidding me? 
 This can't wait. 
 Do not walk out on me right now. 
 We need to talk about this. 
 (ENGINE SHUTS OFF) 
 Put your hands behind your back... now. 
 (GRUNTS) 
 (GROANS) 
 I knew he'd never kill me. 
 I'm the only one who understands him. 
 (LAUGHS) 
 Who did this?! 
 The devil. 
 The devil did this. 
 (LAUGHS) 
 Damien : I almost killed someone tonight. 
 Why didn't you? 
 I-I stopped myself. I made that choice. 
 I-I didn't want to be that person. 
 Who is this person you almost killed? 
 This... This... 
 This sick freak named Charles Powell. 
 He's... He's been killing people in my name. 
 He got it into his head that I wanted him to. 
 Where is he now? 
 I assume jail. 
 I mean, if... if anyone deserves to die, it's him. 
 He's been killing people... For me. 
 And... And I... Tonight, I could j... 
 I could just feel what it would be like just... just to wipe him out of existence... 
 To take this one bit of evil in the world. 
 Wouldn't that make... 
 Wouldn't that make the world a better place? 
 Just to have him gone! 
 You know, is... is... Is that not our responsibility? 
 You know, when we... When we encounter evil, shouldn't we destroy it? 
 (BREATHING HEAVILY) 
 Is that your call to make? 
 No. No, I'm not... I'm not a murderer. I never will be. 
 But how do I know... how do I know I made the right choice? 
 How do I know that it wasn't the evil part of me that let this monster live? 
 You said I get to choose, right? 
 Yeah. 
 All right, so how do I know when it's... When it's the good side of me or... or the evil side that's doing the choosing? 
 The fact that you are struggling means you're human. 
 You fear the devil inside, but... you letting Charles Powell live... 
 That's proof that you've still got the upper hand. 
 (BREATHING HEAVILY) 
 Hey. 
 Come here. What's wrong? 
 Remember when we, uh, broke into my apartment the other night? 
 You break into a lot of places, don't you? 
 No, sir. 
 Mama raised me to be a "one break-in at a time" kind of girl. 
 How  is  your mother, by the way? 
 I'd like to meet her. 
 It'd be quite an honor meeting Ann Rutledge. 
 Listen to me, Amani. It's not what you think. 
 You used me to get to my friend. 
 What do you want with him? 
 It's not me. It's my mother. 
 Stay the hell away from him. 
 I haven't gone near him. 
 You were in his place. 
 I was trying to fix it. 
 Fix what? 
 My mom had them trash his place. Okay? 
 She was pissed he was driving her away, and she wanted him to think someone was after him so she could swoop in to protect him. 
 She's both the arsonist and the fireman. 
 After she heard he tried to kill himself, she had me clean it up. 
 Look, I don't know what you people want, but I'm warning you... 
 If you touch him, I will kill you. 
 You have to believe me. 
 Okay? 
 Yes, I was supposed to run surveillance, but this... us... It's real. 
 You've been lying to me from the second we met. 
 I'm not playing you, Amani. 
 I'm not. 
 I  was,  but I am not now. 
 Listen. 
 Why don't you go back to your mother... and Lyons and this nun and whoever else... and you tell them this is over. 
 You understand me? 
 It's over. 
 Amani Golkar knows I'm your daughter. 
 Then Damien knows, too. 
 One step forward, two steps back. 
 Well, on our list of problems, that's pretty far down. 
 He... also mentioned a nun. 
 He didn't say more. 
 Find out who she is. 
 And no more carelessness. 
 (DOOR OPENS) 
 Simone : Armitage is a huge corporation. 
 Didn't the Vatican think that the Antichrist would be backed or supported by something like that? 
 How could they miss that? 
 Hubris. 
 The Vatican has watched nations rise and fall from its ivory towers. 
 It never feels threatened... Not even now. 
 And they did send you here, right? 
 Yes. 
 There are those who think it's a fool's errand. 
 There are others who fear I'm too late. 
 If that's true, then why are you alone? 
 If Damien is who you think he is, then shouldn't there be an army of priests here? 
 The Vatican doesn't fight wars. 
 It handles things quietly. 
 Are you an assassin? 
 I am a pilgrim... here seeking the truth. 
 I have to look closer at Rutledge and Lyons. 
 I'll call you tomorrow. 
 Be safe. 
 (CREAK) 
 (BREATHING SHAKILY) 
 (SIGHING) Oh! 
 Greta, listen. I... 
 (BOTH GRUNTING) 
 (GUNSHOT) 
 (GASPS) 
 (GUN THUDS) 
 (EXHALES SHARPLY) 
 (BREATHING HEAVILY) 
 Dude, before you slam the door in my face, just hear me out. 
 Look, you were right... About everything. 
 I  was  in on it. 
 Only, I didn't know it. 
 I met this chick at the Collective. 
 We hooked up. 
 She's Ann Rutledge's daughter. 
 All right? I just found out. 
 I'm sorry. 
 No. 
 I  am. 
 For getting you into all this. 
 Things made more sense in the field, huh. 
 (CHUCKLING) Yeah. 
 Whatever's going on, man, I'm with you. 
 Till the very end. 
 I'm gonna have a beer. 
 You want one? 
 (POLICE RADIO CHATTER) 
 Hello, Charles. 
 My name is Dr. Matthews. 
 I'm here to have a little chat with you. 
 Who are you? 
 You're not my lawyer. 
 I'm a friend of Damien's. 
 Is he here? 
 No. 
 He told me he wishes you were dead. 
 Bobby. You set up my guy in the, uh, interview room? 
 Yep. Good to go. Oh, his, uh, doctor's in with him. 
 What doctor? 
 The shrink. 
 She was called for a psych eval. 
 She said you knew about it. 
 Damien didn't mean to hurt me. 
 Oh, but he did. 
 Damien didn't want Cray Marquand dead. 
 He wanted  you  dead. 
 What? 
 You failed him, Charles. 
 (PEN CLICKING) 
 He called you a "sick freak." 
 (CLICKING CONTINUES) 
 I don't believe you. 
 Damien loves me. 
 How could he love you? 
 (CLICKING CONTINUES) 
 You're not a true servant. You're a liar. 
 Guard! 
 You're not worthy, Charles. 
 Guard! Get me out of here! 
 You are nothing! 
 Man : Shots fired! Down the hall! 
 (INDISTINCT SHOUTING)
