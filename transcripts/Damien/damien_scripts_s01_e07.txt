 Previously on "Damien"... 
 People who come after me, they don't fare so well. 
 You've seen enough to know. 
 (SNARLING) 
 You're looking for answers that are not there. 
 I'm not crazy. 
 This beast is not an inventor. 
 Rome's hubris has allowed him to age in the shadows. 
 30 years. 
 Damien : Good to see you, Cray. I could use a favor. 
 Us Preston Hall brothers have to stick together, right? 
 What exactly did Ann tell you? 
 I'm the Antichrist. 
 (LAUGHING) 
 We can't afford to fall into separate camps. 
 We should get used to sharing the stage. 
 I have someone who needs a bit of housekeeping. 
 (GLASS SHATTERS) 
 You think Damien has something to with Kelly's death, don't you? 
 He needs our help. Not our suspicion. 
 I'm so sorry. 
 I pushed you too hard. 
 Get. Out. 
 Bless you, my son. 
 Come to me, you poor sinner. 
 (ECHOING) Accept me. 
 Woman : Mr. Jaspers, you forgot to put pants on again. 
 How are you feeling, Mr. Thorn? 
 I'm in a mental hospital. 
 (ECHOING) No, you're in a regular hospital. 
 (NORMAL VOICE) Just in a psychiatric wing. 
 Temporarily. 
 Does that mean I'm getting out of here? 
 Dr. Matthews will be here soon. 
 She'll be able to answer that. 
 Answer that. 
 (ECHOING) Psychiatric wing. 
 (NORMAL VOICE) Why don't you go and get something to eat? 
 (ECHOING) Go and get something to eat? 
 Orderly Jameson... 
 (INDISTINCT CHATTER) 
 No, no, Mr. Williams. You don't want... 
 (WOMAN SHOUTS) 
 (GRUNTING) 
 Betty! (MUMBLING) 
 Woman : Are you done with this? You have to go back... 
 Shush! 
 (GIGGLES) 
 Man : Touching, touching! Touching! 
 Woman : No touching. 
 Touching! 
 (INDISTINCT CHATTER) 
 All right. Manuel, can you help me down here? 
 (INDISTINCT SHOUTING) 
 You should move him in. 
 Woman : All right. 
 (SCREAMING) 
 (INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS) 
 (P.A. SYSTEM BEEPS) 
 (NORMAL VOICE) Hello again. 
 Shall we pray? 
 No, thanks. 
 Father, it's me again. 
 Oh, get a load of this asshole. 
 He thinks he's Jesus. 
 I'm the one, true risen Christ. 
 Heavenly Father, let the lambs lie with the wolves. 
 Heavenly Father, let the lambs lie with the wolves. 
 And bless the meek. 
 Bless the meek and the mild! 
 Out, Satan! 
 I have saved a thousand and raised Lazarus! 
 I have saved a thousand! 
 (LAUGHS) 
 (CROW CAWING) 
 Patrick! 
 I got him. I got him. 
 Jacob. 
 Jacob, please. Wake up.

 Oh, sh1t. (PANTING) 
 (INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS) 
 Woman : Your mandatory hold is over. 
 Your release is predicated on daily sessions in order to monitor your progress. 
 You have any reason to believe you won't be able to keep these appointments? 
 I'll do my best. 
 I have a lot of uncertainty in my life, but I'll... I'll do my best. 
 Well, I'll prescribe a mild course of Risperidone, and you and I will see each other tomorrow. 
 Is someone picking you up? 
 I'll, uh, take a cab. 
 Damien. 
 (P.A. SYSTEM BEEPS) 
 Damien. 
 You took a lethal dose of morphine. 
 Alcohol, carbon monoxide poisoning. 
 It's impossible for a person to survive that, and yet here you are. 
 That's a miracle. 
 I really hope you'll make the most of this second chance. 
 I won't try and kill myself if that's what you're worried about. 
 It wouldn't work, anyway. 
 You have gone through some harrowing experiences. 
 Take their toll on anyone. 
 We have a lot to process. 
 I just want you to know that I'm on your side. 
 I'm here for you, day or night. 
 I'll see you tomorrow. 
 Don't go. 
 You'll... you'll kill yourself. 
 (SCREAMING) 
 Please stop. 
 Let us be spared. 
 You'll lay waste to everything. 
 Mr. Jaspers! 
 Stop. 
 Let him go. Come on. Let him go. 
 Damien, I'm begging you. 
 Man : He's the deliverer. 
 Evil. 
 Don't let him go. Please! 
 Stop, please. I'm begging you! 
 Kill yourself. 
 Get back! 
 (SCREAMING) 
 Just stop yourself! No! 
 Get back! Now! 
 Get back now! 
 (ALL SCREAMING) 
 Forgive them, Father! 
 (OMINOUS MUSIC PLAYS) 
 (BIRDS CHIRPING) 
 (DISH RATTLES) 
 Patrick : (SIGHS) 
 The doctor said he could go back to school today. 
 We should keep an eye on him for another day or two. 
 A little extra vigilance can't hurt. 
 Accidents happen, James. We can't keep Jacob in a bubble. 
 This wasn't an accident. 
 There was something else in that pool. 
 Are you serious? 
 You didn't see what I saw. 
 Look, I know you don't want to hear this, but I want you to go back to Dr. Gellman. 
 (SCOFFS) 
 I was waiting for that. 
 You're not only distracted, you're obsessed. 
 Paranoid. 
 Delusional? 
 You need to talk to someone who's not me. 
 Someone objective. 
 You want the most logical explanation? 
 Here. 
 Just because I can't prove it doesn't mean I'm wrong. 
 Now, I ignored my gut in the past, you remember? 
 What you're saying makes no sense. 
 (DOOR CLOSES) 
 Hey, buddy. You hungry? 
 What is it, bud? 
 I'm looking for the dog. 
 Will he come back? 
 You saw a dog? 
 A big, black one by the pool. 
 I followed it outside. 
 Simone : Listen. I get why you're mad. 
 Amani : Yeah, you stole my keys. You lied to me. 
 No. 
 No, no. 
 No, this... everything was broken. 
 I was right there. I... 
 Yeah, well, you also saw a bleeding statue, so... 
 I know what I saw, Amani. 
 Damien is in danger, and I'm gonna warn him. 
 The last thing he needs right now is your paranoid rambling about a break-in that clearly never happened. 
 Who do you think you're talking to? 
 (DOOR OPENS) 
 Dude, what are you, uh... what are you doing here? 
 I was supposed to pick you up. 
 Why are you in my apartment? 
 I just wanted to stock your fridge to make sure you had everything you needed. 
 And you, you're just here to welcome me home? 
 Is that it? 
 Damien, no, listen. 
 There were two guys here. They trashed this place. They were after you. 
 How'd you get inside my apartment? 
 She stole my keys. 
 I was trying to get Kelly's notebook back... 
 What's that? 
 Is that a care package from Rutledge? 
 Did she want you to monitor my homecoming? Is that it? 
 Dude, hold on. 
 You know I don't know that woman. 
 You're in on it. 
 Are you, um... are you all right, man? 
 I mean, should I, uh, call someone? 
 Stop acting like you don't know what I'm talking about. 
 No, I  don't  know what you're talking about. 
 Rutledge, Lyons, this. 
 Is... is that a... 
 Simone : Oh, my God. 
 Is that a tattoo? 
 What the hell is that? 
 Damien, you said those 6's meant nothing to you. 
 You told me I was imagining... 
 Hey, don't you accuse me of anything. 
 You broke into my place, and you...  you ... after everything. 
 Get out, both of you. 
 Look, man. I'm sorry, all right? 
 I thought you just needed some time or an assignment t-to take your mind off things. 
 The night when you tried to, uh... you called me. 
 And I didn't pick up. 
 And that's killing me. 
 I'm sorry. I should have, uh... should have been there for you. 
 Get out. 
 (UTENSILS CLACKING) 
 Divine genius, bringer of light, keeper of knowledge, we are here to bring about your bidding. 
 Let the veil be torn asunder. 
 Woman : Sir? 
 Sir, you can't go back there. 
 Sir, you're not allowed. 
 My dear boy. 
 I need to talk to you immediately. 
 Of course. 
 Excuse me. 
 Well, you... you look like hell. 
 I attempted suicide, so... 
 I begged you to get some help. 
 Ah, no one can help me, and John, you know that. 
 See, since Damascus, I've been having these visions. 
 And when I was in that ambulance, I had a dream... more of a... more of an epiphany. 
 What did you see? 
 You're in bed with Ann Rutledge. 
 We sit on the same board. 
 I brought her into the White House. 
 I've told you. 
 No, it goes deeper than that. 
 You pull the strings, not her. 
 You're confu... 
 Do not lie to me, John. 
 (SCOFFS) 
 I'm the one that's been trying... 
 Damien! I love you. 
 I've been awaiting to serve. 
 The serpent's tongue is forked. 
 What did you say? 
 He lays low in the grass, farthest from Heaven's bright light and Hell's cold fire. 
 I love him! 
 Damien, I serve you, my master. 
 I serve you, my master! Damien! 
 (SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYS) 
 
 
 
 (DOORBELL JINGLES) 
 Red roses mean "I love you," and orange means passion. 
 White? 
 Purity. New beginnings. 
 Would you like a dozen? 
 I'm looking for Charles Powell. 
 I'm Charles. 
 Detective James Shay. 
 I'd like to talk to you about your old alma mater, Preston Hall. 
 You roomed with Damien Thorn. 
 We shared the same dorm. 
 Something happened to him? 
 Not to him. 
 I'm investigating a series of suspicious deaths. 
 What sort of deaths? 
 Well, they've been ruled accidents. 
 Seems you don't believe that. 
 I understand there was an incident at Preston Hall where Damien rang your bell pretty bad. 
 Enough to be hospitalized. 
 I'm sorry to disappoint you, Detective. 
 I don't know where you got your information. 
 You're sure about that? Damien never touched you? 
 Not a hair. 
 We had a few classes together. 
 He kept to himself. 
 I think he became a journalist or something like that. 
 (SIGHS) Good job for a loner. 
 Now, are you sure I can't get you an orchid to take home? 
 No, thank you. 
 I'd just kill it. 
 (BELL JINGLES) 
 Tara : You can have more time if you need it. 
 Simone : It's okay. 
 It's actually really nice to be back in the real world. 
 All right, then. 
 I have a smorgasbord of pop-culture weirdness for you right there. 
 Give me the most ridiculous, mind-numbing... 
 Mm, celebrity bridal fashion. 
 Is black the new white? 
 Perfect. I'll take it. 
 Good luck. 
 Great. 
 (MID-TEMPO POP MUSIC PLAYS) 
 Black, the new white. Give me a break. 
 (KEYBOARD CLACKS)

 (STATIC CRACKLES) 
 (OMINOUS MUSIC PLAYS) 
 (KEYBOARD CLACKS) 
 (TELEPHONE RINGING) 
 How's it going? 
 Oh, um... 
 (SIGHS) 
 You know, I-I think I should probably take this home and work on it. 
 Yeah. 
 Thanks. Sorry. 
 It's okay. 
 (SIGHS) 
 (LAPTOP LID THUDS) 
 Cray Marquand? 
 Detective Shay. Thanks for coming in. 
 Not like you gave me a choice. 
 What's this about a hit-and-run? 
 Tell me about Damien Thorn. 
 (TELEPHONE RINGS, INDISTINCT CHATTER) 
 What about him? 
 When was the last time you saw him? 
 Can't remember. 
 He didn't come to see you a few weeks ago? 
 He'd been deported from Syria. 
 Wanted my help getting a new visa. 
 And did you? 
 No. 
 Mm. You're smart to stay away from him. 
 I keep my distance. 
 Thorn will never know we spoke. 
 You know who you should talk to? Charles Powell. 
 Who's he? 
 Thorn's roommate, odd man out. 
 He's like a needy puppy, always lurking around. 
 Powell was obsessed with Thorn, maybe even in love with him. 
 These guys are gay? 
 More like hero worship. 
 Powell thought Thorn was the second coming. 
 I'm gonna need more than that. 
 (SIGHS) 
 There was an initiation for this secret club we had. 
 Skull and Bones secret? 
 We'd spray butane over our hands and then light them on fire. 
 The butane would always burn out quickly. 
 No one ever got hurt. 
 I'm not sure what he did, but Thorn pushed Powell to do it. 
 And then he just watched him burn. 
 Like he got off on it. 
 Poor kid suffered third-and fourth-degree burns over half his body. 
 You blame Thorn? 
 Weird stuff always happens around him, I can't explain. 
 (SIGHS) 
 I'll look up this Powell. Thanks for your time. 
 You promise Thorn will never know I was here, right? 
 I'll mind my tongue, you mind yours. 
 He came to me. 
 He knows I'm involved. 
 He was bound to sooner or later. 
 He doesn't trust me. 
 I lied to him. 
 Give him time. 
 It's a miracle he survived. 
 Further proof he's worth all our efforts. 
 (CROWS CAWING) 
 (OMINOUS MUSIC PLAYS) 
 (OBJECT RATTLING) 
 We need him feeling dependent on us, not isolated and vulnerable. 
 That's a very dangerous combination. 
 (DISHES RATTLE) 
 What do you want? 
 The Knife of Megiddo. 
 I know you have one. 
 I've known it for some time. 
 I need it for protection. 
 To perform the full ritual, you need all seven. 
 I'll take what I can get. 
 They're scattered all over the world. 
 You have one. 
 I hear the assassin Saroyan had one despite what you told me. 
 The Vatican has the rest. 
 They have four. 
 So, besides the one Saroyan lost, one other is missing. 
 Do you know which one? 
 Until the whole set's together, it's impossible to tell which dagger is which. 
 The one you have could be Ephesus, the blade that pierces the heart. 
 You'll never find out. 
 My obligation is to protect the Antichrist, not you. 
 There is no Antichrist without me. 
 (CHUCKLES) 
 You wish that were true. 
 I can't chance being on his bad side. 
 I'm surprised to see you panicking so early in the game. 
 He came to my house. 
 Margot hasn't spoken in years. 
 She fell under his power. 
 I won't risk her falling prey to him. 
 I'll talk to him on your behalf. 
 I would appreciate that, Ann. 
 What are old friends for? 
 What other lies does the serpent tell? 
 (OMINOUS CHANTING) 
 Hey. 
 (WEAKLY) Hi. 
 Is John the snake? 
 (NORMAL VOICE) Yes. 
 He tells untruths. 
 What are they? 
 That he loves his wife and sons. 
 He loves only the butcher's knife. 
 Does the serpent hail the Beast? 
 He slithers before the Beast. 
 So he's... he's part of the plan? 
 He makes way for the Beast. Is that right? 
 Yes. 
 Why? 
 What does the serpent want? 
 To wear one of the 10 diadems. 
 There will be 10 crowns for 10 horns. 
 The serpent wears but one. 
 So the serpent serves the Beast and is rewarded with a crown? 
 The beast will loose 10 men with 10 armies onto the world. 
 (INHALES RAGGEDLY) 
 Margot. 
 How can I stop it? 
 Hey. Hey, Margot. 
 Margot. 
 How can I stop it? 
 The Dark Church is ready. 
 What... what Dark Church?

 Excuse me. 
 I know you. 
 You're her. 
 You must have me mixed up with somebody else, honey. 
 (WINGS FLAPPING) 
 Who did you think you saw? 
 Are you following me? 
 We have a lot to talk about, Simone. 
 Not here. Come. 
 Come. Come. 
 Father Esparza says you claim to have witnessed something extraordinary. 
 Yes. He told me I was crazy. 
 (SCOFFS) He told me the same thing. 
 That doesn't mean I believe him. 
 My name is Sister Greta Fraueva. 
 I'm from a group called Scisco Dei. 
 What is that? 
 It's an office within the Vatican. 
 We investigate, uh, um, certain matters. 
 Miracles? 
 Mm, that's... that's part of it, yeah. 
 I believe you saw that statue bleed real blood, and I believe you've seen other things... 
 Things you doubt because of the rational parts of your brain or because you're surrounded by people of limited imagination. 
 I have sought you out because I not only believe you saw these things, you saw them for a reason. 
 (SIREN WAILS) 
 (DOOR OPENS) 
 Sorry, we're closing up. 
 Shay : I dug a little deeper into your relationship with Damien Thorn. 
 It seems that, uh, there was a lot more involved than you let on. 
 (SIGHS) 
 Are you protecting Damien because you're still in love with him? 
 Lots of kids get bullied in school. 
 This went above and beyond. 
 I did everything I could to get on his good side. 
 I wrote his papers, stole things for him from the other boys, gave him what little money I had, but nothing was ever enough. 
 Tell me about the fire. 
 I know all about their sick club. 
 He can't hurt you anymore. 
 Damien dared me...  forced  me into it. 
 Cray and the others grabbed my arms, held me tight, and doused my hands in butane. 
 Cray Marquand was there? 
 And what did Thorn do? 
 He lit the match and set fire to my hands. 
 Then he stood there and watched the flames. 
 At first, I didn't feel a thing. 
 I thought, "This will get him to leave me alone." 
 But the flames didn't die out. 
 They burst higher, turning a hotter, bluer white, and... the smell was awful. 
 Pain was unbearable. I started screaming. 
 And I woke up two weeks later in hospital. 
 I've been in and out ever since. 
 Don't tell him I told you, please. 
 It's in the past. 
 I'm gonna make him pay for what he did to you. 
 (DOOR OPENS) 
 (FIRE CRACKLING) 
 Margot? 
 Are you sleeping? 
 (BREATHING RAGGEDLY) 
 (OMINOUS MUSIC PLAYS) 
 (CRICKETS CHIRPING) 
 (PRAYING IN LATIN) 
 The things you've seen are not messages from your sister. 
 They started right after she died. 
 We believe they're signs of something greater, something we've ignored for decades. 
 This was Kelly's. 
 (GASPS) 
 Before Jesus, there were many who claimed to be the Messiah. 
 For thousands of years, it's been the same with the Antichrist. 
 We've been waiting. 
 But if this is true, then why now? 
 Damien's 30 years old. 
 Aren't you a little late to the party? 
 It may be too late. 
 There was an archaeologist, Carl Bugenhagen, who visited Thorn's father 25 years ago. 
 Bugenhagen wrote the Vatican saying that he and Thorn believed the young boy to be the Beast from Revelation. 
 That letter sat in the Vatican archives until I found it. 
 Perhaps Damien is a good man. 
 That would be easy to prove. 
 If so, that's the end of it. 
 But if he's not... 
 He doesn't want anything to do with this. 
 He tried to kill himself. 
 But he didn't die, which could mean the rest of us will. 
 You can't be serious. 
 I can't be wrong! 
 The truth is hidden. 
 I need to drag it out into the light no matter what. 
 Will you help me? 
 (OMINOUS MUSIC PLAYS) 
 (LAMB BLEATING) 
 Hear us. 
 Protect your faithful servants. 
 Hold back the Beast as we break the chains that begin your reign of a thousand years. 
 (LAMB BLEATS) 
 For this, we ask you receive this sacrifice. 
 (LAMB CRIES) 
 (LAMB SCREAMS) 
 (KNOCK ON DOOR) 
 You owe me an explanation. 
 You can't just ignore me. 
 You scared the hell out of Lyons today. 
 Damien : And he came running to you. 
 (DOOR CLOSES) 
 Are you his pet or is he yours? 
 He's a business partner... a very valuable one, at that. 
 He has a slaughterhouse on his property. 
 He's obsessed with blood and pain. 
 (CHUCKLES) You aren't? 
 He came to me for this. 
 There are seven of them. 
 Each to be used on a different point on your body. 
 If each are placed correctly, your spirit and life will cease to exist. 
 What good is one? 
 It would probably end your life. 
 Isn't that what you want? 
 The power wants what it wants. 
 It'll choose another. 
 We're all marching toward Golgotha. 
 Right now, you bear the cross. 
 So if I die, another takes my place. 
 Why would you give me the option? 
 I'm not like Lyons. 
 I dedicated my... self to you. 
 I'm here to serve. 
 If this is what you want. 
 (EXHALES DEEPLY) 
 (EXHALES SHARPLY) 
 (WATER RUNNING) 
 (WATER STOPS) 
 To serve is to honor. 
 Excuse me? 
 Don't tell me you forgot the school motto. 
 Charles? 
 In the flesh. 
 How the hell are you, Cray? 
 I'm fine. 
 And you? 
 Never better. 
 It's so funny us running into each other. 
 The police we're asking me about you today. 
 About me? 
 Well, actually, about Damien Thorn. 
 I told them I wanted nothing to do with him. 
 I said the same thing. 
 I swear we've both suffered enough. 
 I need to get going, but we should grab dinner sometime. 
 Sure. 
 Yeah. 
 (FAUCET SQUEAKS)

 You should have kept your bloody mouth shut.
