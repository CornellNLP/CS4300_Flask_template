 Okay, so it's day four. 
 It's actually day five. 
 Right. Sorry. And you're on your way to Fort Lauderdale... 
 No, he's meeting his sister-in-law outside Orlando to pick up the mysterious product he stole from work. 
 Right. 
 And your wife was taking your two kids, Jared and Delilah... 
 The boy's name is actually Jareb with a "B." 
 All right. Yes. I'm sorry. 
 And they were on their way home to Syracuse... 
 Because she was sick of his lies. 
 Sharon, please. They have a strong relationship. 
 She's not even his wife. They're not married. 
 That's because she's actually married to some guy named Carlos.

 Tell me about this guy. 
 What about Orlando? 
 Why didn't your sister-in-law meet you in Fort Lauderdale? 
 Because she's a coke-fueled sh1t show. 
 Yeah, but wait. You said she's clean and sober now, and on the road with a Christian rock band. 
 How'd that happen? 
 How the hell would he know? He wasn't there. 
 She could've taken a rideshare for all he knows. Who cares?
