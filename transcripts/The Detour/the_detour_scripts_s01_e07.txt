 Man : You don't seem to have a strong relationship with your wife. 
 Excuse me? 
 Our relationship is rock-solid. 
 You lied to her about getting fired. 
 You lied to her about the real reason you were going on vacation, which was to get your job back. 
 Do you tell your wife everything? 
 I do. 
 [Scoffs] Bullshit. 
 No, I can't get diapers, babe. 
 Because I am in the middle of a federal investigation with public enemy number one. 
 Because he left a trail of bodies about 6 miles long, that's why. 
 [Lowered voice] It's not you. I'm just joking. 
 [Normal voice] All right. Okay. I'll be home soon. 
 I love you. Bye. 
 [Touchscreen clicks] 
 I'm so sorry. Where were we? 
 He's lying to his wife. 
 Oh, that's bad. 
 I love my wife very much. 
 [Romantic music playing] 
 Hey, I'm Nate. 
 Hi, Nate. Nice to meet you. 
 [Both laugh] 
 I know this may be a little forward, but... 
 I would love to take you out. 
 Wow. 
 [Smacks] 
 Both : Ohh! [Laughing] 
 I'm getting you! 
 Aah! Stop, Nate!

 [Panting] I think I love you. 
 I do.

 [Sniffles] 
 And that is how we met. 
 That's not actually how you remember it, is it? 
 [Horns honking and blaring] 
 Everything I just said was true. 
 If you hadn't used our names, I wouldn't have recognized the story. 
 What are you talking about? 
 [Cellphone rings] 
 Who... who is this? 
 [Ring] 
 Hello? 
 Hello, Nathaniel. 
 Who is this? 
 It's Vanessa. 
 Who is it? 
 It's work. 
 I just wanna let you know that your very important package will be in Orlando soon. 
 Orlando? 
 That's not... The shipping arrangement that we agreed upon. 
 We said Fort Lauderdale, 'cause that's where I'll be. 
 Sorry. Plans change. 
 I'm on the lam with my angel... 
 [Whispers] Caleb. 
 Gonna need a little more context on that. 
 He's the lead singer of Sacrificial Jam. 
 They're, like, Richmond's fifth best conviction rock band. 
 That's not the context I was looking for. 
 Okay, I'll drop a pin. Bye! 
 Wait. 
 Can we talk a little more about your selective memory? 
 I don't lie. 
 Okay. What's wrong? 
 It's work. 
 Work is a stupid idiot.

 [Siren wailing] 
 Man : You see that sign? Don't touch the driver. 
 Hey, put your phone down next time! 
 [Horns honking and blaring] 
 Man : Not my fault. 
 All I'm saying is that sometimes maybe you forget details, and then you make up stories that are better than what actually happened. 
 Yes, it's called storytelling because truth-telling sucks. 
 No, it doesn't. 
 Yes, it does. 
 Human beings can't handle the whole truth. 
 Yes, we can. 
 [Romantic music playing] 
 Whoa! 
 [Chuckles] You are rock-solid. 
 [Exhales] 
 Oh. Mnh. 
 Ow. What's wrong with you? Why are you biting me? 
 [Whispers] Haven't had my lunch yet. 
 Then go get a sandwich. 
 Ooh. I love finger food. 
 What are you doing? 
 Shh. 
 No. What are you doing? What are you doing? 
 Unclench. 
 What are you... what? 
 Come on, just let me in there. 
 No! Get out of there. 
 Stop being a little bitch! 
 It hurts. 
 Unclench! 
 Why would you do this? 
 Ahh. 
 What's wrong with you? 
 Ooh! 
 [Whispering] I know something that'll loosen you up. 
 [Plastic rustles] 
 Ah! 
 What the... 
 Where was that? 
 What? You said you like to party. 
 How is this a party?

 Oh, right. 
 Let's do it on the casket. 
 No! 
 What is wrong with you? 
 Your loss.

 Hey, hey, hey. Where'd you get that? 
 That dude just gave it to me. 
 I'm sorry. She was so young. 
 We used to surf together. 
 She would've wanted me to dress like this. 
 [Whispers indistinctly] 
 [Romantic music playing] 
 Hey. 
 Hi. 
 I'm Nate. 
 Hi. Uh, nice to meet you. Um, you're a piece of sh1t. 
 Like, a real piece of sh1t. 
 So why don't you take your board shorts and your flip-flops and your piece of sh1t face, and get the hell out of here before I have to call the cops? 
 Okay, lady, relax. Okay, it's not my fault. 
 I met your loser friend at a bar, and she asked me to come to a party. 
 How is this a party? 
 That's what I said! 
 [Moaning] 
 Oh, my god. What a sh1t show. 
 Looks like someone didn't get enough love from daddy. 
 That's my sister. 
 That's not your sister. 
 That's my half-sister. 
 She looks nothing like you. 
 Her mom's an... idiot. 
 Well... yeah. 
 [Continues moaning] 
 Whoa, whoa, whoa. Hold up. 
 The sh1t show was aunt Vanessa? And you made out with her? 
 I didn't make out with her. She stuck her finger up my... 
 No, whoa, whoa! What... don't tell her that. 
 What? You wanted the truth, and the truth is that when your aunt is wasted, which is pretty much every single day, she'll make out with anybody with a mouth. 
 Robin : No, that's not true. 
 [Lid creaks] 
 So who's funeral was it? 
 It doesn't matter. 
 Of course it matters. She was a close family friend. 
 Oh, really? 
 Mm-hmm. 
 What was her name? 
 Beth. 
 Be... 
 Becky? 
 Beth? 
 Becky? Becky. 
 Bethanny. Is that... 
 Uh, Beckanny. 
 Beckanny something or other. 
 That's not a name. 
 Okay, well, whatever. 
 What I do remember is that she was bipolar, which led to anxiety, which led to prescriptions... 
 Mom! Mom! Dad's right. Nobody cares. 
 [Vanessa moaning] Oh! 
 I hate this story. 
 Yeah. Keep going. 
 [Organ continues playing] 
 Come on. Come on. I didn't get your name. 
 That's 'cause I didn't give it to you. 
 Would you just stop for a second? 
 Ohh. 
 All right, look, I think you are smokin' hot, and I'd love to take you out. 
 Wow. You stole flowers from a dead person. 
 She's not gonna miss 'em. 
 You know, that's really disrespectful to poor what's-her-name. 
 Damn it. What was her name? 
 Look, when we tell our kids this story, they're gonna want to know that you took the flowers. 
 You're right. 
 Well, that's... 
 Mmm, that's a salty finger. 
 Oh, buddy. 
 Buddy, buddy, buddy, buddy, buddy, I would not do that if I were you. 
 [Mouth full] Mind your business, bro. 
 Yeah, that was... up in my business. 
 What, are you jealous? 
 No, "jealous" is not the word I would use. 
 Hey, get this sh1t away from my sister. 
 Well, it's not hers. 
 That's not mine. 
 Yeah, but I don't want it. 
 I want it! 
 No. It's cocaine. 
 I know it's cocaine. 
 I don't... 
 Oh, I love cocaine! 
 Please just take it. 
 What do I look like, a cokehead? 
 I don't wanna do it. It's not my cocaine. 
 I understand, but I'm going with her. You're not, so why don't you get rid of it? 
 I don't care who you're going with. 
 [Tinkling] 
 [Laughing] 
 Holy sh1t, that's a lot of coke. 
 Ohh. It's, like, $5,000 worth of coke. 
 That's, like, 15 years in prison worth of coke. 
 Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! 
 I'm late for a funeral! Bye-ee! 
 [Both groan] 
 [Snorts] Oh, my nose is burning. Is your nose burning? 
 My nose is on fire, but it feels really good. 
 Oh, my god, I feel great. 
 I feel like someone shoved a cup of coffee up my nose. 
 Yeah, I kinda feel like I wanna work out. Do you work out? 
 Of course I work out. Check it out. 
 Oh, wow. 
 Right. Hey, what's your favorite city? 
 I really like Boston. 
 I could totally live in Boston. 
 And they have great Indian food. 
 Oh, I love ethnic food! 
 [Whispers] Right? 
 You know what else is great? 
 What? 
 Music. 
 Oh, my god. I love music! It's so good, right? 
 Oh, my god, you should see my CD collection. 
 Do you read? 
 I can read. 
 Oh, reading's the best. I  love  books. 
 Books are the best! 
 Wait. You're not a Bruins fan, are you? 
 What's a Bruin? 
 It's a bear.

 Hey, do you wanna see my place? 
 I would love to see your place.

 Hey, what's your name again? 
 Ew! You didn't even know her name? 
 What is wrong with you?! 
 And that is why we don't tell the whole truth. 
 I think I love you. 
 Oh, if that's a line, you don't need it. 
 That's not a line. 
 Well, then you need to grow a pair of balls. 
 I got a big set of balls, and I love you. 
 How? You've known me for two days. 
 Doesn't mean I can't feel it.

 No! 
 Too much? 
 Yeah, it was too... well, it's different. 
 Ah!

 Well, remember when I said I design roller coasters? 
 Mm-hmm. 
 What I meant to say is, I-I-I really like roller coasters. 
 Yeah, I figured. 
 This doesn't really look like the apartment of a roller coaster designer. 
 Right. [Chuckles] 
 Yeah. 
 So what do you do?

 I don't... What's... [pops lips] 
 I play hockey. 
 Oh. Sorry. Um... no.

 I was an enforcer! 
 He basically just fought people. 
 'Cause that's what goons do! 
 That's awesome! 
 I wanna go to goon school when I grow up! 
 There's no school for it. 
 You just have to have a keen sense of right versus wrong! 
 [Loud thud, squish] 
 Oh. 
 Crowd : Ohh! 
 [Muffled voice] And a rock for a head. 
 It kind of made him who he is today. 
 You know what? It actually did. 
 [Sticks clatter] 
 [Scattered booing] 
 It taught me loyalty! 
 It taught me to protect the ones I love!

 It taught me to do the right thing... 
 Even if it's unpopular! 
 Uhh! 
 Man : Whoa!

 Woman : Get off the ice!

 You suck, Ithaca! You suck! You suck! 
 What I meant to ask is, what do you do for money? 
 Oh. 
 I got a part-time job at this biotech pharma company. 
 I don't really know what they do. 
 Well, that's sounds workable. 
 I could use some stability in my life. 
 Yeah, I'm not gonna be there for long. I'm going pro. 
 Boom! 
 Uh, hey, Nate? 
 Yeah? 
 Did you take off the condom? 
 Well, I remember the s*x was amazing. 
 And it got way more amazing for a minute. 
 W-what? I thought you took it off. 
 Why would I take it off? 
 I don't know. Feel little Nate? 
 Yeah, I felt a little Nate, but... 
 It's bigger than that. 
 Mm. 
 Do you see anything? 
 There's definitely something up there. 
 Looks like a lot of liquid. 
 Well, what color is it? 
 It's white and cream liquid. 
 Uh, what should I do? 
 You should probably try and get it out. 
 What do you want me to do, use my finger? 
 You could use your tongue. 
 Oh, I think I love you. 
 A Magnum?! 
 What? 
 You... are not... a Magnum! 
 Hey, it worked the first six times! 
 Why would you even buy magnums?! 
 Same reason I don't like tight pants, okay? 
 [Exhales sharply] 
 Relax. It's gonna be fine. 
 All right, I'm gonna ask you a favor. 
 You seem like just the boring, stable person I need in my life right now, so I'm gonna ask you two things... 
 Don't ever lie to me and don't ever,  ever  tell me to relax. 
 Okay, fine, rela... 
 Oh! 
 All right. Okay. I'm not a Magnum. 
 It's okay. I'm not ovulating anyway. 
 Then what are you complaining about? 
 It fell off 'cause his pen1s is too small! 
 You know that's genetic, right? 
 You're  genetic. 
 I know. 
 You admitted it! 
 [Pops] 
 Oh, man. What are we gonna do? What are we gonna do? 
 What are we gonna do? 
 We don't have to decide right now. 
 We'll, um, we'll think about it and we'll weigh the options, and I will make the decision.

 What decision? 
 You brought it up, not me. 
 Um...

 I don't know if I'm ready for this. 
 Or am I?  Am  I? 
 I don't know. I barely know you. Are you? 
 I don't know. Maybe? I mean, this is  really  scary. 
 I know. And twins? That's super scary. 
 I know. What do you do with twins? 
 I think you stick one on each titty. 
 And then you say stupid sh1t like that, and it really makes me not wanna do this with you! 
 What else you wanna do? 
 Delilah : I'm really confused right now. 
 You were pregnant. 
 Yep. 
 So what was there to decide? 
 Well, I had to make a choice. 
 Whether you were gonna have a boy or a girl? 
 No. 
 What color hair I was gonna have? 
 Um... [sighs] I had to make a choice, uh... 
 About whether or not I was gonna keep you. 
 You were thinking about giving us up for adoption?! 
 No, not exactly. 
 Well, who was gonna be our mom and dad? 
 Ooh. [Groans] 
 I had to, uh, make a choice a-about whether or not I wanted to take a-a trip to the... 
 Um, Europe. 
 That's what you're going with? 
 [Whispers] Yeah. 
 See, there... there are a lot of women, who, um, find themselves in a position where they feel like they have to choose between being a mom and going to Europe, and... and it's a... it's a very, very serious decision and one that should never be taken lightly. 
 And make no mistake,  every  woman deserves the right to choose... Europe if she so desires. 
 [Voice breaking] But just know this... 
 Every time I look at you... 
 I am so thankful that I decided to stay in Syracuse. 
 [Romantic music playing] 
 [Slurping] 
 That was beautiful. 
 So your mother gave up a trip to Europe, and I gave up a hockey career for you guys. 
 You didn't give up a hockey career. 
 Yes, I did. 
 And we both made the right choice. 
 Did you ever go to Europe? 
 Just once. Last year of high school. 
 What? 
 Oh, is that too much truth? 
 So when did you get married? 
 Um... 
 You wanna take this one or should I? 
 I think it's your turn.

 I-I do. 
 Then I now pronounce you man and wife. 
 You may kiss the bride. 
 Oh. 
 [Both chuckle] 
 Who the hell is Carlos? 
 He's our real dad. Keep up. 
 I married him so that I could help him get his green card, and he paid for my college. 
 It was just a ceremony and a few I.N.S. Meetings. 
 Wait. So you guys aren't actually married? 
 Nope. 
 No, I couldn't find Carlos to get the annulment before you guys arrived, so we never really got around to doing it. 
 So why do you wear rings? 
 They're promise rings. 
 A promise that we made to each other, that we would someday get it together and actually get married... Which we will. Someday we will. 
 Will we? 
 Jared : I can't believe you're not married. 
 I can't believe you two are still together. 
 You guys  are the sh1t shows! 
 What about us? I mean, we're bastards! 
 A piece of paper isn't the important thing. 
 It's not. 
 No. 
 Wait. So my dad's a goon, my mom's a liar, and I'm a b*st*rd? 
 And I almost went to Europe? 
 What's next? Is my name even Jared? 
 Of course it is. 
 Well, technically... 
 Now? 
 Why not? 
 Okay.

 Yeah, listen, you know, your dad hadn't gotten a lot of sleep when he filled out the birth registration. 
 My name's jareb?! 
 Just on all your official documents, yes. 
 [Whispers] What? 
 Just for the record, my actual name is Jareb? 
 Yeah. But you know what, honey? It's fine. We can change it. 
 No, you cannot! This is my choice! 
 My choice is to keep it, because it's the truth! 
 I am Jareb! 
 I can't handle any more truth! 
 Exactly. We finally understand. 
 Now with that said, we have to take a tiny detour to Orlando. 
 What? 
 No more questions, right? 
 Oh, wait. You're joking, right? Why are we going to Orlando? 
 I can't tell you. 
 Yes, you can. 
 No, I can't. 
 Have you not learned anything in the last 20 minutes?

 One, don't ever lie to me. Always be honest and...
