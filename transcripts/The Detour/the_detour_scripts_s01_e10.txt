 Just finish the story. 
 I've already told you everything. 
 Did your wife sleep with your billionaire boss? 
 Did you guys break up? 
 I know you're not married, but are you still together? 
 And what about your kids? You leave them all alone at the resort? 
 And that Chazz kid, he was such a dick to your daughter. 
 What about, uh, Billy Evans? 
 Yeah, did he publish that story on the dangerous hand sanitizer? 
 Finish the damn story. 
 Okay.

 [Birds calling] 
 Well, hello there. 
 I really love this. 
 And I deserve it. 
 You know what? You really do. 
 It's so beautiful. 
 I wouldn't know. 
 I'm only looking at you. 
 Oh, shut up. [Giggles] 
 But I mean it. This boat? Rock solid. 
 Yeah, it's really just my shuttle boat. 
 I couldn't get my ocean liner in this tiny marina. 
 Oh, my god. You're so rich. 
 Gupta's voice : Champagne? 
 What? 
 Would you like some champagne? 
 [Ship horn blows] 
 It's very expensive. 
 [Horn blows] 
 Oh. Yeah. Oh, yes. Why... Why stop now? 
 Right? 
 [Laughs] Yes, why stop now? 
 Mmm. It's Norwegian. 
 Is it? 
 Given to me by the king himself. 
 Mm.

 He says, "Puts sh1t in perspective, don't it?"

 Yeah, I guess it does. Sorry.

 Sir, honor to meet you. I'm a... I'm a huge fan. 
 Were you just jumping after that boat? 
 I was. That one, yep. 
 Why did you think that was his boat? 
 It's a very nice boat. 
 Yeah, but it's not the boat of a billionaire. 
 It's not even the boat of a millionaire. 
 Well, not when I see this boat, no. 
 And this isn't even the main boat. 
 What? 
 This is the boat that gets you to the real boat. 
 There's two boats. 
 Even if that tiny fishing boat  were  my boat, why were you trying to jump after it? 
 Yeah, it's not like it's a public ferry. 
 I set my own schedule. 
 It's a very nice boat. 
 It was a real sad jump. [Laughs] 
 Did you trip? 'Cause that's about how far you got. 
 Am I right? Am I right? 
 It... it was a very pathetic jump. 
 Yeah. 
 [Laughing] It was really bad. It was like...

 Oh, yes. 
 Uh, expensive champagne gets you drunk  real  quick.

 [Indistinct conversations, laughter] 
 He's over there hanging out with his "boyz," and I can't even get him to talk. 
 [Shouting playfully] 
 Yeah, Chazz is a dick. 
 I know, but I put in so much time with him. 
 It'd be stupid to just throw that all away. 
 The good times still outweigh the bad times. 
 If you were to go up to him right now, what would you say? 
 Fist bump. 
 Awkward, porcupine, Mohawk, reindeer, snowman, orbit, rooster, buck buck buck, starfish. 
 Yeah! 
 Yeah, I wouldn't do that. 
 Sir, I am so grateful for the use of one of your traditional garbs. Namaste. 
 Yes, it's... It's my sister's. 
 Ooh, you got one of her kitten bikinis, too. 
 Stop, stop. Look. 
 [Clears throat] 
 [Sighs] 
 So, sir, the reason I am here, and I have been through quite a journey to get here. 
 Mm. 
 But I got it, and it's this. 
 [Pops lips] 
 What the hell is that? 
 Woman : Hand sanitizer? 
 [Scoffs] That's what this is all about? 
 Are you kidding me? 
 Look at what I am offering, and you're just staring at some stupid pack of hand sanitizer? 
 It's not stupid! 
 [Files flutter] 
 This could destroy mankind as we know it! 
 This stuff doesn't really work, does it? 
 That's exactly what I said. 
 Okay, no, no, no, this is not your regular hand sanitizer, okay? 
 This particular hand sanitizer... 
 [Inhales deeply] ...Is laced with... 
 [Ship horn blows in distance] 
 Triclosan. 
 Triclosan. 
 Tri... Triclosan. Tri... is it... Is it Triclosan? 
 It's Triclosan. 
 It's Triclosan. Triclosan. 
 Okay, instead of your usual alcohol-based formulas... 
 Which are very effective, by the way... 
 [Clicks teeth] Right. 
 P.F.R. has put in an antibacterial ingredient which is known to cause endocrine disruption. 
 I'm sorry, but none of this means anything to me. 
 I called a lab in Pyongyang... That's the bad Korea... 
 And they said this sh1t was bad, so  you know  it's bad. 
 An E.P.A. study of Triclosan in male rats has shown a decreased level of testosterone in sperm production... 
 No dude wants that! 
 With a moderate increase in estrogen levels. 
 Rat tits. 
 Mm. 
 Female rats exposed have shown altered levels of thyroid hormones... 
 Mm. 
 And early onset puberty. 
 You girls grow up fast enough these days. 
 C.D.C. doesn't endorse it. 
 A.M.A. put out a scathing report on it. 
 Tell him about the F.D.A. 
 They've been fumbling with rulings on it since the Nixon administration. 
 And that was the president who let all the water out of that gate! 
 This hand sanitizer is not meant for humans. 
 I know what I have to do! 
 [Giggles] 
 So I ask you, sir, please,  please  do something about this. 
 What do you want me to do about it? 
 Stop it! It's your company. Please. 
 A very wise man once told me, what's right is right. 
 What's what is what? 
 What's right is right. 
 Mm-hmm. 
 Who said that? 
 You did. 
 No, I didn't. 
 Yes, you did. You... you gave a whole speech about it. 
 I give a lot of speeches. 
 He lives his life by that. 
 What does that even mean? 
 It's like saying apples are apples or left is left. 
 So black and white. Life is a myriad of color between those two absolutes. 
 [Voice breaks] But what's right is right.
