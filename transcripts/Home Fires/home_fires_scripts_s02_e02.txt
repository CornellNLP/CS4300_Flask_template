 My name is Captain Marek Novotny. 
 And I'm very sorry you were involved, Mrs... 
 Simms. 
 Bob Simms - leg wound. 
 Right. Bed six. 
 Now it's your turn - to seriously consider radiation treatment. 
 I will seriously consider it. 
 His wife is divorcing him for adultery and plans to publicly name me as the other party. 
 I don't know what to do. 
 Keep Mrs Barden away! 
 (TWIG SNAPS) 
 (FAINT MEN'S VOICES) 
 (AIR-RAID SIREN) 
 They pick their moments, don't they? 
 Where's Mrs Barden? We tried to bring her in, but she's refusing. 
 Number, please, caller. 
 (SIREN CONTINUES) 
 Hello, caller. Number, please? 
 Frances? Frances? 
 You need to come into the shelter immediately. 
 Helen Lakin is being buried today. 
 And part of me feels I ought to be there. 
 Peter held her work in such high regard. 
 Frances. I want to stay here. 
 And get killed? 
 Frances. 
 I want to stay here! 
 (DRONE OF PLANES OVERHEAD) 
 Then I'm staying with you. 
 (PLAN ES DIRECTLY OVERH EAD) 
 Laura? 
 Are you still coming this week? 
 School outing with the kids? 
 The outing. Yes. 
 The girls will interrogate you like they're in the Gestapo. 
 And the boys will literally fall over themselves to impress you. 
 Laura. 
 So you'll come, then? 
 Yes. 
 Terrific. 
 (ALL-CLEAR SOUNDS) 
 Man : All right, then. That's the all-clear. 
 La u ra? 
 Most operators refuse to stay during a raid. 
 You handled it...very well. 
 Thanks. 
 When I was told you'd be training me, my heart sank. 
 You know...I never set out to steal Spencer from you. 
 Clearly. You couldn't have done that, even if you'd wanted to. 
 Oh, I think I could've. 
 Believe me...no. 
 No, I was...looking to offload him for some time. 
 And you did me a huge favour by showing an interest when you did. 
 After all... what girl wouldn't rather have a pilot... over a postman? 
 Well... me? 
 I see what you mean, but... 
 No offence. You don't count. 
 Why? 
 Let's leave it there, shall we? 
 (DOOR SLAMMING) 
 Laura? 
 What is it? 
 'Charlotte Bowers is to divorce Wing Commander Richard Bowers on grounds of adultery.' 
 'The co-respondent is named as Miss Laura Campbell of Great Paxford, Cheshire.' 
 (VEHICLE HORN) 
 Oh, I'm looking for Mr Simms. 
 Of course. In there. 
 I tried to come earlier, but there was a raid. 
 Dad! 
 Dad. 
 I was er...I was just passing. 
 I er...I wanted to see how you were. 
 After everything. 
 Like the hair, by the way. 
 Oh. (LAUGHS NERVOUSLY) 
 Well, Adam... thinks it suits me. 
 Everything suits you. 
 (LAUGHS WEAKLY) 
 I don't really know why I'm bothering with all of this. 
 The Germans already have Adam. They'll have his garden soon enough. 
 Some of us are working day and night to make sure they don't. 
 Germany has everything. 
 I mean, everything that the French had, plus everything we left behind at Dunkirk... 
 You know. 
 The French had a much bigger army than us. 
 What chance do we have? 
 Sometimes... the pressure of everything that's happening actually feels palpable. 
 As if I could reach up and push against it. 
 Yeah. I know. It's as if it's bearing down on us. 
 You feel it too? 
 Mm-hm. From the minute I wake up. 
 But... thankfully, we have a thing called beer (!) (LAUGHS) 
 Beer works wonders against all that. 
 Well, for me, it's gardening and a spot of violent weeding. 
 Well, perhaps you should find a different pressure valve, because that weed happens to be a rather nice foxglove. 
 (CLATTERING) 
 (CLATTERING CONTINUES) 
 I thought we kept the map of the farm in the dresser draw. 
 What? 
 The map of the farm, Steph. 
 Where is it? 
 I don't know. 
 Right. 
 If it's not in the dresser, I don't know where it is. 
 Can't it keep till morning? 
 Do you think the German High Command shut up shop when the sun goes down? 
 What are you talking about? 
 Stan. Come back to bed. 
 While we sleep... they plan. 
 Go up. 
 I need to get on. 
 With what? 
 I haven't got time for a debate. 
 Stan. Come to bed. 
 You go. 
 I can't sleep. 
 ♪♪ 
 Ready? 
 How many more, for crying out loud? 
 Show some respect. 
 So far, so straightforward. 
 But... we now come to the matter of the factory. 
 In the event of his death... Peter has instructed that his business interests... should principally be transferred to you. 
 Frances? 
 Principally? 
 Principally. 
 Surely that should be 'entirely'. 
 In a codicil to his will... Peter instructed that 20%... of the company... should be placed in a separate trust. 
 For who? 
 While the size of the portion placed in trust can be disclosed... the identity of the beneficiary cannot. 
 May I see? 
 Well, there must be some mistake, RogeL In all conscience... 
 I felt you had to know at the earliest opportunity. 
 What does this all mean? 
 That's the last of it. 
 What a pokey little place this is. 
 It's not too late... to change your mind. 
 Nor you yours. 
 I give you a week before you telephone. 
 Begging me to bring you back. 
 I've told you what it'll take for me to make such a request, Douglas. 
 That ball is entirely in your court. 
 One week. 
 (DOOR OPENING AND CLOSING) 
 Hurry up, Stan. Want to get it all out before the sun goes down. 
 What's all this? 
 Littering the fields with old machinery to stop the Jerries being able to land. 
 You what? 
 They've done it all over the south. 
 When they try and land further north, we need to make sure they can't. 
 Don't you mean 'if'? 
 Get changed. Check the outhouses for... old cartwheels, feeding troughs anything big enough to foul up a German undercarriage. 
 Off to the hospital? 
 That's right. Yes. 
 Pass on my best wishes to Bob. 
 Thank you. I shall. 
 No milk. 
 None? 
 No. 
 There was a... a coffee house outside Ostrava... 
 I used to frequent as a student. 
 The owner threw out anyone who asked for milk with their coffee. 
 For him, it was... cerna kava... or the door. 
 In time, I learned he was right. 
 Cerna kava. 
 Cerna kava it is. 
 Have you been to see your husband? 
 He's quite badly injured. 
 Weaker than I've ever seen him. 
 He'll expect me to wait on him hand and foot when he comes back home. 
 As his wife or...as his servant? 
 Why do you say that? 
 You told me about a man who... does not like flowers...cos it makes him think of his own mortality. 
 Who does not want children because... 
 ..they will get in the way of his work. 
 It makes me wonder... how such a man thinks of you. 
 And why such a woman would stay with such a man. 
 And...what she... 
 ..might see in me. 
 Part of me... thought Bob might never return. 
 Thought? 
 Or hoped? 
 I've tried to imagine what it would feel like. 
 Does that make me a terrible person? 
 No. 
 Not to me. 
 I enjoyed the feeling. 
 Terrible now? 
 Mrs Barden? 
 Mrs Barden? 
 If now is not a suitable time, I completely understand. But I... felt compelled...to come and offer my deepest condolences. 
 No, please. I... 
 You were the last person I expected to see. 
 I...discovered that the sea air is not all that it's cracked up to be. 
 So you're back for good? 
 Well, let's just say that my... 
 ..situation is in a state of flux. 
 Thank you, Claire. 
 Please. 
 Peter gave me that bench for our 20th wedding anniversary. 
 We used to sit there in the warm evenings. 
 Such a tragedy. 
 Your husband was a gentleman. 
 So er... 
 Where are you and Douglas living? 
 I saw your house had been... requisitioned. 
 I've... taken a house on the outskirts of the village. 
 Frances. 
 My mother was always fond of saying that... life would be exceedingly boring if it took a linear path. 
 No bumps or twists. 
 No... surprises. 
 But then, at times like this... what one would give for simple, dependable boredom. 
 I'd give...everything I have... for another minute with him. 
 Every single thing. 
 Thank you for coming in this morning, Dr Campbell. 
 Like other doctors we've had, I imagine you've read everything there is to read about this treatment. 
 Pretty much. 
 So forgive me if what I'm about to say sounds like I'm teaching you to suck eggs. 
 Is sucking eggs part of the procedure? 
 I must've missed that particular article (!) If only it were. 
 We'll need you here every day for five weeks. 
 I've re-arranged my surgery hours. 
 Re-arranged? 
 Dr Campbell, this treatment won't just tire you out a tad. 
 It will exhaust you, physically and mentally. 
 I understand. 
 (HUM OF CONVERSATION) 
 (THE ROOM FALLS SILENT) 
 Didn't she go to live by the sea? 
 Perhaps the sea went round and asked her to leave (!) 
 Welcome back, Mrs Cameron. It's nice to see you. 
 I don't trust her. 
 (CLEARS THROAT) Let's er... start with apologies for her absence from... our president. 
 Mrs Barden. May I propose... that we postpone this evening's meeting... out of respect for Frances? 
 I... I visited Mrs Barden yesterday afternoon and... it was painfully apparent that she is in no condition to continue as president for the foreseeable future. 
 I completely agree. 
 Surely we can soldier on for now. 
 Can a ship steer a true course without its rudder, Mrs Farrow? 
 However great our compassion for Mrs Barden at this terrible time... the branch needs a viable president. 
 Here we go. 
 Do you have someone in mind, Mrs Cameron? 
 Actually, I do. 
 Yes. 
 Oh. 
 You think I'm suggesting myself. 
 No, no, no, no, no. 
 But I wouldn't hesitate in proposing... Mrs Simms. 
 Me? 
 As branch secretary, you have been formidable in your organising over many years. 
 You know the WI protocol inside out. 
 As a rough show of hands, who would support Mrs Simms taking over? 
 It's very flattering, of course, but... I couldn't take it on. 
 Not with Bob back. I'm sorry. 
 Then the only viable alternative... is you, Mrs Cameron. 
 Me? 
 You have the experience, the skill. 
 You have the time to guide this branch until Frances is able to return. 
 As a rough show of hands, who would support Mrs Cameron taking over? 
 In the short term. 
 In the short term. 
 I'm really not sure about this. 
 ♪♪ 
 
 
 
 (CLEARS THROAT) 
 On behalf of all the staff here, I'd like to offer our sincere condolences. 
 Mr Barden was a wonderful employer. 
 He'll be sadly missed by everyone. 
 Thank you, Mr Taylor. 
 Erm...it was the er... accounts you wished to see? 
 Yes. 
 Do you want to look at these here? 
 Or at home? 
 I'll get someone to help you. 
 Oh, I think we can manage these to the car. 
 But these only cover the current quarter. 
 This area... holds the full Barden accounts. 
 Bob. 
 I wondered when you were planning on coming by. 
 I... had errands to run. 
 I brought you some cigarettes. 
 No chocolate? 
 We've... run out. 
 Sorry. 
 I'll erm... bring some next time. 
 How are you feeling? 
 Well, they've reduced the morphine, which is a good sign, I suppose. 
 But er...I'm still in a lot of pain. 
 The doctor told me there's no possibility of you climbing stairs for some time. So... I'm putting a bed in the study. 
 Bob, what... what happened? 
 Stray artillery landed 50 feet from where I was standing. 
 Lifted me clean off my feet. 
 Shrapnel hit my arm... pulped my leg... broke my tibia. 
 You're lucky you weren't killed. 
 Could've been worse. 
 Let me help. 
 Thank you. 
 That said... I have come back with an idea for a new novel. 
 Set on the beach at Dunkirk. 
 And dedicated to my fellow veterans. 
 That's better. 
 But next time... don't forget the chocolate. 
 Yes? 
 Couldn't help seeing your name in the paper. 
 Pity it had to be about that and not something more savoury. 
 Very messy business, I'm sure. But, if you want my advice - 
 I really, really don't. Your mistake was to go for a married man. 
 It's much less complicated to go after single RAF boys. 
 No wives. 
 Do you see? 
 What, you're speaking from experience, are you? 
 Shut up in the telephone exchange all day, not a pilot, single or married, in sight? 
 I'm only trying to help. 
 Help yourself. I don't need it. 
 Oh. You gave me a shilling too much. 
 Thank you. 
 It's good to know the majority of people in Great Paxford are honourable (!) 
 Thank you, Mrs Talbot. 
 Next? 
 She's brave to show her face. 
 I'll give her that. 
 I'd go so far as to say shameless. 
 I can hear you, Mrs Talbot. 
 Every word, as you intend, no doubt. 
 It's your mother and father I feel sorry for. 
 Disgusting! 
 I could list a few of your past mistakes for the village to hang out with their laundry. 
 Good day. 
 Thank you. 
 What can I get you? 
 Any luck? 
 No evidence of debt or sudden financial injection recently that would need repaying. 
 Well, there must be something. You'd expect something to suggest where a 20% share of the business might be owed. 
 I'll keep going back. 
 Who...or what... could he have promised it to? 
 You must have some idea. 
 You can ask me a thousand times. 
 I can think of nothing to explain it. 
 Keep the knee rested, Mr Hudson. 
 That means no allotment until the swelling has gone down. 
 Right. Thank you, Doctor. 
 Thought I had a four o'clock. 
 And a quarter past four. 
 No. 
 May I see the diary, please? 
 What for? 
 Erica, have you been cancelling appointments? 
 I told you. I can handle the treatment and work. 
 I'm not a fool. 
 I have no intention of running myself into a grave any earlier than is necessary. 
 I haven't cancelled appointments. 
 Well, then, where have they gone? 
 To Dr Clarke's surgery. 
 Dr Clarke? 
 Several patients have transferred their records to him. 
 How many is 'several'? 
 Eight. 
 Since the notice in the paper about the Bowers' divorce. 
 I'm fairly certain. 
 With the cost of my treatment, the timing couldn't be worse. 
 (SWITCHING BETWEEN TELEPHONE CONVERSATIONS) 
 "Hello. Yes. I'm calling from RAF Tabley Wood." 
 "I'm wondering if I could trouble you to place an advertisement on your village notice board." 
 "We're looking for staff to work in the officer's mess, behind the bar..." 
 Spencer just dropped something off. 
 Thought you might like to see. 
 What's this? 
 Why don't you open it? 
 Oh. It's from your mother! 
 (CHUCKLES) 
 If she'd included a cot, we'd have an entire nursery (!) 
 (CHUCKLES) 
 Did you ask her to send these? 
 I thought it might help you get ready. 
 I have had a baby before, Bryn. 
 I know you have, Mim. 
 I do know what to do. 
 But I want you to get as excited over this child as you did when you were expecting David. 
 It's... it's time to give this one some attention now. 
 Why do you go out and wait for the bus every morning... if you've given up all hope he'll return? 
 This... isn't about David. 
 This... this is about the new baby. 
 David's brother. Or sister. 
 They're separate. 
 Whether David is alive or Alive! 
 Whether or not he is He is! 
 Pack this lot up and send it back to your mother. We don't need it. 
 David's baby clothes'll fit perfectly. I've no doubt about that. 
 (DOOR CLOSES) 
 OK. Bit more. 
 Bit more. Ooh! 
 Perfect. 
 And the chair? 
 Er... you can, but I don't think he's going to be able to sit at his desk to work. 
 Thank you. So now it's just the bed. 
 And where is that? 
 Upstairs. 
 What are you doing? 
 Places to hide. 
 Guns. 
 Guns? Mm. 
 We hide them where they can't find them, but you'll have them close by. 
 For what? 
 To defend yourselves when I go back. What else? 
 Against the entire German Army (?) 
 They loot and pillage, Steph. 
 They won't take no for an answer. 
 Look. I understand you've come back full of what you saw in France. 
 My father's old service revolver should still work. 
 You haven't moved it from the attic, have you? 
 Why would I? 
 Go on. 
 Stan. 
 This is how the Czech Army insists its soldiers make beds. 
 Very good. 
 Except, I think Bob might wonder why a soldier has made his bed and not me. 
 Perhaps it shouldn't be so neat. 
 Thank you for today. 
 Thank you. 
 Marek, you should go back to camp. 
 Goodbye, Mrs Simms. 
 Goodbye... Captain Novotny. 
 ♪♪ 
 You're the very first person to respond to the advertisement. 
 I happened to be walking past the church notice board when it was put up. 
 We've struggled to replace our bar staff since they were reassigned to more important duties. 
 Is it only officers I'll be serving or all ranks? 
 Just officers. 
 You'll soon know your Gloucester Gladiator from your Hawker Hurricane. 
 My what? 
 Types of plane. 
 Oh. 
 Reliable as the day it was issued. 
 Stan? 
 My old man told me he killed five Germans with this. 
 Is all this really necessary? 
 Jerries aren't invading with catapults. 
 Only good German is a dead one. 
 Aim for the head... or the chest. 
 Stan! 
 I'd keep this in here. Good at close range. 
 We'll hide this in the cowshed. 
 Our scrap all over the fields is one thing. 
 But hiding loaded weapons on the farm is... 
 Stan, I don't like this one little bit! 
 They're absolutely brutal with civilians. just... unnecessary mouths to feed. 
 It's basic self-defence, Steph. 
 Kill or be killed. 
 Come on, children. No straggling! 
 We're nearly there. Come on. 
 Come on. Collect your coat and things and come straight back out to meet your parents. 
 Quick as you can, now. Come on, girls. 
 Come on. Here you go, boys. 
 Oh, thank you both so much for helping. 
 Oh, I loved it. Any time you wanna help, you're more than welcome. 
 Isobel? 
 Ooh! Are we off? 
 Laura. 
 You mustn't let the gossip get to you too much, eh? 
 Hello, ladies. 
 It's just people. Too much time on their hands and too few brains in their heads. 
 I'll try not to. 
 Excuse me? 
 Talk of the devil. 
 What is she doing here? 
 Miss Campbell helped with today's outing. Is there a problem? 
 Yes. Yes, there is a problem. 
 I... 
 I am not happy with that girl... being around my child! 
 You can be sure I will be writing a letter to the board of governors. 
 I think you're being very unfair, Mrs Talbot. 
 You are free to think what you like, Miss Fenchurch. 
 Her kind of behaviour may be all the rage where you come from. 
 But it is completely unacceptable here! 
 (VEHICLE HORN) 
 Hop in, Laura. I'll drop you home. 
 I'd stay well clear of her, if I were you. 
 Fan of yours? 
 Just leave it, Tom. 
 People are judged by the company they keep, young man. 
 Mrs Talbot, your daughter's waiting for you. Please. 
 Your problem is with me, Mrs Talbot. Leave him out of it. 
 I'm trying to do him a favour... by keeping him out of you! 
 Mrs Talbot! Go inside and collect your daughter now! 
 Please. 
 Come on. Get in. 
 We'll run her over when she comes out. 
 She's right, though. You can't afford to be associated with me. 
 Laura Stay away from me, Tom. 
 For your own sake. 
 I've been looking deeper into the accounts and... there is something I don't completely understand. 
 Well, if you don't, what hope is there for us? 
 These... are as yet unbanked cheques. 
 From the company account, post-dated the first of each month until the end of this financial year. 
 All written out to Helen Lakin... the company accountant. 
 All this has been happening since 1929. 
 But...they don't appear anywhere in the books. 
 So she was on the fiddle? 
 Oh, I don't believe it. 
 Not Helen. 
 (KNOCK ON DOOR) 
 Yes? 
 The police just delivered this for you, Mrs Barden. 
 Leave it on the side, would you, please? 
 I'm sorry, Alison. 
 How do these cheques move us any closer to finding out who Peter left 20% of the company to? 
 Actually... I think this might get us quite close. 
 Why do you say that? 
 Because... every single cheque... to Helen Lakin... has been signed... by Peter. 
 He knew? 
 Why would he do that? 
 I need these prescriptions signed as soon as you can. 
 Fine. I'll do them now. 
 (THERE IS A GROAN AND A THUD FROM THE OTHER ROOM) 
 Will? 
 I slipped. 
 I'm calling an ambulance. 
 Don't be ridiculous. 
 You could be badly hurt. Sit still! 
 Stay still! 
 It's not that bad. 
 What will you and the girls do when I'm gone? 
 I know the success rate, Erica. I know the prognosis. 
 You have to believe the treatment will work. 
 I know. You're right. 
 God knows I've said as much to my patients enough times, but... the odds against are so high. 
 I don't wanna leave you and the girls. 
 I don't want to leave you. I... 
 I don't want to go. subtitles by Deluxe Teresa? 
 The Wing Commander needs a partner for the next dance. 
 I'll give it my best shot. 
 This is a dangerous time to become the subject of gossip. 
 You're liable to make a loss. 
 You let us worry about our bottom line, Mrs Scotlock. 
 You're a crook, young man. 
 An unexploded bomb has landed just 30 feet from the top of the stairs.
