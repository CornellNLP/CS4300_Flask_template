 Yes, you, man. 
  Where you headed? 
  Where are we headed? 
  Radio, of course, like. 
  Kurupt FM, the baddest out here, yeah? 
  No matter what no-one says, yeah? 
  What have people been saying? 
  No-one's been saying anything, bruv. 
  No-one says anything. 
  Bruv. 
  One day off air, do you know what I'm saying? 
  We's back the next day, like, come true. 
  Right about now, you are locked in to the sounds of the legendary Kurupt FM Oi, oi, oi, what did I say? 
  On Kold FM. 
  Still f*cking Ks though cos that still works. 
  Yeah, but just say Kold FM. 
  Yes, all right, well, no. 
  This is Beats and Grindah, live and direct right now, yeah. 
  Yeah, on Kold FM. 
  Yeah. 
  On Kold FM. 
  That's it. 
  Has it been a good year, then? 
  Yeah, married life has definitely been the fairy tale I had imagined. 
  It's been an amazing year. 
  It's been a pretty rough year on me. 
  What with the marriage and I mean, the marriage is all right but Yeah. . . that night is bittersweet, really. 
  It was. 
  And if I remember us getting married, I remember Kurupt getting raided. 
  Erm Well, you've always got the good memories. 
  And it being a sh1t night No, it was a sh1t night for me. 
  Hold tight, Steves, locked in, wherever you are, yeah? 
  Trust we. 
  Yes, yes, stay strong, bruva. 
  Our hearts go out to you. 
  Bruv, what is this, Loose Women? 
  Why you chatting? 
  What you doing, bruv? 
  Do you feel guilty about Steves getting arrested? 
  Sometimes, the king has to be able to chuck away one of their little prawns, just so the f*ckin' . . the whole team can eat, do you know what I'm saying, like? 
  Checkmate. 
  Oi, oi, oi, yeah. 
  Make sure you promote the rave, yeah? 
  We're not playing at the rave. 
  Yeah. 
  I don't care, promote the rave. 
  Why? 
  It's cutting into our set. 
  Just do it. 
  Just do it. 
  There's a famous quote, I think Grindah came up with, which is, learn from your failures. 
  I think it's true. 
  We'll say for example, with me, having Robin. 
  Yes, it was a massive mistake. 
  Would I do it again? 
  Definitely not. 
  Am I going to get a vasectomy? 
  Yes, I am. 
  Tickle-tickley! 
  That's enough. 
  Has it been a good year, then? 
  It's been a kind of crash course in s*x for me, really, you know? 
  And when I say crash, I mean, literally. 
  Yeah, he has got hurt a couple of times. 
  Yeah. 
  Yeah, but he didn't mind. 
  I didn't mind, no. 
  I mean, I can put anything at him, in him, on him. 
  Sh, don't say this stuff about putting stuff in me. 
  Just Yeah, yeah. . 
  You lot got your subs or what? 
  Yes, I've got my subs. 
  What are you doing? 
  Sorry. 
  Stop touching me. 
  Get on with it, come on. 
  No worries. 
  Has Kurupt been forgotten? 
  We haven't been forgotten, no, because people still come up to me confused, like, "Rah, you're still doing music. 
  " Still doing music. 
  And they know that we are. 
  Yeah, of course we are. 
  So they don't even know we're off air. 
  Yeah. 
  A lot of people don't even know we're off air. 
  Yeah, just give it to me. 
  What's wrong with you? 
  Sorry about that, man. 
  It's a f*cking joke, mate. 
  Do you know how this looks bad on you? 
  We need to f*cking sort this out. 
  We need to get some decks and sh1t, ASAP, player. 
  Yeah. 
  I'm not f*cking going back there. 
  No, I can't go back in there.

  This one? 
  Yeah, my favourite. 
  Yeah, same. 
  Best pose. 
  Stunning. 
  Did you ever imagine that Kurupt would end the way it did? 
  It hasn't ended. 
  Yeah, what do you mean? 
  Kurupt hasn't ended, it's just We're refurbishing. 
  You don't know what's happening behind the scenes. 
  So, you're trying to restart Kurupt? 
  Trying?! 
  Yes! 
  Yes! 
  Do you still need the tit milker? 
  No, you can have that. 
  What are you going to do with it, because it doesn't feel nice? 
  No, we're going to sell it. 
  Doing the car boot later. 
  Yeah. 
  Look, your mum's tit milker's going to earn us some money, so we can get some new equipment. 
  Yes, it is, yeah. 
  Yeah. 
  Yeah, if you're going to sell it, I'd go with breast pump Breast pump, yeah. . . rather than tit milker. . 
  Yeah, radio equipment's proper expensive, man. 
  That's why it's taken us so long to, like, get the money together. 
  You can have that, if you want. 
  Cheers.

  When you got to sell some old tat that no-one else would buy on eBay, best place for it, car-boot sale. 
  Do you think people would want those photos? 
  Well, obviously. 
  Yeah, obviously. 
  Obviously, when they see this sh1t as well, it'll be like, "Rah, OK, I know what time it is. 
  "Have you got any signed photos or anything?" "Yes, I have. 
  " Original. 
  And it's got a number on the back. 
  Is that a number? 
  Yeah, that's three. 
  Number three. 
  You get number three. 
  Number three. 
  Why have you numbered them? 
  Because then they're worth more. 
  Why's that? 
  Because then you know there's only ten of them made. 
  One to ten. 
  Simple numbering system. 
  Right, have you got a bag or anything?

  If you head over there and I'll be with you So, what happened at the court? 
  Well, basically, I just ended up doing community service and, like, getting a tag. 
  Because they said it was such a low-level pirate radio operation that it wasn't worth me getting sent down for. 
  Is it cool to get some red ones? 
  I'll swap you! 
  I've got a rhododendron here you can have. 
  So, the judge said that we technically weren't even a radio station, because the radius of the aerial was so small, he described it as, like, erm, like kids messing around in a bedroom. 
  I should use the spade, shouldn't I, really? 
  Use the hoe. 
  Yeah.

  Right. 
  So, I'm a hustler. 
  And I was raised by hustlers and I was raised by my Hounslow community. 
  And we were all very, very dodgy. 
  You know, very, very, er . . 
  criminals, in a way, but in a friendly way. 
  You know, not like murder, rape, just a bit of fraud, you know? 
  Friendly kind of crime. 
  Let me have a quick, let me have a quick knacker chat with you, darling. 
  A lot of people around Hounslow, you know, they compare me to another geezer, you know, Del Boy. 
  But they call me Dhal Boy.

  Jackie's leaving cos she's being moved down to Hammersmith instead. 
  So, are you and Grindah having to move? 
  Yeah, we're moving home, so, the blocks are being knocked down. 
  But, you know, I'm not going to leave this area and just go and live somewhere random, am I?

  Yeah. 
  I mean, it's up and come, I think. 
  It's such a lovely area. 
  It's so nice. 
  You're still in west, it's all good. 
  Yeah, no, no, absolutely. 
  I mean, it's gorgeous. 
  And everything you need's there. 
  I'm going to have to take one for the team, ain't I? 
  I'm going to do something that I never thought I'd have to do. 
  What? 
  I'm going to pawn the ring. 
  God, no. 
  Yeah. 
  Shh. 
  It's for the cause, all right? 
  It's our destiny.

  I want it all in cash. 
  Yeah, that's not real gold, mate. 
  Of course it's real gold. 
  What you talking about? 
  It's also really bent, so, sorry, we wouldn't be able to accept that. 
  What? 
  Grindah wouldn't wear fake gold, mate. 
  Yeah, exactly. 
  You could definitely say that's gold, mate, trust me. 
  Yeah. 
  I've sold a lot of things less gold than that, you idiot. 
  Come on, let's get out of here. 
  What about this one? 
  Bless you, Steve, mate, they wouldn't want that tat. 
  No, not the whistle, the This one. 
  This would be OK. 
  Isn't that your nan's ring? 
  Yeah, but I feel like maybe this is why she gave it to me in a way. 
  Yeah, exactly, she was a big fan of Kurupt FM, so She moved out for it. 
  Yeah, sell it. 
  Sell it. 
  Yeah, that's good.

  Are you worried about having to move to Essex? 
  Yeah, I am worried about Essex. 
  But, obviously, we're going to just have to live there now cos I can't even get through to someone to sort it out, so that's it.

  How many of those do you have at the moment? 
  We've only got the best MC in the galaxy, we ain't really got any equipment at the moment. 
  But we're working on that. 
  Let's get the f*ck out of here. 
  Decks! 
  Watch it, watch it. 
  Speaker! 
  OK, and turn. 
  Spud me! 
  Essex is a piss take, Miche. 
  They shouldn't be allowed to move you that far, you know that? 
  I know, I literally don't know what to do. 
  Yeah. 
  Do you remember that bin man? 
  Charlie, yeah? 
  A couple of years ago I used to go with. 
  Yeah, smelt funny, yeah. 
  Yeah, well he knows someone who knows one of the councillors, right? 
  He might be able to pull a few strings for you. 
  Anything for my girl, you know that. 
  I don't want you to shag a bin man so I can stay in Brentford, Mum. 
  Don't you knock a bin man. 
  I've had quite a few in my time and they're all right. 
  They scrub up OK, they really do. 
  I miss this place! 
  You seen the new layout? 
  f*cking hell, Steves, it's a complete shithole in here. 
  You don't like it? 
  Grindah's not going to like this. 
  I thought we could just try it like this just cos I've got the furniture how I No, we need to be exactly how it used to be, Steves. 
  Is it? 
  What have you done? 
  I was trying to do like a sort of feng shui thing, like, get the ambience of the room just right sort of thing. 
  It's good for the mind, apparently. 
  Yeah. 
  Right, let's go get the other bits. 
  Are you worried about having Kurupt FM back in your flat? 
  Yeah, I am a bit worried about it. 
  But, yeah, Grindah said, unfortunately, it has to be at my flat. 
  Steve, come on. 
  Cos he can't be f*cked to find anywhere else. 
  Yeah, it's feeling better already. 
  She's got to get dealt with. 
  When you try and tell me what to do, like, then obviously I'm going to put you in your place, straight up, like, do you know what I'm saying? 
  Really? 
  Every time. 
  Obviously, man's MC Grindah out here, you don't become the best MC in the galaxy just by taking sh1t off people, yeah?

  Pretend to be Daddy. 
  OK, erm "Hello". 
  We're moving to Essex. 
  What? 
  So we have to leave our home and all of our friends and family behind. 
  Miche, don't do that. 
  So, everything you love is gone now. 
  What, Carly? 
  Daddy doesn't know Carly, it doesn't matter, does it? 
  But I won't see her any more! 
  Well, Daddy wouldn't say that, would he? 
  Yeah, he's going to be devastated because he basically owns Brentford, in a way, like. 
  He's built up this reputation here and it's just going to be completely shattered. 
  He's going to have to start again. 
  It might take years for him to be as respected, as important there as he is here. 
  Yes, yes. 
  What's going on? 
  Good, yeah? 
  Kurupt FM is back, yeah? 
  No-one can hold us down. 
  Never! 
  So, for this, I say, three, two, one! 
  We've put in way too much time to f*cking stop doing this now, innit? 
  Bruv, trust me, like!

  You all right?. 
  Where's Grindah? 
  Darling! 
  You owe me a lot of bear hugs, do you know that? 
  I am going to bear hug the sh1t out of you later! 
  So, that's our sexy little codeword. 
  When she says bear hug, she actually means s*x. 
  And I need a lot of bear hugs, don't I, baby? 
  Do you want me to bear hug your nanny later on, Angel? 
  Mamma! 
  I know what it means. 
  Right, I think she's figured out the code. 
  She has, yeah. 
  I'll switch it up. 
  Never replies to my messages. 
  I'm living the dream, right now, do you know what I'm saying, like? 
  Yeah. 
  I've got goals. 
  If you've got goals, you don't need a job. 
  If you know where your dreams are, you don't need to live in reality. 
  You're not picking up.
