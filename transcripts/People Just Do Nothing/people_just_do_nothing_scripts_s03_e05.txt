 Roche? 
  - Mmm? 
  - Do you need your passport if you're going to Ipswich? 
  Only if you're going via France. 
  Right. 
  I'll have to double-check with Chabudds, because we might need them for the tolls up north. 
  This is our first out-of-town gig and it's my first gig as their manager, so I need to prove that I'm Hold on. 
  I need to prove that I'm . . worth it. 
  But no, in all seriousness, like, the boys have put their trust in me and I can't let them down. 
  We basically couldn't be f*cked to sort it all out, so we just let Chabudds do it, really. 
  Yeah, like, we've got to focus just on the performance, it's our first nationwide tour, so - Spreading the seed. 
  - Yeah. 
  Lyrically. 
  And literally as well, innit? 
  Yeah. 
  Big night, big night. 
  Tonight is going to be quite the test with all the bloody groupie action. 
  Sweet. 
  Good to go. 
  Oh, I've only bloody forgot the condoms, didn't I? 
  Some breakfast So, have you and Grindah broken up? 
  No, we haven't broken up, I'm just giving him some time to think about what he really wants and, you know, think about all the things that he's been taking for granted. 
  And in the meantime, you know, it gives me a chance to get to know who Miche really is. 
  Some Miche time. 
  You all right? 
  Oh, we're out of milk, mate. 
  Oh, is there not enough left for me? 
  No, I like it really milky. 
  Urgh, you having it dry? 
  - I can't wait. 
  - Yeah, same. 
  Jinx. 
  Oh, hold on. 
  Oh, mate, he's here. 
  - Yes! 
  - Come on. 
  - Come on, let's go. 
  You seen this? 
  Our very own tour van. 
  This is the official Kurupt FM tour bus. 
  - Brother. 
  - Yeah. 
  - Smashed it. 
  I've designated a driver as well, so Decoy, alley-oop, my brother. 
  OK? 
  And boys, for you, I've installed a state-of-the-art sound system. 
  Oh, yes! 
  We love music! 
  Customised interior as well. 
  How long is the tour going to be, then? 
  Put it this way, yeah, one leg naturally follows another. 
  - Oh, is there a second? 
  - There's not a second, just - So, yeah. 
  - Loads of shows. 
  At the moment it's just one booking, but, yeah. 
  You never know, on the way back from We might find somewhere. 
  Look at that! 
  Personalised window plate. 
  No photos, cos we're famous. 
  - f*ck off! 
  - I love travelling. 
  What? 
  It stinks. 
  Steves, have you been sick already? 
  I got a delicate system, innit? 
  If you're going to be sick constantly, then get into the back so I don't see or smell you. 
  - Come on. 
  - Looks like he's bleeding as well. 
  - Shoo! 
  Out, get out. 
  - It's worse in the back for me. 
  - Just get out. 
  My job on tour is to a) DJ, b) keep up the vibe, and c) try not to be sick in the car. 
  How do you think you will do on those? 
  Uh Good on the first two, not so good on the last one. 
  Get in. 
  - See you later, mate. 
  - Comfy as well. 
  Oh, mate! 
  This is going to be incredible! 
  You all right, Miche? 
  Oh, yeah, no, I'm fine. 
  Thank you. 
  It's just you been shampooing her hair for about 20 minutes, so God, yeah. 
  No, it's just She had very dirty hair, so I just, yeah Getting it all cleaned up. 
  Have you spoke to Grindah? 
  No, not yet. 
  Sometimes the most powerful thing you can say is nothing at all. 
  Is that a quote? 
  Yeah. 
  It's from one of my favourite memes. 
  Oh, mate, follow that sign. 
  - The North. 
  - The North. 
  - f*ck, this is proper like We're in the jungle right now. 
  Yeah. 
  Look at that, it's like the bloody Serengeti. 
  This is actually the most amount of green I've ever seen. 
  And are you excited about the tour? 
  He hasn't stopped banging on about it. 
  No, I can't wait to go travelling, yeah. 
  Yeah. 
  First time leaving the manor and that, yeah, it's going to be sick. 
  Yeah, yeah, yeah. 
  But proper leaving, like motorway-leaving. 
  Yeah, yeah, do you know what I mean? 
  # Hype n a riddim # When I wake up I'm gonna blaze them, blaze them, # Cos I look like Jason Statham, # Lyrically I helter-skelter, Cos physically I'm Idris Elba.

  - Crisps. 
  Come on. 
  Services. 
  I'm about to get serviced. 
  Oh, mate. 
  Remember, stay in the budget, yeah? 
  You reckon they've got different flavoured crisps up north? 
  - Only time will tell. 
  After you. 
  - Thank you. 
  Joke. 
  Straight off the bat, I'm having them. 
  Soup? 
  Who eats soup? 
  - Oh - All right mate? 
  What's that smell? 
  I just I'll clean it up later. 
  It's fine. 
  I didn't have breakfast, it's mainly just spit. 
  Is this Ipswich? 
  Grindah. 
  They've got a coffee machine. 
  - What? 
  - Where you can make your own coffee. 
  I don't even like coffee, but I'm going to have one because it looks sick. 
  - I'm going to have one as well. 
  - Yeah, have a go. 
  - It's a computer. 
  - Yeah, I know.

  That's f*cking mental. 
  That is sick. 
  Hey, Decoy. 
  We're not twins, you know that? 
  Go on, what am I thinking right now? 
  Dunno. 
  I was thinking how great it is that we are on our first lads' holiday together.

  How much is it? 
  It's Ã£43 for that stuff and Ã£20 for the petrol. 
  Ã£43? 
  You know, it can be expensive being a manager, you know what I mean? 
  There's loads of expenses, and obviously you need to front, you know, the cash for your artistes, you know. 
  I'm willing to do that, because I know that it's going to come back tenfold, you know what I mean? 
  You like gold? 
  No, I need cash, man. 
  You pay the Ã£43. 
  You melt this down.

  Who likes house music? 
  Yeah. 
  Is it? 
  Well, f*ck off and get out. 
  - You lot get out. 
  - Who said that?! 
  House music is disgusting, yeah. 
  I tell you why as well, yeah. 
  It's not only the music, yeah. 
  But it's the type of people that listen to it. 
  Chabudds, check that guy there. 
  Get him. 
  Stand behind me. 
  Hold me back, man. 
  f*ck that little prick. 
  - Yeah, yeah, you better deal with him. 
  - Tell him I'm going to fight him. 
  - Tell him I'm going to fight him. 
  - Do you want me to hold you back? 
  Like, just disgusting freaks with, like, sleeve tattoos and f*cking women's jeans on and that. 
  They spend more time at the gym than actually doing stuff. 
  Do you know what I mean? 
  Yeah. 
  With, like, shaved ball bags. 
  Yeah, exactly. 
  Does anyone want another drink?

  - We love each other. 
  - Oh, yeah. 
  Yeah. 
  - Hi. 
  - Let's have a little dance, Tanya.

  One! 
  Two-two! 
  Whack! 
  Right over the head. 
  - OK. 
  - And he would've been out. 
  Yeah, I did tell you tour life gets a bit mental, but it's all part and parcel, innit, do you know what I mean? 
  Yeah. 
  What happened with the groupies? 
  You said it was going to pick up. 
  Yeah, sorry, I know it's been a bit of a weird one. 
  - Do you want some coke? 
  - What? 
  You're doing coke? 
  - Steves! 
  - Steves! 
  - Yes, bruv! 
  This place is f*cking long to get to, man.

  Where have you lot gone? 
  I'm still here, so if you just come back, get out your house. 
  I love you. 
  Bye, Mum. 
  Oh, no. 
  I called you Mum. 
  I was told Kurupt FM were going to sell out the venue, but there's no-one here, there's no money in the till, so I can't pay you. 
  You didn't market it right, mate. 
  I tell you what, mate, you're brownlisted. 
  Idiot. 
  Listen, mate, I got some bad news, all right. 
  Basically, the promoter didn't make enough money to pay us the fee, OK? 
  What? 
  So, he's going to pay us as soon as his student loan comes through, so Nah, bruv, this whole f*cking thing's been a joke, right. 
  I know. 
  If I don't get my money now, I'm going to go f*cking schiz. 
  No, please don't, mate.
