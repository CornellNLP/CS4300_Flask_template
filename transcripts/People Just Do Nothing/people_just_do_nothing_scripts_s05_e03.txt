 Steves, 20 B&H, blue, slim Rizla. 
  And a can of Coke as well. 
  And I need change for Roche. 
  All right. 
  Wait, wait. 
  Three, two, one, go! 
  Oh, mate, we've invented this new game since Steve got the tag, right. 
  It's so joke. 
  It's joke. 
  Do you think he's going to make it? 
  Hopefully not. 
  Basically, he's got to be in by 8pm or he gets in better trouble. 
  Yeah, so, at 7. 
  50 exactly, we send him to the shop with a fat list and he has to get back before his curfew. 
  Cos if he doesn't make it back, he'll have to go to jail. 
  Idiot! 
  LAUGHTER I'll take the stairs. 
  Yeah, no, it's jokes. 
  But you did it. 
  Oh Jokes. 
  Where is he? 
  Where is he? 
  There he is! 
  Stevie! 
  Go on, Stevie! 
  Go on, Steve! 
  Come on, Stevie! 
  Go on, Stevie! 
  Quick, quick! 
  THEY CHANT: Stevie! 
  Stevie! 
  Oh, sh1t, f*ck! 
  STEVES GROANS Steves! 
  You all right, mate? 
  THEY CHEER Go on, Steves, straight into the shop, mate. 
  f*cking hell, that's the best one yet. 
  I've never seen anyone smash into a car. 
  No.

  Go on, Steves! 
  Come on, mate! 
  THEY CHANT: Stevie!

  Well, minus points for getting hit by a car, so work on your technique for next time. 
  Yeah. 
  All right? 
  KNOCK ON DOOR WOMAN SHOUTS What's up? 
  No, I'll be back soon. 
  Day one of the shoot. 
  Why do we wait a year before making a music video? 
  I wonder why. 
  So do I. 
  It's called creating a hype, mate. 
  Yeah, it's called being strategic. 
  Exactly. 
  Plus having a webcam made me realise that my looks are wasted on radio. 
  Yeah, and Chabzi can get loads of free cameras and sh1t from work, so That's probably the main reason, to be fair. 
  Amazing what they can do now, isn't it? 
  Yeah. 
  With the technology. 
  Sorry, are you looking for a radio? 
  Probably, yeah, could be. 
  Or whatever that stuff is there. 
  Come on, Steves. 
  I'm filming it, directing it, everything. 
  I'm doing my own lighting. 
  I'm doing special effects. 
  He's doing special effects. 
  There's going to be a lot of explosions as well. 
  Yeah, shitloads of explosions, fire. 
  Is it? 
  Yeah, I can do that. 
  Mad. 
  Titanic kind of sh1t. 
  f*cking hell! 
  I've got some props to make it rain. 
  There we go, Stevie. 
  Just wait Yeah. 
  And in the films, they actually use Bruv In the films, they actually use water and milk cos it shows up better on camera. 
  And that's Oh, wow, what is that? 
  That's the skin. 
  That's great. 
  Right, let's demo it. 
  OK. 
  And action. 
  STEVES CHOKES Oh, God! 
  HE RETCHES That's grim, man. 
  Oh, it stinks! 
  Oh, it's in my mouth. 
  HE SPITS Right, OK, let's make a music video. 
  Eurgh! 
  Let's make it rain. 
  Whassup, boys? 
  Oh, wow, that is a strong look. 
  Do you like that, yeah? 
  Mm. 
  Yeah, I've gone for a doctor, sort of Jean-Claude Van Damme look. 
  Yeah. 
  Van Damme-age. 
  Yeah, the music video's actually going to be inspired by sort of action films/ doctors/ the Fast And Furious franchise. 
  the Fast And Furious franchise. 
  Grab a couple of slices here. 
  It's good to carb up before I shoot. 
  What are you doing today? 
  I said I'd go to Essex with Miche cos I feel a bit sorry for her having to do everything on her own, you know. 
  What's going on in Essex? 
  Has she still not told him? 
  Told him what? 
  For f*ck's sake, I don't want to be caught in the middle of this. 
  Why, what's going on, Roche? 
  Nothing, nothing's going on. 
  What, is Miche thinking about leaving Grindah again? 
  Cos if she is, I'll go f*cking sick. 
  You know he's the ultimate man. 
  No, no, it's not that. 
  Can you sit down? 
  Cos I want you fainting like you did when I told you that Craig was going to university. 
  f*cking hell, that looks I didn't think I could look any better. 
  I know, it's mad, isn't it? 
  I don't usually wear make-up but cos it's a music video shoot, it's sort of allowed. 
  Make sure you bring out the cheekbones for the camera. 
  Yeah, course, I'll do your jawline as well. 
  Yeah, definitely. 
  Turn your head. 
  Mmmm. 
  So, listen, I'm actually going to go and see a flat today. 
  What? 
  Concentrate on me, please. 
  Yeah, but I just want to talk about where it is. 
  Miche, do you want your husband leaving the house without a jawline or not? 
  No, sorry. 
  No, exactly, focus on the task at hand, thank you. 
  HE SIGHS You remember how Miche and Grindah have got to move out of their block, yeah, cos they're knocking them down? 
  Yeah. 
  OK, so, they've got to move. 
  Yeah. 
  Yeah, so, they're moving to Essex. 
  Cool. 
  Yeah? 
  What, permanently or? 
  Permanently, yeah. 
  Yeah. 
  Cool. 
  Can we move to Essex? 
  No f*cking way. 
  Cool. 
  Is that it? 
  Yeah, that's it. 
  Cool. 
  You all right? 
  Yeah. 
  Forgot my sandwich. 
  Just remember, don't say anything to Grindah, OK? 
  Cos it's not up to you. 
  Don't get caught up in it. 
  Yeah. 
  Just let Miche do that. 
  DOOR SHUTS And action. 
  TOGETHER: Ra! 
  This is dead MC on the floor Who's that standing above him? 
  Open your mouth. 
  He's got a microphone and he's pointing it in this direction I think it might be MC Grindah Who? 
  MC Grindah Hats on. 
  Bang! 
  Lyrical blow to the jaw Bang! 
  Lyrical blow to the jaw Stevie, I need you on the floor now ASAP. 
  Come on, quickly. 
  Right, Steves, go inside, help Chabud. 
  This is f*cking important today, man. 
  I'm not going to let Grindah move to Essex. 
  We're going to bang out a sick music video and that's going to solve all our problems. 
  How you feeling? 
  You all right? 
  Yeah, good man. 
  f*cking sick, innit? 
  If it all goes to plan, you can probably buy a house off this, innit. 
  Buy whatever I f*cking want, mate, know what I mean, if this pops off. 
  'Cos they say that money can't buy you happiness. 
  ' Well, that's complete bullshit, because money CAN buy you happiness, you just have to be able to afford it. 
  Yeah, probably get a f*cking rooftop pool as well if I want to. 
  Rooftop pool? 
  Yeah, yeah. 
  Like a little clubhouse, know what I mean? 
  Yeah. 
  Next scene. 
  What's going on? 
  Yeah, let's go. 
  He's inspired me. 
  Let's do it. 
  What? 
  Basically, he said that we can't film in here. 
  Said the permission slip didn't come through. 
  I faxed him but So what the f*ck are you going to do, you donkey? 
  OK, fine, you know what? 
  I've got everything I want on here, I've got everything, so let's improvise. 
  Follow me, I know what I'm doing. 
  The whole video's based in a hospital. 
  Nick a wheelchair. 
  Yeah, take that. 
  That's good for props. 
  Only I'm allowed in it, only I'm allowed in it. 
  That's improvising. 
  Let's go, guys. 
  Everything's going to be all right. 
  What? 
  Yeah, I'm just saying, I'm excited. 
  Yeah, yeah. 
  Can I use the wheelchair? 
  No, Steve. 
  Where's Brentford then? 
  So, Brentford's down here. 
  Brentford. 
  And then Pitsea. 
  East. 
  Pitsea Where is it? 
  Pitsea's up there. 
  Where? 
  Pitsea Where? 
  I can't see it. 
  That one? 
  Yeah, it's off the end. 
  It's not on the map? 
  Well, it is on A map, it's just not on this one. 
  What other map is there? 
  Well, a bigger one that goes further out. 
  INTERVIEWER: Are you worried about the move to Essex? 
  'Yeah, I am worried but I've got a tiny bit of hope 'that maybe it will be a good thing. 
  ' Maybe it will be nice, sort of like a holiday where you never come home. 
  It's a lot of like farm, isn't it, a lot of green? 
  Very green, yeah. 
  Yeah. 
  Yeah, it's really green. 
  That's better - houses. 
  I'm worried about all the trees and that, cos Grindah really hates countryside. 
  Still not told him then? 
  I was going to tell him but he was in the zone, you know? 
  They're taking the music video really seriously, aren't they? 
  I know, yeah. 
  Kevin was wearing a sleeveless doctor's outfit. 
  Was he? 
  Wow! 
  It all seemed very professional. 
  Yeah, no, God, it's such a powerful concept. 
  What's the concept? 
  Fighting in a hospital? 
  Yeah, but then the hospital is actually a metaphor for society, apparently. 
  Of course it is. 
  Let's go. 
  So, what are we doing in the park? 
  This is my storyboard. 
  This is the second location, right? 
  Looks a little bit like the back of the hospital as well, so perfect. 
  Sick. 
  Don't worry about it. 
  Come on. 
  No, it's good. 
  'I think the best directors, they always have to improvise, you know what I mean? 
  Mate, listen, I'm a visionary. 
  ' I'm Chabuddy G, AKA Steven Spielgirth. 
  So, Stevie, what I want you to do, OK, you're going to be playing the character of the dead MC. 
  So, I'm just going to wear the MC hat. 
  OK. 
  Look at that, it suits him, doesn't it? 
  Are you sure it's tight enough? 
  Right, OK. 
  Stevie, you're down there. 
  Grindah, I need that one. 
  I'm the director. 
  Well, I say action then. 
  No, I'll say it. 
  You can say it with me.

  And TOGETHER: Action! 
  You just stay there. 
  Yeah. 
  'I want to say my directing style is quite unorthodox, 'know what I mean? 
  But also orthodox. 
  'I'd say it's complex but also very simple. 
  ' Erm I'd say it's dark, it's light, it's Yin, it's Yang. 
  It's, er It's everything and it's nothing. 
  Bang! 
  Lyrical blow to the jaw Bang!

  Might be a bit confusing. 
  Oh, yeah, right. 
  I'll just stand out here and face the wall then. 
  No, you don't need to do that, hon.

  OK, and action! 
  Nice. 
  THEY RAP OVER MUSIC TRACK Get the nipple away from my ear.

  Yeah, a studio. 
  Convert one of the rooms into a studio for me. 
  It's nice, Miche. 
  I can really see you lot living here. 
  Could you get a picture of me with the dishwasher? 
  'Obviously, steam room. 
  You'd love a steam room for your skin, 'cos you went once' when you want to the hotel. 
  I came out and my skin was to die for. 
  Yeah, glowing. 
  We want to have, like, a massive kitchen. 
  Glass cupboards so you can see all my things. 
  Yeah, that's nice. 
  Like a museum of your stuff. 
  Yeah, that's sick, yeah. 
  Is this bigger than our bedroom? 
  It's hard to tell, isn't it? 
  I dunno, I've never been in your bedroom. 
  Bed's probably that size. 
  Yeah, that's about it, really. 
  Just loads of space. 
  Maybe a slide from one of the floors to another. 
  If it's a dream house. 
  Yeah, mansion. 
  Obviously, a mansion is everyone's dream house. 
  Yeah, slide into bed. 
  Modern-day mansion. 
  So just before bed every night, you've got a bit of fun. 
  The countryside, eh? 
  Yeah. 
  So peaceful. 
  OK, let's travel to the green screen, Stevie, please. 
  Thank you, travelling.

  I know. 
  Look at the bottom bit.

  You've got a bloody cankle. 
  I know. 
  That's f*cked up. 
  Oh, sh1t, f*cking hell! 
  It stinks. 
  Kind of jokes, innit. 
  No, no-one wants to see that sh1t, that's disgusting. 
  Boys, ain't nobody else thinking what I'm thinking right now? 
  Where do you take someone that's injured? 
  I've just thought of something! 
  Cos of his ankle, we can go to the hospital. 
  Stevie! 
  Yeah? 
  You should have said earlier! 
  THEY SHOU Come on!

  My brother! 
  THEY TALK EXCITEDLY OVER EACH OTHER Come on, Stevie. 
  BEATS RAPS: Someone take him to A&E And perform some lyrical surgery.

  Do I have to have surgery? 
  Let's hope so, Stevie mate, let's hope so. 
  Yes! 
  When's the next train then? 
  Er, about 20 minutes, so there's one every half an hour. 
  One every half an hour? 
  Yeah. 
  Two an hour? 
  Yeah. 
  That is mental. 
  Yeah. 
  The journey's not that long though, I guess. 
  I feel like it took forever. 
  Won't tell Grindah how long it is for now.
