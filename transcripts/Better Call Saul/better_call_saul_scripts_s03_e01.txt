 03x01 - Mabel  
  Previously on AMC's "Better Call Saul"... 
  I just got Mesa Verde back. 
  Paige, the filing didn't go through. 
  There's some regulatory issues. 
  - Everyone makes mistakes. 
  - This was no mistake. 
  He fabricated evidence?  
  - You wanna talk about this?  
  - Not ever.

  Major Theodore "Fudge" Talbot. 
  For a war hero, I think we can bend the rules a wee bit. 
  You do realize you just confessed to a felony. 
  I did it for Kim. 
  It's your word against mine.

  You most certainly are. 
  Look.

  Oh, my God. 
  "The Adventures of Mabel."  
  I-I haven't thought about this in forever. 
  - You remember this, Chuck?  
  - I do. 
  - Harry Thurston Peck. 
  - Yeah! Mabel goes into the mountain, and she meets the King of the Brownies, and he gives her... 
  some kind of super delicious jelly and... 
  [Sighs, clears throat] 
  Holy crap. . 
  Yeah. 
  Belonged to Grammie Davenport. 
  She wrote her name in it. 
  She was reading that to her schoolkids the year the Titanic went down. 
  Damn. 
  And Mom read it to me. 
  I read it to you. 
  [Sighs] 
  You don't remember. 
  Yeah, yeah. 
  I do, now that you say it. 
  Yeah. 
  What was I... like or ?  
  You had this weird night-light that you were so crazy about. 
  It was, um... 
  - It was Daffy Duck!  
  - It was some Daffy Duck rip-off... 
  - ... with this weird red... bill. 
  - Mouth. 
  - Oh, yeah, yeah, the bill. 
  Yeah. 
  - Yeah. 
  Yeah, yeah, yeah. 
  And it used to get so hot, we thought it would burn the house down, but... 
  - [Chuckling] 
  Right. 
  - ... you wouldn't let anybody touch it. 
  Yeah, that's a... 
  You got a great memory, Chuck. 
  That red bill and everything. 
  Hey. 
  [Snaps fingers] 
  What was the name of that little girl that lived, uh, three houses up from us?  
  - She had, like, a pageboy haircut. 
  - Jimmy. 
  And she was always in the dirt, always dirty. 
  - Jimmy! Jimmy! - I liked her. 
  She was always... 
  Don't think I'll ever forget what happened here today. 
  [Clock ticking] 
  And you will pay. 
  [Foil crinkling] 
  You didn't mention my garden. 
  Well, your garden is part of your backyard, so it's automatically included in the property that goes to Jenn. 
  It comes with the house, Mom. 
  Well, I think you need to mention it by name in case some dirty judge decides to play tricks. 
  Okay, we can do that. 
  [Pen clicks] 
  Let's see. 
  Garden.

  - Hey, I'm back. 
  Oh, hi, ladies. 
  Jimmy McGill. 
  Hey, Jimmy. 
  We are almost done here. 
  - Great. 
  Can I, uh... 
  - We're almost done. 
  I'll be with you in a minute. 
  Oh. 
  And mention my lily pond. 
  It's in my garden. 
  Lily pond. 
  [Indistinct conversation in distance] 
  - [Door opens] 
  - Kim: Okay, ladies. 
  Jenn: Thanks so much for your help. 
  Oh, you're very welcome. 
  Thank you both for being so patient. 
  And, Mrs. 
  Aherne, if you or Margaret ever need anything from me... 
  anything at all... 
  you can call me day or night. 
  This is Mrs. 
  Siemasko and her daughter Jenn. 
  I'm sorry. 
  I got my wires crossed a little. 
  - Uh... 
  - Bye. 
  - Mrs. 
  Siemasko: Bye. 
  Thank you. 
  - Drive safe. 
  Okay, thank you. 
  [Latch clicks] 
  You are a superhero. 
  I owe you big-time. 
  [Sighs] 
  [Sighs] 
  So, how's Chuck? Crisis averted... 
  I guess. 
  I mean, he's back to being  
  - the same old Chuck, so... 
  - [Sighs] 
  Wanna talk about it? Depends. 
  It may or may not involve...that thing you said you never, ever wanted to discuss. 
  Um. 
  Okay, then, thanks. 
  I gotta get back to it. 
  How 'bout we call it a day? I'll buy you some dinner. 
  You're kidding, right? You realize how far behind I am? 
  Not to mention now I've got eight entire wills to finish up. 
  Whaddya talking about? I'll do the wills. 
  - No, you won't. 
  - 'Course I will. 
  Do the wills. 
  They're my clients. 
  They're my clients. 
  You and I aren't partners, remember?  
  Once I take these people on, I can't just reassign them to you. 
  Aw, c'mon. 
  Why you getting all, like, legal on me, huh? Who cares? 
  Look, I told every single one of them the situation... 
  that they'd be getting me instead of you. 
  I tried to talk them all into coming back another day. 
  Six of 'em left. 
  Maybe you'll get those back. 
  I mean, look, if this is about the money, I have... 
  It's not about the money. 
  You can keep the money. 
  Don't act like I wanted this. 
  Jesus, like I need more on my plate. 
  Are you mad? I'm not mad. 
  I'm just, uh... 
  thinking about things. 
  For minutes today, Chuck didn't hate me. 
  [Scoffs] 
  I forgot what that felt like. 
  [Sighs] 
  Chuck: Jimmy. 
  You do realize you just confessed to a felony? Jimmy: I guess. 
  But you feel better, right? Besides, it's your word against mine. 
  That's the end of it. 
  Howard?  
  - That's the end. 
  - Mm. 
  - [Tape recorder clicks] 
  - [Dog barks in distance] 
  Could you...? Oh, yeah. 
  Well, now do you believe me? I don't even know where to begin. 
  But yes, I believe you. 
  Your brother is one world-class son of a bitch. 
  No offense. 
  I just... 
  I really wish you'd told me about these plans of yours before you went out and did it. 
  I know, Howard, and I regret misleading you. 
  It's just that a certain... 
  vérité had to be established. 
  I'm not talking about the heart attack that you nearly gave me. 
  Chuck, this tape... 
  I'm not sure exactly what it accomplishes. 
  Look, you know evidentiary rules better than I do, but a secretly recorded tape with a problematic chain of evidence?  
  You're gonna have a helluva time getting that admitted. 
  I agree. 
  And if you somehow put it in front of a jury, Jimmy'd call a dozen audio experts, say that voice isn't his, say the... 
  the tape had been edited. 
  He would, indeed. 
  Are you thinking about playing this for Kevin Wachtell at Mesa Verde? 
  Because as much as I would love to, that ship has sailed. 
  We're never getting them back, regardless. 
  Oh, I doubt we could even get in the door over there. 
  Chuck, if that tape is useless in a court of law and no help in the court of public opinion, what's the point? 
  Because I can't think of a single use for it. 
  I can.

  Who do we have next?  
  [Sighs] 
  That'd be me. 
  Hello, hello. 
  It's so good to see you again. 
  I escorted you and your clients onto my base. 
  I treated you with hospitality and respect, and now I come to find every word out of your mouth is a damn lie. 
  Captain, please. 
  Why don't... 
  Sit down. 
  Take a load off. 
  Hey, I'll get you a complimentary coffee or a soft drink? And your so-called war hero, "Fudge" Talbott? No such person... 
  never was. 
  Granted, some artistic license may have been taken. 
  You entered government property under false pretenses, sir. 
  Whoa, whoa. 
  I am no expert on your procedures and your protocols and whatnot, so if... 
  if we failed to cross a "t" or dot an "i," I sincerely apologize for any misunderstanding. 
  N-no, no, no, it's not a misunderstanding! Just step back! B-big picture this, okay?!  
  - It... 
  - What damage was done?! Hey, who was hurt, huh? What was damaged? The... 
  the base is still there, right? The B- is, I presume, still... 
  - B- . 
  - Huh? B- . 
  FIFI's a B- . 
  [Chuckling] 
  I don't... 
  Oh, this is all just one big joke to you, huh?  
  - You don't like the commercial. 
  - No, no, I don't, but this has nothing to do with the comm... 
  Well, constructive criticism is always welcome. 
  - But I didn't... 
  - But you should realize... 
  ... that most people find it uplifting... 
  - ... patriotic, even. 
  - No. 
  - You check your recruiting numbers. 
  - I-I-I... 
  I think you're gonna see an uptick, and you know what? 
  If it turns out that Fudge wasn't actually in the war... 
  Fudge is not a person. 
  He wasn't in the war. 
  Well, neither was Tom Cruise, and look what "Top Gun" did for you. 
  You lied to me, you lied to my face, and I can't let you get away with it. 
  I-I think we just... 
  we're just gonna have to agree to disagree, so, uh, can I get you that coffee to go or...? No, no. 
  I-I'm gonna tell you what's happening now. 
  You're gonna take that ad off the air. 
  And if you play that ad one more time, I'm gonna go to the Judge Advocate, and we will take you down... 
  trespassing, false representation, stolen valor... 
  the whole nine yards. 
  Seriously, for eight seconds of a TV commercial? You take that ad down, or there'll be hell to pay. 
  That clear enough for you? Make me. 
  - Yeah?  
  - [Chuckling] 
  Yeah. 
  - Make you?  
  - Yeah, let's do this. 
  You bring your commander down here, and I'll explain to him how you let us on the base, red-carpet treatment. 
  No, b-because you lied your way in. 
  - Not how I remember it. 
  - What happened... 
  And I've got witnesses to back me up. 
  Do you like being an Air Force Captain, huh? 
  You think the United States wants to bring action against an old man in a wheelchair?! He was standing on TV. 
  - He wasn't even in a wheelchair!  
  - Well, yeah. 
  Well, periodically, he is. 
  And when he shows up in court, you better believe he'll be in a wheelchair! Right, because you're an ambulance-chasing piece of sh1t, 'cause you're all the same... 
  you're the same as all the others. 
  Always on a high horse. 
  Always trying to make me feel like I'm...

  You moved it up almost three weeks.

  Ernesto, could you come in here, please?  
  [Sighs] 
  Thought I could do this myself. 
  [Chuckles] 
  Uh, would you mind, uh, changing the batteries?  
  - Sure thing, Mr. McGill. 
  - Yeah. 
  Thanks. 
  Jimmy: I changed to . 
  - It was me. 
  - Turn that off!  
  - Turn it off! - 
  Jimmy: It all went down... 
  - Turn it off!  
  - ... exactly... 
  - [Button clicks] 
  - Aah! You did not hear that! 
  [Sighs] 
  All right. 
  Okay, Ernesto... 
  [stuttering] 
  that's my fault, not yours. 
  Um, but now that you've heard it, you need to understand something. 
  You know about confidentiality, right? As employees of Hamlin, Hamlin, McGill, you and I are both bound by the strictures of client confidentiality... 
  by law, both of us... 
  by law. 
  You understand what I'm saying?  
  - So I'm not supposed to tell anyone?  
  - That's right. 
  No matter who, no matter what reasons you think you might have, you must not... 
  you cannot tell anyone. 
  There could be terrible consequences... 
  life-changing consequences. 
  [Sighs] 
  And we don't want you to get into trouble. 
  If something were to happen to you because of this, I'd feel sick about it. 
  [Sighs] 
  Okay. 
  Enough said. 
  I guess... 
  I'll go finish puttin' away the groceries. 
  Okay? Thank you, Ernesto.
