 announcer : Previously, on "Better Call Saul." 
 Why did we have to come here? 
 Production value. Showmanship. 
 Jimmy : You ready to sign? Let's do this. 
 Kim : I lost Mesa Verde. 
 Jimmy : What happened? 
 Kim : Sticking with HHM. 
 Kevin got his head turned. 
 Jimmy : By Howard? 
 Kim : No, Chuck. 
 You were fantastic t... Oh. 
 I need an X-Acto knife, a ruler, and point me to your best copier. 
 (truck beeping) 
 What's all this? 
 (whirring) 
 I needed a soaker for the rhododendrons out back.

 Chuck : Okay. All set. 
 Thank you for your patience. 
 Didn't you say that the hearing is more or less a formality? 
 Well, the real work's already been done, yes. 
 In that case, ‭I'm fine covering it myself. 
 Kevin and Paige ‭don't need both of us there. 
 That may be strictly true, but we want to send the right message, don't we? 
 I'm just worried about your comfort. 
 I find victory laps very comforting.

 Well-done, my friend. 
 [Sighing] 
 Good morning. 
 This meeting of the New Mexico State Banking Board is now in session. 
 We have Mesa Verde here with us today, and they're represented by Charles McGill. 
 Nice to have you back, Charles. 
 Thank you. Good to be back. 
 I'm here with my colleague, Howard Hamlin. 
 And may I introduce Mr. Kevin Wachtell, President and Chairman of Mesa Verde Holdings, and Ms. Paige Novick, Mesa Verde Senior Counsel. 
 Hello and welcome. 
 I believe staff has found the application to meet the basic requirements for approval. 
 That's right, isn't it? 
 With your permission, Mr. Wachtell would like to make a brief statement in support of the application. 
 [Clears throat] 
 Mr. Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen of the New Mexico Banking Board, I'm honored and grateful to appear before you this morning. 
 We believe ‭that our proposed expansion is in the public interest both for Arizona and our own state. 
 For 46 years, the men and women of Mesa Verde Bank and Trust have prided ourselves on personal service and attention to detail second to none. 
 Mesa Verde continues to operate at a Tier One leverage ratio of 11.2%, and we feel... 
 Uh, hold on. 
 Excuse me, Mr. Wachtell. Just one moment. 
 [Whispering indistinctly] 
 What's going on? 
 Well, let's find out. 
 Uh, Mr. Commissioner, is there something we can clarify? 
 Uh, yes. 
 Can you give us the address of the proposed Scottsdale branch again? 
 Certainly. 
 It's 1216 Rosella Drive, Scottsdale, Arizona, 85262. 
 1-2-1-6? 
 Okay. 
 Because the application I'm looking at today clearly gives the address as 1216. 
 1216... that's correct, sir. 
 But in the original submission, we're seeing 1261 Rosella Drive. 
 It is 1261. 
 ‭1261. 
 I think if you double-check, you'll see that 1216 is correct. 
 There seem to be ‭two different addresses here. 
 Mr. Commissioner, I have a copy of our notice of intent, which was published in newspapers in Arizona and New Mexico. 
 It clearly states the address is 1261 Rosella Drive. 
 Mr... ‭Mr. Commissioner, I-if... 
 1-2-6-1 Rosella Drive. 
 Yes, I have a copy of the notice of intent, too, but on the actual filing, the address reads 1-2-1-6. 
 So... which is it? 
 Mr. Commissioner, ‭if I may confer with my clients? 
 Commissioner : Certainly, please. 
 It's absolutely 1261. 
 [Sighs] 
 You are mistaken, and with all due respect, you're muddying the waters here. 
 "Muddying the water"? 
 [Sighs] ‭Look. 
 Just look. 
 Well, ‭this is clearly an error. 
 It's 1261. 
 I know where my own damn bank is. 
 Uh, let's just all calm down. I'm sure we can straighten this out. 
 I've got a building remodel at 1261 Rosella. 
 I don't know where the hell 1216 is. 
 I-I don't quite underst... 1261. 
 1261. 
 Is this gonna be a problem? 
 No, I'm sure it won't be. 
 Um, M-Mr. Commissioner, I apologize. 
 Unaccountably, there appears to be a... discrepancy in our filing. 
 So the correct address the one that appeared in the notice of intent, the 1261? 
 It would seem so. 
 Uh, uh, uh, ‭we'd like to request a, um, an adjournment [Chuckling] of just a few minutes so that we can amend the filing to reflect the correct address. 
 Well, I-I can give you an adjournment, uh, uh, but, uh... uh, I don't think we can get you back in today. 
 If I may, when do you think you might be able to schedule us? 
 I'm being told by staff that they've already done the research for 1216 Rosella Drive. 
 Our folks are going to have to go back to square one on the new address. 
 If we... we could d obin a provisional agreement today, to allow the... the branch to open be... 
 No, no. All due respect, it's up to you folks to submit accurate paperwork. 
 Maybe next time, double-check. 
 Now, uh, the soonest we could revisit this matter... well, it... it looks like six weeks from Friday. 
 We... ‭We can't wait six weeks. 
 Mr. Commissioner, M-Mesa Verde has put effort a a... resources into preparing this branch to open immediately. 
 However unusual, a provisional a-approval would be most [Chuckling] appreciated, most welcome. 
 Time being of the essence... 
 Charles, I'm sorry. I'll see you in six weeks. 
 That closes the matter for today. 
 Will staff please note that Mesa Verde will return in six weeks... 
 [Electricity humming] 
 That's on the schedule now. 
 And we'll have expedited a. 
 Chuck : This is not possible. 
 This is not possible! 
 Ohh. 
 Chuck : Ohh. 
 1261. No. No. 
 Chuck. 
 ‭[Papers rustling] 
 I don't understand. 
 [Breathing heavily] 
 I don't understand. It was 1216. 
 It was. I checked! 
 I double-checked! 
 Chuck, it happened. 
 Now we take our licks, and we move on. 
 This doesn't just reflect you... an office full of associates and paralegals let this get by. 
 I did, too, for that matter. 
 It was 1216... I promise you. 
 Everyone makes mistakes. 
 [Breathing deeply] 
 This was no mistake.

 Hey! Hey, listen up, everybody! 
 This gentleman's buyin a round for the house! 
 [All cheer] 
 All right, lift with your kneess. 
 Jimmy : What does the evev mean... "lift with your knees"? 
 I don't know. It's something sweaty people say. Here we go. 
 1, 2, 3. 
 [Both grunting] 
 Got it. Almost. 
 Almost, almost, almost, almost. 
 Got it? ‭AII right. 
 Oh, right there. Go. Go. 
 [Breathing heavily] 
 You okay? 
 Nothin a few years ‭ofhysical therapy won't fix. 
 [Chuckles] ‭Okay. 
 All right. Push. 
 Slow, slow, slow, slow. 
 Corner, corner, corner. 
 [Breathing heavily] 
 Yeah. 
 ‭Get that one. 
 [Cellphone ringing] 
 [Sighs] 
 [Cellphone beeps] 
 Hi, Paige. 
 How are you? 
 Yeah, I mean, no. 
 No, it's fine. 
 Uh-huh. 
 What? 
 Well, yes. [Chuckles] 
 Of course. Right, I understand. 
 Okay. 
 Yeah, that would be perfect. 
 I'll see you then. Great. 
 And, uh, listen, Paige, thank you. 
 Thank you. 
 [Chuckles] 
 I, uh. 
 Jimmy. 
 What? What's up? 
 I, uh... 
 I just got Mesa Verde back. 
 Seriously? 
 ‭Seriououy. [Chuckles] 
 Holy sh1t! That's unbelievable! 
 [Laughing] Yes. 
 [Laughs] 
 I... What happened to HHM? 
 Uh, Paige didn't go into it. 
 She just said ‭the filing didn't go through. 
 We're gonna meet this afternoon. 
 Hey, what did I tell you? 
 Sometimes, the good guys win. 
 [Chuckles] 
 Oh, it sounds like ‭there's some regulatory issues. 
 Kevin's still worried that one lawyer won't be able to handle it. 
 You can. 
 Yeah, I'm gonna have to get a paralegal, maybe two of them, and I absolutely ‭will pay for it out of my end. 
 No. Come on. Split it down the middle. 
 You know what? 
 I need ‭a Westlaw terminal right away. 
 [Chucklins] I don't even know who to call to get that done. 
 These are high-class problems. 
 Yeah, but it's a major piece of work, Jimmy. 
 It's just... It's... It's... This is major. 
 Hey, Kim, you've got this, all right? 
 So take a moment. 
 ‭[Sighs] 
 [Sighs] Breathe. Savor. 
 You know what? You're right. 
 [Chucklins] Damn right I'm right. 
 [Scoffs] 
 [Cellphone ringing] 
 It's Ernie. [Chuckles] 
 [Cellphone beeps] 
 Hi, Ernie. 
 What's up? 
 Yeah, no, Paige just called me. 
 Uh-huh. Did Chuck say why... 
 So, when... 
 Sure. ‭No time like the present. 
 Okay. Thanks. 
 [Cellphone beeps] 
 The Mesa Verde files... 
 Chuck's ready ‭to turn thememveveto me. 
 Wow. [Chuckling] Really? 
 That was... quick. 
 Yeah. 
 Uh, I'm gonna go change and get over there. 
 You want some help? ‭ 
 That depends. 
 Are you gonna carry boxes, or you gonna gloat? 
 Uh, some from column "A," some from column "B." 
 Jimmy : Ground yourself. 
 W... Sorry? 
 [Keys jingling] 
 Just touch the thing. 
 [Doorknob rattling] 
 What the hell? This thing doesn't... 
 Hey, Jimmy. Hey, Kim. ‭ 
 Hey, Ernie. 
 Somethin's wrong with the lock. 
 Mr. McGill had me call a locksmith and change em. 
 [Sighs] 
 Jimmy : Yeah? Why'd he do that? 
 [Door closes] 
 Hey, Chuck, why'd you change the locks? 
 Ernesto, I think we're good. 
 I'm sure you're needed back at the office. 
 Well... I'll get goin, then. 
 Thanks. 
 ‭Bye, Jimmy. Bye, Kim. 
 Bye, Ernie. ‭ 
 Jimmy : See ya, Ernie. 
 So, Chuck, ‭what's the deal with the locks? 
 Kim, I was hoping to have this conversation with you and you alone. 
 However... I guess it's time to clear the air once and for all. 
 Clear the air about what? 
 He sabotaged me. 
 Buddy, what are you, uh... 
 Please. 
 Don't bother. 
 You and I both know ‭exactly what I'm talking about. 
 I don't. 
 Yesterday morning was the worst professional humiliation of my life. 
 A single transpositional error cost my client time and money and permanently damaged my reputation. 
 But then I realized... it wasn't an error. 
 Not at all. [Inhales deeply] 
 A week ago last night, I was right there on that couch, barely cononious, and Jimmy showed up. 
 And he sent Ernesto away. 
 My brother was gonna take care of me. 
 And in the dead of night, he went through my Mesa Verde files. 
 Uh, you know what? We don't have to listen to this. 
 She does! You do... for your own good. 
 Now, in these files are 13 documents containing the address of Mesa Verde's proposed branch... 
 1261 Rosella Drive, Scottsdale, Arizona. 
 Jimmy pulled each and every one, then he left me here, sweating and delirious, while he went off to doctor them. 
 You'd need a photocopier for that. 
 Where'd you go... some all-night copy shop? 
 [Chuckles] 
 With a little careful cutting and pasting, he created duplicates... virtually identical to my originals, but with one key change... 
 1261 Rosella Drive ‭became 1216 Rosella Drive. 
 This is sounding like a lot of work. 
 No one ever accused you of being lazy... every other sin in the book, but not that one. 
 And if you're wondering if Jimmy's up to a little casual forgery, you should know in high school, he had a thrivininbusiness making fake I.D.s ‭so his buddies could buy beer. 
 You going all the way back to high school, huh? 
 [Chuckling] Hey, you and Mozart, huh? 
 You both started young. 
 [Inhales deeply] 
 He came back here and put his new versions in my files. 
 And then, the next day, my caring brother took his leave. 
 He knew that I would use his modified documents to write Mesa Verde's submission to the state regulator. 
 And so I did, over and over... 
 I typed "1216" instead of "1261." 
 I remember thinking, "1216 Rosella Drive... that's just one year after 1215, the year the Magna Carta was signed." 
 Jesus, Chuck, you are unbelievable. 
 So, you're saying, if we look in here, all the addresses will be wrong? 
 Well, of course you weren't gonna leave evidence behind. 
 I'm guessing yesterday morning, you waited until I left, then used your key to let yourself in and return the originals. 
 No crime is complete without the cover-up. 
 Oh, come on. 
 I did all this... what... for some business? 
 [Sighs] 
 He did it for you. 
 [Clock ticking] 
 Oh, I'm sure you didn't know anything about it. 
 I believe he went off on his own and did this as some kind of twisted romantic gesture. 
 Chuck, ‭I think you need to lie down with a cold washcloth on your head. 
 And now that you know, you have no choice. 
 This is about a client... a client who has been defrauded. 
 As a sworn officer of the court, as Mesa Verde's attorney of record, you have no recourue but to go to Kevin Wachtell anmake a full disclosure. 
 This... This whole song and dance... it's all about getting his client back. 
 That's all this is. ‭ 
 Not in the least. 
 If, knowing the truth, they still decide to go... 
 You can't ststanthe fact that they chose her over you. 
 I can't stand the fact that my own brother stabbed me in the back! 
 I can't stand the fact that you've deceived and ruined this fine young woman! 
 "Ruined"? 
 What is this... the 1840s? 
 What are you talking about? She's not ruined! 
 Jimmy. 
 [Clock ticking] 
 If what you're saying is true, Jimmy could be charged with forgery, fraud, falsifying evidence, even breaking and entering. 
 Frankly, I am sick about this. 
 But facts are facts. 
 And what is your evidence? 
 My evidence? 
 My evidence is knowing my brother for his entire life. 
 Chuck, I think ‭there is another explanation... it's a simpler one. 
 You made a mistake. 
 I did not. 
 You're wororking by lantern, squinting over 10-point typepe for hour after hour. 
 Mistakenly changing 1261 to 1216 would be the most natural thing in the world. 
 It could certainly happen to me. 
 I did not make a mistake! 
 I believe you did. 
 Look, I understand that you have a... a great affection for Jimmy. 
 A great many people do, but please open your eyes here! 
 You made a mistake, and instead of just facing up to it, you accuse your brother of plotttting ainst you. 
 You come up ‭with this elaborate scheme. 
 He's capable of this! 
 You know he is! 
 I know he's not perfect! 
 And I know he cuts corners. 
 But you're the one who made him this way. 
 He idolizes you. 
 He accepts you. 
 He takes care of you. 
 And all he ever wanted was your love and support, but all you've ever done is judge him. 
 You never believed in him. 
 You never wanted him to succeed. 
 And you know what? 
 I feel sorry for him. 
 And I feel sorry for you.

 [Indistinct conversations in distance] 
 Excuse me. 
 Hi. Are you in charge here? 
 Yes, I am, ‭and this is school property. 
 You're just the person I want to speak to. 
 It would be incredibly helpful if you could get those kids in that building over there to just keep it down for a bit. 
 Just give 'em a worksheet or something? 
 I mean, just two or three minutes, just for sound. 
 This is school property, and no one is allowed here without permission. 
 Of course not. 
 You didn't speak to Annette? 
 ‭Annette? 
 In the Superintendent's Office. 
 Do you know an Annette downtown? 
 I don't think so. 
 Well, I'm sorry about the mix-up.

 We're shooting what's called an establishing shot... five minutes, tops. 
 You're not shooting anything until I'm clear on what's going on here. 
 The documentary... we're making a documentary. 
 That's... Oh! [Snaps fingers] 
 I was s toldhere was a display or a plaque of some kind. 
 Would you know where that would be? 
 Why would we have a plaque? 
 Because of who went to school here. 
 Who went to school here? 
 Rupert Holmes. 
 That's who the documentary is about. 
 I'm sorry. Who? 
 Rupert Holmes. 
 You know... Rupert Holmes, the singer/songwriter. 
 You know, um... "The Piña Colada Song."

 He still talks about it. 
 But the school was built in '71. 
 Mm. He was a student in the old building that used to be here. 
 We're taking a little... what do you call it?... artistic liberties. 
 Isn't Rupert Holmes English? 
 Well, yeah, ‭and that's some great trivia, but he spent his formative years right here in Albuquerque. 
 I'll tell you what... why don't you call Annette down in ‭the Superintendent's Office? 
 And we'll just stay here till you get official word. 
 Well, ‭if you don't mind waiting. 
 Not at all. 
 We don't want to break any rules. 
 Shouldn't take very long, I'm sure.

 [Van door opens, closes] 
 I've got something I need to know, and I need to know it fast. 
 [Sighs] What's that? 
 Got hit the other day. 
 A truck headed south got hijacked. 
 Someone stole a quarter million. 
 Now Hector's flippin' out, lookin' for who did it. 
 Thing is... 
 I think it was you. 
 They left the driver hog-tied... not a mark on him. 
 Anyone in the game woulda capped him without a second thought. 
 But this driver? He's still breathin'. 
 I thought to myself, "Who's the guy who'll rip off a couple hundred thousand in drug money and leave a witness? 
 Who's the guy ‭who won't pull the trigger?" 
 You. 
 [Sighs] 
 I'm not here to squeeze you. 
 You wanna rip off the cartel, that's your business. 
 But here's the thing. 
 I'm picking up that driver... Hector's orders. 
 We're gonna see what he knows, and if he knows you, that's bad for both of us. 
 That shouldn't concern you. 
 But he was in on it, right? 
 The driver ‭had nothing to do with it. 
 Then who? 
 ‭Just me. 
 You're telling me you did is without someone on the inside? 
 Not possible. 
 How did you know about the truck? 
 How do you know about the tires? 
 All I can tell you is, you guys aren't half as smart as you think you are. 
 So the driver... doesn't know anything? 
 Not a thing. ‭He hear your voice? 
 No. ‭ 
 Right now, Hector's looking at the competition, but he hears the driver say it was some old gringo... 
 He didn't hear me. 
 He saw a guy with a ski mask... that's it. 
 And you're sure of that? 
 Yeah. 
 You better be right. 
 Why wasn't it in the papers? 
 What? 
 The truck robbery... the cops keeping it out of the papers? 
 The cops? 
 The cops don't know sh1t about it. 
 How's that? 
 Is that what this is about? 
 You wanted to put the cops onto Hector? 
 Why? 
 You are nothing to him. 
 He forgot all about you. 
 I haven't forgotten him. 
 You put me in the sh1t, just 'cause you got it in for Hector Salamanca? 
 Listen, you put the cops on him, you put them on me. 
 Doing it for the money... I get it, but this sh1t... that's insane. 
 You need to calm yourself down, and you need to take that hand out of that pocket. 
 [Sighs] 
 Now, just so you know... it's over. 
 I'm done with your boss. 
 [Sighs] Whatever. 
 Why wasn't it in the papers? 
 Because we cleaned it up. 
 How's that? 
 We got lucky. 
 After you left, ‭a Good Samaritan came along and said, "Oh, my God! 
 Oh, my God!" 
 He cut the driver loose. The driver called us. 
 We came out, got the truck. 
 Made it like it never happened. 
 And that Good Samaritan? 
 Hector shot him in the face. 
 We buried the guy out in the desert. 
 Like I said... we cleaned it up. 
 [Van door opens, closes]

 [Van departs] 
 [Car door creaks shut] 
 [Sighs] 
 [Water running] 
 [Water stops] 
 Jimmy : How was your day? 
 Kim : You know, met with Paige and Kevin, interviewed some paralegals... and, uh, this. 
 What about you? [Sighs] 
 Finished the commercial. 
 I don't want to oversell it, but I think it might be the greatest 60 seconds in the history of television. 
 Tomorrow morning, uh, somewhere between 11:18 and 11:35, stop what you're doing and tune in to "Diagnosis Murder." 
 I'll make a point of it. 
 You want to talk about this? 
 Not now. 
 Not ever. 
 I'm just gonna say... you are meant for Mesa Verde, and they are meant for you. 
 So... all is righgt with the world. 
 Good night. 
 Night. 
 [Sighs] 
 Your brother is one smart lawyer. 
 The smartest one I know... I mean, no offense. 
 He'd make quite an adversary. 
 You'd better believe it. 
 The kind of adversary who'd find even the smallest crack in your defense. 
 Going against him, [Sighs] you'd really want to make sure you've got all your I's dotted and your t's crossed. 
 Nothing for him to find. 
 [Belt jingling] 
 [Brakes squeal] 
 [Engine rumbling] 
 [Gearshift clicks] 
 [Brakes squeal] 
 [Engine shuts off] 
 [Car door opens, closes] 
 [Car door opens, closes] 
 [Engine starts] 
 [Door beeps] 
 Hey, how you doing? 
 [Door closes] 
 Be with you in a minute. 
 [Copier beeping] 
 [Copiers whirring] 
 Remember me? 
 Uh... no. 
 [Scoffs] 
 I got a weird feeling you do, Lance. 
 Tonight is a funny night. 
 For some reason tonight, I feel like I've got all the answers. 
 I'm feeling kind of like, uh... like Carnac. 
 Do you remember when Johnny Carson used to do Carnac? 
 You know, he'd give the answers before the questions. 
 You know, [Sighs] Ed would give him the envelope, yeah? 
 And Johnny would hold it up to his forehead, and, um, he'd give the answer, like, "Leave It to Beaver." 
 Then Johnny'd tear open the envelope. 
 [Blows] 
 And there's the question... 
 "What did the dead raccoon say in his will?" 
 That ring a bell? 
 [Whirring continues] 
 Before your time? 
 All right, well, let's cut to the chase. 
 Um, that guy ‭who just walked out of here... his name is Ernie. 
 I'm guessing he showed you my picture and asked if ‭I was in here the other night. 
 Now he's going to bring his boss, who's my brother, and he's gonna ask you the same question... 
 "Did you see that guy the other night?" 
 Well, the answer is no. 
 You feel me? 
 You murder someone? 
 Nope. 
 Rob a bank? 
 No way am I that cool. 
 I... Sometimes, I go number two and I don't flush, but... this is just a thing between brothers. 
 And we're both lawyers, so... 
 Right? 
 I mean, ‭that's a long and boring story. 
 You don't wanna know. [Sighs] 
 Is this gonna get me jammed up with the cops? 
 My brotherer mht make it sound like that, but... no. 
 It's just family. 
 Then I feel you. 
 Hey, ‭tell me about the cameras. 
 Oh. Uh, they go to a VCR in the back. 
 It, uh, tapes for 12 hours and then records over itself. 
 Right. So I'm on there now? 
 How hard would it be to erase? 
 Mm. I dunno. 
 Could be tricky... and expensive. 
 Like 100 bucks expensive? 
 Like 200 bucks expensive. 
 You will go far, my young friend. 
 [Brakes squeal] 
 [Engine shuts off] 
 [Car door closes] 
 [Door beeps in distance] 
 Uh, good evening. 
 Uh, Lance, is it? 
 Yeah. 
 Lance, I'm Charles McGill. 
 Uh, my associate, uh, spoke with you earlier, and he showed you this photo. 
 Um, on or about ‭the morning of the 18th, this person was here in this shop... is that correct? 
 Uh. On or about the... 
 The 18th, early morning. 
 [Sighs] 
 No. 
 Well, I'm... ‭I believe you told my associate that he was here and that he made copies. 
 Yeah, but [Chuckles] sorry. 
 No. 
 [Insects chirping] 
 Yeah, that's my guy. 
 All right, the, uh, th-the night of Tuesday the 17th... leading into early Wednesday, early hours ‭of Wednesday the 18th... 
 [Copier beeps] 
 Were you, in fact, here? Can we establish that? 
 Uh, I mean, ‭I work graveyard, so, yeah. 
 Stay strong, Lance. 
 Was this man here, making copies? 
 [Sighs] 
 It's like I said... I don't think so. 
 Well, earlier, ‭you said that he was here. 
 Now you're saying that he wasn't here. 
 Which is it? ‭ 
 Oh. 
 [Chuckles] 
 Yeah, well, when that guy showed me the picture, I thought, "Maybe," but now that I'm seeing it again, uh... 
 Ah, sorry. 
 Don't know what to tell you. 
 Guess I was wrong. 
 [Copiers whirring] 
 [Electricity humming] 
 Son, ‭listen carefully. 
 I am an officer of the court, investigating a felony. 
 So you're a cop? 
 N-No, I'm not. ‭I'm... I'm... I'm, uh, I'm... 
 Mr. McGill, ‭maybe we better get you home. 
 [Distorted] Ernesto, do not speak to me as if I were a child. 
 I'm fine. 
 [Electricity humming] 
 [Insects chirping] 
 I am not a police officer. 
 I am an attorney. 
 And I have a moral and legal obligation to get to the bottom of this matter. 
 The bottom of what? 
 Forgery, fraud, falsifying evidence... 
 [Electricity humming] 
 Breaking and entering. 
 This guy... is he okay? 
 There's nothing wrong with me! 
 Mr. McGill, maybe we could just take a break and... 
 Ernie, shut up! 
 [Electricity humming] 
 You think about ‭the choice you're making. 
 I already told you he wasn't here. 
 What do you want me to say? 
 I want you to speak the truth. 
 I know he was here! 
 I know what he did! 
 Tell me what you told Ernesto. 
 Stop trying to change your story. 
 Excuse me. Sorry. How do we get this to do 11x14? 
 No, excuse me! 
 Are having a conversation here! 
 You got to switch it to tray four. 
 It's easier if I show you. Look. 
 ♪ ♪ 
 Dude, okay. 
 I-I... [Chuckling] I-I don't want any problems here. 
 So, just... [Sighs] get him out of here, or I'm gonna call the cops, okay? 
 Do not walk away from me! We are not finished here! 
 I am done talking to you, man! 
 [Electricity humming loudly] 
 [Jimmy breathing heavily] 
 Call 911. 
 Call 911. Come on.
