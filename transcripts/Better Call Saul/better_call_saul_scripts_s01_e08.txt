 [Wheels squeaking] 
 [Indistinct conversations] 
 [Telephones ringing] 
 Jimmy : Hey, Gene. 
 Thanks, Jimmy. 
 Trina. 
 Hey, Jimmy. 
 Jimmy : Got a package, Dan. 
 How's it going? 
 What's up? 
 [Indistinct conversations] 
 [Telephone ringing in distance] 
 [Knock on door] 
 [Keyboard clacking] 
 Hey. 
 Hey, yourself. 
 Jimmy, I'm really slammed. Just tell me what you need. 
 What is it? 
 [Sighs] I can't open it. 
 [Breathes deeply] 
 So, what does it say? 
 [Laughs] 
 [Chuckles] 
 I must call to your attention the newly passed Environmental Impact and Sustainability Assurance Act, a statute that, as you know, went into effect without any ex post facto provisions in place. 
 You got a second, Chuck? 
 Um, not really. I'm I'm kind of... 
 It'll just take two seconds. I promise. 
 All right. 
 [Click] 
 What's this? 
 [Scoffs] Is this a joke? 
 No. No joke. 
 You... you passed the bar? 
 Yeah. I did. [Sniffs] 
 I... I thought if Kim could do it, maybe I can, too, you know? 
 So I got my last few credits for undergrad from a community college. 
 I mean, they're not just for draft Dodgers and yoga classes, all right? 
 Then I found a law school that would accept me. 
 You know, wasn't Georgetown or anything, but... 
 [Sighs] The University of American Samoa. 
 Oh. Correspondence school. 
 Well, I wasn't gonna quit work, right? 
 Mm-hmm. 
 Day... nights, weekends, you know? 
 They call it "distance learning" nowadays. 
 But they're accredited. Go, land crabs. 
 So, you know, I did that. 
 And, um, the bar exam's a mother. 
 I mean, for me it was. 
 I failed it the first two times, but I guess it's like losing your virginity... third time's the charm. 
 How... this must have taken you years. 
 And you kept it a secret all this time. 
 Why? You didn't come to me for help? 
 Jesus, Chuck, you're the busiest guy I know. 
 I mean, you're doing important sh1t. 
 [Laughs] Wow! 
 I don't know what to say. 
 Well, are you proud of me? 
 Hmm? Oh... Yes! 
 Absolutely. 
 Thanks. 
 Chuck, that means a lot. 
 Oh, hey. 
 I was hoping, you know, if you think it's appropriate, um, once I get sworn in and everything... 
 Consider hiring me? 
 As what? 
 Oh. A... a lawyer. 
 [Chuckling] Obviously. Yeah. 
 Well, that's a question I'm gonna have to take up with Howard and the other partners. 
 Uh, you know, it's not my decision alone. 
 But how could they say no? 
 So much drive. 
 Jimmy, look what you've done here. 
 [Laughs] 
 Burt : Oh, yeah! Whoo! 
 Oh, man. I told those guys devil's food. 
 All right, all right! 
 Yeah. Well, I will sue the store for you. 
 Good. Just remember us when you're all big-time, huh? 
 I don't remember you now, Burt. 
 You're representing mail room, so you show those upstairs jackholes how it gets... 
 Hey. 
 What are you folks up to? Having a party? 
 [Chuckles] Just a little celebration on behalf of New Mexico's newest attorney. 
 I heard. Jesus, Jimmy, you're a regular Charlie Hustle. 
 Congratulations, my friend. 
 Oh, thank you. Thanks. 
 Uh, would you like some cake? 
 Oh, here. Uh, don't mind if I do. 
 [Chuckles] 
 Really, really impressive, Jimmy. 
 We're all proud of you. Hey, I hate to interrupt. 
 But could you guys give Jimmy and me a moment? 
 Sure. 
 Yeah, absolutely. 
 Please, sit down. 
 [Door closes] 
 [Photocopier whirring] 
 Uh, let's reassess in six months. 
 Thanks for understanding, Jimmy. 
 Uh, you want the door open or closed? 
 Closed. 
 [Whirring continues] 
 [Door closes] 
 [Telephone rings] 
 [Knock on door] How's it going? 
 Uh, settling back in. 
 Great. 
 So, apparently, they are ready for us. 
 Oh, thanks, but I want to get a couple things done before lunch, and I'm still trying to settle... 
 Come on, Kim. You deserve this. 
 Come bask in the glow. 
 Howard :  Thank you all for coming. 
 I appreciate you making time in the middle of your busy days. 
 I'm pleased to announce that working closely with the Bernalillo County district attorney's office, we have reached a plea agreement for former treasurer Craig Kettleman. 
 We believe this is a just and fair outcome and brings to a close an incident Mr. Kettleman deeply regrets. 
 He is committed to making amends for his mistakes...  Can I help you? Yeah, I'm here to see Mrs. Landry. Oh. Sign in right here, please. Are you a relative? Lawyer. [Clears throat] But I treat my clients like family. Oh. Uh, y... you know where to find her? Yeah. Thanks. Ah. [TV chatter] Hey. [Sighs] Good morning, folks. [Chuckling] Hi. Jimmy McGill. I... oh. Hey, pick a card, any card. All right. How's it going there? Good. Whoa! Not so t... Oh. Shh. Little surprise from the card fairy. [Chatter continues] Give me back squeeze. Squeeze whatever you got that's below the water that I can't see. Oh, yeah. All right, Mrs. Landry, just a few more signatures, and, uh [Clears throat] thy will be done. Would you like another hydrox? No, thank you. I'm all hydrox'd out. Well, please help yourself if you change your mind. All right. That one. Okay. And that one. And that is it. [Sighs] What a relief. I should have done this years ago. Well, people do tend to put it off. Hmm. But everybody should have a will. Please tell your friends. And that comes to $140. And I'm happy to take, uh, cash or a check or, uh... cash. [Chuckles] O... one moment. [Sighs] [Chuckles] Could you write me a check? Well, it's been so long, I... I... I really don't know if I have enough in my account. I am so sorry. Thi... this is awful, but... [Sighs] ... All I have is $43. Okay. Now, I could ask for an advance. I... I... I am so sorry. It's fine. I... I don't know what to say. This is awful. Uh, oh, you could keep the will until I get my allowance, and... and that should only be until the end of next week. Okay, that's not necessary. Here's my address. Just mail it to me when you've got it, all right? And why don't we, uh... we'll just make it an even $120. All right? Oh. Oh. Thank you. You have a nice day. [Indistinct conversations] [Knock on door] Excuse me. Allowance? Your family has you on an allowance? Oh, no, no. It's... it's my money. I just get it from Sandpiper Crossing. $500 a month... I don't understand. You should have social security checks... Mm-hmm. ... Plus that pension we talked about. So how are you on an allowance? Well, the checks go to Sandpiper, and then they take out my fees and... and my expenses. Why don't you just come on in? I'm afraid I'm not explaining it very well. I... I have statements here... somewhere. Somewhere. Okay. Here... So your pension and social security goes straight to the Sandpiper people? They take out... they take out what they need, and then... and then I get my allowance. Here. And... and all the rest goes into my savings account. It's really all very above-board. A lot of places do it this way. This is how they do it for everybody around here? Well, yes, they... they try to make everything easy for us. Mrs. Landry, are any of your friends around who I could talk to? [TV chatter] [Indistinct conversation in distance] I see you spent... now, I don't know if you noticed... $187.50 on 4-10-12. Do you know what 4-10-12 is? No. In order to find out, you have to look on the back. Okay? And see this key. I see you have reading glasses. Can I borrow your glasses? Yes. Thank you. Oh, these are gonna help me, but I don't know if they'll do the trick. [Chuckles] So tiny. 4-10-12... I think it might be Q-tips. I can't tell. It's probably an accident, but we should look into it. don't you think? They're not doing this intentionally. Okay? This could be a mistake. But if we correct the mistake, then you'll get some money back, and it'll be fair. [Door closes] Jimmy : Hey, Chuck. My boxes, the ones I left... Oh. Sandpiper Crossing... Sandpiper Crossing... [Sighs] Did you do my wills? Yes, I did. Hey. Would you look at that? Thank you. Don't thank me. This was a one-time thing, and don't think I don't see what you were doing here. You wanted to play Tom Sawyer, wanted me to paint the fence, and god help me, it worked. You need help? Hire a paralegal, stand on your own two feet. Yeah. Sure. I'll do that. You're not even listening to me. No, I... I hear you, Chuck, okay? Self-reliance. It's great stuff. Would you look at this? What did I just say? Ta... take a look, okay? Just right here. Do you see what I see? [Sighs] All I'm asking is for you to take a look. Please? "Sandpiper Crossing... " It's a retirement home, assisted living. It's... this is one of their monthly invoices they send their residents. What exactly am I looking for? It's nothing earth-shaking. Just little things, little things like... like this right here. $14 for code 118-62. What's 118-62? I wonder. How could you even read this? It's like microfilm. [Groans] 118-62 is facial tissue. 14 bucks for a box of Kleenex. Yeah, I found others. There's $3.50 for a single roll of toilet paper, 22 bucks for a bottle of aspirin. It's a clear pattern of overcharging. Nothing huge, but it adds up to real money. I mean, here, look. This woman... she got soaked for like 400 bucks last month. And there's a pretty solid attempt at concealment of that fact, which to my way of thinking, makes it... Fraud. This was in work I did? Yeah, you must have missed it. Um, look, Chuck, I got lucky, right? Even a stopped clock is right twice a day. And this is no mom-and-pop outfit, okay? I dug around a little. They're owned by some kind of real-estate investment trust. I'm working at getting more info, but this could be big. I mean, this could be a big case, right? [Sighs] Well... if it's more than a few errant billings and if it's systematic and you establish a pattern, it could be class-action. What do I do now? I mean, what next? Well, you're gonna need more information. You don't want to go off half-cocked. Full cock. Okay. [Chuckles] No, I... I'm gonna head back there. Thank you. You're the best. [Birds chirping] Back to see Mrs. Landry. [Shredder whirring in distance] Okay. What gives? Sorry, sir. New policy. We're concerned about solicitation on premises. I'm not a gigolo, if that's what you're implying. Legal  solicitation. We are obligated to protect our residents from being harassed, and we have the right to refuse entry. [Whirring continues] I have clients in there. Now, they have the legal right to meet with me. Well, you'll just have to arrange to meet them elsewhere. Oh, come on, guys. Seriously? What, are you making soylent green back there? It's... all right, okay. I... I'm backing away. Yeah? You know what? Uh... This... Hey, this has gotten me a little bit stirred up down there. Can I use your restroom? Please, it's... I've got I.B.S. Go ahead. [Whirring continues] [Sighs] "To Sandpiper Crossing... ... clients of James M. McGill... This is to inform you to stay... [Knock on door] Sir? Are you all right in there? "We believe that... breach of contract... " Come on, now, sir. I've been very patient. "... clear pattern of malfeasance... This is a negligent infliction of emotional distress." Sir, I really need you to finish up and come out now. "... contact by the end of the week or I will be forced to move forward." Sir, I need you to finish up... This is a demand letter informing Sandpiper Crossing of pending litigation for defrauding my clients through systematic overcharging. You're shredding in there! I'm not deaf! I can hear you! Stop right now! [Shredding continues] This here... this makes it official, right? If you don't stop shredding right now, that's destruction of evidence... spoliation! That's what it's called, and it's a felony! So call your lawyers right now and tell them I said that... me... James McGill esquire! I'm telling you guys, big mistake! Aah! [Buzzer] [Cellphone ringing] Hey. Stacey : Hey. Am I calling at a bad time? No, not at all. How you doing? Uh, pretty good. Getting by. How about you? Getting by. It's good to hear from you. Yeah. I... I've been... there's been a lot going on. You know how it is. Yeah, I know. Uh, listen. I was... was hoping maybe you could do me a favor. Do you think you could watch Kaylee? It'd be during my shift the day after tomorrow. Look, I hate to ask, but my regular sitter's down... anything you need, I'll be there. You can get off work? I don't want to impose or anything. [Brakes squealing] No. Anytime. It's not an imposition. Thanks. Appreciate it. Yeah, no problem. At a quarter to 2:00? I'll see you then. Okay. [Beep] [Insects chirping] [Breathing heavily] Ohh! Jesus! [Coughs] [Breathing heavily] Aah. [Groaning] [Breathing heavily] [Spits] Come on. Where is it? Oh. Oh! [Sighs] Oh! God damn it! Harold : And it didn't even make it fit. [Gasps] And I'm like, "it's not like we're close to being done." I mean, can't you get somebody else to do it?" Right. They don't pay any of us enough for this sh1t. Harold : You know what? And it's going on and on and on. And so I'm like, "why are you making  your  problems  my  problems?" Right. Like you don't have enough problems of your own. Exactly! That's exactly what I'm saying. Thank you. But he just... [Groans] 
 
 [Indistinct conversation in distance] [Cellphone ringing] [Whispering] James McGill. Schweikart : Mr. McGill, Rich Schweikart of Schweikart and Cokely. We're the law firm representing Sandpiper Crossing assisted living. How are you this evening? Quite well, thank you. How are you? Doing fine. Doing fine. I'm sorry to call so late. Did I catch you at a bad time? No, no. No, it's fine. It's just that you're whispering. I'm at the opera. Oh. What opera? "Magic Flute." Mozart! Lovely. Well, I'll try not to keep you. We received... something from you today, and we're not quite sure what. It's a demand letter. Ah. Well, it was a little confusing 'cause it was written on, uh... Well, I had to write it quickly because your clients were in the process of destroying evidence. Mr. McGill, if you're talking about shredding documents, that's neither irregular nor illegal. Every business in America does it. You say potato, I say spoliation. Mm-hmm. Maybe you should walk me through what you're alleging here. I believe it's all in the letter. Uh, uh, I... I'm not saying it's not, but it's a bit hard to read. Next time, I'd use double-ply. Let's not fixate on the medium, okay? Let's look at the message. Now, your clients are facing multiple counts of elder abuse and... and fraud and deceptive and unfair trade practices, and that's just the start, okay? I'm not a betting man, but I bet the farm I'll find more. Mr. McGill, are you related to Charles McGill? He's my brother. Yeah? How's he doing these days? I... I fail to see the relevance of this. Frankly, the only reason that I made this phone call was out of respect for Charles on the off chance that you might be related to him. My partner suggested that the best response would be to send a rule 11 letter and have you sanctioned, but I didn't want to jump to that immediate length. Hey, how about you stop trying to rattle my cage and just, you know, respond to the merits? This is my response, Mr. McGill... you have no good-faith basis to threaten  any  litigation. This is a shakedown, and we both know it. Now, if you push this any further, my hands will be tied. Sorry for interrupting your evening. Enjoy "The Magic Flute." [Beep] Blow my magic flute. [Rustling] [Grunting] [Thud] Aah! [Sighs] [Groaning] Son of a bitch! [Spits] [Coughs] [Breathing heavily] [Gas hissing] [Sighs] [Paper rustles] [Groans] [Sighs] [Sniffs] Jimmy, what are you doing here? Oh, uh, Chuck, um... Sorry to... show up like this. I just needed space to work. What is all this? What have you done to my dining room? They were spoliating, the Sandpiper people. They wouldn't let me in, and I could see that they were shredding. I wrote them a demand letter, and I gave it to them. You broke in to a nursing home? Assisted living. And you stole their garbage. My god. No, it was in public. There was no lock, no nothing. I just lifted the lid, and there it was. There's no reasonable expectation of privacy in that situation, is there? You can't say it's private if a hobo can use it as a wigwam. That's... that's the standard, right? If animals or vagrants can get in? More or less, yes. Okay, so this is all legal. I mean, it's completely above-the-belt legal. [Sighs] I just need to figure out what they're trying to cover up. You know, you don't shred like this unless you got something to hide, am I right? Not necessarily. Oh, come on, Chuck. A lawyer shows up, starts figuring out their little scheme, and suddenly this? No, it's not a coincidence. It's in here. Well, at least it's not crosscut. Look, you won't even know I'm here, okay? I just need some space and some quiet, and I'll be out of your hair as soon as I c... Stop, stop. It's okay. You can work here. [Sighs] Thanks. I don't mind the company. You look like you could use a cup of coffee. [Sighs] Good god, yes. I'll put it on. [Sighing] [Sniffs, clears throat] [Sighs] Up, up. Up. Shh, shh, shh, shh. [Sighs] God's sweet sake. [Sighs] [Sniffs] Yeah. [Gas hissing] [Exhales sharply] Oh, good. You're up. [Grunts] Well, Jesus, Chuck, how long have I been asleep? Chuck, how did you... ? I... I can't believe this. Uh... Uh, thank you. This is a huge help. I felt like I was shoveling snow in a blizzard. Well, it gets better. What's this? It's your smoking gun. It's a, uh... invoice for syringes. Yes. From? Morrissey Medical Supply Lincoln, Nebraska. So? Trust me. Meanwhile, we need to start pulling case law... any precedent dealing with 18 U.S.C. 1961 to '68. Probably not a bad idea to pull 30.47.1 from NMSA... Uh, 1978. I don't think that's gonna play, really, but it's a good opening salvo for us. Wait, "us"? We're working together on this? Mm. That's up to you, Jimmy. 'Cause... [Chuckles] [Laughs] Well... [Chuckles] All right. All right. All right. Let's get to work. [Insects chirping] [Telephone ringing] [Zipper closes] Kim Wexler. Jimmy : Hey, gorgeous. Oh, man. Sweet-talking right out of the gate? You want something. Make it fast. I want to go home. Okay, okay. Will you look something up for me on Westlaw? [Sighs] Please? You're lucky I'm a pushover. All right. Hit me. Thank you. Uh, anything on Sedima v. Imrex, Slesinger v. Disney, Holmes v. S.I.P.C... Whoa, whoa, whoa. Slow down, slow down. V. Disney. Holmes v. S.I... D.C., yeah. And, uh, anything on 57.12.1-24 NMSA, 1978. Uh, okay. It would help if I knew what you were looking for here. Anything, everything. What? You want me to just read you the head notes or something? No, no, print it... full cases, and any cases that cite to those cases. Shepardize like the wolf's at the door. Jesus, Jimmy, that's gonna be thousands of pages. Pretty please with sugar on top? [Scoffs] Come on. You owe me one. Yes, I do, but this is gonna take hours. And who do I bill it to? Bill it to Howard. I still remember his code... 1933, same year Hitler came to power. You're not funny. I'm not billing it to my boss. How about yours? I'll pay you back. Jimmy, this is 300, 400 bucks worth of printing. The accountants will find it and I'll get fired, which sounds fun and all, but no. Okay. Hold on a sec. [Gas hissing] Hey. Uh, Kim can't print without a code. Should I go over there, take notes, and come back? No, no, no. It would take too long. Use mine... 1868. Yeah. [Insects chirping] Jimmy : 1868. Use that. It's Chuck's. You're using Chuck's number? Does Chuck know you're using Chuck's number? We're working on something together. And bring it over to his place after. You're a lifesaver. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait! You're working a case together? Yeah. Keep this under your hat, but it's gonna be huge... maybe a class-action, even. We think it'll settle for $1 million, maybe $2 million. How does that work? Chuck's a partner at HHM. So what? Look, I know Chuck's partnership agreement chapter and verse. He can work with outside parties. That clause is intended for small-time stuff, pro bono cases. So? I'm bono. I'm very bono. Chuck's a rock star, okay? They'll work it out. And Chuck can handle this? Last time I saw him, he was... Last time you saw him, he wasn't himself, okay? This is good for him. Okay. What? I don't know. I'm just... Whatever. I'll see you in a couple hours. Okay. We're ordering a pizza, okay? I'll save you a slice. [Beep] [Birds chirping] [Sighs] Now, you know, if you don't separate those, you're gonna end up with brown. [Door opens] Stacey : Hello? [Door closes] Hey. We're in here. [Groans] We're playing sculptor. She's Michelangelina. How's work? Eh, you know... work. How did it go? Kid's a dream. She's easy. And you better stay that way. [Chuckles] How you doing, sweetie? Huh? [Smooching] Hmm? Well, I better be going. Oh, wait. Hang on a sec, would you? I want to talk to you about something. What's up? I want to know what I should do with this. I've been carrying it around for weeks, like holding on to it. Every place I put it feels wrong. I thought about putting it in the collection plate, but... It seemed... I don't know. Look, with Matty gone, I have expenses, and the death benefit helped, but... What I want to ask you is... [Sighs] ... Can I spend this? Stace, if this money helps you and Kaylee, if it does a single good thing in this world, then you spend every penny. [Sighs] That's a relief. It'll help a lot. [Sighs] Of course, it's only a drop in the bucket. I swear, everyone I know has had problems with them. I had one. The computer in the engine... it locked in the middle of the Rockies. Yeah, it decided I was overheating, and that was it. Yeah. I couldn't get it fixed for a hundred miles. I had to have it towed to Telluride. It was unbelievable. [Beep] Huh. No, it's... it's the chip. It's the little... Yeah, it's like 800 bucks, not counting... Labor. Hey, Mel, can I call you back? [Beep] [Birds chirping] Chuck, the Sandpiper has landed. Gentlemen, I'm Jimmy McGill. Welcome. Rich Schweikart. This is Alvin Reese. Phil Jergens. Thanks for coming. Oh, whoa. I have to ask you. Uh, please leave electronics in the car... laptops, blackberries, palm pilots, watches. If you lick it and it goes bzzt, leave it here. Why? My brother Chuck has a certain sensitivity. It's a medical condition. This is the price of admission. Yeah, I heard about this. Go ahead. It's fine. [Chuckling] Here you go. Make yourselves comfortable, gentlemen. I'll be right back. All right. Chuck. Come on, buddy. I... I don't... I don't know if I can do this. You... oh, you can do this, all right? These guys... Those guys... they're nothing. Okay? They're the Pistons, and you're the Bulls. All right? All you got to do is sit there and look intimidating. They're scared of you already, and they should be. You're Charles McGill. Let's go. Let's go get 'em. Ah. [Chuckling] Hey. Do you remember me, Charles? We were on a co-defense... Church's Donuts v. Amendola? Oh. It was... Jesus 9, 10 years ago. [Chuckles] Yeah. Oh, our guys were suing the other guys, and they were suing us right back, and the city had some grievance with everyone, so we had to bundle like four actions together, and I was sure that we were sunk. But  you...   you quoted... what was it? Huh? Addyston Pipe & Steel. You turned it all antitrust, and the whole thing went away in summary judgment. It was amazing. It was amazing. I figured you'd be arguing in front of the Supreme Court someday. Well, it's, uh, good to see you. Yeah. [Clears throat] All right, well, let's get started. Um, we've read your revised demand. It's, uh, quite a laundry list. Very creative. Jimmy : Yeah, creative, like the way your clients have been billing my clients. 'Cause that's like Salvador Dalí creative. That's cute. Y... you know, you're not gonna make this stick. Setting aside evidentiary concerns... whoa, whoa. Your guys couldn't afford 10 bucks for a padlock? That's on them. Public property. Maybe a judge sees that your way, maybe he doesn't. But the damages for elder abuse? The statute requires proof that there was some undo influence... someone threatening the residents of Sandpiper Crossing. As far as I understand it, no one has claimed there's a guy with a knife telling them to hand over their lunch money. There are a lot of assisted-living facilities out there that may be disreputable, but that's not the case with our client, not even close. All their facilities all 12 of them... every single one, five-star rated. You go to any one of them right now, and you know what you'll see? You'll see happy, healthy residents. Sandpiper takes care of these people. They don't bilk them. But we looked into it, and some of your clients have, in fact, been overbilled. It's... it's an accounting error. It doesn't rise to the level of fraud, not even close. We've calculated the damages. All told, it's $46,320. Mm-hmm, so here's what we're prepared to do. We're gonna make your clients whole... a check for the $46,000 and change right now. And on top of that, we'll give you another $46k to cover your expenses. So what's that? $92,000? Let's call it $100,000 even. We admit to no wrongdoing, and your clients release all claims. [Sighs] I think you're gonna need to do better than that. Ah, this was in your demand letter. They're syringes. So? I... I don't know if you know this, but that's a pretty standard item in an assisted-living facility. Correct. But it's not  what  it is that matters. It's where it's from. Lincoln, Nebraska. Go, cornhuskers. Well, since you're not picking up what I'm putting down, I'll explain it to you. Um, Nebraska, although they both begin with the letter "N," actually turns out to be a different state than New Mexico. So your client accepted shipments across state lines for its enterprise. I... in the U.S. mail, no less. Are you trying to make this a RICO case? Like our client is John Gotti or something? Well, you know as well as I do RICO's used mostly for business beefs. Sedima establishes a pretty low threshold for RICO provisions to kick in. Interstate commerce is a bitch, huh? As soon as we establish a pattern to... what was your word? Uh, "overbillings"? I prefer the classic term of "fraud." You're looking at treble damages. So your 100 grand... I think you know where you can stick it. Will you give us a moment? [Indistinct whispering] Well... What number exactly did you have in mind? $20 million. Excuse me? You heard me. Oh, you can't expect... $20 million. Or we'll see you in court. [Clock ticking] [Chuckles] Hmm. Jimmy : $20 million? Chuck : Didn't you hear them? This is a big company. 12 separate facilities. They can't possibly all be in New Mexico. This is potentially a multi-state federal class-action lawsuit with a RICO kicker at the penalty phase. $20 million? That's conservative. Now, class cert... that's where we start. I'll draft our complaint, try to get us a conditional one. They'll try to pierce it, but it should hold long enough to start discovery. And we need to get you back on the grounds, quash this prohibition against you. Uh, some injunctive relief. Maybe a T.R.O. [Dog barking in distance] Jimmy? Do you want to get started on the T.R.O.? Yeah. Yes. [Dogs barking] [Barks, growls] It looks good. No heartworm, no mange. Where did you get her? Shelter. Good. There's too many puppy mills out there. I had a dachsie in the other day. Some douche bred her so much, poor thing, she just had one giant hernia for a belly. Couldn't even walk. Those people can go straight to hell, as far as I'm concerned. Anything else I can do for you? You still in touch with your people? Depends on the type of work you're looking for... your dos, your don'ts, your wills, your won'ts. Well, if you tell me what you've got, I'll tell you what I'll do. I signed up three more clients at the mall today. Jesus, those mall walkers... Those geezers are faster than you think. I could sleep for a decade. Did you get what I asked? The, uh, code provisions? Ohh. sh1t. [Sighs] Uh, it's in the car. [Sighs] Just give me a minute. I'll, uh... I'll go. Where's the... [Inhales deeply] Chuck? Hey. [Sighs] Chuck? Yeah. [Birds chirping]
