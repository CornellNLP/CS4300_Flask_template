 I knew you were in Black Ops, but... 
 But you can't talk about it. 
 Look, all that's important is that you're safe, you're here now. 
 But I am gonna have to ask you to tell me what happened again, okay? 
 The man who killed David... you've never seen him before? 
 There was a fundraiser for David's charity at the Vice President's residence. 
 David was running late. 
 [indistinct conversations] 
 Ladies and gentlemen... 
 I'd like to say a few words while we're waiting for our illustrious guest of honor to arrive. 
 When David asked me to host this charity event here, I couldn't say no. 
 [laughter] 
 For years, David has represented people on both sides of the aisle. 
 And he has guarded our most tightly held secrets. 
 [door opens] 
 David? 
 What are you doing? 
 The President and Vice President are waiting for you. 
 See that light... 
 David : the blue one? 
 Watergate. 
 Five burglars did in seven minutes to Nixon... 
 What Russia, China, and Cuba couldn't do in seven years. 
 I knew about it... ahead of time.

 Nixon wasn't happy with a landslide victory.

 I-I was a junior senator. It was my first day on the hill. 
 I ran into Ted Kennedy. 
 I wanted his advice. 
 And Ted says, "Well, Senator, I want you to call David Williams, and I want you to tell him all your secrets, and then pay him to keep them safe." 
 David, what's going on? 
 I've sheltered you the best that I can. 
 No one can be trusted, not the CIA, not the FBI... nobody. 
 What are you talking about? 
 I got in too deep. 
 I thought I could know evil without becoming it. 
 You're my hope. If I die, you take the reins. 
 Die? What? 
 At the place we're going, there's something there. 
 You keep it safe, hopefully, it will do the same for you. 
 Keep me safe? David, you're scaring me. 
 President Eckhart is being set up for a fall. 
 They're creating a shadow government. 
 Who is? 
 Boom! Ha ha! 
 It's gonna be my lucky night. 
 Where the hell you been? 
 Working. 
 Did you bring the gift for our guest of honor? 
 I did. 
 Excellent. 
 They thought they could buy me off. 
 They don't teach you in law school lawyers don't make criminals better... the criminals make us worse. 
 Oh, damn, I forgot something. I got to go back upstairs.

 Sums up David's clientele. 
 He had that watch for years. 
 Never went anywhere without it. 
 Didn't even keep time. 
 Well, he gave it to you for some reason. 
 [keyboard clacking] 
 Do you think that watch is the key to stopping whoever is trying to take out the President?

 Hey, you know what? If you need to get cleaned up or anything, there's a bathroom down the hall there. 
 Keep coming, keep coming, keep coming.

 But Williams was with a woman. 
 She's got the watch now. 
 Tall blonde? 
 Yeah, sounds about right. 
 Kind of hot. 
 Oh, sh1t. 
 This is for the speaker of the house. 
 Six!

 Seven's the number. 
 Woman : Oh! 
 Okay, sweetie, what do you want to do? 
 Uh, hey, give me a minute. 
 I'll be right back, babe. 
 Okay. 
 [indistinct talking] 
 F.Y.I., that's called having fun. 
 Williams is dead. 
 And there was a witness... 
 Pamela. 
 It gets worse. 
 Williams gave her the watch. 
 Does Gray know? 
 Compartmentalization. It's how we work, right?

 There you are. 
 John : I ever tell you about that time I wrecked my uncle's Camaro, and he kicked my ass for it? 
 Your uncle and I would have gotten along just fine. 
 My point is, I would much rather go through that again than do this. 
 The rules of this program are rather simple... no loose ends. 
 I followed the rules. 
 No, you didn't! 
 And the proof of that is in the other room. 
 It was a clean break, just like you said. 
 But you left a number just in case? 
 You didn't? 
 What I did was make a choice. 
 Duty above all else. 
 [computer chiming] 
 You got it? 
 Yeah. 
 That's gonna be Williams' phone records. 
 [computer beeping] 
 Well, last call was to Pamela, 1930 hours. 
 He made one five minutes before that, but the number went to a burner. 
 [computer beeping] 
 Williams called somebody at the Vice President's residence? 
 I'm gonna go debrief the Vice President. 
 What are you gonna do with Williams? 
 Awful car wreck... like this whole operation.

 What's wrong? 
 We got to get out of here now. 
 You said we were safe here. 
 You make a call?

 Thank you very much. 
 Now, if you'll excuse me. 
 Vice President, we have a situation. 
 Man : Good evening, Madam Vice President. 
 [cellphone chimes] 
 You do know that I run the world's largest intelligence agency. 
 You don't think that I would find out about a screw-up of this magnitude? 
 There were complications, sir. 
 Oh, complications. 
 Thank you for the debriefing there, Chief. 
 We have a team searching for her now. 
 The group we use freelance out of the D.o.D. 
 Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. "Her"? 
 Pamela Richardson. 
 Pamela Richardson? 
 What, Bob Woodward wasn't available? 
 With all due respect, sir, I've handled much bigger problems than this. 
 You know, you... you interrupt me one more time... and the next person who finds you will be operating a backhoe. 
 He's right. 
 Handle her and find the watch. 
 This whole operation goes belly-up. 
 Come on. Got to pull it together. 
 Oh, that's easy for you to say, Mr. Speaker. 
 You're Teflon in this.

 Now, they find out what I been doing, huh, I'll make Snowden look like a good guy. 
 They'll want to run him for the G.O.P. nomination. 
 Relax. It's not gonna happen. 
 That we agree upon. 
 I'll never live to testify. 
 These are some of the most powerful people in the world. 
 We didn't get here without having a few skeletons in our closet. 
 I take it Mr. Williams knew where they were all hidden. 
 David not only knew everybody's secrets, he kept a record of them. 
 Which means that everyone here has a motive to kill him. 
 So why pass on those secrets to Pamela? 
 Why put her in that sort of danger? 
 Maybe he had a reason. 
 Maybe he thought he could trust her. 
 If a fifth column is being formed, we'll need proof. 
 Well, we've got the last number Williams dialed.

 Did he mention anybody else? 
 No, but may I remind you, if Gray's involved, I doubt he's acting alone. 
 And the only individuals powerful enough to execute anything on this level will not go gently into the night.

 Where do you come from? 
 New York. 
 Oh, just like Richard.

 This watch belonged to an officer in the Great Patriotic War. 
 How do you come to find such a fine piece? 
 A friend gave it to me. 
 Well, I must look inside... see if all the jewels are there.

 It's... you know how much money this watch is worth. 
 It's not about the money.

 Give me what I came for, come on.

 You know, they say that Judas betrayed Jesus for, uh... 
 30 coins of silver. 
 A modest amount for his time. 
 They also say that most people believe that he was motivated by avarice. 
 And you don't? 
 No. 
 A disciple of Judas' stature, to say that he did it simply because of... of greed, nah. 
 That... that is an insult. 
 I believe that he did it to protect the people he loved. 
 The better good, if you will. 
 Ah. 
 I'll be outside if you want to talk more. 
 Gray's gonna make a deal. 
 If we lose him, we could lose everything. 
 Maybe that's a good thing. 
 You want control of the playground... punch out the scariest guy you can find. 
 During Cold War, KGB planted suitcase bombs in secret vaults across United States as part of doomsday scenario. 
 Each watch opened a different vault. 
 Yeah. 
 After Gorbachev and Reagan, the bombs were taken away, but the vaults with their self-destruct mechanism remained. 
 So where's the vault in D.C.? 
 The one in D.C.? 
 Richard, there are dozens in D.C.

 But isn't that the first place they'll look? 
 I hope so.
