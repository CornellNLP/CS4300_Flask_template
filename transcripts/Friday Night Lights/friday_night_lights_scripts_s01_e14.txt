 Lois : Can I just say that you're choosing to date a football player? 
 He doesn't buy into the whole jock thing. 
 People change. 
 Especially when they're on the team. 
 Look, it's just some pick-me-ups I've been taking. 
 What are you doing to my son? 
 Mama! 
 I wanna know what's going on here. 
 This. 
 Smash is not gonna be playing the game Friday night. 
 (ALL CLAMORING) 
 Taylor : Quiet! 
 Am I off the team? 
 I should report this. 
 You're gonna get yourself clean. 
 Our dad is down in Corpus Christi. He's working on a driving range. 
 Couple postcards every year and he gets off scot-free! 
 I'm the one paying the bills around here, going out there and watching your damn football games! 
 What's this? 
 Man : You've been served. 
 Served by who? 
 Jason Street's family. 
 It's killing me to have to do this to Coach. 
 The lawyers, my parents, maybe they're right. 
 Maybe someone teaches me how to tackle somebody, and I'm not in a chair. 
 Why'd you set Lyla up on a date with Ty Johnston? 
 I don't want Lyla to be a caregiver her whole life, son. 
 It's the Buddy Garritys of this world, they're a cancer to you and me. 
 Lyla Garrity, will you marry me? 
 Jason : So, there's two cones... 
 Buddy : Yeah. 
 ...on either side of the goal. 
 There's two goals, one on either side of the court. 
 Okay. 
 We play on a basketball court. And, uh, the goal is to get this ball... 
 Y'all watch those windows. 
 And you wheel yourself through the finish... That's okay. 
 Sorry. 
 You wheel yourself through the goal line and that's how you score. 
 Pam : Oh. 
 Yeah. 
 The position I really want is called the picker. 
 That's like the quarterback, right? 
 Right. 
 Right. He kind of controls the flow of the game and he leads the breaks and everything. 
 You gotta be really fast. 
 It's a really, really hard position, but I think I'm good enough for it. 
 So is this what I see them playing at the YMCA sometimes? 
 Oh, no, ma'am. 
 That's wheelchair basketball. 
 (BUDDY LAUGHS) 
 Well, there is a big difference, Mr. Garrity. 
 I mean, the guys who play quad rugby, they're world-class athletes. 
 Three of them won medals last year at the world championships. 
 Did they? 
 Yeah. 
 Oh, I know. 
 I know. It's great. 
 It's a great hobby. 
 Pam : Come on, can we... 
 Dad, it's not a hobby. 
 You can't make a living from it, honey, so it must be a hobby. 
 Pam : You guys, let's come on and eat. All right? 
 You know what, Mr. Garrity? 
 What exactly do you have against quad rugby again? 
 Nothing. 
 Yes, you do. 
 'Cause every time I come over here, you're always making fun of it. 
 Sweetie... 
 All I'm saying is it's not a way to make a living. 
 So what are you gonna live off of, huh? Lawsuit? 
 Pam : Buddy! Enough, okay? 
 Oh, is that what this is about, Mr. Garrity? 
 Yeah. It is. 
 You're still pissed off about the lawsuit? 
 Yes, I am. 
 What are you, a little kid? 
 Get over it! 
 No. 
 Hey, let me tell you something, son. 
 Yeah? 
 You're suing my team. 
 You're suing my coach. 
 How do you expect me to feel, Jason? 
 It's your team? 
 How about a little compassion, Mr. Garrity? 
 I mean, I am paralyzed now! 
 All right. Play the game. 
 I don't care. Play the game. 
 Jason : Play the game. 
 I will play the game, Mr. Garrity. I will. 
 Yeah. Good. Good. 
 And when I make the national team and I start touring all over the world, I'll take your daughter with me. How about that? 
 'Cause we're getting married. 
 Excuse me? 
 Jason : That's right. 
 Pam : Married? 
 Yeah, we picked out a ring this morning. Didn't we? 
 (SCOFFS) 
 Daddy... 
 What are you doing? 
 What am I doing? 
 He's pushing me. 
 Jason. 
 I'm not doing anything wrong here, Lyla. 
 Lyla! 
 Ralph on radio : Good evening, football fans. 
 I'm Ralph Jarrett, broadcasting live from Applebee's in Reiner Junction for a special playoff edition Talking Panther football. (CHEERING) You know, the brackets have been set, and we know Dillon has drawn the McNulty Mavericks in the first round. Buddy : I'm going all the way with them, baby. Ralph : Oh, big question. Well, here's my money. Smash Williams, he got benched last week. He didn't play. Is he gonna be able to play this Friday night? Let's get to the phone lines. So, who had the quesadilla burger? Anyways, he got exactly what he deserved. Pierce : Shut up, man. I mean do you even know what happened? Bradley : Big shot now? Gonna take us to State by yourself? Point is we won last week without him. You started it. Hey, how did your meeting with Mr. Connolly go? It actually went really good. Yeah? Well, I mean, what I really want is I want my own column. You know, where I could do reviews on movies and books and concerts. That'd be cool. "Julie Taylor's Column On Life." Julie Taylor's Column? That's what you're gonna call it? "Julie Taylor's Column On Life?" Plus, on top of that... Matt Saracen is in the house. Maybe he'll come up and join us. Come on, Matt! Come on, Matt! (PEOPLE CHEERING) People : (CHANTING) Saracen! Saracen... I really don't have to do this. I could stay right here. No. Go, go. Okay, I'll be, like, two seconds. (PEOPLE CHANTING) Ralph : Matt, sit down here and talk a little football. There you go. Thank you. Look, I'm so sorry. I didn't think... I mean, that guy can talk. Seriously. He doesn't stop talking. No, it's cool. You're the big star now, right? No, I'm not a big star. I didn't know that... I'm sorry. I thought it was just gonna be like, "Hi," and then I came back and you... Matt, they wouldn't even let me pay for dinner. (ROCK MUSIC PLAYING ON STEREO) Tim : Tonight's your night, my friend! Saracen! You're coming with! Matt : No, I'm not. Tim : Let's go. I'm with Julie right now. Yeah, that's the point. Wait, no, Julie's... Let's go! Saracen, get in. Julie : Wait, where are you taking him? Tim : Hey, duty calls. Keep him in there. Tim : I'm sorry, but it's a football thing. You're not just gonna leave me here. Sorry. It's a football thing. Yeah, but I need a ride home. Tim : Let's go! Matt : Let me go! Matt : They're making me do this. I don't wanna do this. Yeah! Let's go! Sorry. Boy : Let's go! (TIM WHOOPING) Football. You know, he's not coming back if that's what you're thinking. Want a ride? Uh, no, thank you. Um, I'll just call my mom. Wait! (STAMMERING) Are you sure you don't mind? Yeah. No problem. Just gotta pick my sister up first. Okay. Where's she at? Working. Strip club. Oh. Two ways to fold a towel, my way and the wrong way. Let's do it right. Yes, sir. Here's your game plan for Friday. I want 10 of them. Binders and notebooks over by the copier. Right now? Well, gee, yes, Smash. If it wouldn't be too much of an inconvenience. I'd appreciate it. Hey, let me tell you something. You think I'd rather be here right now with you at the crack of dawn than be home with my family cooking breakfast? Coach, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Huh? You thinking about that? Did you bring those test results from the clinic? Yes, sir. Let me see them. Coach, I didn't mean to... You didn't mean what? You didn't mean to risk my reputation and my career? Is that what you were gonna say? I got the chairman of the district executive committee, you know what he's doing? He's calling me. At home. So you're not the only one with your ass on the line, Smash. Yes, sir. That's good. Congratulations. Um, sir? I still don't see what the big deal is. Why can't I just pay the ticket and go? Well, the problem's not so much the speeding ticket. It's your failure to appear. Yes, sir. You see, I had an away game that day so I completely forgot to... Look, how about this? You pay the fine, you promise me you're not gonna speed out there, and I'll drop the charges. If it's okay with your folks. Is it okay if my, uh... My brother signs for me? Is he your legal guardian? Billy? What? Are you his legal guardian? Uh, no. Technically I'm not, but... Look, you're a minor. It has to be a parent or a legal guardian. Otherwise I have to take your license. This is no joke, son. Just get that signed. All right, Your Honor. Um, I'll just get my father to sign it. Just get it signed and bring it back. So last night was the first time I've ever set foot in a strip club. You don't say. (LAUGHS) I know we were there for, like, five minutes, but does your sister ever get, like, freaked out? I mean some of those guys were completely creepy. Yeah, well, she's a big girl. Plus, those guys are pretty harmless. Sad and pathetic, but harmless. Guess who her biggest customer is. Who? Buddy Garrity. Gross! It is! Okay. That color looks good on you. You should get it. I don't know. I don't really have the money for it. Uh... What are you doing? Tim, just let me sign the stupid paper, man. No, Billy. I can't risk it. It's my license. What is this? Some sort of "work out my stuff with Dad" thing? What are you talking about? Tim, how... We haven't even seen the guy in two years, man. We don't even know if he still lives here. I'm sure it'll be fine, Billy. All right. I'm good. Hey. Come here. Do not believe a word that that man says, okay? Because he is a total liar. And do not get drunk with him, because he is a mean son of a bitch when he's loaded. Billy. It's a signature. That's all I'm getting. All right. All right. All right. You got money? Yeah, I got money, Billy. I'm fine. Here, take that. Whatever you do, do not under any circumstances give that money to him. I understand, Billy. All right. All right. Okay. Hey. Tim : See you soon. Yeah. Tami : No, you are not going to a concert on a weeknight. But it's not just any concert. I mean, it's the Old 97's, and they're awesome. Well, if they're so awesome, why don't they get a gig on a weekend? What do I have to do to make this work? I will get on the floor and start groveling. Honey, what about your homework? I'll get it done. Before I leave. And you can check it, and I'll stay in on Saturday. And you and me and Dad, we can have, like, a family night... Oh, honey. Don't grovel. It's not becoming. Please? All right. You have to be in by 11:00. Not one second later. Yes, ma'am. And don't tell your father. Let me break it to your father. All you. Hey, where's your coat? Put your coat on! Um... Go hurry up! And make sure the door locks when you close it. Hurry up. Throwed his sorry ass out six months ago, sugar. Well, do you know where I could find him, then? Well, he used to hustle golf down in Jackson Crest. It's a little piece of crap muni somewhere out in the boonies. All right. I'll try him there. Thank you. Do that. Hey, if you see him, I want you to do something for me. I want you to tell him that I want my Conway Twitty back! They don't have him at Target no more. All right. Walt : All right, knock her close, buddy. Knock her close. Nice shot. That'll save you a couple bucks. Oh, well. It's just money, right? That's 60. Thanks, gentlemen. Enjoy the money. Oh, I will. Hit that driving range. Good God in heaven... Timmy? Come on! Give your old man a hug! Come here, boy. (SIGHS) Guess I'm in no position to be offering up any fatherly advice... (CLEARS THROAT) Given the circumstances. Just want me to sign right here? Yeah. Thanks. All right. Thanks. So, how you doing? I'm fine. Yeah? Yeah. How about you? I'm good. Real good. Yeah, I'm on the wagon now. You know, I've been sober, uh, six weeks next Tuesday. Nice. Otherwise I'd be buyin' you a beer. Well, that's all right. I gotta drive anyway, so... Oh, well... Yeah. Anyways, I should go... Can you hang out for a while? Oh. Yeah. Yeah, I can... I can stay for a bit. Well, I got $200 burning a hole in my pocket from Manny, Moe and Jack out there. You hungry at all? I could eat. Good. Okay, okay, I'm sorry. I didn't want it to happen like that. I really did not. It's okay. I swear. I know. It's kind of my fault, too. I don't know why I felt like I had to hide it from them. I know you're gonna think this is a total girl thing and I'm crazy, but... I've just... I've always had this vision, you know, of my wedding... And I'd be 25. There'd be this huge reception and dancing and toasts, and I just, I... And you don't know if you can do all that with me now. No, Jason. If you're gonna be honest, just... No. That has nothing to do with it being you. It's just... I haven't even applied to a college yet. And you haven't even said whether or not you're... You think I'm not going to college now? I don't know. I mean, I assume you are, but all you talk about is Herc and... Lyla, I lost my legs. Not my brain. Okay? I'm gonna go to school, I'm gonna get a job, and we'll have friends and we'll have a big house and a picket fence and a couple of puppies and that whole thing you dream about. No. Jason... Getting married's not going to change that. I have a life, too. I know. No, sometimes I don't think you care about that anymore. Or you think it's lame, and it scares me, Jason. No, that's not it at all. I just think that we're too young right now and we're rushing into this and I don't want to make a mistake. Message received, Lyla. Loud and clear. Can you please get my chair for me? Yeah. McGill : Blue! Twenty! Hut! You gotta get a block, Smash! Get out on the side! Come on, Smash! Pick it up! (WHISTLE BLOWS) What the hell you walking for? God dang! Go, Smash! Let's go. Baxter : Ain't so much fun when you're blocking, is it? Huh? Smash : Just doing my job, man. "Doing my job." Yeah. Just doing my job. McGill : Smash, you gotta get your head out front. You gotta drive his ass. Well, I can see you teaching him a lesson, Coach, but... Let's go. It's not gonna do us much good Friday night if he's hurt. Who said he was gonna play Friday night? Let's go! Come on, Eric. You gotta be kidding me. Baxter can't hold Smash's jock. Let's go! Hey, you're the coach. Run the ball! It's your team. God, I'm tired of this! But you know, tomorrow night'll be good. That's gonna be a lot of fun. Know what, Buddy? I'm trying to win a playoff game here. I don't have time to talk about a damn TV show. It's tradition. It's simple. All you gotta do is go up there and smile pretty, talk about football for half an hour. It'll be easy. You'll love it. It's all about football. Let's go! Hustle up now! How's he gonna get outside if we don't get that block inside? Besides, remember, you get a nice little appearance fee for doing it. Wait a second. Hold up! Hold up! Matt : Look, I'm really sorry. I know you wanted to go to the concert. Yeah, that was kind of the point, seeing you invited me. Right... But, you know, no biggie. I just pretty much sold my soul to my mother for permission. It just, you know, your dad asked me... Well, I've never... I've never been on TV before. Okay, so if my dad wasn't involved... Are you excited? Yeah, a little bit. Then you should go. But... Really? You have to remember this moment when I officially became the coolest and most understanding girl in the world. Okay, I will. I'll keep that in mind. Are you mad? A little, but I'll get over it. Good. Because... I also need you to watch my grandma while I do it. Please? Sure. Why not? See? You are the coolest, most understanding girlfriend in the world. "Girlfriend"? Or girl. Yeah, baby! That's what I'm talking about! Fish in a barrel! Nice shot. Not too shabby. Hey, here she is. Anna Banana! Come over here. Oh, hey, Walt. This is my boy Tim. Take care of him. Whatever he wants. All right? I'll be back in a minute. Okay. Thank you. Thank you. Oh, my God. So you're the son, huh? Nice to meet you. You know, he talks about you all the time. Really? Oh, yeah. Every Saturday when he comes in here for league, we get the whole update. Who you played, the score, how many touchdowns you made. Oh! He is so proud. And congratulations for making it to the playoffs, by the way. Check it out. Check it out. Huh? My God. Oh, baby! Huh? The new ball, he has only waited on that for a month! This is a weapon. You're in serious trouble, my friend. Don't go hurting yourself with that. Walt : No, I won't. Thank you. Give you a call. Okay, honey. Bye, sweetie. I'll see you later. I appreciate it. Hey, uh, if we're still gonna grab that bite to eat later, maybe it's best I stay at your place tonight. What do you think? Yeah, man. Bring it on. I got a couch with your name written all over it. All right. Walt : Hey! All right. This should be the screen pass to Riggins. When we finally score here. That's the play after this. Hang on a second. No, Coach, you gotta... If you hit forward... Hang on a second. I know what I'm doing. I smell Emmy. Hell, I'm gonna have to renegotiate that appearance fee. If you just hit it once... Stop. Hey, there's something wrong with the clicker. There's something wrong with the clicker. Producer : We'll... We'll work on that. Ow! Okay, let's not do a game film right now. Obviously we have a problem with the clicker. Let's do the interview. Uh, Coach, just relax and have a conversation. What would you like us to have a conversation about? About football. Oh, that's great. Okay. Let's do that. Anything specific? Matt, why don't you ask him, uh, some questions? Good? Yeah. Buddy : That's a good idea. Okay, uh, when you're ready. Well, okay, um... Well, I think what everyone wants to know is, um, is Smash gonna play on Friday? What the hell kind of question is that? You're supposed to be helping me out here, Saracen. Well, I just thought... Don't be goofy. Just ask a normal question, and let's get this over with. Matt : That's what everybody's been asking. Producer : Ask him about the tight end. You find everything in there, honey? Uh, yeah. Everything's good. Uh, here's your sandwich. Mmm, thank you. 
 
 (KNOCK ON DOOR) Good. Uh, I got it. Is it okay? I invited a friend over. I guess so. I like company all right. Mrs. Saracen : All right. That's the end of it, huh? That's all of the other. Footballed out of me. All of the other we got. It's ridiculous. I mean, that's one of the reasons I swore I'd never date a football player. Oh, honey. Matt's not really a football player. No offense, Lorraine. Oh, that's all right. (LAUGHING) All right, but now that he's acting like one... Yeah... Here's what you gotta do. Number one rule in dating a Dillon Panther... Always let him know you have options. Mmm... But I do have options. I'm gonna join the school paper. Mrs. Saracen : Mmm... I mean, like, the basketball team. They hate that. But I don't know anybody on the basketball team. Isn't that just kind of stupid? Okay, but see, he doesn't have to know that. I'm telling you, he's gonna have these rally girls fawning all over him until spring, okay? You gotta elevate your game. Buddy : Look, Eric, I have always loved Jason like my son. I still do. But this is my daughter we're talking about. And the bottom line is Jason's a quadriplegic now. I know it's not PC to say that, but I have to think about my daughter. She's my responsibility. I gotta think about her life. Let me tell you something. Jason Street's a good kid. He's gonna succeed no matter what he does. Just give them some time. Last thing you want to do is pressure them. You know that's gonna come around and bite you in the ass, you do that. Yeah. Yeah. They're smart kids. They'll deal with it. I thought they were smart. I thought they were till they tell me they're getting married. They're just in high school. I mean, maybe someday in the future if things work out. So, please, just talk to Jason. He respects you. All right, I'll do that. Thanks. I'll do that. Thank you. If someone would talked to his parents, maybe I wouldn't be getting sued right now. Yeah, I wish I could talk to them for you. Hey! That was a great job in there. Thanks. Yeah. Corrina : Child, where you been? It's almost time for  Leno! Brian? You been running this whole time? Mostly. I stopped once or twice. Oh, I think you need to slow down. Don't even worry about it. Oh, I do worry about it. That's my job. That's your job? Well, I'm doing my job, too, Mama. All right? I'm so tired I can barely finish my sets without feeling like I'm gonna fall over and die. I know. It's that poison. Your body just needs time to adjust. Mama, I don't have any time! You know what it's like over there? It's like blood in the water! I mean, I got Baxter trying to steal my job and Coach watching me like a hawk! So, no, no! I'm not gonna slow down! At least not right now. I just worry about you. I know... (FOOTSTEPS RUNNING UP STAIRS) (DOOR CLOSING) Walt : All Jason wanted to do was slalom. I bet I was in that boat with him for three hours trying to get him up. Going around and around. You remember? Yeah. I remember. Was pretty pissed that day. I don't think J's gonna be doing too much more skiing anymore, though. It's a damn shame. He's good people, that kid. Yeah. How's Billy doing? Good. He actually says to say hi. Did he really? No. Not at all, really. Well, Billy's all right. I know he hates me. I don't blame him. You were too young, but he saw some things that I'm not too proud of. Dad, I was ten. I wasn't blind. Hey, did you call your coach? Yeah, I did. He's pretty rattled for missing two practices. Yeah, I reckon. It's worth it, though. So what do you think of Parcells? Stick around for another year or what? Maybe get a ring? Freakin' Cowboys. No, no. Freakin' Cowboys. I'm gonna start rooting for the Saints. No kidding. Next on number one tee will be the Riggins twosome. Riggins. $5 dance-off. Automatic presses when you're down two. All right. Well, that's not fair 'cause I got... Which is why I'm giving you six strokes. Now, don't be a whiner. Well, let's up the ante, then. I win, you come to Dillon on Friday to watch me play. Deal? Uh-huh, and what if I win? If you win, which you won't... (LAUGHS) I won't tell that gal Lydia where you live. That's a good one. It's pretty good. You're on. Let's see what you got. Ooh, long and wrong. Did you hit a car? Maybe. Nothing another swing can't take care of. You know? No, no. This ain't the LPGA, you weenie. There's no mulligans. Come on. All right. All right. Matt : Hut! McGill : Get there! Get there! Man, these guys are flat today. (WHISTLE BLOWS) Taylor : All right! Come on! Let's hurry back! I'll tell you what the problem is. Taylor : Come here! McGill : Somebody took the smash out of the Smash. Get over here. It ain't helping. What the hell's wrong with you today? What? What the hell's wrong with you? Pro left 24 pitch. I hit the right gap. Taylor : Yeah, you did fine. Congratulations. You know what, though? Fine doesn't win playoff games. You're out here to win or you go home, understood? I was just doing what I'm told. You know what? Don't talk back to me. You talking back to me? You think you're special? You talk back to me now? Know what I want you to do? I want you to go down to the end zone and you give me 20 suicides. But, Coach... Twenty suicides in the end zone right now, Brian! Let's go, dang it! I want some fire out here! Now let's do something! Matt : Get somebody in there. We're gonna run the slants and the L on one. Ready? Boys : Break! Matt : Set! Sweetheart, not for nothing, but you are tied up in knots right now. You're wound up like a drum. I'm not wound up. Yes, you are. And you know what? That's where Smash is getting it. You know? What the hell is that supposed to mean? Well, I think, you know, style filters down, babe. "Style filters down"? Yeah. What does that mean? It means I know he made a mistake. I know it really pissed you off. It really pissed me off, too. But you know what? He is a boy. He made a mistake. And he is trying so desperately to get back in your good graces. And it seems to me you're so... You're so hard on him that he's losing his confidence. He's losing his passion. And that's not gonna help you one bit on Friday night. Yeah, put those over there. I think you need to talk to him. I think you need to turn that around. Will you put these in the back pantry, please? Tim : Oh, here we go again. I'm actually getting kind of tired of hitting the green every time. Not bad. You're a little quick on your release, though. Thanks, Mr. Nicklaus. I actually would take a swing tip from you if I wasn't kicking your ass right now. You're only two up. There's plenty of golf left to play. Yeah, yeah. Let me ask you something. You feeling the pressure right now? Uh, not really. I've seen you putt. Ready! Set! Go! (CHILDREN CHATTERING) Hey. Mind if I sit down? Uh, no. Go ahead. (SIGHS) Yeah! Yeah! You want me? We used to have a kid like that in the neighborhood when I was growing up. I was that kid. Yeah, I see the resemblance. Yeah! Yeah! The reason I've been so hard on you... Is 'cause I let you down. Look, I appreciate you coming down here, Coach. But I don't need you to like me. Okay? I made peace with that, so I'm gonna just do what I need to do on my own. No, that's not what I want you to do. That's not what football's all about. You wanna fly solo, you go run track. You know, sometimes we take this so serious we lose track of exactly why it is we love this damn game so much. Why it is we play this game. I'm guilty of that. (CHILDREN PLAYING) Hi. Hey. You really Coach Taylor? I am. Well, you get ready for me. I'll be there the first day of practice, 2014. Running back. Remember the name, Coach. Miles Shepherd. Miles Shepherd. Shepherd. Yep. That's my name. All right. I'll tell you what. You give me a call when you get out of peewee. I'll do that, sir. Nice. Smash, you want to play? I need a challenge, dawg. You all want to play some football? Children : Yeah! Let's go. All right, let's do it. If old Smash wants to get his head handed to him. Who's on my team? Who's on my team? Come here, girls. Come here. Cover the left side... Taylor : Hut... Hut! Hut! Hike! Go! Go! Go! Go! Bring it out! Bring it out! Bring it out! Bring it out! Come on, Coach. I'm gonna give you a flag. Yes! That's the ball game right there, boy. Oh, that was a good effort, partner. (LAUGHING) You had me worried there for a minute. (LAUGHING) What? You thought I was just gonna let you win? You know what? If you didn't want to come to the game, you could've just said so. Would've been a lot easier. Listen to me. All right? Uh... This has been... I mean... Seeing you, you coming here, it was great hanging out with you. And you're welcome here anytime. But me going to Dillon? That's a whole different thing. Apparently. It is, Son. It is. Billy was right. I shouldn't have come here in the first place. It was a mistake. Hang on, now. You made the bet, and I beat you fair and square. It was a mistake. Congratulations. Is that what you need right now? Hey, you be a man, be a man. You win, then. You win! Come on and shake my hand. Hey! Timmy! You get back over here and shake my hand! (DOOR OPENING) Hey. How was it? Got the signature. Dad says hi. Can't believe you spent the night. (CAR HORN HONKING) What the hell is that? What's going on? You order up some rally girls? (CHUCKLING) I don't know. Maybe. Hey, Tim. Tim : How you doing, Liz? It's time to go. I'll take some mental notes, Billy. Hey, Matt. Up and at 'em. Time to go! Mrs. Saracen : Help these girls with their fundraiser. What is this? Okay. Bye. (PEOPLE CHATTERING) Susie : That? Sally : Oh, my God. Perfect! That's definitely Mr. October. Yes. Yes. (PEOPLE WHOOPING) Seriously, I don't know if really I can do this. Tim : What don't you know? If Julie finds out about this, there's not... Listen. You're gonna take a few pictures. It's for charity. Yeah, and... Tell me straight up, are you whipped? Oh! Hey, you all didn't tell me I need to bring my own wardrobe. Smash! Hey! Hey, what's up? What's up, Smash? How you doing, Matty? Good. I didn't expect to see you here, man. I didn't know you had it in you, baby. I didn't know you had it in you, baby. Girl : Come on, Matt. You're gonna be my Mr. November. Come on, Matt. Give me a little Hugh Hefner. (PEOPLE CHATTERING) (ALL CHEERING) Matt : Wait, this is seriously... Smash : Hey, save some for me, QB One! Tim : Ever seen a... Whoa! Smash : Oh, oh... Player : It's for charity, Seven. Smash : Come on, Matty. Strike a pose. Tami : It's infuriating. I'm furious. Taylor : I know. I mean, how could the Streets just listen to some lawyer who tells them that they need to sue us? Baby, you know what you're doing, don't you? I know. I'm making it worse. You're making it worse. I know. I know. I need to just calm down. I need to just be supportive. I wanna go with you today, honey. Yes. No. No. I can have my appointments just changed to tomorrow. (GROANS) You know what? There's gonna be... I need that. There are gonna be times when I need you over at the courthouse and times when I don't need you. Believe me. Today I do not need you. It's only gonna be a hearing. If I did need you, I'd let you know. But I love you very much for suggesting it. I'm all good. (SIGHS) But thank you. I know. How you doing? Doing fine, Coach. How you doing? Good. You know we're really not supposed to be talking too much right now. Screw the lawyers. It's not about the case. I heard about you and Lyla. (CLEARS THROAT) I know what I want. I don't see why it's such a big deal. Tell you what. It's not a cure-all. It's the biggest damn commitment you're gonna be making in your life. You all are young. You better make sure. You better make damn sure. Well, I am sure. I am sure. It's her that maybe is not so sure. It seems like she just needs a little time to work some stuff out. No one's telling you you shouldn't get married. What they're saying is, "Just take some time. Feel it out." Who knows, though? You make your future father-in-law happy, you might be able to squeeze a damn big-ass party out of him. (LAUGHS) I do not know about that, sir. You should have seen how pissed off he was when I told him. Was he? You should have seen that big head of his. It was all red. (LAUGHING) Yeah, all right. All right, Coach. Hey, Coach. I'm sorry they're making you do this on game day. It wasn't my choice. See you all in there. Hey. I didn't see you in math. Hey. Um, did, uh... Did you finish the book? I did. What did you do last night? Um, nothing. I just... you know, I just went to work, and then I went home. I saw the calendar. What... What? A bunch of the rally girls were passing it around this morning. No, see, they totally kidnapped me, like, with Riggins the other night. (STAMMERING) But nothing happened. (STAMMERING) So, it's... Nothing happened at all. But why'd you lie about it? I don't know. That was dumb. My head is just all foggy for some reason. Can't imagine why. Oh, Julie. I'm sorry. Okay? You know what? I'm sorry, too. No, don't say that. I'm sorry for trusting you, but I don't appreciate getting lied to. So why don't you go with your little rally girls and your football friends and just leave me alone? (KNOCKS) I'm sorry. I was on the other side of campus. You wanted to see me, Coach? (SMASH PANTING) You're starting at tailback tonight. What the hell? You want a hug or something? Get out of here. (DOOR CLOSES) Go ahead. (COACHES CHATTERING) Oh, Lord God, we just ask that you be with us on the field tonight, God. We just ask that you just inspire us to greatness right now, God. We ask that you protect us, O Lord. We ask that you make us proud in defeat and humble in victory. But either way, God, we just ask that you be with us, God. You know how much we've been through this season, God. And you know that this game is the key to our destiny, God. So we just ask that you give us courage right now, God. We just ask that you give us strength right now, God. We ask that you bless each hand that we hold and bless all the fans and everybody out there under those lights tonight, God. Amen. Panthers : Amen! It's already done, baby. It's already done, baby! Smash : Put it up. Put it up! Put it up! Smash : Clear eyes. Full hearts. Panthers : Can't lose! I said clear eyes. Full hearts. Can't lose! Clear eyes. Full hearts. Can't lose! Come on, baby! Let's go! Panthers : Yeah! Go! Billy : Tim! Hey, Tim! Look, I need an extra ticket. Too bad, Billy. The game's about to start. You know that. Tim! What? Dad's here.
