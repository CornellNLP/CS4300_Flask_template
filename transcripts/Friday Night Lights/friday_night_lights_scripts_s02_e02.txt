 Where the hell is your father? 
 Take a deep breath. 
 You look good. 
 Thanks. 
 Probably because yesterday I was baptized and accepted Jesus as my Lord and Savior. 
 Enjoy Jesus. 
 Enjoy your depraved hedonism. 
 Say hi to the Swede! 
 Who's the Swede? 
 Some boy she's flirting with at the pool. 
 If you leave Matt, no one is gonna love you any less. 
 You realize that. 
 I really miss having you around. 
 Maybe it's colic. 
 Honey, it's not colic. 
 Well, Julie, she was colic. 
 I love you so much, but you don't know what you're talking about. 
 Julie was not colicky. 
 The only time Julie ever cried was the time you slammed her hand. 
 That was 15 years ago, and you're the one who let her... 
 You know what, were you asleep when I called? 
 No. 
 Yes, you were. Go back to sleep. 
 No sense in me going back to sleep now that I'm awake. 
 Go ahead and talk to me. 
 All right, darling, how's work going? 
 It's good. 
 That doesn't sound very convincing. 
 It's good, it's good. 
 It's like being... you know... 
 This bed's uncomfortable, for one thing. 
 And the other thing is, that, it's like being the new kid in school. 
 There's this inner circle, you're never part of it. 
 All you have to do is be indispensable. 
 And you and I both know that's just what you do so perfect. 
 That's a very wifely thing for you to say. 
 Oh, now you got her crying. 
 I miss you and I love you. 
 I love you, baby. I love you. 
 Bye-bye. 
 Landry, what-- what time is it? 
 Why are you calling me? 
 Look, I can't find my watch. 
 What? 
 I can't-- 
 I can't find my watch. 
 The last time I had it was... 
 Even if somebody found that watch, they're not gonna know is yours, okay? 
 That's fine, Tyra, except for the fact that it's engraved "to Landry from grandpa." 
 It's probably with the body. 
 Can you take a deep breath and calm down? 
 I could but that's not gonna matter when I'm in the electric chair. 
 Okay, Landry, this is not normal, what we're doing right here. 
 I'm sorry if I'm embarrassing you right now. 
 No, you're not embarrassing me. 
 We're not supposed to return to the crime scene. 
 I didn't realize you were so knowledgeable about this. 
 Maybe you should just write a how-to book... 
 That's helping right now. 
 Those nasty comments, that's great. 
 I'm trying to hold it together. 
 Think anyone's looking for him? 
 Friends or family or someone? 
 Let's go home. 
 Come on. 
 Let's go. 
 Let's go. Watch your footwork! 
 Eyes up! 
 Hey Aaron! 
 Yeah? 
 Coach wants to see ya. 
 All right, keep it up. 
 I do wind sprints and gasses... 
 Coaches... Antoine. 
 Antoine here is in trouble with the infractions committee for accepting gifts from a booster. 
 Isn't that right, Antoine? 
 Taylor, I need for you to escort this knucklehead to his hearing tomorrow because I don't trust that he can make it there on his own. 
 We fully expect him to be suspended for the season because he was stupid enough to get caught at the Justin Timberlake show with an agent. 
 Justin Timberlake. 
 Hope it was worth it, Antoine. 
 Step off. 
 Little white boy's got soul. 
 I don't wanna hear another word out of you. 
 What about, uh... 
 I mean, how about practice? 
 Don't worry about it. We'll cover it. 
 All right, since we got that covered, we taking my car. 
 Hello. 
 Hey, Glen, come on in. 
 Gosh, thank you so much for seeing me at home like this. 
 You're welcome. Let's just go on on the kitchen there, okay? 
 Okay. 
 You can probably find a spot on the table. 
 Really, again, thank you for seeing me at your home. 
 That's probably an inconvenience to you. 
 It's fine. 
 I mean these kids, there's so many of them. You know, they're coming at me like ninjas. 
 I know. They do that. 
 Wow, I hope you didn't go to all is trouble just for me. 
 I just had a baby, Glen. 
 I'm-- I was kidding. I'm sorry. 
 What's the problem? 
 Let's just go over it. 
 Okay, um, Barry Harby... 
 Barry Harby Jr. Linebacker. 
 Right. 
 He's telling you he can't read? 
 He said he can't. 
 The football players are gonna mess with you. 
 He's just trying to get into an easier english class. 
 You can't let these kids ride roughshod all over you. 
 Who's next? 
 Right, Tiffany Barnes. 
 Tiffany Barnes. 
 She wants you to write her a recommendation? 
 Yeah, she does. To Vassar. 
 To Vassar. 
 She can't get into Vassar any more than I can get into my old jeans. 
 You see what I'm saying? 
 Absolutely. 
 How's she doing with the divorce of her parents? 
 I have no idea. 
 Look, I'm a science teacher. 
 I teach science. 
 And I'm a little out of element, you know? 
 And I don't know if there's any general words of wisdom that you can give me. or if you have a book or anything I could read. Or you could refer me... 
 It's just-- you need to just connect with these children, that's all there is to it. 
 Hey hon! 
 You know what, listen, I was thinking tonight, if you wanted to, you and Matt could rent a movie and order in some food, and you could bring it over here, have a little date night. 
 What is it with you? 
 Matt this, Matt that. 
 You know Matt has his own life, right? 
 Who's next? 
 Please hurry up! We're already late. 
 Can we please just go? 
 I don't know if we're supposed to pick Julie up or not. 
 I left her, like, four messages and she never called me back. 
 So I don't know... 
 Maybe if we just go by her house see if she's there, and if she's there, then we're supposed to get her. And if she's not... 
 We could do that. Or maybe your testicles are just in her panty drawer, Matt. 
 Have you ever thought about that? 
 Even I know that she's-- 
 What is that... 
 How you doing? 
 Good. 
 Should I sign for it? 
 Hey, thanks. 
 Grandma, what'd you order? 
 Is that my tiara? 
 Tiara? 
 Is it? 
 Look how pretty! 
 That'll be beautiful for whenever you just zip over to the rite aid. 
 Grandma, no. It was $2,400. 
 We gotta send this back. 
 Look how pretty. 
 Beautiful. 
 It's really pretty, but it's really gotta go back. 
 Oh, boys. 
 Look at... Look at her. 
 You can't put a price tag on happiness. 
 And again, we're glad to have coach Mcgregor here. 
 Came out of those hills of Tennessee to the great state of Texas. 
 Thank you, Buddy. 
 Oh, again, season opener pep rally is coming up. 
 And I'm proud to say that Garrity motors will sponsor and host as we have so many years in the past. 
 Buddy... 
 We've all been talking. 
 We thought it'd be nice if we had a new venue this year. 
 Well, what do you mean we've all been talking? 
 Well, Lester's got his ranch. 
 There's a lot of space indoors and out. 
 We can barbeque, make it a family affair. 
 You know, make it, I don't know, more wholesome. 
 Garrity motors is wholesome. 
 Buddy, you got a lot going on right now. 
 What does that mean, Lester? 
 Buddy, it's just a party. It'll be fun. 
 I sure hope you can make it. 
 Look, I need that in-home care that you promised me, all right? 
 I call y'all people once... 
 You gonna get the door? 
 I call y'all people once a week. 
 Checking in on it. I'm taking care of my grandmother who-- yeah, I'll hold. 
 You want me to talk to 'em? 
 You're obviously not getting-- 
 I'm on hold, you can't really talk to 'em. 
 Like 30 minutes... 
 Hey, Julie. 
 Um, I didn't know if you needed a ride. 
 So I called you a couple times. 
 Oh, I'm sorry, my phone was dead. 
 Oh, all right. 
 I got a ride with Lois. 
 Okay, well, do you wanna maybe... 
 You wanna do something? 
 Yeah, um, give me a call later, okay? 
 Okay. 
 See you later. 
 Hello? 
 Christ, shield me today from wounding. 
 Christ with me, Christ before me. 
 Christ behind me, Christ in me. 
 Christ on my right, Christ on my left. 
 Christ above me, Christ beneath me. 
 Christ when I lay down, and in our hearts. 
 Christ in our families. 
 Christ in the hearts of everyone who thinks of us. 
 And Christ in the mouths of everyone who speaks of us. 
 Blue 20! 
 All right! 
 Good catch, Smash! 
 See that boy? Thing of beauty! 
 Way to go, Smash! 
 Saracen. Saracen. 
 It was a good toss, all right? 
 Good read, Saracen. 
 Coach! 
 Am I a thing of beauty, too? 
 Let me ask you something, Riggins. 
 Can you count to 50? 
 Yeah. 
 Good. 
 Then I got 50 for you, right over there. 
 Hit it! Let's go! 
 50 good ones. Let's go! 
 Come on! Come on! 
 Let's get it on! Let's go! 
 Blue 20! Blue 20! 
 Come on, Clark! Let's run this thing again! 
 Blue 20, blue 20! 
 Feet on the ground, son! Get your feet on the ground! 
 You gonna slap his ass upside down! 
 Come on, son! 
 Dig a little deeper, all right, boy? 
 You're on offense. 
 All right, shake it off now. 
 Dad. 
 Looking good out there. 
 You sure you talking about my-- 
 I was just getting my ass handed to me by Riggins, like, five times in a row. 
 I can't really feel my right ear for some reason. 
 Give it time. You're on the team. 
 That's all that matters. 
 I'm real proud of you. I mean it. 
 Alright. 
 Pretty good. 
 I know, right? 
 What do you think it means? 
 You're still recovering from your injury. 
 You've been great about your physical therapy. 
 And that's some of the reasons your muscles are coming back. 
 This improvement in your hands, it's wonderful. 
 But it's no necessarily indicative of anything else, if that's what you're thinking. 
 Yeah, but who's the say that-- 
 Jason, I am. 
 You're not gonna walk again, Jason. 
 At least not without a major medical breakthrough. 
 And it is something we are still years away from. 
 Hey dude, what's up? 
 Same old crap. 
 He just told me I'll never walk again. 
 Again. 
 Depressing as usual, eh? 
 I just thought... 
 I know this guy. 
 He does some experimental stem cell surgeries down in Mexico. 
 Heard they're doing really good with it. 
 And kick. And kick. 
 All right, bring that knee... 
 This is my house! 
 I need you out of here! This is my exercise time! 
 Did you hear me? I said get out! 
 Help! 
 Get out of my house! 
 Get out! 
 Gramma-- 
 Thank goodness, Matthew. 
 She tried to turn off my tv! 
 Who tried to turn off-- 
 She did. 
 See, grandma, there's nobody here-- 
 No, there. 
 Okay, who are you? 
 Carlotta, Carlotta Alonso. 
 Don't let her throw away my tapioca. 
 The in-home nurse you demanded. 
 This is junk. 
 That's what I have every night. 
 I need to get rid of this tv. 
 Oh no no no, see-- 
 Oh, get out of my house! 
 I can't. It's my job. 
 We tend to keep the tv on. 
 'cause it seems to be the only thing that calms her down. 
 It's destroying her mind. 
 I'm sorry, but a lot of things are going to have to change. 
 Like? 
 Where am I supposed to sleep? 
 What do you mean, sleep? 
 I mean sleep. I'm going to live here. 
 What you doing, coach? 
 Tell me what you're gonna say to the committee. 
 I got it down, no worries. 
 Good, let's hear it. 
 Nah, coach, I want it to sound spontaneous. 
 You know, from the heart. 
 That's great, so let's hear it then. 
 Be spontaneous. 
 All right. 
 I'm sorry that I took those tickets to Justin Timberlake. 
 Especially when they didn't have no cristal in the box! 
 Can you believe that? 
 I don't drink no cheap stuff. 
 That's real funny. 
 You know what's not in your little speech, though? 
 What's that, coach? 
 Put a little contrition into it. 
 You know what that is? 
 I got an idea. But that's probably because I'm not sorry. 
 You're not sorry. 
 No, sir, I'm not. 
 You hear that, America? 
 I'm not sorry! How about that? 
 Tell me, hot shot, you payed for this car all yourself? 
 Oh yeah. All by myself. 
 You pay for all that nice jewelry by yourself? 
 Yes, sir, I got a paper route. 
 Oh, come on, coach! 
 Everybody know we take stuff! 
 Look, I play football! 
 Hell, they should be paying me. 
 I bring a million dollars to this school every year. 
 Shoot, this stuff started for me when I was in pee wee. 
 I got a ice cream. 
 Hey, baby, how you doing? 
 Everything's fine. 
 Me and Gracie are out for a walk, walking to school. 
 And in fact, Gracie has a couple of words for you. Hold on. 
 Don't do that. Now's not the time. 
 Talk to your daddy. 
 Hello, it's dad. 
 It's daddy. I love you, Grace. 
 I love you. Dad loves you. 
 Hey, I love you. 
 Now, let me talk to mom. Tammy, hello? 
 I gotta go. 
 I'll call you back-- bye. 
 I-- what? 
 I just wanna ask you one thing. 
 What you doing in the car with me when you have a new baby? 
 You don't just open the door, Buddy. 
 This is not your house anymore. 
 What are all my trophies doing out in the front? 
 I don't want 'em anymore. 
 You get 'em out of here by Sunday or they're going in the garbage. 
 And you're early. 
 Yeah, five minutes. 
 Can I come in my house? 
 No. You know what, frankly, Buddy? 
 I don't think feel safe. 
 I'm sorry, Pam, about the other night. 
 You know... I admit, I lost it. 
 I just, uh... 
 You know, a man can only be pushed so far. 
 Don't you even dare talk to me about being pushed, Buddy. 
 I am the victim here. 
 I think it's about time for us to lose the victim stuff. 
 You're too much-- 
 I can't believe you! 
 Mom. 
 Come on, dad, let's get this over with. 
 Okay. Hey, Bud. 
 Hey, Thabs, let's go. 
 Hey, what's that, a soccer ball? 
 Yeah. 
 All right, let's do it. 
 Gonna have some fun! 
 There's always, like, a middle man of bands. 
 You gotta get songs written. 
 I always have problems with lights. 
 And I always want a smoke machine or something like that. 
 How often do you get a smoke machine in a place with a band, right? 
 Thank you. 
 Hey, what are you doing? 
 Just picking up my paycheck. 
 Okay. 
 So where did you go the other night? 
 Oh, um, I actually-- 
 I had another party to go to. 
 Oh, cool. Ah, no. 
 I mean, someone had said they saw you get picked up by your dad or something. 
 That was my older friend. 
 Yeah. 
 But I got a lot of studying to do, so I'll, uh... I'll see you around. 
 Oh, that's right. School started, huh? 
 Yeah. 
 Okay. 
 So... So I guess this is good-bye? 
 I guess it is. 
 All right, well, hey, don't go growing up too fast, 'cause you're gonna be a heartbreaker. 
 Guys are just gonna be busting down your doors, so watch out. 
 So I'll see you around, kid. 
 Hey, Glen. 
 Hope you don't mind. We just dropped by. 
 I'm gonna plop down on your couch right now. 
 I'm exhausted. 
 I just walked all the way from my house. 
 You walked all the way from your house? 
 Yeah, we did. It is boiling hot. 
 Yeah, it's 105 degrees out there. 
 That's completely insane. 
 Well, it's not insane when you have a baby who won't stay quiet unless you're movin' her all the time. 
 And I figured I'd kill two birds with one stone. 
 Right. 
 What's your problem with that, Glen? 
 It's no problem, it's just that you're profusely sweating, you got a newborn baby. 
 You're walking in 105-degree temperature. 
 You're perspiring. It's your glands. 
 I'm sorry, I don't need you talking about my perspiration. 
 I don't need you talking about my glands. 
 I came to talk about the job. 
 Which you might need a little bit of help with. 
 I might need a little bit of help with it. 
 I'm really not qualified to be doing it. 
 But I think what's more important is your behavior, you bringing this baby here. 
 I'm concerned about the baby's health. 
 It could get sick here. 
 Excuse me, Let me tell you something right now. 
 Right here and right now. 
 This isn't my first barbeque, Glen, all right? 
 So I don't appreciate you going on and on and on about what a bad mother I am. 
 I'm not trying to say that you're a bad mother. 
 Oh, really? 
 That's what it sounds like to me. 
 I'm not trying to say that you're a bad mother. 
 What I am saying, although... 
 Now look... 
 I'm afraid to say it to you right now, because, frankly, you frighten me a little bit. 
 You got a lot of nerve. 
 I'm just trying to help. Well, no, I was trying to help. I was trying to help by coming over here which I think you need a little bit of help. So don't you go and you judge me on what kind of mother I'm being. 
 How dare you? 
 That's not what I was trying to do. 
 Well, how dare you? 
 'Cause that's what it sounded like. 
 I'm sorry. 
 I'm not trying to upset you or... 
 Well, too late. 
 This is just a bad idea. 
 You know what, you just go on and do your job. 
 You want something to drink? You want some water or something? 
 You know what, I'm gonna get you a glass of water, okay? 
 
 
 
 Hey, uh. Julie, it's Matt. Um, you told me to call later. And it's later, so I'm calling. Anyways, call me back. And then I'll talk to you later. Bye. 
 Sorry, Gracie. 
 There's a bump. 
 Hey, Mrs. Taylor! 
 Hey hey! Jason Street. How you doing? 
 I'm good. How are you? 
 Great, never better. 
 Awesome. 
 I was wondering if I could have-- 
 See baby Gracie? 
 Hi, Gracie. 
 I was wondering if I could have a second of your time? 
 Sure. No problem. 
 We're just walking home. 
 I've been having this dream lately. 
 A lot. And you're in it. 
 So in the dream you tell me to get up and walk. 
 And I do. 
 I walk 'cause you told me to. 
 You make me walk. 
 Really? 
 Yeah. 
 And one day after having the dream, I found out I could do this again. 
 I can make a fist with my right hand. 
 Which I couldn't do before. 
 And I still can't do it with my left, but... 
 That's great, that's great, Jason. 
 I just wanna talk to you, 'cause I feel like... 
 Like it really means something. 
 I think it means I'm gonna walk again. 
 Soon. 
 How about that? 
 So, uh, anyway, I guess I just want to say thank you. 
 You have a great day. Bye, Gracie. 
 You're welcome. I'm so glad I got to see you today. 
 Me too. 
 You have a great day, Mrs. Taylor! Thank you. 
 Hurry up, let's go. 
 Let me ask you something, coach. 
 You got that baby on a schedule? 
 Oh, wait, you wouldn't know that, would you? 
 No, but seriously, how's your wife feel about being alone with the baby? 
 That was a question, coach. 
 Hurry up, let's go. 
 Look at that scowl. 
 I gotta get a picture of this. 
 Hold on. 
 I'm gonna send this to your baby. 
 Think everything's a damn joke, don't you? 
 It's all a big damn joke to you. 
 All the talent you got, what do you use it for, huh? 
 Getting free stuff and letting your team down. 
 You know what my opinion is? 
 You don't deserve to play the game. 
 What do you think about that? 
 Who do you think you're talking to? 
 You let your team down, you let yourself down. And you don't care You don't care if you finish out the season. 
 'cause I'm sure big ol' Antoine, he's got it all figured out. 
 He's got a backup plan, doesn't he? 
 Who am I talking to? 
 Who am I? 
 Who the hell are you? 
 Oh, hey, Landry. 
 I just wanted to say congratulations on making the football team. 
 I'm actually sort of your rally girl. 
 Sort of my rally... 
 Yeah. 
 So you're my rally girl? 
 Wow, Landry. 
 Your own personal rally girl. 
 I guess you've arrived. 
 Anyway, we can work out the details later. 
 I just wanted to say hi. 
 You think that all human beings are capable of evil? 
 I'm gonna borrow him for a second. 
 I mean, obviously some are. 
 I was asking her a question. 
 You don't have to rip me away. 
 I'm not a little kid. 
 You don't have to hold my arm. 
 Bye, thank you. 
 Bye. What the hell are you doing? 
 What am I doing? 
 Yeah. Are you insane? 
 You have got to hold it together. 
 Do you have no empathy about anything, Tyra? 
 So you have ice water running through your veins? 
 A human being is dead because of me. 
 And what are you doing? 
 You're out having a great time. 
 And you know what, he was a rapist, okay? 
 Stop acting like he was some kind of a saint. 
 I'm not acting like-- 
 Act like a man then! 
 Want me to act like a man. 
 Yeah. 
 See, that's real easy for you to say, because you're not the one who killed him, are you? 
 You don't have to think about that. 
 You don't have to close your eyes and hear the sound of his skull cracking every time you go to sleep, do you? 
 Don't tell me to act like a man. 
 Because the thing about this is, I would do that again for you in a second because he hurt you and because I'm in love with you. 
 And don't-- Don't look at me like that. 
 All right, don't. Because you know. 
 You've known forever. 
 It's not some big secret, all right? 
 Let's not pretend that this was some great thing that we did. 
 And let's-- just don't tell me to become a man, all right? 
 Because if that's your definition of a man, that's extremely sad. 
 All right? 
 Look, gentlemen, I'm not here to make excuses. 
 I mean, everybody makes mistakes. 
 I made one. A big one. 
 And I'm sorry for that. 
 I should know better, my mom raised me better than that. 
 And I swear to you, on the Bible, I promise you it won't happen again. 
 I wasn't raised that way. I know better. 
 But it was a mistake. 
 All I wanna do is play ball. 
 It's been my dream... to make it to the NFL. 
 Gentlemen, whether he plays at TMU or not, Antoine Beltrane's gonna go the NFL. 
 That's my opinion. 
 He's either gonna go as a selfish, undisciplined punk, or you can allow us to shape him into what I believe he could be. 
 The problem's systemic. 
 It's a culture in football that's been allowed to have a life of its own. 
 It's no great secret. 
 I mean, he's not the only prima donna. 
 The fact of the matter is, we're asking for one year to drill some sense into the kid. 
 Take away his iPhone. 
 Take away his cars,. his ridiculous jewelry, and all the other crap. 
 And we make his life miserable for a season. 
 He's gonna be representing us, and I propose that our responsibility lies in doing better by Antoine Beltrane. 
 Okay, see, with this my grandma likes to have newspapers, magazines, 'cause then she can read it. 
 One time I had a client who never threw anything away. 
 She was crushed to death under a pile of newspapers. 
 It that what you want, Matt? 
 No. 
 I can't live here unless it's clean. 
 Okay. 
 We, that means you, should install a guard rail on the steps. 
 The thing we have to be careful of at her age is falling down. 
 And we're all going to have dinner together from now on. 
 Okay, look, that's great. But what about her mind? 
 Like, how are we gonna help... 
 Yeah, she's a little cuckoo. 
 She needs structure. 
 She needs the tv off. 
 She needs crossword puzzles and walks and conversation. 
 Okay, but-- whoa, hey, where are you going? 
 You people may have a mildew problem. 
 Okay, look, this is my room, so... 
 Did you draw this? 
 Yeah. Can I have it back, please? 
 What's the matter? It's good. 
 Thanks, but this is my room, so I think... 
 It's kind of depressing. 
 You need some new curtains. 
 Curtains? 
 How old are these sheets? 
 I don't know. 
 Help me move the bed. 
 No, we're not moving the-- no. 
 Really, Matt? 
 Haven't you heard of the internet? 
 Yeah, that's funny. 
 That's funny, thanks. 
 I mean... 
 Baby, you are hot. 
 Hey, Jules, come here and feel her, tell me if you think she's hot. 
 Um, I really don't know anything about babies. 
 I'm sorry. 
 But Lois is outside waiting, so I really gotta go. 
 Well, be home by 10:00, please. 
 All right, I love you. 
 Love you. 
 Gracie, now, don't do this to. 
 Yeah? 
 Coach, you wanted to see me? 
 Ah, come on in, Taylor. 
 Three games. 
 Sir? 
 Antoine Beltrane's only gonna be out three games. 
 Well... that's good. 
 You're damn right it is. 
 He said you put on quite a show up there. 
 He also said that you hollered at him pretty good. 
 He kind of has that effect on people. 
 I bet you were one hell of a high school coach, Taylor. 
 I appreciate that, coach. 
 Thank you. 
 How are you doing? 
 I'm doing good. 
 So have you made it a point of stalking me or something? 
 No. 
 Just a lucky coincidence. 
 What are you doing? 
 I am debugging my friend's windshield. 
 No, I mean tonight. 
 What are you all dressed up for? 
 Oh, um, it's the big Panther pep rally. 
 Oh, yeah! 
 Oh, man, that sounds like fun. 
 Yeah, you have no idea. 
 I'm sure I don't. 
 Well, you know what? Why don't you hop in? 
 I'll take you in the most majestic vehicle on earth. 
 Come on, really. 
 I'll give you a ride. 
 Okay. 
 I just gotta go tell Lois, though. 
 Yeah. 
 We're happy to have you all come out here. 
 And we especially wanna thank you for coming out to my ranch here tonight. 
 We really, really appreciate it. 
 And now the minute you've all been waiting for, you guys! 
 It's time to meet the 2006 
 Dillon high school State champions! 
 Hey baby, y'all ready for some Smash ball? 
 Oh, my God. 
 Yeah, I used to have a place like this once, too, but I sold it for this van. 
 So this is how you guys throw a party. 
 Let's just say that football isn't lost on Dillon. 
 Well, hey, it was nice seeing you again. 
 Yeah. Thanks for the ride. 
 It was good stuff. 
 Um, next time you wanna... 
 You can call me sometime. 
 I'm sorry, did I miss your thing? 
 Yeah. 
 Doesn't matter. 
 It's the Smash show, anyway. 
 Look, I think we really need to talk. 
 Okay. 
 Talk. 
 I just think that... 
 That maybe we've changed or something. 
 The point is, it's me. It's not you. 
 You didn't do anything. 
 I know I didn't do anything. 
 I know it's not me. 
 I know it's-- 
 I know it's the Swede. 
 No, it's not the Swede. 
 But how about just be honest with me? 
 Just tell me the truth. 
 It's just... 
 It's the Swede, it's my parents, it's me feeling trapped. 
 It's me turning into my mom. 
 It's just... I don't know. 
 Nothing seems right anymore. 
 And I just really need some space. 
 Oh, Lester. 
 Yeah, no, Garrity-- 
 Garrity Mortors is not good enough. 
 It's not wholesome. 
 This is wholesome. 
 This is Lester's wholesome trophy room. didn't even shoot one of these damn animals. Probably. 
 And here is Mr. Lester out there. 
 Working that hillbilly. 
 Work that old ridge runnin' hillbilly mouth breather. 
 So, there's 14 seconds left, rain's coming down hard. 
 Jimmy Carter's the President, the country is depressed.

 By God, it's time to win the State championship. 
 Tt's time for Buddy Garrity to get this thing done, You know what I'm saying? 
 It's like... it's... 
 Lester, come over here. 
 You gotta hear this. 
 This is the State championship game. 
 14 seconds left. 
 It's gotta be a run-pass option. 
 Okay. 
 You got Speeze on that side. 
 I got Nippy on that side. 
 Let me get that. 
 No, I'm telling the story! 
 So I'm in the center. 
 I got Billy right here, and I go back.

 He's not. 
 He's just sad, that's all. 
 He made his bed. 
 How you doing? 
 I'm okay. 
 You? 
 I'm great. 
 You better go. 
 You probably have a three-way to get to or something. 
 Good night, Lyla. 
 All right, Tammy, make sure she's getting enough fluids. 
 Offer her formula after you breastfeed. 
 And she needs to eat once every hour, okay? 
 Maybe you and your husband can take shifts. 
 Yeah, that's not gonna happen. 
 She's gonna be fine. 
 Okay. 
 Do you have anybody you can call? 
 Maybe you shouldn't drive yourself home. 
 Babe, she's fine. I swear. 
 The doctor brought her fever right down. 
 And she's starting to sleep now. 
 She's nice and quiet. 
 No, I don't want you running home. 
 You just stay. Sit tight where you are. 
 I don't want you coming back here, honey. 
 Honey, I'm fine, I swear. 
 And she's good. 
 It's trip to the emergency room. 
 You know how many times Julie got dragged over here?

 Thank you for coming. 
 You-- are you okay? yeah, I'm good. 
 So she's waking up on you. 
 I'm sorry. 
 You're so sweet. 
 I'm sorry, I know it's late.

 I wasn't doing anything. 
 You're so sweet, and I didn't have anybody else to call. 
 Thank you very much. 
 I really appreciate it. 
 You're real nice. 
 I'm sorry I was kind of a bitch to you. 
 I'm just a little emotional at the moment. 
 You weren't a bitch to me at all. 
 It's fine. It's really no big deal. 
 You're so sweet. Thank you. 
 You have everything? 
 I think so, yeah. 
 Okay, let's go. 
 Okay, sweetheart. 
 That's a beautiful baby. 
 Thank you. 
 Hey, you know, this might not be any of my business. 
 I'm not trying to step over the line, but this whole ordeal, this living apart from your husband thing? 
 What was the point of that exactly? 
 I don't know. 
 That was just my idea. 
 It was just a stupid idea. 
 How did you get in here? 
 I'm glad he's dead. 
 God, I... 
 You know, he wasn't gonna stop. 
 He was just gonna keep on doing that to me. 
 You know, maybe something's wrong with me, but I am... 
 I am so glad he's dead. 
 I just, um... 
 I wish I was the one who killed him. 
 Don't-- Don't say that. 
 No. 
 Don't. 
 You are the best guy I have ever known-- 
 Stop No, and if anything happens to you because of me, I would never forgive myself. 
 I am so sorry. 
 Oh, nah. Don't be sorry. 
 There's nothing to be sorry about. 
 It's all right. We're gonna be fine. 
 Stop. 
 We're gonna be okay. Okay? 
 We're gonna be okay.
