 We're moving again, aren't we? 
 Your father was offered an amazing job at TMU in Austin. 
 Well, that's good. 
 That's good. 
 Because guess what? 
 I'm not going. 
 I got a girlfriend who cheated on me, I got parents who are breaking up 'cause of some stupid lawsuit! 
 I lost the coach, lost the quad rugby! 
 So I got nothing! 
 A bi-polar disorder? 
 It can be dangerous sometimes. 
 People get really depressed. Even suicidal. 
 Hut! 
 Backside pressure! 
 There you go. 
 You ever think about coaching? 
 (MARK GRUNTS) 
 (TYRA WHIMPERS) 
 Get in the truck! 
 Bitch! 
 (SCREAMS) 
 He tried to rape me. 
 Wait, who? What? 
 (TYRA CRYING) 
 Tami : Honey? 
 Honey? 
 Honey. Wake up. 
 What... What time is it? 
 No, you're all right. 
 You're all right. 
 You haven't missed your flight yet. 
 It's not 4:00 yet. 
 So then go back to sleep. 
 Sweetheart? 
 Hmm. 
 I just woke up with the worst feeling that we shouldn't move to Austin. 
 That's cold feet. 
 You just don't... 
 It's cold feet. 
 Well, maybe it is. But, sweetheart... 
 What? 
 When you go into TMU today, please just don't commit to them. I just... 
 Okay. 
 Did you hear me? 
 Uh-huh. 
 You sure? 
 Yes, I hear you. 
 I'm gonna kill you. 
 Sweetheart... 
 Bo : Mom. 
 Mom, I'm hungry. 
 (KNOCK ON DOOR) 
 Tim : Hold on. 
 Bo : I want French toast. 
 Mom! 
 (DOG BARKING) 
 Mom. Come on. 
 Okay. Okay. I'm coming. 
 (KNOCK ON DOOR) 
 Yeah. I know who. 
 Bo... 
 Who could it be? 
 Tim! You're up early. 
 That's because we're gonna start training. 
 Oh, boy. 
 All right? 
 You ready for this? 
 Oh, yeah. 
 Are you sure? 
 Oh, yeah. 
 You ready? 
 Let's go just left. 
 A nice tight left. 
 Nice. Maybe to the throat? 
 (BO GRUNTS) 
 Tim : Nice. 
 Man : First of all, Eric, we're very excited to have you here. 
 Well, I'm glad to be here, I'll tell you. 
 Guy with the reputation that you've got, with the accomplishments that you've had at the high school level,  the way you developed those young kids,  we think that you would be an unbelievable addition to our staff here. 
 Eric : Well, I appreciate that. I know a couple weeks ago we talked, and the offer's been out on the table for a week, Eric. Well, I know. I understand that. Are you having second thoughts? Well, no. I'm not having second thoughts. It's just a matter of... Well, you guys understand. You don't want the news to get out. We got a championship game coming up. Well, I'm gonna be really honest with you, Eric. I've got another guy. He's been offered three jobs at three different universities. We've come to the point where we can't risk losing our second choice while you're making this decision. We've gotta know something and we've gotta know it now or we've gotta withdraw our offer. Gentlemen, I accept. (KNOCKING ON DOOR) Tyra : I'm coming. Landry? You're not in school? (STAMMERING) No. I ditched calculus. It's no big deal. You ditched a class? Have you ever in your life ditched a day of class? Yeah. Been like a few times... No. I didn't think so. But I noticed you weren't at school today or yesterday, so I just wanted to see how you were... No, you don't. I mean, I just wanted to see if maybe you'd talked to anyone about this, like maybe your mom or... No. No, my mom happens to be in the boonies with my aunt who's dying of ovarian cancer, so, you know there's bigger things going on. Sorry. Yeah, well. Well, I mean, there's gotta be someone that you can tell about this... No. I mean, like some kind of relative... Landry, there's no one! Okay? It's nobody's damn business, so don't go telling anybody. You understand? Yeah. Just forget about it. Bradley : Man, I just don't see why we gotta go to this stupid roast anyways, you know? Smash : What you mean stupid? I feel you on that, man. We are athletes. We are not comedians. You know what I'm saying? That's why it's funny, 'cause y'all suck. Look. How about this one? When Matty first became QB, he was so shy he had to e-mail all his plays. Like I said, y'all suck. Hey, say that again. No, say that again. Say that to my face! No, I'm sorry! I'm sorry! Baby, baby, can I talk to you for a second? (BELL RINGING) Can I talk to you for a second? Listen, about the banquet... Roast. Whatever. I don't think I can go. What you talking about? You're my date. Look, the Smash don't fly solo. Okay, I know that the Smash has his ways and everything, but I just... I feel like with everything I'm going through right now, it's just... It's too much. Baby, it's sitting and eating. I mean, how is that too much? Just trust, okay? It's gonna stress me out and I need to stay calm and focused. I need structure right now. Okay. Thanks for understanding. Come on. We'll work on your jokes. All right. Thank you very much. Hey. Suzy : Hey. What are you doing here? Well, what are you doing here? I asked you first. Well, I live here in Dillon. So I'm here to get some paperwork filled out 'cause you are now looking at a gainfully-employed assistant football coach for the Dillon Panthers. No way! Yes. Oh, cool. Now you. What are you doing here? Oh, a ticket. You know, get a traffic ticket in Dillon, you gotta pay it in Dillon. Well, how long are you here for? A couple weeks. I'm helping my sister paint and get her place... That's nice of you. Yeah. Couple of weeks? Couple of weeks. Well, if you got any downtime while you're here, then... Oh, anything to get me out of that house. Well, then we should see a movie or dinner or something. Catch up. Sounds like a date. Not a date. A plan? A plan. Yes. An arrangement. An arrangement. So Thursday? Thursday would be great. All right. Great. All right. Cool. Well, Thursday it is, then, for the arrangement. Take care. Okay. Yeah. You, too. And I'll see you then. Bye. Thursday. (KNOCKING ON DOOR) Hey. What's going on, man? Not much, but I gotta... First you miss mud bowl and then I can barely even get you on the phone. How'd it go? I mean, what happened? How'd what go? The big study date with Tyra Collette. You know, it went fine. Fine? Look, I gotta... Well, did you confess your love to her? This is all just some kind of big joke, isn't it, Matt? Landry's got a big crush on Tyra. I'm just here for the comic relief for the star quarterback? No. That's not it. I'm just curious how it... What happened? What's wrong? You promise not to tell anyone if I tell you this? You're not gonna say a word about it to anyone? Yeah. You're not gonna tell Julie, you're not gonna tell anyone about this if I tell you? No, I'm not gonna tell Julie anything. What? Well, look, there was an assault. What do you mean, an assault? I was late, and then there was this guy, some stranger that attacked Tyra outside the Alamo Freeze. And then tried to do stuff. Is she okay? Well, yeah. I mean, she fought him off, so I... Well, what did the cops say? She didn't want to tell the cops, so we... So who'd you tell? Well, she didn't want anyone to know. I mean... She just wanted to, you know, not make a big deal about it and just... Matt, look... You just... She just wants to kind of... (STAMMERING) I have no idea... I mean, she swore me to secrecy, Matt. So what am I supposed to do, Matt? What? Tell me what I'm supposed to do in this situation. You gotta tell somebody. Landry, you have to tell somebody. (DOOR OPENING) Hey, babe. How'd it go? Hold on. I'm just on the phone. I'm just trying to reach Tyra. She's been MIA. Can't wait to hear how it went. Sweetie, I'm just leaving a message. (MOANS) It went pretty good. Have you been drinking? You didn't tell them yes yet, did you? This is for you. All right, here's how it went down. First of all, I was hotboxed from the get-go. It was either accept the job or lose the job. I didn't want them to think I didn't want the job, obviously. Right. You know. So I say, you know... You didn't tell them... "You know, I got to think about this. "Yes, I accept the job." So this stadium is just like... It's unbelievable. And then I went around Austin. They put me in a car. They had me drive around. It was... It was pretty... It was pretty incredible. And then... (KNOCK ON DOOR) Yep. Taylor : Hey. (GRUNTS) I took the job in Austin. You wanna talk about it? Oh. It's Julie, honey. Matt : I'll get it. Just... Okay. Well, ask her to come in. Hey, you wanna come inside? Okay. What's going on? What? Tell me. I'm moving. (STAMMERING) What do you mean? My dad took this job at TMU. Eric : Yeah? Morning, Coach Taylor. Come on. Get in here, man. You're 15 minutes late. I was? You told me... Yeah, 15 minutes ago. No, I said 15 minutes ago. Don't talk back to me. No, sir. Hey! Saracen. Get your lazy ass in here. Let's go. Come on. Hurry up. I don't have much time. Oh, hey, Street. Saracen. What's going on? Sunday. Big championship game. How you feeling? Good. I'm feeling good. Yeah, you think you're ready? Yeah. You think he's ready? I don't think he's ready. I'm not thinking you're ready, either. I think that if he plays up in Dallas like he played last Friday night, they're gonna eat him for breakfast. That's pretty much what I'm thinking. I think they're gonna squash him. Pretty much like a bug. Like a flea, Saracen. So I don't want you resting on your laurels, you understand me? You don't have any laurels, Saracen. Not a damn laurel. Here's what's gonna happen. You're gonna be working with Jason here. Okay. You're gonna do everything Jason tells you to and you're gonna do it because Jason has my blessing. So if he tells you to jump off a cliff, I want you to jump off that cliff. Now you tell me. Saracen, why are you gonna jump off that cliff? 'Cause... 'Cause he has your blessing? That's exactly right. You have any problems, you let me know. Thank you, Coach. Thank you, sir. Have a good day, son. All right, Coach. What are you still standing here for, Saracen? Go finish your weights, finish your program. Get your plays. Meet me in the film room for lunch. And get used to that, because we're gonna be having an awful lot of meals together. Well, actually, I usually have lunch with Julie... I'll take care of Julie for you. Don't worry about it. I'll give her a nice call, tell her there's a new girl in town and that girl is me. Thank you, Saracen. Hit the weights. Okay. Great. It's just that this friend made me promise not to tell anyone, so I... Well, that's common, I think. Sometimes when people experience trauma, they'll sometimes want to hide, you know, for fear of reprisal or judgment. Sometimes that happens. Is there some kind of law that if I do tell you the student's name that was assaulted that you've gotta report it? Isn't that some kind of law? I don't want you to be offended by this, but... If it turns out that your friend is actually you, I want you to feel comfortable, and you've been hurt... I want you... I want you to know you can absolutely... No. I'm not talking about me. ...talk to me completely safely about this. I'm not talking about me, okay? You can tell me. I'm talking about Tyra Collette. Oh. (KNOCK ON DOOR) Hey, Tyra. Look, it's not that big of a deal. Yeah, it is, sweetheart. Policeman : Let me ask you one more time. Do you remember leaving your notebook behind? No. But when he came outside he had a notebook that looked like your notebook? Look, I already told you, I don't remember leaving my notebook. Are we done here? Can I go now? I believe that about covers it. We just have to get a few pictures. All right. Let's go do that quickly. Woman : Now turn your head to the left. Look, Tyra, I'm sorry. I... No, you know what? I never should've trusted you. Look, Tyra, I'm... You know what you are? You are just a pathetic, smelly geek. And I never want you to talk to me again. So, yeah, I guess just... Just give me a call when you get a chance. All right. So now Tyra isn't even returning my phone calls. Guess I'm just not cool enough anymore. You never know what's going on with somebody, sweetie. Can't take it personally. The whole move, it's just like a bad dream on repeat. I know. (DOOR OPENS) Hey, babe. Hey. Hey. Come on. Let's go celebrate. I'm taking you out to dinner. Taking you out to dinner. Anywhere you want to go. Julie, you get to choose. Wherever it is that you'd like to go. I know what's gonna happen next. The door's gonna slam. (DOOR SLAMS) Why is that? What's going on? Hi. Come sit down. Hi. What? I don't know. That's why I'm... I don't know. You tell me. What is it? I've been thinking about something today. And I'm gonna make a proposal to you, and I don't want you to jump to any kind of immediate decision about it. Okay. All right. Okay. I've been thinking that Julie and I could maybe stay here until she graduates from high school. That would give her some closure here. That would allow me to continue my work here with the kids. Dillon and Austin aren't that far away from each other. I mean, it's not a long commute. You could go on. Take the job in Austin. It's not ideal, but it's a way that we could continue our lives. Keep this family together. No. Just no? Yes. No. There's no way. You just can't say just no just like that. No. And I'll tell you why it's not gonna happen. 'Cause that commute between Dillon and Austin is not just a simple commute. That's a separation between this family. No way. Well, you know what? I need you to just think about it for a second. I'm thinking about it. I'm listening. I thought about it. Well, I think we need to start to consider this now from the perspective of three people in this family. And you and I have a solid relationship. We have a mature relationship. We are mature people and I know that our relationship can handle it. Well, you know what? No, in that sense, I'm not mature. I'm not mature. I can't handle that, because that's not a relationship. That's not a family. That's not what this family's gonna do. And as far as those three people, you're leaving one person out and that would be me 'cause I don't agree with this at all. I do not agree with any bit of what you've said. Well, honey, you know what I'm thinking about right now? I'm thinking about how bad I'm gonna feel leaving these kids here. Why is this happening? Honey. I need you to hear me here. I hear you. I hear what you say. What I'm doing here is important. I did this thing with Tyra today... I understand what you're saying. These kids need me... And what I'm saying is... ...and that's something that I need and I've created this. ...there are other kids that need your help as well. No, there are not other jobs. What I'm saying is... There is this job. ...I took the job and we are moving to Austin. Period. For me. I need to be here. These kids need me here. I would feel bad to leave. Can't you understand that? (DOOR SLAMS) 
 
 You're gonna be so great in Dallas. Look, I'm gonna do what I do, that's all I can do. Well, you know, me, my aunt and my cousins are driving up to root you on? Oh, for real? Yeah. Oh, well, I'm gonna have to keep that in mind, then. Yeah, you might want to do that. Hey. Hey, Wave... Can I holler at you for a second? Oh, yeah. I'll catch up with y'all later. We just talking. That's all. Listen... I've been thinking about this a lot and I'm gonna give you a hiatus. A what? A hiatus. For two weeks while you're at State. I want you to just have the time of your life, you know? Look, look, I don't need no hiatus. Look, I just... I don't want to be the one held responsible for taking away your joy. So, look, you're saying for two weeks I can do whatever I want? Well, I wouldn't go crazy or anything. Like, try not to break the law, you know? But, yeah. Enjoy yourself. (EXCLAIMS) But you... We gonna be partying. I know. Okay? We gonna be going to State! And you're just gonna be sitting at home taking your meds and going to bed early. I mean, what if I'm hanging out with another girl at the roast or one of the parties? I don't know. It's all right. That's all right? That's all right. You know? Just enjoy yourself. Be the Smash. Okay. Okay. Okay. I can do that. I know you can do that. I can do that already. (DOG BARKING) Good morning. Hey. All right. This is what I'm thinking. Listen. Okay, I've been thinking, too. Listen for one second. No, I'm... Dinner tonight. Tacos. No. Not dinner tonight. No, that's fine. That's fine. But I'll try... No, not dinner at all. What do you mean? It's over. We're not doing this anymore here, all right? Why? Because maybe Bo will get hurt. He just... He thinks you're like a father figure, you know? He's had a really tough time with his daddy and I don't... I didn't think I was hurting him. Well, you're not now, but... I mean, you know... I just... I can't do it to him. I can't risk it. I love him. He's my... I'm sorry. We need to talk to you guys. All right? Your father and I are getting a divorce. We love you. We love you all. We do not want you to be hurt over this. We love you. This doesn't have anything to do with y'all. And it's gonna be just the same. Except Daddy's not gonna be living here. Y'all are gonna live here. I'll see y'all on weekends. You're gonna see them every other weekend. Every other weekend. And then, holidays? No, no... I can't. I'm gonna get some air. Lyla, baby... Lyla, just listen. Lyla. Honey, I need you to come back. Nope. I'm done. We need to talk about this as a family, sweetie. Lyla, please honey? He can leave and then I'll come back. How about that? So sorry I'm late. No, I... Don't worry about it. It's Herc's fault. Right. Sure. Yeah. How you doing? I'm good. How you doing? Good. You look nice. Yeah? Yeah. Very nice. Thanks. You wanna go eat? Yeah. Okay. Let's go. Suzy : Oh, man. That was really fun. It was. Besides the fact that our waiter was an idiot. (LAUGHING) I know. I don't think we helped. I think we might have confused him further. You're fun. A little bit. A lot with you. I... I like you. Um... I'm starting to feel really embarrassed. No. I... I like you, too. Really? I really do. I... Oh, my God. Jason. Lyla, I... Look, can we talk? Can you go inside just for a minute? Please? 'Cause it's not what you think. No, you know what? I'm done. Screw you! Hey, Tim Riggins. How you doing, little man? Good. You wanna hang? We could play football and do anything. Hey, did your mom talk to you at all lately? Yeah, she said that you would be busy with football and school. That you wouldn't have time to hang around anymore. I think she's kind of right, Bo. But I figured since we're obviously buds, you could make time for me. 'Cause we're like brothers. I agree. But like your mom said, I got a lot going on, okay? Okay. But I'll come by later? Sure. Yeah. Hey. Yeah? Who pushes you around? Nobody! There we go. Nobody pushes Bo Miller around. Let me guess. The old lady you were getting with dumped you? Is that what's going on? Interesting. How do you know? Small town, Tim. Right. Forgot. And no, the ex-girlfriend Tyra's not available to screw your pain away. That's not why I'm here. Really? Really. I'm here just to see if you just wanna hang out. As friends. I kind of... I could use one right now. Do you even know what a friend is, Tim? You know, a friend is someone who's there for you. Who helps you do what's best for yourself. Who asks you to go out and do things. That's a friend. Come to the Panther roast with me. That's not what I meant, Tim. I know it's not what you meant. Look, I'm tired of overthinking every single thing, you know? Let's just hang out and laugh and have fun. You and me. As friends. Please? (PEOPLE CHATTERING) (SOUL MUSIC PLAYING ON STEREO) You got that flask up there. And Matty used to be so shy he had to e-mail all his plays. Buddy : Hey, everybody! Hey! We're going to State, people! (ALL CHEERING) All right. Everyone take your seat. Take your seat. Time to start the annual roast banquet. Everybody hurry up and sit down. Let's get this roast going. I'd like to bring up for our first speaker, first-time coach of the Dillon Panthers, took us all the way to State this year, Coach Eric Taylor, baby! (ALL CHEERING) Let's start tonight with Smash. (ALL EXCLAIM) Now what is there to say about Smash? There's nothing to say about him, I don't think, that he hasn't already said about himself! Got me on that. No, you got me on that, Coach. You got me on that. You guys have given little Matt Saracen a hard time all year. He's done a great job. But I'll tell you, when he first started as quarterback, he was so shy he had to e-mail his plays in. (ALL LAUGHING) Come on, Matt! Now, for as long as I've known Tim Riggins, there's only two phrases that can put a smile on his face. Number one, "We going to State." And number two, "The results are in. You are not the father. " [i]Hey, I'm just playing with you, baby! I'm just playing with you, baby! (ALL LAUGHING) Hey, how about Saracen sleeping with the coach's daughter? (MICROPHONE FEEDING BACK) (SILENCE) Nothing quite like athletes doing comedy. Tami : I think it's tradition. Yeah, but so was tar and feathering. You can't stay in Dillon. That's absurd. Thank you for calling me absurd. ... but Buddy Garrity will tell you that it is much more serious... I'm not calling you absurd. I'm calling the whole thing absurd. Well, I don't happen to think it's absurd, obviously. I'm not trying to argue with you. I'm just trying... Will you guys talk about this at home, please? Tami Taylor! (ALL CHEERING) Well... This is a roast, not a skewering. Oh, I'm aware of that, sweetie. Lucky for you. Hi, y'all. I'm here to talk to you a little bit about Coach Eric Taylor. (ALL CLAPPING) And... You all know him as your leader, you know, kind of father figure. Hard-ass guy screaming at you from the sidelines. But there's a whole other kind of Eric Taylor that I know that maybe y'all don't. And I'd just like to share that with you a little bit. So, let me start with what I've learned from him as a human being. I mean, what he has brought to me as a person. "The power eye." "The nickel defense." (ALL LAUGHING) "The three-four." "The four-three." And of course, "The spread formation." The ways I have grown since I have been with this man could fill a stadium. And then there's Eric Taylor, the family man. We have wonderful Sunday mornings together (ALL LAUGHING) Watching game film. Saturday afternoons with our daughter watching game film. Oh, and then "Taylor Tuesday" where we'll have a pizza delivered and play Scrabble and then watch some game film. (ALL LAUGHING) And I wanna tell y'all I know he is a busy, busy man and y'all keep him very busy, but he is also a sensitive and caring husband. And he will take me out for quiet, romantic evenings, just the two of us. And we'll commonly be heard shouting things like, "Pick up the blitz!" Or "Hit and drive!" And my favorite, "Go for two!" (ALL CLAPPING) (ALL CHEERING) Seriously. Eric Taylor is a kind and decent man. And he's strong. And he has vision. And he's passionate. And he's real good at imparting that passion into the hearts of the people around him. And he loves y'all kids. Every single one of y'all. I just want to tell you how much you all have touched us. How important you all are to us. How deeply we care about you. So thank y'all, from our whole family. Thank you. (ALL APPLAUDING) (ALL CHEERING) You got a good one, Coach. A really good one. (PEOPLE CHATTERING) Hey, Smash. So we're getting ready to hit a party. You wanna come? Actually, I'm gonna pass. I gotta rest up for the big game. Yeah. Thanks. Maybe some other time. Yeah, maybe. Maybe. Hey, Landry. Tyra. Listen... About the other day. What happened... What other day? Okay, cut me a break here. I'm not very good at this. I'm sorry about what I said. It's not that big of a deal, I mean... I mean, I don't think you're a geek. No, just the pathetic and the "I don't have any friends." Okay, I don't think those things, either. I was just pissed because... Did you think that I really wanted to tell someone? Tyra? Well, I know why you did. I was just feeling burned about everything that happened. And I took it out on you. I'm trying to be better. At a lot of things. I guess that explains why you're getting back with Riggins then. What? I'm not back together with Riggins. See, you say that... No, I'm just here as his friend. Right, right. You say that now, but then, you know, what about the after-party when all the beer starts flowing and you know, Riggins comes in with his cute but tragic "Texas Forever" routine? What about then? Okay. Tim and I are just friends, Landry. Hey, you know what? I know this whole thing is none of my business because you're a big girl and you can do whatever you want. But do you really want to spend the rest of your life with someone that cheats on you and drinks all the time? Who's just gonna end up working at a gas station and, you know, puking all of his paycheck up? Is that what you want? You know, he's gonna cheat on you some more and then you're gonna have a few of his not-so-biologically-gifted kids... Are you trying to make me take back my apology right now? 'Cause it's working. I know. Well, I'm sorry. But for some reason I really just think there's a guy out there that'll show up sober. That'll listen to you whenever you talk and that... That'll actually, you know, respect your opinions and actually take care of you. And actually recognize you for the smart and beautiful and caring woman that you are, Tyra. A guy... A guy that... Tim : There she is. What's going on, Lando? How are you? Gonna come out for a few or what? You know, I can't. You know. Why not? I just can't. (RINGING BELL) Hey. Hey. Well, how was the roast? Buddy Garrity stole my e-mail joke. Are you serious? Yeah, I'm looking into who gave it to him. Well, it wasn't me. I brought you a piece of cake. I missed you. I'm sorry to bother you. I just... I just thought we should talk about some things and clear some things up. You made everything completely clear last night when I saw you with Suzy. I know you're upset but I really need you to... I'm not upset. I finally know the truth about us. You didn't have the guts to tell me, but now I know. And now we can both move on. Please don't come back. We done fighting? Mmm-hmm. I love you. I love you. I respect you. I am proud of you. And I am in love with you completely. I'm sorry for the way all of this happened. I'll tell you what, though. Austin is gonna be good to this family. I know it is. But, baby, I'm not going to Austin. I can't leave here now. Come to bed with me.
