 What do you want to talk about, Tim? 
 The fact that you're sleeping with your paralyzed best friend's girlfriend? 
 Tatum, get over here! 
 If we gonna win, we gonna play my way. 
 Commentator : Oh, and it's picked up. 
 Get out of my sight, son! You are done! 
 Voodoo : I don't care! 
 Taylor : You are done here! 
 Some questions have arisen about Ray Tatum's eligibility. 
 If he is deemed ineligible, Ray Tatum won't be playing football here anymore, and Dillon will be stripped of last night's victory. 
 Karen Stark : I'm here tonight at the Texas High School Athletic Administration District meeting. 
 If it is found that district regulations were violated, Ray Tatum will no longer be allowed to participate in any varsity athletics. 
 More importantly, last week's Dillon Panther win over the Arnett Mead Tigers would be ruled a loss. Can we change the channel? Anchor : Thanks, Karen. We're all anxious to see how this turns out for the Panthers and Coach... I don't get what the big deal is. Kaster, he's just asking you to turn your volume down. It's not just me playing loud. We're all doing it. No, actually, she did single out the bass player. Hey, Saracen. Hey, get over here, man. I'll be right back. Landry : I'll count the seconds. Hey, I want you to meet some people here. This is Tiff. Look, I'm telling you, Tiff, this man right here is golden. You better get him now before somebody beats you to it. (ALL LAUGHING) Matt : Yeah, that's right, he's... That's a joke. Smash : Like you know? He's totally crossed over, man. Would you calm down, please? Oh, man, look at them. Like the entire world revolves around them. Don't they know they're gonna end up menial laborers one day anyway? Virgin territory. Matt : Smash knows. You know, that's... What? I'm trying to help you out, man. This is... Look, what you doing here, Voodoo? Just getting a burger and fries, man. You got a problem with that? Yeah, I got a problem with that. We all got a problem with that. Why don't you find another restaurant, man? I said you should take your wetback ass right across the river. (ALL CLAMORING) Smash : Don't worry about it. Smash : He just wants to spill. Don't even listen. Smash : Just chill. Everybody walk. Chill out. Last thing you need right now is to mix it up with us, man. Trust me. Food sucks here anyway. Move. Smash : Take your bodyguards with you. My man, Rig, making peace. I'm Karen Stark back with a live Channel Eight action update... Player : Look at the news, look at the news! ... where board member Lance Jennings is about to announce the board's decision about Dillon quarterback Ray "Voodoo" Tatum's eligibility. Jennings : I would like to thank everyone for their patience in this matter, but I feel we need more time for deliberations. Therefore, we will not be issuing a final ruling until sometime later in the week. (ALL EXCLAIMING) Hey, we're heading out. You need a ride? Yeah, just give me one minute, okay? Oh, get over yourself, man. It's just a stupid football game. In the large scheme of things, do you think anyone's gonna give a crap? Landry : Kaster, please, just go wait outside. Am I right about that? Just go wait outside, all right? It's fine. Matt : Hey, it's just my neighbor... Is this your buddy? Is he being serious right now? Matt : He's joking. He's making jokes. I mean, I like Kaster okay and everything, but seriously, he's gotta learn that he can't just talk to people like that. Landry : I know. I said that I'll talk to him. That was a dumb-ass thing to say, man. Look, I'm sorry, man. Sorry? Look, man, I'm sorry, all right? You don't look sorry. What's your problem, man? Come on. Dumb football players, huh? Man, chill. Come on. You know that's not what I meant. Is that what you feel? Do you mean that? (GROANS) Knock it off, man! (GRUNTING) Hey, Kaster! Wait! Wait! Get off him! Kaster! Reyes! Man, what the hell you doing? What the hell, man? (KASTER GROANING) Kaster! Easy! Smash : Just stay there! No, just stay there! Just stay right there! Oh, my God. Breathe, man. (KASTER GASPING) Blue 52, hut! Cheerleaders : Hey, Panthers! Coach : Play it. Bring it back. Hustle up! Hustle up! Go! Coach, the board didn't come to a decision. Matt : Black nine! So why am I not getting snaps? Black nine! All right, now. Hey, Coach, let's get them together, one minute. Take a break. Coach : One minute, bring it back to thirty. Let's go! Hey, Reyes. Reyes. What happened? What are you talking about? Well, last night, with Kaster. I know that kid. He dissed us. You heard him. What you talking about, that stupid thing that he said? It's done, man. Get over it. Taylor : Let's go, gentlemen! Let's go! Let's go! Coach! Sorry to interrupt your practice, Coach. We need Bobby Reyes. Got a warrant on him. What do you need Bobby for? Assault. Coach : Get him. Taylor : Reyes! Yeah, Coach? Taylor : Ron, you don't need to use handcuffs. Hell, come on. Where's he gonna go? Cop : Sorry about your practice. Let's go, come on. Coach : Come on, concentrate on the field. Let that go. Come on! This is your job, right here. Get under it, Sanford. Matt : Let's run this. Player : You'll be all right, Reyes! Tyra, you're flunking algebra. Miss Kincaid hates me. She does not. Come on. Yes, she does. Well, if you fail it with Miss Kincaid, you're going to have to go do it next semester with Mr. Wendell. Well, I'm not gonna be here next semester. Where you gonna go? California. What are you gonna do in California without a high school education? I'm taking my GED. Listen, I know, I was just like you. And I was the pretty girl in school. I was terrible at math. I got myself through it. I don't want to be you, Mrs. Taylor. I don't want to stay here, stuck in a small town, in a job like this, married to a coach. Tyra, it's your choice. If you want to go off and take the GED, fine, but you better bring me proof that you did it. Otherwise, you're taking algebra with Mr. Wendell next semester. Fine. (GROANING) Mrs. Kaster : Mrs. Taylor? Yes, ma'am? I'm Kurt Kaster's mother. Oh, come on in. Come on in. I'm so sorry to hear about what happened to your son. Have a seat. I was told to see you about getting his homework sent over to him at the hospital. Yes, we've already arranged that his daily assignments are going to be taken over there every afternoon, and then everything else that we need to do academically will be taken care of. I appreciate that. Absolutely, and just, if there's anything else that I can do... I raised my boy right, Mrs. Taylor. He's a good boy. Yes, he is. He doesn't get into fights. A few days from now that Reyes boy is gonna be back on the football team like nothing ever happened. But I don't need to tell you this, do I? You're the coach's wife. You know how all this works. Well, no, I don't, actually... Thank you for helping about the homework. You telling me the truth straight up? Smash : That's it, it's just talk. Y'all are telling me everything you saw? That's it. You have any idea how difficult it is with these recruitment accusations flying around right now? Now I gotta deal with Reyes and this Kaster kid situation. It's just as much your fault as it is his. From now on, when you're out, you hear something, you see something, you're gonna stop it. As leaders of this team, that is gonna be your job. We clear? Yes, sir. Good, that's all I got to say. You ever get an answer back on the request we put in for extra time in the weight room? Not yet. Jason's making world-class progress. I'll make sure I get you an answer on that. Thanks. What's so funny? You know what they call you around here? What? Advocado. I don't get it. It's like advocate and avocado. I don't find that very amusing. (LAUGHING) It is funny. Come on, think about it. Are they pumping you with nitrous or something? What is going on with you? I don't know. Come here. Come here. Damn, what are you doing? Jason, we can't do this. Yeah, we can. We're in a public place. I knew it. I knew it. What? We have a visitor. Oh, my God. Lyla, I gotta tell you, I am horny as hell right now, totally. Jason! What? I have never heard you talk like this in my life. This is naughty. Naughty. (GIGGLING) You are one of a kind, you know that? Francine : Hey, Lyla. Jason : Hi, Francine. Is it possible that we could have about 40 minutes of privacy? No, Jason, we don't need that. Can I talk to him for a second, Lyla? Yeah, sure. I'll just be outside. Okay. Now, you want to make sure you don't get any dirt up in this carburetor. Mess your engine up something fierce. Looks like we got company. What's up? Tim, we have to stop this. Look at me, Tim. Please. Jason is getting out of there soon. He's changing. He's getting back to his old self. So, you're done with me? Tim, don't. Don't what? Don't react like that. You knew this had to end. Look, I take full responsibility for everything that's happened. It's all my fault. Sounds like it was the biggest mistake of your life, huh? I feel like I have to make a choice, here, Tim, before things get more messed up than they already are. I care about you, Tim. I do. I just... I can't live with myself anymore. Bye, Lyla. So, you're telling me I can't have s*x? No, I said it isn't medically safe to ejaculate. You see, that's funny, cause I always kind of put the two together. Jason, look, semen can backflow into your bladder, and it can cause a whole bunch of things, especially a severe urinary tract infection. You know, I like you a lot, Francine, but you really know how to break a guy's heart. I'll check on you later, okay? Mrs. Kaster came and talked to me today. Uh-oh, yeah. How's the boy doing? Well, he's not doing very well. You know, Reyes really did a number on him. I know, listen, he's a good kid. He just gets a little hot under the collar. A little hot under the collar? I mean, he put him in the hospital, bad. I understand that. I guess I'm just a little curious about what you think. You know, what you're gonna do about that whole situation. What do you mean, what am I gonna do about it? Well, I mean, I think you're in a position where you might be able to... Wait, wait. Let me ask you a question. Who am I talking to right now? Am I talking to the guidance counselor or am I talking to my wife? Oh, come on, what... I'm serious. What do you mean, am I speaking... I don't know, sometimes... ...as the guidance counselor or your wife? I don't know. It doesn't make a difference how I speak to you. Sometimes it does if there's something I need to do or get involved in the situation. I'm just curious about how you're looking at this serious situation. Hi, honey. How are you today? Hey, guys. You all good? Good. You have a good day at school? Yeah, a blast. Here, I got you something I got you something. Got you an apple. Oh, gee whiz. Apple of your daddy's eye. (MUSIC PLAYING ON STEREO) Yeah? Hey, it's me. Hi. Thanks. Come on in. I just, you know, wanted to stop by to let you know that Bart Oliver asked me out. Bart. Mmm-hmm. He's a defensive end. Yeah, I know who he is. Well, you know, I just wanted to give you a heads-up before anyone else ends up in the hospital like that Kaster kid. Don't flatter yourself, Tyra. You know, I'm trying to be the mature one here, douche bag. That's classy. (CELL PHONE RINGING) Have a good day. You're such a jerk, Tim. You know that? Hello? I need you to come down here, Timmy. Jay? There's something I gotta talk to you about. Where? Rehab center? Where do you think? Come on, just get down here, all right? Yeah, man. Well, I'm glad you called me in on this, Eric. It's the right thing to do. I'll make sure this kid gets a fair shake. He's a good kid. I mean, the last thing this team needs is having our star defensive player sitting over here in the jail. Oh, and another thing, we may have to go back in again in front of the athletic administration. What? Well, evidently, when they interviewed Voodoo's family, somebody mentioned the academic counsel we had with Voodoo. That's what you call that, academic counsel? Yeah, the meeting we had. Damn, Buddy. What? When did all this take place? Well, look, he has to have 30 days of established residence before he even puts a uniform on, so the main thing... Damn, Buddy. The meeting took place in July. The meeting took place two weeks ago. Hey, don't worry about it, okay? Oh, don't worry about... Every single team in the district did exactly the same thing that we did. Don't ask me to lie. I'm not gonna ask you to lie. Let's just solve this crisis right now, okay? One crisis at a time. Let's take care of Reyes, and then we'll do the other deal later. Reyes : Made a mistake, Coach. I don't know what to do. I'm scared. Yeah, well it sounds like you made a mistake. Why don't you tell me exactly what happened? We were at the sandwich shop. Just there, you know, hanging out. We were watching the hearing on TV, and I guess I was a little pissed. Then Voodoo comes in, comes right in, like nothing even happened. All right, that's all great. How'd the Kaster kid get involved? When that guy came on TV and said that they weren't coming up with a decision, you know, we all got upset. Then that Kaster kid comes in and he starts mouthing off about football players, and talking smack about the team. You know that no matter what anyone says to you, that doesn't give you the right to cause physical harm to them, don't you? You understand that? Yeah, Coach, I... Then why would you be so stupid, son? Then... The Kaster kid called me a wetback. Well, that's not right. I mean, that's just racist, is what that is. He said I should go back to Mexico. I'm not even from Mexico, Coach. Anyway, I went outside afterwards and asked him to apologize for what he said. He didn't want to apologize, so he goes up and he tries to hit me. So we started fighting, Coach. He was trying to fight me. I fought back. He just set me off so bad. I've been trying to control my temper. You know I have, Coach. You're telling me the truth? Yes, sir. You look me right in the eye. You tell me you're telling me the truth. Coach, I'm telling you the truth. Six. Took you long enough to get here, man. My truck ain't running. We're putting in this four-barreled carb. I hitched a ride, man. I'm sorry. Hell, I'm guessing you know what this is about. I do? Yeah, of course you do. You want to call yourself my best friend, and you haven't shown up but once since I've been in here. Six weeks, man. Six weeks. Let me go ahead and recap my life for you over the last couple weeks, huh? My day starts out with me laying down in this bed... Well, pretty much the whole day takes place with me laying down on this bed on my sorry quadriplegic ass. Every day people come here and poke and prod me like I'm a piece of meat, go ahead and stick a catheter in me in places you don't even want to know about. My big adventure of the day is going to the commode, 'cause I gotta go at the same time every day so I can teach my body how to crap on cue. Impressive, huh? (CHUCKLING) And then Lyla comes running in. I want to know if she's as chipper out there as she is in here. 'Cause I'll tell you what, I love that girl, I do, I love her more than life itself, but I tell you what, if she tells me how great everything's gonna be when I finally get out of here one more time, I'm gonna lose it. The point is this, Timmy. While I'm in here dealing with all this by myself and my best friend's out there putting a four-barreled carb in his damn truck... Is that what's important right now? Answer me this, Timmy. What happened to "Texas forever"? Huh? What happened to living large? What happened to that eternal bond that you used to love to throw around when I was still healthy and headed towards the NFL, huh? I need you here, Tim! I need you here. I expect. I expect you here. You are my best friend. Grace period's over. Reyes : It's embarrassing for me to admit, but before things got physical, Kurt Kaster called me and my family racist names. Said I was a dirty wetback jock who should go back over the border with my dirty wetback mom. I realize that what I did was wrong, and that I should have responded in a more mature way. I've been released on bail,  but the Kaster family is still pressing charges against me. I just wanted everyone to hear the truth, you know, directly from me. Thank you. I'm not buying his story. I'm not buying that. What do you mean, you aren't buying it? Kurt Kaster is a straight-A student. He's on the student mentoring program, and I talked to his mother. I just... I don't feel that he would've said those things. Look, people, they say stupid things. They're teenagers. She just knew in her heart that he didn't do it. I believed her. Look, I've known Reyes for a long time. I've coached him for a long time. He's not a kid... Did you know he's got a record? ...who's gonna go and do something like that. Did you know that he's been arrested twice? Two burglaries, and one of them he resisted arrest? Well, he is a little... He's had a tough upbringing. That's not what we're talking about now. I'm not saying that it was the right thing for him to do to beat the hell out of this kid, but he was obviously provoked. I would like for you to really look at all sides of this thing. Well, of course I've looked at all sides of it, honey. I'm just telling you, I looked that kid right in the eye. He's telling the truth. All right? I can tell. Smash : Hey, who you taking to homecoming? Hey, you should take that little rally girl, Drew. Oh, no, I got someone else in mind. Aw, man, quit stalling. Come on. Hey, I bet your granny still cut an ill two-step. (ALL LAUGHING) Hey, Matt. Hey, can I talk to you for a second? Hey, what's up, girl? What's up? What's going on? Well, Reyes lied. Look, man, we weren't outside, okay? Neither of us were. We don't know that for sure. Well, I mean, we've known Kaster since the seventh grade. I mean, he's not a racist. He's never said one racist thing. Voodoo's the one who said all that stuff. All right, yeah, but it's over, now, okay? It's done. It's not over. I mean, you can do something. What am I supposed to do? Make a statement, call a press conference. You're the starting quarterback, aren't you? Believe me, I'm not Peyton Manning. I can't call a press conference. I've played three high school football games. I haven't even started all of that. Man : Shoulders still feel tight. Christen : If we need to stop at 12, we can. I can do 15. Okay. Jay Street. Christen? Yeah? Could we... Could we get just a couple minutes? Sure. Can you spot him so he can't... Doesn't fall forward? Yes, ma'am. He just got his brace off. You put one hand right there. There you go. This one. Now, you just... There you go. Thank you. Brace off today. 
 
 Nice. Congrats. What say you and me get out of here later? Yeah, great idea. Where do you think we're gonna go? I got some ideas. Tell you what, anywhere but here, man. It smells. It smells like a hospital, and I hate hospitals. All right, genius, when are we doing this? I'm thinking tonight. Let's do it. I'm not lying. Hey, you want to coach big-time high school football? 'Cause that's what every single one of these coaches does. This is part of the deal. You want to coach? You better get ready for this. This is just the way it is, and I don't like it any more than you do. So, get it together, let's go in there and get this done. Man : Let's do it right, and then we'll know. Gentlemen, thank you for coming. Come on in. Forrest freaking Aiken. How are you, man? Good to see you. Good to see you, buddy. How's Pam? She's fine. She's fine. How about yours? Doing well. Keeping me in line. Yes, sir. Have a seat. Have a seat. Yeah. I can't believe it's you. Hey, Coach, this is my old buddy... Forrest Aiken. How you doing? We played football together at UT. Played defense. Coach, how you doing? Just fine. Everything's going just fine. You know, Coach, I hate that you're having to go through all this, and I'm sure you'd rather be spending time with your boys right now. I know you've got a big game this Friday night. There's a big one coming up. That's for sure. Well, I've looked through this, and... Let's cut through all the hoopla. Oh. You know, let's just settle this matter. That sounds good to me. I feel real comfortable with it. I've looked it over and I feel real good about it. I think everything's gonna be just fine. That's good. Woman on P.A. : Attention, please. Assistant Principal Trucks here with a little news update. The ruling just came down from the Athletic Administration. Ray Tatum was deemed eligible to play in last week's game. This means the Panther victory over Arnett Mead still stands. (ALL CHEERING) All the way to it! Team : State! State! State! Just reach behind me and lift. Ready? Yep. (GRUNTING) Why don't you save some of that gel for the other patients, Street? You kidding me? You good? I'm in. I'm in. I'm in. Jason : (PANTING) Swing my legs around. Okay, I gotcha. What is going on? Field trip. Field trip? Yeah. Who did you clear this with? With Street. Can I talk to you for a second? Yes. Go easy on him, boss. Tim, what are you doing? We're going on a little ride. Going on a little ride? Yes. Tim : You ready to rock and roll? Hold on just a second. Lyla, come with us. No, no. You guys go. I'll be behind you with the police brigade. Come here. Come here. Look, let's just for once, let the rules go, all right? I need this. You know I need this. Come on... You guys are crazy. Timmy, let her in. She's coming along. You know how great this is? Me, you, Riggs. Open road. Fresh air. No hospitals. Man, did I need this. Tim : And a straw. Jason : Don't forget the straw! Don't forget the straw. I'm really glad you came, babe. Me, too. I... Running a little low on the cash. What a surprise. I'll be right back. Okay. I don't want this to be awkward. Well, maybe we could start by you not shoving your tongue down his throat, Lyla. I can't take all the blame for this. Oh, and here I thought you were taking responsibility. Oh, shut up, Tim. Lyla, look, it's Jay's night, all right? Let's just get through this for him. Tim : You ready? (GROANING) Now. Oh, God! You ain't in game shape, are you, Streeter? How are you supposed to carry a team? You can't even carry me. Maybe I should just get rid of the chair and have you carry me around everywhere. Tim : Street! Here you go. Two burgers, straight up. Hey, picking up for Taylor? Sure. Thank you. Hey. Hey. So, where's the other one? Ah, trouble in paradise. It's this whole Reyes thing. You mean the guy who nearly killed the other kid, but nobody's gonna do anything about it because he plays football? So I guess that puts you on his side? No, it... I just think you should man up and talk to him. I mean, you two look pretty pathetic without each other. Here you go, honey. You need utensils? No, I'm good. Thanks. All right, look, I thought about what you said, all right? And? And I think, well, you're not really recognizing my position in all this. Look, I'm under a lot of pressure. I'm supposed to lead this team, man. They're depending on me. I can't just make accusations about my teammates. You're Matt Saracen, QB one, right? Look, can you just cut me some slack? You're supposed to be my best friend, okay? Fine, all right? Reyes... Reyes is a crazy son of a bitch, but he's key to our defense. We're relying on him. He also assaulted one of our friends, or do you not have time to think about that with all the pressure and everything? Lover's spat? Look, not now, Reyes. All right? Okay? What's wrong? Where you going? Home. Did I upset you? Hey, just leave him alone. What's wrong with him? Just leave him alone, okay? I mean, do you realize that if you weren't a Panther, you'd be in jail right now? Excuse me? No, he didn't say nothing. You assaulted Kaster, and you just think that you're gonna get away with it, don't you? Hey, you better watch what you're saying, man, seriously. I'm not afraid of you, if that's what you think. What are you talking about? Reyes... You're not worth it. Landry. Landry! What are you doing? Hey, get off me! Matt : Landry! It's over, man! Matt : Why don't you just go home! We don't need this, okay? Stop! Time out, man. Just go home! You know what? Kaster was right about you. You did cross over. You're one of them. Congratulations. Jason : I could be out here all night listening to this. Just nothing. Congratulations on the Voodoo decision. You know it could've gone the other way, don't you? Why, exactly? You go, Buddy Garrity, out to a seedy little motel to meet a kid named Voodoo, along with a manager. And then old Buddy, he starts promising things. What kind of things? He starts promising things. But you didn't do that, sure? I think sometimes that for anyone to do what I do, it is damn near impossible to not sell your soul just a little bit down the river. I think you just keep doing what you're doing, Coach, taking it one day at a time. You know what I really love? Mmm-hmm. I love football. I love football. I know. I love those kids. (DOORBELL RINGING) Hey, Matt! Hi, Julie. How's it going? Not bad. How's dance rehearsals? Dance... It's going really good, you know. We have, like, three practices a week now, and the girls are doing really good, so... That's good. Yeah. Is your dad around? Yeah, yeah. Dad, Saracen's here! What's going on? You all right? Yeah. What's up? Kaster didn't say anything racist. I thought you said you weren't outside. I wasn't. I was inside, but I know Kaster. I've known him a long time, and I don't think he would say anything like that. And besides, that wasn't really the way it was going, anyway. Voodoo's the one who called Reyes a wetback, not Kaster. And I think Reyes was probably just all riled up after that, and then Kaster was just in the wrong place at the wrong time. I know I should have said something sooner. I think I might have been confused between what was right for the team and what... And what was right. Anyway, I'm sorry I bothered you. Good night, Coach. Hey, Matt? Tell your grandmother I said hello. I will. Good night. Hey, I'm Coach Taylor. Yeah, I know who you are. I was wondering if I could talk to Kurt. Please. Hey, there, son. I want to apologize for what happened. When I get back to school, every football player is gonna have a piece of me on a daily basis. Thanks for the apology, Coach. I can guarantee you no football player is gonna come near you. There is no excuse for what Bobby Reyes did to you. Remember when we were just junior high-schoolers, Street? Sneaking down here, dreaming about playing varsity. You know, things have changed, Tim. We're still getting that hunting ranch, Street. Yeah, and how we gonna do that without my NFL money and your whopping one percent? That's just it. I think I'm gonna go pro. You think you can do that? No. Nope. But, I mean, that's just the money part anyways. We can figure that out. Best friends, right? Isn't that always more important than football? No. Not always. It is now. The three of us, we'll rise up together. And get through anything. Anything at all. Taylor : Have a seat. What's up, Coach? I was down there trying to help you, and you looked me right in the eye and you lied. I'm not wrong, am I? Can you even admit the truth? That boy didn't call you any names, did he? No, sir. You went and you beat the hell out of that kid, and then you made up a lie and ditched everything onto him. That's a hell of a position you put me in, isn't it? Come on, Coach. I had to lie, Coach. You know I had to lie. I was scared, Coach. You need to pack up your personals, clear out your locker. You're off the team. You can't do that to me, Coach. Come on, football's all I got. You screwed yourself real good. I believe in you, but I cannot help you here. You are on your own at this point, and I'm gonna tell you what, I suggest you go over to the guidance counselor office and you start working on your anger problems. There is nothing else I can do for you. Go clear it out. Coach : Hold your water, lineman. Hold your water! Here we go! Matt : Blue eighty. Hut! Smash : Come on, man. Come on, let's go. Taylor : Let's go! Let's go! Huddle up! Nice play, big V. Huddle, get in here! Coach! Coach, why you got me playing D? Get back to practice, son. All due respect, I got a state ring sitting in my drawer, and it's not for defense. All due respect, you can go sit on that bench if you like. (PLAYERS CALLING OUT) Coach : Hustle up, guys! (PLAYERS SHOUTING) Player : All right, two, two, two, two! Guess who came in for counseling today? Hmm? Bobby Reyes. Really? Mmm-hmm. Did you maybe have something to do with that? I didn't have anything to do with that. (KNOCKING ON DOOR) Who's that? Eric, it's Buddy. What the hell are you doing? I'm sorry, I know it's late, I had to talk to you. First of all, what's the story on Reyes? What about it? Our star defensive player, he's not there. I realize. You want to talk about this in the morning? Now that's not why I came. I came 'cause Voodoo is gone. He's going back to Louisiana. They re-opened his school. He's gone. He's history. When did you hear that? I just found this out. Before he left, he was interviewed by that reporter woman, that Helen Stark, and he told her that he had lived here two weeks and that he was recruited. And now there's documentation, and so my buddy Forrest Aiken, he can't help us out. Arnett Mead? It's a forfeit. It's a loss. Yeah, the season is over, or it could be over. Night, Eric. Sorry. Y'all, we gotta do this again. We will. When you're officially released. (SIGHING) I sincerely hope that y'all had a good time. We did. Where's your belt? Thank you. Good night. I love you. Bye, baby. Do it again, soon. Phil : You know, Jason, the next time you want to fly over the cuckoo's nest, just let me know. I spent half the night trying to keep the nurses from calling the cops. He can never know what happened between us, Tim. I know. I get it. I'm gonna miss you. Come on, I'll give you a ride to your car.
