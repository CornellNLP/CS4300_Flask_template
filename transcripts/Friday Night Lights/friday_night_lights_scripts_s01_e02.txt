 SUNDAY... 
 SOUTH DILLON CHURCH 
 Pastor : It is a blessing to be in the house of the Lord amongst believers. 
 All : Amen. 
 Pastor : We do know that on Friday night, one of our brothers, brother Jason, was injured in the football game. The doctors are saying that possible he could be paralyzed. But we know of a doctor who's greater than any doctor. 
 All : Yes, yes. 
 DILLON CHURCH 
 Pastor : I have prayed with Mitchell and Joanne Street. And as an entire community, we have come together in prayer and hope. And faith. And with these prayers, this faith, this hope, I believe Jason Street will once again walk in on his own two feet and join this congregation and rejoice with us. 
 EXT. DILLON 
 Billy drives his pick-up and Tim is in back... 
 Billy : I saw that tackle, little brother. I saw him hit that turf. Tell you what I think. He's talking about wanting to play football. He ain't ever gonna walk again. 
 EXT DILLON CHURCH 
 Lyla : And we know he's gonna be fine. He's gonna walk again. 
 Tami (to Jason's mom) : We're prayin' for him. 
 Buddy : Best case scenario, Jason's probably out for a month. You know, it's probably a lot longer than that. But, uh, we need a plan for Friday night. Heck, we... Heck, we need a...need a plan for the rest of the season, is what we need, Eric. So tell me, you think little Matt Saracen can get it done? 
 Eric : I guess we're fixin' to find out. 
 Buddy : Yep. 
 Eric : That was a nice sermon, wasn't it? Hey, Matt. Come here. 
 Matt : How's it goin', Coach? 
 Eric : We got a lotta work to do, son. 
 Matt : Yes sir.

 MONDAY... 
 HOSPITAL 
 Receptionnist : Hey, Lyla. 
 Lyla : Hi. 
 HOSPITAL - Jason's room 
 Lyla : There he is. How you doing? 
 Jason : Better now. 
 Lyla : You ever hear of Nathan Foreman? 
 Jason : Who? 
 Lyla : Scuse me, doc. Can you come help me with this, please? Just grab this side, please. Have you ever heard of Nathan Foreman? 
 Jason : Uh, no. 
 Lyla : I was on the Internet last night reading about this guy. Had a terrible spinal injury, kinda like yours. He now playing varsity basketball for UC San Diego. I'm surprised you never heard of this. 
 Jason : No, I'm...I'm oncology, actually. I'm just... I was just passing. 
 Lyla : Oh, right. Well, can you hold this up for me, please, while I tape this? Thanks. Isn't this amazing? The cheerleaders and rally girls have actually joined forces. 
 Jason : It's real nice. 
 Lyla : Thanks so much. You know, Nathan Foreman missed one season, and the NCAA voted to give him an extra year of eligibility. Look at me, Jason. Look at me. This is gonna be okay. 
 Jason : Yeah. 
 Lyla : Okay? 
 Jason : Okay. 
 Lyla : I love you. 
 Jason : I love you, too. 
 EXT DILLON - Eric's car 
 Radio on air... 
 Sammy : Well, there's no silver lining to this one. This is just a tragic blow to the season,, any way you slice it. Jason Street is the Panthers. The team's been built around him. Now you've got this kid, this 160-pound sophomore? Matt Sorenson? 
 EXT DILLON - Landry's car 
 Radio on air... 
 Landry (to Matt) : They didn't even get your name right. 
 Sammy : I think he just closed his eyes and threw that ball. The kid comes in with three minutes left in the fourth quarter. With that nd of adrenaline rush, anyone can throw one nice pass. Well, Hawk says you better go to church and do a little prayin. 
 PANTHERS' HOME - Cloakrooms 
 Eric : We're still waitin' to hear. They got a specialist's comin' in from Houston. In the meantime, it doesn't make any sense and it does nobody any good to make any predictions one way or the other until we get the official word. Understood? 
 Players : Yes, sir. 
 Eric : As far as football, we got a game Friday. We got a lotta work to do. 
 FOOTBALL PRACTICE - On the field 
 Matt : Ready? Break. Let's go, one! Number two! Two, two, two, two, two. Set! Blue, eight. Blue, eight. Hut! 
 Eric : Hit 'im deep! Hit 'im deep. 
 Mc Gill : Time! 
 Eric : Matt, you gotta throw faster, son. If Dolia's open on the break, you gotta hit him on the break. 
 Matt : Sorry, Coach. I thought... 
 Eric : I don't want you to say sorry. I don't want you thinkin' out here. I want you to throw the ball. Dolia runs deep, hit him deep. He's open on the break, hit him on the break. 
 Mc Gill : You got four seconds or a five-step drop, Matt! All right, come on. Let's do it again. 
 Player : Go, go, go, go, go! 
 Eric : Oh, ho, ho, ho. 
 Mc Gill : God's sakes, Matt! 
 Eric : Come here. What happened? 
 Matt : I...I didn't see the linebacker. 
 Eric : You didn't what? 
 Mc Gill : He's bigger than my front door, Matt! 
 Eric : South Milbank runs a five-three. They're gonna drop the linebackers. We set up in the gun. You got that? 
 Matt : All right, Coach. I gotta...I gotta work on reading the cover... 
 Eric : You need to look at the wide receiver comin' underneath the linebacker. 
 Matt : Yes, sir. 
 Eric : Timing patterns. Hit 'em on the breaks. Hit them on the breaks and play faster. 
 Matt : Yes, sir. Hut! 
 Eric : Saracen. I need you to work a little bit harder. You need to learn this offense, son. You need to know this offense in your mind, in your body. You need to know this offense so well that your children are gonna know this offense in their own DNA. Do you understand me? You understand? 
 Matt : Yes, sir. 
 Eric : All right. Go on. 
 COACH'S HOUSE - Living room 
 Tami : Okay, y'all, I'm outta here. 
 Julie : I'm telling you, you shouldn't go to this book club, Mom. They're just gonna turn you into a pod. 
 Tami : I know. I'm just gonna go one time, show them my literary prowess. And then I'll be done with it. 
 Eric : Hey, come here. Come here. 
 Tami : I love you. 
 Eric : I love you, too, babe. 
 WOMAN'S HOUSE - Girls' night 
 All : To the girls' night. Girls. Cheers. We are thrilled that you're here with our book club. 
 Tami : Thank you. I'm so excited to be here. I love the book. 
 Woman : Oh, no. Oh, that's great. We don't really read the book. 
 Tami : Y'all didn't read the book? 
 Woman : We're just here to have fun. Tell me, how's your husband feeling about the team? Exactly, let's talk about what's important. 
 Tami : He's...he lo... he's, um... excited about the team. 
 Woman : Well, you know, are you sure? 
 Tami : Listen. He should play my Robbie D. more. What he should be doin'... He should be running more dives than counters straight ahead. Do you have any idea what his plans are for Robbie? I don't. Smash-mouth football. Smash-mouth football. Three yards and a cloud of dust. This boy is ready to rumble. 
 TUESDAY... 
 DILLON RESTAURANT 
 Smash : So look, you got my math homework? 
 Rally-girl : yeah. 
 Smash : Where is it? 
 Rally-girl : At my home. 
 Smash : I gotta come to your house and pick it up, huh? Well, you gonna be there? 
 Rally-girl : Of course. Okay, all righty. All righty. 
 Girl : Can't believe it. Just three days ago, we were right here. Jason Street was literally sitting right over there. 
 Tyra : Could they be more annoying? I mean, seriously. Hey. Hey, yeah, you. You don't even know Jason Street. So stop crying. Okay, no. Seriously, stop. So. Just how drunk are you right now? 
 Smash : Look, we can't... we can't just sit around and cry about it. Somebody's gotta take control. You know, like when one person drops the ball, somebody's gotta jump on the fumble. You pointin' at me. That's me, right? 
 Players : That's you, man. 
 Smash : That's me, baby. I know what I gotta do. We can't afford to lose this. This is ours. I wanna get to state. 
 Girl : Hey, Matt. So, I'm yours. 
 Matt : S-sorry? 
 Girl : Well, now that you're first string, you get a first string rally girl. So the way this usually works is you tell me what you like, and I'll provide it. What do you like, Matt? 
 Matt : Uh, I don't... I like, um... 
 Girl : I make a mean chocolate coconut cake. Made with real butter. 
 Matt : Well, that's... that sounds... 
 Girl : Tell you what. Why don't you try it, see what you think, and we'll go from there. 
 Matt : Yeah, that sounds good. 
 Landry : Okay, can we just pause for a second and reflect on thE implications of this? 
 Matt : No, no, no. I can...no. I can't think about girls right now. 'Cause I got a big game on Friday, so... 
 Landry : I mean, this is it. We gotta seize our opportunity. I mean, you're QB1 now. You know, me and you. Me and you? 
 Matt : What do you even have to do with it? Besides, it doesn't seem right with Jason sittin' there in that hospital, just layin' there and all. 
 Landry : Well, maybe it's not right, but it's what we got. You know? Four or five weeks, he's back on the team. You're second string again. You know, the rally girls, they pack up their little tent and they move right down the road. 
 Smash : You think this team needs a leader? 
 Players : Yeah, it does, man. Look no further. I'm gonna lead this team. I know what I gotta do. Y'all gonna be wit' me? I'm gonna take us straight to state. Just because Street went down don't mean we just stop playin'. Look. Everybody get behind the Smash, and we won't miss a beat, baby. 
 Tyra : Tim, no. Sit down. Don't do this. 
 Smash : I'm sayin' we need to hit the weight room tomorrow hard. You gotta step it up. Look, you gotta run your rocks. Hey, wassup, Rig? 
 Tim : Get up. 
 Smash : What? 
 Tim : You're sittin' in Street's booth. Get up. 
 Smash : Look, what you talkin' 'bout, man? 
 Tim : You heard what I said. 
 Smash : Why don't you go home and sleep it off, Rig? Be on time at practice for a change. 
 Tim : You're right. You guys enjoy the rest of your evening, okay? 
 Smash : Hey, smile, Rig. God don't like ugly. Man, what's wrong with you? 
 Girl : No, no. 
 Tyra : What's the matter with you? Go on, Riggins! 
 COACH'S HOUSE - Living room 
 Tami (on phone) : No, I think it's a great case. Well, sure. I'd love to help out. All right i can do thatRice Krispie Treats? No, I th...I... Rice Krisp Treats are great, and I do prefer 'em with the M and Ms in. Yeah. I'll probably just make 'em out of a box. Oh, that many? 
 Eric : It's broken. 
 Tami (on phone) : Okay. I would be happy to do that, sure. All right, and thank you so much again for last night. It was just wonderful. Okay. I'll talk to you later. Bye! 
 Tammy hangs up... 
 Tami : I swear, I've gotta make 200 Rice Krispie Treats by Saturday. Went to that book club meeting last night. I'm on 12 committees now. 
 Julie : Told you. It's a slippery slope. 
 Tami : How's the AC? 
 Eric : It's broken. You were right. Call the guy. I'm sorry. 
 Tami : Sugar? I think it's time for me to get a job. I mean, we talked about it. We're settled. I think it's all right. 
 Eric : You gonna do it now? 
 Tami : Yeah, I think now. I'm gonna put out some feelers, all right? 
 Eric : All right. 
 Tami : All right. 
 Eric : That's great. 
 Tami : Nothin' you need to worry about. 
 DILLON RESTAURANT 
 Mayor Rodell : Now, those boys, those boys have always been weak against the run. And this year is no different. They cannot defend against the ground game. Am I right, Rich? 
 Man : That's exactly right. 
 Mayor Rodell : So it's simple. You give Smash the ball. You let him do his thing. 
 Man : Yeah, and don't let Saracen throw the ball. 
 Mayor Rodell : I know. We don't want any more of our boys beaned in the helmet. 
 Buddy : That was funny. 
 Man : That boy can not do the job. I mean, you can't just... You can't just sit back and close your eyes and expect miracles to happen every time you throw the football. Just ain't gonna happen. 
 Mayor Rodell : That boy will lose us ball games. 
 Buddy : Hey, now. Ease off on all these pearls of football wisdom down there, and let Eric finish his riblets. 
 Mayor Rodell : That's right. He's right. 
 Buddy : Uh-huh, because, I mean, he knows what it takes on Friday night. 
 Eric : That's right. 
 Buddy : A big ol' W. 
 Eric : You know, I just wanna say... I'm gonna keep all this in mind. And thank you very much for this meal. This is a fantastic meal. 
 Mayor Rodell : Oh, it's our pleasure. 
 Eric : Fantastic meal. 
 FOOTBALL PRACTICE 
 Mc Gill : Ball, ball! Aww. Oh, for God's sakes, Matt! Watch the way you throw the ball! Don't you think we oughta start focusing on our ground game? We give this kid too much to think about, he's gonna fall apart in front of our eyes. Big time. 
 Eric : Let's go! Thanks, Coach. I'll run the practice today. I right power 26. 
 Matt : Hut! 
 Mc Gill : Hit somebody! 
 Player : What's going on over there, Coach? 
 Coach : I seen my granddaddy make better blocks playing checkers. 
 Tim : Yeah, if you could run as fast as you talk, we'd probably score every play. 
 Smash : Look, you got some--you got somethin' to say to me? 
 Tim : You need to start gettin' behind my blocks, right behind me. I can't keep doin' all this. And you need to quit... 
 Coach : Hey, what's wrong with you guys? What the hell you doin'? Knock it off. Hey, get outta here! South side of Dillon, baby, for real!

 SMASH HOUSE - Living room 
 Regina : Have you lost your mind? 
 Tyra : You must be Mrs. Williams. 
 Regina : Yes, I am. Messin' with white girls after gettin' in a fight at practice.You're comin' with me. Move. This to get back at Tim Riggins? 
 Tyra : What are you, a shrink?

 Tyra : Hey, I know how to use protection. I'm not some piece of trash.

 Jason : Well, uh... You know, when I was... when I was kinda like that kid? You know? I don't know. He's a lot different. He doesn't need it real bad, like I do, I think. He's kinda creative. You know? Listens to Bob Dylan and draws pictures and...stuff.I don't know. He's a... He's a good kid, I think. You free him up a little bit out there on that field, he'll, uh... he'll make some things happen for you. 
 Eric : You're a good man. You're a good man. You're what makes guys like me wanna coach. You are a good man. 
 Jason : Thank you. I'm sorry if I... sorry if I let you down. Let the team down. 
 Eric : Damn, son. You didn't let me down. You did not let me down. 
 WEDNESDAY... 
 EXT. MATT'S HOUSE 
 Landry : You know, the problem is, is that they keep comparing you to Jason Street. Know what I mean? That's like... That's like comparin' my music to the Red Hot Chili Peppers or something. I mean, I'm not...I'm not the Red Hot Chili Peppers. I mean...I mean, I'm my own thing. 
 Matt : I'm not any better or any worse. 
 Landry : It's just different. No, you're definitelya whole lot worse. Okay, well, that's not the point, all right? The point is, you gotta learn how to work the media. You know, let them know who Matt Saracen is. I mean, right now, the bitches can't even get your name right. 
 Matt : All right, well, who is Matt Saracen? 
 Landry : Who is Matt Saracen? Matt Saracen is QB1. And when the cameras start rollin', just start spewin' stuff out. You know what I mean? I mean... just be out there. The weirder you are, the better, really. 
 
 
 
 FOOTBALL PRACTISE 
 Matt : Not everyone's gonna be the Red Hot Chili Peppers. I mean... Jason Street is a great guy. And everyone knows what he's all about. So he's like...he's like the Red Hot Chili Peppers. Um, but... and everyone likes that, and that's good, but that's not me. 
 Journalist : Well, if Jason Street is the Red Hot Chili Peppers, who are you? 
 Matt : Uh... Exactly. I mean, who am I? Who...who am I? 
 Cheerleaders : Big G, little O. Go, go! Sharp arms! Big G, little O. Go, go! Last time. Big G, little O. Go, go.

 Tim : Yeah, cool. 
 Lyla : You know, Jason's been asking about you. 
 Tim : Yeah. How, uh... how is J.? 
 Lyla : He's good. He's good? He's real good. He's still Jason. 
 Tim : I know. 
 Lyla : I was gonna go over there later, around 8:00. Visiting hours are over at 6:00, but I kinda got the place wired. You wanna come with? You know, you wait too long, he might start takin' it personal, Tim. 
 HOSPITAL - Jason's room 
 Doctor : The MRI shows damage to the cord at the C7-T1 junction. It could be much worse. Jason, you're fortunate that the fracture was low enough that you'll still be able to use your arms and hands. 
 Jason : It's okay. What about my legs, doc? 
 Jason's mom : Well, we'll just keep prayin'. And then once you start physical therapy... 
 Jason : Ma. Look, Dr. Kroll. I just wanna know if I'm gonna be able to walk again. Please. Look, I can take it. All you gotta do is tell me the truth.

 Lyla : What? 
 Jason : We have to talk about this. All right? About me. 
 Lyla : I spoke to Dr. Kroll. He didn't say it was impossible. 
 Jason : Lyla. It would take a miracle for me to walk again. I mean, it's just not gonna happen. 
 Lyla : You know what I think? I don't think Dr. Kroll realizes who you are. We are gonna go out, and we are gonna find the best doctors out there. That's what we're gonna do. 
 Jason : Lyla, doctors don't... 
 Lyla : You are Jason Street. And I am Lyla Garrity. And everything is gonna work out just the way we planned it. Thank you, Lord, for all that You have given to Jason and myself. We don't know yet why You are putting us through this test, but I know that You'll find a way to show us. And we will pull through this test. Whatever it takes. Amen. 
 Jason : Amen. Amen. 
 COACH'S OFFICE 
 Eric : I saw you pullin' up. 
 Tami : Mm-hmm. Thought you might. 
 Eric : What are you doin'?

 Eric : Matt Saracen isn't ready for this. 
 Tami : Mm-hmm. 
 Eric : This... this town. Oh, this town expects, this town expects state. They expect nothin' less, babe. 
 Tami : I know. 
 Eric : I tell you what. Right now, I have no idea whether or not we can even win a game and I'm serious when I say that. 
 Tami : Yeah, well... I know what you're gonna do. I know that you're gonna mold that boy. You are gonna mold Matt Saracen, same way you did with Jason Street. You did it with Jeff Perell back in Macedonia. You took that kid in. I mean, he didn't know the difference between a skinny post and an out-and-up. You made him the best quarterback in the league. You did that. 
 Eric : Yeah, well, I also had close to a year to get him ready. This is a little bit different. I-- 
 Tami : Well? 
 Eric : I got no time here. I got no time. I lose a game, I'm on the road. I lose a couple more, we're packin' our bags. And I tell you what. What they say, it's right. I mean, I... Jason Street, he was my meal ticket. He's the only reason I got this job, and God bless that boy. But I am screwed. 
 Tami : You know what? 
 Eric : I... 
 Tami : There is not a person in the world that could do this, except for you. This is what you do. I've seen you do it with my own eyes. I believe in you. I believe in you with every cell in my being.

 Grandma : Sit down, have some. 
 Eric : I appreciate that. I... I tell you what. I, uh, I... 
 Grandma : Oh, wasn't he wonderful Friday night? 
 Eric : Ma'am, he was. 
 Matt : Thanks, Grandma. 
 Grandma : I'm so proud of him. 
 Eric : You should be proud of him. Uh... I'll tell you what. If it's okay with you, I'd like to take Matt off your hands for about an hour. There's something I'd like to discuss with him as far as the football game this week. 
 Grandma : Oh. Yes, you do have a big game, and yes, you can take him. 
 Eric : Thank you, ma'am. I'll have him back soon. 
 Grandma : But I want you to come back. 
 Eric : I will come back. I'll come back for some more cake. 
 Grandma : All right. You'll better do that. 
 Eric : Next time, I'm gonna have the milk, too. 
 Grandma : I'll get you some milk. 
 Eric : All right. 
 Grandma : And I've got hot chocolate and everything you could want. 
 Matt : All right, you get some rest, Grandma, okay? 
 Grandma : All right. I'll wait for you. 
 Matt : Okay. 
 Grandma : Now, you listen. You listen to him. 
 Matt : I will. I'll be home... 
 Grandma : Move your feet. Move your feet more. 
 Matt : Right. I love you, Grandma. 
 Grandma : Love you. 
 Eric : Will do. 
 Grandma : Coach Taylor. 
 FOOTBALL FIELD 
 Eric : I could never sleep the night before a game. In my head, I'd go over the plays over and over. It'd drive me crazy. I'd read. Bought a book on meditation. That didn't work. Your dad in Iraq, that must be hard. 
 Matt : It's not so bad, sir. 
 Eric : I tell you what. My dad, he was anything but in Iraq. My dad... my dad was on me day in, day out. Still thinks I shoulda made the NFL. But as much as I complain about him, I don't know where I'd be without him. You know, you... I don't know how you do it. I mean, you got your time commitments. You got your pressures. You got your studies. All that, and being the man of the house, too. 
 Matt : Yes, sir. 
 Eric : I'll tell you somethin'. I know you didn't want me to step foot in your house tonight. But I'll tell you somethin' else, and don't you ever forget this: You should feel proud. You should feel real proud. 
 Matt : Yes, sir. 
 Eric : This is all yours for the takin'. Depends on how much you want it. It's yours for the takin'. You know, the other night, you played for a few minutes. Tomorrow, four quarters. You can't be distracted by anything. You're gonna have a lot of distractions. You're gonna have our fans, their fans. You got the band. You got the cheerleaders, with their pretty,young-shaped legs bouncin' up and down. You got a job to do. Nothing else. Your teammates gonna need to hear you! You call the plays! You gonna be able to call the plays? 
 Matt : Yes, sir. 
 Eric : 22 rocket on hit. 
 Matt : 22. 20... 22 rock... 
 Eric : I can't hear you. 
 Matt : 22. 
 Eric : I can't hear you. 
 Matt : 22! 22 rocket... 
 Eric : This should be... You're QB1 of the Dillon Panthers. Your teammates, if they can hear you, they will believe in you. Now, you let it out until it hurts! You understand me? 
 Matt : 22! 22 rocket! Hit, hit, hit! 
 Eric : 44 crossfire on red. 
 Matt : 44! 44 crossfire! Red, red, red! 
 Eric : What's your name? 
 Matt : Matt Saracen! 
 Eric : What you play? 
 Matt : QB1! 
 Eric : And how do you play it? 
 Matt : Perfectly! 
 Eric : We'll see about that. Who do you play for, Saracen? 
 Matt : Dillon Panthers! 
 Eric : How much do you want this? 
 Matt : I want it, Coach. 
 Eric : How much do you want this? 
 Matt : I want it! 
 Eric : Then take it! Do it again! 
 Matt : 44 crossfire! Hit, hit, hit, hit! 
 FRIDAY ... 
 AUTOMOBILE GARRITY'S 
 Buddy : Well, Eric, you know, you and I've known each other a long time. I've known you since, well, I was just a salesman here, and you were the junior high coach over there. And, uh, well, you probably liked me a lot more then, didn't you? 
 Eric : I wouldn't say that. I don't know. 
 Buddy : Well, I like you, Eric. I just want you to always know that. I like you, and I believe in you, and I'm glad you're back here with us. 
 Eric : Good. I appreciate that. 
 Buddy : So. It's Friday night. You feel it? You ready for it? Game night? 
 Eric : Yep, mm....hmm. 
 Buddy : Right? You ready to go? We're gonna give 'em our best, you bet. Well, I don't want to hear that. Now, this is not just some game. You realize that. After what's happened with Jason. I mean, this is about tradition. It's about this town. It's about the spirit, and keepin' this town alive. That's football. That's all we got. Now, if we lose this game, this town's just gonna be in a turmoil. And I don't need that. 
 Eric : Nah, we don't... we don't need that. 
 Buddy : No. This team needs a W. This town needs a W. Hey. Always friends. All right. Good. Go get 'em tonight, Coach. Always friends. Always and ever. Always. 
 FOOTBALL GAME - Cloakroom 
 Eric : All right, listen up. We've suffered a big loss. A big loss. Some of you may be scared. And that's natural. Now, some of you may be really pissed off. One good thing about football is we get to channel that energy. This team has never been about one player. It's about all of us. Every single one of us. And if we're gonna come back from this loss, we're gonna need every one of us. Not one man. Every single one of us. Together. All right, let's pray. 
 Dear Lord, please let us have a successful night tonight. A safe game. Please let us all play to our fullest potential. Please look over Jason Street. Let him know that he's in all of our hearts. We love him. And we miss him. Thine is the kingdom, the power, the glory, forever and ever. Amen. 
 Players : Amen! 
 Eric : Clear eyes, full hearts... 
 Players : ...can't lose! 
 Eric : Let's get 'em! (ALL YELLING) Let's get 'em out there, now! Y'all take care. 
 Players : Coach, good luck. 
 Eric : You up for this? 
 Matt : Yes, sir. 
 Eric : Let me ask you one question. Last Friday night, when you threw that pass, that...that winning pass... did you close your eyes? 
 Matt : No, sir. My eyes were open, sir. My eyes were wide open. 
 Eric : Let's go play football. Come on.
