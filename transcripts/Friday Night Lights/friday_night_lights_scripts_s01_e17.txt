 She's on the phone right now with Matt Saracen. 
 It's becoming that thing that we always knew was gonna happen with our little girl. 
 We've kinda been going out, but we never really made it official. 
 Will you be my girlfriend? 
 I'm here to inform you that you have been invited to training camp in Austin. 
 Quad rugby national team is having tryouts in Austin. 
 And if I go and I make the team, possibly be going to Beijing later this year. 
 Hey, Tyra. 
 Your mom is the greatest. 
 She volunteered to help me finish out tonight. 
 What is your problem? 
 Your dad. 
 Buddy Garrity. 
 His dirty hands all over my mom, his employee. 
 Dad is down in Corpus Christi. 
 He's working on a driving range. 
 Do not believe a word that that man says. And do not get drunk with him. 
 Walt : I'm on the wagon now. Sober, uh... 
 Six weeks next Tuesday. 
 Tim! What are you doing? 
 Dad's here. 
 How about another round, sweetheart? 
 Let's go, uh... 
 Three. Corner. 
 Buck, you is on fire! 
 Ooh. 
 Nice shot. 
 Oh, Lord. That was nice. 
 Yes! Nice shot I don't know what's gotten into him. 
 I really don't. 
 I'd say his game's improved quite a bit in the last half hour, wouldn't you? 
 It's weird, huh? 
 Yeah, I'll say. 
 Thank you, darling. 
 Watch your back, sir. 
 Don't want to hit you. 
 This is for all the money. 
 Oh, baby! 
 The winners? 
 Who's the winners? 
 All the way home! 
 Oh, now you're up against it. 
 Hey, you wouldn't be hustling us here now would you? 
 Hustling you? 
 Yeah. 
 Hustling you, beating you with one hand tied behind my back either way you still owe me a hundred bucks. 
 Who the hell do you think you're talking to? 
 Huh? 
 I'm talking to the guy who owes me a hundred bucks. 
 The loser who owes me a hundred bucks. 
 Oh, really? 
 Uh-huh. 
 And how is it you come in this place and that boy can't hit a shot? 
 Boy, you play just like a... 
 Ow! 
 Did you throw that? 
 Me? No. 
 Hey... 
 Punk! You wanna fight with me? 
 Huh? 
 You wanna fight me? 
 Take me down? 
 Aren't you gonna do anything about this? 
 My boy can handle himself. 
 I'll take you outside. 
 There's to be no fighting in here, Buck! 
 You lost. 
 Now pay up and leave. 
 Hundred bucks. 
 There's your money. 
 You wanna take me on, you come back and find me. 
 Get out! 
 Hablar. 
 Hablar. 
 Hablo, hablas, habla, hablamos, hablan. That works. Hmm? Matt? Matt? Yeah? Did you eat the last of that pudding? What? Now you know I like a little pudding at the end of the day just to settle my stomach. Hi, Julie. Hey. Now hands off my tapioca, Matthew. Yes, ma'am. (DOOR CLOSES) (HORN HONKING) So you wanna maybe try and study again in the... I think we should have s*x. ...morning? Well, I think it's time. Don't you think? Yeah. Me, too. So, um... Let's get on that. Goodnight. Hi, Matt. (STUTTERING) Hi, Miss... Miss Coach. No. I'm telling you, Matt. This is the watershed moment. Here. I mean you're going into an entirely new realm. I got a, um... Look, I've got just a little gift for you. I found this in my dad's glove compartment. No. No! Landry. I found it and I was just thinking. Get that nasty, raggedy-assed thing out of here. Look. Come on. Come on. Excuse me. One second. Now look. You got her at first and inches but you still gotta read the coverage. Okay? Now I ain't trying to encourage s*x out of wedlock. Don't put it on old Smash. Okay. But if you're gonna do it, you're gonna need to think about logistics. You're gonna need a time. You're gonna need a place. And you're gonna need some fresh protection. Yeah, he is right. You got some work to do, son. All right. This is Sixth Street, Austin. Party central. Eyeballs deep in beautiful women, man. I don't care about... Austin women! Being up to your eyeballs in women. I care about getting to practice. It's a big deal. Hey! How you doing, baby? Woo! (HONKING HORN) Hey, darling! Oh, my lord. We're gonna hit that later. We're gonna be late, Herc. We're gonna be late! Will you relax! I told you we were gonna be late. I told you! Mad at you? I am mad at you. You crying? I am very mad at you. And you wanna know why? 'Cause this is a big deal to me. And to you, it seems like you don't wanna... Yeah, yeah, yeah... Shut up. Shut up. Shut up. You don't wanna... I thought we were done. Look. How are you doing? I need to know everything about you right now. Your full name. What's your favorite color? And what you drink? Uh... hi. Jason Street. Coach : Nice job! Let's go! Is this your first time here? Actually, I don't really have time for a conversation. So if you could just sign me in that'd be great. It's not me asking. It's a question on the form. Jason Street. There's your welcome packet and your room key. There is your jersey. Mo : Have fun. Hey. I'm already having fun, Mo. I'm gonna get me some "Mo" later. Mo : I'll be ready for some "Mo." All right. (PLAYERS SHOUTING) Did you really fall for that? Kind of. Where the hell have you guys been? I don't wanna hear any excuses. What are you looking at? Uh... Nothing, sir. Get around! Get in the chair! Yes, sir. What are you guys looking at? Let's go! Let's play some rugby! Let's go! Yeah? Hi. Is Billy in? Billy, some chick's here to see you. Sweetheart. I'll be a second. All right. What's up? I'm actually, uh, here about Tim. Oh... Walt... He's, uh... He's drinking again. Well, that's... Deal or No Deal's  on, Billy. Yeah. Uh... That's right on schedule, so... Yeah. Well, Tim doesn't seem to see anything wrong with it. And it just seemed like he was doing so much better. So I just thought that maybe you would, you know... You, uh... Talk to him. You can't help him. Okay? I've done everything I could for him. He chose Walt in this situation. He's made his bed and now he's gotta lie in it. He's just gonna have to live with the decision. All right? All right. Eric, you're my friend, right? I can talk to you about anything, right? Yeah. Well, I'll just put it point blank. I strayed outside my marriage. I mean... And the problem is now she thinks it's more than it is. Uh-uh. No. No. Yep. I'm saying uh-uh. I don't want to know who it is and I don't want to know anything about it. Yeah, I mean we had a wonderful time. Don't... don't... She's a wildcat. You know what I mean? But it's just... I can't... I mean she... Keep your voice down. I may have said some things in the heat of passion. You know? I may have said I was unhappy in my marriage in some ways but you know how it is. No, Buddy. I don't know how it is. Well, that's not the only problem. She also... She works for me. I know. I know. Hey, Eric. Hey, I'm a weak man. You're a stupid man. No, I'm a sinner. You know? I'm just looking for a little guidance here. Just a little... Just a little advice is all I'm asking for. You want some advice? Yeah, I do. Number one, you should tell this woman, whoever the hell it is and I don't want to know, that under no uncertain terms that it's over. Number two, you need to go home and take care of your wife and think about those kids of yours. That's all I got to say. I'll let you cover the bill. Oh, I got it. I got it. Thanks. (SIGHING) Okay, let's see what we got here. We got, um... Got Endure, Elasticon. We got, uh, True Fit. We... We can cancel out Mega I believe. I think you should think about Elasticon, so... Let's do this. Let's... Let's just get this. Now hold on. Wait. God, I mean this is an important decision here, Matt. You gotta look at everything. Didn't you hear what Smash said? "It's all in the details." None of this is gonna matter if I die of embarrassment first, so let's just get it and go. You are not. You're being a baby. Okay. Something that protects everyone from everything. All right. Yes, those. Let's get those. Let's get those. Okay. Fine. We'll do it. You sure you don't need like a backup or something? Backup? Just in case those don't... There's like 12 of them in here. I know but... (DOOR OPENS) (DOOR SHUTS) Hi. Hey. I saw Matt Saracen buying condoms today. Oh. You know anything about that? No. Really nothing? Uh-uh. Well, he was either buying them for you or he was buying them for somebody else. I think you better come talk to me. Okay. Are you and Matt Saracen having s*x? No. We're thinking about it. You're thinking about it. Are you thinking about pregnancy? Are you thinking about sexually transmitted diseases? Well... I mean, obviously. That's why he's buying condoms. Oh, I see. So you're just buying condoms and then when you buy condoms that just makes you ready to make love to somebody. Anybody. "Making love." Don't do that. Don't you smirk at me right now. I am very upset! You are not allowed to have s*x! You're 15 years old! I just... I don't see what's the big deal. It's just one body part going into another. No, it's not. No, it's not. It's not just one body part going into another body part. And the fact that you think it's not just one body part going into another body part makes me real clear on the fact that you really are not ready for this. And I need you to be able to hear that. I need you to be able to hear me say that to you. I'm listening to you. Let me tell you what the big deal is. Let me tell you what can happen. What can happen is that you can be hurt. And you can be degraded. And you can become hard and you can become cynical. And I don't want that to happen to you. This is something that's special. It's something that's meant from people who are in love. Okay. I... I understand. And you can wait. I want you to be able to talk to me about it. Okay. I mean, we're talking, right? (CHATTERING) Matt. Hey. What's up? What's going on? Hey. So my mom saw you buying condoms last night. Did she... Is she... Is she gonna tell your dad? (STAMMERING) No. She said she wasn't going to. So then we're not gonna do this. We're not gonna have s*x. No. We are gonna do this. And I just don't understand what the whole hysteria is over losing your virginity. Um... well, I got us Bradley's lake house. You told Bradley? So Bradley... Does the entire team know now? (STUTTERING) Well, just Bradley. And Bradley's Bradley, so Bradley won't say... Bradley's good. You don't need... You don't need to worry. He won't say anything. Okay. Okay. All right. So here's the thing, Matty Boy. Hundred and eighty seconds. Anything else is failure. (MUMBLING) Hundred and eighty. I can do 180. I can do that. Hey, look. You gotta use your camera phone. I don't even have a phone. You don't have a... I'll let you use mine. But you gotta have something to remember. All right, seven. Don't let these rookies tell you what's going on. Remember the first time you drove a car? Yeah, I crashed my grandma's car and now Landry drives me around. Good luck to you, seven. Stand on your own time. Let's go! Yeah, baby! Dig! Dig! That's my boy! Hey, Riggs, that's real cute. You got your pop cheering you on. Mr. Riggins, can I help you? Hey, Coach. First team over the ball! Why don't you give him more carries? He's as good as that Smash kid. Tell you what. We're right in the middle of practice right now. If you like, you can stand over there on the sidelines... No, I'm serious. Why don't you give him more carries? That's all. I think maybe we can talk about this at a more appropriate time. I'm in the middle of practice right now. You're more than welcome to stay on the sidelines. Hey, Coach. Coach. Players : Blue! Eighty! Blue! Eighty! Quarterback : Hut! You're really king of this castle, aren't you? Huh? You think you're better than me? Is that it? Player : Okay. Let's run it again. Quarterback : Set! Over on the sidelines will be fine. All right! Let's go! Player : Run it back down! Get 'em, son! Coach? Yeah. Uh, remember that, uh, camera that we got from Boosters? Yeah. It's missing. What do you mean, "It's missing"? Can't find it. It's a $3000 camera. You better find it. Yeah? Jason : It's just, uh... It's great to feel like part of a team again, you know? I've got the least experience but I'm pretty sure I'm a better athlete than two of them. And, uh... So that just leaves this other guy. Hi, honey. Hello. What? You know? I think I could take him. You know? Babe? Love you, too. Lyla? Am I boring you? Are you with me. No, it's just... My dad just walked in and started making out with my mom. What are you doing? She's gonna know you're at a party! Are you at a party? No. No party. No... It's a "partay." It's not a party. It's not a party. It's just, uh... I thought it was gonna be all work stuff. (STAMMERING) Well, it is. It's just a couple of the boys, babe. It's no big deal. Okay? Oh, yeah. Buddy! Aw... (LOUD MUSIC PLAYING) Would you, uh... I spilled a little. Would you get me a paper towel out from underneath that sink? Just right over there. (PEOPLE SHRIEKING) (LAUGHING) What are you doing? Oh! I, uh... Hey. I'm, uh... (LAUGHING AWKWARDLY) Just... I was designated to pick the next CD and we're kind of out of options. Well, what do you got? God... you know I don't even recognize half of these. What was right there? That one you just touched? I don't know. That's a classic. Gotta go with that. Loretta Lynn. Nice. So, uh... Look, I just want to say I'm sorry about yesterday. I didn't mean to come off... Oh, no. No. Me, I... I'm sorry I was such a bitch. It was... A long day. I'm sure it was. I'm Jason Street. Uh... Suzy Quinlan. Nice to meet you. So, uh... So do you work for the team? Oh, no. That was, uh... That was just a day job. I'm trying to get my business off the ground and... What's your... What's your... Every little bit helps. What's your business? Ink. I'm a tattoo artist. Seriously? (CHUCKLING) Seriously. That's awesome. Are these yours? All right. There's four of them. Thanks, man. 
 
 Hey, Coach. We got a problem. It's about the camera. What about the camera? Uh... one of the assistant coaches saw Walt Riggins going in the A.V. Room right before the camera went missing. Which coach? Corelli. Saw Tim Riggins' dad come out of the A.V. Room? Yep. Camera was there. He goes in the room. He comes out. It's gone. What do you want me to do? Don't do anything. I'll take care of it. Thanks. Yeah. How you doing? Fine. How are you? Good. Good. Sorry to bother you at home. Uh... No, it's not a bother. What can I do for you? Well, uh... We're missing a camera from the A.V. Department. Well, are you going door to door and asking all the parents about this? No, I'm not. Well, I... I don't know... Well, I'll tell you, we have a coach over at the uh... Over at the school. He saw you walk out of the, uh... the A.V. Room. So... He said he doesn't know where the camera is, Coach. What else do you need? All right. I'm sorry to bother you. Uh... Thank you. Thank you for your time. Hey, Coach? Yeah? You go to Bradley's place and ask his dad if he stole the camera? No, I didn't do that. Well, I'm just curious why did you come to mine then. I didn't know you were there. I'm sorry. Granted he's made some mistakes, Coach, but that's my father in there. You're right. I apologize. I'll see you at practice. Angela, please. Earl Stackhouse. He's my buddy. He needs a front-office girl. I told him how great you were. I'm sorry. I mean I know what I said but I mean in the heat of passion... Here's hundreds. Here's six, seven hundred dollars. Just walking around money, okay? Can we just make this easy? I'm sorry. You're gonna be all right. So what was it like? Your first time? Do you ever watch the nature channel? I'm really... I'm just kidding. Okay? Oh. Okay. You don't have to do this. You know that, right? Yeah, I know that. I just... I want to. Because there will always be a steady stream of horny football players in Dillon. I can guarantee. (BOTH LAUGHING) No, that... I mean... Matt's different and I really like him. And he likes me and it's just the perfect opportunity for me to control the whole experience. You know? Get the information and gather the data. Wow. That sounds real hot. (CLEARING HER THROAT) For Matt. Throw the guy a bone while you're gathering your data. As soon as it left my hands, I knew it was bad. I saw him running and I was the only one that had a clean shot at him. And the only thing going through my head was that I wanted to kill him. I wanted to obliterate him. I put my head down and I went right into him. I guess the next thing was... That I came to a couple minutes later. And my parents were just standing over me. And my dad was just holding my mom. She was screaming and he was crying. First time I'd ever seen my dad cry. And he just kept saying, "Get up, son. Get up. "Get up, son." And... I wasn't. I couldn't. Couldn't do it. I think if... If it was me I would spend my whole life wondering why. Yeah, there's a... There's a lot of that. There's a lot of that. You just get angry, you know? And... You start wondering, you know, "God, did you do this to me?" You know? Was it fate? Was it just some dumb accident? Was it my fault? And I prayed and prayed and prayed and the only answer I ever got was that I couldn't walk. I can't walk. So... I'm just ready to get rid of that, you know? Get rid of that anger, and just... Just have some peace. Hey, "After School Special." I wanna show you something. This is the best juke box in town. (PEOPLE CHEERING) Guy 2 : You got that right! How about that? Let's go, "After School Special." Dance party! Dance party. Oh, yeah! Wanna get out of here? Yeah. Jason : What... What's this one? Oh, that's the Chinese symbol for "wealth." It's also the Chinese symbol for "douche." Do they have a Chinese symbol for "crippled?" No Chinese symbols. No barbed wire and no naked ladies. Just hold on there, shooter. I'm looking for something. I just can't find it. This your station? Yeah, right there. What's uh... What's this one? Which ones? These uh... The red, yellow and blue. Oh. That was the wallpaper in the hallway at my grandma's house. Y'all were close? No! She was a bitch on wheels and everyone was glad when she died. Nice. But I think the wallpaper was pretty. Oh, here it is. Found it. Sanskrit. This top one. It says "peace." It's perfect. (SPORTS ANNOUNCER CHATTERING) How you feeling, buddy? Want me to cook you up an omelet? No, I'm good, Dad. I'm gonna fix my headlight. I... I was gonna take that back. I swear. I defended you, Dad. Timmy, this is no big deal. No, it is. You know that. I want you to leave. Get out! Okay. You see how easy this is, son... Just watch this. Nuh-uh. (CAR DOOR CLOSING) (KNOCKING ON DOOR) Hey. Hey. Did Tyra drive you? Uh... yeah. Okay. So my parents think I'm at Lois' and I need to be home by eleven. So we should get right down to the s*x then. Right? Good. Where in the bathroom is the aspirin? Well, look in the, um... Underneath the sink. I poured you some wine. That might help. Hey, were you planning something special for tonight? Yes, I'm making you a beautiful dinner. Just poured you a glass of wine. And if you get rid of that headache, you may get lucky, darling. What's this? These yours? No. Well, they're sure as hell not mine. So what would our 15 year old daughter be doing with these? Yeah. I think I need to talk to you for a second, hon. I... I saw Matt Saracen buying condoms earlier this week. I'm sorry. Say that again. You heard what I said. Oh, I'd love to hear you say that again. No, I'm not gonna say it. And you were gonna tell me this when? I talked to Julie about it. Oh, you did? Well, yeah. I did. You did. And did you also tell her that if he even touches a hair on her head, that's she's gonna be sent to a nunnery in Rome and I'm gonna rip his head off right afterwards? No. No, but what I told her is that she's too young and that she's not ready. And then I tried to make the best case that I could against it. Well, that's good. It might even help if we get her her own apartment. 'Cause that's pretty darn stern. The reason I didn't consult with you and I didn't talk to you about it is because I felt that you might start to freak out. Where is she right now? 'Cause I think what you're doing right now... Where is she right now? She's at Lois' now. Studying. Wait. Wait a second. Hey, how you doing? (STAMMERING) This is Coach Taylor. Sir... Yeah, hey. This is Coach Taylor. I was just wondering if my daughter's over there. Yes, sir. Do you know if she was planning on coming over there or... No, everything's fine. Okay. Thank you. Why don't you find out where our daughter is? Hey. What are you doing back here? You're not supposed to be in the kitchen. Can you take a break? No. No. It's the dinner rush and you know, my manager's breathing down my back. I got a table full of crazy middle-aged women. No, I can't take a break. I'm sorry. What? Forget it. Tim. What? The deer's staring at me. Deer's... Well, it's, um... Don't look at it. (JULIE GIGGLING) I just... I feel like it's judging me. Can... can you cover it up or something? Yeah. Here. Uh... All right. Good, see? Uh... He's asleep now. See, it's hard not too look at you 'cause you're so good looking. There you go. Is it really hot in here? Um... Yeah, I guess. You want me to open a window? Yeah. That'd be really great. All right. Okay. Good. Now it's cooler. Does it smell like wet dog? You know what? Let's not do this. No, no, no, no, no. I... I told you I want to... No, no, no, no, no. You really don't. And that's okay 'cause... We don't have to. We... We don't? No. We can just hang out or, uh... Eat, or I don't know. Whatever. Really? Yeah. Oh, but don't touch me right now. That's... Just gimme a minute, please. Yeah. Yeah. What time is it? You know, you and I have the exact same amount of experience being parents. We've been doing this job the same number of years and months and days as each other and the truth of it is that we just don't have any control. You know? For the most part, we're just winging it. And I'm... I don't know what to do. I don't know what to do in this situation. But I'll tell you what. The most important thing to me is that my daughter be able to talk to me. A girl is entitled to that with her mother. My mother used to tell me that I was gonna go to hell if a guy ever even touched me, and you know that didn't work. I'm sure as hell not gonna do that to Julie. And we raised a smart, responsible, moral girl. And I have faith in us. And I have faith in her. And now we just gotta let her go. I'm sorry if I hurt you. Both : One, two, three! Oh, see... Oh, wait! No, you gotta keep your hand... Hey, you're cheating! I can't win if I don't cheat. Oh, those... Those are very good ethics right there. That's great. Oh, wait. You have the ugliest feet I have ever seen. Oh, shut up! I do not! No, you do. No, they're really gross. And because... look, your second toe is all bigger than your first toe. It's a sign of royalty. Oh, yeah? What are you? Like the "Royal Duchess of Dillon" or something? Okay. Look who's talking, Mr. "I Have Dirt All Over My Feet"! Well, I mean... Oh, my God, we were gonna have s*x tonight. And you didn't even clean the bottoms of your feet. I was gonna keep my socks on. Ew! Whatever. Come here. Ready? Let's go. One more time. Okay. Okay. Ready? Okay, you ready? Both : One, two, three! (MELANCHOLIC MUSIC PLAYING) Hey, Buck. Amateur hour. There's that punk kid from the other night. Come on, fellas. Let's have some fun. Buck : Yeah! He fire you? Thank you. Mr. Garrity fired you? Why? I really don't want all these questions with you nagging me... Did something happen? Everything. I don't wanna talk about it right now. (CELL PHONE RINGING) But... I... Hello? Hey, Tyra. It's Teresa. Your boy Tim's here fixing to get his ass kicked. Okay. I gotta go. I'll be back. We're gonna finish this later. Come on, boy! What's it gonna be? Huh? What you got for me? Croanie : Give him hell, Buck. Buck : Come on, man. What you got? Your daddy ain't here to help you out, huh? (MEN SHOUTING) Get the hell off him, man! Get the hell of him! Buck : What are you doing? Come on. He's the one that kept it going! He's just a kid, man! Where's that beer? Hey, um... Jules? Mmm-hmm? It's kinda... It's kinda, um... Oh, my God. Oh, my God. We are so dead. What do you wanna... Um... Kill the lights. Where are my keys? You want me to walk you to the door or something? Are you kidding me? My dad's gonna kill you if he sees you. Where are my keys? Julie, I love you. Um... what? I love you. Um... Uh... Me, too. I love you, too. Um... I'll call you later. Okay. Bye. Bye. (DOOR OPENING) Uh... Are you all right? Taylor : Are you all right? Uh... yeah. I'm fine. Uh... I'm sorry. I... And I know I'm late and I know I should've called 'cause that's the whole reason you guys bought me the cell phone and I'm probably grounded for the rest of my life. But I just I was with Matt and we fell asleep and... Uh, no, no, no, no. Nothing like that happened. Not what you're thinking happened. 'Cause that didn't happen and I swear to you guys that nothing happened, Good night. And, uh... Yeah. Um... But, um... Thanks for the talk. Good night. Reverend : Seeing the cross of sacrifice and the empty tomb, we rejoice in the awesome love of our lord, Jesus. And we take comfort in the eternal forgiveness that God gives to all who believe in Jesus and walk with him. Let us go in peace and serve the Lord. Reverend : Amen ALL: Amen. Amen. So I was thinking. You know when we're at the, uh... The store, we could get a newspaper. Look through the want ads. Or you know we could go see a movie. That might, you know, make you feel better. What? Where are we going? Mother... What are we doing here? Mom. Mom! Just stay in the car. What... What? Stay in the car I said! What are you doing? Momma? Mother? Momma? Hey! Buddy! Oh, God! Oh... You lying son of a bitch! Hey... You lying son of a bitch! Easy now... You son of a bitch! Son of a bitch! You could've at least let me keep the job! It's all right. (CHUCKLING NERVOUSLY) What were you thinking? Pam. What the hell happened to you? I, uh... I brought you something. You all right? Why don't you come inside? See you at practice.
