 You look good. 
 Like, real good. 
 Probably because yesterday I was baptized, and accepted Jesus as my Lord and Savior. 
 Still the best I've ever had. 
 Just be honest with me. 
 Nothing seems right anymore. 
 I just really need some space. 
 What's Buddy doing here? 
 Watching practice. 
 I run closed practices. 
 Send him home. 
 Carl called. They need me to come back Friday. 
 You're supposed to have two weeks. 
 Just told me I'll never walk again. 
 I know this guy. 
 He does some experimental stem cell surgeries down in Mexico. 
 I am so glad he's dead. 
 I wish I was the one who killed him. 
 Don't say that. 
 No. 
 We're gonna be okay. 
 Just three days, folks, till all our questions are answered on Herrmann field... 
 I'm sorry. I... I... 
 I didn't mean to... 
 ...when our Panthers take on the Rattlers. Sorry. 
 Okay. I got it. 
 You can just go back to sleep if you want to. 
 Hmm. 
 Morning. 
 Landry... 
 I'm sure whatever that you're about to say is going to make perfect sense and be absolutely practical, and basically ruin the best night of my life. 
 Look, this just can't happen again. 
 Okay. All right. 
 All right? 
 I have to go. 
 All right. 
 I'll see you. 
 At school. 
 You'll see me at school. 
 It'll all be fine. 
 We'll be... 
 You just gonna go out the window? 
 Yeah, I'm just gonna go out... 
 Okay. You need some help? 
 No, I'm good. 
 I'm good. 
 Yeah. I'll see you. 
 You got it? 
 Yeah, I'm good. 
 I'll talk to you later. Okay. 
 Bye, baby. 
 Thank you. 
 I gotta get going. 
 Well, that just sucks. 
 Yeah, we're all waiting to see how Coach MacGregor can pick up the slack after He Who Shall Remain Nameless, a. k. a. Coach Taylor. 
 A.k. a. Judas! 
 Yeah, he cashed in on us by taking his college job just as fast as was humanly possible. 
 That's right, but let's turn our attention now to the game... Hey, Coach. Here's your order. Thank you. I know you're in a hurry to hit the road. All right. Thanks. Sorry about the radio. It's fine. Have a good one. Hey, thanks guys. Hey! Coach? Hey, Matt. How you doing? I... I just wanted to apologize for everything with Julie. Apologize? Yeah. Apologize for what? It was just that we broke up. I didn't know that you were broke up. She probably just didn't want to bother... You know... Especially while you're in Austin. Tell Mrs. Taylor I'm sorry, too. All right. I'll see... Come on, Riggins! You have this half-ass, candy-ass, lame-ass, whiskey-breath, dirty-hair attitude! You're gonna wake up in the morning, you'll find your career gone! Gone like a memory! Like a postcard! Like a bad dream! Like a love affair! Like a night train! Get those knees up in the air and get that tire up! Wear it like a crown! Praise the game of football! That's what I want to see! Show me something! Show me something! That's it! Yeah! You're in it now! Get up, Riggins! Hey, Riggins? You all right? Tim? Get a trainer in here! Get up! Stay back, boys. Give him some air. Give him some room. Got it? Go ahead and call it in. What the hell do you think you're doing to yourself, Tim? You're completely dehydrated. Your body went into shock. Whose wouldn't? I don't understand what you're trying to do to yourself. The front desk can't get a hold of Billy to come down and pick you up. Yeah, he's probably screwing my ex-girlfriend. And we can't release you without an adult signature, so any other relative we could call? No. Okay. Then we'll keep trying Billy. Hey. You ready for Friday? Always, sir. Attaboy. How are you feeling? I am feeling a bit better now. You should try going to practice without a hangover. I hear it's a totally different game. Yeah, that's kind of what I'm afraid of. So, uh... You just come here to check up on me? I'm here as a friend. It's the least I can do after you helped me with my dad the other night. What? Um... What? I think you should come to my church. Uh... Is this like a recruitment deal you got going? You know, "Get them when they're down. " No. No, I care about you, Tim. What? Is that the idea? I care about you. And I see that you're lost, which is exactly how I felt. I'm not lost. This is Dillon. It's home of the Panthers, right? You can be lost in Dillon, you know. Hit it. Right. Okay, let me ask you. Are you trying to be a cliché? I mean, stem cell surgery in Mexico? Oh, let me check my watch. Yeah. Been about a year. Yeah. You're actually right on time for the miracle surgery portion of the show. It's not a miracle surgery. Come on! Get it! Look, I'm not crazy, This isn't insane. They're getting great results with rats. They're getting movement back in their hind legs from this. I hate to break it to you, buddy, but you don't have hind legs, so you're screwed. I wanted to walk, too. We all did. But you actually thinking you're gonna do it again... People will take advantage of that, Street. They'll take your money and what's left of your dignity and... It's a scam, Q.B. Don't say you weren't warned. Move! Let's go! Coach, I don't think this is gonna work. Son, it's a five-step drop. You settle in, find the lane, get rid of the ball. Is there anything magical about that? Huh? Come on. Let's go. Hey. Trust me. All right. Now with Jackson, we got the height problem, of course. He's having trouble seeing the lanes. I got him in the five-step drop. He's catching up with the receivers, but I'll put him in a shorter drop once... Cut the kid loose. We don't need him. Well, Coach, I think that's a bit premature. Uh... Taylor. He's got some talent. Just cut the boy. He's not performing. We don't have time to waste with this. Tell him he's gone and start focusing on that kid from Midland. You... You want me to tell him? Yeah. Hey, babe. How you doing? Hey, baby. How's your day going? I'm doing all right. I've got the distinct privilege of cutting one of the kids from the team today. I'm sorry. Hey, did you try turning it off, then turning it on again? Yes. Yes. That's what I was doing. Okay. Who's that? That's Glenn, darling. What's Glenn doing at the house? Glenn is here helping me at the moment, trying to get the icemaker to work. I don't want Glenn over at the house with his hands in my wife's icebox. You tell him to leave it alone. I'll fix it when I get home on the weekend. All right, sweetheart. That'll be great. Well, is that what you called to talk to me about? No. Listen. Did you forget to tell me that Julie and Matt broke up? No, Julie and Matt didn't break up. Yeah, they did. It's all over the school. It's huge. Everybody's talking about it. Hey, babe. Tell Glenn to sit down and be quiet. No, honey. I did not know that Julie and Matt broke up. Don't you think that's a little bit of a problem, maybe? I do. I think that's a problem that she didn't say anything to me. What would you say is the main difference in this year's team? Well, for one, Coach M is stressing the running game. That's for one. And... You know, if he wants to put the ball in my hands, I know I can carry it. As in "carry the team"? No, I wouldn't say that. But I'll put it like this. The Smash is in the zone like never before. Oh, I'm ready to run with that ball. Saracen, you hearing this guy? He's out of control, man. Listen, somebody's gotta say something to him. I'll say something. Tim Riggins. Mr. Garrity? Yeah. You doing okay? Yes, sir. Good. Good. You've been through a traumatic experience. I'm gonna sign you out right now. That guy's pushing you guys way too hard. He's got you out there running in the hot, blazing sun. Showing no mercy. And I got from my inside sources that the practices have been running over 15 minutes. Ran over today. It's no wonder you passed out. Actually, I think I passed out 'cause I was hung over, Mr. Garrity. Sir? I want you to listen to me, Tim Riggins. I don't want to ever hear you say that again. Now, I've seen you play with a hangover many times and you played like a champ. This is because of that coach. This is all about MacGregor, and I don't want you to put any of it on yourself. Okay? Okay. Okay. Hey, Smash? Can I talk to you for a minute? Sure, Matty. What's up? Look. Some of... Some of the guys on the team have kind of been talking a little bit. Some of the guys, huh? Yeah. They kind of feel like there's, sort of, some inequity. Oh, Matty. What you bringing out the $10 words on me for, man? What's up? Smash, you're not the only person on this team. Okay? Yeah, I know that. Then why don't you act like it? I mean, this team's kind of just falling apart, and we're supposed to be leaders, so we should be trying to bring... Look, look, Matty... Ain't none of this my fault. If y'all are mad 'cause Coach is making this a running offense, go talk to him. Ain't nothing I can do about it. There's nothing you can do about it? What you want me to do? Go tell Coach MacGregor to change his strategy? No, but I want you to act like a captain because you are the captain. So step up and try and, you know, bring people... Oh! Oh, so you're pissed 'cause he made me captain. No, I don't care that he made you captain. I really do not. I... Look, I'm sorry he's not using you the way that Coach Taylor did. You wanna get real? Let's get real. Yeah, I'm loving this. Why shouldn't I? It's my year. I'm a senior. Why shouldn't I be the star? This is my recruitment year. Okay? My future's on the line every Friday night. I gotta do what's best for me right now. And at the end of this, I'll graduate and it'll be your turn. Live with it, Matt. What's up, girl? Step up and I'll give you a ride. Yuppy-yup? Hey, girl. I got you some clean laundry, finally. It's okay. You can just leave it there. I'll deal with it. I don't mind, sweetheart. So did I hear that you and Matt Saracen broke up? Yep. How are you doing with that? Fine. Well, who broke up with who? Mom, look. I really just... Don't really want to talk about it. Okay? Was it 'cause of that boy at the pool? No. Honey, I just want you to know I'm here for you, hon. And you can always talk to me. Okay. Thanks. I think your baby's crying. There's not really any prime-time apples. All right. What're you talking about? Hut! There we go. That's a good catch, Smash. Take a little bit of air off that, all right? Good catch, Smash. Look at this. Look at this. Ladies, glad you decided to join us today. Let's get a little jog going. That means you, too, Saracen! Red jersey does not mean you get to walk today. Opening day is upon us, gentlemen! Get your asses in motion. Bradley, didn't we tell you to lose that baby fat in the off-season? You can't tell, man? I lost three pounds. Tip of the iceberg, Bradley. The StairMaster is your friend. Okay? Gentlemen, we get better or we get worse every day! Let's get a little better today. We need Riggins to bring his A game for Friday night. You should go over to his house and talk to him. You know, pump him up. Can you do that? Yes, sir. Thank you, Coach. Thank you, Coach. All right. All right. Riggins! Timmy! Tim! Yeah? Timmy, open the damn door! Yeah. What's going on, Jay? Missed your practice today, Riggs. Well, yeah. Doc told me to rest, so... I'm resting. Yeah, did he prescribe you a 12-pack, too? No, that was me. What the hell are you doing, Tim? Seriously. Am I talking to "Coach Street" or "friend Street"? Don't go there, Tim. Because you've been pretty confused lately. Tim. Don't go there. All right? I just... Did Coach MacGregor give you a gold star for this one? Coming over here? Shut the hell up, Riggins! That's not what this is about! All right? This isn't about Coach or me. This is about you. Tim, look at yourself. You're a screw-up! You're the one that didn't show up. You're the one that's always late. You're the one that doesn't take your life seriously. You know, when you make the choice between friend and coach, pick friend, because you make a lousy coach. Clean yourself up and get your ass to practice. Great coaching tactic. I mean, that fire under my ass has been lit! Go to hell, Riggins! Go to hell, Tim. Hey, Carlotta? Yes? I'm kind of noticing a sort of a little bit of... Of a trend going on. A trend? Yeah. It seems like everybody's laundry is done except for mine. 'Cause Grandma's got a lot of clean clothes here and I see some of yours. And I got no clean socks. Oh, then I suggest you wash some. Right. And I will wash it, it's just, you know, I gotta go to school and I got two practices a day and I gotta go to work. So... You know, I... I just sort of thought that maybe you'd be helping out in that whole area. Why? Because I have brown skin? No, not because... But just... I didn't think it was that crazy an idea to think that maybe you... I have a job, taking care of your grandmother. I am a caregiver, not a maid. I'm an A student. My father in Guatemala is a teacher, and my mother runs an insurance office. I came here to put myself through college. To study to be a nurse. To help people. And not to do your laundry. Right. But doing laundry helps people. The washing machine is over there. Hey, sweetie. How's my girl? All right. Landry, how was school today? You know. Not bad. Same old same old. You making any new or different friends now that you're a Panther? Not... Not really. Pretty much just the same old friends. Well, you gotta be meeting some girls, don't you? I mean, maybe... Maybe a little bit. But it's nothing... Nothing to write home about. Mom got these crackers that you like. Oh, that is sin in a box. Uh-uh. Hey, bubba. Where's your watch? Um... It's in... It's in a drawer. I had it cleaned. Glad to hear you're taking good care of it. That watch has been in the family over 60 years. Your grandpa's going to want to see you wearing it when he comes out here next month. He's gonna see it. Baby, what's for dinner? Pork chops and wild rice and Caesar salad. 
 
 All right, boys! Let's go! Good practice. Good practice. Hello? Yeah, we need to talk. Listen, Buddy. Let me talk to you after practice. All right? No, actually, I mean in person. It's important. What's it about? I can't tell you. What do you mean you can't tell me? Is someone dead or something? What? If I told you, you wouldn't come. That's why. Now listen. I'll meet you halfway. It'll take about two hours for each of us to drive there. Damn it, Buddy. Don't do this. I'm not gonna come somewhere to meet you when you were just telling me that if I knew what it was, I wouldn't come in the first place. Eric, you need to make time for this. I'm telling you this as your friend. It's important. I'll call you back. Let's go. Break it down. Another productive day at the office, I see. You screwing Jackie? Why would you ask me that? 'Cause I saw you sneaking out of her place at 6:00 in the morning. Look. I, uh... I would've told you. Jackie wasn't comfortable with it. We've been seeing each other for about six weeks now. It's pretty serious. You didn't really think that you two were gonna ever have any... Some kind of serious relationship, did you? Why not? 'Cause she's a 33-year-old woman and you're a 17-year-old kid. You... You can't even take care of yourself! How the hell were you planning on taking care of her? Now come here when I'm talking to you, Tim! Tim! Everybody say, "Amen!" Jesus said, "If you will just repent "and be sorry for your past, "I will take all of your past away. " Hallelujah! Just say, "Forgive me! "Forgive me of my past. " And then he said, "Follow me in my burial. " First of all, you follow Jesus in his death. You have a past that you cannot do away with. You have a past that if you even think about it, it brings so many horrible memories to you. I know the drugs and I know all the immorality, and I know all the things you've done because I deal with it every day in different people. I speak to that special person again in this building, that you think God no longer loves you. He loves you very, very much. And the person that invited you to come to church tonight is God's agent. He used that agent so that you could be brought back into the presence of God. And tonight he is going to touch you. Let's do that chorus one more time. I want to sit I want to sit at your feet Drink from the cup in your hand Lay back against you and breathe It's overwhelming. All right. If we win that game on Friday, you gotta give me a massage. Hmm... Like a full body massage? Yeah, I'm gonna need that deep tissue. You good with that? It might cost you. Smash, you didn't happen to bring any of those burgers up from the freezer, did you? Hey, man. I've been on the counter. I've been busy. Yeah, I can see that you've been real busy. Hey, would you calm down, Mr. Manager? I'm doing my job, okay? Yeah, you're working it all right. It's going real quick. Come on, Matty. We gotta get the healing going on. We got opening game on Friday. Yeah, so maybe you get to work and I do my work, then we can get out of here a lot quicker and start thinking about our game on Friday. This one kind of looks like it. Well, it really doesn't look anything like it except for the fact that they are both watches and have hands that tell time. You don't have to say anything to this. But, I mean, if my watch is found with the body, I'm gonna be completely implicated. Which I... Whatever. That's fine. I mean, I did it. But I'm not... I'm not gonna do anything to drag you into it. I promise. I'll do everything in my power to keep you out of it. Keep you safe. I just wanted to say. Well, you know, I just figured I could always kill you to keep you silent. That was creepy. Hi. Tim. What are you... Get out of my room. Who let you in? Little Garrity. Get out. Two minutes. Please. Get out. What are you doing here? Please. Tim. Two minutes. That's all I'm asking. That's it. Okay. Two minutes. It's late, Tim. Something happened to me last night that... I have no idea what it was, but I felt something. Okay. I felt something so strong that it made me wonder about everything you've been saying isn't as crazy as what everyone thought. It's hard for me to understand the feeling. Listen. It's okay. It's kind of embarrassing. It's okay. It allowed me to feel part of something. Mmm-hmm. Part of the people. Part of you. Part of God. Even saying that is scary. Hmm. Do you feel it? Yeah, I felt it. I always feel it. Sorry. What are you doing? I don't know. I don't know what I'm doing, Lyla. I guess I feel closer to God if I'm with you. You feel closer to God when you're with me? I'm sorry. Did you think that line was going to work on me? It's not a line. Get out. Go. All right. The team is screwed. It's screwed. There's no leadership. And it's all because of MacGregor. There's something wrong with that guy. He's mean. I think he's evil. You're sure you're not just pissed off 'cause he kicked you off the field and took the barbeque out of the dealership? I mean, come on. I hate his guts, but that's not the reason. Well, just out of curiosity, what is the reason that I am here right now? What if I told you that I could make him go away and you could have your job back? I'd say you're crazy. I'd say you're crazy and I got a job. Look. I'm not gonna get rid of the guy unless I know that you will come back. What are you? Crazy? You got anything else? 'Cause I'm getting ready to scoot. Yeah. I got something. Go ahead. I got something. Throw it at me. I've seen Tami. I've seen Julie. Tami's trying to be so brave and so strong without her husband here. And I see how sad she is. I see Julie walking around in things she shouldn't be wearing, hanging out with kids she shouldn't be hanging out with. And you know that little baby Gracie misses her daddy. You know it. First year of her life, she never sees her daddy. Your family needs you. They miss you. And I know you miss your family. So I want you to think about this for one minute. If you could just go back in time, and make the TMU job go away, and be the coach of the Panthers again, would you do it? Jules. This is your mother. It's past 2:00 in the morning, and you had best call me as fast as you can. So, I don't want to beat a dead horse, but let's go over it again. The vampire is real. The moon isn't real. The moon isn't? No. No, the landing wasn't real... No, the moon isn't real, Dylan. Dinosaur in the Congo. Oh, yeah. One world government and Al Gore is the Commissar of the whole thing. Wait, the one where Al Gore is a robot? So is your mother. IPods have a mind of their own and they will actually take us all over in a short amount of weeks. Hyperbolic Time Chambers. Nanotechnology. Nanotechnology! There you go. Good one. And then there's the whole global warming issue, which is some big giant diabolical illusion created by the EPA, who are out there strangling polar bears with their bare hands. Whoa! "Strangling polar bears. " Nice, nice. Get in that house right now! Get in the house right now, Julie. Julie, you should go in the house. Get in there! I'm not going in. Take me somewhere. Julie, I can't take you anywhere. That's kidnapping. I don't care. Take me somewhere. Get in there right now. I'm not going in. Get out. I'm not going in! What is wrong with you? Get out! You've totally lost it! I'm not getting out! What the hell are you doing? Get out now! I am your mother! All right? And you have not grown up yet and you are not rid of me yet. You hear? Go to hell! You got rid of me when you had Gracie and Dad left. Do you know what? You need to learn to live with that. Hi. Welcome to Applebee's. What can I get for you? I'm gonna have that quesadilla burger and an iced tea. All right. So, tell me something. Are you and my son dating? I... I... Well, I don't know, actually. 'Cause I have to tell you, I really don't get it. I mean, no disrespect intended, but as a parent, I just don't understand it. I mean, you could date pretty much anyone you want to. What do you want with my kid Landry? Landry, he's... He's a wonderful guy. He's smart and kind and he's caring. He's funny and he's really nice to be around. You should know that, being his father and all. I appreciate that. You want that burger medium or well done? Medium's fine. Okay. Thank you. Friday night at last! Friday night at last! Thank God almighty, it's Friday night at last! A whole new season, a new coach, and maybe a whole new era for Panther football. This team has been to the top of the mountain, and we all know the higher the mountain, the further the fall. Let's look for Coach MacGregor to give the ball to his big, bright, shining star, Brian "Smash" Williams. Coach MacGregor's made it clear that Smash Williams will be getting busy tonight. We got The Smash! We got The Smash! What? What? Keep that going! Keep that going, baby! One thing's for sure. Coach MacGregor should be starting his regime with a victory tonight. Now even though there are rumblings of dissension in the locker room, hopefully it won't make its way onto the field. It's a big high bomber, and the Rattlers take it deep in their own end zone. Jones out to the five. He breaks right. Oh! Great move inside! He cuts the edge! The 40! The 50! He's crossed midfield! Oh, my! And down he goes at the Panther 40. Mercy me, folks. Expectations are sky high here in Dillon, and if MacGregor expects to walk in the boots of the great Eric Taylor, he'd better get a hold of this game quick, because these Rattlers have come to play. Black 53! Hut! Quick pitch to Williams up the middle. And just like that, Smash rips off eight yards and the Panthers are on their way! Coach. I... I think we gotta freeze those linebackers. Maybe a play action to the tight end. Not right now, okay? We can freeze them. Not right now. Right now, just let me coach, all right? Come on out! Hut! Saracen opens left. Pitch to Smash. Oh, no! It's on the carpet! Williams picks it up. He's got nowhere to go! What was that? Second 19. Let's go! Come on now! Hut! Saracen rolls left. He's got Williams in the flat. Oh! Interception! Oh, my! What the hell was that? What the hell was that? I lost it, all right? Put the ball in my hands. It got away from me. Just put the ball in my hands, baby. Maybe turn around... Come here! You guys make it work! I wanna see you work out there. We'll get it working. Come on. Get your head back in the game, baby. It'll be there. Come on, man. We can do this. Come on. I'm here. I'm right here. Well, let's go ahead and do something then. All right. Come on, D! Next time we get the ball, I think it's time to go against the grain, Coach. Play action over the top to a wide receiver. You... You know what? We've got a situation right now and we're on D, all right? I understand that, Coach. I don't have time to take advice from the team mascot. All right? I'm a little busy. Come on now! I'm talking to you, 52! 52, come on! It's on you! Late in the fourth quarter, gridlocked at zeroes. The Panther blowout did not happen and now it's gut-check time. Hut! Saracen opens left. Whoa! It's a busted play! Go! Down goes Saracen. Oh! What am I seeing? MacGregor looks very unhappy. He's pulling Smash Williams over to the sideline. Looks like he's giving Smash the play. Here we go. Hey! What's the play? Go 90-24 arrow! Let's go, Blue! Set! Blue 80! Panthers in shotgun... Blue 80! ...with time running out. Hut! Oh! It's a direct snap to Williams! He powers up the middle! Come on! Go! Oh! He breaks a tackle! Touchdown! Yes! Smash Williams has carried this team on his back and he has just brought home the W for Dillon! You know, I think Coach MacGregor might have made a big statement right there. Saracen was out of the play completely. Used him as a decoy. Looks like he just rewired his offense. Are you sure? What's up? Spit in the fire and call the dogs, Smash Williams is the Dillon Panther offense. Nice job, Matt. You gonna get yours next time. Brian! Come on! Whoa! Whoa! Get off me! Get off of me! Get off! You want some, you'll get it! No, you want some? Come on! You lost your mind, man! What's wrong with you? Get your hands off of me! What's wrong with y'all? Take them inside, Smiley. Hi. Hi. You're home. Don't trip over the laundry. Did you see the game tonight? Did you hear what happened at the game tonight? Mmm-hmm. I hit Julie last night. Right across the face. I slapped her. I don't know what's happening with our family and... It's all right. All right. You could have knocked, Six. I came here to tell you something tonight, Tim. It's the only reason I'm here. And to put an end to this so-called "friendship" that we got. I quit the team tonight. And I didn't want you to think for one second it had anything to do with the fact that you told me I suck as a coach. 'Cause A, I don't care what you think. And B, I don't suck. I'm an awesome coach. It's just, with MacGregor around, there's not a whole hell of a lot for me to do. That's good, 'cause I got more important things to do. I'm going to Mexico. I'm gonna have surgery. And I'll probably be walking next time you see me. So you better look out 'cause the first thing I'm gonna do is walk over here so I can kick your ass. 'Cause you are the worst and stupidest friend that a guy could ever have in this world. I pretty much hate your guts right now, I'm so disgusted in you. I'm disappointed. Mexico, huh? Hi. What are you... What are you... Are you okay? Yeah. No, I'm good. Well... You okay? Yeah, no. I just... Tyra, look. We don't have to do that. Just... You know what? I don't want you to regret... Just... Just be quiet. No one's ever cared for me so much. Here. No. Put it away. We're going to Mexico. What do you mean, "Put it away"? We're still in Texas, you idiot. Have we got a map? Yes, I have a map. Well, what are you waiting for? Let's go. Hi. Hi. There's some food on the stove. I'm not really hungry. You look like hell. Thanks. I think I did something to my shoulder. Sit down. Let me look at it. I mean, it's not that bad. Sit down. You sure you know what you're doing? Yes! Sit down. It's just, you know, you're not a nurse yet. Okay. Shut up. You're not... You're still in school. Turn to me. Here? Yeah. Here? Uh-huh. Here? Yeah. Better? Yeah, a little bit. What is that? A song my mom sang to us when we got hurt. It's hard to translate because it's nonsense. Something about a frog and a butt and a saint. Seriously. That's funny. The point of it is, however, that if things are not good today, they will be better tomorrow. Things will be better. Yes! We going to rock and roll? I sure as hell hope I don't regret this. No way. Let's go in. You got a drink? Yes, I do. Yes, I do.
