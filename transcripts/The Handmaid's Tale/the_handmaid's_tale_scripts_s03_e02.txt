 NARRATOR:  Previously on The Handmaid's Tale...   
 We can get you out! You and the baby.   
 But you have to go right now!   
 - Who's "we"? 
- Marthas. Go!   
 Do you know Commander Mackenzie?   
 He has a daughter.   
 I can't leave without her.   
 I'll take you to Mackenzie.   
 - [INDISTINCT SHOUTING] 
- GUARDIAN: Don't move!    
 MRS. MCKENZIE: You're being cruel.    
 Confusing her like this.    
 I'm confusing her?    
 [WHISPERS] You're gonna see your son again.    
 I'm not his mother anymore.    
 Of course you are. 
Your son is in Canada.    
 He's free. With your wife.    
 [DRAMATIC MUSIC]    
 [CRIES OUT]    
 MARTHA: Call an ambulance.    
 Dear Lord, what have you done?    
 OFFICER: As a person in need of protection, do you wish to seek asylum in the country of Canada?    
 - Yes. 
- WATERFORD: God has made me master of an incredible woman.    
 SERENA: You don't need to protect me.    
 - EMILY: Are you Luke? 
- Yeah.    
 Your wife saved my life.    
 They're safe. Emily and the baby.    
 They made it.    
 AUNT ELIZABETH: You've got a new posting.    
 You're not gonna be any trouble, are you?    
 No, sir.    
 [BIRDS CHIRPING]    
 [PENSIVE MUSIC]    
 JUNE:  I used to be bad at waiting.   
 [HELICOPTER FLIES OVERHEAD]    
 "They also serve who stand and wait,"   
 Aunt Lydia said.   
 She also said,   
 "Not all of you will make it through.   
 Some of you will fall on dry ground   
 or thorns.   
 Some of you are shallow-rooted.   
 Think of yourselves as seeds.   
 What kind of seed will you be, girls?"   
 I pretend I'm a tree.   
 And I wait.   
 [INDISTINCT CHATTER]    
 HANDMAID: She's very blessed.    
 OFMATTHEW: Blessed be the fruit.    
 May the Lord open.    
 [INDISTINCT RADIO CHATTER]    
 OFMATTHEW: We're about to take back Chicago, my mistress tells me.    
 I will keep our soldiers in my prayers.    
 Praise be.    
 I've been praying for the Waterfords, too.    
 That is kind of you, Ofmatthew.    
 Their poor sweet baby, wherever she is.    
 I can't imagine what came over Ofjoseph.    
 I am Ofjoseph.    
 JUNE:  Now who's the pious little sh1t?   
 [DOOR DINGS]    
 [INDISTINCT RADIO CHATTER]    
 GUARDIAN: Go in grace.    
 [MUZAK PLAYING IN BACKGROUND]    
 HANDMAID: Praise be to you.    
 [INDISTINCT CHATTER]    
 Ofrobert, did you see?    
 They have canned tomatoes.    
 Praise be.    
 OFJOSEPH: Mmm.    
 [INDISTINCT CHATTER]    
 ALMA: Sneaky.    
 OFJOSEPH: I'm learning.    
 Casey had her baby.    
 A shredder.    
 Heart on the outside.    
 OFJOSEPH: That's awful.    
 The Americans are about to lose Chicago.    
 At least that's what Ofmatthew says.    
 Did you ask your Martha about the Mackenzies?    
 ALMA: I tried.    
 She's super mean.    
 I'd leave the Marthas alone.    
 AUNT REBECCA: Do you need help with something?    
 OFJOSEPH: No, thank you.    
 ALMA: The Marthas don't trust us.    
 OFJOSEPH: Who does?    
 They only had golden beets.    
 That's fine. They'll roast up great.    
 [BETH SIGHS]    
 I thought you said steak.    
 This is a filet.    
 Isn't that better?    
 Not if you like flavor.     
 I can go back.     
 BETH: Hope we have enough butter for a Béarnaise sauce.     
 [DOOR OPENS]     
 CORA: Parlor.     
 They're waiting for you.     
 AUNT LYDIA: Blessed be the fruit, dear.     
 May the Lord open.     
 I'm glad to see you're feeling a bit better, Aunt Lydia.     
 Aren't you kind?     
 [SCOFFS]     
 LAWRENCE: I didn't figure I'd see you back in this house any time soon.     
 You've certainly bounced back, haven't you?     
 [SCOFFS]     
 God is merciful indeed.     
 Lydia's here checking up on us.     
 Nothing of the sort.     
 A routine visit to see how our girl is settling into her new household.     
 ELEANOR: She's fine.     
 [ELEANOR CLEARS THROAT]     
 - She's fine. 
- She's fine.     
 Ah, have you found her...     
 ... respectful?     
 We've had trouble with her in the past.     
 Yes.     
 [PLEADINGLY] I want to go now.     
 All right, my love.     
 All right.     
 AUNT LYDIA: And The Ceremony?     
 Our records show that Ofjoseph's fertile time was last week.     
 [OMINOUS MUSIC]     
 [ELEANOR SIGHS] Yep.     
 Aces.     
 Praise be.     
 AUNT LYDIA: Mrs. Lawrence?     
 She's...     
 She's just tired.     
 All right, my love.     
 Pleasure, as always.     
 [FOOTSTEPS RECEDING]     
 What's wrong with her?     
 I don't know.     
 If there is something unseemly going on in this household with Commander Lawrence, you know you can always tell me.     
 Emily was here  two  days and God only knows what he did to her.     
 OFJOSEPH: May I see you out, Aunt Lydia?     
 Thank you.     
 [GRUNTS]     
 [GRUNTS WITH EFFORT]     
 I'd like to look at your room.     
 To see if it's shipshape.     
 All right.     
 [AUNT LYDIA GRUNTS SOFTLY]     
 [CRIES OUT]     
 Are you okay?     
 [AUNT LYDIA GRUNTS]     
 Maybe next time is better.     
 - All right? 
- [AUNT LYDIA GRUNTS]     
 AUNT LYDIA: You shut your mouth!     
 - [CATTLE PROD BUZZES] 
- Ow!     
 AUNT LYDIA: Aunt Elizabeth was soft!     
 I would never have put you in a new posting.     
 After what you pulled at the Mackenzies', you should be on the wall!     
 Everything is...     
 ... in hand, Commander Lawrence.     
 [GROANS]     
 Ofjoseph was seen gossiping at...     
 ... Loaves and Fishes.     
 That simply will not do.     
 LAWRENCE: Spare the rod, spoil the Handmaid, yeah?     
 Something like that.     
 AUNT LYDIA: Quite right.     
 Quite right.     
 Blessed day.     
 Take care, dear.     
 Under His eye.     
 Just...     
 [DOOR OPENS]     
 [DOOR CLOSES]     
 I wonder what the voltage is on those things.     
 [DOOR CLOSES]     
 [INDISTINCT CHATTERING]     
 [CHILDREN PLAYING IN BACKGROUND]     
 MAN:  Hello, you still there?   
 Uh, yeah.     
 Still here.     
 MAN:  You need to drop off The Notarized Form by  :   p.m.   
 LUKE: Uh, no. My lawyer said that she'd drop them off.     
 MAN:  Well, she hasn't.   
 So if they're not there by  :  , the application's rejected.   
 All right. All right, it's fine.     
 I'll be there as soon as I can.     
 Yeah, thanks.     
 [NICHOLE SQUEALS]     
 [NICHOLE CRIES]     
 [NICHOLE COOS]     
 - [NICHOLE SQUEALS] 
- [MOIRA LAUGHS]     
 Yes.     
 Yeah. Oh-oh.     
 Look who's home, Nichole.     
 Hey, come say "hi."     
 [CRYING]     
 LUKE: Hey!     
 I've gotta go to the lawyer's and then the embassy.     
 MOIRA: Oh, come on.     
 Play with her!     
 Or hold her.     
 Just for a minute.     
 Yeah, I gotta, uh...     
 I've gotta get these forms notarized for the National Insurance Number application.     
 Right. You're gonna be back for dinner?     
 ERIN: Emily?     
 Right.     
 [NICHOLE COOS]     
 Yeah, I'm fine with it.     
 Uh...     
 Um...     
 She's got family in Canada, though, right?     
 So, when's she gonna let 'em know that she's here?     
 I'm working on it.     
 Look, everyone's timeline is different.     
 Let me know if you need anything.     
 Chives!     
 Not green onions.     
 [CLEARS THROAT]     
 [NICHOLE COOING]     
 DR. PHILLIPS: This is healing up nicely.     
 No swelling or discharge.     
 Any pain?     
 EMILY: Some.     
 DR. PHILLIPS: That should go away in time.     
 Cartilage doesn't heal as well as other tissue...     
 It's avascular.     
 Also, chondrocytes can't mobilize to damaged areas.     
 Right.     
 So you'll probably end up with a scar.     
 Uh, all your blood work came back normal.     
 CBC, glyco, metabolic.     
 Pelvic ultrasound and Pap look good, too.     
 Um, you do have some small uterine fibroids that we're gonna want to keep an eye on.     
 EMILY: Okay.     
 Follow-up appointments, uh, dental surgeon, optometrist, pulmonologist.     
 This is a referral to an OB/GYN for a consult on clitoral reconstruction when you're ready.     
 And Dr. Wilson is a terrific psychiatrist I want you to see now that you're transitioning out of acute care.     
 She does a lot of work with your community.     
 That's all?     
 DR. PHILLIPS: That's it.     
 I'll want to see you for physicals every other year.     
 And... uh, watch that cholesterol.     
 Cholesterol?     
 DR. PHILLIPS: Yeah, it's a little high for a woman your age.     
 You should be able to manage it with diet and exercise.     
 Okay.     
 Cora?     
 Do you have anything for burns?     
 [SCOFFS] Fantastic.     
 CORA: Look, she can't stay here.     
 BETH: She has to wait somewhere.     
 CORA: Not my problem.     
 I just get the passes!     
 [SIGHS DEEPLY]     
 [LOW OMINOUS MUSIC]     
 You're helping her escape?     
 Beth?     
 Yes.     
 We had to change pickup locations.     
 I can't take her to the new one until later when it is safe.     
 Why can't she stay here?     
 [SCOFFS] You're new, both of you.     
 You don't know how things work around here.     
 [FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING]     
 [DOOR OPENS]     
 Ooh.     
 Hen party.     
 Where's Mrs. Lawrence's tea?     
 It's coming right now, sir.     
 [CLICKING]     
 [BURNER IGNITES]     
 Who are you?     
 My name's Alison, sir.     
 Uh, she's come to help polish the silver for your meeting.     
 LAWRENCE: That's a lie.     
 You two...     
 ... are always finding friends.     
 I'll see if I can find a Guardian to take you home.     
 Or wherever.     
 Stay in this room.     
 [DOOR OPENS]     
 Commander Lawrence.     
 I don't like...     
 ... strangers in my house.     
 Why is there a stranger in my house?     
 [FLOOR CREAKS]     
 She's just here for a while.     
 Then she's gone.     
 Sir.     
 I asked you  why .     
 She's getting out.     
 She just needs a safe place to wait.     
 "She." "She."     
 You keep saying that... like it means something.     
 I don't know that person.     
 You helped me.     
 You don't know me.     
 Is that what you think?     
 That woman, those Marthas...     
 I know what their life is like.     
 She has a chance for something better.     
 Let her have it.     
 Okay.     
 [SCOFFS]     
 It's your funeral.     
 [HIGH PITCHED SOUND ESCALATING]     
 [KETTLE WHISTLING]     
 [WHISTLING DIES DOWN]     
 [FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING]     
 It's all right. She can stay.     
 [SIGHS]     
 What did you do?     
 I convinced him.     
 That must've been some blowjob.     
 Red Center Special.     
 I can take this.     
 Okay.     
 Just knock and leave it outside her door.     
 Mmm-hmm.     
 And thanks.     
 Close the door.     
 [CREEPY MUSIC]     
 BETH: We'll lose the opportunity.     
 Everything's already set up.     
 CORA: Forget it.     
 I'm not going with you.     
 BETH: If I walk back alone, I'm gonna get questioned.     
 CORA: Not my problem.     
 BETH: Cora!     
 OFJOSEPH: Lawrence is in the parlor.     
 He'll probably be there for a while.     
 We should go now.     
 I wanna see how it works.     
 We almost never move people.     
 Messages, black-market stuff, sometimes.     
 People are difficult.     
 Dangerous.     
 I've noticed. I can handle myself.     
 What? Were you in the military or something before?     
 No. Were you?     
 High school chemistry teacher.     
 Ah.     
 Well, I'm the only reason why you're not all in an interrogation room right now, so you owe me.     
 Come on,  Breaking Bad,  let's go.     
 Cora's not going.     
 So you need me.     
 I'm coming with you.     
 CORA: June.     
 I am not afraid of hard work.     
 All right.     
 But not like that.     
 [SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC]     
 [TRAIN WHISTLES IN THE DISTANCE]     
 [INDISTINCT RADIO CHATTER]     
 JUNE:  Strange to finally be invisible.   
 One of the reasons they chose red was the opposite.   
 We're easy to catch because we're easy to see.   
 Like blood on snow.   
 [OMINOUS MUSIC]     
 GUARDIAN  : Did you check her?     
 GUARDIAN  : Clear.     
 GUARDIAN  : Keep going.     
 [BEEPING]     
 GUARDIAN  : Straight line!     
 GUARDIAN  : No loitering!     
 GUARDIAN  : Straight line!     
 GUARDIAN  : Have your passes ready.     
 [SINISTER MUSIC]     
 [HEART BEEPING]     
 GUARDIAN  : Keep walking.     
 GUARDIAN  : Pass?     
 Step up.     
 GUARDIAN  : This pass is expired.     
 MARTHA: I did nothing wrong. I... I did nothing wrong.     
 - GUARDIAN  : Come with me. 
- MARTHA: I did nothing wrong.     
 GUARDIAN  : Move it!     
 Let's go!     
 [INDISTINCT CHATTER]     
 JUNE:  No Handmaids.   
 We're not allowed in this part of town.   
 Commercial laundries,   
 too many chemicals.   
 Gilead's green, but...   
 ... they still like their dry cleaning.   
 [HAMMER POUNDING METAL, CHAINSAW WHIRLING]     
 [LOADER BEEPING]     
 Shut the door.     
 [BREATHING HEAVILY]     
 BETH: Stay out of sight and keep quiet.     
 Someone'll come for you.     
 You can't wait with me?     
 BETH: We have to get back before we're missed.     
 God bless our labors.     
 Through work we're cleansed.     
 Good luck.     
 BETH: June, come on.     
 [OPENS DOOR] Let's go.     
 BETH: Sorry about what I said earlier.     
 You know, blowjob.     
 OFJOSEPH: I've heard worse.     
 BETH: Marthas are sinners, too, so we're told.     
 I had my tubes tied.     
 Lucky I can cook or I would've been upstairs at Jezebel's instead of in the kitchen.     
 Did you know Moira?     
 She called herself Ruby?     
 Yeah.     
 OFJOSEPH: She made it to Canada.     
 Alison's not going to Canada.     
 She's going deeper in.     
 A resistance cell out west somewhere.     
 She's valuable.     
 A chemistry teacher?     
 She makes bombs.     
 Like Ofglen.     
 Oh, so you know her work?     
 I guess you don't know what you're capable of     
 - till you have to do it. 
- [CAR APPROACHES]

 [INDISTINCT CHATTER]     
 [CHILDREN PLAYING AND LAUGHING]     
 BOY: Hey!     
 [BALL BOUNCING CLOSER]     
 Come on, boys.     
 Green onions would've worked in this, by the way.     
 Just the green part, and a little less.     
 All right, Chef Mansplainer.     
 It's delicious.     
 Thank you.     
 I hope you don't mind the fish.     
 I-I should've asked.     
 No, fish is great.     
 It turns out I have high cholesterol so...     
 Really?     
 EMILY: Yeah, all the meat and butter, I guess.     
 You know what helps with those arteries?     
 A little vino.     
 EMILY: Yeah, I never had that problem.     
 Before Gilead, I was a vegetarian.     
 Yeah, it's not like it matters.     
 You eat what they give you.     
 June was big on the fish.     
 And chicken.     
 And...     
 ... Meatless Mondays.     
 It was kinda pushy of her, huh?     
 I mean, she sets the menu, you do most of the cooking...     
 LUKE: No, I didn't mind.     
 What about, uh... [STUTTERING]     
 What about your wife?     
 She's, uh... She's a veggie or not?     
 MOIRA: Luke.     
 LUKE: What? I'm just...     
 I'm... I'm curious.     
 Because it can be hard, right?     
 You're trying to figure out how to raise your kid.     
 Do you... You know...     
 You know, could you please, uh, go get us some more potatoes?     
 Just, what, was it veggie or not for the kid?     
 Go get the f*cking potatoes.     
 [LUKE SMACKS HIS LIPS]     
 [UTENSILS RATTLE]     
 LUKE: [STUTTERING] You know... I...     
 [INHALES]     
 [SIGHS]     
 I... Sorry, excuse me.     
 [CLEARS THROAT]     
 There's, um, pie.     
 [DOOR CLOSES]     
 Apple.     
 [CLEARS THROAT]     
 I'm sorry.     
 MOIRA: Don't even.     
 That was all him.     
 [SNIFFS]     
 You know, he looks at you and he sees June.     
 He'd want her to call.     
 He looks at you, he's afraid she wouldn't.     
 Nah, she would.     
 She's a lot stronger than me.     
 Oh, I don't know about that.     
 I can't.     
 MOIRA: Yeah, because it's terrifying.     
 And you're right to be scared.     
 I mean, look...     
 I've seen a lot of these reunions and it's not always a storybook ending.     
 But nobody's talking about happily ever after.     
 Just after.     
 And he does make a great pie.     
 [LAUGHS, CLEARS THROAT]     
 Rita would never let me help.     
 BETH: Anything to get me to bed faster.     
 [OBJECTS CLATTER]     
 [SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC]     
 BETH: Alison!     
 sh1t! f*ck!     
 - OFJOSEPH: What happened? 
- [MARTHA WHIMPERING]     
 - CORA: Shh! Quiet! 
- ALISON: Guardians. They shot her.     
 - CORA: Did they follow you? 
- BETH: Get her to the basement.     
 OFJOSEPH: Come on!     
 - No, I don't think so. 
- [MARTHA WHIMPERING]     
 I'm sorry. Shh!     
 I didn't know where else to go.     
 Let's go!     
 - Shh! Come on! 
- [WHIMPERING]     
 Okay.     
 CORA: Towels are to the left.     
 Straight ahead. Go through there.     
 Let's go, let's go, let's go.     
 BETH: Okay.     
 Lay her down.     
 Okay. Okay.     
 [MARTHA WHIMPERING]     
 Thanks.     
 It's okay. She's just trying to stop the bleeding.     
 It's okay. Breathe. All right?     
 Is there anyone we can call?     
 I don't know. Uh, I'm trying to think.     
 - LAWRENCE: Cora? 
- BETH: sh1t.     
 LAWRENCE: Beth?     
 Okay. Shh.     
 - Put your hand here. 
- Okay.     
 [MARTHA BREATHING HEAVILY]     
 Okay, come on.     
 - Shh. 
- [MARTHA WHIMPERING IN PAIN]     
 
 
 
 LAWRENCE: What's going on?     
 Who's in the basement?     
 Just Beth.     
 We saw a rat.     
 She screamed.     
 Liar.     
 That's two.     
 - You wanna try? 
- [DOORBELL RINGS]     
 - Someone's hurt. 
- [BANGING ON DOOR]     
 Same someone who was here earlier?     
 Cora, get the door.     
 She's here, too.     
 There's another woman.     
 She's the one who's hurt, sir.     
 She screamed.     
 - Get her out. 
- Commander Lawrence...     
 LAWRENCE: You heard me. Get her out.     
 - CORA: Blessed evening. 
- GUARDIAN: Is the Commander home?     
 CORA: Yes. What's going on?     
 GUARDIAN: We need to speak with him.     
 CORA: Okay. I'll go get him for you.     
 GUARDIAN: Praise be.     
 Good evening, Commander Lawrence.     
 Sorry to disturb you.     
 LAWRENCE: Not at all. What's...     
 What's up?     
 GUARDIAN: Had a bit of trouble in town tonight.     
 A couple of fugitives.     
 Marthas.     
 LAWRENCE: Let's get you some coffee.     
 GUARDIAN: Thank you, sir.     
 We'll just be a minute.     
 We're talking to all the households in the area to see if you noticed anything amiss tonight.     
 We have a man doing a perimeter check     
 - of your property right now. 
- Joseph?     
 Is everything all right?     
 LAWRENCE: Everything's fine, my love.     
 Why don't you go back to bed?     
 When we have guests? Don't be silly.     
 Has he offered you something warm to drink?     
 GUARDIAN: Yes, ma'am. Thank you.     
 ELEANOR: Good.     
 Cold night like this.     
 Make yourself comfortable.     
 It'll just be a minute.     
 [INDISTINCT RADIO CHATTER]     
 Come help me, please.     
 Cora, can you please clean that up?     
 [FOOTSTEPS RECEDING]     
 Go.     
 BETH: Just breathe.     
 - [MARTHA GROANING] 
- BETH: It's okay. Breathe.     
 Shh... Shh...     
 What's going on?     
 OFJOSEPH: Guardians. We have to be quiet.     
 - How is she? 
- [MARTHA GASPING]     
 - BETH: Bad. 
- OFJOSEPH: Let me see.     
 There isn't a lot of bleeding.     
 She might have internal bleeding.     
 Please. Don't let me die.     
 No one's gonna let you die, okay?     
 Don't worry.     
 - Please don't let me die. 
- It's gonna be okay. I know.     
 It's gonna be okay. I need you to quiet.     
 ALISON: Shh... Breathe slowly.     
 Those Guardians can get an ambulance here in two minutes. We tell them...     
 - No. 
- ... we panicked and let them in.     
 - Christian charity. 
- You know we can't do that.     
 - They can save her! 
- They get her, she talks.     
 They get the entire network!     
 And they're gonna f*cking kill her anyways!     
 - GUARDIAN: Perimeter is looking clear! 
- sh1t!     
 [MARTHA CRYING]     
 sh1t!     
 Shh!     
 [INDISTINCT RADIO CHATTER]

 I need you to be quiet!     
 Listen to me!     
 Be quiet.     
 [MARTHA WHIMPERING]     
 [INDISTINCT RADIO CHATTER]     
 sh1t. Get down!     
 Come here. It's okay.     
 It's okay. It's okay!     
 [SHUSHING]     
 Shut up!     
 [MUFFLED CRYING]     
 [INDISTINCT CHATTER]     
 I'm sorry.     
 I'm sorry.     
 [MUFFLED WHIMPERING]     
 Okay. Okay.     
 Are you okay? Okay.     
 [HEAVY FOOTSTEPS UPSTAIRS]     
 [DOOR CLOSES]     
 I think they're gone.     
 Do you know where you're supposed to go next?     
 - ALISON: Yeah. 
- OFJOSEPH: Do you know how to get there?     
 ALISON: I think so.     
 OFJOSEPH: Is there a way out down here?     
 BETH: Yeah. Through there to the right.     
 Door leads to the backyard.     
 Go before Lawrence sees you.     
 [OFJOSEPH WEEPS]     
 OFJOSEPH: I need you to go.     
 - ALISON: I can't. 
- OFJOSEPH: Come on.     
 ALISON: I can go home. I'll go home.     
 OFJOSEPH: No. This place is not your home.     
 Listen to me.     
 I know you feel bad. We all do, but she knew what could happen.     
 We all did. Listen to me!     
 Do not let this be for nothing.     
 - Okay? 
- Okay.     
 Go. Hurry.     
 Godspeed. Okay.     
 BETH: This is why we don't move people.     
 [DOOR UNLOCKS]     
 [FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING]     
 Go see to Mrs. Lawrence.     
 I was wrong.     
 It's not your funeral after all.     
 Do you even know who she was?     
 OFJOSEPH: No, sir.     
 Women like you are like...     
 ... children.     
 Asking for too much, taking whatever you want.     
 Damn the consequences.     
 OFJOSEPH: I'm sorry, sir.     
 I bet you are.     
 Is Mrs. Lawrence okay?     
 Do not presume to speak to me about my wife!     
 I knew it was a mistake.     
 Sir, we had no idea she would come back here.     
 I mean taking you in.     
 Clean it up.

 Lawrence sent her away.     
 I don't know where.     
 [CLEARS THROAT] When they've healed,     
 I'll give you some butter.     
 It's what we use to keep 'em soft.     
 He doesn't like liars.

 Huh?     
 Whatever it is, it can't be bad as all that now.     
 Huh? Huh?     
 Mmm.     
 [BABY COOING]     
 You always got your sh1t together.     
 This...     
 Nichole, or us, or work...     
 ... Emily.     
 MOIRA: Yeah. Yeah, I totally got my sh1t together.     
 That's why I'm up all hours feeding this little monster,     
 huh?     
 [LUKE CHUCKLES]     
 I could be waking up next to somethin' pretty, hmm?     
 We're all f*cked up, okay?     
 Isn't that right?     
 [IN A SWEET VOICE] We're all f*cked up, right?     
 I remember when Hannah was this small.     
 Yeah.     
 Yeah.

 [MELANCHOLIC MUSIC]     
 'Cause...

 She had another job in mind for you.     
 [BELLS RING IN DISTANCE]

 HANDMAID: Blessed day.     
 OFMATTHEW: My mistress said she wasn't even a Martha from this district.     
 Guardians tracked her footprints through the Quinns' backyard but lost her trail at the creek.     
 It's like she vanished.     
 Like God carried her off.     
 Hardly.     
 A wicked old lady like that?     
 So ungrateful.     
 She had safety, and home, and purpose.     
 They should take an eye when they catch her.     
 Maybe her ears, too.     
 Did you hear Ofjohn died?     
 Yes.     
 Poor angel.     
 Traffic accident.     
 Her walking partner snapped.     
 Pushed her in front of a bus.     
 God rest her soul.
