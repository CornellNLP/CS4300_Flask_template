 Previously on The Handmaid's Tale  
  I think Offred was happy that the baby didn't come. 
  The doctor refuses to induce. 
  There's nothing we can do but wait. 
  I think the best way is the most natural way. 
  Stop! 
  Serena, no! 
  Please, stop! 
  Please, stop! 
  No, stop! 
  Don't do this! 
  I will not let you grow up in this place. 
  I promise you. 
  I've planned a surprise for you. 
  I think you'll like it. 
  Be back in three hours before Serena notices you're gone. 
  - Hannah! 
  - Mommy! 
  Hannah, come here, baby. 
  Come here, baby. 
  I need you to go now, okay? 
  What are you doing here? 
  I was just checking the Commander's house. 
  - Making sure it's clear. 
  - You're lying. 
  God! 
  I'm sorry there is so much pain in this story. 
  I'm sorry it's in fragments, like a body caught in crossfire or pulled apart by force. 
  But there's nothing I can do to change it. 
  I've tried to put some of the good things in as well. 
  There we go. 
  Good girl. 
  - Mommy. 
  - Okay, sweetheart. 
  I love you, okay? 
  Give me a hug. 
  Give me a hug. 
  Okay, you have a great day, okay, sweetie? 
  I love you and Mommy's gotta go now, okay? 
  No, no, no. 
  Yes, sweetheart. 
  Remember you had so much fun yesterday? 
  - No. 
  - Yeah, you did. 
  And you did those big drawings for Daddy and I, and you made friends - No. 
  - No? 
  Okay. 
  - Hi. 
  - Oh, look, there's Mrs. 
  Tanaka. 
  Hi. 
  - Hi. 
  - Hi. 
  Hi. 
  Sorry, we're having a little trouble today. 
  Aw, I know it's hard, but the minute you go, she'll be fine. 
  Believe me. 
  And it's important to stick to the routine. 
  - And you're doing Last Hug? 
  - I think so. 
  Okay. 
  So, you know it's time for Mom to leave. 
  Yeah. 
  Come on, sweetheart. 
  Mommy has to go, okay? 
  - Yeah. 
  - No. 
  - You can do it. 
  - Aw. 
  You're gonna have so much fun. 
  I'm sure you went through this with your own mother. 
  Yeah, not really. 
  Okay. 
  All right. 
  Have a great day. 
  I'm gonna miss you, and I love you. 
  You'll be fine, okay? 
  I know. 
  Wanna go see your friends? 
  - Go see your - No, no! 
  - Go ahead, sweetheart. 
  - Come here, Hannah. 
  - Take her hand. 
  - We're gonna have so much fun. 
  - Yeah! 
  - You'll have so much fun. 
  - It's okay, Hannah. 
  - It's all right. 
  It's okay. 
  Go ahead. 
  - It's okay. 
  I love you. 
  - Let's say bye to Mom! 
  - Have a great day! 
  - Mommy! 
  Bye, Banana. 
  - Ready? 
  - Mommy! 
  Flying! 
  You're gonna fly today! 
  - Mommy! 
  - Oh! 
  Fly up the stairs! 
  Radio Free America, broadcasting from somewhere in the Great White North. 
  And now, this news. 
  The American government in Anchorage today received promises of economic aid from India and China. 
  In the United Kingdom, additional sanctions on Gilead were announced as well as plans to raise the cap on American refugees relocating from Canada. 
  Now, a tune to remind everyone who's listening, American patriot or Gilead traitor: we are still here. 
  Stars and stripes forever, baby. 
  Got a wife and kids in Baltimore, Jack I went out for a ride and I never went back Like a river that don't know where it's flowing What do you think, baby? 
  I took a wrong turn and I just kept going Everybodys got a hungry heart Everybodys got a hungry heart f*ck it. 
  Oh, Roger's wife name is Patricia. 
  I think she does something at John Hancock. 
  Patricia. 
  Hancock. 
  What do you think? 
  Stripes or flowers? 
  - Huh? 
  - Stripes or flowers? 
  Uh, no tie. 
  - No? 
  - No. 
  It's a book release. 
  It's not a deposition. 
  - Controversial. 
  - Yeah. 
  I think, go for it. 
  - I like it. 
  - Go for it. 
  Oh, Lenore'll be there. 
  She's awesome. 
  Do you remember her from the Christmas party? 
  Mmm Mmm-hmm. 
  She apparently just started dating some guy from New York, so whatever you do, don't bring up baseball. 
  I think you'll be fine. 
  Okay. 
  Oh, my God. 
  What? 
  Just you. 
  - Yeah? 
  It's okay? 
  - No. 
  - You like that? 
  - Like it. 
  - Yeah? 
  - I like it, Momma. 
  Oh, yeah. 
  - This giant, giant belly? 
  - Mmm-hmm. 
  It's gonna get bigger, you know? 
  Right-size belly. 
  I'm ready for you. 
  I'm ready for you. 
  We're ready for you. 
  Momma, let's go. 
  We're gonna be late. 
  Okay, let's go. 
  Offred! 
  Commander Mackenzie? 
  Mrs. 
  Mackenzie? 
  Nick! 
  Offred? 
  Maybe they weren't here. 
  Oh, they were. 
  You saw the tire tracks outside. 
  Panicking is not gonna do us any good. 
  We'll go home, make a plan. 
  I'm not leaving here without my baby. 
  We shouldn't be here. 
  Someone might've seen our car. 
  I'll make some calls. 
  I'm sure Nick'll check in soon. 
  I told you they were here. 
  And they might still be here! 
  Fine. 
  We'll look. 
  But quickly. 
  If they've gone, we're only wasting time. 
  Offred! 
  Fred! 
  Fred! 
  Fred! 
  Fred! 
  "Maybe they weren't here"? 
  They were. 
  And now they've run off together, thanks to you! 
  There must be some other explanation. 
  Like what, Fred? 
  Nick wouldn't be disloyal. 
  I let Offred see her daughter. 
  She She would've been grateful. 
  How could you be so stupid? 
  They hate you! 
  She's always hated you! 
  She keeps running away from you! 
  Me? 
  If you'd shown that girl one ounce of kindness, she would never have left! 
  Kindness? 
  You raped her yesterday! 
  That was your idea! 
  I did this to fix your mess! 
  You sent her out here with the father of her baby to see her daughter? 
  What did you think was going to happen? 
  That she was going to go home and thank you? 
  You are such a f*cking idiot! 
  f*ck! 
  When did you become such a bitch? 
  What are we going to do? 
  We can't explain this away. 
  We can't even report it. 
  To have a pregnant Handmaid run away once is bad enough! 
  But twice! 
  They'll say we're part of the Resistance! 
  I'll handle it. 
  You'll handle it. 
  Just like you handled this? 
  They'll put us on the Wall! 
  Yeah? 
  Maybe they'll hang us side by side. 
  Just my f*cking luck. 
  That's just great. 
  Make jokes, Fred. 
  I gave up everything for you. 
  And for the cause. 
  And I only ever wanted one thing in return. 
  I wanted a baby. 
  You wanted a lot more than that. 
  f*cking demanded it. 
  I only ever wanted a baby. 
  And because of your sick infatuation with that girl and your stupid obsession with her Don't you dare! 
  Don't, don't Can you give it a rest for a second! 
  I'm trying to think! 
  I have nothing. 
  You've left me with nothing. 
  You've left me with nothing. 
  I have nothing. 
  I have I have nothing. 
  I will never hold my baby. 
  Serena. 
  Serena. 
  Get away from Get away! 
  You listen to me. 
  Listen to me! 
  Listen. 
  It'll be all right. 
  I'll call the local Security. 
  They can't have gotten far. 
  But we need to go. 
  We need to go. 
  I went into labor in the middle of performing a uterine myomectomy. 
  I finished the procedure, I closed, - and had 20 more hours of labor. 
  - Mmm-hmm. 
  Whoa. 
  I bet doctors get the best drugs. 
  You had, like, three epidurals, didn't you? 
  No, I was unmedicated. 
  I wanted to know what it feels like. 
 
 
 
  - Seriously? 
  - Oh! 
  Oh, my God. 
  I don't know. 
  I think I'll just feel safer in a hospital. 
  Safer? 
  Should I name all the superbugs that you can catch in those places? 
  But you work in a hospital. 
  Yeah, so I know. 
  The staff here are licensed and fully qualified. 
  I went to school with the medical director. 
  It's just, it's not me. 
  I want doctors and nurses and lots of drugs and You are stronger than you think. 
  Mom, you're not even going to be there, so what do you care? 
  What are you talking about? 
  Of course, I'll be there. 
  Look, I know you and I know your work is important to you and And, what, I think it's more important than you? 
  Just don't make promises you can't keep. 
  Okay?

  Hi. 
  Hello there. 
  Hello. 
  Hello. 
  Hi, baby. 
  Hi. 
  Oh, sweet girl. 
  Baby girl. 
  Oh, Mom. 
  It was shitty weather in Atlanta and the flight was delayed. 
  Hey, Dad. 
  Oh, sweetheart, you did it. 
  I did it. 
  This is Hannah. 
  Oh, hello sweet Hannah. 
  Hannah, this is your grandmother. 
  Holly. 
  - You did it, baby. 
  - We did it. 
  Holly. 
  Your name is Holly. 
  You have a big sister. 
  Her name is Hannah. 
  And, one day, you're gonna meet her. 
  I keep going with this limping and mutilated story because I want you to hear it. 
  As I will hear yours, too if I ever get the chance, if I meet you or if you escape, in the future or in heaven. 
  By telling you anything at all, I'm believing in you. 
  I believe you into being. 
  Because I'm telling you this story, I will your existence. 
  I tell. 
  Therefore, you are. 
  We did it, Holly.
