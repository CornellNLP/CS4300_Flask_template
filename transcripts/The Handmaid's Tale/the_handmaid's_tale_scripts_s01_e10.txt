 OFFRED:  Previously on The Handmaid's Tale...   
 - We need you. The baby needs you. 
- You lying f*ck!   
 You promised me we would run off and we would be a family!   
 Janine, change is coming. There's hope.   
 AUNT LYDIA:  May the Lord keep you in His mercy.   
 You stupid girl.   
 SERENA JOY:  Hopefully, he'll only receive an admonishment.   
 It's not going to be easy without your husband.   
 Why don't you worry about your own husband?    
 OFFRED: They need you to go back to Jezebel's.    
 They've been trying to get a package out of there.    
 Hide it until someone contacts you.    
 This is f*cking ridiculous. Risking your life because Alma said so?    
 - f*ckin' Alma? 
- It's just a package.    
 It could be anything! A bomb. Anthrax. What do you know?    
 What is wrong with you?    
 Do not let them grind you down.    
 You keep your f*cking sh1t together. You fight!   
 MAN: Saved it for you. Special.    
 (ENGINE STARTS)    
 (CHOIR SINGING HYMN IN DISTANCE)    
 All right. Single line, please.    
 Boy, look at these outfits. 
It's a parade of sluts.    
 Take your hands out of your pocket.    
 - (DOOR OPENS) 
- Did I say run, you in the vest?    
 Semicircle!    
 Equidistant.    
 Hands clasped.    
 Eyes down, girls.    
 (DOOR CLANKS OPEN)    
 OFFRED:  There was a way we looked at each other at the Red Center.   
 For a long time I couldn't figure out what it was exactly.   
 That expression in their eyes.   
 In my eyes.   
 Because before, in real life,   
 you didn't ever see it.   
 Not more than a glimpse.   
 It was never something that could last for days.   
 It could never last for years.   
 (SHRIEKS IN PAIN)    
 Step forward.    
 (WHIMPERS)    
 Humble yourselves in the sight of the Lord and He shall lift you up.    
 How do we humble ourselves?    
 Wonderful.    
 I believe an apology would be respectful as well.    
 (SOFTLY) Sorry.    
 Aunt Lydia.    
 I'm sorry, Aunt Lydia.    
 - I'm sorry, Aunt Ly... 
- Lydia.    
 - (NERVOUSLY) I'm sorry, Aunt Lydia. 
- Ah, very good.    
 (DOOR CLANKS OPEN)    
 (SOFTLY) Come along.    
 (TENSE MUSIC PLAYING)    
 Please.    
 (CLICKING)    
 (ELECTRONIC WHIRRING)    
 This will be painful, I am sorry to say.    
 But you are so very precious, we wouldn't want to lose you.    
 AUNT LYDIA: Keep still now.    
 OFFRED:  That look was terror.   
 Utter and unutterable.   
 It tastes like gunmetal.   
 Like the point of a carpenter's nail.   
 Would you like a one-two-three, dear?    
 - One...

 (BREATHING HEAVILY) 
(HIGH-PITCHED RINGING)    
 (GASPING)    
 (CRIES SOFTLY)    
 (DOOR OPENS)    
 OFFRED:  We don't look at each other that way anymore.   
 (SOFT MUSIC PLAYING)    
 (INDISTINCT RADIO CHATTER)    
 It's their own fault.   
 They should have never given us uniforms if they didn't want us to be an army.   
 Praised be.    
 (METAL CLANKS)    
 (THUD)    
 I trusted you. I tried to help you.    
 You don't have anything to say for yourself?    
 (BREATHING HEAVILY)    
 (GROANS)    
 - I don't know. 
- You don't know?    
 (BREATHING HEAVILY)    
 You could have left me with something.    
 I'm sorry, Mrs. Waterford.    
 Get up! Get up!    
 Sit down!    
 Sit on it.    
 (CLATTERING)    
 - I don't think I can. 
- Don't be a child!    
 (URINATING)    
 Now get on your knees and pray that God makes you worthy in some way.    
 (DOOR CLOSES)    
 (SNIFFLES)    
 (EXHALES DEEPLY)    
 (SOBS)    
 (DOOR OPENS)     
 Praised be His mercy.     
 He's answered our prayers.     
 You think I prayed for this?     
 You think I prayed to bring a baby into this house?     
 God knows what's in your heart.     
 Get some rest.     
 (DOOR CLOSES)

 ("SWAN LAKE" BY TCHAIKOVSKY)     
 - (JUNE LAUGHING) 
- (LUKE SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY)     
 LUKE:  Ooh, she's a fighter.   
 - She's a fighter like Mommy. 
- Right? She's strong.     
 - Oh, my gosh. 
- You think that's a fist or a foot?     
 It's like a Serena Williams.     
 - We're gonna have a tennis player. 
- Yeah?     
 (CHUCKLES)     
 - She'll make us millions. 
- I was just thinking that.     
 - We'll be able to retire. 
- So much money.     
 (BOTH LAUGH)     
 (CLOCK CHIMING)     
 (CLOCK TICKING)     
 WATERFORD: Is everything all right?     
 Then can you please, Serena?     
 I have a conference call in five minutes.     
 They arrested three more Marthas in the West End.     
 They were planning some kind of attack.     
 (SCOFFS) Don't these people ever give up?     
 I forget, how many tiles do you pick to start?     
 Seven.     
 - Do you want to play? 
- Love to. But I have work to do.     
 - And, in any case, you know the law. 
- Yes, I do.     
 I helped write it.     
 I remember.     
 She's a smart girl.     
 I imagine that she's pretty good at this.     
 We'll talk about this another time.     
 She left makeup on the collar of my cloak.     
 Is that how you got her past the checkpoints?     
 You need to keep your hands off of her.     
 I will not have her hanging from a ceiling or stepping in front of a truck.     
 Do you understand me, Fred?     
 You're going to control yourself.     
 Control myself.     
 You brought lust and temptation back into this house.     
 On your back, and on your knees.     
 If I've sinned, then you led me to it.     
 You can blame me all you want, but He knows the truth.     
 Everybody answers to God.     
 And you answer to me.     
 - Go to your room. 
- She's pregnant.     
 Praised be.     
 Praised be.     
 It isn't yours.     
 You're weak, and God would never let you pass on that weakness.     
 You can't father a child because you're not worthy.     
 (CRASHES)     
 Blessed day.     
 Your breakfast is ready. 
It's eggs and oatmeal.     
 - Or I can make you something else. 
- No, it's fine. Thank you.     
 God bless you.     
 Are you feeling okay?     
 Yeah, I'm okay. Thank you.     
 Good. Praised be.     
 - SERENA JOY: Rita! 
- Yes, ma'am.     
 Sit down.     
 What happened?     
 She found out.     
 About the Commander.     
 You okay?     
 I'm pregnant.     
 What?     
 She had a test.     
 It must have been from the black market or something.     
 Don't.     
 Please.     
 It's terrible.     
 No, it's not.     
 (SOFT MUSIC PLAYING)     
 Offred, get your cloak, please.     
 You need the car?     
 No. Thank you, Nick.     
 I've made other arrangements.     
 We have a long drive ahead, so get comfortable.     
 And don't touch the curtains.     
 (DOG BARKING)     
 MAN: Hey, check this out.     
 (DISTANT LAUGHTER)     
 (LAUGHING)     
 (COUGHS)     
 (TENSE MUSIC PLAYING)     
 We're here, ma'am.     
 Where are we, Mrs. Waterford?     
 Thank you.     
 Mrs. Waterford. Where are we?     
 - She stays in the car. 
- MATTHEW: Yes, ma'am.     
 (TENSE MUSIC PLAYING)     
 (KNOCKS) Please! Please, let me out.     
 Please, let me out! That's my daughter!     
 No! Let me out!

 No! Let me out! Please, let me out!     
 No! Hannah!     
 Hannah!     
 (SOBBING)     
 (KNOCKS) Let me out.     
 Let me out! Let me out!

 Please! Please!     
 Please, Mrs. Waterford, please!     
 Please, let me out.     
 Please! Please, Mrs. Waterford, please.     
 You can drive now.     
 Please let me see her! Let me out.     
 I'm begging you. I'm begging you.     
 Please, please. No! No!     
 No!     
 Offred, you need to listen to me.     
 Please, please, take me back. 
Please! I have to see her, please!     
 That's not going to be good for anybody.     
 She is a beautiful girl, Offred.     
 And she's happy and she's well taken care of.     
 And you don't have to worry about anything.     
 Listen to me.     
 As long as my baby is safe, so is yours.     
 No, please.     
 No, please. (SOBS)     
 Please, please.     
 Please, I'm begging you.     
 Please, please!     
 Please, Mrs. Waterford. Please. Please!     
 What is wrong with you?     
 What is wrong with you?     
 (BREATHING HEAVILY)     
 How can you do this?     
 You're deranged.     
 You're... You're... You're f*cking evil.     
 You know that?     
 You are a goddamn motherfucking monster!     
 f*cking heartless, sadistic, motherfucking evil c**t!     
 f*ck you, Serena!     
 You are gonna burn in goddamn motherfucking hell, you crazy, evil bitch!     
 Don't get upset.     
 That's not good for the baby.     
 No!     
 Furthermore, I, Warren Putnam, did knowingly engage in the sin of lust and covetousness.     
 And by doing so, I rent the sacred covenant that exists between myself and my country, my brothers, and God Almighty.     
 I offer myself humbly to His judgment, as spoken through this council.     
 Body and soul shall I give to thee.     
 Thank you, Commander Putnam.     
 Go in grace.     
 Under His eye.     
 PRYCE: Thoughts, gentlemen?     
 He seems genuinely remorseful.     
 And he's a strong defender of the faith.     
 Shall we have a voice vote?     
 Commander, this is a serious offense.     
 Of course.     
 But who amongst us hasn't made mistakes?     
 And who amongst us doesn't have an afternoon of work piling up as we sit here?     
 Commander Waterford, we're all very busy men.     
 But are we too busy to stand against sin?     
 Of course not.     
 Good.     
 Then we should discuss next steps.     
 And we should remember Commander Putnam has a family, a wife and a new child.     
 Yes. She came to me herself to testify for her husband.     
 Yes, what we decide here will affect innocent people.     
 She came to ask for the harshest possible punishment.     
 She fears for his immortal soul.     
 She knows that he must make an offering to God to find redemption.     
 She loves her husband...     
 Very much.

 WATERFORD: Well, this is a nice surprise.     
 I've had quite a day.     
 How about you?     
 I need your help.     
 Of course.     
 I need you to...     
 Protect my daughter.     
 Please.     
 Protect her from what?     
 From her.     
 From Mrs. Waterford.     
 I'm sure you don't have anything to worry about.     
 Mrs. Waterford would never hurt a child.     
 You don't know her.     
 I hear congratulations are in order.     
 Hmm.     
 Hmm, yes.     
 Praised be.     
 Such wonderful news. A miracle, really.

 I want to apologize.     
 I said some cruel things to you and I'm very sorry.

 He is faithful and just to forgive us for our sins.     
 Don't do that.     
 Listen, I know we've been through a lot...     
 But look where we are.     
 Where are we, Fred?     
 We're going to have a baby.     
 We're bringing a new life into this world.     
 Yes.

 Yes, Aunt Lydia.     
 Yes.   
 There is no greater miracle than the miracle of life.   
 The miracle of a child.   
 And there is no greater sin than harming a child.   
 Putting a child in danger.

 Yes, Aunt Lydia.

 But I don't know what I'm waiting for.   
 My punishment, I suppose.   
 We said no.   
 We refused to do our duty.   
 To kill Janine.   
 And for that sin we will be punished.   
 I have no doubt.   
 I am in disgrace.   
 Which is the opposite of grace.   
 I ought to be terrified.   
 But I feel serene.   
 And there's a kind of hope, it seems,   
 even in futility.

 WATERFORD: Do you have a warrant?     
 MAN: Everything is in order.     
 After everything we've done for you.     
 OFFRED:  Whether this is my end or a new beginning,   
 I have no way of knowing.   
 I have given myself over into the hands of strangers.   
 I have no choice.   
 It can't be helped.   
 And so I step up,   
 into the darkness within...   
 Or else the light.   
 (♪ "AMERICAN GIRL" BY TOM PETTY)
