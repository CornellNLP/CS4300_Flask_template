 NARRATOR:  Previously on The Handmaid's Tale...   
 Hello there.   
 Did you try to find me? 
I waited for you.   
 I know. And I'm so sorry I couldn't be there for you.   
 - Hannah. 
- Her name is Agnes now.   
 It's okay. I have new parents, now.   
 Hey, Waterford! Waterford, you f*cking piece of sh1t!    
 - And, you are? 
- Luke Bankole.    
 You're gonna remember my face 'cause I'm gonna remember yours.    
 He's a serial rapist!    
 You're not gonna do anything about it.    
 There's protests planned. I encourage you to speak out.    
 - Not Ruby, asshole. 
- [PROTESTERS SHOUTING INDISTINCTLY]    
 [BABY CRIES]    
 SERENA: She has no contact with the baby.    
 And she pumps in her room.    
 You cannot give up. You're gonna see your son again.    
 - I'm not his mother anymore. 
- Of course, you are.    
 At least your son is in Canada. He's free! With your wife!    
 Commander Lawrence is a very brilliant, very important man.    
 He is considered the architect of Gilead's economy.    
 I'm wondering why such an important, brilliant man would take in such a shitty Handmaid.    
 [GASPS]    
 He did something terrible.    
 The Colonies! He came up with the whole thing.    
 You are such a f*cking idiot.    
 When did you become such a  bitch ?    
 It is our duty to ensure that the children of Gilead live by the laws of Scripture, and our sons and daughters should be taught to read it.    
 Fred! Stop! Stop it!    
 I tried.    
 We value privacy in this house. Do you understand?    
 God has called me to a higher purpose.    
 [GASPS]    
 [SCREAMS]    
 You don't believe that?    
 I will not let you grow up in this place.    
 I'm gonna get you out of here. I promise.    
 We can get you out.    
 You and the baby, but you have to go right now!    
 - Who's "we"? 
- Friends.    
 Martha's. Go! Go!    
 [BREATHING HEAVILY]    
 My child is missing!    
 It's too dangerous out there. We'll stay here.    
 Listen to me! She cannot grow up here.

 [WEEPING]    
 Holly, this is your sister.    
 You're gonna meet her one day.    
 Emily?    
 EMILY: What is happening?    
 I'm getting myself in deep sh1t.    
 You're getting out of Gilead.    
 LAWRENCE: Don't get caught!    
 [BABY COOING]    
 Call her Nichole.    
 EMILY: June!    
 - Please don't take her! No! 
- Mommy!    
 [ECHOING] Mommy!    
 [SOBS]    
 HANNAH: [ECHOING] Mommy?    
 [SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC]    
 JUNE:  Please, God, watch over her.   
 Protect her.   
 Because this isn't the place   
 with the still waters and green pastures,   
 if you haven't noticed.   
 This is the valley of death.   
 And there's a f*ck‐ton of evil to fear.   
 Please.   
 Get her the hell out of here.

 [JUNE BREATHING HEAVILY]    
 If she gets out, will she remember me?   
 Will she know that I gave her away?   
 I have reasons.   
 There are always reasons.   
 I'm sorry, baby girl.   
 Mom's got work.

 LAWRENCE: Are you insane?    
 You didn't get in the truck.    
 Thoughts?    
 Now, get in the car.    
 We can catch 'em before they cross the border.    
 Come on.     
 Do you know Commander Mackenzie?     
 He has a daughter.     
 Her name is Agnes.     
 I need you to take me there, and then we can head north.     
 A daughter?     
 I can't leave without her.     
 You can.     
 I won't.     
 You helped Emily.     
 I liked Emily.     
 They could put you on the wall.     
 Even a Commander.     
 Spunky.     
 I'll take you to Mackenzie.

 NICK: Mrs. Waterford?     
 Serena, praised be.     
 Everyone has lost their minds.     
 Go to my office.     
 Call    .     
 Let her pass, son.     
 This has gone far enough.     
 We should give her more time...     
 To get away.     
 What did you do?     
 I did what was best for my child.

 MRS. MACKENZIE: Please.     
 This has to stop.     
 You brought our child into the world.     
 The Commander and I bless you for that, God knows.     
 She had nightmares for weeks after the summer house.     
 [SCOFFS]     
 Of course, she told me.     
 I'm her mother.     
 You're being cruel. Confusing her like this.     
 I'm confusing her?     
 MRS. MACKENZIE: Take her home.     
 What's she like?     
 She's very happy.     
 She's a healthy, blessed child.     
 She's thriving.     
 Jonathan.     
 She's fine.     
 She's amazing.     
 She likes to sew,     
 but she's not very good at it.     
 Bless her efforts.     
 She's actually quite a good cook.     
 Luke cooks.     
 Her father.     
 He's good at it, too.     
 She wants a dog.     
 OFFRED: Oh.     
 She's allergic.     
 She says she'll get the shots.     
 [CHUCKLES]     
 She won't stick to it.     
 MRS. MACKENZIE: No.     
 She hates shots.     
 MRS. MACKENZIE: Yeah. Maybe, a Goldendoodle.     
 I don't know.     
 Something hypoallergenic.     
 Yeah.     
 The Commander doesn't love the idea, but she's working on him.     
 She's very good at that.     
 [LAUGHS]     
 Yeah.     
 I appreciate the home you've made for her.     
 Thank you.     
 Please, stop.     
 You know all of this ends with you dying on the ground in front of her.     
 If you love her, you have to stop.

 Where is she?     
 Do me the courtesy of looking at me when I'm talking to you!     
 Where is she?     
 You've killed us all, you realize.     
 When they find out what happened here, we'll all be on the wall!     
 And they will tear you apart!     
 She's safe, Serena.     
 Serena, I promise you, she is safe.     
 I'll know she's safe when you tell me where she is.     
 Where is she?     
 I'm trying to save your life.     
 SERENA: Did you give her to Ofjoseph?     
 I did what was best for her, Serena.     
 Did you give my baby to Ofjoseph?     
 You wanted a better life for her, and that is what a mother does for her child.     
 You gave her to a murderer!     
 You killed my baby!     
 You've killed my baby!     
 How could you take her away from me?     
 'Cause I  have  another daughter!     
 You  chased us in the woods, and  you  hunted us down with dogs.     
 And when you pulled her away, she  screamed !     
 My baby  screamed for  her  mother!     
 And I hope this feels like that!

 There won't be another chance, do you know that?     
 You're never getting out.

 It's the only way to keep you off the wall.     
 You don't need to protect me.
