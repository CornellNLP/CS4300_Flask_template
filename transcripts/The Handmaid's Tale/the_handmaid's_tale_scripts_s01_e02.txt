 Run, run, run! Run, run!   
 OFFRED: Previously on The Handmaid's Tale...   
 - GUARDIAN  : We got her! 
- JUNE: No!   
 HANNAH: Mommy!   
 This is the new one.   
 I'm Commander Waterford.   
 May God make me truly worthy.   
 SERENA JOY: He is my husband.   
 Don't get any ideas.    
 Fertility is a gift directly from God.    
 You girls will serve the Leaders of the Faithful    
 and their barren wives.   
 You will bear children for them.   
 Welcome to the friggin' loony bin.    
 Blessed are the meek, dear.    
 OFFRED:  What'd they do to her?   
 "If my right eye offends thee, pluck it out."    
 OFFRED:  He's the Commander's driver.   
 Maybe he watches me.   
 There's an Eye in your house.    
 Be careful.   
 OFFRED:  My name is June.   
 I intend to survive.   
 OFFRED:  Blue.   
 I let it take me.   
 Blue Moon.    
 Rhapsody in Blue.    
 Tangled Up in Blue.    
 Blue Oyster Cult.   
 Blue Monday.    
 Our car was that color.   
 We bought it off Craigslist.   
 It smelled like maple syrup.   
 Luke said it was a leak in the radiator,   
 it was probably bad for kids.   
 After we got it fixed, I missed that smell.   
 And so did Hannah.   
 She said it smelled like Saturdays.   
 (HANNAH LAUGHING)    
 (COUGHS)    
 (BED CREAKING)    
 I wish he'd hurry the f*ck up.   
 (COMMANDER GRUNTS SOFTLY)    
 (INDISTINCT VOICES ON WALKIE-TALKIE)    
 (GATE CREAKS)    
 Hi.    
 Blessed be the fruit.    
 (INDISTINCT VOICES ON WALKIE-TALKIE)    
 May the Lord open.    
 (INDISTINCT VOICES ON WALKIE-TALKIE)    
 We should go. It's gonna pour.    
 Would you like to take the long way?    
 You're going to get caught in the rain.    
 I like the rain.    
 Okay, whatever.    
 We're going home.    
 - Under His eye. 
- BOTH: Under His eye.    
 Do you think it's safe to talk here?    
 If we're careful.    
 Are you from here?    
 Brookline. You?    
 Missoula, Montana, if you can believe that.    
 I moved here for school.    
 Do you work in the city? Or did you?    
 OFFRED: I was an assistant book editor.    
 After my daughter Hannah was born,    
 it was part-time but sometimes it was just paperwork.    
 But we did novels and academic titles.    
 Once we did nine volumes on the history of falconry.    
 Oh, man.    
 Actually, that sounds like it'd be fun to me right now.    
 Yeah, it kind of sounds amazing.    
 OFGLEN: I worked at the university.    
 Lecturer in cellular biology.    
 OFFRED: Wow.    
 I thought all the college professors    
 were sent to The Colonies or...    
 I have two good ovaries.    
 So they were kind enough to overlook my sinful past.    
 Lucky me.    
 (BUILDING CREAKING)    
 (THUDDING)    
 (DRILLING)    
 OFFRED: St. Paul's.    
 That was my dad's parish.    
 My daughter was baptized there.    
 They took down St. Patrick's in New York City.    
 Blew it up and dumped every stone in the Hudson River.    
 They f*cking erased it.    
 (THUDDING AND RUMBLING)    
 And how do you know that?    
 How do you know there's an Eye in my house?    
 (MAN SHOUTS INDISTINCTLY)    
 (INDISTINCT SHOUTING)    
 It's okay.    
 To be relieved it wasn't you.    
 It was someone.    
 I know.     
 There's a way to help them.     
 You can join us.     
 What do you mean "us"?     
 There's a network.     
 I don't know. 
I'm not that kind of person.     
 No one is until they have to be.     
 Waterford is important. He's very high up.     
 You should find out and tell us.     
 - Find out what? 
- Find out anything.     
 - Don't say a word. 
- Of course I won't.     
 OFFRED:  There is an "us"?   
 It seems imagined, like secrets in the fifth grade.   
 People with mysterious histories and dark linkages.   
 It doesn't seem as if it should be the true shape of the world.   
 That's a hangover from an extinct reality.   
 Now, the Guardians of the Faithful   
 and American soldiers still fight with tanks   
 in the remains of Chicago.   
 Now, Anchorage is the capital   
 of what's left of the United States,   
 and the flag that flies over that city   
 has only two stars.   
 Now, darkness and secrets are everywhere.   
 Now, there has to be an "us."   
 Because, now, there is a "them."   
 Get caught in the rain?     
 Yes.     
 You were gone a while.     
 Sometimes we walk home along by the river.     
 You need to be careful.     
 By the river?     
 With her. Ofglen.     
 She's my partner. We shop together.     
 Don't get too close to her. 
It's dangerous.     
 He wants to see you.     
 Who?     
 The Commander.     
 Tonight, in his office.     
 Why?     
  :  . Don't be late.     
 OFFRED:  It's forbidden for us to be alone   
 with the Commanders.   
 We aren't concubines. We're two-legged wombs.   
 Maybe he knows about Ofglen.   
 Have I been invited to my own ending?   
 No.   
 'Cause it isn't an invitation.   
 I can't send my regrets.   
 (BIRTHMOBILE SIREN BLARING)     
 RITA: Offred!     
 (FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING)     
 (SIREN CONTINUES WAILING)     
 RITA: It's the birthmobile.     
 Hurry. They won't wait all day.     
 I've got it.     
 Thank you.     
 I'll pray for good news.     
 (INDISTINCT VOICES ON WALKIE-TALKIE)     
 HANDMAID  : Everything will be fine.     
 HANDMAID  : It will. 
It's going to be good.     
 It's wonderful, isn't it? Wonderful?     
 Who is it?     
 Ofwarren. Praised be.     
 OFFRED:  One-eyed bat-shit-crazy Janine.   
 What will she give birth to?   
 An Unbaby, with a pinhead   
 or a snout like a dog's   
 or no heart?   
 The chances for a healthy birth are one in five,   
 if you can get pregnant at all.   
 (POP MUSIC PLAYING ON RADIO)     
 (PANTING)     
 You all right?     
 - f*ck! 
- It's all right.     
 We're almost there.     
 (GROANS)     
 Okay, here we are.     
 (MUTTERING PRAYERS)     
 (POLICE SIREN WAILING)     
 (MURMURING CONTINUES)     
 LUKE: It's all right.     
 Hi. Yeah. Can we get some help?     
 (SIREN BLARING)     
 (BIRTHMOBILE SIREN BLARING)     
 (HANDMAIDS MURMURING)     
 (SIGHS)     
 There's real coffee, can you smell it?     
 We do the work and then they pig out.     
 (NAOMI MOANING)     
 WIFE  : It's okay.     
 - Breathe, breathe. 
- There you go.     
 Breathe.     
 - SERENA JOY: You're doing so great. 
- (NAOMI GROANING)     
 - WIFE  : Really wonderful. 
- Thank you.     
 (GROANS)     
 NAOMI: It hurts.     
 (WIVES MURMURING)     
 - WIFE  : Such a special day. 
- WIFE  : Such a blessed day.     
 WIVES: Breathe.     
 WIVES: Breathe.     
 - WIFE  : We are right here with you. 
- WIFE  : Breathe.     
 WIVES: Breathe.     
 Breathe.     
 - (ALL MURMURING) 
- Breathe.     
 WIFE  : She's been doing so well. So well.     
 WIFE  : Let's close our eyes.     
 WIFE  : Mmm, this coffee. 
It's delicious.     
 WIFE  : Yes. Yes, it's okay.     
 WIVES: Breathe.     
 Breathe.     
 HANDMAIDS: Hold. Hold. Hold.     
 AUNT LYDIA: And again, girls.     
 OFFRED:  There's a smell coming from that room.   
 Something primal.   
 It's the smell of dens.   
 - HANDMAIDS: Hold. Hold. Hold. 
- OFFRED:  Of inhabited caves.   
 It's the smell of the plaid blanket on the bed.   
 Where the cat gave birth, once, before she was spayed.   
 ALL: Breathe, breathe.     
 OFFRED:  It's the smell of genesis.   
 ALL: Hold. Hold. Hold.     
 ALL: Exhale, exhale, exhale.     
 Breathe, breathe, breathe.     
 And hold, hold, hold.     
 Exhale,     
 exhale,     
 exhale.     
 - Breathe, breathe, breathe. 
- Hey.     
 ALL: And hold, hold...     
 You're doing great.     
 Hold.     
 ALL: Exhale, exhale, exhale.     
 (HANNAH COOING)     
 Mmm.     
 You smell so good.     
 You do.     
 Hi, Hannah.     
 Hi.     
 Hello there. You looking around?     
 (LUKE SNORING)     
 Is Daddy keeping you awake?     
 (SNORING)     
 TANIA: Hey, Mom.     
 - Hi. 
- How we doing?     
 Very good, I think.     
 Hey, will the doctor call me when the tests come back?     
 Oh, the lab just sent them up.     
 All normal.     
 Genetic screening and cardiac tests are perfect.     
 She is a healthy little girl.     
 Oh, yes, she is. Thank God.     
 Praised be.     
 - JUNE: Yes, she is. 
- TANIA: Got it.     
 JUNE: Don't lose that.     
 Don't lose that.     
 - Ooh, hello. 
- Someone's gonna take their first bath.     
 Yes.     
 (SNORING)     
 TANIA: Oh, here we are.     
 Here we are, Hannah.     
 - Bath time. 
- Ooh.     
 (TANIA GIGGLES)     
 Where are the babies?     
 Oh, we had a difficult night.     
 Two went to the intensive care unit.     
 And the others are with God.     
 NAOMI:  Oh, it hurts!   
 WIVES: Breathe, breathe.     
 Breathe.     
 Should I wash these?     
 MARTHA: No, the mistress is particular.     
 Just set them on the counter.     
 - Thanks. 
- All right.     
 WIVES: Breathe, breathe.     
 It's so crowded up there.     
 At least someone spiked the juice.     
 You okay?     
 He wants to see me, alone.     
 Your commander?     
 sh1t.     
 You don't know why?     
 No.     
 Maybe he did this with the one before you.     
 Maybe she told someone about it.     
 Let me see what I can find out.     
 It's too dangerous.     
 It'll be okay.     
 I'm sneaky.     
 SERENA JOY: What are you doing?     
 I'm just helping, Mrs. Waterford.     
 Well, leave it.     
 Come with me.     
 Offred, what's going on up there?     
 Her contractions are getting much closer together.     
 (SIGHS) It's taking forever.     
 Is it breech, dear?     
 Did you hear that word?     
 No, ma'am.     
 LEAH: Oh, well, we'll have to be patient then, won't we?     
 Yes, ma'am.     
 Would you like a cookie, dear?     
 CAROLINE: You shouldn't spoil them. Sugar is bad for them.     
 LEAH: Oh, surely one won't hurt.     
 It is a special day.     
 Offred, would you like a cookie?     
 Yes, please.     
 Thank you.     
 Here you are.     
 Oh, isn't she well behaved?     
 You can go.     
 CAROLINE: (SCOFFS) Little whores, all of them.     
 SERENA JOY: But still, you can't be choosy.     
 You have to take what they hand out.     
 (DOOR CLOSES)     
 (BREATHING HEAVILY)     
 (WATER RUNNING)     
 ALL: Breathe, breathe, breathe...     
 AUNT LYDIA: Girls! Energy!     
 - Let Him feel your devotion...

 And we will be rewarded.     
 ALL: Hold, hold, hold.     
 Exhale, exhale, exhale.     
 (JANINE GROANS)     
 AUNT LYDIA: Good girl, Ofwarren. Good girl.     
 You are doing so well.     
 - We are so proud of you. 
- (GROANS)     
 No, I'm, uh, I'm fine. I need to walk.     
 Stretch your legs a bit.     
 Girls, come on, now. Help her.     
 Help her now.     
 (GROANING)     
 (SCREAMS)     
 Get her to the chair.     
 Tell her it's time.

 (HANDMAIDS WHISPERING)     
 (GROANS)     
 (PANTING)

 Please bless us. Please.

 A fine and healthy girl.     
 (LAUGHS)     
 God be praised. (LAUGHS)     
 AUNT LYDIA: Clumsy!     
 (LAUGHTER)     
 AUNT LYDIA: This is a time for rejoicing, my love.     
 This is our happy, happy moment.     
 (COOING)     
 Think of what's to come for you, my girl.     
 (AUNT LYDIA LAUGHS)     
 (LAUGHS)     
 OFFRED: Okay. All right. It's okay.     
 Look at me. Look at me.     
 She's beautiful. She's beautiful.     
 (LAUGHS)     
 Precious. Precious. Look at this one.     
 (AUNT LYDIA LAUGHS)     
 LEAH: She's just perfect.     
 CAROLINE: Isn't she?     
 SERENA JOY: Do you have a name?     
 Angela.

 Angela.     
 Luke?     
 - LUKE: Hey. 
- Hey.     
 Are you hungry? I got some snacks.     
 Where is she?     
 Did they take her for a blood test?     
 - Huh? 
- Hannah. She's not here.     
 - I don't know. 
- I thought you had her.     
 (ALARM BLARING)     
 - WOMAN: (OVER PA)  Code Yellow. FMC Baby. 
- What's that?     
 I don't know. Wait here, honey.     
 - Luke? 
- WOMAN: (OVER PA)  Code Yellow. FMC baby.   
 No, wait there. I'll be right back.     
 (ALARM CONTINUES BLARING)     
 WOMAN: I don't see her.     
 Luke?

 JUNE: What?     
 - Stay here. 
- JUNE: Oh, my God.     
 (ALARM CONTINUES)     
 Hey. Excuse me?     
 Excuse me?     
 What are you doing?     
 She's alive.     
 (ALARM CONTINUES)     
 My baby.     
 I told them.     
 She's not your baby.     
 Of course she is.     
 Isn't she beautiful?     
 (ALARM CONTINUES)     
 Luke?     
 Okay, wait, wait, wait, wait! Hey, stop!     
 She's here! Stop!     
 - Don't take my baby! 
- No. She's here!     
 - No! No! 
- Take the baby!     
 (HANNAH WAILING)     
 Stop!     
 It's my baby! My baby! I'm the father.     
 She's mine. She's my baby. 
Just give her to me, Luke.     
 - PROTESTER: (SCREAMS) No! 
- Give her to me.     
 Okay, she's fine. Give her to me.     
 Give her to me.     
 PROTESTER: (SOBBING) Don't take my baby!     
 - Here you are. 
- Is she okay?     
 - Yeah, she's okay. 
- Is she all right?     
 She's okay.     
 - PROTESTER: Don't take my baby! 
- She's crying a lot.     
 Don't take my baby!     
 (SCREAMS) Please!     
 (WHISPERS) No one knew anything     
 about what your Commander might want.     
 Sorry.     
 But that doesn't mean it's bad.     
 If he accuses you of something,     
 don't defend yourself. Don't explain.     
 Just apologize.     
 They love to be forgiving.     
 Okay.     
 - Thank you for trying. 
- No worries.     
 He probably just wants a blowjob.     
 What did he say?     
 When he asked to see you alone?     
 He didn't. He sent his driver, Nick.     
 Be careful. A lot of the drivers work for the Eyes.     
 He said I shouldn't trust you.     
 He said you were dangerous.     
 - Really? 
- Yeah.     
 I mean he's right. 
Trusting anyone is dangerous.     
 Especially a carpet-munching gender traitor.

You okay by yourself?     
 - Yeah, I nursed my son. 
- (ANGELA WAILING)     
 I've done it before.     
 (WAILING CONTINUES)     
 Come on.     
 Come on. It's right there.     
 Come on. Shh.

 (TOLLING CONTINUES)     
 OFFRED:  Beyond the Commander's door is a place where women do not go.   
 Not even Serena Joy.   
 What male totems are kept in there?   
 I guess there may be something he wants from me.   
 To want is to have a weakness.   
 That gives me hope.   
 But I can't stop thinking about the girl   
 in the horror movie who goes down into the basement   
 when the light is out.   
 The girl who thinks her boyfriend   
 with the perfect hair is just playing a sexy prank.   
 "Justin, are you down there?"   
 And then she descends, with a stupid smile,   
 to her bloody end.   
 That girl is a f*cking moron.   
 COMMANDER: Come in.     
 OFFRED:  Please, God, don't let me be a f*cking moron.   
 (EXHALES)     
 COMMANDER: Close the door behind you.     
 Sit down.     
 Please.     
 Thank you for coming.     
 You're welcome.     
 You can look at me.     
 We're not supposed to.     
 In here, we might be able to bend the rules.     
 Just a bit.     
 Hello there.     
 Hi.     
 I imagine you must find this strange.     
 I guess it's a little strange.     
 I want... This will sound silly.     
 I'd like to play a game with you.     
 - A game? 
- Yes.     
 Do you know how to play?     
 - Yes. 
- Good.     
 Three-eighty-six     
 to three-eighty-three.     
 You're good, but I caught you at the end there.     
 I'm rusty.     
 Then we'll have to have a rematch.     
 All right.     
 I'm out of town next week, but when I get back?     
 I'll check my schedule.     
 Well.     
 See if you can squeeze me in.     
 Where are you going?     
 D.C.     
 Nothing exciting, just meetings.     
 Well, after you get back, then.     
 It's a date.     
 Now, I think it's time for you to go home.     
 Thank you for the game.     
 You're very welcome.     
 Good night.     
 Good night.

 OFFRED:  Does he know what the Commander and I did last night?   
 Our illicit journey into the world of triple word scores?   
 Does he care?   
 I think he does.   
 Ofglen.   
 I can tell her that the Commander is going to Washington.   
 Will she be surprised by the Scrabble game?   
 She'll be glad I let him win. I know that much.   
 She'll be proud of me for that.   
 ♪ Will you recognize me? ♪   
 (SONG STOPS ABRUPTLY)     
 Blessed be the fruit.     
 May the Lord open.     
 You must be Offred.     
 Yes.     
 Praised be.     
 We've been sent good weather.     
 Yes.     
 Which I receive with joy.     
 Has Ofglen been transferred to a new post so soon?     
 I am Ofglen.     
 OFFRED:  f*ck.
