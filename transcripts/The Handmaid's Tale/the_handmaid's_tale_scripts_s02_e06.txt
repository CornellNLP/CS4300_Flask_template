 [Offred]  Previously   on  The Handmaid's Tale...   
 - Ofglen! 
- They cut out her tongue.   
 You didn't make her say anything.   
 This wasn't your fault.   
 As an Eye, you'll chiefly be reporting on the activities   
 - of your own commander, Fred Waterford. 
- Yes, sir.   
 You know my driver? The boy's got a lot of potential, and I'm afraid he's wasting here.    
 I'm surprised you'd let him go.    
 If I were you, I'd find a way to keep him around.    
 [Andrew] And the Lord God said, thy desire shall be to thy husband, and he shall rule over thee.    
 I now pronounce you man and wife.    
 [applause]    
 Are you okay?    
 I'm fine, thank you.    
 [Serena] Welcome to our home, Miss Spencer.    
 [Eden] I'm so blessed to join your honored household.    
 It is your duty to bear children.    
 [Commander Fred] 
Gilead values the family.    
 By God's grace, I'll have a child of my own someday, sir.    
 [Commander Fred] By God's grace.    
 Thank God. I'll get the doctor.    
 [Offred] I will not let you grow up in this place.    
 I'm gonna get you out of here.    
 [machine beeps]    
 [ultrasound machine whirring]    
 [doctor] The hemorrhage was here, near the uterine wall.    
 I know that much blood can be alarming.    
 But, by His hand, your baby looks absolutely fine, Mrs. Waterford.    
 The condition isn't uncommon.    
 [Serena] A subchorianic hematoma.    
 [doctor] Yes.    
 We'll keep an eye on it for now, but it should resolve on its own.    
 [Serena] I've heard that estrogen can be effective?    
 [doctor] Well, the bleeding has stopped for now.    
 We'll consider it if the time comes.    
 [clears throat]    
 Any complications with your first pregnancy?    
 With Hannah?    
 [doctor] During your first pregnancy.    
 No.    
 [doctor] She was full term?    
 Two weeks early, actually.    
 Hmm. Close enough. Praise be.    
 She needs plenty of rest. 
Just take things slowly.    
 And communicate.    
 This baby needs harmony within the household.    
 [Serena] Of course.    
 [doctor] Oh, look, Mrs. Waterford.    
 Your baby is moving around in there.    
 - [Serena] Oh! 
- [doctor chuckles]    
 [Serena] Offred...    
 Would you like to see?    
 Hello.    
 It's doing somersaults in there.    
 Praised be.    
 [Serena] Hello? Look who's home.    
 God bless you.    
 [Serena] Rita, can you please make Offred her smoothie?    
 No.    
 I'm sorry. Just... it's hard on my stomach.    
 No. No need to apologize.    
 How about some soup?    
 Sure. Thank you.    
 - [Serena] Rita? 
- Yes, ma'am. Right away.    
 - I'll stay and help. 
- Wonderful.    
 [Serena] Offred, you need your rest.    
 Rita will serve you in my sitting room.    
 You can't possibly climb the stairs in this condition.    
 [Serena] Go on now, let's get you comfortable.    
 Get going. You wanna help? Help.    
 [birds chirping]    
 [footsteps approaching]    
 [Nick] June.    
 [Offred] I'm fine.    
 - We're fine. 
- You scared me.    
 I scared myself.    
 They've got you sleeping in here?    
 Mmm-hmm.    
 [sighs]    
 She made me an offer I couldn't refuse.    
 Okay. I'll come see you tonight.    
 What about Mrs. Blaine?    
 What is her bedtime, anyway?    
 [Nick sighs]    
 You know I didn't have a choice.    
 [Offred] I know.    
 But we...    
 What?    
 We can't keep sneaking around anymore.    
 We have to be smart.    
 Yeah.    
 You know, I think about us. 
The three of us, what we could be.     
 I think about it all the time.     
 Well, don't.     
 Okay, I'll stop.     
 [Nick sighs]     
 I think about it too.     
 [footsteps approaching]     
 [Rita clears throat]     
 [Rita] Soup.     
 As ordered.     
 I'm really sorry she's making you run around like this.     
 You milk it while you can.     
 Smells good. Where's mine?     
 Ask your wife.     
 [Commander Fred] Remove the debris and hose it down.     
 And tell them to watch the spacing.     
 [worker] Move back. Move back.     
 [aunt Lydia] 
Commander Waterford. [chuckles]     
 Everything looks just marvelous.     
 - A step up from the old place? 
- Oh, yes.     
 Imagine how many more girls we can process here. We are truly blessed.     
 I'm so pleased that your Handmaid is coming home today.     
 She gave us quite a scare.     
 [Commander Fred] Yes. Well, the baby's in good health.     
 - That's what matters. 
- Praised be.     
 [aunt Lydia] The dynamics between a Wife and a pregnant Handmaid are always challenging.     
 But if you'll forgive me, you have been blessed     
 - with a particularly willful pair. 
- [both laugh]     
 Precisely why I stay out of it.     
 [indistinct radio chatter]     
 [aunt Lydia] But I'm sure, should the need arise, you will know just how to handle things.     
 - [Commander Fred] Yes. 
- [Andrew] Waterford! Up here.     
 Excuse me.     
 [indistinct chatter]     
 [indistinct chatter]     
 [Commander Fred clears throat]     
 Gentlemen. What a surprise.     
 Welcome to the Rachel and Leah Center.     
 [Andrew] I thought you'd be further along by now.     
 [Commander Fred] 
Just the finishing touches.     
 There are still no seats in the lecture hall.     
 [Warren] We're expecting brothers from every district.     
 Where are they supposed to sit?     
 Gentlemen, we'll be ready.     
 Two days is more than enough time.     
 Trust me...     
 We're going to dazzle them.     
 Do you like your potatoes roasted that way?     
 They were good.     
 I can make them different.     
 No, they're fine.     
 Delicious.     
 Do you want to know the secret?     
 Sure.     
 Rosemary.     
 Mrs. Waterford gave me some from her garden.     
 I got the recipe from my mother.     
 It must be hard.     
 To leave your family.     
 You're my family now.     
 This is everything I prayed for.     
 Well, let me know if you need anything.     
 Thank you, Nick.     
 Thank you. For dinner.     
 Oh! That's my job, silly.     
 My mother taught me how to cook and keep house.     
 She taught me all about marriage.     
 About everything.     
 I know it's expected of me.     
 What God expects of me.     
 You can smoke in here.     
 [Nick] Oh, it's okay.     
 Smoke inside.     
 Uh, it's your house. 
You can do what you want.     
 [door closes]     
 [footsteps approaching]     
 [Serena] You look nice and cozy.     
 Um, thank you.     
 Go on. Get comfortable.     
 Mrs. Waterford, I think I can manage.     
 What if you need something?     
 I'll be right here.     
 Yeah.     
 [Offred grunts]     
 I'm sorry. The clicking.     
 Hmm? Oh, no, it's just, uh...     
 It's getting harder to find a good position.     
 Do you remember those huge pillows for expectant mothers?     
 A pregnancy pillow? Yes.     
 Those were sweet.     
 Sweet.     
 I'll look into getting one for us.     
 Thank you.     
 Offred?     
 Yes?     
 What's it like to feel that life inside of you?     
 There's nothing much happening right now. But... if you want, you can come and feel it.     
 Come on.     
 Give me your hand.     
 [gasps]     
 You feel that?     
 Praised be.     
 [chuckles softly] It's a miracle.     
 Yeah. It is.     
 Today, we find ourselves at a crossroads.     
 We've lost our way. 
Our values and our sense of...     
 Today, we confront a crisis.     
 No, Fred, you can't change 
things at the last minute.     
 [Commander Fred] Well, it's stronger.     
 But watch your tone. 
Don't scold or lecture.     
 Yes, start a dialogue.     
 - A conversation. 
- Okay.     
 Serena, sweetheart, this is what we wanted. Hmm?     
 Our policies and ideas discussed in the mainstream.     
 - You did that. 
- [crowd chattering]     
 - [Jenny] Mrs. Waterford? 
- Are they ready for me?     
 Oh, yeah. They're ready.     
 [footsteps receding]     
 [crowd jeering]     
 - Serena Joy. Good afternoon. 
- Joe Schneider.     
 - Nice to meet you. 
- Fred Waterford. Nice to meet you.     
 Joe Schneider. 
Nice to meet you. Come on in.     
 [host] You may not agree with what she has to say.     
 But that's what's great about our country.     
 - The freedom to express your own opinion. 
- [crowd jeering]     
 She is on our campus here as a guest so, please,     
 - let's welcome Serena Joy Waterford. 
- Stay focused. Stay calm.     
 [crowd jeering]     
 [woman] f*ck you!     
 [air horn blaring]     
 [jeering and booing continues]     
 - Get the f*ck outta here! 
- We don't want you in our school!     
 We don't believe in anything you do!     
 - You and your stupid... 
- f*ck you!     
 [man] Quiet! Let her talk!     
 Good afternoon. It's my honor to be...     
 - Nazi c**t! 
- [man] Yeah!     
 Nazi c**t! Get outta here, Nazi!     
 Go!     
 Quiet! Let her speak!     
 Sit down, you stupid little bitch! Hey, f*ck you!     
 When I first received your invitation to come...     
 [man  ] We take it back, you f*cking fanatic!     
 [woman  ] Fascist bitch! Go home!     
 [crowd] Yes!     
 [clamoring]     
 [woman] f*ck you!     
 - Sorry. We've made a mistake! 
- She has a right to speak!     
 - It's not safe! 
- This is America!     
 [plate clattering]     
 [cutlery clanking]     
 [Commander Fred] Did I wake you?     
 No,     
 I just get really thirsty now, so I was gonna get some water.     
 Help yourself.     
 [water flowing]     
 Are you mad at me?     
 [scoffs]     
 Why'd you say that?     
 'Cause we haven't talked at all since I came home.     
 What's there to talk about?     
 It's just... It's been so long.     
 Yes, well...     
 I've got a lot on my plate, so to speak.     
 - Would you like some? 
- Oh. No, thank you.     
 Sure? You're eating for two.     
 [Offred chuckles softly]     
 No. But Aunt Lydia is very strict about the weigh-ins.     
 We can't have you getting all roly-poly now, can we?     
 [Commander Fred chuckles]     
 You look healthy to me.     
 Pregnancy suits you.     
 I should be getting back.     
 Before Mrs. Waterford misses me.     
 Your guardian angel.     
 She's been very kind.     
 Under His eye.     
 [Commander Fred] Yes.     
 [birds chirping]     
 Blessed day.     
 Blessed day.     
 Mrs. Waterford's not in here?     
 No, just me.     
 Can I help you with something?     
 I'll be all right.     
 I feel so stupid.     
 He left again last night.     
 Nick?     
 He hates me.     
 No.     
 He doesn't.     
 He does.     
 He won't touch me. I'm ugly.     
 You're not.     
 You're very pretty.     
 He doesn't think so.     
 You know, this is all new to him, too.     
 He's trying to be respectful.     
 So, what do I do?     
 Just give it some time.     
 [Eden] We can't wait.     
 It's our duty to God.     
 Um...     
 I think God knows that every couple is different.     
 He wouldn't want you to force it.     
 You're gonna find a way to be together.     
 What if we don't?     
 What if he can't?     
 What do you mean?     
 What if Nick's a gender traitor?     
 I'm sure that is not true.     
 Hold onto him.     
 He is gonna make a great father to your children.     
 [footsteps approaching]     
 [Serena] Offred?     
 Offred, could you come here, please?     
 - Yes, Mrs.... 
- Surprise!     
 I thought that you could enjoy some time with your friends while you recover.     
 Were you surprised?     
 Um, yes.     
 Very.     
 Well, please, sit.     
 Girls, please, sit.     
 - Rita? 
- Yes, ma'am.     
 I'm so glad that your mistresses allowed you all to come today.     
 [clears throat] Shall we say grace?     
 Bless us, oh, Lord, for these Thy gifts which we are about to receive from Thy bounty.     
 - Amen. 
- Amen.     
 Please, dig in.     
 Don't be shy.     
 I'm sure that you have a lot to catch up on.     
 [Alma] We've been sent fine weather.     
 Yes. Yes, we have.     
 Praised be.     
 [Oferic] Praised be.     
 Ofglen, what about you?     
 You must miss your companion.     
 Pretend you're on one of your walks.     
 What is it that the two of you talk...     
 Does anyone remember the name of that place on Boylston?     
 Uh, they had great brunch.     
 [Ofsamuel] I'm from Framingham.     
 [Oferic] I never ate brunch.     
 Well, they... It was amazing.     
 The food was great, and they had something called the liberated Omelet with eclectic Potatoes.     
 [Alma] Oh! That earthy-crunchy place.     
 Magnolia's.     
 Yeah. Yeah, that's right.     
 They had the most amazing banana nut pancakes.     
 Who knows, maybe we were there at the same time.     
 Serendipity.     
 Someone's awake.     
 Do you want to feel it?     
 Just right there.     
 Can you feel that?     
 [chuckles]     
 [all chuckle]     
 [Oferic] It feels so funny.     
 [Offred] It's weird, right?     
 [Ofsamuel] It's weird. How are you feeling that?     
 - [Alma] She wants to get out. 
- Mmm-hmm.     
 [handmaids laugh]     
 [Ofsamuel] It's a she. It's definitely gonna be a she.     
 [Alma] Definitely.     
 [birds chirping]     
 [dogs barking in the distance]     
 [air horns blaring]     
 [Jenny] Mr. Waterford, we should go.     
 - We're not going. 
- They won't even hear me.     
 No, we're not going.     
 [crowd clapping]     
 [guard] Stand back! Stand back, please.     
 Back up! All of you!     
 [Commander Fred] We won't be silent!     
 Make them hear you! Make them hear you!     
 [Serena] Can I say a few words?     
 Please let me speak!     
 Quiet! Quiet! Please shut up!     
 Let me speak!     
 You want me to stay silent but that is not gonna to change what is happening in our country!     
 f*ck you!     
 - Come on! 
- f*ck you, c**t!     
 You're spoilt! You're privileged and you're living in an academic bubble! 
All of you!     
 - [man] Yeah, let her speak! 
- [crowd chattering]     
 The rate of healthy births has dropped     
    percent in the last    months!     
 - [crowd cheering] 
- Whoo!     
 That is exactly the problem that we need to focus on right now.     
 The future, and the future of mankind, depends on what we do today!     
 - [crowd cheering] 
- What we do now!     
 f*ck that!     
 [Serena] The human race is in danger!     
 Every single one of you, women especially, embrace your biological destiny!     
 [crowd cheering]     
 This affects us all!     
 [guard  ] Stay back!     
 [guard  ] Move!     
 We didn't back down. You're incredible.     
 That was awesome, Mrs. Waterford. 
Twitter is blowing up.     
 You're a truthteller!     
 I want to add more cities to the tour. 
I want to add San Francisco...     
 [gunshot]     
 [crowd screaming]     
 
 
 
 [gunshot]     
 [Commander Fred] 
Serena, no! Serena! No! Serena!     
 [gasping]     
 [Serena] I know we still have a few more months but I just want everything to be ready.     
 It's actually been a lot of fun.     
 [Offred sighs]     
 [Serena] So?     
 It's beautiful, Mrs. Waterford.     
 [Serena] The wallpaper, it's not too much?     
 No.     
 No, I don't think so. I like it.     
 It's lovely.     
 Yeah.     
 Yes, it is.     
 I want you to know, I'm going to be the best mother I can be to my child.     
 Thank you for showing me the nursery.     
 It's very special.     
 Well, it's a work in progress.     
 Thank you.     
 Thank you.     
 [chuckles softly]     
 We had these glow-in-the-dark stars on the ceiling of Hannah's bedroom.     
 My husband knows all about stars so, we'd climb into bed and he'd, you know, point out the constellations.     
 Pleiades and the Big Dipper.     
 Hannah loved it.     
 If I could see her, it would just... It would make me feel so much better.     
 Just to know she's okay.     
 - That's not possible. 
- Serena, please.     
 Just a few minutes.     
 I won't tell anyone.     
 Absolutely not.     
 Get your things out from downstairs.     
 I think it's time for you to go back to your room.     
 What's going on?     
 What happened?     
 - June? 
- I thought she could be decent.     
 I asked about Hannah.     
 - You know she'd never do that. 
- She is my daughter!     
 - I want to see my own daughter! 
- We'll find a way.     
 Not if you're on the Wall.     
 So, you have to sleep with Eden.     
 Uh-huh.     
 She's gonna report you. 
She will make trouble.     
 She's    years old.     
 What, you have to f*ck somebody you don't want to?     
 - Poor thing. 
- [Nick] That's not fair.     
 Fair?     
 I can't.     
 Yes, you can. Because I can't lose you. 
Do you hear me?     
 I love you.     
 She is your wife.     
 [sobbing]     
 [exhales]     
 [Nick] And God blessed them and God said unto them,     
 Be fruitful and multiply, and replenish the earth.     
 Have dominion over the fish of the sea and over every living thing that moveth upon the earth.     
 Amen.     
 You sure?     
 May God in His infinite love and wisdom look down upon us.     
 [sighs]     
 You're gonna be a great father, Nick.     
 [Eden gasps]     
 [Eden breathes heavily]     
 [Nick grunts]     
 You okay?     
 Yeah.     
 [Eden breathing heavily]     
 I can't wait to see if it worked.     
 If not, we'll just keep trying.     
 The green thumb strikes again.     
 [chuckles]     
 Rita said you've been in here all afternoon.     
 [Serena] Rita needs to mind her business.     
 I'm fine, Fred. Just let me be.     
 I know she can be difficult.     
 [Serena] She's devious.     
 She's always plotting. 
Always wanting more.     
 She wanted to see the child.     
 Her child from before.     
 I really thought that we could be... Shoot!     
 Let me see.     
 - [Serena] It's nothing. 
- [Commander Fred] Come here.     
 - That hurt? 
- No.     
 You'd never say if it did.     
 My wife.     
 Always so strong.     
 I pray, every day, "Dear Lord...     
 "Make me worthy."     
 [Commander Fred] ...save America.     
 [Commander Fred] Easy. Let me help you.     
 Fred. Stop. Stop fussing.     
 Where were we?     
 No, we don't have to do this now.     
 Yes, we do. 
People are listening right now.     
 All right, um...     
 We will not allow a fanatic...     
 [Serena] A terrorist.     
 He's a terrorist.     
 We will not allow a terrorist to silence us but the truth can be hard to hear.     
 But only the truth can save America now.     
 Yeah. I think that's good.     
 And I thought we could segue into justice being served.     
 [Serena] That's if they ever find him.     
 They will. Put your faith in God.     
 I have faith in God but I don't have faith in the police.     
 [Serena groans]     
 Serena, I never should have let you start speaking in public.     
 [breathing heavily]     
 You stop that.     
 Stop it and be a man.     
 [gasping]     
 [sobbing]     
 [indistinct chatter over radio]

 [Commander Fred] 
You tried to kill my wife.     
 I said in my heart,     
 God shall judge the righteous     
 - and the wicked... 
- [muffled] Please!     
 ...for there is a time there for every purpose and for every work.     
 [man whimpering]     
 Do you know what it was like to see my wife in pain?     
 To pray to God to save her?     
 [man] No! Please, no!     
 [woman] No, no, no!     
 [man] No! No!     
 Now you do.     
 [man] No!     
 [man yelling]     
 [thunder rumbling]     
 [footsteps approaching]     
 [Offred] You shouldn't be in here.     
 [chuckles] Well, that's not the welcome I was anticipating.     
 Your wife would be very angry.     
 [Commander Fred] This is my house.     
 [sighs]     
 I hoped she could manage things here at home.     
 But I see now I need to step in and keep the peace.     
 I have something for you.     
 [breathing heavily]     
 [gasps]     
 [Commander Fred] It's good to see you happy again.     
 [sniffles]     
 Thank you.     
 I've missed you.     
 I've missed you, too.     
 [Commander Fred] Feels different.     
 I like it.     
 [Commander Fred] I want you.     
 Me too. I'm just... I'm sorry.     
 I just... I'm worried about the baby.     
 You know?     
 Sorry.     
 [Offred] Thank you.     
 Our little secret.     
 Of course.     
 [Commander Fred] Good night.     
 [door opens]     
 [door closes]     
 [breathes heavily]     
 [sobbing]     
 Welcome, Commander.     
 [Andrew] Well done.     
 - [Commander Fred] Praised be. 
- [Andrew] Congratulations.     
 Thank you, sir.     
 [indistinct chatter over radio]     
 [Commander Fred] Welcome, Commander. Praised be.     
 [Warren] Under His Eye.     
 [Nick] Commander Pryce?     
 [Andrew] Nick. Blessed day. Very exciting.     
 Sir, I need your help. Reassign me.     
 A new post. 
I'll go to the front. Wherever.     
 Nick, slow down.     
 I can't stay in that house anymore.     
 You've just been issued a woman. 
Is there a problem?     
 It's not her.     
 There's a lot 
I haven't told you about him.     
 Reassign me.     
 Promise me you'll protect the Handmaid.     
 You have my word.     
 [plate clinking]     
 Finish your food.     
 I'm full, Mrs. Waterford.     
 [Serena] Rita.     
 Will you wrap Offred's plate?     
 She'll have the rest of it later. All of it.     
 [Rita] Yes, ma'am.     
 [Eden] Blessed day.     
 Blessed day. How are you this morning?     
 Fine, thank you.     
 Blessed be the fruit.     
 May the Lord open.     
 [Eden] I was just hoping to help you, Mrs. Waterford.     
 Is there anything that you need?     
 [Serena] No. Aren't you sweet?     
 I wish Offred were as pleasant.     
 It is so important to understand one's place in a household.     
 Wouldn't you agree?     
 Yes, Mrs. Waterford.     
 No, no. You are a married woman of faith.     
 The Handmaid will do it.     
 Thank you, Offred.     
 You're welcome, Mrs. Waterford.     
 Now, you try.     
 Don't you want to run a household of your own one day?     
 [Eden] Yes, praised be.     
 Go on.     
 She needs to learn. 
Blessed is the teacher.     
 I felt a cramp.     
 So...     
 Don't want to hurt the baby.     
 Of course not.     
 [Serena] Thank you, Eden.     
 [Commander Fred] My brothers, may I present to you the new Rachel and Leah Center.     
 [applause]     
 By God's grace, we gather to celebrate the dawn of a bright and bountiful future     
 - that begins right here... 
- [applause]     
 ...with the devotion of His humble servants, our Handmaids!     
 [applause]     
 My brothers, this facility represents a shared vision to restore a moral world in which we can serve God.     
 Now, our hopeful prayer has turned into something real and permanent.     
 Here, we can continue to show our commitment to Him and His word and to honor our promise to the people of Gilead.     
 That we will replenish this earth with healthy children of faith.     
 From the beginning that has always been...     
 Uh, it's not time yet. Tell her to go back.     
 [rapid ticking]     
 Go back!     
 [explosion]
