 [June]  Previously   on  The Handmaid's Tale...   
 I know what they did to you.   
 - I'm so sorry. 
- [wailing]   
 Ofglen.   
 My name is Emily.   
 - [tires screeching] 
- [Janine] What's she doing?   
 [Handmaids screaming]   
 Every Handmaid who followed you into disobedience will face the consequences, but not you.    
 You are with child. You are protected.    
 [doctor] That is your baby, Mrs. Waterford.    
 God has created a new soul.    
 Godspeed, June.    
 [Commander Fred]  I am taking command of all your units.   
 The missing Handmaid is with child.    
 Right now, she is the only priority.   
 [Nick] Hey.    
 Can't get you out of the city.   
 Someone will come get you.   
 They have a place you can stay.   
 Until it's safe to move.    
 [June]  My name is June Osborne.   
 I am... free.   
 [theme music playing]    
 [bars clanking]    
 [June]  Is this what freedom looks like?   
 [horn blaring]    
 Even this much is dizzying.   
 Like an elevator with open sides.   
 In the upper reaches of the atmosphere, you'd come apart.   
 You'd vaporize.   
 There'd be no pressure to hold you together.   
 We get so comfortable with walls.   
 It doesn't even take that long.   
 Wear the red dress, wear the wings,   
 shut your mouth, be a good girl.   
 Roll over and spread your legs.   
 Yes, ma'am.   
 May the Lord open.   
 [gasps]    
 [siren wailing]    
 What will happen when I get out?   
 I probably don't have to worry about it,   
 because there probably is no out.   
 "Gilead knows no bounds," Aunt Lydia said.   
 "Gilead is within you.   
 Like the spirit of the Lord."   
 Or the Commander's cock.   
 Or cancer.   
 [rattling]    
 Come on.    
 Chop, chop.    
 [driver] Place has been empty since before the war.    
 I come by here once a week, check the rat traps.    
 Make sure nothing's leaking too bad.    
 Here, come on. You wanna give me a hand here? Come on.    
 [June] Sorry.    
 Come on. Let's go.    
 There's water, and there's power.    
 But you better just stay inside.    
 You get me?    
 You're gonna need that.    
 Hey!    
 What's next?    
 I'm supposed to get you here safe.    
 You're here safe.    
 Maybe see you in a few days, if you're still around?    
 Under His eye.    
 [driver] After a while, crocodile.    
 [truck engine starts]    
 [engine idling]    
 [helicopter blades whirring]    
 [shutter closing]    
 [sirens wailing in distance]    
 [June breathing heavily]    
 [shuddering]    
 [sirens continue wailing]    
 [breathing heavily]    
 [Unwoman coughs]    
 [Unwomen grunting]    
 [Unwomen coughing]    
 [aunt Sarah] Back to work!    
 You, too.    
 [aunt] You! Go get your tools!    
 [ringing]    
 [Unwomen praying] 
Let us sing unto the Lord.    
 The Lord is great and He is merciful.    
 The sinners and the whores are blessed with His grace,    
 - so great and kind is He. 
- ...the whores are blessed...    
 ...so great and kind is He.    
 [Unwomen] May He bless us with His mercy forever and ever.    
 May He bless us with...    
 Biome is a pretty flexible classification.    
 It can describe the biosphere of the entire planet, or the microbial community living on the skin of a spider.     
 All right, here's where cell biology gets personal.     
 I want you to smell yourselves.     
 [students chuckling]     
 I'm serious.     
 Noses in armpits.     
 You smell that?     
 That is the smell of your microbiome.     
 Bacteria, fungi, viruses...     
 Yes, Jenna?     
 Sorry, but how do the different species of bacteria compete?     
 I mean, archaea, protists, and all that? Do...     
 There aren't archaea in the human microbiome.     
 They're only found in extreme environments, like salt lakes.     
 Not your armpits.     
 Actually, archaea have been found in skin, in the colon and in the nasal cavity.     
 There've been some recent papers.     
 I'll send you a reading list, if you like.     
 Thanks.     
 [indistinct chatter]     
 [man] Hey, wait up!     
 [Emily] Jenna?     
 You got a minute?     
 Sure.     
 [exhales] You know, you're smart.     
 You belong here.     
 Thanks.     
 Don't let some guy make you feel like your questions aren't valid.     
 Okay. I'll try.     
 That stuff gets better, right?     
 Like in grad school?     
 God, no.     
 Just stick with it.     
 [cell phone vibrating]     
 - Is that your baby? 
- Yeah.     
 He's ours. Oliver.     
 He's super cute.     
 Well, I have to get this. I'll see you Wednesday.     
 Thank you.     
 - Thanks. 
- Oh, um...     
 - You want? I didn't know. 
- I'm good.     
 I'm supposed to use Stevia. [chuckles]     
 That's all we have at the house.     
 How's everything going?     
 Everything's good.     
 Good. Great.     
 So...     
 So, next semester...     
 Next semester.     
 I have some good news, actually.     
 It looks like we're gonna be able to get you, uh, some nice chunk of extra lab time.     
 [Emily] That's awesome.     
 I know how hard it is to carve out research time when you're teaching so much.     
 So, good news.     
 You're giving away one of my classes?     
 I want you to focus on your mitochondrial lines.     
 Exclusively.     
 I'm not teaching next semester.     
 - At all. 
- Not this fall, no.     
 But it won't affect your tenure application.     
 [door opens]     
 - [heels clacking] 
- [indistinct chatter]     
 More lab time. This is exciting.     
 [Emily exhales] What the hell, Dan?     
 This is an opportunity.     
 You're pulling me from the classroom.     
 You should think of this as an opportunity.     
 As opposed to what it is.     
 What is it?     
 It's caution.     
 It's an overabundance of caution, I'm sure.     
 The new board of regents is concerned that you're not maintaining a healthy learning environment.     
 Do you have a picture of Syl and Oliver on your phone?     
 Of course.     
 That probably wasn't smart.     
 But I'm not going to hide my family.     
 I... I'm not asking you to.     
 You just did.     
 Look, things are unstable right now.     
 After DC, people are afraid.     
 I think that if we lay low for a little while as a department, things can settle out.     
 So, you thought it was time to hide the dykes.     
 [sighs]     
 You know, I took all the pictures of Paul from my office.     
 I noticed.     
 I thought you guys had a fight.     
 We did.     
 A few.     
 He says I'm a collaborator.     
 Paul's a drama queen.     
 [exhales] They... They can't scare us back into the closet.     
 I thought mine was the last generation that would have to deal with this bullshit.     
 I thought all of you were all so spoiled.     
 Not anymore.     
 I'm teaching next semester.     
 Sorry.     
 Welcome to the fight.     
 It sucks.     
 [indistinct shouting]     
 [horse neighs]     
 - [cattle prod buzzes] 
- [Unwoman cries out]     
 [aunt Sarah] Facing forward!     
 [Unwomen coughing]     
 [horse whinnies]     
 [coughing]     
 [Unwomen chattering softly]     
 [winces]     
 Sorry. That one's still bad.     
 Yeah.     
 Just let it get some air tonight and I'll bandage it up again in the morning.     
 Thanks, doll.     
 Best nail place in town.     
 Give me a good review on Yelp.     
 [moans]     
 [Unwomen coughing]     
 Her fever's back.     
 Yeah.     
 [Unwoman] Oh, God, please.     
 Claire found some more duck eggs, traded them for Tylenol.     
 Don't waste it.     
 She can't even hold down water.     
 Maybe some mint tea?     
 Could settle her stomach.     
 [Unwoman moaning]     
 [wind howling]     
 [vehicles approaching]     
 [bell ringing]     
 [aunt Pauline] Get inside.     
 Come on.     
 [Unwomen coughing]     
 [aunt Pauline] Move, wife.     
 Find an empty cot.     
 [Mrs. O'Conner] Blessings to you.     
 [spits] f*cking bitch.     
 Go in grace.     
 Dear God, thank you for your good and generous blessings.     
 Give me strength to perform your good works here on Earth.     
 [helicopter blades whirring]     
 [blows]     
 [switch clanks]     
 [electricity humming]     
 [sniffling]     
 [crying]     
 [shutters opening]     
 [shutters closing]     
 [footsteps approaching]     
 [Nick] June?     
 [hammer clatters]     
 You're okay.     
 - What happened? 
- Nothing.     
 Let's get out of here.     
 Do I need to take anything to...     
 Food or... Should I even take the water?     
 June, you can't leave. They're looking for you everywhere.     
 I don't care. I don't care.     
 [Nick] You're not a Martha making a run for the border.     
 You're a pregnant Handmaid.     
 I know that.     
 f*cking Christ, don't you think I know that?     
 June, what's going on?     
 You have to get me out of here.     
 There's nowhere for you to go.     
 You know what this is?     
 Do you know what happened here?     
 It's a slaughterhouse.     
 You've just gotta be patient.     
 We've gotten this far. Things will calm down in a few weeks.     
 Weeks?     
 Yeah.     
 - f*ck. Weeks? 
- Probably.     
 How long does it take to get someone out of here?     
 That's not how this works.     
 Why don't you tell me how it works, then?     
 I don't know. I've never done this before.     
 They don't tell me anything.     
 Do you know how hard it was to find out you were here?     
 You don't know?     
 You don't know? You just... What, you...     
 You just hand me over to Mayday and you don't know?     
 'Cause you want to play the hero? Huh, Nick?     
 What the f*ck are you talking about?     
 Who played hero at the stoning like some kind of f*cking rebel Handmaid Commander?     
 - You made that choice. 
- It wasn't a choice.     
 I'm trying to keep you alive.     
 You and our baby. I'm helping you.     
 I am risking my life to help you.     
 - You're being so f*cking stubborn. 
- We're gonna go north.     
 We can drive north across Maine. 
I know where to go.     
 To Maine? You're never gonna make it to Maine.     
 Hannah. We have to get Hannah.     
 - You know where she is, right? 
- No, of course not.     
 Well, you're an Eye. 
Find out. Ask Serena.     
 - Jesus. 
- Make her tell you.     
 June, it wouldn't make a difference. 
They'll be watching Hannah.     
 - I don't care. 
- They probably have Guardians     
 - Just find out where she is! 
- ...assigned to that house.     
 - You're safe here! 
- Stop saying that!     
 We're gonna get Hannah. 
We're gonna go north!     
 No.     
 No, we're not.     
 - I'm sorry. We're not. 
- Give me the keys.     
 - What? 
- Give me the keys.     
 [scoffs]     
 Give 'em to me!     
 [Nick] Fine.     
 Wait, June.     
 [car powering up]     
 [beeping]     
 f*ck.     
 f*ck! f*ck! f*ck!     
 f*ck!     
 [car powering down]     
 [crying]     
 [shutters closing]     
 [Nick grunts]     
 [Nick inhales sharply]     
 [both gasping]     
 [Nick grunts]     
 [both panting]     
 [both breathing heavily]     
 [Nick grunting]     
 [both panting]     
 [Nick] I can't.     
 I can't.     
 Try.     
 [Unwomen coughing]     
 [aunt] Ten bags!     
 Keep going!     
 [aunts shouting indistinctly]     
 - [cattle prod buzzes] 
- [Unwoman moans]     
 [aunt Sarah] Back to work.     
 The Lord is my master.     
 He is my strength and my sustenance.     
 Not here.     
 Here, you fill    bags or you don't eat.     
 He is everywhere.     
 [aunt Sarah] Back to work.     
 - [cattle prod buzzes] 
- [exclaims]     
 [aunt Sarah] Don't be sloppy.     
 Get back to work!     
 [water running]     
 [Unwomen coughing]     
 Not so hard.     
 I have to get the dirt out. I don't want to get an infection.     
 You will. All the water is contaminated.     
 It stings a lot, but it works.     
 It's just alcohol.     
 [Unwoman groaning]     
 Were you a doctor?     
 College professor.     
 Is that why they sent you here?     
 Wrap your hands when you work.     
 You want to keep the blisters from breaking until you can get some callouses.     
 [winces]     
 You should know that I was not in favor of the university purges.     
 They were outrageous.     
 Having an education doesn't make someone a criminal.     
 I had an MFA before the law changed.     
 In interior design.     
 Is that why they sent you here?     
 No.     
 I was weak.     
 I committed a sin of the flesh.     
 My husband was so busy with the Handmaid, he didn't even notice.     
 What happened to him?     
 I don't know.     
 Probably got promoted.     
 I fell in love.     
 Do you think that matters?     
 
 
 
 - To who? 
- To God.     
 I know it does.     
 If it was love, He will forgive me, He will protect me,     
 He will deliver me from this place.     
 He will.     
 Antibiotics.     
 Past their expiration date, but it's better than nothing.     
 That water is full of E. coli.     
 You are truly a lamb of God.     
 Two pills every four hours.     
 Emily?     
 Why are you doing this?     
 A Mistress was kind to me.     
 Once.

- [guard  ] Moving forward.     
 [announcer over PA system]  Passengers at Logan International Airport   
 are required to have valid documentation.   
 Please have ready to show...   
 [guard  ] You and you, step through.     
 [Oliver babbles]     
 - [Sylvia] Do you see the doggie? 
- [Oliver] No. No.     
 - [Sylvia] Do you see the doggie? 
- [Oliver] No.     
 - The dog? 
- Okay.     
 Multiple nationalities with...     
 - How old's the kid? 
- [Emily] Two.     
 Mine's six.     
 [ICE agent] Child under four years...     
 I'm sorry, these were just issued this afternoon.     
 There was a whole different set this morning.     
 Don't you love bureaucracy?     
 [Oliver fussing]     
 Okay. Who's the American?     
 I am.     
 So, the boy and his mother can go, but I'm afraid you'll need a Canadian visa.     
 You'll have to go to the embassy.     
 - The closest one is New York City. 
- [guard  ] Step out of line.     
 I called. They said it was fine as long as we traveled together.     
 - That's families. 
- [guard  ] Move this way.     
 We are a family.     
 I'm his mother, too. We're married.     
 Smart to bring this.     
 Okay...     
 [ICE agent] Yes. That'll help, for sure.     
 Is there a problem?     
 [ICE agent] You just need a border traffic bypass stamp.     
 You guys can meet her at the gate. It shouldn't take too long.     
 [ticket agent] Two boarding passes for Flight     .     
 And one conditional.     
 - Thank you. 
- [ticket agent] Next, please.     
 [Emily] Okay, sweetie, it's this way.     
 [announcer over PA system]  Welcome to Logan International Airport.   
 Please be patient   
 and respond to all instructions given to you by airport staff.   
 [Oliver] Oh, Mommy! Mommy!     
 You go ahead. Get a snack or something.     
 We'll come with. 
It's two hours until we board.     
 - Syl. 
- We're coming with you.

 Final boarding call for Flight      to Mexico City.   
 [Oliver fussing]     
 [ICE supervisor] Sir, are you a Canadian citizen?     
 [ICE supervisor] You're the one who gave birth to the child?     
 Yes.     
 Was it your egg or an implanted embryo?     
 Why is that any of your business?     
 Ma'am, this'll go a lot faster if you cooperate.     
 Em, please...     
 I'm trying to cooperate. It's just we're going to miss our flight.     
 [ICE supervisor] You should probably just send them on ahead.     
 We're staying together.     
 [Oliver fussing]     
 Well, you're certainly not going to Montreal with them today, miss.     
 I spoke to the agent outside.     
 We're married.     
 He said it was fine.     
 Here.     
 [ICE supervisor] This is not valid.     
 It has the stamp.     
 [ICE supervisor] No. The document is no longer recognized.     
 You are not married.     
 [Oliver babbling]     
 - What? 
- [ICE supervisor] It's forbidden.     
 - Forbidden? 
- What does that mean?     
 [ICE supervisor] Forbidden by the law.     
 What law?     
 The  law.     
 You can't do this.     
 [ICE supervisor] Miss, sit down.     
 I want to speak to your supervisor, and I need to see a lawyer right...     
 Was it your egg or an implanted embryo?     
 [inaudible]     
 [Mrs. O'Conner coughing]     
 [gasping]     
 [groans]     
 How are you feeling?     
 [moans] Oh, so sick.     
 I didn't think I would get sick so fast.     
 It hurts. Hurts.     
 [Emily] I know.     
 Have faith in His mercy.     
 He is the redeemer.     
 He is the deliverer.     
 Did you take your pills?     
 I don't think they're working.     
 [crying]     
 What did you do?     
 What did you give me?     
 God will save me.     
 God will save me.     
 You will suffer.     
 You will suffer.     
 You will burn in agony for all eternity.     
 Every month, you held a woman down while your husband raped her.     
 Some things can't be forgiven.     
 It'll take a few more hours.     
 You're a monster.     
 f*cking...     
 - f*cking monster.

 [sobbing]     
 Emily.     
 Emily.     
 Oh, pray with me.     
 Pray with me.     
 You should die alone.     
 [distorted] There will be consequences!     
 [bell tolling]     
 [aunt Sarah] Get your tools!     
 Janine.     
 Hi.     
 Hi!     
 Hi.     
 [aunt Sarah] Move!     
 Move! Let's go!     
 [laughter on TV]     
 Everybody knows the basic erogenous zones.   
 You got one, two, three,   
 four,   
 five, six and seven.   
 [Chandler]  There are seven?   
 [laughter]     
 [Rachel]  Let me see that.   
 Oh, yeah.   
 [laughter]     
 [Chandler]  That's one?   
 [Monica scoffs]  Kind of   an important one.   
 [laughter]     
 [Chandler]  Oh, you know...   You know what?   
 I was looking at it upside down.   
 [laughter]     
 [Rachel]  Ah, well, you know,   sometimes that helps.   
 [laughter]     
 [Monica]  Okay, now, most guys would hit, um...   
 one, two, three, and then go to...   
 [video stops]     
 God, by whose mercy the faithful departed have found rest, please send Your Holy Angel to watch over this place.     
 Through Christ our Lord.     
 Amen.

 The DH is ready to celebrate.   
 And so are these fans.

- [spectators cheering loudly]     
 It hasn't happened at Fenway Park for    years!
