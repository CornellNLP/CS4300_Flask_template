 - (BABY CRIES) 
- OFFRED: Previously on The Handmaid's Tale...   
 A fine and healthy girl.   
 (LAUGHS)   
 - Do you have a name? 
- Angela.   
 SERENA JOY: Angela. She's just perfect.   
 - You can join us. 
- What do you mean, "us"?   
 There's a network. Waterford is important.   
 OFGLEN:  He's very high up.   
 NICK:  You need to be careful.   
 With her... Ofglen.    
 She's my partner. We shop together.    
 Don't get too close to her. 
It's dangerous.    
 OFGLEN: Trusting anyone is dangerous.    
 Especially a carpet-munching gender traitor.    
 I'd like to play a game with you.    
 - A game? 
- WATERFORD:  Yes.   
 Then we'll have to have a rematch.   
 I'm out of town next week, but when I get back?    
 OFFRED:  Ofglen.   
 I can tell her that the Commander is going to Washington.   
 f*ck.   
 (LOCK OPENING)    
 (KEYS RATTLING)    
 OFFRED:  I've heard pieces of the story from Rita.   
 The Marthas have their own networks.   
 There was a black van. Then footsteps on the stairs.   
 Then something quick and brutal   
 that made her unable to scream.   
 There'd be no mercies for a member of the Resistance.   
 She left nothing behind.   
 No footprints. No breadcrumbs.   
 I didn't even know her name.   
 (DOOR CLANKS OPEN)    
 Ofglen is gone.   
 (INDISTINCT RADIO CHATTER)    
 OFFRED:  Now I'm awake to the world.   
 I was asleep before.   
 That's how we let it happen.   
 When they slaughtered Congress, we didn't wake up.   
 When they blamed terrorists   
 and suspended the Constitution,   
 we didn't wake up then either.   
 They said it would be temporary.   
 Nothing changes instantaneously.   
 In a gradually heating bathtub   
 you'd be boiled to death before you knew it.   
 (BOTH PANTING)    
 Stop. Jeez. You want to kill me.    
 Good for you.    
 Good for... Look. It's not good for me.    
 Red wine is good for me.    
 Odette told me if you get any fatter, she's gonna kick you out.    
 - She did not. 
- Yeah, she said that.    
 - No, she didn't. 
- She did.    
 (LAUGHS) No, give me a cap.    
 Hey. Can I get a medium drip with a shot    
 and a tall non-fat cap.    
 - Medium and a small. 
- Yes.    
  .  .    
 - Is Claire sick? 
- Who?    
 The woman who usually works here.    
 How would I know?    
 (MACHINE TWITTERS)    
 Sorry. Declined.    
 - Really? 
- Yeah. Insufficient funds.    
 That's not possible.    
 I just deposited my paycheck yesterday, so...    
 Do you have any cash?    
 - What? No, what's up? 
- Can you just run it again?    
 Could you come back when you have some money?    
 Excuse...    
 Hey, man, what's your problem? 
Just run her card again.    
 OFFRED: I'll just call from work.    
 - What's your problem? 
- What?    
 f*cking sluts. Get the f*ck out of here.    
 - What did you just say? 
- (LAUGHS) Excuse me?    
 - Did you just call us f*cking sluts? 
- Are you serious, dude?    
 This your first day or something? 
What's your name?    
 - Unbelievable. 
- What's your name, bro?    
 - Get out of here. 
- Come on. Let's go.    
 Let's go. Come on. 
He's not worth it. Go.    
 No, your coffee f*cking sucks ass.    
 - What's your problem, man? 
- Fucker.    
 AUTOMATED MALE VOICE:  Thank you for your patience.   
 Due to unexpectedly high call volume,   
 we are experiencing longer than average wait times.   
 If you would like to continue to hold, please press or say "One."   
 - One. 
 - Thank you.   
 A customer care representative will be with you shortly.   
 Frickin' liars.    
 - (SIGHS) 
- (MUSIC ON HOLD PLAYING)    
 (INDISTINCT RADIO CHATTER)    
 (TELEPHONE RINGING)    
 Roger called a meeting.    
 Do you know who these guys are?    
 Are they with Building Security or something?    
 I don't know. I don't think so.    
 What's this meeting about?     
 I have no idea.     
 (INDISTINCT CONVERSATION)     
 ROGER: Folks.     
 Ladies and gentlemen.     
 Folks, may I have your attention, please.     
 Ladies, you should all know that I feel really sorry about this.     
 Oh, sh1t.     
 ROGER: It isn't my decision. I don't have a choice.     
 - I have to let you go. 
- WOMAN: What?     
 ROGER: I have to let you all go.     
 Wait, we're being fired?     
 ROGER: No, no, not fired. No.     
 - Let go. 
- What does that even mean?     
 ROGER: You can't work here anymore.     
 It's the law now.     
 Roger, what law?     
 ROGER: (STUTTERS) I don't have a choice.     
 They gave me    minutes.     
 Please, just, just pack up your things.     
 (INDISTINCT MURMURING)     
 Hey, why is it just the women?     
 - I don't have a choice. 
- Roger, Roger!     
 (INDISTINCT CONVERSATION)     
 - Thank you. 
- Under His eye.     
 Excuse me?     
 Why'd they send the army?     
 LENORE: I don't think that's the army.     
 I think it's another kind of army.     
 No. No, no, no, no. I'll take that.     
 I've got your lunch all ready.     
 Go ahead, sit.     
 It's good.     
 Oh.     
 I have stewed apples for dessert.     
 Do you like stewed apples?     
 - Thank you. 
- You are welcome.     
 I even found some cinnamon.     
 I swapped for it.     
 I gave her a lot of cheese.     
 It's nice.     
 Oh.     
 I don't want to forget this.     
 OFFRED:  f*ck.   
 A rose is a rose, except here.   
 Here it has to mean something.   
 It's beautiful.     
 Mrs. Waterford cut it special.     
 - She picked it for me? 
- Hmm. For good luck, I'm sure.     
 We're all so hopeful.     
 Hopeful?     
 You haven't asked for your napkins yet this month.     
 And I know you're just a few days late, but a baby?     
 - (DOOR OPENS) 
- Wouldn't it be wonderful?     
 - (DOOR CLOSES) 
- (SERENA JOY CLEARS THROAT)     
 Blessed day, Offred. How was your walk?     
 - Very pleasant, thank you. 
- How do you feel?     
 I'm... I'm fine.     
 You're not nauseous? Are your breasts tender at all?     
 No, not that I've noticed.     
 - It'd be too early for any of that. 
- Yeah.     
 Is the Putnam's cake ready?     
 Yes, ma'am. I just need to wrap it up.     
 Well, it isn't ready then, is it?     
 No, ma'am.     
 I'm going to have a visit with baby Angela today.     
 Would you like to come along?     
 It would be nice to have a change of scenery, don't you think?     
 Yes, I...     
 I'd like that very much, Mrs. Waterford.     
 Good.     
 Well, I'll get myself cleaned up.     
 You finish your lunch. Every bite, now.     
 You need to be in the clean-plate club.     
 (CHUCKLES)     
 Oh, she's such an angel.     
 (CHUCKLES)     
 She's already gained two pounds.     
 It's very important.     
 LEAH: You look really comfortable like that, Serena.     
 (CHUCKLES)     
 Offred...     
 (BABY COOS)     
 Would you like to hold her?     
 Here she is.     
 - (BABY COOS) 
- (SHUSHES)     
 CAROLINE: Do you think that's a good idea?     
 - (SHUSHES) 
- Offred knows. She's done it before.     
 (SIGHS) Isn't she beautiful?     
 (WHISPERS) Hello.     
 - CAROLINE: If you don't mind. 
- SERENA JOY: Of course.     
 Oh, there we go.     
 Yes, let's get you over here.     
 NAOMI: I'm sorry, I'm 
sure you're all starving.     
 We've just been enjoying our time with your beautiful baby.     
 Oh, put the cookies on the table.     
 Oh, she's enjoyable now. But...     
 In the middle of the night, not so much.     
 I don't think I'd survive without my coffee.     
 What happened to your hand?     
 Oh, it's nothing. Just one of those things.     
 Angela had finished her breakfast,     
 and I was picking her up.     
 And that girl, that ungrateful girl, she snapped at me.     
 - She bit you? 
- Mmm-hmm.     
 You know how they get.     
 I'm just counting the days until Angela's weaned     
 and that girl is out of my house.     
 Hmm.     
 - (BABY COOS) 
- (BELL TOLLING)     
 - Oh, hi! 
- OFFRED: Hey.     
 Did you see my baby? 
Isn't she beautiful?     
 - OFFRED: She's so beautiful. 
- Yeah.     
 Yeah.     
 How are you doing?     
 Oh, I was... I was so worried     
 that she would look like her father.     
 - Caleb looked like his father. 
- Mmm.     
 (SHAKILY) But she does... She looks...     
 - She looks like me. Yeah. 
- Mmm-hmm.     
 Janine, did you... Did you bite Mrs. Putnam?     
 You can't do that.     
 Well, she is a c**t.     
 - Well, you can't... 
- No, you don't understand.     
 She is always grabbing Charlotte.     
 She's always just grabbing at her.     
 And I told her I was still feeding her,     
 she wasn't done eating, and she just grabbed her from me.     
 Charlotte?     
 Oh, yeah. That's her real name.     
 Janine, you cannot bite people.     
 Can I tell you a secret?     
 Mmm-hmm.     
 (SOFTLY) I can do anything I want.     
 I can.     
 I had a baby. A good one!     
 I had a good one!     
 And so they don't care.     
 I can do anything I want. 
I can have ice cream.     
 (CHUCKLES)     
 It's only vanilla, but I can have it.     
 Oh, would you like some?     
 - Sure. I would love some ice cream. 
- Yes!     
 Yay! Okay! Let's go, let's go.     
 - (WHISPERS) Can I tell you another secret? 
- Mmm-hmm.     
 Um...     
 You can't tell anyone, okay?     
 Okay.     
 Okay.     
 He...     
 He loves me. (LAUGHS)     
 He loves me so much. (GIGGLES)     
 Who?     
 (WHISPERS) Him. My Commander.     
 - He loves you? 
- Yes!     
 He loves me and he loves Charlotte.     
 And...     
 We are going to run away together.     
 (LAUGHS)     
 He said that?     
 You don't have to believe me.     
 But, yes, he loves me.     
 We're going...     
 We're gonna be a real family.     
 Ice cream! Let's go.     
 - Car's on its way, ma'am. 
- Thank you. We'll wait.     
 Did you have fun?     
 Yes.     
 Thank you.     
 Did you get a chance to visit with your friend?     
 I'm sorry. I should've asked permission.     
 It's fine.     
 I imagine you two have a lot to talk about these days.     
 (BABY CRYING)     
 Did Ofwarren seem well?     
 Yes.     
 But I'm afraid she might be losing touch.     
 Well, that can happen sometimes...     
 With the weaker girls.     
 You know, what you do,     
 what we do together is so terrible...     
 It's terribly hard, and we must remain strong.     
 Which is why I feel so blessed to have you.     
 (BABY CONTINUES CRYING)     
 Why don't you go on and tell Nick     
 I'll have Mrs. Putnam's driver take me home.     
 I think Naomi could use some help.     
 Yes, Mrs. Waterford.     
 Have you seen the Putnam's baby?     
 She's really cute.     
 I love fat babies.     
 Do you know Ofglen's gone?     
 Hmm?     
 You said she was dangerous.     
 What'd you mean?     
 You need to remember a few things.     
 You can't change anything about this.     
 It's gonna end the same no matter what you do,     
 so there's no point trying to be tough or brave.     
 Brave isn't part of any of this.     
 Everybody breaks.     
 Everybody.     
 Nick.     
 What is this?     
 Tell them everything.     
 - Nick. 
- Whatever they want to know, just tell them.     
 (WHIMPERING)     
 NICK: I couldn't stop them.     
 I'm sorry.     
 Okay, I'll call Morgan...     
 - And you try the office again. 
- ODETTE: (OVER PHONE)  I'll call now.   
 - Okay. 
 - Come home soon.   
 - I love you. 
 - Love you too.   
 (SCOFFS)     
 It sounds like they just froze any account with an "F" on it instead of an "M."     
 I have $ ,    in that account.     
 They can't just take it.     
 MOIRA: Made it easy. All they needed to do was just push a few buttons.     
 Alyssa heard there's a new law.     
 Women can't own property anymore.     
 Wait, what?     
 - Are you f*cking serious? 
- Luke can use your account.     
 They'll transfer the money to him,     
 or that's what they're saying. Husband or male next of kin.     
 You know, they needed to do it this way.     
 All the bank accounts     
 and the jobs all at the same time.     
 Can you imagine the airports otherwise?     
 They don't want us leaving. You can bet on that.     
 (CHUCKLES) They can't just do this. 
They can't.     
 They can.     
 We've been under martial law since D.C.     
 Yeah, but that was about preventing another attack.     
 And it was about, you know, capturing terrorists.     
 Maybe there were never any terrorists.     
 Three books but she's down.     
 Hey, look, here's the f*cking problem.     
 Did we find out anything?     
 Not much.     
 There's a law.     
 Well, we found out we're boned.     
 Big surprise.     
 (SIGHS) I should get going.     
 We're pulling together a march for Thursday morning.     
 LUKE: We'll figure it out. 
This can't last.     
 Hey, you have all my money now.     
 So, congratulations. (LAUGHS)     
 Come on. You know I'll take care of you.     
 Christ. (LAUGHS)     
 Well, that's not what he's saying.     
 What? What's wrong?     
 - Nothing. It's just... 
- What?     
 - It sounds a little patronizing. 
- It is so f*cking patronizing.     
 Let's go. Bring it on. I wanna hear why I shouldn't take care of my wife.     
 - "My wife"? 
- Yeah.     
 - She doesn't belong to you. 
- That's right.     
 - Yeah. 
- No, no, no. She isn't your property.     
 And she doesn't need you to take care of her.     
 See, that's where all of this comes from.     
 You want to take care of us 'cause we're weak, right?     
 'Cause we're less than.     
 That's exactly... It's exactly what I'm saying.     
 - I'll take care of your money. 
- Yeah.     
 I'll take care of your body.     
 You really got a f*cking problem, you know that?     
 Should I just go in the kitchen and cut my dick off?     
 No, you should do that. And while you do it, take a video of it,     
 'cause the girls down at the collective will love watching that sh1t.     
 - They'll love it. 
- It's not for the collective.     
 - It's for you. You know that. 
- (LAUGHS)     
 Hey, Davis is closed. You're gonna have to take the train at Alewife.     
 sh1t.     
 You want me to walk you to the station?     
 f*ck, yeah. It's crazy out there.     
 Thanks, big, strong man.     
 Thank you. Big, strong f*ck.     
 OFFRED:  Please, God, I don't want pain.   
 I don't want to be a doll, hung on the wall.   
 I want to keep on living.   
 I'll do anything.   
 Resign my body freely to the uses of others.   
 I'll sacrifice. I'll repent.   
 I'll abdicate. I'll renounce...   
 - (ELECTRICITY CRACKLES) 
- (EXCLAIMS IN PAIN)     
 
 
 
 (GASPS)     
 I find these conversations are much more efficient     
 if we are all on the same page from the start.     
 Eyes up.     
 Good.     
 Offred, if you do your best to answer these questions,     
 this'll all be really painless. All right?     
 Yes, sir.     
 Good. That's what we all want.     
 Ofglen is your shopping partner, correct?     
 Yes, sir.     
 And you walked with the previous Handmaid assigned to that house?     
 - Yes. 
- You walked together every day?     
 Yes.     
 And what sorts of things would you and Ofglen talk about?     
 We talked about our shopping.     
 We talked about the weather.     
 You always walked directly to town     
 and then directly home?     
 Yes.     
 Sometimes we would stop at the wall to pray.     
 BURKE: Did you ever take the long way home,     
 walk by the river?     
 It's pretty by the river.     
 Yeah. It's nice. It's peaceful.     
 Private.     
 (PEN SCRATCHING)     
 What did you talk about when you walked by the river?     
 Shopping.     
 - And the weather. 
- Shopping and the weather.     
 Nothing else?     
 Nothing that I can remember.     
 Ofglen is quite a beautiful girl, isn't she?     
 She was very pleasant looking.     
 Mmm. In what way? Her hair? Her lips?     
 What part of her is so very pleasant?     
 I... I don't know. Just, um...     
 The whole package, I guess.     
 BURKE: So, on these walks, alone,     
 did you ever do anything more than talk?     
 Um, I'm sorry. I don't know what you mean.     
 BURKE: Apologies, Offred. This is, uh,     
 rather delicate territory.     
 Did she ever touch you?     
 (SCOFFS) No.     
 - Never. 
- Did she ever try?     
 No.     
 Did you know she was a gender traitor?     
 Yes.     
 BURKE: How did you know?     
 Because she mentioned her wife.     
 From before.     
 It was... It was in passing.     
 BURKE: In passing.     
 And you didn't report this to your Mistress?     
 I'm sorry, I didn't think about it.     
 You didn't think about it.     
 Did she ever tell you she was engaged in a relationship?     
 She ever talk about a Martha?     
 No.     
 But you knew what she was?     
 I knew she was gay.     
 - (GASPS) 
- (ELECTRICITY CRACKLES)     
 (PANTING AND GROANING)     
 That word is not to be used. Do you understand me?     
 Yes, Aunt Lydia.     
 That girl,     
 that thing,     
 was an offense to God.     
 She was a disgusting beast.     
 BURKE: Why didn't you report the conversation?     
 Because she was my friend.     
 Remember your scripture.     
 Blessed are the meek.     
 (EXHALES SHAKILY)     
 And blessed are those     
 who suffer for the cause of righteousness,     
 for theirs is the kingdom of Heaven.     
 I remember.

- (SCREAMS)     
 SERENA JOY: No! Stop!     
 Mrs. Waterford! This is state business...     
 No! She's pregnant!     
 (GASPING)     
 BURKE: Well, this is such wonderful news.     
 Congratulations on your blessed miracle.     
 We have all the information that we need.     
 Get out of my house.     
 It's okay.

 - JUDGE: We'll have order, please. 
- (GAVEL THUDS)     
 Mr. Gambel for the State?     
 GAMBEL: Yes, Your Honor.     
 The accused stand charged with gender treachery,     
 in violation of Romans, Chapter  , Verse   . By His word.     
 JUDGE: And do you swear by His name     
 that the report you have submitted is the truth entirely?     
 GAMBEL: Yes, I do so swear.     
 JUDGE: Then in the name of God     
 and His servants here on Earth,     
 the accused are hereby found guilty.     
 (GAVEL THUDS)     
 Martha        ,     
 you are hereby sentenced to the Common Mercy of the State.     
 And you, Handmaid     .     
 Your existence is an abomination.     
 True justice would see you sent     
 to an eternity of suffering.

 NICK: Can I come in?     
 Sure.     
 - Hi. 
- Hey.     
 I just wanted to check if you were okay.     
 I'm fine.     
 Thank you.     
 Except for the weird guy who just snuck into my room.     
 Other than that...     
 (CHUCKLES SOFTLY)     
 You're dripping.     
 I brought you some ice.     
 Thank you.     
 I wish... I should've...     
 I should've just driven away with you.

 SERENA JOY: This can go in the hall.     
 Offred, blessed day.     
 Please, come on up.     
 What do you think?     
 I know that we're still in such early stages.     
 But I've been wanting to clean this room out for quite some time,     
 and the light here is so beautiful in the morning.     
 And by His word,     
 all things are possible to him that believeth.     
 Mrs. Waterford...     
 I want to tell you something.     
 (SIGHS) Fred and I,     
 we tried for so long.     
 It was hard to keep faith     
 but here you are.     
 You're right here. You're my miracle.     
 My beautiful miracle.     
 Truly.     
 Mrs. Waterford, I'm not pregnant.     
 I got my period.     
 When?     
 Last night.     
 (GASPS)     
 SERENA JOY: You will stay here,     
 and you will not leave this room.     
 Do you understand me?     
 (YELLING) Do you understand me?     
 OFFRED: Yes, Mrs. Waterford.     
 Things can get much worse for you.

 The stitches will come out in a few days.     
 I know this is a shock for you, Emily.     
 You can still have children, of course.     
 But things will be so much easier for you now.     
 You won't want     
 what you cannot have.     
 Blessed be the fruit, dear.
