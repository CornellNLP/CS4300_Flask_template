 [narrator]  Previously on  The Handmaid's Tale...   
 [Nick]  Anything I can do   to help, Commander Pryce?   
 We are going to clean up Gilead, son.   
 [Glen] May I say that it's very sporting of you to have come, despite your handicap.   
 Cushing.   
 You're up.   
 [shot fired]   
 You have to sleep with Eden.    
 She's gonna report you. 
She will make trouble.    
 - [Nick] I can't. 
- Yes, you can.    
 Because I can't lose you. 
Do you hear me?    
 [Nick]  Commander Pryce.   
 I can't stay in that house anymore. Reassign me.    
 You have my word.    
 [Commander Fred]  May I present to you, the new Rachel and Leah Center.   
 It's not time yet. Tell her to go back.

 [siren blaring]    
 [Ofsamuel] I heard    commanders.    
 Thirty-one of us.    
 I didn't even know most of them.    
 Ofzev was really nice.    
 Ofedward was kind of a jerk, and she never washed her hair.    
 God rest her soul.    
 [helicopter whirring overhead]    
 Do you know Ofglen's name?    
 She was your shopping partner.    
 We never got that far.    
 [siren wailing]    
 Looks like the Eyes have been through here.    
 [indistinct voice over radio]    
 [machine beeping]    
 [Commander Fred] Serena.    
 [Serena in distorted voice] 
I'm right here.    
 [Commander Fred in distorted voice] 
There was an explosion.    
 Colonel Dennison, he's the security...    
 Everything is being taken care of. 
You just rest.    
 You rest and you get better.    
 [Nick] Mrs. Waterford?    
 Fred. Fred, Nick is here.    
 [breathing heavily]    
 [Serena] He's been in and out all morning.    
 The office sent those for him to sign, but he needs to focus on getting better.     
 [Nick] Of course.     
 I could take care of this.     
 Why don't I drive you home?     
 Get some sleep, a change of clothes.     
 Thank you. Maybe later.     
 [door opens]     
 [indistinct voice over radio]     
 I pray we aren't intruding.     
 No, of course not. Blessed day.     
 Mrs. Waterford, how are you holding up?     
 Do you need anything?     
 Just your prayers, thank you.     
 You have those, of course.     
 [Commander Putnam] 
We need to pass along some news.     
 Commander Pryce has gone home to God.     
 [Serena] May God grant him eternal rest.     
 [Commander Putnam] Yes. By His hand.     
 Did you know him well?     
 Not really. No.     
 He was a true man of God.     
 Commander Cushing will be taking on Pryce's security duties.     
 God saves his most difficult tests for the truly faithful.     
 I will find every person involved in this barbaric attack, and they will be punished.     
 I promise you that.     
 May God bless your work.     
 Mmm.     
 [door opens]     
 [indistinct voice over radio]     
 [door closes]     
 [horse whinnies]     
 [Aunt  ] Keep going!     
 [woman gasps]     
 [Aunt  ] Facing forward!     
 Keep going!     
 [sirens wailing]     
 [Aunt Pauline] Stop!     
 - What is this? 
- I don't know.     
 [indistinct voice over radio]     
 [Aunt Pauline] Stay in line!     
 [Aunt  ] Facing forward!     
 [indistinct voice over radio]     
 [Aunt  ] Facing forward!     
 - [Aunt Pauline] You, you! 
- [cattle prod buzzes]     
 [woman cries out]     
 [Aunt Pauline] You and you! 
Move! Get in the vehicle!     
 [cattle prod buzzes]     
 [woman cries out]     
 [Aunt  ] Keep moving!     
 [Aunt Pauline] You, you!     
 - [cattle prod buzzes] 
- [woman cries out]     
 - [Aunt Pauline] You! 
- [whimpers]     
 - You! 
- [cattle prod buzzes]     
 [Aunt Pauline] You!     
 [Aunt Pauline] Move! Let's go! Get in!     
 [whimpers]     
 - Where are we going? 
- Move!     
 [Janine gasps]     
 [siren buzzes]     
 [Aunt  ] Move! Let's go!     
 [Aunt  ] Keep walking!     
 [indistinct chatter]     
 [Rachel] Excuse me.     
 - [woman] Ma'am. 
- [man  ] My brother...     
 - [woman] Do you have any... 
- [woman  ] Excuse me.     
 - [man  ] Please! 
- [Rachel] Quiet, please.     
 My office can confirm that there has been a bombing in Gilead.     
 There are fatalities, including a number of high-level government officials.     
 Were any Handmaids killed?     
 We do have unconfirmed reports that fatalities are among civilians and, yes, Handmaids.     
 [crowd murmurs]     
 Right now, we don't have any more information.     
 As soon as we know more, we'll let you know. I promise.     
 [overlapping conversation]     
 Please, go home.     
 [Moira] Luke, hey. Where're you going?     
 Home. I'm gonna get dinner. 
You okay with roti?     
 You don't want to know that she's okay?     
 She's not okay.     
 She's alive. Have faith that she's alive.     
 That's not knowing.     
 See you at home.     
 [June] Holy sh1t. That is insane.     
 Two hundred and fifty thousand dollars?     
 [exhales] Yup. For a healthy baby.     
 Jesus.     
 - Coffee is on me, forever. 
- Yeah.     
 Look, I can pay off my student loans, and take a shot at that web-dev thing with Hollis.     
 Mmm-hmm.     
 Hey, if people want a baby, any chance they'll take this one?     
 How is she?     
 She is wearing me down, aren't you?     
 - Tiring. 
- Uh-huh.     
 Come. Come here.     
 - Want to come to Auntie, baby girl? 
- Come on.     
 - Come on. Hi, yeah. 
- Yeah. Yeah.     
 [baby gurgling]     
 Hey, you want a coffee or anything?     
 No, I'm all right. Thank you.     
 Hey, Hannah. Tell Daddy you love Auntie more than him.     
 - Don't you dare. 
- [June laughs]     
 [Luke] Don't you dare.     
 So, it's your egg?     
 Yeah. I met the couple. They're from England. They're nice.     
 [Hannah gurgling]     
 What?     
 You know, you might get attached to the little fucker.     
 That look, it'll be fine, okay?     
 You can worry about that, and I will worry about my giant pile of money.     
 [both giggle]     
 [Luke]  Scrooge McDuck that sh1t. 
Am I right, hmm?   
 Do you have a list? Do you have a list?     
 Sorry, we have no new information. Sorry.     
 [Moira] Excuse me. Hey. Hi. Excuse me.     
 - Moira. 
- Excuse me!     
 Excuse me! Please! 
I'm looking for somebody else.     
 My girlfriend. Fiancee.     
 She was rounded up before the war.     
 Okay. Okay.     
 - [man] Please. Ms Tapping! 
- [Moira] Thank you. Thank you.     
 - [woman] Ms. Tapping! 
- [Rachel] I'm sorry, folks.     
 We'll have more information soon, everyone.     
 [Moira] All of these?     
 The unidentified.     
 Most of them have a few details, where they died, identifying marks but no names yet.     
 What are those?     
 Those are the children.     
 [Odette]  Moira, just lean back and relax. 
This is cold.   
 - Oh, damn! 
- Told you.     
 Your baby is the size of a brussels sprout.     
 [Odette] Let's see what's going on in there.     
 Ha!     
 [ultrasound noise]     
 [fetal heartbeat]     
 Hello, little alien.     
 [June chuckles]     
 Don't you want to see?     
 I saw it.     
 [Odette] You can take a photo home.     
 - Yeah. 
- No, um, that's okay.     
 No, she's gonna take a photo. 
You're gonna take a photo.     
 - [Moira] Why? 
- To put it on your fridge.     
 You stick it on your fridge.     
 So, no photo then.     
 - No. 
- Okay.     
 Call if you need anything.     
 Here.     
 Thank you.     
 [door opens]     
 [door closes]     
 [slow piano music playing]     
 [footsteps approaching]     
 - [knocking] 
- [door opens]     
 [Offred] Hi.     
 There's someone here for you.     
 Blessed be the fruit.     
 Yes. May the Lord open.     
 Thank you, Martha. 
You must be very busy.     
 Sir?     
 Leave the room, please.     
 [sirens wailing in distance]     
 In Grace, I go.     
 Please.     
 Congratulations on your blessed miracle.     
 You're feeling well?     
 Yes, Sir.     
 Praise be.     
 Terrific.     
 Times like this, I wonder what type of world we're gonna leave the next generation.     
 For the sake of our children, we need to find those among us who wish to do us harm.     
 Do you understand?     
 Yes, Sir.     
 I'm afraid I didn't know Ofglen very well.     
 We only walked together for a brief time.     
 I imagine she didn't talk very much.     
 No.     
 [siren wailing]     
 But she always seemed very pious.     
 Well, I'm sorry I...     
 There's not more that I can help you with.     
 But surely you know who helped you try to leave Gilead. Don't you?     
 I don't understand.     
 When you ran away.     
 All that time you spent in hiding.     
 Who looked after you?     
 I didn't see them.     
 You didn't see them?     
 No.     
 Offred.     
 You can trust me.     
 Who helped you?     
 Commander Waterford?     
 I was taken against my will.     
 Our republic is under siege.     
 We do not have the luxury of fairy tales.     
 Sir...     
 I was taken... against my will.     
 Offred.     
 [suspenseful music playing]     
 If your house has been infected with terrorists, I need to know.     
 [dog barking]     
 [electronic buzzing]     
 [dog barking]     
 [siren approaching]     
 [breathing heavily]     
 [women scream]     
 [dogs barking]     
 [exhales]     
 [indistinct voice over radio]     
 [gasps]     
 [door opens]     
 [Serena] Praise be.     
 You're all right.     
 [machine beeping]     
 Yes, I'm fine.     
 Guardians shooting Marthas in the street, and it's supposed to make us feel safer?     
 It's asinine.     
 [Serena] Fred? 
Our baby is safe. It's here.     
 Come closer.     
 [Fred breathing heavily]     
 You're bigger.     
 [Fred breathing heavily]     
 The Commander needs his rest now.     
 [door unlocks]     
 [Guardian] He was, as of an hour ago, Sir.     
 - Blessed day. 
- [Nick] Blessed day.     
 Why don't you check on him again, and do another search of the grounds.     
 - Will do, Sir. 
- Thank you.     
 [indistinct voice over radio]     
 Are you okay?     
 Yeah.     
 I'm fine. Sorry.     
 They shot her, Nick.     
 I think she was just reaching for her pass, and they shot her.     
 She didn't even do anything.     
 She was... I mean, she was just bleeding and laying in the street.     
 - She didn't even do anything. 
- It's okay.     
 It's okay. It's over.     
 - [cries] 
- It's over.     
 [door opens]     
 [Guardian] It's all there.     
 [Nick sighs]     
 - [door closes] 
- [gasps]     
 Cushing, he's...     
 He wants to know who helped me.     
 When I ran.     
 He's not gonna give up, Nick.     
 - He's not gonna give up. 
- No.     
 No, he's not.     
 I'm not gonna let anything happen to you.     
 - Okay. 
- Okay.     
 What about you?     
 [siren wailing]     
 [door opens]     
 [footsteps approach]     
 [Offred] Blessed evening.     
 [Serena] Go to bed.     
 Baby needs rest.     
 Right now, the baby needs Twinkies, but we're compromising.     
 How is the Commander?     
 He's very strong.     
 [Offred] Praise be.     
 God will speed his recovery.     
 He needs to get back in the office.     
 Ray Cushing will be the death of us all.     
 - [opening bottle cap] 
- [siren wailing]     
 [Serena pouring alcohol]     
 We knew Ray and Sonia from before.     
 Commander Cushing.     
 We used to vacation together.     
 Went to Antigua once.     
 They had the most amazing beaches.     
 Picked up some sea glass.     
 Ray was a blowhard even then.     
 Now, he's the big man.     
 It doesn't suit him.     
 He came here, to talk to me.     
 He doesn't believe that I was taken against my will.     
 You need to answer his questions very carefully.     
 Make sure that he understands the truth.     
 They executed Commander Deeds, and his whole household.     
 For what Ofglen did.     
 Ofglen was a terrorist.     
 Commander Cushing would do the same to any house connected to the Underground.     
 And there's no way he'd leave a baby to grow up in that house.     
 Fred would never allow that.     
 He isn't here...     
 Serena.     
 [door opens]     
 [door closes]     
 [Moira] Hey.     
 Tikka masala.     
 Thanks.     
 I'm not really hungry.     
 Yeah. It's good cold.     
 You don't have to do this to yourself.     
 Odette wouldn't want you to.     
 It's time, okay?     
 I just want to know if she was alone when she died.     
 What if I don't find her?     
 Welcome to my world.     
 That pathetic land of bad hats and hipster scruff?     
 [Luke chuckles]     
 f*ck that. [chuckles]     
 Thanks for the food.     
 Uh-huh. You're welcome.     
 [door opens]     
 [door closes]     
 [inhales]     
 [Odette] Two, three, four...     
 And breathe out.     
 [all exhale]     
 Two, three, four, five.     
 Deeper, Moira. From the diaphragm.     
 Yeah, from your f*cking diaphragm.     
 Shh, it works.     
 Can you get your knee is like in my back.     
 - Sorry. 
- Thank you.     
 [Odette] Okay. Take one last deep, cleansing breath.     
 [class inhales and exhales]     
 Release any tension.     
 Good. Good.     
 That's it for tonight, everyone.     
 Thank you.     
 Oh, don't forget to sign up for parenting classes.     
 Babies don't come with an instruction manual.     
 - Thank you. Okay. 
- There we go.     
 You doing okay?     
 Good.     
 I'm exhausted.     
 I'm a f*cking exhausted,     
 constipated whale.     
 Yep.     
 You know, my feet got so swollen, I had to wear orthopedic shoes.     
 Mm-hmm.     
 Ugh, I couldn't even walk.     
 Luke had to rub my feet every night.     
 - You gotta be kidding me. 
- What?     
 Well, you're f*cking throwing Luke in my face.     
 Excuse me?     
 When do I do that? 
What does it even mean?     
 Your perfect marriage?     
 Like those f*cking assholes?     
 [sighs]     
 
 
 
 Get over here. Come over here.     
 What?     
 There's not a perfect marriage.     
 It's the same guy every night.     
 Even when you're sick of each other.     
 Even when he can never seem to figure out how to load the f*cking dishwasher.     
 Do you know why?     
 Because he's an infant.     
 Who wants that?     
 Not me.     
 Blech.     
 Perfect marriage. Insane.     
 I'm sorry.     
 It's fine.     
 You had to wear orthopedic shoes?     
 Yeah.     
 - That's hot. 
- Yeah, you're gonna love 'em.     
 [helicopter blade whirring]     
 [indistinct voice over radio]     
 [Nick] Blessed evening.     
 [Guardian] Copy that.     
 [indistinct radio chatter]     
 [Nick] Hey.     
 Stay in your patrol zones. And watch the streets.     
 [sirens wailing in distance]     
 [dog barking]     
 [helicopter whirring overhead]     
 [Serena] Blessed evening.     
 [Nick] Blessed evening.     
 Where's Eden?     
 She went with Rita to call on the Websters.     
 After what happened to their Martha, I suggested it might be a nice thing to do.     
 Nick, have you ever helped the Commander submit warrants to the Consular of Divine Law?     
 Yes, Ma'am.     
 Those documents need the Commander's signature.     
 I know the Commander will forgive my trespasses.     
 Will you walk me through the process?     
 [Gavin chortling]     
 You see?     
 Is that funny?     
 Is that funny?     
 You ready for this?     
 Yup.     
 Hey.     
 Go with God, little man.     
 - [June] Bye, Gavin. 
- [Gavin starts crying]     
 Nice to meet you.     
 [Gavin fussing]     
 [exhales]     
 [indistinct conversations]     
 [June] I forget how small they are.     
 - [Gavin cries] 
- Bullshit. I'm still sitting on ice.     
 It'll get better.     
 Sometimes you will pee a little when you laugh.     
 Okay, shut up, please.     
 [Gavin cries]     
 You okay?     
 Great.     
 It's weird to be alone.     
 [Moira]  Hey.   
 Moira. Hi.     
 - Hi. 
- Hi.     
 - Uh... 
- How are you feeling?     
 Um, oh, I feel great.     
 You know, I thought I was never going to have s*x again, but, everything is shaping up down there, thank God.     
 - [both chuckle] 
- I'm sorry.     
 The Watsons moved back to England.     
 Oh, yeah.     
 They sent me a card on Gavin's six-month birthday.     
 It was really nice.     
 Hey, you happen to know anything about Malbecs?     
 Um...     
 Yes! I'm gonna go with yes.     
 Come here.     
 Um...     
 - This one. 
- The first one you saw?     
 Yes. I'm usually more of a white wine girl.     
 Gross.     
 [Odette laughs] okay.     
 Um...     
 I was supposed to be at June and Luke's like    minutes ago.     
 Oh.     
 Ah...     
 Thanks for the recommendation, Doc.     
 Um, you're not my patient anymore.     
 You can call me Odette.     
 Okay.     
 Thanks, Odette.     
 [Odette laughs]     
 [Moira]  Thank you.   
 [whimpering]     
 [sobbing softly]

 [siren approaching]     
 What is this? Who authorized this?     
 Get your hands up!     
 [sirens approach]     
 [Cushing] Who authorized this? 
I'm speaking to you.     
 [indistinct voice over radio]     
 Warren, what the hell is going on here?     
 Ray Cushing, by order of Commander Waterford, you have been stripped of your command, and charged with apostasy and treason.     
 That's ridiculous, Warren.     
 You have aided terrorists and conspired to undermine our Divine Republic.     
 The evidence submitted by the Eyes, is overwhelming.

 [Handmaid] Just a half a pound, please.     
 Such a bounty. I'm gonna make lemon chicken tonight.     
 Praise be.     
 Maybe with green beans and garlic.     
 - Hi! 
- Oh! Jeez!     
 [giggles]     
 [Offred] Jesus Christ!     
 Hi!     
 How are you... How are you here?     
 I guess there were so few Handmaids left after the bombing, they brought some of us back from the Colonies.     
 - Isn't that nice? 
- My God, yeah.     
 God saved us.     
 He has a plan.     
 He has a plan for both of us.     
 Well, it might not be the same plan, it could be different plans, but...     
 [both laugh]     
 - It's good to see you. 
- Mmm.     
 [Handmaid] Praise be.

 Our sources inside Gilead have confirmed the names of the women killed in the attack.     
 The families have been notified, and they have our deepest sympathies.     
 These are the deceased.     
 Jennifer Briggs.

 Offred.     
 Come with me, please.     
 Commander Cushing turned our streets into a war zone.     
 These are drafts of new security orders.     
 From the Commander?     
 They'll remove the additional checkpoints, and start scaling down the Guardian presence.     
 It's about time things started getting back to normal around here.     
 Don't you think?     
 Uh, yes, Mrs. Waterford.     
 You're an editor, is that right?     
 I used to be.     
 Good.     
 Read over these for me.     
 [footsteps retracting]     
 I'll need a pen.
