 [NARRATOR]  Previously   on The Handmaid's Tale...   
 Fred. Everything is being taken care of. You just rest.   
 [NICK] What are you doing?   
 [OFFRED] Not allowed to have these.   
 [SERENA] Nick, have you ever helped the Commander submit warrants to the Consular of Divine Law?   
 [NICK] Yes, Ma'am. Those documents need the Commander's signature.   
 [SERENA] I know the Commander will forgive my trespasses.   
 - [JANINE] Hi! [JANINE GIGGLES] 
- [OFFRED] Oh! Jeez!    
 Jesus. How are you here?    
 There were so few Handmaids left after the bombing, they brought some of us back from the Colonies.    
 Isn't that nice? [LAUGHS]    
 [SERENA] Commander Cushing turned our streets into a war zone.    
 These are drafts of new security orders.    
 You're an editor. 
Read over these for me.    
 I'll need a pen.    
 [PEN CLICKS]    
 ["EASY" PLAYING]    
 [OFFRED]  We do our work in the evening.   
 She writes, I read.   
 This is the new normal.   
 And an offense to God.   
 In another life, maybe we could've been colleagues.   
 And in this one, we're heretics.   
 I was already on the naughty list.   
 An adulteress, a "fallen woman," as Aunt Lydia used to say.   
 But this is new territory for Serena, I think.   
 How does she feel about falling?   
 She seems pretty happy.   
 Do you miss working?    
 It's a small sacrifice to make to be welcomed back into God's grace.    
 I do truly detest knitting.    
 To be frank.    
 You're really a good writer.    
 Thank you.    
 I won't forget your help.    
 [SERENA] How's it look?    
 [OFFRED] Good. Better.    
 I think you can still swap these two paragraphs and, I don't know, you can adjust the opening if you want.    
 Otherwise, it's ready to go to the hospital in the morning.    
 That won't be necessary. The Commander can read it here.    
 He's coming home tomorrow.    
 Praise be.    
 Praise be.    
 [INDISTINCT RADIO CHATTER]    
 [GASP OF PAIN]    
 [SIGHS]    
 [DOOR CLOSES]    
 [COMMANDER FRED] It's beautiful.    
 When you see it every day, you forget.    
 The Lord has truly blessed us.    
 [SERENA] Rita, did you pick up the heirloom russets?    
 [RITA] Yes, Ma'am. 
They're already baking.    
 [SERENA] Don't overbake them again.    
 Offred.    
 [SINISTER MUSIC PLAYING]    
 [COMMANDER FRED] Well, well, well.    
 What an unexpected welcome.    
 Blessed day to you all.    
 Blessed day. We're all very glad to have you back.    
 [RITA] Welcome home, Sir.    
 [COMMANDER FRED] 
Rita, I did miss your cooking.    
 Thank you, Sir. I'm making all your favorites.    
 [EDEN] Commander Waterford, I made this for you.    
 From me and Nick.    
 [COMMANDER FRED] This is lovely.    
 From the happy couple. Thank you both.    
 Our... divine miracle.    
 Glad to see you looking so... healthy.    
 We are all grateful for your recovery.    
 Praise be.    
 I'm ready to take on the world again.    
 Let's get you settled, then.    
 Do you think he liked the present?    
 I'm sure he loved it.    
 Everything is just as you left it.    
 Today's work, and tomorrow's schedule.    
 Essential meetings only. I had Nick postpone the rest.    
 There's no need to jump right back into it.    
 You've taken so many risks for me.    
 I can't thank you enough.    
 Now, I'm...sure you'll be glad that things are back to normal.    
 I also left a first draft of your agenda for the Canadian trip, for your presentation to the committee.    
 [COMMANDER FRED] I'll take a look.    
 [FOOTSTEPS RECEDING]    
 [DOOR CREAKING]    
 [CLASP CLICKING]    
 [MUSIC BOX PLAYING]    
 It was nice working with you, too.    
 [DOOR SLAMS SHUT]    
 - Hey. 
- Hi.    
 Mrs. Waterford must be so relieved that the Commander's back home.     
 [NICK] Uh-huh.     
 You won't have to spend so much time going to the hospital now.     
 Yeah, no. I'll be a lot busier now he's back.     
 I understand.     
 Here.     
 Thanks.     
 You're welcome.     
 I was thinking maybe I could spruce up our house and make it homier?     
 Sounds good.     
 [EDEN] What colors do you like?     
 I like yellow.     
 It's so bright and cheery.     
 My mother says, "happy home, happy husband."     
 [SNORTS]     
 Whatever you want.     
 Praise be.     
 Uh-huh.     
 [RITA] Oh, and get more honey.     
 Eden borrowed it.     
 Doubt I'll ever see it again.     
 - [OFFRED] She's trying. 
- Yeah, she is.     
 - [FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING] 
- God give me strength.     
 Is everything all right, Mrs. Waterford?     
 Yes, fine.     
 Baby Angela isn't well.     
 Probably just fighting off a cold, but...     
 Naomi could use the support.     
 Well, I will keep the... family in my prayers.     
 [INDISTINCT RADIO CHATTER]     
 [JANINE] Hi!     
 Um...     
 Blessed be the fruit.     
 May the Force be with you. [LAUGHS]     
 [OFFRED LAUGHS]     
 How are you feeling?     
 - I'm fine. 
- Yeah?     
 Well, you'll probably get to the cool part soon.     
 The baby's foot pushes out of your stomach like in  Alien .     
 Charlotte used to do that all the time.     
 - [SIRENS APPROACHING] 
- [INDISTINCT RADIO CHATTER]     
 You haven't seen  Alien ?     
 No, I just thought the sequel was better.     
 You're nuts.     
 [MALE VOICE OVER LOUDSPEAKER] 
 Blessed day. We have citrus.   
 [INDISTINCT RADIO CHATTER]     
 This is the last week for wheat bread for this season.   
 Last week for wheat bread.   
 So, Fred's back?     
 Praised be His mercy.     
 Thank God you're pregnant.     
 My posting's great.     
 It's just the Ceremony.     
 No blow jobs.     
 Seriously, it's like a blessing from God.     
 [EMILY] Being raped is not a blessing.     
 [ALMA] Shh.     
 [EMILY] f*ck him! The real blessing was that bomb.     
 Anyone helping Gilead deserves to be blown apart.     
 [OFFRED]  If Emily knew that I helped   
 cover for the Commander with Serena,   
 would she want me dead, too?   
 I can't say I blame her.   
 Stay in Gilead long enough and it starts to eat you   
 from the inside out.   
 That's one of the things they do.   
 They force you to kill, within yourself.   
 [AMBULANCE SIREN WAILING]     
 [HANDMAID  ] Oh, no. Dear God, no.     
 [HANDMAID  ] This the baby ambulance.     
 [HANDMAID  ] It's the baby ambulance.     
 [HANDMAID  ] Whose baby is sick?     
 [INDISTINCT MURMURING]     
 [OFFERIC] I heard it's Angela.     
 The Putnams.     
 What?     
 [OFFERIC] My Martha said.     
 Well, your Martha's wrong!     
 - It's not Charlotte. 
- Hey, hey.     
 It's okay. We should just pray for whoever's baby it is, right?     
 Yeah.     
 - Come on. 
- Yeah.     
 It's all right.     
 [HANDMAID] Let us pray.     
 [JANINE] Why... why would they say that about Charlotte?     
 Why... why would she say that? I know it isn't her.     
 - Get back! 
- It's okay. I've got her.     
 She's fine. Come on.     
 She's fine. Calm down.     
 I just don't understand why they would say something like that about her.     
 - Okay, come here. 
- It's not her. She's not sick.     
 Come here, I'm gonna tell you, okay? But I need you to stay calm.     
 Mrs. Waterford went to the Putnam house this morning.     
 The baby is not doing well.     
 - Oh, God! 
- But I don't know how serious it is.     
 - Why didn't you say anything? 
- Because I didn't want to upset you.     
 What's going on? 
What's happening to her?     
 She's fine! I've got her!     
 - Janine, I need you to calm down! 
- Don't tell me to calm down!     
 I will find out! Okay?     
 I will find out what's happening!     
 I promise.     
 Okay?     
 Okay.     
 Okay.     
 [INDISTINCT RADIO CHATTER]     
 I need to see her.     
 Janine, you know that can't happen.     
 You sound just like one of them.     
 f*ck.     
 [MUSIC BOX PLAYING]     
 [KNOCKING AT DOOR]     
 [SERENA] Good. I'm glad you found that.     
 Thank you.     
 And thank you for the flower.     
 How's Baby Angela?     
 Not so well.     
 They don't know what's wrong with her.     
 They're doing everything that they can, but she's getting worse.     
 I'm so sorry.     
 There's nothing they can do?     
 Well, there might be something that could help.     
 It would mean bending the law.     
 I'm not sure that Gilead is exploring every doctor available to them.     
 I see.     
 What do you think?     
 Well, I think, if it were my baby, I would do whatever I could.     
 Law or no law.     
 [DOOR OPENING]     
 [SERENA] Some tea?     
 How kind.     
 I'm sorry I wasn't more available on your first day home.     
 Oh, no need to apologize.     
 I managed quite well, actually.     
 That must feel good.     
 Yes, and tomorrow will be even better.     
 I wish I could say the same for Baby Angela.     
 But there is hope.     
 God has blessed Gilead with one of the top neonatologists in the world.     
 That's excellent.     
 How soon can he get here?     
 He is a she.     
 Now serving as a Martha.     
 If you gave her a temporary transfer for a day, she could examine Angela.     
 Give her opinion.     
 No one has to know.     
 [SPOON CLINKING AGAINST CUP]     
 I'm sure our physicians are capable.     
 Fred.     
 We cannot question the will of God.     
 He said no? Why?     
 Because that is his decision.     
 The best we can do now is pray for Baby Angela, and for the parents.     
 [OFFRED SIGHS]     
 God, I can't imagine how they feel.     
 To face the loss of a child.     
 Their former Handmaid knows the baby's sick.     
 She's freaking out.     
 Oh, you mean the Handmaid who nearly killed her?     
 She was desperate.     
 She loves her.     
 So much.     
 Then let her pray.     
 She already is.     
 Do you think, Mrs. Waterford, that she could see the baby?     
 I would be there.     
 I would make sure nothing happened.     
 Don't be stupid.     
 [PAPER RUSTLING]     
 [OBJECTS CLATTERING]     
 What if it's Janine's last chance?     
 That horrid girl?     
 You want me to let her see my child?     
 That child is a gift, by God's grace, that she gave you.     
 What's going on?     
 That Handmaid.     
 I was hoping that you would find it in your heart to let her see your child.     
 She brings only love.     
 [COMMANDER PUTNAM] I think God would want us to welcome her.     
 Warren.     
 What harm could it do?     
 [ELEVATOR DINGS]     
 Where is she?     
 Mrs. Waterford is talking to Mrs. Putnam.     
 Well, they have to let me see her. They're gonna let me see her.     
 - They have to! 
- Janine. Dear.     
 Why don't you sit?     
 There is a reason Handmaids are not told when a child is sick.     
 It's far too upsetting.     
 She heard the rumors.     
 And you took it upon yourself to confirm them.     
 I think after everything she has been through, she deserves that.     
 Some honesty at least.     
 If this breaks her, I will hold you personally responsible.     
 Do you understand me?     
 Yes, Aunt Lydia.     
 I will, too.     
 [DOOR SHUTS]     
 [SOBBING SOFTLY] Hey.     
 She...     
 she's beautiful, isn't she?     
 [JANINE WHIMPERS]     
 [JANINE SNIFFLING]     
 You're gonna have curly hair just like your mom.     
 And you're gonna hate it. [CHUCKLES]     
 But I promise we'll find someone who knows how to cut it, and then you're just...     
 - You're gonna drive all the boys crazy. 
- [OFFRED CHUCKLES]     
 [JANINE SNIFFLING AND WHIMPERING]     
 [JANINE CRYING QUIETLY]     
 I'm going to see if there's anything more they can tell us.     
 Go in grace.     
 - [INDISTINCT CHATTER OVER RADIO] 
- [GUARDIAN] Level   all clear.     
 [INDISTINCT CHATTER OVER RADIO]     
 [DR. HODGSON] Why am I here?     
 Thank you. I'll take it from here.     
 [INDISTINCT RADIO CHATTER]     
 [MAN] The south entrance.     
 I can't tell you how excited I am to see you again.     
 You probably don't remember me.     
 You actually trained my mentor.     
 We met once at the      ACOG meeting.     
 Your seminar on therapeutic hypothermia.     
 Forgive me, but in the interest of time, could we dispense with the pleasantries?     
 Of course. Of course.     
 Patient is a   -month-old girl, born full term, presents with lethargy and vomiting times three weeks.     
 Upper GI was negative for malrotation. pH probe and swallow study also negative, but we're treating her for reflux anyway.     
 - [DR. HODGSON] And you want me to... 
- Yes.     
 We brought you here to get your medical opinion on the case.     
 All right.     
 Uh, let's get a head MRI with an MR, and, uh, I want to rerun this swallow survey.     
 Do you have a decent radiology department?     
 - [DR. EPSTEIN] Excellent. 
- I want to oversee the test anyway.     
 They're tricky to read pre-   months.     
 Run serum ammonia level and a urine for metabolic errors.     
 And let's get a skeletal survey, ECG, and a cardiac echo.     
 [DR. EPSTEIN] 
I'll start the wheels, Dr. Hodgson.     
 And, um...     
 I'm gonna need to examine her.     
 [DR. EPSTEIN] Of course.     
 [MONITORS BEEPING]     
 [COMMANDER FRED] Knock, knock?     
 [INAUDIBLE CONVERSATION]     
 [INAUDIBLE DIALOG]     
 [AUNT LYDIA] Verily I say unto thee, today thou shalt be with Me in paradise.     
 What's going on?     
 - No! No! 
- Okay.     
 - Oh, my darling. 
- No!     
 [JANINE SOBBING]     
 [OFFRED] Janine... would you like to kiss her goodbye?     
 Can I?     
 We can try.     
 [DOOR SLAMS SHUT]     
 How dare you give up!     
 Ma'am, we have done a very extensive evaluation.     
 There are no anatomic, infectious, or metabolic causes     
 that explain this baby's condition.     
 You are supposed to be the best in your field.     
 I am the best.     
 Or was.     
 All we can do for Angela is to unhook her from all those machines.     
 Help her feel safe and warm.     
 And pray.     
 - [GUARDIAN] Let's go. 
- [INDISTINCT RADIO CHATTER]     
 [INDISTINCT RADIO CHATTER]     
 [SNIFFLES]     
 [ANGELA COOING]     
 [JANINE] Hi, peanut. [CHUCKLING]     
 Long time no see.     
 [WARREN] Please...     
 Mommy's here.     
 [ANGELA COOING]     
 Oh.     
 Hi, sweetheart.     
 Shh.     
 Mm-hm.     
 Look at you.     
 
 
 
 [DOOR CLOSES]     
 Good night, Mrs. Waterford.     
 Good night, Offred.     
 Thank you.     
 Thank you.     
 The Commander wants to see you in his office.     
 Both of you.     
 Let me handle this.     
 Please shut the door.     
 [DOOR CLOSES]     
 I hear the Putnams got the help they needed.     
 Not enough, I'm afraid.     
 I was surprised to learn they received help from a Martha on a temporary transfer.     
 It was an even bigger surprise that I signed the transfer order myself.     
 I did it for the child.     
 What greater responsibility is there in Gilead?     
 Obeying your husband.     
 I've broken the rules for months now.     
 For your sake. With your consent.     
 I never consented to this.     
 Rewriting my memos to the committee?     
 I asked you to be my conduit, not my voice.     
 Fred, you've asked me to read over your work before.     
 That was then.     
 [GRUNTS]     
 Is this your handwriting?     
 Yes, Commander Waterford.     
 You involved the Handmaid in your transgressions?     
 I did what I thought was necessary.     
 Of course you did.     
 This isn't your fault.     
 It's mine.     
 It was unfair of me to burden you with so much responsibility.     
 Now we must make amends.     
 Amends?     
 "Wives, submit yourselves unto your own husbands, as unto the Lord.     
 And ye husbands, dwell with them according to knowledge.     
 Giving honor... unto the wife as unto the weaker vessel."     
 Fred, please.     
 But if we confess our sins, He is faithful and just to forgive us.     
 [BELT RUSTLING AND BUCKLE CLANKING]     
 [WHISPERED] Serena.     
 [WHISPERED] Forgive me, darling.     
 [SERENA CRYING OUT IN PAIN]

 [NICK] It was good. I'm just tired.     
 What do you think?     
 Looks nice.     
 Ah, tomorrow, I'm making curtains. So, pick a color.     
 What do you like?     
 Uh... yellow.     
 My favorite.     
 I know.     
 I straightened the clothes in your trunk.     
 You can fit a lot more in when your shirts are folded correctly.     
 Thanks.     
 What?     
 Where'd you get this?     
 They fell when I moved the trunk.     
 Did you read these?     
 Of course not.     
 Don't lie to me.     
 I picked them up and I put them there for you.     
 Never touch my things. 
Do you understand me?     
 - I'm sorry. 
- You understand?     
 - Yes. Yes. I do. 
- What?     
 Sir.     
 [CRYING AND WINCING IN PAIN]     
 [SOBBING SOFTLY]     
 [CRYING QUIETLY]     
 [KNOCKING CONTINUES]     
 Yes?     
 Mrs. Waterford.     
 Do you need anything?     
 No.     
 Can I do anything for you?     
 Serena?     
 Yes.     
 Go back to your room.     
 [CRYING QUIETLY]     
 [OFFRED]  Someone once said,   
 "Men are afraid that women will laugh at them.   
 Women are afraid that men will kill them."   
 We should've known better.   
 I thought there were still secret places.   
 Hidden in the cracks and crevices of this world.   
 Places we could make beautiful,   
 peaceful, quiet,   
 safe.   
 Or at least bearable.   
 I'm sorry. I know it's late.     
 Mmm...     
 I just wanted to apologize.     
 I guess I was only trying to help you.     
 But... I'm really sorry.     
 I know.     
 Can you forgive me?     
 You should get to bed.     
 Get some rest... for the sake of the baby.
