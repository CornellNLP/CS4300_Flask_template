 Narrator :  Previously on  Pretty Little Liars. 
 [GASPS] 
 I want to finish what I started to tell you at homecoming. 
 Is that lan? Melissa know he's back? 
 Don't know why she broke up with him. 
 She didn't. He broke up with her. 
 We have to make adjustments. This is a one-paycheck family. 
 We can no longer live a two-paycheck life. 
 This is Noel Kahn. He was your biggest crush... 
 ...all through middle school, and now he's asking you out. 
 Dad, this is my friend Maya. 
 Really happy to meet you. 
 Emily : "Alison loves lan"? 
 I was wrong. 
 Hanna! Hanna! 
 [SCREAMS] 
 There's been an accident. Please hurry. 
 "She knew too much. A." 
 Somebody! Help! 
 [SIREN CHIRPING] 
 Miss Marin. 
 Oh, hello, Barry. 
 Something wrong? 
 I'm afraid so. 
 It just came over the radio. I'm sorry... 
 ...but your daughter's been involved in an accident. 
 Is that Hanna? 
 [SIREN WAILING] 
 We have to get to the hospital. Are you guys okay to drive? 
 Yeah, I guess so. 
 Okay, come on. 
 Hanna's mom is with the doctor. 
 I'm okay. 
 They don't know who was driving the car. 
 We were at Mona's party, and Hanna got a text. 
 So we were going to the parking lot to meet her and that's when she got hit. 
 She was unconscious. We couldn't talk to her. 
 That's why we wanna wait, maybe they'll let us see her or something. 
 Um, call you back when I know something. Bye, Alex. 
 Is she okay, Mrs. Marin? 
 She is going to be all right. She, um... 
 She has a broken leg and a broken ankle, bruised ribs... 
 ...and, uh, they might have to remove her spleen. 
 What happened? 
 Hanna was coming across the parking lot... 
 ...and this car just came out of nowhere. 
 Well, the police found the car. They said it was stolen. 
 Did they catch the driver? 
 Ashley : No, not yet. 
 Cops should be looking for Toby Cavanaugh. 
 It wasrt Toby Cavanaugh. The police picked him up. 
 What? 
 One of the officers told me... 
 ...they found him hiding in town and they were bringing him in... 
 ...when they got the call about Hanna. 
 You girls should go home. 
 I will call you when Hanna can have visitors. 
 Just let Hanna know that we were here. 
 I will, when she wakes up. 
 Toby isn't A. 
 Well, Hanna knows who is. 
 That's why A tried to kill her. 
 Think they're just trying to scare us? 
 Well, it worked. 
 This was never about scaring us, that was just a bonus. 
 And this started with murder... 
 ...we were crazy to think it wouldn't end up like this. 
 So should we tell the cops? 
 Tell them what? 
 Everything. 
 We don't know. 
 So, what do we do? 
 Well, we talk to Hanna before we do anything. 
 Is Hanna safe here? 
 Yeah. 
 Nothing will happen to her while her mom is with her. 
 Mom said you called. 
 Are you all right? 
 Yeah. Yeah, I'm okay. 
 What happened? 
 [SOBS] 
 A car hit Hanna. 
 A car? 
 Who was driving? 
 We don't know. 
 They didn't stop? 
 No, they just... 
 They just knocked her down and drove away. 
 Oh, God. 
 Ian : Is she okay? 
 She's just shaken up. 
 No, I mean Hanna. 
 Yeah. 
 Yeah, her mom said she was gonna be all right. 
 Good. 
 Head's up, Spence, I'm canceling Monday's practice. 
 I'll be out in a minute, lan. 
 Okay. 
 He stayed the night? 
 It's not like we're strangers. 
 We went out for two years, and we had a lot to talk about. 
 Go upstairs. Get some sleep, okay? 
 Okay. 
 When they find the maniac who did this to you, I will kill him. 
 After I kill him, I will sue him. 
 Have you seen Aria or Spencer or Emily? 
 Yeah, they were all here. I sent them home. 
 Sean was here, too. 
 And a boy named Lucas. 
 Who is he exactly? 
 He works on the yearbook with me. 
 Mm. 
 I need to call Spencer. 
 They have to come back. 
 That can wait. 
 No. No, mom, it can't. 
 I will call them, now relax. 
 Ezra : I didn't see it till I came down this morning. 
 Maybe somebody put it there after you parked. 
 Aria, we both know when this happened. This happened last night. 
 I don't know that, neither do you. 
 "I see you"? Not "wash me." Not "go sharks." 
 "I see you." That's very specific. 
 Maybe it's specific, but it doesn't mean anything. 
 Aria, it means somebody saw us last night. 
 It doesn't mean anything. 
 Here you go. 
 Thank you. 
 I really don't want anything. 
 You need to eat some breakfast, honey. 
 I don't want you driving to the hospital if you're stressed out. 
 Give Ben a call, see if he'll give you a lift. 
 I don't think that's a good idea. Ben and I are sort of really over. 
 Everyone in town feels safer with Toby Cavanaugh locked up. 
 What happened to innocent until proven guilty? 
 Guilty or not, he's better with the police than wandering around. 
 There's always more to a story than people think. 
 [PHONE BEEPING] 
 Not at the table. 
 It might be about Hanna. 
 It's all right. 
 Emily : Does it hurt? 
 Yeah, kind of. 
 Do you remember what happened? 
 Uh, yeah, I remember. 
 Um, Mom, you've been here the whole time. 
 Do you wanna take a break? 
 Are you sure? 
 Yeah. 
 I'll be back in a couple of hours. 
 Noel Kahn is A. 
 Emily : What? Are you serious? 
 Yeah, I saw him in the woods, and he left an A message. 
 Spencer : You saw him leave a message? 
 He wrote something... 
 ...on the back of a car. 
 What car? What did he write? 
 "I see you." 
 How do you know? 
 I was in the car. 
 Whose car was it? 
 Ezra Fitz. 
 Mr. Fitz? 
 Aria? 
 Hanna? 
 It was Mr. Fitz. 
 You and Mr. Fitz. 
 You met him there? 
 Emily : The call you got at the party... 
 ...that was from him? 
 I couldn't tell. 
 I couldn't tell anyone. I promised Ezra. 
 Ezra? Hold it. This is something that's been going on? 
 You and a teacher? 
 I didn't just get into his car last night. 
 Who do you think I am? 
 How long have you been seeing him? 
 Since right before school started. 
 Oh, my God, since Labor Day? 
 Okay, so you don't have a boyfriend in Iceland? 
 No, I did. 
 Yeah, but it's not like that. 
 You were seeing a teacher when I fixed you up with Noel? 
 Oh, my God, I fixed you up with Noel. 
 And why did you get in his car last night? 
 Well, he, um, called me and... 
 Oh, don't look at me like that. 
 Ah, my head hurts just as much as my leg now. 
 What exactly did you see? 
 Well, I saw Aria go into a parked car... 
 ...and then I saw someone in a black hoodie... 
 ...write something on the back of the car window. 
 And when he turned around... 
 ...it was Noel. 
 No, it can't be Noel. 
 Aria, I saw what I saw. 
 And A tried to kill her for it. 
 Okay, but none of us saw who was driving the car. 
 [KNOCKING ON DOOR] 
 If that's someone with painkillers, just let them in. 
 Noel. 
 I just heard about Hanna. 
 Thought I'd try to visit. 
 Yeah, she just fell asleep. We were getting ready to leave. 
 What happened? 
 Don't you know? 
 I heard it was a hit-and-run. 
 Who told you that? 
 Sean. Is she gonna be okay? 
 Yeah, we hope so. 
 This is insane. 
 Yeah, you're right about that. 
 Well, um, I'll take this in for you. 
 We need to talk. 
 I know. 
 You'll call me? 
 Sure, yeah. 
 Noel. 
 Where were you last night? 
 Hanging with Sean. Why? 
 Um... No, I was just wondering. 
 He lied to me... 
 ...about being there. He said he was with Sean. 
 This house isn't gonna clean itself. 
 This house looks fine to me. 
 You know, the water heater's on its last leg. 
 I'll take care of it. 
 Heh. I'm sorry. 
 About what? 
 You come home, and all I do is rattle off a list of things that are broken. 
 It's all right. 
 It makes me feel needed. 
 Oh, you're needed. 
 How long? 
 Not sure. 
 They want me to supervise training exercises... 
 ...but they haven't set a schedule yet. 
 Where do you have to go? 
 Texas. 
 It's only one time zone away. 
 It's just so much better when you're here... 
 ...for me and Emily. 
 It's better with the whole team, you know? 
 I know. 
 You're doing great, though. 
 Honey, so much as happened to her. 
 This business about the Cavanaugh kid? 
 Well, yeah, that, and Alison and... 
 She's just really confused right now. 
 Confused how? 
 Honey, daughters don't talk to their mothers... 
 ...the way they talk to their dads. 
 You need her to tell you something, you ask her. 
 She'll tell you the truth. 
 I gotta finish. 
 [YELLS] 
 Oh, my God, Mona. 
 I'm waving a white La Perla. 
 That's, like, the international peace symbol. 
 Can I come in? 
 Heh, yeah. Come in. 
 Oh, that cast. That's... 
 That's, like, for a broken leg. 
 That won't keep you from wearing heels, will it? 
 Just for a little bit. 
 Aww. 
 If I hadrt uninvited you to my party then you wouldn't have felt... 
 ...so desperate you had to sneak around the edges and get hit by that car. 
 [SIGHS] 
 I almost feel guilty. 
 Mona, you don't have anything to feel guilty for. 
 Oh, good. 
 Can we go back to being friends? 
 The past is forgotten. 
 Friends forever. 
 What? 
 You just look sort of vague. 
 Oh, um... 
 I don't have any makeup on. 
 I can fix that. 
 Oh, I'm glad we're friends again. 
 I promise never to listen to another rumor unless I start it myself. 
 Do you remember that time you threw up on the trampoline? 
 You did that backflip and you barfed. 
 Trust me, I remember. 
 Well, the thing I remember was your dismount. 
 You knew everybody was staring at you. 
 You got to the edge, climbed down, and looked at us. 
 You wiped your mouth, and then you took a bow. 
 [LAUGHS] 
 I was in awe. 
 Of me hurling on the trampoline? 
 No, of that bow. 
 I mean, it was like this incredible life lesson. 
 That's when I knew I wanted to be your friend. 
 Wow, I never knew that. 
 Because I never told you. 
 Ah. Concealer. The true miracle drug. 
 Are you sure about what you saw on that tree? 
 We both saw it, Aria. 
 Well, I know, but I mean, do you think that maybe... 
 ...Ali just put it up there to see what it might look like? 
 No, Ali may have done some psycho things... 
 ...but she would never do anything tacky. 
 Anyway, lan was with Melissa last night, so he couldn't be A. 
 Which brings us back to Noel. 
 He had means. He had opportunity. 
 Those pictures of Emily and Maya were stolen at Noel's party. 
 Right. 
 Yeah, I know. 
 And Hanna saw him write that message on the back of Mr. Fitz's car. 
 Uh, no, just slow down. Heh. 
 You flipped over to Noel awful fast. 
 Just 12 hours ago, you were sure it was Toby. 
 What happened to that theory? 
 A or not... 
 ...you still need to know what Noel saw, and what he plans to do about it. 
 NURSE : I'm sorry, visiting hours were over two hours ago. 
 You can come by in the morning. 
 Hey. 
 You all right? 
 Yeah. They adjusted my meds. I'm just getting used to them. 
 Who sent the orchids? 
 Mm. Sean brought them this morning. 
 Very nice. 
 Mom, I don't have to be in a private room. 
 I can move, we can save a couple bucks. 
 You don't have to worry about it. 
 Well, I'm alone here all day with a mummified leg. 
 Aside from wondering how I'm gonna go to the bathroom... I do nothing but worry. 
 The bank and I have reached an accommodation. 
 They're gonna give you a loan? 
 Sort of a professional courtesy. 
 Something to help us get back on our feet. It's very short-term. 
 So we're gonna be okay? 
 We're gonna be okay. 
 You concentrate on getting well, okay? 
 
 
 
 [PLAYING SLOW SONG] 
 You didn't call. 
 Sorry. 
 It got late. 
 What's the word on Hanna? 
 She's better. 
 That's great. 
 They catch the guy that did it? 
 Not yet. 
 The police are talking to everyone who was there to see if... 
 ...you know, anyone saw anything. 
 Did you see anything? 
 Who told you I was at the campground? 
 I saw you in the crowd when they were putting Hanna in the ambulance. 
 I wasrt sure then, but I'm sure now. It was you. 
 It was supposed to be a joke. 
 A joke? 
 Yeah, like a movie. 
 Bunch of girls in the woods. I went out there to give you guys a scare. 
 I saw you going off... 
 ...so I followed you. 
 Followed you to his car. 
 You wrote on the window. 
 Should've thrown a rock. 
 What did you see? 
 Enough to figure out... 
 ...why you act so squirrelly around him. 
 What did he promise you to get in that car? I'll go to the principal with you. 
 Principal? 
 Take this guy down... 
 ...for what he made you do. 
 No. 
 They could put him in jail. 
 Noel, stop. 
 It's not like that. 
 Then what is it like? 
 If you care about me at all, please don't say anything to anyone. 
 Just let me handle it. 
 Promise me. 
 [BELL RINGING] 
 I have to go. 
 Noel, please. Promise me. 
 All right. 
 I promise. 
 Do you know when Agent Cooper will be back? 
 It's about Toby Cavanaugh. 
 I wanna know if he's allowed to have any visitors. 
 No, I'm not family. I'm a friend. 
 Just have her call me back, please. Thank you. 
 He doesn't wanna see you. 
 And even if he did, I wouldn't let him. 
 He's been hurt, Emily. 
 You should be able to understand that. 
 I didn't tell the police where he was. 
 But look what you've done. 
 You've made him run away. 
 The police came to our house because of you. 
 They found that sweater because of you. 
 Let me talk to him, please. 
 No. 
 I'm not gonna let anyone come between us again. 
 Somebody should have come between you two a long time ago. 
 Maybe a social worker with a bucket of ice water. 
 I can't imagine why everyone thinks you're the sweet one. 
 [DOOR OPENS] 
 Did you miss me? 
 Ali. 
 They said you were dead. 
 Yeah, I heard that too... 
 ...but here I am. 
 What happened to you? 
 It's complicated, Hanna. 
 Really complicated. 
 Worse than algebra. 
 What happened when you left the barn? 
 We all wanna know. 
 You already do. 
 The four of you combined. 
 You remember more about that night than you think you do. 
 [DOOR CLOSES] 
 Where'd you go? 
 To meet a boy? 
 Noel? 
 Noel? 
 Please. 
 Please, just tell me the truth. 
 It won't make any difference, darling. 
 How can you say that? 
 Because I know. 
 You think the truth is some big shiny disco ball of purity? 
 Then go ahead and try it. 
 Be honest. See what it gets you. 
 Telling the truth to the wrong person is how I ended up where I am. 
 Take it from me... 
 ...you're always better off with a really good lie. 
 Gotta go. 
 Where? 
 I was so scared that you were gonna die. 
 That's why I came back. 
 I didn't care how dangerous it was, I had to see you. 
 You know, I really should do something about A. 
 That bitch is genuinely getting on my nerves. 
 I was gonna look for you. 
 I think we need to talk. 
 Yeah. Uh... 
 I'm sorry about the car situation. 
 Common sense kicked in in about third period. 
 You're right. 
 Somebody probably just doesn't like the way I park. 
 [GIRLS GIGGLING] 
 You are right about there being other people. 
 We have to be really careful. 
 I've been careful. 
 Remember, careful made you unappy? 
 You don't make me unappy. 
 I, uh... 
 I mean, you totally mess me up and I feel miserable sometimes... 
 ...but you don't make me unappy. 
 And... 
 ...I wasrt unappy the other night. 
 But? 
 But... 
 ...would you go back if you could? 
 If you knew that it would be this complicated... 
 ...would you have even... 
 ...talked to me that first day in the bar? 
 I've thought about it. 
 If I had left before you walked in... 
 ...we'd have no problems. 
 You'd be a girl that sits one row from the windows... 
 ...and I'd be the new teacher. 
 All neat and tidy. 
 Heh. 
 Is that what you want? 
 To go back? 
 No. 
 Me neither. 
 So we don't go back. 
 We go forward. Together. 
 Emily : Did you tell Mr. Fitz about Noel? 
 His name's Ezra. 
 Maybe you get to call him Ezra. 
 He's still Mr. Fitz to us. 
 Did you tell him? 
 No, I couldn't. 
 Aria. 
 Well, how could I? 
 Well, what about you and Noel? 
 There isn't a me and Noel. 
 There never really was. 
 Does he know that? 
 I think he does. 
 You think he does. 
 Yeah, I just don't know how hard to push him. 
 But I know that it's a one-way street... 
 ...so once I say something to anybody, I can't take it back. 
 I know what you mean. 
 Pudding-cup-alooza. 
 Vanilla, tapioca, butterscotch. 
 Uh, tapioca. I like the little bumps. 
 [WHISTLES] 
 That's starting to look like the Declaration of Independence. 
 You know, Lucas, you don't have to keep skipping school. 
 I'm okay. 
 I told office I was doing community service. 
 They believed you? 
 I have a very believable face. 
 I plan to use it in politics. 
 Well, you're a good friend. 
 Thanks. 
 You know, being friends with somebody... 
 ...that can be more important sometimes... 
 ...than getting to know them in a different way. 
 Mm-hm. 
 Yeah, um, I have to ask you something. 
 They have me on all kinds of drugs and things... 
 ...and sometimes things can be... 
 ...a little... 
 I don't know, um... 
 The medical term for what you're looking for is loopy. 
 Right, loopy. 
 I mean, I have, like,  Twilight Zone  moments. 
 Funny dreams, just really unexpected stuff. 
 And it can be confusing. 
 Did I just see that? Was that person really here? 
 Did I imagine that whole thing just happened? 
 Did Lucas actually kiss me when he thought I was asleep? 
 Yeah, things like that. 
 I thought you might have been awake... 
 ...and then I thought if she was awake... 
 ...and she didn't scream, then that was a good sign. 
 Well, I was too surprised to do anything. 
 Really? You were that surprised? Me wanting to kiss you... 
 ...was so outside realm of probability? 
 No. No, it's not that. 
 It's just... 
 You know, I thought that we were friends. 
 Ugh. 
 Look, I like you, Lucas. 
 I feel like you're breaking up with me... 
 ...but we were never really together. 
 Lucas, I am being honest with you. 
 And besides, I have a boyfriend. 
 I think you deserve a better boyfriend. 
 Well, that's between me and Sean. 
 Look, I like you way too much to lie to you... 
 ...and that's something I used to do all the time. 
 Couldrt you just keep lying, just for old time's sake? 
 I'm sorry. 
 No, Lucas, you don't have to leave. 
 If I stay, you're gonna think that I'm okay about this and I'm not. 
 I'm sorry. 
 I'm just being honest. 
 Emily : I don't know, Maya. 
 I mean, with Hanna in the hospital, everything's on hold. 
 Yeah. 
 I miss you too. 
 Maybe tomorrow? 
 [CHUCKLES] 
 I gotta go. 
 Right, bye. 
 Was that Hanna? 
 No. Maya. 
 Does Mom need help with dinner? 
 No, not yet. 
 Okay. 
 Do you remember Dennis Small? 
 Yeah. 
 He told me that he heard you've been calling the station. 
 That you're trying to visit this Toby Cavanaugh. 
 Do you wanna tell me why you're trying to talk to this boy? 
 I want him to know that it wasrt me who told the police where to find him. 
 Has he threatened you in any way? 
 No. 
 What is it? 
 Your mother thinks you're keeping some secret. 
 You been jumpy since I got home. I thought it was because... 
 ...I hadrt been around but that's not it. Something's eating you. 
 It's like you said, I'm just a little jumpy. 
 You tell me who's giving you a hard time, and I will take care of it. 
 It's not like that. 
 Lf you need help, you ask for it. 
 There's nothing to be ashamed about. 
 Dad... 
 I'm gonna talk to Toby Cavanaugh. 
 I'm gonna put an end to it. 
 I'm not afraid of Toby. 
 You're afraid of something. I can see it in your eyes. What? 
 I'm afraid of you and Mom. 
 Why are you afraid of us? 
 Because I'm not who you think I am. 
 [LAUGHS] 
 You're Emily, my little girl. I'd know you anywhere. 
 I got a picture of you in my wallet. 
 I'm eight years old in that picture. 
 That's a different girl. 
 It's the same girl. 
 We just need a new picture. 
 It's not that simple. 
 Emmy. 
 I'm gay. 
 I'm gay. 
 A bar? You met him in a bar? 
 It's not a bar, it's a pub. 
 And he hit on you? 
 Yeah, we were talking about writing. 
 Yeah, read any good books lately? 
 Hey, seriously. 
 Boy... 
 ...part of me thinks this is really self-destructive behavior... 
 ...but most of me just thinks it's really hot. 
 Spence, don't tease, okay? 
 It's not funny. It's the opposite of funny. 
 I'm sorry. 
 It's just... 
 ...I don't know how I'm supposed to react. 
 Yeah, neither do I. 
 Show me the stupid tree, okay? 
 Yeah, it's right over here. 
 You are not gonna tell me... 
 Spencer : No, this was it. 
 It was right here. 
 You sure that you have the right spot? 
 I'm sure. 
 It's gone. 
 This isn't something she came up with. It's that girl from California. Maya. 
 Before we start talking about other people, let's just talk about Emily. 
 Why didn't she tell us? 
 She was afraid. 
 Of me? 
 Of both of us. 
 She's not afraid of us. 
 You wanna know what she's afraid of? 
 This is what she's afraid of. 
 Where'd you get these? 
 Somebody mailed it to me. 
 Someone who wanted me to know. WAYNE: You had this and didn't tell me? 
 Pam : When? When you walked through the door after being gone... 
 ...for eight months? 
 Is that how I'm supposed to welcome you home? 
 How are we gonna fix this? 
 Fix it? 
 This is not like buying her braces. This is who she is. 
 That's not who she is. 
 This is what someone else is making her into. 
 Maybe she's just experimenting. 
 This is wrong. This is completely wrong and you know it. 
 Do you think I like this? I don't. 
 When I went in there, I didn't know what she was gonna tell me. 
 I thought, sweet God, what is this? Drugs? This Toby kid get her pregnant? 
 Let's just keep this in perspective. 
 What is your perspective? 
 She is struggling with this. I can see it. 
 And I can't? 
 That's not what I'm saying. 
 Then what are you saying? 
 Are you willing to just turn away from everything we ever wanted for her? 
 Let her ruin her life so she can experiment? 
 What happened to you? 
 What happened to your values? Did you just leave them... 
 ...out in the desert somewhere? 
 I told you, I don't like this. 
 But she is alive and healthy. 
 After everything I've seen... 
 ...alive and healthy counts for a lot, believe me. 
 We should call Em and Hanna. 
 We'll talk to them at the hospital. 
 A tree, Spence, an entire tree. 
 I would have been fine with just cranberry juice. 
 [DOOR OPENS] 
 Oh, you found my stash. 
 Should be cold enough, right? Yeah. 
 You have great timing. Grab some glasses, Melissa's out in the barn. 
 I'd like to know what I'm celebrating. 
 You don't have to be celebrating... 
 ...to drink champagne. That's very old-fashioned thinking. 
 You canceled practice today. 
 Yes, I did. 
 To be with Melissa? 
 Yes. 
 Why? 
 Uh, you know, why don't you come out and talk to your sister? 
 No. I think I'd like to hear this from you. 
 We're married. 
 [BOTH LAUGH] 
 You're what? 
 We eloped. 
 Yeah, it's incredible. It's like last year never happened. 
 Congratulations. 
 Do Mom and Dad know? 
 Not yet. 
 Yeah, we expect they'll be a little, um, surprised, but... 
 Surprised? Ha. 
 This is what I want. They'll understand. 
 You'll help me with them. 
 I know I can count on you. 
 All right, uh, bring some glasses. We'll have a toast. 
 Spence, what just happened? 
 You told them? 
 Yeah. 
 How was that? 
 Rough. 
 Hey, it's gonna be okay, Em. 
 I don't know what it's gonna be... 
 ...but it's gonna be different. 
 I guess so. 
 So the whole tree? 
 Yeah, lock, stock, and bird's nest. 
 Why? 
 Why show something like that and then just take it away? 
 Like A had a split personality. 
 Hanna : That's great. 
 Homicidal and nuts. 
 We've been thinking... 
 ...maybe we're dealing with more than one person. 
 Hanna : A and Ali's killer are two separate people? 
 You are freaking out the invalid. 
 No, think about it. 
 Hanna : No, you think about it. 
 Arert we in enough trouble? 
 I know I am. Just look at me. 
 Hann. 
 Hann, who wrote this? 
 I don't know. 
 People have been in and out all day, and so have I. 
 Oh, no. 
 Hanna : What? 
 What? What's on there? 
 "Sorry about losing my temper. My bad. 
 Love, A." 
 Who put that on my leg? 
 Who wrote that? 
 Did somebody come in here while you were asleep? 
 I don't know. Just get it off. Just wipe it off! 
 Get it off me!
