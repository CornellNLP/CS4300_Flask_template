 Pam : I know, honey. 
 Emily : Aria's back. 
 Pam : Does she still have that pink hair? 
 Emily : No, mom, she doesn't. 
 Pam : You know something? I never really understood that family. Why would a mother let her daughter do something like that 
 Emily : Because they believe their kids are their equals, not their property. 
 Pam : Honey, I don't think you're my property, but I'm your mom. What kind of mother would I be if I let you Run around looking like a goth? That kind of lifestyle might fly in Europe, But it's not gonna get you very far here in rosewood.
