 Is that what you got from the house? 
 Some old dress? 
 It's your grandmother's, isn't it? 
 (Speaks Indigenous language) 
 What's he saying? 
 He said he is our father. He said Kalinda was his wife. 
 (Shouts in Indigenous language) 
 What? 
 Get away from me, you black b*st*rd! 
 Elishia : You were buried outside the cemetery, which means you were either a suicide or a murderer. 
 Is this another one? 
 It's just a hole empty. 
 (Chokes) 
 It wasn't Kev! He didn't do it! 
 Do you know your name? 
 Charlie. 
 OK, your full name? 
 I can't remember. 
 (Bone cracks) 
 Man : Yeah, that's one of ours. 
 Vic : Do you have an address? 
 Yes, I can give you directions. 
 It was never gonna work, trying to keep you all here. 
 Hello? 
 Hello, Sarah. 
 ♪ Theme music ♪ 
 (Sarah retches) 
 You OK, Sar? Do you want a glass of water? 
 No, I don't want a glass of water! 
 OK, OK. 
 (Gasps) 
 Just... 
 No, no, no, no, no, no! 
 Maybe you should just lie down for a minute. 
 No, no, please, both of you, please, just stop it. 
 Erm, so, if you came out of your grave, as you say, erm... then why don't you look sick? 
 Why have you got hair? 
 I don't know. 
 I've been checked out by Dr McKellar, and as far as she can tell, I'm in perfect health. 
 Um... shouldn't you be in the hospital? 
 No hospitals, no. 
 That was my choice. 
 This is happening to me, and that's what I want. 
 OK, I don't... 
 Oh! 
 Sorry, I just don't know what to think. 
 If I only have one more week, then that's... that's what I got. 
 (Gasps) Baby's going crazy. 
 Sit, please. Just sit, Sarah. Sit down, come on. Sit. 
 OK? 
 So, how long... how far have you got to go? 
 Um, I've got two weeks. 
 Oh! 
 How scary is that? 
 Very. 
 Um, James, I do want a glass of water. 
 Yep. 
 Can you get me a glass of water? 
 Yeah. 
 It's good to see you, Sarah. 
 (Cries) I missed you so much! 
 Thank you. 
 Hey, here you are -- 
 Charles P Thompson, Battle of Fromelles. 
 You were awarded the Military Cross. 
 Hey! 
 Not such a pussy after all, Chuckles. 
 Doesn't say how I died or where or anything. 
 You know he doesn't look like you. 
 It's not me. 
 I had a tobacco tin just like this. 
 Come on, we're going to the Royal. 
 Bit early. 
 I can't wrap my head around this. 
 No-one can. 
 But Dr McKellar knows? 
 Yes. 
 So, when we were at the ultrasound, before you told me, you told her. 
 No, she knew from the start. She was at the cemetery. 
 OK, but Vic knows? 
 Yeah, I told him, but... he hasn't seen Kate... 
 You told him. 
 We but need to keep this contained. 
 Why do we need to keep this contained, James?! 
 Because as soon as someone finds out, they're gonna take Kate away. 
 It was you, wasn't it? 
 What? 
 You took Smudge. 
 No, she followed me. 
 When you broke into the house. 
 How can I break into my own house? 
 No-one's taken anything from you, Kate. 
 I found this house. 
 I bought it with James. I polished those floorboards. 
 This house is mine. 
 That couch is mine, and Smudge is my dog. 
 You were dead, Kate. 
 I used to drink here. 
 Me too. 
 Let's go inside, see if I remember anything. 
 No money, Charlie. 
 No home, no family, no nothing. 
 Then we got nothing to lose. 
 (Voices murmur) 
 He could still be around. 
 Who? 
 The b*st*rd that knocked me off. 
 Well, how'd you know who he was? 
 I'll know. 
 What can I get you, mate? 
 (Feedback whistles) 
 Cheers. 
 Cheers, fellas! 
 (All cheer) 
 (Laughter and cheering) 
 What'll you have, eh? 
 Beer. 
 Well you've come to the right place. 
 No, give us one of them -- a Dirty Annie. 
 How did you know that's a Dirty Annie? 
 They drank it in the war. 
 (Laughs) Well, it's nice to meet a bloke who knows his history. 
 I'm Russell Russell Llewellyn. 
 Charles Charles P. Thompson. 
 Was there someone put you up to this, eh? 
 No, no, that's my name. 
 I'm... I'm named after Charlie -- the other Charlie. 
 What Charles P. Thompson? The Anzac legend? 
 My very own flesh and blood. 
 Well, he never had any kids. 
 No, but his sister, Dorothy, she did. 
 Oh, what she's your...? 
 Great... great-grandmother. 
 (Laughs) Oh! Wow! 
 Well, it is a privilege and an honour to meet you, Charlie. 
 (Laughs) 
 Hey, do you know much about him, the real Charlie? 
 Well, I know pretty much all there is to know. 
 Oh, well, that's why I'm here, to learn what I can. 
 OK, well, I'll shout you a drink and I'll tell you what I know, and then you can tell me what you know. 
 Fair enough. 
 OK, well, you can have whatever you want, except not a Dirty Annie -- these are collectibles. 
 Uh, just a beer, thanks, Russell. 
 Ah! (Laughs) 
 And I'll have a Bundy and Coke, double. 
 Ah, hello there. So, you're his...? 
 Sister. I'm related to Charlie too. 
 (Gasps) 
 Don't do this to yourself. 
 (Cries) This was my studio, James. It's not fair. 
 I know it's not. I know. 
 (Cries) 
 James donated all of your stuff. The room was left empty. 
 I couldn't have a baby. 
 Do you remember what you said to me, Kate? 
 You said that when you died, you didn't want James to spend the rest of his life alone and grieving for you. 
 It was a hope, not a bloody instruction! 
 We never forgot you for a minute, Kate, but we've found something and it's real. 
 That's great. 
 (Doorknob rattles) 
 Sergeant. What are you doing here? 
 I have reason to believe you're harbouring people. 
 Get off my property. You've no right to be here. 
 I'm the police... Where are they? 
 What are you talking about? 
 You know exactly what I'm talking about! 
 Where are they? 
 This way. 
 (Sharon speaks Indigenous language) 
 'Father'. 
 (Speaks Indigenous language) 
 Where the dead reside. 
 (Speaks Indigenous language) 
 'River'. 
 He's right, isn't he? 
 (Speaks Indigenous language) 
 What does that mean? 
 'Where's my wife?' 
 And that's it, then. So, that's what he meant. 
 Kath : Who? 
 Kalinda was betrothed to another. 
 Careful what you're saying, mate. 
 That's my nanna you're talking about. 
 But he knew her. 
 I knew her. 
 She was my... my Roisin Dubh, -- my Black Rose. 
 No finer woman ever walked. 
 She taught me language, secret history. 
 Yeah? Like what? 
 Like Henry McMillian murdered her father. 
 Where? 
 Shot him in the back below at the waterhole. 
 Who told you that? 
 That's our history. 
 Don't I know it is? 
 Well, that's proof, then. 
 Of what? 
 Well, you lot -- you're the fruit of my loins, my own flesh and blood. 
 You're Fitzgeralds! 
 We're family. 
 Well, maybe Lucy Fitzgerald will give you some of the family silver, but we haven't got anything. 
 Sure, I've nothing either. 
 But I'm seeking restoration. 
 You're my descendants. You must help me. 
 Oh, no, come on, you gotta go. I gotta go to work. Come on, up! 
 Mum! 
 Come on! 
 No! 
 He's telling the truth! 
 No, he's a nutter! 
 I'm telling the truth. 
 Don't encourage him, Beau. Move! 
 You see, you don't understand. You're not listening to me. 
 Come on, out! Out! 
 You're my flesh and... 
 But you don't under... 
 Uh! 
 Mum, lock this door. 
 But... 
 I'll have one of those. 
 Now's the time for us to really talk. 
 OK. 
 I love both of you. 
 Uh, OK, wow. 
 I never stopped loving you, Kate, but after you died, I fell in love with Sarah. 
 I need you to tell me about the first time you slept with James. 
 Why? 
 Because I need to know what you were thinking. 
 I wasn't thinking anything, Kate. It just happened. 
 Oh, no, no, no. Marriage and a baby doesn't just happen. 
 I didn't plan any of this, Kate. 
 But you were attracted to him? 
 No, we were friends. You know that. 
 Maybe I was attracted to him, I never thought about it, and you know, only in the way that you're sometimes attracted to people you're not married to. 
 Nothing happened when you were alive. 
 When did it happen? 
 We just kissed, that's all we did. 
 It was James's birthday. 
 We were both very, very drunk. 
 Mmm. 
 And we confessed that neither of us had been kissed properly in a long time. 
 And then James bawled his eyes out and f*cked off to that park you used to go to. 
 Neither of you have answered my question. 
 We slept together in September. 
 Oh, that's... less than a year after I died! 
 I know how long it was! 
 Everyone was crazy with grief. 
 James was completely broken. We were all just trying to help him. 
 Help him?! 
 Help him how? Like this?! 
 What the f*ck?! 
 Enough! Enough! 
 You two are the people I love most in the world. 
 Now there's a baby coming. 
 I've done nothing wrong here! 
 We've all done nothing wrong! 
 (Door opens) 
 Vic : There's nobody here. 
 This is where they've been staying, but I don't know where they are. 
 Why were you hiding them? 
 What do you want with them? 
 I see uncertainty in you. 
 Really? 
 Do you know what it is to have clarity of purpose? 
 I believe I do. 
 It means that all those thoughts, those worries that afflict people, that confuse and confound... and limit people -- I have none of those. 
 (Twigs snap) 
 Don't hurt him! Stop, stop! Arggh! 
 Who are you?! Are you risen?! 
 He's a friend! Leave him alone! 
 Has she told you why you're back?! 
 Stop! Stop! 
 So, you'll help me? 
 Yes. 
 Yes, yes, I'll help you, I promise. 
 Kirstie : I'll play the winner, yeah? 
 So, on July the 19th, the British 61st Division and the 5th Australian Division were here. 
 Now, the problem was that f*cking British intelligence -- now, that's an oxymoron, Charlie -- had totally failed to pick up this. 
 Give me some space, would you? 
 Oh, you didn't call your shot, and you've gotta call your shot. 
 So, the bloody Germans had actually abandoned these trenches, right? 
 And they'd actually set up 200 metres behind where we thought they were, and this ended up being a huge problem, because we couldn't set the artillery, and there was nowhere to go once they came over that no-man's-land. 
 There was just one hell of a... (Voice fades) 
 (Feedback whistles) 
 (Men chatter and sing raucously) 
 ♪ The captain of the bush... ♪ 
 Man : Hurry up in there, come on! 
 You're up next, George. 
 Couple of newcomers here! 
 (Laughter) 
 Hit him! Hit him! 
 Man : Give him a nudge! 
 (Men cheer) 
 Go, Charlie, come on! 
 Man : Thump him, George! 
 (Men shout) 
 Man : Come on! 
 .. small parts of the German trenches were actually taken by our guys, but without the... 
 As you can see here, there's no flanking... 
 Who is this? 
 I'll get to that in a second. 
 I'll just finish this story first... 
 Who is this? 
 Well, that's... 
 Ah, well, this is the 5th, and who's that? 
 You're the dead spit. 
 Yeah, I know that, but... who is this man? 
 Oh, I don't know. He's probably one of the fallen. 
 I mean, not many made it back from Fromelles. 
 (Kirstie laughs) Oi! I didn't bloody touch you! 
 Let's see... Charlie! 
 Man : Give it back! 
 You've got the tattoo! Show me your arm! 
 Show me! 
 Nah, it's not him. It's not... 
 I'm sorry! 
 It's alright! 
 Charlie, can we go home? (Cries) 
 (Sighs) I need to stay. 
 Er, looks like your sister could do with a little bit of a lie-down. 
 Well, how about I open up a room upstairs? 
 Do you want to have a bit of a lie-down? 
 Bev can look after the bar. 
 Yeah. 
 Hey, Bev? 
 Come on. 
 Follow me. 
 We can't have Charlie Thompson's relatives wandering around Yoorana like that. 
 There you go. In here. 
 
 
 
 (Whispers) I remembered something. I was in a fight. 
 Yeah, it was the bloody Germans, wasn't it? 
 No, with someone else, another soldier. 
 I think he might've hurt me, or maybe he murdered me. 
 Then you were murdered too. 
 Well, maybe we all were. 
 Charlie, come with me. 
 I'll be back. 
 Thanks, Charlie. 
 The ladies can't handle the piss. 
 She'll be right after a bit of a lie-down. 
 Yeah, shall we get back to it? 
 Um, you know, it's funny, you coming here searching for Charlie. 
 Is it? 
 Can I show you something? 
 (Keys jangle) 
 I'm sorry. 
 I don't know how to do this. 
 Yeah, I know. 
 I mean, I don't know how to be alive again. 
 Do you remember dying? 
 I remember the cancer. 
 But no, I don't remember death. 
 Well, maybe you didn't really die. 
 I crawled out of my grave. 
 (Both laugh) 
 I remember you, though. 
 When I was dying, uh... you were there a lot. 
 I didn't know you wanted a baby. 
 No, neither did I, but... you know, we talked about what to do, and there'd been so much loss and sadness. 
 Did you... 
 Did you ever feel like you were second choice? 
 Of course I did. 
 But we talked about that too. 
 You did? 
 Yeah, we talked about everything. 
 (Sighs) I mean, James and I went through a lot after you died. 
 Yeah. 
 But I guess that's what made us close. 
 Guess I kind of brought you together. 
 I think I'm gonna go and lie down. 
 That vodka's made me feel a bit sick. 
 OK. 
 Move! 
 Move it! 
 Get in! 
 (Stamps) 
 Get in! 
 What goes on in here? 
 There's nothing here. It's just blood samples and paperwork. 
 (Clattering and banging) 
 Where did you get this? 
 It was in the house when I arrived. 
 You're lying. It's in one of your specimen bags. 
 I found it in one of the graves. 
 Whose grave? 
 Do you know what this is? 
 No. I just put it in the bag. 
 This doesn't belong to you. 
 It doesn't belong to you either. 
 Who are you? 
 I'm Dr Elishia McKellar. 
 I know about what you're doing with Noregard. 
 Call James. Tell him to bring everybody back here. 
 I can't... I don't... 
 Do it now. 
 You OK? 
 Yeah. 
 Sarah's in the bedroom. 
 You know I love you. 
 I know. 
 And I never stopped loving you. 
 I can understand... that it's possible to love us both when I was dead... but I'm back now. 
 I'm here. 
 I know. 
 (Mobile phone rings) 
 Elishia? 
 Where's Kate? 
 She's here. 
 You need to go look for her, and the others too -- 
 Kirstie, Maria, Charlie, Paddy -- and bring them here. 
 It's imperative. 
 I just told you Kate's here. 
 Exactly, and him too. It's very important. 
 Are you in trouble? 
 Of course. I will. 
 Is somebody there with you now? 
 Yes. 
 You know the place. 
 (Button beeps) 
 He's coming. 
 Good. 
 That was Elishia. I think Vic's with her. 
 Something's wrong? 
 What? 
 I don't know. I have to get up there. 
 Do you want me to come with you? 
 No. 
 Stay here, protect Kate. I have to get ready. 
 I know he came out of the grave. I was there. 
 The night of the argument with your mum? 
 Yeah. He knew those words and that story. 
 He found that dress. 
 What does he want? 
 Her dress and restitution. 
 Is that what he said? 
 Yeah. He's a bit of a w*nk*r. 
 He's back, I reckon. A spirit. 
 Shouldn't we help him? 
 No, could be dangerous. 
 Not to me. 
 Well, now we know why I'm back, huh? 
 And you, you little b*st*rd, you're my ticket to restoration. 
 How? 
 We are gonna take back what's rightfully mine, and what's rightfully mine is partially yours. 
 What the f*ck are you talking about? 
 Us Fitzgeralds, we're gonna put a halt to the sale of my estate. 
 That's it. Good lad. 
 (Charlie breathes heavily) 
 They're claustrophobic, aren't they? 
 Now, before these came in, a soldier would have to cover his mouth with socks or with rags soaked in his own urine to withstand the gas. 
 These are just replicas that I got on eBay, but this one... is an authentic German World War II. 
 There was another war? 
 (Laughs) Good one. 
 So, have you ever thought of joining up? 
 Well, you got the right genes. 
 You you're what this country really needs. 
 You know, what the ADF needs -- men who understand what it is to sacrifice, men like Charles P. Thompson. 
 See, he understood it. 
 Discipline, duty, mateship. 
 Oh, that's a binocular. 
 Wait. 
 You be the spotter... and I will be the sniper. 
 Come on. 
 (Feedback whistles) 
 Cross-breeze. 
 Point two. 
 Moving east to west. 
 Three fingers. 
 Now. 
 (Rifle fires) 
 (Gunfire) 
 Missed. 
 Let's have a cigarette. 
 Yeah, I'll roll it. 
 Give me the smokes. 
 Alright, just let me catch my breath. 
 Alright, Charlie. 
 Got him. 
 (Gunfire) 
 George? 
 (Cries) 
 Hey! 
 (Sobs) 
 Hey, hey, it's alright, mate. We're just having a bit of fun. 
 (Sobs) I was a sniper. 
 Yeah, well, sometimes when I'm in that room for a while, it starts to become very, very... 
 I came home. I didn't die! 
 Let's have a drink. 
 (Sobs) 
 Come on. 
 Paddy : Pharma-cuticles. 
 Lucy Fitzgerald! 
 Yes, hello? 
 Patrick Patrick Fitzgerald. 
 Any relation? 
 Yes, madam, I believe so, and I can tell you I've travelled quite a distance to get here to Yoorana. 
 Have you, now? Holiday or business? 
 Legacy, actually. 
 The family manor. I believe you are planning to sell. 
 No, not planning. The deal is already done. 
 Is that so? 
 Well, the fact is, madam, it may not be solely yours to dispose of. 
 Really? 
 Really. 
 Patrick Michael Fitzgerald produced progeny, other descendants who continue to this very day, and who are still alive and living here in Yoorana. 
 Is that so? 
 Yes, it is, and I have living proof. 
 The time has finally come for the two branches of the family tree to meet. 
 Beau, get in here. Meet your cousin. 
 You're the boy who broke into the property. 
 It was his idea. 
 Madam, this young man is your blood relation. 
 He is, in fact, your cousin. 
 As such, he is entitled. 
 Please don't waste any more of my time. 
 No, no... 
 How dare you try and blackmail me, parading some poor unfortunate, as a blood relation? 
 It's simply ludicrous. You should be ashamed of yourself. 
 Now, I am going to the police this minute and I'm going to make a formal complaint against both of you. 
 No, no, no, no, you don't understand. You're not even listening. 
 This boy is a Fitzgerald -- a Fitzgerald through and through! 
 Your own flesh and blood! 
 Do not attempt to follow or harass me or any member of my family again. 
 Did you see that? She's a Fitzgerald alright. 
 She'll squeal on her own family. 
 Ah, she's not the only one who can call the coppers. 
 Come on. 
 Do you need something for your hand? 
 No. 
 Just clean it up. 
 Nothing you can do will fix that. 
 What are you doing? 
 Have you never seen a diabetic before? 
 It's nothing. 
 Well, it's not nothing. 
 It's the only reason I didn't join up when I was younger. 
 I mean, they could have let me in as IT or admin or something. 
 (Glucose monitor beeps) 
 With my brain, and with my father a commissioned officer, a bloody hero. 
 How could Charlie be a hero if he didn't die in the war? 
 He was the only bloke to make it back to Yoorana. 
 That's something. 
 He had that statue commissioned and then he died before it went up, poor b*st*rd. 
 So, how did Charlie die? 
 (Laughs) I was hoping you could tell me. 
 I'll show you how this works. I'll take your blood sugar. 
 OK. Alright. Off you go. 
 Go on, piss off. 
 (Door opens and closes) 
 We have to go. 
 (Feedback whistles) 
 Hello? 
 Elishia. 
 What's going on? 
 Where are the others? Is Kate with you? 
 No. 
 Hello, James. 
 Vic, what... what's this about? 
 You tell me. 
 What are you doing here? 
 Looking for what you've been hiding. 
 Why? 
 I have my reasons. 
 Listen, Vic, we've just been trying to protect these people, that's all. 
 These aren't people -- not real, living people. 
 Why would you say that? 
 Because I know things that you don't know, and I'm pretty sure that this doctor here knows more than she's admitting. 
 What does that mean? 
 Don't listen to him. He wants to kill Kate. 
 How can I kill something that's already dead? 
 Vic, you're bleeding. 
 Where is Kate Willis? 
 Where is Patrick Fitzgerald? Where is Charlie Thompson? 
 Where is Kirstie Darrow? 
 What about Maria? 
 Has something happened to Maria? 
 No. 
 Then why didn't you mention her? 
 (Footsteps approach) 
 Hello? 
 Patrick Fitzgerald? 
 Run! Run, run, run, run, run! 
 Oh! 
 (Gun fires) 
 f*ck! 
 (Gun fires) 
 Vic! 
 Arggh! 
 (Bone cracks) 
 Arggh! 
 (Groans) 
 Eh? Planning on a murder, were you? 
 Paddy, don't! He's a policeman, Paddy! 
 Give me the gun. 
 (Groans and coughs) 
 He should have called by now. 
 (Dials number) 
 (Mobile phone rings) 
 OK, come on. 
 James said we should stay here... 
 I know what he said, but if there's any trouble, we can't stay here. 
 We can go to James's shack. I think I know where that is. 
 It's off the old highway. 
 Right. How do you know? 
 What? 
 Well, James only got that place a year ago. 
 How do you know where it is? 
 Oh, I went there. 
 With James? 
 Yeah, with James. 
 Was it on Wednesday? 
 Um... I'm not sure what day it was. 
 'Cause James didn't come home on Wednesday... all night. 
 Did you sleep with him? 
 Sarah... 
 Did you f*ck my husband? 
 YOUR husband? 
 Get out. 
 Get the f*ck out of my car! 
 (Vic groans) 
 James : On the couch. 
 Arggh! 
 That's it. 
 (Groans) 
 Put him down, put him down. 
 Arggh! 
 I'll go get some painkillers. 
 (Wails) 
 You two keep an eye on him. 
 Are you alright? 
 Yes. 
 Are you sure? 
 Yes, I'll be back. There's something I have to do. 
 Charlie : I commissioned this statue. 
 So, who was this bloke? 
 His name was George. 
 Right. 
 Did George kill you? 
 No. 
 Did you kill him? 
 No, I loved him. 
 And he loved me. 
 Hey, Sar. You look huge. 
 Really? I had no idea(!) 
 No James? 
 No, he's got a lot on. 
 Hey, listen, I was just at home and I thought I heard someone inside. 
 In the house? 
 Yeah. 
 I came back in, there was no-one there, but then I heard Smudge out the front. 
 Did you see anyone? 
 Yeah, I saw someone riding off on a bike. 
 A yellow Suzuki. 
 Did you get a plate? 
 R-J... 
 Yep? 
 .. 652. 
 Do you think it was the same person did the break-in? 
 Possibly. 
 OK. 
 Alright, well, I'll run the plates and put a call-out for it. 
 Thank you. 
 Oh, hey! 
 Some of the new batch. 
 Thanks. (Breathes deeply) 
 Everything alright with the baby? 
 Yeah, it's fine. 
 See ya. 
 See ya. 
 (Flies buzz) 
 Just gonna need you to remove your helmet. 
 Hello, Chris. 
 You've f*cked up, big time! 
 I don't care. 
 It's a record of my return! 
 What's that prove? 
 The rights to my own estate. 
 We need to get my phone back. 
 Beau : Rory nicked it. 
 Why don't you get it back for us? Or I'll gut you! 
 Vic, the man I know, is not a killer. You're gonna operate on him. 
 John : Do you think he'll survive? 
 Long enough to kill you all. 
 What if what happened to Maria's gonna happen to us? 
 Can't you see that your coming back is wrong? 
 We can't share you, James. I'm not gonna share you. 
 If you want to know what happened when you died, use it. 
 I can see your baby's head crowning. 
 (Baby wails)
