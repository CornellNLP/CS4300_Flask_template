 Previously on Devious Maids... 
 I saw you kissing Dr. Sanders in the street. 
 I was supportive when you first gave your power of attorney to Lucinda because I thought she had your best interests at heart. 
 My father kicked me out of this house because of you. 
 I don't want her to leave. 
 It's Didi. 
 I wish she was the one going away. 
 An opportunity might present itself. 
 What's wrong? 
 There's a problem with my kidneys. 
 Seems the little buggers are starting to shut down. 
 Sounds like she's more than a boss to you. 
 So much more. 
 I'm moving out tonight. 
 I'm really sorry that we couldn't be friends. 
 He knows. 
 He suspects. 
 You think they're having an affair? 
 Oh, I know they are. 
 I need to catch her in the unholy act so she will be crushed and I will win. 
 Carter killed Alejandro. 
 That might not be how the rest of us remember it. 
 Kind of pathetic, don't you think... 
 Screwing the help? 
 Hey, you're out of line. 
 He's trying to take you away from me. 
 He doesn't love you like I do. 
 I don't want to go back home. 
 Well, for obvious reasons, I can't let you stay here anymore. 
 Well, you need something to take your mind off all this drama with Ty. 
 And a fabulous show-biz party is just what the doctor ordered. 
 You doing okay? 
 I'm just glad he's gone. 
 Oh, thanks, Zoila, but I can't Friday. 
 Spence is having a party for the cast and crew of his show. 
 Yeah. 
 Can we get together tomorrow? 
 Okay. 
 Hold on. 
 I have to call you back. 
 Carmen, what a small world. 
 Are you following me? 
 Why would you think that? 
 'Cause I also saw you at the market this morning. 
 Oh. And at the movies last night. 
 What do you think you're doing? 
 Okay. 
 Yes, I-I've been waiting for the right time to talk to you, but just to help you understand how I feel. 
 It doesn't matter how you feel. 
 I don't feel anything. 
 Carmen. 
 I date men. 
 And I'm sorry, Ty, but all I see when I look at you is a confused little boy. 
 Now, stop following me! 
 What are we doing here, Ty? 
 I thought we weren't gonna hang for a while. 
 This is sort of an emergency. 
 Have you been reading the papers, man? 
 The cops asked the FBI to help find out who's doing the home invasions. 
 The FBI! Okay? 
 We can't be seen together. 
 Clearly we're all still freaked out over what happened, so... 
 Fine. 
 I'll get to the point. 
 I want us to hit another house. 
 Are you high? 
 Last time we went out, Carter killed somebody. 
 Hey, was I the moron who put real bullets in the gun? 
 No one told you to point it at... 
 Shut up, both of you! 
 Our Robin hood days are over. 
 No, they're not. 
 And here's why. 
 I will go to the cops and turn us all in if you don't help me. 
 You're crazy. 
 So the doctors tell me. 
 Every cop in the city is on alert. 
 One more house. 
 If you help me do this, we're golden. 
 [Inhales deeply] 
 Let's say we put the masks on one more time. 
 Who would we be robbing? 
 My Uncle Spence. 
 [cellphone beeps] 
 What did the doctor say? 
 I'm not a match. 
 I'm so sorry. 
 It's all right, darling. 
 I'll just get a kidney from someone else. 
 Maybe I should get tested. 
 You're sweet to offer, but I know how much Tequila you put away on the weekends. 
 I'd prefer to have a kidney that wasn't so abused. 
 For the record, I drink Tequila on the weekends because I spend my weekdays with you. 
 [Sighs] 
 Why not call one of our cousins from Oklahoma? 
 They might be a match. 
 I detest that part of the family. 
 If I let them give me a major organ, they'll think they have the right to visit me and use my pool. 
 Mom, this is your health that we're talking about. 
 I just think it would be easier to buy one from a stranger. 
 Zoila. 
 You must know someone who's strapped for cash in the barrio. 
 Santo dios. 
 Oh, good. 
 Give him a call. 
 Mom, people aren't allowed to sell their organs. 
 Why? 
 Poor people have organs. 
 Rich people need them. 
 Why must the government always stand in the way of the small businessman? 
 Hey, why don't we call Uncle Henri? No. 
 I don't want anyone in the family knowing about this. 
 Promise me you won't say anything. 
 Okay. 
 But you have to start taking this thing seriously, mom. 
 I mean, what are we gonna do if your kidneys fail completely? 
 Relax. 
 I gave up food in the '80s. 
 I see no reason why I can't give up fluids, as well. 
 Give me Henri's number. 
 I just promised mom I wouldn't call him. 
 Yeah, but I didn't. 
 I will be making a decision about a nurse very soon. 
 My husband gets home from the hospital on Friday. 
 You must be so excited. 
 I am. 
 But it won't be a quick recovery, so I'm going to need someone who can... 
 Put him at ease, lift his spirits. 
 [Sternly] I can do that. 
 Uh-huh. 
 Well, I have someone else waiting to be interviewed, so... 
 Somebody get me a jacket. 
 [Door closes] 
 'Cause that lady is frosty! 
 Hi. 
 Sorry to keep you waiting. 
 I'm sorry to eavesdrop, but miss congeniality was loud. 
 Oh, was that too catty? 
 Shoot! Now you know I'm a bitch. 
 Name's Molly. 
 Marisol. 
 Please, sit down. 
 Nice to meet you. 
 Oh, I hope so. 
 The last lady I worked for, she said I was too brassy. 
 I think I'm just fun, but she was the one with lupus, so... 
 Well, I think you're delightful. 
 And I'm ready to have someone working here who makes me laugh. 
 I recently parted ways with a very nasty employee. 
 Fought the urge to kick her several times a day. 
 Really? 
 Shoot. 
 Now you know I'm a bitch. 
 Self-deprecating. 
 I love that. [Laughs] 
 Here is my resumee and my references. 
 So, cards on the table, I really want this job. 
 You just seem so nice, and I love the way you dress. 
 And if there's anything you want to know about me, just go ahead and ask. 
 Well, I do have one question. 
 When can you start? 
 [Gasps] Ooh! 
 [Chuckles] 
 Adrian, have you seem the paper? 
 Nicholas Deering was hit by a car. 
 We should run over there later and drop off some sort of bouquet. 
 Marisol is allergic to roses, so... that seems the logical choice. 
 What's wrong? 
 I know you're sleeping with Tony. 
 So? 
 So, you have to stop seeing him. 
 Mm... I'd rather not. 
 Evelyn! 
 Tony makes me happy. 
 And as it turns out, I like to be happy. 
 What am I supposed to do? 
 Just stand here while you screw the help? 
 Isn't that where I stood while you screwed the help? 
 That was different. 
 How? 
 I don't know. 
 Don't worry. 
 Lots of people have open marriages these days. 
 I'm sure you will find a way to adjust. 
 And if it will cheer you up, I'll let you try to seduce Valentina. 
 She'll probably quit, but her cleaning is subpar, so I won't care. 
 Why would Tony want to be with you? 
 He finds me attractive. 
 Which part? 
 Your vicious tongue? 
 Your acidic personality? 
 Or that ice cube that lies where your heart ought to be? 
 You finished trying to hurt me now? 
 You misunderstand me. 
 I'm saying only a man like me can be attracted to a woman like you. 
 S-semi annual c-clearance sale. 
 Very good, Mr. Kenneth. 
 What's going on? Rosie's using the coupons that come in the mail to help Uncle Ken do his speech therapy. 
 20 p-percent off shoes. 
 Wonderful! 
 And I'll take that. 
 Reg, I saw you left a bag in Lucinda's room. 
 Are you planning on staying with us? 
 Just for a couple days. 
 My apartment's being painted. 
 Really? 
 'Cause I ran into Althea, and she says you don't live there anymore. 
 Your friend has no idea what she's talking about. 
 [Telephone rings] 
 Well, I never knew her to make stuff up. 
 Hello? 
 Let me get her. 
 Mm. 
 It's Dr. Sanders. 
 Oh, why would he be calling me? 
 Thank you. 
 This is Didi Miller. 
 Well, I'm very sorry, doctor, but my husband is doing better, and we no longer require your services. 
 [Telephone beeps] 
 Why is he calling you? 
 It's nothing. 
 Got to run. See y'all later. 
 You said you stopped seeing him. 
 We'll talk about it later, Rosie! 
 We sure will. 
 What do you mean you told him? 
 I mean Adrian confronted me about the affair, and I confessed. 
 W-why would you do that? 
 Because I adore you, and I'm sick of sneak around in the shadows. 
 Our relationship needs the sun in order to grow. 
 How did Mr. Powell react? 
 There were a few barbed remarks, but not much in the way of emotion. 
 We are jaded sophisticates, after all. 
 Tony? 
 Why aren't you smiling? 
 This is good news. 
 Of course. 
 This is a wonderful thing. 
 I have an idea. 
 Tonight, when we make love, let's leave the door open. 
 Why? 
 Adrian's never heard me orgasm before. 
 I thought it might be instructive. 
 That was a joke. 
 Why aren't you laughing? 
 I'm sorry. 
 It's just... I really never thought you'd tell him. 
 [Sighs] 
 What are you doing here? 
 Guys asked me to talk to you. 
 About what? 
 We can't pull another job. 
 I'm sorry. 
 Wasn't it the three of you who asked me to help you rob rich people in the first place? 
 I know, but... 
 "We can fight income inequality. 
 We can help the poor." 
 And I remember everything you used to say to me. 
 But then someone got killed. 
 I told you what will happen if you bail on me. 
 Damn it, Ty! 
 We're your friends. 
 Jason just got accepted into Yale, Carter's gonna be an intern at C.A.A. this summer, and I've met a girl that's really special. 
 Our lives are just beginning. 
 Why would you want to ruin them? 
 What about my life? 
 When does it begin? 
 Sorry? 
 I met a girl, too, and I'm totally in love with her. 
 That's... great. 
 I think she would love me if she just saw me differently. 
 Wait. 
 You want us to risk going to jail just so you can impress some chick? 
 Don't talk to me like I'm stupid. 
 I thought this through. 
 Then enlighten me. 
 How does us robbing your Uncle get you this girl? 
 Simple. 
 I'm gonna save her life. 
 Read me another one. 
 No, no. 
 That's a catalogue for women's underwear. 
 There are no words, just pictures. 
 I know. 
 [Door closes] Oh. 
 I'll be right back. 
 Here's some real mail to practice on. 
 Did you see Dr. Sanders? 
 Yes. 
 Mrs. Didi, you promised! 
 I ended the affair weeks ago, but bill started calling again. 
 I went over there to tell him to leave me the hell alone. 
 And that's all that happened? 
 No hanky panky? 
 No. 
 I swear. 
 'Cause if Mr. Kenneth ever found out you cheated, it would hurt him so much. 
 I know. 
 And I admit the affair was wrong, but come on. 
 Haven't you ever made a mistake? 
 [Sighs] 
 Okay. 
 But if you want to stay with Mr. Kenneth, you can have nothing to do with that man. 
 Don't take his calls, don't go to his house, even to yell at him. 
 In time, he will get the message. 
 Thanks for looking out for me. 
 It's not you I'm looking out for. 
 [Sighs] 
 Hey. 
 So, I set up the adjustable bed in the guest room and brought in some I.V. stands. 
 Anything else we need, we can get after Nicholas gets home. 
 Molly, you're a godsend. 
 Aww. 
 What's all this? 
 My book. 
 You're a writer? No way! 
 Well, I'm trying to be. 
 I used to work for a writer... 
 Shel Sumac, the presidential historian. 
 I've heard of him. 
 Was he nice? 
 When he was sober, which was never. 
 [Chuckling] Really? 
 Oh, yeah. 
 [Slurred] 
 Oh, I-I won a Pulitzer. 
 You must've worked for a lot of crazies. 
 Oh, okay, you know Sara Innskeep, the actress? 
 Nympho! 
 No. Yeah. She was totally into bondage. 
 She used to have these guys come over to the house, and they would smack her around. 
 I mean, I was appalled, un-until I saw her new sitcom, and then I felt like slugging her myself. 
 [Laughs] 
 You know, that's crazy. 
 That's sort of what my book is about... 
 Working for the rich and famous and seeing their insanity up close and personal. 
 Oh. That sounds juicy. Mm. 
 Well, I should probably stop bothering you. 
 No. 
 It's so nice to finally have someone in this house that I can talk to. 
 Yeah, you said you didn't care for the woman who used to work here. 
 Opal. 
 She had... issues. 
 Sounds like there's a good story there. 
 I shouldn't gossip. 
 Oh, please. 
 Just between us girls. 
 [Inhales deeply] 
 Well... Opal had an unusually close relationship with the first Mrs. Deering. 
 Genevieve's fine. 
 She's just not at the top of the donor list,  so keep your fingers crossed, mija. 
 [Doorbell rings] 
 Someone's at the door. 
 I got to run. 
 Oh, my God. 
 I am so sorry. 
 For what? 
 Remember, this only happened because I don't want you to die. 
 What happened? 
 No, you have to promise to forgive me first. 
 Zoila, what's going on? 
 Well... I sort of called Henri. 
 You did what?! 
 And I told him you didn't want the family to know. 
 Please tell me he didn't call her. 
 Where is everybody?! 
 Oh, for crap sake. 
 This place has more doors than a whorehouse. 
 And with that much makeup, you'd be the star attraction. 
 Hello, mother. 
 Sorry I'm late. 
 Why are you dressed like that? 
 I'm being stalked by Ty. 
 I don't want him to recognize me. 
 Then stop wearing makeup. 
 How will that help? 
 I've seen you without makeup. 
 You are unrecognizable. 
 I can't wait to be your age. 
 Then I won't have to worry about men following me. 
 So, then Marisol gets a call from the police. 
 Turns out her fiance's in the hospital. 
 Shh! 
 That woman is talking about Marisol. 
 So, even though he lied to her, she marries him just because he's been hit by a car. 
 [Laughter] Hey. 
 Would you like to hear about our specials? 
 Can you come back later? 
 We're trying to listen to a private conversation. 
 [Laughing] 
 I mean, who does that? 
 I mean, who gets married in a hospital? It's crazy. 
 [Doorbell rings] 
 You alphabetize your skin-care products? 
 Huh? 
 And why would you eat a box of girl scout cookies for breakfast? 
 I've been under a lot of stress lately, and how do you know that? 
 Your new nurse has a big mouth. 
 Molly has been gossiping about me? 
 With her friends at the cafe. 
 So, you want to pour me a scotch? 
 I know you have 16 bottles. 
 Whoa, whoa, wait. 
 Molly didn't reveal anything embarrassing, did she? 
 She told them about your impromptu wedding and your doubts about Nick. 
 Oh, my God. 
 But on a positive note, she really likes your book. 
 My book is in galleys. 
 Nobody's read m... 
 Oh, my God. 
 Come on. 
 It's time to break out the cookies and the scotch. 
 [Sighs] 
 [Crunching] 
 
 
 
 Mr. Powell? 
 Are you okay? 
 You seem depressed. 
 It's one of the side effects of total emasculation. 
 I'm sorry. 
 I don't know that word. 
 It's what happens to a man when he becomes a cuckold. 
 Oh. 
 Don't know that one either, do you? 
 Not a clue. 
 My wife is betraying me with another man. 
 I've lost all semblance of dignity. No. 
 You're still dignified. 
 It's funny. 
 I've been married to Evelyn all these years, but I didn't know how much I loved her until I saw her in the arms of another man. 
 I think it's good you know that. 
 Now you can fight for her. 
 No, it's too late. 
 You know what I do when life seems hopeless? 
 I pray. 
 Oh. 
 Poor people have the most interesting hobbies. 
 Maybe you should ask God for guidance. 
 Mm, after the life I've led, I'd be embarrassed to ask for God's help. 
 Well, if you don't mind, I'm gonna pray for you. 
 I would like that. 
 You are a paragon of munificence. 
 That means you're nice. 
 Oh. 
 [Chuckles] 
 When are they going to finish painting your apartment? 
 You're not trying to get rid of me, are you? 
 No. 
 I like having you here. 
 Good. 
 'Cause I like being here. 
 [Doorbell rings] 
 I'll get it. 
 Can I help you? 
 [Slurring] Where's Didi? 
 She's not here. 
 You're Dr. Sanders, right? 
 You used to take care of my Uncle Ken. 
 She won't return my calls, and I have to see her. 
 Mrs. Didi told you she does not want you to... 
 Be her doctor anymore! 
 You have to leave! 
 Didi?! 
 I don't think so, buddy. 
 [Grunts] 
 That was weird, huh? 
 What was that? 
 It is none of our business. 
 That man tried to break into my family's home. 
 It's absolutely my business. 
 Okay. 
 But you've got to promise not to tell anyone. 
 I promise. 
 What's going on? 
 When Mr. Kenneth was sicker, it was very hard on Mrs. Didi. 
 She got lonely. 
 Got friendly with the good doctor? 
 But it's over now, and she's so sorry. 
 Uncle Ken doesn't know? 
 That's why you can't say anything. 
 Mr. Kenneth will be so hurt. 
 Look, grandma. 
 Zoila made fried chicken and corn on the cob in your honor. 
 If I really mattered, one of you would've called me a week ago to say that my daughter's dying. 
 I'm not that sick, mother. 
 Don't lie. 
 I can see it in your body. 
 You're wasting away. 
 This is my normal weight, mother. 
 You should've seen her when she was six. 
 Everyone called her the butterball express. 
 Not everyone, mother. 
 Just you. 
 You used to be fat? 
 I was zaftig. 
 German women are zaftig. 
 You were fat. 
 Do you want some iced tea? 
 Only if it's laced with valium. 
 Don't know why you're so angry at me. 
 I haven't seen you for two years. 
 Well, you're here now. 
 So, why don't we just enjoy this... 
 Ridiculously unhealthy meal. 
 You need more fat in your diet. 
 Women look better when they're a little chubby. 
 Well, like Zoila here. 
 Where did you say we keep that valium? 
 I'm sorry I'm not in a good mood. 
 It's been a stressful time. 
 Bull. 
 You just don't want me to visit, and I know why. 
 'Cause I don't let you act like a phony. 
 What are you talking about? 
 You put on airs, use big words like your rich, snobby friends. 
 Her name isn't really Genevieve, you know. 
 What? 
 Knock it off, mother. 
 She got "Genevieve" from a romance novel. 
 Her real name is eunice. 
 Eunice Mudge. 
 I'll put you in a nursing home, so help me. 
 She made her brother, Henry, change his name, too. 
 Big phony. 
 One with bars on the windows! 
 See how she talks to me? 
 All I want to do is enjoy my corn on the cob, and I can't because she's got to yell at me. 
 Do you know why I yell, mother? 
 It's because I'm trying to rise above the muck and mire of my childhood to create a life of elegance and refinement and... 
 For God's sakes, mother, what are you doing? 
 I got something stuck on my choppers. 
 Grandma, put your teeth back in. 
 Sorry, folks. 
 After 80, corn is not your friend. 
 I can't do this. 
 Where are you going? 
 I can't. 
 Not anymore. 
 I'm sorry. 
 Are you all right? 
 I want her out of this house. 
 She's your mother. 
 You can't kick her out. 
 You're right. 
 I can't, but you can. 
 Hold on a second. 
 You brought her here. 
 You get rid of her. 
 And that's an order. 
 I brought you into my home because I trusted you. 
 Now I find out that you're sharing the most private parts of my life with total strangers? 
 And judging me? 
 I am super sorry, but you might want to climb down off that high horse you're on. 
 High horse? 
 I read your book, remember? 
 You write about all those loons you used to work for in Beverly Hills when you were a maid. 
 You discuss in detail their lives and their problems, and going by your tone, you judge them plenty. 
 All I did was tell the truth about the things that I saw. 
 So, you're better than me because you put your gossip down on paper? 
 Look, it's okay. 
 We all do it. 
 Everybody talks about other people's lives. 
 You're right. 
 I'm a hypocrite. 
 It's okay. 
 I won't tell anyone. 
 I know you won't, because you're gonna sign a confidentiality agreement. 
 Come on. 
 For you to work here, I need to know that you're not gonna talk about my private life, or anyone else's. 
 I gave up coke. 
 I guess I can give up gossip. 
 You know, for all the high-profile folks that you've worked for, I'm surprised that no one has made you sign a confidentiality agreement before. 
 Oh, one guy did... 
 A rock star in Bel Air. 
 His mansion was orgy city. 
 Molly! 
 Sorry. 
 I just can't give it up cold Turkey. 
 Mr. Kenneth. 
 The mail is here. 
 It's time to do our therapy. 
 Mr. Kenneth. 
 Are we ready? 
 Any c-c-catalogues? 
 Not the kind you're looking for, you dirty old man. 
 [Chuckles] 
 What shall we read today? 
 Credit-card offers, bills. 
 Oh. 
 You've got some sort of letter. 
 Why don't you read this to me, hmm? 
 "Dear... Kenneth." 
 Very good. 
 You didn't stutter that time. 
 "I'm writing to let you know that..." 
 No, no, don't stop. 
 You're doing so good. 
 Mr. Kenneth? 
 Oh, Mr. Kenneth, I'm so sorry. 
 Thank you, Tony. 
 Of course, Mrs. Powell. 
 Oh, I can't wait to see what Marisol has done to this place. 
 I have a sinking feeling she's festooned the interior with pinatas. 
 Mr. Powell. 
 We obviously haven't had the chance to speak, and I just wanted to say I'm sorry about the position I've put you in. 
 Honestly, I'm more concerned about the positions you've put my wife in. 
 Evelyn, Adrian. 
 Someone I don't know, hi. 
 We heard about what happened to Nick. 
 Even though we haven't spoken to him in years, we were very concerned. 
 You're sweet to stop by. 
 Please, come in. 
 [Door closes] 
 Allow me to introduce our driver, Dick. 
 Tony. 
 Oh, of course. 
 What was I thinking? 
 We brought you a little something... 
 Just our way of letting Nicholas know we're thinking of him. 
 They're absolutely gorgeous. 
 Molly! 
 Would you mind putting these in some water? 
 I think there's a vase in the dining room. 
 So thoughtful. 
 Roses. 
 Tony, wait for us outside. 
 We'll only be a moment. 
 Of course. 
 Please, come sit. 
 Oh. 
 Marisol, I love what you've done with the place. 
 I haven't changed a thing. 
 I know. 
 I'll be back in a moment. 
 I need to use the facilities. 
 Molly, was it? 
 May I help you? 
 Forgive me, but I couldn't help notice. 
 Sorry about that. 
 No, no, no, it's all right. 
 I take it you know Tony? 
 Look, I'm not supposed to gossip. 
 But... 
 When I knew him, his name wasn't Tony. 
 You must tell me more. 
 Hello, Mr. Powell. 
 Good evening, Valentina. 
 I wanted you to know I've been praying for you. 
 Well, you could stop now, my dear. 
 It worked. 
 There's been an unexpected complication. 
 Her husband has found out about the affair. 
 No, it's fine. 
 I just have to come up with a new plan. 
 Oh, believe me, I am counting down the minutes till I can dump this bitch. 
 [Door opens] 
 Hello, darling. 
 Hello, my love. 
 Hey, you. 
 Where's my daughter? 
 In her room, resting. 
 Yeah, I'll bet. 
 She is. 
 This kidney thing, it's really taking its toll. 
 In fact... I was thinking maybe you should come back some other time, when she's better. 
 Did she tell you to throw me out? 
 [Scoffs] 
 My daughter, the class act. 
 Well, can you blame her? 
 I'm sure you mean well, but you are... 
 A pain in the ass? 
 Times 10. 
 I was a single mom in the '50s. 
 There weren't many of us back then. 
 I'd look for work, and people would tell me "get a husband." 
 I'd get work, and my boss would try to pinch my ass, or worse. 
 I had to be tough for my kids. 
 But they're grown. 
 Can't you relax and take pride in a job well done? 
 I'm not so proud of how "Genevieve" turned out. 
 She's a wonderful human being. 
 And so what if she moved to L.A. to reinvent herself? 
 She's allowed. 
 She's not allowed to be ashamed of me. 
 She's not allowed to forget what I did for her, how I put clothes on her back a-and a roof over her head. 
 I'm not sure what she remembers about her childhood, but I'm sure she loves you. 
 I would like her love. 
 But I demand her respect. 
 [Bottle slams] 
 If she wants me to leave, she can tell me herself. 
 Genevieve : Well? 
 Did you throw her out? 
 I'm sorry. 
 I couldn't do it. 
 Why not? 
 Do you know what the fifth commandment is? 
 It's thou shalt honor they mother and thy father. 
 Zoila, you've seen how she is. 
 How could I honor that? 
 By remembering everything that she did right and forgiving her for everything that she did wrong. 
 Because one day, she will die, and if you haven't done everything that you can to build a relationship with that woman, honey... 
 You will be so sad. 
 Didi : [Voice breaking] 
 Please, look. 
 If you talk to Kenny... 
 If you just talk to him... 
 You can just tell him it doesn't make any sense. 
 Look, you signed this. 
 [Crying] 
 I'll be right back. 
 Please. 
 I love my husband. 
 I love him. 
 What's going on? 
 [Sighs] 
 Uncle Ken asked me and his business managers to inform Didi that he wants a divorce. 
 [Gasps] No. 
 Because of that letter? 
 We're going over the prenup she signed. 
 She's leaving tomorrow. 
 But Didi knows she made a mistake. 
 Didn't she tell him that? 
 He doesn't care. 
 Now that he knows she was unfaithful, it's over. 
 I feel so bad. 
 I know. 
 It's awful. 
 That's why I'm gonna stick around here a while longer. 
 Uncle Ken needs family right now. 
 Oh, o-okay. 
 I-I got to get back. 
 Uh, would you mind bringing my briefcase upstairs for me? 
 Sure. 
 Oh, you forgot your pad. 
 [Crying] 
 Please, just talk to him. 
 Didi, do you see this? 
 This is your signature. 
 But I love him. 
 But you signed it, and these are legal documents. 
 [Indistinct conversation] 
 Zoila, I can't find the remote. 
 I told you. 
 I put it on the table next to your chair. 
 Well, I don't think you did, but... 
 Psst! 
 I've been thinking. 
 You were right. 
 I can't kick my mother out of my house. 
 It would be something I'd regret for the rest of my life. 
 Good girl. 
 But I need more time to figure out how to handle her, so... 
 What's that? 
 I'm going to the four seasons for a few weeks. 
 Wait! 
 Who's gonna take care of your mother? 
 Zoila! 
 It's not here! 
 I hope in time, you'll find a way to forgive me. 
 No! 
 Zoila! 
 [Up-tempo music plays] 
 So nice to meet you. 
 Hey. 
 I know you. 
 You work on Spence's show. 
 Hi. I can't believe I'm meeting Dr. 
 Blake McDye, the evil, bipolar heart surgeon. 
 I hate you so much. 
 Uh... thank you. 
 Hi, Carmen. 
 Damn it, Ty! 
 If you don't leave now, I'm gonna call the police. 
 I'm only here because I left my chemistry textbook in my room. 
 I'll only be a minute. 
 I-I'm not here to bother you. 
 Honest. 
 Make it fast. 
 [Indistinct conversations] 
 [Keypad clicking] 
 [Cellphone chimes] 
 All right. 
 He's good. 
 I got the code to the gate, so getting in is gonna be a piece of cake. 
 Here's how it's gonna go down. 
 Ty wants to be the big hero tonight, so we're gonna go in and follow our normal game plan, and then I'm gonna grab the maid and threaten her. 
 Whoa, man, nobody's supposed to get hurt. 
 Nobody will. 
 "Our hero" is gonna overpower me and save the day, and then we run out. 
 Ty's gonna overpower you? 
 Is anybody gonna believe that? 
 If that's what he wants, then that's what's gonna happen. 
 And then we're done with that clown forever, you got it? 
 Good. 
 [Indistinct conversations in distance] 
 You said one minute. 
 I know it's here somewhere. 
 Look, if this is just some excuse to talk to me, I'm... 
 Oh. 
 Well, I-I guess you can go now. 
 Carmen, listen. 
 I'm sorry I've been upsetting you, but I'm really not the creepy kid you think I am. 
 I'm a man. 
 And I just keep hoping that one day, you'll see me that way. 
 But if you don't even want to be friends with me, then I'll understand. 
 Spence : Carmen! 
 People want cake. 
 [Sighs] 
 We'll see. 
 Just give me some time. 
 It's not really my height. 
 Where were you? 
 I'll tell you later. 
 Let's cut the cake. 
 Yeah. 
 Everyone on your knees! 
 [People gasping, screaming] 
 What the hell is this? 
 [Gunshot] 
 [People scream] 
 On your knees, people! 
 Wallets and jewelry in the bag, now! 
 What are you doing? 
 I'm not letting this happen again. 
 Put that away! 
 911. What's your emergency? 
 Ah! Nice try. 
 Hey, hey, just... just let her... [people scream] 
 Listen up, morons! 
 If anyone tries anything, we will shoot her! 
 Let her go! 
 Ty, get down. 
 You're gonna get the lady killed. 
 On your knees now. 
 So help me. 
 [Screams] 
 [People scream] 
 Screw this! 
 We've got to get out of here! 
 Stay down! 
 Dude, you're bleeding pretty bad. 
 We've got to get you to the hospital. 
 No, no, that's where the police will be looking. 
 Just drive. 
 I know where to go. 
 [Sirens wailing] 
 Yes, sir. 
 [Door closes] 
 And these home invaders didn't take anything? 
 They didn't have time. 
 After my maid stabbed the one guy, the other two ran out. 
 [Chuckles] 
 That's a good maid. 
 Might want to get yourself a gun for protection. Mm. 
 I got a 9 mil under my bed. 
 There just wasn't time to get it. 
 Yeah. 
 [Doorbell rings] 
 Excuse me. 
 Sure. 
 I heard what happened. 
 Is Carmen okay? 
 Oh, she's great. 
 She's great. 
 She saved the day, you know? 
 [Chuckles] I heard. 
 [Indistinct conversations] 
 A-are you all right? 
 Yeah, sure. Just a little shaken up. That's all. 
 Good. 
 I'm glad you weren't hurt. 
 Yeah? I thought you were still mad at me about that little dust-up I had with Reggie. 
 I think he needed a little dusting up. 
 I-it's good to see you, Spence. 
 Carmen. 
 The girls are on their way over. 
 Zoila's bringing tacos. 
 Marisol is bringing booze. 
 We're gonna take good care of you. 
 That's so sweet, but just being here is enough. 
 No, Carmen. 
 They put a gun to your head. 
 You're allowed to get a little drunk. 
 I wasn't that scared. 
 Mostly I was angry. 
 I knew in seconds those were the men who killed Alejandro. 
 But then this guy... 
 Decides to be a hero. 
 I mean, I fell on my face. 
 I didn't see anybody else stand up to those punks. 
 He distracted the leader, which gave me enough time to stab him. 
 You sound like a hero to me. 
 The detective got some good news. 
 He's confident they're gonna find the guys that did this. 
 But they were wearing masks. 
 How are you gonna find them? 
 Well, we're watching all the hospitals. 
 The one that got stabbed... 
 He's got to go somewhere. 
 Ethan? Ethan. Ethan! Ethan! 
 What is it?!
