 Marisol : Good morning, Opal. 
 Morning. 
 When does Nicholas get back? 
 Tomorrow. 
 9:53. 
 You sound eager to have him back. 
 I am. 
 We have lots to talk about. 
 I'm sure. 
 Coffee? 
 Smells wonderful. 
 It's a new blend I'm experimenting with. 
 Before I forget, thanks for taking my things to the hospital. 
 No big deal. 
 Yes, well... 
 When you were in my room, did you happen to open the top drawer of my bureau? 
 Excuse me? 
 I usually keep it locked. 
 Huh. 
 I don't know anything about it. 
 Why? 
 What's in that drawer? 
 Things. Private things. 
 Well, maybe you left it unlocked by accident. 
 Perhaps. 
 But if someone was in there, I'd be very angry. 
 Of course. 
 People need to feel comfortable in their own homes. 
 Well, then... 
 Enjoy the coffee. 
 Hey. 
 Morning, Valentina. 
 Where are you off to? 
 The grocery store. 
 Could you swing by Neiman's? 
 I need another jar of moisturizer. 
 Uh, this should cover it. 
 $300? 
 Why so expensive? 
 The main ingredient is nightingale droppings. 
 And you pay extra for that? 
 It is worth it. It helps my skin look 10 years younger. 
 So why don't you use it on your hands? 
 I do. 
 Please go. 
 See you in a couple of hours. 
 [Door opens and closes] 
 Remi, what are you doing here? 
 Can't I bring flowers to a pretty girl? 
 Not when she's dating someone else. 
 Friends give each other stuff, and... 
 We are still friends, right? 
 Of course we are. 
 By the way, I met Ethan. 
 You did? 
 Yeah, we had an interesting talk. 
 You know, I've got to be honest... 
 [Sighs] 
 Doesn't seem like such a good guy. 
 Is that why you came here?! 
 To insult my new boyfriend?! 
 I'm just looking out for you. 
 I mean, how well do you even know this guy? 
 I know that's he's sweet... and funny... and he gets me in a way that you don't. 
 Come on. I get you. 
 Ethan's mom is a maid, just like mine. 
 He knows what it's like to grow up wanting what you can't have. 
 Trust me. I've learned what that feels like. 
 Thank you for the flowers. 
 But don't come here unannounced. 
 [Gasps] 
 [Moaning] 
 Stop right there! 
 Do you really think I'm gonna let you walk in here with those dirty boots? 
 How else can I give you... your present? 
 You may enter. 
 [Chuckles] 
 Carmen : What's the occasion? 
 It's just a "Thank you" gift. 
 Ever since I came here, you've been so nice to me... 
 If I knew there were presents, I would have been nicer. 
 [Chuckles] 
 [Gasps] 
 [Lid clatters] 
 Iave Maria purísima! 
 Do you like it? 
 Like it? I want to be buried in it. 
 But... 
 I can't take this. 
 Why not? 
 Ty... 
 It looks expensive. 
 Would you prefer a cheaper gift? 
 Stop trying to trick me. 
 You've made a huge difference in my life. 
 So, please, just try it on. 
 Well, maybe just a sleeve. 
 Okay, the other one. 
 [Chuckles] 
 Oh, my God. 
 Ohh. 
 Oh, no! Now I've got a problem. 
 What's that? 
 I'm never taking this jacket off, and I still got floors to mop. 
 [Laughs] 
 Thank you. 
 Mm-hmm. 
 So, let me ask you this... 
 As a professional chef, is it hard to eat at someone else's restaurant? 
 Nah. 
 If the food's good, I have a great time. 
 And if it's not, I'm happy the competition sucks. 
 [Both chuckle] 
 What about you? As a professional housekeeper, do you judge the cleanliness of everybody's house? 
 Not always. 
 But every now and then... 
 What? 
 Javier, you have a lovely home. 
 It's warm and inviting... and covered in dirt. 
 You need a maid. 
 I have a maid. 
 You lie. 
 It's true. 
 Concepcion was here today. 
 Well, then I feel I must ask you, is she legally blind? 
 [Chuckles] 
 I know she's not the greatest cleaning lady in the world, but she's been with me for 10 years. 
 She's very loyal. 
 You want loyal? Get a dog. 
 You want a clean house? Get a real maid. 
 You're kind of a hard-ass. 
 If one of the cooks in your kitchen kept burning the food, would you keep them? 
 You're right. 
 I'll ask Concepcion to step up her game. 
 Don't ask. Tell. 
 Threaten to fire her if you have to. 
 [Chuckling] 
 Okay. Okay. 
 You really think it's that bad? 
 I do. I really do. 
 [Both chuckle] 
 Nurse : Mr. Powell? 
 It's time for your meds. 
 Ah, the blue ones my favorite. 
 Farewell, afternoon. 
 [Sighs] 
 Oh, and that's for you. 
 I'm a nurse, not a waitress. 
 Go ahead. Take it. 
 Buy yourself some shoes that don't squeak. 
 Mr. Powell? 
 Valentina! 
 Did you bring my books? 
 Got them right here. 
 Did you bring the other thing? 
 Slip it to me, slip it to me. 
 Glorious! 
 Why do I have to sneak these in? 
 They're just cookies. 
 My nurse won't allow processed sugar here. 
 Though she certainly seems to enjoy it at home. 
 So... you look relaxed. 
 How could I not? 
 I get massages every morning, lots of colorful sedatives every afternoon. 
 If I had known how much fun this was, I would have had a nervous breakdown ages ago. 
 So, why didn't Evelyn come? 
 Well... she couldn't get away. 
 Things are crazy back home. 
 Is Tony helping out? 
 He's supposed to be on top of things. 
 Oh, he is. 
 Are you all right? 
 Yeah. 
 I was just thinking... 
 It would be great if you came back home. 
 That's sweet. 
 I'm not quite ready yet. 
 Are you sure? 
 'Cause Mrs. Powell misses you. 
 More than she knows. 
 What an odd thing to say. 
 It was nice to see you, but I have to get back. 
 Enjoy your books. 
 Rosie. 
 [Gasps] 
 Spence. 
 I was just having dinner with my lawyer. 
 How are you doing? 
 Good. 
 You have a minute? 
 I need to explain some things Actually, I'm here with someone. 
 Didn't realize we had company. 
 Oh. 
 I'm Reggie. 
 Spence Westmore. 
 Oh, uh... 
 Spence is the man I used to work for. 
 Oh. 
 And Reggie is my... immigration lawyer. 
 Oh. 
 Well... thanks for stopping by. 
 Would you like a drink? 
 No, thanks. 
 Are you all right? 
 You were so quiet in the car. 
 Just trying to figure out where I stand. 
 In the dining room? 
 [Chuckles] 
 Where I stand with you. 
 W-we've been dating for a while now. 
 I thought I was more than just your "immigration lawyer." 
 Of course you are. 
 But this thing has been moving so slow. 
 Now I'm starting to think, is it because of that guy? 
 Spence and I were... together. 
 But it ended a while ago. 
 Now he's going through a bad divorce. 
 Oh. 
 And I couldn't tell him I'm dating such a wonderful man, especially now that he's all alone. 
 You think I'm wonderful? 
 Of course. 
 So, you and Spence... 
 Was it serious? 
 Well... 
 He did ask me to marry him. 
 I think I'll take that drink now. 
 [Vacuum whirring] 
 Oh, hey. 
 You want to read? I can go clean in the den. 
 Oh, yeah. That would be great. Thanks. 
 [Vacuum shuts off] 
 Hey. 
 Whose jacket? 
 Mine. 
 Hands off! 
 [Chuckles] 
 Wow. Am I paying you too much, or are you stealing from me? 
 It was a gift. 
 And you are definitely not paying me too much. 
 Someone gave you a $3,000 jacket? 
 It's $3,000?! 
 Yeah, it's a Yang Li. 
 Peri used to buy those when she was mad at me. 
 [Sighs] 
 She has a lot of them. 
 Wow. 
 So... 
 Who's your sugar daddy? 
 Uh... 
 Your nephew. 
 Ty is 17! 
 Why would you accept a gift like this? 
 I don't know! 
 He said something about helping him out of a dark place, and I wasn't really listening. 
 I was looking at the jacket! 
 He probably paid for it with his mother's credit card. 
 You want me to send her a thank-you card? 
 I want you to give it back. 
 But I love this jacket! 
 I don't care! 
 [Sighs] 
 Fine! 
 But if I ever do steal from you, this will be the reason. 
 Hey. 
 How do you feel about Ethan? 
 I barely know him. 
 Why? 
 Well, I had a run-in with him the other day, and I got this... weird vibe. 
 He's dating your ex. 
 Think that might've colored your opinion? 
 No, I swear. 
 I tried to give him the benefit of the doubt, but something about him... 
 Then I tried to warn Valentina, but she just got angry with me. 
 [Sighs] 
 Welcome to my world. 
 So, what should I do? 
 I promised Valentina I wouldn't meddle in her life. 
 Oh. 
 [Sighs] 
 But if I were free to give advice, it would sound something like this... 
 If you want Valentina back, you can't tell her what's wrong with Ethan. 
 You have to remind her of what's right with you. 
 [Chuckles] 
 That's the best advice I never got. 
 I'm glad. 
 And just so you know... 
 I'm rooting for you. 
 Hey, Beautiful. 
 Hey. 
 We have to talk. 
 I was hoping to unpack, maybe go for a run. 
 Can it wait? 
 No. It can't. 
 I know Dahlia's affair was with Opal. 
 Who told you that? 
 It doesn't matter. 
 What I want to know is why you didn't tell me. 
 [Sighs] 
 It was a humiliating discovery. 
 I don't like to discuss it. 
 No, you don't like to discuss it because it raises an obvious question. 
 Which is? 
 Why is your dead wife's lover still living in your house?! 
 Look... 
 Our marriage was far from perfect. 
 But I loved Dahlia. 
 When she died, I was devastated. 
 So was Opal. 
 I know it sounds strange, but... we helped each other get through it. 
 It was a bad time. 
 I get it. 
 But it's been 15 years. 
 Don't you think it's time to send Opal on her merry way? 
 But she's such a good housekeeper. 
 When someone makes you feel unwelcome and creeped out in your own house, they're not good at their job! 
 Marisol... 
 No! I'm serious! 
 I can no longer live under the same roof as that woman! 
 Okay. 
 I'll take care of it. 
 Everything is gonna be fine. 
 Okay. I know this croissant  looks big enough to feed four people, but I am not sharing. 
 Sorry. 
 What's going on? 
 This is my friend from church. 
 She's having a terrible day. 
 Her boss threatened to fire her. 
 Bandito. Poor Concepcion. 
 [Muffled] 
 Concepcion? 
 [Sniffles] 
 What is it she does for a living? 
 Same as us. She's a maid. 
 I'm... sorry to hear that. 
 Javier used to be such a nice boss,  but then la princesa filled his head with lies. 
 La princesa? Her boss's new girlfriend. She's a real bitch. How do we know that? La princesa threw a fit  because there were tiny water spots on the wine glasses. Well, maybe they weren't so tiny. Sorry. Croissant? I got to go. Miguel gets out of school early today. Bye. And she's my ride. Take care, Concepcion. And we'll pray for God to punish that girlfriend. Oh, don't do that. God is... so busy. I should go, too... Javier said I have to scrub every inch of the house by tomorrow, or I am fired. [Sobbing] W-what's wrong now? I wanted to go to San Diego tomorrow. Hey, priorities! I mean, your job is more important than some vacation. I was going to see my grandmother! She's dying! Well, that's not good. [Sobs] Maybe... Maybe she can hold on for one more day. No, no. You need to be with her. But who's gonna clean the house? Give me your key. Valentina : [Clears throat] Did you drop the books off for Mr. Powell? I did. He asked about you. Aww. You must be very happy. Are you talking to me? He loves you very much. At some point, I must have given you the impression I enjoy small talk with the help. And that's not the case. Will you please accept my apology as you leave to scrub my toilet? What are you doing here? Carmen told me where you worked. I really need to talk to you. You've got three minutes. You remember the day you came t-to my house? And you said all those terrible things? I remember. Peri made me say those things. She said that if you and I got together, she would take my son away. Oh. It killed me to hurt you like that. It turns out it was all pointless. Peri's gone to court to get sole custody of Tucker. Why didn't you tell me this before? I would have understood. I thought about calling you... but you never did. And it's been months! I'm so sorry. But you have to know I... I never stopped loving you. Reggie. Hi. Hello. Am I interrupting something? No. No. Spence was just leaving. Think about what I said? That guy seems to be popping up a lot lately. He had something he needed to tell me. Still, I'm not comfortable with the two of you hanging out together. I understand, but... It's not up to you who I see. You're giving it back? Why? Your uncle feels it's an inappropriate gift. No! You deserve beautiful things. I do. I really do. But... [Sighs] Wait! Just... Keep it in your closet. uncle Spence doesn't have to know. No! No, Ty! I can not accept a jacket this expensive. Even though it goes with everything I own. I'm sorry about this. I guess I screwed up. It's the thought that counts. And it's nice to know how you feel about me. Really? Yeah. I feel the same way about you. [Chuckles] Wow. [Chuckles] Every morning, you come out of your room and... You smile that goofy smile... It makes me happy. Sometimes, at night, I thank God for bringing you into my life. Awww. So who needs gifts? We've got each other, right? I thought you said we were going home. We are. Surprise! I don't understand. I just put an offer in this morning. Eight bedrooms, six baths, 5,000 square feet. Think of it as an early wedding gift. [Chuckles] You like it? I like the house we live in. Why would you want to sell it? I'm not going to. Opal's going to live there... with Ethan. Oh, my God. What? You said you didn't want to live under the same roof with her anymore. I wanted you to fire her, not give her a multimillion-dollar estate! Okay, but this way, everybody gets what they want and nobody's unhappy. What does this woman have on you? Nothing. Then why can't you get her out of your life? [Sighs] It's a confusing situation. No, it's not. Either she goes, or I do. I think we can all understand that. 
 
 So... Did you give the jacket back? I did. And how did Ty take it? Well... He decided to give me something else instead. I hope you said no. Well, it's hard to talk when someone's tongue is in your mouth. He kissed you? Oh, yeah. Why would he do that? [Scoffs] Not to be conceited, but... [chuckles] I mean, why would he think that you'd be interested? When I gave him the jacket back, you know, I was being really nice to him. And he misunderstood. I got it. I'll talk to him. You're going to be gentle, right? No! He kissed a woman old enough to be his... Maid! I'm old enough to be his maid! Oh. Sorry. Why don't I talk to Ty? You know, I've had a lot of guys hit on me. I know how to let him down easy. No, it has to be me. I've got to lay down the law... he's got to understand you don't go around kissing the help. Does he know you had a thing with Rosie? Or you could let him down easy. That's good, too. [Door closes] Mrs. Powell let me in. She shouldn't have. I don't have time to talk. Just one minute. Then I'll go, I swear. I'm not taking any more gifts from you. It's just a picture, and... I think you'll want to have it. Oh, my God. Is this...? That clearing we found in the Congo. Remember that morning? I do. You had just pulled an all-nighter at the clinic... And you came to meet me. But I was too tired to sleep, so... So we went for a walk. This was the most beautiful sunrise I'd ever seen. You know, I think about that morning a lot. The color of the sky, the look on your face... You were in Africa for months, but... That was the only moment you were really happy. How did you know that? Because I get you, Val. I get everything about you. I know that you tilt your head just before you get angry. I know that you rub your hands together to keep yourself from crying. And I know your face gets red when you start to feel things that you don't want to feel. Like now. None of this matters. I'm with Ethan. I know. Just take this photo as a... reminder of what we had. And just know, if you ever need me... I will come running. Javier? It's me. When are you off work? I'm in the neighborhood and thought I'd pick you up and drive you home. 5:00? That soon? No, that's good. That's good. I gotta go. [Up-tempo Latin music plays] [Coughs] I'm not sure why you insisted on picking me up. I just couldn't wait to see your lovely face. Aw, that's nice. What's wrong? S-something is different. It's... I believe the word you're searching for is "clean." It looks like she waxed your floors and organized your shelves. And what is that wonderful scent? Scent? [Inhales deeply] Ahh. She used lavender. As a professional maid, I would give concepcion an a-plus. This is probably the cleanest your house has ever been. You're right. She is so fired. What?! I've been paying that woman good money for years, and now I find out she's been phoning it in?! Take a deep breath. Smell the lavender. I am so angry! To find out she can clean like this?! In her defense, she can't. What? I cleaned the house. I met her through a friend, and she was so sweet, and her grandmother's going to kick the bucket in like five minutes, and I felt so guilty, and... Have you ever cooked with a prickly pear? A what? We use it at my restaurant all the time. On the outside it's rough and thorny, but on the inside... it's tender... and unbelievably sweet. Oh, are you trying to say that I'm a prickly pear? You like to come off tough and unforgiving, but you have a compassionate, caring heart. And that extraordinary combination... turns me on. I also cleaned the bedroom. You want to go mess it up? [Both chuckle] Oh! [Laughs] What?! Wait, Peri that claiming that I'm unfit? Listen, Jeff. I don't care if we have to file an appeal or countersue, just get my kid back, okay?! [Cellphone beeps] Oh! Hey, I'm sorry. Hey! Spence, right? It's me Reggie. Yeah, yeah. Uh, Rosie's lawyer. And her boyfriend. S-she didn't mention that? I ought you guys talked. No, not about that. Everything all right, man? You look a little pale. Yeah, I'm just having... a tough day. Yeah, I get it. You must miss Rosie something fierce, huh? As a matter of fact, I do. I don't blame you. [Chuckles] That girl's got some serious skills. Skills? You know what I'm talking about. Get her in the sack, and, like, she turns freaky. Could you not talk about Rosie like that? No, no, no. It's cool, man. You know? This is something we get to bond over. You and me... we both got to tap that. [Grunts] Get off of me! Get off of me! Get off of me! Get off of me! You stay away from her! Man : You okay? That depends. Did you get all that? Every frame. Then I'm great. What's this? A severance check. I need to let you go. You can't. We have a deal. I'm changing the terms. You're no longer welcome in this house. I earned the right to be here. The last 15 years were a gift. It's time for both of us to move on. [Gasps] Marisol's behind this, isn't she? She's threatening to leave. I can't let that happen. I love her. Enough to go to jail? If I go to jail, I am taking you with me. Now, that is more than generous. And Ethan's still in my will. He won't get that money until you're dead. If you don't do what I say, I will see to it he gets nothing at all. [Knock on door] Hey, Ty. Do you have a minute? For you? Always. I'm good. Look, I've been thinking about what happened yesterday. Me, too. Yeah. There's something we need to talk about. I know. You're worried about the massive age difference. It's not that massive! And, no, that's not it. The thing is... I already have a boyfriend. Oh. Who is it? He doesn't like me to talk about him. Why? He's a celebrity. Oh. Is it serious? Very. Oh, Honey. I like you. I do. And if this guy was out of the picture, who knows? So there's hope? No. No. There's no hope. Just a few tears, and then moving on. That's all we got. Okay? Carmen? Mm-hmm. This guy is really lucky to have you. [Sighs] Valentina, we're back! Valentina, please come. I require alcohol. Maybe she's at the store. Have you noticed a change in her behavior lately? What kind of a change? After our last conversation, she gave me this look of disdain. Are you sure? I know that look. It's the same one I give people who fly coach. Do you think there's a chance she knows about us? No. We've been ridiculously discreet. That's true. But... Come on. Valentina's obviously not home, so how about I get you drunk and touch you inappropriately? Oh, please do. [Moans passionately] [Chuckles] So, lead the way. Well, as you know, that is what I prefer. Hello, there. Guess what... Mr. Powell came home. Yes, I can see that. Darling, why didn't you call and... And warn us you were coming? Where's the fun in that? Come give us a kiss. Oh! [Chuckles] Evelyn, I've been gone for weeks. Let's try that again. [Gasps] Are you back home for the weekend? No. I'm cured. And back for good. Don't you have weeks of treatment left? The doctors at Sage Creek work quickly. With their help, I no longer worry about mysterious bogeymen outside my home, trying to take what is mine. Now, if you'll excuse me, I should go shower and change. We're all so glad you're back, Mr. Powell. And I'm glad I'm healthy. Paranoia is a crippling disease. To live on pins and needles each day, thinking your every move is being watched by someone... I wouldn't wish that on my worst enemy. What happened? [Sighs] I got in a fight. Santo dios. Let me get you some ice. How did this happen? [Sighs] I wasn't going to tell you, but you're probably going to see it on the Internet anyway. Aah! See it? What do you mean? [Grunting] Get off of me! I don't understand. We bumped into each other, said "Hello", then he started to say a lot of... personal things about you. And I-I said to him, "Stop talking about her like that", and he went crazy. I've never seen him like this. At first, I thought running into each other was a coincidence. But now I'm starting to think he was following me. Why would he follow you? Obviously he knows we're together. And clearly he's not happy about it. You know, if I hadn't seen this, I would never believe Spence could act this way. That's the beauty of pictures. You stay away from her! You hear me? Stay away! They don't lie. [Cellphone rings] [Cellphone beeps] Oh, hey. Sorry I haven't called you back. Work was crazy today. Um, yeah. Saturday should work. Uh-huh. I miss you, too. Hey. Good news. I talked to Ty. I think it went really well. What's wrong? Oh, I just got off the phone with Rosie. She's... she's furious with me. Why? I got in a fight with that guy she's dating. It wasn't my fault, I swear. Well, did you tell her that? I tried. But she wouldn't listen. She... She said she didn't want to see me again, and she hung up. Oh, Spence. [Sighs] Let me fix you a scotch. Better make it a double. [Laughs] Dahlia : Why doesn't anyone understand what this has done to me? It's been hard for all of us, Dahlia. Listen... Don't touch me! He's only trying to help, Dahlia. The only way that you can help is to let me end this. I can't let you do that, Dahlia! Do you hear me! Get off me! You can't do this! Stop! You're hurting her! Fine! Fine! She's your girlfriend. You talk to her. You're upset. Let's go home and talk about this, huh? No. I've made up my mind. Please, Dahlia. Do it for me. For you? Out of respect for everything that we've meant to each other. You mean nothing to me. Dahlia. You were an experiment something I did to relieve the boredom of being married to him. You don't mean that. I do. Now that I think about it... you sort of disgust me. [Screams] Oh, my God. [Engine revving] [Tires screech]
