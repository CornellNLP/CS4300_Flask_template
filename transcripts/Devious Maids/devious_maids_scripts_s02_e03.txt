 Previously on "Devious Maids"... 
 This is not your house! 
 I am seriously thinking about asking Nick to fire her. 
 I will personally see to it that my label honors our deal. 
 You are the best husband I never married. 
 [Guests screaming] 
 I'm not screwing around, people! 
 [Grunts] 
 Oh, my God. 
 You shot him! 
 [Voice breaking] 
 Somebody call 911! 
 So, your husband doesn't talk? 
 Not since the stroke, and... I'm his daughter. 
 I'm his wife. 
 Oh. 
 I know how it looks. 
 But every once in a while, I need to have a good time. 
 I gave up my whole life for him. 
 You are such a liar. 
 I think that means I work for him. 
 Can I talk to you about something? 
 Are you going to ask me out? 
 You're unhappy? 
 Since as long as I can remember. 
 So, you're leaving me? 
 I'm taking a break. 
 Aah! 
 Adrian is convinced the gunmen will come back. 
 This robbery has revealed a new side to Adrian, and it frightens me, because there's one thing that I cannot tolerate... 
 And that is weakness. 
 Somebody gave this to me. 
 Now you're going to give it to me. 
 How can I ever repay you? 
 Seeing you smile is payment enough. 
 Beverly Hills is under attack. 
 Twice in the last month, residents of our street have been brutalized by home invaders. 
 One of our neighbors, Alejandro Rubio, is dead. 
 The time has come for us to meet this threat head-on. 
 What exactly are you suggesting? 
 A neighborhood watch. 
 Ah. 
 I gonna need another scotch. 
 The idea is to augment our own security with nightly patrols. 
 And who would do these patrols? 
 We would. 
 "We," as in... 
 Our servants? 
 No, the residents of canon drive. 
 We'd all take shifts walking our street at night, then call the police if we see anyone suspicious. 
 Well, everyone looks suspicious to me. 
 But that's because I'm a little racist. 
 Wait... 
 Can't we pay a company to do this type of thing for us? 
 Armor alert had a car three blocks away the night our home was broken into. 
 It was useless! 
 We need another layer of security. 
 Well, maybe we could host a benefit luncheon to combat gun violence. 
 Wouldn't that be better? 
 How would that be better? 
 Everything's better with a luncheon. 
 [Inhales deeply] 
 What is wrong with you people?! 
 If you think they won't come after you, you are kidding yourself. 
 You're not safe. 
 You're not special. 
 They will come into your home and attack you and beat you. 
 And you will deserve it because you're too cowardly to stop them. 
 Thank you so much for coming, Tanya. 
 So, I'll see you at the club then? 
 Absolutely. Tony, you'll see her to the door? 
 It would be his pleasure. 
 I realize you're still traumatized by the break-in, but my patience has officially expired. [Door opens] 
 [Door closes] 
 You are going to get help. 
 I don't care if it's thai massage or talk therapy or massive amounts of psychotropic drugs. 
 I will no longer be subjected to these paranoid rantings. 
 Do you understand me? 
 The house is all locked up, Mrs. Powell. 
 Anything else? 
 I want you to help my husband move his things to the guest room. 
 Until his psychosis has subsided, he is not welcome in my bed. 
 [Sighs] 
 You okay, Mr. Powell? 
 [Sighs] I will be. 
 I just need to take back control of my life. 
 Anything I can help you with? 
 Oh, yeah. 
 You're gonna get me a gun. 
 "I don't care what you have to do, Dahlia. 
 Get Opal out of that house immediately." 
 [Gasps] What did Opal do? 
 I don't know. 
 That's why I'm freaking out. 
 Where's the rest of the letter? 
 Those pages are missing. 
 [Sighs] 
 Did you talk to Nicholas? 
 No. He'll tell me it's nothing, and I don't think it is. 
 Dahlia's mother wrote the letter. 
 Can't you talk to her? 
 Not without a ouija board. 
 She died last year. 
 I don't know what I'm gonna do. 
 Can I make a suggestion? 
 Yeah. 
 "Get Opal out of that house immediately." 
 I can't fire her for something that happened 15 years ago. 
 Unless it was really awful. 
 I wish I knew what her mother was referring to. 
 Well, then... find someone she was close to, someone she confided in. 
 Oh, yes. 
 Rich women always complain about their maids to their friends. 
 You think? 
 They complain about us. 
 We complain about them. 
 It's the circle of life. 
 All right. 
 Mm-hmm. 
 I got to go. 
 Hey, how's Carmen? 
 I left her a couple messages, but... 
 She still can't talk about it. 
 Of course not. To see Alejandro killed like that. 
 And now his family has arrived for the funeral. 
 How's that going? 
 [Sobbing] 
 Renata wanted me to thank you both for taking such good care of her nephew. 
 Alejandro was a... 
 Wonderful man. 
 He meant the world to us. 
 [Sobbing continues] 
 Yeah, she's having a rough time. 
 He was all the family that she had left. 
 We're sorry for your loss! 
 Let us know if you need more Tequila. 
 So, y-you're Mrs. Rubio's lawyer? 
 Yeah, I came out from Miami to help her settle the estate. 
 Renata's had some pretty tough decisions to make. 
 Like what? 
 Alejandro, he left most of his money to charity. 
 His aunt only got the house, and she can't afford to maintain it, so it's gonna be sold. 
 Well... uh, can we at least stay here while you try to sell it? 
 Well, actually, we have a buyer, and he's paying cash. 
 But he's gonna need you out by Friday. 
 Friday? 
 Mm. 
 That's four days from now. 
 [Sobbing] Please. 
 This is a difficult situation for everyone. 
 Oh, mostly for the people getting kicked to the curb. 
 I'm sorry, but there's nothing that I can do. 
 [Sighs] 
 As far as I can tell, he's exactly the same. 
 Are you sure? 
 Last week, at dinner, he slammed his fist on the table. 
 [Chuckles] And you are? 
 Rosie. 
 She's the maid. 
 Well, there could be other explanations. 
 Perhaps it was just a muscle spasm. 
 Mnh-mnh. 
 He's still in there. 
 I can tell. 
 Maybe he would get better with therapy. 
 Well, I've checked all his markers, and there's no indication of improvement. 
 Unless you'd like a second opinion. 
 [Chuckles] Don't be silly. 
 We trust you. 
 Okay. 
 Thanks again for stopping by. 
 You're welcome. 
 [Door opens, closes] 
 He's a doctor who makes house calls. 
 You're supposed to kiss his ass, not insult him! 
 Some doctor. 
 He was barely here 10 minutes. 
 He took his pulse. 
 He went like this. 
 I could do that. 
 Really? 
 You got a medical degree I don't know about? 
 My abuelita had a stroke. 
 My doctor made her get therapy. 
 She learned how to walk again and talk. 
 Don't you want Mr. Kenneth to get better? 
 I think Dr. Sanders is doing a fine job. 
 Maybe you should think about doing yours. 
 Ew. 
 Can I help you? 
 I...Heard about... 
 Mr. Rubio being killed. 
 I just wanted to... 
 I don't know what I wanted. 
 Were you a fan? 
 I guess. 
 I'm so sorry that this happened. 
 Don't worry. 
 The men who did this, they will be caught... 
 And punished. 
 Hey, there. 
 Hey. 
 I was just doing some homework. 
 But if you need the room, I can... 
 No, not at all. Actually, I wanted task you something. 
 Are there any pictures of Dahlia around? 
 I've heard so much about her, and I have no idea what she looks like. 
 So, does Nicholas have a photo album? 
 Sure. You want to check them out? 
 Yeah. 
 That's her. 
 Dahlia was beautiful. 
 Yeah. 
 That was some, uh, party that Nick threw for her. 
 I was really little at the time, but I remember watching everyone in their fancy clothes and... 
 [Chuckles] So, these are all Dahlia's friends? 
 Yeah. 
 She had a lot of them. 
 Wait, that woman. 
 Yeah, I clean her pool. 
 She was, like, Dahlia's best friend. 
 Why? You know her? 
 I absolutely do. 
 [Vacuum whirring] 
 [Whirring stops] 
 Goodness. 
 So much noise from such a little machine. 
 Well, sorry, but I have to get this done before your luncheon tomorrow. 
 I know. It's... 
 [Whirring resumes] 
 [Whirring stops] 
 I had my fillers injected today. 
 If I don't sleep, the botulism won't settle. 
 Well, I need 10 more minutes. 
 Then, I can scrub the floors... quietly. 
 But it's 11:00. 
 Don't you want to go home? 
 Not really. 
 I guess your house is feeling a little empty these days. 
 I don't want to talk about it. 
 You know what? 
 You need to have some fun. 
 Why not come to the luncheon? 
 I guess it would be nice to see how the other half lives. 
 Good. 
 I'm so happy. 
 You don't look happy. 
 That means the poison kicked in. 
 [Sighs] Wonderful. 
 Sí. 
 I'm off to my appointment. 
 When will you be back? 
 Couple hours. Why? 
 No reason. 
 [Speaks spanish] 
 Mr. Kenneth. 
 We got our own appointment. 
 Now, don't be scared. 
 We're just going to a wonderful clinic. 
 A friend of mine who works there is going to tell me how to make you better. 
 [Strained] Just... 
 Promise me not to tell Mrs. Didi. 
 [Sighs] 
 Good enough. 
 [Ringing] 
 [Chuckles] 
 Valentina : Hey, Remi. 
 Did I wake you? 
 [Chuckles] 
 It's 2:00 in the morning. 
 Sorry... 
 I needed to talk to someone, and... I didn't know who else to call. 
 My parents broke up. 
 [Yawns] That's sad. 
 Could you please not yawn while I'm telling you this? 
 Look, I-I just got done working a 20-hour shift. 
 I really need to get some sleep. 
 Fine. 
 I mean, you'll call me back, right? 
 Maybe. I don't know. 
 Go back to bed. 
 [Cellphone beeps] 
 What a jerk. 
 Were you eavesdropping? 
 You're sort of... 
 In my office. 
 Fine. 
 Look, if you need someone to talk to, maybe we could go out to dinner some night. 
 I promise I'd be wide awake the whole time. 
 I can't go on a date. 
 I'm not over my relationship. 
 Really? 
 Because sleeping beauty sure seems like he's over you. 
 His name is Remi, and he's working his ass off to save people's lives. 
 Don't make fun of him! 
 Adrian. 
 [Chuckling] You'll never guess who I just ran into... 
 Cynthia Florek. 
 I told her about what you've been going through, and she suggested you try this organic herbal tea. 
 [Gasps] 
 What in God's name is that? 
 It's a Ruger SR1911 Commander. 
 Isn't it beautiful? 
 [Breathing heavily] 
 You bought him a gun? 
 [Sighs] 
 Mr. Powell just wants to feel safe. 
 Oh, so do I, but I can't because the moron I'm married to is now armed and dangerous. 
 Relax. 
 I'm keeping an eye on him. 
 No, you should have come to me and asked for my permission. 
 But instead, you gave a deadly weapon to a man... 
 Now what are you doing? 
 I'm sweaty. 
 I need to dry off. 
 [Sighs] You were saying? 
 No, ah... [sighs] 
 I was saying you gave a deadly weapon to someone whose mental state... 
 [Breathes deeply] 
 Don't you know it's... offensive to disrobe in front of a lady? 
 I do. 
 But most ladies avert their eyes. 
 Stop changing the subject. 
 The topic at hand is your utter lack of judgment. 
 [Sighs] 
 Look... guns can be useful tools if you know how to use them. 
 I've got one in this room. 
 Would you like me to teach you how to handle it? 
 I will never handle any gun. 
 Especially yours. 
 How can they just kick us out? 
 Where are we supposed to go? 
 This is Odessa Burakov. 
 I'm calling to invite Mr. West to Alejandro Rubio's funeral. 
 'Cause I am broke. 
 I can't afford an apartment. 
 Well, don't you have a friend who can loan you money? 
 I don't know. 
 Do I? 
 It's Thursday at 2:00. 
 St. Peter's church in Beverly Hills. 
 See you then. 
 [Telephone beeps] 
 It's not fair. 
 Alejandro was gonna get my career started. 
 He made promises to me. 
 Yes, it was very rude of him to die. 
 I don't mean it like that, Odessa. 
 I loved Alejandro. 
 But I want to be famous. 
 And that's gonna be harder to do once I'm living under a freeway. 
 I know you're worried, but Renata needs help planning the funeral. 
 It can't be all about you right now. 
 Can it be all about me tomorrow? 
 Yes. Life will return to normal. 
 Now help me invite people to the service. I know. 
 The ones with checks by their names are already coming. 
 Kanye? 
 Justin Timberlake? 
 Beyoncé is coming? 
 Oh, yes. 
 The entire recording industry will be there... 
 Singers, songwriters, producers. 
 Oh. 
 This is good. 
 Yeah, this is very good. 
 Buenos días, tia Renata. 
 [Sighs] How is the funeral coming along? 
 Oh. 
 There's so much to do. 
 I'll bet, yeah. 
 Oh. 
 Hey. 
 Have you thought about some music? 
 Music? 
 Yeah, sure. 
 I mean, what's a funeral without some singing. 
 
 
 
 Genevieve! 
 Tanya! 
 Hi, darling. 
 Mwah. Mwah. 
 Oh, your skin is radiant. 
 Oh. Who's doing your injections? 
 No one. 
 This is all natural. 
 [Both laugh] 
 Oh, that never gets old. 
 And neither do we. 
 [Laughs] 
 Tanya, you know Zoila. 
 Uh, no, I don't believe we've met. 
 I'm her maid. 
 We've met 10 times. 
 Oh. My fault. 
 I never really look at the people who bring me drinks. 
 So... 
 [Chuckles] 
 Oh. 
 Our featured speaker just arrived. 
 He's going to be lecturing today on the cause of gun violence. 
 You leave me alone with this woman, and you'll be the cause of gun violence. 
 I'll be right back. 
 You know, it's a bit warm. 
 I should, uh... 
 I should get rid of this. 
 Genevieve invited me to this luncheon as her guest. 
 And there's a closet around the corner. 
 [Inhales sharply] 
 Look, I-I don't need all the details. 
 Just, um... make it go away. 
 [Chuckles] Okay? 
 You got it. 
 Hey, Zoila. 
 Oh. 
 Mm. 
 Thank you so much for getting me an invitation to this party. 
 They're all bitches. 
 Good luck to you. 
 Evelyn. 
 Oh. 
 Well, if it isn't the ghost of housecleaning past. 
 Nice to see you, too. 
 Why are you still working as a maid? 
 Don't tell me another family member's been falsely imprisoned. 
 I'm running in your circles these days. 
 I'm engaged to Nicholas Deering. 
 [Gulps] 
 Oh. 
 I hope this isn't awkward for you. 
 Adrian and I hired you to scrub our toilets, and now you're with a man worth twice what we are. 
 Why would that be awkward? 
 The other doctor says he can't get better, but I think he can. 
 Oh, I agree. 
 And I can't imagine why his family physician hasn't insisted on physical therapy. 
 That's what I said. 
 Right? 
 Didn't I say that? 
 Now, obviously, we'll have to work on his mobility... 
 Three times a week to begin with. 
 Uh, my office can refer a rehab facility. 
 Thank you so much, Dr. Joe. 
 I also want you to get a rubber ball. 
 Mm-hmm. Have him practice squeezing. 
 Once he has mobility in his hand, get a keyboard in front of him. 
 See if he can type. 
 The sooner he can communicate with us, the better. 
 I will. 
 This is so exciting, Mr. Kenneth. 
 [Singsong voice] 
 You're gonna get better. 
 [Normal voice] Thank you. 
 You doing okay back there? 
 We'll get you home soon. 
 [Gasps] 
 [Indistinct conversations] 
 Could I have my coat now? 
 Oh, right. 
 You have to apologize first. 
 Excuse me? 
 See, the way you demanded I just take your coat was, you know... rude. 
 Well, I don't think that I was rude. 
 Then you were raised by apes. 
 Give me my coat. 
 Hmm. 
 Genevieve, your maid refuses to give me my coat. 
 I told her I was here as your guest, and she just shoved that ratty old fur into my hands like I was her slave. 
 To hell with her. 
 Okay, okay. 
 What about this? 
 I'll get the coat. 
 Thank you. 
 I didn't put it in the closet. 
 Oh. Where is it? 
 Not until I get an apology. 
 Okay, this is ridiculous. 
 Make her give me my coat. 
 Can't you just apologize? 
 Oh, for God's sake. 
 She is your maid. 
 Doesn't she have to do what you say? 
 You'd think so, wouldn't you? 
 Evelyn. 
 May I talk to you for a moment? 
 Why not? 
 I've just finished my third wine spritzer. 
 I'm ready to pretend we're equals now. 
 [Pats chair] 
 [Sighs] 
 So, I understand that you were very close with Nicholas' first wife. 
 I loved Dahlia like a sister. 
 And I'm guessing she confided in you. 
 All the time. 
 But I can't betray secrets. 
 Can you gossip? 
 That, I can do. 
 Did Dahlia ever... 
 Talk about her maid? 
 Opal? 
 Not really. 
 She complained about her housekeeping. 
 Opal was less than immaculate. 
 [Chuckles] 
 Not like you. You can vacuum with the best of them. 
 Thank you. 
 So, Dahlia never talked about wanting to get rid of Opal? 
 No. 
 Although... 
 [Clears throat] 
 Since she died, there have been rumors. 
 Rumors? 
 This is the very worst kind of gossip. 
 People can be so cruel. 
 But it does make sense when you think about it. 
 What are you talking about? 
 He's been alone in that house for 15 years, never dating, never socializing. 
 And men have needs. 
 And she was right there. 
 Wait. Wait. 
 Are you suggesting that Nick and Opal had an affair? 
 [Gasps] Oh, dear. 
 I hope this isn't awkward for you. 
 Very good, Mr. Kenneth. 
 Soon, you will be able to type on your computer, and we'll be able to have nice, long talks. 
 [Door closes] [Gasps] 
 I'll be right back, Mr. Kenneth. 
 You're back already? 
 Uh, yeah. 
 Did you start dinner? 
 I didn't have time. 
 While you were out, I took Mr. Kenneth to a new doctor. 
 What? 
 He says therapy will really help Mr. Kenneth. 
 He wants him to start going three times a week. 
 I don't care what some quack friend of yours wants. 
 You don't take my husband out of this house without my permission. 
 And then, coming back, this funny thing happened. 
 Are you listening to me? 
 You're fired. 
 I want you gone in an hour. 
 I saw you kissing Dr. Sanders in the street. 
 I was just... thanking him for his help with Kenny. 
 From what I saw, you were very, very thankful. 
 [Sighs] 
 Are you gonna tell Lucinda? 
 Not if you let Mr. Kenneth get the help he needs. 
 Fine. 
 But it won't do any good. 
 Bill says he's a lost cause. 
 My doctor promised me therapy will make a difference. 
 Why would bill lie? 
 Maybe he thinks you're more fun without a husband. 
 If there is a chance that Kenny can go back to being Kenny, of course I'd love to meet this new doctor. 
 Good. 
 Just try not to kiss this one. 
 [Keyboard clacking] 
 [Ringing] 
 Hello. 
 Um, hi. 
 I was looking for Remi. 
 Who are you? 
 I'm Heather. 
 I work with Remi. 
 And you are? 
 Nobody. 
 Don't move! 
 [Screams] 
 Oh. It's just you. 
 Mr. Powell. 
 Why do you have a gun? 
 The men who invaded our home are going to come back. 
 I've got to be ready for them when they do. 
 Um... Mr. Powell. 
 You don't look so good. 
 I know. 
 I haven't slept in days. 
 I was about to get myself some tea. 
 I could fix you some, too. 
 Yeah. 
 That would be nice. 
 Mmm. That really hits the spot. 
 Thank you so much... 
 Valentina. 
 Mr. Powell, can I say something? 
 And I don't mean to offend you. 
 Go right ahead. 
 I'm worried about you. 
 Wandering around the house with a gun... 
 It's not good for you. 
 Did you know that Evelyn and I had a son? 
 No. 
 He died when he was six. 
 Oh, my God. 
 I gave him a bike for his birthday. 
 Evelyn took him out riding. 
 She turned her back for just a second. 
 He rode into the street, and this car came. 
 Whoever was driving didn't even stop. 
 They just kept going. 
 I'm so sorry. 
 I should have been there to protect him. 
 I wasn't. 
 And now... he's gone. 
 Evelyn is all I have left. 
 And no one... is going to take her from me. 
 [Cellphone ringing] 
 [Cellphone beeps] 
 Hello? 
 Are you trying to get us arrested? 
 Get out of there now. 
 I'm not talking to anyone. 
 We don't care. 
 Just leave. 
 Okay. 
 And, Ty... 
 Don't pull this again. 
 [Engine turns over] 
 Hi. 
 Still looking through that album? 
 Yeah. I found a crazy photo of me when I was five. 
 [Chuckles] If you think that I am handsome now. 
 I bet you were adorable. 
 Mm. 
 Where's your mom? 
 I need to talk to her. 
 Uh, she's at the store. 
 Nicholas gets home tomorrow, so she's gonna bake him a cake. 
 Oh. 
 That's nice of her. 
 She's always doing stuff like that for him. 
 So, who does nice things for your mom? 
 What do you mean? 
 Well, is there someone special in her life? 
 You mean does she date? 
 Oh, please, don't go there. 
 [Laughing] What? 
 She's a woman. 
 Most women crave companionship. 
 No, not my mom. 
 [Laughs] 
 She wasn't always single. 
 What about your dad? 
 What about him? 
 Did I say something wrong? 
 I'm sorry, no. 
 It's just, uh, I don't know who my father is. 
 What? 
 Yeah, for years, I begged my mom to tell me, but she said it was better for everyone if I didn't know, so I stopped asking. 
 Oh, my God. 
 I know. 
 It sucks. 
 A-and I don't care if he was a jerk or if it was a one-night stand. 
 I just want to know who my dad was, you know? 
 What's the big mystery?

 [stammers] 
 What are you doing? 
 I-I was just... 
 No, you're stepping forward. 
 I'm the lead singer. 
 You're backup so back up. 
 And while we're stopped, um, can we talk about tempo? 
 Hector, if you don't pick up the pace,  I'll be singing at your funeral next week. 
 Take five, everybody. 
 When I'm back, be better. 
 Hey. 
 What are you doing here? 
 Renata told me you offered to sing at the memorial. 
 I thought it would be nice to have a little musical tribute. 
 Doesn't seem like much of a tribute. 
 Seems like an audition. 
 Alejandro believed in me, Odessa. 
 He would have wanted me to have this chance. 
 This funeral is for people who loved him, who want to say goodbye with a little dignity. 
 For God's sake! 
 I'm gonna be dignified. 
 I finished putting the sequins on your dress. 
 Not now, Jimmy! 
 Listen, I got to finish rehearsing. 
 He died in your arms, Carmen! 
 How can you think about anything but saying goodbye to that dear, sweet man? 
 I loved Alejandro. 
 But he's dead. 
 I'm not. 
 And I'm gonna be a star. 
 Are you ready? 
 Come on. 
 [Sighs] 
 [Door opens] 
 Knock, knock. 
 Genevieve isn't here right now. 
 Well, actually, I'm here to see you. 
 I wanted to tell you how sorry I am for my behavior at the luncheon. 
 Wow, that coat must have cost you a bundle. 
 No, no. 
 This is a sincere apology. 
 I was incredibly insensitive, and I truly hope that you can find it in your heart to forgive me. 
 Um... 
 [Inhales deeply] Okay. 
 You are forgiven. 
 Wonderful. 
 I want us to be friends. 
 Maybe we can see a movie sometime. 
 [Exhales sharply] 
 Before we pencil anything in, let me get your coat. 
 I really do appreciate your apology. 
 The truth is I was also a little bit out of line. 
 Well, at least you have an excuse for your behavior. 
 I don't. 
 Huh? 
 Well, Genevieve explained your terrible situation to me. 
 And I went through the same thing last year. 
 So humiliating. 
 What exactly did she tell you? 
 Well, that your husband dumped you. 
 And after 20 years of marriage, I mean, it's no wonder you've been so cranky and irritable. 
 Well... thanks. 
 [Door opens, closes] 
 Hey. 
 I'm not doing anything this weekend, and I thought maybe if you weren't doing anything... 
 Maybe... we could not do anything together? 
 What about your, uh... 
 Your friend from the Congo? 
 He's in the Congo. 
 And I think he's made a new friend, so... maybe I should, too. 
 How's he doing? 
 Heather : Not well. 
 His fever's up. 
 You tried the antibiotics? 
 He's not responding to them. 
 And I'm starting to get worried. 
 Finally. 
 [Scoffs] Zoila. 
 It's after 10:00. 
 I thought you'd gone home. 
 What's wrong? 
 I haven't even told my friends about Pablo. 
 Now I find out you've been gossiping about my personal life. 
 Do you know how that makes me feel? 
 Humiliated? 
 Exactly. 
 What are you doing? 
 [Sighs] I'm sitting. 
 [Scoffs] 
 Go on. 
 You told Tanya so she would apologize. 
 You'd rather betray my confidence than be embarrassed about some stupid coat. 
 Well? 
 Aren't you gonna defend yourself? 
 I was wrong. 
 What's with all the serenity? 
 See, I don't mind if you yell because I know you're not really angry with me. 
 Oh, yes, I am. 
 No. 
 And you're not angry about Tanya's coat, either. 
 This is about your husband. 
 So, you can yell and throw things and tell me to go to hell because I'm not Pablo or Valentina. 
 I will never leave you. 
 See? 
 This is why it's important that we talk these things out. 
 Because if we don't, we cry and ruin our makeup. [Sniffles] 
 I should probably go. 
 To that empty house? 
 No. 
 You're gonna stay here for awhile. 
 I couldn't impose. 
 Don't be silly. 
 It'll be fun. 
 We'll stay up late and eat carbs. 
 [Chuckles] 
 What do you say? 
 [Sniffles] 
 I say... 
 You're an amazing woman. 
 It's so true. 
 [Moaning] 
 [Breathing heavily] 
 Tony? 
 It's Mrs. Powell... 
 Evelyn. 
 I wanted to talk to you. 
 [Doorknob rattling] 
 For God's sake. 
 [Chuckles] 
 [Gunshot] 
 [Gasps] [Thud] 
 Evelyn! 
 You idiot. 
 Shouldn't we take her to the hospital? 
 You just grazed her. 
 And besides, they have to report gunshot wounds. 
 You could be arrested. 
 But Evelyn wouldn't press charges. 
 Would you, sweetheart? 
 [Sighs] 
 There's a doctor I know... 
 Very discreet. 
 Phone him and say Tony Bishara is calling in a favor. 
 Obviously, you're furious at me. 
 I'm hoping, in time... 
 Perhaps with some counseling, you could find it in your heart... 
 Could we discuss this once I've stopped bleeding? 
 Sure. 
 [Sighs] 
 What is it? 
 I saw you tonight. 
 With Tanya. 
 Oh. 
 Now, I could care less who you sleep with. 
 It makes no difference to me. 
 But just know Tanya's breasts are fake and she's had chlamydia twice. 
 Mrs. Taseltov means nothing to me. 
 Then why be with her? 
 Because... I can't have who I really want. 
 Why not? 
 Well, this woman I'm interested in... is married, and I think if I ever told her how I really felt... 
 She'd be angry with me. 
 Maybe... this... woman... 
 Isn't happy. 
 Maybe her husband is falling apart and she is desperately in need of a strong man like you. 
 So... you think I should tell her how I feel? 
 As soon as possible. 
 And even though Alejandro was very famous, he never forgot where he came from. 
 When I turned 50, I had a big party, and he flew in all the way from Los Angeles just to see me. 
 Anyway... 
 [Voice breaking] 
 ...I will miss him very much. 
 [Sniffles] 
 And now Carmen Luna would like to honor Alejandro with a musical tribute. 
 [Breathes shakily] 
 Hello. I'm Carmen. 
 Alejandro was my mentor. 
 He taught me to believe in myself and to... 
 To pursue my dreams. 
 Alejandro, this is for you. 
 [Piano music plays] 
 [Music stops] 
 [Music resumes] 
 I'm sorry. 
 [Music stops] 
 Start again. 
 [Music resumes] 
 I r... 
 [Music stops] 
 I'm sorry. 
 [Sniffles] 
 [Voice breaking] 
 He was so good to me. 
 [Sniffles] 
 I didn't realize I was gonna miss him so much. 
 [Crying] 
 That was the tribute he deserved.
