 When was this decision reached? 
 Mr Jaggers, we simply have two additional attendees at our meeting. 
 A meeting of the utmost importance. 
 All the shareholders in one room, we can't afford to take risks. 
 Your brother's recent behaviour, for example. 
 He is very sorry. 
 I feel this could be a fresh start for both of us. 
 Arthur, as a shareholder himself, has every right to be there. 
 And this Mr Compeyson? 
 What's his interest? 
 He may invest. 
 Besides, Mr Compeyson has become a good friend to Arthur. 
 I thought his presence would be a calming influence. 
 It was your suggestion? 
 Of course. 
 Mr Jaggers, I don't understand your objection. 
 I'm merely questioning... 
 I'm urging you not to consign your trust too quickly. That's all. 
 I came to see you ahead of this meeting as a matter of courtesy, not to seek your counsel. 
 Comb your hair, at least. 
 Today the tide turns, Havisham. 
 I can't wait to see how the shareholders take to a woman at the helm. 
 Thank you for your company, Sir Leicester. 
 A very pleasant start to the day's work. 
 Not at all. 
 Soon, you might be free to spend your days as you wish. 
 Hello, Peter. 
 Nell! 
 Happy birthday. 
 You remembered. 
 Course. 
 Can I call on you this evening? 
 Hello, Mrs Gamp. At long last! 
 Very agreeable, dearie, I'm sure, but I have to confess that not even the promise of a servant could tempt me to the Midlands. 
 I was not of the notion that you'd ever even visited Staffordshire. 
 For the reasoning that it is rampant with cracksmen, oysters and dippers. 
 Well, rather a few petty criminals than a murderer on the loose. 
 Mr Gradgrind was practically begging, wasn't he? 
 (HE GRUMBLES) 
 Such desperation from a man of his standing. 
 We are still waiting for an official offer to be made. 
 Strictly a formality. 
 Oh, well. I must be on my way. 
 Provisions for Mr Wegg. 
 Lord alone knows what he'd do without me. 
 He's a very needy gentleman. 
 And, truth, it's a strain to parry his advances. 
 Yet, so adept at disguising his affections. 
 Documents, clothing, weapons, anything that could link Fagin to Marley. 
 I want Croucher's warehouse scoured from floor to rafters. 
 We must make ourselves indispensable. 
 Leave all the talking to me. 
 Well, how am I to become indispensable if I'm to sit the entire meeting out in complete silence? 
 At the moment, you can barely maintain personal hygiene, I doubt you've the strength of mind to win back your share of the estate. 
 Cat got your tongue, has it? 
 Hello, sir. Pleased to make your acquaintance. 
 I am Mrs Compeyson. 
 Well, congratulations. 
 You made it into the society pages. 
 A night of decadence at the Havisham ball. 
 I've been struggling to make ends meet and you've been living the high life? 
 Let's take this somewhere a little more private and I'll explain. 
 Oh, look! He's ashamed. Bless him. 
 Sally, please! 
 No, you try getting kicked out of our home by the landlord, neighbours all gawping. 
 My dear fellow, please go on to our meeting and offer my sincere apologies to Mr Havisham. 
 Think of something! 
 I'll be there as soon as I can. 
 Don't bother with excuses. 
 You tell your Mr Havisham that Meriwether Compeyson is nothing but a lying little weasel. 
 One. 
 Two. 
 Three. 
 Stop him! 
 Inspector. 
 An unexpected honour. 
 So, this is your racket, Fagin? 
 Oh, a little uncouth, Inspector. 
 These poor wretches have been sent to us with the blessings of their family or workhouse to be put to good use in mines overseas. 
 I see it more as a charity than a business. 
 Fine charity that sees children shivering in a filthy warehouse. 
 Better than shivering in the gutter, I'm sure you'll agree. 
 I'm not an ogre, Inspector. 
 Allow me to be the judge of that. 
 A man of your good sense must surely know you have no cause to arrest me. 
 Don't worry. 
 You're not in trouble. 
 You've been here long? 
 Days? Weeks? 
 Weeks. 
 How would you like it if I took you for a nice currant bun? 
 A friend? 
 His oldest and dearest. 
 Completely without warning. 
 How awful. 
 He's gone to pay his respects to the family but hopes to join us shortly. 
 Oh, no, there are far more important things than this meeting. 
 Are you still attending? 
 Arthur, please don't burden yourself with obligation. 
 I won't embarrass you, Amelia. 
 Is there a problem? 
 Mr Compeyson is running slightly late. 
 Perhaps we could wait a few... 
 No, no. We can't delay any longer. 
 It's for one evening only. 
 Tomorrow, I will settle with the bailiffs and you'll be back at home. 
 Now, I have business to attend to. 
 No. Weeks gone by and no word? 
 Is that all I deserve? 
 We can talk on my return. 
 We talk NOW. 
 I shan't think twice about following you there, telling your business associates the truth about who they're dealing with. 
 (RATTLING) 
 Lock me in, I'll climb out the window. 
 Apologies, gentlemen, for the delay and a very warm welcome. 
 May I begin by offering my sincere thanks to all of you for helping to build the Havisham Brewery into the empire we so proudly represent today. 
 All : Hear, hear! 
 Of course, a great empire requires great leadership. 
 (GRUMBLING) 
 And I think we will agree there was none greater than my dear father. 
 All : Hear, hear! 
 But this is a new era and, today, I would like to propose some changes. 
 (GRUMBLING) 
 Do you think I enjoy being away for weeks on end? 
 Everything I do is for us, to keep a roof over our heads. 
 That's a fine job you're doing. We don't even HAVE a roof any more. 
 For heaven's sake, let me go, so I can put this right. 
 What are you up to? 
 The details are irrelevant. 
 All you need to know is we stand to make a fortune. 
 Go, then, before I change my mind. 
 (DOOR OPENS) 
 Initial outlay aside, to move the malt house onto the brewery site would remove transport costs. 
 Miss Havisham, the malt house poses a significant fire hazard. 
 I commend your prudence, but it would be of little concern if the entire brewery was razed to the ground. 
 Thank you, Mr Norton. 
 That actually brings me to the next point on my agenda. 
 I assume you're familiar with the new trend of jack arching, as used on the new Perkins brewhouse at Southwark. 
 This is the practice of using steel rather than timber beams on concrete ceilings for fireproofing and longevity. 
 Let me explain in more detail. 
 Your parents, God rest their souls, would be very proud to see what fine manners you have. 
 So, Mr Fagin, is he there much at the warehouse? 
 Not all the time. 
 Mostly he leaves the bigger boys to watch us. 
 Ever see anyone else with him? 
 A gentleman? 
 There was another gentleman once. 
 What did he look like? 
 He was a big man, straggly hair tied up in a ponytail with black ribbon. 
 How many times did you see him? 
 Only one time, sir. 
 Day after I got took to where you found me. 
 Are you sure of that? 
 Him and Mr Fagin were shouting at each other. 
 
 
 
 (GRUMBLING) 
 A show of hands, then, gentlemen? 
 Any questions or concerns, please don't hesitate to raise them. 
 Then I think we should bring this meeting to a close. 
 (APPLAUSE) 
 Well done. 
 Miss Havisham, please forgive me. 
 Your poor friend. What a dreadful shock. 
 Yes. Yes, it was a... 
 Very unexpected. 
 Impressive, Miss Havisham. 
 Yes, you were, Amelia. 
 Now, Mr Norton is keen to speak with you. 
 Mr Compeyson, I apologise. Excuse me. 
 What happened to delaying it? 
 As you constantly remind me, Amelia won't listen to me. 
 After her triumph today I doubt she'll seek anyone's counsel again. 
 Perhaps it's time to face facts. Your plan is failing. 
 You will have to find alternative accommodation this evening. 
 You can't keep me from my own lodgings. 
 (DOOR SHUTS) 
 "Beware the fury of a patient man." 
 You ever heard that phrase, Fagin? 
 Can't say I have, no. 
 My dear old father used to say it to me when I was a boy. 
 I would tell you some of the things my father used to say to me, Inspector, but I don't remember. He abandoned me before I could walk. 
 And here you are treating defenceless orphans like cattle. 
 Ah, yes, and here you are coming to the rescue of those poor mites. 
 That what you tell yourself when you warm your hands on coal mined by those very same children? 
 Or perhaps as you button your crisp, cotton shirt milled by tiny fingers. 
 This is an injustice. 
 You are holding an innocent man without cause. 
 How did Jacob Marley react when he discovered you were running your sordid little business from his empty warehouse? 
 I imagine he was angry. I imagine you argued. 
 I imagine things turned rather nasty. 
 You and your imagination. 
 Why do you think Mr Marley bought Croucher's warehouse in the first place? 
 The business was his idea. 
 We were partners. 
 Why have you never mentioned this till now? 
 You never asked. 
 The business is legal. 
 Murder, on the other hand, is not. 
 And what would be my motive? 
 You wanted Marley's share of the profits. 
 On the contrary, he left numerous invoices and no means of payment. 
 His death has been most inconvenient. 
 No matter how much you want it to be true, Inspector Bucket, I did not kill Jacob Marley. 
 (HE SNIFFS) 
 Did you know what Marley was using it for? 
 It's not of my concern, Inspector. 
 I oversaw the business, that's all. It can't be legal, can it? 
 Shipping starving children across the world? 
 And there's nothing I can do to stop it? 
 It is entirely within the law. 
 Perhaps that's where you and I differ. 
 I'm more concerned with justice. 
 (BACKGROUND CHATTER) 
 (BACKGROUND CHATTER) 
 (SOBBING BEHIND DOOR) 
 (SHE SOBS) 
 There was I enjoying a moment's peace. 
 What's the matter, Ma? 
 Tim needs a doctor. 
 We can't afford it. 
 Give my life for the lot of you and I can't get me hands on a few extra shillings. 
 (JANGLING) 
 Been saving. It ain't much, but it should help. 
 It's yours. You earned it. You keep it. 
 And watch my brother go sick? 
 (SHE SOBS) 
 Ain't meant to make you upset, Ma. 
 You ain't made me upset. 
 You've made me proud. 
 You're a good boy, Peter. 
 The very best. 
 (DOOR OPENS) 
 Hello, Peter. 
 They're beautiful. Thank you. 
 Buy you the crown jewels if I could. 
 What would I do with them? 
 For all intents and purposes, you are the boy's legal guardian, Inspector, so if you wouldn't mind signing. 
 You must look after this boy, Mrs Bumble. He needs feeding up. 
 He should count himself lucky he's not on the way to the mine with the rest of them. 
 And you should count yourself lucky to have him here at the workhouse. 
 He's a decent lad. 
 Treat him with care and respect. 
 He'll be in the best of hands during his time with us, Inspector. 
 My pleasure to meet you, young man. 
 Mine, too, sir. Thank you. 
 I will say this. 
 Manners are important. 
 But so is speaking up for yourself. 
 You remember that. 
 (CHATTER) 
 Mrs Gamp, my entire gin stock is gone. 
 37 bottles! This is theft! 
 Oh, my Lord! 
 Who would do such a thing? 
 Inspector, I wish to report a crime. Sorry, I'm off duty. 
 What is the world coming to? 
 From now on, I will watch that cellar door like a hawk. 
 You have until tomorrow to vacate the premises. 
 I beg your pardon. 
 I want you gone, Mrs Gamp. 
 (CHATTER) 
 Promise you'll put things right. 
 I swear it. 
 (DRIPPING WATER) 
 (BELL TOLLS) 
 (BACKGROUND CHATTER) 
 (HORSE NEIGHS) 
 I felt dreadful having to rush away earlier. 
 Not at all. 
 So nervous about the meeting. But I surprised myself. 
 Standing there addressing the room, I felt like I was born for it. 
 How insensitive of me. 
 You're grieving and here I am talking about my meeting. 
 Amelia, if you'll grant me a moment there's something I wish to say. 
 What is it? 
 Harsh as it may sound, my dear friend's demise has provided me with a vivid clarity. 
 For all I know, I may follow him tomorrow. 
 Don't say such a thing... 
 It's true. 
 Any of us might. Why deny it? 
 It's a life of... pretence. 
 And I admit I've been pretending to you since the day we met. 
 Pretending? 
 Pretending that I don't love you more than I've loved another person in my life. 
 I want to walk by your side for the rest of my days, share everything I have with you. 
 Amelia Havisham, will you do me the honour of becoming my wife? 
 (SHE GASPS) 
 If it's not your wish, I'll leave this second. 
 It has nothing to do with my wishes, but my duty... 
 Please don't talk to me about duty. Do you love me? 
 Very much. 
 Then that is all that matters. 
 Life is fleeting, Amelia. 
 If happiness is within reach, seize it with both hands. 
 Then the answer is yes. I will marry you.
