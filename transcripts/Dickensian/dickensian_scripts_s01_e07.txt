 Your sister's... "North Star" has made himself comfortable at Satis House. 
 Far too comfortable. 
 Trust me, Pocket's nothing more than a struggling tutor. 
 Father paid for him to travel so that he might make something of himself. 
 And has he? 
 No. Far too honest for his own good. 
 I wouldn't give him another thought. He'll be gone within a few days. 
 Thank you, cousin. 
 For? 
 Getting me out riding again. I haven't been since Father died. 
 I spend all my time trying to run the brewery. 
 It must be a terrible responsibility. 
 It's a privilege to be trusted with such a task. 
 Is there anything I can do to help? 
 Name it - you know I'd do anything for you. 
 Well, there is something... if you are willing to change your travel plans. 
 Thank you. 
 His bark's worse than his bite. 
 ( Shutter opens ) 
 Kiss for luck? 
 Ah, Mr Barbary. 
 The ship containing your stock has set sail. 
 Excellent! 
 Many thanks, Mr Jaggers. 
 ( Door opens ) 
 Dodger? 
 Nah. Prince Albert! 
 Closest you'll get to 'im's a royal hidin'. 
 What you got for me, boy? 
 Chop... beer. 
 Oy, that it? 
 What you want the soap for? You got lice? 
 You want to try vinegar. 
 You want to try keepin' that out of my business. 
 ( Dodger laughs ) 
 Tell Nancy to meet me in The Cripples, two bells, sharp! 
 Soap? 
 Then he wanted me to knock on Nancy's to tell her to meet him later. 
 Follow him. See what he's up to. 
 Make sure you keep out of sight. 
 Let's see your pickings, then. What you got? 
 The hat's mine! 
 Take this to Sir Leicester Dedlock - and hurry. 
 Oh! 
 Excuse me! 
 What the eye doesn't see... 
 My usual, Mr Wegg. 
 Whoa, up you go. 
 What's your name? 
 Tim, sir. 
 How do you do, Tim? 
 My name's Bucket - it's a funny name, isn't it? 
 King of the castle, eh? Oh, lovely, lovely wedding, Emily. 
 Your Martha looked a picture - worth the wait. 
 'Ow are the newlyweds? 
 Their first day of married life at the Bagnets. 
 You dropped this, sir. 
 Oh, thank you. Good lad. 
 Good lad. 
 Honest young man you've got here. 
 Takes after his father. 
 Marseille! 
 Somethin' changed about you, Bill? 
 No. 
 You've 'ad a wash. 
 Yeah, and a comb! 
 And you smell clean. Like a proper gent! 
 You coming, girl? 
 Mr Compeyson? 
 My apologies for being unable to meet with you yesterday. 
 Perhaps you'll call again? 
 Perhaps. 
 My favourites - how like you to remember, Matthew. 
 Does Mr Compeyson still show an interest in the brewery? 
 What he says and what he does are two very different things. 
 Marseille... 
 This brandy was stolen on the same night Jacob Marley was murdered. 
 Any suspects? 
 Couple of dockers but they had alibis for Christmas Eve, sir. 
 Find out if Silas Wegg has ever troubled us. 
 Small favour, Mrs Gamp. 
 If that inspector comes sniff in' around again, tell him I ain't here. 
 Where will you be? 
 Here. Only don't tell 'im that. 
 If anyone asks, we're out of brandy. 
 Silas? 
 Might a small favour go with a small reward? 
 Ta very much, kind sir. 
 What's all this in aid of? 
 There's no reason why we can't 'ave ourselves a picnic. 
 If I didn't know better, I'd say you was tryin' to impress me. 
 Don't be daft. 
 There's a sight I never thought I'd set eyes on - Bill Sikes blushing! 
 Shut up and drink your ale, gal. 
 *** 
 That's it, sir, that's the loan paid back, every last penny of it. 
 I'mHmm, well, overwhelmed. 
 It's, er, it's most generous of you to return the money that you stole from me, Cratchit. 
 I apologise, sir. 
 You think that rights your wrong, do you? 
 I didn't say that, sir. 
 Then allow me to say it for you, Cratchit - such a treacherous act will not go unpunished. 
 As to what that punishment should be... I haven't decided yet. 
 You were out early. 
 I had something of the utmost importance to attend to. 
 Voila! 
 Papa! You spoil us! 
 How can we afford such luxury? 
 They're glazed fruits, not gold sceptres. 
 I know, but... 
 The stock is on its way. Mr Jaggers has confirmed it. 
 But Papa, I... 
 But nothing, Frances. Now, you see here - and here. 
 If you turn these up, they form something called a smile. Try it. 
 Look at you. You become more like a vagrant every day. 
 Oh, dear Arthur! 
 What a joy to see you again. 
 Cousin? 
 Such sad news about your father. 
 I was so very fond of him. 
 How did you... know I was here? 
 I've come to see Mr Compeyson. 
 I hadn't realised you two were friends. 
 Our paths crossed at my club. 
 You wish to see me? 
 If you'll allow me to buy you a drink, perhaps you'll tell me what your interest in Miss Havisham's brewery is. 
 Bill Sikes ain't the sort to partake of a picnic. 
 A whatnic? 
 EPicnic. 
 What's it mean? 
 It means Sikes is up to something, my dear. 
 I have a legacy to invest, although I should add your cousin's brewery isn't my only avenue of interest. 
 If it were to become so, what returns would you expect? 
 With respect, Mr Pocket, if I wish to discuss my investments, I'd prefer do it with the person in charge. 
 You're talking to him. 
 What? 
 Your sister has persuaded me to delay my travels to America to help her with the brewery. 
 But you don't know the first thing about running a brewery. 
 I don't claim to, but Amelia has already been showing me the ropes. 
 Father's barely cold in the grave and already it seems like she's quite the expert. 
 She doesn't want to let him down, Arthur. 
 And although the business means everything to her, so do you. 
 It's true. She wants you to come home. 
 I have little reason to return, even less now. 
 Well, this is an excellent opportunity for me to ask you about the business, instead of me bothering Miss Havisham. 
 More drinks! 
 No, no, I'm fine. 
 I insist. I'm only too grateful for your advice. 
 ( Knock on door ) 
 We're expecting visitors? 
 I invited Sir Leicester for afternoon tea. 
 Sir Leicester? 
 Miss Barbary. 
 Mr Barbary. 
 Please. 
 Your sister is conspicuous by her absence. 
 She's due home from the shop any minute. 
 James! 
 Erm, I wanted to ask you something. 
 The answer's yes. 
 You don't know what I'm going to ask yet. 
 Whatever it is, yes, yes, yes. 
 There's an old saying. 
 The truer the love line, the longer the love lasts. 
 And I can see that your love for one very lucky man will last... forever. 
 What trade are you in, Barbary? 
 Textiles. 
 Textiles? 
 Oh... 
 Fascinating. 
 Where's Father, Rose? I've brought a visitor to see him. > 
 Do excuse me. 
 Captain Hawdon? 
 He's come to meet Father. 
 I'm afraid he's unwell. 
 Well, he seemed fine before. 
 I know, but trust me, now is not a good time. 
 I'm quite concerned. 
 I can see him when he's in better spirits. 
 No, but... 
 Just go to him. Until tomorrow. 
 I'll explain later, but for now... 
 Father... 
 We have a visitor. 
 
 
 
 It's an honour to meet you again, Miss Honoria. 
 Likewise, Sir Leicester. 
 If I may say, Miss Honoria, you have... a fine colour, despite toiling all day in a dress shop. 
 I do hope you find time for deserved recreation? 
 On Sundays, yes. 
 After attending church, of course. 
 My offer to you and your sister to ride at Chesney Wold still stands. 
 I'm sure we'll act on your kind offer soon, won't we, sister? 
 If we're able to. 
 Would you excuse me, Sir Leicester? 
 I must... change. 
 As I say, Pocket, I can't be certain where I'll invest next, but... one thing is certain. 
 Miss Havisham is fortunate to have a man like you to help steer the ship. 
 You've only known me for a few hours. 
 Well, in that time I can see you're a good man. 
 Honest. True. 
 More drinks! 
 We haven't finished these yet, Arthur. 
 Come on, Pocket. Drink up. 
 Don't tell me there's a lily-liver among us! 
 Three large whiskies please and er... 
 ( He whispers ) 
 ..keep the change. 
 Thanks. 
 I owe you an apology, Compeyson. 
 About what? 
 Miss Havisham. She's very dear to me. 
 And she's also an extremely wealthy young woman. 
 And there are certain men who'd take advantage of that fact. 
 You think I'm such a man? 
 I had to be certain of your motives. That's why I came to see you. 
 And do you trust me, now? 
 I'm relieved to say, yes, I do. 
 Then you're a fool, Pocket. 
 Sorry? 
 Of course I intend to seduce Miss Havisham and steal her entire fortune - every last penny of it. 
 You had me there, Compeyson! 
 Hook, line and sinker! 
 Silas Wegg was charged with assault two years ago. 
 A drunk tried to rob him as he slept. 
 He split the man's head open. 
 Didn't use a cosh, did he? 
 In a manner. His wooden leg. 
 Where do you think you're going, Cratchit? 
 What... what... what's this, my turtle dove? 
 The letter to the Board, from you. 
 Sign. 
 I appear to have invited Mr Gradgrind to dinner. 
 How clever of you, Bumble. 
 And... and it seems he's going to have a "feast fit for a king"? 
 Ingenious! 
 See, you can be intelligent when I put your mind to it. 
 Sign! 
 Mr Wegg about? 
 Oh, wait there, Inspector, there was something he told me not to tell you. 
 What was it? 
 No - sorry - I... it's... gone... 
 Off somewhere, Mr Wegg? 
 How is it that you're in possession of cognac stolen from the vessel, the St Marie, which docked here on Christmas Eve? 
 Ahh, the pain - terrimenjous, it is. 
 Ow, the agony of it! 
 Perhaps you'd be more comfortable in the station? 
 I bought it off a froggy sailor. 
 I never knew it was snide! 
 EWhere? 
 The docks. 
 So, you were at the docks the night Jacob Marley was murdered? 
 The man you were indebted to. 
 What's that got to do with brandy? 
 Did Marley see you with it? 
 Perhaps you thought he'd report you? 
 You panicked and lashed out at him? 
 It wouldn't be the first time you've used violence, would it? 
 Pa's late. 
 Hello, hello. 
 Hooray, he's back! 
 I've kept your food warm. 
 Good news or bad? 
 Bad. 
 He wants me to work late, every night for the same money. 
 What's the good news? 
 I still have a job. 
 My sister's delighted with your visit, Sir Leicester. 
 She hides her delight very well. 
 She's extremely shy in betraying her emotions with a gentleman as distinguished as you. 
 So I would not make a fool of myself, were I to pursue an interest? 
 She'd be thrilled to see you again, sir! 
 Goodnight. 
 For the last time, I am marrying Captain Hawdon and that is the end of it. 
 What kind of marriage will you have to a penniless soldier compared to one with a wealthy baronet? 
 A kind I fear you'll never know. A happy one. 
 Right. Well, if that's all... 
 It isn't. You've only given me half a statement. 
 That's all I can remember. 
 Perhaps a night in the cells might jog your memory. 
 I did see Marley... briefly, an' he wasn't alone. 
 Who was with him? 
 Gent. Distinguished sort. 
 Seemed him and Marley had some sort of a set-to. Don't know what about. 
 Left 'em to it. 
 Any other details about this "gent"? 
 Well, it was dark... but as he passes me, I sees something glint in the dim glow of a lamp. 
 I remember now. 
 What was it? 
 A badge. 
 Flower shaped. 
 Reddish hue, I believe. 
 And Marley said a name - 
 Barney? 
 Barnaby or something? 
 Barnaby? 
 Hold up, no, not tonight. 
 Well, I 'ave to. You know I do. 
 Here. Don't want it crumpled. Gent gave it me. 
 Proper surprise an' all, cos he ain't the sort to give a girl a rose. 
 Maybe you don't know 'im as well as you think. 
 I should go. 
 Ah! A game of three-in-one before you do. 
 Whoever downs the most wins the money. 
 On the count of three - one - two - three. 
 I'm out. I'm out. 
 After you. 
 You... you can pull out, Pocket. Just say the word. 
 Pour. 
 One - two - three! 
 Bravo, cousin! 
 Damn you, sir. 
 Bravo. 
 Fair play. 
 How about we double it with a game of dares? 
 Well, that's if you're up to it, Pocket? 
 More than up to it! 
 Barbary. 
 You don't have to go through with this, Pocket. 
 No, no, no, I am a man of my word! 
 I accepted a dare, so a dare it is! 
 Good man. Your choice. 
 Anything. 
 Anything? 
 You're both insane. 
 ( They laugh ) 
 Heads. 
 You first, Compeyson. 
 Go on, Compeyson, old chap. 
 ( They cheer ) 
 Ready, Pocket? 
 Ready! 
 Aah! 
 Ah! Help! 
 Help! 
 Compeyson! Compeyson! Help him, Compeyson! 
 Compeyson! 
 I don't know what to say - another second... 
 You scared us out of our wits, Pocket! 
 You saved my life. I can't thank you enough! 
 The least I could do.
