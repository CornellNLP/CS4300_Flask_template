 This way. 
 Through those doors. 
 How dare he strut around Satis House like a peacock? 
 It's like he damn well owns the place! 
 Because he soon will. 
 Over my dead body. 
 The wedding is tomorrow. 
 They've already begun preparations. 
 There will be no wedding! 
 What will you do? 
 I intend to expose Meriwether Compeyson for the liar and the fraud that he really is. 
 She's besotted with him. 
 No. 
 No, she is besotted with the man that she thinks he is. 
 That man doesn't exist. 
 I need you to get him away from Satis House. 
 I'll try. 
 Do it. 
 What if Amelia won't listen to you? 
 I won't be alone. We must gather our forces. 
 This madness ends today. 
 As soon as we get back from church, champagne to be served at the door as the guests arrive. 
 One tray to the left and one to the right, best crystal glasses. 
 Yes, Miss Havisham. 
 I want formal napkins on all of the tables, best silver and linens, and more flowers there. 
 Begging your pardon, Miss Havisham. Your dress and veil, Miss. 
 Mary? Show Martha to my room, would you? 
 Lay out the dress. I'll be up shortly. 
 Is Miss Honoria back, Martha? 
 Er, I'm not sure, Miss. 
 It seems I am to be married without my chief bridesmaid. 
 It's only important you and I are there. 
 Nonsense, I'm a Havisham. 
 This has to be the best wedding London society has ever seen. 
 I want people talking about it for years. 
 I think our bankers may be talking about it even longer. 
 Notoriety doesn't come cheap. 
 And as you will be master of Satis House once we're married, this will be my last opportunity to spend this much money without asking your permission! 
 And if I wasn't... 
 ...Master of Satis House? 
 If there was none of this? 
 If you were a shop girl and I was a penniless labourer, from a humble background? Would you still be happy? 
 Why would you ask such a thing? 
 Would you? 
 Yes. 
 Yes, a thousand times yes. 
 And you? 
 A thousand times more. 
 Into the corners. 
 Sir? 
 Must I do everything for this trustees' visit? 
 Where's that painting, Bumble? 
 I have it, my love! 
 Oh. 
 ( Bumble chuckles ) 
 Hold still, boy! 
 Josiah Bounderby, founder of the East London workhouses. 
 It will show the Trustees how mindful we are of their office and how much we value the traditions of our profession. 
 You took the very words from my lips, my strawberry pudding. 
 Where should he hang? 
 In the school room, above the fireplace. 
 It'll cover the hole. 
 How very prudent, my love. 
 I shall fetch a nail. 
 Well, hurry up! 
 This room needs to be finished! 
 Tables back, places set! 
 And you need to be scrubbed and de-loused before the trustees get here. 
 I'm so sorry, I didn't quite catch that... 
 All : Yes, Mrs Bumble. 
 Two plus three? 
 Five, Mrs Bumble. 
 Three plus four? 
 Seven, Mrs Bumble. 
 The Lord's prayer... 
 Our Father, who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name. 
 Thy kingdom come, thy will be done in earth as it is in heaven... 
 ON earth! ON earth as it is in heaven! 
 ...On earth as it is in heaven. 
 Sir Leicester will be calling on you this afternoon. 
 Father believes he intends to ask for your hand. 
 I see. 
 You are to be Lady Dedlock. 
 If that's the path you choose. 
 Of course. That goes without saying. 
 Does it? 
 Are we to keep up this pretence forever? 
 Pretence? 
 That I have a choice in the matter. 
 Honoria... 
 I was in love. 
 Love, Frances! Can you even remember the word? 
 My feelings counted for nothing then, so why pretend they do now? 
 I'm... I'm sorry, Honoria, but that's simply not true. 
 Then, when Sir Leicester calls, tell him I do not wish to see him and that you will return all the money you have taken from him. 
 Sever all contact! 
 I'm sorry, Father. 
 I'm not asking that of you. 
 All I ask is that we stop the pretence, at least with each other. 
 I don't know what you want from me! 
 That we no longer speak of this union with Sir Leicester as something wonderful - something I should be grateful for. 
 You shouldn't speak like that, not after all that Father has done for us. 
 Do not talk to me of sacrifice and family duty, Frances. 
 I may be found wanting in many things, but not that! 
 Never that. 
 He's up, my love! 
 Come and see that it suits. 
 I'm busy, Bumble. 
 It's not upside down, is it? 
 No, my precious. 
 Mr Bounderby looks down at us from due North, as intended. 
 Do I give them dumplings, Bumble? 
 An excellent idea, my one true love. 
 Two each for the trustees, one each for the children? 
 More than sufficient. 
 Very generous. 
 Once the trustees have seen the manner in which we run this establishment and tasted your dumplings, our promotion is assured. 
 Will it be, Bumble? You're certain? 
 Not a single doubt. 
 And we will be raised up? 
 Yes, yes. 
 A new house? 
 A maid. 
 New clothes? 
 Underclothes. 
 Shoes? 
 Stockings. 
 Oh, Bumble! 
 How we'll celebrate! 
 We'll have a party! 
 No, I... 
 For three. 
 Three? 
 You... 
 You... 
 ...and little Bumble. 
 ( Bumble chuckles ) 
 Fetch the suet, Bumble. 
 Gentlemen, the other board members are joining us later. Thank you. 
 Thank you for coming. 
 I have better things to be doing than sitting with you in The Three Cripples. 
 You can spare an hour, surely? 
 Actually, escaping your sister's madness for an hour would be very welcome. 
 And tomorrow, we shall be family. 
 Yes. 
 I do hope we can find a way to become friends again, Arthur - real friends. 
 It would make Amelia very happy. 
 Me, too. 
 And you shall prove it by buying the first drink. 
 Who knows? Maybe our invitations got lost in the post. 
 Or perhaps they're having them delivered personally by one of their footmen. 
 Well, if they are, I won't be accepting. 
 I've better things to do than drinking champagne and waltzing around with some great lump of lard - not with my hips. 
 Champagne sounds nice, though. 
 Oh, no, I had it once - gave me terrible wind. 
 Oh? 
 All night, I had it. I kept waking meself up. 
 Oh! 
 Hello, Bob. 
 He said I can have 15 minutes for lunch. 
 15 minutes? He's not going soft, is he? 
 Hardly. He said, "I'll dock your wages a shilling "for every minute you're late". 
 So, if I'm 15 minutes late, there won't be any wages at all this week. 
 We'd better hurry up then, hadn't we? 
 You seem very chirpy today. 
 Do I? 
 That's cos I'm married to you. 
 Here, hope you're not getting romantic. I've only got 14 minutes. 
 Well... 
 Don't even say it. 
 Good to see you. 
 I only ever wanted us to be happy - to be safe. 
 And if you were to choose one of those things above the other, which would you choose? 
 They're here, my turtle dove! 
 Ooh, line them up! 
 Spoon drill - and you act as though you eat as well as this every day. 
 Children, line up! Quickly, as rehearsed. 
 Now, bow when addressed. 
 Speak when spoken to. 
 Spoon drill! 
 Hold, two three. 
 Dip, two, three. 
 Up, two, three. 
 Eat, two, three... 
 Hold, two, three. 
 Dip, two, three. Up, two, three... 
 ( Knocks at door ) 
 Hush. Now, stay in line. 
 And stand straight - shoulders back. 
 Coming! 
 Ah, Mrs Tisher, gentlemen, please come in. 
 Children, say hello to our esteemed guests. 
 Welcome, Mr Gradgrind. 
 Welcome, Mr Bagstock. 
 Welcome, Reverend Crisparkle. 
 Welcome, Mrs Tisher. 
 Welcome all. 
 My wife, Mrs Bumble. 
 Dear, Mr Gradgrind, you know. 
 Of course. 
 May I also present Mr Bagstock, late of Her Majesty's armed forces... 
 Madam. 
 ...the Reverend Crisparkle... 
 Reverend. 
 ...and Mrs Tisher. 
 Pleasure, I'm sure. 
 So, where would you like to start? 
 To the dormitory, perhaps? 
 Perfect. Follow me. 
 
 
 
 Matthew? 
 Cousin. 
 When did you get back? 
 Last night. It was too late to call on you. 
 Gentlemen? 
 I asked them to come. 
 Can I ask why? 
 Perhaps we should talk privately? 
 Of course. 
 So, cousin, it seems you have something on your mind. Something pressing? 
 I'm sorry, Amelia, but we care for you - far too much to allow this marriage to go ahead. 
 Really? 
 Don't you see? 
 Once married, all your assets will be transferred to Mr Compeyson and that cannot be allowed to happen. 
 I have the full support of the board and they in turn have the support of the shareholders. 
 Do they? 
 The man is a charlatan. 
 You know nothing of his past, of his family. 
 I can find no-one in London to speak on his behalf and yet, you are content to hand him the entire Havisham estate! 
 It's beyond me... 
 Gentlemen, can I ask you to wait outside? 
 I believe this to be a family matter. 
 It's about the company, too. 
 Then, as the owner of that company, I'd ask you to do as I say. 
 You have registered your disapproval of my marriage to Mr Compeyson, now please, wait outside. 
 You may very well be happy, Compeyson, but things have hardly worked out the way I planned, have they? 
 Plans need to change, adapt, react to circumstances. 
 Oh, really? 
 Yes. 
 You're so clever, aren't you? 
 All hail Meriwether Compeyson(!) 
 This is why you came back? 
 You cannot go through with this. You don't even know the man. 
 I am simply saying what your father would say if he was here. 
 And what right have you to speak for my father? 
 I am family. 
 And because of that, I have no reason to say what I do except to protect you. 
 From who, Matthew? 
 From Meriwether Compeyson. 
 Even from yourself, if I have to. 
 You've only known him for a few months. 
 You were still grieving for your father, the argument with Arthur... 
 You were alone, vulnerable. 
 ...And stupid? 
 No. 
 That's what you're thinking, Matthew. 
 That I'm a silly little girl whose head was turned by the first man who paid her any attention. 
 Quite the opposite, cousin. 
 I think you are the most remarkable woman that I know. 
 All I am asking is that you stop - just for a second. 
 Ignore your heart, because I've no doubt that you've given it to him. 
 And use your head, Amelia. 
 Like your father would have done. 
 Like a Havisham. 
 ( She sighs ) 
 But I love him. 
 I know you do. 
 And you can still be with him, even marry him one day, but not now. 
 Not this quickly. 
 I urge caution, but I do so with no ulterior motive - nothing to gain, I want nothing. 
 I do it only because I care about you... 
 ...as I have always cared about you. 
 I'm still the same Matthew. 
 You once called me your North Star... 
 ...the one you trusted above all others. 
 Trust me now. 
 So, what will you do with the Havisham fortune once you get your grubby little hands on it? 
 Ah... 
 Enjoy it. 
 Gambling? 
 Prostitutes? 
 Perhaps. 
 And if you're good, I may throw you a bone from time to time. 
 Or perhaps I shall throw you a bone. 
 ( Laughter ) 
 You know, Havisham, I've missed this side of you. 
 And what side would that be? 
 Arrogant. Smug. 
 Perhaps it's just breeding - something you wouldn't understand. 
 But what have you to be smug about, Arthur? 
 Wouldn't you like to know? 
 And why would you invite me for a drink in the middle of the day? 
 More ale! 
 Wait! Where are you going? 
 I may be wrong - everyone may be wrong - but please, Amelia, at the very least, postpone the wedding. 
 Insist on a longer engagement. 
 If Compeyson is the gentleman you believe him to be, then why would he refuse? 
 But everything has been arranged. 
 We can say that you were taken ill... 
 ...that it's a postponement, nothing more. 
 Matthew! 
 What a delightful surprise. 
 I doubt that. 
 Oh, my darling. You look troubled. 
 I have told her she must call this wedding off. 
 Matthew, please. 
 Of course you have. 
 I wouldn't expect anything else. 
 So, you've returned from the colonies a success, I take it, with an enormous fortune? 
 No. 
 I am simply here to prevent my cousin from making a terrible mistake. 
 The mistake of not marrying you? 
 No! 
 Meriweather! 
 Come, Matthew - I have heard you're a man who speaks the truth. 
 I like to think so. 
 Then, as a man who speaks the truth, can I ask you to explain to your cousin why you suddenly decided not to stay to help her with the brewery, but to travel to the colonies instead? 
 You're twisting things. That is not what this is about. 
 I don't understand. 
 Your cousin told me... 
 In confidence, sir! 
 A gentleman would be entitled to that confidence, not a snake who calls on a man's fiancee the day before his wedding in order to steal her from him! 
 Your cousin left after confiding in me that he was in love with you. 
 I... 
 He told me he was going to the colonies to earn his fortune, so he could come back to ask for your hand in marriage. 
 Is this true? 
 Yes... 
 No doubt hearing of our marriage, he came back to put a stop to it, so he can have you for himself. 
 No! 
 Do you deny you wanted Amelia for yourself? 
 How could I? 
 He said I shouldn't trust you. 
 I spoke the truth. None of us know who he is! 
 Then I suggest you ask Mr Jaggers. 
 He is your family lawyer, is he not? 
 Jaggers? 
 He searched my background - quite thoroughly, by all accounts. 
 He had no right to do such a thing without my permission. 
 Why didn't you tell me? 
 Because while it's clear your brother wants to steal the estate and your cousin wants you for himself, my concern - my only concern - has been for you. 
 But I am tired of it, Amelia - sick of giving you nothing but love and being repaid by those around you with mistrust. 
 Let them have what they want. 
 Call off the wedding! 
 You see what you've done? 
 Meriwether! 
 Please. Don't leave. 
 Amelia, please. Just listen to me. 
 I have listened to you, but all you've done is lied. 
 Put your own self-interest above my feelings. 
 Why would you think I could ever love you in that way? 
 I had hoped that perhaps... 
 My own cousin. My brother. 
 Not one of you wants me to be happy! 
 To marry the man I love! 
 Well, I shall - and damn you all to hell! 
 Neither you, nor Arthur, nor Jaggers, nor anyone who speaks ill of my husband will be welcome at Satis House ever again, now get out. 
 All of you! Get out! 
 My poor love... 
 ...who can I ever trust but you? 
 I hope you don't mind me feeding the children first? 
 Of course not, Mrs Bumble. 
 It is most refreshing to see the children put first. 
 We try, Reverend. 
 Don't we, children? 
 Children : Yes, Mrs Bumble. 
 You're not too soft, I hope, Bumble. 
 A child without discipline is a carriage without a driver. 
 Oh, no, sir. 
 I do assure you, these children are no strangers to discipline. 
 Are you, children? 
 Children : No, Mr Bumble. 
 But they must be educated - language, mathematics. 
 And educated they will be, Mr Gradgrind. 
 Three plus four, children. 
 Children : Seven, Mrs Bumble. 
 Kindness, discipline and education are all paramount of course, but do their souls not need to be fed? 
 Children... 
 Our father, who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name. 
 Thy kingdom come, thy will be done. 
 On Earth as it is in heaven. 
 Well? 
 Compeyson came back. 
 She took his side. 
 We must resolve ourselves to it, there's nothing more to be done. 
 Well, there must be something! 
 No, Arthur, there isn't. 
 She trusts no-one but him. 
 None of us are welcome in Satis House ever again. 
 I'm leaving tonight. 
 No! No! 
 I couldn't bear to be here for the wedding. 
 But what's to become of me? 
 I'm sorry, Arthur. 
 If only your father were here. 
 If we are considered for the new position, Mrs Bumble and I would hope to maintain the very high standards you have seen before you this evening. 
 It is not the paint on the walls, or the food in the belly which will allow these children to enter society. 
 It is the examples that they are given. 
 I couldn't agree more, Mr Gradgrind. 
 Mr Bumble is forever making an example of himself. 
 And backbone! Discipline! 
 Discipline! 
 Respect! 
 Respect! 
 Child : Please, sir? 
 I want some more. 
 ( Bumble growls ) 
 I wish you didn't have to go. 
 It's for the last time. 
 Tomorrow, you will be my wife and I will never leave your side again. 
 Out! Out! Out! Out! 
 GO! GET AWAY! 
 Bumble, in! 
 ( Child whimpers ) 
 ( Compeyson whistles )
