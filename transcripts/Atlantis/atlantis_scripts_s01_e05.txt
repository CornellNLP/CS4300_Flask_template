 (soldiers march) 
 I love you more than anything. 
 I know. 
 Gods be with you. 
 And you. 
 Aah! 
 Don't be afraid. 
 I mean you no harm. 
 I have a message for you. 
 Princess Ariadne. 
 Run. 
 Guards! 
 There's nowhere left for you to run. 
 (arrow strikes) 
 Argh! 
 Do we know who this man is? 
 He has yet to regain consciousness. 
 I thought Princess Ariadne might be able to tell us more. 
 Ariadne. 
 Did you recognise the man who attacked you? 
 I'd never seen him before. 
 What became of him? Did he escape? 
 He was wounded by one of the archers. 
 Did this man say anything to you? 
 He demanded my jewellery and said he would hurt me if I did not comply. 
 Mm. 
 He said nothing else? 
 I'm not inclined to converse with thieves. 
 (she chuckles) 
 Must have been a terrible shock for you. You look pale. 
 You should get some sleep. 
 Would you please escort Ariadne to her chambers? 
 Do you believe her? 
 Why would a thief attempt to steal from the king's daughter? 
 There are far easier pickings in the city. 
 No... 
 Ariadne seemed more concerned for the man's fate than for her own safety. 
 Then what did this man want with her? 
 We shall have to persuade him to tell us. 
 Do not fail me, my friend. 
 Excuse me, sorry, sorry... 
 (he chuckles) 
 I can't believe you talked us into betting what little money we have on a beetle. 
 Hercules told me his beetle has never lost a race. 
 That's true. Never actually been in a race, though, has it? 
 That is also true, but I swear to you, it's as swift as an eagle. 
 An eagle? Really? 
 Well, maybe not that swift, but it's swift for a beetle. 
 We have to get our money back. 
 Well, it's not all our money. 
 I have some gold coins hidden under the floorboards in my chamber. 
 You HAD some gold coins under the floorboards in your chamber. 
 I have gambled them on your behalf. 
 (knocking) 
 Ooh... 
 Ahem. 
 (all shout encouragement) 
 Go on! Go on, run! 
 Run faster! 
 Run faster, faster. 
 I will squash you like a fly. Go! 
 Go! 
 (all shout) 
 Yes! 
 We did it! 
 We're rich! We did it! 
 (door clangs) 
 What is it you want with the princess Ariadne? 
 I meant to rob her. 
 Hm. 
 I don't believe you. 
 I can give you jewels. 
 All you ever dreamed of. 
 But you must tell me the truth. 
 I can give you jewels... or pain. That is all. 
 What is it you want with Ariadne? 
 I meant to rob her. 
 Then you have made your choice. 
 Fetch me when he's ready to talk. 
 Argh! 
 Is there something troubling you, Ariadne? 
 I'm told the intruder was caught, he cannot harm you. 
 He meant me no harm. 
 There is something I must ask of you. 
 I would not do so if it were not important. 
 What in earth are you doing? 
 I'm fetching breakfast. 
 I've seen him eat worse when he's drunk. 
 Not for me, you fool, it's for Astrabacus. 
 Who's Astrabacus? 
 It's the name I've given to my beetle. 
 You've named him? 
 After his victory last night, it's no less than he deserves. 
 Astrabacus? You don't think that's a little grand? 
 For a dung beetle? 
 You may mock all you like, but Astrabacus is the most valuable possession we have. 
 That is truly depressing. 
 Korinna! 
 What are you doing here? 
 I was hoping I might speak with you. 
 Alone. 
 I've received word that the man I love is at the ruined palace at Synas. 
 I must journey there if I am to see him. 
 Why can't he come to Atlantis? 
 He was accused of a crime he didn't commit and forced to flee the city. 
 If he returns, he faces imprisonment. 
 The mountains are full of robbers and it isn't safe for me to travel alone. 
 But if I don't go, he will think I have forsaken him. 
 So you want me to escort you? 
 I wouldn't ask if there were any other way. 
 It's been many months since I've seen him. 
 Then I'll take you to him. 
 Thank you. 
 For whom do you make an offering? 
 I ask the gods to look favourably upon all those I care for. 
 The intruder from last night... 
 It would seem that robbery was not his true purpose. 
 He told you this himself? 
 Not yet. 
 But he shall talk, soon enough. 
 I will leave you to your prayers. 
 Uh...what are you doing? 
 I'm giving Astrabacus some mountain air. 
 It will make him strong. 
 You brought him with you? 
 Where I go, he goes. 
 If I didn't know better, I'd say you were in love. 
 I heard you were in love with Medusa. 
 Has she said something? 
 Does she speak of me often? 
 No. Pythagoras told me. Did I? 
 It may have slipped out. 
 You'll have to console yourself with the love of your dung beetle. 
 He's a better friend to me than you. 
 Pasiphae : I admire your courage. 
 Lesser men would have broken by now. 
 I have told you all I know. 
 We shall see. 
 (he pants in pain) 
 (hissing sound) 
 (she chants) Please...! No more! Tell me what it is you wish to know and I will end your pain. What is it you want with Ariadne? Argh! I...I was...to... I was to deliver a message. A message? Who was it from? It was...from...her brother. (He's dead.) The prince lives. He is here? In Atlantis? He waits for her at Synas. You promised...to end my pain. And I will. (blade rings) Argh! (the oracle chants) You told me Therus was dead. How is it I've just learned that he lives? I did not say the prince was dead. I said he was lost at sea. You deliberately misled me! The images I see are not always clear. You must interpret them as you can. And what else have you told me that I can no longer trust? I speak the truth when I tell you now that your hunger for power will lead to bloodshed and suffering. (pasiphae laughs) And you think you can stop me? With your lies and deceit? It is not I who will stop you. And what about your own future? Hm? What do you see for yourself? The gods will not allow me to see my own destiny. Then do not make the mistake of thinking that you are...untouchable. Mislead me again, and I shall determine your fate for you. How can that be? You told me Therus was dead. I believed it to be true. If Ariadne were to learn the true reason he fled Atlantis... We cannot allow that to happen. Take a squad of soldiers to Synas. Kill Therus. Burn his body. He is the king's son. Do you think Ariadne will accept your hand in marriage if she learns the truth? If you wish to take the throne, you will do as I say. They've been attacked by thieves. Shouldn't we at least bury the bodies? Mountain paths are littered with corpses. We can't bury them all. My lord, if I'm to give orders to my men, I must know the nature of my mission. It seems the intruder was part of a plot to kidnap Ariadne. The other conspirators are hiding out at Synas. Your men are to take no prisoners. Do not fear, Ariadne. We've learned why the intruder was in the palace. And why was that? He was sent by your brother. It seems the traitor has returned. I do not believe he is a traitor. It's been hard for all of us to accept his betrayal - you more than anyone. Fortunately, the intruder has told us where Therus is hiding. Heptarian rides to Synas as we speak. What will Heptarian do if he finds Therus? Ah, now... No - it's best not to think about it. You've been through quite an ordeal. Therus will soon be dead. This will all be over. I will continue alone. Are you sure it's safe? (muffled scream) You cry out, it'll be the last thing you do. Who are you? I bring word from your sister. What are they doing in there? Really, Pythagoras? Do I have to explain with diagrams? They will not thank us for interrupting them... You can trust them, they're my friends. I'm ready to return to Atlantis. Really? That was quick. The light's fading. The mountain paths are too dangerous in the dark. We should make camp for the night. 
 
 Ariadne. What is it? It's nothing. I was just taking some air. What troubles you? I was thinking of Therus. There isn't a day that passes when he does not enter my thoughts. When I learned of his betrayal... There is no greater sadness. Therus loved and respected you. I cannot believe he meant you any harm. Those he plotted with confessed - why would he flee the city if it were not true? With Therus gone, you are more precious to me than ever. I do not say it often enough. (blade rings) Hm... What is it? I don't believe they've ever been lovers. They've barely said two words to each other. Why would Korinna lie to us? I don't know. We should be on our guard. (hercules snorts) Shh! Soldiers. Astrabacus! Hercules, no! Oh! Praise the gods! Ugh! (swords clash) You would risk your life for a beetle? He's like family to me. Go! What are soldiers from Atlantis doing out here in the middle of the night? They're here for you, aren't they? For what crime did you flee the city? I was accused of plotting to kill my father...the king. You're Prince Therus? The king's son? I know a hunting lodge in the mountains. We'll be safe there. Great - now we're traitors. You know what they do to traitors... I have a pretty good idea. You mean to tell me he escaped? I have scouts searching the mountains. He will not get far. No. No, what Therus seeks is not to be found in the mountains. It is here... In Atlantis. Ariadne? She will not be able to resist the thought of seeing her brother. She will lead us to him. Astrabacus needs to build up his strength. Breakfast - most important meal of the day. Where are you going? I must go to Ariadne myself. It's too dangerous for you to enter the city. They'll be searching for you. It's the only way. We'll bring your sister to you. Are you completely out of your mind? You intend to smuggle the princess Ariadne out of Atlantis, under the nose of the queen and the entire garrison? Yes. You would do this for me? I would do it for your sister. Surely after all that has happened, Ariadne will be under guard. You won't be able to get to her. I won't. Corrina will. Wait at the servants' entrance above the Northern Gate. I'll send Ariadne to you. Corrina. I was so worried for you, I feared you'd been caught. Therus, is he alive? Your brother is safe, he's in the mountains. I must go to him. I believe that's what's expected of you. You're being watched. Out of my way! Lord Heptarian. Will you help me find my brother? Your Highness. Ariadne is missing. We fear she may have been abducted. Seal the city. She cannot be allowed to leave, I want her found. I will see to it. Ariadne must not reach her brother. She cannot be allowed to learn the truth. Is there something troubling you? What is it? You could have told me the truth about your brother. I would have gladly helped you. You asked me and my friends to risk our lives on a lie. I'm sorry, I shouldn't have done that. It's difficult for me to know who I can trust. You can trust me, Ariadne. (bells toll in distance) They've discovered I'm missing. We need to get off the streets. (man shouts out in distance) This is where you live? Yes. For now. You should change your clothes if we're to escape the city. Here. Oh, you can change in there. Thank you, Jason. (he sighs) (loud clattering) (ariadne coughs) (she coughs) (knock at door) Is everything all right? You keep horse dung in jars? No! Well, yes, but it's not mine, it belongs to Hercules. For his pet beetle. He has a beetle for a pet? Yes. Hercules is a man of many strange and disgusting habits. How do I look? You look... Well, you don't look like a princess. Good. You've tidied up. No. I mean... Not really. I was looking for something, a bowl. Which I found. Er... It's not for now, it's for another time. We should go. Erm... Yeah. Have they found her? No. The city is sealed, the search continues. I've already lost one child, I cannot bear to lose another. You did not lose Therus, he betrayed you. We must pray to the Gods that Ariadne is found. The Gods punish me for taking the throne. For all that we did to seize power. This is not the work of the gods, it is the work of men and they will be caught. They will be executed. I always thought that I desired the throne more than anything. Perhaps... I have paid a price that is too high. You cannot truly believe that. I'm no longer certain what I believe. Be certain of this. If you show weakness, our enemies will strike, and you will lose everything including... your beloved daughter. Run. That's it. Run, run like the wind! (he chuckles) Yeah, he has the legs of a gazelle and the heart of a lion. Have you met Extrapicus? I'll fetch some water. (door clicks open) (door shuts) Therus may be a prince among men but you are a prince among beetles. You seem to be getting very attached. I fear beetles only live a short time. Then our time together will be even more precious. (in distance) I said, open the bag! We'll never make it past the guards. We need to find another way out of the city. Go. You there - stop! Come with me. Why are you helping me? I serve the King. (door slams) Jason should have returned by now. I'm sure he's fine, you should eat something. I have no appetite. Where's Therus? (with mouth full) He's fetching some water. I have no idea what you're saying. I said, he's fetching some water. You're making me anxious with all this pacing around. Sit, eat. Eat what? A moment ago, you said you had no appetite. (horse whinnies outside) What was that? Oh, look what you've done, you clumsy idiot! That's Extrapicus. He's gone. Well, he can't have gone far. Extrapicus. You do realise he's a beetle and he can't understand you? Just help me find him. Extrapicus. (squashing sound) Oh, no. What was it? I... I think I may have just... trodden on Extrapicus. No! (squelching) Oh, it's a spider! It's just a spider! Oh, praise the gods! Oh, there he is there! Don't crush him. I'm not crushing him. You're crushing him! I'm not. Ohh... Thought I'd lost you! (door opens) Oh, erm... Hey... It's his pet beetle. I did not dare to believe it was really you. You've grown up. You were just a little girl when I last saw you. It's been over ten years, Therus. I know. I'm sorry. I cannot tell you how good it is to look upon you with my own eyes. My little sister. Thank you for bringing her to me. Perhaps you could give us some time alone. You must be thirsty after your journey. Thank you. Why did you leave? I do not believe that you conspired to kill our father. Say it isn't so. Just before I came of age, I uncovered a plot. I was to be killed. It was Pasiphae. She was behind it. When I learned the truth, she knew I would tell the king. There was no plot to kill him. Pasiphae created it to discredit me. She knew I'd have no choice but to flee. What of the men who confessed to plotting with you? Pasiphae threatened to murder their families if they didn't say I was a traitor. Those men were innocent. Pasiphae had them executed to protect herself. I always knew she desired the throne. I did not know she'd go to such lengths. She'll do anything to seize power. She will kill anyone who stands between her and the throne. All those years ago, it was me. But now that person is you. You come of age soon. You will become heir to the throne. Your life is in danger. Our father would never let any harm come to me. As much as you love him, he is no match for Pasiphae. He can no more protect you than he was able to protect me. You must come away with me and never return to Atlantis. I can't do that. I will not leave Atlantis. I feared you would say that. Forgive me, sister. Jason, we were worried about you. At least, I was. I had more important things to worry about. Pythagoras nearly stood on Astrabacus. I didn't nearly stand on Astrabacus, it was a spider. Princess Ariadne with you? She's inside with Therus. Do we have any food? I'm starving. Prince Therus ate all the bread. That's royalty for you. They don't think about anyone but themselves. What is it? It's belladonna. A powerful sedative. (horse neighs outside) Why would Therus drug his own sister? I'm going after them. (bird screeches) (therus groans) Ariadne. Why are you doing this? Ariadne's life is in danger. I have to take her away. If you will drug her, she has no say in the matter. I have to protect her. If you care for her at all, you will let us go. I care for your sister more than anything. I will not let you take her against her will. Then I have no choice but to kill you. I would gladly give my life for her. I must do this. I'm sorry. No! Therus, I cannot go with you. I will not leave the people to the mercy of Pasiphae. It is my duty to stay in Atlantis. You'll be of no help to the people if you are dead. If it means abandoning the city and turning my back on those I care for... then I would rather be dead. Lower your sword. Please. You must go. And I must stay. I hope someday, I might be able to return. I wish for that more than anything. I will send word when I can. Is he a part of the reason you stay in Atlantis? As I said... there are many people I care for. Farewell, little sister. Farewell. I cannot thank you enough for everything you've done. I must go. Ariadne. In the forest when Therus had his sword to me... how much of what I said did you hear? Very little. I was still a little drowsy. What did you say? Nothing, really. No, I was just curious. Ariadne. Where have you been? The entire garrison has been searching for you. If they thought to look for me in the temple, they would have found me consulting with the oracle. I'm sorry if I've caused you concern. And what did the oracle tell you of your future? She warned me that I must be careful. It seems there are those who plot against me. Do you really expect me to believe that you were with the oracle? I no longer care what you believe. I see you exactly for what you are. (door opens) I have been out of my mind! I feared something had happened to you! I am perfectly safe. I cannot bear the thought of any harm coming to you. I love you more than anything in this world. And I you. Come, let me walk you to your chamber. We've been through a lot these past few days, you and I. I risked my life for yours, now it's time for you to repay that debt. (knock on the table) Come on! (cheers and shouts of encouragement) What happened?! I believe that's my shirt you're wearing. You bet your shirt? I was confident of victory. Your shirt, if you will. What if the beetle we found at the farmstead wasn't Astrabacus but an entirely different beetle? You think of that now? Well, all beetles are alike. No, they're clearly not all alike, otherwise I would not be standing before you without the shirt on my back. What about your beetle? That is not my beetle. He is lazy, slow, and useless. Then I shall call him Hercules. I wish to capture the heart of the woman I love. I've heard your powers are unrivalled. (metallic thrumming) I've been running all my lives. Exterminate! Through time and space.
