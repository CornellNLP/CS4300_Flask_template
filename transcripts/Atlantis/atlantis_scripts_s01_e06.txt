 There's not enough to go around. 
 Give me that. 
 It's ALL muscle. Indeed(!) 
 Right. You're next. 
 (distant cheering) 
 Are you sure about this? 
 Him? He's a mouse. They call him The Destroyer. 
 Of what? Butterflies? 
 I'll have you know, I have never been beaten. 
 Almost never been beaten. 
 Why do they call him The Destroyer? 
 The Destroyed. 
 You're not hearing it right. 
 You need a name. A fighter's name. 
 Hercules the Hairy. Hmm. Too... true. 
 Hercules the Hero. That's my girl. 
 No, that's too wet. 
 Hercules the Horrid. 
 Smelling. 
 Hercules the Horrid-Smelling? 
 That's it! That's the one. 
 (cheering) 
 (crowd whoops) Yes! (mouths) Oh! (they grunt) Yeah! Rip his head off! (crowd cheers) Are you all right? Never better. It was very noble of you to let him win. Come on... This is all your fault, giving me that ridiculous name. What? Oh... (she laughs) Take me home. Stop... Stop fussing! There may be easier ways to get her attention. Whose attention? What are you talking about? She's about so high... dark hair, big eyes. Lovely smile. You think I would put my life on the line just to impress Medusa? Shame on you. I do it for the honour. Wrestling...is...in my blood. Huh... You know, even as a baby I strangled a snake with my bare hands. Is that true? Look, all I'm saying is, if you and Medusa are meant to be together, then she'll love you for who you are. All I'm telling you is this is who I am. Hercules the... No, let's not go there. ..hero, like she said. He's like a bull. Nothing can divert him from his target. I had hoped she would be a passing fancy. Like Drina the cook, or Iola the tailor's wife, or Abellone the trainee guard... Don't ask. I can understand why he might find her attractive. It is more... What she might find attractive in him. Indeed. He has a big heart. And is brave. So he says. And loyal. To his stomach. (they laugh) As much as I love him, I fear she does not feel the same. After all, what can he offer her in terms of security? He has no job. No money. Even this house isn't really his. It cannot end well. Poor Hercules. Poor, foolish Hercules. (cockerel crows) Psst! You must come with me now. the Oracle demands it. I did not summon you lightly. These past days I have felt the presence of the God more strongly than ever before. The same dream haunts me day and night. Even now it invades my thought. I see a figure. A woman of great power. Can you see her face? My dreams are clouded in shadow! Could it be the Queen? Could it be Pasiphae? You are right to fear the Queen. She is dangerous indeed. But Pasiphae stands unabashed in the light. Her intentions are clear. This woman lurks in the darkness, concealing her face... One thing is certain... it's you she seeks. Ah, my good friend, feasting like a king, I see. If mice have kings, then yes. Oh. How are your injuries? I am in fine health. This was no more than a blip on an otherwise untarnished reign of terror. Hercules the Horrid will return. Or Hercules the Foolish, as you would have me known. Enjoy your time in my house. Well, not actually MY house, but you know what I mean. Hercules... I'm sorry. We are worried about you, that is all. Enjoy your breakfast. Hercules. The Gods are smiling on me today. Till tomorrow. My friend... the Goddess of Love is a tough mistress. You know she has my utmost devotion. That will go some way to appeasing her, but you have very little else to offer. You are not a rich man. As everybody suddenly seems to have noticed. I wish only to see you happy. I fear that Aphrodite may never answer your prayers. If you are truly serious about this girl... I am. ..there is another way to capture her heart. An enchantment. Thank you for your concern, but no. Wait. I know nothing of sorcery. Nor do I want to. You have heard of the Witches of Colchis? I've heard nothing good. You know of their powers? Of course. There is talk that one of their number can be found in a cave high in the Mountains of the Sun. You are very kind, Elias, but even if I wanted to, I cannot afford these services. That is where you are wrong. I have heard that rich or poor, the payment is the same - you must give her your most precious possession. (blade slices) Ah. Are we celebrating something? It's for Hercules. What? All of it?! He heard us talking about him last night, on the roof. Oh. Oh, indeed. Where is he? I don't know. He should be back soon. Are you sure? His sword and bag are gone. (he breathes deeply) You seek Circe of Colchis? I do. You will have no need for your weapon here, Hercules. You wonder how I know your name? I wonder what else you know about me. Come, you have no need to be afraid. You have travelled far, your quest must be an important one. It is most important to me. I wish to capture the heart of the woman I love. I am afraid I cannot offer you guidance on such matters. The Fates spin man's moira, not I. I understand that, but I think the Fates need some assistance. I have heard your powers are unrivalled. Please. She means EVERYTHING to me. I've brought an offering... My most valued possession. It is the last remaining link to my father. Go on. At night, he used to tell me the most wonderful stories. I was never happier than in those few moments before sleep. One day he came home with that tooth, plucked from the foaming jaws of Cerberus, the beast that guards the underworld. Or so he said. He told me to keep it beside my bed, to ward off evil spirits. I've done so ever since. I do not give it up lightly. Your story is indeed moving. Tell me, why did you journey here alone? Your friends do not support your desire? My friends think me a fool. I don't believe that. They have risked their lives for you many times, have they not? And they would again. You know what I do believe? I believe the Gods brought us together. If you wish Medusa to fall in love with you, then there is no more powerful an enchantment than that contained in this jar. For it holds the Song of the Sirens. The sound is irresistible. Once opened, make sure you're the first person your love sees and it will not fail you. But think before you use it, Hercules. Such magic is powerful indeed. We are pleased to see you, old friend. What's the matter? Were you afraid I wouldn't come back? Leave you all alone here in this house I don't own. We are truly sorry. It wasn't our intention to upset you. I know. And much as it pains me to admit it, there may be some truth in what you said. Does this mean we're forgiven? Cheese would have sealed the deal. Thank you, Korinna, I need but a moment of her time. If anyone catches you... Don't worry, they won't, for I am nimble of foot. (choral voices sing) Hercules the Hero! Yes, well... What are you doing here? Hercules? Hercules? Yes, erm.... I came to warn you... There's a storm coming. A storm? It appears so. Yes. I might be wrong, of course, but I thought it was best that you knew. How kind. I didn't want you to get wet. I know how frustrating that can be. I wondered if you wanted to meet me this evening? That's, if you're not engaged in other matters. I am not. And I would be delighted. Thank you... I don't mean thank you, I mean... You know what I mean. (door opens) You must go. Till later. Till later. (choir sings softly) All right! Sorry. This is all your fault, this fear. Me? Both of you. "Hercules the Horrid-Smelling"! Go on, then. What? I need answers. Um... Answers aren't really my thing. Me? No, no. It's the least you can do. (he sniffs) Thyme...lemon... and a hint of lavender? Marjoram. Very good. Dare I ask why? Well... (knock at the door) Go on, then. I don't want to look too keen. No! ..body better. Come, my love. This is no place for beauty such as yours. Isn't he wonderful? Farewell. Both : Farewell. (music and chatter) Have you recovered? Lysis. Oh... Ah, yes, The Destroyer. It was nothing. All right, it was agony. Did you see the size of him? I thought you were very brave. You thought I was stupid. No... No. You are not a very good liar. Strength isn't everything. That's true. He may be The Destroyer, but he was totally lacking wit. Or charm. A really very dull fellow. It is so peaceful. My father used to bring me here as a boy. It's still the place I seek when I need to think. It's reassuring to know that whatever happens in the world, the tide still goes out. And the tide still comes back in. Everything else is fleeting, and must be enjoyed as such. That's what led me to seek you out. Not a storm? Not exactly. Well, I am glad you did. (raucous laughter) You know, there were times when I wondered what I was doing in Atlantis. I almost didn't stay. Really? It's been lonely. How could you be lonely? I didn't know. I'm sorry. Don't be, it's in the past. I feel like at last I might have found a home. Thank you, Hercules. Well, not thank you, but you know what I mean. Yes, I do. I really do. 
 
 (choir sings) (knocking) (knocking continues) Oh, cheese! Where did all this come from? There are certain advantages to my place of work. You stole it? Liberated it for the common good. Do not accuse my love of being a petty criminal. Please accept my apologies. We are very grateful. It's nothing! Probably just from working in the kitchens. I think I'm going to be sick. I'd better have that, then. Oh, yes, this is good. Morning, Atos. Has the sun ever seemed warmer? May the Gods shine more brightly on you today, my friend. Here we are. Treasures for my... Medusa? I'll be all right. Medusa! What's wrong with her? I...I don't know. She said she got it working in the kitchens. I don't think so. Then what? This is like nothing I've ever seen before. But you can make her better? Please, Pythagoras. Fetch me some herbs - sticklewort, flaxseed, borage. Well? I'm sorry. There's no change? Give it time, Hercules. You're right. He's right, isn't he? Pythagoras? I don't know. I cannot lose her. Not now. I will try. I will do all I can. She seems to be getting worse. Whatever that is on her skin, it's the result of witchcraft. Is that possible? These things do not happen by accident. But, if I am right, if it is caused by an enchantment... then only an enchantment can cure her. Do not worry about me. I'm not. You're going to be fine. I am so happy to have had these few days with you. I wouldn't change anything about them. Nothing. Nothing at all. It's my fault. It's ALL my fault. I was desperate. I thought about her day and night. Thought about her and... knew I could never be with her. You don't know what it's like. No woman would refuse you. And all you love is your triangles. What was in there? What did you do? I visited Circe. Who? She is a witch. Of Colchis. Hercules... I couldn't bear to be invisible to Medusa any longer. You're not invisible. You near as said it yourself. The jar contained the Song of the Sirens. I've been foolish, very foolish. I must seek out Circe again. I cannot sit here and watch Medusa die. You would trust this Circe after all she has done? You would be lucky to return with your life. Then we have to find another way. (she breathes sharply) Do not worry my love, for you are everything to me... and I will not lose you. I will not. Hercules! I did not expect to see you so soon. I find that hard to believe. What have you done to her? What you asked. Medusa is dying. She loves you, does she not? Why did you think I agreed to help you? Out of the goodness of my heart? What do you want? From you? Very little. You have but a small part to play in the great events that are about to unfold. I saw you in my dreams. You and your friends... How do I heal Medusa? The Gods brought us together for a reason. Answer me. They protect you, don't they? Who? Your friends. We protect each other. They will not sit idly by waiting for you to return. They will seek you out. They will come for you and that is what I planned all along. You have been a fool, Hercules. And you must suffer a fool's Fate. Pythagoras. He's gone. Oh, no. I'm going after him. We can't let him face Circe alone. (knocking at door) Thank you for coming so quickly. Where is she? Through there. Korinna? You must give her this, diluted in water three times a day. If her symptoms worsen, and only if they worsen, you may try this. I will do my best. Are you sure we are doing the right thing? Are the Gods Greek? Well, they have a variety of complex roots... Pythagoras? Yes. What is it? I don't know, but they've been following us since the last clearing. Where's your sword? I don't have one. I do have a small knife I use to sharpen my stylus. At home. Great(!) (pig grunts) (pig oinks) (pig snuffles and grunts) Shoo. Shoo. Shoo! Go. Go! It's as if it's trying to tell you something. I'm trying to tell YOU something. Go away! (pig snorts and oinks) See, the thing is with animals, you have to let them know who's in command. Clearly. You're a natural. (pig grunts) What troubles you, my friend? I was thinking about something the Oracle said. She spoke about a place high in the mountains shrouded in mist. A woman of great power... Circe. If the Oracle has warned you about this woman we should go back. We cannot abandon our friends. And you cannot defy the Gods. I have no choice. I won't think any less of you, if you want to return. Nonsense. You have no hope of defeating this witch without me. Now all will be well. (munching) Oi. Oi! Do pigs like wine? This one does. (pig snores) (flies buzz) (rustling and snuffling) (pig grunts) Shoo. Shoo. Get away with you. Go! What's going on? It's eaten everything. What?! Well, not quite everything. Olive? What? I think I may be losing my mind. Who do you know that is persistent, greedy and will eat everything... except black olives? Who ALWAYS drains the wine skin? Hercules. Precisely. I don't understand. (pig passes wind) Oh! That smell. I know that smell. (Exactly!) Snort once if you are, indeed, my old friend. (pig snorts once) Wait. You mean...? (Circe turned him into a pig.) (he stifles laughter) Right! Well, we should have worked it out sooner really. What with the belly.... It's not very funny though, is it? No. No, it's not. Not if he's stuck like this for ever. Do you think Circe will turn him back? Don't worry old friend. We'll save your bacon. (pig snorts and snuffles) That's good. Thank you! Yeah. (crows caw) (Smenos aerate nun kai iasonos plexath hetairus.) (water ripples and bubbles) Ommata daptontes kai sarka. Ommata daptontes kai sarka... (screeching) ..diartameontes. (distant screeching) (screeching draws near) Run! (unearthly screeching) What was that? I don't know. You could have warned me they live in the forest. They don't. Someone must have summoned it. Would you be worried if I said I think it's after you? No, no. I'd be fine with that. Good. Because I think it's after you. Go! (he whimpers) (creature screeches) (creature moans) Oh... Right. You'll be safe here. You cannot go alone. Think of what the Oracle said. I will return. Right, you look after him, OK? (pig snorts) The Gods were not wrong. You are indeed brave and loyal. What do you know of these things? More than you think. I believe you found Hercules. What do you want? Exactly what I have - you, here, alone. We are allies, you and I. I find that unlikely. We want the same thing. I want to right the wrongs done to my friends. Hercules and Medusa are good people and they deserve no part in your games. I'll help your friends but I have a request. Won't you join me? I haven't always lived like this. Once, I had a husband that I loved. A home. Until someone sought to take those things from me and turn me into this. I have spent many years wondering why and I still have no answer. There are those that are consumed by pure hatred. My sister is such a creature. She does not deserve to live any longer. What does this have to do with me? I want you to kill her. I don't know what you've heard about me but...I am not a murderer. I'm sorry, I can play no part in your revenge. That is your choice. But I have named my price. Can you live with the consequence of saying no? Her story is sad indeed. Sad enough to kill for? I don't think I can do it. I am not a murderer. I know I couldn't. There is no shame in saying no. If I refuse to help her, then I am condemning Hercules and Medusa to death. And how would you feel if failed to save our friends? I will support you... whatever you decide. I would feel I had deserted them and let something very wrong occur. I would feel that I had cared too much for myself. And that is why you are the noblest of us all. All this for the love of a woman. There is much to be said for triangles. Yeah. I had hoped you would return. I do this for my friends. Of course. There is no alliance between you and I. No. And there never will be. As you wish. How do I know I can trust you? I may be many things but I am good for my word. I trust that you are too. I am sure I need not warn you of the consequences if you fail me. Come. We must seal our arrangement in the eyes of the Gods. As Hecate is our witness, you will not cross me. (hissing) You will know when the time is right to strike. Until then, may your injury serve as a reminder of your oath. (he groans) Where will I find your sister? In the Palace Of Atlantis. Where she is Queen. Pythagoras? All is well. She just needs rest. And... And she wants to see me? She doesn't want to see me? I...would leave it for a while. You told her that no words could express my regret? Yes. And that I had suffered... I had spent time as a pig. Yes. What did she say? I think it's... It's probably best forgotten. Pythagoras! She said that a pig was too good for you. Right...well...she could have said worse, I suppose? And that, if she had known, she would have caught you, roasted you and fed you to the birds. Er, she knows I don't like birds. Perhaps I'll leave it a while. She'll come round. I need to speak with you. The figure you saw in your dream. It was the witch. Circe. Because of her, my friends nearly died. My vision was clear. It was you who was in danger. I trust you heeded my warning. (a woman of that power would not)  waste her time on your friends. There is more, is there not? What happened? I had no choice. What did you promise? That I would kill her sister. That I would kill Pasiphae. Jason! Oh, Jason. You have no idea what you have done. Nothing could please us more than the announcement today of the betrothal of our daughter to Poseidon's servant, Heptarian. It cannot be. It cannot. (cheering) (cheering) You could die. (they groan)
