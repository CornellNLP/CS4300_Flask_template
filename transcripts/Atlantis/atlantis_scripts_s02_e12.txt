 I sense something in you, as you sense it in me. 
 You can't deny it. 
 Why am I not dead already? I was due to be hanged. 
 Stop worrying about such things. 
 What have you done? 
 Goran : I have kept my side of the bargain. Now you must keep yours. 
 (Breathes hard) 
 I'd started to think you weren't coming. 
 I said I'd be here. 
 There's something wrong. 
 What is it? 
 (Shouting) 
 Come on. 
 Halt! 
 Over there! 
 We're trapped. 
 (Shouting glass smashes) 
 (Woman screams) We must wait here until it's safe. (Glass smashes) Pythagoras should have returned by now. This is a fool's errand. I won't leave Diocles rotting in a cell. Why don't we lock ourselves in with him? Save Pasiphae the trouble. I have a debt to pay. I mean to honour it. Pythagoras : How is your father? You said he was sick. He was. He's much better now. It's a clear night. Pythagoras : I sometimes wonder how the sky can be so full of stars. I once spent several long nights trying to count them. How many are there? I don't know. One star looks much the same as another. Perhaps if I were to divide the sky into quadrants, then... Only you would think of doing such a thing. I'm sorry. I'm boring you. I'm never bored in your company. It's been a long while since a patrol has passed. (Hammering at door) (Door creaks) Are you certain you weren't followed? I made sure of it. Icarus has found a way for us to get into the arena. From there, we should be able to break into the cells. Icarus, tell Jason he's insane and we're all going to be caught and executed. Look, you can see it in his face. He thinks it's madness, utter madness. We should go. (Sighs) (Bolt clicks) Oh, great(!) The sewers. I can already taste the stench. Oh! Head north. After about 500 paces, you'll come to another grate. It will bring you out in the arena, underneath the stands. (Water splashes) Meet me at the hunting lodge in three days' time. Bring whatever supplies you can. Pythagoras? May the gods be with you. And you too. (Shouting) (Water splashes) Cilix : Nicomedas wishes for his son to be trained as a priest. I don't see how that's any concern of mine. Nicomedas is a powerful man. You may need his support in these uncertain times. Very well. I will speak with Melas. What is it? My informant was right. Jason plans to break a prisoner out of the cells beneath the amphitheatre. He is making his way there as we speak. Cilix : You cannot afford to hesitate. Jason must be caught and he must be killed. Leave us. You would really see him die? I have no choice. This night... it ends. (Footsteps depart) This must be it. (Grunts) Jason! (Fighters grunt swords clash) (Keys jangle) Jason? I thought you were dead. How is this possible? Are you coming? What about the others? I cannot leave them. This is suicide. It's worse than suicide, whatever that is. If you want your freedom, come with us. I'd come to believe I would die in this place. You saved my life. I wasn't going to forget that. (Arrows swoosh) Run! Run! They were waiting for us. Icarus... Go! Make for the alley! Pythagoras, go! Now, wait here. I'll scout ahead. (Shouting) (Shouts) Hercules : Jason! Goran : Jason was injured and unarmed. My men had him at their mercy. The only reason he is still alive is because of your niece. No, she would never betray me like that. I saw it with my own eyes. Cilix : She is no longer to be trusted. (Breathes hard) (Sobs) (Twig snaps) Leon? I thought you were dead. A few of us managed to escape. Is this all of you? The others were cut down. None were spared. I'm truly sorry. You're not to blame. You gave them a better chance than they would have had otherwise. We should make for our camp. Thinking about Icarus, aren't you? You'll see him soon enough. Come on. (Metal clinks) Father? Hey. My son. Drink this. Mm. If they're going to kill me, why are they allowing you to give me medicine? Don't think about that now. Every day I think I am to be executed, and yet every day you come in their place? Drink some water. Why? Why am I still alive? Just be thankful that you are. I can always tell when you're keeping something from me. I had no choice. What did you do? It's better that you do not know. Tell me. I'm your father. They wanted information. About what? Jason and Pythagoras. No, no. No, no, no, no, no. I had to. It was the only way to stop them from executing you. You stupid boy. But Jason and Pythagoras are unharmed. They escaped. That changes nothing. What are you going to do? Keep on betraying them until they're both caught and killed? I couldn't see you die. I would rather die than have a traitor for a son. Get out. Get out! Please... Father... I have never been so ashamed. (Sighs) How long have you been there? Pasiphae : A while. When you were younger, I would often sit with you while you slept. You had such terrible nightmares. You... you would call out for me. I would hold you till you fell back to sleep. Such a troubled child. Were you dreaming of Jason? I do not remember. You said his name. It is only natural that you would be drawn to him. It is almost like I feel what he feels. He's a part of me, and I am a part of him. Is that why you saved his life? You would deny it? I could not see him die. The bond between you is stronger than I realised. I should have done more to protect you from your feelings. I do not want protecting from them. I have never felt like this about anyone. You love him? Oh, my poor child. Whatever feelings you have for him, you must banish them from your mind. I don't know if I can. He's always in my thoughts. You thought you could turn him. But it is he who has turned you... and I will not allow that to happen. If you try and see Jason again, you will leave me no choice. I will slit your throat and watch you bleed at my feet. I nurtured you when others shunned you. All that you are, all that you have, is because of me. (Medea gasps) More than anyone, I understand what you're feeling. But you will soon come to realise just how misguided those feelings are. (Twig snaps wings flutter) (Twig snaps) Whispers : Jason. Your Majesty. It's not I you should kneel before. Jason is the true heir to the throne. How can that be? He is the son of King Aeson. For too long, Atlantis has been ruled by those who have no rightful claim to the throne. They've ruled through tyranny and fear. That must change. All this time... We fought together, shared a cell. You said nothing. A king must earn loyalty, not demand it. Then you have more than earned mine. He speaks for all of us. So... we're sharing our camp with a bunch of cut-throats and thieves. They can hunt. I'll give 'em that. I should take my turn on watch. It seems you have a new army. It's hardly an army. More will join. You inspire loyalty. There was a time when I asked for your hand in marriage... And I said yes. I would say yes again. I've come to realise that the future's so uncertain. Every day is precious. I cannot wait any longer. Marry me... here in the forest, and let us never be apart again. Estin eros hagnos, tis gar prodidosin erastes. Estin eros hagnos, tis gar prodidosin erastes. (Door creaks) (Footsteps approach) Nuun zetema kratos psuukhes en benthesin autes. (Chokes) Uden gar bios est'ei me nekuuessin oneiros. (Procession chants) (Procession chants) (Blade scrapes) (Chants) Goran : The man who was watching Medea was found dead. We must assume she has fled the city. And no-one saw her? It is the eve of the solstice. The streets are filled with worshippers. Foolish girl. What are your orders? It seems Medea has made her choice. Hunt her down and kill her. First her son, now her niece. It seems the Queen is running out of allies. There are still those of us who remain loyal. I count myself chief among them. But these are troubling times. Who knows what the future may hold? What is certain is that men like us will shape it. I do not have time for your idle speculation. Of course. You must do as you are bid. (Birds tweet) (Crow caws) What are you doing here? I wanted to see you again before I left. I'm returning home to Colchis. Why? What's happened? Pasiphae's protected me since I was a child. I realise now that she nurtured me so I would become like her. But I cannot. I won't. None of us will know peace until Pasiphae is defeated. I can help you. How? It is the winter solstice. Pasiphae must travel tonight to the temple of Chthonia at Nemi. She's sure to be well protected. On the journey, yes. But the temple is the seat of Hecate's power. The goddess guards it jealously. No mortal man may enter, only those touched by the gods. She will be alone. This will help you. What is it? The nectar of the passionflower. If it is imbibed, it will lessen Pasiphae's power. You will not defeat her otherwise. Thank you. It seems you're always coming to my aid. I should go. I have a long journey ahead of me. What is it? There's a part of me that doesn't want you to go. No, I can't. I know you have affection for me. I feel it. Shh, shh. I'm married to Ariadne. I'm sorry. Then this is goodbye. (Low chatter) Is there something troubling you? When I woke up this morning, you weren't there. I was with Medea. She was here? We have to leave now. If that witch was here, Pasiphae and her soldiers won't be far behind. No, Medea hasn't betrayed us. Oh, really? The last time you trusted her, the Queen ended up with a knife in her side. Look, she's not who you think she is. How can you say that, after all she's done? Because Medea has seen Pasiphae for who she really is, and she wants nothing more to do with her. Everything that comes out of her mouth is a lie! Why you can't see that is beyond me. Today is the solstice. Pasiphae will travel to the temple at Nemi. And when she does, she will enter alone. It may be our last chance to strike. I'm assuming Medea told you this? Yes. Even the blindest and most stupid of stupid blind men could tell this is a trap! Well, I trust her. Why would you trust someone who nearly took my life? You don't know her like I do. The temple is a sacred place. Only those touched by the gods may enter. We cannot accompany you inside. Well, this may be our only chance. I have to face her, even if it is alone. The men are ready. What is it? It would be safer for you to remain in Atlantis. I'm required to pay homage. You would have me offend the gods? That was not my intention. If my general feels unable to protect me, perhaps it is time I found a new general. (Shouting) So, are you going to tell me what's wrong, or are we going to spend the entire journey in silence? There's nothing wrong. Really? You've barely said two words since we returned from Atlantis. It's Icarus, isn't it? I remember it well... the first time you feel that way about someone. You know nothing of my feelings. Hercules : She's brought a small army. This is as far as we go. You have the passionflower? I wish you didn't have to go in there alone. Just be ready for when I return. I must continue alone. Form a perimeter around the temple. No-one is to enter. No-one. Aien eme dunamis kai emon kratos aiei d'hagnon huudor... hoti pantos panta kathairei. I pity you. Everyone you have ever loved has deserted you. Your husband. Your son. Your niece. You've spoken with Medea? She has come to see the darkness in your heart. She's confused. The child doesn't know her own mind. No. You don't know Medea as well as you think. Medea told me that I would find you here... alone. You are your father's son. That I accept. That is why this will be so much easier for me. Er' uun eis korakas...  (Gasps)  ... kai de kakon oiton oloio. (Blade rings) (Gasps) It seems your powers are failing you. (She gasps) Whispers : You cannot kill me. You're right. I can't. But there are many who can. Alive or dead? Alive. Just checking. Find them! I never believed I'd see the day she'd be at our mercy. Goran : Hundreds of men are searching the forest. They have found no trace of Pasiphae. We must consider the possibility that she's already dead. You would have me call off the search? If I were you, I would not be so eager to find the Queen alive. I should have you executed as a traitor. Really? If Pasiphae is returned to the throne, who do you think she'll blame for her abduction? You were responsible for her protection. She'll mount your head on a stick. Perhaps we should look to the future. I am a soldier. I will leave such matters to you. (Sniffs) I suppose you've come to gloat? Not entirely. (Groans) Drink it. (Chokes) Drink! Swallow. Swallow it! (Gulps and groans) Ariadne? Do you love him? Jason -- do you love him? More than you could possibly understand. Such a shame he's been unfaithful to you. What do you mean? He hasn't spoken to you about his feelings for Medea, my niece? He has no feelings for her. Oh, I think you know that isn't true. They've become close. Intimate. I don't believe you. Jason wouldn't do that. Why else would Medea betray me for him... if not for love? You couldn't possibly understand the bond between them. I pity you, Ariadne. Save your pity for yourself. I must ask something of you. You don't have to ask. Just know that you are doing the right thing. (Blade scrapes) (Gasps) Give me a moment. It's over. You stupid boy. It'll never be over. I know. You will never relinquish your claim to the throne. (Sighs) You've finally come to understand me. That's why I've come to say goodbye. No. No, Jason, I'm your mother. There's nothing that shames me more than that. No, you are my kin. My blood runs through your veins. That's all we have in common. No, there's no place for you in this world. No. The gods will never allow it. It is forbidden. You don't serve the gods. You only serve yourself. Jason... Please... please... don't do this. There is a part of me that will always love you. I don't deny that. But all you know is hate. Maybe in death, you'll find peace. Jason, if you do this, you will never forgive yourself. You will regret it for the rest of your life. I know. I hope you find peace with your goddess. Jason! No! Please... Jason! Jason! Don't do this! Please! I am your mother! 
 
 (Birds tweet) (Crow caws) (Crow caws) On your knees. (Sobs) Jason will never forgive you. That's a chance I'll have to take. I'll make it swift, which is more than you deserve. Please. Let me make peace with my goddess. Please. Nuun de se proskaleo, dnopheron genos ennuukhiaon... Kill her while she prays, and we risk angering Poseidon. We must let her finish. ... genos ennuukhiaon. She is asking her goddess for resurrection. Kai gar ego... She will rot in Tartarus with the rest of her kind. ... malake kaleus... tende thean... empsuukhon hapanton... s'epikuron... pelason. (Sniffs) (She breathes hard) (Gasps) (Breathes hard) (Blade slashes) It's done. Once it is known, I believe that the people will see me as their rightful heir. Hercules : You do not have the support of the army or the council. Without them, you won't take the throne. Ariadne : He's right. Cilix and his allies will oppose us. No doubt Cilix will try and take the throne for himself. Then we must kill him. How? He has an army protecting him in Atlantis. We have 20 men. We need to lure him from the city. We send a message. We tell him we wish to sue for peace. Cilix will never fall for it. He'll know it's a trap. No doubt Cilix will suspect it. We must mislead him. How do you propose we do that? Cilix will seek to find out if the offer is genuine. The only way he can do this is through the person who has been betraying us these past weeks. Jason : What are you talking about? Icarus. He is a traitor. No, he wouldn't do that. As much as it saddens me, it's true. Perhaps now we can use his betrayal to our advantage. Oh, you scared me. What is it? It's good to see you. How are Jason and the Queen? They are well, considering they are living as fugitives in the forest. I sometimes think Ariadne likes the simplicity of it. I cannot say the same for myself or Hercules. We miss our beds... and our friends. The city is rife with rumours. It's difficult to know what to believe. What are these rumours? Some say that Pasiphae is dead. Then it's true? Yes. I did not think I would ever see the day. What will happen now? That is to be seen. I heard talk that Jason and the Queen wish to negotiate peace? It seems we may be returning to the city much sooner than any of us dared hope. They would really make peace with Cilix and the council, after all that has happened? There's been enough bloodshed. Jason will do whatever it takes to end it. The offer is genuine. That is welcome news. Perhaps the end is in sight. I actually believe it might be. I must leave soon, if I'm to return to the city before the curfew. I will walk some of the way with you. Let us hope that soon you will be able to return with me. The gods willing. Take care, my friend. And you. The bait is laid. Let us hope they take it. Goran : So, it is true? Pasiphae is dead? That's what he said. Cilix : You're certain? And what of Jason's desire for peace? If we meet him, might we not be walking ourselves into an ambush? No, the offer is genuine. He is ready to negotiate. He wants the bloodshed to end. Please. I have done all that you have asked. I'm begging you... release my father. It will be done. Wait outside. Is that wise? He may be of further use to us. I gave him my word. What do you intend to do? Men like us spend our lives serving kings and queens. Perhaps it is time we served our own interests. You mean to take the throne? You have no claim to it. Whoever has the support of the army may claim what they like. You think Jason and Ariadne will just stand aside? Of course not. That's why we must kill them. What better opportunity than when we meet to negotiate peace? You're being released. I'm taking you home. At what cost? All that I did, it was for you. No. I didn't ask you to do it. Do not seek my forgiveness. I cannot give it. Please, Father. I have nothing more to say to you. Hate me if you will. I'm taking you home nonetheless. (Metal creaks) Your men found nothing suspicious? All is as it seems. Then it appears your informant was right. It will all be over soon enough. (Footsteps approach) (Blade rings) I received your message. I understand you wish negotiate peace? I'm sure that is what we all desire. Ultimately, yes. But I'm afraid you won't live to see it. Now! Cilix : Now! Now! The men who were sent to kill us are all dead. Kill them! Lower your swords! Stand down! (Blades ring) It seems your power is slipping away, Cilix. Oh, Your Majesty... You must see that all I did was in the interests of the city and its people. The only person you care for is yourself. You will need me in the times ahead. I... I can be useful to you. Please. I'm begging you. It'll be the last thing you do. Please... No! (Thud) I have seen too many men die. The bloodshed must end. We are in agreement. Atlantis must be ruled by consent, not brutality. Then you have my support. The army will not oppose us? Not while I command it. All I ask is that there are no reprisals against my men. I will not see them punished for following orders. Those that swear loyalty will be spared. Those that cannot are free to leave the city, never to return. You have my word. You should return to Atlantis. I will tell the high priest to make preparations. Once you have the blessing of the gods, no-one will dare oppose you. And how do I know I can trust you? You have my word... as I have yours. It seems we will have to trust each other, if this is to end. We will return to Atlantis. Jason. You don't trust him? Goran. Are we really to believe he'll let us stroll back into Atlantis? Jason trusts him. Jason thinks everyone's as honourable as he is. Perhaps no-one's completely honourable. I suppose we have no choice. We have to put our faith in him. Ariadne : I'd started to doubt I would ever return. You must prepare yourself. It's not the same city that you left. I know. (Baby cries) (Baby cries) (Woman screams) What I did was unforgivable. I am truly sorry. There must be forgiveness if there is to be peace. We should all strive to put the past behind us. I will serve you in any way I can. Every man has sworn an oath of loyalty. This is your army now. Next time we meet, you'll be King. Thank you for all you've done. I won't forget it. The preparations have been made. At dawn tomorrow, you will receive the gods' blessing. You will rule Atlantis as King and Queen. Thank you, Melas. (Screeches) (Dragon screeches) (Screeches) (Screeches) Ariadne? What's wrong? Ariadne : Being here again. It no longer feels like my home. After everything that's happened, it was always going to feel strange, but we've retaken the city with hardly a drop of blood being shed. I know. It's... it's more than we could ever have hoped for. There is something troubling you, though? Tell me. It's Pasiphae. She said something to me. What? There is nothing that she would like more than to... to sow doubt in your mind. You... you can't believe anything that she said. You're right. Nothing should spoil this day. (Dragon screeches) (Screeches) (Screeches) (Dragon screeches) (Screeches) Well, for once, that was easier than I thought it was going to be. We should celebrate. We have beds and food and fine wine. (Sniffs) Lots and lots of fine wine. Burying your head in a wineskin is your answer to everything. It solves nothing. Nothing. What's got into you? Pythagoras? Where are you going? There's something I must do. (Sighs) (Sniffs) Pythagoras? What are you doing here? We have returned to the city. What do you mean? Cilix is dead. The army have pledged allegiance to Jason and Ariadne. At dawn tomorrow, they will be blessed by the gods... and they will take the throne. Then it's over? Apparently so. Oh, this... this is better news than we could ever have hoped for. Surely this is cause for celebration? I can take no joy in it. Why not? What happened to your father? What happened to him? He was arrested for helping you retrieve Pandora's box. They beat him and tortured him. He was close to death. That is why you betrayed us. You knew? (Icarus gasps) How? When? When we were ambushed in the arena. You were the only person who could have revealed our plan. You knew when we met at the hunting lodge? (Icarus breathes hard) We assumed whatever I told you would find its way back to Cilix. We used you to set a trap for him. Pythagoras. You betrayed me. My father was close to death. They said if I helped them, they would release him. I didn't want to do it. But I couldn't just watch my father die. You would have seen others die in his place? Jason, Hercules, Ariadne. Your betrayal nearly cost their lives. I'm sorry. You would have seen me die? I mean nothing to you. You mean... everything to me. You cannot say that. I had no choice. There is always a choice. I understand... the reasons why you did it... but I will never forgive you. Please. Pythagoras. Please. I... I'm sorry. I... I couldn't bear the thought of losing you. I had to do it. But I will hate myself forever. You poor boy. Pythagoras will never forgive me. Daedalus : I'm afraid that may be true. (Icarus sobs) Oh. Sorry. I didn't mean to startle you. Don't get up. I was just enjoying the night air. And some wine. Is everything all right? Where's Jason? He's sleeping. That boy is a constant source of worry for me. You're a good friend to him. (Sighs) I don't know about that. I do my best. Hm. Sometimes I wish I had friends like you and Pythagoras. Someone I could talk to. I know it's not my place to ask, but is everything all right? I cannot sleep. You've a big day ahead of you tomorrow. You're bound to be nervous. It isn't nerves. What is it? Jason. The way he was when his heart blackened. I fear the memory of it will haunt us forever. Those were troubling times, but Jason's put it all behind him now. Has he? Why do you say that? Because Pasiphae said him and Medea had become intimate. No. He... he wouldn't. She told me he was unfaithful to me. That witch would have done anything to tear you apart. Lies, all lies. I know I shouldn't believe her. But when Jason talks of Medea, I know he is hiding something. I see it in his face. They have a bond I can never understand. But it's you he married. It's you he loves. If it is true, I'm not sure I can forgive him. Tomorrow you will receive the blessing of the gods. A new dawn. You must put these thoughts from your mind. I'm not sure I can. Something has changed in him, and it will never be the same. (Dragon screeches) (Screeches) With me. (Door creaks) Goran. How good of you to join me. How can this be? I believed you to be dead. Pasiphae : I was. For a brief time. But now I am returned. The throne is no longer yours. And you think that is your decision to make? Seize her! I gave you an order! Seize her! It seems you face a choice. Loyalty. It's such a fickle notion. I cannot stand by any longer. How many more men will you see die to satisfy your lust for power? As many as it takes. Those of you who swear allegiance to me shall live. You have my word. I will never kneel before you, Pasiphae. Hormei khiliadon andron mune soi epeimi. (He groans) It seems you are mistaken. (Groans) And those of you who defy me... shall die with their general. (Snap) Your Majesty. The palace guard have agreed to side with Pasiphae. We strike before the gods give their blessing. You look beautiful. Ready? Yes. You are ready to receive the blessing of the gods? We are. Cassandra : Ennosigaie pater... theiois en domasi tutois. Ennosigaie pater, theiois en domasi tutois. O gaieokhe su deomesth' oiktiremen hemon, phrena kai kata thuumon. O gaieokhe su deomesth' oiktiremen hemon... sebomen se kata phrena kai kata thuumon. Ennosigaie pater theiois... (Speaks prayer) O gaieokhe su deomesth' oiktiremen hemon. (Speaks prayer) (Speaks prayer shouting outside) (Shouting outside speaks prayer) (Shouts and screams) Here. Jason! They would defile the temple? I will not allow it. Melas, no. Put down your swords. Melas : You. You dare violate this sacred place? No! Run. Jason : Come with us. Jason! We won't escape the city in daylight. We need to find a place to hide. Move it! Move it! (Soldier shouts) I don't think anyone saw us. You're bleeding? It's nothing. (Soldiers run outside) Send every soldier we have. Tear this city apart! I want them found! I killed her. I swear to you. Pasiphae was dead. (Shouts outside) We wait here until nightfall. And then? We try to escape the city. Are you hurt? Melas always cared for me. I'm sorry. I know he betrayed you. He was trying to protect me. He was a good man. I know. (People shout and scream) Search every house and every store! Icarus : Father! Father! What? What's happening? Pasiphae has retaken the city. Will that woman never stop? There are rumours that Jason and Queen Ariadne have escaped into the lower town. Soldiers are everywhere, tearing it apart. And Pythagoras? I don't know. I presume he's with them. I have to help him. No, no, no! You'll be cut down before you can get anywhere near them. After all that I have done, I have to do something. Don't try and stop me. Stop you? You foolish boy. I'm going to help you. Have they been found? Not yet, but the city's sealed. There's no escape. Let it be known that anyone sheltering them shall be hung up in the streets. Let's see just how quickly they turn against their new king. (Soldiers shout) (Soldiers march) Are you sure this is going to work? In life, the only thing you can be truly certain of is death. Is that supposed to make me feel better? I could tell you that I'm completely confident of success, if that would help. (Soldiers shout) I don't think we're going to escape this. At least we are together. (Soldiers shout nearby) If this is the end, there's something I must know. Medea. What happened between you two? In the dark times... there was a moment between us. It's over now. Medea has returned to Colchis. I'm never going to see her again. (Soldiers shout nearby) There's soldiers everywhere. How many? Too many to fight. No! They're coming this way. (Hammering on door) (Hammering on door) (Footsteps depart outside) (Hammering at door) Daedalus : Ready? Not really. Remember that the wings are sealed with wax, and if the sun is too hot, the wax will melt and you will plummet to the ground and almost certainly die. It is night. There is no sun. Mm-hm. All right, you should be fine. But remember, don't flap. Glide. Glide and soar like an eagle. An eagle? (Breathes hard) Well, go on. Go on, then. Aagh! No! Don't flap! Don't flap! Aagh! Oh! Ah! Oh! My son! Ah! He's flying. Any bright ideas? (Hammering at door) (Crashing) Right. See you in Hades. What was that? Fire powder. (Soldiers shout) What in the name of the gods was that? Icarus. It's Icarus. He's flying? It would appear so. Come on! (Soldiers shout) Let's keep moving. Icarus! (He groans) Pythagoras! No! (Crashing) Icarus? (Gasps) (Sobs) No... Icarus! I'm sorry. (Hercules clears throat) If you've quite finished, we have to flee the city. (Crows caw) (Birds sing) (Snores) Cassandra : O thanate, psuukhas tautas nuun pempe thanonton teele pros oluusion pedion kai peirata gaios. I was praying for Melas. There has been so much bloodshed. Will we ever be free of Pasiphae? It will be difficult... but not impossible. Pasiphae will only be vanquished... if you find the source of her power and destroy it. What is the source of her power? There is a golden fleece, woven long ago by the Stygian witches. No mortal man has ever seen it. The power it has is... unimaginable. Where can I find it? In Colchis. You will need great courage... and huge sacrifice. Even then, you will not succeed alone. There's only one person who can help you. Who? You already know the answer to that question. Medea. Hercules : Not Colchis. Anywhere but Colchis. That's where it is. It is the land of witches and dark magic. The stories I've heard. It's the stuff of nightmares. I hate to say it, but a man should know when he's beaten. You... you did everything you could. Jason : I don't have a choice. There will never be peace until Pasiphae is defeated. When I came here, the Oracle told me it was my destiny to save the city. And as much as I want to, I... I can't forget that. I know. Pasiphae will only be defeated when I destroy the source of her power. That's why I have to go away. Where? Colchis. It's the only way. Then I will go with you. No. It's too dangerous. I have to go alone. Then who is to protect you from yourself? If Pasiphae is to be defeated, then we'll do it together. (People shout and scream) (Woman screams) (Seagulls cry) We won't make the harbour by nightfall. We should set up camp. (She mutters quietly) (She whispers) (Thunder crashes) Cassandra : He's coming. He's coming. He's coming.
