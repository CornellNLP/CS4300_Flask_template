 It's Medusa, isn't it? Tell me. Tell me it isn't her. 
 (Eerie hissing) 
 She took her life to save Atlantis. 
 (Sobs) 
 How did you get in here? 
 I can't explain. We need to move fast. 
 You will not kill me... because I am your mother. 
 Medusa... aideomai se kai eukhomene kharin iskho. 
 Medusa... 
 We have to go. 
 What is it? 
 A patrol. 
 An Atlantean patrol. 
 How many? 
 Too many. 
 Are you going to help? 
 No. 
 You flee if you want to. 
 What are you doing? 
 What we should have done ages ago. 
 This is madness. 
 Then stay here! 
 Always the hero. 
 Jason... 
 Jason! 
 He cannot go alone. 
 He will be killed. 
 We can't give up on him now. 
 Give up on him?! We've risked everything for that boy. 
 And in return... 
 No. He's made it quite clear he's happy on his own, and that's fine by me. 
 Hey! I thought I'd save you the journey. 
 (Yelling) 
 (Yells) 
 Please... 
 My Queen. 
 Ariadne. 
 He's unarmed. 
 I wanted no part of this. 
 Stand down. 
 It is you I wish to serve. 
 Come, we will not harm you. 
 What are you doing? 
 (Dull thud) 
 (Chokes and splutters) 
 He was a defenceless boy! 
 He tried to kill us. 
 I told you to stand down. 
 And who are you to give me orders? 
 (Crow caws) 
 You're wasting your time. They're gone. 
 Is this true? 
 They're all dead. 
 Well, well... What a hero you are! 
 How many more dead to add to your tally? 
 Someone had to protect us. 
 Protect us? And what'll happen when they find the bodies, eh? 
 You don't think they'll come looking for us? 
 All you've achieved is to rob a lot of mothers of their sons and to tell Pasiphae exactly where we are. 
 This is no time for fighting. 
 But he doesn't know any other way, does he? 
 It's not like he could use his brain... 
 Jason! 
 ..because he doesn't have one. 
 That's right. Fall back on what you know. 
 Here... Why don't you take my head as well? 
 Jason... 
 No. 
 It might not be as pretty. 
 Or useful. 
 No, no! 
 I need to look at it. 
 We need to move out! Which is what we should have done all along! 
 The patrol have not returned. 
 What does that mean? 
 I do not know. 
 They are lost? Dead? 
 Possibly. 
 But Jason is not. 
 He could be over the border by now. How did we let this happen? 
 All will be well. 
 For who? 
 Jason knows I am his mother. He knows he is the rightful heir to the throne. 
 He also knows that he is touched by the gods. 
 He's drawn to us. I've seen it with my own eyes. 
 Perhaps. 
 I remember when I first became aware of my powers. I was so frightened. 
 I could feel the darkness around me. 
 I remember that, too. 
 That's how Jason feels right now. 
 He will come to us. 
 Oh, I wish I had your faith. 
 You will see. 
 No, we cannot rely on Jason to change allegiance. 
 Given time, though... 
 My orders remain the same. 
 We must find him, we must kill him. 
 We'll need to hunt tomorrow. 
 Do you think we'll be safe here? 
 Is this how it's going to be? 
 I didn't ask for your company. 
 Not now. 
 And not earlier. 
 Because you could have defeated them alone? 
 Because I am sick of taking orders. 
 I assure you it will be my last. 
 (She sighs) 
 I have never seen you as someone to order around. You know that. 
 I have also never seen you as a cold-hearted killer. 
 What you have learned about Pasiphae... 
 It must have been a great shock. 
 But you cannot let it change who you are. 
 The Jason I know and love... 
 I don't want any company. 
 SIGHS He does not deserve to be loved. 
 I'm sorry. 
 There. You will live. 
 What's the point? 
 I would rather join Medusa than endure this any longer. 
 Don't say that. 
 She died for this. 
 For this?! 
 She sacrificed her own life so we might live in peace. What good did it do? 
 It is hard to tell at the moment. 
 Pasiphae is still on the throne, Atlantis lies in ruin, and we're fugitives, stuck in a forest with no food, no medicine. 
 Just a stark raving lunatic for company. 
 It is as the Oracle foretold. 
 Now that Jason knows the truth about his mother... his heart is blackened. 
 Then there's nothing we can do. 
 He is lost to us for ever. 
 I cannot believe that. 
 (Restless breathing) 
 (Crow caws) 
 (Cawing) 
 (Flurry of wings) 
 (Crow screeches) 
 It's all right. You're all right. It was just a dream. 
 I fail to see how this news is supposed to please me. 
 Who else would be using makeshift arrows to defend themselves? 
 Who else would be hiding out in the forest like fugitives? We are close, my Queen. 
 But not close enough! 
 Dispatch a patrol. 
 It is already done. 
 (Door unlocked) 
 (Door creaks open) 
 I never thought I'd see Jason attack his friends. 
 He is not the Jason we know. 
 We mustn't forget that. 
 He was the Jason we know when he killed Medusa. 
 I know how you feel about him right now, but you must remember what the Oracle said. 
 Jason is the only person who can save Atlantis. 
 I'm going to find Melas. 
 If anyone knows how to help Jason, Melas surely will. 
 If they find you... 
 They won't. 
 I still have friends in the city. 
 What makes you think Melas'll help? 
 Melas does not want to see Atlantis fall any more than you or I. 
 He could have turned me in when I took Pandora's Box, but he didn't. 
 I hope you're right. 
 We have to try something... for Medusa's sake, if nothing else. 
 (Both sigh) 
 We don't have long. The guards patrol every corner of the city. 
 What news of Daedalus? 
 He's suffering from a fever. 
 He'll be fine. 
 He has probably invented a cure by now. 
 I am sorry to come to you like this. 
 My friend... you have seen the way we live. 
 I will do all I can to help. 
 They're still enforcing the curfew. We cannot move around the city after dark. 
 What do you suggest? 
 I have a friend... 
 A very useful friend. 
 Someone we can trust? 
 Someone who may be... persuaded to stay silent. 
 So, what does this friend do? 
 What makes him immune to the curfew? 
 Nobody stops me. 
 Even Pasiphae wants her city to smell nice. 
 I'd be happy to help you. 
 You know if we're caught, Pasiphae will likely have us killed. 
 Better make sure you're nicely covered, then, hadn't we? 
 I'll take you as far as I can. 
 Keep your heads down. 
 Halt! 
 Beautiful night for it. Did you ever see such a moon? 
 Where are you headed? 
 Wherever the horses have been. 
 Which, I don't mind telling you, is pretty much everywhere. 
 Under whose authority? 
 Why, the Queen. 
 Tell me, where do you live? 
 For a small consideration, I'll give it an extra-special clean! 
 (Burps) 
 All right, be on your way. 
 I had hoped Pythagoras would be back by now. 
 Don't worry about him. He is more skilled than he looks. 
 You are thinking of Medusa? 
 When I think about her sacrifice... 
 Medusa's death may rest heavy on your shoulders... but the fault does not lay with you. 
 It pains me to see the two of you at odds. 
 We must not allow ourselves to be consumed with anger. 
 If we turn against one another, then Pasiphae has won. 
 Indeed. 
 She has won. 
 Good luck to her. 
 May her power bring her much happiness... 
 This is it. This is as far as I go. 
 Halt! 
 Beautiful evening for it. 
 Huh... 
 The streets are quiet, the stars are out. 
 Missed a spot. 
 Oh... 
 Keep up the good work. 
 Hey! 
 (Sword unsheathed) 
 Thank you, my friend. 
 You will return. 
 I will return. 
 Do not fear. 
 Until later. 
 May the gods be with you. 
 (Footsteps) 
 Why are you here? 
 I am here because of Jason. 
 You have seen how the people live - amongst rotting corpses, with barely enough food to survive. 
 Jason is the only one who can help them, but Jason is no longer the man we knew. 
 He knows the truth about Pasiphae? 
 His heart has blackened. 
 It is as the Oracle foretold. 
 Those who are touched by the gods are drawn to one another by forces they cannot control. 
 I fear for him. I fear for all of us. 
 If he were to join Pasiphae... 
 There must be a way to help him. 
 (Eerie echoing) 
 Nun dunamin dos emoi mekhri peusomai hatta genoito. 
 What is it? What did you see? Is there a way? 
 The gods have spoken. 
 I feel Jason's pain. 
 He stands on a threshold. 
 On one side is the light of the life he has known, and on the other is the darkness that draws him to Pasiphae. 
 The lure of that darkness is strong. 
 I refuse to believe that. 
 Peace, my friend. Be still and listen. 
 But no force can thrive without its opposite. 
 You must find that opposite. 
 I don't understand. 
 The mother's love that would draw him to darkness is but the mirror of the father's that would make it whole again. 
 Jason's father is dead. 
 He alone can draw Jason back into the light. 
 That's impossible. 
 He is your only hope. 
 
 
 
 (Sobs) 
 He's dead. The Oracle told Jason so. 
 It is true, that is what she said. His father walks amongst the dead. 
 The Oracle cannot lie about what she has seen. 
 There are those who suffer the torments of death in life, who hide themselves away from the world. 
 He is alive? 
 I believe you have already met. 
 He is one of the unclean... for whom life is a curse. 
 He is a leper. 
 You will find him in the old silver mines of Pangeon. 
 In the Mountains of Galena. 
 Thank you. 
 May the gods look kindly on you for what you have done today. 
 Ariadne will not forget what you have done for us. 
 And neither will I. 
 This should last you to the silver mines. 
 What do you hope to find there? 
 Peace... for all of us. 
 Well, may we meet again in those times. 
 That is the thought I will carry with me. 
 (Marching footsteps) 
 (Door unlocks) 
 (Faint shouts and calls) 
 Father... 
 (Groans) 
 What happened? 
 Shh. 
 We... We had a slight disagreement. 
 His knowledge of even the most basic chemical compounds is pitiful. 
 I don't know how he's managed to live this long. 
 By not blowing things up. 
 Yes, well, I am very proud of that explosion. 
 Well, I'm glad about that, because you're going to hang for it. 
 Hmm. Well, maybe at the last moment I'll discover how to make myself invisible. 
 The date is set. 
 Sunrise tomorrow. 
 Be strong, my son. 
 I can change this. 
 No. 
 There are some things we must accept. 
 This is not one of them. 
 Where are you going? 
 All will be well. 
 I promise. 
 Icarus! 
 (Door clangs faintly) 
 This had better be good. I am not interested in a tale of a tavern brawl. 
 My father is due to be executed tomorrow. 
 You disturbed me to tell me this? 
 I beg you to rethink. 
 Take him away! 
 No, you don't understand. 
 I am not interested in your pleas. 
 I have news. 
 Of Ariadne. 
 What news? 
 You will not hang my father? 
 I will not hang your father. 
 She hides in the woods. 
 This I know. 
 Her followers are headed towards the silver mines at Pangeon... with some urgency. 
 What do they hope to find there? 
 I do not know. 
 You have done well. 
 You will free my father. 
 No. 
 I will not hang your father. I said nothing of freeing him. 
 Why would I do that... when you bring me such useful information? 
 Aeson? 
 (Clattering) 
 Aeson? 
 Aeson, I need to speak to you. 
 I have news of Jason. 
 Who are you? 
 It's Pythagoras. 
 I need your help. 
 Aeson... 
 I trust this news pleases you. 
 Send men to the Valley of Iria. Pythagoras must return that way. 
 Follow him. He will certainly lead us to Jason. 
 What is it? 
 Nothing. 
 We draw closer. 
 Indeed. 
 He is finally within our sights. 
 I'm a fool. 
 That woman makes me a fool. 
 Even after all that she has done I trusted her with this. 
 I trusted she would not tell him. 
 It was to her advantage. 
 How so? 
 Jason was about to kill her. 
 If only he had, for now he is lost to all of us. 
 His heart has blackened. 
 Where once there was compassion, now there is just anger. 
 Anger and hatred. 
 Those who are touched by the gods carry the darkness within them. 
 We need your help. 
 I thank you for your belief in me but I fear it is misplaced. 
 I cannot do what you ask. 
 You're the only one who can save him. 
 (Sighs) 
 All this endless fighting leaves me weary. 
 Power passes from hand to hand, but nothing changes. 
 I fear that without you, Jason cannot resist Pasiphae. 
 We must believe that good will triumph. 
 Were he himself, that might be true. 
 Look at the life he has lived, all that he has accomplished without me. 
 Jason believes his father to be dead. I am dead to him. That is the best way. 
 How can that be so? 
 In another life Jason had a father... a father who protected him, who he could be proud of. 
 Look at me! 
 I am not that man. 
 Would that I were... 
 Would that I could have my life again. 
 It is anticipated that the boy will lead us to Ariadne and Jason. 
 As soon as you have Pythagoras in sight, dispatch a messenger without delay. 
 It's a shame Pythagoras is missing this! 
 It was a fool's mission. He's probably dead. 
 You can give him my share, should he return. 
 Pythagoras is not dead. I would know if he were. 
 In here. 
 How long have you two been friends? 
 Long enough to forget how long, and believe it to be for ever. 
 What Jason did to you... he did it for me, to save me. 
 He thought he was doing the right thing. 
 Jason always thinks he's doing the right thing. 
 And Medusa, she... she knew... 
 Oh, yeah... she knew. 
 She knew what she was doing. 
 And believe me, I'm just as angry with her. 
 Don't let her death be in vain. 
 Don't let it destroy those who are still living. 
 Talk to him. 
 Maybe you can find a way through. 
 What will you do? 
 I don't know. 
 Return to my friends. 
 I'll do what I can. 
 And I have not done what I can? 
 Well, no, you haven't. 
 You are the one person who can help. Jason needs you. 
 For the first time ever, he really needs you, and you... 
 You are deserting him. 
 I am not deserting him. 
 The Jason I first met, the Jason I have journeyed with these past years, is a person I admire with all my heart. 
 The kind of person I would like to be. 
 He is brave. 
 He is loyal. 
 He is nothing like you. 
 Do not look so afraid. 
 I mean you no harm. 
 There's no more to say. 
 In that case, we will walk in silence. 
 I do not wish to fight with you. 
 Whatever has happened, we should not be turning knives on each other. 
 I cannot deny my anger. 
 Then don't. 
 But it was wrong of me to take it out on you. 
 I understand. 
 After all... I killed her. 
 S-She agreed to it? 
 Mmm. 
 She agreed. 
 There was no struggle. 
 Was there not another way? Any other way? 
 I loved her. 
 And I'm sure... that she loved you. 
 But she's gone now. 
 Life moves on. 
 Where are they camped? 
 The far side of the valley. 
 We will be there by nightfall. 
 'You have found Pythagoras?' 
 As you predicted, he is not alone. 
 I will ride with you. Saddle the horses. 
 What are you doing? 
 I cannot remain. I'm sorry. 
 I tried, but I cannot be with him. 
 We have to stay together. 
 You are welcome to come. 
 The forest is swarming with soldiers. 
 If I stay, nothing will end well. 
 I cannot look after him alone. 
 Pythagoras will return. 
 Hercules, please. 
 I cannot. 
 In my head, I know he is not himself, but I don't have the strength to stop my gut, and my gut just wants to kill him. 
 I'm sorry it has come to this. 
 We move camp every couple of days. 
 This is Hercules's way of telling me exactly where they're headed. 
 Do not worry. I know where they are. 
 I do not doubt your skill. 
 I am more concerned with my own. 
 What am I going to say to him? What if he doesn't want to know me at all? 
 He's back. 
 Pythagoras is back. 
 Who's that he's with? 
 (Soldier yells) 
 (Yells) 
 Eith' Hekate doie menos ifthimon ede moi alken. 
 (Pants) 
 Shh. 
 Where's Jason? 
 Jason was badly injured. There is no way that he could survive. 
 We will find him. I will bring you his body. 
 Victory is within sight, my Lady. 
 Gaia thea, phainu - dunamin gar emoi. 
 Victory? 
 (Gasps) 
 Do not speak to me... of victory. 
 (Pants) 
 Tende thean kaleus hemon empsukhon hapanton. 
 (Groans) 
 What happened? 
 Shh. 
 You must rest. 
 Sleep can help you more than I. 
 Should I be sleeping with one eye open? 
 Look... 
 There's someone moving over there. 
 Pythagoras! 
 Pythagoras! 
 It's so good to see you. 
 I thought you were dead. 
 Where's Jason? 
 Who is this? 
 You need not be afraid. 
 You brought Pasiphae here. 
 No. 
 No, I promise you, my hatred for Pasiphae runs deeper even than yours. 
 I find that hard to believe. 
 It is true. 
 He is Jason's father. 
 How are you feeling? 
 Better. 
 Much better, thank you. 
 Why are you helping me? 
 We are all drawn together, those of us who are touched by the gods. 
 That's why I can sense you in my dreams? 
 We are more alike than you know. 
 (Flurry of wings) 
 We should not linger here. 
 Then where do you suggest we go? 
 Back to my mother? 
 She wants you dead. 
 What about you? 
 How... 
 How do I know that you won't just turn me in? 
 You do not. 
 In his hour of need I deserted him. 
 I failed Medusa and now I've failed Jason. 
 As long as there is a chance that Jason is still alive, we must do everything in our power to save him. 
 (Cheering and applause) 
 Jason... 
 Guards!
