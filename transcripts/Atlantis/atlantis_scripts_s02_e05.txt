 Orpheus may be blind but he sees more than any man I've ever known. 
 They're headed for the mountains. 
 We should catch them by nightfall. 
 Get the others out of here. I'll try and hold them off. 
 What is this place? 
 You no longer need me. 
 Nooooo! 
 Jason! 
 O psukhai khthoniai, deomai tethnkotas andras humon proskaleein, tous oulomenous ge makhetas na prascuto. 
 Do you think he survived the fall? I'm certain he survived. 
 We can only hope. It's too steep to climb. 
 We'll have to find another way down. 
 Is there any sign of him? 
 None. I'm sorry. 
 The boy has survived worse. We'll find him. 
 I refuse to believe he's dead. 
 Because it is unthinkable. We will do all we can to help. 
 Thank you. 
 Ah! 
 What is it? 
 I heard something. 
 I hear nothing. 
 When you lose one sense, others grow sharper. 
 Perhaps it was Jason? 
 Or perhaps it's something else. 
 Bats? 
 When is it ever bats? 
 [ A DISTANT BANGING ] 
 I heard it. 
 Jason must have managed to climb up. 
 [ A DISTANT CLATTERING ] 
 Jason? 
 Jason? 
 That's not Jason. 
 Who's there? 
 It's Dion! 
 He was dead. How can that be? 
 This is a gift from the Gods! 
 Argh! 
 He bit me! 
 Dion? 
 What's happened to him? 
 Stay back! I have no desire to harm you. 
 What do I do? 
 Whatever that is, it's not the Dion we knew. Kill him. 
 Hercules! Kill him! 
 I'm trying! 
 Hercules, there's more of them! 
 Hurry! 
 Go! Go, go, go! 
 Go, run! Run, run! 
 What are those things? 
 Why won't they die? 
 If Dion is one of them, we must assume that they are the dead. 
 They have been brought back to life? 
 It is known as necromancy. 
 The others, they looked like soldiers. 
 Before he died, King Hipparchus ordered the slaughter of his entire army. 
 He wanted them buried with him so they could protect him in Hades. 
 And these soldiers have now risen from their tombs, all of them? 
 To break the sacred divide between the living and the dead requires great power. 
 Pasiphae. 
 Then she isn't dead. 
 We have to find a way to stop them. 
 I've tried. Trust me. 
 It's easier said than done. 
 Dion's first instinct was to bite you. 
 We must assume that they mean to kill us and feast on our flesh. 
 We must see to your wound. 
 It's nothing. 
 Hello? 
 Hercules, is that you? 
 That should stop the bleeding. 
 This is impossible! 
 It is dead? 
 Twice over. 
 It was the final strike that felled it. The heart. 
 It seems they can be killed by piercing the heart. 
 [ DISTANT SCREECHING ] 
 Never underestimate the value of scientific deduction. 
 Is that what I was doing? 
 Pythagoras! 
 [ APPROACHING SHRIEKS ] 
 Your Highness. 
 I think we lost them. What are those things? 
 I believe they are the dead. 
 You came back for me? 
 I nearly didn't. 
 We're enemies? 
 Yeah, well, I guess that makes me a fool. 
 Pasiphae has always taught me that my enemies would kill me as soon as look at me. 
 She's wrong. She's wrong about many things. 
 Your enemies are not like her. 
 Who is she to you? 
 She's my blood. 
 [ DISTANT SCREECHING ] 
 How can the dead have risen? 
 There's only one person who could have done this. 
 Pasiphae. 
 They're not going to be far behind us. 
 Are you coming, or are you just going to wait for them? 
 [ DISTANT SCREECHING ] 
 What are they? 
 They're tombs. 
 There's hundreds of them. 
 And inside each one there was a corpse that has now risen and means to feed on our flesh. 
 What is wrong with you? 
 Sorry. 
 Oh! 
 Diagoras? 
 I just need to sit for a moment. 
 I don't understand how the wound has become infected so quickly. 
 Can you treat it? 
 I don't know. It's like no infection I have ever seen before. 
 We must find a place to hold up. 
 Hercules. What about Jason? We have to find him. 
 Diagoras is too weak to continue. 
 I have to see to his wound. 
 We should shelter in a tomb, one of those higher up. 
 We'll be out of sight. There's only one entrance. 
 We can defend it. 
 Tombs are for the dead. 
 Well, if the dead have risen, then its previous inhabitant will no longer have use for it. 
 Ariadne, why do you risk your life for her? 
 She is my Queen. I swore an oath. 
 There's more to it than that. 
 There can't be. 
 You have affection for her, do you not? 
 Why are you loyal to Pasiphae? 
 Do you even know? 
 I have been shunned all my life. People fear me. 
 Because of your sorcery? 
 Pasiphae is the only person who has ever shown me kindness. 
 I didn't believe her capable of kindness. 
 You don't know her as I do. 
 She slaughters anyone who stands in her way. 
 You must see what she does is wrong? 
 She does what is necessary to take her rightful place on the throne. 
 And you've never questioned that? 
 I've never had cause to question it. 
 Well, perhaps it's time you did. 
 I've done all I can for now. 
 I know he would be grateful. 
 Did you know from the moment you saw Orpheus that you would be together? 
 I didn't even see him at first. I heard him sing. 
 Then I saw him. 
 I knew I'd changed forever. 
 It was the same with Jason. 
 I tried to pretend it wasn't so. 
 What if I never have the chance to tell him? 
 You will, I'm sure of it. 
 You should get some rest. Make yourself comfortable. 
 As comfortable as you can, in a tomb. 
 I can't stop thinking about Jason. 
 He's somewhere out there, among the dead. 
 I know. 
 I try to protect him the best I can but perhaps it is beyond me. 
 You are not to blame. 
 It is my decisions that cost Dion his life. 
 If Jason were to die because of me, I would never forgive myself. 
 Jason is faster and better with a sword than any man I have ever met. 
 If anything, those things should be afraid of him. 
 I will pray to the Gods that is true. 
 His fever's worsened. 
 You did everything you could. It's in the hands of the Gods now. 
 When did you last get some sleep? 
 I don't remember. I'm so tired I can barely think straight. 
 You should get some rest, while you have the chance. 
 If we're to get out of here alive, we need that big brain of yours. 
 What about you? 
 Sleeping is for women, and babies, and men like you. 
 Warriors like myself, we don't need sleep. 
 You sleep more than any man I have ever known. 
 Maybe that's what I want you to think? 
 Why? 
 Just shut up and go to sleep. 
 All the wounds are to the heart. 
 So, they can be killed. 
 My friends are still alive. Come on. 
 We need to find them. 
 My leg. I think it's broken! 
 Let me see. 
 I can't stand up. 
 The bone has snapped. 
 What are you doing? 
 Trust me. 
 [ SHE MUTTERS INCANTATION ] 
 Argh! 
 You healed me? 
 It seems you don't feel the same way about your enemies as Pasiphae does. 
 You were wrong about her. 
 She raised the dead, knowing you were in the necropolis. 
 Perhaps she thought I died in the fall. 
 She had no way of knowing that. 
 She didn't think to come looking for you. 
 She doesn't care about you. 
 Do not say that! 
 I have no-one else. 
 What? We need to find my friends. 
 Argh! 
 Diagoras? 
 By your right hand! 
 Orpheus! The knife! By your right hand! 
 Up a bit! There! 
 Hercules! 
 What?! What's going on!? 
 You fell asleep. 
 I may have nodded off momentarily. 
 What happened? 
 It seems if we are bitten, we become one of them. 
 Oh, no. 
 What is it? 
 Your arm. 
 Did he bite you? 
 I don't know. I fell. 
 May I? 
 Well? 
 It's a cut. It's just a cut. 
 Praise the Gods. 
 It seems sleep isn't just for women, and babies, and men like me. 
 Eurydice? Did you get hurt? 
 No. I'm fine. It was just a shock. 
 To see our friend change like that. 
 There was nothing left of the man we knew. 
 Do not be concerned for me. I'm fine. 
 At least we can resume our search for Jason. 
 I think we might be stuck here a while longer. 
 What will happen when we find your friends? 
 What do you mean? 
 You believe Ariadne will welcome me with open arms? 
 She will most likely order you to execute me on the spot. 
 What will you say if she does? You have sworn an oath. 
 I won't let any harm come to you. You have my word. 
 Why would you protect me? 
 You saved my life. 
 You believe that changes anything? 
 Do not think for one moment that I will betray Pasiphae. 
 Surely you have already betrayed her by saving my life? 
 Perhaps I did it just so you could protect me from the dead? 
 I don't believe that. 
 
 
 
 Eurydice? 
 You feel hot. 
 It's just the air in this tomb. 
 I may be blind, but I can hear it in your voice. 
 What? 
 Fear. You are afraid. 
 Of course I'm afraid. 
 Tell me. Tell me what it is. 
 You have a fever. 
 No, no, no, no. Please. Please, tell me it can't be that. 
 He bit me. 
 When? 
 Diagoras. 
 My arm. 
 No. It cannot be. 
 Eurydice doesn't seem herself. 
 How so? 
 I don't know. 
 We're trapped in a tomb, surrounded by the living dead. 
 Nobody is themselves. 
 It looks like we're heading in the right direction. 
 [ SCREECHING ] 
 We have to go back. 
 My friends are that way. 
 So are the dead. We have to go. 
 Give me your torch. Quick! 
 Now we cannot see. 
 Neither can they. 
 [ SHRIEKING ] 
 What if they can see in the dark? 
 Something's wrong. 
 Orpheus and Eurydice. They've been sitting there for ages. 
 They haven't said a word to each other. 
 That's marriage for you. 
 I once knew a couple, they didn't speak for a year. 
 When the wife was in my arms, she would not stop talking. 
 Orpheus? 
 I wondered if you might like some water. 
 I'm fine. Thank you. 
 Eurydice? 
 She's fine. She's resting. 
 Is everything all right? 
 Please, my friend. Please, just leave us alone. 
 If you tell me what's wrong, perhaps I can help? 
 No-one can help. 
 What is it? 
 Orpheus, please. 
 I expected that we would see out our last days together. 
 How long has she been like this? 
 You can do nothing for her. 
 Is she hurt? Let me examine her. 
 You could do nothing to help Diagoras. 
 She was bitten? 
 Her arm. 
 We wanted to have these last moments together. 
 I am truly sorry. I will give you a moment alone. 
 What is it? 
 It's Eurydice. 
 She's been bitten. 
 How long does she have? 
 If the wound is anything to go by, not long. 
 What do we do? 
 There's only one thing we can do. 
 No. 
 She will become one of them. 
 We cannot risk another one of us being bitten. 
 We have no choice. 
 You would kill her, in front of her husband, who loves her more than anything? 
 Look at them. 
 I'll do it. 
 We can't ask that of you. 
 I cannot expect my people to do things I am not prepared to do myself. 
 You must be sure to pierce the heart. 
 You have come to kill her? 
 If there were any other way, I... 
 She is everything to me. 
 She is my world. 
 I know. But soon she will no longer be the woman you love. 
 She will turn on you and she will kill you. 
 She would never forgive herself if she hurt you. 
 She wouldn't want it. 
 If anyone is to end her life, it will be me. 
 I'm sorry, my love. 
 This isn't the end. 
 Not even Hades can keep us apart. 
 I will come for you, Eurydice. 
 I promise. 
 So many tombs. We shouldn't linger here. 
 There. It has to be them. 
 How can you be sure? 
 The dead don't light fires. 
 I hope one day somebody loves me like that. 
 Somebody already does. 
 I mean, pretty girl like you. 
 You must be beating them off with a stick - Your Highness. 
 [ STONES CLATTER IN DISTANCE ] 
 Jason?! 
 I nearly took your head off, you fool! 
 I'm lucky you're so useless with a sword then. 
 I feared you were dead. 
 What's she doing here?! 
 She's with me. 
 What do you mean she's with you? 
 She's a witch of Colchis. 
 I mean you no harm. 
 I should cut you down where you stand. 
 Hercules. 
 Take her knife. 
 I promised I would protect her. 
 You should not be making promises to my enemies. 
 Well, I owe her my life. 
 Look, she could have left me to die. 
 I have seen good in her. 
 There is no good in her. 
 You're wrong. 
 Let me put an end to this. 
 No, I gave her my word that no harm would come to her. 
 I made no such promise. 
 She will kill us the first chance she gets. 
 I don't believe that. 
 There is little to be gained in sparing her. 
 I can't let you do this. 
 Your faith in people will get you killed. 
 I won't allow that to happen. Now, step aside. 
 If you kill me, you will not escape the necropolis. 
 Lies, to save your own skin. 
 I speak the truth. I know how to vanquish the dead. 
 We already know how to kill them. 
 You believe you can fight your way through thousands of them? 
 If we have to. 
 I know how to end the curse that raised them from their graves. 
 I do not want to die any more than you, but if we are to escape with our lives, you have to trust me. 
 Never. 
 It seems we have no choice. 
 Then tell us. How do we lift the curse? 
 We must return to the place it was cast. 
 I don't trust her. 
 It will take more than some dark hair and pretty eyes to fool me. 
 Really? Because usually that's all it takes. 
 We'll have to watch her like a bat. 
 Bats are blind. 
 We'll have to watch her like something with really good eyesight. 
 A hawk. 
 We will watch her like a hawk. 
 I can't tell you how sorry I am. 
 This is not the end. 
 Stand up. Put your hands behind your back. 
 What's going on? 
 I'm not going anywhere with her unless her hands are tied. 
 She won't be able to defend herself. 
 She also won't be able to plunge a knife into our backs. 
 If this is what it takes for your friends to feel safe, then so be it. 
 Jason. 
 What is it? 
 For a moment I thought I had lost you. 
 I couldn't bear it. 
 You don't need to worry about me. 
 I couldn't help myself. 
 For as long as I remember I have been told I am a Goddess on Earth. 
 The truth is, I'm no different to anyone else. 
 You're the Queen now. I have accepted that. 
 Why should you accept it? 
 Why should either of us? 
 I know I hurt you. I pushed you away. 
 I am so ashamed of how I behaved. 
 I was scared. 
 I have lived my whole life in fear. 
 In fear of how people might judge me. 
 I refuse to do so any longer. 
 What I mean to say is... 
 I have tried so hard to deny it. 
 Deny what? 
 From the moment I saw you, I knew what it meant to love someone with all my heart. 
 I have faced death. 
 But nothing scares me more than admitting that I love you. 
 Say something. 
 [ SCREECHING ] 
 Get behind me! 
 Come on. 
 Pasiphae fell further along. 
 We must assume that's where she cast the spell. 
 Now we will find out if you're telling the truth. 
 It is a binding spell. 
 There will be some ancient symbols, perhaps carved into stone. 
 You must find them and destroy them. 
 How can you be sure they exist? 
 Because the curse would not hold without them. 
 I have heard this to be true. 
 If you're lying, you won't live to regret it. 
 I have no reason to lie to you. 
 Wait here. 
 Jason. 
 Be careful. 
 I suppose I'm going to have to go with you, aren't I? 
 You could just tell everyone you came with me. 
 When have I ever done that? 
 Frequently. 
 Watch her. 
 Like a hawk. 
 Hold on! 
 What do you think I'm doing!? 
 This is the last time I let you talk me into anything like this. 
 I seriously doubt that. 
 Can you see anything? 
 I see dead soldiers. 
 Hercules! The tomb! 
 Hercules! 
 Hercules! 
 You care for Jason very much, do you not? 
 I am not about to share my feelings with you. 
 Jason? 
 The heroes have returned. 
 Did you do it? 
 Actually, it was me who tossed the stone off the edge of the cavern. 
 I'm just making sure everyone knows the true story. 
 Since when have you cared if a story is true? 
 Let me help you. 
 You believe me now? 
 I always believed you. Give me your hands. 
 It seems we are in your debt. 
 There's your bag. 
 Thank you. 
 Now, can we please get out of here? 
 Mind your footing. 
 Let her go! 
 Jason! 
 What are you doing? 
 What I intended all along. 
 No! 
 Ariadne?! 
 If she dies, I will never forgive myself. 
 Medea! I will find you and I will kill you!
