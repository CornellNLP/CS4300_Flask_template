 I shouldn't be doing this. 
 A man of my talents shouldn't be scavenging for food. 
 We're not scavenging, we're hunting. 
 With that? 
 What are you expecting to find, a mouse? 
 Maybe a small vole? 
 Someone has to gut the thing - you can hardly do that with your ridiculous stick. 
 It is not a stick, it's a spear. 
 And I'll have you know, with this very spear I have defeated... 
 Shhh! 
 (gurgling) 
 It's a baby. 
 We need to find the mother, she can't be far. 
 I don't think so. 
 Spread out - Hercules, you go that way, and Pythagoras, retrace our steps. 
 She won't be here. 
 What are you talking about? 
 The child has been exposed - it's been left here to die. 
 That's insane! 
 Why would someone do that? 
 There can be many reasons - the child could be too weak to survive. 
 It looks fine. 
 Or it could be born out of wedlock... 
 If we can't find the mother, we need to help. 
 No, we can't interfere! 
 This was the child's fate. 
 Well, maybe it was my fate to find it. 
 He's got a point. 
 Only a fool challenges the Gods. 
 (baby cries) 
 You see? They have spoken. 
 Nonsense - the poor thing's just hungry. 
 Join the club. Oh. 
 Here, see if you can calm it down. 
 Me? What do I know about babies? 
 You must have been one once, Pythagoras - think back. 
 This is ridiculous, we need to put it back. 
 (baby laughs) 
 He's a natural. 
 Maybe it's his fate. 
 Got to be. 
 We can't interfere... I've got to... 
 Oh... 
 This is not fair. 
 (baby laughs) 
 A whole morning hunting and all we come back with is one more mouth to feed. 
 There must be some food somewhere. 
 (baby laughs) 
 Is that you, Hercules? 
 What? Eegh! 
 No! 
 Definitely not one of yours? 
 Why does it always have to be me? 
 A question we ask ourselves every morning. 
 No, it could just as easily be either one of you two. 
 I don't think so. 
 Not me - I carried it all the back. 
 No, no, I-I told you, I know nothing about babies - 
 I'd just drop it or something. 
 Right. 
 Get me a bowl and some cloths. 
 (baby laughs) 
 That solves one mystery - it's definitely a boy. 
 Tell me when it's all over. 
 How could anyone abandon him? 
 He's perfect. 
 Hmmm. Apart from the funny foot. 
 It's just swollen, that's all. 
 (baby cries) 
 Now look what you've done. 
 Nothing to do with me - he's hungry. 
 And I know exactly how he feels. 
 Shhh, shhh. 
 You look exhausted. Medusa! 
 If you were going to buy food for a child, what would you buy? 
 Sardines or olives? 
 Depends. How old is the child? 
 About that old. 
 You're at the wrong stall. 
 Really? 
 Who was that? 
 King Laius of Thebes. 
 He's been the King's guest for a few weeks now. 
 You had a successful hunt, my Lord? 
 King Laius did - all the trophies are his. 
 I imagined that would be the case. 
 The Gods were generous. 
 Indeed. 
 The King is an accomplished hunter. 
 He is. 
 A pity he doesn't restrict his prowess to the hunting grounds. 
 King Laius is of royal blood - you will speak of him with respect. 
 I wonder how the Queen feels about his royal blood - she has barely looked at him all the time she's been here. 
 Have you not noticed? 
 She is young and shy - it takes time to grow into the role of Queen. 
 Do we really need all this stuff? 
 I mean, he is just a baby. 
 I assume you have swaddling clothes? 
 Yes. Of course. 
 Wait... what are swaddling clothes? 
 Just to be sure... 
 Poor thing - he'd probably stand more chance on the mountain than with you three. 
 Keep it down! 
 I've only just got him off. 
 Medusa?! 
 (I thought we were keeping it down.) 
 This is wonderful. 
 Sorry about the mess, these two boys, you know... 
 I'm the tidy one, actually! 
 Is this him? 
 Isn't he sweet! 
 Can you believe someone just abandoned him? 
 I couldn't leave a baby out on the side of a mountain, now, could I? 
 You brought him back? 
 Carried him all the way home. 
 (baby laughs) 
 I bought some goat's milk. 
 Fill that up. 
 (baby cries) 
 There was nothing on him? 
 No note, no jewellery to pay his way? 
 Nothing. Whoever left him clearly didn't want to be found. 
 Here. 
 Oh, he must be starving. 
 That's why I sent Jason out - I knew the little fellow would need something to eat. 
 You're such a kind-hearted man, Hercules. 
 Maybe we should go back to where we found him. 
 Excellent idea. 
 Why don't you take Pythagoras, see what you can dig up? 
 While you stay here with the food? 
 Like you said, I'm good with babies. You're not. 
 It's just the way we are. 
 He's drunk it all! 
 Ohh... sweet! 
 Is there any more? 
 I'll get it. 
 Then perhaps you can show me how to feed him? 
 It's pathetic, it really is. 
 Goodbye, Pythagoras... 
 Goodbye, goodbye. 
 I know what he needs - something to play with. 
 (baby cries) 
 You're blowing fumes in his face! 
 It's wind. 
 Sorry, it must have crept out. 
 There, there... 
 (baby burps) 
 ..that's better. 
 He's settled down! You're a genius. 
 (she sighs) 
 Yeah. 
 He SHOULD sleep for a while now. 
 What about you, Medusa? 
 I didn't mean... I meant... are you hungry? 
 Would you like something to eat? 
 Maybe a drink? 
 Perhaps some wine? 
 At this time of day?! 
 It's after breakfast. 
 I should go. 
 No, please don't... Give him this if he wakes, all right? 
 Medusa... 
 Idiot, idiot, idiot!! 
 (baby cries) 
 You...your little face... 
 Do you want a bit more? 
 Oh, you're a good boy, aren't you? 
 Yes, you are. 
 Have you had enough? 
 We've got Medusa to thank for this, haven't we? 
 Yes, we have. 
 She's so beautiful. Yes, she is. 
 She's the most beautiful person I've ever met. 
 Apart from you, of course. 
 Why can't I tell her how I feel? 
 Hmm? 
 Because I'm old and fat and she wouldn't give me a second glance, would she? 
 She wouldn't, would she? 
 Oh, those little chubby cheeks. 
 Yes... and a bit more? 
 There we go. 
 Good boy. 
 There aren't even any hoof prints. 
 Whoever abandoned him erased every trace. 
 What must the mother have felt when she left him? 
 Walking away from the baby she bore. 
 No-one would do that willingly. 
 Perhaps it wasn't her. 
 To grow up not knowing your mother, nobody deserves that. 
 Which is why we must do our very best to help the boy. 
 It's just a stone. 
 That's not a stone. 
 That's a shard. 
 A piece of pottery. 
 And look - this must be the grain that was inside it. 
 If we find enough, we might be able to reconstruct some of it. 
 Here... 
 (he chuckles) 
 (he snores) Hercules? Hercules! We bought some pies! Mmm, pie... what, where? What's going on? Careful. Careful. Where's Medusa? Medusa? Oh, she had to go. You see, that's what happens when you try to punch above your weight. Which, let's face it, in your case, is considerable. She had to go to work, all right? Some of us take our responsibilities seriously! I'm sure she'll be back. Do you think? Yeah. There! You sure that's right? Of course. You haven't got it the wrong way round? Or upside down? What's wrong with you two? Can't you see what it is? A rock? A piece of mud? (he grunts) It's a pig! That's its back legs, that's its front legs and that's its snout. (he grunts) Of course. A pig. Obviously. Yes, it's a pig. It was a child's rattle - that's what the grain was for, to make the noise. So, the mother didn't leave him with nothing, she did care. It's beautifully made, look at the detailing along its back. Still doesn't get us anywhere. (he sighs) I'm not sure we should get any further. The child's clearly from a wealthy family. Whatever reason they had to abandon him, one thing's for sure - they don't want him found. Great Artemis, Goddess of the hunt, I make you this offering in thanks for the bounty you bequeathed on us today. Ku-tuu Poseidion. Hey arechay. And now, my friends - enjoy! The Gods have surely smiled upon you today, my Lord. It will take more than a boar for the Gods to favour Laius. Will you hunt again tomorrow? The Gods permitting. Then I shall accompany you. You? Was not Artemis herself a woman? Of course - but her prey had four legs, did it not? It's all right, say what you have come to say. I went back to the place, just as you said. To make sure. The baby was gone. Gone? Eaten by animals, perhaps? There was no blood. Nothing like that. You're sure you left him there? Sure you didn't take pity at the last moment? It would only be natural. No, I swear! I left him just as you said. Then there must be some other explanation - must there not? There were some boys. I followed them back to Atlantis and they ended up in the streets just north of the Canopic Way. And then I lost them. Did they have the child? I'm not sure. You did the right thing, Andreas. Thank you. You may go. Whoever they were, they can't be far. We will make enquiries. There's no time for enquiries. The boy must be found and then...dealt with. We shall have the palace guards search the area around the Canopic Way. What of your husband, the King? You may leave him to me. The child will be found before nightfall, my Lord - I give you my word. (He's gone.) (Operation Cot.) (And cover...) (And toy.) (baby snores quietly) (he exhales) (cock crows) (baby cries) (baby keeps crying) Oh... I did it last time. I did it the last twice. Shhh... Oh, this is not fair! Oh, there we go. (knock at door) There are soldiers outside - dozens of them. We know. What's going on? We've found out who the little fellow is - and it's not good news. It's King Laius's son. What? That can't be right! Why would a king want his own son dead? No-one knows for sure, but Laius has a wandering eye. A son born out of wedlock might threaten the claim of his true heir. They're coming this way! We have to go. Where? I said we should have left him there. You don't mean that, Hercules. I don't know what I mean any more. 
 
 (banging on door) Too late. Open up! In the name of the King! There's a window at the back - we can drop into the alley. It won't take them five minutes to know where we've gone. They don't know anyone is here. They might have seen me. Oh, wonderful(!) Open up! Go to the tavern on the Sacred Way. The landlord is a friend of mine. We can't leave you here! You must! Go, please. (banging on door) Open up! I'm coming! What took you so long? Sorry, I was in the back. (he shouts orders) Do you live alone here, Medusa? Yes. I take in laundry. Hardly the hands of a washerwoman. I do it as a favour. My main job is at the palace. Which, of course, can be verified? Ask anyone in the kitchens. Perhaps I will. Can I go now, please? I should be at work. We're looking for a child, Medusa - a baby. The mother is very anxious to find him. What's that got to do with me? I'm not sure. Perhaps nothing. Can I go now? Yes. You may go. Wait... You forgot your shawl. We have to go down. We can't. Give me the boy. No! You'll never make it. Do you have a better a idea? Come on, give him to me. He's right, Hercules. If you harm one hair on his head... (baby cries) Hurry, they're coming! I don't think I can do this. Course you can. No!! No. Hercules! I'm too old for this. But... Look after him. Look, stop. Go! Now! You've still got it, Hercules, you still have! There it is. (baby cries) (he sheathes his sword) (footsteps leave and he exhales) I'm not sure how much more of this I can take. We need to keep moving. You'll be safe enough here. Just try not to make any noise - the walls are thinner than they look. (door bangs shut) There was to be no trace. It must have slipped from the boy's grasp. I gave him this - on the day he was born. You did the right thing, Laius. You had no choice. You still don't. The boy must be found. The city's already sealed - there can be no escape. I'm told you are a man to be trusted. My Lord. You know what to do? There will be more when it's done. (quiet footsteps) (baby cries) Shhh, shhhhh! Someone will hear. I know that, Pythagoras! Can't you keep him quiet... No! He's hungry. Maybe if I were to sneak upstairs... It's too risky. Medusa will be here soon. That's what you said an hour ago. (banging overhead) Now look what you've done! Get back there! (baby cries) What are you doing to my boy? Hercules? I knew I couldn't trust you with him. Why didn't you give the signal? What signal? The three knocks. Nobody told me. What have they done to you, hey? What have they done to you? He needs food... You did bring food, right? Hercules? I've been avoiding an army baying for my blood - I didn't have time to go shopping, did I? No, I didn't. Wonderful. He just needs some proper care, that's all, don't you? Don't you? One of us will have to go up there. And ask for milk? In a tavern? Well, think of an excuse. Pythagoras is right - it's too risky. The whole city is looking for us. He needs food! (knocking) What was that? I didn't hear anything. Shhh, shhh! (knocking) At last! Oh, we were getting worried. I'm so sorry... Give me the child. I'd rather die! Admirable, but foolish. Never! If you won't give Tiresias the child, then give him to me... his mother. His mother? You call yourself a mother?! How can I thank you? Without you, he surely would have died... If you wanted the child to live, why did you cast him out? You think I could do such a thing? I carried him, I gave birth to him, I cared for him. If not you, then... The King. King Laius cast him out. And to my shame, I helped him. Why? When the boy was born, the King took him to the Oracle. There he learned his dreadful fate. If he lived... he would kill his father. The King then felt he had no choice but to sacrifice him. He belongs with you. (she sobs) My poor, beautiful boy. He can't stay here, Jocasta. If they find him, they will kill him. I know. The net is closing fast. He must be taken from the city. The place is swarming with soldiers! I can hold them back for a few hours more. I'll take him. Are you mad? You understand that if you are caught, I will not be able to protect you? I understand. No - I will not part with him again. Jocasta, you have to. No. I cannot! If you love your son, you must give him up, send him to safety. To keep him here will mean death for you both. I have some food and clothes... The Gods have spoken - is it really your place to intervene? If it means saving a child's life, yes. You can give those to me. You're going as well? Having seen Jason cope on his own, think the little fellow needs me. Make for Zephlon, on the border with Achaea. At the fortress there, you will be met by soldiers from Jocasta's father. He has promised to give the child a good home. You won't be able to get out - the city is sealed. Go via Telapias Gate - the King believes I am in accord with him on this, so I will do what I can to reduce the garrison there. The rest is up to you. You won't let him out of your sight? Not for a second. You can trust him - he'd give his life for this boy. Is there no other way? None. The Oracle also foretold the boy would marry his mother. You're coming? I don't have much choice. How long do you think you'd last without me? Oh, let's see - a lifetime? You'd be in jail by sundown, all of you. Come, I must leave. Wait. One last kiss... What was that for? For being a good man. You have my very life in your hands. It's time. (baby gurgles) You - stop! Me? All of you! What are you doing here? Don't you know there's a curfew? Yes. Sorry - we were in the tavern... You. Open your cloak. We didn't know about the curfew, you see, so we, erm... Open it - or would you like me to do it for you? Is this really necessary? (baby burps) Pardon me - not feeling too well. I must apologise for my friend - he has spent the best part of the day in the tavern. (he laughs) To be honest, I'm surprised he's still standing. Slurring : I've just had a couple of drinks, that's all. I resemble your insinuation, your in-insolution... it's not true. Open the cloak. (baby passes wind) Ooops! Open it. Yes. Of course. (passes wind) Ugh! That wasn't even me. (Sorry.) Take him away - and I don't want to see you here again. You won't, we promise. Thank you. Oh, oh. Ho-ho. Good night. Good night. Thank you very much. I told you you needed me. I would have been fine. With your "Is this really necessary?" That put the fear of God into them(!) I was working on it. We don't have time for this, you can argue later. I'm not arguing, I'm stating a fact. We need a change. What I've been saying for months. Not us - him. I think there's been a leak. Eugh...eugh... Oh... Right. That will have to do. He needs a proper wash. Strangely, Hercules, I forgot to bring my bath. We're not going to make it. Why? We still have a few hours until dawn. That's not the problem - come and see for yourselves. Guard : Move it! We can't risk it. We have to - I promised the boy's mother! We should go back. No. What do you suggest - asking politely - "Please, Mr Soldier, can we come through?" (baby cries) Maybe that's not such a stupid idea... (chattering and orders) STOP! Get him! (soldier groans) Look, over there! GET HIM! This way... He's not coming, is he? Of course he is. If anyone can escape those guards, it's Jason. Do you think so? You've seen him - he runs like the wind. I wouldn't say wind. When I was his age, no man could run faster, jump higher... Yes, yes - or fight better, we know. He's young, that's all. No, Hercules, that is not all... and you know it. Jason is different - special. Yes. Yes, he is. So, he'll be fine, then. Of course he will. This is all my fault, Pythagoras. I knew we shouldn't have interfered. I knew it, I should have insisted. And not have that baby in your arms? You did the right thing, Hercules. We all did. Perhaps we should start for the border. But you said... If the guards catch Jason, they won't relent until he tells them where the boy is. He would never talk. A king's life is at stake, Hercules, they won't stop until he does. It's a good thing they didn't catch him, then. Jason! Whoa - mind the baby! (all chuckle) How did you get away? Oh, you know - the usual combination of skill, cunning, intelligence... I ran. Were you followed? No. They still think I'm in the city. Help me gather some wood. We need to light a fire. He's beyond the city walls. Oh...thank the Gods. Indeed. Why did you help me, Tiresias? You've served my husband loyally for many years. And hope to do so for many more. He is not a bad man, Jocasta. Just one who fears the words of the Oracle. You haven't answered my question. Sometimes, one must follow one's conscience... not one's duty. Now, he needs feeding every three hours, and don't let him sleep more than two hours during the day or you'll never get him off at night... I'll manage. Oh, you don't MANAGE a baby, you care for him. Hercules, he'll be fine. Does he have a name? The boy has a swollen foot, so we thought perhaps... Oedipus? Oedipus, yes, I like it. Then Oedipus it shall be. You WILL look after him? With my life. Are we sure we're doing the right thing? Of course we are - how could you ask? (baby cries) His little face. I know, I know... (baby cries) You are certain of this? Quite certain. I thought that to be true before. This time there can be no doubt... the boy did not suffer, my Lord, that I can vouch for. What did my family do to be so cursed? The Gods require no reason for their cruelty. Make libations to the Gods, Tiresias. They must be placated. At once, my Lord. Your kindness will not be forgotten. We can expect a return visit soon, I hope? Of course. Your Highness. Your hospitality has been much appreciated. You did all you could, Laius - the rest, we must trust to the Gods. You must be sad to see him go. A royal king of such... talents. I did my duty as a host, that is all. You underestimate yourself. Ariadne, why must we always quarrel? I wish you nothing but well. And I wish I could believe that. So, the question is - straight to the baths or straight to Medusa? It won't make any difference either way. If I go straight to Medusa it says, "There is nothing more important than you". On the other hand, I am aware that recent events have, shall we say, produced their own odour. What do you think - baths or Medusa? On balance, a less smelly Hercules is preferable to a smelly one. But... I-I fear the distinction may be lost on Medusa. You don't get it, do you? She kissed me. She KISSED me. It was a peck. It was a kiss. A peck. Whose cheek was it? Mmm? Exactly. I'm going straight to her - true love brooks no hesitation. You better hope it has no sense of smell, either. This will not end well for Hercules. I don't know. I think maybe you're wrong. They might be very happy together. You're right. Perhaps they'll fall in love and have a beautiful home and beautiful children and pigs and chickens. Hercules and beautiful children? I really can't see it. No, he'll get drunk and gamble the home and lose it. He'll eat the pigs... And the chickens, and Medusa will be furious. It's not going to end well, is it? No. No. I have a message for you. The message, who was it from? (he groans) Run. Guards! (horse neighs) You deliberately misled me!
