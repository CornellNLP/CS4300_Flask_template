 Previously on  Legacies...   
 If I'm gonna be a vampire,   
 feed me blood, feed me whatever it takes.   
 There you go. MG, dude's not that big, okay? That's enough.   
 - Back off... 
- [BLADE STABS]   
 DORIAN:  A ripper  is a vampire who is driven by obsession.   
 And do you know what kind of vamps are susceptible,   
 I'd say an impressionable, horny little kid   
 like Milton Greasley.   
 - Who are your parents? 
- My mom's name is Seylah.    
 Gave me up for adoption when I was young.   
 You wanted to find answers    
 about who or what you are.   
 I want those answers, too.   
 LANDON:  Thanks again   
 - for coming to help me. 
- Ictus.   
 Sorry you didn't find your mother.    
 What did you want to talk to me about?    
 I'm really happy that you're back.    
 Do you want to be my boyfriend?    
 LANDON:  I'd really like that.   
 [INSECTS TRILLING]    
 [SNAPS FINGERS] Dr. S.    
 Kaleb. We just killed a mummy and spent six hours in a van together, and I'm not sure...    
 - I can't find MG. 
- What do you mean?    
 I just checked in with his hall monitor, but he missed curfew.    
 Monitor said he tried calling you.    
 Ah, that guy from Triad Enterprises took my phone.    
 All right, whatever.    
 We... we got to find him.    
 This ain't the night for vampires to be walking around unchecked.    
 HOPE:  Have you seen Landon?   
 I thought he might down here with Raf for moral support.    
 Raf's not here.    
 - Wait, he's... What? 
- The supervisors    
 said he didn't check in.    
 And now MG's missing, too.    
 But it's a full moon.    
 [HOWLING IN DISTANCE]    
 Oh, God.    
 HOPE: I don't know why my locator spell didn't work.    
 If you can't find them, it means they're being cloaked or...    
 Or they're dead. I'm aware.    
 What would possess them to leave campus?    
 - Why would they be so irresponsible? 
- They wouldn't.    
 Something must have happened.    
 Hope.    
 Raf? Raf!    
 Hey, are you okay?    
 MG... Landon...    
 Hey, what's going on? Where's Landon?    
 I can't remember.    
 [BREATH TREMBLING]    
 Lunar psychosis?    
 That's a thing?    
 Quit talking.    
 Making noise.    
 [LOW GRUNTING]    
 - [GROWLS] 
- [GASPS]    
 Tardus pulsatio.   
 [AMPLIFIED HEARTBEAT]    
 [LOW PANTING]    
 - It's a thing. 
- What did you do to him?    
 It's okay. I'm just slowing down his heart.    
 It will calm him.    
 [AMPLIFIED HEARTBEAT CONTINUES]    
 What's happening to me?    
 I keep... losing time.    
 As I said... lunar psychosis, which means that your mind is in flux, trapped between... your wolf and human states, making it harder to bridge the gap and access your memories like you normally would.    
 It's very rare.    
 It only happens after a premature reversion.    
 So something caused your body to shift back before the full moon was over, leaving you like this.    
 Wh-What kind of something?    
 Usually trauma. Something bad happened.    
 We don't know that.    
 Three of them left, and only one came back.    
 Something bad happened.    
 [SIGHS]: Hope...why don't you give us a minute?    
 Go on and check on the other wolves.    
 I'm worried about this one.    
 Hope... please.    
 [SCOFFS]    
 [BREATH TREMBLING]    
 What's the danger of him turning wolf again?    
 I mean, this whole wing is filled with sleeping vampires.    
 Don't worry, I'll keep him sealed in.     
 What his mind needs now is to be surrounded by all the things that are familiar to him, that connect him to his humanity, not his lycanthropy.     
 Corum spiritus.   
 Rafael, we'll do everything we can to help you, but you need to tell us exactly what happened.     
 You were supposed to be here on campus for spring break with Landon and MG, and now we can't find either one of them.     
 [EXHALES]     
 [DISTORTED, ECHOING]: Everyone was leaving.     
 Heading home for spring break.   
 All right, everyone, listen up.     
 Absolutely no one leaves campus unless you're in the custody of your guardian.     
 Now, with the full moon approaching, this rule especially applies to our wolves.     
 Now, you know the drill.     
 Vampires to your dorms.     
 Wolves to your bunkers.     
 Absolutely no exceptions.     
 Just because we have a cure for werewolf bites doesn't mean they won't hurt like hell.     
 Now, for those of you who are staying behind, we have some activities planned to ensure that your... vacation will be the...     
 ... dopest, coldest... spring break ever!     
 - [LAUGHTER] 
- All right, here's MG, everybody.     
 Are your mom and dad... dead?     
 No place for you in human society?     
 Does being alone leave you triggered?     
 If your answer to any of these questions is yes, it's okay.     
 The Holiday Committee has your back.     
 [QUIETLY]: Hey, bro.     
 [MG CONTINUES INDISTINCTLY]     
 I need you to do me a favor.     
 Can you look after him while I'm gone on this trip with Dr. S.?     
 MG's doing this little "happy act" thing, but...he gets really weird around holidays.     
 Why?     
 His family...they... they never invite him home.     
 So, you know, just... hit up his little events     
 - and... 
- [GROANS SOFTLY]: Mm.     
 Come on, man, it's-it's the least you can do.     
 Especially after getting down and dirty with the love of his life.     
 Oh, yeah, everybody knows.     
 Yeah, them, too. They know.     
 [SIGHS]     
 - So... 
- All right, uh, whatever, bro.  Me and... and Lan will hang with your boy, all right?     
 It's not like we have anything else to do.     
 MG: Survey says... you just got owned.     
 Don't be mad. This stuff is in my blood.     
 My dad's a trivia god.     
 We play games like this all the time.     
 Uh, we used to.     
 You know, before the...     
 Wait, so let me get this straight.     
 You died and then became a vampire, and then your dad just... ghosted you?     
 Pretty much.     
 Uh, I hear from my mom all the time, and she just says, like, he's busy.     
 Um, either way, we don't talk.     
 Well, maybe you should.     
 RAFAEL: Or maybe some things     
 are better left unsaid, right, Lan?     
 Sure. But, I mean, the whole point of having a family is so you can... be an actual family.     
 Talk about stuff.     
 Look, what I'm trying to say is,     
 if  you want answers...     
 I hope you get them.     
 Because I would do anything to avoid another round of Faction Feud.     
 ALARIC:  No.   
 Please tell me you didn't take MG home.     
 We didn't think it was that big of a deal,     
 - Dr. Saltzman. 
- [EXHALES]     
 They're just right over the state line in Maryland.     
 We were supposed to make it back before the full moon...     
 Yeah, well, you didn't.     
 And now we're here.     
 Ric.     
 Discipline can come after everyone is healthy and safe.     
 Rafael, I am sorry.     
 I am not mad at you.     
 I'm mad at myself.     
 For what?     
 I got to go. I've got a big mess I need to clean up.     
 Hope, stay with Emma.     
 Keep me posted on what you learn, okay?     
 I'll have the school phone on me.     
 [KNOCKING ON DOOR]   
 [SIGHS]     
 What's up?     
 What?     
 Uh... [CLEARS THROAT]     
 - Did you find my boy? 
- Uh, no.     
 I thought you said... and I quote...     
 "Everything'll be fine.     
 I'll handle it."     
 Yeah. That's why I'm here.     
 I need your help.     
 And so does MG.     
 What's with the needles?     
 Sedatives.     
 Sleep isn't really a priority.     
 But safety is.     
 Rafael told me why you couldn't track them.     
 Penelope Park aided them in a cloaking spell before she left for break.     
 Said it was gift for dumping Lizzie on her birthday.     
 HOPE: Great. Then what happened?     
 MG:  For the record, I didn't know   
 that grand theft auto was a part of the plan.   
 No, it's not stealing if you return it.     
 MG: Yeah, well, tell that to Dr. Saltzman.     
 You got some vicious street gangs around here.     
 Why do you think we parked in an alleyway?     
 Everyone thinks I'm dead. 
I can't be seen here.     
 You never mentioned your dad was a politician.     
 MG: He's not.     
 At least he wasn't.     
 He's running for mayor?     
 Maybe Raf's right... maybe this is a mistake.     
 No, the truth is never a mistake.     
 [SIGHS] Took me a long time to figure that out.     
 RAFAEL:  Landon!   
 No!     
 It's happening again. Hand me the syringe.     
 Wait, he's about to tell us what happened to Landon.     
 And if he stays in this state any longer, it'll be that much harder to pull him out.     
 Landon! Run!     
 [RAFAEL GRUNTING, PANTING]     
 Raf! Hey, it's okay. Tell me who's running after Landon.     
 Please. Who's chasing Landon?     
 HOPE: Hey, hey, hey...     
 [GRUNTS]     
 [EXHALES]     
 A monster.     
 It doesn't make any sense.     
 Triad has the urn.     
 There shouldn't be any more monsters, certainly none that made their way through Maryland.     
 He's obviously confused.     
 We need to wake him up.     
 Sleep is the safest thing for him right now.     
 Once he's out of this lunar cycle, we'll be able to recalibrate his brain more easily.     
 But he's the only one who knows where Landon and MG are.     
 Plus, monster?     
 I heard. But as the closest thing this school has to a psychiatrist, my responsibility is to him.     
 And to you.     
 You and I talked a lot about triggers rooted in trauma.     
 I don't need a therapist right now, Emma. I need answers.     
 And you'll get them when I do, causing the least amount of harm to Rafael as possible.     
 [EXHALES]     
 MRS. GREASLEY:  I'm sorry, who are you and why are you here?   
 Uh, hi, Mom.     
 Milton.     
 I wasn't expecting you.     
 It's spring break.     
 Yes, I know. But I thought we agreed it would be best for you to stay on campus.     
 - Well... 
- Uh, Mrs. Greasley, hi. I'm Landon     
 Kirby.     
 Uh, my brother Rafael and I, we're new at the school, and-and we didn't really have anywhere to go for spring break, so we sort of... uh, talked your son into a spontaneous road trip.     
 Which now seems like it may have been a hasty decision.     
 We obviously came at-at the wrong time, so I'll just say hi to Dad, uh, and we'll be on our way.     
 Where's he at?     
 Your father is not here.     
 He's...     
 Running for mayor.     
 The governor thinks he has a great shot at winning.     
 Y'all know the governor now?     
 A lot has changed since you... died.     
 Yeah.     
 I can see that.     
 You know we love you very much, Milton.     
 But the world thinks you're dead.     
 If someone were to see you walking around     
 - in your old hometown... 
- Then let us in.     
 I just want to see Dad.     
 Your father doesn't want to see you.     
 His faith is everything to him.     
 And you know there's no room in his belief system for people dying and coming back to life.     
 Except for Jesus.     
 And Lazarus.     
 He'll come around.     
 It's just gonna take some time for him to get used to the idea.     
 That's his loss then.     
 Let's-let's just go, man. Come on.     
 Come on.     
 Damn.     
 When you said MG going home would be catastrophic,     
 I expected Chernobyl, not Wisteria Lane.     
 Yeah, well, looks can be deceiving.     
 Just... let me do the talking.     
 [CLEARS THROAT]     
 [EXHALES]     
 Dr. Saltzman.     
 Veronica. [CLEARS THROAT]     
 I'm Kaleb.     
 I assume you're here to apologize for my son showing up yesterday.     
 Actually, we're here because he never returned to school.     
 He's gone missing and... we're afraid he contacted his father.     
 Well, I can assure you that didn't happen.     
 MR. GREASLEY: Veronica, who's at the door?     
 Uh, just a solicitor, dear. I'll be right in.     
 So where'd MG go?     
 I don't know.     
 But you're gonna find him.     
 We may not be able to have him here with us, but he was supposed to be safe at your school.     
 We had an arrangement, and I expect you to uphold it.     
 An arrangement, huh?     
 Good thing that don't sound suspicious.     
 Hello?     
 Why'd you bring me all this way if you're not gonna tell me anything?     
 Did you find them?     
 No, not yet. What did you learn?     
 Raf said they got attacked by a monster.     
 Well, that's impossible.     
 - Is it? 
- Where?     
 - And when? 
- I-I don't know.     
 I don't know. Emma sedated him, and he's been sleeping it off for hours.     
 But I have an idea.     
 It's a family recipe from my mom's side, the Crescent Pack.     
 Because they could control their turns at will, they had access to both sides of their minds.     
 All right, well, do what you need to do.     
 I've got to find MG before his father sees him.     
 EMMA:  Absolutely not.   
 This elixir has been in my family for years.     
 Dr. Saltzman said that I...     
 Dr. Saltzman, bless him, is not a medical doctor.     
 Nor am I. And most definitely neither are you.     
 The division between the two sides of Rafael's mind exists for a reason,     
 - to protect his sanity and to... 
- Emma, please.     
 Obviously, something terrible happened.     
 Landon and MG are out there somewhere.     
 Do you think I'm not concerned about them?     
 Of course I am.     
 Then we need to do something.     
 Hope, I said no.     
 And I'm not gonna let you...     
 [GASPS]     
 I'm sorry, Emma.     
 But Hope's right.     
 Do what you got to do.     
 Here.     
 Just drink it.     
 [EXHALES]     
 - [GROANS] 
- Here.     
 [SNIFFS]     
 Okay.     
 [EXHALES]     
 [BOTH EXHALE]     
 You said you saw a monster.     
 I did?     
 Yeah.     
 I don't-I don't... I don't remember that.     
 Okay. Tell me what you do remember.     
 RAFAEL:  I know you think you're helping, but you're not.   
 I mean, just look at him.     
 Just take it from somebody that's been kept in the dark his whole life.     
 At least he knows the truth.     
 And sometimes the truth hurts.     
 You know that better than anybody.     
 Hey. His dad is religious.     
 If Hector and Maria taught us anything, it's what?     
 Religious people aren't too flexible about their beliefs.     
 Hey.     
 Raf's right.     
 My dad's not gonna want a vampire in the family.     
 It is what it is.     
 It is what it...     
 Or maybe it's worse.     
 Look, I took that from your parents' mailbox.     
 Your dad became a prominent figure after he gave a sermon that went viral, a sermon about how he would give anything to have you back.     
 It is one thing to cut you out of his life.     
 It is another thing to use your memory to get votes.     
 [GRUNTS]     
 We can come back another time.     
 It's only a couple hours until moonrise...     
 We can do both.     
 Your dad is giving another speech tonight.     
 And-and it's on the way home.     
 Lan, please, stop pushing.     
 Landon, I don't know     
 - if I... 
- Listen to me,     
 I would give anything to ask my mom and dad why they gave me up.     
 You actually have a chance to.     
 MR. GREASLEY:  When my son used to get in trouble,  he'd always say,     
 "But, Dad, you're forgetting about all the good things I did today."     
 After I lost him, everything in the world seemed bad.     
 But I'm not going to let despair win.     
 I am running for mayor because my son taught me a valuable lesson.     
 Because I don't want us to forget all the good we still can do.     
 What are you waiting for?     
 For starters, I can't feel my legs, so...     
 Someone there?     
 If you're so concerned with... doing good, you might want to take the time to see your own son.     
 Milton?     
 - Is that you? 
- Yeah.     
 Obviously.     
 Good Lord,     
 my eyes must be playing tricks on me.     
 It's me.     
 Same son you're preaching about.     
 Who's apparently gonna win all these elections for you.     
 Who you haven't called in... almost a year.     
 Lord, if this is a test, clear my eyes and let me see the truth.     
 Pops.     
 Don't you love me anymore?     
 My boy.     
 My beautiful boy.     
 I prayed and prayed.     
 And the good Lord brought you back to me.     
 Prayer's cool and all, but you could've just picked up the phone.     
 [SNIFFLES]     
 I saw you on that terrible night.     
 With my own two eyes, I saw you.     
 Now you're here, risen.     
 A miracle sent to me from our Lord in heaven.     
 HOPE:  Wait, wait, wait.   
 So... you're saying that MG's dad didn't know he was a vampire?     
 I'm saying that MG's dad thought that he was dead.     
 RAFAEL:  We didn't want to leave MG behind,   
 but it was getting late.   
 And we knew that I had to get back before I turned, and...     
 [SHUDDERING EXHALE]     
 What?     
 We didn't make it back on time, Hope.     
 [GRUNTS]     
 All good.     
 You sure this is gonna work?     
 Oh, to be honest, bro,     
 this is actually a first for me.     
 But if you have a better idea, I'm all ears.     
 A better plan would've been not leaving the school at all.     
 Well, excuse me for wanting to help MG.     
 [GRUNTS] Or you.     
 And now we're both screwed.     
 'Cause, what, you-you couldn't find your parents, so you... you made him get answers from his?     
 - That's not right. 
- Answers that made his life better.     
 And this is coming from the guy who won't even have the conversation?     
 What conversation?     
 The conversation you have been avoiding all week.     
 And, hey, look at that. I have the key to the padlocks.     
 So... we're having it.     
 I don't know what you're talking about.     
 [SIGHS] Raf.     
 Come on, man.     
 - What? 
- Look...     
 [PANTING]     
 We both know you have feelings for Hope.     
 [SIGHS]     
 That was the slug talking.     
 The slug lowered  your  inhibitions.     
 But it didn't make  you  do anything  you  didn't already want to do.     
 Whether or not I have feelings, it don't matter, 'cause I would never act on them. I would never.     
 I know. Of course I know that.     
 Bro, then why did you just make me say that?     
 Because, Raf...     
 I have seen what happens when you bottle stuff up inside.     
 Sooner or later, that bottle's gonna shatter.     
 And I hate seeing you in pain.     
 - [GRUNTS] 
- Whoa!     
 - [GROANS] 
- What do I do? What do I do?     
 You got to get out of here.     
 Grab MG and steer clear of the woods until morning.     
 No. There's no way. I'm gonna stay right here.     
 We're gonna get through this together, like we always have.     
 [GROWLING]     
 What the hell was that?     
 [SCREAM IN DISTANCE]     
 I don't know.     
 [GROWLING CONTINUES]     
 Oh. [EXHALES]     
 Lan. Lan, look at me.     
 You need to run.     
 Not without you.     
 [GRUNTS]     
 I said...     
 Run!     
 - Raf. Raf. 
- [PANTING]     
 Hey. Hey. Here.     
 Here. Here, here, here, here. Drink this.     
 Drink this. Drink this.     
 [GROANS]     
 - Okay. 
- [PANTING]     
 Hey. What did you see? What did you see?     
 - What were you running from? 
- I don't know. I don't know!     
 Raf, whatever you saw is what made you like this.     
 Did the monster hurt Landon?     
 [WHISPERING]: I don't know.     
 - Is Landon okay, Raf?! 
- I don't know, Hope.     
 I don't know. I don't know.     
 Okay. Do you remember where the woods were?     
 I think so.     
 Yeah, I remember.     
 Okay. Okay.     
 I'm gonna get one of the twins to siphon you out of here.     
 We're gonna go find him.     
 This is the place Hope talked about.     
 She happen to mention that arrangement you made with Mrs. Greasley, too, when she called?     
 MG's mother enrolled him in the Salvatore School without his father knowing that he was still alive.     
 She didn't think his dad could handle the fact that MG was a vampire.     
 Our arrangement was to keep that a secret.     
 [CHUCKLES SOFTLY]     
 Shady.     
 Shadiest part being you saying yes.     
 I didn't want to.     
 But I didn't want to turn MG away, either.     
 I mean, admittedly, it's a bit of a gray area.     
 No, it's not. Life is black and white.     
 You're a teenager, Kaleb.     
 A smart one.     
 Too smart, sometimes.     
 But when you have been through what I've been through and seen what I have seen, you'll learn that life is rarely that simple.     
 Do you smell that?     
 Okay, what is it?     
 Blood.     
 MG?     
 MG.     
 MG!     
 MG. MG.     
 
 
 
 - Oh. Oh. 
- [WHIMPERING]     
 - Damn it. 
- It's okay.     
 - Damn it. 
- It's okay.     
 - Oh, my God. 
- All right, take it easy.     
 Stay away from me, Dr. Saltzman.     
 I can't control it.     
 Shh. It's okay. We're here.     
 We're here. Just tell me what happened.     
 - There are demons all around me. 
- What?     
 Beast horns and devil's tongues.     
 What the hell is wrong with him?     
 He's delusional, which means only one thing.     
 [GROANS]     
 He's been bitten.     
 He's a vampire.     
 - We do the biting. 
- By a werewolf.     
 What?     
 Rafael.     
 He said he saw a monster.     
 He  is  the damn monster.     
 Oh, my God.     
 The infection's spreading to his heart.     
 If he was bitten last night, he's got maybe an hour.     
 Two, tops.     
 What?     
 The cure.     
 G-Give him the damn cure you were talking about.     
 Hope's blood is the cure.     
 The blood of the tribrid.     
 Let's just hope she can get here soon.     
 Just stay with us, MG. All right?     
 We got you. We got you.     
 Why aren't they picking up the phone?     
 I don't know. They must've left the building, okay?     
 And I have the school phone with me.     
 Okay, well, now would be the perfect time to add cellular privileges to the many things that need to change at the school.     
 Don't say that.     
 Pop, why do you... why do you got to say that?     
 Hey, hey. MG, stay with me. Stay with me, okay?     
 Stay with me, man.     
 [WHISPERS]: I just want to go to sleep.     
 No, no, no, no. That's-that's not an option.     
 Okay?     
 So, talk-talk to me more about your pops.     
 Just-just talk to me.     
 He was really happy to see me.     
 He didn't know I was there.     
 And I didn't know how to tell him.     
 MR. GREASLEY:  Your mother.   
 We got to go back home and tell your mother.   
 Uh, sh-she knows. I told her.     
 She... wanted me to spend some time alone with you.     
 Oh. Well, then, let's go across the street to Tippy's diner and talk it over.     
 Almond crumble, two scoops of vanilla.     
 - [CHUCKLES]: Yeah, yeah. 
- Like we used to every Sunday after mass, huh?     
 Yeah, um, I am kind of starving, but somebody might see me.     
 I want the whole world to see you.     
 Shout it out to the rooftops.     
 My boy is back by the grace of God.     
 Yeah, but... your campaign.     
 No one will believe that it's real.     
 They'll think you lied for votes.     
 Well, if I lose an election over that, so be it.     
 The truth is the truth.     
 About that...     
 I-I have something to show you.     
 And I don't think you're gonna like it, but you taught me to-to live by my truth, and-and I want to honor that.     
 [WHISPERS]: Okay. You got this.     
 Son, what's happening?     
 Don't hate me for this, Pop.     
 I'm not human anymore.     
 [GASPS]     
 [GRUNTING]     
 I-I'm sorry.     
 Dear God.     
 Look, it's okay. It's okay.     
 I'm-I'm working on controlling it.     
 There's this school that I go to, and-and...     
 In the name of almighty Jesus, get out of here! Begone!     
 Pops, it's-it's me. It's Milton.     
 You're a demon.     
 Stop!     
 I'm a vampire.     
 And I know you don't understand that,  and I barely understand it myself, but that doesn't mean that I'm evil.     
 I-I just have to try harder to be good.     
 And I'd-I'd tell you to speak your truth, but I kind of have superpowers, so... you don't really have a choice.     
 And I want to know...     
 Tell me...     
 ... how do you feel about me right now?     
 Me, your son?     
 My son is dead.     
 He didn't want me anymore.     
 [GRUNTS]     
 Listen, it takes time.     
 It takes time for some parents to understand.     
 I'll go back there.     
 I'll compel his intolerant ass.     
 Don't bother.     
 I took care of it.     
 I'm still your boy, Pop.     
 Th-The boy who-who sat here and watched you practice your sermons.     
 The boy who still has a lot of good to do.     
 But Mom was right.     
 You're better off thinking that I'm dead.     
 So you didn't see me here today.     
 But always believe that... you're gonna see the... the boy that you love... again.     
 [SIGHS]     
 Know what?     
 You're better off, man.     
 He was right to be afraid of me,     
 'cause I can't control it.     
 Yes, you can. You can control it, okay?     
 You've been working real hard at it, and when we get back to school,     
 - you're gonna keep working hard. 
- I can't go back  to that school, Dr. Saltzman.     
 Not after what I did.     
 Hey, hey, you didn't do anything.     
 It's your sorry-ass parents, okay?     
 They're the bad guys, not you.     
 You're wrong. I'm a killer.     
 - What's he talking about? 
- HOPE: Hey.     
 Dr. Saltzman?     
 Oh, Hope, thank God you made it.     
 What-What's going on?     
 MG has a werewolf bite.     
 He doesn't have much time.     
 [MG WHIMPERING] Hey, hey. You're all right.     
 Oh, my God.     
 KALEB: All right, now. Okay...     
 I bit you.     
 What?     
 This is all my fault.     
 Raf, I'm so sorry.     
 What, sorry? What are you sorry for?     
 He's the one that should be sorry.     
 - He's the fool that bit you. 
- No, no, no, no, no, no. No, no, stop.     
 - Don't move. 
- Hey!     
 Hey. Hey, what's going on?     
 What's wrong? What's going on? What?     
 - Hey. 
- I remember now.     
 The elixir. His face.     
 Being back here...     
 [BREATHING DEEPLY]     
 I remember who the monster was.     
 I said run.     
 I told you I am not leaving you alone.     
 [SCREECHING IN DISTANCE]     
 Damn it, MG.     
 You s-scared the crap out of me.     
 MG, you can't be here.     
 I'm about to turn.     
 It's not safe.     
 For him.     
 'Cause I'm about to kick his ass.     
 What? Why?     
 This was all your fault.     
 You made me come here.     
 You rang that doorbell.     
 You showed me that paper.     
 And you put all your crap on me.     
 Lan. Lan, get me out of these chains.     
 MG, I'm sorry. What happ...     
 - [GRUNTS] 
- Oh! Lan!     
 Okay, I deserve that.     
 Now calm down!     
 RAFAEL: Hey, look at me.     
 MG.     
 No.     
 MG,     
 you can fight this.     
 You have to fight this. Please.     
 You don't understand.     
 [GROANING]     
 I don't have anything left to fight for.     
 My dad was right.     
 I'm a monster.     
 [QUIETLY] You're not.     
 [SCREAMING]     
 [GROWLING]     
 MG, no! MG!     
 [RAFAEL YELLING, DISTORTED]     
 [GASPS]     
 [DISTORTED SCREAMING]     
 -  MG! 
- [CRYING]     
 MG: I did it. It was me.     
 I'm the monster.     
 When you finished your turn, y-you got loose and bit MG.     
 Watching Landon die was too traumatic, too human, so you reverted back and scrambled your memory.     
 I don't want to remember any of this.     
 Raf, where are you going?     
 Away from MG before I finish the job.     
 Hey.     
 Landon's body is out there.     
 I'm gonna go find it.     
 MG: I was so mad.     
 I wanted to h-hurt Landon.     
 I didn't want his blood.     
 I needed it.     
 I needed all of it.     
 'Cause I'm not a monster.     
 I'm a demon.     
 So many demons in hell.
