 Previously on  Legacies...   
 We need to learn more about Landon's past.   
 - Who are your parents? 
- My mom's name is Seylah.   
 Pretty much all I know.   
 She gave me up for adoption when I was young.   
 HOPE:  If we can't figure out what you are,   
 then you can't stay at the school.   
 - What is this? 
- If you ever need me,   
 just press it, and my bracelet    
 will lead me to you.    
 Is that your way of admitting you care about me?    
 HOPE:  I'm assuming you know this symbol.   
 It is the sign of the worst existential nightmare.    
 Malivore.    
 If I return the knife to Malivore, I will be free.    
 The knife is destroyed.    
 One lock is released,    
 and so am I.    
 ALARIC:  That thing is a master manipulator.   
 Look, I am trying to protect you.    
 Don't you dare play disappointed dad    
 because you are not my father.    
 What's wrong?    
 Landon's in trouble.    
 HOPE:  There's something I need to tell you.   
 I just don't know how.   
 So, to make you understand,   
 maybe I should start from the end.   
 Where the hell are we?    
 - What happened? 
- I don't know.    
 But I don't think we're in Kansas anymore.    
 HOPE:  On second thought,   
 I'll just start at the beginning.   
 I know Landon needed me,   
 and at the time, that's all I needed to know.   
 [SNORING]    
 Going somewhere?    
 Better questions,    
 where the hell do you think you're going with my keys    
 and without telling me?    
 Um, you know,    
 I just said some really harsh things to you yesterday,    
 and so I just wanted    
 to get you an oil change as a peace offering.    
 [SCOFFS] At  :   a.m.?    
 Hope,    
 you don't have a driver's license.    
 You were gonna commit grand theft auto,    
 which is a felony.    
 You're ditching school right before the midterm exams begin,    
 and you've made it very clear to me    
 that you see me as an authority figure and nothing more.    
 So tell me, why shouldn't I    
 suspend you this very second?    
 And what is that?    
 It's basically a supernatural compass.    
 Well, I hope it's pointing you to your room    
 'cause that's where you're going.    
 I'm going after Landon.    
 If this thing is glowing, that means that he's in trouble.    
 Then we're going, and I'm driving.    
 HOPE:  I didn't know it yet,   
 but Landon was in Kansas looking for his mom.   
 He had no idea what he was walking into.

 You must have a serious caffeine addiction.    
 You've been here every day this week.    
 I just like coffee.    
 I should get the next one to go.

 This is embarrassing.    
 You've been my best customer this week,

 That's a beautiful one.    
 Thanks.    
 I'm, uh...    
 pretty sure you gave it to me.    
 ["BEE-STING" BY THE WOMBATS PLAYING]    
 [SINGSONGY]: Indiana.    
 Crossroads of America.    
 What's the capital?    
 We learned that in, like, eighth grade.    
 Oh, good, then you should know it.    
 I didn't say I absorbed the information.    
 Yeah, well, you're not saying much of anything.    
 Look, if you can't handle    
 grade school geography...    
 you're gonna flunk all your exams.    
 Are Lizzie and Josie studying? Maybe you should focus on them.    
 Yeah, well, they're still in Europe with Caroline,     
 thank God.     
 Religion has no place in the classroom,     
 Dr. Saltzman.     
 The Supreme Court made sure of that     
 with its ruling on  Engel v. Vitale.   
 And Indianapolis is the capital of Indiana.     
 I'm getting an "A" in geography.     
 Chill.     
 Take the next left. He's on the move.     
 All right.     
 Indiana is surrounded by what four states?     
 I thought we just established that I am dominating geography.     
 Fine.     
 Then let's move on to science.     
 [DOG BARKING]     
 Hello.     
 SEYLAH: Don't touch that.     
 Cool.     
 Um, it's just that I've told you my whole life story,     
 but I don't know anything about you.     
 And, like,     
 all this stuff makes it seem like     
 you've had a really interesting life, and...     
 Is this an actual samurai sword?     
 - Don't touch that, either. 
- [DOG BARKS]     
 I'm sorry.     
 [SIGHS]     
 I'm just not used to having people around.     
 You don't have to apologize.     
 This is, this is weird for me, too.     
 [CHUCKLES] Well, in times     
 of emotional distress, I find that dessert really helps,     
 don't you?     
 Not exactly an expert on the subject.     
 Yes, you are.     
 I'm sorry your life has been so hard, Landon, I really am.     
 I was talking about dessert.     
 And I thought I was putting a positive spin on all the rest.     
 I shudder to think that's true.     
 Um, well, then I'm sorry, too.     
 I know this is a lot to put on you,     
 with me just showing up like this,     
 - but I'd really like to know more about... 
- [DOG PANTING]     
 Is he okay?     
 She. Oh...     
 You didn't feed her from the table, did you?     
 Just a little, but I've-I've never had a dog.     
 I had no idea that this would happen.     
 Relax. She'll be fine. The drugs will wear off soon.     
 What drugs?     
 HOPE:     and a half hours is a long time to spend on the road,   
 and even longer when you're being car-schooled.   
 And that is how osmosis works.     
 Mm.     
 Is this the place?     
 Yup. And not a moment too soon.     
 Pretty sure you were about to tell me how babies are made.     
 Hey, before we go in there,     
 I just want to make sure we're clear.     
 Don't worry, we're crystal.     
 You're Professor X, I'm Wolverine.     
 I was more of a DC kid.     
 Then you're Batman and I'm Robin.     
 Either way, you call the shots.     
 So how do you want to do this, hmm?     
 Fireball? Wind torrent?     
 I was thinking we'd knock.     
 They'll never see that coming.     
 Seylah, Seylah, please,     
 I-I-I didn't want to burden you with this,     
 but I don't... I don't do well in captivity.     
 Seylah, Seylah, I'm sorry. I-I-I...     
 Who sent you?     
 I already told you my miserable life story.     
 Nobody gives a crap about me.     
 Quit playing games. Who'd you call?     
 I don't even have a phone.     
 I never said you did.     
 You wouldn't believe me.     
 What I don't believe is you're my son.     
 So I suggest you spill your guts before the iron heats up.     
 We should come in hot. 
There could be a Jabberwocky     
 on the other side of that door, for all we know.     
 - Nonsensical poem written by? 
- Charles Dodgson.     
 Wrong. Lewis Carroll.     
 [CHUCKLES] The pen name of Charles Dodgson.     
 I'm crushing English, too.     
 [MAN SCREAMING]     
 - No, no, no. 
-  Patere.   
 - [GUNSHOTS, SCREAMING ON TV] 
- Hi.     
 Uh, uh, what-what are you watching?     
 Oh... [STAMMERS] I'm so sorry     
 that we've ruined your lunch. I...     
 I-I promise we're gonna replace your door.     
 That's some compass. 
We're in the wrong place.     
 [CHUCKLES]     
 Someone knew we were coming.     
 [STEAM HISSING]     
 Why so quiet?     
 You wouldn't shut up when we were having lunch.     
 I thought you believed me.     
 Now I'm not giving you anything.     
 [STEAM HISSING]     
 Everyone talks...     
 eventually.     
 Please don't do this.     
 I swear to you I am telling you the truth.     
 I am your son.     
 Stop saying that,     
 or I'll burn your lips shut.     
 The Salvatore School.     
 That's who I called.     
 That boarding school I was telling you about?     
 It's a school for vampires and witches and werewolves and...     
 Because they're real.     
 And so are dragons and gargoyles and freaking talking trees     
 and I don't know what else!     
 You got to be kidding me. You believe that     
 but not that I'm your son?     
 [WHISPERING]: They're here.     
 They must have followed you.     
 [DOG BARKING]     
 [STAMMERS]     
 Wait. You got... You have to cut me loose.     
 [DOG CONTINUES BARKING]     
 HOPE:  Spoiler alert.   
 Our story's about to take one hell of a turn.   
 [DOG YELPS, BARKING STOPS]     
 A monstrous turn.   
 Seylah, is that you?     
 [BONES CREAKING, HEAVING BREATHING]     
 Holy smokes.     
 We can talk about this.     
 [BONES CREAKING]     
 If you have a mouth.     
 [MUFFLED ROAR]     
 HOPE:  I used Landon's bracelet to do a locator spell,   
 but all it located was more trouble.   
 Can I help you?     
 Yeah, I hope so. Uh...     
 [DEVICE WHIRRING]     
 Say, what's going on here?     
 Gas leak. Don't worry, though, we have it under control.     
 You wouldn't happen to know who lives here, would you?     
 We tried knocking, but no one's home.     
 - Um, we're looking for... 
- The highway.     
 See, we're lost, and we... well, we saw you guys,     
 and we thought we'd ask for directions.     
 Yeah, at the end of the road, you make a right. Can't miss it.     
 Cool. Thanks.     
 All right, let's go, Jessica.     
 "Jessica"? Really?     
 I've been part of enough cover-ups     
 to smell one a mile away.     
 Do you think they're after Landon?     
 Well, all I know is they wouldn't have     
 asked about him if they had him, so...     
 we gotta find him before they do.     
 HOPE:  It seemed like the whole world was chasing Landon,   
 but only one person was actually with him.   
 If you won't tell me who they are,     
 will you at least tell me why they are following you?     
 [SIGHS] They weren't, until you showed up.     
 So, maybe they're following you.     
 I'm not stupid.     
 I would have noticed if I was being followed.     
 Close your eyes.     
 How many windows are in this room?     
 What? We just got here.     
 The parking lot, how many cars?     
 I don't know, like ten?     
 The man who gave us the keys, was he right- or left-handed?     
 Nobody notices stuff like that.     
 Three, seven, ambidextrous.     
 - Tell me more about you. 
- Why?     
 Because you care or because you want intel?     
 Does it matter?     
 Either way, I genuinely want to know.     
 Too bad.     
 I've already told you my entire tragic life story.     
 Do you have a girlfriend?     
 Her name is Hope.     
 And she'd probably kill us both     
 if she heard you calling her my girlfriend.     
 - I doubt that very much. 
- Right.     
 Ninja.     
 Hope and I are...     
 complicated.     
 I-I hurt her once,     
 and I don't think she's ever     
 going to forgive me for it.     
 What'd you do?     
 I lied to her.     
 And other stuff.     
 Deep down, I think it's the lying part     
 she'll never understand.     
 She sounds tough.     
 Look who's talking.     
 [CHUCKLES]     
 You two would probably hate each other.     
 I guess it's true, then.     
 Boys like girls who remind them of their mothers.     
 You're stubborn... and surrounded by danger.     
 You're my son, all right.     
 [DOORKNOB RATTLES]     
 Uh, I'm looking for Landon Kirby.     
 And who the hell are you?     
 Uh...     
 People who care about him.     
 So tell me where he is before I blow your head off.     
 You must be Hope.     
 SEYLAH: So you're the headmaster of a private school     
 for supernaturals.     
 And you're the teacher's pet?     
 Actually, she's kind of a pain in my ass.     
 A little judgy for an absentee mother.     
 You were wrong.     
 I like her.     
 Well, now you know about us.     
 All we know about you is that you gave birth to Landon,     
 he says a monster attacked you, and now there's some sort of     
 fake gas company coming after you two.     
 So, I think it's time you start filling in some blanks.     
 When I finished my service in the army,     
 I was recruited by an intelligence organization.     
 The States sounded like a better life.     
 I didn't know what I was signing up for,     
 but soon I learned that things like you     
 exist in this world.     
 My job was very much like yours.     
 To keep the supernatural world a secret.     
 Whenever a monster went bump in the night     
 and risked exposing the truth,     
 I tracked it down and brought it back to headquarters.     
 We're not monsters.     
 You are to me.     
 This headquarters, where is it?     
 Sorry.     
 You just seem morally inclined enough     
 to do something stupid, and there's     
 too much blood on my hands as it is.     
 A few years in,     
 I saw something I shouldn't.     
 I became the hunted instead of the hunter.     
 What exactly did you see?     
 I wanted to know what was happening to the monsters.     
 Because even though I spent all that time     
 studying their every move,     
 I couldn't remember them at all.     
 So I started taking notes.     
 I realized my memory was being erased.     
 The question was: How?     
 Malivore.     
 How do you know about Malivore?     
 Landon took a knife that belonged to     
 our school's collection.     
 Now monsters that shouldn't exist     
 have been coming after it ever since.     
 LANDON: He means I stole it.     
 And then I, like, um, woke it up or something.     
 What's Malivore?     
 It's a hell dimension     
 that consumes creatures and wipes their existence     
 from the collective conscience.     
 Sound about right?     
 More or less.     
 Awesome.     
 The last monster that came for the knife     
 was a Necromancer who screwed us over     
 and returned it back to Malivore.     
 Long story.     
 But he said that the knife is one of three keys     
 that kept Malivore contained,     
 so why are monsters still coming for you?     
 I have no idea. Didn't really get a chance to     
 ask the last one. He just tried to eat me.     
 As you can see, it's been a rough semester.     
 It will only get worse     
 if you don't go home     
 and forget you heard the name.     
 Just like we forget anyone who's ever been there.     
 Wait, wait, wait, wait. 
You-you have to tell us more.     
 I mean...     
 I don't know who your father is.     
 My job was stressful,     
 so I had flings to blow off steam.     
 Got pregnant,     
 and just like your not-girlfriend said,     
 I'm not equipped to be a mother.     
 Sorry.     
 I thought I was giving you a better life.     
 [DOOR OPENS, SHUTS]     
 HOPE:  You want to know the worst part?   
 That wasn't the worst part.   
 [ALARIC SIGHS]     
 Oh, believe me, I would, but I'm...     
 trying to cut back. [CHUCKLES]     
 Look, I get how hard this is,     
 but we need some answers.     
 You already know everything I know.     
 I think we both know that's a lie.     
 Just like you lied to Landon about not knowing     
 who his father is.     
 What makes you think I was lying?     
 Bad liars look away when they lie to their kids.     
 Good liars look 'em straight in the eye.     
 We have something in common, then.     
 You have children?     
 Two girls.     
 So take my hard-earned advice.     
 Tell Landon the truth.     
 How about I tell you instead?     
 Just to see if you believe me.     
 [SNIFFLES]     
 Because I'm still not sure     
 that I believe what I'm about to say, and I lived it.     
 The organization I used to work for     
 guards the portal to Malivore.     
 When I realized I was having memory lapses,     
 I started writing everything down.     
 Drawing maps.     
 I wrote about the creatures I captured and where I took them.     
 Each entry ended there.     
 So where'd you take them?     
 [LAUGHS SOFTLY]     
 Nah, that's not important.     
 Eh, that seems super important to me.     
 Well, then I'm not gonna tell you.     
 For your own good, believe me.     
 One day, I snuck in by myself.     
 And what I found was a...     
 a black pit,     
 locked away.     
 Is that supposed to be a metaphor?     
 Oh, no.     
 It's an actual pit, filled with...     
 tar, uh, or something.     
 A literal pit of doom.     
 The story has it that if, uh, Malivore consumes you,     
 you experience endless darkness.     
 Yeah.     
 It's not just a story, though.     
 And I should know.     
 I've been there.     
 HOPE: Landon, I'm really sorry.     
 Don't be.     
 [SIGHS]     
 It'll be okay.     
 - You can't trust her. 
- I don't.     
 But she's my mother, Hope.     
 All I've ever wanted is a family.     
 A home.     
 So I'm not gonna give up on her     
 just 'cause she's a little screwed up.     
 That would be pretty hypocritical.     
 You're not that screwed up.     
 I hate that you always see me when I'm weak.     
 [WHISPERING]: You're not weak.     
 You're a survivor.     
 Landon, that makes you one of     
 the strongest people that I know.     
 I'm starting to think I'm a bit of a danger magnet.     
 I'm starting to think you're right.

 When my former employers

 So how are we having this conversation?     
 I don't know.     
 I don't even know how long I was in Malivore,     
 only that I felt the things you described,     
 the isolation, the loneliness.     
 And then, one day, I found myself back here.     
 I woke up in the middle of nowhere,     
 covered in mud, absolutely no idea     
 how I got there.     
 Turns out two years had gone by,     
 but there was a bright side.     
 No one I worked for remembered me.     
 So you were free.     
 I wouldn't go that far,     
 because there was also a catch.     
 I was pregnant.     
 Thank you,     
 f-for coming for me.     
 I needed help, and you came.     
 That's never really happened to me before.     
 Sounds like you've had crappy girls in your life.     
 Oh, I've had zero girls in my life.     
 
 
   
 - [CHUCKLES] 
- Unless you count     
 Lisa Marie Albertson,     
 who asked me to take her to the prom,     
 and then, when I said no,     
 told the entire school that it was because I couldn't afford     
 - to pay for it. 
- Well,     
 my first kiss was with a   -year-old vampire     
 who helped murder my mother.     
 - [WHISPERS]: That's terrible. 
- Yeah.     
 And prom is super expensive, so...     
 - People suck. 
- People suck.     
 Hope.     
 Yeah?     
 I will never hurt you again.     
 Ever.     
 ALARIC:  So Landon is basically a, uh,   
 supernatural immaculate conception?     
 I'll be damned.     
 You believe me.     
 My twins were magically transplanted     
 into their mother's womb by a coven of witches,     
 so my belief tolerance     
 is pretty high. [CHUCKLES]     
 I can't imagine how you explained that to your kids.     
 Yeah.     
 It was easier for me to leave Landon     
 in a small basket on the steps of a local church.     
 Oh, you were young, scared.     
 I was selfish.     
 And now I'm tired.     
 I've spent    years trying to stay off the grid.     
 To remain erased.     
 I can't be his mother.     
 Not in the way he needs me to be.     
 Sorry.     
 You can't just leave him, Seylah.     
 He'll be better off. You all will.     
 HOPE:  I should warn you, our story's about to get even fishier.   
 Oh! Hey, uh...     
 Hope, uh, get-get another room. Now.     
 You're the one that's always saying     
 I need to connect more with people.     
 Yeah, not literally. Get out.     
 [QUIETLY]: Get out.     
 [DOOR CLOSES]     
 Uh, Dr. Saltzman. Uh, I'm, uh...     
 A sexed-up teenager.     
 It's perfectly normal.     
 Don't let anyone else tell you otherwise.     
 [EXHALES]     
 So you're not mad?     
 We got bigger fish to fry.     
 We need to talk about your mother.     
 Let me guess. Pizza run?     
 Alaric was right. You are a pain.     
 I'm not the one stealing a car at the moment.     
 It's my car, so it's not stealing.     
 Oh, then you're just afraid to go upstairs and get your keys     
 because then you'd have to tell Landon     
 that you're abandoning him again.     
 Even worse.     
 He likes you, Hope.     
 Be good to him.     
 You first.     
 Now, are you coming with,     
 or do I need to drag your ass upstairs?     
 I never thought I'd see him again.     
 And I was okay with that.     
 Being a mother was never on my list     
 of things to do before I died.     
 Every now and then, over the years, I...     
 I wondered how he was.     
 What kind of person he turned out to be.     
 If he had a nice life.     
 [EXHALES]     
 Turns out he's a good person with a crappy life.     
 He deserves better.     
 Then help make it better.     
 That's exactly what I'm doing.     
 [ENGINE STARTS]     
 What you think you're doing for him doesn't matter.     
 All that he's gonna remember of you     
 is that you abandoned him when he needed you the most.     
 No.     
 He won't remember me, period.     
 And neither will you.     
 Wait, wait, she got pregnant in Satan's mud bath?     
 Yeah, that's-that's a lot to take in.     
 And now she's gone?     
 Look, being a-a parent i-is complicated.     
 Sometimes we convince ourselves     
 that we're doing the right thing, when in reality,     
 we're just being really dumb.     
 Look, I-I've got to check in on Hope, okay?     
 Bigger fish. Huge fish.     
 [SNARLS]     
 Ictus.   
 [CREATURE SCREECHES]     
 Also: ick!     
 See? Danger magnet.     
 - What the hell was that? 
- Uh, I'm guessing a Mer-Man.     
 - A very pissed Mer-Man. 
- Why are the monsters still coming for them?     
 We don't even have what they want.     
 I don't know, but we got to get Landon out of here.     
 - Oh, no. 
- What?     
 You said a necromancer told you the knife     
 was one of three keys, right?     
 The  Necromancer. Like I said,     
 it's a long story, But why does it matter?     
 Son of a bitch.     
 This is Seylah's. I picked it up, but I didn't steal it.     
 I-I... Not on purpose, anyway.     
 I don't know how it got in there, just like     
 how I don't know what happened with the knife.     
 - I swear, I wouldn't do that again. 
- Landon, Landon.     
 It's okay.     
 I believe you.     
 [MER-MAN GROWLS, WATER SPLASHES]     
 Oh, we got to move.     
 No, no, no, wait. Leave it, leave it.     
 - What? Are you out of your mind? 
- No.     
 I'm just sick of playing the same game.     
 So let the monster have it.     
 He'll take it to Malivore.     
 We follow him, we know where it is.     
 ALARIC: I am not taking two teenagers     
 to a covert military hiding place     
 for a demon portal.     
 - You kind of have to. 
- Why?     
 Because Seylah's going there.     
 What? Did she tell you that?     
 In her own way.     
 Hold that.     
 I'll explain in the car. Let's go.     
 H-He's a fish man on land. How fast can he be, right?     
 Oh, my God!     
 Turns out he's pretty fast.     
 Listen, this was your idea. So is it within my bounds     
 as the headmaster to tell you to shut it?     
 What if we don't get there in time?     
 Seylah doesn't have that much of a lead on us.     
 I can't believe she wants to erase herself     
 just to get out of being a parent.     
 What the hell is that?     
 Triad.     
 LANDON: Explosives?     
 On the bright side, maybe this fence stopped     
 our fishy friend.     
 I don't think so.     
 There.     
 Hey, stay back. He's dangerous.     
 I have to get in there.     
 - Landon! 
- Wait, guys, be careful!     
 [BEEPING]     
 HOPE:  I can only speculate about what happened after that,   
 but in hindsight, I think it's pretty obvious.   
 - We got a break-in. 
- I'm on it.     
 HOPE:  Seylah went to Triad.   
 [GUNSHOT]     
 [ALARM SOUNDING]     
 And then she went to Malivore.   
 I'm sure Triad tried to stop her.   
 But she had a reason to fight.   
 And in the end, I'm guessing she won.   
 [GUNSHOT]     
 [GRUNTING AND GROANING]     
 [TAR BUBBLING]     
 She sacrificed herself... for Landon.   
 And then she was erased.   
 [BIRDS CHIRPING]     
 [GRUNTS]     
 [GROANS]     
 Where the hell are we?     
 What happened?     
 I don't know.     
 But I don't think we're in Kansas anymore.     
 LANDON: Thank you again     
 for coming to help me.

 [KNOCKING ON DOOR]     
 - Hi. 
- Hey.     
 Is, um... is Raf here? 'Cause I can come back.     
 No, you just missed the reunion.     
 Now he's off, uh, working out with the werewolves.     
 I was just sitting here,     
 looking at the fancy new clothes the school gave me,     
 trying to make peace with the fact     
 that I may never meet 
the woman in that picture.     
 Which I seem to have lost somehow.     
 What do you think she's like?     
 I think that she's an international assassin     
 that specializes in killing monsters.     
 And that she loves you very much,     
 in her own way.     
 [LAUGHS]     
 Oh, let's be honest.     
 Nobody that cool gave birth to me.     
 So, what did you want to talk to me about?     
 Do you want to be my boyfriend?     
 Are you serious?     
 Deadly.     
 Well, what brought this on?     
 I don't know, I... [CHUCKLES]     
 I guess I'm-I'm just...     
 I'm really happy that you're back.     
 Well, it's a big decision.     
 - I know. 
- We should probably sleep on it.     
 No. Absolutely not.     
 Well, in that case, yeah. I'd really like that.     
 HOPE:  And that's it.   
 Which brings me to my question.     
 What do we do next?     
 ALARIC: How am I supposed to know?     
 I don't remember doing anything you just said.     
 You'll know because you always know.     
 Because you're a good headmaster     
 in spite of all the things that I say.     
 [LAUGHS SOFTLY] Well, in that case,     
 I think the only question we should be asking ourselves is:     
 Why do you remember?     
 I don't know.     
 But I can't imagine that it's good.     
 [SIGHS] And I can lie to Landon about all of this,     
 but I'm sorry, Dr. Saltzman, I just can't lie to you.     
 'Cause I really need your help.     
 Speaking of, there's one more thing.     
 I take it that's the urn     
 I don't remember.     
 Yeah. I figured it was better to have it here     
 than to leave it laying around.     
 So what happens now?     
 I think we're about to find out.     
 [DEVICE BEEPING]     
 What happened here?     
 Unscheduled absorption.     
 What, another rat?     
 No, readings are too big for that.     
 Like, human big.     
 Well, any idea who it was?     
 Of course not.     
 I wouldn't remember     
 if it was my best friend.     
 But I did find this...     
 ...floating on the surface.
