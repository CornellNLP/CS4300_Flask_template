 - Previously on Legacies  
 - ALARIC: Landon took a knife. 
  Now monsters that shouldn't exist have been coming after it ever since. 
  CLARKE: You've been consumed by Malivore? 
  All your friends have forgotten you ever existed. 
  HOPE: Malivore doesn't want me here. 
  Good luck, Clarke! 
  You told me that the monster attacks had stopped, and then, right when I show up, things start happening again? 
  I'm pretty sure I'm the reason. 
  I know you don't remember this. 
  You're the closest thing I have to a father now. 
  It's okay. 
  We'll figure it out together. 
  LANDON: I know you're in there, Raf. 
  We're gonna find a way to get you back, and then everything will be good again, okay? 
  The longer he's a wolf, the less human he'll be. 
  And at what point does a wolf no longer need a human best friend? 
  Maybe he moved on, 'cause he saw that you have someone who can help you be happy. 
  (GASPS) 
  - Rough night? 
  - Yeah, actually. 
  Uh, relationship trouble. 
  Fell for a guy who doesn't even know that I exist. 
  Uh, you must be new. 
  I thought I knew all of the incoming students. 
  Oh, this is a school of some kind? 
  - Wait. 
  What's your name? 
  - Sebastian. 
  - I'm Lizzie. 
  - It's good to meet you, Elizabeth. 
  DORIAN: The faculty are waiting to meet you, Professor Vardemus. 
  Call me "Headmaster". 
  I saw that little spell you cast on your classmate. 
  Offensive magic is a tool that has its place. 
  I'm creating a new magic curriculum for advanced students. 
  I'd like you to be the first. 
  Ooh, ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ooh Ah-ah-ah, ooh-ooh-ooh Ah-ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah Ah, ah-ah-ah, ah, ah-ah, ah, ah-ooh Ah-ah-ah, ooh-ooh-ooh, ah-ah-ah Ooh, ah-ah-ah-ah, ah, ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah-ha All right boys, let's do this. 
  And don't screw up the spelling this year. 
  There's one "I" in dick. 
  Probably should be a you. 
  Was that an insult? 
  I don't know, Dennis. 
  Let me know when you figure it out. 
  Why are we doing this? 
  DENNIS: Because we always do. 
  We vandalize the Salvatore School every year. 
  It's tradition. 
  So is the electoral college. 
  Never heard of 'em. 
  Football team must suck. 
  What are y'all waiting for? 
  I told you what to do. 
  Last I checked, QB calls the plays. 
  I say we go home. 
  The last I checked, I've been starting at linebacker for four years now. 
  And you're only our quarterback because Connor transferred or something. 
  Not the only reason. 
  God also put a thunderbolt in my right arm. 
  So let's just go before you experience it. 
  (ANIMAL GROWLING) 
  It's my truck, and I ain't going anywhere. 
  So do what you got to do, Thor. 
  (LOW GROWLING) 
  Nice night for a walk, anyway. 
  Good luck with the spelling, Dennis. 
  Hey, where are you two going? 
  Pansies. 
  (CHUCKLES) 
  (HOWLING) 
  Night won't be a waste if I can bag a wolf. 
  (GROWLING) 
  - (GROWLING) 
  - (YELLING) 
  HOPE: They say that it's better to have loved and lost than never to have loved at all. 
  Whoever wrote that clearly never experienced the love of their life forgetting their whole existence. 
  It makes you want to be alone, because you can't lose what you never had. 
  YOUNG MAN: Come on, let's go! 
  (VEHICLE APPROACHING) 
  (SIREN WHOOPS) 
  This looks pretty self-explanatory, but you want to give it a shot? 
  Um, toxic masculinity mixed with outdated sports pranks? 
  (CAR WINDOW WHIRRING DOWN) 
  There's no way Hope did it. 
  She's a Timberwolf, not a Stallion. 
  Maya? 
  What happened? 
  Oh, don't worry. 
  She's my mom. 
  (CAR DOOR OPENS) 
  We don't really like to talk about it. 
  - (CAR DOOR CLOSES) 
  - We? 
  - Hey, Hope. 
  - Ethan? 
  So you guys are ? 
  My kids, no matter how much it embarrasses them. 
  'Cause who doesn't like getting dropped off to school in a cop car? 
  I'm on official business. 
  Now show me where I can find Principal Saltzman. 
  (SCHOOL BELL RINGS) 
  Yeah, sorry, I I haven't seen him. 
  Like I said, I'm pretty new here. 
  Well, his teammates last saw him at the Old Mill, by the Salvatore School. 
  We found his truck abandoned, and his hunting rifle nearby. 
  Okay. 
  Well, I will check with his classmates and his teachers. 
  I wish I could be more helpful, but like I said, I'm still getting to know the students. 
  And the sheriff. 
  I was friends with the old one. 
  Please, no more stories about how great Sheriff Donovan was. 
  His shoes are already big enough. 
  And this is my first real case since I moved from the city. 
  Truthfully, I didn't mind that my biggest concern up to this point was a rash of missing dogs. 
  Maybe they're connected. 
  Maybe. 
  (CHUCKLES) 
  I'll leave you my phone number. 
  Call me anytime. 
  (DOOR OPENS, SHUTS) 
  Did you get all that? 
  Yeah. 
  - She's definitely into you. 
  - (LAUGHS) 
  What? 
  No. 
  No, she's just new to town, trying to make friends. 
  Which is exactly what you need to be doing. 
  Yeah, well, tried that last year. 
  Didn't really work out. 
  So I'm gonna focus on monster slaying. 
  Well, it sounds like there could be another monster lurking around the Salvatore School. 
  So I'll check in with Dorian, since he has access to research we don't. 
  Any other ideas? 
  Just one, but, uh we are both going to hate it. 
  VARDEMUS: As you are well aware, it's time for the annual American football match with Mystic Falls High. 
  - (STUDENTS GROAN) 
  - Great. 
  Today, you will not be forced to lose a game so that humans can feel superior. 
  Every one of you is special. 
  Every one of you. 
  And it's time you showed it. 
  (APPLAUSE) 
  How? 
  By using your powers in moderation, Ms. 
  Saltzman. 
  The goal is not exposure, merely to win. 
  Think of it as an exercise in control. 
  Well, I am here for it. 
  After last year, it'll feel really good to show those Timberwolves what we're all about. 
  - Right? 
  - (GENERAL ASSENTS) 
  And who better to lead you in this endeavor, as your quarterback, than our own Landon Kirby? 
  (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) 
  (RAPID KNOCK ON DOOR) 
  We have an emergency. 
  Headmaster Vardemus wants Landon to play QB. 
  Cool. 
  Cool? 
  That's your slot. 
  I'm hunting bigger game this year. 
  (SIGHS) 
  That Sebastian dude you're crushing on? 
  What if he's not a dude at all? 
  I was thinking about it last night. 
  Him just showing up the way he did was super fishy. 
  Given the events of our last school year Compendium Monstrum? 
  You think he's a monster? 
  I'm thinking I can't rule it out. 
  So, sorry, but this is way more important than football. 
  Even though I'm awesome at it. 
  Well Landon pulled his groin combing his hair once. 
  We need you at that game. 
  MG, I am mentally healthy for perhaps the first time in my life, and ready for romance. 
  I'm hoping that Sebastian pans out. 
  But if he doesn't, I need to set my sights on someone else. 
  Like, uh (CHUCKLES) 
  who? 
  The first person that asks. 
  It's the year of yes. 
  Remember? 
  Well, in that case, two sets of eyes are better than one, especially when one of them can vamp-read, so come to the game. 
  I'll help you hit the books, and we can figure out who and what this guy really is. 
  Part of me is worried about what we might find out. 
  You're supposed to say yes. 
  Remember? 
  (GROANS) 
  Fine. 
  Yes. 
  Guess I better go dig up that trash bag of a jersey. 
  LANDON: Yellow 80. 
  Yellow 80 Sorry. 
  Foster care didn't have a football team. 
  What did I tell you? 
  I'm a total fraud. 
  Now the whole school's gonna see it, and - this is a total disaster. 
  - And like I told you, I'm really good at taking care of people. 
  - We're gonna get through this. 
  - How? 
  I can't even throw. 
  Yes, you can. 
  You just need a little help. 
  (CHUCKLES) 
  Viribus. 
  What'd you just do? 
  See for yourself. 
  GUY: Kaleb! 
  Damn! 
  That's my quarterback. 
  ("CREATURE" BY BONES UK BEGINS) 
  Call me dirt or call me diamonds Call me crass or call me cruel - Call me daddy - Do you know that girl? 
  Not really. 
  We just, uh shared a milkshake once. 
  Let's just get this over with as fast as possible. 
  Works for me. 
  I'm no more comfortable being here than you are. 
  Ric There's something that you need to see. 
  (CHEERING) 
  Let us begin our annual rite of American excess. 
  But unlike last year, I expect no unseemly violence, only for each team to play to the fullest extent of their abilities. 
  Understood? 
  Timberwolves of Mystic Falls, you may, as I believe they say, call it in the air. 
  Heads. 
  - Tails never fails. 
  - We'll take the ball. 
  So it begins. 
  Uh, shake hands. 
  Having another milkshake moment? 
  Sorry. 
  (SCOFFS) 
  We found him wandering the woods, half out of his mind. 
  He didn't settle down until we compelled him. 
  (SIGHS) 
  Does he remember anything? 
  Tell him what you saw, Dennis. 
  It was some kind of animal. 
  Like a-a hyena mixed with a wolf, with huge claws. 
  It grabbed me. 
  I thought it was gonna eat me, but then it spit me out. 
  Hmm. 
  Does that ring any bells? 
  Closest thing I could find was a Shunka Warakin. 
  Until this morning, it was a Native American myth. 
  Roughly translated, it means "carrying off dogs". 
  Lucky for Dennis, according to Ioway legend, all it eats are werewolves. 
  ALARIC: Dorian found the missing kid. 
  Thank God he's okay. 
  But we definitely have another monster wandering around these woods. 
  Dorian's digging into the research, but he thinks it's a Shunka. 
  - What's - And before you ask what that is, it's a carnivorous creature that feeds only on werewolves. 
  Good thing it's not a full moon. 
  Yeah, except Raf has been stuck in wolf form ever since you've been gone. 
  Wait, Raf? 
  - I didn't even know that he turned. 
  - Yeah. 
  Happened fighting Triad. 
  Hasn't been able to turn back since. 
  Yeah, of course he can't turn back. 
  I'm the only one that can turn him back. 
  I'm the one that gave him that crescent moon ring. 
  Okay, look, I've got to go find him before the Shunka finds him first. 
  (LOW GROWLING) 
  (SNIFFING) 
  (SNARLING) 
  (ROARING) 
  (CHEERING) 
  JOSIE: I got it. 
  I got two nights in a row Oh, we gon' put on a show - What? 
  - With the black bull in tow (LAUGHING) 
  - (CHEERING WILDLY) 
  - (GRUNTS) 
  Don't look at me like that. 
  (WHISTLE BLOWS) 
  HOPE: I need to get out of here and find Raf. 
  Agreed. 
  We just need to find a way to ditch this game. 
  No. 
  Rafael is my responsibility. 
  You need to stay here and keep an eye - on that new headmaster. 
  - Why? 
  Because he already used magic to cheat. 
  He's up to something. 
  Caroline picked my replacement herself. 
  There's no way that she's gonna hire a weirdo with an umbrella. 
  Okay, I'm on it. 
  Okay. 
  Now to plot my escape. 
  Wish me luck. 
  Break a leg. 
  - Hey. 
  - Hey. 
  I thought I had her. 
  Trick play, I guess. 
  You have no idea. 
  We're screwed. 
  Hey, it was just one score. 
  And you're gonna march us straight down that field and tie us up. 
  What do you mean? 
  Your brother's the quarterback. 
  No, not today. 
  He can't risk blowing out his knee on some pick-up game, so we're all counting on you. 
  Come on. 
  You got it. 
  Oh Did you see that block? 
  I totally opened up the lane and sprung that play, in a respectful way. 
  Sorry, too busy figuring out if I'm falling in love with a yeti. 
  And? 
  Inconclusive. 
  You're supposed to be helping me. 
  Okay, I'll take the next series off and dig in. 
  (AIR WHOOSHING) 
  You're a really great You're just really great, MG. 
  I don't know what I'd do without you. 
  Let's figure out what to do about Sebastian first. 
  Then we can worry about me. 
  Okay, uh, all right, guys, let's do this. 
  Do what? 
  You're the quarterback, Hope. 
  You call the plays. 
  Everybody go long? 
  Works for me. 
  Timberwolves on three? 
  - One, two, three. 
  - ALL: Timberwolves! 
  I'm living the big city life, just doing what I can To get by waiting tables, yeah, I'm working for the man And you know, lately it's starting to feel awful like - I'm always on the back foot - You're blitzing on first down. 
  Cool. 
  Uh, what does that mean, exactly? 
  It means the second she snaps the ball, you yell "blitz" and you bury Little Miss Milkshake. 
  - Yeah - That's aggressive. 
  You have a problem hitting her or something? 
  She has no problem hitting on you. 
  Consider her blitzed. 
  It feels like I'm always on my back foot Yeah That's aggressive. 
  - Everybody says that I'm a slob - Oh That I'm a waste of space and super lazy, oh, my God - Landon! 
  - Oh, uh, blitz! 
  I'll be right here, sleeping on the job Getting paid six-eighty to wait on tables Of rich ladies and their dogs I wish that I had more than I got - I got it. 
  - I got it. 
  (GRUNTING) 
  - (CROWD CHEERING) 
  - What was that?! 
  And balling like The Rock, but you know Lately, it's starting to feel awful like (CHEERING WILDLY) 
  (WHISTLE BLOWS) 
  Yeah! 
  (GASPS) 
  Hell of a throw, Johnny Utah. 
  (CHUCKLES) 
  Ow. 
  - Are you okay? 
  - Uh-huh. 
  - I'm so sorry. 
  - Oh, it's okay. 
  Um, yeah, I think it's just twisted. 
  Yeah. 
  Um, well, there's a nurse's office in the school. 
  First floor, right inside. 
  Okay. 
  You'll see it. 
  Okay. 
  Uh, I think I'll find it, thank you. 
  (GROANS) 
  ALL (CHANTING): Let's go, Stallions, let's go Looks like you need a new quarterback. 
  Happy hunting. 
  What was that all about? 
  Josie. 
  I hurt her. 
  No, you didn't, she's fine. 
  She was clearly faking. 
  Why would she fake something like that? 
  Why are you taking her side? 
  It's not about sides. 
  I'm just being a decent human being. 
  Well, you're not a human, you're a phoenix. 
  This is a game where there are sides. 
  Plus, I mean, there's something off about her. 
  I just I don't know what, but there's something. 
  Yeah, she's not the only one. 
  (DOOR CREAKS) 
  Stop, stop, stop. 
  You're here for a reason. 
  What are you doing in my room? 
  - Uh look, I know that this looks bad - No. 
  It looks like magic. 
  Corporis impetus! 
  I'm starting to think you're not some ordinary girl. 
  Look, my name is Hope, okay? 
  I-I'm a witch. 
  I'm working with Dr. 
  Saltzman. 
  He asked me to do a locater spell to find Rafael. 
  Why wouldn't he ask one of his own daughters? 
  Because they don't know about the Crescent Wolf Clan. 
  Not like I do. 
  Wol I-I've read about that. 
  Does that mean you can turn Raf back? 
  Saeclum. 
  There is a monster in the woods, and it feeds on werewolves. 
  Ooh. 
  Then I'm coming with you. 
  Sorry, but I fly solo. 
  Uh He's my best friend. 
  You do realize I could freeze you again, right? 
  Would that spell last forever? 
  Just try to keep up. 
  Okay, okay, Stallions, I see you. 
  - That's what I'm talking about. 
  - Nice job, guys. 
  Good half. 
  Now, we can take it easy. 
  This game is done and dusted. 
  - Hey. 
  - No, it's not. 
  - We need to score more. 
  - KALEB: We're up 35-7, Jo. 
  No reason to rub it in. 
  I mean, it sounded cool and all, sticking it to the townies, but now it feels wrong. 
  I don't think we need to use our powers in the second half. 
  What? 
  Why not? 
  (SIGHS) 
  Because your dad was right about the way the game should be played. 
  He was right about a lot of things. 
  But you already know how I feel about that subject. 
  So, I'm guessing you don't want to play quarterback, then? 
  Mm-mm. 
  Because I don't think that Landon's coming back. 
  Someone needs to step up. 
  You serious? 
  I'll do it. 
  No offense, Wade, but no. 
  If we're not gonna use our powers, we need the old magic back. 
  Pass. 
  VARDEMUS: Enough leisure. 
  Get back out there and showcase your superiority. 
  Dad. 
  Hi, girls, uh, I just need a moment with your headmaster. 
  Hey. 
  (ALARIC CLEARS THROAT) 
  What is it, Coach? 
  It's Principal Saltzman. 
  I'm well aware of who you are, Dr. 
  Saltzman. 
  In fact, you being who you are is why I have your old job. 
  Mm. 
  I know what you're doing. 
  You're embarrassing my kids. 
  Now ease up in the second half. 
  Did you ever occur to you that my kids are simply superior to yours? 
  Of course they are. 
  And it's obvious they're using their magic, and it isn't fair. 
  The only people to whom that's obvious are you and me, so I don't see the problem. 
  And to be clear, what wasn't fair was you stifling their abilities all these years. 
  I was trying to protect them. 
  How did that work out? 
  What the hell is your deal? 
  Hmm? 
  Forget about football. 
  What game are you really playing? 
  Best of luck, Coach. 
  I anticipate you'll need it. 
  (PHONE RINGING) 
  (SIGHS) 
  Some good news, Dorian? 
  Maybe next year I can coach the game and you can do the monster research. 
  In the meantime, here's that good news you asked for. 
  So, killing a Shunka is pretty much like killing anything else. 
  You want to go for the heart, the throat or the brain. 
  - Sounds easy enough. 
  - Kind of. 
  It's bigger than I thought. 
  How big? 
  About the size of your truck. 
  And the hide's thick, too, so probably easiest to get it from the back. 
  Good to know. 
  - Anything else? 
  - Yeah, I found this one weird reference that says it cries like a man. 
  Not sure what that means. 
  Well, hopefully it'll be dead before we find out. 
  I'll let Hope know. 
  HOPE: Yeah, Raf should be up ahead. 
  - Cool. 
  - Meaning not cool? 
  Sorry. 
  It's just nothing. 
  Meaning something. 
  It's stupid, but when Raf was first stuck as a wolf, he used to always hang out with me, but then he, like, he stopped. 
  Like, he forgot or he moved on. 
  And you're worried that it's gonna be the same when he's human again? 
  Told you it was stupid. 
  I don't think it's stupid. 
  It's painful to lose someone that you love. 
  (QUIETLY): Yeah. 
  Oh, I know all about that. 
  I grew up in the foster system. 
  Getting bounced around from family to family made me want to shut everybody out until I realized life's a lot harder without someone watching your back. 
  Trust me, Landon, you don't have to worry about anyone forgetting you. 
  DENNIS'S VOICE: Help! 
  Help! 
  Somebody, help! 
  Landon, wait, stay back. 
  You don't know what's out there! 
  (GROWLING) 
  I have an educated guess. 
  I said stay back. 
  Incendia. 
  (WAILING) 
 
 
 
  Is there a plan "B"? 
  Please tell me there's a plan "B". 
  - Turn around. 
  - Why? 
  Because plan "B" involves me getting naked. 
  What? 
  I have to draw it away from you. 
  Why does that require nudity? 
  Because this monster feeds on werewolves. 
  But you're a witch. 
  A lying witch. 
  A lying, very naked witch. 
  Look, I'm more than that, and I wish I could stay and tell you all about it, but I can't. 
  So when I draw this thing away from you, I need you to go find Dr. 
  Saltzman and Raf. 
  Why would it after chase you (GROWLING) 
  Because you're a were-witch. 
  Holy smokes. 
  (HOWLING) 
  (GROWLS) 
  Not the droids you're looking for, so please move along. 
  What are you guys doing? 
  The second half's about to start and we're down a QB. 
  You want to throw a bit, loosen up? 
  I'd rather just leave now. 
  I mean, there's no way - that I'm playing quarterback. 
  - Cool. 
  'Cause I was thinking I would. 
  I thought you were worried about getting hurt. 
  ETHAN: The Stallions need to worry. 
  'Cause we're about to take this ball and stick it in the end zone! 
  (CHEERING) 
  (CROWD CHEERING) 
  (WHISTLE BLOWING) 
  (GRUNTS) 
  Don't even ask. 
  Okay, teenage Tom Brady is killing us. 
  So come ball out. 
  You at QB, me at wide receiver. 
  Hooking up. 
  In a purely athletic sense. 
  Do I look pretty when I play quarterback? 
  Are you kidding me? 
  You are the hottest thing I've ever seen. 
  Then put me in, Coach. 
  Okay, since you guys can't seem to stop Captain America or not fumble a kickoff, our lead is bleeding like a stuck pig. 
  But fear not. 
  I'm super absorbent. 
  Wow. 
  Uh, the hell's that supposed to mean? 
  It means we're gonna play-action, all nines, bootleg left center deep cross. 
  Make that a bootleg right. 
  - That's my good side. 
  - KALEB: (SCOFFS) 
  Whatever. 
  As long as we're playing it straight. 
  Uh, what do, what do I do? 
  You go long, Wayne. 
  Real long. 
  - It's Wade, actually. 
  - You still go long. 
  - All right. 
  - Ready? 
  ALL: Break! 
  Just try and hold onto the ball this time. 
  They're gonna go deep. 
  Keep your eyes open. 
  Might start a riot (WHISTLE BLOWS) 
  From my mouth, I won't be quiet 'Cause everything is nothing till you realize It's something you want White 80. 
  Set. 
  Hut! 
  I want to lash out I want to let it out 'Cause I can feel it On the back of my tongue On the back of my tongue (WHOOPS) 
  Oh, oh Oh, hard to hold This fire inside me All I know Is sometimes it's frightening (SHOUTING INDISTINCTLY) 
  This fire inside me Josie. 
  What did I just tell you? 
  JOSIE: What, you think I did that on purpose? 
  I'm trying to bury these guys, too. 
  (AIR HORN BLOWS) 
  (WHISTLE BLOWS) 
  - Whatever. 
  None of this matters. 
  - Lizzie. 
  Where are you going? 
  - I'm on it. 
  - No, MG, wait! 
  Out of the bottle Lash out. 
  Landon! 
  Landon? 
  (SIGHS) 
  Landon! 
  Look, I'm sorry, I would have never left you. 
  I didn't know that it wanted you. 
  (GROWLING) 
  Raf. 
  Hey, look, I-I know you don't remember me, but this is all my fault. 
  Okay? 
  I would have never let anything like this happen to you or Landon. 
  Wait, Raf, wait. 
  Please. 
  Don't-don't go. 
  Okay, I I can help you. 
  I need you. 
  (WHINES) 
  Landon needs you. 
  We need to do something. 
  This is embarrassing. 
  Why have you stopped using your magic? 
  Because Kaleb said - Because my dad said - Your father is no longer your headmaster. 
  I am, and unlike him, I've never broken your trust. 
  So perhaps you ought to take what I say with the same consideration. 
  - What do you want me to do? 
  - ALARIC: One more score ties it. 
  Keep it up! 
  Rock it MAC: Great news. 
  That kid Dennis turned up. 
  A little hungover, but otherwise safe and sound, so I guess I'll go back to looking for those missing dogs. 
  Well, you're here just in time. 
  Your son's leading one hell of a comeback. 
  Oh, I didn't think Ethan was playing. 
  - ALL: Go! 
  - Come on, guys! 
  Get in the groove, rock it Just whip it good, so your body can move - (WHISTLE BLOWS) 
  - Pink 21! 
  Pink 21! 
  Just whip it good Blue 48! 
  Hut! 
  Everybody, let loose (GRUNTS) 
  Tenebris lapsus. 
  (SCREAMS, GRUNTS) 
  WOMAN: Oh, my God. 
  - Oh, God. 
  - WOMAN: Is he okay? 
  Babe, babe, babe, come here, it's okay, just breathe, - sweetheart, just Hey. 
  - (STRAINED SCREAM) 
  (ETHAN GROANING) 
  Get a medic! 
  (INDISTINCT RADIO CHATTER) 
  What the hell did you do? 
  Are you blaming me for this unfortunate accident? 
  It's not my fault the human body is so frail. 
  Stop it. 
  Stop pretending that you're above it, Gary Poppins. 
  I saw you give something to Josie. 
  If I find out you had some part in this She'd tell you. 
  Wouldn't she? 
  She's your daughter, after all. 
  That's right. 
  And don't you forget it. 
  If anyone has something to forget, it's her. 
  And all the rest of your former students. 
  It must have been traumatic to have their authority figure treat them like animals in a zoo. 
  That is not what happened. 
  Isn't it? 
  I fear the gap in our ideologies cannot be bridged, Principal Saltzman. 
  I must ask that you not set foot on this campus again. 
  For the sake of the students under my protection. 
  My daughters go to this school. 
  You can't do that. 
  I just did. 
  Of course, you can always enroll them in public school. 
  But if you're honest with yourself, you know the best place for them is here, with me. 
  And away from you. 
  (EVERYONE EXCLAIMING) 
  (SHOUTING AND GRUNTING) 
  Not again! 
  Break it up! 
  Sebastian? 
  Sebastian. 
  (SIGHS) 
  Elizabeth. 
  Are you following me? 
  I told you. 
  Most people call me Lizzie. 
  I am not most people. 
  Which is why I told you we cannot go down this path. 
  But you never explained why. 
  And then you showed up at the game, and I'm sorry, but that is a typical dude move. 
  I had to see you again. 
  You remind me of someone I used to know. 
  I don't know. 
  I'm pretty unique. 
  (CHUCKLES) 
  Yes. 
  As was she. 
  I once thought that she was the most beautiful young woman I would ever see. 
  Is that line supposed to work on me? 
  Either way, it is a line - that we cannot cross. 
  - Why not? 
  And no riddles this time. 
  Because you bewitch me, Elizabeth. 
  Well, duh. 
  I'm a witch. 
  Are you a monster? 
  Yes. 
  I am a vampyr. 
  Creature of the night. 
  Oh, thank God. 
  (CHUCKLES) 
  Uh, um I'm a bit confused. 
  So was I. 
  I thought you were, like, a kraken or something. 
  But this is no big deal. 
  Some of my best friends are vampires. 
  Are we to just be friends, then? 
  No. 
  Because friends don't get to do this (HOWLING) 
  (GROWLING) 
  Hope? 
  No! 
  (SCREAMING) 
  (GROWLING) 
  Raf. 
  Lan, it's not done! 
  (GROWLING) 
  (SCREAMS) 
  I thought you were gone. 
  You can stop thinking it, bro, 'cause I'm back. 
  (LAUGHS) 
  Thanks to you, man. 
  No, it was, it was her, she - She saved us both. 
  - What Who was that girl? 
  HOPE: The thing about being alone is that it can never last. 
  JOSIE: Dad! 
  Dad! 
  Waves on the ocean Hearts in the sand HOPE: At some point, we all need to reach out and find comfort. 
  At first, to what we know: the people, the places, how everything used to be. 
  Grace washing over you Ooh Ooh (SOFT PANTING) 
  (FRIGHTENED WHIMPERS) 
  So hold the ones you love tonight (GROWLING) 
  Don't let go, don't blink - Easy. 
  Stop. 
  - 'Cause time is gonna Pass you by HOPE: But things change. 
  And no matter what you do, it's never gonna be the same. 
  So the question becomes, where do you go? 
  What do you do? 
  - What if all we have is now? 
  - Hope? 
  Hey. 
  What are you doing here? 
  I just, I wanted to see how you and Ethan were doing after the game. 
  He worked so hard for that scholarship. 
  And now it's over. 
  Hey Maybe it doesn't matter as long as you go somewhere. 
  Billions of miles will fade into dust Hey. 
  How's Raf? 
  So hold the ones you love tonight Adjusting. 
  Don't let go, don't blink That's more than I can say. 
  I don't know why I'm acting like this. 
  I feel like, I don't know, something inside me is just off. 
  It's always ticking down Sounds like we both had a day. 
  You want to go first or should I? 
  What if all we have is now? 
  After you left the game I did something horrible. 
  I hurt someone. 
  (WHISPERS): And I think I wanted to. 
  So hold the ones you love Whatever you did, it wouldn't have happened if I'd just listened to you. 
  Don't blink, 'cause Time is gonna You were right about Hope. 
  The girl from the football game? 
  She's definitely not who she says she is. 
  Who is she? 
  I was kind of hoping you'd help me figure it out. 
  Along with a bunch of other stuff, too. 
  Like what? 
  The monsters are back. 
  I have no idea how or why, or if it's gonna stop. 
  All I know is that whatever I did to take down Malivore, it didn't work, and now I think the monsters are coming after me, and Hold the ones you love Tonight Don't let go But seeing you is the only thing that's making me feel a little bit better about any of this. 
  I'd really like to kiss you now. 
  It's always ticking down. 
  Landon whatever monsters are coming for you from Malivore, are gonna have to go through a very powerful witch who apparently has anger issues. 
  I'm not gonna let them get you. 
  Okay? 
  I promise.
