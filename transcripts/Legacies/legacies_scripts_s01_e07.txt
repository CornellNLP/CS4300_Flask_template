 Previously on  Legacies...   
 You know, I opened this school to protect these kids.   
 How am I supposed to protect them   
 from stuff that's not supposed to exist?   
 Hell, they even make rules about how we're supposed to eat but they don't tell us what they're actually feeding us.   
 There's blood bags in that refrigerator right there.   
 But not human blood!   
 I killed my girlfriend.    
 I was behind the wheel and I lost control.    
 When I woke up, I was in the hospital, and I don't know anything else.    
 Are you happy?    
 I am happy right now.    
 In the arms of my demon-possessed baby mama.    
 DORIAN:  The monsters come one at a time.   
 I found myself not far from here with an urge to possess that knife.    
 And who told you to do this?    
 The Necromancer.    
 If you're the one responsible    
 for what went down today,  you're gonna wish you were someone else.

 Was that really necessary?    
 I told you I need answers.    
 Why would I help you? 
You have me in chains.    
 This indignity will not go unpunished.    
 We have been at this for days.    
 Answer my questions, or I'm gonna peel your skin off like a grape and shower you with battery acid.    
 [GROANS] A rather grotesque effort, considering it will feel like the delicate tickle of a feather.    
 All right.    
 Let's see how this feels.    
 Dr. Saltzman.    
 Oh, there you are, lovely girl.    
 I was wondering if you'd come visit me again.    
 How's your friend, the one I saw you with earlier, trying to steal an illicit peek at me?    
 As we speak, he's having an emotional reunion with his dead girlfriend.    
 I assume we have you to thank?    
 Poor dear.    
 Her spirit was clinging to him like a vine in winter.    
 It took barely any effort.    
 Just a little wrinkle of the nose, and poof.    
 Young love reborn.    
 You're lucky that's all I did.    
 The way you've treated a man of my stature, you should be ashamed.    
 Literally nobody knows who you are.    
 [SCOFFS] That's impossible.    
 I'll check on Raf.    
 I-If you want an end to this misery, simply bring me the knife and I'll be    
 - on my way... 
- ALARIC: Hope!    
 Oh...    
 I take it things aren't going well?    
 - He's a diva. 
- So what's the plan?    
 I know you don't want to give over the knife, but we can't have him raising the lost loved ones of every person in this school.     
 I will handle it. I have questions that need answers.     
 Okay, well, I'm not sure your methods are the most effective.     
 Hope. I said I will handle it.     
 Now, just stay away from him.     
 ALARIC: Cassie, is it?     
 Cassie, I'm Dr. Saltzman.     
 I am here to help you.     
 I... I don't understand what's happening.     
 Why am I here?     
 I didn't know what to tell her.     
 Um, well, do you mind telling me the last few things that you remember?     
 Um...     
 Raf and I were driving home from a track meet.     
 The roads were bad, it was wet, and then dark, and I heard this voice telling me to open up my eyes, and then I was here.     
 Okay. Well, listen, this is gonna be really hard for you to understand,     
 but... those memories you have, those are from two months ago.     
 You were in a car accident.     
 You didn't survive.     
 And tonight, you were resurrected from the dead.     
 [GASPS SOFTLY]     
 HOPE:  Find anything yet?   
 Necromancy is everywhere in occult literature.     
 It's a form of sorcery that dates back to ancient Greece.     
 It involves the ability to communicate with and raise the dead.     
 But there's nothing about a specific necromancer, so whoever this dude is,     
 he's been erased from history like every other monster     
 that comes looking for the knife.     
 Is there any way to stop him from bringing back dead people?     
 Because if this week is any indication,     
 it's kind of becoming a thing.     
 I'll look into it, but tomorrow's my day off,     
 so it might take a minute.     
 Evil never takes a holiday, Dorian.     
 Well, every year on Remembrance Day, I do.     
 I write my letters, pack my lunch and I head to the cemetery     
 and ring that bell in honor of my dead family.     
 So for the next    hours,     
 ask Dr. Saltzman.     
 Fair. But I'm worried about him.     
 Do you think he's okay?     
 I think after the week he's had, he needs a nap.     
 [CHUCKLES]: And a therapist.     
 Maybe even a vacation of his own.     
 Take these to him for me, would you?     
 - Thanks. 
- Thank you.     
 [EXHALES]     
 [INHALES]     
 Ah.     
 Ooh.     
 You have a powerful scent of death on you.     
 Uh-huh...     
 It's quite lovely, really.     
 I thought maybe we could talk.     
 [SIGHS]     
 Such a puny creature dares to dalliance     
 with The Almighty Necromancer?     
 Well, here's the thing about that.     
 You don't exist.     
 I won't fall     
 - for your mind games. 
- This isn't a game.     
 Let me lay it out for you.     
 You died,     
 you were in a dark place     
 for what felt like an eternity,     
 until suddenly, you were pulled into the light     
 with a singular, inexplicable mission     
 to retrieve a knife.     
 Do continue.     
 It's been the same with all the creatures that came before you.     
 A dragon,     
 a gargoyle, a...     
 an Arachne, a dryad.     
 Bah. Such creatures     
 - exist only in fiction. 
- No.     
 They've been erased from history, and so have you.     
 [LAUGHS] That's preposterous.     
 I'm world-renowned.     
 People tremble at the sound of my name.     
 Don't believe me?     
 Read up.     
 [INHALES SHARPLY]     
 No! No! No!     
 No! No!     
 No!     
 [SHOUTS]     
 A lifetime's work,     
 my legacy, reduced to something as-as pitiful     
 as a brand of sorcery?     
 Where I am barely a footnote?     
 [GRUNTS]     
 Who's responsible for this vile affront?     
 That's what I'm hoping you can help me figure out.     
 Well, then, I'm all ears.     
 HOPE:  If you want to get to the bottom of this,   
 we need to know who's communicating with you.     
 No one's communicating with me. My mind is a steel trap.     
 But you knew to resurrect Dr. Saltzman's dead fiancée     
 right after he mentioned her to the dryad.     
 That's why he had questions.     
 It can't be a coincidence.     
 You're all coming after the same thing,     
 communicating in some way, so who's pulling the strings?     
 I am no puppet.     
 [EXHALES]     
 It's less a voice, more an instinct.     
 I simply know things.     
 Like you know you're here to retrieve a knife     
 and return it to a place called Malivore.     
 If I return the knife to Malivore, I will be free.     
 - Of what? 
- The blackness.     
 The void. The empty oblivion.     
 Do you ever just say things once?     
 And more importantly,     
 do you know how to get there?     
 Only that the knife will lead me.     
 I'm assuming you know this symbol.     
 It is the sign of the worst existential nightmare.     
 - The ultimate hell. The... 
- You're doing it again.     
 Focus. What does it mean?     
 That symbol represents what you say has happened to me.     
 It means no one remembers you.     
 No one celebrates you.     
 No one mourns you.     
 Loosely translated,     
 it means "permanent death."     
 [DIAL TONE BUZZES]     
 ALARIC: That's not a good idea.     
 I need to call my mom.     
 I thought I asked you not to leave her alone.     
 She was cold. I got her some tea.     
 Oh.     
 Cassie,     
 this situation... I'm afraid it might not be permanent,     
 and I don't know how fair it would be to your mother     
 right now to hear your voice.     
 So you think I'm gonna die again?     
 I think it's likely.     
 I'm sorry.     
 I understand that this is...     
 an emotional experience for everyone involved.     
 And I will be here every step of the way.     
 Is there anything I can get you?     
 I'm hungry. I need a shower.     
 That's not a problem.     
 And then I'd like to get to the bottom of how you murdered me.     
 HOPE:  Do you remember how you died?   
 I was wandering the beach of Normandy     
 in need of a pick-me-up, so I thought     
 I'd resurrect a few G.I.s to toy with some Nazis.     
 I'm glad to hear even evil creatures don't like Nazis.     
 Nobody likes Nazis.     
 One minute,     
 I'm dancing with the dead on the sand,     
 and the next, there was just blackness.     
 But you don't remember who killed you?     
 No, although that's not uncommon.     
 The subconscious     
 has a way of protecting the mind against the trauma of death.     
 I see it all the time in my line of work.     
 But theoretically, that memory still exists.     
 Right? What if there was a way to access it?     
 You want to take a walk through my subconscious?     
 [LAUGHS]: Oh, oh, oh.     
 Well,     
 at your own peril, my dear.     
 'Cause I'm not sure you're quite tall enough     
 to ride the scary rides, huh?     
 I assume you've got a powerful vampire handy?     
 Absolutely.     
 [GRUNTS]     
 Come on, push it out.     
 - Come on, man. 
- It's too much.     
 Not nearly enough.     
 It's them weak-ass bunny blood muscles talking.     
 Ain't got nothing to do with bunny blood.     
 It's just heavy.     
 Oh, yeah?     
 Hmm.     
 I was on a hunger strike     
 for four days and can still smoke that skinny ass.     
 [CHUCKLES] Think about that.     
 MG? Do you know how to do a head dive?     
 Is that a thing?     
 It is, it just takes a little, um, precision.     
 I don't know. I mean, you might want to get Kaleb.     
 Kaleb's not on our Avengers squad, now is he?     
 Here. But not a word of this to Dr. Saltzman.     
 It's for Cassie,     
 when she's done in the shower.     
 Thanks.     
 You doing okay?     
 - My head keeps spinning. 
- Yeah.     
 Well, I wish there was something I could say to help,     
 but having just been through this myself,     
 I'm not sure my head will ever stop spinning.     
 She thinks that I killed her.     
 Technically, you did.     
 It was an accident.     
 Doesn't make her any less dead.     
 [SIGHS]     
 This guy that brought her back,     
 do you think that we can convince him to let her stay?     
 I'd like to help you out,     
 but as soon as I can figure out how to kill him,     
 he's out of here, and likely, her along with him.     
 But then another monster will come,     
 and what if it's worse than this one?     
 Don't you think we should at least think about keeping     
 - him around? 
- I would rather spend     
 a lifetime slaying dragons     
 than have another kid at this school     
 go through what you and I have just experienced     
 at the hands of this creature.     
 Look, the only advice     
 I can offer you is to find closure.     
 When someone is taken from us too soon,     
 it can haunt us forever.     
 Use this time well.     
 Make your peace with her.     
 MG: It's so cold. It's like compulsion,     
 but while I'm on the surface of his mind,     
 heroic-like, I'm plunging you into the deep end...     
 Holy Mary, mother of demons.     
 Hello, Milton.     
 Your great-nana Imogene is waving hello     
 just over your shoulder.     
 You can see my great-nana?     
 Oh, I can see everything.     
 She's most disappointed in you for forsaking Jesus,     
 who I can also see, but, oh, I know,     
 that's another can of worms.     
 Shall we begin?     
 Uh...     
 We're going in there?     
 - With him? 
- With me,     
 - The Almighty Necro... 
- HOPE: Please.     
 Can we not do all that again?     
 Did you steal them keys from Dr. Saltzman?     
 - Yeah, I did. 
- Oh, boy.     
 MG, pull it together.     
 You have no reason to fear me,     
 I assure you.     
 You're basically the Grim Reaper.     
 Oh, the Reaper is a carnival sideshow hack!     
 No, you... you dirty your mouth     
 mentioning his name in my presence.     
 Perhaps I should summon Nana to wash it out with soap?     
 No, you leave my Nana be.     
 Don't nobody need to be whupped by Nana right now.     
 Okay. I stand here,     
 hands on his shoulders.     
 - Ooh. 
- Now, you and I     
 join hands.     
 [JOINTS CRACKING]     
 [EXHALES]     
 Now I look into your eyes.     
 Open your mind to me.     
 Like, lifting a window to let the breeze in.     
 [JAZZ MUSIC PLAYING]     
 I'll be damned. [LAUGHS]     
 I mean, I'm obviously damned, but it worked.     
 What the hell are we doing here?     
 You are the one who invited yourself along.     
 Here.  This restaurant is in New Orleans.     
 I've spent half my childhood here.     
 Yes.     
 Rousseau's.     
 I spent a good amount of time here     
 before the     s.     
 Your father was good     
 for my business, always killing people.     
 How do you know about my dad?     
 Well, he's standing right behind you.     
 [LAUGHS]     
 Kidding. Kidding.     
 But his spirit is all around you.     
 Plus, he and I did     
 our fair share of drinking here     
 when he was at his most murdery.     
 Are you messing with me right now?     
 Frankly, I think  you're  the one     
 messing with me.     
 All this talk about     
 solving the mystery of Malivore.     
 I think you and I both know     
 which mystery you'd love me to solve.     
 You want to know how your dad is.     
 Or should I say, where he is? Huh?     
 No. No, I don't.     
 Sure you do.     
 You want to know if he's at peace or if he's suffering.     
 Regretting his sacrifice.     
 After all, he did die to save your life.     
 A lovely gesture     
 for such a mercurial man.     
 Hmm. Not to bother.     
 I'm not telling you anything     
 until we've finished our journey.     
 Now, let's get started, shall we?     
 This is my conscious mind.     
 We need to find the door to my subconscious.     
 Look for a hallway to nowhere,     
 an endless staircase. Something like that.     
 [LIVELY MUSIC PLAYING]

 How I love the macabre!     
 Oh, oh, the dance of death.     
 I wonder, who's the guest of honor?     
 Let's take a look.     
 Perhaps,     
 Klaus Mikaelson?     
 No!     
 There's nothing there.     
 You're not ready for the truth.     
 No, like, literally, nothing.     
 Hmm?     
 Ah, clever girl.     
 May I present the door to my subconscious?     
 Well done, you.     
 I'm glad that's over. I'm shaking,     
 - my hands are sweaty, I... 
- Unbelievable.     
 He ditched me.

 I'm not that good at this.     
 You'll be fine. If he's going in search of answers,

 I just wanted you to be honest with yourself about it.     
 RAFAEL: When I first got here to the school,     
 uh, they told me that     
 a lot of guys with my condition, they...     
 have a lot of anger that eats at them.     
 But I'm better now that I know what was causing it.     
 Oh, yeah?     
 Then what was causing it earlier today?     
 I knew that you'd never hurt me,     
 but that didn't mean you didn't scare me sometimes.

 Dr. Saltzman.     
 I screwed up.     
 Hope's in trouble, and I can't help her.     
 [CRYING]: Why are you doing this to me?     
 [WORDS ECHOING]     
 Okay, fine. Yes.     
 I want to know about my dad.     
 My family said that he must have died with love in his heart     
 and that he should've found peace.     
 But how am I supposed to know if that's true?     
 I need to know that he's not alone.     
 Because I can't live with myself if he is alone.     
 No one should ever have to be alone like this.     
 Please.     
 [FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING]     
 
 
 
 - Oh, hey. 
- Don't "hey" me.     
 Get me out of here.     
 With pleasure.     
 [GASPS]     
 Oops.     
 [LAUGHS]     
 Daddy's home.     
 - Hey. 
- What's up?     
 What's up?     
 If I'm gonna be a vampire, I need to be strong enough     
 to handle everything that comes along with it.     
 People get hurt     
 if I'm weak.     
 So feed me blood.     
 Feed me whatever it takes.     
 Hallelujah.     
 The Prodigal Son has returned.     
 I mean, how could you be so reckless?     
 You weren't getting anywhere.     
 And so you took it upon yourself?     
 - And how did that go? 
- Not well.     
 Yeah? Well, I have it under control, Hope.     
 Oh, really?     
 Then you want to explain this?     
 Or this?     
 Or anything else that would explain     
 your utter lack of progress?     
 I am grieving, Hope.     
 And maybe you should try that sometime     
 instead of pushing everyone away.     
 - [LAUGHS SOFTLY] 
- Look, I am trying     
 to protect you.     
 That thing is a master manipulator.     
 It resurrected my fiancée,     
 it raised a cemetery of zombies     
 and it brought back Rafael's dead girlfriend, so let's just     
 talk about the ways in which it could torment you,     
 starting with your dead mother, ending with your dead father,     
 and how about all the ghosts of all the people     
 that you killed in between, huh?     
 - I can't believe you'd do this. 
- Don't do that.     
 You don't like that I broke your rules     
 as a headmaster? Fine, punish me.     
 But don't you dare play disappointed dad,     
 - because you are not my father. 
- Oh, I know that.     
 - And where are you doing? 
- To finish what I started.     
 Like hell you are.     
 -  Cloditay. 
- Hope...     
 Hope!     
 [FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING]     
 Back for more?     
 Tell me where my father is.     
 I will tell you everything you want to know,     
 but wouldn't you like to hear about     
 what I've just learned of Malivore first?     
 [BELL RINGING]     
 [PHONE RINGING]     
 It's my day off, Ric. 
We talked about this.     
 Hope has sealed me in my office and I need to get out.     
 Just wait till the spell wears off.     
 She's trying to negotiate with The Necromancer.     
 Ric. I'm off the clock. 
This is the only day     
 I take off all year. 
I'll talk to you tomorrow.     
 KALEB: All right.     
 We're in Vegas and this here is the all you can eat buffet.     
 All right? We got the omelet station right here.     
 That there is the seafood tower.     
 Chocolate fountain.     
 [KALEB LAUGHS]     
 After I left you, I returned to the scene of my death.     
 I saw a shadow. I felt a searing pain.     
 And when I looked down, there was a knife in my heart     
 and emptiness all around me.     
 A knife?     
 The  knife.     
 Interestingly enough,     
 that which I seek is that which did me in.     
 You've got to understand,     
 to be killed by such a trifle of an object...     
 I was curious as to its power,     
 so I jumped out of     
 my subconscious and summoned the spirit of the man     
 who forged the knife in the first place.     
 You left me in there on purpose?     
 Oh, I had work to do, and you had lessons to learn.     
 From this man,     
 I heard the remarkable story     
 of Malivore,     
 created to wipe the scourge of the supernatural     
 off the face of this Earth.     
 Malivore consumed us, erased us.     
 It  was  permanent death.     
 And it was in Malivore that we were left to perish.     
 Until recently,     
 when the knife started beckoning us to bring it home.     
 But why a knife?     
 Decades ago, Malivore was contained.     
 Three locks created to seal Malivore shut.     
 The knife is one of those locks.     
 When all three locks return home,     
 Malivore is free to open its jaws of death once again.     
 [QUIETLY]: What does that even mean?     
 Oh, my dear...     
 ...let's just hope you're not still alive to find out.     
 Okay, young grasshopper.     
 It's called Snatch,     
 Eat, Erase. All right?     
 I read about it in Dr. Saltzman's books about     
 those Salvatore dudes that used to live in our school.     
 I-I feel bad.     
 Don't feel bad, brother. 
They're food, okay?     
 It's like eating a burger. You feel bad     
 - about the cow? 
- Sometimes.     
 Lizzie went through this vegan phase, and she...     
 just got me thinking.     
 [CRUNCHING]     
 [KALEB GROWLING]     
 [CHUCKLES]     
 Delishes.     
 Come on.     
 Yeah. There you go.     
 Oh!     
 All right.     
 Easy, killer. Okay.     
 Slow down, buddy. That's enough.     
 MG, dude's no that big, okay? That's enough.     
 MG, okay, calm down.     
 MG! Get back...     
 [THUNKS]     
 So let me get this straight.     
 You left me inside your freaky twisted mindscape     
 so you could... what? Stall me?     
 My apologies for the melodrama,     
 but I needed to buy meself some time.     
 To talk to some dead knife maker.     
 That,     
 and to retrieve the knife     
 your friend Dorian had hidden behind the stacks     
 in the library.     
 What?     
 Because while you were trapped     
 in just a small semblance of the blackness I suffered,     
 experiencing just an ounce of my agony,   
 I was busy doing what I do best:   
 controlling the dead.   
 HOPE:  I don't understand.   
 NECROMANCER:  The answer, my darling, is yes.   
 I was stalling you.     
 Just as I'm stalling you now.     
 Now leave me alone for a few minutes.     
 I want to stand in the sun.     
 NECROMANCER:  Did you know   
 that there's a lot of Bennett witches   
 buried in the local cemetery that excel in the art   
 of mystical transportation?   
 I summoned a little help to ensure the knife   
 returned to Malivore quickly and without incident.     
 [CHANTING IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE]     
 [NECROMANCER LAUGHING]   
 Oh, my God.     
 Come on, look on the bright side.     
 You can get back to the daily grind of your young life.     
 And in moments,     
 when the knife is returned to Malivore,     
 I will be free to find peace.     
 As for your father,     
 he watches over you every day.     
 He did die with love in his heart,     
 and he doesn't regret his choice.     
 But he won't find peace...     
 ...until you do.     
 Eh, good luck with that.     
 [CHUCKLES]     
 [RUMBLING]     
 The knife is destroyed.     
 One lock is released.     
 And with it, so am I.     
 [PANTING]     
 [BOTTLES CLINKING]     
 What the hell is wrong with you?     
 Man, we were just having a little fun.     
 Fun? By feeding on human blood?     
 Man, don't think we don't know that all you feed us     
 at school is that bunny blood.     
 That's not being a real vamp.     
 You talk a real big game about shaping young minds,     
 but you ain't even letting us be who we really are.     
 Do you know why I was at the cemetery today?     
 Why I take this day off... 
Only this day off... every year?     
 It's because I am honoring my father     
 and my little sister, both of whom were murdered     
 by the very vampire whose memorial library     
 we are standing in right now.     
 The place I come to work every day.     
     days a year, I love my job,     
 but one day out of the year, I cannot stand     
 the sight of this place.     
 Do you even know what a Ripper is?     
 Do you?     
 A Ripper is a vampire who is driven by obsession,     
 who lives only for the gratification     
 of their deepest desires.     
 A Ripper will feed until there is nothing left to feed on,     
 and then they'll move on to the next, and the next.     
 And do you know what kind of vamps are susceptible     
 to being Rippers?     
 If I was taking bets, I'd say an impressionable,     
 obsessive, clinically ADHD, horny little kid     
 like Milton Greasley.     
 HOPE:  Dear Dad, I'm no stranger to death,   
 but that doesn't mean I want to talk about it.   
 Once a year, for Remembrance Day,   
 we're asked to write letters to our lost loved ones.   
 We sign our names, fold them up   
 and scatter them throughout the cemetery.   
 I usually don't see the point in it.   
 Why write to the dead?

 Apparently,     
 I was too busy launching phase one of Mali-pocalypse.     
 It's okay.     
 Dr. Saltzman, he... he had my back.     
 [QUIETLY]: Oh...     
 He still mad at you, huh?     
 He's probably gonna be mad at me for a while.     
 Yeah, well, at least with the knife gone,     
 maybe we can finally get some quiet around here.     
 [LAUGHS SOFTLY] I wonder if that's possible.     
 What's wrong?     
 Landon's in trouble.
