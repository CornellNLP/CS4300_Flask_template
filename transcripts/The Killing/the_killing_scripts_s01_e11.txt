 Yeah...Two to one. 
 Yes, sir... 
 I'm not sure what Rosie Larsen would be doing in a place like this. 
 I don't allow minors into my establishment, Detective...? Linden. 
 Maybe she used a fake I.D. 
 I'll need to talk to all of your employees who were working that weekend. 
 I was running the floor, and I didn't see her. 
 Well, maybe somebody else did. 
 Doubt it. 
 I was on the floor all Friday night. 
 Did I say that Rosie Larsen was here on Friday? 
 We follow the news coverage, Ms. drays included. 
 We know the girl went missing then. 
 I noticed that you have security cameras on your floor. 
 I'd like to take a look at the footage. 
 Our tapes get erased every 24 hours, so, unfortunately, they won't be of much use to you. 
 Then I'll start with your customers. 
 Detective... 
 I'm sure you're aware, my customers don't exactly welcome a police presence in their playground. 
 Well, I can chat with them here, or I can drag them down, one by one, to police headquarters. 
 Which do  you  think they'd prefer? 
 I'm sure you're also aware that Wapi Eagle Casino sits on Indian land. 
 As such... 
 We're not under city, state, or county jurisdiction. 
 Now, unless you have a federal warrant... 
 Get the h--- off my property. 
 Thanks. I'm sure you needed the backup. 
 I need to talk to A.D.A. Bernstein. 
 This is Detective Linden. 
 Yes, I'll hold. 
 Hey, Ronald, listen, what kind of search warrant do you have to file to get into an Indian casino? 
 A week? You got to be kidding me. 
 Hey... 
 Casinos don't own the ATMS on their property, right? 
 The banks or credit unions do. 
 I'm gonna need a warrant... 
 For Landsing bank, for all the ATMS they operate at the Wapi Eagle Casino and lodge. 
 I clocked four ATMS inside. There are probably more. 
 Cameras on them could have caught Rosie on the floor. 
 Yeah, if she was taking out cash, right? 
 And  if she was even here that night. 
 Rosie took the last boat in Friday night -- 11:45 ferry. 
 No ferries after that. No way to get back off the island. 
 Yeah, but we got no time of death. 
 So she could've come back to the city on the ferry the next day. 
 Unless she met her killer here. 
 We didn't find the burner phone or the backpack on the body, right? 
 So the perp's got them, or they're still out there somewhere. 
 Or they're inside. 
 We know that she came here. 
 She had that -- that keychain with the bird emblem, right? 
 Then there's all of her missing time at night and after school. 
 It's got something to do with this place. 
 And the casino owner ain't sharing? 
 No, she and her human pitbull are circling the wagons. 
 Plus she heads up the kulamish tribe, which owns all of these lands, so there's no need. 
 Bernstein? Yeah, I'll hold. 
 We're not waiting to go in there. 
 Indian tribal courts in d.C. Has got to review it first. 
 It could take up to a week. 
 How long we got to wait for the bank warrant? 
 Bernstein said it could take at least 24 hours, but he's hoping for better. 
 What? 
 You got somewhere to be? 
 No. Why? 
 'Cause if you do, I've got this covered. 
 I'm here, ain't I? 
 D---, is there one or two days a month you're  not  pms'ing? 
 You've reached Liz and... 
 Kayla and... 
 Davie! 
 We're not home, so leave a message. 
 Holla atcha later, habibi. 
 Yo, little man "d." 
 D---, you sound grown. 
 And you, too, Kayla. 
 So -- so, Liz, um... 
 Y-you want me to bring whatnot to the school parade -- you know, soda, chips, or whatever -- you just let me know, and -- and I-I got it. 
 Uh, and, davie, uh... 
 I got something for you... 
 From y-your birthday I missed. 
 So, a-and anyways, you know, um, come find me, okay? 
 I'm gonna be out there in the crowd, hollerin' atcha, habibi. 
 All right. Later. 
 Yeah. Okay. Thanks. 
 Let's head back. 
 That the d.A.? 
 It was Jack's school. 
 He didn't show up this morning. 
 He hasn't been at school in the last three days. 
 Park yourself at the courthouse. 
 I'll let Oakes know about the casino. 
 What happened to the boat? 
 I'll meet you there. 
 Hey, go easy on the kid. I mean, look at this dump. 
 No wonder he went awol. 
 Nice try, Jack. 
 What happened? 
 I told you to go to the courthouse! What did Jack say? 
 He's not there. 
 Get in, Linden. It's raining. 
 He's probably just at Regi's at the marina. 
 And you ain't takin' a bus there. 
 Get in already! 
 Hi, Regi. 
 Look, I'm sorry to bother you, but I need to know if Jack is with you or if you've heard from him. 
 Call me. Thanks. 
 It's Jack's. He left it in the room. 
 Don't be calling his friends. 
 I mean, that's the last thing he needs now is his moms crazy dialing. 
 It's got a passcode. 
 D--- it. 
 So, why you staying at a motel? 
 Regi finally boot you out? 
 Looks like it, doesn't it? 
 So, Regi's Jack's dad? 
 Regi's a she. 
 Ohh. She your moms? 
 Why you call your moms by her first name? 
 Take a right here. I know. I been here before, Linden. 
 Then you got to move over, holder. 
 W-- I am. I am. D---! 
 See, me and my moms, it's like... 
 "See you when I see you." 
 But Liz, my sister... 
 I mean, she's the one that really raised me. 
 I-it sounds like you and Regi don't get along too good neither, huh? 
 Attempted abduction of a minor at clearview elementary at the corner of Jones and Fairview. 
 Suspect's in a green Toyota Tercel. 
 License-plate number RVZ-4897. 
 Hi, Anna. It's Sarah linden calling, Jack's mom. 
 Look, I know this is kind of a strange question, but I was wondering if Jack might be hanging out at your house with Nash. 
 Um, could you call me, please? Thank you. 
 It's Jack's best friend. 
 So, why'd your moms kick you out of her canoe? 
 Take a right here. The slip's down the next dock. 
 I'll be back. Wait here. 
 Hey -- I'll wait here. Don't worry about me, Linden. 
 Limo's ready whenever you are. 
 Yo, where's the boat? 
 Hi, Anna. It's Sarah again. 
 Please call me as soon as you get this. 
 Thanks. 
 Where's Regi at? 
 San Juan islands. 
 Won't be back till next Friday. 
 Neighbor said she left this morning. 
 So maybe Jack went with her. 
 She wouldn't just take him and not tell me. 
 You know, people do crazy--- thing, you know? 
 Linden here. 
 Hi, it's Anna. I got your messages. 
 Hi, Anna. Thanks so much for calling me back. 
 Um, sorry to bug you, but I got a call from the school. 
 They said Jack wasn't there, and I thought that maybe he and Nash were together? 
 No, I'm sorry, I haven't seen Jack all day. 
 And I've actually been meaning to call you about him. 
 Okay. What is it? 
 I caught Nash cutting class the other day, down near the waterfront with a bunch of boys, at this place called the tunnel. 
 Apparently, Jack's their ringleader, encouraging them to do this kind of stuff. 
 Look, I'm sorry that Jack is involved, but these kids are making bad decisions, too. 
 It's not just my son. 
 Sarah, I don't want to fight. 
 I understand you're going through some...Things. 
 Look, I just don't want my son to hang out with Jack anymore. 
 I'm sorry. 
 I appreciate your candor. 
 Bye, Sarah. 
 Do you know any spots near the waterfront where kids would hang out? 
 Some place called the tunnel? 
 Yeah. 
 I'll take you. 
 Let me have the keys. I'll drive. 
 You drive too slow, holder. Give them to me. 
 "Hey, thanks for staying, Stephen." 
 "Hey, you're welcome, Sarah. 
 You know, that's what friends are for, yo." 
 I mean, I skipped out of school all the time when I was his age. 
 He'll turn up. 
 What is this place? 
 It's hooky central for the middle-school set. 
 Smoking cigs, making out -- you know, small-time. 
 What about Mr. Sonoma? 
 Maybe Jack called him, told him where he was going. 
 No, I don't think so. 
 What about his real dad? 
 They still tight? 
 Holder, enough with the 20 questions. 
 Why'd  you  run off? 
 Used to think it was -- 
I don't know -- 
 'cause I was mistreated, p----- off, "poor me," blah blah blah, but... 
 Sometimes I think you just run away just so someone will come looking for you. 
 Staying put is a kind of running away. 
 You know what I'm saying? 
 I usually have no idea, and this time is no different. 
 Sonoma? 
 Come on. 
 You are a true sage... 
 Real astute observer of human nature. 
 You ever think of writing a book? 
 I did. It's called... 
 "How to be me." 
 I'll get my peeps to send you a signed copy. 
 I'm sure it gave Deepak chopra a run for his money. 
 Oh, snap! 
 Linden's making a joke! 
 Do you mind? 
 What -- do -- do you want one? 
 If you got somewhere to go, I can get a cab back to the station. 
 Nah. I'm good for now. 
 You know someone who's sick? 
 Nah, it's -- 
I-I got a date. 
 A date? 
 You might want to get rid of that balloon, then. 
 Yeah, yeah. I-I was gonna do that. 
 What? It cost like 20 bucks. 
 I never would have guessed. 
 Whatever. 
 It's the gesture that counts. 
 You ladies dig this kind of thing. Admit it. 
 Admit it! 
 So, go. Get laid. 
 I'll find a ride. 
 She can wait. 
 I mean, who  wouldn't  wait for this slice of heaven? 
 Jack! 
 Jack! 
 Do you know Jack Linden? 
 Any of you? 
 Do you go to Waverly middle school? 
 What's it to you? 
 Hey, you watch your mouth, son. 
 Let's get out of here, Linden. These kids are punks. 
 Crazy b----. 
 What did you say to me? 
 I said... 
 B----, be gone. 
 You want to go to Juvie until you're 18 years old, you keep mouthing off like that! 
 Linden, chill. 
 Chill. 
 I'm gonna call the cops, freaks. 
 Hey, we  are  the cops, ---wipe. 
 Yo. 
 Maybe he's back at the motel. We should head back. 
 He's not. I called. 
 You want to bet your moms took him with her on her boat? 
 Regi didn't take him, holder. 
 You know, moms be doing crazy--- things, you know? 
 They think they know best, and -- she's not my mother. 
 Then, who is she, your spinster aunt or what? 
 She's my social worker, okay? 
 I've known her my whole life. 
 So she wouldn't take my kid and not tell me. 
 He knows he's got to call at 3:15... 
 After school, from the motel. 
 He'll call. 
 We should get some food. 
 All right, give me a double-cheese filet-o-fish, two large fries, a hamburger -- extra Mayo, and hold the Patty. 
 Hold the what? 
 The Patty. The meat. 
 You want a hamburger without the meat? 
 That's what I said, ain't it? 
 I'll take a coffee, black. 
 What's the point? 
 I'm a vegetarian. 
 Who eats pork rinds? 
 That'll be $19.46. 
 Pork rinds are junk food. Don't count. 
 No. I got it. 
 Uh... 
 You can't be a vegetarian and eat meat. 
 It doesn't make sense. 
 Everything makes sense. Depends on how you  perceive  it. 
 Oh, yes -- 
 "perception is circumstantial." 
 I didn't forget that nugget. 
 Let me break it down for you. 
 Can't wait. 
 My body's my temple, right? 
 But here... 
 Is the control tower. 
 See, people be wanting to put everything in a box, get spoon-fed the answers, you know, make everything black-and-white. 
 But me... 
 ...I see the grays. 
 Is Jesus Christ your savior, holder? 
 Ha ha. Mm. 
 Seriously. What's with the tat? 
 J.C., Buddha, lactose-ovo vegetarianism -- 
 I mean, it all -- look, wisdom's all around, Linden. 
 It's like air. You just got to breathe it. 
 Did you get the tat when you got clean? 
 A month in. 
 I got hooked on the job. 
 Undercover. It makes sense. You got to blend in. 
 No. No, no, no. 
 Nobody put that pipe in my mouth except me. 
 Truth is... I  love  meth. 
 Love  that kristy. 
 It's the best little lady I ever had. 
 So, why'd you break up with her? 
 My l.T. Found out. 
 Said he'd boot me out of county if I didn't quit, so here I am. 
 Happy, joyous, and free. 
 I finally let go, you know? 
 Let go? 
 Of thinking that I had any sort of control, that I ain't the one in the driver's seat. 
 Then who is? 
 Please don't say God. 
 I mean, whatever you want to call it -- more powerful than this tweakhead. 
 Good for you. 
 It does not apply elsewhere in life, but I'm glad that you got clean. 
 We make choices to fix our mistakes or we don't. 
 You did. 
 And if you want to credit that to Christ or that hamburger, you made it. 
 Yeah. 
 Some things you -- you  can't  fix. 
 Maybe they just stay broke. 
 Right. 
 Let the bad guys do their thing. 
 Screw it. Let's take our pension and run. 
 What the h--- are  we  doing here? 
 
 
 
 Last real job you had... 
 Was the Picasso, right? 
 The kid who drew those trees? 
 Yeah, I did my research, Linden. 
 You never told me what happened to him. 
 Got the guy who killed his mother. So what? 
 No, what happened to the  kid,  Linden? 
 His dad was the doer. Mom is dead. 
 I put the dad in 20 to life, so... 
 The kid didn't have anywhere to go. 
 Child protective services took him. 
 He's still in the system, last I heard, and he probably will be until he's 18. 
 Nobody's gonna adopt him. 
 He's damaged goods. 
 That's what happened to the kid. 
 Are you done yet? 
 I got to go to the bathroom. 
 Hey, I got into his phone. 
 What? How? 
 Figured out his password. 
 "Funyuns." 
 I mean, I ain't so bad, Linden. 
 I mean, the kid needs a role model in his life. 
 Well, I'm glad he has you since I clearly suck at the job. 
 Well, you ain't the worst out there. 
 Oh, thanks for that. 
 Boys need their fathers, you know? 
 Mr. Sonoma -- he ain't cutting it no more? 
 What is this? What? 
 These texts. 
 There's three of them since yesterday about meeting up with Jack. 
 "I'm parked at the corner of van dam and 7th." 
 That's right by Waverly, Jack's school. 
 Who sent them? 
 I don't know. It's a -- it's a restricted number. 
 It was sent at 7:00 this morning. 
 That's right when we left the motel. 
 He's thirteen years olds. 
 Well, I don't care about your privacy regulations! 
 72 hours?! I can't wait that long! 
 I-I need that -- that phone unblocked right now! 
 So, what'd the phone company say? 
 Nothing. Bull---! 
 Give me a cigarette. For real? 
 Just give it to me. 
 You get in touch with any of his friends? 
 No. 
 All the phones are bumping to voicemail. 
 T-they're probably in school, and they got their phones in the lockers or whatnot. 
 He knows better than that. He'd never get in the car with a stranger. 
 Yeah, of course not. 
 He's just been so angry with me. 
 I must have driven right past the guy. 
 I probably saw him. 
 It's Detective Sarah Linden. 
 I, um, I need an a.P.B. Out on a missing 13-year-old. 
 5'2½"... 
 117 pounds... 
 Brown hair, green eyes. 
 He knows he's got to be here at 3:30 on the dot. 
 I'll be out here if you need me. 
 You want to stay? 
 Wait for him? 
 I'm just gonna go make a call. 
 You've reached Liz and... 
 Kayla and... 
 Davie! 
 We're not home, so leave a message. 
 Holla atcha later, habibi. 
 Hey, Liz, um... 
 I-I'm not gonna be able to make it to the parade. 
 Uh... 
 Yeah, see, there's, uh... 
 There's this friend, and, uh... 
 She's in need, and... 
 I-I-it's kind of like an emergency, you know? 
 Or... 
 ...I-it  is  an emergency. 
 A-and... 
 Liz -- 
Liz, this ain't like before. 
 All right? This is for real. 
 A-and you know I wouldn't have missed this thing for anything in the world, but... 
 Liz, I... 
 I got to see this through. 
 You know, she -- she needs me, you know? 
 And... 
 And could you p-please tell little d that I-I'm comin' over later? 
 'Cause I still got something for him. 
 I-if that's ok. 
 P-please call and tell me if that's okay for me to come on by. 
 And -- 
 Is everything okay? 
 Yeah. 
 Thanks, holder. 
 For being my ride. 
 Yeah, well... 
 It ain't no thing. 
 What time is it? 
 5:10. 
 You want to go inside? 
 He's not there. 
 Let's go. 
 Uh, go down Mantura. You'll hit a one-way. Take a left. 
 And then avoid the bottleneck on Kennedy in front of the Dunkin' donuts. 
 You grow up around here? 
 9th grade to 11th. 
 Senior year in beacon hill... 
 Middle school in queen Anne before the yuppies moved in... 
 And six months in northgate -- 
2nd grade. 
 They all foster homes? 
 You know what the worst thing was? 
 Bedrooms. 
 Not knowing where the window was, the door... 
 The light switch. 
 That d--- thing was always in a different place. 
 What happened to your moms? 
 She left when I was 5. 
 I was a ward of the state till I graduated high school. 
 So no wonder you ain't a pro. 
 Uh, being a moms, I mean. 
 Wow. You're a real d--- sometimes, you know that? 
 What? What? I-I'm just saying you didn't have the blueprint. 
 You know? 
 It's like cats. 
 You know, I-if they don't get raised by their moms, they don't learn how to bury their caca right. 
 You know -- what? It's true. 
 What? You -- you -- y-you want a smoke o-or something? W-what? 
 He called you. 
 Jack. Two days ago. 
 Yeah. Yeah, but h-he was trying to reach you. 
 But you weren't picking up. So what? 
 And you didn't bother to tell me? 
 He was wondering if you boil hot dogs or fry them. 
 You weren't around. Regi wasn't around. 
 What's the big deal? 
 So he went to the vegetarian Jesus freak for cooking advice? 
 Yeah. Whatever. 
 I  picked up my phone. 
 Excuse me? 
 I picked up my phone. 
 Stop the car. 
 What? I don't need you carting me around. Let me out. 
 Quit acting crazy. Stop the d--- car! 
 Get in the car, Linden. 
 Come on. Get in the car. 
 You're an ---hole! Yeah, well, so are you! 
 You don't know anything about me or my son or anything! 
 I know I don't. 
 Get in the car, Linden! 
 I-I'm sorry. 
 Please  get in the car. 
 Where to, boss? 
 What are we doing here? 
 I used to bring him here when he was little. 
 On weekends, when I was off, I would watch him go down that slide over and over for hours. 
 There was this one night. 
 We got here late. It was almost dark. 
 All the other kids had gone home. 
 And there was this song playing. 
 Somebody brought a radio out to the park. 
 What was that song? 
 ♪ Hmm, I got your love ♪ 
♪ and I got... ♪ 
 Some song that he loved. 
 And we just started dancing. 
 There we were, the two of us, dancing like fools, not caring if anybody saw. 
 I don't know when that changed... 
 ...Jack being happy. 
 But he was. 
 I know he was, that night, right here. 
 My son was happy. 
 CS Unit needed down at 3012 leverage street. 
 Body of an unidentified Caucasian male -- 
 10 to 13 years of age, 5'3", 110 pounds, brown hair. 
 Coroner's en route. 
 We need two more units on scene. 
 It's not him. 
 3012 leverage street. 
 You don't need to be there. Go. Please. 
 Where is he? Linden! 
 Detective Linden? You the catching Detective? Where is he?! 
 Don't let her through! Get away from me! Don't let her -- 
 Linden, st-- let's get back to the car. 
 I just need to see him. No, you don't need to see. 
 Come on, get back in -- get off of me! 
 It's not him, Linden! Jack! 
 It's not him! Jack! 
 Jack! Ugh! Let me go! 
 We've got an I.D. on John Doe. 
 Please stand by for an I.D. on the victim. 
 We've got positive identification on the victim as a one Daniel Mcclintock. 
 M-c-c-l-I-n-t-o-c-k. First name Daniel. 
 Address is 549 Hastings street, Aberdeen. 
 Parents en route. Stand by. 
 No. 
 Let's go. 
 Kick his ---. 
 No doubt. 
 Yeah? Holder. 
 Hey, holder, it's Bernstein. Warrant's signed. 
 ATM footage from the casino is en route to your office. 
 I'll be there. 
 Oh, yeah, let Linden know, will you? 
 She'll blow a gasket if she thinks I ducked her on this. 
 I hear that. Yeah, I will. 
 All right, later. 
 All right. Thanks. Bye. 
 I looked... 
 Everywhere for you today. 
 You have no idea what I went through. 
 Just tell me why. 
 Why what? 
 Why you've been lying to me. 
 I don't know. 
 Where were you today? 
 Promise you won't get mad? 
 I was with dad. 
 Yo, wait. Go back. 
 Pause.
