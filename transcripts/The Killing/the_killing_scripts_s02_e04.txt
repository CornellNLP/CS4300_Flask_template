 Previously on AMC's The Killing... 
 Stan was thick with the Kovarsky mob. 
 He didn't have a record. 
 That man don't press charges. 
 A son needs a father. 
 Jack has been doing just fine without a father so far. 
 Belko killed himself. 
 What happened to your mom's? 
 She left when I was five, I was a ward of the state 'til I graduate high school. 
 It may be time for me to move on. 
 I was thinking more DC. 
 It was in the mirror on Rosie's bike. 
 Canvass every camera within a four-block radius. 
 I looked into this Beau Soleil... 
 There's no record of Rosie. 
 Why drop the bag now, except to torture the Larsens? 
 Some kind of sick game? 
 Could be a sign of remorse. 
 Tattoo boy was driving Larsen's truck. 
 He knew Rosie. 
 They went biking together. 
 Then he's helping burn down Beau Soleil. 
 Whoever he is, he knows something. 
 She didn't have that much clothing. 
 Wherever she was going, it wasn't for more than a few days. 
 I need to get this bag tested. 
 I got this lab rat from my narc days. He's solid. 
 I'll drop it off to him on the DL, stay off of Carlson's radar. 
 What's this lab guy's name? 
 Linden, I thought the Richmond photo was legit. 
 Okay? 
 I mean, Gil saved my life. 
 I-I had like 10 days when I met him. 
 I was at a point I wasn't caring what I was putting in my skull, up my nose, down my throat. 
 I mean, I-I was at rock bottom, and he-- 
 I don't care. 
 We're in the middle of a sh1t storm because of you. 
 Guess I just trusted the wrong guy. 
 Yeah, I guess you did. 
 That's not Stan's boys. 
 They don't got the overalls. 
 Any of them our guy? 
 No. No tattoo. 
 Yo, that's Janek Kovarsky's joint. 
 So Stan Larsen is back with the mob? 
 I wonder if he knows his trucks helped cover up his daughter's murder. 
 Larsen moving and storage. 
 Yeah, this is him. What do you want? 
 What? Today? 
 No, no, you're not cremating him. 
 Well, I'll come pick him up, then. 
 I said I'm coming to get him. 
 Oh, God. 
 What's wrong, dad? 
 Hey, buddy. Nothing. Nothing's wrong. 
 What's up? 
 We need to get going, Tommy. 
 Look, this may come as a surprise to you, but your aunt Terry felt the same way about school. 
 It doesn't surprise me. 
 Now, that's called sarcasm. 
 Go to class, and you might find out what that means someday. 
 So giddyap. Let's go. 
 I'm gonna count to three, okay? 
 One... Two... 
 Get your shoes on and get out of the house now. 
 Larsen moving and storage. 
 Don't bother. I made other arrangements. 
 Now the cops want to send a car by. 
 You believe that? 
 Yeah. 
 So, Tommy's been like this for the past two days, not wanting to go to school. 
 Something's going on with him. 
 Well, I'll have to take care of it later, 'cause I got to go downtown to the... morgue. 
 It's about Belko? 
 They want to put him in a box and be done with him. 
 Hey, can you guys go downstairs? 
 I'll be down there in a minute. 
 I thought we were gonna be late. 
 Hey. Just go. 
 Where's Belko? 
 He was gonna take us to the zoo yesterday. 
 He's been sick. 
 Just go on down. Your aunt Terry will be right there. 
 There are unconfirmed reports it was allegedly a front maybe you should tell them. 
 For a prostitution ring known as Beau Soleil. 
 Police have also connected the premium escort service to the murder of local high-school teen Rosie Larsen. 
 The blaze is still under investigation, but the initial... Cops are saying Rosie was connected Yeah, but they were wrong, right? Look, I got to take the boys. Denny! Tommy! Guys? Help me! Help! Oh, my God. I'm coming. I'm coming. I'm right here. Help! I hate him! I hate him! Denny, are you okay? Oh, my God. Come on. Come on. It's okay. I hate you, Tommy! You suck! Tommy! What is wrong with you? Why would you do that to your brother? Why would you do that to your brother? Answer me! Why would you do that?! Answer me, would you?! Tommy, come on! Get off! Yore not my mom! Why don't you just go home?! Go home! I hate you! Tommy! I'm s... So, how do you know this FBI guy? He's a mob expert. Organized crime? That's not exactly your beat. Linden. Cory. Thanks for seeing us. Of course, of course. This is my partner, Detective Holder. You the big mob expert? For real? Can I have the picture, please? Our victim was with this guy. Had this tat. Suspected arson linked to Janek Kovarsky. Yeah, arson's a Janek special. He mixes some lighter fluid. It's next to impossible to trace. I don't recognize the tat, though. Could be a runner, new kid. Janek's pulling them off the street 24/7. I hear Stan Larsen used to work for Kovarsky, too. Has a body on him from back in the day. Yeah, early '90s. Janek was just small time then. He was running a card game out of the back of his Polish restaurant. Janek was trying to expand his operation into prostitution, protection, city contracting. Then he found out this other kid was skimming off his collections. Piotr Michaelski? Is that the guy Stan whacked? Well, we could never prove it, but word was that that was the price Larsen had to pay to get out. This Michaelski kid-- 
He have any family? Yes, his wife, Monica, found him. Hands bound, in the trunk of his car? Single shot to the head. Hey, there. I'm Josh, your OT. "O" for "occupational," 
"T" for "therapist." I'm here to teach you basic self-care-- Brushing your teeth, combing your hair, bathing, taking care of bodily functions. They write that little speech for you or you just come up with it all on your own? Pardon me? I've felt more empathy at the DMV. Why don't you come back after you've... worked on your delivery? Holder. Your badge. Monica? Seattle PD. We need a word. None of you gave a sh1t 17 years ago when Stan Larsen put a bullet in Piotr's head. Why you coming now? We're investigating the murder of his daughter, Rosie Larsen. Can't say I'll lose any sleep over that. Might rest better, even, knowing there's some justice in this world. Yeah, life's funny like that sometimes. I can think of another word for it. And yet here you are, counting our nut dishes, while the guy who iced your boyfriend is just living the good life, huh? You people saying I did it? Don't you got nothing better to do? Does Piotr have any family? His ma died young. He was an only child. Piotr got bounced around some, around the neighborhood, met up with Janek. You people should have arrested Stan. He used Piotr, killed him, stuck him in a trunk like he was trash. So, we got the nut collector playing bingo till 1:00 AM. I mean, no way that menthol-smoking bag of bones drags her sorry ass out in those woods after Rosie. Do you think? Mmm. Is that bacon? Nah. This is ham... eggs, and sausage. What happened to your whole lacto-ovo-vegan thing? Nothing. I'm just ready to embrace meat again. Hmm. Cory said Kovarsky was involved in city contracting. Might give us a link to the mayor. We should just call the mayor. I mean, if Cory's got that hookup, we could ask him who shot JFK, too. Maybe Rosie's BFF knows about tattoo boy. I mean, Sterling said that there was some old man in Rosie's life. Wasn't a teacher. Hmm, some street thug working for Janek Kovarsky-- That's got to be the last person... ...Stan wants her to be seeing. Linden. Is this Sarah Linden? Yes. Brian McCarthy. I represent Gregory Casher, Jack Linden's father. Is it true that you're planning to move your son to another state without informing him? I don't have to tell him or you anything. What is this? I am calling to let you know my client is suing for joint custody. On what basis? Your continued and consistent neglect and failure to meet your child's basic needs as a parent. Do you have representation, miss Linden? If not, I suggest you find it. You said Rosie was seeing someone in secret. Maybe. I mean, I don't know for sure. You ever see this? Uh, yeah. This guy was hanging outside Rosie's house, like, staring at her. He had that. Do you remember what he looked like? Tall, skinny, fat? Black, blue? White, I think. And, like, maybe 18? He was in a truck, so I didn't really see him that well. I didn't pay any attention to it. Guys were always trying to talk to Rosie. What was he doing outside of Rosie's house? I don't know. She talked to him for like a second, told him to get lost. When was this? Like, the end of school last year. Did you see him again? No. He really creeped Rosie out. Why? I think she said he'd been in prison or something. What else did she say about him? Nothing. I mean, that's it. She wasn't really saying stuff to me at that point, so... Well, if you think of anything else... How's Mrs. Larsen? Tell her I said hi, okay? Thanks, Sterling. Hello? Hey. It's me. I need your help. Is that your version of an apology? Can we just meet somewhere? If you want to meet in DC, sure. You don't waste any time. So... what, you just take a staff job? I'm headed into a meeting, Jamie. Right. The doctors need some info to help him recover quicker. God forbid the campaign come to an end while he heals. Hey, you left, all right? His sister's a no-show. This isn't about the campaign. You have 30 seconds. The doctors gave me a questionnaire to fill out. What's a typical morning like for Darren-- You know, waking up? Are you serious? I wouldn't ask if I didn't need it, all right? This is supposed to help him get on his feet, metaphorically speaking. Anything you can give me would really help. What sid does he usually sleep on? Whatever side I'm facing, he faces the other way. Okay, that's great. No preference. What's next? He sets the alarm for half an hour before he wakes up. Okay. And then when he finally does get up, he bangs around, opening drawers and... Looking for things. Looking for things like his... keys and... sunglasses... his watch. You know what? I'll figure it out. Thanks. Darren doesn't care about the little things in life, like daily routines. That stuff won't get him out of bed. What will? Being Darren Richmond again. I got to go. Picking up Jack's dinner? The warden approved this visit. What's the holdup? Hey, wake up, man. Benissimo Lee. We got it approved. All right, hold on a second. Linden, let's go. So, warden says you're giving out most of the tattoos in juvie hall, benissimo. How you figure, Columbo? Look, we don't care what you do in your rec time. We're just wondering if this is your work. Ogi Jun. Yeah, he a B. Lee special. So what? Who'd you do this for? Giffs. Giffs? What, we got to give you another zagnut to get his name? Don't know his real name. Giffs was in the family it. He's a foster kid? Hey. I snuck some goodies by the nurses. Cream puff? Don't worry. The filling's all liquid. Look, I-I, um-- I got this questionnaire from the guy. Jamie, Jamie, I need some air. I got to get out of here... now. Put me in the chair. Yeah, absolutely. Let me, uh-- 
Let me just call the guy. No, screw that. Right-- Right now. Um, okay. Uh, you and me? Yeah. Okay, yeah. Yeah, we-- We can do this. It's like the Cadillac of wheelchairs. Practically wheels itself. Your sister sent it. I could have told you Elyse would send money before she'd get on a plane. Okay, um... Uh, we got to-- We got to put you on me. You have to take me under the shoul-- Shoulders. I-- Right, right. Yeah, and then get me on your-- On my chest. Okay. All right, one, two, three. Oh! Come on. I'm trying. You're like twice my weight, so just try to relax. I'm the definition of relaxed. Okay. We could do this. We can do this. One, two, three. Ugh. Oh, God. This is good. This is good. No. No, no, no, no. This is not good. Lift. Lift. Lift me up. This is not good. Lift me up. I'm trying! I'm trying! Get me back on my bed. You're-- You're crushing me. Are you okay? Darren? 
 
 Alexi Giffords, AKA Giffs-- he's our tattoo boy. This is the DMV photo. 20 years old, Caucasian male. He's a foster kid. He spent 18 months in juvie after bolting from a home when he was 16. Kid's a runner-- He's been in 5 homes in 10 years. That's two years in each home. Yes. You catch a bad one, two years is a lifetime. Is this his juvenile record? Yeah. It's mostly petty stuff till he hooks up with Janek. Then we got him robbing, stealing, shaking down, just like Stan back in the day. Janek knows how to raise them. Check out the address. 224 Hanson Road. So what? That's three blocks from the Larsens'. Help you? Uh, yeah. Um... I'm here for Belko Royce. It's a family burial. Paperwork's all there. The funeral home picked him up. What? See? It's all been taken care of. Saved you a seat. Poor, dumb son of a bitch. Belko never had what you've got, Stan, like my own boy, Andre-- No discipline to take over the business. It should have been you, Stan. You wanted something different. I'm good with what I got. How's that working for you? Your daughter dies. Who pays to bury her, protect your boys? I appreciate all you've done for my family, but I will not-- 
They put you in prison. And Rosie's killer-- He's still out there. Give me your tired, your huddled masses-- You bought that  gówno. Poor man's never gonna sit at their table. When the heat turns up, we settle the score. Like Belko did? Like he died doing? Least he went out like a man. I got to go, figure out dinner for the boys. Speaking of, one of my guys saw your boy Tommy at school-- Kids beating on him, teasing him about his sister. Thought you should know. How was school? Yeah? That's great. He's good. I'm with him right now. Okay, I'll tell him. Listen, Jack, I got to go. Okay, bye. There's four units, no names on the mailboxes, nobody home. Let's go hit up the DCS for his foster file, see if he's got any relatives. No, you can't. Foster records are sealed. Only way we could get a look is if Alexi lets us. Yo, I got to piss. So, Rosie likes bad boys like her father. I don't buy that she knew about Stan's past. There's no way that he told her. It's in the DNA-- You know, the sins of the father and all that. Did you read that in  O Magazine? Mean, Alexi could have taken off for Alaska by now. He's not a runner. Two years in each home? That's plenty of time to figure out how, when, and where you're gonna bolt. So what is he? A planner. This isn't how either of us imagined this ending, Darren. Funny how life can turn on a dime. I'm not gonna waste my time or yours feeling sorry for you. You will come back from this. When you do, it'll only add to your appeal. And I want you to know... from the bottom of my heart... I'm gonna be pulling for you. My offer still stands. Four years from now, you got my full support. Won't that just ease your conscience? I've been wondering. What made the police so certain I killed that girl? They won't tell me. But I will find out. Offer still stands, Darren. You got a lot of nerve coming here. No need to be rude, Jamie. I'm just leaving. You ran a solid campaign, son. Gwen landed on her feet. I'm sure you will, too. So what's up with you and that fed? You and the tom waits wannabe ever hook up or what? Oh, snap. Linden rocked a booty call. Dial 1-900-Linden. That's not even enough numbers. That's pretty slick, Linden-- That candy-bar move in juvie. They trade them in there. It's like money. Did seem familiar. It was my first job I worked out of the academy. That right? Yeah. I thought you said you were a runner, back in the day, when you were in that foster home. I didn't say that. Yeah, you did. You said you bolted every six months. Well, makes sense, you know, with Sonoma and everything. What? I'm just making conversation since we're wasting our time here anyway. You're right. This is a waste of time. Get out. Come on, Linden. For real? What am I supposed to do out here? Your job. Call in for a car and keep your eyes open for Alexi. Hey, come on. Yeah, all right. Least we're back to normal. Tommy. Tommy! What are you doing here? I was driving by. How's it going? Those boys-- 
They saying stuff about Rosie? Hey. Come here those kids-- 
They're stupid, you hear? They don't know what they're saying. You hear me? Good. Now, next time one of them picks on you, what are you gonna do? I'm gonna walk away. No. I want you to hit him. The only way they'll learn. You pick the biggest guy, and hit him hard. You aim for the bridge of the nose, okay? You hear me? Hello? Who is this? Who is it? It's a wrong number. Jasper, come on. Dinner's ready. Hey, check this out. I was going through fan mail. Found this-- "Get well" card from George Washington Carver. That's the elementary school in Pigeon Point. Mrs. Cheever's fourth-grade class. God, I can't believe that old bag is still teaching. She looked like a mummy when I was there. Didn't we use her class to stuff envelopes for subsidized housing back in '02? I know what you're doing. It won't work. What am I doing? I want you to draft a statement. I'm withdrawing om the race. Yesterday, you said you wanted to-- I don't care what I said. Just do it. Okay. Let's talk about the speech. Statement. You'll be reading it. Whatever. I just want to be clear on what I'm telling them. I know that Councilman Richmond told you he'd fight for you, make sure old Lesley Adams didn't get four more years of free and clear access up your collective asses. But guess what, folks-- 
The councilman lied. Save the eloquence for your next candidate. Screw you. That's right. Let it out. Let's hear what really goes on up there. Do you know how many people believe in you-- Depend on you? I have spent the last 10 years of my life living out of my car, working 24/7, fighting for you. So put it on your résumé and get out. You're a coward. You're fired. You can't fire me if you're not running. Get a life, Jamie. I'm not it. Hey, I'm doing you a favor. Go on, go out, get laid for a change. Call Gwen. I hear she's available. You son of a bitch. So, where is home these days, Sarah? I'm covered. Uh, didn't answer the question. I said I'm good, Regi. You realize we've been having this conversation practically since you could speak. I'm nothing if not consistent. And how is Jack taking all this? He's fine. And how about you? Are you remembering to do things like eat and sleep? Regi, I'm here on business. Okay, then. I need the file on an ex-foster kid. His name's Alexi Giffords. Not gonna happen. Sorry. He's 20. He's an adult. It doesn't matter. Come on, Sarah. How would you like somebody poking around in your file? If it solved a murder, I'd be fine with it. Stan. What's this? You tell me. You said it was a dead end, that it had nothing to do with Rosie. I cleaned out Beau Soleil. So what? What did you do? What do you do to her? What do you do to Rosie?! You believe this guy? After 17 years, he comes here, asks for money, for my protection. And I give it, and what do I get? Accusations. What did you do to Rosie? I were you, I'd forget this business with Rosie. It's making you forget who's important in your life, like the children you still have. This is Detective Holder, badge number 4592. I'm calling in a 320. All units, request to locate a Caucasian male, early 20s, wearing a brown sweater, blue jeans, heading north on Hudson. You Regi's friend? Any trouble finding the place? No. I'm familiar with it. They changed the color of the balloons. They used to be red. They should give them to the kids who  don't  get adopted. Do you have Alexi's file? He came to me when he was 4. He was a sweet boy. He was one of the ones I thought was gonna make it. Mom abandoned him on the steps of a church. Teenage mom, unstable. Apartment four. Alexi Giffords. Alexi was in and out of foster homes. He was adopted by the Giffords family when he was 13. Stayed with them till he was 16. The situation imploded, and he ran away. The system caught him, threw him in juvenile hall. And that's around the time that I lost track of him. What about his biological father? Dad was killed when Alexi was little, around the time that his mom gave him up. So he wasn't born Alexi Giffords. That's his adoptive name. That's right. And what about his birth name? Michaelski. What? His birth mother is Monica Krol. His father's listed as-- Piotr Michaelski. You know who I am? You got what you deserved.
