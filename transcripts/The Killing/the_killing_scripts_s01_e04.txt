 Previously on AMC's The Killing... 
 Rosie Larsens' body was found in the trunk of a car stolen from this campaign. 
 By now most of you have heard what happened to Rosie. 
 Grief counselors will be... Sterling! 
 I did find this from a few days ago. 
 Leaking Yitanes' endorsement. 
 Don't I even get a chance to defend myself here? 
 You just did. 
 Screw both of you. 
 He was in the basement with Rosie? 
 Rosie's teacher confiscated a phone from a student earlier today. 
 They did it together. 
 Let me out of here, you bitch! 
 Let me out! 
 Let...Me...Out! You can't keep me in here. I know my rights. I didn't do anything to her! What do you want, huh? What? I didn't kill her, I swear. So, Rosie, senior year. Where you gonna be 10 years from now? Uh...Well, I mean, who knows what's gonna happen? Uh, today is all that matters, and, uh, I want... I don't know... um...I want to see everything, see the world. Uh... I am just so ready to start living, I guess. Was that okay? Tell her that. What? Tell her you didn't kill her. Look at her. Tell her. This kid's been here all night. He's jonesing... Ready to break. You think? Ames is in the waiting room with his lawyer. You're not gonna get much. It helps put the pressure on kris knowing his friend might want to cut a deal. You talking to him? Yeah. Holder will take the tweaker. Is it okay if I use your office? Ah. That junkie in there looks better than you do. Why don't you clean yourself up and put on a suit? Hey, your date's with me. We thought you'd be more comfortable with your father here, but it seems he wasn't able to make it. Mr. ames is currently out of the country. This is just a courtesy visit on our end. You can direct any questions you have to me. A video has come into our possession taken the night of Rosie Larsen's murder. She's in it. So's your client. What video? Mr. ames, please. Would you like to see it? As you can see, we have a wide selection to choose from. This lovely two-toned brushed-steel model boasts a white velvet interior in a French fold design, eternal rest adjustable bed, and matching pillow and throw. And all our caskets fit the standard 30-inch burial vaults. Burial vaults? Protection for your loved one against the outside weather elements... rain and so forth. The list price for these models begins at $2,000. Of course, there's always cremation... considerably less expensive... no. I understand. Then you'll want to consider a flower spray for the casket or perhaps wreaths for the church. That's a beautiful choice for a young girl. The list price is $3,800. We have reasonable payment plans, if that's your concern. No, we're set. Then I'll just need a nice dress for your daughter. You would like her in a nice dress, wouldn't you? I wish I had good news, but I don't. You're dropping fast across the board, losing traction with your key constituencies, even. Mayor's now got an 8-point lead, so, frankly, you're screwed. The Yitanes endorsement didn't stop the hemorrhaging? No, Adams is choking the airwaves, hammering you with that dead girl. But the car was stolen. We had nothing to do with it. Well, clearly, that message isn't getting through. What you need is a media blitz... ads, billboards. Yeah, we need to remind voters that you're the anti-crime guy and that Adams never gave a damn till now. Better hurry before he grabs up the airtime that's left. Well, then let's do it right now. With what money? Thank you, Michael. We need to go to Tom Drexler. No. He hates Adams. He hates politicians. He thinks we're all hand puppets for rich lunatics like him. I don't know. Maybe we are. Darren, he could be a good friend to us. How? I'm not making a deal with a guy whose patron Saint is Ayn Rand. You won't have to. All he cares about is screwing Adams. We help with that, we're golden. At least talk to him. We need someone with that kind of money right now. One thing Jamie was right about was using him. Get me my donors list. I'll start making phone calls after the committee meeting. Let me at that bitch. Give her to me. It's not what you think. Looks pretty clear to me. We didn't do anything to her, okay? My client doesn't need to answer any of your questions. You don't seem like the type that shares your toys. And that's what Rosie was, right? A toy? This is over. Let's go, Mr. ames. Wait, wait, I can explain. It's in your best interest not to... just shut up! It... it isn't what you think. Just turned 18. Ain't gonna be no comfy juvie digs for you. You're gonna be wearing a micro mini mini by the time you get out of adult pen. Jasper gets the hot chick, and I get you? Yeah. They know you got the itch like me? Damn. Boyfriend laid it on you. Jasper's crazy, okay? He hated Rosie. Yeah, you're just his wingman, right? Along for the ride? She always said hi. Rosie didn't treat me like I was... A rock-bottom junkie? What you gonna tell me next? You used to walk home together from school? You got a minute? I'm in the middle of something here, linden. I know. Let's go. Yo, I'll check you later, all right? Fine. Another movie? I want popcorn. Hey, you shut up, all right?! Yeah. Let me at that bitch. Give her to me. That's what you got? Man, you don't know sh1t. Hey, mayor. Jimmy. Say hello to your dad for me. Yes, sir. Hey, Al. Hey. Give me the usual. You got it. And get him another of whatever the hell he's drinking. Interesting choice in venue, mayor. This place and me go way back. Used to wait for my old man outside. Blackout drunk. Me, 9 years old, dragging his sorry a... back home. Spent a lot of hours looking at that, wanting more. I heard the story, mayor. I just don't understand why Seattle needs another yuppie mall. Not exactly a boon for the everyman. Screw the everyman. I'm the everyman. And that thing's gonna bear my name, be my legacy. Not bad for a poor kid from highland park. I hear you're from pigeon point. White trash... Just like you. Waterfront revitalization program. A vote for Adams is a vote for experience. Lesley Adams, a name you can trust. Look at that, hmm? This message paid for by... Can't say I was too surprised. Your situation with Richmond. Guy's an amateur, not ready for the big leagues. How do you figure? Carpetbagging rich kid who saved some souls a few years. He doesn't know how to win 'cause he never had to. I believed in that guy. I guess it was a one-way street. Maybe you're right. I know I'm right. That's why I asked you here. So, how about it? How about what? Come over and be part of a winning team for once. Mrs. Danzinger, you've been a generous donor, and I really hope I can rely on your support again. I'm sorry, councilman. We're not going to be able to help. No, I... Not at this time. I understand. I'm sorry. Of course. Thank you for your time. Senator Eaton's office. Hi. It's Gwen. Hi, Gwen. I need to see the senator. Does he have an opening? Let me check. You and Rosie were best friends. Yeah. I guess. You guess? I mean...We are. Were. Rosie's dead. I know. So, why'd you go down to the cage with her boyfriend? Did they force you? No! There was a lot of blood down there. I get really bad nosebleeds. I've gone to the hospital for them. But they didn't make me. I mean, I was drunk, and Jasper thought it'd be funny if I put on her witch costume. So what? Rosie was okay with that? She'd already left, didn't tell me where she was going. She never even said goodbye. Mm. You were mad at Rosie. She changed so much, you know? After she broke up with Jasper. She'd never hang out, disappear during fourth period, tell her mom she was spending the night, and she wasn't. Where was she going? I don't know. I saw her get on the bus a bunch of times. Which bus? Outside of school... the 108. What do you think she was doing? I think she met someone... Someone she couldn't tell anyone about. Not even her bff? We wasted a lot time 'cause of you, Sterling. Why'd you lie? I-I don't know. Why'd you go down there with him? 'Cause he was nice to me, okay? No one is nice to me. I mean, not like they are to Rosie. I'm like... Not even there when she's around. I didn't mean to hurt her. I didn't, but... Don't you ever just want to feel like... You're here? If Rosie was having an affair, it might explain the shoes. That key didn't fit her school locker, right? No. M-maybe she had some secret lockbox or something where she stashed the guy's love letters and stuff. Where? We already checked her bedroom. I'll talk to the Larsens... I'll do it. I'm meeting them at the station. 'Course you are. I-I love this partnership. Y-you do whatever you want, and I spend my time chasing you down. Is there a problem? Rosie was sneaking out during school, taking the bus, maybe meeting someone. Yeah? So? The 108 doesn't hit her neighborhood from here, from fort Washington. Find out where she went. Sorry to hear about the dead girl. We have it under control. I've been at this a lot longer than you have, Gwyneth. Maybe it's time to admit you bet on the wrong horse. I appreciate the concern, but I know what I'm doing. Tom Drexler. Can you get me a meeting? Well, it depends. Is this you asking...Or Darren? He doesn't know I'm here. Interesting. Going behind his back. Maybe you have a bit more initiative than I thought. I told you, dad. I'm doing this my way. Your way? Is that what you call sleeping with your candidate? Yeah? The coroner can facilitate the transfer to the funeral home. You'll just need to tell them where to send her. There's something that I need you to look at before you go. Um...Do you recognize these items? Are they Rosie's? We think so, yes. Did Rosie have a lockbox at home? I don't think so. We think she may have been seeing someone. I told you, she broke up with Jasper. Not Jasper. Possibly an adult. No, my daughter's not like that. Y-you don't know her. Y-you don't... you don't know anything about her. 
 
 Excuse me. Hi, Regi. Sure, I can pick up Jack. He's at the boat? Sorry about that. I'm so sorry, Mrs. Larsen, Mr. Larsen. Are we done here? I'm sorry. This is my one-on-one? Well, let's make the best of the opportunity we have. That means smile, Darren. I'm not sure that'll happen. At least you both like basketball. About 3:00 in the morning, we come back, and we find him in the hallway completely naked... Welcome to the snake pit. I didn't think this was your kind of scene, Darren. I could say the same about you, mayor. Oh, I just dropped by to toast the king of Seattle... And stick my waterfront project up his a... while I was at it. Well, you do know how to come bearing gifts. It's nice you two are a pair. In this racket, it's a miracle to find someone you can really trust, hmm? Ladies and gentlemen! Look who we have here. It's our very own mayoral candidates. In this corner, mayor Adams. Don't let that baboon smile fool you. No doubt, he will steal your money and then stab you in the balls. And here we have our challenger, Darren Richmond... bright-eyed, bushy-tailed, "yes, we can!" I got an idea. Screw the election. How about the two of you finish it right here, mano a mano? What say you? Winner take all? Much as I'm sure the mayor would love to show off his full-court game... I think I'll take my chances with the voters. Darren Richmond. No, I'm telling you, linden, this is stupid. Did you ask if he had seen her? No, the driver couldn't I.D. Her. I need you to check again. Yeah, whatever. Yo, chief, take one last look? You seen this girl? No. Jack? I'm here. Let's go. Aah! Gotcha, Lucy. Just a matter of time. Rick! You scared the crap out of me. Look, you couldn't make the tasting... I brought the tasting to you. Regi was in on this? Yes. Was Jack, too? Yes, everybody lied to you. Uh, it's called a surprise. The normal human response is shock, laughter, jumping up and down, or you could launch an investigation... Okay, I get it. ... Or establish a timeline. Shut up. I was a jerk last night. Sorry. No, I was... am. I brought you and Jack some clothes. Oh, you rock. What's this? Nothing. It's just a scratch. It's not happening again. Is it? What? Chasing after a dead girl. No, it's not. New partner complaining again. He can wait. New partner. I mean, the new guy. Rick, come on. I can't compete with a ghost. I mean, I can, right? But I won't. You don't have to. What time are Jack and regi coming back? I sent them to a French gangster film. It's like five hours long. Jack should be falling asleep... Right about now. You really thought this through. Are you gonna put that gun away? Maybe. The service will be about your daughter... The way she was meant to be remembered. We appreciate that, father. Have you thought about hymns? There are some very nice selections in here. Maybe you could pick out a few you'd like to consider. Yeah, yeah, I'll take a look. Mitch. You got any hymns you want to hear? We'll go with the usual, then. I think I have everything I need. Your daughter is with God now, Mrs. Larsen. He's watching over her... over all of you. He always is. What good is that to me? She's not supposed to be with God. She's supposed to be with me. Mitch, come on. My daughter... she was out there alone. And she was scared and she was hurt and she was alone. Tell me. Tell me, where was God then? Look at this sh1t hole of a waterfront. You know, there should be a stadium there. My stadium. Could you imagine hearing the roar of the crowd from up here? Gives me a hard-on just thinking about it. Another vanity project like the mayor's. Afraid I can't help you. Why are you here? 'Cause Adams has been robbing this city blind for almost a decade. It is time for a change. Oh, man. How does a rich kid from Connecticut get right here, right now, talking mumbo jumbo about the underprivileged? 25 years ago, I took a ride on a bus. I just never got off. I get it. You got to stay in character. I can respect that. You know...Most politicians are so in love with the sound of their own garbage, they can't keep their mouth shut. I like you, Richmond. As I said, I'm not here to help you. Well, maybe one day you will. But for now, I want Adams to go to his grave pissing in his adult diaper, knowing he lost this thing because of me. That alone will be worth it. Stan! What are we doing here? Gonna have to sell it. You bought this? Serious? Does Mitch know? Supposed to be a surprise. Rosie never had a backyard. You want to do something about that guy, that Richmond? Just say the word. We'll take care of it. Like old times. I don't do that anymore. Hey, girl. How about you and I take a trip down to the cage... Have some fun... Maybe squeeze a nosebleed or two in? Screw you, dickhead! Remember, Sterling... 
"no" means "yes." Hi. Hi. I'm so sorry, Mrs. Larsen. You have nothing to be sorry about. When you saw her on Friday, how was she? She looked...Happy. Was she seeing anybody? Anybody that she didn't want us to know about? I... I don't know. I'm sorry. I have to go, Mrs. Larsen. Okay. Okay. I'll see you? Yeah. Bye. Janek. Witam mój stary znajomy. I heard about Rosie. My condolences. I bought a house before all this. I can't move my wife, my kids now. I'm paying rent. I got a mortgage. I got funeral expenses. For 17 years, you ignored me... Walked right past me on the street. You know why. Forget it. Wait. Family always comes first. We were never family. My best to Mitch. Hey, Al. It's all yours. Hey, humor me, man. Have you ever seen this girl on the bus? Yeah, I recognize her. Seen her a few times. You sure about that? Look around, son. Ain't a lot of white girls on the end of this journey. You remember where she went? End of the line. Mrs. Larsen? Sorry, I don't, uh... I don't mean to intrude. You mind? No. No. I'm Bennet. Rosie was a great kid. Kids like her are, uh... Why I got into teaching in the first place. She was so smart and, uh... and eager to learn. Rosie wanted, uh... She wanted the world, you know? Mr. Larsen? The front door was open. I hate to disturb you, but I need to check Rosie's room again to make sure we didn't miss anything. I'm sorry about what happened at the station. You said she didn't suffer. You should've told us. Rosie loved poetry, literature. Rosie wrote her semester paper on this author. This was her favorite book. Sarah? She's not here. Get used to it. So, you thought you'd help yourself to our wedding cake? Well, it was here. Think we can do it? Do what? Eat it all. That's right. Come on. I can't do this solo. Yeah. Chocolate raspberry filling. Mmm. How's the white ganache? It's okay. Yeah? Mmm. Feeling it? Feeling what? The sugar rush. Kind of. Whatever. I'm in. Adams admit to planting the leak yet? Not yet. Give me some time. You know where to find me. Hey. How'd you know it wasn't me? Because if you wanted to screw me, you'd have found a smarter way to do it. Excuse me, gentlemen, detective holden from Seattle PD I'm looking for this girl. Have you seen her around? Yeah, I've seen her. She come here with that guy over there... In the photo.
