 Previously on Berlin Station. 
 [Keyboard clacking] 
 I just sent you a photo. 
 Who is this? 
 Daniel :  You tell me. 
 Daniel : Your friend, Claudia... her death was no suicide. 
 Shaw killed her. 
 I said I'm sorry. 
 I thought she would ruin everything. 
 Why'd you follow me? 
 Why did you speak with Ingrid Hollander? 
 Daniel : A mutual friend died. 
 Tragic accident. 
 I don't believe in accidents. 
 Neither do I. 
 Lovely to meet you, Esther Krug. 
 Valerie : I've learned from a former asset that Iosava is soliciting funds for a new refugee foundation right here in Berlin. 
 We're working on a plan to get one of our agents to infiltrate that foundation. 
 Until we can prove Iosava is a threat, she won't authorize an audio op. 
 Then let me do it. 
 Let my people do what you've been unable to do. 
 We have a 24-hour audio/video on Iosava's apartment... 
 Robert : We need Faisal to nail Iosava and to tell us what his government is going to do about Syria and ISIL. 
 Hector : If we don't do something, his people are gonna nab him! 
 They'll send you home and kill you. 
 It's okay, Hector. 
 I'm not fighting this anymore. 
 Are you seriously suggesting that I chance the exfil of a Saudi out of Germany? 
 We owe him. 
 Meeting at a hotel was a bad idea. 
 But it was something I needed to do. 
 I need to be myself. 
 I just got word that Faisal's on a plane to Riyadh. 
 Get the f*ck out of my face. 
 Hector : Beneath one secret, there's another and another and another. 
 One big f*cking mess of our own creation. 
 You need to be careful, Daniel. 
 Of what? 
 Everything.

 Christ Almighty, relax? Look at you. 
 I said I took care of it. 
 But how? What does that even mean? 
 Where there's a paper trail, there's Thomas Shaw to light it on fire and burn us alive. 
 That's a little melodramatic, Robert. 
 Yeah? 
 Yeah. 
 You think? 'Cause I don't. 
 This isn't us going down like Gerald. 
 You know, this is us going to jail for running paper agents and bilking Uncle Sam, for f*ck sakes.

 Oh, I have no idea. 
 Said he's antsy, wants to take a walk. 
 Walk?

 What are you implying? 
 I'd hate to think you were unwilling to cooperate with your new American friend. 
 Oh. [Chuckles] 
 Let me be clear, Mr. Miller. 
 You and I, we're not friends. 
 Really? After the warm welcome you've given me, I was so convinced.

 Well, clearly we had more than enough reason to be concerned. 
 Houjin Lin, the Chinese most wanted defector, AKA one of the biggest liabilities we have out there, is e-mailing you f*cking photos? 
 Are you kidding me? 
 He has cabin fever. 
 No, he has an Internet account that has your personal address in his contacts. 
 Do you mind explaining to me how the hell that got there? 
 I was planning to ask him that question myself.

 Aleksandre Iosava invited me tomorrow for tea, and I declined. 
 I said I had a business trip. 
 You came to us after Mohammed Merah shot up a Jewish day school. 
 You wanted to help rid Islam of its bad name. 
 And yet, here you are standing in front of me lying about meeting with Iosava.

 [Door closes] 
 I noticed you served in the same capacity under Steven Frost in his last posting... 
 COS Vienna. 
 Yes, I did. 
 And was it a request on either or both of you parts that you follow him out here? 
 Or did it just kind of work out that way? 
 I didn't follow him. 
 I presumed that headquarters wanted the tight ship we ran there and set down anchor here in Berlin. 
 Mm-kay. 
 I just couldn't help but notice. 
 Mm-hmm. 
 Is there a clerical question I can help you out with? 
 Otherwise, I have work to do. 
 Ah. 
 Okay. 
 Well, indeed there is, Sandra.

 Easy, Bora. 
 You're getting ahead of yourself.

 Do not say yes. 
 Just tell them you will think about it, Bora. 
 Whoa. 
 Whoa, what is he doing?

 He... he said yes? 
 He's saying yes? 
 What is that? 
 I don't know. 
 Hopefully, he lied for us, like a good agent.

 Chief. 
 Can I have a word with you? 
 In your office, please. 
 Well? 
 [Sighs] 
 We're done. 
 What? 
 They found out? 
 Oh, holy f*ck. 
 It's over. 
 Wait, you... are you f*cking with me? 
 You're f*cking with me? 
 [Laughs] 
 You're f*cking with me? 
 Oh. 
 You're f*cking with me. 
 [Sighs] 
 f*ck you. 
 [Sighs] 
 [Telephone rings] 
 [Sighs] Thank you for lying. 
 For protecting me. 
 Fake agents, Steven? 
 You know? 
 The last five of whom were alive when I brought you the files, then deceased when you brought back the box? 
 The only problem being they never existed in the first place. 
 Gemstone, Woodlawn, Mariner, Sundial, Pitchfork. 
 Yeah, I know. The list goes on and on and on. 
 [Sighs] 
 Um... 
 In 2008, Kelly and I were hit hard by the subprime crisis just like every other fool for real estate in America. 
 And we had to cash in our 529 fund, which was Laura's college tuition. 
 And I had to borrow money from friends because no bank would take us. 
 [Sighs] And at the same time, Robert was squeezed out of every last penny by his ex-wife for alimony. 
 So, there we were, these two broke schmucks, who watched Langley's budget skyrocket after 9/11, but our sh1t salaries never moved. 
 So... 
 [Sighs] 
 ...we started running fake agents. 
 They existed only on paper. 
 And we took... 
 We took the payments for ourselves. 
 [Sighs] 
 And that was a... that was a world that I lived in... seemed like forever. 
 And then something extraordinary happened. 
 You. 
 You. 
 And you were real. 
 But no games. 
 First real thing in my life [sigh] long time.

 You were like a sunburst on a gray German day. 
 Boom! 
 Wow.

 How did it go? 
 [Exhales] Fine. 
 Uneventful. 
 Define "uneventful." 
 I arrived, we talked, we had tea, and talked some more. 
 I left. 
 Bora, this is a debriefing. 
 It's not a dental appointment. 
 What did you talk about? 
 Politics, faith. 
 His wife was there. 
 They didn't reveal anything? 
 There was no sense of hidden agendas on their part? 
 No. 
 There were no overtures to get you to help them? 
 Just a nice invitation to tea? 
 That's it. It's, um, tradition in Islam, you know? 
 Hm. 
 All right, Bora, thank you. 
 Have a good night.

 Good riddance to the suits, huh? 
 I'll drink to that. 
 So, come on, give me the highlights reel.

 Where did they post you after Chechnya? 
 Don't ask. 
 Come on, I'm asking. 
 Hell. 
 They sent me to hell. 
 [Cheers and applause] 
 It's your lucky night, brother. 
 No, no, no. 
 Go get him. 
 Ohh. 
 I got to take a leak. 
 Hi, how you doing? 
 Wow.

 Is the bear a Catholic? 
 You want another one? 
 Yeah, sure. 
 Hey. 
 Happy birthday. Happy birthday. 
 Steven? 
 Are we having a senior moment? 
 [Sighs] 
 I might have a shot at Deputy Director. 
 What? 
 Yeah, what if? 
 Means no Provence, not now anyway. 
 Do you want it?

 [Thunder rumbles] 
 Perhaps I should've called you to a safe house. 
 Seeing your cover's been blown. 
 Now, do you want me to explain how I figured out what you're doing here in Berlin? 
 Or you just believe me when I say that I know you came here on Jemma Moore's bidding? 
 Do you care to respond? 
 I'd rather not. 
 Because you can't trust me? 
 Is that what Jemma told you? 
 Well, she's gone, and you can't do this alone. 
 I'll be the judge of that. 
 And I decide who does what in my station. 
 Understood? 
 Besides, I want to help you find Thomas Shaw. 
 Why? 'Cause he'll take us down if we don't take him down first.
