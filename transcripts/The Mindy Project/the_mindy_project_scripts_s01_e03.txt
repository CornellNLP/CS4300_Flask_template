 What do you mean, you have a s*x tape of me? 
 So you found the tape of me? 
 Well, well, well. 
 Looks like you guys do check your emails. 
 You are busted! 
 I sent you an email late saturday night  with a subject heading, "answer A.S.A.P." 
 Didn't hear from either of you. 
 Guys, I need to book those rooms for our conference in Santa Fe. 
 Just upgrade to the mesa view rooms. 
 It's 49 bucks, just do it. 
 I'm sorry I'm not a mind reader. 
 Mindy, it was saturday night. 
 I was otherwise occupied. Yeah, we get it. 
 You were hooking up with a supermodel. 
 I would hardly call this girl a supermodel. 
 I think you need to be booking domestic covers before you call yourself a supermodel. 
 Okay, Danny, what was your excuse? 
 Sittin' on your stoop, playing a harmonica? 
 I like to schedule c-sections for saturday nights. 
 Hospital's quiet. 
 It's really great, desolate. 
 Your weekend sounded really depressing, and your weekend sounded disgusting. 
 Actually, I had a great weekend. She wasn't a supermodel. 
 I had a great time. But she was, you know, she was attractive. 
 No, you guys don't understand. 
 Both of those weekends sound better than mine. 
 I fell asleep watching the movie  amelie. 
 And when I woke up, I had spilled so much red wine on myself that I thought for a second I had been shot. 
 Ooh. Hey, at least you're having fun. 
 That's all that counts. 
 Hey, Dr. I, Mrs. Olsen is here for your 9:30. 
 And be forewarned, her voice is very loud. 
 Shauna, you look terrible and awesome. 
 Did you party this weekend? 
 Yeah, I got a hookup with this guy Carlo. 
 Drake showed up with a white tiger. 
 Are you kidding? 
 The tiger left with Derek Jeter. 
 [Mouths words] 
 Okay, docs, if you need anything, I'll be answering phones under a damp washcloth. 
 Okay, thank you. 
 So where were we? 
 Guys, I gotta go find out more about this club. 
 Okay, what about the conference? 
 Guys, I don't care. I need this, all right? 
 Just pick the mesa room. 
 You know, speaking of emails, thanks for responding to mine this weekend. 
 Hey, man, I don't wanna join your tanning place. 
 But I get a free session. But you look orange. 
 I don't wanna look like that. This is cream of oak. 
 Shauna. Hi. 
 Hey, tell me about this club. 
 Do a lot of guys go there? 
 Guys who seem like they might be employed and stuff? 
 [Scoffs] You better believe it. 
 Makes club Aria look like thunder bar. 
 Ugh, thunder bar? 
 Kill me. Am I right? 
 It's not that bad. 
 No. No, you're right. 
 Thunder bar can be fun. Yeah. 
 Shauna, you have to take me clubbing with you this weekend. 
 I don't know, Dr. I. 
 I mean, is nightclub stuff still interesting to you? 
 Yeah. 
 Look, I might be in my 30s in doctors' years, but I'm, like, 22 in club years. 
 I don't know, doc. All right, look. 
 Give this to me, and I will let you switch your desk away from the air vent. 
 Hey, Carlo, it's Shauna. 
 I need to add a plus one at the club on friday night. 
 It's my boss, sort of a make-a-wish thing. 
 Ciao. 
 Shauna, are you going to a club with Dr. I? 
 Oh, you can't come, Morgan. 
 Look, you need me to come. Mm-mm. 
 I have these amazing pills. Oh, God. 
 Hold on. 
 If you put one in your drink, it counteracts the effect of a roofie. 
 The only problem is, if you're not already roofied, the pills have very roofie-like side effects. 
 So basically, your pill's a roofie. No! 
 Why does everyone say that? 
 It roofies the roofie. 
 Okay, Curtis explains this much better than me. 
 Hey, good news. 
 I got invited to this super hot nightclub friday night. 
 Ooh, I'm so jealous. 
 Why? Come with me. 
 I'd rather die. What? 
 Gwen : I can't do clubs anymore. 
 They make me feel judged and rejected by people that I would normally judge and reject. 
 Plus, they're so crowded and loud. 
 I haven't been to a nightclub in over a decade, and I've never gone without you. 
 Well, I can't go anyway because Carl is telling stories and folktales at the library about our town's history. 
 [Whispering] And I personally hate it. 
 But it's a really big deal, so I'm very proud of him. 
 All right, I'm a little disappointed in this conversation. Love you, bye. 
 Have fun.  You too. 
 Mindy, are you coming to office club night? 
 Could I give you a few things to keep in your purse? 
 I like to keep a trim profile. 
 How do you know about our club night? 
 Shauna? Sorry, doc. 
 Word kinda got out. I am so excited. 
 I ordered a new dress. 
 Mom says she's almost done sewing the sleeves. 
 Betsy's coming too?  Yeah. 
 Dr. C, you in for work night out? 
 Not this time. You guys have fun. 
 [Chuckles] 
 Okay, what's that? 
 What's that noise? 
 No, it... It's just funny to me. 
 What is? Picturing you at a nightclub. 
 You know? It's weird. 
 It's like Dracula on a beach. 
 What? I go out. Okay. 
 I do. 
 You know what? I'm in. 
 My grandma had this saying,  "you work hard, you play hard." Yep. 
 Your grandmother coined the phrase, "work hard, play hard"?  I know, right? 
 Never finished the third grade. 
 Club night. Yes! 
 Come on, right there. Whoo! 
 [Upbeat dance music] 
 [Vocalizing] 
 ♪ 
 [techno music] 
 "Tan-tru." 
 Shauna, is that Tibetan? 
 No, this used to be a Manhattan trust bank. 
 A couple of the sign letters fell off. 
 It's great though. 
 Nba players hang out here all the time. 
 Are you serious? Yeah. 
 Oh, my God. I'm gonna be at a club where nba guys are? Yeah. [Laughs] 
 This is amazing 'cause black guys love me. 
 All : Whoa. 
 Keep your racism voice down. Sorry. 
 That's not racist. 
 It's a scientific fact that black guys love lndian girls. 
 Don't... ah. And, black guys also love ass, which I happen to have a lot of. 
 Thank you very much. 
 So I'm gonna work my ass all the way to the V.I.P., if you know what I mean. The V.I.P.? 
 Yeah, good luck with that. 
 Morgan, you are jostling me with your duffle. 
 Oh, I'm sorry, doc. I'm sorry. 
 I got all my club supplies in here. 
 Just wanna make sure everything's organized. 
 I got three different kinds of prestige fragrances. 
 Got my sudokus to do during boring songs. 
 And then check this out Mindy, Mindy. 
 Most importantly, an eggbeater, so in the morning, I can make her an omelet. 
 Okay, guys, just listen up, so there's no misunderstanding. 
 When know what the score is, right, when we go into the club? 
 That we all hang out as friends from work. 
 This is incorrect. 
 She's saying that she'll bail on all of you if she meets a guy, right?  That's right. That's right, Shauna. 
 If I disappear, do not find me. 
 It mean that I am either falling in love, or I'm grinding up on some guy, or probably both. 
 Whoa, Dr. Castellano. 
 You look handsome like a youth minister. 
 Oh, thanks, bets. 
 Hey, someone's dad is here to pick them up. 
 Hey, what's up? How it's going? Hi. 
 Hey, doc, you look nice. Thanks, sweetheart. 
 Think this used to be my bank. Oh, yeah? 
 Yeah. Han solo. 
 Thanks, man. 'Sup, Carlo? 
 Me plus five.

 Ma'am, if everyone took a big dramatic moment in the doorway, the club would never fill up. 
 Oh, right, sorry, sorry. Let's go. 
 Oh, man, there is some talent here tonight. 
 Vodka tonic, bourbon rocks, and red wine with ice. Thank you. 
 What? 
 They didn't have sangria. 
 Hey, you guys, can't hang out with you tonight. 
 I'll talk you later... Maybe, okay? 
 Mm. 
 No wonder they call it the meatpacking district. 
 'Cause it's so packed, am I right? 
 [Laughs] 
 No, I'm just playin'. 
 It's not that packed. I can handle it. 
 Let me grab this bad boy. Okay. 
 Can I offer anyone a squirt of pink soap from the men's room? 
 No. I'm okay.

I didn't know you had that side to you. Baron : It's really Josh. He gave me some books when I was a rookie, and that really got my romance game going. You know what, as a matter of fact, Josh actually got me off coffee. I'm all about the green tea. Took my game to another level. He was jittery. He was getting so jittery. Right. Digestion's been better, hasn't it?  Slowed down a little bit. Digestion's been... Yeah. Baron : Hey, you know what I love about Josh? Your workout mixes, sick. Oh, God.
