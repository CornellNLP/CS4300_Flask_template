 Mindy : Some people might say that it's cliche to take a horse-drawn carriage ride through Central Park, but I say it's like living in an Edith Wharton novel. 
 Or actually like living in a HBO adaptation of an Edith Wharton novel, and, like, Kate Winslet's in it, and there's, like, boobs and stuff. 
 Sorry, wait, what was your question? 
 Where's your favorite pizza place? 
 And that was, like, 20 minutes ago. 
 Tonight's been really fun, Mindy. 
 I almost don't want it to end. 
 Doesn't have to. 
 [Horse whinnies] 
 [Chuckles] What was that? 
 Oh, Peanut Butter's getting up in years. 
 She's a good old girl. 
 Ain't that right, Peanut Butter? [Horse whinnies] Peanut Butter, no! I-I-I can't lose you, girl. Oh, my God, that horse just had a heart attack. Mindy, you're a doctor. Do something. I'm a gynecologist, Evan! Why don't you web design him back to life? [Siren whoops] Okay. Okay, okay. The police are here. We don't have to worry about this anymore. Just sit down. Driver : Peanut Butter is failing, officer. Don't worry, we're having a great time. Policeman : Sir, I think you need to make the humane decision. Driver : No! You put that gun away. Okay, we should go to a bar. [Gunshot] Ah! I'm feeling a little-- Yeah, yeah, uh, rain check. [Gunshots] [Gasps] Maybe you can, um... call me in a few months. Yeah, we'll see. [Hip-hop music] Betsy : I told him that I think I have enough refrigerator magnets. Good morning, team. You're all three minutes late, but hey, I'm more laid-back on Saturdays. What's with work Saturday, Dr. C, anyway? Yeah, last time I'm gonna say it. Saturdays are for one thing: Cartoons. Yeah, Saturday's when I run errands. Look, I want this practice to have a competitive edge, so I'm taking on a few more patients on the weekends. But to sweeten the deal, I brought you breakfast. Ooh, egg sandwiches and hash browns? Uh, cheeseburger omelets. No. No, you eat garbage, you do garbage work. Shredded wheats. It's healthy work fuel, and it tastes... Enough. Enjoy. Hey, why aren't Dr. Lahiri and Dr. Reed coming in? Yeah. Maybe they don't have the Castellano work ethic. [Laughs] What's so funny? [Muffled, goofy voices] This chart. Okay. Danny : Let's get to work, guys. Morgan : [Chuckles] Nope, it's-- it's a-- I'm gonna put this in my drawer. Okay, everybody to work. Ugh, what is his deal? Shauna : All right, come on, guys. There's only one thing the lowly worker can count on to fight back against the workplace tyrant. Both : Facebook. Nope. Booby traps. What? No. Check this out. Oh, yeah. Oh, yes, Morgan. This is a classic. What are you doing, Morgan? Oh, my God. Just watch. Dr. C is gonna come out of his office, and when he does-- What are you doing? Nothin', nothin'. You're gonna dump that water on my head? [Laughs] No. I was gonna... Dump it on my head. Saturday. Mindy : Man, Saturdays in Greenwich are the best. I love Carl, but I gotta say I really like this lineup. You, me, the kid, waffles. Carl is actually going out of town for a week, and I don't want to stay here. It's creepy. I think the house is haunted. Gwen, this house was built in 2007. Well...  Oh, you know what? You should come stay with me in the city. There's nothing scary about my apartment. I mean, it was the site of a horrible garment fire, but that was, like, in 1912. Do you want to have a sleepover at Mindy's? Does that sound fun, Riley? Oh, yeah. Okay, yeah, Riley would come. Okay. That is cool. Cool beans. No, no, no. Not "cool beans." You forgot about my daughter. Can you please... Riley, listen. Obviously, I want you to come to the city with your mother and stay with me. All right? We will have so much fun. Oh, there's that new play at NYU where the actors start in the audience, and then they kinda, like, creep out and scare-- I want a bunk bed. Yes, okay, all right. I'll get you--I'll get you a bunk bed. Are you sure about this? Of course. I can do anything as long as it's just paying for something. I posted a video to your wall. Do you like fat cats that squeeze into small boxes? Betsy, don't make me unfriend you again. [Phone rings] Oh, my ex Dominic just added four photos to the album "brunch." Did you guys not hear that phone ringing? [Phone ringing] Every time I walk by,  you guys are doing your Facebooks. It's called "Facebook," Dr. Castellano. Myface, tweetster, hash bags, I don't care. Are you trying to get it wrong? No. URL, webmaster, blogs. Now you're just saying random words. Okay, look, the point is I don't want to see it anymore. Okay? No more facebooks. Betsy : Facebook. [Phone ringing] Good morning. Shulman and associates. Yes, it would bring me great pleasure to connect you. [Hangs up phone] Dr. Castellano's such a tyrant. I mean, this isn't the 1900s, where you can just oppress your workers until they get cholera to death. I guess we'll just have to go back to using the original lnternet. Magazines. Time, Newsweek, The Economist. It's all frikkin' CNN stuff. Where's  People  magazine? I want photos of celebrities buying groceries in sweat pants. I haven't seen it, actually. Derek, have you seen  People? Yeah. People. No,  People  magazine. Oh, that? Usually one of the doctors steal it. And the rich get richer. If you don't quit talking, I'm sliding my glass. We're gonna find that magazine. [Phone line ringing] [Phone beeps] Go. Hey, Morgan. It's Mindy. From work?  Yeah, Morgan. From work. Mindy from work. I'm sorry, I just-- My neighbor has a cat whose name is also Mindy. I--what's going on? Look, I need you to come here and help me build a bunk bed. Okay, I-I'm in. But it's gonna cost you. 20 bucks and a slice of pizza. Yeah, sure, that sounds great. Wait. 10 bucks and two slices of pizza. Yeah, fine, fine. Wait-- Morgan! No! I can't-- No, just come over. I'm coming. I'm coming right now. I'm coming right now. Morgan, here's the bunk bed. All right. Yup. Let me just check. Sometimes they don't-- Oh, yeah. You know what? I do think we're jumping into this too quickly. Okay, yeah. So let's take a step back. What...is...a... bunk bed? Morgan. Hey, Morgan. Where's Morgan? Okay. Hey, Morgan. Hey. I got your cran-raspberry juice. I'm not really sure why the cran-apple I got you was "absurd." Whoa, Morgan, this looks pretty good. What about the guy building it? Hey, you know what? You look pretty good too. Mm, suck it, bunk bed. Nah, that's-- [Doorbell buzzes] Ah, I'm so psyched. Thank you! Hey, Danny. What are you doing here? I'm here to take my worker back to work at the place where he works. No, Danny-- Morgan, out. Yeah, sorry, doc. I, uh, kinda promised Dr. L I'd help her build this thing. Okay, let me ask you something. Doesn't the practice also pay for your health care? Dr. Lahiri, best of luck with the bunk bed. Morgan, Morgan, we're almost do--Morgan! I'm sorry. I cannot go back to Canada to get my drops. If I don't have my drops, I don't even want to say what will happen. Ugh, okay, fine, just go. My urethra will close up. Morgan-- Gross! Get out of here! Morgan, come on. I think we're on the same page. Okay. Get out, get out. God! I don't know-- I don't know what I'm gonna do. Why do you need a bunk bed? Are you trying to lure marines in here, so you could hook up with them? Okay, that's gross. No, I'm not. Okay, good. The only way to get my best friend to come into the city was to make a bunk bed for her daughter. I have a couple hours before my next patient. I mean, I could--I could finish this in a half an hour. Wait, are you serious? Sure, there's a certain pride you get in building something with your own two hands. We lost that as a country. Okay, I don't know about that, but, Danny, thank you so much. Where are the directions? Here you go. I don't do directions. Okay, that was a bit much. Put on some music. And none of your girly stuff. This might be challenging, but I think I know what to do... [Light My Candle  from  Rent  plays] Hey, what did I say about the girly music? This is the most masculine Broadway song that I have. Turn it off. I ca-- I can't work like this. Okay, I also have Alan Cumming reading the audiobook of  Lovely Bones. No. You got any Zeppelin? Who? Danny : Do me a favor. Hold this-- Hold this steady down there. Yup. Got it? Mm-hmm. Thank you. So what's on tap for your big weekend with, uh, your friend and the kid? As a matter of fact, I made up an itinerary. An itinerary? You have to have an itinerary. That's how you maximize fun time per hour. Okay, first, we're getting dim sum at the golden unicorn. Obviously. Okay. Then we're going to an underground sample sale on prince street. Wait, don't tell anyone. I'll do my best not to. Then we're getting microderm facials, because after a morning like that, our pores are gonna be a mess. It's gonna be the best. And you're bringing a seven-year-old kid to all that? No, she will stay here and have fun with the bunk bed. I'm guessing that your friend might actually want to spend time with her daughter. With all due respect, Danny, you don't know anything about children. I don't? No, I mean, you come from the generation where the adults just, like, let the kids do whatever they want, so they could smoke pot and go to key parties. Okay, first of all, we're from the same generation. No, we are not, for the last ti-- Second of all, I know a lot about kids-- a lot about kids, 'cause I basically raised my little brother Richie. You did? Yeah. Brothers raising brothers? That is so catholic, Danny. I'm sorry, is that offensive to say? Just get me the Phillips head. Um... The crisscrossy one. Why didn't you say that in the first place? Dr. Castellano is out of the office. Come on. [Gasps] Jackpot. How ironic. The guy who hates people reads  People. It's like if I read a magazine called  Mustard On Hot Dogs. There's something else in the drawer. It's addressed to "Christina." Oh, my God, that's his ex-wife. Let's read it. Eh... Danny : Dear Christina, when I left for the airport today, I could only picture two things: Your gorgeous, naked body, and-- Both : [Gasp] Should we keep reading? Yes. In all seriousness, if I was a little girl, this thing would bring me a lot of joy. Yeah, man. This bunk bed, it is bangin'. So you got any food in there? Can you make me a sandwich or something? Okay, I do not think that I have the components for that. Okay. But I do have some tequila. And get this: The bottle-- it is in the shape of a shotgun. Yeah, let's do that, yeah. Yeah? Okay. 
 
 Hello! Riley : The bunk bed! The bunk bed! Gwen : Hey, Mindy. Oh, wow, you did it. Oh, hey. What's up? I'm Danny. Hi. I'm Gwen. This is Riley. Hey. What's up, Riley? Are you her boyfriend? No. Why? You looking for one? You interested? No. Oh, be sweet, honey. Okay? Sorry. Riley, I just wanted to let you know that I am the best godmother that you have ever had; Look at this. Did you know that, Danny? I'm her, uh, [imitates Godfather] Godmother. What's that? Charles Brando. Charles Brando? No, no, no, it's Marlon Brando, okay? Marlon Brando doesn't sound like that, he sounds like this: [Imitates Godfather] I'm your godmother. I'm her godmother. Chin out with it. Don't--it's not about the chin, it's-- it's the whole attitude of it. I'm her godmother. I'm her godmother. I'm her godmother. I'm her god-- Aah! Oh, my God, oh, my God! Danny : No matter how hard I try, I'll never forget the shame I felt when I found you in bed with another man. Morgan : Can't take it. It's too sad. Too sad. Do you want us to stop? We ain't stoppin'. Morgan, if you can't handle it, get out. I can handle it. Danny : No matter how hard I try... Oh, God. Danny : I'll never forget the shame I felt when I found you in bed with another man. I can't--I can't-- Danny : And I know now that I'll never be able to fall in love again. Look, he even included a drawing of the child they never had together. No wonder Dr. Castellano can be such a jerk. He got his heart broken. You guys, they were meant for each other. Dr. Castellano will be alone forever. Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow. Oh, God. Try to keep it still, okay? Danny, we are just a few broken planks away from me being this kid's mom. I'm gonna check it out, okay? Hey, hey. This house--not equipped for kids, all right? I eat cereal out of wine glasses. Wow! It's all about you. It's always about you. I'm just saying. Danny : Okay, how's that feel? [Winces] Ow, ow, ow. Okay, it's definitely a fracture. Yeah, that thing is broke as hell. Mommy, are they gonna cut your arm off? Stop freaking them out, okay? No, no, no, sweetie. Everything's okay. They're not gonna cut her arm off. But it is serious. She needs her bone set. I'm gonna take her to the hospital. Mindy, you take care of the kid. Wait, no, Danny. Hey, Danny, Danny. Why don't I go to the hospital with Gwen? You could stay here with Riley-- I got Gwen, and we'll give you a call when we're done. Okay.  Ready? I don't--okay. Gotta keep it still. Okay, just take a Vicodin from the bathroom, okay? The medicine cabinet. You know where it is. Sweetie, you stay with auntie Mindy, okay? I love you so, so much. I miss my mommy. Uh, what are you talking about? She's, like, basically still here. But I miss her! Well, that's irrational 'cause she's... Barely been gone-- There, there. There, there. It'll be okay. [Horn honks] 'Scuse me, can I have some more Vicodin, please? No, no more Vicodin. You can't-- That's the money slot. You can't crawl through that, okay? Oh, God. Just sit still. Keep driving, sir, thanks. Which one are you? Which one what? Are you the British guy, the old guy, or the handsome jerk? [Groans] Please, just a little more. No, no. A little, baby Vicodin... No, there's no Vicodin in there. You just gotta keep your arm still, okay? Okay. Handsome jerk's got you. You didn't want to do any of my dares,  and you said that my truths were boring. What else can we do? Tell me a story. Oh, man, can the TV tell you a story? Okay. Thank you. All right, this is gonna be good. This is gonna be really, really good. [TV chimes] Oh, great. The Dust Bowl,  a film by Ken Burns. You're going to love this. I hate it here! I'm going to my room. Mindy : Wait, that's my room. Hey, do not go through my drawers. Especially the top one. Okay, Gwen, my friend Jordan's on call. He's a great doctor. He's gonna take care of you, okay? Okay, okay. She's with me, okay? Just bring her in. Hi. Thanks. I'll be out here waiting for you, okay? Did anybody just see that? I know a guy named Jordan too. Can I just skip the line? Unbelievable. Excuse me? Well, first, you cut everybody, and now you're using a cell phone. What are you gonna do next-- push wheelchair guy down the stairs? I'm a doctor, so don't worry about it. Really? Well, then you of all people should know that those cell phones can make all the machines in here explode. What's your problem? Your peg leg itching you? You lose your treasure map? Your parrot fly away? Is that what I have to look forward to? Morons making pirate jokes? Mindy : Hey, Riley,  do you still want to hear a story? Okay. It is about the first time I met your mom. We actually liked the same guy on our floor freshman year. This, um, white guy with dreadlocks from long island. He was super, super hot. Very hard look to pull off. But the point is that your mom and I actually weren't very good friends when we first met either. But it all worked out, because over winter break, he broke his leg in a skiing accident. Your mom and I had some time to get to know each other, and we have been best friends ever since. And I'm not promising anything, but I have a pretty good feeling that, uh, you and I could be pretty good friends too. Really? Yeah. Oh, hell, yeah. And you know what, it's actually even easier because you and I are not even gonna be competing for the same guys. For, like, at least ten years. Danny : So what happened? I was jogging in Central Park, and a pigeon flew into my eye. I like pigeons. They're free to leave, but they choose to stay here in New York all winter long. Unlike those other coward birds. I don't like the one that did this to my eye. Yeah, that one sounds like a bad one. Want me to take a look?  Okay. Let's see what we got. Okay. Is it bad? No, no, I'm gonna prescribe you some steroid drops, and then you'll-- you're gonna be okay. [Cell phone chimes] Okay. Sorry. Oh, my-- [Phone chiming] Really? Are you kidding me? [Phone chiming] Your, uh, wife texts you a lot. Oh, I'm not married. I, um-- I used to be, but ancient history. This--this is just my employees. They're bugging me because I banned some Facebook thing. I just hate that site. That's too bad. Why's that? I would've friended you. Morgan, what is the matter with you? You're drivin' us crazy. I did it. I mailed the letter. [Gasps] Oh, my gosh. Dr. C’s gonna kill you! Well, kiddo, I guess no bunk bed this time around. It's okay. Mindy's bed is big enough for all of us. It is, and now, we should go to sleep because we have a big day ahead of us tomorrow. We do? Yeah, Riley and I made up a whole itinerary. See? First, we are going to Central Park Zoo to look at some koalas. Then we're gonna ride our bikes to the Bronx zoo to look at more koalas. She's really into koalas. She's crazy about koalas. And then Riley would like to try on some of my bras. Which I, of course, wanted to run by you first. That's a lot of stuff to do in one day. Mm-hmm. But, uh, are you sure you're up for it, Riley? Riley? [Whispering] Do you want to go grab a drink in the living room? Really? Yes. Yes, I would love that. I'm dying. Yeah. Okay. Okay, let's go. Um... Get the kid off me. I--just-- Oh, sorry. Okay, thank you. Come on, come on. Coming. [LCD Soundsystem's  Watch The Tapes] ♪ ♪
