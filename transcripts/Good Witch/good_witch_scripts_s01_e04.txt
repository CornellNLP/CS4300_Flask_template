 narrator :  Previously on Good Witch... 
 Why won't you tell me what's really going on? 
 I can't. 
 You told him, didn't you? 
 No. Nick! 
 Ryan's fiancée took off with his best friend. 
 You're together? 
 Together. 
 They make a nice couple, don't they? 
 ♪♪♪ 
 I saw the light. Thought you might need this. 
 Aah! 
 I take it business is good? 
 This is my first break today. 
 OK, you need to hire a receptionist or a nurse... or a barista. 
 (chuckling) 
 Thank you for the coffee. 
 It's very thoughtful. 
 I had a really good time at the dance the other night thanks to you. 
 It was not a dull evening, that's for sure. 
 Would you like to have another not-so-dull evening? 
 This is where you'd say something. 
 Dinner. 
 OK? Friday night? 
 I'd love to.

 Oh, great. Amber begs me to be partners with her on our history project. We're supposed to work on it tonight and she just bailed on me. 
 Bribe her with some dessert. 
 Mom, girls like Amber don't eat. 
 That's one of the reasons they're so mean: they're really hungry. 
 (chuckling) 
 Being mean is just a defense mechanism: pushing someone away before they have a chance to push you away, when what she really wants to do is be your friend Mom, you just don't get it. 
 It's been a long time since you were in high school. 
 True, true. But with age comes wisdom. 
 For you. 
 A compass? 
 That was Dad's. 
 From when he was a Scout. 
 I just happened to find it in some boxes at the store today. 
 Or maybe it found me. 
 I have a feeling it's for you. 
 Daddy was, like, eight when he had this, and I'm practically 16. 
 And I'm a girl. 
 You know, your father always said he never felt lost when he had this compass. 
 But I'm not lost. 
 North Middleton. 
 Have a good evening, Ma'am. 
 (footsteps) 
 Cassie. 
 What's with the suitcase? 
 Oh, I'm sorry. I thought you were somebody else for a minute. 
 No, I'm just me. 
 Abigail. 
 Abigail? 
 Were you expecting her? 
 Because she didn't say... 
 She's not a guest, Sam. 
 I'm family. 
 Hi, cousin. 
 (theme music playing) 
 ♪♪♪ 
 I can certainly see the family resemblance. 
 We have a lot in common. 
 Most of the time. 
 Lori! 
 Abigail! Hi. 
 Wow, you've grown! 
 Yeah. That happens. 
 And Grace! 
 Oh! 
 Hi. Abigail, I've heard so much about you. 
 I'm glad to finally meet you, I don't really remember you from before. 
 Well, you were very young last time that I visited. 
 Dad, are you here? 
 Some Paul guy keeps calling, something about his sick kid. 
 He tried your cell, but... 
 ...it goes straight to voice-mail. 
 PS: I'm not your receptionist. 
 Well, I should go give Paul a call. 
 Nice to meet you. 
 I'll see you around, Sam. 
 I haven't heard from you in a while. I was getting worried. 
 I tried to call last month. 
 My cell was stolen. 
 I have a new number. I'll give it to you. 
 I've just been so busy with work. 
 The ad agency in New York? 
 Yeah. 
 Did I tell you that? 
 You didn't need to. 
 Right. You had a feeling. 
 I did and I do, all the time. 
 Well, I had so much vacation time they insisted I use some. 
 Did they? 
 They did. 
 I thought it would be a great excuse to come see you. 
 All of you. 
 I really miss having my family around. 
 Family is always there for you. 
 Unconditionally. 
 Grey House is happy you're back. So am I. 
 Do you wanna talk about it? 
 I saw the way you looked at Abigail. 
 We have a history. 
 I can tell. 
 Sister to sister, it's really easy to get sucked in by all her Abigail-ness. 
 And then it's easy to get hurt, so proceed with caution. 
 Yeah. (birds chirping) 
 Mom, everybody is going. 
 How is everyone in your class going to see an R-rated movie? 
 Lauren's older sister is going to take a bunch of us. 
 Who's Lauren? 
 We have biology together. 
 AP. She's a junior and she's really cool. And she invited me. 
 I mean,  me.  That is a big deal. And all the older kids are going. 
 But you're not an older kid. 
 (sigh) 
 OK, what is going on? 
 I need caffeine for all this drama. 
 I want to see the new Chris Hemsworth movie, but... 
 Come on, think of what you were doing when you were Grace's age. She's practically 18. 
 She's 15. 
 I'm sorry, but the answer is no. 
 Mom... 
 Don't be in such a hurry to grow up. 
 But I'm not. 
 And you need to realize that whether you like it or not, I am growing up, OK? And I may not be 18, but I'm not a baby. 
 I got this. 
 Oh, good. 
 I was worried for a minute, but Abigail's got this. 
 ♪♪♪ 
 (door chime dinging) 
 Hey. 
 Hey. Uh, you look upset. 
 No, I'm not upset. I'm confused and... 
 Well, yeah a little upset. For the record, you kissed me. 
 You know, one moment doesn't change everything. 
 One really great moment. 
 And change is part of the natural order of things. 
 And... Why am I telling you this? You know more about this stuff than I do. It's life. You don't change, you die. 
 OK, you're overreacting. 
 And you are underreacting. What? 
 It's not like I am asking you to marry me. 
 I'm just asking you to acknowledge the fact that there may be something really wonderful here if both of us are brave enough to admit it. 
 I just don't wanna lose the one thing that got me through the toughest time of my life. 
 You. 
 You are never gonna lose me. 
 You can't make a guarantee like that. 
 Sure I can. 
 It's a gamble. 
 OK, look... 
 Let's just go back to the way we were. 
 Forget about the kiss. 
 Let me take you out for a meal. Just a meal between friends. 
 Maybe we have to go back to go forward. 
 You think? 
 I'm willing to bet on it. 
 (door chime dinging) 
 Uh, yeah, fine. 
 Yeah, I'll see you then. 
 Hi. Remember me? 
 Yes, of course. 
 I wanted to come by and properly thank you for last night. 
 Oh, it's my pleasure. 
 Can I buy you a cup of coffee? 
 I'm sorry, but I've got a patient in the back and, um... 
 (phone ringing) 
 And I'll have to let that go to voice-mail. - May I? 
 Doctor's office. Yes, can you come in this afternoon? 
 Dr. Radford had a cancelation. How does 3:00 sound? 
 Great. 
 We'll see you then. 
 (phone beeping) 
 How did you know... 
 You really are like Cassie, aren't you? 
 In some ways. Why don't you let me help? 
 I'll answer the phone, you need a receptionist... 
 Don't you work in New York? 
 I'm sensing a change of occupations in my future. 
 (phone ringing) 
 Doctor's office. 
 Yes, what time would be convenient for you? 
 Perfect, we'll see you then. 
 ♪♪♪ 
 Looking for something? 
 Commitment. 
 Something that'll push Sam over that last hurdle. 
 He isn't quite over his divorce. There's still a lot of pain from his ex-wife he hasn't dealt with. 
 Well, I think he really wants to be with me. 
 He just... 
 He isn't quite there yet. So, help me to help him get there, OK? 
 Orange blossom, patchouli and honey. It was rumored to be the only scent that Cleopatra wore. 
 It's simple, classy... 
 Sexy. (both chuckling) 
 It's like me in a bottle. (chuckling) 
 Me and Cleo. 
 Now, it's pretty potent, so use with discretion. 
 Well, I can't make any promises. 
 ♪♪♪ 
 (Cassie sighing and rubbing her hands) 
 So... 
 So, it's cold. 
 Yeah. 
 You got the listing. 
 Yeah, yeah. Keating's grandson in Chicago was looking at three realtors, I got the listing. 
 Congratulations. 
 Thanks. It was important to me that you be here. 
 This won't be easy. 
 A house like this needs special care, but I know that you'll make sure it ends up in the right hands. 
 Keating's grandson just wants as much money as he can get. 
 But it's not just about money. 
 To him it is. 
 But not you. 
 You're freezing. 
 I forgot my gloves. 
 Here. 
 I'm kind of glad you did. 
 ♪♪♪ 
 (door opening) 
 Don't worry, he'll show. 
 You think? 
 Honey, look in the mirror. 
 (chuckling) Thank you. 
 What is that lovely fragrance you're wearing? 
 Oh, you like it? 
 I do. 
 (chuckling) 
 May I? 
 Sure. We girls have to stick together, right? 
 We do. 
 I love patchouli. 
 Excuse me. 
 Sam. 
 Hey! 
 Hi! 
 Sam! 
 Sam? 
 I thought you were going to stand me up. You were right. 
 Was I? 
 Stephanie, this is Cassie's cousin. 
 Abigail. 
 She's helping me out at the office. 
 I'll bet she is. 
 I'll give you a minute to decide. 
 ...Your order. 
 I got us a table. 
 Great. 
 (smelling) Wow. Is that you? 
 Yes. You like it? 
 Yeah, and normally I'm allergic to perfume. 
 Oh. 
 Sorry I'm late. House call. 
 Oh. So, there are still doctors that make house calls? 
 I never thought I'd be one of them, but yes. 
 It's very dedicated of you. 
 Well... 
 You seem dressed up. 
 You sound so surprised. 
 No, it's just that when you asked me to come out and talk, you seemed... 
 When I'm depressed, I like to dress up. 
 So you're depressed? 
 I'm all kinds of things at the moment. 
 That's why I needed to talk to someone. 
 What about Cassie? 
 We don't see eye to-eye on certain things, but Cassie is one of the best listeners I've ever met. 
 That's the problem. Cassie's kind of perfect at everything. 
 It can be intimidating sometimes. 
 I knew you'd understand. 
 This developer was looking at Blairsville. 
 The mayor was more than happy to share that news with me. 
 He wants to make an offer here. 
 The Keating House? 
 Yeah. 
 He wants to tear it down and he's gonna put up six very high-end townhouses. 
 Well, that means jobs. And a new tax base. 
 And development especially high-end development shows a town on the rise. 
 Plus, I get to stick it to Blairsville. 
 Looks like it's a win-win situation all around. 
 (inhaling) 
 But... 
 But... the buyer doesn't want any roadblocks. 
 And the land on the Keating House is currently zoned single-family residential. 
 But if it weren't? 
 I think we might have something to celebrate. 
 It's a very big deal, Martha. 
 I think, as mayor, it's time for me to reevaluate some of the zoning areas around town. 
 Not everyone in town might feel the way you feel. 
 Oh, pfft! I am leading Middleton to a new revenue source and a bigger, brighter future. 
 (chuckling) Who won't like that? 
 Hey, there. 
 Hey! 
 So I will admit to being completely in the dark, but is something wrong with our kids? 
 (sigh) 
 Seems to be more than the normal amount of animosity between them. I never know what's happening with Nick until the principal calls. 
 You OK? 
 Yeah. Growing pains. 
 Oh. Grace? 
 Yeah, for both of us, I think. 
 Well, if it's any consolation, I don't think Grace's growing pains mean that you'll be hearing from the principal any time soon. 
 Teenagers. 
 Yeah. I knew this day was coming, but now that it's here... 
 You know, when I got out of Med School, I had to take my boards, an eight-hour test with over 300 questions, and the score on this test determines which residency program you're matched with. 
 I never thought anything could be that difficult. 
 And then Nick turned 13. 
 (chuckling) 
 Grace is a good kid. 
 Yeah. So is Nick. 
 Well, he has his moments. 
 God willing, I can string enough of them together to get him out of high school and into a college. 
 Hey, thanks. 
 Anytime. 
 Hey, Abigail is great, by the way. 
 Yeah. She's working for you at your office. 
 She said it was your idea. 
 Abigail can be a handful. 
 I can handle her. 
 Just make sure she's not handling you. 
 Will that be all, sir? 
 "Sir"? Is this about last night? 
 You mean your date? 
 It wasn't a date. She needed somebody to talk to. 
 Oh, please. That is the oldest trick in the book. 
 ...So I've heard. 
 Are we still on for tonight? 
 Yeah. 
 That new French place? 
 Sure. I could pick you up? 
 I have to cover here until 7:00, so... 
 I'll meet you there. 
 (chuckling) 
 Grace! Are you in there? 
 Don't you like it? 
 Um... 
 Where did you get it? 
 Guilty. 
 (chuckling) 
 Um... Well, you can't wear it to school. 
 This is what the kids are wearing today. 
 Yeah, not my kid. Grace! 
 You're being totally unfair. 
 You can't keep me a little girl forever. 
 (sigh) 
 It's just an outfit. 
 Her job is to push the limits and my job is to enforce them. 
 But if you become just an enforcer, she's just gonna keep pulling away. My advice: loosen your grip a little bit. 
 I can't. 
 No, you just don't want to. 
 No, I can't. 
 Because I'm the only one left with a grip on her. 
 I'm sorry. 
 I just know how upset Grace has been since Jake died. 
 You do? 
 We all have our gifts. 
 We do. 
 I feel very connected to Grace in a way that maybe you... 
 Abigail, I know you mean well... 
 I do. 
 I'm so glad you can see I'm just trying to help. 
 You're the best.

 Hi, all. 
 Hey. 
 Hi! 
 I brought muffins. 
 Cranberry, my favourite! 
 I'm allergic to cranberries. 
 Uh, thanks. Excuse me. 
 I brought the muffins for Sam. 
 Oh, it's clear that you're here for Sam. 
 Aren't you the waitress? 
 And I see you're the new receptionist. 
 Office manager. 
 I own the Bistro. 
 Lucky you're single, then. 
 Running a small business by yourself must take up all your time. 
 Not all of it. 
 So, you'll be leaving soon, going back to New York? 
 My plans might change. 
 Well, what on earth could Middleton have to lure you away from the big city? 
 Family, of course. 
 Of course. 
 So, we still on for tonight? 
 We have a date. 
 Looking forward to it. 
 It was a pleasure talking to you. 
 Oh, you too. 
 So, I heard you're selling Keating house to a developer. 
 Martha. 
 In her defense, I think she just wanted to get me on board with the sale, since she knew it would be unpopular with the town council. 
 So, do you really think that tearing down Keating house is the best option for our town? 
 I don't have the choice. 
 Sure you do. 
 No, not when you're in sales. 
 That's not true. 
 You're in retail, I am in real estate. If you don't like something, you just don't carry it. I don't have that luxury. 
 But you still have a choice. 
 Look, this is pretty simple. 
 Someone makes an offer, I have to accept that offer for my client if that's what my client wants. 
 The choice is theirs, it's not mine. 
 This is not about what I want, Cassie. 
 This is not personal, Cassie. 
 This is business. 
 But in Middleton, all business is personal. 
 Anthony! 
 Hi. 
 Does this mean you're talking to me again? 
 Yeah. 
 (chuckling) 
 You know I'm sorry about the dance and Nick. 
 Why did you do that? 
 I don't know, I mean... 
 He's always bugging me, so I thought I'd bug him. 
 Basically, I was a jerk, and if there's anything I can do to make it up to you, name it. 
 Anything? 
 Well, I'm not prepared to commit murder, but other than that, name it. 
 Amber is no help. 
 You need help with your history project? 
 Please. 
 Done. 
 You're the best. 
 I'm glad you're back to thinking so. 
 Hi. 
 Hi. 
 Working? 
 Yeah. 
 Uh, on an article about a local dairy farmer who is converting part of his field into wind turbines. 
 You left a big-city newspaper to write articles about cows. 
 Well, my career is important, but so is family. I wanted more of a balance. 
 Interesting. 
 What about you? 
 Well, I was in advertising, but... 
 You  were  in advertising? 
 I thought you were just on a break from your job. 
 I am, but I'm thinking about making it more permanent, especially now that Sam needs me. 
 ...For work. 
 Why don't we hang out like we used to? 
 I don't think it's me you came to hang out with. 
 I'm too old to blindly follow you anymore. 
 Oh, I get it. 
 You're afraid I'm gonna take your place as big sister with Grace. I can't ask Grace not to like me. 
 What exactly did I do to you? 
 You have a long history of making promises and not delivering. 
 And the list is too long to go into, but I guess I don't want Grace to have a list like mine someday. 
 (sigh) 
 I miss you, Dad. 
 What's wrong? 
 (sigh) 
 I really wanted to go to the movie. 
 I'm kind of bummed. 
 (sigh) 
 We still can. 
 I'll take you. 
 Mom said no. 
 I can't. 
 What if we could do something even better than the movie? 
 Hey. 
 Hey, Sam. 
 I just wanted to ask you a question. 
 Sure. 
 Abigail. She's completely organized my office. 
 OK. 
 Maybe you could talk to her about letting me pay her. She doesn't seem to want anything from me, but I don't feel right about that. 
 You know, I think Abigail can take care of herself. 
 Well, she puts on this incredibly confident front, but underneath, I think she's a little insecure. 
 Abigail is brilliant at figuring out what people want, but not necessarily what they need. 
 She thinks you don't approve of her. 
 No, she wants you to think I don't approve of her two very different things. 
 Look, I know what it's like to feel you don't measure up to your family's expectations. 
 Really? 
 Well, my father was tough. 
 If I got an A, it was expected. It was not congratulated. 
 And if I got anything less than an A, well, he let me know it was unacceptable. 
 Well, if Abigail has a problem with me, she should come to me. 
 You have to know that you're a little intimidating. 
 (chuckling) 
 I think maybe she was just more comfortable talking to somebody... 
 ...not so perfect. 
 I'm not perfect. 
 To her you are. 
 She told you that? 
 She didn't mean anything by it. 
 Abigail always means something. 
 (both giggling) 
 Ah! OK. 
 I'll see you later. 
 OK. 
 Hi! 
 Hi. 
 Hi. 
 What's up? 
 Oh, just girl talk. 
 Yeah. 
 I should get back to Sam. I'll see you later. 
 Grace... 
 Don't worry, it's all good. 
 Where are you off to? 
 (chuckling) 
 Anthony's meeting me at the Bistro to help me work on that project that's due next week. 
 Amber's no help. 
 (sigh) I'm sorry about the movie. 
 Oh, I get it. 
 I don't like it, but I get it. 
 Aren't you going to dinner with Ryan? 
 Yeah... You know, maybe when I get back, we could stay up late and watch a movie. 
 It won't be the Hemsworth movie, but I'm sure we can find something good. 
 (chuckling) That's sweet. 
 But I'll probably just go straight to bed when I get home. I'm beat. 
 OK. 
 I could give you a ride. 
 I wouldn't want you to get lost. 
 (chuckling) To the Bistro? 
 I think I'll be OK. 
 Everything looks good so far, but I'll let you know when the tests are back. (crash) 
 Are you all right? 
 I don't know. 
 Here, let me take a look. 
 No, go. Please. I don't want to make you late for your date. 
 My X-ray is down, but to be safe I need to get a better look. You did say you fractured that ankle once before, so this joint is at least susceptible. 
 If you insist. 
 I do. 
 The closest X-ray is a town over. 
 Let me make a phone call and tell Stephanie I'll be a little late. 
 Oh no, I feel awful. Go to your date, I'll make my own way to the hospital. 
 Stephanie will understand. 
 She's so sweet. 
 Oh, here. 
 Here. 
 That better? 
 Much.

 What are you doing?

 Going out. 
 We're going out? 
 Well not "we". 
 I'm meeting someone. 
 OK.

 Another glass of wine, ma'am? 
 Why don't you bring the bottle? 
 OK. 
 Thanks. 
 He's late? 
 He called. 
 Medical emergency. 
 Ah. 
 I guess that can't be helped. 
 Thanks for meeting me. 
 What's up? 
 I've just come from a meeting with the town's legal counsel. 
 Your husband. 
 Well, yes. 
 And we can't officially announce it yet, but the zoning request will go through next week. 
 Let our developer friend know that the deal on the Keating House is a go. 
 Congratulations! 
 Thank you. 
 To all of us. (chuckling) 
 But especially to me. 
 Hi! So where did Grace go? 
 Oh, she's studying over at the Bistro with Anthony. 
 Wow, she really knows how to have a fun on a Friday night. 
 She's still upset about that movie. 
 Do you want me to pick her up? 
 Would you? 
 Maybe get her around 10:00? That should give them plenty of time. 
 Yeah. No problem. And maybe I could treat them to pie and ice cream and after, Grace and I could talk big sister to little sister. 
 My treat. 
 I'll tell her. 
 Yeah. 
 (Cassie chuckling) 
 Whoa! 
 Hey. 
 Oh, hey, Stephanie. 
 Hi. 
 How was your dinner? 
 I highly recommend the wine. And the breadsticks. 
 Um... Where's Sam? 
 With Abigail, again. 
 Yikes.

 Abigail? 
 Oh... Sorry. 
 So... 
 Anyway... 
 You. 
 No, no, you. 
 (chuckling) 
 Just go ahead. 
 Why is this so hard? 
 I don't know. 
 But it is, right? 
 But it shouldn't be. 
 No. 
 No. 
 (sigh) So I wanted to tell you that Martha is getting the Keating House property re-zoned, so it looks like the deal is going through. 
 And I wish that you were happy for me. 
 If I thought it would make you happy... 
 You're trying to be someone you're not and that never works. 
 I hate that you don't approve, and I really hate that I need your approval. 
 No, it's not my approval. 
 Yeah, it is. 
 You don't approve of what you're doing and you want someone to tell you it's OK when you know it's not. 
 You're wrong. 
 You want me to be, but that's not the same thing. 
 Can we just order dessert? 
 One chocolate torte, two forks? 
 Finally, something that we can agree on! 
 (sigh) 
 Hey. I'm looking for... 
 Sam? 
 Yes. 
 Yeah, you're late. 
 She didn't want to wait anymore. She left you a note. 
 It's, uh, not good. 
 (sigh) 
 This project could be very good for the town. 
 I thought you didn't want to talk about it? 
 I don't. But you not talking about it is almost worse than you talking about it.

 Oh, hang on a second, I just... 
 I gotta get this. Sorry. 
 (beeping) 
 Hello? Oh, hi! 
 Oh, one second. 
 The late Doctor Sam! (sigh) 
 Hello, Ryan. 
 (sigh) 
 Did not mean to interrupt your date. 
 No. The phone beat you to it. And it's not a date. 
 It's dinner. 
 A note from Stephanie? 
 How could you tell that? 
 Oh, I can feel the angry handwriting from here. 
 You saw her, I take it? 
 Briefly. 
 She was moving pretty quickly. I did not want to get in her way. 
 I called. 
 Where were you? 
 Abigail. She hurt her ankle. 
 Oh. As long as you've got everything handled. 
 I do. 
 Hey! 
 Hey, so, Sam's having a rough night. Do you mind if he joins us for desert? 
 Of course. 
 Thanks. 
 Can I use this chair? 
 But I don't want to interrupt. 
 No. We're all friends, right? 
 Yeah, we're all friends. Yeah... 
 Oh, thanks! 
 So, Sam, what's new? 
 Well, we're gonna need a bigger cake. 
 (chuckling) 
 Yeah. 
 Oh, sure. 
 Thanks. 
 Hi. Coffee with cream, please. 
 Hey. 
 Pie and ice cream on me, compliments of Cassie. Where's Grace? 
 Um, she's, uh... 
 Anthony? 
 Yeah? 
 Where is she? 
 Honestly... I don't know. 
 What do you mean, you don't know? 
 Hey, it's Grace. Leave a message and I'll get right back to you.  (sigh) 
 Well, thanks for letting me crash your... 
 Dinner. 
 I'd invite you back to my place, but I don't want you two to get the wrong idea.

 Can't be too safe, right? 
 Well, Sam was certainly an interesting twist to the evening. 
 It was nice of you to let him join us. He's upset. 
 He really messed it up with Stephanie. 
 What about me? 
 Have I totally messed it up with you? 
 You know, I'm just surprised the deal means as much to you as it does. 
 I thought we were pretty much on the same page with, well, a lot of things. 
 I was talking about us. 
 Should I be hoping for a good night kiss? 
 It was dinner, not a date, remember. 
 Do you kiss everyone you have dinner with good night? 
 As a matter of fact, I do. 
 Oh. 
 Well, in that case. 
 Now that I know your moves, I'll be ready for next time. 
 Oh, you assume there is a next time? 
 Hey, it was just dinner, right? 
 Night. 
 Good night. 
 Grace? 
 She's not with Anthony. I called her cell, but it went straight to voice-mail. I don't know where she is. 
 (sighing)
