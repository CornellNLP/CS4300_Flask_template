 Narrator :  Previously on Good Witch... 
 I have this feeling I can't seem to shake that you're here to stir things up. 
 I know that Nick's in trouble, but he helped me that night. 
 This Keating house development is just the beginning. 
 You want to tear down every building on this list? 
 My ex-wife, she's coming to Middleton. 
 Say that again. 
 Sugar beet juice. 
 Will de-ice my driveway? 
 It's odorless, colorless completely harmless To humans, animals, and plants. 
 Thanks. 
 But that big winter storm is totally gonna miss us. 
 It better. I am totally out of salt for my walkways. 
 And beets. 
 Well, I still think you should prepare. 
 There's definitely a storm on the way. Maybe more than one. 
 Really? Well, if you think so, then it's definitely coming. This could be just what I need To boost my profile. 
 Profile? 
 'Mayorally' speaking I have been unchallenged in crisis. 
 This could be my moment to show the world just what I'm made of. 
 Hey, everybody! 
 Hey! 
 Hey Sam. 
 Hello! 
 Two fried egg sandwiches with cheese and bacon and half a dozen donuts... it's almost up. 
 Now that is a very hearty breakfast. 
 Nick is at the office with me today. Some school thing. 
 And for you, fruit and a plain bagel. 
 Now that's a very boring breakfast. 
 I was thinking I'd drop by tonight after work. 
 Can I get back to you? 
 Sure. 
 Well, I'm off to begin emergency preparations for the storm. 
 And prepare for your close-up? 
 Pardon me? 
 Well, after their big storm last year the Blairsville mayor ended up on the news. 
 I do not do what I do to get on TV. 
 I do it for Middleton. For my people. 
 Well, I'm off to go see a man about A house? 
 A project. 
 I would wish you luck, but I don't think you need it. 
 Thank you. See you soon. 
 (Loud sigh) 
 You know, you really should take some precautions for the storm. 
 Oh, you have a sense something's brewing? 
 Changes in the barometric pressure, wind direction, humidity, all affect our bodies, our nervous systems, our endocrine systems, our cardiovascular systems. 
 That's more than just a sense, it's a warning. 
 There is a 90% probability the storm's going to miss Middleton. 
 That's a fact backed up by the national weather service. 
 Well, "luck favors the prepared". 
 Louis Pasteur. 
 Father of microbiology. 
 You do have an eclectic reading list, don't you? 
 I do. Yeah, he felt that something he couldn't see was making people sick. He couldn't see the germs, but he knew that they were there. 
 Are you saying you're the Louis Pasteur of weather? 
 No, I'm saying there's a storm on the way, a big one. 
 A storm I can handle. My ex-wife, I'm not so sure. 
 Unfortunately, unlike the storm, there is a 100% chance of Linda hitting town tonight and causing complete chaos. 
 (Theme music) 
 Kind of cool having you shadow me today. 
 Really? 
 Yeah. 
 I shadowed dad when I was your age. Mr. riddle? 
 So he hasn't changed that since you were in school? 
 He hasn't changed that since the beginning of time. 
 An original essay with pictures, a day in the life of one of your parents. 
 Well, thank you for being a proxy parent. 
 I'm sure Cassie would have loved to have you at the shop. 
 I need to be with you today. 
 I hope I give you enough to write about. 
 Being a cop in Middleton can be a pretty uneventful. 
 I just don't want to let you down. 
 You won't. And hey, you never know what'll happen, right? 
 No, you don't! 
 And uh, that's what I love about this job. 
 (Door chimes) 
 Eve! 
 Hello, Cassie! 
 How was antiquing in Blairsville? 
 It took us almost 3 hours to get there. 
 It was lovely, Cassie. 
 Sometimes the journey is the destination. 
 You've been such a wonderful hostess we love staying at Grey House, it feels like home. 
 A home where I don't have to clean the kitchen. 
 When's the last time you cleaned the kitchen? 
 Ah... when we were dating. 
 Oh, and that time your mother stopped by. 
 You mean Thanksgiving? 
 Yeah. 
 I rest my case. 
 And what case is that? 
 The case that says I didn't marry you for your kitchen cleaning ability. 
 Of course not. That's why I married you. 
 So, you heading home today? 
 Yeah. 
 We were hoping For a late check-out. 
 Somebody needs a nap. 
 And by somebody, he means him. 
 For your stomach. 
 How did you know? 
 Your eyes. 
 My eyes? 
 They're not just windows into your soul, they're also sometimes windows into your stomach. 
 They're a tinge red, which tells me that something is going on. 
 Really? 
 Truly. 
 It's a powder made from guyabano fruit. 
 It'll help your stomach, especially with a long car ride ahead. We also have an excellent doctor in town. Dr. Sam Radford. 
 He once cracked a rib skiing, he didn't go see a doctor until a week later. 
 I'm hoping our baby doesn't inherit Brian's stubborn gene. 
 What are you looking at? 
 Clouds. 
 According to the weather girl on channel 7, the storm that's heading our way is very powerful, so we need to prepare. 
 They hired her 'cause she's cute. I don't even think she's a meteorologist. In fact, six months ago, I swear she sold me a pair of shoes at that store on main. 
 And why are you wearing that? 
 Oh. He or in this case she, who wears the orange vest, is the one to follow in an emergency situation. I want to make sure that we have everything ready. 
 Oh! 
 Ooh! Remember that big storm last year? 
 That hit Blairsville? 
 Blairsville has all the luck. 
 What is it that you want me to do? 
 I think we need to send out an email alert to all the citizens outlining emergency procedures. 
 Ok. Shoot! 
 Me shoot? 
 Well, it's your memo. 
 Right...? Oh! Right. 
 Um... 
 The mark of good leader is ability to delegate. 
 So I task you with finishing the memo. 
 Who? You? 
 Me... me? 
 Hi, Sam. 
 Abigail. So how's the new job going? 
 I go where I'm needed. 
 So Stephanie needs you? 
 Yeah! 
 Ok, I'm gonna have ah... two mushroom burgers with all the fixings and a shake. 
 Neat trick. 
 If you're looking for Stephanie, she's not here. 
 Oh. 
 But I can leave a message. 
 About your wife coming to town? 
 Ex. 
 And how did you... oh, Cassie. 
 Yeah, sure Cassie. 
 Oh, and Nick wants... 
 Fries. Chili cheese. 
 They're in the bag. 
 Wow! This is gonna be huge for Blairsville. 
 Huge for you, too. A mall provides jobs. 
 That means more people. And those people need houses. 
 Where exactly do I fit in? I mean... now? 
 It's going to be a while before those people who need houses get here. 
 In order to secure the financing from my bank, I have to show to them that the mall will have tenants. 
 Oh, so, that's where I come in, tenants. 
 I need twenty letters of intent from businesses to prove to the bank that these leases will get signed. 
 Twenty? 
 My main office is in Chicago and my local guy here just fell out. 
 Even though Blairsville is only a couple of hours away from Middleton, you'll find yourself on the road a lot. 
 Why me? 
 I've been doing a lot of thinking since the Keating house deal. I like your honesty. 
 Oh, thanks. 
 When I find somebody I can trust, my gut tells me I have to be in business with them. 
 So... if you want in... 
 I want in! 
 Then get me those letters. 
 Will do. 
 Just let me drop off these labs. 
 You want to stop for dinner on the way home? My treat. 
 You're my father, you kind of have to treat. 
 Still, guy's night out. 
 Should we get something for mom? She gets in late. 
 That's a good idea. 
 Why are you looking at me like that? 
 (Cell ringing) 
 I just know you're excited about seeing your mom. 
 Yeah, but she's only here for a couple of nights... 
 Thanks. 
 Ok, should we go to the bistro or the bistro? 
 No. Let's just go home. 
 Grace? 
 Yeah? 
 You're not getting out of the car. 
 Oh. 
 What's up with you today? 
 Wanting to be with me, not wanting to be with Cassie. 
 Can't it just be that I want to spend time with you? 
 It can, but it's not. 
 I need to come with you tomorrow. 
 Need? 
 Want. 
 Look, I'd love that, but I think you have enough material. How about I swing by in the morning and pick you up, ok? I can bring you to the library, you can work on your paper and I'll see if have time for us to do a late lunch tomorrow. 
 Where, maybe you will tell me what you're up to...? 
 Ok. 
 Night. 
 Good night. 
 (Sigh) 
 It's getting cold out there. 
 Smells like snow. 
 I've got soup. 
 Perfect. 
 How's the school project going? 
 Well, Brandon let me blast the siren and showed me how to use a radar gun. 
 Hm, sounds like an interesting beginning. 
 Yeah. 
 Where are Eve and Brian? 
 They just left. 
 You know, I really like them. I hope they come back. 
 They will. 
 Thanks. 
 Smells good. 
 Looks like you have some trouble of your own. 
 You okay? 
 Yeah! 
 But, you don't believe me, do you? 
 Well, I just know you. 
 I'm gonna get us some water. 
 (Knocking) 
 Hey. 
 (Sigh) 
 You want to talk about it? 
 About what? 
 Whatever it is you came over to talk about. 
 All right, all right. I'll tell you what's wrong, stop badgering me. 
 I do, I want to talk. 
 And you hate that. 
 I'm not big on sharing. 
 Just ask my ex-wife's therapist. 
 Oh, umm, Linda's not coming to town. 
 Oh come on, how do you do that? 
 You always know something that you have no way of knowing. 
 And you're calling her Linda? 
 She asked me to. 
 When? 
 When she canceled. 
 Canceled what? 
 Her reservation. 
 She made a reservation here? 
 I run a bed and breakfast. 
 My ex wouldn't stay at a place like this. 
 No offense. 
 She was looking forward to it. 
 Was she? You two chatted? 
 We did. She has a really good sense of humor. 
 No, she doesn't. 
 No, she doesn't. Does she? 
 So you didn't talk to her? 
 You know, just for a moment when she cancelled the reservation and long enough for me to notice she does not have a good sense of humor. 
 But I had you there for a minute, didn't I? 
 And Nick's gonna think it's because of me when it's really because his mother values her business more than spending time with her son. And again, I am left to tell Nick something he doesn't want to hear, which makes me the bad guy. 
 Again. 
 But she really made a reservation? 
 She did, I had a lovely room ready for her. Still do. 
 Hm! 
 Linda? 
 No. It's not her. 
 We were a ways out of town. I thought we should turn back. 
 I think something's wrong. 
 Eve? 
 I'm scared. 
 Should we get to a hospital? Is the baby coming? 
 Oh... oh, not quite yet. It's just some cramping. 
 Can't be Braxton Hicks, too early? 
 Correct. 
 I don't understand. 
 Braxton Hicks are just sort of "practice" contractions. 
 It's just the body's way of getting ready to give birth. 
 But if they'd been real contractions...? 
 Well, that would be a lot more serious at this point in the pregnancy. If that were the case, we'd get Eve to the hospital right away. But it's not. 
 She looks good, and the baby's got a strong steady heartbeat. 
 Cramping's really common and it's nothing to worry about. 
 He's been worried for months. 
 I'm a worrier. 
 That's why he has such a bad stomach. 
 It's true. I guess I need to learn to relax. 
 You do. 
 Agreed. 
 Doctor's orders in fact. 
 I don't know that being on the road is such a good idea. 
 Yeah. I think you two should check back into Grey House, give me a chance to get Eve in the office tomorrow, Run some tests. 
 Well, if you think that's best. 
 I do. And if you need anything at all, remember I'm just right next door. 
 Literally. (Little laughs) 
 Excuse me. (Long sigh) 
 I've seen a lot of nervous expectant fathers, but our friend Brian must be in the top five. 
 What? 
 Well, I wonder if we shouldn't get them to a hospital just to be safe? 
 I have learned to respect your intuition, but when it comes to this I have to act on fact, tangible facts. 
 Now, there is nothing going on with Eve that warrants a trip to the E.R. 
 Or a hospital stay. I think you're off this time. 
 Happens to the best of us. 
 I'll check back in tomorrow morning. 
 Bye. 
 Good night. 
 You're still awake. 
 Doing homework? 
 Mom's stuck in New York, she's not coming. She texted. 
 Yeah, I was gonna tell you in the morning. 
 Don't sweat it, dad. 
 It's mom. I didn't really think she was going to come. 
 She could fly in tomorrow. 
 She only had a day and a half before she had to be in Hong Kong. She's not coming. 
 What'd you say you and I do something tomorrow, anything you want. Name it. 
 I want to move back to New York. 
 Morning. 
 Hey. 
 Brought your paper. 
 Man, it's cold out there. 
 Didn't you hear the latest. 
 The weather people say that the winter storm will definitely miss Middleton. My ex on the other hand has already made a direct hit. 
 Nick's really upset. And since he can't take it out on her... 
 He takes it out on you. 
 We always hurt the ones we love. 
 He must really love me. 
 He does. 
 So is he going to the office with you today? 
 He's at the library working on his paper. 
 Really? 
 Yeah, it threw me, too. 
 Naturally I assumed he was pulling a fast one. 
 But he convinced me that, given the choice between disinfecting exam rooms and sitting in a comfortable library, he'd choose the latter. So, how's my patient? 
 Oh, she had trouble sleeping last night so I gave her some warm milk with cherries and fermented camomile. 
 Always worked for me. 
 Fermentation allows for quicker absorption. 
 You don't say. 
 I do say. But you don't believe. 
 I'm going to get Eve into the office and I'll run some blood, do a full physical, if there's something wrong with her, I'll find it and treat it. 
 Scouts honor. I was, by the way. 
 Eagle scout. 
 (Little chuckle) 
 Hi. 
 Hi. 
 I missed you at school. 
 My dad got a new job and new apartment in Davenport. 
 Oh! 
 Yeah, I was staying with him. 
 Are you moving away? 
 My parents are just trying to figure out custody. 
 They both want me full time. 
 Well, if you live with your dad, then when will I see you? 
 Even when I'm here, you seem to be doing other stuff with other people, so... 
 Anthony, look, I know that you're still upset about that whole... 
 Lying to me, using me as cover with your family while you'd go hang out with Nick. 
 I wasn't hanging with Nick. 
 Hey, look, it's simple, you want to be friends with Nick, you don't want to be friends with me. 
 All I'm saying is it couldn't hurt to jazz up the menu a little bit. Some nouvelle cuisine? 
 The soup is "nouvelle" every day. 
 What? 
 Well, if you don't like my ideas about the menu, you're going to hate my plans to  feng shui  the restaurant. 
 Last week she's working for Sam, this week she's working for Stephanie? 
 And I thought Stephanie wasn't that crazy for Abigail because Abigail was a bit crazy for Sam. 
 Well, if she's working for her... 
 Then she can't work for Sam. Makes sense. 
 Yeah, I think Abigail feels she's needed here in Middleton. 
 What do you feel? 
 In her own unique way, she means well. 
 She's trouble. 
 She's family. 
 Yes, but sometimes, family can be trouble. 
 Ryan. 
 Yes.? 
 Just tell me the thing you don't want to tell me. 
 The developer from Keating house he wants to build a mall in Blairsville and he wants me to be part of it. 
 What'd you think? 
 Well, I'm not a big fan of malls. 
 I know. But can you imagine the kind of business that another Bell, Book and Candle Could do in a location like that. 
 You can't franchise what I do. 
 You don't you want to share that with other people? 
 What makes Bell, Book and Candle special is I get to personally deal with every person who comes in. 
 I get to know them. I find out about their problems, their needs. Middleton's my little corner of the world, I like it like that. 
 Bigger isn't always better, it's just bigger. 
 If I get this project, it's gonna mean spending a lot more time away from Middleton. 
 Well, I always think what's important is not where we spend our time but how we intend on spending it. 
 I think I've been pretty clear on how and with whom I would like to spend my time. 
 So, um, have you broken the news yet to Martha that you are planning on helping build A mall in Blairsville? 
 Do I have to? 
 We often ask a question we already know the answer to when we don't like the answer. 
 Do I have to? 
 Blairsville is getting a mall!? Are you kidding me!? 
 Martha. 
 Sorry. 
 How could you do that to our town? How could you do that to me?  Et tu,  Brutus,  et tu? 
 It's  brute. 
 Whatever. It's you. 
 I didn't go looking for it, Martha it just sort of happened. 
 Well, I am not pleased with you Ryan Elliott, not one bit. 
 First, you give the development project to Blairsville, and now, a mall, too...? 
 Well, the mall hasn't happened yet. There's still a lot of work to be done. 
 Well, then I will just have to root for you to fail. 
 I know. Speaking of things that haven't happened yet, this is army surplus... 
 And it's expired. You don't need this Martha. 
 There. Will. Be. A. Storm! 
 Oh, Blairsville can have their little mall, but this storm belongs to Middleton and to me. 
 Ok! 
 Well, I guess I'm just gonna have to hope for a major snow storm to hit and cripple the town. 
 Well, you better. (Megaphone siren) 
 Thank you. 
 
 
 
 Hello there, neighbor. 
 Hey, how's Eve? 
 Ah! You tell me. 
 Well, I just got off the phone with the lab, and the blood work looks good. But I suggested they stay one more night, head out in the morning. 
 She's ok. 
 Yeah, just because we don't see it, doesn't mean it's not there. 
 And sometimes, we don't see it because it's not there. 
 You really think there's something I can't see? 
 Something a test can't detect? That an exam can't uncover? 
 Yes. 
 What? 
 Something's off. 
 Hello. 
 Hi! 
 I thought it was only Cassie that did that trick. 
 Where are you off to? 
 Bistro for coffee, then work. 
 New work, right? 
 Yeah. 
 Sounds like a real opportunity. 
 It is. 
 Did Cassie tell you? 
 I'm pretty good at figuring things out on my own. 
 I'll bet you are. 
 Shall we? So tell me about your job... 
 I... give up. What is it? 
 My anniversary present. 
 You're getting a... 
 An AMRAP. 
 A mine resistant ambush protected vehicle. They can get through anything: Downed trees, floods, snow, ice. 
 Don't they use those in the military? 
 Which means Middleton can get a used one at a very good price. 
 Well, that's a very large and expensive present from your husband. 
 I'm a lucky woman. 
 And you think we need one of these? 
 Blairsville has a police boat. 
 But they're on a river. 
 Martha, I just don't think our town needs a... a tank. 
 It's not a tank! 
 Look, it's got doors. 
 I think it's less about the power of the vehicle and more about the power of the person driving the vehicle, don't you? 
 Well yes... 
 Oh. Oh. 
 I'll be right with you. 
 Hi. 
 Hi. 
 How's your paper coming? 
 Done. 
 What's it about? 
 You ask a lot of questions. 
 It's called a conversation. 
 One-way. 
 And why is that? 
 (Door chimes) 
 What are we looking at? 
 The storm. 
 It's clear. 
 Yeah, not for long. 
 There's a big shift. I can feel it. 
 Yeah. So, speaking of shifts or "shifty"... Abigail. 
 Something wrong at the store? 
 No... 
 So, what is it? 
 Ryan. 
 I think she's doing the same thing she did to me last week with Sam, to Ryan. 
 Working her... magic. 
 But you asked her to work for you, right? 
 Well, I couldn't keep letting her work with Sam, now, could I? 
 She's driving me crazy, by the way. 
 She keeps trying to change everything at the bistro: The menu, the food, the room, just everything. 
 Well, if it isn't the right fit... 
 You know, she keeps saying she's only at the bistro for me. 
 I'm sure she has her reasons. 
 That's what worries me. 
 (Door chimes) 
 I've heard from three small businesses that want to discuss letters of intent. 
 Oh, that's great. 
 Now I just need to know what your intentions are? 
 Hmm? 
 The next step would have you spending a fair amount of time in Blairsville. Would that be a problem? 
 No, not a problem. 
 But your home is here. 
 And my job, I hope, is with you and this project. 
 Good to hear. 
 Thanks. 
 See you tonight. 
 Take care. 
 I wanted to talk to you. 
 I wanted to talk to you. 
 Yeah? 
 Yeah, this isn't working out for me. 
 Excuse me? 
 I quit. 
 Excuse me? 
 I quit. 
 But I was going to... 
 You were going to fire me? 
 Yes. No. I mean... 
 You just started. 
 So what? 
 You were going to fire me. 
 Still... 
 Today will be my last day. 
 (Sigh) 
 Hey there. 
 Hi! 
 How's Eve? 
 She's resting. 
 Hmm. 
 Pregnancy is lovely in so many ways, but one of the best things is that it forces you to take care of yourself. 
 Because another life is literally dependent on you. 
 Hm. 
 You nervous about her? 
 No. 
 Well, you seem like a natural. 
 You're gonna do great. Being a father. 
 But you doubt yourself. 
 Well, I just didn't have a great role model growing up. 
 My dad wasn't around much when I was young and he took off when I was in high school. So... and it was a surprise when Eve found out she was pregnant, so... 
 Not a lot of time to adjust and figure things out. 
 Well, parenting is really just about taking care of someone other than yourself. The first rule of taking care of others, is taking care of yourself. 
 My stomach? 
 It's a good start. 
 Have you seen a doctor? 
 No, no I haven't had time. 
 I own my own business. 
 So you really are a father already then? 
 Yeah, I guess I am. 
 Well, just a few drops, it's mostly ginger. Works for me. 
 Thanks. 
 Just remember, I'm not the only one in town who might be able to help you. Dr. Radford is right next door. 
 Yeah, thanks Cassie, but... no thanks. 
 Yeah, that's great. 
 Not a problem. Yeah, thank you. Alright, it's official. We're going to get hit with the storm. 
 Middleton? Really? 
 Yeah. 
 We never get hit. 
 Well, it changed course. 
 It's headed straight for us. 
 Just like Cassie thought. 
 Snow? 
 Yeah, snow. Snow, ice, sleet. This is a trifecta of bad news, alright? Why don't you start getting the road closure signs together and I'm going to send out an emergency email blast. 
 You do realize this town is not properly prepared for any sort of disaster, right? 
 I am well aware of that, Brandon, alright? 
 But we a going to need help. Look on the bright side, the mayor's gonna get the storm she wanted. 
 (Phone ringing) 
 Mayor Martha Tinsdale. 
 Yes. Oh! 
 Yes, thank you, Chief Sanders. 
 Please enact the first phase of my safety plan. 
 I will be right in. 
 Yes! We're getting a great big storm! 
 Oh! Yes, Chief? 
 We don't have a safety plan. 
 We certainly do, I wrote it myself. 
 Yeah, the first thing on your list is to call the president and then bring in the national guard to enact a curfew. 
 This is not about... 
 Safety plans anymore. This is not about orange emergency vests. 
 What is this about? 
 You being wrong and me being right. 
 Alright, ok, just go ahead, say it, get it over with. 
 I told you so. 'I' told 'you' so! 
 Yes you did. Alright, now that that's all settled do you mind if I go take care of the town? 
 Oh, well, yes, of course. 
 Meanwhile, I'm gonna write my speech. I think I should give it from atop a snowplow. 
 That's very Patton-esque. 
 Thank you. 
 Maybe I've misjudged him. 
 (Sigh) 
 Hey. How's it going out there? 
 It's pretty slick. It came down so fast. 
 It's not so bad. 
 I was on a call, I found her walking home in this weather. 
 I love weather. 
 Do you love frostbite? 
 Weather loves me too, it never bites. 
 [Brandon, you need to start closing roads. Over.] 
 Copy that. 
 [Looks like our snow storm] 
 [has turned into an ice storm, a big one.] 
 [It's already started to freeze over.] 
 Copy that. 
 Grace. 
 She's at the library. 
 Right. With Nick. 
 I'll pick them up after I block the roads. 
 If I can't get them back here, I'll bring them to the station until the roads are clear. Can you tell Sam? 
 Yeah, I will. 
 Can I get a ride into town? 
 You just got here. 
 Left something at the bistro. 
 Is it that important? 
 Yes! Yes, it is. 
 Alright, but it might be a while before I get back to you. 
 No problem. 
 Stay inside. And, uh, tell your guests, too. 
 Yeah. Be careful. 
 (Sigh) 
 Aah! 
 (Whimper) 
 So Jones made me an offer today. 
 What kind of an offer? 
 The kind of offer that may be hard to turn down. 
 Hey! 
 Hey. 
 Hey! 
 Am I interrupting? 
 No! No, come on in. 
 Ah, thanks for the message about Nick. 
 Oh yeah. 
 I should go. 
 It's getting really bad out there... 
 You should stay. 
 All the bad weather is south of Blairsville and I've got to meet Jones, so I got a hotel room. 
 I'm gonna drive home tomorrow morning when roads are clear. 
 And you look worried. 
 Of course I'm worried. 
 I like that. 
 A lot. 
 See you, Doc! 
 See ya. 
 (Sigh) 
 I did interrupt. 
 What can I do for you? 
 How's Eve today? 
 She seems to be doing well. 
 But...? 
 Did Brian come to see you? 
 About Eve? 
 No, about him. 
 I don't have a lot to cure what ails him. 
 Nervous father to be is kind of like a fever; have to let it run its course. 
 Hm. 
 But you don't think so. 
 What I think is that... 
 It's time for dinner. An early dinner. Join me? 
 Cao lau.  My own recipe. 
 Eh... 
 It's a classic Vietnamese dish. 
 Ah... 
 Pork and noodles. 
 Real pork or some vegan pork-like substitute? 
 Real pork. 
 I should have just said yes, shouldn't I? 
 Yeah. You should have said yes. Are you saying yes? 
 Yes. Bring on the cao lau! 
 (Quiet snicker) 
 There's a problem with my sitter. 
 I don't want to leave you but I have to get my daughter. 
 Just stay here and I will be right back. 
 Uh, it's ok, my brother is going to come get us. 
 Brandon? 
 Yes. 
 All of you? 
 Yes. 
 Alright. I'm still going to come back though, make sure you get out alright. 
 Thank you. 
 Now what? 
 (Sigh) 
 I don't know. 
 I wasn't talking to you. 
 I was talking to Grace. 
 I don't know, Anthony. 
 I guess we just wait for Brandon. 
 Looks like I've a new reason to hate the library. 
 Brandon... 
 (Tires skidding and impact) 
 This is officer Russell, come in. 
 Reporting a 10-50. I've been in an accident. 
 (Static) 
 Cassie? 
 Cassie. 
 Eve, what's wrong? 
 Are you ok? 
 It's not me. 
 Brian. 
 Hi. 
 What are you doing back here? 
 I forgot something. 
 What? 
 You! 
 He's cold. 
 But sweaty. How's his pulse? 
 Thready. 
 Fast. 
 On a scale from one to five, what's your pain level like. 
 A two, a three... 
 It really hurts. 
 Can you tell me where? 
 Just my stomach. 
 Ok, I'm going to put my hand here, really gently. 
 You tell me if the pain increases, ok? 
 (Whimper) Sorry. 
 Yeah. 
 What is it? What's wrong with him? 
 We need to get him out of here to figure that out. Ok? 
 Ok. 
 We'll go and check on getting an ambulance. 
 And you just stay with Brian. And keep him calm. 
 I can do that. 
 And you stay calm too. 
 Because everything is going to be ok. 
 Yeah, this is Dr. Radford, we're gonna need an ambulance. 
 Grey house. Now! No... ok. 
 No, I get it. Yeah, thanks, just hurry. 
 It's the weather. They don't know how soon they can get out here. 
 What do you think it is? 
 Blockage... appendix... 
 Some kind of internal bleeding. But I need a hospital and a lab to be sure. I need to get a look inside him to really see what's going on. 
 Could he be going into shock? He's cold but sweaty, rapid heartbeat. I'm guessing he had low blood pressure? 
 Yeah... he could, but it's what's causing the shock we need to worry about. 
 Everything I listed requires surgery and delaying that is just going to mean more complications for Brian. 
 We don't have much time. We have to keep him stable. 
 And we do have to get him to the hospital. 
 This is bad.
