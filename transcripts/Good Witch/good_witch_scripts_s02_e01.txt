 Ah... 
 Need some help? I can go change clothes. 
 Thanks. I actually enjoy doing yard work. It's relaxing. 
 (laughing) Gotta be honest, Never liked yard work, even when I was a kid. Living in New York, it just consisted of sweeping the leaves off my balcony onto the balcony below. 
 Here, I got it. 
 Ah, thanks. Well, ever since I was a kid, this is exactly what I wanted. 
 To rake leaves? 
 Haha! Yeah. 
 This is the first home I've had. 
 Really? 
 Yeah. My parents died; I went into foster care. Lots of temporary homes. 
 I always wanted a big house like this, but with the big house comes... 
 Big leaves. 
 Yeah, exactly. 
 (Cassie sighing) 
 You know, Nick could help with the yard. 
 He takes after me. 
 Doesn't like yard work? 
 Like father, like son. 
 Well, you can always wait for the first snow and then... 
 Voilà, no more leaves! 
 Sam, um... 
 Yeah? 
 At the festival, you said we needed to talk. 
 OK, um... 
 I wanted to talk to you about that night at your store. 
 After the party? 
 I wanted to kiss you... and I thought maybe you wanted to kiss me too. 
 I need to know... if I'm imagining this thing that seems to be between us. 
 You're not. 
 Good. 
 But things are complicated for you now, for both of us. 
 Hey, Linda. 
 Sam. Cassie. 
 Nick is asking for you. He's inside with me. 
 Hmm, term paper. 
 Yes. 
 No one knows more about early American history than Sam. 
 I'm not surprised. 
 Later? 
 Hmm. 
 I'm sorry, did I interrupt something? 
 Just talking. 
 Haha! You are a chatty one, aren't you? 
 You know it's funny because Sam usually hates that. 
 Hmm. Well, he seems to enjoy our conversations. 
 ♪♪♪ 
 (theme music) 
 ♪♪♪ 
 Wow! 
 This is even nicer than on the website. 
 I told you, I've got a good feeling about this place. 
 Beth, Larry? 
 Welcome to Grey House. We've been expecting you. 
 Oh, your home is beautiful. 
 Well, for the next few days, it's your home too. 
 We love hosting weddings here at Grey House. 
 It's our version of eloping. 
 Just a small group of friends are coming. 
 Your dress arrived yesterday, so if you need any last-minute alterations, we have a wonderful seamstress in town. 
 Such a beautiful dress. 
 Oh, you've seen it? 
 I helped pick it out. 
 We do everything together. 
 Since we met. 
 Hmm... 
 Well, here you go. 
 Oh! Uh... 
 What's this? 
 There was a mix-up with your room and the date we had you booked in. We're full. The only rooms I have left are singles. 
 Uh, I don't know about this. We're sort of the couple that does everything together. 
 Yeah. 
 Well, don't worry. I promise, in this case: distance won't make things worse, it will make things better. 
 Uh, George can help you to your room. 
 Oh-oh, no, that's OK. Uh, we'll find them. 
 Yeah, we wanted to take a look around anyway. Haha! OK. 
 (door opening) 
 They seem like a happy couple. 
 (door closing) 
 Certainly seems that way. 
 So after I adopted Scooter from the shelter, 
 I signed up for this free training class. I've never had a dog before, so... 
 Did you learn anything? 
 Yes! Apparently, I love my dog too much. 
 (phone ringing) 
 How can you do that? 
 He said I'm doing everything wrong. 
 The dog thinks he's in charge. 
 He said that? 
 He did, yeah. 
 (dial tone) 
 Oh! They'll call back. 
 Hahaha! 
 Here. Just call me tomorrow if you're not breathing better. 
 Thanks, Dr. Radford. Bye, Eve. 
 Bye, sweetie. See you soon. 
 She invited me to join her book club. 
 I need your services immediately. 
 Have a seat, Martha. I'll squeeze you in. 
 Squeeze me? You don't squeeze in the elected mayor of this town who's experiencing a dire medical emergency. 
 (phone ringing) 
 Dr. Radford's office! 
 I'll be in exam room 2. 
 It has better art. 
 I had chicken pox when I was 7. 
 Mm-hmm. Are you itchy? 
 Even your eyeballs. 
 OK, let's get you an appointment. 
 (people chattering) 
 ♪♪♪ 
 You're looking for help? 
 In a way, yeah. 
 Well, you know who has a great employee? 
 Stephanie. Have you noticed the bistro's business has doubled since I started? 
 Yeah, everyone does love to eat there. 
 But they love it more since I started working there. 
 I've clearly built up her business and made it thrive. 
 Well, that's one way to look at it, but it's not the only way to look at it. 
 I have a lot of regulars. 
 People would eat somewhere else if it wasn't for me. 
 Yes, you do have a loyal following. 
 They are loyal. If I left, they'd leave too. 
 Why would you leave? I thought you liked working there, and you and Stephanie are getting closer. 
 She couldn't run the place without my help. 
 I deserve more for all I'm bringing to her business. 
 I'm ready for the next step. 
 So you want to be your own boss? 
 Well, like a partner. 
 Yeah. 
 Stephanie should make me a partner in the Bistro. 
 You know, you could start by asking her to give you more responsibility. 
 Why would I do that? 
 Because asking her to be partners is a very big step. 
 Not if she doesn't want to lose half her business. 
 Yes! 
 Are you taking me to a movie? 
 I don't like movies. 
 Who doesn't like movies? 
 Did you get reservations to Sookie? 
 If you did, you're magician. 
 That place has been booked solid for weeks. 
 Sookie? 
 Yeah, that new seafood place in Blairsville. 
 Oh no, I don't like fish. 
 (scoffing): OK. 
 Are you taking me to Chicago? 
 (both laughing) 
 Unless you want to meet my parents. 
 I'm kidding. It's our second date. 
 Well, just tell me then. 
 I want to take you camping. 
 Separate sleeping bags of course. 
 Wow! Camping. 
 I've never been. 
 Oh, you're gonna love it. 
 The lights of Chicago have nothing on the stars. 
 You know, I would love to go, really, I would, but, um... 
 Remember how I was telling you about my plans to expand the business? 
 Well, the investor really wants a tour of the space. 
 Oh, we could go after. 
 We could. Haha! 
 You really don't want to go, do you? 
 I suppose I could get away for one night. 
 I promise you'll have fun. 
 Camping... right. 
 Nice of you to help, Tara. 
 Oh yeah. Brandon's working tonight. 
 I saw Grace coming in. 
 I can't believe she's old enough to get her driver's license. 
 No matter how old she gets, she will always be my baby. 
 (Tara chuckling) 
 Oh! 
 Oh! 
 Oh, I'm so sorry! 
 No, it's OK. 
 (Tara sighing) No, it's not. 
 It's not about the salad. 
 I think I might be pregnant. 
 Tara! 
 I'm freaking out. 
 It's such a big thing having a baby, being a mother. 
 It's gonna be OK. 
 I'm not so sure. 
 Brandon and I haven't even discussed kids since before we were married. 
 And even then, it was so far away, it just didn't feel real. 
 I just... I can't handle this. I'm-I'm not ready. 
 Have you told Brandon? 
 I wanted to wrap my head around it first. 
 Well, the nice thing about being married is you're never alone; you always have a partner. 
 You and Brandon can handle whatever life throws at you if you do it together. 
 (insects chirping) 
 ♪♪♪ 
 woman : Am I in your way? 
 Oh no, it's a big table. 
 Oh, you know what? I need to pack up. 
 I've got to get dinner ready for my boys. 
 Oh, what are you making? 
 Takeout. Hahaha! 
 The place on Clover? 
 No. You know what? I've actually found, um, another place in the next town over. 
 Oh! 
 Cassie. 
 Yeah? 
 Thank you for giving my family some space. 
 And I hope I didn't come across too harshly when I asked you to back off a little. 
 I understand completely. 
 It's working. 
 My being here. Nick is thriving. 
 Well, it's great he's doing so well. 
 It's because he's part of a cohesive unit. 
 Having both of his parents present, it's really making a difference. 
 That's wonderful. 
 It is wonderful. 
 And I'm glad that you and I agree. 
 You take care of your family, and I'll take care of mine. Hm! 
 Thanks again. 
 (sigh) 
 ♪♪♪ 
 This is great! 
 We can eat at my house. Cassie's got enough guests to cook for. 
 Oh, don't be silly. 
 Cassie, do you have any of that fresh-squeezed juice I like? 
 I'm sorry, Cassie. 
 She doesn't mind. 
 I don't. 
 I do! 
 Sam, you're a gentleman. 
 You're all welcome to breakfast anytime. 
 You are so sweet, thank you. 
 Oh, just a little heads-up: your French toast is just a bit on the dry side today. 
 Always open to feedback. 
 So, are you ready for your basketball tryout? 
 It's not a tryout; it's a game. 
 Yeah, well, I'm looking forward to seeing you play. 
 So am I. Hey, you know, we could ride over together. 
 That'd be good, but we won't. 
 Oh, come on, I can swing by and pick you up from work. 
 No need to swing, Linda. 
 But thanks. 
 Hey, Cassie, do you want to come? 
 Yeah, come! 
 Oh, you know, Cassie is so busy, I'm sure she can't make it. 
 You know, I don't have anyone to cover for me at the store. 
 Oh no. Darn! Hmm! 
 You are really a great cook, Cassie. 
 Thanks for this. 
 Sure. You know, I could share my recipes with you. 
 Oh no, thank you. 
 If you change your mind... 
 I won't. Haha! 
 Cassie said you should be my... partner? 
 Look, I am happy to have you work here as an employee... 
 I mean, you just started working for me, and your restaurant experience is, well, limited. 
 I mean, I can certainly give you more to do, but I think it's a little early to be talking about taking you on as a partner. 
 I really need you here at the Bistro. 
 Look, I found an investor who is considering helping me with my plans to expand. 
 I want to add a catering storefront in that newly vacated space down the street. 
 That's a very big deal! 
 It is, which is why I need an investor. 
 For a small percentage of the business, I can get all the working capital I need. 
 But I need you to keep things shipshape here while I get that business up and running. 
 It looks like we have our work cut out for us, don't we? 
 (Stephanie giggling) 
 ♪♪♪ 
 Do you mind if we fill up our water bottles? 
 Oh, help yourself. 
 We're heading out to Halter Falls for a hike. Great suggestion. 
 Such a special place. 
 You know, I just love hiking. 
 You know, communing with nature. 
 Yeah, me too. 
 What about you, Larry? 
 It's, uh, a good workout. 
 Oh, um, before you head out, the florist called about your flowers. 
 Oh, is there a problem? 
 I am afraid so. 
 Their cooler broke down last night, and they lost most of their inventory. 
 Can we call another florist? I'll pay whatever it takes. Ha! 
 You want your bride to be happy. 
 How lucky am I? 
 Ha! 
 I'll see what I can do. 
 Please. 
 Sure. 
 Oh, also before you head out, one more thing. 
 Cake: traditional layer with rosettes? 
 Bakery just called to confirm. 
 Traditional all the way, that's us. 
 That's what we agreed to. 
 I've seen a lot of engaged couples, and most have at least a few disagreements over the wedding, but not you two. 
 Hmm! 
 Aaaaaah! 
 I'm receiving a pretty prestigious award from the Middleton Small Business Association at the end of the week, and an acceptance speech is mandatory. 
 (phone ringing) 
 Aaah... 
 I'm talking about croaking like a bullfrog, and I've been practicing for two weeks solid. 
 I told you yesterday, you have to rest your voice. 
 I did! Ahem! 
 Except for all the practicing. 
 Well... 
 It's definitely gotten worse. You officially have laryngitis. 
 But how is that possible? 
 Well, either you have an upper respiratory infection or acid reflux or you've been talking too much. 
 I'm going to bet on door number 3. 
 Well, make it go away. 
 I can't. But you can. 
 You have to rest your voice. No talking. 
 (Martha gasping) 
 I want to see you back tomorrow. 
 But... but what about my speech?! 
 I don't know what to tell you, Martha. 
 Either you rest your voice or you risk losing it completely. 
 Well, thank you... but no thank you. 
 This whole voice thing is nothing that a strong dose of herbal tea won't take care of. 
 Just because you don't like what I say doesn't make it any less true. 
 (phone ringing) 
 Hmm! 
 I saw your sign. 
 It kind of spoke of me. 
 So you're a waitress. 
 I am. 
 I just love being around different people every day. 
 And a vet tech? 
 Oh, I love animals. 
 And you work in a bakery. 
 Uh, part time. 
 I-I just have loved baking ever since I was a little girl. 
 I read an article about a woman who started her own organic pet food store. 
 She makes everything from scratch. 
 No. Why, I can't make a living baking for animals. 
 Cassie : You know, pet food is a billion-dollar industry. 
 Billion? 
 And growing. 
 (redhead woman sighing) 
 Time is precious. 
 If you only have time to choose one new venture in life, you can never go wrong choosing something you love. 
 Thanks. 
 I almost didn't come in here. 
 It was your sign in the window. 
 Good luck, Megan. Hm! 
 Did you tell Abigail I should make her my partner? 
 No, she told me! 
 I don't know what she's thinking. 
 Well, she's definitely thinking up something. 
 Hmm... Well, I'm glad she took it well when I told her no. 
 Abigail?! 
 (both chuckling) 
 I know. I was a little surprised too. 
 Oh... I find with Abigail that what she says and what she means are often two very different things. 
 But I am very clear and was very clear: no partnership, period. 
 Good. 
 (Stephanie sighs.) 
 What's this? 
 It's a natural oil that repels bugs. 
 Did Ben tell you he's taking me camping? 
 No, you did. 
 Oh! 
 Everything in that store is plaid. 
 It was very visually upsetting. 
 Oh, I think it's sweet. He wants to share something he loves with you. 
 Ugh, I only said yes 'cause I didn't want to upset him. 
 We just started dating. 
 Just remember that being open to new things is what brought Ben into your life. 
 I will be open. 
 But if I turn into a free-lunch buffet for a bunch of hungry mosquitoes, it's over. 
 Sounds fair. 
 Sounds itchy. 
 (both laughing) 
 woman : Thank you very much. 
 man : Yeah, thank you. 
 He says he loves me and he is so cute, but you know what I did last night? 
 Watched football again! Football! 
 I mean, he may love me, but he loves Tom Brady more. 
 Ahem! 
 
 
 
 Hi, Dr. Radford. 
 Hi. Can I have a word with you privately? 
 Sure! Give me a sec. 
 Yeah. 
 What's up, Doc? 
 Um... I think maybe some of the patients are a little... put off by your... familiarity. 
 Can we just have a moratorium on the gossip? I like a quiet office; I don't want the patients to be uncomfortable. 
 Josie, sweetie, am I making you uncomfortable? 
 Ha! Please! 
 She's fine. 
 Yeah. I'm not. 
 (softly): Oh. 
 I guess you're making me uncomfortable. 
 Doctors' offices are supposed to be professional. 
 It's what I'm used to. 
 Consider me on mute. 
 I'll stop talking. 
 Now. 
 (birds singing) 
 Thank you for doing this, Mom. 
 Alright. I have to admit... 
 What? 
 Well, your dad, this was kind of his department. 
 Yeah. 
 I remember him teaching me how to ride a bike. 
 And then he took off the training wheels. 
 Ouch! 
 (Cassie laughing) 
 (both sighing) 
 OK, you're ready? 
 I am. Are you? 
 Yes. 
 OK. 
 Oh! 
 What? 
 Slow down. 
 I'm going the speed limit. 
 You're going a little fast. 
 Hmm... nope. 
 See? 
 (bike bell ringing) 
 That guy on the bike is passing us. 
 Well, speaking of bikes, you're a little close, don't you think? 
 No, I think I'm giving him plenty of room. 
 Just give him a little more. 
 (sighing): Mom! Seriously! 
 Don't look at me, look at the road. 
 I'm sorry. If you could just relax for a second. 
 I've read the manual forwards and backwards. 
 Have you read the manual? No, you have not. 
 Yes, I have. 
 Yes, when you were, like, 15. 
 That was a long time ago. 
 (Cassie sighing) 
 I'm sorry, that was mean. 
 Look, I am right and you are wrong. 
 I was the correct distance behind the bike, and I would bet my life on it. Really, to be honest. And if I had to say... 
 Oh! Oh, Grace! 
 What? 
 (sigh) 
 Where are you going? 
 I'm going to turn in my learner's permit... and buy a bus pass. 
 Well, this is no ordinary date. 
 Hmm? 
 Exhibit A: you let me pick the movie, sci-fi, when I know you wanted to see that new romantic comedy. 
 Exhibit B: you let me pick the restaurant. 
 You hate Greek. And exhibit C, to bring it all home, here we are at the Bistro for chocolate cake. 
 My favourite chocolate cake. 
 Well... I love you. 
 Well, I love you too. 
 But seriously, what's up? 
 (Tara sighs.) 
 I'm late. 
 Like late, late? 
 I think I might be pregnant. 
 (indistinct conversations) 
 (Ben laughing) 
 That's funny. You-you had me there. 
 It's not a joke? 
 Are you actually gonna have a baby? 
 Maybe. 
 How did this happen? 
 (scoffing) No, I mean, uh... 
 You know what I mean. Did you take a test? 
 No, but I'm tired all the time, I'm super hungry, and I just feel... different. 
 (exhaling) 
 Are you as freaked out about this as I am? 
 More. 
 I don't think that's possible. 
 Ha! I'm the one who has to go through childbirth. 
 OK, maybe it's possible.

 (door closing) 
 I see you're looking for help! 
 I am! 
 Business is good? 
 Well, it's time for Bell, Book & Candle to reach a broader audience. 
 And that requires an additional employee. 
 For what I have in mind? Yes. 
 How interesting. Anyway, I am desperately in need of your help. My voice is going, and our resident doctor has prescribed a horrible regimen: he wants me to stop talking. 
 Sounds like good advice. Ha! 
 I will not be silenced. 
 I have a speech to give, and the show must go on, as they say. So, give me all of it: every herb, every elixir, every flower that you have. 
 If it will cure my throat, I'm game. 
 I'm happy to help, Martha, but Sam already gave you a diagnosis, and it's probably in your best interest to take his advice. 
 He's a QUACK! Ahem! 
 He is an accredited physician. 
 He doesn't know everything. 
 He graduated top of his class in medical school. 
 Doctor Internet is all I need. Oh, and you of course. 
 I know it doesn't look like much,  but it's got great bones. I can fit two industrial ovens back there, and I still have room for a reach-in cooler and a walk-in freezer. There's plenty of space for a prep station right here, and I plan to rent to own gently-used equipment. 
 That way, she doesn't pay for any depreciation. 
 Right. 
 So, what do you think, Dale? 
 I think we're both gonna make a lot of money. 
 (Stephanie laughing) 
 (cell phone ringing) Oh, excuse me. 
 This is Stephanie. No. 
 Abigail : This space has such potential, doesn't it? No. Don't accept the delivery if it's wrong. OK. I'll be right there. 
 I gotta get back. Can we meet later? 
 We have a lot to discuss. 
 And celebrate. 
 Yes. 
 So, what do you think of all this? 
 I do have some thoughts. 
 I'd love to hear them. 
 Over wine or dinner? 
 How about we start with wine and move on to dinner? 
 I like that plan. 
 Thank you for doing this, Brandon. 
 Seriously, Mom drove me crazy. 
 Well, I taught Lori how to drive; I think I can handle you. 
 (chuckling) Keys. 
 Did you know that we're sitting in a weapon right now? 
 What?! 
 A car is 2-ton mobile weapon. 
 OK. I love you, but right now, you're not making any sense. 
 I want you to understand the gravity of the situation, Grace. 
 Driving is a responsibility; it's not a right. You have to earn these. 
 (Grace sighs.) 
 You know I can sense things before they happen? 
 Yeah... 
 This lesson... not going to end well. 
 Grace! 
 (insects chirping) 
 (birds calling) 
 Stephanie, you have nothing to be embarrassed about. 
 I mean, with the light and the shadows, it could've easily have been a bear. 
 Oh, yucks! Except it was a racoon. 
 Well, racoons can be very dangerous. 
 That shirt looks better on you than it ever did on me. 
 If I hadn't dropped my bag in the lake... 
 Ah, everything will be dry by morning. 
 Maybe we should just go home.

 What are you talking about? Cassie's not a threat! 
 She's a good, kind, compassionate person. And more than anyone else, she helped Nick and me get settled in this town.

 (squeaky whispering): Don't you dare walk away from me! 
 (sighing) 
 No! 
 (door opening) 
 (Larry sniffing) 
 Oh, I have organic sunscreen if you ran out. 
 Oh, uh, I probably can't use them; I'm allergic to everything, including the sun. 
 Oh, that's too bad. 
 I make do. 
 Where's Beth? 
 Uh, I think she's getting ready. 
 Oh... Going out to lunch? 
 Uh, thought we'd take a drive. 
 Oh, that's romantic. 
 Yeah. 
 Speaking of romantic, any big plans for your honeymoon? 
 Hawaii. 
 There's a lot of sun in Hawaii. 
 Yeah. Beth's like a fish; she loves the water. 
 I wanted to go skiing, but... 
 Larry, if you didn't want to go to Hawaii, you could have just said something. 
 Who doesn't love Hawaii? Haha! It's no big deal. 
 No, it's not. I-I-I just want Beth to be happy. 
 (cell phone ringing) Oh. 
 This is work, I have to take it. 
 You're allowed to be happy too, Larry. 
 (door opening) 
 (whispering): Fix this! 
 Pardon me? 
 (squeaking): Fix this! 
 So, your tea remedy didn't do the trick. 
 (Martha sighs.) 
 I can't make any promises, but if you go 72 hours without speaking, there's a chance you'll be able to make your speech. 
 (whispering): No talking? 
 Not a peep. 
 (whispering): Very well. I accept your challenge. 
 (squeaking): And I relish it! You have no idea of the extent of my willpower. 
 Gandhi himself was a veritable slacker by comparison. 
 Martha. 
 What? Yes? 
 Starting now. 
 Oh! 
 (whispering): Right. 
 (small laugh) 
 (little sigh) 
 So, how did it go last night with your basketball team? 
 Coach asked me to join. 
 Nick, that's great! 
 How did your driving lessons go? 
 Well, at the rate I'm going, by the time I get enough experience to pass my driving test, I'll be so old I'll be able to ride the bus for free. 
 I'm seriously just considering just cancelling my test. 
 Don't give up. Try your mom again. 
 She's cool. OK. She's only cool to you because she's not your mom. 
 I don't know. 
 When it comes time for me to get behind the wheel, I think I'd gladly switch out my dad for your mom.

 (Stephanie sighs.) 
 OK, you definitely showed those menus who's boss. 
 My investor pulled out. 
 He loved my business plan. 
 He seemed to love the rental space I found. 
 I have built-in customers and a marketing plan. 
 (sighing): It's a sure thing. 
 At least it was. I don't know what went wrong. 
 I just want to say it has been so great working for you. 
 You're quitting?! 
 I'm gonna start my own business. 
 (Stephanie gasping) 
 Have a great night. 
 ♪♪♪ 
 What are you reading? 
 Haha! A driver's ed manual. 
 Grace and I had a disagreement. 
 Over...? 
 Safe distances between other cars and bikes. 
 Ah... no. 
 Nick doesn't turn 15 for a few months yet. 
 Lucky you. 
 Ah, yeah. 
 Aha! 
 I'm right! I knew it! 
 I am not surprised. 
 Not that it matters. 
 My driving instruction days are over. 
 You don't know that for sure. 
 Oh no, she said, "Mom, I don't want you to teach me how to drive." 
 OK, you know for sure. 
 Should I set two extra places for breakfast tomorrow? 
 Ah, Linda. 
 Yeah. 
 I like having you guys around. 
 Well, I would enjoy it more under different circumstances. 
 Nick loves his mother. 
 And I want him to, but she's... 
 Well, I never thought she'd stick around. 
 She's obsessed with work. 
 She's found a way to do her work and be close to Nick. 
 You're too nice. 
 So are you. 
 (chuckling): Not when it comes to Linda. Still... she told me that she asked you to stay away from Nick and me. 
 She did. 
 Don't. 
 OK? 
 I... like having you in my life. 
 Cassie? Sorry to track you down. 
 Oh, what is it? 
 I've been thinking... we need to cancel the wedding. 
 I can't marry Beth. 
 ♪♪♪ 
 Cassie told me you'd be up here. 
 Are you OK? 
 You were such a cute baby. 
 I'm not pregnant. 
 I'm so sorry. 
 I love you. 
 I love you too. 
 Is there anything I can do? 
 You're doing it. 
 Wow! 
 I know. 
 I freaked out when I thought I was pregnant. 
 I freaked out too when you told me. 
 To be honest, I'm kind of relieved. 
 What? 
 Well, I mean... 
 You didn't really want to have the baby? 
 No. No, I didn't say that. 
 I think you did just say that. 
 No, I didn't. Tara, you just said you were freaked out too. 
 Well, I was! 
 I was scared to death. 
 But now that I know I'm not pregnant, I don't know, I feel this huge loss, and it's just overwhelming me. 
 Look. Maybe, not being pregnant is a sign that we're not ready. 
 What? Hold on. 
 I... I thought you said you wanted to have kids. 
 Why, I do. Someday. 
 (Tara sighs.) 
 Which is why you're so relieved that I'm not pregnant. 
 ♪♪♪ 
 So... this new business you're starting... 
 Look, you're wrong about me. 
 I'm a born saleswoman with plenty of experience. I've just decided to use my skills to better my life instead of yours. 
 And how exactly are you planning on funding this business? 
 Oh, I found an investor. 
 Dale? 
 Mm-hmm. 
 We had dinner while you were camping. 
 I knew it! You stole my investor! 
 I didn't steal anything; I just had a better business plan and sales pitch. Sorry. 
 You're not sorry. 
 No, you know what, I'm not. And thank you. 
 For what? 
 For not making me your partner.
