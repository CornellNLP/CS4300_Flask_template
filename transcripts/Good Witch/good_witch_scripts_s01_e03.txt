 Cassie :  Previously on  Good Witch. 
 I have big plans for this year and they all start and end on the success of the heritage festival. 
 Annie is back. 
 Oh. 
 What game? 
 The game you've been winning and I've been losing ever since the divorce. 
 Her real name's Heather. She's my granddaughter. 
 Where will you go? Leaving is a mistake. 
 I made a lot of those. 
 There you are. 
 I have a bone to pick with you. 
 Where's my starter's pistol? 
 Retired. Permanently. 
 I'm not leading a band. I want my gun. 
 I don't think anybody wants a repeat of last year. 
 I didn't know it was loaded. 
 With blanks, thankfully. 
 I scared myself way more than I scared that silly scouting troop. 
 Whistle. 
 Well, I suppose I'll just have to make do. 
 Have a nice night, Madam Mayor. 
 (Small whistle blow) 
 Oh! 
 (Louder whistle blow) 
 Refill? 
 No. If I have anymore I won't sleep all a week. 
 Thanks. 
 We need to talk. 
 Gary Zimmerman. 
 He's a federal prosecutor. 
 Mr. Beamish. 
 I really didn't want to bother anyone. 
 I think you're probably pretty bothered yourself. 
 That's why I'm leaving. 
 Before the race? 
 If I had known that Heather... 
 Ashley was in Middleton, I never would have come. 
 I don't want to upset her. I don't want to cause her any trouble. 
 She's gone. 
 Because of me? 
 No. 
 Unfortunately, she's got troubles of her own. 
 So Ashley isn't Ashley, she's Heather and she's on the run? 
 Her fiancé was laundering money. 
 And once she found out what he was up to, she agreed to testify against him but then got scared and came here. I'm pretty sure that her fiancé got to her. 
 Ashley? 
 Yeah. 
 What kind of trouble is she in? 
 Well, she's running from her past and there are some people after her. 
 But my step son is a police officer and he's out looking for her right now. 
 Before she was born, I cut her mother off. 
 Her mother was dating a man I didn't approve of. 
 She moved in with him, got pregnant. 
 I told her to come home, she refused to leave him. 
 I came here to fulfill a promise to my wife and look what I've opened up. 
 But maybe being here with Ashley gives you a chance to fulfill a different promise to your wife. 
 Hm... 
 I should go. Can I leave this with you? 
 In case she comes back. It's just money I want her to have. 
 I think you'll find someone in need to give it to on your journey home. 
 (Theme music) 
 woman : The race starts in 30 minutes! 
 More carbs? 
 The best thing about running is eating. 
 How about you? 
 Oh, I've given up running, remember? (Chuckles) 
 But I haven't given up dancing. 
 Ah... good to know. 
 So... are you going to the ball? 
 Hadn't given it much thought. You? 
 I'm catering it. The whole town's gonna be there. 
 Well, I'm told I should mingle more with my fellow citizens. 
 Mingling is good. 
 You know, I have to say, I lived in the same building in New York for fifteen years and I'd be hard-pressed to pick any of my neighbors out of a line up. 
 Not a lot of mingling in New York, huh? 
 Not on purpose, no. 
 So, does this mean I will see you, or...? 
 You just might. 
 Thanks. 
 You okay? 
 Yeah. Just psyching myself up. 
 Oh good! I thought you had asthma. 
 Beet juice? 
 Hey. 
 Is that a dare? 
 Beets are an excellent source of inorganic nitrates which supply blood flow to muscles, but, of course, you already knew that, didn't you? 
 I don't need beets, just skill and hard work. 
 I think everyone could use a little extra help. 
 I think you're right. 
 I love your beet juice, thank you Cassie. 
 And you are going down. 
 Hm! 
 Something I said? 
 No, someone he saw. 
 Who? 
 Annie. 
 Who's that? 
 His ex-fiancé. 
 Who's the guy with her? 
 Oh, uh, that would be mark, his ex-best friend, um, Annie's husband. 
 I put Ashley's description out on the wire, I've got the county sheriff looking as well and, obviously my men are keeping their eyes open. 
 I've got the marshal service helping too. 
 I hope we can find her before her fiancé does and I can get her to testify. 
 Putting her ex behind bars is the safest thing for her. 
 Yeah. 
 (Sigh) 
 Missed you at the race. Nick! 
 Dad, please. 
 What are you doing? 
 Trying to remember what video games are like. 
 I think you love that Xbox more than me. don't make me choose. 
 Come on... 
 What do you want me to do for entertainment? 
 Come to the ball with me? 
 Ball? 
 The whole town will be there. 
 I don't dance. 
 Well, just come and hang out. 
 If I go, will you give me my stuff back? 
 No. 
 Then have a good time. 
 Hi. 
 Hey. 
 I just feel like being alone, thanks. 
 Ok. 
 I'm sorry about the race. 
 I think we both know that's not what this is about. 
 I take it you didn't know they were coming? 
 Ah, no! 
 And you know what I can't stand? That she still gets to me and he still gets to me. (Sigh) 
 It takes a lot of energy to stay angry. 
 That's interesting. Doesn't change how I feel. 
 I know that you can always forgive people, but for me there's a limit. 
 Maybe it's time to change tactics. 
 Yeah. 
 Ok. 
 What are you suggesting? 
 Forgive. 
 You're kidding me? 
 No, no way! 
 I'm sorry Cassie, but you're wrong about this one. 
 I hear congratulations are in order. 
 I won. 
 Ryan came in second. 
 He didn't have his mind on the race. 
 His fiancé took off with his best friend. 
 Wow, that's rough. 
 But anger isn't healthy. 
 Yes it is. 
 No, it's not. 
 Sometimes it's all that gets you out of bed in the morning. 
 But you wouldn't understand. 
 Excuse me? 
 You're one of those, um... 
 "Turn the other cheek" people, I can tell. 
 Well, forgiveness isn't about the person who hurt you, it's about you and moving on. Hate traps you in the past. 
 Yeah, well, you've never been... 
 Never been what? 
 Cheated on. 
 Ah, but you have. 
 Well, it wasn't my best friend or anything. My wife's pilates instructor. 
 I should have known. She was always going to the gym but she was in horrible shape. 
 And you never forgave her? 
 No. I divorced her. 
 Well, I have some work to do... 
 At the clinic. Um... 
 See you tonight? 
 Yeah. 
 Hey. 
 Hi! 
 Amber! 
 You wanna hang out? 
 With me? 
 Yeah, silly. 
 Who else? 
 Great. Just have a coffee. I'll be right with you. Ok. 
 Hello. 
 Hi. Can I help you? 
 Well, actually, I was just driving by on my way out of town and remembered this place. 
 This is for your shelter. 
 I don't understand. 
 I'm making a donation. 
 Somebody suggested I might find someone in need to give it to. 
 Well, this is incredibly generous of you. 
 This'll help a lot of women in trouble, thank you. 
 Ok. 
 Uh, don't... 
 It's ok. 
 Who are you? 
 I'm someone who wants to help you. 
 Morning. 
 Ryan! 
 Where are you going? 
 Well, to be frank, away from you two. 
 You're never gonna forgive me. 
 That's not true. 
 I will never forgive either one of you. 
 Come on, isn't there a statute of limitations on this mess between us? 
 Yeah! 
 Now that you're dating Cassie, don't you want to just move beyond all this? 
 I, uh... 
 I kind of thought you two would end up together. 
 You are together, right? 
 Or do we have it all wrong? 
 Hey Cassie. 
 Hey Ryan. What's up? 
 Will you go to the ball with me? 
 I don't understand. 
 I'm asking you to be my date. 
 I still don't understand. 
 Seriously? 
 Un-huh. 
 Ok, you need to be my date because Annie and mark already think that you are because they think we are together. Like couple together. 
 Why would they think that? 
 Because I told her. 
 Um... 
 It's not totally a lie. 
 We are together, we're just not together-together. 
 Ok, so I lied. 
 But I know her, she's just here to check up on us. 
 We're not an "us". 
 She thinks we are ever since she saw us together at that real estate thingy last week. 
 Ok. 
 Ok, ok, never mind, alright? 
 Just forget this conversation. 
 I plead temporary insanity and I will go and tell Annie the truth. 
 Ok. 
 I don't know What I was thinking. I'm sorry. 
 (Chuckles) 
 Wait. 
 I do know what I was thinking. 
 See, Annie is only here to find out if you and I are together and she is hoping that we are not because she likes that she's happily married and I'm still single. 
 In some sick kind of way, it makes her feel superior to me. 
 And that is one among many reasons that I will never forgive her. Or them. 
 What? 
 Ryan tells me congratulations are in order. 
 I guess they are. 
 You're together? 
 Together. Yes. 
 Yeah. 
 Hey Sam. Come on in. 
 I saw you walk up. 
 Oh. 
 So, uh... 
 What can I do for you? 
 (Sighing) Nothing. 
 And yet here you stand. 
 I just don't want you to get the wrong idea about me. 
 Wrong idea? 
 Earlier. 
 Yes. 
 I was just saying that I... I understand how Ryan feels. 
 Ok. don't do that. 
 Do what? 
 Sound like you agree with me when you really don't. 
 Sam... 
 Some things can't be forgiven. 
 I believe in forgiveness, you don't. 
 I believe in forgiveness, it's just some things are unforgivable. 
 Forgiveness is like love if it isn't unconditional, it doesn't work. 
 I wouldn't expect you to understand. 
 From what I can gather you had a pretty idyllic marriage. 
 Yeah, that was ended by the person who killed Jake. 
 And you don't hate him? 
 I did. 
 I'm human. 
 But if I continued to hate, it would have consumed me and that's not a way to live. 
 Hi, Cassie. 
 I was so worried about you. 
 I know. 
 Well, this is boring. 
 I have two papers and a lab due. 
 This is what it's like to hang with me. 
 Well, can we at least talk about boys? 
 Which boy? 
 Hi. Ask Amber to the dance. 
 Do this and we're even. 
 Since when are you friends with Amber? 
 Believe me, I'm not. 
 But she's trying to be friends with me. 
 Yeah, she's at my house hoping to "accidentally" run into you at your house. 
 I don't like to dance. I already told her that. 
 Uh, news flash: She doesn't care. 
 And who doesn't like to dance? 
 Me. 
 You're not any good at it, are you? 
 And you don't do anything that you're not good at, right? 
 Bye Grace. Have a fun time with Amber. 
 Nick, please! 
 Ok, I'll teach you. 
 If I do, this clears the slate between us? 
 Yes. 
 Absolutely. 
 <i> You're going to the dance with Cassie?</i> 
 Yes. She's helping me save face with mark and Annie. She's a good friend. 
 What? 
 Just for you, I think there's a little truth in this big lie. 
 Where'd you find her? 
 We didn't. 
 Mr. Beamish did. 
 She was in a shelter on the other side of town. 
 What's the deal with those two? 
 Well, if Beamish didn't tell you, it's not my news to share. 
 Will she testify? 
 She didn't say but I can tell she's really scared. 
 I know everyone's going to the ball tonight, but I think I'll stay here and keep an eye on her. 
 Won't really be any fun without Tara anyway. 
 I know you miss her. 
 I do. 
 You have to get off the couch. 
 I can't do this. 
 Nick, come on. It's not dismantling a nuclear warhead, it's a slow dance. 
 Only... it's not, is it? 
 Nick, what happened to you? 
 I don't want to talk about it. 
 You know what? 
 Let's just forget about all of this. 
 I was hit, ok? 
 You were dancing and you got hit? 
 By what? 
 Emily. 
 You got hit by a girl? 
 Wow! 
 I was eight, ok? 
 It was my first dance and... I said no and she hit me. 
 I was tortured at school for like a year. 
 Seems like you're still kind of torturing yourself. 
 And that dancing thing is just a mental block, you need to get past it. 
 Why? 
 Um, so you can take Amber to the dance and she'll go back to bothering you and stop bothering me. 
 And hey... 
 I promise that no one will know that for a very short time you doubted your coolness. 
 ♪♪♪ 
 Wow. 
 What? 
 You are bad. 
 Grace? 
 Your mom said you were over here. 
 It's ruined! The ball is ruined! 
 What happened? 
 They have a gas leak at the country club and they have to shut the place down. 
 Ok, don't panic. 
 I'm jinxed, Cassie. 
 Jinxed! Do you have something to, you know, de-jinx me? 
 I don't believe in jinxes, Martha. 
 Well, then what do you suggest I do? 
 Move the ball. 
 (Laughing) Move the ball! 
 Oh my. 
 But... but-but but the leak! How did you...? 
 I had a wedding scheduled for the weekend and today I just had a feeling to start prepping Grey House early. 
 A feeling? 
 A feeling. 
 And the wedding? 
 The father of the bride had to have emergency surgery so they have to postpone. 
 Fabulous! 
 Well, you know, not about the father or the wedding but... 
 For us. The ball will go on! 
 Oh Cassie, thank you. 
 Ten minutes before the guests start arriving. 
 
 
 
 Hey, Ryan. Hey Steph. 
 You're early. 
 Yeah, well, I was hoping I could talk to you. 
 What do you want? 
 Look, I know it's a little late... 
 Ok, it's a lot late, but, uh... 
 I wanted to say I'm sorry. 
 What do you expect me to say? 
 Nothing. I just... 
 I wanted to say what I should have said years ago. 
 And uh... 
 Now I've said it, so... thanks for that. 
 And you and Cassie make a great couple. 
 It's nice to see you so happy. 
 Right, well... don't you hate it when horrible people do not-so horrible things? 
 You look so beautiful, mom. 
 Aw, but you are the real beauty. 
 But... 
 You don't want to look beautiful, do you? 
 What? 
 Well, if you look beautiful, then you'll attract people, then maybe you'll feel attracted to them. 
 It's not cheating on daddy. 
 I know. 
 He wants you to be happy. 
 Yeah, I know, but um... 
 Mom... 
 It's time. 
 Thanks. 
 Hi. Thanks for letting me come back. 
 You're welcome here anytime. 
 So you... you know the truth about me? 
 Brandon told me. 
 I don't know if I can testify, Cassie. 
 Tonight, you're safe. 
 And uh... 
 It could be good for you to try and have some fun. 
 Have you seen Nick? 
 He's coming. 
 Are you sure? 
 Yeah. 
 He better be. 
 This is not a pub. 
 Shoulders back, tray shoulder height, up, up, up! 
 Go. Now. 
 But I I wasn't finished with him. 
 You have to stand down. 
 Excuse me? 
 You need to back off the staff, or I'm going to have a mutiny on my hands. 
 But they are not carrying the trays properly. 
 If you don't leave them alone, Madam Mayor, they are going to improperly carry their trays to their cars and drive away. 
 Oh. 
 Looks like you were right about me finding a place for that money. 
 You found Ashley. 
 I did. 
 And if you hadn't... 
 Does she know who you really are? 
 She has so many problems and she's scared. 
 Maybe she just needs a little lesson in bravery. 
 Wow! Ryan is going to be knocked on his... well you know. 
 Ah, I didn't dress for Ryan. 
 Well, he dressed for you. 
 What do you mean? 
 It is amazing that you see so many things for other people, but yet are totally blind to the fact that Ryan likes you... 
 And not just as a friend. 
 Wow! You look marvelous. 
 Thanks. 
 Um, these are for you. Thank you. 
 Sweet! 
 Yeah... sweet. 
 (Chuckles) 
 Ok, what gives? 
 What? don't "what" me. 
 What's going on with you and Nick? 
 All you need to know is that Amber was driving me crazy and... 
 Now she's with Nick. 
 Why won't you tell me what's really going on? 
 I can't. 
 Since when don't you tell me? 
 I promised. 
 Well, whatever he told you must be pretty bad. 
 Anthony... 
 Ok, fine. 
 Cassie, hi! 
 Oh, hello. 
 Where's your man? Ryan? 
 He's on a call. Business. 
 You two got together kind of all of a sudden, huh? 
 We did. 
 I still have a lot of friends in town. 
 Yes. 
 My parents still live here. 
 Right. 
 And no one has said anything about you and Ryan dating, that's funny huh? 
 Yeah, yeah, we've been, you know, keeping it kind of quiet. 
 Yep. 
 Okay, look, I know Ryan, we almost got married, and he's good at a lot of things, but lying is not one of them. 
 You two aren't really dating, are you? 
 I know I'm right, I do! And, and... 
 I know why Ryan would lie, but what I don't get is why you would go along with it. 
 I just have to ask, why do you care so much who Ryan does or doesn't date? 
 I... don't care. 
 No, you do. 
 And I think you need to ask yourself why. 
 I have my own idea, but I'll let you figure that one out for yourself. 
 What's in the punch? 
 Wouldn't you like to know. 
 Yes, one punch, pl... Make it two, please. 
 Well, you look stunning. 
 You clean up nicely yourself. 
 Thanks. I didn't think I'd be wearing this suit so soon, but uh, Middleton is more of a casual place. And I like that. 
 But we still like to put on our party clothes. 
 Clearly. You should do it more often. 
 Hey, I'm sorry about... 
 Earlier. That conversation... 
 It's ok to be hurt, Sam. 
 She cheated on me. 
 I don't want to talk about it, really, it's just that... I only want to apologize. 
 For being right again? 
 Bottom line is, people don't change. 
 But sometimes they do surprise you. 
 Hey, Nick! You came! 
 Uh, yeah, I did. 
 Nick... 
 Uh, see ya, dad. 
 Ok! 
 Excuse us. 
 Oh! 
 You're an "us"... now? 
 Did you make a decision about whether you're going to testify? 
 No. 
 Why did you show up at the shelter? 
 And... 
 How do you know my real name? 
 Who are you? 
 And why do you care so much about what happens to me? 
 I really do want to tell you. 
 So tell me. 
 To be honest, I'm a little scared at how you'll react when I tell you the truth. So... 
 I'm gonna take a deep breath and I'll tell you the truth. 
 About me? 
 About us. 
 "Us". 
 I'm your grandfather. 
 Hi. I'm mark. 
 Hey! 
 Sam. 
 Do you live in Middleton? 
 Not anymore. 
 I'm from New York. Just moved here. 
 Eesh! Sorry to hear that. 
 I like it. Do you come to the festival every year? 
 (Laughing) Not if I can help it. 
 So what brings you this year? 
 I have little business here. 
 Business? 
 I'm in real estate. 
 So is Ryan. 
 Yeah, I know. 
 So are you here to see Ryan? 
 I'm here to see a client of his that, uh... 
 Might be looking to become a client of mine. 
 Thanks for bringing me a drink. 
 It doesn't seem right, you being stuck in here all night. 
 Ah, well, I'll get out, eventually. 
 Are you saving me a dance? 
 I was considering it. 
 Well, consider your dance card filled as soon as I get out of this kitchen. 
 Hey, can I ask you a question? 
 Mm-hm. 
 What's the deal with mark? 
 Ryan's ex-besty. 
 Yeah. 
 How long do you have? 
 (Chuckles) 
 What're you so happy about? 
 I promised Grace I wouldn't say. 
 Excuse me. 
 Thank you for this. 
 You don't need me. 
 Oh, I do. 
 Hm. You only think you do. 
 So, changing the subject... 
 Mark apologized. 
 Really? 
 Yeah. I think he wants to be friends or something. 
 And you? 
 I never thought I'd have this dilemma. 
 I thought hell would freeze over before he'd ever own up to what he did to me. 
 And? 
 I don't know, Cassie, I don't know if I'm ready to... 
 Try all this forgiveness stuff you're talking about. 
 But you'll know when. 
 I'm gonna testify. 
 I called Zimmerman. I wanted you to know. 
 What made you change your mind? 
 My grandfather. 
 I have a grandfather. 
 Yeah? 
 Yeah! 
 I ran to Middleton to get away from my life and I actually found a life I didn't know I had. 
 I found my past and I guess... 
 The strength to do the right thing. 
 And the only way any of that is gonna happen is if I testify and put my fiancé in jail. 
 So... you're leaving? 
 But maybe I'll be back someday. 
 I'd like that. 
 Thank you. 
 Hey! 
 Hi, there. 
 I need to tell you something. 
 Shoot. 
 You know your friend, mark? 
 Mark's not my friend. 
 That's an accurate statement. 
 So I'm gonna to go back and help her while she testifies. 
 And... we're gonna take it from there. 
 Thank you. 
 Oh, I didn't do anything, you did. 
 And I think you kept your promise to your wife. 
 Yeah. 
 I think I did. 
 Hey. 
 What'd you say to Anthony? 
 What? 
 Anthony! You told him didn't you! 
 No. No, I didn't. 
 You're lying. 
 I... Nick! 
 Man, you and Annie deserve one another. 
 Excuse me? 
 No, I don't think I will, not this time. Neither of you is here for the dance, right? 
 Alright. What are we here for? 
 Well, Annie's here to make sure that I'm still alone and you are here to steal some of my business. 
 I don't know what you're talking about. 
 You've been lying so long I don't think you'd know how to tell the truth if your life depended on it. 
 Well, you know what, I guess we're never going to be friends again. 
 We were never friends in the first place. 
 That was my mistake. Yours was coming back here, thinking you could screw me over again. 
 Wait a minute... 
 I'm done with you and I'm done with Annie. 
 Fine. 
 And Jones, the real estate developer that you thought that you could steal from me... He's done with you too. 
 Yeah. See, 'cause I got a little tip from Sam. 
 So I called him. Jones knew you were full of it from the first time that he spoke to you. 
 You're losing your game, buddy. 
 You're never gonna get over the fact that I stole Annie from you. 
 You're wrong. 
 I am over it. 
 Right. 
 Finally and for good, I am over it. Which is why I can tell you this: I forgive you. 
 I don't understand. 
 It's not about you, it's about me. 
 Just go. 
 Why would I go? 
 Because you've been caught and you can't lie your way out of this one. 
 And because Middleton is my town. It's my home. 
 And I think you're not welcome here anymore. 
 I should have known I'd never get out of this kitchen. 
 You don't need to. 
 To what? 
 Get out of the kitchen. 
 Impressive. 
 Oh, I've got moves. 
 Hey! 
 I just want to make something clear. 
 Ok? 
 I don't care about Ryan. 
 I think you do. 
 Hey, ladies. 
 What's going on? 
 Just give it up, Ryan. 
 Give what up? 
 You and Cassie are not together. I know you're lying. Just admit it. 
 Just let it go. 
 No. I know I'm right. Just admit it. 
 No, Annie, you're wrong! 
 Together enough for you? 
 What happened? He thinks I did something. What does he think I did? Anthony? 
 I may have let him believe that you told me what you wouldn't tell me. 
 Hi, Anthony. 
 You ok? 
 Yeah. I have to go, ok? I'll see you later. 
 Ok. 
 Everything ok? 
 Yeah. 
 Thanks for that, um... the kiss. 
 It shut her up! 
 That it did, yes. 
 I think I get the whole forgiveness thing now. 
 It's pretty powerful stuff, huh? 
 Yeah, I feel like a new man. 
 I guess I was just... 
 Blinded by what I thought was love and I spent a lot of time telling everyone who cared for me that they didn't understand, they didn't get Annie. 
 But I didn't get it, not them. And then I got it. 
 (Laughing) 
 So... 
 Again, thank you. 
 For? 
 For coming with me, for kissing me in front of the whole town. You are a good friend. 
 Look... 
 I just wanted you to know that I didn't tell Anthony anything. 
 I don't believe you. 
 (Sighing) Hey. 
 It seems I won a race, but lost an argument. 
 Yeah? 
 People can change. 
 Especially my son. 
 Just have to give'em a chance. 
 Wow... 
 What? 
 So this is what it feels like to be wrong. 
 You better get used to it. 
 Well, living next door to you, I think I better. 
 Well, that was a heritage ball to remember. 
 I can honestly say that I can't wait for next year. 
 One more for the road? 
 You know something? 
 I think we make an amazing fake couple. 
 I agree. 
 (Chuckles) 
 Maybe... 
 Maybe we should try it for real. 
 They make a nice couple don't they ?
