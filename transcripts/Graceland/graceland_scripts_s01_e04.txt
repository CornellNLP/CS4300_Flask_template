 Previously on  Graceland... 
 You can never walk up to a woman and say, "Hi, I'm special agent Mike Warren." 
 I'm Abby. Nice to meet you, Mike. 
 Put me on Bello. 
 Hell no. 
 He's a major player in Long Beach. 
 He's into drugs and guns. 
 Jakes just scored a thousand armor-piercing bullets. 
 You tell Bello that you've got a guy at camp Pendleton with the bullets, a marine. 
 That'd be you. 
 I got the look, right? 
 You know what a heat run is? 
 A heat run is when someone makes a series of random turns and speed changes in order to avoid a tail. 
 Our boy Eddie, he just bought $1/2 million in illegal ammo. 
 He always makes the same exact heat run. 
 You know where he's going. 
 There they are. [Tires squeal] 
 Eddie, how did anyone know where you would be? 
 I would never betray you. 
 Light the stove. 
 Can I buy an ounce? 
 It's gonna be $200. 
 II heard it was good, though. 
 Top of the line. 
 That's cheap, but okay. 
 [Suspenseful music] 
 ♪ 
 [Police sirens] 
 It was the end of an age of virtue, and the authorities shuddered as immorality and hedonism intensified. 
 Finally, Pope Sixtus V declared an end to protestantism. 
 Visitors swept through Italia like a flash flood. 
 Their cruelty was boundless, and as time passed transgressors realized there would be no reprieve. 
 Watch the car. 
 My great-grandmother's great-grandmother's great-grandma ran the kitchen at the cathedral Di Napoli. 
 Her name was Francesca. 
 That math doesn't add up. 
 This isn't a story about math... listen. 
 As Francesca prepared her famous ragu for the inquisitors, she heard a knock at the cathedral door. 
 [Knocks] 
 Niccolo, a handsome cordwainer, begging for sanctuary from the inquisition. 
 What's a cordwainer again? 
 A luxury shoemaker. Don't interrupt. 
 You'll throw off the magic. 
 I'm sorry. 
 Anyway, knowing this kid faced torture or death, Francesca hid Niccolo in the pantry. 
 She promised to keep her ragu warm until the local vicar declared the city cleansed. 
 Last time you said it was an archdeacon, remember? 
 Now it's a vicar. Shut up, Johnny. 
 Yep. 
 After three long days, the inquisitors finally left Napoli. 
 Niccolo survived on the promise and smell of the ragu. 
 They fell in love and vowed to pass on the sauce to their children and their children's children till the end of days. 
 Yeah. 
 [Applause] 
 Every time. 
 This is Francesca's ragu. 
 It takes three days to prepare, and the rules are simple. 
 Don't touch and don't be late. 
 There will be no leftovers. 
 The best bedtime story ever. 
 Calling it an early one? 
 Range at 0600. 
 Blasting the old seven ring. 
 You need some help? 
 That depends, do you have ancestors from medieval naples? 
 No. 
 Okay, then don't touch my braciole. 
 This the score? 
 Eh, it's crazy these mopes who do a street deal when you can get the pot legally. 
 Yeah, there's still a market for it with teenagers, illegal immigrants, people that are too embarrassed to ask their doctor. 
 It's dense. 
 Thick wiry hairs, purple highlights. 
 Guessing master Kush and India Kush hybrid. 
 I'm sorry. What does that mean? 
 That means there's no way it should be selling as cheap as $200 an ounce. 
 Yo, Chuckie. 
 Yo. 
 You gonna be manning that sauce all weekend? 
 Yeah, I jacked up my back shutting down the grape street cook. 
 Figured I'd take a few sick days, a few more Vicodin. 
 I hear you, man. 
 [Phone beeps] 
 What have you got there, smiley? 
 Nothing. 
 Nothing? 
 Nothing's making you grin pretty wide. 
 It's an inside joke. 
 Men don't grin at their text messages. 
 It's from Abby. 
 "Don't forget about Maryland"? 
 Who's Abby? 
 It's the girl from the drop. 
 Oh. 
 What's in Maryland, Mikey? 
 Softshell crabs. Give it back. 
 Huh? 
 Come on. 
 No, no, no. 
 Oh, is your new girlfriend trying to steal you back to the eastern seaboard? 
 She's not my girlfriend. 
 She's not? 
 We hung out once. 
 And I know we don't date here. 
 Give him back his phone, Johnny. 
 Who said we don't date? 
 Um, everyone. 
 We can date. We just can't get too close. 
 No one expects you to survive on the company of these degenerates. 
 Smelling good down here, Chuck. 
 You missed the story, honey. 
 Yeah, I know the story, honey. 
 Now it was a vicar this time. 
 A vicar, huh? 
 Yeah. 
 Hey, Mike. 
 Hmm? 
 I need to see you in the phone room. 
 Eddie called. 
 Listen. 
 I've been trying to reach you. 
 Well, now you got me. 
 The boss wants a sit-down. 
 You're in. 
 Send an address. I'll be there. 
 Bring your marine friend. The boss would like him too. 
 I hope your camo's clean. 
 Could be another setup. 
 Yeah, it could. 
 Smile, Mike. 
 We just got a sit-down with Southern California's primary heroin supplier. 
 The agency won't approve DNA testing to match the buds. 
 For all the money they're throwing at the war on drugs... 
 It looks the same to me. 
 Yeah, Dale, come here real quick. 
 What's up? 
 See this? 
 This is from silver barn collective up in San Luis Obispo. 
 You can get it at almost any dispensary in the county. 
 And this I pulled off an El Segundo high sophomore last night. It's the same strain. 
 A lot of weed farms grow more than they're legally allowed. 
 End up putting the extra on the street. 
 Yeah, that's what we're thinking. 
 I would drive up there and shut 'em down, but the D.E.A. won't approve farm raids unless it's a sure thing. 
 Politicians. Need my help? 
 You worked that Canadian pipeline a few years back, right? 
 Four months up and down the coast in an 18-Wheeler. 
 Then the state decriminalizes weed, and the dealers I'm working aren't criminals anymore. 
 Well, it looks like they're criminals again. 
 The owner of silver barn is Ashika Pearl. 
 You gotta be kidding me. 
 What? 
 This broad drove me crazy. 
 Oh, Jakesy had a crush. 
 No, no, no, no. 
 I had to fight her off with a stick. 
 Really? 
 Yeah. 
 It's bad form to sleep with perps. 
 I will try not to put you in that position, but if I pose as a dealer, can you set me up a meet? 
 No, my cover with her had Latin gang contacts. 
 You don't exactly pass as Mexican mafia. 
 Well, if it's not Paige, then... 
 Johnny! 
 Yo. What? 
 You're Mexican, right? 
 What? 
 Hey, Mike, why don't you lose the shoulder harness, okay? 
 I know the tac team's gonna be close, but I'm not going in there unarmed. 
 Easy, buddy, I didn't say you were. 
 Wear it visible though. 
 We're not the only ones that remember our last meeting. 
 Oh, you think Bello's gonna respect a little self-preservation, huh? 
 Yeah, or he'll shoot you on sight. 
 Who knows? 
 Sure you don't want a red rose? 
 [Chuckles] No, man. 
 All black is more legit. 
 You want legit, you should let me bic your head. 
 [Laughs] You ain't touching my head, girl. 
 My hair ain't much, but it's the featured attraction, you know? 
 Mm. That's something for the ladies to look forward to. 
 [Chuckles] I hate you, jerk. 
 What's your back story, JT? 
 Grew up in the LBC. 
 I joined Eastside Longos when my best friend got gunned down by some Cambodians in a drive-by. 
 Longos are high-profile. 
 You sure you wanna bite that off? 
 Sh, that's my brother's real life. 
 I won't mess it up. 
 Yo, customs in the house. 
 Meet's in 30. How we looking? 
 Almost done. 
 No, no, no, no. 
 We still gotta do below the belt. 
 One, they don't make airbrushes that small. 
 And, two, nobody's looking below your belt, Johnny. 
 What if she, like, wants to go skinny-dipping? 
 In what alternate Mexican universe do drug dealers suggest skinny-dipping? 
 People are into weird sh1t. 
 I don't think you wanna go swimming with these, baby. 
 What about, like, naked twister? 
 I'm not having this conversation. 
 Come on, Jakes! 
 Get him inked and get downstairs. Jakes? 
 Jakes, I love you, man. 
 You're stupid. 
 Yo. 
 What? 
 We should do a chupacabra on my left butt cheek. 
 Right? Shut up. 
 You know what those are, right? 
 Lay flat. 
 [Chuckles] 
 Christ, man. 
 Did a number on you, huh? 
 Stay here. 
 Jesus. Look at his eye. 
 Yeah, it's ugly, but it's good for us. 
 Good for us how? 
 Well, Bello's burning his own lieutenants. 
 It means he's convinced we didn't sell him out to Bobby moi. 
 Come on. 
 Future reference, man, I like this place much better than your warehouse. 
 [Chuckles] 
 You and me both. 
 Frisk them. 
 I'll save you 30 seconds and a broken hand. 
 Ah. 
 Is that a problem? 
 No. 
 Given the introduction, I understand the wariness. 
 Cool. 
 So what's good here? 
 Don't sit. 
 Today I want to speak to your friend. 
 Is that a problem? 
 Not at all. 
 You're on your own. 
 [Pats back] 
 [Clears throat] 
 [Exhales] 
 So you are a marine. 
 When I was 18, I joined the Nigerian army. 
 A year later, the President Abacha was dead. 
 I was rewarded for my service with exile. 
 Sounds like you picked the wrong side. 
 Ah, I am the one sipping the champagne now. 
 [Both chuckle] 
 So what are we doing here? 
 Business. 
 Have you ever seen a pit bull in his first fight? 
 I had bulldogs growing up. 
 Ah, well, then I'll tell you, it's not a pretty thing. 
 They have the teeth. 
 They have the muscularity. 
 But they have not quite yet learned how to fight. 
 My recruits are quite savage, but they lack the practical skill. 
 You want me to teach them to shoot? 
 They should at least have their WQBs. 
 Their what? What's WQB? 
 Would you like me to put a bullet in your stomach? 
 This is a public place. 
 See, let me worry about that. 
 How is it as a marine who served, you don't know what a WQB is? 
 You mean a pizza box? 
 It's the lowest level of marksmanship. 
 I haven't heard anyone say "WQB" since first week of boot. 
 Uhhuh. 
 They call it a pizza box? 
 It's a square. 
 The name's asinine, but that's what people call it. 
 My boys should have their pizza boxes. 
 It pays quite well. 
 If I'm in, should I expect to have a gun pointed at me every time we meet? 
 [Chuckles] 
 I pray that this is the last time. 
 [Both laugh] 
 I'm in. 
 Good. 
 Edward will get you the details. 
 [Footsteps approaching] 
 Hey, Paulie. 
 What's the word? 
 Gettin' a drink. 
 Rum's usually your morning drink. 
 Yeah, well, you know, the dog bites at all hours. 
 What's up? 
 You wanna talk or what? 
 No. Would you like a drink? 
 I'm good. Where's Mike? 
 Mike is making a deal with Bello. 
 Your Bello? 
 Mm-hmm. 
 First real meet-and-greet with a guy I've been chasing for three months... and the kid snakes it from you. 
 Well, I mean, he didn't really snake it from me. 
 Bello just wants him to play drill sergeant with his greenhorns. Oh, good for Mike. 
 The kid wasn't supposed to have to carry it on his own. 
 Oh, my God. 
 Honey, if you're so worried about him, why aren't you sitting at command? 
 There's a team on him. 
 You know what your problem is? 
 What is my problem, Charlie? 
 You got quarterback syndrome. 
 You don't think any of us can win unless you're leading the charge. 
 Well, I mean, Tom Brady has quarterback syndrome. 
 And he also has three championship rings. 
 Yeah, and Eli's got two and he's four years younger. 
 You pats fans make me sick. 
 Uh, you were making a point I think? 
 Yeah, okay. Mike's closer to Bello than anyone's ever been, right? 
 Yeah. 
 Okay. 
 So what are you more interested in, the yards or the ring? 
 Come on. 
 [Sighs] 
 Yo, slow down, bro. 
 We're already late, man. 
 So what? 
 So what is this ain't a costume party, Johnny. 
 It's a drug buy. [Scoffs] 
 It's a weed buy. So it's basically legal, right? 
 Yeah, well, until it's literally legal, we do our job. All right, Lancelot. 
 You sound like Mike now, bro. Hey, man. 
 Before I met her, Ashika Pearl lit a crop on fire up in humboldt. 
 She watched six rival growers burn to death. 
 So please excuse me if I take this seriously. 
 All right, okay, okay, okay, okay. 
 Yo, "Ashika"? What is that? 
 Indian. 
 Indian like rain dance or belly dance? 
 Belly dance. 
 But she's white though, right? 
 Yeah. She found Buddha, decided to change her name. 
 Yo, that's a nation of islam thing, changing your name. She's crazy, all right? 
 I don't know what else to say. Is she hot though? 
 Tell me the truth. Yeah, I guess. 
 Yo, Johnny, can we just do this fast? 
 Set a deal, agree to terms, and make the bust. 
 I don't wanna be here longer than I have to. 
 You got it, bro. Yes, sir. 
 Dude, don't do that sh1t. 
 You're late. 
 I know. 
 I'm sorry. I couldn't find my key... 
 Dale Jacobs, ahh. 
 You beautiful son of a bitch. 
 All right. 
 Mm. 
 Mwah. 
 Okay. 
 Try to be a little more European, will ya? 
 All right. 
 Anyway, it's good to see you. 
 Yeah. It's good to see you. 
 So this is the guy I was telling you about. 
 Ashika, JT. 
 JT, huh? 
 What's your story? 
 What does it matter what my story is? 
 Just chill, man, okay? She's... 
 I ain't got no story, B. 
 Dale says you could hook me up, here I am. 
 Is that what he said? 
 Yeah, I, um... 
 I heard you were back in business. 
 On the right side of things. 
 [Scoffs] Other side where the money's at. 
 Sweetheart, I don't need vocational advice from some low-level banger selling ditch weed out of his El Camino. 
 Oh, yeah? 
 I don't need no lip from some uppity '60s throwback yoga mat gringa who doesn't know when to shut... 
 Hey! Yo, chill, all right? 
 She show me some respect, I'll chill. 
 I don't need this sh1t., man. 
 You used to keep better company. 
 I swear, I did not know he was gonna act up like that. 
 You know, you were always a good one. 
 And I trust you, but I don't know about your amigo over there. 
 No, I get it. Just, uh, you know, give him another shot, all right? 
 He'll behave, my word. 
 All right. Come out to the farm tomorrow, and maybe I'll help you out. 
 Okay. 
 Maybe. 
 It was good to see you. 
 What the hell was that? 
 What was what? 
 "What was what"? 
 You almost blew my case. I didn't blow nothing. 
 I just I could help you guys out by... no, you don't have to think. 
 You are enlisted to facilitate a D.E.A. investigation... 
 Come on now. 
 Nothing more. 
 When reports got FBI up in the header, then you can front like a street thug. 
 Hold up, hold up. You guys see this, right? 
 I can't be longo and get punked by some hippie chick. 
 You're a federal agent with a henna tattoo. 
 Okay, okay, look. 
 What's done is done. 
 We'll go to the farm tomorrow. 
 We'll get eyes on the overgrowth, okay? 
 Yeah, all right. 
 Sorry, baby. 
 Don't even. Don't even. 
 [Chuckles] 
 Hey, hey. [Knocks] 
 Yo. 
 The Bello files? 
 Yeah, I'm just kinda going through it all again. 
 Hey, you did a lot of work on this. 
 I'll tell you what though. 
 You man a case for five or six years, you end up keeping whole paper mills in business. 
 Yeah. Listen. I've been racking my brain. 
 We gotta get you back under. No, no. 
 No, this is where you step up, Mike. 
 I've been asked to train a criminal organization to shoot with military proficiency. 
 Five minutes later, I get a call from ASAC saying that I need to pretend to train them... pretend. 
 This guy is burning out people's eyeballs. 
 Mm. You wanna keep your eyeballs? 
 Uh, yeah. 
 [Chuckles] 
 Okay. 
 Yeah, I'll call the bureau. 
 I'll explain that we're in a position of control here. 
 We can't really pretend, but we can pump the brakes a bit. 
 How about that? 
 Thank you. 
 All right. 
 Okay. Hey, guys, listen up. 
 Warren is out there with a lot of heat. 
 Let's stay alert. 
 Are these weapons satisfactory? 
 I asked Eddie for matching HKs. 
 When requesting weapons with no serial numbers, one cannot be so selective. 
 Americans? 
 And you're expecting Nigerians? 
 The city of Los Angeles was not easy to tame. 
 You have your blacks in South Central, your latins in East L.A., and none of them wanted me here. 
 You pushed into their territory. 
 I pushed, and I won. 
 I made it clear that this was only going to end one of two ways. 
 Join you or die, like Alexander The Great. 
 Surrender to the glory of Athens! 
 Hey, I like that. 
 Bello, the targets are up. 
 We are ready. Excellent. 
 Yeah, you can go ahead and take those down, Eddie. 
 What are you talking about? 
 We won't be shooting today. 
 Okay, okay. This is the hard sell. 
 Ready to go on my word. 
 Why won't we be shooting today, Michael? 
 Eddie, may I see your gun? 
 Before we learn to fire our weapons, we must first understand our weapons. 
 Today we field strip our firearm. 
 Disassembly, cleaning, and reassembly. 
 What is this? Is this really what you are paying him for? 
 A gun jams... Draws to the side... 
 Ammo sticks. 
 If it misfires, blows off your hand. 
 Any of that happens, you're tits up. 
 Yes, Edward. 
 This is precisely what I am paying him for. 
 Good work, Mike. 
 Follow his instructions. 
 I want to hear nothing but positive reports. 
 Stay. 
 Perhaps you will learn something. 
 Okay, gentlemen. 
 First thing we do is pull back on the slide here while engaging this. 
 Does anybody know what that's called? 
 Get comfortable, people. 
 Looks like we're in for a long day. 
 
 
 
 [Upbeat music] 
 ♪ 
 Yo, I tried to sneak down again last night. 
 You know she's sleeping in the living room? 
 Yeah, Charlie always sleeps downstairs when she's making sauce. 
 Yeah, but 3 days in a row? 
 That's, like, 21/2 days too many. 
 Consider it an exercise in delayed gratification. 
 Speaking of, man. 
 You and Ashika never... 
 Nope. Nothing. 
 Not once? 
 Nothing. 
 She not your type, or you just couldn't get it up? 
 You could tell me, bro. It's safe. Safe tree. 
 Wow, you really just think of this as summer camp, don't you? [Laughs] 
 We don't have summer camp in the ghetto, bro. 
 So now you're making up for a crappy childhood. 
 Makes sense. My childhood was all right. 
 Look, I didn't need my rich lawyer daddy to send me off to make friendship bracelets. 
 Of course not. You were too busy flexing your street cred with the Vatos. 
 Bro, you really think I get off on this, don't you? 
 These are the same guys who used to jump me 'cause they said I wasn't a real Mexican, 'cause I didn't bang. 
 And my brother Tony got this same tattoo, and we never saw him again. 
 You wanted me to be an  ese,  I'm being an  ese  for you. 
 If you bail again, we got nothing. 
 And the judge ain't gonna issue a longer sentence because your U.C. was authentic. 
 Remember that. Whatever, man. 
 Tell Pedro we're about here. 
 Yo, Pedro, how's it looking from the rear? 
 All good. You guys staying civil up there? 
 You know it. 
 Like bunkmates at summer camp. 
 What's up? 
 We're pulling up now. 
 104. We'll hang back till you've got a deal or verified the overgrow. Pull over. 
 Yo, this don't look like no grass to me. 
 You're very astute. 
 That's, uh, cucumber over there. 
 That's eggplant over there. 
 And everything is certified organic, homeodynamic. 
 And I think what you're looking for is over there in that barn. 
 Okay. 
 I recall that you loved oolong tea. 
 Nope. 
 Yup. 
 But you always made me drink it. 
 Yes, you did. A woman knows. 
 Hey, Dheera, come here. 
 What's oolong tea? 
 Why don't you cook up a big pot of oolong? 
 Okay? Mwah. 
 Yo, I like tea. 
 Man, there's nothing like a hot cup of tea on a really cold night. 
 [Chuckles] And we had a lot of cold nights. 
 Hell yeah. 
 Yeah. 
 I never wanna sleep in a semi cab again. 
 Do you remember that one time... yeah, with the sheriff. 
 In the woods? 
 Mmhmm. Living on sardines and fritos, agh. 
 Oh, my God. Oh! Dude, the fireflies. 
 Both : Yeah. 
 Yo, have you guys ever seen fireflies when they all light up at the same time? 
 When I was a kid, one time we drove to Kansas City to visit  mi tio y tia,  and at night when you hit the headlights, they just all light up, like, all green all at one time. 
 I never knew why they did it though, you know? 
 Courtship. 
 Courtship? 
 Yeah, it's natural mate selection. 
 [Chuckles] Oh, that's awesome. 
 So, um, you think we could see the harvest? 
 No. [Laughs] 
 The plants are on a U.V. cycle, so I can't show you until the morning. Yeah. 
 Uh, Ashika, so what are we doing here? 
 'Cause your friend acted like a [Speaking spanish]. 
 And I wanted to give him a chance to grow on me. 
 All right. That's fair. 
 She's not gonna make this deal. 
 We drove five hours out here for what? 
 Dinner. I made chili. [Cell phone chimes] 
 You made chili? 
 Yeah. 
 Yo, yo, you speaking my language. 
 Oh, you know what? I got somewhere to be. 
 Chill. We could do it. 
 I wanna ask you something. 
 Do you like T.V.P.? 
 I don't know. 
 What's T.V.P.? 
 Textured Vegetable Protein. 
 Yeah. 
 It's not fried, Johnny. You wouldn't like it. 
 I might like it. 
 I'm into trying new things, Jakes. 
 Yeah? 
 Yeah. 
 I'm starting to see why you like this guy. 
 Come here. Now what's this? 
 Oh, yeah. What does that say? 
 "Eastside." 
 Both : Longo. 
 Yeah. 
 Yeah. 
 Yeah, I got them all over. 
 Oh, yeah? 
 I could show you later, if you want. 
 Yeah? 
 If you got some honey for my tea. 
 I got some honey. 
 [Chuckles] 
 Son, she is a freak. [Chuckles] 
 Tell me you are not trying to get laid right now. 
 I ain't trying. It's just gonna happen. 
 Look, man... 
 No, no, no, no. 
 First of all, admit that it was a good idea I got tatted down under. It doesn't matter. 
 It does too matter. 
 Paige is calling this thing off. 
 No, no, no. Don't call it off. 
 Look, if Ashika needs to get to know me, so be it. 
 Yo, look me in my face. 
 I am not eating T.V.P. 
 Nobody's asking you to eat T.V.P. 
 Let me take one for the team, dude. 
 Yo, Johnny, yo, this girl is dangerous. 
 I'm dangerous. 
 Eastside, son. 
 Hey. 
 Both : Hey. 
 Where's Johnny? 
 He's staying for dinner. 
 [Exhales] Okay. 
 [Phone line trilling] 
 Mike who likes Georgetown girls. 
 Abby who likes crabs. 
 I think we can both agree "Abby who likes crabs" is a nickname that shouldn't stick. 
 [Laughs] 
 Hey, I'm sorry I haven't called sooner. 
 Things have been a little crazy. 
 It is absolutely okay. 
 But I actually cannot chat long. 
 I am out with some friends. Oh. I'll let you go. 
 No. You called to ask me out. 
 Let's do that first. 
 Do you wanna do dinner tomorrow? 
 I'm sorry. Did you just say, "do dinner"? 
 I think I did. 
 Despite that, I would love to. 
 Great. Oh, wait. 
 No, I have the sauce. 
 The what? 
 It's this... just this thing with my roommates. 
 Um, I can't do dinner, but I could do drinks. 
 Sure. Same old haunt? 
 Yeah. I'll see you at the drop. 
 All right. 
 [Grunts] 
 [Gun cocks] 
 [Panting] 
 You are going to be quiet. 
 Do you understand? 
 Who are you? 
 What kind of question is that, who am I? 
 You know who I am. I don't know who you are. 
 You show up and we get hit by Bobby moi. 
 And now you are running the circus. 
 It stinks to me. 
 Your boss trusts me. 
 That is his mistake. 
 [Grunts] 
 I'm gonna walk away now. 
 If I ever see you follow me again, I'll take your other eye. 
 [Metal clinking] 
 He made a heat run back to the house. 
 You made a heat run, right? 
 Of course. 
 Good boy. 
 Okay, but it doesn't matter, all right? 
 Next time Eddie might not be in a talking mood. 
 And what if he reports back to Bello? 
 No, no, no. 
 Bello did not send him after me. 
 Okay, but, Mike, if Eddie gives him anything suspicious, he'll slit your throat and dump your dead body in the L.A. river. 
 Eddie's a liability. 
 Drag his ass in. 
 We can't. 
 Why not? 
 We'd only fuel his conviction. 
 No, no, no, no. Charlie's right. 
 Yeah, we bring him in. 
 Only we're gonna fuel Bello's conviction instead. 
 Meaning what? 
 Well, these two obviously have trust issues, as evidenced by Eddie's new permanent wink, right? 
 So we just reinforce that. 
 How? 
 We get Paige to reprise her role as Bobby Moi's girlfriend. 
 And, Charlie, you bring him in. 
 You drag me all the way here to watch this dumb bitch cry? 
 "Dumb bitch," that's nice. 
 No wonder she's diming on you. 
 Diming on me? 
 I've never seen her before. 
 Right. 
 I swear to you, I wasn't involved. 
 You gonna tell me you don't recognize him? 
 Bobby moi. 
 That's his girl in the other room. 
 And that has what to do with me? 
 Because a couple of weeks ago, Bobby moi stole a truckload of bullets from your boss. 
 This morning I'm hearing all this talk that Bobby got his intel from an Eddie in Bello's organization. 
 You are setting me up. 
 Tracked the name Eddie to you. 
 Tracked the rumors to her. 
 Lawyer. 
 You know, girlfriends hear a lot of personal business. 
 Lawyer. 
 You sure? 
 I assume you, uh... 
 You use the same counsel that your boss keeps on retainer, right? 
 Yeah. 
 I wouldn't want that getting back to him either. 
 He knows we trumped this up. 
 Yep. 
 And he can go right to Bello and tell him that the FBI knows more than they should. 
 Yep. 
 But he won't because... 
 'Cause right about now, Bello's getting word that Eddie sold him out to Bobby moi. 
 Wait a minute. 
 This isn't a bluff? 
 Mm-mm. 
 Hey, listen. 
 I can't offer you Witness Protection unless you give me something, Eddie. 
 Not going to happen. 
 All right. 
 Then I'm gonna put you on a bus. 
 I have a girl here. 
 Well, now you got a ticket to flagstaff. 
 I'll have another FBI agent waiting for you outside. 
 I'll take your ticket. 
 But I want nothing else to do with you crooked sons of bitches. 
 If we spread that rumor, we are writing his death warrant. 
 No, actually he signed it himself when he took a job with a guy who pours hot lead in people's eyeballs. 
 We are giving Bello an excuse to do something worse. 
 Uhuh. 
 Really, we're giving Eddie the chance to walk away.

 Hey, boo. 
 He's still not picking up. 
 God forbid he makes any of this easy on us. 
 Hey, it's not how I would've done it, but he did confirm the overgrow. 
 No, I-I should keep that. 
 When Johnny's outside, I'll call in the tac team. 
 No. I'm not waiting around if he's knee deep in whackjob. 
 As soon as I'm in the barn, I'm gonna call it in. 
 Okay, do not rush this. 
 Oh, I'ma rush this.

 [Knocks] 
 All right, dude, in retrospect, it probably wasn't a good idea to stay the night. 
 Johnny, I swear to God. 
 I'm sorry, man.

 [Gun cocks] 
 Don't move, asshole. 
 Dale, I mean, I thought that we had something really special together. 
 No, we really didn't. 
 No, we really didn't, but I didn't want this to end with you buried behind my barn. 
 Yeah, I think that's an awesome reason to let us go. 
 No, you, I'm not gonna hesitate putting in the ground. 
 Really? Even after last night? 
 I mean, you were baying like a coyote. 
 Okay. 
 I thought you liked it, I'm sorry. 
 Thank you. 
 Get a 20? 
 Okay. 
 [Radio static] Anyone have a visual? 
 Oh, wow. 
 Did you go states? 
 You idiot. 
 No. 
 Did you get arrested? 
 Not quite. [Police radio chatter] 
 You're a goddamn cop, aren't you? 
 [Gunfire] 
 Lady, I don't know who you are, but you're making a big mistake. 
 I'm a federal drug enforcement agent. 
 Weapons on the ground! 
 This is not gonna go well for you unless you have a rocket launcher back there. 
 You're outgunned. 
 [Machine gun firing] 
 [Grunts] 
 [Gunshot] 
 Come here. 
 I'm gonna paint this barn Dale-colored unless you come out and you drop your goddamn weapon. 
 Drop it. 
 That's it. 
 Aah! 
 Your chili sucks! 
 I got her. 
 Hey, Dale. 
 Next time mute the walkie, yeah? 
 Why? 
 I figure you'd just smash this barn with the truck, come in shootin', no problem. 
 Hey, thanks for the save. 
 Yeah, man. 
 You get stuff like this at summer camp? 
 No. Friendship bracelets. 
 Ah, Johnny, man, you're stepping on my toes, son. 
 Hey, stop pushing! 
 Relax. I made pounds of this stuff. 
 Okay, Mike, are you ready for a whole new world of flavor up in your face? 
 I skipped my last two meals for this. 
 Come on. Let's go. Kid's a quick study. 
 Sucks, man, I had to eat some crappy T.G.S. crap last night. 
 T.V.P. Yo, I warned you. 
 John, John. 
 Did you really spend the night with that marijuana farmer? 
 [Laughter] 
 Mike. 
 What? What? 
 "Marijuana farmer"? 
 I know you're a white boy, but come on, man, that sounded ridiculous. 
 Never say that again. Don't ever say that again. 
 Kids don't say "marijuana," Michael. 
 I'm not a kid, what... hey, you better be one when you're out on the street, though. 
 What do the kids even call it these days? 
 Alphabetical order? 
 Reverse. 
 In reverse? 
 Mm-hmm. 
 Zambi, weed, stack, root, reefer... don't say reefer. 
 No, no, no. It's making a comeback. 
 It is. 
 Take my word on it. 
 Pot, kush, herb, ganj, ganja, Gandhi, dope... chillums for some reason. 
 And my personal favorite... baby. 
 Hey, yo, you got some of that baby? 
 There you go. 
 Nailed it. 
 That's not bad, son. 
 Okay. 
 Thank you. I had a stroke for a minute. 
 Gentlemen, lady, [foreign phrase] 
 The story of Francesca and Niccolo may be 1,000 years old, but they waited the same three days we waited. 
 And we're not running from the inquisition. 
 We are the inquisition. 
 Okay. 
 Can we get right to the "without further ado" part? 
 Without further ado, let's enjoy sauce night, kids. 
 [Overlapping chatter] 
 Hey, uh, is it a coincidence that sauce night happens to fall on the weekend that I have the dishes? 
 Nobody here's that devious, Mike. 
 I have a date after this. 
 Yeah? 
 Oh, yeah, yeah. 
 That little east coast number, huh? 
 Yeah. 
 Yeah. 
 I'm sure the dishes will be here when you get back. 
 You sure? 
 Am I sure the dishes will be here when you get back? Yeah. 
 No, I mean, thanks. 
 [Phone chimes] 
 [Indistinct chatter] 
 Briggs? Yeah? 
 It's Bello. 
 We have to go, don't we? 
 Yep, dishes can wait. Bello can't. 
 Hey, guys, we gotta run. We got business, okay? 
 What are you talking about? 
 What? 
 All right, man. 
 [Speaking spanish] 
 All right. I'm gonna eat your food. 
 A little late to be getting started. 
 Never had to fire your weapon in the evening? 
 Yeah, but they're nowhere near that lesson yet. 
 Today I teach the lessons. 
 Bring him out. 
 They say power is a matter of perception. 
 I've always disagreed with that. 
 We don't perceive power. We remember it. 
 You understand? 
 Maybe you don't. 
 You can't threaten the hand if you haven't reddened the face. 
 He is working with the feds, boss. 
 I followed him. 
 And the next thing I know, they bring me in. 
 Tell me about the feds. 
 They drag me out of my flat and then made up a lie I was working with Bobby moi. 
 But you weren't working with Bobby moi, were you, Eddie? Of course not, boss. 
 Of course not. 
 The feds, they made up all those lies about you. 
 Lies, all lies. 
 Yeah. And then you called your girlfriend. 
 Yes. 
 And told her you were going to Arizona. 
 I did not tell them anything. 
 You were on the bus, Edward! 
 Are you working with the FBI? 
 No. 
 I have been with you since the beginning. 
 He is nobody. 
 He is no one. 
 Give me your gun, Michael. 
 Let him go. 
 I am going to take your eye, you piece of trash. 
 This is going to end one of two ways. 
 Don't! 
 Go! Go now! 
 [Exhales] 
 Oh, my God. 
 Wait, wait, wait, wait. 
 That's Warren. 
 Now he has his pizza box. 
 Hi. 
 Hi there, stranger. 
 I'm sorry I'm late. 
 No sweat. 
 I was overdue for some solo boozing. 
 How was the sauce? 
 What? 
 Your thing? 
 You didn't go? 
 I, um... 
 [Exhales] 
 Hey, what's going on with you? 
 There was an accident. 
 Oh, my God. Are you hurt? 
 No. I saw it. 
 Did the person... 
 Yeah. 
 Christ. 
 All right, look. Go home. 
 We have a date. 
 Mike, go. 
 Come on, you are not gonna be good company anyway. 
 Thank you. 
 [Softly] Of course. 
 [Sighs] 
 You want a hand with those? No. 
 I think I actually wanna be alone right now. 
 I see they left you a plate. 
 I thought there were no leftovers. 
 Ah. Charlie likes you. 
 Hey, Briggs. 
 Why don't you eat it? I don't have an appetite. 
 No, man, just heat it up tomorrow. 
 No, you missed sauce night too. 
 Yeah. 
 It's just sauce, Mike.
