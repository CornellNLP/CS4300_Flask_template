 Previously on  Graceland... 
 You will end their training soon. 
 Think about positioning yourself to become his new bodyguard. 
 I can put Briggs in a position to recover an insane amount of drugs. 
 Or steal. 
 I did it. 
 You're in? 
 I got a look at his calendar. 
 Bigfoot is the name of their operation for ducking the new predator drones. 
 They bring the drugs in by submarine. 
 Odin Rossi's mark. 
 You know Odin? 
 I'd like to meet him. 
 As soon as you get here, Quinn is going to get Odin. 
 He's dead. I killed him. 
 We're calling this thing off. 
 He didn't die for nothing. 
 So where's Odin Rossi? 
 How's he late? I thought he was a God. 
 Did you know that undercover cops can't do drugs? 
 You've seen us use. 
 Haven't seen you use mine. 
 I wanna meet this God. 
 [Exhales] 
 ♪ 
 Whistler. 
 No. No. 
 Just drop the needle. 
 [Car horn honking] 
 [Keys rattling] 
 [Door unlocks] 
 Jesus! 
 Briggs, I'm sorry. 
 I'm sorry. 
 Tranquilo, mami. 
 I'm not trying to scare you, okay? 
 Goddamn. 
 Jesus Christ, Charlie. 
 Brought you some stuff. 
 Water, tea, bananas, bread. 
 Thank you. 
 Yeah. 
 You don't look so good. 
 Yeah, well, I look better than I feel. 
 Oh, yeah? 
 Yeah. 
 Hey, hey, hey, hey. 
 Easy, easy. Come here, baby. 
 Come here, come here, come here, come here. 
 Oh, God, that stuff knocks you on your ass, huh? 
 Yeah. 
 How much do you remember, huh? 
 I remember shooting with Quinn's needle and feeling really, really good. 
 Mmhmm. 
 And then I, um, I think I was hauled out of there, right? 
 Yeah. Yeah, that was me. 
 So Odin? 
 Well, it was between you and him. 
 I chose you, Charlie. 
 So it was all for nothing. 
 Whistler died for nothing. 
 Let's just be glad that you didn't. 
 Yeah. 
 I blew it. No. 
 Yeah. 
 No. 
 The only thing you need to be worried about right now is getting better, okay? 
 This is not some hangover that you can cure with pedialyte and gatorade. 
 Yeah. 
 You're gonna be sick for a few days. 
 It sucks. 
 But you can stay here as long as you need to. 
 Where am I? 
 Uh, one of my C.I.'s apartments. 
 Yeah. 
 Hey, Briggs. 
 Yeah? 
 Hmm? 
 I wanna go home. 
 I-I wanna be in my own bed. 
 I get that, but you can't go back to Graceland. 
 Not right now. 
 Why not? 
 Because if the bureau catches wind of this, Charlie, you will be done dada, okay? 
 Out of here, you can forget about Graceland. 
 You'll be looking for a whole new line of work, babe. 
 I brought you here to save your career. 
 Thank you, Paul. 
 This will be our little secret. 
 Get some rest. 
 [Door opens and shuts] 
 [Sobs] 
 [Rock music] 
 Moving closer for verification. 
 Pursuing verified target. 
 Hold your positions. 
 Narco sub just surfaced. 
 [Sirens wail] 
 This is the drug enforcement agency. 
 You are surrounded. 
 There is no escape. 
 Proceed to shore and surrender your vessel or you will be boarded. 
 Come out slowly with your hands up. 
 [Laughs] 
 And of course it's one of my cousins. 
 All right, I better get on board and secure the evidence, 'cause this is my bust. 
 And we did all the heavy lifting. 
 No way I'm giving the bureau credit for this one. 
 Come on, we gave you the tip-off. 
 Sir, the caza cartel has a nasty habit of leaving bombs behind. 
 I've seen my fair share of IEDs. 
 And I do have a good eye for... 
 Booby traps? 
 Yeah, so I think it's a great idea that Tuturro goes on instead of one of our guys. 
 Can't argue with that. 
 Next time you say "booby traps," look me in the eyes. 
 You know I'm just kidding, babe. 
 What's up, player? Lost, bro? 
 Hey, Johnny, how's it going? 
 There's definitely been two dudes living down here for a while. 
 I need to come up for some air. 
 Oh, my God, it stinks down there. 
 Ugh, talk about a yellow submarine. 
 What'd you find? 
 Not a damn thing. 
 It's empty? 
 No drugs at all. 
 Hell with it, it's not every day we get to put one of these out of commission. 
 Yeah, taking down a narco sub sure looks good on a resume too. 
 Still, you could buy a fleet of subs with the drugs that ain't on this one. 
 [Police sirens] 
 Where they are supposed to be, because I know you're not stupid enough to bring them here. 
 Where are they supposed to be? 
 I don't care that your sub was captured. 
 I need my drugs. 
 The next one will be right on time. 
 It had better be! 
 Did I seem angry? 
 Fooled me. What's up? 
 The feds stopped one of the cartel's submarines, the one hauling my shipment. 
 That's tough luck. 
 Luck has nothing to do with it. 
 The cartel assures me that the drugs are perfectly safe. 
 The product is towed in a torpedo body. 
 If the DEA intercepts the submarine, they cut the torpedo loose. 
 So, what, it's just sitting at the bottom of the ocean? 
 The cartel will retrieve it once the coast is clear. 
 So why were you so pissed? 
 My show of anger got them to discount 15%. 
 Business, Mike. Always business. 
 I'm surprised they'd be so careless. 
 What do you mean? 
 Well, I mean, a fishing boat could snag it, the feds could find it, or it could just disappear. 
 It's a big ocean. Things get lost. 
 You want me to betray one of the most dangerous cartels in the world? 
 It's $20 million. 
 Free drugs. 
 Who are you, eh? 
 I'm going to say this once. 
 Do not try to be something you are not. 
 I was just looking out for you, sir. 
 We don't know where they dropped it. 
 The ocean is big. 
 What if I knew someone who specialized in just that sort of thing? 
 I'd say I didn't know you if the wrong people found out. 
 They won't. 
 If you didn't think it was possible, why would they? 
 Tell me about it on the ride. 
 [Sighs] 
 [Upbeat rock music] 
 ♪ 
 Michael, Jonathan would like a word. 
 Hey, yo,  Rawhide, Outlaw's Daughter, The Silver Whip. 
 Dude, unless these are dirty movies, you best be getting them off my DVR. 
 What do you have against westerns? 
 I love westerns, 'cause I'm a man. 
 What I don't love is them recording over my episodes of  swamp loggers. 
 They'll be gone soon. 
 Thank you. 
 Like Bello. 
 We heard the tape. 
 So you like my plan? 
 Eh. 
 All I need is a diver to go down there and get those drugs, bring them up, put them in Bello's hands, you guys ride in, take him out. 
 Yeah, would have been great if you ran that brilliant idea past your training officer first. 
 Briggs, there was a moment, and I grabbed it. 
 Right, and now in the moment we have to create and backstop a believable undersea recovery expert... 
 [Snaps] Like that. 
 With the resources that the bureau has, I think we'll be able to find somebody. 
 You got somebody. 
 Uh, Johnny, I'm not sold on that, bro. 
 You? 
 Mikey, I'm a Navy seal. 
 Whoa, almost. 
 Almost? 
 Yeah. 
 I got hit by a boat my last day of hell week. 
 Ow. 
 Thus I'm not sold. 
 Look, this is why you need me. 
 I'm a seal. We don't have resumes. 
 Everything's classified. 
 You're feeling this, right? 
 Congratulations, John, you're now a seal. 
 Dude. 
 Now remember, Mike, in Bello's world, vouching for somebody carries consequences, life or death consequences, you know. 
 Like you vouched for me. 
 I learned from the best. 
 Hmm. 
 This is a good read. 
 Like a Robert Ludlum novel. 
 The Warren entanglement. 
 You find the torpedo, give Briggs time alone with the drugs, and then catch him in the act. 
 Yeah. 
 I hand him the heroin on a silver platter, and you may get his head in return. 
 Well, remind me never to mess with you. 
 You'd make a hell of a bad guy. 
 Can I ask you something? 
 What if we're wrong about Briggs? 
 Bello, Briggs, these are dangerous men. 
 They want you to doubt your instincts. 
 I want you to trust them. 
 You do that, you catch them both. 
 Then what? 
 I don't know, you make deputy director at 35 instead of 40. 
 Does it get me back to D.C.? 
 This is a marathon, Mike, not a sprint. 
 All right, it's not about how fast you get back to Washington. 
 It's about making sure you get back there in one piece. 
 Thanks. 
 [Distant sirens] 
 [Retches] 
 [Cell phone rings] 
 [Ringing continues] 
 Hello. 
 Chuckie, Briggs told me you had to rush out of Quinn's. 
 How you doing? You know. 
 Still thinking about Whistler, huh? 
 Yeah, man, that rocked me. 
 Yeah, I haven't seen you since. 
 Where are you? 
 Fontana. 
 Fontucky? Nice. 
 At least I know you're relaxing out there. 
 Nobody relaxes in Fontana. 
 I'm actually on a case. 
 I thought it'd be best to, you know, stay busy. 
 Yeah, you don't sound too good, mama. 
 I'm fine, Johnny. 
 What's going on there? 
 Oh, you know, usual ass covering. 
 So check it out, looks like the boss told the higher-ups that we were gonna get Odin on this one and that we left him with his dick in his hand when the bust fell through. 
 Yeah, but Briggs went in and explained the whole thing, right? 
 He did, but Caldwell must think he's covering for us because he wants you and me to come in and give our side of it. 
 When? 
 Asap. Tomorrow, 9:00 A.M. 
 Um... Yeah, I don't... 
 I don't really know if that's possible. 
 I don't know if I can... if I can get out of here. 
 Yeah, he wasn't asking. 
 Jesus. 
 Best not give him another reason to crawl up our asses, you know? 
 I'll see you in the morning, all right? 
 Be good. 
 All right. 
 Flying solo, Mr. pilot? 
 Just waiting for a girl. 
 A girl? 
 Mm-hmm. 
 Not a woman? 
 No, you're right, a woman. 
 Definitely a woman. 
 What's she look like? 
 Maybe I could help you find her. 
 Oh, no, I think I'd know if she was here. 
 She's beautiful. 
 She's got these big brown eyes and long brown hair. 
 And she's got this way about her. 
 She just always makes me feel good. 
 I didn't know that. 
 Yeah. 
 It's like, no matter how bad a day I'm having, she just makes everything better. 
 If this girl's half as good as she sounds, I don't know if I can compete. 
 Maybe I should get you out of here before she shows up. 
 How far is that beachfront mansion of yours? 
 What's wrong with your place? 
 Yours is closer. 
 Well, my roommates are a bit untidy. 
 Ooh. 
 Thought it was only pilots that got shot down. 
 It's not like that, all right? 
 Come on, are you keeping them from me, or are you keeping me from them? 
 Of course not, all right? 
 Good, then let's hang out. 
 At least with Paige. 
 I owe her a thank you for something. 
 Okay. 
 Thank you very much. 
 [Distant sirens] 
 Briggs, hand me my clothes. 
 Fine. 
 I'm telling you, you show up at that meeting, he's gonna figure it out. 
 I have no choice. 
 Yeah, actually you could call in sick. 
 Caldwell's a freaking bloodhound. 
 He'll find me. 
 Don't you remember when you missed the sexual harassment seminar? 
 He tracked me down at a goddamn strip club. 
 I mean, even if I ditch him, the bureau will be at my door giving me a random drug test. 
 I'm screwed, aren't I? 
 Am I screwed? 
 Yeah. 
 What am I gonna do? 
 I can't lose my job. You gotta help me. 
 There's gotta be something that we can do. 
 There has to be something. 
 Nah. 
 Yeah. There is something. 
 Tell me. 
 I'm going either way. 
 Hair of the dog. 
 You want me to take more of that sh1t? 
 Are you crazy? Where'd you get that? 
 My C.I. keeps a stash. 
 What do you want me to do, Charlie, bust him again? 
 You want me to go in there high? 
 You're crazy. 
 I'm not saying go in there high, but I could give you just enough so that you can maybe pass for normal. 
 God, this is messed up. 
 Look, Charlie, 100 milligrams is not gonna turn you into a skag hag, all right? 
 It'll get you through this, and then we can get the junk out of your system. 
 You know what's scaring me is that I, uh... 
 I actually want it. 
 Yeah. 
 All right. 
 You don't have to do this. 
 Give me the damn needle. 
 I can't. 
 Easy with it. Good. 
 There you go. 
 Welcome back. 
 What? 
 You've been staring at me like my mother ever since we left the house, what? 
 Is that really how a Navy seal would dress? 
 Shut up, man. 
 You expect me to come out of the house wearing a freaking wetsuit and a rebreather? 
 Listen, man, I'm just saying. 
 That's my choice, man. 
 Okay. 
 What? 
 We're good. 
 Hey, man, why'd you want to join the Navy? 
 My Uncle Enrique. 
 Told me I could see the world. 
 What he didn't tell me was that I'd spend six months a pop on a boat with a bunch of dudes. 
 When I told my C.O. I was getting cabin fever, he said, "cool, pack your seabag. 
 We're shipping you off to Iraq." 
 I didn't know they could do that. 
 Yeah. 
 You know, naturally they gave us all the grunt work. 
 I spent two years of my life blowing up hajji ordnance and IEDs. 
 What, like  Hurt Locker  stuff? 
 Never saw it. 
 I don't want to relive that sh1t, bro. 
 I don't even want to watch the porno version of that. 
 Figured I'd join the Navy seals. 
 And when that didn't work out I said, "screw it, I already got my citizenship." 
 Wait, John, you weren't an American? 
 Wait, tell me what you have against hardworking immigrants who come here for a piece of the American dream. 
 Me, Bello. 
 Look, I respect you and Bello with equal measure. 
 Hmm. [Chuckles] 
 He's cool. 
 Sir, this is Johnny serrano. 
 What makes you think that he's the right guy? 
 Johnny's an ex-Navy seal. 
 Why no longer? 
 I served my country honorably for 32,400 bucks a year. 
 Serving myself is a lot more lucrative. 
 Reminds me of someone I know. 
 Johnny and I have been buddies now for five, six years. 
 You are different branches of the military. 
 Drinking buddies, he means. 
 Yeah. 
 Yeah. 
 So you were stationed in San Diego too? 
 That's classified. 
 Have you ever conducted a recovery operation? 
 You remember when they dumped Bin Laden's body at sea? 
 Mm. 
 Let's just say it used to be on the ocean floor. 
 Really? 
 Hell, no, it's classified. 
 Look, man, as far as I'm concerned, this is just one more classified mission. 
 But if you want my help, I'm gonna need some details. 
 It's classified. 
 That's funny, that's funny. 
 Sorry, man, I'm not risking my life for this. 
 Ocean's too unforgiving. 
 So am I. 
 You think I haven't seen worse than you, bro? 
 We are looking for a three-meter torpedo canister. 
 It weighs at least a hundred kilos. 
 Where is it? 
 I don't know. That's why I need you. 
 Who else is looking for it? 
 A few other people. 
 They have a transponder frequency. 
 We don't. 
 All right, so I'm gonna assume it's valuable, so I'm gonna assume they're dangerous, which Jacks up my finder's fee to 10%. 
 I'll give you a flat fee of 15,000. 
 Sounds like a deal. 
 20,000. 
 Done. 
 We believe it was jettisoned off of long beach. 
 Okay. 
 This is San Pedro bay, yeah? 
 Eight ball is your torpedo. 
 I bet that's appropriate, right? 
 Cue ball, my boat. 
 Now we can forget about using the transponder because it's scrambled. 
 So use a side-scan radar. 
 A side-scan radar gives you a nice slice of the ocean in 3-d. 
 For what you want, side-scan radar isn't reliable enough. 
 Which is why I would use multibeam. 
 Gives you a nice detailed view of the ocean floor. 
 So when can we get started? 
 We just did. 
 [Whistles] 
 Oh, yeah. 
 All right. 
 
 
 
 So, champ, how do you feel? 
 Scared. 
 Hmm. 
 Well, that's an improvement, right? 
 What are you gonna tell him? Same thing you did. 
 Quinn tried to force us to shoot up till, uh, till we snuck out of there. 
 Mmhmm. 
 Even has the benefit of being true, mostly. 
 Yeah. 
 Um, how do I look? 
 Look in my eyes. 
 Yeah, you're good. 
 I mean, you're a little blurry, but... well, the eye drops probably dilated your pupils. 
 Now, look, when you start to come down off this stuff, remember to watch yourself, okay? 
 Resist the impulse to fidget. 
 No sudden movements. Don't look like a hype. 
 I've played a cover before, Paul. 
 Yeah, I know, but you're used to playing high. 
 Now you're high, and you're trying to play sober. 
 It's not as easy as you'd think. 
 I don't need a goddamn instructional video. 
 Thank you. 
 Look at that, she's a natural. 
 Kiss my ass. 
 [Chuckles] 
 There's the Charlie we all know and love. 
 When I spoke to agent Briggs, he said he nearly came to blows with Quinn. 
 Yeah, he insisted we shoot his heroin to prove we weren't undercovers. 
 Naturally, we couldn't do that. 
 Why didn't you leave? 
 Because his thugs would have stopped us. 
 How did you get out? 
 I pretended to go back to the bathroom to check on Whistler. 
 Nothing dampens a party like a dead junkie. 
 So you lost your C.I. 
 That's right. Overdose on Quinn's stuff. 
 Quinn was bragging about it all night, how it messed up Whistler. 
 Once Whistler OD'd, you had Quinn on conspiracy to distribute resulting in death. 
 How could you let him walk? 
 'Cause Quinn wasn't our primary suspect. 
 It was Odin, and Odin didn't show. 
 That charge carries 25 to life. 
 You could have flipped Quinn, had him turn on Odin. 
 Agent, are you with me? 
 Yes, sir. 
 Well? 
 She didn't have a choice, sir. 
 They were outnumbered, outgunned. 
 If they tried to take Quinn down by themselves, they'd be dead. 
 My tac team was too far away to do any good. 
 That's on me. Johnny, don't. 
 She couldn't take a chance on things going South. 
 Finally, the truth. 
 That's not how it went down. 
 I think it is. 
 I understand you trying to cover for your roommate. 
 This has to go in my report. 
 I can't let you do that. 
 Charlie, he's right. 
 The truth had to come out. Sir, I apologize. 
 Thank you. 
 That's all. 
 What's up, Chuckie? 
 Hmm? 
 Normally you down three of these for every two of mine. 
 Well, I'm sorry if I'm a little down, Johnny. 
 That's when you eat the most. 
 Baby, I know a crash when I see it. 
 What's up? 
 I shot one of Quinn's syringes, and I messed myself up. 
 What? 
 Johnny, it was getting so crazy in there. 
 Quinn had his thugs, they had heat. 
 Briggs was in their face. 
 I knew, if I didn't shoot up, we weren't getting out of there. 
 You knew I'd get there for you. 
 I just kept seeing Whistler's face. 
 Seeing him lay there on that filthy bathroom floor. 
 He didn't deserve that, man. 
 Why were you high in the eval today? 
 Whatever it takes to save my career, man. 
 Gotta shoot a little heroin to level out, that's what I gotta do. 
 So Briggs knows too, huh? 
 Yeah, but it doesn't matter, 'cause I'm the one who did it. 
 I'm the one who messed up. 
 Not according to the report, Chuck. 
 Now I'm the one who let Quinn walk, thanks. 
 I'm sorry, Johnny. 
 I don't care what the story was. 
 I don't care where you went or what you did. 
 Just come home. 
 All right? 
 Let me help you get better. 
 You hear me? 
 Mmhmm. Yeah. 
 I love you. 
 I love you too. 
 Actually, I moved here to become a punk singer, but apparently nobody's really looking for a female iggy pop. 
 Surprising. 
 At least as a spin instructor I still get to yell at people. 
 You can yell at me anytime you want. 
 Down boy. 
 Um, Abby, so what do you do? 
 I've been a student mainly. 
 But last summer I worked for a senator. 
 Impressive. 
 My dad pulled a few strings. 
 Looks like you might need a fancier job, Mr. pilot. 
 I don't know. 
 There's nothing quite like the thrill of flying. 
 Tell me about it, I used to fly Cessnas. 
 No way. Really? 
 Well, a buddy of mine, he had a netjet membership. 
 We'd go up in the cockpit and have a couple beers. 
 So you guys didn't actually pilot the plane. 
 Vance here is a D.J. 
 I'm guessing you haven't heard of a club downtown called Primatology? 
 No way, that is my girlfriend's favorite club. 
 Oh, my God, what night are you on? 
 Um no, he mainly does private events and things like that. 
 I'm usually there on Tuesdays, but, um, here, here's my card. 
 Give me a call. 
 I'll show you the full V.I.P. treatment. 
 On a Tuesday. 
 Damn right. 
 Is that how you guys met? 
 Kinda. 
 I was walking downtown one night, and this super hot chick, she runs up to me, and she notices my shirt. 
 I mean, I'm kind of his first groupie, so... 
 You know what, for some reason I think she won't be your last. 
 Thanks, Mike. Thanks. 
 Hey, Paige, can I talk to you for a sec? 
 Absolutely. 
 So you brought your case on our date. 
 Relax, Mike, he's just a dealer. 
 Hmm. Great. He's perfect. 
 Look around here. 
 Most of the people in here are dealers. 
 Okay, he's just my way into an ecstasy ring, and he's not even worth flipping. 
 Paige. 
 Abby thinks this is a real date. 
 Is it? 
 You're pretending that you can have a real relationship. 
 And if you were being honest with yourself, you'd know that that isn't possible. 
 Not with what we do. 
 Okay, look, the only way that you should continue dating is if she starts committing crimes. 
 I think she just stole the salt. 
 She did. 
 Pretty incredible guy, right? 
 Why, 'cause he's so handsome or because he was so dumb? 
 Please, no, because he's a drug dealer. 
 Get out of here. 
 D.J. Afroburn gave me his card because he wanted to sell me drugs. 
 I thought he was just flirting with you. 
 You jealous now? 
 Think we should tell Paige? 
 I have a feeling she already knows. 
 I mean, she was acting kinda different around him. 
 Don't you think? 
 Yeah. 
 He's not really her type. 
 I don't get that. 
 I would never act different around a guy, and I hope you wouldn't act different around me. 
 I do. 
 I'm better. 
 Corny. 
 Oh, come on. 
 It's true, though. 
 [Both chuckle] 
 Hey, yo, fam. 
 What's up, man? 
 Heard the eval went all right. 
 Yeah. Why wouldn't it? 
 Talked to the coast guard. 
 Got them to do most of the heavy lifting for us on this torpedo deal. 
 They picking it up or what? 
 Well, they got a few pings. 
 Bathymetric says this one right here as the most probable. 
 I say we do a little recon, make sure it's our target. 
 Give you a chance to get familiarized with your new boat, skipper. 
 Should we bring gilligan along or what? 
 Eh, let Mike get his rest. 
 The only thing he has to do tomorrow is look surprised. 
 Why didn't you tell me about Charlie? 
 'Cause I told her I wouldn't. 
 What's done is done, J.T. 
 This is right, right? I mean... 
 All right, first of all, I wouldn't start there. 
 No? 
 Dead smack in the middle. 
 My money, that's where it's at. 
 Man, where'd you learn to work a joystick like that, bro? 
 Ever heard of video games? 
 Come on, man, I'm serious. 
 It's classified. 
 Look, Johnny, nobody's more sorry than I am about what happened to Charlie, okay? 
 She was begging me to help her. 
 I had to do something. 
 I covered for her. 
 And for you. 
 [Beeping] I mean, I don't know, man. 
 Direct hit. 
 Hold on, let me back up. Let me clean it up first. 
 It's an mk-46. 
 Decommissioned military torpedo. 
 That's one of ours. 
 Nothing but the best for the caza cartel, huh? 
 It's explosive, you see that? 
 See the tripwire running across the top? 
 Yeah. 
 They booby-trapped the damn thing. 
 Damn assholes, man. 
 We're gonna have to abort. 
 No, no, no, no, I'm actually trained for this. 
 I'll go down there and diffuse it. 
 Put those drugs right in Bello's hands. 
 There's no need to try to be a hero, Johnny. 
 Briggs, I am the hero. 
 Yeah, "x" marks the spot. 
 Are you sure it's there? 
 If it ain't, I'll give you 20 grand. 
 Deal? 
 Way to sell it, Johnny. 
 All right,  mi familia,  let's get ready to go. 
 Thread the straps on the torpedo, okay? 
 I'm gonna inflate the lift bag and then pull me up like a fish. 
 All right, man. 
 Keep that. 
 Use this to stay in contact. 
 Hey, nobody touch nothing while I'm gone. 
 I'm looking at you. 
 Hey, Johnny, do you read me? 
 Copy that. 
 Let me try call waiting. 
 You hear me, Mike? 
 Loud and clear. 
 They didn't touch any of my stuff, did they? 
 Nah, we're all good. 
 All right, I got a visual. 
 Yeah, yeah, that's the torpedo all right. 
 Looks like I get to keep my money. 
 Good job, Johnny. 
 May I? 
 Excellent work. 
 How much longer will you be? 
 It's sitting flat, so five minutes to get the straps in place, another couple to inflate the bag. 
 The sooner the better, okay? 
 What's he doing? 
 Fishing I suppose. 
 That's a big fish. 
 Your friend's part is almost over. 
 He won't be going back to shore with us. 
 Whoa, wait, wait, wait a minute. 
 You can't do this, all right? 
 Johnny's done everything you asked for. 
 This guy's a total pro, okay? 
 Doesn't mean that he won't share war stories with his drinking buddies, huh? 
 That money buys a lot of beer, but we can't take a chance with the cartel. 
 Best to tie up all the loose ends. 
 You don't think somebody's gonna notice him missing? 
 If he's a pro, no one knows he's here. 
 His final classified mission. 
 Okay. Okay. 
 Hey, Johnny, I'm about to go Peyton Manning on you, buddy. 
 Tell him about the booby trap, buy us some time. 
 All right, man. You got it. 
 Briggs, man, I hope you heard all that, man. 
 They are gonna kill Johnny. 
 You need to send in the cavalry right now. 
 We don't have any time. 
 Uh, fellas, we got a little problem here. 
 They booby-trapped this whole thing with semtex. 
 Is that going to be a major problem? 
 I can diffuse it, but taking bombs apart wasn't in my job description. 
 It's gonna cost you extra. 
 I'll pay you another $5,000. 
 Don't be greedy. 
 Michael, you can have his share. 
 I don't want it. 
 I thought you were much more of a mercenary than this, hmm? 
 You went out of your way to find someone who is in no way connected to me. 
 But the guy's connected to me, all right? 
 He's my friend. 
 Now I am your friend. 
 All right, then... then let me do it. 
 You need your best guy to do this. 
 Let me make it clean. 
 Please. 
 Lower your gun. 
 Fine. 
 I don't want your friend to make a mess on my new boat. 
 Thank you. 
 Hmm. 
 What do you think I should call her? 
 It's bad luck to rename your boat. 
 Eh, bad luck for the previous owner. 
 I'm just about done disarming this bomb, Briggs. 
 I really hope this works, man. 
 How's it going down there? 
 It's going. 
 I've almost got... hello? 
 Hello? Hello? 
 What the hell? You said this man was the best! 
 You know how much money you cost me? 
 This is your fault! 
 Tell me why I should not throw you down there too. 
 'Cause I was about to shoot him for you! 
 Put that thing away. 
 Do something! 
 We must leave this place now. 
 Start the engines. Pull the anchor up now. 
 We must leave this place. Go! 
 Come on, we must leave. 
 [Engine starts] 
 Michael... 
 I lost my head. 
 I am sorry for your loss. 
 Briggs, Briggs, it's me, man. 
 I think Johnny's, um... 
 Dude, you gotta call me back, all right? 
 Where the hell are you? Jesus Christ. 
 Sorry. 
 Yo, Mikey Mike. 
 That was good work. 
 Johnny. 
 John, John, John. 
 Dude, dude! Dude, nobody told you I was okay? 
 I couldn't get Briggs on the phone. 
 Why didn't you call me? 
 'Cause I thought you were dead. 
 Why would I call you? 
 Dude, is that a tear? 
 I'm touched, dude, but you really thought I was dead? 
 Look, it's not a tear, all right? 
 Mikey, I had the bomb covered the whole way. 
 It was a piece of cake. I knew it would be. 
 You knew about the bomb? 
 Yeah, we saw it on the R.O.V. 
 Briggs didn't tell you? 
 Yo, Johnny, soda machine was broken, brother. 
 I got you water instead. 
 Yo, yo, yo, Mike, chill! Dude, what are you doing? 
 What are you doing? Chill. 
 I thought Johnny was dead, Briggs. 
 Mike, relax. 
 Why didn't you tell me about the bomb? 
 I didn't want you to derail your own plan. 
 Oh, so you just make that decision for me? 
 Yes, the hell I did! 
 I mean, what did you think, Johnny just happened to find the bomb the second after you called in the cavalry? 
 God damn it, Briggs. 
 I almost shot those guys. 
 Agent Warren, I called an audible, and we scored. 
 What'd you do down there? 
 Briggs says, "surface and you're dead." 
 I pulled the semtex away from the torpedo and detonated it. 
 Had me fooled. 
 Bello too. That's the whole point, Mike. 
 I bet he was pissed when we blew up his drugs, huh? 
 That's an understatement. 
 Yeah, well, imagine how pissed he'd be if he knew we had 'em. 
 Mm, damn. [Whistles] 
 Funny thing is, they didn't pack it too well. 
 They could have fit twice as much in here. 
 Why didn't they? 
 Beats me. 
 Usually these guys don't miss a trick. 
 Well, kudos anyway, boys. 
 It's still the biggest haul I've ever seen. 
 That's for sure. Right. 
 Too bad no one can ever know we seized it. 
 Why the hell not? 
 Well, Mike, we can't exactly throw a press conference. 
 Bello would know he'd been had. 
 We have him. 
 We have him on intention to possess narcotics and attempted murder. 
 I didn't hear him tell you to kill Johnny. 
 Briggs... look, all Bello said was something about going fishing. 
 Mike, the only thing we have the guy for is stealing a boat. 
 So we're just gonna do nothing? 
 Well, I wouldn't say that. 
 Big fish like Bello lead to bigger fish, like the caza cartel. 
 We let this one play out a little while longer, we'll get 'em, you'll see. 
 I gotta go clear my head. 
 Getting punched in the face didn't quite do it for me. 
 Hmm. 
 Daddy knows best, huh? 
 Might as well keep things to himself. 
 He ain't listening to anybody else anyway. 
 I don't even know why we bothered with this. 
 We should have just blown up the drugs. 
 That's exactly what I said, but he insisted. 
 When I got out of the water I was like, "fine, man, you take it. I'm done, dude." 
 Briggs took custody of the drugs? 
 Yeah, I caught a ride with the tac team. 
 [Engine starts] 
 Home sweet home. 
 Yeah, I'm kinda relieved nobody's here. 
 You know they're gonna want to take care of you, right? 
 Yeah, that's what I'm afraid of. 
 You gonna tell 'em? 
 I mean, there's not much to tell. 
 It's not like I'll be shooting up in an alley or anything. 
 You won't? 
 [Chuckles] 
 Kill me if I do. 
 I will. 
 [Sighs] 
 Yup. I mean, it's your call, babe. 
 I'm glad to have you back, though. 
 [Horn blasting] 
 I'm glad you showed up. 
 All right, I think we're ready to get started. 
 Why doesn't everyone take your seat? 
 Do you mind if I sit here? 
 Paul, the floor is yours. 
 [Clears throat] 
 Hi, my name is Paul. 
 All : Hi, Paul. 
 I'm a heroin addict.
