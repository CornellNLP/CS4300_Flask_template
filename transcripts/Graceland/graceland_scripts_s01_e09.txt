 Previously on  Graceland... 
 You are Odin Rossi? 
 Always have been. 
 I could maintain your current levels at 85% of the cost, assuming we keep my little secret about who I am. 
 We have a deal. 
 Do you see Odin? 
 No show. 
 You guys didn't hear it? 
 Your watch went dead. 
 Why is it we could never get eyes on Odin? 
 Not a single photo, print, voice recording? Nothing? 
 No. No, no, no, no. 
 You said you wanted to help Briggs, not investigate him. 
 Get rid of Odin. 
 Come back to Caza and everything will be as it was. 
 Who's gonna come? 
 Ask him. 
 El Hombre Llave. 
 "The Key Man"? 
 Jangles. 
 The Caza Cartel's bogeyman. 
 I have something for you. 
 My grandfather shot this, didn't he? 
 He caught himself in the reflection. 
 [Cell phone rings] Yeah. 
 We need to meet. 
 I'll text you the details. 
 Just walked into U.S.A. clothing. 
 [Door bangs] 
 There's a hole in the wall. 
 Odin's here, I can feel it. 
 [Both grunting] 
 Man down, man down. 
 Back supply area. 
 What the hell happened? 
 Did you see Odin? Hmm? Did you see him? 
 [Sighs] 
 [Edgy rock music] 
 ♪ 
 [Sighs and grunts] 
 Ugh. 
 [Shower shuts off] 
 Damn it, Charlie! 
 [Snickers] 
 You know the rules. 
 Ah. 
 If somebody's in the shower, you gotta make yourself known. 
 You knew that. 
 Hi, Johnny. I'm here. 
 That kind of rule-breaking can and will be used against you, you little creep. 
 My curiosity got the best of me. 
 Yeah? Curiosity satisfied now? 
 Maybe. 
 [Slaps] 
 [Both giggle] You better stop that. 
 [Chuckles] 
 Hey, your curiosity satisfied with the, um... 
 Briggs? 
 Yeah. 
 I wish it was. 
 [Edgy rock music] 
 ♪ 
 [Groans] 
 [Ice pack crackles] 
 Ohh. 
 [Sighs] 
 Hey. 
 Hey. 
 Trading your morning run for a little sunrise meditation? 
 Nah. 
 I'm just out here counting regrets. 
 You up to double digits yet? 
 Yeah, I'm way past that. 
 You talk to Abby since... 
 No mas. 
 I liked her. 
 Yeah, me too. 
 Thought I could do it, you know. 
 Thought I could... balance everything. 
 I'm the only one who knows how reckless you got. 
 And we're gonna keep it that way. 
 Really? 
 In a place like Graceland, sometimes it's good to keep secrets. 
 Thank you. 
 We didn't find anything at his C.I.'s place. 
 We both know lack of evidence doesn't equal innocence. 
 You're still suspicious. 
 Yeah, Johnny, I guess I am. 
 Why? What reason do you have? 
 Why? 
 I told you the whole st-- [Door opens] 
 Yeah. 
 Mikey, bro, when are you gonna give it up? 
 You're never gonna top my land-speed record. 
 That's not gonna happen. 
 Any time, any place, brah. 
 Word? 
 Yeah. 
 What are you guys doin'? 
 Just helping Johnny cook. 
 Just cooking. 
 Um, yeah, sounds interesting. 
 How are my fellow super-freaks doing this morning, huh? 
 All good. 
 A'ight! 
 Little nervous, 'cause Johnny's cooking. 
 [Scoffs] Oh. 
 It's ghetto scramble. 
 Check it out: Bologna, mustard, pickles, eggs and beans. 
 Breakfast of champions. 
 Yeah, I just remembered that I am on a cleanse. 
 Me too. 
 You know scramble gives you the energy for a full day of, uh... dipping dudes' arms in lead. 
 [Laughs] 
 Wow. 
 Too soon? 
 Nah, it's cool. 
 That did take some energy. [Laughter] 
 Hey, speaking of... that message you and Bello sent back to Caza. 
 You get a response yet? 
 All quiet. 
 Mm-hmm. 
 Not for much longer, I bet. 
 If Jangles shows up, it's gonna get real bloody, real fast. 
 Bello's ready for him. 
 Bello  thinks  he is ready for Jangles. 
 Hey, let's not forget about Odin Rossi. 
 He's the connective tissue in all this. 
 He's the reason Jangles is coming in the first place. 
 Yep, plus Odin's still a ghost. 
 When Jangles can't find him, he's gonna turn on Bello and his crew, and he's gonna do it with an exclamation point. 
 But that's what I'm saying-- let's get Odin first, so we have the key to this whole thing. 
 Look, I know you want to get this guy real bad, Chuck. 
 So do I. 
 I mean, if we can catch his scent, it's all good. 
 Otherwise, I'd rather not waste the energy on the hunt, you know? 
 Okay. If that's what you think is best. 
 [Text message alert chimes] 
 Briggs, speak of the devil. 
 Mm? 
 You might be right. 
 Mm. Blood in the streets, my children. 
 Definitely gonna have to take a rain check on that, uh, ghetto scramble, Johnny. 
 You sure? 
 Yep. 
 You're missing out. 
 [Laughs] 
 Sorry, man. 
 Didn't you just say you were on a cleanse? 
 Hmm. 
 Jangles killed Bello's number one dealer. 
 He can't find Odin, so he kills the corner guy? 
 To try to get information? 
 Mm. 
 What's with the shoes? Some kind of calling card? 
 Remember how I told you that Jangles was gonna use an exclamation point? 
 Yeah. 
 Look a little bit closer, Mikey. 
 Those kicks are still kicking. 
 [Police radio chatter] 
 Wow. 
 It's unreal. 
 Yeah, that's about as real as it gets. 
 Jangles is here. 
 [Edgy rock music] 
 [Cell phone ringing] 
 Diane Motel, how may I help you? 
 Hey, I've got a room reserved for tonight for myself and a lady friend. 
 I'd like to make a discreet entrance, please. 
 I can assure you that your privacy is our highest priority. 
 That's good news. 
 Uh, could you leave the keys in your ceramic planter for me? 
 Uh, that's against our...policy. 
 What's your policy on me giving you a $100 tip? 
 The white planter or the blue one? 
 Blue. 
 Always go with blue. 
 [Keys jingle] 
 [Lock clicks] 
 [Faint TV chatter] 
 [Ocean waves crashing] 
 Ahh. 
 [Grunts] 
 [Motor whirs] 
 [Rock music on radio] 
 What's up, guys? 
 Hope you got me loud and clear. 
 Yep. 
 [Shuts radio off] 
 [Electronic beep] 
 [Jamaican accent] Welcome, Mike. 
 Hey, what do you think of my safe house? 
 Easy access to the freeway. 
 Good escape routes. 
 Can see every approach. 
 Robusto? 
 Thanks. 
 You seem, uh, happy. 
 You seem surprised. 
 Well, there's a lot going on. 
 [Guffaws] 
 They tried to scare me with dangling feet. 
 [Laughs] And it didn't work. 
 No. 
 I've seen worse. 
 Kingston, bring out the case! 
 [Locks clicking open] 
 [Rifle clacks] 
 The  federales  got a hit on it? 
 That's great. 
 Can you text me the address? 
 I owe you one, girl. 
 [Laughs] All right, bye. 
 [Laughs] Hi. 
 Hi. What's that smile? 
 What? 
 Do I have an "I'm gonna bust an asshole" smile on today? 
 That's exactly what you have on today. 
 So who's the lucky asshole? 
 All right. 
 So when we first started investigating, we found this Mexican shell company that had loose ties to Odin Rossi. 
 But there was never any movement. Nothing. 
 Dead. 
 Last night, money was taken from the company to pay for a motel room in long beach. 
 That's a big get. 
 Right? 
 A little too big. I don't-- 
 I mean, Odin never makes mistakes. 
 Hey, I've seen perfect criminals get cocky and screw up, so... 
 Oh, God. 
 From your mouth to God's ears. 
 I swear to... 
 [Laughs] 
 See you later. 
 Michael's going to show you how to use this gun. 
 When you are on the corner, do not be afraid to pull the trigger. 
 No one can take from you what is yours, if you defend it like a man! 
 Show them the basics. 
 Then send them out. 
 Yo, it's easy for him not to be afraid. 
 He stays in the safe house. 
 It's messed up, what happened to Jamal on the corner the other day. 
 But the last thing Bello wants is more bloodshed. 
 So that's why we're getting bigger guns? 
 It's called "deterrence." 
 [Cartridge clacking] 
 Hey, Briggs! 
 Yo. 
 Please tell me there's some hopeful news on the Jangles front. 
 I wish. 
 I still don't even really know what the guy looks like. 
 You know? 
 Hmm. 
 Every time I saw him, he had a bandana on his face. 
 Course, he always had those damn rattling keys. 
 But, uh, yeah, it's still all I got to go on. 
 Why? Bello's getting nervous, huh? 
 He's bringing in some intense weaponry for his boys. 
 And, uh, guess who gets to train 'em? 
 Well, you know, the Nigerian cowboy's never been one to go halfway. 
 [Scoffs] Yeah, meanwhile, on the street, there's guys with machetes... [Gun clacks] and assault rifles. 
 Yeah, you just got to hang in there, you know. 
 You know what? I'm done hanging in there. 
 Bullets are gonna start flying, and I trained these guys. 
 I'm going to the FBI, and I'm telling them we have more than enough on Bello. 
 It's time to move in. 
 No, you're not. 
 Not yet. 
 Keeping Bello in play gets us closer to Jangles. 
 Both : And Odin. 
 That's right. 
 You know, Mike, sometimes it's all about using one monster as bait to get the others. 
 I know it's tough, it's slow, but that's the job we signed up for. 
 What job is it that you've been doing? 
 I am hunting down leads, okay? 
 I'm trying to put a face to this dude. 
 I want justice, just like you do. 
 Justice? 
 Sure you don't want vengeance? 
 Little bit of both, huh? 
 Justice for a serial mass murderer, and vengeance for a sadistic b*st*rd who came this close to destroying my life with a needle. 
 Let's just call it "closure." 
 Why is Briggs still in the field? 
 I gave you everything about his addiction. 
 You said you were gonna get him help. 
 What's goin' on? 
 I submitted your report to D.C. 
 Until we hear from them, keep working the plan. 
 I need you to do this. 
 You're gonna bug him? 
 I need you to put the transmission in his jeep, and the receiver, you keep in your car. 
 [Scoffs] What exactly are we trying to find? 
 Briggs has been doing business with Caza members for years. 
 He knows the players intimately. 
 I think he's made deals for himself. 
 Why would he work with the cartel? 
 They tortured him. 
 They got him addicted to heroin. 
 [Pointed] And then they just let him walk away. 
 Why do you think Briggs has been so reluctant to move on Bello? 
 His excuse is he wants to use Bello "as bait to get to the other monsters." 
 What he really wants is to sell Bello out. 
 Yeah. 
 Yeah, you're probably right. 
 "You know, Mike, sometimes it's all about using one monster as bait..." 
 "Bait to get to the other monster." 
 [Glass shattering] 
 Hey! 
 Everything okay in here? 
 I heard a pretty dramatic crash. 
 Yeah. 
 [Sighs] 
 Frame fell. 
 Really? 
 Yeah, I don't know what happened. 
 [Laughs] 
 Well, that's too bad. 
 It was the only real "Mike Warren" decor you had in here. 
 [Snickers] 
 Now you're back down to nothing. 
 Back to zero. 
 Come here. 
 What? Oh. 
 [Paper tearing] You know... 
 I have a pretty good bullshit detector. 
 And, right now, it's going off like a banshee. 
 You know, I-- 
 I know that, for some reason, you feel like you can't really be yourself in this house. 
 But I just thought maybe-- 
 I mean, maybe if I showed you that I was on your side, that you could trust me. 
 I know you're on my side. 
 [Tape ripping] 
 It's just complicated. 
 It's more complicated when you keep it all inside. 
 [Scoffs] You wouldn't understand. 
 But I'm trying to. 
 [Sighs] 
 Good, great. 
 Okay, well, you just... keep doing everything the same, 'cause it seems to really be working out for you. 
 [Scoffs] 
 [Door shuts] 
 [Knocks] 
 Hello! Housekeeping! 
 [Scoffs] 
 [Sighs] 
 [Whispers] sh1t. 
 [Curtain hooks clatter] 
 [Static] 
 [Guns cock] Don't move. 
 You either. 
 [Mexican accent] I didn't expect Odin Rossi to be a woman. 
 That's funny, I expected him to look a lot like you. 
 Something tells me that you have one of these also. 
 Maybe. I just don't show it to just anybody. 
 Move to reading distance? 
 Rafael Cortes? 
 You  federale? 
 Si. Chasing a ghost north of the border: That's a bold move. Fortune favors the bold. I showed you mine. Ah. FBI. Exciting. I cover the Caza Cartel. They sent an assassin here to kill Odin. I suspect you are looking for him also... Ms. DeMarco? Agent DeMarco. Why'd you follow me in here? I was doing surveillance. And finally I see some movement here. Tell me, don't you think we find this hotel room much too easy? I mean, Odin, he not so sloppy. He hasn't given me anything to work with. That makes the two of us. Perhaps... Maybe we can work together. [Speaking Spanish] Get some real results. [Claps hands] Yeah. I have to think about that one. I'm a little protective with my... informacion. I understand. Cautiousness, agent DeMarco. You bugged my grandfather's photo. I trusted you. Did you tell Briggs about our investigation? No. Wanted some answers first. Like, why the bug? Briggs can be very seductive. I was afraid I was losing you to him. I needed to know. Well, what's the verdict? I trust you. You trust Briggs. Why are you so fixated on this case? You've never even met Briggs. Graceland isn't the first house of its kind. It isn't even the first house of its kind for Paul Briggs. He started a house just like Graceland five years ago. It was the prototype. They called it "The Estate." Briggs never mentioned this. I'm sure he didn't. Is this where Briggs lived when he was under with Caza? And just like you, he lived in this house with his training agent. Yeah. Roberto. Is this him? He told you about Roberto? A little bit. Said that Roberto worked the cartel from the Mexican side. Briggs, over here, running sale and distribution in so-Cal. That's right. And I didn't know Briggs. But I did know Roberto from Quantico. He was, uh... he was a close friend of mine. The kind of friend you only make once in a lifetime. [Paper rips] Three years ago: July 2nd. The cartel starts making lots of noise stateside. Jangles. That's right. Roberto and Briggs are under with Caza. The bureau suspects that they're at risk and pull them off the case. Tell Briggs to take a vacation. July 3rd. Briggs claims he went on vacation. July 20th. The house burns down. The agents inside burn with it. Your friend? Five of our best. Gone. The official FBI investigation says it was an electrical fire, accelerated by improperly stored propane. July 25th. Briggs returns from his so-called vacation and finds out that the house has burned down. He acts devastated when he hears about the deaths. They give him some time to sort himself out. Eventually he returns. The FBI starts a new house. Briggs volunteers to be the first one in. And this is the Graceland you live in now. You can't think that Briggs burned down the house. If the FBI called it an accident, if it's-- you know the bureau, Mike-- sometimes it's easier for the FBI to say it's an electrical fire than to admit that five agents were murdered. Why? When they pulled Briggs off the case, he could have lost all the deals he made with Caza. So he gave them something they wanted. You have no proof that ties him to this. The day Briggs got back and saw the house burned... Mm-hmm? Nine hours earlier, there was a phone call made to the main house line from a payphone on the Arizona border. Right. Very few people knew that number. It could have been a wrong number. Yeah, could have been. Except that one minute later another call was made from the same payphone to Lisa: One of the agents in the house. Everyone knew that they were a couple, that they were together. He followed a lead into Mexico. He was captured and tortured. It-- it fits right in your timeline. No, I don't buy it. He lied about these calls. Juan, you're accusing him of murder. But you just listen to me. We can prove all of it. We can prove what really happened. Juan, you're--you're pathologically paranoid. And the sick thing is is that somebody gave you the power to act on it. I am your control officer. [Sighs] And you're gonna help me get Briggs. You're gonna help me prove all of it. No, I'm not. I'm out. Agent Warren. Mike! 
 
 [Knock at door] Mexican man lover. Yo, come on in. Whew! Johnny, what is that? Foot sweat, man? Really needed to do laundry for, like, six weeks now. Oh, yeah? And now that Jakes is out on his job, I can steal his detergent. Oh, yeah. The one that smells like rain. [Singsong] You know it. [Laughs] So, uh, bro, can we talk serious for a minute? Yeah. Is there something up with Charlie? I mean, she's been really cagey with me lately and... Come on, Johnny. Talk to me. I know she's not over whistler. Right. And then the whole stuff that happened with you and her at the C.I.'s house. Yeah, what about it? I don't wanna get in the middle of this thing between you guys. Johnny, that's the whole point. I don't even know what this thing is, man. Help me out. Charlie got this crazy idea that you and Odin are connected somehow. [Guffaws] Me and Odin? I know. Look, I told her it was crazy. Good. Yeah. Wow. Me and Odin? I know, I know. Wow. The secrets in this house, huh? Tell me about it. Unbelievable. So look, man, back to business. [Grunts] I think I wanna focus on Jangles. I know he's in town. But all my leads are dead ends. You got anything? [Scoffs] You know what? I think I might have somebody for you. Word. That's perfect. Let's roll right now. [Car door shuts] I'm not sure this was such a good idea, brah. Well, too late now, Johnny boy. Just, uh, introduce me to the reason why we came. What's up? Hola. [Indistinct chatter, Latin music] Violeta. A vision as always, girly. Johnny T. Long time no see. [Chuckles] Who's the friend? I wouldn't call this guy my friend. You know, I wouldn't either, actually. I'm his brother-in-law. I married his beautiful sister. I didn't know you had a sister, Johnny. Yeah, I do, I do. She's, like, 20 years older than me, so... Good thing love knows no age, my brother. I agree. When it hits you, it hits you. Hey. Mas tequila! I'll be right back. Even joking like that ain't funny, brother. Hey, look, man, you're the one who said you could help me out with my investigation. I didn't know it was gonna involve chasing some skirt. People talk to her. She listens, she knows things. Trust me on this one. And that's the reason why we're here, Johnny? I got it bad for her, man. Every time I see her, it's like scratching an open wound. Why? What's the problem? Violeta don't date bangers. Oh, that's right. You met her when you were under with 18th street, huh? Yeah. She might smile at me a lot, but that's it. [Sighs] If I showed her the badge, I might actually have a shot. Oh, you see? Next time, make your cover LAPD. The reformed banger? Always works. That's brilliant, dude. [Laughs] Now is she gonna come back or what? We got an assassin on the loose. Patience,  hermano. Patience? Oh, you have no idea. Huh. Distinguished service. Look at you. [Indistinct chatter] Hey. So how's the bar been doing lately? Any new faces around here or what? No, mostly just the regulars. New faces get scared away pretty fast. Anybody around here been talking about chopped-off feet? Feet? Yeah. That's all anybody's talking about around my way. I heard a couple guys talking like that, but I thought they were joking. No joke. Bangers : freakin' savages. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Yeah, so, um, who's the one making the jokes? I don't want to get mixed up in no gang sh1t, Johnny. It ain't even like that. Trust me. There is one new face. He's over there in a back booth. Can we get two more, please? She hates me. She does not hate you. Look, I'm gonna go check that out. You just keep talking to her. Two tacos please. [Speaking Spanish] Everything's gonna be okay. All :  Salut. Kung pao beef and crispy duck. Good Chinese food and a good cigar: They bring out the flavor in the other. Hmm, that's a taste I'm gonna have to try to believe. What's the mood out there like? Your men are scared. Good. [Chuckles] Then they will not be overconfident. I don't like seeing the doubt in your eyes, Michael. Caza's not after you. They sent this butcher after Odin. The jolly hombre. Yeah, yeah, the "Key Man." [Laughs] But you just--you-- you won't give up Odin. And now, because of that, this guy's coming after you and coming after your men. I'm disappointed, Michael. I would have thought you, of all people, would understand the necessity of war. I know what's coming. And it's worth it? Yes, it's worth it! My independence from Caza is worth it! Without it, what else am I? You're alive. Alive? Why do you antagonize me? Because... because you do know what's coming. These men... they're gonna die. We  sent a man back to  them...  with a lead-covered... [Bangs table] stump. There's no more talking. There are no more deals. Do you think the lives of my men mean nothing to me? Do you think I take joy from their bloodshed? No. You taught my men how to kill the enemy. Our victory will be nearly as sweet for you as it is for me. [Bottles clink] [Indistinct chatter] What if I told you I was thinking about joining the LAPD? For real? Yeah, for real. Don't tell nobody, though. Okay. [Indistinct chatter] What if he finds out? [Speaks Spanish] That ain't gonna be a problem. Drink, relax. Order's up. Violeta. Con permiso,  I need a moment with my brother. This for me? Yeah. So, look, man. One of Bello's guys is back there selling him out to Caza right now. That means Jangles for sure knows where Bello's safe house is at. [Whispers] sh1t. Oh, we got to tell Mike. Oh, yeah, yeah. For sure, man, I'm all over it. So call the nearest TAC team. I gotta move. Listen to me. You're right, okay? Duck and Smoke: Best partners since, uh... Butch and Sundance. I don't like this, uh, butch and Sundance. Get out of here. No, they are too "quippy," I think is the word. Now, listen, I respect your opinion, but you're-- you're wrong! You're dead wrong. The  Raindrops  song. That's a good song. Where does that belong in a Western? Now, Ennio Morricone: He knew where to put the tension. Uh, yeah, yeah.  Good, Bad, the Ugly, whatever. [Sprinklers whirring] What? The sprinkler's on a timer? I don't know. I think it's probably gonna get some of the other guards. And potentially damage some expensive weapons. Then you better go and turn it off. Hey, Butch and Sundance: best last line ever. "For a moment there, I thought we were in trouble." Think about that. [Phone beeps] [Line ringing] Ah, come on. [Phone beeps off] Damn it. All right, I need backup now. I have multiple casualties. No sign of a shooter. I repeat, I need backup now. [Squeaking] [Sprinklers stop] [Tires screech] [Ignition turns off] [Keys jangling] [Whispers] There's someone with Bello. [Keys jingling] You don't scare me. Men who wear masks are vulnerable. I hear you burned the eyes of your men. Or cut off the hands of my enemies. I prefer the eyes. Knife. [Chuckles] I have far better technique, my friend. Where is Odin Rossi? [Coughing] [Grunts] You think I will help you? [Scoffs] [Shoe squeaks] Michael, kill him! Shoot the b*st*rd! [Gunshots] Bello! Get the hell out of here! [Gunshots, glass shatters] [Gun clicks] Hyuh! [Groans] [Gunshot, glass shatters] [Groans] Oh, God. [Whispers] Mike. Mike, I got you, buddy. [Sighs] My God. Did I get him? [Weakly] I think so. Go on, find him. Go. Next time, Mikey, next time. [Guns cocking] Move your hand, move your hand. [Groaning] Right there, right there. Ooh! Hold that there. [Indistinct chatter] Enter. Hey, guys, take care of him. Call the EMT. Right, I'm on it. There's a wagon in front of you guys. Right through here. Subject one and two in custody. Hey. Hey, read me my rights. What? Read me my rights. You have the right to remain silent. Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law. If you have an attorney... or can't afford one, one will be appointed to you. Michael? Michael? Do you understand your rights? Let's go. [Siren wails] [Edgy rock music] ♪ [Siren] [Deep breathing] [Echoing heartbeat, EKG beeping] [Echoing] Hey. [Monitor beeping steadily] [Normal voice] There's those blue eyes. [Groans] Here, here. Uhh. [Sighs] The doctor says you're gonna survive. It's gonna take some time, but you'll get there. Hope I didn't miss breakfast. [Laughs] It's 5:00 P.M. You're missing happy hour. I assume the bear's from Johnny? [Guffaws] Good guess. He told me to tell you not to shoot it. Gifts and stuff, they're-- they're all from you guys? There's nothing there from, um... the FBI or, you know... anonymous? Um... I... I don't know. [Sighs] What's going on? Mike, talk to me. [Exhales] We all lie for the job, but... you guys, you can-- you can walk into Graceland and relax and be yourself. I can't. Why? Because I was placed in Graceland to investigate Briggs. And now this whole thing is-- [exhales] Is just out of control and-- You're a rat? What? No. A rat? No, I'm not a rat. That's not what I'm saying. [Stammers] I don't even know what to say. You don't have to say anything. Um, I just have to tell somebody. Somebody that I can trust. You need--you need to get your rest. No, Paige... You need to get your rest. It's just now--no. Paige, I'm just trying to tell you the truth here. I can't be here right now. Paige, wait, please, just... [Over headset] On the Jangles front. I still don't even really know what the guy looks like. Every time I saw him, he had a bandanna on his face. Of course, he always had those damn rattling keys. But, uh, yeah, that's still all I got to go on. Why? Bello's getting nervous. Oh, he is. Very, very... [Keys jingling] You got my message. [Softly] Yes. I was--I was very happy to receive it. You want? Please. It's very good. Ahh. So how about you taking down Bello, huh? You heard already. Of course. I wouldn't be good at my job if I didn't. You should be proud. We are. What's the news on your side? The word is that, uh, Caza is calling Jangles back to Mexico. Really? Yeah, but this word doesn't stick. This man Jangles, he's like... he's like an attack dog. And he has Odin's scent. I guarantee he's still around. Good to know. I mean, at least we have Bello in FBI custody. I could at least work Odin's location out of him. I got skills Jangles doesn't. Hey, um, ah, maybe we should put all this, uh, agency bullshit behind us. I-I think we can. You do? I mean, we could actually help each other. Takin' down Caza, Jangles... Odin. Uh, it's a beautiful relationship. Mi informacion es su informacion. Salud. Cheers. Test, test. This is agent Juan Badillo. [Keys jingling] I am about to approach agent Paul Briggs regarding his role in the deaths of five agents in the safe house fire. [Keys jingling] I am undercover as the Caza mercenary... known as Jangles. [Car door shuts] [Sobs] [Slaps ground] [Keys jingling] [Keys jingling] [Laughs] Yeah! [Keys jingling] Hey. You know what this place is? [Spanish accent] I know exactly what this place is. You killed everyone here. You know what? You're right. We both did. [Keys jingling] This place burned because of us. Well, everyone has his price, right? You know, I never thought I would find mine at the end of a needle. But you made sure of that, didn't you? Didn't you! And you lit the match! Stay back. Guns now? Fine. [Grunting, keys jingling] [Gunshot]
