 Previously on Graceland...  
 Please, you help me! 
 How many times do I need to explain this to you? 
 They're not yours. I'm taking Lina. 
 We go? 
 What do you mean "go"? 
 Look at me! 
 Aah! 
 Hey, hey. Okay. 
 What happened to Lina? 
 She ran. 
 You're telling me that she overpowered you? 
 I wasn't ready. 
 You said I need four people to take a bank. 
 How about, hypothetically, you and me take it? 
 Safe-deposit box is a little more complicated. 
 Blow those the wrong way, you're gonna lose the contents. 
 Looks like it's coming along. 
 Turn around, okay? The feds are gonna hit the garage. 
 What? 
 [Tires squealing] 
 I know you're working with the Solano cartel. 
 You going undercover at the police station is nuts. 
 We work with them, Paul. 
 Slick work out there today. 
 Oh, thanks. 
 Hope I didn't step on your toes. 
 You kidding me? The job got done. 
 That's what matters. 
 Let's go grab a beer, yeah? 
 Yeah. 
 This is Agent Juan Badillo. 
 I am about to approach Agent Paul Briggs. 
 [Gunshot] 
 I have guns and drugs in basements by the ton. 
 I have a friend who works in international aid. 
 They load everything into these crates, fly it up in a plane, and shove it out the back. 
 I can run the entire operation without him. 
 You have the means? 
 Papa, I am your son. 
 Two weeks, my friend can have a flight plan mapped out. 
 Tell me the details.

 There. 
 Johnny tells me you need 6 tons of product a day, every day. 
 I can deliver. 
 No, that's... that's impossible. 
 You see, the F.A.A., the Border Patrol, they have this little thing called radar, and you put a pallet that size out there, it's gonna pop on their screens, you know. 
 No, it won't, actually. Tell them the best part. 
 Best part... I got a tract of land with a coverage hole, right in between the F.A.A. and the B.P.'s radar detection. 
 Pallets drop right in that sweet spot.

 [Plane roars overhead] 
 Plane's coming. 
 Now, gentlemen, for this demonstration, we'll be using flour to simulate your product. 
 Keep in mind this is a major delivery system here, all right? 
 It's not like you dropping trash bags of weed out of a Cessna. 
 Uh, sir, when we're up and running, you should come north and see it. 
 No, Johnny, my father... he doesn't go to the U.S. 
 Perhaps, for this, I'll make an exception.

 You've wasted a great deal of my time. 
 Okay. 
 We can have the cruise ships ready in ten days, papa,  but I might need some help from our policeman. 
 Markham? Maybe I'll call him.

 Lunch run... fried chicken again. 
 Want me to bring you something from home? 
 You could use a shave. 
 No, I'm fine. How you holding up? 
 It's been two weeks and nothing. 
 She's gone. 
 Well, wherever she is, it's better than in there. 
 I got to go. 
 Mike, Mexico didn't go so well. 
 [Sighs] How bad? 
 Solano's not going with the plane. 
 God damn it. 
 We're so close to this. 
 Just say the word. We can end this now. 
 No. 
 Mike. 
 No, if the plane didn't work, this is the only connection to Solano I've got. 
 We just have to hold out. 
 Yeah. All right. 
 Enjoy your chicken. 
 [Engine turning over] 
 And then this guy comes out. 
 This dumb-ass, fob, wannabe kkangpae killer comes out with a pair of nunchakus. 
 Bullshit. 
 Nunchakus. 
 Nunchakus? 
 I sh1t you not. 
 Come on. 
 He was swinging that sh1t around like Bruce Lee. 
 It was absolutely insane. 
 [Laughter] 
 I don't... I have no idea... 
 Crazy, man. 
 West? 
 Yeah. 
 Just give us a second. 
 What's up? 
 Just some old business. Clear out. 
 Yes, sir. If you need me... 
 Yeah, I you know where to find you. 
 So Solano just called about some cruise ships in Mexico. 
 [Footsteps approaching] 
 Charlie, is that you? 
 It's just me. Sorry. 
 It's all right. 
 Make any headway with your missing girl? 
 Uh, I've canvassed Pacoima, Santa Clarita, San Fernando, and Mission Hills. 
 I've hung posters in bus stops, truck stops, and a community-college ride-share program. 
 I have dogs in the national forest and birds over Pico Canyon. 
 So, if by "making headway" you mean I've eliminated pretty much anywhere that a malnourished, penniless, scared-as-hell, illegal immigrant could go without anybody noticing her, then, yeah, I've made tremendous headway. 
 Well, you know, pretty girl, desperate, middle of the night, think somebody picked her up? 
 No, I don't. 
 Mike had three cuts, one on his forehead, one on his temple, and one on his palm. 
 One hit of a tire iron, three cuts. 
 What exactly are you suggesting? 
 I'm not suggesting anything exactly. 
 Right. 
 Look, Paige, we all know the kid's got a hard-on for the case, but I'm not sure murder is in his wheelhouse. 
 What about cover-up, to keep Sulla operational? 
 You're with tactical, right? Send 'em in. 
 His cover team is FBI, so they're not gonna make a move without his green light. 
 I can make some calls at the Bureau. 
 I'm not asking you to make calls, Briggs. 
 I am asking you to help me shut Sulla down. 
 I can't hit the compound. 
 You can supersede his orders. 
 I can't hit the compound...   but I think I know someone who can. 
 What does that mean? 
 As close as I've gotten to Sid, he's still keeping me on the wrong side of the door, you know. 
 It might be you just handed me the key. 
 [Electronic music] 
 Two weeks I don't hear from you, and now secret meetings? 
 You have to go, from Mexico. 
 What do you mean? Why? 
 You lost my father's favor, Johnny. 
 My brother gets the business running, he'll put you in the ground. 
 I can't. 
 Look, baby, I just need to do this once, okay? 
 Then I'm done. 
 We can start over. 
 Are you that desperate for money? 
 You're so greedy that you would risk your life? 
 I don't have a choice. 
 Hey. 
 What'd she want? 
 Nothing. To save my life. 
 You'd think after some point, she'd stop giving it up to these Mexican gangsters, you know what I mean? 
 Guess these idiots never learn. 
 Mm-hmm. 
 Uh, Lucia didn't choose her father, man. 
 She definitely didn't choose her crazy-ass brother, but she did choose me, and I'm lying to her and... 
 Son, are you pissing in these buckets? 
 We don't got a proper toilet in here. 
 Where you want me to piss? 
 That's gross! 
 Where would you like me to piss, Johnny? 
 You're frickin' gross, dude. 
 Anyway, I can't make this math work. 
 It's too much weight to give a soft landing. 
 I can strengthen the lines, but it'll still land hard. 
 I could add three or four more chutes, but then they're gonna tangle into each other. 
 Yeah, well, you'll figure something out. 
 Thank you. Very helpful. 
 Hey, you mind, um, taking one of them buckets out? 
 Absolutely not. 
 [Siren wails] 
 Hey. Check out Wild West. 
 Who's the pair of heels? 
 I don't know. She looks like a fed. 
 What's her agency? 
 The smoking-hot agency. 
 Whoever she is, she's stealing our stuff. 
 [Clears throat] West, you got the authorization to give away department property? 
 Uh, hey, boss. 
 Actually, I was just telling her that she'd need authorization from someone a little higher on the food chain. 
 As you're handing it over to her? 
 [Laughs] 
 Sid Markham. 
 Karen Bradford, FBI. 
 Bureau's going through some cutbacks? 
 No, no, we're actually doing long-term surveillance out in the valley, and I just got word that our comm system shorted. 
 So, instead of doubling back, I thought... 
 She was looking to find a good samaritan. 
 Did I? 
 Bring 'em back whole. 
 Call us first if you need some heads busted. 
 Done. 
 Got it? 
 Thank you. 
 Yeah. 
 Stay out of trouble, boys. 
 Will do. 
 [Scoffs] 
 What's she working on? 
 She took a phone call. 
 I didn't hear much, but there were cartel ties. 
 Hmm. Which cartel? 
 Solano. 
 West, you got plenty of years under the belt. 
 I'm sure you've seen how this plays out. 
 How what plays out? 
 Feds. 
 They got their own agenda. 
 I'm not sure I follow you. 
 This task force... we have a handful of cases linked to the Solanos, cases that we've worked for a long time. 
 I don't want to see that work undone. 
 Uh, boss, no disrespect, but you can either treat me like a toddler or tell me what the hell's going on here, because I'm lost. 
 Uh, you and little miss FBI had some chemistry. 
 I'd like you to lean in, see what she's doing with our surveillance gear. 
 Oh. 
 Yeah. Yeah, can do. 
 Good. 
 All right. 
 Later. 
 Ready? 
 Go. 
 Ugh! 
 What the sh1t, Charlie? 
 Let's run it again. 
 No! Your explosion is too big. 
 We're refining. 
 Well, you're gonna have to rig half of these boxes yourself. 
 You're burning the sh1t up, and they're too loud. 
 Somebody hears, you missed your chance. 
 All right, that's enough. 
 I got a week. I'll get it, all right? 
 My wife. 
 She's beautiful. 
 [Laughing] My God, we were young then. 
 [Chuckles] 
 The horse was a wedding gift. 
 The children were still children when she passed... pancreatic cancer. 
 She fought for 2 1/2 years, which, if you don't know, is quite impressive. 
 I mean, there's no way she raised those kids without being a strong woman. 
 You know what I learned from her in those last few months? 
 We have very little time and none to waste. 
 Sir, look, I'm sorry. The last thing I want to do is waste your time. 
 You already have. 
 If we fix the measurements on the crates... 
 Listen, enough. 
 Carlito is on the coast preparing the ships. 
 When he returns, he wants you to join us for a meal to bury the hatchet, as it were. 
 And then you will go away.

 I'm just checking on that plane, you know. 
 You work that Johnny charm on Senior yet? 
 No, okay, look, can everybody just give me some goddamn time, please? 
 What's holding you back? 
 Senior's locked in on Carlito and his dumb-ass cruise-ship idea. 
 Uh-huh. How's Jakes coming on the parachute fix? 
 Hopefully he comes up with something before Carlito kills me.

 Solano's had his hands in a lot of pots, but it's never been girls. 
 Hmm. Well, it's definitely Solano. 
 His son set it up.

 Dude, it was crazy. 
 I'm talking bout, like, Floyd Mayweather-level beatdown. 
 I almost feel bad for Carlito. 
 And he just flipped his lid, no reason? 
 He didn't even say anything. That's the crazy part. 
 Wonder if it's the limp-wrist thing? 
 Nah, he's been looking the other way for years on that. 
 Hmm. 
 This was something bigger. 
 Maybe something went wrong with the cruise ships. 
 What does it matter? 
 I mean, we got our second chance. 
 I mean, if we can make this work, which I don't even know... what do you mean you don't know? 
 I don't know, Johnny... that's why we need to find out why Solano's all of a sudden busting skulls, you get it?

 No. I can convince your father. 
 No, my father does not forgive betrayal. 
 How'd you betray him? 
 He doesn't see women as a commodity. 
 We differ on that front. 
 But you see, Johnny, the Solanos... we do not forgive, and we do not... forget. 
 Okay. 
 Yo, I wasn't sure if you were still under with Sulla or not. 
 Yeah, I needed a breather. Why? 
 Hey, I just got it confirmed from Carlito. 
 We're getting a second test run with the plane because Senior found out about the girls. 
 Wait. What did you just say? 
 Apparently dad knows about Sylmar and does not approve. 
 Thanks.

 God damn it. 
 Carlos Solano just found out about the girls. 
 How did you... I mean... what does that mean? 
 It means that Sulla's living on borrowed time.

 You're kind of a son of a bitch, huh? 
 [Sighs] There was nothing I could do, Mike. 
 Right. How'd Sid find out about Sulla? 
 Man, you got me. 
 But once he got the tip, he wasted no time putting everything into motion, that's for sure. 
 It was better to swing with the pendulum than resist it. 
 Couldn't find any way to warn me? 
 How? By the time I knew what was happening, I was standing right next to Sid, literally, you know, pole position. 
 I mean, send me a text, give me a call, call Paige. 
 No, Mike, I couldn't. 
 I was busy earning the guy's trust. 
 That's what you assigned me to do, remember? 
 So you guys screwed me, huh? 
 We lost everything. 
 You're not hearing me, brother. 
 Sid is finally bringing me into the fold. 
 That's what you always wanted, remember? 
 We gained everything, Mike. 
 I mean, I made myself an MVP to the guy today. 
 Damn near confessed everything to me. 
 You're in. 
 I am all the way in. 
 Well, the guy mowed down seven people right in front of us, and we can't do anything, so he's got to act again. 
 Yeah, hey, once he realizes his retirement plan has disappeared from those safe-deposit boxes, he will, and your boy's going to be standing right next to him when he makes his move, okay? 
 Right. 
 Johnny. 
 Look, babe, I got to go. 
 I got to go. 
 Look, Johnny, stop. 
 Listen to me. I know you're going to meet my father. 
 Listen, for years, I felt like this is my family, my blood. 
 I had an obligation to love them. 
 They have no love, not even for themselves. 
 Your father loves you. 
 My father will love me until I threaten him, and then it will be me with the broken face. 
 Listen... 
 You said, "one time." 
 Did you mean it? 
 Yes, once, and then I'm out. 
 If you're lying to me, you're gonna have a third Solano to worry about. 
 I'm not lying to you. 
 All right. 
 After this is done, we take the money, and we get out of here, for good. 
 Okay. Yeah. 
 Go show my father your plane and come back to me. 
 We have a lot to talk about. 
 Same amount of product as before? 
 To the ounce. 
 But we've added an extra feature, so just keep your eye on it. 
 It's clever. 
 Inflatable raft with a ripcord. 
 When the chute deploys, the raft inflates. 
 Go home, make the necessary arrangements. 
 In one week's time, we begin the shipments. 
 Thank you, sir. We'll be ready. 
 Señor Solano, I... I think I should stay in Mexico until we're up and running. 
 Your business is north now. 
 No, Dale can handle the drop zone. 
 I want to stay. 
 Johnny, I don't usually give second chances. 
 Go home. 
 What the hell was that? 
 You fall in love with the homeland? 
 [Engine turning over] 
 I told her I'd be back. 
 You told Lucia you'd be back? 
 I thought you said it yourself... 
 It's not that simple! 
 Hey... Johnny, it is that simple. 
 You do your frickin' job, man! 
 I am doing my job. 
 You do yours. 
 Don't... don't even... don't do that. 
 Don't do it. 
 Do what you want to do. 
 [Sniffles] 
 Sauce, huh? 
 Been too long. 
 Way too long. 
 You want to hear the story? 
 I know the story. 
 [Chuckles] 
 Jakes called. Him and Johnny are coming home. 
 Oh. When? 
 Now. 
 Mike and Paige are done at Sylmar, so I just thought... 
 You know, Graceland used to be a safe haven, you know... for all of us. 
 I don't know when, but we lost that. 
 Well, you know, it doesn't have to stay that way. 
 Yeah. 
 Charlie, baby, turn around. Look at me. 
 Listen, um... 
 I want you to know that if it... if it was gonna be anybody, it would be you. 
 I really want to keep it. 
 [Chuckles] 
 [Laughs] 
 You want to help me cut the peppers? 
 Yes, I do. 
 [Cell phone ringing] 
 Test, test. 
 This is Agent Juan Badillo. 
 I am about to approach Agent Paul Briggs regarding his role in the deaths of five agents in the safe-house fire. 
 I am undercover as the Caza Mercenary known as Jangles.
