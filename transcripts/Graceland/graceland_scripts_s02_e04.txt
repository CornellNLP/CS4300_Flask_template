 Previously on  Graceland... 
 For the last few months, I've been investigating a theory... buses. 
 Smuggling contraband in passenger buses... and the FBI has given me a team to prove it. 
 You guys will be working for me. 
 This whole case hinges on Carlito Solano. 
 What's your name? 
 Johnny. 
 I just want visitation, Cassandra. 
 We can tal... 
 Excuse me, Mr. Jakes. 
 Step back, please. 
 Okay. 
 We've got a restraining order, Mr. Jakes. 
 Okay, all right! All right! 
 Who's that man? 
 I'm your father! 
 What happened? I thought you were going to go live with your kid or something. 
 [Grunts] Oh! 
 Someone's responsible for making her a widow and making that kid fatherless. 
 She's drinking again. 
 I think I know you. Name's Kelly. 
 I don't remember you from meetings. 
 I pretty much keep to myself. 
 Took me a long time to open up. 
 Yeah, about your husband. 
 So you got nothing. 
 Nothing bus-related. 
 I could show you the tinker bells. 
 That is a different girl, with the same... 
 Same backpack. 
 Look, it's tinker bell. 
 "Sylmar." What is in Sylmar? 
 He says go! 
 I need you to take this, and I will find you. 
 I promise. 
 Bus 118 drops all its passengers off and ends up here. 
 Hey, where's Paige? 
 Sylmar. 
 [Cell phone vibrates] 
 [Soul music] 
 ♪ 
 All right, hand me the open-ended half-inch. 
 Thank you. 
 All right. Give it a shot. 
 [Engine turns] 
 Like a kitten. 
 How did I not know that you were actually a master mechanic? 
 'Cause when people find out, they make me fix their cars. 
 Well, it's a good thing I chose you over Zelanski, 'cause there's going to be a lot of bus-related questions. 
 Am I ready. 
 You can shift into all gears, but you hear a clunk when you drop it into reverse. 
 [As Howard Payne from  speed] What do you do, hot shot? 
 What do you do? 
 You replace the shift rod grommet, 'cause that bitch is missing. 
 Yeah! 
 How about your cover? 
 Uh-huh. 
 You memorize the Jenkins resume? 
 Ugh! I have done this before, boss man. 
 Just making sure. 
 This is our one way into that bus garage. 
 What title did you hold at greyhound from 2002 to 2005? 
 Mr. congeniality? 
 I'll study tonight. 
 Hey, one more thing to remember about the buses. 
 Mm-hmm. 
 The wheels go round and round. 
 Mm-hmm. Thank you. 
 [Kisses] 
 Relax. 
 Yo, Charlie, why do you waste your money on this stuff? 
 'Cause I like to know who wore it better. 
 You got letters from, like, four different lawyers, man. 
 You heard of privacy? 
 Is this your contingency plan? 
 This is the plan... figuring out how to rip one of these apart. 
 I mean, border patrol, they miss a lot, but they're not idiots. 
 If the Solanos are hauling tonnage in a commuter line, they're not going to be jamming their product into the luggage compartments with the carry-ons. 
 They built it in. 
 Mm. 
 So we're going to rip one open, and then we're going to have proof. 
 Anything actionable in that girl's letter? 
 Girl's name is lina, and she's writing about dancing and sending money home. 
 Nothing about the Solano cartel? 
 No, Mike. She was scared and lonely, and she wrote a personal letter home to her family. 
 [Sighs] I'm sorry. 
 I'm starting to think that Jakes was right. 
 I don't think lina was just a mule. 
 You said that she swallowed drug balloons. 
 She did, but the guys that recruited her were looking for models and dancers. 
 Pretty is not a prerequisite for muling. 
 s*x trade? 
 Look, I don't have much to go on, but if you can give me a team, I can go up to Sylmar, I can kick some doors in. 
 If we're lucky, maybe we find her. 
 Maybe we find the tinker bells, okay? 
 Or at least somebody who knows where they are. 
 Connect this thing to Solano. 
 Go kick down some doors. 
 Thank you. 
 [Giggles] 
 Sorry, Mr. Jakes. 
 There's really nothing we can do. 
 I'm never going to see my son again. 
 Is that what you're telling me? 
 It'll be difficult, considering your behavior. 
 My behavior? 
 I quit my job for him, okay? 
 I got a new apartment for him. 
 Is that the behavior you're talking about? 
 'Cause now I'm a little confused. 
 Look, sorry, there's really nothing I can do. 
 I'll send you a list of colleagues who might be able to help, okay? 
 How's that? Good-bye. Thank you.

 ♪ 
 You know, I think after listening to the same stories over and over again for six months, these things, they should turn solid gold. 
 To one meeting at a time. 
 Oh, yes. 
 [Chuckles] 
 You look good. New job? 
 [Laughs] Receptionist, just part-time. 
 That's something. 
 Something. I miss my law firm. 
 What happened to it? 
 Ten years sober, Juan dies or whatever, I get drunk... [Laughs] 
 And suddenly I'm scraping bottom. 
 Well, didn't your husband work for, like, the FBI or something like that? 
 I'd think with a job like that, he'd have pretty good life insurance, no? 
 I mean, he did, or he does. 
 It's just he's not officially gone, so I don't get any money. 
 Officially gone? What does that mean? 
 Well, they believe that Juan was murdered by some Mexican psychopath, and they never found his body, so the FBI won't pay his death benefits. 
 That's bullshit, man. 
 It is. 
 It's $230,000 worth of bullshit. 
 There's nothing you can do? 
 No. 
 I mean, sometimes I wonder if he's still alive, and maybe he ran off with another woman. 
 No, don't, don't. 
 All they found was his key. 
 It was on the psychopath's key chain, so... 
 Wherever Juan is, I guess he's locked out. 
 [Crow cawing] 
 [Tense music] 
 [Distorted speech] 
 [Laughter] 
 [Distorted voices] 
 That's new. 
 What? 
 You were gasping. 
 Did something happen with Kelly last night? 
 No. 
 No, we just chatted for a little bit after the meeting. 
 She still hasn't received Juan's death benefits. 
 What? 
 Yeah. 
 [Scoffs] 
 She's owed a couple hundred grand, but, uh, bureau hasn't found a body, and so they ain't kicking out. 
 Goddamn penny-pinching FBI. 
 We said we'd do something for her. 
 Let's get her what she's owed. 
 Come on, Chuck, how are we gonna do that? 
 [Retching] 
 [Groans] 
 [Retching] 
 All right, yeah, nothing to see here, guys. 
 Ride that porcelain highway all the way to the last exit, my brother. 
 Here, baby, wipe your mouth. 
 Thanks. [Clears throat] 
 Need me to hold back your dreads or something? 
 [Toilet flushes] [Coughs] 
 D.J., my man, what is up? Talk to me, bro. 
 I'm forced to realize that life sucks, everything hurts, and nothing is good. 
 Anything you need from me? 
 Yeah. Mike. Can you just... 
 I don't want him to see me like this, man. 
 Oh, yeah, I'll run some "d" for you. 
 Anybody seen Jakes? 
 Uh, just the man I wanted to see. Mike. 
 [Coughing] 
 Uh, I wanted to talk to you about the chore wheel, and it's been the same... 
 What is this? 
 Oh, nothing. He just had a bad taco from Hector's. 
 [Laughs] 
 Um... 
 I can't believe you're doing this. 
 Warren, cut him some slack, man. 
 I mean, look, this is not our Dale Jakes. 
 He's going through some sh1t. 
 Look, we all go through sh1t, all right, but we don't all end up wrapped around a toilet seat 30 minutes before an op. I feel good, though, Mike. 
 I got... [Sniffles] I got the devil out. 
 I feel good now. See? 
 You know what, why don't I tag along today just to play buffer between you two, maintain operational integrity? 
 Get him in the shower. 
 Suit up. 
 Yeah. 
 Look at this. Our team in hermosillo just caught fire from the Caza cartel, and I'm already taking heat on this because Warren found nothing on those damn buses. 
 He's close. 
 Close? 
 We're collecting injuries, and I'm pulling the plug. 
 Give him till the end of the week. 
 [Laughs] 
 You realize that we've already gone out on a limb on this twice. 
 Put Mike under me. I'll run the op. 
 Okay. But if it goes bad... 
 Then I'll take the hit. 
 Yes, you will. 
 [Door opens] 
 Birmingham greyhound depot, huh? 
 Yes, sir. Good music, better barbecue. 
 [Laughs] 
 But I moved back here, so... 
 I mean, you can go ahead and call my references. 
 I'm not worried about your skills. 
 Hmm. 
 I am worried about the warning signs. 
 Warning signs? 
 Tried to mask it, but I'm a bloodhound when it comes to whiskey. 
 Can't stop it from seeping out of your pores. 
 What? You told me to get him in the shower, not scrub his taint. 
 I had a couple last night, but... 
 You know, scotch isn't illegal. 
 Yeah, I remember those days. 
 The life I wanted was right here, but I was burning rubber in the exact and opposite direction, and you know how I fixed it? 
 Asked Siri? 
 I got clean. Not a drop since 1998. 
 Wow. Congratulations. 
 [Sighs] I don't need a parade. 
 I did what was necessary for me. 
 Look, I had one bad night last night, okay? 
 This is not gonna be a regular thing, I can assure you. 
 I am sure you're a decent enough mechanic, but I need guys I can rely on. 
 Yeah. I'm that guy. 
 No, you're not, not yet. 
 I should have went with Zelanski. 
 You know what your problem is, Warren? 
 What's that? 
 You've got no loyalty. 
 I think I just got bent over by loyalty. 
 D.J., listen, man. 
 [Inaudible dialogue] 
 What was that? 
 You said you need hands on that bus. 
 Jakes is the guy who can get it done. 
 What'd you give him? 
 Loyalty. 
 Look, I said we're done. 
 Six months. 
 This is the most time I could ever get. 
 I swear to God, man, I'm trying, but I don't got a blueprint. 
 You still going to meetings? 
 Yeah, all the time. 
 You know how it is, you get some shitty news, and... 
 Back at square one with a glass in my hand. 
 Yeah, well, you need to find the right environment. 
 I know. That's why I came back. 
 I need the structure, and... listen, I know I can do the work. 
 I'm not hiring a project here. I'm hiring an employee. 
 But I know you understand. 
 Someone gave you a second chance, right? 
 [Sighs] 
 You can start tomorrow? 
 Absolutely. 
 I'll be here, rested... Yes! 
 And ready to start at 8:00 A.M. 
 Thank God for savior complexes. 
 Mm! 
 Hey, sweet thing. 
 Hey. 
 You going back to the parlor? 
 Mike wants me to see if there's any street chatter about Paige's girls and Solano. 
 Plus I was hoping maybe I could catch something that could help us. 
 What are you talking about, huh? 
 I talked to the FBI today and pretended to be one of Kelly's lawyers. 
 And? 
 And I said that Jangles is a serial killer, he had Juan's key on his key ring... give her the goddamn money! 
 How'd that go for you? 
 Not good. 
 They're not going to give her sh1t, so we have to get it for her. 
 What are you talking about, Chuck? 
 What do we have to do? We going to rob a bank? 
 We don't have to do anything.  I  have to do something. 
 This is really, really impressive. 
 Like, cirque du soleil-level bendiness. 
 Shouldn't he have given us the takedown by now? 
 He's just doing a really thorough job of making sure it's a brothel. 
 Oh, she's dope. 
 Can I mix and match, like at 31 flavors? 
 Just say it, Johnny. 
 Those all the options? 
 No one hiding in the back or anything? 
 Well, then, I really hate to ask this, more than you know, but do you take American express? 
 That's it, go. Go, go, go! 
 Come on, look, I thought it was a teahouse! 
 Look, I just wanted to get some oolong, I swear to God! 
 Damn! 
 You're under arrest for the solicitation of prostitution and operating a house of ill fame. 
 My girls are hostesses, nothing more! 
 Mm-hmm, good luck proving that. 
 I'm about to make your life a living hell, unless you cooperate. Cooperate? 
 Tell me about the pink backpacks. 
 Backpacks? What are you talking about? 
 The eastern European girls that come in from Mexico and get dropped off here in Sylmar. 
 Talk to my lawyer. 
 Get in. 
 Don't let her take me. Don't let her take... ow, okay. She's involved. 
 You sure? 
 She knows something, and she just lawyered up. 
 All right, so find yourself a loophole, P. 
 Come on, get your girl. 
 Still thinking about how your crazy ass ended up all bloody the other day. 
 I got a feeling you like walking on the wild side. 
 Friday night, me and the boys are hitting up some clubs. 
 My place. 
 [Grunts] Mm! 
 So I guess Carlito liked the pistols I got him. 
 Hmm. 
 I was thinking maybe we could stick with the same theme, you know, like, amaze him with a bottle of that Tequila that we got. 
 What you think? Yeah? No? 
 Listen, man, I'm glad you're heading into this thing full throttle, but lest we forget, that guy shot his own man in the neck for fun. 
 So you're saying be careful? 
 I'm saying, why stand out when you can blend in? 
 You've already shown him Johnny the amazing. 
 Maybe now it's time to fall back a little bit, just be one of the posse. 
 [Tattoo machines buzzing] 
 You're making sure her eyes are haunting, right? 
 Most hauntingest eyes you've ever seen. 
 [Hip-hop music playing] 
 Yo, Larezo, you ready? 
 Char, do you know where the transfer paper ended up? 
 Larezo wants another dagger. 
 To match the one I did before? 
 Yeah. 
 Above the sink. 
 Mm-hmm. 
 Hey, you know larezo? 
 I might. 
 He's, like, the king of the West Side. 
 You think you might be able to introduce me? 
 Why do you want to meet him? 
 Professional interest. 
 You a junkie? 
 [Laughs] No. 
 No, flipped that coin. 
 Yeah, I don't know. 
 I mean, are you going to waste his time? 
 He ain't into that sh1t. 
 No, I'm legit. 
 I just inherited a stable of horses. 
 I'm just looking for some good homes. 
 Hey, um... 
 How much "h" we talking about? 
 [Laughs] Plenty. 
 Plenty, plenty. 
 Boss, you got a second? 
 [Sighs] 
 Walk with me, talk with me. 
 Well, I just want to let you know, um, if you ever need any extra help, I'm always willing. 
 Keep your pants on, Jenkins. You just got here. 
 My belt's buckled. 
 Just, you know, if there's any overtime opportunities or anything, you know, I'm your man. 
 You need the dough, or you just trying to stay too busy not to land up in a bar? 
 I do like that overtime pay, I can't lie. 
 You know, just trying to get back up to zero. 
 Okay, I'll tell you what. 
 You show me some more stability, and we'll talk about the extra green. 
 Thank you. 
 118. 
 118's our magic number. 
 Every other bus flows in, out, no problem. 
 118 gets in bay five, full lockdown. 
 One bus, one bay. 
 Ah, that makes our job a whole lot easier. 
 So what's our next move? 
 Next move is we get 118 alone, give my guys 20 minutes, they tear that thing bolt from bolt. 
 Find out how they're hiding the product, plant some trackers, and trace that thing all the way back to the cartel. 
 Follow the drugs to the money, the money to Solano. 
 Exactly. 
 What kind of security they got on that bay? 
 It's like a fob key card thing. 
 You think you could get close enough to Lawrence to make a mirror of his key card? 
 Give me the technology, I'll make it happen. 
 Make it happen by tomorrow? 
 Don't you worry your pretty little blond head. 
 Where is my lawyer? 
 In homeland security threats, they don't get lawyers right away. 
 We get to take our time. 
 We took a look at the computer at your office. 
 Turns out you've been corresponding with a suspected Xinjiang separatist. 
 These are emails to a nurse taking care of my parents. 
 On the surface, or it could be instructions to a violent extremist. 
 It's really hard to tell. 
 So what you need to understand is I don't give a sh1t about you or your business, but I will destroy you if you don't give me what I need. 
 Full immunity. 
 Okay, what happens to the eastern European girls? 
 A blond girl knocked at my door a year ago looking for a gig, real scared. 
 Said she rode up from Mexico, but her accent was Russian. 
 They dropped her into some facility, and she was auctioned off. 
 She escaped? 
 From the buyer. 
 He had scarred up the side of her face pretty bad, so I couldn't use her. 
 So you just turned her out onto the street? 
 That's everything I know.

 A way to get Kelly her money, an actual check to her from the FBI. 
 [Sighs] Charlie... 
 Paul, I was inking a guy today... Gibson. 
 He sat right there in my chair and told me he had a sh1t ton of heroin burning a hole in his garage, and he wants to turn it to cash asap. 
 Come on. 
 Who's working him? 
 No one. 
 FBI and DEA don't even know he exists.

 230k on the head. Let me guess. 
 Your informant's name is Kelly Badillo.

 Charlie, I don't have to tell you, you file this, it's a major felony. 
 And who's going to know? 
 Paul, don't rack your brain. 
 I'm not asking you to get involved. 
 Well, first of all, you know I'd never let you do something like this on your own. 
 And second of all, I want to get her the money as bad as you do, but this is high risk, Chuck. 
 I can't have this weighing on my shoulders anymore. 
 I can't keep trying to fix everything that I broke.

 [Grunts] 
 Hey, hey, I'll cut, you dump, all right? 
 Gibson? On the floor with a headache. 
 Miss drug cases? 
 [Gunshot] 
 What'd you do to him? 
 Think the team heard that? 
 What'd you do to him? 
 Your boyfriend's going to be fine, okay, but you won't be if you don't put that gun down. 
 You're stealing our whole nest egg. 
 I'm not stealing anything. My boss is. 
 Maybe you've heard of him. Larezo? 
 Now, larezo gets irritated when people shoot at his employees. 
 Let's not irritate larezo, huh? 
 [Crash] FBI, nobody move! 
 Hands in the air! 
 We're not done yet. 
 Close enough. 
 Put 'em up! 
 Where we can see 'em. 
 Lemon squeezy. 
 [Chuckles] 
 What you doing? 
 I'm gluing the check to the letter. 
 You made sure to use the phrase "one-time payment," right? 
 Bureau considers existing evidence sufficient, investigation is concluded, and death benefits enclosed. 
 Way to go, Clyde. 
 [Laughing] See you, dude. 
 Checkered flag is waving. 
 Let's ice them. 
 You assholes came through here four months ago and checked everybody's papers! 
 Well, a lot could happen in four months. 
 Oh, yeah? 
 Nobody leaves this area until I've cleared each person, okay? 
 Yo. 
 No one saw you sneak away? 
 Do I like people drinking my O.J.? 
 No, you do not. 
 My I.C.E. guys will only be able to hold them for, like, 20 minutes. 
 That's all right. We're going to do it in 15. 
 Let's go, guys! 
 Let's see how fast we can do this, huh? 
 [Whirring] 
 Where the hell is it? 
 It showed up, like, 30 seconds before you got here. 
 They didn't pull anything out! 
 There's no way they removed everything. 
 There's no way. God, it's got to be in here! 
 All right, what do we do? What do we do? 
 They got to be using buses, man. 
 What do we do? What do we do? 
 We put it back together. 
 You serious? 
 Yes. 
 Put it back together! 
 [Sighs] 
 God! 
 [Yells] Hey! Hey, hey, hey! 
 Hey! 
 How am I supposed to explain that? 
 This happened on the road. 
 That looked cathartic. 
 It was. 
 In that case... 
 [Yells] 
 God! [Metal clangs]

 Yeah, you put on those big earrings... 
 [Paul and Charlie talking in the background] 
 You know I can put them on right now if you want.

 Yeah? 
 What you up to, man? 
 Me? 
 Mm. 
 Oh, man, you know, just living the dream. 
 About to go scrub some toilets, 'cause I got them on the chore wheel next, and somebody very recently put puke in 'em. 
 You want to, um, spray while I scrub? 
 I'm good, man. 
 That's what I thought.

 You looking for company? 
 What are you looking for? 
 Hey! 
 Hold up. 
 ♪ 
 Thanks for dropping by, Paul. 
 Yeah, of course. 
 You know, I had to see how the new receptionist gig is going. 
 Very good. 
 Of course, they haven't seen my dark side. 
 Well, there's no reason that they should, right? 
 [Both laugh] 
 Kelly? What is it? 
 It's from the FBI. 
 You want to open it? 
 I can't. 
 Hey, come on now. 
 Maybe it's an answer. 
 Oh, my God. 
 What? 
 What is it? 
 I can't believe it. They paid. 
 It says that they have concluded the investigation, and they have paid. 
 It's $30,000 more than I thought it would be. 
 Wow. 
 Well, hey, this is great news, huh? 
 So this is it. 
 It's official now. 
 [Crying] He's gone. 
 [Sighs] Kelly. 
 Kelly, I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. 
 He's dead. 
 It's gonna be all right. 
 [Sobbing] 
 Shh. 
 [Sighs] So? 
 Uh, she was over the moon, Chuck. 
 Happier than I've ever seen a human being befo... you did it. 
 Thank you. 
 Yeah. 
 You fixed it, just like you said you would. 
 Thank you. 
 Yeah. 
 [Truck beeping] 
 Hey! 
 Nothing like starting the morning off with a little overtime, right? 
 Hey, you put some extra money in my pocket, I'm going to have a good day. 
 That's right. 
 Okay, Hanigan is out sick today, so what I need you to do is work with Walters, go in here, take all these barrels of waste, and load them into the back of that rig. 
 Yeah, sounds simple enough. 
 Okay.
