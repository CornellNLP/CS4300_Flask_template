 Previously on Graceland... 
 It's clever. 
 In one week's time, we begin the shipments. 
 You said one time. 
 I'm not lying to you. 
 After this is done, we take the money, and we get out of here for good. 
 We rob the bank. 
 If Sid's nest egg goes up in smoke, he's got to make a move. 
 What are you doing? 
 Cleaning up your mess. 
 What does that mean? 
 Maybe you're trying to screw me too. 
 Mike! 
 [Gunshot] 
 You must feel pretty stupid, huh? 
 I can just hold on to this for you. 
 There's nothing on my wrists. 
 But I like her. Bring her. 
 Goddamn b*st*rd. 
 No! [Screams] 
 Mike had three cuts: One on his forehead, one on his temple, and one on his palm. 
 What exactly are you suggesting? 
 We all know the kid's got a hard-on for the case, but I'm not sure murder is in his wheelhouse. 
 What about cover-up? 
 I can do this alone. 
 I just don't want to. 
 How long have you had the tape? 
 Couple of weeks. 
 Why didn't you just tell me? 
 I gave you every chance. 
 [Knocking] 
 Is that you? 
 Can we talk? 
 Like this. 
 I thought you'd run like the last time. 
 Charlie, last time, I stayed for you. 
 I'll always stay for you. 
 Let me in. 
 No, this is as close as we get. 
 You should move out. 
 Sweetheart, I'm sorry. That's simply not gonna work for me. 
 You don't have a say in it. 
 Until you take it away from me, I do have a say. 
 You're really gonna force my hand? 
 You listened to that tape. 
 Charlie, you know I didn't mean to kill him. 
 It's not about Juan. 
 All those times you lied to me, did you really think you were protecting me? 
 No. 
 I thought I was protecting myself. 
 Good night, Paul. 
 Good night, Charlie. 
 [Laid-back music] 
 You should have seen Sid's face. 
 I mean, his lifetime of cash is right in front of him, and he can't even touch it. 
 It was priceless. 
 That's enough, Johnny. 
 No, it's not. 
 Johnny, that's enough. 
 I know how to build a fire, Jakes. 
 You know how to blow us all up is what you know. 
 [Sighs] 
 Watch and learn, son. 
 Whoa. 
 Jesus. See? 
 Whoa. 
 I told your arsonous ass. 
 You're all right. Nothing happened to you. 
 You know, I started out chasing buses, and now I'm about to bring down an entire cartel and ring of crooked cops. 
 I mean, that's crazy, right? 
 Sounds like our job. How is that even crazy? 
 Yeah. You know what he's doing, right? 
 Huh? 
 Searching for a little, uh... 
 Oh, okay. Is that it, levi? 
 Want a little rub and tug? 
 Want a little jerk? 
 Want a little jerk? 
 A little rub and tug. 
 [Both laughing] 
 Neither of you guys care that we're this close? 
 Mm, we are not close. 
 We baited the hook. 
 Sid has yet to bite. 
 We just took $3 million from this guy. 
 Yeah, but he knows you took it. 
 He knows your plan. He knows you're coming. 
 Hey, if it was me, I'd cut my losses. 
 Go to work, retire on a nice government pension. 
 Not this guy. 
 He's not gonna go away a loser. 
 Mike, some people have greater ambitions in life than just winning. 
 Yeah? Like what? 
 Like surviving, for one.

 ♪ ♪ 
 It's bleak out here, bro. 
 I'm telling you. 
 Nothing lives. Nothing grows. 
 Like, name me one other place where animals don't even really hunt. 
 They just kind of, like, wait for you to run out of gas. 
 You complain too much. 
 Me? 
 Oh, bitching's like breathing to you. 
 It's not even hot. 
 It's dummy hot. 
 I hate the freaking desert. 
 How you gonna hate the desert? 
 Your Mexican ass is of the desert. 
 I'm from long beach. 
 It's too hot out here, huh? 
 See? What'd I say? 
 This our take? 
 20 million. 
 And Carlos Solano's expecting it by nightfall. 
 Thank you. We know the plan. 
 We made the plan. 
 Ah, damn, dude... 20 mil! 
 Tell me you never thought about peeling a little off and hitting Vegas. 
 No. 
 Maybe you haven't worked for señor Solano long enough. 
 There are some people you simply don't cross. 
 [Chuckles] 
 Yeah, there is a new guy. 
 You'll meet him. You'll like him. 
 Trust me. Otherwise, same deal as before. 
 Hey, hey, do me a favor. 
 Just, I don't know, send Carlito out to walk the dogs or something, all right? 
 He's been unreliable lately. 
 [Knocking] 
 I appreciate that. 
 Hey, boss. 
 Hey, pal. 
 Where'd everybody go? 
 24 hours R&R. 
 Oh, sh... 
 Street crime taking a day off too? 
 Yeah, let's hope so. 
 [Chuckles] 
 Listen, me and the gang, we're gonna take a little road trip tomorrow. 
 I was hoping you'd come along. 
 Hmm, road trip where? 
 Heading down south to Tecate. 
 Tecate? 
 Thought your contract with Carlos Solano expired. 
 Yeah, it did. 
 But I imagine he wants to make a new one. 
 Paul, if you're offered cash for police protection, what do you do? 
 [Chuckles] 
 You know, it's funny. 
 If you'd asked me that a few months ago, I... 
 I wasn't gonna tell you this, Sid, but... I got a kid on the way. 
 No sh1t is that right? 
 sh1t, yeah. 
 I mean, we're still in the first trimester, but... 
 Congratulations. That's big. 
 Yeah. 
 That's big. 
 Whatever it takes to make a life for my kid, that's what I'd do. 
 You got a passport, yeah? 
 F'ing eh. 
 We leave bright and early tomorrow morning, my man. 
 Thanks, boss. 
 Yeah. 
 You ever seen this much money before? 
 Counterfeit, yeah. 
 If it's counterfeit, the answer's no, Johnny. 
 sh1t looks real enough, yeah. 
 That's like saying, "you ever seen the Mona Lisa?" 
 And you say, "yeah, my mom had a poster." 
 Yeah, so I've seen it. 
 I can see your small brain working, but I don't understand why... 
 It's semantics. 
 You just don't know what I'm talking about right now. 
 Yo, P, ain't seeing the counterfeit basically the same thing as seeing the real thing? 
 I don't care, Johnny. 
 Hey, can you give us a hand at least? 
 What are you doing? 
 Marking bills. 
 Yep. 
 Take the money to Solano, Solano pays the G.T.F., and then Mike busts Sid with the wad of little, purple dots. 
 I got other things to do. 
 What things? 
 The money's basically the whole case. 
 Sid and Solano aren't the only elements. 
 This about Mike and the Russian girl? 
 Ukrainian. 
 Is there anything that you do know? 
 Shut up, dude. 
 Yo, what do you actually think he did? 
 I mean... 
 I think Lina's dead. 
 And Mike knew if he called it in that I'd close down the compound. 
 So he burned her body and faked her disappearance to cover his tracks. 
 Okay, we can't be talking about the same Mike. 
 The Mike Warren that you are talking about does not exist, Johnny. 
 Still don't see how that's an excuse not to help out. 
 Yo, you really think Mike would burn a body? 
 Hey, anybody can do anything under the right circumstances. 
 Yo. 
 Hey, yo, Briggs. 
 Mike's got us marking bills. You want to help out? 
 Sorry, Johnny boy. Hands are full. 
 Yeah, okay. 
 Run my parallel. Copy? 
 Copy. 
 Hold. Online. 
 Go. 
 She didn't waste much time. 
 Clear. 
 Sweep the room. 
 Check for anything she may have left behind. 
 She took a round. 
 Think we call vets and out-of-work surgeons? 
 Clear! 
 Nah, Amber did it herself. 
 I mean, I knew this broad was tough, but to pull a slug out of your own back? 
 You should have had a team here while she was playing doctor. 
 Me? This is your circus. 
 I was still dealing with the bank. 
 I was dealing with the bank. 
 What do you want? You want me to apologize? 
 Would that make you feel better? 
 I'm sick of coming up empty-handed aren't you? 
 No doubt. 
 Okay. 
 I'll find her, Mike. 
 Well, she's not here, and she's not answering your calls. 
 So I think she's... 
 Mike. 
 I will find her. 
 All right. Let me know. 
 [Rock music] 
 ♪ ♪ 
 You're the guy I talk to about refills? 
 I am that guy. Give me a sec. 
 There we are. 
 Where'd you pick that up, on Martha Stewart or something? 
 My ex used to sell these at trade fairs. 
 Now she earns more than I do, so... a lot nicer than shredding up bobcats, I'll tell you that. 
 Should I take my business elsewhere? 
 [Chuckles] 
 Nah, these things aren't jumping off the shelf. 
 Co2, argon. 
 No problem. 
 You know, I don't remember selling you this. 
 Kind of pride myself on remembering. 
 I wasn't the one who bought it. 
 You know Amber? 
 Oh, you're rolling with the pixie, huh? 
 I'm looking for her, actually. 
 I was hoping you had a forwarding address maybe. 
 Nothing springs to mind. 
 That's funny. 
 What happened to your famous memory, Duke? 
 What is it they say? 
 Even the best swimmers get caught in the undertow. 
 Oh, is that what they say? 
 'Cause here's the deal. 
 Amber ran off with a considerable sum of money, much of which I have a pretty fair claim to. 
 Lady, I don't know sh1t about sh1t. 
 If you think some imaginary address is worth shooting me over... 
 Oh, I'm not gonna shoot you, Duke. 
 [Gunshot] 
 Whoa. 
 Goddamn criminals don't leave forwarding addresses, lady. 
 Emergency phone number? 
 Nothing? 
 Listen, I'm about to burn this whole shed down, so unless you think that terrarium sh1t's got legs... 
 Mother of Mary, yeah, I got a damn number. 
 Let's go. 
 What'd you get? 
 Oh, it's a new number. She didn't pick up. 
 I left a voice mail, explained that there were no hard feelings. 
 I just want my cut. 
 How can I help? 
 You can't. For now, it's just waiting. 
 [Sighs] 
 I'm starting to feel a little useless here. 
 You guys are all boots on the ground, and I'm just here moving pieces. 
 Yeah, well, the good thing about moving pieces, Mikey, is you don't have to take the flack. 
 I'll talk to you. Copy that. If I ask you a question, will you answer it honestly? Ask me what? At Sulla's, how did you feel? I mean, I've gone over and over that day. And I get that I was being unreasonable in a way, trying to stay there, and why you thought it seemed like a good idea to do what you did. I do. But when he hit me, when he physically hit me, how did you feel? When I was a kid, my grandpa had this cabin upstate, and we'd go hiking. And it seemed like every time we went hiking, we'd come across a fox trap, an empty one, after the fox had... gnawed off his leg. Yeah and I always felt so bad for that poor, hobbled fox. And I thought about how horrible it must feel. But now I know that that part, the after, that's the easy part. The hard part is when... is when you whittle it down to two options. You can either wait it out, die, or you can take this piece of yourself, and you can... you can mutilate it, destroy it, and maybe live. Does that answer your question? Yeah. It's actually quite incredible that even when you're talking about me being slapped around, you're the fox. What am I, Mike? I'm... I'm the leg? What do you want from me? I want you back in the trap. [Knocking] Yo. Come on in. No. This is no bueno, Johnny. No, no, there's a Fiesta Inn just down the street, man. No, man, look, the Solanos have eyes all over Tecate. Okay, and cheap-ass hotels... they don't check I.D.'s, so this is what we got. God damn. [Bed squeaking] Dibs, I guess. Hey, dude, I was thinking, you know, tonight or in the morning or whatever, you could head home if you want. Nah, man, Mike's gonna let us know when Sid's in custody. Until then, we stay. Yeah, but if we're doing nothing but hanging out here, I can do all that by myself. You know? What'd you do, Johnny? I didn't do nothing. What'd you do, Johnny? I didn't do nothing, Jakes. Look, man, I don't want Lucia at that house if sh1t goes down. All right, between Carlito and Sid and now Mike's burning bodies or something, it's too hot. I don't want her there. Do you hear yourself? I'll bring her here in the morning, all right, before any of the arrests. It'd be better if you weren't here. Are you really trying to clear me out, so you can get your little burrito off? Fine, Johnny. Have it your way. This place sucks anyway. That girl's gonna be the death of you. Nah. I got this under control. [Phone vibrating] Yeah. Arkin. This is C.B.P. We caught a girl coming through immigration over at L.A.X. Oh, immigration. That's not my... Suspect says you got an A.P.B. out for her. Her name is Lina Veselov. Are you sure that it's her? I'm looking right at her, yeah. I'm on my way. On top of the table's fine. Welcome, Johnny. I miss having a young person here who exhibits a touch of accountability. Father, when you wake up one day and realize both your children have left you, maybe you will exhibit a touch of accountability. My daughter... my children, both of them... everything is such a spectacle. Welcome to my home. I'm surprised you invited me, frankly. Hospitality breeds loyalty, no? So we just take our cut from here? No, from there. One for the each of us? No, just one. The other one is for my partner. See what we got. Your salary. All right. All this coming in, isn't it easier just to give us the new stuff? I always have some cash on hand to serve as payment, money that hasn't been in circulation for some time. In case someone's tracking it. That's smart, good looking out. I'll have somebody come and collect it. Yeah, we'll unload the bins. Dude, get those marked bills into Sid's briefcase. Señor Solano. Um, you know, last time I was here, there was this horse... La Soñadora. Yeah, we kind of hit it off. I was hoping maybe I could go feed her some carrots before we leave. I'm sure she would love it. Thank you, sir. Go. 
 
 [Horse neighs] Just so you know, I never meant to take off without saying anything. Your father, he set me up... you know, I've never seen the southern cross. Have you? The constellation? Yeah, I've seen it in pictures. That's not the same thing. Well, yeah, it kind of is. I love the idea that there's a whole nother world of stars out there. Mmhmm. I mean, we look up at the same sky every night and take it for granted. But there are people out there, who look up and they see something completely different. Right. I have no idea what you're talking about right now. I want to live under the southern cross. Okay. When do we leave? Tomorrow morning. Okay, there's a motel on Highway 2, a little sh1t hole place. I know it. You know it? Room nine. Got it. Don't be late. I won't. Don't be late. I won't. All right, bye. Perfecto. I see he has a stranger handle his money now. How long you been watching me? Relax. If I wanted you to be hurt, you would be hurt. I don't think we've been properly introduced. But you know who I am. Yeah. Yeah. Johnny told me a few things. Mmm. And you're afraid that my dispute with Johnny extends to you, yes? I assure you that's not the case. Then put the gun down. There you go. You know, someday, my father will be gone. But I see no reason why all this business should have to stop. Do you agree? Me? I work for whoever cuts my checks. I think you and I should be friends. Yeah. Thing is your daddy... your daddy still runs the show. So I really don't need any new friends, now, do I? Hey, what's up? Hola. Is everything still going according to plan? Some things may have to change. Hey, Doc, when's the first time you realized that you would be spending the rest of your life poking pregnant women? Ms. DeMarco, let's just try to relax, why don't we? Sorry, I'm nervous. There we are. What am I looking at? See this little black shape here? Is that my baby? [Chuckles] It looks like a peanut. Well, you won't recognize it as a baby for a few more weeks. Is it... is it okay? Is it doing everything it's supposed to be doing? You appear to have a very healthy fetus. And for the next 35 weeks, you and the peanut are in lockstep. When you're hungry, the peanut's hungry. When you're tired, the peanut's tired. And when you're distressed... The peanut's distressed? So what you have to do now is to create a healthy climate for yourself because that's how you create a healthy climate for the baby. So does that mean I have to quit my job? That depends. What's your job? Just clerical work and, you know, pushing papers and stuff. Pushing papers should be just fine. That is, unless the papers start to push back. Wow. [Chuckles] The girl didn't have much on her, just a letter and a passport. The passport's a pretty good forgery. Would've made it through if it weren't for that missing persons you had out. How is she? Scared. Tired, I think. It's a long flight from Kiev. What do you mean "from Kiev"? Well, that's where she came in from. No, Lina was already in the U.S. I don't know what to tell you, but our girl was definitely inbound. That's not Lina. Who gave you this? Government of Ukraine. What's your name? Lina Veselov. No, what's your name? Lina Allochka Veselov. You're not 19. How old are you? 15? 16? I don't know who you are, but I know that you are not Lina. And since you have no legitimate I.D., I will happily detain you for the rest of your natural life. Now, who sent you here? My father. He's sick, he could not come. And the man who make Lina her passport, he put my face because I am too much young. Your Lina's sister. Irina. Your name is Irina. No, look at me. Look. I know your sister. We're friends. You're woman in letter? Lina sends letter that she runs. She has no home. She... my father says to me to go and find. Scottsdale. How could she send this if... [speaking Russian] Nothing. [Dramatic music] ♪ ♪ You ever miss office work, Warren? No, sir. Wind-up toys and ill-fitting suits. Wind-up toys, huh? What are they even doing? Oh, them? They're working within the bounds of the law. Hey, good morning, Agent Warren. What the hell is this? Well, this is a... what did you call it? You called it a courtesy call so you can get your affairs in order. I think I can handle this. Thank you. Getty National Bank. What was the target? Our target was Amber. She's all over major crimes' wish list. When you filed for approval on your bank operation, did you indicate that Detective Markham had several accounts there? No, sir. No, sir. And why would that be? Because that would have looked like that we were recruiting Amber in order to circumvent the warrant required to enter Sid's safe deposit boxes. Right. And did you? No, sir. It was a happy accident. Detective Markham contacted the U.S. Attorney's office this morning. Having you brought up on charges. This is absurd, sir. You're not taking this seriously. Of course he's taking it seriously. It's the fourth amendment. Meaning as our forefathers itemized the pillars on which to build a republic, unlawful search and seizure came up fourth. All right, that's enough. You want to showboat, take it somewhere else. Yeah, right. What am I thinking? You guys, of course, understand our constitution. I'm looking forward to speaking with you. Sir, the U.S. Attorney is not gonna bring me up on charges once we arrest Detective Markham for corruption, trafficking, and murder. I'll make a call. See if can get him to hold off on an indictment. Thank you, sir. No, don't thank me. This isn't for you. You get strung up on this, we're all swinging from the gallows. Look, I know you think you're some kind of righteous avenger here, but legal's already building a firewall between you and the Bureau. And every second that little prick's not in cuffs, your stock is going down. Well, then I shouldn't be wasting my time here, sir. How'd that work out for you? Jesus Christ. Did he take your badge? I'm not doing this with you right now. This might be our last chance we have to chat, Mike. Once you're indicted, your lawyers will probably advise you otherwise. You know, you think you're so smart, don't you? I'm not frigging Socrates, but actually I do. Yeah, yeah, this little run-and-tell-dad routine here? You think the Bureau's actually gonna fall for that? Well, I don't see you smiling. I'm saving it. Let me tell you something. I've been doing this job for a while. And one thing that you learn really fast when you're working on the street is how to smell the difference between strong and scared. [Inhales deeply] Right now, I think I smell scared. Wow. Still smell scared? You're blooming, kid. Yeah. You're blooming. [Grunts] How you've managed to... cause me so much trouble... is baffling. You're stupid, cocky. You're sloppy. And I'm still gonna catch you, too. Get off of me. Geez. You. This is you and me. This is our dance now, okay? You want it to end, you're gonna have to end it. That's the plan, asshole. Yeah? [Grunts] Jesus! Oh. [Laughs] I just... I let him sucker me in. I'm so stupid. No. There's nothing stupid about being passionate. Sometimes a man has to take action, you know. Yeah? Well, now Clark wants to babysit my whole OP like I'm some child. And you ripped your suit. It's a bitch, isn't it? Realizing the Bureau's turned against you? I don't know. Maybe they're right. Maybe they should indict me. No, you're being too hard on yourself, Mike. This whole thing runs according to a very basic arithmetic. Unfortunately, it only becomes clear once you got the bad guy in cuffs. You weigh the damage that you did versus the damage that he would have. As long as you're in the black, it's all good. You're in the black. What if I can't catch him? What if I've done what I've done and there's no victory to tip the scale? Well, maybe that's where atonement comes in. Except I'm not interested in atonement. You're sure this is from your sister? Yes. Yes, it is Lina. Look. She calls me Zaichik. It means... rabbit. Yes, rabbit. Zaichik. It is Lina. In letter, she says woman comes to save her. Lives with bad man but is take away. You are woman? Yeah. You are very brave. No. She's the brave one. Yes. She also. She runs from man who wants her as wife. She hides in truck. She is afraid, but she says... "At least I'm in America." How was this folded when you got it? Was it like this, with the writing on the outside when you got it? Yes, yes, it is how it comes. I'm gonna need to take this as evidence. I'm gonna get you a flight back to Kiev. Nyet. I don't leave. Only with Lina. No, I swear to father. I swear it. Send her back to Kiev. There's nothing for her here. Ah, sh1t. [Scoffs] Mike. Where are we at on Amber? Nowhere. She hasn't called yet. I heard you scrapped it up with Sid. Why didn't you run his ass in right there for assaulting a Federal Agent? Because I kind of started it. Smart. Yeah. [Chuckles] Come tomorrow, it won't mean anything. Yeah, says the guy sporting a black eye. What, this? This is nothing. This is... this is an echo. It's just a reminder of something in the past. I'll wear a thousand of these to catch that guy. We do what we have to, Charlie, even if it hurts. Especially if it hurts. [Exhales deeply] What's that? More echoes. Stay back. Guns now? [Grunting] [Gunfire] It sounds like an accident. Juan's on some misguided mission and Briggs, he... It was a mix-up. In a manner of speaking. Well, if Juan's not there posing as jangles, then... Juan made a mistake, no doubt. He had no idea what the hell he was doing when he put that bandana on his face. And that mistake cost him his life. But let me tell you something. None of that happens... none of it... if Briggs wasn't perpetuating a long-term criminal enterprise. Juan's not looking at him if he's not skimming drugs, if he's not selling them to Bello, if he's... if he's not Odin Rossi. Why don't I just go to the Bureau with this? I'm leaving the house when I'm done with this Amber case. Come on. I'm pregnant. You're pregnant? And it's Briggs'. Charlie. Mike... I need your help. I can't turn him in. He's the father of my child. And I still love him, you know. Okay, okay. If you're gonna be living with him, you have to be the one that makes the decision. I've got too much to think about right now. Why me? Because you're not sentimental, Mike. Yes, I am. Okay. Okay. We're all set up to arrest Sid in the G.T.F. tomorrow at the border. I have to arrest Briggs to keep his cover. I could just keep him. I... whatever you do with the tape, be careful. Saturn and Marconi. Where's that? Huntington park? [Mouths silently] Okay, I don't know if I can make it there that fast. Yeah. Yeah, I'm on my way. What's going on? She wants to meet up, make amends. Amends? You sure about that? I really don't care. Either way, I'm bringing her in. I'd come with, but I'm headed to the border right now. That's fine. Can you give me a support team? Yeah, I'll call it in. You said Saturn and Marconi? I got 30 minutes. They'll be there. [Knocking] Hey. Hey. Nobody saw you? I've been sneaking out of that place my whole life. Yeah. Hey, so, can I talk to you real quick? If you're worried about money... I'm not, I told you... I have something to help us. What did you do? What? You're stealing his daughter. You might as well steal his money, too. Johnny? What did you do? [Rock music plays over radio] ♪ ♪ [Honks horn] Come on! [Car crashing] [Tires screeching] Amber... Amber, please don't do... don't do this! Please, Amber. No! ♪ ♪ What the hell is this? [Speaking spanish] I don't know how you drink this with so much sh1t in there, Martinez. That's a good cookie recipe in there. Mitigation. Precinct coffee's like sucking petroleum out of an asshole. Nice. I don't know. I like the petroleum. I think you just like the asshole. Anybody know why Sid's late? Who knows? Man operates on a higher level. Speak for yourself, Archie. Paulie here, he's walking in the clouds. Jesus Christ. What happened to you? Picked a fight and I lost. I hope you got the moral victory at least. Let's go. We got a long ride.
