 Previously on Graceland... 
 You are now agents of the Federal Bureau of Investigation. 
 There's been a change in your assignment. 
 Where am I going? 
 Southern California. 
 They're putting you in Graceland. 
 Hey, why do they call it "Graceland"? 
 When they seized it from this drug lord, he was apparently some hard-core Elvis fan, the name just kinda stuck. 
 So you, me, Briggs, and Charlie are FBI. 
 Jakes is customs and Paige is DEA. 
 It works, having three agencies in one house? 
 We all start to blend together after a while. 
 Your assignment is to investigate Briggs. 
 I heard they kinda slammed you with this job, huh? 
 Yeah, they did. 
 Mm. No idea why? 
 No, sir. 
 I'm your control officer for your investigation into Paul Briggs. 
 Get in tight with him. It's not easy. 
 That's why we chose you. 
 In this line of work, there are people that you need to be able to trust. 
 We must come first. 
 Briggs is a complicated guy who does things in an unorthodox manner, but he gets results. 
 Narcotics recovery report. 
 Sometimes we get more... 
 With Briggs, it's always less. 
 And always heroin. 
 Hi. My name is Paul, and I'm a heroin addict. 
 Paul Briggs is not a criminal. He deserves our help. 
 Like he chose to do heroin. 
 He didn't do this to himself. 
 This guy saved my life. 
 You're gonna help me get Briggs. 
 No, I'm not. 
 Odin Rossi's mark. 
 You know Odin? 
 Everyone's talking about his quality. 
 You are Odin Rossi. 
 Always have been. 
 Don't move. 
 You're federale? 
 Maybe we can work together. 
 Odin has a beef with Jangles. 
 Jangles is here. 
 Caza cartel's boogeyman. 
 This is agent Juan Badillo. 
 I am undercover as Jangles. 
 [Gunshot] 
 I've been investigating you for the past three months. 
 The agent that gave me this assignment is missing, and the FBI thinks you're responsible. 
 They think he might have been wearing a wire and that the disappearance might be on a tape in his car. 
 I killed an FBI agent, and they got it on tape. 
 There's no way I beat him to that recording now. 
 He won. I lost. So what are you gonna do? 
 Get a head start. 
 A start on what? 
 The rest of my life. 
 Where's the recorder? 
 I don't know. 
 Better question is... 
 Where the hell's Briggs? 
 [Cell phone ringing] 
 No answer? 
 I have to call it in. 
 There is a big space between ducking a call and going on the lam. 
 He thinks we found the recording. 
 Yeah, but we didn't. 
 But he thinks we did. 
 Mike. 
 Paige. 
 Hi. This is Mike Warren, L.A. 
 I need to put a bolo out on the wire. 
 It's one of ours... Paul Briggs. 
 Yes, sir, on my authority. 
 [Cell phone chimes] 
 Joey Tata. Big plans tonight, dog? 
 No, not tonight. 
 All right, let me know if something comes up. Hey, dude, did you, uh... 
 Did you get this text? Oh, my phone's off. 
 There's a "detain on sight" order out on you. 
 From Warren. 
 Yeah. 
 Just part of my cover with the mongrels. 
 So I don't got to, like, take you down or nothing? 
 Brother, you can try. 
 You know I'd knock your ass out, boy. 
 Okay. How about this? 
 Tomorrow you and I rally the troops for a little full-contact, three-on-three action out on the sand, but you put some money where that big mouth of yours is. 
 Hold on, dude. 
 This don't feel right. It don't. 
 Whoa. Johnny boy. 
 Wow. The level of paranoia in this house... 
 It's gone defcon. 
 John boy... 
 It's me. 
 Mmhmm. 
 Okay? 
 Still time on the clock. 
 Later. 
 Later. 
 [Door closes] 
 Just saw that bolo, man. 
 Yeah, let's move. 
 So y'all good from here? 
 Yeah. 
 Look, D.J., I got to say, man... nah, man, you don't got to say nothing. 
 My old man used to tell me don't name a pig you plan to eat. 
 Texas wisdom, huh? 
 You're the pig. 
 Yeah. [Both laugh] 
 Don't get attached. 
 Makes for easy good-byes. 
 Well, look, I hope I didn't leave the heat on too high. 
 I like a little heat. 
 Keep an eye on everybody for me, especially Charlie. 
 Okay. Wherever you end up, don't send a postcard. 
 Never that. 
 [Engine turning] 
 This is bad, huh? 
 Yeah, Johnny, this is bad. 
 What part of "detain on sight" don't you understand, Johnny? 
 The part that has Briggs' name next to it. 
 What the hell's going on? 
 Where is he? 
 You gonna let me in my house? 
 Where's he hiding, man? 
 You need to understand the reality of this situation. 
 Oh, okay. 
 Please, Dale. 
 You could get three years for accessory. 
 I gave a friend a ride. That's it. 
 He didn't wait to see if we found the recording. 
 It screams guilty. 
 Y'all didn't find it, did you? 
 Wait, wait, wait, wait. 
 So I got to deal with Charlie and her punk-ass federale, and Jakes is doing time for giving Briggs a ride? 
 Charlie's messing with a federale? 
 Yeah. 
 Who is he? 
 I don't know. They met in some hotel room chasing Odin. 
 The bureau's sending a team over. 
 I suggest that you be here. Tell your team I'm in my room. 
 Looks like you could use one of these, Q. 
 You followed? 
 Hell, no. 
 You were not joking about your face. 
 Told ya. 
 Your friend packs a hell of a punch. 
 Yeah. That she does. 
 Yeah, you know, your call kind of surprised me. 
 I mean, you really think you're being sold out? 
 I know it. 
 Your girl shows up asking questions, and now I got trusted sources telling me that Jangles is after me. 
 Jangles. Yeah, right, the, uh... 
 The key guy. The goddamn assassin. 
 He descends on you, and he carves you up. 
 You got everything? 
 Yeah. Yeah, everything you asked for. 
 Everybody said you need a new identity fast, you're the man. 
 Well, look, man, our last meeting might not have gone too well, but our friendship is deeper than that. 
 The ink's still wet on these. 
 You got a burner phone with a South American card, as requested, passports, driver's license, credit cards... all with the name Anthony Busca. 
 Busca, huh? 
 I look like a Tony Busca? 
 Oh, man, like you were born to it. 
 I also got you on a boat to Ecuador. 
 You're not on the official manifest, so the accommodations may be less than comfy. 
 I don't care, as long as you get me out of here. 
 Oh, yeah. 
 Here you go. 
 We good? We good. 
 Jangles is never gonna find you, man. 
 [Boat horn blows] 
 That's you. It's a new life, Tony B. 
 Don't screw it up the way you screwed up the last one, huh? 
 Back at ya.

 All right. 
 I see you're suddenly in the pig-naming mood, huh? 
 Hey. I'm glad I caught you. 
 I didn't think your phone would work. 
 Uh, yeah, well, you know, we're hugging the coast. 
 I guess I got lucky. What's up, D.J.? 
 Listen, there's no recording. 
 Really? 
 The way Mike talked about it, I'm almost positive. 
 Well, if you're not 100%, it's just a daydream. 
 Yeah, well, I just wanted you to know. 
 And, hey, since you asked me to keep an eye on her, you have any idea why Charlie would be digging into you with a federale? 
 A federale? 
 That's the word. 
 No. No, that's news to me. 
 Where'd she find him? I don't know. 
 They met in a hotel or something. 
 I appreciate the update. 
 You got it.

 Well, monotony has a new definition.

 ♪ 
 Start recording, please. 
 This is Adic Clarke. 
 This is case number tx1138... investigation into the disappearance of agent Paul Briggs eight days ago. 
 Speaking first with agent Tuturro... let's begin. 
 Finally. You gonna explain some sh...? 
 Why do you believe you were assigned to Graceland? 
 I was brought into the house to investigate Briggs. 
 Two weeks ago, Mike told me why he was here. 
 Agent Warren was assigned to Graceland to investigate Paul Briggs. 
 Mikey... he's a rat? 
 Wait. What? 
 Great. 
 Jakes... what's his involvement? 
 He and Jakes were close. 
 He felt betrayed, of course. 
 Did I think it would send him running? No. 
 I figured agent Briggs would turn to him. 
 Jakes and Briggs had secrets. 
 Jakes knew Briggs was dirty. 
 He went to Jakes? 
 He asked me drive him to the port. 
 Didn't say why. I didn't ask. 
 Jakes provided a boat for Briggs to escape. 
 You sh... ing me? Call the goddamn coast guard already. 
 Why is Briggs on a boat? 
 Should I be asking for an attorney? 
 Why would Briggs run? 
 Paul thought that we had a recording that implicated him in the murder of Juan Badillo. 
 Murder? 
 You serious? 
 [Scoffs] 
 My brain isn't processing any of this. 
 This is stupid. We're talking about Paul Briggs, right? I stopped listening to you. 
 How much longer will this take? 
 I wouldn't worry about that, agent Warren. 
 I put the rest of your case load on hold, so there's plenty of time. 
 And unless we find Paul Briggs, I'll have to shut down Graceland. 
 I hope you don't have anything incriminating in there. 
 No. Just some old-ass Chinese takeout for them. 
 Oh, no, man, I live here. 
 Nah. You have to wait until they finish sweeping. You got to be kidding me. 
 They're looking for evidence of collusion with Briggs. 
 They're going through our rooms? 
 Hey, Mikey! Why don't you go ahead, man. 
 I'm sure they'll let you through. 
 No, I'm not on their team. 
 Yeah, says the rat. 
 Both of you back off. 
 What do you mean back off? 
 You siding with him on this? He's a snitch, Charlie. 
 You left your right to lecture back at the port, Dale. 
 Yeah, and you gave up yours when you started banging the rat. Come on. 
 Whoa, whoa, whoa. All right, man, talk when you don't know what you're talking about. 
 Boy, fall back. 
 Boy. 
 Stop. Stop! 
 Fall back! 
 He's right. 
 What do you mean he's right? 
 You know, you and him ran Briggs off. 
 You think Briggs is innocent? 
 Hell, yes, I do. 
 Look, Briggs don't deal drugs, and he don't kill FBI agents. 
 And you don't run when you're innocent. 
 What about  the fugitive? 
 That's a movie, Johnny. 
 Everybody stop pointing fingers, okay? 
 You want to be mad at somebody, be at the person who's not here. 
 Because the five of us... we are stuck in this together. 
 Okay. We're done with the rooms. 
 Thank you. 
 Thank you! 
 Doesn't matter. 
 We're not gonna be together much longer anyway. 
 What does that mean? 
 That means they're not gonna keep letting us surf and pay utilities around here like nothing ever happened. You heard Clarke. 
 With Briggs in the wind, Graceland's burnt. 
 Not like there's much to save here anyway. 
 Dale Jakes... 
 Come on, John boy. 
 No rousing halftime speech today? 
 Joke. 
 Guys, we can still save the house if we find Briggs. 
 You serious, man? 
 Yeah, I'm serious. 
 And if I'm right, they're not gonna shut down Graceland. 
 Yo, there's no way we're finding Briggs. 
 Johnny, you giving up? 
 [Scoffs] 
 Yo, can we talk? 
 What do you want, Johnny? 
 Yo, man, if Briggs needed help... 
 Why would he go to you? 
 Did you really just come in here to ask me why Briggs chose me over you? 
 No. 
 Really? 
 Yeah, dude, yeah! 
 What did I do wrong? 
 Grow up, Johnny. 
 This wide-eyed, pouty-faced sh1t. 
 Maybe Briggs would have turned to you if you acted less a child and more a man. 
 Then you could be the accomplice to murder and not me. 
 All right. 
 I got more. 
 I want to hear it. 
 Briggs and I... 
 We go way back, all right? Way back... before you. 
 And sometimes people are messed up, and there's nothing more to it, and they hurt people even when they're trying not to. 
 Mm-hmm. 
 Period. 
 I know. I just don't understand why they don't try harder. 
 We can prove all of it. 
 We can prove what really happened. 
 The house burns down. 
 [Echoing] The agents inside burn with it. 
 You're gonna find out real fast there are no secrets at Graceland. 
 Except for Briggs. 
 Yeah. Except for Briggs. 
 I was young, ambitious, and in love. 
 Who was the girl? 
 That, my friend, is a story for another place and time. 
 One minute later, another call was made from the same pay phone to Lisa, one of the agents in the house. 
 [Echoing] Everyone knew that they were a couple. 
 What are you working on? 
 Jakes put him on a boat. 
 He's probably on another continent by now. 
 You're not gonna find Briggs on any map. 
 I'm trying to find him up here. 
 Did you know that there was another house before this? 
 It was called the estate, and it burned down. 
 Mmhmm. It'll mess you up. 
 He was in love. 
 With who? 
 With one of his roommates. 
 This woman... Lisa. She's DEA. 
 Was.  She died in the fire. 
 God. 
 I know where Briggs is. 
 Where? 
 It all makes sense now. 
 Where is he? 
 He's here. 
 He's here. He never left. 
 It all makes sense. 
 Jangles. Jangles burned the house down. 
 Jangles killed Lisa. Briggs would never let that go. 
 Mike, stop. Stop moving. 
 Stop thinking. Just stop. 
 You have done everything a good agent would do. 
 Well, Juan's dead. This house is burned. 
 And that's all because I'm not good enough, so... 
 He fooled all of us, Mike. 
 [Sighs] Believe me, there is a... 
 A version of that that I want, but... 
 Not like this. 
 Why's that? 
 'Cause that wasn't about me. 
 You're lost, Mike, and... 
 I'm not the answer. 
 Hola, mamita. 
 Listen, I got a question for you. 
 What can you tell me about your federales working in my area? 
 Oh, yeah? What if I buy you dinner? 
 [Laughs] 
 Uh-huh. So how many in my area? 
 ¿Cinco hombres?  Mendez in Long Beach. 
 Okay. Who else? 
 Yeah, you'll hear from me soon. 
 Te amo. 
 Kid's got your moves. 
 [Crowd cheering] 
 
 
 
 What the hell are you doing back here? 
 That's my frickin' son! 
 I'm sorry. 
 Nobody else knows about Daniel. 
 I figured this would be a safe place to talk to you. 
 I'm suspended pending investigation, thanks to you. 
 They're talking possible criminal charges. 
 I am so sorry, man. 
 The bureau thinks you're in the middle of the ocean. 
 What are you doing here? Charlie- that federale you said she's hanging out with? 
 I think that could be Jangles. 
 Just tell her. 
 I can't! 
 She'd never believe me now. Chances are, she'd tell him and end up getting herself killed. 
 That's because she thinks you're full of sh..., Paul. 
 She thinks you're Odin Rossi. 
 A lot of things went wrong, D.J. 
 Are you Odin Rossi? 
 Look, I know you're running low on confidence, brother, but could you please hang with me for a little while longer? 
 Do you have any idea what you did to everybody? 
 You know what? If I'm wrong, I'm probably gonna end up in jail for a very long time. 
 But if there's a chance that I could be right, I cannot leave Charlie alone with that monster. 
 If you're back to play the hero... too late. 
 Nobody's buying. 
 All right, look, here's the number to a burner. 
 Keep watching Charlie for me. 
 If you hear something, please call me. 
 I got to make this right. 
 I'm gonna go watch my son make me proud. 
 So I leave tomorrow. 
 With Odin gone and everything, I can't stay here. 
 It's a shame. I was just starting to like you. 
 Just now? 
 Just this very second. 
 I think it's the accent. 
 [Chuckles] I should speak more. 
 [Chuckling] 
 Hey, you ever had one of your own go bad? 
 Never in Mexico. 
 Right. 
 I remember this name, uh... Paul Briggs. 
 He's a very respectable agent. 
 A little bit reckless, though. 
 That's our Paulie. 
 You were lovers. 
 That obvious? 
 Well, you're very, very passionate about him. 
 Yeah. I had no idea he was so broken. 
 I... I'm sorry if this hurts for you. 
 Well, to Paul Briggs. 
 You took a chunk of my heart with you, you son of a bitch. 
 To mending your broken heart. 
 Salud.  [Glasses clink] 
 Cheers. 
 I thought I might find you out here. 
 I really don't need another lecture about helping Briggs out. 
 I know he's still here. 
 Yeah? 
 Well, you got a lot of stupid ideas lately. 
 Why do you think he's still here? 
 When I was in high school, I was a suspect for a major theft in my town. 
 You? 
 Yep. 
 My grandfather called me, and he said, "listen, Mike, don't come home. 
 "There's cops everywhere. It's Friday night. 
 If they arrest you, we can't bail you out till Monday." 
 Your grandpa told you this. 
 He was cool. 
 My point is, I should have left town, but I couldn't. 
 Instead, I went to a friend's house who lived up the street. 
 I just had to see it for myself. 
 You're a control freak, and so is Briggs. 
 Is that the point? 
 Bingo. 
 What'd you steal? 
 The Christmas display at burger king. 
 [Chuckles] You're a bad man. 
 I had to have that giant candy cane. 
 Look, I know Briggs didn't leave town. 
 There's only one person he can trust right now. 
 Listen up, rat. 
 I'm not helping Briggs. 
 Now, please excuse me while I go someplace you're not. 
 Thank you. 
 So your last day in sunny cali... how you gonna spend it? 
 I rent a house on the beach. 
 Oh, look at you... living large. 
 Una vez Al año no hace daño. 
 "Once a year doesn't hurt"... I like that. 
 I have some great champagne. 
 Do you? 
 Yeah. 
 You should come. 
 Truth is, my life is at a low point right now, and I just can't take much more of an emotional beating. 
 So... 
 I'm really tempted, but I think platonic is the best for me. 
 I understand. 
 If you change your mind... 
 [Cell phone rings] Hey, Mike. 
 Briggs is still in town. 
 I got his burner number. I'm tracking him right now. 
 Seriously? 
 What's going on? 
 Mike says he knows where Briggs is. 
 I don't know how long I'll be able to track him. 
 Listen to me. I want you out of this. 
 I'll hit you guys when I'm done. 
 Mike. 
 What'd he say? 
 Hello? Anybody home? 
 Don't make me drink alone. 
 [Keys jingling] 
 [Gun cocks] 
 Gun on the ground! 
 Now! 
 Remember me now, you son of a bitch? 
 Huh? Hmm? 
 Hello? 
 I'm here. 
 Paul? 
 Get off him, Paul. Don't do this, Charlie! 
 I said off! 
 This man is Jangles. 
 I'm telling you. I'll shoot you, Paul. 
 I swear to God. 
 Get off him. 
 Let him go! 
 [Coughing] 
 I'm telling you, this is him. 
 You met him in a hotel room where I set a trap. 
 He burned down the estate. 
 [Hoarsely] He's lying, Catherine. 
 He tried to kill me. 
 It's just me. You know me. 
 Enough! Enough! He's down! 
 Back off! 
 There's still a pulse. Call an ambulance. 
 I will call your bureau right away. 
 Restrain him. 
 This is Rafael Cortes of the  policia federal. 
 I hate you. 
 Why'd you have to mess everything up, huh? 
 [Zip tie closes] 
 The bureau? They're sending an ambulance. 
 Why'd he come here? 
 Who knows? 
 Perhaps jealousy. 
 You two had a past. 
 What if he saw me with you in the parking lot? 
 You did come back. 
 Yeah. 
 Una vez... 
 Whatever you said. 
 Una vez Al año. 
 Why did he call you Jangles? 
 Who knows why men say these things? 
 I'm really glad you came, Catherine. 
 I told you not to call me Catherine.

 How could you be so sure? 
 Because he killed Lisa. 
 Yeah. 
 You know, I loved that woman. 
 [Lisa laughs] No one will ever come close. 
 I only told you part of the story. 
 Jangles had me... 
 Kept shooting me up with "H" day after day after day after day, over and over, you know, till he got me hooked hard. 
 Briggs, what did he want to know? 
 The whole time he only asked me one question... 
 Just one, the whole time. 
 "Who?" 
 Who?

 Roberto... 
 Roberto Ganzia. 
 He's my friend. 
 You gave him your training officer? 
 Yeah. 
 I gave him Roberto. I did. 
 Jangles found him, and thanks to me, he found him living with a whole house full of my fellow agents, including Lisa. 
 [People screaming] 
 And he torched them all. 
 You know the worst part? 
 He knew that living with what I had done would be worse than any death. 
 [Sirens wailing] 
 And he was right. 
 Hey, there he is. 
 You wanted to see me, sir? 
 The bureau is awful proud of their golden boy. 
 I don't know about that. 
 No one from D.C. call you yet? 
 No, sir. 
 Guess I'm the first. 
 Juan offered you a ticket to D.C. 
 When all this started... we're gonna honor that. 
 So they're offering you specialist assistant to the deputy director. 
 [Exhales deeply] 
 Wow. Wow. That's big. 
 Thank you. 
 Warren, that's huge. Congratulations. 
 Thank you. 
 Tell you what... 
 I'll look you up next time I'm in D.C. 
 We'll get lunch, huh? Great. 
 Hey, what about Graceland, sir? 
 What about it? 
 It's not burned? 
 Not that I'm aware of. 
 And I wanted to ask you something about Briggs. 
 Walk with me. 
 Special agent Briggs. 
 "Agent"? 
 We have a lot to discuss. 
 You're no longer a suspect. 
 We have proof that Rafael Cortes, aka Jangles, aka  El hombre llave,  killed Juan Badillo. 
 Wow. 
 That's amazing. How? 
 Discovered the origin of his infamous keys. 
 They're trophies. 
 You mean he'd kill someone and then take a key as a trophy? 
 This one is to Juan's front door. 
 This is to the original safe house. 
 You guys called it the estate. 
 Lisa's room key. 
 He killed them? 
 It's looking that way. 
 And now this. 
 I know you were investigating Odin Rossi. 
 This is Anthony Busca. 
 Don't know much about him, but we've had hits in South America of him using a phone we've linked to Odin. 
 South America? 
 Where'd you pick up the calls? 
 Can we get a map of Ecuador in here, please? 
 Need a ride? 
 Yeah. 
 Oh. [Sighs] 
 How you doing, Chuck? 
 Not good. 
 Yeah. 
 I screwed up big-time. 
 Charlie, don't. 
 No, I... 
 I put all my trust in him... 
 And not you. 
 I can't even look at you. 
 [Crying] Paul... 
 I'm gonna turn in my badge. 
 No. No! 
 No, look, I need you, Charlie. 
 The house needs you. You can't do that. 
 [Inhales deeply] 
 How can I trust myself? 
 I got things so wrong. 
 Can you ever forgive me? 
 Sorry. 
 I'm sorry too. 
 [Sniffles, inhales deeply] 
 [Door closes] 
 [Sighs] 
 I wouldn't sigh just yet. You haven't seen your room. 
 [Chuckles] 
 Let me guess. They seized all my stuff. 
 Everything. 
 Look who it is. 
 Yeah, man. 
 What's up? 
 Did you hear? 
 Yeah. 
 An innocent man. Mmhmm. 
 Mike filled us in. 
 So, uh, where is everybody? 
 Bonfire. 
 You should join them. 
 It'd be nice for us to be together again. 
 Charlie, why don't you go ahead? 
 I'm gonna steal Briggs for a minute. 
 You can help me with the cooler. 
 Yeah. 
 [Bottles clinking] 
 Is it done? 
 It is done. 
 And the recorder? 
 Who knows? 
 So we're even? 
 Oh, more than, brother man. 
 Good. 
 Now fix this place. 
 Look what I found. 
 Yo... 
 Little Simba returning to pride rock. 
 Yo, what's up, bro? How you doing? 
 [Grunts] Good to have you back, man. 
 Good to be back. 
 You know, guys, there's not a set of faces in the world that make me as happy as these. 
 [Clears throat] Five years ago... 
 I had poison pumped into my veins. 
 I'll tell you what... you think you're strong, but that drug will turn you into its bitch so fast. 
 It'll take your sleep. It'll take your joy. 
 It'll take your friends and your lovers and the best of what you are. 
 I forgot about home. 
 I'm sorry. 
 To home and the people that matter. 
 Yeah. 
 Cheers. 
 Home. 
 Hmm. 
 You know, Briggs, I think after you got hit in the head, it's turned you a little soft. 
 [Laughter, overlapping comments] 
 I could stand to lose a few edges... that's true. 
 Hey, hey. I want to make one more toast. 
 Okay, no. Shh. Johnny. 
 To Mike... 
 And his return to his dream on the east coast. 
 We are going to miss you. 
 I love you, Mikey, man. 
 Levi. 
 Yeah. 
 Somebody break out the bounce house. 
 [Laughter] 
 [Airplane engine roaring] 
 So how many boots on the ground? 
 Ten agents total, sir... 
 Delray's team and a tech-ops group from Langley. 
 What's the plan? 
 Our best option is to base in the hill above Jaco's city center with an op house in town. 
 Do we have those layouts? 
 Yes, sir. 
 What we're looking at here is the main access road. 
 What does target number one look like? 
 Whoo! 
 A skinny Churchill. 
 [Laughs] 
 A skinny Churchill... I can't picture this. 
 Oh, come on, boy. Hey. 
 He's got a cigar. 
 Forget it, forget it. 
 Once we're set up, can they jam us? 
 You can't have electronic countermeasures without a dish. 
 There's not a single dish in town. 
 Get off! 
 He's right. That's concertina wire. 
 I want it checked out. What do you think, Mike? 
 It's a good plan, but I'd consider moving our base above this switchback. 
 It's good access to both roads, it's better cover, and from there, you can see all approaches. 
 Smart kid. Move it up the hill. 
 [Keys clacking] 
 [Phone vibrates] 
 [Clears throat] Agent Briggs. 
 Mikey Mike. I miss you, man. 
 How's the world of power and monuments treating you, huh? 
 It's good. How about you? 
 Uh, you know me, man... just thinking about good times. 
 You're looking for me, right? 
 This place burned because of us. 
 My man. How's the house? 
 Good. Good. Everybody's good, you know. 
 It kind of feels like we're missing a musketeer, though. 
 You lit the match! 
 Stay back. 
 Guns now? 
 [Gunshot] 
 Listen, um... 
 I thought about taking a vacation. 
 Yeah. [Laughs] 
 You serious? 
 Yeah. 
 [Sighs] Listen, Mike, I haven't told anyone else about this, and I want you to stay calm.
