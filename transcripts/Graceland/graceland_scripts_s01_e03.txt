 Previously on  Graceland... 
 You know about Donnie. 
 But he ain't coming back. 
 Nyet! 
 [Gunshot] [Grunts] 
 So you give away my room yet? 
 It's not Graceland without you. 
 [Laughs] Mr. Mikey. 
 Psych order from the bureau. 
 Go. Everybody on our island of misfit toys could use a little head shrinking. 
 Call me Juan. 
 You're not a shrink, are you? 
 No, I'm your control officer for your investigation into Paul Briggs. 
 Get close to him. Become his friend. 
 I'm your guy. 
 Jakes just scored 1,000 armor-piercing bullets. 
 You tell Bello that you've got a guy at camp Pendleton with bullets... a marine. 
 That'd be you. 
 I've got the look, right? 
 I thought about it. Your plan's awesome. 
 We got a deal? 
 Yes, we have a deal. 
 You know what a heat run is? 
 A heat run is when someone makes a series of random turns and speed changes in order to avoid a tail. 
 Our boy Eddie, he just bought $1/2 million in illegal ammo. 
 He always makes the same exact heat run. 
 You know where he's going. 
 There they are. [Tires screech] 
 You ready to meet Bello? 
 [Switch flicks] 
 [Cocks pistol] 
 Who you been talking to? 
 No one. 
 Uh, uh, uh. 
 Hmm. 
 Who? 
 Put the guns down, Paul. 
 Today is not a good day to die. 
 Bello. 
 I know... I feel like we've met. 
 Eddie has said so much about you. 
 All good, I'm sure. 
 Why did you pull your gun on your friend? 
 We heard your crew got jacked by Bobby moi. 
 Huh. 
 And then, all of a sudden, you request a meeting. 
 We walk in here, and I see your boys pointing heat in this direction, light bulb... you think one of us had something to do with it. 
 You're a quick thinker. 
 I didn't sell you out, Bello. 
 The only new face around here is that one. 
 Oh, no, no, no, no, no. 
 I didn't say anything to anybody. 
 Shut your rat mouth! 
 I'm not taking a bullet for you. 
 Mike, talk to me. Save your life. 
 Okay, we made the buy with Eddie... 
 And then I went right back to base, that's it. 
 You don't believe me, you can call my quartermaster, Henry Friedler. 
 He'll tell you the exact time that I signed back in. 
 Yes, my friend. 
 Does anyone have the number for the marines? 
 [Chuckles] Okay, okay, listen. 
 I didn't rat anybody out. 
 Or maybe you followed these guys after the buy, and then told Bobby their location, huh? 
 Well... How could I follow 'em? 
 Don't you think Eddie would spot a tail? 
 You shut up, army boy! 
 Eddie... 
 When you left the buy to bring the cargo to me, did you do a heat run? 
 Of course I did. 
 So you did all those tricky turns, the backtrack... you did all of that? 
 I always do! 
 Then how could Bobby's crew know? 
 How did anyone know where you would be? 
 Light the stove. 
 What is the key ingredient in a bullet, Mike? 
 Lead, sir. 
 That's right. 
 Set your gun down, Eddie. 
 Don't move away from him. Point your guns now. 
 Bello, I would never betray you. 
 Mike, Paul... 
 This may prove to be an internal matter after all. 
 Huh? 
 Look, we got off to the wrong foot. 
 But that is the past. Get their guns off the floor. 
 [Clicks chamber open, closed] 
 I hear you're pretty handy with this thing. 
 I am. 
 [Chuckles] 
 [Snaps empty chamber] 
 Aah! 
 Oh, my God, that was intense, huh, Mikey? 
 Yeah, that was intense. That was insane. 
 I'm sweating everywhere. Ah, baby, just breathe. 
 We cracked the top rung, baby. We are partying with the boss. 
 Huh? Bello. 
 You put a gun to my head. 
 Two guns, actually, and you rolled with it. 
 You played the part like Brando, man. 
 You know? You had me nervous there for, like, a nanosecond, but then you dropped that camp Pendleton thing. 
 What? Who the hell is Henry Friedler? 
 He's my high school football coach. 
 [Laughs] Your high school... your high school football coach. My God, man. 
 And then the way you turned it around on him. 
 You know? Like a pro. 
 Hell of an instinct, Mikey. You showed me a lot back there. 
 You really did. I think I'm gonna be sick. 
 You gotta pull over. Nah, nah. Kill that noise. 
 Stand up. What? 
 Stand up and scream your lungs out. 
 Do it right now. Do it. It works. 
 Do it! 
 Whoo! 
 Oh, yeah, yeah. 
 [Nervous grunts] 
 [Both laugh] 
 You feel that? Huh? 
 Yeah. 
 Me too, man. Me too. 
 I mean, we couldn't have drawn it up any better. 
 You know, the way I tossed you that dish about the heat run, you just took it to the hoop like a white lebron. 
 Yeah! 
 Yeah, I did. 
 I thought you were gonna kill me. 
 Yeah. [Chuckles] 
 When I asked you who you were talking to, what were you gonna say? 
 Oh, I was just, uh... 
 I was just making it up as I go along. 
 I was just... I was just making it up, man. 
 Making it up. [Chuckles] 
 You rocked it. 
 You rocked it, special agent Michael Warren. 
 [Electronic music] 
 ♪ ♪ 
 Okay, kids, I got some zombie virus. 
 Makes you real calm real fast. 
 Hey, hey, listen. 
 Don't ask me what's in it. 
 I'm already calm. 
 Yo, you just had a gun to your head, okay? 
 Don't take away our excuse to drink the zombie. 
 [Laughs] 
 Yeah, don't be selfish. 
 Jakes. Come here, sunshine. 
 Don't call me sunshine. [Laughter] 
 Yo, to living, lying, and loving. 
 Cheers. 
 To living. 
 [Chuckles] So good. 
 Oh, we should call this crap "amnesia." 
 I forget it tastes like that. That sh1t is foul. 
 That is really, truly foul. 
 Yeah. 
 Come on, one more round. 
 [Laughter] 
 Ah... I know that bracelet. 
 Alina wears it, right? 
 Mmhmm. 
 I thought you were shutting down your cover with the Russians. 
 I've got a week to wrap things up. 
 Mmhmm. 
 You heard that Donnie got transferred to Miami, right? 
 It's a good fit for him. The hell it is. 
 Kusmanov wants Donnie dead. 
 Well, duh. We arrested his brother. 
 That's what happens. 
 Yeah, but it's not the whole Russian mafia that wants him dead, it's just Kusmanov. 
 So what, you think you take Kuz down, somehow Donnie comes back? 
 Mmhmm. 
 This is beyond our control, Lauren. 
 Look, Kusmanov has something planned for tomorrow. 
 I was with him tonight. 
 500. 
 Come on, Kusmanov, what, are you trying to get your brother out of prison in one poker hand? 
 I don't need money to kill that b*st*rd agent who set him up. 
 I may have something in the works. 
 It's big. 
 Yeah, yeah. 
 Okay, what's your play? 
 [Cell phone ringing] 
 Really? Another Booty call, huh? 
 Ugh. Not even close. C.I. 
 Coitus Interruptus. 
 [Laughter] 
 It's Whistler. He's a pain in the ass. 
 No, he's not. He's just a little needy. 
 Whistler? 
 Yeah, he's a meth head. 
 He used to wheeze a lot. He works for me now. 
 All right, guys, I gotta skip this little party. 
 No, no, no, no, no. Take this one shot with you. 
 No, I'm good, I'm good. 
 Charlie... 
 Gotta make this call. 
 Whoa. 
 Hey. 
 Hey, zombies? Hey, guys. 
 Hey, man. 
 Yo, Briggs. 
 I'm about to hit the bar, man. 
 I'm looking to get into some trouble, dude. 
 No, you're not. 
 I am. 
 Come on, dude, I need backup. Let's go. 
 No. I need all my FBI guys. 
 We got action tomorrow, bro. 
 Just FBI? 
 Yeah. 
 Yeah, you and Paige have at it. Represent, huh? 
 You know what? I'm good. 
 I'm gonna watch  the town  again. Ah. 
 Paige, you in? 
 What's up? 
 Kusmanov's making a move. 
 What, is that the brother of the guy we arrested? 
 Mmhmm. 
 He wants to kill Donnie. 
 What's the play? 
 The Russians are gonna grab a couple of Lamborghinis. 
 Yeah, they embed 'em with lojacks, they sell 'em on the black market, find 'em, steal 'em right back. 
 Our girl Lauren here happens to know where these cars are coming through tomorrow. 
 Yo, we should have one toast for Donnie, though, right, yeah? 
 It's bedtime, John boy. You gotta be up at 6:00 A.M. 
 To go get warrants from Judge Feldman. 
 Buenas noches.  Sweet dreams. 
 Wow, Briggs pulled your own gun on you? 
 Always a new experience with Briggs. 
 Did he cock it? 
 Oh, yeah. 
 Briggs doesn't do anything halfway. 
 So how is your relationship with him? 
 Great. We got the job done, we snagged an extra million dollars for the bureau, and I helped him get in with Bello. 
 You tell me that, but I gotta say your report's a little slim. 
 What do I gotta do to get you to open up, pull a knife on you? 
 You guys drag me 3,000 Miles from where I'm supposed to be, ask me to investigate my roommate, and no one is telling me why. 
 You want something specific. 
 God's in the details. 
 I've heard that. And so is the devil. 
 [Sighs] 
 Do you know how much Briggs makes in a year? 
 It's not a lot. 
 So how does he live? Is he... is he tossing around greenbacks, expensive clothes, new roller blades? 
 You think he's skimming cash? 
 You live with him. You tell me. 
 And, uh, your report... 
 More of those godly details, please. 
 All due respect, I'm writing an undercover report of my roommate in our house. 
 I've gotta write fast. 
 So spend some time in Starbucks. 
 It's California. Lots of writers there. 
 Say you're working on a screenplay about an undercover agent's quest to make it back home to D.C. 
 [Chuckles] 
 [Door shuts] 
 [File rasping] 
 Hey, Charlie. 
 Hey, Whistler. 
 Ah, I'm sorry... 
 It's all good. 
 You gotta see what I'm doing. 
 I've seen it before. 
 You've been working on it for months. 
 Almost done. Audrey, she's six... or five... She's six. 
 Yeah. Check out the grand entrance here. 
 Oh, that's amazing. 
 Yeah. 
 And these... these columns are exactly like I had on the mayor's mansion back in '98. 
 If you're ever in hancock park, you gotta check 'em out. 
 Yeah, when he gives me a call, I'll check 'em out. 
 [Chuckles] 
 What's up? 
 What was the urgent text about? 
 And I got a whole four-post bed right here. 
 This is like my daughter's room exactly was. 
 I built the whole thing. 
 You would have loved that house. 
 I'm sure it was beautiful, and I'm sorry it's gone, but what's up? Come on. 
 What do you got for me? 
 I got a score, Charlie. Sam Cotonio. 
 Wow. I like the sound of that. What about him? 
 That meth bust out in chino last month? 
 Yeah. 
 That was headed for Sam. 
 He's desperate right now, and a supplier needs product. 
 He knows me. 
 I'll tell Sam we can hook him up. 
 You know this guy. He's a big player. 
 You're gonna get him off the street. 
 You high right now? 
 Look at me. What are you on? 
 I'm not high. I'm not hi... you think I could do this kind of woodwork if I was high? 
 Look it. On Audrey's life... 
 All right. All right. 
 I swear I'm good. 
 And this thing with Sam, it's real. 
 This is a serious takedown, Charlie. 
 Set it up. 
 So my usual 20%? 
 Yeah. 
 It's just, I think, you know, he's kind of a kingpin, and 25% is a bit more reasonable. 
 It's 20%. That's what the government pays, and it's plenty of money. 
 I just... I need the cash now. 
 She's kicking me out. I gotta find a place. 
 Oh, that's too bad. 
 She's not too thrilled about having a meth addict in her garage, huh? 
 I screwed everything up, okay? 
 I mean, I wish I could turn back the clock. 
 But you can't. 
 No. 
 So focus on this fantastic Dollhouse that you're so great at. 
 Make it beautiful and give it to your sister, and she'll be happy. 
 You're right, Charlie. 
 All right? 
 Can you stay out of trouble, please... For me? 
 Okay, Charlie. For you. 
 Okay. 
 Be good. 
 All right, guys, let's test out these spike strips, huh? 
 Yeah, that truck's not going anywhere after that. 
 Johnny, you guys all set up over there? 
 Wellrested and not hungover. 
 I'm so clear it hurts, bro. 
 Lauren, this better be worth it. 
 Oh, it'll be worth it. 
 We've spotted the truck... a half a mile away and closing. 
 Okay, kids, our target is closing. 
 Let's rip some rubber. 
 Clocking him at 75. 
 That's fast. 
 Yeah, it's way too fast for a truck carrying a pair of Lambos. 
 That suspension's not compressed. 
 Yeah, he's riding way too high. 
 There's no way there's cars in there. 
 No, no, no, they're in there, Paul. 
 No, he's right. Those axles are too high. 
 Johnny, kill the mission. Kill it right now. Abort. 
 Copy that. Copy that. Abort! 
 Don't do this. 
 There's nothing in that truck, Lauren. 
 Are you out of your mind? Don't touch that again. 
 Abort the mission. Abort the mission. 
 L... Lauren! 
 Don't do it. Get back here. 
 Don't. 
 Is she crazy? 
 Lauren, get back. Get out of the road. 
 [Truck horn honking] 
 [Tires screeching] 
 And we're screwed. 
 DEA. 
 Get out of the cab and put your hands in the air. 
 Johnny, back her up. 
 Okay, go, guys. Go, go, go, go, go! 
 I don't see anyone else in the truck. 
 Get him out of the truck! 
 Go, go, go, go, go! Somebody get the back. 
 I'm on it. I'm on it. 
 Hands up! Hands up! Hands up! Hands up! 
 [Sighs] 
 Well, we probably won't even need the chompers for this. 
 I bet this damn thing isn't even locked. 
 Well, what do you know? 
 He must have changed the dates. 
 Look, I'll go back to Kusmanov, and I will talk to him, and I will find out... 
 Lauren, you're done. Okay? 
 Kusmanov's driver saw your face. 
 He knows you're DEA now. 
 So we hold him for 24 hours. 
 Hold him for what, driving an empty truck? 
 He's gonna go straight back to Kusmanov, and he's gonna tell him that some crazy woman flashing a DEA badge jumped in front of his  empty truck! 
 I'll fix this. 
 There's no fixing this. 
 Alina no longer exists. 
 This is life or death now. 
 You choose. 
 [Truck door shuts] 
 I mean, Lauren, man, she just... she went crazy. 
 She ran right out in front of that truck. 
 I've never seen Briggs so pissed off in my life... ever. 
 I mean, not even when you screw up. 
 Where is he, by the way? You know Briggs, man. 
 He's meditating this into the universe. 
 He'll be back when he achieves total inner peace. 
 Blah, blah, Briggs. Whatever. Look, time to explain to Mikey here the subtleties of undercover dating. 
 You cannot break your cover. I'm serious. 
 I get it. 
 Do you? 
 Yeah. 
 You can never walk up to a woman and say, "hi, I'm special agent Mike Warren. 
 I work undercover for the FBI." 
 Which is too bad because that's one hell of a pickup line. [Laughter] 
 So who are you tonight? 
 Well, that depends on who's here. 
 Your boy Phil is over there. 
 Slowly, slowly, slowly, slow... 
 [Laughs] 
 [Laughter] Phil thinks I'm a pharmaceutical rep. 
 Ask me why I chose that for him. 
 Why'd you choose that for Phil? 
 Look at him. 
 Does he look like a cardiologist to you? 
 Okay, you pick an alias they would know nothing about. 
 So they don't ask too many questions, and they don't find out what they shouldn't, right, right. 
 What about you? Hmm? 
 I'm a pilot. 
 You're just always a pilot? 
 Always. 
 Unless... unless I meet a flight attendant, like that one time. 
 Then I'm a photographer. Hmm. 
 Oh, my... You're stunning. 
 Me? 
 I'm serious. 
 I mean, I gotta get you in front of my lens. 
 Oh, my God. 
 It works every time. 
 Get outta here, man. [Laughter] 
 Every time, like clockwork, son. 
 I play bass in a band you've never heard of. 
 We travel a lot. We've never recorded an album, and we never will. 
 Chicks dig artists. Even starving artists? 
 When they look like me, they do. 
 I'm like a chocolate Jesus. [Laughter] 
 Watch and learn, my young friend. 
 That dude plays the same three chords every time. 
 Over and over... And over and over and over again. 
 [Chuckles] 
 I swear, it's true. 
 The more I drink, the better and better I get. 
 
 
 
 [Door opens] 
 God damn, Alina. 
 Aw, jumpy? 
 [Sighs] 
 Everybody is. The FBI and DEA hit us today. 
 What? Where? 
 They got nothing. 
 Viktor got stopped by some crazy DEA chick right in the middle of the road. 
 So the lamborghini thing is off? 
 Nothing's off. Screw the FBI. 
 The cars stay in woodland hills until we figure this out. 
 No poker tonight. 
 No. 
 We're going to grab Chinese. You hungry? 
 Ah, I just ate. 
 Poker soon? Sure. 
 I love to take your money. [Chuckles] 
 Hey, Viktor... 
 Nice ass. 
 [Chuckles] 
 I'm trying to make it on the PGA tour. 
 Right now, I'm teaching privately to make ends meet. 
 That's so great. So you play at spyglass, right? 
 Spyglass, many times. 
 Old spyglass, right? Yes. 
 My dad is a huge golfer. 
 I practically grew up there. 
 Paul! Over here. 
 What's wrong? 
 See that guy who just walked in? 
 Oh, nice of you to join us. 
 He's an astronaut. 
 He was the last guy to ride in the  endeavor. 
 That's incredible. [Chuckles] 
 Why... why are you hiding from him? 
 [Sighs] I kinda gave him a wrong number. 
 I'm really sorry, I gotta go. 
 Thanks for the drink. 
 Can I have my tab? 
 Oh, actually, that guy right over there already paid for your drinks. 
 Hmm. 
 But charge what you want, my man Paul is paying for all this. 
 You know it. 
 Pardon me. 
 Ahh. 
 Smartest thing you could have said. 
 Mikey, what's up, man? 
 Yeah, her dad was a golfer. 
 [Laughter] 
 Hey, thanks for the drinks, Captain Lightyear. 
 An astronaut? Really? 
 Yeah. 
 Well, you know, didn't end well. 
 I never called her. [Chuckles] 
 All right, let's get you back up on that horse. 
 Come on. Kid's in for a long night. 
 Make me proud, son. 
 Very high quality. 
 Very pure. 
 I told you, it's not the blue, but it is serious. 
 $500,000 for 50 pounds. That's the deal. 
 Let me see the money. 
 Okay, we wait for the "go" word. 
 Hold on. 
 With all these... with all these busts going down, supply is short. What is the little twit doing? 
 Am I right or am I right? 
 He's trying to Jack up the price to increase his cut. 
 It seems a little low, given present market conditions. 
 I mean, it's worth discussing. 
 You renegotiate now? 
 It's $500,000, all right? 
 Let's just do this thing already. 
 The pay seems low, the quality is high, and we're the only game in town. You know what? 
 You guys can piss off. 
 Wait, wait. No, no, no. Forget Whistler. 
 He doesn't know a good thing when it's right in front of him. 
 It's $500,000. 
 Fine. Your friend shuts up, we have a deal. 
 Great. Let's just zip it up, and everybody's happy. Okay, that's our signal. 
 Go, go, go, go, go! 
 Hands... get your hands up! 
 Hands up! Nobody move! 
 Hands up! Hands up! You set me up? 
 You set me up! 
 You set me up? 
 You set me up, I'll kill you! 
 I know people. 
 On the car! Hood of the car! 
 Hood of the car! I'll kill you. 
 You're a nitwit, you know that? 
 I was just playing. 
 You were just playing? 
 We got the bad guy. We're good, right? 
 When do I get my money? Your money? 
 I'm gonna shove your money up your ass. 
 Where you been all night? 
 Don't worry about it. 
 No, I'm worried about it. Come here. 
 I... I'm just tired, Briggs. I need some sleep. 
 Hey... Who did that to you? 
 Hmm? Talk to me, kiddo. 
 Kusmanov. 
 I'm an idiot. I went to the warehouse in woodland hills to see if the cars were there, and he caught me snooping around. 
 And I guess he needed a punching bag? 
 I'll be fine. 
 I'm sorry, Paul. I just... 
 I just had to know I wasn't crazy. 
 And were they there? 
 Did you see the lojacked cars in the warehouse? 
 Yeah. 
 All right. Where's Kusmanov? 
 [Indistinct chatter] 
 [Chuckles] 
 He's inside. 
 The Dollhouse looks great. 
 [Television chatter] 
 I finished the Dollhouse. 
 I see that. 
 Are you high? 
 Just celebrating. 
 My sister's still kicking me out. 
 Whistler... 
 I can't use you as a C.I. anymore. 
 W... what do you mean? 
 My supervisor said you're too risky and that I can't use you anymore. 
 What am I supposed to do? 
 You're gonna get your sh1t together, go to a rehab or a clinic or something. 
 No, rehab doesn't work. I told you that. 
 It works for a lot of people. 
 It doesn't work for me. 
 I gotta be... Doing stuff. 
 They just  talk  about stuff. It's a total waste of time. 
 What am I supposed to do? I'm totally screwed! 
 Screwed? You're getting a check for $100,000. 
 That's the opposite of screwed. 
 What am I supposed to do without you, Charlie? 
 You gotta grow up, man. 
 Can I get my check soon? 
 Tomorrow. 
 Charlie... 
 Did you at least fight for me? 
 I gave it all I had. 
 All right, we're gonna hit it from the north entrance, I.D. the cars and ziptie some ruskies. 
 Good? Where's Briggs? 
 Don't worry about it. 
 Now, Lauren, you said there's three or four guys in there, right? Yeah. 
 You're sure? 
 Yeah. 
 Hey, levi. 
 Hmm. 
 You sure you're ready to run comm on a bust? 
 Hmm. This is the stuff that Quantico actually trained me for. 
 Just keep us safe, Mikey. 
 You got it. 
 Let's do some damage. 
 Let's hit it. 
 Man, get your hands out of here. 
 Go ahead now. 
 Take these guys down before they know what hit 'em. 
 Let's do it, boys. 
 Own! 
 [Gunfire] 
 There's a lot more than four guys in here. 
 Get me out of here, Mike. 
 All right, it's all clear behind you. 
 I want you to fall back behind those pipes. 
 Hey, pull back! Pull back! 
 You two that way, you come around with me. 
 We gotta flank 'em from both sides. 
 [Gunfire] 
 [Agents shouting] 
 [Gunshots] 
 [Grunting] 
 [Slash, fabric tears] 
 [Gunshot] 
 Chocolate Jesus. I'm a believer, bro. 
 I thought she said there was four. 
 I know. She can't count or what? 
 Nice cars, dickheads. 
 Didn't your mother ever tell you speed kills? 
 How's the arm? 
 He sliced me like a friggin' mango, man. 
 It's all right, though. 
 Good story for the girlies tonight. 
 Kusmanov. How you been? Life good? 
 [Scoffs] 
 Why don't you come with me? 
 Why am I not going with them? 
 Because you're special. 
 Is that you, Dmitri? 
 Who are you? 
 Well, that doesn't really much matter, now does it? 
 Because as far as anyone else is concerned, I was never here. 
 This is hardly a fair fight. 
 Fair fight? 
 Yeah, now that's something you'd know a thing or two about, now, isn't it? 
 Was it a fair fight for her? 
 What are you talking about? 
 You're crazy. [Grunts] 
 You have a good night. 
 [Laughter] 
 [Speaks spanish] 
 What's up, B? 
 We need to toast to the madness that was today. 
 Madness, huh? 
 B, check it out. 
 I got sliced up by this mad Russian. 
 I got this dope scar, though. I'm working it tonight. 
 Yeah, that looks pretty serious, John. 
 Thank you. 
 Where's Lauren? 
 She said she wasn't up for it. 
 Not up for it? 
 Well, then, I guess we gotta party on her behalf, huh? 
 What are we drinking? 
 White Russians. 
 All right. 
 Whoa whoa! 
 To the bar. 
 Word up. Let's do it. 
 Hey, look, come here. 
 Okay, don't look now, but there is a pretty girl at the bar that has been staring at you all night. 
 [Giggles] 
 [Sighs] 
 Go get her. 
 It's been a crazy day. 
 I don't feel like creating some elaborate lie right now. 
 Can I just be myself and hang with you guys? 
 All right? 
 Well, I want to hook up with someone, and that's not gonna happen with you beside me, so... Hold that. 
 She... She... no, no, no, no, no. 
 Uh-uh, that is not cool... Okay. 
 [Irritated laugh] 
 [Laughs] 
 Hi. 
 I'm Abby. It's nice to meet you, Mike. 
 I'm Mike, yeah. 
 Hey, ladies. 
 No, no, no. No touching. 
 Back up. Back up. 
 No. 
 My man, why don't you take a walk, bro? 
 Free country, chief. 
 I'll have a madras, please. 
 Madras? Where you from? 
 Baltimore. 
 Virginia. Make it two. 
 Thanks. 
 Come on... 
 Get out of my face! 
 Yo, man, you just don't know when to stop. 
 Whoa, whoa, whoa. Hey! Hey! Paul! 
 Hey! Oh, dude, you got this, man? 
 You are out of here. Paul, home! Now. 
 Those your friends? 
 Yeah. 
 Looks like a nice group. 
 Yes. 
 You want to tell me what that was about? 
 The guy needed a Buddhist beatdown. 
 Something going on in that tortured head of yours? 
 The driver of the Russian truck. 
 The one that Lauren tried to arrest the other day. 
 Jakes said he saw him at the warehouse today. 
 So what are you saying? He saw Lauren? 
 I'm just... I'm trying to add things up. 
 Lauren goes to the warehouse. 
 Kusmanov catches her and beats her up. 
 If the driver saw her, she'd be dead, not bruised. 
 Would she be dead? 
 Maybe they didn't want to kill a fed. 
 All right. But why let her go? 
 The lojacks they put on those cars... they could have just as easily put one on Lauren. 
 They could. 
 That's it, isn't it? 
 I mean, they left her alive so that they could track her and find out how much she knows about the operation. 
 Yeah, it feels right. 
 And if the Russians are tracking Lauren, she is leading them straight back here. 
 Hey, wait. Where are you going with this? 
 When Lauren gets home, I have to find out. 
 I have to tell the DEA. 
 Uh... All right, there's something I'm not understanding here. 
 Okay. 
 So you go to Wellesley... Georgetown law, which... let me just say, that is a very impressive education, by the way. 
 I coasted. Didn't do a lick of work. 
 You're a liar. 
 I am. 
 [Laughter] 
 So why aren't you taking the bar this summer? 
 My dad told me not to. 
 I've been going nonstop since I was nine, so he told me to take a summer off. 
 Go to the pacific ocean, stick my toe in the water. 
 Do and see life... 
 Before I get locked in an office forever. 
 [Chuckles] Can I ask you something? 
 When my friend Paige came up to you at the bar, what did she say to you? 
 She said, "that guy is Mike", and of all of the guys in the bar, he's real." 
 Are you real, Mike? 
 [Sighs] 
 Hey, good morning. 
 Wanna play frisbee? 
 Actually, no. 
 I haven't slept yet. I'm kinda tired. 
 I wanna hear about your s*x life, but not right now. 
 We have important things to do. Seriously? 
 There's something we need to go look for. 
 We were supposed to go right back there. 
 The bank is that way. We're not going to the bank. 
 We're getting my check, right? 
 Are we making a buy? 
 No. Not with me, you're not. 
 What are we doing here? 
 Get out of the car. 
 What's going on, Charlie? 
 You like this place? 
 It's okay. 
 You know, this house can be yours. 
 [Chuckles] 
 They're not gonna sell it to somebody like me. 
 Yeah, well, I talked to a realtor, pulled some strings. 
 I can't afford it. 
 Yeah, you can. 
 This would be a lot of work. 
 Wasn't the mayor's house a lot of work? 
 Come on, let's go see the inside. 
 Oops, sorry. 
 Nice shot. 
 That was terrible. 
 Good morning. You got it? 
 They're tracking Lauren. 
 Not exactly the mayor's mansion. 
 You're not exactly the mayor. 
 But you are a crazy-talented carpenter, and I feel like you could make something really beautiful out of this place. 
 This... This is actually no problem. 
 This is no problem. 
 And these... these are gonna be original. 
 I wouldn't even touch these. 
 And that room back there, that gets Southern exposure. 
 I'd just knock that wall out, put in French doors out to the yard. 
 Do not play with me, Charlie. 
 Here's the realtor's card. He's expecting your call. 
 The house is already off the market. 
 All you gotta do is sign the papers and give 'em this. 
 My check. 
 Your check. 
 Make this my den. 
 [Chuckles] 
 Put a little entertainment center in. 
 [Exhales] 
 These are built-ins? 
 Yeah. 
 May even get some books. 
 Whistler, make sure you call 'em. 
 Just give 'em the check, and the house is yours. 
 Oh... Sit by the fire. 
 [Laughs] I could see that. 
 Paige is unbelievable. 
 The DEA is kicking me out of Graceland. 
 Paige didn't do that to you. 
 It's a self-inflicted wound, Lauren. 
 You're damn lucky you didn't make a splatter pattern out of your entire career, that's for damn sure. 
 She found a goddamn GPS tracker under your car. 
 Do you understand how lucky we are that damn thing didn't transmit, huh? 
 If they'd recovered it before Paige found it, Graceland would be done. It wasn't transmitting, and they didn't find it first, so there's no reason to kick me out of the house. 
 Uh, you went back to Kusmanov's when you weren't supposed to. 
 Please, come on, Paul. You've got to fight this for me. 
 Hell no. You lied to me. 
 I don't go to bat for liars, Lauren. 
 You never went to that warehouse, you never saw those cars. 
 You didn't know how many goddamn Russians were in there because you were never there. 
 You almost got Johnny killed. 
 You put this whole house in harm's way, and you know what the worst part is? 
 You used me. 
 You played... Me. 
 Kusmanov never hit you. 
 That's right. I saw his hands. 
 Lauren, they were as smooth as butter. 
 This is what a hand looks like when you hit someone. 
 So come on, tell me the whole truth. 
 Who did hit you? What's the going rate to have some lowlife take a swing at your face? 
 I did it for Donnie. 
 Kusmanov was going to kill him. I had to do something. 
 Yeah. 
 You mean you had to get me to do something. 
 Look, Lauren... 
 You should take this as a blessing, a lesson. 
 All is not lost. You're still DEA. 
 Look, put in for a transfer. 
 Who knows? You might get lucky. 
 They may give you to Miami. 
 I know there's one agent down there who'll be very happy to see you. 
 Okay... 
 [Rock music] 
 ♪ ♪ 
 Yeah, I think I remember him. 
 He bought this. Cash. 
 GPS tracker. 
 [Knock at door, door opens] 
 Hey, what's up? 
 Guess I'm still a little upset about this whole Lauren thing. 
 Yeah, everyone is. 
 I mean, I was right there when Paige pulled the transmitter off her car. 
 Oh, yeah. The frisbee move was cute. 
 The thing is, these Russians are really sophisticated with their GPS trackers. 
 The one that we pulled off Lauren's jeep was just some... 
 It was just some off-the-counter job that wasn't even transmitting. 
 Hmm. 
 Well, who knows why the bad guys do the stupid sh1t they do, huh? 
 That's the thing, though. 
 I don't think these guys are that careless. 
 I think that somebody else put this tracker on Lauren's jeep. 
 [Chuckles] 
 [Sighs] Mike, I love Lauren. I do. 
 She's a great agent. 
 But she got reckless. She almost got Johnny killed. 
 And if she would have kept it up, she'd have burned this house. 
 In this line of work, there are people that you need to be able to trust... people that you love. 
 Sometimes those people let you down. 
 You're gonna like your new home. 
 When that happens in this job, they gotta go. 
 The takeaway here is that if you're gonna do this job right, dispassion, non-attachment, they're a must. 
 This house, this job... 
 You've gotta be bigger than that. 
 We  must come first. 
 Now what I did to Lauren, I'd do again in a heartbeat if it meant protecting Graceland. 
 I'd do it to you.
