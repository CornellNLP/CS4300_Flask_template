 major heart failure, he could be unconscious for a while yet.  
 DEB: (looks uncomfortable as she looks from the doctor to Dan.) Would it have

 you’ve been the assiest ass on the planet for the better part of our married lives.  
 DAN: (o.s) What are you doing?  
 DEB: I’m considering, Dan.  
 DAN: Please. (Struggling to breath.) Help me. (gasps once and then goes limp.)

 HALEY: You won’t.  
 (Nathan looks at her, debating whether to say something.)  
 HALEY: What?  
 NATHAN: Marry me.  
 HALEY: (smiles, embarrassed, thinking he’s joking.) Stop it.  
 NATHAN: What, would you?  
 HALEY: Oh you’re embarrassing me. (Sits up.)  
 NATHAN: Why not?  
 HALEY: Because…we’re in high school.  
 NATHAN: So what? I’m emancipated.  
 HALEY: Is this about s*x, because I wanna wait?  
 NATHAN: No, I can see you caving on that one already.  
 HALEY: (laughs) Well maybe so. Nathan, couples don’t get married in high school.  
 It’s just…it’s not normal.  
 NATHAN: So? I’m not normal. What I’m feeling is definitely not normal and to be  
 honest with you Haley, I don’t ever want to be normal. Not with you. (pause) I’m  
 serious.  
 HALEY: I know you are.  
 NATHAN: OK, so I’ll say it again. I could love you forever.

 LUCAS: Do you think my mom knows?  
 KEITH: I don’t know.  
 LUCAS: Think she cares?  
 KEITH: Do you? (Lucas doesn’t know how to respond.) You know Luke, Dan’s your  
 birth father and um…even though he’s never been in your life it wouldn’t be wrong  
 to be concerned.  
 LUCAS: Would it be wrong to hope he dies?  
 CUT TO:  
 [INT. TREE HILL HOSPITAL - DAN’S ROOM - DAY]  
 DOCTOR: (o.s) Dan has a heart condition known as HCM. It’s a genetic mutation and  
 causes the heart muscles to thicken…eventually; it prevents the heart from pumping blood.  
 DEB: But why now?  
 DOCTOR: (o.s) Sometimes cardiac arrest…is bought on by excessive physical activity,  
 even excessive stress.

 KAREN: Coach Durham?  
 WHITEY: (opens one eye immediately and laughs.) Karen. I always pretend to be  
 asleep when the nurse comes in here. She looks a lot like Death…only uglier.  
 KAREN: (laughs) How are you doing?  
 WHITEY: Ah you know, they want to…operate…but it’s a long story full of medical  
 mumbo jumbo.  
 KAREN: Well I’ve got lots of time. I closed the café for the day.  
 WHITEY: Huh…well…I guess your nest is feeling pretty empty huh?  
 KAREN: (Laughs sadly) I guess so.  
 WHITEY: You ever think, maybe that’s what Lucas wanted? You know, that silence  
 would close in on you and you’d have to go out and make some noise yourself.  
 KAREN: Well…I was thinking that maybe I’d take some classes over at the University.  
 WHITEY: Well stop thinking about it, damn it, and do it! You know what I’d do  
 if I was your age? (Karen shakes her head.) Everything…and then by golly, I’d  
 turn around and do it again. I wouldn’t give a rat’s ass who disapproved or what  
 I looked like doing it. (beat) Karen…take it from me…when you’re my age, you don’t  
 want to be here…tangled up in that road you never travelled. Make some time. (smiles)

 PEYTON: Yeah. At least it was until you started talking.  
 BROOKE: (laughs) So what do you want to do after this? I was thinking; maybe some  
 ice-cream, a little lingerie, facial.  
 PEYTON: It’s OK to miss him Brooke.  
 BROOKE: Miss who?  
 PEYTON: Lucas.  
 BROOKE: (lying) I don’t…miss him (pause) really, I mean maybe a little, you know,  
 now that he moved but (breathes deeply) whatever, there’s other fish in the sea.  
 We’ll find new boyfriends. It shouldn’t be hard considering you’re you and I’m me.  
 PEYTON: (laughs) Yeah. His loss. Jake’s too.  
 BROOKE: Wanna know a secret?  
 PEYTON: Hmm.  
 BROOKE: I was secretly pulling for you and Jake.  
 PEYTON: Even when I was at the top of your ‘Bitch List’?

 PEYTON: Why?  
 BROOKE: Coz I wasn’t into him. (Peyton and Brooke laugh.)  
 (A boat full of topless men roars past. Brooke and Peyton sit up on their elbows.

 into her bag and take out the letter from Lucas.) It was taped to my front door  
 yesterday.  
 BROOKE: (looking at it) This is from Lucas.  
 PEYTON: (nods) I’m sorry. I shouldn’t have hid it from you.  
 BROOKE: But you did. I’ve been carrying around the fact that he left without a word  
 and you’ve had the words the whole time and didn’t tell me?  
 PEYTON: I was going to.  
 BROOKE: When?! After you read it first?!

 front door this time?  
 HALEY: Mom.  
 NATHAN: I came in the front door Mrs James.  
 LYDIA JAMES: Atta boy. You hungry?  
 HALEY: Actually ah, can we just talk to you and dad?  
 LYDIA JAMES: Are you pregnant?  
 HALEY: (shocked) What!?  
 LYDIA JAMES: Pregnant, with child, bun in the oven.  
 HALEY: Mom!  
 MARION: Lydia stop. You know that Haley’s a virgin.  
 HALEY: (warning) Marion.  
 MARION: And it’s a damn shame if you ask me. (Looks pointed at Nathan. Nathan  
 doesn’t know whether to be pleased or discomfited.)  
 HALEY: (Turning back.) Can we just talk to you and dad. (Mouths ‘alone’.)  
 MARION: Alright, I can take a hint. (Picks up the newspaper.) Besides, your mother’s  
 going to tell me every word of it. (To Lydia.) Call me with the details Lydia. Lydia  
 winks.)  
 HALEY: (Mortified) Is dad here?  
 LYDIA JAMES: (Calling out of the window.) Jimmy! Kitchen! Haley’s pregnant! (Turns  
 back to them.) Shall we sit?  
 HALEY: I think we better.

 (Nathan and Haley walk into Dan’s hospital room.)  
 NURSE: Can I help you?  
 NATHAN: I’m his son. (Stands and looks at his father for a while, void of emotion.)  
 Is he going to die?  
 NURSE: (o.s) You should talk to your mom. I think she’s in the chapel.  
 CUT TO:  
 [INT. CHARLESTON - KEITH AND LUCAS’ APARTMENT - DAY]

 you were an ass, my new teaching job, we both get a fresh start, your mother and I  
 laid out my heart and this apartment has a killer view. So what else?  
 LUCAS: Nathan.  
 KEITH: (beat) Oh. Yeah, that marriage thing must have been tough for you. (Begins to  
 write Nathan on the box.)  
 LUCAS: No, I meant for reasons to go back. (Keith looks at him in confusion.) I was  
 wrong about him. He’s a good guy and…yeah, OK, him and Haley its, it’s kinda weird  
 but…I’m glad for them.  
 KEITH: (Smiles) You know Luke, I’m really proud of you for getting to know Nathan.  
 If you think you should go home…then you should but there are…things in Tree Hill  
 that I’m not sure I can face.  
 LUCAS: Like what?  
 KEITH: Just…something I’m not proud of. (beat) look um…I’m gonna take a little walk.  
 (Walks to the door.)  
 LUCAS: Keith!  
 KEITH: I’m good, I just uh…just gotta get a little air. (Shuts the door behind him.)

 [INT. TREE HILL HOSPITAL - CHAPEL - DAY]  
 (Deb is sitting at the front of the chapel, hunched over, with her head down. Nathan  
 and Haley walk in.)  
 NATHAN: (quietly) Mom.  
 DEB: Nathan. (Stands and hugs him.)  
 NATHAN: What happened?  
 DEB: Um, I found him in the beach house on the floor. I called 911 (pause) but they  
 said I might have called too late.  
 NATHAN: Mom, it’s not your fault.  
 DEB: Remember when you were little and you had to have your tonsils out? I came to  
 this chapel that night and sobbed because I had the worst feeling that something was  
 going to go wrong; that I was going to lose you.  
 NATHAN: You didn’t lose me mom.  
 HALEY: Yeah, we’re here for you Mrs Scott. Whatever you need. (Puts her hand on Deb’s  
 shoulder.)  
 DEB: (Pats Haley’s hand.) Thank you Haley. I guess I’m not ready to let go. (Looks  
 down at Haley’s hand and sees the wedding ring. She grabs Nathan’s hand and sees  
 his wedding ring too.)  
 NATHAN: We were ah…gonna tell you today.  
 DEB: Tell me what?  
 HALEY: I love your son very much Mrs Scott.  
 DEB: Tell me what, Nathan.  
 NATHAN: We got married.  
 DEB: (Laughs distressed) I must be losing my mind.  
 NATHAN: Listen mom, we’ll talk about it later. When dad’s well.  
 DEB: (o.s) When dad is well? Your father is unconscious Nathan, plus he may or may  
 not be my husband at this point, who the hell knows and now you’re telling me that  
 you got married? This has got to be a joke.  
 NATHAN: (shakes his head.) It’s not a joke mom.  
 HALEY: Mrs Scott, we’ve thought about-  
 DEB: Shut up Haley. (to Nathan) You did this to your father. You’re the reason he’s  
 here.  
 HALEY: Mrs Scott I-  
 DEB: I said shut up. Shut your selfish little mouth!  
 NATHAN: Mom! (Haley looks down upset.)  
 DEB: You walked away from him. (To Haley) And you helped him do it. You’re both to  
 blame. (Leaves the chapel.)  
 (Haley looks at Nathan. Deb stands in the hallway and cries. Karen comes round the  
 corner and sees her.)  
 KAREN: Deb, Deb what’s wrong? What happened?  
 DEB: (Sobbing) He’s gonna die.  
 KAREN: Who?  
 DEB: Dan. He had a heart attack.  
 KAREN: Oh my god! (Hugs Deb) Oh my god.

 DEB: Um hm.  
 KAREN: That…is not the Haley James that I know.  
 DEB: You mean the Haley Scott. I just, I-I-I don’t know whether to laugh or cry  
 or…throw up. I mean Dan’s in the hospital and Nathan is apparently married and Keith…  
 KAREN: Have you called him?  
 DEB: Yeah.  
 KAREN: Talk about your bad timing. Oh, it’s just it would be better if he were  
 here. Keith is good in a crisis.

 NATHAN: Hi Mr James.  
 JIMMY JAMES: Hello Nathan. Did you come in through the window?  
 LYDIA JAMES: He found the front door.  
 JIMMY JAMES: Nice work Nate. (Lydia smiles at them) So, to what do we owe this surprise?  
 HALEY: Well, we wanted to talk to you daddy.  
 (Lydia looks at Jimmy in surprise.)  
 JIMMY JAMES: (o.s) Daddy? This is gonna be expensive.  
 HALEY: (Closes, her eyes.) Ok, look. You guys know that I am an extremely cautious  
 person…and I consider things from every angle and I don’t just, like, jump into things.  
 LYDIA JAMES: Like getting to the point of this conversation?  
 NATHAN: Mr and Mrs James um… (stands up) as you know, I’m emancipated from my parents  
 and…I think you also know that I respect both of you very much-  
 JIMMY JAMES: I-I-I think I know where this is going and-and here’s the thing Nathan;  
 you see, if we adopt you, the making out with Haley is gonna have to stop. A-a-at  
 least in public.  
 HALEY: Could you guys be serious for like one minute of my life please?  
 (silence)  
 NATHAN: I’d like to marry your daughter.  
 (Lydia and Jimmy pause for two seconds and then burst out laughing. They stop at  
 the look of seriousness on both Haley and Nathan’s faces.)  
 JIMMY JAMES: I didn’t see that coming.  
 HALEY: (sad) Dad, mom-  
 LYDIA JAMES: I will discuss this with your father.  
 HALEY: You will?

 PEYTON: Brooke, wait up.  
 BROOKE: You shoulda told me about the letter Peyton.  
 PEYTON: I know.  
 BROOKE: Then why didn’t you? Why would you hide it from me?  
 PEYTON: Coz we were having fun again. (Brooke calms down slightly and contemplates.)  
 Brooke, having our friendship back has been really, really great. You know I…I figured  
 Lucas is gone so it didn’t matter what was in the letter because it was just gonna  
 come between us.  
 BROOKE: Why would you think that?  
 PEYTON: Remember when we used to get up every Tuesday morning and ride our bikes to  
 the Mall?  
 BROOKE: So you could buy some stupid CD’s.  
 PEYTON: Yeah, and you could buy make-up your mom wouldn’t let you wear. We’d spend  
 half the day in my bedroom just listening to music and putting on awful eye shadow,  
 and that was just the Tuesdays. We used to do a lot of really great stuff until guys  
 got in the way.  
 BROOKE: I was actually just going to the mall with you to check out Roy.  
 PEYTON: Brooke, we were nine.  
 BROOKE: What’s your point?  
 PEYTON: (Laughs and so does Brooke.) OK, I am sorry, I should’ve shown you the  
 letter but…considering our history, it scared me so…I just…I just wanted my friend  
 back for a little while.  
 BROOKE: (Shakes her head, giving in.) Come on. God! (They laugh, shoving and hugging  
 each other good naturedly.)

 KAREN: (Turns and looks at her.) Oh, I guess my heart just wasn’t in it today.  
 (Haley stands at the door, wondering if she’s going to get the same reception she  
 got from Deb.)  
 KAREN: (Waving her forward.) Come on in Mrs Scott.  
 HALEY: (Hugging Karen.) I’m sorry, I really wish you could have been there but it  
 was so sudden.  
 KAREN: Yeah.  
 HALEY: Is Deb here? I figured you must have talked to her.  
 KAREN: She had to go back to the hospital.  
 HALEY: She was really upset.  
 KAREN: Dan’s not doing so well.  
 HALEY: I know, but I meant with me.  
 KAREN: Does that surprise you?  
 HALEY: Yeah, little. I could understand if it was Dan but Deb’s always been really  
 supportive of my relationship with Nathan.  
 KAREN: Yeah, when you were dating.  
 HALEY: Is that how you feel?  
 KAREN: Haley, it doesn’t matter how I feel.  
 HALEY: It matters to me.  
 KAREN: Haley…I know that you and Nathan are in love and you know that I was also  
 in love in high school (pause) but sometimes, love fades…and, I just hope with  
 all my heart that…it doesn’t fade for you.

 NATHAN: Hey man.  
 LUCAS: (through the phone.) Crazy forty-eight hours huh?  
 NATHAN: Yeah, Yeah I guess so.  
 (Cut back to Charleston.)  
 LUCAS: So listen, um, (uncomfortable silence) I know this is weird for us but…I  
 just wanted to call because-  
 NATHAN: (though the phone.) Oh yeah. (Cut back to Tree Hill.) Yeah he’s ah, he’s  
 still unconscious but, you know him, he’s just waiting to wake up on his own terms.  
 LUCAS: (Through the phone) Well look, (Cut back to Charleston.) I’m here for you  
 OK? (pause) For you and Haley both. (pause) Just call if you need anything.  
 (Cut back to Tree Hill.)  
 NATHAN: Thanks Luke.

 happen anyway?  
 FLASHBACK TO:  
 [INT. HALEY’S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY]  
 (Lydia and Jimmy are sitting on different couches as they discuss Nathan’s proposal.)  
 LYDIA JAMES: The boy’s emancipated Jimmy. Haley just needs our permission.  
 JIMMY JAMES: Need I remind you that up until an hour ago, this boy came and went  
 through a second story window like a horny cat burglar. How can you even be  
 considering this?  
 LYDIA JAMES: Jimmy, you know our daughter. (Shot of Haley’s legs as she comes down  
 the stairs quietly.) (v.o) She has never done an impetuous, hasty thing in her life.  
 Most days, she’s more mature than we are. They’re in love.  
 JIMMY JAMES: They’re in high school. Besides, if it’s meant to be, it’ll still be  
 meant to be after college.  
 LYDIA JAMES: OK; we forbid her to do it. She hates us. She keeps seeing him, maybe  
 she gets pregnant, she drops out of school, she turns to a life of prostitu-  
 JIMMY JAMES: Oh stop it.  
 LYDIA JAMES: tion. Oh! There she is, smoking crack and sleeping in the gutter.  
 (Shot of Haley smiling.)  
 LYDIA JAMES: Did you know that my parents forbid me to marry you?  
 JIMMY JAMES: Why?  
 LYDIA JAMES: Because they thought that we were too young.  
 JIMMY JAMES: Well why didn’t you listen?  
 LYDIA JAMES: (holds him.) Because I loved you. And in the end we got married all the  
 same and we’ve made quite a life together. But I always loved them less for not  
 seeing what I saw in you.  
 END OF FLASHBACK:

 BROOKE: So I’ve been thinking I’m done with boyfriends for a while.  
 PEYTON: (not believing.) Right. Brooke Davis, solo?  
 BROOKE: Relationships are just too hard. Hooking up with boys is so much easier.  
 PEYTON: (Sighs) So I’ve been thinking, (Picks up the letter.) I don’t wanna read  
 the letter. I mean you can, I just (shrugs) whatever it says, I don’t wanna know.  
 BROOKE: Are you sure?  
 PEYTON: (Nods) I mean it’s not gonna change how I feel.  
 BROOKE: About Lucas.  
 PEYTON: Yeah, about him. Or you, or me. I don’t know, aren’t you tired of measuring  
 yourself by what guys think? I just…I need to stop chasing boys and focus on myself  
 more so. (Shrugs)  
 BROOKE: (Nods) I hear ya. (Throws the letter into the bonfire.) Hoes over Beaus?

 LUCAS: (o.s) Hey Keith? (Keith looks at him, startled.) I thought I might find you here.  
 KEITH: (look about him as if he doesn’t know where he is.) Yeah I was just, uh,  
 standing here, listening to that voice in my head.  
 LUCAS: And what’s it saying?  
 KEITH: It’s saying if we leave this place today, we may never come back.  
 LUCAS: (nodding) And what’s the voice in your heart say?  
 KEITH: Luke, you know that’s not fair. I mean, you know Dan’s a-he-he’s a bad guy.  
 You said it yourself; you hope that he would die.  
 LUCAS: I said that for you. I know how bad you want this.  
 KEITH: Yeah, yeah I do want this, don’t you?  
 LUCAS: Yeah, I do but it jus-  
 KEITH: But what?! Why should we have to give it up?! I mean he was never a father  
 to you, he-he leaves your mom when she’s pregnant, he rides Nathan until he cracks  
 under the strain. Whitey, Deb, every single life that he touches is worse because  
 of it. And now we’re just supposed to, you know, give it all up in his hour of need.  
 (sighs) I’m sorry Luke but just give me one single reason…why I should go back.  
 LUCAS: (smiles as he realises why he’s going back.) Because he’s your brother.

 So what?  
 HALEY: So, ‘Natalie Merchant’ after ‘NOZ’ and ‘Wilco’ before the ‘Wu-Tang Clan’?  
 NATHAN: (shrugs) So you listen to crummy music. I can live with that.  
 HALEY: (sadly) We made a mistake Nathan.  
 NATHAN: Haley-  
 HALEY: No. I’m-I’m not ready for this. I just, I just really wanna go home to my

 NATHAN: Haley. Haley, listen this is not a mistake.  
 HALEY: (crying) How can you be sure because there is nobody that thinks this thing  
 can work.  
 NATHAN: I do. (He picks up her wedding ring.) I promise you Haley. I will always
