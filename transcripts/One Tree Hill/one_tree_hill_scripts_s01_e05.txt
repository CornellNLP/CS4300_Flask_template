 [TRAFFIC LIGHT. It‘s green, but PEYTON waits]  
 [KAREN’S CAFÉ. LUCAS is reading PEYTON’S comic strip]  
 [PEYTON at the light. A car drives up behind her and beeps]  
 DRIVER: Hey, lets move it lady. Come on!  
 [The comic strip has a stop light, and the red one says ‘People always leave.’ HALEY walks in but when she sees LUCAS, she starts to leave. LUCAS chases her out]  
 LUCAS: Haley. How long are we going to do this?  
 HALEY: Do what?  
 LUCAS: Avoid each other.  
 HALEY: You tell me. You’re the one upset.  
 LUCAS: And you’re the one who lied to me.  
 HALEY: I don’t know what to say to you, Luke.  
 LUCAS: Just explain to me why you were with Nathan. Huh? I mean, considering the past few weeks and what he’s done…  
 HALEY: I can’t.  
 LUCAS: You know how I feel about him, Haley.  
 [LUCAS starts to leave]  
 HALEY: Lucas, fine! Yes. I know how you feel about him. But there is something you don’t know. [Pause] I promised him I’d tutor him if he left you alone.  
 LUCAS: What?  
 HALEY: I’m doing it for you, Luke.  
 [HALEY leaves and PEYTON drives by in her car. LUCAS starts to run after her as she speeds through a red light. LUCAS watches, shocked]  
 [THEME SONG]  
 [NATHAN and TIM are practicing basketball in his yard]  
 TIM: So you and Peyton are history?  
 NATHAN: Nah. I wouldn’t count on that.  
 TIM: No?  
 NATHAN: Yeah. This is what she does. She freaks out, we break up; a few days later, we make up.  
 TIM: So why put up with that?  
 [NATHAN smirks]  
 NATHAN: Because a few days later, we make up.  
 [DAN runs over]  
 DAN: Hey, ball.  
 [NATHAN throws DAN the ball and DAN shoots it in]  
 DAN: Expect plenty more of that at the father/son game because we’re going to crush you guys.  
 NATHAN: Oh yeah?  
 [NATHAN shoots the ball]  
 NATHAN: You can expect more of that.  
 DAN: Bring it on.  
 [KAREN’S CAFÉ. HALEY’S working and LUCAS is sitting at the counter. HALEY walks over to LUCAS]  
 LUCAS: I’m an idiot.  
 HALEY: I know.  
 LUCAS: I’m sorry. [Pause] I miss hanging out with you, Hales.  
 HALEY: Yeah. I miss hanging out with you too.  
 LUCAS: Listen. I appreciate everything you did for me. I do, Haley, but- how about you let me handle the team from now on, okay?  
 HALEY: Okay.  
 [HALEY starts to walk away]  
 LUCAS: All right. So you can… stop tutoring Nathan now.  
 [HALEY stops]  
 HALEY: Um, no. I, I can’t.  
 LUCAS: Haley.  
 Lucas. I can’t. I promised him. If I break that promise, I‘m, I’m just as bad as... you think he is.  
 [HALEY walks away and LUCAS sighs. A MAN walks over to LUCAS]  
 MAN: Hey, Lucas, I’m looking forward to see you play in the father/son game this year. Good article about you and your pop.  
 [MAN sets newspaper down and LUCAS picks it up. There’s an article with the headling “Great Scott: A Basketball Tradition Lives On ,” with a picture of DAN and NATHAN]  
 [DAN SCOTT’S HOME. NATHAN is reading the article aloud to DAN]  
 NATHAN: Who would’ve known that Dan Scott’s basketball pedigree would be inherited by his two sons, Nathan Scott and Lucas?  
 DAN: You’ve got to be kidding me.  
 [DAN takes the paper]  
 NATHAN: That’s great, Dad. We’re all one big happy family now.  
 DAN: Watch it. [Pause] I wonder what they’re paying this reporter to support his crack habit?  
 DEB: How about some breakfast?  
 DAN: I lost my appetite.  
 DEB: Dan, the boy exists. He’s on the team. It’s not exactly headline news.  
 DAN: No, Deb, apparently it is.  
 DEB: Well, how do you think Lucas and Karen feel about it?  
 DAN: Gosh, I don’t know. Maybe we should invite them over for breakfast and find out.  
 NATHAN: Alright, look. If you guys are going to argue, I’m out of here.  
 DEB: We’re not arguing and your breakfast is getting cold.  
 NATHAN: I’m just going to grab something at school with my brother.  
 DEB: You know, there is a chance that Lucas and Nathan can get along if their father encouraged it.  
 DAN: True. But there’s also a chance that hell can freeze over.  
 [They glare at each other]  
 [TREE HILL HIGH. NATHAN walks over to PEYTON’S locker]  
 NATHAN: You’re not still mad at me, are you?  
 PEYTON: I’m not mad. We’re just over.  
 [PEYTON walks away, leaving a shocked NATHAN behind. BROOKE walks by and over to LUCAS]  
 BROOKE: Hey cutie. I saw your picture in the paper. [Pause] Personally, I didn’t think it did you justice.  
 LUCAS: No?  
 BROOKE: No. [Grabbing the front of his shirt] Far too much clothing.  
 [BROOKE walks away and LUCAS sees HALEY and NATHAN talking in front of the Tutoring Center, and glares at them]  
 [GYM. The team’s practicing and WHITEY walks over to LUCAS]  
 WHITEY: Hey, Lucas. That father verses son game’s coming up. Considered who you want to play with.  
 LUCAS: I figured I’d skip it.  
 WHITEY: Oh, come on, son. I know it’s hard, but it will be worse if you don’t play. [Pause] Besides, I thought you said you were through hiding from Dan.  
 LUCAS: I am.  
 WHITEY: Well, wouldn’t it be fun to dunk on him?  
 [WHITEY pats LUCAS on the back and they share a smile. WHITEY walks away]  
 [GYM. The cheerleader’s are practicing and BROOKE’S leading them]  
 CHEERLEADERS: Here we go! Ravens, lets score!  
 BROOKE: Wait! Hold on, Peyton, you’ve got the arms wrong.  
 PEYTON: It’s not brain surgery, Brooke.  
 BROOKE: Okay, what’s with the attitude?  
 PEYTON: What’s with your life? Seriously, aren’t you embarrassed that the most important thing in your world is some stupid cheer?  
 BROOKE: Look, I’m really sorry things didn’t work out with you and Nathan, but don’t go all Mariah on me, okay?  
 PEYTON: You think this is about Nathan? [Pause] You’re not even close! You’re not even in the neighborhood of close!  
 BROOKE: Okay, then, what’s wrong?  
 PEYTON: What’s wrong is how… pointless all of this is.  
 BROOKE: Stop saying that!  
 [PEYTON’S outbursts have everyone in the gym, even WHITEY, staring at her]  
 PEYTON: No! Because it’s true. What difference does it make if you sleep with a popular guy, or you go to the right party, or you know the moves to some moronic cheer to do with some lame-@#%$ game I could care less about!  
 [PEYTON storms away and a stunned BROOKE looks at LUCAS and NATHAN]  
 [AUTO BODY SHOP. LUCAS walks in as KEITH works on a car]  
 KEITH: Hey. You’re not working today.  
 LUCAS: Yeah, I have a favor to ask. Uh, there’s this father/son charity basketball game. Whitey says I’ve got to play, so… you interested?  
 KEITH: Yeah.  
 LUCAS: Yeah?  
 KEITH: Yeah, okay. Of course, I might be, you know, a little out of shape, not to mention I… wasn’t worth a crap back in high school.  
 LUCAS: Well, it’s better for us, right? [Pause] Well. Why don’t you start coming to the court with us?  
 KEITH: Hang with a member of the Scott basketball dynasty?  
 [KEITH holds up the newspaper]  
 KEITH: So how are you doing with that?  
 LUCAS: Well. What are you going to do? Sucks for my mom…  
 KEITH: Yeah. What about you?  
 LUCAS: Honestly… I can’t stand being connected to Nathan or Dan.  
 [DAN rides in on his bike]  
 DAN: Hey, big brother! I was getting some cardio in, ran out of water. You wanna help me out?  
 KEITH: Yeah. Sure, why not?  
 [KEITH grabs a water bottle]  
 DAN: So, uh, you wanna buy some charity tickets to the big father/son game?  
 [KEITH throws the bottle to DAN]  
 KEITH: Oh, well, I, you know, could if I wasn’t playing in it. Luke invited me.  
 DAN: Oh, great. Well, try not to soil the Scott family name while you’re at it.  
 KEITH: Yeah… that’s every day advice for you, huh?  
 [DAN ignores him, turning to LUCAS]  
 DAN: Hey, kid. Seems as though you have an obligation to the family name too. Don’t blow it.  
 [LUCAS, who has kept quiet until now, turns angrily at DAN]  
 LUCAS: That article’s a lie. You’re not my father and you never were.  
 DAN: You’re right. It is a lie. You should never have had the name in the first place.  
 [DAN rides off]  
 KEITH: Hey! Dan!  
 [LUCAS punches the wall]  
 KEITH: You okay?  
 LUCAS: Look! I have no responsibility to him or his name.  
 KEITH: Just… Don’t let him get inside your head, okay?  
 LUCAS: You know what. I don’t plan on it. You know, as a matter of fact, I think it’s about time I get out from under this guy completely.  
 KEITH: What’s that supposed to mean?  
 LUCAS: Meaning I’m not gonna be a Scott anymore. I’m gonna change my last name.  
 [KEITH looks upset]  
 [TREE HILL HIGH. DAN knocks on the door of WHITEY’S office]  
 WHITEY: You’re late. I expected you this morning after that article in the paper.  
 DAN: I understand Lucas has asked Keith to play in the basketball game. Do you think that’s wise?  
 WHITEY: Why not?  
 DAN: Well, Keith isn’t exactly a father.  
 [WHITEY laughs]  
 WHITEY: You’re not the best father, either, Danny, and you’re playing.  
 DAN: What about Lucas? You have to know this will be embarrassing for him.  
 WHITEY: Embarrassing for him? What about embarrassing for you?  
 [DAN starts to leave]  
 WHITEY: Wait a minute. This isn’t about Lucas and Keith. This is all about you, Danny… and that feeling you get in the pit of your stomach when you see the son that you…never claimed. [Pause] You were a great player. Maybe the best I ever had. But you can score a hundred points in this game, and that feeling’s not going to go away. It’ll be there until you acknowledge that Lucas is your son and that you made a mistake.  
 [DAN looks at WHITEY]  
 [THE MINI-GOLF COURSE ON THE ROOF. KAREN and LUCAS are playing]  
 KAREN: You uncle Keith’s been working hard getting ready for the game. He mentioned that you’re thinking of, uh, changing your last name?  
 LUCAS: I just don’t want people to read these stupid articles and think I played ball just because Dan did. I don’t want you to have to read that stuff.  
 KAREN: Well, you’re in the spotlight now. The article’s come with the territory. But I don’t want you to run away from that. I’d rather you face your problems head on.  
 LUCAS: I just… figured it would make you happy if I took your name.  
 KAREN: When I found out I was pregnant, Dan already had a basketball scholarship and nothing was going to get in the way of that. But then something strange happened. Right before classes started, Dan changed his mind. He said he’d finish the semester and… we’d get married. So when I went into labor and you appeared, the nurse asked for your name and I said it was Scott. Keith was there, and when the nurse brought you in she let him hold you. I’ve known Keith my whole life, and that’s the only time I’ve seen him cry. [Pause] Your father never showed up.  
 LUCAS: So to hell with him. I don’t want his name.  
 KAREN: Keith’s a Scott too, you know.  
 [LUCAS looks pained]  
 KAREN: I’ve never been ashamed of you, Lucas, not for a second. Or your name. Then I also never had to carry that name in this town the way you have, so if you want to change it, you have my blessing. But it’s just a name, Luke. What you do with it is up to you.  
 [TREE HILL HIGH. NATHAN runs to catch up with BROOKE]  
 NATHAN: Brooke!  
 [BROOKE turns to him and waits for him to catch up]  
 NATHAN: Hey. Have you heard from Peyton?  
 BROOKE: Not since you two broke up and she went psycho on me in practice. Why?  
 NATHAN: Because she’s not in school. And she won’t pick up at home or on her cell.  
 BROOKE: Well… maybe she’s out kicking the homeless.  
 [CEMETARY. PEYTON’S sitting on a bench, lighting a cigarette. WHITEY walks over]  
 WHITEY: A lot of smokers in this place.  
 PEYTON: I don’t really smoke. I just figured since Nathan and I broke up, I’ve got room for a new bad habit.  
 [WHITEY laughs]  
 WHITEY: Mind if I sit down?  
 [PEYTON pats the bench]  
 WHITEY: She was quite a gal, your mother.  
 PEYTON: Yeah.  
 WHITEY: She used to lead cheers for my team, too. And you’ve got her looks.  
 PEYTON: I don’t really remember her.  
 WHITEY: Oh, I do. She was a wily one. Your old man didn’t stand a chance.  
 PEYTON: So what are you doing here? Making a reservation?  
 [WHITEY laughs]  
 WHITEY: You better watch it! [Pause] No. No. My wife, Camilla, is buried out here. Right over behind those trees. I couldn’t get in a word edgewise while she was alive so I come out here and visit, tell her about things.  
 PEYTON; You think she’s listening?  
 WHITEY: Yeah. I know she’s listening. [Pause] I lost my wife just about the time your mother passed away. That always make us weak and tough one.  
 PEYTON: They’re all tough.  
 WHITEY: Yeah.  
 [They look off sadly]  
 [NATHAN’S HOUSE. HALEY finishes correcting a paper of NATHAN’S]  
 HALEY: The good news is you did better… and the bad news is better is a D.  
 NATHAN: Yeah. I guess I didn’t really give this one my best shot.  
 HALEY: What’s going on with you?  
 NATHAN: Well. You know me and Peyton broke up.  
 HALEY: Peyton and I.  
 NATHAN: Oh. She broke up with you too? [Pause] Just… I didn’t know she was going to take it this hard. She went off on Brooke at practice. I’m kinda worried about her.  
 HALEY: Well, maybe you should’ve worried more about her when you were together. I’m sorry, but come on, it’s true.  
 NATHAN: No! You don’t know the first thing about Peyton and I.  
 HALEY: Me and Peyton.  
 NATHAN: Whatever.  
 
 
 
 [PEYTON’S in her car, waiting for the light to turn red. LUCAS runs over]  
 LUCAS: Why do you do this?  
 [LUCAS gets in]  
 PEYTON: If I were you, I’d get back out now.  
 LUCAS: Not until you tell me what’s going on.  
 [The light turns red and PEYTON drives through it]  
 LUCAS: Come on! Slow down, Peyton! Come on! Slow the car down! Peyton? Slow the car down.  
 PEYTON: She was driving to school to pick me up. She was late, so she ran a red light. It was one light at the wrong split second and it ended for her.  
 [PEYTON stops]  
 PEYTON: My mom ran one red light. I run them all the time and nothing happens. It’s not fair.  
 LUCAS: No it’s not.  
 PEYTON: You can get out now.  
 LUCAS: Or I can stay if you want.  
 PEYTON: No. You can’t.  
 [LUCAS gets out and watches as PEYTON drives away]  
 [THE GARAGE. KEITH’S working and DAN walks in]  
 DAN: Hey, Keith.  
 KEITH: Hey. Twice in a week. It’s got to be some kind of record.  
 DAN: Yeah, well, it’s this father/son thing.  
 KEITH: Yeah. How about a frostie?  
 DAN: Nope, I’m in training.  
 [KEITH laughs]  
 KEITH: It’s just a game, Dan.  
 DAN: No. It’s a public event. I mean, what are people gonna think? Especially after that article?  
 KEITH: Oh yeah. About that… what in the hell is wrong with you telling Lucas he never deserved the name Scott?  
 DAN: Well, he doesn’t.  
 KEITH: The hell he doesn’t. You fathered him, Dan.  
 DAN: That’s right. Which brings me to my original point. What do you think you’re doing playing in the basketball game? I mean, whatever you think you are to Karen and her son, you’re not a husband. Or a father.  
 KEITH: How much does a suit like that cost? [Pause] Because it’s gonna look like hell when I lay you out all over that greasy floor.  
 DAN: Come on, big brother.  
 KEITH: That’s right. Big brother. And no matter what you did on that basketball court a lifetime ago, and no matter what you do now, I’ll always be your big brother. So guess what, Danny boy? It was my name first. It’s Lucas’ name now. And there’s nothing you can do about it.  
 DAN: Okay, Keith.  
 KEITH: You know, you can be ashamed of me. And you can be ashamed of Lucas. But what makes me think we’re not just as ashamed of you? Huh? [Pause] Now get out of my shop.  
 [RAVENS’ LOCKER ROOM. PEYTON walks in and all the guys are wooping and catcalling, and NATHAN looks stunned]  
 PEYTON: [To NATHAN] Hi.  
 [PEYTON reaches WHITEY’S OFFICE]  
 PEYTON: Hi.  
 [WHITEY laughs]  
 WHITEY: Um, you never know who you’re going to see in the boys’ locker room these days.  
 PEYTON: Or what you’ll see. [Pause] I thought maybe we could talk. Unless… you’re too busy.  
 WHITEY: No, sure. We can talk.  
 [NATHAN’S house. NATHAN and HALEY are talking]  
 HALEY: Still in denial?  
 NATHAN: About what?  
 HALEY: Missing her. [Pause] It’s okay that you do.  
 NATHAN: What… are you my tutor or my shrink?  
 HALEY: Whatever you need.  
 NATHAN: I treated Peyton pretty bad. She had every right to walk away. Okay, yeah, it was my fault. I screwed up. I just wish I had another chance.  
 HALEY: Nice work.  
 NATHAN: That was the truth.  
 HALEY: No. On your practice exam. 81.  
 NATHAN: Oh. [Pause] You know, it’s funny. I think we’ve actually talked more than Peyton and I ever did.  
 HALEY: Peyton and I… good job.  
 NATHAN; Yeah, you too. [Pause] Hey… are you coming to the game?  
 HALEY: Um, well, it depends on how you do on your English exam. Anything less than an 81, I’m staying home and watching The Office.  
 [HALEY starts to leave]  
 NATHAN: Alright. [Pause] Haley?  
 [HALEY turns back to look at him]  
 HALEY: Yeah?  
 NATHAN: I know this hasn’t been easy for you. I just wanted to say thanks.  
 HALEY: Good luck.  
 [THE BRIDGE]  
 WHITEY: My wife wouldn’t let me smoke in the house, so, uh, I got in the habit of coming up here to this bridge. [Pause] I’d offer you one, but I know you’re trying to cut down.  
 PEYTON: How long have you been coaching?  
 WHITEY: Too long.  
 PEYTON: Do you ever wonder about it?  
 WHITEY: What?  
 PEYTON: I mean, you’ve spent your whole life watching boy’s play a game.  
 [WHITEY laughs]  
 WHITEY: Well, I’d prefer to think I was teaching them to play. [Pause] Yeah, sometimes I think about the conversations when I’m finished between me and my wife. The holidays I missed because I was off coaching somewhere. That’s when I come closest to thinking it was a mistake.  
 PEYTON: Do you miss her?  
 WHITEY: Every day. [Pause] Peyton, it’s hard to lose somebody. I spent a lot of time searching for reasons or answers. But you can’t find what’s not there. It just happened.  
 PEYTON: So you gonna light that thing or what?  
 WHITEY: No. I used to love cigars but I haven’t smoked one since I lost Camilla. I don’t even carry matches anymore. I don’t guess I’ve been much help to you. But I do know one thing. Your mother’s proud of you.  
 [WHITEY starts to leave]  
 WHITEY: Take care of yourself, kiddo.  
 [PEYTON looks away sadly]  
 [ROOFTOP MINI-GOLF COURSE. HALEY is playing and LUCAS comes up]  
 LUCAS: Hey.  
 HALEY: Hey. [Pause] I really don’t want to be like this, Luke.  
 LUCAS: What is that?  
 HALEY: This. Us skirting around each other. I mean, we’re friends. You know, when you wanted to join the team, I didn’t understand it and I told you that, but I supported you.  
 LUCAS: I know.  
 HALEY: So… support me! When I’m tutoring someone, and they get it, and that light goes on, I feel good! I feel worthy. The same way that you feel when you play basketball. Besides, having things gotten better for you? The team’s left you alone, the hazing’s stopped? Yeah. So, that’s worth the risk for me. What’s not worth the risk it us. We’re friends and that is important to me.  
 LUCAS: You’re just tutoring him?  
 HALEY: I am just tutoring him. That’s it.  
 LUCAS: Okay.  
 [They knock fists, smiling]  
 [PLAYGROUND COURT. LUCAS and KEITH are practicing]  
 LUCAS: Oh, game.  
 KEITH: I think I pulled a kidney.  
 [They laugh]  
 LUCAS: You alright?  
 KEITH: Yeah.  
 [They sit on a picnic table]  
 KEITH: Yeah… so you, uh, decide on the name thing yet?  
 LUCAS: Well, I downloaded the forms. But, uh… Mom’s still got to sign off on them.  
 KEITH: Mind if I tell you what I think?  
 LUCAS: I think you just did.  
 KEITH: Hey, I know I’m not your father, and, I’d never try to tell you what to do, but… I just… wish you’d think about it.  
 LUCAS: I will… and you know you don’t have to play if you don’t want to.  
 KEITH: Oh. Why do you say that?  
 LUCAS: I- I know it puts you in a weird spot. And Dan and Nathan are your family too, right?  
 KEITH: As far as I’m concerned, you and your mom are my family. As long as you’ll have me.  
 [They laugh]  
 KEITH: You know, Dan and I, we, uh, we’ve never seen eye to eye. Even when we were kids. And Nathan’s practically a stranger. Besides, uh, I was honored that you asked me to play.  
 LUCAS: Good. I was hoping you’d say that. [Pause] Listen. I’ve got to take off. Talk to you later?  
 KEITH: Si.  
 [KEITH and LUKE hug]  
 LUCAS: Take care, all right. [Pause] Hey, Keith?  
 KEITH: Yeah.  
 LUCAS: Thanks.  
 KEITH: Yeah.  
 [NATHAN’S HOUSE. DEB comes over to NATHAN outside]  
 DEB: How’s my boy?  
 NATHAN: Why? Dad send you to spy on me? Where’s my drink?  
 [DEB hands NATHAN the drink and he sniffs it]  
 NATHAN: You know, you’d think he organized this entire thing himself. Just so he could get back on the court.  
 DEB: I know he’s been tough on you lately, Nate. But I want you to know things are going to change around here.  
 NATHAN: I just wish he’d lay off, you know. I wanna do good for him. He just gets so worked up about this stuff.  
 DEB: Well, if you don’t want to play, don’t play. He’ll get over it.  
 NATHAN: You know that’s a lie, Mom.  
 [NATHAN hands DEB his drink and walks away. DEB looks upset]  
 [THE BRIDGE. LUCAS walks up to PEYTON, dribbling a basketball]  
 LUCAS: Hey. I’ve been thinking about you.  
 PEYTON: Try a cold shower. [Pause] Sorry. You set yourself up for that one.  
 LUCAS: Yeah, I guess so. How you doing?  
 PEYTON: Lets see. Um, I broke up with my boyfriend. My mom’s dead. And my dad’s away on a job.  
 LUCAS: What’s your dad do?  
 PEYTON: Captains a drudging boat. He’s only here for those forked anniversaries but this year, he sent his sympathies in an email. [Pause] I read your article. I think it seemed like you guys are just one great, big, happy family.  
 LUCAS: Yeah. It’s kind of ironic, huh? You know, I would gladly erase my dad if it would bring back your mom. [Pause] I wish I could change it for you.  
 PEYTON: Thank you. [Pause] I gotta go.  
 LUCAS: Hey, Peyton!  
 PEYTON: Don’t ruin it, okay?  
 [She walks off and LUCAS looks after her]  
 [DAN’S HOUSE. He’s sitting in a chair when DEB comes in]  
 DEB: Excited about your game tomorrow?  
 DAN: Truthfully? It’s like Christmas Eve.  
 DEB: And have you been naughty… or nice?  
 DAN: Have I been naughty? Well, which would you prefer?  
 [DAN pulls DEB into his lap and kisses her. She pulls back]  
 DEB: Honey. I know this is important to you and I, I know that Nathan is talented but… I think you push him too hard sometimes. Um, I worry that he won’t enjoy it anymore.  
 DAN: Oh, he enjoys it. If he doesn’t, he’ll regret it when it’s gone.  
 DEB: Do you?  
 DAN: Every day.  
 [DEB looks upset]  
 DAN: [Wistfully] There’s nothing like it, Deb. Walking into the arena, hearing the cheers of a sellout crowd, knowing it’s going to be your night. And for an hour or two, the world is yours and there’s nothing they can do to stop it. I wish I would’ve known you then. I wish you could’ve been there. No decisions to make, cars to sell, bills to pay. Just the game. And I was good. [Pause] It’s the best it ever was for me.  
 DEB: Better than your life now? Better than- than knowing your son? Or me?  
 DAN: It was different.  
 [DEB nods sadly]  
 [PEYTON’S ROOM. She’s painting and there’s a knock on the door. NATHAN’S there]  
 NATHAN: [Looking at painting, which is all black] What do you call that?  
 PEYTON: Love.  
 [NATHAN looks hurt]  
 PEYTON: What do you want, Nathan?  
 NATHAN: It’s what I don’t want. [Pause] I don’t want this for us.  
 PEYTON: Maybe you should’ve thought of that sooner.  
 NATHAN: Yeah, I know. And uh…I’ve been thinking about how we were when we started going out. Like that day at Rhysfield Beach. The nights here in your room.  
 PEYTON: We haven’t been that way in a long time.  
 NATHAN: We could be. Come on, Peyton. I’ve been thinking about you. I know you’ve been thinking about me.  
 PEYTON: I’ve actually had a lot going on lately.  
 NATHAN: Yeah, me too. My dad’s been going crazy about this father/son game and my mom… it’s like ever since she came back she’s been wanting to hang out.  
 PEYTON: [Interrupting] I really can’t hear this right now.  
 NATHAN: Alright. Well, how about you come to the game? Maybe we could hang out afterwards.  
 [PEYTON turns back to her canvas]  
 NATHAN: I miss you, Peyton. [Pause] I’ll see you there.  
 [NATHAN leaves and PEYTON continues painting]  
 [OUTSIDE WHITEY DURHAM FIELD HOUSE. NATHAN’S walking with a friend, but he sees HALEY]  
 NATHAN: Catch up to you later man. [To HALEY] Got a sec?  
 HALEY: Hey, yeah, what’s up?  
 NATHAN: Check that out.  
 [NATHAN holds up a test]  
 HALEY: An 84! That’s so great.  
 [NATHAN holds out his arms for a hug]  
 HALEY: Yeah, hey, congratulations!  
 [She hugs him, and LUCAS looks on. NATHAN meets LUCAS’ gaze, almost defiantly. NATHAN and HALEY pull away]  
 [LOCKER ROOM. The fathers are getting ready]  
 MAN: Hey! Dan the man, are you going to carry us tonight or what?  
 DAN: You know it, Bruce. I’ll carry the team and Keith can carry my jock.  
 [The men laugh and BRUCE shakes KEITH‘S hand]  
 BRUCE: Keith, it’s good to see you man.  
 KEITH: You too, Bruce.  
 BRUCE: I didn’t know you had a son that played ball too.  
 [DAN looks up]  
 KEITH: Well, actually I’m just a stand-in. One of the boys doesn’t have a father.  
 [KEITH and DAN share a look]  
 [ON THE COURT. They’re practicing, and LUCAS is ignoring HALEY, who’s screaming to him from the bleachers]  
 HALEY: Luke! Lucas! Hey, Scott!  
 [Both LUCAS and NATHAN look at her. HALEY gestures like, “what’s wrong with you?” A whistle blows and they run to the side]  
 ANNOUNCER: Good evening, ladies and gentlemen. And welcome to the Tree Hill Ravens’ father and son charity basketball game. Tonight the fathers battle the sons and the winner gets bragging rights. Coming soon tonight, Ravens son league MVP Nathan Scott. And for the father’s, the all-time even scorer in the history of Tree Hill, and state championship runnerup, put your hands together for Dan Scott!  
 DAN: Sounds like the old man got a louder applause than you did.  
 NATHAN: Are you sure your hearing aid’s not turned up too loud?  
 [They laugh and the game starts, DAN not taking any mercy on NATHAN]  
 [PEYTON’S driving again. She blows through a red light]  
 [THE GAME]  
 ANNOUNCER: Under a minute remaining now and the Ravens’ sons are putting on a show. They’ve made a mockery out of this one. 28 point lead and they’re running it in on the fathers… Lucas Scott spins the ball on his finger… over to Hamilton… Hamilton disgraces his father.  
 DAN: [To NATHAN] Don’t try that crap with me, Nate.  
 ANNOUNCER: Nathan Scott tries… scores and is left with an even 30 points at halftime.  
 [FATHER’S LOCKER ROOM]  
 DAN: You guys suck out there. It’s embarrassing.  
 KEITH: For you, maybe.  
 DAN: Come on… you play house with a girl I get pregnant in high school and I’m supposed to be embarrassed?  
 KEITH: It’s embarrassing because we’re old men, Dan, playing horribly and that’s the way it’s supposed to be.  
 DAN: Not for me.  
 [DAN walks into the adjoining RAVENS’ locker room]  
 TIM: Enemy approaching.  
 DAN: That’s right, enemy approaching. Are you going to bring your best game or what?  
 NATHAN: You’re down by thirty, Dad.  
 DAN: No, I’m talking to you. You bring your best game, I’ll bring mine, and then we’ll see.  
 NATHAN: We’ll see what?  
 DAN: We’ll see who’s the best. Or maybe you’d rather not know.  
 [KEITH walks in]  
 KEITH: Hey. Come on, relax, little brother.  
 DAN: This isn’t your place, Keith.  
 KEITH: Well, it’s not your place either, Dan. It’s their game now. We should be proud they’re so good.  
 DAN: Like you had anything to do with it.  
 KEITH: You walk away, Danny.  
 DAN: [To NATHAN] Lets see what you got.  
 [DAN walks away]  
 KEITH: [To TEAM] Any of you give me your best game and, uh, I’m gonna hurt you. [To NATHAN] Hey, you’re doing fine.  
 [PEYTON’S stopped at a green light. It turns red and she blows through, almost getting hit. She starts to cry in the middle of the intersection. Everyone’s beeping and yelling at her]  
 [THE GAME. Everyone runs out and HALEY chases LUCAS]  
 HALEY: Luke. Are you mad at me? What’s going on?  
 LUCAS: I don’t want to talk about it right now.  
 HALEY: Okay, can you just tell me what I did, please?  
 LUCAS: I saw you with him.  
 HALEY: Who Nathan? God, he got a good grade on that math quiz. It was nothing.  
 LUCAS: I want to believe you, Haley. I do. But I don’t think you’re telling the truth.  
 HALEY: I’m am telling the truth Lucas. There’s nothing going on.  
 [LUCAS notices her bracelet]  
 LUCAS: Nice bracelet.  
 [LUCAS runs off and HALEY looks upset]  
 ANNOUNCER: Well folks, an impressive showing for Dan Scott. The kids are just too much. What do you say we make this interesting? Lets make the score 0-0, and the next basket wins.  
 [RAVENS’ sons huddle]  
 NATHAN: Alright. Give me the ball.  
 TIM: Alright. Lets go, fellas. Ravens on three. One, two, three!  
 TEAM: Ravens.  
 [They take the court]  
 ANNOUNCER: The Ravens’ sons have the ball, and the next basket wins.  
 NATHAN: Game over, Dad.  
 ANNOUNCER: Nathan Scott to the tape. He catches the ball in the wing. He rides to the- holy crap!  
 [DAN pushes NATHAN to the ground. DEB jumps up, concerned]  
 ANNOUNCER: Lets hope the young man’s okay.  
 [LUCAS and WHITEY look on in shock. NATHAN’S still on the ground, and DAN looks down at him]  
 DAN: You okay? [Pause] I couldn’t give you the winning bucket, Nathan.  
 [The shot changes and a hand reaches down to help NATHAN up. It’s assumed to be DAN’S, but as NATHAN grabs on and gets up, the camera pans and we see LUCAS]  
 LUCAS: Beat them?  
 NATHAN: Yeah. But I want to do it myself?  
 ANNOUNCER: Well, good news, folks. Nathan seems to be okay. And the Ravens sons still have a crack at it… Lucas Scott hands the ball to Nathan. He drives- ooh! He drops the ball. It’s moving. That will create a turnover. The fathers have a crack at it. Looks like its payback time.  
 DAN: That was a sloppy turnover, Nathan. That’s not like you.  
 NATHAN: That’s because it was on purpose.  
 DAN: On purpose? Why?  
 NATHAN: Because you don’t deserve my best game, Dad. Look. I could’ve beat you. You know it and I know it. You know, if you want to mess with that, go ahead. I’ll give it to you.  
 [NATHAN steps back and DAN shoots. Everyone’s stunned]  
 NATHAN: You didn’t beat me, Dad. You never will.  
 [NATHAN storms off; everyone’s shocked]  
 [LOCKER ROOM]  
 LUCAS: Good game.  
 KEITH: What? Are you kidding me? I was by far the worst one out there. And that includes old Mr. Budieres and his wooden leg.  
 LUCAS: Oh, Keith, you know it’s never about basketball. And just so you know… what you did for Nathan, what you’ve done for me… well, lets just say I was proud to have you as my dad for the night. [Pause] You know, I’ve been thinking about what you said about the Scott name, and, and I think I’ll keep it. I just hope I can wear it as well as you.  
 KEITH: Thanks.  
 [They hug]  
 [OUTSIDE THE FIELD HOUSE. PEYTON’S there]  
 NATHAN: Hey. I’m glad you came. I knew you would. I want you to know thing’s are going to be different for us.  
 PEYTON: Did you know that my mom died tonight? Seven years ago?  
 [NATHAN clearly didn’t know]  
 PEYTON: You didn’t know because you never asked. I didn’t come here for you tonight.  
 NATHAN: Why’d you come?  
 [LUCAS walks out the door and PEYTON turns and looks at him. LUCAS looks at her. NATHAN looks shocked. He gets it]  
 [DAN in the locker room, upset]  
 [PEYTON walking away from both boys. They watch her]  
 [KEITH gets up and leaves the locker room, looking at DAN]  
 LUCAS: [V.O.] John Steinbeck once wrote “It seems to me  
 [PEYTON sits in her car. She waits for the green light and goes. Symbolically, as she drives, all the lights are green]  
 LUCAS: [V.O.] that if you or I must choose between two courses of thought or action, we should remember our dying and try so to live that our death brings no pleasure on the world."
