 Previously on "Chance"... 
 Blackstone : Gayland Parks was found bludgeoned to death at his residence. 
 Several calls were placed on Parks' phone to a Woody Hammond. 
 I told her she should turn herself in. 
 I'll do whatever you guys need me to do. 
 I just want to help you find Jackie. 
 Chance : I got into his computer. 
 Read some of his reports. 
 Jackie : Does Raymond know you did it? 
 Are you afraid I'll tell him? 
 He is your knight, after all. 
 No, he isn't. 
 But he wasn't always what he is now, either. 
 Jaclyn's been doing the Euro Massage books for years. 
 Should be enough to hang Raymond. 
 Help me get them and help me go. 
 Chance : What time does your bus leave? 
 Jaclyn : 20 minutes. 
 It's better if you don't know where. 
 You're probably right. 
 I'll be in touch. 
 Make your life whole again. 
 Please, don't hurt my child. 
 Man :  She's here. Till you give the boss what he wants. 
 What does he want? What?! 
 His wife. 
 She's gone! 
 Blackstone has my daughter. 
 He took her. I need D. 
 Come with me. 
 Sworn to secrecy about this place, and now I'm coming uninvited, with a guest, and without D. 
 Good evening, gentlemen. We're here for D. 
 Big dog. 
 [Wind gusting] 
 We saw the... the girl with the dog in the park. 
 We saw what happened to her. [Sniffs] 
 Is that what he has planned for Nicole? 
 You got no idea where Jaclyn's headed? 
 If I had to guess, I'd... I'd say Mexico, but, you know, I don't know. 
 She didn't tell me. 
 [Scoffs] 
 I... 
 I am done for real this time, D. 
 I'm just good and f*cking done. 
 [Exhales sharply] 
 What I took off that shitbird back at the massage parlor. 
 After you killed him. 
 You call Blackstone on that phone... it's a whole new day, my brother. 
 He thinks the fucker who stabbed him was some business rival, some Asian gangbanger. 
 Call comes in on that, he realizes that gangbanger is you... buckle up. 
 Speed kills. 
 Yeah, well, I still can't give him his wife back. 
 You have what she gave you. 
 You have his books. 
 It's your call, Doc. 
 Do this, or do nothing. 
 Nothing's something, too. It's how we live. 
 Life gives us choices, defines us by the ones we make. 
 And yet we make them all in complete uncertainty. 
 The Axiom of Choice. 
 Awesome. 
 [Cellphone beeps] 
 [Dialing] 
 [Line ringing] 
 [Ringing continues] 
 [Click] 
 Blackstone :  Yeah? 
 [Inhales sharply] 
 She's not coming back, Ray. 
 She's given you up. 
 Who the f*ck? 
 What the f*ck are you talking about? Right now, I am talking about the European Massage Parlor... girls flying in from Eastern Europe, $21,000 in airline tickets from the last six months, $127,000 in profits for the same period. You want me to go on? Just say what you want. I want my daughter... unharmed. You name the time and place. I'll bring you your books. You bring her back. Do we have a deal? Yeah, we do, you twisted prick. I'll call you back with a where and when. In the meantime, don't do anything stupid. Nicole... or wait, you call her "Nicky," right? Yeah, Nicky won't like that. [Line clicks] I think he went for it. He's gonna call back. 'Course he did. Well, what if he doesn't call back? He'll call. Well, until then, he has my daughter. What am I supposed to do? Get me a couple of training blades and a bottle of water. We're gonna get her back. [Indistinct conversations] If sh1t goes sideways, you don't want to be standing there with just your teeth in your mouth. This meeting's a one-shot deal, so we prepare for all contingencies. What are you talking about? It means I'll be around to deal with things. It doesn't mean you won't get wet. Med school you must have cut up some cadavers. That gives you a leg up on the average citizen. You know where things are. Okay, look, I'll tell you a little story. This radio op we had in the Kush, f*cking conscientious object... Oh, God, will you stop it?! Just stop it! Shut the f*ck up! I've seen your medical records, Darius! You were never in the goddamn Hindu Kush or Kandahar or the Teams. You were never in the f*cking military at all! What? You knew that, right? And it doesn't bother you? Stolen valor... Isn't that what you call it, pretending you've served? D's valor isn't stolen. There's more trauma in this life than war. You know that one, right? You ever call me "Darius" again, I'll punch you right in your face. Now take the blade. [Door opens] [Keys jingle lightly] [Door closes] [Sighs] [Grunts] Two sets of books, huh? That's pretty smart. For what? Insurance. Insurance for what, Jackie? [Sips] No one knows when they'll need insurance. That's the point of having it. I've been taking some off the top, too... every deposit. Yeah. Why? Can you tell me that? You know why. Tell me again. I'm f*cking stupid. Oh, 'cause you want to be free. Is it that again? Because you  were  free. He told me he put you on a bus. You were gone. Why the f*ck are you here? This f*cking doctor... you think he would have done the things I've done for you? [Man speaks Spanish] [Locks jostling, doors opening] ¿Quieres que me quede? No, está bien. [Radio chatter] Ms. Patterson, I'm Detective Blackstone. I'm from the Oakland police department. Did Sergeant Moreno tell you why I wanted to talk to you today? Yes. What'd he say? That someone got murdered. Did he tell you who? Someone I believed in. Someone who promised to help me. Gayland Parks? [Clears throat] Dr. Parks, yes. Yeah. Want to tell me what happened? Well, you know already, don't you? Otherwise you wouldn't be here. That's true. I don't know why, though. Maybe we can talk about that. Maybe the whole thing was an accident. I mean, when I first joined the police force I was shocked how often something just happened... one thing leading to another thing, and then you do something... [Taps table] ...you can't take back. Do you smoke? I quit... two months, one week, three days ago. Congratulations. Gayland said junk was keeping me in this life, that he'd helped people be free of it, that he could help me, too, if I just wanted it enough. I wanted it so much. I trusted him. How was he gonna help you? Well, we never got that far, because that was never where we were going. He took you to his place. He said he worked from home. He didn't. He told me... how it was going to be... ...that I was his now, that I wasn't leaving. That's what he said? Yes. [Breathes deeply] But even if he hadn't, sometimes you just... know a thing. Don't you? [Cell door clangs] She's something, right? She's not your average peddler, that's for sure. She tell you what you want to know? Gracias. She pretty much confirmed what I already knew, but yeah. So, what can we do for you next? Well, you know what happens next, Sergeant Moreno. I mean, you got to file with the Feds, and they have to get clearance from the Justice Department, Justice has to file with State to request extradition, and meanwhile, we're gonna forget why we even f*cking asked, right? [Scoffs] What are you trying to say? What I'm actually saying is, all it takes to simplify a given process is both parties being open to possibility. [Radio chatter] Man : Sir, we get a clearance call. [Radio clicks] So, do we know what happened to the Patterson woman? No. Feds couldn't find her. She's just gone. I'm sure the Feds weren't too motivated to help you look for her, either. Not as such, no. And it's a lot harder to find someone once they know the kind of trouble they're in. I really thought we had her. I really tried on this one, Loo. I'm sorry. [Keys thud] [Exhales sharply] [Glass thuds] That's it? It's done, just like that? Yep. You're free. You're my knight. Let's go for a drive. [Breathing heavily] Art's called Kali, started in the Philippines. Blade is good... very effective for close-quarter combat... easy to conceal, quick to deploy. Now switch your grip like this, reverse grip... great for concealment. Boom. High femoral. You're done. Strike comes in below the eye-line... blade's out of sight until the last second. Try it on me. Maintain eye contact, Doc. Remember, he doesn't see the blade until he's cut. Good. Now strike two... He's still wondering what just happened, probably gonna look down. Hand comes up, psycho position, and down, towards the back of the skull. There's an opening at the base of the brain. Foramen magnum. Land both strikes... first one bleeds him out, second one turns him off like a switch... over in a matter of seconds. Strikes are based on a template of three targets. You've just learned two. I want you to learn one more. [Cellphone rings] Yeah? Nicole :  Daddy? Where are you? Oh, God, Nicky! What happened? I-I'm at your apartment. A-Are... Are they with you? No, they're gone. Where are you? Please, come here. Come here now. Don't... I'm on my way. Just stay where you are. I'm gonna be there. Lock the door. Use the dead bolt. It's Nicky. She's in my apartment. I got to go. Come on, Doc. What are you gonna do, walk? We need to get Carl and his keys. "We"? I'm with you, Big Dog. Who knows, this could be a trap. We know they know where you live. Come on. You okay? Yeah. You? Yep. I mean, to drive? You said there were some issues a while back. Doing well enough for you and him to sack out the past hour. Listen, I'm sorry that I... I, you know, called you out back there in front of all the... It's okay. I could have said something... Usually do, anybody asks. Okay. But you knew what I thought. I mean, you could see I wasn't gonna ask. I could see you were the nervous type. I could see that letting you think I was ex-military seemed to help. You did more than let me think it, to be fair. Well, you could have told me you were half a whack job... to be fair... half a whack job with a record. But I told you before you told me, to be fair. Right, but that's only because Blackstone dug up your sh1t and scared the f*ck out of you... to be fair. 
 
 [Keys jostle] Nicky? Dad? Come on. Come on, I have to this, quick. Nick? Dad. Oh, baby. Oh, God. [Voice breaking] Dad, these two guys, who were they? I was so scared. [Grunts] Ow! Oh, God, are you okay? Did they hurt you? No, Dad, you're hurting me. Oh, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Oh, God, baby, what happened? Tell me what happened. They just... They drove me some place and locked me in this gross room. I-I couldn't understand them. They weren't speaking English. Well, how did they find you? They were here. [Door creaks] Dad, Dad! It's all right, it's all right. It's okay. This is D. He's a... He's a friend of mine. Take a look around. Just be a minute. So, they were in the apartment, t-the guys that took you? No, downstairs. I was waiting for the elevator, and they came in and started to go past me. But then they turned really fast and they grabbed me. I thought they were gonna kill me. [Sighs] Sweetie, you're okay. You're okay. Why did you leave Tahoe, honey? Why didn't you listen? 'Cause I couldn't take it... with mom all over me, and her stupid friend Liz talking about crystals the whole time. When her son's girlfriend offered me a ride back, I was, like... Wait, is this why we had to go there? Those men took me because of you? What did you do to them? I was helping someone who's caught up in something, and I didn't realize how bad it was. So stop! [Sighs] Can't you stop? D: All clear. Sweetie, I just got to talk to D for a second. Stay there. Be right back. Maybe that's it. Maybe we're done. Why do you say that? Well, we got her back. He gave her back. Jaclyn's gone. Maybe he realizes that he should be gone, too. I'll wait in the lobby. [Door closes] That guy doesn't look like any of your friends. Your friends have, like, tennis elbow. Yeah, well, he's a new friend. He's scary. Is he scarier than the guys who are after you? Sometimes. Your patient, the one who gave me this scarf, is she who you were trying to help? Why? Because she was there. I saw her. What? She was where? In the hall when they came back in to get me. A-And she was with a man. He had her by the arm like it hurt. And... she saw me, too, but then they were gone and I... I... Wait, this is Jaclyn? You're sure? Is she gonna be okay? Thanks, Neil. You got it. All right, I'll see you soon. Okay. I love you. I love you. [Siren wails in distance] I'm not gonna pretend I know what's going on here, but, um... anything I can do, okay? Oh, hey... No, Eldon. I got money. I'm good. I'm not being condescending. You need to go straight to Tahoe. Don't stop. You need food or gas, use cash, no credit cards. You need to make a call, use a pay phone. Okay. Got it. Thanks, Neil. Yeah. [Engine starts] [Phone rings, clicks] Yeah? Is Jaclyn with you? [Inhales sharply] She traded herself for your daughter. Now, that's love. So here's how it's gonna be... We are gonna meet and talk and get straight. And bring that second set of books with you. You know the Ocean Park Motel? On Ocean Beach. Yeah. Be there at 5:00... alone. I'll know if you're not. [Line clicks] Ocean Park Motel. We're gonna talk and get straight. Well, you know what that is. That's two things. First, it's letting you think you have hope of getting out of this still. But what it really is, is you dead at the scene. I had to guess, I'd say by suicide. The divorce, you're in debt, your reputation's gone... You just couldn't take it anymore. Cops find you like that, they won't look any harder. Well, then, I won't show. I... I-I'll... I'll get the books delivered to him. That's not gonna do it. Why not? You're a loose end. Look, here's the deal, Doc... You either face this, or you pray to God that he lets you go back to being who you were. You think he'll do that? No. I don't. Good, because he won't, ever. [Exhales slowly] What is the third strike I had to learn? I call this one the money shot. [Indistinct conversations] [Engine stops] I'm sorry. You should be after what you've made me do. I got here as soon as I could. It's fine. I'm off shift in 10 anyway. Okay. She's in the back of the car. [Ship horn blows] The mother wanted her arrested arrested for assault. Did she hurt the girl? No, but it turned into some type f*cking tug-of-war thing, I guess... She wouldn't let go. The girl started crying, and your wife said, "Come with me, I found you, you're safe now," pulling on her. Yeah, I got it. And the mother's like, trying... I got it, I got it, I got it, okay? Here. Go get lunch or something on me. Appreciate it. Thank you. Figured it can't be a bad thing to have you owe me one, right? Thank you. I'm here, sweetie. Jackie, I'm here. Ray. Hey. Ray, I saw her! Oh, no, you didn't. No, the lady called her "Violet," but she looked at me. I recognized her. I knew... It wasn't her, sweetheart. I knew... I knew it was. Sweetie... She was so beautiful. Okay, stop! This cannot keep f*cking happening! Okay? One of these times no one's gonna be here to call me, and you know what happens then? [Sniffles] We're gonna get you some help, okay? We can get you some... I saw her. Come on. We're gonna get you some help. Dr. Cohen... I can't do that. You  can  do that. You  won't. If she wants you to know what we talk about, she's free to discuss any and all of it with you herself. I heard you the first time. [Sighs] But other than that, I really don't know what else I can say. You said your wife needed help, and I'm trying to help her. But I'm sure you understand. I can't allow you to dictate how I do that. [Exhales sharply] If she were suicidal you would have to tell me what you heard. I think you know that's not true. My only immediate legal mandate to report is regarding child or elder abuse. But anything else I hear in confidence just comes down to whether I'm worried about being sued or not. Not just suicidal thoughts, but domestic violence, criminal activity... Deciding to tell anyone about those things is completely up to me. [Grunts] D. Now, this is interesting. All of this here... between the Cliff House and the Camera Obscura... lots of lines and shadows. Good stuff. This isn't so bad either. Crunchy. We have to assume he's got eyes... very important that you arrive there by yourself. Carl and I will get there ahead of you, do on-sight reconnaissance, find a spot, and once we have it, we'll let you know. [Sighs] I just want to be smart. You will be. You're gonna get him out of that motel room, and you're gonna let me do my thing. Trust me, brother. As of this moment, you are not the one in over your head. He is. [Gulls crying] [Indistinct conversations] [Car alarm chirps] [Cellphone rings] Yeah? Carl :  Where are you? Just parked up below the Cliff House, just next to a construction site. There's a path to the left. Got it. And just behind the Cliff House, there's a smaller building. It's shaped like a gi... Giant camera... Yeah, I see it. Now, over the ledge there's a 60-foot drop to the rocks and water, give or take. Here's D. D:  Big Dog. Have you seen her? Negative, but I've got eyes on the place... Crown Vic's around back, black Mercedes right next to it. I did clock a guy coming out of one of the rooms. Could have been a clone for that fucker I sent away. Look, Blackstone will try to make it look like he's alone, but he won't be. He'll have a play. Soon as I see it, I can deal with it. You copy? Doc, you copy? Yeah. I copy. Eyes in the back of your head. Wind shifts, don't wait to receive. You good for the call? Yeah. Roll the dice, brother. Okay. [Sighs] [Dialing] [Breathing heavily] [Cellphone vibrates] Talk to me. There's no point in killing anyone, 'cause that's just more sh1t you'll do time for, and believe me, if we don't settle this today, you will do time. It's your boyfriend. Where the f*ck you at, big talker? Just below the Cliff House, on the sidewalk. Why? 'Cause I'm not walking into that motel. You should be smart enough to know that. You meet me here. Then why should I trust you? You don't have to. It's a public place. It's out in the open. We can meet behind the building, if you like that better... say what we have to say, trade what we have to trade. I've got what you asked for. Now listen. She deserves her own life... without you, without me. I need to see her leave, alone. That doesn't happen, I call the cops and we can both burn. I got my daughter. She's safe. That's all I care about. That's what I'm willing to do. Yeah, what I want to know is how someone like you managed to stay alive this long. [Cellphone beeps] You happy? D: I made this for you. Sheath goes in the pocket of your pants, hooks catch on the fabric, hold the sheath in place when you draw. Fixed blade, so you don't have to open anything... fast way to deploy. Dagger... double-edged, cuts with both sides, great for stabbing. [Sheaths blade] [Glove compartment closes] Where's Radu, in the car? It's dark out. Let's go. [Clears throat] Jaclyn : Raymond. It doesn't have to be this way. If I don't come back, shoot her in the head. [Door closes] [Cellphone rings] Yeah? We're on. I'm at the motel. Your guy just pulled out in the Crown Vic, two more guys getting in the Mercedes. Any sight of her? Just the guys. There's gonna be some kind of play, but I'm on it. Just get to your spot and stay there. Copy. Good man. I'm staying on the Mercedes, but I'll tell you this... You get Blackstone alone on that path, you see a move, don't wait. Go first... trust your training then circle out and head for Land's End. Look for Carl. When you say... Hoo-rah, Big Dog! [Cellphone clicks] [Breathing heavily] [Car door closes] [Hyperventilating] [Line ringing] D:  What the f*ck, buddy? [Hushed voice] The man has got a gun and a badge. All I've got is a f*cking three-inch knife. Doc. We have to abort this, D. This is... This is insane. This is worse than insane. What am I gonna do, stab a cop? Focus. You need to focus. I'm a f*cking doctor, for Christ's sake. Tell Carl that I'm leaving. I... I can... If I can stay below the sidewalk, he might not see me. Ah, we have to rethink this. This is not gonna happen, not like this. I'm walking to Land's End. [Both laugh] [Indistinct conversation] [Panting] [Cellphone rings] [Cellphone beeps] Blackstone :  Where the f*ck are you, man? Come on, Doc. You win, I'm here, I'm alone, I got the key to her room. You bring me what you brought, you're welcome to her, and then we're done, okay? Do you have what I asked for? You can tell me that at least. I have it. We're in a public place, just like you said. I'm here, Doc. I'm ready to talk. I'm not gonna wait all night, though, you know? You know, my energy level isn't what it used to be? My f*cking lung. But you know how that works, right? You're a doctor. All right, what's it gonna be? You coming or not? I'm on my way. Well, hey, hey. There's a path behind you on your left. Leads down below the Cliff House. Okay. Well, we meet down there, away from the street. Why don't we talk about that when you get down here, okay? It's all good, Doc. Keep coming. Third move in the template. A single, fatal blow to the aortic arch... two inches off the center line, approximately at the second button. Aim for the spine. Maintain eye contact, Doc. Downside of this strike... It has to be made with sufficient force to break through the chest cavity and sufficient accuracy to find its target. Slashing at a femoral, even if not wholly accurate, will result in a debilitating wound. The money shot, if not carried out with absolute precision and wholehearted commitment, will likely prove a disaster. [Suspenseful music]
