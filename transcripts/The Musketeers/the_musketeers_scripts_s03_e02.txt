 [Sighing] 
 Constance. 
 I thought we were spending the morning. 
 What? 
 Together? 
 You do know this is not what I had in mind. 
 I know what you had in mind. 
 The garrison needs to eat. 
 Why exactly do we need a cadet guard to bring in provisions? 
 You've been away from Paris for a long time. 
 ♪ 
 [Groaning] 
 [Grunting] 
 Do you need to hit so hard? 
 How hard do you think they're hitting out there? 
 ♪ 
 Stand aside! 
 It's the Duke of Beaufort. 
 His lands feed most of Paris. 
 Beaufort : Let me through! 
 The harvest you sweated and suffered for all summer, it's gone. 
 [Groaning] 
 What does the granary keeper say? 
 The granary keeper is dead. 
 Who would do such a thing? 
 The refugees! 
 [Crowd grumbling] 
 ♪ 
 Cadets to attention! 
 Stand guard. 
 Clairmont, get Athos and the others now! 
 Now, Clairmont! 
 Move the children and old people away from here, and arm yourselves! 
 Against such odds? 
 I thought I'd taught you better than that, Sylvie. 
 If the cause is just. 
 Hold them here for as long as you can. 
 You men, up here, come! 
 Clementine! 
 Hubert : Quickly! 
 Hide the children, go! 
 Arm yourself, Pierre! 
 Go! 
 Defend yourselves! 
 Léon, what are you doing? 
 You saw that mob! 
 I'm not staying here to get slaughtered. 
 You'd desert us now? 
 Help Clementine. 
 Help her. 
 Come this way. 
 [Crowd shouting] 
 Cadets, fall back! 
 Fall back! 
 Form a line. 
 Our grain is there! 
 Two war heroes at once. 
 I deserve a medal. 
 [Grunting] 
 Clairmont : Captain! 
 Captain! 
 What do you want? 
 Captain, it's D'Artagnan. 
 There's a riot in Saint Antoine. 
 ♪ 
 Ah, to success, my lord. 
 Why did he murder my grain keeper? 
 We have made your grain disappear. 
 It is too late for us to put it back now. 
 Will you have a drink? 
 I won't drink with that creature. 
 [Chuckling] 
 If the King will pay the price we demand... 
 Price you demand, in fact. 
 We should settle with him now and end this squalid enterprise. 
 We wait. 
 The price is bound to go up. 
 The people of Paris have no bread. 
 Desperation is always lucrative. 
 [Chuckling] 
 Hold out for one week. 
 The King will double your money, and you'll settle your debts for good. 
 Drink. 
 I only drink with gentlemen. 
 He is trying to help you, My Lord. 
 Remember those niggling financial worries? 
 One week and they vanish. Forever. 
 Trust, Grimaud, hm? 
 He may not be a gentleman, but he has a talent for making money. 
 One week, no more. 
 Let's hope the King proves to be as amenable as you, My Lord. 
 [Gunshot] 
 Disperse immediately! 
 Stand back! 
 These are the names of the ring leaders. 
 You know their faces. 
 Arrest them. 
 You can't do that. 
 You again? 
 You're becoming a nuisance. 
 Don't touch her. 
 So this is the husband. 
 [Laughing] 
 You have married a world of trouble there, Musketeer. 
 You should keep her on a leash. 
 A leash? 
 Mm. 
 Arrest him for affray. 
 Just leave... 
 D'Artagnan! 
 Leave her! 
 Leave her! 
 I'll go quietly. 
 Proper wildcat, aren't you? 
 Let's not waste any time. 
 Break down the gates! 
 [Grunting] 
 ♪ 
 [Groaning] 
 Hubert! 
 Leave him alone! 
 Get up, Hubert! 
 I'll hold you up. 
 You go on. 
 If they see those, you'll condemn us all. 
 Burn them! 
 [Groaning] 
 Tell Treville what happened here. 
 [Neighing] 
 Marcheaux! 
 Marcheaux! 
 You don't have the authority to make these arrests. 
 On the contrary Madame. 
 They have my authority. 
 What's going on here? 
 Where's D'Artagnan? 
 Ah, the rescue party. 
 You're late. 
 The riot is over. 
 The troublemakers have been apprehended. 
 They've arrested D'Artagnan with the others. 
 Get involved with filth like this, and you will all face the consequences. 
 What are they meant to have done? 
 Is stealing the Duke of Beaufort's grain not enough for you? 
 Thanks to them, the people of Paris will go hungry. 
 How can you hide a thousand sacks of grain in here? 
 Well, why don't we take a look? 
 I'm sure we'll get a confession before they are hanged in the morning. We always do. 
 This is Paris. 
 They're entitled to a fair trial. 
 Being in Paris, does not make one a Parisian. 
 Or would you grant that status to the sewer rats? 
 Some rats have high enough status. 
 I'm ruined. 
 Our family has faithfully served Your Majesty and his forefathers for generations only for it end like this. 
 Calm down, Beaufort. 
 I'm sure we can do something to help. 
 The entire harvest is gone. 
 There are food shortages in Paris already. 
 How could this have happened? 
 Where were the Red Guard? 
 Breaking up the ensuing riot. 
 It seems, Majesty, the rabble that set up camp in Saint Antoine is responsible. 
 French citizens displaced by the war. 
 They came to Paris for sanctuary. 
 The obvious solution is to import a new consignment, Your Majesty, but that's likely to prove expensive. 
 Why does everything come down to more money? 
 Isn't the war costing enough? 
 We wouldn't want to risk any further unrest amongst the people. 
 What do you say, Treville? 
 The people expect their quarterly supply. 
 It has always been a gesture of the king's good grace... 
 But, of course, the king can not let his people suffer. 
 Treville is quite right. 
 I, myself, know someone, a financier who has contacts in the low countries and in England, Your Majesty. 
 He may be able to help us. 
 Very well. 
 I will meet the costs, this once. 
 [Gun cocking] 
 Are you without secrets, Captain? 
 This is more than secrets. 
 Calling for the king's head is open sedition. 
 That has nothing to do with Beaufort's accusations against us. 
 Are you going to arrest me? 
 Who taught you how to handle that? 
 I taught myself. 
 Then you are not a bad student, merely a poor tutor. 
 At this range, the bullet will pass clean through me. 
 There is every chance I will have strength enough to retaliate. 
 Those were my father's words, his life's work. 
 I couldn't destroy it. 
 This is treason. 
 15 years ago, this was the symbol for the Army of Suffering. 
 Rebels. 
 Ordinary men and women with many of the grievances you hear today: no food, shelter. 
 Their only crime was to petition King Henry for fairness. 
 Their cause was just. 
 Henry ignored their pleas. 
 Their anger grew with their suffering, and this symbol of protest appeared everywhere. 
 Then he answered, emphatically. 
 Destroy this and any others. 
 Feron will try to influence Magistrate Bellavoix. 
 Look to use anything against his prisoners. 
 D'Artagnan is still one of them. 
 He will be released in the morning. 
 The refugees may or may not be guilty, Athos, but I won't have them slaughtered on Beaufort's whim. 
 People must see there is still some justice left in this world. 
 Tell me, Musketeer, why did you defend us? 
 We mean nothing to you. 
 What the Red Guard were doing was unjust. 
 I couldn't just stand by and watch that happen. 
 You couldn't stand by? 
 Please, sit with me. 
 Come. 
 No, no, no, no. 
 Come, come. 
 [Coughing] 
 You can not blame them for mistrusting your uniform. 
 Everyone here had a home, trade, family. 
 All that was taken away by your kind. 
 My kind? 
 Yes My kind fights the war to maintain your freedom. 
 [Laughs] 
 And you think a Spanish king will be worse than this French one? 
 That's treason. 
 Perhaps. 
 I'm an old man. 
 You preach rebellion? 
 Is it rebellion to fight against unfairness whenever you see it, or to stand up against an unjust enemy? 
 Perhaps we are not so very different after all. 
 [Coughing] 
 Sit back, sit back, sit back, sit back. 
 Sit back. 
 [Groaning] 
 There is a better world coming, while we might not live to see it. 
 You will have a fair trial, Hubert. 
 I will see to that. 
 Minister Treville will help. 
 Hang them! 
 The sooner, the better. 
 We must cleanse the streets of these vermin. 
 What more do you want, eh? 
 Already there has been rioting, Magistrate Bellavoix. 
 For the sake of maintaining order in Paris, an example must be made. 
 This is a mockery of justice. 
 Where is your proof? 
 Minister Treville's point will stand, Governor Feron. 
 The evidence against these people seems unsatisfactory at best. 
 But what about the unsatisfactory damage to my family's good name? 
 I'm quite sure that the House of Beaufort has strength enough to recover. 
 [Feron groaning] 
 Governor Feron? 
 I can provide substantial evidence at Your Honour's convenience. 
 You have proof that one thousand sacks of grain have been secreted around the settlement? 
 It's not possible. 
 These refugees are resourceful, Treville. 
 Pending the production of the Governor's evidence, executions will be set at noon tomorrow. 
 [Huffing] 
 You can find evidence, I presume? 
 [Moaning] 
 Gaoler. 
 The old man needs a physician, now. 
 There's no point patching him up. 
 He'll be executed with the rest of them in the morning. 
 Hey! 
 Captain. 
 What's this? 
 We have to make it look real. 
 Governor Feron has a special task for you. 
 Be convincing. 
 [Grunting] 
 Interrogation. 
 Orders of the Governor. 
 If you're lucky, perhaps you'll be next. 
 [Coughing and gagging] 
 [Screaming] 
 Léon. 
 Don't break him. 
 He'll condemn us all. 
 Try to stay calm. 
 Look at me. 
 Try to stay calm. 
 We'll fight this. 
 We'll fight this. 
 [Léon groaning] 
 How? 
 You have more of these? 
 This could condemn all of the prisoners, D'Artagnan too. 
 Some would consider the ideas dangerous. 
 My father would say they're only dangerous because they still matter. 
 Oh, they're his ideas? 
 Well, he incited people? 
 Inspired them. 
 To revolt. 
 To fight for change for a better life! 
 Take a look around you. 
 Would you really leave Paris as it is? 
 
 
 
 Clairmont : Madame D'Artagnan! Madame D'Artagnan! 
 We used to knock. 
 Sorry, Captain. 
 Clairmont? 
 Found something. 
 One cup per person, three livres, take it or leave it. 
 We checked all the local markets, found nothing. 
 On the way back, we came across him. 
 Good work. 
 You wretched bunch of rodents, money first! 
 We should have a little talk with the trader. 
 He could benefit from our special brand of our tact and diplomacy. 
 It's been a while. 
 Move! 
 [Grunting] 
 Oh, I'm ever so sorry about this. 
 It's just that my friend here is certain that this is one of the sacks stolen from the Duke de Beaufort's store, you see. 
 It has the king's mark. 
 Oh, yes, so it does. 
 You're looking at a charge of treason. 
 I never saw the man before. 
 He was selling off the wagon behind the market square. 
 He's lying! 
 [Growling] 
 Oh, my! 
 Aramis, no. 
 No more breaking legs. 
 I never knew it was crooked! 
 Maybe just an arm, huh? 
 Last chance. 
 The wagon, it was branded with the sign of a star. 
 That's all I know. I swear. 
 This is who he got the grain from. 
 Most of my wagons are being used by the army. 
 You'll not find a spare in Paris. 
 There's a war on. 
 Why do I get the feeling our friend knows more than he's saying? 
 Mm. 
 What's that? 
 Limestone dust. 
 We've got a shipment of grain coming in from the south. 
 It's a big shipment. 
 You must've heard the store in Saint Antoine was robbed. 
 I can't help you. 
 All my wagons are out. 
 Even that one's promised. 
 Oh. 
 A fine-looking animal. Andalusian? 
 [Horses trotting] 
 Man : Ha! 
 There's only one limestone quarry this side of Paris. 
 I'm on it. 
 [Groaning] 
 [Door clanging open] 
 They've taken Léon away. 
 Then they have what they want... 
 [Door shutting] 
 A confession. 
 We must hang. 
 Listen to me. 
 I have friends on the outside that can help you. 
 [Groaning] 
 Hubert? 
 [Sighing] 
 Hubert? 
 Hubert? 
 Do it quickly. 
 Make sure the grain sacks can be found. 
 If you have to, take care of the watch. 
 Who's there? 
 Who's there? 
 Léon! 
 Thank heaven you're safe. 
 You're hurt. 
 What are you doing? 
 [Groaning] 
 Oh, the conceit of the man. 
 [Chuckling] 
 Beaufort must lie awake at night worrying about his own snivelling greed. 
 Got his nose so high in the air he should take care no one cuts it off. 
 You be careful, Grimaud. 
 I've been sneered at by better men. 
 They're dead now. 
 My dear fellow, I have always admired your practical nature, but you must remember His Lordship is a favourite of the king's. 
 However much Beaufort despises me, he'll keep coming back. 
 He needs what only I can give him. 
 You take too much. 
 You don't know the pain I'm in. 
 I know pain. 
 Then join me. 
 Hm? 
 Control at all times, eh? 
 Better to suffer than to lose judgment. 
 Have you never wondered what it might be like to let that invulnerable guard of yours down for just one moment, feel that sensation of pure euphoria crash like a wonderful wave, all that suffering just... washed away? 
 Hm? 
 Suffering is what makes us stronger. 
 There's always been something of the Old Testament about you, Grimaud. 
 [Chuckling] 
 Your work is not yet done. 
 It is in hand. 
 And if it is to be completed to the satisfaction of all concerned, I suggest you let me take my medicine. 
 [Gasping] 
 D'Artagnan. 
 Your letter to the Front said nothing of this. 
 Red Guards killing who they please, cowards like Marcheaux deciding a man's fate. 
 This is not what I fought for. 
 And what did you fight for? 
 We're freeing those people in there. 
 Of course, we are. 
 You think we've been out here doing nothing? 
 Huh? 
 So this is what Paris has become? 
 Innocent people condemned with no evidence and no one to speak for them. 
 That's the way Governor Feron likes it. 
 And nobody argues with the king's blood. 
 I wear the uniform of the king's own regiment. 
 Since when have the Red Guard had the authority to arrest and imprison a Musketeer? 
 His Majesty appointed Feron as Commander of the Red Guard. 
 He's not only family but a favourite too. 
 And this Marcheaux, he's bothered you before? 
 Marcheaux doesn't scare me. 
 That's not what I asked. 
 Look, D'Artagnan, Treville brought you back to fight a different kind of war. 
 The danger facing Paris is the very man who should be its protector. It's Feron. 
 Why stay here? 
 We will not be driven out by the Red Guards or Musketeers. 
 You trust anybody? 
 Every betrayal we ever suffered started with trust. 
 You should get out while you still can. 
 Since you're so keen to remove anything incriminating, perhaps you should tear the whole place down for us? 
 Well, let's start with the stolen medical supplies. 
 Athos! 
 These were not here yesterday. 
 Someone wants you to hang. 
 Everyone wants us to hang. 
 Not everybody. 
 [Woman screaming] 
 [Indistinct shouting] 
 What's happened? 
 [Wailing] 
 Oh, Clementine. 
 Short blade under the ribs. 
 This is the work of a soldier. 
 [Crowd screaming] 
 Search the place! 
 They mustn't find these. 
 How did they find their way through here? 
 [Grunting] 
 Hyah! Hyah! 
 Ahh! 
 [Screaming] 
 We now have proof Feron has no proof when he goes before the Magistrate. 
 There is Léon. 
 The Red Guard may have beaten him into a false confession. 
 Well, then we must find him before they hang the refugees on it. 
 Where's Porthos? 
 Following a hunch. 
 Following a hunch? 
 It's a good one. 
 No doubt. 
 Leave word for him. 
 Tell me, Hubert? 
 He died during the night. 
 Were you close? 
 He's my father. 
 I'm sorry. 
 The people of Saint Antoine demand swift justice, Monsieur Magistrate. 
 I fear for the stability of the district if it is not forthcoming. 
 I will not proceed without proof of the prisoners' guilt. 
 Proof may yet present itself. 
 The Musketeers found these inside the Settlement. 
 Then the prisoners are guilty. 
 No, the sacks were put there after their arrest, Your Honour. 
 Then, Your Honour, obviously other refugees are involved. 
 They are bound together by common grievances. 
 I doubt they would murder one of their own. 
 Murder, Treville? 
 A woman of the settlement named Clementine. 
 The Musketeers found her body close to the hidden evidence. 
 Then perhaps the prisoners are innocent, and the real thieves are still at large? 
 Without doubt. 
 Further evidence against the prisoners may still come to light. 
 Until it does, there will be no executions. 
 Everybody will abide by the rule of law, prisoners, ministers and governors. 
 ♪ 
 I believe that belongs to the king. 
 [Sword swishing] 
 I've never killed a Musketeer. 
 You never will. 
 [Grunting] 
 ♪ 
 We need to get out of here. 
 More will come. 
 Let them come. 
 They're Musketeers. 
 I want the man who brought them here. 
 ♪ 
 [Groaning] 
 [Chains rattling] 
 You think you can sell my grain on the streets of Paris, and I won't know? 
 Wasn't I paying enough for the use of your wagons, Nortier? 
 You have to steal from me too? 
 [Gasping] 
 Your greed led the Musketeers straight to my store. 
 I'll pay you. 
 Everything you lost... 
 More! 
 I grew up following the troops across every stinking, cess-pit battlefield there was, fighting for scraps just to survive. 
 I learnt never to let anything go. 
 No matter how hard they bite, scratch or tear, you hold on to what is yours. 
 [Screaming] 
 Take his horse to my stables. 
 You arrested the refugees on false charges. 
 A good man died. 
 Won't your little wife be wondering where you've got to? 
 You fabricated evidence, killed an innocent woman to cover your tracks, took the prisoner Léon when all else failed. 
 No doubt someone somewhere is beating a confession out of him. 
 Where is he? 
 You! 
 You're a Red Guard, one of Feron's spies. 
 Go back to the gutter, Sylvie. 
 We trusted you. 
 Sylvie... 
 Léon! 
 I will make sure that justice is done. 
 Do you really expect me to believe that after everything that's happened to my friends, my own father? 
 Take this burden upon yourself, and it will never lift. 
 Revenge yourself, and a part of you dies with him. 
 [Gunshot] 
 An honourable death. 
 What have you done? 
 He betrayed us! 
 He betrayed my father! 
 You can not do that! 
 We put this man inside the settlement some months ago. 
 He's been most useful, but too much time in low company must have corrupted him. 
 He obviously saw an opportunity to organize the theft of Beaufort's grain, blame the refugees. 
 Do you take us for fools? 
 Your death will not be honourable. 
 Not today. 
 Not today. 
 Marcheaux is a disgrace to his uniform. 
 He should be court-martialled. 
 Whatever you think he may have done, you don't have any proof. 
 You say the alleged Red Guard agent is dead? 
 Shot by Captain Marcheaux. 
 An unfortunate accident. 
 The Musketeers' intervention was directly responsible for the tragedy. 
 That's a lie. 
 The prisoners are to be released. 
 But where is the grain? 
 You want grain? 
 We've got plenty. 
 Will you tell the king, Feron? 
 Or shall I? 
 Time to get up, darling. 
 The day's begun. 
 Mama is coming to get you. 
 Oh. 
 I didn't realize you were here. 
 Yes, I like to be here when he wakes up. 
 Come, give Papa a kiss. 
 Good morning, Papa. 
 Hmm. 
 Doesn't my little prince want his mama this morning? 
 Poor Mama. 
 I will leave you, then. 
 I did not tell you, the Musketeers have returned to Paris, all four of them. 
 It seems the life of a celibate monk didn't suit Aramis. 
 I'm sure we all could've told him that. 
 Don't you think, my dear? 
 [Door opening] 
 I was mad to believe this deception of yours would work. 
 We should have taken the King's money when it was offered. 
 But, my dear sir, you've got your grain. 
 And Louis will pay you in the usual way. 
 The king wants a gesture. 
 He wants me to give it to the people of Paris. All of it! 
 The Musketeers have taken everything! 
 Feron and I will deal with them. 
 Did that creature just speak to me? 
 Did he have the audacity to open his mouth in my presence after everything he has put me through? 
 If I ever see either you or that... thing again, you'll regret it. 
 I told you, Grimaud. 
 He is a favourite of the king's, a very important man. 
 ♪ 
 Are you listening to me? 
 Control at all times, Feron. 
 [Laughing] 
 Thank you. 
 So you mean to stay here? 
 Well, there's no reason to leave now. 
 Be careful. 
 I don't do careful. 
 You know where I am. 
 [Chuckling] 
 She told me she was choosy about who she kisses. 
 Well, she can't be that choosy. 
 Quite the opposite. 
 [Chuckling] 
 I hear the people of Saint Antoine have you to thank for the return of their stolen grain. 
 Mm. 
 I'd like to shake your hand. 
 Fine animal. 
 Andalusian? 
 Recently acquired, a bargain, practically stole it. 
 [Chuckling] 
 Have we met? 
 No, I am a concerned citizen. 
 Perhaps our paths will cross again.
