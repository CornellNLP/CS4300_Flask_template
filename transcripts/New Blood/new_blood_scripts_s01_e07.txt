 It's perfect. As long as you don't get blind drunk or high on drugs. 
 You need to speak to my head of programming. 
 His name's William Gardner. 
 Kumalah arrived in London a few minutes ago. 
 Keep an eye on him. I want to know everyone he meets. 
 'Welcome to England, Mr Kumalah.' 
 Thank you. 
 What exactly are you asking me to do, Michael? 
 Investigate my own wife? 
 I think that's exactly what I'm asking you to do. 
 You have no idea how I've been counting the hours. 
 What you are doing, what you have done, it's amazing. 
 We did it together, David. 
 Which is why we should be together. 
 You should leave now! 
 11, 12, 13! 
 Just relax. 
 His name is John Malik. 
 And he is going to lead us to Daniel Lorca. 
 The SFO and the police, they're wasting their time chasing after Daniel Lorca. 
 This is a man who consorts with major criminals. 
 Mr Lorca doesn't have any friends. 
 Can I have some help, please? Cardiac arrest. 
 One of your patients, Michael Freeland, died last night. 
 I gave him the right dose. 
 We don't believe so. 
 You should perhaps consider taking legal advice. 
 David Kumalah is a rising star of East African politics. 
 In London for an international conference, he's ruffled feathers with his controversial views on aid. 
 You give a country 5,000 mosquito nets, what does that do to the local factory that might be employing people to make them? 
 You give a country free food, how exactly does that help the local farmers? 
 'But surely your position is untenable. Your country receives millions of pounds of donations from charities, such as Our Child in the UK.' 
 What's he saying? 
 Shh. 
 'We are very grateful to the British people,' and for charities such as Our Child, for everything they've done for us. 
 But aid leads to corruption. It leads to aid dependency. 
 Are you saying your own government is corrupt? 
 Of course not. All I am saying is that a constant supply of free money will test any country's honesty. 
 And there's always a danger that it will actually end up keeping the wrong people in power. 
 David Kumalah with some very controversial views. Thank you. 
 How can he say that? 
 How can he be so ungrateful, after all the money you've given him? 
 As a matter of fact, I think he's right. 
 What? 
 I think he has a point. 
 There has to be a better way to bring about change, that's all he's saying. 
 You know, Lisa, since you met this man... 
 What? 
 .. I don't feel like I know you any more. 
 David Kumalah is a visionary, Paul. 
 He's made me see things differently, that's all. 
 Have you seen him in London? 
 Not yet. 
 You're getting too close to him. 
 What are you talking about? 
 Lisa Douglas. 
 Thank you. 
 Lisa, what is it? 
 It's Michael. He...

 I have to advise you, William, that your victim, Michael Freeland, died last night. 
 It's nowt to do with me. 
 You broke into his flat. 
 No. 
 Jewellery, watches, laptops, artwork. 
 Your place is quite an Aladdin's cave. 
 You want to tell us all about it? 
 You work for AJ Alarms. 
 You used your programming skills to bypass the systems and rip off your clients. 
 Other ones, yeah, but not him. 
 26 Lorimer Gardens. 
 I never went there! 
 You're lying. 
 You broke in, he came down and surprised you, you stuck a knife in him, and now he's dead. 
 No! I swear to you, you've got it wrong. It wasn't me! 
 Well, don't just sit there. 
 Well, what...? 
 He's your age. You talk to him. 
 Yeah, um... 
 You want a drink? 
 I can get you a coffee or... or a sandwich. 
 Wait a minute. I meant ask him questions, don't offer him lunch. 
 You've got a good job. How did you get into all this? 
 I don't think you stabbed anyone. 
 But if we're going to convince my DS, you're going to have to help me. 
 I needed money. 
 Why? 
 I gamble. 
 Casinos? 
 Online. 
 How much do you owe? 
 30K. 
 You must think I'm an idiot. 
 Yes. 
 I think you're an addict. 
 I think you need help. 
 Started stealing to pay my debts. But I never hurt anyone. 
 I swear to you. I never went anywhere near Lorimer Gardens. 
 That's very good, Derek. Fast work. 
 Thanks, guv. 
 He's admitted to all seven. And the stabbing? 
 He's holding out on Lorimer Gardens. 
 He's scared, but we'll get there in the end. 
 Oh, guv! Oh... Sarge. 
 I don't think it was him. 
 What-What you going on about? 
 I've got the CCTV footage. Lorimer Gardens. No sign of Gardner. 
 But there were two other people there. 
 Jehovah's Witnesses. 
 When you retrieved a whole lot of stuff from Gardner's flat, did you find anything to tie him in with Lorimer Gardens? 
 No. He didn't take anything. He didn't get the chance. 
 Well, you searched his flat. You must have found something. 
 Missing laptop? 
 Is there any blood on his clothes? 
 No. 
 No forensics? 
 No. 
 Derek... 
 What was the name of the nurse that looked after Freeland after he was stabbed? 
 According to the report, it was a Leila Sayyad. 
 Any relation? 
 She's my sister. 
 Oh. 
 Funny how it goes, isn't it? 
 If he didn't kill Freeland, then maybe she did. 
 Maybe it WAS me. 
 Maybe I got the settings wrong. I don't know. I can't remember. 
 Oh, come on. 
 He was nearly stabbed to death the night before and then, what, he dies from a massive drug overdose? 
 Just tell us again what happened. 
 'I had the potassium chloride, which I'd brought from the dispensary. 
 'I unlocked the machine and set the dosage, and then he woke up.' 
 Could anyone have changed the settings? 
 Paul and Lisa Douglas were the only other people in the room. 
 Unless... 
 There was something Lisa Douglas said. 
 What was that? 
 Hi. 
 Just got to give him this. 
 What is it? 
 Potassium chloride. 
 Raised blood pressure? 
 Yes. 
 It struck me at the time. 
 She wouldn't have known that unless she'd had medical training. 
 Maybe she'd worked as a nurse. 
 The hospital is going to want to charge you with manslaughter by gross negligence. We have to be prepared for that. 
 And, Leila, you must get some legal advice. 
 And, Rash, you and Stefan need to find out what's really going on. 
 Dr Benson. 
 Yes. 
 Do you remember me? 
 Mrs Douglas. 
 Look, I'm very sorry. 
 It's not about that. The newspapers are about to run a story on the nurse who was working here when Michael died. 
 Leila Sayyad. 
 How do they know about her? 
 Because I told them. I had her followed. 
 I know everything about her. 
 I'm sorry? 
 I want justice for Michael. 
 The newspapers are going to name and shame. 
 They may ask you to corroborate. 
 I can't. 
 Well, I'd think about it if I were you. 
 If it isn't her, it's your neck on the line, isn't it? 
 Our Child is an incorporated and registered charity that was set up 11 years ago by Lisa Douglas, although it was founded by her husband, Paul Douglas. 
 He owns a telecommunications business. 
 You really owe me for this, Stefan. 
 Go on. 
 Well, it's raised millions of pounds. 
 It had grants from central and local government, and it's had a whole slew of celebrities who have gotten behind it. 
 Well, is it clean? 
 It's been regularly audited. It's been given a clean bill of health. 
 What exactly is it you're looking for? 
 I'm looking for a reason why its accountant, a guy called Michael Freeland, was killed. 
 Michael Freeland. 
 I know that name. 
 Yes, here. 
 Michael Freeland was the senior accountant at a firm called Carousel Securities for six years. 
 Must have been before he joined Our Child. 
 What about it? 
 Well, it might be a coincidence, but Carousel Securities was owned by John Malik. 
 This is for the SFO? 
 No. It's personal. 
 'Serious Fraud Office?' 
 Er, yeah. 
 Sorry, what's that got to do with Michael? 
 Um... 
 We're investigating someone he was associated with. 
 A man called John Malik. 
 Carousel. That's right. Michael... used to work for him. 
 Why did he leave? 
 He liked the idea of working for a charity. 
 He saw Malik just a couple of weeks ago. 
 Do you know why? 
 He said he wanted some advice. 
 Mr Freeland. 
 How are you, Samuel? 
 Haven't seen you in a while. 
 Is Mr Malik here. 
 How is...? 
 Our Child. 
 Our Child. That's right. Must keep you busy. 
 I need to see Mr Malik. It's important. 
 He said it was important. Don't know any more than that. 
 Look, this... really isn't a very good time for me, so... 
 I'm sorry. Do the numbers 11, 12, 13 mean anything to you? 
 No. Why? Should they? 
 According to the nurse who was with him in the hospital, that was the last thing he said. 
 Was that the nurse who killed him? 
 Yes, they told me there's going to be an investigation, that it was her fault. 
 She gave him the wrong dose. 
 It's thanks to her that Michael is dead. 
 Working late? 
 Marcus, come in. 
 You fancy a whisky? 
 I didn't know you had any. 
 For emergencies. 
 Malik? 
 Yes. 
 He hasn't managed to overturn the warrant yet. 
 It's just a matter of time. 
 Particularly if we have nothing on Lorca. 
 Has Stefan got nowhere? 
 Stefan got attacked... in the Turkish hammam. 
 He was looking for Daniel Lorca. And now the trail has gone cold. 
 Oh, God. 
 You should go home. 
 No, no, no. 
 I've got... masses of work to catch up on. 
 Is that true? 
 You miss him? 
 Yeah. 
 I understand. 
 So, Stefan, hm, yes, he's asked for a referral. 
 For a new job? 
 No, no, no, he's just moving flat. 
 You like him, don't you? 
 He has his uses. 
 Keep him under control. 
 I can't afford any more problems right now. 
 You OK? 
 No. 
 I can't believe this has happened. 
 I can kiss med school goodbye. 
 You're going back to uni? 
 That was the plan. 
 We'll get there. 
 So, um, did Michael Freeland have any enemies? 
 John Malik. 
 What about him? 
 Freeland went to see him a couple of weeks before he was killed. 
 Right. What did he want? 
 Why don't we ask? 
 Michael Freeland. 
 He was your accountant at Carousel. 
 I know who he was, young man. 
 You don't have to tell me. 
 Have we met? 
 I don't think so. 
 Well, that's funny. 
 I never forget a face. 
 And I'm sure I have seen you somewhere before. 
 Er... Mr Malik, would you mind answering the question? 
 And what question was that? 
 Did you see Michael Freeland? 
 Yes. He came to see me. 
 It was a Thursday, the week before last. 
 What did he want? 
 Freeland? 
 I've found something and I don't know what to do. 
 I've come to you because... Well, don't get me wrong, you know about these things. You have experience. 
 Could you look through these accounts from Our Child, in confidence? I shouldn't have taken them, but I need to be sure. 
 There's something that doesn't make sense. 
 I don't know, maybe they do things differently there. 
 I don't want to hurt anyone. I don't want to cause any trouble, but I need your advice. 
 I'm not sure I can remember. 
 Mr Malik, Michael Freeland died three days ago. 
 I'm well aware of that. 
 Wait a minute. 
 You remember he was here. 
 You remember what day he came here. 
 You don't remember what he said? 
 He was attacked in his home. 
 His laptop was taken. 
 It really might help us to know what was on his mind. 
 DC Sayyid, was it? 
 Sayyad. And I showed you my warrant card, yes. 
 I didn't see his. 
 Mr Malik, we are just trying to get information that will help us with a murder enquiry. 
 Well, I'm afraid I can't help you. I'm sorry. 
 Yes, he did come to see me. We had a chat and a drink. 
 But he didn't say anything that might be of any help to you. 
 He didn't leave anything with you? 
 I'm very busy. Why don't you show yourselves out? 
 Where the hell is my luggage? 
 Here, sir. 
 Well, don't keep me waiting. 
 He was at the airport carrying my luggage. 
 'And outside my house on a bike during the raid.' 
 He is SFO. 
 He is with the bloody SFO. 
 Working with the police? 
 No. No. 
 What did he say his name was? 
 Stefan Kowolski. 
 I want to know everything about him. 
 Find out what he is doing and where he lives. 
 He knew who I was. 
 I thought you said he'd never seen you. 
 I was at the airport the day we raided. I followed him home. 
 We are running out of time. 
 Why do you say that? 
 Look... 
 "Dr Benson admitted that he'd left the trauma nurse on her own after she insisted she was capable of operating the infusion pump without supervision." 
 That's a complete lie. That's not how it happened. 
 Just be grateful for small mercies, Leila. 
 At least he hasn't told them your name. 
 Why are you hiding? Are you guilty? 
 Take a seat. 
 I have already spoken to the police. 
 We know that, Mrs Douglas. 
 We just wanted to ask a few more questions about Michael Freeland. 
 Please, go ahead. 
 Before he died, Michael said something. 
 Three numbers. 
 Yeah. 
 '11, 12, 13. I heard him.' 
 Do you know what he meant? 
 'Yeah, I do, I do. 
 'Well, there are 11 million homeless children in Africa,' 
 12% of whom are very likely to die before they reach the age of 13. 
 11, 12, 13. It was the name of a charity drive we were considering, but then dropped. 
 Really? It doesn't sound very likely. 
 Are you suggesting that I'm lying to you? 
 Why did you drop it? 
 Because it wasn't memorable enough. 
 You remembered it. 
 Well, I would, wouldn't I? 
 Your car is here, Lisa. 
 Oh, thank you, Wendy. 
 Well, I'm so sorry I can't help you. 
 I have a lunch. 
 You remembered it. 
 She was definitely hiding something. 
 I know she was. 
 But? 
 What is it she's not telling us? 
 Oh, we're getting nowhere. I've got to get back to work. 
 Keep walking. 
 What? 
 Don't stop. 
 Those guys in the car. 
 Don't look. 
 What? 
 Those two guys, I've seen them before, on the CCTV. 
 They were outside Michael Freeland's house the night he got stabbed. 
 So what are they doing here? 
 Look... 
 OK. 
 OK, what are we going to do? 
 Just wait. 
 Whoa... 
 We've got to follow that car. 
 Right, how? 
 Taxi! 
 Follow that car. 
 You're not being serious? 
 What? 
 "Follow that car"? 
 Look, just do it, all right? I'm a police officer. 
 No, you're not. 
 Yes, I am. 
 I don't believe you. 
 Right. Well, it makes no difference you're still paying the fare. 
 Come on! 
 How much money do you have? 
 Well... Nine quid. 
 Same. 
 It's not enough. 
 OK, we've only got 18 quid, so we have to owe you the rest. 
 Forget it. I don't do credit. 
 We just showed you ID. 
 It's not my problem. 
 All right, just drop us off when you get to 18 quid. 
 Done! Go on, get out. 
 Thanks, mate! 
 
 
 
 Come on, man. Come on, we're going to lose them. 
 Lisa. 
 I've been thinking about what you were saying. 
 About leaving with you. 
 That's very sudden. Aren't you even going to order? 
 Excuse me, could I have a gin martini, please? 
 Of course, madam. 
 See, I worried about Paul. He's been asking questions. 
 I think he knows about us. 
 I can deal with Paul. 
 But we don't have much time. I'm leaving tomorrow. 
 So soon? 
 Everything is in place. We have all the support we need. 
 I just have to press the button. 
 We're going to make it happen. 
 Mmm. 
 Who is he? 
 Saw him on TV. 
 Strictly? 
 No... 
 No, it was, eh, something to do with Africa on the news. 
 Surely your position is untenable, your country receives millions of pounds of donations from charities. 
 He was talking about charity. Come on. 
 Is he a regular guest at this hotel? 
 David Kumalah? 
 He stays here quite often. 
 You do know that Mr Kumulah is a government minister? 
 He has a diplomatic passport. 
 Yeah. We know. It's Mr Kumulah we're worried about. 
 Yeah, his, uh, safety. 
 Would you like me to stay? 
 Eh... no, we'd like you to go. 
 Thank you. 
 Wow. 
 Start here. 
 Excuse me. 
 What is it? 
 Get up to the room -- now. 
 I'm going to have to leave you for a moment. 
 What is it? 
 Someone's trying to access my computer. 
 It... It doesn't work, I can't get in. 
 Thought you were supposed to be good at this sort of thing? 
 I am doing my best. 
 I-I can't do it. 
 Date of birth, "1-2-3-4". 
 It's not that simple, it's going to be encrypted. 
 (Shh.) 
 Who are you and what are you doing here? 
 Mr Kumulah... 
 We're the police. 
 No, you are not. 
 I can show you my warrant card. 
 I am not interested. 
 You have broken into my room, you are attempting to access my computer whoever you are, your actions have placed you outside of the law. 
 We're, erm, we're investigating the death of Michael Freeland. 
 I don't care what you are doing, you will leave here. Now. 
 Yeah, that sounds like a good idea. 
 Right. 
 With my men. 
 They will escort you. 
 Yeah, whatever you say. 
 Whatever you say. 
 I don't like the look of this. 
 Yeah, nor do I. 
 Whoa, excuse me. I think the lobby's that way. 
 Yeah, we want to go to reception. 
 That changes things. 
 Ugh! 
 Agh! 
 This way! 
 Chairs! 
 What? 
 Just... 
 Yeah, all right, that'll do! 
 Oi! 
 Whoa! Take that. 
 What's this for? 
 I don't know, might be useful! 
 The lights! 
 Why'd you do that? 
 What? 
 You could have just turned them off. 
 But you gave me that! 
 Come on! 
 We've lost them. 
 No, we haven't! 
 Go, go, go! 
 Rash, watch it! 
 Get in! 
 Who are you? 
 Get your heads down! 
 My name's Finch, counter-terrorism. 
 Police, SFO... why are you working together? 
 You better start talking. 
 We're investigating Our Child. 
 The death of Michael Freeland? 
 That led us to Lisa Douglas. 
 And she led us to Kumulah. 
 So... why are you interested in Kumulah? 
 I'm sorry, you really think I'm going to tell you? Two boy scouts? 
 Well? 
 Forget it. 
 I don't know what the hell you think you're doing, but you may have compromised a major investigation. 
 And I'm warning you, it doesn't stop here. 
 Counter-terrorism? 
 Just had them on the phone. 
 What about? 
 Where's Sayyad? 
 I don't know. 
 What do you mean, you don't know? 
 He's not here. 
 Well, I can see that. 
 Do you know anything about a man called David Kumulah? 
 No. 
 Do you know anything about anything? 
 I want to see Sayyad. I want him back here -- now. 
 That's my boss. 
 Aren't you going to answer it? 
 I'll see him tomorrow, if I've still got a job. 
 Heard that before. 
 Gentlemen! 
 Get in. 
 Really? 
 You want to know who killed Michael Freeland. 
 I can help you. 
 He came to see me. You know that. 
 He had stumbled onto something and wanted my advice, and... he gave me something. 
 Now, this here is a copy of the Our Child accounts. 
 He asked me to look at them. 
 Why didn't you tell us before? 
 Because I didn't know who you were. 
 I do now. 
 And there's something I want. 
 Go on. 
 A DVD. It's marked "Bermuda". 
 It was taken from my house... by your friends at the Serious Fraud Office. 
 It has nothing to do with them. 
 So, erm, what's on it? 
 Images of me and my wife on holiday. 
 You can watch the whole thing if you have to, but I want it back. 
 Some of it is, er... intimate. 
 What? You mean... 
 .. p0rn? 
 Don't sneer at me, you little guttersnipe. 
 They are private pictures taken in private, and the SFO has no right to have them. 
 I want them back. 
 Holiday pictures. 
 Yeah. 
 It's a straightforward swap. 
 Otherwise this conversation never took place, and you can go and whistle in the wind. 
 You're in early. 
 What are you doing with that? 
 I was watching it. 
 It belongs to John Malik. 
 Yeah, he wants it back. 
 And he asked you to get it? 
 Well, it's just holiday pictures, I've watched the whole thing. 
 It's evidence, Stefan, it belongs to the SFO, you really think you can walk in here and take it? 
 You think I'd do that, Eleanor? 
 Is that what you think? 
 So... did you look at it? 
 Yep. 
 And? 
 You had a lovely holiday. 
 All right. 
 Thank you. 
 There's nothing on the DVD, so why does he want it back so much? 
 What is it he's not telling me? 
 John Malik IS Daniel Lorca. 
 He's the one who runs the company. 
 Lorca has the house, the clothes, the delivery, he goes to the Turkish hammam. 
 But it's all just a shell to make him look real. 
 It's the perfect fraud. A fraudster that doesn't even exist. 
 And now we have everything we need. 
 This is what Michael Freeland found in the accounts. 
 Someone has been stealing money -- a lot of it. 
 How? 
 Over the past three years, Our Child have made payments totalling £15 million to six companies in six different countries. 
 Here they are. 
 Montsowarra Construction -- six million. 
 Karampa Medical Foundation three million. 
 Mafinda Educational Supplies and so on. 
 But they were all incorporated on the same day. 
 That's not possible. 
 Look at the dates. 
 11th of December 2013... 
 11th of December 2013. 
 11, 12, 13. 
 That's what he was trying to explain. They're all fake. 
 Fake companies. 
 The money goes in... 
 They take it out. 
 And in the meantime, they've got counter-terrorism coming after them. 
 What are you two involved in exactly? 
 Did you just say counter-terrorism? You should drop this NOW. 
 Arash Sayyad is a TDC and Stefan Kowolski is a junior at the SFO. 
 They don't even work together. 
 So... Well, what are the two of them doing tied up with Kumulah? 
 Nearly getting themselves killed investigating the death of the Our Child accountant. 
 You know, if these two kids manage to get themselves knocked off... that could be our way in. 
 Back at the car park... it would have been better if I'd never intervened. 
 Yeah. 
 If they rub up against Kumulah again, it's probably better you back off. 
 What are you doing? 
 I'm leaving you, Paul. 
 No, you're not. 
 How much money have you given to David Kumulah? 
 That's none of your business. 
 Ohh, I should have listened to Michael. 
 The financial irregularities, they were down to you, weren't they? 
 How much money have you actually stolen, Lisa? 
 Oh, God, you really have no understanding, do you, Paul? 
 There's only way to make change in Africa, that's his genius. 
 You get rid of corrupt government, you cut out this addiction to aid and charity and you... 
 You build a country from the bottom up! 
 What are you two planning then? 
 Some kind of armed uprising? 
 Yeah, that's exactly what we're planning. 
 We're starting again. 
 We need to talk to Mrs Douglas. 
 I'm sorry, Mrs Douglas isn't working from the office today. 
 Eh, where is he? 
 She's working from home. 
 Michael found out what you were doing, didn't he? He knew. 
 And you tried to kill him. 
 No. 
 Yes, Lisa. 
 There was no burglary. 
 Michael came to see me, he was frightened, and that very same night he was stabbed. 
 That wasn't me. 
 But it was done for you. 
 And then at the hospital, when you realised he wasn't dead... 
 No, it was the nurse. 
 It was the nurse. 
 It wasn't the nurse. 
 All right, Mr Freeland, don't try to move. 
 11, 12, 13. 
 God help you, Lisa. 
 I'm leaving with David, Paul. 
 You're never going to see me again. 
 Lisa. 
 Mr Douglas? Police. 
 My wife... you have to stop them. 
 Take my car! The ambulance is on its way. 
 Come on! 
 You've got to call it in. 
 I can't, he's got diplomatic immunity. 
 Anyway, it's too late. 
 You've got to call it in! 
 They've just stabbed a man. 
 I noticed. 
 That's them, that's them. 
 We got 'em. 
 We're being followed. 
 Oh, they're turning off. 
 Do it now. 
 Gun! 
 Jesus. 
 You hurt? 
 We're upside down. 
 Yep. 
 There's something dripping down my back. 
 What's dripping down my back? 
 Oh, it's... 
 It's petrol. 
 What?! 
 It's petrol! 
 Well, I think we should get out! 
 Yeah. Definitely. 
 Come on! 
 How... could this... 
 Get any worse? 
 They're coming back! 
 Get out! 
 I can't. 
 Rash, get out! 
 Rash! 
 I can't! 
 Rash! 
 Get out! 
 Wiggle it! 
 I have wiggled it, it's stuck! 
 What's he doing?! 
 What are you doing? 
 Keep pulling! 
 I am! 
 Come on! 
 Come on! 
 I told you, I can't move. I'm stuck. 
 Yeah, I'll help. 
 Come on. 
 It's no good. 
 It's coming! 
 Go! 
 I'm not going without you! 
 I don't want to go sitting here! 
 I'm not leaving you! 
 Why do you have to be so bloody obstinate? 
 It's coming! It's coming! 
 Just go! 
 Oh, come on! 
 Come on! 
 Go! Rash! 
 Out of the car now! 
 That was close. 
 Thanks. 
 You should have just left me. 
 You're right. 
 No, I'm... You're my mate, I'd have done the same for you. 
 Hey! 
 You want to tell me what the bloody hell's going on? 
 Sarge... 
 Who's this? 
 Look, we've had another call from counterterrorism. 
 They'll handle Kumalah from now on. 
 The governor wants to see you in his office tomorrow. 
 We've got to get to a flat, sir. It's very important. 
 Can you give us a lift? 
 You've got a car. 
 No, sir! Sir! 
 Aw. 
 He's nice. 
 So much for that. 
 The flat. 
 We're too late. 
 We can call them. 
 No signal. 
 You know, just once, just once in our lives, we had to be there on time. 
 We can still make it. 
 No, we can't, it's on the other side of town. 
 We've got 40 minutes! 
 Stefan. 
 Stefan. 
 What? 
 No. 
 We can make it! 
 Stef. 
 Come on! 
 No! 
 Whoa! 
 Stop him, stop him! 
 I told you we'd make it. 
 I think we've given them long enough now. 
 Hi. 
 Sorry we're late. 
 We got held up. 
 So, why were the spooks interested in dark doings in sub-Saharan Africa? 
 Oh, politics, Derek, politics. 
 Yeah, word got out that Kumalah was organising a coup and someone higher up wanted it stopped. 
 Didn't he have diplomatic immunity? 
 Not any more. 
 Here's to him. 
 We get the credit, Derek. 
 We've done, um, very well out of it. 
 Question is, though, what are we going to do about DC Sayyad? 
 Guv. 
 His six-month probation is up next week. 
 I think he should stay. 
 I thought you would say that. 
 Investment fraud, false accounting, bribery, extortion, possession of fake ID. 
 I don't think we're going to be seeing Mr Malik again for a very long time. 
 Where is he? 
 Oh, the police released him on bail this morning, but he -- he will go down. 
 So, what is this? 
 If this is not an emergency. 
 Well, I think we're allowed to celebrate once in a while. 
 Yes, uh... mm-hmm. 
 Yes. 
 Actually, we've finished interviewing the candidates, and we came to the unanimous decision... 
 But I don't understand. 
 I mean, they were completely wrong. 
 Yes. Yes. 
 'Good.' 
 Whatever you say. 
 I'll let them know. 
 Shall we go for a drink? 
 No need to go out. 
 Present for house firing. 
 House warming. 
 Firing. 
 What is it? 
 Don't touch it. 
 Thank you. 
 Just one glass. 
 Nasdarovje. 
 Nasdarovje. 
 So, they're moving in. 
 I don't get it. 
 Why do you want them in your property? 
 Those two little bastards? 
 Yeah. 
 I'll tell you why. 
 Because I've got them where I want them. 
 Now they're paying me money. 
 But one day, I promise you, I'm really going to make them pay.
