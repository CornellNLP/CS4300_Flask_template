 Are you OK, Rash? 
 What happened? 
 We crashed. 
 Jesus. 
 Are you hurt? 
 We're upside down. 
 Yep. 
 There's something dripping down my back. 
 What's dripping down my back? 
 It's petrol. 
 What?! 
 It's petrol! 
 Well, I think we should get out! 
 Yeah, definitely. 
 How... could this... get any worse? 
 They're coming back! 
 Get out! 
 I can't! 
 Rash, get out! 
 My seatbelt! I can't! 
 Rash! Get out! 
 Get out! 
 Wiggle it! 
 I have wiggled it, it's stuck! 
 What's he doing? 
 Come on! 
 I told you, I can't move, I'm stuck! 
 Yeah, I'll help! 
 Come on. 
 It's no good. 
 It's coming! 
 Listen... Just go! 
 I'm not going without you. 
 There's no point in us both sitting here! 
 Oh, come on! 
 Look, just go! 
 I'm not leaving you! 
 Why do you have to be so bloody obstinate?! 
 It's coming, it's coming!

 Good morning. 
 Hi, I'm Arrash Sayyad. 
 Stefan Kowolski. 
 Yes, do come in. 
 Feel free to take a look around. 
 It's always nice to get a feel for the place. 
 Neither of you are smokers? 
 No. 
 The owner is very insistent about that. 
 And, of course, no animals. 
 That's you out. 
 Hm! Funny(!) 
 Who is the owner? 
 It's not an individual, it's a company. 
 You do realise it's very unusual for a property of this calibre to come onto the rental market and at such a low price? 
 Oh, excuse me. 
 We've got to take it! 
 Mate, this place is amazing! 
 Yeah. 
 All right, well, let's tell her we want it and get on with it. 
 Yeah. 
 There is... There's got to be a catch. 
 Why do you have to be so negative? 
 Cos it's too good to be true. 
 Mate, it's not... 
 Amazing view! 
 Told you. 
 Excuse me? 
 You didn't say anything about this being an open house. 
 I'm sorry. If you're interested in the property, we'll consider you for the shortlist. 
 How short exactly? 
 We'll need to check your finances and then your references and then there will be interviews with the agency. 
 For everyone, or...? 
 Not everyone. 
 Not everyone. 
 You're a detective, I'm a serious fraud investigator. 
 We're perfect. 
 Yeah. 
 As long as you don't get blind drunk or high on drugs, we'll be fine. 
 You're never going to let me forget that! 
 No. 
 It's perfect. 
 Guv? 
 Burglaries. 
 You're not serious? 
 Well, it's still a crime, Derek, or hadn't you noticed? 
 My heart bleeds for the victims, but it's not really our department, is it? 
 Six burglaries in two months, high-end apartments, all smart addresses. 
 Last week the AC had dinner at City Hall. 
 The... subject came up. 
 I get it. I suppose you want me to take Wonder Boy with me. 
 Well, you're a good team. 
 We're not a team, we are a situation. 
 Well, you're still getting results. Here, I tell you what, his six-month probation is up in two weeks. 
 Want me to send him back? 
 I'll think about it. 
 Come on. 
 What is it? 
 It's me, telling you to get on your feet and follow me, all right?! 
 But fraud isn't just about making money, it isn't about crime, it's about ruining people's lives. 
 Helen and Colin Fraser, both in their 70s, put their entire life savings into a property scheme, investing in Spain. 
 But there was no property. 
 They lost everything and then they... then they took their own lives. 
 It's a fraud that has ripped off British pensioners to the tune of 30 million since 2009. 
 And the brains behind it all is this man -- Daniel Lorca. 
 Lorca is invisible. 
 He has no address in the UK, we know almost nothing about him. 
 We don't even know what he looks like. 
 But I want to find him. 
 This is the man that is going to lead us to him. 
 His name is John Malik. 
 He is a lawyer and businessman who offers a full client service to the super-rich. 
 Oligarchs, drug traffickers, Russian Mafia, you name it. 
 John Malik represents Lorca's "legitimate" business interests. 
 But, this morning, a warrant has been signed to search his office and his home. 
 There will be two searches. 
 Alison will take the office team as temporary Case Controller and I'll take his home. 
 But I want you to be very careful. 
 Remember, this is a man who consorts with major criminals. 
 Good trip, Mr Malik? 
 You know the best thing about Moscow, Smithson? 
 No, sir. 
 Getting the hell out! 
 Where is that damn porter? 
 Here, sir. 
 Come on, don't keep me waiting. 
 Home or office, sir? 
 Office. 
 They are heading for the office. 
 'That's good, Stefan. Stay close.' 
 We'd been away for the weekend. 
 Anywhere nice? 
 Wiltshire. We've got a house near Devizes. 
 So, do you know what was taken? 
 Money, about £300. 
 Computer and... my wife's jewellery. 
 A diamond necklace, some earrings, her eternity ring. 
 Insured? 
 That's not the point, is it? It's more the sentimental value. 
 I'm sure. 
 What about the alarm? 
 Well... I was certain I'd put that on. 
 I must have been mistaken. 
 Maybe he should get it checked. 
 What? 
 The alarm. 
 That's good, that, yeah, that will be a real help... now that everything has been nicked! 
 Excuse me, have you got a minute to talk about how we can stamp out child poverty in Africa? 
 No, have you got a minute to step out of the way? 
 But w-we're raising money for disadvantaged children... 
 I've already got one, thanks. 
 I'm sorry, mate. 
 Our Child believes that every child on the planet has a right to laughter and happiness. 
 And now, ladies and gentlemen, we ask you to welcome its founder and director, Lisa Douglas. 
 Ladies and gentlemen, ten years ago, I made a promise that I would never show the picture of an unhappy boy or girl and, with your help and with the money we raise tonight, that is a promise that I mean to keep. 
 Was that all right? 
 I think it's perfect. 
 Level? 
 Fine, Mrs Douglas. 
 So, I'm speaking for five minutes? 
 It's plenty, Wendy, we've heard it all before! 
 So, five minutes, then we hand over to the band, they play their first set, then we introduce the silent auction and serve the first course. 
 People want to hear you too, Lisa. 
 I'll play the room. Which is my table? 
 Number three, over here. 
 You're sitting between the Minister and the Archbishop. 
 Mm! Sounds like a rude joke! 
 So, where's Michael? 
 He's here. 
 He was here a minute ago. 
 I can't wait any longer, I'm going to the police. 
 Look, Michael, why are you bringing this to me now? 
 You're the chair of trustees, Paul, you're responsible. 
 Look, I'm not doubting your allegations. 
 There is clearly an irregularity in the Our Child accounts, but maybe you should consider the question of timing. 
 What do you mean? 
 Tonight is the gala, it's the biggest night of the year for Lisa. 
 I know, I've just come from there. 
 Then why raise this now? 
 I raised this a week ago, you've done nothing. 
 Look, what exactly are you asking me to do, Michael? 
 Investigate my own wife? 
 Yes. 
 I think that's exactly what I'm asking you to do. 
 Look, give me a few more days. Is that too much to ask? 
 Let's get this gala out of the way and then we can take look at it. 
 Thank you. 
 Have you told anybody else about this? 
 No-one. 
 Alex? 
 I never talk about my work at home. 
 And there are no copies? 
 It's all on my laptop. 
 Right. 
 Could you please move away from your desks and do not touch your computers. 
 We will be issuing receipts for everything we take. 
 What's going on? 
 You are? 
 Samuel Armstrong, I'm Mr Malik's office manager. 
 My name is Alison White, I am a case controller with the Serious Fraud Office. 
 I have in my possession a warrant authorising the Serious Fraud Office to search these premises. 
 What are you talking about? Search them for what? 
 No phone calls, please. 
 We will do this as quickly as we can. 
 Mr Malik, you might want to steer clear of the office. 
 We've got company. 
 Forget about the office, we are heading home. 
 sh1t. 
 Sir? 
 No chance. 
 Someone's tipped him off, he's on his way home. 
 It will take him 30 minutes in this traffic. 
 I'll be right behind him. 
 Excuse me! That's got nothing to do with John, that belongs to me. You can't take that. 
 That cabinet was marked international accounts. 
 It wasn't in the cabinet. 
 It was on it. 
 John! 
 Log it with the rest. 
 Sure. 
 John! I'm so sorry! 
 It's all right, it's all right... 
 I couldn't stop them! 
 Don't upset yourself, it's not your fault. 
 Typical of you, Marcus -- wait until I'm out of the way and then sneak in the back door. 
 I'm looking for your client, Daniel Lorca. 
 And you think you'll find him here? 
 Do you know where he is? 
 I haven't the faintest idea. 
 Even if I did know, do you think I'd tell you? 
 Are you all done here? 
 Thank you, Mr Malik. 
 "Mr Malik"! 
 It was "John" when you were drinking my champagne. 
 Well, that was then. 
 Gone up in the world, have you, Marcus? 
 Or is it down? 
 You have a warrant to search my premises, I take it? 
 I gave the paperwork to your wife. 
 Susan is not up to reading the small print, but I promise you I will, every last word. 
 You know him? 
 I knew him once. 
 Bastards! 
 What are they looking for? 
 Daniel Lorca. 
 Who is Lorca? 
 He's a client, he's no-one. 
 John, there's something that I need to tell you. 
 What? 
 You know the Bermuda DVD? 
 What, they took it?! 
 That's what I'm trying to tell you... 
 You let them take it?! 
 I tried to stop them, but they just... 
 Stupid bitch! 
 It is an amazing place -- two bedrooms, balcony, near the Tube. 
 Where? 
 Stratford. 
 That's great, Rash. 
 I'm really happy for you. 
 No, you're not. 
 Come on, what is it? 
 Well I'll... miss you. 
 Will you? 
 Of course. 
 You should get your own place. 
 With who? 
 I'm not going anywhere. 
 Actually, I'm applying to medical school. 
 What, you'll leave the hospital? 
 I want to be a doctor. 
 I think it's great. 
 You should go for it. 
 Hi. 
 Hi. 
 What are you doing?! 
 I was just passing, I saw you through the window. 
 No, you weren't, I told you I was going to be here. 
 Hi, Leila. 
 Nice to see you, Stefan. 
 Why didn't you join us? 
 He didn't invite me. 
 That's right. 
 What are you doing here? 
 All right! I'm just being friendly! 
 Have you... finished with them? 
 Go ahead. 
 So, have you told her? 
 Yes. 
 Have you told your flatmates? 
 No, that's different. 
 Why? 
 They're Polish. 
 They get very emotional. 
 Really? 
 Yeah, I'm just going to move out and hope they don't notice. 
 I've got to go, I've got the night shift. 
 I'll leave you two together. 
 Yeah, I'll pay(!) 
 Thanks. 
 I really like her. 
 OK. 
 That's not going to work out. 
 Why not? 
 Because we are living together. 
 Maybe I'll move out. 
 Are you buying? 
 I've already got mine. 
 I'll have a scotch. 
 Are you getting any nuts? 
 What sort of nuts? 
 Cashews. 
 I've got peanuts. 
 That'll do. 
 Ta. 
 Thanks, Derek. 
 You're welcome. 
 How are you getting on, then? 
 Burglaries? 
 Oh, it's what I joined the police for in the first place. 
 Meet interesting rich people who've had stuff nicked I couldn't even afford. 
 Have you seen anyone about this depression of yours, eh? 
 Job makes me depressed. 
 Maybe you've been in it too long. 
 You trying to tell me something? 
 I'm just trying to cheer you up. 
 Have a nut. 
 Listen, Lisa, I need to talk to you about something. 
 What? 
 Erm, Michael came to see me today. 
 He's a bit worried about something to do with the accounts. 
 Oh, not now, Paul. I mean, do you mind? 
 Yeah, well, if not now, then when? 
 I never see you these days. 
 You're always off in some world of your own. 
 I'm busy. 
 No, there's more to it than that. 
 There's something you're not telling me. 
 Can we just get through tonight, please? 
 Thank you. 
 Over here, thank you! 
 Thank you, this way, this way. 
 Will you be all right? 
 Yeah. 
 What is it? 
 What? 
 You've hardly said a word all evening. 
 I'm sorry. 
 What is it you're not telling me, Michael? 
 Why did you go back to see your old boss last week? 
 I've found something and I don't know what to do. 
 I've come to you because... 
 Well, don't get me wrong, you know about these things. 
 You have experience. 
 I wonder if you could look at these accounts from Our Child. 
 You know we don't talk about work. 
 We do if there's something wrong. 
 You should have gone to the gala. 
 Hm? Why didn't you? 
 Black tie... champagne... celebs. 
 I didn't feel like it. 
 I'm tired. 
 I'll clear up. 
 You go to bed. 
 OK. 
 What is it? 
 I thought I heard something. 
 What? 
 Downstairs. 
 It's nothing. 
 I'm going down. 
 I'll come. 
 No, it's OK. Go back to sleep. 
 Alex! 
 My husband's upstairs. He'll be calling the police. 
 You should leave -- now! 
 He's been stabbed. He's got multiple lacerations on his back. 
 He's bleeding internally and I think his liver's been punctured. 
 There was burglars. It happened in the flat. 
 I'm afraid I'm going to have to ask you to leave. 
 We'll take care of him. Leila! 
 Yeah. 
 We need to stabilise him. He's bleeding fast. 
 He's got a weak, rapid pulse. 
 I'll fast-bleep the vascular surgeons. 
 He'll need to go to theatre. 
 Yeah, get onto it. 
 Those burglaries you're investigating. 
 Yes, guv. 
 It's now attempted murder. 
 Are you happy? 
 Yes, guv. 
 With ticket sales and the silent auction, our gala last night raised the amazing sum of £420,000! 
 Thank you, everyone. That's all down to your effort. 
 It's a fantastic result. 
 And to those of you who weren't invited, I'm sorry, it was a fabulous evening, too. 
 So let's get back to work. 
 Lisa? 
 Mm. 
 Paul is in your office. 
 OK. 
 Paul. 
 What is it? 
 Lisa, I've got some bad news. 
 It's Michael. 
 What? 
 Alex just called. Michael's in hospital. 
 He was stabbed last night. 
 Apparently there was some kind of a burglary in his home. 
 Why did he call you? Why didn't he call me? 
 Is that really the issue? 
 No, of course not, I didn't mean that. 
 How is he? 
 Well, I called the hospital. 
 He's in critical condition. 
 It was a brutal attack in his home. 
 Lisa, he's your chief accountant, for God's sake. 
 I told you yesterday he was worried about something and now this. 
 Yeah. 
 Do you think it's just a coincidence? 
 What else could it be? 
 What are you suggesting? 
 I don't know, Lisa. You tell me. 
 Look, we raised nearly half a million pounds last night. 
 Do you have any idea what difference that's going to make? 
 You just don't get it, do you? 
 No, Lisa, I don't. 
 Two men, married. 
 I suppose that sort of thing doesn't bother you. 
 Uh, no. 
 Does it bother you, Sarge? 
 Of course it doesn't. Why should it? 
 Anyway, it's none of your bloody business. 
 
 
 
 There's not much to say. 
 Michael heard something. 
 It woke him up and he came downstairs. 
 And you didn't come down with your, erm...? 
 My husband. 
 No, I'm a much heavier sleeper. 
 I heard him call out to me and then there was silence, so I came down. 
 He was in there. 
 There was a lot of blood. 
 I was shocked, I didn't know what to do. 
 I dialled 999. 
 Has anything been taken? 
 Well, I haven't had much chance to look. 
 But I don't think so. 
 They broke a few things. 
 Oh, his laptop was taken. 
 He must have surprised them. 
 He works for a charity, hm? 
 Our Child, yes. 
 How long has he been there? 
 About two years. 
 He's not happy at work. He's... been having problems. That's why he couldn't sleep. 
 Does he talk about his work? 
 Not much. 
 We try not to. 
 I notice you have a burglar alarm. 
 Was it on last night? 
 It should have been. 
 Michael usually put it on before he went to bed. 
 And is it working? 
 I don't know. 
 It was fine a week ago, but if it didn't go off... 
 But I don't know. 
 Ayjay Alarms. 
 Really? 
 Eh, seven burglaries in the last two months. 
 Three of the properties have the same alarm system, including this one. 
 Oh, thanks for pointing that out, Sayyad, I'm sure I would never have noticed(!) 
 Sorry, Sarge... 
 Yeah, but you're not, are you? 
 That's your problem -- you think you're God's gift to modern policing. 
 Well, you're not, you're just a bloody TDC. 
 I'm just trying to do my job. 
 Exactly, so stop trying to do mine. 
 Here you go. 
 Thanks. 
 Lorca? 
 Yes, well, the SFO aren't the police, they are just a bunch of glorified accountants with a high opinion of themselves, and they're wasting their time chasing after Daniel Lorca. 
 But they've got something. 
 That's right. The Bermuda DVD. 
 Susan should never have let them take it. 
 It's a holiday resort, for God's sake. 
 It's also a tax haven. 
 It doesn't matter what it is. I want it back. 
 What are you looking for? 
 I'll know when I've found it. 
 Marcus, you didn't tell me you knew Malik. 
 I didn't think it was relevant. 
 Well, it might be. 
 He's asked for a meeting. 
 So? 
 I think he's going to use his association to overturn the warrant -- or at least he's going to try. 
 And if he's successful, anything we find will be inadmissible. 
 He won't. 
 I worked for him, that's all. 
 You should have mentioned it before. 
 I didn't think it mattered. 
 Of course it matters, he can use it against us. 
 Stefan. 
 I think I might have found something. 
 What is it? 
 Well, John Malik does a lot of big stuff for his clients -- contracts, acquisitions, that sort of thing. 
 But he also does small stuff too -- tickets to Ascot, opera, car rentals. 
 And? 
 I was looking through the invoices and I found this. 
 12 vintage bottles of champagne. 
 Bought on behalf of Daniel Lorca. 
 There's an address for delivery, a place in Notting Hill. 
 I thought I might take a look. 
 Yes, you do that. 
 And, Stefan... well done. 
 Detective Sergeant Sands, DC Sayyad. 
 How can I help? 
 You're Ayjay Kapour? This is your business? 
 It's a family business, yeah. 
 Can you confirm you installed burglar alarms at these addresses? 
 Er, yeah, I believe so. 
 I can't be sure -- we install hundreds of alarms every year. 
 Oh. Obviously not up to much, are they? 
 Why do you say that? 
 14 Waldegrave Mansions, 26 Lorimer Gardens, 3 Kenville Terrace -- they've all been burgled. 
 There's nothing wrong with our products. 
 Another three addresses here. 
 They have different alarm systems but it turns out they all have maintenance agreements with you. 
 Why are you showing me this? 
 Why do you think? 
 They've all been burgled too. 
 And in each case, the alarm system was miraculously deactivated. 
 This is very worrying. 
 I'm sure it is. 
 Look, I can't help you, Mr Sands. 
 You need to speak to my head of programming. 
 Who might that be? 
 His name is William Gardner. William! 
 Yeah? 
 What kept you? 
 You're losing your touch! 
 How's he doing? 
 Generally, he's fine. 
 He's still very sleepy and his potassium levels are a bit low. 
 He could be hypokalaemic from the blood transfusion he received. 
 Are you still going ahead with medical school? 
 I was going to ask you for a reference. 
 I'll be glad to do that. 
 Thanks. 
 In the meantime, let's give him 10ml of potassium chloride per hour over five hours and see where we are after that. 
 OK. 
 Excuse me, do you think it might be possible to see Michael Freeland, please? 
 Are you family? 
 I'm Lucy Douglas, Michael works for me. 
 I understand, but Michael's in a very critical condition, Mrs Douglas. They are only allowing immediate family to visit him. 
 We just spoke to his partner and we are sort of family. 
 Yeah, we'd only be a few minutes. 
 All right. 
 Take a seat. 
 Mr Freeland's files. 
 I haven't eaten since breakfast. 
 Do you think you could handle the infusion? 
 Yeah. 
 I've done it before, I know what to do. 
 Thanks, Leila, that's great. 10ml per hour over five hours. 
 Right. OK. 
 Can I get you something? 
 No, I'm all right, thanks. 
 Hi, sorry to disturb you both. 
 Just got to give him this. 
 What is it? 
 Potassium chloride. 
 Raised blood pressure. 
 Yes. 
 Is that serious? 
 No, it's what you'd expect after surgery. 
 So, are you going to stay with him all night? 
 No, only until midnight. 
 Don't worry, I'll be having a word with the nurse coming in. 
 Alex! 
 Shh, relax, Mr Freeland. Stay calm, try not to move. 
 11, 12, 13... 
 Just relax. 
 11, 12, 13... 
 What is it? 
 I don't understand. 
 11, 12... 
 Shh. 
 Tell him! 
 Just relax. 
 11, 12... 
 Is he OK? 
 Don't worry, he's still under a lot of sedation. 
 His pulse is stabilising. 
 He'll be all right. 
 So, I've got news. 
 Yeah? 
 We got it. 
 The flat? 
 No, the interview. 
 We're on the shortlist, but we've got to be at the estate agent's after work on Tuesday, all right? Five o'clock. 
 And there's three others. 
 Three others? 
 Yeah. 
 We're in. 
 Mr Lorca? 
 That's me, yeah. 
 What? 
 I locked myself out. 
 What? 
 It's my London pad. 
 I can get the lock open for you, but I can't let you in without seeing ID. 
 Oh, my ID's inside. 
 But it's all right, he's a police officer. 
 What?! 
 Stop saying "what" and show him your warrant card! 
 Detective... Constable... Sayyad. 
 You know this man? 
 Yeah. 
 Right. 
 What's all this about? 
 It's SFO, it's all right. 
 No, it's not all right. This... 
 This is breaking and entering. 
 If I'm found in here I'm going to get booted out. Again! 
 No-one's going to find out. 
 How can you do this to me? 
 There you are. I'll send a bill to this address. 
 I knew I shouldn't have come out with you. 
 What are we doing here? 
 We are looking for a man called Daniel Lorca. 
 I thought we were going to the pub. 
 He's a fraudster. He's a crook. 
 Two old people killed themselves because of him. 
 What old people? 
 It doesn't matter, we're trying to find him. 
 Right, and he lives here? 
 He had 12 bottles of champagne delivered here a month ago. 
 Nothing in the fridge. 
 Oven's brand-new. 
 None of this stuff's ever been used. 
 Maybe he just bought it. 
 You just said he had champagne delivered here a month ago! 
 OK, er... 
 Let's try upstairs. 
 Stefan... 
 I told you. No-one actually lives here. 
 Bed's never been slept in. Toilet's never been used. 
 Do you mind if we get out of here before someone comes? 
 No-one's going to come. 
 Look, there's got to be something. 
 Bonhams... wine-tasting... 
 What about this? 
 A hammam? 
 Yeah, it's a Turkish bath. 
 Yeah. I know what it is. 
 I don't believe this. 
 How did they know we were here? 
 I don't know how they knew we were here, Stefan. 
 Maybe there's an alarm. Maybe the neighbours saw us. 
 That doesn't matter. 
 What matters is, WHAT are we going to tell them? 
 It's all right. It's all right, I've got him. 
 What? 
 Oh, I'm DC Sayyad. 
 I've been investigating a series of burglaries with my boss, DS sands. He's on the way with backup. 
 Who is this, then? 
 He's... 
 Please... I see empty house. I do nothing wrong. 
 Oh, be quiet, you, all right? Um... 
 I'm on top of this. 
 I'm all right. House is secure. 
 'Alpha 26 to the Rose and Crown on Alma Street. 
 'Immediate response required.' 
 Wait. 
 He was here. 
 Who? 
 Daniel Lorca. 
 Why would he keep an empty house? What's the point? 
 He had the champagne delivered here a month ago, and... this. 
 What's... 
 No. Forget it. 
 You can go if you want, I'm not interested. 
 I've had enough. 
 I shouldn't have bothered, should I? Trying to argue with you. 
 You still talked me into it. 
 You might enjoy it. 
 I might not. 
 Hi. 
 Merhaba! 
 Yes? 
 Oh, we booked the Discovery package. 
 What's your name, please? 
 Stefan Kowolski. 
 With a K. 
 Yes, Mr Kowolski. 
 I see you paid in advance. 
 Is this your first time here? 
 Yeah. 
 Eren? 
 Eren will look after you. 
 Thanks. 
 Thanks. 
 By the way, a friend of mine comes here from time to time. 
 Daniel Lorca. 
 Lorca? 
 He hasn't visited recently, has he? 
 I'm afraid I don't know him. 
 Thank you. 
 Follow me, please. 
 Yep. 
 Mr Malik. 
 Thank you, Yusef. Just deal with that for me, would you? 
 Eleanor Davies will see you shortly. 
 Admit it... you're enjoying this. 
 No. I'm not enjoying it. 
 I'm hot, I'm sweating, and I should be at work. 
 Well, the Discovery package comes with free mint tea. 
 Look, this is a complete waste of time. 
 Even assuming Lorca does come here, how are you going to find him? 
 I'll ask around. 
 Right, but you can ask around without me. 
 I'm out of here. 
 What?! 
 I'm a respected lawyer and business manager, and I do not appreciate being victimised. 
 If you want to help us, you can tell us how to find your client, Daniel Lorca. 
 You must be aware that I can't talk about any of my clients. 
 Then I'm afraid we can't help you. 
 I'm sorry. 
 You're going to be more than sorry, Ms Davies. 
 I have already been granted a judicial review, which was just the first step. 
 I will be seeking massive damages against the SFO. 
 On what grounds? 
 You took files and documents that were completely unrelated to Daniel Lorca. 
 Your warrant is clearly in breach of legal professional privilege. 
 You took personal items, which is tantamount to theft. 
 Personal items? 
 Yeah. 
 Private photograph albums, a DVD, letters that have nothing to do with my business affairs. 
 Everything will be treated with the utmost confidentiality and returned to you in due course. 
 You don't get it, do you? 
 You picked a fight which you are going to lose. 
 I give you 24 hours to return everything you've taken. 
 Or else? 
 You're looking for Mr Lorca? 
 I'm a friend of his. 
 Mr Lorca doesn't have any friends. 
 Get off me! 
 Who are you? 
 No-one! 
 Agh! OK. 
 OK, I am with the SF0, the Serious Fraud Office, all right? 
 I don't believe you. 
 I haven't got my ID on me. I haven't got my clothes. 
 Turn him over. 
 I'm going to cut off what's under that towel. 
 If you still say you're SFO, then I'll believe you. 
 Stefan, come on! 
 This way. 
 Chill, chill, chill. 
 Yeah. 
 Oh, boy. 
 OK. 
 So? 
 Aren't you going to thank me? 
 I was there for you, I saved you. 
 OK, thanks. 
 I would have got out anyway. I had a move. 
 You'd have got away without your balls, mate. 
 At least we found something out. 
 What? 
 Well, someone doesn't want us to find Daniel Lorca. 
 I think we knew that anyway. 
 Can I have some help, please? I have a cardiac arrest. 
 Nurse, straight on the chest. Can I have 150 joules charged? 
 Charging to 150. 
 Shocking. Shocking now. 
 He's not responding. 
 One, two, three... 
 Shocking now. 
 One, two, three... 
 He's still not responding. 
 Abort resuscitation. We've lost him. 
 Welcome to England, Mr Kumalah. 
 Thank you. 
 Take me to the hotel. 
 Kumalah arrived in London a few minutes ago. 
 Do we know where he's staying? 
 He has got a suite at the Royal Claremont hotel, Mayfair. 
 £900 a night. 
 Not bad for someone coming from a country that receives 800 million a year in aid. 
 Right. 
 Go to the hotel and keep an eye on him. 
 I want to know everyone he meets. 
 Come out, I want to see you. 
 One minute. 
 It's been too long already. 
 Come back to bed. 
 Call room service. 
 What do you want? 
 Champagne. 
 I can't believe you're back. 
 You have no idea how I've been counting the hours. 
 Come home with me, Lisa. 
 It's all going to happen, everything we talked about. 
 You should be there. 
 Changing the world. 
 'My world. Yes, my country. 
 'What you're doing, what you have done, it's amazing.' 
 'We did it together, David.' 
 Which is why we should BE together. 
 Cardiac arrest, 12.07am. 
 Yes. 
 There will have to be an inquiry, the police are involved. 
 I did absolutely nothing wrong, Harriet. 
 Michael Freeland had been out of surgery 24 hours. 
 No complications, he was in full recovery. 
 You prescribed potassium chloride? 
 Yes, 10ml per hour over five hours. 
 That's not what this setting shows. 
 It's wrong. 
 This is set to inject 100ml per hour. 
 Where do these go? 
 Oh, they're for your brother. Put them in the fridge. 
 You know what he's like with his supplements and power drinks. 
 Would you miss him? If he moved out? 
 Why do you ask? 
 Of course I would. 
 But he will have to, one day. You too. 
 Are you seeing anyone? 
 Mum... 
 I'm allowed to ask. 
 And I'm allowed to not answer. 
 It's just, I met this young man in court. 
 Oh, great. He's a criminal? 
 No, you works for the Immigration Department. But I liked him. 
 YOU marry him, then. 
 Maybe you should start thinking about that. 
 No, I'm thinking about you. 
 I'm fine. 
 Yes? 
 Why, what's happened? 
 I'm afraid I have bad news for you, Leila. 
 One of your patients, Michael Freeland, died last night. 
 How? 
 What happened? 
 It seems a mistake was made with the dosage of potassium chloride that Dr Benson prescribed. 
 10ml per hour over five hours. 
 I gave him the right dose. 
 We don't believe so. 
 I'm telling you I did. 
 Have you checked the machine? 
 It'll be thoroughly examined, of course. 
 It was serviced two weeks ago. 
 There was nothing wrong with it then. 
 You're blaming me. 
 I wasn't there. 
 I'm sorry. 
 There will be a full inquiry, Leila. 
 But you should perhaps consider taking legal advice, and talk to your union rep. 
 Yeah. 
 You want to know who killed Michael Freeland? 
 I can help you. 
 Everything is in place. I just have to press the button. 
 Police, SFO. Why are you working together?
