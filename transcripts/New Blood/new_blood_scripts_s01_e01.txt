 (Faint shouting) 
 (Hubbub) Want some, buddy? Cheers. This way, please. The doctor will be with you soon to explain the procedure. Hi, I'm Mark. This is Laura. Hi, I'm Bruce. Are you nervous? A little. It's OK. It's fine. I studied medicine at uni. They do these things all the time. I asked when I got here. This drug we're testing is actually made by a UK company. I wouldn't be surprised if British doctors were overseeing things. How do? Am I the last one in? Looks like it. I couldn't find the place. You haven't done this before? You've got to be kidding! I wouldn't be here if I hadn't spent all my cash. I'm skint. We get dinner, breakfast and £600. That's my ticket home. Where's home? Leeds. Can't you tell? Huh! I'm still not sure. Most of us won't even get the real stuff, whatever it is. They just give you an injection and then you lie down for a few hours. How do you know? I've done it loads of times. Don't tell them, though. What if it's dangerous? It's not dangerous. They wouldn't be allowed to do it if it was. You'll be fine. I'm Henry. Some of you may feel a little drowsy. That's nothing to worry about. If you drift off to sleep, that's fine. Wake me up when it's all over, will you? When do we get out of here? Lunchtime tomorrow morning. Is lunch included? If you want anything, you can just ring the bell. Any other questions? Yeah. When do we get paid? 'How long have you been travelling? Two weeks.' (Knock at door) Enter! So, are we all set? Yes, Dr Leese. Excellent. Then carry on. (Music plays through headphones) Did you see that? What? One of them just left. Come on, we must find him before Dr Leese gets back. (Music plays through headphones) (Music blares) (She gasps) Doctor! Have you seen one of the patients from Green Fern? No, sir. I was just about to go home. OK. (Blade penetrates flesh) (Doctor whimpers) Please, no! ♪ I don't want to drown no more ♪ 
♪ I'm sick of the same old people ♪ 
♪ The kind that'll sell your soul ♪ 
♪ Trade it for a shining stone ♪ 
♪ Ain't nothing in this life for free ♪

♪ Won't you keep the wolves from the door? ♪ 
♪ It won't be long before I cave in and open up the door. ♪ (Thunderclap) (Faint siren wails) Ah! Horrible weather! I know, I've been standing in it for the last half-hour. Oh, I'm sorry. Here you are. What's this? It's an After Eight. I was just having dinner. Very nice. What we got, then? Suicide, by the look of it. 15 floors. Name? Flaxton Court. No, the body, not the building. Oh, er...Mark Henson. I got his wallet. Also, an electronic door pass from a secondary school. Must have been a teacher. Could've been a cook. Mustn't jump to conclusions. What, like he did? Yeah, well, er... check this place out and then send uniform round to next of kin. PHONE RINGS Heywood. Er...excuse me, sir. Who are you and what do you want? Er...Sayyad, sir. Is that a greeting, or is that your name? PC Sayyad. PC Sayyad. That's right. Are you the first attending officer? Er...no, sir. So, why are you talking to me, then? I don't think he jumped, sir. Oh, you've got some other theory about how he ended up splattered across the pavement, have you? He was pushed. No! Please!  (He screams) What makes you think that? I was second on the scene and I took his pulse. Had one, did he? No, sir. He was dead by the time I got here. But there was something on his skin. Some sort of adhesive. What are you talking about? I mean, it was like there had been adhesive tape around his wrists. Like he was tied up? So, where is this tape? Well, I don't know, I... So, you examined the body, you found traces of something on the wrists, so, why have you left him there?! Why haven't the hands been bagged?! Well, I... Call to Forensics, all right?! Do it now! What was that all about? Some bloody amateur. I need you to bag the hands. We'll bag them straightaway. Adhesive tape? Could've been anything. Let's check the roof. (He sighs) (He pants) You all right, Derek? You'd think they'd have a lift that worked. You didn't come up here, then. I did come here, I didn't see anything. Maybe you didn't look. Someone comes to his flat, ties up his hands, takes him up top. Why, Guv? What's the point? He's nobody. Well, someone thought he was worth killing. That PC you were talking to, what was he called? (Sirens wail) ♪ Light 'em up ♪ 
♪ We running London town ♪ 
♪ We'll raise the underground ♪ 
♪ We'll hit the ground ♪ 
♪ We're gonna burn the place down ♪ 
♪ Turn it up loud ♪ 
♪ You ain't messing with a rascal... ♪ Read the sign, innit? Look. (translated from Polish) : What? Look, you can't leave the bike here, man. You're late. And the Leech wants to see you. (Polish accent) : When? Half an hour ago. (Knock on door) Enter! You were wanting to see me, Mr Leese. Yes. Come in, Stefan. Close the door. Stefan Kowolski - is that right? Yes. You haven't been here long. Two weeks. You're temporary. From the agency? Yes. Agency sent me here. How long have you been in this country? I, erm, came here two year ago. From Poland. Yes, sir. And you're interested in a career in the NHS? In, erm, clinical pharmacy. Well, there's always openings for bright, young people and you're doing very well. You might want to take a look at your English, though. Sir? You typed up this report to the North London Cancer Network Board? Yes. There were quite a few errors. I, erm... I don't see. Third line. Cytotoxins. That's "cyto" with a C, not an S. Ah, yes. There's a couple more. Top of that paragraph. There's only one S in "aseptic". And there should be two T's in Dr Bennett. I'm, erm, sorry. If you want a full-time job, you'll have to try a little harder. If you're prescribing drugs, the smallest mistake can have serious consequences. Yes, sir. Of course, there's not many permanent contracts around at the moment. It won't be easy, but I might be able to help you, as a friend. Mr Leese... I'd like to get to know you a bit better, Stefan. I think we can help each other... No! Is not right. I'm sorry? I'm sorry, Mr Leese. I'm not like that. I don't know what you mean. What you do with your hand. I don't know what you're talking about. This isn't good enough. Do it again. Now get out. (English accent) : 'I'm not going back.' I didn't join the Serious Fraud Office to be a typist, Marcus. You ARE going back. Why? Because we've actually got someone inside. That's you. Leese has accepted you. And you're close to him. Too bloody close! Marcus, I've got that intel you wanted. Capitax Enterprises. Thank you, Alison. You want to get Leese? You want to bring him down? Yeah. Then don't say a word to Eleanor about what happened. OK? And thanks, Stefan. We owe you one. Man : 'Tell me something, Arrash. Why did you want to be a policeman?' I don't want to be a policeman. I want to be a detective. OK. Why do you want to be a detective? It's what I've always wanted. You did the detective course at Hendon. Top of the class. Commendations all round. From there, you went straight to Bromley for three months. That didn't work out too well. Ah, it was all right. They didn't want you. They sent you back here. Yeah, but it was a three-month fill in, maternity leave. That's right. She went off and had a little baby detective. But then she didn't go back to work. They got someone else in. I, erm... didn't know that. I'm telling you now. Thank you. I'm trying to help you, Arrash, although you probably don't see it that way. There's a difference between smart and smartarse. From what I hear from Bromley, they couldn't wait to see the back of you. If you're a TDC, you cannot step on people's toes. How many interviews have you had? Four. That should tell you something. Listen... you're clever. You're good at the job. We both know that. So, what are you doing wrong? Well, it seems that you conducted yourself pretty well last night. The murder at Flaxton Court. They're saying it's a murder now. I've had a request in from a DI Heywood - offer of six months probationary. Starting when? They want to see you first thing Monday morning. That soon enough for you? (He clears his throat) Thank you, Sergeant. Arrash, don't screw it up. OK. This is going very well, isn't it? The Serious Fraud Office supplying the NHS with free secretarial assistance. But to be honest with you, I've yet to be convinced that this man, David Leese, is our best way into UK Remicon. And let's not forget they're the ones we're after. David Leese is a chief pharmacist for six London hospitals with a combined budget of almost 150 million a year, and yet he's managing to spend almost a third of it with the same company. All with UK Remicon, at prices way above the generic brands. He's taking backhanders. Well, he must be. Isn't it obvious? UK Remicon are bribing him to choose their products for the NHS. They're making millions. Shame we haven't got a shred of evidence. You've issued a Section 2 on his accounts? He has three bank accounts. Uh-huh. Nothing. And his lifestyle? He drives a Porsche. He eats in the best restaurants. He has a second home in the country. He can afford to. He's earning 95,000 a year. And he has a wife who also earns. He's married? You sound surprised why? Cos... What? Because he's a b*st*rd. Eleanor, um... Can we have a word alone? ..Do you mind? Has something happened that I should know about? No. Meaning it hasn't happened or I shouldn't know about it? OK. Let's talk about UK Remicon. A British company with a market capitalisation of 50 billion. They employ 37,000 people in England, Ireland and Scotland. They're criminals. They're protected. As you'd expect, they have some very powerful friends, in business and in government. Right now, I have three teams, 30 people, working on this. We've scanned over 10,000 documents, spent God knows how many man-hours, and you think I'm going to risk it all for your Batman and Robin antics? My Batman and Robin antics are why you employed me. You go after UK Remicon down the usual channels, you're going to get nowhere. Even if you get them to court, UK Remicon is too big, too smart. But Dr David Leese isn't. He's our way in. Two more weeks. Right. You need to take a look at his private correspondence. Contacts. Find something, anything, that links Dr Leese to UK Remicon. But how would I do that? How do I get back into his office? You'll find a way. Oh, and, Stefan, be careful. (on laptop) : So tell me, Henry, how was your day? Boring. At the car wash? Yeah. What's it called again? Squeegees. That is a stupid name for a car wash. I want to see you. I know. I drove all that way and you weren't even there. If you start that again, I'm going to sign off. Don't! Don't... We'll be together soon. I wish I was with you now. And what would you do? If you were here, right now? I don't know. I bet I can guess. Anyway, I might be coming to London. When? Quite soon. Will I see you? It depends. Are you still on that stuff? What? The medicine. Are you still taking it? No. You shouldn't, Henry. It does things to you. You shouldn't trust it. Henry? Henry, are you still there? Henry? Are you there? I have to go. I heard. I'll call you later. I know you will. I love you, Henry. I really do. Hello, love. You have a good day? Yeah. It was all right. Who was that you were talking to just now? There was no-one. Right. I'll make supper. By the way, I've just noticed the car. What about it? It's got a big dent in it. What? On the front bonnet. Are you saying I did it? I just wondered... You think I'd have bashed the car and I wouldn't have told you? No. I only just noticed it myself and I was wondering how it happened. That's all. I'd have noticed if I'd hit something. It's just that... Why do you have to make such a big deal out of it? (She sighs) You're right. I'll make supper. Stefan : 'Alison...?' Can you get this for me? I need a Section 2. Who's Elizabeth Leese? Erm, David Leese works for the City of London Health Trust. She's his wife. And you think he might be running something through her accounts? I'm looking for any connection to UK Remicon. I'll get on to them. Great. Stefan... What? I haven't seen you around much the last two weeks. What have you been doing? Working for Marcus. Why do you want to know? I just wondered. Do you fancy dinner next week? Tuesday. My brother and his girlfriend are coming round. Tuesday? Yeah. Yeah. All right. Great. (Raised voices) (Football on TV) (Chatter in Polish) Oh... What are you doing? Kamil, shut the door! (Kamil chuckles) (Chatter continues) (He speaks in Polish) English, Jan. Remember? We speak in English. The landlord call. He want to, erm, put up rent. What did you tell him? (He replies in Polish) (They chuckle) I tell him, erm, call back, speak to you. Toilet broken. (Train trundles, glasses clatter) (shouting over train) (They cheer at football) (Women chatter) 
 
 Who's here? Aunt Darya, Aunt Minoo and two people from Mum's work. Why? It's her birthday. Whose? I don't know. One of them. Arrash! There you are! Come in. Your aunts are here. Aunt Darya. Aunt Minoo. And this is Mrs Clayton who works in my office. Your mother's told me so much about you, Arrash. Dinner's nearly ready. Are you going to get changed? Oh, Mum, I've got to do my bike. Now? I've got the race tomorrow. Gerald used to like bicycling, didn't you, Gerald. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah... All right. Ten minutes. I'll get you a beer. Stefan : 'Mr Menakis,' you can't do this! We have a fixed-term agreement which runs for another three months! 'I told you the rent would rise.' No. No. You never said that. Anyway, you have to give us notice. That's the law! 'Don't tell me about the law. I know the law.' We're already paying you enough. We can't afford any more. (Men shout nearby) Here. Thanks. I got some news today. Oh, yeah, what's that? I'm moving to CID. What? You've got another placement? Six months as a TDC. That's brilliant, Rash. That's really great. I can't believe you're sitting out here by yourself. (He chuckles) This time... I just want to get it right. Come on, dinner will be ready. (Music drowns speech) (Music drowns speech) (Distant laughter) (Inaudible) (Crashing, glass smashes) (Dog barks) (Man shouts in Polish) (Man yells in Polish) PA : 'All competitors, all competitors, the 25 to 35 year category race will begin in five minutes. This is your five-minute warning.' Hey, Rash. Hey. (They exchange greetings) Just one moment. Hi. Hi. I haven't seen you at one of these before. I haven't been to one before. So, are you just supporting someone? Or are you here to have fun? She's with me. Just here for fun, then.  (She chuckles) Who are you? I'm her brother. Brother and sister? That's nice. I'll, er, see you later. Yeah, if you can keep up. I was talking to her. Just chatting up the opposition? I wasn't chatting him up. He was chatting me up. Good luck. (Chattering) Come on, boys! Starter : 'On your marks! Get set!' (Gun fires) (Cheering) Come on, Rash! (Cheering) Come on, Rash! See ya! (Cheering) Come on, Rash! Come on! Come on, Rash! (Cheering and applause) (Chatter) You were brilliant, Rash! Thanks. Hold this. Congratulations. What do you mean? You came third. I came second. YOU came third. We'll see. And I'd have come first if you hadn't got in my way. I didn't get in your way. You swerved in front of me! Well, if I was in front of you, I must have come second. (He scoffs) You know what? It doesn't matter. It doesn't make a difference. Are you going to be at East London? The triathlon? Yeah. I'll see you there. Yeah, you'll see my back! Arrash Sayyad. Where does that name come from? Ah, I was born here. Um, my parents came from Tehran. Your dad a policeman? Um, he was. Bromley didn't like you very much, did they? I didn't like them very much either. What, you think you can pick and choose? I didn't ask to leave. No. No, I can see that. You'll be working with DS Sands, standing in for DC Westfield. He's on sick leave. Ah, thank you, Guv. I'm grateful. Yeah, well, don't be. Some little b*st*rd stuck a knife in him, and if you want the truth, I'd rather Jack was standing here than you. That was good work the other night. The sticky tape. I'm not saying we wouldn't have got there in the end, but you were quick off the mark. I like that. So, I want you to work on the Henson investigation. You got a problem with that, Derek? No, Guv. Not at all. That's going to be your spot there. Right. Witness statements. House-to-house. CCTV. Pathology report. Henson's medical records. Go through them all. I'm sorry about DC Westfield. What do you know? 'I've got good news.' What's that? 'I'm coming to London.' When? 'This evening.' Can I see you? 'Of course you can. Why do you think I'm telling you?' Where will you be? 'Can you meet me off the train?' When? '6.30.' I can't. I'm working. 'It's a car wash, Henry. They won't miss you. They don't even know you're there.' Of course you can. 'Which station?' Canary Wharf. Come down to the platform. East-bound. Remember. 6.30. 'Why?' Because it's romantic, Henry. You can get a bus to the station, come down the escalator and meet me on the platform. 'All right.' And don't tell anyone! It's just you and me. Hm? I've got to go. Bye. (Bullets click) Sweet little Henry. (Magazine clacks) He'll be there. (Big Ben chimes the hour) The Serious Fraud Office is bad for business and that's bad for government. Which is why I'm here. Have you got any news for me? Have you heard from them yet? The SFO? Nothing. I assume they're trawling through our banking records. Hmm, company AND individual. How are things at UK Remicon, William? I want them off our back. The trouble with The Serious Fraud Office is that once they get started, they don't stop. Gemma, I'm off to Southwark, I probably won't be back today. So, can you leave that stuff on my desk? Yes, Mr Leese. 'I have a source within the SFO and I hear they've moved into a new phase. They may have gone undercover. It's going to make it harder to protect you.' You're in government. Can't you stop them? They're a completely independent organisation, William. They report to the Attorney General. They do not work for him. You know that. Even so... Well, if they do something stupid. 'If they step out of line, we may be able to step in. What exactly are they looking for? Financial fraud, business malpractice, bribing or coercing of doctors or NHS officials.' Nothing, I'm sure, that would concern anyone at UK Remicon. Of course not. Unless, of course, there was something you weren't telling me. (He rattles handle) Stefan? What do you want? (in Polish accent) : I, um... I leave this for Mr Leese. He's gone for the day. I'll take it. (in Polish accent) : Oh. Thank you... Gemma. Where are we going? Flaxton Court? That's right. I... just wondered. Do you mind if we keep the chit-chat down to a minimum? I'll be honest with you. The last thing I need right now is a Trainee Detective Constable, especially one who thinks he knows everything. Nothing personal. It sounds pretty personal to me... You might be right. I spoke to Bromley. I know all about you. And if I want conversation, I've got the radio. Er, have forensics been in? No, they haven't. I mean, why would they need fingerprints or luminol or a complete bleeding crime report? Of course they've been in! (Pillock.) Er, what are we looking for? We're looking for the reason he was killed. Mark Henson. Teaches French and German at a local secondary. No girlfriend. No boyfriend. Nice little flat. Big mortgage, though. Must be getting some help from Mum and Dad. What are you doing? Er, just taking a photo. What, as a souvenir? Just leave it! Maybe we should talk to someone at his school. (sarcastically) : Do you think so? Really? Ah, why didn't I think of that? Come on! (School bell rings) Mark had been here for two years. We were completely shocked. This is his classroom? Yes. I'm going to need to see his locker. The quiet room. Any personal possessions. Of course. Had he...? Had he been behaving strangely in any way or, um... had anything upset him? I wasn't aware of anything untoward. He'd just agreed to direct Bugsy Malone. I did Bugsy! Oh, what part were you? Dandy Dan. Excuse me? I don't think he was killed because of a school play. (Knock at door) Laura! Come in. This is Laura Jones, she works in our maths department. She knew Mark best. This is Detective Sergeant Sands and... How did you know Mark Henson? Er, we did teacher training together. After that, we spent the summer travelling. Where were you? What? When you went travelling? We were in India. When was this? Six years ago. But we kept in touch. We stayed friends. So, what can you tell us about him? Was he worried about anything? Or did he have anything on his mind? Three weeks ago, he got quite upset. We both were. Why? Someone we knew got killed in an accident. He was a friend. Who was he? His name was Steve Mullen. (voice breaking) : I can't believe it, both of them... You don't have to say any more if you prefer not to. Yes. She does, actually. What happened to Steve Mullen? A car accident. A hit-and-run. (Lock clicks) Woman : Henry, I want to talk to you. Mr Robinson called me from the car wash. What happened? (Distorted flashes) (Inaudible speech) (Interference buzzes) (Distorted sound) (Glass cracks) I didn't like working there. You could have talked to me! You don't listen. That's not true! I got you that job. I know it's not much, washing cars, but if you don't work, you're not going to have control over your life. It's not just about the money! It's important! Why haven't you been taking your medication? You've been in my room?! I'm trying to look after you. It's all I ever do! Why have you stopped? It doesn't help me. All these big pharma companies, they want to control me. They just make things worse. Who said that? That's not you talking. Who's been telling you that? No-one. It's that computer of yours. You spend hours upstairs in your room. You're talking to someone. Why don't you leave me alone? I didn't like the job. I left. I can get another one. (Keys clack) (Ringing tone) 'Henry, I'll see you very soon. Canary Wharf. On the platform. Remember.' A bit of a coincidence. What? That Mark Henson's pushed off a roof and just three weeks before, someone he knew, someone he was close to, is killed in a hit-and-run. Get onto traffic command. I want all the details about Mullen's death. Witness statements, CCTV, the usual. All right. And in the meantime, keep your opinions to yourself. All right, Dandy Dan? (Chattering) (Drills whir, hammering nearby) (Men talk nearby) (Drilling, men speak in Polish) (in Polish) Here's the Luton collision report you asked for. Thanks. (Camera clicks) (Lift pings) I'm sorry. I'm going to be late tonight... Paperwork, yeah. I'll be as quick as I can. (Camera clicks) Laura : 'I can't believe it,' both of them... (Keys jangle, lock clicks) (Wood groans) (Loud thud) (Drilling and sawing close by) (Workmen chatter in Polish) (Workmen laugh) Oh, sh... Oh! Er, Mrs Philips? I will deal with this in the morning. I just need to have another word with Laura. She has left. You just missed her. Where does she live? Well, I... It's really important, Mrs Philips. Two people are dead. Do you think she could be in danger? I just need to speak to her. Well, she has a flat in South London. Here. Is this her mobile? Yes. You might be lucky, you might just catch her. (Keypad tones) Thank you. Yes, Mum. I'm just at the station. I'll call round later. All right? Voicemail : '..currently unavailable...' Voicemail. She gets the DLR to Canary Wharf. It's just two minutes up the road. PA : 'Move away from the edge of Platform 2. This train is ready to leave. The next train will leave in two minutes.' (He sighs) (Distorted sound) (Distant screams) (Screaming) Laura? Laura! Laura? Laura! Laura! Laura? Laura? Laura! Has anyone called an ambulance? I'm Arrash Sayyad. Stefan Kowolski. I work for the Serious Fraud Office. Name? David Leese. It can't have been an accident. She was killed. She was murdered. You used them in some sort of medical experiment. That's what connects them. There are two other people in this photograph. Find out who they are. (He gasps) (Yes!)
