 Sammy, do you realize that you and I have been going out a month, and this is the first time we've been alone together? 
 I know. With me living at my folks' house.. 
 Yeah, me living at Pee‐Wee's playhouse. 
 Yeah, sure hope we didn't ruin your weekend, Jess. 
 Oh, no, why would you think that? 
 Just because I've been waiting a month to be with Sam. 
 I used to be this free‐wheeling living on the edge.. 
 ...no strings kinda guy and now.. 
 Now, it seems like I'm‐I'm married or something. 
 I don't know what the hell's happened to my life, pal but I gotta regain control of it. 
 "I don't think it's working out for me here. 
 "I'll call soon." 
 Jesse ran away from home? 
 [instrumental music] 
 Jesse ran away from home? 
 I'm hungry. 
 Where's Uncle Jesse? 
 Uh, girls, if you'll excuse us for a brief moment. 
 Um, I have to talk to Joey privately about.. 
 About this note, that, uh, I wrote myself reminding me to talk to Joey privately. 
 About this note that I wrote. 
 What are we going to say to the girls? 
 Joey.. 
 ...this is a delicate situation. 
 It's a father kind of moment. 
 You better let me handle it. 
 What do you want me to do? 
 Just play dumb. 
 How do I do that? 
 Perfect. 
 Oh, hi. You're back. 
 Did Uncle Jesse go somewhere? 
 Girls, your father has something to say. 
 Your Uncle Jesse has gone on a little.. 
 ...vacation. 
 Where? 
 Where? 
 You saw him last. 
 Tell them, Joey. 
 Okay...father. 
 Uh, girls.. 
 ...your Uncle Jesse went on vacation.. 
 ...to the desert. 
 'And why, you ask?' 
 Um, because he loves the‐the hot sand. 
 And he loves the burning sun. 
 Bottom line, your Uncle Jesse loves to sweat. 
 I thought he loved going to the beach. 
 Well.. 
 ...the desert is all beach. 
 Okay. Here we go. 
 Your favorite strawberry yogurt banana pancakes just like your Uncle Jesse makes. 
 These aren't just like Uncle Jesse makes. 
 His aren't soupy in the middle. 
 Mine aren't soupy. 
 Here, Michelle. 
 You'll appreciate my cooking. 
 That a girl. 
 Go, ahead, taste it, honey. 
 Everybody's a critic. 
 [telephone rings] 
 I got it. 
 Gladstone's International House of Flapjacks. 
 Gladstone speaking. 
 ‐ Jesse! Hey, how's it going? ‐ Uncle Jesse! 
 ‐ I want to talk to him. ‐ Wait let me talk. 
 ‐ Hi, Jesse. It's D. J. ‐ Hey, I want to talk to him. 
 ‐ Give it, let me talk to him. ‐ I want to talk to him! 
 I'll talk to anyone you want. 
 ‐ Just make a decision. ‐ Come on, please? 
 How the heck is the desert, Jess? 
 What desert? I'm skiing in Tahoe. 
 Look, I'm hanging out with my buddies and, uh I don't know when I'm coming back. 
 So, in case of an emergency I want to give you the number it's, uh, "5‐5‐5 
 "4‐3‐2‐2." 
 I got to tell Uncle Jesse something. 
 I got to tell Uncle Jesse something! 
 Okay, here. 
 Oh, no. I forgot what I was going to tell him. 
 Oh, I remember. Silly me. 
 Hi, Uncle Jesse. 
 While you're on vacation can I sleep in your room? 
 Which was my room before it was your room? 
 Thanks, Uncle Jesse. 
 Everybody say bye. 
 (all) Bye. 
 Bye‐bye. Goodbye. 
 Say bye‐bye, Michelle.

 ‐ Whoo! ‐ Awoo! 
 What do you say? 
 Let's drink a toast to the return of our man Jesse. 
 Thank you, thank you, thank you. 
 And...a toast to my escape from romper room. 
 No, no. To you paying for the cabin. 
 Listen up. Fellas, this is only the beginning. 
 Man, when I get back to town I'm going to get my own place and start living life the way I was born to live. 
 ‐ Yeah! ‐ Alright. 
 Fellas, let's hit the slopes! 
 ‐ Awoo! ‐ He we go! 
 We're going skiing. Yeah! Alright. 
 I'll just put on my ski pants here. 
 Yeah, my little ski pants. 
 Lookin' good. 
 Whoop! Okay. 
 Yes, it's winter wonderland time, folks. 
 Winter wonderland. 
 I am psyched! 
 Just put on my scarf, 'cause it's about eight degrees outside. 
 And of course, jacket. 
 Always remember it's better to look good than to ski good. 
 Put on the gloves the water‐proof gloves. 
 And, of course, the cap which is very important. 
 We get the goggles on. 
 Hey, man. Alright! 
 Fanny pack. You mustn't forget the old fanny pack. 
 Gotta keep the fanny warm. 
 And the skis.. 
 ...and the poles.. 
 ...and.. 
 [panting] God, I'm tired. 
 Will someone just break my leg now and stick me in front of the fire? 
 Dad, I always get my guitar lesson from Uncle Jesse. 
 Are you sure you want to do this? 
 Honey, this is gonna be a lot of fun. 
 I'm going to teach you a great song. Come here. 
 Okay, now, you watch what I do real carefully and then you do it. 
 ♪ Froggie went a‐courtin' and he did ride uh‐huh ♪ 
 ♪ Froggie went a‐courtin' and he did ride uh‐huh ♪ 
 ♪ Well froggie went a‐‐ ♪ Dad! Dad, stop. 
 Here's where I am. 
 Maybe froggie's not quite ready to go a‐courtin' yet. 
 Let's work on that "D" chord. Come on. 
 Sit right down here. 
 Now take these two fingers and put them on the second fret. 
 No, the second fret. 
 No, the second fret. 
 No, the second fret. 
 ‐ No, the second‐‐ ‐ Dad. 
 You're making me nervous. 
 How can I make you nervous? 
 I'm your father. 
 Because whenever you try to teach me things, we argue. 
 ‐ No, we don't. ‐ Yes, we do. 
 No, we don't. 
 ‐ Yes, we do. ‐ No, we don't! 
 What am I doing? 
 You're arguing with me. 
 I'm not arguing with you. 
 You're arguing with me. 
 Now, we're here to have fun. 
 Well, I'm not having fun. 
 I'd have fun if Uncle Jesse was here. 
 That's what this is all about, isn't it? 
 All of Uncle Jesse's clothes are gone. 
 Is Uncle Jesse thinking about moving out? 
 The truth? 
 Yes. 
 I hate this. 
 When mom died, I never thought I'd like living in this house again. 
 Then Uncle Jesse and Joey moved in and things got better. 
 I don't want anything to change. 
 Aw, honey. 
 I want him to stay as much as you do. 
 Then why don't you get him back? 
 Because he's an adult. 
 You can't just go pick him up and put him under your arm and bring him back home. 
 Right now he's struggling with some things. 
 When.. 
 ...and if the time is right.. 
 ...he'll be back. 
 Okay? 
 Well, it's not okay. 
 But okay. 
 Come on. Let's finish the guitar lesson. 
 What else did Uncle Jesse do? 
 Well, he usually teaches me an Elvis song. 
 I know a great one.

 ♪ Do you miss me tonight ♪

 Thanks for helping me move in, Michelle. 
 Why don't you just put that stuff right over there? 
 'Thank you.' 
 You know, Michelle, I grew up in this room. 
 Boy, this place brings back memories. 
 Here, Steph, you forgot the rest of your zoo. 
 Thanks, D. J., Isn't it neat we each have our own room for a couple of days? 
 Might be more than a couple of days. 
 What are you talking about? 
 Oh, nothing. 
 What is going on? 
 Uh, Steph.. 
 Who do you think's a better singer? 
 Alvin or Theodore? 
 Are you serious? 
 Everybody knows without Alvin they're just a bunch of squirrels dressed like Don Johnson. 
 You're right. 
 See you. 
 Freeze. 
 What is going on? 
 Alright, Steph. 
 Sit down. 
 You should hear this, too, Michelle. 
 Uncle Jesse didn't just go on a vacation. 
 He's thinking about moving out. 
 Can't daddy get him back? 
 Dad said there's nothing he can do. 
 Then we got to do something. 
 You're right, Steph. 
 What if Uncle Jesse never comes back? 
 Daddy. 
 Okay. Here's the plan. 
 ‐ I'll call Uncle Jesse. ‐ Check. 
 Then I'll tell him Michelle's really sick. 
 And he'll come rushing back. 
 Then what? 
 Well, then you throw your arms around him and beg him to stay while I let the air out of his tires. 
 Wow! 
 Uh, I need to speak to Jesse Cochran. 
 This is his niece D. J. Tanner. 
 Jesse's still out skiing. 
 Uh, could you hold the line for one brief moment? 
 He's not there. What are we gonna do we do? 
 I don't know! Let me think. 
 Okay! I got it! 
 This is Stephanie Tanner, Uncle Jesse's other niece. 
 Now listen very carefully. 
 Help! 
 Tell Uncle Jesse the baby's sick and she's coughing real bad. 
 Here, listen. 
 ‐ Cough! Cough! ‐ Cough! 
 [coughing] 
 Ahh. 
 Ahh. 
 [coughing] 
 See? The baby's coughing really loud. 
 Now Uncle Jesse's the only one who can get her to take her cough medicine. 
 Promise me you'll tell him. Thanks. 
 I lied. I hate to lie. 
 But it was for a good cause. 
 I guess. 
 But if you could cough a few times I'd feel a lot better about this whole dirty business. 
 [cough] 
 Thank you.

 Cough, I think. 
 Oh.

 I got to call home. 
 Jesse, what's wrong? 
 The kid is sick. 
 I'm her uncle. She looks exactly like me. 
 Damn, it's busy. 
 I'm sorry guys, but see, I'm the only one who can give her her cough medicine. 
 And‐and I'm the best at singing her to sleep. 
 Sorry, fellas. I got to split. 
 ‐ Oh. ‐ Come on. 
 Michelle needs me. 
 Oh, I'm sorry, honey. 
 But you knew when we got involved there were other women in my life. 
 ‐ Hey...yes! ‐ Okay. 
 Okay. 
 Here's the shot. 
 I'm gonna jump over the couch spin around three times drive to the hoop double pump twice finishing off with a reverse tomahawk monster jam. 
 Is this before or after you spin straw into gold? 
 Oh, yeah? Watch this! 
 Yeah, I'd like to see Michael Jordan sink a shot like that with a couch on the court. 
 How is she? 
 ‐ Jesse! ‐ Hey, buddy. 
 Where's Michelle? 
 Do I need to give her her cough medicine? 
 What are you talking about? 
 What do you mean what am I talking about? 
 Somebody called and said Michelle was very very sick. 
 Michelle's fine. 
 She's fine? 
 [sighs] Thank God. 
 What do you mean, she's fine? 
 Do you realize I've been driving for four hours from lake Tahoe on my motorcycle in the freezing cold behind a cattle truck? 
 Well, I've got to tell you, you made excellent time. 
 Alright. 
 Which one of you called? 
 Must have been the girls. 
 I think you really shook 'em up the way you took off like you did. 
 No, I'm sorry. I didn't mean that. 
 But it was something I had to do. 
 Jesse, hang on. Talk to us. 
 Yeah, maybe we can help you. 
 Look, guys...ever since I've been out of high school I've done what I wanted, whenever I wanted with whoever I wanted. 
 I've had no one to answer to nobody to worry about but myself, me. 
 So I took off to find that guy. 
 And you know what? I found him. 
 I was having a great time, hanging with my buddies playing music. 
 Then I get this call. 
 Michelle is sick. Bam! Just like that. 
 I come running back right into Mr. Rogers' neighborhood. 
 I'm sorry, guys. 
 I don't think it's where I want to be. 
 Jesse, wait! 
 You're going about this all wrong. 
 I mean, maybe, when you moved in here you lost something. 
 ‐ Look how much you've gained. ‐ What, Joseph? 
 What have I gained? 
 I'll give you a perfect example. 
 Why do you think you came rushing back here to check on a cough? 
 Because I care about Michelle. 
 But I cared about Michelle before I moved into this house. 
 Yeah, but before you moved into this house the girls were just your nieces. 
 You stopped by four times a year to give them birthday and Christmas presents. 
 (Danny) 'It's not like that anymore, is it?' 
 You have any idea how important you are to those three girls? 
 Jesse, you have been there every time those girls have needed you. 
 Can you honestly tell me that you can just forget about the past seven months? 
 Just walk out of this house and.. 
 ...go back to visits on birthdays and Christmas? 
 They do love me, don't they? 
 They really love me, don't they? 
 Ha ha ha. 
 Well, fellas, can you blame them? 
 Feels pretty good, doesn't it? 
 I'm going to tell you guys something.. 
 ...but you better not tell any of my friends I said this. 
 I think I'm realizing that.. 
 ...being part of this family is.. 
 ...filling a...empty.. 
 ...an empty space in my heart.. 
 ...that I didn't even know was there. 
 Jesse, we can make this easier for you. 
 You can take time for yourself whenever you need it. 
 Yeah, don't wait till it builds up inside then you gotta run away from home again. 
 If you need to take off for a few days, fine. 
 We'll cover for you. 
 Yeah, we'll‐we'll make this work. 
 Will you stay out of my room? 
 I'll try. 
 So, Lassie's coming home? 
 Yeah, yeah, Lassie's coming home. 
 I got to hug somebody. 
 Me, too. 
 Go nuts. 
 Hey, watch it. 
 Sorry, kid. 
 Uncle Jesse! 
 You're back, you're back. 
 You're back, you're back. 
 You're back! 
 D.J., get in here, quick! 
 Uncle Jesse's back! 
 Our plan worked! 
 Uncle Jesse! You're back! 
 Hey! 
 Well, I was in the neighborhood, you know.. 
 Are you here to stay? 
 Or pick up your stuff and leave again? 
 Come here, girls. Sit down. 
 Come here, D. J. 
 I came back because I was worried about Michelle.. 
 ...and because I missed you two guys. 
 And no, I'm not going anywhere. 
 Does this mean you'll never leave again? 
 I can't promise you I'm gonna live here forever. 
 But what I can promise is.. 
 ...I'm always going to be your uncle. 
 And I'm always going to be there when you two need me. 
 And I'm always gonna love you two knuckleheads very, very much. 
 Cross your heart and hope to die? 
 Pinkie swear! 
 Oh! He does mean business! 
 You're up. 
 Here. 
 I drove four hours in the freezing cold on my motorcycle behind a cattle truck to give you this. 
 Here you go. 
 'Not impressed, are you?' 
 Michelle, can I talk to you a second? 
 You know, when I first came here I thought I was just gonna move in for a few months you know just to help out and then.. 
 ...get on with my life, but.. 
 ...you know what? 
 This is my life. 
 This is where I'm supposed to be right now. 
 Come here. 
 Do you realize, young lady, what you put me through tonight? 
 I was with the most incredible woman in the world. 
 Over two years old, that is. Sorry. 
 Anyway.. 
 ...from the moment I heard you were sick.. 
 ...all I could do was think of this face. 
 What is it about this face, huh? 
 [giggles] 
 Good answer. 
 Goodnight, kid. 
 'Da.' 
 Can I get a kiss? 
 You know something, you little munchkin? 
 I love you.
