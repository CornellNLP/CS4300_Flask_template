 Previously on "Bitten": 
 Ahh! 
 Where is he? 
 I know better than to go against the Pack. 
 Jeremy : What have you done with Malcolm? 
 He's going to be the thing that saves our girl, Savannah. 
 We need him to lure this demon who calls himself Aleister Vi. 
 Savannah was kidnapped by this force. 
 I had a strange dream last night. 
 There was a man in a barn... 
 He turns into a wolf. 
 I have been looking for you. 
 We've never done anything to you. 
 Yes, you have, Ruth. 
 More than you know right now. 
 Time to say goodbye. 
 Gah! 
 Goodbye. 
 The woman from Rochester, the one who I told you was screaming. 
 He said that she was in pain because of the baby. 
 That's Rachel. 
 Clayton : Where did they take her? 
 Where did they take Elena and Logan? 
 No, no, no! 
 Aleister : Malcolm wasn't the strongest after all. 
 (Suspenseful music) 
 Woman : (Distant and echoing) BP 160 over 120. 
 She's experiencing tachycardia. 
 Do we need beta blockers? 
 (Gagging) 
 (Heavy breathing) 
 (Gasping) 
 We're just examining you. 
 You're going to be okay. 
 What are you doing? 
 You're the one we've been waiting for. 
 The most powerful werewolf. 
 In your blood lies the answer. 
 Finally, we will achieve the Undoing. 
 No... No!

 Hello? 
 Savannah? 
 Is that you? I'm Elena, I'm... 
 (Door closing in distance) 
 (Electric pulsing, current buzzing) 
 Ugh! 
 (Electric pulsing) 
 Ahhh! 
 What about border crossings? 
 Keep me posted. Anything? 
 Four hours combing the area by the barn. 
 She could be anywhere by now. 
 What about the back roads? 
 Nothing. 
 Paige has made the connection. 
 If they're anywhere near Savannah, she'll know. 
 (Whispered) I still can't believe this is our best shot at finding them. 
 Their telepathy has been useful to us in the past. 
 Savannah, are you with us? 
 (Otherworldly whispers) 
 I am with you. 
 Are you okay? 
 Are you alone? 
 I thought you were coming to get me. 
 Where are you? 
 We're with the wolves. 
 I'm sorry, Savannah, things didn't go as planned. 
 I need the truth. 
 Has Aleister ever asked you about our powers? 
 He knows what we are. 
 It's not a big deal. 
 Listen to me very carefully, Savannah. 
 You can never trust Aleister. 
 You don't get it. He's... 
 He's dangerous! 
 He may act nicely towards you, but that is not who he really is. 
 And you can't tell him about our connection. 
 Do you understand? 
 I know! 
 Ask her if Elena's there. 
 Have you seen a woman? 
 She would have come in today. 
 There's a woman in the room beside me. 
 I think that she said that her name was Elena. 
 Did you see her? 
 Is he a wolf? 
 I'll explain later. Don't worry. 
 Why aren't you answering any of my questions? 
 Are you sure it's Elena? 
 I didn't see her face. 
 She kicked a hole through the wall. 
 Is she there now? 
 They just took her again. 
 They're doing tests on her. 
 Tests? Do they do tests on you? 
 Tell me what's going on. 
 Savannah, do they do tests on you? 
 No, I told you! 
 What tests are they doing on Elena? 
 He's... 
 (Metal door clanging) 
 I'm coming. 
 (Gasp, sigh) 
 (Breathing out) 
 The channel closed suddenly. 
 Somebody must have interrupted her. 
 What?... No, no. The connection is broken. 
 Paige needs to ground herself after communication. 
 Isn't there something we can do? 
 We're going to find Elena. 
 I promise. 
 (Effort grunts) 
 Good morning. 
 How did you sleep? 
 Like a baby... shot full of drugs. 
 You put up a great fight. 
 It took four guards to get you down. 
 Um, I'll give you something for the pain. 
 The best thing you can do right now is let me go. 
 Or you won't like what happens next. 
 So, that means you'll turn into a werewolf? 
 What the hell are you talking about? 
 It's okay, we know. 
 We are very pleased about this new development. 
 We had no idea there were female werewolves. 
 Why am I here? 
 We just want to understand you better. 
 You won't be harmed. 
 Why do I not believe you? 
 You are crucial to everything that's going to happen. 
 Please, you are the first lucid person that I've met here. 
 Just tell me why you want me. 
 You are the way through. 
 You will open the gate to the Undoing. 
 (Sigh) 
 Aren't you happy that you get to play such a big part? 
 Now, just a few more tests, and then maybe you can go out for a run. 
 Would you like that? 
 (High-pitched hum) 
 Oh, that's loud. 
 (Pitch increases until it is inaudible) 
 Elena : Ahhh! 
 (Gasping in pain) 
 Oh, that's interesting. 
 Even in your human form, you can still hear canine frequencies.

 That dream you had the other day about the wolf Malcolm, that was very helpful. He was at the barn, like you said. 
 So was your Coven. 
 Yeah? 
 Yes. They were there. 
 And they wanted to trade you. For Malcolm, like you were an object for barter. 
 So, what happened? Well, that's not what you want... to go back with them. They want to control you. 
 No. They're concerned about me. 
 Savannah, I am the lock. 
 I am the key. 
 They want to control you. 
 They don't let me do anything. 
 They treat me like a child. 
 Exactly. 
 I won't let them take you. 
 You're a big part of the work we're doing here, Savannah. 
 You deserve to know what's going on. 
 You have a new neighbour. A werewolf. 
 That's why we have to lock your door: for your safety. 
 It's for my safety. 
 But you have the intercom if you need anything. 
 There's nothing to worry about. 
 You are far too important to me. 
 (Fingers snap) So... what are we going to do today? Hm? 
 Something really cool? 
 You know I don't have my powers yet. 
 They're starting. Any day now, you'll feel them. 
 So, what would you like to learn? 
 You can do anything you want here. 
 Ah, you're mad at your Coven. 
 The way they try to control you. 
 Stop you from reaching your full potential. 
 They want to control me. 
 That glass, focus all of your feelings there. 
 Just... let them wash over you. 
 The frustration, the rage. 
 Ah, ah, ah, ah. 
 Left hand. 
 (Whispering) Okay. 
 Now, show them just how powerful you are. 
 (Scraping) 
 Wow! 
 That's never happened before. 
 You see? 
 What did I tell you? 
 You can do anything you want. 
 (Suspenseful music) 
 ♪ 
 ♪ 
 (Sigh) What? 
 Aleister : Savannah's coming into her powers. 
 I'm accelerating her sessions. 
 She's leaning towards me, I can feel it. 
 Why don't you just brand her like the others and bring her to the inside mind? 
 She needs to be able to direct her own powers on the chosen path. 
 We're almost there. How's this coming? 
 Not good. 
 A werewolf from Buffalo. 
 When we mix his blood with Savannah's, her macrophages engulf the foreign particles, the same response as with the dead wolf. 
 The wolf's blood should be attacking the witch's blood. 
 What about the female? What does her blood do? 
 She hasn't turned into a wolf yet. 
 I ran her through the auditory tests. 
 Fear and sensory stress caused the others to turn into werewolves. 
 Not her. 
 (Breathlessly) She's remarkable. 
 You're enjoying your work. 
 Oh, I'm so grateful for this chance. 
 Such a rare specimen. 
 The opportunities to study mutation... 
 Don't confuse your true purpose, nurse Sondra! 
 What we need from her is her wolf blood. 
 (Stammering) Of... of course. 
 Everything I do is for you. 
 And the Undoing. 
 You will get it for me. 
 And you will get it to work. 
 I chose you for a reason, Sondra. 
 (Sighing) 
 So, I heard about what happened. 
 Clay's pretty anxious. 
 Do you think you could try Savannah back? 
 I can't just... dial again when the connection's broken. 
 She must have just been interrupted. 
 If she can't connect with me, I can't force it. 
 What about that marble thing, I mean, can't that just find her? 
 You think that we wouldn't have done that already? 
 Sorry, I'm just trying to help. 
 I know. 
 I'm just feeling it today... 
 All the loss. 
 It's like I feel so powerless. 
 Powerless? 
 Are you kidding me? 
 First time I met you you made my eyes bleed. 
 We have a common enemy now, Paige. 
 We will find our people. 
 Together. 
 (Whispering) Okay. 
 She's dead. 
 I still don't understand how this is going to help. 
 There's still time. 
 For what? 
 A small electrical charge remains in the brain a few hours after death. 
 I'm going to need some salt, some fresh thyme, some lavender, candles, and a broom. 
 Really? 
 Huh, yes, a witch's broomstick. 
 Yes, some clichés are grounded in truth. 
 Whatever you need. 
 We're going to need to know her real name. 
 If we act quickly, we may get some valuable information. 
 I don't see how a funeral rite's going to give us new information. 
 We're not going to bury her... 
 She's going to tell us where Aleister is. 
 I saw what they gave you for breakfast. 
 I thought you could use something more substantial. 
 Oh... 
 (Electrical whirring) 
 Oh, no poison, no drugs. 
 (Laughs) I promise. 
 Mmm? Mm... 
 I know. This isn't easy. 
 But I'm here to help. 
 We just need a small sample, that's all. 
 You've already taken samples from every part of me. 
 What more do you need? 
 Just one little vial of blood. 
 After you've turned into a werewolf. 
 That's all you need? 
 Just my wolf blood? 
 That's all we need. 
 Not gonna happen. 
 If you don't give it willingly, it will be taken from you. 
 I'm just trying to protect you. 
 Oh, so now you're my friend, huh? 
 I recognize how special you are. 
 I don't want harm to come to you. 
 Why aren't you like everyone else, hypnotized? 
 I don't need "the focus" to have passion for my work. 
 This is a great honor, Elena. 
 You can lift the veil on so many mysteries. 
 Together, we can achieve great things. 
 I'm not going to help you. 
 You are blind, but you will see. 
 You also tried to make me deaf. 
 Was that all a part of protecting me? 
 Take her back to her cell. 
 For now. 
 (Suspenseful music) 
 (Heavy breathing) 
 ♪ 
 (Lock buzzing) 
 There is no way that you're doing this. 
 You can't contact the dead! 
 It is way too dangerous. 
 It will be fine, Paige. 
 Fine? 
 It is  dark  magic. 
 Left hand path. 
 You're the one who always says it is not our way. 
 We must do what's necessary. 
 But you have never done this. 
 No one in our Coven has tried this for, like, three generations. 
 Savannah is about to come into her powers. 
 That's why he took her, she's an easy mark. 
 He might lead her down the left hand path. 
 So, you'll flirt with dark magic to save her from what may happen? 
 That makes a lot of sense. 
 Paige, we need to know who he is, where he is. 
 This could be our last chance. 
 We need to find Savannah before he ruins the rest of her life. 
 Well, if he's a witch... 
 Not "if". 
 You know he's a witch. 
 Well, that means that somebody broke the commandment. 
 Savannah. Savannah! 
 Oh, what? 
 Elena : - We're breaking out of here. 
 I'm going to get you back to Paige and Ruth. 
 Have you been outside? 
 What can you see when you're out there? 
 I don't know... buildings, trees. 
 Savannah : Why? 
 Are there any mountains, water, a bridge, anything that could help get us out of here? 
 (Gasp) 
 Why should I trust you? 
 Savannah, Aleister is using you. 
 I am trying to help you. 
 You're a werewolf. 
 I'm locked up here because of you. It's for my safety. 
 Elena : Is that what he's telling you? 
 Look, you can trust me. 
 Okay? You're family came to us for help. 
 My mother's dead. 
 Paige and Ruth aren't my family. 
 They want to control me. 
 They may not be blood, okay, but they love you. 
 Elena : They care for you. 
 They just say they do. 
 Aleister wants me to reach my full potential. 
 Aleister is the one trying to control you! 
 Ugh!

 Guard? 
 The werewolf's bugging me.

 Elena : (Groaning in pain) 
 (Dull thudding) 
 Ah! 
 (Electric whirring and pulsing) 
 I know a thing or two about painting. Am I allowed to help? 
 Huh... 
 The mirror opposite of this hand. 
 All right. 
 How many witches are in your Coven? 
 There's just me and Paige, since Savannah's been taken, and Bridget... 
 There are several small covens across North America. 
 Yet yours is the only one on the hunt for Savannah. 
 You're playing it pretty close to the vest. 
 I know what that's like. 
 Better to keep it within the Pack. 
 There's something to be said for autonomy. 
 You said that witches never have male children. 
 Yet one seems to exist. 
 How is there a male witch? 
 If I knew the answer to that, I wouldn't need to do what... what I need to do. 
 You're not telling me something. 
 I'm telling you everything I know. 
 And I'm doing everything in my power to find out who Aleister is. 
 Of course you are. 
 (Wet thud) 
 
 
 
 (Lock clattering) 
 (Grunts of effort) 
 Logan? 
 My God, how did you get here? 
 Thank you! 
 Oh, I thought I lost you. 
 How are you? How's everything? Is he okay? 
 How's the baby? 
 I don't know. (Bell ringing) 
 I don't know. We keep doing these tests. 
 Logan, we have to get out of here. 
 Listen, I know where they hide the vehicles. 
 So we're just going to hike until dark, then I'm going to get us out of here. No! 
 The bell sounded. That means they're coming to take me to the Gentling room. 
 The what? W-w-w-what the hell happens in the Gentling room? 
 I will not go back there. We have to go now. 
 They... they come from that direction, two of them. 
 Okay, let's go. 
 (Panting)

 (Light switch clanging) 
 Ugh!

 You told them where to find me. 
 Richard? 
 When this door opens, I'm going to kill you. 
 Sondra : You will have a short time to Change. 
 (On loudspeaker)  This is a controlled experiment to observe combat. 
 Richard, don't do it. 
 That's exactly what they want you to do. 
 I told you everything that you needed to find Malcolm, and still, you gave me up to these sadistic bastards. 
 We're done talking. 
 90 seconds. 
 I didn't give you up, it's a lie. 
 They want you to fight me! 
 They... they want us to Change and then they'll kill us both! 
 Richard : Nice try. 
 You're trying to trick me so I won't Change. 
 Then you will. 
 There were other werewolves here. 
 Huh! Do you see them around? 
 They're in jars now! 
 If I don't fight you, I'll end up in jars too. 
 Richard... please. 
 Sondra :  60 seconds.

 (Menacing growl) 
 She's going to do it, we're almost there. 
 He's twice her size, he'll demolish her. 
 I've seen what she's capable of, she can hold her own. If he turns into a wolf and she doesn't, it's all over. 
 If he kills her, that's it, the only female will be destroyed. 
 She can die, just not as a human. 
 We need her wolf blood. 
 Ten...  nine, eight,  (Panting)  seven,  six, five, four,  three, two, one.

 She won't stand a chance.

 Clay did a missing persons database search. 
 Her name is Melanie Lau from Montreal. 
 Ruth : Thank you. 
 And thank you for understanding our need to keep this private, even from your own Pack. 
 It's not a magic we like to practice, much less show to anyone. 
 But you're welcome to stay. 
 What information will you be able to get? 
 Paige : It's hard to say, could be just fragments, pieces of memory... or worse: nothing. 
 (Whispering)  Spiritus, revive et dic per me. 
 I feel something. 
 Focus your energy at the north candle. 
 Sweetgrass. 
 Burn some at her feet. 
 The smell could... (Sharp gasp)

 Distant voice :  Mama! 
 Are you Melanie Lau? 
 Yes. 
 We need to find our loved ones. 
 Where are they?

 Daddy brought fresh daisies. 
 I needed to cut the gum from my dolly's hair. 
 Ah... Shhh! 
 Kenny felt me up. 
 Please don't fire me. 
 I really need this job. 
 The girl... 
 Savannah, where is she being held? 
 She's the one. 
 Her moon blood will purge us of our sins, for the Undoing. 
 What does Aleister want? 
 (Distorted screeching) 
 This isn't supposed to happen. 
 You take people. Where are they? 
 She is the key. 
 He will unlock it and set us free. 
 We need to stop! We need to ease her out! 
 Aleister, where is he? 
 What does he do to his followers? 
 We harvest the purple sea. 
 He purges us, it's for the Undoing. 
 Why are you taking our people? 
 No... 
 You don't know what you're doing! 
 This is killing her, we have to stop. 
 When is the Undoing? 
 You must die. 
 You all must die for the Undoing. 
 Where is he keeping them? 
 (Gasping) 
 (Whimpering) 
 I feel sick... 
 I need to... see Dr. Bauer. 
 No... 
 Who's Dr. Bauer? 
 Mom! It's killing her! Please! 
 (Panting, whimpering) 
 (Whispering) This is your last chance. 
 Please take it. 
 You want a thing done right, you have to do it yourself. 
 I chose Dr. Bauer to do one thing and she failed me because she's weak. 
 But you're not weak, are you? 
 I saw you kill Malcolm Danvers. 
 It was a thing of beauty. 
 I'll kill you too. 
 I promise. 
 I know you're in pain and that can stop. 
 You know what you have to do. 
 All we need is a little wolf blood. 
 It's not going to happen. 
 You're going to have to kill me. 
 Well... huh. 
 We'll have to kill someone. 
 Rachel : (Grunting) 
 Rachel! 
 Rachel : Elena! 
 Aleister : Ahh, so you do know each other. 
 How nice. 
 Reunion's over. 
 Time to change into a wolf. 
 Give me what I want or your friend dies. 
 I don't think more violence is... 
 Enough! 
 Let her go. 
 Sooner or later, people learn to give me what I want.

 Elena : Stop it! 
 Let her go! 
 (Gagging) 
 You're killing her! 
 Stop! 
 I'll do it. Now, that's what I like to hear.

 I just need a few minutes by myself to Change. 
 You can Change right now, or you can be responsible for this lady's death. 
 Two deaths, actually. 
 Don't you want to meet the baby? 
 Please, this goes against every... 
 Enough! 
 So what's it going to be, Elena? 
 Mm... 
 You were right about one thing, Sondra.

 I'll be fine. 
 Oh, it's good to be home. 
 We're not at home, we're still at Stonehaven. 
 Oh... oh, yes, of course. 
 We did what we had to do. 
 And Jeremy, I thought that we could trust him. 
 We have to tread gingerly with him. 
 With all of them. 
 Their first solution is to kill. 
 How can you ever trust someone like that? 
 That the good stuff? 
 It is. 
 Me too. 
 We're no closer to finding Elena. 
 We have some information to go on, starting with tracking down this Dr. Bauer. 
 Before the séance, I managed to get some information from Ruth. 
 There are at least two dozen more witches in the northeast and another coven knows that Ruth has been in contact with us. 
 Do they know Ruth and Paige are here? 
 We have to keep this under control. 
 If the Alpha Council finds out that the witches know about us and that we've aligned with them, we are all as good as dead. 
 We can't trust the witches. 
 Ruth just put her life on the line for us. 
 I think we can trust them. 
 She's not telling us everything. 
 We trust them only enough to get our people back. 
 We can never let our guard down.

 Savannah, I'm fine. 
 Oh-h! I thought you were dead.

 Are you okay? 
 Savannah : I don't know what to think, who to trust. 
 I know what that's like. 
 Here's how I judge. 
 Who stands by you when you're at your worst? 
 Ruth and Paige, I guess. 
 They're your family, they're the ones you should trust. 
 But they want to control me. 
 Elena : They want to protect you. 
 It's a fine line sometimes, but they're not going to give up on you, Savannah. 
 They want to find you very badly.

 Can you see the moon where you are? 
 Yeah. 
 Elena : Let me tell you a secret. 
 When I was young, I lost my mom too. 
 And my dad. 
 And did you feel alone? 
 Like you didn't belong anywhere? 
 I did. 
 But when I was alone, I'd look up at the full moon and I'd tell myself that my new family was out there, looking up at that same moon. 
 The moon is special to my Coven... to all witches. 
 Elena : Your Coven is out there... right now, under the same moon, searching for you. 
 They're going to find us. 
 Until then, I'll protect you. 
 I know what it's like to be scared and alone and not know who to trust.
