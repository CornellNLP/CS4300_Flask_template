 Previously on  Bitten ... 
 Jeremy : Your son is part of my Pack. 
 You will bring him to me and I will raise him. 
 Eduardo : You killed my Alpha. 
 An accusation without proof is just a story, and you have no proof. 
 Rachel : You're one of them, aren't you? 
 [Whispering] I never wanted you to see me that way. 
 A wolf. 
 Man : When a human finds out that we are werewolves, we have to kill them. 
 [Screaming] 
 Our Packs are a reflection of our leadership. 
 Your leadership is weak. 
 You thought that I saw you change so you were going to kill me? 
 I didn't have a choice, Elena. 
 Paige : Show me what love can be. 
 I will become leader of the coven. 
 And any chance of this will be gone. 
 Elena : I thought this place was going to be the end of us. 
 There is something that protects us. 
 It's love. 
 Elena : I need you to promise me that you won't tell anyone. 
 You're the only one who knows. 
 I know I should tell them, Clay even, but... 
 [Sighing] 
 What would I say? 
 That I'm going to cause our destruction? 
 If they knew what the future might hold... 
 They'd look at me differently, they'd be afraid. 
 This premonition, if that's what it is, makes me fear myself. 
 I fear I'm capable of burning it all to the ground. 
 [Shaky breaths] 
 So now that you know, when you look at me, what do you see? 
 Do you see this face? 
 Or the one covered in blood? 
 Can you forget it? 
 Because I can't. 
 That's why we keep secrets, because the truth changes everything. 
 I need you to tell me if there will ever... be a time when I close my eyes and I don't see it? 
 When will it stop? 
 It won't stop. 
 Not until it happens.

 Jeremy : For too long it's just been us. 
 Joey, Jorge, handful of Pack sympathisers who wanted to stay on our good side. 
 We've always... 
 I have always relied on our strength as a family to maintain order. 
 We've lost too many loved ones. 
 No more. 
 We will build our strength in numbers.

 Why you running, bro? 
 Why are you chasing me? 
 'Cause you're runnin'. 
 We build a net across the entire Pack territory and eliminate the wood Mutt. 
 So, one giant Pack? 
 And the ones who resist? 
 [Impact] 
 [Grunt] 
 There's no room for resistance. 
 You're better off answering my questions. 
 You joined the military, went overseas. 
 I did my tour, and no one found out what I am. 
 No one knows, I swear, you don't have to kill me. 
 Elena : How do we know they're with us by choice and not joining because they're afraid? 
 While you served you trained as a medic. 
 What do you want from me? 
 [Sighing] Not us. 
 Your Alpha Jeremy. 
 He wants you to join the Pack. 
 Jeremy : There will no longer be the choice between Pack or Mutt. 
 The choice will be Pack, or not being at all. 
 How many is enough? 
 All of them.

 I thought we had this conversation two years ago, Freddie. 
 No more counterfeiting. 
 You brought your brother in, cousin Leon. 
 Jeremy, I just follow the money. 
 What if you got caught? Go to prison? That's very bad for all of us. 
 Trick is, to never get caught. 
 Trick is, you thought we'd given you a choice. 
 Well then you left me alone! 
 We had more pressing needs to tend to. 
 I heard you're growing the Pack? 
 Bringing Mutts in? 
 Marsten's sippin' mojitos in Miami, Cain's up to his eyebrows in muff and muffuletas in New Orleans? 
 And what do I get?

 You'll get no fight from us today. 
 No, we work for you, now. 
 We're Pack, all the way.

 [Chuckling]

 I swear, sleep is getting harder and harder for him. 
 [Reading] "Your three-month-old baby is easily distracted at bed time because his vision has sharpened to 20/40," have you read these? 
 I haven't really had time to read what you brought. 
 Well I think this one is particularly helpful. 
 Are you giving him tummy time? 
 You need to promote those neck and core muscles. 
 We're okay, Nick. 
 I don't need a book to tell me how to do this. 
 [Sighing] 
 My postcards. 
 Yeah. Figured Bali was okay for now. 
 For now. 
 Come on, look, hey. 
 You're fake-travelling the world, you can send your family postcards from anywhere. 
 Think about it. 
 None of this is fair to them. 
 And the alternative? 
 I know it's bad. 
 Showing up in Toronto with a baby they never knew I had, telling them Logan left me... or the truth, that he died. 
 [Sigh] 
 I miss him so much, Nick. 
 Me too. 
 [Baby crying] 
 [Electricity buzzing] 
 What was that? 
 I don't know, the wiring, it's fine. 
 Well, let me check the fuse box. 
 Nick. It's fine. 
 I'll call a guy. 
 What do you mean, a guy? 
 You got a guy right here, just, let me go and... 
 It's fine. 
 You can't do everything around here. 
 Listen, Rachel, you can't have anyone in. 
 No visitors. 
 So, if you need something done, you let me know, and I'll send somebody. 
 Right. 
 You have to be careful. 
 Nobody's ever done this before. 
 Keeping a mother in the family? 
 I'm not in the family. 
 I mean, whatever this is, witness protection. 
 For now, pretending that I'm in Bali is fine. 
 I'm not ready to think of a life without Logan, yet. 
 I'm not ready to go home. 
 But, at some point I will be. 
 When that happens that's a larger conversation with Jeremy. 
 And how is that going to go? 
 Look, Rachel, I'm going to do everything that I possibly can to help you get through this, okay? 
 Okay. 
 [Sighing] 
 Elena : We've got a hit near Kamloops. 
 An alpaca farm, possible wolf attack. 
 Could be wild wolves, but there was overkill. 
 Better be safe than sorry. 
 Clay and I can be on the next flight out of Syracuse. 
 Let Jorge take it. 
 If he needs help we have a man in Aldergrove. 
 And another in Nanaimo. 
 There's no need for you to fly out. 
 That's why we unified our ranks. 
 So, what, we can deploy our recruits? 
 So that everyone has a hand in protecting our secrecy. 
 Jeremy, there's no guarantee that any of these new wolves are in it for the right reasons. 
 No, for some people staying alive is reason enough. 
 So, what, we take a day off going antiquing? 
 I guess I'll go over to Ithaca and check on Rachel. 
 Nick, do you need me to bring anything? 
 I'd rather you didn't do that. 
 It's enough that Nick sees her. 
 Jeremy, Rachel is my friend. 
 Seeing Rocco, it's like Logan is still with us. 
 I just said that Nick will be dealing with Rachel until I determine what her future holds. 
 Logan saved your life. I know. 
 But this is not about me. 
 This is not about what's right for any one us, it's what's best for  all  of us. 
 We are still a Pack, Elena. 
 [Suspenseful music] 
 Fine. 
 [Sighing] 
 We can still go to Kamloops if you want. 
 Jeremy didn't say we couldn't go, just, that we weren't needed. 
 And we can't see Rachel again? 
 It's not what he said. 
 Hey, let's do something. 
 Take your mind off all this. 
 We could go into town. 
 Look at some real estate postings. 
 Real estate? 
 Yeah, seems like a good time to think about our future. 
 House on the hill? 
 Something like that, yeah. 
 Enough room to run. 
 Chase a couple of kids around the yard. 
 Kids? 
 Is that the plan? 
 Maybe. 
 The Pack is finally big enough, we can step back a little. 
 And that's why you want to step away, to have kids. 
 Or do you want a little distance from Jeremy? 
 I know you're not happy with the changes he's made. 
 We both know not everyone is happy with the new world order. 
 It's not just me. 
 It's working. 
 Dictatorships work. 
 Until they don't. 
 This isn't a dictatorship, it's a Pack. 
 He's doing what an Alpha is meant to do, keep us safe, keep us on the right path. 
 He's creating stability and that's what we need.

 Oh man, I'm loving Alberta, never get sick of that air. 
 When you're ready to settle down, it's yours. 
 How's the campaign? 
 Well, they're pioneers, so they've only been told what to do. 
 But they're also sick of picking up and moving every couple of weeks. 
 They want to lay down routes. 
 So... 
 You got their attention. 
 But do I have their compliance? 
 They're all on board. 
 So what's next? 
 We push north. 
 Yukon, Northwest Territories, Alaska, that's where the fringe werewolves are. 
 The true wild. 
 I will not send anyone out there by themselves we meet them with numbers. 
 But for now, we're going to celebrate. 
 Man, the last time I was through Alberta, I came across this mangy, mangy wolf. 
 I convinced him to Change back for a conversation and a hot meal.

 It's my son Alexei, you met my daughter Katia. 
 Your human daughter, who knows what you are, what I am? 
 Yeah. 
 Okay, that doesn't happen, not without serious complications. 
 I'm sorry, Sasha Antonov? 
 We have spent months turning over every rock in North America. 
 I know every wolf in this territory, and I do not know you. 
 We've been living up north, in the Yukon. 
 Nobody knows about us. 
 When it's time to Change, I hunt caribou. 
 No one's ever heard, that's why you haven't heard of us. 
 We've kept an extremely low profile. 
 So, right now, you're approaching me here, in public? 
 And, you would have met with us in private? 
 No. 
 But instead you involve a human who knows everything about us. 
 Who blackmailed me into this conversation. 
 My God! 
 Look at you, it really is you. 
 That's it. 
 What are you doing? 
 Calling my family, they need to know about this, about her. 
 Please... 
 Not just yet, please, please. 
 You need to know who we are. 
 We're your family. 
 [Suspenseful music] 
 What? 
 Elena. 
 I am your father.
