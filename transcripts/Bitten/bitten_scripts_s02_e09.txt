 Previously on "Bitten". 
 What am I pregnant with? 
 A werewolf. 
 Paige : Witches believe in the prophecy of the Undoing. 
 A male child born to a witch is destined to bring about our downfall. 
 Clay : We killed you. 
 Aleister : With your help, I'll get what I need. 
 A great woman taught me this spell. 
 You don't have any control over your body. I do. 
 This isn't you. 
 Aleister : I have you locked away inside your mind. 
 Man : We think that Aleister's still alive and that he's possessed Clay to take Savannah. 
 Ruth : He's gonna try to kill Clay within a dark circle that he's drawn on the floor. 
 The man you love is already dead. 
 Jeremy : It's over, Aleister. 
 You took my son. 
 And now you're going to die. 
 (Screaming) Stop! (Screaming) 
 Aleister wasn't able to control us as wolves. 
 What if Clay can change? 
 (Groaning, growling) 
 Elena : Clay? 
 It's him. 
 (Music) 
 (Whimpering) 
 What's happening? 
 It's the beginning of the end. 
 (Music box plays) 
 Aleister : Okay, watch your step... 
 (Giggling, soft panting) 
 (Music box music) 
 Oh... Wow! 
 This is crazy. 
 Aleister : I'm glad you like it. 
 What is this place? It's like... out of a gothic novel or something. 
 This is the playroom. 
 (Music) 
 What game do you want to play? 
 (Music) 
 I have an idea. 
 (Chains jingling) 
 Good cop... 
 (Cuff ratcheting) 
 (Chuckle) Okay. 
 Bad cop... 
 (Music) 
 (Metallic clicks) 
 (Metallic clicks) 
 (Music) 
 (Laugh) 
 This better not end up online. 
 Private use only. 
 (Music) 
 (Music box plays) 
 (Rumbling) 
 (Gasp) 
 (Thud) 
 What was that? 
 Aleister : She's ready. 
 Woman : Whoa, whoa, whoa... 
 Who the hell are you? 
 What is this? 
 (Whimper) 
 Okay, let me out. 
 Stop! 
 Stop, let me out! 
 Clara : This one's perfect. 
 No, stop! I want to go home! 
 Aleister : Shhh. Quiet, now. 
 Are you ready to take her, Clara? 
 Yes... 
 I want her. 
 (Whimpering) 
 (Crying out) 
 Aleister : (Speaking unknown language) 
 Girl : (Groaning, gurgling) 
 (Music) 
 (Theme music) 
 Bitten 2x09 - Scavenger's Daughter 
Original air date: 04/04/2015 
 Jeremy : The witches said  it was the only way. 
 There's no way you could have known. 
 I almost killed you. 
 You almost killed  Aleister. 
 Okay? We're going to find him and end this. 
 We will. 
 Just to make sure you're okay first. 
 (Distorted rumbling) 
 Clay, something wrong? 
 Elena : Is it a concussion? 
 My eyes. 
 The photoreceptors shifted. 
 I'm fine. 
 I do not understand how you are still alive after a possession. It's... 
 Aleister was surprised, too. 
 He told me so himself. 
 He appeared to you? What did he say? 
 It's foggy. He said something about a woman, a great woman who taught him everything he knows. 
 Is that Clara? 
 We have to find her. 
 And what if she doesn't lead us back to Aleister? 
 The Undoing has begun. 
 I can feel across the Nexus all the other witches growing weaker. 
 Unless we kill him by sunrise, all the witches will be dead. 
 Just give me a minute. 
 Hey. 
 I've been looking all over for you. You okay? 
 Logan, when I said I needed space, I meant it. 
 You shouldn't be here. 
 I know, I just couldn't stop thinking about you. 
 I was worried. 
 I need my life back. And I can't do it with... 
 Honey, everything's okay, we're safe, I've made sure of it, I love you. 
 And I loved you. And where did it get me? 
 Kidnapped, experimented on, used in twisted rituals because of what you are! 
 I know, it's not your fault and you can't help it. 
 But I... I can't help how I feel. 
 Rachel, please, just let me fix this. 
 We have a baby on the way... 
 No. 
 He's  our  son, Rachel. 
 It's too late! 
 What do you mean? 
 No... 
 No, no, you didn't... 
 Tell me you didn't. 
 It's already done. 
 I'm sorry. 
 Bye, Logan. 
 (Music) 
 Easy. It's okay. 
 You're in good hands. 
 Clara. 
 Hm. 
 What are you doing here? 
 Aleister asked me to watch over you. 
 Saving you from the Coven took a lot out of him. 
 Why do you have my talisman? 
 To protect you. They can track you with this. 
 I'm sure you know what happened to your Aunt Clara. 
 They took away my powers by destroying my talisman. 
 We won't let that happen to you. 
 Why would they do that? They just made it for me. 
 Because they want to control you. 
 You're young and you're beautiful, and with this, you'll be more powerful than any of them ever were. 
 No more rules, no one to answer to. 
 The world will be yours. 
 Get your rest. 
 Tomorrow you start your new life. 
 (Music) 
 (Shaky exhalation) 
 (Sigh) She is asking too many questions. 
 You need to give her one more session to keep her in line. 
 She has to be locked down. She will be. 
 Soon enough it won't matter. 
 The witches will be dead. 
 It's the werewolves that concern me. 
 They're hunters. 
 What are you going to do with him? 
 (Rapid breaths) 
 He's going to make sure they don't find us. 
 (Muffled whimpering) 
 (Speaking unknown language) 
 (Screaming) 
 (Whimpering) 
 You can't just walk in and take my phone! 
 Give it back, you stupid bitch. 
 Like it or not, I got business I'm doing in there. 
 Like it or not, you'll let her go. 
 Ah, yeah? 
 Who the hell are you? 
 Who are  you? 
 A guy doing business in a sports bar, day-drinking in his best shirt? 
 You don't deserve her. Let her go. 
 (Whimper) 
 Bystanders : Oh-h-h! 
 (Grunting) 
 (Music) 
 Hey. 
 Try that again. 
 Bystanders : All right, all right, come on! 
 (Groaning) 
 (Mixed chuckles) 
 (Gasping) 
 Get out while you can. 
 Man : You sure can take a punch. 
 You're even better at throwing them. 
 Hey, listen, I don't want any more trouble, all right? 
 Hey, no trouble. 
 One shot! That is... impressive. 
 A guy like you, granite jaw, killer hook, I know a way you could make a thousand bucks tonight. 
 No thanks. I don't need the money. 
 No... 
 But you do need to scratch an itch. 
 Yeah, I've seen it before. 
 A guy does someone wrong, now he needs that sweet release of a good punch. 
 Throwing the punch or taking it. 
 I know a place. No gloves, no rules. 
 Just two guys working out their demons. 
 Like a fight club, or something? 
 Yeah. 
 Something like that. 
 Can those guys hit better than that guy at the bar? 
 Yeah. 
 They're a bunch of monsters. 
 (Crickets chirping) 
 Jeremy : Is it worse? 
 I can feel it progressing. 
 It's wearing me down. 
 I don't know how to fight someone who can attack from so far away. 
 It's the Left Hand Path. 
 Clara must have taught it to him. 
 She was an expert at it before we shunned her. 
 She could execute a man from her living room. 
 Then strike back. 
 Use that type of magic against Aleister. 
 It's very difficult. 
 I would need a strand of hair from a comb, saliva, something with his essence... 
 What? 
 There is something we can try. 
 I'll need an egg. 
 (Music) 
 The shroud was right here. 
 Essentia crescat. 
 One skin cell, one strand of hair, that's all I need to grow a piece of Aleister. 
 (Cracking) 
 There is no getting used to this. 
 What will this spell accomplish? 
 It will kill Aleister. 
 I just hope it does so in time. 
 (Gasping) 
 (Screaming) 
 (Whimpering) 
 What is it? 
 I don't know. 
 It's just my head. 
 It feels like an ice pick is piercing through my skull. 
 Is it the Undoing? 
 No, this is Ruth. 
 She's using dark magic. 
 She is desperate. 
 Ruth is attacking me? 
 She's slapping you with your own left hand. 
 We will see about that. 
 This is just the beginning. 
 It will help me to... 
 (Indistinct murmuring) 
 Savannah is trying to contact me. 
 I am... with you. 
 Ruth, is that you? 
 Savannah : Clara... 
 I knew it was you behind all this. 
 Who else would be so spiteful? 
 I'm not the one using Left Hand magic now, Ruth. 
 You're doing this to me. 
 You're trying to kill your own son, again. 
 And you will fail, again. 
 Listen to me, Aleister. 
 I was a 17-year-old girl. 
 I didn't have a choice. 
 It was the Prophesy. 
 Say it, Mother! 
 You ordered the execution of an innocent child. 
 Yes. 
 You were a problem and I needed you dead. 
 It was me. It was my choice. 
 But if you care about innocent people, then let them live. 
 No. None of you are innocent. 
 You vile woman. 
 May you all rot in hell. 
 (Small whimper) 
 (Music) 
 I will find you. 
 Who is that? 
 This is Jeremy. 
 Jeremy. 
 How is Clay since you stabbed him? 
 Has he forgiven you? No matter what happens, no matter where you try to hide, I will track you down. Savannah : I will find you and you will die watching your limbs being... ripped from your body. (Music) I will be ready for you. (Grunt) (Gasp) (Shaky breaths) There are windowless brick walls. There's a set of stairs leading to a floor above. They're underground. (Grunting in pain) What's wrong? I think tapping into your communication has done something... (Groaning) (Cracking) The Change... I'm... losing control. You have to call the others. Tell them to look for a basement. (Groaning, yelling) Nick : Doesn't look like anybody's here. Elena : Or they want us to think that. Anything? The house should have a basement, let's find a way down. (Music) This is interesting. Really? (Click, thud) Go get Clay and Elena. (Music) Nothing? Nick : You're bleeding. We need to move fast. That smell... It's death. (Eerie music) She's mummified. What did Clara do to her? Paige : It wasn't Clara. Aleister. Nick : Whatever it was... I think they filmed it. (Music) This guy you're up against... He's built like a truck. You sure you're up for this? I'm good. (Mixed shouting from other room) (Music) (Sniffing) Well, looky here! Zachary Cain. Thought you were dead. Clay spared my life, though he did take a little something of mine in exchange. Now you're going to pay for that. (Percussive music) (Thud) (Grunt) (Mixed shouting) (Mixed grunts) I've been tickled harder than that. (Growling) Oof! Did that tickle? Zachary : (Yelling) (Grunts) (Excited shouting) (Rapid heartbeat) Something's wrong. Don't you throw this fight! It's the Change. You've got to get me out of here, kid. (Grunts) You better stop it. I can't. Knock me out! (Music) Oh my gosh, kid, just choke me out. (Growling) (Choking) (Crickets chirping) That took all of my willpower to change back. That's never happened to me before. You're losing control. Yes. And earlier, Clay's eyesight was off and the wound on his head wouldn't heal. I thought that was a side effect of the possession. It's the Undoing. It's affecting you, too. If your abilities as a werewolf are becoming erratic, uncontrollable, it must mean that as we are dying... The werewolf curse is lifting. Yes. When we are gone, the curse will be no more. Won't be able to Change. Or Change back. There will be humans, and there will be wolves, and that will be that. So if I am a wolf at dawn... You will be for the rest of your life. We have to warn the rest of the Pack. Woman : (Choking) (Choking stops) (Gasp, deep breath) It worked! Aleister :  Is she gone? Clara :  I felt her consciousness disappear. It's amazing. It's the same thing he did to me. Aleister :  Do you want to keep her, Clara? We have time. Clara :  No. She's not what I need. We know it worked. Put me back in my body. Aleister :  Enter the circle, Clara. (Music) (Choking) (Music) (Choking stops) (Gasping, panting) When all the witches are dead, it will just be you and me. What are they planning? Clara wants to possess a new body. Who survives the Undoing? Clara will. She's no longer a witch. Aleister's protected since he's casting the spell, and Savannah because she's the conduit. But she said it would just be the two of them. She wants to possess Savannah's body. And take over Savannah's powers. 
 
 (Siren wailing in distance) Logan : Cain? What the hell you think you're doing here? Take it easy. I'm just here to warn you. Back at the fight, that Change, it wasn't random. Just got off the phone with Nick. He's saying the same thing is happening to werewolves everywhere. Come tomorrow, we won't be able to change anymore. What are you talking about? That's not possible. Well, it's happening. See, I'm still bleeding from the fight. Now, that's not normal. Come on. I'm just here to warn you. But, if you Change, that's it. You'll be dining on raccoons and garbage until the day you die. How can we stop it? You want to fight the thing that's causing this, you've got to fold in with the Pack. Huh, the Pack... Pfft. That's your call, brother. (Electronic beeping) What the hell is going on in there? It's not what. It's who. (Clicks, air hissing) (Sigh) Who is it? It's my girl, Amber. She wanted to be a wolf so bad. I think that psycho LeBlanc bit her. I told her it wouldn't work. You need to put her out of her misery. Misery? No... She's brain-dead. She can't feel a thing. The hell is all mine now. I just can't let her go. I can't. (Cellphone ringing) Rachel? Rachel : (On phone)  Logan, there's something wrong with the baby! You're still pregnant? I was afraid of what you are, so I lied to you. I'm so sorry. Logan, I need your help. I don't know what to do. Okay, okay, just... Where are you? I'm coming. (High-pitched squeal) We're wasting our time. We're not going to find anything here that'll lead us to Aleister. Have you felt anything yet? Some sounds are distorted, but I haven't felt the need to Change. You think it's true? That the curse is lifting? That we won't be werewolves anymore? Jeremy wouldn't say it if he didn't believe it. Look, I know what it means for us not be a wolves anymore, but if it happens, our lives become easier. They will. I love you for being the one to say that, but the wolf is what saved you. Everything that we've been fighting for, against Malcolm, against the Mutts, who we are, I mean, it'll all be gone. No. Not until dawn. Until then, we keep fighting. For the witches, for the pack, for each other. (Clattering) There's nothing here. Let's go. No, we can't just leave. We've got to find some... (Distorted rumbling) What is it? It's my... my eyes. (Shivering) It's so cold. Oh... Both : (Panting) (Rumbling, banging) What was that? (Music) Oh, this can't be happening. Nick! Paige! Can you hear me? Yeah, we hear you! Hold tight. We're going to find a way in. What the... Ah, Jesus. What the hell's going on? It's a Witches' Door. It's used for hiding spaces. Well... how do we open it? There's usually a trigger. Something's out of place. Everything on that table. Go. (Panting) Uh... I don't think that I can do much more. Clay and Elena will come save us, all right? It's going to be fine. Nick? We'll get out of here. I promise. Paige! (Music) Signum mortis. (Electricity buzzing) (Mixed whispers) (Distorted audio) (Chair clattering) (Gasp) Ruth, you okay? Oh, the magic is too much. Here... Sit down. You have to try again. I need to be where I can harness the power of the coven leaders who came before me. The catacombs. Our coven has used it since the 17th century. It's our sanctuary. Where is it? It's in Boston. The Delphi building was constructed on top of it. We still have time. I can get you there fast. No, I can't ask you to take me. If I can't defeat him, you should be with your Pack. They'll need your guidance. I've caused enough pain. (Car door closing) There's someone here. Rachel : (Moaning) Jeremy, there's something wrong with the baby. Let's get her to the couch. It's getting worse. As is the curse is lifting, it's affecting all the werewolves. It must be having an impact on the baby. It hurts so much! (Groaning) Okay, Rachel, pain is unavoidable, the suffering is optional. Fighting the pain is just going to make it worse. You have to breathe, okay? (Panting) Okay. Just get through the night, baby. Just get through the night. Our curse is being lifted, sweetheart. I won't have to Change into a wolf anymore. Our baby can be a normal baby and we... we'll be a normal family. You've made your choice, then, Logan. Jeremy... There's nothing more that needs to be said. Take Rachel upstairs to rest through the night. (Wincing, moaning) (Engine ignition) Ruth? (Vehicle departing) Ruth? Any luck? No. New plan. Watch out. (Grunting) Nick : Paige? Paige? Hey. How are you doing? Bloodroot. It's the only thing that will help me. Bloodroot? Okay. I don't know what that is, but we'll get some. We'll get some for you as soon as we get out of here. There's not much time. No, just... hang in there. Hang in there, babe. Hey... remember yesterday, when I said that I wasn't falling for you? Well, I lied. No, don't. No, no, no... Please don't. This is important, okay? You see through me. You... see beyond the jokes and the bravado and the... The hair. Yeah. (Soft chuckles) And the hair. I never thought that I could have what... Clay and Elena have, what... my father had with Lily... this... feeling. Shh. I know what you are doing. It's okay. You don't need to console me. No, no, no... that's not what I'm doing. I'm telling you that I need you. I'm telling you that I love you, Paige. That I'm not going to let you die. Okay? (Music) (Sobs, sniffles) Thank you. I wish that we had more time together. (Music) How the hell did we get here, kiddo? Huh? (Sigh) I'll tell you... (Sigh) we both love the wolf, babe. But the wolf's in trouble, and this is the only way to help what we both love survive. So this is for us. (Air hissing, clicking) (Air hissing stops) (Shaky breaths) (Sobbing) Nick : Paige is really sick! You have to get us out of here! (Grunt) - Damn it! Hey, hey... You're bleeding. (Door opening, closing) Someone's here. Paige... (Music) Something out of place... (Music) (Music) I'm here for the cursed ones. (Music) You're all going to die. No one else is here. (Music) (Grunts) (Cracking) Are you okay? Yeah. (Rumbling) (Bang) I don't know who the hell that is, but I'm hoping this bitch's house has a supply of bloodroot. (Percussive music) (Music) (Coughing) (Music) (Coughing) (Clicking, hinge creaking) (Wood cracking) (Thud) (Music) Aleister : Jeremy. You wanted to find me. Well, here I am. Where is my mother? I can feel she's not in the house. Desiste. I see your rage. And raise you mine. You will die, but how much pain you feel is up to you. I want Ruth. Tell me where she is. (Wincing) I suppose if you kill me, you'll never find her. (Growling) Jeremy : (Groaning in pain) (Wolf snarling) Oh... (Panting) (Wolf snarling) (Snarling) (Music) (Whimpering) (Whine) (Panting) (Mixed groaning) Ruth : (Speaking unknown language) (Shrieking) (Groaning in pain) That black spot on your face is getting bigger. Ahh! Your mother is killing you, Aleister. (Wolf panting, whimpering) (Music) Logan? Logan! Hey, wait, wait. You have to let him change. He's in pain, Jeremy! You have to do something! Jeremy : Aleister is here. He was going to kill us all. Logan changed to save us. Save him. (Music) (Rapid breaths) Oh... No. No. They're too deep. I can't do anything about that. (Music) Logan. I'm so sorry. Logan! I'm sorry Rachel. I never meant to bring you into this. And I never wanted you to see me that way. The wolf. You did that for Jeremy and me. What I saw was beautiful. And I love you for it. I'm sorry I lied about the baby. I'm sorry I pushed you away. I'm sorry. Listen to me. Listen to me. Our son... no matter what happens... don't you hide anything from him. You tell him... you tell him... tell him who I was. I was his dad. You're going to tell him. (Sobbing) We both know... I love you, Rachel... For you... For us. (Sobbing) (Grunting) I'm proud of you. (Rapid breaths) (Breathing stops) No... Logan, don't leave me! Logan! Logan! Elena? Elena : (On phone)  Jeremy, there was a complication. Is everyone all right? Yeah, we're on our way back. No. You have to go to Boston to protect Ruth. Aleister was here, he was looking for her. He was there? Paige will know where to take you. There is nothing for you to do here, now. Jeremy, what is going on? (Sigh) We have to get to Boston. Wait for me. (Music) (Coughing) (Music) (Retching) It's worse than before! More powerful. If the Undoing is killing Ruth, how is she killing me? There's only one way Ruth can manifest the power she needs for this type of magic. How? It's not how, where. I know where she's gone. (Grunt) How you feeling? Better. But it won't last long. Hey. I told you I would not let you die, and you won't. Not while I'm here. I believe you. Okay. Darling, you okay? Yeah. Just... my hearing is getting worse. This'll all be over soon. And no matter what happens, we face it together. What if we're forced to Change, like Jeremy? If you Change, I Change. I will live the rest of my life either human or wolf, but I will not live it apart from you. We fight together and we stay together. Zachary Cain. Alive and well. I take it Clay didn't tell you that he spared my life? Zachary, what are you doing here? Well, I came because I heard that we're facing the end of the werewolves. We're fighting against magic. There are witches in the world, and they are the cause of this. Witches, zombies, dragons, whatever. Jeremy, you just point me in the direction of what needs killing. (Music) Let's finish this. (Music) (Both gasp) What... what do you even say? I don't know. At this point. I just have so many emotions. I just didn't see that coming. I didn't expect that. Neither did I. What an ending as well. Man, well, stay with us for Innerspace : After Bite, the official aftershow for Bitten. What a fantastic episode and joining us are Greg Bryk, Genelle Williams and the very much alive Michael Xavier. That's because the character died. He's just.. Yeah, I know. Thanks for being so practical. I'm just emotional. Plus we'll have plenty of set secrets for you. We'll also meet the guys responsible for all the amazing fight scenes and don't miss our exclusive first look at next week's big season finale. It at starts... It's all starting right now.
