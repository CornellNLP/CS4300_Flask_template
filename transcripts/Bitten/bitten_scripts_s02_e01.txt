 Previously on "Bitten". 
 The Pack's rule is being challenged. 
 They want The Pack destroyed. 
 Right now we need to go on the offensive. 
 Jeremy : Turning humans into an army of werewolves is bad enough. 
 Recruiting serial killers... 
 Elena : My life here with you, that's the life that I want. 
 What about Clay? 
 Clay : What we have between us is the real thing or it's not, you decide. 
 Jeremy : What were you able to find out about James Williams? 
 Fake website run by some guy named Nate Parker. 
 Just looking for the guy that used to live here. 
 Only person that lived here was an old hag named Liz, and definitely no Nate. 
 It's time to storm the castle. 
 (Grunting) 
 Logan! 
 (Wolf growling) 
 Jakob Fenn. His father's still alive, maybe he'd want these. 
 Logan : She's gone! Rachel! 
 I've got to find her, she can't run. 
 Hey, hey. 
 The baby! 
 Malcom Danvers, it's a pleasure to finally meet you. 
 What is it that you really want, father? 
 A future. 
 Her.

 Man : (On speaker)  Once again from the top. 
 My name is Nate Parker. 
 I was hired by Malcolm Danvers a year ago to run the Toronto part of his plan. 
 The video of the wolves, I shot that. 
 Once again. 
 My name is Nate Parker! 
 Others were part of the Stonehaven plan, Mutts that bit in psychopaths. 
 I didn't... I didn't have anything to do with that. 
 Once again. 
 There's a meeting. 
 New recruits. I can tell you where. 
 I'll tell you everything you want to know.

 He's the one you want! 
 I've... I've told you where his house is, where the others are meeting. 
 He may be there, whatever else do you want to know? 
 I will tell you! 
 (Gasp) 
 Hello? 
 Hello!

 (Whimpering) 
 (Grunting) 
 Malcolm. 
 Where is he? 
 I don't know. 
 You have one second. 
 He... he tried to recruit me. 
 I hid instead. 
 I know better than to go against The Pack. 
 Let him talk. 
 What if I let him die instead? 
 Oh, no, no, there's a meet-up... for any Mutt that wants to join Malcolm. 
 4:30 at the docks. 
 How do you know that? 
 One of Malcolm's lackeys called me, um... Nate... 
 Nathan? 
 Ferret-faced guy. 
 He told me there'd be a meet-up for anyone who wanted to join Malcolm. 
 They'll know where Malcolm is. 
 I don't want any part of their crap. 
 I heard what they did to your boyfriend. 
 (Grunting, panting) 
 Nobody deserves to die like that. 
 (Shaky breaths) 
 (Grunting) 
 Jeremy : I understand the Alpha council's concern, but we cannot change what has happened. 
 (Russian accent) It is the actions of your Pack in the last few months that is the problem, Danvers. 
 That this Mutt uprising could happen on your territory in the first place is not without issue. 
 (Speaking in Korean) 
 I was not complacent with them, I made an example out of them. 
 I'm not interested in wallowing over whys and what-ifs. 
 Perhaps you want us to do what you cannot. 
 Find your father and kill him. 
 My Pack will find and kill Malcolm for what he's done: The Mutt uprising, the death of two of my Pack and seven innocent humans. 
 And he has taken something of great importance to us. 
 (Scoffing) 
 You see, our problem is not Malcolm Danvers. 
 (Speaking in Russian) 
 You know this Russian proverb? 
 "The fish rots from the head." 
 This is a Spanish proverb. 
 It is fact. 
 Our Packs are a reflection of our leadership. 
 And your leadership is weak. 
 You want to make an example of Malcolm? 
 We need to make an example of you. 
 An Alpha cannot show his throat like this. 
 Is not personal, is politics. 
 There's nothing more personal than politics. 
 You have one week to deliver us proof of Malcolm's death. 
 And if I don't? 
 We'll find him for you and take control of your Pack in the process. 
 Very well. 
 While my Pack searches for Malcolm here, It's spectacular. 
 I will stay and assist in the search for Malcolm. 
 That won't be necessary. 
 I insist. 
 It will be a chance for us to get to know each other, as Alphas. 
 I welcome your stay. 
 And when you gentlemen return, Malcolm's head will be on a stake. 
 My Pack is diligently searching for him now.

 Huh... so Jakob's dead. 
 What was he doing throwing in with Malcolm Danvers and attacking Stonehaven? 
 You deserve to know. 
 Elena speaks very highly of you. 
 She says you play by the rules. 
 You didn't come here to blow sunshine up my ass. 
 Or to tell me my son died. 
 Listen, I need to know what Jakob was up to before the attack on Stonehaven. 
 Did he ever mention where Malcolm may have based his operations? 
 See, Malcolm has something of mine, I need to go find it, get it back. 
 This ain't my problem. 
 Listen, it's my girlfriend. 
 That's who Malcolm has. 
 She's pregnant with my son. 
 You had a son, so surely you understand. 
 I need to find her, she's my life. 
 I got a couple of phone calls from Jakob a week ago. 
 He owed money to some meth dealer from Rochester, wanted me to pay him off next time I was through. 
 Okay, Rochester. 
 You have the number of that dealer? 
 Meet-up's in 30. 
 Eventually you're going to have to exhale. 
 I'm fine. 
 Can we finish this? 
 You're not fine. 
 It's only been three days since... 
 You can't ignore your grief. 
 You have to deal with Philip's death. 
 Jorge dealt with it. 
 Jorge dealt with covering it up. 
 And that's done. 
 But Phillip's sister has been texting me ever since. 
 As far as his family knows, his car crashed on the way to the airport and they assume I have nothing to do with it. 
 You didn't. 
 You know that's not true. 
 We're wasting time, let's go. 
 Elena... 
 I admire your sense of calm. 
 If I had a week to find my mortal enemy, I assure you, I wouldn't be entertaining guests. 
 Well... I admire your generosity, to help. 
 Most Alphas would've opted to see me fail, then staked a claim to my territory in North America. 
 The way he sat there in your chair. 
 Roman Navikev never turns down a chance to show disrespect. 
 No. 
 Not like your father. 
 There was an Alpha who ruled with his heart, not his fist. 
 What will you do if you don't find Malcolm? 
 He could slip away with the pregnant woman. 
 He could. 
 He hasn't had any money to speak of since I closed his account a few years ago, yet he managed an uprising. 
 You think someone is backing him? 
 Treachery is easier to hide from across an ocean. 
 And it does seem to be someone who is hungry for North America. 
 Navikev. 
 You are clever. 
 He underestimated you. 
 You will need proof. 
 Follow the money. 
 If I find that Roman was involved, do I have your support in killing him? 
 My support? 
 I swear to you on the blood of my infant son that I will personally place his head on a stake beside Malcolm's. 
 Wait at your hotel for word. 
 We will finish this... together. 
 Hm. 
 Not much of a meet-up. 
 Elena : One Mutt is all we need. 
 Elena : We're going to play a little game. 
 I ask, you answer. 
 Both : (Grunting) 
 (Metal banging) 
 Ughh! 
 Malcolm Danvers. Where is he? 
 You're going to let a girl do your fighting for you? 
 (Bang) 
 Ohhhh... 
 You got another stupid question? 
 Elena : Malcolm. Spit it out. 
 I don't know. You know as much as I do. 
 I know your contact is Nate Parker. 
 I've been calling him, you know, he's just not answering. 
 (Bone cracking) 
 (Yelling) 
 I also know you're meeting Mutts and taking them to Malcolm. 
 Looks like no one's interested in joining your failed uprising. 
 So tell us where he is and we'll put an end to this. 
 If I talk, Malcolm kills me. 
 Ugh! 
 Tell me what you know and I'll kill him. 
 You'll never get to him. 
 (Yelling, coughing) 
 I was the one that met your boyfriend at the airport. 
 (Groaning) 
 That was you? 
 I thought it was Malcolm. 
 Flight to France. 
 He didn't make it on. 
 It's 'cause I got to him first. 
 Go on. Tell me what happened! 
 Elena, don't, he's goading you to kill him. 
 He was scared. 
 He was begging for his life. 
 I took him to the warehouse. 
 I never decapitated someone before. 
 Elena. 
 Shh-h-h... she'll do a much better job than Malcolm ever would. 
 Tell me more. 
 It wasn't easy. 
 There was all this bone and cartilage. 
 Have you ever heard someone scream through gurgling blood? 
 (Yelling) 
 (Grunt of effort) 
 (Screaming) 
 I have now. 
 Dammit, Elena, he could've had more information. 
 Maybe we needed him. 
 Ughh! 
 We don't need him. 
 ♪ 
 Had to be done. 
 Fine, yes. 
 But you should leave the dirty work to me. 
 Just because you don't need the ghosts. 
 You already have enough. 
 And you don't? 
 We're here for the one true cursed, Malcolm Danvers. 
 Deliver him or die. 
 For the undoing, the destroyer comes. 
 (Fighting grunts) 
 ♪ 
 We are here for the one true cursed. 
 The werewolf Malcolm Danvers. 
 (Fighting grunts) 
 (Bones cracking) 
 Who the hell are they? 
 No IDs. 
 Hey, come take a look at this. 
 They all have it. 
 Stupid hipsters. 
 The way they came at us, it's like they don't feel pain. 
 And if they're after Malcolm, what's he gotten himself into?

 (Phone ringing) 
 Siobhan Devitt. 
 Joey : (On phone)  This is agent Franks from the Buffalo branch office of the FBI. 
 Listen, we've hit a dead end on a case. Would you be a sweetheart and pull up an account to see if there's any activity? Siobhan : (On phone)  That goes against bank policy. I know. Just look in the Philippines, see if there's been any charges. This guy is, um... sick. Ten-year-old girl sick. What's his name? James Williams. You can check a shell company: Viojandi Vodka. V-I-O-J-A-N-D-I. (Camera click) Nothing in the Philippines, sir. Oh, that's the best news I've heard all day. Thank you. We got it. Malcolm's account? Nick : (On phone)  Under the alias James Williams. It looks like a real travelling road show. There's withdrawals in... Des Moines, Vegas, Toronto. Before; nothing since the attack on Stonehaven. But... 27 days ago, money went out of the account to Rochester Power. Malcolm is making utility payments. That could be his base. I'll get on it. Jeremy : (On phone)  - Hold on. I'll conference in Clay and Elena. Hey, what's up? Jeremy :  - We have a lead on Malcolm. You have to get yourself to Rochester. We're over an hour away. Has anyone heard from Logan? He's still off the grid. We just got jumped at a Mutt meet-up... by humans. They're after Malcolm for some reason.  Malcolm? We have to get to him first. The other Alphas have given us a deadline to find him. And if we don't? That's not an option. We're on our way. Nick :  You didn't really answer Elena's question. What happens if we don't find Malcolm? Then I have to step down, give up my Pack  and my territory. Where's the money coming from? Um, it's a wire transfer... foreign account.  Which country? Russia. (Cynical chuckling) 
 
 Nick,  I need you to come back to Stonehaven. We have some business with the Spanish Alpha. And Joey? He's free to go. You are off the clock, my friend. You find him. You find Malcolm and you kill him. For our fathers. Logan : You find Rachel? Nick :  No, and I shouldn't be calling you without Jeremy knowing, but we've got a possible lead on Malcolm. Where? Look, there's no guarantee that Malcolm has Rachel, okay? What are you talking about? Of course he does. He was there at Stonehaven right when she went missing. Nick :  Look, I hear you, I'm just saying  there's no guarantee that she'll be there. Just... just where? Come on! Rochester. 63 Access Road 5. If you get there first, you wait for Clay and Elena. Are you close? I'm nowhere near Rochester. Clay and Elena will be there in an hour. If anything changes, I'll let you know. How far is Access Road 5? (Shouting) - How far? I don't know, 40 minutes? You're not eating? I've learned my lesson. But, the baby. You think the sedatives and this slop are good for him? Oh, I think they're good for you. (Shouting) She won't eat. We've got a problem. Nate is not returning my calls. Neither is the other Mutt that we sent for the meet-up. If the Pack can get to them, they can get to us. S... so we move? No. We prepare. (Shaky breath) Well, go ahead, you might want to sleep through the battle that's coming. Go see what that is. (Crow squawking) Man : Oh man. A bird in the house means something bad. Dead bird means something real bad. Or real good. (Ominous music) (Mixed whispers) What is happening? (Electricity crackles; eerie sounds stop, crickets chirp) Ahhh! ♪ Rachel? (Ominous music) (Thud) (Gasp) (Slow thuds continue) ♪ (Thud) Hey, hey, look at me. Where is she? (Heavy breathing) Where's Rachel? It's all coming to an end. We're all going to die. No! Who took her? (Car door closing) No, no, no, no, no, no! I don't want to go with them. Don't make me go with them. I can't take it. No, no, no! Where is she? Where did Malcolm take her? (Door opens, closes) What the hell happened here? Logan : I have no idea. I followed Malcolm's trail into the field out back, but... it was too faint. What about Rachel? Wait a minute. Wait. This is Rachel's. She was here. They could be out there. We've got to go. No, hang on. Have you slept? Look at you, you're a wreck. Look at me? Look at the blood. Look at the bodies. This guy was delusional. Whatever Malcolm did to him, to these Mutts, he has Rachel, we can't stop now! And go where? Anywhere but here. Come on. (Camera click) (Eerie music) (Grunting) Woman : Top you up? Keep the change. Thank you. Mighty kind. Nothing more life affirming than when all your plans and preparation go out the window. Man plans, God laughs. If that's the case, God's doubled over right now. Where you headed? How do you know I'm headed anywhere? I'm from nowhere, and even I wouldn't say this place is somewhere. I'm headed south, Mississippi Way. I can take you as far as Cincinnati. If you're in need for a drive. (Paper rustling) That's mighty kind too. (Ominous music) (Bees buzzing) Should we stop him? We're too exposed here. We follow him. Did you hear anything from Clay and Elena? It was carnage at the house. No sign of Malcolm or Rachel. This is no time to be delicate with Alpha politics. They've given you a deadline, Jeremy. We'll give them Malcolm. This is the way. Rodrigo Sanchez, may I present Nick Sorentino. Nick was in New York on business. He was tracking down Malcolm's accounts. Or rather the accounts of the alias that Malcolm was using, James Williams. Hmm. You tell Rodrigo what you found, Nick. Well, we tracked the money. And we found out that Malcolm was financed by a bank account that originated in Russia. You have the proof you needed. Roman Navikev is backing Malcolm. He is the fish that is rotting from head to tail. Jeremy : Yes. That was very convenient. Only, I know that Roman has never met with my father. And you say that you haven't either. Yet you know the woman he took was pregnant. I was very careful never to reveal that fact. What do you smell, Nick? (Deep inhalation) Fear. That's why werewolves can never play poker together. There are two ways to be a traitor, Rodrigo. You can be a man and do it in the open, or you can be a weasel. And you, my friend... are a weasel. You financed Malcolm through a Russian bank account so that I would blame Roman if I went looking. Jeremy, this is a mistake. No! Because you wanted Malcolm running things over here. If you want to live, you start talking right now. Where is Malcolm? Where is he? Malcolm called me an hour ago. He asked me to... to wire $200,000 to Baton Rouge. Baton Rouge. Clay might know where he is. Rodrigo : Th-that's all I know, I swear! (Choking) (Softly) Rodrigo, it would be a shame if I found out that you knew more and you didn't tell us. Especially about the pregnant girl. Malcolm is flying to Bangkok tomorrow night. What about the girl? That's all I know about her, except that Malcolm had her. If he gets on that flight, we've lost him. I could kill you right now, Rodrigo. Yeah? (Choking, straining) (Gasping) But I'm going to give you a chance to do the right thing. Every Pack would stand against you if they found out that you tried to frame Roman and steal my territory in North America. What would you have me do? You just stand by until I contact you. Say you have some business in New York. And trust me, if Roman ever found out what you had done, he wouldn't kill your infant son, he would skin him alive. Younger woman : Where did the werewolf go? Sequere lupus. Woman : Left it is, then. Malcolm : Any chance this truck goes faster? It might, but I don't. I like a steady pace. 8 hours, 15 minutes each way from our farm to my sister-in-law's place. You've got it down to a fine science. Been doing this drive a lot. My sister-in-law, she ain't doing too well. My wife goes up there, stays with her. Cancer of the pancreas. Yeah, you take her every time? You're a good man. I don't like her taking the bus. Strangers. You never know. True. What's your wife's name? Janine. Then I'm sorry, Janine. (Tires screeching) ♪ Elena : Those dead Mutts... how could Malcolm kill them all? This was on the neck of the people who attacked us. None of this makes any sense. (Phone buzzing) Malcolm's in Baton Rouge. Do you know where he'll be? Clayton : (On phone)  I have an idea. A spider hole he used to hide in when he was hurt. I'll text you the coordinates. Nick : (On phone)  There's something else. Jeremy didn't give you the full picture. The Alphas are threatening to force him out  if we don't find Malcolm. Then we find him. Jeremy and Nick are flying to Louisiana. They got a lead on Malcolm. Let's ditch your car, and we'll drive down there and get him. They might have Rachel. ♪ (Effort grunt) (Vehicle approaching) ♪ He's here. Logan : All right, let's go. What are we waiting for? Ah, ah, ah. We go in smart, we come out alive. And when we find her... I'll leave with her, take Mutt status. I'll raise my son as a Mutt, just like my father. Your son is part of my Pack. You will bring him to me... Jeremy. And I will raise him. This is not a negotiation, Logan. This is the way it's going to be. All right. But don't kill Malcolm until we know Rachel's safe. Please. I'm going to finish now what I should have finished back at Stonehaven. What I should have finished years ago. ♪ (Banging) Jeremy : Malcolm? Malcolm : You think I haven't been through worse this week? You're nothing. Jeremy : No? I tracked you down. How does it feel to be running scared, father?

Get me in the car and let's go. We can't stay anywhere too long. It's not safe. What, you think you're safe with us? I would kill you now if I could. And I would choose that over the other things I've seen this week. (Door creaks) (Footsteps) We'll work Malcolm over. If he knows where she is we may get that. Or we may get lies... or we may get nothing. Something came at me in Rochester. (Sighs) Is that what this is about? Malcolm : It was branded on their necks that symbol. It was also on the necks of the people who jumped us at the shipping yards. (Phone clicks) Were they responsible for this too? I've scratched the surface of what that means, Clay, and nothing good could come from it. You need to keep me alive for what's coming. (Grunts) (Car door slams) I found this inside. It's the same symbol. Yeah. I'm going to stay on. Look into it. A professor I know in Tulane specializing in Pagan symbology. Yeah, but what if it's nothing? What if he's just messing with us? No... I saw something in Malcolm's eyes I've never seen before. Fear. Do you want me to stay? No, I want you to be there when Jeremy kills him. And before that, you don't let him get in your head. He can't get in my head if he's separated from his. What now? We can't distract them all. Wherever they're taking Malcolm Danvers... is where we are going.
