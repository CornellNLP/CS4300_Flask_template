 Previously on "Bitten"... 
 (Grunt of pain) 
 Remember our buddy Michael Braxton? 
 Well, he's missing. Last night, he said he was going to go over to your place, make things square. 
 In the meantime, we have two Mutts to deal with. 
 We need to identify the dead one from the rave, and find out who made him. 
 There is someone out there who knows the Mutt rumour mill better than us. 
 Karl Marsten. 
 What we want to know is who bit him. 
 I'll find out who bit your little problem. 
 Clay : Keeps a scrapbook. 
 A nurse in Milwaukee, a college student in Cleveland. 
 All tortured, all killed. 
 Someone's turning psychotic murderers into werewolves. 
 Zachary Cain. 
 Clay : Something's not right. 
 Cain's not smart enough come up with a plan. 
 Karl Marsten... 
 Since when do Mutts work together? 
 Never. 
 Daniel Santos. 
 Convince Jeremy and Clay to let me come to Stonehaven. 
 Let's talk about joining forces to deal with the situation. 
 First, they convert new Mutts. 
 We made you, we own you. 
 Second, they attack us directly, murdering people. 
 (Suspenseful ♪) 
 ( ♪ ) 
 Let him try. 
 Jeremy : Turning humans into an army of werewolves is bad enough. 
 But recruiting serial killers? 
 Marsten and Cain are coming after us with both barrels loaded. 
 Did you see this one? 
 Skinned her. 
 That's enough. 
 The rate they're able to drop dead bodies on us, they can't be far. 
 Marsten showed up pretty quickly after Nick called him at the bar. 
 So I say we search between here and Syracuse. 
 I am not sending anybody blindly out chasing after Marsten and Cain. 
 We need to be strategic about this. 
 I've sent word through Logan to Daniel Santos that I'm willing to talk. 
 Ha! Santos doesn't talk so much as lie. 
 He wants to trade information he has for reinstatement into the Pack. 
 And I know he cannot be trusted, but I am at least willing to listen to what he has to say. 
 The last member of the Santos family that walked through our doors tried to kill you. 
 Jeremy : Our backs are up against a wall here. 
 I need something to smoke Marsten and his crew out. 
 Then let me lure this one. 
 Let me be the bait. 
 I'm the "bitch" that he wants. 
 No. 
 We will find them together. 
 Elena... 
 (Mixed chatter) 
 Pete : We're only in town a few days, dude. 
 Just think about it, okay? 
 Canadian girls. 
 They're hot and they're polite. 
 So what, they thank you for never calling them again? 
 Exactly! 
 I'm going to use that. 
 (Mixed chuckling) 
 Can I help you? 
 No, I'm waiting for Dr. Danvers. Thanks. 
 Dr. Danvers. 
 He's a bit of a brooder. 
 I'm... I'm just here for the typist job. 
 You, uh... you sure you want to work for him? 
 I'm sure I want to pay my tuition, yeah. 
 Why don't you just get your parents to pay for it? 
 My parents are dead. 
 Look, I just saw the job posting, I grabbed it and ran up here. 
 ...excuse me. Dude, I wanted to show you this thing over here... 
 As for Dr. Danvers, I'm pretty sure I can get up to speed on whatever it is that he does. 
 He does this. 
 Look, about the whole parents thing. 
 It's not a sob story. 
 I don't want you to think that it is. 
 I'm sorry, I thought you were a student. 
 Yeah, I... I get that often. 
 Sorry. 
 Um... l... listen, I'm a little tied up with my cousins at the moment, but can... 
 Yeah. 
 Can you come back tomorrow? 
 Okay. 
 Great. 
 Okay. 
 Have a nice day. 
 Thanks. 
 (In Southern accent) Well, I do declare! 
 That girl put a blush on your cheeks, the likes of which I've never seen before. 
 I don't know what you're talking about. 
 (Chuckling) 
 (Heavy sigh) 
 Dude, careful. 
 That is a minefield you do not know how to navigate. 
 I can give you some tips. 
 No. 
 Nothing is going to happen. 
 That's Braxton's truck, all right. 
 Who called it in? 
 It's an anonymous tip. 
 Sheriff? 
 This is some real Manson family business we got going on here. 
 Yeah, if the guy's a trigger-happy drinker, he could've hit a pothole and shot himself. 
 With all that's gone on, it's getting kind of hard not to think foul play, isn't it? 
 ( ♪ ) 
 ( ♪ ) 
 Bitten 1x05 - Bitten Original air date February 8, 2014 
 You might be on to something with Marsten. 
 There's a lot of cabins and warehouses between here and Syracuse. 
 Doesn't matter. 
 We got our orders. 
 We feign some business at Nick's club. 
 He'll cover for us. 
 We track the area, see what we can find. 
 You'd go against Jeremy? 
 Right now, I would. 
 (Car approaching, short siren blast) 
 I haven't seen Braxton since his dog lunged at Elena. 
 Word is, he was coming up here to have it out with you. 
 His dog's still missing. 
 His dog never showed up. Neither did he. 
 Yeah, well, vehicle was found deserted right by your property line. 
 Are we being accused of something here? 
 There's a trail of blood, leads from his truck towards your land. 
 He could be out here somewhere, injured or incapacitated. 
 If I did anything to the guy, why would I leave his truck at the edge of our property? 
 It suggests proximity. 
 And so here we are, again. 
 But we have nothing to do with this other than proximity. 
 Look, the tow truck driver is a friend of Braxton's. 
 In about 20 minutes, word is going to hit town and people are going to start pointing fingers at you. 
 So let them point. 
 I didn't do anything. 
 We all want this to come to a quick end. 
 You are more than welcome to search the property. 
 Now, it is a big piece of land. 
 Maybe we should organize a search party. 
 Some locals, members of my family, they know the land. 
 If Michael Braxton's here, we'll find him. 
 (Sigh) 
 I'd appreciate that. 
 Yeah, I'm going to go to town and round up some people. 
 Deputy O'Neil, you stay here and deal with them as they arrive. 
 (Door closing) 
 I'm sure you heard that you will be helping with the search. 
 This is Marsten's doing, I know it. 
 He must've heard Braxton running his mouth off in town, nabbed him, and then dumped his truck. 
 And hung it on us. 
 Not us. 
 On Clay. 
 There's a very real possibility that Braxton's body is out there. 
 Mutts wouldn't leave him alive to tell the truth. 
 Jeremy : Which is why we are allowing the police onto our property, and which is why we will help them look. 
 If Braxton is here, this is the best chance for us to mitigate the situation when the body is found. 
 So why not stall them? 
 Let me rip out there and see what's what. 
 Not with Deputy Dipshit keeping watch. 
 The police are going to get a search warrant for this house. 
 And the last thing we need is anybody poking around in here. 
 So we will help them. 
 Barely making mortgage payments these guys living like it's goddamn Skyfall up here. 
 No way. No way! 
 The Danvers family has offered to help with the search. 
 There is no way that he's going on this search. 
 This town's been through a lot, I'm just looking to help. 
 Oh, yeah, you want to help? 
 Why don't you help by making me not have to look at your face? 
 Stand down, everyone. We have a long day ahead of us. 
 Sheriff Morgan, Clay and I have some family business that we could attend to inside. 
 Clay? 
 Morgan : Here's how we're going to run this. 
 We have 100-acre plot of land to cover. 
 We're going to fan out, we're going to march it in a grid formation. 
 Keep the person on either side of you within sight. 
 If Michael Braxton is out there, we will find him. 
 (Sigh) 
 Okay. 
 It's not about the money. 
 (High-pitched ring) 
 Elena's voice :  Well, I do need the money, but it's... 
 It's more than that to me. 
 I read your book. 
 Every single page. That's not right. Why wouldn't I read every single page? Okay... (Soft ♪) (Pounding heartbeat) ( ♪ ) Oh, if you were leaving, I can... I wasn't leaving. I was opening the door for you. How did you know...? Come in. Are you coming or going? I'm here, but what's the point in unpacking when I just have to pack it again at the end of the semester. What's the point of inhaling if you're just going to exhale? Zeus, right? It's beautiful. Just as he's about to seduce Leda. He couldn't come to her in his true form, because she wouldn't have him. But he loved her. See yesterday, I didn't know that. But I read your book. You read my book... I did. Look, I really want this job. And I won't take no for an answer. Sorry. Um, take a seat. Uh, look... I'll be honest. Um, I'm not sure that this is going to work out. Why not? Well, for starters, other than my book, do you know anything about anthropomorphic religions? Well, the-the job is for a typist, not a T.A. So, I don't see... But I dictate, and there's a lot of specific terminology. I don't have time to train you. I don't need to be trained. I'm actually quite self-sufficient. So if you just point me in the right direction... Right. How do you spell "Tlingit"? Seriously? It'll be part of my new book. So, how do you spell it? Does it start with "F-U"? You know what? If you don't want to hire me, then don't. But stop looking for reasons not to. Because there aren't any. Wait. Before you go, write this down. Okay. T-L-I-N-G-I-T. Tlingit. They're an indigenous people from the Pacific northwest coast. Let's begin. ( ♪ ) We have got a lot of ground to cover today, people. If you see anything, and I mean anything, give a holler. I'm going to keep my eye on you. Just in case you decide to tamper with any evidence you may find. I was thinking the same thing about you too. Let's get this done today, folks. (Mixed chatter) Man : (On monitor) Everything's there. Although... I don't think the clothes you came in with are going to fit you anymore. My time in here was well-spent. In more ways than one. We'll get you a clothing voucher for the Sally Ann, and a bus pass. I'll be honest with you, Victor. I hate the thought of letting you out, regardless of the sentence served. The Parole Board turned you down three times for good reason. I needed to stay in here, to really learn my lesson. And I've kept my nose clean. It's an adult facility. There's nothing that would interest you here. I'm done with all that. You sound confident. Well... I'm in love. You? Mm-hmm. See, sometimes the internet can be used for good. Her name's Amber. She's a Capricorn. Likes long walks on the beach and... music. How old is she? Like I said, I'm done with that. I should be out there. I think it would best if you were in here when Daniel arrived. Why are you giving him the time of day? The guy can't be trusted. Do you remember when I first found you? You had already been bitten. You were just this feral little boy, abandoned in the swamp. Do you remember how many days I had to sit quietly on that tree stump until you would approach me? Till you learned to trust me? Weeks. Am I sitting on a metaphorical tree stump right now? No. Clay, every decision I make is to protect the future of this Pack. Same as the choices I've made. Good. Then we're on the same page. (Cellphone chiming) (Clears throat) Hey. When are you coming home? Elena : (On phone)  Uhh... It's complicated. Okay, I don't want to turn this into an Olympics of complicated, but we are gold medalling over here right now. What's happening? Becky's other bridesmaid has appendicitis  and now she can't fly back from England, so Becky is in a tailspin, and she's not very good  with change. (Sigh) You need help? Yes! Is there any way you can step in? Um...  Becky adores you,  the dress is already here in Toronto, it just needs a little snip-tuck. Uhh...  And it would also mean you coming back A.S.A.P. Hey, hon! Elena : Hey! (High-pitched ring) Philip :  Sorry about the ambush. You have a lot on your plate. Uh, kind of... But, um... You know what? Tell Becky I'd be honoured. Really? You are amazing. Sometimes. Philip :  All right. Hurry home. I love you. You too. Told ya! When is she coming back? Uh, that, I do not know. Well, when's the funeral? Few days ago. She didn't want you there? Did you take a date to Dad's funeral? Yeah, but you're hardly a date. Yeah, you're starting to sound a little like mom. (Gasp) (Thud) (Chuckle) What? I couldn't help but listen. What did you hear? A man's voice, telling you he loves you. Does Clay know? Just Logan and Jeremy. And now you. Look, I left Stonehaven, Nick. I moved on. I thought you were going to start on that last night. I tried. I'll help you. Not exactly what I wanted to be doing on spend my last two days with you. (Heavy sigh) Hey... Buck up. Look, I know change is hard, but some university will be very lucky to have you. And you'll find a new assistant who knows how to spell "Tlingit" without being taught. And you? I'll survive. I always do. I'm not very good at this. What? At this. I can't pack. I'm not ready to go. I've never felt this way before. I thought it would... go away, this feeling but... I'm sort of drowning. Me too. What do we do? ( ♪ ) (Panting) ( ♪ ) (Ominous ♪) ( ♪ ) (Flies buzzing) (High-pitched ring) You smell that? It's Braxton. He's dead. You sure? Positive. He's up ahead on our path. We have to throw a wrench in this or we're done. What are you thinking? (Cries of pain) (Grunting) You okay? Yeah, I slipped on a root. (Whispering) Pick a fight. (Grunting) You'll have to get that on ice. Yeah. Can you walk on it? I should be able to make it home, yeah. You know, all of this, because your friend wanted to blame us for what's gone down around here. My friend's missing, you son of a bitch! (Grunts of combat) Travis : Get the hell off me! (Mixed shouting) (Continued grunting) Break it up! Break it up! (Continued grunting) Enough! Are we done here? All right! Sheriff Morgan : Deputy O'Neil, call in the State Troopers. Everybody, back to your cars. (Panting) O'Neil : Nice one, hero. Go on, Deputy. (Sigh) (Flies buzzing) (Soft ♪) ( ♪ ) Hey. (Laughing) Don't be nervous, okay? We're going to be fine. Oh, when you put it that way, I feel nervous. Look, this is a big deal, bringing me home to your family. What if Jeremy doesn't like me? Impossible. Okay then, I'll come clean. I've never met anyone's family before. Not... you know, in this context. Not in the context of, "This is someone that I love" "and I want to spend the rest of my life with" "and if you don't like me then..." Darlin', I got you. (Soft chuckle) Okay. There's just one thing, I, uh... I didn't tell him we were coming. Does he at least know we're engaged? I'm not going to ambush him. Okay... Look, just go inside and tell him, and I'll wait out here. Okay. (Sombre ♪) (Rustling) (Twig snapping) (Groaning) (Snarling) (Groan) ( ♪ ) Hey! Hey! Hey. He's not here. Come in. It's fine. You sure? Trust me. Okay. (Chuckle) (Bones cracking) (Door opening) (Soft ♪) ( ♪ ) Wow. ( ♪ ) Let me guess. Haida? Haida Gwaii, exactly. (Chuckle) When I was a kid, I used to sleep right here on the floor, staring up at it. I could smell the... the moss, the smoke, the ocean. The endless expanse of forest. Is it a bear? It's a wolf. 
 
 Elena, this is Jeremy. Elena : I'm so glad to finally meet you. I'm sorry I wasn't here to properly greet you when you arrived. I wasn't expecting guests. Come in. Honestly, we should have given you some head's up. You know? Nothing worse than being caught off guard. Ah... This is amazing. Clay's description doesn't do it justice. Why don't you make yourself comfortable while I put on some tea? And then we can get to know each other. Clay, join me. He's upset, I can tell. Can you just make this better, please? Okay. I wish you told me that you were coming here with a friend, Clayton. You put me in a very difficult situation. And those rings... Are you married to this girl? Engaged. I know it's sudden. It's... crazy. I can't explain it, but I love her. We don't get to love. I thought maybe if... You thought wrong. Stonehaven is our sanctuary. It's not for outsiders. You should not have brought her here. I can... I can take her to the city. We can stay away. I wish it was that easy. ( ♪ ) Elena : Where's Clay? Just a little problem up at a one of the neighbour's down the road. Oh, um... Is everything all right? It'll be fine. Just sent Clay in to give them a hand. He'll be back in a little while. Must be hard being out here on your own. You know, isolated. I don't mind the isolation. You don't get scared? Of what in particular? Um... I don't know. Sometimes, I go out in the woods and see things. You know? Strange things. Hmm. What a gorgeous dog. He's massive. Clay... Did Clay let him out? It's okay. I don't mind. Hi! See? He likes me. (Soft thud) (Whimper) Elena : Ah-h! (Wincing) Did he break the skin? Um... No, he just nipped me. Let me see. It's okay. No, it's... okay. Let me see. No, no, no, no... Don't... don't be mad at him. It was just an accident. Ahh... ( ♪ ) Um... I think I need to... I think I need to sit down. ( ♪ ) (Snarling) ( ♪ ) Philip : This is amazing. Where did you find this? One of the board members found it on the internet. Made us all watch it. I know it's a stretch, but if we could work this into the campaign somehow, this will buy me a lot of goodwill with the Board. Sure, I can make this work. Let me sit with it for a little bit and I'll have something to pitch you this afternoon. Say, 4:00 o'clock? You're a good man. I appreciate this. All right. (Growling) Sheriff... I'm sorry you had to cut that search short. I apologize for Nick's behaviour. He's not usually like that. I should've just called the Staties in the first place. I cut a corner, that's all. I won't be cutting corners anymore. (Heavy sigh) She's moving the body. Body? Yeah, he's dead. But Elena's on it. We should be out there. (Ominous ♪) ( ♪ ) Daniel Santos. Did I miss the party? ( ♪ ) Jeremy : It's been a while since a Santos set foot in this house. Yes. Does my brother's blood still stain the carpet? That was a long time ago. I hope you're beyond that. He got what he deserved. You don't come at the Alpha without anticipating payback. Full house. Though, I was hoping to see Elena as well. Love to show her how my ear has healed since she, uh, took a bite. You lunged at her. The two of you showed up unannounced in my hotel room. The lights were out. Thought she was the hooker I ordered. As if you couldn't smell she was wolf. An honest mistake. I see the error of my ways. ( ♪ ) So I have a bold suggestion, but I think it's a winner for this market. I am a huge fan of bold moves. So we rebrand. Same product. Different name. We play to the roots. It's a tip of the hat to Estonia. I looked up the Estonian word for "wolf" and it's "hunt". Hunt Vodka? "The Thrill of the Hunt". It's very good. But this video, can we get the rights? Why don't you leave that to me on my side as well. I'll track down the shooter. Jeremy : Logan tells me that you're interested in realigning with the Pack. Daniel : When my family cleaved from the Pack, I was just a kid. I followed them, foolishly believing that Malcolm deserved the right to Alpha instead of you. I placed myself on the wrong side of history. I want to make things right. How so? I'm here to talk about Karl Marsten. But I think Elena should be here for this as well. And I'd rather not start without her. Clay : She'll make it. I know she will. Jeremy : No, she won't. She won't. You have to be honest with yourself, Clayton. No woman has ever survived the Change. But the best we can hope for is we can stay with her until the Change kills her. (Footsteps) (Water trickling) (Grunt) ( ♪ ) Why am I here? Jeremy : Drink this. (Grunt) Your body will need it. What did you do to me? (Panting) Did you drug me? (Clattering) (Grunting) (Panting) Where is Clay? I sent him away for what he's done. For biting you. The dog bit me. (Eerie, distorted audio) ( ♪ ) Ugh... What's happening? You're very sick, Elena. Clay bit you. It was not a dog. (Panting) He was a wolf. We are all wolves. Ah-h... I was born that way, Elena. Clay was bitten. (Groaning) And now you've been bitten too. (Grunting) You're becoming like us. What is happening to you right now is called the first Change. And unfortunately, you are about to experience a world of pain unlike anything you've ever felt before. I'm sorry. (Gasping) Ah-h... (Laboured breathing) (Screaming) Please help me. Please... Don't fight it. (Grunting) Elena, listen to me very carefully. Listen to me now! Don't fight the pain. It will kill you. It will kill you. (Yelling in pain) (Grunting) (Cracking) (Screaming) Elena, you have to go with the pain. You need to let this pass through you. Ahhh... (Bones cracking) Let the pain take you where you need to go. (Gasping, yelling) (Snarling, growling) (Quiet growling) ( ♪ ) Clay... Elena... (Laboured breathing) I'm sorry. I... I don't even know how to explain it. How to explain what? Why you bit me? I loved you. I trusted you. I just want you to hold me. I'm so cold. (Lock clicking) (Gasping) I've missed you so much. (Sigh) (Thud) (Grunt) ( ♪ ) (Soft ♪) ( ♪ ) Daniel : ...especially where she's concerned. Elena... how lovely to see you. Get to the point. I was promised a fair trade. Information for Pack status. I want your protection. It isn't safe out there for a lone wolf anymore. Jeremy : You're willing to risk retaliation to align with us? Daniel : Marsten and Cain are building an army. They've turned two psychopathic serial killers. To counter the one that you have. I was just being honest. It's isn't your strong suit. Neither is bringing information, apparently. Well, that's what I'm trying to tell you: that everything they're doing is because of you, Clay. You've been in contact with Marsten? Grapevine. And what I hear is that for the two years that Elena was your sidekick, and the two of you policed the Mutts, she at least brought some humanity. But you on your own? Brutal. Vindictive, even. An individual Mutt stands no chance against you. They had no choice but to band together. And they're creating a psycho army to help in the process. Clay : I didn't do anything to Marsten. If this is about Clay, why did they kill Pete? To knock you off your game. To send Clay out on a blind rage. Look, the King moves one square at a time. Thoughtful, methodical. And the Queen... Well, she can do whatever she wants. But the rook? Stuck in a rut. Zigzag. Zigzag. We all know that you act irrationally. You're impulsive. You make mistakes. Isn't that right, Elena? That's enough. Still a slimeball, Santos. Nothing's changed. Please... understand, what I've said comes from good intentions. Those being... reinstatement to the Pack. Well, we'll give that due consideration. Nick, let's show him out. Yeah. Don't forget. The Queen can make any move she wants. (Door closing) Nick told me what happened. I should've been out there with you. I had to drag a dead body across the property today to protect you and the Pack. And if that wasn't enough, I couldn't grab him, because my prints would be all over him. So I had to do the one thing that I hate the most. I had to Change. And all of this, because of you. You know if I could take it back... the bite... But you can't. It's impossible for you to understand, but I did it because I love you. I'm going home. ( ♪ ) I'm so tired. Clay : I know. Just let me die. Clay : Not a chance, darlin'. You're going to survive because that's what you do. You survive. You always have. I knew you had it in you from the start. Come on. But you can't live out here. Not yet. Jeremy will teach you. ( ♪ ) Cool if I sit? Sure. Free country. Thanks. You waiting on someone? Internet thing with a girl named Amber. Ah... (Scoff) Should've known better. Ah, women. They got us by the short and curlies, coming or going. They make promises. Fill our heads with possibilities. But they're never in the moment. (Chuckle) Never in the moment. Except when they're pointing their finger at you from across the court room, right? (Chuckling) Oh, easy! I'm not a boyfriend or a brother of one of your victims. I'm a friend. Come on. Have a seat. I promise I won't bite. How'd you know where to find me? Ah... Oh, you're Amber. No. (Chuckle) Look, I don't know what you're into or why you're here, but I'm done with kids. Well, I really don't care about that. What I do care about is payback. You spent a lot of time in prison sh1tting in a bucket because of those girls. Those girls. I loved them. What we had... it was special. Maybe someone should make them hurt a little too, huh? At least one of them in particular. Which one? Elena Michaels. Zachary Cain. Victor. Victor Olson. (Whistling) Elena... The body's off the property in a grove. But someone will stumble over it in the next few days. Should buy you enough time to find Marsten. What you did may have saved Clay. And probably saved all of us. Maybe... for now. I have to go to a wedding... for the sister of the man that I love and trust. I used to think that I could trust Clay, but I was wrong. Elena, I think that it might be time... And then you taught me to trust again. You're the closest thing I've ever had to a father. I came because you called. I can't say no when you call. So I'm asking you not to. ( ♪ ) ♪ I will be standing by ( ♪ ) ♪ I will be standing by ( ♪ ) ♪ I will be standing by (Camera shutter click) No Equal. (Triumphant ♪)
