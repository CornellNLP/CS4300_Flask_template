 Previously on "Bitten"... 
 I am the lock. 
 I am the key. 
 Savannah : I tried to resist, but he's too strong. 
 I keep having this vision that you're getting killed. 
 A premonition of something that will happen. 
 Ruth : The Undoing has begun. 
 Unless we kill him by sunrise, all the witches will be dead. 
 Jeremy : What will the spell accomplish? 
 Ruth : It will kill Aleister. 
 I just hope it does so in time. 
 If your abilities as a werewolf are becoming erratic or uncontrollable, it must mean that as we are dying... 
 The werewolf curse is lifted. 
 Well, looky here. 
 Zachary Cain? 
 I just got off the phone with Nick. 
 Come tomorrow, we won't be able to Change anymore. 
 Cain : Jeremy, you just point me in the direction of what needs killing. 
 I want Ruth. Tell me where she is! 
 (Snarling) 
 (Roaring) 
 Rachel : (Screaming) 
 (Panting) 
 They're too deep. 
 Logan, don't leave me! 
 (Crying) Logan! 
 Ruth : I need to be where I can harness the power of the Coven leaders who came before me. 
 The catacombs. 
 There's only one way Ruth can manifest the power she needs for this type of magic. 
 I know where she's gone. 
 Let's finish this. 
 (Distorted, high-pitched effects) 
 (Groaning in pain) 
 (Panting, wheezing) 
 Clay : It's okay... 
 Argh! 
 Is he okay? 
 It's the first wave of the Change. 
 He's caught in the pain. 
 Cain : It's affecting all of us. 
 Oh, save your strength, sweetheart. 
 How are you alive? 
 We came to an understanding. 
 I'm with you on this, all right? 
 One with the Pack. 
 Did you reach Logan? Is he coming? 
 Logan was with me at Stonehaven. 
 Aleister attacked us, he was looking for Ruth. 
 Jeremy, what happened? 
 He fought very bravely. 
 The wound was terrible. 
 What are you saying? 
 Logan is dead. 
 No... 
 Logan died with Rachel by his side. 
 (Pained whimpering) 
 (Gasping) Nick... 
 Jeremy : She's still back at Stonehaven. 
 We have to see this through, and then we will go back and we will bury him. 
 Aleister's inside. Where? 
 Ruth started a spell to kill Aleister. 
 He's going to try to find her and stop it. 
 Paige : She'll be in our sacred ritual room, in the catacombs beneath the building. 
 (Panting) 
 Whoa, whoa, whoa. 
 Are you all right? 
 (Groan) 
 Elena, are you okay? 
 Elena's voice : Dead by dawn. 
 I am dead by dawn. 
 Savannah : (Screaming) 
 None of us are okay. 
 If we don't stop the Undoing, we'll never be all right again. 
 (Groaning, choking) 
 (Panicked panting) 
 (♪) 
 Paige : To get to the ritual room, you need to be with me. 
 The entrance to the boiler room will only open to a Coven witch. 
 (Moaning) 
 Okay, hold on a sec, here, all right? 
 'Cause we're in a cat box full of crap. 
 Your lives, our existence, is all on the line. 
 I just want to get one thing straight, okay? 
 If this young witch is the bomb mechanism to this whole... Undoing... 
 If she's in there... can't we just, you know, snuff her? 
 No! She's innocent. 
 None of this is her fault. 
 Well, there's a lot of innocent people who are going to die if we don't end this quickly. 
 Hey, you want to fight for us? 
 Aleister is our target. Not Savannah! 
 End of conversation. 
 Nick : (Screaming) 
 Jeremy : Go, go with them. 
 You need to fight through the Change, now. We have to go. 
 Don't worry about me. 
 I'm going in there, but I can't Change. 
 Not if it means I can't Change get back. 
 I went to Hawkesbury. I saw my mother. 
 And now I know how much she loved Antonio and I want that! 
 I want what Clay and Elena have. 
 What Logan had. 
 And I... I can't do that as a wolf. 
 (Groaning) 
 Fight the Change, Nick. Fight the Change. 
 Aleister's put a spell on the doors. 
 Paige : So don't touch them. 
 (Chuckling) Spell... 
 Can he spell "suck it"? 
 Touch them, and you die. 
 Can you do anything? 
 (Grunting) 
 (Shattering) 
 Yeah, that works. 
 Yeah. 
 (♪) 
 Paige. 
 (♪) 
 If you're trying to kill me, Ruth, you'll have to hurry! 
 It's almost dawn. 
 (Sighing) 
 (Mixed eerie whispers) 
 (♪) 
 (Crunching, shattering) 
 (Incantation in Latin) 
 (Yelling) 
 That bitch. 
 We have to hurry. 
 Paige. 
 What is it? 
 She's in the building. 
 Deal with it, Aleister. 
 Keep your sister busy, while we kill your mother. 
 (Groaning, panting) 
 Obstructio viae. 
 (Crunching glass) 
 Hey, where to? 
 Get off me, Wolf. 
 Paige? 
 You vile... 
 Gun! 
 (Gunshots) 
 (♪) 
 Stay here. 
 (Gunshots continue) 
 (Grunting, yelling) 
 (Gunshot) 
 Jeremy : Hey! 
 (Grunt) 
 He is the One true path. 
 (Vertebrae crunch) 
 Aleister has control of the guards. 
 You need to fight. You okay? 
 Yeah. 
 Yeah? 
 Yeah. 
 Dammit. Come on! 
 How do we get to Ruth from here? 
 If you try and stop him, he will kill you. 
 (Gasp) 
 Hey. 
 (Groaning) 
 Savannah showed you her premonition. 
 You're rushing straight into the arms of your own death. 
 We have to get back up. 
 That's key card only, bro. 
 Ah, there's gotta be stairs. 
 In case you didn't notice, we're not armed. 
 They are. I know you showed me mercy, but it doesn't mean I'm gonna take a bullet for you. 
 Your life is your own. Do what you want. 
 I have to find Elena. 
 Okay, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait! 
 Hold up! All right? 
 She's not waiting around up there. 
 They're looking for the boiler room. 
 You want to find her, we've got to go down. 
 (♪) 
 You okay? Can you still fight the Change? 
 It's only an hour till dawn. I got this. 
 You all right? 
 Yeah. 
 You smell that? 
 Humans. 
 Where's it coming from? 
 Right here. 
 Brace yourself. 
 (Elevator chime) 
 (Fighting grunts) 
 (♪) 
 (Chime) 
 Hey listen, fellas, I got a lot on my plate right now. 
 What do you say... 
 (Combat yells) 
 (♪) 
 (Distorted music) 
 Occide filium. 
 (Screaming) 
 Where is she? 
 Where is Ruth? 
 Go into your blood. 
 Sense the power rising through the floor. 
 The secret ritual chambers are below us. 
 There's only one way in. 
 She thinks she can kill me? 
 She's failed at that at least once before. 
 Aleister : (Strained grunt) 
 Only a Coven witch can open it. 
 (Gasping) 
 Aleister : Savannah, open the door. 
 Take us to Ruth! 
 Lock her down again while she has her talisman. 
 She's a shell, even with her talisman. 
 And once we cross that threshold, we have no idea how the powers of the Coven will affect her. 
 Savannah, I am the lock. 
 (Mixed whispers) 
 And I am the key. 
 Ruth's here. 
 (Growling) Good! 
 (Chime) 
 (Grunting) 
 (♪) 
 (Bone cracking) 
 (♪) 
 (Vertebrae cracking) 
 Nick! 
 Hello, mother... 
 I've come home. 
 You got my message. 
 Loud and clear. 
 I have a few tricks of my own. 
 Your little Savannah let us in. 
 Savannah, listen to me. 
 They are going to kill you, and Clara is going to take possession of your body. 
 She's gone, mother, under a deep ocean of calm. 
 It's a place I had to go to many times when my father beat me. 
 I didn't intend for your life to be so full of pain. 
 You never intended for me to have a life at all. 
 But these powers you gave me, they came in handy. 
 I killed that man. He wasn't my father. 
 Do you even know who was, whore? 
 Come and say that to my face. 
 Don't get too close! 
 If she gets your blood in that bowl, you'll be dead in seconds. 
 She won't break the Circle. 
 It's the only thing protecting her. 
 (Grunts, gasps) 
 Occide fil... 
 Drag her out! (Groaning) (Yelp) You shouldn't have broken the Circle, Ruth! And now you're going to die, mother... along with all the rest of them. Occide matrim. We have to get to Ruth. (Roaring) (Distorted voice) Why rush to your death if I could do it now? Paige... (Grunting) listen to yourself. Aleister has you under a spell. This isn't you. This is me...  killing you. (Grunting, snarling) Paige, look at me. Focus! (Groaning, snarling) (Deep, unearthly voice) Get off me, bitch! Listen to me. Do you understand? He's going to kill your mother. (Yell) Occide... (♪) Think about Ruth... How much you love her. Think about the Coven. (Silent choking) (Gasping) You can't let Aleister win. You're stronger than him. You can fight this. (Yelling, gasping) (Sobbing) What happened? How did we get here? Aleister had you. Hey... are you back? Yeah? (Panting) Okay. Yeah. Can you walk? Yeah. Okay. (Mumbling) Elena : Take me to Ruth. Nothing's happening. You have no power down here. Kill her! (In Latin) (Effort grunts) (Panicked gasps) (♪) You failed. I failed 30 years ago. You failed because you are a coward. You couldn't do the one thing you were supposed to to save your beloved witches. That wasn't my failure. No, I could have protected you. I should have protected you. You could have loved me. I'm sorry, my son. Are you going to believe her? She demanded that I kill you! She's trying to trick you. It didn't have to be this way. You're not sorry for what you did. You're sorry that I survived. It's locked! Dammit! Wait, wait, wait, wait, think, okay? We can probably heave those two phone booths through this window. If we go outside, we're back to square one. At least we're not stuck in here. You want to find your girl or not? All right. (Gunshots) I'm not the greatest at math, but this feels a whole lot like square one. (♪) Paige : (Coughing) Are you okay? Paige! (Groaning) Hey. Come on. (Metal creaking) (Effort gasp) Is it that close to dawn? Paige, you've got to get us in there. (Mixed eerie whispers) (Hinges screech) Can you keep it open for the others? No. It'll close once we're through. Okay, wait here. You're going to have to let them in. What are you going to do? I'm going to finish it. No, Elena... I know that you're going to do whatever it takes... to kill Aleister. But if you can't... Savannah's the conduit. If you end the Undoing, we will have a fighting chance to take him down, together. I'm not saying that this is right, or that it'll be easy. But if it comes to this... you have to be prepared to sacrifice Savannah. (♪) (Gunshot) (Gasping) Clay : Keep him distracted. I'm going to Change. I can take him down. What if you can't Change back? I have to take the chance! Yeah, but then you'll never be with Elena. All right? And being without the one you love the most, for guys like us, that's the worst pain in the world. Believe me, Clay, it ain't no life to live. (Gun clicking on empty chamber) So whatever you do, just never let her go. What are you doing? I'm going to go get that mall cop's key card. 
 
 (♪) (Gunshots) (♪) Ugh! (Grunting) Cain! (Groaning) Look what I got. You better make this worth it, bro. Hey. Go get her. These things I've done, the years of pain. My boy. There's still time. We can unwind it all. I can take away all the hurt. Clara : Don't listen to her. She's lying. Stop this. You were just trying to buy time. (Grunt) Ahh! Aleister! (Grunting) (Clinking) I will bleed the life from you, wolf. You're not holding me back. You don't have any power in here, do you? Savannah? Savannah, listen to me. He's controlling you, but you're stronger than him. I am the lock. And I am the key. Aleister : She's gone, Elena. Drowning in your blood. And there is nothing you can do to save her. (Grunt of anger) (♪) (Fighting grunts continue) Clara : The athame. Here! Aleister : (Gasp) (Grunting) (Groan) (Gasping) (♪) In the end, you die protecting them, and because of them. Their athame. Your blood. Ah! (Pained moans) This isn't the end. I'm sorry, Savannah. This is the only way. Ugh! (Panting with effort) (Grunt) (Flesh squishing) (♪) (Gasping) (Panting) Elena, what is happening? They can't control you. No. We have to go. No! Quickly! No! Let me go! Stop! (Gasping) (Grunt) Jeremy! (♪) Ugh! (Baton clanking) Ugh! (♪) (Sobbing painfully) Elena? (Panting) Elena! You hang on, okay? Okay, I'm going to get you out of here. Go to him. There's no time. I'm not leaving you. (Sobbing and panting) (♪) I love you so much. (Sobbing) (♪) (Struggled breathing) (Breathing stops) Elena? Say something! Say something! (Yelling) (♪) (Banging on door) Paige : Nick! Nick : Paige! We've got to get out of here. No, I'll let you in. We can go together. Listen to me... Clay and Elena are in there. I open this door, they're coming through. I don't know how long I can hold them, go. But... Please. Just do this for me. (Mixed eerie whispers) (Eerie music) Nick? Nick! Clay : (Sobbing) I'm so sorry. I'm sorry I couldn't get to you, darlin'. Paige : Mother! (Heavy breathing) Clay? Where is he? Where's Aleister? He's taken Savannah deep into the catacombs. And that's where I'll kill him. Are you going to Change? There's no reason for me to stay human anymore. (♪) (Sobbing) (♪) Nick : (in far distance) Jeremy! Jeremy, where are you! Jeremy! Jeremy! (Banging) (Struggling) Jeremy : Back away. (Door slam) (Punching thuds) (Muffled pained groans) What are you doing? I'm doing what must be done, Paige. You don't have the strength to do this. This is the strongest thing I can do. It's all I have left to fight him with. Please. There must be another way. Not for me. This is all because of me, my failures. I have to make at least this one thing right. No, I won't let you. The ring is already on her. It's already started. Accept this. And understand it's because I love you. Mom... (♪) Spiritus, ostende mihi viam... No. Please, I need you. Mom, mom, I need you. Spiritus, revive. (Panting) Aleister : (Gasping with pain) Let me go! There's no way out. Oh, God. She's out of the spell. I have her talisman. What can she do? Move a glass? Slam a door? I will make you suffer for what you did to Elena. She had to pay, Savannah. For her defiance. As will you. (Chuckling) You won't live long past sunrise. Once daylight breaks through the ceiling, the Undoing will be over. The witches will be dead, there will be no one to save you. And I will possess your body. No. I won't let you in. You'll fight it, Savannah. But you will lose. As well as the rest of Elena's family. Once I have your powers, I intend to kill them. I can't have them getting in the way of all the fun I'm going to have. I promise I'll take good care of your body. (Laughing) (Chuckling) (Roaring) (Gasping) (Snarling) Spiritus, revive. Come on, Elena. (Sharp gasp) Aaaggh! (Struggling) Mom! Mom, I am not ready for this. I'm not ready for this, mom! No... (Moaning, gasping) Mom... (Whispering) You will shine. (Eerie effects) (♪) (Crying) Mom! Mom! (Gasping) She brought you back. Huh? You were dead, Elena. Can you save her? (Sobbing) (♪) Thank you. Clay was here when I died. He went after Aleister. As a wolf. Where? (Sobbing) (♪) Thank you. (Snarling) No... (In Latin) (Roaring) (Growling) How do I have my power again? The catacombs are not protected if the Coven leader is dead. Ruth! Ohh... If Ruth is dead, it must be dawn. Then where is the light? (Growling) Ah... (Roaring) (Moaning) (Panting) (Growling) (Roaring) (Eerie effects) (Snarling) (Whimpering) (Moaning) Savannah! Dies courtati! Oh...! (Choking) (Liquid squishing) (Gurgling) (Gasping) Aleister : I didn't think you had it in you. You heard Clara... Ahh! If Ruth is dead, the Undoing is already here. (Grunt) Ah! I have no more use for you, Savannah. This is the way the world ends. Both : (Struggling) (♪) You going to fight me, Savannah? (Moaning) (♪) (Groaning) (Grunting) Ugh! (Gasping, coughing) (Heavy breathing) (Choking) You were dead. You were wrong. So fitting that it comes down to us. The only male witch. The only female werewolf. You put up a good fight. But all good things must come to an end. They will. Right now. Desiste! Ugh! (Clinking) (Grunting) (Muffled bubbling) (Dramatic string music) (♪) (Muffled heartbeat) (Heartbeat slowing down) (Silence) Savannah : The daylight. Elena, it's dawn. I don't know if I killed him in time to stop the Undoing. Paige. Clay... Clay, please. I know you did this for the right reasons. That you thought all hope was gone. (Sobbing) If I didn't do this in time... If we really are lost... I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. (Weak growl) You did what was right. And I love you. (Sobbing) Elena? It's dawn. I don't know if it worked, Jeremy. Have you seen Paige? If she's okay then... She let me in, but I was in the corridor when dawn broke. Everything that we have... If I'd just been one second faster, but then the light came in, and it was dawn. What if this is it? Paige : It's done. It's over. (Moaning) (Bones, flesh creaking) Jeremy : What your mother did for Elena, for all of us... Paige : She saved us. Savannah : But she's gone. No, she's not. She's in this place, and her spirit guides us. Always. There was a time when you came to me, and I turned you away. I promise you, I will never turn you away again. We are bound together by all of this. Let me clean this up for you. Come on. So I brought all the bodies down here, cleaned up upstairs. It's all taken care of. Your mother... I can stay. I'd like that, but you can't. We need time to heal, to build. For now. Thank you, Nick Sorrentino. Oh, I didn't do anything... But you did. You didn't know it at the time, neither of us did. But after Savannah and I bury Ruth, I will become leader of the Coven. And any chance of this... will be gone. But for a happy moment, you showed me... what love could be. And for that I thank you. Let's go. Let's get out of here. I thought this place was going to be the end of us. That's impossible, darlin'. Whatever it is, fate, magic, there is something that protects us. It's love. (♪) Savannah : It's all my fault. I did this. All this... because of me. Don't do that. Don't blame yourself. You were under a spell. Because I let him in. You let me in too. You are powerful, Savannah. You always have a choice. Don't ever forget that. I won't. It's strange. For the first time, in what seems for a very long time... I finally feel like myself. Well then, it's nice to finally meet you. (Mixed distorted effects) (Mixed screams)
