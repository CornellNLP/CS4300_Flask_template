 [Indistinct chattering] 
 [door whirs] 
 Do you have any pets? 
 Um, I'm allergic. 
 Oh... How many cats do you have? 
 Six. Hey, do you have a taser? 
 Have you ever had to tase someone? 
 Yeah, yeah. 
 Have you ever tased yourself? 
 Dennis : You're such a naughty girl. 
 Hey. 
 [radio static] 
 I'll see you at lunch. 
 Oh, that's... 
 [chuckles] 
 Did you see that? 
 See what? 
 Me, just now. 
 No. 
 Then ask me what's new. 
 [Sighs] Okay, Dawn, what is new? 
 Huh? 
 [gasps] 
 Oh, sh1t! 
 I did it. 
 You... you... you and Patsy got married? 
 No, no, no, no. 
 Not him. 
 I'm Dawn Beardman. 
 I married Dennis. 
 The security guard. 
 Dawn, you are sh1tting me. 
 Okay, well, if "sh1tting me" means "congratulations," then thank you. 
 [laughs] 
 Honestly, I don't know what it means. 
 What did you do? 
 I... You know what? 
 I just would like you to be happy for me, okay? 
 And I know that you will once you get to know him. 
 So, I would like you to come to Nanny's after work today. 
 It would mean a lot to me, I could order a cake, and it would be like a reception. 
 But I gotta work in the gift shop until 6:00, so... 
 Well, that's okay. You know what? 
 We can just do it in the gift shop. 
 I'll just bring a little cake. 
 Please? He makes me happy. 
 Come on. Cake in the gift shop. 
 [Squeaks] 
 Getting On - 02x06 
 Doctor Death The proposal is to enter into a sister hospital relationship with the Matibabu Hospital in the Siaya District in Kenya continuing Mount Palms Medical Center's commitment to humanity, wherever it may be. 
 Dr. Mwangangi... 
 We are the only hospital or clinic to dispense vitally-needed HIV medications within 200 miles and we boast a 12-bed pediatric unit for babies with Malaria. 
 We must create a road map for support services and a true sister hospital dashboard for interactive, internet-based consultations, webinars. 
 And it is urgent that we act fast. 
 Well, I think we can all agree that speed is of the essence in a situation like this. 
 [mouthing] 
 Paul : Excellent. 
 Oh, thank you so much. 
 Mrs. Bly Poppley. 
 Good morning, Mrs. Poppley. 
 She's here recovering from a knee replacement, but we discovered something she managed to keep hidden from the medical team at the hospital. 
 A little friend on her back. 
 Oh, good Lord. 
 That's a large squamous cell skin cancer. 
 Quite large. 
 Um, genital warts. 
 Have you had genital warts, Mrs. Poppley? 
 Not to my knowledge. 
 No, I wouldn't think so. 
 And you are most likely not a chimney sweep? 
 Poppley : No. 
 Jenna : No. 
 So, what do we do? 
 Cauterize it? 
 A course of radiation? 
 Um, I'm... 
 [sighs] I think electrocautery. 
 It's basically a hot wire, usually around 12 volts, supplied by a transformer plugged into the main. 
 Will it hurt? 
 Jenna : No. 
 When a lesion is this thick and horny, we don't just use topical. 
 That'll all be done back at the hospital, so not to worry about that. 
 All right. Dawn... 
 Two eggs, sunny-side up, bacon, French toast, orange juice, and a cappuccino. 
 Thanks, Colleen. 
 Hi. I'm Colleen. 
 I'm Olive. 
 Hi, Olive. 
 I think today might be her day. 
 Hi, This is Didi Ortley. 
 Is that you, Dr. James? 
 Of course it's you. 
 Dr. James, we need to talk, and I'm doing it this way, so I won't be disrespectful to you in person. 
 But what is up with you? 
 I asked around, and I found out that I should be making $10,000 to $15,000 more as Hospice Nurse Liaison. 
 Instead, I'm only making 30¢ an hour more. 
 Dr. James, you gotta make this right. 
 I'm giving you until 11:00 a.m. today, back wages and everything. 
 This is Didi Ortley, signing off. 
 [Phone rings] 
 Oh boy. 
 Hello? 
 Paul! 
 Uh, no, sorry, I can't. 
 I'm just about to start rounds. 
 Immediately? 
 Well, then, certainly. 
 The Commtee Room? 
 Okay. 
 Paul, Rick. 
 Jenna, thank you for coming. 
 You've all met? 
 No. 
 Oh, we have in-house counsel, our attorneys from Hansen, Bowes. 
 Um, we have Public Relations, Community Liaison. 
 All right. 
 Paul : We have, um, a problem that we need to discuss. 
 It concerns your hospice program. 
 Oh, okay. 
 At 9:18, we got a call from Medicaid. 
 At 9:29, we got a call from the "Long Beach Press-Courier." 
 The hospital has been accused of having become a death mill. 
 What does that mean? 
 Paul : Well, it means your hospice program has grown so big and so quickly... 
 Well, three comfort suites. 
 Well, that's a bit disingenuous, Jenna. 
 You've also commandeered some 47 scatter beds throughout the hospital. 
 Counsel : Medicaid has examined your bi-monthly reports... 
 Mm-hmm. 
 And raised multiple red flags. 
 They've identified repeated unjustified hospice enrollments of non-terminal patients with vague diagnoses. Mm-hmm. 
 Groundless recertification of terminal illness status, uh, bilking Medicaid... 
 "Bilking Medicaid"? 
 Well, you sanctioned this. 
 You... you received your share of the profits. 
 Are you seriously implying that this program that you built, that you ran and administered, that somehow I'm... 
 No. No, I'm not. 
 I'm not. 
 The embarrassment, the grave humiliation that would befall this medical center. 
 Rick : The enormous penalties and fines. 
 Uh-huh, yeah. 
 Rick : Legal is going to need access to all of your records and files. 
 Su... Absolutely. 
 Uh, they're scattered in various locations, but I absolutely can gather those together, because, really, everything is actually fine. 
 Paul : Okay, all right. So, um, would you be comfortable if we initiate a preliminary statement to the press courier denying that you're Dr. Death? 
 And, I'm... 
 Sure... 
 Yeah, I'm gonna need a report from you on what's what, what our exposure is, by end of day. 
 Reiterating Rick, we need to make sure that everything you've done can withstand withering scrutiny. 
 [Piano music playing] 
 Oh, Dr. James. 
 [mutters] 
 I spoke to the admit nurse and to the discharge nurse and they will not take Beverly Poppley back. 
 They said that the excision of the lesion on her back... that it's an outpatient procedure. 
 It's the size of a wallet. 
 They really expect us to do that here? 
 All right, fine, okay. 
 Can do. Whatever they want. 
 [Sighs] 
 Yeah, and if you have any problems at all ever, you know you can just call me. 
 All right. 
 [Indistinct chatter] 
 Suzi Sasso! 
 Speak of the devil! How are you? 
 Suzi : Dr. James, there you... 
 Oh, I like this! I like that. 
 Oh, thank you. 
 I'm doing well, thank you. Yeah. 
 I just got back from a two-week vacation... 
 Punta Mita, it was off-season rates... 
 Nice. 
 Anyway, I landed here, LAX. 
 I wanted to see you. 
 I wanted to see my territories before I head back to Chattanooga. 
 Well, that's a coincidence, because I wanted to talk to you, too. 
 And I can't forget this. 
 I got that for you. 
 The natives made it there. 
 Do you still call them natives, or they like us, now? 
 I don't know. 
 I tell you what, Do you still cayour numbers look or they like usreal good. 
 Do they? 
 Uh-huh. 
 Because we've been really busy, but there was a little glitch, because Medicaid CMS contacted us. 
 Uh-huh. Is there a, uh... 
 Is there a problem? 
 I don't know. I... 
 Suzi : Have you been red-flagged? 
 Did you overprescribe? 
 Overprescribe? 
 No. I mean, I just did exactly what you told me do to. 
 Well... [chuckles] I don't think any of us expected you to run this fast, this aggressively. 
 Now, I naturally assumed you would gradually phase in... 
 Phase in? No one said anything about phasing in. 
 I mean, you never told me to go slow. 
 Well... Well, wait a minute there. 
 [stammers] 
 No, you wait a minute. All I did was recertify your patients. 
 The one you told me to recertify. 
 Yes. 
 With appropriate metrics, yes. 
 Metrics? 
 Now you're saying... No, nobody said anything about met... 
 Oh God. Oh God. I mean, they looked ill. 
 Oh God, what have you done? 
 Me? I... 
 You said get 'em early, keep 'em longer. 
 No, no, no, no, no. 
 Mm-mm, I never said that. 
 You told... You... 
 You're lying through your teeth! 
 Oh, no. No, no, no, no. 
 I said there are legal and ethical lines that mustn't be crossed. 
 Now listen, you don't screw with a Tri Delt, okay? 
 It sounds like you got greedy! 
 I didn't get gree... 
 Uh-huh. 
 Don't you walk out on me! Suzi. 
 Suzi, you have to help me. Suzi! 
 Mm-mm. 
 You are a problem client, and I'm cutting you loose. 
 Dr. James, I'm not doing nothing, and I'm not saying nothing that's gonna make this any easier for you. 
 Okay, I don't blame you. 
 You let me walk on hot coals and roast on my own spit. 
 I am truly sorry if you feel like you have been taken advantage of. 
 Uh, yeah! So, I don't where you're going with this and... 
 Well, here's the thing. 
 See, I get it, as a woman geriatrician making, what, approximately 65% of what my male counterparts make... 
 What does that have to do with anything? 
 What... I'm on top of this, you know. 
 I am going to investigate how this came to pass, and I'm not accepting anything less than your full remuneration. 
 So you're telling me, you didn't know about it. 
 I didn't know about... How could I possibly have known? 
 Your salary is paid by LBHE Hospice. 
 I need you to bring me all of the admit and recert files, just for a little review. 
 Comfort suites, swing beds, scatter beds. 
 I just need to see our paperwork. 
 Please, if you could? 
 A priority. 
 C-can do? Yes? Thank you. 
 [Moaning] 
 You don't have to take on all my debt. 
 I know it's a lot. 
 I've waited and saved a long time... for a girl like you. 
 [moans] 
 Huh. Where's Dawn? 
 I don't know. 
 Maybe in the back helping Dr. James with Mrs. Poppley. 
 Something up with her? 
 I don't think so. 
 You sure? 
 I don't know. 
 Oh, Didi, God. 
 I know when you're lying to me. 
 I mean, I totally know when you're lying to me. 
 All over your face. Right now. 
 Jenna : Dawn, sorry, I had to page you. 
 It's okay. I was just on my break. 
 There's more going on here than we thought. 
 I found two large sebaceous cysts on her scalp, hidden in her hair. 
 They're enormous. 
 They're as big as goose eggs. 
 Mrs. Poppley, we're going to tackle the cysts on your scalp first. 
 On today, of all days. 
 Oh, Dr. James, look at this, growing behind this ear. 
 What? 
 Oh, good Lord. 
 It's like a cabbage. 
 Mrs. Poppley, your body is a veritable treasure hunt, do you know that? 
 Poppley : Yes. I've been so ashamed of these things for so long. 
 Well, don't you worry about that. 
 We're going to take good care of you. 
 And know that each of them is rather beautiful in their own way, like snowflakes. 
 No, Suzi, no, you don't get off scot-free. 
 You don't just cut usikat. 
 I followed your guidelines to the tee! 
 Hello? Hel... 
 [knocks] Hi, Jenna. 
 Ann, hi! 
 Is everything okay out there? 
 Yeah, yeah. 
 You know, some days are better than others. 
 Well, I was thinking... would you like to come to my place? After work. 
 I'd love to show you my new rock garden. 
 And we could just, you know, take a dip and relax. 
 Oh, relax. Ann, yes. Yes. 
 I could get some manchego and some good bread, or we could just sit in the spa. 
 Oh my God. Ann, that sounds like heaven. 
 Why don't I just stop at my place first, I'll grab my suit. 
 Nah. 
 I mean, if you really think you need one. 
 Nice work, Beverly. 
 
 
 
 [Pager beeps] 
 [rings] 
 Hello? 
 [Pager beeps] 
 Paul, please, they don't know. 
 They don't. Please. 
 I didn't... Please, Paul. 
 Maybe they don't have to... 
 It's too late for that, Jenna. 
 Please. Please. 
 [sighs] 
 At 11:37, the inspector general of Medicare CMS froze our accounts. 
 At 11:43, Medi-Cal Legal tipped us off to the initiation of a racketeering and anti-kickback proceeding brought in California Superior Court. 
 A kickback: "Accepting something of value from the hospice, and then referring patients to the hospice." 
 Who pays Nurse Ortley's salary for Hospice Liaison Nurse? 
 LBHE Hospice. 
 Oh God. 
 Don't you get it? 
 No. 
 If hospice provides a nurse to a hospital for hospice care, the hospital has to pay for that nurse. 
 So, Didi's a kickback... 
 The Qui Tam case, filed under-seal, names all of you as co-conspirators in a pattern of criminal activity. 
 Sir, I am not a criminal. 
 If a Qui Tam case filed under seal says you are, then you are. 
 C-can I ask a question? 
 How can I be the one who was taken advantage of and abused, and still be guilty and innocent at the same time? 
 Well, it would be a mistake, Nurse Ortley, for you to assume anything about your status at this hospital. 
 "Penalties for the anti-kickback statute include $500,000 in criminal fines and five years imprisonment, as we as institutional exclusion from participation in the Medicare and Medicaid programs." 
 Bringing this entire hospital to its knees. 
 Oh! We're going to be coming around to interview each of you separately. 
 Do not destroy anything. 
 That includes email. 
 Do not tamper with records. 
 Do not even discuss this matter amongst yourselves. 
 Dr. James. 
 Dr. James. 
 Excuse me. One second. I didn't do anything, so... 
 You know what? Why are you always worried about your own neck? 
 Dr. James, we really need to talk. 
 Didi : Dr. James, I need my money. 
 Dawn : Why are you so greedy? 
 You give up half your salary and we'll see who's greedy. 
 This is hardly real racketeering, okay? 
 This is like picky stuff. I'm gonna tell you right now, no one is impuning my professional reputation. 
 Dawn : Shut up. Close the blinds. 
 Didi : I'm gonna squeal like a stuck pig. 
 I'm not even debating this, okay? 
 I won the Millicent Schwartzman Award. 
 No one is dragging me into the toilet. 
 Dawn, stop! Be present. 
 Now, I'm not taking this. We've been duped by a bloodthirsty, ruthless hospice agency who seduced me with blandishments and pie-in-the-sky promises. 
 This is about your damned mice. 
 I am so tired of you proclaiming your innocence. 
 Me? 
 Yes, you. You're as guilty as anybody else, 'cause you spent the loot. 
 Your fancy flat-screen TVs, bought with the hospice augmentation money, that you used for your own benefit, so you're just as guilty as me. 
 You're just as greedy as Didi, spending the money that I made... that Didi and I made. 
 No, no, no, no, Dr. James. 
 You had me rubber-stamping forms for you. 
 [Scoffs] You literally had me doing it. 
 There's a rubber stamp in your desk. 
 Show them the rubber stamp. 
 No... Well, okay, who interceded in surgery for poor Mrs. Weller to enroll her in hospice instead? 
 I did no such thing. 
 Oh, so you're gonna tell that to a jury when the acting Head of the Medical Center, Dr. Paul Sckley, is going to testify that you did? 
 No, ma'am. I was only advocating for that woman. 
 Anthou get your sister on the... on the payroll to help you with the hospice. 
 Featherbedding! 
 Oh, I'll bet you're glad you took that position now, huh, Denise? 
 It's a tar pit. 
 [Chuckles] What? I'm not in the tar pit. 
 You were, uh, using that poor girl, the volunteer, and she was a hospice kickback. 
 Uh, Colleen. 
 Dawn : Hardly ever. 
 Constantly. 
 It was only when I was pregnant. 
 Didi : She brought you French toast and bacon three hours ago. 
 Well, I don't trust any of you. 
 I would advise none of you to trust each other, either. 
 And yet, paradoxically, we all have to pitch in and work together. 
 It's like "Treasure of the Sierra Madre". 
 Okay, well I think that, um, some of the files could maybe show some overzealous enrollments and, uh, debatable recertifications, so we're going to tell these good women that they are henceforth ineligible for that extra level of care. 
 We got our titties in a ringer, so we're gonna go out there, we're gonna put on our game faces, and we're gonna wade through this sh1t. 
 You mean Mom's not dying after all? 
 I'm so sorry, Agnes. Not quite fast enough for Medicaid. 
 Dr. James, this is impossible. 
 I mean, all of the nursing homeshave wait lists. 
 You have to deal with that quickly, Dawn. 
 Discharged. 
 I just need your signature right here. 
 Man : She said it was just a bureaucratic snafu. 
 Dr. James, your residents came to say goodbye. 
 Oh, thank you. 
 Uh, your precerts, revised. 
 Revised. Thank you. Good work. Yes. 
 Nurse. You're a stand-up guy. 
 Sometimes it's hard for me to appreciate your qualities, because you have so many layers. 
 I like this room! I don't know what's wrong with me. 
 Why is it taking me so long to die? 
 Where's Birdy Lamb? I've been here over a f*cking hour! 
 Leonard! 
 Birdy. 
 All right, gents. Here we are. 
 Your work with me has come to an end. 
 We've walked a mile in your shoes. 
 It has been fun and a little challenging. 
 Andrew, I hope you take the spirit of Billy Barnes with you. 
 Lois, I hope that you carry a love and respect for geriatrics in your heart. 
 You, when you look back, uh, however you may think of me, remember, I cared. 
 So long. 
 Jenna : Okay, is this all the files? 
 Yeah, this is the last of them. 
 All right. 
 And there's nothing entered on the Mount Palms database? 
 Nothing that I know of. All right. 
 Good. Good deal. 
 Wait sh... Wait, should we get Patsy? 
 No. God, no! 
 I don't trust him entirely. 
 I mean, he's not exactly one of us. 
 [Breathing heavily] Okay, well, what do we do with the files? 
 All right, well... right, like I said, I think that the files may show some evidence that, uh... 
 I mean, if you looked at it aggressively through a distorted lens, you could twist it into maybe building a case that there were some overly generous, uh, admission policies. 
 So, we... have to destroy them. 
 Okay, how? 
 How? 
 Are you two crazy? 
 We take them down to the morgue, we throw them into the incinerator. 
 No. 
 It's a morgue, not a crematorium, and we don't even have ovens. 
 Jenna : f*ck. We can't destroy evidence. 
 I can... I can take them all to my house. 
 My God, that's them. 
 Okay, just look normal. 
 Shove everything under the desk. 
 Yeah, they can see us. I still want all my money. 
 Oh God, Didi. Harping on the money. 
 It's always about money with her. 
 Because I'm always the one getting screwed out of it, Dawn! 
 Here, here. God, I got a big gaping hole in my backyard where my pool is supposed to be. 
 I just want one nice thing. 
 You got cellos and Four Seasons, and, Dr. James, you got everything. 
 Listen to me. There is no more money. 
 Hospice is gone. 
 Suzie Sasso is gone. 
 We're being thrown to the wolves right now. 
 So, if s has high blood pressure, I guess I'd start her off on baby aspirin. 
 I'm Dr. Jenna James. Can we help you? 
 Yeah, we're here for the hospice files. 
 Hospice files? I think we keep those hospice files out... 
 Here. Denise, we keep the hospice files in the supply room. 
 Excuse me, excuse me. What are... 
 What are these? 
 There's nothing in that about... 
 Yeah, that's a hospice... 
 Hmm. 
 [Chattering] 
 [sighs] 
 Man : All right, that's it. 
 Let's get down to Legal. 
 [Wheels squeaking] 
 ♪ ♪ 
 Dennis : Everyone looks tired. 
 Kinda pooped. 
 Let's have some fun. Let's cut this cake. 
 Didi, big piece or little piece? 
 Dennis! What? 
 Dawn : I already told you, we've had a really tough day. 
 Dawn, why don't you show Dennis the sunglasses over there? 
 Why? 
 Hey, Didi. 
 No, let's keep cutting the cake. 
 What's everybody doing? 
 Uh, having a snack. 
 Yeah. What's the cake for? 
 Celebration for some special occasion? 
 Can I get you something? 
 Yeah, I think I'll take some Sucrets. 
 You know what? Actually, I'd like some chips, too. 
 What's going on, Dawn? 
 I got married. 
 Did you? 
 To Dennis. 
 Hi! 
 Really? 
 Dennis : Hi! 
 Yeah. On Saturday. 
 Dennis : Would you like a piece of cake, Nurse de la Serda? 
 Just the chips and Sucrets, please. 
 Darling, would you like a rose? 
 Cash or charge? 
 You know what? 
 Actually, I'd like to use my debit card. 
 Dennis : A rose for my rose. 
 What is that look? 
 What look? 
 That smirk. I don't know what you're talking about. 
 Congratulations on your rebound marriage, by the way. 
 Oh, is that what you think this is? 
 After everything we have been through today, don't start it. 
 Patsy : In other words, I knew that that whole Haiti business was complete f*cking bullshit. 
 Oh, I'd love that rose now, honey. 
 I'd love this tub of lip balm. 
 I'll be taking it with me to Turnips tonight. 
 You know, it just so happens that Dennis completely supports me and my desire to serve in Haiti. 
 We went to a deep place, Dawn. 
 You can't just leave a deep place as easily as you think. 
 And he's a step down. Okay, in order for some closure, we're gonna need some time. 
 Neither of us has ever felt so deeply and intensely before. 
 Honey, is everything okay over here? 
 Fine. 
 [Whispers] We had completely come to the end of our road. 
 No, we were not. We were just having a lull. Mmm! It was over. 
 Having a lull. Are you even sexually attracted to me? 
 God. 
 And don't lie to me. 
 Yeah, parts of you. 
 Like what part? 
 The top part. 
 You like my top part? 
 Yeah. 
 What about my bottom? 
 [Sighs] My bottom back? 
 My botfront? 
 [Whispers] Dawn! If I spread my legs, does that turn you on? 
 [Sighs] Okay, so you like my top and you like my bottom back. 
 [Whispers] Yes. I like it a lot. 
 Didi : Dawn! Get over here. 
 [Whispers] What the f*ck? 
 I will slap your face off. 
 Did you see that, though They both want me. 
 I mean, they want different parts. 
 He wants the front, and he wants the back. 
 [Men grunting] Oh my God! 
 Will you two knock it off! 
 Dawn! Come on. 
 Stop it! 
 Patsy : Dawn! sh1t. Dawn! 
 Jenna : I'm not that person. 
 I'm not Dr. Death. 
 I'm not Dr. Death. I'm not Doct... 
 [breathes deeply] Dr. Death. 
 I'm not. I'm not. 
 Where do you think you are going? 
 Dr. James. 
 Dr. James? 
 Didi : Dawn. Dawn. 
 Dawn! 
 Jenna : Go away! Leave me alone! 
 [Grunts] 
 Didi : What are we doing? 
 Dawn : Dr. James! 
 Didi : Dawn! Come on! 
 [Panting] 
 sh1t. 
 [Door closes] 
 What? What do you want? 
 Are you okay? 
 We could all join hands and run over the edge. 
 Could just jump off and fly away. 
 I used to dream that as a little girl, that I could fly by pedaling my feet and flapping my arms. 
 Except there was always that magnet thing that would slow you down, suck you back down to the bad guys. 
 What do you suppose that pipe is? 
 That's the pipe that lets all of the souls out in the end to be free. 
 [Door opens] [panting] 
 Mrs. Lee is dying. 
 If I have made a mistake in the direction of this ward, if I have erred... 
 I sincerely apologize. 
 I never meant to jeopardize you or your careers. 
 [Heart monitor beeping] 
 Dawn : It's hard to watch, DNR. 
 [Flatline] Her heart stopped beating. 
 She's still breathing. 
 The breathing will end soon. 
 [Breathing] 
 No pulse. No blood pressure. 
 Didi : But still breathing. 
 Her spirit... is... hovering. 
 It's half dead, half alive. 
 She doesn't know if she wants to go. 
 Ruth? 
 [Breathes shakily] 
 You're deciding, aren't you? 
 Whether to go or stay, whether it's worth it? 
 Ruth. 
 She's decided. This one's coming back. 
 Dr. James, we can't do any extraordinary intervention. Mm-hmm. 
 Why not? Work her legs. 
 Get the IV going again. 
 A warm blanket. 
 We're bring you back, Ruth. 
 Is that all right with you? 
 [Heart monitor beeping] 
 It's okay. You're back... with us. Her heart's beating. 
 Jenna : Keep the blood moving. 
 What are you doing? 
 Rubbing her ears, Dawn. It feels nice. 
 We've got you, Ruth. Yes. 
 Mom.
