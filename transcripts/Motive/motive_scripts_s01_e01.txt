 Evening, Detective Flynn. 
 Uh, morning, actually, Dave. 
 Ident handed over the scene yet? 
 They're almost finished. 
 Coroner's on her way down. 
 Thanks. 
 Your baby still waking up at night? 
 Huh? 
 You look like hell. 
 Keep 'em off the grass, huh? 
 I didn't know that was part of this scene. 
 It's not. It's just nice grass. 
 Nothing says Friday night like a homicide. 
 I don't know why I bother making plans. 
 It's like I'm tempting fate. 
 Oh, so you did this, it's your fault. 
 You owe me concert tickets. 
 Consider it done. 
 So... "The creeper," does that mean anything to you? 
 Yeah. 
 A killer who wants a name, always a bad sign. 
 Where's the victim? 
 Upstairs. 
 High school teacher named Glenn Martin. 
 Blunt force head injuries. 
 His wife found him next to their bed. 
 Where was she? 
 Sleeping in the spare room. 
 Or so she says. 
 What? 
 It happens. 
 Yeah, it happens. You know the stats. 
 Numbers can lie. 
 So can people. 
 Ange? Angie? 
 No, no, no, I wouldn't touch that. 
 There's a dog inhibiting access to the body. 
 It won't budge, not even for the wife. 
 Hey, guys, we got a murder scene growing cold, and a killer running loose? 
 It's a big dog, Angie. [Dog barking] 
 It's all right. I got a way with animals. 
 I thought you had a way with men. 
 Same principles apply. You've just got to take control. 
 Good luck. 
 Sit. 
 [Barking and growling] 
 I said, sit! 
 [Barking and growling] 
 If you don't sit, right now... taking control, huh? 
 Usually takes a couple dates. 
 Animal control's on the way. 
 In the meantime, I think I saw a coffee shop on the corner. 
 Hey, if you're going, I'll take a mocha... 
 [Breathing hard] 
 [shutter clicking] 
 Thank you for being so patient, Mrs. Martin. 
 We're almost finished. 
 Make sure to get her hands, please. 
 So what subject did Glenn teach? 
 Uh, science. 
 That's a hard one, all those charts and tables. 
 Glenn wrote these crazy songs for his kids, to help them remember. 
 So he was a singing scientist? 
 He must have been a hit. 
 People loved being around him. 
 Why would anyone... 
 Why would... okay, we're good. 
 Thank you, Mrs. Martin. 
 Linda, I need your robe and nightgown as evidence. 
 Just a formality. 
 Okay. 
 Thank you. 
 I need to stay in the room. 
 Protocol. 
 Oh. 
 There we go. 
 For God's sake, Glenn. 
 How long does it take to walk a dog? 
 I stopped by the lamplighter. 
 Don't tell me you were singing again. 
 Can we talk? 
 You're drunk. 
 [Stammers and chuckles] 
 A little. 
 I mean, doesn't mean we can't talk. 
 Might even make it easier. 
 I told you, everything's fine. 
 It doesn't feel that way. 
 We'll talk in the morning, Glenn. 
 Go upstairs, sleep it off. 
 [Swell of cheering crowd] 
 Nothing like the smell of sweaty polyester on a Friday night. 
 Sorry? 
 I don't speak loser. 
 How long are you gonna be? 
 I just gotta change. 
 Band geeks in their natural habitat. 
 Girl : Hey, guys, come over. 
 I'm going to take... 
 I want to take a picture. 
 Kristi, huh? 
 She's all right for a drum major. 
 Her? 
 She doesn't even know I exist. 
 [Laughing] 
 Let's get out of here. 
 It's time for the creepers. 
 Shut up. 
 What? 
 Nobody's paying attention. 
 Exactly, and that's the way I like it. 
 We're ghosts. 
 Get the car. 
 Okay. 
 Say... cheese! 
 Dude, Woodbridge park? 
 Yeah? So? 
 So you told me the first rule of creeping is to avoid areas where people know you. 
 Those were the beginner rules. 
 Cell phones on silent. 
 I wanna smoke some green first. 
 I know you got a fattie in your backpack. 
 Dude, did you forget your backpack? 
 Dammit, Willie! 
 Creeping isn't a game. 
 If you wanna get stoned, go hang out with your stoner friends. 
 It was just a suggestion, okay? 
 Relax. 
 Coroner : Good morning, boys. 
 Officer : Good morning, doctor. 
 Looking sharp. 
 Hello. 
 Medical examiner. 
 They told me you have a body, and I see that they were right. 
 Victim's inside, Dr. Rogers. 
 Hmm. 
 What time did Mr. Martin come home? 
 Um... 10:00? 
 Sometimes with Glenn, one beer would turn into four, and... 
 He was snoring before his head hit the pillow, which usually happens when he has too much to drink. 
 I'm guessing that's why you went to the spare room? 
 Yeah. 
 That's right. To get some sleep. 
 What woke you up? 
 Glenn, he was yelling at someone. 
 I... got out of bed and ran upstairs as fast as I could, but by the time I made it up there, he... 
 He... 
 It's okay. 
 Take your time. 
 I couldn't help but notice the excessive blood on your arms and your hands. 
 When I saw Glenn on the floor, I went to him and I held him. 
 He was my husband. 
 You think that I did that in there? 
 No, Detective Vega didn't mean to suggest that. 
 Did you see anyone coming down the stairs? 
 No. 
 How well did the first responders search the house? 
 [Teens chuckle] 
 Yo, check out this molester van. 
 Shag carpet? 
 Wood paneling? Mm! 
 Where can I get one? 
 This house looks good. 
 We'll hit this one tonight. 
 Vega : Listen up, people, we're going to do a more thorough search of the house. 
 Let's go! 
 This way! 
 Sergeant, teams of three! 
 Basement, main floor, upstairs. 
 Time's ticking, people. 
 Come on, let's find this guy! 
 Top to bottom, you guys. 
 There may be a killer in the house. 
 [Officers below] All the way downstairs. 
 Over here. 
 No, it's clear. 
 Hey, anybody got a key to this trunk? 
 Yeah, we need to get this open. 
 [Grunting with effort] 
 Basement's clear! 
 Main floor's clear! 
 Vega : Upstairs is clear, too. 
 I'm telling you, the wife's looking guilty. 
 She didn't kill her husband. 
 Come on, ange, she reported the body, and they were alone in the house. 
 So, what are you saying, she knocked off her hubby and scrawled something on the wall to throw us off? 
 Yeah, why not? 
 No, she is hiding something, but she didn't kill her husband. 
 Oh, let me guess, you can feel her pain? 
 No. 
 Okay, yes. 
 When she was talking about how everyone loves him, I could see the warmth in her eyes. 
 You could see that. 
 No, no. All I saw was the blood all over her. 
 From hugging her dead husband in a fit of grief. 
 Which she did to cover the spray when she bludgeoned him to death? 
 Such a romantic. And still single? 
 You know, Angie, all I'm saying, maybe it's time we start embracing the facts and not rejecting the obvious. 
 I am not saying that the marriage was great. 
 But look at this, she cut the crusts off his sandwiches. 
 My kid doesn't even get lunch money. 
 Detective Vega? 
 Yeah. 
 I examined all points of entry like you requested. 
 No signs of forced entry, upstairs or down. 
 Just saying. 
 Tell me something, Lucas, can you feel a woman's pain? 
 Intensely. 
 Wow. 
 What else you got? 
 No objects of value in the house appear to be missing. 
 Soda bottle was knocked over on the counter. 
 I've bagged that for evidence. 
 Nothing else appears out of place. 
 Well, evidence seems to say that no one else was in the house, and when the evidence speaks, Angie, I listen. 
 So what did the wife do with the murder weapon? 
 Exactly. 
 Check and see if you can find any other incident reports with the creeper. 
 Maybe this wasn't his first night out. 
 [Gasps of passion from spare room] 
 [Whispering] Dude, dude, dude... 
 Somebody's making the beast with two backs. 
 Let's find another house. 
 No, this one's perfect. 
 But they're still awake. 
 This is what creeping's all about. 
 Make yourself invisible. 
 Fine, let's just find a souvenir and go. 
 [Couple grunting and moaning with passion] 
 Willie, whispering : Come on, grab something and let's go. 
 Dude, that hula girl is perfect. 
 I don't want that. 
 Shopping for something specific? 
 'Cause I can drive you to the mall... 
 [couple chatting and giggling] 
 Man : Thank you for the phone call. 
 I hope to see you soon. 
 [Laughing] 
 That was so close! 
 Oh, man, who was that guy? 
 Who was that guy doing Borat? 
 In heavy accent : "Thank you for phone call." 
 Come on, man, let's get stoned. 
 I know a guy who sells the chronic. 
 Not for me. I'm out. 
 I'm out. 
 Okay, dude. 
 You're going home now? 
 For someone who likes to live on the edge, you can be a total buzzkill. 
 "Thank you for phone call." 
 Coroner : We've got blunt-force trauma to the head. 
 No contusions on the neck. 
 No apparent defensive wounds to the hands. 
 The victim might not have seen his attacker coming in the dark. 
 Or he saw his attacker and knew her. 
 Hmm, it's a possibility. 
 Ange : We know he saw his attacker. 
 She heard them fighting... so she says. 
 So, the two of you are fighting again? 
 We're discussing. 
 Yeah. That's what my second husband called it, too. 
 [Chuckles wryly] 
 Vega : Do you have a time of death? 
 Lividity suggests he sprouted wings about two or three hours ago. 
 So midnight. 
 Hmm. Ish. 
 I'll know for sure when I get him back to the lab. 
 Hey, didn't Lucas say nothing of value was missing from the house? 
 He did. 
 Come check this out. 
 Yeah, I wouldn't exactly classify a bowling trophy as an object of value. 
 You would if you won it. 
 Or if you used it as a weapon. 
 [Snoring gently] 
 Easy, boy. 
 Hey, buddy. 
 That's a good boy. 
 That's a good dog. 
 You stay. 
 [Snoring softly] 
 Glenn, sleepily : Tom? 
 Is that you? 
 What are you doing here? 
 Tom, wait! 
 Let me go! 
 I'm calling the police! 
 Glenn? 
 [Dog barking] 
 Glenn? 
 Okay, so Glenn gets out of bed to confront the killer, who ostensibly has the trophy, and whack, right? 
 Right. 
 Why? 
 Before the lethal blow, the victim's wife hears him shouting from the spare room downstairs. 
 So she says. 
 Or so she says. 
 She comes rushing up the stairs to check on her husband. 
 But how'd the killer get away? 
 Not down the stairs. He would've ran into the wife. 
 [Muttering] So where'd he go? 
 I don't know, but Lucas is right. 
 These windows are locked. 
 [Whispers] Hey, Lucas. 
 Get a ladder. Get a ladder. 
 [Whispering] Do you have a flashlight? 
 [Dime clatters] 
 All clear. 
 I've got a puddle up here that's fresh and wet. 
 Looks like he went out through the vent. 
 Expand the perimeter and lock it down. 
 We're searching everywhere. 
 [Officers shout] 
 I want a man on either side of the alley! 
 You two, let's go! 
 If he used the trophy as the weapon, it was a crime of opportunity. 
 He didn't come here armed to kill. 
 Well, he was discovered and panicked. 
 And pees his pants? 
 Either from nerves, or one too many big gulps. 
 Either way, we're dealing with a professional here. 
 Frank. 
 Detective, the yard turned up nothing. 
 [Shutter clicks] 
 Hey... 
 Who hides in closets? 
 Killers. 
 And lovers. 
 Come on. 
 What did you win? 
 None of your business, Lulu. 
 Go back to sleep. 
 What's all over it? 
 Just dirt. Go to bed. 
 I'm telling mom and dad that you woke me up. 
 If you tell mom and dad anything, you're dead. 
 [Clears throat loudly] 
 Hey, mom. 
 I thought you were at work. 
 Clearly. 
 Hey, Mrs. Flynn. 
 Crystal, put your top on. 
 Are those real? 
 Nope. I got 'em for my birthday. 
 You wanna see? 
 No. 
 Maybe. How much did they cost? 
 Never mind. Go in. 
 Do your parents know you're here? 
 They know I'm at a friend's. 
 House rules, dude. 
 You want pancakes? 
 Are you having s*x? 
 [Scoffs] 
 For chrissakes... 
 Are you... okay, okay, okay. 
 Take two. 
 How was your evening, son? 
 I would've taken her home, but you had the car. 
 Uh, yeah, that's 'cause I'm the one with the job. 
 If I had my own wheels... 
 Oh, please. And I won the lottery. 
 Plus, I'm not the one who had two speeding tickets in the last three months in a car owned by a cop. 
 In that car? 
 It's kind of hard not to put pedal to the metal. 
 Well, maybe we can work something out. 
 In the meantime, you promised me pancakes. 
 Can, uh... 
 Crystal stay for breakfast? 
 Can her boobs make coffee? 
 Woman : No, no, no. I can't do it today. 
 I'm going skating with Willie. 
 I've just got to get the dog in the car. 
 Hold on. [Barking] 
 Be back late. 
 Okay, honey. Don't forget to buy your sister a birthday present. 
 
 
 
 Thanks for coming in, Linda. 
 We just need a little more information on your relationship with Arman Pozner. 
 How do you know about arman? 
 We checked your bank records, and you wrote a check to him just two days ago for $2,000. 
 We work together at sears. 
 He needed a down payment for a van. 
 He just moved here from chechnya. 
 I'd never lend you more than five bucks. 
 I'm well aware. 
 Unless he's more than a co-worker? 
 I've been sleeping with him. 
 Mm-hmm. 
 I guess that would account for the phone call to his house last night? 
 I invited arman over after Glenn passed out, but he had nothing to do with this. 
 He was long gone before I went to bed. 
 So you two had s*x while your husband was in the house? 
 Glenn's more like a roommate now. 
 Do you think that you maybe wanted the roommate out, and the Russian in? 
 For the last time, I loved my husband. 
 We had a comfortable life. 
 Now he's gone. 
 And I... 
 Dammit, Glenn. 
 [Crying] 
 If you're going to rage, you should aim a little higher than a band geek party, friendo. 
 All right, we party here with the band, but we go creeping afterwards. 
 I lost my gloves last night. 
 Good. 
 Those things were so emo. 
 Better than leaving fingerprints. 
 I don't care about fingerprints. 
 We're minors. 
 What are they going to do if they catch us? 
 Put us in counselling? 
 [Laughing] 
 Very festive. 
 What's going on? 
 You didn't hear? 
 Mr. Martin's dead. 
 Killed last night. 
 The teacher who raps? Tragic. 
 So where's the keg? 
 [Sighing heavily] 
 [Blows thudding] 
 Hey, tom. 
 I'm glad you came. 
 Hey, kristi. 
 It's weird about Mr. Martin, hey? 
 Yeah, I can't believe what happened. 
 I heard his head was crushed. 
 Hey... 
 It's all right. 
 I want it all to go away. 
 I want him to be alive. 
 All right, dream team, where are my leads? 
 Good afternoon to you, too, sir. 
 Yeah, yeah. 
 What gives with the Russian boyfriend? 
 He alibi'd out for the time of the murder. 
 Turns out Mrs. Martin wasn't the only bored housewife he was servicing. 
 Lucas! 
 You get the analyzed evidence from forensics? 
 Yes, sir. 
 They had no luck pulling a DNA profile from the urine. 
 Did you know healthy individuals don't emit epithelials in their urine? 
 Now, if we had semen traces, they'd be bang on... move on, Lucas. 
 That's the bad news. 
 The good news is... there's no good or bad news in homicide, just news. 
 The news is that the partial prints at the crime scene match prints from a series of incidents. 
 The intruder looks for unlocked doors, windows, and he leaves a signature. 
 You talk to the guys in robbery? 
 There's no leads, but they believe that "the creeper" just breaks in for the thrill, to steal tchotchkes. 
 Somebody needs a girlfriend. 
 Come again? 
 Well, we're looking for someone who's bored. 
 Likes to test authority. 
 Thinks the rules don't apply to them... 
 Starting to sound like someone I know. 
 I think the creeper's a teenager. 
 We're looking for a teenager. 
 Lucas : I checked through the victim's students for the last three years. 
 I found two with juvenile records. 
 You contact the suspects? 
 I spoke to Murphy there. 
 He has an alibi from midnight on. 
 I've never been to an autopsy before. 
 Always happy to be somebody's first. 
 You gonna be okay? 
 Yeah. 
 See these indentations here? 
 All right angles. 
 Amazing. 
 You're weird. 
 I like that. 
 All right, Murphy here has an alibi. 
 What about the other guy? Where was he? 
 James Anthony? 
 His parents say that he's at a party right now. 
 I have an address. 
 Look at this. 
 Oh, man, this brings back memories. 
 Under-age drinking and raging hormones? 
 Classic combo. 
 [Chuckles] 
 Hey... 
 Where do I find James Anthony? 
 Uh... I think he's out by the pool. 
 Thanks. 
 Detective Angie Flynn. 
 We're looking for a student who goes to your high school. 
 Yeah, where do we find James Anthony? 
 Uh, down by the fire pit. 
 Great. 
 Don't worry, I'm not going to card you. 
 Hmm? 
 Well, you just seem a little nervous. 
 [Sighs] 
 Yeah, it's just... 
 With all the Mr. Martin stuff going on, you know. 
 Yeah, terrible, wasn't it? 
 Did you have a class with him? 
 No. 
 But you sound like you knew him. 
 Just from the park. 
 We used to run our dogs together sometimes. 
 You know anyone who'd want to hurt him? 
 No. 
 Everybody loved Mr. Martin. 
 Really? 'Cause usually teachers are such dorks, right? 
 But Mr. Martin sounds cool, huh? 
 Like I said, he wasn't my teacher. 
 Well, if you think of anything that could help us, let us know. 
 My parents are gonna freak out when they find the cops have been here. 
 Tv reporter :  ...By all his students Glenn Martin, local high school teacher,  was found murdered in his home. 
 Police are looking for witnesses, and crimestoppers is offering a reward for any information that leads to an arrest... 
 Hey! 
 Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! 
 You were, uh, you were asking about Mr. Martin's murder? 
 Yeah, you know anything? 
 I, um, I was at the park that night. 
 I saw a black van near Mr. Martin's house. 
 Very suspicious. 
 A Russian was behind the wheel. 
 And how could you tell he was Russian? 
 I don't know. He looked Russian. 
 What were doing at the park so late? 
 Just hanging out. 
 Doing what? 
 What difference does it make? 
 It'd be great if you could just answer the question. 
 [Laughs nervously] 
 Whoa, ease off the pedal, man. 
 I-I'm only trying to be helpful. 
 So, uh, do I get any money for this? 
 Well, it depends on how good your information is. 
 Have you ever heard of creeping? 
 Naw. 
 No, that's all I got. 
 Um, I should go now, get back to the party. 
 Hey, wait, wait, wait. 
 Here, do me a favour. 
 You just, uh, write your name and number on the back of that, for the reward. 
 Yeah. Reward... 
 Thanks, Willie. 
 You have a good night. 
 Yeah. You, too. 
 Thank you. 
 Little liar. 
 He knew what creeping is, and he was a lot closer than the park. 
 I'll run these. 
 And then compare them to the partials and the handwriting we found at the crime scene. 
 Seriously? 
 Just checking. 
 What the hell were you doing? 
 Dude, I saw this news report, and I'm like, "that's Mr. Martin's house!" 
 We were there the night the deed was done. 
 And you talked to the cops? 
 I know. 
 They're looking for witnesses. 
 You remember that black van we saw? 
 And the Russian guy? 
 I don't, and neither do you. 
 But we could be, like, the key to the whole situation! 
 Did you mention me? 
 No, but if I get a reward, I'll split it with you. 
 You idiot! 
 We broke into his house. We committed a crime. 
 Duh! I left that part out. 
 Come on, man, we could catch a killer. 
 I'm not going to jail for you, do you hear me? 
 What's wrong with you, man? There's a psycho out there. 
 I wasn't there. Remember? 
 I'm invisible. 
 Dude... 
 [Scoffing awkwardly] 
 Something's wrong with you, man. 
 Hi, son. 
 Hey. 
 Have a seat. 
 These detectives want to talk to you. 
 Hi again. 
 Willie schubert was at Woodbridge park on the night Mr. Martin was killed, and we asked around, and we found out that you two are pretty tight. 
 Tom? 
 Were you with Willie? 
 No, I came straight home after the game, remember? 
 He always comes right home. 
 Willie's your best friend. 
 He tell you anything that could help us? 
 [Kids giggling] 
 Son, it's okay. 
 If you know something, you need to tell the police. 
 You seemed a little anxious the other day at the party. 
 Anything you want to tell us? 
 Willie was in Mr. Martin's house the night he got killed. 
 He was creeping. 
 What's creeping? 
 It's something Willie does. 
 He, uh, sneaks into houses and steals souvenirs. 
 [Sighing] 
 I think Willie killed Mr. Martin. 
 [Backpack rustling] 
 [Knocking on door] 
 Good morning, ma'am. 
 We're looking for your son, William. 
 We have a warrant to search the house. 
 [Handcuffs snap shut] 
 I already know what you're going to say. 
 If I could just get that kid alone... 
 Without his lawyer? 
 Willie's a minor. 
 Yeah, but he wants to talk to me. You saw him. 
 I saw him. 
 He's scared. 
 He should be. 
 We've got his handwriting and prints at the scene and the murder weapon under his bed. 
 I'm not denying that he was there. 
 I just, I don't think he's our killer. 
 He has no motive, and with no motive, it makes no sense. 
 Why would Willie bludgeon one of his teachers to death? 
 Your shift's over, Detective. 
 You did a good job. 
 Go home. 
 What do you think? 
 Well, I think you think that it isn't over. 
 You're right. 
 Feels like it is, ange. 
 What, so now you're with Boyd? 
 Just saying there's a lot of evidence, right? 
 Maybe too much? 
 You off? 
 Yeah, Manny's waiting for me. I'm gonna go be a mom. 
 Have fun. 
 Where's Lucas? 
 I don't know, processing? 
 If you find him, have him call me, okay? 
 Will do. 
 [Engines revving] 
 Okay, you ready? 
 I'm ready. 
 And after this, there's no more speeding tickets. 
 You're going to get this out of your system, yeah? 
 Deal. 
 It's exciting. 
 You're gonna win. 
 Make me proud! 
 [Engines roaring] 
 Pardon me. 
 [Barking ferociously] 
 Excuse me. 
 Arrest file, as requested. 
 [Tires squealing] 
 Willie's a stoner, not a murderer. 
 This is just wrong. This kid's innocent. 
 Hey, take a seat. Manny's up next. 
 Are you sure this is good for your son? 
 There's some questionable characters in this crowd. 
 They just have a different sense of style than you, Lucas. 
 Don't be fooled by what you see. 
 [Dog barking ferociously] 
 Or by what you don't see. 
 You lost me. 
 That dog was in the house. 
 Why didn't he attack the killer the way he attacked me? 
 [Tires squealing] 
 Come on, baby! Come on, Manny! 
 Why didn't the dog attack the killer? 
 I don't know! Why didn't he? 
 [Tires squealing] 
 Go! Go! Go! Go! Go, go, go! 
 Yeah! 
 That's my boy! 
 Hey! Come on, boy! 
 Come on, buddy! 
 Come on! 
 Hey, skipper! 
 Hey, skipper, how you doing? 
 Come here. 
 Hey... 
 How you doing, buddy? 
 That dog likes you. 
 When I went into the Martin house, he was ready to tear out my throat. 
 But you, he likes. 
 I've known him a long time. 
 That's why he didn't bark and wake anyone up when you broke into their house, isn't it? 
 I took this photo at the crime scene. 
 You lied to us. 
 You were there that night. 
 Do you want to tell me what happened? 
 Why did you kill Mr. Martin? 
 You left it at the park. 
 How did you know it was mine? 
 I checked inside for an ID. 
 It's not my marijuana. 
 It's not the drugs I'm worried about. 
 You went through my stuff? 
 That's my journal. 
 It reads more like a manifesto. 
 Tom... 
 You're holding onto a lot of hatred inside. 
 That's private. 
 No one's supposed to read that. 
 I wasn't going to do any of those things. 
 You're not alone. 
 When I was your age, I felt like an outsider, too. 
 Give it to me. 
 [Sighs] 
 I'll make you a deal. 
 We'll keep this between the two of us for now. 
 You agree to bring this to a counsellor, I'll throw away the weed. 
 If you don't, I'm turning them both over to the police. 
 I'll give you till Monday to think about it. 
 Till then, I'll keep it with me. 
 [Sleepily] Tom? 
 What are you doing here? 
 You broke into my house? 
 What are you doing here? 
 Stop! 
 Let me go! 
 Tom, this has gone too far! 
 Let me go! 
 I'm calling the police. 
 No! 
 [Dials two numbers] Wait! 
 [Blows thudding heavily] 
 Tom : I didn't mean to kill him. 
 I just wanted back what was mine. Glenn! [Running footsteps approach] Glenn! I want to know why, tom. You don't have to answer that. That's true, but I want to understand. Why take a man's life? When Mr. Martin woke up, the worst you were guilty of was break and enter. They would have given you probation. But I wouldn't be invisible anymore. I like to be invisible. [Tom's mother sobs] ♪ [Clicks pen] Where that kid's going, he's going to wish he was invisible. That kid needs help. Most of them do. Not all of them. Hey, baby, you did so well today. Thanks. I know. You should have seen him. Are you going to see crystal later? Maybe. You want these? Are you messing with me? Yes. Always. You be safe, okay? Have fun. Yeah. So, I'm with you. Yeah, no, I noticed. I was going to head to the gym. You can call it what it is. Tough guys do pilates, too, you know. We could get ribs. Like I have a choice? Well, it's on the way. All right, but don't even think of asking to drive, though. Why? I'll be gentle. No, you won't. [Laughing] No, I won't.
