 This is pure life. 
 It's pure energy, with all its enzymes and nutrients still intact. 
 Cooked food erodes your natural ability to fight infection and disease, but raw food is so rich in fiber and nutrients, and vitamins and all that good stuff, it actually gives to your body. 
 Doesn't that sound better? 
 Bottoms up. 
 [Sighs] 
 Can you feel that? 
 That is your body saying thank you. 
 And this is me saying thank you. 
 Empower yourself, from the inside out. 
 Here's to life. 
 [Applause] 
 Thanks. I can get the rest. 
 You sure? 
 I can stay and help. 
 Um... 
 Well, no, I'm sure you have a lot of other things to do. 
 Sure. 
 Just shout if you need me. 
 ♪ 
 So we watched a zombie movie tonight. 
 What did you do with your Saturday night? 
 Like the song says, "another Saturday night." 
 Lucky. 
 What did you do and with who? 
 You don't know the song, do you? 
 I do so. 
 Sing it. 
 [Humming] ♪ ...Saturday night ♪ 
 Yeah, no, that's so not the song. 
 Your infatuation with my personal life is borderline unhealthy. 
 Hey, Lucas, what do we got? 
 Alarm company notified the police of a break-in at 10:01 P.M. 
 Arrived on the scene 10:23 P.M. 
 Smashed basement window appears to be the point of entry. 
 Anything stolen? 
 Haven't been able to determine that yet. 
 Things around the house have been ruffled, but all the big ticket items have been accounted for... 
 Ruffled? 
 Is that the official term for it? 
 The house appears to have been searched. 
 You mean "ruffled?" 
 Okay. 
 The killer covered a lot of ground in 20 minutes. 
 It could have been more than one person, right? 
 Ask forensics to print as much of the house as possible. 
 Who's the victim? 
 Jack Bergin, 43. 
 Angie : Huh, I'm not seeing any blood in the water. 
 What's the cause of death? 
 It could have been the water itself. 
 95% of all hot tubs contain fecal matter. 
 It's true, it's a bouquet of bacteria. 
 You make that sound appealing. 
 Can't give you a definitive C.O.D. until I get him back to the morgue. 
 Are you sure it's a homicide? 
 Quite sure. 
 Look here. 
 Prong marks from a stun gun. 
 Wow, to kill with that takes determination. 
 You've got to hold the trigger down for a long time. 
 A break and enter with a stun gun, that's new.

 It's charcoal. 
 That's a nice clean print. 
 Thanks. 
 What's wrong with this kitchen? 
 There's no microwave. 
 Wow. 
 You got a vitamix, a dehydrator. 
 Wheatgrass... 
 I'm impressed, Angie. 
 What, I eat healthy sometimes. 
 What did you have for dinner? 
 Waffles. 
 Jack Bergin is the founder of "Eating For Life," a very popular food program here that espouses the benefits of eating raw food. 
 City Magazine called him an organic food guru. 
 What, did you write his Wikipedia page? 
 No, it's right here in his bio. 
 The wife's here. 
 Thanks. 
 This is my house. 
 No, I have a right to know what's happening! 
 Where is my husband? 
 Ms. Bergin? 
 I'm Detective Flynn. 
 Did you spend the evening out? 
 Yeah, at the ballet. Where's Jack? 
 There has been an incident. 
 There was a break-in. 
 Where is he? 
 I'm-I'm very sorry to tell you, he was found dead inside. 
 [Stammering] How? 
 I can't give you any more details right now. 
 Okay, okay... 
 Is there anyone we can call for you? 
 No. 
 There's no one. 
 All right. 
 Take some deep breaths. 
 Who would do this? 
 It's very bright, even in the winter. 
 It's nowhere near my price range. 
 I was just looking at a place down the street, and thought I would just take a peek. 
 It's an impressive property. 
 Four bedrooms. 
 Three full and one half bath. 
 Fireplace. 
 Voice fading : The owners are very motivated to sell... 
 When are you going to turn off all these lights? 
 We're working as fast as we can, Mr. Victor, but we don't want to cut any corners. 
 Did you know Mr. Bergin well? 
 Would you say he was a good neighbour? 
 Well, he kept to himself, when he was home, except his work crew parked in front of my house for the better part of three weeks last year and destroyed all my grass. 
 I told him, resident parking only. 
 Okay. Is there anything else you want us to know? 
 Well, the Johnsons had a break-in this summer. 
 The Johnsons? 
 Three houses down. 
 They went away on vacation, didn't cancel their newspaper. 
 Well, thank you very much, Mr. Victor. 
 You are a vigilant neighbour. 
 Thank you. 
 Hey, look, while you're here, could you deal with all the illegal parking on this street? 
 I take photos of them. 
 It's worth a shot. 
 Absolutely, we will, mm-hmm. 
 I've got three boxes full in the house. 
 I'll be right back. 
 Lucas! 
 That man is getting something for you. 
 "Vigilant?" 
 Yeah, by that I mean retired and bored. 
 "A very vigilant neighbour..." 
 [Chuckling] Hey, I'm glad I'm not the only one who's running behind. 
 Yeah, it feels like I'm late every week. 
 Hey, where's your set of knives? 
 Oh, I knew I didn't read that email well enough. 
 It is my first cooking class. 
 [Laughing] 
 That's all right, you can share with me. 
 You know, I'm always by myself anyway. 
 That's so sweet of you. 
 I'm Lila. 
 Chloe. 
 You know, my husband's on the crusaders' board. 
 No way! 
 It's such a great charity. 
 I donate every year. 
 Yeah, the wristbands have been great for fundraising. 
 What kind of a week did you have? 
 Pretty good. 
 Better than last week. 
 Good. 
 You want to tell me about it? 
 No, actually. 
 I've been, uh, thinking, and I feel like I'm ready to, um, to end our relationship, you and I. 
 Why? What's happened? 
 Nothing happened. 
 I just, I'm ready. 
 Don't throw away the progress we've made over the years. 
 I'm not sure you're ready to just stop treatment. 
 It's okay. 
 I'm... 
 I'm ready to accept things the way they are. 
 I'm ready to move on. 
 I strongly urge you to reconsider. 
 I have... 
 I made up my mind. 
 Very well. 
 But if things start to unravel, know that I'm here if you need me. 
 [Quietly] Thank you. 
 Thank you for everything. 
 So did the stun gun kill him? 
 Coroner : Oh, it killed him. 
 Ventricular arrhythmias led to the myocardial infarction that caused cardiac arrest. 
 You know, we can't really investigate a heart attack. 
 Yeah, that's where it gets kind of complicated. 
 You see, I can't scientifically determine whether or not the electric shock caused the myocardial infarction. 
 But you've got the prong marks. 
 Yeah, and they were definitely from the night of the murder. 
 There's not even any healing. 
 Are you okay? 
 I am. 
 Any chance his death was an accident? 
 Absolutely not. 
 He was electrocuted, with a sustained charge, until he was dead. 
 So definitely murder. 
 Yup. Yeah, oh, yeah. 
 And he's got bruising up and down his arms and back from thrashing about in the tub. 
 Do you have an estimated time of death? 
 Well, the hot water makes the T.O.D. kind of squishy... 
 But I'm gonna say between 6:00 and 10:23 last night. 
 What is that? 
 Is that a lion? 
 King of the jungle, huh? 
 Empower yourself, from the inside out. 
 Here's to life. 
 [Applause] 
 That was so great. 
 Oh, good, that means a lot to me. 
 I'm vegan, but I think now I'm ready to go full raw. 
 Well, you should. 
 You can even sign up for this home delivery. 
 Oh, well, that's convenient. 
 [Chuckles] That's the idea. 
 You were so confident up there. 
 I don't know how you do it. 
 Well, it helps to have enthusiastic people like you smiling back at me. 
 So, is your boyfriend vegan, too? 
 I don't have a boyfriend. 
 Well... 
 Shelley. 
 See you again, I hope. 
 Me too. 
 Well, your fingerprints from the Johnsons' break-in matched a meth-head caught trying to pawn the jewellery. 
 He was arrested, charged, incarcerated. 
 Well, moving on. 
 Exactly. 
 Can you read me the alarm company details? 
 Sure. So... 
 The door and window alarms were engaged at 7:15. 
 When his wife leaves for the ballet. 
 Yeah, they were disengaged at 8:31... 
 Uh-huh. 
 Engaged at 9:07. 
 Mm-hmm. 
 Disengaged, 9:19. 
 Mm-hmm. 
 Re-engaged at 9:59, and then the alarm was triggered at 10:01. 
 Right. 
 10:01, when the basement window was smashed. 
 The intruder enters, kills Jack Bergin and searches the house. 
 You ever seen anyone so obsessed with their home security? 
 Takes all sorts, I guess. 
 So why does Jack turn the alarm on and off twice before he died? 
 He had some visitors. 
 I'm just sorry Jack's out of town. 
 I would have loved for him to meet you. 
 Oh, well, I'm sure we'll meet eventually. 
 Some Pinot Gris? 
 Yeah, you read my mind. 
 So does your husband go away a lot? 
 Yeah, for work. 
 But he promised this was his last trip for a while. 
 Still, it must be hard on you. 
 Yeah, but I try to get out, keep busy. 
 I'm going to "Le Sacre du Printemps" next weekend. 
 By yourself? 
 Yeah, you couldn't drag Jack to the ballet. 
 Trust me, I've tried. 
 It's just easier on both of us if he stays home. 
 Where did you two meet? 
 Out east. 
 Most of... well, all of my family and friends are still back there. 
 Be honest, do you hate this city? 
 Um... 
 It's not easy making friends. 
 I've tried... 
 Well, you just haven't met the right people yet. 
 Cheers to that. 
 Cheers. 
 Where's the, um... Uh... 
 Oh, in the back on the left. 
 On the left? Okay. 
 [Timid knocking] Chloe? 
 [Hesitant knock] 
 [Voice shaky] Chloe? 
 Chloe, please be home. I really need to talk. 
 Lila, what is it? 
 I'm sorry. I should've called first. 
 I don't know what I was... 
 It's Jack. 
 He's dead. 
 What? 
 Last night when I was at the ballet, someone... 
 Broke into our house and killed him. 
 Oh, my God. 
 I hope it's all right. 
 I know we don't know each other very well, and this is so weird... 
 It's okay. 
 I didn't know where else to go. 
 Do the police know who did it? 
 They haven't told me anything. 
 Come in. 
 Jack Bergin's neighbour's photos. 
 This one he took last night. 
 Ah, so he was vigilant after all. 
 Is that a car parked in front of Jack's house? 
 Yeah, less than an hour before the break-in. 
 This looks like progress. 
 Well, the fingerprint on the fridge in charcoal? 
 Came back to the victim. 
 So much for getting lucky. 
 Car that was outside the house licensed to a Michael J. Park. 
 Relationship to the victim? 
 Jack Bergin's former business partner. 
 "Former" being the key word. 
 Now, what about the wife? 
 Nah, she was at the ballet all night. 
 The woman in the seat beside her confirms it. 
 All right, let's pick up this Michael J. Park character. 
 Let's see what was so important he had to go to our victim's house on a Saturday night. 
 [Knocking on door] 
 Hi! 
 Hi! 
 Come on in, give me a sec. 
 Thanks again for dinner last night. 
 It was so great to just... chat. 
 Yeah. And eat and drink. 
 Hey, do you know that store, Blubird? 
 Cute stuff. 
 Expensive, though. 
 I did the window display. 
 I could probably get us a discount. 
 I'm in your hands. 
 Oh, hey, are these yours? 
 Thank God. 
 I thought I'd lost them. 
 [Chuckling] Anyway... 
 We had a break-in down the street a few months ago. [Beeping alarm code] 
 That's horrible. 
 Yeah, and Jack's such a stickler for it, he insists that we set it even when we're at home. 
 How about this one? 
 Yeah, maybe. I don't know. 
 Do you think, Lila, that there might be someone else... 
 Someone more appropriate, that you should be talking to about this? 
 Like your family maybe? 
 Or-or his? 
 Jack's parents are gone, and, uh, my sister has her hands full looking after our mom, so she can't get here till Wednesday... 
 No, of course. It's okay. 
 We met at Douglas College, shared a dorm room first year. 
 Stayed in touch. 
 I formulated the entire Eating for Life retail product line. 
 So then why was your name taken off the incorporation papers? 
 I wasn't interested in selling sprout juice, so I moved on. 
 The whole health food business was Jack's thing. 
 He made it his life's calling. 
 Who ended the partnership? 
 He agreed to buy me out. 
 Is that why you were at his place on Saturday night? 
 He was stalling. 
 He said something about all the capital being tied up in new packaging or something... 
 It must have been quite the argument. 
 No, nothing like that. 
 Just... 
 He agreed to make the payment when he sold his house. 
 There was no argument. 
 So, how did he end up dead? 
 [Chuckles in disbelief] 
 I have no idea. 
 I... 
 I swung by and we talked and I left. 
 When? 
 I left around 9:00. 
 Where'd you go? 
 Home. 
 You didn't go back to finish the conversation? 
 Look, if I had killed Jack, I'd be killing the business, and then I lose out. 
 Even with the buy-out, I've got future royalties, stock options. 
 No. 
 He was alive when I left. 
 You should go talk to his wife. 
 Talk to his, uh, other friends. 
 Girlfriends? 
 [Sighs] Yeah. Guy thought he was a rock star. 
 Hey, it's me. 
 No, no, I'm still at the office. 
 Yeah, I've got all these orders I have to get out and I'm nowhere close. 
 Okay, I love you, too. 
 [Keys jingling in lock] 
 [Dog barks distantly] 
 To think that the person who killed Jack was touching our things, pawing through our stuff... 
 Just don't go there. 
 I can't stop thinking about it. 
 
 
 
 [Knock on door] 
 Can I help you? 
 Is Lila here? 
 Detectives Flynn and Vega. 
 Lila. 
 Detectives? 
 Hi. We just had a few more questions and we didn't want to bring you all the way down to the station. 
 Come in. 
 This is my friend, Chloe. 
 How's the case coming? 
 Slowly. 
 Any leads, or-or suspects? 
 Working on it. 
 Do you mind if we speak in private with Lila? 
 Chloe...? 
 Myton. 
 No. No, of course not. 
 I'll just stay here. 
 What time is it? 
 It's late. 
 Did you eat? 
 What are you wearing? 
 Is that new? 
 I went shopping with Chloe today. 
 Chloe? 
 I met her last week. 
 I want you to meet her. 
 I'm just glad you finally made a friend here. 
 Yeah. She's funny. 
 I think you'll like her. 
 I'm sure I will. 
 I'm going to go take a shower. 
 Angie : We spoke with Michael Park. 
 Jack was very private about his business. 
 I don't know much about his dealings with Michael. 
 Vega : Well, he was here that night, and then we think that Jack might have had another visitor. 
 I'm wondering if you know who that might have been. 
 No, I have no idea. 
 You ever suspect Jack of, uh... 
 Uh, being with someone else? 
 No. I never thought that. Never. 
 Jack was a good husband and he loved me. [Voice breaking] 
 I'm sorry. We had to ask. 
 Do you mind if we take a look around? 
 It's always an awkward question. 
 [Sighing] Yeah... 
 You want to start at the point of entry? 
 Downstairs. 
 So, who carries stun guns? 
 Police officers. Security guards. 
 And women. 
 It's a weapon designed for defence, right? 
 You heard Park. 
 Even though Lila doesn't think so, maybe he had a mystery woman? 
 Right, this is what I wanted to get a better look at. 
 Yeah, you're right. 
 That definitely wouldn't hold anybody's weight. 
 Mm-mm. 
 Nobody came through that window. 
 Yeah, this was staged. 
 Our whole timeline is shot. 
 I just don't know how you can still be hungry. 
 We just had lunch. 
 Yeah, but I didn't like it. 
 Yeah, but you ate it. 
 That's beside the point. You want some? 
 I do not... 
 Hey, guys, wait up! 
 I got us an exact time of death. 
 Walk faster, please. Thanks. 
 Jack Bergin's phone stopped receiving signals from the cell tower as soon as it hit the water, right? 
 Cell phone company has a record of when that happened. 
 You are kidding me. 
 Why would I be? 
 9:33 P.M. 
 That's before the alarm went off. 
 Yeah. 
 Can you go by Jack's office and ask around. 
 See if he had any female "friends" there. 
 So if the killer didn't come through the window, this might be them entering and exiting the house? 
 Which means... 
 The killer knew the alarm code. 
 Right. 
 According to Lila Bergin, you were the only other person who had their alarm code. 
 Did you ever share it with anybody? 
 Uh, nope. 
 And just between you and me, their house is overpriced. 
 I tried to get them to lower it, but he thought he knew better. 
 You ever spend any time alone with Jack? 
 Not that I recall. Why? 
 So he never made a pass at you? 
 Uh, no. 
 Just so we can cross you off our list, where were you between 9:00 and 10:00 on Saturday night? 
 Saturday night... 
 East side, closing a condo. 
 Studio apartment. 500 square feet. 
 $450,000. 
 What a steal. 
 Mm... [Slams trunk] 
 Hey, you mind if we hold onto this? 
 No problem. 
 Thanks. 
 What do you want to do now? 
 Stop. 
 It's the sign-in sheet for the Bergins' open house. 
 What was Lila's friend's name, the one we met the other day? 
 Chloe something. 
 Oh, yeah. Chloe. 
 There it is, Chloe Myton. 
 What's she doing at the open house? 
 Let's find out. 
 Chloe? 
 What does she have to do with this? 
 She never even met Jack. 
 Well, we just thought it was odd that she was at your open house. 
 She was? 
 So, she wasn't there on your behalf? 
 No, we hadn't met yet. 
 We met at a cooking class about... a month ago. 
 Does Chloe have your alarm code? 
 No. 
 And she... 
 She's been really great to me, especially since all of this happened. 
 Good friends are hard to find, aren't they? 
 Yes, they are. 
 [Knock on door] 
 Chloe? 
 Back here. 
 Oh, hey, your manager said you might be down here. 
 Can I bug you for a second? 
 I just want to fill in some blanks. 
 Sure. What's up? 
 You ever name 'em? 
 I'm sorry? 
 The mannequins. 
 No, I don't name them. 
 That'd be weird. Yeah. 
 So, um, I talked with Lila, and she didn't know you were at her open house six weeks ago. 
 Right. 
 I just, I didn't know how to tell her. 
 Why not? 
 It seems weird, but I... 
 By the time I realized that I'd been to her house, it was, like, it was too late, the moment had passed, and then it just seemed weird to bring it up. 
 Yeah. You ever meet her husband? 
 No, I never had the chance. 
 You never went to any of his seminars? 
 No. 
 Didn't meet him at the house? 
 No, sorry. 
 Well, great, that's it. 
 I'm going to just... 
 I'm going to see myself out. 
 Hey! 
 Oh, there you are. 
 What are you doing? 
 I came by, and the garage door was, like, wide open. 
 I-I wanted to make sure nobody got in. 
 I thought I should wait till you got here. 
 I was at the police station. 
 Weren't you at work today? 
 Yeah, I... 
 Well, they actually came there, too, so I just drove over here right after. 
 Did something happen? 
 Did they upset you? 
 My sister's coming tomorrow, so... 
 Well, that's good. 
 Family's important at a time like this. 
 If there's anything else I can do for you... 
 You've done so much already. 
 Lila... 
 I'm sorry it had to work out like this. 
 You didn't deserve it. 
 [Garage door squeaks shut] 
 Lucas, Chloe Myton. What do we know? 
 40 years old, parents are both alive, grew up outside of the city. 
 Marketing degree from Douglas College and works at the Leeds Clothing Company for almost three years. 
 No priors. 
 Can we match any of these prints to her? 
 She's been in the house a lot. 
 Is finding fingerprints really going to prove anything? 
 Forensics lifted over a hundred prints, mostly unidentifieds from the open house crowd, but they found three more sets in more intimate places. 
 What are we talking about? 
 I mean, medicine cabinet, under the desk, office drawers, things like that. 
 Three sets of prints. 
 We've got Jack, Lila's... 
 Chloe? 
 That hasn't been confirmed yet. 
 She was looking for something. 
 You know what's bugging me? 
 This one. 
 That's Jack's print in charcoal. 
 That's right. 
 Charcoal with traces of nitrate. 
 Which is an accelerant. 
 Yeah, but what's a raw food guy doing with charcoal on his hands? 
 He doesn't cook. 
 All right, well, let's see if they've got a barbecue. 
 [Dragging bins] 
 [Objects clattering] 
 Bingo. 
 This thing doesn't look like it's been used in years. 
 I got that. 
 What's the deal with the fresh briquettes? 
 What's down there? 
 [Hollow tapping] 
 I got it. 
 [Blowing dust] 
 Call Lucas. 
 Tell him to bring in Chloe Myton. 
 Have a seat. 
 I want to help Lila in any way that I can. 
 Well, that's great. 
 So you'll let me fingerprint you? 
 Excuse me? 
 It's standard operating procedure. 
 Process of elimination. 
 We don't want your fingerprints to be mistaken for the killer's. 
 Oh. Of course. Sure. 
 Of course not. 
 You're right-handed? 
 Yes. 
 Great. 
 So, thumb. 
 Press down and hold firmly. 
 Index... 
 Next finger. 
 Next. 
 And last. 
 Thanks. 
 I won't be a sec. 
 Chloe, this will really make things go more easily. 
 May I see your keys? 
 My keys? 
 Mm-hmm. 
 Sure. 
 So, I'm guessing your apartment? 
 Car key, of course. 
 What's this one? 
 For work. 
 And that leaves this one. 
 This is Lila's actual house key. 
 You have an exact copy. 
 You see? 
 Why do you have that? 
 She gave it to me. 
 No, she says she didn't. 
 She must have forgotten. 
 Well, maybe, because you spend a lot of time there, don't you? 
 Chloe :  She needed my help. 
 Angie :  She trusts you. 
 Should she? 
 What do you mean? 
 If we sent a crew to your house, would we find a stun gun? 
 A what? No. 
 You disposed of it already? 
 I don't know what you're talking about. 
 And besides, don't you need a search warrant to search my apartment? 
 Yes. 
 We're working on that. 
 So... 
 Those were your fingerprints in the house. 
 [Scoffs] 
 Well, I've spent a lot of time in her house. 
 But your fingerprints were everywhere. 
 Under the bed, inside the bathroom cabinets, all over the closet shelves. 
 You were looking for something. 
 And I know you didn't find it... 
 Because we did. 
 Would you like to open that? 
 That box was hidden underneath the coals in Jack's barbecue. 
 I can't imagine what you went through. 
 What an experience like that does to the rest of your life. 
 [Whispering] You have no idea. 
 No, I don't. 
 But I do understand... 
 Why you did it. 
 [Inhaling sharply] 
 You didn't get close to Lila to become friends with her. 
 You did it to get close to him, didn't you? 
 You planned every detail, made it look like a break-in. 
 You chose a night when Lila wouldn't be home. 
 It must have taken a lot of courage to face your attacker. 
 Yes. 
 [Sighs] 
 Yes, it did. 
 [Splashing] 
 What the... 
 Shut up. 
 Who are you? 
 Get out of my house! 
 Don't! 
 What do you want? 
 You. 
 Me? 
 Are you crazy? 
 April 3, 2003. 
 D-do you know how many times I've thought about that night? 
 Tried to imagine other scenarios? 
 What if I hadn't gone to bed so early? 
 What if I'd double-checked the window locks? 
 But... 
 Do you know what I realized? 
 It wasn't what I did or didn't do, it was what you did! 
 I think you've got me confused with... 
 I woke up, and you were on top of me. 
 You wore a mask... 
 But I saw that lion. 
 You took a picture of me. 
 I don't know what you're talking about. 
 Don't lie! 
 You know who I am. 
 Don't! 
 Okay... 
 Okay. 
 Admit what you did to me. 
 Don't do this. 
 Admit it! 
 Admit it! 
 I'm sorry for what I did. 
 [Scoffs] 
 No. 
 You're not. 
 [Stun bolts crackling] 
 [Roaring] 
 [Crackling falls silent] 
 Is this the part where I'm supposed to break down and cry? 
 Well, that's up to you. 
 But you should know there were other victims. 
 Oh, my God. 
 Those women might even thank you for what you did. 
 I didn't know there were others. 
 It's time to go. 
 [Whispers] I'm not sorry for what I did. 
 For the first time in years, I am actually free. 
 I believe you. 
 So, we're running Jack's DNA through the system. 
 Who knows what we'll find. 
 You okay? 
 Yeah, I'm fine. 
 And you know we did good today, right, Angie? 
 I mean, we got the killer. 
 That's a win in my book. 
 Yeah, it doesn't feel like a win to me. 
 It feels screwed up. 
 Hey, how about dinner? 
 Ribs? Burger, fries? 
 I mean, I'll even do Mexican. 
 Whatever you want, dealer's choice. 
 I don't have much of an appetite. 
 You sure? 
 This may not come around again. 
 No, I'm gonna bring this up to s*x crimes, and I'll see you later.
