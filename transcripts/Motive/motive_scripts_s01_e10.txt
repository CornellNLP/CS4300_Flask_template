 [Clears throat awkwardly] 
 Bless me, father, for I have sinned. 
 It's been... 
 A long time since my last confession. 
 Is there something weighing on your mind, my son? 
 I think I may have cheated on my wife. 
 You think? 
 Here's the thing. 
 Is it cheating if you're not the, uh... active participant? 
 What would your wife say about that technicality? 
 So... 
 Say a couple of Hail Marys or something? 
 No. 
 Contrition means taking responsibility for your actions. 
 Brood on it. 
 Can I get a confit and a ratatouille? 
 Can I get service, please? 
 Two osso bucco, table seven! 
 Lobster bisque is up to table four! 
 Felix! 
 What have you done to my soup? 
 Why is this fine and this bowl is so salty it could cause a stroke? 
 But I saw you season it before it went out. 
 You're blaming me for your soup? 
 The food critic from west coast living just sent this back! 
 I don't know if you're trying to sabotage me, or you're too stupid to breathe, but either way, you're out! 
 No, no, no, you're not really doing this. 
 Ignacio, you're on soup. 
 Yes, chef. 
 Sorry I'm late. 
 What do we got? 
 Front doors were locked. 
 Looks like the back doors were open. 
 Lights were off, so it was dark. 
 Oh, sorry. 
 You were saying? 
 Should I be doing that? 
 No. 
 Okay. 
 Uniforms responded to a garbled 911 call, apparently from the victim. 
 We should get the lab to clean that up. 
 Yes. Yes. 
 Hey, aren't you supposed to be on a beach in Hawaii, drinking Mai Tais? 
 Tell me about it. 
 First vacation I plan in two years, and half the staff decide to get the flu. 
 They can't live without you. 
 Oh, it's a conspiracy. 
 Okay, so this is Father Noel Barnett. 
 He is the pastor at St. Roch Catholic Parish. 
 Call came in 12:43, uniforms found the body 20 minutes later. 
 Looks like there's more than one weapon. 
 Blunt force injury to the head. 
 Throat was slashed. 
 Wound looks ragged. 
 Could all this damage be the result of a struggle? 
 I didn't see any other defensive wounds. 
 No other scratches or bruises. 
 This must have happened very quickly. 
 Not a sustained beating. 
 I'll know more when I do my internal exam. 
 All right. 
 Later. 
 Nice to see you. 
 He walks in on a desecration and is surprised? 
 He didn't see it coming. 
 Well, they had a beef with the catholic church. 
 Who has this much rage? 
 Former catholics.

 Motive 01x10 
Fallen Angel 
Original Air Date April 25, 2006 
 So, this door was locked. 
 Bed wasn't slept in. 
 So he didn't wake up to the sound of intruders. 
 I don't think he was here last night. 
 So where was he at midnight? 
 Doesn't make any sense, that church is beautiful, and this priest is living like a prisoner. 
 What's the point? 
 Well, this level of devotion takes a lot of discipline, Ange. 
 I, uh, I find it remarkable. 
 I thought you left the catholic church. 
 That doesn't mean I don't respect it. 
 Hey, come here. What's this? 
 Parishioner roll? 
 I got his day planner. 
 It's his schedule. 
 Yesterday was the last entry. 
 "Find RS... DV." 
 Who's R.S.? 
 What's "D. V.", initials? 
 Could be deo volente, which is Latin for "God willing." 
 That's very impressive. What about RS? 
 I have no idea. 
 We'll have to go through the whole thing and decipher it. 
 Well, we can do that. 
 I saw the Da Vinci Code. 
 [Turns off engine] 
 [Door lock buzzes] 
 Personals in the tray. 
 Arms up. 
 Watch. 
 Kryztof Woz, number 22936. 
 His visitor's here. 
 [Door lock buzzes] 
 You have half an hour. 
 Okay, so the lights were off. 
 It would have been dark. 
 These were lit. Wax on the floor. 
 Lucky the whole church didn't burn down. 
 So they're tearing the place apart, Father Barnett walks in on them, startles them, they attack him. 
 They? 
 Well, I'm thinking two weapons, multiple suspects? 
 There were no signs of forced entry. 
 The keys were found by the body, and that's not signs of break-in. 
 Either the door was open or he unlocked it. 
 Yeah. 
 What is this? 
 Is that cast-off spray from the throat cut? 
 Why is it so far from the body? 
 Must have been a wide slash, more of a swing. 
 Uh-huh. 
 I wonder why he came up here. 
 Hey. 
 Look at this. 
 You see the blood on the outside of the statue? 
 There's nothing on the inside. 
 Meaning the blood hit the statue before it broke. 
 Yeah. 
 So they killed the priest first, and then destroyed this room. 
 They walked in on him. He didn't walk in on them. 
 Yeah. 
 [Door lock buzzes] 
 I didn't think you would come. 
 You're all grown up, Felix. 
 I can't believe it. 
 Yeah. 
 What's all this? 
 This is lung cancer, kid. 
 So, why call me, Woz? 
 There was nobody else. 
 I only knew you when I was a kid. 
 That's why I called. 
 You didn't deserve what happened to you. 
 Well, I got good at being by myself. 
 And it's not like you could have done anything about it from in here anyway, right? 
 True, but I kept tabs on you. 
 Why? I'm not your responsibility. 
 Look kid, it was a messed-up situation. 
 We thought we knew what we were doing, but we didn't. 
 People got hurt. 
 I never thought I'd be in this place as long as I have. 
 Greed's a terrible thing. 
 What do you want me to tell you? 
 Go talk to a priest. 
 I have. A long time ago. 
 It's not the point. 
 You got left out to dry. 
 I'm trying to say that whatever part I played in that, I take full responsibility. 
 It is what it is. 
 Looking doom in the eye makes you rethink things. 
 They never found my half of the take. 
 I want to try to help you out. 
 How much? 
 Today's dollars? 
 It's worth a fortune. 
 I'll send you a message with the location. 
 These walls have ears. 
 And? 
 What else is there? 
 Tell me where he is. 
 Tell me where my father is. 
 I wish I could. 
 Father Heslop is the associate pastor with the church. 
 Father, this is Detective Vega. 
 Hi, father. 
 This must be a terrible shock for you. 
 I just don't believe this is happening. 
 I saw Noel yesterday. 
 What time was that? 
 We closed up the church at 8:00. 
 We had our end of day meeting. 
 How was Father Barnett acting last night? 
 Was anything on his mind? 
 Noel was a little preoccupied. 
 There was a call for last rites at the hospice. 
 I took it because Noel said he had a matter to attend to. 
 You have any idea what that was? 
 I don't know, but he had his car keys with him. 
 He was going somewhere. 
 Was he in the church at midnight often? 
 No. 
 He usually took to private prayer in the rectory. 
 He was a stickler for saving heat and power. 
 We're not a wealthy parish. 
 Did something happen inside? 
 We're investigating. 
 What, like a robbery? 
 Homicide. 
 It's going to take a long time, I guess, the investigating, then? 
 All the CSI stuff. 
 Until we catch the perpetrator, sir. 
 No, I just mean, like, this part... 
 Around the church. 
 Are you a congregant here? 
 Me, no, I'm not catholic. 
 Just curious. 
 What's your name, sir? 
 Jean. 
 Badger. 
 Do you live in the neighbourhood, Mr. Badger? 
 No, I'm, actually... 
 I'm just, uh, picking some stuff up from a friend's place, and I gotta go, but good luck with your investigating. 
 No, let me through! 
 No! No! No! No! 
 No! 
 Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa... 
 Where is he? Where's Father Noel? 
 Ma'am, we are homicide detectives. 
 Homicide? 
 It's true? 
 He's dead? 
 Yes, I'm sorry to say. 
 I knew it. I told him to stay away from them, but he wouldn't listen to me. 
 Stay away from who? 
 The devil worshippers. 
 She's crazy. 
 I mean, she thinks, like, black jeans are a sign of devil worship. 
 I had to ask. 
 How often did Father Barnett come here? 
 Couple times a week. 
 I mean, he was okay. 
 You know, he didn't, like, judge you, or anything. 
 Everybody here loved him. 
 Did you see him last night? 
 Yeah. 
 Yeah, he came by around 10:00, dropped off a scarf and a dress shirt for me. 
 Yeah? What for? 
 I had a job interview today. 
 He wanted to make sure that I looked good. 
 See, like, that's what I mean. 
 Like, I'm not even that catholic, and he cared. 
 You know where he went after that? 
 He's a priest. It's none of my business. 
 I'm just trying to find out who killed him. 
 I saw a girl in his car. 
 He drove off with her. 
 That is a beautifully marbled steak. 
 You cook that well done, I might have to hunt you down. 
 [Laughing] 
 Felix, my man! How's it hanging? 
 You know, it's hanging. 
 Well, swing it around this way. 
 I got some fresh organic birds I gotta get out. 
 Hey, you see that Sacramento game last night? 
 What a barn-burner! 
 Nobody took the over, thank God. 
 I would have lost my shirt. 
 So how did that thing work out with your aunt, or your cousin, or what? 
 Un, Uncle. 
 So, how much you get? 
 Uh, nothing yet. 
 Nothing, huh? 
 No, it's just, uh, the lawyer needed to do something or other. 
 Like paperwork, you know? 
 Yeah, but you're in the will. 
 It's not like anybody's contesting it, right? 
 Uh, h-hey, I was looking at the Indiana game tonight. 
 Wh-what's the line on that? 
 Uh, ten and a half. 
 You sure you want to do that? 
 Yeah. I got a good feeling. 
 You also got a big tab that's overdue. 
 What if I eat the spread, take them at even, and wipe out the tab including the vig? 
 Yeah, but if you lose, the vig doubles. 
 I'll take it. 
 After this inheritance comes in, I'll have enough to cover it and then some. 
 And it's just a couple more days, tops. 
 All right, 20 g's on Indiana. 
 Don't say I'm not a fair-minded individual. 
 All right, see you. 
 [Pounding on door] 
 Listen to me, kid! 
 You want to say sorry, great, you're forgiven. 
 Doesn't do me any good. 
 If you found your father, what would you do? 
 I don't know, maybe ask him if three postcards in 20 years was all he could manage. 
 Scream in his face... 
 Punch him in the nose. 
 It wasn't his choice. He had to go. 
 He could have taken me with him. 
 No, he couldn't. 
 Says you. 
 But then you're in here, dying. 
 I'm sorry, I don't mean to take it out on you. 
 He made his choice, and I just wasn't one of them. 
 There's no law that says you have to love your kids. 
 [Door lock buzzes] 
 I'll make it up to you, kid. 
 It's too late. 
 Looks like the half an hour is up. 
 Indiana takes the lead. Toronto has four time-outs. 
 Six seconds left on the clock. 
 Indiana up by two. 
 It all comes down to the last shot. Defense, defense, defense. Inbound to McCall. Out to Reddick. He sets. Three-point shot... It's good! Toronto wins! [Screaming in rage] No! [Stomping] [Roaring in frustration] [Screams echo] He's going to find out. No, he won't. I promise you. If he does, he'll kill me. I won't let that happen. But what about money? I have $30 in my purse. Nothing else. Get in. I'll take care of it. Please, you have to trust me. [Starts car] See, a large bruise covers the entire side of his face. He was hit by a wide object travelling at a high rate of speed. So not a bat or a pipe or something like that. That's right. I also found bruising on the other side of his brain from where it bashed against the skull. Did it knock him out? Well, it disoriented him at least. You know, it takes a surprising amount of force to knock somebody out. Plus, we know he was standing when his throat was cut. So he's hit, but he got away from his killers long enough to call 911. You said "killers." It could be just one person. See, look, the skin around the wound is torn. Not a particularly sharp blade. Maybe not a blade at all. I found this inside the wound. Soil and a bit of organic matter. Grass probably. So, a shovel. Yup, you're looking for a spade with a square edges and sharp points. See, it was a flat blow to the back of the head, then it was turned on its side, and it slashed across the left external carotid. One person could have done it all. Yeah. Sombeody must have really been pissed off with Father Barnett. The lab couldn't clean it up? If it was static, maybe, but with drop-outs, there's nothing to clean. We're looking for one attacker. Sketch artist just finished with a girl who saw this woman with Father Barnett at 10:00. Listen to this. It's the 911 call. Garbled playback : St. Roch, please help me... [Voice breathless, sound cutting out] He's trying to kill me... [Muffled word] "St. Roch. Please help me. He's trying to kill me." I'm not sure about the last word. Play the last part back again. Voice muffled and unclear : ...Huz... Husband? I think you're right. Now we really gotta find the wife. Husband. Husband, husband. Was Father Barnett maybe... Slipping in his vows? Impossible. Noel lived a life of solitude and prayer. He lived for St. Roch. His social time was spent trying to help people and raising money for the church. Father, do you know what this is? He must have transposed this from the master list. These are graveyard internments. Is there any way that you can help us decipher these initials? You can see that "R. S." is mentioned five times in the last six months. First three were on Mondays. It was R.S. plus M.C. MC stands for "Marriage Classes." R.S. stands for Rita Sopressa. Married to Mario Sopressa. And the last entry was just before the murder. You can see that it has a D.V. beside it. What about that one? DV stands for "Domestic Violence." Felix! I was gonna call you. Oh, those buzzer-beaters are a heartbreak. Aw, you know, I feel for you, pal. So how's that inheritance working out? You know, double the vig is going to be expensive. Yeah, no, it's just a few more days. That's all. Really? [Pulls freezer door shut] Aw, tick tock, can't stop the clock. You know, you don't want to let the meter run too long, you know? Hey, which reminds me, I made a delivery, some nice New York strips and some soup bones to that swank place you work at, and what do I find? You're not there anymore. I quit. Is that right? No point killing myself if I got all this money coming in, right? Minus what you owe. Yeah. Yeah, there's plenty enough to go around. Gabe and I were talking about that. 40 grand is a big nut for a guy who just quit his job. Maybe we put Gabe's mind at ease and you give him the name of the lawyer that's holding up the works, and he'll check what's what. Uh, Jean Badger... And Associates. [Laughs] Like the weasel. Oh, that's a good name for a lawyer. Thanks. Mario Sopressa? You were married at St. Roch's Church four months ago? Yeah, that's right. MPD, homicide. I've got some questions for you? Is Rita okay? You have reason to believe she isn't? She took off in the middle of the night. She calls someone, and she's gone. I've been looking everywhere for her. And yet here you are. Yeah, I'm not a rich man. I gotta work. Can you tell us where you were the night before last around midnight? I was on the highway, coming back from Abbotsford. And what's in Abbotsford? Her parents. I thought she was there. Hey, look, you got to find her. Why did she leave? I don't know. Really? No trouble in the marriage? No physical altercations? Hey, that's a lie. Who told you that? Father Barnett. What, the priest who married us? What the hell would he know? I'd like to see him say that to my face. It's 923, grave 923. There is no 9-2-3. There are only 94 plots in the cemetery. You sure? Forget this foolishness. Woz is just an old man playing games. I wouldn't trust anything he says. How did you know that Woz told me? Who else could it be? So... you Haven't heard from my dad... Once over all these years? Other than the postcards he sent you, no, never. He left you to my care, and I did the best I could. Do you need money? Let me help you. No, no, no, I'll figure it out. You've done enough, father, and I don't blame you for any of this. It's him. I hate him. You have to unburden yourself, Felix. There is nothing lighter than a forgiving heart. God can forgive him when he's dead. The in-laws confirm Mario Sopressa was at their home in Abbotsford. He was banging on the front door and screaming for Rita. They say he gave up around 11:45 when they called the police, and dispatch has confirmed. There's no way he makes it back to the city in time to kill Father Barnett. Then where's the wife? She was the last one to see him alive. She was trying to escape an abusive husband. She didn't go to her parents, she went to her priest. You know that world. Tell me what he does. He would take her someplace safe, somewhere where the husband wouldn't know. Women's shelter. Yeah. Women's shelter run by the Catholic Charities. Except those lists are kept confidential. There's no way we're going to get a list of those. Let me make some calls. I know someone who can get us there. I'd rather talk to them alone. I'll just be a minute. 
 
 I can't believe he's dead. You're sure it wasn't Mario? We're sure. You can't tell him where I am. He'll never find out where you are, and if he ever comes near you again, I will personally slap the cuffs on him, okay? You have my word. What time did Father Barnett bring you here? It was after 11:00, I think. He was a Saint. He did everything he could to help me. Do you know where he was going after? Back home. Where else would he go? Vega : Did he talk about meeting up with someone? No. Do you know if anything was troubling him? He was just focused on getting me to a safe place. I owe him my life. Listen, if you ever need anything, you call us, okay? Anything. Thank you. Wait a second. When I called Father Barnett, I told him I didn't have any money. I just wanted to get out of there. He didn't have cash, but he said he'd make sure I never had to go back to Mario. He gave me these. ( ♪ ) No, no, no, no... Dammit. So, it's midnight. The church lights are off, it's dark. There's no one around. He parks there, but he doesn't go into the rectory. Instead, he goes into the church. Does he see something inside? Well, the doors were locked, and he's the only one with the key, so... So he sees somebody outside and he runs into the church. Is he scared? Somebody with a shovel and bad intentions? That's everything. You don't have one with a square blade? What you see here is what I got. Nothing's missing. Okay. When was the last interrment? Here? Uh, maybe 60 years ago. Have you had any incidents of graves being disturbed? Most of these graves are over a hundred years old. Nothing ever changes around here. Except last week. Last week? Felix. Looks like time isn't on your side, pal. Let's talk it over. What do you say? He had me replace the old one. It was worn out. Why do you replace an 80-year-old gravestone? The family must have ordered it? Maybe they didn't like the idea of grandma being under a worn-out stone. Grandma was 10 years old when she died. Don't ask me, man. I just cut the grass around here. Is this your doing? No. That's new. I've been pretty good to you, Felix. I mean, you win a bet, it's not like you gotta come chase me down. You know where to find me, and I got the cash, and you get paid, right? Yeah, sure, Clive. Okay, look, I'm not totally unsympathetic. I get that 40 grand is a big whack of money. Hey, it would take me a day or two to come up with that kind of scratch. But still, I would do it, because I honour my agreements, and I expect the same. Yeah, no, absolutely, Clive. It's just, I just don't have the money yet. Don't give me this story about your dead uncle, because Gabe checked, and there is no lawyer named Badger. So you can stop that right now. I'm not expecting everything at once, okay? Okay. Now, let me see the watch. [Chuckling] No, dummy, the pocket watch. The one you keep rubbing every time you get nervous. Yeah, now, here's something. I mean, you give me this, this buys you time. I saw a watch like this on ebay for five grand. It was my father's. Father should have told you that taking Indiana without the spread was a bad idea. I'm going to take this, and you're going to come up with some more cash soon. You bring me what you've got, doesn't matter how much, and we're going to keep doing that until you pay me off. Okay. Sure. Atta boy. You got yourself a deal. Let's shake. [Screaming in pain, bones crunch] [Screams echo] I doubt anybody visited that grave in years. I can't find a Becorn. There's no Becorns left in the city. Getting a court order to dig up the grave without cause won't be easy. We need the family. Anybody. Closest one I could find lives halfway across the country. Well, give it to me. It's worth a try. Hold the phone! This better be interesting. It's always interesting when he gets like this. Barnett ordered the stone from Jessop Granite Works last week. Bought and paid for an Oxford Grey marker. Cost? $563. That's not interesting. He called them from the church. Doesn't tell us why he changed the gravestone. That's right. So I checked the rest of the phone records. He only made one other call that day. It was three minutes after he ordered the stone. 15-minute conversation. Stop burying the lead. Just tell us who he called. Harper Maximum Security Prison. Now, that is interesting. [Clucks proudly] The phone records say that Father Barnett called Harper Prison at 1:14 P.M. on the 23rd. [Guard typing] 1:14 P.M. incoming. Cell block three. That's the medical ward. Prisoner number 22936. Kryztof Woz. Can we see him? He died on the 30th. Two weeks ago. Lung cancer. He's buried in our cemetery. No family in attendance. All right, thank you. He have any visitors before he died? Priest, maybe? Uh... One. One visitor on the 20th. Felix Hausman. You want his info? Yeah, you bet we do. [Typing] Meet Kryztof Woz. Born 1948. From 1981 to 1988, he was arrested for a series of B&Es. Nine times. Convicted... Twice. Time served... Four years. Which brings us to 1993... When a diamond merchant's home was robbed, and two men made off with... Two million in one-carat brilliant-cut diamonds. You know, you two should book an act in Vegas. Shush. We're on a roll. After a week-long manhunt, Woz was captured, convicted, and he received... A 25-year sentence. Not granted parole. His accomplice was never identified, and the diamonds were never recovered. A couple of days ago, our victim hands Rita Sopressa two brilliant-cut diamonds to get her out of a violent marriage. You're not saying Father Barnett was the accomplice. Well, he had the diamonds. [Chuckling] No, no. No way. No way? No, you're right, 'cause whoever heard of a priest doing anything illegal? Why are you suddenly not interested in facts? Why aren't you suddenly ignoring a motive? There is nothing in his past to suggest anything but that he was a caring priest who tried to help people. He gave up everything for the church. [Pointedly] He had the diamonds. And maybe he pried them off a chalice. Everything in churches is either cubic zirconia or semiprecious stones. Nothing with diamonds. That is inaccurate. You hate a coincidence as much as I do. I can think of a dozen ways that he got them. You know, he administered last rites and Woz gave it to him personally. Maybe the real accomplice put them in the donation box. Hey, how about this guy, Felix Hausman, what's he doing? Who is this guy visiting him in prison? He would have been 10 years old when the diamonds were stolen. What is this, catholic blinders? I just don't buy it, Ange, that's all. I know this is a touchy subject for you. Oh, please don't do that. It's not a touchy subject. It feels like it is. I left the church. I feel good. I'm grounded. I'm in a good place. I'm spiritually... Yeah, I need a coffee. Oscar... No, no, I'll be back. Just continue with your show. I'm going to go see Father Heslop. [Flynn sighs] I've seen him. At the crime scene. I love this church. Are you catholic, Detective Vega? I was raised. Not anymore. You shouldn't deny yourself a spiritual life. I'm still spiritual, father, just non-denominational. Does the name Felix Hausman mean anything to you? Is he a suspect? He's a person of interest. We found some records that have Felix Hausman living next to the church 20 years ago. Well, it was long before I got here, but that used to be St. Roch's Orphanage. It was closed. Budget cutbacks. Who ran the orphanage? Father Barnett. You really fired up Detective Vega. Well, it got us a connection between Felix and the priest, didn't it? I suppose. [Knock on door] Felix, right? Yeah. You remember me. Yeah. Your former boss told us where we could find you. What was her name? Jean Baget. Funny, that. Didn't you tell Detective Lucas your name was Jean Badger? Yeah, I... I was just curious, and I didn't really want to get involved. Yeah, I can understand that. Listen, I'm feeling a little parched here. Think we could come in and get a glass of water? I actually don't really have anything. Sorry. So I guess you've lied to me twice. You knew Father Barnett. You didn't mention that you grew up in the St. Roch Orphanage. Why would I? It was a long time ago, and I haven't seen him in years. But you just happened to walk by the church the morning that we're investigating his murder? Coincidence. Hmm. Detective Lucas doesn't believe in coincidences, but I know, you do this job long enough, they happen. Well, all right, no harm, no foul. We just had to tie up these loose ends before we put this thing to bed. Thanks for your time. Well, wait, so you... You found the killer? No, but after 48 hours, it gets tough. We got to move on to other cases, you know? Oh, yeah, no, I heard that somewhere. Hey, uh, one more thing. Does the name Leslie Becorn mean anything to you? No. No, nothing. Nope. Should it? It's just an old grave behind the church. It was disturbed. Just thinking maybe we'll find some evidence that'll link us to our killer. We got to get a court order to dig it up. Those things take forever, but we'll get one. Anyway, thanks for your time. You know you've got to move your van. I don't understand what you just did there. Well, we can't dig up the grave without a warrant, but he can. But why would he? Because he wants the diamonds. And we want the murder weapon. [Breathing hard] Drop it, Felix. That's not a good idea. Drop it. Hey... you're not going to hurt me, and I don't want to shoot you. So drop it. [Sighs in defeat] Square blade. Thank you. [Handcuffs rattle] Can I take a shot at him first? Absolutely. [Door opens] [911 call plays back] St. Roch... please help me... I think he's trying to kill me... Huz... "Trying to kill me. Hausman." It's not that clear. The shovel my partner found in your hands is pretty clear. Probably matches the wounds found on Father Barnett's head and throat. You know, an orphanage isn't a perfect place to grow up, is it? What would you know about it? I know that your mother died in childbirth, and that's got to weigh on you. I mean, it's not your fault, but, you know, there it is. Kryztof Woz had an accomplice when he stole those diamonds, and that was your father. Cyrus Hausman. Must have made for interesting family dinners. He kept that stuff away from me. He was all I had. I loved him. Well, sure, but $2 million in diamonds comes into play, and, well, your father takes off, Woz goes to prison, and you end up in the St. Roch Orphanage with a friendly priest trying to take care of you. I made do. Right. You signed for a package from the jail. Kryztof Woz's personal effects. He wanted you to have them. I wonder what was in the box. So he goes digging for the diamonds, and Father Barnett gets in the way. Yeah, I don't think that's why he killed him. You want to share? Well, when we were digging in that hole, we didn't find any diamonds. Father Barnett found them years ago. But he didn't know that. Till he started digging. Rejection. Abandonment. Do you have a job, Felix? Do you find it hard to hold down a job? What about a girlfriend? Do you have a girlfriend? Have you ever had a girlfriend? If I ask around about you, what will I find out? Unpaid debt? Gambling. See, sometimes, we run toward the thing that actually hurts us. That's our way of learning to cope with the loss and the rejection. What do you want? I want to understand. After you killed Father Barnett, the man who helped raise you, you had time before the cops came, but you did not go back and dig up the diamonds. You went back, and you covered up the grave. You want to tell me what you found in the hole? Exactly what Woz wanted me to find. Flynn : You only had to dig a few feet deep  into an existing grave. It was the perfect place for Woz to hide a body. Your father's body. Flynn : Then there's this Barnett  with his failing church to support. All those years, he knew. He knew your father was dead, and he watched you suffer. [Felix breathing hard] Flynn : Watched you suffer with that abandonment and that rejection. Woz killed and buried your father. He asked me to come to the prison for confession. He told me everything. You knew he was here? And the postcards? I sent those to you. I couldn't watch you in so much pain. [Screams] Then why didn't you tell me? It was confession, a sacrament. I couldn't tell you. He told me the diamonds were here. I didn't believe it. But then I found them... And him. It was the greater good. 20 years I've kept St. Roch open. Those diamonds helped so many people, Felix. Even you. The money I gave you. I wish I could have stopped you from gambling it away. You were like a son to me. I had a father. Felix... Listen to me. The diamonds are still here, and whatever's left? All yours. I won't say a word. Felix? [Cries out] I think he's trying to kill me. Felix Hausman. I'm sorry, Lord, forgive me for my sins.. Too late. [Blow thuds] I was a son to him... And he sacrificed me for his church. He took everything that I had... knowing that I spent my whole life just hating. The only person who ever loved me. Good morning, father. I almost became a priest. Three years at St. Augustine Seminary. What changed your mind? I never liked the politics. What I really miss was the quiet times. Kind of like this, just sitting here. So you joined the police force? [Chuckles] I guess sometimes the job picks you. I don't know, I'm still figuring it out. We're works in progress, right? I hear that. What about this place? Father Barnett was the only reason St. Roch stayed open all these years. Eventually, everything here will be sold off. The only thing of value, of course, is the gold chalice. Something troubling you? That's where he was headed towards. Where was the key to the tabernacle that night, father? It was on Father Barnett's keychain. I have it here. Do you mind? Not at all. You know, if there was a false wall in there, it would be a perfect hiding place. Would you care to take a look? Me? No. No, this isn't my church, father. [Rattling] [Whispers] Good Lord.
