 [Door locks buzz open] 
 You look good. 
 What are you doing here? 
 Come on, we're already late. 
 [Players on court shouting] 
 I told you. 
 I'm not coming back. 
 Jason, I don't have time for this, okay? 
 We've got to prep for lunch, come on, let's go... 
 No, mom... 
 I'm done. 
 Don't be stupid. Where are you going to go? 
 I'm staying with Dean. 
 Oh, that moron? [Scoffs] Absolutely not. 
 Come on, get in the car. 
 [Horn honks a greeting] 
 Jason, the last time you made your own decision, you wound up in jail. 
 Ten months away from you was the best thing that's ever happened to me. 
 Don't say that. 
 Jason, I need to talk to you about something. 
 Whatever it is, I don't want to hear it. 
 Yeah, run away. 
 You're just like your father, refusing to accept responsibility! 
 [Engine starts] [Car drives away] 
 [Whispering] Come on, come on... 
 Were you followed? 
 Hey... 
 It's okay. 
 You're safe now. 
 I need your phone. 
 What? 
 Look, all the women here have been through what you're going through right now. 
 It's just the way things work. 
 Thanks. 
 This is a burner phone. 
 Only give your number to people you trust. 
 Hey... you know who looks like they could use some pancakes? 
 That bear. 
 Why don't you help me make some while your mom gets settled in? 
 [Hoses gushing] 
 [Sirens wailing] 
 I just want a little more time. 
 That sounds reasonable. 
 Yeah, but Samantha wants an answer now, and I feel really put on the spot. 
 Wait a minute, Angie, you've testified before. 
 I don't understand. 
 Not in a case this big before. 
 And I've never been a character witness for my boss. 
 Plus, I didn't even know Cross when he was undercover. 
 Why? Why? 
 Well, what does Cross want? 
 He wants me to... he wants me to testify. 
 Well, what do you want? 
 [Sighing] I'm not sure. 
 Ready? 
 Yeah. 
 Hey. 
 [Police radios crackling] 
 That's too bad. 
 This place had the best grilled cheese in the city. 
 And you've had them all. 
 I have. 
 Fire department got the call at 6:15 AM. 
 The fire was hot and fast, mostly contained in the kitchen. 
 It's pretty rough. 
 Is it? 
 Yeah. 
 [Groans] Aw... 
 There was no ID on the body, and the diner's owned by a Barbara Birk, aged 40. 
 She's not answering her phone, and her car is parked outside, so... 
 So. So this could be her. 
 Well, I'll have to use dental records for a positive ID. 
 Was fire the cause of death? 
 The position of her body indicates that she was alive and breathing when the fire started. 
 Burning to death, that's got to be one of the most... 
 Painful ways to die. 
 Yeah, no one deserves that. 
 [Siren chirps] 
 No, no, no... 
 [Murmuring nervously] No, no, no, no... 
 This your vehicle, ma'am? 
 No, I borrowed it from a friend. 
 Can I get you to step out, please? 
 Why? What is this about? 
 Step out of the vehicle, please. 
 I did nothing wrong. 
 You were driving a stolen car. 
 It was reported last week. 
 I want my phone call. 
 Hey. Hey, it's me. It's Sasha. 
 Um... the police are saying the truck was stolen. 
 All right, so we've got a kitchen fire at the diner. 
 Well, we could be looking at an accident, alright. 
 Not likely. [Sighing] 
 Fire department found this lighter in the kitchen at the fire's point of origin. 
 Also, the diner's closed on Mondays. 
 So what was our victim doing here at 6:00 AM? 
 Lucas, can you track down the next of kin? 
 Right on it. 
 Ah, always a gentleman, Detective Lucas. 
 [Chuckling] 
 You know who I haven't heard much about lately is Mary. 
 How is she? 
 Um... Mary's good. You know, we're... 
 You know how marriage can be. 
 I sure do. 
 I remember all three of mine. 
 [Laughs] 
 Um, Detectives? 
 Yeah? 
 The fire inspector thinks this was most likely arson. 
 Okay, they're gonna need uh... insurance information, business records, a list of employees for the last six months, that kind of thing. 
 Thank you, officer. 
 Victim's next of kin is her son, Jason Birk, 22. 
 And get this, he just got out of jail. 
 He did? When? 
 Three weeks ago. 
 For what? 
 Assault causing bodily harm, vandalism, and he served ten months. 
 That doesn't look good. 
 And he's the beneficiary to his mom's life insurance and her business insurance. 
 That looks even worse. 
 I haven't talked to my mom in a while. 
 Why not? 
 You two don't get along? 
 I don't know, it's complicated. 
 Hmm. 
 When was the last time you saw her? 
 Not since I got out of prison. 
 She came to talk to me this morning, but I sent her away. 
 Do you remember what time that was? 
 It was early. 
 I didn't check my watch. 
 Do you recognize this? 
 Yeah, it's my lighter. 
 It's from the diner. 
 I kept it on the shelf next to the stove. 
 What, you... you don't think that I did this? 
 Anyone that worked there would know where it was. 
 Except that you are the beneficiary of all her insurance. 
 I am? 
 You are. 
 Listen, just because we weren't talking doesn't mean that I didn't love her. 
 I understand. 
 We just need to know where were you at 6:00 AM. 
 The same place I've been the last three weeks. 
 Asleep on my buddy's couch. 
 And your buddy, can he vouch for your whereabouts? 
 Yeah. 
 Dean Binders. Go ask him. 
 There ya go. 
 You ever work in a kitchen before? 
 Yeah. 
 Okay. You'll do fine, then. 
 Now, I want you to listen up. 
 I don't want you to be late, don't make a mess, and don't steal from me. Okay? You get that? 
 Yup. 
 All right, I need a Franklin, a Bunnywrap, grilled cheese. 
 Frog sticks across the board. 
 Got it. 
 I need a skillet for the Franklin. 
 Can you grab it? 
 Skillet for the Franklin... 
 There ya go. 
 You haven't worked in a kitchen before, have you? 
 Are you gonna tell your mom? 
 Look, I really need this job. 
 You wanna learn a pro trick? 
 It's all in the wrist. 
 Hmm? 
 Like a pro. 
 [Laughing] 
 Wait five minutes, then flip 'em. 
 I'll be back before then. 
 And don't forget to wash up. 
 So Jason was with you all night? 
 Yeah, sure. We got drunk. 
 You went to the bar together? 
 Every night this week. 
 Since he got out, all he wants to do is party. 
 How did he seem last night? 
 Normal. 
 Um... we left the bar at 2:00, and then we came back here, and we kept on drinking until we both passed out. 
 Alright, so you wouldn't really know if he left at any point, would you? 
 I guess not. 
 What about his mom? Did she come by? 
 Oh, man, Barbara, yeah, she was banging on the door at 5:45 this morning. 
 I looked at my clock when I got up because it was still dark out, so that's how I knew. 
 Anyway, um... 
 Here... 
 Thank you, sir. 
 Yeah, Jason refused to talk to her. 
 Did she say what she want? 
 No, but she was in a hurry. 
 You know her well? 
 No, thank God. 
 She's the worst thing about living with Jason. 
 Uh, she's always on his case about something. 
 He told me that she used to check his emails and that she would check his phone messages, and he had to get whole new accounts. 
 Hey. 
 How'd it go? 
 Meh. 
 Jason Birk's alibi checks out. 
 How about you? What do you got? 
 I've been looking into Barb's employment records, and get this, she's had 25 employees in the last year alone. 
 Wow, that's a revolving door. 
 Yeah, but that's not even the good part. 
 I found this one guy, Ross Simpson, Hmm. he got fired from the diner 18 months ago, and now he owns a food truck, Mom's Grilled Cheese. 
 Oh, so he's giving Barb some competition. 
 Yeah, but there's more. 
 Jason's assault? 
 Is from when he attacked Ross' food truck. 
 Making him a person of interest. 
 Well, do we know where Ross is now? 
 Most food trucks post where they're gonna be every day. 
 Yeah, she would know. 
 Of course I know. 
 Well, Mom's Grilled Cheese parks outside of Barb's diner every Monday. 
 Wow, I bet Barb loved that. 
 How about today, where is he? 
 Main and 6th. 
 You feel like some grilled cheese? 
 More lunch. 
 Here we go. 
 You want one? 
 Uh... no. 
 What the hell is this? 
 Grilled cheese special with fries. 
 Oh, well, the customer said it was greasy and disgusting. 
 There's nothing wrong with that grilled cheese sandwich, mom. 
 Then eat it. 
 Eat it. 
 Clearly, Ross isn't the only one trying to put us out of business. 
 He's parked outside again? 
 Uh-huh. 
 Big line of customers. 
 Our customers, because of you. 
 It won't happen again. 
 Well, I wish that I could believe that, but you're a screw-up, just like your dad. 
 Hey... it's nothing I haven't heard before. 
 Yeah? 
 Been there, ran away from that. 
 I split off when I was 15. 
 Some people just... wanna hurt you. 
 You know, and if you stick around long enough, you start to think that's love. 
 You want to tell us what happened with Jason Birk? 
 Yeah, he smashed up my truck and he broke my ribs. 
 And he's got the nerve to say I'm trying to put them out of business? 
 But aren't you, though? 
 Hey, it's not my fault that my customers think my food tastes better. There ya go. 
 What did Barb think about your truck? 
 Barb? She hated it. 
 She probably put Jason up to the whole thing. 
 I doubt the kid's had a thought in his head she didn't have first. 
 You know, I used to feel sorry for him. 
 You're still parking in front of the diner. 
 Yeah, but now I only do it on Mondays, because I know that Barb's not going to be there. 
 Well, you've got the whole city. Why are you parking there? 
 You've seen the construction sites down there? 
 Vega : Mm-hmm. 
 I can't afford to pass up that business. 
 Where were you this morning at 6:00 AM? 
 I had a breakfast service on the West Side. 
 We do this, uh, charity for cancer every year. 
 Started my prep at 4:00 AM. 
 Okay, thank you very much, sir. 
 No, wait, wait, wait, I got a sandwich coming. 
 Hold on. 
 Gorgonzola and pear. 
 Thank you. 
 Thank you. Ah... 
 All right, so we know that Barb wasn't at the diner on Monday. 
 Yeah, she was there, though, today. 
 Didn't Dean say that she was running late for something? 
 Yeah, he did. 
 Maybe she was meeting someone. 
 Let's find out who. 
 Sasha, are you okay? 
 They think I stole your pick-up. 
 You're the friend? 
 Yes. 
 Sasha works at the women's shelter that I'm staying at. 
 Which is why I couldn't tell you her name. 
 I need to see some ID. 
 Maya Bureen? 
 If you look at the registration, you'll see my name on there. 
 The truck's not stolen. 
 Well, your husband filed a report. 
 He give you that black eye? 
 Okay. 
 We won't press charges, but I still have to write up an incident report. 
 Ta. 
 Thanks. 
 They didn't have honey. 
 You didn't even ask, did you? 
 I totally forgot. 
 One for me too? 
 Yeah, one for you too. What did I miss? 
 Uh, Brian's got the LUDs back from Barb Birk's phone. 
 Shed any light on who she was talking to this morning? 
 She made a call at 5:50 AM. 
 Which is promising. 
 Yeah, who'd she call? 
 A burner cell. 
 It was purchased at a convenience store two weeks ago. 
 Paid by cash. 
 So no way to figure out who bought it. 
 Wait a minute, there is... there is one way. 
 What's the cell number? 
 [Dialing] 
 [Cell phone rings] 
 You gonna get that? 
 Hello? 
 Hello. Who am I speaking with? 
 Who is this? 
 Uh, this is Detective Angie Flynn. Who's this? 
 Wrong number. 
 Hung up. 
 Female voice, though, so at least we know Barb was talking to a woman this morning. 
 A woman who doesn't want to talk to cops. 
 Uh-huh. 
 I don't know, burning someone alive doesn't exactly sound like something a woman would do. 
 Depends on the woman. 
 You okay? 
 Thanks for coming to get me. 
 Look, I know it's none of my business, and you're welcome to use the truck... 
 Can we please just not talk about it right now? 
 Mm-hm. 
 If you do ever want to talk about it... 
 Thanks. 
 Sure. 
 You don't have to let her talk to you like that, you know. 
 She doesn't mean it. 
 She gets upset. 
 Yeah, just like my dad didn't mean it when he'd get drunk and turn psycho. 
 Mom's not like that. 
 I'm all she has. 
 What about your dad? 
 He left when I was eight. 
 It's been the two of us ever since. 
 Sometimes I think about leaving. 
 Well, you could, you know. 
 Go someplace better. 
 And, uh... is that where you went? 
 I don't know. 
 Is this better? 
 I had to remove the jawbone in order to get the dental impression, but this is definitely Barb Birk. 
 I was hoping you'd have more for me. 
 Oh, I do. 
 I x-rayed the body. 
 Oh, good, show and tell. 
 Contusion to the skull. 
 Is that our cause of death? 
 No, the fire definitely killed her. 
 Smoke inhalation. 
 But the good news is with a fracture like this, she was probably unconscious. 
 So she was knocked out first? 
 Mmm, the angle of impact is more consistent with a fall. 
 Maybe pushed? 
 Mmm... 
 Vega : Okay, so our victim meets with someone... 
 They have a confrontation. 
 Barb ends up unconscious. 
 Then the killer starts the fire. 
 Did we get anything back on the lighter? 
 No, it was too scorched to find any fingerprints. 
 Didn't Jason say that anyone who worked at the diner knew where the lighter was? 
 That's right, and we know it was a woman that answered the burner cell. 
 So let's interview Barb's current female employees. 
 Okay. Hey, why don't we take my car for once? 
 Um... no. 
 Aw, you're killing me. 
 [Laughs] 
 Your car smells like gorgonzola and pear. 
 Yeah, that's why we are taking it. 
 [Vega laughs] 
 Barb shouting : Ross, you son of a bitch! 
 Get out of here! 
 I want you off my property now. 
 Ross : Barb, this isn't your property. 
 Barb : This is pathetic. What are you doing here? 
 Oh, man... 
 Me? What am I doing? 
 I fired your ass months ago! 
 I quit, Barb. 
 These are my customers. That's your property. 
 You're delusional. You know what? I'm calling the city. 
 Bye, Barb, thanks for the pep talk. 
 He has the nerve to park right out front. 
 Now he says he's going to call the health department on us. 
 Mom, I'll take care of it. 
 No, don't. I'll do it myself, like everything else around here. 
 Jason, whoa! Whoa, wait! 
 Wait, look... 
 Hey! 
 Jason's going after Ross. OK? He has a bat. 
 Jason, what are you doing? 
 What are you doing? 
 Great. Another mess I'm going to have to clean up. 
 Look, he's doing this for you. 
 Well, I didn't ask him to. 
 What are you doing, man? 
 Barb, you can stop this, okay? 
 [Smashing and shouting] 
 Ross : No... 
 Calm down! 
 You can't coddle stupidity. 
 How's he going to learn? 
 Hey! What are you doing, man? 
 You can stop this. You can stop this! 
 He's gonna hurt somebody! 
 Well, at least the truck will finally be gone. 
 What kind of mother are you? 
 Jason, stop it! 
 Stop! Stop! 
 [Kicks thudding heavily] 
 Stop! 
 Jason! Stop! 
 Jason, leave him alone! 
 Please! Stop it! 
 Jason! Stop! 
 
 
 
 Woman : Wow, what a mess. 
 Melissa, did you know where the lighter was kept? 
 Of course I knew where the lighter was kept. 
 Everyone who worked at the diner did. 
 And where were you at 6:00 AM this morning? 
 At my other job, at a bakery downtown. 
 You can ask my boss. 
 Can you think of anyone who'd want to hurt Barb? 
 It's okay. 
 We're just trying to get a complete picture here. 
 She could be... intense. 
 Can you elaborate on "Intense"? 
 She was a micro-manager. 
 She practically wanted to be in your apron with you, doing everything herself. 
 Which is why it was weird when she started leaving me alone in the diner. 
 Started leaving you alone? 
 When? 
 The last month or so? 
 She'd take off during lunch rush, and that's our busiest time. 
 She say why? 
 No, but it was like clockwork. 
 Every Wednesday and Friday, for two hours. 
 She kept very quiet about it. 
 Okay. 
 Well, thank you, thanks for your help. 
 Sounds like Barb was a piece of work. 
 Hmm. 
 Okay, so... what was so important that a control freak would leave work? 
 At the busiest time. 
 Yeah, without telling anyone. 
 [Sucking teeth] Sounds like Barb had a secret. 
 So yesterday morning, when your mom came to see you, you don't know why she wanted you to go to the diner with her? 
 I told you, I didn't speak to her. 
 Well, we think she was meeting someone. 
 So you have any idea who that might have been? 
 No idea. 
 Okay, what about Wednesdays and Fridays. 
 You have any idea why she was leaving the diner on those days at lunch? 
 That's rush hour. 
 She wouldn't. 
 She did. 
 Can't think of anywhere she'd go? 
 Aren't you guys listening? We weren't talking! 
 Young man, I need you to calm down. 
 [Sighing] 
 I should have talked to her. 
 We're just trying to help you. 
 I don't know where she was going. 
 Lucas : Her phone was destroyed in the fire. 
 [Groaning] 
 Maybe she used the cloud to back things up. 
 And you know about the cloud? 
 Manny keeps trying to get me to use it. 
 Well, he's a smart boy. You should use it. 
 Okay, we're in. 
 And it does looks like Barb used some sort of calendar. 
 Oh, but nothing on Wednesdays and Fridays. 
 Not for the last six months. 
 But Jason was right, though. 
 Barb pretty much used her phone for everything else. 
 Okay, what's so important that it's worth leaving work at the busiest time for her? 
 But not worth tracking on her phone? 
 Mm-hm. 
 Maybe she did. 
 Let me take a look at this. 
 [Sobbing] 
 [Sobbing] 
 Hey, you crept up on me. 
 Would you like me to do something about that hair? 
 Yeah? Come here. 
 [Sighs shakily] 
 Jason! 
 What are you doing here? 
 I couldn't let you go in there without saying goodbye. 
 You were right, you know? 
 I should have listened to you that... that day with Ross. 
 We all make mistakes. 
 Yeah, well, this one's gonna cost me a year of my life. 
 Are you gonna come back and visit? 
 Take care of yourself in there, okay? 
 That looks delicious. 
 Yeah, Koshi's, on second. 
 I should check it out. 
 You should. 
 Hey, is Angie around? 
 I've been trying to get a hold of her, but I get the sense she's dodging me. 
 Okay, well, you know, we're working on a big case, so... 
 Let her know I want to talk to her. 
 I want to start prepping her testimony. 
 Okay. Hey, what's the... what's the rush? 
 I mean, she hasn't said yes to you, has she? 
 Well, why wouldn't she? 
 Her testimony is crucial to the biggest case in the city. 
 70 convictions are on the line. 
 Oh. 
 Is there something I don't know about? 
 I don't know, Samantha. 
 I don't know, you're gonna... you're gonna have to ask Angie. 
 Let her know I want to talk to her, will you? 
 Will do. I'll pass that on. 
 Good night. 
 Good night. 
 Can I ask you a question? 
 Of course. 
 Is it about the case you're working? 
 Uh, no. 
 Let's say you have a friend, and that friend has been asked to testify for a former partner as a character witness. 
 A friend? 
 Come on, Angie, it's me. 
 Yeah, but I'm trying to protect you, so just go with it. 
 Now, this friend knows things that she doesn't want to say. 
 And she and the cop in question have a history of playing things fast and loose. 
 It sounds like my friend's in a tough spot. 
 Should she testify? 
 Is she worried her testimony will sway the jury against the prosecution? 
 Yes. 
 Could it ruin the other officer's career? 
 I don't know. 
 Will her testimony ruin her career? 
 I don't know. 
 Angie... you gotta do what's gonna let you sleep at night. 
 It took me a little while, but this is what I found. 
 Every Wednesday and Friday of last month, Barb used the camera on her phone. 
 It geo-tags the photos? 
 Exactly. 
 That's Emery Barnes Park. 
 I used to take Manny there when he was little. 
 Yeah, but what was Barbara Birk doing there, right? 
 These were the last photos that she took. 
 Hmm. Who is this guy? 
 I don't know, but he's in every one of those photos. 
 Hmmm. Looks like we've got a Mr. Wednesday and Friday. 
 Yeah, but what does he have to do with Barb? 
 Well, it's Wednesday afternoon, you wanna go find out? 
 Do you recognize that man? 
 Oh, sure, that's Brett. 
 He usually comes here every week for family time in the park. 
 Family time is like a... like a Mommy-and-Me group? 
 Like an "Any Kind of Family You Got" group. 
 We meet here every Wednesday and Friday at 1:00. 
 Have you seen him lately? 
 Not this week. 
 But I think he lives around here. 
 I run into him and his son at the coffee shop sometimes. 
 Okay. Great. Thanks very much. 
 Have a good day. 
 Hmm. 
 Local park, local shops? 
 Yay, you know what that means. 
 More canvassing. 
 Your favorite. 
 I'm sorry I didn't come and visit you. 
 I'm glad you didn't see me in there. 
 Yeah, I, uh... 
 I heard the news about your mom. 
 I'm so sorry. 
 I just can't believe she's gone. 
 It's so messed up. 
 Look, I, um, I sent you a few emails, and... 
 Did you get them? 
 No, she, um... 
 I had to change my accounts. 
 Barb didn't... tell you anything? 
 About what? 
 About us. 
 We weren't talking. 
 I cut... I cut ties with her a couple months into my sentence. 
 They had me talking to this therapist, and he said I needed a fresh start. 
 I wish I hadn't listened to him. 
 Why? 
 Because all she ever did was do the best for me. 
 Jason, Barb is the reason that you went to jail. 
 That was my mistake, not hers. 
 All she ever did was try. 
 And that's why I'm going to find the b*st*rd who killed her. 
 I have to go. 
 Wait, wait, wait. 
 I want to see you again. 
 I'm sorry, I can't be with you. 
 Sasha, no... 
 We, uh... stopped going to the park recently. 
 Why, what happened? 
 Well, I take my son to family time while my wife does yoga, but last week, when I walked Evan back, she noticed a truck driving behind us. 
 Like following you? 
 Yeah. 
 You remember what the truck looked like? 
 Yeah, it was black, a woman driver. 
 Was this the driver? 
 No, I... 
 I really didn't see her. 
 But ever since we brought the new baby back home, my wife's been worrying about everything. 
 Honestly, I thought she was just being paranoid, but... but now... 
 You know, I think she wrote down the license plate number. 
 Great. 
 Thank you. 
 Yeah. 
 So the plates belong to a Brad and Maya Bureen. 
 The truck was reported stolen seven days ago, and it was pulled over the day of the fire right here. 
 Okay, well, that's... that's not far from the diner. 
 Who was driving? 
 A Sasha King. 
 We only have her name and her address from the report, but she was released from custody six hours later. 
 She posted bail? 
 No. Maya Bureen, the owner of the truck, she came in and said that the truck wasn't stolen, but in fact, she loaned it to her friend, Sasha. 
 Hmm. 
 Sasha king, why are you and Barb  both obsessed with Brett Huntley? 
 Sasha King, age 19. 
 She lives and works at the Eastside Women's Center. 
 She has for about a year. 
 She was arrested on the day of the murder in a stolen truck near the crime scene. 
 Yeah, that same truck has been seen following the guy that Barb was taking photos of on Wednesdays and Fridays. 
 Yeah, but you said Brett Huntley didn't recognize her picture, so what's the connection between the three? 
 Sasha King worked at the diner 10 months ago. 
 Yeah, and with so many ex-employees, she didn't really stand out until we found the truck. 
 All right, find out what she's hiding. 
 Look, I told the other officer, the whole stolen truck thing was just a big mix-up. 
 This isn't just about the stolen truck. 
 Yeah, we're homicide detectives. 
 Homicide? 
 Mm-hm. 
 Mm-hm. 
 Let's start here. 
 Do you recognize this man? 
 Nope. 
 No. Well, he says that he saw Maya Bureen's truck following him last week. 
 It wasn't me. 
 Oh, somebody else, then? 
 Oh, I mean, it could've been anyone. 
 Maya lets people borrow her truck all the time, you know, to run errands and stuff. 
 You were running errands when you got pulled over? 
 Like I said, the whole stolen truck thing was just a big mix... 
 Just one big mix-up. No, we heard you. 
 So why were you near the diner the morning of the fire? 
 Oh, I was actually getting groceries for the shelter. 
 I work in the kitchen. 
 Oh. 
 You also worked in the kitchen of Barb's all-day diner, didn't you? 
 Yeah, we uh... we found your name in Barb's employment records. 
 Yeah. Yeah, that's right, but, uh, that was last year, so... 
 And you left after a few months? 
 That's around the time you started working at the shelter, isn't it? 
 Did you and Barb keep in touch? 
 No. 
 Well. 
 I guess this has just... it's just been a big mix-up. 
 Yeah. 
 Do you have a cell phone we can use? 
 In case we have any other questions? 
 No. 
 Just... just the shelter's number. 
 Okay. Cool. 
 We'll be in touch. 
 Thank you. 
 Sasha lives and works in a women's shelter. 
 Everything about that place is designed to protect the women on the inside. 
 The phone number's unlisted, right? 
 Yeah, but the women are given burner cells for personal use, just like the one that Barb called before she was killed. 
 Can we prove it belongs to Sasha? 
 Burner phones are unregistered. 
 That's the whole point. 
 What about outgoing calls? 
 Hmm, that's a good point. 
 Lucas, see if you can find the outgoing calls on the burner cell? 
 So we see the phone calls, maybe we link it to Sasha. 
 Exactly. 
 Here it is. 
 Whoever had this burner number barely used it. 
 What's that number? [Clears throat] 
 She called it nine times in the last four months. 
 Mm-hm. 
 [Typing] 
 It's an adoption agency. 
 This is interesting. 
 Sasha king gave up a baby for adoption two months ago. 
 Do we know who adopted the baby? 
 Well, the adoption agency won't give that information out without a warrant. 
 Okay, well, while you're at it, why don't we see if we can get a warrant for Sasha's emails. 
 You got it. 
 Thank you, sir. 
 Look at these. 
 These photos that Barb took of Brett Huntley. 
 Brett Huntley's in them, but so is someone else. 
 Right, the Huntleys' new baby. 
 Mm-hmm. 
 Baby looks about two months old. 
 Yeah, so the Huntleys' baby could be Sasha's son? 
 What does this have to do with Barb? 
 Jason. 
 Yeah, he worked with Sasha before he went to prison. 
 Exactly. 
 Maybe that's what all this is about. 
 Sasha's son is Barb's grandson. 
 I know this looks scary, but we are trying to help. 
 [Sighing] So, you went to the crisis center because you were pregnant with nowhere else to go, right? 
 How did you know that? 
 [Sighs] 
 Because we have your email, and the ultrasound picture that you tried to send Jason. 
 Yeah, you wanted to tell him that he was going to be a father. 
 But he didn't receive that, did he? 
 We know that Barb read his emails. 
 Barb, no! 
 Look, I'm not... I'm not keeping the baby, okay? 
 I'm giving it up for adoption. 
 You can't do that. 
 I beg your pardon? 
 This is my grandchild. 
 Look, I-I am in no position to be a mother. 
 Okay, this is what's best for him. 
 Sasha, I'm already a mother, okay? 
 I can raise your son. 
 Yeah, just like you raised Jason? 
 Jason was not my fault, all right? 
 His dad stuck around just long enough to screw him up, but this time will be different. 
 This isn't about you, okay? 
 This is... this is about the baby. 
 I'll fight you. I'll do whatever it takes. 
 I promise you, that baby will be mine. 
 I wanted my baby to have a good home. 
 Hmm. Well, that must have been really hard, giving him up like that... 
 [Gently] Sasha... the Huntleys are waiting. 
 Do you want five more minutes? 
 No. 
 No, if I don't give him now, I... 
 I won't be able to. 
 [Baby crying] 
 [Baby's cries echo] 
 That's why you started following the Huntleys. 
 I had to make sure he was okay. 
 Mm-hm. 
 Angie : You didn't expect her to follow you there. 
 But she did. 
 Well, we looked in Barb's calendar, Genetic relatives have up to two years to contest an adoption. That's why she wanted to meet you, isn't it? She wanted you to sign those papers. Have you relinquish your parental rights. She wanted your son. I was never gonna let that happen. It's not about money. I told you I would never sign these. Look, I'm not Jason, okay? You can't bully me. That baby is the only family I have left. You are a horrible mother. He belongs with me. He deserves so much better than you. Listen to me, you bitch, I'm going to get him back no matter what it takes. Leave us alone! Psycho! [Head thuds heavily] Barb? Barb ruined Jason's life. I couldn't let her ruin another. What about Jason? He's the father. If Jason had the baby... Barb would have him too. He would do anything for her. [Gas hissing] I killed to protect my son. Jason... I'm so sorry. I just want to know. Is he in a good home? Better than you or I ever had. [Slurring] Hey... we gotta... we gotta get another one now. Thank you. Laughing : Thank you. Okay, to what now? How many years we've been partners? Ah, we've been partners five years. Five years, partner. Salut? Salut. [Both wincing] Those were five good years. Nice. Okay. Okay... so, you wanna talk about what happened? What are you talking about? A girl can't take her favorite partner out for several shots of bourbon? Anytime. [Laughing] How about this, let's start with this, what's your deal with Samantha? I don't have a problem with Samantha. You don't? No. Okay, so, uh... your... your testimony? Listen, Angie, I don't get it. I've read the file on you and Cross. What am I missing? What am I missing, right? Because Alfonso Dyer, he's a drug addict. He takes his girlfriend and their kid hostage, and then he shoots her right in front of you. Right? Mm-hm. Mm-hm. So I shot him. I was saving that kid's life. Yeah, that's... that's in the file. Yup. He was shot twice. I shot him in the heart, Cross shot him in the shoulder. Well, that's also in the report, Mm-hmm. that Dyer shot first, it was a justified shooting. I, uh... I lied to the judiciary committee. Hey, can we get another round? Angie. Mm-hmm? I'm here for you, you know that, if you need me. I do know that. You're a good man.
