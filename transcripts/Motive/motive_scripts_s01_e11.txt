 Claire? 
 Did you know Al Capone's brother was a cop? 
 His name was James Vincenzo Capone. 
 Uh-huh. 
 And, in order to hide the relationship, he changed his name to Richard James Hart and he became a Federal Prohibition Officer. 
 They called him "Two-Gun" Hart. 
 Joey, I'm working. 
 Hey. Just check it out. 
 I mean, the guy should be just as famous as his brother, and nobody knows who he is. 
 Hey! [Bangs bar] 
 You got customers over here! 
 Relax, buddy. It's just a beer. 
 Are you telling me what to do? 
 No, but I am. 
 If you know what's good for you, you'll get out of here. 
 That's okay, Beth. 
 I can handle this. 
 Oh, can you? 
 Yeah. 
 Hey! Hey! 
 Hey! 
 Now give me that beer. 
 It's your funeral. 
 Beth asked me to call you.

 So you like bullying women and guys in wheelchairs, huh? 
 What, you mean the skank and the gimp? 
 "Just as much as we see in others, we have in ourselves." 
 What's that supposed to mean? 
 It means I feel sorry for you. 
 Well, I feel sorry for you. 
 [Grunts] 
 [Groans] 
 You telegraph your punches. 
 [Cries out] 
 Look. Try short, controlled jabs. 
 All right? 
 Short, controlled jabs. 
 Block with your arms! 
 [Groans] 
 I said block! 
 [Thug cringes, then groans] 
 You're not blocking. 
 Okay, okay! 
 Okay. 
 Some people never learn.

 Hey. Where's the guy who found the body? 
 We've got him in the office. 
 Okay. I'll be right there. 
 ♪ 
 Well, hello. 
 Hey. 
 Where's Detective Lucas? 
 Date night, which you and I know I do not have, so I said I'd cover for him. 
 Do you know that my first husband tried to save our marriage with date nights? 
 And what happened? 
 I met my second husband. 
 Well, that's one way to do it. 
 God, if I had a dollar for every guy who asks to play with my handcuffs... 
 [Chuckles] I'd only have a few bucks. 
 Well, I'd be rich. 
 Who's this? 
 This is Mark "Machine" Mason. 
 Stabbed twice in the back. 
 Body is still warm. Rigor hasn't even set in yet. 
 This is recent. Very recent. 
 I'm thinking between 10:00 and 10:30. 
 The weapon was sharp and hollow. 
 Probably homemade. 
 Definitely homicide. 
 Well, so much for going out with you. 
 Raincheque? 
 You know it. 
 [Dials phone] 
 Hey, Vega? It's Ange. 
 We got one. 
 [Beeps phone off] 
 Hi. I'm Detective Flynn. I heard you found the body.

 I don't believe it. 
 I can't believe my brother's dead.

 Mark was on the floor when I came in. 
 Uh... he wasn't breathing and I called the ambulance. 
 Vega : Take your time. 
 Was the door open when you got here? 
 The gym door is always locked. 
 You got to be buzzed in if you don't have a key. 
 You know who has keys? 
 All of our fighters. 
 Me. Beth. 
 Oh, God, Beth. 
 I have to tell her. 
 Can I go? 
 We just need a minute more of your time. 
 Yeah. We're gonna need a list of everyone with keys. 
 Those guys are like family to us. 
 Of course, which is why we need to speak to them. 
 They could maybe help us find the person who did this. 
 Can you think of anyone who might want to hurt your brother? 
 Sighing : Uh... 
 Last week, some no-neck came into Beth's bar, started causing trouble, but Mark sorted him out. 
 He didn't come back around? 
 Actually, he signed up for a year-long membership. 
 That was Mark, you know? 
 He'd kick your ass, but you'd still want to be his friend. 
 I'm sorry, guys. 
 I just can't stop thinking about Beth, Mark's wife. 
 Yeah, of course. Thank you. 
 Thank you. 
 Hey, Angie. 
 Angie. 
 All right, so this is Mark Mason versus Joe Wilson. 
 Now, everybody thought that Mason was gonna lose. 
 I mean, everybody thought. 
 Mason shatters Wilson's jaw. 
 I mean, you got to check this thing out online. 
 The entire fight lasts 15 seconds. 
 I did not know you were such a boxing fan. 
 Well, he was more than just a fighter. 
 Golden Gloves, Olympics... 
 You name it, he won it. 
 He retired undefeated. 
 Somebody broke that streak. 
 Hey. 
 Anything? 
 Yeah, I've got this. 
 Carl Gordon signed in at 9:00 P.M., but didn't sign out. 
 He's on the list. He's got his own key. 
 And Dr. Rogers puts the time of death between 10:00 and 10:30. 
 All right, Mr. Gordon, let's rumble.

 You call that a punch? 
 I don't want to hurt your girlfriend. 
 Aw, that's all right. She's got a twin. 
 Oh, is that right? 
 That's right. 
 All right, put 'em here. 
 There it is. 
 JC Square. 
 You know, I've been thinking. 
 Well, that's never a good sign. 
 We should start a yoga class. 
 Yoga? 
 Yeah. 
 Look around you, man. We ain't set up for yoga. 
 All we would need is open space and some mirrors on the wall, and I don't know if you've noticed, but we've got a lot of open space. 
 If people want to do yoga, they should go to a yoga studio, all right? 
 Stop talkin' out your ass and let's do this, huh? 
 What about boxercise? 
 Boxercise? 
 Yeah. It's like boxing aerobics. 
 I know what boxercise is, man! 
 Check it. Check it. 
 We got three classes a week, all right? 
 We got 30 people per class, free for members, $10 for drop-ins. 
 You could even teach a class. 
 [Smack] 
 This is a boxing gym. 
 A boxing gym that can generate extra revenue with exercise classes.

 My knee's killing me. 
 So that's a no? 
 That's great. 
 I love these talks, Mark.

 I don't care how thirsty you are. 
 I'm not risking my liquor licence. 
 Beth. 
 Joey, there's always... 
 Beth! 
 Mark's dead. 
 Joey, that's not funny. 
 I wish I was kidding.

 Someone came into the gym and he stabbed him. 
 Police are over there right now. 
 [Shuddering gasp, Beth starts weeping] 
 I'm here.

 Vega : Well, according to the sign-in sheet, you were at the gym tonight. 
 Yeah, it's the only time I get to train. 
 My wife works days, so I cook dinner for her and the kids, before hitting the gym, then on to work. 
 What time did you get there? 
 Around 9:00. 
 "Machine" showed up about a half-hour later. 
 He told me he needed the place to himself. 
 Did he say why he needed it to himself? 
 Nah. That was none of my business. 
 And how was he when he got there? 
 Was he happy? Or agitated? Angry? 
 He was Machine. 
 Well, how was he as a trainer? 
 He made me run the seawall backwards with steel-toed boots on. 
 Spar wearing an eye-patch to mimic a black eye. 
 Sounds intense. 
 I can't complain with the results, I mean... 
 I'm 12 and 0. 
 I-I gotta... I gotta go. 
 I gotta get back to the club. 
 Hey, can you think of anyone who would argue with the results? 
 Machine and "Bam-Bam" had a falling out. 
 Bam-Bam? 
 Yeah. Ricky "Bam-Bam" Perez. 
 Well, maybe Machine and Ricky got together to patch things up? 
 Nah. Machine didn't have a reverse gear. 
 Vega and Flynn : Thanks. 
 I'm not shilling no protein powder. 
 It's not shilling. It's endorsing. 
 Why would I endorse it? 
 Protein powder don't make you a champion. 
 It doesn't not make you a champion. 
 Look, it's easy. 
 Okay, you do a couple of photo shoots, maybe a few public appearances, maybe an infomercial. 
 Put your name on the label. 
 What, you want me endorse something I'd never use, huh? 
 Lots of athletes endorse products they don't use. 
 This... is a lie. 
 I don't lie. 
 If you sign this contract, we don't have to worry about our lease! 
 I'm not worried about the lease. 
 I am! 
 That's why you're here. 
 You handle the business. 
 I handle the boxers. 
 Look. 
 I know we're having some cash-flow problems, but this, this isn't the solution. 
 Then what is? 
 You figure it out. 
 I got faith in you, knucklehead. 
 Thanks, dumbass. 
 ♪ 
 Angie : Carl Gordon says that you and Mark had a falling out. 
 I wouldn't call it a falling out. 
 Machine had this whack theory that money perverted the purity of the sport. 
 I wasn't interested in some vow of poverty, so we parted ways. 
 It was your idea to part ways? 
 Olympic Gold don't mean much when all you've got to show for it is a dump of a gym and a second-hand pick-up truck. 
 You know, Mr. Mason seemed pretty happy with his accomplishments. 
 He was the only one. 
 Joey busted his ass to keep that place running, and all he's got to show for it is a lifetime of soft-serve, you know what I'm saying? 
 I think I do. 
 And what kind of man lets his wife pay his bills? 
 One who knows that marriage is a partnership? 
 [Snickers] 
 Between that and changing Joey's piss-bag, I'm surprised she hung around as long as she has. 
 I see. 
 So maybe you're her knight in shining armour? 
 I don't need to raid another man's henhouse. 
 And you were nowhere near Machine's gym last night? 
 Let's say between 8:00 and midnight. 
 I was with my new manager. 
 Paul Sanders. 
 Here's his number... 
 And here's my number. 
 Well, thank you very much. 
 Bam-Bam : Any time, sweetheart.

 Now we know why they call him "Bam-Bam."

 Thanks, babe. 
 Mm. 
 What's this? 
 Mark : Oh, pfft. That's Joey's latest pitch. 
 Franchises. 
 Well, I hope you told him no. 
 Oh, you're not actually considering this? 
 I've shot down so many of his ideas lately. 
 Because he's trying to make you into something you're not. 
 Look at this. Look. 
 You are a boxing gym, okay? 
 You are not a fast-food restaurant. 
 You know, you got a little... A little something. 
 Did I get it? 
 No. It's still there. It's just...

 Don't move, all right? 
 Beth, call 911. 
 I said I'm fine! 
 Don't move, all right? 
 [Stifled scream] 
 Oh, God. 
 So Mark told Carl Gordon last night that he needed the gym for a private meeting. 
 Any idea who that was with? 
 That would be me. 
 You live with him. 
 Why are you meeting at the gym? 
 Ever since the accident, Joey's been living with us. 
 We weren't getting much personal time. 
 We were trying to get pregnant. 
 Ahh. I see. 
 And now, what time did you leave the gym? 
 About 10:00? 
 I only had a half-hour.

 I hate it when suspects have alibis. 
 Yeah, I didn't do much better.

 If you want to know if anything's stolen, wouldn't it be easier to just go to the gym? 
 It's still an active crime scene. 
 Yeah, about that. 
 Uh... 
 Hate to sound callous, but how long do you think we'll have to stay closed? 
 Well, we should be able to release it tonight. 
 In the meantime, we were hoping you wouldn't mind taking a look at these photos and telling us if anything's missing. 
 Okay. 
 Well, all the equipment looks like it's there. 
 Unless they stole towels. 
 [Sighing] Man... 
 The gold medals are missing. 
 So those weren't in a safe? 
 No, they're not. Mark... man! 
 Aw, damn it. 
 I told him not to put them on display. 
 It's definitely tempting. 
 When I arrived last night, there was someone in the alley. 
 He's always back there. He was rooting through trash.

 Thanks, man. 
 Get yourself something to eat. 
 You wanted to talk? 
 Yeah. 
 I'm dropping Perez from the roster. 
 That's a bad idea. 
 It's not a debate. I'm telling you this out of courtesy. 
 Last time I checked, this was a partnership, which means we have to agree on every business decision. 
 I don't like the way he's looking at Beth. 
 [Laughs] That's it? 
 That's my wife and your sister-in-law we're talking about. 
 That's right, and this is a business, not a clubhouse. 
 You don't like the way he's looking at her, then you tell him, but we've invested too much in Perez just to drop him! 
 Damn it, Joey! Why's it always gotta be about money with you? 
 Why is it never about money with you? 
 Perez is good!

 He's gone. 
 No, he's not.

 Okay. So, sometime between 10 and 10:30, the killer breaks in the back, stabs Mark, steals the medals, then leaves. 
 Are you thinking what I'm thinking? 
 How does a transient get the jump on a professional boxer? 
 Apparently not, because I was thinking we should go to the pawnshops. Lucas? 
 This stab wound damaged the liver. 
 He'd have been in pain, but he would've survived it. 
 This is the one that killed him. 
 The weapon sliced the common iliac artery. 
 He bled out quickly. 
 The weapon looks like some kind of shiv. 
 Yeah. A shiv with a hilt. 
 Both wounds have the exact same depth. 
 It doesn't explain why someone got the drop on him. 
 That is probably the knee. 
 Makes sense. 
 The killer knows that Mason's left knee is compromised from a previous injury. 
 He sneaks up, hits it, then stabs him. 
 "Hits it"? 
 That's a bit of understatement. 
 Look at this. 
 That knee was pulverized.

I just want to thank everybody for their kind words, their cards, emails. It's nice to know that Mark touched so many hearts. And the police? I want to thank them most of a... I got to buy a suit. I have some work to do. Joey, have they told you, do they have any leads? Unfortunately, I'm not at liberty to divulge that information. Well, we appreciate you taking the time. Now, I contacted the police myself, but they declined to comment on the progress of the case, excep... Aw, he's a slippery one, this one. Or, if I were the devil's advocate, he's innocent. He found his brother's body. He lied about the homeless guy in the alley. He stole those medals to make it look like a robbery. I think he killed his brother. Well, if he did, it wasn't for the money. There's no love connection between him and Beth. I just... I don't see Joey Mason killing his brother. Why? Because they're brothers, or because he's in a wheelchair? Little bit of both, actually. Anyone's capable of murder, especially family. How about Cain and Abel? Remember them? Well, Cain killed Abel because of envy. Joey Mason shared in his brother's success and his failure. What are the other sins from that movie? Or from the Bible. Wow. Lust. Gluttony. Greed. Wrath. Sloth. Pride. That one. Pride. This one likes to be the centre of attention, doesn't he? ♪ Angie : Hey, news guy. Detective Flynn. Your message was cryptic. But it worked. Here you are. Without camera. As requested. Thank you. Listen. I could get into a lot of trouble if anybody knew that I was talking to you, so this has to be off the record. Okay? Why are you talking to me? When I called you for a comment the other day, all I got was a dial tone. Ah. "A source inside the police, who wishes to remain anonymous." Mm. Because of your report, we recovered Mason's medals. You cannot report that. We have identified the man that Joey Mason saw outside the gym the night of his brother's murder. What's his name? I can't tell you that. He's a person of interest right now. But an arrest is imminent, and that you can report. ♪ Thanks for the tip. ♪ Joey! Joey, they have a suspect. What? Who? They won't say, but they're expecting to make an arrest soon. Like, it's all over the news! I thought that they might. They asked me to look at a photo line-up. I guess I helped more than I thought. Wait! What... what? Why didn't you tell me? After everything you've been through, I didn't want, uh, didn't want you get your hopes up. Oh, Joey. Joey, I owe you an apology. For what? I haven't been the best sister-in-law lately. Beth, you're talking crazy. No. I... Things have been so much harder since your accident. You know, money was tight. Everything was just different.  And then, what happened with Mark, I... I just... I started to blame you for it. [Stammers] You actually thought that I could kill Mark? [Laughs] Joey... [Sighs] Mark would be so proud of you, I mean, the way you've stepped up to the plate. ♪ [Chair creaks] ♪ You know, people used to ask me how it felt to live in Mark's shadow... I don't know... Because I always felt like I was basking in his glow. ♪ Mark didn't believe in compromise, and he never doubted his beliefs. An obstacle was nothing more than a challenge to him. Telling the press we had a suspect is a bit of a hail Mary, don't you think? When I broke... Well, you saw how slippery he was with that photo line-up. Only way we're gonna get him is by lulling him into a false sense of security. Mark was the one that showed me that I still have so much more to live for. There's something different about him. Yeah. He thinks he got away with murder. The kind of guy we should all try and aspire to be. There's something else. That I always wanted to be. A man I was so very proud to know. Mark was my brother and he was my hero. I looked up to him... even before I was in this... this chair. We're going to need a search warrant. ♪ [Joey sobs] I think I know where the murder weapon is. ♪ This is Mark's funeral. We realize it's an inconvenience, but time's of the essence. We won't be able to arrest Mark's killer without your help, so, I'm sorry. Joey, you don't have to do this. You said that Mark would be proud of me for stepping up to the plate. This is me stepping up to the plate. ( ♪ ) Okay. She's gone. What we're about to tell you is privileged information. Vega : Nobody can know. Flynn : We've analyzed all the evidence from Mark's murder, and there's no way a stranger killed your brother. Your brother was killed by someone who knew him. It's the only way someone could get close enough to him. And you don't have to protect her anymore. P-protect her? Yeah. We know it was Beth. Beth? Oh, come on. Drop the act, Joey. We know that's why you made up the story about the homeless guy in the alley. You talk to us now, we'll drop the obstruction charges. You lie to us again, we'll charge you at the full extent of the law, you understand? ♪ Pain is just weakness leaving the body, bruh. Yeah, but if you overexert yourself, who knows what kind of damage could happen. I mean, I sure don't. I don't know how bad your knee even is. In fact... I don't believe there's ever been anything wrong with your knee. You know what you do? You always walk away so you won't have to lie. I walk away when I'm tired of your crap. All these years, you've preached about determination and commitment, but you know what, man? You're just a quitter! I'm not a quitter! No, you're a liar! You lied to me! Because you wouldn't listen! We could've turned pro! We could've been world champions! And you're still not listening! There is no "we" in that equation! I bled with you, man, I've trained with you! I broke my back in this dump because of you! I never twisted your arm! Mark and Beth, uh... They were fighting all the time. She'd been funding the gym for a while now, with, um, profits from the bar. So she was tired of underwriting her husband's pipe-dream? Steals the medals, makes it look like a robbery. Most likely. She never confessed to you? She doesn't know that I suspect her. Then why protect her? Yeah. Why send us on a wild goose chase? [Sighs] I know that it was wrong. I, um... She's family. I'm sorry. That's all I... that's all I know. I have to... We, uh... We can't let you go anywhere. [Footsteps] What... what is... What is this? Joey Mason? This is a search warrant for your wheelchair. Watch your arm. What are you... are you kidding me? Are you kidding? Oh... You... why would I kill my brother? Athens. A... Athens, what? If you want to disable someone... That's one, maybe two shots. You destroyed your brother's knee. You really went to town on it. You want to tell us about that? I bled with you! I broke my back in this dump because of you! I never twisted your arm! I never asked you to stay! That's 'cause you never had to! I believed in you, man. I gave up my life... my dreams... For your lies. But you would've never had a life if it wasn't for me. You know, Beth was right. You've turned into a parasite. ♪ [Bone snapping] [Groaning] [Mark crying out] Ah! I can live without you. [Grunts and wheezes] ♪ We've got blood. Joey Mason, you are under arrest for the murder of Mark Mason. We've got a car around back. Let's take him that way. No! Wait! No, no, no, no! No, no. No, no. You're wrong! What? Joey, tell them that they're wrong. Joey! Tell them something. No, no, no, no. No. Hold on. Hold on. Joey, say something. Joey! Say something! ♪ Oh, my God. [Smack] After everything he did for you? [Beth hyperventilating] The undefeated Mark Mason. I beat him. Me. Congratulations.
