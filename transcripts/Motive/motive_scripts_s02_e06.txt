 Here you are. 
 Thank you. Keep the change. 
 Thank you! 
 Dude, she's into you. 
 Ha. She's a little out of my league, man. 
 Trey, you're the kind of man-candy that could make me switch teams. 
 I'm just not into the casual hook-up thing, man. 
 Yeah. Relationships are like motorcycles. 
 Eventually, they all crash. 
 What did Sheri do to you? 
 Speaking of crash... 
 Mr. Groper's back. 
 Trey : Yeah. 
 Woman : Get your hands off me! 
 I got it. 
 Thanks, buddy. 
 You know, you'd be a lot more attractive if you tied your hair up. 
 Woman : You'd be way more human if you stopped breathing through your mouth. 
 Remember Trent? 
 Yeah, the guy that interviewed you for the transmedia blog? 
 That's him. 
 So we're texting last night and I am my usual charming self, and his profile photo looks like Ryan Gosling, so we decide to meet for a coffee. 
 Fast-forward to the coffee shop. 
 I get there. No Trent. 
 I give him 15 minutes. 
 15 minutes later, nothing. 
 And tell me you're leaving? 
 Oh! But before I do, this comic book nerd walks over, calls me a "Lying bitch," and then marches out! 
 Comic book nerd is Trent. 
 Oh, but he is no Ryan Gosling. 
 So I chase him down. 
 Yeah, because when any creep lures you somewhere under false pretenses, you should totally confront him. 
 He hates my haircut. My new haircut. 
 Which looks great.

 Yeah, that's a lot of blood. 
 Yeah, at least two liters. 
 I mean, it's hard to survive that kind of loss. 
 If this it's one person's blood, yes.

 I think someone walked over here... 
 Vega : Mm-hmm. 
 Why? 
 And they picked up... Looks like a piece of jewelry? 
 Vega : Well, that could be a mugging. 
 Broken jewelry. An assault?

 No stab wounds admitted. No missing patients. 
 Hey! 
 You guys know there's no body in there, right? 
 Yeah, we just figured we need your expert opinion. 
 About what? How to remove stubborn blood stains? 
 No. Whether or not our victim could still be alive or dead. 
 Ah. Well, see... 
 Blood is like paint, and about a liter of paint can cover 200 square feet. 
 I see. Well, we had an estimate of about two liters. 
 Is that right? 
 I'd agree with that. 
 Which means our victim could still be alive? 
 Barely. 
 So how much time do we got? 
 Uh, if they lose another liter of blood without medical attention, they're done for.

 Thanks for making that call. 
 Medical alert wouldn't issue this information to me without a warrant. 
 Which, under normal circumstances, I would agree. 
 Yeah, but these aren't normal circumstances. 
 I think we should bury him. 
 That'll take even longer. 
 Well, then you think of something. 
 I've never done this before! 
 I've only ever seen it done on TV. 
 We could dismember it and dump it out to sea. 
 How are we gonna do that? 
 Where are we going to do that? 
 Are your parents still away? 
 Yes. No! No.

 Hey. What's going on? 
 Uh... 
 Remember that call last night? That was the alarm company. 
 The office alarm was activated. 
 Someone tried to break in? 
 Yeah. 
 I had to come down and deal with it, so as soon as I was done with the alarm company and the police, I-I decided to just crash on the couch.

 Bathroom's clear.

 You can come in now, sir. Thank you. 
 My wife and I appreciate your concern, Officers, but this isn't the first time Jake's lost his bracelet. 
 Well, according to our records, Jake is a bartender at a Caprice Nightclub. 
 Is that right, sir? 
 That's right. 
 How long has he worked there for? 
 Five years. 
 He took the job to help pay for his school and then he quit school. 
 Mm. Jake ever mention any trouble at work? 
 Trouble? 
 He's a bartender. 
 So what's going on? 
 Well, we're just concerned for his safety. 
 Does, uh, does he have a girlfriend? 
 Not that I know of. 
 But we don't talk much about that anymore. 
 What about his last relationship? 
 That would be Sheri. Sheri Anderson. 
 It didn't end well? 
 She left him at the altar. 
 Okay. But no one since then? 
 No one serious. 
 You're not telling me something.

 We found Jake's medical bracelet and we're concerned for his safety. 
 We'll find your son, sir. Don't worry.

Jake called him to confront him. Yeah, Gordon lied to his wife, Kim, after he got the call from Jake. Told her his office had been broken into, and he drives a car consistent with the tire tracks found at the scene. He also stood his wife up at a doctor's appointment.

Do you know him? Jake's dating Heather, Gordon's partner. His business partner. Do, uh, Jake and Gordon get along? Gordon tends to hate Heather's boyfriends. Oh? And why is that? Oh. Because they're not Gordon. Gordon's always denied it, but... I can tell. We're working it out. Okay, what did you and Gordon do last night? We hung out at home.

I've run Gordon White's financials, and he just bought 20 sheets of plastic, five rolls of duct tape, protective gear, and a hacksaw from a hardware store.

♪ Dr. Rogers : 10 stab wounds in total. Defensive wounds on the forearms and hands. Five of the stab wounds were postmortem. Overkill. I prefer the term "Passionate." It's less depressing.

Mm-hmm. 3:00 AM and 5:00 AM. 3:00 AM? And 5:00 AM. But the science of time-of-death is not exact. No... It's not. Bets puts the time of death between 3:00 AM and 5:00 AM. That means that Jake could've been dead before 4:00 AM, and that would discount Gordon as a suspect. Well, it also means that Jake could've been alive at 4:00 AM, and Gordon is the killer. Yes. [Takes a big breath] Does he look like a killer to you? Yeah! That's exactly what he looks like. We found him in his parents' garage with a corpse, Angie. Yes, I know, it sounds crazy, but Gordon's been in Heather's friend-zone for years. Why would he snap now? Why Jake? You know, up until a few hours ago, Gordon White was your prime suspect. No! No. - Yeah. - I said he was a priority. [Vega chuckles dryly] It's... Just hear me out. The smashed window, the multiple stab wounds, and the postmortem injuries, that all feels very... chaotic and passionate to me. Okay. Well... Gordon's disposal site is organized, it's clinical. Maybe Gordon's got a split personality. Or maybe he's helping someone who is passionate. Someone who knows Gordon. Someone who knows they can trust him. Someone who used Jake's cell phone to call him. Heather Williamson. Maybe she was mad at him. Okay, if she was, what would make her so passionate? Photos of her boyfriend with another woman. [Taps board] Oh, God... This was, like... Almost a year ago. So it's not a recent photo? Recent? I couldn't get Jake to talk to me, let alone take a photo together. What happened between you two? I panicked, and did something stupid, and Jake wouldn't forgive me. When's the last time you did talk with Jake? I haven't. When Jake closes a door, it stays closed. Oh. Well, we found, uh, some photos of a more intimate nature. We're wondering if you made those for him. Oh, my God! [Photos rustle] No. Uh... I took these photos last week. These are from my phone. I've been hacked. Okay, so Heather finds the profile page... Which we know is fake. Full of stolen photos from the ex-fiancee's phone. Right. And she freaks out. Well, it wasn't hard to find, was it? No. It wasn't. [Keys clacking] This profile page is only a week old. Vega : Sheri took those photos a week ago. It was meant to be found. Hi. Thanks for coming in again on such short notice. Your message said it was urgent. Well, it is. Our investigation has hit a wall, and we need your help. Of course. Anything I can do. How's Gordon? I'm surprised you'd ask after everything he's done to you. Well, he's still my best friend. I can't just turn that off. Yeah. I can't imagine how hard this must be for you. You knew how enamored Gordon was with you, didn't you? I knew he had a bit of a crush, Flynn: Hmm. - but I never thought that he was so obsessed. Yeah. He's obsessed. Obsessed is definitely the word. Flynn : Mm-hmm. So, how can I help? The night Jake was murdered, you talked to him at 3:17, and he told you about the damage to his car. Yes. Did you, uh, do you think that he suspected anyone? No. So why was his next call to your business partner? I guess he blamed Gordon. Actually, we think he blamed you, Heather. Jake : Oh, really mature, Heather. You know how much it's gonna cost me to fix this windshield? Well, you should have thought about that before you lied to me. I didn't lie to you. I have no idea what you're talking about. You know, I thought that you were different, Jake, but you're just like all of the rest of them. Where are you? Why do you even care? Because, clearly, we need to talk. Flynn : You thought that Jake was cheating on you. But that's Jake's fiancee from a year ago. I'm guessing if you'd known that photo was a year old, Jake might still be alive. Jake : Heather! Will you just talk to me? Heather : There's nothing to talk about! I saw those photos of your skank. What photos? What... What are you talking about? The ones posted to your profile. [Heather sobbing] What? You just didn't think that I would see them? There aren't any photos. Ohh! God! Everyone saw them! [Sobbing] My friends saw them! My clients saw them! You made a joke out of me. Okay, know what? Forget this. I'm done. Psycho bitch. ♪ [Jake gasping] [Breath slowing] [Crying out] ♪ You dragged me down here to listen to this nonsense? [Scoffs] Gordon killed him, because he was jealous. No, you're right. Gordon was very jealous. We traced the computer that set up Jake's false profile. It was Gordon's computer. ♪ 
♪ Vega : No, he made you think that Jake was cheating on you so that you would dump him. Flynn : But he never imagined that you'd react like this. ♪ Vega : Which is why he helped you get rid of the body. He was guilty. He tricked you. No. Made a fool of you. No! Gordon could never make a fool out of me. Gordon couldn't exist without me. Everything that he has, everything he is, is because I made him. He would do anything for you? Yes. Clean up your mess? Yes! ♪ Heather Williamson, you're under arrest for the murder of Jake Daly. Stand up, please. ♪ [Exhaling deeply] Well, you guys closed this case in less than 36 hours. Now, if that doesn't deserve a little Irish, I don't know what does. Well, thank you, sir. Maybe next time? You got it. I'm buying. I'm game. Uh... I'm gonna take a rain-check. Thanks. ♪ Does make you wonder, doesn't it? Who would you call if you had a dead body on your hands? Oh, the police. ♪ So, me?
