 It doesn't look like she's been more than that... 
 All right. 
 We know where she went in the water? 
 The coast guard said that the tide started to changed from high to low at 12:05 AM, so she could've been pulled out to here from the inner harbor. 
 So she could've gone off one of the bridges? 
 I'll check with 911 to see if anyone reported a jumper. 
 Thank you, sir. 
 She's not bloated. 
 No. She wasn't in the water that long. 
 About eight hours, I'd say. 
 She drowned? 
 Not that simple. 
 Two blows. Blunt force. 
 Any chance she was hit in the head by a sailing boom and went in the water? 
 Not impossible, but these wounds are the result of two separate blows. 
 So not an accident? 
 Yeah. 
 Judging by the severity of her injuries, I'd say she was unconscious when she hit the water, but that's all I can say. 
 Well, based on her dress, I know she didn't have the kind of night she was planning on.

 Oscar, fill me in. 
 The victim went in the water overnight.

 Hey, you. 
 Hello, again. 
 About what happened last night... 
 No. Don't worry about it. 
 It's no big deal. 
 Well, it was a very big deal to me, so, at the very least, I just wanted to officially introduce myself. 
 Meredith Taylor. 
 Calvin Higgs. 
 Nice to officially meet you. 
 Um, I thought maybe you could just write your number here on the back, and maybe I could make it up to you. 
 You got a pen? 
 Yes. 
 Excuse me, Detective Lucas? 
 Yes, Officer... Sung? 
 Hey, yeah, you got it right! 
 Good. 
 What can I do for you? 
 I surveyed the perimeter, starting at the shoreline. 
 I enacted a 10-meter grid search, but then increased it to a 20-meter... 
 You can just tell me what you found. 
 The victim's purse. 
 Oh! 
 Oh, this is helpful. 
 And her driver's license was inside. 
 Alicia Barclay. 27. 
 This is great work. 
 Alright. I'll pass this on. 
 Thank you. 
 Officer Sung. 
 [Knocking on door] 
 Yeah, I guess Mr. Peter Barclay's not home. 
 Mm. It's a nice place. 
 Can I help you? 
 Flynn : How long have you been Alicia's personal assistant for? 
 Just over a year. 
 And how was she to work for? 
 It was 24/7. 
 Did you talk to her last night? 
 She was nervous about the party, so she sent me a photo to make sure she looked okay.

 Vega : We'll need a copy of that. 
 This party last night was on a boat? 
 What was it for? 
 High Rollers' third anniversary. 
 They just bought the Luckiest Lady to celebrate. 
 It's a "platinum marine," it's very high-end. 
 The, uh, "High Rollers," that's the online gambling guys? 
 Yeah. Oh, my God... 
 Pete. 
 Yeah, we've been trying to get a hold of him. 
 Do you have another number we can use? 
 [Sniffs] 
 I have one for his assistant. 
 Vega : So he didn't show up? Okay. 
 Thanks very much. 
 Okay, so Peter's assistant said that he was definitely at the party last night with Alicia, but he didn't show up for work this morning. 
 He answer his phone? 
 Nope. It went right to voice-mail. 
 Maybe Alicia isn't the only one that went overboard last night. 
 Well, we can put an APB on the car. 
 And you and I gotta check out that party boat. 
 "Party boat"? 
 Technically, a platinum marine is a 120-foot yacht with a cruising speed of 12 knots, worth about $15 million. 
 See, you act like a normal person, but you're not. 
 I want you to know that I'm on to you, okay? 
 Alicia : The DJ'll be downstairs, and the flower arrangements will be over there. 
 Classic. No carnations. 
 Which catering company? 
 The Lazy Gourmet. They're the best. 
 They're also twice our budget. 
 Kurt has excellent taste. 
 My husband can be a little too impulsive with his decisions. 
 Well, Kurt said to make the best choices, and he likes what I like. 
 Besides, we don't want people to think our husbands are cheap. 
 Well, cheap, no, but not excessive either. 
 Alicia : Meredith, it's Kurt and Peter's night to celebrate. 
 Our husbands deserve this.

 Hey, Alicia. It's Meredith again. 
 I was under the impression that you were in charge of party prep and clean-up?

 These cases of champagne that weren't opened need to stay on board. 
 Yes, sir. 
 I wonder if this still works.

 How'd you do that? 
 My father has a lifetime membership. 
 See? You're not a normal person.

 This your boat? 
 Yeah. Peter and I own it together. 
 You guys had a party here last night? 
 Peter and Alicia were here? 
 That's right. What's going on? 
 Well, Alicia Barclay was found dead this morning. 
 Alicia? 
 Vega : Yeah. 
 How? 
 We are treating her death as suspicious. 
 [Stammers] 
 I-I don't understand. What... what happened? 
 What time did the party end last night? 
 Uh... 
 2:00 AM, I think? 
 When's the last time you saw Alicia? 
 It was at the party. I-I... 
 I'm not sure exactly when. 
 I'm sorry. 
 A-are you saying she was murdered? 
 No, what we're saying is we need to find Peter Barclay, and we're wondering if you know where he is. 
 No, I don't, but I... 
 I can tell you that he didn't do this. 
 Forensics'll be here in five. 
 OK. Can we get a guest list from the party? 
 Yeah. 
 Vega : Thanks. 
 Meredith : Looks like they were having a good time. 
 Flynn : What about Alicia? Was she having a good time? 
 Meredith : Always the social butterfly. 
 Last night was no different. 
 I just hope Peter's okay. 
 Here's the final guest list. 
 Thank you. 
 Look, you're wasting your time. 
 None of our friends would hurt Alicia. 
 They're just asking questions, Kurt, calm down. 
 I'm not gonna calm down! Alicia's dead. 
 Do you guys need anything else? 
 Did you guys have an event photographer last night? 
 Yes. 
 We'll need copies of those photos. 
 Okay. 
 Thanks very much. 
 We'll be in touch. 
 Thank you. 
 Here. Give me your hand. There you go. 
 What do you got? 
 Luminol showed blood on the deck. 
 And they also found red fibers here on the railing. 
 Well, Alicia was wearing a red scarf last night to the party. 
 Yeah. We're gonna need statements from everyone at the party...

 I had my phone turned off because I didn't want to be disturbed. 
 But you were at the party? 
 Yeah. That's where I met Andy. 
 Did Alicia know about Andy? 
 She knew I was gay, if that's what you mean. 
 She's always known. 
 Okay. Why, uh, why be married, then? 
 We had an arrangement. 
 I'm, uh, I'm catholic. 
 My family's catholic and my mother is catholic. 
 And, uh, to be honest, the world is not as accepting a place as everyone thinks it is. 
 Hmm. 
 Alicia understood that? 
 We were friends. 
 When was the last time you saw her? 
 Last night. 
 Exactly when, I don't remember. 
 What time did you leave the party? 
 Maybe 1:30? 
 I just assumed Alicia went home. 
 Can you think of anyone who would want to hurt Alicia? 
 It's unbelievable. 
 When you're ready, we need you to identify the body. 
 [Peter starts sobbing] 
 Those were real tears. 
 I know, but that doesn't mean he didn't kill her. 
 Yeah, but it sounds like she was more valuable to him alive. 
 Yeah, but money can only buy you so much. 
 I mean what if she was gonna spill the beans on him? 
 Alright? He was at the party, he had opportunity. 
 So did everybody else on that boat.

 Yeah, everybody thought they were the perfect couple, except for this one woman. 
 She had a rock on her finger the size of my fist.

 Defensive wounds? 
 No. 
 All right, so poor girl never had a chance. 
 Yeah. Here. 
 The severe fractures were the result... 
 Come over here... Of two distinct blows. 
 Identical impact impressions. 
 Um, with both flat and round edges. 
 There's also a couple of punctures, and it was heavy, probably metal or stone. 
 It could even be a piece of sculpture.

 I saw her on the main deck and below deck. 
 What was she doing down there? 
 I saw her fool around with this guy. 
 I'd just looked at my watch, so I remember it was just after 10:30. 
 Can you describe him? 
 It was dark, so I couldn't see his face, but he was white, um, around six feet, and wearing a black suit. 
 So, 10:29 is the time of Alicia's last appearance. 
 That might narrow down the time of death. 
 Yeah. 
 I just spoke to a witness who claims that he saw Alicia Barclay fooling around with someone on the lower deck. 
 Flynn : Well, that's interesting. 
 Yeah, maybe the rumors of her getting a divorce lawyer are true. 
 Who wants a divorce? 
 Our victim. 
 Vega : Alicia Barclay may have had a lover. 
 All right. So we find this mystery man and bring him in. 
 Our witness couldn't identify him. 
 We know he wasn't Peter, so he might know who it is. 
 Hey, have you heard anything?

 Only what you told me.

 Boyfriend? 
 Mm-hmm. 
 No. 
 I don't, I'm sorry. 
 She kept that private. 
 Well, Alicia was thinking of hiring a divorce lawyer. 
 She keep that private as well? 
 There's no way that Alicia was considering divorce.

 It was in plain sight. We didn't want to risk Mr. Barclay tampering with the evidence. 
 If Alicia wanted to leave your relationship, then maybe she threatened to tell everyone your secret? 
 Alicia wouldn't do that.

 We had an agreement for five years of marriage, for which she was going to be very well compensated. 
 Why would she divorce me now and risk losing that money?

I could never hurt her. Why? Because you were in love with her? I've never met anybody like her. Is that why you gave her your watch? That's my watch, but... I didn't give it to Alicia. He's staying in custody. That video doesn't prove anything. Yeah, fine, but I want to show you something. Watch this. What are you showing me? Meredith? His second wife, April, died in a boating accident, right? Meredith would've known that, so she kills the girlfriend, frames the husband. Jealousy? Get out of a pre-nup? Two birds, one stone. Nice. Thank you. It's not what you think. I had suspected for a long time, but Kurt finally told me about him and Alicia. Oh, you confronted him? Yes, in the office, to avoid a scene. Um, he admitted it. We argued. He went back upstairs. I went to the bathroom to fix my face. When I came upstairs, he was giving that stupid speech. Did anyone see you? Yes. A waiter. Can you describe him? I can give you his name. Which one of these waiters is Calvin Higgs? He was the one who saw Alicia fooling around. [Taps note] Meredith just named him as her alibi. Did he mention Meredith in his statement? No. It was also his first time working with that catering company. Hey, Lucas, why don't you look into... Calvin Higgs's employment history? Sure, start there. Reporter : Police are questioning the local businessman and online gaming entrepreneur Kurt Taylor in connection with the murder of Alicia Barclay. Barclay's body was found in the water near kits beach in the early hours of September 14th. Alicia Barclay's husband, Peter Barclay, co-owns High Rollers online gaming with Kurt Taylor. Vega! Flynn? Look what Lucas dug up. Calvin Higgs? Yeah. Currently assigned to the army's Special Forces Unit, serving overseas. Okay, but that's not our waiter. No... He is. Vega : Damian Cutter? Flynn : Come on down. Damian Cutter... used another soldier's ID, to get himself hired by the catering company that was working the party that night. So what? The guy stole a wallet. Look, all of our evidence still points to Kurt Taylor. Mm. Cutter joined the military straight out of high school. He's Special Ops. Then, suddenly two years ago, something made him go AWOL. Caught, arrested, sent to prison. Just released 10 days ago. First thing he does is book a plane ticket, flies here. Meredith could've hired him for his skills. He makes the perfect hitman. Alicia was bludgeoned in the back of the head and then drowned. That says "Crime of passion," not, uh, not "Black-Ops hit." Why would Meredith need a hitman? To frame her cheating husband and get out of her marriage. All right. Bring Cutter in. Thanks for coming in again, Calvin. Is it "Cal"? Cal's fine. Well, Cal it will be. You know, we really appreciate you being here. So it was Meredith Taylor that told us about you. She did? Yeah. About the relationship. I don't understand. There's no relationship. Oh.

Vouch for her, cancel each other out? Mm-mm. He didn't vouch for her. So he made a mistake? Maybe. This his recent credit card history? Yeah. Not a lot happening in his first two weeks of freedom.

They already know about him and Alicia. I'm worried about you. I know... you know what happened in Saint Lucia. What are you talking about? Everyone knows that was an accident. Just tell the police. Cal, you're scaring me. Please. Look. It's for your own safety. ♪ Okay, the flowers. They were delivered to... Damian's mother, who lives in Ladysmith. [Sighs] So not Meredith Taylor? Well, it was worth a shot. Flynn : Yeah. Lucas : Hey, wait... The florist kept the message that went along with the flowers. Well, what did it say? "Dear Mom... "April will always be alive in our hearts forever. Love Damian." April? April as in Kurt Taylor's second wife, who died on vacation in Saint Lucia? April was Damian's sister. This really was about Kurt after all. ♪ Airport, please. Departures. [Sighs deeply] What's going on? ♪ Well, I'm glad we caught ya. I am sorry, Detectives, but I have a flight to catch. Yeah, well, you're gonna have to reschedule, Damian. Let's go. And there he goes. [Siren yelps] Flynn : Yeah, there he goes. Vega : You owe me 20. [Siren chirping] Officer : Hold it right there. On your knees! Hands behind your head! Vega : Somebody cuff him, please? Officer : Yes, sir. Thank you, officer. Thank you. Why don't you take a seat right here, sir? We know you were on active service stationed in Kabul when your sister met and married Kurt. Yeah. Otherwise, Kurt would've recognized you on the yacht. Three days after your sister's death, you went AWOL. Hit you pretty hard, huh? You don't know anything about it. Well, we know that the Saint Lucia police closed the case in 12 hours. Dismissed it as an accident. No, they said she was intoxicated, but she didn't drink more than one glass of wine her entire life. You think Kurt killed your sister? I know he did. She called me. [Sniffs] She told me that Kurt wasn't the guy that she thought he was, so I told her "leave him," but she wouldn't. She was too scared of him. I was too far away at the time to help her. Then she winds up dead. If you wanted revenge, why wouldn't you have killed Kurt? Because I wanted more. You wanted him to suffer. ♪ 
♪ Alicia said you're being rude to her again. What the hell's going on with you? Meredith : What the hell's going on with me? You two are flirting in front of everyone. It's humiliating. We're friends, Meredith. We're being friendly. Are you sleeping with her? It's much more than that. Are you in love with her? Don't do this. Are you in love with her? I'm not doing this now, Meredith. Loud : Are you in love with her? Loud : Yes! I'm in love with her! Yes! ♪ [Muffled sobbing] ♪ [Gasping sob] Here. [Sobbing] Why don't you go clean yourself up before going back to the party? Flynn : You wanted to frame Kurt, which would've been easier if you'd killed Meredith. Except Kurt didn't love Meredith. No. He loved Alicia. So you put Kurt's watch on her wrist and you expected us to connect the dots. Honestly, you know what I wanted? I wanted to kill Kurt, but that was too good for him. Kurt : Hey! Hey. I know I promised I wasn't gonna give a speech, but I couldn't help myself... Mrs. Barclay? We've got a problem with the champagne. Really? Are we out already? Kurt, continuing : Peter, man, you are the best partner, the best friend... [Thud] [Crack] ♪ [Kurt continuing indistinctly] I thank you for that from the bottom of my heart. We wouldn't be where we are today, I wouldn't be who I am today without the support of everyone here tonight. We can't ever forget... ...remembering the people who made you what you are. Cheers! [Crowd cheering] To my partner, guys... [Guests cheering] ♪ If you wanted justice, you should've gone to the police. I wanted real justice. For your sister? No. For my mother. Yeah, well... Alicia had a mother, too. ♪ That wasn't justice for April. No. No, it wasn't. ♪ [Elevator doors ding] Detective. I wanted to thank you. Oh? You did? Yeah, well, you found the truth. That means a lot to me. Okay. See you soon. Vega : Hey, let me, uh, let me tell you something else that I, uh, found out. What's that? Oh, the $50,000 that you paid the Saint Lucia authorities the day after April died. Excuse me? I guess murder's cheaper than divorce. ♪ See you soon. People are talking about us. Well, I can wait 10 seconds, follow you out. That'll really throw 'em off. This doesn't bother you? Why would it? Because it's a distraction and we need to find a way to get them to stop. I disagree. You would. Look, the details of our sordid affair give them some context for your animosity. My animosity? I would just prefer not to be the topic of conversation. Well, you should've thought of that 10 years ago. It's more than that, and you know it. No, I don't. Neither do you. ♪
