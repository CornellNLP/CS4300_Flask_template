 Previously, on "Casual"... 
 Hi, Laura. 
 Hi, Valerie. 
 Grandma, where's your boyfriend? 
 He's parking the car. [gasps] 
 Valerie. 
 That's no boyfriend. 
 That's your grandfather. 
 Thank you so much for having me. 
 Well, who have we here? 
 This is Alex's girlfriend. 
 You know, there's no joy that's greater in a man's life than when his family comes together in celebration. 
 What happened at school? 
 My mom got a little too involved in extracurricular activities. 
 What the heck does that mean? 
 She f*cked my photography teacher. 
 Why are you even here? 
 I've asked Charles to marry me. 
 And I've agreed.

 Okay.

 No, you and Emmy had breakfast, and then she left, and you felt guilty, so you made me a guilt waffle. 
 No, that was a real waffle.

 Hi. 
 Hey. 
 Hi, Valerie. 
 So good to see you. 
 Hey, Emmy. How's it going?

 I stopped at Bay Cities. Got some sandwiches. 
 Hope that's okay. 
 Yeah, of course. Yum. 
 I love Bay City.

 It's not fun, okay? 
 They're gonna break me down just like they did at Thanksgiving. 
 Val, that was an ambush. 
 A coordinated attack on the homeland, and now we have the upper hand.

 Oh, I owed it to you. 
 You don't owe me anything, but I do appreciate your presence. 
 Well, after Thanksgiving... 
 I hate to interrupt, but I'm about to start a card game. 
 I'm assuming that you're not interested. 
 No. No, I'm not. 
 You're not a gambler. 
 Listen, I respect that. 
 Some people might call you a coward, but there is a kind of honor in playing it safe. 
 The hiking trails are just miraculous. 
 We should all take an afternoon stroll to ground ourselves before the ceremony. 
 Okay, well, that sounds good... for you, not so much for me. 
 Alex and I actually... 
 Quick change of plans. 
 I'm gonna play a little card game. 
 Oh, how wonderful! 
 Valerie, now you can come on the hike. 
 I can't 'cause I don't have the right shoes. 
 Oh, it's an easy walk, dear.

 Alex, please, don't start. 
 She lived on our block. 
 Well, she did until he decided they should run away together, and he gave her... every dollar we had. 
 She did leave, but not with him.

 Look, I've been trying to come up with a way to ask you since Thanksgiving. 
 I just couldn't quite find the words, that's all. 
 I don't even know you. 
 What are you talking about? Of course you know me. 
 I mean, you never wanted any of this. 
 I don't know. 
 Maybe I'm getting a little bit soft in my old age, or some of the regrets haven't faded the way that I thought they would. 
 Regrets? Right. 
 You got everything you ever wanted. 
 [chuckles] Hardly. 
 Listen, I understand that growing up in our house was a little bit... different, and I've certainly made my fair share of mistakes.

 Well, Mom, I just want to support you the same way you've supported me all these years: By challenging every decision I've ever made. 
 Should we head back down? 
 Will you just admit that I'm right? 
 That marriage can work? 
 I never said marriage couldn't work. 
 Just that yours wouldn't. 
 When you got married, you were a wandering child, grasping for someone else to make you happy. 
 I was 23. 
 I bet Alex is looking for us. 
 Exactly. A child. 
 I'm a mature woman choosing to make a deep connection with someone I love. 
 You called marriage "choiceful imprisonment." 
 And now I'm wise enough to make that choice. 
 Oh, well, why change the thinking when you can just change the narrative, Mom? 
 Valerie, how do you expect to grow when you're carrying all this negative energy? 
 Grow? 
 You haven't grown. 
 You've gotten older, so now nobody else will f*ck you. 
 We're here to celebrate, you know?
