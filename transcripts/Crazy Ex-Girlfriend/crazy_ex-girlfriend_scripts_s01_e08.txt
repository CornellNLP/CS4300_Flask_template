 I hate being a grown-up during the holidays. Work has me on double shifts this week. I'm not even gonna get to go to the winter wonderland. Gonna miss the fake snow, the fake presents, the fake trees. 
 That's the real Christmas. 
 Dude, have a nog. 
 I feel you. The holidays can suck. 
 I have to spend the day shopping for gifts for my mother who walked out on me and my evil twin half-siblings. 
 Geez, why do they need more toys? 
 Nutmeg me.  
 I don't know. 
 Maybe 'cause they're greedy. 'Cause they're brats. 
 From Beverly Hills. 'Cause they're terrible human beings. 
 It's the one day of the year my mother trots out Greg. 
 "Everybody, come gather round. 
 "Greg works in a bar. 
 Tell us what it's like to be poor, Greg." 
 Man, the holidays blow when you're old. 
 (Scoffs) I'm not even allowed to sit on Santa's lap anymore. 
 Uh, that's just one of the coaches dressed up. 
 He'll probably let you.

 (Elevator bell dings) 
 Oh, by the way, happy holidays.  
 Oh. 
 Or should I say, "chag sameach"? 
 You a little phlegmy there? 
 No. That's "happy hanukkah" in Hebrew. 
 Oh. I'm very tight with my Krav Maga instructor, Gilad. 
 (Grunting) 
 He's killed people with his thighs. 
 Yes, the Sabras are a fierce people. 
 So, I heard back from the San Gabriel county commission, Mm-hmm. - And they said, since there are no indigenous wildlife in your proposed industrial park other than a pigeon... 
 But screw pigeons... You're free to build. 
 You are amazing. 
 I have attorneys in major cities all over this world... 
 Cincinnati, Shreveport, Tallahassee... 
 And you are numero Uno. 
 Grazie, signore. Mmm. 
 Oh. Paula. 
 Hey. Calvin. 
 Hey. 
 How's everything? 
 How's that new grief support group? 
 Well, uh, they serve a substandard cheddar and generic chocolate chip cookies, but the sharing and... 
 The grieving is great. 
 (Chuckles) Oh, okay. 
 I need a moment. Excuse me. 
 (Exhales) 
 I can't believe I almost slept with that guy. Yeah. 
 Hey, wait a second. You're wearing panty hose. Ew. 
 (Gasps) Is that because your mom is coming? 
 Well, I just don't want her to complain and kvetch about how I'm not wearing panty hose. 
 And I just... I just want to shut it down. - Okay. 
 Also, again, I'm not trying to please her. Or anyone. 
 Sure.  
 But when you meet her, don't mention that Josh Chan lives here. 
 Because if she hears that, she might get the wrong idea and think that I moved here for him. 
 Which you did.  
 Not. 
 Okay, well, I'll do my best, but I'm not gonna magically change to please your mother. 
 That's not what I'm trying to do.  
 It's not? 
 I'm not trying to please her. 
 I'm not even picking her up from the airport. 
 I offered, but she said I drive like the grandma she's starting to think she'll never be. 
 Come on. 
 I can see right through you. You are a mom pleaser. 
 A level five mom pleaser. 
 You will say anything to make that woman happy. 
 That's not true. That's not... 
 That's not true at all. 
 Young Rebecca : Morning, mom! 
 Poached eggs, slightly hard. Your favorite! 
 I'm three pounds over. We're not eating eggs. 
 What are you talking about? You don't look any pounds over. 
 You look great. 
 You know, I was talking to Principal Kessler, and he said he thought you were the prettiest and youngest mom in my whole grade. 
 Just your grade? 
 No, no, no. He said the whole school. 
 Why are you even telling me this? 
 Principal Kessler's married. 
 But I heard his wife is frigid. 
 Go on. 
 All right, I used to be a mom pleaser, but I'm not anymore. 
 I'm not gonna lie to feed into her dysfunction. 
 Who cares? Who cares what an old lady thinks about your life? 
 Not me! I'm a grown-up! 
 Yes. And nothing sells that better than yelling, "I'm a grown-up!"

 (Sighs) It's so hot in California right now. 
 I can tolerate the Christmas crap when there's snow on the ground, a nip in the air. (Chuckles) 
 You know, your frenemy, Audra Levine, she just bought a country house upstate. 
 It is so cozy. 
 Now, she knows how to do winter. 
 You know, mom, I know this place is different, but once you get to know it, I think you're really gonna like it. 
 For the life of me, honey, I don't understand why you moved here. 
 Do you have one good reason? 
 What is so good about California? 
 You know, mom, it's not very nice to, like, blow in here with a bunch of criticisms. 
 Okay, okay. I'm exhausted. 
 Yeah, why are you going to sleep right now? 
 It's still light out. In New York, it's way past my bedtime. I already took my sleeping pill. 
 For once, put yourself in my shoes. 
 (Sighs) 
 ("Jingle Bells" playing) 
 The mall's about to close. 
 I just need to grab something for two kids who are either six or, uh... maybe they're 15? 
 You are a terrible father. 
 Hey, I know you. 
 You're Rebecca's neighbor, right? 
 I met you at her party. 
 Oh. You got really drunk, and then you slow-danced with that giant fish. 
 (Giggles): Oh. 
 That didn't happen. 
 No, it did... I have pictures. 
 I saw you ask it to go home with you. 
 Does this present say, "our mom sucks, but I'm gonna try very hard not to hold it against you"? 
 No. It says you're old and still think kids play outside. 
 Right. 
 So, do you need a gift for your mom, too? 
 Uh, no. I'm gonna get her the same gift I get her every year: My presence at her overly lavish Christmas Eve Eve dinner. 
 Wait. Overly lavish? Big holiday dinner? 
 What's the meat sitch? Turkey, ham, roast beef, shrimp, salmon? 
 Oh, all of it. It's so over the top, it's embarrassing. 
 Can you bring someone? 
 Okay, just to be clear, I didn't invite you. But... 
 That's a great idea. 
 I'll finally have a witness to the insanity. 
 Right. So what's your name?

 Good news. I settled the big parking lot case. 
 All the plaintiffs are getting four dollars. 
 If they can find their parking receipts. 
 Good. Hey, it's good.

 Yeah. okay.

 I'm your secret Santa, Bunch. Two pairs of panty hose, so I don't have to look at those unshaven stems.

 It's a funny joke.

 Come meet my mother.  
 Hi. 
 Look, this is important. 
 No one is wearing a Christmas sweater. 
 Why isn't anyone wearing a Christmas sweater? 
 It is national Christmas sweater day! 
 Whatever. 
 Well? 
 You said not to criticize, so I'm not criticizing. 
 Well, that in itself is criticizing. 
 You know that. 
 All I know is that I gave up law school and sacrificed my dreams for you, and in New York, you worked in a skyscraper with Audra Levine, and now you are here. 
 But I support all your wacky decisions, like working here with these losers... (Sighs)

 Your friends are losers. 
 Your father is a loser. 
 You, my dear, are a loser. 
 (Echoing): loser... loser... loser... 
 Wait. You think this is where I actually work? 
 Oh, yes.  
 I... 
 I misspoke. I don't work here. 
 What? - No, no, I'm sorry. God, that was misleading. 
 I don't work here. I was bringing you by... 
 What?  
 (Whispers): I volunteer here part-time.

 I mentor underprivileged lawyers, and I was bringing my mother by so that they'd feel included. 
 Underprivileged lawyers?  
 Underpr... 
 It's-it's very complicated. It's... 
 Sounds like an oxymoron. 
 Hold on. Watch. Um, Whitefeather employees, attention, attention. 
 It's nice to see your smiling faces out there. 
 Thank you. I just want to say that I believe in you, you can do anything you set your mind to, and live your dreams. happy holidays. 
 Okay, let's go. 
 Let's leave. 
 That was good. 
 Get the door. Here you go. 
 I know I said I wouldn't make any comments, but, uh, I breathe a big sigh of relief that that wasn't your office. 
 Oh, my gosh, I can't... that is so funny that you thought that was my office. 
 Uh-huh.  
 No. My firm, I wish you could see it. 
 It's over on East Cameron, which is basically the Park Avenue of West Covina. 
 Yeah, and I would've taken you there, but... 
 They are closed for Hanukkah. 
 What?  
 I work at a very observant Jewish firm, and all of them are in Israel right now, and I was invited, too, but I wanted to be here for you. 
 Wow.  
 Yeah. 
 Oh, they're mensches. And they're in Mensa.

 Uh... 
 Well... The VIP we're having lunch with today. 
 Who's that?

 Okay, I need you to do me the biggest favor. 
 I need you to come to lunch with me and my mom and pretend to be someone different, someone, like, fancy. 
 What? 
 Thank you so much. Okay, mom likes kitten heels, so change into that, and she also likes Jews. 
 I guess there's not much you can do about that by lunchtime. 
 (Imitating siren): Whoo, whoo, whoo! 
 Level five mom-pleaser alert. Whoo, whoo... 
 Hey. You're right. You win. 
 I'm a total mom pleaser. Just make me seem awesome.

 He was a Saudi prince, but he wouldn't convert, and that's a deal breaker for me. 
 He was so upset when I told him. 
 You should have seen his face. 
 He couldn't drag-race his Porsche for weeks afterward. 
 Why was a prince in West Covina? 
 He wanted to buy it. 
 Lovely man. We still text sometimes.

 Well, how do you like it here in... 
 California?  
 Oh, California. 
 California. It's a cultural wasteland. 
 Yes.  
 And the way they do holidays here, I mean, it's completely arse about face.

 Lovely. 
 Waiter! Hello! Hello! 
 So, you're British.  
 Yeah. 
 And you hate California. 
 Hey. You said to be impressive. 
 And I took a corporate improv class, and they told us to make bold choices. 
 So don't you criticize. 
 I am doing you a huge favor, 'cause you know I don't approve of this whole codependent...

 Oh, bollocks! It's so difficult to stop once you get started. (Normal voice): Cookie, you don't get it. There is no lie that you can tell this woman that will get her approval. 
 And it should not matter anyway, because you are not 15. 
 I know I'm not 15, okay? 
 Just stop badgering me and pestering me. 
 God, just give me some space.

 Greg, I think you should tell us what you meant by that. 
 Oh, no, don't get him started. 
 He's just never gotten over you leaving him. 
 Anyways, I know it's early, but can I make a to-go plate? 
 Um, what kind of material is this? 
 Oh, it's just a coat. 
 Harris tweed? Uh, some kind of wool. 
 It's really nice. 
 Hey, mom. How about I get you another drink? 
 Huh? How about some, uh, some water? On the rocks? 
 I'm not drunk, dear. 
 I'm just having this... This wonderful time. 
 I know. 
 But, you know, I'm finished working with Calvin, and I just... I hope we're not holding him up. 
 (Phone ringing) 
 Oh. Excuse me. 
 I need to take this, ladies. 
 Uh, hello. 
 Yeah. 
 Mmm... 
 I think it's time to go. 
 Agreed.  
 Not us. You. 
 Honey... 
 You have no idea what it is like for a single woman of my age in Westchester. 
 Everyone is so boring or married or cancer... 
 That sounds hard. 
 And he's practically throwing himself at me, don't you think? 
 He's absolutely coming on to you. 
 Okay. 
 Then go to Calvin and say I'm good to go. 
 Are... are you serious? 
 Becca... I thought you and I were getting along so well. 
 Having fun. 
 You don't want me to have fun while I'm here? 
 Okay. 
 I did not leave you, Greg. 
 Really? Because I remember bags packed, carried down the stairs, and a car pulling away. 
 Are those staying activities? 
 I wanted you to live with me, but you insisted on staying in West Covina. 
 You just wanted me to leave dad? 
 After you did? 
 You're just like your father. 
 You want things black and white. 
 You're right. 
 I made a mistake. 
 But it wasn't leaving your father. 
 We were both unhappy. 
 My mistake was that I should have insisted on shared custody. 
 I didn't want to force it. 
 I didn't want you to hate me. 
 Obviously, that didn't work. 
 Greg, you are always welcome here. 
 We all love you. 
 This is your home, too. 
 You know, I usually don't say this to people, 'cause it's a bit too on the nose for me, but you need to get over yourself and grow up. 
 And now, 'cause I'm hungry. 
 Wait. 
 You're the only person here not involved in this situation, and you think I'm the one out of line? 
 Um, yeah. 
 Because she's cool and you're a dick. 
 Mason!  
 That was... warranted. 
 Good call, Mason. 
 I'm sorry. 
 I'm sorry, mom. 
 Thanks, Greg. 
 Mm-hmm. Okay. 
 Good-bye.  
 Hey, Cal. 
 So I'm gonna head home. 
 Have a wonderful holiday, and I need you to sleep with my mom. Bye. 
 Excuse me? 
 Okay, so... I need you to sleep with my mom, just a little bit. 
 Doesn't have to be all the way. 
 It could be anything of your choosing. 
 Hand stuff, an erotic massage... 
 (Laughing) 
 Oh. 
 You're serious. 
 Come on. 
 Look, I bet she is a real spitfire in the sack, if she's anything like her daughter. 
 Right? You look confused. 
 Let me lay this out for you. 
 There is a ring, and it's been in my family for generations, and I am so close to getting that ring. 
 But if you turn down my mother tonight, that ring goes bye-bye. 
 (Sighs) 
 Please? 
 Please, please, please, please, please. 
 Okay. I-i get it. 
 I'm a mom pleaser myself. 
 Exactly. So you understand the burden. 
 So you'll do it. 
 No. 
 So, I spoke to him, and he really wants to take you up to his hotel room. 
 He does? 
 Yeah. 
 But I had to tell him no. 
 What? 
 It's too close to home. 
 He's my biggest client, and I couldn't risk it. 
 Are-are you kidding? 
 Why did you do that? 
 Where is he? 
 I sent him away. 
 There were tears. 
 Are you out of your mind? 
 Oh, God.

 Mom, what are you doing? Wait. 
 Your flight's not for another five hours. 
 Where did you get this crystal rectal thermometer from again? 
 Just give me the gift receipt, and I'll return it at home in New York. 
 I got it from a local boutique, and I don't think they take returns, just exchanges. 
 Let's just go to that stupid store on the way to the airport, okay? 
 Rise and shine! 
 Man (Over P.A.) : Attention, Christmas shoppers: Don't miss the sale... 
 Hey, guys! (Laughs)  
 Hi. 
 Just wanted to say, best of luck out there. 
 I thought you had work. 
 Ah, gave myself a Christmas gift. 
 Just had my mom call, say I had the flu. 
 (Laughter)  
 Uh, I hope you guys know that these are the good old days. 
 Like, the best of times. 
 So, enjoy them. 
 Thanks, man. 
 Ow! 
 What's wrong? 
 Oh. Oh, it's-it's my ankle! 
 Oh, it-it's bad. 
 Wait. Are-are you sure?  
 Yeah. 
 I don't think I can go on. 
 What are we gonna do? Who knows the choreography? 
 Uh, uh, well, Miguel has done a pretty good job. 
 Uh, change the formation? 
 Mr. Chan, you know the answer. 
 It's not Miguel? 
 It's never too late, bro. 
 It's never too late. 
 The only decent thing was a floor lamp, so now I'm gonna have to check a bag. 
 I'm very sorry, mom. 
 Okay, I'll pay the baggage fee. How about that? 
 You baffle me, you know that? 
 Your whole life, you have. 
 (Sighs heavily) 
 My dramatic little girl who never thought through the consequences of her decisions. 
 I've been here for two days. 
 I still don't know why you live in this dump of a town. 
 I told you, I got an offer that I... 
 I know you don't believe me, Rebecca, but I want to understand you. 
 I always have. 
 Fine. I will tell you why I moved here. God. 
 I'll put it out there. 
 I moved here because...

 You were always so impulsive. 
 Of course you would do something like give up your wonderful life in New York to be near that... that loser! 
 I did not do that, okay? 
 And he is not a loser. 
 You know what? I'm tired of this. I'm sorry. 
 I am tired of trying to bend over backwards to please someone who can never be pleased. 
 You got a lot of nerve, you know that? 
 After all I've done for you. 
 I came here to make peace with you. 
 I was gonna give you the Garfinkel ring. 
 You know what? Keep the Garfinkel ring. 
 Keep it! I'm a grown woman. 
 I don't care about the stupid Garfinkel ring anymore.

 I'm not a kid. 
 I'm Mr. Chan. 
 And... 
 You know what? 
 I'm realizing, it might be time for me to grow up. 
 And while we're airing things out, let me tell you a couple other things, okay? 
 My friend Paula... she's not British or Jewish. 
 I do work at that loser firm, and I never wear panty hose, because they cause yeast infections. 
 And because of you, I feel one coming on right now. 
 That's disgusting. 
 You know what? 
 I know you're disappointed in me. 
 I know I'm not the married work monster that you want me to be. 
 But you know what? 
 Neither are you. 
 You are a horny, unemployed divorcee who married an Irish catholic! 
 I am half him, and that is why you hate me! 
 I am half of what you hate! 
 "Hate you"? 
 I don't hate you. 
 What? 
 Is that what you think, Rebecca, that I hate you? 
 I love you. 
 I've always loved you. 
 I love you too much. 
 I wake up every morning sick with worry, wondering where you are, how you are. 
 I am consumed by my love for you. 
 And when you have a child, you will understand this. 
 If I ever have a kid, I will only care if they're happy. 
 "Happy"? What's "happy"? 
 That's a term for stupid people. 
 I want you to survive. 
 Our people are not about happy. 
 We're about survival. 
 And that is why I'm glad that you stood up to me. 
 Because that means, when the Cossacks come, you can fight back. 
 You can survive. 
 I love you. 
 Of course I love you. 
 I am your mother.

 Get over here, you get over here. 
 It's okay, Becca.

 Your Uber's here. You should go. 
 You should go.  
 Okay, okay, okay! 
 I'll go, I'll go. 
 But you're coming home for passover, right? 
 Becca? 
 You know what? 
 No, I'm not coming home for pa... 
 Okay, I'll come home for Passover. 
 Good girl. 
 Oh, boy, oh, boy. 
 You got it. 
 Bye. 
 Bye. 
 So, I found a gift for my mom. 
 Is it that you finally went through puberty? 
 (Laughs) No. 
 I got her a candle. 
 It smells like, um, pine. 
 That's good. That's a good first step. 
 You know, your lack of social decorum saved the holiday. 
 It was a Christmas miracle. 
 I get that a lot. 
 I had the best time. 
 Really? 
 You kind of hated me. 
 Yeah, in a good way. 
 I thought it was cute. 
 In what way? 
 Cute like a hamster playing the piano or cute like a man who's handsome and not cute? 
 I don't know. We'll see. 
 Oh, bummer. 
 I have to go back to work now. 
 No, I want to keep hanging out. 
 All right, I'll quit. 
 What? 
 I quit! 
 Hey, can you give these to the toy kiosk?

 Thanks. 
 Awesome! 
 Dude, weak. 
 Hey, Becks! 
 Haven't seen you all week. 
 Hi.  
 How was your holiday? 
 (Laughs) It was interesting. 
 I finally now feel what it's like to be a grown-up at Christmas. 
 Dude... me, too!
