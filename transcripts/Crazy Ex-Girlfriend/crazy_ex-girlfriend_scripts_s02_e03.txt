 Previously on Crazy Ex-Girlfriend... 
 Rebecca : I was in New York. I ran into Josh. 
 He made me feel warm inside, like glitter was exploding inside me. 
 Then I moved here. Josh and Rebecca are having s*x and basically living together. 
 What?! 
 I am applying to law school! 
 (both scream) 
 Yes! Yes, yes, yes, yes! 
 Paula : My dreams might actually come true. 
 I got a DUI, spent a night in jail, turns out I'm an alcoholic. 
 I've been going to meetings and I'm trying to stay sober. 
 That's it. Bingo, bango, done. Beers? 
 What's this? Okay, just a simple contract, laying out the terms of our friendship. 
 It stipulates that my services as a friend are limited to consultation and support and exclude shenanigans. 
 Rebecca, I'm very glad you're welcoming the opportunity to work on yourself. 
 The reason I got a DUI is because I was driving over the next morning to tell you that I loved you. 
 Oh, my God. 
 You and Josh... you're happy, right? 
 And he treats you well? 
 Um... yes. 
 I deserve to be with someone who treats me well. 
 Okay. 
 Is that Greg's sweatshirt? 
 (sighs) 
 Mmm, I'm so hungry. I can't wait for that pizza. 
 Yeah, me neither. I'm starving. 
 Mm. 
 (door opens) 
 Greg? 
 Greg, what are you doing? 
 Yeah, what are you doing, Greg? 
 Pizza in the bedroom, that's crazy! 
 I hope you brought napkins. 
 Oh. 
 Oh, come here, silly head. 
 (all laughing) 
 God, this is great. 
 I was so torn between you two. 
 I mean, Josh, I've loved you since I was 16 years old, and, Greg, I thought you were too damaged to love me, but now that you're in recovery, you seem like a really viable alternative. 
 It's so great now that I don't have to choose. 
 Isn't it awesome? 
 (laughs) 
 Hey, before we dive into the 'za, how about a three-way spoon sesh? 
 Greg and Josh : Great idea! 
 Yay! 
 Hey, who gets to have s*x with me tonight? 
 You guys want to arm-wrestle for it? 
 Sure! 
 Sure! 
 (laughing): Okay. Kiss time. 
 That's how it works when you have two significant others at the same time. 
 Right? 
 I was on BuzzFeed and I saw a listicle about polyamory, and it described it as the ethical and responsible practice and philosophy of loving multiple people. 
 And it hit me. 
 Josh, Greg and I could be a poly-amorous throuple, like you guys, since, you know, I can't choose between them. 
 Um... this sort of relationship isn't a default option for someone who can't choose. 
 And it's definitely not about arm-wrestling for s*x. 
 You know, I thought you were writing an article on us for Psychology Today. 
 That's what it said on the Craigslist ad. 
 Right, okay, so, don't be mad at me, but that was a straight-up lie. 
 But I still want to buy your TV stand. 
 Wait, w-w-wait, please, please, please, don't go, don't go. Listen... 
 I am legitimately torn. 
 What you're describing is a love triangle. 
 That's a completely different thing. 
 A love triangle. 
 I guess you're right. That is what I'm in. 
 (sputters) Oh, dear.

 (song ends) 
 (in baby voice): So, you see my predicament. 
 Cut the baby voice. 
 (in baby voice): Okay. 
 Rebecca, your approach to this situation is fallacious. 
 (high-pitched): What?! 
 Actually there are two fallacies: One, neither man is actually offering you a relationship. 
 Uh, mm, is it neither or kind of both? 
 And two, because of your mental health issues, you shouldn't be in a serious relationship at all. 
 But I'm in l... 
 You feel torn between two men, but it has nothing to do with those men. It has to do with your personal issues. 
 No. You are wrong. 
 I feel that it is my destiny to be with one of these two men. 
 You know what, if you're not gonna help me, I know someone who will. 
 Who? 
 Dr. Geller? 
 He's a hack. He got his degree in a hotel conference room in Turks and Caicos. 
 No, the universe, Dr. Akopian. 
 Look, the whole reason I'm in West Covina is because the universe sent me a sign, literally. 
 An arrow pointed straight down to Josh on the street in New York. 
 You're gonna say that's a coincidence? 
 Yes. 
 Ugh! I know you want me to be so logical, but that's how I've lived my whole life and I have been miserable. 
 So, you know what? 
 I'm gonna let destiny take the wheel, like Jesus supposedly does sometimes. 
 (sighs) 
 And I feel so much better. 
 Oh, my God, thank you. 
 Thank you, Dr. Akopian. 
 You know what? I'm calling it. 
 We're done. Take the rest of the day off. 
 Um, I have other patients. 
 You're good. 
 You're really good. 
 Is it even ethical to keep taking her money? 
 I do want that kayak. 
 Rebecca : Okay, universe, I'm ready. 
 Send me some signs. 
 A karate outfit. 
 Okay, that's a Josh sign. 
 (clank) 
 A whiskey bottle. 
 Hmm, could be Greg. 
 Signs, signs, signs. 
 Wait, there was a Signs 2 and 3? 
 How did I miss those signs? 
 Aah, this is so hard. 
 So many signs. 
 How am I supposed to make a decision? 
 You have made a great decision, Mr. Serrano. 
 Yeah. And with my client's cash, it'll be a seven-day close. 
 Hello. 
 Dad? 
 Yeah. Uh... who is that lady? 
 What is she closing? What's going on? 
 Greggy... 
 I got great news. 
 One of those house-flipping douches knocked on the door last week, offered me ten times what I paid for this piece of crap in '78. 
 (chuckles) 
 You sold the house? 
 Like, literally, just now, that was a transaction? 
 Yup! 
 You sold our house without telling me? 
 Yup. 
 You-you didn't own it, jackass. 
 I'm being very generous. 
 I'm giving you half the money... so you can go to school. 
 What? You did what? 
 Isn't that great? That is great, right? (chuckles) 
 I'm already in school. 
 Your-Your dream school. 
 Emory... in Atlanta. 
 You're always bragging about getting in, so-so go already. 
 Now-Now you can afford to. 
 Dad... 
 I'm trying to stay sober. 
 That's all that matters right now. 
 (laughing): Oh... 
 Son, no, no. Th-This was fate. 
 The guy knocking on the door, it was... it was like a sign. 
 Well, it wasn't like a sign, he had a sign. 
 It said, "I Pay Cash." (chuckles) 
 Listen, I-I wouldn't have sold the house before, because I was waiting for you to get your life together... 
 You were waiting for me to get my life together? 
 I think I was waiting for you to get your emphysema together. 
 You still have cigarettes here. 
 Oh, no. Don't pin this on me. 
 I'm fine. I got a great place, a retirement community... But not that retired. 
 It's called Barely Seniors. 
 Singles scene is insane. 
 So, while you're in Atlanta working on your MBA, I'm gonna be hitting on foxy widows at a swim-up bar. 
 S-Swim-up bar? What? 
 Dad, I can't just pick up and move across the country out of nowhere. I'm not crazy. 
 And I'm not supposed to make big changes this early in recovery. 
 I'm afraid to change my socks. 
 I've been 28 days in these puppies. 
 Well, it's your life. 
 And, you know, do what you want to do, but we don't live here anymore. 
 And the money is yours. 
 (groans) 
 Oh, I'm so confused. 
 I mean, I've barely been sleeping or eating, except for this sandwich... That was delicious. 
 I don't want to hurt anybody, but... 
 (sighing): I have to know, is destiny Team Josh or Team Greg? 
 'Cause I keep getting signs for both. 
 It's-it's exhausting. 
 Oh, I just wish someone would tell me what to do at this point. 
 You know? Not me. 
 Not anymore. 
 (phone chimes) 
 Oh, maybe this is something. 
 Oh, no, it's just period day. 
 Period day? 
 Yay! 
 Mm. 
 Ovunation is... the best. 
 Yeah, definitely worth the $1.99. 
 (chuckles) 
 Huh, it says we're supposed to get our periods today. 
 You got anything? 
 You got, uh, I don't know, puffy boobs, migraines, cramps? 
 An urge to dip chips in frosting? 
 Oh... Ooh... 
 Tonight. Um, I don't know. Yeah. 
 Let me see what I got here. 
 (shivers): Yes. Oh, God, those puppies are sore. 
 Our red friend must be on its way. 
 Oh, thank God. I'm so glad we cycle together. 
 Mmm... 
 It's like we're our own little blood coven. 
 (both cackling) 
 (in witch voice): Scatter, little boys! Scatter! 
 (cackling continues) 
 Oh, God. 
 Yeah, it is kind of weird that we're running a little late, though. 
 Usually it's like clockwork. 
 You know what? It's probably my fault. 
 I have been so stressed about applying to law school. 
 Oh... 
 I mean, I'm finally doing what I want to do, it just... 
 It feels great, but it's also, like, really scary. 
 Mm. 
 Oh, but you remember that scene in Working Girl where all the women walk to work in their sneakers... 
 Oh, yeah. 
 ... and then they change into, like, little kicky Nine West pumps? 
 Yeah. 
 Oh... 
 God, I always wanted to be that girl. 
 (sighs) And all my life, people have been telling me I couldn't. 
 You know? And I am so close. 
 (sighing): I don't know. 
 Having to wait six months to find out if I can have my dream is so hard when I've been waiting my entire life. 
 Wow. 
 How long have you been sitting on that speech? 
 24 years. 
 Mm. Paula, you can do it, okay? 
 There's really no need to stress. 
 It's all gonna happen. Thanks, baby. 
 Hello, ladies, I got the Ovunation push notification. 
 (chuckles) 
 So, I brought in your favorite chocolate. 
 Oh. God, I got to change my privacy settings. Darryl, what are you wearing? Why are you exposing your extremely white legs? 
 Oh, well, WiJo and I went hiking together. 
 We found this place in town called Heritage Bridge. 
 Have you ever been? It's so pretty, and I've lived here for 15 years, never even knew it was there. But that's the beauty of WiJo... 
 He helps me to see the beauty that's been under my nose from the very beginning. 
 (retching) 
 (laughs) I get it. I get it. 
 We're so sweet together that it's almost nauseating. 
 (laughing): That's kind of funny. 
 It's true but it's funny. 
 No, Darryl, I legit just barfed. 
 Oh, my God, I... got water mouth. 
 Honey, are you okay? 
 Paula... 
 I'm pregnant. 
 So, you think you're pregnant because you hurled once? 
 No, I'm pregnant because I ate that egg salad sandwich. 
 Yeah, honey, no one gets the egg salad from the vending machine. 
 It's all sweaty and gray. 
 I mean, you got to start looking at your food before you eat it. 
 No, okay, Paula, when my mother was pregnant, she could not eat egg salad. 
 I mean, just-just the thought of egg salad, and she would barf everywhere! 
 I-It's on the list of things I ruined for her, including her career and her v*g1n*. 
 Right, okay, and you don't think it's because they ship those sandwiches in hot trucks from Colorado? 
 No. No... 
 No. No, that's not it. 
 All right, look. 
 If you think you could be pregnant, then let's just... let's just go get a test and then you'll know. 
 I don't need a test. 
 I know what I feel. 
 Paula, don't you see? 
 Wait, (laughing): Paula! 
 Don't you see? Don't you see what's happening here? 
 (mouths) 
 This baby is a sign. 
 The universe got back to me. Thanks, universe! 
 Oh, my God, it's like everything was a test, and ding, ding, ding, the baby is the answer! A-plus! 
 Yeah, I-I-I'm just... I'm not following you, like, at all. 
 Okay, okay, okay. Paula, I put my intention out into the universe, and now the universe is telling me exactly what I should do. I mean, the baby can only be Josh's, ask Ovunation. 
 It's-it's his! And if I'm having Josh's baby, it means that Josh and I are meant to be together. 
 I mean, it would crazy to think that Greg and I were meant to raise Josh's baby, right? 
 (laughing): Oh, honey. 
 I am so worried about you. 
 Okay, so I am just gonna pop out and get you a test, mm-Kay? 
 And then we'll just... We'll go from there. 
 Having Josh's baby. 
 (exhales deeply) 
 Okay. I hear you. 
 I hear you, universe, loud and clear. 
 So what do I do, Guard? 
 Can I call you that? Instead of Guardrail? 
 It's just one extra syllable to make it right. 
 Make the effort. 
 I hear you. Guardy. 
 Hmm. 
 Guardrail. 
 Listen. My father has literally handed me my dreams on a silver platter... that's not quite as expensive... 
 Like a bronze platter. 
 He actually doesn't even own a platter. 
 He once served cheese and crackers to me on a Frisbee. 
 Point is, I can't do it. 
 Why? 
 'Cause it goes against the "big changes" rule. 
 In the book. In our book. In our book. 
 Those are guidelines. 
 There's only one hard and fast rule: don't drink. 
 Look, there's meetings in Atlanta. And for a sponsor, I can set you up with one of the best retired winos, my friend Barry. 
 He didn't get a cool biker name? 
 He's an actuary. 
 Be careful about stereotyping, okay? 
 Greg, I can't tell you what to do, but this sounds like an opportunity you've been waiting for. 
 Maybe that is more important. 
 Are you sure? 
 What should I do? 
 I can't tell you what to do. 
 But, seriously... tell me what to do. 
 Literally just told you I can't. 
 You could write it down. 
 Nope. 
 You could send me a text. 
 Stop it. 
 What if you told those people and they told me? 
 What? 
 (mouthing) 
 I'm gonna go. 
 Hi! 
 What's going on? 
 You sent me 17 texts to come over. 
 I am so happy to see you. 
 Mmm. (chuckles) (moans) 
 Also, it's not coming over, it's coming home, so... 
 (both chuckling) 
 Whoa, tiger. 
 I just feel so close to you right now. 
 Oh... 
 (chuckles) 
 Mmm. 
 (gasps, laughs) 
 Wow, I'm so glad I came over... 
 Uh, home. 
 Yeah, baby. 
 Mmm. 
 Oh. 
 Mmm. 
 (both moaning) 
 (chuckling) 
 Mmm. 
 Oh, wait. H-Hold on. 
 What? What? 
 What... w-what is that? 
 Oh, no, no, look at those later. 
 That's for later. 
 What? 
 Uh... 
 Oh... 
 Prenatal... vitamins? 
 I'm sorry. 
 I-I... I didn't want you to find out this way. 
 I was gonna to tell you after we made love. 
 What, wait? 
 Are you telling me that you're pregnant? 
 Okay... (laughs) 
 So, Josh, I know this is big, this is really big, but we've been so unsure about what's happening between us. 
 And now destiny has intervened right here. 
 I mean, think about it, I'm on birth control, you used a condom. 
 Like, this is basically a miracle. 
 This baby is a sign that we're meant to be a family. 
 You should sit down. 
 You should sit down. Sit down, sit down. This is big. 
 Do you need a glass of water? 
 Yeah, this is hard. Listen, I'm not saying this isn't hard. 
 This is gonna be the hardest thing we will ever have to do, but it's gonna be worth it. You know why? 
 Jeronica. 
 What do you think of that name, if it's a girl? 
 Jeronica. It's like the "J" names in your family. 
 I mean Josh Jr. If it's a boy, of course. 
 Or Jeremiah, I really like Jeremiah. 
 Hold on, I have to pee! 
 (Rebecca breathing rapidly) 
 (footfalls ascending stairs) 
 (door shuts) 
 (toilet flushes) 
 (door opens) 
 Rebecca : Okay! So, change of plans. 
 I just my period, so I am not pregnant! 
 Wow, this has been quite a day. Sorry to stress you out. 
 But, the good news is... now we can have some... period s*x. (snaps fingers)

 Josh : Stop it! 
 What just happened? 
 I walked in the door, everything was fine, but then you were pregnant, and then my life started flashing before my eyes, then you weren't... I-I... 
 Okay, I need some air, some... air. 
 Hey, hey, Josh, wait. 
 No, no. Rebecca, I need more than air. 
 I can't do this. 
 Do you mean the period s*x? It's not gross, I'll just get a dark towel. 
 It's not the period s*x! 
 Rebecca, the last three minutes have been the most upsetting of my life! 
 But I thought that you would be happy a-about... 
 It's-it's not... It's not just that. 
 This confirms what I've been feeling. 
 I've been so unsure about us. 
 What just happened... that's a sign. 
 What? A sign of what? 
 That we need to stop doing this. 
 This is all wrong. 
 Wrong? It's not... It was just a cas... okay, it was just a casual thing. But then I started leaving my stuff here and... it's just too much, Rebecca. I got to go. 
 Wait... what are you doing? Wait, wait, wait. 
 You're coming back, right? This is just a fight. 
 This is a fight. All couples fight. 
 No, it's not. 
 And we're not a couple, Rebecca. 
 What? 
 I'm sorry. 
 Sorry for what? Sorry for what? 
 (sighs) 
 I don't want to see you anymore. 
 Josh... 
 Hey, no, Josh! 
 (door closes) 
 (exhales) 
 Oh, hey, honey. 
 Listen, I got you a test. Um, I wanted to bring it by last night, but I was respecting our legally... binding friendship contract. 
 I'm not pregnant. 
 (crying): And Josh broke up with me. 
 Oh, no, honey, I'm so sorry. 
 So, my womb is empty, like my life. 
 Oh, no, okay. 
 Maybe this is for the best. 
 No, come on, this love triangle thing, the bouncing back and forth. 
 I mean... it's exhaust... 
 You are exhausted. 
 (groans) 
 Why don't you take a break, okay? 
 Spend a little time on yourself. 
 I mean, I think that would be healthy. 
 Yeah, you know what? 
 You're right. 
 Oh, that whole sign thing, that was so stupid. 
 I don't know why I even came to work. 
 I got to get out of here. I'm gonna go on a walk. 
 Well, y-you want some company? 
 No. 
 No, no, I have to be alone. 
 And plus our mutual periods might attract vultures. 
 She got her period. 
 (exhales shakily) 
 Scott, meet me at home. 
 You're, uh, both leaving? 
 You know, you guys can't just leave all the time. 
 Can I come? 
 Next time. 
 Yeah. 
 You've been looking at this thing for 15 minutes. 
 It's not gonna pee on itself. 
 I don't want to know. 
 The longer I wait, the longer I can pretend this isn't happening. 
 And the more wine I can drink. 
 Paula, you're probably not pregnant. 
 You're only a couple days late and we use protection. 
 Oh, God, this makes so much sense. 
 (laughing): I mean, this is what happens to me, right? 
 I mean, I finally decide to apply to law school and that bitch Fate just... gets me knocked up. 
 God, why did we decide to have s*x again? 
 It was such a mistake. 
 If you're pregnant, we'll figure out how to deal with it. 
 Everything will be fine. 
 (chuckles) 
 We don't have the money for another kid and... law school and food and Brendan's parole officer payola. 
 (chuckles nervously) 
 Oh, I was gonna spread my wings. 
 Yup, I was gonna spread my wings and fly. 
 I'm so stupid. 
 No, no. no. No, no. 
 My dad was right. 
 I'm a breeder, not a leader. 
 That's a weird saying. 
 I know. 
 Paula, just take the test and we'll go from there. 
 I can't. 
 I can't take the test right now, okay? 
 I'm gonna go back to work, and I will think about this... later. 
 (sighs) 
 ♪ ♪ 
 Greg? 
 Hey, what are you doing here? 
 Hey, Rebecca, this is weird. 
 Yeah. 
 I just needed a walk. 
 Lot of hours to fill when you're not drinking. 
 Also, I've saved so much money, I bought these shoes. 
 Oh! 
 How'd you end up here? 
 I, uh, also needed a walk. 
 And I found out about it from Darryl. 
 He and WiJo come here a lot. 
 God, they're a great couple. 
 Yeah, God, I ship them so hard. 
 Yeah, they're really cute. 
 Crazy that we both end up here at the exact same time. 
 What are the chances of that happening? 
 I don't know, I think it's just a coincidence. 
 I used to think that coincidences like this were, like, signs. 
 Like when you were a little girl? 
 No, like an hour ago. 
 Ah, how you've grown. 
 Yeah, I was so much shorter back then. 
 Is that even possible? 
 (mocking laughter) 
 This place is so beautiful. 
 We... we should've come here. 
 You know, a place like this when we were together. 
 Why didn't we do that? 
 'Cause we hated the outdoors? 
 And each other most of the time? 
 Right, right, right. 
 The two pillars of any great relationship. 
 Yeah, we were great. 
 (giggles) 
 All right, I should get back to work, I, um... 
 I'm literally never there. 
 It's a miracle I'm not fired. 
 It was nice to see you. 
 I've missed you. 
 Yeah, me, too. 
 This was a great, fate-less, coincidental meeting on a scenic bridge. 
 Okay. 
 I'm gonna... 
 (chuckling): Okay, good-bye. 
 Wait, Rebecca. 
 Yeah? 
 So, you were right. 
 You told me to stop looking for signs and I did just that. 
 I'm glad to hear that, Rebecca. 
 And it was when I stopped looking for signs that I got the biggest sign of all. 
 Oh, Lord. 
 Yeah, he kissed me. 
 And in that moment, I realized... it's him, Doctor, it's always been Greg. 
 Hmm. 
 Let me float an idea out there, and I know you have every reason to say no, but... can we try this again, please? 
 Rebecca... 
 I know there's a lot of water under the bridge. 
 And I'm not just talking about the water under this bridge. 
 There's a drought, why is there so much... water under this bridge? 
 Okay, if we try this again, if we take it slow, if we act like adults this time... 
 But what about... 
 Josh? 
 Josh is done. That was nothing. 
 It's-it's done, I swear. 
 Think about how this story has played out. 
 So I move to West Covina, in love with someone else, and he's the sarcastic, messed up bartender that calls me out on my stuff, and I ignore him, but we have undeniable chemistry. 
 And now Josh and I break up... and it's about me and Greg. 
 If you want to start over, I'll be here in this exact spot tomorrow night at sunset. 
 And if you're here, then we can walk over to that adorable mom-and-pop Italian place. 
 The Olive Garden? 
 The Olive Garden, yes. And... we'll just, I don't know, start over, pretend we never met. 
 And... forget all the bad stuff. 
 Okay? 
 Just... just think about it. 
 I mean, duh! It's the other guy! 
 It's the guy who was under my nose all along, that I under-appreciated. 
 I mean, him and me getting together... 
 It's the most obvious thing in the world. 
 Do you listen to anything I say? 
 Ever? 
 Yes, I'm so glad you agree with me. 
 Yup. 
 (relieved sigh) 
 I'm gonna go fall in love at the Olive Garden. 
 Mm. 
 (door opens and closes) 
 The kayak, Noelle. 
 Remember the kayak. (inhales deeply) 
 Marco : (grunts softly) So... 
 Beans said you could just keep all this stuff at his house? 
 Yeah, he's got a dog mausoleum with some extra space, so... 
 Until I find a permanent place to live. 
 Here, in-in West Covina? 
 Uh, not necessarily, maybe El Monte or Glendora. 
 Dad, I told you. 
 I can't leave because of my recovery. 
 Recovery. 
 Yeah. 
 Right. 
 This is why you're staying. 
 God, you're so dramatic. 
 What, are you gonna wave that around? "I've got exhibit 'A'?" 
 This is not why you're staying? 
 You're not staying for this girl? 
 You are. 
 And isn't that against the rules of your group, too? 
 New relationships? 
 They're guidelines, not rules. 
 And it's not a new relationship. 
 We're gonna take things slow, see how things go... 
 Maybe we should celebrate your staying in town by having a drink. 
 Dad, stop. 
 You get back with Rebecca, you might as well hit the bottle again. 
 Yeah, she jerks you around. 
 You fall for it every time. 
 She was figuring out her feelings. 
 Oh, God, would you listen to yourself? 
 You're poison for each other. 
 She's bad for you, and you're bad for her. 
 You have to know that. 
 Whole lot of parenting late in the game, Dad. 
 I got to keep packing.

 (sighs) 
 Congratulations! 
 What? What did you see? It could be negative. 
 What? 
 Oh, God. 
 Darryl, what do you want? 
 Oh, I have great news. 
 So, I overheard you saying the other day that you didn't want to wait around to hear from law school. 
 You wanted to start right away. 
 So I thought about it, and I realized that I knew someone from the school where you applied. 
 Don't make a big deal out of it, but I know... the dean... mm-hmm. 
 And we actually know each other. 
 We're not just, like, Linkedln friends. 
 Okay. 
 Yeah, well, anyway, so I called him and asked him about rolling admissions, and I... pulled a few strings, and... you start this semester. 
 This semester! 
 This semester! 
 (party horns blowing) 
 (laughing) 
 (party horns blaring) 
 Nothing can stop you, Paula. 
 Not anymore. 
 (sobbing) 
 Oh, my God, what have... What is that? 
 Are those... Those are tears of joy, right? 
 (sobbing) 
 (chuckles) 
 Maya, get the present. 
 Maya, get with the program, you millennial! 
 Sorry, I got distracted by the crying. 
 Maya, no one cares. 
 Get the box! 
 Nine West heels, just like Melanie Griffith. 
 (gasping, sobbing) 
 It's okay. It's okay. 
 I'm her best friend, I know exactly what to do. 
 Hey, what's the matter, sweetie, huh? 
 What can I do to make it better? 
 Do you want me to fire Maya? 
 Huh? 
 I don't really like her, anyway. 
 You know what? 
 What? 
 It's not that. (laughs) 
 I have something I have to do. 
 Um... but listen... thank you, everybody, for this party... and these shoes. 
 And thank you, Darryl. 
 You have been such a great friend. 
 Your best friend? 
 I mean, you made, you made my dreams come true, so... 
 Like a best friend. You can say it. 
 Just say it, please.

 (frustrated grunt)

 What?! 
 (sighs heavily) Well... this is fun. 
 It's hard, man. 
 You're moving... you just sprung this on us. 
 Yeah, this is huge. 
 This is so huge. 
 (car alarm chirps) 
 Guys, Atlanta's not that far, and I'll still be back for Christmas and stuff. 
 My dad's still here. 
 I can't believe this is really happening. 
 No one ever leaves this place. 
 I just don't understand why you have to go right now. 
 Like, right this second. 
 I'm starting a Tuesday, Thursday 6:00 a.m. boot camp in the park and I just... I really think you'd benefit from it. 
 Guys, it's time. 
 I need to get to Atlanta, get settled in, meet Barry, all before my classes start. 
 Barry sounds like a great guy. 
 Guardrail and I really think he'll be there for you. 
 Thanks, Chris. 
 Rebecca : Come on, come on! 
 Oh, my God. 
 Why don't people use... ? 
 Okay. 
 (grunts) 
 I gotta go, man. 
 My mom's waiting outside, and she's parked in the red zone. 
 Both : Caw! 
 Thanks for being my weirdly older friend. 
 No problem, man. Anytime. 
 Well, I should head to the gate. 
 I gotta go. 
 My mom's also in the red zone. 
 Yeah. 
 WiJo, I hope to be half the man you are someday. 
 (chuckles) You're gonna have to up your protein intake quite a bit, maybe start doing some squats, something like... 
 Oh, you meant that metaphorically. 
 Um, that's nice. Thanks, man. 
 No problem. 
 What are you do... ? Oh, come on. 
 Come on, just go, go! 
 Go, go, go. 
 You're the first friend I ever made in my whole life. 
 I feel like a part of me is leaving town, too. 
 If it gets too rough, you can come back, you know. 
 I-I did that. No one will judge you. 
 I did. I judged you. 
 (scoffs) 
 Kidding. 
 You're not coming back, are you? 
 I don't think so. 
 But thanks. 
 Thanks for being a good friend, Chan. 
 Are you crazy? (sniffles) 
 I haven't been a good friend to you in, like, months. 
 After all the Rebecca stuff, I can't even believe you still talk to me. 
 It's okay. 
 You sure? 
 Yeah. 
 All that's in the past now. 
 I'm coming, Greg. 
 Wait! Wait! Wait! Wait! 
 Sorry. 
 Wait! Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. 
 Greg, wait! Wait! Wait! 
 What happened? Where are you going?
