 There you are. 
 You're late. I have a school to run. 
 There are more important things. 
 It's always something with you, isn't it? 
 It's always an emergency. 
 It's happening. 
 They're not even at Brakebills yet. 
 I know. Get them there. 
 Pray that they get a little something under their belts before he finds a way to them. 
 Your ability to think that we have the slightest molecule of control over anything never ceases to amaze me. 
 It's not that. 
 I have to try. 
 We. 
 Look, this is your responsibility. 
 You have to get them ready. They're infants. 
 They know nothing, especially-- especially him. 
 I will do what I can, and you know this. 
 I do know. 
 Here... just in case. 
 You do still have an eye on our boy, don't you? 
 Yes. 
 Great. Great. 
 Not exactly. 
 Why not? 
 Where is he?

And that you were the most useless person who ever lived. And now... you feel better? It's the original version, the Danish version, that it's, like--it's dark. It's, like, 100 times better because the Danish people, they're--they're, uh... they have a dark soul. I mean, I get it. Get...? You're a kid, and your whole life's ahead of you, and you have these notions... about what life is... and... what it could be. But eventually you have to let all that go.

Not my type. Dude, she was wearing a unicorn T-shirt. She's clearly into fantasy. But how would you know? You're in here reading obscure fantasy, and she's out there.

I-I-I went into an elevator, and then I got out of the elevator. Thank God. Thank God. Thank God what? No, thank God that you're confused too. I just--I just started these new meds today, and I thought maybe... Stop talking, please. Stay focused. You've just been given an examination of your magical aptitude. "Magical"? We had reason to believe you possess certain... nascent abilities. Okay. I mean, I used to think that-- And perhaps you did at one time. Regrettably, you failed the written exam. I'm here to prepare you to go home. What? It's all right. We'll provide an alibi for your missing time. That test was crazy. Any sane person-- I mean, all the questions kept changing. Be that as it may-- No! Don't you want students who make actual inquiry instead of just accepting like sheep? I'm sorry. Um... Can I start over? Please? I can't just go to Yale if I know this place exists. Which is why I'm going to make sure that you don't remember a thing. [winces] This won't hurt a bit. Quentin... [clears throat] Let's see some magic. [clearing throat] [sniffs] No... magic, real magic. Please. Okay. [cards clatter] [clears throat] Quentin... do you like this place? You have a gut feeling that... it's something special? You want to go back to Columbia? That pointless, miasmic march to death you call life?

Three-year program, graduate-level studies, program begins immediately. How did you find me? Mm. Globes. Sense magic-- it's not always right, so we test it. How--how did my friend do--Julia? I'm afraid she didn't make the cut. And my apologies for the rocky road. We certainly didn't intend for Bob to die on you. The alumni guy? Mm-hmm. He works for you? Mm-hmm. Was he murdered? Snuck a box of Oreos. Magicians can't eat Oreos? Diabetics can't have Oreos. And the paramedic who... gave me "Fillory: Book Six"? Right. A scout--freelance, sort of. Any more questions? I've got another... 24 of you today. Um...okay... So "be a magician"? Is that illegal or...? Are you guys trying to take over the world or...? This school exists for a single and timeless purpose-- to reveal your innate abilities and hone them to the highest degree. Now, what you do with it after that is entirely up to you. If you want to take over the world, we don't teach that, but give it a go. Quentin, I need an answer. [scoffs] Friends and family will be given the exciting news of your early acceptance to a prestigious master's program, and with a little illusion work, all their questions will be answered. Good. Now, your meds. Quentin, you haven't been depressed. You've been alone. And you are not crazy. You're angry. And you are correct. Everyone-- everyone medicates... out there. Here, we hope you won't need to. [pills rattling] Um... are you my, uh... What up, roomie? Uh, hey, I had a-- Okay, um, I had a... notebook right here. "Fillory and Further: Book Six."

Physical kids, telekinesis, move sh1t, lift sh1t, most can fly. Also, magnificent partiers. Do not come by our house if you have anything important to do the next morning. Then there's illusions, healing... nature. Hmm? Knowledge. [giggles] Psychics-- you know what they are? [whispering] Losers. [both telepathically] Okay, we heard that. [both telepathically] Eat sh1t, Eliot. Like I said. What? Who are they? Don't. You'll scare the child. Maybe he should be scared. [sighs] You're so dramatic. [giggles] That is what's left of the third-year class. Were 20, now 4. No one knows why. They're just gone? Mm, rumor has it, killed. Or flunked or got bored or died 16 perfectly natural deaths. Whatever. We all signed this waiver. I hope you read yours. It says, "Spellwork is not unlikely to murder you, and, if so, oh, well." So stay on the garden path, kid. Yeah. [giggles] Wait, did you say "the garden path"? Yeah, enough maudlin blah. Let's go find something magic to smoke. Mm-hmm. At the exam, each of you did magic. What was inside you was coaxed.

Which means it needs to be stolen, right? Okay. Uh... Look, I-I really-- I don't want to get kicked out. And I really don't want to be the guy who dies in the first ten minutes of the movie because he's like, "You know what? Let's take out the Ouija board. What could possibly go wrong?"
