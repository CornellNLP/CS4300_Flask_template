 Previously on "The Magicians"... 
 It is the beast, isn't it? And he's from Fillory, which is real. You want to know what the beast wants? He wants control of Fillory and all the doors that lead there. I gave you a book about it. Stuff they're saying I did, I don't remember. Were you blacked out when we met? We need something or someone to lean on  that is bigger than ourselves. What was that? Did it work? It was more energy than I've ever felt. Still the same, determined, little Jane Chatwin. [stool clatters, blood splashes] [dramatic music] [grunts] Eliza is dead. She's the only one who could actually give me answers. There are no answers, because we have no idea what's going to happen next. Dear Q., I don't need to tell you how pissed at you I am. Probably got the message around the time I incepted the sh1t out of you. I don't understand why we fell apart after being friends forever. Anyway, I'm sorry for my part. I never meant to really hurt you. I put it down. I got help. I know you're not supposed to say the other person f*cked up too, but you f*cked up too, and it broke us, and I hate you for that, because I really miss us, Q. I'm working on forgiving you. Jules. J., got your letter. I guess we're both still mad. But I'm glad you're okay. I really am. Take care of yourself. [keyboard clicking] [solemn music] It's not black and white, Julia. It's all I thought about all day when I was in there, and it's all that I think about now that I'm out. Well, there's this sometimes very handy thing called penance. What, like 50 magic lashes? [chuckles] That spell you used to get inside your friend's mind, do you remember it? That's a perfect example of something that can be used to help instead of hurt. If you're not afraid to do the work-- I'm not. Okay. Q.? You can't sleep? I just, uh... Eliza gave me the answer, apparently, and I lost it. "Fillory and Further, Book Six." And it was important, and it just vanished. So did you look for it? Yeah, of course. Everywhere. I... [sighs] Fillory is always deciding when to let the Chatwins go and deciding when to kick them out, because Ember and Umber-- Right, the twin gods of Fillory. They get mean and take everything away, I know. Essentially, yeah. They have their reasons. But that's what happened to the manuscript. For some reason, I didn't deserve it. It's a manuscript, not a referendum on your character. No. I-- [sighs] In the books-- So you lost it. What do you do when you lose something? [eerie music] ♪ ♪ So you had it the whole time. I don't know what you're yapping about, as usual. "Book Six." The day we met, you said you had nothing to do with it. Like I said, it wasn't me. [scoffs] Want to get that thing out of my face? Ugh, fine. I took the stupid thing. I was bored. It was there. Now it's gone. Gone? What do you mean, it's gone? I mean I read it. I spilled my beer on it. I tossed it in the trash, and then I went and got another beer. Unbelievable. That's unbelievable. Wait. You said you read it. Do you--do you remember it? Ish. This is important. Okay, I need you-- I need to punch you in the throat if you tell me what I need to do. The Beast is trying to pick us both off. You've got the scars to prove it. I don't understand why we can't just be basic allies. [laughs] You can't possibly want to be a dick more than you want to live. I-- [sighs and inhales] What did Plover say in the book? Come on. First of all, what's-his-name didn't write it. Plover. Christopher Plover. The girl did. Jane Chatwin. Wrote "Book Six"? Holy sh1t. Yeah, she started off by saying that the other books are wrong and she wanted to go back and clarify some sh1t. Wrong in what way? Um, this--this was the summer that the mom died, and they were hanging out in Plover's mansion, eating crumpets. ♪ ♪ Right. Um... Jane and Martin opened a closet, and they went to Fillory. No. Martin didn't go. Fillory kept forgetting him. Forgetting him? Yeah. Martin was crying like a little bitch about Fillory not wanting him anymore, and Jane said hang tight and she'll find some way that Martin can go back to Fillory anytime he wanted. Yeah, and there were, like, creatures or something. Questing Creature-- if you catch one, There's seven of them. There's a dog, a rabbit-- Stop! I'm literally becoming less cool with every word you speak. So I assume she had her enchanted bow  so that she could actually get one. Uh... [chuckles] Yes, right. Yes. [chuckles] Stop, or I'll shoot. Hello, human child. It was a dog. I need a key to unlock the door to Fillory. I caught you, dog. No, wait. Not a dog. It was a pig. By decree of Ember and Umber, you must give me what I ask. Wrong. No. What was it? Back up. Ah, for f*ck sake. Hello, human child. I caught you. Give me what I ask. Did it work? As you wish, so shall it be. [light instrumental music] ♪ ♪ Wait. So the button is the key? Well, this all makes sense. It does? In the last book, Martin-- he's obsessed with finding the lost button. He's tearing Plover's house apart. The message boards are insane, um, with different theories, because the books--they just say that the button's magic. They don't--they don't-- nothing specific about it. Oh, this is huge. Why is this huge? Because it could still be there at Plover's house. Martin never found it. We could-- Whoa, you are talking about a direct ticket to The f*cking Beast. Better than him having one to us. Look, this is in a manuscript that you're probably the only person to have ever read. There's a chance the button's still there. [eerie music] I'm going, and like it or not, Penny, you should come. ♪ ♪ I'm coming too. Okay. So what's the quickest way to England? Ooh, Penny, do you-- Dick. Great. I'll--I'll pack. I'm sure we can find a direct flight. To where? Uh... Scurry along, Ronald. Raymond. Raymond. Have a great day. [relaxed music playing] ♪ ♪ Uh... So you seem good. Could use a top-up. [clears throat] So where are you flying off to, exactly? ♪ ♪ Uh, England. Oh, you don't need a plane. Margo and I made a door directly to our favorite pub. You can get to where you need to go from there. I'll show you if you take me. Margo's still in Ibiza. Ronald gives terrible head. It's not his fault. TMJ. ♪ ♪ I'm bored. You don't even know what-- I'll catch up. [man singing indistinctly] [swallows] How are you today, Keira? I brought a friend. I've been working on that thing we talked about. Julia's here to help. You want to lock the door? Yeah. Keira, I want you to think of somewhere that you love. We're going to create that place together in your mind. She can hear us, right? [eerie music] Julia's gonna meet you there. She's experienced in mental projection. I wouldn't call it a specialty. If anything goes pear-shaped, I'll pull you right back. ♪ ♪ [dramatic music] ♪ ♪ [speaking Greek] ♪ ♪ [both speaking Greek] ♪ ♪ [gasping] [panting] Richard? Keira? Hello? Richard, I'm stuck! Someone get me out of here! We screwed up. [gasping and panting] [eerie music] [gasping] Someone saw "Kill Bill." [exhales sharply] [banging] Keira, Keira, if you don't want me in here, then just let me go. ♪ ♪ I know sh1t Uma didn't know... ♪ ♪ Like how to become impervious to fire, so I will walk right out of here. ♪ ♪ [fire crackling] ♪ ♪ [whooshing] [panting] [birds chirping] Are you Richard's friend? What the hell was that? Needed to see if you were any good before I let you near me. What is it with Magicians and tests? Here. You need a pen. Did Richard tell you who I am? Just that you're extremely smart. [eerie music] I can barely comprehend this. Can you tell it doesn't work? There was an answer. I could feel it. I couldn't get there. Then my body turned on me. ♪ ♪ How long have you-- Year. But I still have this. So I sat and did the rest of it. You finished this in your mind? I talk. You write. And when you go back out, remember what you wrote. Yeah, yeah. Um... [clears throat] Fire at will. ♪ ♪ Okay. So we start pretty simply. The framework from Popper 45. Okay. This estate has been in the Plover family for five generations. Christopher Plover, already a prolific and respected author, was looking for inspiration for his new book when Jane Martin and Rupert Chatwin moved in next door. Not exactly. Excuse me? Question from the back. No, not a question, more of a correction. The kids got there first, Jane and Martin, and then Rupert got injured. Ah, we have ourselves an expert. [chuckles] Now-- And Plover's previous work, uh, he--well, he only got rejections for it. It just didn't really show the depth of the "Fillory and Further" series. Stay closer. I'm not sure I can do this tour without you. [light orchestral music] Now we have some pictures of the Plover family. ♪ ♪ Plover's sister Prudence cared for him until his untimely death in 1952. Stay with the group, please. Not all rooms are for public viewing. ♪ ♪ Prudence said Christopher so understood children because of his own tragic childhood. He aided many families in the area and paid for the education of his housekeeper's children, George and Beatrix. Not only did he write for the Chatwins, but he took them in briefly when their mother died. Legend has it Jane walked through a closet in this very house to get to Fillory. Follow me to the writing room. ♪ ♪ [camera shutter clicks] ♪ ♪ This is where Fillory was born, where Plover told tales to Jane and Martin. As Plover wrote, "There is no substitute for a childhood of adventure, warmth, and love." You will never be a man. All right, let's find this button and get out of here. [glass shattering] Shall we proceed, criminal element? [foreboding music] ♪ ♪ This is where he wrote it, right here. This desk saved my life. So I liked the books when I was a kid, and my friend Julia and I, we'd pretend to be Jane and Martin and... So I was 16 the first time I was hospitalized. I just--I couldn't get out of bed, like, at all. I didn't know that. My brain breaks sometimes. And my dad brought me the books, and I read them, and I felt enough like me to at least try to get back in the game, you know? Do you still feel like that? Broken brain? I feel like... I don't feel that it really fixes. It just works better now in its own screwed up way. Hey, would you break up with me if I told you that I've never been happier in my entire life? Guys, stop lovebirding and look. [eerie music] ♪ ♪ [door creaking] ♪ ♪ Boring, boring... Completely boring. Hey, this could be something. ♪ ♪ It's a letter from Prudence, his sister, to their lawyer. Plover died of a heart attack in 1952, but this is all about how he's missing, not dead. She wants a death certificate issued. Whoa. Holy sh1t. They lied. Why would she lie if the-- Rumors about Plover. He--there are these kids that were missing-- kids that knew Plover, and in his absence, people were talking, and the longer that they stayed vanished, the more people started connecting them in a bad way. No, I bet it's more complicated than that, right? Well, because--because Fillory is actually real. Exactly, and Plover was crushed that the Chatwins were missing, because he knew exactly where they went. I love a good cover-up. And the books were already getting famous, so maybe it was easier just to say he died, I guess. So what happened to him? I got a theory. McCabe, Livingston, Ali, Popper. Oh, my God. He was studying magic. Yeah. I guess that never made it to the message boards. But check this out. Kaminsky, Umar, Aurora. I've never even heard of those. Of course, you haven't. You're not a traveler. It's the entire 101. Plover was a traveler? Or he wanted to be. I mean, you go one inch wrong, you're torn to shreds. This is amazing. What if-- Try this. Plover's an idiot, like you, who wanted to go to Fillory, like you, so he tries a spell and gets blown up. Or it worked. Fantastic to idiots. You want some? It never empties. [clicking] [foreboding music] ♪ ♪ [clicking] ♪ ♪ [tapping and squeak] [echoing children's laughter] ♪ ♪ [echoing] Trapped here. Help us. [echoing] Trapped here. Help us. Alice-- Shh. Don't you hear that? [ominous musical flourish] What in God's name are you doing? You set off the alarms. You have to get out of here this instant. Okay. Look. Is this something that can be fixed with money? But you're not listening. Are you mad, or are you scared? You shouldn't be here at night, so please-- What really happened to Plover? I don't know what you're talking about. Yes, you do. Ugh, he's so panicked, I can't make sense of anything he's thinking. Okay. Enough of this. [gasps] I'm a super villain. Now talk. Okay. But then we need to go. Plover--what was the real deal? He was involved in some dark things. There's a book. It's hidden in the writing room. Yeah. I think we found it. Prudence--she didn't want anyone to know the unnatural things that her brother-- [electricity buzzing] Oh, no! Oh, my God. Where did they go? [rattling and banging] [ominous music] ♪ ♪ Whoa. ♪ ♪ Okay, then. Let's get the f*ck out of here. All in favor? ♪ ♪ sh1t, sh1t, sh1t, sh1t, sh1t. Penny. Alice and Eliot. f*ck me. So where did Richard find you? Brakebills? Rehab. Really? Yeah. I, uh...didn't go to school for this. You sound bitter. You caught that. [chuckles] You know, I didn't go to school either. [scoffs] Come on. Well, I went to MIT, but I didn't study a lick of magic in school. This is brilliant. Magic is science. Hard to crack on your own, but far from impossible, if you have the natural bent. Yeah. You know, sometimes, I wonder if I do... have it naturally. What if it's all just one big party trick that never adds up to anything? So? What if it doesn't? You know what I think about when I'm in here? This one day in this park with my girlfriend. We sat here in the rain doing this dumb little spell over and over, making a rainbow that lasted ten seconds. Sounds lovely. It was. Best day of my life. What's yours? Here. While you and Richard are juicing me up, show me. 
 
 [gentle music] ♪ ♪ [chuckles] I was ten with my friend Quentin. No one bothered us under here. It was like we were invisible. We'd read "Fillory" books for hours. I loved those. ♪ ♪ One day, we made this like we were gonna go visit. [chuckles] We were playing, but it felt real. ♪ ♪ See this. Chase this. ♪ ♪ It's the secret to how to be you. [chuckles] Okay. Back to the park. Let's finish this puppy. Alice? [panting] Eliot? Alice! Chill, man. They can handle themselves. [footsteps tapping] Shh, shh! What the hell was that? [echoing children's laughter] This house is haunted as balls, is what that is. [echoing] Come in here, please. Okay... [eerie music] Hello? Anyone or anything? ♪ ♪ [ball lightly thudding] ♪ ♪ [distorted ringing and whirring] [tinkling music] Okay, Jesus, we get it. There are ghosts in here. [electricity buzzes] I tag you. You're it.

What other option do we have? ♪ ♪ [groans] ♪ ♪ Okay, this is a little kinky, even for me. Would you care for refreshment? Oh, um, okay, sure. Sounds divine. Mmm. Okay. Thank you. We must get these things off our hands. Do you know Popper 29 yet? No magic in the house. Be good, or she'll take you to the quiet place. ♪ ♪ We'll be good. Right, Eliot? Mm, yeah, you're the boss, kid. [electricity buzzes] She's coming. [footsteps tapping, door creaking] [electricity buzzes] [dishes rattle] [foreboding music] ♪ ♪ Stop doing that. [rope creaks] ♪ ♪ My brother is too soft, caring for you when he needs peace to work. He has no idea how naughty you truly are. Now drink your tea. ♪ ♪ [clears throat] Drink it. ♪ ♪ [slurps] [eerie music] ♪ ♪ No. I'm over here. ♪ ♪ [giggles] ♪ ♪ Holy sh1t, that's Christopher Plover. ♪ ♪ Is it just me, or does it feel like we're being shown something, like how it was? Yeah, the time slip. You say that like, "Yeah, a sunrise." Sunderland talks about it all the time. She has a PhD in hauntings. Her favorite thing about a haunted house is, you get these ghost movies of the past running on a loop. You see sh1t like it was. I didn't know any of that. Of course not. You're an idiot. [footsteps tapping] Oh, my God, it's her. It's a tiny chick in a beret. Slow down, Jane. That's Jane and Martin from the books. Nerdgasm. This makes sense. Plover took them in, and they spent their days playing with the housekeeper's kids. Martin--he was, like, really sick that summer-- Martin, hurry! [light instrumental music] Janey, wait for me. Wait, no. I'm coming with you. ♪ ♪ Why won't you take me? Ember, Umber, why won't you let me in anymore? [sighs] [door rattles closed] I try to be good. Martin, are you all right? Where's Jane? Fillory. What's wrong with me? [sighs] Nothing. Some things just aren't fair. We can't make sense of them. Let's have tea, hmm? Come on. Us left-behinds ought to stick together. ♪ ♪ [electricity buzzing and cracking] She's coming. We need to hide. Quentin? [inhales and sighs] Okay, I'm getting the f*ck out of here.

Lady, I don't know who you think I am, but-- Insolent is what you are. I've told you I'll sew it shut. ♪ ♪ [whispers] Alice. [frantic string music] [speaking Arabic] [grunts] ♪ ♪ Hey, hey, we need to hustle. Mrs. Danvers could come back. Oh, my God. Do you know what this is? A vaguely whimsical horror show? She did this. She really did this to the children--Plover's sister. She tied them up and drugged them so that they wouldn't disturb his work. Okay, well, maybe ghost girl can tell us where the button is. Hey, Beatrix? [tapping] Beatrix, hey. [gasps] My tummy feels bad. [choking and gasping] Beatrix, it's okay. [coughing] How can we help her? I don't think we can. [choking] [liquid splattering] [panting and gasping] [gasps] Well, I guess we know how she died. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. It's okay. It's over. It's been over for a long time. No, no, no, no. Not for her. She just keeps reliving it over and over. We have to-- We have to go. We have to go. It's not the same. Yeah, I know. I'm sorry. Here, have another. Hmm. Let's spoil our dinner, hmm? Oh, shall we work a little? I think that might be nice. Do you think that might be nice? [light piano music] Martin, Mr. Plover, I'm back. I was in Fillory. Martin, I brought you what you asked for. You must have a look. We'll be right back, sir. She's dragging mud all over the floor. [eerie music] Stop that. You're pinching me. You've got it? Yes. Let's go show Mr. Plover. No, please.

[light instrumental music] ♪ ♪ All right. Well, I--I won't forget any of it, so... I know you won't. Can I give you a little advice in return? Yeah. Forget that school. The world never did help a smart girl. Why would it? We scare the sh1t out of the world. If the world goes after you, take it as a compliment. You know, I could come back. We could--we could do more. This was really the big one. No, I know. I just--I just--you know, I'm sure you have more things-- I do need one other thing. Yeah, sure. Anything. Kill me. That's--that's crazy. I'm allowed to be done. No. I can't. Well, I need you to. [gasps] You knew. You knew, and you did-- No, I did not sign up for this. Then what? Pleasantries? No, how about not killing anyone? What do you think redemption looks like, Julia? Being nice? Donating shoes to Africa? You think that really burns the tumors off your soul? What if she's wrong? You know, what if a Magician finds a cure tomorrow? What if there really is a hell and this takes me there? You're already in hell. So is she. What am I supposed to do? Whichever's hardest. [exhales] Oh, thank you. Drink up, Jane, and eat. You must be famished. [violin music] ♪ ♪ Jane, don't you want to join us? ♪ ♪ Oh, she's tired. That's all right. You go ahead, Martin, like last time. I don't know if I want to. Remember when I took you and your sister to town for cinema? Bought her that dress she wanted. Yes. We're grateful. When I was a boy, I didn't have anyone who thought about me. I saw it wouldn't happen to any child I cared about. I care about you, Martin. Come on, in front of the camera. Give me a smile. Mm. [camera shutter clicks] Oh, I have the best news. I am so close to figuring it all out. Wild magic, too strong to do with human hands. I'd have to grow another finger. [chuckles] Can you imagine? Of course, there's spellwork for that too, if I can master it. All right, you can go ahead and take that off now. [camera shutter clicks] Trousers too, darling. All of it. [camera shutter clicks] I think the solution to all our problems lies in Fillory. I need to go there with you. But-- I know. It's been for you kids. But I think we could find a way to go. [camera shutter clicks] We could be together. You're a lovely boy, Martin. Now turn around. They play like that all the time. A whole pile of naughty pictures hidden in the dictionary. [footsteps tapping] Oh, no. The mean lady. [gasping] Little spy! I didn't see anything! I swear. May God punish you. My brother is a good man. [grunts] No. You all hound him. It's your fault. Stop.

What...was he doing? ♪ ♪ [whispers] Oh, God.

Grow fingers? Like-- What if The Beast wasn't from Fillory? What if he went there because he had access via these kids who he liked to tell stories to when he wasn't drugging and raping them? Jesus. Well, I still have the capacity to be surprised. We thought you ditched us. What happened to you? Man, I traveled into a f*ck tree about a mile off, getting away from that crazy Prudence's dungeon. Not so precise with the travel, huh? Shut up. Wait, what do you mean, dungeon? I mean some dirt-floor basement bitch calls the quiet place, 'cause that's not f*ck psychotic. There's a storm cellar around the back. That's where she took the housekeeper's kid. He's got the button in his pocket. Let's go. Whoa. That's a great idea if you want Prudence to grab us immediately. Dislike. Okay. I know what to do about her. Give me a ten-minute head start, and then head to the cellar.
