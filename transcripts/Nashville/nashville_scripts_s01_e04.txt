 Previously on "Nashville"... 
 You're still digging out from the hit you took when Teddy's development went bust. 
 Bottom line, Joe. Stop spending money. 
 (Lamar) You think he's lying about something. 
 A mayor with secrets is easier to control. 
 What is his problem with my career? 
 He hates your career because of mom. 
 Mom had a singer/songwriter friend. You mean like an affair? 
 You've proven to have the same disregard for your marriage that she did for ours. 
 (Rayna) I'm trying to do the right thing, but none of it feels right to me. 
 I feel like I need to be letting you go. 
 So why don't you, Ray? 
 (Juliette) My mother is a drug addict. 
 I need you. There was a time when I needed you, too. 
 I'm your mama! 
 Your girlfriend's got it. 
 I think she feels like you might, you know, leave her. 
 What is going on with getting Deacon Claybourne on my tour? 
 I want him. 
 You deserve someone you can count on. 
 I'm not that guy. 
 Oh, look. 
 It's Juliette Barnes. 
 Do you know how much I have missed this? 
 A lot? 
 Yeah. 
 A lot. 
 (Teddy) Hey. 
 Hey. 
 Hey. 
 What? 
 Rayna. 
 Hey, sleepyhead. 
 You planning on getting up today? 
 Yeah. 
 I'll see you downstairs. (Mug clatters) 
 Take your time. Thanks, babe. 
 ♪ ♪ ♪ 
 (woman) ♪ Everybody knows what's going down ♪ 
 (man) Miss Barnes! 
 Miss Barnes! 
 Yes? 
 (sighs) Lord, what'd my mama do now? 
 Look, if you want her, just... You can take her. 
 She's all yours. 
 We actually came for you. 
 What the hell is this? 
 Shoplifting is a class "a" misdemeanor. 
 I'm sure by now you've seen the video. 
 About 4 million people have. 
 (laughs) 
 Seriously? 
 (laughs) Get a real job. 
 ♪ Oh, god, I've done it now ♪ 
 (Rayna) Will you tell me what's really happening with the polls with Teddy? 
 He's always so upbeat with me. 
 He's down 12 points. 
 No. Are you serious? 
 Rayna, he is practically on life support. 
 Hey, girls, ten minutes. 
 I don't think she can hear you. 
 No, she heard you. 
 It's called selective listening. 
 I was texting Virginia about my homework. 
 See, I told you she could hear me. 
 Aunt Tandy, daddy's gonna win, right? 
 Absolutely. 
 He has a fund-Raiser this weekend. 
 Really? I could sing. 
 You sing? Yes, I sing. 
 You should sing. I could sing. Would that help? 
 Well, Teddy wouldn't say so, But, yes, that would help. 
 Easy. Done. Just tell me where and when. 
 It's at the country club. 
 No. (Sighs) 
 (Maddie) Mom. 
 Mom, there's this video online. 
 You're not gonna believe it. 
 It's about Juliette Barnes. 
 4 million views. Not bad. 
 Yes, she's seen it, because everybody's seen it. 
 Baby, you got any more cereal? 
 All right, well, just come to the house when you land, okay? 
 At least something made without raisins. 
 You know I hate raisins. 
 All right, Makena's on her way to J.F.K. 
 Makena? Yeah. 
 Why? Doesn't she have Kristen Stewart to worry about? 
 When you're at the center of a publicity nightmare, you generally need your publicist. 
 You're kidding me, baby. You got no milk. (Scoffs) 
 (lowered voice) I cannot believe she has to stay here. (Sighs) 
 (scoffs) After everything that's transpired in the last 48 hours, that's what you can't believe? 
 You know what, Glenn? You need to relax. 
 As Makena would say, any publicity is good publicity. 
 (sighs) Yeah, well, I don't think she'd say that. 
 At least I look good. 
 (scoffs) 
 (door opens and closes) 
 Hey. 
 Hey. How was your day? 
 It was long. 
 They make you show up at 6:00. 
 Turns out there's some noise ordinance. 
 Couldn't even start TILL 8:00. 
 Oh. How about you? 
 Uneventful. Yeah? 
 Waiting on news that's never coming from a phone that's never ringing. 
 Well, look, just the fact that you got to record a demo with watty white... 
 I mean, people would kill for that opportunity. 
 I know. I know. 
 All you can control is what you put out there, not whether some publisher will be interested. 
 Yeah, well, I just wish They'd tell me no so I could put it out of my mind. 
 Well... if you really wanna put it out of your mind... 
 (knock on door) 
 (Gunnar) Anyone home? Gunnar. 
 (sighs) 
 Seriously? 
 Hey. 
 Hey. 
 Uh... sorry to just show up like this, but I thought you'd wanna know as soon as I'd heard. 
 What? 
 We got the deal. 
 Are you serious? No. 
 No? He's messing with you. 
 I'm messing with you. We got the deal! 
 (screams) don't you mess with me! 
 Oh, I'm so excited! We got a deal! 
 (Scarlett laughs) 
 Oh, my god. I can't believe it. 
 (laughs) 
 (man) ♪ Dreaming about me ♪ 
 Hey. 
 Hey. 
 So I heard a rumor today that you're gonna be doing a set for me at the country club. Well, I hope it's more than a rumor. 
 And I hope they're putting out a press release. 
 That's why I'm doing it. They did. 
 And thanks. 
 I really mean it. 
 Babe... You know you can tell me if things aren't going well. 
 Things are going fine. 
 (cufflinks clatter) 
 All right, well... 
 12 points down doesn't exactly sound fine. 
 Hon, who... Who told you that? 
 My sister. 
 Oh. The mouth of the south. 
 Right. She's also the one who told me about this fund-Raiser. 
 Okay. That's internal polling that she's talking about, and there is a huge margin of error. 
 All right, But if you're not telling me anything, then she's the only one I've got to listen to. 
 Coming home and telling you about everything that's going wrong, the... the... the country club, your dad being involved... 
 Honey, I'm just trying to spare you. 
 Well, I appreciate that. 
 And, you know, I was gonna talk to you about this whole country club venue. 
 Maybe we can think about changing it. 
 I mean, I can sing anywhere, hon. 
 I can sing at the airport... 
 (chuckles) Mars. 
 Hell. There you go. 
 Connecticut. 
 Yes, we know. Of course. A disturbing subject for a lot of parents... 
 We called Makena. No doubt you've all seen or heard about country star Juliette Barnes' shoplifting incident... tomorrow, I guess. (Jolene) Baby, lookit here. There's at least 20 different kinds of nail polish in here, all different colors. 
 Now why on earth do you go and steal 'em when you have all these here? 
 Why don't you just mind your own business? 
 (bags rustle) 
 Can't you do something with her, like send her back to Birmingham? 
 (bags thud) 
 That's for the judge to decide at her hearing. 
 I can't do anything. What, in seven weeks? 
 Can't you do something? Pull some strings? 
 Tell them who I am. 
 Doubt that'll do much Good right now. 
 (footsteps retreat) 
 I can't be around her for another second. 
 (man) There she is! I see her! The thief! 
 (man) You've been stealing! 
 (camera shutter clicks) 
 (paparazzi shouting indistinctly at once) 
 You've gotta be kidding me. 
 (Emily) Stay down. Just stay down. 
 I think we should turn around. 
 (indistinct shouting continues) 
 This is a nightmare. 
 (camera shutters continue clicking) 
 (sighs)

 (Emily) She's here! 
 Thank God. Makena. 
 How was your flight? 
 It was torture. No internet. 
 I landed to 75 e-mails. How's everyone here? 
 Oh, hi, to you, too. 
 So I drafted out a release on the plane. 
 We need to get the statement out immediately. 
 No. No release. 
 Can I have a moment, please? 
 I'm trying to get in touch with my center. 
 We need to issue a statement. 
 (sighs) Says who? 
 Says your fans who bought tickets to your concert. 
 They at least need some sort of explanation. 
 Now we need to get ahead of this thing, or else the fallout could be huge, so I have scheduled an interview with "G.M.A." 
 "Good morning America"? 
 Isn't there any other news? 
 Isn't there an election going on or something? 
 No, no. 
 I am not letting any negative energy in. 
 (inhales deeply) No interview, no statement. 
 I have a tour to prepare for, and that's exactly what I'm-a do. 
 Namaste. 
 Hey, Deacon. Bucky. 
 Hey, Bucky, what's up? 
 Uh, I wanna see if you're free Friday night. 
 Sure. For what? 
 Uh, Rayna's doing a gig. 
 What are we doing? What are we playing? 
 Country club. It's a fund-raiser for Teddy. 
 H-Have you talked to Rayna? 
 'cause I'm supporting Coleman. 
 Well, look, Deacon, I mean, you know, political affiliations aside, she needs a guitar player, So, um, I don't know. You good? 
 Yeah. All right. I'll be there. 
 (indistinct conversations) 
 (beeps) hard to say "No" to that family. 
 You finally did. 
 They made it easy for me. 
 You wanna talk about it? 
 You're not my therapist, Coleman. 
 You're my sponsor. 
 The same thing. 
 (sighs deeply) 
 And this is my office. 
 That is what we call the wall of fame... 
 People who started out with publishing deals, just like y'all, hoping for that famous singer to cut one of their songs. 
 Come on. Let's keep going. 
 Uh, down the hall we've got the writers' rooms. 
 We'll show you in a minute. 
 Out back there's a patio. Feel free to use it whenever you're just restin' and not workin', and in here is the kitchen that is available to you 24/7, and it is fully stocked. 
 You mind? No. Go ahead. 
 Come on. I'll show you the writers' rooms. 
 They're down this way. 
 That's mine. 
 Uh... sorry. Jeanne said I could. 
 Should've put my name on it. Hailey. 
 Gunnar. I'm new here. 
 I know. I'm Jeanne's assistant. 
 I-I heard your demo... "Fade Into You." (chuckles) literally, I-I cannot stop playing that in my car. 
 Hey, we lost you. (Giggles) 
 Sorry. I was just meeting Hailey. 
 Hailey, this is Scarlett, my partner. Hey. 
 My... My w-writing partner. 
 Nice to meet you. 
 Um, Jeanne wants to take us to dinner tonight. 
 We take all the new writers out to celebrate. 
 How many, um, should I make for the reservation? 
 You can invite whoever you want... your boyfriend, or your girlfriend or... Whatever floats your boat. 
 I should bring my boyfriend if that's all right. 
 Yeah. My boat's just me. 
 (laughs) at the moment. It's a... kayak. 
 (chuckles) 
 (laughs) We'll see you later tonight. Come on. 
 Have a good first day, and, uh, keep your mitts off my yogurt. 
 We're bringing in everything, so if it's up to you whether you use the full band or no. 
 Yeah. Yeah? 
 You know... if the guys are willing to do it, let's give these people a show. 
 Sure. 
 Oh, you know what? We'll probably have to get somebody else for lead guitar, though. 
 There's no way Deacon's gonna wanna do this thing. 
 Uh, well, I assumed we would be using Deacon. 
 (pot lid clatters) Unh-Unh. He hates all this kind of thing... 
 Country club, daddy's gonna be there. 
 No, no. I mean, shoot, I don't even wanna do this, so there's no way he's gonna wanna do it. 
 Well, I-I talked to him about it, and he didn't have a problem with it. You did? 
 Yeah. I mean, if you want me to call him back and tell him you changed your mind, I can... 
 No. No, no, no. He said that? 
 He said it wouldn't be an issue. 
 All right. 
 If he can deal with it, I can deal with it. 
 Katia was thinking this would be perfect for "Tumbleweed." 
 Really? Well, I look like a hillbilly. 
 Yeah. You kinda do. 
 According to the notes, it's straight off the runways in Paris. 
 Okay, well, here are my notes. This does not look sexy. 
 This looks poor. I kinda like it. 
 Well, you would. 
 Maybe next year. 
 Glenn? 
 (cell phone beeps) 
 You cannot be serious about this outfit. 
 What? 
 I just got off the phone with the executive producer of the C.M.A.s. 
 You're welcome to attend, but they're removing you from their list of presenters. 
 What? 
 You know, this isn't the first call I've gotten. 
 You're the butt of every joke on the late-Night circuit. 
 "S.N.L." Is doing an opening sketch, for crying out loud. 
 You know, I know you don't wanna hear this, but as quickly as you came up in this business, that's how fast you can disappear. 
 People like Martina Mcbride, Rayna James... 
 Their longevity wasn't a given. They had to earn it. 
 And as good as you are, you haven't earned it yet. 
 He's right. 
 This is a make-or-break moment. 
 You have got one shot to set the record straight, to be the person the world thinks you are. 
 (Glenn) You wanna keep living this life? 
 I suggest you take it. 
 Schedule the "G.M.A." interview. 
 I'll do it. 
 So I packed up my car in Austin, drove to Nashville, and started knocking on people's doors till somebody hired me. (Chuckles) 
 I was lucky enough to land at The Bluebird. 
 That was almost three years ago. 
 (Jeanne) And you? How about you? 
 How'd you get out here? How'd you start writing? 
 Oh, actually, I came out here 'cause when I first met Avery, it's where he wanted to be, always. 
 The writing thing was kind of an accident. 
 When I was little, my mama taught me that song lyrics were just poems put to music. 
 And she used to get the little cd jackets with the lyrics printed on the inside so I'd know what I was singing along to. 
 And soon as I could write, I started trying to write my own poems and stories. 
 (giggles) 
 And you love it? 
 Yeah, I... I do. 
 It's just always amazed me, when you're trying to create an image, the difference that a word makes. 
 A-and the more specific you get with that image, the more universal it becomes. 
 I... if you know what I mean. 
 I don't want to go on and on, though. 
 Um, obviously, I'm just starting out. 
 And you're better than a lot of people who have been out here doing it for a lot longer than you have. 
 Thank you. (Laughs) 
 Oh, and her uncle is Deacon Claybourne. 
 Oh, wow. 
 Well, that explains a lot. Quite a pedigree. 
 Actually, a lot of what I learned is from Avery. 
 He's an incredible songwriter. 
 Come on, Scarlett. It's true. You are. 
 Stop it. 
 No, they have a band. They play at the 5 Spot all the time. 
 And they're really amazing. 
 That's enough, really. 
 No, 5 Spot's great. Good for you. 
 Yeah, well, I love playing there... or anywhere, really. 
 So where are you from, Hailey? 
 Colorado, weirdly. 
 Why weirdly? 
 We're still missing a few host committee folks, but we'll go ahead and get started. 
 Rayna, we are just absolutely thrilled that you're doing this. 
 It's gonna be like old home week for you. 
 The tickets just flew out the door once everyone found out you'd be singing. 
 Well, I'm thrilled to be here, and, you know, it'll be so nice to see so many old familiar faces. 
 Oh, Peggy, there you are. 
 Hey! 
 Sorry. I got hung up at work. 
 I thought I'd missed the meeting. 
 Hi, Peggy. 
 Rayna. 
 How are you? It's been a long time. 
 I know. 
 I didn't see your name on the host committee. 
 I didn't know that you were doing this. 
 I go by Margaret. Kenter now. 
 I married Robert. 
 Oh, right. Robert. I saw that in the society pages. 
 Yeah. Hey there, Peggy. 
 Hey! 
 Thanks for doing this. Appreciate it. 
 Oh, happy to. 
 Always said you'd make a great politician. (Chuckles) 
 Ah, well, we'll see. 
 Mm. 
 Ah. 
 (Jeanne) You got it. 
 Thank you so much. Good night. 
 Bye. 
 
 
 
 Well, it's still early. (Laughs) 
 Y'all up for another round? 
 Yeah. (Gunnar) Sure. 
 I think we'll call it a night. 
 Yeah. I guess it's been kind of a long day. 
 Uh, we can go. 
 Uh, you sure? 
 Yep. I'll, uh, see you guys later. 
 See ya. (Hailey and Gunnar) All right. 
 (Scarlett and Gunnar) Bye. 
 Are you all right? 
 Yeah. Just wanna go home. 
 You're welcome to go out if you want to. 
 I-is this because I said something about your music to Jeanne? 
 You know what? (Scoffs) 
 You know I hate it when you do that. 
 D-Do what? 
 I don't need your help. Okay? 
 No, I... 
 I've got my band. My music Speaks for itself. 
 And what the hell was up with all that... 
 That writing process crap anyway? 
 I mean, since when did you become an expert in... 
 (sighs) 
 You know what? (Sighs) 
 I'm... I'm just gonna walk. 
 Baby, you can't walk home. Just get in the truck. 
 Scarlett... 
 (keys jangle) 
 Just let me go. 
 (Teddy) I thought the whole thing went pretty Well, yeah? 
 Yeah. Uh-huh. But why didn't you tell me that, uh, old Peggy is on the host committee? 
 I don't know. It never even crossed my mind. 
 Uh-huh. 
 She's still got the hots for you. 
 What's that? 
 What's that? What's that? 
 Uh, she's got the hots for me? Uh, I don't think so. 
 (sets down glasses) It's been 15 years. 
 What are you getting at anyway? 
 I don't know. Just... 
 (whispers) Peggy. 
 (pops) 
 (normal voice) And the country club and those people. Just... 
 Well, those people... they're your people. 
 (gasps) They are not my people. 
 Mm-hmm. 
 They're daddy's people. 
 They're your people now, mister. 
 (chuckles) Well, I gotta beat Coleman somehow, right? (Sets down Glass) 
 Yeah, I have a very different World view from most of those people. 
 That's true. 
 Does seem like every woman in there would probably make a better politician's wife than I do. 
 Honey, look, let... Let me tell you something now. 
 I didn't marry you because you'd be a good politician's wife. 
 Why did you marry me? 
 Because... 
 Well, because, honestly, you... 
 You dazzle me. 
 And you always have. 
 I love you. 
 You're gonna be great tomorrow night. 
 Hey, baby. 
 Look, honey, I know you're upset. 
 But, honey, everything's gonna be just fine. 
 But look, you got a big ol' interview tomorrow and you gotta eat something. I'm not hungry. 
 (singsongy) It's pink macaroni. It's your favorite. 
 You know, I made it just... Just like you like it, with the ketchup and the big ol' dollop of cream cheese and... 
 I don't eat that crap. You might, but I don't. 
 You know what? I am just tryin' to help here. 
 I'm... by what, pretending to be a good mother? 
 (dish clatters) 
 Huh? 
 Like I'd buy that for a second? 
 Like I don't see you pawing everything in This place looking for what you can get your hands on to sell for drugs? 
 (breathing heavily) 
 What are you... What's in this? 
 Give me that. No. What are you hiding? 
 Give it... what are you hiding?! 
 I trust you about as far as I can throw you. 
 What's in here, huh? 
 (objects clatter) 
 (coin rattles) 
 (sniffles) 
 Are you happy now?! 
 (crying) 
 Hi. 
 Hi. 
 Mm. 
 (grunts) 
 On a scale from I to 10, how... awkward is this gonna be at work? 
 Well... just so you know, I plan on making it incredibly awkward. 
 This can just be a onetime thing. 
 You know, no pressure, no "what does this mean?" there's no reason to make this, uh, more than what it was. 
 You know, if I didn't have firsthand proof to the contrary, I'd accuse you of being a dude.

 Okay, the interview will be via satellite with Robin Roberts... 
 An exclusive that'll air on "G.M.A." tomorrow morning. 
 Now we have a great relationship with Robin. 
 She's always fair, but thorough. 
 Did you get a chance to check the prep document? 
 What prep document? 
 Right. Right. 
 Okay, So, uh... she's gonna ask you why you did this, obviously. 
 She'll say you have plenty of money. 
 You don't need to steal. 
 She'll ask you what kind of example this sets for your young fans. 
 She'll bring up other celebrities with similar scandals... Winona, Lindsay... 
 W... I-I didn't rob Saks, okay? 
 I don't have three D.U.I.s. 
 I mean, it's not like I'm some white-Trash lowlife who was caught raising roosters to peck each other's eyes out here. 
 It was a freakin' bottle of nail polish. 
 Okay. 
 What you just did... don't do that. 
 I can't defend myself. 
 No. It'll just make things worse. 
 You have an image to protect. 
 Your brand depends on this. 
 You spent a lot of time hiding where you came from. 
 The last thing you want is to expose it now. 
 Just stay on message. 
 I got it. 
 Just be honest, okay? 
 Take responsibility for every... 
 I said I got it. 
 I'll just be honest. 
 What's going on, Scar? 
 I don't know what I'm doing here. 
 You mean hanging out with your uncle? 
 Kind of embarrassing? 
 (laughs) 
 Not "here" here. 
 Nashville here. 
 I came out here to be with Avery... 
 Support him, have a life with him. 
 He has been scuffling so hard for so long, and Gunnar and I get this deal without even half trying. 
 I think Gunnar's been trying for a little while, so... 
 I get this deal without even half trying. 
 That's even worse. 
 Well, look... (sighs) 
 I'm no expert at giving advice, but... people grow. 
 Not always at the same rate. 
 I can tell you it's not easy being the one who's always struggling to catch up. 
 But, scar, there's not much you can do about that, sweetie. 
 Avery's either gonna keep up or... he's gonna get left behind. That's it. 
 (clatters) 
 Do you have a cigarette? 
 You don't smoke. 
 I know. I just want to hold it. 
 Where the hell is Deacon? 
 I-I texted him. He'll be here. 
 (clatters) 
 You know he refuses to text. 
 Are you nervous? 
 Uh, yeah, I think I'm a little bit nervous. 
 You know... being back here at the country club, all that, you know, just... 
 Rayna, these are your people. They're gonna love you. 
 These are not my people. 
 Why does everybody keep saying these are my people? 
 These are not my people. 
 These are the people who made fun of me in high school for liking country music. 
 Well, everyone has graduated, and now you are a big star. 
 So, hey, enjoy the last laugh. 
 Will you please just go find me a cigarette to hold? 
 Yes, I can. 
 Thank you. 
 (Robin Roberts) Thank you so much for joining us. 
 We know you're a busy woman, preparing for your upcoming tour. 
 Well, thank you very much for having me, Robin. 
 A lot's been swirling around in the media, on the internet, and we wanted to give you a chance to set the record straight. 
 I appreciate that. 
 We've obviously seen this before with other celebrities. 
 Most recently, uh, Lindsay lohan. 
 Before that, Winona Ryder. 
 Even Farrah Fawcett back in the day. 
 Like them, you are obviously a person with success, with money. 
 How do you explain this video? 
 Actually, there's a very simple explanation for it. 
 Everybody wants to be young and famous and rich, and I am, and people are very jealous. 
 Wait a minute. 
 So you're maintaining you did nothing wrong? 
 I put the nail polish in my purse because I didn't want it to fall through the basket, and then I didn't get a chance to pay for it because I was very distracted, because as usual, it's very difficult for me to leave my house without being followed or, uh, harassed. 
 And, um... that's the problem with being on top... is that people aren't just waiting for you to fall. 
 They're trying to cause you to. 
 I imagine the scandal has been hard on you and your mother. 
 Sorry? 
 Is it true she was arrested for possession of drugs and was... 
 This interview's over. 
 (murmuring) 
 (door opens) 
 Sorry I'm late. 
 All right, great. 
 Y'all, can y'all please clear out? 
 (exhales deeply) Thank you, Emily. 
 Did you not get my text? I don't do texts. 
 So finally you decided to grace us with your presence. 
 How you doin', Lamar? Good to see you. 
 No, no, no, just take your time. There's no rush. 
 All right. Come on, Lamar. Let's let them get ready. 
 I guess we can still count on you bein' underdressed. 
 I mean, hell, it's only $1,400 a ticket. 
 So there's no need for you to look presentable or anything. 
 You know what? I'm only doing this for Rayna, okay? 
 It's called a favor. 
 Why would you begrudge one tiny little favor for a family that's carried you on its back for 20 years? 
 Carried me? (Chuckles) 
 I think you got me confused with someone else. 
 I'm gonna do this thing, but I'm not gonna kiss your ass while I'm doing it. 
 That's his job. 
 Whoa. What the hell, Deacon? 
 I didn't even ask you to do this. 
 We have a show to do. Someone did. 
 You think I want you to be here right now? Please. 
 Because I'm not gonna stand here and be insulted. 
 No, but you'll sure as hell stand by and watch... come on. 
 While somebody else insults me. 
 Deacon. I'm here to help you. 
 Hell, I'm not even voting for you. 
 Well, damn. There goes my campaign. 
 Hey, guys, we got a show starting right about now. Yeah, what campaign? 
 This whole town knows you're nothing but a straw man for him. 
 What you know about politics couldn't even fill a shot glass. 
 Shut up! Shut up! I know a prize pig when I see it. 
 Shut up! Are you drinking again? Is that it? 
 Please. (Speaks indistinctly) Teddy boy? 
 Teddy, Teddy. Can we just get this over with? 
 (door opens) 
 (indistinct conversations) 
 The tease for the "G.M.A." Interview is already all over the internet. 
 (Makena) Walkout included? Walkout included. 
 (cell phone rings and beeps) Oh, god. I gotta take this. 
 Y-Yeah... (speaking indistinctly) 
 (woman) They're even promoting it on Kimmel tonight. 
 When the label sees this, we're toast. 
 No, I understand. 
 How bad? 
 Performance international's just pulled out of the tour. 
 Sponsors are bailing. Uh, they don't have any choice. 
 What does that mean? 
 It means that your tour, for now, it's off. 
 (applause) 
 Hello! 
 Welcome, everybody. Welcome. (Chuckles) 
 I hope y'all are having a good time, 'cause I sure am. 
 (cheering) 
 You know, I look out here, and I see so many familiar faces. 
 We are all... one family in this town, which makes this evening especially meaningful. 
 I-I'm so appreciative of y'all coming out to support one of our own and a man who I am proud to have as my son-in-law... 
 The next mayor of Nashville... 
 Mr. Teddy Conrad. 
 (cheering) 
 (mouths words) 
 And, folks, continuing in the family tradition, it's also my privilege to introduce the other superstar in my family... 
 My daughter... 
 The great Rayna James. 
 (cheering) 
 (mouths word) 
 (playing "Changing Ground") 
 How y'all doin'? 
 (cheering) 
 (Rayna) Great to see you.

 I don't even know what that Teddy stuff was. 
 You don't know what that was? No. 
 Seemed to me like it was you taking the bait. 
 (sighs) 
 I don't know what you were thinking. 
 Shoot, you're not only self-destructive, you're just destructive. 
 (sighs) 
 I can't believe you put us in this position. 
 Which "us," Ray? 
 Huh? Which us? 
 I thought you needed me. 
 (voice breaking) I do need you. 
 I don't even know what to do with that anymore. 
 Well, I don't know what to do either. 
 But now I'm gonna have to go home. 
 We done here? 
 Yeah, we're done. 
 (door closes) 
 I can't deal with it anymore. 
 I know. 
 I'm your husband. 
 I'm firing him. 
 Hey. 
 Hey. 
 I know you don't want to talk about this, but, um... how long are we not gonna talk about it? 
 'cause I think we need to. 
 (sighs) 
 I don't want to feel bad about this deal, Avery. 
 I really want to do this. 
 I wanna write. 
 And I'd love it if you could support me like I support you. 
 I'm trying. 
 Okay? 
 Okay.

 Thanks for coming. 
 This is torture. 
 At the club last night, I-I felt sick. 
 I know. 
 I'm really sorry about that. 
 (sighs) This... This campaign... It changes everything. 
 I mean, they've really been digging into my past. 
 Teddy, someone's gonna find out. 
 (sighs) It's only a matter of time. 
 Okay, well, that's what I'm hoping to avoid. 
 You haven't told anybody, have you? 
 No. I haven't breathed a word of this to anyone. 
 Teddy, we've kept this secret a long time, but maybe it's better if we come clean now, on our own terms. 
 Peggy, look, what we did was really stupid, but you cannot... 
 You cannot say a word to anyone. 
 My campaign, my marriage, my entire family depends on it, and yours, too. 
 (sighs) 
 (knock on door) 
 Hey. 
 Hey. 
 We need to talk. 
 I don't think this is working... you and me. 
 Are you dropping me? 
 My job is to give you the best advice I can. 
 Whatever problems you had before... 
 That interview made them exponentially worse. 
 I know. 
 I know. 
 (exhales deeply) 
 Please don't do this. 
 I want my tour back, I want my image restored, and I will do whatever it takes. 
 And I'll listen to you. 
 I promise. 
 I-I need to ask you a question. 
 And if you want me to stay, I need an honest answer. 
 Why'd you do it? 
 Why'd you take the nail polish? 
 It's something I used to do when I was a kid. 
 And it may sound funny to you, but... it made me feel like I could take care of myself when nobody else would. 
 Okay. 
 From now on, you listen. 
 You listen to every word I say. 
 Yeah. 
 All right, tomorrow morning, we regroup. 
 Look, don't just sit here all alone. Call a friend. 
 Try to get your mind off this stuff a little bit, okay? 
 I don't have friends. 
 I have people who want to be seen with me. 
 Well... used to. 
 All right. I'll see you in the morning. 
 (phone rings) 
 (beeps) 
 Hello? 
 (mouth full) Deacon, hey. 
 Um, it's me. 
 It's Juliette. 
 I know who "me" is, Juliette. 
 I hate to call you like this. I just, uh... 
 Uh, it's okay. 
 You all right? 
 Not really. 
 Hey. You doing anything right now?
