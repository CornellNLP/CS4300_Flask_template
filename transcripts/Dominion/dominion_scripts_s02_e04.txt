 male narrator : Previously on  Dominion... 
 You can bring back a souvenir, the head of Claire Riesen. 
 The only thing that spared your life is your service to this city. 
 You think you're gonna get away with this? 
 You won't get away with this. 
 Gates, I need you to find someone for me. 
 Zoe Holloway. 
 She's a V-1, wants to overthrow my government. 
 Give me an hour, and I'll see what I can do. 
 A few days ago an angel stole a key from me, and I'd like you to bring it to me. 
 That is General Edward Riesen of Vega, part of the pact between our two cities, which you now owe me. 
 I banish your spirit to the outer sphere. 
 Aah! 
 Oh! 
 Aah! 
 [whimpers] 
 No, no. No! 
 No! 
 Aah! 
 Aah! 
 Julian : Ooh, that's pretty. 
 Come to daddy. 
 [gun clicks] 
 How many? 
 A cache of 20. 
 100 credits, find more. 
 See, this is the key, Alex. 
 This is the key to winning this war. 
 A few guns won't stop Gabriel. 
 No, no, no. 
 Angels and humans working together will. 
 I mean, look at the big picture, Alex. 
 Huh? After Gabriel, then what? 
 I mean, there are millions of angels on earth. 
 You're never gonna kill them all. 
 You mean eight-balls living in human bodies they stole. 
 There'll be no future for anyone if we don't stop Gabriel. 
 And he will come for me. 
 You promised me an alliance, an army. 
 But all I see as I look around is a scared city preparing for a siege. 
 Well, Alex, you know, I'm gonna protect my city first. 
 What about Vega? 
 You sent my message. Did you hear anything back? 
 Oh, it's gonna take at least a week for our trucks to cross the wasteland. 
 When we walked into this city, there were five trucks out front. 
 There are still five there. 
 Mm, well, that's not our only convoy, Alex. 
 I did what you asked. 
 I got your key. 
 When are you gonna honor your side of the bargain and give me the alliance? 
 Hell, the army that you promised? 
 Now, we will help each other because that's our way here in New Delphi. 
 Okay? 
 Excuse me. 
 He's stalling. He's hiding something. 
 We need to know why. 
 Help me! Please! 
 [groans] 
 [voice distorted] Dirty Davey, you banged an eight-ball. 
 We should've hanged you. 
 You banged an eight-ball. 
 We should have hanged you. 
 Aah! 
 We should have hanged you. 
 [panting] 
 [gasps] 
 Aah! 
 Here he is. Come on! 
 [indistinct yelling] 
 Go, come on! 
 Oh! 
 Nice and cozy down here, isn't it? 
 Of course you're here. 
 Where else would I be? 
 I mean, after all, Claire and Arika took our tower, froze your assets, hijacked your allies, ruined our family name. 
 Oh, you did enough to that. 
 Admit it, Dad, they got you good. 
 No. You don't have the blood of a survivor, but I do. 
 If the angels weren't the death of me, then Claire Riesen certainly won't be. 
 Aah! 
 [indistinct sports casting] 
 [buzzer] 
 Claire, I wasn't expecting company today. 
 Or ever, really. 
 I've been standing out there for five minutes. 
 You could see me. 
 Yeah, hoping you'd go away. 
 2004 ALCS. 
 Red Sox, Yankees. 
 Down three games to zip. 
 At this point, we had a 4.9% chance to come back and win it all, which is impossible. 
 Until a homer turned it all around, thanks to this guy, "Big Papi." 
 She got this for me. I was there. 
 My ma took me and we were up in the nosebleeds above Pesky's pole, and at the end of the game, she elbowed her way down to the field to get this signed. 
 I mean, there was no stopping that woman. 
 It's one of the last things Ma gave me. 
 What does it matter now anyway? 
 They're all dead. 
 You know, I watch this game when I can't fix a problem, and Zoe is a problem that I can't solve. 
 I don't know what is in that crate. 
 I've checked the armories. Nothing's missing. 
 Okay, I need a list from you. 
 All the condemned structures in this city, I want soldiers to search them. 
 Rebels have got to be somewhere. 
 Okay, well, sure. I'll get right on it. 
 Things were bad enough with the angels, and now we have an enemy in our own walls. 
 I'll deal with the rebels. If you want to help, great. 
 And if you don't, well, enjoy the rest of the game. 
 Did you bring someone with you? 
 No! I followed the protocol you established with my dad. 
 I just snuck right out. That is what you wanted. 
 Nobody knows I'm here. 
 Okay, then who is that? 
 sh1t. It must be one of Zoe's people. 
 He's followed me here. 
 Oh, that's really cute. Hold up. I got this.

 Enjoying yourself, Janeck, hmm? 
 A little music, little bourbon. 
 Whiskey. 
 I was waiting at the gates of New Delphi for an army that never arrived, an army my herald was ordered to call. 
 Tell me, Janeck, why was that? 
 'Cause I never summoned them. 
 You failed with a human. 
 You couldn't unlock his markings. 
 The aerie was bombed, good soldiers died. 
 And for what? 
 Father hasn't come back, maybe he never will. 
 Ragh! 
 He will, and I'll be the one to bring him home. 
 But if you doubt me, Janeck, you won't get to see it.

 William : Dad, you don't want to sleep through your own death. 
 Trust me, that last burst of adrenaline is killer. 
 [laughs] 
 [moans] 
 William : Aren't you excited? 
 [gasps] 
 Excited about what? 
 To die. 
 You finally get to be face-to-face with your maker. 
 Oh, wait, that's right, you lost your faith. 
 [laughs] 
 It's ironic that when angels descend from heaven with concrete proof of God's existence, you lose your faith. 
 I won't believe in a God whose angels slaughtered my family. 
 William : You helped in that slaughter. 
 I must say, I can't wait to see how it all ends. 
 I don't think I'll have to wait long. 
 These people won't kill me. 
 [laughs] 
 That's all you have left to offer, Dad. 
 Just your life. 
 Come on, get up. 
 Wait. 
 [groaning] 
 Let's shoot him in the head and throw his body in the streets. 
 No. No, I'm not gonna waste this opportunity. 
 Zoe, right? 
 You're Zoe. I know all about you. 
 We can make a deal, come on. 
 We could... we could come to an agreement. 
 Jasper : We don't have time for this. 
 We need to keep moving. They found our safe house, Zoe. 
 We need a new place to hide. 
 This will just take a few minutes. 
 The death of David Whele needs to be recorded. 
 With that and this, the V-1s will be lining up to join us. 
 Please, I can help you. 
 [groans] 
 Don't think they're really in the mood to talk. 
 Pete : Dude's gotta have more than five trucks in all of New Delphi, Alex. 
 Maybe, but I know he's lying. 
 He never sent that message to Vega. 
 But Julian gave you that New Delphi alliance thing. 
 No, he gave us a promise. 
 Well, a promise isn't much help to my daughter, or your baby she's carrying. 
 What? You knocked up his daughter? 
 Pete, sit down. 
 Listen, listen, this is our chance to end all of this, but we can't do it on our own. 
 Julian promised us an army. So where is it? 
 Maybe he lied, he doesn't have one. 
 Riesen : No. 
 Oh, he may be lying about the message to Vega, but he's telling the truth about the power of New Delphi. 
 Somehow this city has defied Gabriel for 25 years. 
 Something Vega couldn't do and we had Michael on our side. 
 He has something formidable enough to keep them safe. 
 Then I'm gonna find it. 
 General, I need you to buy me some time with Julian. 
 Noma, you're coming with me. 
 You're not gonna leave me here, are you? 
 You don't leave this room. 
 We're lucky we made it this far. 
 But if anyone figures out you were possessed, they're gonna ask how. 
 No one here can know what I can do. 
 You got it? 
 Yeah. 
 It doesn't seem like Zoe's style to send someone to do her dirty work. 
 Here comes the cavalry.

 Where's Alex? 
 Your friends in Vega bombed my aerie. 
 Noma escaped, but Alex died there. 
 Uriel was there, too. 
 Our little sister, she's dead. 
 Uriel. 
 Don't. 
 You're lying about Uriel. 
 I'm not. 
 And you're lying about Alex. 
 He's alive! 
 Lying? 
 You think a human could survive something that killed one of our own?

 Are you really going to do this?

 Feeling better? 
 He can't cut this power. 
 The generator's lines run inside. 
 [engine whirring] 
 Is that safe? 
 No, but in a world filled with abominations, death by immolation seems almost a comfort. 
 He didn't cut the feed. 
 He wants us to watch. 
 Claire : Is there any other way to reach outside? 
 Gates : No. 
 So tell me, Gates, is this place gonna hold against an angel? 
 That's nine inches of reinforced concrete and steel. 
 Even a higher angel can't get through that. 
 [loud banging] 
 You sure about that? 
 Zoe : You mutilated V-1s, amputated their hands for stealing food, You're a deviant who kept an eight-ball as a s*x toy. 
 You killed our children. 
 They know you well, Dad. 
 Murdered one with your bare hands. 
 What was that little girl's name? 
 [William laughs] 
 [groans] 
 Bixby. 
 Zoe : All right, Jasper, I know it feels good, but we got enough. 
 Thank God. 
 Seems a little late for that. 
 Zoe : They'll sweep this area soon. We gotta go. 
 Shoot him. 
 No. Please... please, God, no. 
 Better, but dig deeper, Dad. 
 Can you find a spark of that faith that once burned in your heart? 
 Wait! I can help you! 
 How... how long do you think you're gonna last in a walled city? 
 [laughs softly] Longer than you. 
 No, I can show you a place to hide. 
 You can't stage a revolution running from tunnel to warehouse. 
 It's only a matter of time. 
 Hold up, Jasper. 
 [beep] 
 You have ten seconds, Whele. 
 I used to be a preacher in a public access station in old Las Vegas. 
 It's safe, and there's a generator. 
 Zoe, he's just spinning. 
 Of course he is. 
 But we can kill him now or in 30 minutes. 
 Either way, he's still dead. 
 Take us there. 
 Under the sheetrock, this place is lined floor to ceiling with steel that was scavenged from old casino vaults. 
 He's searching for a seam, looking for a flaw. 
 Are there any? 
 Of course there are. Everything has a weakness. 
 Well, that's not helpful, is it? 
 Well, it's reality. 
 And this is reality come to life. 
 You know, you were born inside these walls. 
 You don't know war. 
 [engine whirring] 
 That's the basement. 
 He's headed down there. 
 It's too dark for the cameras and him. 
 The dark's not gonna slow him down anyway. 
 Angel eyes are more sensitive than ours. 
 They are? 
 Oh, so there's something the genius doesn't know after all. 
 I bet I have something to fix those cameras. 
 [rumbling] 
 What the hell is that? 
 He's trying to break through. 
 Gates! 
 Claire! 
 Okay, listen, Gates, when I move this, pull your leg out, okay? Fast. 
 Okay. 
 Go! Go! 
 
 
 
 [groans] 
 Get up. 
 Whoa, Gates! 
 sh1t. 
 Julian. 
 Hey, General. 
 Or is it Edward now? 
 'Cause when you left your post, you left your rank. 
 I did. 
 All these years as leaders of the Cradle, and we've never had the pleasure of meeting. 
 Well, now you understand why. 
 We don't share philosophies on the possessed. 
 How well do you know Gabriel? 
 Ooh, better than you, I'd wager. 
 I managed to keep him out of Vega for 25 years, as have you. 
 But now, thanks to Alex, he's coming here. 
 We have to prepare for battle. 
 I have defenses in place. 
 You don't win wars with defense. 
 No. You do it with a trap. 
 What trap? 
 Let us help you. 
 Gabriel's been at the top of the food chain for thousands of years. 
 Well, hundreds of thousands. 
 Which is precisely his flaw. 
 He sees us as mites to be swatted. 
 If we were to kill an angel, we had better think like one. 
 [laughs] 
 Get General Riesen a drink. 
 Some of the good stuff. 
 Yes, sir. 
 Come on, let's talk. 
 I saw Julian come down here yesterday. 
 He would want to keep anything important as close as possible. 
 Like that? 
 Exactly. 
 Move. 
 Nice. 
 Here. 
 Need a little leverage. 
 Wait, Alex. Something feels wrong here. 
 We need to find what Julian is hiding.

 But is it part of God's plan? 
 God isn't here. 
 [gasps] Neither is your gun. 
 What we have here is an amped-up version of a prank we used at MIT, electrifying our dorm doorknobs. 
 Way amped up. 
 This would kill a human twice over who touches that steel door. 
 You'll be okay, but just do not step off that rubber mat.

 Thanks for the tip on this place. 
 Love the decor, but it's a little cramped, so... 
 Wait. 
 Did you really think we weren't gonna kill you? 
 William : Actually, no. 
 He thought he was gonna find a 35-year-old gun and shoot you both in the face. 
 Shut up! 
 Who the hell are you talking to? 
 Wait, wait. I can still help you. 
 You are, David. Your life was a waste, but your death will give our people hope, strength. 
 Strength? Starving people can't fight. 
 But I can get you food. 
 I have the access codes to the storage warehouses. 
 You can slip in and out unnoticed. 
 And if they change my codes, I know all the other V-6s'. 
 You can feed your people, Zoe. 
 Send someone to check it out. 
 All right. All right. All right. All right. 
 You just bought yourself another 30 minutes. 
 The anticipation is killing me. 
 Julian : See, here's your Petey. 
 Safe and sound. 
 Early in our occupation of this facility, we were attacked by Rhais, a higher angel, one of Gabriel's lieutenants. 
 And she would have wiped us out but for a nest of what you call eight-balls hiding in these tunnels. 
 They saved us. 
 And together we founded New Delphi. 
 And what I learned from these angels was something that no one knew. 
 That 25 years ago every lower angel that was powerful enough to possess and inhabit a human, did. 
 But that still left millions of lower angels lost in the darkness. 
 And that's where they were damned to remain, unless someone helped them find a human home. 
 Rhais was special. 
 Catching her was invaluable because she knew exactly how to use this, the very thing that has made New Delphi great and something that could still make Vega great as well. 
 Thanks to you, Alex. 
 Not a sword, or a gun, but an amphora made of empyrean steel was the first weapon of New Delphi. 
 Ah, ah, ah, ah. 
 Now, we had a weak and untrained people, but we needed an army. 
 And Rhais taught us how to create that army by pulling lower angels down from the ether.

 No, this city's the best chance we have of taking Gabriel out. We need Julian's help. 
 How are we gonna make him do that? 
 I don't know, but I know a place that's safe until we figure it out. 
 And I'm not sure how all this ends anymore. 
 Not with the extinction of the human race. 
 Father's house was infested. 
 When it's clean, he'll come back. 
 You're a fool, Gabriel. 
 We are his children, but so are they. 
 Father made that very clear. 
 The Chosen One is human. 
 No. 
 Father gave the markings to you. 
 You went against his will and gave them to Jeep. 
 Then they went to Alex. 
 You chose Alex. 
 You made him the Chosen One. 
 The markings were meant for Alex. 
 That was Father's will.

 You know, the TV show I did from this studio was not very good, but some powerful moments that shaped my life happened here.

 Every week I had an hour to preach to an audience of maybe 50, all lonely and late-night insomniacs. 
 [distorted voices] ...I want you. 
 Now, we know God didn't give a damn about my TV audience. 
 He didn't care about who won the Super Bowl. 
 He didn't care about any of us. 
 But at that time, I believed he sent that boy to teach me a lesson. 
 Chad, you don't want to die. Please, let's pray. 
 He wanted me to think big. 
 So I listened, and I posted that clip of... of Chad on the Internet and my audience grew from 50 to millions overnight. 
 Minus one. 
 Chad hung himself when you kicked him out of church. 
 He was weak. 
 A few months ago, I-I dropped my son off in a desert with a gun and six bullets. 
 I'm assuming he killed himself, 'cause like Chad, he was weak. 
 William : Weak? I broke you. 
 I made you believe in something again. 
 No, William, you distracted me.

 It's one of the archangel's weapons, given to them by our Father. 
 This is the fifth Amphora, darkness. 
 "And the fifth angel poured its vial "and his kingdom was full of darkness, and they gnawed their tongues for pain." 
 And Julian uses it to possess humans. 
 It doesn't work that way. 
 I think that the lower angels are drawn to it because it's the last remnants of God's power. 
 They find it, and Julian guides them into a human body.

 You can't. 
 Only an angel can unseal one of the seven Amphorae.

 Oh, now, come on, Alex. 
 If you know what that is, then you know that you can't use that. 
 No. 
 But she can. 
 Alex, what is that?

 Alex : You're an eight-ball. 
 No. He's a dyad. 
 Half human, half higher angel fused together, living in a single body. 
 I never thought they existed. 
 Well, they do. Just be careful with that, Noma. 
 Why do you have it?

 Fitting that it's the plague of darkness that helps the lower angels who've suffered in darkness in a penal system created by the archangels. 
 But if necessary, I can use it to kill Gabriel and Michael and their whole family. 
 Good, then we agree. 
 You promised me a way to kill Gabriel.

 He dies, or we all die. 
 The choice is yours.
