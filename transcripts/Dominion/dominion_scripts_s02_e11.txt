 Previously on "Dominion"...  
 The added stress of surgery caused a miscarriage. [screams] What did you do? What I had to! I've been chosen. These are my markings. This is the fifth Amphora. Darkness. It's one of the archangel's weapons. "And his kingdom was full of darkness,  and they gnawed their tongues for pain." If you unlock the Amphora, it'll wipe us all out,  angels and humans. I know. [dramatic music] ♪ ♪ [hisses] ♪ ♪ [electricity crackles] ♪ ♪ Oh, no, you're absolutely right. ♪ ♪ [electrical buzzing] What was that? Find out what's going on...  [nervous chatter] [gun clicks] Sanders? No! [gunshot] [gasps] [grunting] ♪ ♪ [screams] [gunfire] [screams] [overlapping shouts] [gunshots] [overlapping shouts] [both grunting] [explosion booms] [screams] [gunfire] [explosion booms] [gunshot] Ah! [gunfire] [grunting] Alex! Help! Claire! [both grunting] [grunting] Get off me! Get off me! [grunting] [gunshot] [panting] [background sound fades out] [heartbeat thumping] [baby crying in distance] [background sound returns] [panting] Claire, stop! [overlapping shouting] Noma, go! [gunshot] [alarm blares] [gunshot ricochets] [panting] [baby crying in distance] [baby crying] [gentle music] ♪ ♪ Hello. ♪ ♪ My baby. My baby. I thought I lost you. [baby coos] It's okay. It's okay. Mommy's here. Mommy's here. Let's go. [ominous music] ♪ ♪ Please don't. Don't do this, please. Any... anything... anything you want, I can get it for you. Please! David Whele, by order of the Lady of the City, you have been sentenced to die. [whimpers] [gasps] Do you have any last words? Everything I did, I did it for Vega! [whimpering] ♪ ♪ Ah! Ah! Ah! ♪ ♪ [metallic thud] Stay of execution has been granted. You David Whele? Your presence has been requested. What? Please. What's happening? Am I free? Has Claire pardoned me? My sigil. ♪ ♪ My lord. ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ Hello, David. Boo! [gasps] [laughs] [dramatic music] ♪ ♪ Alex, wait! What the hell is this? It's the Amphora of Darkness. Brings out the darkness inside you. It drives you mad with visions to make you hurt yourself or someone else. Some are nightmares but some are dreams, beautiful but fatal, all end in death. Well, I'm not seeing anything, nightmares or dreams. Well, neither am I but angels can withstand its effects longer than humans. Doesn't explain you though. I gotta find Claire. No, no! The only way to help Claire is to find the Amphora and close it. No human can do it. Only an angel can reseal it. It's close. I can sense it nearby. I can feel it. Follow me. Let's go. [heartbeat thumping] [door opens] Claire, what have you done to me? [ominous music] ♪ ♪ Rose? A female 8-ball. This is exactly what we needed. An 8-ball? I'm not an 8-ball. Claire, what is she talking about? How does she know my name? This one's smart. She learns fast. I'm confident we can break her down,  train her for our purposes. Train me? You can't be serious. You're dead. Claire, I shot her, I swear! Calm yourself, or I'll remove your black eyes myself. Rose? This is too risky. If we release her to seduce David Whele, how do we know she won't kill him, or worse, us? David needs to be branded a traitor. It's the perfect plan. Destroy him or he'll destroy you. Claire, you must listen to me. Something is very wrong here. Please. Claire. Claire! Claire! Listen to me! Claire! [door closes] [heartbeat thumping] [indistinct shouts in distance] [grunts] [footsteps approaching] [shouting in distance] Okay. [yelps] Ah! [straining] Well, if it isn't my dear old acolyte. Been a long time, William. Gabriel? Are you the one that brought me here? Where am I? Don't you recognize it? [laughs] The desert heat must have been brutal. You took shelter here with your gun  and its six little bullets. Poor boy, thought you had escaped. Welcome back. I don't know what you're talking about. And I'm not afraid of you. That so? This tough exterior of yours is just a facade. I know the real you. Sniveling coward that served me all those years. No, I... [stammers] I'm not the same William anymore. I was chosen by God... our Father. Come now. It's embarrassing. You? The Chosen One? I am the Chosen One. I-I have the scars to prove it. Gabriel, I was tested in the desert, and I was saved by the grace of God. When everyone else deserted me, He never did. [grunts] God is gone! He left you too. You're not the Chosen One. You're a reject! Ah! [groans] Gabriel! [gunfire] [screams] [gunfire] We'll need to search all the floors. How the hell did the Amphora get inside the city? I don't know, but obviously Julian must have found it in New Delphi. [distant screaming] Quit it. I'm not seeing any visions or whatever. But you're human. You should have been affected by now. Perhaps he won't be. The Amphora brings out the darkness within, but Alex is the last pure heart. Meaning? Maybe there's no darkness inside you. [grunts] Help me. We need to split up. The Amphora's designed to preserve itself. It'll choose a victim to protect it. We need to hurry. He may not succumb, but you and I will. I'll search up here. I'll take this floor. ♪ Hush, little baby, don't say a word ♪ 
♪ Mama's gonna buy you a mockingbird ♪ 
♪ And if that mockingbird don't sing ♪ 
♪ Mama's gonna buy you a diamond ring ♪ Yes. Yes. How are my girls? Come here. Hard to believe this is our life sometimes, isn't it? [baby coos] You have no idea. Alex? What is it? You can't see that? See what? [breathing heavily] [distant screaming and gunfire] [exhales] Damn it. There's nothing in there either. What is it? Nothing. Come on. We need to find the Amphora, end this thing. Alex? We should split up. No, we already split from Michael. It's too dangerous. We need to stick together. I'm a soldier. I can handle myself. I'll be fine, I swear. Okay. Just be careful. Yeah. Ah. What is this? Is this some kind of a trick? You're... me. Well, now you're just stating the obvious. It's time you and I had a little conversation about our destiny. Our destiny? These are dark times, David. And they grow darker. But there's a bright future ahead of you. Or there can be. It's up to you. You could be Lord of the City. You play your cards right, you can have one of these too. No. No. Look at you. You're not a lord. You're an eight-ball. Hey, I'm a survivor. The end of the day, that's all that matters. But you... you're holding me back. What do you want from me? Let it go. Embrace who you've become. Renounce your... humanity or whatever you call it. And become a monster like you. Bow down to the angels. Never. You can take my life, but my soul is my own, something you will never understand. Souls, David, really? Don't touch those. Each of these items represents the soul of a man or woman you destroyed on your way to power. And you kept them in a trophy case. Let's be honest, David. You've been a monster like me longer than you'd like to admit. Still stubborn, I see. Maybe this will help. That's private. Where did you get that? They have a strange desire for certain items. Who is she? Arika's mother. You remind me of her. That's mine. Give it back. [grunts] I don't want people to see her that way. Claire, please. [sobs] Now, are you ready to obey? Uh-huh. Michael. Michael. [choking] [flashlight clatters] No! Oops. [solemn music] Noma...  I'm ending this war. Something I should have done 25 years ago. Alex had to die. Father's markings are gone forever. Now, so is he. It's over, Michael. You failed. [screaming] [screams] Hear that, Michael? It's the end. The death of all God's creations. [screams] 
 
 [dramatic music] ♪ ♪ Noma. [screams] [grunting] No. No. [screeching] I missed you, baby. Mmm. Claire! What happened to you? That's no way to talk to your wife. What's wrong? Don't you think I'm pretty anymore? That's not what I meant. Because I want you, William. Mmm! This is another test from God for me. [laughing] You actually believe that sh1t? Well, I have news for you. You're a false prophet. You're wrong. I've transformed, changed. Shh! Stop! That blinding flash of light that saved you from the thieves? That wasn't a gift from God. That was the thief's gun backfiring on him. Mmm! It killed him. Dead, dead, dead. While you... you were cowering in the corner. My William. That's not true. I heard the voice of God, and he... Aah! [laughing] That was your voice. You were talking to yourself. Mm-hmm. See all this? This is what really happened. You were a prisoner to a pack of 8-balls. They fed you rats. They did... unspeakable things to you. And it was fun. No miracles. Just you... and your stupid mind justifying the disgusting things that happened to you. Oh! I see you miss me too, William. But you're no chosen one. No. You're nothing. You're delusional, weak. You always were. Who could ever love you? You're safe now. Do we have any reason to fear you? No. Good girl. [whimpers] Your mother was a lunatic. She was diagnosed as bipolar when you very young. She saw things that weren't there. She needed help. But she didn't want it. She hurt you. She didn't know what she was doing. You thought she was a monster. No, I loved my mother. You're afraid of her. Afraid of becoming her. Now... recite your lines. No. I said... recite your lines. I don't want to fight anymore, David. Don't treat me like this. Good. You're ready. Now strip. I'm offering you everything you've ever wanted. Yes. Lord of the City, but not like this. You're inhuman. So are you. You killed innocents. You tried to assassinate Claire. You conned Zoe into a war. You left your own son in the desert to die. I had to. Those things I did in order to survive. Unh! Oh! Let's be blood brothers. I was a husband, a father. I had a family! I loved them dearly. I lost it all! Tell me, how does that make me inhuman? Yes, you loved them, and when they were taken, it changed you. [whimpers] Woman: David. Help us, Daddy. Charles? Peggy? Eleanor! [snarling] Love is a liability, a distraction. It's what's been holding you back. That's why you pushed William away. No, it was his crying that lead them to where we were hiding. It was his fault that they died. Now was it? Aah! [groaning] The war was the best thing that ever happened to you because it made you the man you were meant to be. Me. You love your Daddy, huh? She can't stop watching you. So cute. Such a big girl. You hungry? Maybe Daddy could get you something. I'll get her bottle. [glasses clinking] Hey. Is Daddy gonna feed you? Hmm? What is it? Is it too hot? No, it's... it's nothing. Alex... where'd the crib go? What crib? We have to get out of here. You have to trust me. We have to... We have to get out of here now. Alex, listen to me. We have to... [Willow crying] I'm seeing... Just... just wait. It's okay. It's okay, sweetie. Alex, I... Alex? [Willow continues crying] Alex? [crying stops] Willow? Alex? W-where's Willow? [sobbing] No! Wait. Where are you going? Outside. Come on. But I thought you said you could sense the Amphora in here. Maybe I was wrong. Ah! Put it down. What are you doing? Something's wrong with you. Something's off. Unh! Get away from him! I trusted you. That day, you said you'd protect him with your life, but you've been waiting for a chance to kill him, haven't you? No! Archangel, no, I promised you. Lies! I know what's in your heart. Back off, Michael. You don't know what you're saying. It's the Darkness talking. You don't know her, Alex. She's hiding something. Get back! You can't have it! Wait, what are you talking about? The Amphora. She has the Amphora. Stay here. I think I know where she hid it. Alex. Alex, get back here! Alex, stop! Tell me the truth, Michael. Alex. All you care about... are my markings. I don't mean anything to you. Is it true? No, of course not. These are all you care about! Only at first. You were just a tiny infant. How could so helpless a creature bring my father back? So, for a time, yes, the markings were all I cared for. But as the boy who would carry them grew, I saw that he was good and kind and brave. No father could be prouder of any son. It's not enough, Michael. [gunshot] [gasps] [crying] [solemn music] ♪ ♪ [screams] What are you holding on to, David? There's no one left to fight for except yourself. Survive. Your humanity is hanging by a thread. Cut it. Bow down to me. All the horrible things I've done... You're right... about me. About everything. [crying] Very good. [grunts] [screaming] [crying] Get up. Alex? What are you doing here? You've been spreading lies, William. What lies? Tell me, who am I? You're Alex. [grunts] Who am I? Who am I, William? Why are you doing this? Yeah, there's an easy answer. You see these? These are my markings, so let me ask you again. Who am I? Don't make me say it. [gunshot] Who am I? You're... you're... you're the Chosen One. Who am I? You're the Chosen One! That's right! And you're not. Your scars are just... deformities. They mean nothing. You mean nothing. Your marriage to Claire means nothing. [breathing heavily] No. [sobs] My markings... my markings are gone. You know what to do. [sobbing] I don't want to fight anymore, David. Hello? David? Seducing David was never the mission, Arika. Killing you was. Oh, please. Don't do this. Look at you. Helpless, crazy. Like mother, like daughter. No, I'm not her. [screams] Please. I-I did everything you asked of me. Have mercy. You never showed me mercy, so why should I? Get on your knees. Rose... what I did, killing you, it was so wrong. I am so sorry. Please forgive me. Forgive me. [soft thud] Stop. Are you going to kill me again? [door closes] [intermittent screams] Help me! Nomes? Stop! Don't come any closer! Get back! Okay, okay. We need to close the Amphora. It lies. Whatever it's telling you, it's not real. They are real. I can see them. I won't let you take them away again. Take what away? Noma. Get back! Noma, you're gonna fall. I won't. I can fly. You can't! It's the Darkness. It's tricking you. Your wings aren't back. Get back, or I'll fly away with it. If you jump, you'll die. I gave them up once. I did it for you, Alex. I won't do it again. I need them to go home again. How else will I fly back to Heaven? They're a part of me. And you're a part of me. Please don't do this! I need you. You're my Nomes forever. I need you. Come to me. [gasps] Alex? Alex? [screams] I got you. I'm here. I'm here. I got you. Noma, I can't close this, and Michael is too far gone. You can do this, Noma. Alex, get away from her! Michael, no! [grunts] Stop! Stop! Stop! It's the Darkness! Stop! Stop! [grunts] Michael! Michael, no! Get back, Alex! She wants you dead. [groans] Michael, please, it's not real! It's the Darkness! It's not real! None of it's real! We need to close the Amphora! I should've done this long ago. Get on your knees. [grunts] [suspenseful music] ♪ ♪ [chorus singing] ♪ ♪ [dramatic music] ♪ ♪ How did you do that? [gasps] [whimpers] I'm so sorry. Your wings. I'm so sorry. [crying] ♪ ♪ [dramatic alternative music] ♪ ♪ What have I done? ♪ ♪ [screaming] [choking] ♪ ♪ [sobbing] ♪ ♪ I will kill them. I will kill them all. [sobbing] ♪ ♪ The Amphora of Darkness has served my kind for an eternity,  but now I realize it should've been destroyed long ago. We need to find out who survived. Come on. Be careful. Whoever did this will still be near. ♪ ♪ Well, that was rather quick. No matter. It's time.
