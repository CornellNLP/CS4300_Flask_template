 female narrator : 25 years ago, God disappeared. 
 The archangel Gabriel decided he must destroy mankind to bring God back, but the archangel Michael stood against his brother and fought on the side of humanity. 
 The war continues. 
 The Lady of the City gave three floors of the Wynn to the V-1s. 
 Make sure those floors are uninhabitable. 
 How am I supposed to change this city when he destroys everything I try and do? 
 To cowards, whom we all know die many times before their actual death. 
 How does your town exist? 
 The rest of the world may believe he's gone, but in Mallory, Alabama, God's very much alive. 
 And Alex? 
 He escaped. 
 All I need is his skin.

 I will be needing one of yours in return. 
 See, he's lost the ability to breathe. 
 He's very still, because he's dead, taken by a bullet from your gun. 
 So would you like to exchange your life for his? 
 Or would you prefer to trade one of your friends? 
 Why's he looking at me, man... 
 Pete, stop talking. 
 It's not a man. It's an 8-ball. 
 No, we don't use that term, do we? 
 Mm-mm. 
 You see? 
 What I did was acting on instinct. 
 You have to understand that this... humans with 8-balls... it's... it's not how it is out there. 
 See, that's what makes New Delphi unique, angels and humans living in peace in our underground paradise. 
 Look, we clearly have our differences, but I still believe we can help each other out.

 Five years ago, you were in the archangel corps, but you just disappeared, and no one's seen or heard from you since.

 You're the Lady of the City, the head of this rotting corpse.

 Hey, David. 
 I just thought I'd stop by, let you know your assassination attempt failed. 
 Am I supposed to have some idea what you're talking about? 
 Last night, a V-1 posing as one of my guards attacked me. 
 Naturally, I thought of you. 
 I'm flattered, but, Claire, killing you would be far too destabilizing in an already unstable world. 
 But, now you mention it, I've not been too happy with your leadership the past three months. 
 And now you're accusing me of attempted murder instead of the V-1s? 
 They're the ones who hate you, Claire.

 Claire, what do you think David is doing right now? 
 He's plotting your demise. 
 You said yourself, David needs to be silenced. 
 It can't be done with accusations. 
 He needs to be branded a traitor. 
 This is the perfect plan.

 If we did what he said, we would be spared.

 A young railroad engineer who aspires to be a soldier decides to single-handedly save his beloved train, called? 
 The General. 
 The General, from cowardly hijackers, the underlying question throughout being, "Is this man brave or is he foolish?" 
 And this next part is, without question, my favorite. 
 The glorious General falling to the river below, never to ride the rails again. 
 Now, the scene itself runs 98 seconds in length from beginning to end, and that, adventurer friend, is the time that you have to convince me that you are brave, not foolish. 
 I was a prisoner in Gabriel's aerie for three months. 
 He tortured me. 
 I escaped. 
 As you can imagine, he's gonna be really pissed. 
 I came here for an alliance with New Delphi to help me defeat Gabriel. 
 I want to unite the two greatest cities in the cradle... something that's never been done since the beginning of the war.

 Your heart is racing. 
 You know, fear is the common cause, but lying is a close second. 
 Why would I lie? 
 To save your skin. 
 My skin, along with yours, will be in the hands of an archangel if you don't take what I'm saying seriously. 
 You escaped from Gabriel? 
 You can understand why I'm suspicious. 
 I had help. 
 Vega dropped a bomb on Gabriel's aerie. 
 If you want to cut my throat, you go ahead. 
 But I'll die knowing that the leader of New Delphi wasn't brave, but the biggest fool I've ever met. 
 That's good. 
 Shotgun.

 Do you know her well? 
 Harper and I grew up together. 
 We're like sisters. 
 A couple of days back, she ran away. 
 Why would anyone want to run away? 
 The Prophet left rules for us to follow. 
 Told us Father wants the people of Mallory to live life with an open heart. 
 We make mistakes, same as anyone, sure, but when we do, we confess. 
 No secrets. No sins. 
 As the leader of the town, it's my job to take the confessions of each and every person. 
 Harper was reluctant to reveal her secrets. 
 I was pressuring her, and she ran away. 
 And now that she's returned? 
 That means she's ready to confess, and we can all move on. 
 The real question is, how do you know Harper?
