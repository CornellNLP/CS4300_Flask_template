 Previously on Dominion... 
 I've been chosen. This are my markings. 
 William... 
 William is dead. 
 We may have number, but Claire's got a hell of a lot more weapons. 
 Looking for somebody? 
 I'm looking for David Whele. 
 How's the darkness feel, Gabriel? 
 Does it tickle? 
 Clementine was my wife's name. 
 When the angels fell, she was possessed. 
 Over time, we became close. 
 Once evicted from from a human body, a lower angel doesn't cease to exist. 
 Edward. 
 Clamentine. 
 Vega is falling into civil war. 
 A dyad can help Claire to save the city. 
 Oh, Edward. 
 You could have been killed, Gates, and if you're that stupid, maybe you should've been. 
 Wait. That's Michael. 
 Alex. 
 - It's the Prophet. 
 Look, he's back. Mallory. Michael. Michael! [man shouts indistinctly] [horse neighs] [choir singing hymn] ♪ ♪ Welcome back, Michael. What's happening? Who are you? You don't know, archangel? You're the one who protects this town. You gave the people the fire that keeps eight-balls at bay. They call you "the Prophet." Many rules to solitaire. Without rules, there is no order. And I find order rather calming. But rules aren't just for games, Michael. How did I get back to Mallory? I brought you here. You made a promise in this church to honor my rules. Every five years a person would sacrifice themselves to purge this town of its sins. It worked beautifully... until you walked in. Did you think I wouldn't notice? [chuckles] That, uh, dagger you killed yourself with wasn't Empyrean steel, was it? What do you want? I want you dead, Michael. You promised to sacrifice your life for this town, and I'm here to make sure you keep your word. How long has he been like this? Two hours. I can't wake him. I don't understand. What could do this to an archangel? I've never seen Michael sick before. Core temperature readings are offline. Our communication links must have been hit. Let me see that. Where's Michael? Out of commission for now. How bad is it? Bad. Armed rebels took the nuclear reactor and sealed the exits. That sounds like Whele. Civil war's almost over. He's getting desperate. Claire, is he allowed to be in here? I'm Archangel Corps. Who are you? This is Gates Foley. He's Vega's lead engineer. Fill Alex in, maybe he can help. Sure. It's a fast neutron reactor. I used lead-bismuth eutectic for the coolant, and I added weapons-grade uranium to kick-start the reaction. Gates. [chuckles] Basically, they have a bomb, and they're not taking our calls. I'll go in. And do what, exactly? Lead a team, take back control. Now, why didn't I think of that? Bullets flying in a nuclear facility, I mean, what could possibly go wrong? Listen, New Delphi's army is coming. Add that to the list of our current shitstorm, Alex. With no control of the reactor, we have no way to power our defenses. Okay, why don't you let me look after the technical stuff, okay, kid? Claire, I'm telling you,  we need to take back that reactor right now. No, we need to get the radio up and talk these anarchists down. He's right, Alex. We can't go in, guns blazing. It's too risky. You have an hour to make contact. Be ready with a team if he can't. Don't worry, Claire, I got this. Edward? What's the matter? I feel strange, sort of off balance. You're adjusting, that's all. Oh. Julian said being a dyad is the perfect harmony between angel and human, but it doesn't feel that way to me. It takes time. I know giving over the Amphora to Julian wasn't an easy decision. Becoming a dyad didn't just save yourself. You saved me. Well, I couldn't have Julian harm you. We're safe now. Your heart? Ooh, I feel like a 20-year-old... only better. [door opens] [clears throat] Boss wants to see you. This I had to see for myself. Gabriel. Pleasure to finally meet you, General. [dramatic music] What's up? He says he'll only talk to the lady of the city. Name's Ramirez, V-2. Ramirez? He was Archangel Corps. Guess he had a change of heart. This is Lady Riesen. Uh-oh, Mom's home. Am I in trouble? Yeah, and whatever David Whele promised you, Daddy lied. Put down your arms and come out. In this kind of situation, I'm pretty sure the guy with the nuclear reactor usually calls the shots. Look, buddy, there's enough uranium 235 in that reactor  to send us all sky high. If the distributors, coolants, or core get even a hairline fracture... Ramirez, it's Sergeant Lannon. Lannon, I thought you left Vega. Yeah, I came back just in time to tell these guys how much of an asshole you are. [chuckles] What do you say we work this out, make sure no one goes boom? [alarm blares] What the hell, Lannon? Your friends messing with us? That alarm means a temperature spike. There must be a core leak. If hydrogen even starts... English, Gates. Boom. Okay. How long have we got? Two hours if we're lucky. Listen, Ramirez, you got to get out now. This is real, no games here. The alarm means the core is leaking. What if the only way to change things around here  is to start over, hmm? Give Vega a fresh start? Look, I get it. Vega's a mess. I want to see it change as much as you do. Then how come you're not down here with us? 'Cause we have to find another way. The reactor blows, the angels win. Look around, Alex. We already lost. [gunshot, static crackles] Oh, can you stop the meltdown? Not from out here. I'll take you in. David's rebels want to blow up the nuclear reactor. This prison cell is in the blast radius. Just a heads-up, one woman to another. You're too good to me, Claire. When my soldiers arrested you, I had them search your apartment. They didn't find anything, so I had them search it again. I thought, "If I were a sociopathic, "duplicitous bitch, where would I hide something?" Floor lamp, hollow base. You used this radio to try to get him to defeat me. If you use it now to put him back in my hands, you just might live. So who's it gonna be? Do you care whether David comes back dead or alive? No. Just bring him to me. Ah, my favorite. Thanks, Al. Where the hell is O'Connor? If Ramirez has taken the nuclear reactor, we haven't lost this war yet. David, relax. Eat something. I'm not hungry. We need to leave. These people find comfort in my presence. I'm right where God wants me to be. They all believe... I'm their Chosen One? Yeah. They believe because I am. Stop this. You're my son. Was I your son the day you left me in the desert to die? Okay. Okay, say anything you want to say to me, but talk fast. I'm not walking out that door without you. You have somewhere better you want to be? What about this situation are you not understanding? You're supposed to be dead. If Claire finds you, you're gonna hang. And I'll be swinging next to you. We have to leave Vega. We're not going anywhere. God chose me to cleanse the world of evil, one person at a time. And I don't know a heart more troubled than yours, David. The moment I saw you, I knew God brought you to me. My work begins with you. [radio beeps] Kat, did you find David? David's in a bar behind Circus Circus. I'm watching him now. Kill him. Look at us, face-to-face, finally. Where's the Amphora? The Amphora? Really? We have so many better things to talk about, General. Tell me everything. If you unlock the Amphora, it'll wipe us all out... Angels and humans. I know. It's over there... One of two parting gifts Julian left me. The other was his army. [gasps] You could lead it for me. I'd die first. There is so much Empyrean steel in this city to destroy. What do you want, Gabriel? I want my brother! I hear reports Michael's in Vega. Fortifying Las Vegas was a stroke of genius. Defenses, Michael at your side... and after all these years, you're still here. [groans] Trying out your new strength, I see. Still, becoming a dyad was a risky move, don't you think? What do you mean? In a dyad, one spirit is always dominant... The human or the angel. Julian was a dyad for a long time. Inside him, Lyrae easily controlled his weaker half. Where do you think you'll find the strength to stay human? Take the general and his woman outside the city and let them go. Yes, sir. You're one of us now, Edward. Becoming an angel was the ultimate surrender. What greater victory could I have hoped for? This war won't end until David's dead. Like it or not, Arika's our best chance of finding him. You have to find another way. Why? Maybe it takes a rat to find another rat. Claire, Arika poisoned me. What? Don't worry. I'm fine. I figured it out in time. Why didn't you tell me? And let Arika blackmail you? I was trying to keep you safe from her. I didn't realize that you were gonna be stopping by the prison for visiting hours. Look, if she offers you a glass of water, just say no, okay? Just be careful. Oh, wow. You're the one going into a nuclear reactor, and you're telling me to be careful? I'm sure mini Rambo and I will be just fine. What? One last kiss for luck? There's something you should know about Alex. Okay, or we could just talk about him. He's the Chosen One. [laughs] My ass, he is. You're serious. I know how crazy it sounds, but I swear it's true. I saw the markings transfer onto him from his dad myself. Look, I have never given the whole "Chosen One" thing much thought, but if the prophecy is real, I'm telling you, that kid is not him. Just go save the human race. Just remember that includes Alex. [sighs] I'll see you soon, all right? You can count on it. You know, there's still so much that I don't even know about you, you know? What's your favorite food? Can you dance? [chuckles] Just come back in one piece so I can step on your toes. I'll take care of the reactor. You stay here. Michael needs you more than me right now. Michael will figure something out. And so will you. Aah. Hey. Hey. What's wrong? I'm fine. Don't worry. Nomes... Sometimes it feels like they're being torn off again. Phantom pains. Worse. Crazy how a part of you can hurt so much even after it's gone. How's Claire? We lost the baby. Oh, I'm so sorry, Alex. I'm so sorry. Thanks, Nomes. I got to go. - [door opens, closes] [sighs] It's Empyrean steel, Michael. You saved Noma out in the wastelands. Why? I like her. Pity about her wings. And Alex? You protected him while he slept. You told Noma to take him east, to Mallory, I presume. Why? What do you want with Alex? Really, Michael? Violence in your father's house? This house isn't Father's. He stopped asking innocent people to sacrifice themselves a long time ago. These are Old Testament times again. No, you lied. You told the people that God protected them. Someone is protecting Mallory, but who? If you knew I cheated, why didn't you expunge the fire and destroy the town? Because you are a special case. Why? You broke your promise, Michael. You must die. If you don't, I will put the fire in Mallory out. And everyone here will die, including Laurel. The choice is yours. Go, go! Move, move, move! Why don't you send the whole army and let 'em shoot it out for a while? This is the part of the mission where you stop talking. Okay, boys, remember, no stray bullets. Let's get "Precious Cargo" here to the control room. "Precious Cargo"? It's your code name. The guys came up with it. Okay, for the record, I grow on people. We don't have time for that, Precious. It's okay, Alex, you can't always get the girl. Let's go. Eyes up. [slow rock music playing] ♪ ♪ William Whele was a false prophet... Gabriel's puppet. He stood in the light whilst worshipping darkness, but in the desert, he atoned. And out of his pain and suffering, I was born. What about you, David? Have you changed? I hear you've been busy... Slept with an eight-ball, split the city in half, turned a small rebellion into an all-out civil war. [chuckles] I'm glad the death of your son didn't hold you back from reaching your full potential. Claire wanted you dead. Taking you out of the city was the only way I could give you a shot at survival. It's haunted me ever since. So, whoever you are now, I-I won't leave you again. It wasn't just William you hurt. How many others have suffered at your hands? Were you haunted by them too? Why did he let us go? Oh, it's Gabriel. He's done crazier things. Now that he's got the Amphora, he'll do worse. We need to get you as far away from here as we can. Me? I want you to get down on the ground right now. Aah! [groans] They were letting us go. I can't run, Clem. Gabriel will kill you. We have to take the Amphora with us, or everyone in Vega dies. Edward, please, let's go. 20 miles south, there's an abandoned town called Turner. I drove through it on the way here. You'll be safe there till I find you. 
 
 Watch your step there, champ. Oh, yeah, I know how to use the stairs. Thank you. You ever wonder why Vega's at war? It's people like you, up in your towers, safe, protected, while the rest of us fight to survive. Uh-huh. How much time we got? Less than an hour. Keep your eyes open. Be alert! Check. [gunshot] [screams] Get down! Rebels have the control room surrounded! Tell them to stop shooting! It's a nuclear... Get down! I think I know a way we can surprise 'em. Would you let me do my job? Cover it! We need to get out of here now, or else the zirconium metal in the core will have already started to melt. You got to trust me! Okay, lead the way, smart guy. Don't worry. The Chosen One will find his way without you. If you want your debt paid, take it now. I don't follow. A game. You have nothing to bet. My life. Did you not hear a word I said? I already have your life. In Vega right now, your body is asleep. It won't wake up. I'm immortal. How long do you think it'll take my body to die... 10 years, 20, 100? I've endured far worse than this. I live still. One game, Texas Hold'em. If you win, I do as promised, sacrifice myself, right here with your Empyrean steel. But if I win, you'll release me, consider my oath fulfilled, and allow me to return to my body. Shuffle the cards. I can't help you unless you're willing to face what you've done. Everything I've done was to protect Vega, to protect you. Listen to me, William, please. My name's not William. Tell the men at the door to let us... Let us out of here. Once we're away and free of the city, we... we can talk about anything you want. Then... then I'll repent. I promise. You're a coward. You haven't changed. Do you have any idea what I've endured? One walkabout in the desert, and you... You're some kind of messiah. Is that all it takes? Well, the desert may not have... have changed me, but Vega did. I've lost everything, including you! I'm not the man I was. Are you expecting someone? What? - [people screaming] She's got a gun! [gunshots] What are you waiting for? Kill her! Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. [chuckles] You don't come back here again. You understand? The hell with that. [groaning] Now, can we go? How do I know you won't cheat? You have my word. And unlike you, Michael, I honor my commitments. Deal the cards. Might as well play faceup. [chuckles] Not a bad start. Let's see if the flop can change things. What do you want with Alex? It's not about what I want. All I want are rules and order. That's it. I don't like loose ends and broken promises. The voice Laurel heard in Mallory... it's real, but it's not Father. It's the same voice that gave you permission to play me, isn't it? Tell me who you represent. Tell me about Alex. I hear the prophecy says the Chosen One is destined to be either a great healer or a great destroyer. Alex is the last pure heart. He will heal. Hmm, he's human. There's light and darkness in all of them. None of them are pure. You, out of all the angels, should know that. Alex is different. I know he is. Good. No more questions. Pair of kings. Next card. Son of a gun. Look at that. Two aces beats two kings. What a shame you can't fold. Michael. Michael. Aah. [breathes heavily] Miller, get to the entrance now! [gunshot] All clear! [alarm blaring] What exactly are you doing? [computer beeps, alarm stops] I thought you wanted me to shut up. You know, to be honest, I didn't think that was possible. Oh, we got a problem. Can you fix it? Don't bother. I thought you said, "All clear." Who wants to die first? Move. Drop your gun, Lannon. Listen, if I'm gonna die today, there's one thing I'd like to take care of. Oh! What the... I've been wanting to do that all day. You don't expect me to believe you're on our side. I'm on whatever side he's not. You son of a bitch! Get me by the gun. Okay. All right, that's enough! Nice shot. I missed. Edward! Aah! Don't interrupt the General. I knew you'd come back for that, Edward. Let her go. Even an angel needs a key. Gabriel, please. Dyads are rare, but it's rarer still for the human spirit to win dominance over the angel. Even the human Julian wasn't strong enough,  so Lyrae was in control. But you have something he didn't. [whimpers] Your love for Clementine is what's keeping your human spirit on top. But I want you to be my soldier, Edward. And now I know how... By taking her away from you. Then there'll be nothing for your human half to live for. Edward, I love you. No! No, no, no! No! [gasping] [crying] No, no, no, no. War's over, Edward. You lost. So be my soldier. [gasping] Oh. [crying] And who are you? Duma... a soldier of Gabriel. And Judas takes another life. That's it. If she found me, others will too. We have to get the hell out of here. Or I'm... I'm leav... Hey. [whispering indistinctly] What's that? A warning. He wants me to get someplace safer. [laughs] Good. If you won't listen to me, please listen to him. Oh, I won't abandon the friends I've made here. Not that you'd understand. I had no choice. We always have a choice. That's what you taught your son. When your mother died, I cut you off. Leaving you out in the desert was the second time I abandoned you. I don't want to do it again. Please, William. Come with me. Will you come with me? Good-bye, David. [cries] Freeze! Hello, David... We're taking back the nuclear plant. It's over. I suppose congratulations are in order. Nicely done, Claire. [handcuffs clicking] Your father would be proud. Where are you going? To watch my father die from the back row. Thank our brothers and sisters for the warning. I think you broke a rib. - No, I-I feel fine. My rib, asshole. [computer beeping] I thought there was a leak, but the computer took a hit. It's not lowering the control rods into the core. If those rods don't go back into the core in ten minutes,  this city will be destroyed. Can it be fixed? Yeah, but not from here. I need to go into the containment room and lower them manually. But I need you to stay here. Watch the reactor's kinetics readings. I'll talk you through it. - [alarm blares] Nine minutes to core breach. [door opens, closes] Okay, what am I looking at? Nothing. I don't understand. I thought you... Alex, I can't survive this much radiation. What? You can't come in here before the radiation's been purged. I'm dead already. There's no point in both of us dying. Then get out of there! I'll go in there. Just talk me through it. I can do this. I barricaded it from the inside. There can only be one martyr today, Alex. Gates. Gates, look at me. Gates! Look at me, Gates! Don't do this. I'm sorry, but keeping the power on in Vega has been my job ever since the day that Riesen found me. And I don't want some cocky kid coming along and taking all the glory, especially one that doesn't know the first thing about isotopic fuel reactions. [alarm blares] Eight minutes to core breach. [breathes heavily] Look, I can save us today, but these rods won't last much longer. Vega only has a few years left. These people need a new home, Alex, and I think you can get them there. Count on it. There's only two kings left in the whole deck. What are the odds of the next card being one of them? Less than 5%. Mm-hmm, quite slim. Too bad. I'll tell you what... Quit right now, and I'll save your life... but Mallory burns. Come on, Michael. Take my offer. It's a good one... A chance to save your life. My fate lies with the Chosen One, not you. But how can you be so sure? Because I have faith. Three kings. We had a deal. This isn't over, is it? Not until you bring the Chosen One to me. [gasps] Mm. Stars. The constellation. Michael, you're okay. What stars? Where's Alex? I need to see him. Oh, no. [breathes heavily] [radio beeps] Claire, are you there? Yeah, Alex. What's going on? Claire. Gates, what's happening? Don't worry. Gates Foley never had a problem  that he couldn't fix. I just wanted to hear your voice. Gates, what's wrong? There's no easy way to say this, Claire, but... The reactor's overheating,  and I've only got a few minutes left. [alarm blares]  Four minutes to core breach. It's either I go, or we all do. No. No, come on, Gates. You're the smartest man in Vega. There has got to be another way. Think. Think. Claire, I would love nothing more right now than to see your face. You know, if I could find a way to get back to you, I... [breathes heavily] I promise you I would. I hate dancing. I don't know why. I always have. And my favorite food is broccoli. Oh, broccoli. The other kids used to make fun of me, but I like 'em. They look like little trees. You don't see many trees in Vega. [crying] I don't want you to go. - [alarm blares] Three minutes to core breach. Yeah, me neither. You know the last time I felt this tired,  we just finished building the walls around Vega. That was the best night's sleep that I've ever had. Gates... [sobs] Claire, you know that I love to be right, and I... I hope that I'm wrong about the Chosen One, because Vega needs... Vega needs a reason to keep going... Just like I needed you. [breathing heavily] Thank you. Gates? [breathing heavily] Oh! Fuel rod alignment complete. Core temperature lowering. Gates? [radio clatters] [crying] Gates wanted to hear your voice before he died. And, um...  he wanted me to give you this. [sighs] Thank you for being there with him. [sighs] Alex... Thank you for coming home. [door opens] 21 years ago when the men and women of Vega  placed the last brick on the East Wall,  we knew these walls would protect us. But they've also imprisoned us, turned us against one another. Wipe that smile off your face. You'll be next. Maybe, maybe not. [chuckles] Our real enemies lie outside these walls... Those who want to destroy our way of life... To silence our humanity. All humans die. Citizens of Vega, today I am abolishing the V system. [applause] Michael, are you okay? For now. The constellation in your markings... Show it to me again. Even if at times we feel lost... That's the newest one. When did you get it? On our way to Vega. It woke me up. What's wrong? It's the Morning Star. Morning Star? We called him the Son of Morning... My older brother, Lucifer. He's alive. Lucifer's alive?
