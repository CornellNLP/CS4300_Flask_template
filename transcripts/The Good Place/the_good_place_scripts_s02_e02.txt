 This is daily notes log for attempt number three   of my neighborhood experiment. 
 Obviously, I hope and assume this will be the final version. 
 No, I know it will be. 
 All the kinks have been worked out. 
 This is the one. 
 And after I pull this off, they're gonna hang my picture in the Bad Place Hall of Fame right next to the guy who invented bees with teeth. 
 [laughs]  You, Eleanor Shellstrop, are dead. 
 Cool. 
 I'm Chris Baker. 
 I'm your soul mate. 
 Bring it in, man. 
 Sorry, I must ask,  why are you wearing a sash that says "best person" on it? 
 Apparently, I am the number one points-getter    in the entire neighborhood. 
 Is that so? 
 I always have to have my sashes custom-made    due to my height and bosom size. 
 Also, apparently, sashes are out this season. 
 The diagonal line really draws one's eye to the chin bloat. 
 Go fork yourself, you mean giraffe. 
 Run! 
 Giraffes! 
 - Giraffes! 
 Run! 
 - [people screaming]     
 Oh! 
 Mean giraffes are destroying the neighborhood. 
 Gah! 
 Oh, boy. 
 Hey, robot slave lady? 
 Busty Alexa? 
 - Oh, Janet? 
 - Hi, there. 
 Gah, still not used to it. 
 Hey, what if I, an already amazing person    who definitely belongs here, wanted to learn    even more about how to be a good person? 
 Is one of these nerds, like, a teacher or a life coach    or an Instagram fitness model or something? 
 Eleanor, I'd like you to meet Chidi Anagonye. 
 Chidi, this is Eleanor. 
 Janet tells me you were a professor of some kind. 
 Yes, I was a professor of ethics and moral philosophy    focusing on deontology. 
 Hang on one second, Cheebee. 
 This guy's too big of a nerd. 
 Who else you got? 
 ♪ ♪ 
 - Michael, what do we do here? 
 - I don't know. 
 Apparently, the Bad Place knows that one of you    actually belongs down there with them,    and they want that person to get inside the obelisk,    or they're gonna take all of you. 
 I can't go. 
 I'm too young to die    and too old to eat off the kids' menu. 
 What a stupid age I am. 
 I'd never survive down there. 
 They should take Eleanor. 
 She's a pear shape. 
 - She'd fit right in. 
 - Oh, excuse me. 
 You wish you could have a bite of this pear. 
 I'll go. 
 I deserve to go. 
 You guys can stay. 
 - Chidi, you're not going. 
 - No, I have to go. 
 - [all clamoring] - [gasps]    Holy forking shirt. 
 You guys, don't you get it? 
 Michael is torturing us. 
 That's why our lives have been so miserable    since the moment we got here. 
 This isn't the Good Place. 
 It's the Bad Place. 
 [laughs]    Ahh, farts. 
 [pleasant music] 
 ♪ ♪ 
 Okay, attempt number   . 
 Let's focus on the positives. 
 Eleanor always hates her house. 
 Tahani always hates Eleanor. 
 Jason hates being quiet. 
 Chidi immediately gets a stomachache. 
 So there's a lot to work with here. 
 Hang on one second, Cheeto. 
 So it's gonna be a hard pass on Superdork Jones over there. 
 Anybody else you got to teach me? 
 You guys ready for our lesson? 
 We're talking David Hume today,    bundle theory of the self, baby. 
 Sounds like a real banger, but you guys gotta scram. 
 My soul mate has some sort of surprise planned for me,    and he seems very excited about it. 
 Well, you two are certainly getting along    very well these days. 
 Yeah, I'm actually kind of into Sebastian lately. 
 I mean, he's a little hokey,    but he's growing on me a little bit.

 - What? 
  No version of heaven for anyone would ever include     three hours of this. 
  We're in the Bad Place, aren't we? 
  Damn it. 
  That was a real trip for biscuits,     and now we're all wet, Daddy-O. 
  I never even got to play my stupid triangle. 
  No, no, no, no, Michael, please, please, please! 
  Please don't kill me. 
 I have so much to live for. 
  I'm sorry, Janet, got to reboot you     every time I start over. 
  Oh, I know. 
 I'm not actually upset. 
  It's just the automatic fail-safe mechanism     that kicks in every time you approach the plunger. 
  - Go ahead. 
 - Ah. 
  Michael, you monster! 
  [slo-mo whirring]      Attempt   . 
  Attempt   . 
  Attempt   . 
  Attempt    . 
  I've analyzed some recent data. 
  Eleanor always seems to realize     that they're in the Bad Place     - just at the moment that... 
 - Excuse me. 
  Sorry, the door was open, so I just came in. 
  Did you just say I'm in the Bad Place? 
  Attempt    . 
  I've closed and locked the door. 
  Uh, yep, and we're ready to go. 
  This is your soul mate Greg. 
  This is your soul mate Glenn. 
  This is your soul mate Tahani. 
  This is your soul mate Lerf. 
  This is your soul mate, a golden retriever. 
  Hang on. 
  Wait a minute. 
 You know what? 
  Holy smokes. 
  This is the Bad Place. 
  This is the Bad Place! 
  This is the Bad Place. 
  This is the Bad Place. 
  The pig's getting angry. 
  This is the Bad Place! 
  Bees, bees, bees, bees. 
  Oh! 
 Oh, this is the Bad Place. 
  [together] Shh! 
  Michael, Michael, if I'm gone,     who will take care of my birds? 
  [slo-mo whirring]     Michael, no, no, no, no, no! 
  I... 
 I'm pregnant. 
 And it's your baby. 
  I have tickets to "Hamilton" next week,     and there's a rumor that Daveed Diggs is coming back. 
  Janet, we've been through this hundreds of times. 
  I mean, can you just chill out? 
  Is that possible, Janet? 
  Can you just chill out a little? 
  Nope, it's gonna be the same every time. 
  Yeah, yeah, I know. 
  No, no, no! 
 No, Michael! 
  [slo-mo whirring]      [dramatic music] 
  Please, please, calm down. 
 Calm down. 
  All right, okay, calm down. 
 Calm down. 
  I mean, why even bother at this point? 
  I'm obviously never gonna get it right. 
  "I'm Eleanor. 
 I'm so smart. 
  I'm actually in the Bad Place."     Blah, blah, blah, blah. 
  Shawn still thinks I'm on version two. 
  I just keep lying to him, and it's really bad,     but I... 
 I mean, I have to keep trying. 
  I'm in too deep. 
  And I'm really fat right now. 
  I'm stress-eating, and I'm gaining weight in my thighs. 
  I mean, look at that. 
 [gibbering]     Ohh. 
  So sorry. 
 Who are you? 
  And where am I? 
  It doesn't matter. 
  This one doesn't even count. 
   [breezy orchestral music] 
   ♪ ♪ 
  Hang on one second, Chili. 
  This guy sucks. 
 Who else you got? 
  I can hear you. 
  Michael, you simply cannot expect Chidi     to decide whether Eleanor goes to the... 
  - [all clamoring] - Yo, yo, homies, check it. 
  There's something messed up with this place. 
  We keep fighting with each other. 
  None of the TVs get the NFL RedZone channel. 
  My soul mate doesn't even know who Blake Bortles is. 
  I know this sounds crazy,     but I think we're in the Bad Place. 
  Jason figured it out? 
  Jason? 
  This is a real low point. 
  Yeah, this one hurts. 
  Ow. 
  Okay, this might be the one. 
 We're a week in. 
  Chidi's teaching Eleanor, but she hates it. 
  Tahani still thinks that Jason's a monk. 
  Everyone's miserable. 
  I'm so happy. 
  Fingers crossed. 
   [pleasant music] 
  [sighs]     Vicky, where is everyone? 
  They're not coming, Michael. 
  You have lost control of this experiment,     so we are on strike until our demands are met. 
  I speak for the entire crew, Michael. 
 We're sick of it. 
  We can barely remember     what we're supposed to be doing anymore, plus... 
  [Australian accent] I spent weeks perfecting     this excellent Australian accent, I did. 
  [unaccented] And then I never got a chance to use it. 
  You're still upset about the size of your part? 
  Yes, I want a more important role. 
  But that's just my demand; all     of us     have something we want to do differently. 
  Some people want bigger houses. 
  Gayle wants a different backstory     where she was an MMA fighter? 
  Gunnar wants to bite and/or nibble     on humans while they sleep. 
  You do know, Vicky, that if I were to do some of these     that it would be a dead giveaway? 
  And I can help you explain that to them. 
  But some of these are doable. 
  And you're gonna do 'em. 
  So Aristotle believes your character is voluntary,     because, uh... are you ignoring me right now? 
  It's day two of our ethics lessons,     and you're already tuning out? 
  No, sorry, I just got distracted for a second. 
  The last thing I remember you saying is... nothing. 
  Can you start from the beginning? 
  Okay, I need a little break. 
  Can we take a walk or something,     maybe get some clam chowder? 
   [light quirky music] 
   ♪ ♪ 
  - Where is everyone? 
 - Who knows? 
  Maybe they finally figured out clam chowder is disgusting     'cause it's basically a savory latte with bugs in it. 
  Is someone smoking a cigar? 
  Michael really screwed this up. 
  The regular Bad Place was fine. 
  If the four-headed flying bears ain't broke, don't fix 'em. 
  What was wrong with impaling? 
 I loved impaling. 
  Hey, Todd, got a light? 
  Uh, yeah, obviously I have a light. 
  You know, you guys aren't supposed to be smoking. 
  You're supposed to keep your human suit on. 
  Those suits are really itchy for us. 
  Who even cares if they see us? 
  They're just gonna get rebooted anyway. 
  Oh, my God. 
 Oh, my God. 
 Oh, my God. 
 Oh, my God. 
  Oh, my God. 
 Oh, my God. 
  This is the Bad Place. 
  I forking knew it! 
  And clam chowder is disgusting. 
  It's just hot ocean milk with dead animal croutons. 
  Okay, but what do we do, panic, freak? 
  I usually panic, but I am happy to freak. 
  No. 
 We have to stay cool. 
  As my mom always used to say,     if a cop handcuffs you to a bike rack,     there's always something you can gnaw through. 
  Your mom always said that? 
  Think. 
 Come on, brain. 
  - Janet! 
 - Hi, there. 
  - How can I help you? 
 - Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. 
  How do we know she's not a part of it? 
  We don't, but we gotta risk it. 
  Janet, can we, like, leave the neighborhood,     get as far away as possible? 
  Is there anywhere we can go? 
  [train chugging]      So we're in the Bad Place, 
  and I know why: almond milk. 
  I knew it was bad for the environment,     but I loved the way it coated my tongue with a weird film. 
  Who else is being tortured? 
 Are we the only two? 
  I got to assume Jason is as well... 
 Jianyu. 
  You know him as Jianyu, but his real name is Jason,     and he's a dirtbag from Florida. 
  - What? 
 - Also,     Tahani is a candidate as far as I'm concerned. 
  Yesterday, she told me that she was Taylor Swift's best friend     but Taylor Swift wasn't her best friend. 
  She sucks. 
  No offense, but I can't believe     you and I ended up in the same place. 
  Hey, I'm not thrilled about it either, bud. 
  I always assumed the afterlife was full of cool people,     not talking sweater vests. 
  - You... 
 - We're here. 
  Aren't trains neat? 
  Choo-choo. 
   [light mystical music] 
   ♪ ♪ 
  [knock at door]     Hi. 
 You gotta help us. 
  I'm Eleanor. 
 This is Chidi. 
  And see, we thought we were in the Good Place,     - but as it turns out... 
 - Yeah, guys. 
 I know. 
  You've been here    times already. 
  What? 
  Did you bring the cocaine I asked for? 
  Please tell me you somehow remembered this time. 
  Mama needs her medicine. 
  - We've met before? 
 - [sobs softly]      
 - I'm Janet. 
 - I know. 
  Vicky, let's look at the big picture here. 
  Now, if you all can just stick with my plan     and we pull it off, we'll be heroes. 
  You could write your own ticket. 
  You might even land the Jared from Subway account. 
  Yeah, but I don't think you can pull it off. 
  You can't even pull off those bow ties. 
  That was very mean,     but I'm gonna move past that in the name of unit cohesion. 
  You're gonna reboot those four dum-dums one more time,     and then I'm taking over. 
  I'm going to execute my version of this neighborhood. 
  You see, I've been working on it     while all of your versions fell apart. 
  This is insubordination. 
  And if you do not do what I tell you immediately,     you are going down. 
  That's a complete report of every mistake you've made,     every screw-up, every reboot     all laid out in excruciating detail. 
  Now, I'm sure your boss would love to hear all about     how "attempt number  " is really going. 
  So actually, if you don't do what I say,     you're going down. 
  [Australian accent] Down under. 
  Is it always the three of us? 
  It's always at least Eleanor and Janet. 
  Usually Chidi's in the mix. 
 Sometimes Jason is here. 
  One time, Jason and Tahani were here. 
  But you know what? 
 No matter what the combo is,     I always ask you guys to bring me cocaine next time,     and you never do. 
  Do you have anything I can snort,     like a crushed-up aspirin     or some eye shadow or cocaine? 
  Still no. 
  There's only one question we need to answer right now,     and that is, what do we do next? 
  I mean, this place doesn't seem terrible. 
  both: Maybe we should just stay here forever. 
  You always say that. 
  And you always end up going back. 
  I mean, sometimes you go back because you feel bad     your friends don't know what you know. 
  Sometimes you go back because you walk in on me     while I'm m*st*rb*t*ng, and sometimes you go back     because I walk in on you while I'm m*st*rb*t*ng. 
  But no matter what, you always go back. 
  You formulate a plan to defeat Michael, and you head back. 
  Okay, a plan. 
 We need a plan, but... 
  both: What if we come up with a plan     we've already tried before? 
  Will you please stop that? 
  Yeah, just to help you out a little,     I've written down every plan you've ever come up with,     which obviously never worked, because you're here,     and you're back, so good luck. 
  "Physically attack Michael. 
  "Seduce Michael. 
  "Make Michael think he's the one in the Bad Place. 
  Catch that magic panda. 
 Use her powers."     Oh, I'm guessing that was Jason. 
  That guy has no idea what's going on. 
   [light music] 
  Hello? 
 Hello. 
  Where is everyone? 
 
 
 
  - Janet? 
 - Hey, there, Jason. 
  Oh, hey, homey. 
  Uh, I mean... Jason? 
  Who is Jason? 
 I am a monk. 
  You know what... 
  Can I talk to you for a second? 
  I'm in a tight spot, and I could use someone     to bounce some ideas off of, okay? 
  Oh, yeah, real quick, you're really in the Bad Place,     and you're being tortured. 
  What? 
  I know it says here that we already tried     throwing Tahani under the bus,     but maybe we should revisit that. 
  Throw her a little bit harder. 
  Maybe under a bigger bus. 
  What do you think? 
  I think this is pointless. 
  We're trapped in a warped version of     Nietzsche's eternal recurrence. 
  Oh, cool, more philosophy. 
 That'll help us. 
  Well, don't you see the problem? 
  We are experiencing karma, but we can't learn from our     mistakes, because our memories keep getting erased. 
  It's an epistemological nightmare. 
  Ugh, even your nightmares are boring. 
  You... you are so mean, Eleanor. 
  You're just like those childhood bullies     who said I would never get tenure. 
  And you are so irritating! 
  In one of these reboots, I probably strangled you     and then went to the Even Worse Place, but you know what? 
  I bet it was worth it. 
  Oh, nice. 
  Ugh! 
  Sorry, can I just vent to you for a second? 
  Chidi is so annoying. 
  I just... 
 I cannot believe that     he is the one I'm stuck here with. 
  Uh-huh, wow, crazy. 
  Oh, sorry. 
 Jeez, man, I thought you could     be human for, like, two seconds and listen to me. 
  I have, Eleanor. 
  I have listened to you talk about Chidi    times     in    different ways. 
  Let me just cut to the chase. 
  You two, you got it bad for each other. 
  No, we don't. 
 Chidi's just a friend. 
  What am I saying? 
 He's not even a friend. 
  He's just a weird teacher that I hate. 
  Dude, I do not want to watch "Cannonball Run  " right now. 
  All right, what happened in the first one, so I'm all caught up? 
   I don't know what's gonna happen to us, 
   but I need to tell you something. 
   I love you. 
   And you don't need to respond 'cause I know 
   you have trouble saying how you feel... 
   - I love you too. 
 - [scoffs]     Very funny, but that... that's obviously not real. 
  Oh, that's real, baby. 
  That's real nasty. 
  Yeah, this was, like, the sixth time you guys were here. 
  I saw you getting sexy the previous three times,     so I cut a little hole in the wall so I could tape you. 
  Call it my lookin' hole. 
   Is that a camera? 
   Mindy, you pervert! 
  How many times have Chidi and I slept together? 
    different days, but, like,    different sessions. 
  And how many times did we say... that stuff? 
  Oh, only once. 
 Oh, God, I hated it. 
  It, like, really killed the vibe for me. 
  See, after I watch the porno I made starring you,     I watch you talk about your feelings to cool down. 
  It's, like, anti-porn. 
  I've only ever said "I love you"     to two men my entire life,     Stone Cold Steve Austin     and a guy in a dark club who I mistook     for Stone Cold Steve Austin. 
  I mean, why would you show me that? 
  I don't know. 
  You guys are, like, trapped here together. 
  I feel bad. 
  You know, I'm rooting for you guys. 
  No, there is no "us guys."     We basically just met each other. 
  No, Eleanor. 
  You guys have known each other a really long time. 
  Also, it doesn't matter if I told you that or not,     because when Michael finds out he's failed again,     he'll just reboot you. 
  Chidi, Janet, we're leaving. 
  I am taking this with me. 
  [deadpan] Oh, no. 
 It's my only copy. 
 Don't. 
   How did it come to this? 
  I was just trying to do something innovative     and different that would improve the way we make     humans' lives miserable for eternity. 
  Mm, well... 
  Shut up. 
 What are my options? 
  Do I have any? 
  I mean, I can't go along with her plan. 
  It'll be a spectacular failure. 
  But I can't ignore her or she'll rat me out to Shawn. 
  I'm trapped. 
  You're saying a lot of words right now,     and I only know some of them, like "rat" and "Jason,"     but I know a little wisdom I can give you. 
  I know everything that happened in your life,     and it was all stupid, so I highly doubt that. 
  I was a member of a   -person dance crew in Jacksonville. 
  We were called Dance Dance Resolution:     We Resolve To Dance. 
  One day, Donkey Doug and I got into a fight     because I'd framed his girlfriend     for boogie board theft, so he started     a new dance crew called Hashtag DougLife     and immediately challenged us to a dance-off. 
  He said, "Meet us inside the abandoned     orange juice factory at midnight."     That night, as the clock struck   :  ,     me and my crew came together     with a determination we had never shown before     and slashed all their tires. 
  It was dope. 
  The end. 
  By Jason Mendoza. 
  You know, that inane story actually contains     a bit of good advice. 
  Thank you, Jason. 
  You got it, homey. 
  I give good advice. 
  Guess that's why I'm in the Good Place. 
   [quirky upbeat music] 
  Oh, there you guys are. 
  No, stop, no more lies. 
  Jason, get over here. 
  That's right. 
  We know his name is Jason, not Jianyu. 
  We know everything. 
  I don't understand much of it, but, yeah, I know it. 
  Your sick torture plan is not working, okay? 
  'Cause we keep figuring out your little puzzle. 
  We're winning, which means you're losing. 
  So you have two choices here, buddy:     keep failing over and over or     realize we're actually the ones with all the power here. 
  Yeah, no, uh... 
 We're on the same page. 
  - What? 
 - I want to team up with you guys. 
  What? 
 Why? 
 You do? 
 What? 
  I'm in a bit of a bind, and I could use some backup,     or as Jason put it, um, I need a new dance crew. 
  So what do you say? 
 New best friends? 
  Stop it.
