 Oh. 
 Excuse me. Sorry. 
 Oh. [Gasps] 
 What'd you do that for? 
 You deserved it, that's why! 
 You hit me in my mouth! 
 That's right. 
 I hit you right in the mouth. 
 You're a child abuser! 
 Please, I want my shirt back, my watch. 
 Oh, hi. 
 Look, guys, this is... 
 She mugged me two days ago, took my watch, took my... took my shirt.

 All right, no, no, no, no, no. 
 What's happening? 
 What's wrong with you? 
 My friends are down here. 
 And I got... Hey, what... 
 He's a child abuser. 
 Just to be clear, if I step in here, are you going to arrest me? 
 Why? Is there a reason I should? 
 You said I was just helping with inquiries. 
 I am authorized to make an arrest if I feel you're in felony violation of U.S. law. 
 Well, to my understanding, FBI agents don't have authority to make arrests on foreign soil without consent of the host nation. 
 Wow, aren't you a big smarty-smarty. 
 Step in there, I'm on sovereign territory. 
 Well, I guess you're just gonna have to roll those dice. 
 Or you could take your chances with Customs and Homeland Security. 
 Wait here. 
 Interview this guy here. 
 You remember this guy here? 
 What did you say to her? 
 I asked her if there was an office available.

 Mr. Brook was a former Olympic bronze medalist for archery. 
 Both were pronounced dead on the scene.

 Oh, sh1t. 
 There's pizza outside. 
 Lex : Is she talking to me? 
 Hey, are you talking to me? 
 Why can't she hear me? 
 Doctor : Oh, nice. Pizza Island? 
 Nurse : I think they went to that new place, Napoli something-or-other. 
 Doctor : Oh, I've heard they're very good. 
 Lex : Shouldn't you guys be concentrating on what you're doing? 
 He's regaining consciousness. 
 Lex : I have regained consciousness. 
 I can hear everything you're saying. 
 He must have a pretty strong tolerance for barbiturates.

 You ever been to, uh, Peking Kitchen? 
 I hear they're supposed to be great.

 Yes.

 But right now, I'm the f*cking cleaning lady. 
 Are you armed? 
 No. 
 All right, get up. 
 Slowly, slowly. 
 So she said yes to our invitation? 
 If she declined, you'd be dead. 
 I'm sorry, I'm just calling it like it is. 
 Did she say anything to you? 
 She wanted me to... give this-this to Aaron. 
 Holy... 
 f*ck. 
 Do you understand what you did up there? 
 She said she could get my friends home. 
 You and I, we got to go grab lunch.

 It has been brought to my attention that not everyone who works here is trustworthy.

 Tull : There are witnesses to you leaving the embassy with her. 
 You have security footage? 
 You don't, right? 
 So once again, it's just someone's word. 
 Someone pointing the finger at me. 
 Okay, I'm interpreting this as a lack of cooperation. 
 My lack of Coop... 
 My lack of cooperation is because you haven't afforded me legal representation. 
 Holy crab apple. 
 You haven't been offered a lawyer because you haven't been charged. 
 Look. 
 Why don't you just tell me where these guys are? 
 Two things. One: I'm not the type of guy to give up his friends even if there was a reason. 
 Right. 
 And two, are you f*cking around? 
 Can you not see that these are both me?

 Excuse me.

 Hostess : Welcome to Pizza Island. 
 What are we doing here? 
 Grabbing a pizza. 
 Go ahead and seat yourself.

 Hi.

 You're dead. 
 Of course I'm dead. 
 Am I dead? 
 Do you think you deserve to live? 
 I don't think you're allowed to smoke in here. 
 You think you can take my life, and you can still live? 
 I didn't actually take your life. 
 Sophia : If you had been in the same position as Joel, what would you have done? Would you have shot me? 
 Honestly, I think I probably wouldn't have. 
 Even if you thought I was about to kill your friends? 
 You know, I don't know. 
 Um, I-I'd like to say yes, but I don't know if I have that in me. 
 That tells me you don't care enough to live. 
 Really? 
 Well, it tells me that I value life. 
 I value all life, not just my own. 
 So... you value your life? 
 Yes. 
 Right? 
 I suppose, if anything... 
 I probably haven't valued it enough. 
 Or... I haven't... respected its value. 
 Uh... oh. 
 I forgot they were both there. 
 I couldn't remember if he had a goatee or not, so I asked them to draw two, one with and one without.

 Thank you, Abby. 
 It's definitely him, though. 
 What did you do with her? 
 Leave her in a ditch? 
 Did you all just have your way with...? 
 Thank you, Abby. 
 So we're clear that you've been positively identified. 
 I'm clear that I'm being singled out, yeah. 
 Oh, you're the victim. 
 Gus : That's not what I'm saying. 
 Oh, there I was thinking that the missing girl was the victim. 
 Are you implying that we somehow harmed this young lady? 
 No, I'm not saying you did anything to her, but I do believe you know her whereabouts. 
 And I don't buy for a minute that you're protecting your friends. 
 I think you're protecting yourself. 
 Man. 
 Only if you knew how wrong you are. 
 Know what's crazy? 
 My entire adult life, I've been taking this kind of sh1t for what other people have done. 
 Why are you even investigating me? 
 For the last week, I have literally been running for my life. 
 I've been threatened, I've been chased. 
 I've been attacked, I've been blown up! 
 And somehow I end up being the one investigated. 
 Serious crimes have gone down here. 
 Crimes against me! 
 And now you want me to cooperate with you. 
 While I'm sitting here looking at you, knowing that you're looking at me as if I'm the f*cking criminal. 
 [Gus sighs] 
 That girl's parents call the embassy every hour. 
 Every hour of every day. 
 Now, don't you think a parent has a basic right to know where their child is? 
 I was on annual leave in the Caribbean when I got the call to mop up. 
 Sorry I screwed up your vacation. 
 "Vacation." Yeah, right. 
 I was under the impression this whole thing was a bust. 
 I mean, giving her a jacket? 
 Seriously? 
 Who killed Aaron? 
 Paris : It's too early to say. 
 The point of us setting up front businesses is for our ops to hide in plain sight. 
 The moment you become. 
 Central America's second biggest Tilapia exporter, you're not exactly under the radar. 
 The f*cking egomaniac. 
 So you think he was whacked by a rival fish farmer. 
 Hostess : Welcome to Pizza Island. 
 Paris : Yeah, something like... 
 Something like that. 
 Is that them? 
 It is them, right? 
 All right, so here's what I need you to do. 
 I want you to go over there and positively I.D. them as the drug dealers from the boat. 
 What's gonna happen to them if I do? 
 What do you think is gonna happen? 
 You're asking me to be complicit in ending their lives. 
 Says the man who shot a cop. 
 I had no f*cking choice. 
 She would have killed all of us. 
 You made a pact up there. 
 Now, for this to work, she has to be the only game in town. 
 That was her counteroffer. 
 And you have to kill them? 
 With your plausible accountability. 
 Now, go over there. 
 Be 100% sure that it's them, because right now we are firmly in the "no more f*cking mistakes" zone. 
 And if it is them, I want you to put both hands on the table and strike up a conversation. 
 If I do this, will you guarantee my friends get home? 
 I can't guarantee you anything. 
 But what I can guarantee is that if you don't deliver on your promise to our friend in the mountain, things go very, very bad. 
 You mind if we move this along?

 Seems that way. 
 We come to this world alone, and we go out of the world alone. 
 You cannot expect someone to be there for you whenever you want. 
 Life is not like that. 
 Who was there for me when I died? 
 The secret to life is to become comfortable with yourself. 
 Do you think you have ever been comfortable with yourself? 
 Probably not. 
 I think... if I may say... 
 Please. 
 Maybe you looked down on yourself. 
 You have a little low self-esteem. 
 Maybe. 
 And also you can be quite judgmental about your friends. 
 I don't mean to be, but they have this habit of always letting me down. 
 I mean, where are they now?

 Uh, yes, we are. 
 Yeah. 
 [bird singing, indistinct conversations] 
 Okay. 
 I realize now that my only option is total honesty. 
 And I know you're asking yourselves, you know, why didn't I come forward with this information when I was first brought in? 
 Um, well, that might have been because of my mistaken arrest on the heels of a very violent attack. 
 I also understand that what I'm about to say is not gonna sit comfortably, but I think we all have to acknowledge the fact... that Captain Moreno... was a dirty cop. 
 Crooked. 
 Right? 
 She was corrupt. 
 Captain Moreno was a good woman. 
 Okay. But, uh... she did work for...

 What you should have said was, "What you did, that took some v*g1n*, I'll say that." 
 Can we just make a stop before we get to the airport? 
 Are you serious? You fu... 
 ♪ 
 Please don't freak out. 
 [scoffs] Who's freaking out? 
 I don't want your apologies. 
 Who's apologizing? 
 Frankly, I don't have another apology left in me. 
 [scoffs] So what do you want? 
 Um, I'm traveling tonight and, uh, wanted to get a tin of those hard candies. 
 You guys sell those, right? 
 You came to make jokes? 
 No. Look... 
 Look, I-I know your family's pretty upset about what happened to the dog. 
 Only Aunt Shiraine. 
 The rest of us were really not that fond of... 
 Not that we would have wished. 
 No, of course. 
 I've seen some terrible things since I've been here. 
 I've seen some beautiful and amazing things, too. 
 C-Certainly things that I'm never gonna forget, but I got to get back to Chicago. 
 Erica : To your children? 
 Yeah. 
 To whom I will always be an embarrassment and a disappointment. 
 Despite what I'd like to believe, that is the truth. 
 Well, you're their father. 
 It's your job. 
 Can you explain to me how a shitty guy gets such a beautiful job? 
 [chuckles] You may be a bullshitter, but you're not a shitty guy. 
 That's why I came to help you. 
 Yeah. 
 So if a bullshitter sent you a ticket, you think you'd want to come visit Chicago? 
 You send the ticket, and I'll let you know. 
 Thank you. 
 Lex : Maybe they lost their phones, or they're not charged... 
 Gus : Then they won't get my messages. 
 We should stay. 
 With you in this condition? 
 Man, we got to get you home, ASAP. 
 Cobi! 
 Dude... man. 
 You got my message! 
 Yeah. Yeah. 
 Damn. 
 Cobi : Hey, Lex. 
 How you doing? You okay? 
 Yeah. 
 Well, that's a relief, huh? 
 Where's Joel? 
 I... I assumed he was gonna be with you guys. 
 Gus : Well, we just gotta give him a little bit of time. He'll be here. 
 Hey, where... where'd you go when you left the hospital? 
 I, uh... just went out. 
 Get some air. 
 For ten hours, you went to get some air? 
 Gus : First-class ticket. 
 Yeah, I... used my miles to get an upgrade. 
 You got my message? 
 Yeah. 
 My message? 
 Yeah. 
 Well, what-what did it say? 
 "Meet us at the airport." 
 Gus : What else? 
 "See you there." 
 Who got these for us, Cobi? 
 I... I don't... 
 What's going on, Cobi? 
 What's going on? 
 No, no, no. 
 Just because we, you know, traveled here together and have been through a bunch of sh1t doesn't mean that we're attached at the hip. 
 I'm a grown-up. I got to run everything past you guys, now? 
 f*ck. 
 [Lex groans] 
 Joel. It's Gus, man. 
 We are all together at the airport. 
 We're boarding soon. We're just waiting on you, man. 
 Text me. Let me know you're in the damn airport. 
 Please. 
 Woman [over P.A.] : All first-class passengers on Flight 232 to Chicago's O'Hare, we're about to start our boarding process. 
 We are now inviting anyone with disabilities, who might need extra time boarding, to board now. 
 Hi. 
 Because of your friend's health condition, we bumped you up to first class. 
 Here you go. Follow me. 
 Boarding officer : You need to board now, sir. 
 Sorry. 
 [indistinct chatter] 
 What if Joel doesn't make it? 
 We have to get home. Okay? 
 You've got to get home. 
 What, so we're just gonna leave him behind? 
 We can't stay. 
 We can't leave him. 
 But you have to get home to your dad, right? 
 Okay, but we're gonna keep trying to find him, right? 
 We'll come back if we have to. 
 We will do whatever it takes to get him home safely. 
 Just sit down. 
 Woman [over P.A.] : At this time, will ground staff please leave the aircraft as we are about to close the cabin doors? 
 Also, please make sure your seat backs and tray tables are in their full upright and locked positions.

 There he is. 
 It's not complicated, what we do. 
 I get product from Jesús and sell it on. 
 My old muckers at the CIA watch my back, and in return I keep them in the loop. 
 We've been doing it for years and years. 
 You buy and sell properties and I clean my money through your company. 
 That's all Milo did? 
 That's all Milo did. 
 Silly fucker. 
 Didn't realize what a great life he had. 
 Oh. Got a present for you. 
 Your mate's DNA. 
 So, let's have a look at these houses, shall we? 
 This is the sort of level I think we should go in on. 
 I've got some more here. 
 Nothing too spectacular. 
 Mid-range. 
 Of course, the, uh, beachfront properties are...
