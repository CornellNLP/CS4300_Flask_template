 The Comeback - Season 1- Episode 11 "Valerie Stands Out On The Red Carpet" 
 Mark? Mark, you're snoring ! 
 Well, I'm sorry. 
 What time is it? 
 It's 5:15. 
 Hello... 
 Who is it? who is this? 
 Billy? Billy who? 
 Val, it's your publicist. 
 Oh, Christ. I thought something happened to Franchesca. 
 Sorry. Billy, what are you calling for? 
 What? 
 We were nominated? 
 What? What?! 
 Mark, "Room & Bored" was nominated for a People's Choice award. 
 At 5:15? 
 Yeah, that's when they broadcast it to New York, of course. 
 What? Oh, no no. He saw it online, so... 
 Why is he online at 5:00? 
 He's a publicist, Mark. That's where he's supposed to be. 
 Oh ! Okay, where's the remote? Where's the remote? 
 No, I'm asleep ! 
 This is bigger than sleep. 
 Where's the remote? Put on E!. 
 What channel's E!? 
 204. 
 Just want to see if they announce it like they do at the Emmys or the Golden Globes or... 
 Oh, all right. Never mind. No, it's not on. 
 Oh, this is so exciting ! 
 Val, can we go back to sleep? 
 I don't have to be up for two hours. 
 I can't, Mark. I can't sleep. 
 Look, I'm up ! I'm up ! 
 I tell you what : you go back to sleep. 
 One second, Billy. Oh, what about best actress? 
 Hello hello hello, fellow nominees ! 
 Congratulations, one and all ! 
 What? 
 What are you talking about? 
 You don't know? Do you really... You don't know? 
 Jane, they don't know. How great is this? 
 I'm going to be the one to tell them. 
 Tell us whatÂ? 
 "Room & Bored" has been nominated for a People's Choice award for favorite new TV comedy ! 
 No way, are you serious?! 
 Yeah ! 
 And Juna has been nominated for favorite female TV star. 
 Can you believe it? We're all nominated ! All of us ! 
 Oh, hold on, man ! Bring it down ! Bring it down ! 
 You guys have been in what, like two episodes? 
 Oh, interesting. Two episodes, and suddenly you're nominated. 
 That is interesting, dude. 
 Is there gonna be a red carpet? 
 That's what I want to know. 
 Of course there gonna be a red carpet. 
 So we have to watch everything we put in our mouths. 
 Let's not forget the writers ! Bravo, Gigi ! 
 Oh yeah ! 
 Bravo, Zach. 
 Good work. Thank you so much. 
 It's cause of you. 
 Very good. 
 Oh, speak of the devils. 
 Oh, Tom ! 
 What? 
 Who's your daddy? What is all this? What's going on? We got nominated, man ! Favorite new TV comedy. Oh, yeah yeah. Well... Let's not get all carried away. Oh, let's not all get carried away. Let's not get carried away. Are you Mr. Cool, huh? Come here, you. Oh, wow. It's good, it's good. Thank you. Paulie G, you too. Real good, real good. Wow. What would you do if it were a big award, f*ck me? Yeah, hit him, Shayne ! That's right, hit him. Paulie G, FYI,  People's Choice is a big award, all right? It's from the people. That's the biggest honor you could get. I should know 'cause I have one. Did you know that? No, I was going to say we shouldn't get all carried away 'cause we didn't win. What? No, they notify the winner to make sure that they're there. It's not us. But Juna won favorite female TV star ! Did she?! Yeah. Well that's great ! Okay, so we... still have to go to support Juna, right? And celebrate our own nomination, win or lose. It's still a big deal, isn't it?! Yeah, sure. Yeah, right? Right. That's right. You know how many shows never get nominated for any awards? I don't know. Four? Excuse me, where would I find a Tom Peterman and a Paulie G? Val, you didn't... Congratulations. Yeah, congratulations. You didn't have to do... For a second I thought, "all right, it happened, he shot someone." I should put it out. You all right? I love awards shows. There, I said it. I'm not one of those stars who pretends that dressing up and walking on the red carpet is just a big pain in my you-know-what. What do you say to those people who say Hollywood has too many award shows? I say, "where's the love?" What awards have you won? Well, there's the People's Choice award which is near and dear. That was the first one. We're shooting. I'm sorry, Jane. I just have to give her a... Val. Oh, baby girl. Thank you so much for the gorgeous flowers. Well, congratulations, favorite female television star ! Can you believe it? My first job. It's crazy. Well, they have good taste. First me, now you... Passing the torch. Right. Right. Well I should let you guys get back to your stuff. Thanks, Jane. Oh my god, Val. How do you even think with all these lights? Sorry. See you later, guys. See ya ! I'm looking for a Valerie Cherish. Oh, someone's getting flowers. Oh, look at that. Oh, who are those from, Mickey ! Well, I don't know. I'm not saying. Read the card. Let's see. "Congratulations from your favorite gay." Aw, Mickey. Guy ! Favorite guy ! Yeah. It says favorite, it's just bad handwriting. It says "guy." Can you see that? Can you get it? Yeah. I just didn't... You have to write more legibly, dear. Otherwise... I don't know what you mean. You're not on the stage, so it is all about the red carpet. Don't I know it. What exactly is in that? Organic lemon, maple syrup and cayenne pepper. And a special weight-loss ingredient called fear-you-won't-fit-in to-the-designer's dress. Right? At least have a bite of my salad, red. Can't do it, Mickey. Can't do it. It's called a fast because if you eat anything the weight comes back real fast ! I got a really hot designer interested in doing your dress. Who? Jay McCarroll. I'm sorry, I don't... No, I don't know... The winner of "project runway"? Yeah, I don't know. The designer reality show I was telling you about, red. Did you? Well, you tell me about so many shows it's hard for me to... A reality show winner designing for a reality show star, are you kidding me? The press is all over it. They're already calling me like crazy. Well, we have a problem. What? Because I've already contacted Mr. Nolan Miller about designing my dress. Nolan "Dynasty" Miller? Yeah. Did me for the People's Choice awards when I won. And I promised him he could do me the next time I'm nominated. No no. I mean, Nolan Miller is great, but, you know... Jay McCarroll's happening right now. Mickey, what do you think? He's very talented. I don't know, Billy. I don't know. I know what I look good in and I look good in Nolan Miller. Valerie, you're gonna be on the red carpet next to Juna. You gotta kick it up a notch. Okay. Sure, why not? Great. Yeah. All right. Let's see what he comes up. Great. I will handle Nolan Miller... Well, let's... see what the other guy's dress looks like first. Oh, there's Gigi. She hasn't got a place to sit, poor thing. Well, Mickey, I'm not gonna invite her to join us. We're in the middle of a business meeting. No, it's cool. She can have my seat. I have a meeting anyway. Gigi, come join us. So I'll send Jay your measurements? No, let's hold off for three days 'cause I want to get the weight down. Great, see you. Hi, thanks. Sit, darling. So crazy, huh? So crazy over there with the awards show business, huh? Huh? Oh, right. That macaroni and cheese looks good. Oh, go ahead. Twist my arm. You sure you don't want anything, red? Excited about the big night? I'm not allowed to go. Only the writer-producers get a ticket. Aw, it doesn't seem fair. I... I really wanted to go. It was the only thing I was looking forward to. I'm in that room with those guys who hate me all day. Well, I'm sure they don't hate you. Why would they hate you? They call me "Aunt Sassy's bitch." Well. God, I can't seem to stop eating. Have you noticed how fat I'm getting? I... I haven't kissed anybody in like, a year. And these awards were the only fun thing that I was looking forward to, and now I don't even get to go. I'm a writer on the show that's nominated. It's not fair. Well... Here. I'm sorry. Take a napkin there. Yeah, it's all right. I know the tickets are tight, okay? The only way Mickey's going is 'cause Juna's giving him her extra ticket. Even Mickey gets to go? Well, let's think of something now, okay? Let's make a call to someone. No, you know what? I already tried everything. You did. Well, not everything. Not everything, okay? I've got two tickets. You can go with me. Okay? Oh my god. Yeah, why not? Really? Well, why not? Come be my date. All right? You're a writer on the show, you deserve to be at the awards. Done. Thank you so much. Oh, my pleasure. My pleasure. See, you don't have to cry anymore. I'm sorry... I feel like an idiot. It's okay. No, it's emotion. Hello. Hey. Where's Franchesca? In the car finishing a text message. How was your day? Fine. Hello, Jane and all. So what do you want for dinner? Steak? Oh, that sounds good. Okay. Oh, you know who makes a good steak? The palm. Oh great. Oh... Mark, hope you're not too upset, but you know that sweet girl writer? She couldn't get tickets to the award show, so I gave her yours. You're not too upset, are you? Well, I was kind of looking forward to going. Really? Really? I thought you wouldn't want to go and get all dressed up. Well I've never been to an awards show. I'm sorry. We didn't know each other last time you won. Well, I'm not winning this time. Well I know, but I thought it might be cool. She's fat. No one likes her. All right. No no no, I hear you. I hear you. I hear you. My Marky-Mark. My love ball. I'm sorry. There's going to be other awards shows though, all right? And you are going to be my date for each and every one of them. All right, there's the Emmys, and the Golden Globes, and... Oh. Mark... I'd better get your dinner. Yes, let's get our dinner. Yeah. Oh, Mickey. Does Mr. Miller know me or does Mr. Miller know me? It's the one to beat, red. Oh, okay, Fredo. I think I'm going to need one more fitting just before the awards. Oh, sure. We can do that. Great, okay. Val? Oh, that's Billy with the other dress. Here it is, hot off the press. Where is she? I'll take that. I didn't think we'd make it. He said he didn't even have time to put a label on the back. It's like... oh, Val, listen ! Don't overreact, but Jay say he went a little sexier than we talked about, but he thinks you can pull it off. Oh, and he said if it all works out, he's going to fly in from Pennsylvania for the big event. How great would that be, right? The two of you guys on the red carpet together? I'll tell you right now, she's very attached to the Nolan Miller. Shut up. Shut up ! Oh, no. I don't... This isn't me. Mickey? Red, you look hot. Red hot ! I'm all hanging out though. That's what they make double-stick tape for. Okay, if you do not wear that dress, I will kill myself. That is the dress that gets the press. But is it me? Is it me, Mickey? You want a splash. That's the splash. It's just... It seems a little tight. I don't know. Fredo, what do you think? It is... It's perfect. Just right. Well, it's a little weird in the back though. See that? Oh, was in a box. We can steam and... Ay, miss Val. So skinny. Well, we are going to need a case of that double-stick tape, huh? Great ! Great great great. Now listen, here's the thing. Jay's insisting that we use his people to do your makeup. Fine. And hair. Well... I have to go home and feed the dogs. Mickey. I'm fine. You have to do what you have to do. Ay, Mr. Mickey. Valerie, that dress is amazing. You look very pretty Oh, thank you. How is my dress? Is it too tight? I feel... No. Hello? Yeah, we're pulling up right now. I don't know why I let them talk me into smoky eyes. Looks like I fell asleep in my makeup. Look at that. Let us know. Billy, how's my hair? I can't... Jane, Jane? Jane, how's my hair. Great. Speaking of great, you really clean up nice. Very sexy shoes. I'm really uncomfortable. Pulling up to security now. No no no. Drive around the block again. Juna hasn't arrived. We have to get there the exact same time as Juna. Real important to coordinate these moments. The press is going to go crazy when Juna and I get out at the same time, so... What? No, she's pulling up. No, don't drive around. This is good. This is good. We're good. Oh, all right. I'm lowering the windows for security. Security, yeah. Hello, officer. Valerie Cherish. You all have a nice evening. Thank you very much. Gigi, why don't you slide over here and give Valerie room to get out first? Oh, your dress seam ripped. What? Where? There. Oh my god. Don't know the heck we can do about that. What should I... That's really bad. Just have to hold on to it and cover it. Hold it? We gotta move. I just thought that you should know. Let's go. Gotta move. 
 
 Ladies and gentlemen... To the left hand side. Oh, no, she's a nominee. Valerie Cherish, hi. Hello. And they're all with me, so... Okay, well, there's only nominees allowed on the red carpet. You could not... Oh, no, this is my reality crew, so they have to... Don't leave home without them, you know? Okay, hold right here. I'm going to have to clear this. You have to clear it. Excuse me. Juna. I'm gonna need somebody to verify another... Hi, you guys ! Aw, baby girl ! Thank you. Aw, Mickey, looking good. Hello, Val. Oh, don't be that way. Come on, my head's on fire from the maniac yanking at it all day. Oh my god, I'm so happy to see you. I'm so freaked out. Val, can you do the red carpet with me? Yes ! Yes, absolutely ! Definitely ! We need to go. They're going to do the red carpet together. Great, but "Access Hollywood" is waiting for us right now. So... Right now? Great ! Let's just do it. Yeah, then we gotta go. Excuse me. We're with them. You guys, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Can I get somebody to come down here and verify another reality crew? You two. Guys, come on. Val ! Yeah, we'll just be one second, okay? Don't go far ! No, I won't. They're doing an interview together, so... I understand. I'm sorry. She doesn't feel secure. This will be settled very very quickly. I am here with the original Desperate Housewife, Jane Kaczmarek from "Malcolm in the middle." I am, aren't I? You are ! It's great ! So you're here as a presenter tonight. Yes, favorite new comedy. Have you seen them? Where's Jane? Actually, I haven't seen any of them. Neither have I. So, okay. I know it's here. You're flying solo tonight. Where's your wonderful husband? Bradley's home with the kids. Maybe she's over here. Oh, a night out. Oh, yeah. Most important, what we all want to know : who are you wearing? The dress is spectacular. Thank you, it's Richard Tyler. I love the touch of color. Isn't that pretty, that color in there? Oh, it's great. Right now, they're yelling at me to go back to my mom. Mom, who you got? We're out. Clear. Um, who are these cameras? Oh, this is "The Comeback". The what? "The Comeback" with Valerie Cherish. We're over there. We're going. More coverage, yes, it's fine. Jane, we lost you. We got stuck. I know, but we got to move. We got to move. Here's what's happening. Juna's starting with Billy Bush alone... None of the fans recognize me. I should have come as me. You look amazing. Listen, Juna is gonna start with Billy Bush alone,  then she's gonna bring you in. Valerie ! Put a pin in that. Valerie ! Yeah ! Yeah ! Get down... hand that down, won't you? Okay, Billy's ready. We have to go now ! Okay, thanks guys ! We got to go. Juna Millken. Got Millken? Everybody's favorite milkmaid. Look at you, you look great. I love the dress... almost wore the same one. Oh really? Great, I just saw Jay McCarroll on the red carpet. Let's get that great press picture. Sure sure, yeah. Great. Yeah, here. Jay ! Jay ! Hey, it's Billy Stanton. How are you? I wanted to introduce you to miss Valerie Cherish. Hello, my designer. What do you think? Sexy, huh? Oh my god. It's... it's backwards. What? You have the dress on backwards. I thought it was for the cleavage. No no no. It's now or never for "Access Hollywood." Never. You know what? Go and flip the dress around. Flip your head around. I have to change it. Go change ! You weren't clear about which way ! The interview's now ! Mickey, I need your help. I need your help. What, is your new hairstylist not being able to... Never mind, my dress is on backwards.

Please take your seats. The telecast will start in five minutes ! Five minutes, Mickey. I've got five minutes. Please take your seats ! Val, what took you so long? There was a long line at the ladies' room. We waited to take a picture with you. You might want to get your publicist some grief counseling. So you did all of it, Joan rivers? Nancy O'Dell? Yeah, it's all over. It's all over. I can't believe it. You know, that does look like the front of the dress. I know, I know. Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome from "Malcolm in the middle" Jane Kazcmarek. Tom? I just want you to know, even though we're not winners tonight, to me, we're all winners. We really are. No we're not. Tom, if that's the way you feel, why did you even come? Free hooch. The nominees for favorite TV comedy are... Can I get my HD back? "Slice of life." That show isn't even half as good as ours, man. "Nut house." Gigi, they might put cameras on us. You don't want to have chocolate on your... Put it away. And "Room & Bored". And the award goes to...

Oh, never... that's all right. Can you believe that? That was so weird. Did he think he was going to stay here for the rest of the show? People will do anything to be on camera. Please welcome from "the George Lopez show", George Lopez. Thank you. I'm here to present the award for favorite female television star. Okay, a word to everyone.

And Juna Millken, "Room & Bored". And the people's choice goes to... My girl Juna Millken ! Oh my gosh. Wow, thank you. I want to thank the people who voted for me, first off. Oh my gosh. Okay...

Our brilliant show creators  Tom Peterman and Paulie G, our amazing writers Zach, Milo, Arthur and Gigi,  my fellow cast members Shayne Thomas, Chris Macness, Jesse Wood... Oh, wrap it up. Okay, okay, um... Kaveen Kahan and Greg Narayan...  and especially Valerie Cherish, without her... I couldn't hear. Could you hear what she said? No, I couldn't. They cut her off. They cut her off. The music got really loud. Yeah. ...29th annual people's choice awards will be right back. Excuse me. Valerie Cherish. Hi. Hi. We're really backed up in there. The fire marshal is totally holding us to the capacity. I'm sorry. No, that's all right. I'm a nominee, Of course. So you probably wanna... You know what? Right now, I could probably sneak in you and maybe just one member of your party. Is this a party or "Sophie's choice"? We got to get a picture with Juna before she leaves. It'll only be a short wait, I promise. Thank you. Yeah, thank you. I promise. Sure. Nope nope. Congratulations. Thank you very much ! Oh, here we are. Well, hello hello hello ! Hi ! Look at this, Val, they gave us the worst table. I mean, it's right by the door. Well, now, Chris, you got in the door and that's half the battle, huh? We are the people's choice ! Here's to the choice of the people. Oh, yes. The people have chosen and the people chose crap. Here you go, buddy. Pound that. Great, more drinks. Great idea. Hey, there you are. Hi. Yeah, here we are. Oh God. Val, I'm so upset that no one heard what I said about you. Oh, what did you say? Oh I said, "especially Valerie Cherish, because without her, none of us would be funny." I just wish everyone heard that. Well, I heard. That's what's really important. Yes, that's true. Jane, did you get that? You did. Anyway, listen, we're going to go. Do you want to come? Well, just got here. Didn't really have a chance to hang out with the gang. Okay. So... Where are you going? Well, Kiefer Sutherland's having a private party. Mm, let's do that. Yeah. Okay. Okay. And for Mickey? What about Mickey? He's my date, so that's fine. What about my date? Oh my god. I think she's got a ride. Aw, that's nice. Gigi's gettin' a little somethin' somethin'. Yeah, okay. Mickey, let's go get our goody bags and go, huh? Hurry. Ooh ooh ! Got to find a phone, call Mark,  tell him I'm going to Kiefer's, huh? Okay, yeah. Oh my god ! It's the best day ever. I know and it is. It really is. Oh, look, it's the quick way out. Sorry, miss. Everyone must exit out the back. Oh, can't we just sneak out this way? There's like a million photographers out that way. Well, baby girl, a rule's a rule, so... Please, sir, please? Well, no, we don't want to get him in trouble. So... Pose for a few photographers... All you have to do is just look the other way and we'll sneak out. Please? Okay. Thank you so much. You're going to let us... Thank you so much. Break that sh1t down ! I don't want to be here all night. The glamour never ends. Ooh, careful. Watch out. Hold it ! Hold it ! That's a great shot ! Just... just look over here ! Okay. Oh, wait ! Mickey, Mickey. Yeah. Good. Thank you. Lovely. Beautiful. Beautiful. Let's go, girls. We've got work to do. Okay. Okay. Sorry. Thanks a lot. Thank you so much. Thank you. We got it. Got ourselves a picture. Oh, Mickey?

Look at all this cool makeup. Oh, yeah. You got to be careful with that though. Used a base from a goody bag once, gave me a rash for a week. Oh, sh1t. God. Yeah. So what are you going to do with this? I don't know, maybe I'll give it to my parents. Good for you. They'll have a whole room by the time you're done. You know I didn't call for the car. Did you call to get your car? No, I didn't bring my purse. Well I brought my purse, but I can't fit my cell phone in here. Shoot, well... Well, maybe Mickey knows. Do you know? What are you guys waiting for? Come on ! Ow, my feet are on f*cking fire. Go ! Come on. I saw a limo over there. That's yours. Where's mine? Go with us. You can come with us. I'll go with you.
