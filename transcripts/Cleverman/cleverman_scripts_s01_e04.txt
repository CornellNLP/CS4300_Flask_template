Let's go, skins! Max :  Come on, skins! Man :  Come on! Oi, oi, stay on him. Where you going, bruz? Where you going? Max :  Get him! Mungo :  Ooh! Max :  Defense! Man :  Yeah, get him, get him! Whoa! (shouts) Yeah! Good one! All right, boys, let's get set for two. (groans) Sorry, brother. Let's go, let's go, let's go. D up, boys. D up. Max :  Come on, Jakey! Come on! Get into them! Boy :  Watch that goal! Goal, goal! Whoa. Ho. Whoa. Yeah. (crowd booing) Yes, good one. Hey, little brother. How you doing? You all right? I'm all right. Guess we're blood brothers now. (laughs) Yeah. Mr. Slick. Keep an eye on Djukara. Jakey : Come on, skins. Come on. Who's open? Who's open? Max : Get in there! Hands up! Come on, Gub! Hey, I'm heading off. Can you walk me to the checkpoint? Boy :  Come on, Gub. Block him, block him! Max :  Boo! The killings at the old people's home has got the protesters all riled up again. I talked to Slade about getting a film crew in here. Another eight people are dead. Slaughtered. And you're talking about film crews. They use propaganda against us. We need to fight back in a way they can understand. Get them to see that the Hairies are just like them. If we can't do that, we're screwed. The last attempt at getting footage didn't exactly turn out right. Calling in the professionals. Slade? Seems genuine. It's not gonna stop the killings, though, is it? They're calling it a massacre. That's the language of war. It doesn't matter how many feel-good stories you tell about what nice folk the Hairies are. Have you spoken to Koen yet? What do you want me to do, beg? He's the ordained one. Koen has no idea. You need to talk to him. He won't listen to me. So make him. Shouldn't be up to me. I can only control what I can. Oi. Man :  Are Hairies welcome? Crowd  (chanting): Hairies out! Hairies out! Man :  Are Hairies human? Crowd : Not like us! See you. Man :  Do we want them outside the wall? Crowd : Hairies out! Man :  Are Hairies welcome? Crowd : Hairies out! Man :  Are Hairies welcome? Crowd : Hairies out! ID, please. (clamoring continues) (line ringing) Jarrod... just checking the progress of that film crew coming to the Zone. Can you call me? Man #2 :  Stop harboring the Hairies, you black b*st*rd! Man :  Do we want them in our schools? Crowd :  Hairies out! How long are you in the country for? Three months. Where you headed next? Vietnam, Thailand, maybe Cambodia if my budget stretches. Hey, Cambodia. Angkor is a must. The ancient Khmer were truly one of the great civilizations. Ruins in need of a makeover. You have no soul for travel. All right. It'll take a few minutes for the drug to take effect. After that, I'll be putting you through a series of tests. Till then, just relax. Awesome. Okay. Using the placebo or the Hairy juice? Real thing. (beeping) Jamie, just pedal as hard as you can for as long as you can. We'll be measuring your body's response. McIntyre :  Is he gonna turn Hairy? We're focusing on target heart rate levels for now. Everick :  Still steady at 65. (Everick laughs) That pace is remarkable. He's just smashed the world 1k sprint record. (alarm beeping) Whoa. Whoa, whoa. What's happening? Jarrod : He's heating up. I thought we had sorted this. I lowered the mitochondria levels. Heart rate's 200. 250. 350. (rapid beeping) (body thuds) (sighs) (flatlining tone) See that his family are looked after. (button clicks) (tone stops) (children playing) Belinda on TV :  As terror mounts in the community following the nursing home massacre, there is renewed pressure on the government's containment policies. This massacre is the first time that multiple people are suspected to have been murdered by a Hairyman in one incident, Belinda Frosche, Network 8. Slut. Waruu :  What? (door slams) Go away. I think this is a conversation you should be having with Mom. Not expecting you to understand. But I want you to know it's over. Like I said, you're talking to the wrong person. I thought our family was different. I thought you were different, better. At least that's what everyone else seems to think. I mean, Jesus, Dad. Why? And her of all people? Blaming the Hairies for all those killings like she just loves it? I reckon you'd have more to say if some guy did this to me. If you don't tell Mom, I will. (music playing in background) (music continues) (overlapping chatter) Good song, huh? I made it. You gonna do something? I'm not her keeper. (Ash scoffs) Blair :  Mate...  would you like a drink? Where is he? Out the back. You look like a whiskey man. I'll get you one. On the house. How do you take it? Neat. Yes. See, I like a man who appreciates his single malt. The punters here, they mix cola,  all sorts of rubbish. It's a travesty. What the hell are you doing? About to ask you the same thing. More people dead, and what are you doing about it? What? That soccer kid. Old people last night. Or don't you watch the news? All dead, all with their hearts ripped out. What are you on about? Hairies did all that. They're not what's doing the killing. Never got it, did you? It's just stories, Waruu,  like the Easter Bunny, like Santa Claus. I'm sorry to break it to you. More people are gonna die unless you act. Waruu, go home and be the big man. Jimmy give you the nulla nulla? You better pray you remember how to use it. Oi, brah, she's with me. What? She's with me. (scoffs) The hell she is. I said she's with me. Come on. Oi. Blair :  Hey. (music stops) (crowd groans) Blair, get him out of here. Get out of here. Out! It's not exactly magic, is it? You're a disgrace. (distant dog barking) (distant siren wailing) Stupid. (footsteps approach) Ash :  What do you guys call it? Us guys? Don't give me sh1t, Koen. Your people. The Namorrodor. And it rips the heart out of its prey? That's how the story goes. Your brother seems to think it's more than a story. Well, Waruu doesn't know sh1t. Right about the Cleverman thing, though, huh? You're the only person that can kill it. Ash. How would you do it? Come on. Hypothetically speaking. If it was real. You wouldn't just dong it on the head with this. Hey, you're not allowed. 'Cause I'm a woman. You remember that much, then. Okay, you can't just bash it on the head. There's... there's stuff. There's cultural stuff. Cultural stuff. Yeah. (laughs) Oh, boy. We're all fine, then. Hmm. 'Night. (sighs) Angel. Hey. I thought you wanted to draw a line in the sand. Ilythia offer a totally different process to what we've been through. Yeah, you have to be a supermodel to get pregnant. The marketing's appalling, but the science, it's... it's very... Go on, tell me about the science. Well, essentially they spike the ovum with a supercharged mitochondria so that it has a better chance of taking. Spike? Uh, yeah, that's the Latin term. What do they take the mitochondria from? Uh, a plant, I think. Well, it's all under patent, so they were a little vague about the details. I wasn't gonna go, but... They've got a 95% success rate, Jarrod. What? Just, I thought we decided... it's too heartbreaking. I know. I know, but... (sizzling) Look, um... I've got an appointment for Wednesday. Um, will you come? Jarrod? Jarrod. Of course I'll be there. How long till we eat? I need to make a call. Hmm? Uh, just give me five, yeah? (monitor beeping) Jarrod on phone :  The heat exchange was greatest in the adipose tissue in his back, yes? Correct. Now listen. All we need to do is separate the mitochondria from the uncoupling protein. We'd need some form of uncoupling inhibitor. I'd start with Sestrin-2. Do it. Proof it. Let's move forward. Open your mouth. How could you do this? Mouth. (buzzing) Latani, come on. I'll find them. Hey, girl, what do you think you're doing? Djukara, you got to shave. They're looking for you. Boy! Get out of here. Man :  Put some more weights on that rack. Latani : Teach me. No. Why? Is it because I'm a Hairy? Hey, you deaf? Leave it. Come on, Gub. Slow your feet down. You gotta mean the hit. Lead. Lead with the shoulder. Use your hips, okay? Jab, jab, and then counter. Max :  That's it. That's it. That's it. Jab, jab, and counter. Again. Jab, jab, counter. Keep it tight. Keep it tight. Jab, jab. That's it, that's it. 
 
 (men murmuring) (tools buzzing) Whoa. Hey there, little brother. How you doing? I'm all right. Look strong. What can I do you for? I'm looking for a weapon. Well, take your pick. Whatever you need. I need to find my father. Oh. So you want something a bit more serious. Eh? Something like that? What are you gonna do? Bust in there single-handed? It seriously won't get you anywhere. It'll be all right. I know where he is. I was there. Knowing where he is and getting there aren't the same thing. Hey. I'll be all right. What, so you're just gonna walk through the checkpoint with your nonexistent ID? Even if you did, you'd be picked up on the streets by the CA in a second looking like that. I'll wear a hoodie. And gloves. And a balaclava. I'm not shaving. Then you're an idiot. (clipper buzzing) (crowd chanting) Hairies out! No, no, no, no, no. You can't come in, mate. You gotta... you gotta back it up. You can't come in, all right? (chanting continues) Hairies out! Hairies out! Hairies out! (truck beeping) Oi. CA not letting the food trucks through. We haven't had delivery for two days now. He's trying to starve us out. Matthews. What are we gonna do? Leave it with me. Blair : Here. Are you okay? No. No. Ah, that's Koen's. He'll go nuts if he sees you. Hey, Ash, can you help me? It's private stuff. (snaps) Kora. Kora? Well, we have to call her something. That's Koen's mum. He never talks about her. Blair :  She died in a car accident. Hit and run. They never found out who did it. She died before he was even born. Emergency C-section. Holy sh1t. (smoke alarm beeping) Hey, no, no, no! Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey. Oh, yeah, false alarm. What are you doing, Ash? It wasn't Ash, bro. It was our home alone friend here. (beeping continues) (door slams) Oi, can... that's good, yep. (beeping stops) I want to see Minister Matthews. Do you have an appointment? No, I don't. The minister is away from the office at present. I'll wait till he gets back. Name? Waruu West. And what's this about, Mr. West? Oh, he knows what it's about. (keypad clicking) (line ringing) Geoff :  Matthews. Receptionist on phone :  Mr. Waruu West. What does he want? To see you. What should I tell him? You have an 11:00. The 11:00 can wait. Just make sure he's comfortable. I'll see him once I've finished up here. The minister will see you as soon as he's able. Can I get you a tea? Coffee? No, thanks. (breathes deeply) (lock beeps) Call Waruu West. (phone dials) (phone buzzing) Waruu West. Jarrod Slade. I've got a reporter coming to the Zone today as we discussed. I believe you might know her. Belinda Frosche. Great. Thanks, but I'm not sure she's right for the job. She's perfect... audiences trust her  and she's been on this story from the start. But sending a woman... Look, I have nothing against Ms. Frosche. It's a volatile place. The Zone is... How very old-fashioned of you, Mr. West. Believe me, Belinda knows how to handle herself. I'm sure she does, but it's not her world. It's not my wife's either, but I'm not worried about her working there. Oh, well, the... the clinic is different. It's your good work that keeps things safe,  keeps my wife safe. I'll get Belinda to give you a call. (Geoff exhales) Oh. I know you. I've seen your face somewhere before. Oh. Atta girl. (exhales) Get on the bed. (moaning) (distant siren wailing) (monitor beeping) (creature squeaking) How long? Two hours. Structural damage? None. Unless you count the box. Incubation time. Mouse 30 minutes. 90 for the chimp. It worked on the chimp? The chimp didn't cook? The mouse is gonna break its neck in there. And humans? Are you volunteering, sir? (keyboard clicking) (phone buzzing) Hey, stranger. So I'm heading your way. Where are you? Yeah, I'm heading off now. Meet me inside the checkpoint in 20 minutes. You gonna take me to meet your wife? Don't play games. Ugh, come on, Waruu. We're freaking adults. Well, you know we were. Look, this doesn't need to be a miserable experience. Checkpoint, 20 minutes. Tell the minister I had to cancel. After you, sir. (grunts) (door closes) (door opens, slams) (sirens wailing) (protestors chanting) I'm inside the gate. Where are you? Alinta : Are you sure this is the right place? Djukara : They're gone. They're all gone. They're dead. They're all dead. Alinta : You don't know that. I'm never gonna see my father again! (screams) (breathing heavily) We should tell my dad. He'll know what to do. Should have just left me here. At least I'd have been with my father. (protesters chanting) Hairies out! Hairies out! Yeah, whatever. Hey. I'm, uh... I'm looking for someone to take me to meet the Hairy people. Hey, man, she's on the news. You wanna be my tour guide? Got 10 bucks? She wants to see the Hairies, but we thought we should check with Waruu first. Hi. I'm Belinda Frosche. I know exactly who you are. Network 8. I've seen the reports. My husband Waruu's not here, but how can I help? Uh, I'm interested in getting the other side of the story. You know, seeing things from the perspective of the Hairy peoples, and I was... just hoping that someone could take me to where they live and introduce me. I can take you down to the Hairy precinct. Sure they'll be happy to speak to you. I'll just get my bag. Well, you've been busy. Break and enter. Conspiracy to commit murder. Conspiracy to perform a terrorist attack. Member of a terrorist organization. The Brotherhood is a peaceful movement. This peaceful symbol was drawn in a man's blood. Listen, we know you're holding these subhuman fugitives in the Zone. Hand them back to us and we'll forget you had anything to do with it. I'm not giving you these boys. Do you wanna see your family again? Those boys didn't kill that guard, but I know who did. You've got photos of me in the containment center. Have another look. I'm wearing a camera on my chest, and I have footage of that guard being murdered. The government's got plenty of mileage out of blaming the Hairy boys and stirring up hate, but I saw who did it, and it wasn't a Hairy. And the Hairy boys didn't paint this symbol either. There wasn't a mark on the wall after that guard was killed. You blokes or someone you work for did that. So go ahead and charge these boys. See how far you get. (phone buzzing) Yeah. Jarrod :  We're further along than we thought we were. We need to accelerate things. What do you want me to do? Pick up the item... now. We need it for the next stage. That's it, off the backboard. Shoot a jump shot. That's it. (Hairies whispering) Wait. He's here. Yeah? It's the big guy, Maliyan. We need to talk to him first. Do you think this would be all right? I'd say so. Okay. It's best you go on your own from here. They might not talk if I'm there. All right. All right. (hip-hop music playing in background) (chatter, laughter) (murmuring) Hey, it's this girl. What? (music stops) Uh, hi. My name's Belinda Frosche. I'm from Network 8. I know you. That's... okay. I'm just a reporter. I just wanna ask some questions and get the other side of the story. Oh, really, bitch? (grunting) (Hairies laughing) Belinda :  I can... I can help get your message out there, you know? And we don't have to... we don't have to film if that's not what you want. I can help change people's minds. Please, just... just think about what you're doing. Shh. Maliyan. What?! Come on, you don't have to do this. You skin-mob always telling us what to do! Just let her go, please. Go on, kill her. If you don't, she'll go back and tell them lies about us. Hmm? But if you do kill her, get ready. She's white. She's famous. And they'll come back after all of us. And you know it. Screw this! Uh, thank you. I'm saving us, not you. You're not worth dying for. You're scum. They shot my little sister. And your people filmed it. You didn't even try and say anything. You didn't try and stop them! You just let them film it! And then you played it on the television over and over and over again! (distant alarms blaring) Let me help you. Koen :  I'm okay. You're so full of it. You build this... wall around you. That right? You're not alone in this, Koen. You have Blair. You have me. We're with you. You just need to tell us how we can help you kill that thing. You hear yourself? You know how crazy that sounds? Not as crazy as someone who's been given some special gift, using it to pour beer. Hey. I don't think the universe stuffed up, by the way. You've always had something. (door opens, closes) (overlapping chatter) She was here. You do what you want to me. I can take it. But getting Alinta involved, that's not on. You hear me? Nerida... God, Waruu, just 'cause you want something doesn't mean you have to take it. You were so close to losing everything... me, Alinta, the respect of the people around here. You wanna sort your sh1t out. We've worked too hard and too long for you to mess it up now. No! No! Remember how we talked about what's cool and not cool? This is definitely not cool! Kora, put the gun down! Where the hell did she get a gun? Thought we needed protection. Yeah, we do, brah, from her. Aah! Nobody move, here! No! Kora! Kora! Give me the gun. Give me the gun. (smoke alarm beeping) Here, here, here. Ash. Here, here, here. Here. You've got something of mine and I've got something of yours. Give me back the girl and you can have your friend. Sounds simple. It's the way I like to keep things. No one need get hurt. And what happens to her? The girl? That's not your problem. Kora? Come down here. Kora! (footsteps approaching) It's all right, Kora. Go on. Go to the man. Go on. Now Ash. Issue there. Boss wants you, too. (Ash groaning) (gunshot) Hey. Ash?! Ash... Call an ambulance! Call an ambulance! Help us. Ash, Ash, Ash, Okay, I... (voices whispering) (gagging) Ash. Ash. (Ash coughs) Blair : Hey, hey, hey, hey. (gasps) Ash. Ash? Hey. Ash! Ash! Ash. Ash. Ash. Ash? I love you. Stay with me. Baby? Ash. We need to go, bro. No. I'm not leaving her. Blair, we need to get out... Ash. Blair, she's gone, okay? She's gone. Get out of here. Come on! Blair :  Leave me alone! Ashley! Blair : Glowing... Now, we gotta go.
