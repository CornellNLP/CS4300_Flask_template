 No hello? 
 Hi. 
 This is all just an elaborate plan to get me alone, isn't it? 
 You found me out. (wry chuckle) 
 We're redoing the floors. 
 It's her. 
 (thunder crashes) 
 You'll have to turn off cell phones and beepers. 
 They expect me on call. 
 We'll be 20 minutes at the most. 
 I can't believe we're doing this. 
 We could still turn back. 
 I love you. 
 We're redoing the floors. 
 Okay, I'll start. 
 Due to agency-wide budget cuts, the FBI has to be very selective with its Federal Witness Protection monies. 
 You have our proffer. 
 Yes. Uh, very elegantly put. 
 Unfortunately, for my purposes, I'll need more specificity. 
 Jack Arkins. is part of a joint task force with the Cook County Sheriff's Office. 
 He witnessed and was pressured to participate in illegal activities by other members of his drug task force. 
 Some of these activities crossed state lines. 
 He is willing to help the FBI bring these corrupt cops to justice... 
 And save his own ass. 
 Okay, maybe this was a mistake. 
 All right, all right. 
 I understand. 
 Internal Affairs is investigating this task force. 
 Why don't I just let them do their work? 
 Because the state's attorney wants to be reelected. 
 He's not gonna let an investigation of his pet project become an embarrassment. 
 And what about the people in this room who could benefit from such an embarrassment? 
 I'll step out. 
 No. The Arkins came to you; it's your case. 
 If you wouldn't mind, Mrs. Florrick, I think it's better to avoid any appearance of a conflict. 
 ♪ Stand up! ♪ 
 (music filtering through earbuds) 
 Hi. 
 Giada. Alicia, right? 
 Yes. Are you waiting for someone? 
 Yeah, Will. They told me I could wait down here. 
 Oh. Uh, he'll be a while. 
 Oh, that's okay. 
 You're a friend from college, right? 
 Of Will's? Yes. 
 DePaul, third year. 
 Oh, you're in law school. 
 He talks a lot about you; almost makes me jealous. 
 Don't be. 
 J.K. 
 Just kidding. 
 Nice meeting you.

 ARKIN: That's Hunter. 
 He set up the drop house for the stash. 
 That's Brad. 
 He stashes the meth. 
 And, uh, Foley, he moves the guns. 
 You have proof? 
 And where's this? 
 (chuckles) 
 Mr. Arkin, at some risk to his own life, took photos of the task force's drop house, and he will gladly share the location upon receipt of an immunity deal. 
 You said there were other corrupt cops involved, Mr. Arkin. 
 If you could study these photos from these other busts. 
 I don't know his name, but... him, him... and him. 
 Him? 
 Yeah. 
 Okay. I'll need a week to brief my superiors, and then we can work out the details. 
 Hi. 
 You're late. 
 Yep. 
 You're unhappy. 
 No. 
 I'm drinking. 
 Tony, you know this stuff you're slipping me, crime reports and evidence? 
 You ever worry about getting caught? 
 Getting caught? 
 Mm. 
 Slipping you things? 
 (chuckles) No! 
 No. Why? 
 Just part of doing business. 
 Yeah. I mean, it's... it's for a friend. 
 Some things you do for a friend. 
 I feel like you're having this conversation with yourself, and... and I'm just listening in. 
 No, I'm just... I'm just figuring you out, that's all. 
 (laughter) 
 No, the only problem was that Jackie got a pinata. 
 So we all went outside in the middle of a rainstorm. 
 And swinging bats at a pinata. 
 Okay, where was I? 
 Why haven't I heard about this? 
 Oh, and Grandma was worried about us using baseball bats. 
 So she made everyone use these little wooden spoons. 
 PETER: My wild and wacky family. 
 You're stuck with us. 
 For your first free meal, you choose Obbie's? 
 Ray. 
 Ray Ernesto, hey! 
 Honey, this is Ray Ernesto, and he works for the mayor's office. 
 My children. 
 Hi, kids. Just wanted to say that Rich is a big fan, Pete, always has been, and he'd love to show his support. 
 I'd love it, but tell me you gotta leave that dinosaur, Tolins & Brauer, come talk to my wife about her firm. 
 Oh, that's right, you're at, um... 
 Lockhart/Gardner. 
 Yeah, we just might look you over. 
 Oh, Pete, uh... 
 "Pe-Pete"? 
 (whispering) 
 (chuckling) 
 Keep eating. 
 Yeah. 
 "Pete"? 
 So what'd he say? 
 He said that, uh, Childs' days are numbered. 
 (chuckles) 
 Wow, you're big-time now. 
 I'm just the flavor of the week. 
 He'll be telling the same thing to Childs tomorrow. 
 Anything else I can get you? 
 Uh, no, we're good. Thank you. 
 So do you like it? 
 Do I like what? 
 Stuff, politics. 
 Um, I don't know. 
 I like what it can do. 
 (phone rings) 
 I'm sorry, it's work. 
 Hello. 
 No, thanks. 
 I'm sorry... 
 No dessert. 
 (sighs) 
 PETER: What's wrong? 
 It's my client. 
 (tires squealing) 
 DISPATCHER: 00, officer down at 373 Elmer Driver. 
 MAN: Hey, lady, stop! 
 00, officer down. 
 All available units reporting to... 
 Hey, Kalinda, you can't be here. 
 What happened? 
 Out. 
 Out, and I'll tell you. 
 OFFICER: Dispatch, we got an officer down. 
 Jack Arkin's down. I repeat, Jack Arkin... 
 (sirens wailing, tires screeching) 
 We raided this meth house, and the shot came out of nowhere. 
 Top of the stairs. 
 Meth dealer named Gorman. 
 We'd been following him around for six months. 
 Traded fire, we took him down. 
 Why was Jack through the door alone? 
 He wasn't through the door alone. We were there. 
 Just not fast enough, right? 
 (indistinct radio chatter, car doors closing) 
 You excuse me for a second? 
 (indistinct chatter) 
 I'm sorry, are you really blaming me for this leak? 
 Within 24 hours of our proffer, our client was dead. 
 Yes, and we're very saddened, but we can still get these corrupt cops off the street. 
 By giving you the stash location? 
 Unfortunately, he never gave the location to us. 
 Okay. 
 Let's just chalk this up as a bad first date. 
 ALICIA: I'm sorry to ask you this now, but you know our firm wants to file suit against Cook County and the City of Chicago for wrongful death? 
 Yeah, they phoned. 
 I just don't want anyone to think I'm profiting from this. 
 We worry Internal Affairs will bury this 'cause it's embarrassing to the state's attorney. 
 Give us a chance to investigate it. 
 By bringing a lawsuit? 
 Yeah. 
 So you think I should do this? 
 I think bureaucracies are often prompted to action by the threat of money. 
 KALINDA: The task force was targeting meth labs. 
 Their story is that Arkin came through the door first, and then was shot by a meth dealer, Randy Gorman. 
 Arkin ended up on his back here. 
 Then the rest of the task force returned fire, killing Gorman. 
 But there's an inconsistency. 
 Lab found Jack's blood mixed with his saliva exactly two feet from the body here. 
 DIANE: Suggesting? 
 That he fell face-first onto the landing, then someone flipped him over onto his back. 
 It was staged. 
 We'll need ballistics. I'm on it. 
 Okay, so our story is this: The task force discovered Jack was gonna testify, killed Gorman, then used Gorman's gun to kill Jack. 
 Yeah. 
 DIANE: Let's finish this off in depositions. 
 Cook County won't want this in the press. 
 You're hot on this. 
 I'm friends with a lot of cops. 
 The bad ones hurt the good ones. 
 So, this is a crusade? 
 It's a job. 
 And a job I'll do well. 
 Notice I'm here as an invited guest now that I'm a client of your firm. 
 Yes. 
 Welcome. 
 Do you mind if I'm blunt, Mrs. Florrick? 
 Always a pleasure. 
 I brought my business here. I didn't have to. 
 Do you mind if I'm blunt, Mr. Gold? 
 You brought your business here because we're a good firm. 
 And let's both agree on one thing right now... there's a statute of limitations on playing that card. 
 Fair enough. 
 This is Mimi Collins, a 24-year-old art student at Whitley. 
 Two years ago, she was raped and brutally beaten by her ex-boyfriend, a Michael Placedo. 
 Well, if this is a criminal matter, Mr. Gold, you can take it upstairs. 
 No. It's more of an allegory. 
 Placedo was sentenced to 20 years in prison by the state's attorney at the time... your husband. 
 Mimi Collins went back to college, a happy, healthy coed with nothing to fear. 
 Somehow, I feel this will end badly. 
 Mm-hmm. 
 Glenn Childs, in a general review of your husband's cases, argued that Placedo be released with time served. 
 That is Mimi Collins' body... found two weeks ago in a Chicago landfill. 
 Looks like your first ad campaign. (chuckles) 
 It would be... if it weren't for the fact that Peter has decided to wait four years to run. 
 (chuckles) Really? 
 Mm-hmm. He said that at dinner with you and the kids, he was worried about the "seductive allure of power." 
 Mr. Gold, who does the "seductive allure of power" sound like to you? 
 That's right. 
 The good pastor, Isaiah. 
 I need you to talk to him. 
 He thinks he's trying to restore your marriage. 
 Tell him you don't need that. 
 Always good to see you, Mr. Gold. 
 Peter can't win without you. 
 You know that. 
 Peter only wins with your Good Housekeeping seal of approval. 
 Voters need to see you together up on that stage holding hands. 
 Good-bye, Mr. Gold. 
 (gunshots, beeping) 
 (whirring, gunshots) 
 Mr. Gorman got off three rapid shots on the task force lead man, your client, Mr. Arkin. 
 All hit their target... center, two high, one low. 
 And this matches the crime scene? 
 No. My stairwell's two steps taller. 
 I've adjusted by lowering the C-stand. 
 Now, Mr. Arkin fell as he was firing here on the landing, while another member of the task force rushed in and fired three shots from here. 
 (gunshots) 
 You all right? 
 Yes. 
 What does it say about me that I find this exhilarating? 
 You're human. 
 And are we saying that the task force then planted a drop gun on Mr. Gorman, or, uh... or was it his? 
 It was his. 
 Well, so how did this... 
 I mean, are you saying... you're saying it happened the way the police said? 
 Yes. 
 It wasn't staged? 
 That's correct. 
 And the... and the blood and saliva stain? 
 You don't think Mr. Arkin was flipped over onto his back? 
 No. My guess is that, in the extremity of the moment, one of Mr. Arkin's partners turned him on his back to check his vitals, and they failed to report this during the investigation. 
 You seem to accord the police a great deal of honesty. 
 I do. 
 And you brought me out here to, what? 
 Your firm asked me to examine the evidence. 
 Well, we've asked you that before, and you just said no. 
 That's true. 
 It's because of my feelings for you that I've shown you this. 
 I won't bill you for the effort. 
 Your feelings for me? 
 I was approached by the state's attorney's office. 
 To argue against our lawsuit? 
 Yes. 
 I declined. 
 I think you should do what you want, Kurt. 
 I think you should testify for the state's attorney's office. 
 I wouldn't hesitate to argue against you. 
 (phone ringing) 
 Let me think about it. 
 I'll go get my purse. 
 McVEIGH: Yo... 
 (camera shutter clicking) 
 (camera shutter clicking) 
 WILL: So, here we are. 
 Dinner. 
 And I'm treating. 
 Damn right, you are. (laughs) 
 I ran into Alicia Florrick. 
 Uh-huh. Where? 
 At the office. She seems nice. 
 Yes, and a very talented lawyer. 
 I'm sure. 
 I felt like I was intruding. 
 You felt like you were intruding? 
 I don't understand that. 
 I felt like I was getting checked out by someone who had skin in the game. 
 WAITER: Senorita Cabrini. 
 Mmm. 
 (speaking Spanish) 
 (continuing in Spanish) 
 He likes you. 
 I'm so glad. 
 You want me to translate? 
 I understood every word. 
 (snickers) Oh. 
 So, do you come here a lot? 
 My dad does. 
 Your dad? Who... who's your dad? 
 If I tell you, you, uh, promise not to freak out? 
 Okay, not only do you have to tell me now, but nothing could top that introduction. 
 Ernesto Cabrini. 
 I don't know who that... wait, I do know who that is. 
 He's the fourth richest man in Europe, right? 
 Third, not that we're counting. 
 So, men freak out about that? 
 Only the ones who are uncomfortable with their own masculinity. Yeah. 
 Hmm. 
 WAITER: Si, Senior. 
 What's your most expensive bottle of wine? 
 (laughing) 
 DIANE: So, there's no pressure in this. 
 It's just a deposition. 
 They're polite and uncomplicated. 
 They're just going to want basic information. 
 No one's trying to score points. 
 TRISH: Thank you. 
 (indistinct conversation) 
 CARY: That's good. All right, good. 
 Cary, everything all right? 
 Alicia. Hi. How are you? 
 Um... I'm fine. 
 How are you? 
 I'm good, too. 
 Are you... do you have a meeting with Will? 
 No. 
 Did you talk to reception? 
 No. I'm here for you. 
 For me? 
 Yes, the deposition. 
 I'm working with Glenn Childs now. 
 Hi. 
 How much money did your husband make last year? 
 Uh... last year? 
 Uh, I don't know. 
 My guess would be $55,000. 
 And is it true that you took a vacation in Antigua last February? 
 Yes. 
 Do you remember how much it cost? 
 No. $8,545 and change. 
 That, ma'am, is over 15% of your husband's yearly salary. 
 I work, too. 
 Yeah, part-time as a nurse. 
 That's an additional 23 grand a year. 
 ALICIA: Just to save you time, Cary, we would stipulate to Mr. Arkin's involvement in the task force's corruption. 
 Yes. 
 Thank you, Mrs. Florrick. 
 I know that you would stipulate, but I'm looking to itemize. 
 Now, let's turn to your domestic dispute charges against your husband. 
 WILL: Cute of the state's attorney. 
 Shows some unexpected wit. 
 Cary's a good lawyer. 
 WILL: You think we made the wrong decision? 
 Not necessarily. 
 Let's see how well he does against us. 
 What's Cary doing here? 
 Working for the opposition. 
 (chuckles) Smart. 
 He's drawing blood, too. 
 Look, I have some thoughts about finding this secret stash. 
 Good. That could help us with a settlement. 
 Keep us informed. 
 JACKIE: Mr. Daley called. 
 Said he wanted to call Peter before, but he was too busy. 
 I knew exactly what he... 
 Would you excuse me a second? 
 Looking for a Miss... 
 Mr., uh... what was it again? Goldman? 
 Gold. 
 Mrs. Florrick, hello. 
 I thought you might be able to help me with a little problem. 
 Well, this isn't really the place. 
 Yes. Unfortunately, this is a time-sensitive matter regarding your son. 
 Peter is questioning whether to wait four years before running. 
 No, he's not. 
 I'm sorry... he is. 
 And if we don't file by the end of the week, we'll be forced to wait four years. 
 You're not lying? 
 (repressed chuckle) No. 
 Sorry... I wish I were. 
 Pastor Isaiah talked to him. 
 Who introduced him to this pastor? 
 I did, but not with that intention. 
 Mr. Gold, there is one thing you need to know about my son. 
 He is easily moved. 
 You need to prescreen the people who see him. 
 And I will talk to this man. 
 Plan on making the announcement by the end of the week. 
 Thank you. 
 Are you good, Mr. Gold? 
 Am I good? 
 Uh, I'm the best, ma'am. 
 I will need you to be. 
 (elegant music playing, guests chatting) 
 Shalom. 
 Objection. 
 Plaintiff's counsel has an ongoing relationship with the expert witness. 
 That seems more like a reason you shouldn't hire him than I shouldn't question him. 
 I'm preserving my objection for trial. 
 Mr. McVeigh, on Tuesday last, did you conduct an experiment duplicating the April 16th officer shooting? 
 I did. 
 And this experiment was conducted at your farm? 
 It was. 
 In your barn? 
 Yes. 
 And this experiment led to your conclusion that the police investigation was accurate? 
 That's correct. 
 Are you familiar with the FBI standards for ballistic investigation? 
 I am. 
 Was this investigation in your barn in accordance with those standards? 
 In most respects. 
 So, in some respects, it wasn't? 
 That would follow. 
 So that would be a yes? 
 You are correct. 
 The assailant's firearm was lowered through the use of a C-stand? 
 Yes. 
 And the FBI standards caution that a C-stand is not a steady base for a firearm? 
 I believe that's correct. 
 You believe? 
 Yes, I believe. 
 Well, then let's move on. 
 In what other ways do your home-spun investigative methods clash with FBI standards? 
 Do you need a minute, Mr. McVeigh? 
 TRISH: I'm sorry. 
 What are you looking for? 
 These cell phone photos leave a date and time. 
 There. 
 Saturday, March 13. 
 How does that help you? 
 Do you have your credit card bills?

 (dialing) 
 (phone line ringing) 
 KALINDA: Hey, so let's say I need to get into a storage locker. 
 See how much fun it is being a Fed. 
 24-hour court orders. 
 Thank you. Thanks. 
 Here we go. 
 Who you calling? 
 Lockhart/Gardner. 
 Something on your mind? 
 Let me see your phone. 
 Why? 
 I want to see who you're phoning. 
 No. 
 Why? 
 Because I don't like to be questioned. 
 Mr. Arkin said there were three other corrupt cops, so we immediately put them under surveillance. 
 This is you with a Detective Anthony Burton two hours after our proffer, one hour before Mr. Arkin was murdered. 
 And here you are... ten minutes later in his car. 
 So? 
 So, Kalinda... 
 There were only five of us in that room for that proffer, and one of us leaked. 
 Oh, so that's why these photos are so important. 
 This one of me in the car. 
 'Cause it shows me... leaking. 
 It shows you in a compromised position. 
 With a man. 
 With a corrupt cop. 
 And yet I phoned you to tell you about the stash, didn't I? 
 Which I wouldn't do if I were compromised. 
 True. 
 I guess I could just be confused. 
 Good job, Kalinda. Anything you can find to tie it to the task force would help. 
 Are you all right? 
 You sound like you've been running. 
 Okay. 
 (quiet chatter) 
 Something special? 
 Just an $8,000 bottle of wine. 
 A what? 
 An $8,000 bottle of wine. 
 So you're a kept man these days, eh? 
 I'm working on it. 
 ALICIA: You just said the opposite. 
 No, I did not, ma'am. 
 Then I don't understand. 
 Well, I can't help you with that. 
 Look, we found your stash location. 
 You saw the police investigative report. 
 You saw the crime scene photos. 
 So how did Mr. Arkin's saliva end up on the landing two feet away from his body? 
 Why don't we take a break. 
 No, I think we're fine. 
 Do you have an answer, Mr. Hunter? 
 You say you didn't touch the body. 
 So how did he end up on his back? 
 I want to confer with counsel. 
 ALICIA: If that'll help you get to the truth, sure. 
 (whispering) 
 Okay, no problem. 
 Mr. Hunter would like to adjust his testimony. 
 Adjust? 
 Let's adjust. 
 I did move Jack Arkin's body. 
 And why did you do that, sir? 
 Jack was shot and fell face forward. 
 I, then, after firing upon and killing Mr. Gorman, proceeded to turn Jack over onto his back because he was wearing a wire, trying to nail us. 
 Where is this wire? 
 We gave it to Internal Affairs. 
 This wire will be supplied to you at the end of the business day today. 
 And guess what, lady? 
 That wire that was supposed to catch us... it shows this thing went down exactly the way we said. 
 So I'll be waiting for your apology. 
 You know what I would do if I were you, Alicia? 
 I'd prepare for a season of losing. 
 (three gunshots over recorder) 
 (men shouting) 
 (three gunshots) 
 (shouting continues) 
 (recorder clicks off) 
 So they're saying this supports their version of events. 
 I hate to say it, but I think it does. 
 No, doesn't matter if it supports it. 
 What do you mean? 
 Look at the incident report. 
 Gorman was lying in wait, gun in hands. 
 And within seconds of Arkin coming through the door, Gorman was firing. 
 So it was a setup? 
 Well, the task force knew. 
 Arkin was the first one through the door. 
 They didn't need to kill Arkin. 
 They just needed Gorman to do it. 
 Okay, wrongful death is wrongful death. 
 So let's look at Gorman. 
 Did someone contact him? 
 Check phone records... any acquaintance in common with Hunter. 
 Please forgive the lateness, people. 
 We'll get started. 
 Just come right in. 
 There you go. 
 And grab a seat, make yourselves at... at home. 
 There you go. There you go. 
 Mrs. Florrick. 
 Pastor Isaiah. 
 How are you? 
 Hello. 
 What can I do for you? 
 You can leave my son alone. 
 Won't you come in? 
 You say you're a man of God, then stop making him feel this way. 
 What way is that, ma'am? 
 Like he's a bad man. 
 He is a bad man. 
 I'm a bad man. Even you, Mrs. Florrick. 
 Who do you think you are? 
 You think you know people? 
 You just use the same words with everyone. 
 Y... you just say "God" and you think you can make people feel bad about themselves. 
 Mrs. Florrick, your son approached me. 
 He asked advice from me. 
 I will continue to offer that advice. 
 And I will do everything in my power to stop you. 
 You don't know my son. 
 This is a phase. You are a phase. 
 Then we'll see. 
 No, you'll see. 
 He's running, this year. 
 He's my blood, and I don't know what your God does, but it doesn't match that. 
 (knocks quietly) 
 Dinner. 
 We're never getting out. 
 Let's do it. 
 (Alicia and Will laughing) 
 WILL: The first time we met? 
 It was a pool party, wasn't it? 
 Indoctrination... or what do they call it? 
 Orientation. (laughs) 
 Yeah, it was a midnight pool party. 
 About a hundred law students trying to impress each other. Did you swim? 
 No, I was too shy. 
 You were the one doing cannonballs. 
 God, that is so embarrassing. 
 Mm-mm. 
 It wasn't at the time. 
 So... what did you think of me? 
 Ah... no. 
 What? 
 Dangerous conversation. 
 Well, now you have to tell me. 
 Come on, I'll tell you what I thought of you. 
 (chuckles) 
 So Giada seems sweet. 
 (laughs) 
 There's a segue. 
 Yes, she is sweet. 
 And third year at DePaul. 
 Yeah, she's just getting her retainer out. 
 (chuckles) 
 So is it always gonna be this way, between us? 
 I want to say yes, but I want to know what you mean. 
 Just... talking. 
 Being casual and... 
 Blunt? 
 I like myself around you, Alicia. 
 I don't like myself around a lot of people. 
 You do. 
 It's an act. 
 It's perfected over a millennium. 
 (phone ringing) 
 (chuckles) 
 Don't answer it. 
 It's just life again. 
 Yes, and that's why I have to. 
 Hello. 
 Kalinda, what's up? 
 No, I'm just with Will. 
 No. 
 Okay, I'll... I'll meet you there. 
 Kalinda got the dealer. 
 Gorman's phone records. 
 The night of the shooting, he had two calls from a Hank Lydell. 
 Hank Lydell? Who's Hank Lydell? 
 No idea. 
 Kalinda checked, no priors. 
 I'm gonna meet her there. 
 Okay. 
 Nice dinner. 
 It was worth the wait. 
 We always have options, Alicia. 
 I'm just saying. 
 (sighs) 
 (crickets chirping, dog barking) 
 We have no idea who Hank Lydell is? 
 Mm-hmm. 
 Or why he was urgently phoning a meth dealer an hour before he killed a cop. 
 It doesn't look like an addict's house. 
 I don't think there is a look to an addict's house. 
 What were you doing with Will? 
 Having dinner. 
 Thank you for waiting. 
 Mr. Lydell is right this way. 
 That's very unlikely. 
 Hank has some good days, but his arthritis keeps him from dialing the phone. 
 And you've never heard him talk about a man named Gorman? 
 No. 
 Who else has access to the phone? 
 Here? Any of us. 
 Us? 
 Nursing care. 
 Hank has 24-hour nursing care. 
 I have the graveyard shift. 
 Is there anyway to find out who was the nurse on duty the night of the killing, April 15th? 
 That was... Trish. 
 Trish Arkin. 
 Did I say something wrong? 
 No. It's just that's the wife of the deceased. 
 So our client did it? 
 She apparently warned the meth dealer that her husband was coming to arrest him. 
 How did she even know him? 
 Apparently through the husband. 
 WILL: And the rest of the task force? 
 Innocent. 
 Well, we don't know that for sure. 
 But it does look like it was just Arkin who was stashing the weapons and the drugs. 
 He realized internal affairs was looking into him, so he thought he would make a deal and turn on his partners. 
 And Trish? 
 KALINDA: She was a battered woman; Didn't want to enter witness relocation with her husband. 
 Well, that explains the leak. 
 When we counted who was in the room, we didn't count the wife. 
 Yep. 
 And you want to hear an even greater irony? 
 Cook County wants to avoid embarrassment. 
 They just made us an offer to drop the case. 
 How much? 
 A half a million. 
 So Trish gets her husband killed, blames the police and makes a cool half mill. 
 Are we taking it? 
 Well, I don't think we can get them any higher. 
 No, I mean, are we taking anything? 
 She's guilty, and she'll get off. 
 She's our client. 
 It's our job. 
 And at what point is our job wrong? 
 When it fails our client. 
 So let's advise our client to... to accept the offer. 
 (gunshot) 
 (buzzer sounds) 
 (gunshot) 
 (buzzer sounds) 
 So I seem to be a suspect. 
 Apparently, internal affairs is looking into my connection with the Arkin shooting. 
 Yeah, I heard. 
 This stuff seems to be coming from your lawsuit. 
 That's right. 
 So why all the questions about what I do for friends? 
 What, you thought I did it? 
 Yeah. 
 Go to hell. 
 What? 
 What?! 
 Nothing. I just, um... 
 I'm sorry. 
 What is this? 
 Who really tipped off Gorman. 
 (Mic feedback) One, two. 
 Mic check, testing... 
 So, is this just an exoneration victory lap or is he going to announce? 
 Gail, you'll find out in one hour. 
 Oh, come on. 
 Mrs. Florrick going to be on stage with him? 
 (phone ringing) 
 Excuse me. 
 This is Gold. 
 (distant mic feedback squeals) 
 I don't know. 
 They're not going to leave us alone... the press. 
 (sighs) You're right. 
 You know, I was reading about these murals in Sienna. 
 And one of them showed good government. 
 People happy. 
 Buildings going up. 
 Courts making good decisions. 
 And on the opposite wall was bad government. 
 It was the same people, but they were... 
 They were unhappy, the courts were making bad decisions. 
 It occurred to me that it only works if people step up... if you make the sacrifice. 
 Look, I was just an okay state's attorney, nothing special. 
 But I want to be a great one. 
 And I can't do it without you. 
 I don't want the kids involved. 
 They won't be. 
 And I want to work. 
 I want you to work. 
 (clearing throat) 
 A little more than a year ago, I stood at this podium and apologized to the public and to my family about a personal failure. (phone ringing) 
 I made a very bad mistake. 
 I betrayed my marital vows. 
 Hello. Will? 
 Alicia, hi. 
 Where are you? 
 Peter's press conference. 
 Is everything all right? 
 Yes. I was just thinking... 
 I don't want to go through life and think something didn't happen just because I didn't make myself clear. 
 I can't hear you. 
 I said I want to make something clear. 
 Hold on. 
 PETER: All those charges were dropped. 
 That puts me back where I belong. 
 Okay, I just need to say it. 
 We've been up and down, back and forth, and I look at you, Alicia, and I think that... 
 Will... 
 No, I just need to say this. 
 No. 
 Show me the plan. 
 The what? 
 The plan. 
 I get the romance. 
 I need a plan. 
 Not everything needs a plan. 
 Everything that matters does. 
 I have two kids that mean the world to me. 
 I have the press. 
 They're just waiting for a whiff of a new scandal. 
 And I have a husband. 
 Justice is what this job should be about. 
 So if you want to cut through all that noise, then show me a plan. 
 Poetry is easy. 
 It's the parent-teacher conferences that are hard. 
 Alicia, come on. 
 I have to go now. 
 Come on. 
 I... Okay. 
 PETER: Now I realize that I cannot do this alone. 
 With your support, I hope to become the state's attorney of Cook County once again. 
 It won't be easy, but it's necessary. 
 You're going to make my life harder. 
 PETER: Change it we can, change it we must, because Chicago once again needs a change. 
 Because Chicago once again needs a new beginning. 
 I believe I am that change, and I believe that I am that new beginning. 
 Thank you for listening. 
 (cheering and applause) 
 (reporters clamoring)
