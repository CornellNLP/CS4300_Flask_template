 That work is on going... 
 (Alicia's phone rings) 
 Alicia: Hello? Will? 
 ... And will continue, but I'm confident... 
 Huge press conference. 
 Is everything all right? 
 ... That it will continue to make me a better husband... 
 Wait. I can't hear you. 
 (Will speaking indistinctly) Hold on. 
 Peter: ... A better public official. 
 I just need to say it. 
 We've been up and down, back and forth, and I... 
 Will... 
 No, I just need to say this. 
 No! 
 Show me the plan. 
 The what? 
 The plan. 
 I get the romance. 
 I need a plan. 
 Peter: But it's unnecessary, because Chicago... 
 Alicia: Poetry's easy. 
 It's the parent-teacher conferences that are hard. 
 Alicia, come on. 
 I have to go now. 
 Come on. 
 Peter: I believe I am that change, and I believe that I am that individual. 
 Peter: Thank you very much. 
 (Applause and cheering) 
 Alicia? 
 (Phone ringing) 
 Hey, thanks for doing this. 
 It'll be right here for you. 
 (Phone line ringing) 
 Alicia: I'm away from my phone at the moment, so please leave a message. 
 (Voice mail beeps) Hey, I just wanted to say... 
 Peter (On tv): You all know my wife... 
 (Reporters clamoring) 
 Look, you're right. 
 I don't have a plan. 
 It's wrong. 
 I'm your boss. You're my employee. 
 Let's just... drop this. Okay? 
 Peter: Now that hasn't been the focus of the current state's attorney's office. 
 Instead, S.A. Glenn Childs... 
 (Phone beeps, speed-dials) 
 Alicia: I'm away from my phone at the moment, so please leave a message. 
 (Voice mail beeps) 
 No. You know what? I'm not just dropping this. 
 You want to know my plan? 
 My plan is, I love you, okay? 
 I've probably loved you... ever since Georgetown. 
 So phone me. 
 I'll meet you anywhere, and we will make a plan. 
 If none of this makes sense to you, just ignore it. 
 No embarrassment, nothing. 
 We'll just go back to where things stood. 
 (Phone chimes) 
 Will: No. You know what? 
 I'm not just dropping this. 
 You want to know my plan? 
 My plan is, I love you, okay? 
 So phone me. 
 I'll meet you anywhere. 
 If none of this makes sense to you, just ignore it. 
 Peter: Cook County State's Attorney will put justice before politics, public safety before personal vendetta. 
 (Phone beeps) 
 (Peter continues speaking indistinctly in background) 
 (Reporters clamoring, cameras snapping) 
 Thank you for coming out this morning. 
 I have a short statement I'd like to read. 
 (Cameras snapping) 
 First, please let me apologize to my wife, friends, staff, and fellow coloradans for the shadow placed over them by these accusations. 
 I did nothing wrong, but I can understand how my actions over the last two years have been misinterpreted. 
 So let me say without equivocation, I have always been faithful to my wife. 
 Not only... 
 Yeah? 
 I'm headed out. 
 The police union speech? 
 Yeah. Did you have a chance to read it? 
 It's good. 
 The opening story... 
 Not funny enough? 
 Cut it. 
 Listen, this... 
 It's not us, Peter. 
 You know, I have an hour today. 
 I thought, uh... thought I'd drop by court and watch you work. 
 Oh, that's okay. 
 No, I really want to. 
 It's a status hearing. 
 Maybe another time. 
 Okay. 
 (Tv clicks on) 
 Congressman Timmerman: The charges and gossip now being bandied about in the press and through anonymous blogs... 
 Am I boring you? 
 Excuse me, Your Honor? 
 I asked if I'm boring you. 
 I saw you check your watch, and I thought I might be holding you up. 
 No, Your Honor. We have a staff meeting in an hour. 
 I was checking to make sure I was on time, and I am. 
 I'm so glad. 
 Was that a smile, Miss Long? 
 No, Your Honor. Food in my teeth. 
 Okay, so, I love when prosecutors and defense attorneys come together and find agreement, but your client's restitution should also include court costs, Mrs. Florrick, so if you don't mind, you two can revise this while I handle a pretrial motion. 
 Judge: Tommy... 
 Let me guess. He hates women? 
 No. He just checks his Google alerts daily. 
 You have more than he does. 
 So it looks like you're off the hook. 
 I'm... ? 
 Press has a new scandal. 
 Man: It's my right, Your Honor! 
 You are one day away from trial. 
 We have a jury. 
 I will not slow this process down! 
 It's my right to represent myself. 
 You are not a lawyer, sir. 
 Yeah, and I wasn't an Alaskan fisherman till I stepped on my first trawler. 
 I wasn't a hacker till I broke my first code... 
 This is not a game. 
 You are being accused of murder. 
 It's a murder the government committed. 
 The Pentagon murdered my business partner and set me up for it. 
 Why? Because we posted top secret Pentagon video on our web site! 
 Opensourcefind.com. 
 And I don't care if you don't believe me, Your Honor. 
 It's my right under the 6th and 14th amendment to fire my attorney, represent myself. 
 (Gavel banging) 
 I will not allow this court to become your personal soapbox, Mr. Salle. 
 And I won't watch this trail turned over on appeal, you understand? 
 You are getting a baby-sitter. 
 That is not open for discussion. 
 Mrs. Florrick? 
 Are you a member of the Capital Litigation Bar? 
 Uh, excuse me, Your Honor? 
 Are you a member of the Illinois Capital Litigation Bar? 
 Yes. 
 Good. 
 Congratulations. 
 I'm appointing you standby counselor to Mr. Salle. 
 Alicia: Oh, I'm sorry, but I have the Murphy/Gomes suit going to trial next week. 
 Who's the judge? 
 Judge Fullerton. 
 Good. My court takes precedence. 
 Trial starts tomorrow at 9:00. 
 No. Your Honor, I can't! You can't do this. 
 Actually, ma'am, I can. Salle: Your Honor, I just want to point out... 
 Don't you start! 
 We are going to trial on this tomorrow. 
 Anything from you, Mr. Brody? 
 The people are content. 
 Of course, they are. 
 Tommy, next case. 
 (Laughter) Diane: And his name just kept coming up. 
 Derrick Bond. Derrick Bond. 
 I go to Louisiana to sign up fishermen for a BP class action, and I find that half of them have already been signed up by a small boutique D.C. firm. 
 Imagine my frustration. 
 (Laughter) 
 So I had to look up this Derrick bond. 
 And I was surprised to find one of the most gentlemanly young lawyers that I have ever met. 
 Man: Hear, hear. 
 Woman: Yeah! 
 (Applause) 
 Anyway, I couldn't be happier about this merger. 
 Will and I could not be happier. 
 (Applause) 
 Bond: Thank you, Diane. Thank you, Will. 
 Uh, I know that there some unfamiliar faces around, so please, everyone, introduce yourselves and communicate through... we're moving towards a paperless office. 
 We bring lobbyists, you bring corporate. 
 We bring D.C., you bring Chicago. 
 With our current president's ties to your city, we mean more together than apart. 
 (Applause) Hear, hear. 
 Now, let me turn things over to bachelor number 16. 
 (Laughter) 
 I'm not going to hear the end of that, am I? 
 No. Never. 
 Will: A few updates. 
 We got a continuance on BP, so we'll need a few of you to join us on the diocese depos. 
 And the Murphy/Gomes suit got an expedited start date, so we'll need that team to kick into high gear. 
 So let's get going. Will? 
 Alicia: Will? 
 Good job. 
 Not me, you. 
 Its like invasion of the body snatchers. 
 As long as we're the ones snatching. 
 (Laughter) 
 How long do I have to wait before I get my season tickets back? 
 (Laughs) A polite week. 
 Happy days. 
 Just so you know, I'll be playing this disgruntled. 
 The excluded partner. 
 Well, maybe we can shake something else loose contractually. 
 Oh, Derrick, we were just talking about you. 
 That went well, didn't it? 
 It did. It did. A good group. Very good. 
 Will was just talking the merger. 
 He had a few concerns. 
 Nothing big. Just about office space. 
 An equitable division. 
 (Overlapping chatter, phones ringing) 
 Peter (On tv): An hour ago, I resigned as State's Attorney of Cook County. 
 Newscaster: Another year, another scandal. 
 Another woman standing by her man... 
 Assistant: Are you kidding? 
 You'd rather have your husband sleep with a prostitute?! 
 If the choice was that or fall in love with someone, yeah. 
 One's just s*x. 
 The other's... 
 Shh. 
 Man (On tv): Miss Correlli is a key member of my staff... 
 Oops. 
 Eli: What happened to your couch? 
 Why, hello, Mr. Gold. 
 It's gone. Redecorating. 
 I'm taking this very personally. 
 Oh, Mr. Gold. 
 Do you know what a tracker is? 
 Do I know what a tracker is? 
 No. 
 An unpaid political operative who tracks the opposition candidate, trying to catch him off-guard with a question or a comment in order to tape the embarrassing encounter for free viral negative campaigning. 
 Macaca? 
 Result of a tracker. 
 And I imagine this will all come around to me. 
 The events of this morning. 
 This congressional scandal. 
 You are back in the news. 
 And Childs has people tracking you. 
 You know this? 
 Well, I know what I would do, and I just flip it to know what my opponent will do. 
 Okay. 
 So, if anyone approaches you with a flip phone or an oddly shouted comment, the best thing to do is smile and move on. 
 They will try to follow you. 
 Probably a college student, often working in twos. 
 Again, smile and move on. 
 I'm trying to keep you out of this, but it's modern politics. 
 Wives are no longer off-limits. 
 Everything good here? 
 Everything's good here. 
 Anything else? 
 No. I'm good. 
 If you're good. 
 I'm good. 
 Hey, Will. 
 Eli. 
 You needed something? 
 Yes. 
 Judge Matchick made me standby counsel on a pro se case starting tomorrow. 
 You told him about the Murphy/Gomes date? 
 I did. 
 He didn't seem to care. 
 Yeah, that sounds like Matchick. 
 He's still proud of a walk-on line  he had in the Dark Knight. 
 (Chuckles) 
 Okay, I'll have Shawn take over. 
 I think I can do both. 
 No, it's okay. 
 We're not starved for personnel anymore. 
 Merger going well? 
 It is. 
 I'm glad. 
 Landry: Don't sweat the drug cases. 
 Gag 'em and bag 'em. Five to ten. On page two, you'll find a summary of outstanding continuances. We may not have enough copies, so share at the back. Let's not go continuance crazy, okay, folks? Unless you're up against Goldstein and Michaels. (All chuckling) Then all continuances are welcome. Matan, what's up with the pro se? Guy's running a unicorn defense. He killed his business partner for the money, and now he's trying to suggest it was some sort of Pentagon conspiracy. Judge Matchick saddled him with a wrangler. Alicia Florrick. Should be entertaining. Landry: Anyone on break, sit in. Anything else? Okay. Let's get the bad guys. Matan. Why would Matchick choose Florrick? Happenstance. She was there on a settlement. Take Cary as second chair. Sir, it was nothing. It's okay. It's happenstance. It's an election year. There's no such thing as happenstance. Matchick supports Peter. He's pushing his wife into a prominent position. Cary? I want you to take second chair. Matan will bring you up to speed, okay? You got it. You're up to speed. He was bleeding profusely from the neck and chest. There also appeared to have been a struggle before the shooting. I attempted cpr, but the victim died at the scene. Now, Detective, at the crime scene, you also found shell casings, isn't that correct? Objection. On what grounds? On the grounds of foundation. Mr. Salle, he was about to tell us the foundation. May I have a ruling, Your Honor? Overruled. Exception. Mr. Salle, you know that doesn't mean anything? Oh, I'm preserving your bias for the record. Oh, dear God. Mrs. Florrick? Please, Mr. Salle, let me argue for you. I'm very good at it. It's not about being good, Mrs. Florrick. In a fight between a man being paid and a man fighting for his life, who would you bet on? I'm betting on myself. (Sighs) Don't turn your back to the jury. These nine millimeter casings you found at the scene? They are consistent with a russian-made Makarov semiautomatic. A very rare handgun? That's correct. And who owned such a handgun? The defendant. And when you arrested him, did he say what had happened to his gun? He said it was missing. No more questions. Now, Detective, didn't I say it had been stolen? You did. You said agents from the government had stolen it. (Quiet chuckling) Did I say why? Matan: Objection. Actually, you know what? Forget it. Let the jury hear this. You said the government was upset because you had uploaded a leaked video to your web site. Was it this video that played on my web site, opensourcefind.com? This video is of a U.S. predator drone assassinating an unarmed man in Afghanistan. Rodriguez: Yes, I believe that's correct. And did I give you the name of someone to talk to? Someone who could point to the real killer at the Pentagon? You said to speak to one of your volunteers: A woman named Onya who'd acquired the video from a leaker. Did you speak to Onya, this volunteer? Matan: Okay, I think I'll object at this point, Your Honor. Judge: Sustained. Mr. Salle, I already told you. The government is not on trial here. You are. Well, maybe they should be. Do I think the U.S. government killed his business partner? No. But I've got nothing else to go on. Look, we're trying to be more thrifty with Kalinda's hours, so I can't have her chasing phantoms. Just do the best you can with what you've got. What's your strategy? My strategy? Well, there's this one juror. I think he agrees with Salle. Every time the judge overrules us, you can tell he wants to hear more. He thinks we're being censored. Quite a risk. Trying to win over one juror. I only need one for a deadlock. We can give her half a day. To hunt down Pentagon assassins? To find sand to throw in the prosecutor's case. Kalinda? What's up? Alicia needs help fingering the Pentagon for a murder. How long do I have? The afternoon. Sorry. What? See this month's Chicago Magazine? Sixteenth most eligible bachelor. We're fine, Kalinda. Yeah, that looked fine. Did you see the photo spread? Will in a swimsuit. He wasn't in a swimsuit. So you saw it, then? Talk to him. He doesn't want to. He told me. He wants to drop it. Yeah. In voice mail. Anything said in voice mail doesn't count. Salle doesn't know who leaked the Pentagon video. He was insulated from the leaker by a go-between activist named Onya, no last name. Her last known address. But she's paranoid, so she moves around a lot to avoid detection. Well, the good thing about amateur paranoids is, they always leave something behind. Talk to him. Life is short. Psychologist (On computer): The most honest part of the body, which you wouldn't guess, is the feet. Newscaster: The feet? You're kidding. Pyschologist (Chuckling): No. Look at Mrs. Timmerman's feet. They are pointing away from her husband, almost as if to flee. Now, let's look at Mrs. Clinton's feet. They are facing toward her husband. This is a marriage that can recover. Now let's look at Alicia Florrick's feet. One foot is toward her husband. One foot is away from her husband. It just signifies ambivalence. It's not going away. That's the problem. It's not my scandal. Thank you. It's Colorado. That's like going to the moon. Every time they show him, they show you. Every time they show his wife, they show Alicia. So change the subject. Right, to Glenn Childs' divorce. No, Eli. No. Peter, you can't keep leaving all your missiles in the silo. I'm not leaving anything. This isn't about being a good guy. We go after his family, then he's going to come after mine. He's coming after yours, either way. Then we'll wait till he does. In the meantime, change the subject to something positive. Man: So, without further ado... What am I doing here, anyway? I present to you the new... Get me in front of some woman's group, so we can remind them of the mutual respect. ... Peter Florrick. (Audience applauding and cheering) Get me a list of any organizations giving out an award this season. I don't care if it's the knitting needlers of America. I need a visual. Oh. Sorry. Uh... my friend lives here and she said I could get her key. Are you... ? The landlord. Who's your friend? Onya. Yeah. Uh... She moved out. Right. She leave a forwarding address? No. No. She's a friend of yours? Yeah. Look, the thing is, she has my extra key, and I'm locked out. I was hoping I could get in. Oh, there's nothing left in there. She cleaned it out, so... It might be shoved to the back of a drawer or something. Do you mind if I just check? Check? For your extra key? Um... It would really help. Please? Close the door when you're done. Thank you. 
 
 (Clattering outside) (Dog barking) I found it in the dumpster in the back. No SIM card. She must have taken it when she left the apartment. So, it's a dead end? For the moment. But there was somebody there just before me. I found chipped paint under the air vent screws. So somebody must have checked the vents after the apartment was cleaned. Yeah. Sorry. I should have cleaned that up. Oh, yes. Derrick said you would be dropping by. This is Derrick's in-house investigator, Blake, from D.C. I picked the lock in the apartment. Found a cell phone hidden in the air vent. It looked like the subject left in a rush. She left this in the phone. SIM card. Much of it's encrypted. I can try and decipher if you want. Diane: Uh, yeah. Let's see what you can find. I wouldn't mind Kalinda trying to decipher. She's done it for me before. Um... Yeah. Well, why don't you work on it together? Did you ever find your extra key? You knew who I was? Yeah. I wanted to see how you'd play it. What are you, man of a thousand faces? No. Just one. Does that flirtation bit always work for you? Yeah. Are we going to have trouble? No. No. As far as I'm concerned, it's your backyard, Leela. Sorry. That's not your name, is it? It's Kalinda. Kalinda's your name. Right. Imagine my surprise when I looked at the membership roll of the women's auxiliary of the botanical gardens and saw your name. I was also surprised to see that the auxiliary has not awarded a "friend of the auxiliary" in quite some time. Anyway, if you could talk to the auxiliary... Well, certainly, Mr. Gold. How's the campaign going? The campaign? It's going very well, ma'am. Thank you. Why? Oh, no reason. It's just that it seems like you're coming to me more than I might expect. And how much did you expect, Mrs. Florrick? I imagine that campaigns are very complicated things. Maybe you need... help. What kind of help? I think we should stay in touch. I think we should talk regularly. I can offer you advice and you can ask questions when you are confused. I think that's a very good idea. Let's stay in touch. (Washer buzzing) Objection! Overruled. Exception! And ye... yes, exception, I get it. Judge: Continue, Mr. Brody. What other forensic evidence did you collect from the scene, ma'am? We found partial palm prints on the cessna door and fingerprints on the inside. Matan: And who did those prints belong to? The defendant. Matan: No further questions. Have I been on that plane before? Objection, Your Honor. Beyond the scope. Judge: Sustained. These prints of mine on the plane... that doesn't mean that I was at any time... ? Matan: Objection. Judge: Sustained. (Whispers): Did your investigation reveal you were on the plane... ? Did your investigation reveal that I had been on the plane a week before the murder, and that could be the source of the fingerprints? Yes. Judge: Are we finished here, Mr. Salle? Uh, one second, Your Honor. Mr. Salle? Miss... I forgot your name. Loren. Loren, sorry. What happened to the sample #48? I don't understand the question. You collected 48 blood samples. Isn't that correct? No, 47 blood samples. Yes, 47 samples according to your evidence list, and yet here on the crime scene photo, there is a 48th sample. That's outside the designated crime scene. So, you found blood outside the designated crime scene, and you decided not to include it? Matan: Objection, Your Honor. This is a large hangar, and this blood sample was found by a tool Kit which could have been left by any random worker. Overruled. Judge: Answer the question. We did a preliminary blood type test of this blood sample, as we do with all our samples. It was O-negative, not consistent with the victim. Salle: And what is my blood type? B-positive. So it wasn't consistent with my blood type either. No further questions. I haven't said this in a while to anyone. Thank you. Blake: Cryptbit encryption? You don't like laser-mite? Try combining laser-mite and elcosec. Use them as binary sifters. They'd cancel each other out. Use laser-mite for salting. So, what did you find out about me? Some friends in D.C. said you phoned. You have enemies. (Typing) Nice... same phone number. There, there, there. Every night at 7:30. Yeah. You recognize it. Stan's chicken shack. She's ordering takeout. You think she would get takeout again from her new address? Hey, leela. (Clears throat) We should work together. Stop it. What? It's been such a difficult time for Peter and his family, and... this award will mean so much to them. Now he needs us. Would you excuse me? Her daughter-in-law... that's who we should get. Oh, hello, Jackie. Hello, Ruth. We were just talking about your daughter-in-law. Where is Alicia? Well, as you know, she works, but my granddaughter is here... Grace. Grace. She's thinking of joining our cotillion. Oh. Grace! (Sighing) It's so bogus, huh? Yeah, I got dragged here. Yeah. You, too? No, no, I'm... I'm working. Doing what? You know. (Both laugh) So has your mom or dad said anything about this other scandal? The one right now? No. They kind of just try to avoid the whole subject, you know. They're still sleeping in separate rooms? Who's that? Boy: Oh, Steven... he's in film school. So your parents aren't sleeping together anymore, right? And you used to do accounting work for the victim, Mr. Kimball? Yes, and Mr. Salle. I'm sorry, Miss Derbeken, could you please move your hand? Yes, sorry. In fact, you traveled with Mr. Kimball, didn't you? Yes, our job required moving around a lot, so I stayed in the same hotel. And you saw firsthand a dispute between Mr. Kimball and the defendant about their web site? Yes, I did. In fact, could you describe the letter you saw sent by Mr. Salle to the victim a week before the murder? Object now. Why? Do it. Objection. Your Honor, this isn't hearsay. Miss Derbeken is testifying to a letter she read herself, not what was heard. Yes, but, uh... best evidence, Your Honor. I'm listening. The original letter offers... The original letter offers the best evidence, and it can't be testified to if the letter is not produced. Where is the letter? Oh, come on. Your Honor, we can't establish motive unless we hear from her. Judge: That's not my problem, Mr. Brody. The objection is sustained. Miss Derbeken cannot testify to the letter. Know what I want to do if I get out? Go to law school. Matan: He's got no case, sir. He's still arguing a unicorn defense. And he's beating you. He's got no case, and he's beating you. Cary. Don't do this... he's a first year. I don't care if he's just out of law school. Can you beat her? Uh... we just caught a bad break, Mr. Childs. That's not what I asked. Can you beat her? Yes. You're first chair. I don't know how long you plan to stay with us, but that's not how you endear yourself to your coworkers. Oh, is that what this is about... endearment? Diane: Oh, uh, one last thing. How are you on partners' offices? Diane has a corner office. I have a partial corner with more square footage. We could splurge for either. One of the things we did at our old office was move the partners' offices into the core of the building and made the outside communal associate areas. It fostered goodwill. Do you prefer an interior office? Let me think on it. And I would like to start a partner mentor-ship program. Well, we already unofficially mentor associates. I think it'll create greater goodwill if we officially mentor. There's one more thing. Peer review. We don't choose who to fire. Associates grade each other. It creates community. Yeah, like lord of the flies. (Laughs) Um, well, let us think on that. Are we being played in some way? I don't see how. I don't either. It's making me suspicious. (Chuckles) Cashier: Stan's chicken shack on 58th. Yeah, I just phoned a minute ago for my delivery order. I just want to check I gave you the right address. The name's Onya. No delivery by that name. Are you sure you have the right... ? (Phone beeps off) (Dialing) (Line ringing) Cashier 2: Stan's chicken shack. Yeah, I think I might have given you the wrong address. Uh, the name's Onya. Oh, yeah, you got a new address? Uh, no, I... I think I may have given you the wrong address. Uh, what do you have? 9625 West Marshfield, Apartment 5-EE. Is that right? Yeah, yeah, that... that's really good. Thank you, bye. Hi. Hi. You ready to take another go at this? What is lupus? Lupus is a disease in which the immune system attacks... Objection, Your Honor. Uh, beyond the scope. Judge: Hmm, I'm going to overrule on that. I'd like to see where this is going. Lupus is a disease in which the immune system attacks the body's cells and tissue, resulting in inflammation and tissue damage. How common is it? Loren: Fairly common. It affects perhaps one out of every 1,000 Americans. Does the defendant Mr. Salle suffer from lupus? Lupus erythematosus, yes, he does. Now, what is another odd artifact of lupus? Well, if you withdraw medication, it can change your blood type. Cary: Hmm, so Mr. Salle could have O-negative blood one week, and if he changed his medication, b-positive the next? Loren: That is correct. Wow. Now... This blood sample that you took from a tool kit in the hangar... this blood sample that Mrs. Florrick and her mentor worked so diligently to get into evidence... did you expedite a DNA test looking for a match? I did. And who did it match? Loren: Mr. Salle the defendant. Cary: Well, no further questions. The prosecution rests. Kalinda: Onya. No, no, no, Vance sent me. I work with his lawyers. I'm not Onya you're looking for... Okay, they know you're in there. Don't go back in there. Come on. Look, Vance wants to help, but he needs your help, too. You know who shot Kimball, right? Was it the government? Shh. What? The feds use strollers. They're transmitters. They're easy to disguise. The guy who leaked me the video? He was afraid that Kimball was going to name him, so he killed him. Onya, you have to testify to that. No. No, he'll kill you. He'll kill me, too. We can hide your identity. No, you can't. If you bring me into that court, I will plead the fifth. Look at her. Like that's a real baby. Okay, then tell me the name of the leaker. I'll take the risk. Come on. It's the least you can do for Vance. Kalinda: Good news is we found the leaker. CIA analyst, Edgar Barkus. The bad news? He's missing. Office was cleared out a month ago. Diane: So, what are we saying? It is a government conspiracy? Or the Pentagon found their leaker. Will: Alicia? Use her. Use Onya. I don't understand. Prosecution is winning because they're arguing a straightforward case with a straightforward motive. Your client killed over money: Possession of his web site. You need a straightforward alternative. Jealousy. Who's jealous? Onya. But she'll plead the fifth. Right, so use her. Alicia: Onya, you're familiar with Mr. Kimball's accountant, Jeanine Derbeken? Onya: What do you mean, familiar? You know who she is? Yes. This should be interesting. You have to go? Yeah. Take care. Alicia: And you knew that Jeanine would often stay in Mr. Kimball's hotel room when he traveled? No. You didn't know that? But you also traveled with Mr. Kimball, didn't you? I did, yeah. And... Did you ever fight with Jeanine? Onya: With... ? No. You never fought with Jeanine over the attentions of Mr. Kimball? Cary: Objection. Sustained. So, Onya, the week before the murder... this is the week Mr. Kimball received the leaked video... did you and Mr. Kimball travel to Washington D.C.? It's a simple question, Onya. Did you and Mr. Kimball stay together in Washington, D.C.? I refuse to answer on the grounds that it may incriminate me. Judge: Are you sure that's what you want to do? You're pleading the fifth? Yes. You're worried... about relating what happened with the victim in Washington D.C.? I refuse to answer on the grounds that it may incriminate me. Miss, I want to make sure I understand what you're saying. Your Honor, the witness already answered... Are you pleading the fifth because you were involved in Mr. Kimball's murder, or because of the leaked... ? Your Honor, it is not your place to ask my witness. Yes, it is, Mrs. Florrick. Now, you are taking the fifth... Alicia: Your Honor, if you compel my witness to answer this question, I am moving for an immediate mistrial. Denied. I'm asking a simple question... You are not, sir! Mrs. Florrick... You are piercing the fifth amendment right. Mr. Florrick, shut up. No, sir. Excuse me. As long as you are attempting to circumvent her fifth amendment right, I will not shut up. You will shut up, or be held in contempt. Then hold me in contempt, and I will refer this to the judicial conduct committee for immediate action. This court will adjourn until tomorrow morning. (Gavel bangs) (Water running) I'm almost done. What are you up to? Peter. I saw you in court today. Yeah? You were amazing. Peter, I've got to... study. Peter, I have to study. (Radio news program playing quietly) Okay. Let me. (Gasps) (Alicia sighs contentedly) So, let's just go at this from a different angle. Do you know of any motive Mr. Salle might have had to murder Mr. Kimball? I refuse to answer on the grounds that it might incriminate me. Now, are you pleading the fifth because you were involved in the murder, or... I refuse to answer on the grounds that it might incriminate me. So, you want to follow me again? Have me do your work for you? Blake: Nope, I have something for you. I picked it up on my police scanner. A kid found the murder weapon down by the river. A Russian-made Makarov semi-automatic. The cops have it? They're checking it for prints right now. My guess is, your client didn't wipe it down. How long do we have? I know your Chicago cops are slow, but I'd say you got few minutes. And you still want to plead the fifth? Onya: I refuse to answer... Cary: No more questions. Judge: Mrs. Florrick? Your next witness. Defense rests, Your Honor. What are you doing? We still have to refute the blood evidence. Defense rests. Your Honor, the people are unprepared for closing arguments. That's unfortunate, Mr. Agos, because I am. Well, we request a five-minute recess. No, Mr. Agos. This trial has gone on much longer than I anticipated, and I'm tired. So you go now, or you don't go. (Sighs) And where does that leave the defense? Cary: In tatters. Look at their witnesses. Oops. I'm sorry. Their one witness. Your Honor, I need to interrupt. The police have just uncovered a new piece of evidence. Mr. Brody, you know as well as I that once the prosecution starts its closing arguments, there is no new evidence. Yes, Your Honor, but these are extraordinary circumstances. Well, that's unfortunate, Mr. Brody. If the jury deadlocks, you may use your extraordinary circumstances in the next trial. The jury will ignore Mr. Brody's statements. You may continue, Mr. Agos. (Footfalls) Hey. About your peer review suggestion. We thought we could try it for one year as a pilot program. Okay. Oh, and we're still working on getting you a smaller office without a window. But in the meantime, you'll have to live with this. Thank you. You shoot the hoops? I do. We got an afternoon league. A few judges, lawyers. We could use some Baltimore blood. Oh, you can't handle some Baltimore blood. (Laughs) (Chuckles) That's how it starts. Still deliberating? Yep. You know, that gun they found? The feds have a way of making this stuff pop up right when they need it. They're offering you five years. They're... who is? The state's attorney's office. Five years, second degree. But you're... I mean, we're not considering it. Yes, we are. It just takes one. Yeah, it just takes one to deadlock. Yes. And if the jury deadlocks, the gun is in. A deadlock works against you. I can say the government planted... Oh, Vance, stop it. You did it. Right now, you're in control. Once the jury comes in, it's out of your hands. Take the five years. Did he take it? The five years? Yes. It was the smart move. I'm your new mentor. See you tomorrow morning.
