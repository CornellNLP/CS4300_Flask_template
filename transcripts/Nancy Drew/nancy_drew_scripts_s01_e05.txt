 Previously on "Nancy Drew" CARSON: Tiffany died of natural causes. 
  That autopsy is a lie. 
  NICK: If I cash the bonds Tiffany gave me, I look suspicious, but the more they sit here, the more they feel like a ticking bomb. 
  NANCY: Laura Tandy, Tiffany's sister. 
  She now holds the distinct honor - of being the last living Tandy. 
  - I'm Elizabeth, by the way. 
  So, Elizabeth, where did you, uh, learn how to do this? 
  I was the other woman. 
  I mean, what I did to Tiffany was wrong. 
  I'm sorry that I ever felt sympathy for Ryan. 
  I hope you're at peace. 
  BESS: Do you think the ghost in the freezer is Tiffany? 
  Your mom is our help? 
  To get rid of the ghost, just place the ring back on Tiffany's finger. 
  It'll help guide the ghost back into her body. 
  So place this over her heart, otherwise, it can get distracted and end up somewhere else.

  Nancy Drew 1x05 The Case of the Wayward Spirit NANCY: Lucy Sable and Karen Hart. 
  Friends. 
  The girl who became the ghost haunting me, and the detective who lied about ever knowing her. 
  - Dead Lucy wanted me to find this photo. 
  - Which means I have to talk to the one person I'd rather avoid to find out why. 
  (LINE RINGING) 
  This is Detective Karen Hart. 
  - Please leave a message. 
  - (BEEPS) 
  When should we worry? 
  Never. 
  About what? 
  Well, I thought this town loved its ghost stories. 
  We actually have a ghost sighting, and nobody seems to care. 
  Ghosts are great for business. 
  It's the murder that kills you. 
  Is this seriously the only Band-Aid size we have in the first aid kit? 
  I cut my finger, I didn't impale myself on a window pane. 
  Hey, what happened? 
  - I don't know. 
  - Oh. 
  Okay. 
  I woke up and my finger was all bloody. 
  You know, you should really disinfect that. 
  Yeah, you know what you should do? 
  Call your friend back. 
  She left four messages for you. 
  Lizzy, Beth, Lizzboot, whatever her name is. 
  Her number's in the reservation book. 
  - Lisbeth? 
  - Lady van driver. 
  Why don't you call her back? 
  (ENTRY BELL JINGLES) 
  GEORGE: Hi, welcome to the Claw. 
  Go ahead and sit wherever you'd like. 
  Oh, um, I'm actually here to see if you guys might be able to cater a party. 
  Today. 
  Today? 
  Like today today? 
  Yeah. 
  Short notice, I know. 
  I'm sorry. 
  It's for the charity gala at the country club. 
  Our caterer dropped out last-minute. 
  Was it the minute the Hudsons commandeered the gala to announce the Tiffany Hudson charity? 
  Ah, that sounds like the minute I'm talking about. 
  The big families take turns hosting each year and raise money for their pet charities. 
  The Marvins were supposed to host this year, and ACE: Hudsons swooped in? 
  OWEN: Something like that. 
  Uh, anyway, I was helping put it together and now I I guess I'm helping the Hudsons. 
  That's so nice of you. 
  ACE: It's ironic, though. 
  The restaurant that served Tiffany her last meal being hired to cater a gala in her honor. 
  Th that's pretty wild. 
  To be fair, I tried a few other places first. 
  Nobody's up to the challenge. 
  - (PHONE RINGS) 
  - We are. 
  We'll do it. 
  You're a lifesaver. 
  Yeah. 
  Here. 
  Take his order. 
  We are so excited to cater this event. 
  You won't regret it. 
  (PHONE CONTINUES RINGING) 
  - What? 
  - RYAN: Why did you come into my house - last night? 
  - I didn't. 
  Yeah, well, somebody entered the alarm code, and nobody has that code except for you and Tiffany. 
  Okay, I don't know what to tell you, Ryan. 
  Look, George, somebody came into my bedroom. 
  They turned on the shower, they-they-they left the water running, and then they wrote something on the mirror. 
  In blood. 
  Maybe you've been sleepwalking. 
  I got to go. 
  Okay? 
  Some of us actually have to work for a living. 
  (INDISTINCT CHATTER OVER RADIO) 
  Morning, Nancy. 
  How can I help you? 
  I'm just here to see Karen. 
  She's not in right now. 
  Okay, I'll leave a note on her desk. 
  You can't go in. 
  New policy. 
  Chief wants to keep our new investigation free of civilian interference. 
  Sorry. 
  New investigation. 
  Is McGinnis considering it a homicide because of what my father said at the press conference? 
  About Tiffany's autopsy report being compromised? 
  Because I would be happy to convey any details about the investigation to him while he's away in Boston on business. 
  You know I can't talk about an ongoing investigation. 
  Officer Rawley. 
  Do you remember how I found your grandma's lost jewelry collection? 
  You owe me. 
  You've been playing that card with me since you were in eighth grade. 
  (PHONE BUZZING) 
  - No - It's-it's nothing personal. 
  (ENTRY BELL JINGLES) 
  - (BELL JINGLES) 
  - ACE: Coming in. 
  Where's George? 
  She was chopping celery for potato salad. 
  She cut her hand pretty bad. 
  BESS: Yeah. 
  ACE: I went and offered her the first aid kit, and then she kind of just sat there, staring, for a long time. 
  BESS: Yeah. 
  ACE: Bleeding. 
  Then she went to her office and locked herself inside. 
  Hey, George? 
  (GEORGE GRUNTS LOUDLY) 
  - George? 
  - (GEORGE GRUNTING) 
  George, open the door! 
  (SIGHS) 
  Oh. 
  What is she doing? 
  Yeah, it might be time to worry. 
  (SEAGULLS SQUAWKING) 
  ACE: Could be stress. 
  Last-minute catering this big, fancy event. 
  What? 
  No, this isn't stress. 
  - ACE: What else could it be? 
  - BESS: I don't know. 
  Maybe something supernatural? 
  Right, because that's the go-to explanation. 
  Yeah. 
  Around here, it can be. 
  NANCY: Let's just consider the possibility. 
  What kind of supernatural thing could make her act like that? 
  Ooh! 
  She put the ring on Tiffany's body. 
  Did something go wrong with the ritual? 
  Bess filled me in on what you guys did at the funeral. 
  We're platanchors now, so she tells me things. 
  When you're not around. 
  What could've gone wrong? 
  She returned the ring, Tiffany's coffin went into the ground And she was supposed to leave the mirror on her heart so the spirit would know where to stay. 
  But we would verify that that did or did not happen how? 
  Ooh! 
  Let's check George's locker. 
  We know you're good at that. 
  Come on. 
  (GASPS) 
  I knew it. 
  Let's think this through logically. 
  Hello? 
  I am being logical. 
  Mirror equals botched ritual. 
  Therefore, George is possessed. 
  (ENTRY BELL JINGLES) 
  Welcome to The Claw. 
  What happened? 
  Celery mishap. 
  What can I help you with? 
  You and Laura Tandy are close, right? 
  We're friendly. 
  As a gentleman, I can't discuss it further. 
  Yeah, she, um she broke into my place last night. 
  What? 
  Yeah, she didn't care about what was in my safe. 
  She ignored the bearer bonds. 
  She went straight for the empty box. 
  Or, at least, I thought it was empty. 
  Now how'd she manage that? 
  - Screwdriver. 
  - I mean, how'd she know to look for what Tiffany hid there? 
  Sisters, man. 
  If Tiffany wanted Laura to have that flash drive, she would have given it to her. 
  But she didn't. 
  She left it for me. 
  Now, I need your help to get it back. 
  You're you're "friendly" with her. 
  Hey, George. 
  Didn't see you there. 
  What's she doing? 
  She's moving. 
  It gets freaky when she starts moving. 
  Everything okay, George? 
  No, no, no, no, no, no. 
  She's possessed by Tiffany. 
  (LOCK BUZZES) 
  No, that's not possible. 
  Ooh. 
  - (CAMERA CLICKS) 
  - BESS: What are you doing? 
  Okay, let's just go with the idea for a second that this is Tiffany. 
  So she kept scratching out George's face in all those photos. 
  So you want to show her she is George. 
  You know how crazy this sounds, right? 
  - Oh. 
  - Whoa, whoa, be careful, be careful. 
  NICK: Ooh, she didn't like that. 
  That's a good call, Nancy. 
  Why is nobody working? 
  We have a party to cater. 
  Go hug a fryer, now! 
  What is going on? 
  You're possessed. 
  By Tiffany. 
  NICK: Okay. 
  I think - we all need to calm down. 
  - No, it's for real. 
  Check it out. 
  When she was you, this is what she did. 
  Bitch. 
  Bad news: Tiffany doesn't like you. 
  The good news is Tiffany's dead, so I'm sorry, Nick. 
  The other bad news is that Tiffany's spirit has been hitching a ride in your body. 
  Intermittently. 
  I think we should take you home. 
  Good news: we can ask your mom all about it. 
  ("LOVE MAZE" BY SHAN DI AND ASAMI TANAKA PLAYING) 
  NANCY: The House of Fan, where George is the breadwinner and the real adult. 
  Her sisters all have different dads, none of whom stuck around. 
  Turn that down. 
  Your sister's fighting off a ghost. 
  - Can I see? 
  - No, Ted. 
  Help Jesse braid her hair. 
  (SIGHS) 
  VICTORIA: So, you had contact with Tiffany's spirit when you returned her ring to her. 
  What happened? 
  Did you mess up the ritual? 
  Yeah. 
  She forgot the mirror. 
  You forgot the m It's a two-step ritual. 
  How do you forget step two? 
  I was under a lot of pressure, okay? 
  VICTORIA: You were dealing with a brand-new ghost. 
  They are the most dangerous because they're looking for a body to inhabit. 
  So I'm possessed. 
  Of course. 
  Why can't this stuff happen to Bess? 
  - At least she'd actually enjoy it. 
  - Hey! 
  Possession is not a joke. 
  - Ted. 
  - Ted! 
  Come on. 
  (SONG CONTINUES PLAYING) 
  - We don't have time for this. 
  - NANCY: George. 
  Can you answer your mom's questions? 
  You're blacking out, you're hurting yourself. 
  VICTORIA: You could end up hurting your little sisters. 
  (INHALES) 
  Okay. 
  In order for me to help you, I need to have the full picture. 
  (BREATHLESS) 
 : Oh, the picture. 
  Yeah. 
  I have it. 
  Thank you. 
  Whoa. 
  This spirit hates you, like, really hates you. 
  She can't stand your face. 
  Why does she hate you so much? 
  Hey, Bess, can we have a second? 
  No, i-it's fine. 
  I had an affair with Tiffany's husband. 
  - It's over - You had an affair with a married man? 
  Ooh, and so much older than you? 
  How could you make such a mistake? 
  I don't know. 
  Genetics? 
  - Hey. 
  - And I don't want to talk about it, okay? 
  BESS: No. 
  Totally, totally. 
  And BTDubs, no judgement. 
  This is worse than I thought because this spirit has a reason to hate you. 
  And soon, she's gonna be strong enough to devour your qi, - your life force. 
  - And then what happens? 
  Then, Tiffany is gonna take up permanent residence in George's body and George will be gone, forever. 
  (HERBS CRUSHING IN MORTAR AND PESTLE) 
  So, what are these herbs for? 
  Tea. 
  To build up George's yang. 
  It'll keep Tiffany's spirit down for now. 
  How long does "for now" last? 
  VICTORIA: I don't know. 
  Days? 
  Hours? 
  It's tough to say. 
  I've never dealt with a possession before. 
  But the longer Tiffany's spirit is in George's body, the stronger she'll become. 
  - She'll regain her memories - Wait. 
  Including memories from the night that she died? 
  Because if that's the case, I can ask her what happened. 
  No. 
  That's pretty insensitive, don't you think? 
  I'm trying to solve her murder. 
  How is that insensitive? 
  Talking to Tiffany will take up time we don't have. 
  You can barely manage a trip to the grocery store. 
  What makes you think you know anything about possession? 
  I have aunties in China who've told me stories. 
  I can ask them what to do. 
  In the meantime, drink. 
  Here. 
  What the hell's in this? 
  Dried poop? 
  BESS: No, drink, drink. 
  Come on. 
  Let's think of your yang. 
  I hate the way that sounds when you say it. 
  Okay, what do we do next? 
  Ooh, we could tie her to a chair. 
  - I've seen that. 
  - No. 
  Stress allows the spirit to come out. 
  George needs to be relaxed. 
  GEORGE: You know what relaxes me? 
  Money. 
  We have a huge catering gig today. 
  Charlie hides money under her bed. 
  Don't you dare touch that. 
  She's saving up for BTS. 
  I'll meet you at the country club. 
  BESS: I asked Nick to fill in for me. 
  I thought I could stay with Victoria to work on our plan. 
  - You are a nice girl. 
  - Thank you. 
  In the meantime, keep George calm and call me the second Tiffany's spirit tries to come out. 
  Yeah, I can work with that. 
  You can trust us with your life. 
  - (BAND MUSIC PLAYING) 
  - (INDISTINCT CHATTER) 
  How you feeling? 
  (SIGHS) 
  Like I'm gonna be peeing herbal tea for a week. 
  Hey, I got this one. 
  Sorry, who are you? 
  Owen. 
  We're done setting up the speaker system. 
  I saw you over here and I wanted to come pitch in. 
  Not just you. 
  You guys. 
  All you people. 
  Caterers. 
  In need of help. 
  (OWEN CHUCKLES) 
  How creepy am I coming off? 
  Only moderately. 
  (METAL CLATTERING) 
  Last one. 
  I got it, but thank you. 
  You keep staring at me like that, you're gonna have to buy me dinner. 
  (WHISPERING): Nancy. 
  We can't pass appetizers in the same place. 
  That's not how this works, okay? 
  You appetize in here. 
  I will take the lawn. 
  I'm fine. 
  NANCY: Or I'll keep an eye on you out here while we maintain the pretense of normalcy. 
  (EERIE BREATHING ECHOES) 
  (SHOUTS, GRUNTS) 
  Whoa. 
  (PANTING) 
  Karen. 
  Uh, I didn't know you'd be here. 
  I'm on the board of the charity. 
  Community liaison. 
  Wait, is something wrong? 
  You keep ignoring my calls. 
  Yeah, I've been a little busy. 
  You said you didn't know Lucy Sable. 
  You lied to me. 
  Why? 
  Guilt. 
  Lucy and I were best friends all the way through junior year in high school until we weren't. 
  Well, what happened? 
  I-I don't know. 
  She just started pulling away. 
  It was after this party one night in early fall. 
  A year later, someone killed her. 
  W-Wait, what kind of party? 
  All I know is it was some exclusive underground thing. 
  Lucy's why I became a cop. 
  But by the time I left the academy and moved back to Horseshoe Bay, this town had turned my best friend into an urban legend. 
  Wait, why are you so fixated on her? 
  It's a long story, but I think I have a new angle on the Tiffany Hudson case. 
  And next week you'll be arraigned on felony charges for breaking into the morgue to gain access to Tiffany's body. 
  Nancy, lay low. 
  That's not really my strong suit. 
  OWEN: I think this belongs to you? 
  Owen, right? 
  I heard your company donated a building site for the outreach center. 
  The town appreciates it. 
  Think globally, develop locally. 
  Hmm. 
  You're a Marvin. 
  Yup. 
  I used to summer here. 
  Picture me 12 years younger, five inches shorter, and adorably rotund. 
  - (CHUCKLES) 
  - There we go. 
  She laughs. 
  On occasion. 
  Um, but I should get back Oh, God, I lost George. 
  You get the drive from Laura? 
  I did, but it came with Laura. 
  (FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING) 
  Is this where you apologize for breaking in my place? 
  I have impulse control issues. 
  She means she's sorry, but she does have impulse control issues. 
  LAURA: Tiffany told me about how she was collecting information on the Hudsons, to take the family down, but then she just stopped talking about it. 
  She tried to take the Hudsons down, and then she died. 
  She was trying to protect you, Laura. 
  She wanted me to have the drive. 
  Then why did she use a hiding spot only I would know about? 
  ACE: These are all good questions, both sides. 
  I just think that if, in the effort of teamwork, we can, like, share some information, maybe you Listen, I didn't come here to hand this over, okay? 
  I came here to get the password. 
  The only thing on this drive is a link to an anonymous site that's password-protected. 
  There's only one more chance before I'm locked out for good. 
  Right, so I was thinking we could ask George for the password. 
  George? 
  You know. 
  George. 
  What are you talking about? 
  Nothing. 
  It's crazy. 
  Look, if you just give me the drive, - I can - We do this together, or not at all. 
  RYAN: Hey, Owen, I've been looking for you. 
  You owe me a call about our deal. 
  I've heard some things. 
  Yeah, listen, Owen, if this is about my wife, I can assure It's not. 
  Your father told me about your track record. 
  He said you lost hundreds of millions of dollars, everything you had at Hudson Enterprises. 
  I'm on my way to making it back. 
  You can't be risk-averse. 
  That's just business, Owen. 
  That's not how I do business. 
  (TRAY CLATTERS) 
  (JAZZ MUSIC PLAYING) 
  George is definitely MIA. 
  I called Bess. 
  She's coming with Victoria. 
  This is all my fault. 
  I left her alone for one minute Hey, no, no, no. 
  It's okay. 
  We'll find her. 
  Now, I'll-I'll take outside and you take the upstairs. 
  You guys think Tiffany's back? 
  I think we need to find George, no matter what. 
  I'll help. 
  What were you saying about my sister? 
  Uh, nothing. 
  I heard you say "Tiffany", and I know you're hiding something from me 'cause you won't look me in the eye. 
  (GROANS) 
  Oh, man. 
  Tell me everything. 
  (ENGINE REVS) 
  Hey. 
  Um - Oh. 
  Hi. 
  Lisbeth. 
  - Hi, you. 
  Hi. 
  I'm a driver for the Hudsons. 
  Uh, I know. 
  - It's glamorous, right? 
  - No. 
  Um, no, I mean, you look great. 
  I just, uh, uh I should have returned your call. 
  Yeah. 
  Yeah, you should've. 
  - Yeah. 
  - To be honest, I'm shocked that you got my messages. 
  That girl who answers the phone at The Claw, - she is abrupt. 
  - Yeah. 
  Um, Lisbeth, can we just pretend those calls never happened? 
  Because you called my work and not me. 
  Right, right. 
  Yeah. 
  And in order for it to count as you officially blowing me off, - I have to call your cell phone. 
  - (CHUCKLES) 
  (QUIETLY): Here. 
  Oh, no. 
  - Oh, no, no, no. 
  - Is everything okay? 
  No. 
  Uh, yes. 
  It was really, really great to see you, but I've got to go. 
  - Where's Victoria? 
  - Um she's right behind me. 
  She's coming. 
  We came separately. 
  But I saw George. 
  And judging by the stunning cocktail dress she has on, Tiffany is walking the runway. 
  She has amazing taste, - even in death. 
  - I'll text Ace and let him know. 
  Um, we have to hurry if I'm gonna get the answers to my questions. 
  Uh, you-you mean if we're gonna save George's qi. 
  Of course. 
  Okay. 
 
 
 
  RYAN: Well, I appreciate you gentlemen coming. 
  Supporting the foundation means so much to the family. 
  Will you excuse me one second? 
  What are you doing here? 
  (WHISPERS): I know - about the waitress. 
  - Mm. 
  Mm-mm-mm. 
  Mm-mm. 
  Mm. 
  (MOANS) 
  No. 
  No, listen to me. 
  People are looking. 
  - I don't know what your play is right now, - NANCY: Hi. 
  - Mr. 
  Hudson? 
  - but you need to stop. 
  Hey. 
  They are asking for you inside. 
  - Something about a photo op. 
  - Thank you. 
  Go home. 
  They're asking about you, too. 
  This way. 
  I don't mean to scare you or freak you out, but we do not have a lot of time to talk. 
  So I'm gonna have to be very blunt. 
  I need you to tell me about the night that you died. 
  I'm not dead. 
  BESS: Tiffany! 
  You cannot stay in my daughter's body. 
  It's time for you to leave! 
  Tiffany, please try and remember the last moments of your life. 
  Otherwise, your murder could go unsolved. 
  A-And I'm just trying to help you. 
  Do you know me? 
  (EXHALES) 
  Tiffany used to do that - while we talked. 
  - BESS: Yeah. 
  It's about time you got on board. 
  In her defense, Victoria said that there's a lot of new ghosts out there that don't know they're dead yet. 
  Dead? 
  That's not your body. 
  Your body is in the ground. 
  W-We buried you yesterday. 
  Tiffany, I am so sorry. 
  We think you were murdered. 
  NANCY: We're trying to figure out who wanted you dead. 
  No. 
  - (DISTORTED): No! 
  - VICTORIA: Hey, hey. 
  Wait. 
  Is this the girl you told me about? 
  Sorry, guys. 
  She knows everything. 
  Laura. 
  Is it you? 
  Oh, my God, Tiff. 
  Tiff, it's gonna be okay. 
  - We're gonna we're gonna help you. 
  - No, no, no, no, no, no. 
  She is kind of killing our friend right now. 
  - So she has to go. 
  - What are doing? 
  The incense will break the bond between Tiffany's spirit and George's body, and then we will banish her forever. 
  Banish? 
  No, no, no. 
  I have to talk to my sister. 
  There's no time for that! 
  Listen, listen, that waitress slept with your husband, okay? 
  - Hey! 
  Wait. 
  - You don't have to go. 
  - Fight, okay? 
  - No! 
  Hey! 
  No! 
  - Run, Tiffany! 
  - Hey! 
  No! 
  (YELPING) 
  (PANTING) 
  Okay. 
  Hey. 
  Whoa. 
  Hey, hey. 
  Come here. 
  (GRUNTING) 
  (PANTING) 
  Why are you acting so crazy? 
  Do you realize what you've done? 
  If my father finds out about that little stunt in the garden, he's gonna cut me off. 
  George, he's gonna - freeze me out of the family assets. 
  - Ryan, please, you have to help me. 
  - (PANTING) 
  - Why would I do that? 
  Huh? 
  - (GRUNTING) 
  - Hey. 
  Hey, stop playing with me, George. 
  Stop it. 
  Hey! 
  This is not a game, George! 
  This is my life! 
  Hey! 
  (DISTORTED): Go away! 
  No. 
  She's my daughter. 
  Leave her! 
  Yeah. 
  Yeah, I'm happy to. 
  Happy to. 
  (PANTING) 
  Easy. 
  NANCY: I know you're scared. 
  And you didn't deserve to die. 
  But neither does George. 
  And right now, her life is in your hands. 
  And I know she disrespected you. 
  And George knows that, too. 
  But she was young and she was lost and Ryan saw an opportunity with her. 
  And I'm asking you to forgive her. 
  VICTORIA: Tiffany, let my daughter live. 
  (GASPS) 
  VICTORIA: We have to move quick. 
  East. 
  West. 
  (WIND WHOOSHING) 
  - Awesome. 
  - VICTORIA: Nick! 
  North! 
  I will solve your murder. 
  Nancy won't give up on finding out what happened. 
  And neither will I. 
  (SHOUTS IN MANDARIN) 
  Look, I don't want to ask you to go, but I can't let George die. 
  I'll-I'll stay with you. 
  I'll stay with you to the end. 
  (DISTORTED): Keep Laura safe. 
  I promise you, I will. 
  DantÃ¨s. 
  (VICTORIA REPEATEDLY SHOUTING MANDARIN WORD) 
  Remember me. 
  (SHOUTING STOPS) 
  George? 
  Hey, hey, George is it you? 
  Hey, careful. 
  Not too fast. 
  Wait, where's Ryan? 
  I remember he He took off. 
  He's probably headed somewhere in his limo by now. 
  - Are you okay? 
  - VICTORIA: She'll make a full recovery. 
  We've banished Tiffany from the earthly realm, and now I'll go summon an Uber. 
  Hey, I'm I'm glad you're all right. 
  Are you okay? 
  Yeah. 
  And, um, I I think I understand what Tiffany was trying to tell me. 
  Go. 
  I get it. 
  Did you get what you wanted? 
  Yeah. 
  You didn't die. 
  I'll figure out another way to solve Tiffany's murder. 
  So, what was it like being possessed by Tiffany? 
  Was it all, "Boo"? 
  No. 
  It wasn't all like, "Boo" (SIGHS): It was like a radio tuned to pure emotions. 
  I hated it. 
  I don't want to talk about it. 
  Okay, Drew. 
  Okay. 
  NANCY: Pure emotion. 
  So that'show ghosts work. 
  Then what was Lucy emotionally attached to? 
  Maybe something she wanted me to unearth. 
  I promise you I'll take care of it. 
  - I thought we were in this together. 
  - Laura, your sister told me to keep you out of this and keep you safe. 
  I got to respect her wishes. 
  Without Nick's password, you're gonna get locked out of the site forever. 
  If you want answers, you're gonna have to trust us. 
  At least trust me. 
  I do. 
  But I'm beginning to regret it. 
  Hello again. 
  So when you're not busy organizing parties and offering to help cater-waiters you don't know and wearing fancy suits, you are in real estate, right? 
  I mean, the Marvins are famed for wheeling and dealing in properties. 
  Wheeling and dealing is that what they say about us in town? 
  They say you're in construction, too. 
  - That part is true. 
  - So still want to make yourself useful? 
  ACE: Laura had all these guesses for the password. 
  It really bothered her to get shut out. 
  Yeah, she's gonna forgive you, bro. 
  I don't know. 
  She's a woman of strong emotions. 
  - There was one time that - Ace, Ace. 
  I'd love to hear about it - after we get into these files. 
  - Yeah. 
  A story for another time. 
  Okay, the drive contains exactly one thing. 
  It's a masked URL. 
  A secret website. 
  Password-protected. 
  (SIGHS): Okay. 
  First book Tiffany gave me. 
  It's the first password I would have tried. 
  ACE: Hey. 
  Regular backups to the cloud. 
  Okay, what was the what was the last thing she added? 
  "Ryan's getting desperate. 
  Invited rival to dinner for five. 
  Pine Hill won't be happy to see me there. 
  His family sees me as a threat". 
  Hey, hey, there's a folder labeled Pine Hill. 
  Old shareholder reports. 
  Insurance statements. 
  New documents signed by the officer of the corporation. 
  - NICK: Owen Marvin? 
  - That's Mr. 
  Calamari Spender, from the party. 
  You think he had something to do with Tiffany's death? 
  (BUZZING) 
  You think this'll do the trick? 
  (CHUCKLES): I I mean, I thought you would have an electric shovel or something. 
  You mean an earth auger? 
  (CHUCKLES): What? 
  That's the name for it. 
  I just mean this seems extreme. 
  Well I'm an extremely useful guy. 
  Where are we headed again? 
  The lawn of my old high school. 
  Plaque marks the spot. 
  (SIGHS): Okay. 
  Mission Excavate Time Capsule. 
  I can't remember the last time I had this much fun. 
  Mm. 
  That's depressing, Owen. 
  There's a whole new fire Burning inside And where it's going Nobody knows Beneath the sun Into the rain - What goes around's coming back again - Do you know, do you know Do you know we're all on a wandering star? 
  Wherever you are Whoever you are Where will you go? 
  What will you do? 
  There is no path there in front of you You'll find a way Before the end Pulling on The golden thread Do you know, do you know Do you know we're all On a wandering star? 
  Whoever you are. 
  NANCY: Sorry, Class Day 1999. 
  I know you wanted this bad boy cracked open a hundred years from now. 
  And I'm sure the denizens of the future would have been fascinated by this enormous cell phone. 
  Or a packet of poetry from The Alliterators. 
  Or that toothbrush? 
  Seriously? 
  But I think Lucy wants me to find something else. 
  That's a little on the nose, but sure. 
  (LIVELY MUSIC PLAYING) 
  TEEN GIRL: Well, hello there. 
  Greetings from 1999. 
  How cool is this! 
  Our very own time capsule video in honor of Class Day. 
  NANCY: Is that Lucy? 
  I've been trying to imagine what senior year will look like, and I think I've been trying I've been trying trying trying trying trying rying rying rying rying rying rying ryin, ryin, ryin Ryin Ryan? 
  - ryin, ryin, ryin, - Are you saying ? 
  - ryin, ryin - Ryan. 
  Ryan Hudson?
