 Emma : Here's the thing. We have to push her boundaries. 
 Mm-hmm. 
 Okay? 
 Because she's playing it way too safe. 
 Yeah, I know. 
 I mean, her body be banging. We've established that. 
 I can hear everything you girls are saying about me. 
 Tina, can you please come out and show us? 
 Maggie : We can't help you if we don't see it. 
 God, she's tough. 
 Tough nut to crack. 
 Yeah. 
 Whoa! 
 Whoa, whoa! 
 Mamacita, mamacita. 
 Ay, ay, ay, ay! Damn, girl. 
 Oh, my God, give me that. 
 Look at this. 
 Give me that sweet stuff, girl. 
 This is crazy. 
 Yes to the dress. 
 I feel very exposed. 
 Okay, Mark is gonna lose his mind when he sees you in this dress. 
 Oh, I don't know, I doubt he'll even notice it. 
 Look how good you look in this picture, even under these fluorescents. 
 I'm gonna send it to him. 
 That is a lot of skin. 
 Tina, it is our responsibility, as citizens of these United States of America, to purchase you this dress. 
 Mm-hmm, mm-hmm. 
 I don't know. 
 And that dress, honey, is complimentary... 
 both : To your butt! 
 I'm gonna get another shot of this. 
 I didn't even know you had a butt. 
 I do. [laughs] I do have a butt. 
 Got it. 
 You know what? 
 Let's go for it. 
 [cheering] 
 All right, first disco purchase. 
 Girlfriend time is fun. 
 We should really do this again. 
 Absolutely, absolutely. 
 We should. 
 Okay, good, 'cause I signed us up for an all ladies woodworking class. 
 What's that now? 
 We're gonna learn to build our own birdhouses! 
 Are you girls in? 
 That... 
 Yes! I'll bring my toolbox. 
 What about you, Emma? 
 You know what it is... ah!

 Birds are doing it for themselves. 
 Think I wanna be here? I don't need this. 
 But we are here because we are being good girlfriends. 
 There she is. 
 Maggie, Emma, I'm so excited you made it.

 Greetings, ladies. 
 I'm Buck Finch. 
 I'm a master woodworker. 
 And today I'm going to take you on a journey that's gonna crack you all wide open. 
 Good-ness. 
 Ladies, in front of you, you have a piece of lumber. 
 Go ahead. Touch it. 
 Cup it at the base. 
 Get comfortable with the wood in your hands. 
 Mm. [chuckles] How's it feel? 
 Oh, hard. 
 Wrong. 
 Because in the right hands, a hard wood can be made soft. 
 And a soft wood can be made hard. 
 [slap] 
 Mm. 
 And a knotty pine, that can be made as smooth as the inside of a woman's thigh.

 He did. Yes, he did.

 We've just been sanding the same piece of wood for 45 minutes. 
 This is basic. 
 Hey, how's it going over there, Teens? 
 I'm loving it. 
 Hey there. What's your name? 
 Oh, I'm Maggie. 
 You're doing some great work there, Maggie. 
 Yeah, I know. 
 Okay. 
 All right. 
 Ah, mind if I look at your bird entry there, Tina? 
 It's all yours. 
 Buck : Very smooth. 
 Well, you just keep doing what you're doing, 'cause you're doing everything right. 
 Oh, hey, Buck, do you want to check my bird entry? 
 I don't have to. You have a rough hole. 
 Very unwelcoming. 
 My hole is very welcoming. Ask anyone. 
 [upbeat music] 
 Last week, I had a drop-off at Shirley Lambert's house. 
 Oh, I saw she had another wreath up on her door. 
 Another week, another wreath. 
 This one is just a bunch of dirty flip-flops hot glued in a circle. 
 Excuse me, what holiday is that? 
 Gek. 
 [laughter] 
 Anyway, so she goes, "Do you want a Diet Coke?" 
 And so of course I said, "Excuse me?" 
 Because, you know, I... 
 You... 
 [together] Can't say "no" to a Diet Coke. 
 I know. 
 [laughter] 
 So I'm sitting in her kitchen, and what do you know, but Shirley Lambert walks in stark naked. 
 [gasps] Rod, no. 
 Maggie, yes. 
 Excuse me. 
 Excuse me. 
 Excuse me? 
 Oh, Emma, you know our delivery guy, Rod Rockemoor? 
 Of course, hello. 
 Emma. 
 Ooh, so great to see that bleaching system you ordered is working out. 
 You can hardly see any dark hairs at all... eh. 
 Eh. 
 Eh. 
 Well, Maggie, I gotta scoot, but I will see you tomorrow. 
 All right, bye now. 
 Oh, God, that guy. 
 What is the delivery man doing in our house? 
 He is a human being, and his name is Rod. 
 Well, it's inappropriate. 
 Maybe you should spend less time gab, gab, gabbing and more time build, build, building this birdhouse of mine. 
 Absolutely not... you need to learn the lesson of building the birdhouse yourself. 
 Ugh. 
 There's gonna be a lot of birds that are going to be very unhappy. 
 Well, they can come on over to my triple townhouse, have a grand old time. 
 Ugh. 
 Just one last piece and you're mine. 
 Whoa, wait, no, whoa! 
 Can you make these pieces look like a birdhouse? 
 Emma! 
 What? 
 I was in the midst of solving a crime right here. 
 Do you understand? 
 What crime? 
 Somebody wrote the word "turd" on every single vending machine in town. 
 It's just like The Wire, huh? 
 Where's McNulty when you need him? 
 Hey, listen, I really do need you to build that birdhouse for me though, okay? 
 Why are you building a birdhouse? 
 I'm in that dumb class with your wife. 
 Didn't she tell you? 
 Maybe she did. She says a lot of things. 
 Well, she's making us take this woodworking class, and I need to build a birdhouse. 
 Why don't you just ask your boyfriend, the rabbi, to do it? 
 I'm sorry, he's too busy leading the spiritual lives of people. 
 Okay, so thank you very much. 
 N-n-n-n-n-no. Don't leave this here. 
 I have other crimes to solve. 
 What, like who wrote "burglar" under the word "turd"? 
 That was me. 
 Crawford, are you kidding me? 
 You did not build that birdhouse. 
 Yes, I did. I built it all night long in my room. 
 Uh-huh, you fell asleep at 7:45 watching the burn victim episode of Downton Abbey. 
 Don't you think I didn't notice. 
 Okay, but what happened was, I woke up in the middle of a dream, and I was like, "Oh, my God, this is how I build a birdhouse." 
 And I was like... [clicks tongue] 
 Uh-huh, uh-huh. 
 And I just built it. 
 Oh, shut up, shut up. 
 Buck : That's it, so smooth. 
 Well, he seems to find her hole a-very welcoming. 
 God, I wonder who it is. 
 I don't know. 
 You're doing a heck of a job. 
 You're a great teacher. 
 [both gasp] Bird Bones. 
 Oh. [laughs] 
 Wow. 
 Okay, this is bad. 
 Okay. We have to make it stop. 
 How do we make it stop? 
 I don't know. I don't know. 
 Do something, Maggie. 
 Um, um, um... 
 [screams] 
 Oh! 
 My birdhouse that I built myself. 
 What a klutz. 
 [laughs] 
 What are you two kids up to? 
 Buck is teaching me how to use the hand planer. 
 And let me tell you, there is nothing plain about it. 
 [laughter] 
 I'm gonna head back to the hand planer. You wanna come? 
 Okay. 
 All right. 
 You're gonna want to find the hole. 
 Don't... don't jam it. Just give it a nice, slow push. 
 Well, at least we know why he wasn't into me. 
 Yeah, that's the thing we're taking away from this. 
 Okay, here's the thing I don't understand. 
 They didn't act caught at all. 
 Mm, so they clearly haven't done the nasty. 
 Yet. 
 [squeals and claps] 
 You're a natural. 
 You're an absolute natural. 
 All right, we have to stop this before it starts. 
 N-n-n-n-no. We are not touching this with a 10-foot pole. 
 Do you remember the last time I got involved in a "Mark and Bird Bones" situation? 
 It did not end well. 
 We have to, okay? We are her only friends. 
 There is no one else to warn her. 
 Buck : That was amazing. 
 Thanks for the demo, Tina. 
 Probably the best one I've ever had. I mean that. 
 Ladies, if I could have your attention, please. 
 I have a confession to make. 
 Not only do I teach women how to work with wood, but I'm also a DJ for hire. [laughs] 
 And I'm gonna be throwing down some hot jams tonight at Snuffy's Clam Bar, and I sure hope I see you all down there. 
 Hard pass. 
 No, thank you. 
 I'll be there, Buck. 
 Thanks, Tina. 
 [sighs] 
 Us too. 
 We will also be there. 
 [wood creaking] 
 So, Tina, that Buck is really something, isn't he? 
 Oh, I am learning so much from him. 
 Yeah. 
 Hmm. 
 He told me he wants to take me to the lumberyard next week. 
 Wait, what? 
 He's gonna put you in his car? 
 Yeah, he wants me to experience all the different woods that the world has to offer. 
 Okay, okay. 
 Is that right? 
 Sometimes, Tina, um... we can get too close in a relationship without even realizing it's happening. 
 Yeah, suddenly... 
 And then you're just in it. 
 You know? 
 You're enmeshed. 
 Yeah, and you're like, uh-oh. 
 Does that make sense? 
 This is too close. 
 Right. 
 'Cause I don't really know you. 
 Mm-hmm. 
 Totally. 
 Wait, what are you saying? 
 Um... 
 Let me take this. 
 Maggie : I thought that was pretty clear. 
 Por ejemplo... 
 That's, uh, "for example" in Spanish. 
 Maggie here has an inappropriate relationship with our delivery guy. 
 Oh, come on. 
 You invited a delivery person into our sunroom. 
 He just put his gammy in a home, and he was feeling very sad. 
 See what I'm talking about, Tina? 
 I think I understand. 
 It's like you and Mark. 
 What now? 
 Well, that relationship was inappropriate. 
 Okay, I don't... let's... 
 I think we can just moveon.org about that. 
 Okay, I'm going to give it to you straight, Buck Finch is trying to s*x you. 
 What? No. 
 He definitely has a thing for you. 
 He just likes my birdhouse. 
 Okay, well, he doesn't give me that kind of personal attention, and my birdhouse is phenomenal. 
 Well, it's just a little basic. 
 Oh, God. 
 What did you say to me? 
 Okay. 
 I said it was basic. 
 Say that again, Teens. 
 It's basic. 
 No, Tina, please don't say it again. 
 No, say it again. 
 Don't say it again. 
 Say it again. 
 You keep saying "Say it again." 
 Don't do it. 
 Say it again. 
 Please don't, Tina. 
 Basic.

 Your cruiser was in the driveway, but you weren't answering the front door. 
 That's because I didn't want to be bothered. 
 Why? What are you doing in here? Oh, my God. 
 Is this a train set? 
 It is not a train set. 
 It is a tabletop railroad modeling system, set in a miniature Pinebrook. 
 Man, this is bananas. 
 I don't know, I just kinda go to work, and then I come home, and I work on this. 
 [gasps] Is that our house? 
 Yeah, look in that window right there. 
 Oh, my God, there's a baby Charlotte. 
 Okay, that is cute. 
 And look right next to it, that's Maggie. 
 Yeah. 
 And then I don't have a model for you yet, so I just... 
 I've been using a Grimace from a Happy Meal. 
 All right. 
 Hey, listen, I need you to build this birdhouse again. 
 W-what happened to the first one I built? 
 Well, the students were so jealous of it because of how good it was that they destroyed it. 
 Yeah, I'll make an inferior one. 
 Okay. 
 Yeah, yeah, that makes sense. 
 So, uh, Tina mention anything about this class we're in? 
 Nope, nope, I only know about it because you keep talking about it. 
 Huh, that's interesting. 
 What? 
 Oh, I just think maybe you should spend a little less train time and a little more Tina time, you know? 
 [sighs] Okay, listen. She does her thing. 
 I do my thing. It's just much easier that way. 
 Sure, sure, sure, but you know what? 
 Sometimes you gotta, like, meet them in the middle, you know? 
 Like, we got a DJ thing we're going to tonight. 
 Maybe you could come, hang with your wife? 
 Emma, what are you doing? 
 Nothing. 
 I'm just a friend, you know, looking out for another friend. 
 Oh, no! Oh, Postmaster Terry. 
 Oh, God. Oops. 
 Oh, God.

 I will build it. Get out. Get away from it.

 You will not believe what I just saw at Shirley Lambert's house. 
 Oh, my God. Was she naked again? 
 Worse. She was painting her piano.

 Who paints a piano? 
 Shirley Lambert, that's who. 
 I know. 
 She's so crazy. 
 Hey, Rod, do you think that our relationship is inappropriate or that we, like, spend too much time gossiping? 
 No way. 
 My gammy says, "Gossip is God's friendship-glue." 
 Yeah, that's what I thought. 
 Yeah. 
 Hey, though, what do you know about Buck Finch? 
 How much Diet Coke do you have?

 What? 
 He's broken up 11 marriages in this county alone and four in the Philippines. 
 Ugh, that piece of sh1t. 
 Okay, well, you know what, Mark is too obsessed with his dumb train set to even care. 
 This is what we're gonna do.
