 He can be very important to us. 
 A jet plane man. Brilliant man. 
 I want you to take this German and get him wining and dining, and completely turn him around. 
 This is our real operation. 
 We have the capacity to listen to several rooms where we've parked people we're interested in. 
 That's the funny thing about this hotel. 
 I hear the Army is using it. Is that you? 
 Maybe bringing people over here who did things during the war that they need to answer for. 
 You have your job to do, Miss Griffiths, I understand. 
 But our job concerns matters of national security. 
 You're from T-Force, aren't you? 
 Oh, come on, surely you can tell me that. Can't you? 
 Did you see the doctor, Victor? 
 Yes, I did indeed. 
 And he gave you something for your headaches? 
 Oh, gloriously empty up here. 
 What is this really serious work you're doing that means you can't stay? 
 You don't want to lose them, I promise you. 
 You really don't want to find you've lost them. 
 I will not work for the British government. 
 Oh, it is you. My little one. 
 How nice to meet you again.

 [MUSIC ENDS] 
 Don't stop now! Come on! 
 There must be another number! There must be an encore. 
 Oh, you want another number, do you? 
 Well, honey, you may not have anything to do tomorrow, but I do. So, goodnight, everyone. 
 [APPLAUSE] 
 So the basement ballroom is well and truly reopened. 
 It was marvellous. Even if she was a little fierce, that singer. 
 Rather terrifying, in fact. 
 She is frightening, yes. 
 Oh, whoa! 
 What a beautiful old Rolls! 
 Yes, it's ancient, but it works. 
 And the seats... smell truly fantastic. 
 See what you think. 
 Ah, they do. 
 I must take that little girl shopping, by the way. 
 Oh, no, no, you really don't need to bother. 
 Oh, yes, I do. She can't wear that dress every evening. 
 Goodnight, my old friend. 
 And thanks for this evening. 
 Just you watch, you're not going to be able to get rid of us from now on. 
 Ah, Mr Ferguson. 
 The hotel came back to life, didn't it? 
 It did. 
 Do you think it's for one night only? 
 I've no idea. Who knows? 
 Quite right. Who knows? 
 We must let Mr Ferguson get back to his duties. 
 Whatever they might be. 
 Excuse me. Just a moment. 
 One moment. 
 Gentlemen, that was a tremendously interesting evening. 
 I can't think of anything else but this. 
 If it works, we may be able to see each other again. 
 I will visit you. 
 Excuse me. Excuse me. 
 I need your help. My room is on this floor, but the numbers go in the wrong order. 
 I will show you. Please help me, sir. 
 You see? 
 They jump... from five to one... 
 Thank you, everybody, yeah? 
 Sssssh! 
 So, Mr... 
 Ssh, ssh! 
 Mmh. 
 I just came to say goodnight. 
 I'm glad to see you had such a good evening. 
 You stayed for all of it. And more. 
 It was a good evening. 
 Perhaps even tremendous. 
 But it makes no difference to anything. 
 One night? How could it? 
 It doesn't matter how many nights, I have only one desire... to go home... and every time I see you, this is what I will tell you. 
 I will not cooperate with the plans you have for me, whatever you do, whatever happens. 
 Well, that's pretty clear. 
 You are here already, sir. 
 However early I am, you manage to beat me. 
 That's because I've got a very important assignment for you, Ringwood. 
 That's good, sir. 
 I want you to keep them at breakfast for as long as possible this morning. 
 I'm going to search his room. 
 You've done his room, sir. You tore the place to pieces. 
 Yes, but I didn't go through their things. 
 I know he's brought some work with him, he must have. 
 I know I would have done. 
 How many of these are you spying on, Mr Ringwood? 
 Listening to their conversations in their bedrooms. 
 It's only you, Mr Koehler. You're very special to us. 
 And we're not spying on you, not any more. 
 Now, a chance to have a real English breakfast. 
 We've all collected our ration books together so you can have an egg each and a slice of bacon. 
 That's not your room, is it? 
 No, it isn't. This isn't your floor, is it? 
 Oh, but you don't know that. 
 You don't know which is my real floor or where my room is. 
 No, I don't. This is true. 
 And you haven't tried very hard to find out, have you? 
 Well, don't let me keep you. 
 Whatever you're doing, you probably don't have a lot of time to do it. 
 We'll just have some toast, please. 
 Just toast? 
 No. You must have the eggs. We've arranged it. 
 We will have the toast and nothing else, please. 
 I don't know how you manage to make coffee taste like this. 
 Yes, quite. 
 That's one thing the war hasn't changed. 
 We have now finished, thank you. 
 No. Please... isn't there anything else you want? 
 No, thank you. Come, Lotte. 
 My God! 
 Mr Koehler, you must come and see this. 
 The light is amazing. So bright on all the buildings. 
 The views... 
 What are you doing? 
 What does it look like? 
 Given you won't talk to me about your work, I had to take the obvious course. 
 Which was crawling about my daughter's cupboard, was it? 
 So nothing is really private here. 
 Not quite yet, no. 
 But hopefully soon. 
 You know, I'd love to know why you hid the barley sugars, though. 
 They were for her. Of course I knew your customs would take them. 
 Well, here you go. 
 Now, don't lose them. 
 As for these, these I'm going to keep for a day or two. 
 You won't understand them. 
 Oh, we'll see. 
 I'm an engineer, remember? 
 I worked on jet engines before the war, so let's see if I can surprise you. 
 What is really interesting is not written down, of course. 
 It's in here. 
 Oh, naturally. 
 And that is what I am going to unlock. 
 Telephone call for Mr Ferguson. 
 It's me. I need your help, Cal. 
 What's wrong, Victor? 
 I find I'm on the floor and I can't move. 
 Come on, Victor. What are you doing on the floor? 
 Mrs Tooley will find me any moment and start yelling, and I don't know what will happen then. 
 You have to get yourself to the hospital, Victor. 
 Can you do that? Can you get there? 
 Yes. Yes, I can always do that, but they are bloody useless. 
 Right,  so you can move. You're not completely stuck. 
 Victor, I'll meet you there. 
 I have to see the brigadier first, but I can be there by 12. 
 Promise me you'll get yourself to the hospital, Victor. 
 But only for you, Cal. 
 Ah, Miss Griffiths. Believe it or not, I'm in a terrible hurry this morning, even worse than before, so I have to go. 
 Naturally. Since I've got you for a moment, I'll be quick. 
 Here's the list of names we're interested in. 
 Brigadier Wainwright has been sent it many times, so if there is anything you can do to make sure we get a response... 
 Yes, yes. I'll see if we can get any information on any of these names and I will get it sent straight back to you. 
 How long will it take? 
 Well, obviously I'll tell him that it's very urgent. 
 You will? 
 Yes. Why do you doubt that? 
 I just know that everything is called urgent at the moment, for everybody. 
 And of course, because we're on different sides, as it were, it's difficult and probably a bit of a nuisance for you. 
 You keep saying that we're on different sides. 
 As far as I'm concerned, that just isn't true. 
 Then prove it to me. 
 Right... quick as you can, Rogers. 
 But not if you kill any children on the way. 
 And that's all you've got? Notebooks from a doll's house? 
 It's full of interesting stuff. 
 I had a quick look. 
 But no. I don't have a happy German for you ready to work for us for the rest of his life and to give us all of his secrets. No. 
 He wants to go home. 
 The only place he's not going is home. 
 I will have these doll's books checked out, but we need him cooperating with us. 
 Well, someone else may do better than me. 
 They're going to have to, aren't they? 
 No-one else can do it better. You have to do it. 
 He could be of vital strategic importance. Just crack his resolve. 
 Trouble is I don't know how to do that, sir. 
 You've got a whole bloody hotel at your disposal. What more do you want? 
 Oh, since you ask, a piano in my room would be nice. 
 But I've only got three days left. It might not be worth it. 
 I lied. You've got four more days. 
 I can't do it in four days, I can tell you that now. 
 You're going to bloody have to. 
 What's more, there's this woman from the war crimes unit poking around. 
 Miss Griffiths, yes, I know. 
 She gave me a list of names to get checked. 
 I said that I would. 
 Well, give it to me. 
 Come on, give me the list. 
 She's not going to go away, sir. 
 Of course she isn't. 
 Has it occurred to you she could be useful to us if she's handled right? 
 Especially useful to you at this present moment. 
 How? 
 Oh, come on, Ferguson, I've never known you be slow on the uptake before. 
 And I can see you know exactly what I mean. 
 That's ridiculous. what are you doing eating that? 
 That's not all you've got to eat, is it? 
 What are you saying? You need some money, is that what you're saying? 
 I always need money, but these are good for you. 
 Try one. 
 No, thank you, I'm not eating a raw potato. 
 I've been waiting ages here for you, so these are in fact my second helping. 
 We need to get you some more medicine, something stronger. 
 You have to remain calm in there and tell them the truth. 
 So, you haven't had a job for three months since the incident when you struck your employer? 
 Well, I did not strike him. 
 I had a disagreement with him that could only be resolved one way. 
 I haven't hit anybody since. 
 Not unprovoked, anyway. 
 Yes, of course there have been times I've been provoked, but that's just unavoidable at the moment, as I'm sure you find yourself. 
 You say you have these migraines and that causes you not to be able to control your behaviour. 
 You have in fact presented yourself at this hospital several times recently, saying it's an emergency. 
 My brother's very keen to work, to lead a normal life again. 
 Like many people, his experiences during the war stay with him and... 
 It... it's not about the war. You're wrong. 
 You're the one who had the worst experiences. 
 These memories cause sudden changes in his mood, which can lead to some rather... chaotic behaviour. 
 I'm sorry, it's not about the war. It is about now. 
 It's about what's happening now. 
 And while we're about it, he's the one who has the nightmares. 
 And now he's the one who has to snatch people off the streets of Germany and then do anything to make them work for us. 
 Just shut up. Just stop this. 
 He has all these outfits with silly names. 
 MI19, T-Force Bios, chasing after them for results and none of them know what the other's doing. 
 Just stop this at once, Victor. 
 I'm sorry about this. 
 Yes, quite right. 
 He wants me to remain calm, but also tell the truth. 
 In case you were wondering, we... can of course afford to pay for any new treatment, although when this National Health Service starts, you won't need to keep thinking about that. 
 Victor. 
 What I will do, Mr Ferguson, is to refer you to a specialist as soon as possible. 
 Though in the meantime, I would suggest you find something to occupy your mind. 
 A lot of returning servicemen who have difficulties... find that something that occupies their mind each day is often... 
 I'm glad I don't occupy your mind. 
 I wouldn't want to be inside there, inside that dome. 
 What was that? What on earth was that? 
 What is the point if you're just going to be rude to everybody all the time and nobody is going to help you? 
 That doctor had no interest in helping me. 
 You don't know that. 
 No interest at all. 
 Well, believe it or not, I do. 
 And I am going to see you get well, Victor. I will. 
 And what was all that stuff about me? 
 I mean, why did you suddenly bring all that up? 
 I was only trying to tell the truth. 
 The truth? What, about me? 
 You don't know anything about me, Victor. 
 Don't I? 
 We'll see about that. 
 Getting nowhere with your German, are you? 
 In a bit of a panic? 
 No, there's no panic. 
 What? There's no panic. 
 No. I always have a plan. 
 I don't know why we have to do this, sir. 
 Treating them like film stars to try to make them work for us. 
 We won the f*cking war, didn't we? 
 They were the enemy until last year... 
 Sir... 
 ... until a few months ago. 
 I'm sorry, sir, excuse me, it just makes my blood boil. 
 It isn't right. 
 It is if it works. 
 I just came to tell you, you'll be eating all your meals in the basement ballroom from now on. 
 Where the music is and the food is much more interesting. 
 But I'm not allowed to go out still? 
 Even for a few minutes? 
 Not quite yet, no. 
 But everything you need will be provided here. 
 And I mean everything. 
 And... there's a large car about to arrive to take Lotte shopping. 
 There you are, Lotte. 
 It's so nice to see you, my dear. 
 Now, people tell me that it's impossible in this town. 
 But let's see if we can have a truly tremendous shop. 
 [JAZZ MUSIC PLAYS] 
 Oh, yeah! 
 Who are you? 
 Oh, what do you mean? 
 I don't know who you are, but you seem to have a lot of power in this hotel. 
 I don't have any power here, no. 
 You're lying. 
 I'm suddenly told that I have a booking here the next few nights which I have to accept. 
 And they pushed a lot of money into my face. 
 Well, who said that had anything to do it me? 
 Nobody did. 
 But I have a feeling it was you. 
 I don't know who you are really or what you're doing, but... you have influence. 
 That always makes me suspicious. 
 Oh, there's no need to be suspicious. 
 I ought to tell you, in the US, they think I'm a communist. 
 And are you a communist? 
 That's for you to find out. 
 Now, get the hell out of here, I'm busy. 
 Ah, well, well... never underestimate that old b*st*rd Wainwright. 
 I should know that. 
 We came to find you. 
 Oh, look! 
 You look wonderful! 
 I have a letter for you, Mr Ferguson. 
 From the lady, Mrs Rachel Lombard. 
 Oh, well, thank you.

 Pleasure to meet you. 
 That was a little obvious, don't you think? 
 Well, maybe a little bit, yes. 
 I will return to my room, now. 
 I believe Mrs Lombard is expecting me. 
 Mrs Lombard is up here. 
 Come on up, Cal. 
 I have to confess, it still takes me a moment or two to recognise my name. 
 Mrs Lombard! I'm still not quite used to it yet. 
 I was Mrs Gertz for a number of years, as you probably know. 
 I didn't know that, no. 
 Of course, I keep forgetting that you and Alex haven't really had a chance to catch up yet. 
 Well, Mr Gertz is no more. 
 He's been gone three years now. 
 He died. 
 I'm sorry. 
 That Gertz name seems to really stick to me for some reason. 
 Maybe it's because of all his money. 
 I hope you're not going to be shocked now, Cal. 
 Shocked? By what? 
 It's quite difficult to shock me. 
 By what this place looks like. 
 As you can see, I've pushed everything around because so much of the furniture was truly hideous. 
 But of course, one doesn't want to seem extravagant, what with the current shortages. 
 I want to create something that's a little more lovely. 
 You said in your note you had a favour to ask me? 
 She does! It's a very small favour, but I think she's a little bit embarrassed by it, aren't you, darling? 
 I am. 
 Look at this piano, Cal. 
 It's about the only splendid bit of furniture we have. 
 And it's totally undamaged, and perfectly in tune. 
 You must make Cal show you how good he is. 
 You must make him play, darling. He's terrific. 
 I'm really not any more. 
 We just have to get him to admit it. 
 Remember, Cal is very good at finding out the truth about everybody else. 
 Is he? Now I've been warned. 
 We go back a long way, of course. 
 Yes, Alex was always so good to me. 
 Opening doors after Oxford. 
 That's what close friends are for. 
 Exactly, but Cal never needed me, really. 
 He's a scholarship boy. 
 Ask him the favour. 
 First, Cal, you must answer this completely honestly, if you can. 
 I'll try. 
 So, would it be absolutely dreadful of me to hold a party? 
 [HE LAUGHS] 
 Why are you laughing? 
 I had no idea what you were going to say! 
 Of course it wouldn't! People still have parties. 
 I didn't know, having just arrived, if it was the right thing to do. 
 It's a terrible thing to say, but when I was here during the war... 
 I didn't know you'd been here before. 
 Yes, the beginning of '41. 
 Right in the middle of the Blitz. 
 My husband was a foreign emissary for the President. 
 And the awful thing is... and you'll hate me for saying this, but... 
 London was so exciting then. 
 Frightening, of course. 
 Everybody was living just for the next day. 
 But so full of ideas and hope, too. 
 It was extraordinary, the atmosphere. 
 That's not how I remember it, but then, I wasn't in London much. 
 No. You were doing incredibly important things. 
 Secret things. 
 Sometimes, yes. 
 And now I'm back here, and all the friends I knew before have vanished. 
 I don't know anybody, really. 
 So, a party seemed a good idea. 
 But, everybody is so... depressed and life is hard. 
 I don't want it to seem insensitive. 
 Vulgar, even. 
 Well, there's no danger of that. 
 Thank you. 
 So, what was the favour, Mrs Lombard? 
 Rachel. 
 I want you to ask that terrifying singer Eva... if she will sing at my party? 
 Ah! 
 Well, not such a small favour. 
 Ah! So, she scares you, too, does she? 
 I don't think she approved of me. 
 Hopefully, that's only temporary. 
 But she may agree to it if it comes from you. 
 A fellow musician. 
 Yeah, an amateur musician. 
 Will you do it? 
 [LOUD ORCHESTRAL MUSIC] 
 Mr Ferguson! 
 Mr Ferguson! 
 Mr Ferguson! 
 Mrs Tooley, I was so hoping you'd drop by. 
 The music is far too loud! Turn it off at once. 
 And this room is such a horrible mess. 
 And it gets worse every week. 
 A mess? 
 It's my collection, Mrs Tooley, that I've picked up from all over the place and I'm adding to it because I need to occupy my mind. 
 My little one, out for your walk, are you? 
 How good you look. 
 They won't let us out. So, she walks here. 
 We must have another one of our adventures soon, mustn't we? 
 I mean, a story. 
 Of course. Only that. 
 I will read to her. 
 [HE PLAYS A SOOTHING MELODY] 
 Oh, damn it. 
 So, you're a pianist, as well? 
 You sound a little bit out of practice to me. 
 Well, I don't remember inviting you. 
 When I want an audience, I'll let you know. 
 Just checking on your progress, Mr Ferguson. 
 Oh, when I've made any, I expect someone will remember to inform you. 
 They'd better. I hear you're just mollycoddling the German. 
 That's right. 
 Well, it's reassuring to see you so busy, anyway. 
 So thoroughly focused on the task. 
 It may surprise you, but there's not a moment goes by when I don't think about it. 
 And I'm confident I'll succeed. 
 And, of course, if I don't pull it off, you can have a try yourself. 
 The way you lot like to do things. 
 You can beat the sh1t out of him all you like. 
 You don't want to think about  not  succeeding, I promise you. 
 Then I won't. 
 Now, if you'll excuse me, there's a lady waiting for me downstairs. 
 Rather an attractive lady, as it happens. 
 Wainwright may be prepared to give you more time, but I'm not. 
 Oh, you have no idea how alarming I find that threat. 
 Mr Ferguson. Good evening. 
 Miss Griffiths. 
 Before I sit down, I have something to give you. 
 Here is the list. With all of the names checked and where we think some of them might be. 
 That is quick. 
 Yes, well, I did say that I would label it "very urgent". 
 This is useful. 
 Thank you. 
 Would you like to try one of these? 
 They're a new recipe. New this evening. 
 Certainly would. 
 Got yourself nicely settled in here, haven't you? 
 Absolutely. 
 Talking of which, are you really trying to tell me you don't have any more rooms in this place? 
 Or at least one big room where you're keeping your records? 
 I am really telling you that, yes. 
 I know it must drive you lot to distraction, me suddenly popping up all the time. 
 I hate having to do it this way. But time is so short. 
 And it's not just the trials in Nuremberg that are important. 
 Everyone thinks that's all that matters, but it's all the other people we need to find... we need to trace before their trails become invisible. 
 I do realise, Miss Griffiths, that time is very short. 
 Anyway... 
 I'm going to surprise you. 
 I'm going to stop lecturing you tonight, be a little less serious, because I can be like that, believe it or not. 
 Although, it's been quite a while. It may not be very convincing. 
 Why would you want to do that? 
 Be less serious? 
 Get your attention. 
 Naturally. Try a different approach. 
 Miss Griffiths, you have my attention. 
 In fact, you have all of my attention. 
 And I'm going to prove it to you. 
 I will have something for you, something else, in the next 24 hours or so that will mean us working together. 
 Working together? 
 You and me? 
 Yes. 
 Are you interested? 
 Of course I am. 
 Ah, you're discovering me about to make a complete pig of myself, Mr Ferguson. 
 You know, the food has suddenly exploded in this hotel. 
 You must have noticed. A few mistakes, of course. 
 Like serving corn on the cob, but these are a real surprise. 
 It must've been the Austrian cabbage that started it all. 
 Well, maybe. So, you've come without your ward tonight, Mr Lindsay-Jones? 
 Yes, tempted back by the ingenious food. 
 And I was hoping to see you. 
 You've come with some kind of a message for me, have you? 
 About getting results? I have no message, no. 
 But I do have something personal to ask you. 
 We don't know each other, Mr Ferguson, I realise that. 
 No, we certainly don't. 
 But, since you haven't denied being a member of T-Force... and are not denying it now, I want you to arrange for me to go to the military camp in Enfield, Altrincham Park. 
 I would have thought, for somebody like you, that would be easy. 
 You think I'm somehow connected with the Secret Service, Mr Ferguson? 
 No, no, no. 
 I'm afraid I don't have an exciting or mysterious job at all. 
 I'm merely a foreign office official a few months away from leaving the service. 
 That's all I want. To visit the camp. 
 Will you arrange it? Tomorrow? 
 Well, why do you want to go there? 
 It needs to be in the evening. 
 Please do this for me. 
 Right, so where in the camp do you want to go? 
 Please, just drive for the moment. 
 Now up to the house, please. 
 Now we wait, Mr Ferguson. 
 Until it's dark, before we go in. 
 Well, that could just be a good idea. 
 These ruins are used for combat training. 
 House-to-house fighting with live ammunition, I'm not sure they do it in the dark, so there might less chance of us getting shot. 
 You don't have to come with me, you know. 
 
 
 
 You didn't live here, by any chance, Mr Lindsay-Jones? 
 No, no, absolutely not. 
 Shall we go in? 
 You really don't need to come in if you don't feel it's safe, but I'm going to go in, unless you stop me, of course. 
 [Shouting]: Hello! 
 Is anybody here? 
 If we make enough noise, they ought to know that we're here and they won't use us for target practice. 
 You can make as much noise as you like, Mr Ferguson. 
 There's no danger of you waking the building. 
 No, I didn't live here. 
 I did come here a few times. 
 My wife knew the family. 
 Sir Henry Markham. 
 Last time I was here, it was... just three weeks before the outbreak of the war. 
 There was the most enormous ball... coming-out party for the daughter of the family. 
 It was really the most extraordinary occasion. 
 Everything was so lavish. 
 The fountains were all lit up in the garden. 
 There were flowers and decorations all along these walls, the King and Queen were here. 
 In fact, it took two hours to get along the drive because there were so many cars. 
 And my wife... 
 Isabel... 
 [IMAGINED CHATTER AND LAUGHTER] 
 My wife... she was wearing a particularly fetching dress that night. 
 She died less than a year later on one of the first bombing raids of the Blitz. 
 I wasn't with her. 
 I was working late at the Foreign Office. 
 It wasn't here that she died, but... for some reason, whenever I think of her... 
 I see her as she was that night. 
 [IMAGINED EXPLOSION] 
 Well, I'm sorry I made it sound so urgent about coming here, but I didn't want to lose contact with you in case you left the hotel. 
 You see, I've looked into who you are, Mr Ferguson, I've checked a few things about you- 
 Ah, I thought you had. 
 I know you worked for Mr Frank Whittle before the war, on his invention and development of the jet engine, and you saw it first-hand, the terrible obstacles and indifference that he encountered and what that led to. 
 I know you understand the cost of ministerial incompetence and official deceit. 
 Am I right, Mr Ferguson? 
 Oh, you could be. 
 Now, it is possible that I saw some things myself in the circles I move in, that could be of interest to you, Mr Ferguson. 
 I'm guessing, of course, that you'll be interested, but I know some things very few other people do. 
 About what really went on. 
 How we could have won the war before it had even started. 
 How none of this need have happened. 
 Stories about some of the highest people in the land and what they actually got away with. 
 What they did in secret. 
 I have to piece it all together still, find out a little more before I'm certain, and I might need your help. 
 Might you, Mr Lindsay-Jones. 
 I might. But if you are intrigued, or a little interested, or merely just curious, you must let me know. 
 Well, I'd be an idiot not to be curious, Mr Lindsay-Jones. 
 But at this moment, I have a very full schedule. 
 Especially, as it happens, tonight. 
 Always so busy. 
 Even tonight? 
 [FOREIGN RADIO PLAYS] 
 Who are you listening to? 
 Oh, it's you, sir. 
 I'd like to know who the hell you were listening to. 
 Oh, just one of the other people we're interested in, sir. 
 I didn't realise you were still listening to other people? 
 Yes, sir, I told you that on the first day, don't you remember? 
 It's just three other rooms, not nearly as important as Mr Koehler. 
 I didn't want to bother you with the details. 
 When's it going to happen, sir? 
 About three o'clock in the morning. 
 [FIRE CRACKLES] 
 [GUNS COCK] 
 [MEN SCREAM] 
 [KNOCKING ON DOOR] 
 Hello. 
 So extraordinary having to try to get to sleep next door to somebody who never sleeps. 
 I just came to see if I could do anything about that. 
 So, next door is your real room, then, is it? 
 My real room? Yes. 
 What are you waiting for tonight? 
 Well, who says that I'm waiting for anything? 
 Because you seem very tense. 
 It's that obvious, is it? 
 When is it going to happen, whatever it is? 
 In about an hour and a half. 
 Then we might just have time, mightn't we? 
 Don't look like that. 
 Lots of people would be pleased... thrilled, even. 
 What makes you think that I'm not? 
 Oh, come on, you should see your face. 
 You're such a snob. 
 You're thinking, "Am I going to have to pay her? 
 "Is that what she expects?" 
 But you know, I'm not really a tart at all. 
 That's what you think I am, isn't it? 
 No. You have far too posh a voice. 
 Oh, so you  are  a snob! 
 I didn't used to sound like this as a kid. 
 I had to change my voice to stand any chance of getting on as an actress. 
 I should be really furious that you think I am a tart. 
 Then why aren't you furious? 
 I don't know. 
 Maybe because we're both insomniacs. 
 It's not good to be so obsessed with work. 
 Not good at all. You're thinking, "She's got the room next door, "how am I ever going to get rid of her?" No. No, you don't know everything I'm thinking. And I'm certainly not thinking that. Good. Because I've got to stop you thinking so much. Yes. Especially about later tonight. Me having to take advice from those lunatics. Like that man, Salter... or whatever his name is. You start talking about that man I have got to stop that. [THEY GROAN] [BANGING] Wake up. Wake up! You're coming with us! Come on, wake up! Right now! Wake up! Come on! Both of you! Papi! Papi! Mr Koehler, please take a seat. I'm Kathy Griffiths. From the War Crimes Unit. War crimes? And you need to see me at three in the morning? Is that what you think is civilised? We are seeing you at this time of the night, yes. We want to examine your record, and whether there are any gaps or inconsistencies. I did all this in Germany already when I was interrogated by the people he works for. And now it starts again? Just because you can think of no other way of dealing with me. And for some extraordinary reasons, you find it necessary to bring my daughter here! In the middle of the night! Is she going to be interrogated, as well? Your daughter? Yes! Your daughter is here? That was clearly a mistake. [WATER DRIPS] Lotte should never have been brought with you. I agree with you, Mr Koehler, that is an unforgivable error. Can you both leave now? I will continue the rest of this interview on my own. Leave, Mr Ferguson. [DOOR BANGS SHUT] So, Mr Koehler, are you telling me you never worked, at any stage of the war, at the underground works at Mittelbau Nordhausen or at Peenemunde, where slave labour was used? You know I didn't. You can see that from all the files they've made about me. You shouldn't be here, Lotte. I'm really sorry. I was always working on jet engines. Never on the V-1 or the V-2. I'm not a rocket man. Everybody knows that. But this has nothing to do with it, does it? If you're determined, you can give anybody the history you want them to have. To suit your purpose. You're trying to give me a choice here, work for us or we're going to make you a war criminal. I thought you British were above such things. Mr Koehler, that is certainly not what I'm trying to do. And as it happens, I believe you. About your work. But just as important as that, it's clear that you should never have been brought here tonight, least of all with your daughter. Mr Koehler's going home now. What? You've finished already? I most certainly have. I've absolutely no more questions for Mr Koehler. And I've  definitely  none for his daughter. How dare you! How dare you use the unit like that, and what's more, you even bring the girl here? In the middle of the night. I can't believe you did that. She shouldn't have been here. I've already said that. You saw me, and you thought, "Why not let her loose on him for a bit? Make him realise, if he doesn't cooperate, he may have war crimes pinned on him." There is nothing in his file! You knew there was nothing there. But you dropped all those hints to me. "Oh, we know more about him than his records show. He may have connections with slave labour and people dying." But you knew all that wasn't true, didn't you? I had no evidence of that, no. You knew I'd probably leap at the chance to question a real live suspect, didn't you? Like an idiot, that's exactly what I did. Isn't it enough? You've got all these resources and we're just this... tin-pot little outfit! Running around having to beg for information! Having to plead to be shown people's records! I mean, isn't that enough? And then, you make sure it happens in the worst possible place. One of your old torture haunts you used during the war. I hate to think what happened here. You're probably still using it, aren't you? I never tortured anybody in my life. I don't have anything to do with those people! Well, you did tonight, didn't you? You were working with them. Because, somehow, I have to get that man cooperating with us. It is vital for our security. I'm sorry, Miss Griffiths, about tonight, I really am. And I know this won't make any difference, but this was not my idea. Clearly, it was not a good plan. You're bloody right, it doesn't make any difference. You've done nothing but lie to me ever since I met you. You want a lift? No, thank you. Went well in there, did it? I have a message for you. I bet you have. It's not what you're expecting. Brigadier Wainwright is going to give you another three weeks. Not what I'd be doing, of course, but for the moment, he's running the show. And out of the goodness of his heart, he's given you three more weeks. Tell him I don't need them. [KNOCK ON DOOR] [DOG BARKS] Ah, Mrs Tooley. I'm very early, I know. I do apologise. You're as bad as your brother. What could be so important you have to be here at this time? You might have brought me something, you know? You're quite right. I should have done. Next time. I'm flattered you came here for my advice. Well, advice might be putting it a bit high, don't you think? Well, you seek sanctuary here, anyway, amongst my collection. In Mrs Tooley's house. You always find a way, Cal. I'm sure you will. Ah, I'm just so... so angry at myself for being talked into such a ridiculous plan. Never again. Never do what you're told, you know I believe that more than anything. How have you been managing these last couple of days? Are you feeling OK? Improving, I think. I'm looking forward to seeing the specialist and telling him the truth as I see it. Oh! I'm so envious of you being at that hotel, Cal. What I really want to do is come and be there, too. It's the obvious thing. You must be able to get me a job there. A job at the Connington? I don't think that's a good idea, Victor. Please. Remember, I need to occupy my mind. Where better to do it? And it would be good for you, too. I can't get you a job there. Won't take the risk, eh? Oh! And now he wakes me up! All the ration books we could get hold of have gone into this breakfast. We even have sausages today. Well, it will take more than this breakfast to stop me thinking about last night! Well, I guessed that. So, how about this? You're free to go. What do you mean by that? You can go. Leave the hotel. You can go for a walk in the park, or along the river? Or maybe even visit the American or Russian embassies, see what they have to offer. Or, of course, you could jump on the boat train and go home... to Germany. There will be nobody following you at any time. And... here's some money. I don't believe you. It's not going to be as you say. Well, why don't you put it to the test and see? I've never known somebody to take such a risk about anything, sir. He'll come back. He'll be trying to work out where his best chance is. If he goes home to Germany, he has no job, no money. I didn't give him much. No, he'll be thinking, "How will we live?" But he's also thinking he could go to the Americans or the Russians. And I'm betting everything on him wanting to continue his work. And thinking that he can do that with me. And want to stay with the devil he knows. God, I hope you're right, sir. Can't we just put one tail on him, sir? It's all or nothing, Ringwood. I'm tense already. How are you going to spend the time? By doing something even more nerve-wracking. I just thought I'd see if I could steal an orange. There are only two left. So give me a good reason why one of them should go to you. I couldn't possibly. Well, they're locked up where nobody can get at them. So, you'll have to wait a while till I finish this. No, no, thanks. Never seen somebody so jumpy peeling an orange. [SHE SCOFFS] What do you really want, Mr Ferguson? Oh, it's that obvious I've come for something else, is it? Yes. And since I'm pretty sure you're some sort of spy, maybe you shouldn't be that obvious. Right. Well, I... have been asked to ask you if... That is not a good beginning. No, you're right. Remember when you first played here, the other night? There was a well-dressed woman who danced a lot? Well, she is married to a close friend of mine, and she's just arrived in town and... she would like you to play at her party. She's having a party? Just arrived here and she's having a party? [SHE SCOFFS] But of course. What else is there to do? Why don't you like her? She hasn't really spoken to me, so how can I like her? But maybe she's one of those people who treats you like a gramophone. A machine over in the corner, wants to turn you over and play you. They don't even see you. She's not like that. [CHILDREN PLAY OUTSIDE] Oh, God. So, will you do it? Maybe. But I'm not sure the night will go that well, though. Why do you say that? Because I have to keep my mouth shut. And I'm not very good at doing that, as you may have noticed. Back home, I got into trouble. A lot of trouble. I lost bookings because I wouldn't play certain audiences, segregated audiences. I said, "Hire somebody else if you want that." [SHE CHUCKLES] And they did. And that's why I'm in this basement here, now. Your basement, Mr Ferguson. [RUNNING FOOTSTEPS] What is it? You're wanted in the lobby, sir. This is the wrong moment, I can see that. I'm sorry. No, no, no. Absolutely not. No, no, it's fine. It looks like you're expecting somebody else. No, it's not that. In fact, I was literally, at this moment, in the middle of asking Eva to play at your party. Were you really? Well, then, it is truly bad timing on my part. Unless she said yes, of course. I think she said yes... I just wanted your advice. I was passing, and I thought, "Why not pop in and see if he's here?" Advice about what? Well, it will seem very trivial, especially as you've been kind enough to ask the singer for me, but I was just ordering the catering for the party which fast approaches, and I had this totally mad idea of hiring the chef from here to do it. And then I realised that you were the only person I could ask if that was a ludicrous notion. Seems like a bold idea to me. Bold, is it? I'm not sure that I want to be bold at my first party here. What if it went terribly wrong? I can see that you need to go. I'm so sorry. I just had to check on something. It's amazing, sir. You were right. Well, maybe. Of course, we don't know where they've been, or what he's planning yet. It's what he does next that matters. I'd like some paper, please. Would that be one or two sheets, sir? That is as much paper as you can possibly give me. [KNOCK AT DOOR] To quote Greta Garbo not quite correctly, I want very much to be alone right now, for a while. And then we might talk. [CAMERA CLICKS] [DOOR KNOCKS] Yep. Everything is under control, sir. He's buried in his work. Good, the more he works the better. It's been like that for days, hasn't it, sir? You still don't want any watchers in the passage? No, no. Absolutely none. He won't be going anywhere tonight. I want to see my brother, please. Your brother? And who might that be, sir? Cal. Mr Callum Ferguson, I think he's virtually running the hotel at the moment. Mr Ferguson is not currently here, sir. Is that the truth? That is the truth. Why would it not be, sir? He had an engagement this evening. Not a very happy lot, are they? Haven't seen some of these people for so long. Hopefully the music will help turn them back into friends. I'm so glad you made her have this party. She's got so much to offer. I don't think it was me that made a difference. I hear you met Harold Lindsay-Jones. I did, yes. He's an interesting man. A little mysterious. Ah, this could be interesting. [THEY PLAY JAZZ] ♪ Bye-bye, choo-choo baby ♪

I have to work. Something to entertain her, it's a good idea. [MUSIC CONTINUES] So, the music is your doing, I gather? I encouraged her to be here. Have you thought about what I said to you the other day? I have, yes. In fact, I've found it quite difficult to get it out of my mind... which I'm sure is what you intended. Want to hear more? Of course, Mr Lindsay-Jones. Although it's not quite clear to me what it is you want me to do... other than listen to your stories. Classified stories, of course. It might be a sensible way for us to get to know each other. And to see if we can trust each other. [MUSIC STOPS] [MUTED APPLAUSE] Huh! She helps herself. You can tell the socialists have really taken over, can't you? And not before time! That went down really well, didn't it? Since this is a party, I promised Mr Ferguson over there, that I wouldn't start an argument. Well, OK! Let's have a party. I really don't want you to waste your time, sir. Thank you, then, I won't. I need to see him so badly, I'll go look for him. Sir... I say! Careful there, young man! So, my little one, we must have a story in a moment. We have lost so much. So much that was precious. Excuse me? Are you a resident of the hotel? Are you talking to me? I most certainly am. Then I will talk to you. If you're not a guest of the hotel, you've no business being up here. No business? Except perhaps to say that I see a lovely eyeball here. And during the war, I popped some eyeballs out just like this. Oh! Good God! My little one, what is the matter? We will just... have a story. One moment, please. I must go to the lavatory. You will come back... won't you? Papi? Yes, Lotte. [HE SPEAKS GERMAN] Ah! Somebody who looks intelligent at last! Now, where are you off to? If it's all right to ask. Please, not go back. I don't want to go back to my room. Well, that makes two of us. Let's see if we can find some late-night chocolate instead. ♪ Was it my fault? ♪

That's what I think he would have provided. I should have taken your advice... been bold. Well, you were bold enough to have Eva here, weren't you? Besides, there's always a next time. You think there'll be a next time?! Not judging by all those long faces next door. You don't mind what people think of you, do you? No, I stopped worrying about that on the first day of the war. And I haven't started again. Well, not yet. You're very lucky. Would we could all be like that. What, and you're not? No! I worry what people think. Far too much. Especially, I find, now I'm here. There's so much I want to do, you know, get involved with things that interest me, help them happen, things that are far more important than a good party. Of course. I'll have to tell you about them. We should meet properly. We haven't done that yet. You, me and Alex. [KNOCK ON DOOR] There's a telephone call for Mr Ferguson? Even here, Cal?! It's very urgent, they say. I assure you, the police will be here any moment. Where are they? Where are they? What are they waiting for? My daughter is gone! Lotte has vanished! She can't have gone far. They say this madman was in the hotel, and he has taken my daughter and that man was your brother. My... my brother? Yes! He can't have been here! He was here. They say he was acting crazily. Your brother has taken my daughter! He won't hurt her, all right? He can't hurt her, he wouldn't do that. How do you know that?! You don't know that! I promise you, I will find her. I will find both of them. I will get her back. Come on. We'll find the only hot chocolate left in England. We may have to travel far, many miles. But we will discover it. No-one is going to stop us. Or find us.
