 Halt. 
 [HE SPEAKS GERMAN] 
 We were given no warning. We were given only five minutes to pack... 
 What did he say to you? 
 What did your father say to you? 
 I don't speak English. 
 Not one of my questions have been answered! 
 Not one! I've said what I think at each interrogation. 
 I make my position clear again and again. 
 However many times you ask me, I'm not going to change anything. It makes no difference at all. 
 This way. 
 [HE SPEAKS OWN LANGUAGE] 
 Tell me its name. 
 My name is Mr Emmanuel. 
 Do you understand me now? 
 You're still not going to talk to me? 
 That is not very polite. 
 But then I understand. 
 Some things, they must never be lost. 
 You didn't thank me. 
 Thank you. 
 Goodbye, little one. 
 [HE SHOUTS IN GERMAN] 
 [ENGINES ROAR NEARBY] 
 There's no need to be afraid. 
 I've just come to take you to breakfast. 
 [HE SPEAKS BROKEN GERMAN] 
 You must be starving. 
 My German's not very good, I know. 
 But I think you understand English. 
 Don't you? 
 A little, anyway. 
 Prison. 
 No... you're not in prison. 
 There were a lot of rations went on to that plane. 
 If you eat one of those, I'll tell you where we are. 
 Well, I'll tell you anyway. 
 You're in London. 
 Well, you're on the edge of London in Enfield, to be exact. 
 If these are the centre of London... well, then we're here, north, and your father, in case you were worrying, will join you in a couple of hours. 
 [HE ATTEMPTS TO TRANSLATE INTO GERMAN] 
 Brigadier wants to see you, sir. 
 Right. Now, enjoy your breakfast. 
 Blimey! 
 It's time we got out of here, gave Enfield back to them. 
 Burning stuff already? 
 We've got to start getting rid of some of it. 
 We're drowning in files. 
 I thought you of all people would be glad to see the back of it, having had to spend so much time reading the bloody stuff. 
 And if we missed something interesting? 
 Too bad. 
 So, you've seen the little girl? 
 Yes. I've done your baby-sitting for you. 
 Good. I know you're meant to be going on leave this week and it's very overdue, so this is not an order, but I want you to do a little more baby-sitting of a rather more important kind instead. 
 And who do you want me to babysit? 
 The father. 
 And the little girl, of course. 
 He could be very important to us. 
 He's a scientist or an engineer. 
 I never know what the correct term is when you're talking about high speed. 
 A jet-plane man anyway. 
 Brilliant, apparently. 
 Speaks quite good English shouldn't be difficult. 
 What's the problem? 
 He doesn't want to work with us. 
 We had to move fast before the Russians got him. 
 They've grabbed nearly 1,000 scientists so far, and the Americans are grabbing them and so are we. 
 We snatched him out of bed in the middle of the night, in fact. 
 Though I'm sure we did it in as civilised a way as possible. 
 Oh, of course. 
 But he's a little bit irritated with us nonetheless, maintains he won't co-operate with us under any circumstances. 
 You've got to make him change his mind. 
 I'm getting demobbed in six weeks, which I'm sure you haven't forgotten. 
 And that is definitely going to happen, sir. 
 This will only take six days. 
 If I were to do it... it'll be under one condition. 
 Of course, but you don't know where you're going to be doing it yet, do you? 
 We're using the Connington Hotel. 
 It's a funny old dump, but with some surprisingly good perks. 
 I want you to take this German and get him wining and dining, and anything else he shows a real liking for, and completely turn him around using the hotel. 
 In six days? 
 The morons from MI19 are eager to get their hands on him and give him their full treatment, as if shining lights in his eyes and not letting him get any sleep is going to make him like us. 
 I've told them they can't have him for a few days. Six. 
 I imagine your condition is you want to run it exactly how you like. 
 Yes. 
 With nobody breathing down my neck, not from MI5 or... 
 Or any other bloody outfit, naturally. 
 So, when do I start? 
 Four o'clock this afternoon, back entrance to the hotel. 
 Chap called Ringwood. Oh, and we don't use uniforms in the hotel, so you'll have to get out of that. 
 Only one thing matters. 
 Get him to work for us... 
 ... doesn't matter how I do it. 
 That too, of course. 
 But, most of all, don't lose them, or let them slip away to the Russians or the Americans. 
 I can get you much closer round the front, sir. 
 No, no, this is fine. This is the entrance that I need. Thank you. 
 Where on earth did you get that? 
 Those must be the only toffee apples in London. 
 Pow! 
 There are all sorts staying here, sir, yes. 
 Because it is quite cheap. But they don't all look like that. 
 Hello, sir. You must be Captain Ferguson, or at least I hope you are. 
 I was given a very loose description. 
 Yes, you must be Ringwood. 
 Indeed, that's me, sir. 
 Do you want me to call somebody to help you with your luggage? 
 I hardly think that's necessary. 
 Yes. It's all bit gloomy down here. 
 Because of the bomb site, they keep these boarded up. 
 Very different upstairs, though. 
 The dust doesn't reach there. 
 Quite a difference, isn't it? 
 Every building is gone on this side, so it's bloody bright. 
 Oh, this sun. Reminds me of the Riviera sometimes. 
 Yes. 
 Not the only thing that reminds one of the Riviera round here, sir. 
 It's a funny old mausoleum this place, but it does have its compensations. 
 Now, if I can find the right key, this is your bedroom, 246. 
 Your office is directly across the way here, sir. 
 [LADIES GIGGLE] 
 Except of course it is not your office, really, sir. 
 You're going to have to explain that one to me, Ringwood. 
 So, you see, this is our real operation. 
 The other office is just for show for anybody who's pestering us. 
 We let them look at that one. 
 Who are these people that are pestering you? 
 Somebody from the War Crimes Unit just poking around, but hopefully we've got rid of them, fingers crossed. 
 They've got rather different priorities to us, haven't they, sir? 
 It's our secret floor. 
 I think I can safely say nobody in the hotel knows about it, except for the two or three that have to know, of course, and the cleaners too, naturally. 
 But they are completely reliable. 
 And we have the capacity to listen to several rooms we've parked people we're interested in. 
 We can monitor who they're talking to, what they're saying, what they're thinking. 
 Yes, we did a lot of that at Enfield, at Trent Park. 
 Yes. 
 A captured German officer. 
 The old methods are usually the best, aren't they, sir? 
 You've got a hell of a lot of files. 
 They dumped a lot of stuff on us, a load of interviews from Germany. 
 Well, has anybody read them? 
 Good question. 
 Not quite sure about that, sir. 
 Here are your people, sir, if you want to have a listen. 
 [THEY SPEAK GERMAN] 
 He's very important, is he, sir? 
 Yes. He's a jet-plane man. 
 Whoever gets the best jet engine, Ringwood, wins whatever's going to happen next. 
 So, we have to make sure he designs it for us. 
 Not the Americans or the Russians, but us. 
 [KNOCKS ON DOOR] 
 Yes. 
 Ah, hello. 
 I'm Callum Ferguson, this is Mr Ringwood. 
 Could we come in for a moment? 
 So, you are our jailers, are you? 
 Well, I hope that's not going to happen, for both of our sakes. 
 It's not too bad in here, is it? 
 Ah, well, at least it's clean. 
 No smell of damp. 
 No springs sticking up through the mattress. 
 Not on a first feel anyway. 
 And hello again. 
 Tell me, did you manage to eat one of those sausages? 
 Was there something particular you wanted to say to me? 
 Yes, as it happens. 
 I was hoping you both might have dinner with me tonight. 
 No, I don't think so. 
 No? 
 No. Apart from everything, we have nothing to wear. 
 I'm sure they don't all dress for dinner at this old place, do they, Ringwood? 
 Not all of them, no. 
 My daughter has only one change of dress. 
 How is she expected to manage? 
 Well, we can't have that, can we? 
 Now, Mr Ringwood will go shopping for you very soon. 
 Won't he? 
 [PHONE RINGS] 
 Sir. 
 She's here again. 
 Bloody woman from the War Crimes Unit. 
 Brigadier Wainwright. 
 Remember me? 
 I certainly do, Miss Griffiths. 
 I've sent you rather a lot of messages, so I thought... 
 You would try and snatch a quick word with me. 
 Exactly. 
 Well, jump in, Miss Griffiths. 
 This is perfect timing for a very quick word. 
 I've got an appointment down at the camp which I'm a trifle late for. 
 I see you're getting rid of some paperwork. 
 Oh, that's nothing. It's just a little housekeeping. 
 A few bills from the canteen. 
 I always try and drive myself, Miss Griffiths, then I've only got myself to blame for anything that happens. 
 We sent you some names. 
 Some names. A lot of names. 
 Did you, indeed? 
 Here we are. I'm sorry, but I have a meeting waiting for me now. 
 You must send me your list again, Miss Griffiths. 
 I'm afraid I don't recall getting it. Been a pleasure. 
 Sir. 
 I know you're dealing with all sorts of people who are of interest to you not just scientists and engineers, but German agents who know a lot about the Russians and you need their co-operation. 
 I do realise that, sir I'm glad to hear that, Miss Griffiths. 
 Nobody in the War Crimes Unit wants to get in the way of that, sir, or make things more difficult. 
 But you may be bringing people over here who did things during the war that they need to answer for, who are on the list. 
 You have your job to do, Miss Griffiths, I understand. 
 Good. Thank you, sir. 
 But our job concerns matters of national security. 
 Getting the information we need to protect this country, that is our number one priority. 
 Now, if you'll excuse me. 
 One other thing. 
 Excuse me, sir. 
 But with all the resources you've got, all those files you've compiled, you may have information on certain other names who are of interest to us, who are still at large, and maybe those files can help us track them down. 
 That couldn't be clearer, Miss Griffiths. 
 What I suggest you do is this... send me the list again and we will do our best to be of help. 
 Blimey. Not exactly buzzing in here, is it? 
 [GENTLE STRING MUSIC PLAYS] 
 Well, Mr Ringwood is clearly enjoying his. 
 Are you sure you don't want to see if it tastes better than it looks? 
 You must understand the shock of suddenly being seized in one's home and brought here doesn't make one hungry. 
 You know what happened? 
 People screaming at us, guns pointed at our faces. 
 The British were picking up, as they put it, "anybody they thought might be useful". 
 Not just scientists, absolutely everybody. 
 Even an old couple who had worked for a drinks company, and you thought they might have the secret formula of the spicy alcoholic drink that's very popular. 
 Well, that was clearly a mistake. 
 The old couple and the spicy drink. 
 No, no, no. You're seizing everybody who can give you an advantage. 
 Well, for the moment, that's necessary in the present circumstances. 
 Then there is this food here. 
 It's not at all bad. 
 This cabbage looks most strange. 
 She loves how her mother used to cook cabbage, with garlic and onions and butter. 
 And, when she died, when my wife died, our cook always cooked the cabbage like that. 
 So you realise my daughter and I won't be eating. 
 [HE CLICKS FINGERS] 
 Excuse me. 
 Yes. 
 We would like some more cabbage, please. 
 But, this time, cooked with onions and garlic and butter. 
 We can't do that, sir, not cabbage with onions. 
 You can't do cabbage with onions? 
 You have an orchestra, if one could call them that, which allows you to charge more than the permitted five shillings per head. 
 So, is it too much to ask for this cabbage? 
 It is, sir, yes. 
 And what about a plate of onions? 
 Just a plate of onions on the side. 
 Then I could mush the onions into the cabbage. 
 Would that be possible? 
 That would not be possible, no, sir. 
 Are you sure about that? 
 I am sure about this, yes, sir. 
 Um, what are you doing in here? 
 Whoever you are, you cannot come in here. 
 Would it be possible to cook a portion of cabbage with garlic, butter and onion? 
 You mean Austrian cabbage? 
 It'll be extremely helpful to me at this particular moment if you could cook me a plateful of Austrian cabbage. 
 Who's this for? 
 Extraordinary-looking cabbage. 
 A lot of butter rations went into that. 
 I will need to know whose room. 
 Just put everything on my room. 
 WOMAN NEARBY: She's really enjoying it. 
 Excuse me. 
 That smells absolutely delightful. 
 What do I have to do to get some too? 
 I think that might be round one to us. Don't you think, sir? 
 No, I'm not sure about that. 
 Put them to bed, Ringwood. 
 Make sure there's somebody outside their door at all times. 
 [DRUMS BANGING NEARBY] 
 Can we help you? 
 No, no, no. I just heard a noise. 
 Some drumming. 
 Well, you may be right, it may be just noise. 
 You coming to the opening? 
 The... the opening? 
 Well, they're doing a great job advertising it if people in the hotel don't even know about it. 
 I can see we can really look forward to it heaving down here on Thursday. 
 Standing room only. 
 I'm sorry, I've only just arrived. 
 So this was the basement bar, was it? 
 Basement ballroom. 
 It's been closed since the middle of the war. 
 We've been hired for the grand opening. 
 But don't feel the need to come we can manage without you. 
 Not even heard about it in the hotel. 
 Well, I will definitely be there, I can assure you. 
 You will, will you? 
 Well, you know it's a funny thing about this hotel, isn't it? 
 I hear the Army's using it. 
 Is that you? 
 Oh... don't worry. 
 I won't tell anybody. 
 [DRUMMING RESUMES] 
 You want to join them up there? 
 Me? 
 No, no, no. 
 No, I play a little piano. 
 You any good? 
 No, not at the moment. 
 A little out of practice. 
 You want us to be the judge of that? 
 Definitely not, no. 
 All right. All right, come on. Come on, come on. 
 [DRUMMING CONTINUES] 
 That cabbage smelt absolutely delicious, if you don't mind my saying so. 
 It was delicious. I had a taste. 
 I am jealous. 
 I failed to get any. 
 Next time I might try storming the kitchen myself. 
 [DRUMMING CONTINUES] 
 Well, I recommend it, yes. It works. 
 Then I may definitely try it, if I ever come back here, which is quite possible. 
 You hear that drumming? 
 I do. 
 Funny, isn't it? 
 That going on in the basement. 
 Used to be quite a lively spot before the war, down there. 
 The Basement Ballroom. 
 If you'll excuse me, sir, I have to go. 
 Of course, forgive me, I merely wanted to congratulate you on the cabbage and your triumph over the maitre d'. 
 So, are they all safely tucked up in bed now? 
 They are, sir. 
 We have two people in the passage outside their door all night. 
 What about up here? 
 Is there someone up here at all times, listening in? 
 That would be me. 
 Right. 
 So, if you can give me the file you have on him, I'll take it. 
 And while you're at it, I'll take some more files, too. 
 Somebody ought to take a look at them before we get rid of them. 
 Keep me occupied tonight. 
 Tonight, sir? It is rather late. 
 Yes, but I don't always need to sleep. Come on. 
 [PHONE RINGS] 
 Why is somebody calling now? 
 Yes, hello. 
 Yes. 
 It's for you, sir They're putting through a call that was made to your bedroom. A Mr Alex Lombard? 
 I thought this place was supposed to be secret. 
 Seems the whole hotel knows. 
 Hello? Cal, there you are. 
 What on earth are you doing, cancelling dinner with us tomorrow? I thought... 
 Things changed, unfortunately. 
 It's only for a few days, Alex. 
 There's just something I have to do. 
 But it can't wait for a few days! 
 I so want you to meet her! 
 Alex, we haven't seen each other in years. 
 I'm dying to meet her too. Of course I am. 
 No, it definitely can't wait. 
 [LITTLE GIRL CRYING] 
 We'll meet for elevenses tomorrow. 
 That's what we should do. 
 I'm sure you can get away for that. 
 At Fuller's in Bloomsbury Square at 11:30. 
 Cal, did you hear me? 
 Yeah, no, I'll be there. 
 Alex, I have to go, I'm sorry. 
 What is it? 
 Think you better hear this, sir. 
 [THE CRYING INTENSIFIES] 
 She's yelling that she wants to go home. 
 [KNOCKS ON DOOR] 
 I thought maybe you weren't coming. 
 [MOANING AND GRUNTING NEARBY] 
 [MOANING CONTINUES] 
 [PANS CLATTER] 
 Sorry. 
 No, no, it's all right. 
 Doesn't look like I woke you, though. 
 No, you didn't. 
 Can't sleep? 
 Working. 
 You're about to say, "That makes two of us." 
 [CHUCKLING] No. I wasn't. 
 Of course not didn't enter your mind. 
 I really wasn't going to say that. 
 Well, thank you. 
 I'm afraid, sir, I can't get them in to breakfast, sir. 
 I've been trying for well over an hour. 
 They seem absolutely to be on hunger strike again, sir. 
 Right. 
 Good morning, you two. 
 You don't like the breakfast here, I see. 
 We wish to return to our rooms now. 
 In a minute, of course. 
 But I think I know where I can find something you  will  eat. 
 Come on, it's this way. 
 This is a little bit of a guess, but I believe you have some toffee apples for sale. 
 We'll pay a very good price for them. 
 The only hot toffee around. 
 And it's right on our doorstep. Isn't that a bit of luck, hmm? 
 She'll have one, but only one. 
 You seem to think the way to get me working for you is through my daughter's stomach. 
 You can take care of it from here, Ringwood. 
 I should go in there. 
 It's well worth a visit. 
 Thanks for the advice. 
 Well, maybe that's why you're here. 
 Not exactly. 
 I came to visit the hotel. 
 Then I saw you. You from T-Force? 
 And who are you? 
 Sorry. 
 I'm Kathy Griffiths from the War Crimes Unit. 
 You haven't answered my question. 
 Look, we know T-Force is using the hotel to "entertain" people of interest, so I just thought you might be from T-Force. 
 If you're not, of course, I've just given you a rather interesting piece of information. 
 And if I am? 
 Then I would ask you... very politely, if you could be of any help to me getting into your records. Somehow. 
 I've been to Enfield, of course, several times. 
 And they've been very slow. 
 Exactly. 
 Miss Griffiths, I'm so sorry, I have an appointment in a few minutes which I really do have to keep. 
 Yes. Same old story. 
 You really are from T-Force. 
 No, I really do have an urgent appointment. 
 See, my oldest friend is home from Washington. 
 He's brought back a wife with him and he wants me to meet her. 
 So, you see, I have to go. I can't miss that. 
 I'll give you this, I never heard that excuse from Brigadier Wainwright. 
 Come back to the hotel at four o'clock tomorrow. 
 We can have a meeting. 
 A meeting? 
 Yes, a meeting. 
 
 
 
 We're here. 
 Cal! 
 There you are. 
 How good to see you. 
 You're back at last, Alex! 
 I thought you were never coming. 
 I'm terribly sorry I'm late. 
 And this is Rachel. 
 Delighted to meet you. 
 And so am I to meet you. 
 I've been really impatient for this moment. 
 Oh, have you? 
 I keep on mentioning my friend Cal. 
 Oh, then I'm really sorry I'm so late. 
 Well, we were too, so it's perfect, isn't it? 
 Isn't it? 
 Well, unfortunately, I can't stay. 
 I just came to tell you that. 
 You came to say that you can't stay? 
 I have something rather important to attend to that I can't... 
 You haven't changed, Cal. 
 He hasn't changed a bit. 
 I can assure you that I have. 
 This is really embarrassing that I had to come and say hello and goodbye like this, but I got delayed coming here and I have to get back... 
 You're spending so long making excuses, you might as well sit down with us while you make them. 
 Come on. Tell us why you can't stay. 
 And besides, I have promised myself an English ice cream. 
 I've told her that's not a good idea at all. 
 Yes, Alex says, even before the war, it was the worst ice cream in the world. 
 Come on, you've got to stay and watch me taste one. 
 See what happens. 
 It is a very strange colour. 
 We may well be endangering our health. 
 No good can come of this at all. Cal is eating his. 
 I'll eat pretty much anything. 
 So what is this really serious work you're doing that means that you can't stay? 
 Even though you have in fact stayed quite a few minutes now. 
 Yes, I have to go, you're absolutely right. 
 No, no, I didn't mean it. 
 Please, stay a moment longer. 
 Tell me about your work. 
 Well, yesterday I was given a rather unexpected assignment. 
 An assignment. How exciting. Is it secret or can you tell us? 
 No, it's not particularly secret. 
 It's got to be a bit hush-hush. 
 Cal is in military intelligence. 
 He rounds up people who might be of help to us. 
 So you are in the Secret Service? 
 Oh, no, no, no, no. 
 We look down on them, of course. 
 And it's not for much longer. I'm about to get out. 
 I can't wait, in fact. 
 I'm not surprised. Cal had the most extraordinary war. 
 While I was sitting comfortably in Washington, he saw a lot of action and he did intelligence. 
 He is both boffin and soldier. 
 So you're a war hero, are you? 
 I certainly am not. 
 So what about this secret assignment that isn't really secret? 
 I'm looking after a German scientist who could be of great use. 
 I'm trying to make him... happier. 
 And have you made him happier? 
 Not quite yet, no. 
 Funnily enough, it all seems to be about food at the moment. 
 But of course. Food is the most important thing of all, bar nothing. 
 It's the greatest pleasure by miles. 
 Not sure that applies at the Connington Hotel, though. 
 Spooky old place. 
 It's difficult to get good food anywhere in town at the moment, but at the Connington? 
 Ah, well, I'm working on that. 
 It's a strange place, though, you're right. 
 As it happens, there's the grand reopening of the Basement Ballroom tomorrow night. 
 Although no-one seems to know about it. 
 Then we must come. 
 Well, we must. 
 Really, darling? I think we have an engagement tomorrow night. 
 Then we'll change it. 
 I hardly think it'll be worth it. 
 Well, it sounds very intriguing to me. 
 And we can see how you've got on with your assignment, see if you've triumphed yet. 
 [SHE SOBS LOUDLY] 
 [HARP PLAYS GENTLE MELODY] 
 [HE SPEAKS GERMAN] 
 Where have you been, sir? 
 I got unexpectedly delayed. 
 You've been able to manage, haven't you, Ringwood? 
 No, sir. 
 I've tried to make her sit still but she's a very unhappy child who wants to go home. 
 So you thought you'd let her behave like a toddler instead? 
 How would you behave if you were her?! 
 Would you be sitting quietly as if everything was normal?! 
 Yes, look, you've got everybody looking at you now, haven't you, Lotte? 
 [LOUD SOBBING CONTINUES] 
 Now... you see that man over there? 
 Do you see him? Yes, well, he's watching us, isn't he? 
 And maybe, just as I'm here to keep an eye on you, he's here to keep an eye on me. 
 What do you think? 
 That would be interesting, wouldn't it? 
 If that was what he was doing. 
 Hello again. 
 I just don't seem to be able to keep away, do I? 
 This is my ward, Lucy. 
 Ah, hello. I'm Callum Ferguson. 
 How do you do? 
 I just thought we should be properly introduced. 
 Absolutely. How rude of me. 
 Harold Lindsay-Jones. We met last night over some cabbage. 
 She's quite right, your friend, the little girl. 
 This music should not be endured in silence. 
 She's quietened down a bit now, I hope. 
 My apologies for any disturbance. 
 Yes. 
 Yesterday she was a little angel in that coat that was too big for her. 
 One night in this hotel and look what happens. 
 Miss Griffiths, could you come up here? 
 You do realise we're losing two more of them next week. 
 Two people are going? 
 I thought it was only one. 
 No, two. 
 And they want to move us into a smaller office, but I'm resisting that because it's a particularly horrible room. 
 I just wanted you to know, we probably don't have much time before they start winding us down. 
 Yes, Ms Clarkson, I know time is short. 
 Have you had any luck with T-Force? 
 Or any of them in fact? 
 Not in Enfield. Not yet. 
 They're under their own pressure to come up with results there. 
 They don't consider us a priority. 
 I do have a lead at the Connington. 
 There's somebody new there from T-Force. 
 It would be interesting to know, once and for all, how much information they've got stored there. 
 Yes, I fully expect to find that out. 
 [SCREAMING AND CRYING] 
 I think that... 
 Shhhh. 
 We can't just let this go on without doing something, sir, surely. 
 This is awful, sir, listening to this. 
 Yes, I'm listening to it. 
 It certainly is. Maybe we should call a doctor, get him to give her something. 
 No doctor. We don't need a doctor. 
 So these wardens told you what was happening, did they? 
 They did. 
 This cannot go on. My daughter cannot stay here. 
 As you can see, she has to go back to Germany. 
 This is the only thing that can be done! 
 Let me go home! 
 Please! 
 Please, let me go home! 
 So what are you going to do about it? 
 I want to go home! 
 I'm not sure yet. 
 I want to go home! 
 All I know is that I'm not having the greatest success giving you the time of your life here. 
 I want to go home! 
 All right, Lotte, go over there! 
 Get over there! 
 Now I'm going to show you something that maybe you didn't know was here. 
 One less listening device. 
 Now, we're going to get rid of every single one. 
 Are you going to help me? 
 I'm going to dig out every single one. 
 Ah. Just as I thought. 
 Here's another one. 
 And another one! Amazing, isn't it? 
 Another one here, surprisingly. 
 But yes. 
 Oh, come on. I'm sure there'll be a big one behind here, aren't you? 
 Right, let's see... 
 Ah-ha! 
 Now, look at that. 
 Just as I thought. A nice big one. 
 Now what do we do? 
 I expect you think the sound of one city's much like another. 
 What you don't realise is, even for me, being here after all that has happened is terrifying. 
 The sound of a strange city at night... you don't know what's coming for you. 
 And the sounds of this hotel too. 
 It gives one nightmares. 
 I will not work for you. 
 I will not work for the British Government. 
 You know, I was going to leave all of this until at least we had a chance to get to know each other. 
 But you must realise that there is nothing I won't do to make you co-operate. 
 Now, you may think that this is just another job for me. 
 No, I have my own personal reasons for being here. 
 Because of the war, obviously. 
 No, not in the way that you might think. 
 You see, I'm an engineer. 
 Like yourself. 
 And I worked for some brilliant people before the war. 
 All sorts of things happened. 
 Wonderful work was wasted which would have made us so much more powerful. 
 We should never have been so badly equipped when the war broke out. 
 It's not going to happen again. 
 So, when you're ready to talk, I will tell you everything that happened, the enormous mistakes that were made. 
 So, you see, there is nothing I won't do to make this work. 
 Nothing. 
 Including this. 
 [AUDIO CUTS OUT RADIO STATIC] 
 Well, now we really are alone. 
 So what's it been today? Can't sleep? 
 Or have you been having fun? 
 Little bit of work. 
 Working again? 
 You've done away with the need for sleep, have you? 
 Maybe for the moment. 
 No sleep at all? 
 It's a little bit exhausting even just standing next to you. 
 You wouldn't have thought there'd be anything left for them to find. 
 Maybe as they dig through all the rubble they find new layers. 
 [GUN COCKS] 
 Here already, sir. 
 I am. 
 But I'm about to leave you in charge again. 
 I have one other appointment to attend to. 
 I won't be long. 
 They shouldn't be too much trouble today, and here are some clothing coupons. 
 Get Lotte a new dress. 
 Right. Sir... what on earth was last night about? 
 Trying to get a result. 
 That's what. 
 Where are you going? 
 What did you say? 
 I said, "Where are you going?" 
 I'm sorry, do we know each other? 
 We do. Or at least I know you. 
 Even though I'm quite sure we've never met. 
 Brigadier Wainwright wants to know how you're getting on. 
 Well, if he does, then I'll let him know. 
 Personally. 
 Now, if you'll excuse me, I have an urgent appointment. 
 Going to see a woman, are you? 
 Is that why you're leaving the hotel? 
 No, as it happens, I'm going to go and see my brother. 
 Oh, your brother. 
 And that's urgent, is it? 
 Yes. You see, I can't be late. 
 He tends to get a little wound up if I'm late. 
 You know, it isn't anybody at T-Force you have to worry about, it's me. 
 I didn't want you put on this, even for a few days, because you think you can make up the rules, don't you? 
 And now you're not even listening to me. 
 Not very closely, no. 
 You don't want to lose them, I promise you. 
 You really don't want to find you've lost them. 
 Masses of money, you see? Masses. 
 I don't know what you've been worried about. 
 This is good for two more rounds at least. 
 And my brother's coming any moment he'll top me up. 
 I will be overflowing... 
 ... Thompson Street. 
 Union of British Free Men! 
 Come to tonight's meeting, seven o'clock! 
 Meeting tonight. Come and hear all about it! 
 Can you believe that? 
 Look at the lumbering bastards. Blackshirts. 
 They're crawling back already. 
 Some of them even still call themselves Blackshirts as if the war had never happened. 
 Meeting tonight. Come and hear Raymond Thomson speak. 
 Get out of here, you fuckers! 
 Just go away or I'll kill you all! 
 Just keep on going! 
 Come on, go! Keep going! 
 Cal! They are lucky. 
 They are very lucky that I'm not in the mood for action. 
 What are you doing? 
 What is all this noise? I'm only a few minutes late. 
 And I'm lighting up the street already. 
 You b*st*rd, I thought you weren't coming. 
 Well I hope you're not going to make me wish that I hadn't. 
 Of course not. 
 Yeah, well, good. 
 Where are you going? 
 What do you mean? I'm going to get a drink. 
 No, it ain't too comfortable in there. We're going shopping. 
 Shopping? Around here? 
 Yes, I need some new shoes. Quality shoes. 
 Where better to get them? 
 You are in for a treat today, I promise. 
 Am I? And where are we going, Victor? 
 Oh, only the best store in the world. 
 You'll be tempted by everything. 
 Did you see the doctor, Victor? 
 Yes, I did indeed. 
 He said I was in a splendid condition. 
 Oh. 
 I made a remarkable recovery from my troubles. 
 That I'm an example to others, and now a model citizen. 
 And he gave you something for your headaches, did he? 
 My headaches are gone. 
 I am gloriously empty up here. 
 No pain, no worries, no thoughts of any kind. 
 You need the medicine in case they come back. The headaches. 
 You know how strong they can be. 
 They won't come back. If I do enough shopping, they won't come back. 
 See? 
 Everything you could have ever wanted. It's all here. 
 All at black market prices, Victor. 
 Look at this. This is peroxide. 
 Five, please. 
 What do you need five for? 
 Five. Marmalade. 
 Oh, we really need some of that. 
 That's the nearest anyone's going to get to real oranges for years, brother. 
 [TRAIN RATTLES OVERHEAD] 
 Guns or shoes. 
 What do you think? Probably need shoes a little more, but it's a tough choice, though. 
 You love a good gun, don't you? 
 I've got enough guns, thank you. 
 Come on. 
 Really, Victor. 
 I told you this was the place for shoes. 
 So why don't you get some? Good shoes are the answer to everything. 
 Thank you, sir. 
 The vermin are back. 
 I'm certainly not going to let them go shopping. 
 f*cking Blackshirt! 
 Blackshirts want to go shopping, do they? 
 f*ck! 
 You f*cking...! 
 They won't come shopping again in a hurry. 
 What happened? You all right? 
 Yes. Just going to clean myself up. 
 Victor! 
 Cal, don't kill him. 
 [BLACKSHIRT GASPS FOR AIR] 
 Don't want to kill him, Cal! 
 No need to kill him! 
 Now, f*ck off! 
 f*ck off! 
 Thought I better stop you. 
 I'd have loved to see you kill him, but, in the end, it might have spoiled our day a bit. 
 Well, this is true. 
 If anyone's going to kill you, Victor, it's not going to be a Blackshirt. 
 The shopping! We've lost all the shopping. 
 We've got to get some of it back at least. 
 Here are the shoes! 
 What's happened? They haven't gone missing, have they? 
 No, sir. They're being happily looked after. 
 Well, then what's the matter? 
 Oh, that? It's nothing. 
 I've just been fishing. 
 And there's a lady waiting for you upstairs, sir. 
 I think she may be from the War Crimes Unit. 
 I know. Don't worry about it. 
 They seem to like it in here, sir. 
 I think it's going to be an American kind of meal, sir. 
 For the grand reopening. 
 There you are. 
 I thought you weren't going to turn up. 
 I may be from T-Force, but I always keep appointments. 
 They told me to wait up here, that this is where your office is. 
 So it is. 
 How did you get like that? 
 What, that? 
 I just took a little trip to the suburbs. 
 Had to do some shopping. 
 Ran into some Blackshirts. 
 Well, here's the office. 
 All the files. 
 As you can see, there's not much here, really. 
 This is your office? 
 For the moment. 
 We're looking after a German aeronautical engineer and his daughter that's all we're doing here. 
 You don't need a big office for that. 
 I'll see if I can get permission to get you his file, but I doubt he's one of the people that you're interested in. 
 I'm always interested in seeing files. 
 I'm surprised that you haven't got a lot more. 
 You sure you haven't got any other rooms in the hotel you've forgotten about? 
 And this is where I'm sleeping, right here. 
 You can come into my bedroom if you like, but I don't have any more files. 
 I don't think I need to search your bedroom. No. 
 No. I doubt that's where you'd keep a lot of files. 
 Ah. 
 They've delivered my dinner jacket. 
 Good. 
 I need this for the grand reopening of the Basement Ballroom tonight. 
 You know, I do hope that they get an audience. 
 Now, if you'll excuse me, I ought to be getting ready. 
 That's it?  That  was our meeting, was it? 
 I know everyone in T-Force thinks the War Crimes Unit belongs in Germany, with the leaders who are going on trial there, and that's the end of the story, but there are in fact a lot of other people it's right to be concerned about. 
 People who aren't famous, who are guilty of war crimes, and they need to be found. 
 Isn't that true? 
 Of course. 
 I'll tell you what I'll do, Miss Griffiths. 
 If you give me a list of names of all the people that you're interested in, I will personally make sure that they're checked at Enfield. 
 Will you? 
 What is that supposed to mean? 
 It means I don't know how seriously to take that. 
 A lot of people on T-Force seem to think we're on different sides. 
 Do they? 
 Yes. 
 You're bringing over Germans who you think are vital for our national security and one or two of them may be the same people that we're trying to catch. 
 But you don't know what I think. 
 So that's a promise, is it, then? 
 You checking the names? 
 Yes. 
 It is a firm undertaking. 
 [BAND WARMING UP] 
 So, boys, look here. 
 A gift from a fan on a US air base here, and you'll never guess what it is. 
 THEY LAUGH I'm not sure this is right, but then... how does one dress for a really spooky place? 
 You look wonderful, my dear. 
 And that's all that matters. 
 I'm so proud of you. 
 [UPBEAT MUSIC PLAYS] 
 [GENTLE PIANO MELODY] 
 You play very well. 
 I just wanted to see if it was in tune. 
 And it is. What was the piece? 
 I forget what it's called. 
 I picked it up somewhere. 
 I heard somebody playing it once. 
 So you wrote it, did you? 
 No, no, no. Absolutely not, no, no, I don't write music. 
 It was a friend. 
 A friend. 
 I see. 
 They spent a great deal of money on this room before the war. 
 There were always a lot of extremely beautiful women in this room and none of them had any idea what was coming. 
 Amazing how unprepared we were. 
 Still surprises me how that was possible. 
 Yes. 
 Are you saying yes because you agree or are you simply saying yes? 
 Yes, I agree. 
 Few people could disagree with that, could they? 
 Oh, you're very wrong about that. 
 Some people want to protect themselves against blame in the face of everything. 
 You're from T-Force, aren't you? 
 Oh, come on, surely you can tell me that, can't you? 
 You are saved by my ward. 
 Doesn't she look good? Say hello to the pianist. 
 Maybe even the composer. 
 Hello. 
 We're going to the Basement after dinner. 
 Not going to risk the food down there. 
 I have a feeling everybody will be doing that. 
 The chef has decided on an American feel and he's serving corn on the cob, quite forgetting that we only feed that to cattle in this country.

 My... Alex, this is not spooky at all. 
 Little bit quiet maybe. 
 Well, apart from the music. 
 You must be the German family. 
 How delightful to meet you both. 
 Is that a new dress? 
 Were the boys in charge of getting that? 
 Well, whatever happens, I think you and I need to go shopping, don't you? 
 I'll help you get a real dress.

 [SCATTERED APPLAUSE] 
 How long we gotta wait before they start crawling down here? 
 Bring me one of them oranges, boys. 
 I am certainly not going to kill myself for this lot. 
 Woman : Is that an orange? 
 You want a piece of this, do you? 
 I need a sharp knife. 
 Well, come on downstairs and you can have one each. 
 It's hard to believe, but you can. 
 You just don't know what's going on down there, do you? 
 Come on, you must come with us. 
 I put Lotte to bed, then I will see.

 Are you lost? 
 No, I'm not lost. 
 Not very much. 
 Just a little lost? 
 Then let me... let me take you back to your room.
