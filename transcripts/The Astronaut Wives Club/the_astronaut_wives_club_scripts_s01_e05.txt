 Previously on "The Astronaut Wives Club"... 
 The Gemini men are arriving in a few weeks. 
 Don't worry, babe. Those guys are the "B" team. 
 The Gemini wives... the new nine? 
 Now Mercury's over. It's go time. 
 Mercury is not over. 
 You might as well be the first to know. 
 Deke is being promoted. 
 I'm writing my article myself. 
 I'd like people to know the real me. 
 Pigs will fly in space before a woman does. 
 Pigs  have  flown in space. 
 Did you know that your friend Dot won the All-Woman air race? 
 Yeah. We were training together. 
 It's our time. 
 [Sharon Jones & the Dap-Kings' "Long Time, Wrong Time"] 
 Thank you. 
 Thanks. 
 [Car door closes] 
 You really don't notice anything different about me? 
 Oh, come on. Don't make me guess. 
 I mean, I... the shoes? 
 The hair. 
 It's completely different. 
 What guy notices hair?

 Wonder where Trudy Cooper's off to? 
 Oh, those Mercury wives never seem to have much time for us, do they? 
 Well, I'm sure they're just busy being Mercury wives. 
 Look at them. Like moths to a flame. 
 [Speaks indistinctly] Oh, hi. 
 Betty : That was us not too long ago. 
 We were butterflies, never moths. 
 We spread our gossamer wings with grace. 
 But Th-they're just n-n-nervous like w-we were. 
 Well, I'm still a little nervous. 
 You? Why? 
 Well, you see that man over there in the red tie? 
 That's Cal Butterfield. 
 He's the editor of "The Post-Inquirer." 
 I'm gonna go and meet him tonight, and I'm gonna get myself a job. 
 Job? 
 [Camera shutter clicks] 
 [Engine rumbling] 
 [Airplane door closes] 
 What the hell happened? 
 I barely recognize you. 
 You're exactly the same. 
 [Chuckles] 
 [Billy May & his Orchestra's "Long Gone" playing] 
 Mr. Glenn, Stu Warren. 
 We met at Hickory Hill last year. 
 Stu, sure. Call me John, please. 
 Well, John... 
 You mind if we have a moment in private? 
 [Chuckles] 
 Sure. 
 Ma'am. 
 Mrs. Glenn, Mrs. Ted Wilkins. 
 And this is Mrs. Frank de Longpre. 
 We just wanted to introduce ourselves. 
 We have such admiration watching you and your husband. 
 You are our favorite astronaut wife. 
 [Laughs] 
 It's true! 
 Th-Th... thank... 
 Y-you. [Chuckles] 
 We're so sorry. 
 If... if you'll excuse us. [Chuckles nervously] 
 [Indistinct conversations] 
 What happened? 
 Rene Carpenter. 
 Astronaut Scott Carpenter's wife. 
 Guess astronauts get all the luck. 
 Mr. Butterfield, I wanted to talk to you tonight because... 
 Well, because I'd like to write a column for your paper. 
 Your own column? 
 Is that so? 
 I have a lot of ideas, and I believe I could offer a unique perspective, something that I feel the paper needs. 
 I'm more than capable, and if you give me half an hour of your time, I could prove it to you. 
 All right. 
 Meet me this Friday at 4:00. 
 The address is 423 Park. 
 Well, all right, then. I'll see you there. 
 Who's that guy? 
 My new boss.

 For now. 
 What's this I hear about you leaving after Gordo goes up? 
 Trudy told me you're quitting the magazine for San Francisco? 
 Yes, I, uh... 
 I have a friend who's starting a progressive paper out there. 
 Uh, politics, social issues, that sort of thing. 
 There's a lot going on out in California, and I-I knew I'd regret it if I didn't give it a try. 
 Well, word of advice, don't try everything those beatniks give you. 
 My cousin knew a guy. Thought it was tobacco. 
 Woke up two days later on a freight train to Missoula, missing a pinkie finger. 
 Well, it sounds like a great opportunity.

 [Both laugh] 
 You know I came back for Gordo to get a mission. 
 And you know what? It's happening. 
 And I get to be there up close, closer than anyone. 
 Unless  you  were the astronaut. 
 Do you have any idea where I've been while you've had your face buried in "Good Housekeeping"? 
 The Lovelace Clinic. 
 A woman? 
 Yeah. 
 At Dr. Lovelace's test facility? 
 He made a trip to Russia. 
 They train women right alongside the men there. 
 So he decided to do an experiment. 
 We're called F.L.A.T.S.... 
 First Lady Astronaut Trainees. 
 [Exhales] 
 You're gonna be an astronaut? 
 [Chuckles] 
 Well, not yet. 
 13 of us passed every test that the Mercury guys did. 
 I'm talking physical, psych, you name it. 
 But NASA won't let us onto a military base to do the training. 
 That's... 
 Total b.s., I know, which is why I'm going to Washington. 
 In two days, a subcommittee has to make a decision about NASA changing their policy. 
 Me and Jackie Cochran are testifying. 
 Oh! 
 And so are two Mercury astronauts. 
 What? Well, wh-which ones? 
 I don't know. 
 That's what I wanted to talk to you about. 
 Trudy, do you realize? 
 This is our chance to go into space. 
 So that fellow tonight, Stu Warren? 
 Uh, he's Bobby Kennedy's chief advisor, and, uh... 
 Well, it turns out, Bobby's been thinking of me, uh, for the election. 
 There's an Ohio senate seat in contention this November, and this guy Stu says they're ready to put everything behind me. 
 [Exhales deeply] 
 Run... for o-o-office? 
 But y-you are... you're an astronaut. 
 Well, Stu says that's a big asset. 
 All these new guys, they all have degrees. 
 No one's really talking about me for the Gemini missions.

 All the same tests? 
 Lovelace must've been going easy on you. 
 All right, how long did you last in the deprivation chamber? 
 I won that one. 
 3 hours and change till the hallucinations got ugly. 
 8 hours, 42 minutes. 
 Oh, come on. 
 Just like the rest of 'em. 
 Can't imagine a female in space unless she's pulling a cake out of the oven. 
 Well, I mean, space cake does sound nice. [Chuckles] 
 I just can't believe you knew about the hearings the whole time and never told me. 
 Trudy, I'm sorry. 
 All I heard was John and Scott were asked to testify. 
 And what are they going to say? 
 How should I know? 
 You didn't ask? 
 I've got a launch in two weeks. 
 There's a few other things on my mind. 
 [Glass thuds] 
 You should look at the test results, Gordo. 
 Women have more endurance than men and are less emotional. 
 Less emotional? Really? 
 Seriously? Don't even bother. 
 You ever seen this one during her time of the month? 
 Imagine being locked in a steel capsule with that hurdlin' through space. [Chuckles] 
 Oh, come on. It's way too serious in here. 
 All right, fine, I'm gonna hit the hay. 
 [Glass thuds] 
 And where do you think you're going? 
 Dot's sleepin' in the spare room, So I'm sleepin'... 
 In the den. 
 Okay. 
 Married life. 
 [Groans] 
 Forget him. 
 But Scott Carpenter and John Glenn are two of the most open-minded guys in Mercury. 
 If we put together some talking points, I think they'll support us. 
 We've got the truth on our side. 
 [Glass thuds] I'll get my statement. 
 Oh, this heat. I swear I'm like a pot roast in here. 
 Well-done and still cookin'. 
 [Sighs] This heat wave is killin' me. 
 You have to calm down. It'll only make things worse. 
 Get down low, get somewhere down low. 
 [Sighs] I could kill Wally for this... 
 When it's cooler. 
 [Sighs] And you know what I heard? 
 That Marilyn See? 
 She's happy as a clam and cool as a cucumber. 
 Wait a minute. 
 She has air conditioning? 
 [Exhales] 
 [Doorbell rings] 
 Hello. 
 Hi, Marilyn. How are you? 
 We were talking just now, and one thing led to another, and we realized, well, gosh, we need to welcome Marilyn See to the neighborhood. 
 So... 
 I've been living here six months now. 
 Better late than never. 
 Well, thank you. I'm... 
 I'm not really prepared for company right now. 
 I was just looking through some slides. 
 Elliot took me to Acapulco last winter... 
 Oh, well, that just sounds wonderful. 
 We love Acapulco. 
 Just crazy for it. 
 Well... then, come on in, I suppose. 
 [Door bell jingles, indistinct conversations] 
 That sounds wonderful. 
 And you'll be writing about what you really care about. 
 No more astrowife puff pieces. 
 I never called them that. 
 To anyone's face. 
 I imagine you'll meet all kinds of interesting people. 
 And you won't miss the Houston humidity. 
 Louise, why did you invite me to lunch? 
 Do I need a reason? 
 I thought we were friends. 
 Friends? 
 "Best wishes, Louise." 
 That's all you wrote on the card you sent. 
 What else could I say? 
 I'm leaving right after Gordo's launch. 
 If you wanna see me, let me know. 
 Anytime. 
 Women weigh less and consume less than men. 
 We're more radiation-resistant and less susceptible to heart attacks, monotony, loneliness, heat, cold, and pain. 
 There were women on the "Mayflower," and on the first wagon trains west. 
 Now we ask to be a part of the pioneering of space. 
 We offer you 13 qualified volunteers who are ready to take on that challenge. 
 Thank you, Ms. Bingham. 
 If the whole purpose of space exploration is to someday colonize other planets, I don't see how we can do that without women. 
 [Laughter] 
 Now you passed all the tests required for eligibility to Project Mercury. 
 Yes, sir, everything from swallowing 3 feet of rubber hose to crash landings in the Dilbert Dunker, and an airborne E.E.G. 
 That means flying a jet through a high-gravity load-stress pattern with 18 monitor needles stuck in my head. 
 [Gallery murmurs] 
 Does this mean you now qualify for astronaut training? 
 No, sir. 
 NASA Requires that all astronauts have jet test pilot experience, but the only test pilot schools in the United States are operated by military services, which don't allow women. 
 It is currently impossible for women to fulfill that requirement. 
 Do you feel it's essential for astronauts to have test pilot experience? 
 No, sir. 
 Some of us in this group have 8,000 to 10,000 flying hours. 
 Now that's four times the amount of hours of some of the Mercury Seven, with no greater accident rates than our male counterparts. 
 We have a very real contribution to make. 
 [Gallery murmurs] 
 Cal : Surprise, surprise. She did show up. 
 Hello, Mr. Butterfield. 
 Well, hello there. 
 All right, boys, why don't you give me and the little lady here a few minutes? 
 ♪ 
 Thank you. 
 So, Mrs. Carpenter, astrowife turned aspiring journalist. 
 I'll have to admit, never heard of that before. 
 Well, that's exactly why you should hire me. 
 I do believe that as a forward-thinking woman, I could offer a very unique perspective to your paper, something I mentioned to you the other night. 
 I'm sure, I'm sure. 
 We have a recipe column in our paper. 
 I was thinking, assuming, you and I get along, that I could work you in as an alternate once a month. 
 Mr. Butterfield, I used to edit my high school newspaper, and in college I majored in history, and... 
 I wrote my own "Life" profile. 
 I'm interested in far more than just recipes. 
 Between you and me, I don't understand why a woman like you wants to write at all. 
 I take myself very seriously, Mr. Butterfield, and perhaps you could do the same, starting by meeting me in your office and not on your second Martini. 
 Excuse me? 
 I have reporters on my staff with 20 years experience... war correspondence, published authors, remind me exactly why I should take you seriously? 
 Is it the one article you wrote about yourself? 
 Or the fact that you're married to an astronaut whose name I don't even remember? 
 ♪ 
 All right. 
 Well, you tell me what it is I need to do to prove myself to you as a writer. 
 As a writer? 
 Why don't you bring me 20 sample articles? 
 Then we'll talk. 
 20? 
 Unless you're not up to it. 
 ♪ 
 Honorable members of congress, Colonel John Glenn and Commander Malcolm Scott Carpenter. 
 [Camera shutters clicking] 
 [Lowered voice] It's okay. They're the good guys. 
 Now on the subject of our previous inquiry, Colonel Glenn, do you think an astronaut has to be a test pilot? 
 Well, first, sir, I'd like to say that I'm not anti any particular group... whatever s*x, color, creed, or... or anything else. 
 I'm just pro space. 
 Uh, to your question, test pilots are expected to perform functions under high stress, which is exactly why we are ideal candidates to deal with the pressures of space travel. 
 What about the extensive hours in civilian aircraft flown by these women pilots? 
 Is that not equivalent experience? 
 Well, you can have thousands of flight hours in a civilian craft. 
 You just don't come up against the same emergencies as you do as a test pilot. 
 There's no comparison. 
 But, Colonel Glenn, didn't NASA relax certain requirements to admit  you into the Mercury program? 
 Yes, I, uh... 
 I did not have an engineering degree at the time of my selection, but it was agreed that I had the equivalency of a degree due to my experience. 
 By that logic, a woman with equivalent abilities shouldn't be rejected because of a requirement she's barred from fulfilling. 
 Don't you agree? 
 Let me say this... if we could find women today with the exact qualifications as our best male astronauts, we should surely welcome them into the program with open arms. 
 [Gallery murmurs] 
 Man : And you, Commander Carpenter, do you think a woman can stand the pace and stress of being an astronaut? 
 I believe the answer is yes. 
 But... 
 With the space race in full throttle, the U.S. needs to choose people with the best qualifications. 
 And... 
 At this time... 
 We can't find that type of woman. 
 [Gallery murmuring] 
 [Indistinct conversations] 
 What was that? 
 In five minutes, you managed to ruin everything those women have spent years trying to achieve. 
 Trudy, I wanted to help... 
 Astronauts should be test pilots. 
 I-I'm sorry that women don't have that opportunity, Trudy, but that's our opinion. 
 Why don't you admit what this is really about? 
 I hear Gordo talk. This isn't about women at all. 
 It's about civilians. 
 You're afraid a bunch of scientists will swoop in and take your jobs. 
 If you open the door to us, you open the door to them, too, so you're keeping everybody down. 
 Like I said, we believe astronauts should be test pilots. 
 [Indistinct conversations] 
 [Whispers] I'm sorry, Trudy. 
 Apologize to your daughters.

 Alan Shepard likes those cape cookies, too. 
 He likes them so much, I don't think he'll be going back into space anytime soon. 
 There's no fuel left in his "rocket," Bob.

[Camera shutter clicks] Yes, but proud, too. Dot did great. And all the smart things she said got written down, and now they're a part of history. [Projector clicking] The funny thing is, is Elliot's been so worried about how I've been getting along, you know, socially, and now I have Betty Grissom and Jo Schirra coming over almost every afternoon.

He's got carbon dioxide building up and the capsule's overheating. He's gonna have to come down now. Just wanted you to know. [Exhales] How will he get the right angle for re-entry without the automatic system? Well, he's gonna have to do it manually. He can use the horizon as a point of reference and then calculate the... Manually? John, you tell Gordo that the girls and I are coming to Hawaii. You tell him that this couldn't happen to a better pilot, and we will be there when he lands, no matter what. I will. [Inhales deeply] He can do it. I believe that. I know you do. [Receiver clatters] [Receiver clatters] [Taps button] "Faith 7," this is Capcom. Do you read? [Static crackling] [Taps button] Gordo?

[Engine starts] Man on TV : Beating terrifying odds, Astronaut Gordo Cooper positions "Faith 7" perfectly for re-entry into earth's atmosphere, the best landing in Mercury history, right on the old bazoo in the first-ever completely manual landing. Cooper now holds the world record of 34 hours and 22 orbits in space. [Blades whirring] [Applause] Aloha. Man : Commander! Commander Cooper! Word is you just got off the phone with President Kennedy. Could you tell us what he said to you after your historic landing? The president believes I've proved once and for all that astronauts aren't just "Spam in a can." They need to be pilots... proven pilots. They're no way around that. And how did you get to be such a good pilot? Well, not many people know this, but my wife Trudy was a pilot before I became one. She's the one who suggested I get my license right here in Hawaii, where we met. And not only is she the best teacher a pilot could have, but... There's just no way I could be standing right here, right now without her. Excuse me. [Chuckles] [Applause] John said you were coming, but... I thought he was just leading me on to keep me wantin' to live. [Laughs] [Applause] [Opens drawer] I can't do this anymore. [Closes drawer] What's that? "Lady Louise," "frosty." Your "rock." W-where is this coming from? I watched you go up into space, and I pretended I was never worried. I know you're with other women, and I pretend I don't care. I look the other way when I find condoms in your bag and act like it's funny when the whole world laughs about your... rocket. I don't want anyone else. You and me, together. It's all I ever wanted. People say I'm supposed to ask for what I want. [Whispers] This is what I want. You. All to myself. [Typewriter keys clacking] -  Rene: Women often marvel about how I brave I am, but I've never felt brave. To witness true bravery, one should look instead at the events of the past 12 months.

[Continues indistinctly] Nobody can stand sittin' in front of the TV for another minute. We're all gathering down at the park. Gonna try and get something to eat. On a day like today, it just...
