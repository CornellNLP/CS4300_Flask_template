 Previously on  Gotham... 
 Loeb :  My best wishes to  Commissioner Essen. 
 Welcome back, Jim. 
 I don't know how you pulled this off, but I'm glad you did. 
 Bruce :  Sometimes the right way is also the ugly way. 
 Essen :  There's been an incident at Arkham Asylum. 
 Six inmates have escaped. Barbara Kean was one of them. Oh, my God. The world sees criminal lunatics. I see brilliance. Gotham will tremble Bruce :  "I beg of you, my son, please choose happiness. Unless you feel a calling.  A true calling." Theo :  Mr. Mayor,  you want to know what I really am? James (muffled) : Yes, sir. Shall I tell you? Please, please. (sobs) At heart... I'm an ardent student of human nature. Fascinating paradox, we are. So wise, and yet so foolish. So brave, and yet so fearful. For instance, this is a glass jar. Inside of it is a hairy spider. A tarantula, I guess, but I'm no expert. (sobs) In a minute, I'm gonna open that little hatch in the front of your box, I'm gonna drop the spider inside, and I'm gonna close it. (sobs) That's choice A. Choice B: I open the hatch, you speak to your lovely secretary Maggie on the telephone, you tell her you've run away with some woman, you'll be sending written instructions shortly. So which is it, choice A or choice B? Choice B, please. Please, choice B. The telephone. Of course. It's human nature. See? There is no spider. But if you don't do what I ask, you'll wish there was one. Why are you doing this to me? Don't fret so. You're part of a great endeavor. A great cleansing. Monsters are coming, Mr. Mayor. Monsters. Who will cleanse this city in blood and fire. (urgent chatter, phones ringing) What the hell is this? (man screams outside) "Where is Mayor James? Who is his mystery lover?" No one cares who the mayor is banging! (man screams outside) You can do better than this, people. Now go out and get me some headlines, damn it! (man screams outside) (people murmuring) Yeah. All right, all right. Oh, my God. (man screams) (body thuds) Perfect. Next. Mr. X. (muffled whimpering) (laughs) (grunts) Uh, a little to the right. Okay, that's the spot. (man screams) (body thuds) (crowd gasps in distance) Perfect. What shall we do with the... spare? Ooh! I know. (sighs) Aaron. Would you kindly? (man screams) (body thuds, crowd gasps in distance) "Maniax!" (laughs) Now that's a headline. (cackles) You all know what we're facing here. 48 hours ago, six criminally insane inmates were busted out of Arkham Asylum. Yesterday, four of those inmates broke into Yellen Shipyard, kidnapped seven workers, then dropped them off the roof of the  Gotham Gazette. As of now, we still have no leads on the person or persons behind the breakout. Jim Gordon's lead. Jim. These are our targets. Jerome Valeska, 18 years old. Matricide. Arnold Dobkins, schizophrenic. Poisoner, rapist. Aaron Helzinger. Killed his entire family with his bare hands. Robert Greenwood. Killed and then ate a dozen women. Barbara Kean. Killed her parents. We're gonna work this in groups of four. I'll hand out assignments throughout the day. Alvarez is my coordinating officer. Any questions? Let's get to work. Fine job yesterday, gentlemen. We opened big. The whole city knows your name now. So, bravo. Let's give ourselves a round of applause. Now that we have Gotham's attention, it's time for the Maniax to make a grand entrance. Wasn't that it? That was the overture. Now the audience is hushed, expectant. The curtain rises... Then what happens? Oh, then we confront Gothamites with their most primal fears. Take from them all they hold dear and sacred. And then what happens? Why, then, we offer them salvation. And then they are ours. Let's get busy, man. Patience. First, you gentlemen need to learn a little stagecraft. Stagecraft? You're going to be on TV. You have to present yourselves with style and vigor. Dobkins, say "Good evening, ladies and gentlemen." Good evening, ladies and gentlemen. Again, with a smile. Good evening, ladies and gentlemen. (sighs) You. (clears throat) Good evening, ladies and gentlemen! Not bad. Sinister and authoritative. Never mind. Jerome. (clears throat) Ladies and gentlemen, good evening! Very good. Boyishly charming. (cackles) The laugh is fabulous. Use that. (whip cracks) James : Ow! Ow! Ow! (women laughing) (laughing) Barbara : Now me. Ow! I am so glad that you two are getting along, but we're a little busy here, so if you could leave the poor mayor alone... We're bored. Yeah. Why do the boys get to have all the fun? Your time is coming. I told you. You haven't killed him, have you? No, I don't think so. (muffled groaning) Nope. Hanging in there. When? When is my time coming? Soon. Very soon. Why don't you tell me about James Gordon. What do you want to know? It's hard to believe. My father's been sneaking down here for years, and I never even knew about it. That makes two of us, doesn't it? Wait. Let's just think about this. Are you certain you want to turn that bloody thing on? Of course I'm certain. Have you thought it through, Master Bruce? This computer could contain all my father's research into Wayne Enterprises. All this time, I've been looking for a smoking gun, and here it is. Exactly. A smoking gun. Now, guns are for grown-ups, aren't they? That's a metaphor, Alfred, not an argument. (computer whirring, beeping) Here it is. It's working! What are you... What are you doing?! Alfred, stop! What are you doing?! No, what are you doing, Alfred?! Alfred, stop it! It's ruined! It's ruined! What's wrong with you?! Why would you do that?! Answer me! It had to be done, Master Bruce! This was the key to exposing Wayne Enterprises. Everything that I've worked for, everything my... everything my dad worked for is now gone! Because of you! If I'd known what was down here, I would have never helped get you in. I mean, look around you. Look, look. Liters of blood. A bulletproof vest with two slugs in it! Guns, weapons! I mean, whatever's on that computer probably killed your father, and I'll be damned if I see you suffer the same fate, Master Bruce. (sniffles) I'm trying to protect you. (sobs softly) I'm trying to keep you safe. I want you to go. Look, I know that you're... No. that you're upset, you... Alfred. I want you to go and never come back, do you understand me? You're fired. Very well, Master Bruce. As you wish. (footsteps receding) Ooh! Shiny. (laughs) Give that back. I saw it first. No, you didn't. I said give it back. Make me, you little brat. Dobkins : Ooh. Ooh. (chuckles) Jerome : Your samurai skills are excellent Greenwood San, but they are nothing compared to me. (chain saw buzzing) Prepare to die! Rum, rum, rum! (laughs) That's enough! That's good. I tried to stop them. Boys, we're a team. We don't fight amongst ourselves. Yeah, we're a  team,  boys. And I'm the captain. Captain of my foot. I've murdered a dozen women. Terrorized the city. What have you done? Chop up your mommy? Everybody has to start somewhere. See, I have vision and ambition and brains. You're just a nutty old cannibal. How many people can you eat before that shtick gets old? I could eat one more. Theo : I can see we're gonna have to resolve this one once and for all. You all know this game, right? Oh, love it. Who wants to be the boss? Ladies first. (gun clicks) (chuckles) Hey, Greenwood, what's the secret to good comedy? (gun clicks) Timing. And what's courage? (gun clicks) Grace under pressure. And... who's the boss? (gun clicks) I'm the boss. (laughing) I believe you are, Jerome. I believe you are. Arigato, sensei. Whoo! Hee! (music playing) Thank you. Four lunatics and Barbara? Brother, you got no luck. I told you civilian life was better, didn't I? Yeah, you did. Actually, that's kind of why I'm here. Yeah? Yeah. Scotty : What are you doing here? Jim, you remember Scotty, my girlfriend. Fiancée. Right, my fiancée. Yeah, Scotty, good to see you. Relax, honey bun. We're just talking. Oh, like hell you are. He's gonna ask you to come back to work. He didn't ask me anything. We're just having a chat. Oh, is that right? Is that why you're here, Detective? Just to have a chat? No, no. She's right. Harvey, I need your help. The case is a bear. We're short-handed, and, uh, I was thinking maybe you could... He has a life. The answer is no. He is not coming back. Bullock : Hon. I'm telling him no. But it's like she said, I have a life. I get it. I get it. I'm happy for you. Just a thought. Wish me luck. Good luck. Jim, one last thing. One last thought from your Uncle Harvey. These Maniax killed a bunch of people from the shipyard, right? Yellen Shipyard, yeah. Why there? They could've gone anywhere, killed anyone. But these lunatics specifically chose that shipyard. I... wonder why. Good to see you. Scotty. Gordon : Yeah. Call you back. Commissioner! Tell me something good. Please. Harvey isn't coming back. That's not good. But he did suggest a lead that panned out nicely. Turns out, the Maniax stole a refueling truck from the shipyard yesterday. Why wasn't it reported? It was one of over a hundred service vehicles. Took a while to track down the entire fleet. But when we did, we found that one was missing. Fully loaded with gasoline. You get a license plate? And a description of the vehicle. Put out an APB. God, I'm so glad you're back, Jim. Me, too. Wish I could say the same for Bullock. I-I can't believe he's really gone. He's a cop. He was born to be a cop. Not anymore. He's a happy man. I didn't have it in me to push him. You ever think about that? Walking away, I mean. No. You? I did, for a long time. But not anymore? I've sat back and watched all the corrupt, lazy men buy their way into this job and waste it. Not me, Jim. Not me. A new day. You're damn right. I'd just like to say it's been an honor and a privilege to serve you and your family, sir. Thank you. If you need any references, I'll be happy to provide them. Is that all you're taking with you? It's all I have, sir. Right. Well, um... Oh, dear, yes. I best be off. I've got a train to catch. Good-bye, sir. Good-bye, Alfred. Beg your pardon, sir? I said good-bye. Yes. Good-bye, sir. I spy with my little eye something that is... yellow. (chanting): Score, Gotham, score! We want more! Hit 'em where it hurts and knock 'em to the floor! (whooping) Yay, Gotham! Oh. Hello, Ms. Kringle. (door closes) Hello, Mr. Nygma. How's your day going? (chuckles) Fine. Um, question for you. Y-Yes? Um... (laughs) Did you know that houseflies hum in the key of F? (sighs) No. (clears throat) No, I-I did not know that. Okay, then. Well, uh... bye. Bye. Damn it! We agreed you were going to ask her out. No, we didn't agree to ask her. We agreed to think about asking her. But there's no point. She doesn't like you. Nygma : Maybe she'll like me. You ever consider that? Maybe she'll like me. I got confidence. Ladies love that. No, she won't like you. She won't. Go away. Please, just go away! 
 
 Hey. (cheerleaders cheering) (horn honking) Ooh! (cheerleaders murmuring) (sighs) (cheerleaders screaming) We got a sighting of the stolen truck. Yeavely Park. (cheerleaders whimpering) Jerome : I want you all to know this was a very difficult decision for us. It was between you and a senior citizen bingo party. In the end, we decided to skew a little younger. Youth won the day. Sorry. Give me an "O"! (cheerleaders whimpering) (cheerleaders screaming) I said give me a "O." Cheerleaders : "O." Jerome : Give me an "N." Cheerleaders : "N." Give me another "O"! Cheerleaders : "O." What does that spell? "Oh, no!" (cheerleaders screaming) Do it! Do it! Do it! Ready? Okay! (cheerleaders screaming) This is so embarrassing. Anyone got a light? I do. I got... (sirens approaching) (tires screeching) Jerome : Stand your ground, boys. They can't shoot at a bus. Hold your fire! Hold your fire! Aaron, Greenwood, get the truck started. We're gonna blow this barbecue. Oh. (gun clicks) Light 'em up! (Jerome cackling) (cheerleaders screaming) (cackling) (cackling) (cheerleaders screaming) (engine starts) (explosion in distance, cheerleaders scream) (cheerleaders sobbing) Everybody okay? Who broke you out, Dobkins? Gonna have to talk sooner or later; tell me now. I'm a victim here, sir. I was coerced. Abducted and coerced. By who? If I tell you that, I got to get some kind of guaran... (silenced gunshots) (man speaking indistinctly over P.A.) I understand you were just trying to protect me. But there's nothing... nothing that you can do to stop me from carrying out my father's work. I know that now. I don't want you to go, Alfred. But you're either with me or you're against me. And if you're against me, I don't have a choice. I'm with you, Master Bruce. I've always been with you. But what you're doing is tantamount to suicide. This is big boy stuff. You're too young; you're not ready. Then make me ready. You-You've lived a dangerous life, and you survived. So teach me. Teach me how to do the same. I'll do whatever it takes. I'll train every day. Yeah, well, you said that before, didn't you? That was before. Now I know the truth. And I know what I have to do. I'll even go back to school if you want. School, even? If I agree to help you, to make you ready, you must do exactly as I say and when I say it with no exceptions, is that understood? Understood. But, in return, you must fix that computer. Fix it? How on earth am I gonna do that? That's not my problem. I'm not the one who broke it. High caliber, high velocity. Judging by the size of the wounds, it was definitely shot from some distance. Someone knew how to shoot. Who, damn it? And why cheerleaders? Where's the motive? They didn't even ask for a ransom. They want headlines. They want mass panic. Well, they got it. Essen : Yeah. Let's see if we can't I.D. that bullet. Never know your luck. (door opens, closes) (sighs) Holding up? Holding up. Love you. Likewise. (door opens, closes) ("In a Sentimental Mood" by Duke Ellington & John Coltrane plays) Gin and tonic, please, uh, governor. Ice and a slice. Nice place. It is. Been here before, then, have you? It's my regular spot. Oh, right, you're a local. Nice. Don't I know you? Do you? Yeah. You're that Mr. Fox, that scientific chap from Wayne Enterprises, ain't you? That is me. Alfred Pennyworth. Young Master Bruce Wayne's guardian. Ah, yes. It's a funny old game though, isn't it? Coincidence, I mean, me bumping into you like this. I mean... I was just thinking about you. Hmm. Okay, Mr. Pennyworth, I'll bite. What were you thinking about me? Oh, no. "Alfred," please. Please, "Lucius." Lucius. Lucius. You know... I once knew this geezer called Onslow in the Isle of Dogs in the East End of London. Lairy little scallywag, he was. He was, uh, too smart by half; never trusted him. Anyway, one day, Lucius, he comes bowling up to me, and he asks me to do him this right iffy favor. Oh, it doesn't matter what it was. The point being, against my better judgment, I agreed to do it. But, Lucius, I told him, I told him straight, I said, "You let me down, Onslow, I'll tuck you up, sunshine, like a kipper." He swears blind, swears on his mother's grave he'd never do such a thing, but of course he did. Couldn't help himself; he let me down. So I tucked him up. Like a kipper. What is a kipper? It's a type of smoked fish. Very nice with eggs and brown toast for breakfast. But what I learned from Onslow is this. There are two types of people on this planet, you see. Them you can trust... and them you can't. I cannot disagree. Which kind are you? Both kinds of people would give you the same answer, wouldn't they? Exactly. Exactly right. There lieth the problem, Lucius. You see, I need to confide in you. But I need to know that you're trustworthy. Perhaps I should decline your confidence. I don't like the sound of these kippers. Yeah, well, it's a bit late for that, unfortunately. I mean, it's you, after all, Lucius, that created this mess when you told young Master Bruce that his dear old dead dad... was a stoic. Ah. "Ah," exactly. You see, there's a problem. I got no one else to turn to. I have to confide in you. I see. Do you? Let me just be crystal clear about this. If it turns out... that I can't trust you, I swear on my mother's grave, you, my old sausage... are a dead man. I have only the best intentions for Bruce Wayne. Well, another gin and tonic please, uh, governor. And whatever this young man is drinking, one for yourself. How are you at fixing computers? (phone ringing) Hey, Alvarez! Yo. Let ballistics know we got a red ball for them, will you? On it. Gordon. Barbara : Hello, Jim. It's Barbara. Hi, Barbara. How are you? Barbara : Oh, me? I'm fabulous. How are you? I'm good. What's new? Oh, Mr. Cool Guy, huh? You must be so mad at me. Listen to me. If you turn yourself in, I can help you. (scoffs) How, Jim? By taking me back to Arkham? I don't think so. You're sick. Oh. Of course. Everything's always my fault. So typical. Listen to me. I know you, Barbara. I know you. You're a good, kind woman. This isn't you. (laughs) Oh, you could always make me laugh. (laughing) How do I look? I need to talk to Commissioner Essen right away. It's an emergency. Yeah, go ahead. She's right upstairs. Yo, Commish. Yeah? Heard you were looking for us. (explosion, gunfire, officers shouting) (Kringle screams) Barbara! Don't move. You're wrong about me, Jim. I tried telling you, but you never listen. I'm listening now. Yeah, sure you are. Now. Come on. Let's go talk this through, huh? Oh, it's too late for that. (Aaron yells) Ow. (thudding, grunting continues) Aaron. That's enough. (groans) I'm not sick. I'm free. You don't get that. I could explain it, but you should probably get back to work. Who knows what went wrong while you were gone? (gasps) (kisses) (man grunts) (gunfire, screaming continues in distance) (laughs) (whistles) Hell of a first week you're having, Commissioner. I wish I could tell you that things were gonna get better for you. They're not. Here, bring that up here. Get a better angle of the room. Why are you doing this? To rule the world. Blah, blah, blah. But we'll settle for some dead cops and some good P.R. (chuckles) Kidding. Yeah. Whatever. I get it. You're just crazy. "Crazy"? Look at me. You can see I'm not crazy. Very soon, little man, you will be dead. And the world will go on without you. You'll be nothing. No one will even remember your name. Mm. No. That is where you're wrong, old lady. We will leave a mark on this city. We will spread across it like a virus. Do you know why? There's nothing more contagious than laughter. My line. There's nothing more contagious than laughter. (laughs loudly) That was strangely pleasant. Do it again. Oh! That's gonna leave a mark. (laughing) You got me. My turn. (laughing) (grunting) ♪ ♪ (sighs) Lee? Jim! You hurt? No. I... I-I was in my office, and I heard gunfire and I hid. Where were you? Barbara was here. She lured me away. Essen! (panting) Hang on, Cap, hang on. Boss, boss, stay with me. Breathe. It's a new day... Jim. This is... indeed broken. I have a lot of questions for you. Ah, I imagine so. Did my father tell you everything? Heavens no. Your father, he was a very private man. He had to be. I simply helped with technical resources, like this computer. Do you know what's on it? No. I didn't want to know, to be honest. But you can fix it? Mm, I should think so. But it is going to take some time. Well, um, thank you for your help. I loved your father. I regret that I never told him so. I regret that I didn't help him more. Hand me the soldering iron, will you? Yeah. (footsteps approaching) Master Bruce? What is it, Alfred? Uh, how you doing, Mr. Nygma? I got you an aspirin. Thank you. Detective Gordon! Bruce. I heard the news. I... I was worried something happened to you. I'm very relieved. Me, too. Th-The last time that we met, I was... I was very hard on you. I wanted to apologize. You've been a really good friend. (helicopter whirring outside) Bullock : She was a good woman. Good cop. It's good to see you, but you don't have to do this. Let's not talk about it. We are who we are, right? No use fighting it. What does Scotty say? She'll understand. Or she won't. Officer : Guys. You need to see this. I'm reporting live from the scene of the GCPD massacre. We have just obtained video footage of the attack recorded by one of the assailants. I want to warn those of you watching, what you're about to see is very graphic. Hello, Gotham City! We're the Maniax. And I'm Jerome, the shot caller of our little gang. We're here to spread the message of wisdom and hope. (man groaning) (gunshot) Some people have no manners. You're all prisoners. What you call sanity, it's just a prison in your minds that stops you from seeing that you're just little tiny cogs in a giant absurd machine. Wake up! Why be a cog? Be free like us. (laughing): Just remember, smile. (laughing) (sirens approaching) Oh! Time to go. But don't worry. We'll be back very soon. Hang on to your hats, folks. 'Cause you ain't seen nothing yet! (laughing)
