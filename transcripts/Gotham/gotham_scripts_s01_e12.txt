 Previously on Gotham... 
 I wish something would happen to old man Falcone. 
 Who would take over then? 
 Let me guess. 
 Maroni had nothing to do with the armory job. 
 You have a mole, obviously. 
 Someone close to you. 
 Bullock : Arkham Asylum? 
 Security guard for nut jobs? Criminal nut jobs, yeah. Metal needles were inserted into the brain, and electricity was applied to his frontal lobes. I want you to find out which one  of our inmates did this. (bones snapping) Gruber : Well done, Aaron. Exactly like I told you. Now, you are my best work so far. (horn honking) (buzzer blaring) No. No, no. The merchandise has got to be mint, or you won't get a dime. (electrical crackling and whooshing, screaming) My God. Jack. Hi, Irwin. Where's my stuff? Aaron Danzig. Six-four, 225. Mental age of a young child. We believe he's under the control of this man, Jack Gruber. In Arkham off a rape/murder beef. We can't find any records on Gruber prior to his incarceration, so we're guessing Gruber is an alias. We're sending his prints nationwide, see if we can find another name for him. Whoever he is, he's clever and angry and a grave public menace. The commissioner is deeply concerned, and he's on his way here to talk to all of you right now. You know what that means. And you know... Jim? Captain. Hey, partner. Hi. You're out of your jurisdiction. Captain, this is my case. Jim, you need to get out of here. It's my case. No, no, no. The captain is right. You need to leave before the commissioner gets here. Why? Because he holds you responsible for all of this, and... oh, fudge. He's here. And you're there. Sidestep. Captain Essen. Good morning, Commissioner. Officer Gordon, isn't it? Yes, sir. Why are you here? I have a better question. Why are you here, Commissioner? Excuse me? This is the first I've seen you down here with the rank and file. You must be desperate. Follow me. Really nice knowing you. Loeb : Bring you friend Bullock. (whispering): I hate you. I hate you. It wasn't my idea; it was your friend. He came up with the double-cross, made me go along. You have a mind of your own, don't you? Hey, come on. See? (chuckles) I kept your gadgets safe. I know what it means to you, all your experiments. Oh, I appreciate that. Please. You don't have to kill me. I don't... have to do anything. I'm free. You know the funny thing? I think it was my time in Arkham that freed me. I mean, in here. Now I see the world for what it really is. An abandoned factory full of broken machines. Some... Very few... Can be fixed. Most... just have to be scrapped. Danzig, hold him, please. (whimpering) Please. Please, no, stop. Please. Please! Please! Two maniacs on the loose makes the whole Arkham Project look kind of shady, huh? The moneymen want results fast, I bet. You're strangely self-righteous, given that it was you that let these men escape. Blame me all you want. My name's already mud. Those two will still be out there, and that means you need me. James, why did you become a policeman? Your father was the district attorney. A proud station for a man of substance. You would think that would inspire a son to practice law. I'm enforcing the law. You want to talk about my dad or do you want to catch Gruber and Danzig? Where do you get the rebellious fire in your belly? Bullock : Can I take this opportunity to say that I have no rebellious fire here, nada. Jack Gruber is out there, planning a catastrophe. I know the man. I know how he thinks. I know what he'll do next. Which is what? That I'll keep to myself. I guarantee I'll bring in these two men, but first, I need you to reinstate me as detective first grade in the GCPD. Extortion, Officer Gordon. 24 hours? What? You've got 24 hours to bring these men in. You don't, you can both spend the rest of your miserable careers down at Arkham. That will be all, Detectives. What the hell just happened? It's okay, it's okay. Everything's gonna be fine, Harvey. Yeah? Yeah, we just got to catch the bad guys. Okay, where are we going? I don't know. What? You just told him you knew what Gruber was gonna do next. I lied. (women crying) Man : Please, Don Falcone, have mercy. We're family. I know, son. I know it's hard. A young man like you, it doesn't seem fair. (gun clicks) (whimpering): Please. Don Falcone, please! (gunshots) (thunder rumbling) This whole area used to be slums when I was a boy. Liza : You've come a long way. Some of your people are looking for you, you know. But you're the one I wanted to see. I've worked so long all my life to get where I am. So long, I forget why I wanted to be here. Well, you wanted to be someone. And you are. Look at all the stuff you have. (thunder rumbles) You're a good girl, Liza. You need to find a young man and get married, have babies. It's not fair of me, keeping you cooped up here, doing my housework. You'll never find a good husband here. Anyhow, if you'd like to get out in the world, I was thinking I could set you up with a bakery or some type of business like that. So you can be independent. That's really nice, Mr. F. Thank you. But I would rather be here with you. You would? I like it here. You make me feel safe. Well, good. I like having you here. Yeah. Maybe I'll try to get a little work done before dinner. I'm making something special tonight. (car door closing) (screaming) What are you laughing at? Ah, it's good to be back. Only a man from a lunatic asylum would say that. You're like a human roller coaster, except you only go down. Wouldn't that make him more of an elevator? You have anything useful, Ed? I got a little less than 20 hours before I lose my job. I do... have something useful. And it is? I cross-checked fingerprints. The clinically insane Jack Gruber of Arkham is a figment of the files. The man himself is really a career criminal by the name Jack Buchinsky. How is that even possible? Easy enough to bribe someone to change the records. Yep, apparently, he wanted to be transferred to Arkham. That's really good work, Ed. What's this Buttinsky's deal? Nygma : Uh, it's, uh, Buchinsky. It's all in the files. Just make sure you sign it out. It's classified information, so just be careful. Miss Kringle? (sighs) I believe you left this on my desk. It's a riddle. It's a cupcake with a live bullet sticking out of it. It's a riddle. It's menacing and weird and inedible. Thank you for the files, Miss Kringle. Bullock : This Buchinsky dude and his partners pulled four successful bank robberies, killed six along the way before the GCPD caught him by accident. He never named his accomplices. Gordon : He's in prison, he hears Arkham is opening its doors, so he uses his connections, and he gets himself a new identity as the mental patient Gruber. He must have some good connections. Right, and when the rest of the nuts get transferred to Arkham... voilà. So, he had partners, huh? Yeah, GCPD never identified them. They're still out there. Yep, we find them, we'll find him. Bullock : Easy enough, huh? Detective. A hit. Gordon : What do we got? Lead detectives dusted for prints, two sets... Gruber and Danzig, just like we thought. Right. Thanks. All right. Van checks out. It was them. Our man's an electronics freak, right? Yeah. Think he went shopping? He's dead. Fried like a doughnut. (faint squeaking) (faint squeaking continues) Gordon : GCPD. Turn around slowly, let me see those hands. Hey. (groans) Hey, buddy. Hey. Hey! (screams) Help, help! Please! Get back in the store. Okay. Take it easy. Okay. (tires screech) Please, there's been a terrible mistake. I am Don Falcone's housekeeper. Fish? Thank God. Why'd you have to pull me out like that? You scared the life out of me. It's time, Liza. I'm gonna make my move on Falcone. And don't be scared, baby girl. I got this. (phone rings) SCRAMBLED MALE Voice : Mr. Falcone, we have your girl, Liza. Would you like to see her again? Yes, I would. She'll be glad to hear that. For a fit young woman, she has a low pain threshold. Please! No! Stop! An intermediary will be in contact with you soon. Don't hurt her. She's a civilian. (call disconnects) Hello? What now? Now we let him sit and think about his life for a while. Bullock : "The Electrocutioner." Cute. No pressure. Don't worry, we'll get him. Yeah, and we got 17 hours to do so. I love the name. It's catchy, has drama. The Electro-cutioner. Speaking of which, given the general mode of attack, may I suggest you both wear your... department-issue galoshes while you're out in the field. Galoshes? In the event of electrical misadventure, your footwear should be insulated. No, Mom! I'm not gonna wear my rubbers on the case. Nygma, give 'em here. Seriously? Bullock : All right, so what do we know? Gruber wasn't too happy with Irwin. Maybe they were partners in crime, Irwin turned on him, Gruber took the fall. Detective Gordon. Dr. Thompkins. My friends call me Lee. Congratulations, you got your job back. Or not, depending. It's good to see you. Is it? I-I know you're caught up with the escape. That's why I'm here. Is everything okay? Must be chaos down there. We're getting by just fine. Thanks for asking. (clears throat) Oh, right, this is my partner, Harvey Bullock. Hola. Detective Bullock. Who's your little friend there? Oh, this is why I'm here. One of the women in my wing is a pagan sorceress. Of course. She's very popular. The inmates make dolls to look like people that they want to curse. And then they give it to the sorceress to curse them. In exchange for extra soda and candy. I curse you all the time. You never give me candy. I asked her if Gruber had ever given her a doll to curse, and she said yes. This is the doll. His name is Mr. M. You owe me for a double six-pack of root beer. Mr. M.? Mr. M. Mr. M. Who does this look like to you? Maroni : I tell this guy, I said, "Maurice...  we've pulled out half your freaking teeth. What the hell are you waiting for? The tooth fairy?" Right? (laughter) (cell phone buzzes) So, what he does... you know what Maurice does? He smiles at me. So I say, "I'm gonna take out another one, man." I go to his molar. I got to get Mario and Gabe to help me pull it out. Do excuse me. Right. So, we're, like, pulling it, we're pulling it, right? And finally we get it out. The thing is this big... Yes. Falcone : Come see me. I need you. I'm on my way. What's wrong? Somebody took Liza. Come, quickly. You sly devil. You took her. You're mine now. So I'm trying to tell this guy, "Let him talk." Because now he's trying to talk, but now I don't understand him 'cause he's got no teeth, right? (laughing) So I'm saying, "Let him talk. Clean him out. He's gonna tell us something." Don Maroni, sir, forgive me. Such fun we're having. But I regret that I must run away. If you'll let me. My mother is sick. Well, a sick mother's a sick mother. Go. Hey... Penguin, you all right? Whoa. Hey, kid, what are you...? What's going on here? Get down! (coughing) Maroni : I don't know what happened. It was like a silent bomb. You know who did this, right? Who? A few years ago, Jack Buchinsky and partners unknown knocked over four banks. Killed six people. Buchinsky went down for life. His partners were never caught. You're one of those partners. (chuckles) The one that took his share and sold him up the river, I expect. What guy was this? Bu... uh... Who? While he's out there looking to hurt you, he doesn't care who else he hurts. Women, kids. Hey. That's not my fault. Help me do the right thing here, Don Maroni. Let me place you in protective custody. Protective custody? Yes. Bait, you mean. We catch our bad guy, you get rid of a dangerous nuisance. We both come out ahead. Excuse me. Hello? I... must be going. Very urgent business. W-W-With Falcone. All right, make yourself at home. Hey, sweetheart. Get me a double espresso. Extra sugar. Nah. 
 
 (rings doorbell) I'm Barbara. Barbara Kean. My parents, they live here. It's very nice to see you, Barbara. Isn't it, Everett? (sighs) Yes, very nice. It's nice to see you, too. You've been well, I hope? Yes. And you? Splendid. Are you staying the night? Uh, if that's all right. In fact, um... I-I thought maybe I could stay a few days. If that's... Oh, I see. Yes, of course. I'm sure you're going to be frightfully bored. But stay until the weekend. By all means. Thank you. How's that young man of yours? James? The policeman? All well, I hope? Yes. He's well, thank you. Good. We're very happy. Very happy. (men laughing) You guys are, like, hungry for this. What do you guys do here for excitement? Remember that joke about the, uh, what is it? The two cops and the undertaker that go on a fishing boat. When you use a tethered goat as bait, shouldn't the goat be out in the jungle and not in the house? This house is the best-defended spot in Gotham. Buchinsky is crazy and arrogant and resourceful. Wherever Maroni is, he'll come after him. He'll enjoy the challenge. (indistinct chatter) (gasps) Hey, there. Hi... hi, boss. How long have I been unconscious? Couple of hours. Oh, my gosh. I-I must go. My-my poor mother... Your mother can wait. (quiet gasp) It's her heart, poor thing. Valves. She-she might be taken at any moment... But... but, by all means, of course, she can wait. When you woke up before, you said you had urgent business... with Falcone. I did? I said that? Did I? (phone ringing) Mooney : Carmine? Some people have called me about your girl Liza. They want me to help make a deal. I didn't think it was going to be you. I'm sorry. I'm just an intermediary. I just want to help. Please, my dear. Stop. I know this is you. Be honest. It's me. Of course it is. How long have I known you? You're the smart one in the family. Didn't I always say so? She won't be hurt. Leave Gotham. That's all... leave Gotham, never come back. You can take her with you. Agreed. That's the right decision. I'll make the arrangements. You were always my favorite. Wait for my call. Gilzean : He's leaving? You did it? (laughing) Boss? The genius! The-the vision! You brought down the old man... finally. Let's celebrate. Butch, this is not the time to celebrate. He was a great man once. You don't think somebody would take him out if he stayed on? I am doing him a favor and giving him an easy way out. I owe him at least that. Of course. You're right. It's best for everyone. Liza : How did he sound? Sad. Look at me. Is there something you're not telling me? No. You're going to have to leave town with him, string him along for a while. Do you think you can do that? Sure. Sure. But you like him, though, don't you? Well, I can like him, can't I? He's been a perfect gentleman. He could've done anything, and he never laid a hand on me. Liza, you can like him all you want. But you can never tell him the truth. I know that. Sir? Let me go to work. No. "No"? If Fish and the others... And there must be others... If they all want me to step away so badly, maybe it's time. Why not? Why am I still here fighting? For what? For respect. You're Don Carmine Falcone. "Respect"? Who cares? They all want me to go live in the country with Liza. I would like that. That's what I want, too. So, why not do it? Please... don't talk that way, sir. (laughs) And just me on my own? I can take out Fish's crew easy. You're not listening, Victor. Your job is to keep me and Liza safe through the coming transaction. That's all. Yes, sir. Miss Kringle? (gasps) What?! What? The cupcake is sweet, the bullet is deadly. A beautiful woman's a dangerous thing. Um, uh, listen, I, uh... That is so... I don't... I don't even know what to say to that. Nygma, you perv, back off. Can't you see the lady doesn't want you bugging her? Nygma : I, um... Hey, there. Hey, now. Who's bugging who? I'm just, I'm just... What's green and then red? Frogs in a blender. (laughs) Walk away, Nygma. Walk away. I'm very sorry if I've offended you, Miss Kringle. That was not my intention. (rumbling nearby) Do you hear that? Go. Thank you. He is so weird. Oswald : I have no business with Falcone! I swear on my mother's life! May God strike her dead with horrible torment if I'm lying! Okay, then, my friend. I'm sorry I doubted you. Go see your mom. Give her a kiss for me. (shuddering): Thank you. (men and women clamoring) (all yelling, clamoring) Ah. There's the one. Under that funny-looking fellow there. (grunts) Take him to the truck. They didn't cook. Just stunned. I expected more... oomph! You want "oomph," Jack? Ah. Officer Gordon. Nice shoes. Detective Gordon. Hands up, both of you. Uh, you might want to drop that. Aah! (grunting) Why fight me, Gordon? Who here deserves your protection? Any of them? All of them. Even Maroni?! Please! Just let me kill this false friend and get on with my life. (both grunting) All this fight. And for what? I'm putting you back in Arkham, Jack. That's closer to the mark, now, isn't it, Jim? You need to win. Don't you? You pretend to care about the law, but in your heart, it's all primitive ego. And you lust for blood and power. You just hate to lose. You know what? You're right. (sputters, whirrs) I do hate to lose. (cup clatters on ground) Hmm. (reporters clamoring) Congratulations, young man. A new day. New day. Next man that tries to take away my shield... one way or another, I'm gonna make him eat it. Say again? New day, Commissioner. I hope you have some nasty pictures of him, because I bet what you said was very, very rude. I'm done being careful. You think you've been careful so far? Men like Commissioner Loeb are never gonna trust me. You think you've been careful so far? So why play nice? You think... you've been careful so far? Don't worry. I know what I'm doing. Let's go grab a beer. Now you're messing with my mind. I need something stronger than a beer. (sighs) Hush, young man. I can hear you sigh. Sorry, sir. Let him be. It's good to see you, old friend. I am so sorry it took me so long to get here. Such a day I've had... I won't even tell you. But I'm here. You were right about Fish. It's her that's taken Liza. Sir, allow me... I must tell you what I've discovered. You're not gonna want to hear this. Speak. Liza was planted on you by Fish. She belongs to Fish. This was a setup from the start. She found a girl that looked just like your mother, and trained her up... (grunts) No. I'm sorry. Prove that. How? I-I can't. I just know. You're wrong. When have I been wrong? (phone ringing) Falcone : Hello, Fish. Don Falcone. We will meet at my place. Acceptable? Yes. Is she there? Is Liza there now? Can I speak to her? No. What time? In an hour. I'll be there. (door opens) Fish. Don Falcone. How's this work? Liza is close by. All I need for you to do is sign papers... Relinquish all control of the family... And then you're both free to leave. Papers? You think papers make a don? I'm offering you a way out, Carmine. I appreciate that. Thank you. But I need to see her first. Before I sign anything, I need to know she's all right. She's fine. I need to see her. Or no deal. (clicks tongue) (door opens) (footsteps approach) Are you all right? I'm okay. How long have you known Fish Mooney? Huh? I don't. I just met her now. No. A little bird told me you and she have been friends for a while. No. Told me that she told you stuff about my mother so that I'd get all caught up in you. Because Fish knows. You know, about my mother. You know how much I loved my mother, because we talked about her all the time, you and me. Remember, Fish? Back in the day? I do. It seems as though a little bird has been making a bit of mischief. Yes. That's what I had hoped. But the truth is plain to see. I am very disappointed at my own stupidity. (door opens) (whistles) I'm sorry, Liza. Is that your name? I'm sorry you had to get mixed up in this, because I'm sure you're a... good, honest girl, really. (gasps) (choking) (crunching) No. I want these two alive for now. Lock them up someplace. Don't bother yelling for help. All your people are dead. Carmine... you have to under... I can forgive all kinds of betrayal and dishonesty. But my mother? How dare you use my sainted mother against me? That's wrong! You'll suffer for that. I need you to... Thank you, Fish. For the first time in a long time, I feel alive. I remember who I am. I remember why I'm here. Just... You can come out now. (door opens) Right, as usual, my friend. Say your good-byes quickly. Ms. Mooney has places to go. Hello, Fish. (laughing) (shower running) (shower shuts off) Hi. Dr. Thompkins. Lee. Lee. The desk sergeant said it was okay to come back here. I didn't mean to disturb you. No, no. It's okay. Something wrong? No. Um, I was in the area, and, um... my sorceress wants her doll back. Right, yeah. Is that why you're here? Yes. No. She does want her doll back, but, um... Not entirely. No. You live here? Sort of between places right now. (laughs) I don't know why I'm here. Sorry. A whim. Wait. Hey, Gordon, did you hear? There's been a big shootout at Fish Mooney's place.
