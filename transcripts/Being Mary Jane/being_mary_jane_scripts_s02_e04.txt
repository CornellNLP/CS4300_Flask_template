 Mary Jane : Previously on Being Mary Jane. 
 You have two kids by two different men, and neither one of 'em is here to pack your ungrateful behind up. 
 How is Niecy? 
 Mary Jane : She's exercising and eating healthy. 
 Amy Robach had a mammogram on live TV. 
 Kara : I think you should go through the process of freezing your eggs. 
 I'll do it. 
 Do you know where I can get a drink? 
 You know what, pick a desk. 
 I know where the cups are. 
 We should get Sheldon DeWitt on. 
 Kara : He hasn't given an interview to anybody, not print or otherwise. 
 Cameron : Hey, you remember when we used to come back here back in the day? 
 We used to destroy these wings. 
 You still come in here? 
 Nope, no reason to. 
 Hey, uh, saw that picture that you posted of Treyvion. 
 Man, he is getting big. Whoo! 
 Even got that little lopsided head like me. 
 Cameron, why am I here? 
 Thought we needed to talk. 
 Oh, I don't have anything to say. 
 I haven't heard from you in two years. 
 A year. 
 But, look, I-I really want to change that. 
 No, you mean, vis-à-vis, your mom. 
 Look, I lost my scholarship at UF. 
 So now I'm just, you know, back in the city, just, you know, seeing what's what. 
 And there's no way your parents aren't gonna send you back to Florida? 
 No. No, no, no, no. 
 Kendra's about to graduate high school, so they're just scraping up all the money to put it towards that. 
 It's just cheaper for me to stay in Georgia. 
 Well, I'm sure they'll find a way. 
 Things always work out for you, don't they? 
 Helen : Where is Niecy? 
 Bet she's out, isn't she? Hm. 
 Probably getting pregnant again. 
 She's out with a girlfriend, and I told you I agreed to babysit, Mom. 
 Helen : You only think you agreed. 
 She played you. 
 She did not play me, and please stop using PJ's old slang. 
 Child, please. 
 I got that from Kathie Lee and Hoda Kody. 
 It's Hoda Kotb. 
 That's what I said. 
 Huh. 
 Baby, stay close, okay? 
 Don't get too close to the edge. 
 What's Treyvion doing now, bouncing off the walls again? 
 Now I swear, she had him on an all-sugar diet, thinking it's a food group. 
 When are you and Niecy gonna make up? 
 Because you clearly miss her, 'cause you can't stop talking about her. 
 I haven't mentioned her once. 
 You keep bringing her up. 
 Okay, Mom. 
 But to answer your question, we'll make up when that child can learn some respect. 
 When she first moved in here, she cooked all the time. 
 Next thing I know, everybody's cooking for her. 
 Had the nerve to get smart with me when I told her to get up off the couch and take a walk around the block. 
 You are so wrong. 
 Mom, you're wrong, and you're nuts, and you need to put some extra money in the collection plate. 
 The truth won't be heard 'cause people don't want to hear it. 
 The truth is, Niecy has actually been taking really good care of herself. 
 She's exercising. 
 She's drinking water. 
 No more fried foods. 
 [chuckling] 
 To hear you tell it. 
 Auntie. 
 Lord have mercy. 
 Cameron : Hey, hey, come on. Tell me. 
 Do you remember that one year I let my hair grow out? 
 Mm-hmm. 
 You remember. 
 And then you hooked me up with the cornrows. 
 [laughs] 
 Yeah. You thought you were hard. 
 Oh, come on. 
 You told me that I looked good. 
 Yeah, well, my braids were on point, but you, on the other hand, were corny. 
 Corny! 
 Corny. 
 Me? 
 Yes. 
 Corny. 
 Yes. 
 Now I know you tripping. 
 Hey, you cool? 
 Yeah, I'm cool. 
 I just can't eat like this anymore. 
 I'm trying to do better. 
 Well, look, I'm the one that got you eating like this, so let me help you get back, all right? 
 Starting Monday, we gonna start hitting the farmer's market, start hitting the gym. 
 We gonna look good in no time. 
 "We"? 
 Cameron, there is no we. 
 There's you, and then there's me. 
 All right, listen, I-I-I get it, okay? 
 I missed out on a lot while I was at school and you was here holding it down, but listen, listen. 
 I'm back, okay? 
 And I want to be involved with Treyvion. 
 Treyvion doesn't know you. 
 You left. 
 All right, look, don't start with this again. 
 You can't just pick up where you left off. 
 It doesn't work like that. 
 All right. 
 So what are you-- what are you saying? 
 I'm saying that I'm very clear about where we stand, and you don't need to try to get at me, because this isn't about us. 
 This is about our son. 
 All right, cool. 
 I'm glad we're being honest, because I thought that I had to get in good with you so that I could see Treyvion. 
 Well, you don't. 
 All right, cool. 
 But it is--it is good to see you again. 
 You look good.

 Hi. 
 Hi, hi. 
 Gosh, you're early. 
 Quiet night. 
 My supervisor let me sneak out, so. 
 But you don't have to do too much tonight. 
 I fed her and bathed her, and she just go on fell asleep. 
 So-- 
 You let her fall asleep? 
 But she is on a new schedule. 
 Niecy didn't tell me. 
 I'm sorry. I thought babies needed sleep. 
 If it's a problem, you know, she can just stay here with me. 
 Oh, no, no, no. 
 Thank you. 
 I want my time too. 
 Isabelle needs to know both sides of her family. 
 I agree. I agree. 
 So how's Dante doing? 
 My son is staying with my brother for now. 
 Yeah, Niecy told me. 
 I hope the Philippines can fix him. 
 I did not come to this country to be poor, did I? 
 Did you know he got another girl pregnant? 
 She's due in two months. 
 Niecy did mention that. 
 Guess Isabelle has another sibling. 
 This is no way to bring a child into this world. 
 Whatever happened to love, then marriage, then babies? 
 Huh? People don't take time to do things the right way. 
 Sometimes you can't control how things happen. 
 Yes, you can. 
 It's called abstinence. 
 Let's see if we can get you back on your schedule, huh? 
 Bye-bye, Belle. 
 Bye-bye, Belle. 
 Bye. 
 Oh, no, no, no, baby. 
 Not you. Not you. 
 I'm sorry. Wait, wait. I know. 
 I know. I know. 
 But we're gonna do something fun now. 
 What do you want to do? Whatever you want to do. 
 What do you want to do? 
 No, I'm not a fan of Mary Jane Paul. 
 She's kind of arrogant. 
 She doesn't report the facts-- more her opinion-- and she thinks this is a fashion show. 
 I don't know. 
 She's just not relatable, and I don't see myself in any of her stories. 
 Mm-hmm. 
 Yeah, me either. 
 What the hell is this? 
 We're conducting focus groups in key demos on all our shows. 
 This one's in Las Vegas. 
 Don't worry. It's not all bad. 
 But we only do this when there's a problem. 
 Not necessarily. 
 So far, Mark's show is in good shape. 
 He's built a strong male audience, thanks to you. 
 Okay. 
 And Cynthia still has the strongest female viewership. 
 What about Mary Jane? 
 What exactly are you trying to figure out here, Greg? 
 Bottom line, our demos are lowest with Hispanic viewers, and with the presidential election coming up, we need to shore up that market. 
 Now, they were a major part in the 2012 election. 
 It's gonna be even bigger in 2016. 
 You know what, we have got to stop chasing these trends. 
 Whatever happened to reporting great news and trusting that our audience is gonna stick with us? 
 Everybody loves Mary Jane, and her numbers are steady. 
 Steady... 
 Yes. 
 But not rising. 
 And she has the biggest contract of a lot of other talent. 
 Oh, come on. 
 It's not me, Kara. 
 It's coming from marketing and ad sales. 
 Well, what are you saying? 
 That if she doesn't test well, she might lose her time slot or her job altogether? 
 I want Mary Jane here just as much as you do, but nothing can be done until all the data is in. 
 Plus, it would just get her worked up over what could be nothing. 
 Oh, no, no, no, no. 
 It would show on the air, and that would not help her. 
 Are you actually suggesting that I keep this from her? 
 Really? 
 I'm expecting you to. 
 Oh. 
 There is nothing to tell her. 
 Then why are you telling me this, Greg? 
 Well, maybe we can help her with the demos, but this information was given to you in confidence. 
 I expect it to stay in confidence. 
 This is wrong. 
 Really, just... 
 Gael, what are you doing here? 
 Lunch, remember? 
 I didn't see you downstairs, so I came up. 
 Well, you should've called 'cause today is a crazy day. 
 Oh. This might help. 
 Oh. 
 We finished off your bottle, so I wanted to replace it. 
 Well, you didn't have to do that, but thank you. 
 I can't do lunch, but I can do dinner tomorrow night. 
 Do you have a minute? 
 Hey, yeah, sure. 
 Mary Jane, this is Gael. 
 Gael, Mary Jane. 
 Oh, I heard great things. 
 You as well. 
 I--I appreciate how you keep immigration reform front and center. 
 And that Vargas piece, that was a refreshing perspective on a subject that's very close to me. 
 Well, you know with the election coming up, we will be covering immigration reform quite a bit, so please keep watching. 
 Definitely. 
 I will. 
 Yep. Yep, yep, yep, yep. 
 Listen, we really have to get back to it. 
 So I-I'm sorry that, you know, I can't do lunch. 
 Do you want to do dinner tomorrow? 
 Absolutely. 
 Okay. Nice to meet you. 
 Yeah. 
 Oh, pleasure's all mine. 
 Bye. 
 Bye. 
 Girl, you got a good one. 
 Did you really need me, or were you just being nosy? 
 Nosy. 
 Mm. 
 Oh, my God. 
 Oh! 
 Auntie! Oh, my God. 
 Oh, my God, I'm so sorry. 
 I'm so sorry. 
 I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry. 
 Who-who is that? 
 It's-it's-it's-it's Treyvion's father. 
 Oh. 
 It's Treyvion's dad. 
 Niecy : What are you doing? Get up! Get the hell up. 
 My clothes-- My clothes are over there. 
 Oh, my God. I'm so sorry. 
 Oh, God. Where is Treyvion? 
 He's--he's--he's with Naima and the--and--and the girls. 
 I'm sorry, Auntie. 
 I'm sorry. 
 I'm sorry too. 
 You had all the good stuff recorded on your DVR. 
 We didn't even get under the covers. 
 We just laid on top of the blanket. 
 The duvet is the most expensive part. 
 I'm sorry, Auntie. 
 I...

 Dang, those hormones still got you up? 
 Yeah, that and I don't want to sleep in my bed. 
 Are you gonna kick us out? 
 No, I'm not gonna kick you out. 
 Thank you so much, Auntie. 
 And, look, I am so sorry about everything. 
 And I promise that I will never disrespect your house like that again. 
 Thank you. 
 Are you tired of being sorry and making promises that are hard for you to keep? 
 Auntie, I made a mistake. 
 I know. You're always making mistakes. 
 My question is, are you tired of it? 
 'Cause here I am thinking, "Wow, Niecy is really getting her life together," and then you go and pull a stunt like that. 
 But it's not like it was somebody random. 
 It was Treyvion's father. 
 We're using that term "father" pretty loosely. 
 Baby, you are never going to attract more than how you feel about yourself. 
 You're always trying to be deep. 
 Look, Cameron's back. 
 He wants to be in his son's life, but he has to show me that he's serious first. 
 How? By sleeping with you? 
 I love you. 
 Baby, I do, but your life cannot revolve around a dude. 
 There's more to life than men and kids. 
 Like what, freezing your eggs and drinking tequila? 
 Excuse me, little girl? 
 Oh, no, you made it very clear that I'm a big girl. 
 And since we're talking truth, let's talk about the empty tequila bottles that I found under your bathroom sink. 
 Wait, wait. You've been snooping around my house? 
 I was looking for lotion. 
 Ain't this about a blimp? 
 You used Treyvion to get Cameron to come over here, and I call you on it, and now you're trying to come at me sideways over a drink? 
 So you can critique me on everything--everything! 
 But I can't say anything about the fact that you drink all the time and by yourself? 
 I don't have to answer to you, Niecy. 
 I'm a grown-ass woman. 
 Yeah, and you're twice my age, and you have to sneak around your own house hiding alcohol. 
 Is that what grown women do? 
 No, grown women have jobs. 
 Contrary to the belief of-- of the blogs and reality shows, being a baby mama is not a career! 
 I'm taking care of my kids. 
 No, I am taking care of your kids! 
 You have no job, no skills, and two mouths to feed. 
 You show up at my doorstep, and you're surprised that I'm drinking? 
 Oh, baby, you're lucky that's all I'm doing living with your ungrateful ass. 
 You think I want to live here? 
 I hate it here. 
 Really? 
 Yes. 
 'Cause the sad thing is, there ain't nothing you can do to change it.

 You got a lot to say for somebody who's never paid a bill. 
 Pay a bill, and then you get to have opinions. 
 Hey, hey, hey, enough. Wait, wait, wait. 
 You both are acting like children up in here. 
 No, no, no. I tried to make it work, Dad. 
 I cannot raise three children. 
 Yeah, 'cause you're too busy throwing back them tequila shots. 
 No, no, that's a lie. That is a lie. 
 It's not. 
 Wait, are you-- you're drinking? 
 She has empty tequila bottles under her sink. 
 Wait, what are-- you're tattling on me? 
 I can show you. I'll show you. 
 Oh, wait. Oh, you want to show him something? 
 Show him the place where I caught you having s*x in my bedroom. 
 You did what? 
 Yeah. 
 Can we just go? Look at her. 
 Oh, now you want to go? 
 Look at her. 
 What are you gonna do? 
 Just bounce around from house to house? 
 You still owe your grandmother an apology. 
 I'm willing to take my chances. 
 It's better than being stuck here with you dragging-- 
 Enough! 
 What the hell has this family gone to? 
 We don't act like that! 
 Neither one of you were raised that way. 
 Little girl, this is your auntie here. 
 You will speak to here with respect. 
 Thank you. 
 I realize you're stressing over work, but you do not take it out on your family. 
 Mm-hmm. 
 And if you're drinking too much, stop it. 
 Niecy, get your things and take Treyvion to the car. 
 Let's go. 
 Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. 
 I don't mind if you leave, but you're not gonna leave here thinking that I have a drinking problem. 
 Oh, no. 
 No. 
 Yes, she found bottles under my sink in the bathroom because I was trying to be respectful of her children in my house. 
 Yes, I have a drink after work to relax me, no different than you used to have a drink every night after work, when you'd pour yourself a scotch. 
 Yes, I drink tequila because my mind races at night, and I need to turn it off so I can get some rest, to get up early, to go to work. 
 You know, work? Oh, no, you-- you don't know about that. 
 Not to mention I have to be camera ready. Yes. 
 I drink because I'm a responsible adult, who doesn't need to explain it to her father, because her ungrateful niece is so mad about her life that she's got to knock me down a peg to make everyone think that she's doing okay when she's not. 
 Now you can leave. 
 Bye. 
 Pay a bill on your way out.

 [exhales] 
 I hope you don't mind me just dropping by. 
 No, no, not at all. 
 This happens all the time. 
 I don't know why I just said that. 
 This doesn't happen all the time. 
 People like you don't just drop by. 
 Truth is securing an interview with you would be huge for me. 
 So do I mind that you're here? 
 Of course not, but a heads-up would've been nice. 
 Well, in my experience, the occasional surprise visit allows one to see who we really are. 
 It strips away our pretentious tendencies. 
 You said occasional. 
 As in, this may happen again? 
 Everyone knows that you don't give interviews. 
 You have never said why. 
 Off the record? 
 Off the record. 
 I prefer the doing. 
 I do the work. I let other people talk about it. 
 Oh, and they do. 
 People speculate about your success, the cases you've won, your scruples as a businessman. 
 If people want to waste their time thinking about me, I have no problem with it. 
 So what made you change your mind about the interview? 
 I mean, I'm assuming you're here for a reason. 
 Well, really, it started with the Gifting Alliance. 
 Like interviews, I had resisted the invitation for years. 
 But I do want to give back. 
 I was meditating this morning, and I came upon the realization that asking the wealthy to help my people was tantamount to passing out fish. 
 I want my people to fish. 
 You know, for so long, I was just fine with being the only one. 
 Success in isolation fosters the-- the lie of, "I'm special." 
 I know you must know what I'm talking about. 
 I would love to go there with you, but there are a lot of black women in my field. 
 I'm not special. 
 And just as you've pointed out, neither are you. 
 What I did do was put all of my energy into making myself successful. 
 But I didn't leave behind the playbook. 
 Your show targets a lot of the audience that I'm trying to reach, and ten minutes of airtime could be a very powerful thing when you finally have something to say. 
 Yeah. 
 It's great that you have an agenda and that you're interested in that platform. 
 But, Mr. DeWitt, Talk Back isn't a messenger service. 
 We can't cover those issues without addressing Sheldon DeWitt the man. 
 People want to know more about your personal life, your work. 
 Just so we're clear, this is just the vetting process. 
 Oh. 
 Before I agree to sit down with you, I just want to see what you're all about. 
 Since we're being up-front, I would love to get an interview with you. 
 I might even make some compromises, but not to the point where I feel like I'm being used. 
 Uh-oh, I may need the number of one of those not-so-special black female anchors. 
 Hm. 
 Mary Jane : This is what we call the news pit. 
 It's--it's kind of quiet this time of night. 
 Sheldon : Yeah, it's not exactly what you'd imagine of your 24-hour news station. 
 Yeah. 
 To the right is our control room. 
 So you've been here for three years? 
 Gosh, has it been that long? 
 Yeah. Yeah, I guess it has. 
 And now you're in the process of freezing your eggs. 
 Well, somebody's been watching my show. 
 Mm-hmm. 
 Yeah, uh, sort of felt like the right time. 
 How's that? 
 Like you, I've kind of had tunnel vision when it came to my career. 
 This job has been my long-term relationship. 
 Oh. 
 One day I woke up, and I wanted more. 
 I wanted marriage and kids and the whole happy cliché. 
 Family dog, white picket fence. 
 Well, I had thought more of a sculptural fence, but, yeah, I'm open. 
 Mm. 
 But putting out there for everyone to see, that's a risky move. 
 What's life without risks? 
 True, but I usually reserve the risks for my business. 
 I'm a bit more careful with my private life. 
 Well, yeah, no, I-- 
 I wasn't sold on the whole egg freezing thing. 
 My producer had to sell me on it. 
 But the support has been tremendous, and it's been an incredible journey. 
 The only downside is the insomnia. 
 Oh, in my book, insomnia's a bonus. 
 Business never sleeps. 
 Why should we? 
 I don't know about you. 
 But I look a lot better with some sleep. 
 If this is you without sleep, I'm not complaining. 
 This is the top back set, and this is where you will sit when you do the interview. 
 If I do the interview. 
 [knocking] 
 Yee-haw. 
 [laughs] Yee-haw. 
 Come in. 
 Dinner's ready. 
 We're not really hungry. 
 We already ate.

 Paul Sr. : You knew I was gonna pick her up last night. 
 And you knew how I felt about it. 
 She's lucky she has those kids or her behind-- she wouldn't be here. 
 You won, okay. 
 All right. 
 All right, thank you. 
 Paul Sr. : You know that girl is in her room hiding? 
 Say, "Thank you, Grandpa." 
 Paul Sr. : Helen, this has got to stop. 
 You know, I'm tired of this foolishness. 
 You win, okay? 
 Okay, these are the numbers that I need the calculations for. 
 Okay. 
 Okay? Tomorrow's show. 
 Yeah. 
 Kara. 
 So let--yeah? 
 Oh, yeah. I'll be right back. 
 Yeah. 
 Kara : Yeah? 
 I need your help. 
 Oh. 
 We shooting up at the office now? 
 Yeah, I tried to do it myself, and I got all freaked out. 
 So go ahead. 
 All right, just tell me where. 
 Just right here, and just--ow! Mother-- 
 I'm sorry. 
 I'm sorry, but you just got to do it. 
 My mom has type one. 
 Been doing daily shots since I'm nine. 
 I used to have to give 'em to her, and it used to scare the crap out of me. 
 But now needles don't faze me. 
 Clearly. 
 You're gonna be okay. 
 What are you gonna do tonight? 
 What else am I gonna do? Work. 
 Don't say it like you don't love it. 
 Something to do, girl. 
 I want to have a drink. 
 But, you know, with the shots and everything-- want to get something to eat? 
 Yeah, sure. 
 I--let me just finish up-- oh, shoot! 
 What? 
 I was supposed to meet Gael for dinner tonight. 
 What time? 
 Like, five minutes ago. 
 Oh, my gosh. I'm gonna-- 
 I'm just gonna cancel. 
 No, no. 
 You're not gonna cancel. 
 Yes. Yes. 
 You just bailed on him for lunch yesterday. 
 Now you're gonna text him that you're on your way. 
 You got to go. 
 Yeah, I guess I should. 
 All right. 
 Wait, wait, wait. Wait. 
 What? 
 Let me check your teeth. 
 All right. Boobs. 
 They're still there. 
 Protection? 
 I am not sleeping with him tonight. 
 Girl, please. 
 What? 
 You slutty ass. 
 Mm-hmm. You took it. 
 What's that make you? 
 [laughs]

 Hi. 
 Hi. 
 I'm meeting Gael Montoya here. 
 He's right over there. 
 Back here? 
 Yeah. 
 Thank you so much. 
 Kara : Oh, my gosh. 
 Where is he? Where is he? 
 Oh, my gosh, I am so sorry. 
 Oh, my goodness. 
 I am so sorry--work stuff. 
 Oh. But you got my text, right? 
 I did. 
 Oh, goodness gracious. Craziness. 
 I just didn't know that running 15 minutes late really meant 45. 
 I'm sorry. I know. 
 Your drink is probably watered down. 
 Oh. Thank you. 
 Listen, I just want to apologize for not being myself the other day. 
 I was just very stressed out, and you kind of caught me off guard when you just popped up at my job. 
 No, we had plans. 
 Well, they weren't set in stone. 
 You had my name on a list with security. 
 How do you think I got into the building? 
 Yeah, but you saw how busy I was, and instead of leaving, you decided to stand there and fawn all over my coworker saying how much you loved our immigration story. 
 I was just giving her a compliment. 
 Aye. 
 Did you not produce that show? 
 I've produced thousands of shows, Gael, but, of course, you would choose that one. 
 I get it. You're a proud Latino. 
 Congratulations. 
 What is that supposed to mean? 
 Nothing. 
 Nothing. 
 I think the kitchen is going to close soon. 
 Do you want to order something to eat, something else to drink? 
 Can you just get the sarcasm out of your voice, please? 
 Please? 
 I'm simply stating fact. 
 The place is about to close. 
 I had to work. 
 You could've texted. 
 I did text you. 
 I mean, when you knew you were going to be another 30 minutes, you could've let me know. 
 You know what, I don't need this. 
 I really don't. 
 I don't need any more guilt in my life. 
 If it's not my kids, it's my job. 
 If it's not the dog, it's my ex. 
 And I'm certainly not going to add you to my plate. 
 I'm sorry. 
 I have to go. 
 Thank you. 
 Let's make your cranberry a real drink. 
 Oh, no, no, no. You know, I shouldn't. 
 Maybe you haven't heard. I'm freezing my eggs. 
 Okay. 
 So... 
 Everybody's excited about your little special guest. 
 So what's he like? 
 Surprisingly cool. 
 Mm-hmm. 
 Easy to talk to, and I can't believe he is 52, never been married, and has no kids. 
 Hm. Think he's playing for my team? 
 If he is, he's batting well over 500. 
 [laughs] That's all good. 
 He's definitely handsome. 
 Definitely handsome, but the kind of money he's making? 
 Oh, yes, he is gorgeous, girl. 
 Maybe I can introduce you. 
 Get you back in the game, huh? 
 I don't know. 
 Oh, too soon. I'm sorry. 
 Yeah. 
 I'm sorry. Gosh. 
 Why, why? Why are you sorry? 
 I feel bad. 
 I feel like I just cheated on Eric. 
 How's that going, by the way? 
 [sighs] 
 I feel guilty. You know? 
 He asked me not to call. 
 He went to his brother's so he could spend some time with his nephews. 
 No, it's funny because he always thought I was gonna leave him for a black man, but I really never connected with the right one. 
 Who you telling? 
 [chuckling] 
 That's partially why he was jealous of you. 
 You always got where I was coming from. 
 He kind of felt like an outsider. 
 Well, I'm surprised marriage rates are as high as they are, given how difficult it is for people to just really connect. 
 That's exactly why the divorce rates are equally as high too. 
 Right. 
 So how are you? 
 Lately, somewhere between okay and totally lost and happy I have a damn job to distract me. 
 Oh, amen to that. 
 Wow. You know what. 
 It is getting late. 
 Not that I have anyone to go home to, but isn't that sometimes the best? 
 No. 
 How do you figure? You're home alone. 
 You're by yourself. 
 Are you kidding me? 
 Sometimes. 
 Never. Never. 
 That's--

 Hello? 
 I won't do a live interview. 
 Sheldon : It'd have to be taped at my office if I decide to move forward with you. 
 I--I'm happy to discuss that arrangement, but do you know what time it is? 
 You said you don't sleep. 
 True, but this is crossing the line. 
 So if you want to reach me, let's figure out a more appropriate hour. 
 Duly noted.
