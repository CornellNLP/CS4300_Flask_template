 Previously on The L Word: Generation Q I scheduled us a tour of the Biltmore. 
  I don't want to feel uncomfortable at my own wedding. 
  Couples compromise all the time. 
  Yeah, I'm happy to compromise with you. 
  I'm just not about to compromise with your dad. 
  Jordi, I didn't know you were coming. 
  You have a really wonderful daughter, and I love spending time with her. 
  Okay, so remember this morning when you were wondering if I could get over the whole priest thing? 
  Oh, I can because you're not a real priest. 
  Not there. 
  - What's that? 
  - Divorce papers. 
  I know that there's something going on between the two of you. 
  I can feel it. 
  [MOANING] 
  - I'm sorry. 
  I - Don't touch me. 
  I need to get out of here. 
  [TYLER] 
  Prior to running for office, you were the Director of Cultural Affairs. 
  - That's correct. 
  - Do you remember f*cking my wife? 
  [DANI] 
  You've jeopardized the campaign. 
  [BETTE] 
  I am painfully aware of that fact. 
  [DANI] 
  You can be with her, or you can stay in this race and fight for what you believe in. 
  But you can't have it both ways. 
  Is there a part of you that still wants her? 
  You can tell me. 
  [NAT] 
  I want you and her. 
  [ALICE] 
  Holy sh1t. 
  Oh, my God.

  Okay? 
  I want to be with you. 
  [SIGHS] 
  Q, I can't. 
  I can't. 
  I'm not asking you to be a parent. 
  It's my dream, not yours. 
  All I'm asking is for you to be my partner. 
  Well, then, well, tell me what that looks like. 
  We've never been traditional about anything, right? 
  - Yeah. 
  - Exactly. 
  Because I see you. 
  I know you. 
  I know your heart. 
  I don't want to go through this world without you. 
  - Jesus, Q, not today.

  Don't do that. 
  It's me. 
  Remember? 
  You don't scare me.

  Does she know that you signed the papers? 
  Oh, she knows. 
  But she knows you don't want kids, so I don't understand what changed. 
  She says she wants to be with me, but she doesn't need me to raise her kid. 
  - What does that even mean?

  Nope, not a joke. 
  [CHUCKLES] 
  - You're wasting my time. 
  - [BETTE] 
  Wouldn't it be nice if we didn't have to weigh the consequences of every decision we make? 
  I'm gonna have to ask you to stop yelling at me, ma'am. 
  [WOMAN]

  My God, that would be nice. 
  I just I want to know when it got so hard.

  Everybody thinks I'm gonna give them something for free. 
  All the time. 
  You'll make the right choice. 
  - I hope so.

  Eh, I don't really remember anything, but sure. 
  Mm-hmm.

  - Mm-hmm. 
  I've been there. 
  - Really? 
  - Oh, my God, yes.

  It's my mom. 
  Tell me your mom's not hot and I'll believe you. 
  - Okay, she's super hot. 
  - [LAUGHS] 
  Seeing that wine makes me want to puke. 
  Yeah, I think we all had plenty to drink last night. 
  Yeah, so, about last night. 
  Do you guys want to talk about it, or No? 
  I mean, it's fine either way. 
  - I'm just curious. 
  - We had a threesome. 
  I think we should just leave it at that. 
  Just - Yeah. 
  - Okay. 
  [ALICE] 
  Okay. 
  And is it something you'd want to maybe do again? 
  - Or - Alice. 
  That's what Steve and Amir do. 
  - [NAT] 
  No, they don't. 
  - Sometimes they add Nick. 
  That's very different. 
  Okay, I don't know who these people are, but I love to know that other people are doing this. 
  - Oh, for sure. 
  - Yeah. 
  'Cause I thought last night was great. 
  I thought so, too. 
  - But you're my ex-wife. 
  - I know that. 
  - She's my ex-wife. 
  - [ALICE] 
  Yeah. 
  - I-I know that, also. 
  - And I love you. 
  I love you, too. 
  - I love her. 
  - Of course. 
  And I don't want anything to get in the way of what we have. 
  No. 
  No. 
  Never. 
  Neither would I. 
  - Is that really true? 
  - Yes. 
  Nat, it took us two years to be okay with one another. 
  I-I want you to be happy. 
  I-I don't want to lose you again. 
  You didn't lose me, Gigi. 
  You cheated on me. 
  - Big difference. 
  - You're Yes, and I am so sorry. 
  - Are you? 
  - Yes! 
  How else do you want me to show you how sorry I am? 
  This was a mistake. 
  - Mistake. 
  - O-Okay. 
  - That's fine. 
  - [NAT] 
  Yeah. 
  We can just pretend like it never happened. 
  - Totally. 
  - I can do that. 
  You know, why are you so willing to get in on this? 
  Because I would do anything - to have you - This is so messy. 
  It doesn't have to be. 
  You really hurt me. 
  I know. 
  And I loved you so much. 
  I loved you, too. 
  And I never thought that I was gonna get over you. 
  And then I found someone and I found someone really great and somehow, you're still here. 
  So how is it that you get to f*ck everything up and still have everything, always? 
  What do you want? 
  I'll do anything. 
  Do you want me to leave? 
  I'll leave. 
  No. 
  [ALICE]

  Dani, listen to me. 
  Look, you don't have to freak out. 
  We can just talk to him. 
  He's still your dad, all right? 
  Just chill. 
  All right? 
  [INDISTINCT CHATTER] 
  What the hell is wrong with you? 
  - Dani, calm down. 
  - What's going on? 
  You were just gonna slip in that biological parent clause? 
  Everything is up for discussion. 
  If Sophie gives birth, that kid will be mine. 
  Daniella, if you were a man Do not finish that sentence. 
  I am telling you, don't. 
  - I'm trying to protect you. 
  - How? 
  How are you trying to protect me? 
  The lawyer said that clause was just standard. 
  Is it standard for straight people, too? 
  No. 
  I'm trying to do what's best for my family. 
  She is your family. 
  Our kids will be your family. 
  Why is it so f*cking hard for you to see that? 
  [LAUGHS SOFTLY] 
  I don't know what's going on here, but the daughter I raised would never talk to me like this. 
  - What are you saying? 
  - The daughter I raised would [QUIETLY] 
  would be grateful for the life she's been given. 
  Of course she's grateful. 
  She loves you. 
  You don't see that? 
  SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC There's not going to be a prenup. 
  Have I made myself clear? 
  Let's go. 
  We're not done discussing this. 
  - f*ck you. 
  - Hey!

  - Hey! 
  Hey, Tess. 
  Did we miss a liquor delivery? 
  Yes. 
  But it's fine. 
  There's plenty left over from your party last night. 
  [SIGHS] 
  That's not the point. 
  You're supposed to be on top of this. 
  Okay. 
  Can I trust you to run this place? 
  [CHUCKLES] 
  Oh. 
  Oh, that's funny. 
  - Why? 
  - You f*cked my girlfriend and you want to know if you can trust me? 
  You're right. 
  [CLEARS THROAT] 
  Tess, that was my fault and I should've known better. 
  Yeah. 
  I'm sorry. 
  I hope I can make it up to you one day. 
  Okay. 
  - Is she here? 
  - Who? 
  - Lena. 
  - She took off. 
  Great. 
  Finley's gonna cover for her tonight. 
  - Ugh, that's a terrible idea. 
  - Well, she's all we've got. 
  All right, then-then, you need to keep an eye on her. 
  Sure thing, boss. 
  SOMBER MUSIC [SIGHS] 
  Yeah, of course. 
  I I guess I just want to say that I'm sorry. 
  For coming over drunk. 
  Two words for you: open bar. 
  Yeah, so I'm not angry that you came over drunk. 
  - Okay, well, that's good. 
  - Yeah. 
  Uh, do you remember what you said to me? 
  No. 
  But So, you told me that you don't think I'm a real priest and then you told me that you are in love with me. 
  [EXHALES] 
  So, how are you feeling about those two things today? 
  [MOANS SOFTLY] 
  You're not ready. 
  For what? 
  Oh, sweet girl, you have so much you haven't dealt with. 
  [SIGHS] 
  [MOANS] 
  I want to be better. 
  And you make me want to be better. 
  I was with a guy once, and I stayed with him for way too long because I was waiting for him to change. 
  And he said, "Stop trying to fix me". 
  And he was right. 
  You can't fix people. 
  Wait a second. 
  Am I the first girl you've ever been with? 
  - No. 
  - [LAUGHS SOFTLY] 
  Did you hear anything that I just said? 
  Yes. 
  Yeah, I did.
