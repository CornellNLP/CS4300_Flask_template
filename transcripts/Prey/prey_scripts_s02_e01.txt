 We can't. 
 We have to. 
 Three more. 
 Come on. 
 Come on, Dave. 
 Push it. 
 Come on, son. 
 Fight for it! 
 (EXHALES SLOWLY) 
 Push. 
 Push, push, push! 
 (GROANS) 
 Yes. 
 Not bad, Granddad! 
 You cheeky sod. 
 (EXHALES) 
 Good workout, lads? 
 Not bad. 
 Wanna get yourself to the gym, Graham. 
 We don't go too mad. 
 You're all right, mate. 
 Don't need a six-pack. 
 You've got the full beer barrel there, Graham. 
 All right, mouth! 
 Have a nice day, lads. 
 See  you. 
 Ta-ra. 
 (BUZZER) 
 (BUZZER) 
 Fancy the Beehive later? 
 Er...no, I can't. 
 I'm busy. 
 Don't tell me you're... 
 What? 
 ..singing and bloody dancing. 
 Maybe. 
 (LAUGHS) 
 (ALARM CLOCK BUZZES) 
 (WHIMPERS) 
 (GROANS) Bloody hell, Sue. 
 (SIGHS) 
 It's the weekend. 
 (GROANS) I know... 
 (ALARM STOPS) 
 Didn't say I was getting up, though. 
 (BOTH GIGGLE) 
 You all right? 
 Mm, yeah. 
 Thought I could smell bacon. 
 Yeah, you can. 
 It's next door. 
 Oh, great! 
 There's cereal. 
 I'll get something on the way. 
 I need to get off, anyway. 
 Phil! 
 I'll see you tonight. 
 Mm. 
 What? 
 Nothing! 
 I'll see you tonight. 
 Love you. 
 Right. 
 (BOTH LAUGH) 
 You're hopeless! 
 Sure you're OK? 
 Yeah, I'm fine. 
 All right, well, I'll see you later. 
 See you later. 
 OK, Sue. 
 I'll get these tests run. 
 Try not to worry. 
 I promise, we'll get to the bottom of it. 
 (PHONE VIBRATES) 
 Excuse me. 
 (SIGHS) 
 Yes, I'm coming. 
 (SIGHS) 
 Thank you. 
 Just down there on the right side. 
 Thanks. 
 (REVS ENGINE) 
 Hiya. 
 You all right? 
 Ah. 
 Cheers, thanks. 
 Cheers. 
 All right, Sue? 
 All right, sir? 
 Wrong leg. 
 Other way round. 
 Thanks! 
 I have been dressing myself since I was 30. 
 Sarge. 
 Iddon. 
 How's lanky getting on? 
 Next Chief Super, that lad! 
 Smartest copper on the Force. 
 He must have told you. 
 I hope you missed breakfast. 
 Bloody hell. 
 I know, right? 
 Enough to put you off bacon butties for life. 
 Cause of death, besides him being a charcoal briquette? 
 It is a him? 
 Yeah. 
 I found a nice little group of stab wounds here. 
 Have we got an ID? 
 A driver's license. 
 Daniel Hope. 
 And is this his car? 
 We've run the VIN number. 
 Iddon. 
 What? 
 Are  you  on  glue? 
 It's a selfie. 
 I'm not gonna tweet it. 
 (SIGHS) Come on, you knobhead. 
 I wasn't even smiling.

 Opening at one. 
 (PHONE VIBRATES) 
 Everyone else from three. 
 Best make that 3:30. 
 And David? 
 Yeah? 
 Chorus. 
 That means you, too. 
 Yes, boss. 
 We're heading to the pub. 
 Are you coming? 
 No, I'd best not. 
 Gotta be at work at six. 
 You've got time for one. 
 Well... 
 It's all right. 
 I'll see you next week. 
 Chrissy... 
 Erm... 
 (ZIPS BAG) 
 I'll just come for the one, yeah? 
 (MUTED CHATTER AND LAUGHTER) 
 Well, how did he know? 
 Well, you tell them. 
 It's supposed to be quite common. 
 Is it stress? 
 Hey, Lucy. 
 Bloody hell, love. 
 You look like a Weeble. 
 Thanks !  Erm...hey, everybody. 
 This is our Lucy. 
 All :  Hiya. 
 I'll get us a drink. 
 Sit down, Chrissy. 
 I'll get them. 
 Don't be daft. 
 Do you want one? 
 No, thanks. 
 Thanks. 
 Didn't have to drive here. 
 I'd have met you at home. 
 Right. 
 So you are coming home, then (?) 
 Look, can we just go? 
 He's either at work or he's out. 
 I don't know where he is. 
 (CHOKED) I think he might be seeing someone, Dad. 
 (SIGHS) Oh, I don't know. 
 We had a fight. 
 (SIGHS) God. 
 What? 
 Just...all this. 
 You're starting a family. 
 That comes first. 
 I knew this'd be a mistake - 
 I'm not just having a go at you. 
 Him and all. 
 Both of you, stop being so selfish and grow up a bit. 
 You're a right one to talk! 
 What? 
 You! 
 Knocking about with that Chrissy. 
 I've known her years. 
 Yeah, I know you have! 
 We're just friends, Lucy. 
 Oh, piss off, Dad. 
 I know. 
 Mum wasn't even dead, was she? 
 That's not true. 
 How you can even think that - 
 Why do you even bother wearing that ring? 
 Eh? 
 Forget it. 
 I'll stop at a mate's. 
 Lucy...Lucy! 
 (SIGHS) 
 (CAR DOOR OPENS AND CLOSES) 
 (KEYS RATTLE) 
 (CHILDREN PLAYING IN DISTANCE) 
 (DISTANT SIREN) 
 He's not in. 
 Do you know where he is? 
 Not a clue, love. 
 "Love" (?) 
 Who are you? 
 Mr..? 
 Rizla. 
 Mr Rizla, right. 
 I've not seen him since yesterday. 
 Do you know if he took his car? 
 Yeah, I think so. 
 What's happened? 
 It was found burned out this morning. 
 How well do you know Mr Hope? 
 Dan? 
 Yeah, pretty well. 
 We're mates. 
 Do you know if he... 
 if Dan was in any trouble? 
 Sir? 
 We can nip in yours if you like. 
 Kick back. 
 Shoot the breeze. 
 Look, I don't know about any trouble, yeah? 
 But he asked me to keep an eye out, see if anyone came looking for him. 
 Seemed a bit shady. 
 Did anyone come looking for him? 
 I'm busy, though, you know. 
 Why would someone nick his car? 
 It's a pile of shite. 
 We found a body. 
 You think it's Dan? 
 If you remember anything, or if you see Mr Hope... 
 Yeah, yeah, of course. 
 (METALLIC CLANKING) 
 Whoa...you don't need that. 
 I've got his keys. 
 He asked me to feed Larry. 
 (SHOUTS) Police! 
 Thanks. 
 Police! 
 Cheers. 
 Nothing. 
 Well, I want a camera set up outside. 
 I don't trust The Dude to tell us if someone comes calling. 
 It's every couple of weeks now. 
 They have another argument. 
 She storms off. 
 Somehow, I end up being the bad guy. 
 This lad she's with? 
 Yeah, he's a dickhead. 
 You met him last Christmas. 
 Oh, aye. 
 Kid who sells cars? 
 That's the one. 
 Alan. 
 Anybody'd think he was the next Richard Branson, way he carries on. 
 You wanna send some of the lads round. 
 Give him a Burnley wallet. 
 (SUDDEN SCUFFLE) 
 Sally : Mr Crabtree! 
 (WHISTLING AND SHOUTING) 
 Move! 
 (WHISTLING) 
 Shift. 
 What happened? 
 She went down like a sack of spuds. 
 Spark out. 
 I'll call an ambulance. 
 You'll have to go with her, mate. 
 All right, you lot. 
 Stop gawping and give her some space. 
 You OK? 
 Yeah, I'm fine. 
 (PHONE VIBRATES) 
 Jesus Christ Superstar? 
 I saw that. 
 With erm... 
 What's his name? 
 Darren Day. 
 That was Joseph. 
 He was in Joseph And The Amazing Technicolor Dream Coat. 
 Oh, right. 
 Well, it were dead good. 
 You all right? 
 Yeah. 
 Apart from having a barney with my daughter. 
 Miss Hope? 
 We're ready for you. 
 Can you check in? 
 (TYPES ON PHONE) 
 (PHONE RINGS OUT) 
 We spoke to a neighbour. 
 He claims Mr Hope had been acting a bit jumpy recently, and had asked to be informed if anyone came looking for him. 
 He didn't say who? 
 Obviously not, sir, otherwise I'd be be telling you we had a suspect. 
 Right. 
 Let's find Mr Hope's next of kin. 
 Iddon's already on it. 
 Good. 
 Sue? 
 Yes, sir? 
 I know you're annoyed that I got this job and you didn't, but it's happened now, and if you're planning on staying, I need your respect. 
 All right? 
 (IDDON LAUGHING) 
 Right, who's got 'em? 
 Got what? 
 Guys, this isn't even funny. 
 Are you busy? 
 A word? 
 Dickhead. 
 Where's he put them? 
 (LAUGHTER) 
 Have you got my background report? 
 Yeah, Dan Hope. 
 Only family's his sister, Julie, doing a stretch up at Ravenhill. 
 They grew up in foster care together, over in Blackpool. 
 Grow up. 
 Give him his drawer keys back and stop messing around. 
 Come on, Sue. 
 We're having a laugh. 
 Enough with the "Sue", all right? 
 It is boss or Sergeant to you, or Mrs Bloody Reinhardt. 
 All right, Sue. 
 Boss. 
 Don't push it, Richard. 
 Get on to Ravenhill, make us an appointment. 
 We need to speak to Dan Hope's sister. 
 Have you got a problem with that? 
 Good. 
 (CT SCANNER WHIRRS) 
 (PHONE VIBRATES) 
 Do they know what's wrong with her? 
 They think it might be er... 
 (VIBRATING STOPS) 
 ..some kind of anaemia. 
 Might be something wrong with her kidneys, they're not sure. 
 She's nearly done. 
 Thanks, love. 
 Right, I'll just nip to the loo, then. 
 OK. 
 OK, Jules. 
 This is done now. 
 (PHONE VIBRATES) 
 Luce, I really don't want another row, love. 
 '(SOBBING) Dad? 
 Dad, please don't hang up.' 
 I'm at work. 
 'I know where you are. 
 You're at the hospital. 
 Dad, you need to listen... 
 (BREAKS DOWN)' 
 What's wrong? 
 (MALE VOICE IN BACKGROUND ON PHONE) 
 'Dad, please, listen. 
 He wants you to get Julie out of the hospital.' 
 Julie? 
 'If you don't, he says he's gonna... 
 Dad, if you call the police, he says he's gonna hurt me and the baby. 
 (SOBS)' 
 Who? 
 You're not making any sense, love. 
 'Bring Jules to Canal Street. 
 He says he'll meet you there. 
 (SCUFFLING ON PHONE) 
 Please...' 
 Lucy! 
 Man : 'Give me the phone. 
 You phone the police, and she's dead.' 
 Who is this? 
 (LINE GOES DEAD) 
 Hello? 
 Hello?! 
 (LINE RINGS OUT) 
 Hello? 
 (LINE GOES DEAD) 
 (TYPING ON PHONE) 
 (LINE RINGS OUT) 
 Voicemail : 'Hey, it's Luce -' 
 sh1t! 
 Where is she? 
 Who? 
 Don't you play daft. 
 My daughter, where is she? 
 Oh, God, no... 
 You're hurting me! 
 He knew we were here now. 
 He knows that I'm with you - 
 OK, OK. 
 Listen, I got a message from my brother. 
 Dan told me to be here now, and I knew that if I collapsed then you'd have to bring me here. 
 But that is it. 
 That's it, I swear. 
 Jesus Christ! 
 Then what? 
 He must've told you. 
 What did he tell you? 
 No, I don't know. 
 I don't. 
 I thought maybe he wanted to see me. 
 See you? 
 No, he doesn't want to see you. 
 He wants me to get you out. 
 Where is she? 
 I swear on my life, I don't know. 
 Come here. 
 Stay there. 
 Who are you phoning? 
 Who do you think? 
 The police. 
 Wait. 
 Let me call him. 
 He'll listen to me. 
 (TYPING) 
 (It's his voicemail...) 
 Right. 
 What did Dan say, exactly? 
 (Please, Mr Murdoch. What did he say?) 
 He... h-he said to get you out, and to meet him on Canal Street. 
 Well, let's do that, then. 
 What? 
 Let's meet him. 
 And I'll talk to him and he'll tell me where Lucy is, and then we can phone the police and we can explain everything. 
 Please, I don't want him to hurt her. 
 
 
 
 (PHONE RINGS OUT) 
 She's my little girl. 
 I promise you, he will listen to me. 
 (PHONE CONTINUES RINGING) 
 Operator : 'Emergency, which service do you require?' 
 (ENDS CALL) 
 (BUTTON BEEPS) 
 (BUTTON BEEPS) 
 Come on! 
 Stairs. 
 (MALE VOICES AND RADIO CRACKLE) 
 Dave? 
 Dave! 
 (I'm sorry.) 
 (MUFFLED) 
 What the hell are you doing? 
 (HIGH-PITCHED ALARM) 
 (ALARM BELL) 
 Copy that. 
 (MUFFLED RADIO CHATTER) 
 Sorry. 
 It's OK. 
 I got your text. 
 I had a feeling you might be late. 
 (SIGHS) Sorry. 
 It's crime, it doesn't sleep. 
 I'll make it up to you. 
 Is there anything I can get you? 
 No, I'm fine, tha- Actually, yes. 
 I'll have a drink. 
 Can I have a dry white wine, please? 
 Large one, and I'll take another. 
 Well, at least you made it. 
 Busy day? 
 Manic. 
 What have you had? 
 (CLEARS THROAT) 
 Thanks, I'm starving. 
 Not got long. 
 Sue, while you are here er... 
 there's something I wanna run by you. 
 What's that? 
 Changing your name back to Walsh. 
 Really? 
 That's what you wanna talk about? 
 Why would I wanna change my name? 
 OK erm... 
 Tony's wife is Mrs Reinhardt. 
 You're Susan Walsh. 
 I can't be bothered going through all the rigmarole. 
 It's easy, you just use the Government Gateway. 
 Why would I wanna change my name? 
 I don't wanna marry another man's wife, Sue. 
 I wanna marry you. 
 What you on about, marry me? 
 Marry you. 
 I've been offered the job. 
 The police college? 
 But my practice is here - 
 I know. 
 What about us? 
 I haven't accepted it yet. 
 But you've thought about it? 
 That tells me everything I need to know. 
 Listen... 
 Let's not talk about it here. 
 Are you seriously thinking of... 
 upping sticks and running off to Hendon? 
 I'm not running off. 
 So it's got nothing to do with Ash getting promoted and not you? 
 No! 
 Oh, come on. 
 Your career is here. 
 Your life is here. 
 You're being stupid. 
 Sarge? 
 Oh, bloody hell. 
 Do you want me to come back? 
 What do you want?! 
 A prisoner's absconded. 
 So? 
 It's Julie Hope. 
 Daniel Hope's sister. 
 Lot of big words here. 
 Just give me the headlines. 
 Er...there's been a couple of incidents down at Ravenhill. 
 Syn...syn-cop-e? 
 What's that say? 
 She fainted. 
 Oh. 
 Right. 
 She's been down a couple of times for blood tests and screenings, but it's all a bit of a mystery, to be honest. 
 Right. 
 Do we know who brought her in? 
 Yeah, I spoke to the prison. 
 Principle escort's a female officer. 
 She's accounted for. 
 Not accounted for is a David Murdoch. 
 48, married, grown-up daughter. 
 We're checking his phone. 
 I think it's pay-as-you-go. 
 Already got on to the service providers. 
 Get you, acting like a proper copper. 
 You're giving me goosebumps. 
 Anyone would think you had a review coming up! 
 (DOOR OPENS AND CLOSES) 
 Sarge. 
 Susan Reinhardt? 
 I'm DS Reinhardt. 
 Jeff Crabtree. 
 Supervisor at Ravenhill. 
 I'm Murdoch's boss. 
 He's had a tough year. 
 His wife died. 
 We had him down as married. 
 No, she had cancer, Vicky. 
 Not even 50. 
 He had to put her into private care. 
 So, when did she die? 
 Would've been... 
 just over six months ago. 
 How long was she in care? 
 Over a year. 
 Well, that would've cost him. 
 I did what I could, you know. 
 Overtime, extra shifts. 
 His daughter chipped in. 
 Lucy. 
 Right. 
 Still... 
 would've been a good few grand. 
 Hold on. 
 What are you saying? 
 I'm not saying anything. 
 I'll tell you right now, I've known Dave for seven years. 
 He's the straightest bloke I ever met. 
 Straight as a die. 
 They always are, Jeff. 
 Until they're not. 
 Right, well, Murdoch's had an expensive year. 
 Medical bills. 
 Can you get Gibbons onto it? 
 Check his bank accounts. 
 Has he borrowed any money? 
 Has he got any debts? 
 What have you got? 
 A nurse heard Murdoch and Jules talking about Dan. 
 What, the brother? 
 Can't be him, he's dead. 
 Are they sure? 
 Positive. 
 Said Murdoch seemed a bit wound up. 
 What, they think someone was trying to help break her out? 
 What's the story? 
 Looks like an inside job. 
 So who's  behind  it? 
 Hang on. 
 What do we actually know? 
 That Murdoch and Jules are together. 
 Right. 
 You'd better find them, then, hadn't you? 
 (POUNDING BASS FROM CLUBS) 
 (PHONE RINGS) 
 Here. 
 We're on Canal Street. 
 Where are you? 
 'Well, that's good, cos now I know you're gonna do as you're told.' 
 We've done exactly what you asked. 
 Where's Lucy? 
 'I'm in a flat in Old Trafford. 
 710 Cherry Tree Gardens.' 
 You listen to me. 
 We had a deal. 
 Right? 
 Now, you put her on. 
 Put my daughter on. 
 Put her on! 
 Let me talk to him. 
 I know who you are. 
 'Yeah?' 
 You're Daniel Hope. 
 'Well, you'll see when you get here, won't you?' 
 (LINE GOES DEAD) 
 Don't... 
 Hello? 
 Well, what did he say? 
 He said they're on er... 
 They're in a flat in Old Trafford. 
 We're to meet them there. 
 Right, come on. 
 Let's go. 
 No. 
 No, I've had enough. 
 I'm going to the police. 
 No, no, no. 
 That's the last thing we want. 
 The cops turning up, Daniel getting scared. 
 We'll go there together - 
 I've had enough. 
 I'm going to the police. 
 Fine. 
 At least put that on. 
 (GLASS SMASHES) 
 Mate, are you OK? 
 (HORN BLARES) 
 Come here! 
 Oi! 
 What's going on?! 
 (TYRES SCREECH) 
 sh1t! 
 Jesus. 
 You all right, mate? 
 You OK? 
 (HUBBUB) 
 Hey! 
 Where you going? 
 (GATES CRASH) 
 Do you know what we've just done? 
 I know. 
 That copper could be dead. 
 Yeah, he could. 
 And do you think they'll buy it was an accident after what you've done? 
 It was an accident. 
 Of course they will. 
 Eventually. 
 All right, fine. 
 We'll do it your way. 
 Let's hand ourselves in. 
 What do you think will happen to Lucy by the time you get your story straight? 
 What do you think my brother will do if we don't show up? 
 How do we know it's your brother? 
 Come with me and you'll get your daughter back. 
 What choice have you got? 
 (DISTANT SIRENS) 
 (METALLIC RATTLING) 
 Try anything... 
 I will break... 
 your b*st*rd wrist. 
 You heard what happened on Chorlton Street? 
 Yeah. 
 How is he? 
 The lad's in surgery. 
 It's not good. 
 Most of section's turned up offering free overtime. 
 They're yours if you want them. 
 Thanks, sir. 
 (SIREN) 
 Old Trafford, please. 
 Barwell Estates. 
 Rightio. 
 (DOOR SLAMS) 
 (SIRENS CONTINUE IN DISTANCE) 
 (ALL HUM THE WEDDING MARCH) 
 Yes, all right. 
 Calm down, very funny. 
 Right. 
 You've all had your packs. 
 You know what's going on. 
 They went from the hospital to Canal Street, so where are they going next? 
 What's Murdoch's plan? 
 Could he turn to someone for help? 
 He's gonna need money. 
 Who is he doing this for and why? 
 It's no coincidence that Jules Hope absconded today, the same day as her brother was murdered. 
 There's one of ours in surgery right now, so let's get these two off the streets as soon as possible. 
 Actions have been allocated. 
 Get to it. 
 Come on, go. 
 (TALKING AMONGST SELVES) 
 Will, what have we got on Dan Hope? 
 Nothing. 
 No arrests, no convictions. 
 (SIGHS) Still no murder weapon? 
 No clue to who killed him? 
 Nothing. 
 We find Jules and I'm betting we find her brother's killer. 
 What about Murdoch's bank records? 
 Nothing suspicious. 
 Do the same with Jules. 
 Go through bank accounts, credit cards, known associates. 
 She went down for fraud. 
 Go through the case files. 
 Sarge. 
 And you, come on. 
 (Wish me luck.) 
 Where we going? 
 Chorlton Street. 
 Might as well help with these witness statements. 
 You all right? 
 You had to open your big gob about me and Phil. 
 What's the problem? 
 They're all made up. 
 Gibbons is buying a hat. 
 Oh, come on. 
 Bit long in the tooth for raving, aren't you, pal? 
 You've no idea, pal. 
 We're about ten minutes from the accident on Chorlton Street. 
 Radio : 'Copy that.' 
 (PHONE VIBRATES) 
 sh1t! 
 What? 
 Tommy Hatton. 
 The copper that got hit. 
 He's out of surgery, down as critical. 
 Oh, no. 
 (HORNS HONKING) 
 What's going on? 
 There must be some sort of accident. 
 There's a couple of bizzies parked up. 
 Yeah, there's definitely something going on. 
 They're pulling cars over. 
 Sorry about this. 
 Hey, what's your game? 
 Open the door. 
 Just open the door! 
 (HONKS HORN CONTINUOUSLY) 
 Open the f*cking door! 
 Open it! 
 (HORN CONTINUES) 
 Open the... 
 Open the door! 
 (DROWNED OUT BY HORN) 
 What you doing?! 
 Oi! 
 No! 
 Get here! 
 Gibbons over radio : 'Sarge?' 
 Go on, Will. 
 'Uniform's just reported an incident. 
 They've got eyes on Murdoch and Hope. 
 They're heading for the gasworks on foot.'  Right. 
 (SIREN) 
 (MULTIPLE SIRENS) 
 (INDISTINCT RADIO CHATTER) 
 Which way? 
 The ship canal. 
 Right. 
 One male, one female, last seen heading through the woods to the ship canal. 
 Start tracking. 
 Yes, sarge! 
 (DOGS BARKING) 
 Go on! 
 (DOGS BARK FRANTICALLY) 
 (DOGS BARKING IN DISTANCE) 
 (BARKING INTENSIFIES) 
 Run! 
 Check the buildings. 
 All of them. 
 Anything? 
 No. 
 (SIGHS) 
 They're in the water. 
 (BOTH BREATHING HARD) 
 (SIRENS CONTINUE IN DISTANCE) 
 (GROANS) 
 Come on. 
 (SIRENS) 
 We know they're in Old Trafford. 
 The taxi driver said he was taking them to the Barwell Estate, but all that's down there is flats. 
 Lots of flats. 
 Student digs. 
 We could start going door-to-door. 
 What? 
 Jules. 
 She was inside for credit card fraud. 
 Scamming stuff off Amazon and eBay. 
 Let's see where she got it delivered. 
 (TYPING ON PHONE) 
 (HELICOPTER HOVERS) 
 Now the helicopter shows up! 
 (HELICOPTER IN DISTANCE) 
 (CLATTERING) 
 Get in. 
 (SHUDDERS) 
 Can't you..? 
 No. 
 Key's gone.

 I'll tell them. 
 I'll tell them that this is nothing to do with you. 
 All I want is for Dan to let Lucy go. 
 Don't pretend you're on my side.

 She's all I've got. 
 He's all I've got.

 Wake up. 
 Gotta get going. 
 I need a wee. 
 Tough. 
 You'll have to hold it in. 
 Will. 
 Have you got anything? 
 Yes. 
 I've found an old drop address from Hope's fraud case. 
 Great. 
 Go on.

 Reinhardt on radio : 
 'Iddon, stand down! 
 Do you hear me?' 
 Urgent. 
 DS Reinhardt. 
 Ambulance and backup. 
 Now.

 We've got a body. 
 Where?
