 Grace : We're husband and wife. 
 You can share your secrets now. 
 Mark : I'm not who you think I am. 
 Mark's gone dark. 
 If he's off task, just bring him home. 
 Scott :  The Island of Dr. Moreau. 
 Yeah, it was a gift from Professor Duncan. 
 This could be his key. 
 We would like to buy your business. 
 What makes you think you have the stones for this line of work? 
 Duncan had tissue samples of the Castor Original. 
 Art : You're thinking that if you find him first, you can trade Helena for him? 
 It's just junk! 
 There's no test tubes, no slides! 
 You're not gonna believe this. 
 The boy clones are our brothers. 
 What did you tell her? 
 I'm your sister, Mark. 
 I made a mistake. 
 [Gunshot] 
 Bonnie : Mark... He took advantage of you. 
 Please. 
 [Gunshot] 
 Oh, my God, you're alive! 
 Get away from me! 
 Quiet, quiet. 
 I'm going to help you. 
 She's coming back. 
 Shh, shh. Quiet, quiet. 
 [Groaning] 
 Oh, my God. 
 Okay, put your hand over it. 
 I need to tie it off. 
 Do you have a belt? 
 Why are you helping me? 
 Quiet. 
 Sarah : Oh, Jesus Christ. 
 Man : What's going on? 
 He's in the corn. Go get him. 
 I got it. 
 Sarah : sh1t. 
 We have to go. Come on. 
 Come on, we have to go. 
 This is your fault. 
 I know you don't trust me. I'm all you've got. 
 ♪ nearer, my God ♪ 
♪ to thee ♪ 
♪ nearer to thee ♪ 
♪ e'en though it be a cross ♪ 
♪ that raiseth me ♪ 
 [Whispering] 
 Gracie has arrived. 
 Welcome home. 
 Bonnie : Gracie, this is Mr. Appleyard. 
 He was kind enough to take me and the others in after the fire. 
 Oh, little Gracie! 
 Oh, my. 
 You've grown into a pretty thing, haven't you? 
 Jonah was there when you were born. 
 He helped bring you into this world. 
 You had more to say then. 
 Now I understand  you're  the one with a blessed child. 
 All : Amen. 
 Well, let's... let's get you to the kitchen. 
 A mother-to-be needs to eat. 
 [Moaning and screaming] 
 Hey, keep it down! 
 Step aside. She's bleeding, Sergeant Miller. 
 Helena : My sh1t! 
 Eat my sh1t! 
 Okay, go in. 
 Yes, sir. 
 Coady : Sergeant Miller, report. 
 She bashed her head against the bars this time. 
 We'll have to get her over to the infirmary. 
 Helena, it breaks my heart to see you hurt yourself like this. 
 You know how this goes. 
 Keep still if you don't want it to hurt. 
 I just don't think Sarah should be engaging with these people. 
 Cosima: Well, "a,"  they have Helena, and "b," if their original genetic material really does exist, that's the closest thing we'll ever get to our own genome. 
 I mean, they're sick, too, but the good thing is that I'm actually improving. 
 Kira's stem cell treatment is actually working, so it's good. 
 Um, enough about that, though. 
 How's the election thingy going? 
 Um, school board trustee? Good. 
 Yeah, I have... I have... I have a lot of support. 
 Donnie : Ali? 
 Are you down here? I have to go. 
 Okay, ciao, be good. 
 Who were you talking to? 
 Alison : Cosima. What's going on? 
 I don't know. 
 Hey. Hey, hey, hey. 
 Why are you sweatier than usual? 
 I was out making deliveries... sorry, I mean rallying support for your campaign. 
 But there was a car following me. 
 Was it Marci Coates? 
 Honey, if she catches wind of this, I'm dead in the water. 
 Alison, I'm thinking police, not election. 
 I'm... I'm... 
 I'm sure it was nothing. 
 I'm sure it was nothing. 
 No, honey... 
 I'm sure it was nothing, but just in case, we should maybe take all of the incriminating evidence out of the house anyway, okay? 
 Okay, yeah, that's a good idea. 
 Good. 
 Okay. A storage locker, like on "Breaking Bad." 
 Sure, sure. Look, we'll label everything, we'll put it into tubs, and we'll be able to make it in time for swimming lessons. 
 Oh, my God, is everyone else's life this chaotic? 
 Where are all the pills? 
 [Grunting] 
 We need to get you to a hospital. 
 No. No hospital. 
 You take me, my people will find me. 
 Well, we need to get somewhere safe. 
 Sarah : No one's home. Doesn't look like they've been here for a while. 
 Oh, Jesus christ. 
 It's not as bad as it looks. 
 The bullet went through and through. 
 Hit muscle tissue, nothing vital. 
 But this... 
 The bullet is still in there. 
 We're gonna need to get it out. 
 We can find what we need inside. 
 Hey, hey, you're not gonna do that yourself. 
 That's gonna kill you. 
 Not if you help me. 
 Well, then you're gonna have to give me some answers. 
 Come on. 
 Up you get. 
 Sergeant Miller, this is Silva. Over. 
 Miller here. All done with our guest here. Copy. Be there in ten. Take your time. She'll be out another hour. Copy. Miller out. Scorpion : Helena. Helena. Get up. They're gone. Hurry up. We don't have much time before the drugs set in. My arm is like dead fish. You have to stay alert. Look for an escape. To escape the first box, you must know what next box holds. Right. Scout this place and get back here. Don't blunder around like an idiot. I will be as quiet as church mouse. Scorpion : Hurry up. You're gonna pass out. Helena : No, no, no. Not yet. [Muffled voices] [Moaning] [Moaning] [Moaning] Scorpion : Helena. On your feet. Snap out of it. Get us back before it's too late. [Sighs] [Mark grunts] Okay, go ahead. I'm not... I'm not putting my finger in your leg. I need you to go in there and feel the bullet. No, no, no. Can you give me that? You're gonna tell me where Helena's being kept. I've been on mission for over a year. I don't know. Bullshit. Where is she? HQ is mobile. If my people have her, she could be anywhere. Can I have that, please? Aaah! Okay, stick it in fast. It'll hurt less. [Laughs] God, you must be one hell of a first date. [Whimpers] Do you feel it? Is it moving? What? Can you wiggle it? Can you wiggle it? Yes, yes, I can wiggle it. Okay, good. That means it's not embedded in the bone, okay. Oh, God. [Coughing] Okay, grab the pliers. I need you to go back in and grab it. If I'm gonna do this, you're gonna tell me about your mission. Rudy, your brother, he paid me a visit. He threatened my daughter. Look, we know you get sick. We do, too. All right. We had intel that Johanssen stole samples back before the project was shut down, but I didn't find anything. Will you please do it? Okay. Okay. [Gasps] [Moaning] Aaaah! [Groans] Okay... okay, I've got it, I've got it. Aaah! Okay, okay. Good, good, good. [Moaning] [Whimpering] Thank you. Donnie : Ow, ow, ow! Ah! Oh, is it your sciatica, Donnie? Well, honey, you gave me the soap, which is like a hundred times heavier than the pills, so, yeah, it's my sciatica. Okay, fine. You take the pills. Careful, careful, careful. What? Open the door. How are you... You lift with your legs, Donnie. Donnie : Thank you, honey. You're the best. Excuse me. This is private property, buddy. You can't just come in here and have your lunch, you... did he just shush me? Wait, you're the one who was following me today. See? I knew it. Do you work for Marci Coates? Hmm? Yeah, I don't know who that is. Then who are you? A messenger. Pretty sure you got some merchandise that belongs to my boss. Alison : If you're referring to the relaxation materials, we paid Ramon for those in full, over $30,000. Yeah, well, thing is, that wasn't Ramon's to sell. He was working on consignment, suddenly dropped off the radar. Well, that's because he's at college. That first week can be really overwhelming. I remember frosh week was... Donnie, he didn't go to college. Man : Whatever the case, my boss wants a meeting. So... I think you should get a sitter tonight for Oscar and for Gemma. All right? I'll keep these till then. Okay, sport? Yeah. Yeah. That's great, sure. I'll be in touch. Cosima : Highlighted passages, nonsense formula. Duncan's book is just a big jumble. Scott: I know, and I'm hoping there's a vigenere Cypher buried under all that noise. But we'd still need a key to read it. And without that... There's no way to figure out which passage  goes with which synthetic sequence. If it's even about the sequences at all. It could be about something else, I got to go, Scott. Felix : Hello, darling. Hello, darling. Are you... oh, my God. It's hideous. What? Looks like you've been mounted by a llama. Oh, this? No, I just... I had a chill. Oh, you had a chill. Did you? Really? Yes. Expensive perfume... [Sniffs] Pretentious French cigarettes, and, oh, yes, eskimo pie. Don't go there, Felix. Cosima, this jumper absolutely reeks of pining. I... pine for no woman. I regret maybe ever having met her, but I am not pining. I'm anti-pine. Okay, then great, you can come down with me to Bobby's bar for a nip or two. Nah, I have to wait for Sarah's call. You can wait for Sarah's call from Bobby's bar. Let's go, and get out of that yeti-like sweater. [Knocking] Bonnie : Gracie? The others have arrived. I want you to come greet them. I... I'll be right out. Gracie, open this door. I'll be right out. What's going on? I was just getting changed. Aah! A-ha! Alexis! Alexis! Aaah! [Inhales] Sorry. I'm not really the homemaker type. The military, they... They start you young? Since before I can remember. And no parents? No monitors or whatever, people who raised you? No, we were... we were raised together. We weren't allowed outside attachments. Hmm. But then you met gracie. So why didn't you just run off with her? Hunting people is what we were trained for. My brothers would have tracked us. I thought if I could just find the samples, that... You could trade those for your freedom. Doesn't matter. [Sighs] Whatever Johanssen stole is gone. It was just junk. What was? Mark, did you find something? Mark? Mark? [Ringing] 911. What's your emergency? Um, um, uh, someone's been shot. I need an ambulance right away. Yeah. Don't you worry about that. What's the name of the motel again? Okay. Copy. I'm on my way now. I'll let you know what I find. 
 
 [Door opening] Donnie : These guys are late. What are you looking for? Don't worry, baby. Oh, my God. Donnie! Hey, hey, hey, easy! I've got a gun in my hands! You brought a gun to a drug deal? What are you, crazy? Of course I did. Put it back. No! Do you remember what happened the last time you had a gun in a car? You know what? I know what I'm doing. I'm protecting this family, all right? They're here. Okay, play cool. Play cool. 'Sup, bro? Arms up. Arms up. Attagirl. Spread your legs. Easy, that's my wife. Shut up. Okay. Oh! Okay. Good. Good? Okay. I'm good. I... I have touching issues. He only wants to talk to her. What? No, no, no. No, no. You go, we stay. Got your back, honey. Your little valet felt me up. So it is you. Jason Kellerman? Alison Hendrix. What... I... I haven't seen you since... Since... Since you dumped my ass in high school. I don't think that's exactly what happened. Yeah, it is, but... Yeah, you know... I mean, this is weird. Jason Kellerman, this is so weird! Oh, my God! Alison. Yeah, I mean... Lionel tells me that this couple named Donnie and Alison Hendrix muscled in on Ramon. We didn't muscle exactly, we... it's okay. I mean, I heard all about it. Jesus. Look at you. You look great. Aww. You... Um, but yes, that's my husband. Donnie. I met him in college. Lucky man. I'm not even angry anymore. At her, at myself. I'm just... Hey. What do you think, you're about five-two? Yeah. Why? What are you doing? Nobody meets anyone in person anymore, darling. It's the future. No, no, no. I'm not doing Sapphire. Why not? Why not? I'm not... no. No. No. It's pretty. I'm not gonna let an app decide who I love. Oh, God, not love, darling, not love. I'm talking about a scratching post. Something to rub yourself up against. Do you know what, Cos, if you don't put yourself out there, then you're never really going to find what you're looking for, anyways. What am I really looking for? The one who stays in your heart forever, no matter what. [Allison laughing] Do you still... do you still drive that motorcycle? I do. I'd bring you for a ride, but I'm sure your mother would still have a word or two to say with me. You know, she always liked you. Really? Yeah. You know, speaking of bad influences, why are you doing this, Alison? With all due respect, I don't think that needs to be shared. Strictly business. Mm-hmm. I like that. You know, I know this community. If you give me those pills back, I'll have your money back within the week and I will double Ramon's weight. You know, I got to say, the soap thing is pretty genius. [Chuckles] [Mobile ringing] She's calling. Hey, Cosima, it's me. Hey, what's going on? Long story. It turns out Castor Mark was undercover for the military. With the proletheans? Yeah, and get this. Johanssen was Professor Duncan's lab assistant at Project Leda. What? So johanssen had original Castor material? I think I'm looking at the box he used to hold it in, but there's nothing here except old journals and sh1t. I've sent you something, Cosima. Okay. Okay, I got it. "Experiment notation." February 12, second attempt. Fourth attempt, no meiosis. February 18, "S.C.N.T. Successful." What's that mean? Somatic cell nuclear transfer. That's how you clone. So, wait, Johanssen used the samples, then, to try and make more clones? God complex much? If that's what he did and succeeded, then that child would have the exact same DNA as the Castor original. Well, then I'm not looking for tissue samples, I'm looking for Johanssen's son. Yeah, and he would have needed embryos, someone... someone to carry the child. Yeah, I think I met her. Oh, see, God, this is thy kingdom. Thou knowest what happens in thy kingdom. Enfolded in eternal life, may the lamb find peace in your kingdom. I'm sorry. The child is lost! Leave us. Go. Now! Mother... I don't know what happened. What happened, Gracie, is that you betrayed your family. God wanted to punish you, so he cursed you and he took the child. Our legacy, and you... Lost it. I'm so sorry. What can I do? There is nothing to do. The only reason our door was open to you again was because of that child, and now it's gone. You've ruined the last chance for this family. You will not be welcomed back here again. Don't move. I told you not to call anybody. I knew I couldn't trust you. No, no, no. Listen, listen, listen. There's a chance. I found something. Mark, Mark. The reason we can't find the Castor samples is because Johanssen used them, to make a clone. What? What are you talking about? He and his wife. They used the original tissue to make a son. We find him, we get a bit of DNA, that's all we need. Did he ever mention a son? He did, didn't he? Do you know where he is? This is where Henrik and Bonnie lived just after they were married. And their son lives here now? You're gonna have to pull around back. [Grunts] The kid's dead? Johanssen said that he and Bonnie had had a child before Gracie, but it didn't survive. If they can get... [grunts] DNA from 25-year-old blood slides... What's ever left out here should be more than enough. You're not gonna dig up a dead baby. No. Not me. Can you point that thing somewhere else? I'm not going anywhere, you know. You're trying awfully hard to save someone you tried to kill once. How do you know about that? We took care of Helena, spent time with her. She said it was you that shot her. The more reason I'm doing this. [Door unlocking] You know, it's not her fault, the way she is. She's not a monster, she was just... Trained to be a killer. Does that sound familiar? How do you know she's even still alive? I just do. I can feel it. Your people took her for a reason, yeah? We'd do anything to find a cure. You must be Parsons. [Moaning] Please... K... what did they do to you? Kill... Me. K... kill... Me. Scorpion : Stupid girl. Why would you waste your chance of escape on him? He's already dead. Get moving. Leave him. Please... Please... We've both been abandoned by our families, left to suffer. I will make it go away. No more pain, little one. Shh. Shh, shh, shh. [Humming] [Monitor beeping rapidly] Sleep now, lamb chop. Sleep. [Flatline] [Alarm blaring] Coady : Guards! You stupid girl. You say you love boys, but you lie. Guards! You're a sh1t mother! Take her. Hey. Hey! Mark. Mark! Stay awake. I don't need you dying on me, brother. You know I'm not really your brother. Well, you are. Biology says you are. If we find the biology in here, then we both got what we need. [Heavy breathing] [Thud] Mark, I've got it. Don't think he can hear you. Oh, sh1t. Here. You take this. You give... you give me back Helena. You're not in a position to make demands, now, are you, Sarah? What's in the box? It's what you want. It's Castor DNA. Open it. Let's go! Yes, yes. Oh, for Christ’s sake. [Moaning] Sarah? I know you're in here. Sarah. You really shouldn't have done that. I would have made it quick and painless. Well... Relatively. How is that sweet little girl of yours, anyway? Hmm? Kira sure is gonna miss her mommy. [High-pitched] Mommy? Mommy? Where are you? Mommy! I can't find you! Oh. There you are, mommy. Please, you've got what you wanted. Please let me go. Afraid I can't do that. Mark : Soldier! Stand down. Now why would I listen to you? Because I'm your superior officer, and I gave you an order. No, sorry. I don't take orders from traitors. Watch your mouth, soldier. Mind who you're talking to. You were working with the enemy. I followed you. I was doing what I had to do to complete my mission, which I did. That's more than you can say, but then again, no one ever expected much from you, did they? You're wounded. Weak. I could just end you both right now, take what you found and bring it back to mother. She'd never know the difference. Then do it... Little brother. Well? What are you waiting for? Well done, brother. Good to see you, sir. All right, you jackass, go grab that box. We got to bring it home. You know we don't leave loose ends. No. No, we don't. By comparing his genome to yours, we can isolate the defect, develop a gene therapy. Are you Arthur Bell? She doesn't look ready for cult deprogramming to me. I'm not a Prolethean anymore. And we're just supposed to take your word for it? Ha ha! Is this your first sapphire date? Yeah, yeah, it is. You're way more than I expected. Anybody? All you had to do was stay away. I'm not someone you can fight, Sarah.
