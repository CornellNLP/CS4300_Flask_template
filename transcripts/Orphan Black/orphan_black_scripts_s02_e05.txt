 Sarah. We make a family. 
 Helena does have a soul, she does have a purpose, and she is part of our family now. 
 Go back to hell, where you belong. 
 sh1t! 
 Henrik! 
 I'm sick, Delphine. 
 Are you my dad? 
 Where's my niece? You left her with Cal? 
 Your mom has a lot going on right now. 
 "This organism is restricted intellectual property". 
 They patented us. 
 "Project LEDA"... I mean, it's total military-speak. 
 You know the mythology of Leda and the swan? 
 "Six scientists incinerated in lab explosion". 
 Felix: These were Rachel's parents. 
 Cosima: Susan and Ethan Duncan,  they were geneticists. 
 I love you, too. You're not really the smartest clone, are you? Smart enough to know you're shagging Rachel. I shot you! You were dead! You were dead! He took something from inside of me. And a new life begins. Rachel, you don't need to see this. I demanded to. Now, move. I'd like to see him, please. Leekie: I'm sorry, Rachel. Daniel was a very loyal man. To you. To us both. This wasn't Sarah. No. I believe we all recognize the handiwork. Your white whale, Aldous. Seems we have a pair of them. Security footage shows her leaving with Sarah. The twins are back together. Fascinating, actually, if one can rise above it, Rachel. Animals. How was Taiwan, Paul? You two get along? He performed admirably. I did my job. Huh. Personal security, was it? That's right. She could've killed you, you know? Thank you for your concern. There is a kinder, gentler way, Rachel. This is all the result of your heavy handed tactics. Trust me, Aldous, I've only just begun.  You do realize I'm going to have to paint this, to come to terms with it. Please don't. Yeah, you're right. I mean, you shot your evil twin sister dead, only to have her arise and gut Rachel's henchman. How could I capture the nuance? Yeah, believe me, you couldn't. You are now pitted between two psychopaths. Cut her loose. If she hadn't shown up, I'd be dead. She can't stay here, Sarah. She's not... Oi! Just... Just... Just get her something to wear. Please? Fine. I'm sure I've got a Ukrainian folk costume in here, somewhere. [Hiss] Oh, God! Hey! Hey hey hey. You treat him with respect. You got it? That's my brother. Which means he's one of our sisters, family. You get it, meathead? Do not call me this. Do you understand, Helena? He is sestra? Oh, God. Exactly. So pick some clothes, wash up, and do everything he tells you to. [Sniff] Thank you, Felix. Just don't kill my rubber ducky. Jesus. What did those fish-cult freaks do to her? I don't know. She wouldn't say. But I know somebody who can handle her. Maybe he can find out. I just need you to chaperone her. Oh, come on. If you would, while I get my sh1t together please. You are truly unbelievable. Take this. Go talk to your daughter. Thank you. These socks are wet. What? Agreed. Those are wet socks. Hey, you want to wear my socks? They're pretty cool, they're gray, and they'll be like knee-highs on you. [Laughing] No. You know what? Good call. You're going to need more than big socks this morning. I know this has been sort of confusing, Kira. I don't blame you for being put out. But, since we're stuck in this together, there's no reason why we shouldn't have a little fun. And there's no reason why we shouldn't have really awesome socks. Right? Sit, please, Paul. I'm in need of a new monitor. You have a monitor? She did. Daniel. I've been self-aware since I was a child. I'm not exempt from the program. I simply enjoy a unique vantage, one with privilege. She needs full-time personal security. And you submit data to me on her health and well being, like any other subject. Are you asking me if I'm interested or reminding me I have no choice? It's a promotion, Paul. A very handsome one, if you have the starch for it. Where are you with the new stem-cell line, Aldous? My in vitro tests have been very promising. Promising enough to treat Cosima. Shut down the tests. Until Sarah comes to heel, Cosima will suffer. Back in the early '80s, genetics was like the wild west. No one knew the science. The laws didn't exist, so they slapped provisional patents on everything. Like pissing on a fencepost. Yeah, like  leave it in legal limbo until the laws change or you can figure out if it's worth anything. They would still have to register them, though, right? Back then, anything as advanced as synthetic DNA would probably have fallen under the military, somehow. The DYAD was just a contractor. It could be a secret military patent. Hmm, that makes sense. Wait. How would I find that out? I guess you wait  until a guy in aviators shows up and tells you  you're in violation. Scott, you're supposed to be my expert on genetic patents, here. I just blog about it. Why can't I come work for you on the super-sensitive sh1t? Delphine, why can't Scott come and work with us on the super-sensitive sh1t? Because we'd have to kill his family. You hear that? That's fine. I applied with a letter from the Dean. Hi, Scott. Bye, Scott. He's so cute. Did you get these? What? They're tissue test results from a stem-cell line, one that I've never seen before, and they are... What? Compatible, with you. Really? But they were sent to me by mistake. They were meant for Leekie. He's supposed to share all the science with us. Why don't we have these cultures? I don't know. Because they're experimental or proprietary. That doesn't matter. I'll try anything. So will I. Where are you? I'm in a place where bands play. What bands? I don't know. Bobby, who's playing tonight? The sh1t Goblins. Sorry. Yeah. Yeah. I miss you, monkey. I'm not a monkey anymore. You're not? I'm a leopard. Cool! Yeah, wow. I like the jacket, too. You can talk to daddy now. Hey, monk... Monkey. Kira. [Sigh] "Daddy". Sorry about that. I keep telling her it's "Cal", but she daddyed me twice this morning. She can call you what she wants. It's fine. You sure you're okay? Mind if we don't get into it? A little. Right, well, this, then... That guy you crashed into. Yeah, the DYAD gentleman. Yeah, well, he didn't... He didn't die. Not by your hand. Ah, I'm relieved, you know. Ostensibly. [Chuckle] Where are you guys? Close enough to grab you when you're ready. I look forward to that. All right, best behavior,  little sestra. Hello, again, Detective Bell. Inside. Hands on the table. I don't like to be touched. Yeah? Well, that's too bad. I just gave her new clothes. She didn't have any weapons, or anything like... That's my pen. I wanted to write letter. I haven't forgot that you took a shot at me. [Chuckle] Give me your hands. Do as he says, meathead. The windows are a 30-foot drop to concrete. All sharp objects have been locked away. The only way in and out of here is through me. So, in other words, you're safe here. Look, Helena, he wants to help you and Sarah. He lies down with pigs. [Snorting] And that's my cue to leave. I've got a hot date, too. Good luck with... That. Oh, um, try food. Gracie won't talk, and so she remains, until she admits the truth. Sure she's lying? We both know. If she won't open her heart to Helena, then she's clinging to the old ways. A punishment to fit the crime, Henrik. It's been 12 hours. Well... Gracie, you ready to tell us what really happened with Helena? She can rot. Ethan: Well, I'm going to have to come after you and tickle you! Here I come, the tickle monster! Oh, no! Thanks, mummy. I love you. What about poor daddy? I love you, too, daddy. Aw. Now, go get... Oh! Sarah's trying to learn everything about me, just as I am with her. I want this to be clear, Paul... As my monitor, you report my data to Aldous, but you work for me. Do you understand? Not exactly. I've known Leekie my entire life. When my adoptive parents died, he became something of a guardian to me. But, now, my position in the corporation essentially outranks his DYAD directorship. He can become too attached to his subjects, myself included. Sometimes he can't make the hard choices. Did you read the report on Cal Morrison? Made his money in micro optics. May have anti corporate leanings. What is it you're looking for? I want to know if he's the other side of Kira's biological equation. The timeline works. We can place him with Sarah 8 years ago. [Sigh] Does that bother you? That Sarah's back with the father of her child. No. Up until now, your entanglements with Sarah have been your saving grace, Paul. I never asked her to cross my path. You didn't ask for me, either. Now, it's time to make a decision, Paul. This is Daniel... This was Daniel's gun. It can be tied to the murder of a police officer. There's no middle ground anymore. What do you need me to do? Art: Hey. [Snapping fingers] Hey! Maggie Chen. Also a prolethean. She was your spotter. She tracked down clones for you. The two of you worked together. [Humming] But, the thing is, last time I saw you, you were running away from Johanssen's followers in a wedding dress. You want to tell me what that was all about? What did they do to you? What did they do to you? How did Maggie find the clones? How did she communicate with you? I am a very patient man, Helena. So, I'ma just make me a grilled cheese sandwich while you think about it. Sorry I can't help you out of this. Your dad's sending me after Helena. She's got to carry the child, right? Gracie. I don't know if she's a miracle or not, but, if something happened, just confess. Confession heals all. It doesn't matter to me, what you did. When I was 7, the nuns said I had devils inside me. Sister Olga locked me in cellar. She gave me darkness. So, I gave her darkness. [Pop] Does Sarah know of Swan Man? I don't think so. Swan Man played God. How'd he do that? He's in her locker. Whose locker? Maggie's? Why does Rachel want Sarah? Is it for Kira, too? Does Maggie chen have a locker? How does this help my sestra? Listen, Helena, this is really important. I want to tell you something. Yeah. These, I like.

 [Radio chatter] You're not going to find anything, other than a few roaches, all right? And aren't you supposed to show me some identification? Hello, Felix. Oh, you bloody pricks. Why can't you just leave my sister alone, hmm?! Playing with team Rachel now, yeah? Got the corrupt arm of the law in her clutch purse. [Wheezing laugh] So what's this, you come to finish me off, big-dick Paul? You were at Cal Morrison's cabin. I don't know what you're talking about. What are you going to do with that? Okay, put that down. Put it down. Paul? [Gasping] Paul! Paul, what are you doing?! Are you crazy?! What are you doing?! [Sobbing] I'm sorry! I'm sorry! I'm sorry! What are you doing?! [Gasp] [Ringtone] [Ring] Felix? What the hell is going on? Hello, Sarah. Where's my brother? Right here. I'm fine. Present company excepted. I have a murder weapon with Felix's prints on it. What?! And a detective waiting in the hallway to find it. Then, they'll find the gun was used to kill Officer Tom Bowman at your friend Cal's place. You... You bloody  gutless b*st*rd! Felix will be charged with murder, unless Rachel gets what she wants. So your little trip to Taiwan really paid off. How many clone notches in your belt now, eh, Paul, 3? She wants everything, Sarah... You, Helena. Kira. No more games. This was never a game, you stupid twat. The ball is in your court, Sarah. You have until morning. Whoa, whoa whoa whoa whoa, Sarah, Sarah, slow down. Art, you've got to help me with this. Rachel's ruthless. Okay, I will call some people at the station and see if this is real or if Rachel's just bluffing. They've got a gun on him. Do you hear me?! Okay, but it's not that easy to set someone up. Art, you've seen what they're capable of. Don't do anything crazy, okay? Do you hear me? Just come to my place. Yes, well, what else am I going to do? I've got nowhere else to go, do I? [Cocks gun] Easy, easy. Going to hurt her. Bonnie: Well, Gracie? There you go. I was protecting us. Not taking a real life, like killing a coyote that wants to eat our chickens. I'm so sorry, father. Just, uh, you help us get her back and all will be forgiven. And, if you don't... Then you will carry the child yourself. Cosima: Are you sure this is a good idea? If he's withholding promising treatment from you, yes. He's going to ruin your career, destroy your reputation as a budding lesbian. No, I think he's probably culturing it himself, so I would check these fridges. For a beaker marked "culture"? [Chuckle] Oh, sh1t. sh1t! Oh, merde. Dr. Cormier. My bad. I wanted to see the original genome. No! She didn't. Aldous, you held back a stem-cell line from us. In fact, I didn't. Remember I told you I was developing a pluripotent stem-cell line from baby teeth? Yeah. But Rachel is obstructing further testing. Why the hell would she do that? In a word? Sarah. You seen this before? Who are they? Two forefathers of the original experiment. This was in Sarah's possession. I'm going to tell you something that only a handful of people know. 20 years ago, there was a fire in one of our labs. Several scientists died, reams of data lost, and the original genome was destroyed. So all of this secrecy around the original genome is because it doesn't exist? Yes. The entire project is essentially an orphan. We lost your prehistory, Cosima, and, with it, all record of several synthetic sequences embedded in your DNA. What kind of synthetic sequences? The sequences that make you possible. That overcame the viability issues that have haunted us ever since. So you lost the map. So finding the sequence in the genome is like looking for hay in a haystack. So, you see, if Sarah has uncovered something, I need to know. I have no idea. Whether I believe that or not, as a gesture of good faith, I'm willing to disregard Rachel and proceed with the treatment. Cal: Dinner's almost ready. I hope you like burnt spaghetti. What are you drawing? A picture. I didn't think your mom had any sisters. They're new. They all look the same, but I can tell them apart. What do you mean by that? Someone's coming. You're right. [Banging on door] Who's there?! Police officer. [Radio chatter] Ahem, evening. Evening. Don't see many RV's this late in the year. Just thought I'd see how you were making out. Yeah, we're good. Thanks. I'm just camping with my daughter. Hmm. Mind if I see your ID and vehicle registration? Sure, no problem. It's here. Where are you from? Uh, Seattle. There you go. You're a long way from home. Andrew Cooper. Yep. You heading back out west? Yep, back home. Hmm. You don't mind if I take a look inside the RV? Trick-or-treat! [Laughing] Whoa! Halloween's over, kiddo. I know, but you're burning dinner again. Oh, right, but it gives the food a nice, smoky flavor. No, it doesn't. She, um, she went as some video game character. Ah, better let you guys have your supper. Goodnight. Goodnight. You're quick on your feet, aren't ya? [Laughs] Oh, sh1t! She escaped? Yeah. Can you pass me the goddamn keys? On the fish tank. Yeah. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. Not this again. Yeah, more riddles from your sister. Well, how does it work? Last time, they were GPS coordinates. Three places we'd been, one we hadn't. Let's go. [Metal creaking] This matches the coordinates. What do you think? I don't know. She said something about a locker. Helena! Don't jump out and scare us with an axe or some sh1t. She likes bikes, right? Yeah. I think she rode off on one. Why the hell did she send us here? What does she want? Eh. I think this is Maggie Chen's locker. She must've used it as a drop for information for Helena. She camped out here. What a sad life. Art: "Swan Man". What? Swan Man. Helena said that might mean something to you. Swan, "Leda and the swan". Project LEDA. She said he was playing God. Could that be the same man? This photo's like 1977? So he'd be, what, in his 70s now? Yeah. Yeah, it could be. sh1t! That could mean that our creators... One of them, Rachel's dad, he could still be alive. He didn't die in the lab explosion. I need to call Cosima. This is something I can use, something I can trade for Felix. Sarah. What? Sniper rifle. She's going to kill Rachel. [Piano concerto plays] Paul. '63 Margaux, 2 glasses. [Humming] A little more off the back, Helena. Yes, Rachel, of course. So pretty, you are. So much money. So much money. Put it down. Take off your shirt. She's got about a 20-minute lead on us. We're close to Rachel's. I tell you, she's fast. [Smooching] Don't. Move. Take off your pants. Daniel like that? Did Sarah? Hey, what's that? What? Hey, stop, stop. [Tires screech] Hey hey hey, hold up. That's her bike. And that's Rachel's building, there. Wait, what side is Rachel's suite on? It faces this way. That's a clear line of sight for a sniper. Come on. [Alarm chirps] Get that chair. Take those off. Sit down. Do you like my hair, Paul? [Laconically] Yeah, very pretty, dirty, sexy Rachel. Like my mother. Hello, sestra. Helena, stop! Helena! Put the gun down. Mind your weapon, Art, or I pull trigger. [Exhaling forcefully] Come see, Sarah. Okay. You can't do this. You can't. Rachel is problem. I fix problem. I wish you could. They've got Felix. Brother sestra. He's in jail. If you kill Rachel, they're going to keep him there. Look. Look, Sarah. [Panting] Paul is unfaithful. [Tearfully] I don't care about Paul. [Smooching] He doesn't matter anymore. Then I kill him for you. No! Helena! Stop! Take your finger off the trigger and put down the gun. No, just... Pull, Art, see who's faster. Please. I can't let her shoot. Helena. Listen to me. There's another way. We can make a deal for Felix, but I need your help. Only you can help me find Swan Man. You only want to use me. [Crying] No, that's not true. You saved my life. You're my sister. Helena, I thought... I thought I killed you. I couldn't tell anybody what I lost. You came back. Please, put down the gun. Please. [Sniffle] That's good. Come down. Thank you. You make me cry, sestra. [Chuckle] Come on, meathead. [Sniffle] Don't call me this. [Chuckle] Here we go. Just an intradermal test to see how your body responds. Yes, if my arm falls off, then we know. [Laughter] Or if you grow another limb. Yeah. Ew. Um... Oh, Dr. Leekie, in light of what you shared with us earlier, we have a proposition for you. We do? No. No, not us. Us. I'm all ears. We want to know... You like to drink beer? Hmm? [Rock music plays] Dr. Leekie. Sarah. So I hear I'm not the only data you lost. You have something for me? Professor Ethan Duncan, alive. Where? It's vital my brother goes free. All charges dropped. Find him, I can pull the levers to countermand Rachel, and guarantee Cosima will be able to continue the treatment. What treatment? Ah, so you don't share everything. What? What, is she sick? Unfortunately, yes. With what? With what Katja had? I'll let her explain. But all the more reason to find Duncan. I can buy you 3 days. If anybody follows us, I'm going to sic Helena on all of you. Not an idle threat. No, it's not. Well, that looked interesting. [Chuckle] Rachel had you follow me. She thought you might make a deal with Sarah behind her back. Well, Sarah's off on a trip down memory lane. Then so am I. What she finds there may be dangerous to us all, Paul. So I need you to come to me, first, before Rachel. I'll be in touch. Right, so how do we find Swan Man? This is nice truck. Much leg rooms. Helena, where are we going? Cold River. What's that, a town? The place of screams. You act like you've never been in a car before. I've never been on road trip. We're clones. I can't help but think that the godhead has put you here to test me. I'm wondering how a simple guy like me keeps a girl like you in a place like this. Aah! You knew all along. You're just one of them, aren't ya? Hello, Paul.
