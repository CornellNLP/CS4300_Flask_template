 Twenty years ago, there was a fire in one of our labs, and the original genome was destroyed. 
 These were Rachel's parents. 
 Susan and Ethan Duncan. 
 They were geneticists. 
 I love you too, Daddy. Why are you so scared  for us to find out about Project LEDA? I shot you! You were dead! You ready to tell us what really happened with Helena? I'm sick, Delphine. I'm willing to disregard Rachel and proceed with the treatment. This was Daniel's gun. What do you need me to do? Felix will be charged with murder unless Rachel gets what she wants. You have until morning. More riddles from your sister. This matches the coordinates. This is Maggie Chen's locker. She must have used it as a drop for information for Helena. "Swan Man." Professor Ethan Duncan, alive. It's vital my brother goes free. I can buy you three days. Only you can help me find Swan Man. Where are we going? Cold River. What's that? A town? A place of screams. (insects chirping) You've got an iron gut, haven't you? I only ate half. No, thank you. You have to eat, Sarah. So, your Cold River, it's not on the map. Where is it? That would spoil the surprise. Why don't you just tell me where Duncan is? We can take him to Leekie. If you knew where Swan Man was, you would leave me behind. Sestra? Yeah? If you have Kira, and we are twins, could I have babies too? Why? I'm very good with children. You said the Proletheans did something to you. Something about... Married? What happened? I don't know. I've had a fever. Kira is lucky. Why is that? You are a good mother. Mm, I don't really think so. (whispering): There's somebody here. What? (animal breathing) Ruff! Ruff! Look, look. He likes you. (Sarah laughs.) He likes you. (kissing sound) (licking sound) Ew! (Helena laughs.) Gross. Go to sleep, weirdo. We've got an early start. Don't let the bedbugs bite. (loud fart) (Helena laughing) Excuse me. Piss off! (Helena chuckling)  God, you act like you've never been in a car before. I've never been on road trip, only told where to go and what to do. (switching through stations) Can you just... pick a station, please? ♪ ("Sugar Sugar" by The Archies)♪ 
♪ Sugar...♪ Nuh-uh. Not happening. ♪ Honey, honey♪ Oh, for f... (Helena singing along) ♪ You are my candy girl♪ 
♪ And you've got me wanting you ♪ Well, this must have been a huge hit with the nuns in Ukraine. Yes. Super Sunshine Kids. (Helena singing along) ♪ You are my candy girl♪ 
♪ And you got me wanting you ♪ Are you gonna sing the whole way? ♪ I just can't believe the loving and... ♪ 
♪ Uh, I just can't believe it's you ♪ 
♪ Oh, honey! ♪ (Sarah laughing) Stop, please. ♪ Oh, sug... Honey ♪ (laughing) ♪ You are my candy girl♪ 
♪ And you've got me wanting you! ♪ Oh, my god! Helena, stop, please! ♪ Oh, honey! ♪ There's no sign of inflammation. Are you OK? No pain? It's fine. It's promising. Hey, contain yourself, please. Sarah is scared now of getting sick too, her and Kira, as if she needed anything else to worry about. You have to tell them eventually. Yeah, but I wanted to have some answers, you know? Give them something, not just more crappy news. You can offer hope. If these results stay positive, we move to implantation. Stem cells from the exfoliated dental pulp of baby teeth in my uterus. That's not invasive at all. Come on. How do you even know this is a match? The odds of compatibility are like a million to one. Luckily, we only had to search thousands of samples before we found it. There are benefits to being a multinational. Oh, pauvre petit chou. You're the puppy. (phone ringing) (French accent): Dr. Cormier. Who? Hey, Scott. Cosima, hey. Hi. What are you doing here? I can't believe it either. Dr. Leekie personally approved my application. Did you know about this? Well, we need a sequencing tech, and you said he was the best. OK, one sec. Delphine, we can't involve him in this. That's crazy. Well, he is involved. You gave him your samples. Yeah, but he doesn't know that. Look, he found your synthetic sequence, and we need an expert we can trust on examining that. Hey, sorry, we're not hiring right now. But... No. Cosima... I know about the clones. I thought stealing from my kids was rock bottom,  till I, uh, blew my dealer in a bus station bathroom. It's pretty much get clean or die trying after that. Twenty-one days, Gus. You're stronger than you think. (applause) Alison. Me? No, thank you. I'm gonna sit this one out. No, you won't. You're up. I'm just here for my kids. And I'm sorry that I ruined the play with my drinking. (Alison giggling) Alison, it's not about sorry. It's about taking responsibility. Well, I'm not an actual drunk, am I? (knocking on door) Sorry, I'm so sorry. Back from the world. How was the specialist, Victor? Whew! Doc offers me oxy. I was like, "No, thanks." So he offers me a local, and I'm like, "Mm-mmm." Then he gets to poking and snipping at the stump. Pain like a tidal wave. But... Thank you, Lord. I just didn't cave. Just don't confuse suffering with healing, Victor. Victor. Yeah, no, I don't want that, for sure. All right, let's talk Family Day. ♪(aggressive rock music playing)♪ (knocking on door) (music turned off) Oy! Whoa! Whoa! Jesus Christ! Get out. Piss off. Sarah told me to check on you. That's so thoughtful. Oh, my lord, that really takes the sting out of being framed for murder. OK, I think you've had enough. Come on. Yeah, I've had enough. My love life's a shambles, and I've been demoted from babysitter to bargaining chip, so you're right, Arthur. I've had enough. OK, all right, all right, come on. Bedtime. (Felix laughing) Arthur, you beast. I'm not even taking any new clients. Yeah? Yeah. Then how about you take your hand off my ass. (Felix giggles) (laughing) OK, everyone, that's it. See you next week. Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa. We need to talk. I'm not Sarah. And I'm not stupid. You... Take care, man. You're the one that maced me in the parking lot. Right? What are you, twins? We're clones, Victor. What do you think of that? Fine. You don't want to tell me, it's all outside those walls anyway. In all honesty, that face is the last thing that I ever wanted to see again. Good. Then leave me alone. But... I can't help but think that the Godhead has put you here to test me. The Godhead? Yeah. Oh, my god. Please just let me eat my humble pie in peace. Thank you. This isn't Cold River, Helena. The church. Is this where Duncan is? Where he was last seen. Ah. Maggie tracked him here. Now we follow his trail, yes? Oh, no, no, no. No, you are staying in the car. Don't cause any trouble. Can I have radio? No, Helena, just... Don't do anything. Please. Can I help you with anything? Uh... What is this place? I've seen it before. That's the Cold River Institute. Cold River. Yes. It was shut down in the '70s. What's your interest in it? Have you ever seen this man? Mr. Peckham. He's been here a few times to look at the archives. I'd like to see the archives. Uh, no. I think they're best left alone. Oh, I'm a student of his. It's for my thesis. A 36 base pair variation in identical samples? Didn't make sense. But then you guys started asking about genetic patents, so I was like, "Encoded marker tags. Duh." Anyway... Uh, identical genomes with markers and embedded patents had to be clones. So... Can I see one? You want to see a clone? Yeah. Let's... Take it one step at a time. ♪ (country music playing) ♪ 
♪ I had no trouble finding a friend ♪ 
♪ When I was abroad ♪ 
♪ I'd wander for miles and miles ♪ 
♪ And every face gave me a smile ♪ Starting early, huh? Better pace yourself. I'm on vacation. Do you want to join us? We're nicer than we look. I think you bad goat. (bleating): Maaaa. Are you being rude, you little skank? I'm not quite sure I heard what you said. (finger breaking) Jeez! You broke my finger! Don't be baby. I only sprain. Next one I break. You know what?! Hey, hey, let her be, Carl. Carl. Move it, Jesse. She just... Made herself clear. Crazy bitch! Sorry about that, ma'am. Miller and pork rind. (bartender): Sure thing. There you go. White Russian? Pork rind? When the institution was torn down, we moved the records here for their historical value. Sometimes I wish we'd burned the lot. Your professor was poking around in this section. 1910, 1920. Early years. But the institute was active a lot longer than most people think. Could you? What you see here won't leave you. Yeah, I get that feeling. You said you'd bring the kids. I will. On Family Day. I wanted to see them today. Well, Alison, until you start taking this place seriously, I don't think it's a good environment for them. As if I'm the one who should be in here proving myself. And what does that mean? It means, Donnie, that once this is all over, you'll have nowhere to hide. OK, you know what? Now you're threatening me... I'm not actually making threats. And if you show up here without my kids again, I will cut off your dangly balls! Hey, you guys all good? Sorry? Anger is a tool, and we use it on problems, not people. She's working on this a lot harder than you'd think. Don't. Well, I hope he's right, honey. We'll see you on Family Day. Fine. (deep metallic creaking) (deep metallic creaking) Oh... God. Bollocks. Why are you still here? Is that coffee? Jesus, you're the best date I've had in ages. Holy sh1t. He's moved in. Helena's storage locker was a goldmine. I need your help. Are you serious? God, this sh1t's like pure nightmare fuel. Oy. I don't understand any of this. Well, welcome to the party. Come on! We've got to put it all together. I know all about you. Felix told me all about Vic the Dick. Yeah, I'm sure he did. I know you were abusive to Sarah. And that you attacked me in a parking lot. Yeah, I was in a lot of pain. But I'm walking the path of the Buddha now... Oh, would you quit it with the Buddha business? You're here for your kids, right? Yes, why else would I be here? (He chuckles.) Sure. OK. I'm a... a... a... bottle hider. Why do I have to admit that to a bunch of drug losers? You don't have to admit it, but you will realize that sober smack heads are the best listeners, so... I feel like I'm in the prison yard. (He laughs.) Aw. Terrible. (billiards break) In Ukraine, I was police detective. I shot many criminals. Ukraine, huh? Phew... I've never been further than Sioux Falls myself. Then I was brilliant scientist. But I quit to be with my family. Oh, come on. Don't tell me you're spoken for. The worst after rehab drinking problems. But now I am... With my sestra,  having adventures. You sure have led a life, huh? I wonder how a simple guy like me keeps a girl like you in a place like this. You'd have to be very strong. No... Oh! Aw! God! (Helena laughing) Here. You're good. I didn't even notice you on their tail till last night. Special forces? JTF2? Boy Scouts. Yep. But I never met a real Prolethean before. I expect DYAD sent you after the other one. Are you waiting till she drinks herself senseless, or for the bar to clear out? Just letting her enjoy herself a bit. She's a miracle, I'm told. Well, whatever she is, she's not worth dying for. Is yours? Cosima: You know, good intentions, bad science. Sound familiar? Not really. Should it? Yeah. 
 
 Project LEDA. I mean, Cold River is, like, the perfect ideological breeding ground  for a nature-nurture cloning fiasco. Well, they did a shite job breeding us, didn't they? Well, science is what scientists do, Sarah. You know, nobody's got any idea. We're just, poking at things with sticks. Are you gonna be all right, Cosima? Yeah, of course. Honestly. Honestly. We just... We just started testing with, um, a new stem cell match, actually. I don't know what that means. It's promising. I can't do this without you. Yeah, obviously. I'm the geek monkey. (laughing) Yes, you are. Hey, when I get back, we're gonna get Alison out of rehab. I know. Yeah, definitely. We're stronger together. Go figure. Hold on. Cambridge Biology Delegation. Hmm? Duncan was at Cold River. ♪ (country rock music playing)♪ (grunting with effort) You know what? You... Have real pretty eyes. You... Have a nice hat. Very nice red face. Oh! No! (Helena laughing) Damn! Oh, all right. All right, tie breaker. OK. Let's do this. Real challenge, please. (new song playing) Wait, wait, wait, wait. ♪ Crazy ♪ 
♪ That's what they call me ♪ May I? ♪ Walk along the razor's edge ♪ 
♪ Into black and back again ♪ 
♪ Crazy ♪ 
♪ That's what they tell me ♪

(Carl) Ah! Good luck with that kid. (Carl yelling in pain) ♪ Crazy♪ There were some patient histories missing, some files missing. Pilfering. Another reason why I try to keep them locked up. You think it was my professor? Mr. Peckham? I don't think so, no. A woman came in after him, maybe another student friend of yours. Uh... Margaret? Asian? 40's? Yes. Maggie Chen. In the eye. Roy. Hey, come on. Roy! Come on. Roy! Roy, pl... Come on, man. She didn't do nothing! I want my boyfriend. Roy! Roy! Sestra. I want my boyfriend. Where is Jesse? No idea. But those guys you beat up aren't pressing charges. Good. So I continue my holiday. Yeah, as soon as the paperwork's done. Your, uh, sister is here. Sister. It's good to see you. You tried to kill me. Yes. (chuckling) My father and I, we don't... we don't always see eye to eye, so... He sewed you silent. Your lips. I had this also once. It will heal. Helena... We want you to come back. I have my sestra now. She needs me. She's not coming back for you. Helena... We want to take you to your children. You took my babies from inside me. Your eggs. My father, he... He made them whole for you. Why? Because, he sees something beautiful in you. But you don't. It doesn't matter what I see. He will take my babies... And put them inside me like how I was made. How? Yes. Like that. (officer): She's free to go. Hello, Helena. Your friend asked me to give you this. Take me to my babies. (Sarah): Hey, can you make sure she's all right? Art: Well, I can make some phone calls and see if I can get Helena released. Thanks. Uh, look, there were files missing, OK? Patient histories. Maggie Chen hid them in her locker. You should have something about a Peckham. Really? Hang on. Um... What? Here. It's a patient medical record for an Andrew Peckham. He died in 1943, he was two years old, his father was deceased, and his mother died in childbirth. An orphan. Well, look, the date's right. Duncan would be over 70. You thinking what I'm thinking, Fee? That Duncan stole Peckham's identity? The archivist told me It's good to have you here, Scott. Do you need anything? Yeah, one thing. I signed my confidentiality agreement, OK? You guys can trust me. OK. Cosima had me looking at stem cell growth kinetics, but I wanted to see if DYAD tagged them like they tagged the clones, so I ran a PCR. And... They're not clone cells; they're from a totally different person. So I checked for familial markers. The clones share 13 STR loci with the stem cell donor. Whoever you cloned, do they have a female relative? Like a niece or even a daughter? Scott, you cannot tell Cosima about this. Uh... Not... Not one word. Do you understand me? Victor? Hey. You want to come for a smoke? No. No, no, no, no. It's not one of my vices. Well, I'm kicking mine one at a time. Good. Oh, I have to make these place settings for Family Day. Just... OK. I could use some help, if you... OK, sure. Two good hands between us, right? Yeah. See you up there? Yes. Thank you. Namaste. Don't do that. OK. How's recovery going, Vic? We're gonna make doilies together. I'm impressed. Yeah? That makes one of us. Hey, it's too late for second thoughts. We have a deal. (Vic sighs.) I'll get you your dirt on Alison Hendrix, but my charges go away and I'm done. Mm-hmm. No, I mean it. I'm done. Got it. This sh1t's cramping my recovery, Detective. Hm. Art: Hey, I found an Andrew Peckham in Brockville. It's about two and a half hours away. Thanks, Art. I should have known you'd show up. With sh1t on your shoe, no doubt. You bitch. You knew all along. My whole life you knew. You're just one of them, aren't you? I am not one of them. Just like you, I got caught up in a struggle I didn't ask for. Only I've been at it longer, so I'm better at it than you. I didn't come here for your sh1t, Siobhan. Where's Duncan? Is he here? His name is Peckham. It has been ever since he came over to our side 20 years ago. We hid him in exchange for information about... experiments on unborn children and a surrogate who ran away. Amelia. Yes. Carlton found you in the foster system and... DYAD have been after us ever since. I don't believe a word you say. The question is: who do you trust? (kettle whistling) After you. Rosaline. Come on, Rosaline. Good girl. Come on. Andrew. I've got someone who wants to meet you. Hmm? Here. You're, uh... Sarah Manning. Not Rachel? She's the one I told you about. Remember? Amelia's child. Ah, sorry. Forgive me. Yeah, that's not what I'm here for. Can I, um, get you both some tea? Oh, you've... You've done it. We need to get moving, unfortunately. The birds can't feed themselves. Rosaline... Don't worry. I'll take care of it. I always do. Five minutes. I'm not sure where to start. I don't know how many there are. We weren't the only implantation team. Project LEDA. What are we for? Proof of concept... How everything starts. The military recruited Susan and I in... 1974, '75? Seventy-six. Huh. Susan was the brains, really. Did you know that she cracked the spindle protein problem? What did you do? We succeeded. Cloned human embryos. What a feat. But an oversight committee declared us an ethical failure. Um, are you sure you won't have some tea? How was DYAD involved? Contractor. When the military... Scuppered our work, DYAD persuaded us to, um, push on to full term. So DYAD hijacked Project LEDA. Once you've gone too far, it's hard not to go all the way. Why? What did you want? Babies. Little girls. You know we're not just a concept, right? That we're your consequences? Have you met Rachel? My Rachel? Yes, I have. What a treat. You've really created a monster there. We didn't. We loved her. No, please. I want to see her. What makes you think I'd do that for you? Hello, Paul. Sarah's in there with Duncan? Oh, yes. Tea? It's just tea, Paul. Just a conversation. And what would I talk about with you? Well, your next move, of course. I've got biscuits in my pocket. No, thanks. Who sent you? DYAD. Hardly an answer. DYAD's a hydra. God's sake. If Sarah's caught between Leekie and Rachel, I bet you are too. And a man with two masters answers only to himself. Who does Siobhan Sadler answer to? I'm a mum, aren't I? If you think you're taking Sarah back, you'll have to kill me. And if you think you're gonna take Duncan back, the only man alive who can give Sarah and her sisters what they need, then you'll have to kill us both. But you don't want to do that. Or Afghanistan would all have been for naught. What would you know about that? Paul, in your position, you could really use a new friend. Was it  ever real, your little family? Or was it just an experiment? It was both. So it was Daddy, Rachel's first monitor. Of course, but... Do you know what DYAD's done to her? What she's become? That wasn't us. It wasn't even DYAD. It was the Neolutionists inside DYAD. Dr. Leekie. I don't have to talk to you. Yes, you do, and you know it! It's all in the past. No, it's not! This is my life! And you gave it to me, so you're gonna help us! No. Yes, you are. I will take you to Leekie. You can talk to him then. They stole my daughter. Your daughter is lost. There's just me. And Alison, a housewife with two adopted kids. And Cosima, a brilliant scientist, just like you. I can't. We're real, Ethan. Cosima is... Unlike anybody I've ever met. And she's sick. We're sick. Your... Little girls are dying. It could happen to Rachel too. T... Try to stop it. You can help us now. You don't understand. (Sarah): What don't I understand? Leekie. Leekie wouldn't let us raise her. We were going to expose everything, but he found out. Go on. You can tell her. Who do you think I've been hiding from all these years? Aldous Leekie killed my Susan. He killed Rachel's mother.
