 We're clones. 
 We're someone's experiment and they're killing us off! 
 I'm not Beth. 
 Beth was on this killer's hit list and, now, I am. 
 Someone is covering up their illegal experiments by wiping us out. 
 If Sarah misses tonight, then she may never get Kira back. 
 She want me to impersonate her in front of her daughter? 
 You're not my mother. 
 I'm sorry about this, but it's very important that you keep this a secret. 
 If that was my boyfriend, I'd just in front of a train too. 
 Something's different. 
 Everything all right here? 
 Does she seem all right to you? 
 Look, we need to spend some time together, figure out what's suddenly going on with us, because most of it I like a lot. 
 Sarah blindsided me, then she took off with the coke. 
 I'm on the hook with Pouchy! 
 Maggie helped make you. 
 Beth killed her to protect us. 
 We have a connection. Can you feel it? 
 Go. Run! 
 I quit. 
 Shh. Shh, shh, shh. 
 Tomas. 
 Easy now. 
 Sleep, child. 
 Sleep. 
 (Siren in the distance) 
 So, the killer's still out there. 
 Yeah, probably crawled back to the freak that sent her after us. 
 Did you have to quit being a cop? 
 How can that help? 
 Alison, this isn't  why I called. I want to thank you  for helping with Kira. 
 Oh. 
 Yeah, I get to see her tomorrow, and, uh, you set that up, so... 
 Well, she's a special little girl. 
 I can tell. You're very lucky. 
 No. 
 Hey! 
 Beth! Stop, it's me! 
 Oh, my God. You asshole! 
 You'd stab me in the eye with a nail file? 
 Yeah, you sneak up on me in the shower, I am gonna stab you in the eye with a nail file! 
 Aren't you supposed to be at Cody's? 
 I didn't mean to scare you. I'm sorry. 
 How sorry are you? 
 Beth. 
 Get in. 
 ♪ Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah ♪ 
♪ yeah, yeah, yeah ♪ 
♪ yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah ♪ 
 Beth. 
 Mm. 
 Let's go away. 
 You're off the force. 
 I hate my job. 
 Let's pack our bags. 
 Right now. 
 I'm serious. 
 Let's talk about it in the morning. 
 (Indistinct talking) 
 (Beeping) 
 It's on the scanner. She's coming out. 
 (Gasp) Let's get her down. 
 Now! Just put it in now! 
 (Gagging) 
 (Cough) 
 (Gasp)

 (Knocking on door) 
 Hey, you want coffee? 
 Uh, no thanks. 
 How you feeling? 
 What? 
 No gun, no badge, nowhere to be. 
 Mm-hmm. 
 Let's leave. 
 We don't have any ties. 
 I have three simple words for you: Paul. 
 Rio de Janeiro. 
 I can't just leave now and think about going to Rio. 
 Why not? 
 It's what you wanted, right? Commitment. I'm ready. 
 No, I can't think about this right now. 
 What's wrong? 
 Nothing's wrong. 
 You're shaking like a leaf. 
 Where are you going? 
 I'm just going out for some air. 
 Ok? 
 It's an electrode from an electroencephalogram array a what? 
 An EEG helmet. It monitors electrical activity in the brain. 
 So it wasn't a bloody dream, then, was it? 
 I knew it. Well, how long have I been saying this? We're like lab rats in an illegal experiment. 
 Sarah, where was Paul during all this? 
 Uh... there were doctors, um, two or three of them. He could be in on it, though. Maybe he set it up. 
 Well, somebody must be watching the lab rats... someone we know. 
 Well, I mean, if it were my experiment, yeah, I would 
 Put an observer close to the subject... 
 You know, somebody to keep tabs and accumulate data. 
 Cosima... What'd they do to me? 
 I think you'd know if they'd done anything really... um, invasive. 
 Oh, my God. 
 I'm just saying, um, 
 An EEG is like a neurological test, and that mark on your arm looks like... a blood sample. 
 It sounds diagnostic. 
 With Paul in on it? 
 I don't know. 
 Why? 
 Just 'cause he slept with you? 
 Fee. 
 Yeah, we sort of ended up shagging. 
 Dude, that's complex. 
 You slept with Beth's boyfriend? 
 Oh. 
 Far be it from me. 
 I may be sleeping with my spy as well. 
 There's the gun you wanted. I've gotta go. 
 Hey, hey, where's the money? 
 (Sigh) What's it for? 
 It's the self-defense fund, yeah? 
 Last time I checked, I'm the only one defending us. 
 Here's 20,000. 
 Please use it wisely. 
 Yeah, I'll bring you the receipt. 
 I am gonna shoot Paul's balls off. 
 Wait, just, um, just squeeze them, ok? 
 He's our way into this whole thing. 
 But if my blind subject were suddenly to become... 
 Self-aware, it'd either be a Eureka moment or... 
 Yeah? 
 I would terminate, so... 
 Be careful, ok? 
 On that note... 
 (Cell phone ringing) 
 sh1t. 
 Cop station. Third time today. 
 No, don't answer that. 
 Uh, Art, what do you want? 
 It's Raj. 
 Mmm... 
 I'm off the force, Raj. 
 I know. You ok? 
 Yeah. 
 Ok, well, you know That surveillance sh1t that I lent you? 
 I'm gonna need that back before they inventory. 
 Surveillance sh1t? Right. Right. 
 And, Beth, level with me. 
 This is just about Paul, right? 
 Look, I'll get back to you in a couple days, ok? 
 So, Beth had surveillance equipment. 
 So then she was on to Paul too. 
 The question is: did she find anything? 
 It's critical. 
 One week she's fine, the next it's armageddon. 
 No, I understand that, but I don't want to give her any reason to react. 
 Well, you tell me! 
 If it gets any worse, what are our options? 
 What are you doing? 
 I have to call you back. 
 Why... why were you in my vanity? 
 I need... scissors. 
 Who were you talking to? 
 Just now? 
 Mm-hmm. 
 Uh, Big Rich, from work. 
 About me? 
 About Susan Teller. She's all over us this quarter. 
 You know that. 
 Oh, good. Um, can you cut this tag off? 
 It's driving me crazy. 
 Much better. 
 All right, what do we do if he walks in? 
 Shoot him. 
 I'm kidding. 
 Just... find the surveillance stuff, yeah? 
 And put everything back where you found it. 
 This place is antiseptic. 
 Paul's whole world feels fake now. 
 What? 
 I don't leave prints when I burgle. 
 Trexcom Consulting. 
 If, uh, fake Paul was observing Beth, what makes you so certain no one's observing Sarah Manning? 
 Who? Mrs. S hates me. I haven't seen her in a year. 
 And I'm giving you the benefit of the doubt. 
 A ringing vote of confidence. 
 Nothing on Beth's computer. Nothing. 
 No audio files, no video, no transcripts. 
 Holy sh1t. 
 Hey, hey. Hey. 
 He's military. 
 Looks like you're not the only one keeping secrets. 
 What are those? 
 Letters from Beth. 
 To Paul? I want to read them. 
 Uh, uh, uh. 
 No, they're private. 
 Where the hell is this surveillance stuff? 
 Don't know. We've searched everywhere. 
 There we go. 
 She wasn't messing around, was she? 
 Maybe it's time to find out where Paul works. 
 Oh, yeah. Trexcom Consulting. 
 Fake Paul, fake company. 
 I bet you money there's nothing there. 
 No way. 
 Beth. 
 We downsized, remember? 
 Paul's office is over here now. 
 Oh, right. 
 Yeah, of course. 
 He's in a meeting. 
 Oh. Y... you know what, um... we kinda got into it this morning. 
 I brought up some lunch as a peace offering. 
 Come on. 
 I'll just... 
 Sure. 
 Big Boob Blowies? 
 Felix, I hope  you can hear this. 
 Yes! Yeah, I can. 
 Now, you silly bitch, would you get your fanny out of there? 
 You brought me lunch. 
 Yeah. 
 Olive branch. 
 Beth, this morning... You want to talk about it? 
 I'd rather talk about last night  in the shower. Paul. 
 I came to bring you lunch, that's all. 
 Something's changed with us. 
 Mmm. 
 I know you can feel it. 
 What happened to your scar? 
 What? 
 The scar on your neck from the mountain bike crash. 
 It's gone. 
 Oh. Really? 
 I-I'm using a new lotion. 
 Let me see. 
 (She laughs.) 
 You will try anything, won't you? 
 I will. 
 But I gotta get back to work. 
 Thanks for lunch. 
 See you tonight. 
 Ok. 
 Madison. 
 Clear my afternoon, ok? 
 Something came up. 
 sh1t. 
 Alison, what are you doing? 
 Uh... 
 What's in the box, Donnie? 
 It's private. 
 No, it isn't! What... what is in it? 
 Donnie, what's in the box? 
 I am entitled to a little privacy, even in this house. 
 Oh, that's rich coming from you. 
 What hell is that supposed to mean? 
 Open the box, Donnie! 
 Give it to me! 
 Open it! 
 Alison... Alison, stop it! 
 Yeah, blood looks fine. No infection. 
 What kind of symptoms are we talking about? 
 Um... shortness of breath, coughing up blood... 
 That sort of thing. 
 Who's the subject? 
 Uh, subjects, and if I told you that, I'd have to kill you. 
 Ha! Ha... 
 Ha! Ha! Um, can you run a PCR on these samples, see if there are any genetic markers? 
 You're thinking... 
 Antitrypsin deficiency? Cystic fibrosis? 
 Yeah, that kind of thing. 
 And, um, can you sequence for Cytochrome C? 
 The barcode gene? 
 Mm-hmm. 
 That's the one we use for species differentiation. 
 Is it? 
 (Awkward chuckle) 
 What's in it for me? 
 Um, how about you get to have s*x... with yourself? 
 (Laughing) 
 Aw-awesome deal. 
 Arrête. Arrête, je te dis. 
 C'est difficile pour moi aussi. 
 Oui. 
 Non, non. Tu ne peux pas venir ici, parce... 
 Parce... parce que j'ai du boulot, parce que... allez. 
 Allez, il faut que j'y aille. 
 I'm sorry. 
 (Sigh) He's a b*st*rd. 
 Felix:  Who? 
 Paul. Beth loved him, but he wouldn't love her back and he wouldn't leave her. 
 Mm. Well, he's certainly changed his tune now, hasn't he? 
 Sarah, he's falling for you. 
 God, what a mess. 
 (School bell ringing) 
 I'm outside Kira's school. 
 (Sigh) 
 Of all the things that scare me right now, Fee,  this one's the heaviest. 
 You know she can't wait to see you, right? 
 Yeah, thanks. 
 She's the only thing that really matters, you know? 
 (Knocking on door) 
 I know. Um, give her my love, ok? 
 Colin. 
 Hi. 
 So glad you could step away. 
 From the morgue? 
 Uh, trust me, scheduling isn't really an issue. 
 (Kids laughing and shouting) 
 Hi. 
 It's me this time. 
 I know. 
 God, I missed you so much. 
 I missed you too. 
 (Laughing) 
 Why are you wearing such fancy clothes? 
 Ah... 
 You don't miss a thing, do you? 
 Are you ok, mommy? 
 Yeah. 
 I am now. 
 God, you're so big. 
 I'm the smallest kid in my class. 
 (Laughing) 
 Well, you're big to me. 
 How come you never told me about Auntie Alison? 
 I didn't know her. 
 She looks just like you. 
 Yeah. 
 One day, I'll explain it all to you. Yeah, monkey? 
 Is someone trying to hurt us? 
 Why do you ask that? 
 Alison said you're making sure we're safe. 
 (Camera clicking) 
 Hey. Hey. 
 No. 
 You're safe, Kira. I promise. 
 Ok? 
 Mrs. S:  You coming in? 
 (Girl crying) 
 Hey. Sorry. 
 You just forgot this in the lab. Sorry. 
 Thank you. 
 Yeah. 
 But... full disclosure: I, um, did peek. 
 You're French. 
 You have killers grades. 
 Thank you. 
 Um, um, oh, God. I am so sorry. 
 I'm not usually like... like this. 
 Oh. Bad breakup? 
 Yeah, well, we're an ocean apart, so... 
 Yeah. Long distance never works. 
 Um, you're in microbiology too, right? 
 Yes. Um, immunology. I study host-parasite relationships. 
 Oh, cool, cool. Yeah, I'm evo-devo. 
 Evolutionary development. 
 Yeah, yeah. That's... that's what we call it here. 
 Yeah. 
 Yeah. 
 Delphine. 
 Cosima. 
 Enchantée. 
 Enchantée. 
 You're so independent, aren't you? 
 Hmm, monkey? 
 Little monkey? 
 Remind you of anyone? 
 Yeah, but I was much angrier, wasn't I? 
 Even small. 
 You were the one who introduced me to punk rock, though. 
 Yeah. You took all of the attitude, none of the politics. 
 I'm just happy she doesn't have to bounce around like I did. 
 I was her age when I came to live with you in London, yeah? 
 A little bit older. 
 Well, you got me this far. 
 I know that. 
 I still need your help, though. 
 Ah. 
 I need you to tell me, uh... what you really know about me... 
 Where I came from. 
 Why now? 
 I'm trying to square things away. 
 For Kira, you know? 
 You were part of the foster system. I took in kids. 
 You know, I don't know who your parents were. 
 Yeah, I talked to... Family Services in Brixton already, but I just wondered if there's anything else. 
 
 
 
 Is everything ok? 
 Yeah. 
 Yeah, I'm fine. 
 What about Vic? 
 Vic still in the picture? 
 God no. 
 That much I can promise. Vic is done. 
 Ok! 
 How you doing, boss? Nice to see you, Pouchy. 
 Pouchy, she jumped in front of a train. 
 I don't even know why she did it, all right? 
 Sure, we had our ups and downs, but everything was fine. 
 She had the coke on her. 
 So I'm thinking maybe the cops have it. Give me one week. 
 Pouchy. I'll get you your money. 
 You say that last week! 
 I'm good for it, Pouchy. You know me. Pouchy, please. 
 Wait a minute, Pouchy. One more week. I'll get you your money, man! Ok! 
 Ok! Ok! 
 Pouchy, please! One more week, man! Ok, give me a minute! 
 Ok! All right! Ok! All right! 
 Ok! You want money? Ok! Ok! Give me a minute! I just need to... 
 (Screaming) 
 I'm good. 
 Ok. 
 One chocolate bar each. 
 That's it. 
 Ok. 
 Hold your sister's hand. 
 Ok? And don't talk to anybody. 
 Ok. 
 Ok, mom. 
 I love you. 
 Love you too. 
 Ok, mom. 
 Uh, deterrence, or surveillance? 
 Surveillance, please. 
 Something small. 
 You mean something like, uh, this? Wireless, discreet, they call it the nanny cam. 
 Sometimes the nanny's pinching your valuables; sometimes your husband's pinching the nanny, you know? 
 Just show me how it works, please. 
 (Kids laughing) 
 Stay in school. 
 I mean it, buddy. 
 Sarah? 
 (Vic laughing) 
 Sarah? 
 Sarah. 
 Sarah. 
 Hey, Sarah. 
 Sarah, you're alive! 
 Sarah, it's me! 
 Look at me. 
 Uh, I-I don't... 
 (Awkward laugh) 
 I don't know who you are. 
 You bitch, you faked it? 
 You've got the wrong person. 
 You faked it, you bitch! How could you do this to me?! 
 Sarah, I thought you were dead! 
 How could you goddamn do this to me? Ah! Ahh! 
 My eyes! Aw, you bitch! 
 (Taser zapping) 
 Aw! Ah! 
 Ahhh! Goddamn it! 
 (Alison): - Ah, there they are. 
 (Vic): - Goddamn! Die! 
 Ok. It's a race. Into the car. 
 It's a race to get into the car. 
 Sarah! 
 Ok, whoever gets in first wins! 
 (Gemma): - Who's that guy? 
 (Vic): - Ah! Sarah! 
 Ok. 
 You bitch! 
 (Cell phone ringing) 
 Hello. Alison. 
 I was just assaulted 
 By a disgusting thug who thought I was you. 
 Who? What'd he look like? 
 I don't know. He was... 
 Urban. 
 What the hell does that mean? 
 Not white, ok? 
 Oh, sh1t. Vic? 
 What happened? 
 I assaulted him back is what happened. 
 Please tell me that's not Kira's father. 
 No, no, absolutely not. 
 Well, what's going on with Paul? 
 Well, we think Beth was spying on him. 
 We found surveillance gear. 
 She never told me about that. 
 Is it true? Is he a mole? 
 I don't know that yet. 
 What's going on with you? 
 Nothing, I'm fine. 
 Call me when you know something for sure. 
 Olivier. 
 Paul. 
 What are you doing here? Is something wrong? 
 We need to talk about Beth. 
 How was she this morning? 
 Fine. 
 Everything's fine. 
 (Felix): You don't do this sort of thing much, do you? 
 You mean with a live person? 
 Oh! Ha! 
 Morgue humor. 
 You're awfully cute. 
 Ok. 
 Ok. 
 Ok, bye. 
 Bye. 
 The morgue attendant? Really? 
 Can you knock? 
 Brilliant, Fee. 
 Shagging the bloke that we conned into identifying my body. 
 Colin is the first nice boy I've met in ages. 
 What, like six weeks? 
 No. At least eight. 
 Where do you think this is gonna go, eh? 
 Oh, my God. 
 Oh, I'm so sorry. I completely forget rule number one: That your life is always more important than mine. 
 No, it's just way more difficult. Vic is back. 
 Oh, sh1t. 
 Yeah, he ran into Alison, so he thinks I'm alive. 
 I'll figure it out. I'll... I need to know what happened at Paul's office. 
 Sorry. I've been a bit busy, Haven't I? 
 Well, I did record something. 
 (Paul):  What are you doing here? Is something wrong? 
 This is it. 
 (Olivier): We need to talk about Beth. 
 How was she this morning? - Fine. Everything's fine. 
 Are you still concerned about her mental health? 
 No. She's better, certainly better. 
 You understand your role as monitor is not to interfere. Monitor. But if there's anything pertinent I should know... Anything at all... If there were, I would tell you. (Cell phone ringing) Oh, sh1t. It's him. No, don't answer that. No! Hello? Paul:  Beth. Where are you? Out. Where are you? We have to talk. About what? I need you to come home. Yeah, I don't think so. He knows something. Well, you can't go back there. You know that. No, I can't. (Cell phone notification) Oh, sh1t. Oh, my God. Paul followed me straight to Kira. (Door sliding open) Is this a bad time? You tase me, you mace me, but you think I'm just gonna... I'm just gonna walk away like I'm nobody? I was working a job. Oh. Yeah? Yeah, you would've ruined the whole thing. Yeah? Guess you're on a roll now, huh, Sarah? And that coke that you stole from me. Pretending to be dead. Who do you think took the fall for that? Huh? Pouchy took my finger. If I don't come up with 15k... (Clicking his tongue). he's gonna lobster me. A finger every week until all I have left is a lobster claw. Sit down. Sit down. Do you want the money, or not? Vic. That's 20k... 15 for your debt, and then five for your pain and suffering. That must have been some play. Mmmmm. This is "piss off" money, ok? You don't get to know anything. I'm entitled to know everything. Can I ask you a question? How do you do it? Lying there in that morgue. Holding your breath, Sarah, while I am bawling, I'm crying like a goddamn child. You know what's crazy? You know how stupid I am? I'm standing here looking at you, and I keep thinking about is Myrtle Beach. You remember? Yeah, that was a long time ago, Vic. I was working with that mook, Angel. You had your in with the carnies. I'm not proud of what we did. We were on top of the world, Sarah. We were parasites. No, we were in love. Not me. Ever. I think she means it, Victor. You want that money? Take it and go now. Right now, Vic! Ok. This is not over, Sarah. Is every man in your life a complete w*nk*r except me? I need you to go to S's house. Make sure Kira's ok, yeah? You're not going back to Paul's. I will not let him threaten my daughter. Sarah, you're not going back to Paul's! Sarah! No, it's fine. Don't worry. If anything else comes up, I'll let you know. (Siren in the distance) (Cell phone ringing) (Sigh) Felix called you? Yeah. He just played me the recording. I heard everything. Where are you? I'm about to go in  and shoot Paul in the balls. Wait, Sarah. This is our chance to get answers. He followed me to Kira, Cos. I know, I know, but he also covered for you. Right? That Olivier guy, he asked if anything was wrong, and Paul said no. Why? 'Cause I think he may be falling for fake Beth. Yes! That's awesome! That... You can use that. What do you think Got me into this mess in the first place, huh? Ok, I know. Just chill. I think that Oliver guy, he runs Paul. It sounds like some kind of double blind. What are you going on about? They are keeping Paul in the dark too. Right? So that he can't skew the results either. (Gun loaded) You mean he may not even know he's watching a clone? Yes, right. But Olivier definitely knows. Ok? He's the one that we need to get to. You mind if I get through Paul first? Sarah? I'll sleep on the couch. Donnie. Donnie, Donnie... (Alison sighs.) You're right. Everyone deserves their privacy. Come. I thought you handed in your sidearm. Huh? Left jacket pocket, hanging low. Well, apparently I've got a stalker. Sit. Put it on the table. I knew. I couldn't put my finger on it, but I knew. It was that day you were supposed to do the hearing, first time we had s*x in months. What? I missed you. You were wearing that clash t-shirt. (Laughing): I was like, what? And then, wham, you screw me right on the kitchen counter. Are you complaining, Paul? What are you saying? You quite the force after refusing ever even to think it. You know what I've been through. And then the scar on your neck just disappears because of what? Some cream? And now... This little girl. I was there when Beth found out she couldn't have kids. So who was this girl? She's my half-sister. I watched you together. She's your daughter, isn't she? You're losing it. Am I? Well, I was looking at some old video today. You were training for that half marathon. What was the last race you were in? What city was it in? Where is Beth? One last time. Whoever you are... where is Beth? She killed herself. She jumped in front of a train. You're English. Who are you? I'm her twin. Twin? Is this a test? A test of what? Beth didn't have a sister. What's your name? Sarah. Sarah what? Sarah's good enough. When Beth died, I took her identity. Beth isn't dead. Look, I was just gonna clean out her bank accounts. I didn't mean to get all tangled up with you. If she really is dead, how do I know you didn't kill her? 'Cause you killed her. What? You're her monitor, aren't you? And what's that? You observe her. You let people into her home. Like last night. Doctors came and medically examined her in her sleep. And she knew. You're a plant, and she killed herself because the man that she loved turned her whole life into a lie. She knew you didn't love her, and she couldn't understand why you wouldn't leave. And now she figured it out. This isn't true. This is a test. Isn't it? Isn't it? She trusted you. How could you do that to her? You think I had a choice? Just tell me why. They don't tell us why.
