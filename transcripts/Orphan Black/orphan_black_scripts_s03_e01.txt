 I saw a girl kill herself. 
 She looked exactly like me. 
 It's you with a nice haircut. 
 I've got to go up to her flat. 
 Beth. Something's different. 
 We're clones. We're like lab rats in an illegal experiment. 
 There's nine of you. 
 No, there's only one of me. 
 If it were my experiment, I would put an observer close to the subject to keep tabs and accumulate data. 
 The age of biotechnology is upon us. 
 The DYAD group spans the globe. 
 There is a painless way to reunite with Kira. 
 Surrender yourself. You have to promise to protect me and my daughter. 
 I promise. 
 Someone is killing us. 
 Alison : Why would one of us be killing us? 
 I'm your mother. I had twins. 
 One to the state and one to the church. 
 Helena. 
 Helena's going to be a part of our family now. 
 He puts babies in all these women? 
 Yes. To multiply is divine. 
 Felix : Did you burn down the fish people's ranch? 
 We are going to come to terms. 
 You don't own us. 
 We're sick. 
 Your little girls are dying. 
 I want the key to your cipher. 
 Kira : Professor Duncan gave it to me. 
 Aah! 
 You may kiss the bride. 
 Sarah will never forgive me. 
 Restricted intellectual property. 
 They patented us. 
 Marion : While DYAD carried female clones, the military faction carried the males. 
 Sarah : You sure you want to know what this is all about?

 ["Wouldn't it be nice" plays in foreign language] 
 [Giggles] 
 Oi, meathead, I don't think those are gonna fit. 
 They are very little. 
 Maybe you can wear them on your fingers. 
 They're not for her, silly! Helena's going to have a little monkey, too! 
 Monkey number two. 
 [Laughing] 
 Felix, that ox liver smells fantastic! 
 Doesn't it? 
 It's our  sestra's  favorite. 
 Marinated in  horilka  all day. 
 Mm, that'll go perfectly with these. 
 Are you going to say thank you? 
 Thank you,  sestra  Alison. 
 Oh, heavens, just a few things I've made. 
 This is your special day, Helena. 
 You and your precious cargo. 
 Dude, you look awesome. 
 You look awesome also. 
 Sestra,  you are well? 
 Oh, yeah, I'm, like, way better thanks to science. 
 Check it out! 
 Babka cake. 
 Mm-hmm. 
 Kielbasa.

 [Music distorts, slows, stops] [Thunder rumbles] [Hissing] [Gasps] Aah! Aah! Aah! Aaaaah! Aaaaaah! Aah! [Gasps] [Breathing erratically] [Grunting] [Panting] Woman's voice : Relax, Helena. You remember me, don't you? Yes, Pupok. It's been a long time. You're being tested again. And this time you're carrying a child. It's hot here. I can taste sand. [Sniffs] They took me from my sestras. No one said it was going to be easy, kiddo. [Monitor beeping] [Boat horn blares] Kira : Are there still fish in the water? Yeah, big sleepy fish 'cause we never come to visit. Darling, why don't you go take a stroll down the bend, see if you can find some fish. Mm-hmm. Not too far. Mm-hmm. See if you can find the monkeyfish. [Laughs] Okay! It has been a while since we've come back to shite beach. I think it was your memorial. That was lovely, Vic spoke. Can we just enjoy this please? Enjoy military boy clones with scars all over their faces? Don't pretend this is over, Sarah. Marion's handling it. Marion has already buggered off to Europe. To cover for us. She's controlling DYAD, she's the only reason I got out. Nothing is benevolent with these people, Sarah, you know it. We've seen it time and again. Who's that? What'd I tell you, Sarah? The penny's going to drop. Kira, come here. It's Delphine. God, she looks good! Delphine : Until three weeks ago we didn't even know Project Castor existed. They were a myth. But now they're a bomb, and shock waves are coming. These guys aren't my problem. I'm sorry, they are. Rachel has powerful friends, and you put a pencil in her eye. Listen, please. There are threats to LEDA from outside and in, and Marion, she sent me, yes, to protect DYAD, but to keep your sisters safe... Right. At any cost. Have you even talked to your girlfriend yet? I need to show you how we caught him. [Indistinct conversation] Who's that? [Elevator bell dings] Her name is Krystal Goderitch. I don't want to see this sh1t. It gets worse. Another one. We intercepted them as they were forcing her into the trunk of a car. Now, Krystal was lucky, she lived. But this one killed two members of the security team and the other one got away. Why? What are they after? He hasn't told us so much as his name. And now he says he'll only talk with you. [Buzzer] Well, here I am. You're a legend, Sarah Manning. You got a name or a serial number or some sh1t I can call you? You're made of the good stuff, aren't you? Krystal had no idea what she was made of. Found the whole concept very confusing. I never met her. No, but you met Alison and Cosima. And the rest, as they say at DYAD is... C'est l'histoire! What do you want with us? The walls have ears. Come closer. I'll whisper it to you. I met one of your brothers, too. I think I know which one. I kicked him in the face. [Laughing] You think that's funny? He wasn't a soldier. He was a Prolethean. Was he? It's hard to tell who's who these days. I mean what is the wild one doing with DYAD? I'm not with DYAD. Well, you're trusting the wrong people. I only trust my sisters. Oh, I know, it's a family affair. With Felix, and your step mum, Mrs. Sadler, and, of course... Little Kira. A child. Hmm... How special you are. You talk about my family, you come near them, I will kill you. Put her out. Put her out now! [Buzzer] Sarah... Count your sisters. Alison : I'm fine, Sarah, thank you for asking. But any boy clone who crosses the Hendrixes is gonna get his butt kicked. Girls! No bunching! What about you, fee? We're doing fine. We're just hanging out here with my new roomie, Cosima. Oh, fish sticks! Ref! Ref! Re... I'm sorry, I have to go. I have to go, Sarah. Bye. Cosima's temperature's down She's actually got a bit of color in her cheeks. And Helena? Helena's an albino. Cosima : Tell Sarah that Helena hasn't come back. What? Is she talking to Delphine? Is she with Delphine? Um, Cosima's telling me to tell you  Helena still hasn't shown up. Oh, sh1t.  And I think her bag's gone. I've got a bad feeling about this. Well, what do you want us to do about it? [Sighs] Um, meet me at S's, yeah? Okay. Bye. Yeah? Okay. Helena's missing. No, no, you and I, we have other priorities. No, we don't. My priority's my sister, and you're going to see Cosima. I warned you about a threat from within. Topside is sending an investigator to DYAD to assess the security risks posed by you and your sisters. That's your problem. No, it's our problem. The man that is coming is a cleaner. He cannot find out what we did to Rachel. So you're gonna have to play your part. What part? You have to play Rachel. Oh, piss off, Delphine. Sarah, please, we are in this together. I'm leaving and you're not stopping me, are you? [Sighs] [Door slams] Alison : Yeah? Okay, so I'm going to send you, you sit at the very back, okay, with your sister. I sit with her. Yeah, you guys sit together. Hi! Hi! Driving the Soccer Stars bus? Look at you, helping out. Hi, Marci. What can I do for you? Well, don't worry, I'm not trying to list your house. It's election time again, so can I count on your support for school trustee? You're the incumbent, I'm pretty sure you're safe, Marci. Honestly, Alison, I am so inspired by your recovery. You are still a... Community leader in Bailey Downs. And you know what? Maybe, in exchange for just a smidge of campaigning, I could help revive your monthly potluck. Um... I heard you plan to tinker electoral boundaries, taking Bailey Downs out of the Glendale School District. Well, uh, that's just one possibility, yes. That would mean my kids have to change schools. So instead of supporting you, I've been thinking of running against you. Really? Yeah. [Laughs] So, best of luck to you. Okay, up you get! Everybody on! Let's go! What are you doing here? I finally did it, Ali. I finally told Susan Teller what was what. Oh, my God, you got fired. It was frickin' glorious. I called her a bitch... Shh! To her face. Donnie, that's enough. What? People are watching. Shush your mouth, and I will see you at home. Uh... They took the keys to the Taurus. Honey, they took my Taurus. Dad? Why are you here? Okay, inside. Inside, okay? Good, Gemma. Okay! Everybody, hands in, windows up! On the bus, Donnie. Get on the bus. Okay. Hi, everybody! Aah! You know my face? Never had the pleasure. That's not what I asked. Ugh! Honestly, I... I don't know you, son. [Chuckles] Think hard. One... Of a kind. You're a Castor? Professor Ethan Duncan was here. Major Dierden agreed that Project Castor would leave me and mine out of this. I'm not under Dierden's orders. So where is Duncan now? With DYAD? You're making your big entrance too late, love. Duncan went in to DYAD. Cared for it so little he made himself dead. All right. His research. Where is it? It's at DYAD, I assume. You're not the sharpest knife in the box, are you? Ugh! Dr. Nealon : The eye was lost. She sustained some trauma to the frontal lobe. It's too early to predict... Impairment. Topside is sending ferdinand. He lands in three hours. Topside took action on LEDA before. There was an incident in 2006. Helsinki. Yes. Marion briefed me... I'm here so it doesn't happen again. I've talked to Sarah. She mustn't uncover Helsinki. Not even Rachel knows. Can I count on you, Dr. Nealon, to put LEDA above its individuals? Neither of us can afford to play favorites now, can we? No, we can't. Felix : [Echoing] Siobhan! Sarah : sh1t! Can you hear us? Two bloody boy clones in one day. What the hell is it that they want all of a sudden? Well, this one wanted Duncan. His "research." [Sighs] I'm sorry, mum. Sarah, I made... I made a wartime decision. It's only a matter of time before you find out. What have you done? It was the only way I could see to get you out of DYAD. Marion wanted Castor information, and Paul wanted something in return. Helena? [Sighs] It was what I had to do at the time. What, betray my sister? Give her to them? For Kira. That is not your bloody decision, S, is it?! Does DYAD know about this? Did Cal? No. It was Paul's demand, I... I had to choose. Sarah, stop. Sarah... don't, don't. Please! Don't turn your back on me, not on your people. You're not my people. [Door opens, closes] Great. [Sobs] Stick me in the middle with a bloody apple in my mouth. Felix, go after her. Don't let her make it worse. She's gonna make it worse, she will. But right now, I need to get you to a hospital, so I'm calling Benjamin. This girl just fell on her face. Ouch! Like, there's a cliff and there's barely any water at the bottom. Hey, can I ask you something? Yeah. Do you, um... Remember when you were... Waking me up to tell me to read that story to you? Yeah. Yeah? I was having this dream where I was like... Way above, and I could see below. And then I came back... To you. Did you feel that thing? I don't know. Yeah, I don't know, too. I don't really have words for what I'm trying to say. You had to come back so Delphine could make you better with my stem cells. [Knock on door] Delphine : Hello, Cosima? It's me. Hey! Hi. [Sighs] I'm so happy you're back. I only have, um, a minute, so... Oh, okay. Just a minute? You're not wearing your cannula. Are you feeling okay? Yeah, I'm fine. Don't... don't mother me. What's going on? I'm looking for Sarah. Is she... is she here? Because, uh, she won't answer my calls. No. I'm sorry, this, um... This Rachel problem is very... Critical, so I need her help. You just talk to me? I am taking over some of Rachel's duties. So I won't be... Working with you and Scott... For a while. So you're the new Rachel. Awesome. Cosima... I'm keeping my promise to love all of your sisters equally. But to do that, I can't do this. Do you understand? Okay, I get it. Your minute's up, you should probably just go. Look, we all have our part to play. Me, Sarah, Alison. But yours is to cure. Yourself and all of your sisters. I love you. Scott is gonna come to do a checkup. Okay. 
 
 [Sobbing] Oh, my God! [Sobbing] [Sniffles, sobbing] Well, I've run the numbers. You can't run from numbers, Donnie. We have one mortgage payment left. Well, we're not taking from our retirement fund. Look, look, look... I've got $347.82 in expenses from when I was a monitor. So that's good. Plus I'm incredibly employable. But you know, honey, I was thinking maybe you could... [Sighs] Work with your mom again part time at Bubbles for a bit. I will dig ditches for this family, but I am not going back to work at my mother's store. Besides I have a bee in my bonnet. I want to run for school trustee. You do? Well, Marci Coates wants to change the district boundaries. I know. I heard she's manipulating real estate prices. Yes! Yeah, Marci's got to go. Mm-hmm. For the kids. Yes. [Mobile buzzing] Oh, it's DYAD. There was an emergency, Sarah's up to her eyeballs. Is she okay? Hello? Delphine. How could S do that to Helena? I mean, who am I meant to call family now? You can't put them all under your wing. What should I do? Should I abandon her? Just like everyone else has done her entire life? For you and Kira, I'd have done the same thing. I'd have done the same thing that Siobhan did. Leave S out of it, please? [Mobile ringing] This is the other thing. Delphine. Delphine's got your number? Well, we definitely need new clone phones. She wants my help "saving" LEDA and DYAD. Jesus, don't these people know you never finished high school? Piss off! Maybe she can help me. Help you? With what? Help you with Helena? Yeah. Please don't. Please. Hi, Delphine. I won't condone this, Delphine. Rachel's a stretch for her. It will be brief. Ferdinand knows Rachel, but it's... it's my meeting. You can just say hello and then excuse yourself. You've a cleaner named Ferdinand? You don't think I can do this? Rachel Duncan, uber-bitch. That was terrible. If you're gonna do this, then you need to wear white. Okay? White dazzles, God knows you'll need distraction. Yeah, that's good. The deal is you're going to help me with Helena, yeah. Don't say yes. Yes. But let's take it one step at a time. Well, Castor has her, so what are you going to do about that? Everything I can. But first, we need to get through this inquisition. Ferdinand can't sense anything amiss. If we falter, he will smell it. Well, don't falter, Delphine. Give us some space, I have to change. Hmm! Hmm! 96 over 60. Hey! So your blood pressure's pretty good. Yeah. How's your heart? Oh... I'm done with the French. Seriously, Cosima... With soldier clones running around, and you know, all this lesbian drama, uh, I don't know that I want to work on the super-secret sh1t anymore. Okay. Yeah, I get it. Um, but you might want to check this out. [Clears throat] The Island of Dr. Moreau. Yeah, it's a gift from Professor Duncan. Dude! This could be... His key. To unlock the rest of the synthetic sequences. Mm-hmm. Does Delphine know you have this? I've learned from DYAD that secrets are power. And until you and I decipher it, no one is gonna know about it, not even my sisters. And hold. Welcome to the DYAD Institute. Enjoy your oophorectomy. Ferdinand? Welcome. Delphine Cormier. Dr. Cormier, yes. Rachel? Nice to see you again, Ferdinand. I'm so sorry, I'm between flights. I need you both. Please. In the light of the Castor revelation, topside has engaged me to conduct a security review of DYAD. We understand. Marion has held a living, breathing Castor subject in her basement for three weeks. Yes. Without reporting it. I believe she needed genetic confirmation. Like you, I've only just been brought up to speed. Who else is aware? Dr. Nealon, Rachel, and myself. We are the only ones in the loop. Paul Dierden? It appears he was a Castor mole. You let him get right next to you. He was her monitor. Dr. Leekie put him there. You have consent over your monitors. I consented, yes. To Dr. Leekie's choice. There's more. Castor has kidnapped Helena, Sarah Manning's maternal twin. [Chuckles] Is this true? Yes. You're holding Sarah Manning, correct? Yes. I'd like to question her. Is that really necessary? It is... Necessary. Whatever you need. After you, Rachel. Holy doodle, here we go. Oi, oi, Rachel. Shut up. Never gets old, does it? Yeah, it does. Take it as a compliment, Miss Manning. You have a face to fight wars for. But when the wild seed blows back into the fold with something like Castor on her heels, I get suspicious. What's Castor? What's that? Sarah, this is very important. In all your unmonitored wanderings through our murky history... What? Have you ever met a male clone? Delphine : Answer the question. No, no! Why, are you one? No? Never met a soldier boy? No whisperings from Professor Duncan? No, no. I've only met my sisters. "Sisters"? Yeah. You really are the wild one, aren't you? Tell me, Rachel, 50 years from now, you think your kind will still be calling each other sister? I would hope we'd just be another person in the checkout line. [Laughs] Jolly good. What are you doing? What are you doing? Ferdinand, please. Ah, ah, ah! Wh-what's happening? I thought you were recovering from surgery. Get your hands off me, you pig! You watch your mouth! [Laughs] Ferdinand, may we have a word? We had to postpone the oophorectomy. Your goal is to isolate her fecundity ASAP. Why are you waiting? I'm not a doctor. You cannot remove the ovary of a woman who is ovulating. I know it's inconvenient, but she's contained. No risk to topside. Then remove her to her cell, please. I know you're lying. About flying anywhere tonight. [Sighs] Was that for my benefit or hers? I wouldn't attempt to pull the wool over your eyes, Ferdinand. [Chuckles] I am surprised that your nemesis is still breathing. Why did you let him do that? Shh! Not getting cold feet are you? Things are already in motion. Sarah's biology is too unique to waste. So, by the way, is Helena's. We need to locate her. We... Need to discuss Helsinki. [Sighs] Well, I want to discuss Helena. Then I'll come to you tonight, when I'm finished here, all right? I look forward to it. He's doing it again. Guy thinks he's the naked Buddha. I'm doing my rounds, I'll be back. Look, don't... don't worry about me, guys. Okay? Sarah, these people are dangerous. I thought Mr. rubber gloves was going to throttle me on the spot. I know, I'm sorry. I just don't believe that Helena's a priority for Delphine. We have to make our own moves. No, you're right. We can't rely on anybody but ourselves. We should... we should go after her, the poor thing. No! No, no, no, you tell Sarah I don't want you doing anything like this ever again. Shh, shh... [Knock on door] I got to go. Be careful, Sarah. Hey, I love you guys. Yeah, me, too. Hello again. [Monitor beeping] Hello, Rachel. I warned you this was personal. What day is it, hmm? M... d... What's my name? Night... Come on. What? What happened to my c... Corn cob. Aw, come on, come on, you can do better than that. Aah! Aah! [Gasps] What's my name? Stop, stop, Delphine! There! There we go. There you go, good girl. Only I'm you now, you understand that? I'm you... And I will erase you completely, Rachel, unless you tell me what you're planning with Ferdinand. Ferdinand? Yeah. What have you got going on with him? And don't lie, because I saw it. You... You saw... You saw... Come on! Helsinki... Oh. You wicked sister. You're not supposed to know about that. No. What else do you know? Hmm? [Monitor beeping rapidly] You're gonna talk to me? [Whines] Hmm? You gonna talk to me? Drink? Same as last time. At the Kronenhalle Bar. You've come all this way, why not try some local color? Rachel... Rachel, Rachel... Why haven't you been returning my calls? Appearances, Ferdinand. Bourbon, rocks. So, the subject was Helena. You're not yourself. Did you sleep with Paul Dierden? He was my monitor. What do you think? I think... He was your bitch. [Gasps] [Exhales deeply] Hello again. Who's a dirty clone? You are. You're avoiding Helena. I want you to consider a prisoner swap with Castor. Argh! It's got nothing to do with Castor, this is about Helsinki. You wanted this! Marion is too soft, you said it yourself. If we didn't act, your sisters could expose topside. Helsinki's the only option. There are other options. No, it's too late. Be strong, huh? The Helsinki girls were eradicated in 24 hours. 6 clones, 32 collateral. As soon as you have Sarah's ovaries, put her down. Induce Cosima tomorrow, she'll deteriorate rapidly. And Alison Hendrix? It's underway. The family chloroformed, followed by a house fire. [Chuckles] Proven effective by the Finns. Excuse me. I need a moment. [Breathing erratically] [Buzzing] Pick up! Hello, you've reached Alison Hendrix, I'm away from the phone, but leave a message and I'll get back to you in a jiff. [Beep] Alison, get out of your house now. Take the kids and get... [Door opens] Who are you talking to in here? No... no one. What game are you playing, Rachel? Hmm? What are you up to? I don't know what you're talking about. Something is going on. If you're not careful, Helsinki will swallow you too... And you won't get what you want. I want my sisters spared. No. You want the child. Don't you? More than anything? So... If you're having second thoughts, remember Kira. Please... Poor, damaged Rachel. What happened to you? Hmm? Who's behind that face? You don't recognize me, Ferdinand? No. Do you recognize me now? Yes! Ah! Ha ha ha! Do you recognize me now? Yes. Yes, yes. Pull it. Ah! Remember our safe word? No. Aah! Ah! Ah. [Cat meows] [Grunting, gasping] Stop! Come on, stop! Come on. Get up, go. [Gasps] What is this? Shut up and stop squirming. I am sanctioned by topside... To conduct a security review of self-aware clones. Not screw our product. Helsinki's happening, Delphine. Won't Marion be impressed? Conspiring with one clone to murder the others. Now who will pay for this, hmm? Her? Topside's favorite pet? Or you, Ferdinand? Because they will kill you. What do you want? [Door closes] Marion will meet us in Zurich. You report to topside that DYAD is secure. And self-aware LEDA clones, an essential evolution of the program. I know how leverage works. Good, wait for me downstairs. Rachel... [Sighs] Rachel was going to eliminate us. Everybody we love. Yes. They've done it before. You should have told me. I only did this for Helena. I know. I counted on it. You said you'd help me find her. I already am. But until I figure out what Castor really is, you need to stand down. Don't try anything else. I'll be back. [Door opens, closes] My legs hurt. Picture a box, inside a box inside a box. [Knock on door] She's been in almost 48 hours. All right. In you go. Congratulations, you escaped the first box. I swear this guy's from another world or something. Hello, brother. This season on BBC America's "Orphan Black"... [Banging] We're hunting. Cosima : Untraceable. The perfect ghost soldiers. I have to find something for them. It's not too late to reconsider this. Your family sold you out. Man : You're not in a position to make demands. Five... Four... Aah! Three... Two... One. [Gunshot]
