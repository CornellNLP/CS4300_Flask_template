 I quit! 
 [Gunshot] 
 Rachel: Aldous suffered a fatal heart attack on one of our jets. 
 I have never been more attracted to you than I am right now. 
 I'd like you to take over as interim director. 
 The disease is spreading too rapidly. 
 But if we can reboot her immune system... 
 With my kid's bone marrow? 
 For the embryos. 
 My father is the father. I'm carrying your babies. 
 You had to put your own child inside of her? 
 Henrik: Don't. Do this. Helena! 
 We're not safe here. 
 Where are you going to take her? 
 Pleasure to meet you, Felix. 
 What have you done? 
 [Sobbing] 
 I know how frightening this must be for you. 
 You may even grow to like it here. 
 Just as I did. 
 Do you have any known allergies? 
 Are you taking any prescription medication? 
 In the first place, giving her bone marrow, the child! She's 8 years old! 
 [Shouting] 
 And she is gone because... 
 I should've known. 
 Giving me that attitude for half your bloody life! 
 What do you think... she is 8 years old. 
 She doesn't get a choice in any of this! 
 What is your sexual orientation? Do you now, or have you ever used intravenous drugs? 
 How many sexual partners? Are you ovulating? 
 I don't know. Are you ovulating? 
 I don't know! 
 I left her with you for 5 bloody minutes! 
 I cannot go over it again and again, Sarah. I thought it was you! 
 She looked like you. She was with... 
 Man: When did you first have sexual intercourse? 
 14, 15. 
 Have you ever had an STD? 
 No. 
 Have you ever been diagnosed with a reproductive disorder? 
 No. 
 Have you ever had an abortion? 
 Have you ever had an abortion? 
 [Voice breaks] Yeah. 
 Have you ever been diagnosed with mental illness? 
 No. 
 Do you use birth control? 
 Sometimes, yeah. 
 Siobhan: Be strong, child. 
 I don't know whose side you're on. 
 But I know  you always put Kira first. 
 And we'll do that now. 
 But, first, we need to get Felix checked by a doctor. 
 Felix. 
 Felix, honey, you... 
 We have to get you for the toxicology test. 
 No, not a chance. I'm fine. 
 No. No, love. We can't be sure what you've had. 
 We don't know... Sarah, you've got to tell him. 
 Sarah. 
 My name is Sarah Manning. 
 Speak up, please. 
 [Raises voice] My name is Sarah Manning and this is my unconditional surrender. 
 Good morning, Miss Manning. 
 My name is Dr. Nealon. 
 [Beep] 
 Nice to see you again. 
 "Again"? 
 At our first encounter, I thought you were Beth Childs. 
 Your bloodwork told us otherwise. 
 You examined me in my sleep. 
 I'm glad that will no longer be necessary. 
 You began menstruation very young. 
 Look, I'm going to cooperate, but I want to see my kid. 
 Kira's fine. 
 [Sniff] 
 You have my word. 
 [Sigh] 
 Come on, honey. It won't hurt. 
 It's just cotton. 
 Mnh-mnh. 
 Please? 
 There. 
 All done. 
 [Door opens, closes] 
 [Ring] 
 Cal: Hello? Hey! You can't take that! Hey! [Crying] We just finished processing that material, Martin. And your transplant has been booked. The marrow's being sent directly to Dr. Nealon. What? Who's Dr. Nealon? Your new physician. What? I have a new physician? Dr. Cormier didn't tell you? This is all on Rachel's orders. Effective immediately, you'll no longer be working with the clones. Frankfurt. And if I refuse? You'll be on the plane. You have everything you wanted. Everything DYAD wanted. You used me! Please, let me say goodbye to Cosima. Cosima will be well-cared-for and Sarah's procedure is imminent. You forget, Dr. Cormier... None of this is personal. I love her and, if you let her die without me, it is personal. Scott: No one is more familiar with her illness than Delphine. We need her. Dr. Nealon has all of Dr. Cormier's records. She'll get the best possible care. [Alert chimes] She had the best care! You took it away. This is not a debate, Mr. Smith. If you wish to remain involved... Um, Martin? Ahem. [Breathlessly] Scott, just... Can you tell Dr. Nealon that I am really excited to work with him. Is there anything that I can do for Sarah? I just don't want anybody to get hurt. Maybe, if I can't see Sarah, then I can see Kira? You know, she's just a little kid and it'd be a nice gesture from you guys, you know, we can foster cooperation. I'll see what I can do. Awesome. Thank you. What are you up to? I don't know, yet. Cosima, we should really leave. Yeah, I know. We probably should. But they're planning something for Sarah. Delphine just sent me Rachel's itinerary. So, we know where she's going to be? And we know where Sarah's going to be. In 16 days, when you begin to ovulate, we would like to harvest your eggs. You would? Yes. Well, I would like to see my daughter. Sign consent to the procedure and I will make that happen. Look at me. Do I really need to sign? Does that really matter? Tsk. Bureaucracy. Take me to her. You want some tea? Hello, sweetheart. Are you comfortable? Is my mum here yet? Soon. I hope. The last time I saw your mother, Do you know what that means? No. It means she wasn't very nice to me. And then, she kept running away. Just as she ran from you, so many times. Did that make you sad? Yeah. But she says she's all grown up now. [Chuckle] I hope she is. Even mothers have to do as they're told, sometimes. Don't they? Siobhan: Absolutely not. What part of this are you not understanding?! N- no, you listen. Amber alert is not an option. If I say you're making a car bomb, you will bloody well make a car bomb. I will call you back. Who was that? That was... That was nobody that you need to know. [Banging on door] Hey. Mrs. S? Who are you? I'm Cal. I'm Kira's father. Kira called me this morning. And when did she give you this? For Christ's sake, Siobhan. I can vouch for him. After 8 years, you finally meet Kira's dad. You don't even tell me... Oh, yes, let's do open a rollicking debate about keeping secrets! Shall we? Guys, guys. Why don't we? Please, can you put the gun down? Look, Sarah never told me anything, okay? I just kind of figured it out. Genetic identicals. Kira knows it too, even though she doesn't really know what it means. I'm here to help. I did a lot of digging on DYAD. He's handy that way. Is he? [Ringtone] [Ring] Arthur, what can you tell me? Well, I can tell you I just came home to find someone at my table. What do you mean? Who? She's eating. Hello, sestra brother. I want to see Sarah. Holy sh1t. Helena's back. Do not tell her about Sarah. Art, have you told her anything? No, of course not. I want you over there, Felix. She is too unpredictable. Hang on just a second. Me? Yes, you! Ohh, God. Just keep feeding her, Art, all right? I'm going to be there as soon as I can. Yeah. Bye. Just keep her on ice, clear? Do not let Helena out of your sight. Okay. Duncan. Sarah. Don't despair, my dear. Don't despair. I fell in love with a boy called Jesse. But, after bar fighting, he had to go to war and become a tow-truck driver. O- kay. Okay, look, there was a fire at the Johanssen Ranch last night. Do you know anything about that? No. Helena. Pbbbbbt. Did you burn down the fish people's ranch? No. When do I see Sarah? Soon. She said that Kira can't wait to see you. After my heart was broken, I became roommates to a very good girl. Okay. So tell me about that. She had a crisis of faith. Mark: What's done is done, Gracie. We can start fresh. Am I a sinner for wishing my father dead? He deserved it. God's just gonna have to deal with the both of us, then, isn't he? Yes, he will. Because we're together now. That means the child inside you, too. The DYAD group has these key people on dozens of corporate boards, you know. I'm talking superpacs and research groups and lobbyists. All a concerted effort to try and effect biogenetic patent law. I can use the internet, actually, Cal. No, you can't. No offense. Well, what have you discovered? Well, it's not what, it's who. Someone from DYAD tried to hack me, so I hacked them back. I followed this person on darknet and I saw them asking the same questions as me. Jesus, you fell for that? But they had real information... Project LEDA, clones. And they know I'm Kira's father. I think this is an insider. And high up, too. They get to you, they get to Kira. They already have Kira. And, yet, this person is still here. They're there now? Can you help? Come on. Just... Tell them you're with Siobhan Sadler. With Siovan... It's with a "bh". Oops. Sorry about that. Come on. "Castor"? Does that mean anything to you? Don't know your mythology, do you, Cal? Luckily, you're not the only person with an inside man. Well. I didn't peg you for a major, back at prof Duncan's house. I wasn't. A lot has changed since I came back in. But you are still prepared to play double agent? Like you, I want to know the truth. I'm impressed, Paul. I'll be impressed if you can actually pull this off. Cup of tea while we wait? "Suddenly I heard a thud and a hissing behind me and, looking round, sprang to my feet with a cry of horror. Against the warm dawn great tumultuous masses of black smoke "were boiling up out of the enclosure... " Are you enjoying yourself? "Shot flickering threads of blood-red flame." I've brought tea. Just hot water, for me. Brought my own bag. A spurt of fire jetted from the window of my room. I remembered the crash I had heard. When I had rushed out to Montgomery's assistance...  Do you remember this day? As often as possible. It's a day I would've never seen, had it not been for your synthetic sequences. And, yet, Martin tells me, you've encoded them with a nonrepeating substitution cypher. Why would you deny existence to more of us? We're your life's work. I've given you the sequence to help Cosima. Cure her, and we'll talk about unlocking another. Unlock another,  and we'll talk about curing Cosima. Well, since none of us seem to know what you're actually for, I think your attempts to make new clones should meet with failure. I want the key to your cypher. I've had 20 years to work on it. It's rather good. Where is it? Is it with Sarah's people? My dear, I didn't write it down. You know I can recite PI  to 6,000 places. Do you recall, Rachel, not the memory, but the feeling of [crying] How much we loved you? [Crying] The reason I watch these tapes so often is because I don't remember at all. [Clatter] What... what have you done? What have you done? My poor, poor Rachel. No! My poor, poor Rachel. Why? No. It w... It won't take long. No no no. No. No. You can't leave me again. [Sobbing] You can't leave me again! No! I'm afraid you don't deserve me anymore. [Asphyxiating] Martin! [Laughing] So you know what I need if this gets Sarah out of there. I'm well aware. This should be interesting. All right, they're willing. Paul, meet Cal. He's Kira's father. Hi, Paul. [Laughs] What's so funny? Oh, you're a friend of Sarah's. Just look at the two of you. I don't know how she does it. Okay, what's happening now? We are hoping that there are still good people in the most corrupt places. You, the monitor, Paul Dierden. Yeah. I think I know who you are. Apparently, we're both willing to risk our necks to get to the bottom of this, hmm? Castor. You guarantee that Sarah and her daughter will be released and protected. I can get them out. The rest is up to Sarah. You like your new dolls, Kira? No, not really. No? [Cough] Do you want to do some science? Science class? Yeah, it's my favorite. Pure science. You want to do it? Yeah. Okay. We're going to do an experiment. I want you to try to push your favorite pencil through this paper. Okay? See if you can do it. Oops. How come that didn't work? I wonder. 'Cause you know what? You need more...? Force. Okay? So force equals mass, pbbt!, times pyew! Acceleration. How can we get the pencil through this paper, do you think? We need to make it sharper? That's a really good idea. High-five for that. What about trying speed? Maybe? Acceleration? Should we give that a shot? [Gasp] Nice one! You won the experiment. You won science. You're a scientist now. 
 
 You want to make a picture for your mom? Yeah. Okay. Maybe we can explain to her what we learned today. Hey. Oh oh oh oh. Cosima. I'm okay. I'm... sorry. I'm okay. Cosima, it's not going to work. It has to work. She needs us. Cosima. Hey. Hey. Let me do this. Where'd you get that? We're only going to get one chance. [Door opens] What's going on? Let go. Let go! What are you doing? Why are you doing this? Woman: Okay, here she comes. [Squeaking] No, move that to the other side. [Vitals monitor beeps rapidly] Please. Man: I got a pulse. One. Hey. What are you going to do? Cosima says hey. We're going to help you get out of here. Just... What is this? We're performing an oophorectomy. A what?! We're removing one of you ovaries. For research. Bullshit, you are! That's not what I signed. You'll still have one. We don't wish to render you infertile. On the contrary. I hope you look forward to another pregnancy as much as we do. Dr. Nealon. Ms. Duncan. I'd like a second to speak to my sister, please. 2 minutes. Everybody, stay prepped. Woman: Okay, everybody out. Kira gave me something for you. You psycho. She also gave her bone marrow to cure Cosima. Duncan is dead. What? He took his own life. But I know he gave you the key to the synthetic sequences, didn't he? What key? To his cypher. He wrote them down for you. I don't know what you're talking about. Rachel, I don't know. No? Enjoy your oophorectomy. We will continue this when you're done. Rachel. I'll tell you. Good. Where is it? Where has he written it? Right here. Aah! Aah! Aah-aah! Go. Get Kira. Go! Oh. Mummy! She's ready. I was just about to get you. You're free to go. You don't have to run. I'm very impressed by you, Sarah, by both you and your mother. Who are you? My name is Marian Bowles. I'm from topside. I've opened the doors, but this does not end with Rachel. Sarah, if you ever want to stop running, if you want the truth, if you want to know what this is really all about, then you meet me tomorrow, hmm? Cal can arrange it. He's downstairs, waiting to take you home to your sisters. Well, tonight was certainly informative. Give me five. Later, Cal. Take care. Yeah. Nice to meet you. He's hot. Pssh. Well, that's us. Yeah, well, it's a pretty standard group of sisters. Yeah, I think so. Um, I'm going to be around, okay? I want to help with Kira, getting the marrow, and stuff. I don't think we can do that again for another 6 weeks. Oh. So I don't know what's going to happen to Cosima. Um... I'm sorry about that. Whatever you did to get Marian Bowles, thank you for doing that. Don't thank me, okay? I'm not doing this for thanks. I'm doing it because I need... [Door squeaks open] [Door closes] Oh, hello, steamy potatoes. Hey. Cal. Yeah. You're not going to be bringing all that game into my bed, I hope. [Snicker] No, unfortunately not. It's clones-only tonight. I know. That means me, too. See ya later. Bye. Bye. Bye. Listen, I don't know if this is a good idea or not, because it's crazy, but Art has someone downstairs who really wants to meet her sisters. Felix: Helena. Oh, my God. This is your sister, Cosima. You should not be up. I'm up. Come here. You're very beautiful. Thank you. I like your hairs. [Laughing] Oh, thanks. I like your hairs, too. Helena, this is your other sister, Alison. Hello, Helena. Lovely to meet you. Pleased to meet you, too. [Chuckle] You are married? Yes. Oh, yes, very much so. To Donnie. I will be married, too, one day. Well, it's very rewarding, if you can get through the rough patches. Auntie Helena! We thought you ran away from us. I came back to see your little face. I'm so happy to see you, I'm going to eat your finger. [Giggle] [Snorting] No! She all right? Yeah. [Reggae plays] ♪ Oh oh oh (Oh oh oh)! ♪ Hmm. [Laughs] Yeah. No, unh-unh. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. Come on. Come on. Whoa. [Laughing] Wow, Helena. Wow! Whoa! [Laughing] Oh, my God. [Laughs] [Laughs] Sarah: Eh, monkey! Alison: Whoo-hoo! Go, Kira! [Laughs] Whoo! Whoo! Hey. What were you thinking about? Oh, like Buckminster Fuller and sacred geometry. [Chuckle] Look. So this spiral, this is the golden ratio and it's a mathematical pattern that just repeats itself in nature, in flower petals and honeybees and, you know, the stars in the galaxy and in every molecule of our DNA. God, we're so different, all of us. Yeah. I know. I don't even know how to look at art. Don't tell Fee. I won't. You're the wild type, Sarah. You propagate against all odds. You know, you're restless. You survive. I can't do this without you, Cosima. [Sniffle] It'll be fine. [Sniffle] Yeah. We just have to keep moving forward. Forward through the looking-glass with Marian bloody Bowles. What could go wrong? [Both chuckle] Mmm. [Electricity crackles] Auntie Cosima. Auntie Cosima. Auntie Cosima! Don't be afraid. [Heartbeat] I will never leave you. Hello. Will you read me a story? Mm-hmm. Hello? Hello. [Giggling] Hey. [Giggle] Are you hiding? [Giggle] Charlotte. It's Sarah. Don't be shy, love. Come on. Hello. You know her. You're my big sister. How old are you? Eight. I have a daughter your age. Her name is Kira. I'm her cousin. Aunt, actually. But we're going to go with "cousin", for now. Come. Hmm. [Chuckle] "Our dog was the first dog to make the long journey west." So the puppy followed the explorer that whole way? Mm-hmm. Cool, huh? Can we read another? Mm-hmm. What you got? Whoa, "The Island of Dr. Moreau". It's about a man who makes monsters. I know. I love this book. It's special. Where did you get this book? Professor Duncan gave it to me for a present. Wow. [Laughing] So you're her monitor. I'm her mother. You carried her? Adopted her. [Chuckling] Like Siobhan. I'm invested. I thought they couldn't make any more of us. Oh, we tried. There were 400 attempts. Charlotte's the only survivor. But you survived, too, Sarah. Against all odds, you found your sisters and you fought for your own. Now, I'm counting on that fierce loyalty because what I'm about to share could put me at grave personal risk. You won't find topside in any company directory. We steer the DYAD group, with many other multinationals. You're a cabal. Yes. Securing monopolies on a future that embraces genetic engineering, synthetic biology, a future I passionately believe is inevitable. And, if you don't profit, someone else will. Yes, but it's not only about profit. There are other forces at work, beyond topside. I had evidence of another agenda, but I couldn't verify it without your mother's help. Please. Voice over radio: Five three six zero. Five three six zero. Sarah, the military never shut down Project LEDA. It was compartmentalized into two autonomous operations. While DYAD carried female clones to term, the military faction carried the males. This is Project Castor. I know him. Sarah will never forgive me. You did what you had to. ♪ Nearer my God ♪ And do you, Mark, promise to be faithful to Gracie? I do. Mark, you may kiss the bride. ♪ Nearer to thee ♪
