 Hey, it's Sarah. 
 I saw a girl kill herself. 
 Ew! 
 Yeah, and she looked exactly like me. 
 Elizabeth Childs? 
 I'm going to go up to her flat. 
 To find out who she is or to rob the rest of her sh1t? 
 Hello? 
 She's got $75,000 in a savings account. 
 Holy shite. 
 Beth is a cop. I'm a cop. 
 Katja: Your partner, he was following you. 
 If that was my boyfriend, I'd jump in front of a train, too. 
 What's happened? 
 A lot. 
 Something's different. How was the hearing? 
 Officer Elizabeth Childs, entering into record her version of the line-of-duty shooting... resulting in a civilian fatality... 
 Something's different. 
 I'm here for Kira, Fe. 
 You left Kira with Mrs. S... and you didn't come back for 10 months! 
 We have to have, like, a memorial sendoff. 
 [Crying] No no no, Kira's there. 
 She can't think I'm dead, Fe. 
 Beth, it's Katja. 
 Just one. I'm a few. 
 No family, too. Who am I? 
 [ Gunshot ] 
 [ Ringtone ] 
 Hello? 
 [ Tires screech ] 
 [U.S. accent] Beth, where have you been? 
 Uh, where have I been? 
 Um... 
 Uh, long story. 
 Well? 
 Well, what? 
 Did you meet the German? 
 I can't get a hold of her. 
 Beth? 
 What? The German's dead. Dead? Yeah, someone shot her, right in front of me! Oh, Jesus! Are you all right?! No! No, I'm not all right! She's in the back of my car! There's blood everywhere! Holy sh1t. Holy sh1t, it's true. What? That someone is killing us. They must've followed her from Europe. Jesus bloody Christ! What? Nothing. Nothing, nothing. Okay, okay, okay. Did you get the briefcase? Uh... Beth? What? You know what? Worry about that later. You need to get rid of the body. How? I... I... Like, how? I don't know. You're the cop. Like, buy a shovel. Just make sure you get her samples. Uh... samples? Hair and blood, Beth. You can do this. Uh... how about you come help me? I would if I could. Look, one step at a time. I'll call you back. Orphan Black 01x02 Instinct Origianl Air Date April 6, 2013 [ Soft music plays ] Sorry, Elizabeth Childs. Freaks and punks, lost puppies... We always had a friend in Sarah. You have a few words, Felix? Hmm? Mm. Anything you want to express? Oh, no, I... I can't, Bob. I'm too verklempt. "We're in bummed-out city... I plead your mercy and your pity is not life a mirror maze?" [ Cough ] To Sarah. To Sarah! [ Glasses clink ] Felix: To Sarah. I can't figure out why she killed herself. It's just not Sarah. It's not Sarah. Well, at least she had love. Whose love did she have, yours? Love [Sniff] is imperfect. Love is imperfection itself. If that's your definition, no wonder she jumped. sh1t! Hey! Whoa whoa, take it easy! Let him go, Vic! Say it! Go ahead, say it's my fault! Say it's my fault! It's... your... Vic! Vic! Be cool. Aaah! Everyone's raw. It's okay. All right. [Sniffle] I'm sorry. My bad. I'm not a huggy griever, Vic. Katja Obinger. Berlin. Who the hell are you? Eh. Oh, what time do you open? I need a front and driver's-side window. Vic, I'm tired. One last drink. A bourbon for Sarah. Oh. Oh, Jesus. Very good. Okay. Off you go. Wait a minute. My turn. God! I want to get to know Sarah's daughter. Out, Vic! Why not?! There's a reason you never met her. What is it? Well, let's see. For starters, you're a drug dealer. I could help her financially. And Sarah left you. She ran because you're abusive. I want to make up for that. All right, let's go. Let's go. Felix, I want to stay connected to her. To who? Who, Vic?! Her. Vic, Kira is not Sarah. Sarah's dead and she's not coming back. You need to man up and accept that. Felix? Hug me. Oh, come on. [ Door opens ] Vic! I have a knife and I will stab you in the face! sh1t. Aren't you supposed to wait, like, three days before rising? What the hell's this? That is your wake. It was agony. Yeah, Vic was here. Why'd you have one? Because I was mad at you, so I just decided to blow all the money from your stolen coke on it. [ Scoff ] Felix! Does Kira think I'm dead? I don't know. Oh, you don't know? Vic screwed everything up when he got hold of Mrs. S., somehow. I don't know what she told Kira. Vic. Yeah. Since you died, he's even more obsessed. He wants to meet Kira. No! No, I know that! Of course not. You think we'd let that happen? Hey, what's that? Right there. Well, it looks like... It looks like blood. Hey, whoa! What's going on? Nothing. Hey! Nothing. I don't want to talk about it. Sarah! [ Sigh ] You remember those birth certificates, yeah? Beth's and the two others? Yeah, Katja and Alison. Yeah? Yeah. Well, I met the German. What? Is she... another twin? Yeah. Leave it out, Felix.  Did she say who she was? Don't. What did she say?! I'm not getting into it. I can't... I seriously cannot explain it. All right, fine. Stop. Look, I need you to tell Mrs. S. I'm not dead, yeah? That it was all a mistake. No! No way. You do it. If I walk in there now, after 10 months, think about how hard she can make custody. What, so I go in and I say what? [ Sigh ] Lie? My God. Tell her it wasn't me. I don't care. Just make sure Kira knows that I'm fine. Yeah? We can still get out with her. That's my one bit of good news. Is this evil twin's money? Yeah, $75,000 in cash. That's enough to lose Vic, lose the twin- sister weirdness, just somewhere safe with my daughter. Is that so much to ask? Yeah, maybe. What? "Detective Arthur Bell". What?! b*st*rd must've followed me and nicked it. All right. All right, let's not go off, though, okay? No. Hey, let's... No, Sarah! Agh! Sarah! Sarah! Aah! b*st*rd! b*st*rd! Sarah! S... Whoa, hey, no! Not that. I'm working on that. Maggie Chen. Who the hell is Maggie Chen? Uh, it's the woman Beth shot. Right. So, now, what are these, all right? Official statement. Detective Arthur Bell, official statement. Detective Elizabeth Childs. What is this? This is... this is, like, the case. He left it for me. Her. If we want the money back from Art, I to have to be Beth again. Oh, for Christ's sake. How long can you keep gaming a cop? 'Til I get our money. It's 6:00 in the morning. You're going to call him now? Yeah, believe me... this call, he's waiting for. [ Ring ] [ Ring ] Took you a while. What the hell are you doing? Hey, I'm just following orders, Beth. Orders to steal from me? The lieutenant said "Take your rookie by the hand, walk her right through the hearing." Did you stop to check it before you crossed the border? Art, I'm at home! You got it all wrong. I never get it all wrong, do I? Well, it's not what you think. Meet me at Fung's at noon. Fung's? [ Dial tone ] What the hell's Fung's? Paul? Where were you last night? Aw, sh1t! Don't do that! I... I, uh... I was at the station, I was catching up on this backlog. You're under suspension. Yeah, so? They reconvened the hearing. I have to get on top of this stuff. First, you screw me wild for the first time in months, and then, you don't even call me to tell me that you're out all night? And why are you suddenly dressing like a punk-rock ho? Say again. No. You know what? Don't. I'm going to ignore that. I'm worried you're losing the plot again. We've been here before. No, Paul, we definitely haven't been here before. Sorry. I've got a lot of work to do. If you want, I can take it to the station, yeah? Beth, you're not ready for this. You need to take more time. Is that a diagnosis? Because I have plenty of professional help for that. Babe, please... Don't touch me. [Tearfully] You know, I can see this shooting is killing you, but you stopped talking to me months ago. Paul. What am I supposed to do? It's my problem. You don't have to take this on. Well, I have. And I can't keep waking up every night, checking your breathing, worried you're mixing your meds, booze, God knows what else, so... I'm going back to Cody's for a while. Okay. Yeah, if that's what you want. "Punk-rock ho"? Oh. Hi, monkey. Did you see my mum? Oh. Um, sweetie... Oi-oi, Mrs. S. [Irish accent] Go on upstairs, Kira, love. Uncle Felix has got some explaining to do. I knew it was too good to be true. Sarah's too tough to commit suicide. Most feral mutt I ever took in. Don't shrug. Staging a funeral to get away from Vic. Why would you help with such a  stupid  plan? Vic's a dick. Plagued, that girl was, from the very start. What do you mean by that? Tell her that she hasn't seen her daughter in almost a year and I think it's best if it stays like that. Why don't you tell her yourself, Siobhan? I'm not going to play Felix in the middle. Oh, no? You're here at her beck and call, aren't you? Yes, I am! To make sure that Kira doesn't think that her mother's dead. And, oh, good, look... she doesn't. You and Sarah, you can work out the rest. Years of my life. Leaving London, all my people there, to bring the two of you here for a fresh start. I'd do it all again, Felix. Every visit from the bloody police, every missing- persons report, every punch we threw, because Kira is a gift. Sarah knows that. No, she hasn't a clue. She is trying. Badly, granted, but in her own way, she is, she's really trying. [ floor creaks ] [Laughing] Ohh. Caught ya. C'mere. C'mere, monkey. [ Sniffle ] When is mummy coming? You know when, love. When she's ready? And? When you say she's ready? Sounds fair to me. Right here is where I thought I saw Yip. That's when I drew my weapon. She... What'd she do? It's not a payoff, Art, it's not. Then cut the sh1t, Beth, and tell me where it came from. It's Paul's, okay? It's Paul's and mine. I cleaned out our joint savings account. I haven't told him yet. Yeah, I was going to leave town, but I couldn't do it, okay? I turned around. For Paul. To clear the shooting, Art. I'm not dirty, I just freaked out. Are you wearing a wire? No! You never saw the vic before? No previous contact with Margaret Chen? No! If there is another version of the story, if that money is somehow connected. There's only one story, Art. Then walk me through it again, so I know you won't crack under questioning. I was by myself, I was canvassing witnesses on another case. Which case? The Ramsay thing. Sun Jewelry heist. The Ramsay thing. Sun Jewelry heist. I wasn't even looking for Yip. Yip who? Xan Yip, U.S. racketeering warrant. I'd seen her sheet that morning... Asian female, 41. And? And... Right here... Is where I thought I saw Yip. You thought? I did. I saw her. I called her name, I told her to freeze. She didn't. She ran. Disappeared down... You're making me nervous. Good. Now, you know how it feels. When did you draw your weapon? I drew when I entered the courtyard, here. That's when I drew my weapon. And then she disappeared down there. I crossed to there. And that's when I heard somebody behind me and I turned around... Poogh! And I fired twice. They were both wearing black. It wasn't her. It wasn't her. Then what? Then I saw the phone in her hand and I called it in. And then you showed up. If they find out you called me before you called it in, Beth, they're going to start to dig. And if they dig, they find the pills and, if they find the pills, you may crack under questioning and tell them that I put the phone in the vic's hand to cover your tweaker ass. I wouldn't do that, Art. I got to carry what I did. Maggie Chen was in the wrong place at the wrong time. That's it. None of this ends up on you. Good. But, to be sure, I'm going to hang on to that money until you're cleared. 
 
 How's that? Kira's fine. You're not dead to your daughter. C'mere. [ Sob ] I know. I know. She knows I'm back, doesn't she? I can feel her. She knows. She's been asking for you. She knows. I know. Okay. What about Mrs. S.? Don't worry about that now, okay? We'll work it out later. Thank you. Just take us with you when you leave again. I promise, I promise, I promise. All right. Do you want a cuppa? Yeah. So Art won't give me the money until I clear Beth's shooting. What do you mean, like, go back in front of a police board, with, like, lawyers and cross-examination, and stuff? Yeah. [ Ringtone ] That's the least of my worries. [ Ring ] That's Beth's other phone. [ Ring ] Is that the German? It's definitely not the German. All right, I think it's time that you told me what's actually going on. Beth was investigating her twins, too. I think whatever she found out drove her nuts and she topped herself. What? So do I pick up? No! No! I can't help myself. Then why even ask? Shh. Hello, uh, this is, um, this is Beth. [U.S. accent] Finally! Where have you been? Busy, obviously. Right. Did you get the German's briefcase? No. Why? Because I told you to. Where is she staying, Beth? Hello. One sec! Okay. Uh, Carlsborough Hotel, room 303. Well, go, get the briefcase before they do. I'll call back at midnight. [Beep] What's in... What's in the briefcase? Who is that? Every time I think I know something, I'm wrong. Whoa, hold on. Beth, Katja, and Alison Hendrix. Is it her? I don't know, Felix. Well, what happened to the German? Are you seriously going there? Don't you want to know what's in the briefcase? No! Cash? It's still a hustle, Fe. Can I borrow this? No. Yeah. I don't know. Mmm. [German accent]  Guten morgen. Katja Obinger. [Chuckle] Sarah. Don't worry. You actually look kind of hot. It's good, innit? [ Practicing German ] [ German "These Boots Are Made For Walking" plays ] Nein, nein. Miss Obinger. Miss Obinger? Miss Obinger! Miss Obinger! Was that her? Yeah. [ Chime ] ♪ Yeah [ ring ] sh1t. [ Ring ] [ Ring ] [ Ring ] [ Ring ] [ Ring ] [ Ring ] [ Pounding on door ] [ Ring ] sh1t. [ Pounding ] Ahem.  Ja. Hello. Avery, from the front desk. Could we talk with you downstairs, please? [ Sigh ] Why would you go in my room? We had a noise complaint, which led to a security check. Ma'am, your room was trashed. Rock-n-roll. "Rock-n-roll"? The sink is broken. What the heck is wrong with you? Unfortunately, we have an itemized bill. Sink, mirror, three pillows. $6,000? $6,437.11, yes. Ja. So? You have my card on file,  ja? Yes. And my briefcase. One moment. Authorizing. Must've been a heck of a party. Everything appears to be in order. I'm very sorry about this. Ahem! Are you enjoying the city? It's killing me. Danke schoen. Danielle Fournier. Katja. Austrian. Italian? Danielle Fournier, France. Alison Hendrix, Scarborough. You're practically local. [ Ringtone ] And punctual. [ Ring ] Hello? Hey. Did you get to the hotel? Yeah, but somebody got there first. They ransacked her room. sh1t! No briefcase? I didn't say that. Did you find it, or not? Hang on. Screw it. [As herself] Hello? Who am I speaking to? Beth? Alison? Who is this? Who is this?! Beth's indisposed. Is this Alison? Just one. I'm a few. No family, too. Who am I? Yeah, sorry, riddler, means nothing to me. Look, Beth said to say I have the briefcase. Do you want me to bring it to you? [ Click, dial tone ] "35 Black Oak Drive". Stop it! You  stop it! You  stop it! Hey hey hey! No no no no. Don't hurt her. Holy shite. A soccer mom. Follow your sister. Don't run. Good boy! Good boy. [ Blows whistle ] There you go. [ Ringtone ] Child: Over there! Hello? Oh. Go. Go, go! Vivien! I'm going to cut the... yeah. [ Gasp ] I just want some answers. Are you out of your mind? How dare you show your face in front of my children. How did you find me? The German had your address. I've got what you wanted. I've got her briefcase. [ Scoff ] Idiot. Do you even know who you're talking to? Hmm? Where is Beth? Uh, she's dead. What? I'm sorry. She killed herself. No. No, no, she wouldn't do that. That's impossible. No, I'm sorry. I saw her do it. No, that can't be. Mnh-mnh. Look, I can explain, okay? My name's Sarah... I don't care who you are. Why, Lord? Why me? I never wanted any part of this. Do I wear a huge "kick me" sign on my back? Please, just tell me... Who are we to each other? Are you kidding me? I'm not doing that. Nope, that is not my responsibility... You know, you need to get out of here. Go and wait for a call. Eh, tell me what the hell... Let go! Don't touch me. This is my neighborhood. You wait for a call. Oh, and hide your ugly face on the way out of here. Bitch. Okay, oranges, guys! Can I take two? Yeah, you take two. [ Ring ] [ Ring ] [ Sigh ] [ Ring ] What's up, Art? Where are you? I'm at home in the tub with a bourbon. Can you hear me knocking? [ Pounds on door ] No? Because you're not home. Okay, I'm in Scarborough. What? Why?! I had to go to Bed Bath & Beyond, okay? Nobody wants to admit that. Look, whatever, Beth. What the hell did you say to the shrink? She's ruling you unfit for duty. What? Why? Yeah, unfit means no hearing tomorrow. Oh, sh1t! It means this crap goes on and on and guess what... I'm keeping your money until it ends. I'll go see her now. No no no, it's too late for that, Beth. Get me another appointment, okay? Tell her it's an emergency, you're worried about me. She's my doctor. She has to see me. And what are you going to say to her to change her mind? I'll figure something out. Bowers: I'm sorry. My opinion is you're not ready for duty. I am, though. I'm making progress, full progress. Go on. You know, with the guilt, seeing cell phone and reacting "gun". You're just parroting our last meeting back to me. No, I'm admitting my mistake, Dr. Bowers, I'm acknowledging it, like you said. Honestly, the best thing for me now is to get back to work. Last time I saw you, you couldn't remember the shooting. "I'm missing myself. I glitched. A break, or something." I remember it just fine. What I'm trying to do is move on. Sorry, Beth, but, considering your mental state, leading up to the incident... That's behind me now, Dr. Bowers. And by your own admission of blackout or psychotic break, I can't recommend you for duty. [ Sigh ] That's not going to work for me. I understand, you're a cop, but this is my job. Can you read that back again? That, um, "I'm missing myself. I glitched." Does that sound stoned to you? "Glitched" sounds stoned? Tweaked, gakked, spun. Ahem! Allevia, superprax, draxifil. What's the difference between a mood stabilizer and an antipsychotic, again? Beth... Oh, no, I'm sorry, I've been confused. I mean, it's very confusing. Um... Antidepressants, antianxieties, SSRIs. Serotronax... That one's a stimulant. We have known each other for a while, now, Beth... Yeah? That's where you're wrong. You have constantly tested me with your personal appeals for prescriptions. I know. My bad. So I'll just explain to the board that I shot this poor civilian after mixing up all your overlapping scrips. Or am I making progress? All right, if everybody here, let's see if we could do this again. The board convenes in a fatal line-of-duty shooting, October 7th of this year. State your name and rank for the record and begin. Detective Elizabeth Childs. You did well. We'll have a ruling in a couple of days. Okay. [ Ringtone ] [ Ring ] This is Sarah. Alison: Well, Sarah, this will be quick. Good. Since you apparently already know where I live and I can't find a sitter, come by after 9:00 tonight. How about right now? Tonight! Bring whatever you got from the German. Go around back and go to the basement door. Knock quietly! Not bad, Childs. Not bad. I nailed it, man, every detail. Yeah. They haven't ruled yet. Please contain your excitement. This is me, excited. Come on, Art, give me a little love, here, yeah? Why do you have to be such a hardass? Because it's your favorite thing about me. [ Chuckle ] [ Siren wails ] Look, Paul doesn't know I took that money out of our account. So just let me put it back before he finds out, yeah? I hang on to it 'til you're reinstated. That's the deal. [Scoff] There was no deal, it was just you, taking... Looking out for  you,  partner. Oh, my God! Ugh! You know I never would've got in if you said we were going to suburbia. Oi, what are you doing? Don't stop. Someone might speak to us. God! Christ. You know, my skin just breaks out every time I leave the downtown. Yeah, yeah. Right there. Look... acne. No, I don't see acne. Am I blushing? There's redness! Right there! Tiny, little suburban stress zits, emerging in direct proximity to bad architecture. Look, Fe, I'm going to have the money in a couple days. Okay? And then... Look, I'll make good with Mrs. S. and we'll take Kira somewhere quiet, yeah? Somewhere warm. Yeah, please. So what's in the house? I won't be long. Oh, my God! Who's in there? Stay here, okay? Is it the German? [ Sigh ] The German's dead. She's dead?! She died?! Sadly, yes. This one's an uptight [as Beth] Soccer mom. Hey, Sarah! You always do this to me! I just need you to be my backup, okay? I don't do backup! I don't even know what backup is! Give me half an hour. What am I supposed to do 'til then? Nothing. I just need somebody to know where I am. Wait, that is not comforting! Sarah! Sh...! Close it, lock it. Really? Be quiet. My kids are sleeping. You're going to shoot me while your kids are sleeping? You wake them or show your face, yes, I will shoot you. Well I've never known a blood relation, but being your twin certainly sucks. You really have no idea, do you? [U. S. Accent] Hey. I'm Cosima. Bloody hell. We talked on the phone. How many of us are there? We're clones. We're soneone's experiment and they're killing us off! Is that helpful? Oh, my God! What are you doing in my yard? You want answers, I want the briefcase. Seriously, life or death. What kind of mother am I if I snatch my own daughter? You're reinstated. Oh, sh1t! Yes, I'm at the bloody crime scene, pretending to be a bloody cop, so I need to know if the bloody fingerprints will flag a bloody match. Freeze! Police! Beth! [ Gasp ]
