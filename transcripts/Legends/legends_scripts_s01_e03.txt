 Previously on Legends... 
 McCombs :  There is no Martin Odum. He's a legend. 
 Who am I?! 
 Rice :  You know, the LAPD... they found a couple  more witnesses. Why didn't you tell me you were there? 
 Martin :  I didn't kill him. 
 Rice :  Who did? 
 What do they want? 
 I used to be a chemist  for the Russian military. 
 Richard Hubbard was actively involved in Russia's chemical weapons program. 
 Maggie :  The burglary happened last night. 
 Those are the chemicals used to produce VX gas. Crystal :  There's only two motives here. They're gonna make VX to sell. They're gonna make VX to use. Oh. I won't do it! But I think you will, Alexander. Colonel. Are you going under again? This is gonna kill you. Sonya... Who's the legend? Gates :  Dante Auerbach, Lord of War. (panting) (groaning) Help me! Help me! I got you. Come on. (gasps) (loud thudding) Jane? Susan? It's me. Dad! Come on. Come on. Come on, we have to go. Now. Grab my hand. Let's go. Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! (whimpering) I'm right behind you. Get over the fence. Come on, Jane, help me do this... Go, go, go. Go. Help me. (women whimpering) Okay. Get on your knees. (screams) No... Susan, Susan, are you okay? Are you okay? If you run again, your family dies. (screams) Yes, Martin Odum is our best asset, no question, when he's healthy. I read the psych report, too. I'm concerned about putting him under again so quickly at such high stakes. We have no choice. Clock is ticking, people. They're not gonna hold Hubbard and his family any longer than they have to. At a maximum, figure three days to make the VX. Which means three days until there's a weapons grade nerve agent on American soil. The amount of chemicals stolen from that warehouse can be used to manufacture enough VX to kill thousands. So, how is Martin gonna be able to find the VX in time, let alone the Hubbards? His legend... Dante Auerbach. He's got more contacts in the weapons black market than anybody. What do we know about this guy he's meeting? He goes by Khalid. Real name is Ahmed Abdul. He's a facilitator. He makes introductions. Crystal :  So Dante thinks Khalid will lead us to the VX supplier. Hopefully, Hubbard's captors. All of that in three days. I'll just be curled up in the corner over here. It's Dante's show now. Let's see what he does. Good day, sir. I find a scratch, I'm taking a finger. Fair warning. Incentive. Bang. You're dead. Mr. Auerbach. Oh. Khalid. How are you? That's one way to say hello. Martin :  Long time. Then, they showed up with the ammunition in boxes with Chinese markings after we'd warned them... I thought you were going to shoot the bastards right there. I was that close. That really happened? I highly doubt it. He's good. Totally sold that. He doesn't win the Academy Award until he gets a solid lead. I heard rumors you got pinched. I was running proxy contracts for the Pentagon, arming the Afghan rebels through some contacts in Peshawar. Some material leaked? I was on the hook for selling arms to groups hostile to the United States. These people in Washington... such hypocrites. I do their bidding until the D.O.D. gets caught with their hands in the cookie jar, wants someone to blame. Play with fire. Should have known. So what now? You coming back? Martin : What else am I gonna do? But no more gray market stuff. I got to do something... I don't know... do something bigger. You get pinched dealing WMD, and they'll throw away the key, huh? I'm not gonna make a career of it. Get in, get out, walk away with eight figures. That's a risky game, my friend. I'm always looking over my shoulder, no matter what kind of weight I'm moving. Might as well shoot for the moon. You have a buyer? I've got a few associates from the shock-and-awe days. I've heard the Chechens have product available. But I don't have any connect. I was hoping you might be able to help me. He's not gonna bite. There might be someone in town. A Greek. Could be worth a shot. Searching all entry visas for the last 30 days. Greek passports and birthplaces. Cross-reference those names with Interpol's criminal database. Khalid : But as a friend, I'd rather do time than do business with Paulanos. Paulanos. Tough negotiator. Maybe the toughest. Particularly for you. (laughs) Why me? I've known you a long time, Dante. You have certain weaknesses that Paulanos may be suited to exploit. Risk and reward go hand in hand. Can you set something up? Not getting any hits. Definitely an alias. (chuckles) Martin :  Reservation under Khalid, please. The other party has arrived. In the back. Thank you. Thank you. You're welcome. Excuse me. I'm looking for Mr. Paulanos. I'm Paulanos. Ana Paulanos. What a lovely mistake. Where's Khalid? Unfortunately, something came up. He, uh... he sends his regrets. And who are you? I'm a friend of his. A good friend. I'm afraid I'm too busy for friends of friends, Mister... Auerbach. Dante. If you'll excuse me. Don't run off. You don't know what you're missing. Honestly, Mr. Auerbach, I don't care. It's no wonder people don't take you seriously. Excuse me? Just because you're beautiful, you think every man wants to sleep with you. I find it very unprofessional. Did you think this was a date? Please. I have all I can handle on that front. The guy is good. He's not that good. He's really good. He's keeping Ana around while I run the Stingray that he just planted under the table, which allowed me to trick every cell in the bar to broadcast to us instead of the local tower. So, in another 15 seconds, I'll have isolated her cell, then we have her calls, contacts, texts, the works. You're  good. Martin : Khalid thought we might like to meet to do some business together. What line of work are you in? I'm in the wine business. Please... sit. What are you in the mood for? Red or white? I don't have a preference. Good. I already ordered an excellent Chardonnay. What do you do in the wine trade, Mr. Auerbach? I suppose you could call me a private sommelier. I have a select list of clients with very sophisticated palates. I buy wine for them. That's why I wanted to meet you. I have one client in particular who's interested in rare vintages. (laughs) Go to Napa. They don't want something that can be bought in Napa. They want something no one else has. Something exceptional. These are people of extreme means. Committed collectors. What size lot? Large lots. Exclusively. It's got a nice finish. Where are we? What is this place? (groans) (groans) You should be grateful. You have it much nicer than I did in Yavas. The Corrective Colony. Eight years I spent there in a cell a fraction of the size of this room. Because of you. You betrayed me... and our country. When you sold the weapons to God only knows who. Don't act like you didn't know things were going on, Doctor. You took payments. Where did you think the money was coming from? I came to believe that what we were doing... what I was doing... was wrong. I realized early in my life that belief is subjective, fallible, the road to folly. No. My belief... ...is not to believe. Instead, one should act in one's best interest. Do you know your own best interests, Alexander? Your family's? You're going to make  the VX gas for me, or you and your family will die. Martin :  Just left Paulanos at the restaurant. She knew I was talking about black market weapons, Maggie : Incoming call on Paulanos' cell. We need a warrant, technically. Get Gates up here. We have to run this down, Crystal. Don't have a lot of time. Backdate it. FISA rubber-stamps everything anyway. Paulanos : Where is it, Alain? Alain : Be patient. Uh, the clients had some unexpected complications. Maggie : This guy's got to be the buyer. That is their issue. We had an agreement. The transfers must be untraceable, you understand that? You assured me these were legitimate buyers. The money is coming. I promise. Paulanos : You have until 8:00 a.m. tomorrow. Alain : I'm moving on it. Paulanos is selling something. Yeah, it's VX. Maggie : We haven't confirmed that. But I've got her cell. I'm running down the contacts. I say we let it play out. What if we let it play out and we lose Ana? One VX canister has enough nerve gas in it to kill everyone in this building ten times over. Crystal's right. We got to keep operational control, in case. Martin : Yeah, we need to get this Frenchman... the broker... get him out of the picture. Then I step into the deal with a straw buyer. Maggie, any ping on the caller? Yes. I geolocated his cell. He is downtown at the Vondrian Hotel. Let's get eyes on him. On my way. (knocking) Room service. One second. (unlocking) (grunting) (door locks) What are you doing? You will be killed for this. Yeah? Get up. "Delicates." But no Frenchman setting. (sizzling) This is not gonna stop until you answer my questions. Lying won't help you. I'll know. What are you buying from Paulanos? They'll kill me. Do you know there are more nerve endings in the lower back than in the genitals? Please. Please, don't. No. Please, no. Don't. Is it VX? Huh? No. No. (screams) Okay. Okay. Okay, it's VX. Who are you buying it for? I don't know. There's a proxy. And who is the proxy? Maduro. PSUV. They're worrying about the civil unrest in Venezuela. (phone beeps) (line ringing) Here. Tell her you're out. Tell her not to contact you again. What is it, Alain? Alain : I'm sorry, I'm-I'm afraid I'm going to have to back out. What? Yes, I-I'm afraid it's final. This is the last time we will speak. Do not try to contact me again. Any attempt to resuscitate this deal will result in your termination. We have eyes on you every minute of every day. Do you understand? Oui. That's good. (chuckles) I'm gonna tell you something... you guys got it good up here in the DCO. Not like that crap we got downstairs in Transpo Security. Laptops are from the '80s. Let me tell you, if I had all the... The point, Agent Rice. Like to talk to one of your agents. Martin Odum. Why? Odum came to see me and asked me about a homicide. Schizo drifter named Robert McCombs. Struck me as odd as to why he was so curious. Then, days later, a witness turns up, shows me this. This is the crime scene. The vic is in the green jacket. That's him, right? That's Odum? Hard to tell. Not really. And I thought it was kind of suspicious that Odum never told me he was on that subway platform. So I'd like to talk to Mr. Odum and see why he misrepresented his involvement. He's unavailable. Yeah, where is he? For how long? You don't have clearance to know. This a... murder case the DCO's working on? I'm not at liberty to say. I get it. Well, when Mr. Odum becomes available... ...let him know I'd like to talk to him. He'll know where to find me. I know this is a big case. See, I got video of Odum kneeling over the victim as the crime occurred. I got Odum lying to me about being there in the first place. And I got his boss in the DCO being tight-lipped and denying interest in the case. You were supposed to take this case to OPR... This is what I think, okay? I think that we got some rogue deep-cover operative who-who topped some skell. Right? And now he's being protected by his boss in this huge cover-up; that's what I think. Yeah, well, you think a whole lot of things. Yeah, you know what else? Agents don't do murders in my FBI. I'm not dropping this case. You can't arrest an FBI agent without a smoking gun there, Fife. Okay, enough, enough with the smoking gun. You know me, okay? You know me. And you know what? I'm gonna get you your evidence. Good luck. See? See what you said? It's a big case. So tell me something... what's it like overseeing an agent with my instincts, huh? It's like a dream, isn't it? Makes your job easier. Good-bye, Rice. I love you, too. Nightmare. What did you do to the broker? Do we need to pull you out? I'm not blown. The frog is out of the picture. No. He's not dead. Paulanos will move quickly to find another buyer. Possibly domestic, for a domestic attack. I could reach out to her. If you have another go at her, she'll spook. She doesn't want to hold on to the VX any longer than she has to. You reach out to Ana again, there will be no deal. She'll vanish. She has to come to you. In the meantime, we'll keep tabs on her. Gates thinks you're up for this. Hope he's right. Gates :  Martin,  you wouldn't be the first undercover agent to struggle coming out of a case. Confusion of identity, personality dissociation, fugue states... these are recognized risks for deep-cover operatives, Martin. Hey. I'm sorry for coming around unannounced. There's a fine line between spontaneous and stalking, Martin. Boundaries. I know, I just need to talk to you. You don't look good, Martin. Are you okay? Just need to ask you some questions. I don't have anyone else to talk to. Please, Sonya. I-I think something's happening to me. I don't know if I'm this guy or that guy, or if this guy's me. I know it sounds crazy, but... I-I just need you to tell me... how I proposed. It was on a beach, was it? I-I remember there... there was a beach. Yeah? You really don't remember? It was Easter, your parents' backyard. Look, Aiden's gonna be out any moment. I don't want him seeing you like this. Us like this. He's taking this whole thing really hard. This is just gonna upset him. 
 
 Dad! Hey. (laughs) Hey, bud. How was school, huh? Horrible, of course. We're still on for this weekend, right? I'm staying with you? Uh, we've got a problem, pal. Some... Something's come up at work, and, uh... I know. ...I don't think... It's all right. Don't worry. I'll make it up to you. That's why I came around today. To see you. Come on, let's go. You're gonna be late. (phone ringing) I was hoping you'd call. I've come across a very distinctive vintage. I thought your clients might be interested. Depends on the vintage. Meet me at the 77 Grand tonight. 8:00. (line ringing) Gates : Yeah? Got the call from Paulanos. On for tonight. I'll brief the crew. One more thing: an agent from downstairs came to see me about you. Agent Rice? He'd be the one. Feel free to get him off my ass before he blows my cover. I'll do what I can. But when this is over, we're gonna have a little sit-down. (knocking) Yuri : Why did the Frenchman back out? Paulanos : Alain got cold feet, buyer didn't materialize. I don't know. But he's out. I can chase him. Don't be an idiot. If he comes back to us, it's with a wire. I warned you this might happen. Yes. Yuri : And it played out exactly as I said. Maggie : I'm plugging the audio into a word cloud program that pings key words. Paulanos : I know. I want to make it right. I have other options I'm looking into. Colonel, I know you're disappointed. She said "Colonel." It must be the same guy that Dimitri mentioned. Yuri : After everything I've done for you, I expect more. I pulled you out of an orphanage in Samashki. Samashki's in Chechnya. I'm seeing if we have audio for a voice match. Great. Do you know what would have happened to you if I hadn't done that, what your life would have been? I saved you. The longer we hold the product, the greater the risk. Ultimately, I won't be the one bearing it. If you can't get this done, then I'll start over. With a clean slate. I'm sorry. I know you are. I know. (computer beeps) We've got our colonel. Call Martin, fill him in; I'll brief Gates. (squeaking) (frantic squeaking) Yuri : It's not difficult if you're properly motivated. It's just the first step. With this equipment, I can only make small batches. You know how this works. I also know how you like to stall, Alexander. The process is what it is. I'm gonna need another 24 hours, at least. You can go without sleeping. 'Cause if you don't finish in 18 hours, you and your family are up against the wall. I'll kill your daughter first. Yuri Medved. He was a Chechen resistance colonel in the First Chechen War in 1994. He flipped allegiance halfway through and sided with the Russians. After the war ended, he was brought to trial for murder. Specifically for the rape and killing of a 24-year-old woman he claimed was a sniper for the enemy. Medved served eight years in an army prison, then he bought his way out. In the '90s, he was rumored to be the source of some black market nerve agents out of Crimea, manufactured by none other than Alexander Nevelsky. Gates : That's our kidnapped scientist. With WMD in play, we need to coordinate with the WMD Directorate, Critical Incident, brief the joint task force. We need an agency-wide response. Understood, but we should be careful about how visible our approach is. We're at a very fragile stage in our undercover operation. Who's under now? Well, our agent has inserted himself as a broker of the deal involving the VX gas. Now, if all goes as planned, we'll be able to recover the weapon and bring down the organization behind it. Who's the agent? Martin Odum, sir. Odum? Under again so soon? He's been in legend a week, and he's already penetrated the network. What about you, Ms. McGuire? What do you think about Odum? He put us on a hot lead very quickly, no question. But? But his approach is unorthodox. The ends justify the means, and that puts us... Our operation ends with the interdiction of WMD. Odum is the only agent I trust with a case of this magnitude; I am comfortable with his tactics. Give us a week before you start knocking down doors. That's all I'm asking. You have 24 hours. Get it done. Hungover at gunpoint is not ideal, okay? But there I am, in a hangar off the tarmac, and these PLA goons force me to open the cargo hold, which is full of surface-to-air missiles. I have a warrant for my arrest out from Beijing, and I get the one captain in the million-man army that won't take a bribe. So what did you do? I explained the missiles were cloud seeders, not munitions at all, part of an international research program to reduce smog. And they bought it. (laughs) Completely. They were all trained in Xingtai. The air quality there is horrendous. They all had black lung. They actually thanked me before letting me go. (both laughing) Romance at short notice is my specialty. Uh-huh. (chuckles) I'm learning more about you by the moment. I wonder what other secrets you're hiding. Tell me more about your clients. Known them for years. Great integrity. Paulanos :  Mm-hmm. Martin :  Once a deal is struck, the deal is done. Are they... domestic? Isn't it simpler if we're all anonymous? Paulanos :  Actually, I'm very glad to hear you say that. Tell me about this vintage of yours. (quietly): It's a V-series nerve agent. An area denial weapon. This particular lot is patterned off a Russian process from the 1990s. Go on. The VX has high persistence in the environment. It's tasteless, odorless. It can be distributed as a spray, liquid, aerosol... I think my clients would be very interested, actually. Paulanos :  That's enough about business. I want to know more about you. About Dante. Martin :  Well, there's nothing more to add that you probably don't already know. Or won't find out soon enough. I don't know everything. Are you married? I was. I'm separated right now. Oh. That's too bad. You're a closet romantic. (chuckles) I bet you proposed in some... elaborate way. Yes. On a beach, actually. At sunset. (chuckles) Very, uh... very elaborate. Why did it end? I didn't pay as much attention to my marriage as I should have. She deserved better. If you had it to do again, what would you do differently? I don't know that I could do anything differently. I am who I am, for better or worse. But that doesn't alleviate the guilt, does it? Let's go. Where are we going? To consummate the deal. (elevator bell dings) ♪ ♪ Do you always sleep with your business partners? It's part of the vetting process. (door opens) Evening, Agent Rice. Nisco : I'll leave you boys to talk. House calls are below your pay grade, ain't they, Gates? Not when you're tailing one of my agents during an extremely sensitive operation. I'm not trying to step on anybody's toes. See, Martin Odum is a material witness to a brutal homicide in which he lied to an investigating agent. I have a duty to follow that case wherever it goes. Well, the case he's working on now is a hell of a lot more important. Literally thousands of lives could be at stake. Back off. I'm not gonna back off until I know why Odum was on that subway platform. You know, I think you're a little unsure yourself. That's why you're here. You got five reprimands, one for use of excessive force. Seems to me you tend to overdo things, which is probably why you haven't been promoted. You writing a book? Tack on obstruction of a federal investigation charge to your résumé, and then your job prospects turn into, well... what job? Daddy, I can't sleep. Go back upstairs, sweetie. I'll be up in a second, okay? Okay. Nice family. Don't make me an enemy. (phone buzzing) There's someone I'd like you to meet tonight. Good. What do we have? Martin's in. Paulanos wants him to meet the supplier. I'll pick you up at 7:00. Okay. I really enjoyed last night. Yeah, me, too. Hmm. (chuckles) Gates :  Martin can't risk being exposed as an undercover operative, not with the VX still out there. That means no wire, no follow team. Cell phone, gun. Give me everything. Put it on. Gates :  We'll track the transport vehicle via satellite, but he'll be on his own. Maggie : I have a lock on Martin. (computer beeps) He's leaving downtown,  heading east towards Echo Park. I just pinned a number that Paulanos dialed three times on the day of Hubbard's kidnapping. It's the opposite direction from where Martin's headed, but it looks like a warehouse. Isolated, secure. Guarantee that's our lab. Yeah, they could be holding the Hubbard family there. We've got about ten hours before Spiller takes this over. Let's get a tac team down there now. Maggie, set up mobile command. What, are we driving in circles? I don't have anyone following me. Crystal : Alpha team, what do you have for us? I've got three bogeys outside the warehouse, armed and hot. Defensive posture. They're definitely guarding something. You seeing this? The hot spot is registering at over 300 degrees. VX gas requires sustained high temperatures. That's the lab where they're making the nerve gas. That means Hubbard's there. Maybe his family, too. Jam the nearby cell towers. I want an eight-block radius to go dark to all wireless traffic, you understand? I don't want the Chechens tipping anyone that we hit them, then have that boomerang onto Martin. I'll put the warehouse in a black hole. Gates : Crystal, let's go. Crystal : Alpha team approaching standby position. Maggie : All wireless jammed. Gates : Engage hostiles. Shoot to kill. (silenced gunfire, grunting) Crystal : Keep the masks and gloves on until you're clear of the building. If you're exposed to the nerve agent, inject the atropine right away. Move in. Move in. Man : Go! Go! Go! Go! Watch your six. (rapid gunfire) Man : Bogeys down. Moving into the east corridor. East corridor. Looks clear. Check the corner. (gunfire) Aah! Man : Nail that guy. Nice shot, McGuire. Mitch, find the Hubbards. We're going for the lab. Copy that. Maggie : Crystal, that hot spot should be dead ahead. Got it. Bravo's moving east. Approaching hot spot. Command, we found the lab. Gates : Crystal, check around. Any sign of the VX? Stand by. We're checking. I'll cover you. Go. (yelling) (gasps) Richard Hubbard? Maggie, Hubbard says his wife and daughter are locked in the west corridor. Alpha team leader, do you copy? Copy that. We're in the west corridor. Bogey, one o'clock. Clear! You're okay now. We're gonna get you out of here. We've got the mother and daughter; extracting them now. Where's my husband? Is Richard okay? Stand down. Building's clear. Command, this is Alpha team leader. We've been all over this place; there is no VX here. I repeat, there is no sign of the VX. Susan! Jane! Dad! Oh. (sobbing) Richard : I'm so sorry. They must have already moved the VX. (gunfire) (people shouting) I guess it's up to Martin now. Take it off. It's interesting timing, you coming out of the woodwork right when my recent buyer vanished. I didn't know you had another buyer. I'm, uh... I'm Dante, by the way. Ana tells me you spent time in federal prison. Yes. So? Well, it's a common practice of the FBI to turn prisoners in exchange for reduced prison sentences. What is this? I didn't come here for an inquisition. Other than Khalid, who knows you? Who knows  you? How do I know you don't have some side deal with Immigration to look away at a few checkpoints, give them a limey broker in exchange? Huh. Hey, look, I'm not wired. I've nothing to hide. What about you? What have you got? (grunts) Go ahead, shoot. I'll splatter your boss all over the walls. You don't trust me, kill me. We'll both die together. Or we can sit down, make each other some money. My buyers are prepared to wire ten percent of the purchase price as soon as I leave this building. But they require some proof that you've got the goods. Very well. (muffled groaning, panting) A single drop on the skin is enough to kill. You should try the product before you buy. (muffled groaning) Who is he? Not your concern. What did he do to you? He disappointed me. Please don't shed a tear. Want you to do the honors. And then what? I do the business, and he lives? I'm guessing not. Because no VX, no deal. And that's pretty sh1t for us both, isn't it? You wouldn't go to the trouble if you knew your product wasn't gonna work. I know it will work, yes, but I'm not trying to prove this to you, Mr. Auerbach. I want you to prove something to me. I'm a businessman, not a killer. Do your own dirty work. I insist. (scoffs) (muffled groaning) But on his skin, it's too slow. Put it in the eye. (muffled groaning continues) Open his eye. (muffled screaming) Now we have trust.
