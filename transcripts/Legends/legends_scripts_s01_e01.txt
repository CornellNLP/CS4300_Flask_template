 A very sophisticated explosive device... 
 A group calling itself the Citizens' Army of Virginia... 
 ...if you can imagine this, were larger... 
 ...known only as the Founding Father. 
 They were trying to move people out of the way... 
 ...has claimed responsibility for the bombing... 
 ...did go off. It did the damage... 
 ...which has so far taken the lives of 57 people. (gunfire, indistinct chatter) Man : Dittmann, hold your fire. Streeter wants to see you. Me? You. Now. (knocking) (door opens) Man : I got Lincoln Dittmann here, boss. (chuckles) What's the matter? You all look like your d-dog died or something. Some kind of problem? Russell here thinks so. He says you've been talking trash about the Citizens' Army of Virginia. (laughs) Oh, you think that's funny? Come on, Russell. All I said was I'm tired of shooting p-p-paper targets. I came here 'cause I heard you were the ones who blew up that federal building in Wichita, but all I've seen so far is a bunch of wannabes who don't want to do anything real. The Founding Father's gonna change all that. The F-F-Founding Father? That's right. He's ready to start a fire that's gonna burn down the so-called government. Well... (chuckles) all I can say is, what took him so long? (chuckles) I mean, that's all I've been waiting for since I got here, the chance to blow some sh1t up. I'm in. You just tell me what you need me to do. I'll do it. Anything, okay? Anything. (gun cocks) Even die? Talk is talk, and you sure talk a lot. But how far are you willing to go for the cause? I worked c-construction for 15 years. Then they gave my job to some wetback. My wife left me, took my daughter with her. (chuckles) I ain't got nothing to lose. Life's a bitch, Lincoln. But no one trash-talks the Citizens' Army of Virginia. (click) (laughter) You got big balls, Lincoln. I'll give you that. Come on. (chuckles) Is this how this works? Huh? Does that mean I'm in? It means the Founding Father wants to meet you. Well, when? Tomorrow. (boom) What the hell? Man (over speaker) : This is the ATF. Get on the ground! Hands on your head and drop your weapons! ATF! Streeter, we got to get you out of here. Come on! Come on! (gunfire) Let's go! This way! ATF! Get on the ground! (grunts) (gunshot) (grunts) (gunshot) (grunts) I'd have appreciated a heads-up the ATF was coming. (British accent): I didn't know. (panting) I have no idea why they're here. Lose the gun, Russell. Lose it. Put your hands on your head. Do it now. Don't move! Do not even breathe! Easy, boys. I'm FBI. Covert Operations. And he's with me. Clearance code Foxtrot-Echo-Zulu. Dispatch, I need cover code confirmation. Foxtrot-Echo-Zulu. Woman : Copy that. Checking now. Six months. That's how long I've been under, six months. And you blow my cover for a weapons bust. Foxtrot-Echo-Zulu cleared, sir. We came here to serve a warrant to seize illegal firearms. We're not taking the fall for this. You're more worried about covering your ass than stopping a terrorist attack. What are you talking about? What terrorist attack? (click) (groans) Grenade! So, who are you? Martin Odum. (panting) Call it in. Hey, kid. (chuckles) Dad! Come here. (chuckles) Hey, look at you. I didn't know you were coming. I missed you. I'm sorry I didn't call, but... I thought about you every day. Did you get 'em? The bad guys? Yeah. Yeah, I got 'em. I knew you would. Wow, look at you. Six months, you must've grown a foot. A half inch since you left. I've been keeping track. (chuckles) And, Dad, I can do this trick with the ball where I can, like, flip it. I mean, I can almost do it, but I just need to work on it. Yeah, I saw you. Martin. Hi, Sonya. Hey, I, uh... just brought around your check. Go inside so I can talk to your dad, honey. Mom, he just got here. That's okay, Aiden. I can't stay. Listen, maybe I'll cook you dinner tomorrow night, huh? Chinese. Huh? Awesome. Can't wait. See you then. (chuckles) Didn't know you were back. I'm sorry. I should've... You can't just pop back up after months of being gone and expect everything to be the same. They're not. I'm sorry. I'll get going. Martin, you signed the check Lincoln Dittmann? What? You signed the check Lincoln Dittmann. Martin, where you going? Hey, your grocery! (indistinct chatter) (phone ringing) Yeah. It's Russell. I told you not to use this number. You dumped Lincoln's cell. How else am I supposed to contact you? I'm calling from a pay phone anyway. What do you want, Russell? Streeter reached out to me this morning. The Citizens' Army is back in business. Russell, be smart for once in your life. Walk away. The Founding Father wants a sit-down with Lincoln Dittmann. Face-to-face. Tomorrow. Sit-down for what? Streeter says after the ATF raid, we got to hit back hard. He says this is the big one, what they were planning before. I'll make the arrangements. Man :  How long has Russell Stillman  been your C.I.? Two years. He's the one who got me into the Citizens' Army in the first place. How do you know they're not using him to set a trap? I don't. But that's a chance we've got to take. Woman : Here's the status on the Bellevue case. What's he doing here? Lincoln Dittmann's still in play. The Founding Father wants to meet Dittmann tomorrow in Chicago. Sir... Ellroy Streeter has already sent a plane ticket and a rental car key to Lincoln's Arizona P.O. box. He wants Lincoln to meet him at a strip club outside O'Hare tomorrow afternoon. Sir, that mess in Virginia happened because Martin refused to loop us in. Nothing from you in six months, not a word. Then I get a call that you crash an ATF weapons bust, and I'm still cleaning up after you. The last time I looped you in, one of your people blew my cover. So... forgive me if I didn't send you a memo. Martin, can you give us a moment, please? Excuse me. I have tried running him for two years. It doesn't work. You're acting like we got a choice in this. He's got some kind of personality disorder. Three out of four shrinks on the committee found him unfit for duty. What did the fourth shrink say? "That he's the most naturally gifted "deep cover operative that we've got and maybe the best that we've ever had." Crystal, we're talking about an imminent attack on U.S. soil. Now, I know we're taking a risk in reactivating him, but I'm more concerned about the risk if we don't. (sighs) You need to debrief my group. Before you do, just wipe that smirk off your face. Just trying to be civil. Do not patronize me. How long do you plan on being pissed off at me? I run Field Ops. One of my people goes off the grid, it makes me look bad. I didn't mean to undermine your authority. What did you think would happen when you went AWOL? I'm sorry. I'm also curious. That the only reason you're mad at me? Don't flatter yourself, Martin. We were consenting adults. We made a mistake. Happens every day. (distorted voice):  Today...  true patriots fought back against the so-called president, who is a puppet for international bankers... (beep) We don't even know who he is, except that he calls himself the Founding Father. He's the most dangerous domestic terrorist in the country. And now he's gonna try to top himself. Except that we're no closer to finding him now than we were three years ago. Well, it sounds like Odum got close. The guy's a rock star. Sure, Odum was good. But he should've been put out to pasture a long time ago. And I'm not the only one who thinks so. Don't let me stop you, Buchanan. I'm done. Martin, this is Maggie Harris. She joined the team last month to help out Bobby with analytics and field support. Hi, Maggie. We actually have something in common. I'm an Air Force brat, too. Oh. Only my father was never stationed overseas, so I didn't get a cool accent out of the deal. (soft laugh) Lots to cover, let's get started. Russell Stillman, former member of the Aryan Brotherhood, until he found God. Became the best asset I've ever recruited. Ellroy Streeter. The Founding Father's top lieutenant. Tossed by the 82nd Airborne for striking his superior officer. If you're meeting Streeter tomorrow, we don't have a lot of time to work out tac support. I'll make sure the follow team gets to you within two minutes. Make it five. Two minutes is standard. Streeter knows counter-surveillance. Two minutes is too close. I'm down with the whole respect-your-enemy drill, but aren't you giving these guys too much credit? Martin knows these guys better than any of us, plus he's the one that's inside. It's his call. Fine. Five minutes. Before they activate Dittmann, they're gonna dig deeper into his background. Yeah, we need to build up his history. It's already built. In here. Then start sharing, because you're not flying solo anymore. Lincoln was a demolitions engineer for a  construction company in Arizona. Come on, set those charges. He was good at his job. But his job took him away from home so much that his wife... finally left him. He tried getting her to take him back. But it was too late. So he lost his wife. Then the recession hit  and he lost his job. He took it hard. Couldn't get back on his feet. Got upside-down on his mortgage, buried in debt. Children? A daughter. Ellie-May. Oh, and Ellie-May has special needs. What in the hell are you talking about? Ellie, dinner's ready, honey. Lincoln is socially awkward, highly insecure. He's got a persecution complex  and a... stutter. If he's that angry, there should be a record. I'm building up his e-mails, and I'll post backdated comments in chat rooms. As his savings dried up, his writing  grew more strident. More extreme. I'm giving him a credit history that shows him falling behind on bills, getting deeper into debt. It's not fair. I did everything right. Learned a trade,  worked hard. (American accent):  I deserve...  b-better... (British accent): What? You stuttered and your accent changed. You didn't notice? Go home. We'll backfill the legend. (line ringing) Aiden (on voice mail) :  Hey, this is Aiden. You missed me. Leave a message. Hi, Aiden. It's Dad. Um... look, I'm really, really sorry, but I've-I've got some bad news. Something's come up and they need me back at work. Um... I don't think I'm gonna be able to get together with you tomorrow, but, listen, I will make it up to you. Give me a call when you get this. I love you, son. (grunts) What do you want? Huh? Why are you following me? (grunts) I'm trying to help you. What the hell are you talking about? You don't know where your life begins and your legend ends. Who are you? I don't know. Who are you? Who do you think you are? (both grunting) You really think you're Martin Odum? There is no Martin Odum. He's a legend. Everything about him is fake. (door opens) Trust no one. No one! (dance music playing) (loud knocking at door) (music shuts off) Trying to give yourself a heart attack? Prevent one. My cholesterol sucks, and my doctor says I need to do more cardio. I hate the gym. Need a favor, Bobby. Well, technically, you outrank me, so you can just order me to do that. This is off book. Just between us. I'm hoping you can clean this up enough to make an ID. It's from a subway security camera. What's this about? Maybe nothing. Probably nothing. But just keep it... Between us. Got it. Let me just download it to my hard drive and... Okay, stop it there. I'll run it through facial recognition and get back to you when I have something. Thanks, Bobby. Martin... I know you don't think so, but it's a good thing, letting us watch your back tomorrow. We're gonna stop these guys. Right? Don't worry, Bobby. We'll get 'em. Crystal :  Your flight's in two hours. We'll be an hour behind you. The Chicago field office is prepped for your arrival. Streeter will have eyes on it. I'm not going anywhere near there. Just make sure you stay in contact. Lincoln's debit card, ID, cell phone, picture of his daughter. Streeter sent a plane ticket to Dittmann's P.O. box in Phoenix. Already in there. Dittmann's boarding pass and baggage claim receipt. I'm impressed. Well, hopefully the Founding Father will be, too. Omnidirectional mic with a built-in GPS pulse. Ah. A leash. A lifeline. I told you, Streeter has a serious hard-on about counter-surveillance. Put it on, keep it on. When you make contact with the Founding Father, I'll send in the tac team. We'll be five minutes from the strip club. Yeah. Woman (over P.A.) : Flight 425 to Savannah, final boarding. (chuckles) (American accent): Guys... You guys. (knocking at door) Man : Hey, buddy, hurry up. I got a plane to catch! I'll be... right out. Martin : Streeter and Rand are approaching now. Copy that. We got eyes on you. Martin : Hey! (laughs) That was crazy back in V-Virginia. Give Rand the car keys. (Martin chuckling) Martin : The Founding Father? He's really gonna meet us here? Streeter : Stop asking so many damn questions. 
 
 Excuse me. What is it? I don't know if this is a problem, but just in case it's a problem... Russell Stillman's supposed to check in with me every hour, right? Yeah. Five minutes late. Crystal, we may have a situation here. Stillman hasn't checked in. Check his motel room. Be discreet. If he's not there, find him. Man :  Tell me again... You believe in the cause, Russell? You're the Founding Father. I believe in you, and you gotta know... I'm not a traitor. Neither is Lincoln. Data can be planted... records manipulated. People... people always tell the truth in the end. (electricity buzzing) Russell : No. No! (screams) Thanks. Our people checked Stillman's motel room, and there's evidence of a struggle. Okay, if they break Stillman, Martin's dead. Isn't there a way we can pull him out? No. We'd lose our only chance of stopping this attack. He has to know that he may have been compromised. He's already under, Maggie. There's no way to make contact. Not necessarily. Hey. Give me the keys. Buchanan : Crystal, what are you doing? Man :  Next up we've got Lovely Linda on the main stage. Hey... (gasps) ♪ ♪ Isn't she supposed to c-call? Just sit back and enjoy the view. Hey, boys. Which one of you wants to help the economy with a private dance? (giggles) I'm Star. What's your name, sweetie? His name's Lincoln. Oh. Well, Lincoln here... he looks like he could use a little TLC. (laughs) What the hell's she doing? TLC... tatas, legs and, uh... Park the mouth, Mehta. Don't you worry, sweetheart. You just watch. Let me do the work. Don't insult the lady, Lincoln. (Crystal giggles) One song. Change your life. Go get her. (giggles) I had to talk to you. Careful. Stay in character. Camera. ♪ Tell that there's the pedigree ♪ 
♪ Experience is another one meant for me ♪ 
♪ But tell me now ♪ 
♪  Tell me now  ♪ 
♪ And show me how ♪ 
♪ Show me how ♪ 
♪ To understand ♪ 
♪  Understand...  ♪ Did it ever occur to you that Crystal is a cool stripper's name? I'll be sure to tell my mother that you said so. Russell Stillman never checked in with Maggie. We have to assume that the Founding Father has him. Got to pull you out of this. Russell wouldn't rat me out. Oh. What makes you so sure? Three years ago, the Aryan Brotherhood ordered a hit on him over a meth deal. I ran interference. Are you willing to bet your life on that? I already have. (phone chimes) _ You'd better go. The camera. There? Oh, it's just a smoke detector. (sighs) (laughs) Oh. Hey. Song's not over yet, sport. (laughs) Let's go, Lincoln. We have a schedule. Okay. Sorry. (groans) (static) They made him. Legend's blown. How do you know? I read people. That's what I do. Move the follow team in now. Follow team's still five minutes away, just like Martin wanted. Tell them to get moving. Move it, dead man. Hey. What are you doing? Founding Father still has some doubts about you, Lincoln, and Russell... well, he didn't live long enough to put them to rest. Our man's in trouble. Follow team, what's your ETA? We're still three and a half minutes out. On your knees, Lincoln. (grunts) Crystal : Hey, you owe me 50 bucks! Shouldn't have come out here, sweetheart. Crystal : You want money? I got cash. (grunts) (laughing) What's so damn funny? (laughing) You think that I am afraid to die? I'm already d-dead. Don't you know? Know what? I have stage four c-c-cancer. I just... I just didn't want to die before I made my m-mark. He's improvising. He's giving the follow team time to get there. Buchanan : Follow team's still two minutes out. (line ringing) Streeter? Dittmann says he's dying of cancer. Ask him where he was diagnosed. Where were you diagnosed? Arizona Medical Center. Tucson. Talk to me, Maggie. I'll give him, uh, Ewing's sarcoma, first detected when he complained of pain in his right knee. Awesome. (beeps) Chemo and radiation non-responsive after three rounds of doxorubicin, and another three of methotrexate? Beautiful. Doctor's name? Who was your doctor? Claude Metzger. (keyboard keys click, beep, trilling) (trilling, beep) No records for a Lincoln Dittmann at that hospital. No records. You're lying. That's impossible. I uploaded everything. I don't understand. Follow team, what's your ETA? 60 seconds. (Crystal gasps) Are you sure he's spelling it right? Two Ns! Dittmann has two Ns! (computer trilling) (beeping) Stand down, Streeter. He's good. (phone beeps off) Lucky day, Lincoln. You checked out. (Crystal sighs) What about her? (Crystal panting) Martin : Let her go. She doesn't know anything. We don't need any more c-c-complications. Please. Please. I've been around long enough to keep my mouth shut. I'm like a priest, I swear. I swear. You say anything to anyone, I'll find you. Get lost. (gasps) Let's go. Follow team, drive past target. I say again, do not engage. Man : Roger that. Driving by target. Buchanan : Crystal, what's your status? I'm clear. Use cash, lay low. We'll contact you. So when is this happening? Tonight. You hear that? Call Gates. Gates :  Financial ministers from the G7  will be at the IMF summit tonight. There's a whole media event planned at the Willis Tower to announce the economic cooperation agreement. If that gets hit, that could turn the recession into a full-blown depression. As far as high-value targets go, it doesn't get any better. It's not just a symbolic target. 10,000 people work there. Buchanan : We'll work up a threat assessment and alert all relevant law enforcement agencies. Gates : I want everyone here on standby for when Streeter calls Dittmann. Everyone. (car engine idling outside) (gun clicks) (car engine shuts off) (car door opens) (car door closes) (knocking) You took a risk coming here. Oh, we did a sweep. They're not watching the motel. Well, what's going on? I wanted to tell you in person. Chicago PD found Russell's body in a vacant lot near the river. It looks like he was tortured. (sighs) You were right about him holding out. Not breaking. Oh, we should do something for his family. Um... he mentioned a sister in Kentucky. Lexington, I think. I don't think that's appropriate, Martin. But he was my C.I. He risked his life for me. He was also a card-carrying member of the Aryan Brotherhood. Yeah, well, people change, Crystal. He changed. Became someone else. You saved the operation today. All right, it's not how I would've done it, but... you kept your composure, you preserved your cover. You know, we have a chance of actually stopping this thing. I-I-It was... impressive. Wow. I bet that wasn't easy for you to say. You have no idea. (cell phone ringing) I have to take this. (sighs) Hello, th-th-this is Lincoln. No, I'm alone. Yeah, I... I can g-g-get there. (clicks tongue) You-you got it. (places phone on the desk) I meet the Founding Father tonight. As we reported earlier, the treasury secretary has been in negotiations all day with finance ministers from the G7 member nations and the heads of major banks from around the world. This IMF summit hosted by the U.S. treasury secretary... Hey! Get in. Alpha Team? They're moving east on Van Buren. Copy that. Keeping a two-block buffer. Martin : Don't ever get divorced. Streeter : I'll make a note of that. Martin : My wife was a good woman. But I treated her like dirt. Everything that went bad was all my f-f-f... Streeter : All your fault... got it. You can stop talking now. He's talking about himself, isn't he? First rule of undercover... make the lie as close as possible to the truth. Okay. They're turning into an alleyway between Adams and Jackson. The only place that's listed here is an auto repair shop. All set. Wow. C4. Guess how much. 500 pounds? Six. "All talk, no action," huh? (quiet laugh) Here you go, Officer... "Barczak." I see t-two hats. Does that mean I'm going in with you? You'll be going in with me. Sorry about Russell, but we couldn't take any chances. Sometimes a good soldier has to fall for a good cause. Crystal : Alpha and Delta Team standing by. Waiting to confirm target. The police staging area is right here, next to where the bankers and their puppets are selling out this country. You'll be firing the first shot of the next American Revolution. Ready to make history? Yes, sir. That's what I signed up for. Except I di-didn't see a detonator in the car. I've got it. Once we're inside the perimeter, you'll let me out. And as soon as you get close enough... So... so you're not going in with me. Listen to me. We've all got our parts to play, right? I'm your Founding Father. And I will be your witness. So I can tell the people who Lincoln Dittmann really was. Yes, sir. Right? Yes, sir. Okay. Get your uniform on. It's time. Alpha, Delta, target is confirmed. Target confirmed. Stand by to breach on my count. (indistinct radio transmission) Sir? I'm picking up radio communication just outside this building. Let me hear it. Crystal : Repeat, maintain fire discipline. We have a man inside. Repeat... man inside. (men grunting) Agent : FBI! Agent 2 : FBI! Drop your weapons! FBI! Empty your hands! Show me your hands! Show me your hands! Stay back! Or I'll take this whole place down! Drop it! It's a dead man's switch! You shoot me, my finger goes off the trigger. And everyone dies. You. Get behind the wheel. We're driving out of here together. No. You won't. You stand down or I swear I'll take us all out. Right here, right now! I don't think so. If you were gonna do it, you would've done it already. Streeter : What are you waiting for? Do it! You heard him. Go ahead. Do it. Do it! That's right. You wanted me to do it. So you could watch. Yeah? (grunts) Bomb's clear! All right, we're clear. (indistinct radio transmission) Where are you going? Martin! (panting) Man :  You don't know where your life begins and your legend ends. There is no Martin Odum! (computer beeping) _ Bring it on, bitch. (muffled grunting) I'm really sorry about your C.I. Thanks. Thanks for backing me up. I'm not the best team player. Learned that about myself. That's what Bobby said. Not in a bad way. (laughs) (chuckles) Where is Bobby? I don't know. I haven't seen him. (door opens) (line ringing) This is Bobby. Can't pick up the phone right now, so leave a message and don't be boring. (line beeps) (knocking) Martin : Bobby? (loud dance music playing) Bobby? (door closes) Bobby. Man :  You really think you're Martin Odum? There is no Martin Odum! Martin :  I need a favor, Bobby. I'm hoping you can clean this up enough to make an ID. Trust no one! (shudders) Hello. Are you ready to listen? I've been ready to listen. Now I want some answers. What is this? My friend died trying to find out who you are. I told you not to tell anyone. Look! I want to know what the hell is going on! Listen to me. Meet me at Union Station. Platform six. I need to give you something. What? Hurry. I'm being followed. They'll kill me if they get the chance. Who will? Hurry! Just get here! Stay on the line. I want you to answer some questions. (tires screech) Tell me what happened! You were never supposed to remember. Remember what? (car horn drones) I got to get out of here. Wait. I'm just pulling up now. (tires screech) Listen, I'm coming! All right? I'm here. I don't see you. I'm almost on the platform. Just wait! Been waiting too long. They're probably watching. (grunts) Who's watching?! Are you there? Hey! Hey! They don't want you to know the truth. They don't want you to know who you are. Who doesn't? There's a book, left pocket. The answer's in there. I didn't find it in time. But you can. Tell me who you are. I don't know. Who am I? Who am I?! Woman : 911... there's an emergency. (continues indistinctly) (overlapping chatter) Man : Hey, lady, call 911!
