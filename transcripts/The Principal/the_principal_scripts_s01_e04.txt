 Tarek : Have you seen Mum's necklace? 
 It's just his girlfriend, mate, I've seen her wearing it. 
 Are you sure? 
 Did you steal the necklace? 
 No! 
 (GASPS) 
 I was wondering if you could tell me if your son, Chris, knew a Matt Bashir? 
 Ursula : I don't know if you've noticed, but there is more than one student at this school. 
 Tarek is not one student -- he's everything about this place that is wrong. 
 It looks like he's just been for a run. 
 Yeah, but why run in the middle of the night? 
 Maybe there's more than one person he's afraid of -- a kid that was bullying him, a teacher... 
 Ursula : What's going on? 
 I'm going down to the station to help these men with their investigation. 
 Sir, Mr Karidis said that I can't do work experience. 
 Sir? 
 Tarek, I can't help you right now. 
 Work experience is a privilege. It's not a right. 
 Tarek. 
 Tarek, Tarek. Come back to class. Come on. 
 Not unless he says that I'm still going. 
 We can't possibly risk sending you on work experience after the way you behaved. 
 Why? Because the dumb-fuck faggot there thinks I'm not up to it? 
 I'm backing his decision, and that sort of language... 
 You know, it's not up to youse. You know what? 
 It's up to Mr Bashir. 
 And where is he anyway? Why is he with the pigs? 
 He's helping police with their investigation. 
 Just come back to class, mate. Alright? Come on. 
 Youse can't cancel work experience because it's already organised. 
 Well, we just did. 
 Sef's going in your place. 
 Come back. Tarek! 
 The victim's brother, Tarek, what's he like? 
 Difficult. 
 Aggressive at times. 
 He's had it tough. 
 Was it like that for you at school? 
 Of course not. 
 He's lost his mother, his brother -- you can't even compare. 
 But you feel for Tarek, right? 
 I mean, otherwise you wouldn't close the door with him in your office. 
 I closed it once, briefly. 
 He was distressed about his brother. 
 Matt : (ON ANSWERING MACHINE) Matt Bashir. 
 Please leave a message and I'll get back to you. 
 Mr Bashir, it's me. Tarek. 
 Mr Karidis has ruined everything. 
 I'm not going to take... 
 You know, the problem with these rules and regulations is that kids like Tarek who need comfort from someone they can trust... 
 (BREATHES DEEPLY) 
 .. they can't get it. 
 But the profound flaw is that... is that other students... kids in desperation, really... they take advantage of those rules. 
 Like the student at Lakehurst Girls in 2005. 
 That accusation was dropped. 
 Yeah. Of course. 
 The truth can often be a long way from the way it appears. 
 What's this? 
 That image was taken from a CCTV camera two weeks prior to Karim's murder. 
 Would you agree that that is, in fact, you in the photograph? 
 I was catching my breath after a run around the quadrangle. 
 Were there any other staff or students present? 
 No, I was alone. 
 Why run at school? 
 Why not... closer to where you live? 
 Because when I get out of the car at the end of the day, I like to relax. 
 I like to put it all behind me. 
 Woman : Nick, my husband, went back to Brisbane after Chris died to be with his family. 
 He tried staying here, but everything remind him of Chris... including me. 
 We had the same eyes. 
 You said Chris was beaten up. 
 It started in year 10. 
 He came home with cuts and bruises and a split lip. 
 He told us he'd copped a battering at footy... but when it happened a second time, Nick got it out of him. 
 A gang of boys had decided to target him. 
 This was at Boxdale? 
 Why? 
 Chris was a great football player... but he was... different, you know? 
 And the boys sensed it. 
 We tried sending him to Lakemba High, but he wouldn't have it. 
 Just... refused to go. 
 Recognise him? 
 Kenny Mavondo. 
 Who, as we have uncovered, was concealing drugs for Karim. 
 Now, as you'll notice is this 24-hour time stamped with the same date as that one. 
 You said you were alone. 
 Well... I was alone and then afterwards I heard a noise coming from the opposite building and I went to check it out and that's when I found Kenny crouched at the entrance. 
 What was he doing? 
 He said that he was doing his homework. 
 He said that it was noisy and crowded where he was living. 
 I spoke to him about it and then sent him home. 
 On the night of Karim's murder, you said you went straight home. 
 Now, if you left the school straight after the P&C meeting at 9.30 as you said, that would put you through the Western Link tunnel at around 10.20pm. 
 Records show it was almost an hour later. 
 I put to you, Mr Bashir, that given that time frame... you didn't drive straight home. 
 Where were you in that missing hour? 
 I stopped at a park. 
 What park was that? 
 Kings Road, Riverstone. 
 And what was the reason for your stop? 
 Take some time out just to sit. 
 Was anyone else present or... were you alone? 
 I was alone. 
 Are you sure? 
 Yes. 
 (SIGHS) 
 I've cancelled your midmorning and the one at noon. 
 Uh-huh. 
 Sorry. And I need a signature. 
 Oh, what is it? 
 Proposal to host Eid celebrations here at the school. 
 Uh... I'm not sure how wise that is in the current climate. 
 What about our non-Muslim kids? 
 They enjoy a good feed just as much as anybody else. 
 Look, it's fine. Matt's across it. 
 Um... Matt's not here. 
 It will bring the school and the community closer together, which is, presumably, what we all want. 
 Besides, once they smell the food, they won't be able to stay away. 
 You've never tasted food like it in your life. 
 Oh, OK. Leave it with me. I'll have a look. 
 Ursula, Dino's on the Skype for you. 
 Oh, dammit! 
 (KNOCKS ON DOOR) 
 It can wait. 
 It can't. 
 I spoke to the mother of a boy Bashir went to school with. 
 She had some information I think I should pass on. 
 Someone just tweeted Matt was seen being brought into the police station. 
 (SIGHS) 
 The director-general wants me to call him in an hour. 
 f*ck! 
 We'll never contain this. 
 It's a public relations disaster. 
 Well, I'm not sure the Ahmad family would see it that way. 
 This school has been front-page news before. 
 It's nothing a bit of damage control can't fix. 
 Well, we won't recover from this. 
 If we don't act, the Department will end up looking like a limp dick. 
 Heaven forbid. 
 We'll have to give serious thought to restructuring our assets. 
 In other words, merge us with another poorly performing school or close us down entirely? 
 Would've happened eventually. 
 You can't get rid of the only public school in the district! 
 Belmore and Lakemba are at full capacity. 
 Where are the kids going to go? 
 They will have to avail themselves of our very efficient state railway system. 
 And Bashir's appointment? What was that? 
 OK. 
 This is in the cone. 
 I don't think anyone here seriously thought that he'd succeed. 
 If you keep it to yourself, you'll be looked after. 
 (SIGHS) 
 Yep. 
 OK. 
 Will do. 
 sh1t. 
 What's that? 
 The social worker said Kenny Mavondo's done a runner. 
 What happened? 
 Jumped out of the car when it was stopped at the lights on the corner of Robey and Wattle Street, Greenacre. 
 He's not doing himself any favours. 
 I'll organise a search. 
 Maroon sweater, navy pants, white sneakers. 
 Right, got it. 
 Who's interviewing Alma Bivas? 
 Mideast Crime. 
 I was thinking what a coincidence it must have seemed like. 
 I mean, here you were, you know, hoping for a promotion to principal, and the first job that comes up is at your old school. 
 It's a weird coincidence. 
 I mean, my mother didn't believe in it. 
 She said, "Everything happens for a reason." 
 I think if you're done asking questions about Karim, I need to get back to my job. 
 But my sister on the other hand, now, she's the lefty in the family, she's got this idea that things happen because something deep inside your subconscious, if you like, needs to work things through. 
 What has any of this have to do with Karim's murder? 
 Well, my point is is... 
 It can't have been easy for you to go back to your old high school, no less as principal... especially when the place holds such unpleasant memories for you. 
 The death of Chris Langworthy, for example. 
 How well did you know Chris? 
 We played footy together. 
 Did you? 
 What position were you? 
 Inside centre. 
 What about Chris? 
 Outside centre. 
 Oh, right. So, you had a bit of a shorthand going? 
 I mean, did you consider yourself mates? 
 (YELLS DISTANTLY) 
 Um... At one stage, yes. 
 It's just... such a tragedy. 
 17 years old, strong football player, yeah? 
 With his whole bright future in front of him. 
 And in one afternoon, a group of bullies, thugs, beat the sh1t out of him. 
 And within a week... he hangs himself. 
 After the funeral, they found this under Chris' mattress. 
 (BREATHES DEEPLY) 
 You must have been special to him. 
 During this attack... where were you? 
 I wanted them to stop. 
 How many boys were involved? 
 A half-dozen at least. 
 And of these six boys, how many were trying to protect Chris? 
 I see. 
 You were outnumbered. 
 (SOBS) 
 (SNIFFS) 
 They had him on the ground. 
 (DISTANT YELLING) 
 And I just stood there and watched. 
 I thought they were going to stop, but they didn't. 
 They just kept going. (SOBS) 
 Obviously if you had tried to help they would have turned on you. 
 He looked up at me. 
 He had blood in his eyes, but... he saw me. 
 He saw right through me. 
 These were savages. 
 Animals, yes? 
 I was no better than them. 
 I kicked the sh1t out of him. 
 (SOBS) 
 Not because I was scared or outnumbered, because in that moment, I hated him. 
 Help! 
 Was it Chris that you hated, or yourself? 
 (SNIFFS) 
 You were more than just mates. 
 Maybe... 
 Maybe you tried to bury that when they buried Chris. 
 But you and I both know that you can't really bury who you truly are... no matter how hard you try. 
 So, Mr Bashir, I have to ask you... that night after you left the P&C meeting and stopped at a park, were you with someone? 
 (SIGHS) 
 Who was it? 
 I don't know. 
 Was that person an adult? 
 Yes! 
 And who was it? 
 I don't know. 
 Why don't you know? 
 Because I never got his name. 
 You have chosen to teach at an all boys school, despite its appalling reputation. 
 You have been accused of improper conduct with a student in the past, and you have formed close relations with the number of vulnerable young students including the victim's brother. 
 Now, you need to find this stranger who you say you were with in the missing 55 minutes on the night Karim was murdered and you need him to contact me. 
 Otherwise... I can't help you. 
 I'll run you back to school. 
 I'll get a taxi. It's fine. 
 Man : You right there, mate? 
 Kellie : Hey. 
 How did you go with Matt Bashir? 
 Good, good. Thanks for that, by the way. 
 You keep up the good work and you might find yourself a real job. 
 f*ck's sake. 
 No, I haven't forgotten to pick up the baby capsule at 4.45. 
 She's nervous. 
 Yeah, well, she's making me nervous. Not due yet. 
 Hey, I found a couple of quotes from Mohammad Ahmad from back issues of a local paper speaking out against extremists. 
 It's maybe why he got a brick through his window couple of months back. 
 He's a moderate Shiite. 
 Alma and Sami are Sunnis who clashed with his son. 
 Maybe Mohammad and Karim had something over them. 
 Hmm. 
 Anyway, I've got to go down to the school. 
 Are you going to fill me in on Bashir or what? 
 He's still a suspect. 
 Is that it? 
 Well, your suspicion about him was correct. 
 He's batting for the other side. 
 How did it go? 
 Fine. 
 (MICROWAVE BEEPS) 
 Dino wants you to call him. 
 (SCHOOL BELL RINGS) 
 That's the bell. Let's go. 
 Excuse me, I'm bloody hungry! 
 Well, some kids are going for 12 hours without food for Ramadan, I think you'll manage just fine. 
 Sef, jacket off, please. 
 Sir, it's blue. 
 If that's blue, then you're colourblind. Off. 
 Wear a tie tomorrow, please. 
 You should call Dino sooner rather than later. 
 He's pretty keen to speak with you. 
 I think we should sort out these kids first. 
 Tarek seemed pretty upset. Has he calmed down? 
 He took off. 
 What happened? 
 Why would you take away the last hope that kid has left? 
 Because he threatened me! 
 He went feral. You saw him. 
 And you didn't think to speak to me about it first? 
 You weren't here! I backed his decision. 
 He doesn't deserve to go! 
 He was out of control. 
 So, we don't let him go and he misses his chance? 
 And what are we left with? 
 Another train wreck. 
 But that's not George's fault. 
 No. 
 And it's not mine. 
 No, it isn't. 
 But unless Tarek, unless any of these kids gets taste of how it could be, how they could be, then they are not going to fight to get there. 
 Something has to change. 
 Otherwise we're wasting our time. 
 I didn't think you'd come. 
 I made a commitment to be here every week. 
 You know, I never trust cops as a kid, and you just reminded me why. 
 We want to find out who killed Karim. 
 So do I! 
 And the only were we can do that... 
 You seriously think that it was me? 
 Who do you think I am? 
 I don't know! Nobody does! 
 You keep your lid pretty tightly shut. 
 You never mention your family, friends... 
 That's my business. 
 Fine, but if you give nothing away, then people are left to guess and there is every chance that they're going to get it wrong. 
 That's what this is about? 
 You're gay. Just f*cking face it. 
 I can't. 
 Why not? 
 'Cause this is what happens -- people blame you for things that you have no control over. 
 Like Chris's suicide? 
 (SIGHS) 
 What happened? 
 I was 16... My father drank. He was very violent. When he found Chris and I together, he made sure that I would never shame him again. 
 Chris' mother blamed me for it. 
 She decided... it was my fault that he hung himself. 
 Was it? 
 (SIGHS) 
 I told him I had no feelings for him. 
 I turned back on him. 
 You were 16 years old. 
 You were scared. 
 I beat him up like the rest of them. 
 Forgive yourself. 
 You have to. 
 
 
 
 OK, boys, we're going to pair up. We're going to spar. 
 So, Bilal, Sisi. 
 No way! 
 Oh, f*ck off, Muzzie, your mum's a slut! 
 Hey! 
 I'm not sparring with a murderer. 
 That's enough. 
 Yeah, go shave your legs, you f*cking poofter. 
 Sisi, do you want to stay here or do you want to go back to class? 
 Here. 
 OK. Well, sit down. 
 Now, sit down. 
 (SIGHS) f*ck. 
 Keep going. 
 Go. 
 f*cking hell. 
 I hate them, Miss. 
 These Lebs, these f*cking Muzzies. I hate them all. 
 Why? - 'Cause they blame us for everything. 
 What, they think that they're better than us? 
 Karim's old man never picks up Polys. 
 Threw my cousin out of his cab and threatened to bash him. 
 This is Mohammad Ahmad? 
 Yeah. 
 His own son, Miss. 
 His own son was a drug dealer and he accuses my cousin for being one? 
 Karim was a sneaky lowlife piece of sh1t. 
 f*cking deserved to die. 
 (PHONE BEEPS) 
 Ursula : You didn't say what was happening with the police. 
 They're following a number of suspects... one who appears to be me. 
 Oh, sorry to hear that. 
 You didn't tell police that I closed the door with Tarek in my office? 
 No, I did not. 
 Well, they're insinuating that I've been interfering with some of the boys. 
 Oh, for God's sake -- just because you're gay doesn't make you a paedophile. 
 This can wait. 
 Do you think Sami and his mates are susceptible to terrorist groups? 
 Possibly. Is this about Alma? 
 Yeah, well, she admitted to making some of those calls to that friend of her husband's, but when they showed her the call log, she suddenly admitted to making quite a few more. 
 What happened? 
 Well, we had to let her go. 
 Do you think Mohammad knew Karim was selling drugs? 
 He didn't seem to. Why? 
 It's just something that Sisi said. 
 Mohammad kicked Sisi's cousin out of his taxi -- accused him of being a drug dealer, threatened him. 
 Any record of that? 
 Not here, but there could be other complaints. 
 I'm thinking if he did know, the humiliation could have tipped him over. 
 I was serious, you know. 
 You should really apply to train as a detective. 
 Why? 
 I like my job. 
 I want to be part of the solution, not mop up the problems. 
 I'm going to head out to the cab company, see what I can find out. 
 Sami? 
 Yeah, Sami? 
 (PHONE RINGS) 
 Good afternoon, Boxdale High. How can I help you? 
 Hello? Sorry, can you repeat that? 
 Oh, Alma Bivas rang looking for Sami. 
 He seems to have given himself an early mark. 
 What time is it due to explode? 
 Oh, again? 
 Great, there goes the Year 10 History test. 
 Right. What sort of bomb is it? 
 Hello! Hello... 
 Gone. 
 Any details? 
 Pretty unconvincing if you ask me. Sounded like a helium balloon. 
 2 o'clock he says it's going to go off. 
 I'll call the police. 
 No, not this time. 
 We can't ignore it. 
 Yes, we can. 
 We can't be held to ransom every time a student decides they want to get off class. 
 Well, we have to follow procedure. 
 And the kids know that. That's why they get away with it. 
 Val, how many bomb scares have we had this year? 
 24. 
 25 if you count this one. 
 And how many explosions have we had? 
 None. 
 And what if this one time it really is real? 
 If someone's going to blow you up, they don't give you a warning, for God's sake, they just do it. 
 Exactly. We're staying put. 
 Bravo. 
 (CLOCK TICKS LOUDLY) 
 f*ck! 
 (CLOCK TICKS LOUDLY) 
 (CLOCK TICKS LOUDLY) 
 (TICKING FADES) 
 Look at that. We're still here. 
 (URSULA SIGHS) 
 Just as well. (CHUCKLES) 
 I'd better call my mate, Dino. 
 I'd watch him if I were you. 
 He's not your mate. 
 He's all I have. 
 Hafa : You did the right thing, Alma. 
 A 16-year-old boy in that war? 
 He would never survive. 
 He will never forgive me. 
 I know. 
 Why can't you just trust me? 
 I want to. 
 Oh, f*ck, Lucinda. 
 Did you kill Karim? 
 What do you reckon? 
 That's him. That's Kenny. 
 (SIREN CHIRPS) 
 Tarek : (OVER PHONE) Mr Bashir, it's me, Tarek. 
 Mr Karidis has ruined everything. I'm not going to take it. 
 Have you seen George? 
 He's on sick leave. 
 I gave him last period off. 
 Did he go home? 
 Well, I presume so. 
 That man needs to grow a thicker skin. 
 (KNOCKS ON DOOR) 
 (SIGHS) 
 You're not answering your phone. 
 Sorry, I'm... I'm on overload. 
 Are you OK? 
 Yeah, I'll be fine. 
 But you know what? 
 I'm not sure I'm cut out for teaching. 
 George, you're a great teacher -- you just need better support, that's all. 
 Those kids are ruthless. 
 They push and they push and they go on with all this sh1t -- calling me a faggot which is completely unacceptable and kind of annoying, 'cause I'm actually not one. 
 Well, I am. 
 Mate, that's... fine. 
 Whatever floats your boat. 
 Really, look, all I was trying to say was... 
 George, I've got to go. Just don't quit teaching yet, OK? 
 Hang in there. We'll sort it out. 
 And don't answer the door. 
 If Tarek gets in touch with you, call me, alright? 
 (PHONE VIBRATES) 
 Mohammad Ahmad. 
 Mohammad, this is Matt Bashir from Boxdale High. 
 Is Tarek with you? 
 No, I'm on shift. 
 Do you know where he is? 
 No... What's wrong? 
 He left the school. 
 We're not sure where he is, but don't worry, I'll call you back. 
 (STAMMERS) 
 Kellie : The guy who you were living with before -- he hurt you. 
 That's why you hurt him, right? 
 Now, has anyone else ever hurt you or made you do anything that you didn't want to do? 
 Mr Bashir? 
 Karim? 
 Kenny, why were you letting Karim store his drugs in your locker? 
 We want to help you, Kenny. 
 We want to place you with a Somalian family. 
 Good people -- people that you can trust. 
 But you've got to tell us the truth about Karim. 
 He said he could help me. 
 How? 
 He said he can make me... safe. 
 And what else? 
 He gave me money, but if the police come, if they find out, they'll send me back to Somalia. 
 Did he say that? 
 He say I have meet him, or... 
 Is that why Karim was at school that night? Was he looking for you? 
 Kenny, did you kill Karim? 
 Did you see who did? 
 What did you see? 
 Bilic here. 
 Bilic, it's Norton. Where are you? 
 I'm on my way to hospital. My wife's going into labour. What is it? 
 I'm bringing Kenny Mavondo in to make a statement. 
 Why, what's going on? 
 It's OK, it's under control. 
 I'm sending a patrol car out to the Ahmad house. 
 We know who killed Karim. 
 Hey! 
 Tarek. Tarek. 
 Put it down. 
 You would shoot your own father? 
 Get out. 
 Are you crazy? 
 Tarek! 
 Get him out! 
 Tarek, please. He's concerned about you. 
 No. 
 Mohammad, tell him. 
 He misses Karim. 
 You didn't know him! 
 I didn't know him? 
 You're telling me I didn't know my own son?! 
 He was dealing drugs. 
 He was breaking the fast. 
 No! 
 Ask him. 
 Ask the coppers. 
 Why didn't you tell me? 
 Why didn't you come to me? 
 I couldn't. You wouldn't listen. 
 I tried to stop him... 
 And now Karim is dead! 
 Say it. 
 You wish it was me. 
 You knew he was in trouble and you said nothing! 
 He had no respect for Almi! 
 How can you say this? Karim loved his mother! 
 Then why did he do it? 
 Why did he give it away? 
 (CRIES) 
 It's all he had left of her. 
 (CAR APPROACHES) 
 It's beautiful. Thank you. 
 I just wanted her back. 
 (CAR SPEEDS AWAY) 
 Get it back. 
 What? 
 Almi's necklace. 
 What are you on about? 
 I want it back! 
 It's too late. 
 What the f*ck you mean it's too late? 
 It's gone. 
 What do you mean it's gone? 
 f*ck you! 
 (BOTH GROAN) 
 Give it back! 
 f*ck off! 
 (BOTH GROAN, GRUNT) 
 (GASPS) 
 (COUGHS) 
 (CRIES) 
 I didn't mean it. 
 You killed him. 
 It was an accident. 
 Oh, no, Tarek, please. 
 No, Tarek. Forgive him. 
 Forgive him. Think about your wife. 
 Think about the struggle that you had to get here. 
 You've already lost one son. You don't want to lose both. 
 Hmm? 
 (CRIES) 
 (GROANS) 
 (CRIES) 
 (CRIES) 
 (CRIES) 
 (SIGHS) 
 (PHONE RINGS) 
 Mum? 
 Just quickly because you're very busy. 
 How is the celebration? 
 Good. Looks like it's going well. 
 Make sure you offer the food around. 
 Now they will also see what a good cook you are. 
 Yes, Mum. 
 Hey, is Dad there? 
 Yes, of course he's here. 
 I'll get him for you. 
 No, no, no, no. Tell him... 
 Tell him I want to see him. 
 OK. Yes. I'll tell him. 
 When will you come, hmm? 
 I'll come tomorrow, OK? 
 OK. 
 Alright, bye. 
 Bye. 
 I assume you've heard about the grant. 
 Yeah. Well done. 
 Mmm! We're not dead in the water after all. 
 Doesn't look like it. 
 Is Dino here? 
 He's moving on. 
 Announced today he's standing for preselection. 
 You're kidding. 
 Uh-uh. 
 Perfect. 
 (ARABIC MUSIC) 
 Mr Bashir. 
 My wife. 
 Nice to meet you. 
 Farid. 
 Hi. 
 Hey. 
 Hey. 
 You proud of yourself? 
 You should be. 
 Yeah. 
 Proud of the boys. 
 Proud of everyone. 
 Didn't think it was going to be an easy ride, did you? 
 No. Of course not. 
 Farid. Here. 
 No. 
 I'm staying with my friends. 
 Great night, sir. 
 Yes, it is. 
 I brought you some decent food. 
 It's your favourite. 
 Lamb. 
 Good? 
 (DOORBELL RINGS) 
 Mrs Langworthy?
