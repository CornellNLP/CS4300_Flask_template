 Twenty years ago, when the corporations bailed out our failed governments, they sold it to us as salvation. Now we see that we have paid for that rescue with our freedoms. We have awakened to the truth. We have become slaves to the Corporate Congress. Today, all that changes. Let the word go forth from this time and place, to friend and foe alike, that we have passed the torch to a new generation unwilling to permit the undoing of human rights and dignities. And let every corporation know, whether it wishes us well or ill, that we shall pay any price in order to assure the survival and success of liberty. 
 (POUNDING ON DOOR) 
 CPS Cop 1 : Don't move! Hands where we can see them! 
 CPS Cop 2 : Stay where you are! 
 CPS leader : I got this, Kiera. Edouard Kagame, you're under arrest. Under section 76 of the Union Code, you are charged with being the leader of the terrorist group Liber8, and conspiring to plot against the Corporate Congress. 
 You're too late. 
 Oh, my God! 
 Greg : Liber8 murdered 30,000 people to kill 20. 
 Of course they deserve to be executed. 
 Separate their methods from their message. 
 Just for a second. 
 That'll never happen. 
 Forget it. 
 Oh, right. 
 Because they went too far. 
 So you do agree with them? 
 No, I understand them. 
 You understand bombing the Corporate Congress and killing people? 
 I understand wanting to return to democracy again versus a corporate dictatorship. 
 Come on, the government lost their relevance after they went belly up. 
 Oh, what? So we'd be dead or in the street if it wasn't for the corporate bailout? 
 And you wouldn't have that ivory tower to teach out of. 
 We've given up representation, free speech, assembly. We... 
 Seems like you're still free to speak your mind. 
 (BEEPING) 
 Sergei : Alerts on corporate. 
 CPS webs as well. 
 Something's up. 
 Sergei : A call to arms on the eve of the executions. 
 They're just trying to intimidate us. 
 Won't work. 
 After tomorrow, they'll all just be dead. 
 And we can move on with our lives. 
 Mom? 
 Are the bad guys attacking us again? 
 No. 
 The bad guys are in prison. 
 And pretty soon they'll never be able to hurt anyone ever again. 
 Do you have to go? 
 Yeah. 
 It's my job. 
 For me? 
 For tomorrow. 
 In case you need backup. 
 Thank you. 
 Greg : First execution in 40 years. 
 You should be proud you got the assignment. 
 Kiera : Thanks. 
 (INDISTINCT CHATTER OVER PA) 
 Dispatch : Perp check in your sector. 
 Please confirm ID. Hang on. Looks like you're up. This won't take long. You're a suspect in a crime. Maintain your position. (GRUNTS) (GROANS) CPS 8-11. Suspect recog. Uploading. Dispatch : That's a match. Tyler Killen. Property damage. Book and process. (GRUNTS) You've been tagged, Mr. Killen. Report to a CPS station for booking, or face the pain. Oh, and bring your little friend here with you. Hey, you two. You better clean up your acts, otherwise you're gonna be permanent visitors at this place. Hobbs : Take my advice. You want to leave this world with your dignity and your emotions intact. That is what your followers would want, and more importantly, that's what I want. Do we understand each other? We just received credible information that Liber8's plan is to attack the execution chamber itself. Back up Prison Security and stay alert. Change of plan, Kiera, you're with Elena and the Chamber. The rest of you with me. What do you think, Greg? Circus or justice? You don't believe everyone in the world needs to see this? I would have preferred something a little less public. But the surviving members of the board insisted. The board is right. We need to take an eye for an eye. Execute them as a deterrent. CPS sergeant : Curtis Chen. Jasmine  Garza. Lucas Ingram. Stefan Jaworski. Edouard Kagame. Matthew Kellog. Travis Berta. Sonya Valentine. Kiera? You have been convicted of crimes against the Union and sentenced to death. All appeals have been exhausted. (INAUDIBLE) There will be no commutation. (INAUDIBLE) Prisoners, take your positions on the table. What the hell? He's got something! Greg : Kiera! CPS, this is Cameron. CPS? Anyone? (SIREN WAILING) What the hell? Where am I? Man : Come on, man, let's go! Hey! CPS! Maintain your position! Ingram! (TIRES SCREECHING) Central. This is Cameron. I need backup. Who is this? CPS Officer Cameron. Respond one. I'm separated from my team. I need backup. Some weird sh1t is going down. CP... Look. This is an experimental encrypted frequency. How did you find this channel? What? Is this the same MIT hacker who's creeping my firewall? 'Cause if it is, lam so going to bust you! This is a security net, you idiot. You're in violation. Nice try. I don't care who you are or what you think, I need backup at this location. Now! Location? (BEEPING) Holy sh1t, it works. It shouldn't. This is impossible. (GROANING) (SIREN WAILING IN DISTANCE) Start talking. Not to you. You shot me up with Torox? Bitch. What happened back there, Lucas? Where are we? What did you guys do? Time jump. The vortex. You were there and now you're here. Where? Where is here? Same place we started. Place, not time. Space, not time. Get it? Where is the prison? Not where is the prison. Where the prison will be. Should have been six years, looks like 60. Would have been a sweet escape. How do we get back? How do I get home? You are home. (LAUGHS) What happens now? We become ghosts. We blend in and no one is going to find us. (LAUGHS) Watch me. Here you go! (SIREN WAILS) Rise up, brothers! Join the fight! Drop the weapon! Drop it! Hands on your head! You alone? Nope. I'm with her. Nice try. I can't lie. I'm on a drug. You don't say? A truth serum. I've never been in an automobile. This is your lucky day. One down, seven to go. Hello? I heard that. Look, I know you're still there. I was listening. One down, seven to go. I heard everything. My question is, how? I haven't even put the tech that you're talking on into circulation yet, so how the hell do you have it? (CAR HONKING) (WOMEN SNICKERING) Isn't somebody going to explain to me what just happened? Well, Lucas is the only one who can tell us but he's not here. What about Kagame? He didn't make it through. We'll be okay without him. Wow! Knock yourselves out! How can this be happening? Well, Mr. Buddy back there was talking about time jumping. Time traveler, hello? If I'm in the past,  how are you in my head? How are you on my computer? Who is this? (SIGHS) My name is Alec. Alec, what year is this? It's 2012. No! No, I have a son. He has to see the dentist tomorrow. We were going to go to the Lemurs concert this weekend. My anniversary is next month. It is not 2012. What year are you from? 2077. You are not from 2077! Why would I lie about that? Well, if that's true, then you are screwed. Mmm. A bone handle! (LAUGHS) Our division commander had one of these. Yeah, I never liked that guy. Nice shot. I missed. Where the hell am I? Corner of Pender and Beatty. How did you know that? Look, I don't know what's going on either, but there's no way you and I should even be talking to each other. Now, we're communicating on a next-gen liquid chip experimental frequency that's encrypted from my end. Liquid chip? Yeah, it's proprietary. You created this technology? Yes. You're Alec Sadler. You know me? None of this makes any sense. Okay, wait. Let's figure this out, okay? Meet me. No. You're going to need money. You're going to need a place to stay, right? That's the first thing you've said that does make sense. Good, then what I want you  to... (DISCONNECTS) Hello? Am I the only one to point out the obvious here? Listen, Travis. Even if we manage to make an impact in this time, there's still enough years between now and the revolution to turn it around. The revolution is on our schedule, Kellog. The war begins now. Now, about me. Hello? Get out of my head, Alec. You can't shut me out. I built the system we're talking on, remember? But I understand you think by telling me what I'll become, it'll create some sort of paradox whereby my knowing, it won't actually happen? But what you may not know is that there are two schools of quantum time travel theory. On the one hand, you've already changed the future by going back in time. The damage is done, you can't stop what's already been started. What's the other? That this journey is part of your own timeline from the future. That is to say that all these events have actually happened before, and you're simply going through the motions, again. Does that mean I'll get back to my time? If that's what happens, or happened. It's a little confusing, even for me. Or maybe you're just some expert hacker thief who stole all my research,  and this is some elaborate ruse. You're so pretty. What? Not cool. Turn it off, Alec. Is it Off? Yeah, it's off. (SIGHS) (STATIC) Whoa, whoa, whoa. Something just happened. I'm getting a lot of interference. Relax. It's probably my CMR. CMR? Cellular Memory Re view. I am outfitted with a CMR bio-upgrade. A memory pack is implanted into my skull and records telemetry,  video and audio to my cortex. It's to be used in chain of evidence in trials. So no one needs to testify. It's all recorded. Everything is on playback? I usually download everything to the CPS server at the end of the day. Kiera : (CHUCKLES) Very funny, mister! 
 
 You can have him back when you're done. Soy-moo, again? Kiera. See you after work, sweetheart. I'll meet you on the train. Kiera. Bye, Dad. How old is your son, Kiera? That's enough for tonight. sh1t. (SNIFFLES) Backup. God damn. (BEEPS) They catch an employee, they call him a rogue trader, they throw him in jail. My son is right. When the bank CEO does it, they bail him outwith our money. How is that justice? (PANTING) Sorry. Alec, did you sleep in the barn again last night? Yeah, sorry. Big project. No need to be sorry. This is my stepson, Alec. Why don't you join us? Um, maybe some other time. It was nice meeting you. All of you. Man : You too. Okay, uh... Long night. I think I'm gonna go grab a shower. Mmm-hmm. All right. He's not ready. Not yet. Reporter : Good evening. Police in Portland are trying to locate the shooter in a gangland slaying that took the lives of three men in a brazen evening attack last night. I have to say we're absolutely not surprised to find them here. Reporter : ...describe automatic gunfire from a black SUV as several patrons were leaving the restaurant. Police have not released the identity of the victims, but a spokesperson said the gunmen were known to police, and have ties to gang activity in the (REPORTER CONTINUES INDISTINCTLY) Can you believe this? What have you got? All signs point to an explosion. But there are no bomb fragments, no evidence of combustible material, no residue at all. How is that even possible? Yeah. Good question. Carlos : Do you recognize her? Not one of mine. Just give me a sec, huh? Excuse me. Can I help you? No, thank you. Uh, see, I don't think you understand. This is a crime scene, so I'm going to have to ask you to leave. You're law enforcement? Detective Carlos Fonnegra. Special Investigations Unit. So if you could just... You brought in a suspect last night. Male. 30's. Red jumpsuit. Probably intoxicated. We did. Are you suggesting he has something to do with this explosion? Yes. Did you bring in any other suspects last night? No, just the one you described. You saying he's part of a gang? A very dangerous one. There are six others headed somewhere this way. And I'm assuming at least one of them is injured. You know quite a bit about this incident. What agency are you with? I'm, uh... I think I'm going to get going. Hey, hey, whoa, whoa! Hey, come on. Anything you can add to help lighten my workload would be greatly appreciated, trust me. I'm sorry, I don't want to get in trouble. And this isn't my jurisdiction Okay, look, this character that we brought in last night, he's got no ID, he's not telling us his name. He doesn't show up in any print or DNA databases. A little help would be nice. His name is Lucas Ingram, and you won't find him in any database. See? What else you got? I've said too much already. Okay, come on. I think both of us know that you're a cop. I don't know why you're pretending not to be. Aren't we supposed to be on the same side? You know, helping each other out? Linda Williams, Detective. Portland PD, number 1272. Portland? You know, you showing up without approval could be quite the political hot potato. Ah. Don't sweat it. Nice to meet you, Detective Williams. What do you say I put you in a room with, uh... What's his name? Lucas Ingram. Then you can decide whether or not you want to help me. Thanks. Carlos : All right, follow me. Hey. Hey, Carlos. Well, you seem to have adjusted quickly. Where are the others? Probably doing things they shouldn't be. (DOOR OPENS) Answer the question, Ingram. Please, the adults are talking right now. (DOOR CLOSES) Detective, could you give us a minute? I think it might help. (DOOR CLOSES) Who fixed you up in the prison? What are you talking about? The device was smuggled in. You had someone on the inside. What difference does it make? You can't go back and file a report. (SCREAMS) How do you get back to 2077? You can't undo what's been done. We're here. We can't get back. You don't know that. Actually, before I joined the movement I was a SadTech engineer, so yes, I do. And let me be clear. This has always been a one-way ticket. Look, with the knowledge you have, why don't you just make some quick money on the stock market or sports, buy an island and just hide out when sh1t hits the fan? Stay out of our way and we'll leave you alone. Do you know who I am? You're a Protector. Yeah, a Protector. Just a nobody cop. You, you're somebody. And I bet with the right person and the proper means to look,  I could find out quite a bit about you. Is the right person me? Yes, I'm talking to you! What? It is me! Okay, sweet, what are we looking for? You were born Lucas Talbert. Talbert, got it. You took your mother's name, Ingram, when your father went to prison. She was... Oh, correction. She will be born in Victoria a few years from now to Kent and Mary-Lee Ingram. Mary-Lee Ingram, found her. 66 Beaconsfield Road. 66 Beaconsfield Road. It's on a cul-de-sac. Last house on the right. That's the price of being a famous terrorist. You wouldn't. Right before I buy that island. Wait! I'll tell you what I know. What did you say to him? We talked about his future. My boss wants a word. So this Ingram character is linked to gang activity in Portland? I just spent the better part of a decade crushing the local gangs, and I'll be damned if some Oregon start-ups are going to come up here and make camp in my backyard. You understand me, Detective? Yes, sir. Then enlighten me. My hunch is they are moving their territory north. They're part of a larger gang. West Coast-based. Started in Portland. They will expand rapidly by taking over other gang chapters and affiliates. Did you guys call in the Marines? Stay back, folks. You can expect well-coordinated and violent criminal activity. A ruthless disregard for the law and some unorthodox tactics. (GRUNTING) So you're an expert? Gang task force or something like that? Something like that. Who's your direct supervisor? Your lieutenant? My direct supervisor, sir? Who do you report to? I want to know who to thank for setting up a Portland-based operation in my precinct without my authorization. Still waiting, Detective. (PHONE RINGS) Yeah. Put him through. Walt. Woah, woah, woah, slow down. Son of a bitch. I have two officers down. Their cruiser was stripped of weapons and ammunition. Whatever you're talking about... It already started. They're following tactical protocols. Shelter, weapons, credits. Currency. Carlos : Money? That's their plan? We got a half a dozen bank alarms being triggered all through the city. Is this in their playbook? It's a diversion. What? There's only one bank being robbed. Dillon : And how the hell do you know that? Focus on the last alarm tripped. Why that one? Because they wouldn't move until they had cover. Go. (SIREN WAILING) (TIRES SCREECHING) Cavalry's on the way. I need you to stay back. Carlos, I need a weapon. No, what I need you to do is stay back and keep out of my way. Listen to me, with guys like these I need a weapon! Not a chance! So I guess a gun is still out of the question? I'm out. (GUN FIRING) You gotta be kidding me! (SIREN WAILING) (GUN FIRING) Man : Kellog, cover the exit. Kellog : I'm on it Flank her. Go for the head! Fry, bitch. Jaworski's down! Curtis : Damn it. Jaworski! Damn it! She's running! I got her, I got her! Flank her! She's got eyes on me! Sadler : Kiera, are you okay? Alec, listen, no matter what happens to me,  you have to tell people these guys are going to start a war! No one is going to believe me. There are things behind the vent in my hotel room. Things that should convince anyone you're telling the truth. Promise me, Alec. I will. I promise. Okay. Here we go. (GUN FIRES) (GROANS) You're not going anywhere. Are you hit? Let me go. Not a chance. We have you cornered! Friendlies! Cop : Clear! Are there any more of these guys outside? Just these three. We have to get back to the station. (PEOPLE CHATTERING) Oh, Jesus Christ. I need a medic. Inspector! I have six dead here, two in the alley. Lucas Ingram? They shot their way in here, they broke him out of holding. He's gone. Look, I need every cop I can get my hands on right now. You talk to your command. Given your expertise when it comes to this gang, I'm not letting you go. I'll handle it. Then handle it! Just know this means war. You know, you pulled some pretty crazy sh1t back there. I should thank you for saving my ass? Yes. Yes, you should. You know, what I can't figure is whether you just like playing hero, or if you're actually a little bit crazy. I know what this group is capable of. I've lost friends too. Thanks for everything today. Yeah. They didn't have to murder those officers like that. They're soldiers, starting a war that they already lost once. So that's why they were in prison. 'Cause they lost a war? They tried to assassinate the heads of the world's largest corporations, killing tens of thousands of innocents as collateral damage. So that's what they'll do now, just pick up where they left off? Not if I can help it. Um... You never told me what happens. To me. No, I didn't. I'm not sure that I should. I knew it. It's something bad, isn't it? Alec, I... Forget it. You're right. People just shouldn't know too much about where they're headed. Dad! Hey! There's my boy! Come here. Ooh! Well, you're probably very busy, we should go. No, nonsense. Introduce me. Sam, this is my boss. That's your building. Yes, and it's a pleasure to meet you, young man. Finally. And this is my wife, Kiera. Kiera. It's long overdue. I'm Alec Sadler. Narrator : Next time on Continuum... Five heavily armed gunmen don't just disappear for Christ's sakes. How do you even know you're gonna get us back to the right time? I made the calculations. The cover I created for you is not gonna hold up. Now is the part where you tell me what you're doing here. You don't even know what you're going back to. But I have to try. Where's the Protector? Who the hell are you?
