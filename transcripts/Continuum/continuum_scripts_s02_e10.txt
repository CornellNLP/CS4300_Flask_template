 Narrator :  Previously on  Continuum... 
 They have tattoos. 
 It's a series of dots between their fingers. 
 Who are "they?" 
 Escher :  You call them freelancers. 
 Kiera :  What do they want? 
 What everyone wants. Power. Control. I'll be running this squad under a separate mandate, a separate budget, and a new set of rules. It's time for the gloves to come off. Waking up in a fishery, it's 1992. So do you know what they do? They stick me in a nuthouse. Yes. Yes, of course. Kagame wants you to go. What if you could save tens of thousands of people? Even if it meant killing one person? I'm not gonna be whatever it is you say, okay? I'll be something different! I promise! People can change, I can change! You are too dangerous. Please, just don't kill me, okay, please? I beg of you, please! Thank you! Thank you! Kiera :  What if this is it? My pointing a gun at his head. . . This whole experience... What if I'm the one that creates the monster? Welcome home, Theseus. You say these people are my followers. Gather them. I have something to say. (DOOR OPENS) (DOOR CLOSES) We're locked down. How did you get in? Even in our final days, we're not without allies. You're preparing for eternity? I'm not a believer myself, but we all have been fighting for freedoms, including spiritual ones. I've done things. Made choices contrary to my beliefs. That's what soldiers do. Death may not be waiting for us. I thought you said you weren't a believer. Not in a higher power, but in a message. Our message. Kagame. The teachings of Theseus. What are you saying? Simply this, don't fear death. Each ending is merely a new beginning. Kiera :  2077. My time, my city, my family. When terrorists killed thousands of innocents, they were condemned to die. They had other plans. A time-travel device sent us all back 65 years. I want to get home, but I can't be sure what I will return to if history is changed. Their plan, to corrupt and control the present in order to win the future. What they didn't plan on was me. I've got Arc searching for all members of Liber8. What about Gardiner? He's gone radio silent. Well, if Gardiner left his house in the last 24 hours we would have something. Cell phone ping, facial recognition, bank use... I've had nothing on him in the last week. Arc isn't some magic trick. It relies on real time data, which means things need to be happening in real time, not yesterday and not tomorrow. What? Julian needs to be added to the watch list. Okay, fine. Added. Alec, what happened in the woods is done. Julian's moving on. Past Liber8, past his own actions. And, if he keeps his word, so will I. You really went somewhere. I'm not sure I know who you are. I didn't hurt him. (SCOFFS) You were ready to. But I didn't. That's who I am. Well, thank God, Carlos could get through to you, 'cause I couldn't. You did. In your own way. (BEEPING) What's that? It's Garza. What? I've been trying to find a location on her ever since she grabbed me. Arc just got a facial recog hit on her 90 seconds ago. Where? I'm getting the coordinates now. Carlos. I'm... I'm sensing reluctance. You're as sharp as your suit. Then let me put you at ease. You can start by telling me how this is all going to blow up in my face, because you're involved, Kellog, so I know it will. Looking into Escher is in our mutual interest. If I'm right about his intentions... I'm more concerned about your intentions. Hey, you okay, buddy? Yeah... Yeah, fine. Uh... Escher. You were saying? Kellog : You have resources, I don't. You need to think about your future, Lucas. I do, but why should I put them at your disposal? (COMPUTER BEEPING) Apartment 24, 93.5% probability. Kiera : Thanks, Alec. I had him cross-reference every tenant in the building to draw a probability of association with Liber8 or the Syndicate. He came up with a 93.5% probability for the person in apartment 24. 93.5% probability. That's the best he can do? (CHUCKLES) ERT units are on their way, we should wait. Look, we can either stand around and talk about catching Garza, or actually do it. By the time ERT gets here, she'll be on the wind. (GUN COCKING) (KNOCK ON DOOR) I thought you came alone? I did. (KNOCK ON DOOR) Police! Open up, Garza! (GUN FIRING) No, wait, watch this. (GRUNTING) Gotcha. She looks calm. That'll change. I feel like it's my birthday. You wanna unwrap your present? Go get a coffee. You take it. You have history, use it. And this one is off the record. No cameras, no recordings. Get me what I need. Understood. You're okay with this? Taking down Liber8? That's why I'm here. That's not what I'm talking about. Dillon just gave you a free pass to use any tactic necessary. And I intend to use it. He doesn't have the authority to do that! Nobody does! Dillon gets it. Maybe you need to. Kiera. This isn't 2077, all right? There are rules and consequences. You wanted to shoot Julian! I can only imagine what you would justify doing to Garza. Why leave it up to your imagination when you can see it for yourself? (GRUNTING) Travis's location, his objectives, his personnel. I want all of it. Try a little harder, this feels more like foreplay. (GRUNTING) Ow! You're sexy when you're worked up. Take off these cuffs, we can both enjoy this. Fine. Play it smug. But I will break you. Count on it. How's Alec? Kiera :  Not relevant. Jasmine :  Really? Must piss you off that I know him better than you,  both versions, young and old, his secrets, his plans... His interests. (GROANS) New rules. Alec Sadler's office, 2077. Explain. He told me about the message he put in your head about your purpose. What is my purpose? Tell me! Make me! (GROANING) Make me, come on! Kiera! Ease up! What're you doing? What're you doing? It's the military chip they put in her head, it makes her  loco,  you better watch that. (GRUNTS) Maybe you need to wake up, start thinking for yourself, huh? This kind of tactic gets us nowhere. Or maybe it got me exactly what I wanted. She's all yours. Alec, are you there? I wouldn't miss this! I think Garza just accidentally gave me a way to locate Travis. How? She said my CMR was military. Is it? No. But she thinks it is because that's what she knows from Travis. He must have had a military CMR implanted when he was in the Super Soldier program. Now, I'm guessing they deactivated it  when he went to prison. But... Maybe we can remotely activate it the same way we triggered Elena's? Exactly. And then we can find his location! Can you do that? Uh, let's give it a shot. Okay, I've got a general area. Gastown. All right, keep working on the signal. I need an exact location. (ELEVATOR BELL DINGS) You okay? You were supposed to locate Garza. Why haven't you? Normally they would be holding her downtown at one of the precincts. But the cops ain't acting like cops anymore. No. They're acting like a private army. Find out which precinct has added security. That's where she'll be. I'll look into it personally. Make sure you do. 'Cause I take failure personally. Your plans for world domination still on track? Yep. What are they, anyhow? Like, does this have anything to do with it? This is Arc. It's a way to take the entire Internet and distill it into one single page of information. It's the ultimate window into real time data at light speed. So I can download music really fast? All the music ever recorded, at your fingertips, instantly. No download required. Now replace the word "music" with anything your heart desires. I think I just got it. You're brilliant. And my heart desires you. Which reminds me... What's this? You said you lost your phone, so I got you a new one. Thank you. Kiera :  Alec? Are you there? I got to go to school, anyhow. Good thing I'm not the jealous type. Okay, here goes nothing. (GROANS) Get up! (GROANING) Sadler :  Kiera, I think I've got him! I got a general location. I'm sending you the coordinates now. Any way we can make that more precise? I'm working on it. Okay, you're within 50 meters, he should be up ahead! Kiera : Hold on, there's something I need to check first. (CROWD CLAMORING) (CHANTING)  Restore and rebel. Restore and rebel. (CLAMORING) The corporation destroying this low-income housing is the same one that makes you pay for the privilege of holding your money, then gambles it and your pensions, on bad real estate deals. (CROWD BOOING) if we let these corporations have their way here it's only a matter of time... Kiera, they're the body-snatchers! Woman :  if the politicians won't stop this greed... Yeah. Freelancers. What're you gonna do? Woman :  ...to take a stand for fairness and justice. Lure them into a trap and find out who they are. People, not profits! (GROANING) Oh! Oh, my God, Alec, what's happening? In order to narrow down Travis' CMR signal, I had to send out a pulse. (BEEPING) Travis :  What's that? I didn't say anything. Kiera :  Who was that? Alec? Protector. Protector! Holy sh1t! Who is that? How did this turn into a conference call? Somehow your CMR just linked to Travis'. Shut it down, Alec, now! Shut it down! Uh-oh. That was Travis Verta in my head. Yeah, I guess activating his CMR did more than just locate him. Whatever you do, don't reconnect it! If we were linked, he may now be able to track me! Or worse, track you! (BOTH GRUNTING) (PEOPLE CLAMORING) sh1t! sh1t, sh1t! Kiera? Crowd : (CHANTING) People, not profits! People, not profits! People, not profits! Friends! Friends! (CROWD BOOING) Man : Terrorist! (CHANTING) Terrorist! Terrorist! Terrorist! Yes. Yes, from some points of view, you could say I'm a terrorist. I instill fear, terror into those that want me silenced, the ones that want all of you silenced! So, if fighting for you, the ones who can't fight for themselves, makes me a terrorist, then I guess that's exactly what I am. But same with George Washington and Nelson Mandela, Geronimo! Any kid who picks up a stone and throws it at a tank advancing on his village! But, friends, hear me. The true terrorists here are the financial institutions and corporations who seem to be above the law that is there to protect us as citizens! (WHISTLE BLOWING) Form a line! Do not let these men through! Rebel! Rebel! Rebel! Crowd : (CHANTING) Rebel, rebel, rebel... Alec? Alec? Crowd : Rebel, rebel, rebel... (CHANTING CONTINUES) (WHISTLE BLOWS) (ALL CLAMORING) Get the suit, he's a cop, he's a cop, get him! This way! (SIREN BLARES) Crowd : Rebel, rebel, rebel... (SIREN BLARING) So, Kiera told me that you let Alec Sadler go. Just makes me think. Maybe you're not beyond saving. I know what Sadler means to you. To the rest of Liber8. She told you? Yeah. I know all about you, how you got here. Blow your mind, huh? (SCOFFS) So, you bangin' her? (CHUCKLES) Are you bangin' Travis? Every chance. Well, then I'm guessing he's probably gonna want to find you. He's gonna put surveillance on all the precincts, eventually he's gonna figure out that this is the one you're being held at, and then we'll be ready for him. So, you have to decide. Do you want Travis to live? Because he's "shoot to kill" in this brave, new world of ours. There's nothing brave about a police state. One day you'll realize that. By then, it'll be too late. I gave him the phone that you prepared for me. Good work. What else? Arc. It's the master key to all digital information, real time access to any database. Secure, private. It doesn't matter. Interesting. Now, did you see anything else in the lab? Technology that, um, well, at first glance might appear difficult to comprehend? What is it, Emily? I need you to pull me out. I have done everything you've asked. I've provided protection. I've kept tabs on everything he's doing, it's just that... It's just that... You have feelings for him? Yes. But that's not the point. He's a good man, and I think he's doing the right thing, and I don't believe that we're. . . Emily? I don't pay you to think. You don't pay me to be a zombie, either! Fair enough. I'm just saying I assumed you wanted someone who was 100% committed in this situation. He loves you. I believe he does. And you love him. So who could be more committed? You'll stay on the contract. Now, what I need you to do is break up his routine. Get him out of the lab tonight. Take him for a dinner out. Why? Because I asked you to. I've made reservations, it's on me. Is this about getting him out of his lab? Are you gonna do something? Emily, I am always doing something. Right now, what I'm doing is protecting Alec. And, by extension, you. 
 
 (PEOPLE TALKING INDISTINCTLY) Alec? Alec, are you there? Hey. I saw what you did out there. We could use more people around here with your passion. Thanks. Here, have some water. I'm Rebecca. You? I'm uh... Theseus : Kiera... Her name is Kiera. Everybody! Meet one of my father's killers. So. Changed your mind about letting me live, huh? I didn't know you were here. You know, in the woods there was a moment where you were ready to kill me. I could see it in your eyes, why? Doesn't matter. It matters to me. You're alive. That's all you need to know. What about the future? You said this all had something to do with Kagame... You said you knew what I was going to become. Talked about all the people I would kill, I mean, in the thousands. As if it had already happened. Kagame and Sonya used the exact same point of reference, the future is set, my destiny with it. It's not set. Other people's words telling you what to do? What do you believe? (DOOR OPENS) We need to finish this now. Not in here. Alec? Anything? She just wants to talk politics. Every second she stalls, Travis gets further away. Carlos : Yeah. Martinez! Yeah. You. Garza. You know what to do. You got it. What? This doesn't feel right. You have a better idea? That woman in there would kill you without a second thought if given the chance. And you're worried about a little roughhousing? No. I'm worried about where this goes. And frankly, sir, I'm worried about you. Well, I appreciate your concern, Detective. But I don't need your worry. What I need is for you to get off that fence you're sitting on and start doing your job. She's part of the system that wants to destroy you, and this movement! You think I don't know that? Then you know what needs to be done. She could have killed me in the forest. She didn't. Don't lose your nerve just because she did. You want to be a leader? Then lead. It's time. We got confirmation on the precinct where they're holding Garza. She's at Stadium. What're you gonna do? You're gonna waltz in there and get her? If I know Garza, she's just gonna waltz right out. (DOOR OPENS) (DOOR CLOSES) I'm worried about our friend. It might undermine his ability to lead effectively if this unusual behavior was to get around. Make sure that it does. (PEOPLE CHEERING) Today, my friends, we took to the streets and let the corporations know that we would not stand for their corruption any longer! (PEOPLE CHEERING) Now, instead of listening to us, they seem to have sent us a message in the form of an assassin. (ALL BOOING) Shh... Message received. They say if you live by the sword, you should be prepared to die by it. This is her sword. (GUN COCKS) Are you ready to die by your sword? You cannot make a man listen with a bullet. No, it takes words. Ideas. Enlightenment comes through education. They can try to take away our liberties, but they cannot destroy our ideas! Untie her. Theseus. Untie her. Now. You're free to go. (GUN CLICKS) You still think I'm a monster? Are you breaking up with me? What? No! (SIGHS) Why would I bring you here? I don't know, show me a good time in a public place so I don't cause a scene? You're a romantic. And a pessimist, apparently. I have no intention of breaking up with you. Then what are we doing here? (SIGHS) Oh, God, you are breaking up with me. No! I just wanted to get you away from... Get you to myself. Yeah? I need to say that there's something you don't know about me. I haven't told you that... I... Emily, it's okay. I love you, too. Hello, fresh meat. I guess this makes you "bad cop." If that works for you. (GRUNTING) (GROANING) Hey, can I use your phone? So good. Oh. Excuse me, can we have the check when you have a chance? Your meal has been taken care of. Nobody's supposed to know we're here. We should go. If I could just have a moment of your time... You're Alec Sadler. Yeah, and you are... Escher. Pleased to meet you. Emily. Look, let me just tell you why I picked a dinner, and I'll leave the two of you alone. I have a question. I hope I have the answer. Don't worry, you do. What do you want, Alec? What do I want? You mean what's my price? No. How do you want to live? More importantly, how do you want to be remembered? I thought you were going to pitch me. Offer me triple what Kellog's paying me. Well, I could do exactly that if that's what you want. But I'm guessing it's not. I'm wagering that you see past the transience of wealth, that you are looking for something. Something more fulfilling. A legacy. I think I can help you get it. But I would have to abandon Kellog. For a start, yes. Think about it. Yeah, I would have to. That would be the smart play, but please don't take too long. The longer you wait, the more difficult it will be to get what you want. Emily, pleasure to meet you. Please take care of him. I will. Excuse the interruption. Have a great evening. Sadler : That was weird, sorry. Emily : It's fine. (PHONE VIBRATING) (SIGHS) Emily : Kiera? Yeah. Take care of it. I'll be okay. You sure? Yeah. Okay. (SIGHS) What was that in there? Insurance. Where is he? He got called back to the lab. You don't want to challenge me, Emily. I don't know what you mean. I mean, you went along with my introduction back there. Now, how do you think Alec will feel when he finds out that you work for me? When I ask you for information, I expect you to leave nothing out. I understand. I'll try harder. Well, then I'll ask you the question again, now that you understand the stakes. What else in that lab might be of interest to me? Nothing. Get back to work. Hey, it's me. Hey, where the hell have you been? I've been trying to get a hold of you. It's kind of a crazy story. Look, I have a location where Julian and his crew are hiding out. I'm going to text you the information. Okay, I'll get eyes on it. (PANTING) Got to go. Gun! Get back! Get back! Take it easy, Garza. Get back! Take it easy. I'm going into this elevator. If I see a cop when I get out, I shoot, no hesitation. (ELEVATOR BELL DINGS) Call downstairs, get the exit sealed! Mobilize ERT. You, you, you! Come with me. Carlos? (GRUNTS) You haven't thought this through. We've hit this building before. I know it inside out. (PHONE BEEPS) (ELEVATOR BELL DINGS) (GUNSHOT) Go, go, go, go! Wow. Uh, what does that mean? (SIGHS) It means I got to do a full reset. It's like they drained your batteries completely. I'm going to need to surge you in order to recharge them, so once I turn them back on there's going to be a burst of power flowing through your CMR. I'm sorry, but it might hurt a little bit. Great. This is the main one right here? On the right, yep. All right, what am I looking at? It's the elevator shaft. We've got units making their way down already. At the base of it is an engineering access tunnel. The same developer built this entire block. The tunnels lead to several adjacent buildings. I got to get back down there. Let's get units dispatched to all those buildings. (BEEPS) You ready? Ready as I'll ever be. Here we go. (BEEPING) (GROANING) (GROANING) Garza! (GRUNTING) (GRUNTS) (SIRENS WAILING) Some of this tech is similar to yours, but these other components, I have no idea what they are. They shut my system down too easily. Whatever they have, I need to know how to counter it. They're from the future, aren't they? Like even more future than you. What do you think they want? I don't know. And not knowing makes me vulnerable. And that's not my only blind spot. The message you sent to yourself. Did it contain any information that you didn't tell me? No, why? Garza said something about my purpose. Did she say anything about it to you? Kiera, I wouldn't hide anything from you, you should know that by now. Yeah, I do. I'm sorry. To be honest, I would be lost here without you. (HUFFS) You wouldn't be here without me! I owe you, remember? No, it's not that. You're my friend. And with everything that's going on, I don't want to lose sight of that. (PHONE VIBRATING) It's Carlos. Hey, you're up awfully late. Oh. You can't drug away the truth. You're not real. The protector killed you. You sure about that? Did you see the body? Or do you only believe what people tell you? Leave me alone. Sonya told you Travis was killed. Kellog said he could be trusted. All lies. Your instincts knew, yet you did nothing. What do your instincts tell you now, Lucas? That I'm going insane. Or maybe for the first time in your life you're seeing the truth. Even if what you're saying is true, what am I supposed to do now? I'm not sure. But there's one who does know. Are you ready to be enlightened, brother? Hey. Uh, checked out that address for Julian, the place was empty. What happened here? Garza happened. She killed Martinez. Carlos, I'm sorry. I underestimated her. We underestimated her. But I think I know how to find Travis, and she will be with him. You don't understand. Garza didn't escape. What are you talking about? Security cameras from the building next door caught her being carried into a sedan by the two you ID'd as body-snatchers. Warren and Miller. How do these guys operate? What do they operate from? Why are they collecting people like you? I don't know. Yeah, well, maybe you should find out. Sorry... You said that you can track Travis? I think so. Good. Maybe we can get to him before they do. Travis : I will find you, Garza. Are you there, Cameron? The city can only get smaller, protector. How do you know this will work? I don't. No one does. But either way, this life will end and a new life will begin. You'll either know it, or you won't. It's that simple. Thank you, Travis, for giving me something I thought I had lost. Hope? No, the knowledge that my fight is not over. I am still a soldier. This was here when I arrived. Now I understand what it means. What does it say? "Your brothers await you in the next life." "Do not seek them, they will find you." "Trust in that."
