 Narrator : Previously on Continuum. 
 Nice shot. 
 I missed. 
 I'm not going. 
 One goes, we all go, Kellog. 
 I'm establishing a task force to take on this new threat. 
 We could really use someone with a deep understanding of its methods and tactics, Special Agent. 
 She's using you. 
 I'm missing a piece. 
 CPS cop : You two, get inside! 
 Kiera : Terrorists. 
 Explains the heavy backup. 
 I've got a bad feeling about this. 
 CPS cop : Second landing clear. 
 (BABY CRYING) 
 CPS leader : Cameron, give me a scan. 
 The room's shielded. 
 I got nothing on thermal or tactical. 
 CPS leader : Okay, people, remember, this guy is ex-military and part of the Bio-Enhancement program. 
 So expect a heavyweight with some major aggression. 
 These juiced soldiers end up turning into terrorists. 
 It's the shots, makes them big and strong. 
 Also makes them crazy. 
 CPS leader : Cut the chatter, people. 
 Go. Three... 
 (BEEPING) 
 Go! Go! Stay down! 
 Stay down! 
 Stay down! 
 Stay down! 
 CPS cop : Follow me through. 
 Kiera : One Tango, unarmed. 
 Help. Help. 
 CPS cop 1 : All clear. 
 CPS cop 2 : Clear. 
 We've got another one, south wall. 
 (GRUNTING) 
 Holy sh1t. 
 Dispatch, this is tac-5. 
 We just bagged a Liber8 face, I repeat, we got the Queen of hearts. 
 Dispatch : Roger that. 
 Dillon : All right, folks, let's settle down. 
 Special Agent Cameron, you have the floor. 
 Thank you, sir. 
 Intel on terror group is scarce. 
 But I will do my best to bring you all up to speed. 
 Travis Verta, ex-special forces, tactician, well-trained in hand-to-hand combat. 
 He is most likely calling the shots and should never be approached without backup. 
 We all know Lucas Ingram. 
 He is the reason this precinct was targeted. 
 He's a high value member, bomb maker, engineer, technical expert. 
 He's clever, but he's arrogant. 
 Curtis Chen. 
 Another former soldier with aggression issues. 
 He likes to intimidate and demonstrates psychotic tendencies. 
 Jasmine Garza, weapons, vehicles. 
 That's a lot of ex-military. 
 Should we be consulting the Department of Defense on this? 
 We are in talks. 
 But since they all joined Liber8... 
 Hold on. Liber8? 
 That's their name? 
 Kiera : Yes. 
 Since they all joined after leaving the services, this is now a police matter. 
 Moving on. 
 We do not have an image for Matthew Kellog. 
 Con artist, social engineer, facilitator. 
 If his lips are moving, he's probably lying. 
 Which brings me to Edouard Kagame. 
 He's the leader of this cell and possibly the most dangerous. 
 He hasn't been spotted with the others since they arrived, but if he is here, he's just keeping a low profile. 
 Finally, Sonya Valentine, Queen of hearts. 
 Partner of Travis, former doctor in the military Special Operations Division. 
 She's got an IQ that's off the charts. 
 More likely to use guile or subterfuge than physical violence to achieve the gang's ends, but keep your eyes on her if she crosses your path. 
 Sonya : Cute, really cute. 
 (MOANING) 
 (SLOW MUSIC PLAYING) 
 No. 
 Huh? 
 I got something much better for you. 
 You're gonna love this. 
 Yeah, what's that? 
 (WHIRRING) 
 (ZAPPING) 
 Kiera : 2077, my time, my city, my family. 
 When terrorists killed thousands of innocents, they were condemned to die. 
 They had other plans. (EXPLOSION) A time-travel device sent us all back 65 years. I want to get home, but I can't be sure what I will return to if history is changed. Their plan, to corrupt and control the present in order to win the future. What they didn't plan on was me. (HEART MONITOR BEEPING) You're gonna be okay. He needs a medic. What about Sonya? A medic from this era. With access to real drugs. Sign me up for that. (CHUCKLES) I don't think you appreciate the delicate situation that we're in. Yeah, you mean Travis? I mean us. If something happens to Travis, this group is gonna turn inside out. And we both know who's gonna be pushing for Alpha. Curtis? After Travis, Sonya is most senior. Yeah. Well, why don't you tell that to Curtis? Hey! Where are you going? I don't want to be here if Travis flat lines. You feel me? Kiera : This makes no sense. You realize this is a ridiculous amount of packaging for a very small device. I mean, I mean, no wonder you have an excess trash problem. (CHUCKLES) Okay, take it out of the box. Okay, I don't understand. Hold on a second. Explain it to me now. Okay, well, I imagine the people in the coffee shop are looking at you because you're talking to yourself, right? Yeah, I thought so. Put it in your ear. And there you go, you've gone from complete crazy person to legit yuppie all in one move. Do you really want all this blood on your hands? What do you want? Two eggs scrambled, sausage, biscuit and hash browns, please. And tomatoes, if they're fresh. Coffee, black. Same thing for my friend, thank you. God, I'm starving, aren't you? I meant, why are you here? I want to talk. That's it. Then I better like what you have to say. So get on with it. I want to protect my future, and you want to protect yours. My comrades and I are from two very different viewpoints on the use of force. Would you believe me if I told you that I don't share their methods? No. Neither did the judge. I admit, what happened was beyond forgiveness. It's ironic coming from a man with a live grenade in his hand. Why are you telling me this? Why should I care? 'Cause I can give you something you want. An arrangement for our mutual survival. You scratch my back, and where my former associates are concerned, I'll cover yours. What's in it for you? I like it here. I like the lifestyle, you know. I like the variety and availability of meats and other goodies. I know it's all going to change, but I'll probably be dead by then. Do what you want with the others. I don't care. I just want to live out my life in this time. We're both survivors, Officer. We're never going to be allies, but it may happen that from time to time we both want the same thing. I'm looking for situations that are win-win. Oh, the local constabulary, time for me to go. I'll be in touch. Please don't, uh, try to follow me. Damn, I was really hungry. Oh, sorry. Excuse me. No, please. Hey! Ready for the thing? Huh? Uh... Hello? You Okay? Yeah, yeah. That's a nice Bluetooth. Oh. Thanks. I was kidding... Hey, Clayton. Hey. Uh, can't do it. Kiera Cameron, uh... Hi, uh, hi. New partner. Nice to meet you. Carlos : This him? Clayton : Yes. Greg Doolin, 45. Someone bored a hole into the back of his head about the width of a golf ball. Cored his skull like an apple. (CARLOS CLEARS THROAT) They removed a section of the lower cortex, right where it meets with the spine. Yeah, exactly. Desanguination indicates the victim was still alive when the cut was made. The precision of the removal suggests highly advanced surgical skill. The wound appears to be cauterized. Uh, yeah, like I said, she's new. And she's right. Um, an instrument that could make a cut with that kind of precision doesn't exist. Are you a medical professional? No, I just have a hunch our killer may be. Ah. So, are we done with this one? As you can see, the hits just keep on coming. You think this could be a member of our gang, the, uh“. What's her name, uh, Sonya, the medic? Well, this could be any one of them. But if medical skill is required, she's the one providing it. How long do you keep the dead? Weeks, sometimes months if they go unclaimed. Is Jaworski still here? Uh, yeah. The body is evidence in our investigation. Can you take me to him, please? How much longer? The network security of this decade is a complete joke. Well, can you get it, quickly? Somewhere, a medical supplies warehouse is accepting payment from a financial institution that 40 years from now will epitomize everything we're fighting against. So that's a yes? A Baker August 5000, hospital grade. Where do you want it delivered? Any house on the street. We can intercept. Kiera : What was done to him? His organs were weighed and examined as part of the autopsy. Just following standard protocol. Why? Did you find something you didn't expect? Uh, yes. In fact, there were some structural abnormalities in his heart, lungs and CNS. How did you know? That's not up for discussion. Until you hear from me, you need to secure all evidence you have relating to this man and consider it classified. Classified? Kiera : Yes. I'll arrange to have it shipped to a safe location. She's our expert on this gang. Do what she says. Okay, understood. All right, thanks. Talk to you soon. (STAMMERING) Did you want to see the other body? What other body? Clayton : Meet Brian Young. Came in yesterday. This changes things. Uh-huh, it sure does. Pattern killing, ritualistic mutilation. (SIGHS) Mr. Young yesterday and Mr. Doolin today. I took the liberty of cross-referencing both victims through all the crime databases. Came up with nothing. So there's no apparent connection between the victims. If that holds up, we could be dealing with a serial killer. There is one connection. Yeah, what's that? What's missing. We need to find out what exactly is being extracted from our victims. Talk to the M.E. In both cases the pituitary gland was extracted while the victim was alive. Alive? As best as we can guess from the physiology of the wounds. What does it do, this gland? It's an endocrine gland that produces many hormones, but my guess is your suspect was after human growth hormone. They're harvesting it. Excuse me? Harvesting? That's my guess also. Believe it or not, this stuff has value on the black market. Really? For who? How much? Athletes mostly. Coaches. And it's expensive. Was there any reason that these two men in particular were targeted for the harvesting? Anything linking them chemically? Not that I can see. Blood type is different. I'll need to run some more lab tests to be sure, but it could take weeks if I don't know what to look for. We don't have weeks. I need to know what to look for. Let's go. Yeah, okay. Look, just run any tests that come to mind and call me if you find anything. All right, what's next? Find the connection between our victims that no one has noticed yet. Kiera : Nothing? (SIGHS) No. No common friends, no business interests, two completely different worlds. There's nothing, in any database linking the two vics. Maybe my contacts can help? Your people with the answers nobody else seems to know. (CLEARS THROAT) I need a database search. It doesn't work that way. What? You didn't dial anyone. Told ya. I need a search. Oh, my God, you're really missing the point of this thing. Okay, it's coming right up. (BUZZING) Uh... I have to call you right back. Hey, Julian. Hey, your mom asked me to come and get you-  Everyone's here- Okay then. Alec? Yeah, I'm coming. Come on, dude, everyone's here. Let's go. Kiera : Uh... Hello? Hello? It's nice to know even the government drops calls. Just wait till the phone company is the government. Ooh... That's a scary thought. As long as we are dependent to the corporations for their food-growing technologies, we become slaves to those who would use technology to enslave us. And the forces that control our lives are counting on that same fascination with technology. They know. They know. They market it to us. (CONTINUES INDISTINCTLY) How is he? Alive. Unlike some people around here. Is that supposed to be some kind of a threat? Yeah. What was Kellog on about? Kellog has always been different. He's up to something. He's always breaking ranks on us. Sneaking out on his own. What do you suggest? What would you do if you were in my shoes? Take him out. And violate our oath we swore to each other? Before he has a chance to make a play. I'm just thinking about you, Travis. Do you mind if I... Just for a sec, real quick. Thank you. Ingram : What are you doing? What are you up to, Kellog? You know that lady Protector that came back with us? What about her? I'm setting that bitch up. Mom? I'm Just gonna head back out to the barn to work. Okay. Wait, wait, Mom, here. Let me help you with that. Oh. Thank you, sweetheart. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay. Mom, why are you always in here alone cleaning up after people? It's no bother. I'm happy to. Why can't Roland, or Julian do it? It's their group. Don't tell me they converted you too. (CHUCKLES) Honey. I realize that it's asking a lot of you to listen to your stepfather and his beliefs, okay? But that is all I'm asking you to do, is just listen. Nobody is expecting you to change the way you live, or stop your work. He's so full of crap. He has his beliefs, honey, as we all do. If you want him to respect yours, then you have to respect his, right? There's a very good man in there who is trying to reach out to you. (SIGHS) Okay, well... I'll really try hard, Mom. For you. (CHUCKLES) I don't understand how you find anything with this antiquated system. Well, we can't all have unlimited budgets like some people, or there'd be no inter-agency jealousy. Sadler : Okay, I'm back. Excellent What's excellent? The work you're doing. What are you talking about? I've got nothing. Sperm? Sperm? Sperm? I'm sending it now. They both were paid a couple hundred bucks by the same fertility clinic. It's a sperm bank south of downtown. South Creek Fertility Services. Huh. How'd you come up with that? Look! They're both listed as receiving payment. Sperm. Are you Dr. Gibson? We need a word. Detective Fonnegra, VPD. You'll have to schedule an appointment with my secretary. This will just take a second. Look, we need access to your client database. Absolutely not, those records are confidential. Now, if you'll excuse me... 
 
 Kiera : Alec? Dr. Ted Gibson, I'm on it. All right. You are gonna love this. Carlos : I understand where you are coming from, but I've got two bodies in the morgue with holes drilled into the back of their skulls. The only connection between the two of them is you. If you're suggesting I had anything to do with any murders, you should be talking to my lawyers. We're not suggesting you had anything to do with the murders. If you'll just give us a second, we'll explain. Let me explain to you. I'm not the kind of man who appreciates being accosted by police officers who seem to have forgotten a little right called doctor-patient confidentiality. That didn't seem to bother you in 2002, Seattle, I believe it was when you released the names of your "premium" donors to some of your patients and then charged extra for their services. How much does the sperm from a Nobel Prize runner-up go for these days? That case was settled. The records are sealed. How did you find out about that? She has her sources. Okay. Thanks. Hey. Like what you're doing with your hair. Carlos : Great. So? Well, the records are on the way. What's the point? Well, if the killer used the clinic database to find his victims, there should be a link to their records. Which means that hopefully we'll be able to identify the next victim before another murder. Good. I'm looking for Detective Fonnegra. Yeah, right here. Uh, we've got the files from the fertility clinic. That was fast. Are they on a jump drive or on CDs? We've got 45 of these babies down in the truck. Where do you want them? Forty-five of these babies! (LAUGHING) (SIGHS) These files don't indicate any commonalities between the two victims. (YAWNING) What are you looking for? We need to isolate their matching genetic marker. Sadler : All right, give me a sec. Hey, here we go. Both men have an identical chromosome that's tied to pituitary mutation. Both victims have an identical chromosome that's tied to pituitary mutation. It's dormant here, but the kind of thing that could be triggered. What is that? And how do you even know about it? With the right equipment, this natural hormone can be synthesized into a powerful metabolic drug. What, like a steroid? Yeah, like a super steroid. The kind of thing that the military might use to build a better soldier. So these guys need this steroid? Have you checked for a military program with a profile that matches this one? Not yet. Okay. Let's get on it. Yeah. Okay, so our perps are searching the fertility clinic database for clients with this marker? Which means we're going to have to check the rest of these files for that same genetic marker. (SCOFFS) And we should look into any highly sophisticated medical equipment that's been stolen in the past week. Why's that? Human growth hormone needs to be synthesized into a serum in order for it to be effective. How soon can we start work? Give me 20 minutes. You can have five. (CLEARS THROAT) Sadler : Come on! Boy : Idiot. How am I an idiot? You're an  idiot. You're an idiot. You  suck! Oh, whatever, man. You're going down. Oh, come on! Oh, yeah right. I'm done. Sadler : No, I'm not talking to you. You know, you can go a lot faster than that. Oh, forgot, you don't want Studley Do-Right to know what you're doing. Fine, but just know that I've calculated at this rate, it's going to take at least seven more hours  to get the info in. Just saying. Okay, you win. Huh? Win What? Take two folders. Open them side by side. Next. You understand this genetic crap? Yeah, sort of. Next. Wait, I have a match. HEY, you got a match! How'd you even see that? I have a knack for patterns. Next. Next. What are you doing, Kellog? I'm just, uh, minding my own business. Give that to me. Why an address? It's nothing. It's... (STUTTERS) What? It's nothing. I don't believe you. You know as well as I do that Travis may not make it. Now, if someone were to do something, you know, make some kind of statement by action that impressed the others, well, it would go a long way to putting them in a position to take over, eh? (CHUCKLES) You're not making any sense. Well, if someone brought back the head of the Protector on a platter, that would register. That would make an impact. It wouldn't be that difficult. All you'd need to know is where to go. An address. Give me that. (GRUNTS) Are you going to shoot me, Kellog? Give me that. That's what I thought. I can give you more information down at the station. Try and make an ID from some photographs of anyone suspicious who may have been following you. Yeah. Okay, thanks. Did we get them all? Uh, no. No, Herbert George did not answer. All right. Well, then we're gonna have to pay Mr. George a visit. Is there an address? Yeah. Faber College. He's a student. (CARLOS SIGHS) I had a couple of friends who went here. What about yourself? What about me? Did you go to college? Oh, yeah. John Jay for law enforcement. Police work's all I ever wanted to do. Me, too. Yeah? Where'd you go? Union Military. Class of... (CLEARS THROAT) Almost had you. No. Not even close. Pretty close. And that's as close as you're going to get. Uh-huh. We'll see about that. Hold on. Fonnegra. Okay. Okay, great, thanks. Herbert George, registered in room 316. Also works in the campus kitchen. Which I think is pretty close from here... Um... Rock, paper, scissors. Follow what Carlos does and on three, make a fist. On three. Ready? One, two, three! Damn it. I'll take the kitchen. Call me if you find him. Kiera : What did we just do? I'm sorry, did I just teach you something that you didn't already know? Alec? Sorry. That was just me, savoring the moment. Continue, please. Hello? (KNOCKS ON DOOR) Herbert George? You're like the third person looking for him. I keep telling people. There's no Herbert here. My old roommate dropped out in the first quarter. Other bed's been empty ever since. Herbert George. (PHONE RINGS) Yeah? Carlos! I just checked his room. There is no Herbert George. This is a set up! Kiera, slow down. Kellog : Just take it easy. Curtis : Shut up. Police! Freeze! Put your weapon down. Carlos... Carlos : Do  it  now! I said drop it, asshole! No, I don't think so! Where's the bitch? I'm going to let you two guys figure this out. Now, move! (CLICKING) (GRUNTS) (YELLS) (GRUNTS) sh1t! (GRUNTING) (YELLING) (GRUNTING) This is going to be easy. You just don't give up, do you, sweetheart? You just don't either, sweetheart. (G ROANS IN PAIN) (GRUNTING) (SCREAMS) It's over. You want to go home? You're going home. You got it backwards. Carlos! Carlos. You're going to be okay, Carlos. (RING TONE) (HEART MONITOR BEEPING) (MOANING) (INHALES SHARPLY) (COUGHS) (DOOR OPENS) Travis! Good to see you back on your feet. What happened to you? (CHUCKLES) Curtis happened. Travis : Go on. I was going to take out the cop, right. I had her set up and sitting pretty and then Curtis muscles in on the plan. Tried to take me out. What were you two thinking? We were trying to impress the others in case... In case you didn't make it. Well, I'm not impressed. And now we're five! I'm here to make it right. Oh, my God, you've been tagged! Tagged? What? You got a homing beacon in your bloodstream. Burn it! Now! Cop shot me, I didn't know what it was! (GRUNTS) You may have led the Protector right back to us! I didn't know what it was. What should we do? I know what to do. DILLON; Kiera? Yes? You were about to walk us through the events? Of course. Uh, Carlos... Detective Fonnegra and myself, we traced the next potential victim to this address... What she's trying to say is that it was over before she got here. You can read about it in my report, sir, but the bottom line is that Curtis Chen, one of the Liber8 killers, is off the board, permanently. A good day's work by any definition. Special Agent Cameron here made the connection to the clinic that allowed us to get him. And they won't be targeting anyone else. I may have finished the job, but, uh, she definitely deserves the credit. Dillon : Well, nice work. I look forward to reading that report. Thank you. Yeah. I'm guessing the last thing you need right now is the scrutiny that comes along with an officer involved in a fatality. Let me take the heat on this one. I mean, it's the least I can do. (CHUCKLES) I do have one last question. Maybe later you can tell me what actually happened here. Maybe. I got a few things to clear up first. (CHUCKLES) Yeah. Some things, okay. Well, why don't you take care of them, and see you back at the station. Kiera : Damn it. Alec, where are you? Living large. What can I do for you? My suit is damaged. What? Well, I wouldn't even know where to begin What did you do to it? (SIGHS) That's not the point. My suit was short-circuited. And I really need it. I tagged Kellog with a transdermal location dart. It stays in his bloodstream for 24 hours. I need to track it, but I can't call anything up on the suit. Give me the frequencies. I'll see what I can do. Hi. Comfortable? My friends weren't very understanding when I came back here tagged. Hmm. I scanned the perimeter. No sign of the others, no ambush. What's going on? They left me here to keep you busy while they move to a new place. Herbert George Wells. H.G. Wells. Both : The Time Machine. A classic. I thought you'd appreciate the reference. I don't appreciate how you almost got me killed. I delivered Curtis like room service. Room service doesn't shoot back. I never said it was gonna be easy. So what now? We're both adults. The house is empty... (CHUCKLES) Or not. You could arrest me I suppose, but I can't help you from a prison cell. You can't hurt me from one either. I have no intention of hurting you. Quite the opposite. Untie me. Give me one good reason. Look, I know how these animals think. I can help you protect innocent people who might get in their way. That's your job, isn't it? You are a terrorist and a revolutionary. What? No, no. That guy won't be born till 2041. I'm a guy with a bad future, ready for a fresh start. What do you got to lose? You mess with me now and I will not only kill you in this time, but I will make it my mission to guarantee that you are never born in the future. We clear? Absolutely. (BEEPING) What's happening? We got her. We got the Queen of hearts. CPS leader : Tag and ship this waste of space. (BEEPING) Run! (PANTING) How can you be so sure the gang won't still need victims for their serum? Kellog told me they synthesized enough to last indefinitely. Can you trust him? Probably not. But the fact that his own gang just tried to blow him up makes me feel a little better about the situation. Wait. What are you doing? You could get into trouble. It's only a matter of time before those two bodies in the morgue start raising questions. If I'm ever going to get home, the last thing I need is a trail that leads here. A girl's gotta have secrets.
