 EXT. SPACE 
 The TARDIS hurtles through space. 
 INT. TARDIS 
 ROSE : What's the emergency? 
 THE DOCTOR : It's mauve. 
 Rose and the Doctor rush around the console, as the TARDIS shudders and shakes. 
 ROSE : Mauve? 
 THE DOCTOR : The universally recognized colour for danger. 
 ROSE : What happened to red? 
 THE DOCTOR : That's just humans. By everyone else's standards, red's camp. Oh, the misunderstandings. All those red alerts, all that dancing. 
 He gestures to the object they are following through the Time Vortex on the monitor. 
 THE DOCTOR : It's got a very basic flight computer - I've hacked in, slaved the TARDIS. Where it goes, we go. 
 ROSE : And how safe is it? 
 THE DOCTOR : Totally. 
 Part of the console explodes. 
 THE DOCTOR (CONT'D) 
 Okay, reasonably. Should have said reasonably there. 
 EXT. TIME VORTEX 
 The object hurtles through the Vortex. 
 INT. TARDIS 
 THE DOCTOR : Oh, no, no, no, no, no! It's jumping time tracks, getting away from us. 
 ROSE : What exactly is this thing? 
 THE DOCTOR : No idea. 
 ROSE : And why are we chasing it? 
 THE DOCTOR : It's mauve and dangerous. And about 30 seconds from the centre of London. 
 EXT. SPACE 
 The object hurtles towards Earth, with the TARDIS in hot pursuit. 
 OPENING CREDITS 
 EXT. LONDON ALLEYWAY 
 The TARDIS materializes behind some bleak looking houses in London. Rose exits, followed by the Doctor. 
 THE DOCTOR : Do you know how long we can knock around space without having to bump into Earth? 
 ROSE : Five days? Or is that just when we're out of milk? 
 THE DOCTOR : Of all the species in all the universe and it has to come out of a cow. 
 There is a sudden distorted view of something over head as though something is watching them. They walk away from the TARDIS. 
 THE DOCTOR : Must have come down somewhere quite close. Within a mile, anyway. And it can't have been more than a few weeks ago. Maybe a month. 
 ROSE : A month?! We were right behind it! 
 THE DOCTOR : It was jumping time tracks all over the place, we're bound to be a little bit out. Do you wanna drive? 
 ROSE : Yeah... how much is "a little"? 
 THE DOCTOR : A bit. 
 The distorted vision still observes them. 
 ROSE : Is that EXACTLY a bit? 
 THE DOCTOR : Ish. 
 ROSE : What's the plan, then? Are you gonna do a scan for alien tech or something? 
 THE DOCTOR : Rose, it hit the middle of London with a very loud bang. I'm gonna ask. 
 He shows Rose his psychic paper. 
 ROSE   (reading it):  Doctor John Smith, Ministry of Astroids. 
 THE DOCTOR : Psychic Paper, tells you... 
 ROSE : Whatever you want it to tell me, I remember. 
 THE DOCTOR : Sorry. 
 ROSE : Not very Spock, is it? Just asking? 
 She is watching the Doctor trying to get through a door. 
 THE DOCTOR : Door, music, people. What d'you think? 
 ROSE : I think you should do a scan for alien tech. 
 The Doctor holds his sonic screwdriver to the door. 
 ROSE (CONT'D) : Gimme some Spock! For once, would it kill ya? 
 THE DOCTOR : Are you sure about that t-shirt? 
 Rose is wearing a garish Union Jack t-shirt. Rose looks down at it. 
 ROSE : Too early to say. I'm taking it out for a spin. 
 The Doctor continues trying to open the lock with his sonic screwdriver. Rose turns around as she hears an eerie voice. 
 THE CHILD : Muuuu-mmy? 
 Rose looks around for the source of the voice. 
 THE CHILD (CONT'D) : Muuuu-mmy? 
 The Doctor cracks the lock. 
 THE DOCTOR : Come on if you're coming. Won't take a minute. 
 He goes through the door. Rose does not follow him, but continues looking around for the child. 
 THE CHILD : Muuuuumy? 
 Rose finally spots the child standing on a roof-top. 
 ROSE   (urgently) : Doctor? Doctor? There's a kid up there! 
 But the Doctor is already inside. Rose runs to try and find a way onto the roof, watched by the child. 
 INT. DARKENED CORRIDOR 
 The Doctor, follows the sound of the voices and music and a waiter. 
 INT. DRINKING DEN 
 The Doctor finds himself in a crowded drinking den, full of smoke and chatter and a singer. 
 NIGHTCLUB SINGER: "  For nobody else gave me the thrill, when I have found I love you still, it had to be you, wonderful you... " 
 EXT. LONDON ALLEYWAY 
 Rose runs up to the building on top of which the child stands. 
 ROSE   (shouting to him):  Are you all right up there? 
 THE CHILD : Muuuuum-my? 
 Rose runs up the steps that go up the side of the building. 
 INT. DRINKING DEN 
 NIGHTCLUB SINGER : "  It had to be you ". 
 She finishes the song. The audience applaud. The Doctor joins the applause as he approaches the stage. 
 THE DOCTOR : Excuse me! Excuse me!  (Into microphone).  Could I have everybody's attention just for a mo? Be very quick, eh... hello!  (Waves cheerily).  Eh... might seem like a stupid question, but has anything fallen from the sky recently? 
 Complete silence. The Doctor looks around expectantly. Then, the audience starts to laugh. The Doctor stares around at them all, confusedly. 
 EXT. LONDON ALLEYWAY 
 Rose finishes climbing the steps, but they do not go all the way to the roof-top. The child is standing precariously on the edge. 
 THE CHILD : Mummy? 
 ROSE : Okay, hold on! Don't move! 
 The child looks down at her. Suddenly, a rope swings into sight, going up the side of the building seemingly to the rooftop. Rose takes hold of it. 
 INT. DRINKING DEN 
 The audience is still laughing, and the Doctor is still looking around at them all. 
 THE DOCTOR : Sorry, have I said something funny? 
 The audience laughs still some more. 
 THE DOCTOR (CONT'D) : It's just, there's this thing I need to find, would've fallen from the sky a couple of days ago. 
 A siren sounds. Immediately, the people start to evacuate the room. 
 THE DOCTOR (CONT'D) : Would've landed quite near here... 
 The Doctor looks up at the ceiling, in the direction from which the sirens seem to be coming. 
 THE DOCTOR (CONT'D) : With a very loud... 
 Through the crowds of people all clamouring to leave the building, the Doctor notices a poster tacked to the wall, bearing the legend "Hitler will send no warning". 
 THE DOCTOR (CONT'D) : Bang... 
 He closes his eyes in despair. 
 INT. LONDON ALLEYWAY 
 Rose is now climbing the rope. 
 THE CHILD : Mummy... 
 Rose puffs and pants as she heaves her body up the rope. 
 THE CHILD (CONT'D) : Balloon! 
 The rope comes away from the side of the building, Rose still hanging onto it. She looks up, and sees that the rope is in fact hanging down from a barrage balloon. 
 EXT. SKY 
 The barrage balloon drifts away, Rose high in the air. 
 ROSE   (terrified) : Doctor! Doctor! Doctor! 
 She turns around and sees the German planes dropping bombs on London. 
 ROSE (CONT'D) : Okay... maybe not this t-shirt. 
 The planes zoom around her. 
 INT. LONDON ALLEYWAY 
 The Doctor emerges from the drinking den. 
 THE DOCTOR : Rose! 
 He rounds a corner to where the TARDIS is parked. A cat is sitting on top a dustbin. The Doctor turns around and notices it when it meows. He picks it up. 
 THE DOCTOR (CONT'D)   (to the cat) : You know... one day. Just one day, maybe... I'm gonna meet someone who gets the whole 'don't wander off' thing. 
 He shakes his head. Behind him, the TARDIS phone starts to ring. Brow furrowed, the Doctor puts the cat down, walks over to the TARDIS and opens the compartment behind which the phone is hidden. He stares at it. 
 THE DOCTOR (CONT'D) : How can you be ringing? What's that about? Ringing?  (Takes his sonic screwdriver out).  What am I supposed to do with a ringing phone? 
 A girl, Nancy, has silently come up behind him. 
 NANCY : Don't answer it. It's not for you. 
 The Doctor turns towards her questioningly. 
 THE DOCTOR : And how do you know that? 
 NANCY : 'Cos I do. And I'm tellin' ya, don't answer it. 
 THE DOCTOR : Well, if you know so much, tell me this, how can it be ringing?  (Turns back to the phone).  It's not even a real phone. It's not connected ,  it's not... 
 He turns back and Nancy has disappeared. The Doctor pauses, confused, then looks back at the phone. He hesitantly picks it up and holds it to his ear. 
 THE DOCTOR (CONT'D) : Hello?  (Silence aside from crackling).  This is the Doctor speaking.  (More crackling).  How may I help you? 
 THE CHILD   (on phone) : Mummy? 
 The Doctor's skeptical grin fades from his face. 
 THE CHILD : Mummy? 
 THE DOCTOR : Who is this? Who's speaking? 
 THE CHILD : Are you my mummy? 
 THE DOCTOR   (forcefully) : Who is this? 
 THE CHILD : Mummy? 
 Silence. 
 THE DOCTOR : How did you RING here? This isn't a real phone, it's not wired up to anything, it's... 
 THE CHILD : Mummy? 
 The line goes dead. The Doctor slowly replaces this phone in its cradle. He pokes his head inside the TARDIS. 
 THE DOCTOR : Rose? Rose, are you in there? 
 There is a crashing sound from behind him. Closing the phone compartment, the Doctor runs to follow the sound. He hurries out of the alleyway, and into a street. 
 EXT. GARDEN 
 MRS LLOYD : The planes are coming. Can't you hear them? Into the shelter. None of your nonsense, now MOVE it! 
 Following the sound of the voices, the Doctor stands on top of a dustbin to look over a garden wall. A fat woman is ushering a small boy into a shelter. 
 MRS LLOYD (CONT'D) : Come on, come on, get in there.  (Turns).  Arthur! Arthur! Will you hurry up? Didn't you hear the sirens? 
 A fat man emerges from the house. 
 MR LLOYD : Middle of dinner, every night. Bloomin' Germans.  (Yells skywards).  Don't you eat? 
 The Doctor smiles. 
 MRS LLOYD : I can hear the planes! 
 MR LLYOD :  Don't you eat?! 
 MRS LLOYD : Oh, keep your voice down, will ya? There's an air raid! 
 She pushes him into the shelter, and follows him down there. 
 MRS LLOYD : Get in... there's a war on. 
 MR LLOYD : I know there is... 
 Once they are inside, door closed, Nancy creeps out from behind the shelter and into the back door of the house, unaware that she is being watched by the Doctor. 
 INT. KITCHEN 
 Nancy enters the kitchen where there is an unfinished meal on the table. Looking around, she puts her bag down and opens a cupboard. She begins to take some tins out. 
 EXT. SKY 
 Rose is suspended hundreds of feet above London, carried by the rope hanging down from the barrage balloon. She cries out as the planes whiz past her, holding on for dear life. 
 EXT. BALCONY 
 A uniformed man, Captain Jack Harkness, peers up at Rose through binoculars of an advanced technological design. 
 OFFICER : Get those lights out please! 
 The soldiers begin to clear the room. 
 OFFICER (CONT'D) : Come on, down to the shelter. 
 A soldier called Algy approaches Jack, who is still watching Rose through the binoculars. 
 ALGY : Jack? Are you going down to the shelter? Only, I've got to go off on some silly guard duty.  (Spots Rose).  Ah! Barrage Balloon, eh? Must've come loose. Happens now and then. Don't you RAF boys use them for target practice? 
 Jack zooms in on Rose's bum. 
 JACK : Excellent bottom. 
 ALGY : I say, old man. There's a time and a place. Look, you should really be off. 
 Jack turns to face him. 
 JACK : Sorry, old man.  (Laughs, goes inside).  I've gotta go and meet a girl. But you've got an excellent bottom too. 
 He slaps Algy's bottom on the way out to emphasise this point. Algy looks rather pleased. 
 INT. KITCHEN 
 Nancy stuffs some things she sees around the kitchen into a bag and leaves the room. 
 INT. HALLWAY 
 Looking into another room, she smiles and goes outside. 
 EXT. STREET 
 She whistles as though calling someone, and then goes back inside. 
 INT. DINING ROOM 
 She takes her coat off and stands next to a table where a full meal has been abandoned. Some children hurry inside. 
 NANCY : Many kids out there? 
 JIM : Eh... yes, miss. 
 The two boys run to the table and make for the food. 
 NANCY : Ah, still carving. Sit and wait. 
 The boys do as they are told. 
 NANCY (CONT'D) : We've got the whole air raid. 
 She carves the meat. 
 JIM : Look at that. Bet it's off the black market. 
 NANCY : That's enough. 
 But she smiles. 
 EXT. SKY 
 The planes whizz past Rose, who is still hanging onto the rope. There is an explosion right below her, and she cannot hold on for any longer. She loses her grip and falls, screaming. Suddenly, a blue beam shoots out from somewhere near Big Ben, and Jack's voice emits from the source. 
 JACK : Okay, okay, I've got you. 
 ROSE   (scared and surprised) : Who's got me? Who's got me, and you know... how? 
 JACK : I'm just programming your descent pattern. Keep as still as you can and keep your hands and feet inside the light field. 
 ROSE : Descent pattern? 
 JACK : Oh, and could you switch off your cellphone? 
 Rose makes disbelieving noises. 
 JACK : No, seriously, it interferes with my instrument. 
 ROSE   (fumbling for her phone):  You know, no-one ever believes that. 
 She turns it off. 
 JACK : Thank you. That's much better. 
 ROSE   (slightly hysterical) : Oh, yeah, that's a real load off, that is. I'm hanging in the sky in the middle of a German air raid with the Union Jack across my chest, but hey! My mobile phone's off! 
 Jack laughs. 
 JACK : Be with you in a moment. 
 INT. JACK'S COCKPIT 
 COMPUTER : The mobile communication device indicates non-contemporaneous life form. 
 JACK : She's not from around here, no. 
 EXT. SKY 
 JACK :  Ready for you. Hold tight! 
 ROSE : To what?! 
 JACK : Fair point. 
 Rose zooms feet first down the tunnel of blue light, screaming. 
 INT. JACK'S COCKPIT 
 The next moment, Rose is caught by Jack. 
 JACK : I've got you! 
 Rose coughs. 
 JACK : You're fine, you're just fine. The tractor beam, it can scramble your head just a little. 
 Rose suddenly seems to notice how remarkably good-looking he is. She stares at him. 
 ROSE   (breathless) : Hello. 
 JACK   (raising his eyebrows and looking her up and down):  Hello. 
 ROSE   (still gazing at him) : Hello. 
 Jack raises his eyebrows and nods. 
 ROSE (CONT'D) : Sorry, that was hello twice there. Dull, but you know, thorough. 
 JACK : Are you all right? 
 ROSE : Fine! 
 Jack sets Rose back on her feet. Rose grins at him. 
 ROSE (CONT'D) : Why, are you expecting me to faint or something? 
 JACK : Well, you do look a little dizzy... 
 ROSE : What about you? You're not even focused... Oh boll... 
 Jack laughs. Rose's eyes roll back into her head and she faints into his arms. Jack, still smiling, lifts her onto a bed. 
 EXT. STREET 
 Some more children run down the road into the house where Nancy is serving dinner. They are watched by the masked child. One boy kneels down to tie his shoelace. The child takes a few steps forward, just as the boy finishes tying his shoelace and runs inside the house. The masked child advances towards the door. 
 INT. DINING ROOM 
 There are now several children gathered around the table, waiting for their meal. Nancy cuts the meat. 
 ERNIE : It's got to be black market. He couldn't get all this on coupons. 
 NANCY   (severely):  Ernie, how many times? We are guests in this house. We will not make comments of that kind. Washing up. 
 The other children laugh at Ernie. 
 ERNIE : Oh, Nancy! 
 Nancy looks at one of the boys sat around the table. 
 NANCY : Haven't seen  you  at one of these before. 
 ALF   (nods at another boy) : He told me about it. 
 NANCY : Sleeping rough? 
 ALF : Yes, miss. 
 NANCY : All right then.  (Passes plate around).  One slice each, and I want to see everyone chewing properly. 
 JIM : Thank ya, miss! 
 ERNIE : Thanks, miss! 
 ALF : Thank you miss. 
 THE DOCTOR : Thanks, miss! 
 Gasping in surprise, the children jump backwards. 
 NANCY : It's all right! Everybody stay where you are! 
 Jim stares at the Doctor in shock, a piece of meat hanging out of his mouth. 
 THE DOCTOR : Good here, innit? Who's got the salt? 
 NANCY : Back in your seats! He shouldn't be here either. 
 The Doctor smiles and helps himself to some sauce. 
 THE DOCTOR : So, you lot... what's the story? 
 ERNIE : What d'you mean? 
 THE DOCTOR : You're homeless, right? Living rough? 
 JIM : Why d'you wanna know that? Are you a copper? 
 THE DOCTOR : Of course I'm not a copper. What's a copper gonna do with you lot anyway? Arrest you for starving? 
 The children laugh, and the ice is broken. 
 THE DOCTOR : I make it 1941, you lot shouldn't be in London. You should've been evacuated to the country by now. 
 ALF : I was evacuated. They sent me to a farm. 
 THE DOCTOR : So why'd you come back? 
 ALF : There was a man there... 
 JIM : Yeah, same with Ernie. Two homes ago. 
 ERNIE : Shut up. It's better on the streets anyway. Better food. 
 JIM : Yeah. Nancy always gets the best food for us. 
 The Doctor smiles at Nancy. 
 THE DOCTOR : So, that's what you do is it, Nancy? 
 NANCY : What is? 
 THE DOCTOR : As soon as the sirens go, you find a big fat family meal, still warm on the table with everyone down in the air raid shelter and, bingo! Feeding frenzy for the homeless kids of London Town. Puddings for all! As long as the bombs don't get you. 
 NANCY : Something wrong with that? 
 THE DOCTOR : Wrong with it? It's BRILLIANT .  I'm not sure if it's Marxism in action or a West End musical. 
 The children look confused. 
 NANCY : Why'd you follow me? What d'you want? 
 THE DOCTOR : I want to know how a phone that isn't a phone gets a phone call. You seem to be the one to ask. 
 NANCY : I did you a favour. I told you not to answer it, that's all I'm telling ya. 
 THE DOCTOR : Great, thanks. And I wanna find a blonde in a Union Jack. I mean a specific one, I didn't just wake up this morning with a craving. 
 The children laugh. Nancy, however, does not look impressed. She stands up. 
 THE DOCTOR (CONT'D) : Anybody seen a girl like that? 
 Nancy takes his plate away. 
 THE DOCTOR (CONT'D)   (indignantly) : What've I done wrong? 
 NANCY : You took two slices. 
 The children laugh at him. 
 NANCY (CONT'D) : No blondes, no flags. Anything else before you leave? 
 THE DOCTOR : Yeah, there is actually. Thanks for asking. Something I've been looking for, would've fallen from the sky about a month ago, but not a bomb.  (Takes a notebook from his pocket).  Not the usual kind anyway. Wouldn't have exploded. Would've just buried itself in the ground somewhere, and it would've looked something like...  (Sketches).  This. 
 He shows them a scribbled drawing. Nancy looks at it intently but says nothing. There is a knock on the window. The children gasp. 
 THE CHILD : Mummy? Are you in there, mummy? 
 The Doctor goes to the window and pulls the curtain aside. The child with the gasmask on his face is standing there, knocking. 
 THE CHILD (CONT'D) : Mummy? 
 NANCY   (urgently):  Who was the last one in? 
 ERNIE   (gesturing the Doctor):  Him. 
 NANCY : Nah, he came round the back. Who came in the front? 
 ALF   (whispers) : Me. 
 NANCY : Did you close the door? 
 ALF : I... 
 NANCY : Did you close the door? 
 THE CHILD : Mummy? Mummy? 
 His shadow looms outside the front door. 
 THE CHILD (CONT'D) : Muuuuum-my? 
 INT. HALLWAY 
 Nancy rushes down the hallway and shuts and bolts the door before the child can get in. She backs away, looking at the shadow of the child outside the door, terrified. The Doctor stands behind her. 
 THE DOCTOR   (watching the shadow concernedly) : What's this, then? It's never easy being the only child left out in the cold, you know. 
 NANCY : I suppose you'd know. 
 THE DOCTOR : I do actually, yes. 
 He smiles pleasantly at her. 
 NANCY : It's not exactly a child. 
 THE CHILD : Muuum-my? 
 Nancy pushes past the Doctor and goes back into the dining room. 
 INT. DINING ROOM 
 Nancy addresses the children still sitting around the table. 
 NANCY : Right, everybody out, across the back garden and under the fence. 
 They just look at her. 
 NANCY (CONT'D) : Now! Go! Move! 
 They all jump out of their seats and run out of the door while Nancy puts her coat on, apart from one little girl. 
 NANCY (CONT'D) : Come on, baby. You've got to go. Okay? It's just like a game. Just like chasing. 
 The little girl jumps out of her seat. 
 NANCY (CONT'D) : Take your coat, go on. 
 The little girl runs after the other children. 
 NANCY (CONT'D) : Go! 
 INT. HALLWAY 
 The Doctor watches them pass, slightly confused. 
 THE CHILD : Mummy? 
 The Doctor takes a few steps towards the door. 
 THE CHILD (CONT'D) : Please let me in, mummy. 
 He sticks his hand through the letterbox. He has a scar on the back of his perfectly ordinary little hand. 
 THE CHILD (CONT'D) : Please let me in, mummy. 
 THE DOCTOR : Are you all right? 
 THE CHILD : Please let me in. 
 Nancy suddenly throws something against the door, which smashes. The child withdraws his hand. 
 NANCY : You mustn't let him touch ya! 
 THE DOCTOR : What happens if he touches me? 
 NANCY : He'll make you like him. 
 THE DOCTOR : And what's he like? 
 NANCY   (steps away):  I've gotta go. 
 THE DOCTOR : Nancy, what's he like? 
 They look at each other. 
 NANCY   (after a pause):  He's empty. 
 The phone rings. The Doctor looks at it. 
 NANCY (CONT'D) : It's him. He can make phones ring, he can. Just like with that police box you saw. 
 The Doctor looks at the shadow of the child outside the door, then picks up the phone. 
 THE CHILD   (on the phone) : Are you my mummy? 
 Nancy snatches the phone off the Doctor and slams it back down. The radio turns itself on. It plays music, but with the child's voice over it. 
 THE CHILD   (on radio) : Mummy? Please let me in, mummy. 
 The Doctor turns the tuner. He stops when a toy monkey suddenly springs to life. 
 THE CHILD   (through monkey) : Mummy? Muuum-my, muum-my... 
 The Doctor picks up the monkey and looks at it. 
 NANCY : Stay if you want to. 
 She leaves. 
 THE CHILD   (through monkey) : Mummy, mummy, mummy... 
 The child sticks his hand through the letterbox again. 
 THE CHILD : Mummy? Let me in please, mummy... 
 The Doctor kneels in front of the door, looking at the scarred little hand with a look of concern on his face. 
 THE CHILD (CONT'D) : PLEASE let me in. 
 THE DOCTOR : Your mummy isn't here. 
 THE CHILD   (after a pause):  Are you my mummy? 
 THE DOCTOR : No mummies here. None be here but us chickens. 
 He looks behind him at the deserted house, then back at the door, grinning. 
 THE DOCTOR (CONT'D) : Well, THIS chicken. 
 THE CHILD : I'm scared. 
 THE DOCTOR : Why are those other child frightened of you? 
 THE CHILD : Please let me in, mummy. I'm scared of the bombs. 
 The Doctor thinks for a moment. 
 THE DOCTOR : Okay. I'm opening the door now. 
 The child withdraws his hand from the letterbox. The Doctor draws back the bolts and opens the door, but the child has disappeared. 
 EXT. STREET 
 The Doctor walks down the path and looks up and down the street, but there is no sign of the child. 
 INT. JACK'S COCKPIT 
 Rose wakes up and gets up off the bed. She looks around at her surroundings. 
 JACK : Better now? 
 ROSE : You got lights in here? 
 Jack, who is sitting in the pilot seat, obligingly turns them on. 
 JACK : Hello. 
 ROSE : Hello. 
 JACK   (smiling) : Hello. 
 ROSE   (also smiling):  Let's not start that again. 
 Jack laughs. 
 JACK : Okay. 
 Rose pulls down her t-shirt self-consciously and takes a few steps towards him. 
 ROSE : So, um... who're you supposed to be, then? 
 JACK : Captain Jack Harkness. 133 Squadron Royal Airforce - American Volunteer. 
 He hands her what would appear to be an ID card. Rose looks at it. 
 ROSE : Liar. 
 Jack pauses. 
 ROSE (CONT'D) : This is psychic paper. It tells me whatever you want it to tell me. 
 JACK   (sitting back, caught out):  How do you know? 
 ROSE : Two things. One, I have a friend who uses this all the time. 
 JACK : Ah. 
 ROSE : And two, you just handed me a piece of paper telling me you're single and you work out. 
 Jack leans forward to take it back. 
 JACK : Tricky things, psychic paper. 
 ROSE : Yeah, can't let your mind wander when you're handing it over. 
 She hands it back to him. Jack reads it. 
 JACK : Oh, you "sort of" have a boyfriend called Mickey Smith but you consider yourself to be footloose and fancy free. 
 ROSE   (laughing, embarrassed):  Wha... 
 JACK : Actually, the word you use is "available". 
 ROSE   (grinning):  No way... 
 JACK : And another one, "very". 
 ROSE   (standing):  Shall we uh... try and get along WITHOUT the psychic paper? 
 JACK   (also standing):  That would be better, wouldn't it? 
 ROSE : Nice spaceship. 
 JACK : Gets me around. 
 ROSE   (running a hand along the ceiling)  : Very... Spock. 
 She looks at him for a sign of recognition. 
 JACK : Who? 
 ROSE : Guessing you're not a local boy, then. 
 JACK   (looking at his wrist device):  A cell phone, a liquid crystal watch, and fabrics that won't be around for at least another two decades... guessing you're not a local girl. 
 Rose is now sitting on the pilots seat, examining the spaceship. 
 ROSE : Guessing right. 
 She tries to touch something, but withdraws her hands quickly, gasping with pain. Her hands have burn marks on them. 
 JACK : Burn your hands on the rope? 
 ROSE : Yeah.  (Looking out of the window).  We're parked in midair! Can't anyone down there see us? 
 JACK : No. Can I have a look at your hands for a moment? 
 Rose sits back down. 
 ROSE : Why? 
 JACK : Please? 
 He sits next her. Rose holds her hands out and he runs a scanner over them. 
 JACK : You can stop acting now. I know exactly who you are. I can spot a Time Agent a mile away. 
 ROSE : Time Agent? 
 JACK : I've been expecting one of you guys to show up. Though, not, I must say, by barrage balloon. Do you often travel that way? 
 ROSE   (smiling):  Sometimes I get swept off my feet. By balloons. 
 Jack takes his scarf off and wraps it around Rose's wrists. 
 ROSE : What're you doing? 
 JACK : Try to keep still. 
 He finishes binding her hands and leans over her to switch a button over her head. They catch each other's eye, very aware of their proximity. There is a bleeping sound, what look like tiny golden fireflies appear above the wounds on her hands. 
 JACK (CONT'D) : Nanogenes. Sub-atomic robots. The air in here's full of them. 
 Rose looks pleasantly amazed as the nanogenes work their magic on the burns on her hands. Jack switches the button again, and they disappear. 
 JACK (CONT'D) : They just repaired three layers of your skin. 
 He takes the scarf off her wrists. 
 ROSE : Well, tell them thanks! 
 She laughs. Jack gets up, smiling. 
 JACK : We'll get down to business. 
 ROSE : Business? 
 Jack is now holding a bottle of champagne. 
 JACK : Shall we have a drink on the balcony? 
 Holding her gaze, he presses a button and steps to the roof lower themselves into the spaceship. Jack starts to go up the stairs. 
 JACK (CONT'D) : Bring up the glasses. 
 EXT. OUTSIDE BIG BEN 
 He emerges on top of the invisible spaceship, and uncorks the bottle. Rose, looking slightly unsteady, ascends the steps, holding a couple of glasses. They are parked in front of Big Ben. 
 ROSE   (laughs nervously) : I'm standing on something... 
 Jack chuckles, and then takes a device out of his pocket. He flicks a switch and his spaceship appears under their feet. 
 ROSE (CONT'D) : Okay... you have an invisible spaceship... 
 JACK : Yeah... 
 ROSE : Tethered up to Big Ben for some reason... 
 JACK : First rule of active camouflage. Park somewhere you'll remember. 
 He pops the cork out of the bottle with a loud bang. Rose whoops and Jack laughs. Jack fills up their glasses. 
 
 
 
 EXT. WASTELAND 
 Nancy hurries across the train tracks. She hurries into an outer house and starts taking food out of her bag. She suddenly turns around, when she notices the Doctor standing in the doorway, watching her. 
 NANCY : How'd you follow me here? 
 THE DOCTOR : I'm good at following, me. Got the nose for it. 
 NANCY   (suspicious):  People can't usually follow me if I don't want them to. 
 THE DOCTOR : My nose has special powers. 
 NANCY : Yeah? That's why it's uh... 
 THE DOCTOR : What? 
 NANCY : Nothing. 
 THE DOCTOR   (persistently):  What? 
 NANCY   (teasingly):  Nothing! Do your ears have special powers too? 
 THE DOCTOR   (calmly) : What're you trying to say? 
 NANCY : Goodnight, Mister. 
 She turns away. 
 THE DOCTOR : Nancy. There's something chasing you and the other kids. Looks like a boy and it isn't a boy, and it started about a month ago, right? 
 Nancy turns back to him. 
 THE DOCTOR (CONT'D) : The thing I'm looking for. The thing that fell from the sky, that's when it landed. And you know what I'm talking about, don't you? 
 NANCY : There was a bomb. A bomb that wasn't a bomb. Fell the other end of Limehouse Green Station. 
 THE DOCTOR : Take me there. 
 NANCY   (shakes her head):  There's soldiers guarding it, barbed wire... you'll never get through. 
 THE DOCTOR : Try me! 
 NANCY : You sure you wanna know what's going on in there? 
 THE DOCTOR : I really wanna know. 
 NANCY : Then there's someone you need to talk to first. 
 THE DOCTOR : And who might that be? 
 NANCY : The Doctor. 
 The Doctor's brow furrows. Nancy turns away, and the Doctor gives a quiet, ironic laugh, clearly confused. 
 EXT. OUTSIDE BIG BEN 
 Rose and Jack are sitting on top of the spaceship, drinking the champagne. Rose stands up. 
 ROSE : You know, it's getting a bit late. I should really be getting back. 
 JACK : We're discussing business. 
 ROSE   (smiling) : This isn't business. This is champagne. 
 JACK : I try never to discuss business with a clear head.  (Stands, walks towards her).  Are you travelling alone? Are you authorised to negotiate with me? 
 ROSE : What would we be negotiating? 
 JACK : I have something for the Time Agency. Something they'd like to buy. Are you in power to make payment? 
 ROSE : Well, I, I should talk to my... companion. 
 JACK : Companion? 
 ROSE : Yeah, I should really be getting back to him. 
 JACK : Him? 
 ROSE   (laughing):  Do you have the time? 
 Jack, clearing his throat, takes the device out of his pocket and flicks a switch. Big Ben chimes right next to them. 
 ROSE (CONT'D) : Okay, that was flash.  (Laughs).  Th... that was on the flash side. 
 JACK   (moves closer, places his hands on her waist):  So... when you say "companion", just how disappointed should I be? 
 ROSE : Okay... we're standing in midair... 
 JACK : Mm-hm. 
 ROSE : On a spaceship... during a German air raid... do you really think now's a good time to be coming on to me...? 
 Her voice falters slightly as Jack raises her hands and places his lips upon them. Upon her words, Jack takes his lips away and pats her hand. 
 JACK : Perhaps not. 
 He walks away. 
 ROSE   (quickly):  Well, it was just a suggestion. 
 Jack turns back to her. 
 JACK : Do you like Glenn Miller? 
 He points the device over his shoulder, and "Moonlight Serenade" plays. He walks back to her, and they begin to slow dance. 
 JACK : It's 1941. The height of the London Blitz. The height of the German Bombing Campaign. And something else has fallen on London - a fully equipped Chula Warship. The last one in existence... 
 Rose's eyelids flutter closed, her head on his shoulder. 
 JACK (CONT'D) : ... armed to the teeth.  (Draws back slightly to look at her properly).  And I know where it is. Because I parked it. 
 Rose laughs. 
 JACK (CONT'D) : If the Agency can name the right price, I can get it for you. But in two hours, a German bomb is gonna fall on it and destroy it forever.  (He looks at her, suddenly more serious).  That's the deadline. That's the deal. And now, shall we discuss payment? 
 ROSE : Do you know what I think? 
 JACK : What? 
 ROSE   (dreamily):  I think you were talking just there... 
 JACK : Two hours, the bomb falls. There'll be nothing left but dust and a crater. 
 ROSE : Promises, promises... 
 JACK : Are you listening to  any  of this? 
 ROSE   (pulling herself together):  You used to be a Time Agent, now you're some kind of free lancer. 
 JACK : Well, that's a little harsh.  (Pulls her closer).  I like to think of myself as a criminal. 
 ROSE   (laughing):  I bet you do! 
 JACK : So, this companion of yours, does he handle the business? 
 ROSE : Well, I delegate a lot of that, yeah. 
 JACK : Well, maybe we should go find him. 
 ROSE : And how're you gonna do that? 
 JACK : Easy. I'll do a scan for alien tech. 
 He begins the scan using the device on his wrist. 
 ROSE   (to herself, delighted) : Finally, a professionnal. 
 EXT. WASTELAND 
 The Doctor stands on some steps a good distance away from the bomb site. He looks at it using his binoculars. Nancy stands behind him. 
 NANCY : The bomb's under that tarpaulin. They put the fence up over night. See that building? The hospital. 
 The Doctor looks over to where she indicates over the top of the binoculars. 
 THE DOCTOR : What about it? 
 NANCY : That's where the doctor is. 
 The Doctor zooms in on the hospital. 
 NANCY (CONT'D) : You should talk to him. 
 THE DOCTOR : For now, I'm more interested in getting in there. 
 He points back at the bomb site. 
 NANCY : Talk to the doctor first. 
 THE DOCTOR : Why? 
 NANCY : 'Cos then maybe you won't wanna get inside. 
 Nancy begins to go back up the steps. 
 THE DOCTOR   (without looking) : Where're you going? 
 NANCY :  There was a lot of food in that house. I've got mouths to feed. Should be safe enough now. 
 THE DOCTOR : Can I ask you a question? Who did you lose? 
 NANCY : What? 
 THE DOCTOR   (finally lowering the binoculars and turning to face her):  The way you look after all those kids. It's 'cos you lost somebody, isn't it? You're doing all this to make up for it. 
 NANCY : My little brother. Jamie. One night I went out looking for food. Same night that thing fell. I told him not to follow me, told him it was dangerous, but he just... he just didn't like being on his own. 
 THE DOCTOR : What happened? 
 NANCY : In the middle of an air raid? What do you think happened? 
 The Doctor nods, then smiles. 
 THE DOCTOR : Amazing. 
 NANCY : What is? 
 THE DOCTOR : 1941. 
 There are planes dropping bombs in the distance. A barrage balloon hovers above them. Small explosions in the air. 
 THE DOCTOR : Right now, not very far from here, a German war machine is rolling up the map of Europe. Country after country, falling like dominoes. Nothing can stop it. Nothing. Until one, tiny, damp little island says "no". 'No'. Not here. A mouse in front of a lion.  (Looks at Nancy).  You're amazing, the lot of you. Dunno what you do to Hitler, but you frighten the hell out of me. Off you go then... do what you've gotta do. Save the world. 
 He goes down the rest of the steps. Nancy turns and walks up them. The distorted vision of the child watches Nancy and we see his shadow follow her up the steps. 
 EXT. ABANDONED HOSPITAL 
 The Doctor goes to the gate of the hospital, and upon finding it locked, uses his sonic screwdriver to destroy the padlock. He undoes the chain, and enters Albion Hospital. 
 INT. HOSPITAL WARD 
 The Doctor enters a dark ward, where rows and rows of people are lying on beds, wearing gas masks, completely lifeless. He looks around at them all, brow furrowed, and leaves. 
 INT. HOSPITAL CORRIDOR 
 The Doctor comes out into a corridor, which is lit. 
 INT. HOSPITAL WARD 2 
 He enters another ward, which is lighter but still has rows of the gas mask people lying on the beds. He turns quickly upon hearing a slight sound behind him, and an old man, Doctor Constantine enters. 
 DR CONSTANTINE : You'll find them everywhere. Every bed in every ward. Hundreds of them. 
 THE DOCTOR : Yes, I saw. Why are they still wearing gas masks? 
 DR CONSTANTINE : They're not. Who are you? 
 THE DOCTOR : I'm, uh... are you the doctor? 
 DR CONSTANTINE : Doctor Constantine. And you are? 
 THE DOCTOR : Nancy sent me. 
 DR CONSTANTINE : Nancy? That means you must've been asking about the bomb. 
 THE DOCTOR : Yes. 
 DR CONSTANTINE : What do you know about it? 
 THE DOCTOR : Nothing. Why I was asking. What do you know? 
 DR CONSTANTINE : Only what it's done. 
 THE DOCTOR : These people, were they all caught up in the blast? 
 DR CONSTANTINE : None of them were. 
 He laughs slightly, but it turns into a nasty cough. He sits down in a chair just behind him. The Doctor takes a few steps towards him. 
 THE DOCTOR : You're very sick. 
 DR CONSTANTINE : Dying, I should think, I just haven't been able to find the time. Are you a doctor? 
 THE DOCTOR : I have my moments. 
 DR CONSTANTINE : Have you examined any of them, yet? 
 THE DOCTOR : No. 
 DR CONSTANTINE : Don't touch the flesh. 
 THE DOCTOR : Which one? 
 DR CONSTANTINE : Any one. 
 The Doctor, raising his eyebrows, takes his sonic screwdriver out of his pocket and approaches the nearest bed. He runs the screwdriver over the mask covered face of the body. 
 DR CONSTANTINE (CONT'D) : Conclusions? 
 THE DOCTOR : Massive head trauma, mostly to the left side...  (Runs screwdriver over the chest).  Partial collapse of the chest cavity, mostly to the right. There's some scarring on the back of the hand and the gas mask seems to be fused to the flesh but I can't see any burns. 
 DR CONSTANTINE : Examine another one. 
 The Doctor goes over to another body and does the scan again. The gas mask is fused to the flesh and the body bears the same scar on the back of the hand. He turns off his sonic screwdriver and turns to Doctor Constantine. 
 THE DOCTOR : This isn't possible. 
 DR CONSTANTINE : Examine another. 
 The Doctor hurries to another bed and does so. 
 THE DOCTOR : This isn't possible! 
 DR CONSTANTINE : No. 
 THE DOCTOR : They've all got the same injuries! 
 DR CONSTANTINE : Yes. 
 THE DOCTOR : Exactly the same. 
 DR CONSTANTINE : Yes. 
 THE DOCTOR : Identical, all of them. Right down to the scar on the back of the hand. 
 Doctor Constantine looks at his own hand, it has the scar. 
 THE DOCTOR (CONT'D) : How did this happen? How did it start? 
 DR CONSTANTINE : When that bomb dropped, there was just one victim. 
 THE DOCTOR : Dead? 
 DR CONSTANTINE : At first. His injuries were truly dreadful. By the following morning, every doctor and nurse who had treated him, who had touched him, had those exact same injuries. By the morning after that, every patient in the same ward had the exact same injuries. Within a week, the entire hospital. Physical injuries, as plague. Can you explain that? What would you say was the cause of death? 
 THE DOCTOR : The head trauma. 
 DR CONSTANTINE : No. 
 THE DOCTOR : Asphyxiation. 
 DR CONSTANTINE : No. 
 THE DOCTOR : The collapse of the chest cavity... 
 DR CONSTANTINE : No. 
 THE DOCTOR : All right. What was the cause of death? 
 DR CONSTANTINE : There wasn't one. 
 The Doctor looks at him, brow furrowed. 
 DR CONSTANTINE (CONT'D) : They're not dead. 
 He raps his stick against a tin bin, and all the patients suddenly sit up. The Doctor looks alarmed. 
 DR CONSTANTINE : It's all right. They're harmless. They just... sort of, sit there. No heartbeat, no life signs of any kind. They just... don't die. 
 THE DOCTOR : And they've just been left here? Nobody's doing anything? 
 The bodies lie down again. 
 DR CONSTANTINE : I try and make them comfortable, what else is there? 
 THE DOCTOR : Just you? You're the only one here? 
 DR CONSTANTINE : Before this war began, I was a father and a grandfather. Now I am neither. But I am still a doctor. 
 THE DOCTOR : Yeah. Know the feeling. 
 DR CONSTANTINE : I suspect the plan is to blow up the hospital and blame it on a German bomb. 
 THE DOCTOR   (looking around):  Probably too late. 
 DR CONSTANTINE : No. They are isolated cases, but... isolated cases breaking out all over London... 
 He coughs again. His speech starts to break up. The Doctor starts towards him. 
 DR CONSTANTINE (CONT'D) : Stay back, stay back.  (Coughs).  Listen to me... top floor. Room 802, that's where they took the first victim - the one from the crash site. And you must find Nancy again. 
 THE DOCTOR : Nancy? 
 DR CONSTANTINE : It was her brother. She knows more than she's saying. She won't tell me, but she mi... mi...  (He gags and clutches his neck).  M... mu... mee... 
 The Doctor watches him concernedly. Speech is a huge effort for Constantine. 
 DR CONSTANTINE (CONT'D) : Are... you... my... mum-my? 
 As the Doctor watches, a gas mask protrudes horribly out of Constantine's mouth. His eyes become the gas mask, and it fuses onto his face, and he goes limp. The Doctor hears voices in the distance. 
 JACK : Hello? 
 ROSE : Hello? 
 JACK : Hello? 
 The Doctor leaves the ward. 
 INT. HOSPITAL CORRIDOR 
 The Doctor emerges into the corridor. He meets Rose and Jack coming the other way. 
 JACK : Good evening. Hope I'm not interrupting, Jack Harkness.  (Shakes the Doctor's hand).  I've been hearing all about you on the way over. 
 ROSE   (to the Doctor):  He knows. I had to tell him about us being Time Agents. 
 The Doctor nods. 
 JACK : And it's a real pleasure to meet you, Mr Spock. 
 He pats the Doctor heartily on the shoulder, and walks off, leaving the Doctor looking rather bemused. 
 THE DOCTOR   (to Rose):  Mr Spock? 
 ROSE : What was I supposed to say, you don't have a name! Don't you ever get tired of "Doctor"? Doctor who? 
 THE DOCTOR : Nine centuries in, I'm coping. Where've you been? We're in the middle of a London Blitz, it's not a good time for a stroll. 
 ROSE   (starting to walk):  Who's strolling? I went by barrage balloon. Only way to see an air raid. 
 THE DOCTOR   (following):  What?! 
 ROSE : Listen, what's a Chula warship? 
 THE DOCTOR   (stops):  Chula? 
 INT. DINING ROOM 
 Nancy goes back into the house and starts to put a cloth over some of the food on the table. Suddenly, the radio springs to life, the child's voice transmitting through it 
 THE CHILD : Please, mummy. Please let me in. 
 Nancy spins round to face the radio. 
 THE CHILD (CONT'D) : I'm scared of the bombs, mummy. Please, mummy... 
 There is a crash from the hallway, making Nancy turn around. The shadow of the child is on the wall. 
 THE CHILD (CONT'D) : Mummy... mum-my... 
 Nancy looks around for somewhere to hide. She crawls under the table. 
 INT. HOSPITAL WARD 2 
 Jack scans one of the bodies. 
 JACK : This just isn't possible. How could this happen? 
 THE DOCTOR : What kind of Chula ship landed here? 
 JACK : What? 
 ROSE : He said it was a warship. He stole it. Parked it somewhere out there, somewhere a bomb's gonna fall on it - unless WE make him an offer. 
 THE DOCTOR : What kind of warship? 
 JACK   (agitated):  Does it matter? It's got nothing to do with this! 
 THE DOCTOR   (angrily):  This started at the bomb site. It's got everything to do with it. What kind of warship? 
 JACK : An ambulance!  (Turns on his wrist device).  Look. 
 A hologram of the warship appears above the device. 
 JACK (CONT'D) : That's what you chased through the Time Vortex. It's space junk. I wanted to kid you it was valuable. It's empty. I made sure of it. Nothing but a shell. I threw it at you. Saw your time travel vehicle, love the retro look, by the way, nice panels, threw you the bait... 
 ROSE : Bait? 
 JACK : I wanted to sell it to you and then destroy it before you found out it was junk. 
 ROSE : You said it was a war ship. 
 JACK : They have ambulances in wars.  (Walks away from them, annoyed).  It was a con. I was conning you, that's what I am, I'm a con man. I thought you were Time Agents but you're not, are you? 
 ROSE : Just a couple more free-lancers. 
 JACK : Ahh... should've known. The way you guys are blending in with the local colour, I mean, Flag Girl was bad enough, but U-Boat Captain? 
 Both Rose and the Doctor look uncomfortably at their clothes. 
 JACK : Anyway... Whatever's happening here has got nothing to do with that ship. 
 ROSE   (looking around):  What is happening here, Doctor? 
 THE DOCTOR : Human DNA's being rewritten... by an idiot. 
 ROSE : What d'you mean? 
 THE DOCTOR : I dunno, some kind of virus. It's converting human beings into these things.  (Nods at the bodies).  But why? What's the point? 
 INT. DINING ROOM 
 The child enters. 
 THE CHILD : Mummy? Where's my mummy? Mummy? 
 An apple falls out of Nancy's bag and rolls out from under the table. The child looks at it, walks over to it and bends down to pick it up. Nancy tries to make a run for it, but the child spins around, pointing a finger. The door slams shut and locks. Nancy rattles the handle fruitlessly. The child looks at her, still pointing. Nancy looks back. 
 THE CHILD (CONT'D) : Are you my mummy? 
 INT. HOSPITAL WARD 2 
 Rose bends over one of the bodies, examining it, when suddenly, it sits up. All the others do the same. Rose jumps backwards. They all start saying "mummy?" repeatedly. 
 ROSE : What's happening? 
 THE DOCTOR : I don't know. 
 The gas-mask people all get out of bed. 
 INT. DINING ROOM 
 Nancy backs away from the child. 
 THE CHILD : Mummy? 
 NANCY : It's me. Nancy! 
 INT. HOSPITAL WARD 2 
 The gas-mask people begin to enclose the Doctor, Rose and Jack. 
 THE DOCTOR : Don't let them touch you. 
 ROSE : What happens if they touch us? 
 THE DOCTOR : You're looking at it. 
 They still chant, 'mummy' as they back the three of them against a wall. 
 INT. DINING ROOM 
 THE CHILD : Are you my mummy? 
 NANCY : It's Nancy. Your sister. 
 INT. HOSPITAL WARD 2 
 The patients in the ward enclose the Doctor, Rose and Jack. 
 INT. DINING ROOM 
 The child advances on Nancy. 
 NANCY : You're dead, Jamie. You're dead! 
 She is now backed against the curtain. 
 THE CHILD : Mum-my... mum-my... 
 INT. HOSPITAL WARD 2 
 The gas-mask people have surrounded the Doctor, Rose and Jack, still calling for "mummy".
