 INT. LABORATORY 
 A man in a white coat presses down on a button which switches on a flood light, which silhouettes a familiar outline - a Cyberman. 
 DR KENDRICK : The prototype has passed every test, sir. It's working! 
 LUMIC : I hardly think "working" is the correct word. 
 A wheelchair seating John Lumic emerges from the shadows. 
 LUMIC (CONT'D) : That would apply only to machines. 
 DR KENDRICK : I'm sorry. I should say... it's alive. 
 LUMIC : Can it hear me? 
 DR KENDRICK : It might still be in shock. Bear in mind the brain has been welded to the exoskeleton. 
 LUMIC : Skin of metal...  (Spins in his wheelchair to face the Cyberman) ... and a body that will never age... or die. I envy it. Do you know me? Answer. Do you know me? 
 CYBERMAN : You are John Lumic. 
 Lumic gives a small, satisfied laugh. 
 LUMIC : My child. Mark this day, Doctor Kendrick. We are blessed! 
 DR KENDRICK : Well, it's not quite over yet, sir. We need Geneva's approval. Technically, this is a new form of life. And that contravenes the bio-convention. They need to ratify this. 
 LUMIC : And they will refuse me. 
 DR KENDRICK : Nonetheless, we need to tell them. 
 LUMIC : And if I don't? 
 DR KENDRICK : Well, I'm sorry, sir, but it's my duty. I shall have to inform them. 
 LUMIC : And how will you do that from beyond the grave? 
 DR KENDRICK : I don't quite understand... 
 LUMIC : Kill him. 
 Doctor Kendrick's smile fades, he turns around just in time to see the cyberman grasp his shoulder. His body is engulfed in electric blue light as he yells in pain. Lumic smiles as Kendrick slumps to the floor, dead. He turns to a computer and taps on the keyboard. 
 LUMIC (CONT'D) : Captain? 
 CAPTAIN   (through computer):  Yes, sir. 
 LUMIC : Inform all staff. We have a new destination. Set sail for Great Britain! 
 He smiles in anticipation. 
 OPENING CREDITS 
 INT. TARDIS 
 The Doctor, Rose and Mickey are hanging out in the TARDIS. The Doctor and Rose are both slumped in chairs next to each other while Mickey stands by the console. They are relating a story to Mickey. 
 THE DOCTOR   (enthusiastically):  And that weird munchkin lady with the big eyes? Do you remember? The way she looked at you!  And then she opens her mouth and fire comes out! 
 ROSE   (laughing):  I thought I was gonna get frazzled! 
 THE DOCTOR : Yeah! One minute she's standing there, and the next minute, rawwwh! 
 He and Rose mimic fire coming out of their mouths, killing themselves laughing. Mickey nods and smiles, not really following. 
 MICKEY : Yeah... where... where was that, then? What happened? 
 THE DOCTOR : Oh, it was on this um... uh, this uh... planet thing, asteroid. It's a long story, you had to be there. Um... what're you doing that for? 
 Mickey has his finger on a button on the console. 
 MICKEY : 'Cos you told me to... 
 THE DOCTOR   (blinks):  When was that...? 
 MICKEY : About half an hour ago... 
 THE DOCTOR : Um. You can let go now. 
 Mickey lets go. Rose sniggers. 
 MICKEY : Well, how long's it been since I could've stopped? 
 THE DOCTOR : Ten minutes? Twenty? ... Twenty-nine? 
 MICKEY   (indignantly):  You just forgot me! 
 THE DOCTOR : No, no, no! I was just... I was just... I was calibrating. I was just... no, I know exactly what I'm doing. 
 And the TARDIS console explodes. Violently. Sparks and flames fly everywhere. 
 EXT. THE VOID 
 The TARDIS falls through fire, the time vortex is no longer there. 
 INT. TARDIS 
 The Doctor scrambles to his knees and frantically tries to operate the console. 
 ROSE : What's happened?! 
 THE DOCTOR : The time vortex is gone! That's impossible, it's just gone! 
 EXT. THE VOID 
 The TARDIS falls vertically through the flame, very fast. 
 INT. TARDIS 
 THE DOCTOR : Brace yourself! We're gonna crash! 
 They crash, and the Doctor, Rose and Mickey are thrown backwards. Gas masks fall from the ceiling. All the light in the TARDIS has gone out and it is very dark. 
 THE DOCTOR (CONT'D) : Everyone all right? Rose, Mickey? 
 MICKEY   (from the other side of the console):  I'm fine. I'm okay, sorry. 
 They all stand slowly. The Doctor looks up at the rotor and the console. 
 THE DOCTOR : She's dead. 
 There is a clicking as the engines cool down. Smoke rises from the console. 
 THE DOCTOR (CONT'D)   (whispers):  The TARDIS is dead. 
 He walks slowly around the console. 
 ROSE : You can fix it? 
 THE DOCTOR : There's nothing to fix. She's perished. 
 He pulls a lever back and forth fruitlessly. 
 THE DOCTOR (CONT'D) : The last TARDIS in the universe... extinct. 
 ROSE : We can get help, yeah? 
 THE DOCTOR : Where from? 
 ROSE : Well, we've landed, we've gotta be somewhere. 
 THE DOCTOR : We fell out of the vortex, through the void, into nothingness. We're in some sort of no-place... the silent realm... the lost dimension... 
 MICKEY   (from the door, grinning):  Otherwise known as London! 
 He laughs and steps out of the door.  
 INT. THAMES EMBANKMENT 
 And into 21st century London. Rose and the Doctor follow him. 
 MICKEY (CONT'D) : London, England, Earth. Hold on... 
 He jumps down off the low wall and picks a paper out of a dustbin and looks at the cover. 
 MICKEY (CONT'D) : First of February this year, not exactly far-flung, is it? 
 Rose jumps down and looks over his shoulder. 
 THE DOCTOR   (jumping down, looking around):  So, this is London. 
 MICKEY : Yep. 
 THE DOCTOR : Your city. 
 MICKEY : That's the one. 
 THE DOCTOR : Just as we left it. 
 MICKEY : Bang on. 
 THE DOCTOR : And that includes the zeppelins? 
 Rose and Mickey look up at him, then follow his gaze and turn around, sure enough, the sky is full of zeppelins. 
 MICKEY : What the hell...? 
 ROSE : That's  beautiful. 
 MICKEY : Okay. So, it's London with a big international zeppelin festival. 
 THE DOCTOR : This is not your world. 
 MICKEY   (confused):  But if the  date's  the same...  (he works it out)  ... it's parallel, right? Am I right? Like a parallel Earth where they've got Zeppelins, am I right? I'm right, aren't I? 
 THE DOCTOR : Must be. 
 ROSE :  So, a parallel world where... 
 MICKEY : Oh, come on. You see it on films. Like an alternative to our world were everything's the same but a little bit different, like... I dunno - traffic lights are blue, Tony Blair never got elected... 
 ROSE   (distant):  And he's still alive... 
 She gazing at a poster right front of them. It depicts her father, Pete Tyler, a successful businessman, holding a bottle of Vitex. 
 ROSE (CONT'D) : A parallel world and my dad's still alive... 
 She makes towards the poster. The Doctor and Mickey follow. 
 THE DOCTOR   (sternly):  Don't look at it, Rose. Don't even think about it. This is not your world. 
 ROSE : But he's my dad... and... 
 She touches the poster, the picture of Pete springs to life for a moment, says "trust me on this", winks and gives the thumbs up. Rose steps back. 
 ROSE : Oh, that's weird. But he's real! 
 POSTER PETE : Trust me on this. 
 ROSE   (happily) : He's a success! He was always planning these daft little schemes, health-food drinks and stuff. Everyone said they were useless. But he did it. 
 The Doctor suddenly grasps Rose by the shoulders and bends slightly to look into her eyes. 
 THE DOCTOR   (urgently):  Rose, if you've ever trusted me, then listen to me now. 
 Rose glances back at the poster. 
 THE DOCTOR (CONT'D) : Stop looking at it! 
 Rose reluctantly meets the Doctor's eyes again. 
 THE DOCTOR : Your father's dead. He died when you were six months old. That is not your Pete. That is A Pete. For all we know, he's got his own Jackie, his own Rose. His own daughter who is someone else, but not you. 
 Rose's eyes start to wander back to the poster, but she tries to stop herself. 
 THE DOCTOR (CONT'D) : You can't see him. Not ever. 
 Rose gives a tiny nod. Mickey touches her shoulder comfortingly. The poster of Pete says 'trust me on this' repeatedly. 
 EXT. TYLER'S MANSION 
 A posh car with the registration plate "PETE 1" pulls into the driveway of an enormous house. Pete Tyler gets out of the car holding a bunch of flowers. He goes up to the door with them held behind his back, and enters. 
 INT. TYLER'S MANSION, HALLWAY 
 PETE   (calling, walking into the hall):  Hello? Sweetheart? Only me. 
 Jackie appears on the staircase, looking very rich and very discontented. 
 JACKIE   (coming down the stairs, ranting):  Oh. The bad penny. Was this your idea? Don't deny it, it's got your fingerprints all over it.  (mockingly, thumbs up). " Trust me on this". Oh, I can trust you all right. Trust you to cock it up. 
 PETE : What've I done now? 
 JACKIE : Have a look. 
 She turns and walks into yet another large room. Pete follows. Household staff are busy erecting a huge banner bearing the legend: Happy 40th Birthday. Jackie stands with her hands on her hips and looks up at it pointedly. 
 PETE : What's wrong with that? 
 JACKIE : Forty. It says forty. 
 PETE   (nonplussed):  You are forty. 
 JACKIE   (exasperated):  Well, I don't want the whole world telling, do I? 
 PETE : You're having a party tonight! 
 JACKIE : My thirty-ninth. My official biography says I was born on the same day as Cuba Gooding Junior, and that makes me thirty-nine, thank you very much. 
 She leaves the room. 
 JACKIE   (calling):  Rose? Come here! Rose? 
 Pete follows her back out into the hall. He holds the flowers out to her. 
 PETE : These are from the girls in the office. Happy birthday. 
 JACKIE   (snobbishly):  I've got hand-sculpted arrangements by Veronica of Reykjavik, and your secretary stopped off at a garage? I don't think so. And if you're giving out presents, where's my zeppelin? Everyone else has got one! 
 Pete slots the flowers into the banisters. Jackie calls up the stairs. 
 JACKIE (CONT'D) : Rose? Come on, Rose! 
 Jackie turns back to Pete, cocking her head slightly so he can see earpieces she has fitted. 
 JACKIE (CONT'D) : Look, you didn't even notice, did you? Special delivery. Got sent round today. Birthday present from Mr Lumic. Latest modal. Diamond studded. Pick up signals from Venezuela. 
 PETE : Why would you wanna pick up signals from Venezuela? 
 JACKIE   (annoyed):  Well, I don't know! But now I can find out! For God's sake, where is she? Rose? Oh, she needs a good bath before tonight, she's gonna be honking. Rose, come to mummy! 
 A small dog potters down the stairs to Jackie. 
 JACKIE (CONT'D) : Come on! There you are, my darling! 
 She pats Rose the dog on the head. Pete's phone rings. He answers (via the earpieces) and Jackie picks up Rose and carries her upstairs. 
 PETE : Mr Lumic! Jackie was just saying thank you. That's very kind of you. 
 INT. LUMIC'S ZEPPELIN 
 LUMIC   (in his zeppelin):  Those ear-pods are handmade. Tell her to take care. 
 INT. TYLER'S MANSION, HALLWAY 
 PETE : Course I will, course I will. I don't suppose you'll be uh, joining us tonight? For the party? We'd be very honoured. 
 INT. LUMIC'S ZEPPELIN 
 LUMIC : The world below can party. Some of us have work to do. My plans have advanced, Peter. The President has promised a decision. I'm flying in now. We'll be at the air slip by five o'clock. 
 INT. TYLER'S MANSION, HALLWAY 
 PETE : Right.  (Pause, making sure Jackie's not listening).  It's just that I promised I'd help the wife out tonight. 
 INT. LUMIC'S ZEPPELIN 
 LUMIC : If the President of Great Britain can make this meeting, then so can you. 
 INT. TYLER'S MANSION, HALLWAY 
 PETE : Oh I dunno, he's not married to Jackie, is he. 
 INT. LUMIC'S ZEPPELIN 
 LUMIC : Five o'clock, Mr Tyler. Famous day. 
 Lumic hangs up. Pete sighs and heads off. Lumic takes a deep breath through his breathing apparatus and then pushes it aside. 
 LUMIC (CONT'D)   (to the computer):  Voice-print access. John Lumic.  (His name appears on the screen).  Initiate ear-pod override. Subject: Jacqueline Tyler. 
 INT. TYLER'S MANSION, JACKIE'S BEDROOM 
 Jackie is in her bedroom, sitting at her dressing table and powdering herself. 
 INT. LUMIC'S ZEPPELIN 
 LUMIC (CONT'D) : Activate. 
 INT. TYLER'S MANSION, JACKIE'S BEDROOM 
 Jackie drops her brush as she freezes, the ear-pods activate and arch over her head, meeting in a blue light at the middle. 
 INT. LUMIC'S ZEPPELIN 
 LUMIC (CONT'D) : Download, Tyler residence, February the first, give me security arrangements for tonight. Passwords, encryptions, services. 
 INT. TYLER'S MANSION, JACKIE'S BEDROOM 
 Jackie is stock-still as the information is downloaded from her mind. 
 INT. LUMIC'S ZEPPELIN 
 After a few moments, it appears on the screen in front of Lumic. 
 LUMIC (CONT'D) : And restore. 
 INT. TYLER'S MANSION, JACKIE'S BEDROOM 
 The ear-pods retract back into themselves and Jackie unfreezes. She shakes her head slightly as if mildly disorientated, but dismisses it and picks up her brush to powder her faces again. 
 LUMIC (CONT'D) : Thank you, Mrs Tyler. Activate picture link. 
 Mr Crane appears on the screen. 
 LUMIC (CONT'D) : Mr Crane? 
 MR CRANE : Mr Lumic? 
 LUMIC : Events are moving faster than I anticipated. I need extra staff. 
 MR CRANE : Very good, sir. I shall go on a recruitment drive. 
 INT. LORRY 
 Mr Crane is sitting in the passenger's seat of a lorry. 
 MR CRANE   (to the driver):  Back her up. 
 The driver begins to reverse the lorry slowly. 
 INT. TARDIS 
 Mickey enters the pitch-black TARDIS, closing the door behind him. The Doctor rounds on him. 
 THE DOCTOR   (angrily):  I told you to keep an eye on her! 
 MICKEY   (dismissively):  She's all right... 
 THE DOCTOR : She goes wandering off, parallel world, it's like a gingerbread house! All those temptations calling out. 
 MICKEY : Oh, so it's just Rose then? Nothing out there to tempt me? 
 THE DOCTOR : Well, I don't know, I can't worry about everything... if I could just get this thing to... 
 He kicks the TARDIS console hard in his frustration. He walks slowly over to a chair, scowling. 
 MICKEY : Did that help? 
 THE DOCTOR : Yes. 
 MICKEY : Did that hurt? 
 THE DOCTOR : Yes. Ow. 
 He sits down and rubs his foot. 
 EXT. THAMES EMBANKMENT 
 Rose is strolling along the bank of the Thames. She sits down on a bench, clearly deep in thought. The zeppelins are chugging softly in the sky and she looks up at them. One flies right over her head, low in the sky. It is obviously Lumic's, as it has the Cybus logo stamped on the bottom. Her phone bleeps and she takes it out of her pocket. The message on the screen says "welcome - free trial period". She selects, and footage of the news plays. 
 NEWSREADER : ... And it's good news for Great Britain as John Lumic returns to the country of his birth. Mr Lumic, the inventor of high-content metal, has denied allegations of ill health. 
 LUMIC : We're all flesh and blood, but the brain is what makes us human. And my mind is more creative than ever. 
 NEWREADER : With shares in Cybus Industries doubling in price, Mr Lumic... 
 Rose glances up at the zeppelin, realising who must be inside it. Cue cryptic reference to Torchwood on the news. Rose closes off the report. 
 INT. TARDIS 
 THE DOCTOR   (uncomfortably) : We're not meant to be here. The TARDIS draws its power off the universe, but it's the wrong universe. It's like diesel in a petrol engine. 
 MICKEY   (sitting down next to him):  But... I've seen it in comics. People are hopping from one alternative world to another, it's easy. 
 THE DOCTOR   (withering look):  Not in the real world.  (Pause)  Used to be easy. When the Time Lords kept their eye on everything, you could hop between realities, home in time for tea. Then they died, took it all with them. The walls of reality closed, the worlds were sealed. Everything became that bit less kind. 
 MICKEY : Then how did we get here? 
 THE DOCTOR   (weary):  I dunno. Accident? Should've been impossible, now we're trapped. 
 There is a short, hopeless silence. Then... 
 THE DOCTOR (CONT'D) : What's that? 
 He has spotted a tiny green light glowing beneath the console. 
 MICKEY : What? 
 THE DOCTOR : That there, is that a reflection? 
 It's not. He and Mickey crouch, staring at it. 
 THE DOCTOR (CONT'D)   (excitedly):  It's a light! Is it? Is that a light? I think that's a light! That's all we need! 
 They remove the grilling. 
 THE DOCTOR (CONT'D) : We've got power! Mickey, we've got power! Ha! 
 INT. SCRAP YARD 
 The lorry we saw earlier reverses into some sort of scrap yard where a bunch of homeless people are milling around. Mr Crane strides over to them, stopping a moment to pat the back of the lorry, presumably signalling for someone on the inside to open it. 
 MR CRANE   (to the homeless men):  Gentlemen! Gentlemen! I beg your attention. Christmas has come early, so come and get it. 
 Two of his cronies let down a ramp into the back of the lorry, he has the full attention of the men. 
 MR CRANE (CONT'D) : Ah, smell that, comrades. Burgers and chips, sausage and beans... 
 The men, starving, hurry towards the van. One man, Jake, remains half hidden behind some junk, looking anxious. 
 MR CRANE (CONT'D) : Pork... chicken... and hot, sweet tea. All for free. 
 Jake hurries up behind one of the men, Morris, and tries to stop him from going any further. 
 JAKE   (urgently):  Don't go! 
 MORRIS   (staring at the lorry):  Oh, but there's food! 
 MR CRANE   (ushering men into lorry):  All you can eat, free of charge. Don't just stand there! Fill your faces with pasty and... 
 JAKE   (to Morris):  He's lying. 
 MORRIS : It's easy for you to say. When did you last starve? 
 JAKE : All those people disappearing off the streets. It's been going on for months. It's them. They're taking you away. 
 MORRIS : What for? 
 JAKE   (darkly):  Experiments. 
 Morris looks from him to the lorry, brow furrowed. 
 MORRIS : Oh, I'm so hungry... 
 He heads towards the lorry. 
 MR CRANE : So, come and get it while it's hot!  (Morris joins him, laughing).  That's it, kind sir! Get in there and fill your face! 
 Morris hops into the lorry. Unbeknownst to Crane, Jake has taken out a video camera and is filming them, out of sight. 
 MR CRANE (CONT'D) : Feast yourself, brother. Feast yourself. 
 Then, we cannot see what is happening but yells and shouts start to emit from the lorry and Morris struggles to get out but is pushed roughly back inside by Mr Crane's cronies. 
 MR CRANE   (CONT'D) : Take them away. 
 MORRIS   (terrified):  No! No, help! 
 The lorry doors are shut on him. 
 INT. TARDIS 
 The Doctor is right underneath the console and pulling out some important looking internals of the TARDIS. 
 THE DOCTOR   (deliriously happy):  It's alive! 
 MICKEY : What is it? 
 THE DOCTOR : It's nothing. It's tiny. One of those insignificant little power cells that no one ever bothers about, and it's clinging onto life. But with one little ounce of reality tucked away inside. 
 MICKEY : Enough to get us home? 
 THE DOCTOR : Not yet. 
 He picks up the power cell and sits back on the small set of stairs under the grilling. 
 THE DOCTOR (CONT'D) : I need to charge it up. 
 He holds it carefully, cupped in both his hands. 
 MICKEY : We could go outside and latch it up to the national grid! 
 THE DOCTOR : Wrong sort of energy. It's gotta come from our universe. 
 MICKEY : But we don't have anything. 
 THE DOCTOR : There's me... 
 He blows gently on the power cell and it glows brightly. The Doctor beams. 
 THE DOCTOR (CONT'D) : I just gave away ten years of my life. Worth every second! 
 He giggles dorkishly. 
 EXT. THAMES EMBANKMENT 
 Rose searches for the name "Peter Tyler" on the Cybus Network which she now has on her phone. 
 INT. TARDIS 
 The Doctor and Mickey are both staring at the power cell with huge grins. The light fades. 
 MICKEY : It's going out. Is that okay? 
 THE DOCTOR : It's on a recharging cycle. 
 It grows brighter again, and then back to dim and so on. 
 THE DOCTOR (CONT'D) : It'll loop round, power back up and be ready to take us home in, oh, twenty-four hours? 
 He kisses the power cell. 
 MICKEY : So, that gives us twenty-four hours on a parallel world? 
 THE DOCTOR : Surely! As long as we keep our heads down. Easy. No problem. 
 He tosses the power cell in the air and catches it again. 
 THE DOCTOR (CONT'D)   (standing):  Let's go and tell her. 
 EXT. THAMES EMBANKMENT 
 The Doctor and Mickey come across Rose sitting on her bench. 
 THE DOCTOR : There you are! You all right? No applause, I fixed it!  (Shows her the power cell).  Twenty-four hours, then we're flying back to reality. 
 He sits down on the bench and holds the power cell up to show her. She doesn't even glance at it, lost in her own thoughts. 
 THE DOCTOR (CONT'D)   (grin fading, noticing the mobile):  What is it? 
 ROSE : My phone connected. There's this... Cybus Network, it finds your phone. It gave me Internet access. 
 THE DOCTOR : Rose, whatever it says, this is the wrong world. 
 ROSE : I don't exist. 
 THE DOCTOR : What do you mean? 
 ROSE : There's no Rose Tyler. I was never born. There's Pete, my dad, and Jackie... he still married mum... but they never had kids. 
 THE DOCTOR   (trying to snatch the mobile):  Give me that phone. 
 Rose pulls it away from his grasp. 
 ROSE : They're rich. They've got a house and cars, and everything they want.  (She pauses, thinking).  But they haven't got me. 
 She sounds close to tears. She stands, walking away from bench. Then she turns to face the Doctor. 
 ROSE (CONT'D) : I've gotta see him. 
 THE DOCTOR : You can't. 
 ROSE : I just wanna see him. 
 THE DOCTOR : I can't let you! 
 ROSE   (angrily):  You just said twenty-four hours! 
 THE DOCTOR : You can't become their daughter, that's not the way it works! Mickey, tell her. 
 MICKEY   (standing):  Twenty-four hours, yeah? 
 THE DOCTOR   (bewildered):  Where're you going? 
 MICKEY : Well, I can do what I want! 
 ROSE   (walking backwards in the opposite direction):  I've got the address and everything. 
 THE DOCTOR   (looking from one to the other frantically):  Stay where you are, both of you! Rose, come back here! Mickey, come back here right now! 
 ROSE : I just wanna see him. 
 MICKEY : Yeah, I've got things to see and all. 
 THE DOCTOR : Like what? 
 MICKEY : Well, you don't know anything about me, do ya? It's always about Rose. I'm just a spare part. 
 ROSE   (walking away):  I'm sorry. I've gotta go. 
 The Doctor turns from Rose to Mickey. They're both walking away from him and he doesn't know which way to turn. 
 MICKEY   (gesturing to Rose):  Go on then. No choice, is there? You can only chase after one of us, and it's never gonna be me, is it? 
 Rose stops walking backwards, turns and leaves. 
 THE DOCTOR   (to Mickey):  Back here in twenty-four hours! 
 And he runs after Rose. Mickey watches his retreating back. 
 MICKEY (CONT'D)   (to himself):  Yeah. If I haven't found something better. 
 He turns away. 
 EXT. AIRFIELD 
 As Lumic's zeppelin arrives at the air slip, a car pulls up and the President and two other men get out. Pete, who is already there, approaches the President. 
 PRESIDENT : Mr Tyler. What the matter couldn't wait until tonight? 
 PETE   (shaking his hand):  Mr President. Honoured. I'm on the fast-track program. Cybus Industries have pulled up my company, so I'm part of the firm now. 
 PRESIDENT : Some people say they've bought my Government. 
 PETE   (laughing):  I've never heard anybody say that. Never.  (Winks, thumbs up).  You can trust me on this. 
 PRESIDENT : I tried your drink. That Vitex stuff. It tastes like Pop. 
 PETE : Well, it is Pop. 
 PRESIDENT : You made money by selling a health-food drink into a sick world. Not quite the ordinary Joe you appear to be, are you? 
 Pete looks like he doesn't quite know what to say. The President sighs. 
 PRESIDENT (CONT'D) : He does like to keep us waiting. 
 He walks off. Pete follows. They stop at the foot of the steps descending from the zeppelin. 
 PRESIDENT (CONT'D) : But tell me - you've had a chance to observe John Lumic more than most. What's your opinion? 
 PETE : He's very sharp, I'd say. Sharp as ever. Very clever man. Brilliant, in fact. 
 PRESIDENT : Then, you don't think he's insane? 
 PETE : That's not the word I would've used, no. 
 PRESIDENT : I see. 
 He begins to climb the steps into the zeppelin. Pete follows. 
 EXT. ALONGSIDE FACTORY 
 Mickey is walking alongside a Cybus Industries factory. The military are barring the road ahead. The soldier approaches Mickey. 
 MICKEY : Am I all right to get past? 
 SOLDIER : Yeah. No bother. Curfew doesn't start 'til ten. 
 MICKEY : There's a curfew? 
 SOLDIER   (incredulous):  Course there is. Where've you been living, mate? Up there with the toffs? 
 He looks up at the zeppelins in the sky. Mickey follows his gaze. 
 MICKEY : I wish.  (Walks on).  See ya. 
 One of the soldiers lifts the barrier for him and he goes on his way. 
 EXT. STREET 
 Rose and the Doctor are walking down a street. 
 ROSE : Mickey's mum just couldn't cope. His dad hung around for a while, but then he just sort of wandered off. He was brought up by his gran.  (She smiles).  She was such a great woman. God, she used to slap him!  (Serious again).  And then she died. She tripped and fell down the stairs. It's about five years ago, now. I was still in school. 
 THE DOCTOR : I never knew. 
 ROSE : Well, you never asked. 
 THE DOCTOR : You never said! 
 ROSE : That's Mickey. I s'pose I... we just... take him for granted. Do you think she's still alive, his gran? 
 THE DOCTOR : Could be. Like I said, parallel world, gingerbread house. We need to get out of here as fast as we can. 
 A short alarm sounds and everyone around them suddenly freezes. The Doctor and Rose look around at them, confused. 
 ROSE : What're they all doing? 
 THE DOCTOR : They've stopped... 
 Everyone is wearing earpieces, which flash and beep quietly. The Doctor pauses beside one man and squints at his earpiece. 
 THE DOCTOR (CONT'D) : It's the earpieces... like Bluetooth attachments, but everyone's connected together. 
 Rose's phone beeps. She takes it out of her pocket and looks at it. 
 ROSE : It's on my phone. It's automatic, look. It's downloading. Is this what they're all getting? 
 The Doctor peers over her shoulder and puts his specs on. Rose scrolls through the "daily downloads". 
 ROSE (CONT'D)   (reading):  News... international news... sport... weather... 
 THE DOCTOR : They get it direct. Downloaded right into their heads. 
 ROSE   (continuing):  TV schedules, lottery numbers... 
 THE DOCTOR : Everyone shares the same information. 
 He takes the phone from Rose and reads it. 
 THE DOCTOR (CONT'D) : Daily download published by Cybus Industries. 
 The download scrolls to "Joke". Everyone around them chuckles, and then go on their merry way. The Doctor and Rose stare, completely nonplussed as the crowd carry on as though nothing had happened. 
 THE DOCTOR (CONT'D) : You lot, you're obsessed. You'd do anything for the latest upgrade. 
 ROSE : Oi... not my lot. Different world, remember... 
 THE DOCTOR : It's not so far off your world. This place is only parallel. 
 He presses a few buttons on the phone. 
 THE DOCTOR (CONT'D)   (showing Rose):  Oh, look at that. Cybus Industries owns just about every company in Britain, including Vitex. Mr Pete Tyler's very well connected. 
 Rose does not reply, but hangs off his arm smiling innocently and does the puppy-dog-eyes until... 
 THE DOCTOR (CONT'D)   (sighs):  Oh, okay. I give up.  (Tosses her phone back to her).  Let's go and see him. 
 EXT. ROAD 
 Mickey turns a corner in a run-down looking area. He crosses the street. His pace slows slightly as he approaches one of the doors. He speeds up again and knocks three times. 
 RITA-ANNE   (from inside):  Who's that there? 
 The door opens and Mickey's blind grandmother stands on the threshold. 
 RITA-ANNE (CONT'D) : Who is it? I know you're there. Shame on you, tricking an old lady. I've got nothing worth stealing.  (Brandishes stick).  And don't think I'm gonna disappear! You're not gonna take me. 
 Mickey's just staring at her, overcome. 
 MICKEY : Hi. 
 Rita-Anne stops in her tracks. 
 RITA-ANNE   (hushed):  Is that you? 
 MICKEY : It's me. I came home. 
 She reaches out to him, touching his face. 
 RITA-ANNE : Ricky? 
 MICKEY : It's Mickey. 
 RITA-ANNE : I know my own grandson's name. It's Ricky. Now, come here. 
 They hug. 
 MICKEY   (so happy just to be with her):  Okay, I'm Ricky. Of course I am. Ricky, that's me. 
 She suddenly pushes him away and whacks him on the shoulder. 
 MICKEY : Ow! 
 RITA-ANNE : You stupid boy.  (Smack).  Where've you been? 
 MICKEY : Ow! Stop hitting me! 
 RITA-ANNE   (smack, smack, smack):  It's been days and days! I keep hearing all these stories. People disappearing off the streets. There's nothing of it on the download.  (She points to her earpiece).  But there're all these rumours, and... and whispers. I thought that God had disappeared you! 
 Mickey notices the torn carpet on the stair behind her. 
 MICKEY   (voice trembling):  That carpet on the stairs, I told you to get it fixed, you're gonna...  (He closes his eyes)  fall and break your neck. 
 RITA-ANNE : Well, you get it fixed for me. 
 MICKEY : I should' a done way back. I guess I'm just kinda useless. 
 RITA-ANNE : Now, I never said that. 
 MICKEY   (choking up):  I am, though. And I'm sorry, gran. I'm so sorry. 
 RITA-ANNE : Don't talk like that. Do you know what you need? A nice sit down and a cuppa tea. You got time? 
 MICKEY : For you, I've got all the time in the world. 
 RITA-ANNE   (laughs):  You say that, but it's all talk. It's those new friends of yours. I don't trust them. 
 MICKEY : What friends are they? 
 RITA-ANNE : Don't pretend you don't know. You've been seeing them. Mrs Chan told me. Driving about all helter-skelter, in that van. 
 Skid of tyres in the background. 
 MICKEY : What van's that, then? 
 RITA-ANNE : You know full well! Don't play games with me. 
 The van draws up sharply behind Mickey. 
 RITA-ANNE (CONT'D) : Get inside! 
 Jake leaps out of the van and grabs Mickey by the collar. 
 JAKE : I've been looking for you everywhere! 
 He pushes him inside the van. Mrs Moore, who is driving, shakes her head and wastes no time in driving off. 
 RITA-ANNE   (feeling around):  Mickey! Mickey! 
 
 
 
 INT. VAN 
 Jake and Mickey are sat opposite each other in the back of the van. 
 JAKE   (reprimanding):  Ricky, you were the one who told  us,  you don't contact your family 'cos it puts them in danger! 
 MICKEY : Yeah. Ricky said that. Course I did, just testing. 
 JAKE : I saw them. I taped them! They went round Black Friars gathering up the homeless like a child-catcher. They must've took four dozen. 
 MRS MOORE : The vans were hired out to a company called International Electromatics. But I did a protocol search... turns out that's a dummy company established by guess who? 
 MICKEY : I dunno, who? 
 MRS MOORE / JAKE : Cybus Industries! 
 Mickey nods, just going along with it. 
 JAKE   (to Mrs Moore):  And now we've got evidence! 
 MRS MOORE   (to Mickey):  Bad news is, they've arrested Thin Jimmy. So that just leaves you. 
 MICKEY : Leaves me what? 
 JAKE   (like it's really something to be pleased about):  The Number One. Top of the list. London's Most Wanted. 
 MICKEY : Okay, cool.  (Pause).  Say that again? 
 INT. LUMIC'S ZEPPELIN 
 At Lumic's meeting, he is showing his small audience a presentation of his new plans. The diagrams on the screen demonstrate as he speaks. 
 LUMIC   (presentation voice-over) : The most precious thing on this Earth is the human brain, and yet we allow it to die. But now Cybus Industries has perfected a way of sustaining the brain indefinitely within a cradle of copyrighted chemicals. And the latest advances in synapse research allows cyber-kinetic impulses to be bonded onto a metal exoskeleton. This is the ultimate upgrade. Our greatest step into cyberspace. 
 PRESIDENT : I'm sorry. Could we stop it there? 
 Lumic wrenches the breathing apparatus from his face, affronted. 
 PRESIDENT (CONT'D) : I don't need the pitch. I think we all know what this "ultimate upgrade" entails. And I'm here to tell you, John, the answer is no. 
 Lumic grunts. 
 PRESIDENT (CONT'D) : My government does not give you permission.  (He stands).  And I think no government ever will. 
 LUMIC : I prepared a paper for the ethical committee. 
 PRESIDENT   (ready to leave) : Oh, come on. It's not just unethical. It's obscene. 
 LUMIC   (desperate)  : Mr President... if I might make a personal plea. I am dying, sir. 
 PRESIDENT : I'm aware of that. And I'm very sorry. 
 LUMIC : Without this project, you have condemned me. My inventions have advanced. This whole planet... would you have all that perish? 
 PRESIDENT : You're a fine businessman, John. But you're not God. I'm really very sorry, but I think we should end it there. Mr Tyler, I'll see you tonight.  (Pete nods).  I think we could all do with a drink. Mr Lumic. 
 And he leaves. Lumic stares straight forwards, horror-struck. Pete turns to him. 
 PETE   (keeping the tone light):  Still, it's not the only country in the world. There's always New Germany. 
 LUMIC : This is the home land. My birthplace. You may leave. 
 PETE : Thank you, sir. 
 He leaves. Mr Lumic turns his wheelchair back to the screen and the computer. 
 LUMIC : Mr Crane? 
 Mr Crane's image appears on the screen. 
 MR CRANE : Ready and waiting, sir. 
 LUMIC : Did the override work? 
 MR CRANE : Well, needs a bit of fine-tuning, we weren't exactly delicate given the rush, but er, yeah. Yeah. It's all working. 
 INT. BATTERSEA POWER STATION, CONTROL ROOM 
 He stands, walks away from the computer. 
 MR CRANE (CONT'D) : I've been testing the system, sir. 
 He walks to the opposite end of the room where the homeless people who were abducted earlier are standing in a row, completely still as though hypnotised. They have the earpieces plugged in. Mr Lumic touches one. 
 MR CRANE (CONT'D) : They've grafted on a treat, these have. Given a little persuasion. If you care to observe, sir... 
 He takes a few steps away from them, holding some sort of remote control. 
 MR CRANE (CONT'D) : And turn to the right...  (They do)  ... and back to the left... 
 Again, they obey. 
 LUMIC   (coldly):  Are you having fun, Mr Crane? 
 MR CRANE   (sheepishly):  Oh, no, no, not at all, sir, no. It's just, well, it's er... irresistible. 
 LUMIC : Then resist. And start the upgrade. 
 MR CRANE : Did we get permission? 
 LUMIC : I am governed by greater laws, old friend. The right of a man to survive. Now, begin! 
 The screen goes static. Mr Crane turns back to the men. 
 MR CRANE : And turn to the left...  (They turn to the left)  ... forward march. 
 They march forward and through a door which is held open by a staff-member. The area beyond is glowing red. As they go in and disappear from sight, we hear them screaming. Mr Crane is leaning over one of the technicians shoulders at a computer terminal. 
 MR CRANE (CONT'D)   (wincing):  Oh ,  whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Let's cover up that noise. Erm... give us track number 19. 
 The technician obliges and "The Lion Sleeps Tonight" by "Tight Fit" blares out. Mr Crane wanders into the middle of the room, content. 
 INT. BATTERSEA POWER STATION, CYBER-CONVERSION FLOOR 
 The machines work on upgrading the homeless. The blades swoop down on them. We do not see what they're doing, but the music hardly covers up the screams of fear and pain. 
 EXT. BATTERSEA POWERSTATION 
 Cut to the deserted corridors of the factory, and then a shot from outside. The lights from the factory reflected serenely in the water giving no indication of the monstrosity occurring inside. 
 EXT. PREACHERS' HEADQUARTERS 
 The van pulls up outside a house. Jake hops out of the back first. 
 JAKE : There's a light on. There's someone inside the base. 
 Mickey hops down after him. 
 JAKE (CONT'D) : Mrs Moore, we've got visitors. 
 The three of them sneak down the side of the house like spies, guns at the ready. They crouch just outside the door. 
 JAKE (CONT'D) : One... two... three... go! 
 INT. PREACHERS' HEADQUARTERS 
 They burst into the house, Mrs Moore and Jake pointing the guns. Ricky, Mickey's counterpart, is inside. 
 RICKY : What the hell are you doing? 
 Mrs Moore and Jake look from him to Mickey, completely bewildered. 
 JAKE : What're you doing there?! 
 RICKY   (walking slowly forwards):  What am I doing here?  (He stares at Mickey, brow furrowed).  What am I doing there? 
 He points a finger at Mickey. Jake and Mrs Moore immediately spin around at turn their guns on Mickey, who raises his hands, eyes wide. 
 EXT. TYLER'S MANSION 
 An expensive car pulls up outside Pete's and Jackie's house. The Doctor and Rose are crouched in some nearby bushes, watching. 
 THE DOCTOR : They've got visitors. 
 ROSE : February the first, mum's birthday. Even in a parallel universe, she still loves a party. 
 THE DOCTOR : Well, given Pete Tyler's guest list, I wouldn't mind a look. And there is one guaranteed way of getting inside. 
 He waves the psychic paper around. 
 ROSE   (excited):  Psychic paper! 
 THE DOCTOR : Who do you wanna be? 
 INT. TYLER'S MANSION, DRAWING ROOM 
 Several waiters and waitresses enter the party from the kitchens, all holding trays of refreshments... followed by the Doctor and Rose, dressed up in the same garb. A woman takes some food from Rose's plate and walks off. 
 ROSE   (under her breath):  We could've been anyone. 
 THE DOCTOR : Got us in, didn't it? 
 ROSE : You're in charge of the psychic paper. We could've been guests. Celebrities. Sir Doctor, Dame Rose. We end up serving. I had enough of this back home. 
 They both smile politely as people take champagne and cocktail sticks from their trays. 
 THE DOCTOR : If you wanna know what's going on, work in the kitchens. 
 They retreat slightly to the side of the room so they can watch the proceedings, groups of important people chatting and laughing, photographs being taken. 
 THE DOCTOR (CONT'D)   (nodding towards the President):  According to Lucy, that man over there... 
 ROSE : Who's Lucy? 
 THE DOCTOR : She's carrying the salmon pinwheels. 
 He nods over to a young waitress at the other side of the room. 
 ROSE : Oh, that's Lucy, is it? 
 THE DOCTOR : ... Yeah! Lucy says, that is the President of Great Britain. 
 ROSE : What, there's a President, not a Prime Minister? 
 THE DOCTOR : Seems so. 
 ROSE : Or maybe Lucy's just a bit thick. 
 They move on their way with the trays. 
 PETE   (addressing the room as a whole):  Excuse me! Thank you very much. Thank you, if I could just have your attention, please? 
 MAN IN CROWD : Pete! Go on, Pete! 
 PETE : Thank you very much! 
 MAN IN CROWD : It's about time you did some work. I thought you liked them young! 
 INT. TYLER'S MANSION, HALLWAY 
 Rose follows the sound of his voice to the bottom of the large staircase. The Doctor follows. Pete is standing halfway up. 
 PETE : Um, I'd just like to say, er, thank you to you all, for coming on this er, this very special occasion. 
 Rose gazes up at him. 
 PETE (CONT'D) : My wife's... thirty-ninth. 
 The crowd chortle. 
 PETE (CONT'D)   (thumbs up):  Trust me on this... 
 The crowd laugh appreciatively. 
 PETE (CONT'D) : So, without any further ado, here she is. The birthday girl... my lovely wife... Jackie Tyler. 
 Rose strains for a look. The Doctor glances at her. Jackie descends the staircase, smiling at the crowd who applaud and cheer and snap photos. Rose stares at her. Jackie stands next to Pete. 
 JACKIE : Now, I'm not giving a speech, that's what my parties are famous for, no work, no politics, just a few good mates and plenty of black-market whisky. 
 This makes the crowd laugh again. 
 JACKIE (CONT'D)   (laughingly, spotting the President):  Pardon me, Mr President!  (He smiles).  So, yeah! Get on with it, enjoy, enjoy. 
 More cheers. Pete takes Jackie's hand and they descend the rest of the stairs to mingle with the crowd. 
 THE DOCTOR   (quietly, to Rose):  You can't stay. Even if there was some way of telling them. 
 ROSE : Course I can't. I've still got my mum at home, my real mum. I couldn't just leave her, could I. It's just... they've got each other. Mum's got no one. 
 THE DOCTOR : She's got you! Those two haven't!  (Sighs).  All these different worlds, not one of them gets it right. 
 JACKIE : Rose! 
 This is followed by a series of barking and yelps. 
 JACKIE (CONT'D) : There's my little girl! 
 The dog potters over to Jackie, who picks her up. 
 JACKIE (CONT'D) : Come to mummy, come to mummy! Yes, good girl! Good girl, aren't you? 
 The expression on Rose's face is priceless. The Doctor takes one look at her and bursts out laughing, but sobers at the look she gives him. 
 THE DOCTOR   (sheepishly):  Sorry. 
 EXT. BATTERSEA POWER STATION 
 Mr Crane is walking outside the factory. A metallic voice rings out as the newly created Cybermen march past in an orderly line. 
 CYBERMAN : Platoon now boarding. Platoon zero-L-two boarding. 
 Mr Crane addresses a staff member who is staring at them marching past. 
 MR CRANE : Stop staring. 
 MAN : Who are they, sir? 
 MR CRANE : I'm told they're the future. Ain't technology wonderful? Go on, get in the cab. Start her up. 
 MAN : Sir. 
 He leaves. Mr Crane's phone rings. 
 LUMIC : Mr Crane, are we mobile? 
 MR CRANE : Just about in the road, sir. And yourself? 
 LUMIC : I'm arriving, Mr Crane. Prepare the factory. 
 Mr Crane looks skywards at Lumic's zeppelin which is coming in. 
 LUMIC (CONT'D) : Now, send them forth, old friend. Let the good work begin. 
 INT. PREACHERS' HEADQUARTERS 
 Jake, Ricky and Mrs Moore have stripped Mickey to his boxers and tied him to a chair. Jake is using a some sort of device to scan the length of his body. The results are shown on the laptop Mrs Moore is using. Jake finishes. 
 JAKE   (to Ricky):  He's clean. No bugs. 
 RICKY   (staring at Mickey):  But this is off the scale. He's flesh and blood, how did that happen? 
 MRS MOORE : Well, it could be that Cybus Industries have perfected the science of human cloning...? Or your father had a bike? 
 Ricky glares at Mickey and circles him menacingly. 
 RICKY : Your name is Mickey, not Ricky? 
 MICKEY : Mickey. Dad was Jackson Smith. Used to work at the key cutters in Cliffton's Parade. 
 Went to Spain, never came back. 
 Ricky bends to get a closer look at him. 
 RICKY : But that's my dad. So... we're brothers? 
 JAKE : Be fair. What else could it be? 
 RICKY   (staring at Mickey, brow furrowed):  I don't know. But he doesn't just look like me, he is exactly the same. There's something else going on here, Jake. 
 MICKEY : So, who are you lot? 
 RICKY   (straightening, circling the chair again):  We, we are the Preachers. As in Gospel Truth. You see?  (Gestures his ears).  No ear plugs. While the rest of the world downloads from Cybus Industries, we, we have got freedom. You're talking to London's Most Wanted. But target Number One is Lumic, and we are going to bring him down. 
 MICKEY : From your kitchen? 
 Jake smirks. 
 RICKY : Have you got a problem with that? 
 MICKEY : No, it's a good kitchen. 
 The laptop bleeps. 
 MRS MOORE : It's an upload from Gemini. 
 MICKEY : Who is Gemini? 
 MRS MOORE : The vans are back. They're moving out of Battersea. Looks like Gemini was right. Lumic's finally making a move. 
 RICKY : And we are right behind him. Pack up, we're leaving. 
 EXT. STREET 
 A huge lorry from Cybus Industries drives past. The Preacher's van is hidden in the shadows. It pulls out after the lorry has gone. Ricky is driving. In the back, Jake gives Mrs Moore a gun. She loads it as Mickey looks on. Jake also loads his. 
 INT. TYLER'S MANSION, CORRIDOR 
 The Doctor detaches himself from the crowds and walks down a corridor. 
 INT. TYLER'S MANSION, STUDY 
 He almost walks past a dark, empty room with the door slightly ajar, but backtracks as he notices a laptop open on the desk inside. He looks warily behind him to check that the coast is clear, then sneaks quietly into the room, shutting the door behind him. He puts on his glasses and looks at the screen, and smiles. 
 INT. TYLER'S MANSION, HALLWAY 
 Rose watches from a distance as Jackie chats to the President, laughing raucously. Pete appears next to her, also watching Jackie. 
 PETE : I remember her twenty-first. Pint of cider in the George. 
 ROSE   (offering the tray):  Sorry, champagne? 
 PETE   (accepting):  Oh, might as well. I'm paying for it! 
 They laugh. Pete sips the champagne. 
 ROSE : It's a big night for you... 
 PETE : Well, for her... still, she's happy. 
 ROSE : Yeah, she should be. It's a great party. 
 PETE : Do you think? 
 Rose gives him the thumbs up and grins. 
 ROSE : You can trust me...! 
 PETE   (correcting her):  You can trust me on this. 
 ROSE : That's it, sorry, yeah! 
 They laugh. 
 ROSE (CONT'D) : So, um, how long have you two been married? 
 PETE : Twenty years. 
 ROSE : And no kids, or...? 
 PETE : We kept putting it off. She said she didn't wanna spoil her figure. 
 ROSE : It's not too late. She's only forty. 
 PETE : Thirty-nine. 
 ROSE : Oh, right, thirty-nine! 
 They chuckle. 
 PETE : It's still too late... I moved out last month. We're gonna keep it quiet, you know, it's bad for business. 
 Rose's smile has faded. She nods. There is a pause. 
 PETE (CONT'D) : Why am I telling you all this? We haven't met before, have we? 
 Rose stares at him. 
 PETE (CONT'D)   (staring at her, brow furrowed) : I dunno, you just seem sort of... 
 ROSE : What? 
 Pete considers her. He can't put his finger on it. 
 PETE : I dunno, just sort of... right. 
 There is another pause. Pete seems to get uncomfortable with the situation and moves away to talk to someone else. 
 PETE (CONT'D) : Stevey, how's things? How's it going at Torchwood? 
 Rose is left alone. 
 EXT. TYLER'S MANSION 
 Ricky and Jake are crouched in some bushes outside Pete's house, watching some men dressed in white get out of the back of a lorry. 
 RICKY : I don't know what they're doing, but they seem to be the target. Big house, fair bit of money... now we've got to find a way to get in. 
 INT. VAN 
 MRS MOORE   (to Mickey):  I've identified the address. It belongs to Peter Tyler. The Vitex millionaire. 
 MICKEY : Pete Tyler? 
 MRS MOORE : He's listed as one of Lumic's henchmen. A traitor to the state. 
 MICKEY   (shocked):  But... but... we've gotta get in there. 
 EXT. TYLER'S MANSION 
 RICKY   (into the comm):  Now, shut it, duplicate, that's what I just said. 
 A ramp is let down from the back of the lorry. We hear the sound of heavy feet marching. 
 RICKY (CONT'D) : What're they doing...? 
 A row of heavy metal feet march out of the van. 
 RICKY (CONT'D) : What the hell are they? 
 After a few more moments, Ricky and Jake evidently decide to make a hasty retreat. 
 INT. TYLER'S MANSION, STUDY 
 The Doctor has found a presentation of the structure of the Cybermen. Lumic's voice narrates. 
 LUMIC   (voice-over):  The most precious thing on this Earth is the human brain... 
 EXT. TYLER'S MANSION, PORCH 
 Jackie is alone just outside on the porch. Rose spots her through the window and follows her outside. Jackie settles herself down on a bench. It's just the two of them. 
 ROSE : Mrs Tyler, is there anything I can get you? 
 JACKIE : The last twenty years back. 
 She laughs tiredly. Rose smiles uncertainly. 
 ROSE (CONT'D) : I can manage a glass of champagne... or a nice cup of tea? 
 JACKIE : Oh, that'd do me! 
 They laugh. The ice broken, Rose sits down next to Jackie, still holding the tray of champagne. 
 ROSE : My mum loves that. End of a long night, she never goes straight to bed, she always stays up just to have that last cup of tea. 
 JACKIE : Oh, I'm the same! 
 ROSE   (looking at her):  Two sugars... 
 JACKIE : And me! Pete always says, you know...  (She stops, shakes her head) ...  ah, never mind him. 
 ROSE : I was talking to him earlier. He's a nice man. You know, big of a Jack the Lad, I s'pose, even if he has got money, but... he's a good bloke. Better than most. 
 She looks at Jackie for a few moments. 
 ROSE (CONT'D)   (softly):  He's worth a second chance. 
 Jackie turns sharply. 
 JACKIE   (coldly):  Are you commenting on my marriage? 
 ROSE   (taken aback):  No, I was just... 
 JACKIE : Who the hell do you think you are? You're staff! You're nothing but staff, you're just the serving girl, for God's sake. 
 Rose looks away, hurt. 
 JACKIE (CONT'D) : And you are certainly not getting paid. Don't you dare talk to me. 
 Jackie stands and goes back inside, leaving Rose alone on the bench, upset. Suddenly, a floodlight of sorts snaps on making Rose squint. Shadowy figures march up the front lawn, but we cannot see them properly because of the bright light behind them. They come closer with an ominous "boom, boom, boom, boom". 
 INT. TYLER'S MANSION, STUDY 
 The Doctor is still inside watching the presentation on the laptop. 
 LUMIC   (voice-over):  This is the ultimate upgrade. Our greatest step into cyberspace. 
 The Doctor looks horrified as he realises what this means. 
 THE DOCTOR : Cybus. 
 Without a moment's hesitation, he dashes from the room. 
 EXT. TYLER'S MANSION, PORCH 
 Rose stands and watches the figures marching closer. After a few moments, she turns on her heel and runs back inside. 
 INT. TYLER'S MANSION, DRAWING ROOM 
 The Doctor winds his way through the crowds and spots Rose; they both go to the window and look outside at the figures. 
 THE DOCTOR   (hushed):  It's happening again. 
 ROSE : What do you mean? 
 THE DOCTOR : I've seem them before. 
 They get closer... 
 ROSE : What are they? 
 THE DOCTOR : Cybermen. 
 Several of them smash steel fists through the windows in order to gain entry to the house, which elicits screams from the crowd. They cower as the Cybermen step through the full length windows. Soon, they have everyone in the room circled with no way out. The President's communication device bleeps. 
 PRESIDENT   (distastefully):  Mr Lumic. 
 INT. LUMIC'S ZEPPELIN 
 LUMIC   (in his headquarters, through comm):  Mr President. I suppose a remark about crashing the party would be appropriate at this point. 
 He laughs evilly. 
 INT. TYLER'S MANSION, DRAWING ROOM 
 PRESIDENT : I forbade this. 
 LUMIC : These are my children, sir. Would you deny my family? 
 ROSE   (under her breath to the Doctor):  What are they? Robots? 
 THE DOCTOR : Worse than that. 
 PRESIDENT : Who were these people? 
 LUMIC : Doesn't matter. 
 ROSE : They're people? 
 THE DOCTOR : They were. Until they had all their humanity taken away. It's a living brain jammed inside a cybernetic body. With a heart of steel. All emotions removed. 
 ROSE : Why no emotions? 
 THE DOCTOR : Because it hurts. 
 PRESIDENT   (voice rising):  I demand to know, Lumic, these people, who were they? 
 LUMIC : They were homeless, wretched and useless until I saved them. And elevated them. And gave them life-eternal. And now, I leave you in their capable hands. Goodnight, sir. Goodnight, Mr President. 
 He hangs up. One of the Cybermen squares itself in front of the crowd. 
 CYBERMAN : We have been upgraded. 
 THE DOCTOR : Into what? 
 CYBERMAN : The next level of mankind. We are Human Point Two. Every citizen will receive a free upgrade. You will become like us. 
 PRESIDENT : I'm sorry.  (approaches the Cyberman).  I'm so sorry for what's been done to you.  (Turns, walks around).  But listen to me, this experiment ends. Tonight. 
 CYBERMAN : Upgrading is compulsory. 
 PRESIDENT : And if I refuse? 
 THE DOCTOR   (quickly):  Don't. 
 Rose glances at him. 
 PRESIDENT : What if I refuse? 
 THE DOCTOR   (stepping forward):  I'm telling you, don't. 
 PRESIDENT   (ignoring him):  What happens if I refuse? 
 CYBERMAN : Then you are not compatible. 
 PRESIDENT   (challenging) : What happens then? 
 CYBERMAN : You will be deleted. 
 He grasps the President, whose eyes widen in shock, by the neck. He is engulfed by electric-blue light as he is killed. The crowd scream and start to run. 
 PETE   (shouting):  Jackie?! 
 The people desperately run around, looking for a way out whilst some unfortunate individuals are attacked by the Cybermen. The room is chaos, the Doctor grabs Rose's hand and pulls her outside through one of the broken windows. 
 EXT. TYLER'S MANSION, GROUNDS 
 THE DOCTOR : There's nothing we can do! 
 Rose pulls away from him and tries to go back inside. 
 ROSE : My mum's in there! 
 The Doctor pulls her away again. 
 THE DOCTOR : She's not your mother! Come on! 
 They run up a slope, only to be greeted by another row of Cybermen. They quickly change direction and run around the side of the house. Pete leaps out of the window, Rose spots him and calls him over to them. 
 ROSE : Quick! Quick! 
 Pete runs after them. 
 INT. TYLER'S MANSION, HALLWAY 
 Inside, the Cybermen are quickly disposing of everyone. Jackie stands in a doorway and shrieks as one of the Cybermen spots her. 
 INT. TYLER'S MANSION, CORRIDOR 
 She turns on her heel and runs down a corridor, pursued by the Cybermen. She hurries down a flight of stairs into a cellar. 
 INT. TYLER'S MANSION, CELLAR 
 The Cyberman follows, stomping steadily down the stairs. 
 EXT. TYLER'S MANSION, GROUNDS 
 The Doctor, Rose and Pete reach the front of the house. 
 THE DOCTOR   (looking around) : Pete, there's no way out! 
 PETE : The side gates! 
 They run in the direction he indicates. 
 PETE (CONT'D) : Who are you? How do you know so much? 
 THE DOCTOR : You wouldn't believe it in a million years... 
 They skid to a halt as they are met by another row of Cybermen and are forced to change direction, two figures run towards the house, holding guns. 
 ROSE : Who's that?! 
 RICKY : Get behind me! 
 The Doctor, Rose and Pete stand/crouch behind Rickey and Jake as they fire their guns at the onslaught of Cybermen. The Cybermen stop marching. Rose fusses with Ricky's coat. 
 ROSE   (relieved):  Oh my God, look at you... 
 She pulls him into a tight hug, much to Ricky's bewilderment. 
 ROSE (CONT'D) : I thought I'd never see you again! 
 Rickey pulls away from her. 
 RICKY : Yeah, no offence, sweetheart, but who the hell are you? 
 Mickey sprints down the lawn towards them. 
 MICKEY : Rose!  (He stops when he reaches them).  That's not me. That's like... the other one. 
 Rose stares at him, and then at Ricky. 
 THE DOCTOR : Oh, as if things weren't bad enough, there's two Mickey's! 
 RICKY : It's Ricky. 
 MICKEY   (referring to the Cybermen) : But there's more of them... 
 The company look around them in fear as they are surrounded by Cybermen. 
 ROSE : We're surrounded... 
 Ricky raises his gun. 
 THE DOCTOR : Put the guns down. Bullets won't stop them. 
 Jake ignores this and fires a rally. The Doctor pushes his gun aside angrily. 
 THE DOCTOR (CONT'D) : No! Stop shooting, now! 
 The Doctor straightens and addresses the surrounding Cybermen. 
 THE DOCTOR (CONT'D) : We surrender! Hands up...  (The company put their hands up, including him)  ... there's no need to damage us, we're good stock. We volunteer for the upgrade program. Take us to be processed. 
 CYBERMAN : You are rogue elements. 
 THE DOCTOR : But we surrender. 
 CYBERMAN : You are incompatible. 
 THE DOCTOR : But this is a surrender! 
 CYBERMAN : You will be deleted. 
 THE DOCTOR   (shouting, frantic):  But we're surrendering! Listen to me, we surrender! 
 CYBERMAN : You are inferior. Man will be reborn as Cybermen but you will perish under maximum deletion. 
 The Cyberman raises it's arm and reaches towards the Doctor. The company look terrified. 
 CYBERMAN (CONT'D) : Delete. Delete. Delete!
