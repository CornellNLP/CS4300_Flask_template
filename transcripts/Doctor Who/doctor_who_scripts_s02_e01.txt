 INT. TARDIS 
 The Doctor treads over the grilling in the TARDIS. He slings his jacket over one of the supports and walks slowly up to the console where he begins to operate the controls. The engines start to hum. 
 EXT. POWELL ESTATE 
 Rose, Jackie and Mickey are outside the TARDIS... Rose packed and ready to go. 
 JACKIE : Have you got everything? 
 ROSE : I've got everything, don't worry. 
 JACKIE : Be careful. 
 They hug. 
 ROSE : You got to call Mo about that... 
 JACKIE : Oh, never mind Mo... 
 INT. TARDIS 
 The Doctor pulls a lever and the rotor begins to rise and fall. He gazes up at it and a proud smile spreads across his face. 
 EXT. POWELL ESTATE 
 ROSE : Okay, I'm going now. I love you! 
 She kisses her mum on the cheek. 
 JACKIE : I love you. 
 ROSE : Love you, love you... 
 INT. TARDIS 
 The Doctor smacks down on the controls. 
 EXT. POWELL ESTATE 
 Rose kisses Mickey goodbye. 
 MICKEY : Love you. 
 ROSE : Bye. 
 She goes to the TARDIS with a bounce in her step and a smile on her face. 
 INT. TARDIS 
 Rose closes the door behind her, shrugging the rucksack from her shoulders. The Doctor notices her and they beam at each other. The Doctor pulls a lever with extra vigour. 
 EXT. POWELL ESTATE 
 The TARDIS begins to dematerialize. Jackie is already walking away, but Mickey watches it go before following her. 
 INT. TARDIS 
 The Doctor and Rose are both operating the controls. 
 ROSE : So, where are we going? 
 THE DOCTOR   (grinning):  Further than we've ever gone before. 
 Rose grins back. 
 OPENING CREDITS 
 EXT. NEW EARTH 
 Rose and the Doctor step out of the TARDIS onto a windy stretch of grass. Rose's mouth drops open. 
 THE DOCTOR : It's the year five billion and twenty three... we're in the galaxy M87, and this... this is New Earth. 
 They are looking upon a futuristic city, with flying vehicles zooming to and fro. 
 ROSE : That's just... that's... 
 She bursts out laughing, in wonder. 
 THE DOCTOR   (nodding):  Not bad. Not bad at all! 
 ROSE : That's amazing. I'll never get used to this. Never. Different ground beneath my feet! 
 She jumps up and down excitedly. 
 ROSE (CONT'D) : Different sky...! What's that smell? 
 The Doctor bends down and pulls some grass up. He shows it to her. 
 THE DOCTOR : Apple grass. 
 ROSE : Apple grass...! 
 THE DOCTOR : Yeah, yeah! 
 ROSE : That's beautiful! 
 She gazes up at the Doctor with a wide smile. 
 ROSE (CONT'D) : Oh, I love this. Can I just say... 
 She links her arm through his. 
 ROSE (CONT'D) : ... travelling with you... I love it. 
 THE DOCTOR : Me too. 
 Rose laughs and the Doctor grins. 
 THE DOCTOR (CONT'D) : Come on! 
 He grabs her hand and they dash off. 
 INT. HOSPITAL BASEMENT 
 The Doctor and Rose are being watched through a reddish-tinged orb, by a pale man covered with interesting patterns. His eyes widen. 
 CHIP   (awestruck):  Human! She's pure-blood human. 
 He twists a control to zoom in. 
 CHIP (CONT'D) : Closer. Closer! 
 EXT. NEW EARTH 
 One of the metal spiders (as seen in: The End of the World) scurries closer to where the Doctor and Rose lie sprawled on the grass, lying on the Doctor's coat. 
 THE DOCTOR : So, the year five billion... the sun expands, the Earth gets roasted. 
 ROSE   (smiling):  That was our first date. 
 THE DOCTOR   (leaning back to look at her):  We had chips! 
 They giggle. 
 THE DOCTOR (CONT'D) : So anyway, planet gone, all rocks and dust, but the human race lives on, spread out across the stars. Soon as the Earth burns up... oh, yeah, they get all nostalgic... big revival movement... but find this place! 
 He sits up for a better look at the view. 
 THE DOCTOR (CONT'D) : Same size as the Earth... same air... same orbit... lovely! Call goes out, the humans move in! 
 ROSE : What's the city called? 
 THE DOCTOR : New New York. 
 ROSE   (skeptically):  Oh, come on. 
 THE DOCTOR : It is! It's the City of New New York! 
 He pauses, thinking. 
 THE DOCTOR (CONT'D) : Strictly speaking, it's the fifteenth New York since the original. So that makes it New New New New New New New New New New New New New New New York. 
 Rose smiles down at him, reminiscing. He notices. 
 THE DOCTOR (CONT'D) : What? 
 ROSE : You're so different. 
 THE DOCTOR : New New Doctor. 
 Rose giggles and the Doctor chuckles. The metal spider watches them. 
 INT. HOSPITAL BASEMENT 
 Chip is operating the controls and turns around at the sound of Cassandra's voice. 
 CASSANDRA : Impossible. I recognize that child. Her face. Show me her face! 
 CHIP : Closer. Closer! 
 EXT. NEW EARTH 
 The spider scurries across the grass. 
 INT. HOSPITAL BASEMENT 
 CHIP (CONT'D) : Face! Face! Face! 
 EXT. NEW EARTH 
 ROSE   (getting up):  Can we go and visit New New York... so good they named it twice? 
 THE DOCTOR   (also getting up):  Well... I thought we might go there first. 
 He nods towards a large building in the distance, on the coast. 
 ROSE : Why? What is it? 
 He has trouble getting his coat on because of the wind, so Rose helps him. 
 THE DOCTOR : Some sort of hospital. Green moon on the side... that's the universal symbol for hospitals. 
 ROSE : Hmm! 
 THE DOCTOR : I got this. 
 He pulls out his psychic paper. 
 THE DOCTOR (CONT'D) : A message on the psychic paper. 
 The words: Ward 26... Please Come, scrawl across the paper. 
 THE DOCTOR (CONT'D) : Someone wants to see me. 
 He tucks it back in his pocket. 
 ROSE : Hmm! And I thought we were just sight-seeing. Come on then! Let's go and buy some grapes. 
 She links her arm through his. The spider follows them. 
 INT. HOSPITAL BASEMENT 
 Cassandra gasps. 
 CASSANDRA : Rose Tyler! I knew it! That dirty blonde assassin! 
 CHIP : She's coming here, mistress! 
 CASSANDRA : This is beyond coincidence! This is destiny. At last I can be revenged on that little... 
 INT. NEW EARTH HOSPITAL 
 Rose and the Doctor walk through the hospital doors and into the reception. 
 ROSE : Bit rich coming from you. 
 THE DOCTOR : I can't help it! I don't like hospitals... they give me the creeps! 
 PA : The Pleasure Gardens will now take visitors carrying green or blue identification cards for the next fifteen minutes. Visitors are reminded that cuttings from the gardens are not permitted. 
 ROSE   (looking around):  Very smart. Not exactly NHS. 
 THE DOCTOR : No shop. I like the little shop! 
 ROSE : I thought this far in the future, they'd have cured everything. 
 THE DOCTOR : The human race moves on, but so do the viruses. It's an ongoing war. 
 A cat nurse walks by and nods politely to Rose, who stares at her. 
 ROSE   (pointing):  They're cats. 
 THE DOCTOR : Now, don't stare... think what you look like to them, all... 
 He looks her up and down. 
 THE DOCTOR (CONT'D) : Pink and yellow. That's where I'd put the shop! 
 He points over Rose's shoulder. 
 THE DOCTOR (CONT'D) : Right there! 
 Whilst Rose is looking, he walks over to the lift and steps inside. 
 INT. HOSPITAL LIFT 1 
 THE DOCTOR (CONT'D) : Ward 26, thanks! 
 INT. HOSPITAL BASEMENT 
 CHIP : Override controls. 
 INT. NEW EARTH HOSPITAL 
 ROSE : Hold on! Hold on! 
 She rushes to the lift, but too late... the doors have closed. 
 INT. HOSPITAL LIFT 1 
 THE DOCTOR   (through the doors):  Oh, too late... I'm going up. 
 INT. NEW EARTH HOSPITAL 
 ROSE : It's all right, there's another lift. 
 She rushes to the other lift and presses the button. 
 INT. HOSPITAL LIFT 1 
 THE DOCTOR   (calling down):  Ward 26. And watch out for the disinfectant. 
 INT. HOSPITAL BASEMENT 
 Chip watches through the orb. 
 INT. NEW EARTH HOSPITAL 
 ROSE   (calling up):  Watch out for what? 
 INT. HOSPITAL LIFT 1 
 THE DOCTOR : The disinfectant! 
 INT. NEW EARTH HOSPITAL 
 ROSE : The what? 
 INT. HOSPITAL LIFT 1 
 THE DOCTOR : The di... oh, you'll find out. 
 INT. HOSPITAL LIFT 2 
 Rose steps into the lift. 
 ROSE   (awkwardly):  Um... Ward 26. Thanks... 
 The doors close and the lift goes down. 
 INT. HOSPITAL LIFT 1 
 SPEAKER : Commence stage one... disinfection. 
 Green lights flash on and the Doctor is soaked in a shower of disinfectant. He is perfectly calm about this. 
 INT. HOSPITAL LIFT 2 
 SPEAKER (CONT'D) : Commence stage one... disinfection. 
 Rose is also soaked in the disinfectant. She screams. 
 INT. HOSPITAL LIFT 1 
 The Doctor smoothes his hands through his hair. 
 INT. HOSPITAL LIFT 2 
 Rose smacks the walls frantically with her eyes screwed shut, trying to turn the shower off. 
 INT. HOSPITAL LIFT 1 
 A white powder is puffed onto the Doctor, who barely reacts. 
 INT. HOSPITAL LIFT 2 
 The same white powder is puffed onto Rose. She squeezes her eyes shut, looking shocked and a bit disgusted. 
 INT. HOSPITAL LIFT 1 
 A blow-dryer engages. The Doctor looks as though he is enjoying the experience immensely, spreading his coat out to dry and smiling happily. 
 INT. HOSPITAL LIFT 2 
 After the initial shock, Rose tries to tidy her hair in the gusts of wind from the blow-dryer. 
 INT. WARD 26 
 The lift doors slide open at ward 26 and the Doctor steps out, looking very well groomed. His hair is perfectly tidy for once. 
 INT. HOSPITAL BASEMENT 
 Rose steps out at what seems to be some sort of cellar. She is still pulling at her hair, which is looking quite neat. 
 CHIP   (some way down the corridor):  The Human child is clean. 
 ROSE : Um... I'm looking for Ward 26...? 
 CHIP : This way, Rose Tyler. 
 He scurries off. Rose follows him apprehensively. She picks up a metal rod just in case. 
 INT. WARD 26 
 The Doctor is lead into the ward by Sister Jatt. 
 THE DOCTOR   (looking around):  Nice place. No shop, downstairs. I'd have a shop. Not a big one... just a shop. So people can shop. 
 SISTER JATT   (surprised):  The hospital is a place of healing. 
 THE DOCTOR : A shop does some people the world of good. Not me. Other people... 
 They start to walk. The Doctor sees a patient who is completely red. 
 SISTER JATT : The Sisters of Plentitude take a lifelong vow to help. And to mend. 
 They pass a bed holding an extremely fat man (The Duke of Manhattan) looking as though he is about to turn to stone. By the bed is a very prim woman... Frau Clovis. 
 FRAU CLOVIS   (indignantly):  Excuse me! 
 She approaches the Doctor. 
 FRAU CLOVIS (CONT'D) : Members of the public may only gaze upon the Duke of Manhattan with written permission from the Senate of New New York. 
 THE DOCTOR   (nodding to the Duke):  That's Petrifold Regression, right? 
 DUKE : I'm dying, sir. A lifetime of charity and abstinence. And it ends like this. 
 FRAU CLOVIS : Any statements made by the Duke of Manhattan may not be made public without official clearance. 
 DUKE   (gasps):  Frau Clovis! 
 She rushes to his side. He grasps her hand. 
 DUKE (CONT'D) : I'm so weak! 
 FRAU CLOVIS   (outraged):  Sister Jatt! A little privacy, please! 
 Sister Jatt leads the Doctor away. 
 SISTER JATT : He'll be up and about in no time. 
 THE DOCTOR : I doubt it. Petrifold Regression? He's turning to stone. There won't be a cure for... oh... a thousand years? He might be up and about, but only as a statue... 
 SISTER JATT : Have faith in the sisterhood. But is there no one here you recognize? 
 The Doctor looks around. His eye is caught. 
 SISTER JATT : It's rather unusual to visit without knowing the patient. 
 THE DOCTOR : No. I think I've found him. 
 Sister Jatt follows his gaze. The Face of Boe is in the corner of the ward by the window. They approach him and the nurse he is with. 
 SISTER JATT : Novice Hame... if I can leave this gentleman in your care? 
 THE DOCTOR : Oh, I think my friend got lost. Uh... Rose Tyler. Could you ask at reception? 
 SISTER JATT : Certainly, sir. 
 She leaves. Novice Hame and the Doctor look at the Face of Boe. 
 NOVICE HAME : I'm afraid the Face of Boe's asleep. That's all he tends to do these days. Are you a friend, or...? 
 THE DOCTOR : We met just the once on Platform One. What's wrong with him? 
 NOVICE HAME : I'm so sorry. I thought you knew. The Face of Boe is dying. 
 THE DOCTOR : Of what? 
 NOVICE HAME : Old age. The one thing we can't cure. He's thousands of years old. Some people say millions. Although, that's impossible. 
 THE DOCTOR   (smiling):  Oh, no... I like impossible. 
 He kneels before the Face of Boe . 
 THE DOCTOR (CONT'D) : I'm here. I look a bit different, but it's me... it's the Doctor... 
 He places a hand on the tank. The Face of Boe sighs. 
 INT. HOSPITAL BASEMENT 
 Rose emerges from the corridor into a room where an old tape is playing. She curiously looks at the flickering image being projected onto the screen. It is a glamourous party scene, everyone present laughing and holding champagne. Cassandra is there, talking to everyone and as she was before all her surgery. 
 CASSANDRA   (on tape):  I mean, you never know what your life's going to be like! Ever! I'm bored with this drink. 
 She hands it away to someone. 
 CASSANDRA   (CONT'D)   (on tape):  Anyway... oh, hello darling! Now, don't! Stop it! 
 She pushes a man playfully in the chest. 
 ROSE : Wait a minute... that's... 
 She spins around, and there is Cassandra. Chip cowers beside her. 
 CASSANDRA : Peekaboo! 
 ROSE   (holding up the metal rod):  Don't you come anywhere near me, Cassandra. 
 CASSANDRA : Why? What do you think I'm going to do? Flap you to death? 
 ROSE : Yeah, but... what about Gollum? 
 She gestures to Chip. 
 CASSANDRA : Oh... that's just Chip. He's my pet. 
 CHIP : I worship the mistress! 
 CASSANDRA : Moisturize me, moisturize me... 
 Chip picks up a canister and squirts Cassandra with it. 
 CASSANDRA (CONT'D) : He's not even a proper life-form. He's a force-grown clone. I modelled him on my favourite pattern. But he's so faithful. Chip sees to my physical needs. 
 ROSE : I hope that means food. How comes you're still alive? 
 CASSANDRA : After you murdered me. 
 ROSE : That was your own fault. 
 CHIP : The brain of my mistress survived. And her pretty blue eyes were salvaged from the bin. 
 Cassandra looks flattered. 
 ROSE : What about the skin? I saw it, you... 
 She laughs in disbelief. 
 ROSE : You got ripped apart. 
 CASSANDRA : That piece of skin was taken from the front of my body. This piece is the back. 
 ROSE   (laughing):  Right! So you're talking out of your... 
 CASSANDRA : Ask not. 
 CHIP : The mistress was lucky to survive. Chip secreted mi'lady into the hospital. 
 ROSE : So they don't know you're here? 
 CHIP : Chip steals medicine. Helps mi'lady. Soothes her. Strokes her... 
 He raises a hand to stroke Cassandra. 
 ROSE : You can stop right there, Chip. 
 CASSANDRA   (sadly):  But I'm so alone, hidden down here... the last Human in existence... 
 ROSE : Don't start that again... they've called this planet New Earth! 
 CASSANDRA : A vegetable patch. 
 ROSE : And there's millions of Humans out there... millions of them. 
 CASSANDRA : Mutant stock! 
 ROSE : They evolved, Cassandra. They just evolved, like they should. You stayed still. You got yourself all pickled and preserved, and what good did it do you? 
 CASSANDRA   (referring to film):  Oh, I remember that night. Drinks for the Ambassador of Thrace. That was the last time anyone told me I was beautiful. After that it all became... such hard work. 
 ROSE : Well, you've got a knack for survival... I'll give you that. 
 CASSANDRA : But I've not been idle, Rose... tucked away, underneath this hospital... I've been listening. The Sisters are hiding something. 
 ROSE : What d'you mean? 
 CASSANDRA : Oh... these cats have secrets. Hush, let me whisper. Come close. 
 ROSE   (laughing):  You must be joking if you think I'm coming anywhere near you! 
 She takes a few steps backwards and is caught by a machine that binds her with light so she cannot move. 
 CASSANDRA : Chip! Activate the psychograft! 
 Chip bounds over to the controls. 
 ROSE   (scared):  I can't move! Cassandra, let me go! 
 Chip pulls a lever and bars of light come down from the ceiling and surround Rose like a cage. 
 ROSE   (CONT'D)   (frightened):  What're you doing?? 
 CASSANDRA : The lady's moving on. It's goodbye trampoline, and hello Blondie! 
 After a few seconds, a cloud of light jumps from Cassandra, across the room and into Rose. Chip releases the lever and Rose's body falls to the ground. 
 CHIP   (peering at her):  Mistress? 
 CASSANDRA-ROSE   (beginning to stir):  Moisturize me... 
 Chip hurries to retrieve the canister. 
 CASSANDRA-ROSE   (breathless):  How bizarre... arms... fingers... hair! Let me see! Let me see! 
 She springs to her feet and dashes to a mirror. Her eyes widen in horror. 
 CASSANDRA-ROSE   (horrified):  Oh my God. I'm a chav! 
 INT. WARD 26 
 PA : Hope, harmony and health. Hope, harmony and health. 
 The Doctor crosses the ward and gives Novice Hame a glass of water. 
 NOVICE HAME : That's very kind. But there's no need. 
 THE DOCTOR   (going to the window):  You're the one working. 
 NOVICE HAME : There's not much to do. Just maintain his smoke. And I suppose I'm company. I can hear him singing, sometimes. In my mind... such ancient songs... 
 THE DOCTOR : Am I the only visitor? 
 NOVICE HAME : The rest of Boe-kind became extinct. Long ago. He's the only one left. Legend says that the Face of Boe has watched the universe grow old. 
 The Doctor smiles. 
 NOVICE HAME (CONT'D) : There's all sorts of superstitions around him. One story says that just before his death, the Face of Boe will impart his great secret. That he will speak those words only to one like himself. 
 THE DOCTOR : What does that mean? 
 NOVICE HAME : It's just a story. 
 THE DOCTOR : Tell me the rest. 
 NOVICE HAME : It's said he'll talk to a wanderer. To the man without a home. 
 The Doctor recognizes himself in this sentence. 
 NOVICE HAME (CONT'D) : The lonely God. 
 INT. HOSPITAL BASEMENT 
 Cassandra is still stood in front of the mirror looking at Rose's body, absolutely horrified. 
 CASSANDRA-ROSE   (frantic):  Look at me! From class to brass! Although... 
 She pulls the zipper of Rose's jacket down slightly and runs her hands over her body. 
 CASSANDRA-ROSE (CONT'D) : Oh... curves... oh, baby... 
 She bounces up and down, Chip following suit. 
 CASSANDRA-ROSE   (CONT'D)   (delighted):  It's like living inside a bouncy castle! 
 CHIP : Mistress is beautiful! 
 CASSANDRA-ROSE : Absolutement! Oh, but look... 
 Her eye is caught by Cassandra's old frame, which is empty. 
 CHIP   (sad surprise):  Oh...! The brain lead expired... my old mistress is gone. 
 CASSANDRA-ROSE : But safe and sound in here. 
 She taps her head. 
 CHIP : What of the Rose child's mind? 
 CASSANDRA-ROSE : Oh... tucked away... I can just about access the surface memory, she's... 
 She pauses to think. 
 CASSANDRA-ROSE (CONT'D) : Gosh... she's with the Doctor... a man... he's the Doctor... the same Doctor with a new face! That hypocrite! I must get the name of his surgeon. 
 She turns on her heel to look in the mirror again. 
 CASSANDRA-ROSE (CONT'D) : I could do with a little work. Although... 
 She runs her hand over Rose's bum. 
 CASSANDRA-ROSE (CONT'D) : Nice rear bumper. Hmm! 
 She smiles. Rose's mobile rings. 
 CASSANDRA-ROSE (CONT'D) : Oh... it seems to be ringing... is it meant to ring? 
 She pulls Rose's phone out of her back pocket and stares at it. 
 CHIP : A primitive communications device. 
 Cassandra presses a button and the Doctor's voice is on the other end. 
 THE DOCTOR   (over the phone):  Rose, where are you? 
 CASSANDRA-ROSE   (whispering, placing the phone to her ear):  How does she speak? 
 CHIP   (whispering back):  Old Earth Cockney. 
 CASSANDRA-ROSE   (into mobile):  Uhm... wotcha... 
 INT. WARD 26 
 THE DOCTOR : Where've you been? How long does it take to get to Ward 26? 
 CASSANDRA-ROSE   (over the phone, forced voice):  I'm on my way, governor. 
 INT. HOSPITAL BASEMENT 
 CASSANDRA-ROSE   (CONT'D) : I shall proceed up the Apples and Pears. 
 INT. WARD 26 
 THE DOCTOR : You'll never guess. I'm with the Face of Boe! Remember him? 
 INT. HOSPITAL BASEMENT 
 CASSANDRA-ROSE   (laughs, through gritted teeth):  Course I do... that big old... boat... race... 
 INT. WARD 26 
 THE DOCTOR   (distracted by something happening at the Duke's bed):  I'd better go. See you in a minute. 
 He replaces the receiver. The Duke is laughing. He and Frau Clovis both have a glass of champagne. 
 DUKE : Didn't think I was going to make it! 
 The Doctor steps into view. 
 DUKE (CONT'D) : It's that man again! 
 The Doctor smiles, scratching his ear absent-mindedly. 
 DUKE (CONT'D) : He's my good luck charm! Come in! Don't be shy! 
 FRAU CLOVIS : Any friendship expressed by the Duke of Manhattan does not constitute a form of legal contract. 
 The Doctor nods. 
 DUKE : Winch me up. 
 He gives the Doctor the thumbs up. Frau Clovis presses a button on a remote and the bed tilts forwards. 
 DUKE (CONT'D) : Ah! Look at me! No sign of infection! 
 WAITER   (to the Doctor):  Champagne, sir? 
 THE DOCTOR : No thanks. Uh... you had Petrifold Regression, right? 
 DUKE   (happily):  That being the operative word! Past tense! Completely cured. 
 He laughs joyfully. 
 THE DOCTOR : But that's impossible. 
 MATRON CASP : Primitive species would accuse us of magic, but it's merely the tender application of science. 
 THE DOCTOR   (staring at her):  How on Earth did you cure him? 
 MATRON CASP : How on New Earth, you might say. 
 THE DOCTOR   (nodding to the drip):  What's in that solution? 
 MATRON CASP : A simple remedy. 
 THE DOCTOR   (challenging her):  Then tell me what it is. 
 MATRON CASP : I'm sorry. Patient confidentiality. I don't believe we've met. My name is Matron Casp. 
 THE DOCTOR : I'm the Doctor. 
 MATRON CASP : I think you'll find that we're the Doctors here. 
 SISTER JATT   (to Matron Casp):  Matron Casp... you're needed in intensive care. 
 MATRON CASP   (to the Doctor):  If you would excuse me. 
 The Doctor nods to her and she leaves with Sister Jatt. He watches them walk away. 
 SISTER JATT   (quietly):  It's happened again. One of the patients is conscious. 
 MATRON CASP : Oh... we can't have that... 
 The Doctor watches them suspiciously. 
 INT. HOSPITAL BASEMENT 
 CHIP : This Doctor man is dangerous. 
 Cassandra-Rose flicks her hair back, fixing herself up in the mirror. 
 CASSANDRA-ROSE : Dangerous and clever. I might need a mind like his. The Sisterhood is up to something. Remember that Old Earth saying...? Never trust a Nun. Never trust a Nurse. And never trust a cat. Perfume? 
 Chip takes a small tube of perfume out of his pocket and gives it to her. She pushes it down her cleavage. She then strides out of the room with purpose. 
 INT. INTENSIVE CARE 
 Sister Jatt and Matron Casp pass luminous green doors in intensive care. 
 SISTER JATT : It was having a perfectly normal blood-wash. And all of a sudden, it started crying. It's this one. 
 They open one of the doors and look inside. Diseased hands reach out to them. 
 PATIENT : Please... 
 SISTER JATT : Look at its eyes. So alive. 
 MATRON CASP : Positively sparkling! 
 PATIENT : Please... where am I? 
 MATRON CASP : And speech! How can it even have a vocabulary? 
 SISTER JATT : Sister Corvin's written a thesis on the migration of sentients. She calls it: The Echo of Life. It's well worth a read. 
 PATIENT : Help me... 
 MATRON CASP   (disgusted):  I've seen enough, thank you. 
 They shut the door and walk away. 
 MATRON CASP (CONT'D) : If this happens again, we might have to review our brain stem policy. 
 SISTER JATT : And what should we do with the patient? 
 MATRON CASP   (dismissively):  Standard proceedure. Incinerate. 
 Matron Casp rounds a corner. Sister Jatt pulls a lever on the wall, and there is a terrible scream from the patient's cell as it glows white. She leaves. 
 INT. WARD 26 
 Cassandra-Rose finally emerges onto Ward 26, still smoothing down her hair. She spots the Doctor examining various drips, with his glasses on. She smiles when he notices her. 
 THE DOCTOR : There you are! Come and look at this patient! 
 He takes her arm and shows her a patient whose skin is completely red. 
 THE DOCTOR (CONT'D)   (taking his glasses off):  Marconi's Disease. Should take years to recover. Two days. I've never seen anything like it... they've invented a cell washing cascade... it's amazing. Their medical science is way advanced. And this one! 
 He leads her to another bed sporting a man who is completely white. 
 THE DOCTOR (CONT'D) : Pallidome Pancrosis. Kills you in ten minutes, and he's fine! 
 He waves cheerily to the patient. 
 THE DOCTOR (CONT'D) : I need to find a terminal. I've got to see how they do this. 
 They walk off, Rose walking rather differently. 
 THE DOCTOR (CONT'D) : Because if they've got the best medicine in the world... then why's it such a secret? 
 CASSANDRA-ROSE   (stopping):  I can't Adam and Eve it. 
 THE DOCTOR   (confused):  What's... what's with the voice? 
 CASSANDRA-ROSE   (looking up at him):  Oh, I don't know... just larking about New Earth... New me... 
 She looks him up and down. He finally seems to notice that most of the buttons on her shirt are undone. 
 THE DOCTOR : Well, I can talk. New New Doctor. 
 He grins. 
 CASSANDRA-ROSE : Mmm... aren't you just... 
 She very suddenly pulls his face towards her and plants a smacking kiss on his lips. When she finally pulls away, he looks extremely shocked and she's slightly breathless. He stares at her. 
 CASSANDRA-ROSE (CONT'D) : T... terminal's this way. 
 She walks off, exhaling slightly. He watches her go looking extremely dazed and tousled. 
 THE DOCTOR   (high-pitched):  Yep... still got it... 
 He follows her, smoothing his hair down. 
 INT. HOSPITAL 
 The Doctor and Cassandra/Rose are looking at details of the hospital on a screen. 
 THE DOCTOR : Nope... nothing odd... surgery... post-op... nano-dentistry... no sign of a shop... they should have a shop. 
 CASSANDRA-ROSE   (walking around him):  No, it's missing something else. When I was downstairs, those Nurse / Cat / Nuns were talking about Intensive Care. Where is it...? 
 THE DOCTOR : You're right, well done. 
 CASSANDRA-ROSE : Why would they hide a whole department? 
 The Doctor takes his sonic screwdriver out of his pocket. 
 CASSANDRA-ROSE (CONT'D) : It's gotta be there somewhere. Search the sub-frame. 
 THE DOCTOR : What if the sub-frame's locked? 
 CASSANDRA-ROSE : Try the installation protocol... 
 THE DOCTOR   (scanning screen):  Yeah, course. Sorry. Hold on. 
 He clicks his sonic screwdriver off and the entire wall moves downwards, revealing a secret corridor behind. Cassandra/Rose smiles and walks straight into it. The Doctor follows, knowing something isn't quite right about her. 
 THE DOCTOR (CONT'D) : Intensive Care. Certainly looks intensive. 
 Behind them, Novice Hame watches them enter the corridor. She follows. 
 INT. INTENSIVE CARE 
 The Doctor and Cassandra-Rose go down metal steps into Intensive Care. They find themselves in the huge cavernous chamber, looking upon row and row of green doors. The Doctor walks along one of the rows and opens a door with his sonic screwdriver. A man, covered in boils and surrounded by smoke looks back at them. 
 CASSANDRA-ROSE : That's disgusting. What's wrong with him? 
 THE DOCTOR   (to the man, horrified):  I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. 
 Cassandra-Rose holds her nose whilst the Doctor closes the door gently. He opens another. 
 CASSANDRA-ROSE   (looking at the woman inside):  What disease is that? 
 THE DOCTOR   (quietly, disgusted):  All of them. Every single disease in the galaxy, they've been infected with everything. 
 CASSANDRA-ROSE : What about us? Are we safe? 
 THE DOCTOR : The air's sterile. Just don't touch them. 
 He shuts the door and then leans over the railing, looking upon the rows of doors. Cassandra-Rose follows. 
 CASSANDRA-ROSE : How many patients are there? 
 THE DOCTOR : They're not patients. 
 CASSANDRA-ROSE : But they're sick. 
 THE DOCTOR   (angry):  They were born sick. They're meant to be sick. They exist to be sick. Lab rats. No wonder the Sisters have got a cure for everything. They've built the ultimate research laboratory. A Human farm. 
 CASSANDRA-ROSE : Why don't they just die? 
 THE DOCTOR : Plague carriers. The last to go. 
 NOVICE HAME   (appearing at the end of the row):  It's for the greater cause. 
 THE DOCTOR : Novice Hame. When you took your vows, did you agree to this? 
 NOVICE HAME : The Sisterhood has sworn to help. 
 THE DOCTOR   (shouting):  What, by killing? 
 NOVICE HAME   (gently):  But they're not real people. They're specially grown. They have no proper existence. 
 THE DOCTOR   (advancing dangerously):  What's the turnover? Hm? Thousand a day? Thousand the next? Thousand the next? How many thousand? For how many years? How many? 
 NOVICE HAME : Mankind needed us. They came to this planet with so many illnesses. We couldn't cope. We did try. We tried everything. We tried using clone-meat and bio-cattle... but the results were too slow. So the sisterhood grew its own flesh. That's all they are. Flesh. 
 THE DOCTOR : These people are alive. 
 NOVICE HAME : But think of those Humans out there... healthy... and happy, because of us. 
 THE DOCTOR : If they live because of this, then life is worthless. 
 NOVICE HAME : But who are you to decide that? 
 THE DOCTOR   (stepping forward):  I'm the Doctor. And if you don't like it... if you want to take it to a higher authority, then there isn't one. It stops with me. 
 CASSANDRA-ROSE   (peering over the Doctor's shoulder):  Just to confirm... none of the Humans in the city actually know about this? 
 NOVICE HAME : We thought it best not... 
 THE DOCTOR : Hold on. I can understand the bodies. I can understand your vows. But one thing I can't understand... what have you done to Rose? 
 NOVICE HAME : I don't know what you mean. 
 THE DOCTOR   (deadly quiet):  And I'm being very, very calm. You wanna beware of that... very, very calm. And the only reason I'm being so very, very calm is that the brain is a delicate thing. Whatever you've done to Rose's head, I want it reversed. 
 NOVICE HAME : We haven't done anything. 
 CASSANDRA-ROSE : I'm perfectly fine. 
 THE DOCTOR   (to Novice Hame):  These people are dying, and Rose would care. 
 CASSANDRA-ROSE : Oh, all right, clever clogs. 
 She spins him around to face her. 
 CASSANDRA-ROSE   (CONT'D)   (pulling his tie out flirtatiously):  Smarty pants.  (Huskily).  Lady-killer. 
 THE DOCTOR : What's happened to you? 
 CASSANDRA-ROSE : I knew something was going on in this hospital, but I needed this body and your mind to find it out. 
 THE DOCTOR : Who are you? 
 Cassandra/Rose stands on tip toes to whisper into the Doctor's ear. 
 CASSANDRA-ROSE : The Last Human. 
 THE DOCTOR   (pulling back, unpleasantly surprised):  Cassandra? 
 CASSANDRA-ROSE : Wake up and smell the perfume. 
 She takes the tube of perfume and skirts it in the Doctor's face. He immediately keels over, unconscious. 
 NOVICE HAME   (kneeling at his side):  You've hurt him! I don't understand... I'll have to fetch Matron! 
 CASSANDRA-ROSE : You do that, 'cause I want to see her. Now, run along! Sound the alarm! 
 Novice Hame hurries off. Cassandra-Rose rips a cable out and an alarm goes off. She smiles, satisfied. 
 INT. HOSPITAL 
 Novice Hame emerges from Intensive Care and meets Matron Casp and Sister Jatt going in. 
 NOVICE HAME   (scared):  Matron! It's that man. And the girl! 
 MATRON CASP : We heard the alarm, now get back to work. Tend to your patients. 
 Novice Hame hurries off and Matron Casp and Sister Jatt walk into Intensive Care. 
 INT. INTENSIVE CARE 
 The Doctor wakes up and finds himself inside one of the cells in Intensive Care. 
 THE DOCTOR : Let me out! Let me out! 
 CASSANDRA-ROSE   (looks through door):  Aren't you lucky there was a spare? Standing room only. 
 THE DOCTOR : You've stolen Rose's body. 
 CASSANDRA-ROSE : Over the years, I've thought of a thousand ways to kill you, Doctor. And now, that's exactly what I've got. One thousand diseases. They pump the patients with a top-up every ten minutes. You've got about... three minutes left. Enjoy. 
 THE DOCTOR : Just let Rose go, Cassandra. 
 CASSANDRA-ROSE : I will! As soon as I've found someone younger and... less common... then I'll junk her with the waste. Now hushaby! It's showtime. 
 Matron Casp and Sister Jatt approach Cassandra-Rose. 
 SISTER JATT : Anything we can do to help? 
 CASSANDRA-ROSE : Straight to the point, Whiskers... I want money. 
 MATRON CASP : The Sisterhood is a charity. We don't give money. We only... accept. 
 CASSANDRA-ROSE : The Humans across the water pay you a fortune. And that's exactly what I need. A one-off payment. That's all I want... oh, and perhaps a yacht. In return for which, I shall tell the City nothing of your institutional murder. Is that a deal? 
 Sister Jatt presses a few buttons on a remote. 
 MATRON CASP : I'm afraid not. 
 CASSANDRA-ROSE : I'd really advise you to think about this. 
 MATRON CASP : There's no need. I have to decline. 
 CASSANDRA-ROSE : I'll tell them! And you've no way of stopping me! You're not exactly Nuns with Guns... you're not even armed. 
 MATRON CASP : Who needs arms when we have claws? 
 Her claws shoot out of her paws and she hisses menacingly. 
 CASSANDRA-ROSE : Well, nice try. 
 She spins around to call to Chip who is waiting nearby. 
 CASSANDRA-ROSE : Chip? Plan B! 
 Chip pulls a lever and every cell door on the row springs open. The Doctor steps out of his cell, and also the infected people. 
 THE DOCTOR   (yelling):  What've you done?? 
 CASSANDRA-ROSE : Gave the system a shot of adrenaline, just to wake 'em up. See ya! 
 She runs off. 
 THE DOCTOR : Don't touch them! 
 He calls back to the nurses. 
 THE DOCTOR (CONT'D) : Whatever you do, don't touch! 
 He dashes after Cassandra/Rose and Chip. The infected people walk zombie-like up to Sister Jatt and Matron Casp. 
 SISTER JATT : I think we should withdraw. 
 MAN : We understood what you did to us. As part of the machine, we know the machine. 
 MATRON CASP   (backing away):  Fascinating. It's actually constructing an argument. 
 MAN : And we... will end it. 
 He plunges his hands into the electrics, electrocuting himself to death but causing every single cell door in Intensive Care to explode open. Cassandra-Rose screams as she, the Doctor and Chip run for their lives along the row. The infected people start to leave their cells. 
 SISTER JATT   (looking over the railings, horrified):  They're free. By the Goddess Centauri... the flesh is free! 
 The zombies stagger slowly towards them, muttering: stop the pain..., reaching out to them. Sister Jatt is backed against the wall and one of the people touches her. She immediately breaks out in boils, screaming with pain. The Doctor, Cassandra-Rose and Chip pause for a moment and watch all the zombies break out of their cells. 
 CASSANDRA-ROSE : Oh, my God... 
 THE DOCTOR : What the hell have you done? 
 CASSANDRA-ROSE : It wasn't me! 
 THE DOCTOR : One touch and you get every disease in the world, and I want that body safe, Cassandra! We've gotta go down! 
 The zombies are advancing. 
 CASSANDRA-ROSE   (scared):  But there's thousands of them! 
 THE DOCTOR : Run! Down! Down! Go down! 
 They run down the stairs. Matron Casp picks up a phone. 
 MATRON CASP : Quarantine the building! 
 She hangs up and runs. 
 PA : This building is under quarantine. 
 INT. HOSPITAL LOBBY 
 Shutters seal off every entrance and exit to the hospital, causing alarm amongst the patients, staff and visitors. 
 PA(CONT'D) : Repeat... this building is under quarantine. No one may leave the premises. Repeat... 
 EXT. NEW EARTH HOSPITAL 
 The PA is booming out over the landscape. 
 PA (CONT'D) : ... no one may leave the premises. 
 INT. INTENSIVE CARE 
 The zombies follow the Doctor, Cassandra-Rose and Chip down the stairs, arms outstretched. 
 THE DOCTOR : Keep going! Go down! 
 INT. HOSPITAL 
 The door to Intensive Care opens and the zombies reach out into the hospital. They grab onto a woman's arm, whispering: help us, stay with us... She screams. 
 WOMAN : Help me! 
 Her skin breaks out into boils. 
 INT. HOSPITAL BASEMENT 
 Cassandra-Rose, Chip and the Doctor descend the last flight of stairs and burst through a door into the cellar. Cassandra/Rose frantically tries to operate the lifts. 
 THE DOCTOR   (stopping):  No, the lifts have closed down. That's the quarantine, nothing's moving. 
 CASSANDRA-ROSE : This way! 
 She runs the other way, the Doctor on her heel. More of the infected people are beginning to spill out from converging corridor. Chip is left behind. He whimpers. 
 THE DOCTOR   (beginning to go back):  Someone will touch him! 
 CASSANDRA /- ROSE   (grabbing his arm):  Leave him! He's just a clone thing, he's only got a half life... come on! 
 CHIP   (calling pitifully):  Mistress! 
 Cassandra-Rose is already running in the opposite direction. 
 THE DOCTOR   (calling to Chip):  I'm sorry, I can't let her escape! 
 He runs after her, out of sight. 
 CHIP   (terrified):  My Mistress! 
 The infected people advance on him. Whimpering, he runs back in the direction he came from and jumps down the waste chute. 
 INT. WARD 26 
 Frau Clovis emerges through some sliding doors. 
 FRAU CLOVIS   (irritated):  Excuse me...! Can we get some service? 
 She looks helplessly around the empty room. She sees the opening to Intensive Care and the zombies emerging from it, screams, presses the alarm and runs in the opposite direction. 
 INT. HOSPITAL BASEMENT 
 The Doctor and Cassandra-Rose rush back into the room where Rose met Cassandra, slamming the door behind them. Cassandra-Rose tries another door but seeing the zombies all clambering to get in behind it, slams it shut again. 
 CASSANDRA-ROSE   (upset and scared):  We're trapped! What're we going to do? 
 THE DOCTOR   (angrily):  Well, for starters, you're going to leave that body. 
 He gestures up at the psychograft with his sonic screwdriver. 
 THE DOCTOR (CONT'D) : That psychograft is banned on every civilized planet! You're compressing Rose to death. 
 CASSANDRA-ROSE : But I've got nowhere to go. My original skin's dead. 
 THE DOCTOR  : Not my problem. You can float as atoms in the air. Now, get out. 
 He points his sonic screwdriver at her threateningly. 
 THE DOCTOR (CONT'D) : Give her back to me. 
 CASSANDRA-ROSE : You asked for it. 
 Cassandra, as a cloud of light, leaps from Rose's body into the Doctors. 
 ROSE   (disorientated):  Blimey, my head... 
 She looks around the room. 
 ROSE (CONT'D) : Where'd she go...? 
 CASSANDRA-THE DOCTOR   (very camp):  Oh, my. This is... different. 
 ROSE : Cassandra? 
 CASSANDRA-THE DOCTOR : Goodness me, I'm a man. Yum. So many parts! And hardly used... 
 Cassandra-the Doctor wiggles around crazily. 
 CASSANDRA-THE DOCTOR (CONT'D) : Ah.. ah! Two hearts! Oh, baby, I'm beating out a samba! 
 ROSE : Get out of him. 
 CASSANDRA-THE DOCTOR   (running a hand down his body):  Ooh, he's slim. And a little bit foxy. 
 He raises his eyebrows at Rose. 
 CASSANDRA-THE DOCTOR (CONT'D) : You've thought so too. I've been inside your head... 
 Rose looks sheepish because it's true. 
 CASSANDRA-THE DOCTOR   (CONT'D)   (coming closer teasingly):  You've been looking... you like it. 
 The zombie people suddenly burst through the doors making them both jump. 
 CASSANDRA-THE DOCTOR   (CONT'D)   (frantically):  What do we do? What would he do?? The Doctor... What the hell would he do?! 
 ROSE   (spinning around and noticing a ladder):  Ladder... we've gotta get up. 
 Cassandra-the Doctor shoves Rose roughly out of the way to get to the ladder first. 
 CASSANDRA-THE DOCTOR :  Out of the way, Blondie!  
 The zombies come even closer. Rose hurriedly follows Cassandra-the Doctor up the ladder. 
 INT. WARD 26 
 The zombies are pressed against a glass window, trying to get through into the ward whilst patients, staff and visitors alike try to stop them. 
 INT. INTENSIVE CARE 
 Chip is back in Intensive Care, zombies approaching from both directions. He whimpers and backs into one of the cells, shutting the door on himself. 
 INT. STAIRWELL 
 ROSE   (climbing the ladder behind Cassandra-the Doctor):  If you get out of the Doctor's body, he can think of something. 
 CASSANDRA-THE DOCTOR : Yap yap yap... God, it was tedious inside your head. Hormone City. 
 ROSE : We're gonna die if... 
 She screams as Matron Casp grabs her ankle. 
 ROSE (CONT'D) : Get off! 
 MATRON CASP : All our good work! All that healing! 
 Cassandra-the Doctor rolls his eyes. 
 MATRON CASP (CONT'D) : The good name of the Sisterhood... you have destroyed everything! 
 CASSANDRA-THE DOCTOR   (dismissively):  Go and play with a ball of string. 
 MATRON CASP : Everywhere... disease! This is the Human World. Sickness! 
 A diseased hand grabs Matron Casp's ankle. She wails in pain and breaks out into boils. She falls down the lift shaft, wailing. After watching her fall, the zombie people start to climb the ladder again. 
 ROSE : Move! 
 Cassandra-the Doctor whimpers and hastily starts to climb the ladder again. 
 PA : Maximum quarantine. Divert all shuttles. 
 They get to the top of the ladder and find the lift doors are sealed. 
 CASSANDRA-THE DOCTOR : Now what do we do? 
 ROSE : Use the sonic screwdriver. 
 Cassandra-the Doctor takes it out of his pocket between his thumb and forefinger with his nose wrinkled. 
 CASSANDRA-THE DOCTOR : You mean this thing? 
 ROSE : Yes, I mean that thing. 
 CASSANDRA-THE DOCTOR : Well, I don't know how... that Doctor's hidden away all his thoughts. 
 ROSE : Cassandra, go back into me... the Doctor can open it. Do it! 
 CASSANDRA-THE DOCTOR : Hold on tight. 
 Cassandra leaps back into Rose. 
 CASSANDRA-ROSE : Oh... oh, chavtastic again. Open it! 
 THE DOCTOR   (pointing his sonic screwdriver at her):  Not 'til you get out of her. 
 CASSANDRA-ROSE : We need the Doctor. 
 THE DOCTOR   (shouting angrily):  I order you to leave her! 
 Cassandra leaps back into the Doctor. 
 CASSANDRA-THE DOCTOR : No matter how difficult the situation, there is no need to shout. 
 ROSE : Cassandra, get out of him! 
 CASSANDRA-THE DOCTOR : But I can't go into you, he simply refuses... he's so rude. 
 ROSE : I don't care. Just do something. 
 CASSANDRA-THE DOCTOR   (disgusted, reluctant):  Oh, I am so gonna regret this... 
 Cassandra leaps from the Doctor's body into a diseased woman's body. 
 CASSANDRA-ZOMBIE : Oh, sweet Lord... I look disgusting. 
 The Doctor opens the lift doors and holds out a hand to Rose. 
 THE DOCTOR : Nice to have you back. 
 CASSANDRA / ZOMBIE : No you don't... 
 She leaps back into Rose, who is crouched on the floor. 
 THE DOCTOR   (sealing the doors):  That was your last warning, Cassandra! 
 Cassandra-Rose stares into space. 
 CASSANDRA / ROSE   (quietly):  Inside her head... they're so alone... they keep reaching out, just to hold us... all their lives and they've never been touched. 
 The Doctor holds out a hand, which Cassandra-Rose takes. He pulls her to her feet. The diseased people bang on the lift doors. The Doctor and Cassandra/Rose walk off, through a door which leads back onto Ward 26. 
 INT. WARD 26 
 Frau Clovis brandishes a chair at them menacingly, roaring like a wild animal. 
 THE DOCTOR : We're safe! We're safe! We're safe. We're clean! We're clean! Look, look... 
 FRAU CLOVIS : Show me your skin. 
 THE DOCTOR   (showing her):  Look! Clean. Look... if we'd been touched, we'd be dead. 
 Frau Clovis nods and puts the chair down. 
 THE DOCTOR (CONT'D) : So, how's it going up here? What's the status? 
 FRAU CLOVIS : There's nothing but silence from the other wards. I think we're the only ones left. And I've been trying to override the quarantine. 
 She fiddles with a small device she is holding. 
 FRAU CLOVIS (CONT'D) : If I can trip a signal over to New New York, they can send a private executive squad. 
 THE DOCTOR : You can't do that. If they forced entry, they'd break quarantine. 
 FRAU CLOVIS   (angrily):  I am not dying in here. 
 THE DOCTOR : We can't let a single particle of disease get out... there is ten million people in that City, they'd all be at risk! Now, turn that off! 
 FRAU CLOVIS : Not if it gets me out. 
 THE DOCTOR : All right, fine. So I have to stop you lot as well. Suits me. Rose. Novice Hame. Everyone! Excuse me your grace... get me intravenous solutions for every single disease. Move it! 
 Everyone gathers all the solutions. The Doctor ties a rope around his body and Cassandra-Rose attaches the solutions to it so they hang off him. 
 THE DOCTOR (CONT'D) : How's that? Will that do? 
 CASSANDRA-ROSE : I don't know! Will it do for what? 
 The Doctor opens the doors to the lift with his sonic screwdriver. 
 CASSANDRA-ROSE (CONT'D) : The lifts aren't working. 
 The Doctor peers down the shaft. 
 THE DOCTOR : Not moving. Different thing. 
 He steps right back, ready for a running jump. 
 THE DOCTOR (CONT'D) : Here we go. 
 He sticks the sonic screwdriver between his teeth and runs. 
 CASSANDRA-ROSE : But you're not going to... 
 He jumps into the middle of the shaft and clings onto the rope. 
 CASSANDRA-ROSE (CONT'D) : What do you think you're doing?! 
 THE DOCTOR : I'm going down! 
 He fixes up the wench with his sonic screwdriver. Cassandra-Rose looks away, exasperated. 
 THE DOCTOR (CONT'D) : Come on! 
 CASSANDRA-ROSE : Not in a million years. 
 THE DOCTOR : I need another pair of hands. What do you think? If you're so desperate to stay alive... Why don't you live a little? 
 More zombies emerge from the quarantine. 
 FRAU CLOVIS : Seal the door! 
 INT. LIFT SHAFT 
 The doors close, leaving Cassandra/Rose trapped with the zombies and no choice but to jump into the lift shaft and onto the Doctor's back with a regretful moan. 
 CASSANDRA-ROSE : You're completely mad. I can see why she likes you. 
 THE DOCTOR : Going down! 
 They whizz down the shaft, screaming. They straighten themselves out when they reach the bottom. 
 CASSANDRA-ROSE : Well, that's one way to lose weight. 
 THE DOCTOR : Now, listen... when I say so, take hold of that lever. 
 CASSANDRA-ROSE : There's still a quarantine down there, we can't... 
 THE DOCTOR   (shouts):  Hold that lever! 
 Cassandra-Rose backs down. 
 THE DOCTOR : I'm cooking up a cocktail. I know a bit about medicine myself. 
 He rips the tops of the packets of each solution with his teeth and skirts them into the clear container where the disinfectant for the lift should go. 
 THE DOCTOR (CONT'D) : Now, that lever's going to resist. But keep it in position. 
 He opens a trapdoor in the top of the lift. 
 THE DOCTOR (CONT'D) : Hold onto it with everything you've got. 
 CASSANDRA-ROSE : What about you? 
 THE DOCTOR : I've got an appointment. The Doctor is in. 
 He drops down into the lift. He opens the doors with his sonic screwdriver. Beyond, are all the infected people huddled in groups. When they see him, they start to come towards him. 
 THE DOCTOR (CONT'D) : I'm in here, come on! 
 CASSANDRA-ROSE : Don't tell them! 
 THE DOCTOR : Pull that lever! 
 The infected people stagger towards the lift. 
 THE DOCTOR (CONT'D) : Come and get me, come on! I'm in here, come on! 
 They reach out to him. 
 SPEAKER : Commence stage one... disinfection. 
 THE DOCTOR : Hurry up, come on! 
 He beckons them towards him. The solution showers into the lift, soaking him. 
 THE DOCTOR (CONT'D) : Come on, come on. 
 The infected people stumble into the shower and are also socked with the medicine. 
 THE DOCTOR (CONT'D)   (enthusiastically):  All they wanna do is pass it on. Pass it on! 
 CASSANDRA-ROSE   (confused):  Pass on what? Pass on what?! 
 THE DOCTOR : Pass it on! 
 The infected people touch each other, and pass on their good health. The boils begin to disappear. The Doctor grins manically. Cassandra/Rose jumps down into the lift with the Doctor's help. 
 CASSANDRA-ROSE : What did they pass on? Did you kill them? All of them? 
 THE DOCTOR : No. That's your way of doing things. 
 He walks into their midst. 
 THE DOCTOR (CONT'D) : I'm the Doctor and I cured them. 
 The new humans look around at their surroundings, slightly child-like. A woman comes up to the Doctor and hugs him. 
 THE DOCTOR   (CONT'D)   (gently):  That's right! Hey, hey! There we go, sweetheart! Ay? Look at him... 
 He ushers her off to sit with someone. 
 THE DOCTOR (CONT'D) : Go on, that's it! That's it! It's a new sub-species, Cassandra! 
 He takes a man by the shoulders and looks at him. 
 THE DOCTOR (CONT'D) : A brand new form of life! New Humans! Look at them, look! 
 He bends down to look at them with a huge smile on his face. 
 THE DOCTOR (CONT'D) : Grown by cats... kept in the dark, fed by tubes... but completely, completely alive! 
 He points at Cassandra-Rose 
 THE DOCTOR (CONT'D) : You can't deny them, because you helped create them. 
 Cassandra-Rose rolls her eyes. 
 THE DOCTOR (CONT'D) : The human race just keeps on going. Keeps on changing. Life will out! Ha! 
 EXT. NEW EARTH HOSPITAL 
 Shuttles zoom towards the hospital. 
 LOUDSPEAKER : This is the NNYPD. Please step away from the shuttles. 
 INT. WARD 26 
 The hospital is swarming with police officers when the Doctor (still wet and in shirtsleeves) and Cassandra-Rose emerge back onto the ward. 
 PA : All staff will present themselves to the officers for immediate arrest. I repeat... immediate arrest. All new life forms will be catalogued and taken into care. 
 Novice Hame is lead away by a police officer. She catches the Doctor's eye. He does not smile. 
 PA (CONT'D) : All visitors to the hospital will be required to make a statement to the NNYPD. 
 THE DOCTOR   (suddenly remembering):  Face of Boe! 
 He dashes off again. Cassandra/Rose rolls her eyes before following. 
 INT. WARD 26 (CONT'D) 
 The Doctor approaches the Face of Boe who looks very much alive and well. 
 THE DOCTOR   (smiling):  You were supposed to be dying. 
 FACE OF BOE   (through telepathy):  There are better things to do today. Dying can wait. 
 CASSANDRA-ROSE : Oh, I hate telepathy. Just what I need, a head full of big face. 
 THE DOCTOR : Shh! 
 FACE OF BOE : I have grown tired with the universe, Doctor, but you have taught me to look at it anew. 
 THE DOCTOR   (kneeling before him):  There are legends you know, saying that you're millions of years old. 
 FACE OF BOE   (laughs slightly):  There are? That would be impossible. 
 THE DOCTOR : Wouldn't it just? I got the impression... there was something you wanted to tell me... 
 FACE OF BOE : A great secret. 
 THE DOCTOR : So the legend says. 
 FACE OF BOE : It can wait. 
 THE DOCTOR   (put out):  Oh, does it have to? 
 FACE OF BOE : We shall meet again, Doctor, for the third time... for the last time... and the truth shall be told. Until that day... 
 He teleports himself away. 
 THE DOCTOR   (very impressed):  That is enigmatic. That... that is... that is textbook enigmatic. 
 He nods to himself, and then stands to face at Cassandra-Rose, who has been examining her nails, completely disinterested in the proceedings. 
 THE DOCTOR (CONT'D) : And now for you. 
 CASSANDRA-ROSE : But... everything's happy. Everything's fine... can't you just leave me? 
 THE DOCTOR : You've lived long enough. Leave that body and end it, Cassandra. 
 CASSANDRA-ROSE   (starting to cry):  I don't want to die! 
 THE DOCTOR : No one does. 
 CASSANDRA-ROSE : Help me! 
 THE DOCTOR : I can't. 
 Chip appears, making Cassandra-Rose gasp. 
 CHIP : Mistress! 
 CASSANDRA-ROSE : Ah! You're alive! 
 CHIP : I kept myself safe. For you, mistress. 
 CASSANDRA-ROSE   (staring at Chip, cogs ticking...):  A body... and not just that, a volunteer... 
 THE DOCTOR   (warningly):  Don't you dare. He's got a life of his own. 
 CHIP : But I worship the mistress! 
 Cassandra-Rose winks at Chip. 
 CHIP (CONT'D) : I welcome her. 
 THE DOCTOR : You can't, Cassandra, you... 
 Cassandra ignores him and leaps into Chip's body. Rose falls forward with a gasp, and the Doctor lunges to catch her. 
 THE DOCTOR (CONT'D) : Oh! You all right? 
 Rose pauses and loses her balance again. 
 THE DOCTOR (CONT'D) : Whoa! Okay? 
 ROSE : Yeah... 
 Rose finally get her bearings and gathers herself together... and finds herself staring right at the Doctor. She smiles. 
 ROSE (CONT'D) : Hello! 
 THE DOCTOR   (smiling):  Hello. Welcome back. 
 Rose gazes up at him, smiling, when they are distracted again by Cassandra. 
 CASSANDRA-CHIP : Oh, sweet Lord. I'm a walking doodle. 
 THE DOCTOR : You can't stay in there. I'm sorry, Cassandra, but that's not fair. I can take you to the City. They can build you a skin tank and you can stand trial for what you've done. 
 CASSANDRA-CHIP : Well, that would be rather dramatic. Possibly my finest hour. And certainly my finest hat. 
 The Doctor and Rose glance at each other. 
 CASSANDRA-CHIP (CONT'D) : But I'm afraid we don't have time. Poor little Chip is only a half-life. And he's been through so much. His heart is racing so. He's failing. I don't think he's going to last... 
 His legs give way. Rose and the Doctor lunge forward to support him. 
 THE DOCTOR : You all right? 
 CASSANDRA-CHIP : I'm fine. 
 He pauses. The Doctor and Rose stare at him in concern. 
 CASSANDRA-CHIP(CONT'D) : I'm dying. But that's fine. 
 THE DOCTOR   (calmly):  I can take you to the City. 
 CASSANDRA-CHIP : No, you won't. Everything's new on this planet. There's no place for Chip and me anymore. You're right, Doctor. It's time to die. 
 Rose looks rather upset. Cassandra-Chip swallows. 
 CASSANDRA-CHIP (CONT'D) : And that's good. 
 The Doctor and Rose help him to his feet. 
 THE DOCTOR : Come on. There's one last thing I can do. 
 They lead him away. 
 INT. PARTY 
 The TARDIS engines sound. The Doctor steps out of the doors, followed by Cassandra-Chip and Rose. He has landed at the place on the tape Cassandra was playing, at the party. Cassandra, as a proper human being is laughing and talking, the life and soul of the party. Cassandra/Chip turns to the Doctor. 
 CASSANDRA-CHIP : Thank you. 
 THE DOCTOR : Just go. And don't look back. 
 ROSE : Good luck. 
 Cassandra-Chip walks into the midst of the party, up to Cassandra. He's smiling, watching her. 
 CASSANDRA : And if you'd actually seen them, they were shocked! But don't quote me on that. Oh, naughty. a bient&ocirc;t! 
 She walks away from the group of people she was talking to and Cassandra/Chip approaches her. 
 CASSANDRA-CHIP : Excuse me... Lady Cassandra... 
 CASSANDRA : I'm sorry, I don't need anything right now... I'm fine, thank you. 
 She turns away. 
 CASSANDRA / CHIP : No... I just wanted to say... you look beautiful. 
 Cassandra looks at him. 
 CASSANDRA : Well. That's very kind, you strange little thing. Thank you very much. 
 CASSANDRA-CHIP : I mean it. 
 He steps forward and looks straight into her eyes. 
 CASSANDRA-CHIP   (CONT'D)   (sincerely):  You look... so beautiful. 
 Cassandra stares at him, so touched. 
 CASSANDRA   (whispers):  Thank you. 
 Cassandra's-Chip's eyelids flutter closed and he keels over. 
 CASSANDRA   (alarmed):  Oh, my Lord. Are you alright? What is it? What's wrong? Someone get some help! 
 She gathers him into her arms. 
 CASSANDRA (CONT'D) : Call a medic or something, quickly! 
 WOMAN : Who is he? 
 CASSANDRA   (frantic):  I don't know. He just came up to me. I don't even know his name. He just collapsed. I think he's dying. Someone do something! I've got you, sweetheart... it's all right... 
 Rose looks close to tears, and the Doctor is watching solemnly. 
 CASSANDRA   (CONT'D)   (rocking him gently):  There you are... there you are, I've got you... it'll be all right. There, there, you poor little thing... 
 The Doctor and Rose walk slowly back to the TARDIS. The Doctor pauses for one last look before following Rose through the doors.
