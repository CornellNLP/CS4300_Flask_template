 [bird cawing] 
 How are we looking? 
 Well, if it’s an ambush, it’s a bloody good one. No spot for a sniper. Not that I can see, anyway. Which means you won’t, either, if there is one. 
 That would simplify matters. 
 Thank you, by the way. 
 What for? 
 Being here. Staying. It’s very good of you. God knows I’d leave if I could. 
 God knows I tried. 
 Why did you stay? 
 Stupidity. 
 So not honor, loyalty, hatred of tyranny? 
 ♪ 
 Nah. 
 You won’t confess to any finer feelings, will you? 
 Or maybe I just like a fight. [laughs softly] 
 [engines turn off] 
 [indistinct chatter] 
 If things go lemony, hit the deck and stay there. 
 Will do.

 [announcer] Lord James Harwood, 16th Earl of Dunboyne, leader of the Raven Union, high chancellor of Union-held England, has passed away following a severe heart attack. 
 Details will follow on the hour. 
 [Mary] Poor chap. 
 Good riddance. 
 Stresses of war, I expect. 
 Hoisted by his own guitar. 
 Would you stop staring out the window, please? 
 It’s making me nervous. 
 [exhales] Sorry. 
 You’re really scared, aren’t you? 
 Who, me? No. Just alert. 
 Your friend Alfie has no morals and no sense. 
 I’ll strangle him myself if Troy doesn’t do him in first. 
 Only joking. 
 Fair play. 
 But you can’t deny that Melanie was a gallus wee bird. 
 It’s hard to resist a smasher like that. 
 Men. 
 What’s wrong with you? 
 That’s a big question, Mrs. P. 
 [sighs] 
 [horn honks in distance] 
 [Aziz] Sir John. My congratulations. 
 Your fortunes have risen since we last met. 
 As have yours, Prime Minister. 
 I’ve been hearing many good things. 
 Mr. Pennyworth. A surprise and a pleasure to see you again. 
 And in such exalted company. 
 If your father could see you now, he’d be very proud. 
 Sir. 
 [Aziz] General Thursday. 
 Inspector. Hmm. 
 Interesting spot you chose. 
 Not one for the history books. New beginnings. 
 Lord Harwood had a taste for the theatrical. 
 Plain, simple honesty. That’s us. 
 [Aziz] My condolences for your great loss. 
 Lord Harwood was an outstanding leader. 
 Larger than life. Irreplaceable. 
 Everybody can be replaced. 
 Forgive me if I’m surprised that he’s been replaced by you, Sir John. 
 Not as surprised as I am. I’m not worthy, of course. 
 But if you think we’re discouraged, think again, sir. 
 Our cause is larger than any one man. 
 Lord Harwood led the Raven Union, but he did not command the Army. 
 It’s the Army who’ve beaten you in battle. 
 Not Lord Harwood. [Aziz] True. 
 You don’t need the Raven Union at all, really, do you? 
 [Thursday] On the contrary. 
 We need them to deal with clever chaps like you. 
 The Army takes no part in politics or government. 
 Warfare is our only trade. [Aziz] Indeed. 
 That’s why I’m rather surprised you approved Stormcloud. 
 That’s a purely Raven project, no? 
 We’re glad you know about Stormcloud. 
 You understand the seriousness of your predicament. 
 The Army had very little hand in it. 
 Or am I wrong? 
 Would the Army really let a political party use such a weapon on its own people? 
 All Raven Union military assets, including Stormcloud, are under Army Council command. 
 Isn’t that so, Sir John? 
 Mm. That is exactly so. 
 The Army and the Union are brothers, united. 
 Lord Harwood’s sad demise has only brought us closer together. 
 But it has also given us pause. 
 This war has gone on long enough. 
 We’d like to sit down and talk. 
 See if we can find an honorable peace. 
 We’re always happy to talk. 
 Compromise and reconciliation are desperately needed. 
 I could not agree more. 
 Compromise and reconciliation. 
 [Thursday] As to time and location, we leave that to you. 
 But I have a suggestion, if I may, And a favor to ask. 
 We’d like to bury Lord Harwood in his family crypt in London. 
 It would be a gesture of good faith on both sides if you’d allow his funeral party to enter the city. 
 We could hold talks after the ceremony. 
 In the spirit of new beginnings. 
 I must consult with Her Majesty the Queen first, of course, but, uh, I’m sure she’ll be happy to oblige. 
 ♪ 
 Here’s to Lord Harwood. [others] Lord Harwood. 
 May he rest in peace. Mm. May he rot in hell. 
 Whichever is deemed appropriate by the powers that be. 
 Hmm. 
 Well, I hate to be a wet blanket, but I’m not so sure that Harwood’s death is a good thing. 
 I agree. 
 Wow. Really? I am–I am deeply touched. Thank you. 
 Seriously, what do we know about this Salt character? 
 [Aziz] Well, he’s clever enough. But he has no power base. 
 And there’s clear tension between him and Thursday. 
 [door closes] They’re wobbling. 
 Politically vulnerable. 
 Why else would they ask for peace talks? 
 They still have Stormcloud. 
 Yes, but would they dare use it? That’s the question. 
 A madman like Harwood might do anything, but these are… 
 ordinary half-decent sort of men. 
 They’ll be mindful of the world’s opinion. 
 Fearful of consequences. 
 What did you think, Alfie? I was looking for snipers. 
 [Aziz] But you must have got a general sense. 
 Did they seem trustworthy? 
 I don’t trust anyone.

 The f*ck are you sneaking in like that for? 
 You’re plastered. That I am. 
 You’re supposed to be looking after Mum. 
 I can do two things at once. 
 It’s f*cking irresponsible. Where is she? 
 She’s having a snooze. Hey! 
 And it’s not me that’s irresponsible. It’s you. 
 Was it me that f*cked the wife of a stone-cold killer? 
 No. Yeah, right. Fair play. 
 But still. It’s me mum. Was it me that squandered America? No. 
 Was it me that f*cked away our travel money? 
 No. All right, all right. 
 I could be in California with a whore on my face. 
 There’s a nice picture. 
 Sorry, Mrs. P. I thought you were snoozing. 
 I was till you started yelling. 
 Your son’s got the gall to be angry with me for drinking on duty. 
 Duty? Protecting me from the fruits of your adultery. 
 Poor man’s entitled to be drunk. 
 He could be in California with… with all his hopes and dreams. 
 You wanted to stay. I did what you wanted. 
 I did what’s right. [drink pouring] 
 [Mary] You did this, you did that. 
 Never a thought for how anyone else might feel. 
 Ah. That’s right. [sighs] 
 A married woman. The shame. 
 If your father was alive, he’d be rolling in his grave. 
 I’m to be murdered in my bed by an angry cuckold or else gassed by a terror bomb. 
 And you only went and told her about Stormcloud. 
 Thanks very much. Well, you’re welcome. 
 It’s called honesty. 
 I don’t like to scare you. Do I look scared? 
 As it happens, I was at a very high-level secret meeting today. 
 Ooh. Oh, see him, Mary. Fancy Dan. 
 Now that loony old Lord Harwood’s dead, the Union want to hold peace talks. 
 The war will be over soon. There will be no terror bombs. 
 “Secret meetings” he says. 
 Who’s to know anymore whether he’s honest or he’s lying? 
 So sad but true, Mrs. P. So sad but true. 
 If you two are gonna gang up on me, then I’m off. You can look after yourselves. 
 Not likely. Where would you go? 
 He’s got nobody else. 
 Sandra won’t take him. 
 Look, Mum, you’re not going to be murdered in your bed or anywhere else. I promise. 
 I’ll sort things out with Gully. 
 We’ll talk. He’s a reasonable man at heart. 
 Don’t worry. I stopped worrying when your father died. 
 When death comes, I’ll be ready. 
 Now I’m off to work. 
 Hmm. Goodbye. 
 Goodbye. Yeah. 
 Shall I come to the hospital with you, Mrs. P, eh? 
 Just to be safe. No, you won’t. 
 Did you not hear what I just said? 
 That you’re ready to die? 
 [scoffs] 
 There’s ham in the larder if you want any. 
 [door opens] 
 Gully? 
 [door closes] A reasonable man at heart? 
 [glasses clink] I don’t want her worrying. 
 I’ll have to go and find him. Sort this out. 
 I can’t let it go on like this, just waiting for him to show up. 
 Oh, well, don’t you be going it alone. 
 You’ll need me for backup. 
 You know very well I have to go it alone. Alone. 
 Don’t you try following me. You hear me? 
 I hear you. 
 Are these peace talks real at least? 
 Oh, they’re real. But they’re a Union trick. 
 Not sure what sort, but they’re a trick. 
 That Salt’s a lairy little creature. 
 [Dixon] The meeting went well,I hope, sir. 
 Very well. Very well. 
 Call the crown undertaker and have him start making arrangements for His Lordship’s funeral. 
 Yes, sir. Of course. 
 But… surely no one will come if it’s in North London. 
 The League’s territory. 
 No, of course not. 
 But that’s not the point. 
 Mm. 
 [moans] Mm! 
 Oh, hold on there, stud. 
 [laughs] Slow up. Slow up. 
 [drops keys] We need to talk. Mm. 
 No, we don’t. Yes. Yes, we do. 
 About what? 
 Um, the-the birds and the bees. 
 Ah. Right. Well, no problem. 
 I’ve got a condom in my wallet. 
 You keep a condom in your wallet? 
 Why didn’t you use one before? 
 Mm, slipped my mind, I guess. 
 Heat of the moment. Oh, um, that’s funny. 
 Here we go again with the funny. Are we gonna have s*x or comedy? 
 If it’s the latter, I’ll keep my clothes on. 
 Uh, s*x. We’ll… we’ll have s*x. 
 But you won’t need your condom. 
 Mm, why’s that? 
 Because you didn’t use it last time and I’m already pregnant. 
 You’re not joking. 
 Nope. 
 But it’s kind of funny though, right? 
 We have s*x a few times and I get knocked up. 
 Oh, it’s a laugh riot. 
 Why the hell didn’t you tell me before now? 
 I don’t know. I was–I was waiting for the right moment. 
 Wh… 
 You knew about this when you refused to evacuate and you didn’t tell me. 
 That wasn’t the right moment? 
 Uh, well, I knew you’d try to make me leave. 
 Because you’re having a baby. 
 Which means I need to do whatever you tell me? 
 It means you leave a f*cking war zone. 
 I thought about the situation very carefully, and I decided to stay because the risks are worth taking. 
 I can make a difference here. It’s a war. 
 What are you, an attack helicopter? 
 I can make a difference. 
 Okay. 
 I’m-I’m… I’m sorry for yelling at you. 
 This is–It’s a surprise, that’s all. It’s… 
 It’s a good surprise. 
 And if I–if I remember right, you’re, uh, you’re what? 
 You’re-you’re, um, you’re about six weeks along? 
 Yeah. 
 Your sister says it’s a boy, and she’s always right, apparently. 
 Oh, that’s true. [laughs softly] 
 Um… 
 M-May I? 
 It’s your baby, too. 
 [both laugh softly] 
 Wow. Right? 
 [both laugh] 
 I will go see about a marriage license tomorrow. 
 Uh, what? A marriage license. 
 Can’t get married without one. 
 Who said we’re getting married? 
 Hmm? You didn’t ask me. 
 Maybe I don’t want to get married. 
 Oh, don’t be obtuse. We have to get married. 
 No, we don’t. 
 You’d sooner raise a b*st*rd than get married to me? 
 Really? It’s a close call. 
 No child of mine is gonna be illegitimate, so I’m sorry, I’m gonna have to insist that we do the right thing, 
 however repulsive you find me. 
 You “insist”that we get married? 
 I do. [scoffs] 
 Well… I insist that you kiss my pregnant ass. 
 Where are you going? 
 Leaving. This is your apartment. 
 Well, I need some air. Then I’ll come with you. 
 No. The hell you will.

 A noble life has ended. 
 As all life must end. Too soon. 
 Too soon to see his great works finished. 
 I want to take this opportunity to assure my fellow citizens that the country is in safe hands. 
 The Raven Union High Council and the Army General Staff are working hand in glove to continue the legacy of leadership bequeathed to us by this great man. 
 His life’s done. 
 But the fire he lit still burns, eh? 
 Let’s us all resolve to build that flame into a roaring furnace. 
 Let’s us all resolve to complete the noble work he began and make this green and pleasant land once again a beacon to the world! 
 Forgive my tears. 
 My heart’s in that coffin with Lord Harwood. 
 I’m a humble man from simple stock. 
 What strength I have, this man gave me. 
 The last thing he said to me before his mighty heart gave out… “Do your duty, son.” 
 “Do your duty,” he said. 
 With all my heart and soul, I intend to obey that order! 
 And in his name, in England’s name…

 It wasn’t. 
 Where is he? 
 He’s maybe went to see Gully. 
 He said he might, eh? 
 Alone? 
 Why didn’t you go with him? 
 He said he had to go alone.

 After which, we’ll be looking at some of his greatest moments, remembering our noble leader.

 Negotiations happen when both sides have something to offer. 
 Peace talks happen when one side has their foot on the other’s throat. 
 We invited you here in good faith. 
 What remains of League forces and both of you personally must surrender unconditionally. 
 If you fail to do so, we will deploy a Stormcloud device over London.

 I’d have been terribly disappointed if you’d let me sneak up on you. 
 You took long enough. 
 Mm. Disgracefully slow. 
 I must be getting old. 
 Anyway, here we are. 
 Just so you know… it wasn’t Melanie’s fault. 
 I pushed myself on her. Oh. 
 A gentleman to the end, eh? 
 Nonsense, of course. 
 Melanie’s a whore, and she wanted to hurt me. 
 You were hurting her. That’s what she wanted. 
 Not sure she did, actually. 
 Aw. Well, I… I think you’d be surprised. 
 I’m very glad you got her on that plane. 
 ‘Cause killing a woman is–it’s a sign of weakness, isn’t it? 
 An admission of– of failure. 
 And then killing a man on the other hand, well… 
 There’s a hundred good reasons to kill a man. 
 You led me astray, Gully. 
 I thought you were a bloody hero. 
 Turns out you’re just bloody mad. 
 Oh, such… such vim, such courage. 
 You know, Melanie used to needle me that I was in love with you. 
 And she did needle me, because it’s true. 
 I do love you… in my own way. 
 [both grunting] 
 [yells] 
 [both grunting, straining] 
 Ah! [gasps] 
 [ragged breathing] 
 [panting] Oh, God! 
 [laughing] 
 What’s so funny? [breathing heavily] 
 I believe… I believe I taught you how to make this trap. 
 You did. The Sumatran Whip. 
 What’s even funnier is that I killed the man who taught me. 
 He was a Dayak headhunter. 
 He was a kindly old chap. 
 Had seven wives, you know? 
 And a throne of skulls. 
 [groans] [chuckles] 
 Takes all sorts. 
 Yeah. 
 Alfie? 
 Aren’t you going to kill me?! 
 Nah. 
 I’m grateful to you, Gully. 
 I’d forgotten how much I enjoy all this. 
 I feel very alive. 
 So thank you.

 Don’t you start. 
 Wasn’t going to say a word. 
 Come all the way from the afterlife with nothing to say? Ha. 
 I doubt it. 
 I’m not here to talk. 
 I’m here to guide you over, if necessary. 
 f*ck off. 
 You’re not guiding me anywhere. 
 Not my call. 
 Not looking good, is it? 
 No, I’m staying. 
 I got things I want to do. 
 Such as what? 
 Just out of interest. 
 I want to, well… I want to make a difference. 
 A difference? To what? 
 No. It’s embarrassing. 
 You can tell me anything. I’m dead. 
 My dad was right. 
 You have to serve something or someone. 
 And I want to make this a happy, peaceful country again. 
 [Bazza laughs] 
 Don’t f*cking laugh. 
 I think I can help. 
 That’s a noble plan. 
 Good luck with that. 
 Thank you for your support.

 Also, what’s so funny about peace and happiness?

 Don’t worry, Mum. 
 It’s just a scratch. 
 Look at you. [Alfred] I know. 
 Another good suit ruined, eh? 
 Hey, Gully’s in the woods. 
 He needs an ambulance. 
 Does he? 
 I mean, really, does he? 
 Yeah. Right. Up. 
 Yeah, he does. All right.

 Up! Got him.

 Come on, big boy. I’ve got you. 
 There you go. Oh, Alfie.

 I’ll be running about in no time.

 Brothers and sisters… I am here to ask humbly for your blessing. 
 I ask you to ratify my status as pro tem high chancellor of the kingdom. 
 We’ve suffered a terrible loss. 
 And I’ve only been in this job a short while, but hopefully I’ve shown that I’m fit for purpose.

 I’ve rallied the rank and file. 
 I’ve brought a devastating new weapon onto the battlefield. 
 Our enemies will soon be forced to surrender. 
 Very soon. 
 I stand proudly on that record and humbly ask for your votes. 
 Thank you.

 Yes.
