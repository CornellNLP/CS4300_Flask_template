 [music] 
 - There you go. 
 - Nice one. 
 Any trouble, Gully? 
 You know me. 
 I love a crisis. 
 f*cking have you, mate. 
 You're dead! 
 Shut it, Dobson! 
 Get this idiot out here now. 
 Always think well of me. 
 WOMAN: He was upset about all that Raven Society logo. 
 - No surrender! 
 - He's not one of them. 
 Dad, don't do this. 
 God bless England! 
 His own son killed his father. 
 I can't even look at you without thinking about what happened. 
 Now, the results of the latest Stormcloud test. 
 [Man screaming in agony] 
 Stormcloud test, that sounds intriguing. 
 Well, it is all very speculative. 
 You know these baffles. 
 KATIE: You're crazy. 
 Stop moaning. 
 I won't hear such talk. 
 We must think positively. 
 If our special partner is suffering  from some sort of... 
 scandal,  then we would find a way of showing him...gratitude. 
 Archbishop, partner. 
 CROWLEY: Prime Minister of the English League. 
 Considered it done. 
 We got the money. 
 A new life. 
 America, boys. 
 Slainte va! 
 [screaming] 
 Mum? 
 Alfred. 
 I've been kidnapped. 
 If you want to see me alive again, come alone. 
 Freeze! 
 [Alarm going off] 
 They got my money. 
 You let them get away. 
 - What money is that? 
 - Ransom money. 
 They abducted my mum! 
 What the f*ck are you doing here? 
 [Mortar shells falling] 
 [Bells ringing] 
 [People screaming in the streets] 
 [Siren alarm sounding] 
 [Mortars whistling above] 
 [People screaming in panic] 
 [Strong wind] 
 [Dramatic music] 
 [footsteps] 
 [dramatic music] 
 COAL SELLER: Take cover, Mary! 
 COAL SELLER: Mary! 
 Mary! 
 [loud whistling sound] 
 - MAN: Mary! 
 - COAL SELLER: Take cover! 
 - [Big explosion] 
 - [People screaming] 
 Dad. 
 Morning, son. 
 You are alive. 
 Am I? 
 - I'm asking you. 
 - Do I look dead? 
 Buh... 
 You don't look well. 
 You don't look too good yourself. 
 I'm doing alright. 
 Don't lie to me, son. 
 I can tell something is wrong. 
 Had a bit of a setback, that's all. 
 Me and mum and the boys are going to America. 
 But some b*st*rd stole our money. 
 - America? 
 - England's buggered. 
 Your Raven Society mob are on top. 
 I've got no choice. 
 Oh, I see. 
 Running away. 
 Abandoning the country you love. 
 Well, I have to say Alfie. 
 I'm surprised. 
 Surprised and disappointed. 
 I don't like running away. 
 But what do you want me to do? 
 Die for a lost cause? 
 [laugh] 
 MR. PENNYWORTH: Ahhh [in pain] 
 Eh... 
 [Sniff] 
 Eh... 
 MR. PENNYWORTH: [Coughing] 
 Ahhhh [grunts] 
 So he still owes you money? 
 - I don't know. 
 Do you know? 
 - What the f*ck would I know? 
 Well, aren't you? 
 Up there looking down at all of us? 
 ALFIE: Seeing what everyone is up to? 
 You think I'm sitting on a cloud in a white nighty, do you? 
 Playing a midget harp? 
 Well... 
 yeah. 
 Something like that. 
 That's a very childish notion of death you got there, son. 
 Maybe I'm not even dead. 
 Did you see a body? 
 Maybe I'm in America eating hamburgers on a beach. 
 - Are you? 
 - A minced meat sandwich? 
 Disgusting idea. 
 Nice to know who stole your money. 
 Well, as a general rule,  it's nearly always trusted colleagues  or friends or family that bugger you. 
 MR. 
 PENNYWORTH: As I found to my own cost, eh? 
 That's not fair. 
 I didn't--  [Explosion in the background] 
 [mysterious music] 
 Oh, f*ck! 
 Of course! 
 Why didn't I see it? 
 [Sirens going off] 
 On the settee! 
 Mrs. 
 PENNYWORTH: And be gentle! 
 GIRL [grunting] 
 Don't worry, love. 
 I'm going to help you. 
 WOODY: You're gonna be all right. 
 MRS. 
 PENNYWORTH: You are going to be all right, my love. 
 MRS. 
 PENNYWORTH: You're going to be fine. 
 - What happened? 
 - Didn't you hear the mortars? 
 - Woody, first aid tin. 
 Bastards. 
 Third attack this week. 
 Yeah, I know. 
 I'll have to fix the bloody windows again. 
 - GIRL [moaning in discomfort] 
 - Is she all right? 
 Yeah! 
 She's fine. 
 It looks worse than it is. 
 Good, Good. 
 Listen. 
 I've, um--I've got--  - Put the kettle on, would you? 
 - Yes, mum,  and then I really have to run. 
 Thank you, Woody. 
 All right. 
 I have to clean this out. 
 - Shall I put a tea in a pot? 
 - Who wants a cuppa now? 
 It's for cleaning her wounds, you silly sausage. 
 Miss Nightingale, kettle on. 
 Anything else you need? 
 No, no, we're alright. 
 You run along if you are busy. 
 - Sure? 
 - You'll just be in the way. 
 ALFIE: Right then. 
 Good luck, young lady. 
 See you later, mum. 
 And remember to loosen that tourniquet  every now and again. 
 - No, really? 
 Be good. 
 - Yeah. 
 - [door slamming] 
 - There you go. 
 Woody, go and get that water, a nice clean dish. 
 Keep it hygienic. 
 Bring a fresh towel, if we got one. 
 [People talking] 
 MAN: Scum. 
 [man laughing] 
 Oi! 
 Martha! 
 You are not talking to me now? 
 No, actually, I am not. 
 ALFIE: Why? 
 What have I done to you? 
 John Salt? 
 That piece of sh1t Nazi that you let go for money? 
 Yeah. 
 Right. 
 I wouldn't do that. 
 I'm disappointed. 
 I thought you were a man of honour. 
 People disappoint you a lot, don't they? 
 Perhaps your standards are too high. 
 [saxophone music playing] 
 I saw your boyfriend at the club. 
 Changing the subject doesn't change the truth. 
 What boyfriend? 
 You got more than one? 
 Thomas Wayne. 
 He was with that Satanist bloke. 
 What's his name? 
 Crowley. 
 Really? 
 ALFIE: You didn't know he was back. 
 I mean... he was with Crowley? 
 Yeah. 
 Funny, ain't it? 
 Anyway, be good. 
 [piano music] 
 And slow... exactly, yeah! 
 [piano music from the club] 
 Should we do the full round? 
 You want this, mate. 
 You want this one. 
 No, no. 
 We'll look somewhere else. 
 It's genuine, proper. 
 [piano music from the nightclub] 
 Alright, lads. 
 We're not buying. 
 You haven't seen what I got. 
 More carats than Sainsbury's. 
 Solid gold setting. 
 A ring like this'll get the knickers off a nun. 
 Yours for a monkey. 
 Do you, Ken? 
 What happened to us, Ken? 
 Yeah, I heard. 
 f*cking liberty. 
 What the f*ck makes you think we've got a twatting monkey  to spend on your shite there? 
 What the f*ck? 
 - I'm only asking. 
 - Are you joking with me, pal? 
 Relax, brother. 
 Have you heard anything? 
 If I heard, I'd tell you wouldn't I? 
 - DAVEBOY: Would you? 
 - I would. 
 - But you're the man - that hears everything. 
 People say Ken the Spot knows what's what. 
 People say that, right? 
 If there was talk, I'd have heard it. 
 There's been no talk. 
 Tell the truth or die, you Saxon dosser? 
 Who took our money? 
 I don't know. 
 I swear, I don't know. 
 At ease, Private MacDougal. 
 Wotcher Kenny. 
 What the f*ck, lads? 
 - You try controlling him. 
 - No, brother. 
 I was just confirming his veracity. 
 - f*ck's safe, Alfie. 
 - Yeah, I know, I know. 
 I'm sorry for the agro. 
 We need a moment as it goes. 
 No bother. 
 Got a lovely bit of tom, if you're interested. 
 f*ck off, Kenny. 
 Regards to the missus. 
 - He would lie to us, you know. 
 - Course he would. 
 Shifty b*st*rd. 
 But he wasn't. 
 ALFIE: I think I know who done it,  and he's nobody Ken'd know. 
 - DAVEBOY: Well? 
 - I had a really strange dream. 
 Oh, f*ck. 
 Here we go. 
 Alright, never mind the dream. 
 But it made me think, and I realized  the thief must be Gully Troy. 
 The captain? 
 Never. 
 He's SA f*cking S. 
 He'd never rob a comrade. 
 No, it was him. 
 Or someone working for him. 
 You have any proof? 
 Isn't it always a close friend that f*cks you up? 
 Someone you trust? 
 That's not proof. 
 Alright, who's not afraid of us? 
 Very few. 
 And Troy's one. 
 Who's got enough discipline to stay under the radar? 
 And who knew we had all that cash? 
 Only man I can think of is Gully Troy. 
 True. 
 I can't see it. 
 He's a man of honor. 
 Proved himself a hundred times. 
 Maybe he's changed somehow. 
 BAZZA: Suppose he has. 
 BAZZA: We've no proof at all. 
 How do we find out for sure? 
 [intro music] 
 I'll ask him. 
 [music] 
 Good Lord. 
 We pray you will cleanse this poor soul. 
 Cast Satan from his heart. 
 Let him find peace  in the arms of our savior  Jesus Christ. 
 CROWLEY: [crying] 
 Rise, old chap. 
 Thank you. 
 Oh, don't thank me. 
 You know who to thank. 
 CROWLEY: When I pray alone, the devil torments me. 
 How does he torment you? 
 Temptations of the flesh, Your Grace. 
 All the many temptations of the flesh. 
 That's a sad mistake to credit the devil with our sexuality. 
 s*x is a gift from God. 
 POTTER: A natural blessing, like sunshine. 
 We must be doing it differently. 
 Ha. 
 Would you speak with some of my friends? 
 It would be wonderful if they, too,  could hear what you have to say. 
 Friends? 
 You'd call them my fellow s*x addicts. 
 Poor souls trapped in a web of their own desires. 
 You can't imagine what they do  to feed their lust for debasement. 
 Naked... 
 shameless  animal lust. 
 You simply can't imagine. 
 I'll talk with any soul who wants to hear the gospel. 
 However sinful they may be. 
 Thank you. 
 You're a good man. 
 [dog barking] 
 [crows cawing] 
 [footsteps] 
 Hello. 
 ALFIE: I'm looking for Mr. Gulliver Troy. 
 Who are you? 
 Pennyworth. 
 Alfred Pennyworth. 
 Mmm. 
 I've heard of you. 
 The famous Alfie. 
 Who are you? 
 I'm Mrs. Troy. 
 Oh. 
 Nice to meet you. 
 [footsteps walking away] 
 [ALFIE'S footsteps] 
 [horse race on TV] 
 Is he here? 
 No. 
 Do you know where he is? 
 Has something bad happened? 
 No. 
 Just business. 
 Business. 
 You don't look like I expected you to look. 
 No? 
 Gully loves you. 
 Says you're very clever and hard as nails. 
 You look soft to me. 
 Like butter. 
 Do you know where he is? 
 MRS. TROY: What about me? 
 What about you? 
 Do I look like you expected? 
 No offense, Mrs. Troy. 
 I didn't know you existed. 
 Gully likes to keep me separate  from the squalid side of his life. 
 I expect he'll be angry that you came here. 
 Look, Mrs. Troy, if you know where he is--  My name is Melanie. 
 Why are you carrying a gun? 
 - It's a war on. 
 - Mmm. 
 So I hear. 
 I don't mean your husband any harm  if that's what you're worried about. 
 You? 
 Do him harm? 
 As if you could. 
 MRS. TROY: f*ck! 
 [horse race on TV] 
 Second by a nose. 
 ALFIE: Bad luck. 
 Are you a betting man, Alfie? 
 Nah. 
 If you're not in the know, it's a mug's game. 
 He's at the garage. 
 MRS. TROY: 127 Barnett Road. 
 Thank you. 
 Don't tell him I told you. 
 I'm supposed to keep it a secret. 
 Then why did you tell me? 
 Do you always do what you're supposed to do? 
 Hum. 
 Nice to meet you, Mrs. Troy. 
 [intriguing music] 
 [car door slamming] 
 You sure about this bloke? 
 I'm not sure about anyone anymore,  but he was a good teacher. 
 [knock on door] 
 Good Lord. 
 Katherine. 
 How lovely to see you. 
 What a nice surprise. 
 Hello, Mr. Furbank. 
 This is my friend Bet. 
 Nice to meet you Bet. 
 Any friend of Katherine's and all that. 
 But please, call me Dorian. 
 I'll do. 
 Come in. 
 Come in. 
 Well, welcome to my humble abode. 
 To what do I owe the..? 
 We're, um-- We're on a jaunt. 
 A jaunt? 
 - What's wrong with a jaunt? 
 - Er, nothing at all. 
 We'll have some tea if you're offering. 
 Er, certainly. 
 I'll put the kettle on. 
 This your stuff on the walls? 
 For my sins. 
 A lot of women with no clothes on. 
 I find the human figure endlessly fascinating. 
 I'll bet you do. 
 You're not much cop, though, are you? 
 They're all wonky. 
 What's funny? 
 They're meant to be that way. 
 Tits on her. 
 Two ferrets in a plastic bag. 
 Forgive my asking. 
 you're not in some sort of trouble, are you? 
 What makes you think we're in trouble? 
 DORIAN: Uh, nothing. 
 Just... 
 Nothing. 
 Kettle. 
 Artist, my foot. 
 Shh. 
 He's a perv. 
 [music plays on the radio] 
 Banjo! 
 You expecting any visitors? 
 [music plays on the radio] 
 [metal bangs] 
 [rifle loading] 
 Building your own tank? 
 BANJO: What's it to you to you? 
 ALFIE: No trouble, mates. 
 Alfie. 
 What a nice surprise. 
 BANJO: What the f*ck is he doing here? 
 [metal banging] 
 [hammer hitting a surface] 
 I, er, I heard about your misfortune. 
 I'm so sorry. 
 You must be gutted. 
 Fortunes of war. 
 I still have hopes we'll get the money back. 
 Do you? 
 Good show. 
 How did you track me down by the way? 
 Not hard. 
 People know you're here. 
 I suspect one of your lads has been talking. 
 TROY: Huh. 
 ALFIE: You always used to say a good soldier  gets straight to the point. 
 So that's what I'm going to do, sir. 
 Sir, is it? 
 That doesn't bode well. 
 I think it might have been you  that took my money and abducted my mum. 
 ALFIE: I'm not laughing. 
 That's why it's funny. 
 You knew I had cash. 
 Nobody else knew. 
 I expect one of your lads has been talking. 
 You haven't denied anything yet. 
 Well, frankly, I'm speechless, Alfie. 
 I can't believe we're even having this conversation. 
 How could you possibly think such a thing? 
 ALFIE: A good soldier is ruthless. 
 I said that too. 
 Ruthless, yes. 
 But dishonorable. 
 Never dishonorable. 
 You haven't told me yes or no. 
 Look me in the eye, Alfie. 
 I swear to you  on my honor  that I did not take your f*cking money. 
 Alright then. 
 I'm glad to hear you say so. 
 I did abduct your mother, but hey ho. 
 Yeah, fair play. 
 Have a go. 
 But I had to ask. 
 Who else would have the nerve to rob us? 
 Flattery now, is it? 
 I'd be angry if I didn't feel so sorry for you. 
 The sawbones call what you have paranoia. 
 You'd have it too if you were me. 
 [pouring drink] 
 TROY: Alfie. 
 Good soldier. 
 [both] 
 Has no pity for himself. 
 Exactly. 
 [people working in the workshop] 
 Never really knew what you meant by that. 
 Not until the last couple of years taught me. 
 No. 
 Before you start weeping girlishly into my shoulder,  I have a proposition that might solve some of your problems. 
 You can come and join us. 
 You'll have a wonderful time and you'll make big money. 
 - I'm not a crook. 
 - Nor am I, son. 
 I'd like to think of myself more as a...as a privateer. 
 Same business. 
 You break the law every week. 
 - What law? 
 - Exactly. 
 I'm ducking and diving. 
 Robbery is different. 
 It's robbery. 
 What? 
 Sordid? 
 Dishonorable? 
 Eh. 
 Come on, spit it out. 
 Well, yeah. 
 It is dishonorable. 
 TROY: Alfie. 
 Am I an honorable man? 
 - Yes. 
 Of course you are. 
 - As are you. 
 So what we do is by definition honorable. 
 I need your help. 
 I work with Bazza and Daveboy. 
 I'll hire them as well. 
 I've got two big jobs coming up. 
 You can come on board as my left hand. 
 It'll be just like the old days. 
 Well, that's the thing, Gully. 
 When I left the service, I swore to myself  I'd be me own man, captain of me own ship. 
 So far, I've kept my word. 
 Now, that I do understand. 
 Not very good at taking orders myself. 
 Don't get me wrong. 
 There's nobody I'd rather work for. 
 But I'd be working for you. 
 As you wish. 
 But the offer stands. 
 Good morning, Your Grace. 
 [young men and women chattering and wheezing indistinguishable] 
 POTTER: Good God. 
 What on earth...? 
 Where am I? 
 CROWLEY: Surely you haven't forgotten. 
 We had a wonderful evening. 
 An open and honest exchange, as it were. 
 You're quite the tiger. 
 Isn't he a tiger, boys and girls? 
 [young men and women and giggling] 
 Now--Now, look here. 
 I don't know anything about this. 
 Relax, old chap. 
 Consenting adults and all that. 
 You...You tricked me! 
 CROWLEY: Where's the trick? 
 You got what you wanted. 
 What you needed. 
 No, no, no, I never wanted this. 
 Be honest, old chap. 
 If you didn't want this, you wouldn't be here, would you? 
 I think a group photograph is in order. 
 [young men and women chattering and laughing] 
 POTTER [shouting nervously] 
 I didn't think he had it in him, so to speak. 
 Good God. 
 Poor chap. 
 Well, that's the end of him, I suppose [laughing] 
 Now, the League have lost two Prime Ministers. 
 Poor things will be in complete disarray. 
 HARWOOD: I don't know. 
 The Church of England is so liberal these days. 
 It might make him more popular. 
 There are limits, Jimmy, even today. 
 I mean, vicars can away with that sort of thing,  but archbishops must keep their cocks in their cassocks. 
 [laughs hysterically] 
 Jimmy. 
 You need a nap. 
 You look fagged out. 
 How long have you been up working? 
 There's a war on, old girl. 
 These damn Northerners still holding out. 
 They must be eating their own children by now. 
 But yeah, I could do with a little snore. 
 If you'll bear with me a little longer, my lord,  these files need your attention rather urgently. 
 They won't take long. 
 GAUNT: Really, Salt... 
 No, never mind. 
 Lead on, MacDuff. 
 Sir, there's a woman on the line  who's been calling every day trying to reach you. 
 I wouldn't bother you, but she's very persistent. 
 She says her name's Bet Sykes. 
 She says she's a close personal friend of yours. 
 For God sake. 
 Bet Sykes. 
 Do not speak to that woman, Jimmy. 
 She's not the thing. 
 Don't be silly. 
 Put her through. 
 Charles, put her through, please. 
 CHARLES: Putting her through now. 
 - Bet? 
 - Your Lordship! 
 Thank f*ck. 
 I've been trying to get hold of you for days. 
 Oh, I'm so sorry. 
 We're very busy here,  what with the war and all of that. 
 How are you, my dear? 
 HARWOOD: How's Peggy? 
 f*ck off! 
 This is a private call. 
 Peggy is London working, so I can't turn to her. 
 BET: I'm in a spot of bother. 
 I need your help. 
 What is it? 
 Anything? 
 What's wrong? 
 I got into an argy bargy with a bloke from work. 
 Long story short,  I killed him. 
 Bet, you are incorrigible. 
 Thank you. 
 I like to think so. 
 Any road, seeing as he was a superior officer,  I thought I'd best leg it. 
 Now I've got rozzers chasing me all over the f*cking Midlands. 
 For God sake. 
 BET: I was hoping you might see your way to sorting this out,  you being High Chancellor and all that. 
 Bet, murdering a superior officer,  I mean, it's not the thing. 
 BET: I know, I know. 
 I'm sorry. 
 But the bugger deserved it, honestly. 
 Where are you? 
 I'm in a place called... 
 Fork Lane Farm, Little Edlesbank, Northamptonshire. 
 Ok, you stay there. 
 I'll send some men to pick you up and bring you here. 
 Lovely. 
 Be good to see you again. 
 Bet, this really is the last time. 
 You must learn to control your temper. 
 I know. 
 I will. 
 Promise. 
 Thank you. 
 Much appreciated. 
 See you soon. 
 BET: [hanging up phone] 
 Sorted it. 
 Really? 
 Truly? 
 I told you, didn't I? 
 Bet Sykes has got herself into another dreadful scrape. 
 Go to this address with your best man. 
 Pick her up and bring her here. 
 Jimmy, do not bring disorder acquaintance. 
 You have responsibilities. 
 I will make my own friends, thank you, Francis. 
 If I may sir, I must agree with Mrs. 
 Gaunt. 
 I know you're fond of Miss Sykes. 
 but she is something of a liability--  [grunting] 
 A little unstable? 
 Thank you, Salt. 
 When I want your advice, I shall ask for it. 
 Now, do as you're told. 
 At once sir. 
 I'll come back for the files. 
 [mysterious music] 
 Listen, Jimmy--  I like her company. 
 That's an end on it. 
 DORIAN: I'm glad we have this moment alone together. 
 Tell me, are you alright? 
 I'm fine. 
 I'm good. 
 I can't help notice some sort of tension  between you and your friend. 
 No. 
 Is she your friend? 
 
 
 
 Of course she is. 
 Katherine, you can trust me with the truth. 
 DORIAN: What's going on? 
 You don't want to get involved. 
 DORIAN: That woman has some power over you. 
 Yes. 
 No. 
 KATIE: I don't know. 
 [thunder] 
 I'm scared of her, but... 
 She saved my life. 
 I think she wants to be friends. 
 DORIAN: She seems somewhat eccentric. 
 Deranged perhaps. 
 She's not. 
 Maybe she is. 
 Maybe I am. 
 DORIAN: Katherine, tell me what's going on--  [door slams] 
 That lavatory's a disgrace. 
 Single men, eh? 
 You live like animals. 
 What were you talking about? 
 We were talking about art actually. 
 No, you weren't, you were talking about me. 
 What did you tell him? 
 - Nothing. 
 Nothing? 
 You were holding hands like sweethearts. 
 No, Bet. 
 It's not what you think. 
 Dorian was just being nice. 
 - Nice about what? 
 - I was just--  Quiet, you. 
 It's her I'm--  DORIAN [screaming in panic] 
 Sorry, Pet. 
 This gun's new to me. 
 [whimpering] 
 MRS. 
 PENNYWORTH [humming a song] 
 I'm off to the club, mum. 
 ALFIE: Don't wait up. 
 Alright, sweetheart. 
 Be good. 
 You seem very cheerful. 
 Mustn't grumble. 
 Jackie's going to be alright, so that's a blessing, isn't it? 
 Jackie? 
 On another planet you are. 
 The girl that was here? 
 Bleeding all over the place? 
 Oh, yeah. 
 Nice one. 
 Dr. 
 Patel said I saved her life. 
 Did he? 
 Good job. 
 I'm proud of you, mum. 
 Yeah. 
 I'm proud of me, I know. 
 That's what I said to myself. 
 Sofa's buggered. 
 Nothing a bit of soap and water won't fix. 
 It's good to see you smiling again. 
 Nothing like a little blood and guts to brighten the day, eh? 
 Maybe so. 
 I won't lie. 
 And I'm sorry for your misfortune, but... 
 I'm happy you're not going to America anymore. 
 Who says I'm not going? 
 Well, how you gonna go without any money? 
 You missed a spot. 
 ALFIE: See you later. 
 Be good. 
 I wish you'd stop telling me that. 
 I'll stop telling you that when you stop needing to be told. 
 Bye. 
 Cheeky sod. 
 [jazz music from nightclub] 
 [jazz music nightclub] 
 Thank you, Sheri. 
 She's a gallus wee bird, that Sheri, eh? 
 She's warming to me, I can tell. 
 - What did Gully say? 
 - He denied it. 
 - Do you believe him? 
 - I want to. 
 He was convincing. 
 I can't see who else it could be. 
 Nobody else knew about the money. 
 Uh-huh. 
 That's true, most likely. 
 Most likely. 
 It's interesting how memories come back to you, isn't it? 
 ALFIE: f*ck's sake, Daveboy. 
 What memories? 
 Remember that first stack of American money we got? 
 We were so happy. 
 BAZZA: Yes? 
 I took a hundred dollar bill. 
 I know it was wrong, but it just looked so nice. 
 I folded it up little and I keep it in my pocket. 
 so I take it out sometimes and I look at. 
 Cheers me up. 
 You know. 
 And I did that earlier. 
 And I was shocked. 
 f*ck's sake, Daveboy. 
 What? 
 I kept that note as clean as the day I nicked it. 
 And look at it now. 
 It's all dirty. 
 How the hell I thought. 
 Then I realized... 
 ...those are beer stains. 
 I was in a booth with some guys  talking about my ranch in Montana  and they were laughing at me, the c**ts,  so I--I showed 'em that to shut their gobs. 
 And there's plenty more where that comes from I said--  Said to who, exactly? 
 That's what I don't remember. 
 Could've been polar bears, Baz. 
 f*ck's sake, Daveboy. 
 At least I'm telling the truth, eh? 
 BAZZA: Bravo. 
 Now we're back to square one. 
 Anyone could have known. 
 On the bright side,  I'm glad I wasn't there when you accused Troy. 
 Wasn't pretty. 
 But he's alright, is he? 
 Not too offended? 
 Nah. 
 Offered us jobs with his team. 
 What did you say? 
 - He said no. 
 - DAVEBOY: Why? 
 They make good money, robbers. 
 DAVEBOY: He's a canny man, that Troy. 
 He likes the edge too much for my taste. 
 Plus, we are not robbers, are we? 
 ALFIE: We're better than that. 
 If you say so. 
 WOMAN: Same againg lads? 
 - Yeah, thanks. 
 - Hi. 
 [drink pouring] 
 It's a nice piece of tom. 
 Thank you. 
 Well, I like it. 
 Looks familiar. 
 Looks like the ring Kenny the Spot showed us. 
 Yes, it does. 
 Five hundred pound ring that is. 
 No wonder you've no time for me. 
 Some b*st*rd's been pricing me out, eh? 
 Who gave you that then? 
 - An admirer. 
 - That's a lot of admiration. 
 Who is this admirer? 
 Vic. 
 Vic Dobson. 
 For my birthday. 
 Vic... 
 Vic? 
 Pikey Vic Dobson? 
 He's a good bloke. 
 What the f*ck. 
 You've been turning me away for a twat like that? 
 That's f*cking embarrassing. 
 Dobson's never had tuppence. 
 Where'd he get five hundred quid to buy a ring like that? 
 Aaaah. 
 DAVEBOY: Good question. 
 Why are you all looking at me like that? 
 Look. 
 Quiet. 
 Bet, please, stop. 
 You're scaring me. 
 Relax, pet. 
 His Lordship's people will be here soon,  and off we'll be away, safe and sound. 
 You've got the wrong idea about me. 
 One more word from you  and you'll be choking on your own cock. 
 You ever seen someone choke on their own cock? 
 I have. 
 KATIE: Bet. 
 He's done nothing wrong. 
 He's a friend. 
 A friend? 
 I'm beginning to wonder about you. 
 I thought you were a good lass. 
 Maybe I were led astray. 
 You're all lies and deception you are. 
 Artist? 
 But you can't even f*cking draw. 
 Actually, she's very gifted. 
 Shut it, wonky tits. 
 f*ck you know? 
 Draw something. 
 And it better be good  or I'll put holes in Rolf Harris here. 
 Go on! 
 Draw. 
 I had a little sister once. 
 Gone now. 
 Poor lass could draw like anybody's business. 
 You'd think it was a photograph. 
 [police siren] 
 Oh. 
 Here we go. 
 Told you he'd come through. 
 But it's the police. 
 What d'you expect? 
 Circus clowns? 
 DORIAN: Help! 
 There's a mad woman! 
 [rifles loading] 
 [dramatic music] 
 Head down. 
 You're all right. 
 [tower church bells and booms going on] 
 [dramatic music] 
 [metal stool shaking aggressively] 
 [robe getting tighter] 
 [dramatic music continues] 
 Poor soul. 
 The wretched man's left us in an awful pickle, though. 
 Our Prime Minister gone and in such a shameful fashion. 
 We look weak and ridiculous. 
 Potter was simply a hastily elected Prime Minister. 
 He was well liked, sure, but weak. 
 We have plenty of good candidates  to elect in his place. 
 This must be Crowley's work. 
 This sort of thing is his bread and butter. 
 THE QUEEN: That grubby little Satanist chap? 
 He wouldn't dare. 
 With Raven Union blessing, he would. 
 This would have come from the top. 
 How could Jimmy Harwood sink so low? 
 Fucker. 
 [suspense music] 
 [door shutting] 
 MARINE: Ma'am. 
 Thank you. 
 Wow! 
 Fancy. 
 What a pleasant unexpected surprise. 
 A surprise is always unexpected, isn't it? 
 I got the impression you were grumpy with me. 
 Sulking. 
 Me? 
 Why would I be sulking? 
 - Hmm. 
 When we last met, you held me personally responsible  for American foreign policy,  said some rather ugly things, and marched out. 
 Hence sulking. 
 I apologize. 
 I know you're not to blame for what you do. 
 You're just a tiny cog in the machine. 
 I wouldn't say cog. 
 A lever maybe. 
 You can tell me the truth, you know. 
 - What truth? 
 - I won't be mad. 
 Forgive me. 
 I'm not following your train of thought. 
 At first I said to myself... 
 ...no. 
 No, not Thomas. 
 He's no saint, but he'd never... 
 He'd never do something truly low and evil. 
 Ok. 
 I know where this is going--  But then, then I thought, why not? 
 Why wouldn't you? 
 You're just a cog, sorry... 
 ...a lever. 
 You're not morally responsible. 
 So why wouldn't you help Aleister f*cking Crowley  drive a good man to suicide? 
 Martha, allow me one moment to explain--  Tell me it's not true. 
 [suspense music] 
 Nobody wanted him dead. 
 You son of a bitch. 
 God. 
 [suspense music] 
 DAVEBOY: Look at that shitehole. 
 f*cking shameful. 
 Us, robbed by a wee dosser like Vic Dobson. 
 We'd best keep this one quiet, eh? 
 Which is Dobson's caravan? 
 I don't know. 
 DAVEBOY: Of course you do. 
 I don't. 
 They all look the same. 
 Never mind. 
 We'll manage. 
 BAZZA: Shouldn't we watch a while? 
 Get the lay of the land? 
 It's Vic Dobson, not the Waffen SS. 
 Still. 
 We shouldn't get complacent. 
 He's got our money. 
 Let's go get it back. 
 [music] 
 Sheri. 
 Vic needs waking. 
 Give him a shout. 
 What? 
 No. 
 You're perfectly safe. 
 Now go on. 
 Vic! 
 Louder, love. 
 SHERI: Vic! 
 ALFIE: Louder! 
 SHERI: Vic! 
 ALFIE: Louder! 
 SHERI: Vic! 
 ALFIE: Louder! 
 SHERI: Vic! 
 DAVEBOY: Where the f*ck are you going, you cowards? 
 Stay here. 
 f*ck. 
 [both grunting] 
 [dramatic music] 
 [both yelling] 
 [dramatic music continues] 
 DOBSON [screaming in pain] 
 [dramatic music continues] 
 DOBSON [breathing heavily] 
 DOBSON [grunts] 
 ALFIE [grunting] 
 Don't do it, Vic. 
 DOBSON [grunts] 
 DOBSON [groaning in agony] 
 ALFIE [grunts] 
 Oh, my God, Vic. 
 It's alright, Shezza. 
 I'm fine. 
 The money. 
 Vic? 
 Where is he? 
 There. 
 Where the f*ck is the cash? 
 ALFIE: What the f*ck? 
 He had it a minute ago. 
 Shame about your car, Baz. 
 It's a nice moto. 
 DAVEBOY: Baz. 
 BAZZA [grunting] 
 Oh, f*ck. 
 It doesn't look good, Baz. 
 No kidding. 
 ALFIE: Never say die. 
 Keep still. 
 I'll get an ambulance. 
 Alfie. 
 Don't bother. 
 This is our ticket home if ever I saw one. 
 I'm okay with it. 
 I'm surprised I lasted this long. 
 Listen, boys. 
 You should do me one favor. 
 Don't give up. 
 You'll get to America in the end. 
 This is just a small step back. 
 Promise me you won't give up. 
 Promise. 
 I swear on my mother's grave. 
 I want to see you guys living in the sunshine somewhere. 
 I want to see you get fat, Alfie. 
 And rich... 
 ...and bald. 
 And have a fat wife and lots of fat babies. 
 Done, mate. 
 ALFIE: Come here. 
 Lie down. 
 Hey, hey, hey. 
 You alright? 
 Very comfy, thanks. 
 Just asking. 
 Does the wife have to be fat? 
 Seriously. 
 These are my dying words, boys. 
 You have to do what I say. 
 Alright. 
 Fair play. 
 Plum wife it is. 
 First daughter we have, we'll name her Bazza. 
 Hey. 
 Hey, hey, hey. 
 DAVEBOY: Brother, what should I do, eh? 
 Anything you say, eh? 
 Within reason. 
 Two things. 
 Brush your teeth more often. 
 I can do that. 
 And tell Doris Day... 
 I said...
