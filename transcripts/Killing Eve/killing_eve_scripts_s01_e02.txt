 I said it was probably a woman.   
 We think she's been operating   
 for two years across    countries.   
 She's highly skilled and, as yet, untraceable   
 and, frankly, she's starting to show off.   
 Argh!

 Don't worry, I've got another one.   
 Wear it down.    
 Oh, my God! Somebody help me!    
 - You're fired. 
- You're a dick-swab.    
 - Oi! 
- Thank you, Bill.    
 No, I was gonna call you a dick-swab!

 I believe there is a female assassin

 and she's targeted a number of influential people.     
 She doesn't have a signature, but she certainly has style     
 and I don't know who or what is behind her,     
 but I don't think she's slowing down     
 and just that interested me, I guess.     
 But also apparently makes me a fantasist     
 and a crackpot and completely on my own.     
 And, you know, frankly, I don't give a sh1t anymore.     
 She is outsmarting the smartest of us,     
 and for that, she deserves to do or kill     
 whoever the hell she wants.     
 I mean, if she's not killing me,

 Boris Ivanovich, humanitarian aid.     
 Killed in his hotel bedroom in Budapest.     
 - Why a woman? 
- He had   -hour security     
 and the only people who entered his room were hotel maids.     
 Okay.     
 Cesare Greco. Mafia. Had recently and violently     
 taken over a drug cartel in Sicily.     
 Killed at his anniversary party in Tuscany.     
 Now, his wife said she saw a blonde woman     
 wearing one of her dresses.     
 And a kid said a blonde woman was playing a game with him     
 in the same room where Greco was killed     
 with a hairpin moments later.     
 So witnesses saw a woman wearing a dress     
 and playing with children. Very suspicious.     
 Sort of ignoring the hairpin thing there.     
 Okay. But neither wife or child     
 actually witnessed the kill, so...     
 No one witnessed any of the others either.     
 - No, except for Kasia. 
- Who was full-on murdered.     
 But didn't Kasia say the killer was a brunette?     
 Oh, come on. She would have disguised herself.     
 Or it's a different person.     
 Did Forensics find anything out from the hospital kill?     
 - One full profile, but no matches. 
- Okay.     
 - Any witnesses to that kill? 
- No.     
 Any witnesses from the hospital at all?     
 There was no one in the corridor at the time of the murder     
 besides the security guards and the nurse.     
 - Who were all killed. 
- So nothing     
 - to implicate the same woman. 
- Except that Kedrin     
 was killed by a woman, and the witness to that kill     
 was then murdered, so it doesn't take a genius to put...     
 Other than that, can you give me a single discernable motive

 She's the lackey. You need to focus on who's running her.     
 - She's irrelevant. 
- She's completely relevant.     
 We have to ask what is  her  motive.     
 Either they have something on her, controlling her,     
 or they're lavishing her with something...     
 Exactly. They. Who is the they? It could be anyone.     
 That's the point. It could be Mossad for all we know.     
 If it was someone with enemies, they would have owned up to it.     
 Or been exposed for at least one of these kills by now.     
 What are you saying?     
 There are no trails.     
 If they are random, then fine, they're random.     
 But if they're not, that means someone's plan     
 is going really well.     
 These people are powerful and particular     
 and, so far, completely invisible.     
 Which means they're probably everywhere.     
 Our only visible contact is her.     
 And that is why we have to focus on everything     
 we know about her in order to get to them.     
 And what do we know?     
 Her DNA isn't on file, there's no image.     
 She's young, smart, uh, fit.     
 She must speak multiple languages.     
 She brings a certain flair to her kills.     
 Hairpin was cool.     
 You know, either they trained her     
 or they found her. Either way,     
 I'd say she scores high on the psychopathy scale.     
 And she probably killed before she was paid to.

 Tragically, he's already at the pub.     
 Okay, good. Go, and we'll catch you up.     
 [SIGHS]     
 If he lunges, it's on your head.     
 If we find out what happened to that CCTV, it'll be worth it.

 Bye-bye.     
 Hey, Frank!     
 - What a coincidence. 
- Small world.     
 Well, this is very uncomfortable.     
 Do you think you should find a new pub?     
 I just wanted to apologize for calling you a dick-swab.     
 After you fired us.     
 And me, too.     
 Yeah, well,     
 there was really nothing I could do, so...     
 I know. It's fine, Frank, really.     
 Did you actually see the CCTV, mate?     
 - What CCTV? 
- Yeah, what CCTV?     
 Of the Kedrin... assassin.     
 Did you set this up?     
 - No. 
- No, I did.     
 I just want to be really clear     
 that I wasn't asking you out out.     
 God, I'm a knob.     
 Did you think I was asking you out out?     
 No! Of course not.     
 - I just thought... 
- Oh, my God, Frank.     
 - No, I wasn't asking you out. 
- No.     
 Do you want to know what I thought?     
 I thought one person might have thought,     
 maybe one person might have asked me for a drink     
 after my wife bloody... died, and I thought, yeah,     
 I thought maybe you were that person, that kind person.     
 Oh, Jesus, Frank. I'm sorry.     
 The fact that you're still asking about all this     
 is ludicrous.     
 It's just that I spoke to the Vienna police     
 and they said there was no CCTV evidence     
 - attached to the case. 
- Yes. Fine. Yes.     
 Because I made up the bloody CCTV.     
 Wha... Uh, why?     
 - Why? 
- Because!     
 Because... it was not your investigation.     
 And taking bets on people's killers,     
 very disrespectful to the dead.     
 You should have just been doing your job.     
 - So there was never any CCTV? 
- No.     
 I was just sick of you     
 piping up with your theories     
 any time there was a sniff of conspiracy in the air.     
 You tiresome think-bucket!     
 - Easy, mate. 
- Sorry.     
 Uh...     
 Sorry.     
 I have to go and get the kids.     
 Well, that'll be in a cab, then. Come on.     
 There you go. Mm-hmm.     
 You know, what you both did today     
 was massively insensitive.     
 [MOUTHING WORDS]     
 I'm only walking you to the cab, all right?     
 God, I feel awful.

- Mm-hmm.     
 You?     
 Mm-hmm.

 They want me to trace her.     
 Sounds dangerous.     
 I know.     
 Are you sure you want to do this?     
 Yes. She's killing people.     
 And that's why you want to do it?     
 You look exhausted. Why don't you go up to bed?     
 We'll talk about it tomorrow.     
 Hmm?     
 - Okay. 
- Okay.     
 Don't stay up too late.

 Ah, congratulations. He has kind eyes.     
 Why did you lie to me?     
 There was no security.     
 I don't have to tell you.     
 - You just have to trust me. 
- [LAUGHS] No.     
 You have to trust me.     
 Okay, we can fight.     
 But you will get tired,     
 and I will get bored, and you don't like it when I'm bored.     
 If I kill you, they will just send me another one.
