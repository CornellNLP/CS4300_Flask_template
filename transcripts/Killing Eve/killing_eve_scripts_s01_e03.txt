 I believe there is   
 a female assassin operating internationally,   
 and she's targeted a number of influential people.

 A woman in London is leading a department just to find you.

 What is this?    
 - What's her name? 
- Eve Polastri.    
 EVE: There was a young woman, a nurse,    
 who left the bathroom before I did.    
 I think I've met her.    
 Her hair is dark blonde, maybe honey.    
 It was tied back.    
 Uh, she was slim, about   ,   .    
 She had very delicate features.    
 Her eyes are sort of catlike. Wide, but alert.    
 Her lips are full,    
 she has a long neck,    
 high cheek bones.    
 Skin is smooth and bright.    
 She had a lost look in her eye    
 that was both direct and also chilling.    
 She's totally focused...    
 yet almost entirely inaccessible.    
 MAN: Uh...    
 So, is that like a square face or an oval face?

 Internally, the guy was known as "Fat Panda,"     
 which is a little racist.     
 Fattist, come to that.     
 But I hear that he started it so, you know, we went along.     
 He was based in China, but over here in Berlin a lot.     
 He was popular, good leader, nice man.     
 His death has shocked a lot of people.     
 Who do you think murdered him?     
 Spoiler alert. The new autopsy report says     
 he died of a heart attack.     
 - Wait, what? 
- Doesn't that sound better?     
 The nurse who was supposed to be on duty was drugged.     
 This was a blatant assassination.     
 And by the operative I'm looking for.     
 And as the Chinese attaché,     
 I'm saying it was a heart attack.     
 Listen, the Chinese government are freaking out.     
 It's a PR nightmare. This story cannot exist.     
 What's the Chinese story?     
 The new autopsy concludes that he took the initiative himself     
 when the covering nurse left the room,     
 working the forceps to experience a shock of pain     
 that triggered a cardiac arrest.     
 Not my thing.

- Why? He's a masochist.     
 Look, kinks are totally specific.     
 It's not just about pain, it's a contract.

 Well, you go back to the gang.     
 And Tell them I'm sorry I can't be there. I'm just...     
 Saving the world.   
 Yeah, well...     
 you guys have fun.

 Is that Bill?   
 Uh, yeah.     
 Say hi from me.   
 I will.     
 Good night.     
 Night.

 - BILL: Room service. 
- Coming.     
 Coming, coming.     
 Ugh.     
 Thank you.     
 EVE ON TAPE:  Tell them I'm sorry I can't be there.

 EVE:  Uh, yeah.   
 NIKO:  Say hi from me.   
 EVE:  I will. Okay. Good night.   
 You can't wear a bra with that dress.     
 Whip it off. This is an important meeting.     
 Oh, and important meetings require women to go braless?     
 No, dresses like that require women to go braless.     
 A monkey could tell you that.     
 If he has something, you have to get it out of him.     
 Oh, please. [WINCES]     
 I haven't flirted since the late '  s.     
 - How's Niko? 
- I think he's jealous.     
 Which I like, but also find annoying.     
 Jealous of me?     
 Gosh. What does he think I'm doing here?     
 Skulking to your hotel room     
 and convincing you to take off your bra?     
 Have you ever fancied me?     
 Uh...     
 - No. 
- Hmm.     
 - You me? 
- No.     
 Hmm.     
 Well, that's a relief.     
 So, tell me what happened in Charlottenburg.     
 Everything happened.     
 - Wait. Men? 
- Yes.     
 Were you gay?     
 Uh... I just fall in love with whoever I fall in love with.     
 How many men have you been in love with?     
 - Hundreds. 
- Does Keiko know?     
 She's got her own thing going on.     
 Wait, so you guys...     
 Well... I really wanted a baby,     
 and she was rich and ovulating, so...     
 But you guys are like the perfect couple.     
 We're a good team.     
 Wow.     
 Bill.     
 Do you want to hear something really freaky?     
 What?     
 The conditions have to be just right,     
 but sometimes...     
 [WHISPERS] ...we have s*x.     
 - You dirty perverts. 
- I know.     
 [LAUGHING]     
 You ever been interested in women?     
 Uh, no. Not like that.     
 Not even ones with delicate features,     
 sort of catlike eyes     
 that are completely inaccessible?     
 That is horribly unprofessional.     
 Do you want to hear about her tits?     
 - I knew it! 
- I'm joking!     
 - I knew it! 
- Oh, come on!     
 Let's go, I'm ready. What are you going to do?     
 I'll find a bar near the restaurant.     
 I'll call you at  :   to give you an out.     
 Of course I fancy you. You're gorgeous.     
 Oh, stop it!     
 Oh, uh, walk me to the train.

 An organization has been paying him millions.     
 We don't know what for, but a week later,     
 both Fat Panda and the agent were dead.
