 Somebody's been siphoning money from the Geneva account.   
 Do you know who?

 EVE: Do you think he could actually be the accountant for The Twelve?   
 I want to find my family. 
You'll find them.    
 I can't stop thinking about you.    
 Ugh!    
 I don't want to talk about it.

 Does this look familiar?

 Do you think I'm a moron?     
 You might pretend to be working for the FSB, might pretend to be helping MI .     
 We both know what you're really working for: yourself.     
 And it's only a matter of time before they all catch up with you.     
 And you'll be dead and I'll be even more alone and miserable than I am now.     
 I will try to patch things up with your mother.

 Um...     
 ... something about a lot of money that had gone missing.     
 He'd worked out who'd taken it.     
 And...     
 [SOBS] if anything happened to him, I had to forward an email on to someone.     
 - [SNIFFS] 
- Who?     
 I didn't recognise the address.     
 It... it had some... some kind of file attached to it.     
 I just have this... feeling he was mixed up with something awful!

 Why are you lying to me?     
 I'm not.     
 I gained valuable insight into Victorian gender politics.

 Okay.

 I am just trying to save you from yourself!     
 So, bear with me if I get a little frustrated.     
 They want to meet with you.     
 Why?     
 They need to discuss your new contract, holiday pay, benefits, et cetera.     
 So, I'm getting promoted?     
 You work well, you move up.     
 In the meantime, they want you to rest, conserve your strength.     
 So... spend your money.     
 Get an ombre balayage. Enjoy yourself.     
 But no travel, okay? You stay put.

 Morning, Mum.     
 [INDISTINCT CHATTER]     
 - I didn't order this. 
- Um... consider it an olive branch.     
 Look, I was tone-deaf, and in the light of everything that's happened...     
 I'm really rather embarrassed.     
 Well, if I'd been given the proper authority from the start, we might have avoided the needless death of an innocent man.     
 But Kruger wasn't innocent, was he?     
 Thought he was embezzling money.     
 Kruger was up to his eyebrows in debt.     
 Foreclosures coming out of his bottom.     
 His actions were not that of a man with a casual   million sloshing around in his sock drawer.     
 So, he was framed?     
 How would I know?     
 I've been ordered to stay away from all of this.     
 [SIGHS]     
 Tell me what you need.     
 Well, you've changed your tune.     
 You had a close call.     
 Now, if anything had happened to you, I would have been partly responsible.     
 That's something I take very seriously.     
 Losing my husband in the divorce sent me into a grief of its own.     
 I know it's not the same thing, but I just want to say...     
 I do understand loss.     
 My office.     
 Sorry?     
 Well, that's the first thing I need.     
 [LAUGHS] But you don't even know where your office is.     
 That doesn't mean I don't need it back.

 What are you doing home at this hour of the day?     
 Why? Was I supposed to run it past you?     
 No, of... of course not. I... just...     
 It is a bit odd being here in the daytime, isn't it?     
 Whatever do you find to do with yourself?     
 Must be rather dull.     
 Not really.     
 I get up to all sorts of stuff.     
 Have you had any visitors lately?     
 Um... just my friend Lily, from university.     
 You, um... you don't know her.     
 [SIGHS]     
 [SOBS]     
 Oh, Mum!     
 Geraldine, I... I've had a very long day, and...     
 I feel so lost.     
 [SNIFFS] You know?     
 [SNIFFS] You know, you... you barely even look at me, and...     
 Nonsense. We've just had a perfectly pleasant exchange in the hall.     
 I'm trying to tell you that I'm worried about you, Mum.     
 You!     
 What for?     
 Because it's weird to carry on like this, not even saying his name, for God's sake!     
 I'm doing more for your brother than you could possibly imagine.     
 Then talk to me about it.     
 Let me in.     
 If you and I are to inhabit this space together, Geraldine, we have to respect each other.     
 Our privacy and our grief.     
 I dare say there are things you don't tell me.     
 Though perhaps for quite different reasons.     
 Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm going upstairs for a lie-down.
