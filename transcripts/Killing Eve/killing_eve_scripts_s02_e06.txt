 Villanelle is for hire. 
  Let's hire her. 
  I can't tell if you're joking. 
  - She murdered Bill. 
  - I'll ask Carolyn to move you. 
  - Are you sacking me? 
  - [EVE] 
  I need your help with something important. 
  - I'm expensive. 
  - Are you now? 
  Who ordered the hits on Alister Peel? 
  Monster! 
  - It was his son - classic. 
  - Aaron Peel? 
  That's not right. 
  Someone's got something mixed up. 
  Gemma, this is Eve, my wife. 
  I don't know why they're even still married. 
  - Niko! 
  - She stabbed you? 
  Didn't she tell you? 
  Smell ya later.

  [WIND HOWLING] 
  [CLATTERING] 
  [THUNDER RUMBLES] 
  [SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC] 
  Niko! 
  My God, what are you doing out there? 
  She came to see me. 
  She told me what you did. 
  I know you stabbed her. 
  You can't believe her. 
  She's a liar. 
  I know. 
  But I do believe her. 
  - I can explain. 
  - Can you? 
  - Well? 
  - [EVE GASPS] 
  Niko! 
  Did you like it? 
  Do you like all of this? 
  Does it excite you? 
  - Ow! 
  - What do you want from me, Eve? 
  Do you want me to love you or do you want me to frighten you? 
  I don't know. 
  [SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC] 
  Now go upstairs. 
  There's something about The way you are That makes me There's something about The way you are [MUSIC PLAYING] 
  [FLOORBOARDS CREAKING] 
  This feels like a one-night stand. 
  Yeah? 
  Oh, look Hey. 
  I'm just really not looking for a relationship right now. 
  - Last night - Was amazing. 
  - Um - What? 
  I was up all night trying to work out why I felt so unbelievably shitty and sad. 
  What do you But why did you - I thought you enjoyed it? 
  - I did. 
  I loved it. 
  So then? 
  - W-what's going on? 
  - I asked you When you got back from Paris, I wanted to talk to you. 
  - You wouldn't have understood. 
  - You're wrong. 
  - No, I'm not. 
  - I guess we'll never know. 
  - I gotta go. 
  - Wait. 
  Don't ask me to stay. 
  I can't do this anymore. 
  Niko, please, it's just Let's talk. 
  But don't leave me alone! 
  But you're not alone, are you? 
  [DOOR OPENS] 
  [DOOR SLAMS] 
  Oh, God. 
  She hasn't got married again, has she? 
  Don't worry. 
  I'm just a house guest. 
  You want some drachona? 
  Eggs, sour cream. 
  Very healthy. 
  - Restorative. 
  - Not for me. 
  - Thanks. 
  - Ah, you've met. 
  [SNIFFS] 
  Good. 
  John's over from Nairobi. 
  He works at the bureau there. 
  We're old friends. 
  We are old friends too. 
  Carolyn has old friends everywhere. 
  It's so good to be back here. 
  All old friends. 
  Old friends together. 
  [WHISK CLATTERS AGAINST GLASS] 
  [MUSIC FROM TV] 
  [MAN ON TV] 
  Coming up next time on Auction Fever, there's something for everybody at a sale of seized goods and liquidated assets. 
  You'll be astonished at what goes under the hammer. 
  [THE DELMONAS] 
  "Dangerous Charms" I've been looking at you For quite some time It should come as no surprise I've been wanting you as mine I've been looking at you Your dangerous charms It seems that you can be caught in all those arms I keep falling for your dangerous charms Oh, dangerous charms I've seen you, darling Glancing at me I've seen your wicked, wicked eyes Please. 
  - Thank you. 
  - My pleasure. 
  Hello, Eve. 
  Morning. 
  This is an obvious breakfast choice. 
  I can't stand breakfast. 
  It's just constant eggs. 
  Why? 
  Who decided? 
  Did you pick up, uh Aaron Peel? 
  Mm no. 
  - Not quite yet. 
  - Not yet? 
  Why? 
  He had his father killed. 
  Playing the long game, Eve. 
  This was taken with a hidden micro camera by a journalist. 
  No, I thought he didn't do press? 
  [CAROLYN] 
  He likes playing games, though. 
  [MAN] 
  Mr. Peel, what do you say to the criticism of you that your control of vast amounts of private surveillance data gives you too much power and influence? 
  You're not averse to a bit of surveillance yourself. 
  - What do you mean? 
  - Don't play me for a fool. 
  - The camera in your bag. 
  - What? 
  You like recording things you shouldn't, don't you? 
  - Uh - Don't turn it off. 
  This is gonna be fun. 
  Let's see. 
  What choice little titbit could I share with your employers? 
  [MAN] 
  What's going on? 
  [PEEL] 
  How about the S&M sessions - you have with your wife? 
  - [MAN] 
  I'm sorry? 
  [PEEL] 
  She does laugh about it with her friends. 
  How do you know about that? 
  There is nothing hidden that will not be revealed. 
  We need to speak to this guy. 
  Bit late for that. 
  [EVE] 
  Peel had him killed? 
  [CAROLYN] 
  A sewer underneath Farringdon. 
  "Urban explorer overreached himself" is the official story. 
  My brother used to jam his hamsters into an old loo roll, prod them through with a toothbrush, see how many he could do in a minute. 
  - How many could he? 
  - Three. 
  There's a Pharaday conference being held in Rome. 
  Two weeks from now. 
  You need to make sure that we're there with him. 
  [PIPE BUBBLES] 
  Getting someone close to Peel's about as easy as getting a s*x offender into a convent. 
  - So quite easy, then? 
  - You know what I mean. 
  He doesn't have any friends. 
  He's never had a girlfriend, or boyfriend, or anatomically correct s*x robot. 
  He's paranoid. 
  It's not like someone can just swan in in a tight dress. 
  Can't they? 
  Well, it can't be me, I've already met him. 
  [JESS] 
  There's got to be someone. 
  Tell Carolyn it was your idea. 
  Fine. 
  [BUZZER SOUNDS] 
  [FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING] 
  So Carolyn's forgiven you, then? 
  We have forgiven each other. 
  Have you come here to yell at me? 
  For selling me out and skipping town with Villanelle? 
  No. 
  No, not at all, I'd forgotten about it. 
  It's totally fine. 
  Ah, you're not yelling but it feels like you're yelling. 
  We want to make you and Villanelle an offer. 
  Which doesn't involve killing someone. 
  Hm. 
  [DOOR CREAKS] 
  Hi, partner. 
  Welcome to my new home. 
  How's it going with Niko? 
  None of your business. 
  You want me not to kill someone? 
  You do know what I do, right? 
  - This is harder - a challenge. 
  - [VILLANELLE GROANS] 
  I don't like to be challenged. 
  - Do you want me to ask someone else? 
  - No! 
  Good. 
  So, Aaron Peel. 
  Aaron doesn't like people. 
  The only relationship he has is with his sister Amber. 
  So we use her to get to him. 
  She's going to A. A. 
  meetings in London. 
  Clever. 
  So [SIGHS] 
  What do you want? 
  Gap year tragedy, who who fell in love with her coke dealer. 
  [IN AUSTRALIAN ACCENT] 
  A suncream heiress from Sydney who has her own, like, super successful bikini brand. 
  No? 
  I know. 
  [IN US ACCENT] 
  She's just arrived from New York after one too many nights on the wrong side of the bridge. 
  And she has a really, really, really annoying accent. 
  I like her accent. 
  What's her name? 
  Billie. 
  Billie? 
  Oh, Kenny, could you make a start on Billie's social media presence. 
  It needs to be watertight, so backdate it. 
  Go way back. 
  Aaron will check on anyone who comes near them. 
  Hugo. 
  - What? 
  - You called me Kenny. 
  Oh, did I? 
  Sorry. 
  Um give her a job. 
  You know what? 
  No, no job. 
  A couple of vanity degrees. 
  Something wishy-washy. 
  - Philosophy, History of Art? 
  - Great. 
  Throw in a couple of D. U. I. s and don't make her too clean. 
  Smart. 
  One rich insta-hotty coming up. 
  This operation is strictly Moscow Rules. 
  Cold War, analogue. 
  No messages, no calls, no emails. 
  We have to act on the assumption that Aaron will be watching and recording everything, including his sister, so no breaking cover. 
  Not even for a second. 
  You're the real boss, aren't you? 
  - Villanelle - Ssh. 
  Eve. 
  Don't be disrespectful. 
  Please, Carolyn. 
  Yes I am. 
  [DOOR CLOSES] 
  Ah, Eve, Villanelle. 
  Here's our quartermaster. 
  - Hello, sir. 
  - Morning. 
  Do I get a watch with a laser in it? 
  I've been doing this now for 17 years. 
  Do you know how often these jokes get made? 
  - A lot. 
  - Never. 
  Field agents approach their work with the solemnity it warrants. 
  [BRIEFCASE IS OPENED] 
  Grain-of-wheat microphone. 
  Piggybacks on the G. P. S. 
  signal from your phone, even when dormant. 
  In a handbag, hanging in a cloakroom. 
  Just appears as an ordinary G. P. S. 
  That is so cool! 
  - Eve! 
  - That is What? 
  Professional. 
  I'm so sorry. 
  Thanks. 
  Okay, mate? 
  - This Niko stuff? 
  - Oh, don't It'll pass. 
  He'll come around. 
  Nothing a B. J. and a compliment won't fix in my experience. 
  - See you back at the office. 
  - Alright. 
  - What are you doing here? 
  - Don't think a B. J. will help. 
  - Don't. 
  - He's too nice. 
  He's too normal for you, you know that. 
  - Stop it. 
  - Why? 
  Because 'cause you will never understand how much harder it is to be nice and normal and decent than it is to be like you. 
  Like us, you mean. 
  If I was going to date it it was when Mum died. 
  I'm not blaming, but that is when it started getting really out of control. 
  I didn't know where I'd been. 
  There were whole days just missing - total blackout. 
  I had to piece everything together with whatever was at the bottom of my bag - receipts, drugs I found a pair of pants once. 
  Not mine, no idea. 
  [MAN] 
  Thank you, Amber. 
  Would anyone else like to speak? 
  [IN AMERICAN ACCENT] 
  Yeah, I would. 
  Um I'm Billie. 
  Hi, Billie. 
  And I'm an addict. 
  Uh cocaine and alcohol primarily, but, honestly [TUTS] 
  whatever I can get. 
  I recognize a lot of what Amber was saying. 
  I wish I was better. 
  A better person. 
  Because it is so much harder to be nice and normal and decent than it is to be like this. 
  I hurt someone when I was in Paris. 
  My husband just left. 
  He couldn't take it. 
  He can't handle me anymore. 
  He's too nice. 
  And my best friend was killed in an accident. 
  It was my fault. 
  I have nobody left. 
  Well, almost nobody. 
  And that's my story, I guess. 
  Poor me. 
  Poor me. 
  Pour me a drink. 
  [CHUCKLES] 
  Excuse me? 
  Just, um Just careful with the self-pity. 
  Uh Did you Did you hear my story? 
  My best friend just died. 
  My husband has left me. 
  - I'm having a really awful time. 
  - [WOMAN] 
  Hey! 
  We've all played the blame game. 
  Carleen, did you want to speak? 
  What would you like to share with the group? 
  - [CARLEEN] 
  Hi, everyone. 
  - [GROUP] 
  Hi, Carleen. 
  [SARCASTICALLY] 
  Hey! 
  - Tough crowd. 
  - Yeah. 
  - Really tough. 
  - It's hard. 
  But it gets easier. 
  You just You have to be honest. 
  I was being honest. 
  Were you? 
  Look, these guys have seen it all. 
  We're all here for the same reason. 
  The group can smell bullshit from a mile away. 
  Amber, time to go. 
  - The car's outside. 
  - Thanks, Marie. 
  - See you tomorrow. 
  - See you tomorrow. 
  Don't be mad. 
  - Don't you ever do that again. 
  - Do what again? 
  If you ever use me or my life again, this is over. 
  You asked me to come work for you, remember? 
  Did you even read the A. A. briefing I gave you? 
  Yeah. 
  Because if you had, you'd know the first rule is honesty. 
  How can I be honest when I'm being a different person? 
  Aren't you always a different person? 
  Aren't you? 
  At least I'm good at playing someone else. 
  Not that good, obviously. 
  Don't speak to me like that, Eve. 
  I like you but I don't like you that much. 
  [SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC] 
  Don't forget. 
  The only thing that makes you interesting is me. 
  We'll try again in the morning. 
  [BELL RINGS] 
  - Cheer you up. 
  - Okay. 
  [SIGHS] 
  Does anyone else have anything they want to say? 
  I would. 
  Go ahead, Billie, when you're ready. 
  I have real trouble telling the truth. 
  I don't understand the concept, actually, but But somebody told me it was important, so here goes. 
  Most of the time most days, I feel nothing. 
  I don't feel anything. 
  It is so boring. 
  I wake up and I think, "Again? 
  Really? 
  I have to do this again?" And what I really don't understand is, how come everybody else isn't screaming with boredom too? 
  I'm just trying to find ways of making myself feel something. 
  More and more and more but it doesn't make any difference. 
  No matter what I do, I don't feel anything, I I hurt myself, it doesn't hurt. 
  I buy what I want, I don't want it. 
  I do what I like, I don't I don't like it. 
  I'm just so bored. 
  I think we can all relate to that. 
  Wow! 
  What you said there was so powerful. 
  It's not easy. 
  I've never really tried it before. 
  Yeah, me either. 
  Hey, are you in London? 
  - I mean, living here. 
  - Right now, yeah. 
  - Would you - Pardon me. 
  I'm sorry, Amber. 
  Allow me to remind you of the terms of your agreement. 
  That you form no associations with anyone in these rooms. 
  - For your own wellbeing. 
  - Yeah, yeah. 
  - It's okay, we were just - Perhaps collect your things. 
  I'll see you outside in five minutes. 
  Sure. 
  [SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC] 
  [MOUTHS] 
  You need to give Amber some space. 
  This is none of your business. 
  Back off. 
  Hey, I'm going through a really difficult time at the moment. 
  I'm just I'm sorry, okay? 
  [HORN BLARES, HEAVY THUD] 
  [BRAKES SQUEALING] 
  [SCREAMING] 
  Don't go out with strangers [AMBER SHRIEKS AND SOBS] 
  What if I don't really know how I feel? 
  And besides The words only get in the way Eve? 
  You heard? 
  About the traffic accident? 
  Yes, tragic. 
  Carolyn, it was Very upsetting. 
  Yes, I'm sure. 
  Has contact been made between Villanelle and Amber Peel? 
  They've been texting. 
  Good. 
  Well, that's something, then. 
  Keep me informed of any developments. 
  [MAN] 
  Again. 
  - Who are you texting? 
  - Eve. 
  Why? 
  She might be lonely. 
  [MESSAGE ALERT] 
  [SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC] 
  - [MESSAGE ALERT] 
  - Ah! 
  It's Amber. 
  [AS AMBER] 
  "Hey, you free Thursday? 
  Wanna come for family sups?" What? 
  Why do rich people talk like children? 
  [DOORBELL CHIMES] 
  [MAN] 
  I'll get it. 
  Eve. 
  What are you doing here? 
  I said I'd come pick my stuff up. 
  No, it's fine, I was passing, so - How did you get the address? 
  - I called the school. 
  I wanted to be helpful. 
  Eve! 
  Hello. 
  Eve was just dropping some things off. 
  Well, that's so nice. 
  Um Well, do you want to come in, have a cuppa? 
  - I'm sure Eve's busy. 
  - No, I'm not. 
  I'd love to. 
  [DOOR SLAMS] 
  What a lovely house! 
  Oh, thank you. 
  It was my grandmother's. 
  I wouldn't be able to afford this on a teacher's salary. 
  [BOTH CHUCKLE NERVOUSLY] 
  [WATER RUNNING] 
  How's work? 
  It's really good, actually. 
  Really good. 
  Villanelle keeping you busy? 
  Yeah. 
  Looks like we're both pretty busy. 
  With work. 
  [GEMMA HUMS NERVOUSLY] 
  - Can I use your bathroom? 
  - Yes. 
  - It's um - Upstairs? 
  Mm. 
  Thank you. 
  [NIKO CHUCKLES] 
 
 
 
  [SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC] 
  Aww. 
  [MUSIC BOX PLAYS] 
  Eve? 
  - What are you doing? 
  - I was just, um No, I I understand that things between you and Niko are tough. 
  But I'd really rather you didn't drag me into this. 
  Oh, really? 
  You don't want to get dragged in? 
  Niko? 
  - Are you scared? 
  - No, of course not. 
  What's happened? 
  Um Eve what are you doing? 
  What are you doing, Niko? 
  Gemma has a sofa bed. 
  I'm sleeping downstairs. 
  That's not what I asked. 
  I'd like you to apologize. 
  - No, really, it's fine. 
  - Gemma is my friend. 
  You remember friends, don't you? 
  There's nothing going on here. 
  You're right. 
  There's nothing going on here. 
  I hope you like the missionary position. 
  I do, actually. 
  You'll be happy here. 
  I dread to think where you'll be happy, Eve. 
  Oh, my clothes! 
  Ohh! 
  [DRAWER IS PUSHED SHUT] 
  [IN HOMELY VOICE] 
  Ooh, a little bit of Bisto. 
  [IN HOMELY VOICE] 
  A little bit of Bisto. 
  A little bit of Bisto, please! 
  A little bit of Bisto. 
  Mm. 
  Mm. 
  Thank 'oo. 
  [AMBER] 
  Where are you living, Billie? 
  - Ahhh, in Shoreditch. 
  - Mm, cool. 
  And do you work? 
  Mm not really. 
  I was interning at a start-up but it was pretty intense. 
  Mm. 
  A failed intern. 
  How inspirational. 
  - Aaron. 
  - [VILLANELLE CHUCKLES] 
  Well, I couldn't do a job like yours. 
  Running a huge company? 
  No wonder you're selling it. 
  How did you know I was selling it? 
  [CRUNCHES AND CHEWS] 
  I I read an article. 
  In The Economist? 
  Interested in business, are you? 
  No offense, but you, uh don't seem the type. 
  It was on the magazine pile at the waxing salon. 
  [CHUCKLES] 
  [SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE] 
  What is that? 
  Turkish? 
  Greek. 
  Some kind of Greek. 
  He's trying to provoke her. 
  They need to be more careful. 
  Ignore him, he's an asshole. 
  Where is the bathroom? 
  [WATER LAPPING, BIRD CALLS] 
  [EVE] 
  Okay, Villanelle, see if you can find his office. 
  Um look for any hidden correspondence, written proof of interest in the sale I'm trying to think what else. 
  What else? 
  And then get back. 
  And don't take too long. 
  Lost? 
  - [CHEWS NOISILY] 
  - [VILLANELLE] 
  No. 
  Obviously not. 
  I'm being nosey. 
  [CHUCKLES] 
  You read all these? 
  The loo's that way. 
  Try not to be too "nosey" on your way back. 
  It's not polite. 
  [EVE] 
  It's okay. 
  Just don't let him see that he's rattled you. 
  [EVE SIGHS] 
  He doesn't like people who stand up to him. 
  [KONSTANTIN] 
  Maybe he does like it. 
  [EVE] 
  I don't think so. 
  Oh, popcorn. 
  I just wish we could see her. 
  - Stop smothering her. 
  - I'm not. 
  [AMBER] 
  Right, I'll give you that much. 
  But, no. 
  [AARON] 
  You know how I like it. 
  [SLURPS] 
  [EXHALES] 
  I think I'm gonna do mine as a rhyme. 
  - [AARON] 
  Mm. 
  - [SIGHS] 
  If I go up, I'll only fall But should I slide o r should I crawl? 
  - Interesting. 
  - Sorry, what's happening? 
  Well, just choose which card from your hand you think accords with Amber's charming piece of doggerel and hand it to her face down. 
  Doggerel? 
  Just pick any one. 
  Is this something you two always do? 
  - Mm? 
  - Play games together? 
  Meaning? 
  Uh nothing. 
  I was just asking. 
  You ask a lot of questions. 
  You seem to have the mind of a five-year-old. 
  A-Face, why are you being so mean? 
  She's my friend. 
  I wouldn't classify as a friend someone I once sat next to - in a toilet stall. 
  - Wow. 
  - That's not how - You're struggling with the rules of Dixit, a simple storytelling game for players aged eight and upwards, and yet you claim to have two philosophy degrees. 
  - I do have two philosophy degrees. 
  - I know. 
  I checked. 
  Fine. 
  Which is why I'm puzzled with this whole faux ditz act. 
  One part of the equation doesn't add up. 
  [VILLANELLE] 
  I'm sorry. 
  Please remind me. 
  What exactly did you study again? 
  General Philosophy and Social Policy and Philosophy of Religion. 
  Ah, Philosophy of Religion. 
  Fascinating. 
  Where do you stand on Anselm's Ontological Argument? 
  Is there just the smallest chance she read the file? 
  [AARON] 
  Well, come on, then. 
  Villanelle - Anselm's Ontological Argument. 
  Uhm. 
  Tell him the classic version is your favorite. 
  It's perfectly simple. 
  Where do you stand on it? 
  That it's boring. 
  Oh, we can do better than that. 
  What's your favorite refutation? 
  Say Thomas Aquinas. 
  I think she has taken her earpiece out. 
  What? 
  [AARON] 
  I'm waiting. 
  Drop it, Aaron. 
  Please stop. 
  The grown-ups are talking, Amber. 
  If it bored you you must have studied it, so you can at least detail the argument for it. 
  I mean, it's first-year stuff. 
  Even this thickie would be able to follow it. 
  So what's the first premise? 
  Or can you at least tell us what ontological means? 
  Can you even spell it? 
  [SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC] 
  Here you are. 
  If you're going to lie at least do a bit of research. 
  Oh, I get it. 
  You're a bully. 
  [CLOCK TICKING] 
  Mm. 
  Why would I even bother to have a conversation with someone like you? 
  What is the point? 
  My dad taught me that there is only one way to communicate with a bully. 
  - [AARON] 
  I see. 
  - Mm. 
  And what was his advice? 
  [VILLANELLE CHUCKLES] 
  [AARON GROANS] 
  What just happened? 
  - My nose is bleeding. 
  - That mystery's solved. 
  - Forget it. 
  - Don't. 
  Let her cool off. 
  You are all over her. 
  [EVE SIGHS] 
  Oh, my God. 
  Well, that's it, then. 
  It's over.

  Can I get you anything? 
  - What is in that? 
  - Sorry? 
  What is in that thing? 
  Oh, lamb mainly. 
  - Mainly? 
  - Yeah. 
  But you can put any meat in there? 
  I guess so, yeah.

  Anything? 
  Really?

  How much of the day do you spend thinking about her? 
  - Most of it. 
  - Why'd you befriend my sister? 
  [CAROLYN] 
  This is your operation, your responsibility. 
  - I know. 
  - I hate to be strict but she really mustn't kill anyone. 
  You don't know if you're telling the truth or not? 
  Not really. 
  You've already done enough, Gemma. 
  I can always do more. 
  - Don't go to Rome. 
  - What? 
  [CAROLYN] 
  Rome is crucial, Eve.

  Are you planning something? 
  Because if something happens, you are on your own.
