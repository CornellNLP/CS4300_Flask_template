 KONSTANTIN: Eve... she is alive.   
 It's not possible.   
 Poor Kenny.   
 I can't let people know I'm looking into things.   
 EVE: I have Kenny's phone.   
 - We just guessed it was you. 
- What?!   
 VILLANELLE: They are making me a Keeper.   
 They want you to work with somebody first.   
 - [HONKS BICYCLE HORN] 
- BOTH: Bonjour !    
 DASHA: Management is not easy.    
 It's watching someone do job worse than you.    
 I deserve more. More than you.    
 JAMIE: What was Kenny working on before he died?    
 EVE: There's a thumb drive. 
The police have it.    
 I need to know what happened, who killed him.

 CAROLYN: And what about the coroner's report?    
 There's no signs of a struggle.    
 No evidence of asphyxiation or internal injury.    
 Basically, he was absolutely fine until he...    
 - ... hit the ground. 
- May I?    
 So...    
 ... the head of the MPS is still saying it's suicide, despite the lack of note or motivation.    
 That is reassuring.    
 It'd be really unsettling if he actually got something right.    
 EVE: Geraldine said I could come straight in...    
 Oh.    
 Wow!    
 Oh, get over it, Eve.    
 I have all my best thoughts in the bath.    
 If Mo can manage, you can.    
 I haven't looked up in    minutes.    
 [DOORBELL RINGS]    
 Did you get Kenny's thumb drive back from the police?    
 - At quite a cost, yes. 
- I'd rather not know.    
 - Oh, I'll... I'll meet you downstairs. 
- JAMIE: Oh!    
 Who's that?    
 Our Bitter Pill representative.    
 I invited him.    
 Before I knew this meeting was in a bathroom.    
 - [EVE CLOSES DOOR] 
- [RATTLES ICE]    
 Mo, would you just pass me a towel, please?    
 So, we have the burner phone and the thumb drive.    
 What else do we have to go on?    
 Excellent. Good meeting.    
 - Meetings have biscuits. 
- You can have a biscuit when you tell me what the point of you is.     
 Planning on analysing those yourself, then, are you?     
 I think the world's foremost intelligence agency might handle it.     
 What, that public school, what-ho-ing, old boy's network?     
 I don't think a beer fridge and a beanbag breakout area gives you any great insight into global politics.     
 - That's... 
- Enough, okay? Enough!     
 Carolyn, you and Mo take the phone, we'll take the...     
 ... thumb thingy.     
 'Cause you know what we do from now on?     
 - We share. 
- GERALDINE: Wow.     
 That is literally the most parenting this household has ever seen.     
 - [BABY GRIZZLES] 
- DASHA: So, you thought this was good idea?     
 I'm practising my characters, like you told me.     
 Young mother and baby... and Grandma.     
 What got into you? You have been unfocused and manic for days.     
 I'm just having some fun.     
 [BABY CRIES]     
 Stop that. I don't like it.     
 [GRIZZLES]     
 You would think, after your last managerial disaster, you would learn to keep your head down.     
 It is not my fault he was an idiot.     
 I keep telling them to look harder for good recruits.     
 - But what can you do? 
- [THUD]     
 Eh...     
 [LAUGHS]     
 [LAUGHS]     
 You think that's funny?!     
 [GASPS AND LAUGHS]     
 I'll show you what's funny. 
You come with me, because I've had enough.     
 [BABY CRIES]     
 [LAUGHS]     
 [LAUGHS]     
 Now, that is funny.     
 [LAUGHS]     
 You want to amuse yourself, go crazy.     
 But I will not have you put both of our futures at risk.     
 - I'm the one doing all the work. 
- You think handling you isn't work?     
 Why you think no-one else is prepared to do it?     
 - [BABY CRIES] 
- Bad pension scheme?     
 You should get your act together.     
 You know? Jobs will get tougher.     
 And they will not let you get away with being sloppy.     
 Sloppy? Hmm...     
 [BABY CRIES]     
 No.     
 "No"? What do you mean, "No"?     
 It's too soon.     
 I have to prepare.     
 - I'm not ready. How about that? 
- [SIREN WAILS]     
 Not ready for London?     
 All you need is anorak and face like cheese.     
 [DISTRESSED SHOUTING IN SPANISH]     
 You're right.     
 You're right. I know what I'm doing.     
 I can handle this.     
 [DISTRESSED SHOUTING IN SPANISH CONTINUES]     
 [BABY CRIES]     
 This is bank stuff.     
 Financial data.     
 Oh, he said something about accounts.     
 Damn it. What was it?     
 [PACKET RUSTLES]     
 Do you want one?     
 What? Oh... No, I... No.     
 Once I pop, I just can't stop.     
 You can. It's just about self-control.     
 But I don't have any self-control.     
 All these are different accounts, in different locations.     
 One of them must have meant something to Kenny.     
 That one is different.     
 Mm.     
 R-U-R'.     
 Code, maybe?     
 It is. Where's, um... ?     
 Where's that Rubik's Cube?     
 The only way I can solve this is by taking off all the stickers.     
 No, we don't need to solve it.     
 It's cube notation.     
 He's told us what to do.     
 Okay, um, turn it right face,    degrees clockwise.     
 Is that supposed to mean something to me?     
 No.     
 Okay. Uh, U.     
 Upwards,    degrees.     
 - R'. 
- Right face, anti-clockwise.     
 U .     
 And F'.     
 That's it.     
 "Shh... nap."     
 "Shnap".     
 Panda.     
 Kenny named the account 'Panda'.     
 Kenny and I were looking into an international organi...     
 Okay, but before I go on, you have to understand that once I tell you about them, your lives are in danger.     
 - Then don't tell us... 
- They're called The Twelve.     
 And they've infiltrated governments and organizations all over the world.     
 We don't know what their endgame is, but we do know they've been responsible for a significant number of international murders.     
 Okay, now, Fat Panda was a Chinese intelligence officer killed in Berlin.     
 He was tracking a double agent for The Twelve who was being paid from a bank account in...     
 ... the Cayman Islands.     
 Right.     
 The double agent was an MI  officer named Frank Haleton.     
 What happened to Frank?     
 He lost his knob...     
 ... and his life.     
 In that order?     
 Well, The Twelve wanted a hit on him, but the... [CHUCKLES]     
 ... but the assassin was...     
 - ... she had a flair for... 
- She?     
 The account went dormant after Frank's death, but Kenny found it was active again.     
 Three bank transfers in the last two months, totalling just over six million euros.     
 And the remaining balance moved to an account in Geneva.     
 So, who owns the Geneva account?     
 We don't know.     
 We need someone who can get into some very classified banking info.     
 Yes, we do.     
 - No, we do not go to them. 
- Yes, we do.     
 The thing is we can't trace the account.     
 Well, yeah. You don't set up an account in Geneva for transparency.     
 But you could trace it, right?     
 I thought you were looking into the phone.     
 That was the deal, wasn't it?     
 Or did Charlie Big Potatoes change his mind because he didn't get a Hobnob.     
 - Come on. We're in this together. 
- Are we?     
 Because no-one else is having to work at MI whilst moonlighting for Carolyn, and now you want me to trace...     
 Did you take this job thinking it would be easier?     
 If you did, quit now, 'cause it's only getting tougher.     
 I'll see what I can do.     
 Great.     
 Oh, and, uh...     
 That's who we think has been on their hit-list so far.     
 You know, I've been going through the MI  case files you and Kenny worked on.     
 You really should have some kind of protection. You know that, right?     
 Do you have any idea what happens to people who are protected by MI ?     
 What?     
 [LAUGHING] It's not good.     
 [INTERCOM BUZZES]     
 - Charles Kruger. 
- It's me.     
 - Who's me? 
- Just let me in.     
 [DOOR LOCK BUZZES]     
 Na zdorovie.     
 Ah!     
 Look at us, Kostya. We're old.     
 The kids are all grown up.     
 I'm going to see my son's graduation next month.     
 This modern dance is... is so visceral!     
 Have you ever locked and popped, Kostya?     
 [CHUCKLES] No! You'd, uh, displace a hip these days.     
 Hey? [CHUCKLES] Wouldn't you?     
 You wanted to see me.     
 Yeah.     
 Um...     
 Somebody's been siphoning money from the Geneva account.     
 I managed to retrieve what's left, but a pretty sizeable chunk's been taken.     
 How much has gone?     
 Uh, six million, in total.     
 Whew!     
 - Do you know who? 
- No.     
 Not yet. But I will find the person responsible.     
 I'll make some calls, see what I can find.     
 Uh, the money, Konstantin.     
 I... I prefer the money.     
 If you could...     
 ... tide me over.     
 You know, just buys me some time till I find the scoundrel.     
 - Okay. 
- [EXHALES] Thank you.     
 Thank you.     
 How's Irina these days? 
Still a little sh1t?     
 She's like a little sh1t taking a sh1t on a big sh1t.     
 Three sh1t combined into one enormous sh1t.     
 That's wonderful! [LAUGHS]

 I want to make people gag with it.     
 Can you do that for me?     
 Well...     
 ... we have some lovely floral fragrances for ladies over here.     
 The iris, in particular,     
 - is a very powerful... 
- Maybe I should describe to you what I'm thinking.     
 Let me get a pen.     
 Hmm.     
 I want to smell like a Roman centurion...     
 ... who's coming across an old foe...     
 ... who, in battle, once...     
 ... hurt him greatly.     
 Oh, but since then, the Roman centurion has become...     
 ... Emperor...     
 ... and is now powerful beyond measure.     
 Maybe something more woody.     
 Mm.     
 GERALDINE: I think it's wonderful you're letting people in.     
 We all need intimacy in our lives.     
 Even people who keep secrets for a living.     
 Nonsense, there are monks in China who go years without seeing another human being.     
 They probably have different kind of...     
 Emily Brontë. Hardly left the house.     
 Mum...     
 ... I'm proud of you for trying something new.     
 Dating is scary, but...     
 ... pushing ourselves out of our comfort zones is how we grow.     
 You know what's scary, Geraldine, is how much I regret telling you it's a date.     
 I'm so happy you're doing something for you.     
 Kenny would be too.     
 - [EARRING CLATTERS] 
- He always wanted you to meet some...     
 Here, let me...     
 No, it's better without it.     
 And don't talk about Stalin.     
 He's strictly third date.

 It must be, what    years?     
 Yeah.     
 Yeah,   , it must be.     
     's the year I got divorced.     
 - Oh, yes. 
- Yeah, yeah.     
 Yeah.     
 For the first time.     
 [BOTH LAUGH]     
 - Well... 
- Yeah.     
 If it makes you feel any better, I've just had the novel experience of being stood up.     
 No... What?!     
 Surely... You?!     
 Don't worry. I'll have him killed.     
 [LAUGHS]     
 Listen, you, um...     
 Do you want to get something to eat?     
 [LAUGHTER]     
 What about your charming friends?     
 Hmm? They disgust me. Come on.     
 Come on. What do you fancy? Seafood?     
 - Oh... [LAUGHS] 
- Steak? No?     
 There is one thing...

 [SIREN WAILS]     
 - [CAROLYN GROANS] 
- Is she okay?     
 The official line is migraine.     
 I'm having an aura, Eve.     
 It's probably stress-related.     
 You know a great cure for that?     
 Paracetamol.     
 Did you find out who owns the account?     
 Yes.     
 It's a   -year-old sugar-beet farmer in East Anglia.     
 MO: Who died nine years ago.     
 The real owner... is this guy.     
 Charles Kruger.     
 Born Sergei Korchmarev in East Berlin.     
 CAROLYN: And who was very gorgeous in his day.     
 Oh, another one of your Cold War boyfriends, Carolyn?     
 Don't be ridiculous, Eve.     
 - We barely had a night together. 
- Yeah, we get it.     
 You had a great time in the '  s.     
 So, Korchmarev disappeared from Russia around     , eventually showing up in London and presenting himself as amiable accountant Charles Kruger.     
 Do you think he could actually be the accountant for The Twelve?     
 I'm thinking he's definitely worth a visit to Kensington.     
 - I'll head right there. 
- And do what?     
 Wait in the car with a bottle of pop and a bag of crisps?     
 Be hard enough to get him to talk to me.     
 He's definitely not gonna talk to somebody he doesn't know.     
 - Are you sure? 
- Of course I'm sure.     
 I know how he operates, Eve.     
 No, I mean...     
 ... this is different, remember?     
 I'm gonna have a shower.     
 Oh, God...     
 Oh...     
 First Henrik, then Sergei.     
 It's not fun, Eve,     
 using people you once loved.     
 It's all rather painful, really.     
 Do you believe a word of that?     
 No, I think she loves it.

 EVE: Villanelle said she wasn't here for me.     
 So, let's just think who The Twelve would want to murder, aside from me.     
 Right. Okay.     
 - Possible assassin targets. 
- Oh, my God.     
 - What? 
- Carolyn. It's Carolyn.     
 They must know we found their accountant.     
 So, after you came to England, what did you do?     
 An éclair?     
 [SCOFFS]     
 Well, that won't get you that three-book deal, Sergei.     
 Tell me what you're going to wear at your son's graduation.     
 It's next month, isn't it?     
 Tell me how he does that thing with his shoulders.     
 [PHONE RINGS]     
 [EXHALES]     
 She's not picking up.     
 [SIGHS] Try mine.     
 [DIALS]     
 Should I share what I think happened when you swapped the Stasi for HMRC?     
 I think you accepted a job from The Twelve, like the money-grabbing bottom-feeder you are.     
 Am I warm?     
 - [BEEPING] 
- They're on a stake-out!     
 Who doesn't answer their phone on a stake-out?!     
 [SIREN BLEEPS]     
 Uh-oh.     
 What's going on?     
 Nothin'.     
 Just everyone look innocent.

 REPORTER: [ON TV] The husband of classical musician and influential political campaigner Isabel Fernandez, was, this afternoon, reunited with his baby who had been missing since Mrs. Fernandez was found dead at her home yesterday.     
 [WOMAN SPEAKS SPANISH ON TV]     
 He's so happy.     
 [SIGHS]     
 I'm fine.     
 There's no need for...

 ... pour me a whiskey, Geraldine?     
 Yes, of course.

 [LAUGHS]     
 Don't wait for me in the dark like that!     
 It's rude!     
 It's bad for my heart.     
 [CHUCKLES SOFTLY]     
 Don't you want to know why I'm in your bed?     
 Not really, no.     
 I am too tired for games and I have to find six million euros tomorrow.     
 You will never find six million in a day.     
 Not even if you sold both of your kidneys.     
 Technically, you don't even own them anymore.     
 The Twelve do.     
 They own every little bit of you.     
 Goodnight, Villanelle.     
 What kind of baby do you think I was?     
 [CHUCKLES] I think I was cute.     
 Hmm.     
 Do you think people smiled with joy when they saw my little face?     
 God, you're boring.     
 You're more boring than that accountant I just shot.     
 And accountants... are really boring.     
 [SHOUTS] Hey! Hey! Huh?!     
 Wakey-wakey, Konstantin!     
 I think you were ugly as hell, okay?     
 Right.     
 Well, now you're just looking for a reaction.     
 No, I'm not.     
 I've seen a photo of you.     
 Very strange head. Bulbous. Unnatural.     
 Who was I with?     
 I don't remember.     
 Hmm.     
 I want to find my family.     
 Why?     
 So you can feel like dirt the whole time about how you're letting them down?     
 [SCOFFS]     
 Smell me.     
 No.     
 Smell me, hmm? What do I smell of?     
 What am I wearing?     
 - I don't know. 
- Ah.     
 Power.     
 I'm wearing power, and to keep power, you need knowledge.     
 - [SIGHS] 
- You'll find them for me.     
 Okay?     
 I sleep on the couch.
