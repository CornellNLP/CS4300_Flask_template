 EVE: We know you're on the payroll, so you might as well start talking.   
 Frank said the organization calls themselves The Twelve.   
 One of the girls was called Oksana.   
 KENNY: Oksana Astonkova. 
Fits the profile perfectly.   
 I know you're a psychopath.   
 She was in my house. She took my phone.   
 And she'll have the location of the safe house.   
 They found a male body on the site near where you picked up Frank.    
 EVE: There are three of them. 
Someone is unaccounted for.    
 - Where is Nadia? 
- Nadia is still alive.    
 Russia. You have to go there.

 Don't fiddle with that.    
 You're in because you stole some hats.    
 Wow!    
 I am dangerous.    
 They were controversial hats.    
 When you're inside, you have to find a way to see the doctor.    
 Okay?    
 That's important.

 Why have you never tried to have s*x with me?

 This is a very important job for you.    
 It is... to protect you.    
 - I know you're nervous. 
- I'm not nervous.    
 I know you're nervous. 
But you don't have to be.    
 You go in, you find the doctor, kill Nadia, and come out.    
 And what if someone recognizes me?    
 They won't.    
 It's been years since you were here.    
 You will collect me afterwards?    
 I swear in my heart.    
 Just a few days... and I pick you up.    
 I don't need a few days.    
 I will see you tomorrow.

 I want to see the doctor.    
 Could it be Oksana?    
 KENNY: No, we don't know where Oksana, um, Villanelle, is.    
 Her name is Nadia Kadomtseva.    
 Russian intelligence picked her up near Bletcham and took her out of the country.    
 Wait, hold on. Are we calling Villanelle Oksana now?    
 It's her real name.    
 So Nadia was the other assassin with Villanelle?    
 She's been taken to a prison outside Moscow.    
 The same one Villanelle was in three years ago.    
 What? Can we... Is there any chance we can speak to her?    
 She might know how to get to Villanelle.    
 If this girl is a lead to anything, it's The Twelve.    
 Can we go?    
 Well, there are some delicate strings I could pull.    
 Perhaps they're worth a tug.    
 All of us?    
 - I think... 
- I'll let...    
 - I'll let you guys go on. 
- ...I better stay here in case you need anything from the base.    
 Better not get in the way after last time.

- No, thanks.    
 Just you and me, then.    
 To Moscow.     
 Yo!     
 Okay.

 I don't want to stand between you and what you want to do with your life but it is actually my job to stand in the way of something that puts it in danger. 
- No, we're making progress.     
 Oh, good. Mm.     
 How many more people have to die before you complete this level?     
 - Wow! 
- Yeah. Wow.     
 Why are you so angry?     
 I'm not angry, I'm scared!     
 I don't want to wake up to your face on one of those!     
 Damn it, I don't want to shout at you.     
 - No, I think you should. 
- What?     
 - Shout at me. Come on. 
- Why, to make you feel better?     
 No, do it to make  you  feel better!     
 It doesn't make me feel better!     
 You alive, at home, without scary ladies breaking into our house makes me feel better!

 I have to find her. 
She wants me to find her.

- Oh.     
 Well, now she's rather friendly with us.     
 She told us that she was helping Frank Haleton with safe passage here to you. 
Why did you want to talk to him?     
 He was relevant for a special investigation we had here.     
 We were sad we didn't get to speak to him.     
 Well, we did get to speak to him.     
 He gave us some information about an organization we believe is behind a number of assassinations.     
 Including your Victor Kedrin.     
 Is your investigation looking into that, too?     
 I thought so.     
 Right. Well, I believe rather extraordinarily that we're on the same side here.     
 Isn't that nice?     
 Do you have a name for this organization?
