- You choose your family over me?   
 KONSTANTIN: That's what families are. It's what they do.   
 I wouldn't know. Mine are all dead.   
 Most of them, sure.   
 VILLANELLE: What do you mean, "Most of them"?   
 What kind of baby do you think I was?    
 I've seen a photo of you.    
 You had a strange head. Unnatural.    
 I got what you ask for. Your family.

 The orphanage phone me and say... you burn place down.     
 It was one floor.     
 Two at most.     
 - And many people die.

 And you die with them. 
This is what they tell us.

 You were beautiful baby.     
 Everyone would stop me in street and say, "She's beautiful baby."     
 Head was big, but beautiful.     
 MOTHER: Oh, yeah.     
 I used to like dressing up and you always wanted my clothes, so I would make costume from old curtains for you.     
 Here.     
 I look ridiculous.     
 Oh. That's me.

 I didn't mind that you never came back for me.     
 What I mind...     
 ... is that you won't admit what you are.     
 That I am my mother's daughter.     
 Get out of my house.     
 [SIGHS]     
 I...     
 I j...     
 [SIGHS] I think I need to kill you... Mama.
