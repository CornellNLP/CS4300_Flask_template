 Frankie : Ah, summer vacation... Weekends at the lake, driving cross-country in a Winnebago, Disneyland. Yeah, well, all that costs money. This is how our summer went. 
 (Sighs) I'm bored. 
 (Fireworks exploding) I'm bored. 
 (All) We're bored. 
 Kids, it's summer. 
 Get up off the couch and go outside and play. 
 (Arrow whizzes) 
 Yeah. Nice. 
 Okay. Everybody get inside and watch TV. 
 But finally you hit the most glorious day of summer... The last one, when the kids go back to school and you finally get some order back in your life. 
 We cannot be late for the first day of school! 
 Let's go! Let's go! Where is Axl? 
 Brick, go get your brother up. Axl! Get up! 
 Did you brush your teeth? 
 Sorry. I guess I'm out of the habit from summer. 
 Here. Rinse and spit. 
 Where are my school supplies? 
 Mike, where are the school supplies? 
 I don't know. 
 You said you were gonna steal some from work. 
 I've taken too much! Ehlert is on to me. 
 This is just not a good way to start my first year on cross-country. We got a bowling pencil... And a paper clip. 
 That's all you need for the first day. Oh, Brick! You left a sandwich in here from last year. 
 That's disgusting! 
 And you got an "A" on your "I love winter" paper. 
 Good job! Ohh. God, when did I even make egg salad? 
 Oh! It's not egg salad. Ew, ew, ew. 
 Mom, you have to sign these forms. 
 What forms? 
 You were supposed to sign them and give me a check today, or I won't get my cross-country sweatshirt. 
 If I don't have my cross-country sweatshirt, no one will know I'm on cross-country. 
 You really want people to know you're on a loser sport like cross-country? (Sneezes) It sucks. 
 Oh, shut up, Axl! 
 Dad, did you just hear what Axl sneezed about cross-country? We don't say "shut up." 
 Mom said "shut up" yesterday. 
 We don't tattle either. 
 (Horn honks) Good enough. There's the bus. Strap it on and go. 
 It's still wet. There's school today? When was I supposed to find out about this? 
 Nice parenting, mom. 
 Okay, that's it. Everybody on the bus. Here we go. 
 Frankie : Hurry up! Everybody out! Let's go, let's go. Here we go. Here we go. Come on, come on, come on, come on. 
 Have a great day. We'll miss you. Stay late if you have to. 
 (Both sigh) 
 We missed the bus. 
 (Sighs) How many days until summer? 
 Well, the school year was off to an awesome start. 
 The kids were late for class, and I was late for work. 
 Luckily, I had Bob to cover for me. Bob! Where the hell is Frances? I don't know. (Voice breaks) I don't know. (Normal voice) Oh, Frankie! Sorry. I let you down. Punish me, Mr. Ehlert. Whatever you're gonna do to her, do to me. Unless you were making her work the weekend of the persimmon festival. I'm Manning a booth. You've never manned anything. I'm so sorry, Mr. Ehlert. It's just, today is the kids' first day of school, and we're not exactly back to our routine yet, and... Pete, what are your kids doing right now? Pete : I have no idea, sir. You see? Now that's a salesman. (Sighs) We should be ashamed of ourselves, Mike. Ashamed. You know, every year we say we're gonna get better, and we never are. There's no reason that we can't be those other people. What other people? The good people. The ones who aren't late for work. The ones who don't send their son to school with a nail scissors and a lip pencil and call it "school supplies." No. You know what? It's a new day. We're making a change. Starting now, we are gettin' out in front of it. You get in front of it. I'll get under it. Night, honey. I am sensing that you're not nearly as ashamed as you should be. Mnh-mnh. No. I'm serious. If this was "Supernanny" and we saw this morning on hidden home camera, Jo would crucify us. I swear to God, I will pull that cable out of the wall. Okay. Fine. You stay the same, and I will grow into a better person alone. You sleep. I will fill out three children's worth of school forms by myself. (Groans) Fine. You want help filling out the forms, I will help you fill out the forms. Thank you. Mm-hmm. (Sighs) What's the pediatrician's name again? Doctor... Larimer. Larimer. Sure. And Sue's middle name would be... You know her middle name. Sue. Remember? Oh. They wrote it down twice on her birth certificate by accident, and we keep saying we're gonna go down there and change it... (Scoffs) And we never do. (Sighs) They want three "in case of emergency" people? Yep. Seems excessive. We'll give 'em one. (Sighs) This was your plan all along, wasn't it? Maybe. Night, honey. (Sighs) Mm. Okay. You just get your sleep, 'cause tomorrow's a new leaf, baby. New leaf. (Sighs) Sue Sue heck. Yeah, we really probably should've made the time to change that. I smell cooking. Is grandma here? No, grandma's not here. I'm making us a good breakfast so we can start our day off right. Yep. We're gettin' out in front of it. That's what we're doing, honey, right? Yeah. I smell bacon. Grandma? Other people can cook food besides grandma, you know. (Beeping) Aah! There's a weird noise coming out of my clock! Make it stop! Axl, relax. I set your alarm last night, so you would have time to get up and get ready for school without being rushed. Grandma? Grandma is not here. I'm here. (Turns off alarm) Now I want you all to sit down and listen up. We're getting up on time. We're having a healthy breakfast. We'll start the day organized and armed for success. Don't do it. Clearly these are not our parents. If you can make that case, I'm on board. Sit. So... in order not to have a repeat of yesterday, I have borrowed this chart from work. Now for the purposes of this exercise, Brick, you'll be Mr. Ehlert. Axl, you be Pete. Sue Lou, I'm me, and, Mike, you can be Bob. Do I have to Be bob? Yes. Okay. Lou, today you have cross-country practice, so I have for you your signed forms and a check for your new cross-country sweatshirt. Pete, you have the food drive. Here's your canned corn. Please put it in the bin and don't use it for fake vomit. Now, most exciting of all, Brick... I mean, Mr. Ehlert... I have for you a brand-new backpack. But I don't want a new backpack. I love my old backpack. I know that you loved your old backpack, but that thing practically walked to the garbage itself. But it was my friend! Who am I supposed to eat lunch with? I don't know. A person? Okay, so my family was a little slow to make change. I was getting ahead of it. I was baking brownies, and by the end of the day I was already seeing results. Whoo-hoo! (Laughs) Thank you. Thank you so much. Oh! (Laughs) You look great! And so athletic! And I'm the only one who has one, because my awesome mom sent in a check. Other moms just don't get it. I feel sorry for their kids. (Groans) Well, thank you for the worst day ever. Now that you've screwed up my body clock, I had to drag myself through gym, and then I dozed off and sleep-farted in science. Ooh, brownies. Those aren't for now. Those are for all the bake sales I'm gonna be hit up for this year. When are you gonna give up on this sicko experiment of yours? This isn't like the juicer! We're following through! Well, the new backpack and I are not getting along... At all. What happened? Why was your backpack even on your head? I was seeing if it had the same echo as my old one. It doesn't. (Sighs) We have to go talk to Brick's teacher. (TV playing indistinctly) Oh, no. When did we get the call? We didn't yet, but he was already weird today, and it's just a matter of time, so I say, let's get ahead of it and call the meeting before the teacher calls us. Why? Why do we gotta go lookin' for trouble? I'm pretty sure it knows our address. Listen, I know what I'm doing here, Mike. I got a freezer full of brownies, and Sue called me "awesome." There's brownies? (Sighs) Trust me. If we make the call, then we're in control, and we're the ones callin' the shots. (Bell rings) And that's why we thought we could offer some insights into our son that might make the year go more smoothly. So you're here on the third day of school to try to get your child some special attention. Well, no, not special attention. But, you see, he is... (Sighs) You know, a little special. Let me tell you something, mommy. Every parent thinks their child is special. They can't all be. That's impossible. I mean, some children are just average. We know. That's our other two kids. Yeah, but, see, Brick is quirky-special. Special needs? No, not that special. Well, then he's normal. So what are you doing here, dear... On my lunch hour? (Chuckles) Well, uh, we were just trying to get out on top of it, and, um, you see, Brick whispers. (Chuckles) 
 
 There is such a thing as over-parenting, mommy. (Chuckles) That's not us. No. If anything, we under-parent. (Laughs) We phone it in. Right, daddy? (Chuckle I don't know what we're doing here. Are we trying to convince her that Brick is weird or not weird or what? I know that it's easy for some mothers to latch on to their sons too tightly. Maybe you're trying to get from him what is missing in your relationship with your husband. Hey. Let me tell you something. You add an "s" to "mother," you know what you get? "Smother." And no child benefits by being raised by a smother. I am not! I'm not a smother. I'm a lazy parent with a weird kid. Go on. Tell her, Mike. Just tell her how pathetic we are. All right. Okay. I'm pullin' the rip cord on this thing. Grab your purse. Let's go. (Sighs) Okay, so the meeting with Brick's teacher was a little rough, but it wasn't about me. It was about helping Brick. Brick? Brick Heck, right? Uh-huh. I'm moving you up close where I can keep an eye on you. They want you to have special attention. I'll give you special attention. Hey. You're already up. Right. Up since 5:00. Hope you're happy. I'm a morning person now! It was one day, Axl. I got you up on time one day. Well, it's very dangerous to play around with a teenager's sleep cycle. Probably messed up my development. I probably won't be able to have babies now or something, uh... That might not be such a bad thing. Good morning. Oh, my God. You're wearing that again? It's supposed to be 80 degrees all week. How do I know that? 'Cause there's nothing else on at 5:00 A.M. Except the Hoosier farm report. For your information, Axl, I have the fall athletic pep rally tomorrow, which I'm a part of... (Chuckles) And am promoting today. Speaking of which, I made buttons for all of you. Wow! "Proud parent of a cross-country star." That's a lot of glitter. I'll put mine on in the car. (Laughter) Hey, where's Brick? (Sighs) Great. I finally get one kid up, and now the other one's sleeping in. Sue : And one for you. Sue, go get your brother up. Brick, get up! (Sighs) What are you, your brother now? Why aren't you ready for school? Brick : I'm taking a personal day. (Whispers) Personal day. Come on. You love school. Get up. (Normal voice) Please don't make me go. I don't like my new teacher. Why not? Everything was going great, but then all of a sudden, she drags my desk to the front of the class. I like sitting in the back. I read my book, and I sip my juice box. I'm back by the sharpener. It's all good. Maybe Mrs. Rinsky's taken a special interest in you. Doesn't that make you feel well-cared-for and understood and, you know... (Sighs) Loved? No. I feel like she's watching me all the time, and she won't let me whisper to myself. (Whispers) Whisper to myself. (Normal voice) I hate school. (Chuckles) I swear, this is so not me. I mean, for you to see me at school twice in one week... I'm usually here twice the whole year, if that. (Laughs) Look, I got the gals waiting for me at beefsteak Charlie's, so why don't we just cut to the chase? If you could please just forget everything I said at our last meeting... Done. And go back to treating him the way you would've treated him had I not come in, and maybe move his desk back? I know that would make Brick so happy. So now the kid's calling the shots? No. I'm completely calling the shots. And you... well, you're the main shot-caller. Let me tell you somethin'. You take the "m" off of "mom" and you replace it with "g-l," you know what you got? I'll tell you what you got. Glom. Want me to conjugate it for you? To glom. She gloms. She's a glommy mommy. I am not a glommy mommy! It's just that Brick has never not wanted to go to school before, and I will not let you step one foot out of this room until you promise to pay no attention to anything I've said! Fine. But... I don't want to see you anymore. You don't volunteer for the field trip. You don't show up for the science fair. The annual mother's day pancake breakfast... Maybe you're not so hungry that day. Got it? Damn. I really liked that pancake breakfast. (Sizzling) (Sniffles) Hey. Oh, do you know where the corncob holders are? (Sighs) What the hell are you doing? It's 2:00 in the morning. Yeah, well, tell that to my stomach, 'cause all it knows is it's awake and it's hungry. You guys are all like, "Wake up early - we'll be better people." And my alarm is all, "Aah! Aah! Aah!" And mom is all, "Mnh! Mnh! Mnh!" Why do we have to listen to what she says anyway? You know, why don't you just man up and say no? (Chuckles) You know nothing about being a man. (Sighs) Being a man is being smart. I know that in May I want to go to the lndy 500. It is expensive. She won't want me to go. But she will remember that I supported her plan, and if she does not, I will remind her. I will be going to the lndy 500 with no push-back. And that, my son, is being a man. Hmm? Mr. Rasmussen? Is it a problem that I have to leave sixth period early 'cause I'm a part of the fall athletic pep rally? Since this is first period, no. Okay. Just checking. Do you want to take off your sweatshirt? You look a little flushed. Oh, my cross-country sweatshirt? No. (Chuckles) I'm fine. I need to wear it to the fall athletic pep rally, which I'm a part of. Okay. So on page 24... Mr. Rasmussen, do you need me to give you my cross-country schedule, so you can schedule tests around my cross-country meets? No. Oh. Okay. Whew. Hey, Brick. How was school? Okay. Did Ms. Rinsky happen to move your desk back? Are you worried about me? Well, I'm a mom. All moms worry about their kids. Ms. Rinsky said, my "mommy" came to see her, and you were worried about me. Okay. We had a deal. She was not supposed to say anything to you. Oh, my gosh. If you're worried, maybe I should be worried. No! Brick... Should I be worried? Is there something wrong with me? Ow. Ow. Ow. I guess this year just seems harder than usual. You know, the new backpack and everything. My old backpack always had my back. It's hard to go through it all alone. Aah! I ruined Brick! I took my happiest kid and made him miserable. I had to get that backpack back. Ugh! Axl! Where's the trash? I need Brick's old backpack. I took all the bags out to the curb. What? You never take out the trash. Why would you start now? Well, 'cause dad told me to be smart and do what you say, and I'm Bob, and Bob's supposed to take out the trash, so that's what I did. You're not Bob, Axl. You're Pete. So I'm three different people, and none of them make you happy! (Engine rumbles, brakes squeal) Oh, no. Frankie : Wait! Wait! Hold on, please! You gotta stop! My son's best friend is in there! Wait! Wait! Wait! (Brakes squeal) Just give me a minute! I'll... I'll find it. I'll find it! Oh, my God. There's a lot of shampoo left in this. (Trash rustling) (Brakes squeal) (Gasps) Victory! Oh! Mwah! Yes! (Pants) Ta-da! Nah. I think I'll keep the new one. Thanks, though. You just said that you missed it. You said it was throwing you off. I can't tell if it's you or the backpack, but something smells pretty rank. Besides, the other kids in my class seem to like  this Sha-qwille O'Neal character. Maybe it'll help me fit in more. (Whispers) Sha-qwille O'Neal character. All my getting ahead of it for nothing? Well, at least I knew for sure I helped Sue. (Man, voice amplified) And now your 2010 cross-country team! Let's hear it! Yep, Sue was happy 'cause I'd gotten on top of it. She'd worn her new cross-country sweatshirt all week long. (Girls scream) Girl : Ah! Boy : Oh, man! (Girl laughs) Boy : Are they okay? Boy : I don't know. (Exhales deeply) (Indistinct conversations) I thought we could do it, Mike. I really thought we could get ahead of it, but everything just got screwed up. Yeah. I never thought we could do it. You didn't? No. It's not possible. (Ripping tape) (Sighs) You can't get ahead of it. You try to plug one leak and another one just pops up. So what are you saying, I should just quit trying? Yes. Please. That's exactly what I'm saying. Mike. Look, you gave it a shot. You had an idea. And you'll want to remember, I was completely supportive. The thing is, Frankie, (ripping tape) There are people that have it all together and everything works out, but we're not those people. We don't have an in-ground pool life. We have an above-ground life. But it seems kinda lazy to just give up. Don't think of it as giving up. Think of it as getting ahead of the quitting. Everybody gives up by Christmas anyway. Think of how far ahead we'll be of all those idiots who are still trying. The truth is, once I gave up, it was a huge weight off my shoulders. Life got back to normal. Oh, my God! (Horn honking) I've overslept! Is anybody up? Nobody, and the bus driver's honking. Brick, go get everybody up. Never mind. I'll do it. Everybody get up! Dude, no one set my alarm! I was supposed to write a paper this morning! Mike, run out to the bus and tell 'em to wait! (Mike grunts) Mom, look, I printed out the front page of the school web site. Look at it! "Overheated student ruins pep rally." Oh, honey. I know! I'm in the paper! (Laughs) I'm "overheated student." Everybody's gonna know me now. Mom, Ms. Rinsky needs parents to supervise the field trip. Can't. Banned. Go! Wait. You never packed us lunch. Shoot. Ohh! Let 'em sit out in the sun before you try! Awesome. (Sighs) (Door closes) You know those other people, the ones we're always trying to be like... I think maybe if they looked in our windows and saw how good we have it, they might actually envy us.
