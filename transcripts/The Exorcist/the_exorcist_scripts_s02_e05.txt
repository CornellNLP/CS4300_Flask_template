 You're facing your fears with The Exorcist. 
 -Unclean spirit! -In the name of God! 
 Catch all-new episodes Fridays. 
 And check out our other Fox programs-- 
 The Gifted, Lucifer, and Gotham. 
 I can make a difference, Alfred. I know I can. 
 Only on Fox. 
 -Previously on The Exorcist... -(demonic voice): She is going 
 -to find you, you know. -What about this group in Chicago? 
 If we could get our hands on a demon with that level of influence and power... 
 Hey, maybe God knows where Caleb went. 
 It doesn't work like that. 
 What good is a god that never shows up? 
 -Is that guy a priest? -SHELBY: I heard they both are. 
 -Why are you guys here? -TOMAS: I think there's something wrong. 
 I feel it. 
 -Aah! -(screams) 
 MARCUS: There is work to do here. 
 You sail? There's this bird's nest on Jarrell Cove. 
 -Strictly off-limits. -Maybe some other time. 
 -Do you think God led us here? -He's not talking to me. 
 -Well, maybe you're not listening. -(short chuckle) 
 GRACE: We can be together forever. 
 (Andy laughing) 
 I'm really proud of you. 
 Is somebody in here? 
 * 
 ANDY: Grace, honey. 
 I thought maybe we could take a book outside. 
 What do you think? Huh? 
 What's wrong? 
 -Verity? -Who are you talking to? 
 What-what are you doing up here? 
 You go first. 
 Who's Grace? 
 What? 
 What do you... 
 Are you okay? 
 Yeah. 
 -Because this is... seriously gross. -(fly buzzes) 
 Is this, like, a Nikki thing? 
 What do you think? 
 I didn't mean to... 
 Didn't mean what? 
 I'm not allowed to grieve for my wife? 
 I'm not allowed to have one place in this house that belongs to me? 
 -Andy, I'm not... -You're not what? 
 You're not supposed to be here. 
 (fly buzzing) 
 (panting) 
 -(fly buzzes) -Aah! 
 (groans) 
 What is happening? 
 No. 
 No. 
 No. 
 No. 
 Where are you going, Daddy? 
 You're not real. 
 You're not real. 
 * 
 You going somewhere? 
 Oh, hey. 
 I actually thought it would be really fun if we all took an overnight camping trip together, as a... as a family. 
 -Camping? -Yeah. 
 -Really? -Truck and Caleb-- they have... they got all this gear last Christmas, and they've-they've been begging me ever since, so... 
 And-and tonight just seemed to be the right time to do it? 
 Yeah, I know it's sudden. Um... 
 It's really sudden, but... 
 The truth is... 
 I asked Nicole to marry me... uh, 14 years ago... today. 
 And, uh... 
 You know you said this place is practically a shrine to her, so... 
 Okay. 
 Uh, I get it. 
 I do. 
 But Harper-- she's barely had a chance to settle. 
 And I don't want to disrupt that. 
 I actually think it would be really good for her to get out of the house for a night. 
 Good for all of us. 
 You've got to be kidding me. 
 Hi. Uh, I don't think we've met. 
 My name is Father Tomas Ortega. 
 I was hoping to speak with Rose. 
 Rose! 
 Creepy annoying priest is back. 
 Don't be rude. 
 Father Tomas. 
 This is a surprise. 
 Is there somewhere we can talk more privately? 
 This may be a little bit hard for you to hear. 
 Especially after how we met. 
 You know that Marcus and I are... 
 Exorcists. 
 Our job-- our calling-- is to protect people, families, from the terrible evil that preys on this world. 
 Well, in my experience, people don't need the Devil's help to be horrible to each other. 
 What exactly are you getting at? 
 (ghostly, whispering voices) 
 (voices stop) 
 Have-have you noticed anything unusual? 
 Anyone behaving out of character? 
 (car door closes) 
 It's, uh... it's hard for me to say. 
 I've only spent a few days here. 
 Maybe if I could speak to some of the kids? 
 I respect what you do, Father. 
 They're strong, but they are susceptible. 
 -Yes, I-I understand... -Particularly Harper. 
 We just got done convincing her that demons don't exist. 
 I can't let you put her through that again. 
 -This is completely different. -I really appreciate everything you've done for her. 
 I'm sorry. I... 
 I really think you should go now. 
 Let me guess-- thought about it and nothing sounded better than seeing that nest? 
 Uh, you seem to know these islands pretty well. 
 Anything unusual spring to mind-- um, historical oddities, violent crime? 
 Bar fight violent, or, uh, Glenn Powell violent? 
 Who's Glenn Powell? 
 Back in the '50s, lived on, uh, north side of Nachburn. 
 A normal guy, good job. 
 Then one day, for no reason at all, kills his wife and kids. 
 Except for his oldest daughter-- she was at a slumber party on the mainland. 
 So, Glenn picks up a length of chain, takes the ferry across the way, goes looking for his daughter. 
 Kills everyone at the party. 
 But the daughter crawled into a cabinet and hid there while he tore the house apart. 
 Till the cops showed up, shot ol' Glenn dead. 
 Did she say why he did it? 
 You can ask her. 
 She lives across the bay. 
 Hop on. 
 Daddy, are you mad at me? 
 No. 
 Then why won't you look at me? 
 Because I'm scared you're not real. 
 You're a silly Billy. 
 I'm standing right here. 
 I've always been here. 
 Stop. 
 Please. 
 You should be careful, Daddy. 
 (Andy groans) 
 (groans) 
 MARCUS: If this is too difficult... 
 ALICE: Oh, I've spent my whole life talking about that day. 
 60 years, three kids of my own, and I still remember it like it was yesterday. 
 Tell me about your dad. 
 Oh, he was the best. 
 Every night he'd come home to tuck us in and he'd tell each one of us girls something that-that he loved about us. 
 And he didn't drink or-or cuss none. 
 He was kind. 
 In every way. 
 Why do you think he did it? 
 I know my Daddy. 
 That-that... that wasn't him. 
 It was something... that looked like him. 
 I believe you. 
 One of the few that actually does. 
 I lost a lot of my friends, because I wouldn't change my story. 
 That's something I understand. 
 What have you lost, Mr. Keane? 
 (laughs): Clearly, I lost my next question. 
 Um... did your dad say anything? 
 (whispers): That's how I knew it wasn't him. 
 The voice was all wrong. 
 It was... dark and scratchy, like... like nails on a chalkboard. 
 And he kept speaking in a language I never heard before. 
 Did he know any other languages? 
 He barely finished eighth grade. 
 That wasn't him talking, it was... that thing inside of him. 
 Wearing him like some cheap suit. 
 Kids, come on! Let's go! 
 This is stupid. Why are we doing this? 
 Because we've all been under a lot of stress, and it'll be nice to do something fun together, as a family. 
 Like get Lyme disease? 
 Exactly. 
 Hey. Did someone say s'mores? 
 S'mores! 
 (chuckles): All right, there you go. 
 -Here you go, pal. -Thanks. 
 Shelby. 
 There's my fearless explorer. 
 Um, Caleb said that there's... bears on the island. 
 Starving bears. 
 (chuckles): There's no bears. 
 Well, not unless they figured out how boats work. 
 (laughs) See? I told you. 
 You do know bears swim, right? 
 Oh, I know that. There's a lot of bears on this island. 
 -(laughs) -Wait. Uh... 
 No. 
 No. 
 -Glenn Powell lived on this island? -MARCUS: Yeah. 
 And the story's got all the hallmarks of possession. 
 Could the demon still be here 50 years later? 
 I don't know. Not in my experience. 
 (sighs) I should go back and try again with the Kim family. 
 And tell them what? That 50 years ago a demon killed a family on the island? 
 Look, your visions brought us here. 
 I believe you. 
 But we need confirmation. 
 We'll go together, in the daylight, tomorrow. 
 What if they're in danger? What if we can help them? 
 If we go pounding on their door in the middle of the night with some crazy-ass story, we're gonna scare them off for good. 
 Are we clear? 
 * 
 Clear. 
 (reciting in Latin) 
 -Amen. -Amen. 
 We don't want to miss the plane. 
 (continues in Latin) 
 Bennett, if we don't leave now, your friends in the Church will find us. 
 (continues in Latin) 
 Our only chance is to take the fight to them. 
 Amen. And what about Dolores? 
 You're praying over a dead woman. 
 She's already integrated. 
 Father Tomas brought a woman back from the brink of integration. 
 A woman who had been possessed before, who'd already gone through Hell and come out the other side. 
 Perhaps... she was stronger because she learned how to fight. 
 We can't take Dolores with us. 
 So would you rather set her loose on the streets, or leave her to starve like a chained dog? 
 (growls) 
 I need to know that when the time comes, you're capable of doing what needs to be done. 
 Devin... please... 
 -Dolores. -It's me. 
 I'm still in here, fighting. 
 Prove it. 
 It's not Dolores. 
 You told me if ever I need help, you would come for me. 
 And, Devin, I need you. 
 If I stay, put everything I have, everything I am into saving you, the innocent will suffer, countless people will die. 
 But what about me? 
 Thank you. 
 The real Dolores would never put herself before the lives of others. 
 (screeching) 
 (grunts) 
 You were the best of us. 
 You don't deserve this. 
 Devs peccata dimmitt. 
 Non ego. 
 (screeching) 
 (roaring) 
 It's time to pay a visit to this Chicago monster of yours. 
 (birds hooting, insects chittering) 
 (bird hooting) 
 Son of a bitch. 
 (Harper snickers) 
 (sniffs) Mine's perfect. 
 (mocking): Mine's perfect. 
 How do you know when it's done? 
 It's all about the smell. 
 You got to get the consummate level... of toast. 
 Make one for me. 
 Five dollars. 
 So, how many of those have you eaten? 
 Only two. 
 (quietly): But Truck's had, like, 17. 
 (gasps softly) 
 (whispers): Darn it. He beat me by three. 
 (Harper chuckles) 
 * 
 Am I gonna get to stay? 
 Well, right now it's just a temporary assignment until we could figure out the best place for you. 
 Would you want to stay? 
 Yeah. I like it here. 
 Yeah? 
 Me, too. 
 (crickets chirping) 
 GRACE: Come home, Daddy. 
 (panting quietly) 
 Let me go. 
 (footsteps crunching) 
 The house is scary. 
 You need to come home. 
 I'll be good, I promise. 
 Stop it. 
 Stop it. I know what you are. 
 You're a s-stress-related delusion. 
 You're-you're a mental break. You leave me alone. 
 Go. Go! Go! 
 I... want you... to come home. 
 ROSE: Andy. 
 Andy, this is looking great. 
 You have to see Harper, by the way. 
 She is loving this. 
 Andy. 
 -Are you okay? -(sighs) 
 There's something wrong with me, Rose. 
 What? 
 Ever since Nikki died, I... 
 I haven't been a hundred percent. 
 Andy... 
 (sighs): I tried... 
 I tried so hard to pretend everything was... okay, because the kids needed it. 
 I needed it. 
 But I'm not okay. 
 Come here. 
 (Andy sighs) 
 Listen to me. 
 What you went through, what you're still going through, you're allowed to grieve, you're supposed to grieve. 
 (whispers): No. 
 I think I'm losing my mind. 
 You don't have to be perfect. 
 You can just be here... with us. 
 Come here. 
 You know you can tell me anything, right? 
 (softly): Come here. 
 Rose... 
 I think I'm seeing... (groans) 
 What? 
 It's a... bugbite. 
 -Hey, you should go check up on the kids, yeah? -Yeah. 
 -I'll be there in a minute. Let me just finish up. -Yeah, but... I meant what I said. 
 Thank you. 
 ROSE (softly): Okay. Okay. 
 -* -(voices muted) 
 (ghostly, whispering voices) 
 (exhales) 
 Hello? 
 (quietly): Anybody home? 
 -(creaking) -Hello? 
 Rose? 
 (ghostly, whispering voices) 
 (Tomas exhales) 
 (roaring) 
 (bird calling in distance) 
 (engine turns off) 
 What are you doing? 
 Well... you're the, uh, ex-priest who's looking for something he's lost, right? 
 You strike me as the sort of person who's not exactly... comfortable sitting quietly with his own thoughts. 
 And? 
 And... 
 I was the same way. 
 I did two tours in Kosovo, came back. 
 (chuckles) 
 Felt like my brain was on fire, like I wanted to rip off my skin. 
 -Like you'll never be still. -Yeah. 
 Yeah. 
 (sniffs) 
 There was a kid in the rubble. 
 We were, uh... clearing out this neighborhood in Uro.evac. 
 It was all bombed to hell. 
 I was scrambling up this embankment. 
 I put my hand down on something soft, and I look down. 
 I saw that kid every day for the next two years. 
 In the morning, I'd wake up, he'd be... looking down on me. 
 What about you, Marcus? 
 What do you see? 
 You want to know what's in my head? 
 Arguing. 
 Mum and Dad barking at each other like dogs, both of them drunk. 
 He's swinging a hammer, she's in a ball on the floor, trying to scoop her brains back in with both her hands. 
 I'm yelling at him to stop, but he cracks her again. 
 And now, now there's blood coming out of her mouth like a fountain. 
 I'm seven years old. 
 I pull his poaching rifle off the back of the door, and I shoot a bullet right in the middle of his throat, and even as he's going down, his big, bloody hands are trying to squeeze the life out of me. 
 That's for starters. 
 I see this little, unwanted boy stuck halfway up an oak tree. 
 All the other orphan bastards are trying to knock him down with bricks and bottles to send him back to the infirmary so he can spend another night cutting patterns into his arms to send himself to sleep. 
 I see this little boy in... 
 Mexico City. 
 His neck is twisted all the way around, and his mom is screaming at me from the doorway. 
 I see a housewife in Seattle mixing bleach with tap water and telling her little girl that the water is holy so it burns her when it hits her skin. 
 That is what I see when I close my eyes! 
 (inhales, exhales deeply) 
 (sniffles) 
 * 
 (ghostly, whispering voices) 
 (door creaks) 
 (ghostly, whispering voices) 
 (Morty chirping) 
 (chirping continues) 
 (distorted warbling) 
 (praying in Spanish) 
 And that is why every Halloween, the Island Witch crawls out of her well 
 -and searches for more children to steal. -(twig snaps) 
 Seriously, what is your deal? 
 -HARPER: Why is she in a well? -CALEB: She lives there. 
 HARPER: You said she puts bodies in there. 
 Have you noticed anything weird happening around the house? 
 
 
 
 Weird like what? 
 Like, supernatural weird. 
 (chuckles) "Supernatural"? 
 Dude, you have got to stop hanging around those dumbass priests. 
 Right, right, because religion sucks and everyone's an idiot. 
 You know, V, some people actually just want to help other people. 
 Like the counselors at my camp? 
 They couldn't wait to help me pray the gay away. 
 That's why they strapped me to a bed. 
 Sprayed me with freezing water. 
 Told me I was an abomination in the eyes of your awesome God. 
 -To help. -Hey. 
 I'm sorry for what they did to you. 
 -But they were misguided. -(chuckles) 
 I'm so glad I tried to take my life three times because they were so misguided. 
 Hey, no, not misguided. 
 Evil. 
 But they didn't work for God. 
 They work for the other guy. 
 Like there's even a difference. 
 -Like you even have the slightest... -No. 
 I know more than... I know more than you think. 
 Oh, what, 'cause you read a sad Bible story? 
 I was 2.4 pounds when I was born. 
 Methadone all in my system. 
 It was my first birthday present from my mom. 
 And right now, every one... every one of my brothers and sisters is dead. 
 Except me. 
 'Cause I found something to hold onto. 
 I mean, we all got parents that mess us up. 
 But God isn't one of them. 
 He knows you're perfect because that's the way He made you. 
 God, I hate camping. 
 (chuckles) 
 Yeah, me, too. 
 Hey. 
 What'd I miss? 
 Island Witch. 
 Oh, God, Caleb. 
 Really? 
 Where's Truck? 
 Um, I think he went to pee. 
 He's been gone for a while. 
 I'll go check on him. 
 (loud thud) 
 (creaking) 
 -(loud thud) -(grunts) 
 -(loud thud) -(door creaks) 
 (panting) 
 Father nuestro, que estás en el cielo. 
 Santificado sea tu nombre. 
 Venga nosotros tu reino. 
 Hágase tu voluntad. En la tierra como en el cielo. 
 (continues praying in Spanish) 
 VERITY: Truck? 
 Truck? 
 (rattling) 
 (loud thumping) 
 (thumping continues) 
 Truck. 
 Truck. Hey, big guy. 
 (door creaks) 
 (loud, echoing thump) 
 You got to stop doing that. Please. 
 Please stop doing that. 
 (thumping continues) 
 Truck? Hey. 
 Truck? 
 Truck! 
 Truck! 
 (Verity gasps) 
 (choking) 
 (Verity grunts) 
 -(Verity screams) -Verity! 
 In the name of God the Father Everlasting and all of His saints, I order you to show yourself and make your presence known! 
 Verity! 
 Verity! 
 (praying in Spanish) 
 He commands you. 
 (continues in Spanish) 
 He commands you! 
 Verity! 
 -(Verity gasping, grunting) -Truck? 
 No. No. 
 -Truck! -(grunts) 
 (yelling in Spanish) 
 He commands you! 
 -(Verity coughing) -(panting) 
 Oh, my God. 
 -Andy? -Oh, my God. 
 I... 
 -(gasping) -You all right? Easy, easy. 
 Whoa, what's wrong? What happened to Verity? 
 Hey, hey, hey, hey. Stay away from her. 
 -Wh... What did I do? -Stay away from her. 
 In and out. That's right. 
 -Stay here. -Andy, tell me what I did! 
 -What did I do?! -Stay! Hey! 
 ROSE: Deep breaths. In and out. 
 We need to get her to a doctor. 
 -(croaking): I'm fine. -No, you're not. 
 Andy. Andy. 
 (muffled): Andy. Andy! 
 Andy! 
 -Help me! -(gasps) 
 Shelby, you get Caleb and Harper over to the Holstroms' until I come back. 
 Verity, I'm gonna take you to-to Dr. Flores. 
 -I think she'll be awake. Come on. -(coughing, gasping) 
 Easy. Easy. Easy. 
 I-I didn't mean to hurt her. 
 Verity, it was an accident. 
 (gasps) 
 Okay, honey, I'm gonna need you to come with me. 
 -All right? -Wait, where's he going? 
 Where are you taking him? 
 There is a procedure we have to follow, Caleb. 
 -Um, I'm sorry. -But he's coming back, right? He's coming back. 
 Look, Caleb, we got to go, all right? 
 -No, stop. -Come on. 
 -Caleb, come on. -Stop. 
 -Let me go! Stop! -SHELBY: Harper. 
 I'm sorry. 
 (crying) 
 (ghostly, whispering voices) 
 (exhales) 
 In the name of Jesus Christ... show yourself to me. 
 (distorted gasp) 
 * 
 * 
 (gunshot) 
 (gasps) 
 (groaning softly) 
 (demonic voice): Aeternum vale. 
 (gunshot) 
 (gasps) 
 (panting) 
 Mother, I want to go home. 
 (splash) 
 (retching) 
 (coughs) 
 (retches) 
 (panting) 
 (grunts) 
 ("Anthony" by Andrea Litkei playing faintly) 
 (clacking) 
 Aeternum vale. 
 (jangling) 
 (creaking) 
 (screaming) 
 No! 
 (gasps) 
 (panting) 
 (crickets chirping, birds calling) 
 -(gasps) -(sounds stop) 
 -(exhales) -(natural sounds resume) 
 You heard something. 
 What was it? 
 Nothing at all. 
 That's a start. 
 (exhales) 
 I should get back. 
 Okay. 
 (sighs) 
 (chuckles) 
 Peter. 
 Thank you. 
 (engine turns off) 
 (raspy): I thought you were taking me to the doctor. 
 It was my fault. 
 Truck shouldn't get in trouble because I woke him up. 
 (panting) 
 What's wrong with you? 
 (car door opens, closes) 
 (panting) 
 Why are you doing this?! 
 Why?! 
 Why are you hurting my family?! Why?! 
 Why?! 
 (panting) 
 I want you to leave. 
 (Andy panting)
