 ♪ Yeah, come on, hey, look ♪ Hey, baby girl. It's Daddy. 
 I'm on my way to the hospital to see you be born. 
 Little Ophelia. (CHUCKLES) 
 You know, your mom wanted you to be named Riana. 
 (CLICKS TONGUE) I wore her down. 
 (CHUCKLES) (PHONE RINGS) 
 Oh. 
 It's like she knows we're talking about her. 
 Hey, Mama Bear. 
 Roger, you said you wouldn't miss another one of these, not after you missed RJ. 
 Yeah, well, I... who knew he would slip out so fast? 
 (GROANS) I'm already eight centimeters and ready to pop. 
 Okay, well, I'm ten minutes out. 
 No popping till I get there. Cross your legs or something. 
 Not funny. Not... (LINE CLICKS) 
 (WHISPERS): funny. lt's not funny. 
 (GUNSHOT) 
 (TIRES SCREECH) 
 (GUNSHOT) 
 (SIREN CHIRPS) 
 Adam-9 requesting emergency backup. 
 Stoller Autos. Shots fired. 
 Adam-9, acknowledged. 
 Backup en route. 
 (GUN COCKS) MAN: Lose the gun. 
 Uh, don't. Please. (STAMMERS) 
 Hey, look, my-my wife, at this minute, is about to give birth to my baby girl. 
 I-I don't know if you're a parent or not, but... (GROANS) I'm begging you, man. 
 Please, don't... 
 Don't make my daughter and my son at home... 
 ...grow up without a father, man. 
 (SIREN WAILING IN DISTANCE) I'm begging you. Please. 
 On the ground. 
 (WHISPERS): Come on, man. Facedown. 
 Close your eyes. 
 Bam! You're dead. 
 What? Wh-What did I do wrong? 
 I checked left, then I checked right! 
 But you didn't check left again. 
 And then an 18-wheeler tractor-trailer came out of nowhere and, bam, hit the side of your car. 
 You're dead. (SCOFFS) 
 Tractor-trailers can't drive on residential streets. 
 Okay. So he gets a ticket and you get dead. (SIGHS) 
 You're making me a nervous wreck. 
 Okay. Well, it's better a nervous one than a "bloody pileup on the side of the highway" kind. 
 Okay? Let's ease in. 
 (WHISTLING) 
 What is that? 
 I call this the Soup Test. 
 A little trick to help you avoid quick starts and stops. 
 Now, put your hands up at ten and two. 
 That's 2:30. 
 That's 2:57. Okay. 
 Right there. Now, you keep your eye on the road. 
 I'll worry about the soup. 
 Just nice and steady. 
 Eyes on the road, okay? 
 Even if another car suddenly stops in front of you or your phone rings or a bee flies in. A bee. 
 And it just lands right here on your nose. Keep... 
 W-Watch the road. 
 (TIRES SCREECH) 
 (SHOUTS) Hot! 
 I can't deal with this. I'm done. Hey. 
 Hey. Hey. Riana! 
 Where you going? Riana! 
 I'm walking home! 
 Enjoy your soup! 
 But you got to put the brake on! 
 Hey! 
 You got to put it in... 
 I should've went with gazpacho. 
 MOLLY: I need to know why. Why'd you end it? 
 'Cause my dad killed Ben's dog. 
 You tell me what you want me to do, and I'll do it. 
 MOLLY: You need to figure it out with your dad. 
 That's what I want. 
 (INDISTINCT CHATTER) 
 (LOCK BUZZES) 
 (DOOR OPENS) 
 (CHUCKLES) 
 (GRUNTS) 
 Well, look who's back. 
 A ray of sunshine on a rainy day. 
 What's up, son? 
 You just in the neighborhood? 
 If you knew about that dog, then you know who it belonged to. 
 So why'd you kill it? 
 Says the guy who threatened to kill me. 
 Answer the question. 
 I never meant for that pup to get hurt. 
 I asked the wrong people to send a message that I needed to see you. 
 And I think they just misinterpreted. 
 (CHUCKLES) 
 So that's your idea of reaching out? 
 Sounds like you need to get some new people, Dad. 
 Well, now, that's pretty easy to say from where you sit. 
 You ever been on the inside? 
 I didn't put you here. No. 
 No, you didn't. I know that. 
 I'm just trying to tell you why it got out of hand and maybe, you know, that I'm... sorry. 
 What? 
 You heard me. 
 I know what I put you through. 
 Hit you more times than I should've. 
 Now, some of that was drinking, but not all of it. 
 I was raised that way, Martin. 
 I'm not trying to make excuses here. 
 But I'm just telling you... 
 What are you doing? 
 What is this right now? 
 Nothing. 
 Just a little conversation. 
 I want to maybe, you know, be able to check in every once in a while. 
 Hey, you want to do something for me? 
 Stay away from me and anybody that I care about. 
 You got that? 
 I practically suffered third-degree burns, and I smelled like chowder for the rest of the day because Riana can't seem to park with any nuance. 
 Mm-hmm. "Mm-hmm"? 
 What is that? What do you mean, "mm-hmm"? 
 That was the end, right? I was responding to you. 
 Ah! I can't work like this. 
 Where's Riggs? 
 Took off three days ago without any word. 
 And here it is that I'm thinking that he's changed. 
 Mm-hmm. 
 Scorsese... 
 What's up with him? 
 Banter deficit. Start talking. 
 Vic's Michael Diamond, owner of Diamond Global Imports. 
 His bodyguard said that he was... 
 Mikey "the Bullfrog" Diamond. Bullfrog? 
 That's a nickname? 
 On account of his gastrointestinal issues. 
 MURTAUGH: I've studied this guy. 
 West Coast crime syndicate capo. 
 He went legit about ten years ago. 
 SCORSESE: Not sure it took. 
 Pretty sure this is a mob execution. 
 One to the head, one to the chest. 
 Long-range shot, about a hundred yards out. 
 One story up. 
 Yeah. At least. 
 How'd you know that? 
 All right, people, we have a hot crime scene here. 
 I want zero contamination. 
 We need to be very methodical... RIGGS: Hey, Rog! 
 Where the hell have you been, Riggs? 
 Uh, finding the murder weapon. 
 The murder weapon, which you are now contaminating. 
 Could you put it down? Hey, why don't you relax. 
 All right? I'm not touching it. 
 The gun, which you are holding, is an M25 bolt-action. 
 Our suspect is a professional contract killer, about five foot ten and a half. 
 He smokes Putnam filtered cigarettes. 
 If you run any prints on him, the name "Frank Kelso" will pop up. 
 What is it, Riggs? What? 
 Oh, sorry, are we still worried about contaminating the crime scene? 
 We are always concerned with contaminating crime sc... 
 Oh, dear. 
 See, Rog, you do need me. 
 (SIREN WAILING IN DISTANCE) 
 I mean, I drive all the way down there, you know, expecting the S.O.B. to say just about anything... 
 ...and then he goes and says the one thing I didn't expect. 
 CAHILL: He's sorry. 
 I mean, what's he trying to pull? 
 You went down there looking for confrontation. 
 He didn't give it to you, now you're furious. 
 But what if he had given it to you? 
 What then? 
 I don't know. 
 It's messing with my head, I know that. 
 Well, you don't have to be in Texas for that to happen. 
 Every move you make is a response to this guy. 
 You're letting him control your life. 
 Not like I got a choice in the matter. 
 Talk to him, don't talk to him. 
 Either way, you have to let go of all the rage and hurt you carry inside. 
 Or you'll never find the peace you're looking for. 
 Can't say "never." 
 I mean, he's got to die at some point, right? 
 Right? 
 Meet Frank Kelso. 
 16 years I've been chasing this guy. 
 We used to call him Murtaugh's white whale. 
 You know, Moby Dick? 
 We're familiar. 
 What's up with all the notebooks? 
 I started with the Ray Stoller killing, from the night Riana was born. 
 Then I worked backward. 
 Every hit that he might have ever been involved with. 
 And then back to the office supply store, 'cause I had to buy more books to keep track of Frank since Stoller. 
 That's how I was gonna bring him in. 
 Why didn't you just buy them all at the same time? 
 Yeah, tha-that would have worked, too. 
 Are all of the notebooks as empty as this one? 
 Frankie, uh, turned out to be a lot harder to find than I expected. 
 I kept that picture of the Stoller family to remind me why I keep looking. 
 Any questions? 
 Any questions that do not have anything to do with notebook purchases? 
 How do you propose we find him? 
 Frankie Kelso is a professional ghost, capable of vanishing without a trace. 
 I say we start with notebook number one. 
 And then we painstakingly and methodically go through all of these books... BAILEY: Found him. 
 Screen grab from the garage's security camera shows Kelso getting out of his car. 
 And a BOLO just spotted the same car near a houseboat on Terminal Island. 
 Really? 
 Do you want me to put it in one of the notebooks that you have? 
 Take a tactical team with you and go get your white whale. 
 Trust me, you might want body armor this time. 
 Yeah, Rog. I'm not worried about a 70-year-old man. 
 Age is meaningless when you're an unstoppable killing machine. 
 You know, it's those funny little nose and ear hairs on the killing machine that throws me off, though. 
 Wait. Hold up. 
 Might be booby-trapped. 
 Trip wires, bombs, state-of-the-art weaponry. 
 All right, we kick this door in, we may as well be dead. 
 Right, right, right. 
 I wanted you to kick it in. 
 OFFICER: Living room clear! OFFICER 2: Bathroom clear! 
 Well, looks like your killing machine's a little constipated. 
 I knew it. 
 He's gone. 
 A ghost. A phantom. 
 He's probably in... Mexico. (BOAT MOTOR REVS) 
 (SCOFFS) Or a boat leaving the marina. 
 Call the Coast Guard. 
 Don't let that boat get to open water. 
 Yes, sir. 
 (SIRENS WAILING) 
 Damn it. 
 COAST GUARD: Unidentified fishing boat, this is the Coast Guard. 
 Return to harbor. 
 Return to harbor immediately. 
 TAC TEAM COMMANDER: All units, suspect is not on the boat. 
 Repeat. Boat is a decoy. 
 Tough break, Murtaugh. 
 Looks like he got away from you again. 
 Take the next left. 
 You're getting sloppy in your old age, Frankie. 
 It's not like you to leave your fingerprints behind. 
 It's not like me 'cause it wasn't me. The prints were planted. 
 So you're saying this is all a-a setup. 
 Right. 
 Nah, I ain't buying it. 
 A leopard doesn't change its stripes. I said right. 
 Turn right! 
 How's your little girl, by the way? 
 At the moment? 
 Probably worried sick that her dad's not home to take her driving. 
 Driving, already. 
 Where does the time go? 
 Pull back here. 
 Now get out. 
 Slowly. 
 Give me your gun. 
 Keep your hands where I can see 'em. 
 Move. 
 Walk. 
 Stop. 
 Hey, look. You don't have to do this. 
 Should've done it a long time ago. 
 Don't turn around. 
 Hey, listen, man, t-this... Shh. 
 (URINATING) 
 (EXHALES) 
 There we go. 
 Been holding it in since I clocked you cops outside my place. 
 (ZIPPER CLOSES) 
 Dr. Levin says it's not good for my prostate. 
 Edward Levin? 
 The urologist? 
 You go to him, too? 
 (SMACKS LIPS) 
 He's a good man. Gentle. 
 Take this. 
 It's a phone number I need you to run down for me. 
 And why should I do that? 
 Two reasons. 
 So I don't shoot you, and 'cause I didn't kill Diamond. 
 That's the number of who set me up. 
 Do you want to, maybe, help me log the evidence instead of sitting on it? 
 No. 
 For your information, Bailey, I'm gonna go through Roger's notes on Kelso. 
 Oh, the blank notes? 
 Well... semi-blank. 
 Something about somebody called "The Panther." 
 And some sad little drawings of a panther. 
 (PHONE RINGING) 
 Yeah. 
 MURTAUGH: Riggs, it's me. 
 Rog. How the heck did I beat you back to the office? 
 I mean, you were in a car, and I was in a boat. 
 That's a good question. 
 Look, I need you to run a number for me. 
 Riggs, tell me you know how to run a number. 
 Of course I know how to run a number, Roger. 
 Give me a break. (WHISTLES) Hey. 
 (WHISPERING): Come here. How do I run a number? 
 All right, go. 
 323-555-0129. 
 Hey, why are you giving this to me? 
 Usually, the B-team handles this kind of thing. 
 Because I trust you. 
 You're the best damn cop I know. 
 "You're the best damn cop I know"? 
 What? I don't tell him that enough. 
 Murtaugh's in trouble. 
 RIGGS: I mean, there's not much. 
 You know, there was a mention of somebody called "The Panther," and then a list of podcasts he wanted to download. 
 Okay, The Panther was Kelso's contact, the broker who hired him out, gave him his targets. 
 His real name was Danny... something. 
 BAILEY: Danny Mancini. 
 No current address; he was born in Hollywood. 
 He's been in and out of prison for the past decade. 
 San Quentin, Lompoc, Amarillo. 
 Texas? 
 You know another Amarillo? 
 If Kelso's gonna lay low, this might be his first stop. 
 You okay? 
 I got to make a phone call. 
 Two visits, and a phone call? 
 I feel positively courted. 
 I knew this was gonna be a mistake. 
 I'm betting you got a favor to ask me, so go ahead and ask it. What do you need? 
 Four years ago, you served time with a Danny Mancini. 
 You remember him? 
 Yeah, he wasn't in my cellblock, but I knew him. 
 Not well. 
 You know where I can find him? 
 Well, he still has some crew serving here, so... 
 Not the friendliest cats, but I'll ask around. 
 Now, see, that wasn't so hard, was it? 
 It's important, okay? 
 Yeah, it must be if you're calling me. 
 (PHONE BEEPS) 
 (OPERA MUSIC PLAYING) 
 You set me up, Danny? 
 Frankie. 
 Long time. 
 You don't look happy to see me. 
 'Cause you're a fugitive. 
 You hit Mikey Diamond. 
 Whoa, whoa, whoa. 
 This is The Panther? 
 I-I had a whole different image in my head. 
 More sleek and catlike. 
 You set me up, didn't you? 
 Easy, Frank. 
 You texted me, and set a meet. Same as you used to. 
 I-I swear to you. Frankie, it wasn't me. 
 Then who?! 
 We've known each other a long time, so I'm gonna give you the courtesy of counting before I put a bullet in your head. 
 One, (GUN COCKS) two... 
 Okay, wait. 
 Wait. About a month ago, a kid came by here, uh, 20-something. 
 Uh, said he had a job. 
 He was asking questions about you. 
 Well, who was he? 
 (SCOFFS) I didn't get a name. 
 Red hair, tall, lean, good shape. 
 Oh, and he was tooling around in a sweet vintage auto. 
 (CHUCKLES) Alfa Romeo, convertible. 
 Baby blue. 
 (DOOR OPENS, BELLS JINGLE) 
 Customer. 
 RIGGS: Hi, there. 
 I'm looking for something really old, and I thought maybe you could help me out. 
 Sorry, we're closed. 
 You know, it's actually... it's two things. 
 It's two things that I'm looking for. 
 One's, like, middle-age, oldish, and the other one's extremely old. 
 Find yourself another antique shop. 
 Uh, no. 
 This is the antique shop I want. 
 I mean, because you're the guy making all the deals, right? 
 I mean, you're The Panther. 
 (GUN COCKS) Nah. 
 Not quick enough, buddy. 
 Tell me where my partner is, or I'm-a put one in your head. 
 Riggs, right here. 
 Don't need anybody getting crazy. 
 I got everything under control. 
 Tell your partner to drop his gun. 
 Riggs, Frankie, Frankie, Riggs. 
 Doesn't look like you got everything under control, Rog. 
 MURTAUGH: Yeah, well, it's deceptive... 
 Who the hell are these guys? 
 Mike Diamond's guys. They think I killed their boss. 
 Maybe because you did kill their boss? 
 No, that's what I'm trying to tell... 
 (GUN CLICKS) 
 Put the weapon down. 
 Well, Rog. 
 Finally caught your big fish here. How does it feel? 
 Not too good. 
 Why is that? 
 He didn't do it. 
 MURTAUGH: My gut says that Kelso didn't do this. 
 Despite all of the evidence that says he did? 
 Yes. Roger, you've been chasing this guy for over a decade, for doing exactly this. Mm, right... 
 Don't forget about the abduction. 
 Yeah. That's my point exactly. 
 Why abduct me if he could've just fled the scene? 
 Gee, Rog, this guy pees in front of you and all of a sudden you're Patty Hearst. 
 Like, what happened to you? Whoa, whoa, he peed on you? 
 He didn't pee on me. 
 No, not on him. He peed in front of him. 
 What, to show dominance? RIGGS: I think so. 
 He has what Dr. Levin calls a lazy prostate. 
 (GROANS) We share urologists, not symptoms. 
 Ugh. AVERY: Roger, by all accounts, Frank Kelso is a hired killer. 
 And I think it's possible that he's not that guy anymore. 
 RIGGS: And I think it's possible you're the most gullible cop in America. 
 MURTAUGH: And I think it's possible that after working with you for two years, one day with a real human actually gives me clarity to trust my gut. 
 Oh, really? Now you're trusting your gut? 
 Yes. RIGGS: Well, I think it's possible you're just absolutely ridiculous. Yeah, I think... 
 Maybe Frankie should be your partner. Yeah. 
 Riggs. Riggs. Possible... what? 
 You have a call from Amarillo Federal Prison. 
 Take a message. Because here's my thing... 
 What? What's your thing? 
 Riggs, it's your... I know who it is, Bailey. 
 Send it to my cell. 
 Would you please...? Something. Yeah, I got it. 
 Amarillo. Riggs's father. 
 That's how worried he was. 
 He actually called his dad for help. 
 That's how he tracked you down. 
 Mm. Hmm. 
 Hey, what do you want? (CLEARS THROAT) 
 NATHAN: Just wanted to see how everything panned out. 
 See if you maybe needed anything else. 
 Nope. 
 Everything panned out. 
 Well, that's good. 
 Okay. Uh, bye. 
 Uh, wait a second. Hold on, man. 
 I get one phone call a week here. 
 You hang up, you know, that's it for me for another few days, so... 
 I'm not doing this. 
 You can give me 30 seconds. 
 Why don't you humor me? 
 Tell me something about yourself. 
 What do you want to know? 
 I don't know. 
 Tell me about where you live. 
 What's your place like? 
 What's my place like? 
 Hell, I already know you're a cop. 
 Man, I did not see that coming back then. 
 Look, I know I was hard on you. 
 You can say whatever you want about me, but, uh, you sure turned out all right. 
 30 seconds is up. 
 Oh, don't hang up on me... 
 INMATE: Who are we talking to, Riggs? 
 He hung up on me. 
 Is there a problem here, boys? Yeah. 
 I hear you've been asking questions about Danny Mancini. 
 He's got a lot of friends in here. 
 (COUGHING) 
 RIANA: What kind of monster are you? 
 What... are you...? Hey. 
 Excuse me, is she talking to me like this? 
 RIANA: No, the other monster that got in my head and ruined everything. 
 Riana had her driver's test today. 
 I know. And I failed, Dad. 
 Well, listen, a lot of people fail on their first time. 
 Because you were in my head the whole time. 
 (GASPS) Me? 
 
 
 
 You! MURTAUGH: Oh, co... 
 Hands at ten and two or you're dead. 
 Check your mirrors or you're dead. 
 Feel the wheels, turn into a skid, tap your breaks, check for cats or bam! You're dead. 
 MURTAUGH: Well, here's the good news. 
 You remembered all my delicious tips. 
 You must've been close to passing. 
 I didn't even make it out of the parking lot. 
 I got confused trying to find the emergency brake and I pushed the wrong button, so when the instructor said it was over and I went to turn the car off, I really turned it back on. 
 Then he got out and it rolled over his foot and there was a crunch. 
 So I hope you're happy. 
 There was a crunch. 
 TRISH: She was a wreck. 
 From the moment we got there, it was awful. 
 Poor kid. 
 So I guess we should be relieved, huh? 
 Relieved? 
 Roger, I'm not relieved. 
 I need her to start driving. 
 Well, clearly, she's not ready to drive. 
 I mean, she ran over the instructor's foot. 
 Because you got in her head. 
 Me? You, Roger. 
 Why is it always Roger? Why is it always you? 
 That is a very good question. 
 You are the one who took her driving and scared the hell out of her. 
 I was teaching her the horrors of the road. 
 The Soup Test, Roger? Yeah. 
 When is she ever gonna be driving with soup? 
 She can go her whole life and never drive with soup. 
 Maybe I was a little overly cautious about teaching her how to drive. Hmm. 
 Fix it. 
 Frankie. 
 More questions? 
 Or are you just going to ask the same ones louder? 
 You know, my partner thinks you didn't kill this guy for some insane reason. 
 What do you think? 
 I think guys like you never change. 
 Now, my partner, he kept records of all your greatest hits. 
 Here, take a look. There's pictures and everything. 
 Okay, this is... this is Dan Hughes. 
 You got Robert Batts. 
 Oh, Kevin Conti. 
 Billy Grimes. Oh. 
 Here's the one where you and Rog started your love affair. 
 Ray Stoller. 
 And last, but not least. 
 Now, Frankie, what do these guys all have in common? 
 One to the head and one to the chest. 
 Got a little bit of a pattern emerging here, don't we? 
 You got me. 
 What's that? 
 I did it. 
 I killed Mike Diamond. 
 I don't believe it. 
 Yeah, me, either. 
 Roger's right. 
 He didn't do it. 
 I don't... 
 What just happened in there? 
 MURTAUGH: Trust me. 
 You are gonna hate me a lot less after you see this. 
 Hey, baby girl, it's Daddy. 
 I'm on my way to the hospital to see you be born. 
 Little Ophelia. 
 Ophelia? 
 It was that or Edwina. Oh. 
 That's your other grandmother's name, which I don't think anybody likes. No. 
 MURTAUGH: There she is. 
 The most beautiful, precious girl in the world. 
 Daddy promises to make sure nothing bad ever happens to you. 
 You see? There. 
 Right there. That is why I may have gone a little overboard with your driving lessons. 
 I made a promise to you to protect you. 
 (SIGHS) You're my baby girl. 
 I'm almost 17. 
 I'm not your baby girl anymore. 
 And if you don't stop treating me like it, I'm never gonna learn how to function on my own. 
 Yeah, well, driving is a very big deal. 
 And I got to make sure that you're ready, ready, ready, ready. 
 Oh, yeah? Yeah. 
 Like you? What do you mean? 
 Look at this. 
 You have one hand on the wheel and is that a cell phone? 
 Yeah. No Bluetooth? 
 You know that's illegal. 
 Yeah, well, but that's back then. 
 I mean, we didn't even use seat belts. 
 And besides, your mother was on the phone. 
 The 18-wheeler that just crashed into your passenger side doesn't care who was calling. 
 Bam! 
 You're dead. 
 (SIREN CHIRPS) 
 Wait a minute. 
 Pause that tape. 
 A baby blue convertible. 
 This car was at the scene of Ray Stoller's murder and Danny Mancini's antique store 16 years later. 
 It's not a coincidence. 
 I bet whoever owns this car framed Frankie. 
 And-and why aren't you writing this down? 
 These are brand-new notebooks. 
 Because Frankie Kelso confessed last night. 
 Frankie confessed? 
 You don't check your e-mail? 
 RIGGS: Rog. I know, I know. 
 Frankie confessed, but I still don't think he did it. 
 Yeah, no, listen... 
 Why don't you ever back me up? 
 How many times have I had your back? 
 Like the time that you ripped up a signed confession because you said the suspect 
 "didn't have murder in his eyes." Okay, well, Rog... 
 Or the time that you said the guy didn't 
 "smell like a killer." 
 Okay, no killer smells like lavender. 
 Just once, Riggs, I need you to have my back. 
 Hey, Rog. What? 
 You're right. 
 Watch this. 
 Heads up, Frankie. 
 Green tea? 
 I'll be damned. You're right. 
 He did close his right eye. 
 RIGGS: Yep. 
 I noticed him shooting lefty at the antique store. 
 Yeah, macular degeneration. 
 Big black hole in the middle of my right eye. 
 Started a few years ago. 
 It's not that interesting. 
 You know, it's a little interesting. 
 Ah, see... that means you're left-eye dominant. 
 Right? 
 Now, see this little stain? 
 That is from our shooter, who's right-eye dominant, sitting and waiting for his target. 
 It's not your weapon. 
 MURTAUGH: So, if your right eye is blind, how did you shoot Mike Diamond with this weapon? 
 I guess it was just a lucky shot. 
 Frankie, whoever set you up didn't know about your eye. 
 So who are you covering for? 
 FRANKIE: No one. 
 You've been trying to put me away for years, Ahab. 
 Just take the win. 
 I never read the book Moby Dick, but I'm sure the whale didn't do time for a crime he didn't commit. 
 We're actually tracking the car of the real killer. 
 In the meantime, you're free to go. 
 So now what am I supposed to do? 
 Just walk out of here? 
 No consequences? 
 RIGGS: Ah, Frankie, as long as you don't commit any felonies or take a leak in front of me and my partner, we don't care what you do. 
 I got a hit from the DMV on that blue convertible. 
 The last official sale was in 2001 to Ray Stoller. 
 Who died years ago. 
 Which is why ownership passed on to his son, Sam Stoller. 
 He took over registration in 2011 and six weeks ago, he was discharged from the Army, Special Ops, sniper division. 
 Okay, get that information to the uni who's shadowing Frankie and find out where Stoller is now. 
 DISPATCHER: Unit Five, possible suspect, Sam Stoller, identified. 
 Six foot, red hair. 
 Unit Five, Detectives Murtaugh and Riggs are less than five minutes from your position. 
 Do not engage until backup is on site. 
 Bailey says the uni's not answering his walkie. 
 Sounds like we're heading into a situation. 
 All right, so Ray Stoller's son kills Diamond for ordering the hit on his dad, and then frames the actual hit man. 
 Pretty slick. Yeah, but why does Frankie confess? I don't know. 
 Maybe Frankie thinks he deserves to be punished. 
 Yeah. Coincidentally, so does Sam Stoller.

 I was just gonna go make myself some tea. 
 Want some? Sorry, I got nothing stronger. 
 My internist made me give up drinking. 
 You know who I am. 
 I know why you're here, too. 
 I'm okay with that. 
 I got it coming. 
 Just want you to know it wasn't personal. 
 It was just a job. 
 You murdered my father. 
 He stole a lot of money from the wrong people. 
 Not to make a better life for you and your mom, only for him. 
 To feed his appetites. 
 Cocaine, gambling... 
 (GROANS) 
 He's bleeding. 
 Wait, Rog, it's a trap! 
 (GUNSHOTS) 
 We got to get to him before he bleeds out. 
 (GUNSHOTS CONTINUE) 
 Ready? Let's go. 
 Frank, can you hear me? 
 (GUNSHOT) 
 Hey, we got to get him to a doctor. 
 All right. 
 Let's get you guys in the car. 
 Okay, wait. Well, what about you? 
 Somebody's got to get this bird out of the perch. 
 Yeah, but I can't leave you by yourself. 
 What are you talking about? Who's gonna lay down cover fire for you? 
 We all go in the car. Why are you doing this right now? 
 Oh, for crap sake! 
 Tell him he's the best cop you know. 
 Tell him you love him. 
 Enough with all this sexual tension. 
 Just come on, come on, come on. 
 Don't kill him. 
 Sorry, Frankie, I don't take requests. 
 Go, Rog, go!

 MURTAUGH: En route to Long Beach Hospital. 
 I need emergency personnel standing by to receive a gunshot victim. 
 White male, 70s. 
 DISPATCHER: Copy that. 
 I'm getting blood on your nice upholstery. 
 Don't worry about that. (PHONE RINGING) 
 You can answer that. 
 Uh, not right now. 
 Who's calling? 
 It's my daughter. 
 I'll call her back later. (RINGING CONTINUES) 
 Hey, that little girl saved your life once. 
 Take her call. 
 Hey, Ri. 
 Dad, I'm going to the DMV to retake my test. 
 And I was thinking I could maybe use a little last minute pep talk? 
 Oh, come on, you don't want my voice in your head. 
 (SIGHS) It's already there anyway. 
 At least give me something I can use. 
 Okay, don't focus on the things that can go wrong. 
 You know, all the dangers out there. 
 Focus on the road ahead. 
 And-and the wonderful places that they can take you. 
 You know, the only drivers who never get hit are the ones that never leave the house. 
 I'm gonna get hit? 
 No, no, no, I'm saying if you're too scared, then you'll never go where the road is trying to take you. 
 You get it? Just remember that the brake is on the right. 
 No, it's on the left. 
 I know. I was testing. 
 You passed. Okay, look, I got to go, baby. I love you. 
 Love you. 
 You're a good dad, Roger. 
 Glad I didn't kill you way back when. 
 Agreed. 
 (SIREN WAILING) 
 STOLLER: Come on out! 
 I'm not gonna kill you. 
 (WHISTLES) 
 Hey, Roger... do me a favor. 
 What's that? 
 Take care of Lucille for me. 
 Hey, none of that. 
 All right? 
 You're gonna finish fixing up that boat, and you're gonna sail her around the world, old man. 
 Maybe I'll even help out. 
 Well, I'll get my kids to help out. (CHUCKLES) 
 You just hang in there, all right? 
 You hear me? 
 Frankie? 
 (SIREN STOPS) 
 Frankie? 
 I mean, he's nuts if he thinks we're gonna be, you know, pen pals or phone buddies or something. 
 You don't want to feel like you're in his debt. 
 In his debt? 
 The guy does me one favor in the last 20 years, all right? 
 I'm not in his debt. 
 That's fair. 
 But, Riggs, if you can't talk about him without getting angry, then... What if I want to be angry? 
 All right? What if I'm comfortable with being angry? 
 Seriously, right? (PHONE VIBRATING) 
 Wh-What's wrong with hating somebody... 
 ...that deserves to be hated? Riggs. 
 Yeah? Your phone. 
 Not much of a celebration. 
 Been chasing this guy for 16 years, you finally get him off the street... that's got to feel good. 
 You'd think. 
 The guy was a killer, Roger. 
 Yeah, but not for the past 16 years. 
 The guy who died today was a lonely old man who had nothing except an unfinished boat that never made it to the water. 
 Celebrate that, then... the fact that you never got a boat. 
 Dodged a bullet. 
 RIGGS: Hey, Rog, I got to get out for a couple days. 
 I got to go take care of something. 
 Couple days? Where you going? 
 So curious. 
 Later, buddy. 
 Hey, Riggs. Yo. 
 Not for nothing, but I know you, uh... called your dad to find me. 
 And... that couldn't have been easy. 
 So, thank you. 
 It was worth it, Rog. 
 ♪ We tape it up and wear it out... ♪ I passed! (LAUGHING) 
 ♪ Soak through our callous skin ♪ 
 ♪ ♪ He's not saying anything. 
 Um, why is he not saying anything? 
 Just give him a second. 
 Roger? (GASPS) 
 ♪ When I was a bird... ♪ Ah, yeah. 
 My little girl. (CHUCKLES) 
 Licensed by the State of California to drive a two-ton vehicle down the highway. (CHUCKLES) 
 Mom? 
 Roger? Oh, yeah, hey... 
 I'm proud of you, Riana. 
 And I'm happy. 
 And I'm confident that you will be a great driver. 
 Cool. Can I have the keys? 
 I told Jake and Lela I'd meet them to celebrate. 
 (STAMMERS): The keys to the car? 
 Oh. Thank you. 
 Mm-hmm. 
 Oh... 
 I had an idea. 
 Maybe I'll order soup. (TRISH LAUGHS) 
 Soup! Yeah. That's funny. 
 Very funny. Yeah. 
 Are we okay with this? 
 I mean, she did pass, right? 
 Well, that girl had no business passing that test. 
 She nearly sideswiped three cars. 
 And I think her instructor was legally blind. 
 What? Mm-hmm. 
 WOMAN: He got jumped in the yard. 
 (LOCK BUZZES) There were three of them. 
 Norteños, a gang that runs the east wing. 
 How bad? 
 Stabbed multiple times in the chest. 
 They just missed his aorta. 
 He's stable now. 
 Your dad's a tough customer. 
 So, he's gonna live? 
 Probably. This time. 
 The Norteños went to war with your dad, and they're not gonna stop. 
 So, I can patch him up, but I can't save him. 
 That's up to you. 
 (SCOFFS) 
 What am I supposed to do? 
 If it were my dad, and I had a cop in the family, I'd start with the warden and pull every string available for pulling till I got him out of here.
