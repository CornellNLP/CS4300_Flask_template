 ♪ Oh, the weather outside is frightful... ♪ 
 Man : If you don't mind me asking, what's a pretty lady like you doing eating alone here on Christmas Eve? 
 Missed my flight home. 
 Where's home at? 
 Hey, Charlie, you know what I bet this lady wants for Christmas? 
 Some peace and quiet. 
 Me, on the other hand... 
 Thanks. 
 Been a lousy day. 
 This'll be the first time I haven't been home for Christmas in... well, ever. 
 Still smiling. That's something. 
 So that's my excuse for drinking alone on Christmas. 
 What's yours? 
 Oh, I'm not big on excuses. 
 Besides... I'm not drinking alone now, am I? 
 No, you're not. 
 Now I just got one more question. 
 Hmm? 
 You gonna finish that steak? 
 Damn right I'm gonna finish it. 
 That a girl. 
 (laughs) 
 I want you to know I don't normally go home with guys I've met in bars. 
 Oh, good. That makes two of us. 
 (laughs softly) 
 Wow. 
 This is, um... sparse. 
 Yeah, you know, I've only been here for about a year, year and a half, so... 
 That can't be comfortable. 
 Well, it's better than a standard issue cot. 
 Military? 
 Or prison? 
 I did a couple tours in Iraq. 
 Also spent a night in county... back in high school. 
 Cow-tipping laws are pretty strict around here. 
 Oh. (laughs) 
 (pop bottle top, top clatters on table) 
 That is a very, very small tree. 
 Oh, yeah, they-they gave those to us at work. 
 Here. 
 Brightens up the place. 
 Yeah, it does. 
 (laughs) 
 (hinges squeak) 
 (door closes) 
 Couch is comfy. 
 It's a little rough around the edges, but... 
 I see some potential. 
 Yeah? 
 Yeah. 
 Not such a bad Christmas. 
 No. 
 Not bad at all. 
 (seagulls screeching) 
 Murtaugh :  The man has no decency. 
 ♪ Just keep those sleigh bells jingling ♪ 
 That's just not a few strands of twinkly lights. 
 That's gaudy. 
 Tasteless, even. 
 And with all the juice that he's using, he's gonna overpower our grid. 
 The grid? 
 Our power grid. 
 This is real. We're vulnerable. 
 (Trish chuckles) 
 Come on, Roger, every year McNeiles do this, and every year you complain about it. 
 The man's consistent. 
 One of the many qualities I admire. 
 Thank you, son. 
 This time of year is not about decoration. 
 This is about family. 
 Mm-hmm. 
 It's about togetherness. 
 Totally agree, Dad. 
 So can I count on you to drive me to Julie's house tomorrow night? She's having a few friends over and... 
 I'll drive you, Ri. 
 Whose car? 
 Yeah. 
 You know what? Sorry. 
 Not until, you know, after tomorrow. 
 You know, after we get our presents. 
 Oh. (laughs) 
 He thinks he's getting a car. 
 (both laugh) 
 You're not getting a car, RJ. 
 You're not getting a car. 
 (chuckles) You guys. Okay. 
 Sure, yeah. 
 You wink at me again. (chuckles) 
 I dare you. 
 Look, all year long, people are out and about, moving and shaking... 
 Having fun? 
 Not home. 
 Trish : Listen, your father's right. 
 It's the one time of year we are all in the same place. 
 For a few days. 
 Yeah, so your mother and I are gonna take some time off, and we're gonna spend some family time together, (dishes rattle in the sink) whether you like it or not. 
 (electricity buzzes) 
 (quietly): Okay. 
 McNeile! 
 (door opens and closes) 
 Roger... 
 (dogs barking in the distance) 
 Hey, Jim! 
 Hey, Big Rog! 
 We taking it to the next level over here, or what? 
 The grid. 
 Have you considered the grid? 
 The grid? 
 The electrical grid, Jim. 
 I mean, with all this stuff, it-it's like a fire hazard. 
 You a fireman now, Rog? 
 Is that it? 
 Firemen don't carry guns, Jim. 
 You know what dentists carry? 
 Hmm? 
 High-powered Waterpiks. 
 And floss. 
 Roger! 
 Roger? Get in here. 
 Now. 
 Sorry, Jim. 
 Roger! 
 (stammering): What? 
 What was that? 
 Trish : Uh... sorry. 
 The lights look great. 
 ♪ Outside the snow is falling ♪ 
♪ And friends are calling, "Yoo hoo" ♪ 
 (sleigh bells jingling) 
 Man : Merry Christmas. 
 Merry Christmas. 
 Merry Christmas. 
 Happy holidays. 
 Merry Christmas. 
 (woman screaming) 
 (people exclaiming) 
 (shocked murmuring) 
 (siren wailing in the distance) 
 First of all, he calls me "Big Rog." 
 Then he makes some sort of threatening gesture with floss. 
 I didn't think it was possible to floss threateningly. 
 (grunts) 
 Oh, fair enough. 
 I mean, dealing with McNeile is the worst part of the season. 
 No, the worst part of the holiday season is, well... everything. 
 Everything? You hate it all? 
 Bailey : All right, fellas. 
 Our victim's name is Elena Tull, 25. 
 Lived in the penthouse. 
 Think she offed herself? 
 (sleigh bells jingling) 
 Holidays can be hard on some people. 
 Well, could be, but... if you're gonna take a swan dive, I doubt that you're worried about your feet getting cold on the way down. 
 Hey, you want to give it a rest? 
 (jingling stops) 
 We're not exactly caroling out here. 
 Murtaugh : Hey, come on, man. 
 The guy was just doing his job. 
 Oh, doing his job? 
 Yet another reason why I hate Christmas. 
 Certain dentists notwithstanding, it's a time of year when people exhibit goodwill toward their fellow man. 
 And I like that. 
 (gasps) Oh, my God. 
 My car! 
 Riggs : Oh. 
 What was that about goodwill? 
 Merry Christmas, Big Rog. 
 Bah humbug. 
 (indistinct radio chatter) 
 Nice digs for a nurse. 
 It's not hers. 
 Bailey's looking into the owner. 
 There's a company's name on the deed. 
 Scorsese : Gentlemen, would you join me on the veranda? 
 Victim fell from this ledge, leaving us three options... accident, suicide, murder? 
 This is the question I set out to solve... 
 She was pushed. (grunts) 
 Yep. 
 Takes force to get that kind of damage. 
 I had a different and much more, uh, thorough approach, but, yes, she was pushed. 
 The apartment's under a holding company owned by the victim's boyfriend, an Eduardo Flores. 
 Eddie Flores? 
 Who's Eddie Flores? 
 Avery :  Christmas came early. 
 And Santa put a top cartel associate under the LAPD's tree. 
 Eddie freaking Flores. 
 I knew Eddie back in Texas. 
 Juarez's most eligible drug lord. He's the homicidal nephew of Tito Flores, almost had him busted on a kidnapping case down in Texas, but, the day before trial, our only witness ended up without a head. 
 Which made it hard to testify. 
 It does because it... no mouth. 
 No words. 
 So he's just... (gurgles) 
 No, no words. Well, he screwed up this time, 'cause he's in our town, and we're gonna nail his ass. 
 Just know we're gonna have our hands full. 
 Eddie's not your normal scumbag. 
 And we're not your normal cops. 
 Speaking of which, Captain... 
 Murtaugh, I understand that you had some time off scheduled this week, but we have to roll up our sleeves on this one. 
 And I'm sorry to say that may mean missing out on some family time. 
 In-laws in town? 
 They land in an hour. 
 Let's get to work. 
 Bailey : I got into Elena's phone. 
 There's a string of texts with someone named "H." 
 "He's onto us. I'm scared." 
 Okay, "H" could be a lover and Eddie found out. 
 Good, let's go through all the contacts, look for any "H" s. Henry, Hank... 
 Hector, Hugo. 
 "Hugo"? 
 Hugo. 
 No one has an affair with a Hugo. 
 Guys, are you done doing this whole wild guess thing or do you want to find out? Because Elena's meeting "H" for coffee in 15 minutes. 
 Perfect. I'm gonna go with Harvey. 
 I'm saying Hamburger. 
 Hannah, anyone here named Hannah? 
 Both : Hannah. 
 Excuse me, ma'am? 
 Are you here to meet Elena Tull? 
 Who are you? 
 We're with LAPD. Homicide. 
 That son of a bitch. 
 He killed her, didn't he? 
 Who? 
 No, you first. 
 What do you know? 
 Murtaugh : Doesn't work like that. 
 We ask the questions. 
 Look, let's start with an easy one. 
 What was your relationship with Elena? 
 Friends. 
 Uh... colleagues, I guess you can say. 
 You're a nurse? 
 Journalist. 
 I'm on the city desk at the  L.A. Sentinel. 
 What do you cover? 
 Crimes, drugs. 
 Cartel's rise in L.A. 
 All right, so we can cut the crap. 
 You know exactly who she was dating. 
 Yeah. I know. 
 You know what kind of man he is? 
 More so than you. 
 I was writing a piece on Eddie Flores. 
 Elena was my source. 
 Murtaugh : Did she know how dangerous he was? 
 She knew. 
 At first she didn't know who he was, but she was a bright girl, she caught on. 
 Instead of ending it, she wanted to take him down. 
 So why not go to the cops? 
 You guys have any luck catching Eddie yet? 
 Murtaugh : Elena is dead, and if Eddie finds out that she was  your  source, then your life is in danger, too. 
 So, suggest that maybe you... 
 Keep a low profile, let you guys handle the case. 
 Yeah, I know the drill. 
 I think you're underestimating what Eddie's capable of. 
 I know Eduardo Flores, Detective. 
 And nothing would make me happier than if I was underestimating what you guys are capable of. 
 Do you know where we can find him? 
 Not exactly keeping a low profile. 
 Anyone can find him. 
 Question is, who has the balls to take him down?

 Eddie? 
 Eddie Flores?! 
 Oh, my... 
 That's Eddie. 
 It is you! 
 I haven't seen you since... since you chopped that dude's head off in El Paso. 
 You look great! 
 Woman : Do you know him? 
 He's just a drunk cop named Riggs. 
 That Texas twang... makes me feel at home. 
 Eddie... 
 He's not from Texas. 
 You're right. 
 I'm from Juarez. 
 That's right. 
 Murtaugh : Well, I have not had the pleasure. 
 Oh, my goodness, I'm so sorry. 
 Roger, Eddie. Eddie, Roger. 
 I hear wonderful things about you. 
 In fact, I'm a little nervous. 
 I've never been this close to a sociopath before. 
 (chuckles) 
 Ignore them, they harass me all the time. 
 Just some nonsense from years ago. 
 Murtaugh : No, no, actually, this is about yesterday. 
 Yeah, new nonsense. 
 He threw his girlfriend off a 13-story balcony. 
 She crashed through the roof of a car, severed her spine, split her skull in two, it was a mess! 
 But you seem to be doing great. 
 And you're dating again, that's wonderful. 
 Excuse me. 
 Stay! 
 Please. No, they're leaving now. 
 Oh, no, no. I'm so sorry. 
 Please, no, we've got to go get evidence and subpoenas and all that jazz. 
 Murtaugh : And warrants. 
 We just saw you across the room and had to say hello, so... hello. 
 Just like Texas, Riggs. 
 All bark, no bite. 
 Well this time, it's gonna stick. 
 (barks, laughs) 
 Okay. 
 Just be careful out there. 
 Right, we wouldn't want to lose our heads. 
 (laughing): I see what you did there! 
 You see? Oh! 
 He's getting all pun-ny. 
 Well, it's the holidays. 
 Yes. 
 It makes me feel good. 
 Giddy. 
 All right. 
 Hey, Riggs, you know how cruel this world can be. 
 How's that? 
 Sometimes we lose people, right? 
 People we love. 
 Friends... partners... 
 ...wives. 
 Just, accidents happen, right? 
 Riggs, Riggs. 
 Are you talking about my wife? 
 There's a room full of people here. 
 (crowd screaming) 
 Answer me! 
 Are you talking about my wife?! 
 Did I touch a nerve? 
 I'm sorry, Detective. 
 Not like this, Riggs. 
 Too many people looking. Come on. 
 He's trying to rattle your cage. 
 (Eddie chuckling) 
 You should get a better date. 
 Ah, cut her some slack, Riggs. 
 This time of year, no one wants to be alone. 
 Avery :  What part of no mistakes did you not understand? 
 I got a dozen calls telling me that Riggs nearly pushed Flores off a ledge. 
 He didn't push him. 
 It was more of a... a controlled dangle. 
 Roger, what's going on? 
 The holidays makes him a little nuts. 
 A little nuts, I understand. 
 My father-in-law can't stop telling me about how much he loves "the gays," but you don't see me dangling him off a roof. 
 Yet. 
 Eddie said something about Riggs' wife. 
 It set him off. 
 Do I need to take him off the case? 
 No. 
 We got this. 
 Where is he now? 
 At a storage locker. 
 He's looking through some old El Paso case files. 
 I think his history with Eddie is gonna help us on this one. 
 Avery :  Don't let him get emotional. 
 That's what Eddie wants. (bell jingles) ♪ ♪

Family is everything to me. You need to know the kind of life that you're signing up for. Ugly sweaters, drunk uncles. It's messy. Yeah? Yeah. So, what do you say, cowboy? Are you up for all that? (inhales sharply) I think I'd make a pretty good drunk uncle someday. (laughing): Yeah, you would. ♪ In a one horse open sleigh ♪ You got him to wear the sweater? You set me up. Sorry, babe. Wow. Sorry. (laughs) You all look ridiculous. (all laughing) I look festive. So... He's a keeper. I told you he was a keeper. Trish : He is part of the family. I'm just saying, if Riggs is coming for dinner, you guys won't even notice that I'm gone. It's gonna be the party of the year. Murtaugh : No, the party of the year is gonna be right here. A Murtaugh party! 'Cause ain't no party like a Murtaugh party, 'cause a Murtaugh party don't stop. That's the spirit and you, miss, are gonna be here for the family dinner. Trish : Is there something you want to tell me? Hmm? About what? I don't know, about a missing reindeer? Yeah, Jim McNeile stopped by, said someone stole one of his. Damn. That's terrible. I'm gonna look into that. Which one was it? Let me guess, it was Prancer. Riana : You do know, you can't steal his decorations, right, Dad? Roger Jr. : Hey. Show dad some respect. Hey, you are not getting a car, RJ. Roger, did you take the man's reindeer? I mean, this is a terrible crime. Even though he's been stealing power from us for years now. I just came home to get a cup of coffee and then I'll go back and after I'm wide awake from this coffee and solve the reindeer... (buzzing) Oh. Damn you, McNeile! (door opens) Hey. Brought you something. Oh, Riggs, wow. This is expensive stuff. Uh, well, hap-hap... happiest time of year, right? Oh, it was open. And you closed it. Nice. Well, had to make sure that, you know, it didn't go bad. Yeah, either way, very thoughtful gift. It's more of a bribe. I need you to look at this for me. Sure. Oh, this is from El Paso. Yeah, um... I'm just trying to find any inconsistencies. You know, they said that the truck driver was... he was intoxicated, but I can't find any evidence that supports that. Um... Honestly, I don't know what it is I'm looking for. I just need some expert eyes on it. Sure. Victim's name is Miranda... Oh, uh, this is, um... An accident report. I know, but, um... McNeile blew the grid! My next door neighbor, McNeile. He overpowered his Christmas lights and blew my power. (sighs) 
 
 What's going on here? Riggs, uh, brought me a Christmas present! Hey, 'tis the season, right? Speaking of gifts, Bailey tracked down Elena Tull's purchase history. She just bought a wireless home security camera. She was recording Eddie. Yeah. And hopefully, that camera's still in the penthouse. Maybe Santa came early this year. Riggs, thanks for the... I got it. Thanks. Don't shoot. What the hell are you doing here? Elena borrowed something of mine. I needed to get it back. Oh, not so fast, not so fast. I need to see what's in the bag. I'm sorry, do you have a warrant? Murtaugh : We don't need one. You broke into a crime scene. (sighs) Do you know how many journalists have been killed by the Flores cartel? Over 400 in Juarez alone. They think they can silence us through intimidation. I'm not scared. With any luck, what's on this gonna put Eddie Flores away. Can I go now? Merry Christmas. (phone ringing) Yeah? Eddie : How you like the view from my apartment, Detective? Damn it, she took the SD card. It's Flores. Okay, you talk to him, I'm going after her. (door opens, closes) Eddie! What's up, buddy? What, did you call to confess? (laughs) My conscience is clean. I was thinking about our time in Texas. You were such a cowboy. What brought you out to L.A.? Ah, you know, smog, traffic. How 'bout you? Your uncle finally kick you out of Mexico? Eddie :  Nah, I came for the girls, man. Same as you. Your hot Chicana wife was from here, wasn't she? Mention my wife one more time. (car alarm chirps) You're such a hot head, Riggs. I'm just like you, though. I get angry and then... boom. I just explode. (car alarms wailing) The IED was triggered by a modified cell phone. It could have been detonated from anywhere by a text. Any way to figure out who was on the other end? It was a burner. Scorsese : Untraceable. He's playing with us. He called me to brag while we watched her burn. Scorsese, were you able to recover anything else from the victim? I found the SD card from Hannah's bag. It was badly damaged, but there was a cache of data. There's a password on it, though. It's up with Bailey now. Okay, so we get him with the video. How long's that gonna take? And what if it doesn't work? Even if it doesn't work, we will get him with something else. All right, Rog. We know exactly what he did. All of us know exactly what he did and where to find him, and we're not doing a damn thing about it. Okay, this is what he wants. He wants to get in our heads, make us go after him now, and make a mistake. What he's doing is he's laughing at us! He killed Elena, he killed Hannah, and he killed Miranda. And you know that how? Because it's what he's telling you. It's what he wants you to believe. Please tell him about the report! Report? What report? I gave Scorsese Miranda's accident report. So please tell him. Sorry, Riggs. There wasn't anything to indicate it wasn't an accident. What about the tox report? The driver wasn't drunk. There was nothing there. Hey, look, I know how hard this can be. No, you don't. Riggs, I need you to keep it together. Can you do that? I've been keeping it together, and look where that got me. Why don't you keep it together for the both of us. ♪ I see trees of green... ♪ (Trish chuckles) I hope RJ's not too disappointed with these headphones. He'll be fine.

I'm afraid he's gonna hurt somebody. I know I'm telling you something you probably already know, but you need to be there for him. I'm trying, believe me, but he's not having it. Hmm.

Grenade launcher? No. Better. Okay. (laughs) Does this mean that... Mm-hmm. You're gonna be a dad. (laughs) (sighs) Ah... I came to apologize. I need to be a little more understanding about... how hard this time of year is for you. Why don't you go home, Rog? Go be with your family. Is that gun for Flores? Don't go asking questions you don't want the answers to. Well, here's one I need answered. If you go and kill Flores in cold blood, what's left for you? What's left for me now? You really feel that way, then you need to go ahead and turn that thing on yourself. Look, Riggs... we don't know yet if Flores had anything to do with Miranda. The best way to find out is to arrest him for the murders of two women we  know  he killed. Once we have him, we can find out the rest. What if he pleads down, or walks? If we get him the right way, and he walks, I will help you find him. I'm not asking for your help, Roger. I know. You never do. But I know he killed her. So one way or another, it's either him or me. What are you still doing here? I thought you got a promotion so you can go home early. He's avoiding his in-laws. No, I'm closing a double homicide. So he doesn't have to commit one. But we did crack the password. You got video? Yeah, but it's not that great of quality. It's tough to ID who Elena's with. Aw, come on, that's Eddie. That's his clothes, the way he walks... it's him. Won't hold up in court. We need to see his face. Come on, turn around. I knew it. He's gonna walk. Play that again. Rog, it doesn't matter. You can't see his face. Play it. Wait, stop.

And quietly, okay? No sirens. I don't want the kids to hear about this. I'll take care of it. Hey. Bailey, thank you. Merry Christmas, Murtaugh. Trish : Roger? Is there anything else you want to tell me? No. I swear, I told you everything. And, look, baby, I promise you, you and the kids are safe now. Baby, I'm talking about that. (Murtaugh gasps) Prancer? Oh, my... How did Prancer get in here? How did Prancer get in here, honey? I do not know. Really? ROGER JR. (in distance): Dad! Come on. Oh... What? Dad... Dad, you bought me a freaking Ferrari? You actually bought him a car? That is so unfair! That's not yours. You know what's yours? This roof, this fam... that sister. Start appreciating what you have. What your father is trying to say is... we have each other. Right? Yeah. Trish : That's all we need. Come here. (Trish chuckles) We do still get gifts, though, right? (Trish laughs) ♪ Baby, please come home... ♪ FAA says Tito Flores' jet is gone. Somewhere in Mexican airspace. But the Murtaughs are safe. That's all we have for now. Probably a good time to... call it a night, head home. Yeah. Have a good night, Cap. ♪ Baby, please come home... ♪ You know, why don't you join us? If you don't have other plans. Oh, I got...

Go be with your family. ♪ All the fun we had last year... ♪ Riggs, I know you wanted Flores pretty bad. Did you at least get the answers you were looking for? Nah. He, uh... had me believing in things that don't exist. So... It is the time of year for that. ♪ Please come home... ♪ (Tito speaking Spanish) ♪ But it's not like Christmas at all ♪ 
♪ I remember when you were here ♪ 
♪ And all the fun we had last year... ♪ MURTAUGH (outside): Course he's here. Let me go first. There's no telling what he's been doing. May not be kid-safe. I've learned with Riggs, it's better to knock. Hello? You in there? (knocking on door) A peaceful family's outside. You decent? I'm drunk, if that's what you mean. Yeah. (door opens) I assumed that already. (Trish chuckles, Harper coughs) Hey, guys. Hey, Riggs. 'Sup? You guys didn't have to do this. This time of year isn't the same without family.
