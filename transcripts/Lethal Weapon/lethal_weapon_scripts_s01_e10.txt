 Murtaugh :  I keep asking, but I guess  the guy's got something better to do with his time. 
 Better than come over our house for dinner? 
 Yeah. I've got better things to do, and I still eat here. 
 This is what you do. 
 Tell Riggs  I  haven't seen him in a while, and  I'm  asking him over for dinner. 
 I'm not easily offended, but the guy's getting pricklier. 
 Oh, so you say. Every morning. 
 Not every morning. 
 Every morning. 
 Hon, clearly your partner is going through something right now, and it's starting to consume you. 
 And in the interest of talking about anything else over breakfast, get ahead of it. 
 Hey, there he goes. 
 (laughs) Any updates? 
 Nope. Not talking about it. 
 What? 
 Your son is sitting out his last winter high school dance because he hasn't asked a single girl out yet. 
 (laughs) RJ is fine. It's generational. 
 No one asks anyone to dances anymore. 
 That's not true. 
 I got asked last month, and it wasn't even my dance. 
 If it's anyone's business, I actually did ask someone. 
 Honey. 
 She never texted back, so... 
 Let's all just move on. 
 Oh, baby. 
 Murtaugh : You don't text someone and ask them to a dance. 
 You ask them. In person. 
 Like a human. 
 That's it. I'm out. 
 (chuckles) RJ. 
 I bet he used emojis. Rookie mistake. 
 (phone vibrating) 
 Uh. I got a dead body in Koreatown. 
 See? This is what texting is for. 
 Not asking a girl to a dance. What's wrong with him? 
 Hey, and don't forget to invite Riggs to dinner again! 
 (car horns blaring) 
 Murtaugh : "Generational" my ass. 
 As long as there's dances, there's gonna be kids who ask other kids to the dance. 
 So he's gonna need a little game. Am I wrong? 
 What? Who needs what? 
 You're kidding me. You didn't hear anything I just said? 
 Sorry, Rog. Just white noise. 
 (sighs) I don't get you, man. 
 We're supposed to be partners. 
 Hey. We  are  partners. 
 No. Partners listen. 
 They engage. 
 They pretend to care. 
 Let's try it. 
 Hey, partner, what did you do this weekend? 
 Nothing. 
 See, that's what I'm talking about. 
 Partners answer the question, Riggs. 
 I'm answering the question. 
 I did nothing. 
 You didn't go nowhere, do nothing, see nobody; you just sat in that little tin coffin, that's it? 
 Blinking and breathing. 
 Trish wanted me to invite you to dinner. 
 And considering your social calendar, I'm assuming you're available. 
 Can I think about it? 
 You're killing me. You're killing me. 
 Bailey :  Our D.O.A.'s name  is Adam Pressman... 26. 
 Business cards in his wallet says he was a party promoter. 
 This can't be good for business. 
 That's helpful. 
 Single bullet, close range. 
 Small caliber... I'm guessing .38. 
 So, what's with the fancy high-tech, uh... 
 Wireless headphones? 
 Yeah. 
 Came with the corpse. 
 (sighs) Huh. 
 Maybe he's from the future. 
 Maybe he hasn't been living under a rock for the past five years. 
 Look like the future's in here. 
 (people whooping, no music playing) 
 Is it not just me, but do you hear music? 
 That's evidence. 
 I know. It's not like I was gonna crush it up and snort it or anything. 
 LAPD! 
 The party's over! We're shutting this down! 
 They can't hear you. 
 I got the bass cranked up. 
 What is this? Some kind of a rave? 
 Rave? (chuckles) Cute. 
 It's a silent disco. 
 Oh. My favorite kind of disco. 
 You mind if I, uh...?

 Deejay : Everyone gets wireless headphones, and I beam the music directly into their brains. 
 Their brains altered on what? Ecstasy? 
 That's a perfectly legal supplement. 
 There's nothing illegal happening here. 
 Can I get back to what I was doing? 
 Do you know Adam Pressman? 
 Yeah. This is his event. Why? 
 Yeah, well, we need to shut it down. 
 Hey. Not bad. 
 Get your own music, your own drugs, nobody talks to you. 
 It's my kind of party. 
 (indistinct police radio chatter) 
 I don't know anyone that would want to hurt him. 
 I mean, everyone loved that guy. 
 Not everyone. 
 What about you two? 
 Were you more than just business partners? 
 We had a... partners with benefits sort of thing. 
 He was really one of a kind. 
 You see Adam leave the club with anyone last night? 
 No. 
 It was a total mob scene last night. 
 Word spread that Adam had a new supply of owls, and... 
 Owls? Like-like the birds? 
 Like the drug. Come on, partner. 
 Deejay : Legal chemical supplements. 
 They're named after Owlsly, the chemist who made them for Adam until they had a falling out. 
 I thought everybody loved him. What happened? 
 All I know is that, for a while, the supplements had dried up, and then last night, they started flowing again, and the crowd followed. 
 So, where can we find this chemist? 
 He got a lab somewhere? 
 Nobody knows. 
 Adam did, but he was one of the few. 
 Owlsly's... super underground. 
 Ah. What a great thing to be. 
 Thank you. 
 Scorsese :  Owlsly is an artist. 
 A Leonardo da Vinci of chemistry. 
 I thought you said you had autopsy results. 
 Oh, on this guy? 
 Simple gunshot wound. Open and shut. 
 I spent the rest of the morning analyzing that drug you brought back from the club. 
 And by "analyzing," you mean? 
 I broke it down to basic compounds, reverse-engineered it, and then I field-tested quite a few of them. 
 That's becoming clear. 
 Guys, I was blown away. 
 This isn't old-school MDMA. 
 The owl takes Molly and (exhales) packs her bag. 
 Good-bye. Sends her to college, 'cause this is... smooth. 
 Mind-expanding. 
 Is it legal? 
 And it fixed the third act of my screenplay. 
 What? 
 My guy has to be half-man, half-lizard, so when he's fighting the lizards, he is fighting himself. 
 Scorsese. 
 Does this say what I think it does? 
 The drug's legal? 
 Completely legal. Every single compound, diphenidine, ephedra, is elegantly altered just enough to stay on this side of the drug laws. 
 It's an exciting time to be alive! 
 You know what'd be really exciting? 
 If we can get an address for the da Vinci of drugs. 
 Looks like he's already on it. 
 He's been searching shipping manifests from chemical wholesalers. 
 Brilliant. Right? Want to know how I got the idea? 
 Eh, you know what? 
 You should put it in the script. 
 Oh, yeah. Okay. Yeah. Murtaugh, good note. 
 Yeah. Yeah! In the lizard's... 
 I mean, I'll have to translate it to lizard talk, but totally. 
 Yeah. 
 I mean, things... are good. 
 I mean, Roger's got a bug up his ass about how I spend my weekends. 
 But other than that, it's all good. 
 What you got there? 
 (mumbles): I don't know. 
 Chopped kale with mustard vinaigrette? 
 Damn. 
 Look, I saw it. I didn't... 
 There was no name on it or anything... 
 Well, no. There it is. 
 "M.C." Right there. 
 I'll-I'll write bigger next time. 
 Sorry. I-I didn't have breakfast or dinner the night before, or lunch, for that matter, so... 
 So, when you say you spent the weekend in the trailer, you actually... 
 I really don't see what the problem is. 
 In fact, I'm looking forward to next weekend. 
 Which is kind of the problem. 
 You see, when what you most look forward to in this world is your next opportunity to avoid it... 
 (sighs) 
 ...that can be an indicator of clinical depression. 
 You think I'm depressed? 
 It's a treatable condition. 
 Not interested. 
 In medication or in feeling better? 
 (phone vibrating) 
 Oop! Got to boogie. 
 And just when we were getting somewhere, Doc. 
 Want the rest of your salad? 
 I'm good. Enjoy. 
 (strains): Oh. All right. 
 Riggs :  Scorsese gave you this address? 
 Yeah. And yes, he may have field-tested one too many supplements when he gave it to me. 
 Smile, Rog. 
 Hello. LAPD. 
 We're here to speak to an "Owlsy..." 
 Why are you having so much trouble with that? 
 "Owsy." 
 Owlsly. 
 Owlsly. What-what? 
 (door buzzes) 
 You're just making noises. 
 Yeah, well, so is Owlsly. 
 Is that it? 
 (music playing in distance) 
 What do you want? 
 Uh, we're looking for Owlsly. 
 Uh, I don't know who that is. 
 I've never heard that name before. 
 Sorry. Can't help you. 
 Another question. 
 Could it be that you are Owlsly? 
 What are you looking at? 
 Riggs : Oh! Look at that. A bunch of owls. 
 Murtaugh : Owls. 
 Good observation. 
 Yes. Yes. Fine, whatever. I'm Owlsly. 
 We'd like to ask you a few questions. 
 (sighs) 
 It's not really for profit. 
 I see it as a public service, providing legal compounds to people who want their reality supplemented. 
 Better living through chemistry, right? 
 Something like that, yeah. 
 I got to finish something up. 
 Hey. 
 Between the hours of 8:00 and midnight, where were you last night? 
 Wait. Y-You think that I killed him? That's why you're here? 
 Uh, we just need to rule certain things out. 
 Fine. Between 8:00 and midnight, I was here. 
 Also, before 8:00, also, after midnight. 
 And you never left the house? 
 Not just yesterday. I don't go anywhere. 
 I haven't left this loft in three years. 
 Oh. 
 Nothing wrong with that. Right, Rog? 
 So, you don't even go to the parties to see the masses that you're medicating? 
 No need. Adam set up webcams. 
 If you have good Wi-Fi, it's just like being there. 
 No, it is not. 
 He's got a whole thing on this. Just continue. 
 There's a whole world out there. 
 Yeah, I've seen it. 
 And anything I want out there, I can get in here. 
 Food, books, plants, you name it. 
 Alcohol? 
 Oh, dude, there's a great app for that. 
 Really? 
 Yeah, no, it'll get to you in, like, 20 minutes. 
 Beer, whiskey, whatever? 
 (clears throat, mumbles) 
 Yeah, we heard from Jessica, the deejay, that you had a fight with Adam over something. 
 It was a business disagreement. 
 Adam was pushing to amp up production. 
 He was approached by a Koreatown gang that wanted to distribute the owls. 
 Said we could both get rich. 
 So, why'd you say no? 
 They didn't just approach Adam, they straight-up threatened him. 
 I saw it on the webcam. This one guy got right up in his face. He had a gun. It was scary. 
 I told Adam that if he wanted to go into business with him, fine, but I was out. 
 That's what the fight was about. 
 And now you're looking for the guy who killed him and you're starting with me? 
 Seriously? Find that guy. 
 So, you actually saw him getting threatened? 
 Clear as day. 
 Why? 
 Riggs :  Keep going.  You're doing great. 
 Seriously, how are these mug shots not online? 
 Scan them and e-mail them to me. 
 Sorry, but everything's down at the station. 
 Mug shots, sketch artists, database... 
 Double dose on beta blockers. 
 Getting spikes of anxiety, mild tachycardia. 
 Okay, look, we're just right down here. 
 I'm not gonna make it. 
 Riggs : Hey, guys, get on the ground. 
 Get on the ground! 
 (tires screeching) 
 Riggs : Hey, you okay? 
 You okay? 
 This is why I don't leave my loft. 
 Hypothesis proven. People suck. 
 What I'm saying is, Koreatown has both a rich complex history and unique political challenges. 
 That's what you've been saying, and saying. 
 (groans) 
 And, look, I could listen to you talk about redistricting all day long, but the blue Subaru that shot at us, it's not gonna track down itself, so if we could just... 
 Point is, I requested some help for you guys, and it just came through. 
 One of LAPD's real hidden assets. 
 Detective Henry Cho, meet Detectives... 
 Murtaugh and Riggs, in the flesh. 
 Damn. 
 I'm very thrilled to meet you guys. 
 So excited to get started. 
 Detective Cho is a true student of the Koreatown community. 
 With all due respect, Captain, uh, I just feel that bringing a third person into the... 
 I-I agree with Riggs. 
 It's... I-I mean, even two people is often one too many. 
 Well, not so much with that. 
 That's a little dig, but... 
 No offense. 
 None taken. 
 I'm very happy to find LAPD members who have educated themselves in cultural norms, K-Town gang structures, where to find the best barbeque on Normandie... 
 Well, yeah, maybe a couple hours won't hurt. 
 Riggs : Yeah, yeah. 
 Let's, uh... 
 No, you first. 
 No, you, please. 
 No, no, please. 
 Oh, okay. All right. Well, this is annoying. 
 If we could just all... 
 Bailey ran a DMV search, came up with nine Subaru owners with criminal ties. 
 Love it. Hit the ground running. 
 Also, sharp hat, Roger. 
 I mean it. 
 Thank you, Cho. Appreciate you noticing. 
 I'm with this guy all day long. 
 Not once has he ever complimented me on one of my hats. 
 What's up? 
 Oh, look at that. Did you just put that on? 
 I got a contact at a club on Western, Road to Sung's. 
 The place is known for two things: ginseng chicken soup and its clientele. 
 K-Town gang leaders love the place. 
 Perfect. So, we'll start with the chemist, see if she can I.D. the Subaru owner, and then we hit that Road to Sung's. 
 Sounds good to me. 
 All right. 
 Or... a different idea. 
 Why don't we split up? 
 Split up? 
 What do you mean? 
 Rog, we don't have to do everything together. 
 One of us can go to the club, one of us can talk to the witness, or... two of us can do one of those. I understand the concept. 
 The captain said we... 
 Added benefit: we get twice as much done. 
 I'm not 100% sure on that... it's math... but it sounds right. 
 Fine. We'll split up. 
 Fantastic. 
 But, hey, Riggs, we-we can meet up for lunch. 
 Or not. 
 Have fun! 
 Well, that's true. 
 We'll cover more ground. 
 Yeah, man, I understand the idea. 
 I-It's... it's how he expressed it. 
 I get that. 
 It's hurtful. 
 Yeah. Hurtful. 
 Owlsly :  What do you want? 
 I brought the photos to you this time. 
 So, uh, I notice the patrol cars downstairs were gone. 
 I sent it away. 
 You-You sent them away. How? 
 I e-mailed law firms that specialize in suing the LAPD till I found a junior partner willing to draft a letter. 
 Well, there's people that are trying to kill you, so if you'd like to stay alive, it might behoove... 
 What if I don't? 
 I swear to God, if you start talking about the glories of Machu Picchu or the smell of beignets at Jazz Fest, I've got compounds right here that are gonna knock me out for a day, a month or forever. 
 You know, I've been to Jazz Fest. 
 It's really just Mardi Gras for old people. 
 And beignets are just fat doughnuts, so... 
 It's a modified benzo. Chill. 
 My dad used to say that the only way to change the world was through chemistry. 
 I was gonna be the chemist to do it. 
 Yeah? What happened? 
 Why? You gonna fix me? 
 Uh, no, that's not in my skill set. 
 You brought it up. 
 Everything's data, right? 
 My dad falls asleep at the wheel. 
 Dies after dropping me off at USC. 
 Head of my research lab tells me he loves me, then publishes my research as his own, goes back to his wife. 
 Then, finally, when your business partner's murdered 'cause you don't want to make drugs for a Korean gangster, that's called inherently repeatable data. 
 Your theory's no longer a theory. 
 Help me find the man who killed your partner. 
 It's not gonna make the world a better place, but it might make you feel better. 
 Let me see. 
 Him. 
 That's the guy who threatened Adam. 
 Thomas Kang. 
 All right. 
 Thank you. 
 ♪ Na, na, na, oh, oh, oh... ♪ 
 (Korean pop song playing) 
 Mmm, mmm, mmm. 
 Why am I not eating this every week? 
 I've always thought lunch is the most important meal of the day. 
 Yes, it is. 
 But I've got a partner with the palate of a 12-year-old. 
 Canned cheese. 
 That's a delicacy to this guy. 
 (speaks Korean) 
 (both speak Korean) 
 (speaks Korean) 
 Roger. 
 Your contact is a doumi hostess. 
 Mm-hmm. 
 Do we have a problem here? 
 Oh, no, not... Please, sit. 
 No disrespect. 
 It's just, it was my understanding that the doumi culture was going away. 
 I read it in an article on the LAPD Web site. 
 You read that? 
 Yeah. 
 I wrote that. 
 You... What?! 
 Yeah, I wrote that. 
 Yes? It was amazing. 
 Guys. 
 I know, it's... 
 The meter is running. 
 An hour to talk or karaoke with. 
 What we need is information on who might be involved in a turf war over club drugs. 
 A party promoter was shot down yesterday. 
 Near Seventh Street? 
 Yeah. That's the one. 
 The guy you're looking for is in the lounge next to the bar. 
 Okay. 
 (women laughing) 
 We got three guys, at least two guns. 
 I'm thinking the move is... 
 Wait for backup. 
 Wait for backup. 
 Yeah, this is protocol. 
 There's a risk of collateral damage. 
 Plus, I already called it in. 
 Did I overstep? 
 No. It makes sense. 
 We never wait for backup. Riggs hates waiting for backup. 
 Oh, that's so counterintuitive. 
 Yes. 
 Now, shouldn't we have heard from Riggs? 
 Of course we should've. 
 I text him that we found our guy, like, three times. 
 Oh. It's like he refuses to text me back. 
 That's not okay. 
 No. 
 This is a two-way street. 
 Two ways. 
 A partnership is a... 
 (whispers): Wait, hold on. No, no. 
 Put it behind you, put it behind you. 
 Okay, so, Owlsly I.D.'d Kang as our guy, so we should be good to go. 
 
 
 
 Murtaugh : Would've been nice to read that in a text. 
 You know, the same way that I text you that he was here. 
 You don't like the pork skin in the sweet and sour? 
 Okay, this is cute, but can we just get to it? Where is he? 
 Lounge three. 
 But we're waiting for backup. 
 Since when do we wait for backup? 
 Since now. Since it's protocol. 
 Mm-hmm. And-and since there's a risk of collateral damage. 
 That's right. 
 Riggs : Okay, how about the risk of losing our guy? 
 Or the fact that we never wait for backup? 
 Murtaugh : Why are you including him? 
 There's... Guys! Shooter! 
 Riggs : Oh, everybody down! 
 (people screaming) 
 (women screaming, sobbing) 
 Oh, great. 
 Congratulations. 
 You lost Kang. 
 You  lost Kang. 
 See, that is exactly what someone who lost Kang would say. 
 Hey, why don't you call me when backup gets here? 
 It's a two-way street, Riggs! 
 Yup! 
 Two ways! 
 I want to calm down, but I can't. 
 It's his behavior, his pathological refusal to communicate! 
 Breathe. Sit and breathe. 
 The guy you shot, Kang's pal, we got his phone. 
 Bailey and Cho are working on it. 
 The day wasn't a total loss. 
 The problem is bigger than just today. 
 I mean, maybe he's not built to be a partner. 
 I mean, you can't just blindly roll the dice... 
 It wasn't a blind roll of the dice. 
 I could've put Riggs with anyone; I chose you. 
 Why? 
 Do you remember our first couple of weeks? 
 The crap that I was going through when they put us together? 
 Man, you were a picnic compared to this dude. 
 I was a mess. 
 My confidence was shot. 
 I'd been in a car with Jenkins for six months. 
 (snickers) Jenkins. 
 The homophobic Swede. 
 And that's what he called himself. 
 (both chuckle) 
 Do you know what a centerboard is? 
 Centerboard? Mm. 
 It's a part of the sailboat that you can't see. 
 But it keeps the boat upright and allows it to be steered. 
 That's you, my friend. 
 It's why I put you with Riggs. 
 It wasn't an accident. 
 (sighs) 
 Cahill : Grocery shopping for next weekend? 
 (grunts) 
 I heard about Koreatown. 
 Yeah, you and the rest of the building. 
 Your partner does have a voice that carries. 
 Maybe he needs some of those weekly sessions with you. 
 Deal with his anger issues. 
 You think Roger has anger issues? 
 What, you don't? 
 The man's angry about everything. 
 He's furious about how I spend my weekends. 
 Maybe that's not so much anger as it is fear. 
 Fear of what? 
 Educated guess? 
 Knowing that he's your one connection to the outside world. 
 I mean, that would scare the crap out of anyone. 
 How's that my problem? 
 Riggs, don't burn your one bridge out of wherever it is you are. 
 (knocking on door) 
 Trish :  Roger, can you get that? 
 Riggs. 
 Hey. 
 What are you doing here? 
 Wait. I thought dinner was tonight. 
 You don't want me here now? 
 No, the point is you don't want to be here. Trust me. 
 I didn't know you were gonna be here. 
 Roger thought you might not come. 
 So, okay, I want you to meet a friend of mine, Kate. 
 Hi. This is Martin. Martin, Kate. 
 Hi. 
 Hi, Kate. 
 Nice to meet you. 
 So, I-I hope everybody brought their appetites. 
 Oh, yes. 
 All right, come on. 
 (Trish laughs) 
 Kate : And the two of us are stuck doing discovery in a warehouse in Sylmar for a week. 
 (laughs) No air conditioning. 
 Mid-August. 
 I must've lost, I don't know, five pounds. 
 Matter of fact, I'm thinking about going back there next summer. 
 (laughs) 
 (both mouthing) 
 So, you're new to L.A.? 
 Yeah. 
 How are you spending your downtime? 
 I'm always looking for tips. 
 Um... 
 I don't really have any tips. 
 Of course you got tips. 
 Tell her how you spent your weekend. 
 I, um... (clears throat) kind of tuned out this past weekend. 
 You know, I had a little sabbatical with myself. 
 I think that's great. 
 It's healthy. There are studies that talk about how we need alone time to recharge. 
 It is healthy, isn't it? 
 You know what? Maybe Roger would love to take a look at some of those studies. Send them over to him. 
 Murtaugh : You know what's interesting about Riggs? 
 Is he can be on a sabbatical, even when he's with someone. 
 Well, it's just easier with some than others, you know? 
 Yeah. Well, you know when he's really on a sabbatical? 
 Is when you're trying to text him. 
 Oh, he's never healthier. 
 Oh, wow. 
 So now we're gonna bring up my phone etiquette? - It's terrible. 
 It's terrible? So what would you like me to do? 
 Maybe send a little smiley face and a bunch more emojis? 
 Trish : Guys, okay. 
 Enough. Oh, yeah, give me a little hello... 
 Enough! 
 Enough. 
 I told you this wouldn't work. 
 (sighs) 
 That's what this is? 
 You guys playing matchmaker? 
 I'm sorry, Kate, this must be a little, um... 
 Little bit. 
 Excuse me. 
 Thank you, Trish. 
 Uh...

 Hey. 
 It's Bailey. 
 Go, Bailey. 
 I pulled the last 12 hours of text off the phone. 
 You need to hear the most recent. 
 I'm putting Cho on now. 
 I'm translating from the Korean, but it's pretty straightforward. 
 It says, "I'm done waiting. 
 Get to the deejay and chemist tonight." 
 It was sent just before noon today. 
 Okay. 
 All right, I'm going to get Owlsly. 
 Cho, we're gonna get the deejay. 
 Baby, I'm sorry about... 
 Consider it a mercy killing.

 No idea. Whatever they could find. 
 You'll be happy to know I'm taking your advice, getting out.

 So, you were saying there were two men? 
 One had a gun. 
 They forced me into the hallway and started yelling, "Where's the money?" 
 No one even noticed. 
 What money? 
 They said they gave Adam half a million dollars and they wanted it back. 
 A half million. 
 Was that true? 
 If it was, I never heard about it. 
 But they didn't believe me. 
 They just kept hitting me and yelling, did I have it, did Owlsly have it. 
 I told them I don't even know who Owlsly is. 
 So, you lied to them, like you lied to us. 
 I didn't... I didn't lie to you. 
 Well, if you don't know who Owlsly is, then why is she on your Instagram page? 
 Her? 
 No, that's not. 
 That's what's-her-name. 
 That's Olive something from-from our freshmen hall. 
 Was just some weirdo that had a crush on Adam. 
 You and Adam were close. 
 We were business partners. 
 I told you. 
 You didn't tell me you were in love with him. 
 Because the feeling wasn't mutual. 
 Come on, Owlsly. 
 You're not telling me everything. 
 He told me he had been in love with me since college, and I bought it. 
 Adam could talk anyone into anything. 
 Talked Kang out of half a million dollars. 
 Talked you into making pills for him. 
 He said we'd start a life together. 
 I thought, for one brief moment, (distorted): I was gonna be a part of the world again. 
 But I was wrong. 
 He was still sleeping with Jessica. 
 I killed him because he made me feel stupid. 
 I dropped my guard. 
 I let him in. 
 I'm gonna need you to put that bag down. 
 (distorted): No problem. 
 You should sit down, though. 
 You should, um... 
 How'd you do that? 
 Transdermal from contact. 
 The hug? 
 It's just gonna slow you down. 
 Nothing permanent. 
 I'm sorry. I... I just, I needed a head start. 
 No, no, no, no, don't try to move. 
 Don't fight it. 
 Just enjoy the ride.

 He still won't pick up his phone.

 (slurring): I mean, Kang didn't kill Owlsly. 
 I mean, Ow... 
 Kang didn't kill Adam. 
 Owlsly did. 
 She killed him and took Kang's money. 
 And then she drugged me. 
 What? 
 What, did you know this already? 
 What, 'cause I told you? 
 Yeah. 
 Twice.

 Hey, boss, they're back. 
 Punch it, Rog! 
 Whoa! 
 All right, hey, look, get me close enough so I can shoot out their tires. 
 Put that weapon down! 
 Hey, you don't tell me what to do. 
 You're in no condition to shoot a gun! 
 I'm a Navy SEAL; I can do whatever I want to do.

 Okay, there's glass in the hole. I...

 Not bad, I don't think.

 EMTs should be here shortly. 
 They can take a look at you. 
 You know I got to take you in, right? 
 You won't.

 Nope.

 I already took them.

 Why would you do this? 
 Like you don't know? 
 I'm sorry about Adam. 
 I just keep making the same mistake. 
 I keep forgetting how much this place sucks.

 No, it's lovely. Thank you for the wine.

 You know, not being sociable with your friend.

 Nothing.

 What?! 
 Three different girls? 
 Three?!

 They were all a part of this big crowd that saw him get shot down by Lindsay. 
 And-and they felt sorry for him. That's good. 
 That's good strategy. 
 No, they were impressed. 
 They said that they'd never... 
 Never seen a guy ask a girl out in person. Yeah.

 Didn't I say that? What did I tell you?

 You're welcome, Dad. 
 So which one you gonna pick? 
 You don't get to weigh in on this one. 
 Look, this is what you got to do.

 You got to learn to put a little bass in your voice.
