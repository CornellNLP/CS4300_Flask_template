 Hello. Look... 
 I'm not one to, you know, put the brakes on a party, but, uh, well, it's early and, uh, you guys can't play or sing, so... 
 Man : Too early? 
 No way, man. 
 It is never too early to rock. 
 Super fun!

 Right. This is my wolves. 
 Uh, amazing. 
 Uh... well, as you can tell, uh... this part of the beach is taken. 
 So, maybe we could... you know, rock up the coast. 
 This is a public beach lot, no?

 We are from Amsterdam, here to R-O-C-K in the U.S.A.

 Rj : Oh, what? Do we not look prepared? 
 Why did we need a new TV anyway? 
 TV? No, TV is what we used to have. 
 This is a state-of-the-art, fully integrated entertainment network. 
 (Trish laughs) 
 It's adorable how you think you're gonna remember how all this works tomorrow. 
 Okay, Mr. Murtaugh. 
 From this you can control the entire system. 
 Mm. Uh-huh. 
 And while I had access, I updated the OS on your wireless devices and networked your photo libraries. 
 Awesome. 
 So, I just press that? 
 Mm-hmm. 
 Hey! Look, honey, the Murtaughs! 
 (chuckles) 
 We look like we should have our own reality show. 
 Look how photogenic this family is. 
 Very. 
 Look at that smile. 
 Oh, my goodness. 
 (chuckles) 
 Very photogenic. 
 Dad! 
 Roger! 
 Oh! 
 Hey, hey, hey! 
 What did you do?! Fix that. 
 What happened? 
 What?! No! 
 Dad! Now it's bigger. 
 Trish : Come on. 
 Murtaugh : Hey, damn it. 
 Close your eyes! What'd you do? 
 You know what? Get out of my house. 
 Trish : Just... 
 Stumble... your ass out! 
 What are you... 
 It-It-It's a picture. 
 I just... 
 A picture?! 
 I just wanted to, you know, see how I looked. 
 Then why'd you text it? 
 Give me that! Riana. 
 You texted?! 
 You text that to someone?! 
 I want the name and a number. Now! 
 What? 
 What? No way. 
 Riana... Riana! 
 Uh, no, no, Roger, calm down. 
 Are you... okay with this?! 
 No, but I don't want her to be ashamed of her body, either. 
 Why not? 
 I'm comfortable with that. 
 Which is why I will be the one to talk to her... after she calms down. 
 You think this is funny? 
 No, I-I don't. 
 Which is why I memorized the number where she sent that photo to. 
 Strong. 
 (laughing): Kids, right? 
 ♪ ♪ 
 Murtaugh : How old is she? 
 Bailey : 19. Nina Clausen. 
 Found half-naked and dead on a hood of a Ferrari, wrecked on a residential street in Beverly Hills. 
 Driver was MIA. 
 Scorsese : From the cuts on her feet, I'd say she covered a good distance. 
 She was running from somebody, wasn't she? 
 What is it? That's not asphalt. 
 What is that on her feet? 
 Don't know yet. 
 Sent it to the lab. 
 I mean, where's she from? 
 Does she go to school? 
 As far as I can tell, she moved from North Carolina to L.A. about six months ago. 
 Has some modeling and acting credits. 
 Murtaugh : That's the same girl? 
 She looks closer to 17. 
 Riggs : Who's the vehicle registered to? 
 No registered owner or plate, just a license frame from a place called Prime Exotics. 
 Hey, Bail. 
 I'm gonna send you a phone number. 
 I need you to get me whatever you can on whoever it is. 
 It's not about the case; it's personal. 
 The city of dreams, huh? 
 (rap song playing) 
 Man, how small does your pen1s need to be to buy one of these cars? 
 Gentlemen, welcome to Prime Exotics, where car dreams become reality. 
 I own one of these bad boys myself. 
 Wonderful. 
 My partner has a question for you. 
 Yeah, ask me anything. 
 Joseph O'Brien, head of sales. 
 Are these cars absolutely perfect for Los Angeles or what? 
 Yeah... listen, I'm LAPD. 
 I need some information on one of your customers. 
 Someone who bought a red F355. 
 Riggs : Uh, a little help here? 
 ♪ ♪ 
 (car beeps) 
 Ah! 
 Fancy! 
 How much for this one right here? 
 It's, uh, $210,000. 
 Make it 205 and I'll take it off your hands today. 
 Oh, wait a minute. 
 No cup holder. 
 Red F355. 
 Who bought it? 
 Look, I'd love to help you guys out here, but our customers... uh... they value discretion. 
 This is a murder investigation, so I suggest you tell me what I need to know so you can get back to your little tanning bed. 
 Riggs : Uh, Joseph, do not listen to him. 
 You are bronzed, beautiful... 
 (clucks tongue) ...and powerful. 
 Hey, Joey. 
 Let's go for a test ride. 
 (Murtaugh laughs) 
 I wouldn't do that if I was you. 
 Ah, come on, Joey! 
 Be somebody. Sell a car today, my man. 
 Joseph :  What-What-What are you doing? 
 Slow down! 
 Ah, I'm sorry. I am in a mood. 
 Had a rough morning. 
 I got new neighbors, Dutch accents,  but then there's you, Joe.

(car horn beeping) (Joseph screams) Okay, okay! It was Dylan Ashworth! There it is. He's insane. Riggs : So, I got the name. Dylan Ashworth. So did I... from Rick here. And all I had to do was ask. Well, thank you, Rick... for everything. You know, I love this town... sometimes. Are you two aware that Dylan Ashworth is Henry Ashworth's son? And Sheldon and Dorothy Ashworth's grandson, yeah, we get it. Uh, I have no idea who these people are. Have you ever driven on Ashworth Boulevard? Or been to Ashworth Pavilion? You know, I don't frequent pavilions, not as much as I should, and I know that I'm missing out, but I... You ever heard of Ashworth, California? What, do they got their own city? It's where the family struck gold, literally, back in 1849. They've been California royalty ever since. That doesn't make them above the law. No, but they do keep an entire law firm on retainer. Well, good. If this Dylan kid murdered our girl then he's gonna need it. Let's go have a chat with him. Agreed, but just talk to him. The Ashworths are formidable. Keep it completely professional, respectful even. Why are you just looking at me? Because you are the only one that I am talking to. ♪ ♪

Be careful, though, a couple of drinks and it gets kind of crazy. That's my kind of mustache. (chuckles) Can I get it, or you, a drink? Or anything else? Anything? Mm-hmm. That doesn't really narrow it down, now does it? That's the idea at these parties. Ah, who's idea is that? Dylan? Well, it's Dylan's place, but it's Julian's party. Rachel? ♪ Get, get, get... ♪ Excuse me. ♪ Get, get, get, get low ♪ 
♪ When the whistle blow... ♪ Mr. Ashworth. Who are you? Detective Roger Murtaugh, LAPD. What, are you part of the security detail for the party? Talk to Julian. He handles all that. No, I'm here investigating a homicide. Young lady named Ms. Nina Clausen. Does that name ring a bell? Nope. Was she hot? She was found dead on the hood of a wrecked Ferrari that you bought about six weeks ago. Is the car okay? (Dylan chuckles) I think it would be in your best interest if we went somewhere where we could talk about this very sensitive matter in private. All right. (groaning) You're under arrest for possession of narcotics. Come on. Let me go! Damn it! Get your ass in there. Are you kidding me?! Riggs : Rachel! Do you have any idea who you're messing with? I do. Detective Riggs, meet Dylan Ashworth. Now he does, too. Hey. Hmm? You all right? I just saw somebody I knew. Doesn't seem like this is your kind of scene. No, it was a friend of Miranda's Her old roommate. I'll have both your badges. Both : Shut up! Get out of here. Hi, everyone. Rachel. Uh, I hate giving speeches, but there is one story I'd like to tell. So Miranda and I were living together when she booked a job in Texas. And I get a phone call from her, and she says that she's gonna be staying a little longer 'cause she met a guy... (chuckles) ...and could I send her some clothes? I said, "Sure. What do you need?" And she said, "Cowboy boots." (scattered laughter) I knew in that moment that I lost her forever. Um, Martin, I don't know what you did or how you did it...

Oh, he's amazing. Really amazing, yeah. May I? Yeah, okay. Play it, man. Thank you. (tuning) (exclaiming) Dutch, drunk, and stupid is no way to go through life, boys. Enjoy the rest of your day. You know, you nearly gave your dad another heart attack yesterday. Come on, Mom, it's no big deal. Riana, you don't want pictures like that floating around the Internet. It's not like I was naked. It's not like you were shouting "respect me" either. Sharing your body, Riana, even in a picture, is a big deal. So what, I should just wear a turtleneck every day? I'm not talking about t your clothes, honey. I'm talking about your choices. If you don't respect your body, boys won't either. I'm just asking for you to be smart and think beyond this moment. I think what we're talking about here is personal responsibility. Have you guys talked about the male gaze? Can you see my gaze? Yeah. Yeah, I see it. Uh-huh. Keep it moving. Murtaugh :  You're telling me  you never met Nina Clausen before? That she'd never attended one of your house parties? No clue. I meet a lot of people and have a lot of parties. She was found dead on the hood of your car, Dylan! And like I told you, it was stolen. When? Not sure. I was busy. Doing what with who? "Whom." There were a few of them. Don't remember their names. I'd need to see pictures of them. Naked would make it easier. (door opens) Don't say anything else, Dylan. Detective Murtaugh, I'm the Ashworth family's attorney. This is over right now. As I understand it, Detective, you entered Dylan's house without a warrant. I heard a disturbance... Please, Detective, excuse my attorney's tone. From what I understand, there's enough blame to go around in this matter, the lion's share of it falling squarely on my son. But in light of the circumstances, at this point we view this as a family matter. Captain... I appreciate your cooperation, Captain. And you have my apologies for the confusion. Is someone confused about something here? That's enough, Detective. What the hell were you thinking, Roger? You may have just jeopardized any case we try to make against the kid on this. That punk pulled out a vial of coke  after  I told him I was a cop. That's why you brought him in, for possession? You see that girl in the morgue? That's why I brought him in. Dylan, all his friends at the party, they all think that they're untouchable. And he'll remain that way unless you and Riggs can find some solid evidence. Where is Riggs, anyway? He's running down a lead. He said he wanted to go alone. God help us. Martin? Is that you? Oh, my God, it is you. Hi. Hey, Rachel, yeah. Good to see you. How are you? It's been a while. Well, since yesterday at the party. Party? What are you talking about? Come on, Rach. Yesterday, Dylan Ashworth's house. I saw you, you saw me. No, sorry, you must be confused. Here's the deal, Rach. I'm investigating a homicide. 19-year-old Nina Clausen. I think Ashworth's involved. Maybe we should talk inside. (Riggs clears throat quietly) So... So why'd you run away from me yesterday? (sighs) I don't know. I just... that party... those people. I didn't want you to think I was a part of that scene. Why were you there? I was invited by the guy who hosted the party. Julian? Yeah. How are you, Martin? Oh, hanging in there. Good. I assumed you'd be back in Texas. Oh, no, I couldn't stay there, so, you know, I came out here, got a little place down at the beach. Down by the cove? So look, if I, uh... if I wanted to find this Julian guy, where would I look? I heard he hangs out at the Amal Hotel. Okay. Thanks a lot. Hey... we should get together sometime, catch up. Sure. Look, um, stay away from Julian... and Ashworth. Okay? ♪ ♪ So when you say connecting people to the truth... Julian : The truth... The truth of what they want. What they really want. What they think they can't have. The forbidden fruit. But forbidden by whom? Pleasure, pain, adrenaline, anything. You tell me, and I will get it for you. Oh, feel rest assured should any complications arise, I will make them go away. Julian : Excuse me. When you're ready. Man, just hearing his sales pitch makes me want to take a shower. Makes me want to do something. I think he's connecting with someone right now. All right, give me the keys, I'm gonna follow him. You go with the girl. Look, if you find anything to charge him with, call me. Not a scratch, Riggs. Yeah, just... Yeah. 
 
 Sir? $14 for a club soda? You guys smoking crack? I should have bought the crack, it's cheaper. (siren whooping) I'm sorry, did I do something wrong, Officer? Uh, Detective. You know, I haven't written a traffic summons in I don't know how long. But when I noticed that you had... a broken side mirror, I just couldn't help myself, right, because broken mirrors just drive me crazy. Well, a more accurate assessment would be "drive me crazier." So why don't you... why don't you get out of the car? Let's go, let's go, let's go. There we are. There we are. (whipping, moaning) Oh... what is that? That's private. No, no, no. California statute 1249... or better known as the "five-second rule." Once something falls on the ground, it becomes public knowledge. What do we got here? Names and addresses and phone numbers, oh, my. (whipping) Police! Freeze! Drop it. You're under arrest for solicitation. We're not having s*x, this is a flogging session. A what? One I pay good money for. He's gonna do my nails afterwards. And I haven't got all day, so one of you better pick up that whip. Pick up the whip. (cell phone ringing) Oh, hey, Rog. I'm here with our good buddy Julian. He's a real dick, but he smells incredible. Yeah? Well, cut him loose. We have nothing. You know the truth I wanna be connected with? Who killed Nina Clausen? I don't know who that is, Detective. I'd get that side mirror fixed, because I promise you you do not want me pulling you over again. Hmm. Murtaugh. Hmm? I got that information for you. The number on your daughter's boyfriend. Belongs to a Chauncey Perkins, a surfing instructor who goes by the name of C-Dawg. C-Dawg? He's 19... He's 19?! ...and he has three priors for pickpocketing. He's got a  record? Is there anything else? Yes. I'm gonna need you to do your best to just remain calm. Check out his Facebook page. Hey! Yeah? Are you available? For what?

And you just... what? Just happened to be there? What are you getting at, Martin? This is Julian's. It's full of the names of all of his clients, and the names of the girls that are paid to hook up with 'em. Guess whose name's in here? Give me the book. All of these names are coded. How did you even know I was... You didn't. Look, I'm not judging you. You're not judging me? Are you kidding? You should see your face. You totally manipulated me. No, get out. Look, I am sorry. All right, I know how hard this is for you. All right, it's not easy for me either. Look, you were Miranda's friend... Yes, I was! You were not the only person who lost her. Look, Rachel, this is not about us! They killed someone! So I need to understand what's in this book. Are you gonna help me or not? Julian comes up with the nicknames. He picks something that reminds him of the person. What's yours? Madison. Because I'm from Wisconsin. I don't know the names of anyone else. Thank you. If I can figure out the code of Dylan Ashworth, I can prove that he was with Nina the night she was killed. He wasn't. How do you know? Because he was with me. All night. (sniffling) (voice breaking): Just leave. Please? (sniffles) (door closes) (dog barking in distance) (knocking at door) Hello, sugar. I am so sorry I didn't call, but surprises are fun, right?

Thanks, but I'm not really in the mood for a party. Sure you are. Scorsese : Detective, you came. Only because you said you had something to show me. Look, I get it. This place creeps you out. It's not just the place. Ouch. So, what you got? The lab results came back on the substance on Nina Clausen's feet. Tree sap. From a Red Dawn Full Moon Japanese Maple. Are you making that name up? No. Very rare. I ran a search on any murders in which victims were found with similar sap. Three turned up. All unsolved. All women, all with bruising on their wrists. Wow. That's impressive. Fin. That's "the end." In-in French. You know, genius is rarely understood at first blush. (elevator bell dings) Damn, so there's four victims? Yeah. Okay, get me whatever you can on each one of the cases. I got you. Oh, my God. Hey, baby! What brings you to the office? Chauncey Perkins. Please tell me you didn't... It wasn't my idea, it was Riggs' idea. I just wanted to scare him, just rough him up a... Rough him up? He's 19, Roger! Murtaugh : Exactly! Technically, he's an adult. A 19-year-old who you threatened into committing a crime! Murtaugh : It was a misdemeanor, not a felony. Do you know he goes by the name of C-Dawg? His parents called me. (scoffs): Snitch. And he broke up with Ri. And mind you, she is less upset about him than she is ashamed of her father. But he really broke up with her? Roger... Do you know that he posted her picture...  the  picture... on his Facebook page? He did? Uh-huh. And when I told him I'm Riana's dad, he said, "Which Riana?" Followed by, "I got a few." As  if  he's got a whole posse of girls named... Okay, listen. I get it. I'm gonna have a little chat with C-Dawg. Don't wait up for me. It's okay, Trish, I already handled it. "I got a few." That's what he said? Yeah. Hell to the no! Hey Trish, don't go do nothing that I have to arrest you for. Not that I would ever arrest you. You go ahead and commit crime at will, baby. Bailey, what are you working on? A lead on the Clausen case. The names in this book are all in code. Like "Madison" for a girl from Wisconsin. Dylan Ashworth... "Enzo," for his cars. So Dylan Ashworth is in there? Can you link him to Nina Clausen? No. He was with another girl that night. But I do think Nina is in here. This girl's last entry in the book was the night of Nina's murder. Name is Charlotte. Wasn't Nina from North Carolina? Yeah, but the codename of the guy that she was with is "Montana." Okay, so "Montana." So, he's from Billings, Bozeman... Or it could be anywhere else. Big Sky, Yellowstone... Hannah? Hannah Montana. Joking. Or Joe Montana. The quarterback? I know who Joe Montana is. He played for the 49ers. Named for the Gold Rush. The Ashworths were the original 49ers. But Nina wasn't with Dylan that night. So what if Montana is another Ashworth? The father, Henry? It's possible. Julian could have supplied him with the girls and he would have access to his son's Ferrari. Scorsese : As well as his own oil fields. Captain. Bailey. In an effort to impress that will, no doubt, go unnoticed, I looked into the other dead women. One body was on land owned by an Ashworth oil subsidiary. And this... is the Ashworth estate in Bel-Air. Note the front of the house. Specifically, the trees. Red Dawn Full Moon Japanese Maples. What does that mean? It means Henry Ashworth is probably our killer. ♪ My old friend ♪
