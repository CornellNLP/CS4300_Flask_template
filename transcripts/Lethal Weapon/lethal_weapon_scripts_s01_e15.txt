 ("Careless Whisper" by George Michael playing) 
 (door opens, bell jingles) 
 Hey. 
 Thanks for coming out. I know this is a little bit out of the way, but I am, uh, finally one punch away from a free cruller, so... 
 What is this? 
 This is my frequent holer card. I've been a member since 2008. 
 It's a great program. You just... 
 I mean, why are you here? 
 Ah. I am here to negotiate for my client's testimony. 
 I am Flaco Ruiz's new legal counsel, Leo Getz. 
 You can keep that. 
 Now, we are asking the DEA for... immunity, witness relocation in the city of his choosing-- nowhere smoggy, he's legitimately bronchial-- a one million dollar relocation bonus, and coverage of his legal fees, which are substantial. 
 This is not a negotiation. 
 Well, everything is a negotiation. 
 Shall we say $500,000 and coverage of his legal fees? 
 $100,000 and he will live in Fresno? 
 The DEA is prepared to offer one thing. 
 Coverage of his legal fees-- sold. 
 Protection from having his fingers hacked off and shoved into his mouth by the cartel. 
 (whispering) 
 Throw in a dozen crullers, and you got a deal. 
 Half of those are mine. My fee. 
 Now, if you gentlemen will excuse me, I need to see a judge about a release. Huh? 
 Should have made it two dozen crullers. 
 Agent : Get down! Get down! 
 (automatic gunfire, Leo screams) 
 (gasping) 
 (gunfire stops) 
 (motorcycles driving off, tires screeching) 
 (stammers) 
 (gasps) 
 (panting) 
 (bells jingle) 
 Murtaugh :  Big day, big breakfast. 
 My woman makes managing partner. 
 I hope you're hungry. 
 Do I look hungry? 
 Damn. Maybe not for breakfast. 
 (giggles) 
 That is the idea. 
 Hmm? 
 It's so beautiful, thank you. 
 The-- And the bow and everything, honey? 
 But I have to head over to the office to get some stuff done before the partners announce the promotion. I'm sorry. 
 Hey... it's okay. You know what? 
 I'll, uh, I'll just enjoy it all in your honor. 
 You can eat the bacon, baby. 
 I have a new plan to lower your cholesterol. 
 Well, if it involves eating pork, you have my attention. 
 No, it does not involve eating pork. 
 We  are putting in a pool with a resistance training feature. 
 Isn't that a... little pricey? 
 We can afford it now, baby. 
 Hey, Trish, why don't, why don't, why don't we just put the bonus money into our retirement fund? 
 Or we could put it into the college... 
 Baby, I'm gonna ask you to do something for me that goes against every fiber of your being. 
 (whispers): Don't worry so much. 
 Me, worry? 
 Not possible. 
 (laughs) 
 I love you. 
 You enjoy today. You earned it. 
 Scorsese : Morning, gentlemen. 
 Scorsizzle. What do we got? 
 Three dead by gunfire, approximately 5:00 a.m., including DEA agent Daniel Zigman. 
 The pattern and volume of brass from the ground suggests a nine-millimeter submachine gun. 
 Tire treads indicate two shooters, motorcycles. 
 Think the agent was the target? 
 I don't think so. 
 Trajectories point to this man. 
 Flaco Ruiz. 
 Where's DEA on all this? 
 Palmer : Right here. 
 Scorsese, Murtaugh. 
 Riggs. 
 Of all the donut shops in L.A., you had to walk into mine. 
 You look different. 
 He's got a new shirt. 
 No. 
 Oh. Oh, no? Well, I kind of cleaned up around... 
 It's your eyes. 
 They're white. 
 Sobriety becomes you. 
 (camera clicks) 
 Okay, so, Agent Palmer, what can you tell us? 
 Well, the deceased, Flaco Ruiz, had come to us with information about the cartel. 
 Agent Zigman scheduled an appointment with him to discuss terms. 
 I was supposed to be there and got called away, last minute. 
 Lucky day. 
 For some. 
 Scorsese : Now, it seems there was someone else at the scene. 
 Those footprints-- the pointed tips, six oval bands-- from what I can gather, I'd say size nine Ferragamos. 
 Ferragamos, really? 
 I know a thing or two about shoes. 
 Has anyone followed the footprints? 
 Come on. 
 (sirens whooping) 
 Just go. 
 Please. 
 Just... (sighs) 
 Quite a bit of tension between those two. 
 Not un-sexual. 
 You think? 
 Hey, can I talk to you for a second? 
 What do you know about the trajectory... 
 Footprints trailed off. 
 Whoever it was jumped in a vehicle. 
 Yeah. Security camera system was down. 
 Hey. 
 It's nice to see you playing so well with others. 
 What's that supposed to mean? 
 Come on, Riggs. Nobody wants to go through life alone. 
 You know, the right girl could catch your eye. 
 Like her? 
 If that's your speed, I'm not gonna judge. 
 Excuse me, ma'am? 
 Leave me alone! 
 Whoa, whoa, wait, wait, wait. Ma'am. 
 Get the hell away from me! 
 Did you happen to see the shooting across the street? 
 No, I ducked when I heard shots. 
 But I saw the guy. 
 You saw the shooter? 
 No, the weasel. 
 He was running away. 
 So he was a little man? 
 No, a real weasel. 
 Okay, what, uh, particular kind of weasel are we talking? 
 We talking short-tailed, long-tail? 
 (grunts) 
 That kind of weasel. 
 There! The bus! 
 Shooter's on the bus? 
 He's on the bus! 
 He's on the bus. 
 Huh. She's right. 
 A real weasel. 
 Avery : Who the hell is Leo Getz? 
 Murtaugh : Some lowlife lawyer. 
 Isn't that a little, uh, redundant, Rog? 
 I-I mean, not-- you know, your wi... 
 I mean, because Trish is an outstanding lady. 
 First class, right? 
 And... and she gave me this shirt. 
 Impressive. Only one stain. 
 Oh, well, it's early, and it's a small stain. 
 Okay, moving on. 
 Can't find Getz at his home or office. 
 Well, Agent Palmer, know that the LAPD is here to assist the DEA in any way we can on this. 
 Thank you. 
 Now, what sort of background can you give us? 
 Well, it's classified, so none. 
 (chuckles) 
 What is funny? 
 Wha... Come on, Palmer, you serious? 
 You're gonna do this again? 
 You know what happens next-- then we're gonna wear you down with our astute, benevolent charm, right? 
 And our... barely-stained fashions. 
 Okay, fine. Uh, two weeks ago, we picked up chatter suggesting Flaco Ruiz could possibly I.D. a major player in the Flores cartel's money laundering operation. 
 Who? 
 Just know he was important enough for us to fast-track the meeting. 
 (groans) 
 And who else knew about it? 
 No one. It was only in office. 
 (snaps fingers) 
 Ah. That's why you want us to help you find Getz. 
 You think the leak's coming within the DEA. 
 Yeah, possibly. 
 Possibly. And here I was thinking that it was 'cause you had so much fun with me last time. 
 Yes, getting shot at, so fun. 
 Well, you almost ran me over. That was good. 
 Endless stakeout? 
 Right? And remember that squeezy cheese? 
 You loved that. 
 All right. 
 Is it, is it just me, or am I, like, sensing something here? 
 What do you mean, "sensing som..." Sensing what? 
 A thing, man. There's a thing going on. 
 (stammers) 
 It-- I... (sniffs deeply) 
 Smell it. You... you don't... Do you... 
 I don't smell anything. 
 Don't you-- You don't smell a thing? 
 Full disclosure: I did ask Riggs out to dinner, but he said no, so this is strictly professional. 
 Well... (clears throat) 
 Agent Palmer, know that we will do everything we can to find Mr. Leo Getz. 
 Thank you. 
 Detectives. 
 Okay, am I crazy, or is this like watching a five-car pileup in slow motion? 
 Go. 
 I'm on it. Yo, Bailey! 
 I need a list of all major car accidents in the last two hours. 
 On it. 
 You want to find an ambulance chaser, follow the ambulances. 
 Good work, Roger. 
 Yeah. 
 Just hope y'all can keep up, you know? 
 You probably heard about when Rob Kardashian's pool guy had that slip and fall? 
 I handled that. 
 Hey. 
 $3,500. Yeah. 
 So the only thing you have to remember is... 
 ♪ Anything you want, Leo Getz. ♪ 
 I think that's our weasel. 
 Mm-hmm. 
 Not too many of those now, okay? Keep that. There you go. 
 LAPD. 
 Might we have a moment of your time, Mr. Getz? 
 Hey, just want to remind you: sometimes the best medicine is a no-fuss cash settlement. 
 Do that on the stand. 
 Hey. Yes. Detectives. 
 Perhaps we could, uh, kibitz in my office, please? Hmm? 
 Can you just-- come on. 
 What's kibitz? 
 So, gentlemen. What can I do for you? 
 So, what were you doing at Hi-Ho Donuts this morning around 5:00 a.m.? 
 Oh. (chuckles) Wow. 
 Okay, um, well, I was eating-- wait for it-- a donut. 
 All right. Well, you know, we can do this in our office. 
 Coffee's not as good, but the halogens are beautiful. 
 Mm, not unless you're arresting me, so... 
 What a great idea! You're under arrest, an accessory to murder. 
 Okay, okay. 
 That's fine, but those charges had better stick, because if they don't, I'm gonna sue you for violating my rights, misprision of a felony and kidnapping. Okay? 
 Let's do it. 
 Excuse me, sir. Do you have a camera? 
 Can you please document this excessive use of force? 
 Excessive, and I should let you know. 
 I am close friends with Harvey Levin of TMZ! 
 Hey, hey, hey, Leo. 
 Listen, listen, listen. 
 Okay. 
 A few people died today down at that shop. 
 Don't you want to help us know why? 
 Of course I do. 
 I seem to be out of change. 
 Black and creamy. 
 (liquid pouring) 
 It's done! 
 Oh, it's so hot! 
 Okay, I was in the bathroom when the shots were fired, so I didn't see anything. 
 As for Mr. Ruiz, he was my client for exactly one day. 
 What, Flaco hired you the day of? 
 I'm the bus guy. 
 People call me at the last minute all the time. 
 Mr. Ruiz called me because he said the DEA was ready to make a deal, and I was there to help with the negotiation. 
 Of course, before we could get into the specifics, he was-- how shall we say-- relieved of his ability to breathe, so... 
 Hey, listen, don't you think that if we figured it out, that the cartel figured out that you were there, too? 
 If you go out there, it's with a target on your back. 
 Thank you for your concern, but I can take care of myself. 
 Oh, by all means. (clears throat) 
 What are you doing? 
 I thought we were taking him to Palmer. 
 I say let the cartel go after him. 
 You mean use him as bait? 
 Well, yeah. 
 Yeah, it's a good idea. 
 Hey. 
 Okay, I'm gonna need a house taco, and I'm gonna need a phone to talk to your boss. 
 I  am  the boss. 
 Pablo, we both know that this stand is Flores owned and operated. 
 Okay? So I'm gonna need a phone to talk to your boss, the actual boss, so that I can be on the record that I was at the donut shop this morning in an exclusively unofficial capacity. 
 I didn't see anything, I don't know anything, I'm not gonna say anything, and I certainly should not be walking around with a target on my back! 
 Riggs : Doesn't necessarily look like he's ordering tacos, does it? 
 Murtaugh : Mm-mm. Maybe the three-bean,  triple-thick meat burrito requires  that level of gesticulation, but not a taco. 
 Riggs : Uh-oh. 
 What is she doing here? 
 I guess she followed us. 
 Leo : So, I will be waiting for the phone call and the taco. 
 And don't be stingy with the tomatillo. 
 Leo, Agent Palmer, DEA. 
 (men murmuring) 
 I-I don't know you. 
 I don't know you! 
 I don't know her. I don't know you. 
 I would never work with the DEA. 
 Are you... are you actively trying to get me killed? 
 I am here to protect you. 
 Oh, perfect, because the last time you did that, we had a Boston Cream Massacre! 
 Hey! Did you kids order yet? 
 I hear their carne asada is... fantastic. 
 Palmer : Detective Riggs, what a surprise. 
 You lied to me. You were supposed to bring him in for questioning. 
 We just came up with a better plan. 
 Oh, great. What's the plan? 
 We're gonna use him as bait. 
 Wait. What? 
 Wait! What?! 
 I'm bait?! 
 Riggs : Clearly, he wasn't aware of the plan. 
 Leo : By the way, candidly, it's idiotic, because the odds of one of these people taking a shot at me-- These people love-- 
 I'm like a made man around here. 
 I am beloved in this community. 
 I'm like a made man... 
 Leo. Leo! 
 (people screaming) 
 Ah! Help! I'm hit! I'm hit! I'm hit! 
 Relax. It's just salsa. 
 (gasps) 
 Here. 
 Ugh! 
 Good plan. 
 Well, in our defense, it did work. 
 Look, I will get the white board out and I will show you two... 
 (overlapping chatter) 
 Listen, we did, admittedly, have a plan that involved  some  risk to Mr. Getz. 
 But in fairness, we did get Leo and the cook. 
 Yup, yup. 
 So, I mean, it really turned out better than we drew it up. 
 Except you didn't tell  me  the plan. 
 Okay, well, Palmer, we didn't know you liked tacos. 
 Well, that's because you turned down her dinner date. 
 Avery : Murtaugh, that was uncalled for. 
 But it was-- it's a fair point. 
 It's a fair point. 
 Agent Palmer? 
 Yes. 
 We've given you access to both men in our custody. 
 Can you now tell us more about this major player? 
 Hmm? 
 Um... 
 (sighs) 
 All right. 
 He is The Architect. 
 An architect? 
 The Architect. It's how the cartel refers to the man who designed and runs the entire money-laundering operation here in L.A. 
 That's significant. 
 Murtaugh : So does Leo know who he is? 
 Well, I doubt it, but the cook may. 
 I'm filing paperwork to have him transferred to federal lockup. 
 He hasn't said a word since he's been here, but once he's in federal supermax, that will change. 
 Oh, we're not-- What happened to us working together? 
 We tried. You almost got me and my witness killed. 
 Al... But  almost.  I  almost  got him killed. 
 You're missing the "almost" part. 
 Well, that didn't take long. 
 Now she's saying we can't sit at the grown-up table. 
 You two hate the grown-up table. 
 We hate the grown-up table. 
 Plus, we still have our witnesses. 
 Go get Leo to talk. 
 Huh. Getting Leo to talk is the easy part. 
 Getting Leo to shut up-- that's the hard part. 
 What do I want? 
 Well, my terms can be summed up in a word. 
 Protection. 
 For me... and my reputation. 
 Okay, that's six words, and before you start talking terms, you might want to, uh, show us that you have something that we want. 
 Um, well, the cartel tried to kill me... twice, so, uh, clearly, I have value. 
 Or they don't like you. 
 Or you talk too much. 
 Okay, terrific. 
 Yeah? Yeah? 
 Here is me going towards the exit. 
 Here is me going out the door, and once I'm gone... 
 (bangs loudly on table) 
 What do you want? 
 What was Flaco gonna tell the DEA? 
 He didn't tell me. 
 Who is The Architect? 
 I don't know. 
 Who were the gunmen? 
 Okay. 
 When I said I had value, I might have overstated my position by a little bit, but, look, all I ask is that you protect me... from whoever's trying to kill me. 
 All right, so he's useless. 
 Look, I'm gonna go talk to the cook, see if he's got anything... 
 Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. 
 Pablo is still here? 
 (chuckles): Oh. Oh. 
 Uh, last year, I helped get Pablo out of a rather professionally, uh, delicate legal situation, and perhaps you could use that to your advantage. 
 What kind of legal situation? 
 Oh. Hmm. 
 Well, first, I shall require... a beverage. 
 All right. 
 All right, here we go. That's... 
 (groans softly) 
 I prefer sparkling. 
 Ow. 
 Pablo honey! 
 We need to talk. 
 Mm-hmm. 
 Looks like he doesn't want to talk. 
 Well, you know what? 
 Hmm? 
 We can talk. 
 We can talk. 
 We can, right? You and I could-- 
 What do you want to talk-- 
 What do you want to talk about? 
 Let's start with Pablo's recent charges of public indecency. 
 Riggs : Wait. 
 Was that when he was busted with Tito Flores's niece? 
 No, no, no, it wasn't the niece. 
 It was the niece's husband. 
 Riggs : That's right. 
 Yeah. 
 Riggs : You were caught in a parking lot playing hide-the-chalupa. 
 Murtaugh : Mm-hmm. 
 Okay. Just... My lawyer got that kicked. 
 He said it's not on my record. 
 (Riggs and Murtaugh laugh) 
 Riggs : Well, yeah, but it doesn't mean we can't talk about it. 
 And if we talk loud enough, Tito's gonna hear about it. 
 And if Tito hears, then Tito could get really mad. 
 And if he gets mad, well, then it's... bye-bye, chalupa. 
 Ay, chalupa. Ay-ay-ay! 
 Oh, okay, okay, okay. 
 Yeah. What do you want to know? 
 Who's The Architect? 
 I-I don't know. 
 I'm hungry. 
 Mm-hmm. 
 Let's go get some tacos. 
 Yeah. 
 No chalupa. 
 
 
 
 Yeah, I never seen him, all right? 
 No one has. Look, all I can tell you is, everyone's mad about the donut shop screw-up. 
 Screw-up? They took down a DEA agent and Flaco. 
 Yeah, but they missed her. 
 What are you talking about? There were no female victims at... 
 Palmer. 
 She was supposed to be at the donut shop. 
 And she was at the taco stand. 
 (phone ringing) 
 Hey, Riggs. If you're calling me to apologize... 
 Hey, Palmer, where are you? 
 I'm, like, a block away, headed over to get my witness. 
 Listen to me. Leo wasn't the target. 
 You are. 
 (gunfire, people screaming) 
 Murtaugh : Get out of the way! 
 (grunts) 
 Palmer? 
 (sirens approaching) 
 (gasps loudly) 
 (panting) 
 Hey. 
 You okay? 
 (whimpering) 
 Okay. You're okay. 
 (sirens approaching) 
 You're okay. 
 (door opens, closes) 
 Ballistics are in, Ramon. 
 You're going down for murdering a DEA agent, plus two others. 
 Oh, and you tried to kill me three times. 
 And see, she's got a whole three-strike rule when it comes to murder attempts. 
 Look, I know there's nothing I can offer you to get you to turn on the cartel. 
 But there is something I can offer your family. 
 Now, your little brother's doing... five in Pelican Bay. 
 So if you talk, I can have him moved closer to your parents. 
 Or... I can have him put in a solitary unit. 
 No sun, no yard. 
 So it's your call. What do you want? 
 (sighs) 
 I've never seen him. 
 The Architect is like a ghost. 
 All right. Well, I've been working on this case for years, and now all of a sudden there's three attempts on me. 
 Explain that. 
 I got a text on a burner at the crack of dawn. 
 I was barely awake when they told me to go. 
 It couldn't wait? 
 Who'd you piss off Sunday night? 
 (R&B music playing) 
 Trish : Baby, is that you? 
 ♪ ♪ 
 Hey. 
 Hey. 
 You enjoying yourself? 
 I am celebrating my new adventure. 
 (chuckles) I am so proud of you. 
 Me, too. Know why? 
 Why? 
 When I got to work, after the whole partner committee told me how much they loved me... 
 That's right. 
 ...and how much I've done for the firm, Mm-hmm. they promoted... Gene instead. 
 So you  didn't  get it? 
 So I quit. 
 And, Roger... 
 (exhales) it felt so damn good. 
 They don't deserve me there. 
 Yeah. So... 
 (chuckles softly) you quit. 
 That-that means you're unemployed. 
 (laughs): Oh, my-- For the first time! 
 (laughing) 
 In 20 years! Yes! 
 Okay. So, um... 
 I'm j... I'm just wondering, how did you leave it with the firm? 
 Was it, was it amicable? 
 Mm. 
 Hell to the no. (chuckles) 
 It was not amicable. 
 Okay, I just, I just need to know how deep the hole is, you know, just if you change your mind. 
 I need to feel you supporting me here, Roger. 
 Baby, I am. 
 But you know and I know that a detective's salary... 
 You know what? Stop. 
 You're-you're ruining my celebration and my bath. 
 All right. 
 But that resistance pool ain't happening. 
 Get out. 
 Okay. 
 Psst. Hey. 
 You're out of mustard. I was gonna make us sandwiches, but we need mustard. 
 Trish : Roger? 
 We got company, baby. 
 I told you wait in the car. I was starving. 
 Oh. 
 Who is this? 
 Hi. 
 Hello. Leo Getz, Attorney-at-Law. 
 Murtaugh : He's part of the investigation we're working. 
 I have to babysit him for the night. 
 The bus guy? 
 Yeah. 
 Yeah. (chuckles) 
 Yes. Yeah, I have billboards. 
 A  billboard, too. Yes. 
 But, um, I-I'm sorry, I couldn't help but overhear, uh, you talking about your decision to leave your firm, and take it from me, nothing compares to being on your own-- like, being fired from the D.A.'s office was the best thing that ever happened to me, so... worked great for me. 
 I think it'll work for you, too. 
 Thank you, Mr. Getz. 
 For your... support. 
 Trish, we could talk about this. Listen. 
 No. 
 I'm so sorry that... 
 Mm-mm. No. 
 Now... what are we gonna do about this mustard situation, hmm? 
 (bottle squeaking) 
 Palmer :  The last thing I did Sunday night  was file blanket subpoenas for ten businesses with ties to the cartel. 
 And you're saying one of them might be The Architect? 
 Which is why now I have to go through all these financials and figure out which business is hiding our man. 
 All right, well... 
 I'll stay and help. 
 Riggs, no. I mean, this is not fun stuff. 
 You don't get to shoot any guns. 
 You are not chasing anyone. 
 Hey. 
 I know it's baby steps, but I put on a new shirt today. 
 All right? I'm a changed man. 
 (sighs) 
 (sighs) 
 Are you hungry? 
 I was thinking about maybe going... 
 I don't eat out of vending machines. 
 Oh, yeah. 
 Well, yeah, no, that's... 
 Okay. (sighs) 
 (pops lips) 
 If you were gonna eat, right, if you were gonna eat-- not if you were going out to dinner-- like, if you were just gonna, let's say you were just hungry, right, just trying to, like... 
 Chinese. 
 (snaps fingers) 
 Are you a family style? Do you like to go solo? 
 Riggs, order food. 
 Just order. Okay. 
 (siren wailing in distance) 
 Oh! Disgusting. 
 You know what happens in places like this? 
 My clients stay here. 
 Which side do you want? 
 The bed. 
 You take the chair. 
 The chair? 
 Yeah, I can make that work. 
 (sighs) 
 Hey. 
 About that thing with your wife today-- can I offer you a bit of advice, based on my experience? 
 Your experience and my wife's are totally different. 
 She's a legal rock star. 
 You're a... scam artist. 
 Respectfully. 
 (exhales) 
 You want to insult me? That's fine. 
 'Cause at the end of the day... 
 I know how to survive. 
 (chuckles) Yeah. 
 Like a cockroach. 
 Exactly. And you know what? 
 You know those big, fancy law firms, like the one your wife was at? 
 Well, they're all part of a big boys' club. 
 Probably part of why she left. 
 You take me, and you put me at one of those firms, I'd do okay. 
 But you take any one of those silver-spoon prigs and expect them to survive on the street, well... 
 (chuckles) No. 
 They would die like dogs. 
 And you know what? 
 It took some spine to do what your wife did today. 
 If you can't see that, then you got bigger problems than paying for your kids' college.

 (phones ringing, indistinct chatter) 
 How many letters do you lose in a... 
 Good morning. 
 Hey, Rog! 
 What's going on? Look, there's plenty of stacks to go through. 
 We've got, uh, phone logs, tax documents. 
 Have at it, big guy. 
 You two been here all night? 
 Yeah, well, some of us are dedicated, Rog. 
 Mm-hmm. 
 We narrowed The Architect down to one of three firms. 
 So, are we looking for anything specific here? 
 Um, maybe a high-value transfer. 
 Or if you can find an e-mail or text where someone refers to themself as The Architect, that would be helpful. Yeah. 
 What about a phone number? 
 999- 
 536-4389. 
 What is that? 
 I don't know, but it's very familiar. 
 Getz (recorded) : Leo Getz you off. 
 Leo Getz you off. Let Getz you off. 
 Leo Getz you off. 
 Leo Getz, Attorney-at-Law. 
 Leo... is that you? 
 Hey. 
 Is that, is that you? 
 This phone is for legitimate business calls. 
 Someone from Weyburn Advisors called you the night before the donut hit. Who? 
 Uh, that night? 
 Um, I had only one call. Flaco Ruiz. 
 That's it. 
 Weyburn Advisors is The Architect's cover. 
 Okay, um, hold on. 
 Weyburn Advisors-- they have one sole owner and operator: Stafford White. 
 Let's pick him up. 
 No, not yet, you guys. I have to get a warrant. 
 So just go to his office and be ready, okay? 
 Riggs, I mean it-- please wait for me to call, and then you can kick the door in. 
 (chuckles) I told you... I'm a changed man. 
 Changed man. 
 (sighs) 
 What are you doing? 
 Weyburn's up on the 13th floor. 
 Palmer said to wait. 
 Oh, well, yeah, we'll wait, but we'll... you know, wait upstairs. 
 That way, when the warrant arrives, you know, we're on the job ready to go. It's a win-win, really. 
 Trish quit her job. 
 And I don't know if she can get another one, or even if she wants to if she could. 
 Uh, wait a minute. 
 We're talking about your wife, right? 
 (clears throat) 
 I mean, is there a human being alive more capable of taking care of business than Trish Murtaugh? 
 No. I guess not. 
 Come on, what are you worried about? 
 I worry. 
 Bad stuff happens, all the time. 
 (elevator bell dings) 
 Just ask this guy. 
 Wait a minute, is this The Architect? 
 Yeah. 
 This is the guy that Palmer asked us to look for. 
 (elevator bell dings) 
 (groans) 
 Palmer? Palmer?! 
 (phone rings) 
 Hey, Leo. It's a bad time. What's up? 
 Okay, I know this is gonna sound odd, but I am in hot pursuit of an ambulance headed east on Spring! 
 You're chasing an ambulance. 
 I know, I know. Palmer's inside it! 
 A couple of cartel guys dressed like EMTs grabbed her, and they're taking her to who knows where. 
 Hey. They kidnapped Palmer. We got eyes on them. 
 Who has eyes? 
 Leo. 
 Leo? 
 (car horns honking) 
 Okay. They just pulled into some sort of, uh, abandoned diner or gas station. 
 I'm gonna see if I can get closer. 
 Murtaugh :  No, Leo. Stay put until we get there. 
 Okay, so... uh, it's an old hotel on the, on the north side of the highway. 
 I'm out of view. 
 So, uh... what are my, uh... like, uh, rules of engagement here? 
 Murtaugh :  There are no rules. 
 You do not engage! You stand down! 
 Do you understand me? 
 Calm down, calm down. 
 They don't even know that I'm here. 
 They know that I'm here! 
 (gunfire) 
 Come on! Let's go! 
 You see what I'm seeing? 
 Riggs : Palmer. 
 If they get her in that chopper, she's dead. 
 Look, you go after Leo, I'm going after Palmer. 
 Got it. 
 Go, go, go! Let's go! 
 Leo : Wait. 
 Hey. 
 Wait, wait. Wait. 
 Don't shoot. 
 I'm a lawyer. 
 Pilot : Get in! 
 Let's go! 
 Leo! 
 (grunting) 
 All right, all right. 
 (grunts) 
 Take it up! Let's go, let's go! 
 That's a lawsuit waiting to happen. 
 (grunting) 
 (gunshot) 
 Hey! 
 No! 
 Hey! 
 (Palmer shouting) 
 (grunting) 
 (screams) 
 Riggs! 
 Hi. 
 Hello. 
 (grunts) 
 Oh, no. 
 (alarm beeping) 
 Um, I got a plan. 
 No, I got a plan! 
 Both : We jump! 
 Oh. What are the odds? 
 Both have the same plan. 
 Of us surviving? 
 Very little. 
 (screams) 
 (both screaming) 
 (explosion) 
 (groaning) 
 (coughing softly) 
 Well, I figured you'd end up in bed with me. 
 Avery : ...and one decommissioned military helicopter were either seized or destroyed, as half a dozen members of the Flores cartel and their agents were brought to justice earlier today. 
 None of this could have been possible without the work of the DEA, the LAPD and local attorney... Leo Getz. 
 Thank you. 
 I'll now take a few questions. 
 He didn't say my number. 
 Ah. He was supposed to say my number. 
 Come on, Leo. 
 Everyone already knows your number. 
 I guess you're right. Detective, you saved my life; I owe you one. 
 If you're ever in an accident, and need cash settlement, I will take your case, no charge. 
 Reduced rate. 
 Hey, it was a pleasure, Leo. 
 And you're welcome.

 Looks like I got everything. 
 Heading back to D.C.? 
 Yep. 
 Where's Riggs? 
 I-I haven't seen him. 
 Okay. 
 Uh, well, please tell him that I said "so long." 
 And thank you.

 That doesn't come along often.

 If by "nothing," you mean hiding?

 (chuckles) 
 You know, Riggs, since we've been partnered together, I've seen you drunk, crazy, slovenly, rude, insensitive. 
 Did I say "insane"? 
 Ah. You've covered my better qualities. 
 All right. But I've never seen you like this before. 
 How's that? 
 Afraid. 
 Oh, well, I mean, you know, man, I did jump out of a helicopter earlier today. 
 So, you know, I'm sure there's a little-- residual fear is normal. 
 Yeah, but that's not what it is. 
 See, dying doesn't scare you, living does. 
 Now, Palmer's heading back to D.C., and if you hurry, you might be able to catch her. 
 Oh, I, uh... (clicks tongue) 
 You know, I gave her a little-- you know what I mean?-- a little head nod when I was walking out, so... 
 Okay. 
 Well, welcome back to the living, my friend.

 (sighs) I'm considering working up the best grovel letter ever written. 
 Hey. Well, listen. 
 Everything's going to be fine. 
 The only one that made a mistake here was me. 
 You're gonna make this firm regret having treated you like that, and I'm gonna love watching you do it.

 Thank you.

 Hey. 
 Thought you had already, uh, thought you'd already gone. 
 Yeah. Came back for Agent Zigman's badge. 
 Bailey left it on her desk for me. 
 (drawer closes) 
 What are you doing? 
 Uh, just, uh, a lot of, uh, a lot of paperwork. 
 You know, a big-big case that I'm, uh... got going here. 
 It's kind of top secret, though, so I want to keep it kind of covered... 
 That is a Chinese food menu. 
 Well... 
 There's a big MSG poisoning, uh, sting that I've been trying to set up. 
 A racket. Riggs. 
 Yeah? 
 It has been very scary working with you. 
 But not entirely unenjoyable. 
 Well, Agent Palmer, uh, truth be told, it hasn't been entirely unenjoyable working with you.
