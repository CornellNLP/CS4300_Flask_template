 Epifanio :  Previously on "Queen of the South"... 
 I need to go back to Mexico to get what I told you can save our lives. 
 Something went down. 
 I don't know what's gonna happen. 
 Jesus Lord, I know the drill. 
 I need you to be safe. 
 Something wrong with the car? 
 I like it so much, I'm gonna buy four more. 
 I want them delivered to Mexico. 
 If you'd like, there's a guy downtown who can make you fake papers. 
 I need the good ones, the real thing. 
 Real deal starts at 30 grand, per person. 
 (dramatic music) 
 (birds squawking) 
 Bang. 
 A person can get in trouble in my territory. 
 I know you're not authorized to take me out. 
 You're not. 
 As you know, I encouraged Eric to cause difficulties to my wife. 
 I will personally guarantee Eric's safety. 
 We should have a sit-down after you're elected. 
 This is where we get off track. 
 Brenda : What is this? This doesn't make any sense. 
 Teresa : We need to figure out what it means. 
 I promised to stay away from Birdman. 
 So what does that mean? 
 We kill him. 
 (dramatic music) 
 (tense electronic music) 
 ♪ ♪ Jesus, James! Sorry. You shouldn't sneak up on me like that. Real nice. I'm sorry. Look, it's been a tough couple of days... for both of us. I should have called you. I'll make it up to you, okay? Look, I need you to pack some things for a few days. Not this time, James. Please, Kim, something's going on today. I can't live like this... checking my rearview mirror every five seconds. Listen to me. No! I lie in this bed every night with my heart racing, wondering if you're gonna come home or if I'm gonna hear that somebody blew your head off. Yeah, what do you want me to do? I can't just get out. You know that. The only way out is to move up. Forget it. (door slams) It won't always be like this, Kim. (doorknob rattles) We'll talk about this later, okay? Kim, I'm serious. What's happening today... there's gonna be repercussions. I need you to meet me at the trailer. (ambient music) ♪ ♪ (sighs) (knock at door) Yes? One of the girls from the warehouse showed up downstairs. Teresa Mendoza? Send her in. (footsteps approaching) Aren't you doing your deliveries today? Yeah, but I need to talk to you. What is it? I want out. I need to go. I can't be here anymore. Sit. Please. You're worried about what happened in the hotel, about the man you murdered. It was self-defense. You don't have to be scared about that, Teresa. As you know, the maid that saw you... she's dead. I took care of that. You see, you're valuable to me. Changes are coming. And I need everyone in the family. But you know that. Don't worry. We'll protect you. I don't want to be protected. Well, it's not about what you want, now, is it? Do you remember what I told you about your real family? This family? We won't let you down. I killed that man because of you. I'm just afraid the police won't see it that way. You're back in business because of what I did. I bought my freedom with that. So? You have something on me. I got something on you. We're in this together. You seem to forget that if I haven't found you that day, you wouldn't be alive. Call it destiny. And let me tell you something else. When these thoughts start creeping into your mind, when you start thinking like that, forget it. This... this is what matters, and it's forever. So you go back to the warehouse now. Pack your sh1t. Get your deliveries. The Charger will tell you what to do. We're moving. We're taking out someone from another cartel without permission. There will be retaliation. So, as I told you, my most important job some days is to keep all of you safe. Today is just one of those days. Go on now. (dramatic music) ♪ ♪ The charger : Let's go! Let's go! (tense percussive music) Go, hurry! Hurry! Let's go! Let's go! Give me a three. Give me a three. Come on, come on, come on, come on, go! Why are you standing there? Get your ass in line. Move. What's going on? We are clearing out. You've got five hours to get back. (indistinct chatter) Mendoza! ♪ ♪ Take the gray one. The battery died on the red. ♪ ♪ (indistinct chatter) You got a delivery. (truck beeping) Man :  Camila Vargas, jefe. Xander : Does Epifanio know about this? Man : No. (cell phone vibrates, beeps) Yes? Zeferino : The car guy called. The last Rolls was delivered and signed for. Good. Are you out of the warehouse yet? Almost. Well, hurry. What James is doing could happen any moment now. I'm about to board my plane. Just keep me posted, okay? Okay. Let's go. (indistinct chatter) (knock at door) (sighs) Sorry. It's a mess. Stayed up all night going through that book. Did you find anything? I don't know. You tell me. This book is driving me crazy. I Googled what I could on the phone, but it still doesn't make any sense. It's... it's, like, in some kind of code. But I did... I recognized that name, El Limpiador. But I don't know what it means. Let's not worry about it now. We should pack our things. What are you talking about? I'm going to go to a lawyer to get our papers. With what money? How are we gonna pay him? (dramatic music) Where'd you get that? I stole from Camila. Oh, God. Are you out of your mind? I had to. This is crazy! You... we don't even know what this book means, and you want to go back to Mexico where people are chasing us? Maybe we won't need to go back to Mexico. I have an idea. I might be able to sell it to someone here, someone who can hurt Epifanio and Camila. (sighs) Trust me, okay? (scoffs) I know. We need to pack your things. Now that I put things in motion, I can't stop. Let's go. (tense electronic music) (birds squawking) ♪ ♪ (doorbell rings) See who it is. Are you Eric? Who are you? I'm the person that's gonna make your day. ♪ ♪ (suspenseful music) ♪ ♪ You say there are more pages like this? A whole book, yes. Where'd you get it? Does it matter? What matters is why you think I'd be interested in this. Because you're with the Jimenez Cartel. And what I have in those pages can allow you to do a lot of damage to the Vargas Cartel. So I'm pretty sure you're interested. Well, you know a lot about me. Who are you? My name is Brenda Parra. My husband's name was Chino Parra. And he worked with Epifanio right up to the day that that  pinche puto  had him murdered. That's who I am. Okay. Just to be clear, you want to trade a book you claim to have for money. A lot of money. And nothing else? Nothing else. How do you know you can trust me? That information is good. And the book is even better. I'll have to verify that information. Of course. I'll just come back when you're ready to make... No. No need to leave. Just make yourself comfortable. I'm gonna make some calls. Have her wait in the back. (cell phone vibrates) (indistinct chatter) (intercom beeps) Russell (over intercom) : Yeah, who is it? It's me, Teresa. (door buzzes) Tuesday never comes too soon. (reggaeton music playing) I went on a real bender last night, used up all my stash. (laughing) Oh... oh, my God, I'm jonesing. Oh! (sniffs) (snorts) Mmm. Mmm. You never fail me. Remember I talked about getting papers for me and my two friends? I need to start the process. Well, to get started, I'll need about, uh, 90 grand, like we talked about. Um, you've given me $1,000. I'll need about $89,000 more. I'll take cash or check. What about coke? The street value for that is $90,000. Yeah, if I step on it and sell it on the street, but, uh, that's not my business. That's a lot more than $90,000, whether you step on it or not. (dramatic music) You in? ♪ ♪ Yeah. How long will it take? Month or two, maybe more. I'll call you when they're ready. No. I'll call you. You'll never see me again. W-where are you going? I don't know. Spain's nice. (chuckles) Nice. I'll be in touch. Wow. (cell phone ringing) Yeah? Don Manuel, it's Eric. Something interesting has crossed my path. If you're not in the middle of anything. Actually, I was, but I, uh... I just finished. What is it? Eric : A woman came to me with a page from a book she claims has information about Epifanio Vargas' organization. What woman? Brenda Parra. She claims Epifanio's men murdered her husband, Chino Parra. Yeah, I've heard the name. Also heard there's trouble. What's on this page? We got addresses, shipment dates, kilo amounts, two of the locations are just outside of Juárez. We had heard rumors that Epifanio has stash houses in that area. Well, we sent the addresses to our people to check them out. I mean, we'll know soon enough. You said she has an entire book. What does she want for it? Money. It's gonna cost us a considerable sum. Well, it'll cost us a lot more if Epifanio wins the election and refuses to negotiate with us. So I pay her? Let our men confirm that these are, in fact, Epifanio's stash houses first. And if they are, you pay her... and you get that book. (line beeping) Can I use the bathroom? I really have to pee. Thank you. Teresa : Brenda, are you okay? How's it going over there? It's good. He's just... he's confirming some information. How's it going with you? The lawyer's getting us papers. Get the money and meet me back at the hotel, okay? We leave from there. Okay. (birds squawking) What's that noise? (birds squawking wildly) I don't know. Those birds are going crazy out there. (loud thud) Just a minute! I'm washing my hands! What was that? The  pendejo  bodyguard's knocking on the door. (suspenseful music) Brenda, listen to me. You need to get out of the house now. What? Brenda, go! You need to get out of the house now. Okay. sh1t. (screams) There's blood everywhere. Teresa : Go! Leave now! Go! (gunshot) ♪ ♪ (gunshot) (birds squawking wildly) (device beeps) (squawking stops) You prick. They'll come for you. They'll find... ♪ ♪ (ominous music) ♪ ♪ 
 
 sh1t. (cell phone beeps) (cell phone vibrates) Woman (over phone) : Kim is unavailable. Please leave a message. Have you lost your mind? I told you, Kim. You need to call me back now. (cell phone beeps) (lighter clangs, flames whooshing) Kim, I love you very much. I know you know that. But what's happening here, it's not like the other times, okay? It's worse. Some people are gonna try and hurt me, and the only way they can do that is by hurting you. Do you understand me? Look, if you're not here by nightfall, I'm gonna come and get you wherever you are. You know I will. I'm not just gonna sit here and wait while you're out there in danger. That's it. That's where I stand. (cell phone vibrating) Yeah? Hey, she's gone again. What do you mean she's gone? Everyone on her route has called. She never made any deliveries. Was she busted? No, no, I checked. She just fell off the radar. Track her car. Sure. (door opens) Oh, my God, are you okay? Yeah. Are you hurt? I tried to call you. They're dead. Eric, the bodyguards... they're all dead. The man who killed them... did he see your face? Maybe. Probably. I don't know! We're gonna have to go back to Mexico. No! No. I told you, I am not going back to Mexico. Listen to me. The man who killed Eric works for Camila, okay? I stole the coke, and if he saw you, he will want to kill us. Oh, my God. What are we gonna do? We have to figure out the book. What are we figuring out? This book means nothing. You said you recognized a name... El Limpiador. How do you know him? We were at a party one day. We were all high, and Chino had this brand-new car, and this guy challenged him to a race. Chino cut him off, the guy got crazy, and he ran us off the road. That's all I know. It might not even be the same guy. Look at this. His name is El Limpiador, so he probably cleans money. This might be a bank account where they hide all the cash. You still have a cousin that works for a bank in Mexico. Victor, yeah. Maybe he'll help us track this account and find El Limpiador. He'll probably pay us to keep his name in this book secret. We'll hide until we get the papers. Then we disappear. Okay? Okay. We need to go. Help me with this stuff. Come on. We need to pick up Tony. (suspenseful music) ♪ ♪ Okay, let's go. Let's go. Okay. (cell phone rings) Oh, wait, hold on, hold on. This is my cousin. Answer it. Okay. Hey, Victor. Thanks for getting back to me so fast. Are you sure? sh1t. Okay, thank you. Thank you, Victor. I'll call you... I'll call you back. What it is? He checked the numbers. It doesn't belong to any bank account... not enough digits. Does he know what it means? No, he doesn't. We have nothing. We can't go. No, no, we have to go. No. Did you hear what I just said? We have nothing. We have the book. We stay, we die. We go, we still have a chance. Okay? You getting in or not? We have to go. Come on, go. ♪ ♪ Thank you, Señor Vargas, for taking the time to speak with me today. Oh, it's my pleasure. I've been following your work for some time. And that story on NAFTA you had a few weeks ago was very informative. Actually, I would like to ask you some questions myself when you have a chance. Very flattering, Señor Vargas. And I must admit, I find your story fascinating. Thank you. You rose from modest circumstances, born the son of a farmer. You started a small, local produce company and turned it into a thriving international export business. And now you may find yourself moving into the Governor's Mansion. I hope that's not a question. My question, Señor Vargas, is in regards to your past. There have been allegations about your involvement in the drug trade. Let me be absolutely clear. Nothing could be farther from the truth. I'm not, nor have I ever been, a member of any drug cartel of any kind. My opponents have spread lies about me But the voters know that these are just lies. This is for the Birdman. So Epifanio and Camila want a war? Now they have one! They are looking for a man of the people... me... to put an end to these corrupt politicians who for too long have turned a blind eye to the people in favor of these cartels. Let me be clear... I'm no politician. Like most of you, I come from nothing. And I know what it means to be powerless. My campaign is about restoring the power to you, the people of  México. Take it out of the hands of the thugs that are destroying the very fabric of our society  and robbing our children's future. And we all know what I'm talking about, And if I'm elected in two weeks' time,  I promise I will track down every drug dealer I can  and lock them up. I will find every stash house. That's quite a promise. It's more than a promise. I'm a man of my word and the people. Vargas for the people. (dramatic music) (video game beeping) Got you, sucker! (sighs) Maybe it's phone numbers. It's too short to be phone numbers. Yes! Got him! Tony, I bought that for you so you could be quiet. You're driving me crazy. But I just got the coordinates for the next level! I'm about to raid the missile silo! Shh! Give me that. Can I see that? That's it. It's coordinates. It's latitudes and longitudes. Just hold it. (tablet clicking) Let's see if I can find it. Here, I almost got it. (tablet beeping) It's a farm in Mexico. But it's not a bank. Maybe it's a different kind of bank. Epifanio's cartel has hundreds of millions of dollars they have to clean. They're not gonna put it in a real bank, right? This is probably where El Limpiador keeps Epifanio's clean money. Man : Señor Vargas, thank you. There's more bad news, Don Epifanio. What? Pote :  Two of our supply houses were hit today. (toy squeaking) (suspenseful music) ♪ ♪ Where's Batman? He's gathering our soldiers, waiting for your command to retaliate. (groans) Pote! Who's responsible for this? Your boys left you for dead,  cabrón. Who are you with? (groans) The Jimenez Cartel. (sighs) Manuel :  No, hombre, después se cayó el guey del caballo. (laughter) (sighs) Don Manuel, there's someone here to see you. I'm not taking any visitors tonight. I believe you want to see this one. Camila Vargas. You got some balls coming here. You tell me why I shouldn't kill you. You can kill me for killing Eric. That would be a mistake... because I have so much more to offer. I did what I did to Eric. But truth be told, you know how I felt about him. I would be lying if I tell you anything other than I despise him. I must say, your husband's a better diplomat than you are. Diplomacy breeds lies. It breeds deception. You cannot tell people what you really think if you're being diplomatic. And you're right, my husband is much better at it than I am. So you're gonna tell it like it is? That's just the way I'm built. Then you better start telling it now. I used you. You reacted on my attack on Eric exactly the way I needed you to. You attacked Epifanio because you thought he was responsible. And by doing so, you destabilized him for a moment. I needed him to take his eye off the ball. You see, every news program is covering what you did to him. People... they're starting to wonder about the possibility that maybe Epifanio Vargas is not for the people at all, but Vargas is for Vargas. What do you mean? The only thing my husband cannot afford is to fight a war... because if he does, he's gonna be outed publicly as the cartel leader that he is. And his lies are gonna be exposed. So, while he's distracted, backpedaling, and denying any involvement in any of this, I'm gonna take over. You see, he doesn't even know that I'm in Mexico right now. You see how that works? You're taking over? Yes. And when I do, I want us to be friends. Friendship is built with trust. Now, you tell me why I should trust you. (dramatic music) ♪ ♪ I want to make amends to you, reestablish symmetry. You have a top lieutenant in prison. And he's about to be extradited to a supermax prison in Colorado, serving a life sentence for the U.S. government. Go on. I took Eric's life, but I can replace it with this man. I know where he is. He's in a safe house. He's gonna be there until the extradition. And I... I can take him out of there for you. And if you do, Camila... we will be friends. Good. Salud. Salud. (line ringing) (beep) (breathes deeply) (cell phone ringing, beeps) Yes? James : Camila, it's me. You did good. Everything is going as planned. Not everything. Teresa ran. She ran? She's gone. She didn't make deliveries. And she took four keys of coke. She leave any clue... anything that can tell us where she might have run to? No. We tracked her car, but she was gone by the time we got there. Don't worry. I'll find her. No. You stay hidden. You're too valuable for me. It's not safe for you yet, not until I know how this is gonna end. (cell phone beeps) (vehicle approaching) (car door closes) You okay? I'm okay. Right there. Yeah, it's right there. (scoffs) My shoes are wrecked. Ready to see Grandma? Yeah. Okay. Okay. I'm gonna go first, okay? Then you second. Okay. Cuidado, mi'jo. (indistinct chatter) Victor! Hey. Hi. And you must be Teresa. Victor. Let's go. Okay. That's my car. Use it as long as you need to. Okay? Yeah. Thank you. So, Tony, you're coming with me, right? To see Grandma. You're gonna go with him to abuelita's house, okay? No! Yeah, you're gonna go to abuelita's house... it's okay. I want to go with you. I-I just helped you. I know. You said I was... You said we were gonna be together. We are gonna be together. But I have to do something with Teresita, and I can't take you. (somber music) It's gonna be okay,  mi'jo. You just have to be brave, and you have to behave. Okay? ♪ ♪ We got to go, okay? Nice to meet you. Bye. Come on, let's go. Tell me I didn't just lie to my kid. It's gonna be okay, right?
