 TERESA: Previously, on "Queen of the South"...  I have a new job now. 
   As soon as I make enough money, I'll come for you,  and we're gonna move in together. 
   Why are you doing this for me?

   You need to come to my house as soon as you can. 
   These are the ownership documents filed  for Camila's trawler company. 
   TERESA: I never signed these papers. 
   This has to be fake. 
   She found paperwork on some of your companies  in Cole's office. 
   I would never lie to you.

   She says, if we go after her or Kelly Anne,  those files are going to the DEA. 
   Where's Cole? 
   Retired. 
   CAMILA: Teresa hasn't come to visit since she told me  about the paperwork. 
   You should have drug her back by her teeth. 
   We have more immediate threats to deal with right now.

   He set your bail at 2 million. 
   He thinks you're a flight risk. 
   Pay it. 
   And then find Teresa.

   See, I can speak legalese when I need to. 
   (chuckles) 
   We need to keep these safe. 
   Safe is with the DEA. 
   If we give these to the DEA,  she'll never stop hunting us.
