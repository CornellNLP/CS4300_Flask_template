   We got your brother out. 
  Seems like you owe us.

   CAMILA: Your shipment arrives in Galveston tomorrow. 
   And my people will be there to pick it up. 
   You run a tight ship, Camila. 
   Something I've always admired about you. 
   Well, what happened in Mexico was a setback. 
   But soon you'll be sending me packages every week.

   I can send my plane along with my bodyguards  to escort you. 
   Well, how can I say no to that? 
   Boaz will be pleased. 
   He wants to personally thank you  for rescuing him from the DEA. 
   How is your brother? 
   Well, to tell you the truth,  Boaz is a pain in my ass. 
   If my mother weren't alive,  I would have made you put a bullet in his head.

   MANUEL: Okay. 
   You remember Denny, our man in the sheriff's department. 
   We have a situation. 
   Tell her. 
   After the raid, I cozied up to one of the DEA agents. 
   According to her, they have an informant. 
   That's who led them back to the warehouse. 
   -Did she tell you a name? 
  -No, not yet. 
   And I'm gonna require a little more time. 
   I understand. 
   Keep us apprised. 
   Without a name, we don't know how exposed we are. 
   We can't wait on Denny,  not when the Jimenez shipment is coming into Galveston. 
   I'm not taking any chances. 
   You're gonna hunt down  and then  you're gonna kill that rata. 
   (dramatic music) 
   It was a coordinated attack, starting with the tunnels. 
   We don't know that Camila was behind this. 
   The attack could have come from anywhere. 
   Rival cartels. 
   Even the families of my own lieutenants. 
   Papi! 
   Oh. 
   Are you okay? 
   I am fine. 
   Oh, I was so worried about you. 
   Oh, I am here now. 
   Everything's all right, nothing to worry about. 
   Was it the cartel? 
   Yes, but that won't stop me from shutting them down.

   (speaking Spanish) 
  Okay? 
   Wait for me in the den. 
  I'll be right there. 
   Mi'ja.

   The people who did this are rabid dogs. 
   And they are going to be killed that way. 
   And if I'm right? 
   If it was Camila? 
   Then she'll meet the same fate. 
   Are you all right, mi'ja ? 
   When you became governor,  I thought we were through with that life,  through with having to worry that  someone was gonna kill you in the streets. 
   (drink pours) 
   Was I wrong? 
   Was I being naive? 
   Tell me. 
   (uneasy music) 
   No. 
   You're not wrong. 
   That part of my life, of our lives,  is over. 
   Andale. 
   I'm just a governor now. 
  That's all. 
   I had to wage war on the cartel  and rid the streets of their violence once and for all. 
   And as a result,  there are people who want nothing more  than to see me dead. 
   And someday,  God forbid,  if they succeed,  I pray that you remember me  not as the man I was,  but as the man that I aspire to be,  the man who wants nothing more  than to make his daughter proud.

   There's been an assassination attempt on Epifanio. 
   When? 
   This morning, but don't worry. 
  Isabela's fine. 
   She wasn't with him. 
   He escaped without a scratch, though. 
   You're relieved? 
   Epifanio's a b*st*rd. 
   But he's still Isabela's father. 
   If something were to happen to him,  Isabela would be devastated. 
   We're at war. 
   One way or another, she's gonna have her heart broken. 
   He's gonna suspect you ordered the hit. 
   Yeah, I know.

   Yeah, that's Rivas. 
   He's with the Jimenez cartel. 
   He was caught with three kilos. 
   But instead of asking for a lawyer,  he asked for the DEA. 
   So he wants to make a deal. 
   He claims Jimenez is smuggling 200 kilos  into Galveston for Camila. 
   He's offering to give up the load. 
   What we can't figure out is why this guy  would risk his life to snitch on his boss. 
   You want to know what I think? 
   I think you don't look a gift horse in the mouth.

   ♪  You led the DEA to my warehouse. 
   Everything I gave the DEA was a dead end.

   You need to go to Bolivia.
