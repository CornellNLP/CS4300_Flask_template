   You're not going with your father. 
   I don't want to be with you! 
   CAMILA: How many have we lost? 
   JAMES: All of them. 
   Camila needs product. 
   Entonces vamos a hacer un trato. 
   About those funds you requested,  I think I may have a work-around. 
   Teo was a risk to both of us. 
   (crying) 
  Oh, my God. 
   TERESA: You left me. 
   Look, Epifanio, he was--  he was on his way to kill me. 
   They had to do something, okay? 
   -Who's "they"? 
  -The DEA. 
   TERESA: Camila finds out about the DEA, she'll kill you.

  -Screw Epifanio.

   That's the plan.

  I can't do this forever. 
   Let's go. 
  Let's do it. 
   Let's leave Culiacán. 
   I'll fly you anywhere you want to go,  anywhere in the world. 
   And maybe one day,  we can get ourselves a little house on the beach. 
   Just drink cold sangria,  make love all day in the sand. 
   How's that sound?

   Epifanio blew up your plane  because you were stealing from him. 
   Yep. 
   For us, Teresa. 
   I did it for us so we could start over. 
   Go to Spain like we talked about? 
   Drink cold sangria and make love all day  in the white sand.

   What do you want? 
   For you to cooperate in our investigation of Camila Vargas. 
   Miss Mendoza,  I know you're a good person in a bad situation. 
   And you're going to save me? 
   Camila Vargas  is a cold-blooded criminal  who uses loyalty as her currency. 
   Only way out is with a bullet. 
   It won't even be her that pulls the trigger. 
   I'd wager you've already got blood on your hands for her. 
   If I tell you anything,  what happens to me? 
   To Guero? 
   FINNERMAN: We'll put you both in witness protection. 
   United States government will keep you safe and sound. 
   Like you did in Culiacán? 
   If we didn't have surveillance on Epifanio Vargas,  your boyfriend would have been blown to pieces. 
   The fact is, the DEA  doesn't have anything concrete on you. 
   But my buddies over at ICE  would love to toss your illegal ass back to Mexico. 
   I wonder how long it'd take Epifanio to find you. 
   I'd give you 48 hours.

   Dinner's ready. 
   What?

   Thanks for the heads up. 
   I really appreciate you letting me know about it. 
   That was a former associate  that works for the Colombians now. 
   He just contacted me to let me know that Epifanio  is meeting with Reynaldo Fieto. 
   He's about to flood the Texas market with product. 
   And we're just about to get our Jimenez shipment. 
   It's not the best timing. 
   Well, Epifanio took out all of the lieutenants,  so I don't know who's moving the product. 
   But one thing's for certain,  we cannot allow them to reach Texas. 
   If we cut off their transport route,  his distributors will come crawling back to us. 
   We just need to confirm that his tunnel's active. 
   Well, if it is,  destroy it. 
   Take Teresa with you to the border. 
   (brooding music) 
   Why? 
   Leave me in the kitchen like a pinche vieja? 
   No. 
  I'll go instead of her--  No.

   If the tunnel is still active,  it'll be surrounded by Epifanio's men. 
   You know he still wants to kill me. 
   You escaped my husband's wrath  since you fled Culiacán. 
   I have no doubt  your wits will keep you safe once more. 
   And if they don't? 
   We lost everything  and everyone that meant anything to us. 
   You mustn't question your value. 
   We only have each other now.

  -(chuckles softly) 
   My people count on me to mitigate risks. 
   How can I be sure my goods are safe in your hands? 
   Listen--  Don Reynaldo, forgive me,  but I do believe you're underestimating  the governor's power of imagination. 
   Your product  has never been more safe. 
   Really? 
   How is that? 
   The governor has been relentless  when it comes to security and innovation.

   It shoots 15 photos per second.
