   El Santo--Epifanio was always terrified of him. 
   Yeah, Epi, back in '95, he did this deal with Igor,  the Russian, for a large shipment of Kalashnikovs,  and he didn't realize El Santo was involved. 
   The crate got seized by U.S. Customs. 
   Epi, he didn't want to pay; he came home  and found his entire house staff strung up like wet laundry.

   He paid.

   We're almost at the meet point now. 
   I want to thank you for agreeing to use your boats for this run,  for your loyalty.

   I understand. 
   I'm prepared to offer a 10% increase on our arrangement. 
   No, let's call it a gentlemanly 20,  and also I'm gonna have to put  a little clock on this here arrangement. 
   You and your people got 72 hours to get the goods  to the border,  or me and my boats are Cambodia-bound. 
   Fine. 
  Three days.
