 My name's Aveline. 
 Teresa. 
 You just stick close to me and I'll help you out. 
 I'm a mule now. 
 You follow me, you'll end up just like me. What did she do to you? Epifanio : That puta and Guero stole from me. If you find this girl, let me know. I'm going to be governor of Sinaloa,  and you're gonna help me get there. No, it's my business too. You want to take over a trawler company, and you want to hide this information from your husband because of an impending divorce? Camila : More like war. Still nothing on Guero's girlfriend. Pote : But we did get a cell phone ping. Epifanio : You take care of this personally, César. (gunshots) I'm just supposed to keep looking for this girl that means nothing to you, whom you need alive, preferably, and who needs to be made an example of? You know this Mendoza girl? Keep an eye on her. I think she might be more useful than I thought. (soft music) ♪ ♪ One day you're gonna come home and I won't be here, 'cause I'll be dead. Don't say that. You know that, right? ♪ ♪ Right now, you're gonna swear by this holy thing that you got in your hand that you really get it. So you know I never lied to you. ♪ ♪ I swear.

Spent the last five years as a money changer on Calle Juarez. She lived with Guero here. I got in, looked around. Nothing really. How did Guero steal from Epifanio? How did he do it? The details I got were they had someone in with the Federales. They were getting back seized cocaine, re-selling it for themselves. Who took them out? Batman got Guero. Gato and Pote, they dealt with Chino. What about her family? Mm, you won't be able to get to her through that. Epifanio already killed off anything she cared about. He has men everywhere looking for her. California, Florida, Arizona. Whatever he wants her for, it's very important. Important enough to pretend she doesn't mean anything. (tense music) ♪ ♪ (both speaking Spanish) (indistinct chatter in Spanish) Wich one is my bed? Woman : You have five new messages. First message. Brenda : Teresita, it's Brenda. Where are you?

I'm getting really, really worried. sh1t, Teresa. I'm gonna turn my phone off to save the battery. Leave a message for me. (phone vibrating) (phone beeps) She didn't answer again? No, she answered, that's why I'm talking to her right now. Why are you asking me stupid questions? (speaking Spanish) Of course she didn't answer. Drink some water, mijo. You need water. (GPS device beeping) (speaking Spanish) (both chuckle) Hola. (both speaking Spanish) (phone ringing) Hello? Teresa : Brenda? It's me, Teresa. (gasps) Teresita. Oh, my God, you're alive. Brenda : What happened to you? Where are you? Are you okay? Yes, I'm fine. Just listen to me. Brenda : Why'd it take you so long to call me back? You know how many messages I left? You leave me here thinking you're dead and sh1t. You know how upset Tony was? Teresa : I'll explain everything later. Just listen to me. Guero told me that all our phones are theirs. They have their own cell phone network. Towers, everything... all can be tracked. Guero's, Chino's, mine, yours. Do you understand what I'm saying? Turning it off to save battery is what saved your life. They can actually be hearing us right now. You have to destroy your phone and go to the crazy green place, okay? I don't... I don't know what you're talking about. I don't even know what that means. Do you understand what I mean by crazy green place? Oh. Yeah. Yeah, I know. I know, yeah. Okay. Just smash your phone and run. Brenda : Okay. Okay. Bye. (speaks Spanish) Mijo. Come here, mijo. (speaking Spanish) (tense music) ♪ ♪ (indistinct chatter in Spanish) Hey!

Okay. Okay, we're okay. (indistinct chatter) Thank you... for putting me here. Tina, Julie, get dressed. Savings Club. Am I doing something today? Come with me. I don't know how much sh1t you're in, but I know what you're trying to do. And what am I doing? You're trying to ingratiate yourself with Camila. But the second that you become valuable to her, the second she takes an interest in you, it's gonna be harder for you to get out. So be careful. What am I supposed to do? So you did a good job. She was impressed. Just do small things when you're asked. She'll get bored of you. (dramatic music) ♪ ♪ (phone vibrating) Yeah? Why aren't you at Savings Club? James : I'm on my way. Okay. Take Teresa. Why would I do that? I want your opinion on her. I want you to dig deeper. I appreciate that. But she's got no experience. I can't take the risk. It's important to me. Just like staying out of jail or not getting killed is to me. She has no idea what she's doing. Camila : James. I want her to trust you. You're good at that. It's not an option. James : Okay. (tense music) ♪ ♪ Camila wants you to go with us. Come on. See what I mean? ♪ ♪ (phone ringing) Mama? Camila : Isabela. I miss you so much. How are you? Good, good. Busy. Very busy. What's new, right? And you? How are you doing? I'm good. Just heading over to my world lit class. I can't wait to see you next week. Listen, about next week... Mom. Camila : This is as hard for me as it is for you, Isabela. And I was really looking forward to seeing you. It's just... it's work. It's always work. Camila : Something unexpected fell in my lap and... it just needs my full attention. I just don't think it's the right time for me to visit. You know what? Forget it. Camila : Isabela...

You said you wanted a job. So you got it. (door ajar alarm beeps) ♪ ♪ Okay. I forgot, Helen. Look, I said I'm sorry. Helen : I just want to go out and celebrate. Look, you know how buried I've been down here. Helen : You know what? You're a jerk. Give me a break. Look, we'll celebrate this weekend. Helen : Come on! Don't call me that. Look, I said don't call me that. Helen : You know what? I'm hanging up. God... hello? (disconnected tone) Ah, God! Don't look at me like that, Bill. I'm not your wife. All good, James? Better than you, it seems. Yeah. (tense music) ♪ ♪ (phone ringing) (both speaking Spanish) Señorita? (speaking Spanish) Señorita? Telefono. Gracias. Hello? Teresa : Brenda? Teresa, where are you? Why aren't you here? Teresa : 'Cause I'm in America. What does that mean? Listen to me, I can't talk. I'm in the middle of something here, okay? Do you have any money? Around 6,000 pesos. Buy a burner phone. Leave the number with the receptionist at the salon, and I'll call for it later. Take the rest of the money and find a coyote who can take you to Dallas, Texas. (speaks Spanish) Listen to me. Just trust me, okay? Come to Dallas. (speaks Spanish) I don't like gringos. Last time I checked, there was a lot of gringos in Texas. ♪ ♪ Good to go? Who's that?

(speaking Spanish) Say it! (speaking Spanish) Ramirez : She doesn't work for anybody. She crossed the border a few days ago looking for work. Bullshit! (grunts) You're working for Camila Vargas! (speaking Spanish) And I know it. (speaking Spanish) And you are going to say it! (speaking Spanish) You and your friends are going down hard, darling! Federal time! (speaking Spanish) (phone ringing) This is my boss. And by the third ring, I answer it. And you're done. Queen : A snitch is a snitch. ♪ ♪ 
 
 Don't do it. (phone continues ringing) (speaking Spanish) ♪ ♪ Camila : Can you hear me, Teresa? Get out of the van. Vamonos.  (Let's go) ♪ ♪ That thing you did yesterday, swallowing the drugs, I was impressed. But even a rabbit will chew off its own leg to get out of a trap. I needed to know I can trust you. Now I know I can. ♪ ♪ (horn honks) James : I didn't even know that was gonna happen. The thing you need to understand is that's who she is. And the second you think you know where you're at, the ground shifts underneath you. I told you, be careful. Now you know what I mean. The last time I'm gonna talk about this. (tense music) ♪ ♪ Who's the guy with the hose? The one you just nodded to? ♪ ♪ We own him. If I ever see him watering his plants, and he doesn't stop by the time I get there, I keep driving. ♪ ♪ There's our buyer. What are you doing? I want to meet him. No, you don't want to meet him. If he sees your face, he knows you. She knows you know him. See how that works? If I know too much, I'm indispensable. If I know too little, I'm disposable. Did you listen to a word I said? ♪ ♪ Lopez. Who's she? She's new. She's running with me. I don't like "new," James. I like faces I know. Where's Aveline? She O.D.'d. Shame. I don't like this. Look, if you have a problem, take it up with Camila. I can sell this load someplace else. ♪ ♪ All right. You vouch for her? You take responsibility for her. ♪ ♪ Welcome. Keep it close. I won't be long. Thank you. Thank you, sir. (soft piano music) ♪ ♪ Camila. Hello. So, what have you got? That trawling company you want to quietly buy. Gulf of Mexico. Yes. They're willing to sell. Hell, they're practically willing to give it away. Two of their boats are in dry dock for repairs, and they can't afford to fix them. The other two are barely seaworthy. They got three bank loans. Two sisters run it now for the mother. She's sick. She's got cancer. She's not long for this world. They're looking to get out, move back to Cincinnati where their brother is. And you got all that in just 24 hours? Yeah. I like to dig. I can see that. However... sometimes you find things you don't expect. Your husband, for example, has his big toe stuck in most of the shipping in the gulf, and I think we both understand what he's shipping, and it's not swordfish. You neglected to tell me that. Because it's not relevant. Ah, when you said you wanted to keep this from your husband it was because of this fact. Not because you're trying to hide a little something off the books for yourself. I never said I was trying to hide a little something off the books. Yes, but you led me to believe that that was the case. You have a history in asset distribution. It's not my fault that most of that business is between husbands and wives, and you just assumed that it was my case too. When I agreed to do this, I didn't mean antagonizing one of the largest businessmen in Sinaloa. I don't get my hands dirty. Oh, but your hands are not dirty, just your fingernails. There was a fisherman in the region. He had three boats. He complained about some of the other boats violating harbor passage rules without penalty. The next week, they found some of him... most of him in an oil barrel. Now I believe you can probably buy his company too. Guess whose boats were violating the rules. Everything my husband has, I helped him build. So if you're afraid of him, you have to be afraid of me too. He won't know what happened until it's too late. I need boats for shipping. And all you need to know is that I'm fortifying my business in a large and meaningful way. And that by the time he figures that out, he's gonna have bigger problems on his plate than the lawyer that quietly filed shell corp documents, believe me. You said you work on percentages, right? That's what you said? For your loyalty, I'm willing to give you a piece of... whatever I bring. And let me make one thing clear. Even the smallest percentage number, the one that's running through your head right now, the one you're hoping I will agree to, even if you cut that number in half, and then cut it in half once more, you would be able not only to lease an entire floor here, but to buy the whole damn building.

♪ Remember what the dormouse said ♪ (tense music) ♪ ♪ This one is fake. They're ripping you off. All U.S. money paper weighs a gram. This one is too light. I don't see it. You don't see it, you feel it. The difference between a real one and a fake is the paper. Are you sure? I was a money changer for five years in Sinaloa. My life depended on it. It still does. You accuse these men of cheating us and it's a mistake? In Sinaloa... you don't make a mistake with your bosses' money. I spent five weeks in the hospital. I'll never make that mistake again. ♪ ♪ Hey. Something the matter? (clears throat) ♪ ♪ I'm gonna need to weigh this bill. You think I'm cheating you? I don't know.

No, no, no, I've been working for you for almost nine months, Mr. Lopez. You know me. I never cheated you. Hey, you want to check my house? Here, take the damn keys. I have never stolen from anyone in my life, ever. Don't check his house, check his car. I knew a man who hid it in his car 'cause then he wouldn't have to collect it when he had to run.

How come you knew those bills were counterfeit? I saw something was wrong. What did you see? One of the guys kept cracking his neck. He was nervous. Guero taught me to look out for those things.
