 MAN: Previously on Queen of the South... 
   (speaking Spanish) 
   And just because your father and I are separated  doesn't mean we can't have a relationship. 
   I don't want anything to do with that world. 
   You do need a new supplier, and I can connect you with one. 
   El Santo. 
  You need to go to Bolivia.

   Yeah. 
  Some people call me that. 
   But it is a name  that can never be taken. 
   EL SANTO: It must always, always be given. 
   (sighs) 
   Why are you here, Teresa? 
   My soldiers had to pull you  from the jaws of my enemy. 
   La Capitána. 
   She would have had her fill of you. 
   We represent Camila Vargas. 
   Why are we being held as prisoners? 
   I was not addressing you,  James. 
   Go on. 
   We were hoping to start a relationship with you. 
   The quality of your product is known everywhere. 
   Well, I doubt that those that you have encountered  have any concept  of the true nature  of quality. 
   So... 
   what? 
   You're washing your product with ether. 
   It's an old technique and a dangerous one. 
   I know something more dangerous. 
   Mediocrity. 
   Where is the evil in the process of cocaine, Guero Dávila? 
   Hmm? 
   You have traveled all over the world,  you have sold to carpenters and kings. 
   Where does the serpent  slip its fangs with the venom? 
   (soft hiss) 
   Where grown men sell to children. 
   Oh, no. 
   Oh, no, no, no, no, no. 
   When cocaine is treated  with the reverence it deserves... 
   It can make even children smile. 
   The evil's in the wash. 
   ♪  Why? 
   Most leave cocaine impure  because impurities makes it heavier,  which means more profit. 
   And washing in ether  makes it truly pure. 
   And where did you learn this? 
   In the streets of Culiacán. 
   Mmm. 
   How much do you seek? 
   100 kilos to start. 
   No. 
   I deal in nothing less than metric tons. 
   It's just too much. 
   There must be another deal we can make. 
   Do you know why I do not sell to the Americas? 
   Because of deals! 
   Silver passing from mouth to mouth! 
   Like a parasite! 
   Well, I... 
   ...Will not be infested  by your faithless deals. 
   And yet here we are.

   See, you have spilled the blood of my people  when you were trying to escape. 
   So a blood sacrifice is demanded. 
   So I'm going to give you a choice, Teresa.

   Ah, Jesus.

   Yeah, same with Pedro. 
   After Manuel was killed, he's just different, you know?

   We're in this prison because of you.
