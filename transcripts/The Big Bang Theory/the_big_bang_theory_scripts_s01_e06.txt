 Scene: Lobby of the apartment building, Howard, Raj, Sheldon and Leonard enter in combat gear, covered in blue paint. 
 Raj: Okay, if no-one else will say it, I will. We really suck at paintball. 
 Howard: That was absolutely humiliating. 
 Leonard: Oh, come on, some battles you win, some battles you lose. 
 Howard: Yes, but you don’t have to lose to Kyle Bernstein’s Bar-Mitzvah party. 
 Leonard: I think we have to acknowledge, those were some fairly savage pre-adolescent Jews. 
 Sheldon: You know, we were annihilated by our own incompetence and the inability of some people to follow the chain of command. 
 Leonard: Sheldon, let it go. 
 Sheldon: No, I want to talk about the fact that Wolowitz shot me in the back. 
 Howard: I shot you for good reason, you were leading us into disaster. 
 Sheldon: I was giving clear, concise orders. 
 Leonard: You hid behind a tree yelling “get the kid in the yarmulkah, get the kid in the yarmulkah.” 
 Penny (arriving): Oh, hey guys. 
 Leonard: Hello Penny. 
 Howard: Morning ma’am. 
 Penny: So, how was paintball, did you have fun? 
 Sheldon: Sure, if you consider being fragged by your own troops fun. (To Howard) You clear space on your calendar, there will be an enquiry. 
 Penny: Okay, um, oh hey, I’m having a party on Saturday so if you guys are around you should come by. 
 Leonard: A party? 
 Penny: Yeah. 
 Howard: A boy-girl party? 
 Penny: Well, there will be boys, and there will be girls, and it is a party. So, it’ll just be a bunch of my friends, we’ll have some beer, do a little dancing… 
 Sheldon: Dancing? 
 Leonard: Yeah, I don’t know, Penny… 
 Sheldon: The thing is, we’re not…. 
 Leonard: We’re really more…. 
 Sheldon: No. 
 Leonard: But thanks, thanks for thinking of us. 
 Penny: Are you sure? Come on, it’s Halloween. 
 Sheldon: A Halloween party? 
 Howard: As in, costumes? 
 Penny: Well, yeah. 
 Leonard: Is there a theme? 
 Penny: Um, yeah, Halloween. 
 Sheldon: Yes, but are the costumes random, or genre specific? 
 Penny: As usual, I’m not following. 
 Leonard: He’s asking if we can come as anyone from science-fiction, fantasy… 
 Penny: Sure. 
 Sheldon: What about comic-books? 
 Penny: Fine. 
 Sheldon: Anime? 
 Penny: Of course. 
 Sheldon: TV , film, D&D, Manga, Greek Gods, Roman Gods, Norse Gods… 
 Penny: Anything you want, okay? Any costume you want. Bye. 
 Howard: Gentlemen, to the sewing machines. 
 Credits Sequence 
 Scene: The apartment living room. There is a knock on the door. 
 Leonard (off): I’ll get it. (He enters, wearing a Flash costume. Opens door.) 
 Howard (Entering at speed, also wearing a Flash costume): Bjow (They stare at each other in shock.) 
 Leonard: Oh, no. 
 Sheldon: Oh no! (He is also wearing a Flash costume.) 
 Raj: Make way for the fastest man alive. (Enters, also in a Flash costume.) Oh no! 
 Sheldon: See, this is why I wanted to have a costume meeting. 
 Leonard: We all have other costumes, we can change. 
 Raj: Or, we could walk right behind each other all night and look like one person going really fast. 
 Howard: No, no, no, it’s a boy-girl party, this Flash runs solo. 
 Leonard: Okay, how about this, nobody gets to be The Flash, we all change, agreed? 
 All: Agreed. 
 Leonard: I call Frodo! 
 All: Damn! 
 Scene: The same, later. Leonard is dressed as Frodo. Howard appears to be Peter Pan. There is a knock on the door. 
 Raj (Entering dressed as Thor): Hey. Sorry I’m late, but my hammer got stuck in the door on the bus. 
 Leonard: You went with Thor? 
 Raj: What? Just because I’m Indian I can’t be a Norse God? No, no, no, Raj has to be an Indian God. That’s racism. I mean, look at Wolowitz, he’s not English, but he’s dressed like Peter Pan. Sheldon(entering in a body suit featuring black and white vertical lines) is neither sound nor light, but he’s obviously the Doppler Effect. 
 Howard: I’m not Peter Pan, I’m Robin Hood. 
 Raj: Really, because I saw Peter Pan, and you’re dressed exactly like Cathy Rigby. She was a little bigger than you, but it’s basically the same look, man. 
 Leonard: Hey, Sheldon, there’s something I want to talk to you about before we go to the party. 
 Sheldon: I don’t care if anybody gets it, I’m going as the Doppler Effect. 
 Leonard: No, it’s not… 
 Sheldon: If I have to, I can demonstrate. Neeeeoooowwwww! 
 Leonard: Terrific. Um, this party is my first chance for Penny to see me in the context of her social group, and I need you not to embarrass me tonight. 
 Sheldon: Well, what exactly do you mean by embarrass you? 
 Leonard: For example, tonight no-one needs to know that my middle name is Leakey. 
 Sheldon: Well, there’s nothing embarrassing about that, your father worked with Lewis Leakey, a great anthropologist. It had nothing to do with your bed-wetting. 
 Leonard: All I’m saying is that this party is the perfect opportunity for Penny to see me as a member of her peer group. A potential close friend and… perhaps more. I don’t want to look like a dork. 
 Scene: The hallway. Howard knocks on Penny’s door with his bow.  
 Howard: Just a heads up fellas, if anyone gets lucky I’ve got a dozen condoms in my quiver. 
 Penny (opening door, not in costume): Oh, hey guys. 
 Leonard: Hey, sorry we’re late. 
 Penny: Late? It’s 7:05. 
 Sheldon: And you said the party starts at seven. 
 Penny: Well, yeah, when you start a party at seven, no-one shows up at, you know, seven. 
 Sheldon: It’s 7:05. 
 Penny: Yes. Yes it is. Okay, well, um, come on in. 
 Howard: What, are all the girls in the bathroom? 
 Penny: Probably, but in their own homes. 
 Sheldon: So what time does the costume parade start? 
 Penny: The parade? 
 Sheldon: Yeah, so the judges can give out the prizes for best costume, you know, most frightening, most authentic, most accurate visual representation of a scientific principle. 
 Penny: Oh, Sheldon, I’m sorry but there aren’t going to be any parades or judges or prizes. 
 Sheldon: This party is just going to suck. 
 Penny: No, come on, it’s going to be fun, and you all look great, I mean, look at you, Thor, and, oh, Peter Pan, that’s so cute. 
 Leonard: Actually, Penny, he’s Rob… 
 Howard: I’m Peter Pan! And I’ve got a handful of pixie dust with your name on it. 
 Penny: No you don’t. Oh, hey, what’s Sheldon supposed to be. 
 Leonard: Oh, he’s the Doppler Effect. 
 Sheldon: Yes. It’s the apparent change in the frequency of a wave caused by relative motion between the source of the wave and the observer. 
 Penny: Oh, sure, I see it now, the Doppler Effect. Alright, I’ve got to shower, you guys um, make yourselves comfortable. 
 Leonard: Okay. 
 Sheldon: See, people get it. 
 Time shift, the party is in full swing, the four guys are sitting together around the coffee table.  
 Raj: Mmmm, by Odin’s beard, this is good Chex Mix. 
 Howard: No thanks, peanuts, I can’t afford to swell up in these tights. 
 Sheldon: I’m confused. If there’s no costume parade, what are we doing here? 
 Leonard: We’re socialising. Meeting new people. 
 Sheldon: Telepathically? 
 Penny (crossing the room in a cat costume, speaking to someone off-screen): Oh hey, when did you get here, Hi! 
 Raj: Penny is wearing the worst Catwoman costume I have ever seen, and that includes Halle Berry’s. 
 Leonard: She’s not Catwoman, she’s just a generic cat. 
 Sheldon: And that’s the kind of sloppy costuming which results from a lack of rules and competition. 
 Howard: Hey guys, check out the sexy nurse. I believe it’s time for me to turn my head and cough. 
 Raj: What is your move? 
 Howard: I’m going to use the mirror technique. She brushes her hair back, I brush my hair back, she shrugs, I shrug, subconsciously she’s thinking we’re in sync, we belong together. 
 Leonard: Where do you get this stuff? 
 Howard: You know, psychology journals, internet research, and there’s this great show on VH1 about how to pick up girls. 
 Raj: Oh, if only I had his confidence. I have such difficulty speaking to women. Or around women. Or at times, even effeminate men. 
 Howard: If that’s a working stethoscope, maybe you’d like to hear my heart skip a beat. 
 Nurse Costume Girl: No thanks. 
 Howard: No, seriously, you can, I have transient idiopathic arrhythmia. 
 Leonard: I want to get to know Penny’s friends, I just, I don’t know how to talk to these people. 
 Sheldon: Well, I actually might be able to help. 
 Leonard: How so? 
 Sheldon: Like Jane Goodall observing the apes, I initially saw their interactions as confusing and unstructured, but patterns emerge, they have their own language if you will. 
 Leonard: Go on. 
 Sheldon: Well, it seems that the newcomer approaches the existing group with the greeting “How wasted am I?” which is met with an approving chorus of “Dude.” 
 Leonard: Then what happens? 
 Sheldon: That’s as far as I’ve gotten. 
 Leonard: This is ridiculous, I’m jumping in. 
 Sheldon: Good luck. 
 Leonard: No, you’re coming with me. 
 Sheldon: Oh, I hardly think so. 
 Leonard: Come on. 
 Sheldon: Aren’t you afraid I’ll embarrass you? 
 Leonard: Yes. But I need a wing-man. 
 Sheldon: Alright, but if we’re going to use flight metaphors I’m much more suited to being the guy from the FAA, analysing wreckage. 
 Girl in Hippie Costume: Oh, Hi! 
 Leonard: Hi. 
 Sheldon: Hello. 
 Girl: So, what are you supposed to be? 
 Sheldon: Me? I’ll give you a hint. Neeeeooooowwwww! 
 Girl: Uh, a choo-choo train? 
 Sheldon: Close! Neeeeeoooooowwwww! 
 Girl: A brain damaged choo-choo train? 
 Girl in Butterfly Costume (dropping onto sofa next to Raj): How wasted am I? (Raj shrugs.) 
 Time shift. Sheldon and Leonard are now talking to a girl in a princess costume. 
 Sheldon: Neeeeeooooowwwwww! 
 Girl: I still don’t get it. 
 Sheldon: I’m the Doppler Effect. 
 Girl: Okay, if that is some sort of learning disability, I think it’s very insensitive. 
 Leonard: Why don’t you just tell people you’re a zebra? 
 Sheldon: Well, why don’t you just tell people you’re one of the seven dwarves. 
 Leonard: Because I’m Frodo. 
 Sheldon: Yes, well, I’m the Doppler Effect. 
 Leonard: Oh no. 
 Sheldon: What? 
 Leonard: That’s Penny’s ex-boyfriend. 
 Sheldon: What do you suppose he’s doing here? Besides disrupting the local gravity field. 
 Leonard: If he were any bigger, he’d have moons orbiting him. 
 Sheldon: Oh, snap. So I guess we’ll be leaving now. 
 Leonard: Why should we leave? For all we know, he crashed the party and Penny doesn’t even want him here. (Penny and Kurt hug). 
 Sheldon: You have a back-up hypothesis. 
 Leonard: Maybe they just want to be friends. 
 Sheldon: Or maybe she wants to be friends, and he wants something more. 
 Leonard: Then he and I are on equal ground. 
 Sheldon: Yes, but you’re much closer to it than he is. 
 Leonard: Look, if this was 15,000 years ago, by virtue of his size and strength, Kurt would be entitled to his choice of female partners. 
 Sheldon: And male partners. Animal partners. Large primordial eggplants, pretty much whatever tickled his fancy. 
 Leonard: Yes, but our society has undergone a paradigm shift, in the information age, Sheldon, you and I are the alpha males. We shouldn’t have to back down. 
 Sheldon: True. Why don’t you text him that and see if he backs down? 
 Leonard: No. I’m going to assert my dominance face to face. 
 Sheldon: Face to face? Are you going to wait for him to sit down, or are you going to stand on a coffee table? 
 Leonard: Hello Penny. Hello Kurt. 
 Penny: Oh, hey guys. You having a good time? 
 Sheldon: Given the reaction to my costume, this party is a scathing indictment of the American education system. 
 Kurt: What, you’re a zebra, right? 
 Sheldon: Yet another child left behind. 
 Kurt: And what are you supposed to be, an Elf? 
 Leonard: No, I’m a Hobbit. 
 Kurt: What’s the difference? 
 Leonard: Uh, a Hobbit is a mortal Halfling inhabitant of Middle Earth, whereas an Elf is an immortal tall warrior. 
 Kurt: So why the hell would you want to be a Hobbit? 
 Sheldon: Because he is neither tall nor immortal, and none of us could be The Flash. 
 Kurt: Well, whatever, why don’t you go hop off on a quest, I’m talking to Penny here. 
 Leonard: I think we’re all talking to Penny here. 
 Sheldon: I’m not. No offence. 
 Kurt: Okay, maybe you didn’t hear me, go away. 
 Penny: Alright Kurt, be nice. 
 Kurt: Aw, I am being nice. Right little buddy. 
 Penny: Kurt! 
 Leonard: Okay, I understand your impulse to try to physically intimidate me. I mean, you can’t compete with me on an intellectual level and so you’re driven to animalistic puffery. 
 Kurt: Are you calling me a puffy animal? 
 Penny: Of course not, no, he’s not, you’re not, right Leonard? 
 Leonard: No, I said animalistic. Of course we’re all animals, but some of us have climbed a little higher on the evolutionary tree. 
 Sheldon: If he understands that, you’re in trouble. 
 Kurt: So what, I’m unevolved? 
 Sheldon: You’re in trouble. 
 Kurt: You know, you use a lot of big words for such a little dwarf. 
 Penny: Okay, Kurt, please. 
 Leonard: No, Penny, it’s okay, I can handle this. I’m not a dwarf, I’m a Hobbit. A Hobbit. Are misfiring neurons in your hippocampus preventing the conversion from short-term to long-term memory? 
 Kurt: Okay, now you’re starting to make me mad. 
 Leonard: A homo-habilus discovering his opposable thumbs says what? 
 Kurt: What? 
 Leonard: I think I’ve made my point. 
 Kurt: Yeah, how about I make a point out of your pointy little head. 
 Sheldon: Let me remind you, while my moral support is absolute, in a physical confrontation I will be less than useless. 
 Leonard: There’s not going to be a confrontation, in fact I doubt if he can even spell confrontation. 
 Kurt (physically lifting Leonard from the ground): C – O – N… frontation! 
 Penny: Kurt, put him down this instant. 
 Kurt: He started it. 
 Penny: I don’t care, I’m finishing it, put him down. 
 Kurt: Fine. You’re one lucky little leprechaun. 
 Sheldon: He’s a Hobbit! I’ve got your back. 
 Penny: Leonard, are you okay. 
 Leonard: Yeah, no, I’m fine. It’s good, it’s a good party, thanks for having us, it’s just getting a little late so…. 
 Penny: Oh, okay, alright, well thank you for coming. 
 Sheldon: Happy Halloween. (They leave) If it’s any consolation, I thought that homo-habilus line really put him in his place. 
 
 
 
 Scene: The living room. Sheldon brings Leonard a cup of tea. 
 Leonard: What’s that? 
 Sheldon: Tea. When people are upset the cultural convention is to bring them hot beverages. There there. You want to talk about it? 
 Leonard: No. 
 Sheldon: Good. There there was really all I had. 
 Leonard: Good night Sheldon. 
 Sheldon: Good night Leonard. 
 Penny (knocking on door and entering): Hey Leonard. 
 Leonard: Hi Penny. 
 Penny: Hey, I just wanted to make sure you’re okay. 
 Leonard: I’m fine. 
 Penny: I’m so sorry about what happened. 
 Leonard: It’s not your fault. 
 Penny: Yes it is. That’s why I broke up with him, he always does stuff like that. 
 Leonard: So why was he at your party? 
 Penny: Well, I ran into him last week and, he was… just, all apologetic, about how he’s changed, he was just going on and on and I believed him, and I’m an idiot because I always believe guys like that and… I can’t go back to my party because he’s there, and I know you don’t want to hear this and I’m upset and I’m really drunk and I just want to… (bursts into tears and rests head on Leonard’s shoulder.) 
 Leonard: There there. 
 Penny: God, what is wrong with me. 
 Leonard: Nothing, you’re perfect. 
 Penny: Gah, I’m not perfect. 
 Leonard: Yes you are. 
 Penny: You really think so, don’t you? (She kisses hm.) 
 Leonard: Penny? 
 Penny: Yeah. 
 Leonard: How much have you had to drink tonight? 
 Penny: Just…. a lot. 
 Leonard: Are you sure that your being drunk, and your being angry with Kurt doesn’t have something to do with what’s going on here? 
 Penny: It might. Boy, you’re really smart. 
 Leonard: Yeah, I’m a frickin’ genius. 
 Penny: Leonard, you are so great. Why can’t all guys be like you? 
 Leonard: Because if all guys were like me, the human race couldn’t survive. 
 Penny: I should probably go. 
 Leonard: Probably. 
 Penny (in doorway): Thank you. (She kisses him again. Kurt is watching.) 
 Leonard: That’s right, you saw what you saw. That’s how we roll in The Shire. (Closes door quickly, locks and chains it.) 
 Scene: The apartment, there is a knock on the door.  
 Sheldon: Coming. (Opens door to Howard.) 
 Howard: Hey, have you seen Koothrapali? 
 Sheldon: He’s not here. Maybe the Avenger summoned him. 
 Howard: He’s not the Marvel comic story, he’s the original Norse God. 
 Sheldon: Thank you for the clarification. 
 Howard: I’m supposed to give him a ride home. 
 Sheldon: Well I’m sure he’ll be fine. He has his hammer. 
 Scene: A random bedroom. Butterfly costume girl is climbing off of Raj.  
 Butterfly Girl: Wow, I have to say, you are an amazing man. You’re gentle and passionate, and my God, you are such a good listener! 
 (Raj puts hands behind head with a smug expression on his face.)
