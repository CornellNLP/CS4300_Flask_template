 Like, he gon' keep talking to me the whole ride too, man. 
 He was like, "So, uh, how you doing back there?" 
 I was like, "Well, I'm going to jail, n#gga, not great." 
 "Well, you know you need to own up to what you did." 
 Like, what did I do, man? There was no victim, n#gga. 
 Get the f*ck out my face. 
 My cop tried to get me to snitch on you. 
 Word? 
 Yeah, he was like, "We both know whose fault this is. What was he thinking?" 
 [laughs] 
 It was, like, what... a total trap. 
 Man, you see? You see how they do? 
 Never been arrested before, man. 
 Yeah. 
 [chuckles] 
 Should've ditched that weed, though. 
 Yeah, there was a lot going on, so I kind of forgot to do that. 
 It was just, like, half a blunt. 
 Like, you've been arrested for weed. 
 It's not that bad, right? 
 Well, it's not as good as not getting arrested for weed, huh? 
 Look... 
 That's Gina Simms, man. 
 That's Gina Simms from that T-Pain video. 
 Oh, shorty is bad. Damn. 
 Wonder what she's doing here now. 
 I don't know, man. I don't think that's her. 
 No, no, no, no, no. 
 That is definitely her, man. 
 I know that ass anywhere. You know what I mean? 
 Nah, man. 
 [sneezes loudly] Gina! 
 [both laughing] 
 You see? See, I told you. 
 No, she was trying not to look. 
 Like a deer in the headlights, like... 
 [both laughing] 
 You think he's dead, man? 
 I do not know what you're talking about. 
 And now is definitely not the time.

I'm free to go? Yes, sir. They're still investigating the shooting, so you might have to come back for that later, but your bond has already been paid for the disorderly conduct charge. Well, hold up, what about my cousin? Earnest Marks? He's not in the system yet, but when he is, then his bail can be posted. Well, what's the charge? What's the charge? N#gga, this ain't a movie. You better wait till he's in the system. [whispering] I hate this place. Is that Paper Boi? Oh, man! Yo, what's up, man? Thank God, man. What it do? Yo, you know y'all made the news, right? Damn.

Everybody... everybody has always slept. If you want to sleep, you got to wait till you're processed and sent to your cell upstairs. Man, can y'all please send me upstairs? I'm so tired. No. If you want to sleep, you should have thought about that before you came to jail. I don't believe this. Ridiculous, man. Man, what'd you do to get in here? Um... Damn, man. [stammers] I should've just went home, boy. sh1t, instead I'm in here, locked up, 'cause of this fool I ain't seen in about 11 years, man. Boy, I was at Five Points, 'bout to catch a bus, feel me? And this n#gga I ain't seen led me and come on talking about, "Man, listen, hey, I ain't seen you in about 11 years, boy. Let's hang out. You know, get a beer." So I followed him to the g#dd*mn gas station. We get two beers, ain't get but two of 'em, but they were the big ones, though; they were the big ones. Anyway, so he like, "Man, come on, let's go up to the house and drink 'em." So we get to the house, he like, man, my old lady...[murmurs] So we gon' drink 'em on the porch, feel me? I'm like, "Boy, APD be rolling through here, boy." And he done talked me into it, so, sure enough, APD done roll up and seen the g#dd*mn two cans out there. Locked me up for public intoxication. You know... [indistinct] Now I'm in here, man, 'cause this n#gga, man, I ain't seen in 11 years, man. I'm gonna be in here till Tuesday 'cause I ain't cash my check. That's messed up.

I listen to Biggie and Mobb Deep still. But nowadays, you got these singin' a#s n#ggers like Fetty Wap and the gang now. Man, that sh1t is weak. [chuckles] But it's good to see a rapper that would just blow a n#gga brains out on the street. That's that '90s sh1t, B. Hey, yo, homeboy hooked you up. He made you the lemon pepper joints, but these got the sauce on them. Oh, snap. Lemon pepper wet? [soft triumphant music] Oh, my God. Hey, hey, yo, my n#gga. Bring that down, man.
