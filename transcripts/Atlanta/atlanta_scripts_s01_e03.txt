 Next customer. 
 Um, can I get a kid's meal? 
 Huh? What was that, sir? 
 Can I get a kid's meal? 
 Speak up. There's a lot going on here, honey. 
 Can I get a kid's meal? 
 I don't see no kids. 
 Yeah, I don't have a kid with me. 
 I'm gonna eat it. 
 Well, only a kid can order a kid's meal. 
 That's not true. I know that's not true. 
 Oh, yeah, it is. Only a kid can order it. 
 So a kid has to wait in line and order a kid's meal. 
 A kid can't get an adult meal? 
 Look here, sir, you have to be 14 or younger to get a kid's meal. 
 I've just been made day manager, and I didn't get that title by handing out discounted meals. 
 Look, you don't have to be a kid to get a kid's meal, okay? 
 Do you have to be a Evander Holyfield to get the champ? 
 Okay, do you have to be f*cking Chubby Checker to get the Chubby Decker? 
 Do you need to have a long foot to... that one doesn't translate, but you know... this is ridiculous, okay? 
 Can I just please get a kid's meal? 
 Can I get a cup for water? 
 Sure. Here you are. 
 Thank you. 
 Have a good day. 
 Next.

You only get paid a commission, though, right? (scoffs) You might as well sell drugs. Yeah. How do you make money? I sell drugs. It's lucrative. Yeah, man, it's easy. People are addicted to them. Mm-hmm. Sell it till you get rich. How else you pay for studio time, clothes, videos, and weed without a lame-ass job? Yeah, but, you know, you're more famous now. Your profile's risen, which means more risk, you know? You can't go to jail, man. We'll be careful out there, man. Out where? Highway. Got to see the Mexicans. Going to see the Migos. You know I'm going strapped. (blows) (muted TV sounds in background) Yeah, well just... just try not to die. Every day. Yeah, just so y'all know, there's probably a bullet in here somewhere. Noted. (hip-hop plays in background) (door opening) Hey, what's up? Hey, what's up? All right, honey, time to go to bed. Hi. No, don't get up. I wouldn't want you to have to pick up Lottie and ruin all that you're doing. I just got here. I thought you were gonna pick her up today, right? Is it really that hard to help me out every once in a while? I even have to take her to your parents' place myself. Really, Earn? Is this about having to bail me out? Please, you really think you're the first boy I've bailed out of jail? Yeah. Earn : I was working at Al's all day. Yeah? You smell like work. What is that? Kush? Super Jack. Nigga, don't. Don't what? Be happy? I never ride you for you doing what you want to do with your life. No, you roll your eyes at me and you call me crazy any time I try to tell you something. I guess that's just me, right? I'm crazy-ass Vanessa. (exhales sharply) Whatever. I've been inconsiderate. I get it. I'm sorry. What are you doing tomorrow? I want to take you to dinner. No, it's too late. It's too late? Yeah, you messed up. Can I buy you dinner and watch you eat it from across the room? You know, I can get one of those corny niggas to eat it with you. I know you love them. "Oh, I love your energy. My dreads are in a bun. Hey, have you heard any music from the '90s?" You know what? "It's all amazing." You're lucky that I like corny-ass dudes. Mm-hmm. Talking about you. Why are you always turning me into the angry black woman? 'Cause you are. Are you kidding me? I'm the stereotype? Mm-hmm. While your ass, you can't even take care of your own goddamn kid? I'm fine with being a stereotype. It's working out great for me. Really? Yeah, obviously I'm in a bed and I'm technically homeless. It's pretty great. (laughing) I don't know about all that. It was a hard day. (sniffing) You like it. I love it. (chuckles) (groans) Come on, dog. How are you broke on payday? What are you, "12 Years a Slave"? Yeah, my name is "12 Years a Slave." The slave. Shut up, nigga. You don't know his name. I gotta take Van out on this date. And then the math of the money I need for the week, including this MARTA card, I only have $62 left over. Yo, yo, yo, $62 is plenty enough to go on a date, man. Well, you... hey, you know what? Take her out to the Indigo Lounge. What's that? It's a little spot in mid-town I go to. Taking a couple of my hos. (chuckles) You know, the ones I really like, like Eve and Jessica. Yeah, dog. It is nice in there. And, you know the best part about it? They got the happy hour menu popping all night after 7:00. Word? Yeah. It's nice in there, man. You'll like it, dog. Drinks be like five bucks. Should go check it out, bro. A'ight. Bet. I'll talk to you later. Yes, sir. Hand dog out. Yo, I know you was not just listening to my conversation. Girl, you are some mess. sh1t, I might just win tonight. Man : Hey, man. It's gonna be quick, a'ight? Don't let Earn spook you and sh1t. Spook me? Mm-hmm. Man, I ain't scared of nothing. I got Daddy right here. (hip-hop playing) You call your gun "Daddy"? Yes. That's weird, man. Is it weird when your girl call you "Daddy"? Man, that's completely different, and yes, yes. It is. All right, what about Papi? I know you ain't got no problem with Papi. Man, Papi, that's like... cultural. Oh. Oh, okay. Because it's Spanish, now all the sudden, it's sexy. Look, that sh1t always creepy. Man, if a bitch called me "Daddy," man, something wrong happened. Real talk. Yo, you not gonna see this, but your assumed perversion of the word "Daddy," I think that's stemming from the fear of mortality, man. What you call your gun? Nigga, gun. (phone vibrates) Hold on. Ah, it's on. 9:00 tonight. (trills) (laughs) Let's do it. I'm gonna handcuff the briefcase to my wrist. Why? 'Cause it's professional, nigga. We ain't no duffel bag boys. Okay. I don't... see any parking here. I don't know. This is kind of a weird street. No, no, it's good. I think we should just valet. No, no, I'll find street parking, okay? Patience. Patience, young Vanessa. (mellow hip-hop plays) Ah, see? Perfect. Wait, here? Yeah. No, I don't think so. Come on, it'll be fun. Oh. Oh, no. There we go. I don't know. Why don't you go ahead and park it right here, young blood? Don't... don't be scared, darling. Just smellin' hard work on me. That's all. Oh, I know. I know. No, you're fine till midnight. Uh, you guys close at midnight? Uh, no, no, sir. Street gang. They... they like out come out at around 11:00, vandalize the cars and joyride 'em. Not a large cop presence around here, huh? Well, no, but the towing companies. But don't worry about getting towed, 'cause like I said, I'm out here. You see these five cars, right? These my people. And if you eat over there at that restaurant over there, I'll come over there and let you know if you gotta move it real quick. Okay, I'm sorry, but, like, what kind of a parking lot is this? Because it seems janky as hell. No, no, it ain't no parking lot. No, I found this vest over there at the Kroger shopping center. And this here is a lightsaber. Luke Skywalker. How much... how much is it? Uh, $10. That's how much the valet costs. Well, $8. Oh, uh-uh. Earn, you are taking my car to valet right now. I'm sorry, this is ridiculous. I'm sorry. $6. Good night. I'm sorry. Come on, now. Hey, we all we got. Hey, come on. Earn : $6 isn't bad. Hey! (funky pop plays) I'm gonna hit it, man. both : ♪ Your ♪ I'm gonna hit that one. both : ♪ Good love ♪

What? Yeah, we got a new owner from New Orleans. He's kind of changing it up. We do mostly seafood now. Not the tapas and stuff, but it's really good. Well, I think I'm gonna start with a drink. Okay. Um, I was looking at the Bayou Breeze, but what do you think? Should I get that or the wine? Definitely the Bayou Breeze. It's my favorite. Okay, okay. It's a house special, yeah. Um, what are your soups of the day? We have Aunt Zora's seafood soup. It has a lot in it. Like fish, crab, mussels, squid. $28. Do you have anything else? No, that's the only soup we offer. No, that sounds really good. It's so good. You're gonna love it. Well, I was think... You know, the shrimp puffs go really great with that soup. I'm gonna throw in an order of those, too. For free? (laughter) You can share them with her. Yeah. It'll be a good idea. We can share. We'll share them. Can I get you something to drink? Uh, tap water's fine. Earn, I can't drink by myself. Do you have a Miller High Life? Like the ones in the can? (chuckles) We got a hipster. (laughter) Yeah. Okay. Do you know what you want for your entree, Miss? I'm actually not sure. What do you think about the catfish filet? Well, it's okay, but actually tonight, we have a special grilled scallop and lobster meal. It's incredible. You guys seem like you're having a special night. That meal would be perfect. That sounds really good. It's market price. That means it's fresh. It's really fresh. Yeah, I'm gonna have that. Okay, great. I will be right back with those drinks. Okay, thank you. Thank you. Who are you texting? Nothing, no one. What? Oh, you're doing that weird sad boy face you get sometimes. That's just my face. I have to look like that. What, um... how... how's work? Actually, oh, my God, it has been crazy. Did I tell you about that girl, Janine, last week? She was sniffing Wite-Out in my class. Yeah, I think... I want to hear about this, but I have to check on one thing, one thing. Hey, could you ring up my order and tell me how much I'm spending? I just got something that's market price. Wow. Broke as f*ck, my nigga. Yes. (man sobbing) Please, y'all. Come on. (whispers) Did you check your shoes? Why the f*ck would the key be in my shoes? Stop being scary, nigga. Figure it out. You know what, Marcus? I'ma let you go. (whimpering) You know my son, man. Please don't, man. Start heading that way, man. It's all good. You'll find the city. No. (whimpering) sh1t. (whimpering) Ah, sh1t. sh1t, sh1t, sh1t. Oh, sh1t, sh1t. Oh, sh1t. Hand me Percy over there. No, no, no. No, no, no. sh1t. sh1t, sh1t, sh1t, sh1t, sh1t. (gunshot) (gunshot) ♪ Gang, gang, gang, gang gang ♪ Hmm. ♪ Diamonds on my neck, my chain swanging ♪ Did you check your jacket? (exhales) Yeah, man. I just think we need a chance as humans to... fail in order to discover what actually works, you know? People don't think there's a process to being happy. (soft dinner music plays) So what do you want? I don't know. I mean, I guess I just want a chance to find out. Who doesn't? Mm. I get the whole "follow your dreams" thing, but, um, our daughter needs all the tools to survive, and... that includes you, Earn. ♪ ♪ I'm gonna go to the bathroom. Uh-oh. Does she need a brownie sundae? We'll just take the check. How about I go get the dessert menu, and I'll come back and we can... Just get us the check and stop trying to upsell me on sh1t. You're killing me tonight. You've been f*cking killing me. Okay. (dinner music continues) (breathes) f*ck... So, Al, tell me how you disappeared and then show up out the blue with this big-ass order, man. Man, you know I'm rapping, man. It ain't been that long now. Rapping? You just got arrested, dog. No. Uh, I didn't... (scoffs) No, man. Arrested? For murder. You was locked up for murder, right? Now you back? Man, that's kinda fast, dog. Man, he nervous as hell. Look at him. He's shaking. Well, it's a drug deal, so it's total vibes. Yo, yo, are we gonna... we gonna do business or like... (phone vibrating) You gonna answer that? (continues vibrating) Put that m*therf*cker on speakerphone too, man. (clears throat) Hello, cousin. How are you today? Listen, man, can you do me a huge favor and put $20 in my account, like, transfer it over ASAP, like, you gotta help me out, man. All right. Really? (exhales/laughs) Thanks, man, you... you're saving my ass. Okay, man, well, you know I gotta go now. Okay, cool. So, what are you guys doing right now? You and Darius do that deal? Do not know what you mean. The ones with the Mexicans, you guys had the guns. You guys were, like, "We ain't scared of you guys," you said. Yo, okay, man, all right, nigga. Sending money. All right, peace out. Man... (stammering) Good guy. He's legit. With all that, yeah. He's cool. Why didn't you tell him... Stop talking, man. It's weird that your card didn't work the first two times they swiped it. Yeah... (exhales) let's go. Wait, wait, wait. You're not tipping her? Come on, it's not enough that she makes less than you because you got a dick? Have some class. No, I'm just here to see... Mr. Fogle, they towing your car. Come on. Come on. Hey, man, my bad for all of them guns, man. You know, we had to make sure you was straight. We heard some weird sh1t about you, man. (door opens) Hey, sorry I'm late. Paper Boi, right? I'll f*ck with that postal mixtape. (laughing) All right, man. Okay. (laughing) Yeah. Yeah, all right. Who dat? That's my cousin, Tanqueray. I told you we rap now, right? No, word? Yeah, he good, but he talks a lot, you know, he crazy. But anyway, let's settle this deal. Let's get it handled. Okay. Well, it's in the briefcase. Uh, but I-I left the key at home. So... kinda stuck. We can solve that. See? We'll just take the money and y'all get to keep the briefcase. It's easy. Cool. We see y'all. All righty. Hey, yo, what'd you call ya'll group, man? We the Migos. Yeah. That Four Migos. We're inseparable. (chuckles) (crickets chirp, owl hoots) (inhales deeply) Man, that nigga look like he gonna die tonight. There is a security job at the office building, so you could save for a car, and then you wouldn't have to take our daughter on the bus with weirdos. I'm gonna become somebody I hate at a job like that. Well, you're doing that already. You know, being a rapper is something that a high school kid wants to do. Unlike opening a fashion boutique, which is super unique. I know I have a daughter. And I know she deserves the best. But I don't think I have to compromise what I want out of life to do that. Especially if I think it's gonna provide for her. You know me, Van. I can do this. I just gotta do it my way. And if you can't do this out of love for me... do this out of love for her. That's some dumb sh1t. That's some dumb-ass sh1t, Earn. (sighs) I'd like to report a debit card stolen. Mm-hmm. Oh, champagne's the worst. (Migos "Spray the Champagne" playing)
