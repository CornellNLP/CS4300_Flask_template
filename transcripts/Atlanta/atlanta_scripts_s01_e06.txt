It smells good. I'm sorry I'm late. No, no, no. I know you're a working girl. Don't worry, it's fine. [giggles] It's good to see you. You look really good. Oh, thank you. You too. Mhm. Yeah, I like your hair. Really? Yeah, yeah, it's cute. Thanks. Looks better than the last time. Did you go to that shop I told you to go to? Fernando's? No. I went to this place that I found in Midtown. Yeah, you should've went to Fernando's. Girl, I'm telling you, he's the best. He's the best. He will fix those roots. Hmm. Mm-hmm. - How much does Fernando charge? Oh, well, he ain't cheap. Okay. Well, who's paying for yours? Because I actually have to pay for mine. Van, come on. Come on. I don't know if you remember... Okay. what that's actually like. Okay, okay. Good evening, ladies. Can I get you anything else to drink? Yeah, actually, I would like some wine maybe. Like a Chardonnay. Why don't we do, like, a bottle of something? Do you have something sweet? Riesling's good. Okay, yeah. Let's do a bottle of that. Van, good? Great. Okay. Are you two ready to order? Yeah, um... I mean, I am, if you are. Yeah, it's fine. I just didn't want to hold us up. No, it's fine, don't worry about it, go ahead. I'm gonna have the pad Thai with chicken. Excellent. Okay. And, um, I'll go ahead and do the snapper and snake bean salad. Great choice. Yup, great. Thanks. Be right back. Thank you. Oh, Van. [both laugh] I'm so glad I got to catch you. Yeah, I know. I know. When do you leave tomorrow? 9:00. Oh. Yeah. Damn, that's a short trip. When did you get in? You got in, what, yesterday? No, day before yesterday. You flew Delta? No, private. Oh. [laughs] I mean, yeah. Yeah, but it wasn't, like, the nice P.J., it was like those rent-a-P.J.'s. I'm leaving on Delta, though. Oh. Mm-hmm. Where you gonna go? You gonna go home? Uh, no... well, back to New York, check out this apartment I like and then to London. London? Yep. Wow. Yeah. And you're gonna go with a friend, or... No, just a special NBA player friend. Okay. I got it, but it's not the same NBA player... Oh, no, girl. That you're visiting here? No, mm-mm, no. Mm-hmm. I mean, London's okay, I guess. Just too much rain. Makes my hair frizzy. Oh, but I love Paris. Girl, have you been? I went last month. Look, let me show you. Okay, look, look. There I go in Versailles, looking like... looking like black Marie Antoinette. [laughs] It's beautiful. Yeah. You look beautiful. You know, you should come with me next time. Girl. It'll be fun. It'll be fun! I have a daughter. I can't leave. Oh. That's cute. You know, sometimes I wish I had a kid, but then I'm like, ugh, God no. You know, I guess when the time is right, I'll have a kid. Yeah, I'm sure. I'm sure as soon as you find the right guy. ♪ ♪ Yeah, the right guy. Mm-hmm. I guess. So how have you been? So, how's your mom? Sorry. I'm sorry. You go, I'm sorry. How've you been? I haven't seen you. I'm, um, I'm busy. Yeah? I'm busy. I'm good. Well, you look great. You do, I'm serious. Thank you. Oh, I ran into Kerry Clopton. You remember her, from fifth grade? Yeah. You know, the girl. She look like she got a rake dragged across her face. [laughs] On Facebook, it said she was in a car accident. ♪ ♪ Here we are. You know, can I actually get some chopsticks when you get a chance? Um... Of course. Yeah, I don't think we got any. Chopsticks? What? Thai people don't use chopsticks. [laughs] I mean, well, Americans think they do because they're Asian, but they don't. I just like chopsticks. Oh, okay. Okay. So what are you doing after this? This dude I know, he's having some, like, listening party... It sounds cool, but I can't. I have Lottie. Oh, come on, Grandma. Come on, it'll be fun. I also have work in the morning. Yeah, and I have a flight. Look, call Earn... I'm not calling Earn. And then have... why? I don't know, he's busy. Yeah, I see his Snapchat sometimes, and he looks... he looks busy. Wait, are you... are you still seeing him? We have a daughter. I mean, I still go out, but... Is he living with you? When he can afford to, yes. Mmm. [giggles] Y'all are funny. You two are funny. [laughs] Oh, okay. I mean, you used to make fun of girls like you. You realize that, right? No, I'm serious, Van. You know, you really need to think about your value. I'm sorry? Like, what is your value? Wait, what are you asking me right now? Like, why are you messing around with this broke-ass nigga? Like, you... Whatever. Van. I know what my worth is. I don't want to be out here dating a million football players... that's your style. Hey, hey, look. Women need to be valuable. Black women have to be valuable. Come on, the NBA players that I f*ck with, they f*ck with me because I provide a service, and I am worth it. I am cultured, intelligent, and beautiful. And that is hard... Van! Look at me. That is hard to come by. That kind of black and white mentality might work for you, but for those of us who don't live on whether a linebacker swipes left or right... That's not what I'm talking. On my goddamn ass, then there's a gray area. Stop, Van, he's running around on you, girl. Oh, so what? What you mean, "So what"? So what? You don't think that I'm going out on dates? You don't think that I'm running around? You don't think that I ever decline his calls because I have some guy wrapped around me with his tongue down my throat? I mean, come on! Really?

I wanted to have a quick chat with you. Um, didn't receive your sample... I smoked weed. Okay. Well, urine samples aren't sent off. The county can't afford quarterly drug tests for its employees, so after the first one, they're really just to keep people on their toes. Listen, everybody smokes weed. The system isn't made for these kids to succeed, and you got to shake it off somehow. I get it. [sighs] But unfortunately, you have admitted the use of an illegal substance to a superior, so I've got to fire you. To cover my own ass, as well as the school's. You understand. Okay, let's say we had this conversation Friday. That'll give you the week to get your things together, okay? You all right? Come here. Yeah, you are. Whoo! You are loud.
