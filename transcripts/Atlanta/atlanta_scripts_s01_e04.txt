 [hip-hop music over speakers] 
 Damn, man. It's hot as hell in there. 
 Don't be breaks, man. 
 You know, we could, um... 
 We could do some instrumental sh1t, you know, like a Kendrick album. 
 I know the recorder a little bit, so, like, we could do a song like "Pussy Relevance." 
 You can come in like... 
 ♪ Pussy relevance ♪ 
 Both : ♪ So intelligent ♪ 
 And then I can come in like... 
 ♪ Do, do-do-do, do, do ♪ 
♪ Do-do-do-do-do, do, do, do ♪ 
♪ Do-do-do, do, do ♪ 
 And you can be like, "Bye, everybody," 
 Like, "I'm gonna take a break."

 'Sup, guys? I'm Zan. 
 Hey! Paper Boi. 
 Good sh1t, homey. 
 You blowing up right now, my nigga. 
 Yeah, I don't know you. 
 But I'm still your nigga, believe me.

 Of course I am. 
 You want a hat, Paper Boi? 
 Nah, we're... We're good, man. 
 All right. 
 Peep this. 
 [phone clicks] 
 Is that a meme depicting what happens to you or to bae when they scroll through the DMs? 
 Man, whatever. 
 I got those likes. 
 Guess who saw someone throw up on the booth. 
 Hey! 
 Back the f*ck off Paper Boi, man! 
 The f*ck, man? 
 Whoa. 
 Oh. My bad. 
 Is this your boy? 
 'Sup, man. I'm Zan. 
 You want a hat?

 Yeah. 
 Right on. 
 Let me get one for the 'gram. 
 [hoverboard whirring] 
 Oh, yeah.

 And one more for Snapchat. 
 All right, man. That's enough. 
 What? Are you sure? 
 I'm a photographer, man. 
 I took this. 
 Oh, it's your face next to a butt. 
 Wait, I forget. What's your email? 
 I never gave it to you. 
 It's cool, just... just take my phone number, man. 
 Yeah, yeah, I'll text you mine.

Thursday's made up. Niggas stay woke. Hey, man. That dude from last night talking sh1t. What? "Paper Boi, who getting a lot of hype in the streets for a possible involvement with a murder, is, how you say, not as talented as people think." That's a weird... sentence. [keys clacking rapidly] Right, uh, you ready to go? Yeah. Oh, also, is it okay if I spend the night over here again? Wayne. [hisses] [cell phones ding] Damn, bro, you going off, ain't you? [keys clacking] Yep. Yeah, man. Don't bait this dude. You'll just make it worse. [keys clacking] Hey! [light thud] You're gonna make it worse! [keys clacking] AIDS was invented to keep Wilt Chamberlain from beating Steve McQueen's s*x record. You know, by '69, he was already number three on the all-time list. But '71, he would have beat that boy for sure. I thought AIDS was made by the government to kill homosexuals. Oh, yeah, that too, I mean, but... Two for one. Mm-hmm. Who's Steve McQueen? [scoffs] The actor, man. You know. The King of Cool. You know, guy from "The Sand Pebbles." I don't know. Man, most black people don't know who Steve McQueen is. Really? Yeah, but I thought, you know, that you'd be into that kind of stuff, but guess not. But you know who Steve McQueen is, though. Yeah, well, I'm Nigerian. Okay. [hip-hop music] Yo, man, the club, it's so lit, it's so lit up in here. Yo, how you feeling? Lit! Ooh! Yeah! [Twitter app whistles] [jazzy music] Ah, recording all night really paid off. Oh, look, I found all my mixtapes. Let's put 'em back where they belong. [gas pump clicks] [store entrance bell chimes] [relaxed music over radio] How much can I get for this gun? I need to get a copy of your driver's license first. That makes sense. All right, I'll see you. Good luck. ♪ ♪ Yeah, what's up? Yeah, um, I got this phone, it's new. I want to see how much I could get for it. I got to ask my boss. Cool. Uh, is it cool if I have... I have something of yours while you have something of mine like, like a driver's license or something like that, just... [samurai sword resounds] No. Earn. Yeah? Earn! Yeah? What? Get this sword. Why? We could trade up on it. We get you a lot more money. ♪ ♪ I really need this, man. Well, if you need the money, take the money. I'm just saying I can get you more. ♪ ♪ $190. Actually, let me get this sword, man. You want to swap it out? Yeah, I want to swap it out. ♪ ♪ Hey, you know who Steve McQueen is? Yeah. Would you know who Steve McQueen was if you didn't work here? Black people don't know who Steve McQueen is. I keep that there for protection. If some dude come in here asking about that poster, I know he trying to get me to turn around so he can rob me. Sign this. ♪ ♪ Get you a receipt. Thank you. I wasn't trying to... rob you. [hip-hop music] 'Sup, guys? It's your boy, Zan, with another mixtape review.

There's already a rapper Paperboy. He had that song "Ditty." Or how about this Paper Boi? Also this Papuh Boi too. I mean, how am I supposed to spell "failure" when you're taking all the Ls? ♪ Paper Boi, Paper Boi ♪ 
♪ Always 'bout that paper, boy ♪ This Paper Boi is hot. This is the problem with rap right now, man. Every nigga can't sell drugs, just like every nigga can't rap. But when you're out here and you can't do both, what the f*ck are you doing, bro? [somber rock music] I mean, really? ♪ ♪ He is kind of funny. What's his Twitter handle? Man, shut up. You told me to watch it. ♪ ♪ Yo, is this nigga Indian? I don't like Indian dudes who say "nigga." [pool balls clacking, ball thuds] It's just the Internet. It doesn't matter. Man, he out here saying I can't rap and I don't move. Man, that's disrespect. You don't want people to know you move. Trust me. I don't, man, but I can't have people out here talking sh1t. He messin' with my actual business, my life. He don't even know what he talkin' about, man. Nobody checking his credentials. Why he get to attack mine? sh1t. ♪ You walked into my life ♪ He's one of these misguided niggas who loves hip-hop. No, he don't, man. He out here selling T-shirts. He exploiting it. What he look like? [inhales] [scoffs] I mean, is he Dominican, man? Like... Somebody was in here looking for you today, waiting when I opened. Really? This dude? No, he wasn't Dominican, I don't think. But he was different. Shaved side of his head. Pink jacket. And he wasn't a friend. Sitting in his car when I opened up. Dodge Challenger, '70s, tan.

He used to come down to the old place. Word? In fact, I think I know where he works. ♪ ♪ No. [hip-hop bass thuds] ♪ ♪ Do you know if you can block someone on a flip phone? Why? 'Cause that dude Zan keeps mass-texting me every party in Atlanta and he keeps calling them "movements" and I f*cking hate him. Hmm. Wasn't that dude, like, half Chinese or something? I don't know. Probably. He was pretty short. Ni-i-ice! Chinese people are short 'cause of Genghis Khan. Look it up. In what? "The Racism Book"? [Keith Ape's "It G MA Remix" playing over speaker] Look, this dude killed enough people to lower the temperature on Earth. And if he conquered you and you were bigger than this wheel he had, crrk, he'd kill you. Is that true? You don't think that had an effect genetically? Plus, Chinese people don't like black people no way. Look it up. Again, where? And he's not Chinese. I'm not Chinese.

I'm getting tired of niggas online harassing me. Ah, fan engagement. No, man, you messin' with my life, man. This my job. Helping us get money, though. Nigga! There's no money anywhere near rap. Now, I know it look fun and games on The Shade Room, but... niggas die. People are forgotten. sh1t is real. Yo, can I use that? Use what, man? What you just said. Like, if I was recording this, could I use that? Nigga, are you recording me right now? I record everything, man. Everything's valuable to someone. Okay, so then you admit it. You ain't no critic or a photographer. You... you like a salesman or something. What's the difference? I mean, it's all the game. We're all just hustling. You too. 'Cause I have to. I scare people at ATMs, boy. So I have to rap. I mean, that's what rap is... Making the best out of a bad situation, brother. Right. You're exploiting your situation. What? You're exploiting your situation to make rap, and I'm exploiting you exploiting that. Money, bro. [exhales] Whatever, man. I, like...
