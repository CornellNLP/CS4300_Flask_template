 I know you're Tara. You're Tara.     
 I just... (CHUCKLES)     
 You remind me of this girl named Regina I went to high school with.     
 Every time I see you, I'm like, "Tara's not Regina."

 They're driving to Florida right now to visit my uncle who's dying.     
 Oh, Florida, huh?     
 Better make sure you tell them to watch out for Florida Man.     
 What's Florida Man?     
 DARIUS:  Florida Man is responsible for a large percentage of abnormal incidents that occur in Florida.   
 Think of him as a... alt-right Johnny Appleseed.   
 No one knows his true identity, date of birth, what he looks like.   
 That's why headlines always say, "Florida Man."   
 "Florida Man shoots unarmed black teenager."   
 (GUNSHOT)     
 "Florida Man bursts into ex's delivery room, and fights new boyfriend as she's giving birth."   
 "Florida Man steals a car, goes to Checkers."   
 MAN: Fries!     
 "Florida Man beats a flamingo to death."   
 "Florida Man found eating another man's face."   
 - No. No. 
- Yes.     
 - Yes, it's true. 
- No.     
 Him, the state government, f*cking cahoots.     
 Why would anyone even do that? (CHUCKLES)     
 To prevent black people from coming to and/or registering to vote in Florida, Earn. Come on.     
 - Of course. 
- Yeah.     
 You want to turn the music back on?     
 - Yeah, sure. 
- Yeah.

 Earnest Marks. First-time offender.     
 Narcotics possession with intent to sell?     
 Um, half a joint.     
 Plus they said the charge don't even count, as long as I don't get charged again.     
 Unless you get arrested again, not charged.     
 One's easier than the other.     
 You've already paid your entrance fee.     
 Yeah, my jail entrance fee. (LAUGHS)     
 We'll need $   for the mandatory anti-drug class materials and each class is $  , so that's...     
 $    plus the $  ,     
 $    in total. Are you able to pay this amount at this time?     
 No.     
 A payment plan will be set up for the remainder of your classes.     
 Please pay promptly, or a warrant will be issued for your arrest.     
 Would I even have to show up for these classes if I paid for the whole thing in full?     
 You can't, so let's not.     
 Take one of those cups by the door, fill it up and leave it in the cupboard.     
 Yes. Thank you.

 If you're trying to arrest me, you got to get a complaint from her, and then it's got to be filled out and signed.     
 - That's how the law works. 
- No, sir.     
 That's not how it works.     
 Comply or we will put you in cuffs.     
 Put me in what?     
 Willy, you-you-you better go on and talk to them.     
 WILLY: I'm not talking to these sons of bitches about nothing 'cause I ain't do nothing.     
 And if they keep on trying to act like they're gonna come in here and get me, then I'll let that alligator loose and see what they do about that.

 I'm not Florida Man.     
 I just know the law.     
 As long as I didn't do sh1t, all I got to do is stay in my house.     
 Look, I don't know if you're high right now, but you're getting on my last nerve.

 You better hope they do.

 Really, man? Huh?     
 What are you wilin' out for?

 Now they don't even talk no more.

 No, that's not it.
