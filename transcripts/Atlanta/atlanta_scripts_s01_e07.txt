 ♪ ♪ Good evening, and welcome to "Montague". I'm your host, Franklin Montague. And today we're gonna take a look at the growing outlook of accepted sexuality and its effects on black youth and culture. With us today, we have the Head of the Center of Trans-American issues, Dr. Debra Holt, and recording artist Paper Boi. Good evening to you both. Good evening, Montague. 'Sup? Uh, let's start at the beginning. Paper Boi, last Tuesday you engaged in a Twitter rant that had some pretty inflammatory statements. But the one statement that seems to have made the biggest impact was this one... [sighs] and I quote, "Y'all the..." N-words "who said I was weird for not wanting to" F-word "Caitlyn Jenner." Would you want to, uh, explain that statement? No. Well, could you explain that statement? [blows] I... meant what I said. You don't think your tweets are transphobic? I just don't have to have s*x with Caitlyn Jenner 'cause y'all say so. Mm. So you don't think Caitlyn Jenner's important? [tsks] Look, I get what y'all saying, right? But she's not super important to me, like, not my life. So how long have you disliked transpeople? Man, look, I just found out they exist, to be honest. I... no, no... "I make her switch sides, Caitlyn Jenner in reverse"? Is that not a... a lyric of yours? Man, I was just rapping, man. Look, I've said worse things. You ever heard my song, "Illuminati s*x"? Haven't heard it yet. Well, there we go then. Debra, you've... written about this current phenomenon in your book, "Transition: Gender in a New Generation." What do you think about all this? I look at these statements as natural consequences of a culture of exclusion and power. Mm. You know, there's... there's a large swath of... [scoffs] gender and sexuality roles that are just being exposed to a large portion of the public. [chuckling] Uh, it's harder for certain sections to deal with this transition uh, because of conflict of interest, and, frankly, identity issues. In this case, the rap community. Now, I truly believe it's, uh, has more to do with issues of masculinity in the black community than actual homophobia or... or transphobia. Please explain. Yes, please, please. Tell me... tell me about myself. Go on. Well, Mis... Mister, uh, Pa... Mr. Paper Boi... Mister, yeah. What would you consider yourself? A rapper? A straight rapper? Hell yeah. Well, I did some research on your lyrics, and they're actually very pro sexual-spectrum. Oh? Pro-what? "If I eff with you, you my N-word, you my N-word for life." Yo... you know that ain't what I meant. Yeah, oh, I understand, but, you know, there's a layer of fluidity... No, no, no. There's no extra layer. That you yourself don't even realize. I don't think about what I'm rapping half the time. Look, I'm just trying to get paid, you feel me? Look, [bleep], why you think I'm on this show? You're not getting paid for this. Hey... hey, Earn... man? Black men aren't ready to accept the implications of a trans-accepting culture. No... look, I'm allowed to say that it's weird. "It"? No, look, I'm not calling him a "it." Naw, I'm just saying that... "Him"? Look... look, can I say something? Damn! All right. Well... it... depends. I was trying to say... We got to take a break. When we're back, we're gonna take a look into a young boy's struggle for equality. [theme music playing] [sighs] [theme music] [sportscaster on phone] [front entrance dings] [Muzak plays in background] ♪ ♪ [sportscasters continue] [beep] $1.49? But the price on the can, though. The price is on the can, though. [crowd cheers on phone] [sportscasters continue] [jazzy lounge music] ♪ ♪ [music continues] ♪ ♪ [upbeat hip-hop instrumental music] The Dodge Charger. Make a statement without saying anything at all. [theme music playing] Earlier in our show, we talked about transitions in sexuality. Uh, but what about race? Our correspondent, Nathan Wielder, has the story. Harrison looks from the outside to be your average teenager. He goes to school, plays video games, even listens to music in his room. But there's one difference. I'm a 35-year-old white man. Harrison, born Antwoine Smalls, has trans-racial identity, identifying as Harrison Booth, a 35-year-old white man from Colorado. And when did you know that you were a 35-year-old white man? Well, I've always felt different. I go to the store, the movies, and just be thinking to myself, like, "Why am I not getting the respect I deserve?" And then, it just hit me. I'm white... and 35. I just miss Colorado sometimes, you know. Here, I pretend the buildings are the old San Juan Mountain ranges but, you know, the jobs is here. And where do you work? I'm a Systems Engineer for Coca-Cola. Oh. Okay. That boy don't work. He go to school, and that's it. Mm-hmm. One day, he said, "Call me Harrison." I said, "Who's that?" He said, "Me." Do you believe that he is a white man? I mean, he isn't. [bleep], I'd love to wake up one day and say, "Hey, everybody, I'm Rihanna." But I ain't. It's been pretty hard. My family just doesn't get it. You know, I try to get them to go out with me, go on walks, go to the farmers market, chat with people, but... yeah. So why don't you think that they get it? I don't think they get it because they don't realize that race is just a made-up thing. Mm-hmm. They grew up having labels, and me, I'm just... I'm just not like that. I see. So how do you embrace your identity? I dress a certain way. Ah. Patagonia. I wear a thick, brown leather belt. I like to envision myself after the surgery. [clears throat] "Hey, excuse me, what IPA do you have on tap?" "Hey, did you see 'Game of Thrones' last night?" Yeah. So your... your surgery, that's later this year? Right. I started working at Stonecrest Mall, so hopefully by then I have enough money to take the next step. Mm-hmm. So you work at Coca-Cola and the mall? Right. Correct, I work at both. [gentle guitar music] Harrison has been planning a full racial transition with a Dr. Samuel Vergara who guarantees Harrison can visually transition through an experimental procedure that will allow Harrison not only to be a white man but whatever race he chooses. The procedure's absolutely 100% possible. He's gonna look weird though. But before Harrison can fully realize his physical identity, he still has the day-to-day that's filled with discrimination and ridicule. It... it's pretty awful, you know. You... you walk in the streets, and black people, they see you, they nod to you like, "Hey, good to see us." And it's to the point where I've just given up. I've stopped trying to convince them that I'm not "us." Gotcha. Hey, excuse me, this is definitely the guy. He doesn't even live in the area. I've never seen him before. [police radio chatter] ♪ ♪ I think we're taking slow strides, but you have to believe things are getting better, otherwise, you'll just die inside. Is there anything you'd like to say to other black kids out there who may be going through the same thing? Just be you. At all costs. But also, stop dressing so crazy. Hmm. [gentle instrumentals] ♪ ♪ [guitar music flourishes] Absolutely. Hi. I'm Devyonne Johnson, famous movie star. When the director calls cut and I get a quick five, you know I'm reaching for the smooth taste of Swisher Sweets. Swisher Sweets are the only cigarillos  made with the highest quality tobacco from family-owned farms. It's their high standards and experience that make for a quality smoke you can enjoy every time. [inhales] [click] ♪ ♪ [blows] Yeah... [chuckles] I only smoke Swisher Sweets. It's the smooth taste. The Swisher Sweets is good as hell. Here, make sure this one's empty. Swisher Sweets. There's just something about 'em. And try our new pre-dumps Swisher Sweets as well. [mellow jazz music] [theme music playing] And we're back. And today we're talking about transitions with my guests, Atlanta rapper Paper Boi and Dr. Debra Holt. Ah, Paper Boi, are you afraid to speak your mind on this subject? Actually, yup, I am. You can't say real [bleep] anymore without somebody trying to make sure you never make money... So you think you're being persecuted? Yes, I am. Man, you can't even say "ho" in a song no more. [scoffs] A travesty, I'm sure. [chuckles] Yo, why you... Yo, why you talk like that? Like, "a travesty, I'm sur..." like, what? You're... you're whining about chickens coming home to roost. No-no-no-no-no. Rap is chickens coming home to roost. Look, my life is messed up from [bleep] y'all did, okay? That's black news. You can look that up. Well, your news is problematic. Bitch, that ain't my fault! Whoa, whoa, whoa! I won't have you on my show calling anyone "bitches." How you gonna blame me for news being bad, huh? All right, simmer down, simmer down. You can't even have an intelligent dialogue without spewing profanities. [groans] It's... it's ludicrous. Okay, okay, okay. Paper Boi, isn't a lack of a father the reason you hate transpeople? What? Lack of a father? Man, you hear yourself? [bleep], shut up. Man, here's the thing. Man, I... it's hard for me to care about this when nobody cares about me as a black human man, you feel me? Like, Caitlyn Jenner is just doing what rich white men been doing since the dawn of time, which is whatever the hell he want. So why should I care? What make him so special? But... but as a black man in this country, shouldn't you care about the civil liberties of others, since they're so closely related to... Mm. to your struggle for equality? What you talking 'bout? I do care. Look, I don't have a problem with gay people, transpeople, because that's tolerance, but where's tolerance for people like me? You know what I'm saying? Like... [sighs] Look. I should be able to say something is weird without people hating on me. All right? Look, I never... I never said anything about taking away nobody's rights. A'ight? Never. I... I understand what you're saying, but... but some people found your remarks offensive. Yeah, well, freedom of speech, [bleep]. No, you're right. I agree. But your music is detrimental to black teens. [scoffs] Yeah, but so is all rap music, right? I mean, and rock music... Rock. Before it was taken over by rap. Yeah, I agree. You hate... women! [bleep] what? 
 
 [theme music playing] Questions The universe. Paternity tests? Salutations. [gentle music] Hi. My name is Ahmad White. You may know me from your dreams. Call this number below and get the answers you deserve. [upbeat music] When I called Ahmad White, I was three months behind on my car loan. [scoffs] My stepson, he was in jail. My life was in shambles! But now, I got a truck, I got a girlfriend, I got the answers I deserve. Thank you, Ahmad White. Most people don't realize their chakra's in another universe. Don't be dumb. Call now. Me and Ahmad found out I was a moon sign, and I wasn't getting enough crystal in my diet. Now, I live in a beautiful home. Ahmad gave me the answers I was looking for. Come to our Liberty Center and get a free juice and Nutella sandwich. When I called Ahmad, my life was going nowhere fast. After a Nutella sandwich and juice, my life's a lot better. [upbeat tone sustained] Open your third eye. He works. He just works. He works. He really works. He works. He really, really works. Knowledge is the path to greatness. If you'd like to be smart as a baby dolphin, call now. [ethereal music] [upbeat hip-hop instrumental music] [engine revs] That's a nice car. You know him? That's Victor Wallace. His wife left him for his brother. Long court battle. Kids, house... it got messy. He ain't say one word the whole trial. But then at the end, he just stood up and said, "Leave me my Dodge Charger." He been driving around this neighborhood in circles for a week. Just waving. Mm. Nice car though. [nozzle fumbling] [upbeat hip-hop instrumental music] ♪ ♪ [tires screech] ♪ ♪ The Dodge Charger. Keep it in the divorce. [gasps] King Coco's Crunch-O's. The legend is true! [creaking] Gimme that crunch! No! [grunts] Nice try. But only kids can have... all : Coconut Crunch-O's. That chocolatey coconut crunch in every bite. [crunches] Oh, I can almost taste it! Bbbbbb! [train horn whistles] Oh, I got to have them Crunch-O's! [grunts] Ow! Ow! [groans] Stop resisting. [pained groans] Stop resisting, sir. [pained struggle] Stop... resisting. Oh! Mother... [grunts] Stay down. [handcuffs click] What happened? He's going to jail. That's what happened. This is some bullshit! You all right? He's fine. He just doesn't wanna go to jail. You sitting on my back, man! [bones crack] Ah! Sir, be quiet. Yo! You sitting on his back! He was trying to steal your cereal, right? I mean, it's just cereal. He can have it! Man, I'm just hungry, man! They don't let wolves in stores, man! Step back, guys. I'm going to lift the offender up. We are now going to our feet, sir. Let's go, sir, let's go. Nigga, I could be eating these kids! But I'm out here eating cereal! Hey, it's cool! We'll just give him the cereal. No, only kids can have Coconut Crunch-O's. You know that. [tsks] That's a wack law. This fool know he eat Coconut Crunch-O's, and you ain't no kid! Let me do my job. I said back up... sir! [brooding dramatic music] [crunches] Coconut Crunch-O's is a part of this balanced breakfast. [theme music playing] Earlier we showed a clip about a young man dealing with trans-racial identity. Well, we've got him joining us via Facebook video chat. Please welcome Antwoine Smalls to the show. Hello, Montague, thank you for having me on your show. So now, Antwoine... [Paper Boi laughs] It's Harrison. I'm sorry. [chuckling] Harrison. How's your life been since we last saw you? Ohh... It's pretty good. I just came back from Charleston, South Carolina. Ah. Beautiful. I was checking out some cheap art spaces for me and a friend that I made, uh... What... wait... I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. Yo. This is dumb. Like, that... this is dumb. What... Like, dude, wait. Wait, did you power up? 'Cause you look like Super Saiyan right now. Like, is that, like, is that the Goku... [sighs] Like Dragon Ball collection [bleep] like? You look like a fake Ellen DeGeneres. This is just... Like a Felon DeGeneres. Okay. Look, no-no-no, you look like Drake Malfoy, dude, like... bangs, my [bleep]? Like, nobody told you not to do bangs... like... Okay, okay. Mr. Boi. Nice tolerance. Mr. Boi. What is up... Wait, wait... Okay, okay, thank you. None of y'all? Okay. Thank you. That is very inappropriate. Sorry, man, go ahead. Shh.  It's... it's okay. Sadly, the black community, they just aren't accepting of racial diversity or anyone different, for that matter. Mm. Now, Harrison... [Paper Boi groans] Would you say that, uh, the... the rap game or the hip-hop community is especially intolerant of the lifestyle you chose? We really can't blame rap or the hip-hop culture. He's just expressing himself to the best of his ability. And I will defend his right to do that. He's telling a story, or, like, views from the streets. You know, like a ghetto news. Mm. Okay. [snickers] But... but Harrison, don't you think that the rap community and its treatment of transpeople and homosexuals is indicative of a larger problem in the black community,  one that makes your lifestyle unacceptable? No, no way. Not at all. I mean, a man wanting to turn himself into a woman... that's just unnatural, and I don't think  we should have our kids thinking that that's okay. So I will support that message. Wait, wait, wait, wait. What are you saying? [stifled laugh] I'm not into gay marriage. That... that is gross. Why would I ever tolerate something like that? Marriage is meant for a man and a woman, not that...  that's an abomination. We're... we... No. How can you say that with the discrimination you were just talking about? I mean, how... It's the truth. What are you, crazy? This [bleep] crazy! That is all the time we have tonight. I'd like to thank my guests... Oh, my God. Dr. Holt, Paper Boi. [Paper Boi chuckling] Please check for her book "Transition," as well as Paper Boi's mixtape "Postal." Yup! Available... wherever mixtapes are available. Good night. [Paper Boi laughing] Like, you look like a dying palm tree. Right? Like you look like the lost fifth Beatle, my [bleep], that they just don't talk about. That, like, power up, like... [indistinct] [bleep] bangs, like... [laughing]. I don't care for it. [theme music playing]
