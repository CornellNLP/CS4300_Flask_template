 Hey, y'all.   
 So, tonight I'm wearing my jasmine brandy lip plump.   
 And y'all can use a discount code to get it,   
 so you can be... mwah... twinkling like your girl here.   
 And what better way to bust it out than a night with my girls?   
 This is my girl Van.   
 Say hi, Van.   
 That's Van.   
 She cute or whatever, and I need a new Netflix password,    
 so hook a girl up. (LAUGHS)    
 All right, bye.    
 No free pictures.    
 Anyway, y'all stay tuned.    
 'Cause tonight the stars are gonna be out.    
 - (CHUCKLES) 
- (STIFLED LAUGHTER)    
 I dropped this phone in the tub with Lottie,    
 and now it just does not hold a charge.    
 Uh-uh, no, we not talking about Lottie,    
 we not talking about children, we talking about liquor,    
 - we talking about...

- Uh-uh.

- Tammi, you keep talking like that,    
 you're gonna have child number two tonight.    
 Uh-uh.    
 - She is. 
- I got an IUD to block them K-I-Ds.    
 - (LAUGHTER) 
- TAMMI: IUD?    
 You know what, though? Them IUDs work.    
 NADINE: You know what? Y'all nasty.    
 'Cause I changed my sh1t up after Lottie.    
 You know what I'm saying?    
 (LAUGHTER)    
 Don't get that copper IUD,    
 - 'cause that makes your periods worse. 
- TAMMI: What?    
 - Wait, no, it does? 
- TAMMI: I'm good.    
 - VAN: Mm-hmm. 
- What ever happened to condoms?    
 Bitch, how old are you?    
 - CANDICE: Really. Damn! 
- You're still using condoms?    
 Are you in high school?    
 - (LAUGHTER) 
- You know what?    
 I don't have kids, and I also don't have HPV, trick.    
 TAMMI (LAUGHING): Oh! Really, y'all gonna play me like that?    
 Put that in your condom and f*ck it.    
 Oh, okay, so DJ said that he's going to meet us    
 and escort us through and everything,    
 so we don't look like groupies.    
 - CANDICE: Mm. 
- (TAMMI LAUGHS)    
 - TAMMI: What the...? 
- You know what?    
 What is your deal with DJ, actually?    
 DJ, girl, that's... He's a tour barber.    
 - He's nothing. 
- So, what, you just stringing him along    
 for an invite to Drake's party?    
 - Mm-hmm. 
- Uh, no, I'm not stringing him along.    
 I actually only talk business with DJ.    
 So, did you send him selfies? Yes or no.    
 I might've sent him one or two selfies. Dang.    
 So you sent him one or two pictures of your breasts.    
 First of all, my breasts are already on Tumblr,    
 so he could've already seen it. And I only sent him    
 - half a nipple... that don't count. 
- NADINE: Oh.    
 Oh, okay, so he would've saw them eventually,    
 because I know you didn't have on no business clothes.    
 Everybody can't be a nun like you, Nadine.    
 If I'm gonna chase anybody, y'all,    
 it's gonna be that Aubrey. Uh!    
 'Cause you know, I've always had a crush on Aubrey.    
 - TAMMI: Uh, you and all the other groupies. 
- NADINE: Aubrey?    
 - TAMMI: What are you talking about? 
- CANDICE: Aubrey.    
 - You don't know him. 
- TAMMI: Girl.    
 (OVERLAPPING CHATTER)    
 - CANDICE: He is fine. 
- Fine.    
 CANDICE: And he looks like he would make a great father.    
 TAMMI: Van! Van, do you hear this madness?    
 What are we... what are y'all talking about?    
 You know what? I don't even care;    
 I need a photo with Drake,    
 because my Instagram is weak as f*ck.    
 - What are you talking about? 
- I'm just being real. My sh1t...    
 - look, I got Lottie, Lottie, Lottie... 
- Chicken.    
 Lottie, me... chicken...    
 I know exactly which one you're talking about...    
 - Uh-huh. 
- Lottie, Lottie, Earn.    
 Delete the Earn.    
 Oh, yeah, so we can replace Earn with Drake.    
 - Right. (GROANS) 
- (LAUGHS)    
 - Y'all really think this dress is okay? 
- Mm-hmm.    
 I think it looks good on you... It's fine.    
 Look, we got to go, okay?    
 Let's have one more shot.    
 NADINE: Do y'all think I should smoke tonight?    
 - Yes! Yes! 
- Yes!    
 Oh, my God!

 You are not a better driver after a few drinks.     
 - I'm a good driver. 
- No, you ain't.     
 - Um, Candice. 
- Next time we smoke and drive.     
 Candi, you sure we in the right place?     
 - Yeah. Yeah, this is it. 
- (MOANS)     
 - There's nobody here. 
- This looks a little sus.     
 No, no, there's gonna be a shuttle that comes.     
 - I'm freezing. 
- I'm losing my buzz.     
 Where is everybody?     
 - Okay, stop complaining. 
- We're in the woods, girl.     
 Follow me. Follow me.     
 Thi-This way. Follow me.     
 Where in the world?     
 You should've wore pants.     
 You should not be down here in this...     
 - Who this nigga? 
- Yo, uh, happy New Year.     
 - Ha-Happy New Year. 
- Right.     
 Hey, y'all going to that Drake theme party, right?     
 I-I got this pizza for him.     
 Like, right here.     
 - Cool. 
- Y'all have the address?     
 Yo, give me the address, y'all can have some,     
 but this pizza has to go inside him.     
 - Oh, oh, the shuttle's over here. 
- He needs it.     
 - What kind of pizza? 
- This is good pizza.     
 Hey, no, we don't want your pizza... bye.     
 Wha... No, no... You got to put me on, though.     
 Put me on... I got music, too.     
 Like, we could... we could work just together.     
 Put me on. You... come on, bruh!     
 Don't leave me out.     
 Don't leave me out...     
 (WHISPERS): It's locked.     
 Uh, hey. We're here for the party.

 Okay, oh, all right, wait, wait, wait, um...

 DJ, next time, can you escort me?     
 Because security was so mean to me.

- Oh, yeah, I want to meet Drake.     
 Uh, yeah, he's-he's floating around somewhere.     
 Well, where's this room?

 You seem annoyed or something.

- No.     
 He's out there living his life and I'm here living mine.     
 I'm just trying to get this photo with Drake.     
 I need to strategize.     
 Is it me? A-Are you mad at me?     
 What? No.     
 You're paranoid. Stop it.

 No, I'm sorry. I...     
 Um, do you know where I can find,     
 like, a water or something non-alcoholic or like...     
 Voilà.     
 Wow. Thank you. (CHUCKLES)     
 You got a bathroom in there, too?

 Yeah. Um...     
 she's pretty high, though, so...

 I know a place downstairs you can charge your phone     
 next to a pretty dope bathroom.

 But how'd you know about his studio down here, then?     
 No, you know... I just, uh...     
 I got here at, like,  :  , so I just walked around.     
 Nobody was here, so...     
 - Checked out the rooms. 
- Uh-huh.

- With your friends?     
 Friends? Nah.     
 But you're my friend.

 Okay. Um... I need to use the bathroom.     
 I'm gonna charge my phone in there.     
 Great. Let me just... let me show you where it is.     
 Okay.     
 Here. Let-let me show you. It's right over here.     
 - Okay. Thank you. 
- Okay.

 Uh, yeah, I'm good.     
 You need anything?

 BRANDON: Okay, some toilet paper or...?     
 Uh, why don't you go get us some weed?     
 BRANDON: Weed, right.     
 Yeah, I can... I can, I can find that.     
 Um, yeah. Uh... are you... are you hungry?     
 You want any food while I'm at it? A d... a drink?     
 - T-Tequila? 
- Um, like, food?     
 Maybe some water.     
 Okay. All right. I'll be right back.

 DARIUS: No.     
 No, it is not.     
 Hmm. Have you heard of Bostrom's simulation argument?     
 No.     
 Basically, it just states that, uh, future civilizations     
 must have immense computing power     
 and that if even a fraction of this     
 were to run ancestral simulation,     
 there's a high probability that it would be indistinguishable     
 from reality to the simulated ancestor, i.e. us.     
 What?     
 You're a simulation.     
 - Oh. 
- Like a Sim.     
 There is someone controlling your every movement.     
 Yeah, I don't even like apples.     
 Can you help me stop thinking?

 Hi?     
 (MAN SPEAKING SPANISH)     
 (WHISPERING): Hi. I'm sorry.     
 Um... I'm lost.

 (SPEAKS SPANISH)     
 Oh. Um... (CHUCKLES)

 ¿El avión?   
 Yo soy su abuelo.   
 Are you Drake's  abuelo?   
 Sí. Abuelo.   
 Oh, my God. You're his grandpa.     
 Sí. Abuelo.  (SPEAKING SPANISH)     
 No. Mm-mm. I don't speak Spanish.     
 No hablas español. 
But it's nice to meet you.     
 (SPEAKING SPANISH)     
 You want me to look at that?     
 Hold up. Drake's not here?

 Oh, how you doing?

 Mm-hmm.     
 The line starts there, sweetie.

 Look, they're real to everyone else.     
 I mean, this your best option, anyway.     
 You thought you was gonna have a meaningful convo with Drake

- Girl, she ain't real.     
 - Come on, cutie. Who next? 
- Hey.     
 Stars are just a projection of what's actually already     
 - inside of your mind. 
- Drake.     
 Darius?     
 DARIUS: Oh, hey, Van.     
 Why are you here?     
 Oh, actually we were just talking about that.     
 It's basically, really just...     
 No, I meant the party. Is Earn with you?     
 No, but I know Drake's chef, Guillermo,     
 from the glorious days of pick-up soccer.     
 But how did we get here?     
 Oh, see, that's an even harder one, actually.     
 - It all start... 
- VAN: No, shut up.     
 Candice drove us here.     
 And then she ditched us for T-Pain's party.     
 That sucks.     
 You okay?     
 I think so.     
 Me and Darius figured out that I am nothing.     
 We're all nothing.     
 It's a simulation, Van.     
 It's all fake.     
 You're right.     
 It's all fake.     
 There's no Drake.     
 So don't ruin your high and just enjoy yourself.     
 Hmm. You're such a good friend.     
 TAMMI: Hey. Hey.     
 Hey, y'all. They kicking everybody out.     
 And, Van, what the hell do you got on?     
 Come on, y'all.     
 NADINE: How are we getting home?     
 Drake's Mexican.
