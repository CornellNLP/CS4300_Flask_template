 - Had to. 
- LOTTIE: I ain't a baby.    
 CHRISTIAN: So, gentlemen, I understand you're looking    
 - for an entertainment lawyer. 
- Yes. Yes, we are.    
 Well, let me tell you a little about myself first.    
 I'm from the D.C. area, near U Street.    
 I graduated from Howard and then went to Georgetown,    
 but I'm definitely a Hoyas fan. (CHUCKLES)    
 I graduated the top ten of my class, and after school,    
 I went to work at the Lance and Roberts Law Firm    
 for almost ten years.

 Been here in Atlanta for the past five years, now.    
 So who are some of the people you represent, man?    
 Well, I represent some singers and some rappers.    
 I represent the rapper A.V.    
 Oh, okay.    
 - Y-You know that dude. 
- Yeah, that dude.    
 - He had that one song, "Program."

 LOTTIE: I don't like lemons.    
 Yes, I know. You hate lemons.    
 If he was to go with you, what would that take?    
 Well, um, just a few signatures,    
 and I would receive five percent    
 of any deal I looked over for you.    
 (SCOFFS) Five percent?    
 Yes, but that's the standard    
 that any lawyer would charge.    
 Look, man. I just don't want no janky-ass lawyer    
 putting his hands on my contracts and checks, a'ight?    
 I want, like, a high-level Jewish dude,    
 not somebody gonna rob me like Don King or some sh1t.    
 Man, Don King wasn't a lawyer, I'm pretty sure.    
 Also, Christian came highly recommended.    
 He-He supposedly does good work.    
 Recommended by who, man?    
 He ain't even got no clients that make actual money.    
 All he got is some F-level rappers    
 and some reality TV stars.    
 Reality TV stars,  Earn.    
 Just find me, like, a big-level firm, man.

 Oh, yeah, I think mine is, uh,     
 like, ex-expired or something.     
 What?     
 I don't know. It could be just the date's a little late.     
 I don't know. Maybe.     
 Whenever you got guys that don't know what they're doing.     
 My nigga, this is definitely expired.     
 (GRUNTS) Don't worry, my friend.     
 I know a place we can go, get a renewal same day. It's okay.     
 Well, we got to do that, like, today. Right now.

 All right. Uh, I got to go.     
 When I get back, we're going to this passport place.     
 I'm gonna make sure that happens, okay?     
 And Al? Could you, um, just stay on these guys?     
 Okay, we got an international flight, which means we got     
 to be there early, and I know you sell weed,     
 - so you don't care about time... 
- True.     
 But it's important, all right?     
 All right. I'll catch you guys later. Lottie!     
 Why did he give me your passport?     
 Huh. All right, it's your turn.     
 Almost there.     
 Here we go. All right.     
 Now we got to... find the... room.     
 - Is it there? 
- No.     
 - Wh-Where? Huh? 
- (KIDS TALKING NEARBY)     
 Okay. Yeah. Here we...     
 There we go.     
 (WOMAN HUMMING TO THE TUNE OF "WHEELS ON THE BUS")     
 I'm sorry. Did we come at a wrong time?     
 Oh. No. No, no, no, not at all.     
 How are you, Vanessa? (CHUCKLES)     
 - Nice to see you again. 
- Mm-hmm.     
 And you must be Lottie's father.     
 - Right? 
- Hi.     
 So nice to finally meet you.     
 This is just a conference I wanted to have     
 to talk to the both of you about Lottie.     
 Is everything all right?     
 Um... she seems to be...     
 very... advanced.     
 Very gifted.     
 - Oh, good. (LAUGHS) 
- Oh, my God. Thank God.     
 I thought she was pulling her hair out     
 - and eating it or something. 
- Oh. Nothing of the sort.     
 Or like sniffing Wite-Out     
 - or something bad. 
- Oh, no, no, no.     
 - Biting children. 
- Yeah.     
 Far from it. Far from it.     
 She is excelling in everything. I mean,     
 she knows all her colors, she knows her letters.     
 She's beginning to work math problems. (CHUCKLES)     
 - Mmm. 
- That's why I spoke     
 with my friend at the Holy Oak Academy.     
 It's one of the best schools in the Southeast.     
 They have space available     
 for their pre-K program next year,     
 and I think it might be a good idea     
 for the two of you to consider enrolling Lottie there.     
 EARN: Okay.     
 - That's a private school? 
- Private school, yeah.     
 It's a private school. It has a reasonable tuition.     
 - Okay. Okay. 
- Mmm.     
 Okay, we'll-we'll definitely do that.     
 That-That-That sounds like something we'd-we'd probably do,     
 - uh, for first grade. 
- Get the money together.     
 Yeah. Is there anything we can do with her staying here,     
 to-to help her progress? Like, maybe, um,     
 some more books or assignments?     
 Stay here? No.     
 This school is awful.     
 - This school is  awful? 
- Yes.     
 There are not enough resources or faculty     
 to engage a student like Lottie.     
 She is really stunting her education here.     
 Is there something we could do for Lottie     
 that, um...     
 would be...     
 cheaper?     
 Keep her in a happy, two-parent household?     
 - Huh. 
- Hmm.     
 - Interesting. 
- Good.     
 - Thank you. 
- Yeah. It was nice     
 - seeing you again, Ms. Granger. 
- Nice to see you, too.     
 Thank you.     
 - VAN: Lottie. 
- To... where are we going?     
 - EARN: Uh, we... we're gonna go home. 
- We're gonna go home.     
 - Bye! 
- Bye!     
 I'm sorry.     
 Um...     
 would you have told us that this school was bad     
 if she really was a regular student?     
 No.     
 If I see a steer smart enough to get out of the pen,     
 I leave the gate open.     
 Thank you for coming in.     
 Thank you.     
 (HUMMING SOFTLY)     
 VAN: So, she just compared the school     
 to a slaughterhouse, right?     
 EARN: Yeah, she definitely did. I heard that.     
 VAN: Okay.     
 I mean, she's crazy.     
 Schools in this area aren't that great. We knew that.     
 - Lottie, come here. 
- Yeah.     
 - (PROTESTS) - But at least here, she won't be the only black kid.     
 I interviewed at Holy Oak's.     
 It is pretty white, but that's all these private schools.     
 - You know that. You chose Princeton. 
- (SQUEAKS)     
 Yeah.     
 LOTTIE: Mm.     
 You leaving for, like, two months?     
 Yeah, but, you know, that...     
 that should be tuition for her now.     
 LOTTIE: Mm.     
 If she goes to this school, she's gonna need you to show up.     
 More than you've been able to.     
 - (LOTTIE SINGING INDISTINCTLY) 
- Yeah, I know. We'll...     
 we'll make it work.     
 Get in the car, baby.     
 I was...     
 - Under the bridge. 
- (LOTTIE MUMBLES)

- Let me help.     
 Oh, watch your head.     
 Oh, it's a big one.     
 - (GRUNTS) 
- (MIMICS GRUNT)     
 You know, I always thought     
 - she was gonna be smart. 
- LOTTIE: That's it.     
 I think every parent thinks that.     
 I don't know. I mean...     
 I thought she was, like, gonna actually be advanced.     
 - What makes you say that? 
- (LOTTIE BABBLING)     
 You're smart.     
 I figured...     
 some of it would get passed along,     
 hopefully.     
 Yeah, well, you're smart, too, so...     
 maybe it was yours, you know?     
 Thanks.     
 All right, I got to... I got to get going.     
 I got to make sure Darius gets his passport     
 - and got to catch this flight. 
- Okay.     
 Be good.     
 All right?     
 Be good for Mama. I love you.     
 (BABBLING)     
 - All right. 
- See you.

 Oh, yeah. Um...     
 Yeah, I'm fine.     
 Just, you know, stupid sh1t.     
 It's nothing.

 Great. Just-just put your luggage in the car, man.     
 Oh. No, I meant I'm packed to move,     
 not for the airport.

 Okay. Oh.

 Yeah. Me, too.     
 But is that the right way, though?     
 I don't think so.

 But, I mean, I do switch it up when I'm wearing a suit.

 Uh, my uncle does it.     
 Thanks, man.     
 Let me ask you something.     
 And, um,     
 be honest.     
 Do you think there's a black lawyer     
 who's as good as your cousin?     
 There definitely is.     
 But, um, part of being good at your job are your connections,     
 and black people just don't have the connections     
 that my cousin has.     
 For systemic reasons.

 (EARN CHUCKLES)     
 - WOMAN (OVER P.A.): Welcome to... 
- EARN: Gate C .     
 - Atlanta, Hartsfield International Airport. - Uh-huh.     
 See, I told you, Earn. 
We was gonna make it.     
 You just got to learn to trust yourself, my friend.     
 We're still late, actually.     
 She printed our tickets, but she made sure to say,     
 "Y'all ain't gonna make it," five times     
 while she was doing it, so we should probably still hurry.     
 MAN (OVER P.A.): Thank you.     
 - Excuse me, sir? 
- No, no.     
 WOMAN (OVER PA): Elizabeth Battola,     
 your child is waiting for you...     
 CLARK: Oh, sh1t. Is that Paper Boi?     
 - (LAUGHS) What's up, y'all? 
- Hey, what's going on, man?     
 - Y'all niggas ready for this tour? 
- Sh... Oh, yeah.     
 Man, we gonna be poppin' bottles in Paris, bro.     
 - It's gonna be crazy. Yeah. 
- It's lit, bro.     
 Speaking sign language to hoes.     
 - It's gonna be dope, man. 
- How you doing, man?     
 - I'm good, man. 
- You check out that lawyer I sent you?     
 Hell, yeah, man. He's perfect. I appreciate it.     
 (OVERLAPPING CHATTER)     
 Hey, okay, cool. Let's-let's do this over here.     
 Flight's not gonna leave without Clark County, baby.     
 - Yeah. 
- (DISTANT BEEP)     
 Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!     
 - (SOFT BEEPING) 
- WOMAN: Please take liquids     
 - out of your bags... 
- (BEEPING)     
 and laptops, too.     
 Place everything in the bins.     
 - Your pockets should be empty. 
- WOMAN  : Remove your jackets.     
 (LOUDLY): Opt out!     
 - MAN: Oh. 
- (PEOPLE MURMURING)     
 You always got to opt out. Opt for the pat-down, man.     
 I'm telling you, this-this thing here... bad business.     
 That's why security stays so close to the food.     
 They don't want you to smell your brain frying in this thing.     
 (LAUGHING)     
 - (BEEPS) 
- WOMAN: Excuse me. Sorry.     
 WOMAN  : Everything in the bins, people.     
 (ZIPPERING)     
 (SOUND CEASES EXCEPT FOR QUIET BEEPING)     
 (SOUND RESUMES, INDISTINCT CHATTER)     
 Will you hand me a bin?     
 You got to get it from the front, man.     
 Oh, man, he asked nicely.     
 - (MUMBLING) 
- Thanks.     
 (INDISTINCT, OVERLAPPING CROWD CHATTER)     
 - ALFRED: You know what I don't get? 
- DARIUS: Huh?     
 How they make you take all your sh1t off, and they try to rush     
 to get you out of the way, like they ain't just asked me     
 - to take all your sh1t off ten seconds ago. 
- (DARIUS LAUGHS)     
 ALFRED: That's why I f*ckin' hate the airport, man.     
 DARIUS: Yeah, it's not efficient.     
 - ALFRED: All that sh1t isn't. 
- We should hurry.     
 - All right. 
- WOMAN: Whose bag is this?     
 Hey, what-what-what...? 
What's going on?     
 WOMAN: We're going this way.     
 We're starting another line this way.     
 CLARK: Hey, yo, Luke, come here.

 Man, this trip gonna be crazy, boy.     
 I mean, I ain't never really left Georgia before, so, yeah.     
 Yeah.

 (SIGHS)     
 Yeah, it'll be cool.

 Yeah.     
 (SIGHS HEAVILY)     
 - WOMAN: Is this yours, ma'am? 
- WOMAN  : Yes, ma'am.     
 WOMAN: Okay, I'm just gonna move this over here     
 to make a little more room.     
 I saw what you did...     
 - at TSA. 
- Mm.     
 You ain't got to say sh1t.     
 Just know that's exactly what I'm talking about.     
 (ALFRED SIGHS)     
 Niggas do not care about us, man.     
 Niggas gonna do whatever they got to do to survive,     
 'cause they ain't got no choice.     
 We ain't got no choice, either.     
 You my family, Earn.     
 (PLANE ENGINE WHIRRING)     
 Yeah, you...     
 You're the only one that knows what I'm about.     
 You give a f*ck.     
 I need that.     
 All right?     
 All right, then.     
 Hey?     
 Let's get this money.     
 (BOTH LAUGH)     
 BOTH: Brrr!

 ALFRED: Hey, Clark, man?     
 Let me holler at you.     
 Yeah. What's up, man?     
 Where Luke at, man?     
 Uh, nah, man.     
 Luke got in some sh1t. Cops took him.     
 ALFRED: What you talking about?     
 TSA found a tool in his bag.     
 Damn.     
 - Oh. 
- It's just kind of...     
 Oh, he probably had a screwdriver or something.     
 You can't have those on a plane.     
 Yeah. More like a hammer.     
 Yeah. It was gold, too.     
 sh1t was clean, though.     
 Wish it was mine.
