 How do I take off a mask when it stops being a mask, when it's as much a part of me as I am?

 Amen.

 I'm Ray. 
 To stay as sane as possible until he's gone. 
 I am not to be gotten rid of! 
 I find you refreshing... young, bold... exactly what we need right now. 
 The FBI believes that I was behind the hack. 
 Gideon's gonna rat you out.

 ♪ Ding, dong, ding ♪ 
 All right, man, explain this to me again. 
 Why are you taking me to an arcade? 
 Well, I'm trying to tell you, but you don't listen. 
 That's the problem with your generation... too ADD to really take in this world. 
 All right, all right, break it down for me. 
 Well, to really get it, I got to take you back to 1924. 
 Husband-and-wife team, the Bedfords, opened up a freak show/ dwarf sanctuary on this land you're about to be at. 
 Dwarf sanctuary? 
 Yeah, they called it the Bedford Lilliputian... a whole miniature city scaled down for dwarf and midget inhabitants. 
 I mean, they also had other freaks like lion-faced man, limbless woman, sh1t like that. 
 But the dwarves were the big moneymaker. 
 Suffice to say, the Bedfords were a big hit... lines around the corner, the biggest attraction out here in Coney Island. 
 Then one year, rumor has it, the husband wakes up one Christmas morning, grabs a large kitchen knife, slices his wife's throat open, stabs his little kids to death, then slits his own wrists. 
 Huh. 
 No motive was ever determined. 
 God. 
 Cut to the 1960s. 
 Woman named Mary Meghan Fisher decided to buy up the place, turned it into an old-school arcade... pinball machines, Skee-Ball, the likes. 
 Called it "Games Games Games." 
 sh1t, a bit on the nose, if you ask me, not to mention repetitive, but at least it had clarity. 
 Mary Meghan even installed a little bar so she could get drunk with her friends and shoot pool at night. 
 And so she did, almost every night... till one time in '86, she got so liquored up, she accidentally fell off the barstool and landed hard on the pool cue she was holding. 
 Oh. 
 Went right through her neck, clean. 
 Killed her right on the spot. 
 What in the f... are you telling me this for, man? 
 (DOOR CREAKS AND BANGS) 
 Place remained dormant until 2000, when Ned Bosham bought up the joint under the name Fun Society Amusement LLC. 
 Ned wanted to reopen it as a classic arcade. 
 Now, why anyone would want to start an arcade in 2000 beats me, but Ned Bosham had it in his mind that that's what he wanted to do, and so he did. 
 (CLICKING AND CREAKING) 
 About a year ago, his oldest son, Harold, wanted to sell it, but Ned wasn't down with that. 
 So the oldest son, Harold, being simpleminded and needing money for whatever simpleminded folks need money for, decided Dad had to go. 
 So Harold stole his twin brother's hunting rifle and shot Dad in the face. 
 Now, what Harold wasn't counting on, considering he had never fired a weapon before, was the kickback. 
 It kicked back so hard, he tripped and fell out of his dad's 20-story window. 
 (HISSES) 
 By the time he hit the ground, his head opened up like one of those Gallagher watermelons. 
 All this commotion stirred awake his twin brother, Clyde, who, as he told it to me, was in his bedroom catching some Zs when all this went down. 
 By the time he got his bearings, he was immediately arrested for the double homicide of his brother and father, being the weapon was in his name. 
 And how do you know Clyde? 
 He was my cellmate. 
 This place made him crazy. 
 He thinks it's cursed. 
 (WHISPERING) Yeah. No sh1t, Sherlock. 
 Before I left the clink, he gave me the keys to the joint and made me swear to burn it down before it caused any more ruckus. 
 He swears it's haunted... believes it is the nexus of all evil in the universe. 
 You buy into any of this sh1t? 
 F... no, man. 
 I'm too broke to be superstitious. 
 In a way, all this hocus-pocus keeps things clean for whatever it is you need to do. 
 The public records are in limbo. 
 People down in county don't even want to touch the place. 
 I'm siphoning electricity from the grid. 
 As far as anyone's concerned, it don't exist. 
 Now, on the market, this joint would run you about 5 grand a month, but since it's you, I'll give it to your guy for half. 
 Come on, Mobley, don't give me that look, man. 
 You know how hard it is for an ex-con to get a job. 
 Money's tight, especially with my mom's cataracts. 
 The bills are adding up. 
 I'm not here to rent from you, Romero. 
 I want you to work with us. 
 Oh, hell no, man. I just got out. 
 I ain't trying to go back no time soon. 
 Just hear my guy out, okay? 
 We need a phreaker. 
 Now, you know you're the best in the game. 
 Don't try to sweet-talk me, motherf... er. 
 I don't need you to tell me who's the best in the game. 
 I invented the sh1t, okay? 
 Now, either you're renting, or I'm finding somebody else, but I cannot get mixed up in whatever it is you're doing. 
 Man, this is a chance to get back at the system that stole six years of your life. 
 This is a game changer, man. 
 Who's this guy, again? 
 He's, uh... he's a little weird. 
 But, uh, he's gonna love this place. 
 He's got a thing for Coney Island. 
 You'll like him. 
 Actually, you'll hate him. 
 But he's a genius. 
 Best coder I've ever met. 
 And he wants to meet you. 
 How much? 
 Aw, don't smile. I ain't said yes yet. 
 Money's gonna be the deciding factor in all this, and it's gonna need to be a whole lot to bring me back in. 
 That's the thing, man. 
 In a way, this pays everything.

 (FOREBODING MUSIC) 
 Not yet where I'm supposed to be. 
 But soon, very soon. 
 Protestors are taking to the street in massive numbers, and police and community leaders are at a loss as to what to do at this point, citing that... 
 And where is that?

 Angela. 
 Yes, come. Please, please. 
 I'd like you to meet two of your colleagues. 
 Gentlemen, introduce yourselves. 
 Saul Weinberg, managing director of operations. 
 Hi. Angela. It's nice to meet you. 
 Jim Chutney, SVP of B.A. 
 Angela. 
 Phillip Price, master of the universe.

 Yes. 
 Yes, yes, yes, yes. 
 Because of the situation, you have to pay upfront now. 
 (GRUNTS) 
 Well, a toast. 
 May new relationships lead to new opportunities. 
 (PANTING) 
 Oh, God. 
 Alexa, when is the end of the world? 
 Unless it collides with a very large rock or a future technology goes very wrong indeed, Earth is most likely to be destroyed when the sun swells into a red giant in several billion years' time. 
 Right.

 I know you... you want me to talk about myself, but I don't... 
 The Adderall's almost out of my system. 
 With that, sleep will return. 
 Any second now, he's gonna come back, and my mind will be under siege again. 
 This isn't something, like, I-I... 
 Mr. Robot has become my god, and like all gods, their madness takes you prisoner. 
 There was this... 
 I guess I couldn't avoid Gideon's death after all. 
 My dam of guilt is finally cracking. 
 I want to cry, but I'm so high that I can't. 
 There was an Indian man working behind the counter, and I made fun of his accent. 
 (IMITATING INDIAN ACCENT) And talk like this. 
 "Hello, how you doing?" 
 (IN NORMAL VOICE) And one day, he stood up for himself. 
 (IMITATING INDIAN ACCENT) "Sir, I must ask you to leave." 
 (IN NORMAL VOICE) And something snapped in me, and I just popped him in the face. 
 I saw red, man. 
 I just... I just kept punching him and punching him. 
 And I hated him so much. 
 He was Indian. 
 (CRYING) 
 But it was raining. 
 There was a thunderstorm, and I remember stepping outside. 
 And the clouds parted, and the sun came out. 
 And I knew that that was God showing up for me in that moment. 
 (CRYING) 
 He forgave me. 
 Jesus loves you. 
 And this was clearly just a test. 
 All : Amen. 
 Elliot, would you like to share? 
 No, man. 
 My system's hung. 
 God can help you. 
 Is that what God does? 
 He helps? 
 Tell me, why didn't God help my innocent friend who died for no reason while the guilty roam free? 
 Okay, fine. 
 Forget the one-offs. 
 How about the countless wars declared in his name? 
 Okay, fine. 
 Let's skip the random, meaningless murder for a second, shall we? 
 How about the racist, sexist, phobia soup we've all been drowning in because of him? 
 (PENSIVE MUSIC) 
 And I'm not just talking about Jesus. 
 I'm talking about all organized religion... exclusive groups created to manage control, a dealer getting people hooked on the drug of hope, his followers nothing but addicts who want their hit of bullshit to keep their... their dopamine of ignorance, addicts afraid to believe the truth... that there is no order, there's no power, that all religions are just metastasizing mind worms meant to divide us so it's easier to rule us by the charlatans that want to run us.

 Angela and I are going to have one more drink. 
 Oh, of course. 
 Of course. 
 Thank you for dinner, Phillip. 
 Mm-hmm. 
 Don't get up. 
 It was good to have met you. 
 Pleasure meeting you, Angela. 
 Now remember, come see us anytime. 
 We'll have lunch. 
 On you. (LAUGHING) 
 (SIGHS) 
 So... did you enjoy the semifreddo? 
 Was it all I promised? 
 Yes. 
 Excellent! 
 Absolutely. It was delicious. 
 Good. 
 And good company. 
 Jim's been with us for 27 years. 
 He's a Harvard guy... lives upstate. 
 Three kids... two in college, one in high school. 
 Company man through and through. 
 He's the reason we do our Toys for Tots program. 
 And Saul is the chair of our nonprofit arm. 
 Good man as well. 
 He has grandkids, so he's... he's a little ahead in the family department. 
 Oh, and another thing they have in common: they were both in the room with Colby when they made that grave error covering up the leak in your hometown. 
 Hmm. 
 Ordinary men... 
 Capable of extraordinary things. 
 Our CFO has discovered that within the last two years, both Jim and Saul have been engaged in some nasty insider trading. 
 Thick as thieves, these two. 
 They like to buddy up on their white-collar crimes... a regular Rosencrantz and Guildenstern. 
 There's enough evidence in there to put them away for years. 
 I should get home. 
 Your car will be out front. 
 Whatever you're doing, I don't trust it. 
 You're panicking right now. 
 I understand. 
 It's a big decision you're making, because these men, their lives will be destroyed. 
 But the minute you remove emotion from this... 
 You'll do just fine. 
 (INDISTINCT CHATTER) 
 Heard you had an interesting night. 
 Chaplain's an old friend. 
 I threw it out for a reason. 
 I figured you might want it for down the road. 
 Trust me, I've been there. 
 (CLEARS THROAT) 
 Five years, seven months, three weeks, and two days ago, my wife passed away. 
 A few weeks of being frozen in my own grief, I woke up one morning, fixed myself breakfast like I normally do, plugged myself into my dialysis machine like I normally do, and started talking... out loud. 
 For a second, I thought I was crazy. 
 Moved on with the day. 
 Then the next day, I did it again... talked out loud... and the next. 
 And then I realized who I was talking to. 
 Why are you telling me all of this? 
 'Cause you and me are a lot more alike than you think, Elliot. 
 (KNOCKING ON THE DOOR) 
 (KNOCKING ON THE DOOR) 
 Are you crazy? 
 How the hell you knocking on my door this early? 
 I'm sorry, Mrs. Romero. 
 I'm Dominique DiPierro with the FBI. 
 I'm assisting Homicide on your son's case. 
 I know it's early, but I just had a few more questions about your son's murder. 
 I already talked to the police! 
 I know the cops took all your joints. 
 I looked through your files. 
 I also know you have arthritis and probably can't roll 'em yourself, so I'm guessing your son did. 
 I can help roll 'em for you if you'd like. 
 Used to do it all the time for my kid brother back in high school. 
 He always told me I was pretty bomb at it. 
 (DOOR CLICKS OPEN) 
 All right! 
 You can come on in. 
 Mmm. 
 Yeah, it's tight. 
 Not perfect, but definitely doable. 
 Yeah, it's not as fat as my dear Leslie's. 
 That boy wasn't around much, but he was always doing for me. 
 Always. 
 God bless him. 
 I see you're moving out. 
 Ah, yeah. 
 I can't stay here no more. 
 I raised Leslie here, Huh. Too many memories here. 
 Did he go anywhere or do anything suspicious? 
 Any small detail could help. 
 Well, he be fooling around with those computers. 
 You guys know that. 
 He always did that since he was little. 
 I never understood it. 
 Gobbledygook, if you ask me. 
 Did he have any friends? 
 Did anyone ever come to the house? 
 Friends? 
 Leslie didn't have no friends, except that chubby boy. 
 (COUGHING) 
 You mind if you get me... grab me a glass of water? 
 Should be some in the boxes. 
 Oh, yeah, of course. 
 That's right, you told the cops someone did come, but you didn't see him, right? 
 Nope, not with these cataracts. 
 I can barely make you out from my cat. 
 Where is that thing, anyway? 
 Probably ran off like everyone else. 
 (TENSE MUSIC) 
 Did he say his name? 
 Have you seen him before? 
 Nope. 
 My mind was dancing in the clouds. 
 All I know is, I can't live here no more.

 What do I do? 
 Why did you start writing that journal in the first place? 
 I thought it was the right answer. 
 The right answer to what? 
 Controlling my life. 
 (SIGHS) My wife... well, she drove her car that day. 
 She did everything right. 
 She always wore her seat belt, hands at 10:00 and 2:00. 
 She was the most perfect driver I'd ever met. 
 (LAUGHING) It was... it was annoying. 
 She stayed in the lines. 
 Never went above or below the speed limit. 
 Stopped at traffic signs. 
 She followed every rule. 
 And then one day, none of that mattered. 
 Control is about as real as a one-legged unicorn taking a leak at the end of a double rainbow. 
 Then what do we have? 
 You know that bullshit people say about how when you fall, you got to get up? 
 I reject that sh1t, man. 
 You know why? 
 The whole thing is a fall. 
 It can't help but be. 
 A perpetual state of grasping in the dark. 
 It's not about getting up. 
 It's about stumbling, stumbling in the right direction. 
 It's the only true way to move forward. 
 Whoever it is you wrote about in your journal, do you still see him? 
 I can tell the person you're writing about meant something to you. 
 Sometimes he takes over? 
 That's why you don't remember things? 
 I shouldn't have come. 
 I don't want to talk about this. 
 Yes, you do. 
 'Cause you're smart enough to know that keeping this inside isn't going to last. 
 You play chess? 
 I've been looking for a good adversary.
