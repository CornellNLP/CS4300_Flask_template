 You're locked into a set of moves as determined by your previous choices...

 Not really. 
 It was a computer chess game. 
 You always told me you had to know more moves ahead than the player or user. 
 Sounds like good advice from a good father.

 Everyone's hurting because of us. 
 We are running around in circles. 
 This will be the last time that we do it. 
 Been thinking about what you said earlier. 
 You can think all the moves you want, but at the end of the day, the moves that I'm making are the ones you're telling me to make. 
 He's right. 
 There over 9 million different possible positions after three chess moves each. 
 There are over 288 billion different possible positions after four moves. 
 The number of 40-move games is greater than the number of electrons in the observable universe. 
 You don't need to know those outcomes. 
 You just need to be able to see ahead of your opponent.

 I want Melissa's job, and it's non-negotiable. 
 Go on. 
 I saw the pattern. 
 In every version of the settlement draft for the Washington Township suit, there was one small point that your team wouldn't agree on. 
 It remained the same, even from the original case: That a third-party company must perform inspections on the Washington Township plant. 
 You continue to give up power on all these other provisions that appear to be a lot more expensive and important, all in an attempt to drop this one small point. 
 I know why you had those guys arrested and why you gave me this job. 
 You want me to convince the class to remove the contingency, and I'm willing to do all of that, because you're gonna give me exactly what I want in return.

 I must say, you are very impressive.
