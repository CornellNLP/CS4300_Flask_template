 There's no way. 
 We've already committed $900 billion. 
 It would be irresponsible if the feds sent more. 
 And we're not going to ask the government to pony up the cash. 
 How do you burn through that kind of money in 30 days anyway? 
 You have something right... right there. 
 Finally you're seeing my point. 
 No, no, on your face. 
 The point is, Phillip, we've already given you our burst of cash on hand. 
 We can't give you any more. 
 Well, we'll sell the T-bills to the Chinese, and that money in return will be used as a loan for our company. 
 Look, the real recovery program is months from being done. 
 The public is hoarding cash. 
 The housing market is grinding to a halt. 
 The big three are on the verge of collapse. 
 Everyone at the commission needs to see results within the next three weeks before we can do anything else. 
 Look, rebuilding our database is the only solution to this problem. 
 This is not my opinion. 
 These are the facts, ladies and gentlemen. 
 Now, I've cooperated with you on every level. 
 I even have the goddamn FBI working out of my offices. 
 Janet, Mary, Jack, please. 
 Tell me you didn't ask me to fly down all the way to D.C. just so you could, what, hear yourselves complain? 
 You've got to resign. 
 We have no other options. 
 The President can't go to Congress with a bailout right now. 
 In the fallout of the Great Depression, FDR closed all the banks for a bank holiday, and then he reopened them in stages when they were reported to being sound. 
 Later, historians discovered what we in this room now know, that those reports, they were mostly lies. 
 Nevertheless, it worked. 
 It worked because the public believed the government had everything under control. 
 You see, that is the business model for this great nation of ours. 
 Every business day when that market bell rings, we con people into believing in something, the American dream, family values. 
 Could be freedom fries for all I care. 
 It doesn't matter as long as the con works and people buy and sell whatever it is we want them to. 
 If I resign, then any scrap of confidence the public is already clinging onto will be destroyed, and we all know a con doesn't work without the confidence. 
 If this was the best idea you could come up with for a win, I shouldn't be the one resigning. 
 I have to head back to New York. 
 Let me know when you've locked up the votes, and wipe your goddamn mouth.

 Question is... which is the truth?

 Maybe what we think is all we got, which is why I'm a little jealous of Maxine over here, 'cause all she gives a sh1t about is eating and sleeping. 
 Ain't that right, girl?

 Not the loquacious type, I get it. 
 Me, I talk all the time, but I guess you picked up on that. 
 It's cool though. Communication... is good for my line of work.

 Without my weapon of choice, Mr. Robot is unplugged, powerless. 
 He'll try to wear us down, but as long as we stick to the regimen, he can't take control no matter how much of an illusion he thinks this is. 
 I mean, it's a disgrace, an absolutely disgrace police have not found this guy. 
 Not only does all the evidence behind the Five/Nine attacks lead to him, but he is the leading suspect behind the Sharon Knowles murder. 
 I've said it before. I'll say it again. 
 The misogynistic blind eye by law enforcement in this...

 This time targeting the Bank of E network in an elaborate ransomware attack. 
 The malicious malware targeted the bank's computer servers and spread to multiple branches in North America, encrypting the data and rendering the systems unusable until a ransom was paid. 
 This more militant variant of the hacker collective forced Scott Knowles, the CTO of E Corp, to burn $5.9 million in public view. 
 Shortly thereafter pictures surfaced on social media under the name #OPdailyallowance. 
 Now, this is considered a direct response to E Corp's unpopular program, which would lower their daily cash withdrawal allowances for customers to $50.
