 Every relationship's a power struggle. 
 Some of us need to be controlled. 
 Why did you first start listening to me? 
 I just followed your lead. 
 I don't want to be a leader. 
 I want my position moved to the risk management department. 
 If we pull milestone cases like Washington Township... 
 There's not much we can do here today. 
 Closing the plant is not an option. 
 I'm being pressured to resign. Not doing anything to help.

 Dark Army, FBI, cops. 
 He hacked me and stole my dog on top of it. 
 That proves it was him.

 I've spoken with the prosecutor, and we can get the hacking charges reduced. 
 The theft charge is a little more difficult. 
 The plaintiff is really upset about the dog, but I think we can negotiate. 
 Hey, you heard what I said, right? 
 When the judge asks you for a plea you say, "Not guilty." 
 Got it? 
 (GAVEL STRIKING) 
 In the case of People vs. Alderson how does the defendant plead? 
 Guilty. 
 (GROANS) You're sh1tting me. 
 Mr. Alderson, you do realize Mr. Lenny Shannon's dog was an expensive purchase at $1,200? 
 That makes your theft a felony. 
 Let the record show, Mr. Alderson nodded his head up and down indicating "yes," and you're admitting you hacked into Mr. Shannon's email, social media, and bank accounts, which will convict you on both counts of computer hacking? 
 Again, let the record show, Mr. Alderson nodded his head up and down indicating "yes." 
 You're aware of the gravity of these allegations? 
 You will be sentenced to jail. 
 What the f*ck are you doing? 
 Yes... and I plead guilty. 
 Do you make this plea out of free will and free mind?

 I hacked my Dark Army contact. 
 Found an archive with screenshots of his IRC chats with them. 
 Something called Stage 2. 
 It has to do with the femtocell. 
 I tried to tell Trenton and Mobley, but I couldn't get in touch with either of them. 
 I called, message checked all the usual haunts. 
 Both are AWOL. 
 Okay, Trenton's parents are a wreck. 
 They filed a missing person's report.

 Why the f*ck are you sending pictures of me while I'm asleep to the Dark Army?

 Why were you talking with them?

 One second everything was normal. 
 All of a sudden, you stopped responding. 
 It was like you shut down. 
 I had to say something. 
 It's unfortunate what both your country and the company have been through in the last several weeks. 
 Yes. 
 A succession of unfortunate events. 
 The timing of which almost seems intentional. 
 Well, at least there's good news for both of us. 
 Your little pet project came through even better than you thought. 
 I must admit, she surprised me. 
 It's a good thing that she did the right thing in the end.

 We failed our financial stress test, so we won't be able to keep up all our facilities. 
 As of noon this Friday, I'm sorry to say, the Washington Township plant will be taken over by the federal government.

 Your actions remind me of your predecessor, Phillip. 
 And here comes the veiled death threat.

 You wanna take a shot at me? 
 Be my guest. 
 The appointment of a new CEO isn't going to stop the federal government from taking over the plant. 
 I flew for 13 hours and 35 minutes, if you have a point, it's time. 
 I needed that bailout money, and I no longer have it. 
 Thanks to your little shootout in China. 
 What do I need now? 
 Cash. 
 Lots of it. 
 I could see a scenario where the Chinese government, in a bid to establish itself as the new global leader of the 21st century, loans E Corp the money it needs... 
 At a low interest rate. 
 Perhaps even zero. 
 As a gesture of goodwill to the American people. 
 With that cash, I could save your plant from the clutches of the federal government, and finally, when a peaceful China appears benevolent, well... (CHUCKLES) 
 That's an easier pitch for me to get onto the President's desk. 
 I will be happy to go back and talk with the Chinese government. 
 I'm sure that they will be most agreeable, but the next time you threaten my plant... 
 What? 
 What? 
 The only move left in that scenario is a third World War. 
 You see? I'm a mercenary.
