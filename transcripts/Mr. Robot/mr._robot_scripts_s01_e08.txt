 The redundant backups at their eastern data center in China, the Dark Army is covering us on that. 
 We can go now! 
 If we move forward and they don't, China still holds all the redundant information. 
 It will be pointless. 
 If we can talk to whiterose directly... 
 No way he's meeting you face to face. 
 You fools actually got your wish. 
 I don't know why, but the meeting's actually gonna be on. 
 I'd tell you to be careful, but I know that's the last thing you're gonna be. 
 I had the sysadmin check that server again. 
 Of course, there was nothing. 
 I have no idea what there was to even be suspicious about. 
 Why do you have my work ID? 
 I placed a malicious CD in my work computer. 
 I need you to do something for me. 
 Our new Chief Technology Officer, Scott Knowles. 
 Meet me tonight, on the roof. 
 Cameras have been out since March. 
 No one will know.

 Darlene : What if this all went away? 
 The city. 
 The money. 
 All of it. 
 man : What, like a zombie apocalypse or something? 
 More like a revolution. 
 Last time we hooked up, we agreed to check politics at the door. 
 There's no middle anymore. 
 Just rich and poor. 
 Okay, this sh1t is way too heavy for me this early. 
 I gotta go to work. 
 Right. 
 Solving the world's problems one spreadsheet at a time. 
 Hey, it's either suits like me or the government. 
 We all know how well they handle things. 
 Why can't the world just take care of itself? 
 Because the world is filled with stupid people. 
 And I get paid a lot to be smart. 
 Hey. 
 There's not just the rich and the poor. 
 There's you, in the middle somewhere.

 Jesus Christ, man, how long have you been sitting on all this? 
 I installed a patch four weeks ago, and I've been monitoring it daily. 
 No rest for the wicked. 
 I wanted to make sure it was all updated at the Steel Mountain locations before the meeting with whiterose. 
 Yeah, those Airdream guys are so dumb. 
 Who has all their thermostats phone home the same network? 
 I'll sync up all five locations so they heat at exactly the same rate. 
 No offense, but I'll handle that. 
 You should take care of the alarms, so there's not a signal of the temp raising in the vaults.

 One of my employees confessed to breaking chain of custody with the Colby dat file. 
 Unfortunately, this admission will render the evidence inadmissible and Colby free of charges. 
 Now before you say anything, I want to assure you that Allsafe has doubled its efforts to find the hackers, whether it be reconfirming Colby's involvement or finding the real perpetrators. 
 We've air-gapped your private network, implemented a honeypot, reconfigured all the firewalls and systematically... 
 Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. 
 A honeypot, for what? 
 A specific server involved in the last fsociety attack, CS30. 
 I know we checked it out, but if there's even a chance the hackers are still in the network, the honeypot will ensure that they can't cause any damage. 
 They'll log into the decoy server we've set up, thinking they're on the main network. 
 And I'm personally keeping tabs on all traffic. 
 So you have our full attention. 
 [cell phone vibrates] 
 Well, I appreciate your transparency. 
 Well, so you understand then. 
 Of course. 
 In fact, I'd like to look over your findings, especially this server. 
 So, please send me the research. 
 Of course, of course. 
 Well, thank you again for seeing me.

 What about the police? 
 They found a body on the roof. 
 A body? Who? 
 They're not saying, but detectives came by. 
 They want to speak with you. 
 With me? 
 Elizabeth : They're questioning everyone who was at the reception last night. 
 Clearly, this is tragic, but unfortunately work goes on. 
 But don't you think you should... 
 Tell them they can set an appointment. 
 I'd be happy to speak with them then. 
 Oh, and, Elizabeth, I need you to connect me with the Dulles Server Farm. 
 I'll take it on my mobile. 
 And the file shares? 
 'Cause client data is inaccessible until we're back online. 
 Jumping on that now.

 I want a full report. 
 Ollie, sales. 
 All appointments at Allsafe are cancelled until further notice. 
 Word of this cannot get out. 
 All right, let's get to it. 
 Elliot voice-over : This hack is far from devastating. 
 They already own us. 
 They're not going after anything valuable. 
 This is more of a distraction. 
 But what are they trying to distract us from? 
 Hey, bro. 
 Always the chatterbox. 
 You're sweating. 
 Oh, yeah? Yeah, maybe a little. 
 Been running around. 
 Look, I sorta need you to handle something for me. 
 What have they got you doing here? 
 Trying to reverse engineer the malware. 
 Okay, I'm gonna need you to stop doing that and take these corrupted drives over to Blank's Disk Recovery on 36th and 5th. 
 Why me? Get one of the IT guys. 
 Everyone is swamped, Elliot. 
 Dude, this isn't, like, a debate. 
 I've always wanted things to be cool between us, but I outrank you.

 You weren't around. 
 Yeah. 
 Kinda had a rough month. 
 I'm sorry. 
 Tell me what happened. 
 We were being pressured. 
 By who? 
 Some guy. 
 He gave Ollie a CD that infected his laptop, stole his pictures, his emails, and browser cache. 
 He said to install the disk at Allsafe, or he would leak everything online. 
 It was a while ago. 
 I thought he forgot about us. 
 Elliot voice-over : I was right. 
 The hack was a distraction. 
 This is about me. This is the meeting. 
 You should have come to me. 
 I told you, you weren't there. 
 You're never there anymore. 
 Something is going on with you, Elliot. 
 You have not been the same the past couple of months, and this happened before Shayla. 
 You're wrong. 
 You're lying! 
 You don't talk to me anymore! 
 Just tell me what to do here! 
 Because the only solution I can think of is to give up. 
 God, say something! 
 You're right. 
 We don't talk anymore. 
 It's so strange. 
 I really miss us. 
 Why is that strange? 
 Because I never thought I'd have to. 
 Elliot voice-over : Hackers. 
 We inherently trust no one, including each other. 
 I'll never be able to tell her. 
 There will always be this divide, my wall that she can't look over. 
 And she knows it. 
 Elliot voice-over : Trust issues. 
 The Dark Army has taken extraordinary steps to make sure this meeting's exactly how they want it. 
 Is that why the infamous whiterose is such a legend? 
 Because he's more paranoid than the rest of us?

 I manage my time very carefully, Mr. Alderson.

 I have allotted you no more than three minutes. 
 Are you really gonna do that? 
 I suggest you pick better topics of conversation. 
 I have 17 more items on my agenda today. 
 The Evil Corp hack, we should go through with it this time. 
 You are turning out to be a grave disappointment. 
 We were ready. We had everything set to go. 
 Dwelling is so inefficient. 
 Hey, you pulled out last time. 
 Wasting more time, telling me things I already know. 
 [clicks tongue] 
 But we were ready. 
 That is the third time that you have expressed that. 
 Elliot voice-over : She's trolling me.

 You have not advanced this conversation. 
 Do you intend to? 
 Since last month, Evil Corp has moved its tapes to five... 
 Backup facilities, and you have a plan to take them all down. 
 Yes. 
 Finally, you have communicated something. 
 So are you ready to do this or not? 
 You are the one who is not ready. 
 It was you who failed all along. 
 What you've lacked was focus. 
 You strayed from the hack to target Terry Colby. 
 This opened a vulnerability. 
 Suspicion. 
 Specifically by Gideon Goddard. 
 That's why you hacked Allsafe. 
 To monitor his activities. 
 And that's when we discovered that he turned your infected server into a honeypot. 
 [beep] 
 Oh, 60 seconds and this meeting will be over. 
 Wait. 
 The concept of waiting bewilders me. 
 There are always deadlines. 
 There are always ticking clocks. 
 That's why you must manage your time. 
 I'll find a way to remove the honeypot. 
 Until 16 seconds ago, you were not aware there was a honeypot. 
 This does not inspire confidence. 
 Wait. 
 There's that word again. 
 We'll take care of it. 
 You know you could have told us about the honeypot weeks ago. 
 Every hacker has her fixation. 
 You hack people, I hack time. 
 So you should know that when I set a time line, there's a reason. 
 You have 50 hours and 23 minutes. 
 At that point, when all parties are ready, we will initiate the hack. 
 We'll do it. 
 Maybe next time... 
 Understand something, Mr. Alderson. 
 After I leave, you will never see me again. 
 There are very few people in my life that I have enough time to see more than once, and you are not one of them. 
 Trust me, that's not going to matter. 
 Why are you doing all of this?

 Security token. Gideon's phone.

 50 hours and 19 minutes left. 
 Damn, she infected me with her time paranoia. 
 We're all living in each other's paranoia.

 Sorry. 
 Have I told you what I saw when I hacked Gideon? 
 When I peeked into his secrets? 
 I saw a good, honest man. 
 Gideon was wrong. 
 I am finished here. 
 I'm no good for him or this place. 
 He was only protecting his people. 
 But me? 
 I'm doing this to protect everyone. 
 Tyrell : Seems you've been very busy lately. 
 I have to know what you're planning. 
 We were meant to be allies. 
 We might just want the same thing, and I need to be involved. 
 I'm pretty positive you're dead wrong about that, my friend. 
 I don't think there's anything we could possibly agree on. 
 I don't know what game you're playing, but I suggest you cut the bullshit. 
 If there's nothing else, I think we're done here. 
 Aren't you forgetting that I know your dirty little secret? 
 There are people close to you that wouldn't be happy if they knew what I know. 
 We're both too smart to allow pettiness to dictate our actions. 
 We're better than that. 
 Weigh the pros and cons. 
 Do what you need to do. 
 As soon as the tabulations are over with, you'll know that telling anyone about that does neither one of us any good.
