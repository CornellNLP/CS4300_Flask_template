 Brukner : Previously on The Art of More... 
 Graham : What do you know about Sam Bruckner? 
 Davenport : That he's bombastic, impossibly egotistical... 
 How do I get his account? 
 Make them think they're more important than they are. 
 My account is worth a lot more than just one statue. 
 I have more. 
 That better be a goddamn mirage! 
 We're here to make money, as we did in Iraq. 
 The mask is missing. 
 I'll find it. 
 Is that Avery Swift in 4206? 
 I'm Roxanna Whitman. 
 You have a Van Gogh in your collection, isn't that right? 
 Oh, yes! 
 Roxanna : I signed the Swift Collection. 
 Where are the good ones? 
 The Monets, the Rembrandts, the Van Gogh? 
 This is all there is. 
 (alarm ringing) 
 Guard : Stop! 
 Stop! 
 Stop where you are! 
 Put it on the ground! 
 Slowly. 
 Then hands in the air! 
 Come on! 
 Come on! 
 Run! Let's go! Come on! 
 It's not fair. 
 You keep getting sexier and I keep getting fatter. 
 You're the sexy one. 
 I'm just sweaty. 
 What are you doing, babe? Come on, put that down. You're pregnant. 
 No. I'm helping out. 
 Allison! 
 I'm fine. I'm fine. 
 Don't ever do that again. You scared the living sh1t out of me. 
 What happened? 
 I tripped on something. 
 What is that? 
 My appraiser should be here any minute. 
 Look, I know you're getting hit from all sides. It must be overwhelming. 
 Picture. 
 Why don't you let me take you and your wife out to dinner? 
 We get away from all the craziness. 
 You tell me what your priorities are, and I'll do my best to help you achieve them. 
 Let's check with Allison. 
 Yeah, sure. 
 Hey, honey, Graham wants to take us out to dinner tonight. 
 Get away from all the craziness. 
 Actually, can we do tomorrow night? 
 Tonight we've got dinner with that woman from DeGraaf's. 
 Roxanna Whitman. Do you know her? 
 Yeah. Yeah, I do. 
 Mason : Tokugawa. 
 I'm flying to Japan to meet with him tomorrow. 
 We'll have it all cataloged by the end of the month. 
 Bruckner? 
 I'm going to... 
 I have a call... Oh! 
 After you. 
 Thank you. 
 I have a call with him later today to discuss potential terms. We're getting close. 
 That sounds great. 
 He invited me to a small get together at his place on Thursday. 
 I'm going to close him then. 
 So, getting close. 
 You two need to coordinate your efforts. 
 Yes, sir. 
 Understood. 
 Moving on. Colemans. 
 I heard DeGraaf's beat us to them. 
 No, sir. They're still in play. 
 I'm going to take them out to dinner tomorrow night. 
 That's good to hear. Let's not let this get away. 
 I won't. 
 Graham. Hey. 
 Hey. 
 I'm closing out the paperwork for the Davenport auction, but there's a dealer I can't seem to find. 
 Joseph Huntzinger in Geneva. 
 His name is on the bill of sale for the gold crown, but there's no listing or license number. 
 Not a problem. I'll track it down for you. 
 Thanks. 
 Allison : Roxanna, thank you again for dinner the other night. 
 Of course. 
 Ah! 
 Are you okay? 
 I'm fine. 
 This happens every meal. 
 My OB/GYN says it's nothing to worry about. 
 Then again, he says that about everything. 
 If you need a recommendation, my sister loved her OB/GYN. 
 Sharon Rosenbach. 
 She's just around the corner. One of the best in the city. 
 Oh, that's very kind, but that's not why I'm here. 
 Of course. 
 Allison, I could quote you our successful stats on rare coin auctions. 
 Every house can do that. 
 But your account is unique. It's literally a dream come true, and I think we should capitalize on that image. 
 Really turn your auction into an event. 
 How do you do that? 
 For starters, I have spoken to CNN and they would love to interview you and Brian. 
 CNN? 
 Yes. 
 Really? 
 Mm-hmm. 
 (stuttering) I wouldn't know what to say, what to wear. 
 Don't worry. We can get you an on-camera coach, and as for the wardrobe... 
 John, can you bring the car around in about 20 minutes? 
 Thanks so much. 
 We can start at Bloomingdale's and make our way uptown. 
 Oh, no, no, Roxanna. I can't let you do that. 
 It's part of my expense account. 
 If I'm not spending enough money, they think I'm not doing my job. 
 Come on. You deserve to be spoiled. 
 I am. 
 My husband spoils me. 
 Not with expensive things, but in the ways that matter to me. 
 You're a lucky woman. 
 The coins have been appraised at 10 million and the couple has a great human interest story, which should generate a lot of free press for us. 
 Where are we with the Swift Collection? 
 Do you have the catalog finished? 
 The volume isn't quite as extensive as we had hoped. 
 But I'm confident that once... 
 What about the Van Gogh? 
 I told Art & Auction that we'd get them a photo, which we're going to need for the catalog cover. 
 I thought we should have the photography department do it. 
 All right. Well, schedule that soon. They go to press in three weeks. 
 Of course. 
 (sighing) Tell me about it. 
 The Van Gogh? 
 Mm-hmm. 
 Well... my guess is that it's from 1888 or '89. 
 The setting and use of color would indicate his Arles period. 
 A landscape. 
 You know, everyone here is very impressed with the way you've applied yourself this last year. 
 And now that includes me. 
 Thanks, Dad. 
 How much do you think you can get for it? 
 50,000. 
 The mask will command much more if ever you can find it. 
 It's not lost. I just haven't had a chance to retrieve it. 
 Hey, Uzay and Demir are not to be played with. You know this. 
 I'll handle it. 
 50,000 for the vase. 
 It's not enough. Not split four ways. 
 We have to sell the mask, too. 
 I understand. But if we move too fast, we get caught. 
 It's not us I'm worried about! 
 Your family. 
 How're they holding up? 
 I have no idea. 
 I haven't heard from them in weeks. 
 Here we are. 
 It was so weird that you called. 
 Derrick was asking about you just the other day. 
 Oh, really? How is he? 
 Fine. 
 And I told him I left messages for you over the last few months, but apparently you didn't get them. 
 I know. I'm sorry. 
 It's just work has been so crazy. 
 Forget about it. 
 But you're good? 
 Yeah. 
 Clean? 
 18 months. 
 You? 
 Three years in June. 
 That's great. 
 So now that our "Twelve Step" bullshit's out of the way, what's going on? 
 That painting your father gave you... 
 The Renoir? 
 The fake Renoir? 
 Well, I've never told anyone about it. 
 Every year I think about selling it, never having to worry about Derrick's business again. 
 But I guess that'd be pretty risky. 
 Maybe not. 
 Our Authentications department thought it was legitimate. 
 Well... 
 Does your father still know how to get in touch with the guy who did it? 
 I think so, but... 
 I have a client in a similar situation. 
 Doesn't the program say bad choices have lasting effects? 
 Maybe you should tell your client that. 
 It also says the wrong choices can lead to the right places. 
 Yeah, like I told the cop. I think I saw a guy in a suit that night. 
 Can you describe him? 
 Uh... brown hair. Cute. Well, in the dark anyway. 
 Where did you see him? 
 We were coming off the ferry. 
 So maybe he and the Arab guy were heading towards it. 
 Did you see anything else? Did you hear them say anything? 
 Hmm, they were arguing with each other. 
 I think the Arab guy called him Roddy, or Toddy, or something like that... 
 But I was pretty wasted. 
 You check that out? The ferry footage? 
 Now I realize that this CNN thing sounds exciting. 
 But those are not the sort of people who go to auctions. 
 At Parke-Mason we go for a more targeted strategy. 
 We already have several large collectors and coin houses in mind. 
 Private viewings are the smarter play. 
 Okay. 
 But what can it hurt? 
 I mean, there's nothing wrong with a little free publicity, right? 
 Right. 
 But be prepared to start getting calls and visits from long lost cousins with their hands out. 
 That's what'll happen. 
 I didn't think about that. 
 You wanna take a look? 
 No, I... 
 There's a dealership on 11th Avenue. I know the owner. 
 No, that's not the kind of thing I should be focused on right now. 
 Why not? 
 Brian, you don't have to worry about what things cost anymore. 
 Oh, man. 
 That's just not the way I'm wired, Graham. 
 I get it. 
 We can't choose where we start, but we can choose where we end up. 
 Besides, Allison seems to be taking to these new opportunities. 
 Why should she object if you do the same? 
 Have a look. 
 I don't know. 
 Why isn't the Davenport transaction report complete? 
 I asked you for this a week ago. 
 I'm still waiting on some of the contact information from Graham Connor. 
 No, no, no, no, no, I asked you to get the information, not Graham Connor. 
 Don't let the account execs do your work for you. 
 And don't let them stall you either. 
 They're here to make sales. 
 We're here to keep the company out of trouble. 
 Those two things do not always go hand I hand. 
 I'm sorry, Melissa. I'll have that for you right away. 
 Great. 
 sh1t. 
 Miguel : Look at this, little Ryan Connor late again. 
 Look, I know I'm a little behind. 
 Two weeks? You call that a little behind? 
 I've been dealing with some personal sh1t. 
 Once I get it in order, I'll be fixed. 
 Maybe if I remove one of your eyes, you'll see a little clearer on the subject of being late. 
 No, wait. Look, I didn't get to move all of it. 
 But I brought you something more valuable. 
 No, please! Please! No. 
 (grunting) 
 Don't be such a pussy. 
 My mama's gotten deeper cuts shaving her legs. 
 Now show me what you got, or I take your eye. 
 A mask? 
 What is this, Halloween? 
 Look, my brother. He brought it home from the place he works. 
 They sell all kinds of expensive sh1t there. 
 Do I look like a goddamn art collector? 
 Just check it out. I'm telling you, he hid it real well. 
 It's got to be worth a lot. 
 I'll tell you what you're gonna do. 
 Get this over to Caesar's. 
 You pick up the plata he owes me. 
 Don't screw this up... or next time I'll finish what I started. 
 Looks great in the driveway. 
 You ready for the viewing? We have a lot... 
 Cancel it. 
 What do you mean? Brian! 
 Brian! 
 What's going on? Who are you? 
 Agent Keith Mitchell. U.S. Treasury Department. 
 We have reason to believe that the coins that Mister and Missus Coleman dug up were part of a robbery that took place at the Philadelphia Mint in 1899. 
 1899? Well, I can guarantee you it wasn't them. 
 Well, we need to examine the coins to determine the exact origin. 
 Now you have to cease any effort to sell the contents of the find... until we can determine true ownership. 
 Our lawyers have gone over it a dozen times. 
 They say that the government's case is all circumstantial. 
 So, if we can come up with something concrete their case falls apart. 
 So the Colemans will be all right? 
 Yeah, someday, but the government could tie this up for years. 
 And legal won't spend any more time on it since it's not our account yet. 
 So what I'm getting at in a roundabout way is, do you feel like playing detective again? 
 Oh, now you really owe me. 
 Thank you. 
 Mm-hmm. 
 Okay, so... we got 1447 coins and 50 years from the date of the oldest coin to the date of the theft. 
 Somewhere in there we need to find the record of a sale. 
 Thank you. 
 How soon can you get answers for me? 
 As soon as I'm done with the Davenport account. 
 I've already started making inquiries in Geneva. 
 You don't need to waste time on that. 
 Davenport'll be able to clear it up in 10 minutes. Just focus. 
 I really don't want to piss off Melissa any more than I already have. 
 (cell phone buzzing) 
 Everything all right, Ma? 
 What? 
 Jesus, are you serious? 
 Yeah, just sit tight. I'm on my way. 
 Ah, my brother had an accident. 
 I'm going to have to catch up with you this afternoon. 
 Jeez, is he okay? 
 Yeah, just a concussion. My Ma is kind of freaking out. 
 Yeah, go, go. I got this. 
 Thank you. 
 Yeah. 
 You're welcome. 
 I didn't ask you to bail me out. 
 Why were you at a tweaker pad? 
 Are you using, or dealing? Or both? 
 Just relax, all right? I flushed it. They got no case. 
 So, you're dealing. For Tony Rago? 
 I asked you a goddamn question! 
 Are you dealing for Rago? 
 No. 
 I work for Miguel, Miguel works for Rago. 
 You do know that Rago's a lieutenant for the Moreno family? 
 These people don't play, Ryan! 
 So? Everybody works for somebody. 
 You screw up again, they'll kill you. 
 Look, has it ever occurred to you that I'm good at what I do? 
 That they value me? 
 What value? 
 You're a runner! Any dumb sh1t can do that! 
 Look, you're my brother. 
 And whether you believe me or not, I'm worried about you. 
 Bullshit. You're worried about yourself. 
 I need the mask back. 
 What mask? 
 The one you stole from the basement! 
 Yeah? What family are you mixed up with? 
 I need that goddamn mask back! 
 Where is the mask? 
 I gave it to Miguel. 
 I had to. I owed him a lot of money. 
 Get off! Get off me! Get your hands off me! 
 Get off me! I just want to talk to you. I want to talk to you. 
 Look who it is. Brave coming up in here. 
 My brother gave you something that belongs to me. 
 He paid a debt. The way he did, that's your problem. Not mine. 
 I need that mask back. Right now. 
 You should bounce while you can, Tommy. 
 Look, if I don't get that mask back, people a lot more dangerous than me are going to come for it. 
 (laughing) 
 Who's coming? 
 Your badass art buddies going to come rough us up? 
 Don't underestimate people with money. 
 'Cause they hire guys to do what they can't. 
 I don't got it no more. 
 Well, who does? 
 Yeah, okay. 
 A friend. 
 I may be able to get it back... but it'll cost you. 
 Okay. 
 Okay, do it. 
 I'll give you five large for the trouble. 
 You'll give me 20... and a favor. 
 I know this is very difficult for the two of you, but now is not the time to panic. Okay? I have the top experts... 
 (doorbell ringing) 
 The government has a team of lawyers and experts! 
 How are we going to compete with that? 
 So we just walk away. That's your solution? 
 Thank God you're here. I can use some re-enforcements. 
 Graham, why don't you tell them? 
 Tell them. This could take years. Cost us a fortune. 
 Well, not necessarily. I've been reviewing the... 
 I will get concrete proof for you. 
 Brian : You don't know that. 
 And the offer is only good until next Friday! 
 What offer? 
 The government has offered us a $100,000 finder's fee if we give away our claim to the coins. 
 $100,000 for a 10 million dollar collection? 
 A stolen collection! 
 Hang on. Let us get all the details. 
 We don't have time. The offer is only good... 
 They'll make that offer again. 
 Brian : How do you know? This is our life you're gambling with. 
 Well, Miss Whitman is right. 
 The investigation'll cost them more than that in time and overhead. 
 That's $100,000 right now. That pays off our house. 
 What about that new Porsche that you leased without even telling me? 
 Could you give us a minute, please? 
 Of course. 
 Why does that bother you so much? 
 I'm not the one who went to Bloomingdale's... 
 Do you have anything useful? 
 Why should I tell you? 
 Because if the coins are stolen, there's no account. 
 Who do you want to win, the government or us? 
 There is no us. I'm here on behalf of DeGraaf's. 
 (arguing in distance) 
 Do you really want to see that couple break up? 
 Oh, please. Do you expect me to believe you actually care about them? 
 I care about the account, and we're running out of time. 
 Do you have anything useful? 
 Maybe. 
 No, you don't. 
 If you did, you wouldn't be asking me. 
 And if you did, you wouldn't be asking me. 
 Look, I propose we pool our resources. 
 The first priority is to keep them from taking the government's offer. 
 If they hear it from both of us they're more likely to believe it. 
 And if I agree? Then what? 
 Then we prove the coins weren't stolen. 
 Who gets the account? 
 That's up to the happy couple now, isn't it? 
 Don't you have to clear this with Mason? 
 He trusts me. 
 Not from what I hear. 
 I guarantee you, whatever you think you know about me is wrong. 
 I doubt it. My sources are very reliable. 
 Bullshit. 
 Nobody you talk to knows anything about me. 
 Really? Not even Arthur Davenport? 
 You got a deal. 
 Now let's go help that lovely couple. 
 Have you been talking to Roxanna about me? 
 I think all your extra-curricular activities with Hassan are making you paranoid, dear boy. 
 You didn't answer the question! 
 Did Roxanna reveal some private confidence that only you and I would know? 
 (sighs) 
 No. 
 No. Well, then I rest my case. 
 She's playing with you, Graham. 
 Trying to divide us. 
 Only effective if you fall for her lies. 
 I'd advise against retaliation. 
 Roxanna can be ruthless, if she thinks you're a threat. 
 So, if you want to gain an advantage... let her think that you're not. 
 Oh, for God's sake! 
 Yeah, I got it. I got it. 
 It's just a glass of wine. I got it. 
 No, it's not. 
 It's a 2006 Pichon Lalande. 
 
 
 
 I'm sorry to keep you waiting. 
 Busy day. 
 You have the item? 
 We have a photo. 
 Let me see it. 
 Sumerian. Seventh century BC? 
 Eighth. 
 Nice piece. 
 My cousin Anton is an art dealer. 
 It's a dirty business. 
 Not for me. 
 My man in Odessa... had good things to say about you. 
 Said you always... delivered. 
 Leonid is a good customer. 
 We made a lot of money for each other. 
 He doesn't talk? 
 No, he doesn't. 
 I have a client. 
 He collects such things. 
 If he is interested, I will pay you the 50,000. 
 I know you don't want to be bothered with any of this, but I'm out of options. 
 When was the last time you heard from him? 
 Oh, not since he made his bail. 
 I checked his room this morning. A lot of his stuff is gone. 
 Well, he's a grown man, Ma. 
 Maybe he just decided he needed a place of his own. 
 If he doesn't make that appearance date... 
 Tommy, he's not like you! 
 He's not going to survive in prison. 
 Oh, you think I don't know the garbage that goes on in here? 
 Tried his cell lately? 
 Disconnected. 
 He keeps changing it, just like you used to. 
 Do you want me to help, or you want to talk about the past? 
 He needed your help when he was 12. 
 Now it's too late! 
 Global warming my fault, too? 
 Maybe he needed your help. You ever think of that? 
 I'll talk to him. 
 I'll point him in the right direction. 
 Don't make promises you can't keep. 
 I've had enough of that from the men in my life. 
 (cell phone buzzing) 
 Graham : I'm meeting with a coin expert in the morning. 
 He keeps an archive of private sales going back to the Civil War. 
 If we can find a sales record for those coins that the Treasury doesn't have, we've proven our claim. 
 Good idea. I'm meeting a guy later tonight. 
 I'll have him start digging as well. 
 Do you want to get together tomorrow after my meeting and compare notes? 
 Come on. The Colemans are on the verge of cracking. 
 They take that offer, we're both screwed. 
 Fine. 11:00. 
 Daugherty's Tavern on Varick. 
 That's out of the way. 
 You don't want to be seen with me? 
 Actually, it's one of my favorite places in the city. 
 Unpretentious. 
 Daugherty's it is. 
 (cell phone buzzing) 
 I got another call. I'll see you tomorrow. 
 Yeah? 
 It's been dealt with. I'll have the mask with me. 
 Just tell Demir and Uzay to relax. 
 I'll meet you tonight. 
 Yeah, I get it, Hassan. Just keep them busy until tonight. I'll have it then. 
 Nice ride. 
 Get in. 
 I thought the party was at your place. 
 It is. My place on Martha's Vineyard. 
 I got a plane waiting for us. Now get in the car! 
 (Belinda speaking in Italian) 
 (Belinda speaking in French) 
 Sure as hell beats flying coach, huh? 
 Sam, I need to let the office know how long I'll be gone. 
 I have meetings tomorrow. 
 Accounts more important than mine? 
 No, of course not. I just need to know how much of my schedule to push. 
 What's this? 
 It's a white party. If it doesn't fit, you're on your own. 
 Captain Desmond. Kick the tires, light the fires. Two minutes. Let's go. 
 Come on, get on the plane. 
 Have a drink. Get a foot massage. 
 Let's see how well you roll with the punches. 
 (dance music playing) 
 What is that? 
 Flakka. 
 Stimulation, for the body and the mind. 
 No, I'm good. 
 I'm stimulated enough. Thank you. 
 You're new... to these parties. 
 Yeah, you can tell? 
 You're a regular? 
 Ah, when my services are needed. 
 Sam likes and pays for the best. 
 In all things. 
 Like this. Egyptian. 
 First century BC. 
 You a collector? 
 Well... 
 I've been known to pick up a select piece or two. 
 You have to be able to admire something that has been able to survive for 2000 years. 
 Yeah, if only they could talk, huh? 
 It's better this way. 
 The mystery. That's part of why I like it. 
 Let me try that. 
 You know, I recently came across a few items you might be interested in. 
 I see. 
 But just like what goes on between these walls... we need to be discreet about it. 
 Hey. 
 Well, at least you didn't have to crash this time. 
 Glad to see someone's moving up in the world. 
 Yeah, and based on a conversation I just had, you're going to be moving up, too. 
 Does that mean you've actually done something? 
 I told you I would. 
 So, what was the conversation? 
 Ah, now's not really the time. 
 How about we get together later? 
 Forget it. That was a one time deal. 
 I really am working on it. 
 You better be. 'Cause I'm not the only one who's running out of time. 
 What's that supposed to mean? 
 Everything set for the meeting with the London team? 
 Waiting to hear on times from them. 
 Don't ever begin a sentence with the word "waiting." 
 Go get on their ass now. 
 Nice to see you again, Belin... 
 Don't distract the help. 
 There's plenty of other girls I have here for that. All right? 
 Thank you. Not Roxanna. Should I take that as a positive sign? 
 No. 
 I am extremely good at reading people. 
 In fact, a TV exec friend of mine tells me that I'm so good at it, I should have my own show. 
 The point I'm trying to make here, Graham, is that you have got your ass wound way too tight for your own good. 
 You can't maximize your performance if you are fretting about every little thing all the time. 
 Michael Jordan said that whenever he stepped onto a court, all of his stress would just melt away. 
 I'll try and remember that. 
 Loosen up. All right? 
 This is a place you can come, have fun, go wild. 
 No repercussions. 
 There's always repercussions. That's the problem. 
 Let's take a walk. 
 How about this view, huh? 
 You know, 30, 40 years ago, half the houses here didn't exist. 
 I knew that couldn't last. So, I started buying land. 
 But there was this one local developer, Bertram Cromwell. 
 Old money prick. Tried to block me. 
 Told all the locals, (mocking) "Don't sell to that shit-kicker from Indiana. 
 Sell to me, you're blue-blooded, inbred third cousin." 
 So what... What happened? 
 Turned out old Bert had, um, some skeletons in the closet. 
 You know, he had tax problems. 
 Somehow the IRS got wind of it. 
 (sighs) Look, Graham, I want to let you in on a little secret. 
 This whole auction is just part of a larger re-branding strategy that is going to take me from Sam Brukner, real estate genius to Sam Brukner, crusader for the public good. 
 How can I help with that, Sam? 
 Tell me what you need and I'll do it. 
 Well, as you know, some of my collection, it didn't come through the normal channels. 
 And if some Bertram Cromwell were to come out of the woodwork, whoever works with me would have to be ready for that. 
 I can deal with trouble. 
 That's not a problem. 
 Parke-Mason is a public company. 
 That's going to mean more scrutiny. 
 I got an in with the Authentications department. 
 Which is something Roxanna can't offer. 
 Roxanna can offer quite a lot. 
 Well, can she? 
 Or does she just pretend so she can string you along? 
 If that's what you want, keep playing that game. 
 But if you want somebody who isn't afraid to do anything necessary... then go with me. 
 Okay. Enough business. 
 Let's go get laid. 
 Yeah, you're right. 
 It's unpretentious. 
 It's too bad the clientele's so shady. 
 (sighs) The Colemans just called me, to let me know they signed with you. 
 Don't be bitter. You had your chance. 
 And we had a deal. 
 We were supposed to share information then let them decide. 
 Well, while I was busy getting the Treasury Department to drop their case against the Colemans, you chose to go partying with Brukner. 
 How'd that work out for you? 
 It'll work out. 
 Maybe. Maybe not. 
 One of our lawyers has a contact at the Treasury. I saw your proof. 
 Good. Hope you learned something. 
 Learned something? 
 Hmm. 
 A bill of sale from 1896? You got that idea from me. 
 Actually, my coin expert found it through a diligent document search. 
 Yeah? 
 Mm-hmm. 
 What happens when it turns out to be a fake? 
 But it's not. 
 The Treasury's already signed off on it... and I have a contract with the Colemans. 
 Hurts to lose a client, doesn't it? 
 (Graham scoffs) 
 Mason : Sutherlands? 
 The catalog proofs will be ready for your review today. 
 Colemans? 
 Ah, the Treasury investigation's heating up. 
 Authentications has reviewed the collection, has concerns and I have to agree. 
 I say we step away and let DeGraaf's get humiliated. 
 Thanks to you and your staff for the great work. 
 I think because of you and Elizabeth, we dodged a bullet. 
 Nice to know we're actually listened to once in a while. 
 Wexler? 
 (Graham clearing throat) 
 Oh, sorry. 
 Hey. 
 Hey. 
 I just wanted to thank you for your help on the Coleman account. 
 What do you mean? I didn't find anything. 
 Yeah, but you opened my eyes to the risk. 
 That's your job and you did it well. 
 So, accept the compliment please. 
 Well, Melissa was pleased. 
 She said you gave us full credit at the staff meeting. 
 Yeah, I did. So, you know... 
 Want to get a drink tonight and celebrate? 
 Ooh, be careful with that. 
 It'll rot you from the inside out. 
 I wasn't going to drink. That's just stupid. 
 DeGraaf's closed the account before you could, didn't they? 
 Yeah, they did. 
 Does that disqualify me from a celebratory drink? 
 Yes. It does. 
 Okay. 
 Because... 
 I think after a day like today, it qualifies us for several drinks. 
 That's not fair. You can't do that. 
 I thought you were blowing me off. 
 Elizabeth : So, where to next? 
 Graham : Next? 
 We've already closed three bars. 
 I know Marines that can't throw back like you do. 
 You know what we used to call a night like this back in prep school? 
 Tuesday. 
 So come on. I know a bar on Reade that doesn't close until 5:00 a.m. 
 5:00? 
 This is payback for you lying to me. 
 Hey. 
 Whoo! 
 I'm really sorry about that. 
 Relax. I'm just giving you sh1t. 
 I know all the execs do it. 
 Yeah. 
 I was trying to close an account, but that's no excuse. 
 What? 
 It used to be that when I was around art, I was at peace. 
 Even over in Iraq. 
 It made me feel closer to my dad, too. 
 Now when I'm around art, it's work. 
 And it makes me... 
 It makes me do things I wouldn't want my dad to see. 
 You know, when I was in college, I used to lie my ass off and I didn't even have a job as an excuse. 
 So prep school was about drinking and college was all about lying? 
 Okay. It almost sounds bad when you put it that way. 
 Maybe we'll be good influences on each other. 
 I could use that. 
 Graham, we work together. 
 And I am at least trying to be a grown-up, so can we just... take a minute and not rush into anything? 
 Yeah, okay. (laughs) 
 Wanna go for a swim? 
 Come on. 
 Yeah! You first. 
 Come on, let's go. 
 To Reade? 
 One drink. 
 You got the balls to come into my home! Get out of here! 
 Where is the vase? 
 I went to the auto shop and it wasn't there. 
 I sold it. I'll bring you the money in the morning. 
 I just made a deal for it with a man you don't want to disappoint. 
 You did what? 
 Get in here. 
 Where do you get off making deals? 
 Our buyer. He likes to chop off the fingers of people that dare to reach into his pocket. 
 So maybe you should be the one that tells him the vase is gone. 
 I'll give you his address. 
 Better yet, I'll give him yours. 
 (sighs) Does it have to be the vase? 
 You have the mask? 
 I'll have it tomorrow. 
 Fine. Then I'll set up the exchange. 
 Pray he agrees. 
 A studio and no doorman. 
 I expected better from you, Tommy. 
 (keys clattering) 
 (sighing)
