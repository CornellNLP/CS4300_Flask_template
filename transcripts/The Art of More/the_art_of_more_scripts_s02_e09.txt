 Roxanna :  Previously on  The Art of More. 
 (gunshot) 
 I need to find this woman and her son for a friend. 
 Vashti, my name's Graham Connor. 
 I'm a friend of Hassan's, okay? 
 I'm gonna get you out of here. Come on, come on. 
 I have relapse-remitting multiple sclerosis. 
 Baby, I'm your father. 
 My father who I see once a year if his work schedule permits it. 
 Mr. Sudha, your firm will put up the money and buy out the shareholders? 
 (in video recording)  And I hate this building. 
 Navin Sudha was very shocked to see this. 
 Pack your bags, Roxy. 
 Sam :  Do I work for you or do you work for me? 
 One of us has forgotten. 
 Why don't you go piss away the rest of your inheritance on some boy toy, okay? 
 Man :  I'm a huge Ruscha fan. 
 My gallery specializes in similar artists. 
 Let me give you my card. 
 Thank you. 
 I'll give you a call. 
 Rice. That is the only name you need to be thinking about right now. 
 Set up the deal. 
 Sunday works fine. 
 Graham :  What about finding Uzay? 
 Ramirez :  Yeah, I got priorities, Graham. 
 And that's the way it's gonna be till you help me bring down that terrorist-funding asshole, Paul Rice. 
 You don't come to me here. 
 Hear me out. 
 (thunder rumbling) 
 Your mom said you cut class again. 
 That right? 
 Were you with Lizzy? 
 Yeah. 
 You using protection? 
 Come on, Dad. 
 All right, all right, but when you do, make sure you use a rubber. 
 That talk about it not feeling as good... 
 Well, it's true, but 30 seconds of heaven ain't worth getting locked down for a lifetime. 
 Trust me. 
 Grab me another. 
 (thunder crashing) 
 That said... you want to get Lizzy to drop her panties? 
 Take the Shadow. 
 Are you serious? 
 One time. 
 Here's what you do. 
 Pick Lizzy up, tell her you stole it. 
 Bring a six-pack, and take her for a ride out to the lake. 
 Think you can handle that? 
 You gonna buy the six-pack? 
 Promise me one thing though. 
 Stop ditching school. 
 I want more for you than being some... broke mechanic, okay? 
 Ah, sh1t. 
 Here. 
 Don't tell your mom. 
 (crackling, sizzling) 
 (thump) 
 Dad! 
 (thunder crashes) 
 It's a 1949 Vincent Black Shadow Series B. 
 There's only a handful of these things left in the world. 
 The last one sold at auction for over 100K, and it wasn't in nearly as good as shape as this. 
 Well, my dad spent over a decade restoring this bike. 
 He'd be rolling over in his grave if he knew I was selling it, but if I don't, we'll lose our house. 
 I'm sorry to hear that. We are expecting a great deal of interest, though, when it goes up on the block. 
 What are the odds that a museum could buy it? 
 I mean, I'd love it if tons of people could see my dad's work and not just one rich guy. 
 Um, if that's important to you, we will put out some feelers. 
 Uh, Roxanna has a relationship with the Smithsonian. 
 Yes, I do. 
 We will find a good home for it. 
 Well, I'm glad I chose DeGraaf's. 
 We feel the same way. 
 We'll put together some estimates, make some calls, and we'll be in touch soon. 
 Thanks so much. Have a nice day. 
 You too. 
 Take care. 
 Um, are you feeling okay today? 
 I'm fine. 
 No, you're not, because normally you would have been all over this account. 
 DeGraaf's is being sold to a Chinese company. 
 The only head they want is mine. 
 Well, you can't let them take it. 
 I don't plan to. 
 Ryan : It's all right. It's all right. 
 Graham : Is she any better? 
 Whatever drugs those shit-heads had her on, it could take a few days for her to flush it out. 
 She's gonna be okay, though, right? 
 I don't know. 
 I gave her some clonidine. 
 We should watch her blood pressure and keep an eye on the sweating and vomiting. 
 (Vashti groans) 
 (sighs) 
 Look, I learned a few things in rehab, but I don't really know what I'm doing. 
 What she needs is a hospital. 
 No, no. They'll put 'em straight back in the system and send 'em back to Iraq. 
 Look, you're doing good, okay? 
 (sighs) He asked me if his dad was coming home soon. 
 What'd you say? 
 I didn't. 
 Probably something that should come from his mother. 
 I know. I just gotta tell her. 
 I know. 
 I've seen some bad sh1t in my life, but those assholes... 
 At least the assholes are all dead. 
 Not all of them. 
 I gotta go. Be back in a couple of hours. 
 Hey, where are you going? We should keep our heads down for a couple of days. 
 Be back soon, okay? 
 sh1t. 
 (theme music playing) 
 Ah. 
 Mr. Peng. It's Roxanna Whitman. 
 Miss Whitman. 
 Nice to meet you. 
 I was wondering if we might have a word. 
 Our food just arrived, but you're welcome to sit down and say what you have to say. 
 Of course. 
 (clears throat) 
 I'm not someone who doesn't know when she's been defeated. 
 DeGraaf's is yours. 
 Is this extraordinary grace and defeat after you fought so hard? 
 I came to realize my true goal, which is also my true strength. 
 That is not to own DeGraaf's, but to lead it. 
 We're planning on installing Miles Hewitt as CEO. 
 Pass me a roll? 
 With all due respect, that is the wrong move. 
 He has no vision, no leadership, no character. 
 Whereas I have implemented innovative strategies across the board. 
 (speaks Chinese)_ 
 What? What did you say? 
 What... What did he say? 
 He said it must be fun to be in your family. 
 I'm not joking, Mr. Peng. 
 Why do you hate each other so much? 
 That's not your business. 
 I might have another glass of wine. 
 Mr. Peng, listen to me. 
 You need me. 
 You need me running this company as CEO. 
 Me. 
 Noted, Miss Whitman. 
 Now, if you'll excuse me, I was having a very nice lunch. 
 I look forward to hearing from you. 
 Thank you for your time. 
 All right, I'm pissed off and I'm hungover. What is it? 
 Take it easy, Mr. Brukner. 
 What, is he your mouthpiece now? 
 The deal with Rice is confirmed. 
 They have the inventory, we have the funds. 
 It's gonna happen this week. 
 If for whatever reason Rice does contact you, these are the items you've agreed to buy. 
 You're excited, but you're gonna let Graham handle everything. 
 So what goes down at the deal? 
 Are you gonna arrest him? 
 We take the pieces, we transfer bitcoin into his account, we get him on tape, and then we arrest him. 
 I suggest killing him. 
 That's not how we operate. 
 That's horseshit. 
 We do whatever we want. 
 That's what makes this country great. 
 We want to arrest him. 
 Now study those photos. 
 Relax. Your country thanks you. 
 Graham, let's go. 
 Yeah, just give me a second. 
 I'll see you outside. 
 (door opens, closes) 
 I found out that Rice is connected with Nazari. 
 Oh, now you really have to kill him. 
 I want nothing more, okay? 
 But listen to me, if we kill Rice, we lose the best shot we have at getting Nazari. 
 If we arrest him and he talks, then we all win. 
 Why are you telling me this? 
 You did your part. 
 You deserve to know. 
 Everybody better get what they deserve, Graham. 
 They will. 
 (both speaking Arabic) 
 The store looks good. 
 Our grant opening is next week. 
 Do you need a new suit? 
 No, uh, but I need your help. 
 I put you in touch with al-Masrifi. 
 I told my cousin I'm done with all of this. 
 It's not about al-Masrifi. 
 My friend Hassan, the man you met... he was killed. 
 His wife and son have nowhere to go and there are dangerous people looking for them. 
 I need you to help them find a safe place in the Iraqi community here. 
 Listen, I'm sorry for your friend, really, and I'm grateful for all your help, but I don't want to get involved. 
 Look, I can give you money. I'll give you some money. 
 They're not gonna be a burden. 
 These are good, decent people. 
 They just need a fresh start. 
 Look, what I'm doing with al-Masrifi puts them at risk. 
 Okay? 
 They can't stay with me. 
 Please. 
 Please. 
 And what happens when these people who are looking for them find me? 
 I have a family too. 
 That's not gonna happen. 
 I'm sorry. 
 That's not gonna happen. 
 I'm sorry. 
 What are you doing? 
 Oh, I'm just dropping off a list of pledges I received from the gala. 
 I can take those. 
 Yes. Yes, of course. 
 It's a fair amount of money for the museum. 
 Well, The Brukner thanks you. 
 Do you mean the museum of is that what he has you calling him nowadays? 
 Just kidding. 
 Anything else you need? 
 No, just, uh... please make sure he sees those numbers. 
 I will. 
 Thank you. 
 Roxanna : Charles. 
 Excellent bike, am I right? 
 It's in fantastic condition. 
 Well, my father took great pride in it, and, uh, since he passed, caring for it has been my way of staying close to him. 
 Well, the Smithsonian would love to take up that responsibility. 
 How much are you able to offer? 
 I'd be willing to match the previous top sale of 100,000. 
 Well, we were hoping for more. 
 I'm afraid that's as high as I'm authorized to go. 
 (whispering) 
 Uh, if you'll excuse me for a moment. 
 Thank you. 
 Well, uh, we've been getting a lot of interest in the bike. 
 Mr. Peng. It's good to see you again. 
 Hi, Roxanna. 
 Simon gave me the heads up that you came to see him yesterday. 
 I did. I was hoping to enlighten him. 
 Yeah? Well, he's since enlightened me. 
 I'm gonna pay it forward and enlighten you. 
 If Mr. Peng has something to tell me, he can do it himself. 
 I appreciate your request yesterday, but the fact is Miles brought Jianwun this opportunity. 
 I have to honor that. 
 You're out, Roxanna. 
 Congratulations, Miles. 
 You have successfully taken everything from me. 
 I was only defending myself. 
 I am better than you. 
 I am so much better than you. 
 Well, not today. 
 Please leave. 
 (sighs) 
 What are we drinking? 
 Bourbon. 
 Pour me one? 
 Oh, come on. I'm a big girl. 
 I can make my own decisions. Hey... 
 I'm not your booze cop. 
 Here. 
 I'll pour another. 
 Thank you. 
 (sighs) 
 I need you to buy DeGraaf's. 
 Excuse me? What? 
 If you come in at $48 per share, Jianwun will take the deal. 
 It'll be the easiest money they ever made. 
 What are you talking about? 
 Jianwun just bought DeGraaf's. 
 But with your help, we can take it back. 
 You want me to just buy an auction house? 
 Yeah. I brought a presentation. 
 I can show you if you just sit down. 
 What? What? 
 Are you serious? 
 Yes, of course I'm serious. 
 Give me five minutes. Sit down, and I will show you. 
 Roxy. Hey, hey, stop. Stop. 
 I got other things that I'm dealing with right now. 
 Like what? 
 Like none of your business. 
 (sighs) 
 Sam... please. 
 They're firing me. 
 Oh. 
 (sighs) 
 Why did you not come to me before? 
 I didn't want things... to become more complicated... 
 Hm. 
 ...between us. 
 Hm. 
 In other words, you were afraid I was gonna ask you for something in return and you didn't want to do that. 
 That's the way you think of me. 
 (sighs) I think the world of you, Sam. 
 That is why I'm here. 
 Honey, you're here to save your own ass. 
 You took a fall, and you want me to pick up your sh1t just like before, but I can't do that anymore. 
 That's not my place. 
 I'm sorry that you lost DeGraaf's, but... that's business. 
 That's what happens in business. 
 What am I supposed to do? 
 Quit? 
 How are you gonna quit? 
 You got fired. 
 Thanks, Sam. 
 Thanks a lot. 
 (door opens, closes) 
 (door buzzes) 
 So anytime in the next 24 hours? 
 Yeah. 
 And Rice's thug didn't say when? 
 No. All he said is they'd be in touch with the location one hour before the meet is gonna go down. 
 Okay. 
 "Okay"? 
 I'm going out of my f*cking mind here. 
 Rice knows where I live. 
 Listen, you'll be safe, all right? 
 We'll be with you every step of the way. 
 You cannot make that promise. 
 Rice is in control. 
 Uh-uh. 
 Same as last time. 
 All right, mic is in the button and there's a GPS locater in the heel of that shoe. 
 Didn't know a perk was getting a whole new wardrobe, huh? 
 You got anything in wingtip? Not exactly my style. 
 Yeah, I don't give a sh1t. Just keep them with you 24/7 in case we don't have time to meet before the deal goes down. 
 Anything else? 
 Yeah. Keep your head in the game. 
 We need you ready for anything. 
 Mr. Millain, after all my years of experience, I can assure you, an auction is best for you and your family. 
 What about the Smithsonian's offer? 
 They were low-balling you. 
 They'll come up once they know there's some competition. 
 But doesn't that mean that someone else might buy the bike? 
 If they don't open up their wallet, they don't deserve your father's motorcycle. 
 Rest assured, I'm gonna get you the most money possible. 
 Oh, did you really think that we'd let you leave without saying goodbye? 
 I was hoping you might. 
 Ha! No such luck. 
 Do you want me to gather everyone? 
 I didn't make a speech when I got the job. 
 No sense in making one now. 
 You know how I feel. 
 I'm proud of the work we accomplished in such a short amount of time. 
 I wish it could have been longer. 
 Me too. 
 All this stuff is very popular these days. 
 You'll get a great price, across the board. 
 So what's the deal? Are you preserving your dad's legacy or taking the cash? 
 Ideally both. 
 No. You have to choose. 
 Roxanna... 
 Shut up, Miles. 
 Money comes and goes. 
 If that motorcycle is really your dad's legacy, you gotta protect it. 
 Mr. Millain, I apologize. 
 Sorry for being so blunt. 
 But he just fired me, so I figured what the hell. 
 Bye. 
 Bye. 
 (sighs) 
 Easy. 
 Take it easy. 
 I was making Ammar lunch. 
 Thank you. 
 He loves cheese sandwiches. 
 (faucet running) 
 
 
 
 I need to talk to you about something. 
 About Hassan. 
 He's dead, isn't he? 
 I just knew. I felt it days ago. 
 He... he... he was shot by the cop that took you. - Please. 
 I can't. 
 We'll leave tomorrow. 
 No, no, you don't have to do that. 
 You don't have to do that. 
 I've seen the way you are constantly in and out, pacing, looking at your phone. 
 It isn't good for us here. 
 I'm reaching out to some friends and I'm gonna find you a place to stay. 
 Why are you helping us? 
 You shouldn't have to ask that. 
 I didn't think you and Hassan were friends. 
 Yeah, we were. 
 I know he lied to you. 
 He was only trying to get us a better life. 
 The fool. 
 You're gonna have a better life here. 
 I promise you. 
 You can't make that promise. 
 Davenport : As you can imagine, with that kind of history, I couldn't resist buying it. 
 Would you, uh, like to hold it? 
 Uh, it's a beautiful piece, Mr. Davenport, but no man is invincible, not even with a magical sword. 
 Yes, right, of course. 
 Information is the best weapon these days, and that's what I defend myself with. 
 And that's why I wanted to see you today. 
 I don't take to blackmail, Mr. Davenport. 
 You misunderstand me, Reverend. 
 I'm offering you information. 
 Sam Brukner is not being entirely honest with you about his museum plans. 
 Well, last I checked, you work for him. 
 If Brukner had his way, he'd have us all working for him, and that's a mistake. 
 He needs to learn that he's not invincible. 
 I'm down at the museum. 
 Supervising. 
 Hey, Noah. 
 Uh, how'd you get my number? 
 Look there's no need for us both to be here at once. 
 (chuckles) 
 Nothing's wrong. 
 No, I haven't been avoiding you. 
 Isabel, look, I'm running a company, I am building a museum, and I have a daughter who just got out of the hospital. 
 That... Forgive me for being short. 
 What are you... Oh, sh1t. 
 No, not you. Listen, it... it... it's kind of a bad time, okay? 
 I'm about to meet my dad. I'll call you back. Okay, bye. 
 Here. 
 Who was that? 
 Nobody. 
 You mind explaining the driver you forced on me? 
 Well, you wrecked my car. 
 I got you a driver. 
 So why is he built like a security guard? 
 I don't know. He works out. 
 His name is Claude. 
 Was that Isabel? She break it off with you? 
 No, she did not. 
 She just wants it to be s*x. That's all. 
 (chuckles) 
 You enjoying that? 
 Talking about your s*x life? 
 Yeah. 
 Hell no. 
 Yeah. 
 Watching you squirm, shoe firmly on the other foot? 
 Hell yes. 
 Are you happy being her little escape? 
 What are you saying? I'm a booty call? 
 Is that it? 
 Yeah, it's kind of what you are. 
 Can we just not talk about Isabel right now? 
 I didn't bring you down here for that. 
 I want you to see the museum. 
 You didn't get to see it the last time. 
 It's pretty great. 
 Cut the bullshit. 
 Why the linebacker/driver? 
 Sweetheart, as you know, I'm a very rich, powerful man, and I attract a lot of crazies that make threats. 
 It's nothing to worry about, okay? 
 Put up with it. 
 If you're trying to protect me, why not send me farther away? 
 That's not a possibility right now. 
 No. 
 In fact, I think I should work here, for your company. 
 Really? 
 I've been reading some of your paperwork. 
 You have a lot of projects coming up. I could be helpful to you. 
 What, you want to learn the business? 
 Yeah. 
 Yeah? 
 All right. Baby steps. 
 You can start out by taking a tour of the museum, and Claude will be your guide. Come on. 
 Come on. 
 He's very helpful with those hard-to-reach things. 
 Come on. 
 Mr. Millain. 
 Have a look. 
 Impressive, right? 
 Up to 120. 
 It's only an estimate. 
 It will almost certainly go for even more. 
 I've already spoken to one of the biggest collectors out there. 
 He's got five other Vincent Black Shadows and he's dying to get his hands on yours. 
 Um... 
 I'm gonna take the Smithsonian's offer. 
 Oh. 
 You're not hung up on what Roxanna said, are you? 
 I am, actually. 
 Oh. 
 That's gonna cost you a lot of money. 
 And you. 
 Now, if you won't make the sale, then I'll find someone who will. 
 I'm surprised you called. 
 Why the change of heart? 
 My wife reminded me how hard it was for us when we first arrived. 
 Shouldn't make it hard on someone else. 
 (both speaking Arabic) 
 Marwan, this is Vashti and Ammar al Afshar. 
 (speaking Arabic) 
 As I said, Marwan is a very well-respected businessman in the area. 
 And he also has a family too. 
 My daughter is nearly your age, Ammar. 
 And my wife is excited to meet you both. 
 I'm sure Allah will get you a job and help you find your own place. 
 Hey, maybe one day we could catch a Red Bulls game together. 
 Cool? 
 Okay. 
 (phone vibrates) 
 Sorry. 
 Graham Connor. 
 2862 Mead Street. 
 One hour. 
 You gonna have everything? 
 As long as you do. 
 Done. 
 I'll see you there. 
 You're still doing deals. 
 Just one more. 
 Okay. 
 Testing, testing. 
 Please do not get me killed. 
 Yeah, don't get yourself killed. 
 Nice shoes, by the way. Very classy. 
 Just trying to take the edge off. 
 We need you to go in there relaxed. 
 Don't worry, the Valium should be kicking in any minute. 
 Testing, testing. Jesus. 
 We good? 
 Yeah, we're good. 
 Nighthawk is wired and ready to go. 
 "Nighthawk"? 
 That's my code name? 
 Oh, it's a nod to Edward Hopper. 
 Only artist I ever got into. 
 That's cute. 
 You're gonna have cameras watching me, right? 
 We didn't want to send a tech in early in case they're watching the building, but we'll have eyes on all the entrances and the exits. 
 And what if we leave? 
 Military's not the only one with a drone. 
 This is the bitcoin wallet where all the money is stored. 
 Password is also "Nighthawk." 
 It's set up like a mixer account, so he can withdraw the money, but he can't see where it's coming from. 
 But, of course, it's our own site so we can track everything. 
 Well, it sounds complicated. 
 Somewhere in D.C., there's a lot of smart people who come up with this sh1t. 
 And yet you get the walkie-talkie. 
 Yeah, well, we all have our talents. 
 I'm gonna use mine to make sure your ass doesn't take a bullet. 
 You use yours. 
 (sighs) Okay. 
 Let's get this prick. 
 Okay. 
 Babe. 
 I thought you were in the Hamptons till the end of the week. 
 Change of plans. 
 So? 
 What do you think of my new office? 
 What's going on? 
 I filed for divorce this morning. 
 What? 
 I'm leaving you. 
 Oh, no, no. Slow down. 
 Sign those and send them to my lawyer. 
 I don't understand. What's happening? 
 You can speak to my lawyer. 
 I think I'll speak to my wife! 
 I know what you did to Roxanna. 
 (scoffs) 
 I don't know what lies that she's been spreading... 
 I know about Monica too. 
 Monica and Roxanna used to get drunk together. 
 Okay? And one night, they were three sheets when they were supposed to be watching the girls. 
 Those two have had it out for me. You know that. 
 Come on. Just... just think about it. 
 We got too much to lose, right, to get caught up in that bullshit, right? 
 I love you. 
 (mutters) 
 Let go, Miles. 
 Miles, let go. Please. 
 Let go. 
 You have one week to be out of the house. 
 If you come near me, the girls, or Roxanna again, I swear to God I will do everything in my power to send you to jail. 
 Joseph. I wasn't expecting you. 
 Did we, uh, did we have something on the books? 
 No, no. I was going to call, but I thought it would be more fun this way. 
 Are we... 
 Are we going golfing? 
 Well, it looks very nice. 
 But I can't really say if it has any value. 
 It doesn't seem very old. 
 Maybe we could call your appraiser again. 
 He would know. 
 Yes, well, I'm not sure if he deals in sports memorabilia, but, uh, I'm happy to text you his number. 
 I have not played much golf. 
 That and art... two areas of weakness for me. 
 Look how far you've come with art. 
 Indeed. 
 I now know about pop art, and modern impressionism. 
 I even know the true value of a Ruscha. 
 Well, I think someone's been confusing you, Joseph. 
 I've had another appraisal done. 
 Oh? 
 Eight million. 
 That was so much lower than I expected that I had another one done. 
 Eight million again. 
 Well, I think the true value is what someone pays for it. 
 Even when that person is robbed? 
 Look, Joseph, I'm sorry. 
 All right? I... I... I made a mistake. 
 I was in dire financial straits and... you didn't seem to care about the money. 
 (chuckles) You're right. 
 What is money? 
 What are possessions? 
 Wait! 
 We get too hung up on them. 
 No, no, no, no, no, no... 
 Stop, stop. Stop this. 
 We should focus on what matters to us, our health. 
 All right, all right, just... let's calm down. 
 Let's just... let's just keep our feet on the ground. 
 What is it you want? 
 Check, cash, what? 
 I like that one. 
 I will take that one. 
 And that one. And that one, too. 
 You're joking. 
 The Rubens alone is worth more than the Ruscha. 
 Uh-huh. 
 All right. 
 Fine. 
 You go right ahead. 
 I am going to call the police. 
 Tell them what? 
 The man you robbed is robbing you in return? 
 (line ringing) 
 Ha. I don't think so. 
 For 15 years I kept it together, thinking it was okay because my kids didn't know. 
 Well, they never said anything. 
 But they did know. 
 My turning point was when my daughter found me blacked out one morning. 
 I'd been drinking 12 hours straight. 
 Alcohol... always took away my shyness. 
 It made me happy. 
 You can't be here. 
 This is a very important space for me. 
 Please don't ruin it. 
 I didn't want to talk on the phone. 
 What? 
 (sighs) 
 We're so f*cked. 
 I'm sorry. 
 (sighs) 
 It's okay. 
 Graham, why is it always me calling you for an update? 
 Don't leave me hanging here. 
 Call me. 
 Another Coors Light, Sam? 
 Why not, Josie? 
 I heard this was your place. 
 (chuckles) 
 You've got your temple, I've got mine. 
 (chuckles) 
 What's this? 
 It's a list of recent property sales in the neighborhood around your museum. 
 Really? 
 And a strategy letter from your office outlining your plans to redevelop the whole area. 
 Wardell, are you gonna get your dick in a knot over somebody that has a grudge and an imagination? 
 Oh, Sam. 
 You barge into a man's house, you gotta expect a fight. 
 You invited me in. 
 And now I'm kicking your ass out. 
 For starters. 
 "For starters"? 
 (hits table) 
 You forget the influence I wield. 
 The Attorney General has already dropped all the charges against me. 
 I'm not talkin' about politicians. 
 I'm talkin' about the people. 
 You ever had an entire community rise up against you? Hm? 
 Marching, picketing outside your office, outside your home, dogging your every move? 
 I'm gonna rain down a shit-storm on you. 
 I'm gonna ruin you, Brukner. 
 No offense, I thought it would be a bigger party. 
 Shut your mouth. 
 I do the talking here. 
 All right, does anybody hear anything? 
 Mic's still transmitting, but it's just noise. 
 Goddamn it. 
 We need eyes on that garage. 
 What is that? 
 (door slides closed) 
 Is it a car? 
 All right, everybody, there's a change of plans. 
 We're on the move. 
 All right, Nighthawk is in a dark blue van. 
 Units two and three, follow. 
 Copy. 
 (beeping) 
 I feel a bit under-dressed now. 
 You Americans are always under-dressed. 
 Agent :  Two blocks out from the park. 
 Headed for the entrance on Fillmore. 
 This is bullshit. 
 You tell Rice we do the deal just as planned. 
 Do you understand me? 
 No. 
 (music playing) 
 What the hell is that? 
 The van's radio. 
 I don't like this. 
 Should we move in? 
 No. 
 We wait for confirmation of the transfer. 
 (chimes) 
 What the hell is this? 
 Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. 
 Relax. 
 What you want is there. 
 Go ahead. Take a look. 
 Make sure it's all in order. 
 Satisfied? 
 No. 
 No, I'm not. 
 I'm supposed to be doing a deal with Paul. 
 By now you must have noticed we are being cautious. 
 You will give him the money and you can come back for these after. 
 Turning south on 11th, heading towards Long Island City. 
 It's going to be tough to stay discreet. 
 All ground units, use parallel streets. 
 We'll maintain visuals from the sky. 
 I want everybody as close as possible in case something goes wrong and we need to move in. 
 Got it. 
 (elevator chimes) 
 At last. 
 Now we can do our business. 
 Take it easy, kid. This is our customer. 
 Got to work on my new employee training. 
 Maybe he should lose the gun. 
 Maybe I decide what he does with the gun. 
 I'm not armed. 
 Okay? 
 Let's just play fair. 
 Then this should go smoothly. 
 Everything to your liking downstairs? 
 I didn't get too close a look, actually. 
 I was distracted with all the games. 
 Oh. Do you want another look? 
 Yeah. 
 Yeah, a few minutes. 
 Too bad. We're not open all day for browsing. 
 We're either gonna do a deal... or we're not. 
 Okay. 
 Let's do it. 
 Excellent. 
 I showed you mine, now show me yours. 
 Password. 
 I value our business. 
 I'd like it to continue. 
 I'm not gonna shoot you. 
 Don't make me shoot you. 
 The password is "Nighthawk." 
 I'm an Edward Hopper fan. 
 I go back and forth on Hopper. 
 Those lighthouses, they bore me to death. 
 But his cityscapes, ah, brilliant. 
 "Automat," "Summer Interior," "Chop Suey." 
 He made loneliness beautiful. 
 Yeah. 
 Unfortunately, the Hopper directly inspired Rothko, so I got to hold that against him. 
 Right. 
 (chiming) 
 Are we done? 
 Hm. 
 Boom! 
 Sir, it's confirmed the bitcoin transfer went through. 
 He did the transfer en route. 
 Move in. Take 'em. 
 Thank you very much, Mr. Connor. 
 You're free to, uh, take your items now. 
 Uzay will help you. 
 12th floor. Bye now. 
 FBI! Stay down! 
 Agent : We have the driver detained. 
 And Rice? 
 There's no one else in the van. 
 They never left the building. 
 We need to go. Now.
