 1x18 - Gem of a Different Color 
 Let's go, bud. 
 [Toothless roars] 
 [heroic music] 
 Yeah. 
 Wow. 
 Cool. 
 Wow. 
 Wow, nice. 
 That was pretty good. 
 Vikings are strong, tough, and courageous, but courage is a funny thing. Many are born with it. 
 For some, it's a never-ending struggle, and for others, well, they just don't know enough to be afraid. As I've said a million times and as Ruffnut has demonstrated so splendidly, the shield can be your most important weapon. Who's next? Hold on. I don't get to hit her back? On your own time. Hiccup, Astrid. Well, I -I don't think it's really fair for me to be fighting a... [grunts] [gasps] [both grunting] When you're in a situation like this, it's best to remain calm and take deep breaths. When that's not an option, I would advise playing dead... [groans] just like that. Well done, Hiccup. Good form, Astrid. You okay? Never been better. Shoulder should pop back into place in no time. Snotlout, Fishlegs, let's see what you've got. Whoo! I think we all know what I've got. Snotlout, Snotlout, oy, oy, oy! Fishlegs, don't be shy. Vikings can't rely on dragons alone to protect them. Eh, thoughts on Fishlegs' whereabouts? Anyone? What a glorious day, Meatlug. You and me on our own secret island, no dumb old hand-to-hand combat, and, more importantly, not a Snotlout for miles. [wind gusting] [shivers] [i]♪ There once was a dragon named Meatlug ♪ 
♪ she was cuter and smarter than a sea slug ♪ 
♪ when she met her pal fish ♪ 
♪ it fulfilled his greatest wish ♪ 
♪ to love her and give her a big bear hug... ♪ Okay. That was bad, even for me. Really? That bad? What is that? I'm starting to get a little worried about Fishlegs. Do you think he's okay? He looks okay to me. [wings beating] Is Fishlegs glowing? Actually, I think he is. Not for long. Uh, Fishlegs, where were you this afternoon? You missed hand-to-face combat. My hand to your face. I prefer to use the part of my body above the neck. What neck? Oh, amusing. But I refuse to encourage your violent tendencies, Snotlout. Don't knock it till you try it. He's glowing again. I know. Spooky. It's not me that's glowing. It's this. All : Wow. What is it? It's a stone of Good fortune. All : Ooh. My great uncle's wife's brother once told me of its powers. I thought he was mute. Until he found the stone. Then we couldn't shut him up. This stone brings good luck to whomever comes in contact with it. "Stone of Good fortune"... huh. [all clamoring] That's enough. Everyone, stand back. All : Ooh. Who found this? Uh, right here, Chief. It's a stone of Good fortune. We want to rub the stone. Let me have it. Come on, now. Please, my baby... Aah! That's a baby? I thought it was a bundle of sticks wrapped in bacon. Never mind, Tuffnut. Three yaks for the stone. Four chickens. 20 sheep, and my firstborn, Gustav. Me? Huh? Listen to me! This belongs to Fishlegs, and what he does with it is up to him. I'll give you ten yaks. Four chickens. Three chickens. Maybe we should get you out of here. 20 sheep and Gustav Larsen? You're turning that down? Come on, what do you want for it? You can't have it, Snotlout, not for any price. Oh, I think I can. You seem to forget... when Snotlout wants something, he just takes it. How badly do you really want it, Snotlout? [scoffs] You're lucky I don't hit girls. Yeah, so are you. Okay. Take it, it is. You sure you want to do this, Fishlegs? There's too much stress. You saw that mob. They ran right over me. Like a sack of flour. I just want to put this thing back where I found it and never think about it again. Stone of Good fortune... yeah, right. Whoa, girl. Where are you going? [dragon roars] They sense something. Hey, I thought you said you found it buried in the sand. I did. Then what's that? Are those... Dragon nests. Okay, why would a dragon fill its nest with gems? Because they're not gems. They're dragon eggs. How did I miss that? The egg I dug up must have fallen out and gotten buried. I can't believe I almost kept this baby away from its mother. But you didn't. Now let's put this egg back and get out of here. [Toothless snarls] The mothers must be close. Yeah, really close. Fishlegs, say good-bye, and let's go! Okay, okay, okay. Good-bye, little color-changing dragon egg. They're following us. Yeah, but what are they? I don't see anything back there. Whoa! Whatever it is, it's shooting some kind of acid at us. Invisible, acid-shooting dragons? Great. We have to get out of these trees. Like I said, if I want it, I take it. [chuckles] Suckers. "...sprays hot, burning acid". Here it is. It's called the Changewing, according to the Book of Dragons. Where are the drawings? There are none. I guess you can't really draw it if you can't see it. Listen to what it says. "This remarkable dragon is able to change the color of its skin to blend in with its surroundings." Does it say anything about eggs? N-no. Those didn't look like dragon eggs, right? If I had seen that, you know I would never have gone and stolen... Fishlegs, calm down. None of us knew. But I should have! I should have known. All I know is, it's a good thing we brought that egg back to its mother. Who knows what they'd do if the eggs were still on Berk? Uh, what's that? Uh, I don't know... maybe a lifetime of good luck. [humming] I'll take that. Over my cold, dead body. Where did you get it? We traded for it. Traded with who? All right, all right, all right, all right, all right. Everybody settle down. Settle down. I got six yaks and three chickens from the woman with the hook arm. Do I hear seven and four? I hear seven and four! Seven and four, Gustav, from the guy with the bucket on his head. Oh, and he's throwing in a matching set of battle axes. How cool. Cool. Seven and four, plus the axes. Come on, folks, only one left. Good luck for the rest of your life. Going once, twice... and sold. Gustav, give Bucket his stone of Good fortune. [squealing happily] Well, that is it, folks.  I only had three stones, and I'm all sold out, so it's time for me to pack up. All : Oh, no. Hello? Go away. It's over! 
 
 [crowd chattering dejectedly] Snotlout, what are you doing? What does it look like I'm doing? I'm getting rich. But you can't. I already did. The gems are gone. Gone. They're not gems. And they certainly don't bring good luck. Puh-lease. They're bringing me good luck. I'm up to my neck in weapons and livestock. Snotlout, those are dragon eggs. Uh, Changewings, to be exact. Changewings, schmange... I don't care what they are! All I know is I'm rich, and you're not. We're rich, and you're not. Snotlout, listen to me. We need to get those eggs off of Berk before something really bad happens. Uh, you do not want to separate a dragon mother from her egg, especially one you can't see that shoots burning acid. Really? You did. So? That was an accident. Accident, on purpose, rich, poor... Who cares? They're gone, and I have a no-return policy. Tell 'em, Gustav. No returns. [scoffs] If you want them, you'll have to take it up with my customers. Oh, it's all my fault. It's not your fault, Fishlegs. Yes, it is. If I hadn't gone to that island and brought that egg back, then Snotlout wouldn't have known where to go get them, and we wouldn't be in danger of imminent attack by angry mother Changewings. When you put it that way, it really is his fault. Just saying. Look, it doesn't matter whose fault it is. We just have to find those eggs. Okay, when I count to three, shove me really hard into the pit. Uh, are you sure? You remember what one of those things did to you? Oh, please. I'm holding the stone of Good fortune. Those skin-melting fireworms won't stand a chance against me. Okay. Thank you, Thor. Aah! Hey, what are you doing? Saving your skin... literally. Guys, that's not a good-luck stone. It's a dragon egg. And its mother is a dangerous dragon that blends in with just about anything and spits hot, burning acid and destroys whatever is in its path. Okay, so, like, if a tree, for example, were spitting acid and melting everything in sight... You're saying that would be one of these dragons? Wow, they got it on the first try. We're not stupid. At least I'm not. And besides, there's one right there. Whoa. A Changewing. It's amazing. It really does blend in. Hiccup, quick... train it so we can keep it and have it spit acid at Ruffnut. [dragon roars] Ah! Nice try, but as you can see, I am holding the stone... Ow! Ah! Aah! Did you see that? At least they're gone. Uh, they're not gone. How do you know? Because the Changewings worked as a team to save that one egg. Wait. Are you saying what I think you're saying? Oh, that's what he's saying! Wait. What are you saying? None of the Changewings are going to leave until all their eggs are safe. And they are going to tear apart Berk until they find every last one. So what you're telling me is that our village is about to be under siege by wild dragons we can't see. Oh, don't forget the hot, burning acid. What? It was awesome. Well, grab your dragons, then. We'll fight them off. Dad, I wish it were that easy. No matter what we do, they won't go away until they get what they want. They just want their babies. Oh, it's all my fault. Stoick, I just realized something. It's not a stone of Good fortune. It's a Changewing egg! I always get those two confused. So, what are you all up to? Hiccup, what are you suggesting we do? I think we should get everyone off the island until we can get the eggs back with their mothers and the Changewings are gone. Hopefully, it's not too late. In all the years I've been Chief, we've never turned in fear of anything. I'm not about to start. [crowd screaming] They're looking for their eggs. [dragon roars] Aah! [grunts] Where did it go? That would be the "blending in, can't see it at all" part. I see it. Hey, I got this, Chief. Stay, dragon. I am now your master. It's gone, isn't it? Oh, long gone. [man screaming in the distance] You and the others find those eggs. We'll handle the Changewings. Come on. They're everywhere, and they're nowhere! You have to do something, Stoick. [both yelling] [dragon roars] [crowd yelling] Hiccup was right. It's hard to fight what we can't see, Stoick. To the docks! Everyone board the ships! We're evacuating the island! [humming] [man shouting] [dragon roars] Somebody help me! Aah! Your egg, Bucket! It wants your egg! What egg? Aah! Aah! I need your stone, Mrs. Larsen. But my boy... Gustav. Snotlout said "no returns". We'll get Gustav back. Where it is? [baby crying] Aah! My baby! We got it. We got it. [dragon roars] Aw, Meatlug. Look at the baby. Baby? Ugh. Wow. Maybe Tuffnut was right. [crowd clamoring] If you don't calm down, I'll... take you by the scruffs of your necks and... Not helping, Gobber. There's no reason to panic, people. Dad, stop the evacuation. We got them all. The Changewings are gone. Then how do you explain that? There are four of them. But there were only three eggs. They're going for the ship. What do they want with... It's not the ship. It's what's on it... another egg. Can you guys keep the Changewings at bay? What are you going to do? Something I should have done a long time ago. Dad? Got it. Going somewhere, Snotlout? Who's asking? Who's asking? Go find your mother, Gustav. I can't believe you. I was really starting to like that kid. Give it to me, Snotlout. Finally. You know what I mean. Where's the egg? None of your business. Oh, what are you going to do, Fishlegs? Aah! [grunting] Now, you listen. You can do whatever you want to me. You can threaten me, make fun of me, mock my incredible dragon knowledge, but what you will not do... is stand between a baby dragon and his mother. Do you understand me, Snotlout? It's always the quiet ones that snap the loudest. I'd give it to him, Snotlout. There's no telling what he's capable of. That's it. Find it, girl. Hmm, what do you know? There it is. I think I'll just take that. Any objections? Didn't think so. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have a date with destiny. Okay, Changewings, I know you're out there. Come and get me. [dragon growls quietly] Ahh. And we're all here. Hi, I'm Fishlegs. I've read a lot about you... clearly not enough. [dragon roars] Okay, here's how this is going to work. I'm going to give you this egg, and you're going to take it. And you're going to leave Berk in peace. I promise you, if you don't burn me with that hot acid, I will spend the rest of my life making sure no one ever tries to take your eggs again. Sound good? Well, I guess that's that. I'm telling you, up close, face-to-face, it was much more ferocious. I'm just saying, one of us was there and one of us wasn't. That's it. Now do the teeth and the hot, dripping acid. Perfect. You know, Fishlegs... I do, Hiccup. We need to find one so we can study it. No. So we can train it. Snotlout, Fishlegs, you're up. Excuse me. There's something I've been meaning to take care of. Having courage isn't the same as having no fear. It's being afraid and pushing forward anyway, whether that means saving a baby dragon, protecting those you love, or giving a special someone the butt kicking they so richly deserve. Both : Aah!
