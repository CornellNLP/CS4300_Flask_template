 [dragon growls] 
 Let's go, bud. 
 [dragon roars] 
 Yeah. 
 Wow. 
 Wow. 
 Whoa, nice. 
 That was pretty good. 
 Living with dragons has its ups and its downs. 
 [wood snaps] 
 [wood creaks] 
 You need to stay calm, [screaming] 
 Keep a clear head. 
 Not always easy with vikings. 
 More supports? 
 Eh, well, they are dragons. 
 In our own way, we're very reasonable. 
 It's okay, girl. Just take it easy. 
 [happy roar] 
 [cheering] 
 Way to go! 
 So we built these things so stuff wouldn't break? 
 I don't understand you people. 
 And they tricked us into helping them build them. 
 I feel so used. 
 And sweaty. 
 But when a problem is caused By something vikings don't understand, They lose all sense of reason. 
 And that can become very dangerous. 
 [glasses clink] 
 Perches for dragons. 
 Some of your best work, men. 
 [sighs] 
 Although we may need to move the one over the well. 
 And the perches are just the beginning. 
 We could build landing areas for them. 
 Maybe even stables in the caves underneath the village and-- 
 Easy, son. 
 Remember, berk is still for people. 
 Vikings before dragons. 
 [curious grunt] 
 Yeah, I said it. 
 Deal with it. 
 [thunder rumbles] 
 The lightning is hitting everywhere. 
 It doesn't usually strike here in the village. 
 Thor must be angry. 
 The only other time I can remember Lightning ever striking berk... 
 Both : Barnstadt. 
 Barn who? 
 Jurgen barnstadt. 
 Drifter. Sailed into town. 
 He was stealing from widows and old men. 
 To punish him, thor gave him a lightning bolt Right through his helmet When he fixing the mast on his ship to make his escape. 
 [chuckles] 
 By the time thor was finished with him, Our whole fleet was on fire. 
 We shipped him off the island And thor hasn't hit the village since. 
 Threw him off the island? 
 Pretty harsh. 
 [scattered screams] 
 Gobber. 
 [screeches] 
 Gobber, organize a bucket brigade. 
 I'm going up to the great hall. 
 [frightened roar] 
 Toothless! 
 I gotta find Toothless. 
 Yeah, now that's what I'm talking about. 
 I've always liked thor. 
 Ugh, I love these storms. 
 When it rains, I cancel bath night And just stand outside with nothing but a sponge And a bar of soap. 
 We know. The village has had meetings about it. 
 I need your help. I need to find Toothless. 
 I just saw him by the great hall. 
 Don't worry, men. 
 You're gonna be all right. 
 It's striking throughout the entire village. 
 It's like we're under siege. 
 [thunder rumbles] 
 I've never seen thor this angry. 
 Toothless! 
 Did you all see that? 
 Yes. 
 Ooh! 
 [awed mumbling] 
 [lightning cracks] 
 [frightened roar] 
 [frightened roar] 
 Look, the lightning is following him. 
 Toothless. 
 [coos] 
 Don't you all understand? 
 Thor is mad at all of us. 
 And I'll tell you why. 
 Because of him! 
 As you all know, the night fury Is the unholy offspring of lightning and death itself. 
 We've let him live among us And now we will all pay the price. 
 Well, it did seem as though The lightning struck right at the dragon. 
 Yes, right at the dragon! 
 And a lightning storm The likes of which we've never had. 
 There is but one thing for us to do. 
 Banish the night fury! 
 It's the only way. 
 [murmured agreement] 
 [lightning cracks] 
 Thor is angry at us because of the night fury. 
 You all saw it. 
 [murmured agreement] 
 What? No! This is ridiculous. 
 If we don't act now, Well, need I remind you of...Barnstadt? 
 [worried murmurs] 
 Barnstadt? Oh, no. 
 You're right, all of you. Thor is angry. 
 But I don't believe he's angry at Toothless. 
 That's right. 
 Have you all forgotten What Toothless has done for this village? 
 Well then, who do you suppose he's angry at? 
 I don't presume to know thor's mind, Mildew. 
 But we will find a way to soothe his anger. 
 [lightning cracks] 
 Another storm is coming. 
 [grumbles] 
 Thor tore a hole in the great hall. 
 Maybe he's hungry. I know I am. 
 We need to make thor happy. 
 But what do you get the god of thunder and lightning? 
 In the past, I know thor's enjoyed a sacrifice or two. 
 Let's sacrifice Tuffnut. 
 Okay. What time should I be there? 
 There better be fire involved. 
 Nobody's gonna be sacrificed. 
 Not yet anyway. 
 I had an aunt who was cursed by odin once. 
 She had to pay tribute to him by sailing to the end of the earth. 
 Did it work? 
 I don't know. I guess she couldn't find it Because she kept showing up from the opposite direction. 
 The gods have never been mad at anyone from our family. 
 Knock on wood. 
 Hop on one foot. 
 Slap a jorgensen. 
 [giggles] 
 If I were thor, I would want a giant statue... [growls] of myself. 
 Snotlout as thor. 
 You do know we're trying to make him happy? 
 Exactly. Mwah. Mwah. 
 [retches] Ugh. 
 I think I just threw up in my mouth. 
 Actually that's not a bad idea. 
 It's not an idea. It's a reflex. 
 N--what? No. I-I mean the statue. 
 [retches] There I go again. 
 No, not Snotlout. 
 Mwah. 
 Thor. 
 Hmm. 
 Berk has never given thor a statue. 
 Well, then it's high time we did. 
 [metal clanging] 
 Ouch! 
 [giggles] 
 Ow! 
 Great job. 
 Uh, one issue. 
 Thor's knee bends the other way. 
 You know, like a knee... On a person. 
 Hmm. 
 What are you doing? 
 I'm making thor's pants. 
 I hope they're not too tight. 
 I hate it when my pants are too tight. 
 I feel so bloated. 
 Okay, guys, we better start welding these pieces together. 
 Hmm. Yeah. 
 I really think thor's gonna like this. 
 [crowd chatters] 
 Attention. Attention everyone. 
 Okay, so I know we're not exactly Thor's favorite people right now, But I am confident that this beautiful statue Will go a long way toward Getting us back in his good graces. 
 So, without further ado... 
 [crowd oohs and ahs] 
 Well done! 
 Thor will appreciate this tribute And will smile upon us once again. 
 [cheers and applause] 
 You really think this is enough To appease the mighty thor While you allow a night fury in your midst? 
 You're fools! All of you! 
 [lightning cracks] 
 Unbelievable. 
 Even more lightning than the last storm. 
 I don't understand. 
 We gave thor a giant statue. 
 It was a gallant effort, son. 
 But it looks as though this is not what thor wanted. 
 Gobber, what are you doing? 
 Uh, I love Toothless. 
 I'm just erring on the side of caution. 
 [snorts] 
 Hey, don't worry, bud. 
 I'm not gonna let anything happen to you... 
 No matter what some people think. 
 
 
 
 [thunder rumbles] 
 Sniffs [yelps] 
 I know you're scared, girl. 
 If you wanna hold me, that's what I'm here for. 
 Whoa. 
 Look at all that damage and destruction. 
 [shell cracks] 
 [crunches] 
 I know, it's so beautiful. 
 Whoa, whoa, whoa. 
 Whoa. 
 Nobody blows stuff up like thor. 
 [shell cracks] 
 [chomps] 
 [panicked chattering] 
 [shocked gasps and shouting] 
 That's what thor thinks of the statue. 
 I told you what he wants and we haven't given it to him. 
 Until we rid this island of that night fury, Thor's fire will continue to rain down upon us. 
 You don't really think thor is angry Because of Toothless, do you? 
 Of course I don't. 
 [banging on door] 
 Open up, Stoick. 
 We've come for the night fury! 
 But I'm afraid they do. 
 [coos] 
 Get Toothless to a safe place. 
 I'll try to reason with them. 
 But-- 
 Just go. 
 [continued banging] 
 Safe travels, old friend. 
 [crowd chatters angrily] 
 Don't worry, bud. 
 It's you and me. 
 [grunts] 
 Give up the dragon, Stoick! 
 Look at your people. 
 We've had enough. 
 You're too late. 
 He's gone. 
 Stoick's already sent him off the island. 
 Thor says otherwise. 
 The dragon must still be on the island. 
 Find the night fury! 
 Go! 
 We can hide Toothless in the cove for now. 
 They'll just find him. 
 No. We have to leave. 
 We? 
 He can't make it on his own. 
 And I wouldn't want him to. 
 I'm going with him, Astrid. 
 But you'll come back, right? 
 Yeah. Eventually. 
 When they all realize This didn't happen because of Toothless. 
 [angry murmurs approach] 
 You better go. 
 [thunder crashes] 
 Where's the boy? 
 And more importantly, where's the dragon? 
 I don't know, Mildew. 
 But you got your wish. 
 Hiccup and Toothless are gone. 
 Oh, bah! 
 Find the night fury! 
 All of you. 
 [screeches] 
 [screams] 
 Toothless! 
 Ah, there they are! 
 [grunts and groans] 
 Whew. You okay, bud? 
 [rumbling] 
 Hmm. 
 [metal sizzles] 
 Ow. 
 That's where the lightning hit. 
 [thunder crashing] 
 [electricity buzzing] 
 Metal. 
 I wonder... 
 [snarls] 
 Secure the dragon! 
 Toothless! [grunts] 
 No! Leave him alone! 
 Don't try and stop us. 
 You'll only make it worse for your precious dragon. 
 [growling] 
 Toothless! 
 Say your good-bye. 
 Toothless! 
 [groans] 
 Toothless... 
 [whines] 
 [thunder crashing] 
 I know you're afraid. 
 But this isn't how we do things on berk. 
 These dragons are not the beasts we once thought they were. 
 They're part of us now. 
 Not this one! Not anymore. 
 Release the dragon, Mildew. 
 Open your eyes, Stoick. 
 It's the only solution and you know it. 
 It worked with barnstadt and it'll work with Toothless. 
 [thunder crashing] 
 Hiccup, they've got Toothless. 
 They're about to float him out to sea. 
 I know. Why do you think I have this? 
 Ooh, tough one. 
 How many guesses do we get? Five? 
 Okay... Astrid, fly me to the docks. 
 If you want to get to that dragon, You're gonna have to go through us. 
 Thank you, lads. 
 If we're choosing sides, Mulch, Uh, there's more over there. Lots more. 
 We stand with the chief, bucket! 
 Stop. 
 Stop! 
 You could get rid of Toothless. 
 You could throw him off the edge of the world, But it's not going to stop this lightning From destroying berk. 
 What's he talking about? 
 [overlapping chatter] 
 It's the metal. 
 [thunder crashing] 
 The lightning is hitting the metal. 
 Just think about it. 
 We never had a lightning storm like this Until we put up those perches. 
 And that statue, right? 
 And they're all made of metal. 
 Oh, bah! You ever heard of anything so insane? 
 Well, that's ridiculous! 
 [crowd grumbling] 
 You see, this is where the lightning struck Toothless,  On this connecting rod-- this metal connecting rod. 
 [indistinct chatter] 
 Well, if--if you don't believe me, I can prove it. 
 Fly me up. 
 Are you sure you know what you're doing? 
 "sure"? Uh... That's a strong word. 
 It's really more of a hunch. 
 I'll be fine. Go. 
 Oh, boy. Here he goes again. 
 He doesn't make it easy. Hiccup! 
 You'll all see for yourselves. 
 When I attach this metal rod to the top of this mast, The lightning will be drawn to it-- 
 Hiccup! 
 Son... 
 [water splashing] 
 [roars] 
 Hiccup... 
 [rumbles] 
 [grunts] 
 Son... 
 [groaning] 
 Toothless! What happened, bud? 
 At least I didn't lose another one. 
 [footsteps approaching] 
 My boy! 
 You're alright. 
 You took a lightning bolt to the head. 
 Just like barnstadt, Except we won't be throwing you off the island. 
 So everyone knows thor wasn't mad at Toothless? 
 They do now. 
 Until we figure out why thor was angry at the metal, We're all walking on eggshells. 
 [metal clattering] 
 We worked so hard on that statue. 
 Kind of a shame to just scrap it for parts. 
 Well, maybe we don't have to. 
 Why don't you take it to one of the high points on the island And leave it there? 
 Good idea, chief. 
 Would have thought of it myself, but I'm not the chief. 
 Oh, we'll handle that for you. 
 [crashing outside] 
 [grumbling] 
 Eh--what? 
 [grumbling] 
 You'll pay for this! 
 [sheep bleating] 
 I'm not sure that's what my dad had in mind, guys. 
 Hey, that's the way I understood it. 
 [laughter] 
 [knock at door] 
 No matter how much things change around here, Vikings are still vikings. 
 They're not afraid to admit when they're wrong. 
 And when they do, watch out, 'cause you'll be up to your ears in pie and smoked fish. 
 [growling happily] 
 [screams]
