 Let's go, bud. 
 Wow... Ooh... Nice... 
 Everybody needs a place in the world. 
 Some people are born to theirs. 
 Raise the main sail! 
 Aye! 
 Turn her toward starboard! 
 Aye, aye, sir! 
 Some people discover theirs. 
 And some people make a place for themselves... 
 Grab a weapon! 
 No time to be choosy! 
 But then the world around them changes, and the place they made is gone. 
 Every dragon has his own unique abilities that give it its special place in the world. 
 Which dragon makes the best welding torch? 
 Oh, Deadly Nadder. 
 Its magnesium flame burns with the heat of the sun. 
 Correct. Point to Team Astrid. 
 Score is now 100 to 10. 
 And you started with 10. 
 Oh, yeah? Well, the game's not over. 
 Wait, what team am I on? 
 Next question. 
 What is the shot limit of a hideous zippleback, Team Snotlout? 
 I don't think they can count that high. 
 Oh, really? Let's find out. 
 Barf, belch... 
 Heh. Looks like it's about three. 
 Told you we could count that high. 
 It's six. You were half-right. Five points. 
 Yes! We're up to 30. 
 All right, it's our turn. 
 What happens when you shoot fire at the owner of a deadly nadder? 
 No fair. She didn't give us time to answer. 
 I've got a question. 
 What happens when I sic Hookfang on you? 
 Okay, guys, that's enough training. 
 So we did some really good work here today. 
 Prepare to face the monstrous nightmare! 
 Aww... that's the third time this week! 
 Uuhhhh... Sweet relief... 
 Hookfang never flames up when you're riding him. 
 Is he okay? 
 Maybe he just realized who his owner is. 
 There's room in here for two. 
 Gather around. Come on, one and all. 
 You may think these dragon-killing weapons have no more use, but think again. 
 This longsword is now a lovely butter knife. 
 Eh... 
 It's also great for making bread crumbs. 
 Moving on. 
 Well, this is a dark day. 
 A great dragon slayer peddling his weapons as kitchen utensils. 
 Up next, how about this-uh... 
 Handy fly swatter. 
 Uh-ha... also good for getting rid of unwanted tables. 
 Now, for the lady of the house. 
 When the hubby's off pillaging, how are you going to protect yourself from home invaders? 
 No problem when you have Big Bertha. 
 Wait. There's more. Come back. 
 You haven't seen everything yet! 
 I haven't cleared out my dungeon yet! 
 That's okay, Bertha. We'll find a place for ya. 
 Oh, it's hard to watch. 
 Especially for you, eh, Hiccup? 
 The feelings of guilt must be tearing at your insides. 
 I mean, you put him out of business with your little peace pact with the dragons. 
 You ruined his life. Bravo. 
 You know Gobber made this for me? 
 He taught me everything I needed to know to make your tail. 
 I've got to find some way to help him. 
 Tough day of chiefing, Dad? 
 I was all over the island. 
 I married the Svensson girl to the Odegaard boy at dawn, then down to the fields where some kids were tipping over yaks, then back up to the newlyweds to settle a domestic dispute. 
 I guess that honeymoon is over. 
 Sometimes I wish there were two of me. 
 That... there... there are two of you! 
 Is that another crack about my weight? 
 No, I mean Gobber. He can be the other you. 
 Gobber? 
 Oh, he's way too busy making all those dragon-killing... 
 Eh, well, used to be, until you... 
 Which is great, except for Gobber. 
 Exactly my point. 
 You know, that's actually not such a bad idea. 
 I could use a right hand. 
 Which works out great, 'cause that's kinda the only one he has. 
 I greatly appreciate you helping me out, Gobber. 
 I'm just glad I could find time in my busy schedule, Stoick. 
 I've got a full day ahead of me. Here's your half. 
 Oh, this'll be interesting. 
 Now remember, some of these situations are delicate. 
 They require diplomacy. 
 Oh, no problem. I'm great at... 
 That. 
 Really? You? 
 Y- you can speak to people with tact and sensitivity? 
 Oh, I thought it meant clubbing people on the head and asking questions later, but I can give your thing a shot. 
 Whosoever brings this child forth into the Hooligan tribe, let he be known. 
 As a representative of the chief, I welcome this baby into the Hooligan tribe, and pronounce the name to be... 
 Yech... Hildegard? 
 Doesn't seem like a Hildegard to me. 
 Let's go with Magnus. 
 But she's a girl, Gobber. 
 Don't worry. She's not gonna look like one. 
 Magnus it is. 
 And please accept this teething toy on behalf of Stoick the Vast. 
 No! 
 Bucket says you never paid him for the sheep. 
 I never bought a sheep. 
 Who's that? 
 The little woman? 
 Oh, Mulch. You're cheating me now? 
 Clearly, there's only one way to settle this. 
 Diplomacy, check. 
 All right, what's next? 
 I know the conventional thinking when repairing a ship is wood, but if you ask me, there's nothing like a good, old slab of iron. 
 Nothing's getting through this. 
 Gobber! What do you think you're doing? 
 Just checking another item off the list. 
 And adding an item for later. 
 "Recover sunken ship." 
 Same time tomorrow? 
 Here you go, Dad. 
 Wow, a two-block headache. 
 You know, Dad, I think you're being a wee bit rough on Gobber. 
 It was his first day. 
 Tomorrow'll be way better. 
 Oh, it will be for me because it won't involve Gobber. 
 What do you mean? 
 I tried to fit a square peg in a round hole, and it sunk a ship and named a baby girl "Magnus." 
 Now, I'm not saying she didn't look like a Magnus, but try telling that to her parents. 
 I can't believe you let him go. 
 Well, we've got to help him. 
 "We" don't have to do anything. 
 You, on the other hand, are going to be very busy finding a job for Gobber. 
 You're bringing Gobber here? 
 He's gonna be great. 
 Nobody knows dragons like old Gobber. 
 He has spent a lifetime, you know, studying them. 
 If we can tap into that, we'll all be better dragon trainers. 
 I'm back! Did ya miss me? 
 First of all, uh, welcome. 
 Uh, and second, uh, tiny question. 
 Why, uh, did you bring your, you know... 
 Killing things? 
 I thought maybe we could train them... 
 By threatening to kill them. 
 That's how my daddy taught me to swim. 
 School's in session! 
 Eh, I didn't like school either. 
 What's wrong with you guys? 
 Ugh, we've been riding our dragons for four hours. 
 It took forever to chase them down after Gobber scared them away. 
 Yeah, I'm sorry about that. 
 I just don't know what to do with him. 
 Do you guys always have to fight? 
 It's okay, I asked her to do that. 
 I was just trying to get the feeling back. 
 You gonna return the favor, or what? 
 I've flown for hours on Toothless, and I've never had a problem. 
 That's because you have a saddle. 
 Saddles! 
 Saddles? I love it! 
 I've got so many ideas. 
 But not like these. Good ones. 
 I'm glad you're excited, but I still think there are some things in my designs you could use. 
 I mean, you did teach me everything I know. 
 Exactly. 
 That's why you should let Gobber do what Gobber does best. 
 I've been making saddles since you were in diapers. 
 In fact, I made your diapers. 
 I know you know what you're doing, but keep in mind, every dragon is different. 
 So, you need to adjust the- 
 Hiccup. 
 But- 
 Hiccup. 
 But I just think- 
 Hiccup. 
 I may have taught you everything you know, but I haven't taught you everything I know. 
 
 
 
 ♪ I've got my axe, and I've got my mace ♪ 
♪ and I love my wife with the ugly face ♪ 
♪ I'm a Viking through and through ♪ 
 You know, he doesn't sing that song unless he's actually very happy. 
 I think we did a good thing. 
 All right, this is an exciting day for all of us. 
 Gobber has been working hard to... 
 I think they might want to hear from the artist himself. 
 I've made a lot of saddles in my day. 
 Horse, donkey, and now dragon. 
 But these saddles are special. 
 They're like my children. 
 That is, if you strapped your child to a flaming reptile and rode it. 
 So without further ado... 
 Uh, wow, Gobber... 
 This-this is certainly not what I imagined. 
 How could it be? I'm Gobber. 
 Nobody knows what it's like to live in here. 
 But is that- 
 Yep. 
 Flamethrower. 
 Didn't see that one coming, did ya? 
 Uh, no. No, not- Not for dragons. 
 They come with one built in, actually. 
 I know, but can you ever really have too much firepower? 
 Uh, catapults for the twins? 
 Not such a good idea. 
 You can do it, girl. Think light. 
 Oh, come on. 
 You can't tell me my saddle is heavier than fishlegs. 
 My mom says i'm just husky. 
 Come on, Hookfang. What's wrong with you? 
 That's it. Someone's trading with me. 
 Yeah, sure. 
 I'll trade my perfect dragon for an angry oven. 
 This saddle's actually pretty good. 
 Wait till you try the horn. 
 Really? Again? 
 So anyway, I... I think we're really gonna need to make a few... 
 Changes. I'm way ahead of you. 
 I've got so many ideas. 
 It's getting crowded up here. 
 My Odin. 
 This place looked better when we were killing dragons here. 
 Yeah, we sort of got "Gobbered". 
 Well, you know Gobber. He means well. 
 He just doesn't always do well. 
 So what are you gonna do about him? 
 I'm gonna clean up his messes and redo his work. 
 Look, Gobber's like family. 
 Yeah, I know he is. 
 That's why I can't say anything to him. 
 No, son, that's why you have to. 
 It's not fair to you, and it's not fair to Gobber. 
 Why do I have to say something to him? 
 You didn't. You just passed him off to me. 
 That's what the chief does. He delegates. 
 Look, I gave you this academy because it's the best thing for Berk. 
 Now, you have to do what's best for the academy. 
 And I'm sorry, son, but what's best is very rarely what's easy. 
 What about him? 
 Leave him. He's going for a record. 
 Enough said. 
 Hey, you never know, bud. 
 Maybe Gobber finally looked at my plans and is actually making the saddles better. 
 Or not. 
 Gobber? 
 Don't shoot! 
 I would never shoot you, Hiccup. 
 Unless I absolutely had to. 
 Uuh... uuh... uhh... yeah. 
 Still, if you could please put the crossbow down, I know I'd feel better. 
 You know, about the weapons... 
 Maybe the catapults were a bit much for some of the dragons yesterday. 
 So I've gone a different way. 
 I've gotten rid of the two big ones. 
 Gobber, that's great. 
 And replaced them with six little ones! 
 Yeah, um... 
 Gobber, we need to talk. 
 Uh, I think it might be time for you to take a little break. 
 In case you hadn't noticed, the only time a viking takes a break is to die. 
 Maybe "break" is the wrong word. 
 What I mean is I'm not sure things are working out. 
 Well, get back to me when you're sure. 
 Okay, I'm sure. 
 Gobber, I'm gonna need to take you off the saddle project. 
 Are you getting rid of me, Hiccup? 
 Now I see why you had me put down the crossbow. 
 That was just the saddles. 
 We'll find something else for ya. 
 I don't need your pity. 
 I've lost an arm and a leg. 
 I think I'll survive losing a job. 
 I'm really sorry, Gobber. 
 Well, that was awful. 
 I don't know what could be worse than that. 
 Okay, looks like I'm about to find out. 
 I never... thought... I'd say this... 
 But, Hiccup... 
 Help! 
 Everybody, back away! 
 The dragon's out of control, it's not safe here! 
 I don't know what happened. I was just rubbing his head. 
 He usually loves that, but this time, he went crazy. 
 My dragon hates me. 
 They do say a pet starts to take on the characteristics of its owner. 
 I think that's what's happening here. 
 Yeah, I rest my case. 
 When was the last time he ate? 
 Not for days. 
 You hungry, boy? 
 Oh, sorry, Dad. 
 We've got to bring this dragon under control. 
 Don't worry, I can do this. 
 There you go. 
 It's gonna be okay. 
 Hiccup, run! 
 Way ahead of you! 
 Toothless! 
 Stop! 
 I've seen enough, Hiccup. 
 I'm sorry. We tried it your way. 
 Gobber, we need you! 
 No, you don't. 
 Nobody needs me. 
 Nobody needs any of us. 
 Not even you, Bertha. 
 Are... are you crying? 
 Of course not. I'm just chopping onions. 
 There are no onions. 
 Not anymore. Look what I used to chop them with. 
 There's a dragon in the plaza that's out of control. 
 Then why don't you call Hiccup? 
 No, Gobber. We need you. 
 Come on, guys, hurry up, think. 
 What haven't we tried? 
 Snotlout, you have an idea? 
 Gobber. 
 Stand back. 
 I came here to do what I do best. 
 He's gonna kill my dragon. 
 No, he's not. 
 Uh, yeah, he is. 
 You don't use that stuff to butter toast. 
 Well, I mean, we would, but you don't. 
 Dad, you can't be serious. Hookfang is Snotlout's dragon. 
 I'm sorry, Hiccup. 
 But sometimes you have to fall back on the old ways. 
 But he's a good dragon. 
 He's a good dragon. 
 There's probably just something wrong with him. 
 There's definitely something wrong with him. 
 We have to try to help him. 
 We can't just get rid of him because he's having a bad day. 
 A bad day for a dragon can be a disaster for us. 
 That's not a risk I'm willing to take. 
 Gobber. 
 Ha. You're all out of fire. 
 I can't let you do this. 
 There's no choice. It has to be done. 
 Do you see that? 
 I do. 
 Time to put this beast out of its misery. 
 Hiccup, what are you doing? 
 Oh, you didn't kill him! 
 For a toothache? 
 What kind of lunatic are you? 
 Stop it. Stop it. 
 Ugh, I don't know where that came from. 
 Can you train that out of him, or... 
 Thank you, Gobber. 
 A bad tooth. I can't believe I didn't think of that. 
 That's because you're not Gobber. 
 I've forgotten more about dragons than most men will ever know. 
 Well, better go put the girls away. 
 Gobber! Not so fast. 
 When the world around you changes, the good men find a way to change with it, and Gobber is one of those good men. 
 In fact, he's one of the best.
