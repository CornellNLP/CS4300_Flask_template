 1x11 - Heather Report, part 2 
 Let's go, bud. 
 [Toothless roars] 
 [heroic music] 
 Yeah. 
 Wow. 
 Cool. 
 Wow. 
 Wow, nice. 
 He's pretty good. 
 [i]Previously on Dragons... You will not believe what I just found! Astrid is jealous of the pretty one. Everything's going to be okay. Consider Berk your home. I don't think we should be showing her all our dragon secrets. Astrid, it's fine. Got ya. What have you learned about the dragons? They have a book. It's got everything Alvin could ever hope to learn about controlling dragons. You're not thinking clearly. Oh, really? Me? The Outcasts could be attacking any minute! Alvin has the Book of Dragons. [panting] [grunting] [branches rustling] [continues grunting] You can break out of jail as many times as you want, but you're not getting off this island. [gasps] [grunts] Give it up, Heather. We have dragons. Astrid, I have to get back to outcast island. Yeah, I bet you do. You don't understand. Alvin has my parents! [chuckles] Oh, yeah? Well, what happened to the pirates? [sighs] There were never any pirates. I made it up. But I had to. I needed you to trust me. Well, guess what. We don't, not anymore. Uh, is that the book? Looks like. The only question is... [growling] ...how are we going to get to it? Uh, if we had the dragon book, maybe it would tell us what to do. You mean that book? Ah. Right. Look, the husky, smart kid on Berk rides one of these dragons... they're very gentle. [purrs] So go take it from him. What are you waiting for? It's just one little dragon. Go! Uh, hello, there, uh, dragon. Um, if you wouldn't mind, I'd, uh, just like to borrow your book. [growls] [whimpering] [screaming] Oh. Well, that didn't work. Who's next? [grumbling] Don't look at me. [whistling] [grunts] Hey! That was a little close, Snotlout! Quit whining, Fishlegs. [growls] [grunts] Hey! Cut it out! Quit whining, Snotlout. Nice job, guys. But remember, the Outcasts are not going to be coming one at a time. You don't need to remind me. We're under enough stress. Remember, we're only going to have one shot at getting the Book of Dragons back. Um, did I not make myself clear about the stress? [growls] [shrieks] Too early, Snotlout. We have to time it perfectly. It wasn't me. It was them. Uh, sorry. Yeah, still working out the kinks. [laughs] [roars] Can you calm him down? Fine. Whatever. [roars] [grunts] [purrs] Figured that one out yesterday. He likes it. Wait, wait, wait. He likes having his horns bent to the ground? Tuffnut does. I do? [grunts] Oh, yeah. That does feel kind of nice. The dirt's soft. Can we get on with it? There could be a whole army coming at us. Well... ♪ we're waiting ♪ [squawks] Hit it! Spines, Stormfly, now! [grunts] [sighs] Kind of like that too. Make a note. That's going to work great. You know, all this training is nice once we have the book. But Alvin's not just going to hand it over to us. No, but maybe Alvin will hand it to Heather. Uh, I think Astrid's been eating dragon nip again. Ow! Why is it always violence with you? It's not violence. It's communication. So you're suggesting that we let Heather go? Sort of. Yep, dragon nip. [screams] What's that on your helmet? Lava. Gronckle chapter... you might want to read it. Huh. This is all very interesting. [scoffs] I'll have to see it to believe it. Where's the girl? She was captured after she made the drop. [clicking tongue] How unfortunate for her. But, hey, let's give this a try, shall we? Um, this is... this is going to work, right? 'Cause if it doesn't work, Alvin's going to know all our dragon secrets. And if Alvin knows all our dragon secrets... Fishlegs... it'll work. Look, that must be... Heather! Get her! That rhymes! [grunts] You must stay... [grunting] In your cell. How many times do we have to tell you? [grunts] It's me, you muttonheads! Whoa. Wow! Ooh. Uh, sorry, Astrid. Totally unconvincing. Oh, yeah, I could tell. Are you sure about this? No, but it's our only chance. We'll be shadowing you from the sky. I don't need shadowing. Just in case. You know, it'll make me feel better. Fine. Just stay out of sight. If Alvin sees you, it'll all be over. Don't worry about us. Just get the book and get out of there. We'll be waiting. [grunts] Hey, Astrid... be safe. [waves lapping] Anyone in here hungry? We've got a lovely cabbage soup tonight. Yummy! Oh, not again. Stoick is going to kill me. No good, no good, no good, no good! [grunts] [groans] [grunts] Sorry, Bucket. But I have to get to Outcast island, and nothing is going to stop me. Whoa. [gasps, screams] We thought you'd been captured. I was, but I got away. Well, it's good to see you safe and sound. Get rid of her. What? We don't need you anymore. Savage, wait! You do need me. I can prove it! You have the book, right? I've watched them. I've learned from them. Trust me, that book is only worth something if you know how to use it. [hisses] Okay, never startle a sleeping Nadder. [growls] Hey, it's me, girl... your old pal Heather. You and I are going to go on a little trip. [gasps] I'm... I'm just going to put this saddle on you. [growls] Sorry, girl... no chicken tonight. [grunts] [purrs] See? No big deal. Okay. Good girl. [sighs] That wasn't so hard. Now, let's go find Astrid. [growls] [gasping] [grunts] Come on, girl! Come on, Stormfly! Yeah, come on! I want to go on record as saying I'm not so sure about this plan, Hiccup. If you have another one, I'm open. I just think landing in a wild-dragon nesting ground is really going to freak Meatlug out. [growls] Really? Well, how does she feel about flaming arrows and catapults? Uh, yeah, she really doesn't like those either. Oh, you don't say. Tell you what, Fishlegs... when we get there, you just lay back and let real dragons do the work. Yeah, you really have no idea what a swarm of angry wild dragons are capable of. You know what would be awesome? Flaming arrows, catapults... Both : And wild dragons. That makes three of you. Seems pretty straightforward to me. It's anything but straightforward, Alvin. If there's one thing I've learned, it's that people will say anything to keep themselves alive. Isn't that right, Savage? Right, as usual, Alvin. [chuckles] See? Now, you say I need you to interpret what's in this book, to use it properly. I say it's nothing but a ploy. Fine. Give it a try. You heard the girl. [dragon snarling] Uh, all right. [snarls] Seems easy enough. Uh, what kind of dragon is this? [pages rustling] It's a Deadly Nadder. You need the page number? Uh, nope, nope, nope. Right here. [growling] "Deadly Nadder... likes to preen, very sure of itself, constant grooming." Hmm, all right, we'll appeal to its vanity. Uh, well, you, uh, certainly are a lovely girl. [growls] Or are you a handsome boy? [laughs nervously] Who can tell? [growls] [grunts] [grunts] Like I said, the book can only get you so far, Alvin. You see this, Fishlegs? You got yourself all worked up for nothing. [growls] Um, you were saying? [dragons growling] Guys, remember, stick to the plan, no matter how crazy it gets. Crazy? I love crazy. Bring it! Wait. What's the plan again? [growls] 
 
 Now! Fire! Sweet! Yes! We did it! Stupid dragons. [screams] [grunting] Would you just let go of the fish? I'll catch you! No! That's my lunch! Now! [grunts] What is it? The book... I need it. Well, I didn't memorize it! [both grunt] Please be a Nadder. Please be a Nadder. Please be a Nadder. Please be a Nadder. Please be a Nadder. Please be a Nadder. [roars] Oh, great. Well? I'm waiting. All right, big boy, it's you and me. [roars] Oh! Okay, check that off the list. How about the direct approach? [grunting fiercely] Our little Heather is feistier than I remember. [grunts] This isn't anything my soldiers haven't already tried. You'll need to do better! Oh! The one time I wish Snotlout was here. Snotlout... [growls] [grunts fiercely] Well, that's the end of that. Wait. Look. [grunts] These things don't budge! [growls] [grunts] What? [laughs] I told you she knew what she was doing. Yes, you certainly did. [sighs] What do you say we get out of here? [growls gently] [men grunting] [screaming] Going somewhere, Heather? As far away from this place as possible! Without your parents? Parents? She was telling the truth? I might see my way clear to trading 'em for that book. Or you can leave, and I'll kill 'em. Cuckoo! Cuckoo! What are you doing? Cuckoo! Cuckoo! Duh! That's our signal. Guys, we don't give the signal this time. Astrid does. We talked about this. Like any of this matters anyway? She's almost an hour late. Oh, we never should have let her go. Alvin must have figured out what was going on and... Costume sucked. I told you guys. Guys, she'll be here. It's Astrid. Well, let's have it. Send them over first! Fine. Off you go. Mom! Dad! I'm a friend of Heather's. I'm here to help. You do realize I'll never let you out of here with that book? No kidding! When I tell you, drop to the ground. It's about to get really hot in here. Oh, Heather. I'm waiting. [grunts fiercely] Now. Sorry, boy. [roars] Heather, Heather, Heather. Eh? Or are you? [purrs] There's Astrid. Who's that with her? I don't know. But that's the signal. Okay, let's go, bud. We're on. Who's this? Heather's parents. She was telling the truth. Just go with the plan. [branch snaps] Oy! There they are. Get 'em! [laughs] Well, Hiccup. Bet you're surprised to see me. Eh, not really. [snarls] This is where you live, right? Hey, easy, bud. Looks like he's got us this time. You know, Hiccup, with this book, your knowledge of dragons and my knowledge of warfare, we could make quite the team. How does that sound? Uh, insane, demented, delusional, stupid. All right, then. We'll just have to agree to disagree. You're a smart boy, Hiccup. You know I can't let you leave the island. And you're a smart murderous barbarian, Alvin. You know I have a better plan than this. So do I. Now! Now! [dragons snarling] [men whining] Help! Help! This wasn't part of the plan, Hiccup. Youch! Get him! Look out! There's too many of them! Whoa, whoa, whoa. We're never going to get out of here! Is that...? Yeah! Heather! Stormfly! What? Heather? [purrs] I'm sorry I didn't believe you. It's okay. I wouldn't have believed me either. Now let's get your parents. Mom! Dad! Hang on! [growling] [both laughing] All right, guys, just like we practiced. [growls] Ruffnut, cover fire! It's about time. I love this part. Wait for it. Fishlegs, incoming! Oh, nice catch, girl. Lava blast. That's it, Meatlug! Yeah! [arrows whizzing] Now, Snotlout! [growls] Go for it! Yee-haw! You feeling the heat, boys? 'Cause I sure am. Great job, guys. Let's get out of here. They're getting away! Stop 'em! [grunts] Shouldn't we test this first? [screaming] [groans] Why, you little... Astrid! Surrender, or I'll... [chuckles] Well, you know the rest. [snarls] Do it, bud. Hiccup, don't shoot! [gulps] Who is that? Just a new friend I made. Did you see that? The dragon came for her. It protected her. Bonded with her. We need to get that book back, Alvin. We need more than the book. We need that boy. [sighs] I can't thank you enough... especially you, Astrid. You put your life on the line for us, and I'll never forget that. [sighs] I'm going to miss you. [purring] [laughs] Both of you. Uh, who knows? Maybe we'll see each other again sometime. Maybe we will. Just promise me one thing... If you need help again, you'll ask. I will. I promise. Ever since dragons showed up on Berk, we've learned to expect the unexpected. [whispering] Write me. But every once in a while, something or someone comes along that surprises us. And when the happens, you kind of hate to see them go.
