 1x03 - Animal House 
 Let's go, bud. 
 Wow, nice. 
 Here on Berk, we made peace with the dragons. 
 We're finally living and working together. [dragon grunting] And it only took us 300 years. There's one slight problem... [dragons shrieking] we forgot to tell the animals. [dragon roars] [sheep bleating] [dragon roars] Oh, not again. You go on now, you get. Get, shoo. You know you're not supposed to be in here. [dragon roars] All right, everybody, time to earn your keep. [chickens clucking] It's chickens who lay eggs, right? Do we really need to go over this again? No. [sheep bleating] Apparently, we do. Well, pay attention, Bucket. Wool. Eggs. Milk. Is that so hard now, see? [groans] Observe. Just grab the udder like so, and pull. [yak moos] Uh, pull. [yak moos] Pull...! Uh-oh, I think we're empty. That's not good. Yahoo! [laughs] [upbeat music] Whoa! Hey, Astrid! Oops. Did I do that? Hey! Not fair. Aah! [loud thud] [grunts] So it's gonna be like that, huh? Whoa! Unh! Hey! It was her idea, but I approve! [laughs] [distant rumbling] Uh-oh. [clicking] Unh! [dragon roars] Aah! Aah! [grunts] [clicking] The tail is frozen. Astrid! [gasps] Aah! [shouts] [screams] Hang on! [grunting] Aah! Come on! No! Go back! [grunts] Both : [screaming] [shivering] [groans] Astrid? Over here. Hiccup, I'm freezing. Come here. Where are the dragons? Toothless? Stormfly? Yeah. I see daylight! [dragon grunts] We're gonna get out of here. Look what they did. They saved our lives. Oh. Um, uh... Um... What's... uh, so... [clears throat] so we're good now? Good as new. Ow! [dragon grunts] Ah, uh-huh. Uh-huh, there it is, mm-hmm. [yaks mooing] Just what I thought. She's not giving milk. None of 'em are. [sighs] We know that, Gobber. We want to know why. This reminds me of the time I moved my mother in with my goat. She was mean, ornery, ate everything in sight. The goat was so scared of her, she couldn't give milk. So what are you saying, Gobber? Mothers and goats don't mix. Same with farm animals and dragons. We stopped fighting the dragons, so now they're around all the time. The animals are spooked. [dragons shrieking] [sheep bleating] Like I said. Spooked. [grunting] [groans] Uh-oh. Your Bucket's not tightening up on you, is it? No, I'm just... fine! Well, whenever his Bucket gets tight, it means a storm is coming. No storm. Everything's fine. Bucket... I don't want there to be a storm! If lightning strikes my Bucket, I could end up less intelligent. [screams] Ow! [moaning] Oh-ho-ho, that's one tight Bucket. And the tighter the Bucket, the bigger the storm. But that's crazy. Storms don't hit this early in the season. And besides, who ever heard of predicting the weather with a bucket? Heh, that's what chicken bones and goose feet are for. If you recall, that Bucket of his predicted the blizzard of Olaf. That was a bad one. It took us a week just to dig Mildew out. And the rest of our lives to wonder why we bothered... Trust the Bucket, Stoick. You trust the Bucket. I want a second opinion. Gothi, I've come for your council. Is there going to be a storm? What's she saying, Gobber? She says, "what do you think?" Huh? [both gasp] How can you be so sure? Was it the chicken bones or the goose feet? Uh-huh, uh-huh, yep. She says she could hear Bucket screaming from way up here. And then the dragons used their wings to block the snow. I've never heard of anything like that. Not even in the book of dragons. I know! It was incredible. It's as if their protective instincts just kicked in. Who'd believe it? The dragons we fought for years came to our rescue. Yeah, if it weren't for them, we would have frozen to death. You know what, you could've used your own bodies to keep each other warm. Um... Who would do that? That's crazy. Hey, Astrid. If you're still cold... Hey! Hey, Hiccup... your father's looking for you. He looked angry. He's looked angry since the day I was born, but I'm sure there's no connection. [dragon grunts] With a bad storm coming, we could be locked in. We might not be able to hunt or fish for months. But it's way too early for a storm. We're in the middle of winter. Devastating winter isn't due for another month. Not according to gothi. But what am I supposed to do? I can't control the weather. No, but you can control dragons. If they don't stop scaring the animals, we won't have any provisions to live on. [door opens] Ah, any luck? Not a drop. And this is after yanking on that poor yak for three hours. But it's not like the dragons are trying to be scary. I mean, they don't even eat farm animals. They eat fish. True. But they're huge, they breathe fire. And now that we've made peace with them, they're everywhere. The animals are terrified of them. Here's where you jump in and say, "I'll fix this." Okay, but how long do I have before the storm hits? About a week. No problem. More than enough time. [groans] Correction. Three days, six hours. Okay, less time might be more of a problem. Come on, wait for it. You can do it.  [yaks mooing] [grunts] Come on. [yak moos] [grunts] You'll really like them if you get to know them. The dragons look scary, but they're just big, scaly reptiles. Just like Snotlout. [chuckles] You're the guy, right? [high-pitched voice] No. [dragons roar] [yak moos] [chickens clucking] [dragons roaring] 
 
 Okay, what if we looked at this from an animal's perspective? Oh, hello, Mr. Dragon. I'm just a little sheep here, walking, doing sheep things. [imitates sheep bleating] No, he doesn't really seem so big and... Whoa! [whimpering] Sorry, but I'm siding with the sheep on this one. Look, I've learned that once you have a positive experience with something you're afraid of, it isn't so scary anymore. Okay, there you go, boys. Over here. And that's what we'll have to do with these sheep. We gotta prove to them they have nothing to fear... [dragon sniffs, sneezes] [sheep bleating] Oh, at this rate, we'll never get any milk or eggs. [wind howling] [groans] Just as I feared. We haven't had time to fully stock the food storehouse. If this storm is as bad as we think it is, we're never going to survive. Not with this inventory. We're going to need everything we can get from those chickens and yaks. I'm not really comfortable putting my fate in the hands of a brainless bird and a big, woolly beast that sleeps in its own dung. Well, luckily our fate isn't in their hands. It's in my son's. [animals all shrieking at once] Another way for the animals to overcome their fear is to show them that dragons are afraid of things too. Remember Magnus the Merciless? He was a pretty scary guy. [shivers] I was afraid of him until I learned that he was afraid of the dark. So during the day, Merciless. And during the night, Tuffnut. Unh! Ow! Hey! That's a real problem. I'm just saying, knowing he was afraid of something made him less scary to me. Yes, so let's show the yaks that dragons are afraid of things too. [dragons roaring] [yaks mooing] I think it's working. [dragon roars] [sheep bleats] Aah! Don't worry. Worry? I'm not worried. Do I look worried? [thunder rumbling] Bring in everything you need. We don't know how long we'll need to be hunkered down. [groaning] How's Bucket doing? Look at him. He usually loves a wheelbarrow ride. [whimpering] [thunder rumbling] [groaning] Mulch, I'll take care of Bucket. You and Gobber go find the kids and bring them here. [whimpering] Hey! Calm down. Get back over here. [yaks mooing] You know what I'm learning from this? Chickens are really, well... chicken. What if we showed them how much they have in common with the dragons? They both lay eggs, right? A Terrible Terror laid one last week. [chickens clucking] All right, see? An egg's an egg, right, ladies? [chickens shrieking] Whoa, whoa, whoa! Until it explodes. Everybody out. The storm is here! Wait, we haven't made any progress with the animals. Your father wants everyone in the great hall. Take the others. I need to stay and keep working with the animals. They're still afraid. You can't get eggs from a frozen chicken. We've got to get the animals in the barn! [wind howling] [thunder rumbling] So much for the barn. There's no other place to hold them! The great hall! So we're going to have the dragons and the animals under the same roof? We know that won't work. We have no choice. Let's go. All right, keep up. Shepherd them. This way! Come on, come on! Let's go! This way, guys! [thunder rumbling] [dragon chirps] [dragon roars] [yaks mooing] [sheep bleating] Hey, I've got this under control. Aah! Aah! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow. Okay, everything hurts. [yaks mooing] Whoa! Whoa! [grunting] Whoa! Aah! [chicken clucking] [sheep bleating] [groans] Where are you going? I'm going after them! Forget it, Hiccup! We'll never get them rounded up in this storm! With Toothless, I can. I have to try. If I don't, we starve to death. No, your father would kill me if I left you out here. Sorry, Gobber. Hiccup, come back here! Astrid, will you talk some sense... Oh, not you too! Astrid! You're not going with... Get back here, all of you! [wind howling] [door banging] [wind howling] Move those tables against the doors! Stoick, the barn's been destroyed! The animals have scattered. Where's Hiccup and the others? I tried to stop him, Stoick. They went after the animals. I caught these two. I figured at least with these, we'd be able to start a new herd. [yaks mooing] You might want to take another look, Mulch. Oh, uh, never mind, boys. You find as many as you can! We'll herd them back to the great hall. Can we swing by my house? I'd like to get my heavy coat. Check this out. I'm so cold, I can't feel my face! [grunts] Didn't feel it. That takes all the fun out of it. [dramatic music] There they are. Come on! Yaks to the left! Chickens to the right! Hey, I'm flying here! [chickens clucking] Chickens, over here! Follow me this way, come on! Wait, where are you going? [screaming] Whoa! Sheep! Hey, sheep! This way! Baa! Baa! Baa! Hey, it's working! Baa! Baa! [sheep bleating] [loud thump] Baa... I got them! Now! [sheep bleating] Gotcha! Aah! [screams] Snotlout, what are you doing? You're all over the place. You try herding chickens with a dragon that doesn't listen to you! Hiccup! Stray sheep! [sheep bleating] [sheep bleating] Good job, bud. Hiccup, the storm is getting worse. I can't see anything. Come on, bud, give us some light. Stray yaks, 12:00! I see them, and they are huge! Unh! I got the yaks. Put me down! Right now! [grunting] Do I look like a yak to you? [yak grunts] You shouldn't be out here, Hiccup. Dad, I'm sorry I let you down. It's not your fault, son. I'm taking you back. Which way? Follow our tracks. So much for that idea. Sir, what do we do now? [all shivering] Everyone, come together. [all shivering] [dragon growls] What are they doing? They're protecting us. It's their natural instinct. Ooh. [sheep bleating] [uplifting music] [sheep bleating] [chickens clucking] Your dragons are really something, son. Yeah, they are. [cheering] They're back, and they're all right! And the animals are all right too. Uh-oh. Here come the dragons. Will you look at that! Hey, everyone! The chickens are laying eggs again. [cheers] I was right. Chickens do lay eggs. We made our peace with the dragons when we saw that we could trust them. Turns out they actually have instincts to protect us. All of us. Life on Berk just got a little warmer.
