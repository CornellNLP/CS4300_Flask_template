 Oh, no. 
  Oh, no. 
  Oh, no! 
  Oh, my God! 
  No. 
  Oh, where's my other shoe? 
  - What in HermÃ¨s Hell? 
  - Gloria, I There better be a good explanation for this! 
  As a matter of fact, I had a very good explanation for why I was passed out in a Lacy's display window. 
  Like all the best stories, it all started with a guy. 
  It had been a week since KO and I broke up. 
  And I guess you could say I was in my feelings about it. 
  Alexa, add ice cream to my grocery list. 
  I've added ice cream. 
  Everywhere I looked, I still saw him. 
  KO left a gaping hole in my heart and the only person who could possibly understand how I was feeling, was the same person I couldn't lean on anymore. 
  No, you knock first. 
  I thought I heard the rumblings of a friend-tervention. 
  You guys, I appreciate it, but I'm fine. 
  Truly. 
  Honey, you're wearing ballet flats. 
  You're clearly not fine. 
  You've barely slept since KO moved out. 
  I've always been a night owl. 
  Yeah, but you're usually up making clothes. 
  I just I haven't felt inspired. 
  We know the perfect cure to help you get over KO. 
  Girls night out! 
  Some dancing, some drinks We all chipped in, and used your employee discount code. 
  You guys Uh-huh They are beautiful! 
  Thank you! 
  I just don't feel up for it. 
  Katygirl! 
  - You gotta start dealing. 
  - I am. 
  By throwing myself into work. 
  And other than you three, it's the only thing keeping me from a complete meltdown. 
  I'm gonna be late. 
  Thank you. 
  So, Mr. Cabot, what is on the agenda for our morning meeting? 
  Well, I have a proposition for you, Miss McCoy. 
  Hmm. 
  I want you to meet the real Mr. Cabot. 
  As in, my father. 
  I'm having drinks with him at his private club, tonight. 
  You should come. 
  I don't know, Alex. 
  If we go directly to my dad, prove to him how talented you are, there's a chance he'll finally re-launch Cabot Records. 
  And he would adore you. 
  So, just you, me and your dad? 
  No Xandra? 
  No boards, no curve balls? 
  No curve balls. 
  And Xandra won't be there. 
  I promise. 
  And maybe you could play him something impromptu? 
  How 'bout it? 
  Sorry I missed your show last night. 
  It's okay. 
  An actual fire's a great excuse. 
  Besides, you were in the front row for the last two. 
  Jorge? 
  My parents are here. 
  Get dressed. 
  Ma? 
  Pop? 
  What did we talk about showing up unannounced? 
  This food is going to expire in two days. 
  Somebody's gotta eat it. 
  You must be Jorge's parents. 
  Hey. 
  Luis Lopez. 
  District 52 City Councilman, and my lovely wife, Luisa. 
  It's an honor. 
  Bernardo. 
  The pleasure is all mine. 
  Come downstairs to the bodega. 
  - Yeah, I'll make you a sandwich. 
  - Yeah. 
  Thanks, I gotta run. 
  But I eat like, six meals a day, so, I'm gonna take you up on that offer soon. 
  Okay? 
  - See ya, babe. 
  Bye. 
  - Bye. 
  Mwah. 
  Oh. 
  Jorge! 
  Mama! 
  - Are you? 
  - Yes! 
  But we just started dating so please don't make a big deal out of it. 
  Just, it's new, so My son with a firefighter. 
  I never thought you'd get a guy like that. 
  What's he, like, six foot two? 
  I think so. 
  What's a big, strong guy like him doing with a little guy like you? 
  Hey! 
  It's backwards. 
  The mannequin's torso, Katy. 
  She looks like that girl from The Exorcist. 
  Do you need a personal day? 
  No. 
  I need to be here, working. 
  It is the only thing that's keeping me sane. 
  Besides, I'm not allowed to wallow. 
  I'm the one who broke up with KO. 
  Doesn't make it any less painful. 
  They say it takes half the length of your relationship to fully heal. 
  And twice as long for women. 
  So twenty years. 
  Great. 
  Gloria's summoning you, Katy. 
  Ew, no. 
  Or should I say Lydia from Beetlejuice. 
  Refresh the flowers, light the Diptyques, brew the Earl Gray. 
  We're hosting a special visitor today. 
  Guy LaMontagne, Creative Director of the House of Karloff in Paris. 
  Rumor has it he's moved back to New York, permanently. 
  After ten long years, he broke it off. 
  Resigned. 
  To strike out on his own. 
  Now, Mrs. 
  Lacy has tasked me to convince him to sell at Lacy's, and only at Lacy's. 
  Okay, what can we do to help? 
  Well, for starters, my little storm cloud, purge whatever pedestrian personal drama you're going through, and beam. 
  We need to show Guy we're the only team worthy of selling his line. 
  Can you do that for me, Katy? 
  Can you beam? 
  Over here we have a spectacular view of the East River. 
  Talk about production value. 
  Looks great. 
  My crew is downstairs, is it okay if they start bringing stuff up? 
  Oh, yeah, feel free to get started. 
  So, you're roommates with KO. 
  He has mentioned in the past, you're at Tisch. 
  Yeah, I'm working on a thesis about the intersection of organized crime and homoeroticism in American cinema. 
  Wow, that sounds perfect for the first film to be made at the Pepper Plant. 
  Just be sure to keep it low profile, seeing as it's un-permitted. 
  Yeah, right, um I can only pay you half of what we talked about. 
  Love, I'm all for supporting the arts, but the place isn't free. 
  You know, there's a Warhol film called Couch. 
  It depicts the myriad sexual encounters that took place on his Factory's iconic settee. 
  It sort of became a centerpiece. 
  If you let me keep that couch, we've got a deal. 
  Done. 
  It's yours after tonight. 
  Great. 
  Oh, hello. 
  Uh, Raj, this is an art film, n'est-ce pas? 
  An erotic art film. 
  The Rodfather, Part II. 
  The Rodfather, Part II. 
  Okay. 
  Great. 
  I'm so glad you're sitting in this room with me, Guy, the very heart of Lacy's. 
  Our clients include Please don't start name dropping. 
  I don't care. 
  What a relief. 
  People can be so gauche about celebrities. 
  Look, I appreciate the meeting, the tea. 
  It really is a lovely store. 
  But, brick and mortar is a thing of the past. 
  And that's what Lacy's represents. 
  Well, what are you looking for? 
  I'm looking for the right home for my designs. 
  I respect the legacy, but looking around, it just feels a little old fashioned. 
  I'm not sure you get what I do. 
  Oh, I assure you, no one gets it more than Gloria. 
  She's admired your work ever since your trash bag dress hit the runway at New York Fashion Week. 
  That was McQueen. 
  Right. 
  No, of course, I knew that. 
  Yours was light bulbs. 
  My apologies, Guy, my girl's head must have caught in the revolving door on the way in. 
  No need to apologize, Ms. 
  Grandbilt. 
  She's helped me make up my mind. 
  It's just not the right fit. 
  Thank you, for your time. 
  You are so dead. 
  Gloria, that was an honest flub. 
  I just I haven't been sleeping Do you think I care about your sleep, Katy? 
  I lie awake, night after night, thinking about how to keep this store alive. 
  You have no idea what you and your flub just cost us. 
  Do we really need him that badly? 
  - We most certainly do. 
  - Mrs. 
  Lacy. 
  Our store is struggling. 
  Another bad year, we'll shutter. 
  Guy's line is what we needed to resuscitate us. 
  Mrs. 
  Lacy, I feel responsible, and I promise that I will fix it. 
  I highly doubt you'll manage that, Ms. 
  Keene. 
  Though if you did, by some miracle, it might convince me to let you keep your job. 
  Whenever I had a bad day at work, KO's the first person I would call. 
  My life was spiraling out of control. 
  I didn't know how to live without him. 
  Katy, love! 
  Hey, Pepper, you know Guy LaMontagne, right? 
  Ooh, do I ever. 
  We were both on the same 30 under 30 list. 
  We indulged in edibles on the photoshoot. 
  Right. 
  Any chance you can help me track him down tonight? 
  - It's an emergency. 
  - Absolutely. 
  I'll be right there. 
  First ever film to be shot at the Pepper Plant is a gay porno. 
  Okay, uh, Raj? 
  I just have to pop out for a sec. 
  My sister needs me. 
  Just Keep a good eye on the loft, will you? 
  Uh-huh. 
  Bottoms up, locas! 
  Mm-mm, okay. 
  - Ooh! 
  - So, what do we think? 
  Somebody's dressed up to meet Daddy Cabot. 
  It's Target, baby. 
  e-Mmm! 
  I just hope this says, I deserve a record deal. 
  - I'm obsessed. 
  - I'm borrowing it tomorrow. 
  And I'll meet up with you guys as soon as it's over. 
  Katy, why aren't you dressed? 
  Because I never get dressed before I know my destination. 
  Hey, Pep. 
  You hear back from Guy yet? 
  Oh. 
  Not yet. 
  But, it's very possible I have an old number for him. 
  Uh, Katy, I thought tonight was about getting over a guy, not chasing one down. 
  Ugh, guys. 
  Mrs. Lacy basically threatened to fire me if I don't find Guy LaMontagne and convince him to design a line for Lacy's. 
  Don't worry, you'll find him. 
  Ladies, be honest, this color make me look busted? 
  - What? 
  - Jorge. 
  You always look perfect. 
  I don't feel that way when I'm with beefcake Bernardo. 
  Seriously. 
  When I'm sitting next to him, I just I feel all those old insecurities I used to feel when I was growing up with my brothers, who are bros, in every sense of the word. 
  Why is Bernardo into me? 
  My dad doesn't even get it. 
  Don't do that. 
  Don't self sabotage. 
  That boy is smitten! 
  Invite him out. 
  You will be reminded of why he is into you. 
  - If you say so. 
  - I do. 
  But more importantly, we need to find someone for you, Katy. 
  - No. 
  - Mm-hmm. 
  A little palate cleanser. 
  Yes! 
  Making out with someone new always helps. 
  I am not kissing anyone. 
  - I'm not ready. 
  - Why not? 
  Besides, tonight is about saving my job. 
  All work and no play makes Katy a depressed girl. 
  Tonight we're gonna help you get down and dirty. 
  - And that's dirrty with two R's. 
  - Ahh. 
  - Yes. 
  - Eh? 
  Wow. 
  Somebody ring the alarm, a fires in the room - Ring the alarm - And I'm throwin' elbows - Ring the alarm - And I'm throwin' elbows - Ring the alarm - And I'm throwin' elbows Ooh, I'm overdue Give me some room, coming through Paid my dues, I'm in the mood Me and the girls gonna shake the room Tight hip-huggers Low for sure Shake a little somethin' On the floor I need that to get me off Sweat until my clothes come off It's explosive, speakers are pumping Still jumping, six in the morning Table dancing, glasses are crashing No question, time for some action Temperature's up 'Bout to erupt Gonna get my girls Get your boys Gonna make some noise Gonna get rowdy Gonna get a little unruly Get it fired up in a hurry Want to get dirty, it's about time That I came to start the party Sweat dripping over my body Dancing gettin' just a little naughty Want to get dirty It's about time for my arrival What? 
  Hi. 
  Wow, you look amazing. 
  Mm. 
  It's Target. 
  You ever been there? 
  He's gonna love you. 
  If you don't mind, Miss. 
  - What is this? 
  - It's standard. 
  It's just an NDA. 
  Just an NDA. 
  It just feels like I'm signing my voice away to Ursula. 
  Speak of the devil. 
  Hey, Dad. 
  This is Josie. 
  Hello, Josie. 
  This is a beautiful club, Mr. 
  Cabot. 
  Is that a Turner? 
  Good eye. 
  Are you a connoisseur? 
  Ah, I just love going to the Met. 
  Josie's art form is music, Dad. 
  She does an amazing "His Eye is On the Sparrow". 
  Would you? 
  Why should I feel discouraged Why should the shadows come Why should my heart be lonely And long for heaven and home I sing because I'm happy I sing because I'm free For his eye is on the sparrow And I know He watches Me, yeah. 
  Xandra, please, I was trying to hear Josie. 
  What are we drinking? 
  If we're considering a reboot of the record label, we should poach a household name. 
  Never mind Cabot Records. 
  You have bigger fish to fry. 
  Yeah, Xandra, aren't you supposed to be meeting that designer tonight? 
  To lock him in for Cabotoure. 
  com? 
  It's all in hand. 
  I'm going to meet with Guy LaMontagne at 11:00 for drinks at Studio 34. 
  Then, should you get going? 
  It's funny how you're always trying to get rid of me, Alex. 
  Yet, I remember a time, not too long ago, when you couldn't keep your hands off of me. 
  - Alexandra! 
  - What? 
  Alex and I were high school sweethearts. 
  That's how our parents met in the first place. 
  - Oh, my God. 
  - Then they got married, so that made us step-siblings. 
  Isn't that right, Brother Dearest? 
  - Josie, I can explain. 
  - Don't! 
  Please, please don't. 
  I can't believe I'm saying this, but you and Xandra It makes perfect sense, in a sick, depraved kind of way. 
  Mr. 
  Cabot, they have been toying with me since I set foot in New York, and I have put up with it for the sake of my career. 
  And the only thing that means more to me than my music is my self-respect. 
  Josie! 
  Don't you dare follow me, Alex! 
  Hey, Josie, how'd it go? 
  Let's just say the Cabots make Flowers in the Attic seem like The Brady Bunch. 
  But I did get some intel. 
  Xandra is meeting Guy at Studio 34, to court him for Cabotoure. 
  com. 
  Pepper, can you get us in? 
  Can I? 
  They practically beg me to show up. 
  We are about to show up! 
  - Josie, we'll meet you there. 
  - Woo! 
  - Woo! 
  - Come on. 
  I mean, I knew something was off about the Cabots, but even I wouldn't have predicted twincest. 
  They're not twins. 
  They're not even related! 
  Oh, God, the robe. 
  - Mm - Whoa. 
  No, Pepper, you cannot write about this in your column. 
  I signed an NDA. 
  All right, my lips are zipped. 
  I know all about NDAs. 
  I've been at parties with the women who inspired Hustlers, for goodness sake. 
  Hey, Bernardo, it's me again. 
  I don't know if you got my text, but the girls and I are headed to Studio 34, if you wanna join? 
  - No answer. 
  - Maybe he's working late. 
  Or maybe he just realized we're not in the same league. 
  Oh, God! 
  A cat just ran over my foot and under that bag of trash. 
  Yeah, Josie, that was a rat. 
  Pepper, I thought you said you were a VIP. 
  Why are we not going through the front? 
  Because we need to say hello to Claude. 
  Claude? 
  Who's Claude? 
  Claude, darling! 
  Hey, Pepper. 
  How many tonight? 
  Come on. 
  Very good. 
  Very good. 
  God, I love Claude! 
  Oh, my God, is that SJP? 
  Yes! 
  Oh, my G Oh, excuse me, ladies, but I belong with that tall, tasty snack - upstairs. 
  - Mm-hmm. 
  There he is. 
  Okay, now what do we do? 
  Okay, we need to get Xandra away from Guy so that Katy and I can swoop in. 
  It's easy. 
  Xandra can't resist a chance to insult me. 
  - Taking one for the team. 
  - Thank you! 
  - Okay. 
  - Moment of truth. 
  Okay, now's our opening. 
  Are you ready? 
  - As I'll ever be. 
  - Good. 
  Come. 
  Well, well, well, Pepper Smith! 
  I didn't know you were in New York. 
  Well, what can I say? 
  The city called, and I answered. 
  I believe you know my friend. 
  Mr. 
  LaMontagne, I am so sorry about this morning, but mistaking your work for McQueen is a compliment. 
  That it is. 
  All right, well, Katy is my nearest and dearest. 
  Hear her out, will you? 
  Do you like tequila, Katy? 
  I sure do! 
  Pepper snuck us in here! 
  How did you manage it? 
  - FDNY, baby. 
  - Oh, yeah? 
  Yeah. 
  On the house. 
  Thank you for your service. 
  Thank you. 
  Wow! 
  Must be nice. 
  Only one of the few perks of being the guy that runs into a burning building. 
  Hey, is, uh, this seat taken? 
  Yes! 
  He's with me. 
  Why don't you back off? 
  Relax. 
  What's with you? 
  I don't know! 
  You didn't text me back earlier and I guess I just started to spiral. 
  - It's nothing. 
  Sorry. 
  - Hey. 
  Hey. 
  I'm here with you. 
  Okay? 
  I cannot believe you followed me here. 
  Not everything's about you, Xandra. 
  Is it that you can't get enough Cabot? 
  Or, do you want to reprise our duet? 
  Remember when we played you my demo and you said that I wasn't good enough? 
  Well, that weighed on me. 
  It made me doubt myself. 
  But now, now I feel great. 
  Because I realize it had nothing to do with me or my talent. 
  Those were the words of a bitter, jealous ex-girlfriend. 
  You know, you're actually a good singer. 
  Just leave me alone. 
  I mean it. 
  Even if step-daddy doesn't think so. 
  Window displays are the most underrated art form of our time! 
  The ones at Lacy's have been captivating New Yorkers for over a hundred years. 
  I'm a sucker for a good holiday window. 
  That is something an Online retailer could never provide for you. 
  Look, I appreciate the pluckiness, but it's not gonna happen. 
  Fine. 
  There are dozens of other designers who would happily take your place. 
  So, give one of them a call. 
  Guy, is this girl bothering you? 
  She was just leaving. 
  So. 
  Now, where were we? 
  Whoo! 
  I blew it. 
  Come morning, I will be out of a job. 
  And now I'm crying in a club. 
  I'm one of those people? 
  Oh, my God, is this my rock bottom? 
  - Katy - Why don't we go home? 
  More little cups of alcohol, please. 
  - KO, he's here. 
  - What? 
  Oh, my God, we have to get out of here before he sees us! 
  Too late. 
  Can we dance, please? 
  - Finally! 
  - Yes! 
  - Raj, everything okay? 
  - Uh, not really. 
  A neighbor saw us through the window and called your landlady. 
  She's here and pissed. 
  All right, Raj, Raj, just take a breath. 
  Listen, um, here's what we're gonna do Start by bringing out the wardrobe rack into the hall. 
  So, do random guys, like, hit on you everywhere you go? 
  What's going on with you? 
  Did I do something wrong? 
  No, you're perfect. 
  Everywhere you go, people just shower you with drinks and adoration. 
  That guy at the bar couldn't even fathom a world where we were together. 
  Jorge, come on, seriously? 
  Why are you with me? 
  Boys, I need you. 
  It's urgent. 
  I didn't take you for a Studio 34 kind of guy. 
  I'm not here to hang out, Katy. 
  They need a bouncer, I'm interviewing. 
  What about Molly's Crisis? 
  I quit. 
  I figured you'd want it in the divorce. 
  You quit your job so you wouldn't have to run into me? 
  Wow! 
  You must really want to avoid me. 
  I think you've had a lot to drink. 
  Do you want me to get you some water? 
  No. 
  Please, just stop being so nice to me. 
  I've been a mess, KO. 
  You still look beautiful. 
  As always. 
  Why didn't you answer my text? 
  The one that asked how I am? 
  How was I supposed to respond, Katy? 
 
 
 
  I'm miserable. 
  And you're the one who made me feel that way. 
  I'm sorry, I gotta go. 
  Take care of yourself. 
  Raj? 
  Where are we at? 
  Ah, nowhere good! 
  I'm losing shooting time and the mafiosos are losing their erections. 
  So, you're the nightmare tenant! 
  Pepper Smith. 
  Pleasure. 
  This is totally unacceptable, let alone, illegal. 
  They better shut this production down right now or I'll call the police. 
  Mrs. 
  Morton, I'm sure we can come to some sort of arra If that's another shirtless man, I swear We received several noise complaints. 
  Which one of you is the owner, here? 
  I'm gonna need to see a permit. 
  I am, and there is no permit. 
  This is an unauthorized use of my space. 
  Ma'am, don't worry. 
  We're gonna shut this down immediately. 
  Well, good. 
  Thank you, officers. 
  And you, Ms. Smith, If I get another call like tonight's, you'll be out on the street. 
  Oh, my God! 
  Hey, do you act? 
  You'd be great in my next film. 
  Uh, no. 
  Jorge, he's the actor. 
  You were so great back there. 
  Yeah, and yet, you're the one who keeps getting singled out. 
  So, I look like a p0rn cop, great. 
  Look, Jorge, let's go get something to eat and go somewhere quiet where we can talk. 
  I'm sorry. 
  I started the night with my girls, and I'm gonna end it with them. 
  Mmm. 
  There you are, girls! 
  Thank God! 
  We're sorry for the French Exit. 
  We had a minor emergency at the Plant. 
  I forgive you, Pepper shaker. 
  Where's Bernie? 
  - Mm. 
  - I sent him home. 
  We kind of had a fight. 
  Just give me all the carbs. 
  Hello? 
  Josie McCoy? 
  This is Mr. 
  Cabot's office. 
  He's requested to see you tomorrow morning, 8:00 a. m. at his club. 
  Don't be late. 
  Mr. Cabot wants to see me. 
  Uh, uh, uh, don't even think about not showing up. 
  How'd it go with KO? 
  It was awkward and sad. 
  He KO quit Molly's Crisis. 
  - What? 
  - End of an era. 
  No, he quit for me. 
  Even post break up, he's still the greatest guy in the world. 
  Oh, my God, you guys, it's Guy. 
  Hold my pizza. 
  No, never mind. 
  No time. 
  Bye! 
  - Where are you going? 
  - Put your shoes on. 
  Hey! 
  You! 
  Whoa! 
  Wow! 
  Do I need a restraining order? 
  Nope. 
  I just have one last thing to say to you. 
  Your work at Karloff was totally overrated. 
  Wow. 
  That is the first honest thing I've heard all day. 
  I was starting to wonder if the old New York was gone forever. 
  The city I grew up in, people, they told you what they really thought no matter who you were. 
  I grew up here, too. 
  So, tell me what you really think. 
  What do you care if I go to Lacy's or not? 
  Aren't you just an assistant? 
  Isn't this just a job? 
  No, it's not just a job. 
  Lacy's has always been a home to me. 
  It is for a lot of us. 
  You said that Lacy's was a thing of the past, and you were right. 
  But That's what makes it so magical. 
  I wish that you could see it through my eyes. 
  - So, show me. 
  - What? 
  Show me your Lacy's. 
  Give me a tour. 
  Okay. 
  Mrs. 
  Lacy sold Jackie-O her first pill-box hat at this counter. 
  When you buy something from Lacy's, you're engaging with history. 
  Literally, you're creating a memory that stays with you forever. 
  So, tell me yours. 
  Okay. 
  I was six, and my mom brought me here after school. 
  And we found this candy apple red cashmere sweater, which was 70 percent off because it had a hole in the sleeve. 
  I remember how it faintly smelled like perfume. 
  How soft it was. 
  I remember my mom told me it would look pretty with my hair color. 
  She also said, that its imperfection is what makes it special. 
  That night we repaired it together. 
  Obviously, it doesn't fit me anymore, but I would never get rid of it, because it's so much more than just a sweater. 
  I was fifteen when my grandfather bought me my first leather wallet at Sears. 
  I've carried it with me ever since. 
  See? 
  Guy that's my point. 
  No one is going to have a story to tell about your clothes if they're clicking them into a digital cart. 
  probably at 4:00 a. m. on a sleeping pill. 
  You had one of the best jobs in fashion at Karloff. 
  Why did you leave? 
  A year ago, I was so desperate to break out on my own, to assert my own identity. 
  - But, now - You're terrified. 
  Karloff was stable and safe, and leaving was like jumping without a safety net. 
  But you had to do it. 
  Sounds like you can relate. 
  Yeah, I left someone recently. 
  I know the future feels uncertain, but you just have to follow your heart. 
  Even when it hurts. 
  And you cannot tell me that your heart is in Xandra Cabot's Cabotoure. 
  Maybe not, but even you have to admit that Lacy's is the riskier choice. 
  This may not even be here in five years. 
  How can I bet my future on that? 
  By connecting to its past. 
  Did you know that Halston had his very own atelier on the eighth floor of Lacy's in the 60s? 
  He did? 
  What if I told you that you could have the entire eighth floor for your very own atelier? 
  You're an assistant, you can't promise me a whole floor. 
  Maybe not, but I'm doing it anyway. 
  Halston's one of the reasons I became a designer. 
  I know. 
  Me, too. 
  You threw up on Guy LaMontagne? 
  No, just in my handbag. 
  - Oh, no, you didn't, girl. 
  - Ohh. 
  And a little bit on my dress and my coat. 
  Oh, no! 
  Guy gave me his jacket. 
  He's more of a gentleman than I thought. 
  - Mmm. 
  - Okay, so any chance you were able to convince him to work with Lacy's between heaves? 
  No, I ran to the bathroom, and when I came out, he was gone, so, no. 
  I'm sorry, Katy. 
  Why don't you come on home? 
  I will. 
  I just need to close my eyes for a second. 
  That night, in a Lacy's Fifth Avenue window, I slept for the first time since I broke up with KO. 
  And that's how I got here. 
  There better be a good explanation for this! 
  Gloria, I can explain. 
  Save it for Mrs. 
  Lacy. 
  She's requested to see you immediately. 
  Never, once, in the long history of Lacy's, has a shop girl ever behaved in such an atrocious manner. 
  Breaking in during the night? 
  Sleeping in our window? 
  And then, I got a call from Guy LaMontagne. 
  He said he's picked us to be his exclusive retailer, as long as we give him the entire eighth floor for his own atelier? 
  Putting aside the fact that handing out floors is far beyond your pay grade, the space isn't even available! 
  I know, and I am so sorry. 
  But, could we not, perhaps, move our overstock storage to the basement? 
  While I do not condone Katy's methods, having Guy set up shop here could keep Lacy's relevant for years to come. 
  I suppose it's worth considering. 
  Thanks for coming. 
  I know my spiral yesterday was not cute. 
  The thing is growing up, I never felt like I was masculine enough for my dad. 
  And, then you come along, and you're New York's manliest man. 
  All those old insecurities just come out to party. 
  I'm just sorry I took it out on you. 
  It's okay. 
  I get it. 
  To answer your question from last night I'm with you because you're sexy, and you're talented, and you're brilliant. 
  You became a cop last night. 
  I played Officer Krupke senior year of high school. 
  When you're on stage, I'm gone for you. 
  Jorge you're a star. 
  You were never actually making an art film, were you, Raj? 
  I have a lot of student loans and p0rn pays well. 
  - Well. 
  - But, I wanna be a great filmmaker some day. 
  An artist. 
  Well, I can see it. 
  Seriously. 
  With the right music, and editing we could spin this as experimental erotica. 
  - Hmm. 
  - The first Warholian film ever to be made at the Pepper Plant. 
  I can work with this. 
  Okay. 
  Are you seeing Bernardo tonight? 
  No, he's working. 
  Hold onto that guy, because you won't find that again. 
  Pops. 
  Cut it out. 
  When you say stuff like that it feels like you don't think I deserve to be with a guy like Bernardo. 
  When I do. 
  I'm just kidding around, Mijo. 
  It's a way to talk. 
  Yeah, but it's how you've been talking to me my entire life. 
  I'm sick of it. 
  Pops, I know how you look at me. 
  You think I'm different from the other guys, that you wish I could be more masculine. 
  No, I don't, Jorge. 
  Yes. 
  Yeah, you do. 
  But I'm not changing. 
  Not for you, not for anyone. 
  And just so you know, Bernardo thinks I'm plenty man enough. 
  That was quite the performance you gave last night. 
  Oh, that was nothing. 
  I wanted to let you know that I'm not rebooting Cabot Records. 
  Not yet. 
  But your talent is undeniable. 
  However, talent alone isn't enough. 
  What people really respond to is fire. 
  That's what makes a star. 
  And you certainly made a fiery exit last night. 
  I've never seen anyone stand up to my son and Xandra like you did. 
  Other than me, of course. 
  Well, yeah. 
  I want to give you the chance to prove yourself. 
  I'm willing to fund your first EP. 
  - Oh! 
  - And in exchange, I'd like you to do me a favor. 
  I want you to help keep Alex on the straight and narrow. 
  What does that mean, exactly? 
  My son has demons, but he seems to focus excel, even when dating a woman of strong moral character. 
  I can tell that he listens to you. 
  Mr. 
  Cabot, your son and I did have a thing, but we ended it, okay. 
  We've decided to keep it professional. 
  I trust you can make it work. 
  When I got home that night, instead of watching another sad movie, I finally started to sketch again. 
  And I started to sew. 
  I finally started to let go of KO. 
  I'd been so scared because I didn't think I'd be any good at being by myself. 
  But sitting there at my sewing machine, I was reminded that there were other things I loved. 
  It would take awhile until I was fully healed, but at least I wasn't falling apart at the seams anymore. 
  And I wasn't alone, after all. 
  I had the city, my friends, my work, and right now, that was enough. 
  - I didn't need a - Guy! 
  Hey, I'm glad I ran into you. 
  I found this in my car. 
  Is there any chance it belongs to you? 
  I have a jacket that is yours as well. 
  What are you doing here? 
  I have a meeting with Mrs. 
  Lacy about my new atelier. 
  Apparently a certain assistant has more pull than I gave her credit for. 
  Well, you're welcome. 
  Hopefully it's not as overrated as my last effort. 
  Hmm. 
  We'll see about that.
