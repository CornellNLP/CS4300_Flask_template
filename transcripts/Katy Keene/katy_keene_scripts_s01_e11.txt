 [KATY] The Meta Gala is fashion's biggest night. 
 My mom and I used to park ourselves across the street and gawk at the gorgeous gowns. 
 It was our Oscars, Super Bowl, Thanksgiving Day Parade, all wrapped into one. 
 Back then, I had no idea how much work went into each of those dresses. 
 The boning, the underpinnings, the detailing. 
 It took an entire team of people to put it all together. 
 My mom always told me that one day, 
 I'd get to attend the Meta Gala as a designer. 
 That I'd be the one walking the red carpet and showcasing my work. 
 But for now, I was just happy to be this close. 
 The theme is "Behind the Mask", and this feels like the opposite. 
 It's not so different from the sketch you approved, which Casey Wilson loved. 
 I didn't think you'd make a train longer than Rihanna's Guo Pei number. 
 This is your first Meta Gala gown at your own label. 
 - It has to be good. 
- Katy? 
 Yeah? 
 What do you think? 
 I think that a shorter train will give Casey more mobility 
 without sacrificing the integrity of the design. 
 One less foot, and she will practically float down the red carpet. 
 Good point. 
 Let's lose a foot. 
 [KATY] I am living the dream! 
 Watching Guy LaMontagne work, it's... 
 - A major turn-on. 
- Yes. No! 
 It's... [SIGHS] It's inspiring me. 
 Well, I hope it inspired you to pay the rent. 
 Oh, my God, I completely forgot. 
 Between Guy and running Personal Shopping with Amanda during peak Meta Gala season, 
 I completely lost track of time. I'm sorry. 
 I haven't. 
 It's been twelve days since Jorge put on that sweatshirt. 
 This is all I have left of Bernardo. 
 - Aww. 
- It smells like him. 
 Babe, it just smells. 
 Katy... [SIGHS] what helped you get over KO? 
 I don't think I'll ever truly be over him. 
 Well, at least you still have his underwear ads. 
 [PHONE BUZZING] 
 Oh, my gosh. 
 Amanda keeps sending me old Meta Gala looks. 
 As if I don't have every single dress ever worn committed to my memory. 
 What happened to quitting Lacy's? 
 Well, Gloria happened. 
 When she found out that Mrs. Lacy put me and Amanda in charge, she asked me to stay. 
 She wants me to take care of her domain. 
 Oh, my God! 
 - Katy... 
- Yeah. 
 It's from Parson's. 
 How long has that been there? 
 I don't know, Jorge's in charge of the mail. 
 It's a lot of catalogs. 
I get overwhelmed. 
 I always thought my mom would be here for this. 
 Oh... I'm so lucky to have you guys here. 
 Okay... here we go. 
 - [NERVOUS LAUGH] 
- [EXHALES] 
 [EXHALES] 
 Maybe it's better that my mom's not here to see this. 
 [SHAKY BREATH] 
 Oh, Katy. 
 It's totally okay. 
 You know, wasn't meant to be. 
 My love, it's okay not to be okay, you know. 
 Yeah, I know that. 
 What do I have to be upset about? 
 I am helping Guy LaMontagne design a dress for the Meta Gala. 
 I'm fine. Really. 
 [SIGHS] 
 Ohh. What is that faraway look in your eyes, Katy? 
 It's the week of the Meta Gala. 
 Snap to it! 
 Sorry, but... 
 I just... I don't ever remember Gloria's office being this messy when she was here. 
 [AMANDA] We are dressing twenty A-listers for the Meta Gala, and you have been MIA with Guy LaMontagne. 
 Who is designing a line for Lacy's. 
 His Meta Gala dress takes priority. 
 Don't do that. Do not do that. 
 Don't bat your fake eyelashes at me. 
 You and I both know that I deserve to be Head Shopper. 
 Amanda, why must you make every single thing a competition? 
 Mrs. Lacy put both of us in charge. 
 Exactly. So pull your weight! 
 - Okay. 
- [PHONE BUZZES] 
 - If you abandon me one more time... 
 Guy asked me to help with Casey Wilson's dress. 
 I'm sorry, but... 
 Ohh. 
 Here. 
 "What Would Gloria Grandbilt Do?" 
 - Yeah. 
- No, thanks. 
 Gloria sent it over that time she had food poisoning from a bad batch of caviar. 
 So it has everything you need to know, and I will come back and I will help you. I promise. 
 [HANNAH] This is where you're taking your meetings now? 
 It's appalling how much you've lowered your standards. 
 Imagine how low they had to be when I married you. 
 What do you want, Hannah? I'm busy. 
 Megan Ellison isn't coming. 
 I canceled on your behalf. 
When Didi defected, she took your little black book with her. 
 Okay, let's just put everything out on the table, 
 - shall we? 
- Mm. 
 I did you dirty in Morocco. 
Our marriage failed. 
 You've already got your money back from me. 
 You've stolen my assistant. 
 Do you really have to ruin my entire life? 
 Yes! I want you to feel as much pain as I felt when you let me rot in prison. 
 - You were there for three days! 
- Semantics! 
 I'm hurting you where it hurts you the most, Pepper: your bank account. 
 You are right about one thing. 
 New York does need more spaces for creative types. 
 But you're stuck in the past. 
 This pre-Giuliani, squatter-chic vibe you're going for? No, New York has changed. 
 People want a more... polished place. 
 Like the Hannah House. 
 [LAUGHS] The Hannah House? 
 Mm-hmm. Has a nice ring, no? 
 It's an upscale workspace, social club, and hotel for rich creative types. 
 But it's a costly venture. 
 Good thing I'm poaching all your investors. 
 Ciao for now. 
 [PEPPER] You haven't been contacted by a Hannah Melvey? 
 Hannah who? 
 I don't answer calls from people I don't know. 
 Good. 
 Okay, I know that your investment in Spider Woman didn't pan out, but I do have another, even better, business opportunity for you. 
 The Pepper Plant. 
 I thought you already had funding. 
 I did... I mean, I do. I do. 
 I've just had to accelerate the launch, thanks to a competitor. 
 But you know, less time means more capital. 
 I don't know, Pep. It's not always good to mix friends with money. 
 What if I told you that Josie and the Pussycats could be the Plant's house band. 
 Okay, it would be the perfect place 
 for us to work out our new material. 
 You know, like the Beatles in Hamburg? 
 Yeah, that's great for the band, but look, I'm less sure about it as an investment. 
 Nobody knows about the Pepper Plant. 
 You leave that bit to me, Alex. 
 - [DOOR OPENS] 
- [MATEO] I'm looking for my brother. 
 - [JORGE] Ugh! 
- What's up, bro? 
 I was patrolling the neighborhood, figured I'd swing by. 
 What, did Dad tell you to spy on me? 
 No, man, but he does ask about you. 
 Why don't you come to dinner? 
 It's killing Ma not having everyone together. 
 I'm not ready to face Dad, bro. 
 I'm not defending him, but you gotta try and see this 
 from his perspective. You had been attacked that night. 
 Okay? Our pops is terrified for you. 
 and we haven't caught the guys who did it. 
 Stop making excuses for him. 
 I'm just saying that, you know, 
 you've been with the drag thing for years, 
 he's only been with it for a few weeks. 
 You might need to give Pops a little time to process. 
 Process? Stop making me feel like 
 I'm something people gotta get used to. 
 - I'm sorry. 
- Mm. 
 We love you, Jorge. All of us do. 
 Okay? 
 I know. 
 Don't give up on him yet. 
 Okay. 
 - [KEYS JINGLE] 
- All right. 
 [DOOR CLOSES] 
 When I heard the theme was Behind the Mask, 
 I knew I wanted to show the world 
 the real Casey Wilson, not just the actress. 
 I'm not sure the real me loves a corset. 
 Sorry, Guy, but I look like I'm about to throw cake 
 at a bunch of French peasants. 
 Well, the corset is subversive, that's the point. 
 This is alarming. 
 Also, I'm finding breathing a challenge. 
 Guy, I'm so sorry, and you know, 
 I love everything that you make... 
 you know, except for this. 
 I'm just getting totally lost in this dress 
 and whatever is going on up here. 
 Is it too late to just... start over? 
 Whip something else up from scratch? 
 We could make a few small adjustments, 
 maybe trade out the corset for a lace bodice? 
 My brother once got a dress ready for Annie Hathaway 
 thirty minutes before the Oscars. 
 He's a pro. He'll come back with something new. 
 Won't you, Guy? 
 Maybe we lose the corset 
 and... add a dramatic cape. 
 I am just spitballing. Ignore me. 
 [PHONE BUZZES] 
 This is the part I hate the most. 
 Which part? 
 Rejection. 
 How am I supposed to start over on a dress 
 and complete an entire line by Fashion Week? 
 By accepting help. 
 Casey looks amazing in lace appliqué. 
 I could look up photos of her wedding dress? 
 I appreciate your help, Katy. 
 But at a certain point, 
 the work can only be done by the designer. 
 [KATY] And not the girl who didn't even get into Parsons. 
 [PHONE BUZZES] 
 Well, I'm needed downstairs, 
 but I'm just a phone call away if you need me. 
 [GUY] Mm-hmm. 
 What's wrong? 
 You seem distracted. 
 It's about Pepper. 
 I want to help her 
 and I want to help the Pussycats 
 but... I don't know, there's something about her 
 that just doesn't sit well. 
 Yeah, I get it. 
 She can be a bit... 
 extra. 
 But I am telling you, 
 no one has more hustle than Pepper Smith. 
 And she's good people. 
 I believe you, but... 
 now that I'm cut off from my dad... 
 I just need to rein in my spending. 
 If I invest in this... 
 the rest of my savings'll be tied to the Pepper Plant. 
 I'll talk to her. 
 Make sure it's really worth pursuing. 
 Mm. 
 And she knows not to lie to me. 
 [CHUCKLES] Oh, and she's gotta guarantee 
 that you're the house band. 
 Okay. 
 'Cause an investment in Josie McCoy... 
 well, that's the surest thing I got. 
 [CHUCKLING] 
 [FRANCOIS] Kiss of the Spider Woman was great, but niche. 
 We need to do something bigger. 
 What about Ginger as Evita? 
 Here for it! 
 I think you need to start auditioning again. 
 I've been circling casting calls. 
 That's just because you don't like me performing in drag. 
 That's not fair. 
 I saw your show seventeen times! 
 To give me notes. 
 If I criticize you, 
 it's because I know what you're capable of. 
 Life is hard and messy, 
 and at any moment the bottom could fall out. 
 Mami... 
 is everything okay? 
 As a matter of fact, no. 
 Your father and you not talking, 
 it's taking its toll, and I'm tired of it. 
 Then tell it to your husband, 
 because this queen is in no mood for a guilt trip. 
 Jorge. Take it from me... 
 there are too many battles out there 
 to waste time fighting with family. 
 It's time to mend fences. 
 [GROANS] Fine. 
 But he better hop his ass over to my side of the fence. 
 What a marvelous idea to bring Katy some sustenance. 
 That girl is a heart-shaped Energizer Bunny 
 with dangerously low blood sugar. 
 [LAUGHS] Well, I figured she could use a pick-me-up 
 after the Parsons rejection. 
 Ah, yes. Ooh! Any news on Alex? 
 I talked to him, and he said that he would 
 invest in the Plant if you can guarantee 
 that the Pussycats will be the house band. 
 - Done. 
- Oh, but Pepper, 
 I have to say, after the whole... 
 Palace Hotel debacle... 
 Not my fault. 
 ... and the way you went behind our backs 
 and promised Xandra a role in Kiss of the Spider Woman, 
 Alex is... 
 in a vulnerable place. 
 If anyone understands what it's like 
 to be cut off by their parents, it's me. 
 Alex will get every penny of his investment back. Ten-fold. 
 You have my word. 
 Okay, well, then... [POPS LIPS] 
 you have Alex's money. 
 Oh! Oh, my God, thank you so much! 
 Things have been insane preparing for the Meta Gala. 
 Casey Wilson hates corsets, and Amanda 
 is extra demanding, if that's even possible, 
 and I literally haven't eaten all day. 
 Katy, do you need an ashwagandha? 
 No. No time. Bye! 
 [JOSIE] Is this it? 
 Is the Meta Gala gonna break Katy? 
 I don't know, but maybe it can help break us. 
 We have a bit of a publicity problem. 
 The world needs to know about the Pussycats, 
 and the Pepper Plant, and what better venue 
 to showcase our work than the Meta Gala? 
 Fuchsia crepe? 
 I am obsessed with this! 
 Katy, focus. We are looking for a dress 
 for Tavi Gevinson, not for you. 
 [KO] Sorry to interrupt. 
 Think you could squeeze me in? 
 - Wow! 
- Xandra said it looked sharp. 
 But... [LAUGHS] I told her it wasn't really my thing. 
 [CHUCKLES] I'll find something a little more you. 
 What's the occasion, anyway? 
 I got invited to the Meta Gala. 
 It turns out the whole underwear model thing 
 comes with some perks. 
 Give the bruiser a trophy... he just won your break-up. 
 Amanda, will you go find that black Armani, please? 
 Oh. Here. Try this. 
 So... the Meta Gala. That's... 
 - Wow! 
- If you told me a year ago 
 that I'd be walking a red carpet... 
 I'm happy for you, KO. 
 So, did you hear back from Parsons yet? 
 I didn't get in. 
 [FOOTSTEPS APPROACH] 
 So this is where you've been 
 while I've been trying to call you? 
 Guy, I'm so sorry, I turned my phone on silent 
 while we were fitting a client. 
 Katy, look, if you have better things to do 
 than help me with the Meta Gala, say the word. 
 'Cause there's a hundred other people 
 who would kill to take your place. 
 Take it down a notch, man. She said she was sorry. 
 I do not need you to fight my battles. 
 This is my boss, so please, pay a little respect. 
 Not if he doesn't respect you. 
 I think she can speak for herself. 
 Sometimes she talks so much, I can barely hear myself think. 
 Irreverent sense of humor. Just ignore it. 
 Don't talk about her like that. 
 KO, cut it out. Seriously. 
 Wait, Katy. This is KO? 
 The one you didn't want to marry? 
 [SIGHS] 
 Makes sense. 
 You're way too young to settle. 
 [KATY GASPS] KO! 
 Guy, I know that things got really out of hand 
 yesterday with KO, but it's almost noon. 
 Casey Wilson is on her way for a follow-up fitting, 
 and nobody knows what to work on without you. 
 [INTO PHONE] Hey, dumbass. 
 This is your sister. 
Where the hell are you? 
 - [PHONE BEEPS] 
- Tell me you've heard from him. 
 No, not yet. 
 But he seemed like he was spiraling 
 when he got into it with KO. 
 Your ex may have punched him, 
 but the worst thing a person can bruise on Guy is his ego. 
 This is about his career and the Meta Gala. 
 When he's in a creative pickle, he usually goes on a pub crawl. 
 White Horse Tavern all the way to Coogan's. 
 It's annoying, but the last one birthed 
 Karloff's 2018 collection. 
 Wait, what do I tell Casey? 
 Are you a good liar? 
 Tell her anything but the truth. 
 [CASEY] Did you have a face transplant 
 with a Disney princess? 
 Is that a real human face? 
 This is my face. 
 Where's Guy? 
 Guy... is... in the... atelier. 
 - Mm-hmm. He's just... 
- Oh. 
 really in that zone, and... 
 he's coming up with something very special for you. 
 I know when I'm being given the runaround. 
 I'm usually the one giving it, 
 because I just wanna stay home and watch the Real Housewives. 
 But the Gala is tomorrow, 
 and Christian Siriano just slid into my DMs. 
 So... should we call it? 
 No! No. 
 Look, I know... 
 that you have been to the Meta Gala seven times, 
 and that fashion is very important to you. 
 But only if it's a true expression of you. 
 So, Guy, he sent me here 
 to get to know you a little better. 
 - [KATY] Okay. 
 Hm. When and where were you happiest? 
 Right now. 
 I mean, not right now, this is miserable, 
 but generally, yeah. 
 I mean, if... if you really wanna know, 
 I just... I spent so much of my life 
 just acting like everything was perfect. 
 Ya know, I was the perfect friend and the perfect mom 
 and the perfect career woman, and... 
 I don't know, I just... I didn't want anyone to know 
 if I was ever struggling. 
 And I just... I tried so hard to hide those parts of myself 
 that I thought were broken. 
 It was exhausting. So one day I just stopped. 
 I just stopped trying to pretend 
 like I was superhuman, 'cause I'm not. And... 
 [SIGHS] honestly, to lay it all bare, 
 it felt fantastic. 
 You are amazing. 
 Listen, this has been a delight, 
 but I'm running late to meet Andrew Rannells for brunch, 
 and he is such a drag when he's hangry... 
 he's honestly abusive. 
 You tell Guy he has 24 hours to make me a new dress. 
 Guy will not let you down. 
 He is making you something really beautiful. 
 I think you might be the most earnest person I've ever met. 
 Never change. 
 [SIGHS] 
 [POP MUSIC PLAYING ON STEREO] 
 Pussycats just laid down our first new track... 
 [LAUGHING] and it is a banger. 
 Yeow! Go on! 
 [JOSIE LAUGHS] 
 What are you up to? 
 I have no idea. 
 I'm just following orders. Pep? 
 Let's just say Katy isn't the only one 
 making something for the Meta Gala. 
 It's for my plan. 
 - Should I be scared? 
- Yes! 
 Your mum's a lawyer, right? 
 You don't mind if I give her a ring 
 and ask for some legal counsel? 
 - For the plan? 
- The less you know, the better. 
 [KATY] Yeah, he's about 6'4", 
 probably wearing a turtleneck 
 and waxing poetic about Halston? 
 No? Okay, thanks anyway. 
 You guys, I've called every single Irish pub 
 in Manhattan, and there's no sign of Guy. 
 The Meta Gala is tomorrow, 
 and we have no dress for Casey Wilson. 
 Little did she know I lied, and I told her that Guy 
 could turn around a new look in 24 hours. 
 I mean, he's upset that his dress got rejected, 
 and I really get that, but he can't give up now. 
 [EXHALES] What do I do? 
 - Make it yourself. 
- Di-va! [SNAPS] 
 Well, I tried that once with Guy, 
 and it blew up in my face. 
 Plus, I don't think I have what it takes anymore. 
 I mean, this is the Meta Gala. 
 I'm just a Parsons reject. 
 - Uh-uh. 
- [JOSIE] Okay, you know what? 
 Enough with the self-loathing, Katy. 
 Just ask yourself: what would... 
 Gloria Grandbilt do? 
 I was gonna say Coco Chanel, but that works. 
 Gloria would take the bull by the horns. 
 I gotta go. 
 I'm not gonna ask. 
 [DOOR OPENS, CLOSES] 
 We are going to take the spirit 
 of what we already made with Guy, 
 but expose the imperfections. 
 The seams, the frayed edges... the broken parts. 
 And not a redesign, 
 a... deconstruction. 
 - [DOOR OPENS] 
- [FRANCOIS] Don't worry, Katy, 
 I know exactly what you mean. 
 You want a peek under the curtain of a dress. 
 Warts and all. 
 Jorge called. 
 Said you might need some moral support. 
 And somebody with sculpting skills. 
 You do realize that when we're through, 
 it's going to be a different dress. 
 Are you sure about this? 
 Not even a little bit. 
 Nice weather we're having. 
 Nice? Then call me Queen Elsa, 
 porque yo soy frozen. [SCOFFS] 
 That's because you wear crop tops year-round. 
 [LUIS] So, 
 how's, um, Bernardo? 
 Wouldn't know. The big, strong fireman 
 rejected your runt of a son, 
 but you saw that coming, right? 
 I'm really sorry. 
 What else are you sorry about? 
 About how I reacted to the, uh, 
 the cross-dressing thing. 
 It's not cross-dressing. It's drag. 
 Okay. Okay, I'm sorry I get the words wrong. 
 I'm trying to fix things between us, hijo. 
 Jorge, I'm okay with you doing drag. 
 All that I'm asking is that you don't walk home 
 dressed as a woman, okay? For your own safety. 
 Pops, I don't have to live by your rules. 
 As long as you live in my building, you do. 
 That's how it is? It's like that? 
 'Cause if that's the case, the girls and I will take 
 our hard-earned rent money and we'll go elsewhere. 
 Well, go ahead. Try and find something at this price. 
 Good luck out there. 
 Good luck out there? 
 That's exactly what you said to me 
 when I was 14 years old and you kicked me out. 
 That was a long time ago. 
 Really? Because for me, 
 sometimes it feels like it was yesterday. 
 Do you know how hard it was 
 to come out to you guys in the first place? 
 And then how painful it was 
 when your reaction was just to kick me out. 
 I was just a kid. 
 I needed my parents. 
 And I crawled back home 
 because I wanted my family back, 
 and you just acted like it never happened. 
 You didn't even apologize! Still! 
 [KNOCK ON DOOR] 
 Hey. 
 Jorge, a suspect was just arrested 
 for beating up a drag queen, and his description 
 matches one of the guys that attacked you. 
 You gotta come to the station 
 tomorrow first thing to I.D. him. 
 - I'm coming with you. 
- No. 
 I'm fine on my own. 
 I know it's unorthodox. 
 But it is still Guy's original design, and we just... 
 we took a few liberties based on what Casey wanted. 
 It was Katy's vision. 
 The hidden underbelly of a dress. 
 Very on theme. 
 I get the significance. 
 And Katy, I think it's... 
 brilliant. 
 But it only fixes half our problem. 
 Guy needs to walk Casey down the red carpet, 
 and he's still nowhere to be found. 
 It's the Meta Gala. He can't just miss it. 
 You don't know my brother. 
 [DOOR BUZZES] 
 Another day, another homophobe, eh? 
 I'm sorry that wasn't our guy, Jorge. 
 Twelve o'clock. 
 [GASPS] No, no, no, no! 
 Why did I put on his sweatshirt again? 
 You look good. 
 [JORGE INHALES] 
 - Bernardo. 
- Hey, Jorge. Was it him? 
 [PAINED GRUNT] No. 
 How are you? 
 Well, our attacker's still on the streets, 
 so, you know, been better. 
 Yeah. I've been better too. 
 Can we go somewhere and talk? 
 [OFFICER] All right, sit down, sir. 
 [GUY] What Zara does to designers is criminal! 
 - [OFFICER] Sir, sit down. 
- [GUY] Put them in handcuffs! 
 Ohh! I cannot feel my legs. 
 It has been a week. 
 And you have done all of the heavy lifting 
 so I could deal with this whole Guy mess. 
 - [PHONE BUZZING] 
- [SIGHS] 
 Hey, Jorge. 
 [JORGE] Katy, girl, you will not believe who's here 
 at the 35th precinct, day-drunk in a turtleneck! 
 Jorge, you are a lifesaver. Thank you! 
 - [PHONE BEEPS] 
- [KATY] I gotta go. 
 I'm sorry, but just call me if you need me. 
 Aaah! Slow your roll! 
 I cannot have you going to the Meta Gala 
 looking like young Cosette. 
 Here. 
 [KATY GASPS] 
 I don't know what to say. 
 Well, just call me your fairy godmother. 
 - Bye! 
- Oh. 
 - Thank you! 
- You're welcome. 
 How's Buzz? 
 I went to the park to surprise you, 
 but you were jogging with him. 
 Thanks. 
 I'm so sorry, Jorge. 
 We hung out a few times, that's it. 
 Whatever. It's... it's fine. 
 - Why do you always do that? 
- What? 
 Pretend like you're not hurt. 
 I think I'm just so scared of being abandoned again, 
 that I... 
 either cling too tight, 
 or self-sabotage. 
 I won't abandon you, Jorge. 
 I want to start fresh. 
 I can't. 
 I can't keep finding ways of hiding from my feelings. 
 I have a lot to work through. 
 And... 
 I think I need to do it alone. 
 Okay. 
 Well... 
 if you ever change your mind... 
 you know where to find me. 
 [KISSES] 
 
 
 
 - [POLICE RADIO CHATTER] 
- [PHONES RINGING] 
 Guy! Oh, thank God. 
 Coffee, egg-and-cheese sandwich. Hangover cure-all. 
 And if we leave right now, we'll have just enough time 
 to get you in your tux and on that red carpet. Let's go! 
 I'm not going to the Meta Gala, Katy. 
 I didn't make Casey Wilson her dress. 
 That's okay, because I... 
 cobbled something together for Casey using your dress. 
 I do not need you to rescue me, Katy. 
 Really? Because you are sitting in the police station 
 on the day of the Meta Gala. 
 And I definitely don't need a lecture from my apprentice. 
 This apprentice saved your ass! 
 Guy, I would do anything to have what you have. 
 I have dreamt of showing my work at the Meta Gala 
 since I could thread a needle. 
 But now, I'll never make it there 
 because I can't even get into Parsons. 
 "Dear Katy Keene, we regret to inform you 
 that you are not good enough". 
 Tell me what it's like to be so successful 
 that you can just shrug your shoulders 
 and you can skip the Meta Gala. 
 That kind of privilege, that must be really nice. 
 [SHAKY BREATH] 
 [EXHALES, SNIFFLES] 
 You know what? Do whatever. 
 I, for one, I refuse to drag you 
 to a gala kicking and screaming. 
 You have got two legs, so you can get yourself there. 
 [ORCHESTRAL MUSIC PLAYING] 
 [TAKES DEEP BREATH] 
 [CASEY] I never knew I could love a dress 
 more than my own children. 
 I'm literally never taking this off. 
 I've gotta tell Guy. 
 Where is Guy? Is he mad at me? 
 No, he is not mad, he's just getting cleaned up. 
 Wanna take a look? 
 - [CAMERA SHUTTERS CLICKING] 
- [CHATTER] 
 Enjoy. Stay hydrated. 
 - What is this Pepper Plant? 
- That's a good question. 
 - Hmm. 
- [PEPPER LAUGHS] 
 No idea who that is. 
 Look out for the Hannah House coming soon to Nolita. 
 Nolita? [LAUGHS] 
 That's quite the soundbite. 
 Quite the role reversal. 
 Suddenly, I'm the star player 
 and you're passing out the Gatorade. 
 How on earth did you snag an invite? 
 One of your contacts, Nina Garcia. 
 She sponsors the event. 
 I was calling on behalf of Busy Philips, 
 who was calling on behalf of Michelle Williams. 
 Well, I am equal parts impressed... 
 and exhausted. What are we doing, Hannah? 
 I don't know about you, but I'm getting sweet revenge. 
 We need to bury the hatchet eventually, 
 or at least go get a drink and chat about it. 
 I guess we could have a drink. 
 You look dashing, by the way. 
 As dashing as the first day I met you. 
 Casey, they're asking for you. 
 We can't stall any longer, 
it's now or never. 
 Wait, I can't walk without Guy. 
 It's as much his moment as it is mine. 
 My brother would want you to have this, with or without him. 
 Okay, fine. Let's... let's break with tradition 
 and just upset the fashion gods. 
 Who's gonna help me with my train? 
 You're up, Katy Keene. 
 Are they gonna like it? 
 Yes. They are going to love it. 
 I cannot wait for everyone to see you. 
 The real you. 
 Thank you. 
 [KATY] Okay. 
 [CASEY] Guy! 
 - What the hell? Your eye! 
- Consider it on theme. 
 - Shall we? 
- Okay. 
 It's a beautiful dress. 
 [MAN] What a lovely gown! 
 [ENTHUSIASTIC CHATTER] 
 [KO] Katy. 
 [GASPS] You're here! 
 Oh! The tux fits. It looks amazing! 
 Yeah, it's perfect. 
Like everything you do. 
 [SCOFFS] 
 Hey, uh, I was an idiot. 
 I'm sorry that I punched Guy. 
 Looks like I gave him a pretty good shiner, too. 
 You're forgiven. 
 But do not ever let that happen again. 
 I won't. 
 - Did you... ? 
- No. 
 That is a Guy LaMontagne original. 
 Come on... 
 that dress has Katy Keene written all over it. 
 Your mom would be so proud of you. 
 - [KATY LAUGHS] Oh, hi. 
- Hi! 
 Um, you ready? 
 Yeah. 
 [MAN, OVER RADIO] There's water everywhere. Bring a mop. 
 [REPORTER] Xandra, we've heard rumors 
 that you're working on an album with a girl group. 
 Is that true? 
 Actually, I am excited to officially announce...

- Go! 
 Guy, a lot of people are saying your dress was one of the stand-outs. 
How do you feel? 
 I feel... 
 grateful and humbled 
 and like I don't deserve all the credit. 
 You know, making a dress like the one Casey wore today, 
 it takes a village. 
 Weeks of intense labor and love. 
 And I couldn't do it without my sister 
 or my team of seamstresses. 
 But... 
 there is one person I do want to single out... 
 and that's my apprentice, Katy Keene. 
 She's the unsung hero of this dress. 
 And, uh, if you don't know her name by now, 
 trust me, 
 you will one day. 
 [REPORTER CLAMORING] 
 [WOMAN] What can you tell me 
 about the exclusive line you... 
 - ♪ You're lookin' good ♪ 
- _ 
 ♪ You're on fire... ♪ 
 Aw, drowning our sorrows? 
 [SIGHS] More like admitting defeat. 
 Sit. 
 Well, you finally bested me. 
 Congrats. 
 You win. 
 Mm! Indulge me, though. 
 How much did you actually raise for your Harpy House? 
 A modest 300K. But who's counting? 
 Ooh! I'm thinking... 
 - St. Lucia. 
- Hmm? 
 Oh, it's where I'm going to holiday 
 with my half of the "modest" 300K. 
 And we are still married. 
 Per usual, you're one step behind. 
 My lawyers have ensured 
 that you will never see a dime of my money. 
 And my lawyer, the Sierra McCoy, 
 has dug up enough dirt on your corrupt lawyers 
 to disbar them for life. 
 When they go down, so do you. 
 The money isn't worth 
 the damage that we'll do to each other 
 if we stay married. 
 Just for the record, 
 it was real... 
 what we had. 
 We don't need to keep hurting each other. 
 Well, it wasn't all bad. 
 - The nights in Morocco... 
- Mm. 
 the bottle of Dom we stole 
 from the now-Duchess of Sussex. 
 [BOTH LAUGH] 
 We had fun. 
 But I will never forgive you. 
 [PEPPER] Well... 
 Take care of yourself, my darling. 
 [FOOTSTEPS APPROACH] 
 Mom? What are you... 
 [GASPS] You called my mother? 
 It was the only way to ensure 
 that you would stop tormenting me for good. 
 Taylor, you are not supposed to be drinking 
 on your medication. 
 I'm taking you back to the country house. 
 Okay. 
 Casey's dress was fierce as hell. 
 Not bad for a gutter girl like yourself, Katy. 
 Seriously, you killed it. 
 - [GLASSES CLINK] 
- Thank you, Amanda. 
 Mm. Why have we always been so competitive? 
 We want different things. 
 You are destined to be the next Gloria Grandbilt. 
 Well, minus the shoulder pads. 
 Can we actually be friends? 
 No. Gross. Don't get carried away. 
 Okay, I'm gonna go to the after-parties with the girls. 
 My way of thanking them for their hard work. 
 - You wanna come? 
- No. 
 I think I'll stay here and clean up. 
 Okay, nerd. 
 Suit yourself.

 Alexander Cabot? 
 Who wants to know? 
 Hannah. Hannah Melvey. 
 I don't have much time. 
 I'm on my way out of town, and my psycho mother 
 thinks I came in here because I find the album Blue soothing. 
 I do. But it's not why I'm here. 
 You mind getting to the point? 
 There's something you need to know about Pepper Smith. 
 [LUISA] Mateo told me it wasn't the same guy. 
 I wish it was. 
 [SIGHS] Me too, Mami. 
 There isn't a day that goes by that I don't think about 
 that year that we kicked you out. 
 I'm your mother, and... 
 I should have protected you. 
 I should have told you then what I can tell you now: 
 whoever you love, however you dress, 
 you are my son, and I accept you completely. 
 [JORGE SIGHS] 
 I just wish Dad felt the same way. 
 He has his own ways of protecting you. 
 He didn't even care if I moved out of the building. 
 That's not true. 
 We had to raise the rent on the other units, 
 but your father couldn't bear the idea 
 of you and your friends leaving, 
 so we've covered your share for the last couple of years. 
 He wants to keep you close. 
 But the truth is, 
 business at the bodega has been slow, 
 and we've been struggling with the mortgage. 
 We can pay more rent. We... 
We'll pay whatever we owe you. 
 No. Your father and I 
 have made a lot of sacrifices 
 so that you kids could follow your dreams. 
 Okay. 
 Then how about you help me run lines 
 for the Hedwig audition you circled? 
 I would love nothing more. 
 - Whoo! [ALL LAUGH] 
- [CLINKING] 
 I cannot believe that we pulled that off. 
 Your friend Pepper is legit. 
 The Pussycats are a trending topic? 
 This feeling... this... 
 is something that Xandra can never take away from us. 
 - Mm-hmm! 
- [GLASSES CLINK] 
 [GIGGLING] 
 - Josie. 
- Hmm? 
 - We need to talk. 
- What is it? 
 Pepper's been lying to all of us. 
 Can I help? 
 What are you doing here? 
 It's your big night. 
 You should be out there celebrating. 
 I tried, but then I realized 
 the only person I want to be celebrating with 
 is... you. 
 You did rescue me tonight, Katy. 
 I'm so sorry you had to. I... 
 put you in a terrible position. 
 Yeah. You did. Look, I get it. 
 I have a fear of rejection, too. 
 And we all cope with things in different ways. 
 I put on a happy face, 
 and... you don't. 
 And that's fine. 
 But the next time you break, 
 I cannot be the one who picks up the pieces. 
 There won't be a next time. 
 I promise. 
 You know, I didn't get into Parsons, either. 
 Seriously? 
 Truth is... 
 it is not the end-all, be-all. 
 Yeah, that's easy for you to say. 
 [CHUCKLES SOFTLY] 
 What is it gonna take... 
 for you to stop doubting yourself, Katy? 
 You're incredibly talented. 
 You're smart, you're... 
 passionate, you're fearless. 
 You have this way... 
 of looking at a person... 
 and bringing out the best in them. 
 And that is not something anyone can teach you. 
 You have an amazing career ahead of you. 
 And, um... 
 And I just hope I have a front row seat.
