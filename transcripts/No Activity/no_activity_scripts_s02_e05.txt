 Car 72, I've got Superintendent Swayne here. 
 I'm just gonna patch you through. Go ahead. 
 Car 72, this is Superintendent Swayne. 
 Let's start with an update on your progress there, car 72. 
 Hello? 
 Are they there? 
 Yeah, should be. 
 I have signal received. Car 72? 
 Car 72? This is Superintendent Swayne. 
 An update on your position there, car 72. 
 Car 72, can you come in, please? 
 Car 7... Car 72. 
 Ah, this is wasting my time. 
 Guys. 
 For f*ck's sake. 
 Stokes : I usually nap, but it was Hendy, he was asleep at the same time, you see? 
 And that's when the superintendent called, so it was pretty unlucky for both of us, yeah. 
 Yeah, code 4 misconduct, they called it. 
 Anyway, it's nice to be in the driver's seat for a change. 
 Hendy, he usually drives. 
 I'm normally where you are, I'm the passenger. 
 Is this... you making some conversation? 
 Yeah. Yeah, I guess so. 
 Yeah, I don't want to. 
 I should tell him! 
 I reckon he'd get a real kick out of this. 
 Uh, car 35, come in. 
 Hendy on radio : This is car 35. Go ahead. 
 Hendy! 
 Hey. 
 Hey, guess what. 
 What? 
 I'm in the driver's seat. 
 You are? 
 Yeah. You know, I'm usually in the passenger side, you know? 
 Hendy : Yeah, yeah. I'm usually driving, hey? 
 (CHUCKLES) Yeah. 
 Hendy : Anything, uh, happening there? 
 Oh, well... no, no, nothing. 
 Nothing going on. 
 You know, we're getting on great guns. 
 This is... Plenty of laughs. 
 All right, mate, we'll, uh... we'll chat soon. 
 All right? Over. 
 'Bye. 
 (APRIL CLEARS THROAT) 
 That was Stokes. 
 Yeah. 
 Bit weird, isn't it? 
 Not... not... not because of you here. Not us, I'm just saying... 
 We're not weird. Unless your dad shows up with his big dick. 
 Sorry. I don't think it's... 
 I don't think it was bigger. It was kind of just the same. 
 I didn't really notice. 
 I'm just saying I'm not that... 
 The point that I'm trying to make is that Stokes isn't here and that's what's weird. 
 Usually it's Stokes. 
 Yeah. I know. 
 You know? But obviously you're here now. That's all. 
 Yep, got it. 
 I'm across it, I know why you were separated. 
 Well, do you, though? 
 Uh-huh. 
 You were both sleeping. 
 Considering I have to be here, do you think maybe we could clear the air about last week and you taking photos of me... 
 Oh, come on! 
 When I was running? 
 I did not take photos of you in your running gear. 
 We've been over this. 
 Yeah, right. 
 And I've apologised for the misunderstanding. 
 Because you had wet shorts. I know. 
 Yes. 
 Yeah, sure. 
 And that'll be the end of it. 
 (SIGHS) 
 Wonder what Stokes is doing. 
 Yeah, better ask him. 
 Car 72, come in. 
 Oh, thank God. 
 Hendy! 
 Quick noughts and crosses? 
 Sure. 
 Uh, top left, nought. 
 Top right, cross. 
 Top middle, nought. 
 Bottom right, cross. 
 Bottom left, nought. I got ya. 
 No, you didn't have anything in the middle left... centre. 
 I didn't need anything in the middle left centre. 
 I had top, middle, bottom in the centre. 
 (WHISPERS) f*ck! 
 Hendy : Okay, do you wanna do I-spy? 
 (SIREN WAILS) 
 (GROANS) 
 You all right? 
 Yeah. 
 I'm a bit dusty. That was... a great night at the roller derby. 
 Yeah, it was a big night. 
 Massive night. Fantastic! 
 Yeah? You liked it? 
 I loved it! 
 The way they, you know, get the crowd involved and all geed up, and it was really close at the end, you just wanted to run on the rink and just bloody... 
 That other jammer on the other team, you just wanted to hip-and-shoulder her and take her down. 
 You know? 
 No, you did. 
 Hey? 
 You did. 
 You shoulder-charged her. 
 Oh, that's why that's all... frozen up. 
 I can't... I can't... Got no... 
 It looked like it hurt, actually. 
 Yeah, that's hurting. Oh, wow! 
 Ah, it's coming back! 
 Okay! (LAUGHS) Crazy! 
 Yeah. No, I thought you'd left, actually. 
 Yeah? Did I... 
 After they took you outside. 
 Yeah, but... 'cause I wanted to go back in to go to the toilet, remember? 
 Yeah, but then you just... went. 
 Oh, I've just gone outside, haven't I? Oh, that's hilarious! 
 I got no control down there, with... 
 You were saying that, actually. 
 "Location is irrelevant! I've had a kid!" 
 (CHUCKLES) Yeah. Hilarious! 
 It was fun. 
 Late night, though. 
 Like, for a weeknight. 4am? 
 I'm pretty sure I was home by midnight, actually. 
 It was definitely 4am when I got home. 
 Weren't you... Were you at the park? 
 And the Samoan security guards came up? 
 You know, it was your idea to climb the tree. 
 I just... I don't think I did climb a tree. 
 I'm pretty sure you did. In fact, I think there's photos to prove it. 
 So I'll... Where's my phone? 
 (SIGHS) Oh, f*ck, I've lost my phone. 
 Ugh. (SIGHS) 
 That's not... Ow. 
 (CRACKING) 
 That's... 
 (CRACKING CONTINUES) 
 Oh, can you hear that? 
 Yep. 
 Ohh. 
 That's wrong. 
 That's not good at all, is it? 
 Oh, that's just... 
 That was worth it, though. That was a great night. 
 Dispatch : Entering phase 3 Alpha 1. 
 We are leaving car 72 in position. 
 Car 35 has been moved to the location. 
 That's a very impressive moustache you have. 
 Yeah. 
 Did... Do you spend much time grooming? 
 Yeah, I don't wanna talk about my moustache. 
 It's just that it's quite, um... 
 It's got a great shape. 
 Looks like... 
 You know Sam Elliott, the cowboy actor? 
 It's a bit like his. 
 Yeah, I don't... I don't watch much television. 
 Well, movies like "Tombstone" and... 
 Don't know him. 
 Do you mind if I, um... if I just touch it? 
 (SIGHS) 
 I mean, I just wanna see how... 
 You wanna touch my moustache? 
 Well, just a... just a bit. 
 All right, I'll tell you what. 
 You can touch my moustache if I can touch your balls. 
 Oh... (LAUGHS) Hey! 
 What? 
 Yeah. 
 You can touch my moustache, gently, if I can unzip your fly, put my hand between your legs and just feel the little furry hairs that grow from your scrotum. 
 Jesus! 
 No, don't... don't worry about it. I don't wanna touch it. 
 Okay. Forget about that? 
 Yeah. 
 Okay. 
 Sorry I mentioned it. 
 The offer is on the table. 
 Man on radio : Bruce and Jimmy are still on the package, boss. 
 Man 2 on radio : I know. I'm working out the next step. 
 Bruce : This is just bullshit! 
 This is getting to the point of being offensive, you know. 
 Mate, I've done all the right... 
 Hung up. 
 Ouch. 
 Ouch is right. 
 Is this the gay nephew thing? 
 Oh, yeah. I mean, mate, you try, you know? 
 He's come out, okay? 
 Yeah. 
 Brave. Good kid, you know? 
 Family's freaking out about it, you know? 
 You're okay with that? 
 Totally okay. 
 I'm celebrating this kid! 
 You used to really hate on the gays. 
 I did. 
 You used to be real... 
 You were really anti-homosexual when, you know, a couple of years ago... 
 Remember those? 
 I do. I do. 
 And I take full responsibility for that. Those days are over, mate. 
 Remember Darren and Steven? 
 Oh, at the cafe? 
 What a wonderful couple. 
 Weren't they beautiful? 
 I mean, so, so well mannered. 
 Always polite, always... Always leave a tip. Always drop a tip. 
 Good tippers, yeah, yeah. 
 They were classy blokes. I mean, Stevie, mate! 
 I used to sit there with Stevie, he'd say, "Oh, you're a rough-headed," you know, "boofhead." 
 And I'd say, "Oh, you big faggot!" 
 You know, we'd laugh, mate! 
 Yeah. 
 You know, it was a joke for us. 
 We understood each other. It was no problem. 
 I mean, he really... I jumped the fence once I met Stevie. 
 Yeah, you sure did. 
 You know? 
 So after meeting them, I thought, "Okay, the kid's come out." 
 So what I do? I go buy the one thing that I know gays are gonna love. 
 Hair straightener. 
 Oh, yeah? 
 Yeah. 
 That's... that's a gay thing, is it? 
 Oh, mate, you need to get out and about, find out what's going on. 
 I bought a few gay mags, you know, on the side. 
 Did ya? 
 Yeah, mate, you know. 
 I just wanted to do the homework for the kid, you know? 
 And hair straighteners, I see 'em left, right and centre. 
 So I buy him this top-shelf hair straightener, mate. 
 Had to get this thing imported, right? 
 I buy him all the adaptors for round the world, 'cause I know them fellas, they like to travel. 
 Drop it off to the birthday party. 
 I'm feeling proud and loud myself. I'm feeling great about this. 
 Roxy, she starts abusing me in the back room, in front of the kid, which was even more embarrassing, you know? 
 "Oh, you're a homophobe. You're making the boy feel bad." 
 Because I bought him a hair straightener? 
 I bought him a hair straightener because gays love straighteners! 
 You know what's happened here? You know what Roxy thinks? 
 That you've bought the hair straighteners 'cause you want him to be straight. 
 That it's not about the curl in his hair or the wave of this or that, but it's about... subconscious homophobia. 
 But I'm not. 
 I know you're not. I know you're not. 
 I'm not. I'm not. 
 I know you're not. 
 I know you're not. 
 But maybe you are. 
 Just a little bit. 
 Maybe I am, a bit... still. 
 Nah, but you're getting there. 
 And you like your nephew. Baby steps. 
 It's baby steps. 
 Yep. A step at a time. 
 Maybe you should return 'em and, um... see if you can get him some hair gel or something. 
 Yeah. 
 Gays love hair gel. 
 Yeah. 
 They love it. 
 Stokes : Car 35? Come in, Car 35. 
 Hendy : Car 35. Hey. 
 What are you doing? 
 Nothing. Rainer's asleep. 
 Is he asleep now? 
 Sound asleep! 
 He's worse than you! 
 Yeah, he's much worse than me. 
 He never wakes up! 
 How old is he? 
 Oh, I don't know. 
 He hasn't submitted to carbon-dating yet. (LAUGHS) 
 We're not on a stake-out. We're in an episode of "Antique Roadshow". 
 (LAUGHS) 
 Love that one. 
 It's a good one. 
 You got any more? 
 You know how 135 years ago Ned Kelly was arrested? 
 Yeah? 
 Yeah. 
 Well, guess who the arresting officer was. 
 Who? 
 Rainer. 
 (LAUGHS) That's a good one, wasn't it? 
 'Cause he... That makes him a hund... 
 
 
 
 (WHISPERS) His eyes are open. 
 Hendy : Now? 
 He's looking right at me. 
 Hendy : Maybe he sleeps with his eyes open. 
 Maybe. He's not moving. 
 Hendy : I tell you what, just move your finger from left to right to see if he follows it with his eyes. 
 If he does, he's awake. 
 No response. 
 Hendy : Ask him if he's awake. 
 Are you awake? 
 Yeah. 
 Yeah, he's awake. 
 Car 35 out. 
 Out. 
 Sorry. 
 Just having a joke. 
 Hendy and I, we often just joke about stuff. 
 Do you know any jokes? 
 Oh, f*ck off. 
 Man : Car 35 is continuing surveillance outside Foxtrot location. 
 Yeah. Sounds yummy. 
 You done? 
 Yeah. No, you leave it there. I'll wash it up. 
 Yeah, okay. You go back to sleep. 
 (CHUCKLES) Love you too. 
 See you soon. 'Bye. 
 It's... it's Gwen, my girlfriend. 
 Oh, yeah? 
 Yep. Living with her. 
 Are ya? 
 Pretty serious, yeah. 
 Wow. 
 She's an ultra-marathon runner. 
 What's an ultra-marathon? 
 Um, I think it's, like, 96 kilometres, or miles... 
 Wow! 
 It's ages. 
 She's incredibly fit. And I'm gonna ask her to marry me. 
 (SIGHS) That's amazing. 
 She's... she's a good fit. 
 That's good. It's a fit fit. 
 It's good to be fit. 
 Yeah. 
 Every second person's got diabetes or is on the obese spectrum. 
 There was a, um, girl at my high school called Tegan. 
 Fat Tegan. She was massive. Like, she was a big girl. 
 Really fat. 
 You called her "Fat Tegan"? 
 Behind her back. But she was more than just fat, she was pathetic. 
 And she was unfocused and she was unhappy and constantly fighting with her mum. 
 I mean, when her mum was even there. 
 Her mum was an alcoholic and f*cking out all the time. 
 But at lunchtime, me and some of the other kind of skinny, cool girls, we'd grab her lunch box every lunchtime and count the calories. 
 Anything over 200, we threw in the bin and made a bit of a spectacle of her. 
 She cried herself to sleep every night and it was really hard for her, but now she's a tight size 8. 
 And I did that. 
 So you're welcome. 
 Hmm. 
 Were you Tegan? 
 No. I'm April. Tegan was Tegan. 
 I was one of the hot girls. 
 Yeah, it just sounds like... you know a lot of details about her, which... 
 But I do. Everyone... 
 About her mum and their relationship and everything. 
 Everyone knew all of that. 
 Right. 
 But you said she cried herself to sleep every night. 
 Okay, can we just drop it? Why do you have to... 
 Like, Tegan isn't Tegan anymore. 
 Tegan actually died a few years ago. 
 So can you drop it? 
 Okay. 
 Okay? 
 Sorry. 
 Yep. (CLEARS THROAT SOFTLY) 
 Even the fact that you're saying that she died makes me think that, you know, it's still... you were Tegan. 
 That she died, metaphorically, then April was born. 
 Just shut up! 
 f*ck! 
 Man : Negative on the City West. 
 Looping back round via Broadway. Out. 
 (LAUGHS) 
 Look at old Squirrelly! Look at old Squirrel, eh? 
 (LAUGHS) He looks about 300! 
 I'm off the Instagram. I'm sick of it. 
 I'm off the Facebook. 
 I'm not gonna tweet anymore. 
 No more Snapchats. 
 No more social media. 
 You know, ever since we lost the café, I'm just... 
 I'm not following "Beyons" and Taylor Swift anymore. 
 I'm sick of seeing their successes, their dreams achieved. 
 I love Tay Tay. 
 I love her. And look what Beyoncé's done. 
 Look what Beyoncé's done, mate! 
 She turned bloody lemons into "Lemonade", getting stuck into Jay Z over all that sh1t. 
 Fantastic, mate. 
 Well, where's our "Lemonade"? 
 We had our "Lemonade". We spilled it everywhere. 
 Nah, mate, we're still bubbling, mate. Still bubbling. 
 Still making bubbles, baby. 
 Yeah, sometimes I feel... really proud to be alive in the same time as "Beyons". 
 Know what I'm saying? 
 Yeah. 
 Sometimes a bit jealous, but... mostly just really proud. 
 Me too, mate. Me too. 
 (PHONE KEYBOARD CLICKS) 
 Yeah, look, if you're gonna check your matches on Kindle every two minutes, do you mind putting it on silent? 
 No, it's not... This is Tinder. 
 Same thing. 
 No, it's not. It's not the same thing. 
 I mean, one's a dating app, the other one's a... book reading thing. 
 Anyway, I'm on the line to Betty. 
 Well, trying to get hold of her. She's been a bit non-responsive. 
 And she did a no-show at our first date, so... 
 (CLICKS TONGUE) hoping for better things. 
 I'm on the verge of dropping her, 'cause... we don't need 'em, do we? 
 You know? 
 We don't. 
 Ow! Oh. (LAUGHS) 
 Oh, that's tender. 
 What? 
 Oh, my hip. 
 Yeah? 
 Yeah, got a bit of a twinge right down there in the groiny, almost. 
 I was taking the bins out last week, just, you know, out the front and down the thing, and I tripped over and I hurt my hip. 
 (CHUCKLES) It's odd. 
 Sounds like you had a fall. 
 No! It wasn't a fall. 
 It was just a... just... 
 You know, a little trip. 
 Ever happened before? 
 Yeah. 
 Yeah, but ever so completely without any rhyme or reason? 
 For no explanation other than your body buckled under years of strain and decay? 
 Ouff! No. 
 I remember my first fall. I was about your age at the time. 
 No, it wasn't a fall... 
 Split-level house. Just missed the one step. 
 I'm years off having a fall, though. 
 I mean, I'm at least 20... 30 years off having a fall. 
 I don't fall. 
 And this happened last Sunday? Yeah? 
 Yeah. 
 And you're still wincing? 
 Well, you know, it's getting better. 
 Ooh, that is with you for the rest of your life. 
 No. No. 
 Till you're dead. Yep! 
 You had a fall. 
 I didn't have a fall. 
 Welcome to the club. 
 I'm not in that club. 
 I'm in a club that goes mountaineering with young backpackers. 
 We are elderly men. 
 We have falls. 
 You had a fall. 
 Ohh. 
 I had my first fall. 
 Hey. 
 Oh, f*ck it. 
 It's okay. It gets easier. 
 I had one this morning. 
 Haven't even thought about it. 
 Woman : No movement. Reports all clear from the south. Over. 
 Car 35, please report. 
 Car 35. No activity. 
 Hey, g'day, April. How are you? 
 Good, thanks, Carol. You? 
 Oh, a bit dusty, actually. Bit of a big night last night. 
 April : Hope you're all right. 
 Yeah, went out with Anousha, my new partner in Dispatch. 
 Great! That sounds fun. 
 Yeah. And fun fact, Anousha's actually Muslim. 
 Oh, okay. That's good. 
 Do you have any Muslim friends, April? 
 Um, I don't think so. 
 Should probably look into that. 
 It's a very diverse country we live in. 
 April : Yeah, sure. 
 Actually, I better go. It's time for our tea break. 
 We do a bit of a, like, little tea ritual. 
 April : That sounds lovely. 
 Okay. See ya, April. 
 Okay, see ya! 
 (SWITCHES MIC OFF) 
 Oh, God, she sounds miserable. 
 Do you think? 
 Oh, yeah. 
 She sounded a bit jealous, which is weird, maybe jealous of us, I don't know. 
 Anyway, should... should we have a cup of tea? 
 Yeah. 
 We could... 
 A tea thing. 
 You'll have to get the cups down. 
 That's still... dead. 
 Yeah, all right. 
 (MOUTHS SILENTLY) 
 (INDISTINCT RADIO CHATTER) 
 Woman : Check the East-West on the way through. 
 Man : Copy. Circling East-West. 
 Stokes : The most annoying thing happened today when I was waiting at the station. 
 Am I supposed to prompt you now? 
 Yeah, if you... if you want. 
 Okay. 
 What happened? 
 Well, thanks for asking. 
 So I'm waiting at the bus stop, all right? 
 You know, I often like to catch the bus 'cause it gives me a bit of a thrill, a bit of a buzz. 
 I often put my badge on the outside to, uh... give the punters a bit of a buzz as well. 
 They like to see the force moving amongst them. 
 Okay. Great story. 
 No, there's more. 
 Is there? 
 Yeah. That was just the set-up. 
 That was just... just whetting your appetite for more. 
 So I'm at the bus stop, okay, you know, waiting for a bus. 
 And it was clear, obvious, I was waiting, 'cause I'm just standing there, waiting, and... and a million buses go by. 
 (SIGHS) 
 You know, some of them were full and others could have been expresses, but... it's just so annoying. 
 Oh, so that's it? That's... 
 That's the whole story? 
 Yeah, pretty much. 
 I mean, I moved through the middle bit a bit quick just because I could see that you weren't enjoying it as much. 
 I was just reading my audience there. 
 Yeah, I don't know why I'm engaged with this, but, you know, a million buses didn't go by. 
 Well... 
 You know, maybe not a million. 
 I was just exaggerating that bit for... for the effect of the story. 
 Yeah, but it ruins the story. 
 Oh, I don't know. 
 I think storytelling is a fine art, and the power of exaggeration is one of the tools of the storyteller. 
 No, no, it renders the story meaningless because no one has ever experienced that. 
 A million buses gone by? I don't even know what that would be like! 
 How many buses actually went by? 
 Three. 
 Three. Three buses. 
 Four? 
 Okay, let's keep it at three. 
 Three buses went by. That I understand. 
 Now I'm on your side. I can imagine what that would be like, okay? 
 First bus goes by, and you are like, "m*therf*cker!" 
 Yeah! It's frustrating. 
 Boy, is it! 
 When you're waiting. 
 Yeah! Then the second bus goes by. 
 And you're, like, "Oh, f*ck!" 
 "f*ck me! What the f*ck is going on?!" 
 Yes. I didn't use that language, but I see where you're going. 
 Then the third bus goes by. Ooh, the third. 
 And you are like, "f*ck my sh1t!" 
 Ahh... 
 "f*ck my f*cking sh1t!" 
 (LAUGHS AWKWARDLY) 
 "Right, that's it, I am ringing the motherfucking bus company. Come on! Yeah, pick up! Come on, you pick up! Hello? (SCREAMS) Don't put me on hold!" 
 "Don't you put me on hold, you motherfucks! You're f*cked!" 
 See, I can imagine what that is like. 
 You know, you've replaced hyperbole for actual detail, so now you've engaged me. 
 Now I'm feeling annoyed. 
 I feel all that, the frustration, the anger, the annoyance. 
 I'm feeling very, very, very, very, very annoyed. 
 (BREATHES DEEPLY) 
 All right. 
 That's so good, about you and Gwen. 
 Oh, yeah, thank you. Yeah, yeah, yeah. 
 Just wanted to say that. 
 It's cool. 
 Yeah, feels good. Good decision, you know? Feels strong. 
 I'm part of her support crew. 
 Totally. 
 I mean, we had a little spark, but... I mean, we obviously just didn't take off. 
 And you've found that, though, with somebody else, and that's great. 
 You thought we had a spark? 
 Yeah. Didn't you? 
 Yeah, I did. 
 Yeah. 
 Just, like, a little one. 
 A little one. Totally. 
 But it's, like... It's so good that you're gonna marry Gwen. 
 That's really cool. 
 Oh, yeah. 
 Yeah. 
 Yeah, it's definitely good. 
 Oh, it's the best. Definitely. I mean, I haven't asked her yet. 
 Oh, you... Oh, yeah, sure. 
 No, no. But everything's good. 
 It's good, yeah. 
 April : Mmm. 
 It's funny, when I saw your name on the roster list, I was, like, "Oh, yeah, April." 
 Wow, yeah. 
 April Mayhew. 
 My heart definitely skipped a little beat when I saw your name there too. 
 Really? 
 (BOTH MOAN) 
 We shouldn't do this. We shouldn't do it at work. 
 No. Mmm! 
 That's a real shame, Betty. 
 We really could've been something. 
 (SCOFFS) 
 sh1t! 
 (SIGHS) 
 Uh, car 35? Car 35, Hendy, come in. Come in, Hendy. 
 Hendy : Not now, not now. Over. 
 No, this... this one's important. 
 Hendy : Negative. Shut up, go away. Over and out. 
 Hendy. Car 35... 
 Car 35, come in. 
 I've been wanting to do this for so long. 
 Since you saw my arse at the beach? 
 I didn't see your arse at the beach! 
 Since you were looking at my... 
 (BOTH MOAN) 
 No, I didn't. Okay, maybe I did. Maybe I did. 
 Since you took a photo of it? 
 I didn't take a photo! I didn't take a photo. 
 Oh, maybe one. 
 Just one? 
 Oh, just the one. 
 Just one? 
 Just one. Just one! 
 You took one photo. 
 Yeah, I did. 
 I'm good. 
 You're Fat Tegan! 
 Yes. Yep. 
 Rainer? Rainer? 
 Rai... Oh, sh1t! 
 Car 35, Hendy? 
 Uh, Hendy, this is Stokes. Come in, Hendy. 
 Hendy, we have an emergency here! Rainer! 
 (LAUGHS ANXIOUSLY) 
 Come on, old man, wake up! 
 Oh, sh1t, I need some air. 
 (SIGHS) 
 (COUGHS) 
 Oh. f*ck! 
 Help!
