 [OPENING CREDITS] 
 
[INT. GREAT HALL - DAY] Cora : We can put the presents in the drawing room against the window. Mrs Hughes : Very good, milady. [Mrs Hughes leaves to take care of it.] Isobel : I suppose we do have to display all the presents. It can look rather greedy. Lavinia : I can't bear the disruption we seem to have brought down on your heads. Cora : Don't be silly. [Matthew enters and Mary and Lavinia go to him.] Lady Mary : How are you feeling? Matthew : Just wish I could get rid of this damn stick. Sorry. Lady Mary : Don't be. If anyone has a right to swear, it's you. Cora : Don't bully yourself. Think of where we were a few months ago and smile. Lady Mary : I quite agree. Matthew : I want to make it up and down that isle without assistance. Lavinia : Up, yes. You'll have me to lean on when you're coming down. Lady Mary : And you still have three full days of practice, so never say die. Isobel : My goodness, is that the time? I must be getting back. Lavinia : I'll go with you. Matthew : She's just sucking up, Mother. Lavinia : Any bride who doesn't suck up to her husband's mother is a fool. [Isobel chuckles and they exit arm in arm. Matthew smiles after them.] Mrs Hughes : Can I bother you? Mrs Bryant has written a letter I did not expect. [Mrs Hughes hands it to Mr Carson.] Mrs Hughes : She says her husband wants to see the baby. They both do. Mr Carson : Isn't that what you hoped? Mrs Hughes : Yes and no. Remember what he was like the last time. I don't want to build up Ethel's hopes again. Mr Carson : Ethel's not important. It's the boy's chances you have to look to. Mrs Hughes : I believe you're right, though we come at it by different routes. Lady Mary : But why announce it tonight all of a sudden? Lady Sybil : He's got a job at a newspaper. He heard today it's a real chance. Lady Mary : Let him go to Dublin and then you can use the calm to consider. [Sybil scoffs.] Lady Edith : Mary doesn't want you to be trapped before you're completely sure. Lady Sybil : But I am sure! How many times do I have to say it? Anna, tell them. Anna : Lady Mary's right. It's a very big thing to give up your whole world. Lady Mary : Thank you. Listen to her if you won't listen to me. Lady Sybil : But I'm not giving up my world! They want to give me up. That's their affair. I'm perfectly happy to carry on being friends with everyone. Lady Mary : Married to the chauffeur? Lady Sybil : Yes. Anyway, he's a journalist now, which sounds better for Granny. [Sybil sits down on the bed, frustrated.] Lady Sybil : We're going to tell Papa tonight. [They all stare at her.] Lady Edith : "We"? You mean, you and Branson? Lady Sybil : He's coming in after dinner. Lady Edith : But what will Papa do? Lady Mary : I imagine he'll call the police. [Sybil sniffs and shakes her head.] Mr Carson : Downton is not a hostel. Thomas : No, Mr Carson. Mr Carson : And you made such a point of not being a servant anymore, our ears are ringing with it. Thomas : The trouble is, I'm a little out of pocket at the moment. Mr Carson : I cannot say that I 'm sympathetic, when you dabble in the black market. Thomas : I just need some more time, Mr Carson. Mr Carson : How long is it since the last patient left, Sergeant? You're trespassing on our generosity. Thomas : I'll try to make myself useful. Mr Carson : Just find somewhere to go. [Thomas leaves in shock.] Robert : Yes? [Edith tenses in anticipation. Branson looks at Sybil.] Branson : I'm here. [Sybil gets up and walks over to Branson.] Lady Sybil : I don't think this is such a good idea. We mustn't worry Granny. Branson : You've asked me to come, and I've come. Violet : Would someone please tell me what is going on, or have we all stepped through the looking glass? Branson : Your grandmother has as much right to know as anybody else. Violet : Why don't I find that reassuring? Mrs Patmore : Ooh, how much longer is Mr Carson going to be? This is why it's never worth trying to make food interesting in the servants' hall. You're very quiet this evening. Daisy Mason : I've had a letter of Mr Mason, William's dad. Mrs Patmore : Oh, yes? What does he want? Daisy Mason : To see me. Mrs Patmore : Oh, there's nothing very wonderful in that. You're his daughter-in-law, why shouldn't he see you? Daisy Mason : I wish it were as simple. Mrs Patmore : Well, I think it is, but I'll not reopen the wound. Robert : What do you mean, "you knew"? Lady Mary : I hoped it would blow over. I didn't want to split the family when Sybil might still wake up. Robert : And all the time, you've been driving me about, bowing and scraping and seducing my daughter behind my back? Branson : I don't bow and scrape! And I've not seduced anyone! Give your daughter some credit for knowing her own mind! Robert : How dare you speak to me in that tone. You will leave at once. Lady Sybil : Oh, Papa! Robert : This is a folly! A ridiculous, juvenile madness! [Violet holds up her hand.] Violet : Sybil, what do you have in mind? Robert : Mama, this is hardly— [Violet holds up her hand.] Violet : No. She must have something in mind. Otherwise, she wouldn't have summoned him here tonight. Lady Sybil : Thank you, Granny. Yes, we do have a plan. Tom's got a job on a paper. I'll stay until after the wedding; I don't want to steal their thunder. [Sybil indicates Mary and Lavinia.] Lady Sybil : But after that, I'll go to Dublin. Cora : To live with him? Unmarried? Lady Sybil : I'll live with his mother while the bans are read. And then we'll be married... [Sybil and Branson gaze into each other's eyes.] Lady Sybil : And I'll get a job as a nurse. Violet : What does your mother make of this? Branson : If you must know, she thinks we're very foolish. Violet : (chuckles) So at least we have something in common. [Robert, who has been facing the wall, whips around and storms into the centre of the room.] Robert : I won't allow it! I will not allow my daughter to throw away her life! Lady Sybil : You can posture it all you like, Papa, it won't make any difference! Robert : Oh, yes, it will. Lady Sybil : How? I don't want any money and you can hardly lock me up until I die! I'll say goodnight. But I can promise you one thing, tomorrow morning nothing will have changed. Tom. [Sybil gives him a look to follow her out, leaving the rest of them in a state of shock.] Ethel : He's not coming here. [Ethel folds up Mr Bryant's note.] Ethel : I don't want him to see this place. I won't have him pity me. Mrs Hughes : The question is, are you prepared to let them into Charlie's life? Ethel : I suppose so, yes. Mrs Hughes : Good. I'll ask them to Downton for Monday at four. And this time, it'll be all above board. O'Brien : Can't have expected to live here free forever. Thomas : I didn't expect to get booted out. O'Brien : You'll have to find some work. Thomas : It's not that easy. Every Tom, Dick, and Harry's looking for work these days and they don't all have a hand like a Jules Verne experiment. [Branson enters.] Anna : Mr Branson, I know it wasn't easy last night. Branson : We should've spoken out long ago. Daisy Mason : Spoken out about what? Branson : Oh, why not? Lady Sybil and I are getting married. [Carson enters and the servants stand.] Mr Carson : Have you no shame? Branson : I'm sorry you feel like that, Mr Carson. You're a good man. But no, I have no shame. In fact, I have great pride in the love of that young woman and I will strive to be worthy of it. Mr Carson : I will not disgrace myself by discussing the topic, and nor will anyone else. Now, if you will go, Mr Branson, we will continue with our day. Leave an address where we may forward what is owing to you. Branson : No problem there, Mr Carson. I'll be at the Grantham Arms in the village until Lady Sybil is ready to make her departure. I bid you all a good day. Jane : Is it really true--? Mr Carson : Please. I have asked for silence and silence I will have. Violet : What on earth is it? Lavinia : A gramophone. Some cousins of mine have given it to us. Violet : I should stand well clear when you light blue touchpaper. Violet : All on your own? Lady Edith : I've left space at the front for jewels. I know Lavinia's getting something from Papa. Violet : And from me. Though she's so slight, a real necklace would flatten her. [Edith and Violet chuckle.] Violet : What news of Sybil? Lady Edith : Papa is with her now. Violet : I'm afraid it'll end in tears. Lady Edith : Maybe. But they won't be Sybil's. Violet : I used to think that Mary's beau was a misalliance, but compared to this, he's practically a Hapsburg. [Edith smiles for a moment.] Violet : Oh, don't worry. Your turn will come. Lady Edith : Will it? Or am I just to be the maiden aunt? Isn't this what they do? Arrange presents for their pretty relations? Violet : Don't be defeatist, dear, it's very middle class. Now, I better go up and support your father. Lady Sybil : Your threats are hollow, don't you see? "I won't be received in London. I won't be welcome at court." How do I make you understand? I couldn't care less. [Robert is about to reply when Violet knocks and enters.] Violet : I do hope I'm interrupting something. Robert : I only wish you were, but I seem to be getting nowhere. Have you seen Cora? Violet : Ah-ha. She's lying down, and can we blame her? Now, Sybil, dear, this sort of thing is all very well in novels, but in reality, it can prove very uncomfortable. And while I am sure Branson has many virtues… [Robert is about to protest.] Violet : Well, no, no. He's a good driver. Lady Sybil : I will not give him up! Robert : Don't be rude to your grandmother. Violet : No, she's not being rude, just wrong. Lady Sybil : This is my offer: I will stay one week to avoid the impression I've run away, and because I don't want to spoil Matthew's wedding. And then we will marry in Dublin and whoever wishes to visit will be very welcome. Robert : Out of the question. Lady Sybil : Will you forbid Mary and Edith? Violet : No, don't, don't. Don't say anything you may have to retract. Robert : Know this: there will be no more money. From here on in, your life will be very different. Lady Sybil : Well, bully for that. Mrs Hughes : I thought this might [?] you off-- [Mr Carson tries to rise as she enters, but he's obviously not well.] Mrs Hughes : Mr Carson, whatever's the matter? Mr Carson : Oh, I 'm sure I'll be all right if I can just stay still for a moment. [Mr Carson sinks back into his chair and Mrs Hughes puts down the tray.] Mrs Hughes : You will not stay still, not down here. Get to bed this minute. I'll send for the doctor. Mr Carson : I can't. We've got the Crawleys tonight and Miss Swire. What with this business of Lady Sybil. Mrs Hughes : I'll deal with it. [She helps him up.] Mr Carson : Get Mr Molesley to help. Mrs Hughes : There's no need. Mr Carson : I mean it. The war is no longer an excuse for sloppy presentation. Mrs Hughes : Oh, very well, I'll ask him, but only on condition you go to bed. [Mrs Hughes helps Carson to his room.] O'Brien : Are you too hot in that, my lady? We still have time to change. Cora : No, I'm fine. Thank you. [O'Brien leaves and Cora sinks into a chair.] Cora : So, what do we do next? Robert : God knows. This is what comes of spoiling her. The mad clothes, the nursing. What were we thinking of? Cora : That's not fair. She's a wonderful nurse and she's worked very hard. Robert : But in the process, she's forgotten who she is. Cora : Has she, Robert? Or have we overlooked who she really is? Robert : If you're turning American on me, I'll go downstairs. [Cora sighs and Robert leaves.] Anna : Mr Carson likes to serve two white wines, which you should open and decant just before they eat. A light one for the hors d'oeuvres, then a heavy one with the soup. Keep that going for the fish, and then change to the Claret, which you should really decant now. There's a pudding wine, and after that whatever they want in the drawing room with their coffee. Mr Molesley : Blimey, it's a wonder they make it up the stairs. Anna : They don't drink much of any of it. Now, let me show you the decanters. These four... Cora : So I don't have to receive that terrible man again. Mrs Hughes : It won't be necessary. They'll meet Ethel here, but the-- [Cora stops to lean on the banister.] Mrs Hughes : Should you be downstairs, milady? Cora : Oh, I'm perfectly all right, thank you. [Cora continues down the stairs.] Thomas : Why Molesley? I could've done it. Mrs Patmore : But you always make a mountain out of not being a servant. Thomas : I'm just trying to be helpful. Mrs Patmore : I'm afraid "being helpful" is not something we associate you with. [Thomas walks off.] Mrs Patmore : Ooh, it's wonderful what fear can do to the human spirit. Anna : You quite right, Mr Molesley? Mr Molesley : Yes, I just want to be absolutely sure that this is the lighter wine. [Molesley pours himself a glass.] Jane : What does it matter as long as it's white. Mr Molesley : No. I believe in starting the way you mean to go on. Don't want to get off on the wrong foot. Violet : I'm glad you're here, Sybil, dear. I was afraid you'd have a tray in your room. Robert : Maybe you should have done. Lady Sybil : Why? I'm nor eloping like a thief in the night. I might have once, but Mary and Edith talked me out of it. [Mary and Edith stare at her for outing them.] Violet : Oh? The plot thickens. Isobel : After all, Sybil's had enough time to think about it-- Matthew : Mother, it is not for us to have an opinion. [Molesley falters in pouring Matthew's wine.] Matthew : Mr Molesley, are you quite well? Mr Molesley : I--I'm all right, thank you, sir. Matthew : I don't believe you are. Cora : The awful truth is, I'm not quite all right and I'm afraid I'm going to ask you to excuse me. Robert : I'm so sorry. [The men stand as Cora gets up from the table.] Robert : Would you like us to call Dr Clarkson? Cora : No, no, darling, it's too late. Anna : He's coming anyway, Your Lordship, for Mr Carson. Lady Edith : I-- I'll bring him up when he arrives. Robert : I can sleep in my dressing room. Anna : Oh. I'm glad I've got you. Mr Bates : Aren't you serving? Anna : They're on the main course, so I can spare a moment. I've been thinking and, erm, I have to say something that you won't agree with. We're going to get married. Mr Bates : Don't be silly. We can't. Not now. Anna : You're not listening. You're going to Ripon tomorrow afternoon to take out a special license - I don't care how much it costs - and fix a day. We'll tell no one, but this you will do. Mr Bates : I can't. Anna : Aren't I as strong as Lady Sybil? Mr Bates : I don't doubt that. Anna : Well, then. If she can do it, so can we. That's what I've been thinking. I have stuck by you through thick and thin. Mr Bates : Thin and thin, more like. Anna : Mr Bates, if we have to face this, then we will face it as husband and wife. I will not be moved to the sidelines to watch how you fair from a distance with no right even to be kept informed. I will be your next of kin, and you cannot deny me that. Jane : Anna! You better come, quick. [Anna goes with Jane.] Anna : Mr Molesley? What's happened? Haven't you taken that in yet? Mr Molesley : I'm not well. I'm not well at all. Jane : First Mr Carson, then Her Ladyship, and now him. Anna : Help him down to the servants' hall. The doctor can take a look at him, too, when he gets here. [Anna grabs the decanter and enters the dining room.] Robert : The Spanish flu has found its way to Yorkshire. Isobel : And to Downton. Dr Clarkson says he's got ten cases already. [Anna pours Violet's drink.] Robert : Ah, I thought Molesley had joined the temperance league. Anna : I'm afraid he's been taken ill, milord. I am sorry. Robert : Molesley, too? Good heavens, everyone's falling like ninepins. [Lavinia swoons in her chair.] Lady Mary : Lavinia? Lavinia : Do you know, I'm not at all well either. I wonder if I could lay down for a minute? Lady Mary : Of course. Come to my room. They'll have lit the fire by now. [Mary and Lavinia get up from the table. The men stand as they exit.] Lavinia : Excuse me. Isobel : Do you think we should take her home? Matthew : No, let her rest for a moment. Isobel : Well, I—-I think I should go and help. [Isobel gets up and exits.] Violet : Wasn't there a masked ball in Paris when cholera broke out? Half the guests were dead before they left the ballroom. Robert : Thank you, Mama. That's cheered us up no end. Mrs Hughes : I'll take you to Mr Carson now, and then to see Mr Molesley in the servants' hall. [Robert turns the corner.] Robert : Dr Clarkson, you're kind to come. How is she? Dr Clarkson : Not too bad, I see. But she'll need some nursing for a day or two. Robert : Oh, don't worry about that. All our daughters are professionals. Let's leave her to get some rest. [Mary and Isobel approach.] Lady Mary : Miss Swire may be another victim, but she's sleeping now, so I don't want to disturb her. Dr Clarkson : When she wakes, give her some aspirin and cinnamon in milk and keep her here. I'll look at her in the morning. I better go to Carson. Isobel : I'll come, too. [Clarkson takes a breath and rolls his eyes, but follows Mrs Hughes without a word.] Lady Mary : Where is everyone? Matthew : I'm not sure. Cousin Violet's gone home. Lady Mary : What about you? Matthew : I'm waiting for Lavinia and Mother. Lady Mary : Dr Clarkson wants Lavinia to stay here. He'll see her tomorrow. [Mary listens to the music.] Lady Mary : I don't know this one. Matthew : Actually, I rather like it. I think it was in a show that flopped. Zip Goes a Million, or something. [Mary lets out an amused sigh. Matthew holds out his hands to dance with her. She steps into his arms.] Lady Mary : Can you manage without your stick? Matthew : You are my stick. Lady Mary : Hm. We were a show that flopped. Matthew : Oh, God, Mary. [The music fades and transitions into the modern Downton Abbey orchestral score.] Matthew : I am so, so sorry. Do you know how sorry I am? Lady Mary : Don't be. It wasn't anyone's fault. If it was, it was mine. Matthew : You know, Cousin Violet came to me and told me to marry you. Lady Mary : When was this? Matthew : A while ago. When we knew I would walk again. Lady Mary : Classic Granny. What did you say? Matthew : That I couldn't accept Lavinia's sacrifice of her life, her children, her future, and then give her the brush off when I was well again. Well, I couldn't, could I? Lady Mary : Of course not. Matthew : However much I might want to. Lady Mary : Absolutely not. [Mary and Matthew kiss.] Lavinia : Hello. [Lavinia comes down the stairs and Mary and Matthew part.] Matthew : What are you doing up? Lavinia : Shouldn't we be getting back? Lady Mary : It's decided. You're staying here. Dr Clarkson's coming in the morning so he can treat all of you together. You can borrow some things until Matthew brings you what you need. I'll go and organize a room. [Mary leaves and Matthew walks up to Lavinia.] Matthew : How do you feel? Lavinia : Like a nuisance. Matthew : You could never be that. Lavinia : I mean it, Matthew. Don't ever let me be a nuisance. Don't ever let me get in the way, please. [The gramophone scratches at the end of the song.] O'Brien : I'll sleep on a chair in her room. Dr Clarkson : Oh, no. There's no need for that. O'Brien : I don't mind. [Molesley pulls his head off the table groggily.] Mr Molesley : What is it? O'Brien : I'd like to be on hand. Mrs Hughes : So, we're quite the hospital again. Dr Clarkson : You'll probably gain some more patients over the next few day-- [Clarkson leans in as he's checking Molesley and sniffs his hair. He smiles as Molesley continues to snore at the table.] Dr Clarkson : But you don't need to worry about Molesley. He'll be fine in the morning. Mrs Hughes : Oh? Dr Clarkson : Uh-huh. The others have Spanish flu. He's just drunk. Jane : Oh, did you want Mr Bates, milord? Robert : I forgot to say I want to be woken early. Jane : Well, I can tell him that. [Robert nods and starts to go back to his room.] Jane : Freddy got in to Ripon Grammar. So, whatever you said, it worked. Robert : Marvellous. Some good news at last. Jane : I hate to hear you talk like that. Robert : I'm sorry, that was selfish of me to spoil your happy moment. Jane : You need never say "sorry" to me. How are you, really? Robert : Since you ask, I'm wretched. I lost my youngest child today, I suspect forever, and I can't see any way around it. Jane : I wish you knew how much I want to help. Robert : Do you? Jane : I think you know I do. [Robert holds out his hand and Jane takes it. He leads her into his dressing room.] Mr Carson : I'll see if I can get up tomorrow. Mrs Hughes : Don't be foolish. You're ill. And in all probability, you're going to be a lot iller in the morning. Mr Carson : But how will you manage? And what about the wedding? Mrs Hughes : I'm not sure there'll even be a wedding. But either way, I won't burden you with it. Mr Carson : P-- perhaps Mr Molesley could come on a permanent basis until I'm better. Mrs Hughes : I doubt that's a solution, Mr Carson. Neither my patience nor his liver could stand it. [Mrs Hughes gestures for him to drink up his medicine.] Robert : Who is it? Mr Bates : I'm sorry, my lord, we never settled a time you wanted to be woken. Robert : Early, I think, with everyone ill. Seven. I'll breakfast at half past. Mr Bates : Very good, milord. Goodnight. [Bates leaves and Robert closes the door and closes his eyes.] Robert : This isn't fair. I'm placing you in an impossible situation. Jane : I want to be with you. Let me. [Jane tries to kiss him, but he takes her hands and pulls back.] Jane : I see. You don't want me now. Robert : I want you with every fibre of my being, but it isn't fair to you; it isn't fair to anyone. I wish I were different. I wish everything were different. Jane : I don't want you different. I like you the way you are. ROBERT (sigh) 
Thank you for that. I will cherish it. Truly. [She tries to kiss him again, but he won't let her. He opens the door and checks the hall, then returns to the room and Jane leaves.] Mrs Hughes : What can I bring to help? O'Brien : Ice to bring her temperature down. Lady Mary : Mrs Hughes, Sir Richard telephoned this morning. He's coming down to help. I wonder if you could have some rooms made ready for him and his valet, and tell Mrs Patmore. Mrs Hughes : Very good, milady. Branson : But I don't accept that I am ruining her life. Nor that I'm cutting her off from her family. If you want to cut her off, that's your decision. Robert : But how will you look after her? How can you hope to provide for her? Branson : With respect, milord, you seem to think that she can only be happy in some version of Downton Abbey when it's obvious that if she wanted that life, she would not be marrying me. [Robert tosses his hat and cane on the bed.] Robert : Very well. [Robert sits in a chair.] Robert : I'd hoped to avoid this, but I see that I can't. [Robert pulls out a check book and pen and opens it on the table next to him.] Robert : How much will you take to leave us in peace? [Branson is stunned.] Branson : What? Robert : You must have doubts. You said your own mother thinks you foolish. Branson : Yes, she does. Robert : Then yield to those doubts and take enough to make a new life back in Ireland. I'll be generous if we can bring this nonsense to an end. Branson : (scoffs) I see. You know, your trouble, milord, you're like all of your kind. You think you have the monopoly of honour. [Robert looks up sharply from writing his check.] Branson : Doesn't it occur to you that I might believe the best guarantee of Sybil's happiness lies with me? Robert : Well! [Robert puts his check book away and stands up.] Robert : If you are not prepared to listen to reason-- Branson : I'm not prepared to listen to insults. Robert : Then I will bid you a good day. [Robert picks up his hat and cane.] Robert : And I want you to leave the village. Branson : Even though she'll come to me the moment I call? Do you really want me to leave now when I will take her with me that same hour? [Robert leaves without a word.] Isobel : Ah, there you are. Dr Clarkson's here. Cora's not at all well. Sybil and Edith are with her. Mary's gone to meet Sir Richard from the train. Robert : What's he come for? Isobel : I gather he wants to be useful. Robert : I don't see how. Mrs Hughes : Milord, we're two more maids down. I hope you can forgive some catch as catch can in the days ahead. Robert : Which maids? Not Jane? Mrs Hughes : No, milord, not Jane. [Mrs Hughes turns away and looks confused. Robert heads up the stairs and a maid takes a bowl from Edith who is descending.] Robert : What are they doing? Lady Edith : Decorations for the wedding. It still hasn't been cancelled. Until it is, they have to prepare for it. Mrs Hughes : If Anna or Jane appear, tell them to come and help me do the room for Sir Richard. I'll be in Armada. [Thomas takes the sheets from Mrs Hughes.] Thomas : I can help you with the bedroom, then I'll set up a room for his man, and I'll serve at dinner. Mrs Hughes : But I've no money to pay you. Thomas : Call it rent. Isobel : The awful truth is, the wedding simply cannot go ahead. Matthew : Oh, don't say that. Isobel : I must. Dr Clarkson says you'll be groggy for at least a week, maybe even longer. We have to face the facts. Lavinia : What about my father? Isobel : Well, Matthew can telephone him. Lavinia : He can't come here while everyone's ill. He has a weak chest and mustn't take the risk. Matthew : All right. Well, I suppose we've made a decision, then. To delay. Lavinia : I don't think we've got any choice. Isobel : No, I'm afraid we don't. [Matthew and Isobel exit.] Matthew : At least she doesn't seem too serious. Isobel : No, no. I'd say she's been lucky. But I am terribly sorry about the wedding. Matthew : These things are sent to try us. Robert : Why didn't anyone tell me she was like this? Lady Sybil : She took a turn for the worse about half an hour ago. Where were you? Robert : Out. I went for a walk. [O'Brien enters with a fresh bowl of water and places a cloth over Cora's forehead.] O'Brien : There we are, my lady. That's better, isn't it? LADY SYBIL (whisper) 
She's been with her all night. Robert : O'Brien, you must have a rest. Not just now, milord. If you don't mind, I want to see her through the worst if I can. Now, I'll just make this colder for you. [O'Brien dips the cloth in the water. Robert takes Sybil aside.] Robert : How is she, really? Tell me the truth. Lady Sybil : I can't yet. Dr Clarkson says we will know more in a few hours. Robert : God Almighty, how can this be? My whole life gone over a cliff in the course of a single day. Mr Bates : Take care of that, thank you. [The servant leaves as Anna enters.] Mr Bates : How're you doing? Anna : I'm not sure. Her Ladyship's worse. Mr Bates : I'm sorry. Anna : Jane said you wanted to see me. Mr Bates : It's only to say that I've done it. I've booked the registrar. [Anna beams.] Anna : When for? Mr Bates : He's had a cancellation, so it's...it's Friday afternoon. Anna : This Friday? [Ethel enters with Charlie.] Anna : Ethel? What are you doing here? [Anna greats Charlie as Jane enters.] Jane : Those Bryants have turned up agai-- Ethel : That's what. Anna : I'll find Mrs Hughes and come back for you. [Anna smiles at Bates on her way out.] Mrs Hughes : I hope I haven't kept you waiting. Mrs Bryant : No, no. Mrs Hughes : I'm afraid we have illness in the house, so I hope you can excuse Lord and Lady Grantham. Mr Bryant : It's not them we've come to see, is it? Is she here? Mrs Hughes : She's just coming now. [Anna opens the door for Ethel and Charlie.] Mrs Bryant : May I meet him properly? Ethel : Come along, Charlie. [She carries him to Mrs Bryant, both of them smiling.] Ethel : This nice lady is your grandmother. Mrs Bryant : Perhaps you could call me Gran. Mrs Hughes : He's a stout little chap, isn't he? Mrs Bryant : And so like Charles. I thought it when we were last here. I know what was said at the time and Mr Bryant's sorry for it now, but I could see he was just like Charles. Mr Bryant : Never mind all that. Let's get down to business. Ethel : Business? Mrs Hughes : MR BRYANT 
That's what you want from us, isn't it? Find out what we mean to do for little Charlie in the future. Daisy Mason : What do you mean, "she might die"? O'Brien : What do you think happens with a fatal illness? The fairy's come? Mrs Patmore : By heaven, if anything happens to her, it won't be your fault, Miss O'Brien. I've never seen such care. O'Brien : I wish I could talk to her, that's all, but she doesn't know me. Mrs Patmore : I'm sure she knows how hard you've worked for her. O'Brien : It's not that. There's something I need...Never mind. Either I will or I won't. [O'Brien takes the tray and exits.] Mrs Patmore : You never know people, do you? You can work with them for twenty years and you don't know them at all. Ethel : What? You mean, give him up? Never see him again? Mr Bryant : Those are my terms. Mrs Hughes : But...would it hurt if Ethel were to care for him in your own house? She could be his nurse. Mrs Bryant : That might be possible. Ethel :  Mrs Hughes : MR BRYANT 
Of course she can't be his nurse. Just think for a minute. We mean to bring him up as a gentleman, send him to [Harrowsay?] and Oxford, and all the while his mother's down in the servants' hall? How does that work? Ethel : Well, I-- I could. Mr Bryant : No, no, no. Don't you see? We want to raise him as our grandson, not as a housemaid's b*st*rd. Mrs Bryant : Well, he has to know the truth sometime. Mr Bryant : Maybe. But not for a long time. Till then, his father had a wartime marriage until he died, and his mother succumbed to Spanish flu. Mrs Bryant : A lot of people have. Mrs Hughes : We've quite a few upstairs. Mr Bryant : And that, for many years at least, is all that Charlie will be told. Ethel : So, I'm just to be written out? Painted over, buried? Mr Bryant : What matters is what's good for Charlie. Ethel : No. What's good for Charlie, and what's good for you? [Ethel stands up angry. She walks over to Mrs Bryant.] Ethel : You've got a heart, I know you have. You see what he's asking? [Mr Bryant stands.] Mr Bryant : Ethel, consider this: in the world as it is, compare the two futures. The first as my heir, educated, privileged, rich, able to do what he wants, to marry whom he likes. The second as the b*st*rd son-- [Mrs Hughes stands up.] Mrs Hughes : I think we've heard enough of that word for one day. Mr Bryant : Very well. As the...nameless offshoot of drudge. You're his mother. Which would you choose for him? Ethel : Suppose I could be his nurse and never tell him who I am? Suppose I promised that? [Mrs Bryant stands.] Mrs Bryant : Surely-- Mr Bryant : Come on, we all know that's a promise you could never keep. [Anna enters.] Anna : I'm sorry, Mrs Hughes. We must send for the doctor to come at once. Her Ladyship's much worse. Mrs Bryant : I--I'm afraid-- Mr Bryant : Go where you're needed, we've has our say, and you know how to reach us when you've made your decision. [Mrs Bryant and Ethel exchange a look.] Mr Bryant : Come along Daphne. 
 
 Cora : O'Brien? Is that you, O'Brien? [O'Brien smiles.] O'Brien : Yes, milady. It's me, milady. Cora : You're so good to me. You've always been so good to me. O'Brien : Not always, milady. Cora : So good. O'Brien : No. And the fact is, I want to ask so much for your forgiveness, because I did something once which I bitterly regret. Bitterly. And if you could only know how much-- Cora : So very good. [Cora is clearly still delirious. Robert enters.] Robert : How is she? O'Brien : She slept and she seemed better, then suddenly the fever came back. Robert : O'Brien, thank you for the way you've looked after her. I mean it, I'm very grateful, whatever comes. Matthew : What a marathon, but I think I got them all. Everyone sends love. I've told your father I'll telegraph him as soon as it's safe for him to come. Lavinia : But not before. Isobel : Well, I don't think I should leave you alone. [Matthew sighs.] Isobel : But if you don't tell. [Matthew chuckles and Isobel leaves. He sits in the chair.] Matthew : I've been thinking about the date for the rematch, and...what is it? Lavinia : I wonder if we haven't been rather lucky. Matthew : Well, I think we've both been very lucky. Lavinia : That we've been given a second chance. Matthew : Second chance at what? Lavinia : To be quite, quite sure about what we're doing. Matthew : Darling, what can you mean? Lavinia : The thing is...I might as well say it. When I came downstairs and you and Mary were dancing, I heard what you said...and I saw what you did. Matthew : But that was-- Lavinia : No, it's not that I'm in a rage and a fury. In fact, I think it's noble of you to want to keep your word when things have changed. But I'm not sure it'd be right for me to hold you to it. Matthew : Lavinia, I can explain. Lavinia : No, listen. I've had lots of time to think about it. I love you very, very much, and I've wanted to marry you from the first moment I saw you, all that is true. But I didn't really know what I was taking on. It's not in me to be Queen of the County. I'm a little person, an ordinary person, and when I saw you and Mary together, I thought ,"How fine. How right you look together." Matthew : I-- I don't want to hear this. Lavinia : But you must. Because it isn't a sudden thing. I was starting to worry, and then when you were wounded, I thought it was my calling to look after you and care for you. And I don't think Mary would've done that quite as well as me, really. MATTHEW (laughs) 
No, no. No, not nearly as well. Lavinia : I do have some self-worth. Just not enough to make you marry the wrong person. Matthew : What you're saying is pointless! Mary's marrying somebody else. Lavinia : Is she? We'll see. Matthew : I won't let you do this. Lavinia : You will. But we won't fight about it now. In fact, I'm tired. Can I rest for a bit? We'll talk later. Matthew : Of course. [Matthew gets up and he sees her start to cry just before he leaves.] Lady Mary : It's good of you to come, but I don't really see what you can do. Sir Richard Carlisle : I just thought I better do my bit. You say the chauffeur's gone, so I could always drive the car. Lady Mary : Preferably over the chauffeur. Hm. Sir Richard Carlisle : You father's not having an easy time of it. How's Lady Grantham? Lady Mary : Not well. Clarkson's with her now. Sir Richard Carlisle : And Miss Swire? Lady Mary : Oh, she's... [Something occurs to her and she turns to face Carlisle.] Lady Mary : Is that why you've come? Because I said Lavinia had been taken ill? Sir Richard Carlisle : I was coming up anyway in a day or two for the wedding. Lady Mary : Well, she won't be getting married on Saturday, which I suppose is what you'd like best. Sir Richard Carlisle : But she's not seriously ill? Lady Mary : I see what was worrying you. If Lavinia had been carried off, you wanted to be here to stop Matthew from falling into my arms on a tidal wave of grief. Sir Richard Carlisle : It's a tricky disease. [Thomas enters.] Thomas : His Lordship's asking for you, milady. [Mary gathers her letters and exits] Mrs Hughes : I think we should aim at a sort of buffet dinner. Then they can run in and out as it suits them. I'm sorry to make extra work. Mrs Patmore : Never mind that. At times like these, we must all pull together. Mrs Hughes : Oh, this arrived in the afternoon post, Daisy. [Mrs Hughes hands Daisy a letter. Thomas enters.] Thomas : Tea for Sir Richard in the drawing room. Mrs Hughes : Well, I'm glad to know he's here to help. [Mrs Hughes and Mrs Patmore shake their heads while Daisy reads her letter.] Thomas : I can do it. Mrs Hughes : You're very obliging, Thomas. Thomas : I could take some up to Mr Carson, if you'd like. [Mrs Hughes and Mrs Patmore exchange a look.] Mrs Patmore : Is that from your Mr Mason? Daisy Mason : He's not mine. Mrs Hughes : What does he say? Daisy Mason : He just says again we should talk about William. He wants me to go to his farm. Mrs Patmore : Oh, poor man, will you not visit him? Daisy Mason : I'm not going to any farm. Mrs Hughes : You're all he's got, Daisy. Daisy Mason : Well, then he's got nobody, 'cause he hasn't got me. Anna : Oh, I'm sorry, milady, I didn't think you'd want to change tonight. Lady Mary : I don't. I just need a handkerchief. Anna : How's Her Ladyship? Lady Mary : Not good, I'm afraid. What is it? Anna : I--I don't mean to bother you, milady. Lady Mary : Go on. Anna : Can you keep a secret? Well, I know you can. You see, Mr Bates and I had a plan...to get married this coming Friday. Lady Mary : What? Anna : He's worried the police haven't finished with him, and if he's right, then I'm not going through it with no proper place in his life. Lady Mary : Well, that's a very brave decision. Anna : Or a very stupid one. But, anyway, with Her Ladyship ill now, and half the servants on their backs, and everybody working flat out-- Lady Mary : Where is the marriage to be? Anna : Just in the register office in Ripon. It wouldn't take long, but-- Lady Mary : Go. I'll cover for you. We're all here, and you won't help Mama by changing your plans. [Edith enters.] Lady Edith : You better come. She's worse. [Mary rushes out with Edith.] Dr Clarkson : I've given her the epinephrine. O'Brien  (worried): Doctor! [Cora is gasping for air and her nose is bleeding.] Lady Edith : Oh, no. What does that mean? Dr Clarkson : It's a haemorrhage of the mucus membranes. It's, er, it's not unusual. [Sybil gets a bowl to Cora just in time as she vomits.] O'Brien : It's all right, milady. Don't worry. Don't worry a bit. Everything's going to be all right. Robert  (whisper): Everything is clearly not all right. How bad is it? Dr Clarkson  (low voice): If she lasts through the night, she'll live. [Mary, Edith, and Robert absorb this shock.] Dr Clarkson : What about the others? Lady Mary : Come with me. Dr Clarkson : I'll be back shortly. Dr Clarkson : I've given some medicine to Mrs Hughes. She'll bring it up later. Mr Carson : I gather Her Ladyship is not improving. Dr Clarkson : Ah, well, er...we'll know more tomorrow. Mr Carson : And Miss Swire? Dr Clarkson : Not too bad, I think. I'll go to her when I've seen the rest of the servants. [Someone knocks just as Clarkson heads for the door and he opens it.] Dr Clarkson : Ah. [Clarkson exits as Thomas brings in a tray, to Mr Carson's shock.] Thomas : Thank you, sir. Here we are, Mr Carson. Now, have you got everything you need? [Carson nods.] Thomas : Milady. [Thomas exits cheerfully.] Mr Carson : I wan-- I want to thank you for coming up, my lady. Lady Mary : Not at all. Mr Carson : No, no, I mean it. I know I've been a disappointment to you. Lady Mary : Maybe. But I've relied on your support for too long to do without it entirely. Mr Carson : You'll always have my support, my lady. Lady Mary : And you mine. On which subject... [Mary brings Carson's dinner tray to him.] Lady Mary : I should be careful of Thomas. Mr Carson : I don't know how we're to get rid of him after all this. Lady Mary : But I doubt he'll want to stay a footman forever, so watch out. Lady Mary : You look very smart, Thomas. Thomas : Well, I still have the shirt, milady, and I found my livery in the cupboard, so I thought, why not? [Mary finishes serving up her own plate and walks over to sit next to Matthew.] Sir Richard Carlisle : I have a place for you here. [Mary pauses awkwardly and goes to sit next to Carlisle.] Isobel : How's Lavinia? Matthew : All right, I think. The illness has made her rather...confused. Lady Mary : What do you mean? [Sybil rushes in, wearing her nursing uniform.] Lady Sybil : Matthew! Mary! [Everyone gets up.] Lady Mary : Is it Mama? Lady Sybil : That's what's so...it's Lavinia. [Everyone rushes out except Carlisle. He grabs Mary's arm on her way out.] Sir Richard Carlisle : Let him go to her. Let him be with her. Surely you owe her that. [Mary slips out of his grasp and leaves without a word.] Isobel : What happened? Dr Clarkson : This is how I found her. It's bad, I'm afraid. Very bad. [Lavinia seems to be struggling to breathe.] Dr Clarkson : The worst. Matthew : I don't understand. When I was with her, she was talking, she was fine. Dr Clarkson : It's-- it's a strange disease with sudden, savage changes. I'm terribly sorry. Matthew : Well, what can I do? Can I talk to her? Dr Clarkson : Yes, of course. [Matthew sits in the chair next to the bed and takes Lavinia's hand. The men step away and turn their backs, but the women watch.] Matthew : My darling, can you hear me? It's me. It's Matthew. Lavinia : Matthew. I'm so glad you're here. Matthew : Of course I'm here. Darling, where else would I be? Lavinia : Isn't this better, really? Matthew : I don't understand you. Lavinia : You won't have to make a hard decision. Be happy, for my sake. Promise me. It's all I want for you. Remember that. That's all I want. Matthew : But I can't be happy. Not without you. How could I be happy? [Lavinia dies. Isobel steps forward and the gentlemen turn back around. Clarkson checks her pulse, then places a hand on Matthew's shoulder and steps away.] Matthew : What are you doing? Thomas : They were put up for the wedding, Mr Crawley. [Robert approaches Matthew.] Robert : My dear chap, I cannot find the words to say how sorry I am. Matthew : How is Cousin Cora? Robert : Much better, thank you. Matthew : Glad to hear it. I came up to see if there's anything I need to do. Robert : We've taken care of all that. As you know, we always use Graspy's. Matthew : Of course. Robert : Travis has suggested Monday for the funeral to give people time to get here. It'll be in tomorrow's paper. Matthew : That's very kind of you. Robert : I know Mary wanted to-- Matthew : No. Robert : --see you. Matthew : I mean, I...don't really want to see anyone. Not yet. Now I know everything's settled, I'll go back. Robert : When you speak to her father, do ask him to stay here Matthew : Thank you. He'll be...very grateful. Robert : Just tell me what you want me to do, and I'll do it. [Matthew zombie walks away.] Mrs Hughes : Are you feeling more yourself? Mr Carson : A bit. I still can't get over it. Mrs Hughes : I hope you'll not pretend you liked her now. Mr Carson : I didn't want her here, Mrs Hughes, I'll admit, but I had no objection to her being happy somewhere else. Robert : A sight to gladden my heart. Cora : Is it? I hope it is. Robert : You gave us quite a fright. Cora : They told me about Lavinia. Robert : The funeral is on Monday. Cora : I'd like to go if I can. [Cora lays her hand on the bed for Robert to take. He takes it.] Cora : We're all right, aren't we Robert? [Robert looks at her face, narrows his eyes, and the replies.] Robert : Of course we are. Cora : Only I know I got so caught up in everything, I think I neglected you, and if I did, I'm sorry. Robert : Don't apologize to me. Mrs Hughes : Ethel! Whatever are you doing here at this time of night? Ethel : I said I'd be back with my answer, and here I am. Mrs Hughes : You know we're a house in mourning. Ethel : Yes. And I'm sorry. But if anything, it's made my mind up for me. Life is short and what's my life without Charlie? They're not having him. Mrs Hughes : (nods) As long as you're sure. Ethel : They say they can do better for him, but what's better than his mother's love? Fancy me that. [Mrs Hughes smiles a little.] Mrs Hughes : I'll write and tell them. [Ethel smiles a little as she steps toward the door.] Ethel : You agree with me, though, don't you? Mrs Hughes : My opinion has no place in this. [Ethel nods and leaves.] Registrar : "I, John Bates," Mr Bates : I, John Bates... Registrar : "Take thee, Anna Mae Smith," Mr Bates : Take thee, Anna Mae Smith... Registrar : "To be my wedded wife." Mr Bates : To be my wedded wife. Registrar : "I, Anna Mae Smith," Anna : I, Anna Mae Smith... Registrar : "Take thee, John Bates..." Anna : Take thee, John Bates... Registrar : "To be my wedded husband." Anna : To be my wedded husband. Registrar : And now the ring. [Bates puts the ring on the tip of Anna's finger.] Registrar : "With this ring, I plight thee my troth" Mr Bates : With this ring, I plight thee my troth... Registrar : "As a symbol of all we have promised." Mr Bates : As a symbol of all we have promised. Registrar : And all that we share. Mr Bates : And all that we share. [Bates slides the ring the rest of the way onto Anna's finger. They beam at each other.] Registrar : It, therefore, gives me great pleasure to say you are now husband and wife together. [They kiss.] Jane : You rang, milord? Robert : I keep forgetting Carson's ill. Jane : Mrs Hughes says he's much better. Robert : I really want Bates, he'd gone out earlier. Jane : He's in the dressing room. He went up with your evening shirt. [Robert checks his watch.] Robert : Golly, is that the time? [Robert gets up and Jane turns to leave.] Robert : Actually, can you stay a moment? I was trying to think how to contrive a meeting and here you are. You see-- Jane : I'm glad Lady Grantham's better. Truly. and don't worry, there's no harm done. Robert : No harm done yet. Jane : I'm almost packed...and I've given in my notice. [Robert stares for a moment, then nods. He takes a note from his desk and hands it to her.] Robert : This is the name and address of my man of business. Jane : Why? You don't owe me anything. Robert : It's not for you. It's for Freddy. Let me give him a start in life. [Jane shakes her head and tries to look anywhere but Robert.] Jane : I'm not sure. Robert : It would make me very happy. Jane : If I thought that, then I'd take it gladly. Will you be happy? Really? Robert : I have no right to be unhappy, which is almost the same. Jane : Almost. Not quite. Can I kiss you before I go? [Robert leans in and kisses her. She starts to cry as they part. She exits and he stares after her.] Lady Mary : The secret Mrs Bates. [Anna and Mary smile.] Anna Bates : We will tell everyone, but I thought we should leave it for a while. At least 'til after the funeral, anyway. Lady Mary : You'll have to control yourselves. Anna Bates : Well, we've had enough practice. [Anna finishes braiding Mary's hair and Mary walks toward the door.] Lady Mary : Come with me. [Anna follows Mary down the corridor. Mary looks back at her and smiles.] Lady Mary : Smuggle Bates in here when everyone has gone to bed. And for heaven's sake, make sure he gets the right room. [Anna chuckles.] Anna Bates : I don't know what to say, milady. Who did all this? Lady Mary : Jane. I told her. She said it would be her leaving present. You can stay all night. She won't tell. Anna Bates : Milady, thank you. Very, very much. [Mary smiles.] Thomas : Are you sure you should be up, Mr Carson? Mr Carson : I wanted to check the silver before tomorrow. Thomas : I think I've cleaned all the pieces we might need. We'll get everything ready the moment breakfast is over. Mr Carson : Thank you for the way you've kept it all going, Thomas. I wish I knew how to express my gratitude. Thomas : You'll find a way, Mr Carson. [Carson holds out his hand and Thomas gives him the silver cabinet keys.] Mrs Hughes : I think that's everything we owe. Jane : Thank you, Mrs Hughes. Mrs Hughes : I'm sorry you're going, Jane. You're a good worker. I wish you well. Jane : I'm sorry, too, Mrs Hughes. But in the end I think it's for the best. For everyone. Mrs Hughes : When all is said and done, my dear, you may be right. [Jane leaves and Mrs Hughes considers the matter for a moment. She totally knows.] Mr Bates : Well...Mrs Bates...you've had your way with me. [They giggle.] Mr Bates : I just hope you don't live to regret it. Anna Bates : I couldn't regret it. No matter what comes. I know only that I am now who I was meant to be. Mr Bates : I'm not worthy of you, that's all I know. And they'll call me names for pulling you into my troubles. [Anna sighs.] Anna Bates : Mr Bates, we've waited long enough to be together, you and I, and now that we're man and wife, can we let that be enough just for this one night? [They kiss.] Reverend Travis : Earth to earth, ashes to ashes, dust to dust. [The minister throws dirt on Lavinia's coffin.] Reverend Travis : In sure and certain hope of the resurrection to eternal life through our Lord Jesus Christ, who shall change our vile body that may be like unto his glorious body according to the mighty working whereby he is able to subdue all things to himself. Amen. All : Amen. Lady Mary : Would you give him a moment? Sir Richard Carlisle : Of course not, I understand. [The mourners leave except Matthew. Mary approaches him by Lavinia's grave. Anna Bates, Mrs Hughes, Mr Carson, and Mr Bates walk back to the house.] Mrs Hughes : We better get moving if we're to be back there before they arrive. Anna : Mrs Patmore and Thomas will go ahead in the trap. They'll sort it out between them. Mrs Hughes : Mm, I've no doubt Thomas will have everything sorted out. [Mrs Hughes gives Carson a significant look.] Mr Carson : I'm sorry Mrs Hughes, but it's no good thinking that we'll get shot of him now. Why doesn't that come as a surprise? [Daisy sees Matthew standing at William's grave as she walks back. He sees her and she goes to him.] Mr Mason : I've been hoping I might meet you here one day. I expect you come as often as I try to do. Daisy Mason : It was a funeral...of a lady that was going to marry Mr Crawley. Mr Mason : I heard about that. There's nothing so wrong as when young folks die. [Daisy wipes her eyes.] Mr Mason : Hey, needn't hide your tears from me, love. [He hands her a handkerchief.] Mr Mason : It does me good to see how much you loved him. It does. [Back at Lavinia's grave.] Lady Mary : You must tell me if there's anything I can do. Anything at all. Matthew : Thank you, but I don't think so. [Mary nods and turns to go.] Matthew : That night when we were dancing and Lavinia came downstairs...she heard. She...she saw...everything. Lady Mary : How terrible for her. I'm so sorry. Matthew : Because of what she saw, she thought we should cancel the wedding. That I belonged with you, not with her. She gave up because of us. She said to me when she was dying, "Isn't this better?" I know it's a cliché, but...I believe she died of a broken heart, because of that kiss. And we were the ones who killed her. Lady Mary : Oh, Matthew. Matthew : We could never be happy now, don't you see? We are cursed, you and I. And there's nothing to be done about it. Let's be strong, Mary. And let's accept...that this is the end. Lady Mary : Of course it's the end. How could it not be? [Carlisle walks up.] Sir Richard Carlisle : I'm so very sorry about this. Matthew : Thank you. Sir Richard Carlisle : Can I walk you up to the house or, er...? Lady Mary : Certainly you can. I want you to. [Mary and Carlisle walk arm in arm back to the house, Mary just as upset as Matthew. Robert and Violet visit with Dr Clarkson and Reverend Travis. Robert looks over to see Branson talking to Sybil and goes to them.] Lady Sybil : It's so sad. Branson : Yes. Robert : Why are you here ? Branson : To pay my respects to Miss Swire, and to see Sybil. Robert : Lady Sybil. Lady Sybil : Oh, Papa, what's the point in all that nonsense? Robert : I suppose you'll go to Dublin now. Isn't that your plan? Lady Sybil : In a day or two. Mama is well again and I see no reason to delay. Although, I do so wish we could have parted friends. Robert : What about you? Do you want to "part friends"? Branson : I do. Although, I don't expect to. [Branson and Sybil turn to go.] Robert : All right. [They stop and turn back around.] Lady Sybil : What? Robert : Well, if I can't stop you, I see no profit in a quarrel. You'll have a very different life from the one you might have lived, but if you're sure it's what you want. [Sybil looks at Branson with a smile.] Lady Sybil : I am. Robert : Then you may take my blessing with you, whatever that means. Lady Sybil : Oh, Papa. It means more than anything! [She hugs him with delight.] Lady Sybil : More than anything! Robert : If you mistreat her, I will personally have you torn to pieces by wild dogs. Branson : I'd expect no less. Lady Sybil : Will you come over for the wedding? Robert : We'll see. We'll talk about that later. And there'll be some money. But not much. [Sybil smiles and kisses him on the cheek. Sybil and Branson walk off hand in hand. Violet approaches Robert and they follow.] Violet : So, you've given in? Robert : She would've gone anyway. [Violet makes a noise at that.] Robert : And perhaps we should let Lavinia's last gift to us be a reminder of what really matters. Of course, you'll think that's soft. Violet : Well, not at all. The aristocracy has not survived by its intransigence. Oh, no, no, we must work with what we've got to minimize the scandal. Robert : But what have we got to work with? Violet : Well, you'd be surprised. He's political, isn't he? And a writer. Well, I could make something out of that. And there's a family called Branson with a place not far from Cork. I believe they have a connection with the Howards. Well, surely, we can hitch him onto them. Mrs Patmore : Mr Bates. Mr Bates : Are you all right, Mrs Patmore? Mrs Patmore : I'm all right. There are two men waiting for you in the servants' hall. [Mrs Patmore looks worried. Bates and Anna walk to the servants' hall. Mrs Hughes and Carson see the men and turn back to watch Mr Bates enter.] Mr Bates : Are you looking for me? Policeman : John Bates? Mr Bates : Yes. Policeman : You are under arrest on the charge of wilful murder. You are not obliged to say anything unless you desire to do so. Whatever you say will be taken down in writing and may be given in evidence against you upon your trial. Mr Bates : I understand. [The other policeman takes Bates's wrist.] Anna Bates : No. No-- Mr Bates : Please...do whatever is required. [The policeman cuffs Bates.] Mr Bates : I love you. Mrs Bates : And I love you. For richer, for poorer, for better, for worse. [Anna kisses him.] Policeman : Come along, sir. [They lead Bates down the corridor, past all of the servants. Anna Bates stands in the servants hall watching after them, lip trembling.]
