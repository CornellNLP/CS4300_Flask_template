 (THEME MUSIC PLAYING) 
 I think it's held up very well, all things considered. 
 Especially after all that rain. 
 How's the house team coming on? 
 Because we're taking this very seriously in the village. 
 Nobody takes it more seriously than his Lordship, Dad. 
 Whatever he likes to pretend. 
 Mr Bates has had his rest now and wants to get back to work. 
 It's time to draw a line under this whole unfortunate episode. 
 So, I go out the window? 
 I cannot hide that I find your situation revolting but, whether or not you believe me, I am not entirely unsympathetic. 
 You have been twisted by nature into something foul and even I can see that you did not ask for it. 
 I think it better that you resign quietly, citing the excuse that Mr Bates has returned. 
 I will write a perfectly acceptable reference and you will find that there's nothing about it that's hard to explain. 
 I see. 
 What about tonight? 
 Well, it's nearly time to change, so you should dress him tonight and let Mr Bates take over tomorrow. 
 I am not foul, Mr Carson. 
 I am not the same as you, but I am not foul. 
 Yes, well, we've spoken enough on this subject. 
 Now, if you'll excuse me, I'll ring the gong. 
 Come along, Miss O'Brien, time to stop eavesdropping and do some work. 
 I don't know what you... 
 How are you getting on with the cricket team? 
 We should be all right. We've still got Thomas, thank God. 
 Won't he be leaving soon? 
 Not before the match if I've got anything to do with it. 
 One of the gardeners told Anna their team is in terrific shape. 
 It's so unfair the outside staff play for the village. 
 Why don't you support the house and the village? 
 You own both. 
 But I'm captain of the house team. 
 If I were you, I'd be captain of the village. They always win. 
 Not always. Usually, but not always. 
 Mary, you look as if you're in a trance. What were you doing in London? 
 It's worn you out. 
 Maybe. I'll try and rest tomorrow. 
 Crikey, I'd better go. 
 Before you do, a little bird tells me Mr Carson has made up his mind to deal with Thomas after all. 
 Well, it's about time. 
 I only meant, if you want to register your anger at how Thomas treated you, now is the hour. 
 I'm not sure. I'm still disgusted by the whole thing, obviously. 
 Obviously. 
 But if you don't speak out, people might think you weren't disgusted at all. 
 Now, you must excuse me. I ought to be upstairs. 
 Anna, what are you doing out here? 
 Her Ladyship's with Lady Mary, sir. 
 I'm afraid she's going to be late. 
 Let me see what's happening. 
 You couldn't be in better hands than Dr Ryder's. Truly. 
 I hope to God you're right. 
 Anna's worried you're getting late. 
 Heavens, you made me jump. 
 I must go. O'Brien will scold me. 
 What were you talking about? 
 Nothing. Women's stuff. 
 Your ears must've been burning earlier. 
 Papa was discussing the cricket match. 
 The village thrashed <i>us</i> last year. 
 I suppose I'll have to play? 
 You suppose right. 
 It's because of last year he's absolutely determined to win this time. 
 Bates must count himself lucky to be out of it. 
 I think he'd like to walk normally, sir, even if playing cricket was the price he had to pay. 
 Of course he would. I'm so sorry. That was stupid of me. 
 It's quite all right, sir. I was only joking. 
 Oh, there's absolutely no question that some people have a feel for it- 
 I think cricket's like anything else. 
 (PUFFING) 
 When you learn it as a child, there's an understanding that is hard to come by later. 
 And with a father like mine... I was brought up with cricket in my blood. 
 Why have you never played in the match before? 
 How could I? I didn't work at the house until this year. 
 I could hardly play for the village team. 
 We'll have to start a fan club, won't we? 
 That's kind, Ivy, but I just want to do my best for the house. That's all the reward I seek. 
 Oh, your modesty is an example to us all, Mr Molesley. 
 (ALL CHUCKLING) 
 What is that you're so glued to? 
 This week's column. I've got to send it off tomorrow. 
 What's it about? 
 The poor soldiers. 
 How many are reduced to begging on the streets. 
 And some officers are working as dance partners in nightclubs. 
 After the trenches, even the Embassy Club must seem an improvement. 
 You shouldn't make fun of them. 
 She's forgetting that you were in the trenches and she wasn't. 
 She must be 18 by now. 
 Little Rose, 18? How scary! 
 Hello. 
 It's quite a responsibility. 
 Well, I couldn't say no. Her mother is my niece and my godchild and she asked it as a special favour. 
 Apparently, she hates London. 
 And they can't get to Scotland until July. 
 Poor Shrimpie, his work keeps him nailed to his desk. 
 She hates London, so she's coming to a great-aunt in Yorkshire to have <i>a</i> good time? 
 Mmm-hmm. 
 How original. 
 Well, don't be silly. Of course you will. 
 No, I won't. I'd like to help. 
 But I've never played a game of cricket in my life. 
 Oddly, the game was never part of my childhood. 
 Didn't you play last year? 
 No. Nor the year before that. 
 The fact is, I've never played cricket. 
 But couldn't you try? 
 Robert, stop being such a bully. Let's just have a nice dinner. 
 I'm afraid I've heard Mr Carson's going to let him off. 
 And what can I do about it? 
 Say you won't tolerate it. 
 Unless he's going to give him a bad reference, you're going to tell the police. 
 I couldn't do that, could I? 
 Why not? And won't you have to? 
 If you don't want folk to think there's something funny about you. 
 It's a good job that's supposed to be eaten cold. 
 Are you sure about Rose? Wouldn't it be better if she stayed here? 
 No, no, no. I'm quite looking forward to it. 
 I couldn't manage an 18-year-old. Not these days. 
 I wouldn't know what she was talking about. 
 My husband was a great traveller, so I have spent many happy evenings without understanding a word. 
 The thing is to keep smiling and never look as if you disapprove. 
 So, Bates, I'll see you on duty tomorrow. 
 Good night, Barrow. You do know I wish you every good fortune. 
 I believe so. Thank you, milord. 
 To the victor the spoils. 
 What will you do? 
 Oh, what's it to you? 
 You're right. It's nothing to me. 
 If we can buy out Simpson and Tucker, quite a chunk of the estate will be back in hand. 
 We'll be operating a real business. 
 That's why I think the cricket may have come at rather a good time. 
 Why? Because you think if you get a few runs and catch someone out, Papa will accept all this gladly? 
 I think the cricket will show him it doesn't mean we can't keep up the old traditions as well. 
 And am I to help persuade him? 
 Of course. You're on my team now. 
 You can kiss me, but that's it. 
 Why? Haven't you missed me? 
 Desperately. But London seems to have tired me out. 
 Come. 
 Mr Carson, is it true Mr Barrow's leaving? 
 Yes, and for what it's worth, I think he was genuinely mistaken over the incident and he's sorry now. 
 Which, of course, is no excuse. 
 I want to be sure you'll give him a bad reference. 
 I'm sorry? 
 I can't let a man like that go to work in innocent people's houses. 
 I will write him the character I think he deserves. 
 Can I read it? 
 Certainly not. 
 Because I've been thinking, I ought to report him to the police. 
 What? 
 It's my duty. 
 I know today thinking is much more liberal... 
 Now, just a minute. 
 I've never been called a liberal in my life and I don't intend to start now! 
 But I do not believe in scandal. 
 Mr Barrow will go, and when he does, I would like him to go quietly. 
 For the sake of the house, the family and, for that matter, you. 
 I'm sorry, Mr Carson, but I can't stay quiet if my conscience prompts me differently. 
 I won't turn a blind eye to sin. 
 I've asked Ethel to bring us some coffee. 
 Oh, I'm not supposed to drink coffee. My mother doesn't approve. 
 Would you like something else? 
 Absolutely not. After all, she won't find out unless you tell her. 
 How is Lady Flintshire? 
 Well, incredibly busy. 
 Daddy works harder than a slave, and so she has to manage everything else by herself. 
 I doubt he works harder than a slave. 
 Cousin Isobel is very literal. 
 Now, I have something for you. 
 Shall I pour, ma'am'? 
 No, thank you. I'll do it. 
 These are the first answers to the advertisement. 
 Cousin Violet is trying to find a new job for my cook. 
 That sounds rather inconvenient. 
 Cousin Violet has never let a matter of convenience stand in the way of a principle. 
 As the kettle said to the pot. 
 I'm to leave with no reference? 
 After working here for ten years? 
 I'm afraid my hands are tied. 
 I'll never get a job now, Mr Carson. 
 Does his Lordship know about this? 
 No. 
 Then I'm going to tell him. 
 And how would you do that, without telling him the rest of it? 
 This wasn't Jimmy's idea. Somebody's put him up to it. 
 He wouldn't be so unkind, not left to himself. 
 I'm almost touched that you will defend him under such circumstances. 
 But there it is. 
 Well, can I stay here for a day or two while I..ome up with some sort of plan? 
 Yes, I think I can allow that. But that's the best I can do. 
 Thank you, Mr Carson. 
 At least it doesn't smell damp. 
 I think it's nice. 
 Or it will be when it's got a lick of paint. 
 I can do that. 
 I can. 
 You're not climbing any ladders. 
 But, yes, together I think we can make it really comfy. 
 What do they call extreme optimism? 
 They call it "making the best of things" and that is what we'll do. 
 You being in this room is enough to make it nice. 
 (GIGGLES) 
 Come here. 
 We should think of some things to do while you're here. 
 Edith, you should take Rose over to Whitby on Wednesday when they have their market. She'd enjoy that. 
 I can't. I'm going to London on Wednesday. 
 Oh, well could I come? 
 Oh, but you've only just got here. I thought you hated London. 
 Who told you that? 
 Susan. 
 (CHUCKLES) Darling Mummy. 
 Well, should I correct her? 
 Oh, no. She's right, really. 
 But I'm planning a surprise for her and I need to go to London to arrange it. 
 You won't give me away, will you? 
 Won't you stay with your parents? 
 Well, I can't. That would spoil everything. 
 You can stay with me. 
 Aunt Rosamund won't mind and there's plenty of room. 
 I don't even know why you're going. 
 To see my editor. To discuss my article. 
 I think I might come up with you to London. 
 I'll ring the office in the morning. I can stay at my club. 
 Don't do that. Aunt Rosamund would love to have you. 
 And I suspect I'll need help controlling Rose. 
 Why do you say that? 
 I'm not sure. Instinct. 
 But when your mother finds out, will she mind? 
 No, she'll be delighted and so grateful to all of you for helping with my secret. 
 Besides, with Edith as my chaperone, what harm can I come to? 
 But how can I help? 
 If our plan works, we'll be farming a third of the estate directly. 
 And you can manage that? 
 We think so, but we need you to think so, too. 
 Because Lord Grantham definitely won't. 
 Are you drawing up the battle lines? 
 Poor Robert. 
 The post-war world is not being kind to him. 
 How are you getting on with the agent's house? 
 I hope Jarvis didn't leave it a wreck. 
 No, not at all. 
 But the furniture was his, so I'll have to begin in a state of Trappist simplicity. 
 Well, I'm sure there's some stuff in the attics here. 
 We'll have a look. 
 What about Sybbie? Won't it be lonely for her with just you and Nanny and nobody else for company? 
 I think it's right for both of us. 
 (CRYING) 
 MRS HUGHES: Mr Barrow? 
 (SOBS) 
 What in heaven's name are you doing out here? 
 I know you're leaving, but things can't be as black as all that. 
 You're trained now. You can apply for a position as a butler. 
 You don't know everything, then. 
 Then will you tell me everything? 
 Look, I'm afraid if I do, Mrs Hughes, that..t will shock and disgust you. 
 "Shock and disgust"? My, my. I think I have to hear it now. 
 Come on. 
 Lady Grantham, the Dowager that is, has been concerned that your history here has left you lonely. 
 She's kind to concern herself. 
 It's not just that. 
 She believes you have made this house a local topic of unwelcome conversation. 
 Ah. 
 So she's placed an advertisement for you and she's got some replies. 
 The point is, you would go to your new position with references from me and from Mrs Hughes, and you would not have to refer to your earlier life. 
 In effect, you'd be washed clean. 
 Yes? 
 Is the new maid working out? 
 No, not really. I don't think she'll stay. 
 I miss Anna. 
 What do you call her now she's your maid? 
 Anna, I'm afraid. 
 I can't very well call her Bates. 
 No. What's this about? 
 Well, you know Matthew wants to come with you to London. 
 Why shouldn't he? 
 I just need to check which train you're planning to come back on. 
 The three o'clock on Thursday, why? 
 Can you promise not to let him catch an earlier one? 
 Of course not. What reason would I give? 
 You can think of something. Please. 
 Oh, all right. But why is everything always so complicated? 
 We'll talk about it when Matthew gets back from London. 
 Can't I even have a clue? 
 He should tell you. It's his idea. 
 God, it sounds ominous. 
 What does? 
 Matthew has some ghastly scheme for the estate and Tom's too frightened to say what it is. 
 I need a drink. 
 You cannot allow him to blackmail you like this. 
 And before you ask, Thomas has told me the whole story. 
 I am only sorry you had to listen to such horrors. 
 Why? Do you think Thomas is the first man of that sort that I've ever come across? 
 I would hope so. 
 Well, he isn't. 
 And I'll tell you something else. 
 I think James may have led him on. 
 What? No, I cannot listen to such allegations. 
 Calm down. I don't mean deliberately. 
 But he's a vain and silly ﬂirt. 
 He may have given Thomas the wrong impression without meaning to. 
 I can hardly believe we are having this conversation. 
 Maybe not, but I won't sit by and let that young whippersnapper ruin a man for the rest of his life. 
 Not a man who was wounded in the service of King and Country. 
 We may have no choice. 
 These practices, with which you are apparently so familiar, are against the law. 
 I know that! 
 Very well, then. If we stand up to James and he goes to the police, it will only put Thomas in prison, which he will not thank you for. 
 Inspecting the love nest? 
 Just fetching some coal. 
 I envy you. 
 Whatever you say. 
 No, I mean it. 
 The happy couple and everyone's so pleased for you. 
 I can't imagine what that's like. 
 Perhaps you should try being nicer. 
 It's being nice that got me into trouble. 
 What do you mean? 
 Never mind. 
 I'll be gone soon and out of your hair. 
 You'll be glad of that. 
 Yes, I will be. 
 I assume I can count on you, Mr Molesley? 
 Oh, I'll say. There's not much I don't know about cricket. 
 You make me quite nervous. 
 So with you, me, James, Alfred, both you hall boys, that makes six from down here. 
 I can't play, Mr Carson, but I can keep score. 
 Good. Very good. 
 So with his Lordship, Mr Crawley, and Mr Branson, we're already ten. 
 What about you, Mr Barrow? 
 I think I'll be gone by then. 
 Yes, you will. 
 Where's Mary? I was looking for her, but Anna said she'd gone out. 
 She's away for the night. 
 She'll be back tomorrow. 
 Oh? 
 Cora, is everything <i>as</i> it should be between them? 
 Between Mary and Matthew? Oh, yes, I think so. Why do you ask? 
 Oh, I find I'm rather impatient to get the succession settled. 
 Robert, it's still early days. 
 Luncheon is served, milady 
 Is it just us? 
 Yes, Tom's on the other side of the estate, so he said he'd eat in a pub. 
 He's hiding from me until Matthew has told me the worst. 
 Probably. 
 May I take the opportunity to bring your Lordship up to date with the team? 
 Are we in good shape? 
 I reckon that with three family players and seven from downstairs, we're only one short. 
 Two short. Branson won't play. 
 Mr Branson is busy at the moment. 
 Is he, milady? 
 Might I point out that we're all busy, but we still find time to support the honour of the house. 
 Yes. 
 But that is not the right road to travel, Carson, if we want to remain in her Ladyship's good graces. 
 Now, I know you're here because you all have lots of things to do, so just run about and do them. 
 EDITH: I'll go up and change. 
 But I thought we'd all have dinner together and then we can have a proper catch-up. 
 If that's what you'd like, but please don't let me be a nuisance. 
 But we could always just... 
 I insist. 
 A good family gossip will be my payment in kind. 
 Then, of course, we'd be delighted. 
 Good. We dine at 8:30. 
 Hello, operator? 
 OPERATOR: Number, please. 
 Knightsbridge 4056. 
 I've been through those replies to her Ladyship's advertisement and I don't think there's one where I should be happier than here. 
 That's very ﬂattering. 
 There was a nice letter from a Mrs Watson but it was near Cheadle. 
 Cheadle's very close to where Mr and Mrs Bryant live. 
 Oh, I see. 
 And you feel that would defeat the purpose, if the goal is to leave your past behind you? 
 Don't you, ma'am? 
 Yes, I'm afraid I do. 
 It's a pity if it was the only one that was appealing. 
 So, it looks as if I'll be staying on. 
 I'm sorry if it makes trouble between you and the Dowager. 
 Oh, don't worry about that. 
 If you had gone, she'd have found some other bone for us to fight over. 
 You look very pretty today. 
 I'm not sure how professional it is of me to point that out. 
 Well, it's jolly nice of you. 
 So, uh, business. 
 Now, I've read your piece. 
 Of course, the plight of ex-soldiers is not an obvious topic for a woman's column. 
 I know it isn't very feminine, but I felt so strongly about it, I thought it was worth a try. 
 No, no, you misunderstand me. 
 I like the idea of a woman taking a position on a man's subject. 
 And I was going to say, don't be afraid of being serious when it feels right. 
 Really? 
 Really. 
 You know, I think we're onto something new here. 
 The mature female voice in debate. 
 I don't like the sound of "mature." 
 No, um, balanced? 
 Yes. Let's go with "balanced." 
 Are you in town tonight and by any chance looking for something to do? 
 I am, but sadly I'm spoken for. 
 It's a PW 
 But you will let me know when you're up in London again? 
 But why are you bothering with Thomas? 
 He's going. Good riddance. 
 I don't know. 
 Something he said. 
 I feel funny taking his job. 
 You haven't taken his job. 
 He filled in for you while you were away, that's all. 
 Hmm. 
 I might ask Mrs Hughes. She usually knows what's going on. 
 Oh! 
 (LAUGHS) Which is more than you do. 
 Taxi! 
 Warwick Square, please. 
 Now I understand. 
 You're not too shocked, then? 
 No. 
 But why is Mr Carson'? It's not <i>as</i> if none of us knew. 
 I think the point is we didn't know officially. 
 That's what Mr Carson finds hard. 
 He can't avoid the subject any longer, because it's lying there on the mat. 
 And he can't stand up to Jimmy? 
 He <i>says</i> he's powerless. 
 And it's true we won't help Thomas by putting him in prison. 
 I wouldn't wish that on any man. 
 Imagine me feeling sorry for Thomas. 
 Life is full of surprises. 
 You don't think we should have waited? 
 No. Why should your delicious dinner be spoiled just because Rose has forgotten the time? 
 It's my fault. I shouldn't have let her out of my sight. 
 Nonsense. You had stuff to see to. 
 Talking of which, how did you get on today with your editor? 
 Oh. Quite well, I think. 
 How about you, Matthew? 
 Why, I was only running errands. My main thing is tomorrow. 
 (INDISTINCT TALKING) 
 Mead? What is it? 
 Come on. 
 This is the driver who took up Lady Rose from outside the house, milady. 
 I came back because she left her scarf in the back of my cab. 
 How very good of you. 
 Go on. Tell them why they sent you up to the dining room. 
 I know where she is, ma'am. 
 Your maid downstairs said you might like to hear. 
 And she was right. Where did she go? 
 First to Warwick Square to pick up a friend. 
 And then you took her on somewhere? 
 Eventually. 
 I was sat outside for the best part of two hours. 
 How very expensive. 
 When they came out, they said they wanted to go to a club. 
 The Blue Dragon, on Greek Street. 
 And what sort of club is that? 
 Well, you know. 
 That's the point. I don't. 
 (ROSE GIGGLING) 
 This is like the outer circle from Dante's Inferno. 
 The outer circle? 
 EDITH: There she is. 
 Heavens, what a transformation. 
 And that, presumably, is the friend she spent two hours with in Warwick Square. 
 MATTHEW: Let's not start down that track. 
 Oh, my... 
 How on earth did you find me? 
 How do you do? I am a cousin of Rose's mother. 
 Lady Rosamund Painswick. 
 This is Terence Margadale. 
 Well, how do you do? Please, sit down. 
 Can you bring some more glasses? 
 Tell me, where is Mrs Margadale? 
 She's in the country at the... 
 (ROSE GIGGLING) 
 Terence used to work for Daddy. So, he's more of a family friend, really. 
 Oh, so cousin Shrimpie will be pleased to hear about him, will he? 
 No, please... 
 Why don't we dance? 
 <i>EMCEE: Ladies and gentlemen, one of our songs...</i> 
 Now look, I think I can just about get Rosamund and Edith to keep their mouths shut, if you come back with us now and have nothing more to do with this man. 
 At least, not until you are out of our charge. 
 But you know, he's terribly unhappy and it's not his fault at all. 
 His wife is absolutely horrid. 
 Married men who wish to seduce young women always have horrid wives. 
 I suggest you meet Mrs Margadale before you come to any final conclusions. 
 You're wrong. He's in love with me. 
 He wants to marry me just as soon as he can get a divorce. 
 And when will that be? 
 Well, you see, it's terribly difficult. 
 Yes, I thought it might be. Now, are you going to accept my conditions, or do I throw you to Lady Rosamund? 
 Why are you helping me? 
 I'm on the side of the downtrodden. 
 MATTHEW: Excuse me. 
 I rather like Warwick Square. Sort of Belgravia without the bustle. 
 We haven't been there very long. 
 Rose is feeling rather tired, so we're leaving. 
 Would you at least stay for a... 
 Well, no. No, I'm glad she's staying. 
 But one forgets about parenthood. 
 The on-and-on-ness of it. 
 Were you a very involved mother with Robert and Rosamund? 
 Does it surprise you? 
 A bit. I'd imagined them surrounded by nannies and governesses, being starched and ironed to spend an hour with you after tea. 
 Yes, but it was an hour every day. 
 I see, yes. 
 How tiring. 
 After the money turned up from Mr Swire, things went back to normal. 
 
 
 
 Mr Carson, may I have a word? 
 I'll leave you. 
 Just... 
 CARSON: Well? 
 When's Mr Barrow leaving? 
 I'm not sure. 
 He's lost his job. Why can't he just go? 
 I find it very awkward. 
 He made a mistake. You're still in one piece. 
 Why do you have to be such a big girl's blouse about it? 
 I'm sorry, Mr Carson, but I won't change my mind. 
 I suppose you know who's put him up to this, Mr Carson? 
 That Mr Bates is gobby, isn't he? 
 Why do you say that? 
 Well, everyone used to talk about him <i>as</i> if he could walk on water. 
 But he's got a mouth on him. 
 What did he say? 
 He was sticking up for Mr Barrow. 
 Is this because of about Mr Carson not giving him a reference? 
 I don't think it's right, do you? 
 Yes, I bloody well do think it's right! 
 You know nothing about it! 
 What's happened? 
 What did I say? 
 I shouldn't get involved, dear. 
 If you'll take my advice, I should stay out of it. 
 COUNTESS: Tell me, has there been any progress with Ethel? 
 No. I'm sorry to disappoint you, but she doesn't want to go. 
 Not one of them was right? 
 One. A Mrs Watson. 
 But the house was near where the Bryants live. 
 And to be honest, I suspect that was the reason. 
 A chance to see little Charlie from time to time. 
 Well, I can't blame her for that. 
 Of course not. But the Bryants would be bound to find out, which would only lead to more heartbreak. 
 I'll write to you as soon as I hear. 
 But it's extremely unlikely there is anything wrong at all. 
 This may prove an expensive journey for you. 
 May I ask you a question, Dr Ryder? 
 Has my wife been to see you? 
 I'm not aware of treating a Mrs Crawley. 
 But even if I had, I could not possibly comment on it. 
 Of course. 
 It's only... 
 I can't bear to think of her being worried, when I know very well that if anyone's to blame, it's me. 
 I'm not sure blame is a very useful concept in this area. 
 Please believe me that probability and logic indicate a Crawley baby yowling in its crib before too long. 
 Thank you. 
 Goodbye. 
 Goodbye. 
 Mrs Levinson for Dr Ryder. 
 This should buck you up. 
 Why did you go without saying when I knew all along it was me? 
 You know nothing of the sort. 
 In fact, it was me. 
 What do you mean? 
 There was something wrong with... 
 Actually, I can't talk about this sort of thing. Even to you. 
 You sound like Robert. 
 Well, I am his daughter. 
 The fact is it meant a small operation. 
 What? 
 It's all right. It was weeks ago. 
 That's why I've been keeping you at arm's length. 
 (MATTHEW SIGHS) 
 I thought you'd gone off me. 
 Anyway, today was just to see if all is well and he says it is. 
 He <i>says</i> I'm to get in touch with him in six months' time, but that I'll be pregnant before then. 
 So, now we can start making babies. 
 I feel very guilty not telling Susan about last night. 
 Mummy wouldn't understand. 
 Nor do I. 
 What were you thinking? 
 A respectable, well-born young woman going out with a married man? 
 MATTHEW: Rose knows it all depends on her behaviour for the rest of her stay. 
 One false step and I shall personally telephone Lady Flintshire. 
 Very well. But I don't approve. 
 (ROSE SIGHING) 
 Rose, you've obviously read too many novels about young women admired for their feistiness. 
 Do you think they will keep quiet? 
 I expect so. As long as you stick to your side of the bargain. 
 Even Cousin Rosamund? She didn't like being made to keep the secret. 
 EDITH: Probably because she knows that Granny would be furious. 
 You see how I turn it? First this way and now that. 
 Alfred, what's the matter? 
 Nothing. I'm not easy about this business with Mr Barrow. 
 Well, why not take a turn with Mr Molesley's bat? 
 That'll put a smile on your face. 
 Is Mr Carson really not giving Mr Barrow a reference? 
 What will he do if he hasn't got reference? 
 He could always go abroad. 
 He might do well in America, Mr Barrow. 
 It seems a bit drastic. Why should he go abroad? 
 Keep your nose out of it. 
 Why won't someone tell us what's going on? 
 Because you wouldn't understand it. 
 I very much hope. 
 Why didn't Carson tell me? He's the one who's being undermined. 
 It's a very difficult subject for him to discuss. 
 I can imagine. 
 But it's not <i>as</i> if we didn't all know about Barrow. 
 That's what I said to Mrs Hughes. 
 I mean, if I'd shouted blue murder every time someone tried to kiss me at Eton, I'd have gone hoarse in a month. 
 What a tiresome fellow. 
 It's not the boy's fault, milord. He's been whipped up, told that if he doesn't see it through, we'll all suspect him of batting for the same team. 
 Crikey. But who'd do that? 
 Who's got it in for Barrow? 
 Miss O'Brien. 
 O'Brien? I thought they were as thick as thieves. 
 Not now, milord. 
 Now, I've spoken to your mother. She has a new plan for when you leave here. 
 Aren't I going back to London? 
 Oh, no, no. It's so horrid and dusty. 
 What is Mummy's plan? 
 They're opening Duneagle early. 
 You're to go there. 
 On my own? 
 No. Your Aunt Agatha will keep you company. 
 Alone in Scotland with Aunt Agatha? 
 She can't be serious! 
 I know, I know. Lady Agatha isn't much of a party person, I admit. 
 This is all because I went up to London to see Terence, isn't it? 
 How did she find out? Who gave me away? 
 I don't know who Terence is. 
 Of course, it's not your fault, Aunt Violet. 
 But they promised! 
 Don't shoot the messenger, my dear. 
 I'm only relaying your mother's orders. 
 You're to stay for the cricket match and head north the next day. 
 Perhaps I'll run away. 
 Not this time. 
 My maid will travel with you so you have someone to talk to on the journey. 
 I won't be held a prisoner forever. 
 No. One day you will be older and out of our power. 
 But not yet. 
 Prison has changed you. 
 There was a time when nothing was too bad for me, as far as you were concerned. 
 Prison has changed me. 
 You do know Miss O'Brien is behind it? 
 I knew someone was. 
 Jimmy'd never think of it for himself. 
 Doesn't it bother you that she'll get away with it? 
 Not really. 
 Without a reference after ten years here? 
 You'll never work again. 
 Not in England. 
 But elsewhere maybe. 
 A cousin in Bombay. I might go there. 
 I like the sun. 
 There must be something you know about Miss O'Brien you can use against her. 
 You've heard of the phrase, to know when you're beaten? 
 Well, I'm beaten, Mr Bates. 
 I'm well and truly beaten. 
 Then give me the weapon and I'll do the work. 
 What can I say that will make her change her mind? 
 It is not how we do things! 
 Many of the farmers' families have been at Downton for as long as we have. 
 But we need to see more profits from the farms. 
 Here we go. Profit! Profit! Profit! 
 We cannot go forward with no income. 
 But why not tackle it gradually? 
 Perhaps buy some time by investing your capital. 
 I hear of schemes every day that'll double whatever's put into them or triple it or more. 
 Many schemes offer high rewards, very few deliver them. 
 There's a chap in America, what's his name, Charles Ponzi, who offers a huge return after 90 days. 
 Now Harry Stoke has gone in with a bundle... 
 Then Harry Stoke, whoever he is, is a fool! 
 But if I could find out... 
 Robert, the last time you took an interest in investment, you ruined the family! 
 Now, look here! 
 Robert's been the captain of this ship long enough to be entitled to some respect! 
 He didn't mean to be disrespectful. 
 He does a marvellous impression of it. 
 We are giving the farmers a choice. That's all. 
 If they want to sell, the larger units will let us meet the challenges of the modern world. 
 We need to build something that will last, Papa. 
 Not stand by and watch it crumble into dust. 
 What about the tenants? 
 What about the men and women who've put their trust in us? 
 Is this fair to them? I don't believe so. 
 But isn't the most important thing, for them or us, to maintain Downton as a source of employment? 
 So you're against me, too. 
 It seems to me your plan adds up to carrying on as if nothing's changed, to spend Matthew's money keeping up the illusion, then, when we've fallen into a bottomless pit of debt, we'll sell up and go. 
 So, yes, I believe Matthew is right. 
 I see. 
 You seem to be agreed that there's no place for me in all this. 
 So obviously it's time for me to take a back seat. 
 Hello? Is that The <i>Daily</i> Telegraph information desk? 
 WOMAN: Yes. 
 I want to find out about a London editor. 
 <i>And who is that?</i> 
 Michael Gregson of The Sketch. 
 <i>What would you like to know about him?</i> 
 Just some general stuff, his education, what he's done since then, and a little about his private life. 
 One moment, please. 
 But why here? 
 I don't like the idea of her being our first visitor. 
 I want to be away from the others. 
 I don't know why you're doing this. You don't even like Thomas. 
 Because I know what it is to feel powerless. 
 To see your life slide away and there's nothing you can do to stop it. 
 Quite the orator. 
 Have you thought about standing for Parliament? 
 (KNOCKING ON DOOR) 
 Oh, yes. Very nice. 
 It'll be even better with a bit of money spent on it. 
 Can I get you some tea? 
 If I'm staying long enough. 
 I don't know what it is Mr Bates wants to see me about. 
 You'll have time for tea. 
 Will that be all, ma'am? 
 There is one thing. 
 There was a letter delivered by hand this afternoon. 
 It's from the Dowager. She wants us to call on her in the morning. 
 But why would she want me? 
 No doubt we'll find out in the morning. 
 Well, I am surprised to find that you're a fan of Mr Oscar Wilde. 
 You've known about Mr Barrow all along, so what's changed now? 
 Perhaps I've come to my senses. 
 You mean, you've found a way to be even nastier than usual. 
 Get back in the knife box, Miss Sharp. 
 I want you to persuade Jimmy to let Mr Barrow have a reference, so when he leaves here he can start again. 
 Why would Jimmy listen to me? 
 I won't do it. 
 I think you will. 
 (WHISPERING SOFTLY) 
 I'm going. 
 Sort it out by this evening. 
 Or? 
 Or you'll find your secret is no longer safe with me. 
 (DOOR OPENING) 
 I'm just saying I think you've made your point. 
 To let it go now would be the gentlemanly thing to do. 
 You said that if I let it go, they'd think I was up to the same thing. That I wasn't a proper man. 
 If you'd done nothing, yes, but this way you'll come across as merciful and not vindictive, do you see? 
 I never wanted to push it this far. 
 Then you'll be glad to stop it. 
 You're sure I won't be made to look a fool? 
 Far from it. 
 I think they'll hold you higher in their estimation. 
 Ah, James. Upstairs, please. 
 May I have a word with you, please, Mr Carson, before we go up? 
 But why London? You've only just got back. 
 I've had some bad news, that's all. 
 What sort of bad news? 
 Never mind. It's not our business. 
 How's the cricket team coming along? 
 We're still two short. 
 And you're still determined not to play? 
 It's not that I won't play. I can't play. I don't know how. 
 Stop twisting his arm. Any news on the move, Tom? 
 We're going to miss you both so much. 
 You told Matthew not to twist his arm, now you're doing exactly the same thing. 
 I just think children are happier in families. I'm sorry, but I do. 
 Well, I'm glad that's settled, but I suppose Barrow will have to go? 
 Milord? 
 He's so good at cricket. 
 I know we were soundly beaten last year, but he did get most of our runs. 
 I thought we just wanted him to have a reference, so he could find work when he leaves. 
 I know, but now that I think about it, Carson ought to insist that he stays on. 
 He needs to re-establish his authority over James. 
 Couldn't Mr Barrow just stay till after the match, milord? And then go? 
 That seems rather unkind. Wouldn't we be using him? 
 He might not want to stay, milord, after the unpleasantness. 
 I think he will. 
 But don't forget the cricket. 
 I won't, milord. 
 See how my grip is firm but tender. 
 Cherish the ball, don't crush it. 
 Right. Gabriel. 
 Is it true you've given in and let Mr Barrow get away with it? 
 It was dragging on and on. At least this way, we'll be rid of him. 
 I heard his Lordship wants him to stay for the cricket match. 
 Even if he does, it won't be for much longer. Then he'll get his reference and go. 
 And good riddance. 
 I'm going over to Windmill Farm, to see what we can do with the outbuildings. 
 Would you like to come with me? 
 I'm sure you can manage on your own. 
 Aren't you going? 
 I'll meet him there later. 
 He's putting a good face on it, but you know he wants you with him on this more than anything. 
 I should not serve him well. 
 I don't have the instincts for what he wants to do. 
 You mean you're not a tradesman. 
 Your word, not mine. 
 Shall I tell you how I look at it? 
 Every man or woman who marries into this house, every child born into it, has to put their gifts at the family's disposal. 
 I'm a hard worker and I have some knowledge of the land. 
 Matthew knows the law and the nature of business. 
 Which I do not. 
 You understand the responsibilities we owe to the people round here, those who work for the estate and those that don't. 
 It seems to me if we could manage to pool all of that, if we each do what we can do, then Downton has a real chance. 
 You are very eloquent. 
 You are a good spokesman for Matthew's vision. 
 Better than he has been, recently. 
 So you'll give us your backing? 
 I'll think about it. 
 On one condition. 
 You play cricket for the house. 
 (CARSON GROANING SOFTLY) 
 You said it yourself, "We all have to do what we can do." 
 For God's sake. If it means that much to you. 
 Oh. 
 You didn't expect to find me here. 
 No. 
 I thought the only person who could tell us with any accuracy the Bryants' response to Ethel's working nearby, were the Bryants themselves. 
 Lady Grantham wrote to me, explaining your wish. 
 Well, it was only that Mrs Watson had answered the advertisement... 
 I know the circumstances. 
 Just <i>as</i> I know that you would like to see how Charlie's getting on. 
 As it happens, I've been uncomfortable about keeping a mother from her son. 
 And although I would not want to confuse him until he's much older, if then... 
 You wouldn't have to confuse him. I've already worked it out. 
 I'm his old nanny who was employed by you when he was first born. 
 But what about when he talks about you to Mr Bryant? 
 You will please leave Mr Bryant to me. 
 Now, Ethel, you must write to Mrs Watson today and get it settled. 
 And I'll be able to see Charlie. 
 It won't be easy. 
 It'll be easier than not seeing him. 
 Very much easier. 
 And if Mr Barrow is to stay on, what would he be? My valet? 
 You can make him under butler. 
 Then your dinners will be grand enough for Chu Chin Chow. 
 And he can apply to be a butler when he does leave. 
 But that would make him my superior. 
 Oh, I don't know. Under butler, head valet. There's not much in it. 
 The question remains. How do we convince James? 
 Well, it's his Lordship who wants Mr Barrow to stay on, so I think his Lordship can bring it about. 
 Is this worth it? 
 I've no time to learn anything. 
 Shouldn't I just trust to beginner's luck? 
 Certainly not. 
 I want you to profit from my skills in gratitude for bringing Robert round. 
 Not completely. Not yet. 
 BRANSON: (SIGHS) 
 MATTHEW: Elbow up. 
 You won't make a gentleman of me, you know. 
 You can teach me to fish, to ride and to shoot, but I'll still be an Irish Mick in my heart. 
 So I should hope. 
 There. See? You're getting the hang of it. 
 (CHUCKLES) 
 I'm sorry if this is inconvenient. 
 It's unexpected, not inconvenient. 
 I suppose I'd better just say it. 
 Please do. 
 I had the impression on my last visit that you were flirting. 
 Giving signs that you found me attractive. 
 If I am wrong, then I apologise. 
 You're not wrong. 
 But, since then, I have discovered that you are, in fact, married. 
 Yes. 
 I'm afraid I find the idea of a married man flirting with me wholly repugnant. 
 So, you'll see I must hand in my resignation at once. 
 No, it is true. lam married, but I hope you will allow me to explain. 
 Explain what? I am familiar with the institution of marriage. 
 Yes, but not with this one. 
 My wife is in an asylum and she has been for some years. 
 Lizzie was a wonderful person and I loved her very much. 
 It took me a long time to accept that the woman I knew was gone. 
 And wouldn't be coming back. 
 Then, why haven't you got a divorce? 
 I can't. A lunatic is not deemed responsible. 
 She's neither the guilty nor the innocent party. 
 It means that I'm..ied for the rest of my life to a.. madwoman who doesn't even know me. 
 I can't begin to tell you how much it cheers me to read your column and to meet when we do. 
 I hope very much you'll consider staying on. 
 (TALKING INDISTINCTLY) 
 Heads. 
 Yes! 
 I'm glad everything's settled with Ethel. 
 But I trust you can find another cook without too much difficulty. 
 Preferably one with a blameless record so my house ceases to be a topic of gossip. 
 Which is really what this is all about. 
 Well, if Ethel wants to be part of her son's life, even a little part, who are we to stand in her way? 
 Of course, if you'd had to sell Charlie to the butcher to be chopped up as stew to achieve the same ends, you would have done so. 
 Well, happily, it was not needed. 
 How's that! 
 How's that! 
 (CHEERING AND APPLAUDING) 
 Oh, short serve. 
 Well played, Barrow. Excellent innings. 
 Thank you. 
 I thought I was helping him get out of our lives for good. 
 And now he ranks higher than I do. 
 I've been a damn fool. 
 By the way, what was that phrase he gave you to say to Miss O'Brien? 
 You can tell me now, surely? 
 If you keep it under your hat. 
 It was, "Her Ladyship's soap". 
 What? 
 I can't make any sense of it either, but that's what he said. 
 Her Ladyship's soap. 
 And it worked. 
 It's down to you, Molesley. Last man in. 
 We're in good shape, thanks to Barrow, but we could do with a bonus. 
 Don't worry about me, milord. I'll show them a thing or two. 
 That's the spirit. 
 Well done, Papa. 
 Well, I did my best. 
 We'll just have to hope it's enough. 
 Anna <i>says</i> we are to expect great things of Molesley. 
 Oh. 
 UMPIRE: Out! CROWD: Aw! 
 Well bowled. 
 As usual, our expectations are disappointed. 
 Let's have some tea. 
 I think he must have played somewhere... 
 Who gave me away? 
 Was it you? 
 Certainly not. 
 Because in case you don't know, I'm being sent north tomorrow, with a monster for a jailer! 
 Well, what did she expect? Carrying on with a married man <i>as</i> if her home were in a tree. 
 Granny, who told you? 
 How could you have done that, after you promised? 
 But Mama said you told her. 
 I just filled in the details. 
 I never said a word. 
 Have you tricked me, Mama? 
 Tricked? I am not a conjuror. 
 I only did what was necessary to preserve the honour of the family. 
 In other words, you tricked me. 
 James. 
 You put up a very good show out there. Well done. 
 Thank you, milord. 
 As a matter of fact, I wanted to thank you for your generosity with Barrow. 
 Letting him stay on shows a real largeness of spirit. 
 Stay on? 
 Mr Barrow's staying on? 
 As under butler. I was given the impression you'd allowed it. 
 I allowed him to have a decent reference for when he left. 
 But you won't mind too much, will you? 
 Oh, and by the way, congratulations on your appointment as first footman. 
 What? 
 Thank you, milord. Very much. 
 Lord Grantham, I believe? 
 The same. 
 We're looking for a Mr Alfred Nugent, milord. 
 And you are? 
 Inspector Stanford and Sergeant Brand, York Police. 
 Alfred can't have got into trouble with the police, that's not possible. 
 He's made a complaint concerning a Mr Thomas Barrow making an assault of a criminal nature on another of your employees. 
 That is a very serious allegation. 
 It is, milord. Serious enough to bring us here to interrupt your cricket match. 
 If you'd like to point out the young gentleman? 
 He's over... 
 I'll fetch him. 
 We'll go and... 
 I think it's better if you leave it to his Lordship. 
 I'm sure he can get to the bottom of it. 
 But I know what I saw, milord, and it weren't right. 
 I'm not asking you to abandon your beliefs, Alfred. 
 Just to introduce a little kindness into the equation. 
 Am I not to stand up against evil? 
 Evil? 
 Thomas does not choose to be the way he is, and what harm was done, really, that his life should be destroyed for it? 
 Well... 
 Let he who is without sin cast the first stone. 
 Are you without sin, Alfred? For I am certainly not. 
 Sorry about your son, Mr Molesley. 
 Don't be. 
 But he talked such a lovely game. 
 He could always talk a good game of cricket. He just couldn't play it. 
 Just as I thought. There's been a mix-up. 
 Alfred here witnessed some roughhousing between two of the staff and misinterpreted it. 
 But why did you make the telephone call without checking your facts? 
 I'm very much afraid to say he was a bit squiffy, weren't you, Alfred? 
 I made the call before I knew what I were doing. 
 I'd been at the cider. 
 You'd what? 
 Oh, I think we can overlook it this once. 
 Don't you, Carson? 
 So, you see, I'm afraid there's really nothing to investigate. 
 I am terribly sorry to have wasted your time. 
 Would you care to have some tea? 
 No, thank you, Lord Grantham. I think we've got the measure of it. 
 Good luck with your match. 
 Where's Nanny? 
 MARY: Gone to get some baby paraphernalia. 
 Shall I tell her you're looking for her? 
 No. 
 No, I'll be here anyway. 
 You're very good to play. 
 I don't know why I made such a fuss about it. 
 Can I ask you something? 
 Of course. 
 If I were to say I'd live with you while Sybbie's little, and that we wouldn't move out until she's older, would you mind? 
 I should be delighted. 
 And I know it's what Sybil would want. 
 I think you're right. 
 Tom says Robert's ready to get behind the plan. 
 I'm glad. 
 So we'll be building a new kingdom while we make our little prince. 
 I'm looking forward to both enormously 
 CLARKSON: Right gentlemen. Time's up. 
 We're about to start again. 
 I hope I can count on you not to laugh when I drop the ball. 
 You can always count on me. 
 I know that. 
 I didn't think it was possible to love as much as I love you. 
 Matthew, hurry up! You're keeping everyone waiting. 
 I've got to go. 
 Of course you have. 
 Tom seems to think you might be coming round. 
 He's brought me round more like. But, yes. All right. 
 Let's give it a go, and see what the future brings. 
 Thank you. 
 Catch it!
