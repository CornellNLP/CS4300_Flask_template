 You have hidden abilities, it seems. 
 You're thinking I could tutor you? 
 On the quiet. 
 Have you fallen so far from this family, Emma? 
 I once knew a doctor. His treatment was very imaginative. 
 Did you love him? 
 Do you love yours? 
 She's been sent home. 
 You must ride hard. 
 If not, she won't be there when you return. 
 I shall see you before long.

 Please, Chaplain, do something. 
 Help me. Chaplain. 
 The doctor has been summoned. 
 Please! 
 Help me. 
 [panting] 
 The Lord is my rock... my fortress and my deliver. 
 I don't want to die! 
 My God is my rock, in whom I take refuge. 
 Do something! 
 Shield and the horn of my salvation. 
 Do something! 
 [irish accent] Miss. I'm looking for the Matron! 
 Well, you'll find her about the wards. 
 Although, on a day like today, you'll likely to hear her first. 
 Digi-torum, membran-osus. Or is it -aris? 
 No, no. Longus. 
 Why is it that nothing beneath the skin sounds remotely the way it looks? 
 I tell you, all of human anatomy is its own Byzantine recherché. 
 Sorry, you were saying? 
 I have cut off more limbs than any other doctor in this war, and yet, I am forced to pass an exam given to me by a bunch of inkhorn surgeons. 
 It's an indignity. You're fine. 
 Well, you've been at the books day and night, so-- 
 Books! Books! Yes, books! In one eye and out the other. 
 My knife is guided by touch and feel, not some military manual. 
 McBurney has my brain in a pinch. 
 The major's not to blame. 
 You defend him, after he so callously sent Miss Phinney... 
 Oh, of course. Of course. 
 You hope to assume her position. 
 I resent the implication. 
 Still, you stand to benefit from her misfortunes. 
 Miss Phinney succumbed to an illness not a coup d'etat. 
 Her position must be filled. 
 Oh. 
 Therefore, my own advancement hangs in the balance, as does yours. 
 And yet, I remain fully composed. 
 Do I not? 
 Major McBurney has his job to do. 
 We have ours. 
 And what if I lose mine, hmm? 
 Byron, do not so easily fall prey to your own anxieties. 
 It is, how to say, not so alluring. 
 Samuel : Excuse me? 
 Miss Hastings, the Major would like to see you at once-- 
 "At once?" Is that his words precisely? 
 Good "At once" or bad "At once?" 
 I-I couldn't say, Miss. 
 That woman is wound tighter than a 10-day clock. 
 Come with me, Samuel. 
 Our transfemoral expired last night. 
 Seems awful sudden, sir. 
 Was there a hemorrhage? 
 Not that I can tell. 
 Sometimes a feeble disposition is the only culprit. 
 I'll have him moved to the dead room. 
 Samuel. Meet me there later. 
 Exam Preparation. 
 Perhaps a change of venue would be worthwhile. 
 We need a doctor! 
 He'll have to wait. 
 All of them are with patients. 
 Are you a doctor? 
 Yes, and a very busy one. 
 My buddy needs your help. 
 He needs my help, as does he, him, them. 
 Your friend's turn will come. 
 If he ain't dead first. 
 I'm sorry. I-I tried to tell him. 
 Hold these. 
 No distension. Bruising is curious. 
 From the horse, I reckon. 
 He was trampled? 
 No. Had to throw him over bareback to get him here from Germantown. 
 Difficult ride at night. 
 He'd do the same for me. 
 You left your Regiment? 
 Regiment got overrun. 
 We was killing face to face, but every last man got it some way or another, and I took Danny along. 
 The rest are still bleeding out there. 
 How old are you, son? 
 Born June 18th, '44. 
 I don't much like folk eyeballin' me, and now fix him! 
 Relax, soldier. You won. 
 Miss Green, find this man a bed. 
 What about the others? 
 Those men won't last much longer. 
 You got to tell somebody. 
 How many men, soldier? 
 20, 25. 
 Up past Ayres farmhouse. 
 Chaplain, it's already been a night. Buzzards will pick them apart. 
 Don't leave them out there to die. 
 Oh! Come, come. 
 Let's find you a bed. 
 Miss Hastings, I rather pride myself on my surgical efficiency. 
 We all take great pride-- 
 But that is not why I was dispatched to this hospital. 
 Well, obviously. 
 It is my administrative skills that were most needed here. 
 As such, I find it simply unconscionable that one tart should have three peach slices and the other 11. 
 11! 
 Surely you see the slippery slope. 
 Today, peaches. 
 Tomorrow, vital life-saving medical supplies. 
 How can a hospital properly function if it can't even count its... 
 ...peaches? 
 Let us not answer my question with your questions. 
 Peaches. 
 Precisely. 
 Any prospective head nurse would not tolerate such imprecision. 
 Sir, in my defense, the tart, as with all matters of nutrition, falls to the kitchen staff. 
 Well, now it falls to you. 
 Henceforth, I will expect all tart fruits to be notated by type and quantity. 
 I expect two peach tarts of exact and equal composition on my desk by 5:00.

 The minute hand makes a full circle for every hour, the hour hand for every day. 
 Why is it important for us to know how to tell time? 
 How do we know when it's time to go to work? 
 When the Overseer say it time. 
 [laughter] 
 You are your own overseers now. 
 Soon, you will have paying work, so you must oversee your own time. 
 [clears throat] 
 I gathered some books for you. 
 Samuel here is a free man from up north. 
 Born free. 
 Care to speak to the students? 
 Me? 
 [laughter] 
 Tell them about your work here. 
 Not much to tell. 
 I help out around the hospital, washing the floors, fixing what's broke. 
 Watching the doctors and learning what they know. 
 Samuel plans to become a doctor himself one day. 
 A Negro doctor? 
 They got those? 
 I won't be the first. 
 A man named David Jones Peck already did it. 
 He graduated from a white college. 
 And that was 15 years ago.

 It came this morning. 
 From a Mrs. Katrina Van Der Berg. 
 [scoffs] He was married? 
 [sighs] From his mother, I suspect. 
 I haven't opened it. 
 We had to defend ourselves. 
 I know, Jimmy, I know. 
 But that dreadful lawman... 
 Is gone. 
 Back to Washington City with McClellan. 
 Let's hope he stays by his master's side. 
 You needn't worry. 
 It's just me here. Must you go? 
 Someone has to tend the business while Father is off on holiday. 
 Your father is off trying to restore our reputation. 
 You of all people should understand that. 
 With some far-fetched plan to align the British Empire. 
 Judah Benjamin will laugh in his face. 
 He is doing what he can, Jimmy. 
 It is called diplomacy. 
 James : My business with Secretary Benjamin will take a few hours. 
 You go straight to Auntie Cora's and deliver those sweet cakes your mother baked. 
 We'll meet back at the hotel after supper. 
 Keep a close eye on her. 
 Yes, sir, Mr. Green.

 Driver, take us to the Old Tavern on Manchester. 
 We meant to go see your kinfolk. 
 Do as I say, Driver. 
 Miss Alice, your father told you to-- 
 If we stop en route, Belinda, Father will never know any different, will he? 
 Driver. 
 Man : Hyah. 
 Dr. Foster, do you require-- [sighs] 
 I am sorry that I was misleading about Miss Phinney's departure. 
 Deeply. 
 I had nothing to do with the decision. 
 I have said so many times. 
 Hand me some fresh lint, please. 
 I see you're a tad clenched. 
 Something the matter? 
 Have you any peaches? 
 Cook says we're out, and I must have peaches by 4:00. 
 How's he doing? 
 Laceration has been repaired, superficial at that. 
 This man should be on his feet, yet his pulse continues to weaken. 
 Respiration increasingly labored. 
 His condition is puzzling. 
 I swore to him that he'd be all right. 
 I know it was stupid to say. 
 Well, hope can be its own medicine. 
 If we start eliminating what isn't the cause, we may arrive at what is, hmm? 
 Oh, look. The French have arrived for work. 
 Is it noon already? 
 What is she doing here? 
 An anatomist, they say. 
 Apparently, you can add "-ist" to the end of any old thing and call yourself an expert. 
 I plan the piano. 
 That doesn't make me a pianist, does it? 
 And that dress. 
 However did she get past the flagpole without being hoisted up it? 
 Hello, Jed. 
 Mademoiselle. 
 Please. I prefer "Lisette." 
 And I prefer "Dr. Foster." 
 I see you two have been previously acquainted. 
 Well, then.  Au revoir. 
 Funny. 
 This great big war, so many hospitals, and you show up at this one. 
 Imagine my surprise. 
 Had I known you'd be here, I would have brought the coat you left on my hook. 
 Three years ago. 
 I've moved on to a new coat. 
 You're married, I understand? 
 Yes. Our arrangement is a much contented one, thank you. 
 That's an interesting choice of words. 
 Contented? 
 Arrangement. 
 [moaning in distance] 
 Quite a chaotic morning, no? 
 And down a head nurse to boot. 
 I've met her. 
 She wanted you to have this. 
 [coughs] 
 He's awake! 
 Aimes? 
 I'm here, Danny. 
 Do something, Doctor! 
 What ails him? 
 Not certain, but the cough is new. 
 Blood. 
 This is concerning, but it might tells us what is wrong with him. 
 Pipe down, all of you before I take out my belt! 
 You think the Rebs cause all the pain around here? 
 Well, keep this up, and you'll find out different. 
 Get away. 
 Go easy on 'em, Matron. 
 Lads will be lads. 
 Oh, Declan! Darling! 
 What in God's name are you doing here? 
 Oh, dressed up like that? 
 Oh, you haven't been court-martialed, have you? 
 Can't a boy come visit his mum? 
 Oh! 
 Oh, I can feel your ribs. 
 Wagons? You want wagons? 
 Yes. Four or five should do. 
 Oh, why not 10 or 100? 
 Those men are out there. 
 Yes, says one man. Injured at that. Could be the ether talking. 
 And if not, we leave them out there to die. 
 Out there's not my problem. I'm in enough trouble in here. 
 Major, I must implore you-- 
 Your work is at the bedside, Chaplain, not on the battlefield. 
 What will become of us if we are each doing a job other than our own? 
 If the artillery men cooked and the cooks fired the artillery, this war would be lost in a week! 
 Is that my sole purpose in this war? 
 To parrot Bible verses? 
 It's vital work. 
 God's word brings the men peace. 
 Or brings me peace. 
 Gives me the illusion that I'm actually doing something to help these men. 
 I'll rescue them myself. 
 Chaplain, you have faith, courage, resolve, but what means have you to procure those wagons? 
 I'll speak to the teamsters, make an appeal to their conscience. 
 I'm sure that many-- some, at least-- will volunteer. 
 Or I can provide the money, and you'll have as many wagons as you need. 
 If you allow me to go with you. 
 Brought a new text. 
 No doubt it's the best yet on the subject. 
 Oh, Gray's Anatomy. Fascinating detail. 
 Beautiful illustrations. 
 Who needs a book when we have the real thing? 
 Cause of death was indeterminate. 
 Surely an investigation is justified. 
 You propose an autopsy? 
 You've done one before. 
 In Philadelphia, I assisted Dr. Berenson. 
 So shall you assist me. 
 And you will point out the gaps in my knowledge. 
 Unless you'd rather be fixing a leak somewhere. 
 No, sir. 
 Very good. 
 Where shall we begin-- head, stump? 
 Ooh, heart. 
 [knocks on door] 
 Enter. 
 Is that a Beck Brothers microscope? 
 Been in the box for two weeks. 
 Like a toy on Christmas morning. 
 This patient's case presents an opportunity to finally unwrap it. 
 I worked with a similar one in Geneva. 
 I was asked to develop a method for photographing the slides. 
 You intend to examine the sputum. 
 Mm. 
 I can prepare a suitable diatom to help you calibrate it. 
 If you wish. 
 I think we may have gotten off, how do you say, the wrong leg? 
 It's hard to say know what would be the right leg with you. 
 You are still angry about the Earl. 
 Hmm, I thought he was a Count. 
 We are not children. You knew who I was. 
 In truth, I thought you had changed during those brief few months. 
 Well, I might have had you asked, but you know don't know how, do you? 
 To ask for what you want? 
 So instead you run away to your "arrangement." 
 If you must know, we're annulling. 
 By telegraph. It's all very modern. 
 Trust me, you haven't lived until you've quarreled in Morse Code. 
 And Miss Phinney? You were close? 
 Our arrangement was a professional one. 
 There's that word again. 
 Is the objective the right one? 
 [knob licking] 
 Yes. 
 This does clarify things. 
 Shall I prepare the specimen? 
 Thank you, Mademoiselle. 
 But I think I can take it from here.

 Good chance I won't make it to noon. 
 Unless... 
 [scoffs] Never mind. 
 Unless what? Spit it out, boy! 
 Unless I were to have a deferment. 
 Deferment? From what? 
 From my regiment to another. 
 Surveyors, quartermaster-- 
 On what grounds? 
 Epilepsy, asthma, hemorrhoids-- anything! 
 As long as the surgeon signs for it. 
 Ma, the Colonel is mad. 
 It's senseless. 
 If I go, I'll die. 
 And if you don't, some other mother's son will go in your place. 
 But not  your  son.

 Banfield : Furniture? 
 Green factory bread and butter for the last 30 years. 
 Parts arrived disassembled. 
 Bed rails, brass headboard rods, various hardware. 
 Larkin : A rifle? 
 A little prototype I rigged up. 
 We can buy guns from as far away as Europe. 
 Yankee inspectors will never know. 
 Green, that's a pretty good ruse.

 Your friend has a parasite in his sputum. Larva. 
 I don't understand. 
 Eggs in his lungs... 
 His bowels, likely. It's an infestation. 
 I've never seen it before, but I'm certain it's what ails him. 
 Is there a cure? 
 None on record. I could guess at one. 
 Oil of turpentine, sulfate of magnesia, and a mercurial. 
 He'd have to drink it. 
 It may kill him, but at this rate, well... 
 I'll prepare the compound. 
 That was a bit cold, no? 
 Where is the compassionate physician I used to know? 
 There's something wrong with those boys. 
 I believe they are deviants. 
 Deviants? 
 Mm.

 Sir, I know that you have been trying to court the British into the war on our side, and I have come with a plan that I believe may make it possible. 
 You have a plan to bring the British in? 
 Yes, sir. So if you'll allow me to-- 
 Yeah, but before you begin, I must inquire, sir, as to why you are  really  here. 
 To help with our cause, of course. 
 Do you suspect some other motive? 
 Well, your son did sign an oath of allegiance to the Union? 
 I assure you, he only did so in order to free me from prison. 
 You were released by executive order, I believe. 
 Yes, signed personally by um, oh, uh, now--

 And you are in love with him. 
 You must tell him. 
 Lisette, that man is very sick-- 
 I wouldn't want to distress him none. 
 He might not make it through the night. 
 All the more reason. 
 You have to show him who you really are. 
 If you don't, you'll regret it as long as you live.

 Secretary Benjamin, please allow me to tell you this plan. 
 Oh, dear. Very well. 
 From here to the door, you may make your case. 
 Next week, a British envoy will be quartered in my home. 
 A guest of the Union. 
 Now, I seek permission to lobby him on our behalf. 
 Mr. Green, I have already tried to appeal to the British conscience. 
 Well, then, we must appeal to their purse strings. 
 The price of raw cotton has increased several hundred percent since the blockade. 
 Liverpool, Manchester-- factories are closing, workers are being sent home by the thousands. 
 Common knowledge. 
 I have gathered a collective of cotton growers who have agreed to sell their considerable surplus at a cut rate and guarantee that rate a decade hence if England comes in on our side! 
 Cotton diplomacy? 
 Indeed. 
 It may not win this war, but British intervention will at least get us to a stalemate, one in which  you  can negotiate a peace from a point of leverage. 
 Before we run it by President Davis, you must certify your sincerity. 
 I will lay my hand on a Bible. 
 New Testament or Old. 
 I know you were of the Israelite faith. 
 I'm many things, sir, but a man is defined by the one thing that he's willing to kill or to die for. 
 In that regard, I am a Southerner first. 
 I fight for my home. 
 Each man must make his own sense of this war. 
 On that, we do agree. 
 So now... what are you, Mr. Green, above all else? 
 Above all? 
 I am a father who simply wants his children to grow up in peace. 
 I hate to think of my parents worrying. 
 We'll go again at first light. 
 They'll understand. 
 You don't know my parents. 
 If they saw what I saw, I'm quite sure they would be proud. 
 Emma.

 How'd you sleep? 
 I feel completely... un-clenched. 
 Just think how you'd feel the third time around. 
 Lieutenant, I must report to the ward. 
 The wounded will wonder. 
 Perhaps on your next visit. 
 Perhaps. 
 Though, if I make it here again, I'll likely be a patient. 
 What do you mean? 
 Well, you heard. 
 Rebs are moving into Maryland. 
 I'm apt to be killed in the first wave. 
 Unless you reconsider that deferment. 
 What deferment? 
 The Matron never asked? 
 Lieutenant, was this merely a ploy to obtain a medical deferment? 
 A ploy to move me closer to Alexandria and the insatiable... soon-to-be permanent Head Nurse of a certain hospital. 
 Where would you rather have me-- alive in your bed or dead in a coffin? 
 Intriguing quandary. 
 Mm. 
 Perhaps I could use a little more persuasion. 
 Mm.
