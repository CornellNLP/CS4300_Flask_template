 I'm miss Phinney. 
 Poor thing was recently widowed... 
 Yes, Dr. Hale, I'm aware. 
 No need to be ashamed of your inexperience. 
 Emma : This is my family's hotel. 
 You  are the one who doesn't belong. 
 Rent is payable upon your pledging the loyalty oath. 
 Ah, that's a pesky thing, isn't it? 
 This will not be tolerated. It was not a surgical procedure. 
 Your authorization was not required. 
 I got you something. 
 A bird. 
 For when you want to fly away. 
 I demand you get to all of these men. 
 We have started building coffins. 
 We got bodies. They got boxes. 
 You've no idea what you're signing up for, do you?

 I never put much stock in the Greeks. 
 Let me guess. You're miffed with me. 
 I saw you yesterday with the federals, you and brother. 
 It saddens me to think that the men in this family... 
 That you would... 
 That we would what? 
 If we are not loyal to the confederacy, father, then we are traitors. 
 Is that not so? 
 I am loyal to the confederacy. 
 By doing business with the enemy? 
 We're not doing business with them... 
 And commiserating with these invaders? 
 We are putting them in boxes!

 I have every faith that, before long, these blue bastards will smell Southern powder and feel Southern steel. 
 In the meantime, I will not allow everything that I have built and everything your grandfather and his father built to be taken away, destroyed.

 You're young. 
 Absolute. 
 Someday, you'll see the world in more than two colors.

 Jane : My goodness. 
 This rebelliousness, where does it come from? 
 I've been told it's in my blood. 
 You raised us to be charitable and to care for the less fortunate. 
 What better way to do that than by ministering to our wounded boys? 
 Your father and I will discuss it. 
 And today?

 I must have a red ribbon. I have white already. 
 It's weathered, but it'll do, and I need red, because red... 
 Red and white is what the girls have decided to wear as a secret sign of support for the rebellion.

 It also goes with your favorite dress. 
 Well, I may have had some influence over the color choice.

 But, miss, I...

 That leg is army-issued, which means you are stealing from the United States government.

 We all got our burdens to bear. 
 At least you got two legs to bear it on. 
 May I help you? Um, yes, miss, if you would. 
 Um, I'm, uh... My name is... 
 This is Mr. Percival Squivers, a volunteer cadet from the medical academy. 
 This is miss Phinney. 
 I'm meant to observe and offer what assistance I can. Thank you. 
 Gonna fix this place right up, ain't that so, Mr. Squivers? 
 I have two years as apprentice under Dr. Pelham of Fredericksburg and a year at the academy. 
 Oh, well, no need to impress me, Mr. Squivers. 
 It says here you already have the job. 
 Yes, of course. Thank you. 
 I'm told to report to, uh... 
 Dr. Hale? 
 Yes, precisely. Thank you. 
 Stop thanking me, Mr. Squivers.

 Thank you, nurse Mary.

 Been here three days, and we're short on beds. 
 Yes, I know. I... 
 You're to be the queen of all nurses, you'll need to keep up.

 No, you wouldn't. 
 But alas, I would.

 Miss Hastings! 
 Little miss hoity-toity. 
 Miss Hastings! 
 Anne : Yes, matron Brannan? 
 Do ask the good doctor if he might grace us with his presence in the ward.

 I-I'm sorry. I... 
 Rest now, corporal. 
 I'll be back to see you soon. 
 Um... 
 [Chuckles] Yes. 
 Uh, I'll just wait over here. Thank you. 
 Who's the beanpole? 
 Mr. Squivers, a medical cadet. 
 Hmm. 
 I had some reservations about Dr. Hale's assessment. 
 Did you? 
 I did. 
 Mm. 
 And I felt I could no longer wait... 
 How forward. 
 Is that how miss Dix instructs her nurses to behave? 
 I hope we have not gotten off on the wrong foot. 
 The corporal has a condition known as expressive aphemia. 
 I'm not familiar with that. 
 A fellow in France named Pierre Paul Broca has been studying brain function. 
 I worked with him before the war. 
 He's had a number of patients like this man, Kilner... 
 Skull wounds followed by aphemia... 
 Who turned out to have convolutions of the brain, requiring... 
 Requiring you to unhand my patient. 
 Dr. Hale. 
 Ah, nurse Mary, how do you do? 
 I mean, uh, most disappointed, baroness. 
 Most disappointed. 
 Pardon? 
 This man has a mild, superficial laceration. 
 His symptoms, such as they are, the chattery gobbledygook, et cetera, are manufactured. 
 A cowardly malingerer, he should be shipped back to the nearest battlefield as soon as his ailment has healed if not before. 
 Before  he is healed? 
 I believe he has a neurological deficit that may require trephination and draining. 
 [Laughs] Are you serious, man? 
 Do you think he also has evil spirits that need to be released? 
 Surely, you are aware of the... 
 Oh, I'm aware. 
 I am also aware of unicorns and mermaids. 
 But I'm beginning to wonder, Dr. foster, if  you  are the one with the deficit. 
 Uh, are you aware of his breath? 
 Whiskey. 
 Excuse us. 
 And, miss Phinney, many of the men have not been fed since yesterday. 
 We need to see to that. 
 Yes, doctor. 
 The French have determined... 
 Oh, we look to the French now, do we? 
 They eat frogs, you know. 
 Uh, so do we, I believe. 
 Miss Phinney! Here we go. 
 Where is that, exactly? 
 To your meeting. 
 My what, sir? 
 Oh, yes, I've been directed to arrange one by your good friend, the dragon, miss Dix. 
 A meeting? Not surprising, knowing miss Dix's fondness for hot air and hierarchy. 
 She is the wife no man ever wanted. 
 Dr. Foster : You need to acquaint yourself with current theories of... 
 I am well-acquainted, but I see no reason to put a hole in that man's head when what he needs is a kick in the ass back to the nearest battlefield. 
 Then allow me to do the procedure. 
 I will not. 
 You are not authorized to do a trephination. 
 Not on him, and not on a coconut. 
 Look, don't we want the same thing, hmm? 
 What's best for the patient? 
 Speak to me not in riddles, man. 
 Leave him be. 
 You should not have intervened in the first place. 
 Ladies, it is my intention to bring all of our needs and goals together and give voice to the nursing staff as a group. 
 Anne : Have you nursed before? 
 Aside from a few screeching nephews and your dead husband? 
 I have no claim to expertise. 
 But I have been charged with overseeing the nursing in this hospital, and I am eager and capable to do that. 
 Making sure that we do the best job possible together to provide the finest treatment for the boys. 
 Yes, but why you? 
 I petitioned miss Dix for placement. She sent me here. 
 Anyone else who would like to go to her to become an official army nurse is also free to do so. 
 Uh... 
 Miss Green? 
 This is the nurses' meeting? 
 Union  nurses, miss. 
 The confederate boys are patients. 
 I'm their nurse. 
 Please. Proceed. 
 I intend to address a wide array of matters... 
 Diet, letter writing, attending to the doctors as they need help. 
 I would ask that you, miss Hastings, be charged with training us all in wound dressing as you are so clearly expert at it. 
 I have a question, miss Phinney. 
 Will you see to it that the confederate boys are treated fairly and equally? 
 Dr. Summers : [Clears throat] 
 Pardon me, Your Eminence. I see you've got this under control. 
 Miss Green, you are a volunteer, allowed to be here only by the good graces of the United States... 
 That's all right, matron. 
 As long as they are here, we will do our best for them. 
 But I will not lie to you. 
 Never at the expense of a union soldier. 
 Hmmph! 
 That is cold comfort, miss. 
 It is, isn't it? Quite cold.

 Ah, nurse Mary, you are found. 
 Did you meet with Dr. Hale? 
 He said to stick by your side. 
 Bully for me. 
 Matron, I noted, as did Dr. Foster in his inimitably collegial way, that the morning meals were late and sparse. 
 Were they now? 
 I wonder if it would not be too forward of me to offer my perspective on the dietary need. 
 The steward, Mr. Bullen, does as he deems fit, given the challenges and supplies at hand. 
 I understand. 
 You've got God and miss Dix on your side, dear. 
 Do as you deem fit.

 Yes, I do. 
 No. No, you don't.

 Death house? It's the mansion house hotel.

 Miss Hastings, I assure you, I respect and admire your experience. 
 My experience? 
 And I look forward to learning from your many years of... 
 I am not old, madam! 
 I only mean, I want what's best for the boys, as do you, as you did in the Crimea with miss Nightingale. 
 You have a silvery tongue, baroness Von Olnhausen. 
 But Dix or no Dix, I am the senior nurse in this hospital, and I'll not be done in by some Dutch widow with a twinkle in her eye. 
 Miss Hastings? 
 Please. May I call you Anne? 
 I understand. 
 This has been your roost to rule until now, and I have interfered with that. 
 That was not my intention. 
 And if, as I suspect, your temper is because you feel your identity as a nurse is all you have in this life, well, so do I. 
 We are the same in that way. 
 We are women in a man's world. 
 Let us not make enemies of each other.

 What a heroic maneuver today. 
 Oh. Thank you, miss Hastings. 
 Are you in pain? Here, allow me. 
 You're so devoted to the men, so committed to taking care of them, but who takes care of  you ? 
 Well, my wife makes a go of it. 
 Of course. Of course, she does. 
 Dr. Foster? 
 Dr. Summers would see you now. 
 "Flouted procedure, et cetera. 
 Engaged in unauthorized and inappropriate procedure. 
 Refused to perform others in keeping with regulation." 
 Naughty, naughty surgeon. 
 You have not been playing well with some of your commissioned colleagues. 
 Dr. Hale has a way of bringing out the best in me. 
 He's prepared to submit this to the surgeon general. 
 My contract's finished next week, sir. 
 If you'll allow me to complete my term... 
 I will not. 
 I want more. 
 I want you to stay beyond it. 
 Uncivilized environment, hopeless wounds, incompetent support, an excess of work, paltry compensation. 
 We offer every enticement. 
 [Chuckles] 
 But an unparalleled medical opportunity. 
 I won't deny that part of me wants to stay on. 
 There's work to do here, work that matters. 
 But Hale's right. 
 Eh. I-I'm not military material. 
 I bristle at the restrictions, the hierarchy, the regulations. 
 Oh, good. 
 I'm sick of parrots and lemmings, so is surgeon general Hammond. 
 That's why he's instituted a more stringent medical exam. 
 Take the test, continue on as a full-fledged military doctor. 
 But there are other factors, sir. 
 My wife, Eliza... 
 Oh. There's always a wife. 
 I promised her we'd go out west. 
 She's got family near Redwood City. 
 Is that what you want, curing rich people's runny noses in California? 
 I don't believe I can persuade her to stay in Alexandria. 
 That's not what I asked. 
 Well, think on it. 
 How's that brother of yours? 
 Evan, was it? 
 Ezra. 
 Mm. Furloughed, or is he in it now? 
 In it, fighting on the peninsula. 
 Godspeed to him. 
 Oh! Miss Green, I'm sorry, I didn't... 
 Be more observant. I will. 
 I will be extremely observant of you in the future. 
 I hope you find the accommodations suitable. 
 They're more suitable every day. 
 The opposite is true for me. 
 Ah, well, you must let me know how I might be of service. 
 Uh, you're gonna pull that right out of your head. 
 [Chuckles] Have you no ribbon? 
 I could perhaps find you some in town. 
 I have some still. 
 You have not impoverished us quite yet. 
 Red would be fetching. 
 [Thud] 
 I'm sorry if I made you mad. 
 Best to keep to myself. 
 Ain't nothing against you. 
 I don't know much, but I do know what hurt looks like. 
 And one thing about hurting is, it's best not to do it alone. 
 No. 
 Oh, here, here. 
 Don't! 
 You can't. 
 Sammy, get back out there, boy. 
 Work to be done.

 Tom : "Dearest Alice, this is the seventh letter I've written to you but all remain unsent. 
 No mail goes out, nor comes in now. 
 This distance makes my heart ache. 
 Until I came to the peninsula, I did not know fear, and war was but an idea. 
 But now, it is both fearful and real, and like nothing you could ever imagine or should." 
 [Voice breaking] Why do you have his things? 
 He's dead, isn't he? 
 My Tom is dead. 
 That chicken guts is right about one thing. 
 We need to worry about ourselves now. 
 Sad when conscience becomes a luxury we can no longer afford.

 Back down where you came from. 
 Please, sir. My wife and young'uns are just across town, waiting for me to come home.

 Dr. Foster's probably got caught up at the hospital. 
 He'll come, Jenny. 
 He'll come. 
 Did you forget or simply choose a higher priority? 
 I am sorry, Eliza. 
 Every time I think I can leave, something prevents me. 
 You promised. We need to plan our travel. 
 Yes, yes, but there is something else to discuss. 
 Dr. Summers... He has asked me to stay on. 
 And my experiments, I-I feel optimistic. 
 I may be discovering things which could help people. 
 We all have a purpose. 
 Maybe mine was to be here, saving lives. 
 Pardon me. 
 I have been patient, Jed. 
 I have waited, made sacrifices, all based on our agreement. 
 You can't betray that now. 
 Not if this marriage is truly the partnership you have promised me. 
 These are turbulent times, Eliza. 
 We need to be open to change. 
 I am not open to it! I repudiate it! 
 Stop that now, miss Phinney. 
 I found a place for you in one of the upstairs rooms. 
 It's reserved for visiting families of patients, but it's free. 
 You've earned a decent night's rest. 
 So as your wife, I am telling you, you must choose, what is more important... 
 This marriage or this war? 
 If I don't have an answer by the morning, I will leave without you.

 What plans? 
 Wedding plans. 
 Oh, you mustn't tell. It's our deep, dark secret.
