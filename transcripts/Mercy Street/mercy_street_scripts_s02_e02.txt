 There's a Union officer lodging at your home. 
 He has documents. 
 You took the oath? 
 Why would you do it? 
 To get you out of jail. 
 The medical department will be sending my replacement. 
 You've had an effect on me. 
 The society dispatched me here to help acclimate those making the transition to freedom. 
 Mary : There are desperately ill people out there. 
 You are angry about something. 
 I am angry about who you pretend to be. 
 Telegram came from Boston. 
 I bought this. Steamer leaves Tuesday. 
 That man there, he's looking for Aurelia Johnson. 
 I know you. 
 Find him!

 Got none to sell. 
 Well, I see some 40 bushels. 
 But not provender for oath signers. 
 Pardon me? What did you say? 
 Come on, Miss Emma. 
 Man bring bushels to the hospital. 
 He'll have enough for us.

 Doesn't need to. 
 For people who toiled in the fields and only know sunup and sundown, it'll serve to teach them how time works. 
 Take care of everything, don't you? 
 Somebody helped me learn how to be free once. 
 Now I aim to do the same for others. 
 When you headed north? 
 Tomorrow. 
 Curious why you'd want to leave now with emancipation right around the corner. 
 Should think you'd want to be around to see that. 
 I have a girl in Massachusetts. 
 You fixin' to marry her? 
 Well, far be it from me to keep people who love each other apart. 
 Caleb : Miss Charlotte. 
 I'm taking him to the administration office. 
 I heard they might have a record of job placements for former slaves. 
 Never heard of records like that. 
 If she was working in Alexandria, they might be able to tell us where. 
 There's just no way of knowing if his story is even true. 
 Why would he lie? 
 I got to get back in the tent. 
 Lunch isn't till noon, I hear.

 I sent you the full accounts. 
 You had time to review them? 
 It appears that our business is no worse off than when I was arrested. 
 What's more, there are new opportunities beyond coffin making. 
 Is that so? 
 Army wagons roll through this town night and day, constantly breaking cartwheels and spokes. 
 I'm meeting today with the Provost Marshal to see what their needs may be. 
 Wagon supplies? 
 With his approval, we can reopen the warehouse. 
 You set this meeting without consulting me? 
 You were still in jail, Father. 
 Well, I'm out of jail now, so I'll see it myself. 
 Your presence would be problematic. 
 Problematic? 
 You're not allowed to run the business. 
 Why? Because you signed the oath? 
 And because you did not. 
 Your father owns the business, Jimmy. 
 Not you. 
 Yes. Of course. 
 Mm-hmm. 
 But under their law, he can only function as a silent partner for now. 
 And I'm to be what, grateful? 
 To them? To you? 
 Federals are in retreat. 
 McClellan is an embarrassment. 
 This occupation will soon be over. 
 Stay away from him, Alice. He's a danger to us. 
 And what if he's caught? 
 He'll be hanged. 
 For what? Being a patriot? 
 For trying to kill a man. 
 Let Frank take care of himself. 
 Morning, ladies. 
 Pardon me. I... 
 Something the matter, Captain? 
 Well... yes. 
 You have been most gracious hosts, but a small item's gone missing from my room. 
 Missing? 
 Official paperwork. 
 Some technical notes of no value to anyone outside the military. 
 Oh. Well, the servants, on occasion, in an effort to keep things tidy, mistakenly discard things. 
 They do? 
 When have they done that? 
 I will talk to them. 
 The papers were in a leather case. 
 Difficult to mistake for rubbish. 
 Perhaps they moved them somewhere. 
 Go, sister. I will attend to this. 
 I'll have the rubbish searched. 
 It sometimes sits around for days, so I imagine we're not too late. 
 [Sighs] Very well, then. 
 Thank you. 
 I must be off to the stables now. 
 My horses have arrived from up north. 
 Oh, have they? How wonderful. 
 I do love to ride. 
 My father taught me when I was only little. 
 He used to take us... 
 James. 
 If we are not careful, our girls will end up betrothed to these houseguests. 
 James. 
 I intend to write the Provost Marshal on the unfairness of disenfranchising a man from a business he built from nothing. 
 But passes on to his son. 
 Per force. 
 We are struggling in the aftermath of a decision you made. 
 A noble decision, but Jimmy is rising from that struggle to his manhood, and I say thank goodness for it. 
 He is rising, and I am sinking. 
 Into what? 
 Obsolescence? 
 None of it is fair, my dear, but it is not Jimmy's fault or Alice's or Emma's. 
 We must channel our frustrations against the external forces that are opposing us, not within our home. 
 Not against each other.

 Seemed quite resolved to me. 
 Are you unwell?

 Yes.

 No.

 It's a good sign when anything gets stiff.

 Precisely. 
 The Exhilarator can even restore flaccid fifth limbs to full rigidity. 
 Fire up them electrodes, doc. 
 My fifth limb's a-waitin'.

 Firing them up now. 
 Ahh. 
 All in good time. 
 Conditions of great urgency await my treatment. 
 I'll return soon. 
 Woman : Hold still. 
 Sister Isabella. 
 Inform the nurses of a staff meeting this afternoon of some importance. 
 Yes, Miss Mary. 
 Miss Hastings, with our steward on the mend, I'd like an hourly check on the status of meals. 
 There's been a new cook added from the household of Miss Green. 
 Yes. My family's servant Belinda will be working here on occasion. 
 Perhaps Miss Green is better suited to task the kitchen staff. 
 Miss Green is still learning, whereas you, Miss Hastings, by virtue of your innate sense of authority, are well-suited to task those of any station. 
 And staff conferences with the new chief begin today. 
 We must be prepared to help steer the ship. 
 [Coughing] 
 I'm trembling. I've always been so rock steady. 
 But this... this b*st*rd, this swine! 
 Shh! 
 Major McBurney... you seen him? What did he say? 
 He read. I stood before him. 
 He sat there reading, never once gracing me with eye contact. 
 Oh, humiliation was his purpose. 
 And, oh, it was served. 
 Reading what? Start making sense. 
 A report by Summers describing me as earnest, eager, capable, but lacking passion or vision. 
 A damning legacy. 
 McBurney looked at me like I was the corpse of a man whose death he bet on. 
 Foster's in there with him now. 
 I'm sure his star soars heavenward. 
 [Sighs] 
 You're described as a man of some promise, Dr. Foster, who furthered an American education with study in Europe. 
 French medical methods are often seen as more advanced than our own. 
 I'm glad to describe some... 
 No need. 
 Would you like me to have a look at that, sir? 
 At what? 
 Your, uh... 
 You've risen fast. 
 Civilian to Captain to Executive Officer. 
 You make the ranks seem an easy game. 
 All in the service of my one true interest, medical... 
 Here's the rub, though. You do not like rules. 
 You do not follow them. 
 I'm a doctor from a strong military background. 
 I trained at the Jarvis Academy before my time at Princeton. 
 You are familiar with Princeton, are you not? 
 And I served on the field of battle until quite recently. 
 Last at Bull Run. 
 A year ago? 
 Point being... 
 Major Summers was generous to grant you latitude. 
 I, on the other hand, am not so... magnanimous. 
 I expect adherence to regulation. 
 Are we understood? 
 And henceforth, I will expect a proper salute, Captain. 
 [Door opens, closes] 
 Where are you from, Corporal? 
 Concord, Massachusetts. 
 Is that so? I am, as well. 
 I heard Mr. Douglass speak about his life as a slave. 
 He drove me to want to support the cause. 
 We have that inspiration in common. 
 Only now I know that one brutality don't make up for another. 
 All I seen is the worst men can do, and the worst of it is... we're losing this war. 
 You no longer believe in the cause? 
 Can you extend your leg, soldier? 
 [Grunts] 
 Are you able to flex the foot? 
 [Inhales sharply] 
 [Grunts] 
 His wounds have healed, but his recovery seems to be at an impasse. 
 So they keep shunting me around from one death house to another. 
 We'll find what's holding you back. 
 [Sighs] 
 Something internal, perhaps? 
 A lost fragment spreading toxin? 
 Or he's a malingerer. 
 I don't think so. He clearly doesn't want to be here. 
 No, he wants to be sent home. 
 I doubt that. There's more to it than simple evasion. 
 Trust her, Dr. Hale. 
 Miss Phinney is an expert on evasion. 
 Pardon me. I'm needed upstairs. 
 Evasion, huh? 
 [Man clears throat] 
 Um, may I? 
 I-I know that you have recently met with our new chief, and by the hypostasis of my own meeting with him, I, uh... 
 I hope there's been no abridgment in your newfound confidence in my abilities. 
 How we proceed has only to do with favoring a conservative approach, not my confidence in you. 
 Of course not. I'm sorry. I'm... 
 McBurney has my brain a little pinched. 
 Well, we are one in that. 
 He seems to have come loaded for bear. 
 Mm. 
 "Possessed of skills learned during service in the Crimea." 
 Miss Hastings exploits what authority she has. 
 "Officious, discompassionate, tyrannical." 
 Is not one man's tyrannical another man's... leaderly? 
 Indeed. 
 What may have been perceived as flaws I may view as attributes. 
 I do not see order here, Miss Hastings. 
 Being recently exalted, I am easy prey to deception without someone who can reveal to me the true nature of things. 
 I have taken lifelong pride in speaking of things as they are. 
 Perhaps that quality was undervalued by the previous regime. 
 Trust in me would not be, uh, misplaced. 
 As I suspected. 
 Now, Miss Phinney... what is her level of competence? 
 Miss Phinney? 
 Head nurse. How do you find her? 
 That is for you to determine, sir. 
 Would it even be fair of me to opine as... having worked alongside Miss Nightingale, my standards are... well, so... impossibly high. 
 Hmm. 
 Grab that pin for me. 
 Heard talk you were leaving to be with her. 
 The one I wronged. 
 The Lord has taken the scales from my eyes and I'm beholden to this debt. 
 You talking to your friend? 
 The Lord is my friend. 
 You seen Miss Charlotte? 
 She ain't around right now. 
 Well, this here food for the folks in the pox house. 
 A Godly thing. 
 Take it to them.

 Y-Yes, yes, she's to use the salve after each bath.

 The new chief requests your presence, Miss Phinney. 
 Perhaps this liniment will help.

 He defines the word "gentleman." 
 At the meeting this afternoon, I should like to discuss some new directives. 
 I've been giving our system quite a bit of thought... 
 Yes, yes, all in good time. 
 See how it goes with the Major first.

 The man there showed us a record of travel papers issued to an Aurelia Johnson. 
 She was headed up north like you.

 When we asked that steward, he said he never heard of her. 
 So I'd expect a white man not to know one runaway from another. 
 You ever think this Caleb might have bad intentions? 
 No. 
 He could be working for a slave catcher for all we know. 
 A black man working for a slave catcher? 
 I've heard things. 
 Why would you ever think that? 
 'Cause she never mentioned leaving a man behind. 
 So you do know her? 
 That man's been in chains his entire life. 
 Only now is he finally tasting freedom. 
 What's the lesson he'll learn if the first thing that happens is being lied to by one of his own color?

 Bully for you. 
 I hope that you enjoy every comfort here. 
 Your daughter Alice has been most generous, sir, in helping me to acclimate, learn about the local riding trails. 
 I know how glad she is to have you home. 
 Have you been riding with her? 
 No, sir, no. 
 She merely described places where I might enjoy to ride. 
 That table was brought back from China as a gift from Mrs. Green's father. 
 She's quite fond of it. 
 And we do not smoke in this room. 
 Miss Green. Time for the meeting. 
 And you, confidence man. 
 If you get gone within five minutes and swear never to come back, I'll turn a blind eye to you. 
 Corporal, Miss Phinney will ask after you. 
 What shall I tell her? 
 Tell her I appreciate her kindness, and that the nurse she sent as her emissary is... almost her equal. 
 I'll be nearby if you need me. 
 Wait! 
 Chaplain. 
 Something's happening. 
 Lord in heaven. 
 I'm rich.

 [Sighs] 
 Let me cheer you with some news. 
 The young man from Concord. 
 My abolitionist brother. 
 He has regained feeling in his leg. 
 What was the trouble? 
 All in his mind. 
 We implemented a nostrum, a placebo first utilized by Haygarth in 1799 to test a treatment known as Perkin's tractors. 
 Please, Jed, not now. 
 [Chuckles] 
 Ah... He needed to feel that he mattered. 
 And we, by which I mean you, made sure that happened. 
 As for you, if it's typhoid, the fever will come and go with severe joint pain from inflammation. 
 It may last weeks or even... 
 Months. 
 Yes, that much I know. 
 I'll be nothing but a burden. 
 Being hard on yourself will do nothing to speed your recovery. 
 Therefore I forbid such talk. 
 Now, let me take your pulse.

 "Musculature of the face and jaw." 
 Went to your room but the door was locked. 
 I was not there. 
 I see that. 
 Perhaps later? 
 Can you name the muscles of the face and jaw? 
 When you can, come see me. 
 [Chuckles] 
 Oh, I'm being punished for being forced to take an exam. 
 Not punished... motivated. 
 Pardon me now. The new chief awaits me. 
 [Knock on door] 
 Come in, Miss Hastings. 
 Would you please? 
 [Sighs] 
 Quite a day. 
 Much to be done. 
 Doctors to reprimand and correct, nursing staffs to organize. 
 But we shall persevere. 
 [Inhales sharply] 
 Am I hurting you? 
 No. 
 You have the hands of an angel. 
 How did you receive this scar, sir? 
 Ah. 
 Should I? Could I? Do I dare? 
 Tasked with establishing a field hospital outside Manassas. 
 I knew there was fire in the distance, but I was sure we could finish before they got too close. 
 Then as I was looking one way, boom. 
 Cannon fire. 
 The man standing next to me, a mute imbecile from Ohio, had lost all his front teeth to a mule kick. 
 [Chuckles] Well, a cannonball completely opened up the top of his head. 
 He was, well, instantly deceased. 
 But what's funny... [Grunts] 
 Unusual... I mean, of relevance is that bone fragments from his shattered skull flew off, lodged in my cheek, singeing deep into my flesh. 
 I could feel them scrape against my molar. 
 So, I was asked to take time away from battle for a small spell. 
 But soon enough, Miss Hastings, with you and God on my side, I will whip this place into shape and be back at the front before the killing is done. 
 With your fellow officers on their scouting mission and my parents out for the evening, the house is ours. 
 Only your girl banking the fires to spy on us. 
 My father receives a case each year from a friend in France. 
 Mmm. 
 Hard to get nice things with these blue jackets blockading our ports. 
 Let me make up for our obstruction. 
 ♪♪ 
 I should like to know more about you, Captain... 
 Your family, what you did growing up, your dreams. 
 Later. 
 When people are around. 
 Let's not waste an opportunity. 
 I must see that Elizabeth has retired. 
 Let the brandy tide you over till I return. 
 Ready to go home, boy? 
 [Grunts] 
 [Horse grunts] 
 Larkin : Locking lips with the Provost Marshal, are you? 
 Banfield : Think we're dumb? 
 We ain't dumb. 
 Yes. 
 I admit it. 
 I do think you're dumb, Banfield. 
 Too dumb to know there's no better reb than one trusted by the Union. 
 [Spits] 
 I am that man. 
 Worth more to our cause than 100 of you. 
 You got a plan? 
 In good time, Larkin. 
 [Horse neighs] 
 He smells my blood. 
 Hold him so I can mount. 
 I said hold him. 
 [Horse grunting] 
 [Floorboard creaks] 
 So, what do you seek, Miss Green? 
 Orders? My correspondence? 
 Is there something specific? 
 I-I confess to such curiosity about you, your family. 
 I'm getting familiar with a man I hardly know at all. 
 Can't blame a girl for being curious. 
 That's really the best you can do? 
 I take true offense to that tone. 
 Take offense? 
 You're a spy and a whore, which I find offensive. 
 [Gasps] 
 So, do I kill you myself or turn you over to be hanged? 
 [Grunts] 
 No! No! 
 No, let me go! Let me go! 
 My family will be home soon! 
 Aah! 
 Alice! 
 He tried to take me, Father. 
 You son of a bitch. 
 This lying harlot of your... 
 No! No! 
 Alice? 
 No! 
 Aah! 
 Get off! 
 Aah! 
 [Grunts] 
 No, no! James, no! 
 [Crying] 
 [Door opens] 
 Has her fever dropped? 
 A bit. 
 But it will spike again. 
 I'll watch over her tonight. 
 I'll be in my room. 
 Should anything change, find me.

 Major McBurney insists. 
 [Horse neighs] 
 We... We should call a doctor. 
 That would only bring more trouble. 
 Is he dead? 
 Oh, my God, Jimmy. So horrible. 
 Look at my dress. 
 It's so... It was so horrible, Mama. 
 Sweetheart. 
 Trying to defend your sister's honor, I... 
 I killed this man. 
 Father, you and I will roll him up in this rug. 
 What? 
 No, no. 
 This man attacked Alice. 
 Your father has justification. 
 Where do we argue that? 
 In their courtroom? 
 Before their judges? 
 Mother, Alice, you will write to his family in mimicry of his hand, saying he contemplates desertion. 
 An unfinished letter will be left for the federal authorities. 
 [Van der Berg groans] 
 Praise God, he's not dead. 
 There may be time yet. 
 It changes nothing. 
 No. No, Jimmy, we must... 
 He assaulted my sister! 
 Had he gone to battle to kill one of our boys, is it so different? 
 [Crying] 
 Jimmy's right. 
 The war isn't just out there. 
 It's in here, too. It's all around us. 
 James.
