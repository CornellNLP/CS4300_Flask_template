 Although inspired in part by a true incident, the following story is fictional and does not depict any actual person or event. 
 In the criminal justice system, sexually-based offenses are considered especially heinous. In New York City, the dedicated detectives who investigate these vicious felonies are members of an elite squad known as The Special Victims Unit. These are their stories. 
 Housekeeping. 
 Housekeeping...? 
 Oh... please excuse me, miss. 
 These hotel scenes suck. 
 Mark over there's lifting his 15th print, and we're just getting started. 
 Looks like the room's been tossed. 
 Nothing in the safe. Nothing of value anywhere else. 
 No money. 
 No jewelry. I always carry a pair of earrings in my purse. 
 Like you carry a purse. 
 That's 'cause you carry it for me. 
 Marks on the neck, huh? 
 Asphyxiation? 
 Yeah, her larynx is crushed. 
 Time of death? 
 Body's in full rigor. Approximately 12 to 18 hours ago. 
 Puts it between 4:00 and 10:00 p.m. 
 Mm-hmm. 
 Arms are crossed. 
 Minor personalization. 
 A burglar/rapist with a conscience. 
 Law & Order: SVU 
1x17 Misleader 
 Original air date : 2000/03/31 
 What are you talking about? 
 It's a power trip, Munch. 
 Aggression, control, male domination... remember? 
 A rape is a rape is a rape, of course. 
 I'm just saying you can't rule out the sexual aspect. 
 "Frick and Frack." 
 "Alphonse and Caston." 
 "Slappy and Happy." 
 You know how it is. 
 Spend time with someone, eventually they corrupt you. 
 Sure, It's a major historical force that drags great people to the lowest common denominator. 
 With you around, we're all doomed. 
 And one more case won't make a difference, so... 
 Death, probably by strangulation, early last night. 
 It reads like a robbery/ rape/homicide. 
 But there's no signs of forced entry. 
 If she fought back, she didn't do it for long. 
 Froze in fright? 
 A stranger? 
 Am I the only one on the planet that uses the peephole? 
 Good thing it only works one way. 
 The staging bothers me... arms crossed, post-mortem personalization... that's not a stranger. 
 Remorseful stranger? 
 Seems more like regret than anger. 
 You can't rule out anger. 
 Someone who knew her, someone who didn't... an angry guy... a guy with a guilty conscience. 
 How do we narrow this down? 
 That room had so many fingerprints and DNA samples it was frightening. 
 Oh, well, that's great. 
 We're doing exclusionary prints and DNA tests on the staff. 
 Tell me about the victim, people. 
 Okay... Sylvia Hadley. 
 Married, husband's in Baltimore. 
 She and her father-in-law, Dr. Benjamin Hadley, and the wife were attending the National Conference of Christian Colleges. 
 Not the Benjamin Hadley? 
 Mm-hmm. 
 More powerful than Pat Robertson, able to leap a tall Democrat in a single bound, President of Midvale College, which used to be a Podunk nothing, now it's suddenly a think tank for the neo-conservative movement? 
 Although that's an oxymoron. 
 I love you, Olivia. 
 "Family values," other euphemisms for smug sanctimony, studies of dead white men, freedom from government... 
 Husband's been notified. 
 He's catching the next flight up. 
 I'll have some plainclothes pick him up. 
 Did you talk to the in-laws? 
 They were flipped. 
 We'll need to go back for more questions. 
 Be direct, but be discreet. 
 I can smell the politics a mile away. 
 What happened to you renting me a drawer? 
 I'm gonna need it this summer. 
 It's nice and cool down here. 
 You again? 
 You get a chance to take a look at Sylvia Hadley? 
 Confirmed cause of death. 
 Manual strangulation. 
 No cloth-like abrasions, no leather cuts. 
 What about time of death? 
 I can narrow it down to between 6:30 and 9:00 last night. 
 DNA? 
 Rape kit came up positive for semen. 
 Sheets were positive for bodily fluids as well. 
 It's a good sample. 
 Until next time? 
 Thanks. 
 Versailles Hotel 142 East 63rd Street Monday, February 7 
 Do you know anything about where Sylvia went yesterday? 
 Whom she might have met with? 
 We had an awards dinner for the Christian Educators' Coalition. 
 She was supposed to go, but she said she would skip the mixer. 
 I assumed she was tired from walking. 
 You know, this is a hard city. 
 Do you want some coffee? 
 No, thank you. 
 Specifically, did she have any meetings? 
 Sylvia was independent. 
 She loved art. 
 Was anxious to go to the Met. 
 Did you see her at the hotel when she returned? 
 Briefly. She seemed tired. 
 She and Brad...they've been burning the midnight oil on the annual report. 
 Brad? 
 Weber. 
 Our financial guy. 
 He's staying here. 
 We're going to need to talk to him. 
 His firm has a New York office. 
 Mondregan Weber lnvestments. 
 Anyone have any personal grievance against her? 
 She was a fine young woman. 
 Everyone loved her. 
 She and my son had so much to look forward to. 
 We're just looking for any possible motive. 
 A drug addict or a rapist broke into her room. 
 How about lack of personal responsibility as a motive? 
 Or atheistic hedonism? 
 Ben. 
 I knew something like this would happen here. 
 You read about it all the time. 
 I trust this case is a priority, Detective? 
 Yes, sir, it is. 
 What do the guest cameras cover? 
 The entrance, the front desk, the elevator bays. 
 Employee cams cover cash-sensitive areas. 
 Do employee cams catch anything guest cams would miss? 
 No, coverage doesn't overlap. 
 The angles are different. 
 You don't have cams in the hallways? 
 Management thinks there's a fine line between protecting guests and invading their privacy. 
 Not to mention the cost. 
 You'd need cameras everywhere. 
 How do you pick up the slack? 
 Staff and guards weed out crazies and loiterers, Electronic locks are logged to show every time a door opens, staff card or guest card. 
 But staff and guards can be avoided, can't they? 
 Yeah, that's what the electronic locks are for. 
 Can you show us Sylvia Hadley's log from last night? 
 Yeah, I printed out all the activity on Mrs. Hadley's room, including room service. 
 We'll also need videotape you have since the victim arrived. 
 You can have it, but it's not timestamped. 
 Some glitch where it shows on the screens, but didn't record on tape. 
 We'll take it anyway. 
 What about the staff? 
 You guys are screening them, but you won't get a hit. 
 We do more background checks than the FBI. 
 You know anything about other burglars or other hotels? 
 Yeah, I've got a friend over at the Baxter Arms. 
 They got hit, but the guest was gone, no forced entry, no log of entry. 
 According to this, the maid cleans the room at 9:25 a.m. 
 What about room service? 
 There's lots. 
 Thursday to Friday. 
 But none during the crucial period on Sunday. 
 She got into the room at quarter of 5:00. 
 Maybe the guy was in there waiting for her. 
 And he could have left at any time. 
 Late, when no one could see him. 
 Here you go. 
 Office Of Brad Weber Mondregan Weber lnvestments 29 East 47th Street Monday, February 7 
 I live in Baltimore, but I'm in New York often enough to need an office. 
 Vice versa for my partner, Jack Mondregan. 
 You met Sylvia Hadley Sunday, correct? 
 Yes, we had a meeting. 
 Thank you. 
 There was supposed to be a report to the trustees today. 
 What did you do after the meeting? 
 I came to the office, worked late, strolled along Fifth Avenue windowshopping, and went back to the hotel. 
 And what time was that? 
 About 9:00. 
 You seem suspicious. 
 This early in the investigation, we're suspicious of everyone. 
 Anyone see you leave the office? 
 No one was here. 
 I don't know about the front door. 
 They're usually asleep. 
 This isn't a great building. 
 When you got back to the hotel, what did you do? 
 Went to my room and crashed. 
 I was pretty tired. 
 Today was supposed to be a big day. 
 Mr. Hadley, do you have any kids? 
 No. I don't know how I would have explained this to them. 
 I know this is a difficult question, but were you and your wife having any problems? 
 My wife was not having an affair. 
 That's not necessarily what I meant. 
 Were you in financial trouble? 
 Trouble with colleagues, co-workers? 
 No. 
 Do you have to put our private lives under a microscope? 
 This isn't about my wife. 
 This was one of your New York psychos out roaming the streets. 
 Only it's not "P.C." to do anything about them. 
 We understand your frustration. 
 We are doing what we can. 
 These are Detectives Benson and Stabler. 
 They're handling your case. 
 Hello, Mr. Hadley. 
 We're so sorry for your loss. 
 How's it going so far? 
 We have a few leads that we're chasing down. 
 Well, I better get down to the hotel and see my parents. 
 I'm sorry if I get frustrated. 
 I appreciate the work you're doing. 
 Excuse me. 
 We just interviewed a Brad Weber. 
 He's the guy who manages the endowment. 
 Totally struck out, though. 
 Doorman saw him leave his offices after 6:00. 
 He picked up phone messages at the front desk after 9:00. 
 Phone records checked out. 
 Exclusionary prints and DNA screens are being processed now. 
 So far, the only staff prints we have in the room are a maid's and a room service guy who has an alibi. 
 Security guy told us about a burglar who's hitting the big hotels. 
 They got a Robbery task force on him. 
 What? Burglaries aren't s*x crimes? 
 Hey, Briscoe! 
 Go through this box of security videotapes and check it out like a good man. 
 There's no timestamps, so have fun. 
 Okay, the latest victim's name is Lana Hoffman. 
 She's staying at The Sussex on the East Side. 
 When I got back to my room, it took a while before I realized my safe was cleaned out and all my jewelry was gone. 
 But what really bothered me, the other detectives dismissed as an idiosyncrasy. 
 And what was that? 
 The burglar masturbated in my underwear. 
 Now they're sitting in some evidence lock-up. 
 Not that I want them back, though. 
 They said he probably picked the room randomly. 
 You notice anything strange prior to the break-in? 
 Like what? 
 The burglar might have followed you to find out what room you were in. 
 No, nobody followed me. 
 Maybe he waited down in the lobby? 
 There was this one guy. 
 It seems like he was always in the lounge reading a newspaper. 
 We rode the elevator up once. 
 He creeped me out bad. 
 Yeah? What'd he look like? 
 Smallish build, wire-rim glasses. 
 But he always wore the same red baseball cap. 
 That's why I noticed. 
 I thought, "Some men never grow up." 
 I didn't think of it till now. 
 31st Precinct Burglary Taskforce Tuesday, February 8 
 Why didn't you call us? 
 And hand the case over? 
 No, we're capable of just lending a hand. Same shield, same team. 
 It's just a standard set of burglaries. 
 No, each consecutive burglary had an increased degree of sexual fetishism. 
 This guy was escalating. 
 Oh, yeah... they're all just "rapists-in-training." 
 Why don't you take all the burglaries in Manhattan? 
 We only want the one where the burglar spills his seed in the victim's "u-trou." 
 The thing bothering us is how clear it was this guy was going to hurt someone... he was under no threat from you. 
 Like to see how you'd have helped. 
 We could have told you He's not in it for money, meaning you're wasting your time looking for stolen goods on the street. 
 He stalks his victims for a couple of days, he gets close to them... these are not random robberies. 
 How about he likes blondes? 
 He gets half his rush from being in plain view in the hotel. 
 Now a woman's dead because you were protecting your collar. 
 So we didn't call you. 
 No one wants to call you, ever. 
 You guys are up to your necks in perversity 24/7. 
 My men don't understand why you picked your squad. 
 People like you make our squad necessary. 
 Yeah? Well, my people don't want whatever it is you got. 
 You're tainted. 
 Benson. 
 10 bucks says the only other cops you hang out with are Brooklyn SVU. 
 You lose. 
 Bronx SVU. 
 We'll take these. 
 We'll make copies. 
 That was Cragen. 
 What'd he want? 
 Victim was pregnant. 
 What do you know? 
 Double homicide. 
 How's Briscoe doing on those tapes? 
 He's working on the hotel schedule to sort out the videos. 
 It's going to take time. 
 He's keeping his eye out for the baseball cap. 
 These are the hotels our guy has hit since he started four months ago. 
 He hit the Baxter Arms over a week ago. 
 He's done each hotel either once or twice. 
 No forced entry, occupant not in room. He didn't use staff cards. 
 He's only hitting hotels with key card access to the rooms. 
 I wonder if he's got something that cracks the codes to the locks. 
 I thought only the Feds had that technology. 
 Could be ex-FBI or CIA. 
 Hoover led from the top down. 
 His "lingerie legacy" could still be alive. 
 People, I think you should all listen to this. 
 ...her rape and murder related to a tragedy which is much larger. 
 It's a part of the moral decay of America. 
 At Midvale, we still believe in the absolute truth... that morality and family strength is still important. 
 This... city has taken a valued member of our organization... of our family... away from us. 
 We will not rest until the killer is found. 
 Dr. Hadley, are you going to continue with your schedule of fundraising events... 
 Now, can anyone tell me where we are on this thing? 
 We got a burglar with a similar M.O. And description. 
 Get him, 'cause we all know who's on the other end of that phone call. 
 Ralliston Hotel 43 West 44th Street Wednesday, February 9 
 Six-two-four. 
 He's on the sixth floor. 
 He went into room 624. 
 Got it. 
 Wrong room. 
 Hands on top of your head... now. 
 Pat him down. 
 That's our collar. 
 Like hell it is. 
 It's a special task force appointed by the commissioner. 
 Our ongoing investigation takes precedence. 
 Our captain's been talking to the mayor. 
 He didn't like hearing about your unwillingness to cooperate. 
 Wait a minute... Don't... 
 Don't touch me. 
 I don't like to be touched. 
 If that's the guy that's questioning me, I definitely want my lawyer present. 
 Your kit would make certain covert enforcement agencies jealous. 
 Actually, their stuff is a little more refined. 
 Where did you get it? 
 I made it. 
 John, don't say any more. 
 It's not hard. 
 I'm a computer programmer. 
 I worked for an electronic lock company. 
 What happened? 
 They fired me. 
 John... 
 Why? 
 Because I was the only one bothered by the illusion we were perpetuating. 
 I know... any hotel staff member can get into your room... 
 All the keys, the key cards, are sitting there on the maid carts. 
 There's one combination that opens every room safe in the entire hotel. 
 If you want me to help you, you better stop talking. 
 Your job is to get me the best deal I can. 
 They've got me. 
 All the stuff I took, it's just sitting in my apartment nicely catalogued so it can be easily returned. 
 It's not about the stealing, I was trying to prove a point. 
 Could you just shut up for a second? 
 Perhaps you two would like some time alone. 
 Guy thinks he's a White House Plumber and you're G. Gordon Liddy. 
 Ouch. In round two, we go "Bad cop on his ass." 
 Right, Jeffries? 
 Cool. 
 The Hadleys in the squad room. 
 We're debating the pregnancy. 
 You think we should tell 'em? 
 No. 
 It's a card we should hold onto. 
 That's what we were thinkin'. 
 You always had this underwear fetish? 
 No, but I came to realize that's just who I am. 
 But "no harm, no foul," right? 
 That's just it... we're talking "big harm, big foul." 
 What are you talking about? 
 Where were you Sunday night? 
 Why? 
 We've got a dead, raped woman, and you look pretty good for it. 
 What? 
 No! 
 I wouldn't hurt anybody. 
 I'm not wired that way. 
 "Boxing the clown" in woman's underwear? 
 That's pretty freaky. 
 And to us, "buddy boy," it's a short stretch of road between that and rape/homicide. 
 I'm gonna need a moment with my client. 
 No, it's okay. 
 I want to clear this up right now. 
 I did not rape anybody. 
 Where were you? 
 I was down at the Soho East. 
 I stole a diamond-studded collar off a terrier. 
 It's the only dog-friendly hotel in the city. 
 The owner must have left him in the room during dinner. 
 Cute dog. 
 I want to see him. 
 That's probably not the best idea. 
 I'm sorry, but after all that, we don't think he's our guy. 
 I don't believe this. 
 These things take time, sir. 
 And to get the press all riled up does not help things. 
 I know, and I apologize. 
 We're under a lot of pressure. 
 We realize how hard your job is. 
 How hard can it be? 
 My wife was killed in a hotel. 
 We're going to find your wife's killer, but as my partner said, these things take time. 
 We'll be going. I'm sure you have a lot of work to do. 
 Well, that was nice. 
 I hope you got some ideas. 
 A guest at the Soho East reported a break-in on Sunday. 
 Amongst the stolen goods was a diamond-studded dog collar. 
 I'm working on the search warrant for John Fenwick's apartment. 
 Maybe Sylvia was having an affair. 
 Why else wouldn't she tell her husband that she was pregnant? 
 Maybe she wanted to make sure before she told him? 
 What are the odds that another stranger was in the hotel stalking her? 
 We all know about odds. 
 It would fit with the lack of self-defense. 
 We've seen victims who don't fight back because they feel guilty. 
 They feel they're being punished for something that's their fault. 
 Maybe she knew the guy. 
 She must have let the attacker in. 
 There's a chance this gal wasn't as family-oriented as Ben and Dr. Hadley. 
 Okay... Munch, Jeffries, finish with this Fenwick guy. 
 Benson, Stabler, first thing tomorrow morning, it's back to the hotel with you. 
 Take a closer look at Sylvia. 
 Oh, yeah, I remember her. 
 Probably wouldn't have had if she hadn't gotten killed. 
 But when you're in the news, it kind of solidifies everything in your mind. 
 What do you remember? 
 She was a pain in the ass. 
 Why do you say that? 
 She ordered a lot of room service. 
 But, one of my guys would bring it up, and then she'd remember something else she wanted. 
 Maybe she was ordering for two people. 
 Well, that's possible. 
 She never ordered dinner or anything... always just hors d'oeuvres. 
 
 
 
 Hey, Tony, remember that woman in room 1810? 
 The one who bit it? Yeah. 
 You remember if she was ever with somebody? 
 Whenever I came in the room, the bathroom door was closed. 
 I guess there could have been a guy in there, or a girl. 
 You're investigating her murder? 
 Yes. 
 Sorry about the comment. 
 Guests become room numbers after a while. 
 Thanks, Tony. 
 I remember one night, she called at 11:00 p.m., wanted to have the mini-bar in her room restocked. 
 I said we couldn't do it, so she said she was going down to the bar. 
 Doesn't sound like the picture the Hadleys painted. 
 People do all sorts of things in hotels. 
 You know, the anonymous nature of it all? 
 Anyway, that was the night before she was killed... 
 Saturday night. 
 Yeah, I remember her. 
 She was in here Friday, Saturday night. 
 I heard about her on Monday when I came back to work. 
 Was she alone or was she with someone? 
 Saturday she was here with a guy. 
 They looked like they worked together. 
 She was laying it on pretty thick, too. 
 How do you mean? 
 You know, laying her hand on his arm every time he cracked a joke. 
 Talking quietly so he had to lean in to hear her. 
 Was he receptive? 
 Two people come in, they're both married to other people. 
 She's drinking apple martinis to try to lose control, he's drinking Amstel Lights to try to keep it. 
 You've seen it before? 
 They weren't making out at the bar or anything, but they left together. 
 She couldn't walk without him. 
 You know if the guy was staying in this hotel? 
 Yeah. If I remember correctly, he charged the tab to his room. 
 Let me check. 
 Here we go. 
 Room 1232. 
 Brad Weber. 
 Thanks. 
 Mr. Weber, thanks for coming down here. 
 Glad to help, though I don't know how I can. 
 Well, how well did you know Sylvia Hadley? 
 You people asked me that before. 
 Yeah, we're just trying to understand her state of mind. 
 How often did you meet with her? 
 There was a monthly meeting with Dr. Hadley, but Sylvia and I have met more often lately. 
 Why? 
 It's a high maintenance account. 
 Narrow margin for error. 
 The college depends on a precise cash flow and a rigorous rate of return. 
 They're also my biggest client. 
 Saturday at the hotel bar... investment meeting, or date? 
 It was an investment meeting. 
 You're married, Mr. Weber, aren't you? 
 Yes. Happily. 
 Were you and Sylvia having an affair? 
 Absolutely not. 
 See, that's the part that doesn't make sense. 
 We've got a bartender who puts you two in a very friendly situation at the bar. 
 I couldn't help that. 
 She hit on me. 
 It felt like harassment. 
 She could ruin my life. 
 I had to be nice. 
 That we don't buy. 
 And you just gave us a motive. 
 What do you mean? 
 You two were having an affair, she wanted to break it off, you'd lose her as a client. 
 That's not true. 
 You killed her to protect yourself. 
 No! 
 There was no affair. 
 That night she was half drunk for our meeting. 
 She wanted to go to the bar afterwards. I had to. 
 What do you mean you "had to"? 
 What about a polite refusal? 
 She insisted. 
 She hit on me, and it was nice to have an attractive woman on your arm in New York... people looking, jealous. 
 I ordered beers and drank them slowly. 
 I don't know why... it still went to my head. 
 I don't drink that often. 
 We left, and I found myself walking back to her room. 
 We kissed outside her room, but that was it. 
 Mr. Weber, you expect us to believe it stopped there? 
 You're married, aren't you? 
 This is not about me, it's about you. 
 You'll understand this if you are. 
 The thought hit me that I had just transformed my relationship with my wife forever. 
 It cleared my head. 
 I went back to my room. 
 Sounds pretty convenient. 
 Sounds pretty damned inconvenient if you ask me. 
 Where were you Sunday night? 
 I was in my room. 
 I told you. 
 Maybe you went straight to Sylvia's room from work. 
 You left her room at 9:00 to build up your alibi. 
 No. 
 Did you watch any pay movies? 
 Oh my God, no. 
 That is not good for your story. 
 I've known Brad for a long time. 
 He's very good with the endowment's money. 
 You're sort of damning him with faint praise, aren't you? 
 "For with what judgment ye judge, ye shall be judged, and with what measure ye meet, it will be measured to you again." 
 Could we leave the Scripture out of this just for a moment? 
 What we want to know, flat out, is there pertinent information to this investigation we should know about Brad Weber? 
 He's always a little... 
 "in the tank" at our functions. 
 And he's known to make passes at the women. 
 In the past, we've usually just laughed it off. 
 Nobody's laughing now. 
 Dr. Hadley, are you sure that there wasn't a personal connection between Brad and Sylvia? 
 They worked together. 
 I can't imagine him hurting her. 
 We only needed a financial update once a month. 
 Sylvia chose to work more closely with Brad on the management of the endowment. 
 What's that supposed to mean? 
 Come on, Ben. 
 Late nights... two or three times a week? 
 It's possible you just didn't want to see it. 
 Did they ever argue? 
 Not that I ever heard. 
 Not during the daytime, anyway. 
 This is unbelievable. 
 What if Sylvia was in a relationship she wanted to end, and Mr. Weber didn't want to lose the account? 
 God help him. 
 I prayed that it would be a stranger. 
 You lied to us. We hear you were "in the bag" at every Midvale function. 
 We also heard when you tie one on, you become quite the ladies' man. 
 What? 
 You told us you didn't drink often. 
 I don't. Do you have any idea how nervewracking those things are? 
 Cool it, Brad. 
 We got people telling us you and Sylvia met more often than was necessary. 
 Who said that? 
 Everyone. 
 No one has any idea what goes into keeping that college afloat. 
 We were having the extra meetings because there's a huge balloon payment due next quarter. 
 It's complicated, and requires a lot of coordination. 
 The trustees are panicked. 
 What kind of payment we talking about here? 
 Hadley structured a poor deal back in the '70s when he and a few investors bought the college. 
 High risk, high interest, no intermediate payments. 
 It's biting him on the ass now. 
 Sylvia and I had to fix the problem. 
 That's why Hadley's out there still stumping. 
 We still have your admission to fooling around with Sylvia, and the only person who can confirm that story is dead. 
 I told you that because I didn't kill Sylvia, and what I did do wasn't wrong... very. 
 Look, Brad's never been in trouble before, let alone falsely accused. 
 Frankly, he told the truth because I wasn't around. 
 He's going to remain our prime suspect unless he gives us something to divert our attention. 
 Like a blood test, for starters. 
 I didn't do anything. 
 He'll take the blood test. 
 Look at this. Midvale College was censured by the American Association of University Professors. 
 "Inadequate protection against an improper exercise of administrative power." 
 Dr. Hadley had a penchant for axing those that disagreed with him. 
 Ah, Dr. Hadley's doctorate. 
 It's from Lutheran Ministry College, Jackson, Mississippi. 
 He's a preacher, all right. 
 Of the Hadleys, who do you think you can get more information from? 
 The son. 
 Okay... the Hadleys are holding a memorial service for Sylvia at St. Albans. 
 That is in one hour. 
 Munch, Jeffries, see if you can track down one of these professors he axed. 
 New York University Washington Square Park Thursday, February 10 
 Can you tell us about your employment experience at Midvale College? 
 We understand Dr. Hadley learned some some of his management technique from Stalin. 
 One could say that statement is accurate. 
 Tell us about it. 
 I am a professor of philosophy. 
 I started teaching there in '89 because at Brown, the best literature was being run out of the curriculum. 
 "There's nothing of merit to learn from dead Europeans." 
 Right. 
 Midvale was a good place to learn and teach a classic curriculum. 
 We pushed our students to question every perceived truth. 
 What happened? 
 "On The Origin of Species" was the first to go. 
 The college became something I hated. 
 I fought with Hadley, but I realized, to him, the curriculum was nothing more than a way to tap into wealthy conservative donors. 
 Did you know Sylvia Hadley? 
 Not well. 
 Rumor was that she was spending more time working with Hadley Sr. Than living with Hadley Jr. 
 Which is not surprising, in and of itself. 
 Why not? 
 Junior is a nice fellow, but nepotism got him the job. 
 Sylvia, on the other hand, she was headstrong, I'll give you that. 
 Together, we have made Midvale a reality. 
 Sylvia... was a large source of our strength. 
 And that is why I am announcing the establishment of the Sylvia Stone Hadley Memorial Fund. 
 Thank you for coming here today to honor Sylvia... and... for the kindness you have shown my family during this dark time. 
 God bless you. 
 Thanks for coming. 
 How's it going? 
 As well as can be expected, I guess. 
 Anything on Weber yet? 
 He's volunteered DNA to test with the sample that we got from the crime scene. 
 This whole thing, it's unbelievable. 
 People do things they never imagined they were capable of. 
 I guess you see it all the time. 
 It's just, Brad and Sylvia... 
 Is there any other person with whom she had frequent personal contact that we should be looking at? 
 No. 
 Anything you may have noticed about her state of mind? 
 Look, in the last couple of years she changed a lot. 
 Our marriage was fine, but she wasn't the same person I married. 
 Well, people change. 
 That's marriage. 
 No, she became this person I didn't even know anymore. 
 Flying all over the country, cell phone permanently attached to her ear. 
 I knew less and less about her life. 
 Say, is the staff angle completely dead? 
 DNA screening turned up no one. 
 Brad Weber's DNA came back negative. 
 He's also resigned his post as manager of the endowment. 
 You know, this whole college is a family operation. 
 I know the dysfunctional family's a cliche... 
 Scorecard, people. 
 The old man was being honored by his born-again peers. 
 Junior was grading papers in Baltimore. 
 What about the mother, Sharon Hadley? 
 She does appear to be the glue that holds the family together. 
 Well, genetics make the family. 
 We got DNA on everybody else. 
 Let's get some from the Hadleys, too. 
 We're going to need a court order on the father. My guess. 
 All right. Ask him nicely. 
 If he refuses, a court order it is. 
 Then get the mother up here alone. 
 I want to get the full story. 
 It's time we found out just how strong this glue is. 
 You sure I can't get you anything to drink? 
 No. 
 You can have a seat. 
 Mrs. Hadley, when you look back, was Sylvia happy? 
 Yes. 
 She loved the college. 
 You should have seen her work a fundraiser. 
 It was magnificent. 
 And what about your son? 
 He loved to teach. 
 And was your son happy with Sylvia? 
 Yes. 
 They were a good team. 
 He wished she would work less. 
 He wanted to spend more time with her. 
 That's not the same thing as being happy. 
 Happiness is highly overrated, Detective. 
 A marriage is a working partnership, consecrated by our Lord. 
 Okay. 
 And was it? 
 Consecrated? 
 Yes. 
 So Sylvia was faithful? 
 She was. 
 She was... faithful to all of us. 
 I'm sorry... can you clarify that? 
 She loved her job. 
 She loved the school, her family... 
 Mrs. Hadley, did you know that Sylvia was two months pregnant? 
 You didn't know? 
 Why didn't your son tell you that? 
 Whatever it is that you're holding on to... is gone. 
 We can help you. 
 He wouldn't have known. 
 Oh, God, I prayed for forgiveness. 
 I forgave him. 
 How could this have happened? 
 How could he have done this? 
 How could your son have done what? 
 Not my son... my husband. 
 He had an affair for two years with Sylvia. 
 This Hadley is a religious huckster in the "Aimee Semple McPherson" mode. 
 A "Swaggart," a "Bakker"... with Swaggart's proclivity toward "extra-marital ministrations." 
 And he knows that once he's exposed, the money stops. 
 This upcoming balloon payment is gasoline on the fire. 
 Okay, okay. We got to get moving quickly on this. 
 I will convince Mrs. Hadley to stay here. 
 If she insists on leaving, we arrest her. 
 For...? 
 Obstruction... it doesn't matter. 
 We have to make sure she doesn't give him a heads-up. 
 We'll bring in Senior. 
 Shall we bring in the little guy, too? 
 Why not? Let's see if blood does run thicker. 
 Keep 'em separated. 
 I don't want 'em saying so much as a word to each other. 
 For the last time, my friends, I'm not going to get into any particulars until my lawyer arrives. 
 Well, that's fine by me. 
 Anyhow, your DNA's going to corroborate your wife's story. 
 What story? 
 Maybe we shouldn't say anything until your lawyer gets here. 
 What's up? 
 Kid's got something interesting. 
 What do you got? 
 Those videotapes are wild. 
 You wouldn't believe what goes on in elevators when people think they're alone. 
 It's better than any video I ever rented. 
 I hope this isn't what you had to tell us. 
 No. 
 The video wasn't timecoded. 
 I had to use other visual cues to establish the timeline. 
 In the evening on Friday there was a Girl Scout meeting. 
 Sunday morning, cardiologist convention checks out. 
 That afternoon, these wedding guests arrived. 
 You can tell 'cause they got neat welcome baskets from the front desk just loaded down with "Maker's Mark." 
 So the wedding party gets bourbon...? 
 Take a look at this. 
 My best guess is, this guy was on the elevator on Sunday between 4:00 p.m. 
 And 6:00 p.m., and next to him is a guy with... your bottle of "Maker's Mark." 
 You're sure about this? 
 Absolutely. 
 Ben Jr. Wasn't in Baltimore. 
 He used a credit card to purchase an 11:00 a.m. 
 Baltimore-New York express train ticket. 
 An ATM withdrawal at the Times Square Chase Manhattan late Sunday night, 10:53 p.m. 
 Here he is entering the lobby in the hotel. 
 Here he is in the elevator. 
 Just proves fantastic liars don't necessarily make good killers. 
 The son who was supposedly in Baltimore at the time of the murder was actually here in New York in the hotel. 
 What's your theory? 
 These holy rollers are in fact, surprise-surprise... grifters. 
 The old man and his so-called investors took over some third-rate college when it went Chapter 11. 
 Then resurrected it as "Born-Again U." 
 Maybe the victim knew the books were cooked. 
 She was shaking down Hadley Sr. For a slice of the action. 
 Or "B," she was a true believer. 
 Maybe she was disgusted by what was going on and threatening to blow the whistle. 
 Where's the s*x crime in this? 
 She had s*x before dying. 
 Not necessarily rape. 
 Check out these DNA results. 
 Talk about "Old Testament." 
 All right, I want both of them. 
 We're gonna have to get 'em to turn on each other. 
 Take two polecats, throw 'em in the same bag, and look out. 
 We have you in a big, big lie, Ben. 
 He was in shock. 
 His wife's death disoriented him. 
 It's only natural. 
 I must agree with Dr. Hadley. 
 This has been an extraordinarily traumatic experience for his son. 
 You can't expect... 
 First your father, and then his lawyer. 
 You ever speak for yourself? 
 I don't know. 
 I'm not sure what to say. 
 Come on, Junior. 
 It's a tale of two cities. 
 New York, or was it Baltimore? 
 I was home in Baltimore. 
 My father called and said there had been a terrible tragedy in the hotel. 
 Detective Jeffries? 
 These are the lab results. 
 Your wife's throttled neck and a piece of skin from under your fingernail... perfect match. 
 I didn't... 
 Don't. Not a word. 
 And these are the DNA results from semen found in Sylvia. 
 Also a match. 
 What are you talking about? 
 Ben, shut up. 
 This is a complete and total invasion of my family's privacy. 
 Sure, blame the messenger. 
 Detective, does the sperm DNA match that of Ben Jr.? 
 No, sir. 
 What the hell's going on here? 
 Ask your father. 
 It's his sperm. 
 My father's? 
 My father...? 
 You?! 
 You and Sylvia? 
 Can we continue this in private, Captain? 
 Would you like to make a statement now? 
 I'd been suspicious for some time. 
 When this trip came up, I couldn't stand it any longer. 
 I got a train ticket and I came up here. 
 To the hotel? 
 When I got to the room, I knocked and knocked and knocked. 
 I felt like such an idiot. 
 It took her five minutes to open the door. 
 And then what happened? 
 She... said she'd been sleeping. 
 But with whom? 
 That's what I wanted to know. 
 And how did she respond? 
 She laughed. 
 Said I was paranoid. 
 That the thought of her cheating was the only original thought I'd ever had. 
 What did she mean by that? 
 It was her favorite put-down. 
 You know, like... the only job I could get was at my daddy's college. 
 And then I... 
 I lost it. 
 You "lost it" how? 
 I grabbed her shoulder. 
 I wanted to shake some sense into her. 
 And she went limp... like she wanted to be punished. 
 Then I was looking at my hands around her neck, and wondering what I was doing choking her. 
 We can finish this later. 
 You always had to make everything right! 
 And to think I came to you to fix this. 
 Mrs. Hadley. 
 Sharon... did you hear? Poor Ben. 
 She knows a lot more than you think, Dr. Hadley. 
 No, no... she had nothing to do with this. 
 Protecting me, Ben? 
 Protecting me from the truth? 
 How thoughtful of you. 
 How "Christian." 
 That's why you made up that robbery story? 
 To cover up what he'd done? 
 That's not true. 
 That's ludicrous. 
 Oh. 
 Then maybe it was to make sure Ben didn't know she was pregnant. 
 What? 
 What are you talking about? 
 It's not something the medical examiner would easily miss, Doctor. 
 All of the DNA reports are here. 
 It's... well, have a look. 
 What were you going to call him, Ben? 
 "Son"? 
 "Ben lll"? 
 That's the grief talking. 
 No, this is me talking! 
 A lifetime of grief, yes. 
 And two years of watching my husband... my soon-to-be-former husband... fornicating with my son's wife. 
 Sharon...? 
 Fathering his own grandchild.
