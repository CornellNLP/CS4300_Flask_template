 In the criminal justice system, sexually-based offenses are considered especially heinous. In New York City, the dedicated detectives who investigate these vicious felonies are members of an elite squad known as The Special Victims Unit. These are their stories. 
 Mom? 
 Mom, it's me. 
 I'm sorry. I know it's late. 
 I'm sorry you've been worried. 
 I need a ride! 
 I'm pretty far away. 
 Mom, I wa... I was attacked! 
 I was raped. 
 Yes, that's what I said. 
 21st and 7th. 
 No, I'm not okay. 
 This man, he drove me to a vacant lot. 
 He pulled out a gun. 
 He told me to get out, and then he did it. 
 He raped you? 
 Yes. He said if I told anyone, he'd kill me. 
 Why did you get into his car? 
 I just got in. 
 You just got in? 
 Yes. 
 Why? 
 I sort of knew him. 
 I thought he was a stranger? 
 He was. We met in a chat room. 
 Oh, like on the internet? 
 Yeah. He seemed decent enough by email and everything. 
 So you did know him? 
 This was the first time seeing him in person. 
 We're going to ask you to work with a sketch artist later. 
 I can do that. 
 So how'd you know it was him? 
 He said he'd be in a beige Mercury Sable and that he'd pick me up at the coffeehouse at 7:00. 
 What was his name? 
 I only know his screen name. 
 The Yachtsman. 
 The Yachtsman? 
 I thought with a name like that he'd be a gentleman. 
 It shows you how wrong you can be. 
 Law & Order: SVU 
1x18 Chat Room 
 Original air date : 2000/04/14 
 16 year old girl named Karen Ray gave us these drawings of a man who raped and abducted her. 
 Abducted? What happened? 
 It's not a stranger abduction. 
 Not like that. 
 This is not the name his mother gave him. 
 "The Yachtsman"... maybe we should work with the Coast Cuard. 
 It's a chat room name. 
 They met online. 
 Right now, that's all we got. 
 I love the information super high way. 
 You can meet creepazoids from all over the world without leaving home. 
 How's the victim taking it? 
 She was pretty shaken up last night, but we're going to reinterview this morning. 
 By the time the lab comes back with anything, this guy could be halfway around the world. 
 So we got to move on this, people, and now. 
 I'd like to get into her computer. 
 It's the most direct route to this guy. 
 Yeah, it is. Raye lives in Brooklyn with her mother. 
 You and Munch pick up the computer, put a name to this Yachtsman. 
 70 million people on the internet... every one a suspect. 
 You got into his car at about 7:00? 
 Yeah, around 7:00. 
 You checked into the hospital after 11:00, right? 
 That sounds about right. 
 What happened before the attack? 
 Did you talk to him? 
 Sure. 
 What'd you talk about? 
 My school, my family. 
 I was pretty eager to meet this guy. 
 Stupid, isn't it? 
 You've been corresponding for a while, right? 
 Email, you mean? 
 About three to four months. 
 Why'd you choose last night to meet this guy? 
 We'd been talking about it for a while, and... online, I mean. 
 Last night just seemed like the right time. 
 Who picked the date, you or him? 
 I did. 
 And why last night? 
 I thought I could get out. 
 Tuesday night is Mom's big night out... choir practice. 
 So you just got in his car and you drove around for three or four hours. 
 Seems like a long time. 
 Yeah, well, not all of it was driving. 
 Some of it was just parking. 
 Okay. 
 Okay. You know what I think we should do? 
 Why don't we just grab a car? 
 We'll retrace your route, and maybe it'll help you remember more. 
 Did you mean go all the places all over again? 
 Yeah. 
 Do we have to? 
 Karen, that's how we're going to find this guy. 
 Home Of Melissa Raye 586 4th Street Brooklyn Wednesday, February 23 
 What time did your daughter leave last night, Ms. Raye? 
 I dropped her off at the library at 6:15. 
 When I went to check on her at 8:30, she wasn't there. 
 You went to check on her? 
 I went to check on her. 
 I would've stayed the whole night if I didn't have choir practice. 
 So you don't trust her? 
 No, I trust her, but as Ronald Reagan said, "Trust but verify." 
 She's at that age. 
 What age is that? 
 The age when she's got a woman's body, but the sense of judgment of a child. 
 Oh. Has she had problems with boyfriends? 
 She's too young to have boyfriends. 
 I understand, but it's not unusual for a girl her age to date. 
 Yeah, well, she doesn't date. 
 She's allowed to attend church or school functions as long as there's a chaperone. 
 And she's welcome to have a boy into our home as long as he's a friend. 
 Has she done that? 
 No. 
 I thought the weirdo that did this was from the lnternet. 
 Just because she didn't know him, doesn't mean he didn't know her. 
 Do you think we could look at her computer? 
 I wouldn't have a computer in my home. 
 The computer's over at her father's apartment. 
 You're divorced? 
 We never married, because when I was Karen's age I didn't have somebody looking out for me the way I look out for her. 
 Do you allow her to visit him? 
 I don't allow it. 
 He got a court order forcing me to let her go there every other weekend. 
 And if that makes sense, you tell me. 
 Is this the corner where he picked you up? 
 Yes. 
 Okay, which corner? 
 Right over there. 
 What direction was he driving? 
 This direction. 
 All right, you just tell us where to turn, okay? 
 Make a quick left. 
 This right here is a oneway. 
 I can only take a right. 
 Well, I guess I was wrong. 
 Go right. 
 Are you sure, Karen? 
 I said go right, okay? 
 Okay. 
 Home Of David Marolo 240 Willow Street, Brooklyn Wednesday, February 23 
 Karen's a good kid. 
 She studies hard. 
 Is she an "A" student? 
 Were you? 
 As a matter of fact, I was... except for the sciences and Spanish. 
 What about her computer usage? 
 She downloaded a lot of songs. 
 Did you monitor where she surfed? 
 Ah, hell, Karen knows more about that thing than I do. What's to monitor? 
 She says she met her attacker online. 
 I know. 
 Would you mind if we took your computer with us for a few days? 
 What? 
 There are a few naked pictures on there, too. 
 They're not hers. 
 They're yours? 
 It's not p0rn or anything. 
 It's nudes... women posing with big cats. 
 Lions, leopards, that sort of thing. 
 It's password protected. 
 She could never get to it. 
 I'm sure she never saw a thing. 
 This where it happened? 
 Yes. 
 A lot of people around. 
 No one saw you or heard anything? 
 I don't know. 
 I was scared. I was terrified. 
 You don't believe me? 
 It's just like they say. 
 This is worse than the rape. 
 It happened right here and you guys act like I'm making this up. 
 Karen, we're just trying to get the details right. 
 But if there's something you're not telling us, you have to come clean. 
 He put a gun to my head, he told me to take my pants off and he raped me. 
 And you guys don't believe me! 
 How did you get my dad's computer? 
 Your father wants to catch this guy as much as we do. 
 Okay, Karen, why don't you wait for us in that room over there? 
 Debbie. We'll get you a soda or something. 
 Right in there. 
 What is that? 
 That is leopardus pardalis, commonly know as the ocelot, posing with Bree Crosley. 
 Commonly known as Miss September. 
 It's just her father's stuff. 
 We were coming to the same conclusion... there is no Yachtsman. 
 Then who's been sending her all these highminded justifications for MayDecember relationships? 
 What's in here? 
 A lot of derivative symbolist poetry. 
 Plus pictures, but they're encrypted or something... we can't see them. 
 There's a tech guy coming over. 
 He says he thinks he can show them to us. 
 We read some of the things that this guy emailed to you. 
 Oh, no. 
 He's a predator, Karen, why are you protecting him? 
 I'm not protecting him. 
 He didn't really take you to that parking lot, did he? 
 No. 
 You made that part up. 
 Yes. 
 Listen, it's okay. 
 We just need you to tell us what really happened. 
 Karen, look at me. 
 Even though he didn't use force, he still took advantage of you. 
 We can charge him with statutory rape. 
 Those cases are taken very seriously nowadays. 
 Could he go to jail? 
 Yes, he could. 
 What have I done? 
 I never met The Yachtsman. 
 What? 
 He was this guy that me and my girlfriends used to email as a joke. 
 Okay, so who were you with? 
 I was with my boyfriend Keith. 
 Your boyfriend? 
 Why'd you tell us you were raped? 
 Because we made love and I didn't want my mom to find out. 
 She's totally paranoid and she would've known. 
 How? 
 When I come home she makes me undress in front of her and she smells my hair. 
 She's a total fascist. 
 Please, please, don't tell my mother. 
 She'll kill me. 
 Karen, nothing your mother does or might do justifies you filing a false police report. 
 You understand that's a serious crime? 
 I'm sorry. 
 All this time we spent looking for someone who doesn't exist is time that we didn't spend trying to help women who were raped. 
 Now you think about them. 
 I'm sorry. What can I do? 
 First recant the story that you told us earlier. 
 Then, tell us what really happened. 
 Are you going to arrest my boyfriend? 
 Why would we do that? 
 Because he's 21. 
 We should talk to him. 
 What, Karen? 
 Yeah, your girlfriend. 
 Karen Raye, right? 
 Is she in trouble? 
 Did something happen to her? 
 We're sorting that out but she's okay. 
 Yeah, come on. 
 That's good. 
 How old are you? 
 Uh, 21. 
 How old is she? 
 16. 
 I know, the age difference. 
 But she is more mature than any girl I've ever met in college. 
 Keith, trust me, She's not that mature. 
 You know why we're talking? 
 No. 
 You ever hear of statutory rape? 
 Now you seem like a nice guy to me. 
 You like her? 
 Yeah. 
 You love her? 
 Yeah. 
 You don't seem too sure to me. 
 Look, give it a rest. 
 A year, a year an a half, you still think you want to go out with her, hey, you'll have no problems with me. 
 Yeah, I hear you. 
 Good. 
 That's it. 
 Thanks. 
 You know, the only difference between here and robbery is robbery victims don't lie. 
 It's not a waste of time. 
 Have you seen Yachtsman's letters? 
 I thought it was hot air. He didn't really try to set up a meeting with her? 
 Well, not with her. 
 But? 
 We did a little digging. 
 He emailed her some photos of himself. Take a look. 
 The man's face is blackened out, but not his date's. 
 How old is that girl? 
 Not old enough. 
 Not nearly old enough. 
 I don't need to look at this crap. 
 It's evidence, Elliot. 
 How many photos were on her computer? 
 Too many. 
 I guess he sent them several times a day. 
 Every time I open my email, I have messages waiting for me. 
 And they're always from Tina or Betsy or Mitzy having something to show me. 
 Yeah, "Hottest teen site on the lnternet." 
 And they're just there right when you log on. 
 If they are teens. 
 These sites, you can't tell their ages. 
 You don't even know if it's the girl posing. 
 It can be a cutandpaste job. 
 They're being scanned in from a Sears catalog. 
 And if we get them... 
 Dickie, Maureen, Elizabeth and Kathleen do, too. 
 I know. 
 It scares me. 
 Honey, it scares me, too, but I can't just walk into a room and restrain the guy. 
 Why not? 
 These predators, you tell me where they are. 
 I can't hear 'em. I can't see 'em. 
 But they're out there. 
 Honey, they're in here. 
 He's one of your internet users. 
 Clients. And we value their privacy. I'm sorry. 
 We have reason to believe he may have posed for s*x pictures. 
 So? 
 With a minor. 
 I'm sure your other clients would want to know you're doing everything you can to fight this problem. 
 Okay, what do you want to know about this Yachtsman? 
 Where he is. 
 Just take a minute. 
 You can find out anything you want about somebody from their email address? 
 Sure, once you're online, we can follow you anywhere. 
 So much for anonymity. 
 Well, what happens when you click on Amazon? 
 It says, "Welcome, Olivia Benson." 
 That's right, and that's before you type anything. 
 Every time you click that mouse, you're sending out personal info on little things called cookies. 
 The lnternet's like a gigantic tape recorder that just runs 24 hours a day. 
 Okay. 
 Yachtsman. 
 His real name's Harry Waters. 
 Waters? 
 He likes to visit just about every kind of s*x chat room. 
 Underage stuff? 
 Yeah, but not exclusively. 
 He also visited mainstream p0rn sites, programming sites, music sites. 
 What are the music sites? 
 Britney Spears, Backstreet Boys, 98 Degrees. 
 My daughter likes them. 
 Waters is about like any of our users. 
 For example, he also liked poker and auctions. 
 What'd he buy at eBay? 
 Looks like... panties... used panties. 
 He won seven panty auctions in the last year. 
 That's disgusting. 
 Very disgusting. 
 You got his home address? 
 It's a work address. 
 So give us that. 
 Universal dot net. 
 Had their IPO right after we did. 
 Never liked the guy. 
 So why'd you hire him? 
 He was the best. 
 He's a really good programmer. 
 But? 
 After the IPO, we sprung for this huge trip to Cuba. 
 See a game... 
 The Orioles. 
 Yeah! It was a big deal, and Waters didn't even go to the game. 
 So where did he go? 
 He said he was sick... something he ate. 
 So we felt bad for the guy. 
 Decided to get him some souvenirs. 
 We go to his room to give them to him. 
 This little kid comes out of the bathroom. 
 She says in English, "You want good time, too?" 
 We get back to the States, we'd look at him, think, "What makes this guy tick that a little kid turns him on?" 
 Fortunately he quit right after that. 
 You still have his computer? 
 Yeah, you want it? 
 We'd love it. 
 Yes. 
 No one here would touch it. 
 He was like a contagion. 
 It's all yours. 
 Who's this? 
 That's him. 
 His computer hasn't been touched for 10 months, so we can forget finding an address for him. 
 But? 
 But, check this out... file names for pictures. 
 "Cirl Love," "Hot 14," "Horny Teen"... 
 He's got text filed called "Diary," "Personal Email," 
 "School Schedules," 
 "Likes," "Dislikes"... each for a couple of dozen girls' names. 
 We can take this to the DA... stalking behavior, illegal p0rn, intent to distribute. 
 That's only if we had the actual files. 
 I thought we did. 
 Only the names. It's like having an inventory list without the inventory. 
 The real stuff is offsite, like the other end of a phone line. 
 He's covering his ass. 
 Let's uncover it. 
 Whose phone line is he using? 
 718 area code, Brooklyn Heights. 
 Van Essian, Keith. 
 Keith. That son of a bitch. 
 I was just squatting his files in my system. It's not even my stuff. 
 It's your system, your house. 
 And it's filled with kiddie p0rn. 
 They're not my files. 
 Doesn't matter. 
 Someone comes to me and wants to store illegal stuff in my garage, he's either my best friend, or I'm getting something out of the deal. 
 He's not my friend. 
 No? What's in it for you then? 
 You're the one with the pictures of her, and the emails, and pictures of dozens of other girls. 
 I don't know how that got there. 
 Do we look like imbeciles to you? 
 They're just pictures. 
 They're not just pictures! 
 These are underage girls. 
 Terrified, drugged and getting photographed without their permission. 
 You little snotnosed son of a bitch, you're going to tell me what I want to know. 
 Now, you got that?! 
 Are those your pictures or aren't they? 
 Yeah. 
 All right, now start explaining. 
 It started small. 
 This one girl... my buddy had a falling out with this girl... so he took some nude photos that he took of her and he put them up on the net to get back at her. 
 And you did him that favor? 
 Yeah. 
 But what we didn't expect was all these guys who emailed us asking everything about her. 
 What kind of guys? 
 Guys who saw the pictures, got turned on, and were willing to pay. 
 And thus, a business was born. 
 First it was just girls we knew, girls we were dating, girls we picked up. 
 But the money was big and it was real. 
 So we started taking requests. 
 They go, "Get me a redhead," or "I'm looking for a flatchested girl." 
 I don't know, these guys are freaks. 
 Yeah, but they got the money, and you're their pimp. 
 I was... I was just giving people what they want. 
 No, that's what I said, you're a pimp. 
 For cyberjohns, you're a pimp. 
 Guys like The Yachtsman. 
 Yeah, him and others. 
 What about the money? 
 They paid in net cash. 
 They paid in credits on websites. 
 It's all untraceable cyberbucks. 
 That was the genius of it. 
 To muddy up the waters. 
 To keep the cops away. 
 Nice try. 
 
 
 
 Okay, so I'm going to go over to Hannah's now. 
 Now? 
 Yeah, I have a history test. 
 It's next Tuesday. 
 Yeah. 
 She can come over here. 
 But she's an only child, it's so much quieter at her place. 
 Over at her mom's or her dad's? 
 Well... why? 
 Why do I want to know who's going to be watching my child? 
 But I don't understand. 
 How do you know all this? 
 How do you know I have a history test next Tuesday? 
 Have you been reading my email? 
 Well... 
 You have, haven't you? 
 I just wanted to find out if someone was sending you things you shouldn't be looking at. 
 Of course they do! 
 I get at least 10 junk emails a day and I delete them all, Dad! 
 What else have you gone through?! 
 Look, I know you think I'm paranoid, Hello? 
 Let's just talk about this. 
 You can tell me anything you want. 
 This is going real well. 
 You want to read my journal, too? 
 No! 
 You have a journal? 
 Unbelievable! 
 This Yachtsman's got a taste for naked pictures. 
 He and everyone else. 
 Number one search term on the lnternet? 
 s*x? 
 Number two. 
 Number one is Pam Anderson. 
 Pam Anderson is well over 18. 
 Those pictures show girls who are not. 
 They could be faked. 
 You know, Catalog pictures digitally altered to make them appear naked. 
 Thank you, John, but I'd just as soon hear him make his rationalizations in person. 
 Except we still don't know where he is. 
 Well, let's trace his email. 
 He's real sharp. 
 He reroutes his sessions so it appears he's logging in from a new location. 
 Kind of a hightech shell game. 
 Then let's make him come to us. 
 We know where he goes on the net. 
 That we do... teenager chat rooms. 
 And we know what he desires. 
 Yeah, Britney Spears, only 10 years younger. 
 Well then, let's give the man what he wants. 
 Yachtsman is on the air. 
 He's explaining to a girl named Marie how to filch Prozac from her mother. 
 Talk to him. 
 Okay, my parents are so harsh. 
 You got him. 
 He says he, like, understands. 
 As if. 
 I wonder if some of these people wouldn't have followed certain instincts... 
 But from the privacy of your home, forbidden is so much easier. 
 He wants to meet in person. 
 Where? 
 A cafe in Chelsea, tomorrow, noon. 
 Excuse me. 
 Hi. 
 I'm The Yachtsman. 
 You must be Nicole. 
 Actually, I'm Nicole. 
 Let's go. 
 You can talk to my lawyer. 
 That's all I'm going to say. 
 What are you charging my client with? 
 Soliciting a minor. 
 I thought he solicited a 48 year old detective. 
 A man named John Munch. 
 He thought it was a 12 year old girl. 
 How do you know that? 
 You'll get a transcript of his chat room pickup lines in the discovery phase. 
 A chat room in which you and your fellow "thought police" were participating? 
 But I suppose you were just working. 
 Excuse me, could I have a word with you, please? 
 Off the record? 
 Sure. 
 Your client was discovered by one of his coworkers having a fling with a 12 year old in Cuba. 
 12, Ms. Hammond. 
 The same people that fired him told you that. 
 He wasn't fired, he quit. 
 And his computer is full of kiddie p0rn. 
 So I'm supposed to give him something less than the best possible legal advice? 
 You have children, Ms. Hammond? 
 I have three nieces. 
 And I understand what you're trying to tell me about my client, but I'm not going to be remiss in my duty as an attorney just because you haven't made a credible case yet. 
 It'll be credible to a jury. 
 She's going to argue that he knew he was talking to an adult the entire time. 
 Role playing, fantasizing, whatever. 
 He solicited minors multiple times. 
 Flesh and blood minors! 
 These are someone's children, for God's sake! 
 Don, I hear you, but two years ago I didn't know my ass from Windows 95. 
 Cyberspace crimes are very, very tough to prosecute. 
 He is a clear threat to society. 
 I know, but we don't have a case! 
 "Altsexteens," 
 "fatherdaughter lovefest," 
 "The MayDecember league." 
 This is how Waters spends his time and still Eastman won't file on him. 
 What does she want? 
 She says a jury might go either way on the soliciting charge, so she kicked it back to us. 
 I'll tell you what, forget about the internet. 
 Bring me a victim Eastman can put on the stand. 
 All we have is what he's done online. 
 Except for his big date with Munch, we have no evidence he ever contacted his little friends. 
 Except for the panty auctions. 
 Whoa, whoa, what is this? 
 He bought panties from little schoolgirls. 
 Perversion by mail, he never bought anything in person. 
 Maybe he was more interested in the return address than in the panties. 
 He bought three pairs from a 15yearold in Queens. 
 Shipped oneday mail in a plain brown wrapper. 
 Home Of Doris Harrington 263 Holland Street, Queens Friday, February 25 
 We're looking for a Doris Harrington. Is she in? 
 No. No, she's not, I'm afraid. 
 Are you her mother? 
 I'm flattered, but I'm a grandmother. 
 Can I ask what you want? 
 Pedophilia, Mrs...? 
 Harrington. 
 You mind if we come in before we all freeze to death, please? 
 Hello, ladies. 
 It's the police. 
 High stakes canasta, do the Mashantucket Pequots know about this? 
 We're not doing anything illegal! 
 Did I say you were? 
 The vibe in here is a tad touchy, Mrs. Harrington. 
 It's not easy getting old. 
 No ageism implied, but we need to talk to your granddaughter. 
 We think she's in danger. 
 Did you read the warrant, Doris? 
 Doris?! 
 You're Doris? 
 Yes, my granddaughter's name is Elaine. 
 She's in school, I hope. 
 May I? 
 No! This isn't Russia! 
 Shut up, Betty. 
 Uh, well, you've heard of the, uh... 
 Beardstown Ladies' Investment Club? 
 Well, we found our own niche. 
 I hope these are your granddaughter's. 
 Of course! 
 We advertise used Homecoming Queen undergarments. 
 That's what we provide. 
 Truth in advertising. 
 I'm sure "Parents" magazine will award you their seal of approval. 
 St. Monica's High School Floral Park, Queens Friday, February 25 
 This is the first time we've had detectives on our campus this year. 
 We pride ourselves on our security here. 
 Metal detectors can only go so far. 
 Which is why I've hired an outside firm to conduct background checks on every teacher, every janitor, every cook. 
 That's a good start. 
 We conduct random locker searches with drug dogs several times a month, enforce a strict dress code, ban all pagers, all cell phones. 
 How about the internet? 
 We make every effort to regulate our students internet usage. 
 Like how? 
 Certain software blocks out certain sites, but you know what kept happening? 
 Computers crashed? 
 One of our students was doing a report on breast cancer... could not access any site featuring the word "breast." 
 Did you remove the block? 
 Our students are most important. 
 At their age, their bodies are constantly changing. 
 It's weird, sometimes scary stuff. 
 But if one of our students wanted to go on the net and get some info on their changing bodies, they'd have to use the anatomical terms... 
 And the software locks it out. 
 So, we locked out the software, which maybe we shouldn't have done. 
 Elaine, this is Detective Stabler, Detective Benson. 
 They'd like to ask you a few questions. 
 What did I do? 
 We just want to know if you know a man named Harry Waters? 
 No. 
 Online he's known as The Yachtsman? 
 Elaine, are you sure that you never heard of him? 
 Do you know him? 
 Yeah. 
 Uhhuh. 
 How do you know him? 
 We... we had a thing. 
 What kind of a thing? 
 Why don't we go somewhere else and talk about it, okay? 
 Let's go. 
 This "thing" between you and Waters, when did it begin? 
 I was just hanging around the house one day when he came by. 
 What was he doing there? 
 He wanted to order more... 
 Panties? 
 Don't worry about that. 
 Your grandmother told us that it was all her idea. 
 I thought it was goofy, kind of funny. 
 But he was really nice. 
 He talked about his own daughter who died in a car crash. 
 Okay, so he came onto you like a father. 
 He was interested in what I was doing in school. 
 What music I liked and what I liked to do for fun. 
 Did he ever ask you how old you are? 
 I told him 14. 
 We had already discussed "The Age of lnnocence" and all that. 
 Elaine, when did it become intimate? 
 September. 
 We met at the park by the fountain. 
 It was a Saturday, so there were a lot of families around. 
 It was nice. 
 My own dad left when I was eight. 
 So then, he took me to this... beautiful restaurant on the river. 
 He made me feel like a princess. 
 Elaine, did he force you to have s*x with him? 
 No. 
 Not really. I mean... he did stuff to himself, but... 
 It's okay, it's over now. 
 It was just... the smell of him... it just... it reminded me of my dad. 
 Have we got anything on this guy, or what? 
 He propositioned her, but no actual s*x. 
 Actual s*x. 
 He flashed her, he perved her in ways she's not even aware of. 
 Okay, how about this: He entered into an improper relationship with a minor. 
 You just said no real s*x... according to her story. 
 He doesn't know that. 
 He doesn't know what she told us. 
 Captain, you're not suggesting we lie to the poor man? 
 Absolutely not. 
 Role playing. 
 Fantasy, makebelieve. 
 That crap he's been pedaling to us about victimless crimes. 
 I'll have him here tomorrow morning. 
 Good morning. 
 What's this about? 
 My client is not going to answer your questions. 
 So you said. 
 Things change. 
 What things? 
 The 14 year old's story. 
 Different, isn't it? when you see the real victim and not some computer generated image, but a real child with a broken heart? 
 At least, that's what the jury'll see. 
 Where can we talk? 
 Harry. 
 Now. 
 Let's start with statutory rape. 
 Then you get to the lesser inclusives, which could include soliciting, sodomy, transporting a minor across state lines. 
 Transporting? 
 She said he took her to the Jersey shore. 
 A nice outing. 
 Completely innocent. 
 If you go federal on this, I'm going to trial. 
 We can stay out of federal courts. 
 How? 
 Give us the names and dates of all his contacts with minors. 
 He had one interaction with one girl. 
 She's the first girl we found. 
 No. 
 He cops to one act with her, he becomes a registered s*x offender, and he joins a program. 
 No, he does time or we're done talking. 
 Let me finish. 
 He does have something to offer. 
 Tempt us. 
 He says he might have the names of other men with the same affliction. 
 What affliction? 
 Pedophilia is recognized by the Psychiatric Board... 
 Come on now, spare us. 
 Elliot, hold on. 
 He's got names? 
 Other pedophiles? 
 Nine of them. 
 He'll deliver them in person. 
 How much time would he serve on s*x with a minor? 
 Up to five years. 
 More with the lesser inclusives. 
 He takes the maximum. 
 That's not a deal. 
 You let me finish. 
 We knock off six months for every pedophile who's convicted. 
 Convicted? 
 What if you screw up? 
 What if the jury doesn't convict them? 
 Hey, then I guess he does the time that he'd be doing anyway. 
 I'll talk to him. 
 How did you meet the others? 
 Well, a couple the old fashioned way. 
 Yeah, what's that? 
 There are certain things you say that a child lover understands that no one else would notice. 
 Such as? 
 All right. 
 Okay. 
 First of all, say I see a guy at a roller rink, my age, but without any kids... just a man by himself. 
 The way he's watching the kids... well, you just know. 
 How do you make contact? 
 Strike up a conversation. 
 Maybe ask him about a "G" rated movie. 
 If he's like me, he's seen them all. 
 So you can relate better to the kids? 
 Rapport is crucial. 
 Like getting their sympathy with that phony story about your poor little daughter's car crash? 
 Yeah, I checked. 
 You're talking "Pocahontas," but really what you're saying is, "Are you a pedophile, too?" 
 That's your term, not ours. 
 "Do you love children?" 
 Is how I'd put it. 
 God, I don't believe this. 
 You want into our world, Detective, believe it. 
 Stop hitting the computer. 
 I can't get on. 
 That's 'cause I put a child lock on there. 
 My homework's on this computer. 
 Okay, I'll take it off. 
 It's not working. 
 Do you know how to fix this? 
 Those child lock things are a joke. 
 That quick, huh? 
 Yes. 
 When are you going to start trusting me? 
 I trust you. 
 Sometimes I bring my work home with me. 
 Right now, I'm chasing a guy out there in... cyberspace, who goes after little girls. 
 You know how I lock up all the doors and windows? 
 Now they're coming in through there. 
 This is about fear. 
 This is not about trust. 
 Stop reading my email. 
 Okay. 
 I promise, and I'm sorry. 
 Benson, Jeffries, and I will be in the storeroom off the main event here, taping and waiting until the bust. 
 Okay, what's the signal? 
 Flash the banquet room lights twice? 
 Great. Munch, Stabler, you'll be in the banquet room with the guests of honor. 
 Where's the line on entrapment? 
 You're not advocating any crime, just getting accounts of crimes already occurred. 
 You can do or say anything. 
 What if they claim they're playacting? 
 That's a risk. 
 We need names of the victims. 
 We need dates. 
 We need them to say as many specific details as possible. 
 So we can follow up and get additional witnesses. 
 The tape itself is not going to convict anybody. 
 What do child molesters talk about when they get together? 
 Arbell's Restaurant And Lounge 790 10th Avenue Monday, February 28 
 The shopping bag cam... excellent! 
 I downloaded an hour of "up their skirts" at the shoe store, but the playground... 
 Hey, there he is. 
 You didn't finish that story. 
 You met him where, at that convention or something? 
 Harry and me? 
 Yeah. 
 "Holiday on lce." 
 Right. 
 I prefer gymnastics. 
 The girls are younger, the outfits tighter. 
 The Swedish horse... don't get me started. 
 You were with that little redhead. 
 What was her name? Astrid? 
 Astrid Brooks. 
 Right. 
 Sweet 16 and the hottest babe I'd ever had. 
 And if I never hear her name again I'll die a happy man. 
 Heartbreak? 
 She got her driver's license, and that's when I learned I was just a glorified taxi service. 
 Sally Ashton. 
 I had this girl Pauline, Pauline Drake. 
 All she wanted was beer and "R" rated movies. 
 How bad is that? 
 She lived in Coop City, didn't she? 
 Yeah. 
 Astrid Brooks, Sally Ashton and Pauline Drake. 
 Let's give it a little time, see if we get more bites. 
 I just want to thank all you guys for coming out tonight. 
 It's always good to be among likeminded people. 
 To Greek philosophers. 
 Hear, hear! 
 You know, I hate to bring business into this, but I have some product in my car if anybody's interested. 
 You'll need a high speed graphics equalizer to download it, but I'm sure that's not going to be a problem. 
 It's not for nothing, McClintock, but those home movies you sold me looked like they were shot by an eightyearold. 
 Alright. Put your hands where we can see them! 
 Okay, party's over! 
 Up against the north wall, now! 
 Now. 
 Let's go, up against the wall, now! 
 Let's go, pal. 
 Slowly, but quietly. 
 I'm FBI. 
 FBI or NAMBLA? 
 Check my breast pocket. 
 Don't you ever badmouth my people in their own stationhouse. 
 Better get used to it, 'cause when I tell Langley how an operation that involved nine regional bureaus got blown, your name is going to be prominently featured. 
 It's spelled CRACEN. 
 And we were doing what we always do, which is to take pedophiles off the street. 
 Four collars at the expense of hundreds more who right now are getting email telling them the cops are onto them. 
 It's a hell of a lot more than you did for us! 
 It was an undercover operation! 
 You were in my city investigating s*x crimes and you didn't give me a heads up! 
 We're dealing with virtual world, which is everywhere and nowhere. 
 But eventually you gotta put real life cuffs on a real life perp! 
 It's not just you. 
 We were in Los Angeles, in Chicago and dozens of other places! 
 It's for the right reason. 
 We wanted to bring in the big predators. 
 That's why the bad guys are running rings around us. 
 Why? 
 Because they're working together... and we're not. 
 Butterflies. 
 Now, how cliche is that? 
 Delicate, shortlived... 
 And easy to catch. 
 Okay, the Brooks girl. 
 Anyone else? 
 Oh, yes, many. 
 The internet has opened a whole word of possibilities. 
 Easy access. 
 No more trees to climb, no binoculars to lug around. 
 You just peek into any little girl's bedroom with a click of your mouse. 
 You see? 
 You see what? 
 You see why the children love me? 
 He's so cold. 
 So angry. 
 The kids from the bad homes, the neglected ones and the abused, when they leave the social worker's office with their anatomically correct dolls, when they leave the police station, they're in tears. 
 What's your point, Wallis? 
 When they leave me, they're all smiles. 
 At any given moment there are 3.4 million anonymous chat room users on the internet.
