 My name is Barry Allen, and I am the fastest man alive. When I was a child, I saw my mother killed by something impossible. 
 Run, Barry, run! 
 My father went to prison for her murder. Then an accident made me the impossible. To the outside world, I'm an ordinary forensic scientist, but secretly I use my speed to fight crime and find others like me, and one day I'll find who killed my mother... Mom! And get justice for my father. I am The Flash. Previously on The Flash... Iris West. I hear you've been writing about me. I've been collecting internet posts about The Streak sightings. Baby, there's no Streak. I saw him, Barry. He wears a red suit. I finally diagnosed why Iris is writing about The Streak. She's doing it for me. I'm gonna find out who really killed Laura, and I'm going to get you out of here. Whoever this Streak is, I am not stopping until the rest of the world believes in him. Maybe we shouldn't see each other for a while. To understand what I'm about to tell you, you need to do something first. You need to believe in the impossible. Can you do that? Good, because all of us, we have forgotten what miracles look like. Maybe because they haven't made much of an appearance lately. Our lives have become ordinary, but there is someone out there who is truly extraordinary. I don't know where you came from. I don't know your name, but I have seen you do the impossible to protect the city I love. So for those of us who believe in you and what you're doing, I just want to say thank you. Hmm. [Exhales] You're welcome. How did you... I literally just hit send. Speed reading. It's crazy what you can do to your voice. You need to stop writing your blog. People need to know that you exist. [Phone ringing] What else can you do? This is not an interview. Come on. You got to give me something. Hobbies, pet peeves, favorite color? Wait, scratch that last one. Red, duh, obviously. You're not hearing me. My hearing is fine. It's just selective. What should I call you? Anything but The Streak. Fine. Suggestions? You said you were writing about me to bring hope to someone you care about. How would he feel if doing that put you in harm's way? He and I aren't exactly on the same page these days. Besides, you're giving hope to a lot of people, so I'm doing this for them. [Sirens blaring] To be continued. Gotta run. Hey! You can't just leave me up... Here. Whoa. Whoo-hoo-hoo! What kind of a tool steals a yellow Humvee? What kind of tool buys a yellow Humvee? Get these people back. I need everybody back! Son! Out of the way! Out of the way! [Gunshots] [Metal impact] What the hell? [Roars] Eddie! Eddie! Yeah! Step out of the vehicle! If you say so. Uh-oh. [Metal impact, bones cracking] [Groans] [Metallic impact] Unh! Looks like you were born to take a beating. Check the math. Your dispersal models don't correlate. Uh, they do if you factor in the seasonal fluctuations in reproduction cycles. What exactly are we debating? The average number of bugs Barry swallows in a day of running. I look forward to seeing you accept your nobel. Barry? Barry? Are you okay? [Gasps] 13 fractures. That's a new record, and that's just in your hand. You also have a concussion, three cracked ribs, and a bruised spleen. Even with your powers, you'll need a few hours to heal. What exactly did you hit? A man. A big, bad man. His skin changed when I hit him. Like, it turned to metal. Interesting. A man of steel. So you went after a meta-human alone? Dude, why didn't you call us? I didn't know what he was. Besides, I was off-duty. Hmm. You're lucky he didn't knock out your teeth. Those puppies don't grow back. The strange thing is I feel like I knew him. What do you mean? He said something that was familiar, but he's gonna hurt someone if we don't stop him. So how do I fight a guy that's made of steel? We will find a way. Tonight, you heal. Yeah. There was lightning in my house. Yellow and red lightning. There was a man in yellow, then I was on the street. I don't know how I got there. Please, you have to believe me! Hey. What happened to you last night? Got beat up by a steel-plated sociopath. Good times. So he is a meta-human? Yeah. That particle accelerator's the gift that keeps on giving. You okay? Relatively. Any idea who he is? Eddie's taking point while I run down a lead. I need you to work with him until I get back. Wait, why me? Because he saw something impossible that he's got questions about, questions that I can't answer. In other words, make up some science-y stuff to throw him off? Exactly. [Scoffs] He stole the Humvee and evaded capture. So pleased you could join us, Mr. Allen. Rough night? Uh, just a little beat, sir. As I was saying, our perp yanked three ATMs after he boosted the vehicle. Atm security cameras caught him on video. We got a hit in the database. Tony woodward. He's got a history of violence, petty theft, assault, going way back to juvie. Dropped off the radar ten months ago. Looks like he's back. [School bell ringing] Increased pressure produces increased heat, and if you don't release it, you get combustion. I don't know how you remember all this stuff, Barry. Because he's a little freak, just like his old man. Don't talk about my dad. Or what? Is he gonna murder me, too? Looks like you were born to take a beating, Allen. Allen. Hey, Allen. Hey. You okay? Hey, yeah. Sorry, Eddie. Listen, I saw something last night I just can't get my head around. Uh-huh. I fired a dozen rounds at our car thief, and it was like they sparked off of him. Huh, well, I mean, he must have been wearing some kind of body armor. On his face? Um... Hey. Barry. Hi, babe, I saw the news. Are you okay? Yeah, I'm fine, which you would know if you checked your messages. I tried you three times. Sorry. I had to work late. Um, so I heard that The Streak saved a kid. Any comment, detective? All I know is our perp got away, but Barry here is gonna help me find him. Yeah. Fine. I have other sources. I will see you tonight. Bye. Bye. What is going on with you two? What do you mean? Nothing, it's fine. It's... I don't know. Okay. [Elevator dings] Dr. Wells. I guess you heard about Barry's incident last night. If you're looking for him I think he's at the station. I actually came here to see you. I need your help solving an old case of mine. What case is that? The murder of Barry's mother. Your childhood nemesis is now an unstoppable meta-human. That is seriously messed up. I had a childhood nemesis. Lexi La Roche. She used to put gum in my hair. Jake Puckett. If I didn't let him copy my homework he'd give me a swirly. Now that we've established that we're all uber-nerds, what are we gonna do about Tony? Glad you asked. We're gonna train you, man. Karate Kid  style. Behold! I call him Girder. For the record, not my idea. Fighting is physics. It's not about strength. It's not about size. It's about energy and power. Channel your speed the right way and you can totally take this bad boy down. Now obviously your Girder is a moving target. So... I have ice and bandages standing by. [Groans] I'm pretty sure I just dislocated my shoulder. [Groans] Okay, not gonna lie. This is gonna be quick but extremely painful. [Phone ringing] Oh, speaking of pain. Eddie, hey. Allen, we found the stolen Humvee in the alley at Fremont and Lawrence. Need you down here to do your thing. Great. I'll see you in a sec. Okay. Okay. Let's do this. So Barry, when you said you were off-duty last night, you weren't visiting Iris again. You know, in disguise? 'Cause that would be reckless and a little creepy. No. Good. [Joint pops] [Screams] Allen, you really need a car. I usually manage on foot okay. What do we got? The rig Tony woodward boosted last night. No sign of the stolen ATMs. Probably got those where he's holed up, though he's gonna have one hell of a time breaking 'em open. I wouldn't be so sure. So, about you and Iris... Look, Eddie, we had a fight, and I just don't really feel comfortable talking about it with you. I get that, and I get that you two go way back. To be honest, I was a little threatened by you at first. You were threatened by me? Sure. I mean, I've seen how close you two are, but you seem like a good guy, and Iris, I just want her to be happy. From my experience, good friends are hard to find. Detective. Excuse me. Sir, we ran the plates on that Humvee... Come on, Barry! You can do it! Barr, focus! I am! Son, son, son. You're getting frustrated. You need to learn how to control your emotions. Iris, come here, sweetie. You want me to hit a girl? He wants you to try. Relax, Barry. I've had her in gloves since she was six. She's tougher than she looks. Sorry, Barry. Son... Sometimes the best way to win a fight is not to start one, but if you do come up against somebody you know you can't beat, be smart. It's okay to run the other way. All right? So what do you think? Judging by the mud and kegs I'd say he got hammered, stole a big-ass truck, and went joyriding. I bet the kegs are stolen, too. Rusty Iron Ale, it's a micro brewed right over in... Keystone, I know the place. Let's check it out. Yeah. Barry described a tornado of red and yellow lightning inside a man in yellow. Then, bam. He's blocks away on the street. Doesn't know how he got there. When I arrived, the place was a wreck. Nora Allen is dead. Single stab wound to the heart. Henry Allen covered in her blood. And despite all the evidence that Henry Allen is guilty, now you believe this... What, man in yellow is responsible? Last night, I saw Barry rescue a young boy from being run over, and it looked exactly like what Barry described happened to him. It got me thinking, what if somebody with Barry's abilities killed Nora? There's one flaw with your theory though, detective, and is that all of this happened 14 years ago, which is long before... Your machine gave Barry his powers. An accident gave Barry his powers. Do you think it is possible that somebody with Barry's super-speed could have existed before the explosion? Detective, I deal in probabilities as a scientist, and in this case... It's highly unlikely. Gentlemen, CCPD. Any chance some of your merchandise was stolen last night? No, I don't think so. How about this guy? You seen him? You know Tony, don't you? Hey. Allen, come on! Allen, you okay? Oh, never better. Get up. I didn't do nothing, man! So why'd you run? Look, it was an accident! What was? Tony falling, okay? But I swear to God, we didn't kill him! Keep talking. About ten months ago, Keystone Ironworks. Boss is handing out pink slips. Tony gets his, and he just snapped. He started beating the crap out of the guy. We pulled him off, and then the lights went out. Some kind of power surge. And then Tony went over the railing right into a vat of molten scrap. Just gone. Lucky for you he's still alive. What? How'd you get in front of us? Shortcut. ♪ When I was just a boy, my mama...♪ I've been meaning to ask you, where's your shadow? What shadow? Barry. He hasn't been in all week. Getting his fix somewhere else. Too bad. He's cute, I kind of miss having him around. Iris? Long time no see. I got to say, Iris, you look amazing. Thanks, Tony. Um, you too. Oh, yeah. I keep in shape. I got a gym at my place. Been living out in Keystone on he West Side, and you should, uh... You should stop by sometime. So, uh, can I get you a drink? No, I came to see you. How did you know I was here? I've been reading up on The Streak. Found your little blog. Why are you writing about this guy? People say that he's a hero. I say he's a coward, and I happen to know that he took a beating last night and ran off like a little girl. You should write about that. Do you have any idea who leather boy is? No clue. So, um, if you don't want a drink I should probably get back to work. Actually I'd prefer to buy you a drink. What time you off? Thanks, Tony, but I don't think my boyfriend would approve. He's a cop, like my dad. I never really did like cops too much. Iris! Well he's picking me up for the policeman's ball. Wall to wall cops. Can't swing a cat. I should probably call him to see where he is... Give me the phone, Iris. Now! I'm sorry. Uh, for the damage. We'll pick this up some other time. 
 
 [Breathes heavily] Barry! Check it out! The gravel you pulled from Tony's ride? It contains 76.8% hematite. Consistent with the mines at Keystone Ironworks. Which closed down ten months ago. It's the perfect hideout. Barry, do you mind telling me about this? "I have info about someone you're looking for. He was here. You know where to find me." Now who could she be talking to? I guess you got my message. Are you okay? Cop's daughter. I can handle myself. Not with this guy. I knew him when we were kids. He didn't want to hurt me. He wanted to impress me, but he is fixated on you, and not in a good way. Do you know where he went? He said he had a place out in west Keystone. Bragged about how big it was, but I have no idea where. I do. Wait, there's something else. His hand. It transformed like an iron fist. He's like you, isn't he? Yes, and writing about me is what brought him to you. I know, but maybe I could talk... No! He's too dangerous. [Knocking on glass] Damn, that's my ride. Eddie insisted on a detail. [Whoosh] I have to... Go. Barry, talk to us. What are you doing? Dude, don't run angry. We don't know how to defeat him yet. This is definitely the place. You're trespassing, freak! There's nowhere left to run. Barry? Barry, where are you? Caitlin, over here! Barry? Please, say something! Say something so we know you're okay. Ow. Get him out of there! What were you thinking? What were you thinking? I told you that we would figure out a way to deal with him. I'll heal. You can't heal when you're dead. He could have killed you. I know, all right? I know! In the past 36 hours I've had my ass handed to me twice by the guy that tortured me as a kid. I couldn't stop him then, and I can't stop him now! Even with my powers I'm still powerless against him. Not necessarily. Cisco? Any material, if struck at a high enough velocity can be compromised. We ran an analysis on the metal in Tony's footprint. Based on its density and atomic structure, if you impact it at just the right angle, at just the right speed, you could do some serious damage. How fast would I have to go? Factoring in the metal's tensile strength, estimated dermal thickness, atmospheric pressure, air temp, you'd have to hit him at approximately... Mach 1.1. You want Barry to hit something at 800 miles an hour? 837, actually. That's faster than the speed of sound. I know. He would create a sonic boom, which, as I've said before, would be awesome. I've never gone that fast. Yet. I can't believe we're actually entertaining this idea. I mean, he'd need a straight shot from Miles away yeah, 5.3 Miles, theoretically. Do it right, you'll take him down. Do it wrong, you'll shatter every bone in your body. Barry. Joe, I've been beaten up enough for one day. I gotta... Hey, wait. An anonymous tip led us to Tony Woodward's hideout. The place was trashed. What happened? He shows up at Jitters to see Iris. I had to go after him. Iris, where is she? She's fine, she's fine. Eddie put a detail her to be safe. I thought I could handle him this time. I tried. Look, I know what this punk put you through, but you can't let emotion cloud your judgment. The tollbooth camera got a shot of Woodward. Stolen car headed out of town. State police are taking over. We lost him. Don't worry, Eddie. They'll get him. I wanted to take this guy down. Not half as much as I did. Let's go, Allen. Go where? Blow off some steam. I need to hit something. What? I don't think he meant hit you. Go. So I heard you and this Woodward guy have a history. Hey, Allen. It's okay. Trust me. I had my fair share of bullies at school. Yeah, somehow I find that hard to believe. I was short, fat, and the son of a politician who closed the factory in my school district, so not so popular. So what'd you do about it? I got my ass kicked. A lot, until my gym coach took pity on me. She said the key to fighting is patience. Here. A lot of guys waste energy trying to land the most punches. All it takes is one, but you got to make it count. Choose your spot and drive through it, like it's six inches behind the target. Harder. Harder! [Coughs] The seam was starting to split. [Chuckles] Appreciate you coming down. Hmm, well these days it's rare to find someone happy to have a drink with me. Well, our conversation yesterday got me thinking. You said, as a scientist, you look for the probable? That's right. And we both recently have seen things that have redefined what is possible. Yes, we have, and we both know the direct cause of those things. Your accelerator explosion. Evolutionary leaps follow the creation of new technologies. It's that simple. Like the Roomba. [Laughs] Yes, like the Roomba. So humor me here. Hmm? If we know that meta-humans were created by the particle accelerator and testimony shows that a meta-human may have been involved in the murder of Barry Allen's mother 14 years ago, it seems to me that... Way back then there must have been another particle accelerator. Another particle accelerator? Hmm. I can assure you that's extremely unlikely, detective, and if they were I don't recall any dark matter lightning storms before I moved to town. Do you? No, no, I don't. When did you move to town, Dr. Wells? Something tells me that you already know the answer to that question, detective. This whole "help me solve the murder of Nora Allen," you were never looking for my help, were you? You opened your lab a month after Nora Allen's murder. Would you mind telling me what you were doing in Central City before that? I was starting over. Starting what over? Here I thought we were just two guys having a friendly drink. You want answers, detective? Tess Morgan, look her up. [Exhales] Unit 52, this is dispatch. Requesting status update on the West house. Unh! Hey, Iris. Nice, Allen. Yeah. All right. Okay. Hey, next time work on your speed. Yeah, I'll do my best. Thawne, Allen. The unit watching Joe's daughter, they've been attacked. Iris is missing. Go, all right? I'll call Joe. Let's adjust the impact angle by 2 degrees, up the speed to 838. Bam. Ouch. Ouch? Guys, you there? Yeah, man, what's up? Tony took Iris. I need you to do whatever you can to help me find her. All right? Satellites, security cameras. Hack 'em all. We're on it. What's wrong? Remember this place, Iris? So what's the plan here, Tony? You finally gonna go for that G.E.D? You want a plan? How's this? You used to write about The Streak, right? Now you're gonna write about me. You just abducted me, Tony. Why would I do that? Because The Streak is dead. No. Squashed like a little bug by me. So if you don't want the same thing to happen to you, you're gonna tell the whole world that there's a new big man on campus! And I'm just getting started. You could have anybody write about you, Tony. Why me? 'Cause I like you, Iris. Always have. You should have said something. [Fire alarm blaring] You try anything like that again and I'm gonna leave more than a bruise! Eddie, anything yet? We have roadblocks on every major artery. Units are searching. We will find Iris, Joe. You don't think he'll hurt her, do you? Sir, sir, we got a fire alarm call at Carmichael Elementary. Dispatch the fire department. We'll send backup when we can. That's the school you and Iris went to. And Tony. Go. Tony, turn yourself in before things get worse. It's not too late. Yeah, it is. Cops are already looking for me, so get ready to cover the showdown of a lifetime 'cause I'm not going out without a fight. Good, 'cause you just found one. You just won't stay dead. Come to save your little fan girl? This is between us. Let her go. Oh, I could, but I'd rather make her watch while I break every bone in your body. Wait here. Okay. Too slow, tin man. Aah! I've known guys like you. Peaked in high school. Never got over it. All these powers, and look at you! Bully then, bully now. He's hurt. No! If you do come up against somebody you know you can't beat, be smart. It's okay to run the other way. There goes your hero. He made it out. Barely. Why did he stop? He's miles away. 5.3 miles away. Barry, wait! No way. He's gonna do it! Go, man, go! [Car alarms blaring] [Sonic boom] Unh! Supersonic punch, baby! Whoo! [Moans] [Grunts] Nice cross. Yeah, I think I broke my hand. Oh, me too. Hey! What is this? Where the hell am I? Somewhere you'll never hurt anyone ever again. Who the hell do you think you are? You know who I am. Allen? The thing that happened to you, Tony, it happened to me too, but it didn't just give us abilities. It made us more of who we are. You got strong. I got fast. Fast enough to beat you. You used your gift to hurt people. Not anymore. Allen. Allen. Allen, don't walk away from me, Allen! Hey! Come back here! Allen! Allen! Dude, that had to feel great. You have no idea. Almost as good as proving me wrong about the supersonic punch? Actually, that part hurt. Like, a lot. But I couldn't have done it without you guys. All I want to know is which childhood bully are we gonna take down next? Mine or Caitlin's? Okay, yeah. I vote mine. What? Guys, this is not a joke. Doctor. Detective. Are you here to make more accusations? I'm here to make amends. I looked up Tess Morgan. I'm sorry for your loss. You two were research partners in Maryland? Yes, we were. We were... Married to the work as much as to each other. After the car accident... I could not go back to the work. Could not go back to our lab. So you moved here. Where no one knew me. Where no one could remind me of what I had lost, and, um... I... I found it difficult, starting over, rebuilding, and what took me 14 years Tess could have done in 4, believe me, she... She... At the time of Nora Allen's murder, the particle accelerator that I would eventually create was but a notion, much less a reality, and so whomever or whatever is responsible for her death, it did not originate from me or from my work. I'm sorry I doubted you, but I hope I can still count on your help. [Chuckles] You don't give up, do you? Nope. Not till I get my man. I owe that to Barry and to Henry. Barry is lucky to have you on his side, Joe. [Pop music playing] ♪ ♪ Hi. Oh, I thought that you were someone else. So Joe told me what happened. How's the hand? Not broken, so that's something. I should have believed... I'm sorry I said... I've missed you. Yeah, I've missed you too. When I heard Tony took you, I... I just... I don't know what I would do if anything happened to you. Well, my guardian angel's looking out for me. Do you want to hang out and catch up? Yeah. I would like that, yeah. I promise not to talk about The Streak tonight. No, I want you to. No, I mean, I want... You can... I want you to talk about whatever you'd want to talk about. I knows important to you. Good because it's not just The Streak. There are others out there that are like him. I've gotten scattered posts about this guy that's on fire, except that he doesn't burn up. Okay, so wait. Wait. You're trying to find The Burning Man now too? Yeah, why not? I mean, a lot can happen in a week, especially with The Streak. Heh. I've been trying to get answers from him. Where does he come from? How does he do what he does? But he dodges everything. Literally, with this super-speed power. When he moves, Barry, you don't even see him. He comes and goes in the blink of an eye, in a... Flash? In a Flash. Yeah. Today, I was saved by the impossible. A mystery man. The fastest man alive. Then a friend gave me an idea for a new name, and something tells me it's gonna catch on. [Power shutting off] [Glass shatters]
