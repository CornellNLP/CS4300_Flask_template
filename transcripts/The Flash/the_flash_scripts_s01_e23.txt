 My name is Barry Allen, and I am the fastest man alive. 
 When I was a child, I saw my mother killed by something impossible. 
 My father went to prison for her murder. 
 Then an accident made me the impossible. 
 To the outside world, I am an ordinary forensic scientist, but secretly, I use my speed to fight crime and find others like me. 
 And one day, I'll find who killed my mother and get justice for my father. 
 That day is today. 
 What? No Big Belly Burger? 
 It's one of the few perks of living in this time. 
 We're out of cows where I come from. 
 You don't care about that. 
 You have questions. Go ahead. 
 Not sure where to start... Thawne. 
 That is your real name... Eobard Thawne. 
 Since the day I was born. 
 And when was that? 
 136 years from now. 
 That's not what you want to know. 
 Go ahead, Barry. 
 Ask it. 
 Why did you kill my mother? 
 Because I hate you. 
 Not you now. You years from now. 
 In the future. 
 In a future. Yes. 
 We're enemies, rivals, opposites, reverses of one another. 
 Why? Wh-why were we enemies? 
 It doesn't matter. 
 It doesn't... matter anymore. 
 What matters is that neither of us was strong enough to defeat the other. 
 Until I learned your secret. 
 I learned your name. 
 Barry Allen. 
 And finally, I knew how to defeat you once and for all. 
 Travel back in time, kill you as a child. 
 Wipe you from the face of the earth. 
 But then you, future you, that is, followed me back, and we fought. 
 We both landed some pretty solid shots. 
 And then you, future you, got your younger self out of there. 
 I was so mad. 
 But then I thought... what if you were to suffer a tragedy? 
 What if you were to suffer something so horrible, so traumatic that your child self could never recover? 
 Then you would not become The Flash. 
 And so I stabbed your mother in the heart, and I was free. 
 Finally able to return to a future without The Flash, only to realize that in traveling back I'd lost my way home. 
 Lost my ability to harness the speed force. 
 And without it, I was stuck here. 
 Stranded in this time, unable to return to my own. 
 And the only way back was The Flash. 
 But The Flash was gone, and so I created him. 
 Why train me? 
 Why help me save so many people? 
 Because I needed you to get fast. 
 Fast enough to rupture the space-time barrier and create a stable wormhole through which I could return home. 
 Why would I ever do that? 
 Because... 
 Barry Allen, if you give me what I want, I'm gonna give you what you want. 
 You can go back and save your mother. 
 You can prevent your father from going to prison. 
 You can reunite the Allen family. 
 No. 
 No, I don't believe you. 
 I want to kill you right now. 
 I know that rage. 
 I used to feel that rage every time I looked upon you. 
 And now, somehow, I know what Joe and Henry feel when they look on you with pride. 
 With love. 
 No. No. 
 Don't you ever say that to me! 
 I know you're upset, but I'm giving you a chance. 
 I'm giving you a chance to undo all the evil I've done. 
 Don't you want that chance? 
 The rare opportunity to go back in time and right a wrong and save your mother's life... quite the paradox Harrison has presented you with, Mr. Allen. 
 The chance to be with someone you love? 
 Seems pretty cut and dry to me. 
 Stein : At first blush, Dr. Snow, it would appear so, but this gift has unparalleled risk. 
 Barry, the night your mother died, the night you saved yourself from being killed, that event altered the timeline you were already on and changed the course of history. 
 So what you're saying is we're living in a parallel universe? 
 Just like when I time traveled before. 
 But he... he only changed one day that time. 
 Exactly. Now imagine 15 years of compounded experiences. 
 One different decision, no matter how big or small, impacts everything that follows. 
 Moments upon moments, choices upon choices. 
 No relationships, nothing would be as it is today, and you'd never know the difference because you'd never remember any of it. 
 So if I go back and save my mom, my dad doesn't go to prison. 
 I never live with Joe and Iris. 
 You might never meet me. Or Caitlin or Ronnie. 
 Truth is, there's no real way of knowing what your life will be. 
 There's no choice here, Barry. You have to do this. 
 You gotta change the past. 
 Joe? 
 So what... what, that's it? 
 You think I should just do it? 
 Yeah, I do. 
 Which means I will never come to live with you, and... you're okay with that? 
 Barry, you get the chance to grow up with both parents. 
 You don't have to grow up without a mother. 
 What about growing up without a father? 
 You will have a father... your real father. 
 Wells has messed with our lives long enough. 
 This is why you became The Flash, Barry. 
 To put things right. 
 You saved a lot of people's lives this past year. 
 Now it's time to save yours. 
 Barry : Dad, look. I know this sounds crazy. 
 I think we're way past crazy, slugger. 
 Look, you're fast, I get it. But turning back time... 
 No, I wouldn't be turning time back. 
 I would be... going back to that night to save her. 
 And what does Joe think about all this? 
 [chuckles] 
 He thinks I should do it. 
 No. 
 You can't. 
 Dad... 
 I can make it so that night will never have happened. 
 We'll be a family again. 
 We are a family. 
 Not like this. Not without Mom. 
 Barry, there's a natural order to things, okay? 
 Things happen the way they do. 
 We may not know why at the time, but there must always be a reason. 
 Now, I believe that. I've had to believe it. 
 I... I can save Mom. 
 At what cost? 
 You said time would change. What if it changes you? 
 I don't care. 
 I do. 
 I am in awe of the remarkable man that you are becoming... all the things you've achieved, and not just as The Flash, but you, Barry. 
 Your honesty. Your heart. 
 You were always a hero. 
 And your mom would be just as proud. 
 And if she had a say in this, if she thought for one second that you going back to save her would mean you losing what makes you so special, she would never want that. 
 [crying] 
 Barry, what I hope for you, maybe the greatest thing that a father can hope for his son is that one day, you will become a father yourself. 
 And then you will know... 
 How much I truly love you. 
 [thermometer beeps] 
 Caitlin : 98.6. Normal. 
 I don't even know what that word means anymore. 
 Me neither. 
 I know Barry really appreciates you coming back to help him stop Wells. 
 That's not the only reason I'm back, Cait. 
 I'm here now. For good. 
 But I thought... 
 I thought too... I thought too much about what might happen if the government tracked us down. 
 If we couldn't control our powers and we hurt someone. 
 If we hurt you. 
 But I realized that although sometimes I'm more than one man, I'm not whole unless I'm with you. 
 I love you, Cait. 
 Are you sure? 
 I am. 
 Once upon a time and a Particle Accelerator or so ago, you agreed to marry me. 
 Yes, I did. 
 What do you say we do that? 
 Thought I might find you here. 
 I needed to get out of the lab. 
 [sighs] 
 I thought this would be a good place to think. 
 Oh, it is. Trust me. 
 I've done a lot of thinking up here. 
 When I wasn't having clandestine meetings with the mysterious "streak." 
 [both chuckle] 
 Yeah, not mad we lost that name. 
 Hey, I thought that had pizzazz. 
 [both laugh] 
 No. 
 Uh-uh. 
 [gentle music] 
 So are you gonna do it? 
 It's just so...huge. 
 It's the biggest decision of my life, and if I'm wrong, I can't undo it. 
 Why would you want to? 
 I mean, you'd get to see your mom again, your dad, have a great career, even get married. 
 Iris West-Allen, huh? 
 I never really thought of myself as a hyphenator. 
 Must be a 2024 thing. [chuckles] 
 We don't know that that's going to happen. 
 Do you think that because you didn't live with us, that's why things are different there? 
 Growing up together and... knowing so much about each other... it made it hard for me to admit how I felt about you. 
 And I waited too long, and you fell in love with Eddie. 
 But living with you and Joe... 
 I've had a great life, Iris. 
 Come here, Barry. 
 What do you think I should do? 
 I need someone to tell me. 
 I think... that for once in your life, Barry Allen, you should stop thinking about other people. 
 I think you should do what's in your heart. 
 Do what you need to do for yourself. 
 Wells : Ah! 
 Well, if it makes you feel any better, it took you a whole hour longer to decide than I thought it would. 
 So how does this work? 
 Your grand plan? 
 Well, it's really not that grand at all, Barry. 
 In fact, it's rather simple. 
 We use the Particle Accelerator. 
 [laughs] The Particle Accelerator. 
 The last time that happened, you caused an explosion that hurt a lot of people. 
 This time, the accelerator will operate exactly the way it was designed to. 
 Except, instead of two particles moving in opposite directions, colliding at the speed of light in the inner ring, we're only going to inject one particle into the accelerator. 
 And I'm what it collides with. 
 And if you can go fast enough, Barry, if you can hit that particle with enough speed, you will punch a hole right though the fabric of reality. 
 And you will create a portal connecting this time to infinite times. 
 A wormhole. 
 Through which one might travel back to the past, say, to the night your mother died or forward to the future, to, say, my time. 
 You said  if  I run fast enough. 
 What happens if I don't? 
 If you don't achieve the desired velocity barrier, you'll die. 
 According to Wells' calculations, Barry super-speeds inside the accelerator ring. 
 Once Barry reaches optimum speed, we then launch a hydrogen proton into the accelerator. 
 Once the collision happens, a wormhole forms, opening a gateway into time itself. 
 It's at that moment I plan on shouting something along the lines of "Eureka" or possibly "Excelsior." 
 I'm uncommitted. 
 What do you think? 
 [sighs] I mean, on the one hand, it does make a kind of sense. 
 On the other hand, why? 
 Why, why would you ever consider doing this? 
 You know why. 
 So, for this to actually work, how fast would Barry have to go? 
 By my estimates, Mach Two at a minimum. 
 You've never gone that fast. 
 So what happens if Barry doesn't reach that speed? 
 I mean, I'm imagining a bug hitting a windshield. 
 How far off am I? 
 Not very far, I'm afraid. 
 Let me worry about how fast I have to go. 
 We're gonna need something else too. 
 Really? And what's that? 
 'Cause I don't know about you guys, but I'm not at all interested in helping you get yourself killed. 
 I need you to build a time machine. 
 Go on. 
 So, if Wells is as fast as you, what's he need a time machine for? 
 Apparently he lost his speed when he killed my mom. 
 He gets it back sometimes but only in spurts. 
 He can't fully control it. 
 So I was right about the wheelchair. 
 He was using it to charge himself. 
 So after I open the wormhole, he's gonna need the ship to travel back to the future. 
 He's been squirreling away the parts. 
 Now we just need to put it together. 
 Ronnie, I love you, but this is a time machine, not a bookcase from IKEA. 
 We got a problem. 
 These tiles... they're made of tungsten. 
 Well, tungsten does have the highest melting point of any other element. 
 Yeah, but the dust it generates is flammable. 
 The pressure exerted from the wormhole... 
 Yeah. Yeah. 
 It could cause a hole to be melted into the exterior. 
 It could explode. 
 Any ideas? 
 Let me ask Dr. Evil. [chuckles] 
 Which used to be a name that made me smile. 
 Wells : Something on your mind, Cisco? 
 No. 
 Yes. 
 How did you fit your Reverse-Flash suit into that little ring? 
 Is it some sort of compressed micro tech? 
 Or actually, forget it. I don't care. 
 Maybe a little. 
 Ronnie's right. 
 I should have accounted for the temporal shearing. 
 Glad we're still good for something. 
 I never underestimated your contribution, Cisco. 
 Or Ronnie's. 
 As a matter of fact, do you know how many times I wished you were there with me as I rebuilt the accelerator? 
 It would have been a lot more fun. 
 Yeah? 
 Well, doesn't change the fact that your nifty little Time Sphere... 
 Is that what you're calling it? 
 Whatever it's called. It's gonna blow. 
 Not if you cement the tiles with a cobalt resin. 
 That'll prevent degradation in conditions of extreme heat. 
 Okay. Fine. We'll try that. 
 Wells : That's it? That's all? 
 Well, what do you want me to say? 
 I don't know, Cisco. 
 I thought that of anyone, you'd be a little more understanding of my predicament. 
 I don't belong here. 
 These barbaric times. 
 It's like living amongst the dead. 
 Is that what you told yourself? When you killed me? 
 What? 
 What did you say? 
 It was an alternate timeline. 
 One that Barry reset. 
 But I never forgot it. 
 It just kept coming back to me. 
 And I can still picture the way you looked at me when you called me a son and you crushed my heart with your fist. 
 Cisco... 
 I'm sorry. 
 Yeah. It sucked. 
 Not for killing you. I'm sure I had a good reason. 
 I'm sorry for the fact that you're able to retain traces of another timeline. 
 You're able to see through the vibrations of the universe. 
 It means... 
 I wasn't sure until just now. 
 Sure of what? 
 The night the Particle Accelerator exploded... 
 You were affected too. 
 What are you talking about? 
 No. 
 I wasn't. 
 Don't be afraid, Cisco. 
 A great and honorable destiny awaits you now. 
 I only hope that as you're living your great adventure, that you remember who gave you that life. 
 And that it was given out of love. 
 
 
 
 [ominous music] 
 I'm sorry, but I'm told this is the only station with enough power to run these calculations. 
 If we make the slightest error creating the wormhole... 
 Say no more. 
 Joe told me to stick around in case I was needed, but it seems I'm only in the way. 
 Everyone has a contribution to make. 
 Perhaps you just haven't discovered yours yet. 
 No, Dr. Wells made it pretty clear when he told me about the future. 
 I don't matter. 
 As far as history's concerned, I don't save the day or get the girl. 
 And you believed him? 
 He had a newspaper from the year 2024. 
 And I have a mug that says "World's Best Boss." 
 I doubt my teaching assistant would testify to its authenticity. 
 We're dealing with a lot of big scientific ideas today. 
 But you, Mr. Thawne, might be the most interesting thing here at S.T.A.R. Labs. 
 Me? 
 What are the odds that Dr. Wells would travel back in time and get stuck in the exact same city as his great-great-great- great-grandfather? 
 Working in the same profession, the same building? 
 And that part of his plan to get home would mean that he'd have to preserve and protect your life. 
 That makes you this rare thing that no scientist can plan for. 
 Which is? 
 Coincidence. 
 There is no science to coincidence. 
 You, sir, are an anomaly. 
 A wild card, as it were. 
 You are the only person in this whole story who gets to choose his own future. 
 At least, that's my opinion. 
 [computer blips] 
 Wait, that can't be right. 
 Oh, dear. 
 We have a problem. 
 What? 
 Stein : The calculations. There is a danger. 
 I know. I'm ready to take the risk. 
 No, not just to you but to everyone. 
 Wells didn't tell us everything. 
 Barry, even if you do reach the right speed, colliding with the hydrogen particle, there is a chance that explosion could create a singularity. 
 What's a singularity? 
 It's a black hole. 
 We could destroy Central City. 
 For starters. 
 If we create a singularity here and then cannot control it, we could be looking at a global catastrophe. 
 So long and thanks for all the fish. 
 Wells : Well, sure, there's a bit of a risk. 
 Stein : I would hardly refer to possibly causing an extinction-level event as "a bit of a risk." 
 West : Yeah, and your accelerator's been about as reliable as the beater I drove in high school. 
 [chuckles] 
 Let me ask you a question. 
 How many meta-humans... how many dangers... have we faced this year together? 
 Or did you forget that was me fighting alongside each and every one of you? 
 I have been planning this for almost two decades. 
 It will work. 
 And how do we make sure we don't open a black hole in the middle of Central City? 
 So, once the wormhole stabilizes, Barry will have 1 minute and 52 seconds to alter the past and return to this time. 
 If and when he does that, you can close the wormhole, and we can all live happily ever after. 
 Almost two minutes. 
 More than enough time to save Nora. 
 But not enough time to stop you from going home? 
 Everything's a choice. 
 And what if I'm late? 
 You won't be. I believe in you, Barry. 
 Always have. 
 So I guess the question is, do your friends and family believe in you as much as I do? 
 [sighs] 
 [laughs] 
 So, if I don't run fast enough to collide with the particle, then I'm dust, and if I do run fast enough but I'm not back here in time, then a black hole will form, swallow up the city and possibly the world. 
 You're sure you still want to look me in the eyes and tell me this is for the best? 
 I'd be lying if I told you I did. 
 [laughs] 
 Truth is, I don't... I don't know what to think. 
 I thought you were the sure one. 
 I... was kind of banking on that when I made my decision the first time. 
 I was faking it. 
 Sometimes parents do that. 
 Most of the time, parents do that. 
 Look, of course I'm scared. 
 But I didn't want you to not help your mother because you were worried about me. 
 Well, I'll always worry about you, Joe, just like you'll always worry about me. 
 Sorry, but you can't stop that. 
 [sighs] 
 Do you think I can do this? 
 You think I can save my mom? 
 I mean, do you think I'm fast enough? 
 Yes. 
 I know you are. 
 You know, I've... I've dreamed my whole life about... saving her, freeing my dad, and... 
 I never thought I'd have to lose another parent to do that. 
 Barry... 
 Joe, it's true. It's true. 
 I've always been so focused on everything that I lost that night, but I gained so much too. 
 I was born with one father, and that tragedy gave me... another. 
 And I don't think I can lose you. 
 You won't ever lose me. 
 Ever, you hear me? 
 Ever. 
 Wow, slow news day? 
 If they only knew, right? 
 I thought you would be at S.T.A.R. Labs. 
 I was. 
 Then I got hungry, so I went to Mama Chows. 
 For dim sum? Your favorite. 
 And to remind myself of something. 
 What? 
 A coincidence. A pretty big coincidence, actually. 
 About a year and a half ago, I had a date with this girl. 
 Katie Rogers. She was a dancer. 
 We had plans to meet at Mama Chows, but she texted me. 
 She pulled a hamstring and had to cancel. 
 Oh, those fragile dancers. 
 I was bummed 'cause I was looking forward to it. 
 So I had dinner by myself, and I was walking home when I saw a mugger running with a stolen backpack. 
 Your backpack. 
 And I arrested him. 
 That's how you and I met. 
 I remember. 
 Someone just told me how powerful a coincidence can be, and it made me realize how many coincidences had to happen for you and I to get together... in this time. 
 We've all been so focused on Barry's destiny, I forgot that I have one too. 
 And it's you. 
 Iris West, every moment of my life led to meeting you. 
 Screw the future. 
 [laughs] 
 Screw the future. 
 [pop music] 
 Ronnie : Is this actually binding? 
 Stein : My father made me become a rabbi before he would send me to MIT. 
 This will be "legit," as the kids say. 
 No kids say that. 
 Let's not fight on our wedding day.

 [sighs] 
 If it's all right with everyone, I'd like to skip all the Hebrew. 
 [chuckles] 
 I've learned a lot about merging one's life with another this past year. 
 Yet, for all the incredible advancements in science we've all been party to, the mystery that brings two people together through love is still the province of magic.

 Okay. 
 There are gonna be three yous back there... the you from the future who saved younger you from the Reverse-Flash and now  you  you. 
 Remember, wait until future you gets younger you out of there, and then you can go and save your mom. 
 Piece of cake. 
 May the Speed Force be with you. 
 Good-bye, Dad. 
 Good-bye, Son. 
 Iris... 
 You don't have to say anything. 
 I already know. 
 I hope whatever life you get, it's enough for you. 
 That it makes you happy. 
 You too. 
 Stein : Remember, Mr. Allen, assuming you achieve the proper velocity and open the wormhole, you will only have 1 minute and 52 seconds to save your mother and return. 
 Or else... 
 Flash : I know. 
 Well... you hold both our futures in your hands now, Mr. Allen. 
 And I know you can do it. 
 Now... 
 Run... 
 Barry. 
 Run. 
 [heroic music] 
 The accelerator's structural integrity is holding. 
 What was that? 
 Is Barry okay? 
 Yeah. He just passed Mach Two. 
 Iris : I was waiting for you to bring Barry home. 
 Looks like he's going to be staying with us for a while. 
 Wells : Barry, what you're seeing is the Speed Force: your past, you present, your future all at once. 
 So you need to focus on where you want to go. 
 So think about... that night. 
 Think about your mother. 
 Henry : Time for bed. Good night, slugger. 
 young Barry : Mom! 
 [Nora and young Barry shouting] 
 It's working. 
 It's working. 
 Inject the hydrogen particle now. 
 What's that? What happened? 
 Barry... he's gone. 
 Look. 
 The wormhole. 
 And it's stable. Start the clock. 
 [gasps] 
 [ethereal music] 
 young Barry : Mom! 
 Mom! 
 Barry! 
 Mom! 
 [screaming] 
 Nora! Hold on! 
 [slow motion] Run, Barry, run! 
 Barry, no! 
 No, no, no! 
 [knife pierces flesh] 
 [Nora screams] 
 [clang] 
 [whoosh] 
 [Nora whimpering] 
 Hey. It's okay. It's okay. You're okay. 
 Please. My husband, my son, are they... 
 They're okay. 
 They're both safe. 
 I promise. 
 Who are you? 
 I'm... 
 I'm The Flash. 
 I don't understand. 
 You look just like my father. 
 This won't make any sense, but it's me, Mom. 
 [laughs softly] 
 It's Barry. 
 Barry? 
 Your Barry. 
 Oh, my beautiful boy. 
 [cries] 
 I got a second chance to come back here and... 
 Tell you that I'm okay. 
 Dad and I are both okay. 
 And we love you, Mom. 
 I love you. 
 I love you. 
 Oh, my sweet boy. 
 Bye. Good-bye. 
 Good-bye, Barry. 
 Mom. 
 Mom. 
 [sobbing] 
 [clock beeping] 
 I believe it's time to say good-bye to Harrison Wells. 
 It's beautiful. 
 Rip Hunter would be impressed. 
 He built the first one of these. 
 Interesting man. 
 Now what the hell is that? 
 That's my cue to leave. 
 Thank you, Cisco. 
 Don't ever come back. 
 [exciting music] 
 30 seconds. 
 Home. 
 Oh, my God. 
 Barry. 
 We have to shut down the wormhole quickly! 
 Caitlin! 
 [groaning] 
 Wells : You didn't save her. 
 Why? 
 [shouts] Why? 
 You could have had the life you wanted. 
 You could have had everything you ever wanted! 
 I already do. 
 Not for long. 
 Caitlin : Cut the internal generators. 
 Stein : Ten seconds, hurry. 
 [grunts] 
 [shouts] 
 Three, two, one. 
 Ronnie, are you okay? 
 [grunts] Did you do it? 
 Yes, I turned them all off. 
 They did it. They cut the generator. 
 [grunting] 
 Just so we're clear, after I kill you, I'm going to kill them. 
 And then I'm going to kill your father. 
 I always win, Flash. 
 [gunshot] 
 [screams] Eddie! Oh, my... 
 West : Eddie! 
 What did you do? 
 What did you do? What did you do? 
 No such thing as a coincidence. 
 What's happening? 
 Cisco, help me. 
 Eddie's his ancestor. 
 If Eddie dies, he'll never be born, and... 
 He's being erased from existence. 
 No! No! Eddie. 
 Eddie, no, no. 
 Stay with me, okay? Stay. 
 [crying] 
 He was wrong, it turns out. 
 I'm a hero after all. 
 You are, Eddie. You are my hero. 
 That's all I ever wanted to be. 
 Your hero. 
 [gasps] 
 No! 
 [Iris cries] 
 I've controlled your life for so long, Barry. 
 How will you get along without me? 
 [screams] 
 Guys, that's not good. 
 Professor, I shut down the wormhole. 
 What's happening? 
 I don't know. 
 You did close it, but it seems to be reopening. 
 We got to go. 
 You okay? 
 Iris, we have to go. 
 I'm not leaving him. 
 We have to go now, honey. I'm sorry. 
 So that's what we didn't want to happen. 
 What's it doing? 
 Feeding.
