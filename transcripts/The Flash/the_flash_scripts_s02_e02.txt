 My name is Barry Allen, and I am the fastest man alive. To the outside world, I'm an ordinary forensic scientist, but secretly, with the help of my friends at S.T.A.R. Labs, I fight crime and find other meta-humans like me. I hunted down the man who killed my mother, but in doing so, I opened up our world to new threats. And I am the only one fast enough to stop them. I am The Flash. 
 Previously on The Flash...  No! The man who saved Central City. Why did you want to kill me? He promised he'd take me home. Who? Zoom. Wells killed my mother. I don't know anything anymore, especially who I can and can't trust. S.T.A.R. Labs is now safer than ever. People can't just waltz in and out of here. Exactly. [gasps] Stay where you are. My name is Jay Garrick. Your world is in danger, Barry Allen. Please, just let me explain. I mean you no harm. How do you know my name? I know all your names. Caitlin Snow, Cisco Ramon, Detective Joe West... Enough. That part about explaining needs to happen right about now. This world is in danger. What other worlds are there? When you created the singularity above Central City, you also created a breach between my world and yours. I'm sorry, a breach? Yes, a portal connecting our two earths. And what precisely is your concern? A few days ago, you found a dead man named Al Rothstein at the nuclear plant. But then a different Al Rothstein tried to kill you. Atom Smasher. That man was from my world. If he got through the breach, I suspect there'll be more to follow. Okay, so, Jay, how exactly do you know all of this? Where I came from, I was a speedster like you. They called  me  The Flash. [stirring music] Before I arrived on your earth, I was in a fight with a man named Zoom. Zoom? I've heard that name before. Atom Smasher, he said Zoom sent him here to kill me. Who is this guy? He's a speedster, like you and me. And fast. Maybe the fastest of all. But evil. He is an unstoppable demon with the face of death. [dramatic music] We were engaged in our fiercest battle ever, racing throughout my city. But I wasn't fast enough to stop him. [screaming] Zoom had me beaten. Aah! He was about to kill me when suddenly there was a blinding light and the sky split open. A breach, between my world and yours, caused from the singularity. It pulled me in...  ♪ ♪ And I somehow ended up in your world. Powerless. Unable to return home. What do you mean? I lost my speed. How? Not entirely sure. So, you've been in Central City for six months. Why haven't you come to see us before? I'm in a foreign world here, Detective. I didn't know who you all were. Took me that long to piece it all together. So that's how you know our names. You've been following us. Look, I know how this sounds. The existence of another earth, you, another Flash, it all came as an unexpected shock to me, too. I just wish there was something I could do to convince you. There is. We're gonna... do some tests on you. See if you're telling us the truth. 'Cause if you're not, this Zoom, he's not gonna be your only enemy. [grunting] Where the hell am I? You want to go home? You only have to do one thing. What's that? Kill The Flash. [dramatic music] So, Mr. Garrick, how long have you been The Flash on your world? Not long enough to call me Mister. Please, it's Jay. Jay, of course. On my world, I've been The Flash for about two years. And how did you get your speed? Not really sure. I was at my lab trying to purify heavy water without any residual radiation when there was a blinding light. I fell into a coma. When I woke up, I could run almost as fast as the speed of light. Sorry. Did you say lab? Are you a scientist? Well, I certainly didn't work at a place like this, but, yeah. I had a respectable solo operation. Part-time chemist, part-time physicist. Part-time superhero. Hmm. I can forget that superhero part now, though, huh? Is any of this possible? A breach to another earth? It's not, right? The contrary. Just recently, the many-different-worlds theory proposed interaction with parallel universes was plausible. Now, if what Mr. Garrick's saying is true, that theory's been proven sooner than we all thought. It doesn't add up. I'm gonna be honest here, I don't understand what the hell any of you are talking about. So, Jay is saying he's from, like, a mirror-world. Or a parallel universe that's very, very similar to ours. Multiverse would be a more apt description. No, not helping. Bless your heart. Okay, let's see if this helps. This is our earth. Let's call it Earth-1. And this second Earth, let's call it Earth-2. This is where Jay claims to be from. And these other earths, three, four, five, to infinity, all of them, are nearly identical to ours. And they all exist at the same time, giving us endless alternatives to what we have here. For example, the Joe West on Earth-2, your doppelganger, he might not be a detective. He could be a Nobel Prize-winning physicist. And you, the Barry Allen here is The Flash, but over there, he could be an electrician. So, I'm assuming that the people on all these other earths work to make money to pay bills and such. I would imagine. So we got that in common. I'm heading back to the station. Call me when this makes a little bit more sense. I'm still trying to wrap my head around this whole idea of time travel. [laughs softly] There is, uh, one problem that remains. If Mr. Garrick is telling the truth, there is a breach somewhere in Central City that we need to find and close for good. Yeah, but how do we find it? We don't even know what to look for. Well, I... I suggest we put our heads together and come up with a solution. Not literally, of course. Those days are over. What'd you find? Well, Jay's heart rate is extraordinarily low. And he does have regenerative capabilities. Other than that, I'm not seeing any evidence of the Speed Force in his system. We don't even have proof that he's a speedster, much less from another earth? Not necessarily. What does that mean? Well, Jay doesn't know this, but while I was testing his heart rate, blood pressure, and motor responses, I also measured his autonomic reactions while we were talking. You gave him a lie detector test? And he passed it. What if he's not a good guy, and he just wants to find our weaknesses? Keep running tests. See what else you can find out. [phone vibrating] [phone beeps] Detective West, sir. Yes, Officer... ? Spivot. Patty Spivot. Captain Singh mentioned there may be positions available on your anti-meta-human task force. Yeah, everybody quit. There is no task force anymore. Well, I know someone who's interested in being on it. Me. You do realize that meta-humans have super powers, right? [laughs softly] And even if they didn't, you wouldn't be a good fit for the team. Because I'm a woman? I didn't mean to imply that. Good, because I know how difficult this job would be, but I think I'm an excellent candidate. I triple-majored at Hudson in biology, chemistry, and physics. I'm in prime physical condition. And I rated top of my class in marksmanship. Your class? You don't even have your stripes yet. Soon. Been on the job seven months, sir. Are you aware of what happened to my previous partner? Detective Thawne, yes. I know that he died and the one before him, Fred Chyre, died, too, but the one before that's not dead, just transferred. I'm sure it had nothing to do with you. Listen, Officer... Spivot, Patty Spivot. Yes, Spivot, the answer's no. All I'm asking for is a shot, sir. Please, just an interview. You just had the interview. Didn't get the job. [electronics beeping] I hope you understand why we have to do this. I get it, kid. You're doing what you think you have to. But you'll all realize soon enough that this, the tests, it's unnecessary. I want to help you, Barry, not harm you. You're not the first person that's said that to me. If what you told me about Zoom is true, that he sent Rothstein here to kill you, instead of locking me up in here, you better start listening. Because if Zoom is involved, you are gonna need a lot more than just me at your side to stay alive. Barry, there's a fire at the waterfront. Fire department's en route. I'm on my way. Be careful. [stirring music] ♪ ♪ [sirens blaring] [indistinct chatter] [heroic music] That was the Flash. ♪ ♪ [panting] That was a big fire. It's out, Cisco. Copy that, see you in a bit. [smacking lips] [panting] [rustling] [grunting] [suspenseful music] ♪ ♪ I thought it would be harder than this. [grunts] ♪ ♪ Barry? Hello? Are you there? What was that? I don't know. We need to find out. [camera shutter clicks] Bar. Hey. What are we dealing with here? Pfft. Well, definitely a meta-human. Had a pretty solid look at him between punches. And he was, like, made of sand. Sand? Mm-hmm. Okay. These walls are too porous to pull any prints. I can't even get one off the boat, but check this out. There's gasoline burns everywhere. Water didn't go off. Sprinklers weren't working. This was arson. Excuse me? Barry Allen? Yeah. Hi. Two days in a row, Officer. What a coincidence. Or kismet, if you believe in destiny or fate. Uh... I'm Patty. Patty Spivot. Hey. I'm really excited to meet you. I'm a huge fan. Excuse me? Your forensic reports. I... I read them sometimes. Oh. Who am I kidding? All the time. I've actually read them all. Wow, I don't think that  I've  read them all. They're always so detailed. You know, they really paint a picture like you were somehow actually there when somebody was being brutally murdered. Thank you. [playful music] Uh, anyhow, I... I found, uh, something. Well, I think I found something. It's just a theory, but I would like to show you. Great. So, this right here is the point of origin of the fire. And look. I don't know a sandblaster on the market that can make a cut that precise, so I think a meta-human may have done this. Here. Took a sample for you. Uh, there's also some fingerprints on the back of the pipe. You should have gone into CSI work. I love the science, but out here's where all the action is. Isn't that right, Detective West? Mm. The answer's still no, Officer S... Spivot, yeah. Spivot. What was that about? I'm trying to join the anti-meta-human task force. Ah. But you heard him. Hey, he's kinda like your dad, right? So, do you have any advice on how I can crack his no-code? Yeah, I've been trying to pick that lock since I was 11. So, if you figure it out, how about you let me know? Deal. All right. It was nice to meet you, Barry. Yeah, you too. Ahem. His blood pressure is low, his heart rate is low, his oxygen levels are impressive. Yeah, but nothing compared to Barry's. No, but he's certainly in the physical specimen range. In more ways than one. Hmm? Oh, I wasn't paying attention. That's enough for today, Jay. Thank you. Found it at the crime scene. I mean, it's gotta be from the meta-human that attacked me. Huh. What is this stuff? Sand? [sighs] It's not sand. It's human cells whose myosin II protein have migrated to the cell's periphery. Jay's a fellow science nerd. Those cells have the ability to rearrange and harden, giving them the appearance of sand. And how do you know this? They belong to a meta-human I've fought before named Sand Demon. I know you're new here, so I'm just gonna break it down for you. The whole "naming the bad guys thing," that's my jam. But you know what? I'm gonna let you have that one 'cause I actually kinda like it. I'm not mad at that one. Is that Barry's sweatshirt? Oh, uh, sorry. It was all we could find, so... I was gonna say, 'cause it looks a lot smaller on you, right? [Chuckles] I gotta do this thing. So, who is this Sand Demon? I don't know his name, but I know how to stop him. You know what? I think we'll be fine on our own. Look, Barry, I don't know what else I can do to prove to you I'm on your side. I've been poked, prodded. I even subjected myself to a full body scan. I was being thorough. Sand Demon's from my world. Let me teach you how to stop him. Yeah, I don't need you to teach me anything, Jay. Zoom sent Rothstein here to kill you. He must have sent Sand Demon here to do the same thing. Don't you get it? Anyone close to the Flash, all of you, are in a lot of danger. All right. If you're so good, you would have caught him already. [tense music] Let's get Jay back to his cell. ♪ ♪ Whoa. Hey, beautiful mind, I think you need to take a breather. After some, uh, lengthy calculations, I believe I have discovered the key to proving the proposed breach theory. Exotic matter. Huh. You mean, like, transdimensional energy? Precisely. Exotic matter, transdimensional energy will theoretically leak from one universe into another. Now, if this breach Mr. Garrick's talking about is real, if there is indeed a hole in our universe which leads to his earth... We can make some adjustments and upload an electrophotography program to the S.T.A.R. Labs satellite and essentially photograph the exotic matter leak. Thereby giving us the locale of said breach. Last time I saw the kit, it was in the fabrication room. I shall return. Oh, hoo, hoo. Ha-ha! Getting gooseys. All right. Let's see what you're made of. That's too much. [dark music] ♪ ♪ Barry? ♪ ♪ I thought it'd be harder than this. [heavy breathing] What's happening to me? [dark music] Hey. I found our meta. His name is Eddie Slick. We tracked those prints to his address. All right, where are you? I'll meet you there. Too late. He made me. What? Joe? [dramatic music] ♪ ♪ [grunts] [groans] ♪ ♪ So, can I be on your task force? That look familiar? How about now? [Grunts] What's it look like? A fire. There you go, genius. It's the fire you started in the third ward last night. Man, I didn't start no fire there last night. What? Were you out of town? Your cat get sick? Well, let me guess. You don't start fires anymore. You been rehabilitated. Yeah, I done it before. So what? I didn't do this one. I always start a fire with something that's hard to trace. You know, like acetone or something. Or maybe you don't need to use accelerants anymore. Iron Heights can hold people like you now. You know that, right? You think I'm one of those meta-human freaks? If I had powers, you don't think I would have used them to get away from you? December, 2013. Where were you? Why? Answer the damn question. Where were you? Blackgate Penitentiary. You don't believe me. Check your records. Jimmy, I need you to confirm something for me. So, Joe told me what you did. I'm impressed. [chuckles] No, all I did was, you know, run the other print from the electrical pipe, then track Slick down from there. That's all. [Chuckles] Yeah. [Both laugh] How's it going with Joe? You any closer to cracking his no-code? Are you kidding me? He's like the permission Sphinx. Or like a magic eight ball with just one answer. Or like, you know, the Bridgekeeper protecting the Holy Grail. What is your quest? Oh, to join your task force. No. Both : Aah! [laughter] Well, maybe I can put in a good word for you. That would mean a lot to me, Barry. He needs me. Yeah. [laughs] 
 
 Okay, so, Slick wasn't in Central City the night the particle accelerator exploded. He's lying. He's a dirt bag, and an arsonist, but he's not lying about this. He's not a meta, Barry. Slick is the guy who jumped me. Do you think it's possible that the Slick in there has a... A doppelganger? I don't know. Yesterday's surprise broadcast from a Star City vigilante who is calling himself the Green Arrow has spawned a massive outcry of both support and dissenters...  Catchy. I hate it when they put a color in their name. Yo. Yo. The sample you gave us? Yeah. Not sand. Definitely human cells. Yeah, I know. It's not him, I get it. I hate to say it, but I think this Earth-2 theory is starting to make sense. For real? What, you think Jay is lying about the Sand Demon? I don't know. That's my point. But I'm not gonna just believe some guy that walks in here and says a few things that sort of check out. Sort of? He was... he was right about Zoom. We don't even know anything about Zoom. What is Zoom? Is Zoom even real? Right now, that's just, you know, a story around a campfire. I mean, have you discovered a breach yet? Not yet, but we know how to now. Have you found one thing to suggest that Jay is a speedster? Is the Speed Force even in his system? It doesn't appear to be, no. See? We are scientists. You are a journalist. We test, we prove, we report. That's what we do. Except right now, nobody here wants to do any of that except me. [sighs] Can we have the room for a minute? [sighs] What has happened to you? Are you... me? Yes, you. The you that I grew up with. The you that is my best friend. The you that became The Flash. I haven't seen that you in a very long time. A lot's changed, Iris. Yeah, it sure has. You have learned how to not trust people. What is it about Jay that you don't like? I don't know. [Sighs] It's because he reminds you of Harrison Wells. I trusted that man. For months. We all did. [poignant music] And you know what? Eddie is dead. Ronnie is dead. And a whole lot of other people in this city, they are dead because we trusted him. I'm not gonna let us make that mistake again. Barry, not everyone is Harrison Wells. Besides, you defeated him because you trusted in people. Because you believed in them. This team that you have here, they will follow your lead. They'll do what you say. But if they think that you don't believe in them, it won't be long before they don't believe in you. ♪ ♪ Get to walking. I don't want to see your ugly mug around here again. Sayonara. We didn't have probable cause. I get it. One thing you should know about dealing with these meta-humans, nothing is ever as it seems. Speaking of which, you're the only person here who wants to be on my task force. You want to tell me why you're so hell-bent on being on it? You want to tell me why you're so hell-bent I'm not? Didn't I just tell you I didn't want to see your ugly mug around here again? Well, you're gonna have to, Detective West. So I can get to the Flash. [dramatic music] [grunts] ♪ ♪ [grunts] Hey! [gunfire] ♪ ♪ I like you. You'll do the trick... just fine. Finally come to your senses? Sand Demon kidnapped a police officer. A woman that I know. And you need my help? I need you to help us save her. Before something happens. I guess you're gonna have to trust me now, huh, kid? [laughs softly] We're looking for any structures  that promote humidity. Greenhouses, grow rooms, anything of the sort. His body will literally start to fall apart if he becomes dehydrated. Like dry sand. Exactly. Sand Demon always attacks on two fronts. He creates a diversion, then strikes when you're distracted. Okay, then what do we do? We use your speed to get to him before the distraction can happen. Jay, how do I stop somebody who can slip through my fingers? The way I was never able to. With lightning. Yo, are you about to pull a Zeus right now? What are you talking about? Barry's gonna hurl lightning from the energy he creates when he runs. Because lightning plus sand equals... Glass. Time to learn something new, kid. [laughs softly] All right. Choo! [chuckles] Give me a sec. Hey, are you good? That was Singh. CCPD still hasn't found anything yet. Irony is, I didn't want Patty to have anything to do with the damn task force in the first place. And she gets taken because of me. No, no, no, this isn't your fault, all right? It's hard not to think that. Well, look, we're gonna find Patty, all right? Whatever it takes. [sighs] [water dripping] [dark music] ♪ ♪ Flash is coming for you, you know? Yes, I'm sure he is. You can't beat him. I don't care what powers you have. I wouldn't be too sure about that. Is that why you need to build that concussive bomb? Yeah, I know what it is. I'm a cop. I've seen one before. This isn't gonna kill the Flash. I am. This... is gonna kill you. ♪ ♪ You know you got lucky, right? You think you were chosen. The rest of us don't mean anything. But it's not true. You were just at the right place at the right time.

Either way, you and the Flash are about to find out what those worst parts are. ♪ ♪ [beeping] I've searched all the vacant buildings in Central City and none of them fit the description that we need.

[panting] I've been doing this for an hour. It's not working. It's because you're trying to rush it. This is the one time you need to slow down. Let the energy pass over you, then simply direct it to where you want it to go. All right, Jay... I don't know if I'm gonna get this in time. You'll get it. I believe in you. The last person that helped me like this was a man that I looked up to. Idolized. He taught me how to get faster, how to get stronger, how to use my powers to save people. That same man murdered my mother. [tense music] It's a tough break, but I'm not him. Yeah. I know where they are! [panting] The abandoned Woodrue grow house. That's where Slick's keeping Patty. Dude, great job. And I was thinking, if I were Sand Demon and I were attacking a speedster on two fronts, I would probably want to slow you down, like, by using a concussive bomb or something like that. That's a good thought. He's actually used one on me before. His body absorbs the blast so it doesn't affect him. Well, kid, gonna have to think of something. You know what? What if we give Slick a diversion? He knows you, right? You said you went up against him. Yeah, but, Barry, I don't have my speed. He doesn't know that. You got your suit? Sure.

I just stood there and took a few punches. It was more than a few. This is a lot harder than I thought. Losing something that was such a big part of who I was for so long. I lost something that was a part of me, too. It's hard, but it gets easier every day. [sentimental music] You just have to find a new way to live.

What is it with alliteration and nicknames? [laughs softly] Hey, look, Jay, um... So, thank you for all your help. And for being so patient with me. Nah, anytime, kid. You're a quick study. Took me a lot longer to learn how to toss lightning, believe me. Then I suppose I had the right teacher. It's going to be a lot harder to take down Zoom. Who is this guy? No one knows. He showed up around the same time as when I got my powers. Killed a lot of people in my world. I spent about two years tracking him down. But he was too smart, too quick. He's always one step ahead. You really think he's just bringing these guys here to kill me? Zoom is obsessed with destroying me. Now he wants to destroy you. Yeah. He needs to be the best.

Well, I always check the jacket of anyone I'm considering for it. In my research on you, I found out we got a mutual acquaintance. Mark Mardon. I need you to be honest with me here. Why do you want to do this? Mark Mardon killed my dad. [dark music] He had a little shoe shop down on Chesterfield. It was a cash business. One night he went to Fairfield bank to make his weekly deposit, and the Mardon brothers showed up. While he was waiting in line, Mark shot my dad in the face for a few hundred dollars. ♪ ♪ Then a few months later, Mark and his brother got powers. Two murderers got superpowers.

[dark music] Something's happening to me. I'm starting to perceive things. Horrible things. It started after Wells killed me in the other timeline.

It appears that while we were indeed successful in closing the singularity, there was an unfortunate side effect. What are you talking about? Using electrophotography, Cisco and I were able to search Central City for any signs of energy entering our earth from another dimension. From any "breaches", as Mr. Garrick described them. But, of course, there isn't just one breach. There's 52 of them scattered throughout the city. These breaches are pockets of time and space folded into and upon itself. But the most significant breach of all appears to be this one. [computer beeping] And where exactly is that located? It's here, inside S.T.A.R. Labs.
