 Before there was s*x, before there was the city, there was just me... Carrie. Carrie Bradshaw. It's 1984. Ronald Reagan and shoulder pads were all the rage. I'm trying to figure out who I am with the help of my family, my best friends, a sexy new guy... 
 Hey, Bradshaw. 
 Hey. 
 And a hot new city. 
 What about an internship? 
 Manhattan? 
 Manhattan? No way. 
 You work at "Interview" magazine? 
 Larissa Loughlin, style editor. 
 Carrie Bradshaw, mortified. 
 Figuring out who I was and finding my voice 
 wasn't going to be easy, 
 but I was pretty sure it was going to be a lot of fun. 
 ♪ Hey! 
 They say that the eyes are the window to the soul, 
 that looking into someone's eyes 
 is to know the truth, to know what's real. 
 ♪ And she was lying in the grass ♪ 
 The same could be said for the city that never sleeps. 
 ♪ Breathing  It's honest and totally awesome. 
 You and your bag are fabulous. 
 You think I'd plan a photo shoot around anything less than perfection? 
 So it's really gonna happen? 
 My purse in "Interview" magazine? 
 In two weeks' time, two emaciated models will cling to that bag like their lives depend on it. 
 Maybe I was lying to myself, 
 but I felt like nothing could stop me. 
 Or us. 
 ♪ She was floating above it ♪ And she was  Except maybe Donna Ladonna and her minions. 
 ♪ And she was  And me being grounded. 
 Think we're ever gonna have one minute alone, Bradshaw? 
 We did have one minute. 
 We did? 
 Yeah. Don't you remember? 
 We were at your locker, and you said, "what time is it?" 
 And I said, "2:05." 
 And then Donna showed up. 
 I've seen more of Donna in the last two weeks than I have in the last decade. 
 We were alone for exactly 65 seconds. 
 I timed it. 
 ♪ Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey ♪ 
 Just imagine what would've happened if we had another 19 seconds. 
 I can't even... uhh! 
 Whoa! 
 Sorry. 
 It's okay. 
 Sebastian. 
 Hey, guys. 
 We were just going. 
 ♪ Right there with it, and she was ♪

 And surprisingly fun for me and Dorrit. 
 I'm gonna kill you! 
 Only if you can catch me! 
 No! 
 Bull's-eye! 
 Now you're going to get it! 
 What's going on out here? 
 Uh... We're just washing the car. 
 Really? 
 When I heard the screaming, I just assumed you were killing each other. 
 Nope. 
 Hard to believe, I know. 
 I'm proud of you. 
 You girls have been taking your punishment like real pros. 
 Yeah, I always wanted to be a professional groundee. 
 Wait. I can do that as a full-time job? 
 Yeah, okay, laugh it up. Laugh all you want. 
 But dare I say that grounding you may have actually been a good thing? 
 No. Unh-unh. 
 No way! 
 You want in on this? 
 No, you don't. No, you don't! 
 My dad was right. 
 Our confinement had brought us closer. 
 We hadn't gotten along this well 
 since before our mom had died. 
 And maybe we were lying to ourselves, 
 but we felt it would last forever. 
 ♪ On the floors of Tokyo Yellow? 
 Save me from a dinner at the country club with my dad and his gold-digging girlfriend. 
 Don't knock it. 
 The baked Alaska there is very good. 
 Wait. Do you belong to the club? 
 Nah. We Bradshaws aren't really joiners. 
 I knew I liked you for all the right reasons. 
 So you'll be my escape? 
 Mm, you know I can't. 
 I'm grounded. 
 Have you ever heard of sneaking out? 
 I have, but I would never. 
 What, too good girl for that? 
 Too terrified to get caught. 
 That's never my issue. 
 That doesn't surprise me. 
 Well, don't get into too much trouble without me. 
 I'll try, but I can't promise, Bradshaw. 
 That is a joke, right? 
 Yeah, somehow trouble always seems to find me. 
 And he was right, 
 and its name was "Donna." 
 Mr. and Mrs. Ladonna. 
 And Ms. Donna. 
 May I show you to your table? 
 Go and sit down. I'll be right there. 
 Meanwhile, "The Love Boat" 
 was playing across town... Except someone wasn't coming aboard. Mags. Stop. What if I don't want to? Seriously, no. Don't you want me to? Your parents are right in the den. Well, they can't hear anything. Besides, we can be very, very... Quiet. Just... stop. Okay? ♪ Love Okay, I don't understand. We've been together two years. Why don't you wanna have s*x with me? Are... are you not... attracted to me? Of course I'm into you. You're gorgeous. ♪ Soon we'll making another run ♪ So... let's do it. You don't want your... Our first time to be like this, with your parents right downstairs watching "The Love Boat." You deserve better. I guess you're right. Of course I am. Our first time should be... Special. Who knew a little itty bitty piece of fabric could cause such controversy? I don't know if it because the one I was wearing was gold or if it was the tassels? I never quite got to the bottom of it. Oh, or maybe it was because of the  size  of the bottom. ♪ well, you made me recall... You don't like bikinis? I like 'em just fine. I just don't think much of country clubs. We joined while he was away at school. Has an attitude about it. He has an attitude about everything. Well, maybe you just haven't seen the place through the right person's eyes. I could give you a tour. Go on. Certainly don't need to hang out with your old man. ♪ Yesterday Hello? We need to talk. What's happening? What's wrong? I just saw Sebastian and Donna... Together. Where?! Nobody comes out here at night. We could do anything and not get caught. You make everything sound like a come-on. Everything is. I can go find them, figure out what they're doing. I don't want you to spy on Sebastian. I trust him. Well, do you trust Donna? You know she's gonna be all flirty and pouty and talking about sexy things. You know, I lost my virginity on this very bench. Have I shocked you? Were you hoping to? It would be fun to get  some  kind of reaction out of you. If Sebastian is stupid enough to fall for that, then he isn't worth it. And by "that," do you mean the big lips or the big boobs? He's a guy, Carrie. Guys always fall for that. So funny. I shouldn't have said anything. I'm sure nothing happened. Just ask him about it at school on monday. And if he has nothing to hide, then he'll be honest. I will. I'll ask him. In two weeks, my purse will be in "Interview" magazine. You're gonna be famous. Well, my bag will be. You still wanna hang with me when your bag's so important? Mm, I'll try to find time for you. My bag may have a lot going on. You know, parties, clubs, openings to attend. While I'll be stuck here, hanging at the country club. Did you have fun? Bump into anyone interesting? Nah. Uneventful. I knew it wasn't the whole truth. The question was, would he step up and be honest? Sebastian. Turns out someone else was planning on stepping up and butting in. Did you have a good weekend, Carrie? Yeah. Thanks for asking. You? You know, I can always make my own fun. Mm. Oh. I forgot to give you this back. Thanks for keeping me warm. I'm sorry. For lying or that you got caught? Both. Finally the truth. Can I... Yeah. Donna was at the country club with her parents. I was there with my dad. We hung out, but nothing happened. It's because of Carrie? Apparently, enough happened that she's all snuggled up in your clothes. I mean, it was cold out. Were you playing night golf? We might have been smoking some pot. Okay. I didn't want you to know that. Why? You're not that kind of girl. One who likes to have a good time? No wonder you'd rather hang out with Donna. I'd rather hang with  you. But I'm grounded. I'm not fun. I'm not gonna lie and say I don't like to party. I do. Maybe even need to sometimes. I get it. You want to escape. But not when I'm with you. Wow. You're good. I try to be. I should've just told you. Yes, you should've. It won't happen again. I believe you. So we're okay? I wasn't sure if it was a lie, but I wanted it to be true. Yeah. We're good. I feel like being grounded is destroying my chances with Sebastian. It's only one more week. That's nothing. Hello? This is High School. Time here is like dog years in reverse. Wait. So does that mean a week is less time than a week or more? It means time moves fast and things change... quick. So I think you mean - it's just like dog years, period. Yeah, I think mouse is right because dog years happen faster than human years. Okay, whatever, people. Let's do get bogged down with the details. So the point is, anything can happen in a week. And right now you and Sebastian are basically just friends that flirt. You need to take it to the next level, pronto. I disagree. If he's worth it, he'll wait. But of course he won't because guys are jerks. I know you're still upset about Seth, and you should be, but... But you shouldn't take it out on all guys 'cause not all of us are jerks. It's true. Some of them won't have s*x with you and dump you. They just won't have s*x with you at all. Maybe we should get back to Carrie and Sebastian. Mm! And Donna, because let's face it, she's not gonna wait. I'm sorry, but Sebastian isn't some kind of trophy that goes to the first person to cross the finish line. Tell that to Donna. She thinks he's the ultimate prize, and that girl will stop at nothing. So what do I do? I'm grounded. Your dad's still letting you swim, right? Yeah, but, I mean... But nothing. Invite him to the swim club. And lie to my dad again? Mm-hmm. I think what your dad doesn't know won't hurt him. But I'm not for lying. You cannot let that fake baking, big-boobed bitch win. That, too. Ow! You've gotta start looking out for you, Carrie. Nobody else is gonna do it. Is something going on with you and Walt? What do you mean? Well... I don't want to butt in where I don't belong, but it seems pretty clear you and Walt haven't had s*x. But you told us you... Yeah, well, I lied, okay? We haven't. So why would you say you had? I don't know. I got embarrassed. Mouse was talking about her and Seth, and... I've been dating Walt for two years, and we haven't, and... It's not because I don't want to. Don't you think that's weird? I knew the kindest thing was to lie. Well, maybe he's just waiting for the perfect time. Maybe you're right. Timing is everything. And you should keep that in mind with Sebastian. I mean, between being grounded and your sister and your internship at that law firm, you don't seem like you have time for him. Make it, or you'll regret it. You better get moving. Your bus is gonna be outside any minute. Going. Oh, uh, did you want me to sign that, uh, permission slip for your video class? Actually, I'm meeting Carrie at the pool instead. If you still want to? Of course. Tomorrow afternoon, you and me. Cool. Bye! Bye. Okay. Ready to head into the city? Yeah, I guess. Is everything okay? You don't seem as excited about heading into New York as you usually do. Mm, it's just... There's a lot going on at school, and I don't want to miss stuff. Is this internship getting in the way of your schoolwork? No. No, I can handle it. Because if... if you're having problems, you need to talk to your teachers. Okay, just be honest with them. And the way to do that is with complete openness and total honesty. Hello? Tom Bradshaw is not here. Ugh. Telemarketers. Yes. Lying gets you nowhere. Well, today it's getting you to work on time. ♪ We got the beat  and as mush as I worried about leaving Sebastian behind, right in front of me was the city. ♪ we got it! ♪ we got the beat I'm stuck here all day. I thought you wanted to go to century 21 to buy an outfit for your date? Well, with the amount of work I have, not a chance. Once again, I will be wearing this on a date. No wonder I can't get laid. Uh... You wanted to see me? I'm gonna need you to switch gears. All of these documents need to be collated and then bound in binders. There should be 60 of them. And I need it by end of business today. Okay. Some woman with a hoity-toity accent called here for you yesterday like three times. Larissa Loughlin? What did she say? "Is Carrie Bradshaw there?" And what did you say? "No". Well, did you tell here why I wasn't here? Because I was at school? Yes, I decided to spend my very busy day talking to a complete stranger about my High School intern. I see your point. No personal calls. Yes. Thanks for the reminder. Be useful or be gone. Larissa, it's Carrie... Bradshaw. Darling, thank God! I need you to get down here right now. Where is here? And why? D.U.M.B.O. As in the elephant? As in Brooklyn. I need your bag for the photo shoot. I thought the shoot was in two weeks. Well, now it's today. We were supposed to be shooting that darling corey. Feldman or haim? Is there a difference? Well, Haim is the one with the soulful eyes, and feldman... Well, whichever one it was, he's so bloody hungover, we can't get him out of bed. He's 13. I don't care how old he is. I cannot photograph someone who's the color of pea soup. So... change of plans. Enter the purse. My whole shoot revolves around it. I don't think I can get down there today. Oh, darling, that's so disappointing. I need to go. I have much work to do. Maybe we could do the shoot another day? Don't be silly. Ta-ta. Don't have a lot of time. Just wait. I knew in that moment if I let Larissa go, her glamorous Manhattan would disappear from my life. And truth be told, I couldn't bear that. Of course. I can make it. Oh, you are brilliant. I'm mad for you! Meet me at the pier, and, uh, now isn't soon enough. They say honesty is the best policy, but honesty wasn't going to get my purse into "Interview" magazine. As I tried to come up with my escape plan... Hello? Hey, Carrie. It's me. I'm sorry. Who? Uh, uh, Sebastian. Sebastian Kydd. Oh! Hey. Sorry. Uh, bad connection. Is it cool I'm calling? I got your work number from mouse. Yeah. No problem at all. Um, is everything okay? Yeah. Well, the thing is, there's this concert this weekend, and I was thinking, if you're not gonna be grounded anymore... I won't be grounded. Cool. 
 
 So it's Blue Oysteyscult. Do you like 'em? I wasn't sure if he was talking about a band or a food. Love. Love. All right. Well, awesome. So they... so they have two sets... And suddenly, my two worlds were colliding, and it wasn't gonna be pretty. Okay, sounds great. Bye. What is it about no personal phone calls that you don't get? Um... Actually, I was just going through some of the files, and, um, I realized that we only have enough to make 56 binders, and you said we need 60, so I called the printer to see if we could get more. Crap. I guess I have to head over there. Or I could do it for you. I know you're busy today. Fine. And also stop by storage and grab the files for the Constantine case. But remember, if you don't finish this by tonight, I'm not signing the sheet for your school credit, so hustle back. Of course. Wait. And in that moment, I knew my escape was doomed. And pick me up lunch from the Chinese place on the corner. The chicken one. Moo goo gai pan? Okay. Hi, stranger. Mags. Mm. Mnh. Come on, we're at school. Anybody could walk by. I know. That's what makes it so sexy. Stop. I just wanna feel close to you. Well, you couldn't be any closer than you are right now. You're kinda smothering me. I'm just trying to get something started. It's not like  you  ever do. Kind of all alone in this. Well, maybe you shouldn't try so hard. It makes you seem desperate. And while Walt and Maggie were moving farther apart, I was getting closer to my dream. ♪ see them walking hand in hand across... ♪ My purse and I were making the ultimate entrance. ♪ heads turning as the lights flashing out are so bright ♪ 
♪ Then walk right out to the fourline track ♪ 
♪ There's a camera rolling on her hack ♪ Darling, you've arrived! I'll say. Oh! Today has been absolute chaos. Maybe these earrings. You say that like it's a good thing. Honey, I don't just thrive in chaos. I love it. The moment where all is lost is the moment I wanna live in, because  that  is where creativity lives. It inspires. I wondered if that was true or just the lie we tell ourselves. Perfect. Now give me that bag. It deserves its moment. ♪ Girls on film ♪ on film ♪ girls on film ♪ two minutes later ♪ girls on film ♪ on film  I couldn't believe it. One night, I wrote my name on my mother's bag in attempt to salvage it, and now here I was, holding a zebra and watching my purse be photographed for "Interview" magazine. Thank you. This is a dream come true. And to think, you almost missed all this because of some boring work thing. Oh, no. Work. I have to go. I have to get back. Here, uh, take this zebra. Wait. You're such a mystery, always dashing off. So exciting. How will I get your purse back? Uh, I'll call you. Okay. Bye. Mwah! Oh, Carrie, wait! ♪ Big hands, I know you're the one ♪ I want you to have this. It's Dior. It's one-of-a-kind. I can't take that. Oh, of course you can. You deserve it. You're one-of-a-kind. You don't believe it, but one day you will. How will I ever believe that? You know the fairy tale Pinocchio? Yeah. Well, that little puppet was a pretend boy who became real because he believed it. Actually, Pinocchio could only become real if he told the truth, and he couldn't. Okay, well... Then not that story. The point is, sometimes you have to fake it to make it. After a while, what's fake becomes truth. The only thing that would be true if I didn't get back and fast was how much trouble I was going to be in... ♪ let me go on  and I knew time was running out for me. ♪ let me go on ♪ big hands, I know you're the one ♪ Somehow, I had done it. Maybe Larissa was right. From chaos, even the impossible can become possible, and I had made it happen. Except... I hadn't. You're an hour and a half late. I... Can explain? Maybe  I  should explain. I'm the person who signs that little sheet that gets you credit for this internship. But... But you think you're young and cute, and because your dad is friends with Harlan silver, one of the partners here, you're not accountable. No. I know I am. These are the binders that are already done. Well, 50 of them. I still have the last ten to do this afternoon. When the printer realized their mistake, they offered to collate them free of charge. Uh, and here's the Constantine case. Oh, cases. There were two different Constantines, so I brought them both just to be safe. It was gonna take more than just fake confidence to get me through this. And, um... Here. What is that? It's a scarf. I know you have something special tonight, so I thought you might like this. I couldn't take that. I bought it for you. How much do I owe you? I got it in the bargain bin. You can buy me a bagel or something one morning. Oh, and I, uh, left your Chinese food on your desk. And I got you extra pancakes. Well, thank you. Now get back to work. Those binders aren't gonna bind themselves. And if you screw up again or disobey me, this internship's over. The scarf was gone, but at least for now my life here in Manhattan as safe. I figured a little lie about a one-of-a-kind scarf was worth it. Meanwhile, the mouse was wondering just what to tell me about what she was seeing. Oh! Mouse! Mouse, come here. Hey. Hey. You look  so  cute today. Doesn't she? So cute. Sure. Yeah. Sure. Thanks. Well, I'm glad you showed up. I actually have to head off to a massage, so... Sebastian here has just been talking my ear off. That's me. The chatty type. You're so funny. Well, I will see you guys later. Don't miss me too much. It sucks you're not coming to the video class tomorrow. It's gonna be so rad. We're making a music video. I can't. I promised Carrie I'd hang with her at the pool. I thought you hated her. She's not so bad. I kinda feel sorry for her. It feels like she needs me, so I don't wanna disappoint her. The only time my sister even acknowledges me is when she knows I took a message for her from one of her lame boyfriends. It's cool you and Carrie like to hang out. Yeah. Whatever. No big deal. This is from the photo shoot. Larissa gave it to me. You might be the coolest person I know. Stop. As we both know, I am a... Loser. Mnh-mnh. That's not what Larissa thinks. It's weird. After Larissa told me to fake it, I had to go back to my office and pretend I wasn't terrified of bitchy Barbara. You know what? It worked. It saved me from being fired. Hmm. Maybe it is that simple, just believing it. Yeah. I should tell myself I'm ready... with Maggie. Are you? I don't know what I'm waiting for. And it's important to her. I'm gonna surprise her tomorrow after school. I guess. But, Walt... Mouse. What are you doing here? I guess all your friends really wanted to make sure you got your homework. Okay, you guys can only stay here for a little while longer. All right? Carrie is still grounded, after all. Leaving in five. I change my vote on Sebastian. What are you talking about? Go for it. You cannot let that two-faced, big-lipped bitch get him. She's kind of an evil genius. I completely underestimated her. She called me cute and said that she was happy to see me in front of Sebastian. She actually seemed nice. Donna. Nice. Okay, that is terrifying. You better move, and fast. You wanna meet at the swim club today? I thought you were grounded? That's for me to worry about. So do you wanna meet or not? Of course. Meet there at 4:30? Make it 4:00 and I'm yours. I like the sound of that. Good. Don't be late. Today was the day... I would  completely  disappoint Dorrit. Dorrit. Why do you seem surprised to see me? So you're not mad? Of course not. I get it. Okay, so I'll see you at home. You're okay walking? Sure. No problem. We can hang when I get back. I told myself that Dorrit was fine. I wasn't sure if I believed it, but I didn't have time to dwell on it. And while I hurried to get ready... Walt waited... For Maggie. Unfortunately, Maggie hadn't waited for Walt. Oh, thank God it's you. Oh, I don't know who else it'd be. Well, see, my dad's the chief of police, so he has this car with, like, the lights and the siren thingy. You're such a smart-ass. Isn't that what you like about me? Come on. Get in. Thought you'd never ask. While Maggie was all bravado, I tried to fake I wasn't nervous but was doing a lousy job. I love how aggressive you are. I am not. Shut up. That time at your parents' barbecue... I never thought of you as anything more than a kid. You showed me. Oh. Well, I hate to break up the party, but we should probably get going. Hey, can you, um... Can you just lie with me? It's getting kinda late. Just for a minute or two. You just can't get enough, can you? It was getting harder and harder for Maggie to lie to herself that this was real intimacy. Hey, kiddo. Hey. You're home from the pool early. Everything okay? So you didn't think I'd be on time? I never said that. I was just impressed that you are. I hate people who are late. My mom's always late. You'd think after 18 years of being screamed at by my dad, she could have figured out how to be on time. Yeah, but we ladies have a lot more to do than you to get ready, you know? We've gotta pick an outfit and do our makeup and hair. You don't need any of that. Don't lie. I'm not lying. I want you to kiss me. So kiss me. Carrie? It looked like my lies were catching up to me. Let's go, Carrie. Mr. Bradshaw? I want to apologize. For corrupting my daughter? I asked him there. It was my idea. But I said yes. I-I apologize, sir. I'm Sebastian, Mr. Bradshaw. That's a nice handshake. Thank you, sir. My grandfather taught me the handshake makes the man. Yeah, mine, too. What did you say your name was? Sebastian. Sebastian Kydd. Garret's son? You know my dad? I do. Yeah. Now if, uh, you'll excuse us, Sebastian, we have to get going. So I can be punished for the rest of my life. Walt. What are you doing here? Waiting for you. For how long? The last four hours. You waited here all that time? I came here because I thought I was ready. That tonight was it. But... The longer I waited and wondered where you were... I wasn't with anyone, I swear. It doesn't matter. That's weird, right? That I wouldn't care. I don't know. Maybe you're not the jealous type. I wanted to believe that I was in love with you in the way that it matters. But the longer I stood here, I realized I wasn't. What are you saying? I think we should break up. Um, d-did I do something? Because I can change. We can make it work. It's not you. You're perfect. Then why don't you love me? Mags, I do. Just... Not in that way. But I'll always be here for you. Always. I'm sorry. And for the first time, Walt wasn't lying. It was hard, but at least it was the truth. Morning, daddy. I made you breakfast. Strawberry with frosting. Your favorite. And your coffee. Yeah, buttering me up isn't gonna change what happened last night. Will I be able to leave the house before college? Your punishment is done today. I said two weeks, and it's been two weeks. Is this a trick? I'm not gonna lie to you. I never would've expected this kind of behavior from you. I'm sorry. Just... Please know you  can  trust me. Can I? You lied to me. And I shouldn't have. I know that. Does it help that I feel awful? If Dorrit hadn't told me, I never would've even known that you disobeyed me. I can't be with you all the time, but I have to trust that you're gonna make the right choices, even when I'm not there. I need you to... Prove to me that you're the daughter that I think you are. I will. I promise. Good. Because if you don't, there will be consequences. I know. Like no more internship. Okay. I got it. No more screwups. Good. So... you're okay if I go out tonight? Yeah, but not with that Sebastian. What? Wait, are you telling me I can't date? Because we're gonna have a serious problem. No, I'm telling you that you can't date  him. I... know a little bit about him and his family, and, uh, I'm telling you to stay away. Why? Because I said so. You expect me not to see the cutest guy at school, and your reason is "because I said so"? Yeah. Pinocchio was a puppet that wanted to be a real boy. All he had to do was be truthful, and his wish would come true. And even then, he couldn't help but lie. Doing the right thing is hard. Maybe because lying is often easier than the truth. And sometimes it actually gets you what you want. But at some point, like Pinocchio's nose, the lies just keep growing until it's hard to tell what's real and what's not. And we can either live in that world of make-believe or face the truth and everything that comes with it. Hey. I know you're mad. I'm not mad. Not at you. At myself... For blowing you off. That wasn't cool. No, it wasn't. I'm sorry. I was hoping to make it up to you. You wanna hang out? We can make a night of it? I think, uh, mouse is coming over. Maybe watch "The Wall" or something? Are we gonna be stoned? No. Then I don't get it. What's the point? I bought a bootlegged copy of "Purple Rain." How'd you get that? I think it's better if you don't know. Huh. You're something, Dorrit. I know. That's probably mouse now. Hey. Hey. So that was weird yesterday. Yeah. My dad's really overprotective. You grounded for life? Uh, surprisingly, no. So you can hang out tonight? We can go to the concert. Actually, I can't. Oh. It's not that I don't want to. I do. A lot. Uh... it's just, things have been tense in my house. Yeah, it's fine, Bradshaw. You can't be that mad at me since you called me "Bradshaw." Does it bother you? No. I like it. Okay then, Bradshaw. I'll see you on monday. Okay, Kydd. I'll see you then. All along, I thought I was juggling my new guy and my new city. In reality, it was a lot more complicated. I would need to choose between Sebastian and my dad. Who was that?
