 It's always the same dream. 
 [ Modern English's "I Melt With You" playing ] 
 I'm in the city... 
 And I belong. 
 Manhattan is mine. 
 Hey, watch it! 
 But then I always wake up the same old Carrie Bradshaw... 
 In Castlebury, Connecticut. 
 ♪ Using all my breath They say to key to being a writer is figuring out who you are, finding your voice. 
 Aah! 
 Well, that seemed to be the only thing I had found that day. 
 Where is it? Please, please. 
 Dorrit! 
 Where's the purse? 
 What purse? Give me a break, Dorrit. 
 You know exactly which purse I'm talking about. Mom's purse. 
 ♪ I'll stop the world and melt with you ♪ 
 You can't go through my stuff. Don't. 
 You have pot? 
 Your friends smoke pot. 
 You're 14. So? 
 So if dad finds out, he's going to kill you. 
 So you better not tell him. Well, it'd serve you right if I did. 
 You're such a tattletale. 
 I'm sorry I have a life, and you don't. 
 Oh, is that way you're always spying on me, listening to my phone conversations? 
 Do not! Do too! 
 [ Talking Heads' "Burning Down The House" playing ] 
 ♪ Watch out The year? 1984. 
 Romance novels were all the rage. 
 We had an actor for president, and most people could say they were better off now than they were four years ago... 
 Except us. 
 Four years ago, we had our mom, and three months ago, we lost her to cancer. 
 Things were definitely not better. 
 Give me back my purse, Dorrit! 
 Aah! Ow! 
 God, what the hell is going on in here?! 
 She bit me! She's going through my stuff! 
 We do not have time for this. 
 You both have to be in school in half an hour, all right? 
 Carrie, go on and get dressed. 
 I know you took it. Go. 
 You can't be late on your first day. And, Dorrit... 
 That is... way too much eye makeup. 
 ♪ Time for jumping overboard Carrie... 
 You're the older one. You can't take the bait. 
 I have teeth marks on my arm. 
 I know that Dorrit can be difficult. 
 But... your mom would want you two to get along. 
 Yeah. Yeah, I know. 
 All right? So whatever you two were fighting about, it's not worth it. 
 She stole mom's purse. 
 You don't know that. 
 I can't go to school without the purse, dad. 
 You're going to school. I don't have anything to wear. 
 Come on. 
 You've got a whole floor full of clothing. No. 
 Mom used to take me shopping for an outfit. 
 It was--was a thing we did, you know? 
 Back-to-school clothes? 
 Okay. 
 Did you want me to take you? 
 No. No, that was, um... 
 Supposed to be mom. 
 I see. 
 I just... I need the purse. 
 I-I need a piece of her. 
 I have an idea. 
 My mother left us on Memorial Day, and that's what this closet felt like-- 
 a memorial, a still life of our life without her, as if leaving it untouched might somehow bring her back. 
 We had been forbidden to enter... 
 Until now. 
 Uh, not that dress. 
 She wore it on her last birthday. 
 You could spill something on it or rip it, you know? 
 Uh... 
 Really? 
 Yeah. Just... try not to let 'em get broken in your backpack. 
 I'll be super careful, I promise. 
 The first day of school was something I usually found exciting, but so much had changed for me. 
 Hi! How was your summer? 
 As I watched everyone passing around the news of the day like mono after a homecoming dance, I realized that I was the virus no one wanted to get near-- 
 the freak who had lost her mom... 
 Except for Donna Ladonna and her minions, the Jens. 
 Donna was just twisted enough to think a connection to tragedy would make her that much more compelling, and she wouldn't be wrong. 
 Carrie, you poor girl. Are you doing okay? 
 Yeah, I'm fine. 
 Okay, well, if you need anything-- 
 I mean, a shoulder to cry on, fashion tips, maybe even a wand of mascara, I'm here for you. 
 I'll keep that in mind. Thanks. 
 You're such a good person. 
 Thanks. 
 And then there were my people-- 
 my best friends who loved me no matter what. 
 Bradshaw. 
 Mouse. 
 Oh! 
 I heart you, you know? I know. 
 I need it. 
 Boob to boob, baby. Hi, Maggie. 
 Hey. 
 Walt, nice sweater. Is that the one from... 
 The one Rob Lowe was wearing in "Interview"? 
 Nice. How you holding up? 
 Mm. I'd be a lot better if I didn't feel like everyone was staring at me. 
 Oh, please. No one is even looking at you. 
 Believe it or not, I think Mags actually meant that as a compliment. 
 Mm-hmm. 
 There is way bigger news today. 
 I have to agree. New kid. New guy. 
 A junior like us. 
 Ah, does new kid have a name? 
 Even his name is cool. 
 Sebastian Kydd. 
 ♪ Told me who you are ♪ tell me how do I feel There he was--the new kid, Sebastian Kydd. 
 ♪ Those who came before me He's been kicked out of three boarding schools-- 
 Deerfield, Exeter, and I forget where else. 
 ♪ From the past His parents finally had to give up and bring him home. 
 ♪ They will turn away no more They're totally rich. He drives a Porsche. 
 Mags, you do realize I'm standing right here, and I'm your boyfriend? 
 Hey, Bradshaw. 
 Hey. 
 Heard about your mom. 
 Real bummer. 
 Thanks. 
 I'll see you around. 
 I can't get kicked out of another school this early in the year. 
 So you have some explaining to do. 
 Why did you hide this from us? We need to know everything. 
 I'm not hiding anything, I swear. 
 Last summer, he hung out at the swim club. 
 Why don't I swim? 
 Because your hair would get wet and your makeup would run. 
 Hey, where's Walt? 
 I told him I wanted it to be just us girls. 
 Were you two fighting again? 
 Come on. You guys are never gonna break up. 
 You're forever. 
 That's right, and the mouse and I 
 would be a couple forever, too. 
 Why do you have that look on your face? 
 Mouse, did you meet someone? 
 Are you breaking up with me? 
 At the Page Program in D.C. 
 I've been dying to tell you guys. 
 So start talking. 
 Seth. Seth Glassman. 
 He's from Washington, started Princeton. 
 He's a freshman. 
 I should date an older guy. 
 He's amazing. So smart. I mean, we'd stay up in the dorm rooms and we'd just talk about everything. 
 And I'd wake up in his arms and just think... 
 That you got laid. 
 Just because all you think about is losing your virginity doesn't mean the mouse does. 
 Wait. You lost your virginity to Seth? 
 It was like putting a hot dog in a keyhole. 
 Ow! 
 It hurt so bad. 
 And I just kept thinking, like, when is this going to end? 
 And luckily it did, because it was over in two seconds. 
 It wasn't like that for me at all. 
 Wait. You and Walt had s*x? 
 Uh, I wasn't supposed to say anything. 
 Walt won't be mad. 
 No, he will. 
 Just... swear you won't say anything. 
 I won't. I swear. 
 So... I'm the last virgin? 
 It's no big deal, Carrie. I mean, s*x isn't everything. 
 So... you don't feel like it changed you? 
 It's weird. 
 Like, I feel more confident, like I know stuff, but scared 'cause there's something to lose. 
 Are you in love with him? 
 We should go on a double date. Is he coming up to visit? 
 Yeah, I mean... While I had spent my summer grieving and letting go of my childhood, my friends were falling in love and entering adulthood. 
 Hey, we should go on a triple date. 
 You should ask Sebastian out. 
 Ask him to the new beginnings dance. 
 Maybe he'll hot dog your keyhole. 
 Delightful. 
 That's just how I'll ask him. 
 Well, if you do, then he'll definitely say "Yes." 
 Virgin-- a sexually inexperienced woman, a blank slate unchanged by any past intimate connection or experience. 
 The uninitiated. 
 Yep, that pretty much described me. 
 You stole my hiding place. 
 You hang out here a lot? 
 Yeah. Yeah, it's a pretty good escape. 
 You had a lot to get away from. 
 If only I could escape my brain. 
 Do you ever-- do you ever just sit there, and--and the words and thoughts are, like, happening so fast in your mind that you just-- 
 you can't even understand them? 
 Not really. 
 Oh. 
 I wish I hadn't just said that, then. 
 I think it's cool you have so much going on in your head. 
 You've been through stuff. 
 Not many people here can say that. 
 Can you? 
 Who, me? 
 Poor little rich kid whose mom left with the tennis instructor? 
 I'm just a cliche. 
 Your mom left? I'm sorry. I didn't know-- 
 Oh, don't worry. 
 Our maid Luisa still gets dinner on the table. 
 Nothing's really changed. 
 Nobody's better off without a mom. 
 Uh... 
 I'm sorry, Carrie. 
 It was hard to believe it was only last year we had spent the summer hanging out. 
 I can't believe you don't know Atari "Adventure". 
 No way. "Space Invaders." That's my game. 
 I mean, come on. You get to kill aliens. 
 Oh, you're crazy. No, "Adventure" is so cool. 
 You have to get this magic chalice to a gold castle, and then there's these dragons that are trying to kill you. 
 So you're the princess who slays their own dragons? 
 Well, somebody has to. Might as well be me, right? 
 I'd slay a dragon for you. 
 Suddenly everything was different. 
 I knew he was gonna kiss me, so I did what any scared 15-year-old girl would do. 
 Ohh! Aah! 
 Aah! Oh, now you're in for it. 
 No! Stop. Stop. 
 Aah! 
 It was a moment I wanted to last forever. 
 My first kiss. 
 My, uh, parents are putting in a pool at our house. 
 It's almost done. 
 Oh. Cool. 
 Once he had his own pool, I knew I would never see him again. 
 And I was right... 
 Until today. 
 Do you still swim? 
 Yeah. Yeah, I really love it. 
 I never swim. 
 Really? That's kind of a waste since you have a pool in your backyard. 
 Hey, would you, um-- I should... 
 You. Me? 
 Yeah. 
 Me. Okay. Um... 
 Would you, uh... 
 Would--would you... 
 Check it out. 
 Would you wanna go to... 
 Would you want... 
 Why was my father here? 
 The last time I had seen him in these halls, I lost the most important person in my life. 
 You need to come home. 
 Your mom's unconscious. 
 It won't be too much longer. 
 Carrie? Are you okay? 
 Carrie? 
 Carrie? Are you okay? 
 Carrie? Carrie? 
 Whoa! 
 Give her some air. 
 Is she all right? Kiddo? 
 Kiddo, can you hear me? Carrie?! 
 Bye! 
 Thanks for keeping an eye on her. 
 Of course, Mr. Bradshaw. 
 I better head back in. 
 Oh. I'll call you later. Okay. 
 Bye. 
 I'm taking you home. 
 Dad, I'm fine. 
 You fainted. I just got scared when I saw you. 
 You know, the last time you were here... 
 Yeah. Yeah, I'm sorry. I should've-- 
 I should've told you I was coming in to meet with your guidance counselor. 
 Yeah, you should have, and I don't need some shrink talking about how screwed up I am. 
 That's not what we were talking about. 
 Then what? You've been through a lot, and we thought maybe it might be a good idea if you had a change of pace, a change of scenery. 
 You're shipping me off to a loony bin. 
 Some would call it that... Or call me crazy for agreeing to this, but what about an internship? 
 One day a week, for school credit, of course. 
 Like, work in an office? 
 Where? 
 My friend's law firm in Manhattan. 
 Manhattan? 
 No way! Aah! No way! 
 What would I be doing? Do--do I need to type? 
 Because I'm not very good at that. 
 I just--I can't believe it. I-I can't believe it. 
 Okay, I guess--I guess you really are feeling okay. 
 Now, look, I know this all sounds really cool, right? Yeah. 
 But it's also a lot of responsibility. 
 New York is an intense place, and you're gonna have to prove to me that you can handle it. 
 I will. I promise. I'll be a total professional. 
 Will I need a briefcase? 
 Dorrit. 
 I start my job tomorrow. Can I have the purse back? 
 I know you have it. You mean your lame internship? 
 Like I care. 
 Please, can I have mom's purse back? 
 Maybe you lost it. 
 You won't mind if I look around. 
 Get away from my stuff. 
 You're such a klepto. 
 It's covered in nail polish. 
 Oh--oh, my God. 
 It's ruined. 
 Why did you do that? 
 I didn't mean to. The bottle must have broke. 
 You wanted to destroy it. 
 No. 
 I wanted something of mom, and you got everything. 
 No, I, don't. You got the purse. 
 Your 16th birthday. The start of high school. 
 I got nothing. 
 I never thought of myself as the lucky one, but I had precious extra years with our mom that Dora would never have. 
 You're okay, Dorrit. 
 You're okay. 
 Mom loved you. 
 So much. 
 I don't need your pity. 
 I'm just trying to-- You think because you always acted like such a goody-goody around mom that you can boss me around? Well, screw you. 
 You're pissed at me? I should be angry at you. 
 You ruined mom's purse. 
 You know what? I'm glad I did. 
 Now you can't have it, either. 
 I realized I had a choice. 
 I could blame Dorrit, or I could let go of my anger and still find a way to hold on to my mother and to the purse.

 She knows that I wanna wait until I am. 
 To have s*x? 
 You guys haven't? No. 
 I didn't understand. If Maggie wasn't a virgin, and Walt had said "No," who had said "Yes"? 
 I must be the only 17-year-old guy saying "No" to his girlfriend. 
 Did your dad call the cops on you? 
 What? 
 Why would he do that? 
 Dad, I-I'm--I'm here! 
 I'm here. I'm sorry I'm late. 
 Uh, we ended up walking home. 
 It's Dorrit. 
 She's missing. 
 What? 
 Something horrible might have happened to her. 
 She's okay, dad. 
 This never would have happened if your mother was here. 
 I will kill her when she gets home. 
 Hey. 
 Dorrit. 
 Where have you been? 
 Whatever. With friends. 
 I tried to call. The phone must have been off the hook. 
 Because you took it off. 
 Are you drunk? 
 Do you know how worried we've been? 
 You better start explaining yourself. 
 Or what? 
 You'll ground me? 
 You're not my mom. 
 I'm done. 
 I'm just done. 
 Do you think I like this? 
 Worrying about you? 
 And having to be the mature one? 
 I would do anything. 
 I would do anything to have mom back and just to be your sister and not have to worry every day what might happen to you. I just... 
 Ugh! I can't take it! 
 Kiddo. 
 I'm--I'm sorry. 
 Don't be. 
 You know... 
 I saw a lot of your mother in you today. 
 Because I lost it? 
 When you were little, and you'd do something awful, I would just look at your tear-stained face and I'd melt. 
 I couldn't punish you. 
 Your mother was tough. 
 Yeah, I remember. 
 When I did cartwheels in the pizza place, she wouldn't let me go to Valerie Weiss' 7th birthday party. 
 And she had a moon bounce in the backyard. 
 Well, she wanted you girls to be accountable, said it would make you good people. 
 And now that's my job. 
 I haven't wanted to do it. 
 You girls have been through enough as it is. 
 But also, um... 
 By taking on your mom's role... 
 That means I would have to admit that, uh... 
 That mom's really gone. 
 Yeah. 
 But I have to. 
 It's what your mother would have wanted, no matter how much it hurts. 
 She also would have wanted me to ground you for coming in an hour past your curfew. 
 So... no more going out the next two weeks. Okay? 
 Okay. 
 Okay. 
 You don't seem too upset about that. 
 No. 
 Mouse. Hi. 
 What's wrong? 
 Are you okay? 
 I think Seth is breaking up with me. 
 Why? What happened? 
 He hasn't called in two days. 
 Well, that's nothing, right? 
 I called a bunch. 
 No, mouse. How many times? 
 Too many. 
 Well... 
 Well, you know, maybe he's just studying? 
 Yeah. 
 How could he have... 
 Had s*x with me and treat me like this? 
 Come here. 
 Oh, I'm sorry. 
 Love is something we wait for. 
 We imagine our first kiss, our first s*x, our first "I love you." 
 But we never imagine our first heartbreak. 
 Maybe because it's too painful to even imagine. 
 But in a way, the pain of love is what truly changes us.

 Can I keep them? 
 Of course.

 I was searching for me--
