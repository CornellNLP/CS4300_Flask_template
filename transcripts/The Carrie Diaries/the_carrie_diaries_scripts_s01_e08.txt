 [ Carrie ] Before there was s*x,  before there was the city, there was just me... Carrie. Carrie Bradshaw. And things changing for me in Manhattan... 
 And now for the grand finale... 
 No way! My purse! 
 Come and work for me at "Interview." 
 I don't know if I can take the job. 
 What? 
 In case you've forgotten, I'm 16. 
 Well, Larissa has no idea. 
 I wanted to talk to you about my internship at the law firm. 
 You know, a lot of work went into getting you this job. 
 We can't mess this up. 
 And for my friends... 
 What are you doing here? 
 Aren't you here with your boyfriend? 
 He is sick. 
 Admit it. It's always more fun when you're with me. 
 If you don't want people finding out, including your  boyfriend, 
 you will keep Carrie away from Sebastian. 
 And with the guys in my life. 
 Nice to meet you. 
 I didn't know you had a new boyfriend. 
 I don't think who I'm dating is any of your business. 
 You're with Donna, and I'm cool with that. 
 If you're so into this guy, why were you paying so much attention to me? 
 George, I'm not sure I can... 
 Oh, sure you can. 
 I'm not having s*x with you. 
 I'm breaking up with you. 
 Welcome to "Interview." 
 [ Bow wow wow's "I want candy" 
 playing ] 
 We all have secrets. 
 When we're little, they start off innocent... 
 A hiding place, a stash of candy, a hush-hush crush. 
 But as we get older, our secrets get bigger and better. 
 My dad thought I was headed to  an internship 
 at a windowless Manhattan law firm. 
 If only he knew. 
 ♪ I want candy  
 "Interview" magazine... 
 Home to my glamorous, new secret life. 
 This goes to layout, this to the prop stylist... 
 Mm-hmm. 
 And this is my lunch order. 
 Looking good, boys. What do you think? 
 Here at "Interview," 
 everything was out in the open... literally. 
 Uh... 
 It's "Miami vice" meets "my little pony." 
 And don't say you like it if you don't. 
 Always say what you really feel. 
 We never pretend around here. Wastes time. 
 Ah, I love it. Mnh! Give it back! 
 Larissa, this thing is broken again. 
 Did you hit the escape button? 
 There's a button that'll help me escape this hell? 
 Oh. I-I hate these computers. 
 When are people going to admit this is a fade that is just going to go away? 
 What's wrong with it? 
 The thing is... 
 [ Thump ] 
 Is stuck in the thing. 
 Well, it looks like the floppy disk is stuck in the drive. 
 What's a floppy disk? 
 [ Scoffs ] How do you even know all this stuff? 
 I knew 'cause they make me 
 take computer literacy sixth period. 
 [ Disk pops ] 
 But that was another secret I was keeping. 
 You re my hero. That was  amazing. 
 I need you desperately. Come with me now. 
 "Interview" was all-consuming. 
 It almost made me forget about  my boy troubles at home. 
 Almost. 
 But somehow, no matter how busy I was, 
 I wasn't totally able to forget about Sebastian. 
 ♪ Hey! 
 ♪ Hey! 
 ♪ Hey! 
 [ Binder thuds ] 
 [ Indistinct conversations ] 
 Hey. 
 How come whenever I see you, you run the other direction? 
 Not everyone chases after you like a pathetic puppy dog. 
 That's Donna's job. 
 All right, is this about Bradshaw? 
 You did stare at her the entire winter dance like a psychopath. 
 That could have something to do with it. 
 Causing a scene isn't really my thing. 
 I feel bad about it. 
 And you should. If you're with Donna, it shouldn't matter what Carrie's doing. 
 Hey, wait. Uh... 
 So she's... Happy with that guy? 
 Enthralled. Joyous. Dreamboat living. 
 And you're perfectly happy with Donna, so this conversation is moot. Pointless. 
 Superfluous, some might say. 
 Yeah, but Donna and I... 
 Well... 
 I would say w-we're... 
 What? Use your words. 
 Well, I've been trying to figure out a way to... 
 You know... 
 Break up? 
 Um... 
 [ Lowered voice ] No one's ever broken up with Donna Ladonna! 
 Yeah. I think she wants to keep it that way. 
 I'm pretty sure she's been avoiding me. 
 Wait. Are you breaking up with Donna because you wanna date Carrie? 
 No. No, I'm just... 
 Not the kind of guy who dates a girl he's not into. 
 Donna deserves better. 
 All Donna deserves it to be fed to the Jens in a cage. 
 [ Chuckles ] 
 So we good? 
 You didn't hear it from me, but Carrie and George? 
 Over. 
 While the mouse was 
 telling Sebastian one of my secrets, 
 Maggie couldn't stop thinking about 
 the one she was keeping from Walt. 
 Uh, "E.T.," "Wrath of Khan"" 
 "tender mercies." There'll be something for everybody. 
 Great. And I talked to the deejay. 
 He promised he would end the lock-in with your favorite song, "our lips are sealed." 
 Cool. 
 Yeah. 
 Dating the guy in charge of music & movies has its perks. 
 That sounds nice. 
 Oh, yeah. And Molly Ringwald is coming. 
 That's great. 
 Earth to Mags. What's going on? 
 What? Nothing. 
 Come on. I know when something's up. 
 You get that look. I don't get a look. 
 You do. If it's something good, you get that dreamy smile. 
 But if it's something bad, you look kind of like a dazed robot. 
 A pretty one, but kind of out of it. 
 Did something bad happen? 
 I'm starting to worry. 
 And finally, Maggie was ready to tell Walt the truth. 
 No more secrets. 
 Look... there's something I did and I'm not proud of it. 
 Okay. 
 Two words, you guys! Big news. 
 Just give us a sec, okay? 
 No, it's fine. What's up? 
 Sebastian's breaking up with Donna. 
 What? 
 For Maggie, this just added to her burdens. 
 With Donna on the loose, 
 it was only a matter of time before her secret came out. 
 You're  dumping  me? 
 Yeah. 
 [ Laughs ] 
 This is a first. 
 You all right? 
 [ Scoffs ] Please. I'm fine. 
 I think we both know this was fizzling out. 
 So then this is a good thing. 
 Of course. 
 [ Chuckles ] Do me a little favor? 
 Can we not tell anyone until after the lock-in? 
 This'll just be our little secret until saturday. 
 Um... I have to ask. Why? 
 As much as I love being the center of attention, I only like it when it's the fawning kind, not the, "oh, poor Donna"" kind. 
 And since I'm in charge of the lock-in, I want it to be perfect. 
 My moment... in a  good  way. 
 You are one honest and ballsy chick. 
 I know. 
 And boy will you miss me. 
 I had a good time with you. 
 I'm glad we could end this without any drama. 
 Me, too. 
 And I hope you don't mind, but I will be telling people that  I  broke up with  you. 
 [ Chuckles ] 
 Well, have at it. 
 Oh, you wouldn't believe the legs on this babe! 
 And her rack is insane! 
 They're real, too. 
 I got a grab while pretending to trip. 
 Boy, she sounds like a real catch. 
 The only problem is, she won't go out with me without a sidechick. 
 Sidechick? 
 Yeah, a friend who comes along to make sure I... You know, I behave myself. 
 Apparently, she thinks I'm some sort of lecherous pig. 
 So she's met you? 
 Hup. Hey. 
 These ladies get dinner and a limo, and you can, too, if you help me out. 
 [ Laughs ] I am not sure that this is how I wanna enter the dating world. 
 Who said anything about a date? 
 You just did. 
 Forget what I said. It's not a date. 
 You're just helping a friend get laid. It's totally different. 
 [ Clears throat ] Look, I, uh, I hope things work out between you and your lady friend. 
 I mean, clearly you two have a promising future together. But I... 
 But you would rather spend the night on the couch, eating a giant bag of cheese doodles, fighting with your daughters over the remote control? 
 No. 
 Carrie's going to a High School thing, and Dorrit's got a sleepover, so I'm gonna be on my own, on the couch, with a giant bag of cheese doodles. 
 [ Laughs ] Tom, come on! 
 Dinner at a steak place! 
 I'm payin'! 
 [ Sighs ] I do love a good steak. 
 You can pretend the ladies aren't even there. 
 Fine. Uh, just dinner. Attaboy. 
 All right, enough of this chitchat. I gotta get to work. 
 Uh, Carrie... she keeping up with you big city lawyer types? 
 Yeah. I hear good things. 
 I mean, let's hope she makes a better lawyer than her dad. 
 [ Laughs ] I'm proud of her. 
 You coming up to say "hi"? 
 I'm not really sure what floor she's on, but... 
 Nah. 
 No, I don't want to intrude on her work. 
 I'll talk to ya. All right. 
 Dinner. 
 Yeah. 
 Steak! 
 Ladies! 
 [ Laughs ] 
 [ Camera shutter clicking ] 
 ♪ 
 [ camera shutter clicks ] 
 [ Camera shutter clicks ] 
 Cheat your heel out a skosh, darling. 
 Like this? 
 Perfection! Oh! 
 You are saving my life. 
 All I did was put on shoes. 
 Well, my little Cinderella, you're the only one in the office with feet small enough to fit them. Brilliant. 
 Make it art. 
 And then it dawned on me... 
 Maybe the reason Cinderella was so happy the shoe fit 
 wasn't because of the prince. 
 It was because of the shoes. 
 Who needed Sebastian when I had these? 
 Fabulous work, everyone! 
 Carrie, your feet are  spectacular. 
 They're divine, really. 
 Well, my feet thank you. 
 Careful. They may get too big for these shoes if they get any more praise. 
 [ Chuckles ] 
 Not like I'll ever get to wear them again. 
 Of course you will. They're yours. 
 No, they're... 
 "Bloonik" somebody's. 
 Manolo Blahnik, darling. 
 And they loaned them to us, which means they gave them to us. 
 Actually, "loan" means... Well, "loaned." 
 Well, it was extremely hostile of them to send such a small size, so you should keep them. 
 Wear them to limelight on friday. 
 The club at the church? 
 It's... that's so wrong, yet somehow so right. 
 It's where we go after we close the issue, to celebrate and to worship at the altar of fun. 
 Oh, and don't tell me you've got somewhere better to be. 
 Oh, friday I have the lock-in. 
 I couldn't believe it. 
 I just told her I was going to  an all-night High School party. 
 Hmm. Is that a new bondage club? 
 Those are popping up everywhere. 
 Uh, yeah. 
 Ohh. 
 You are so clicked in. Hiring you was genius. 
 Let's go there instead. 
 Well, um, actually, I stopped short because, uh, it closed. 
 Just forgot for a minute. 
 Oh. Well, that's better anyway, darling. 
 Limelight's where it's at. 
 And don't tell me you can't make it. 
 If you're one of us, you will be there. 
 The lock-in 
 and the guy who wouldn't tell me if there was an "us," 
 or limelight and Larissa, 
 who thought of me as part of an "us"? 
 Yeah. Of course I'll be there. 
 She gave you shoes and invited you to a party? 
 Ugh. I so need to get a job. 
 [ Laughs ] Only, the only one I could get would involve saying, "please pay at the next window"" 
 well, technically, limelight is kinda work since the whole staff is going. 
 What about the Junior-senior lock-in? 
 We've been talking about it since we were freshmen. 
 I know, but it's the perfect cover. 
 I mean, what are the odds Larissa invites me out on the one night I actually have a legitimate excuse to stay out  all  night? 
 It's like the universe is helping me keep my secret. 
 Your dad has no clue what's up? 
 He still thinks I'm getting lost in file cabinets, not going out in to die for shoes and a sparkly dress. 
 And bitchy Barbara said she'd cover for me indefinitely. 
 I should probably get a new name for her. 
 I can't believe she's helping me do this. 
 Bodacious Barbara? 
 Unh-unh. Meet her before you name her. 
 You have to tell your dad about "Interview" someday, right? 
 Oh. Yeah, when I'm, like, 107. 
 I mean, he'd be crushed. 
 Plus, he wouldn't let me set foot in limelight, let alone my whole body. 
 You are gonna meet so many hot guys. 
 I'd settle for an uncomplicated, available one. 
 What about Sebastian? 
 And I repeat, I'd take available. 
 He said he's going to break up with Donna. 
 Well, if he is, he seems to be keeping it a secret. 
 I mean, we would know if they broke up. 
 That's true. 
 Donna would somehow be making it seem like a good thing. 
 She's so scary. 
 Yes, she is. Very. 
 And there were other secrets that Maggie had 
 which made Sebastian off-limits to me. 
 I say go to limelight. 
 Why do you want to get involved with this whole Sebastian drama? 
 Because he likes her. He basically admitted it. 
 And you like him, right? 
 I think you have to wait. 
 You never know, getting involved with someone who's already involved. 
 People get hurt. 
 When have you ever cared about Donna? 
 I care about Carrie. 
 Well, if you do, you'd want her to go to the lock-in. 
 Ugh! None of this matters. 
 I'm not gonna pine after some guy who's already dating somebody else. 
 [ Knock on door ] 
 Come in! 
 Oh. Hi, girls. 
 Um, I-I found this in the garage. 
 You know, thought you might want it. 
 Oh. No one sleeps at this. 
 Oh. 
 But thank you. 
 I'll be glad to have it, so that I'm comfortable... 
 At the lock-in. 
 Well, Dorrit has a sleepover, so, uh, I made some plans, too. 
 I hope that's okay. 
 Yeah, of course. 
 Harlan and I are going out for steaks. 
 Cool. 
 I like steak. 
 You know? 
 I like steak, too. 
 What time should I pick you up in the morning? 
 Oh. Um... Maggie's gonna take me home. 
 'Cause I drive now. 
 Oh. I'm going, too. 
 Yep. We're all going. 
 [ Whispers ] Okay. 
 [ Sighs ] [ Chuckles ] 
 [ Whispers ] Do you think he bought it? 
 You're so good, I'm starting to think you like lying. 
 I don't like so much as getting really good at it. 
 You know? 
 Practice makes perfect. 
 [ Laughs ] 
 I hate that Donna has this over me. 
 Me, too. That's why you have to tell Walt. 
 I know. I keep trying... And chickening out. 
 Mm. Now I'm ruining your shot at happiness. 
 Sebastian isn't into me. 
 Otherwise, he would've broken up with Donna. 
 As someone who can speak from experience, telling someone something they won't wanna hear is not easy. 
 Well, maybe. 
 He was staring at you while you were I think George. 
 Maybe it's a sign? 
 Well, if that was his sign, it was so small I couldn't even read it, you know? 
 Get a bigger sign, buddy. 
 There he was, my not-so-secret crush. 
 Hey. Hi. 
 Hey. 
 [ Slams locker door ] 
 [ Whispers ] Um... 
 "Hey. Hi"? 
 Way to win me over with your enthusiasm. 
 I mean, is it so wrong that I want a grand gesture? 
 Someone to sweep me off my feet? 
 Now wasn't the perfect timing for more. 
 [ Sighs ] That's the thing. 
 With me and Sebastian, it's never the right time. 
 And I'm done. I'm not wasting any more energy on this. 
 'Cause you know who  does  want to sweep me off my feet? 
 Manhattan. 
 Manhattan invited me to a party. 
 Well, Larissa did, but you know what I mean. 
 Now I am going to limelight. 
 [ Shoe thuds ] 
 It's true what they say... 
 When one door closes, a shoebox opens. 
 Or in Walt's case, a movie canister. 
 Those better be the movies for the lock-in. 
 Most people would actually be polite and say, "thank you, Walt, for doing all this work." 
 But yes, they are. Arrived last night. 
 I think it's so cool your dad knows someone who works in the movie business. 
 One of my dad's fraternity brothers. 
 Apparently, the brotherhood of Dartmouth can get you the goods. 
 Hollywood  and  a fraternity connection. 
 You're a lot cooler than you put out, Walt. 
 Yeah. 
 [ Canister clanks ] 
 I, uh, try not to lead with my coolness. 
 And I have a surprise for you. 
 [ Canister clanks ] 
 "Rocky III"? 
 How did you know that was my favorite? 
 Two little birdies told me. 
 Or the Jens. 
 I'm surprised that's your favorite movie. 
 I figured you'd like "flashdance" or something. 
 Are you kidding? 
 Muscles and guys punching each other? Mr. T.? 
 [ Laughs ] Yes, please. 
 Okay. 
 [ Chuckles ] 
 You're a really nice guy, Walt. Really thoughtful. 
 Just doin' my job. 
 Or the job you made me do. 
 I hope Maggie knows how special you are. 
 She does. 
 Donna suddenly realized 
 exactly how she would use Maggie's secret to her benefit. 
 Because you deserve to be with someone who really... Appreciates you. 
 Excuse me. 
 Oh. Oh. 
 We have three quarter pounders with cheese, two Denver omelets, and a jumbo French toast. 
 It's a lock-in, Maggie, not prison. 
 They do let us out eventually. 
 I like to have comfort food around. 
 You never know when you're gonna need it. 
 [ Door bells jingle ] 
 Hello, man who doesn't do what he says he'll do. 
 Come on, mouse. 
 Why haven't you broken up with Donna? 
 It's a little more complicated than that. 
 Ugh, please. That is such a load of crap. 
 It's just code for "big, giant wuss." 
 When you see us at the lock-in, don't say hi. 
 Well, I'm not going, so... 
 You too cool for it? 
 I just don't really wanna be there. 
 Could be awkward. 
 Why? 
 Did Donna ask you to have a menage a trois with the Jens? 
 That would be four people, so technically an orgy. 
 I thought you were better than this. 
 I thought you were the kind of guy who would do the right thing, but I guess you're not. 
 All right, we broke up yesterday. 
 But don't say anything. 
 Donna wanted to keep it hush-hush until after the lock-in, and I agreed because I don't want any drama. 
 Was she okay about it? 
 She was Donna about it. 
 Vengeful Donna, looking for someone to take it out on Donna, or too cool to care Donna? 
 Since when do any of us care about Donna? 
 The question is, what are you going to do  now? 
 Eat a grilled cheese. 
 Don't be obtuse. I mean with Carrie. 
 You do like her, right? 
 I know you like her. Say it. Say it. Say it. 
 Yeah, I do. 
 I knew it! I knew it. 
 So what are you gonna do about it? 
 Thought I might see if she wanted to see a movie sometime. 
 Maybe "the flamingo kid"? 
 Flamingos aren't gonna cut it, not after you "hey, hi'd" her. 
 Mouse is right. 
 As much as your breakup with Donna could have serious repercussions, Carrie deserves to be happy. 
 She's kind of a big deal now, going to big clubs in the big city. 
 Who knows who she could meet tonight? 
 So if you like her, it's time for a big gesture. 
 I mean,  huge. 
 I was thinking a little bigger than a phone call. 
 We have to be practical here. Clock's ticking. 
 Uh, it's ringing. 
 [ Telephone rings ] 
 [ Ring ] 
 [ Ring ] 
 [ Ring ] 
 [ Sighs ] Well, a grand gesture can wait, I guess. 
 Oh, we should go. 
 I need to meet up with Walt at the lock-in. 
 Well, at least someone will have a romantic night. 
 Not sure about that. You ready? 
 Yeah. 
 How would you guys feel about missing the lock-in? 
 I can't. I really need this night with Walt to talk. 
 And I'm kind of excited about the s'mores on the bunsen burner. Why? 
 Just wondering if you're up for an adventure. 
 What kind of adventure? 
 Let's go find Bradshaw. 
 Are you serious? 
 Yeah, if Bradshaw wants a grand gesture, I'm willing to give her one. 
 You're gonna chase her to New York. 
 That's, like, the grandest grand gesture ever. 
 I am so in. 
 All right. 
 Do you know how to get to limelight? 
 Yeah. Sure. I've been there before. 
 Used to hang out in the city on weekends when I was up at boarding school. 
 Wait. How do we even get in? 
 It's, like, impossible, right? 
 And it's so far. 
 What if there's traffic? 
 We can't just start driving. 
 There are logistics we need to work out first. 
 Logistics are for lame asses who don't know what they want. 
 I know what I want. 
 And you want Carrie. 
 It's really romantic. 
 You comin'?

 [ Laughs ] 
 ♪ 
 your drink. 
 [ Gasps ] 
 Oh, it's so pretty. 
 [ Gasps ] What's it called? 
 A Cosmopolitan, for a Cosmopolitan. 
 Mmm! Oh! 
 [ Laughs ] 
 I think this is going to be my drink. 
 Mmm. It's so nice. 
 You're nice. 
 Hmm. 
 Nice? That means I'm boring. 
 No, you're not boring. 
 Then you have somebody waiting for you at home. 
 No! No. 
 Nope, there's... there's nobody. 
 Good, 'cause I have plans for you. 
 Mm! 
 What kind of plans? 
 Dancing. 
 Mm. 
 Cute boys? Delicious drinks? 
 My secret night was feeling more and more like a dream... 
 [ Horns honking ] 
 While mouse worried hers was turning into a nightmare. 
 [ Emotion pictures' 
 "rescue remedy" on radio ] [ Turns down volume ] All right. Let's focus. First, we have to get out of this lane. Because the other one's going so much faster. Honk! Maybe they'll let you through. We're in a Porsche, not an ambulance. I'll tell you what. Why don't I close my eyes, and you take the wheel? I'm just trying to help. Okay, what are you going to say to Carrie? I mean, are you gonna pull her outside or talk to her in the club? Wait. If you guys go off, how am I getting home? We really should've thought this through. All right, mouse, relax. It'll be perfect. Okay? [ Sighs deeply ] [ Turns up volume ]  ♪ driving through right down the freeway ♪ check paid. Where to next? Somewhere where they have dom. Excellent. If it's okay, we'll just hit the powder room before we go. Yeah, we'll get your coats. [ Exhales deeply ] [ Whispers ] Sit. So? Okay. Okay, yeah, you were right. Glad I came. Tonight was fun. No. No, that's not what I mean. How are you gonna play this? What is your next move? I'm... going home. You said you had no kids tonight. Risa is practically eating out of your hand. I gave her a bite of salmon off of my fork. She's gaga laughing over your lame stories. Uh, thank you? She's kinda cute. In a yuppie sort of way... Killer bod, jazzercise ass. I didn't notice. I mean, she could use a boob job. You are crazy. Her breasts... Gotcha. Look, we don't have much time. They are in the bathroom having the same conversation we are. This is your shot. Let's keep the party going. [ Indistinct conversations ] The Jens said the projector was broken. I told them to say that. I don't get it. What's going on? I have something to tell you. It's important. [ Carrie ] One thing about secrets is they're hard to let out, even if the one you're telling  isn't yours. It's about Maggie. God, I wish I wasn't the one to have to tell you this. [ The gap band's "you dropped a bomb on me" playing ] This is it. We're here. The big moment. Carrie's inside. We're about to go in. You're gonna get her. You done? Yes. Then let's go get Bradshaw. [ Giggles ] ♪ ...First for me ♪ but you turned me out, baby  [ Carrie ] For the first time in weeks, I wasn't worrying about keeping my secrets. I was having fun just being myself. And the higher we climbed, the more free I felt.

You are coming home with me right now, young lady. Okay, but I have... Now! Carrie, Carrie, is this guy giving you a hard time? No, no, no. It's fine. I'm sorry. Who are you? Hey, Carrie. What are you doing here? That's a good question. I think we'd all like to know. Who is this guy? He's with me. Well, tell him to lighten up and stop acting like he's somebody's dad. I  am  her dad. Oh, this guy's your father? You didn't tell me you were bringing a hot dad. I-I didn't bring him. And what are you doing here? Why were you dancing like that? I am a grown-up, and I am allowed to dance wherever and however I want. You, on the other hand, cannot! Excuse me. Don't talk to your daughter like she's a child. She has a life of her own, you know. She  is  a child. She's 16. You're  16? I thought you were just fresh-faced. What? I'm sorry. Who  are  you? This is unbelievable. I have the youngest, hippest intern, and I didn't even know it! Ha ha! Fabulosity! You're not upset? Are you kidding? I love it. Lady, who the hell are you?! Larissa Loughlin, Carrie's boss. Wait a minute. I'm her boss. I mean, technically. Look, she's my intern at "Interview" magazine. No, she's an intern at my law firm. What, you're a lawyer? Why am I always attracted to the buttoned-up, uptight types? What do you mean, she works for you? Ah, I knew you had the hots for me. Is this true, Carrie? All right, everybody. Let's dance. Great idea. Stop talking, please. Don't talk to me like that. [ All shouting at once ] Everybody, just be quiet! I can explain. [ Carrie ] Exposed secrets are like hand grenades. Or not. If you hang on to them too long, they explode in your face. I wasn't the only one learning that tonight. Hey. I was looking for you. Donna told you. So it's true. How many times were you with him? Well, that's not what matters. [ Exhales ] Wow, that many, huh? I ended it. It will... it will never happen again, ever. You're my girlfriend. That's supposed to mean something. I know. I screwed up. I was confused. We had problems. You're not actually trying to blame me. No. No. This is... This is me. It's all me. It's my fault. I never wanted to hurt you. I feel awful... I don't care how you feel. How you feel means nothing to me. Well, Donna's trying to hurt us. She's trying to hurt me. No. She's trying to protect  me  from  you and all your lies. I don't wanna talk... I don't wanna talk about Donna. I wanna talk about us. There is no us. That's not true. We just have to talk about it. We can get through this. I know it. Maggie! We  don't exist anymore. Ever. While one couple was ending... Another one was giving up hope. I've looked everywhere. I know. Me, too. Where the hell could she be? Oh. Whoa. What... ♪ mouse. There's crazy people. ♪ Should we just go? ♪ dad, slow down. No. Please? But my feet really hurt. Well, you should've thought of that before you put those shoes on. You created your own pain. Yeah, and now I'm in a world of it. Get movin'. [ Siren wailing in distance ] Suddenly, my perfect shoes no longer felt like the perfect fit. [ Indistinct conversations ] Open up! Come on! Let me outta here! Let me out! I hate... I hate this lock-in! [ Inhales and exhales deeply ] What?! You never seen someone lose it before?! You should get ready. It's gonna be gnarly! [ Rattles door ] Which one of you has the key? Huh? Come on! [ Chain rattles ] I gotta get outta here. I gotta get outta here. [ Door and chain rattle ] I can't... [ Exhales ] I gotta get outta here. [ Speaks indistinctly ] [ Chain continues rattling ] There's nothing for me here. Nothing. Meanwhile, mouse and Sebastian  were dealing with their own disappointments. [ Sighs ] I can't believe it. Our grand gesture ruined, destroyed, decimated. We didn't find her, mouse. That's all. Should never have suggested chasing her here. You didn't. I did. I know, but I was going on and on about the grand gesture, and now look at us. We came all the way to Manhattan, and for what? It wasn't for what. It was for Carrie. And maybe I didn't get to surprise her at limelight, but I don't regret it. Tomorrow she'll know I made the grand gesture. There isn't anything that can make me sorry we tried. Uh, what if I told you your car was being towed? Okay, maybe  that. Wait! Stop! Hey. Hi. [ Sighs ] You okay? I'm sorry... [ Sighs ] That I was the one to tell you that it happened at all. Relationships are hard. How would you know? You always get what you want. Sebastian dumped me. I know. Hard to believe, but he did. And you know what? It actually hurts. I didn't know that could happen to me. Someone breaking up with you? Feeling pain. What's wrong with me? There's nothing wrong with you. Then why won't this awful feeling go away? I don't know. I wonder if it ever will. There's nothing wrong with you either. While Walt was moving on from his first love, it looked like I was going to be forced to move on from mine... Manhattan. [ Sighs ] Get in. Can't... can't we just talk about this like adults? No, because you're not an adult. You're a kid. I know that. Do you? Because it didn't seem like you knew that tonight. What the hell were you doing there? At limelight? I could ask you the same. No, you can't, because I am an adult who makes my own decisions... Where I go, what I do. But you are a kid who answers to me. Did you really think you could keep some secret life from me? I mean, what were you thinking? I was thinking... Dad, I-I don't know what I was thinking. That's your problem, Carrie. You don't think. What happened to my daughter? The girl who understood responsibility and... and consequences, who looked before she jumped. What happened to that girl? I don't know. [ Sighs ] I-I didn't mean to... Everything just got out of hand, and... and then there I was, with this whole other life, here in... in Manhattan, and... Well, say good-bye to that life and New York, because you won't be seeing it again... Ever. Putting my shoes away was hard, but I knew they were in a safe place until I could wear them again. Oh, my God, Carrie, I'm so sorry. Mm. To be honest, I'm just trying to block out the whole night, especially the part when I had to kiss Manhattan good-bye. But  what about the Sebastian part? That part I liked. He looked for you for hours. It was like a fairy tale. So romantic and dramatic and  grand. It was a grand gesture. It would have been better if we actually found you, but... Well, that's me, Carrie Bradshaw, master of disappointment. [ Sighs ] So... think you'll go out with Sebastian? I hope so, but I think there's another guy I need to talk to first. I know you're not talking to me. And I know you will never let me go to Manhattan again until I'm an adult. Maybe not even then. And I know what I did was wrong. I lied and kept secrets, and I'm sorry. But last night was more than just a party. Yeah. It was disobeying. It was... Taking advantage of my trust in you. I got you that internship at the law firm because I believed you could handle it. And I can. I'm doing... I was doing a great job at "Interview." They value me. They don't know you, Carrie. They think you're an adult. They didn't value me for those things. By those things, do you mean honesty? Integrity? I took a different job, and, yes, I lied, but I did that because I didn't think you'd understand or say yes. And that's why I had to keep it a secret. You're blaming me for your lies? I'm not the one to blame for this, Carrie. You created this mess. I know. And I wish I had a solution to fix this. But if I hadn't kept it a secret, I would never have been able to experience "Interview," and I couldn't bear that. I mean, I loved it and everything that came with it. Yeah, yeah, I get it. You loved going to the clubs and the parties. No, it wasn't that. I could express myself. It made me think maybe I could be a writer. You're 16. You don't know what you want. But I think I do. And you can stop me from being at "Interview" and seeing Larissa and being in Manhattan, and I can't change any of that. But the one thing you can't stop me from is wanting it and wanting a life that's mine. Often what we want, what we desire is something we keep deep inside of us... Something so dear and so special, it feels too scary to let it out into the open. It's our own little secret, and therefore, safe from harm. [ Elefant ] ♪ good times for a change [ knock on door ]  But maybe we have to let those secrets out in order to actually really live. [ Voice breaks ] Donna told Walt.
