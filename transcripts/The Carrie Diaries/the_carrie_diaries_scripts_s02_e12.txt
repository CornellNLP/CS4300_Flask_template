 Before there was s*x, before there was the city, there was just me, Carrie Carrie Bradshaw from Castlebury, Connecticut. 
 It's from N.Y.U. 
 Aah! I got in! Oh, that's great! I knew this was gonna be hard coming out. 
 So what are you saying? - I can't do this. 
 Mom? I wanna come home. 
 I think there's a market out there that hasn't been tapped into. 
 All based on skate culture. 
 I'm really excited about this, Carrie. 
 I'd definitely consider relocating back to Laguna. 
 You said you'd move. 
 I heard it. 
 I want you to know my life is here. 
 I'm not leaving. 
 I know you wrote the parachute pants piece for him. 
 I just I really wanted to help Bennet out. 
 Stop worrying about Bennet. 
 Think about yourself, because this piece is going in the Magazine under your name. 
 I just got fired. 
 Oh, my gosh. 
 Are you serious? Oh, don't act so shocked, Carrie. 
 What was I supposed to do? Not stab me in the back. 
 It's a bigger desk. 
 Why don't you take it? It was Bennet's. 
 I'd feel weird. 
 You did a good job. 
 You should own that. 
 It's Carrie Bradshaw from âInterviewâ Magazine calling. 
 Originally Aired January 24, 2014 There are things you always envision while growing up, certain long-standing traditions like going dress shopping for your senior prom. 
 What do you think? Wow. 
 You look gorgeous. 
 That do we have a winner? I don't think it's formal enough. 
 Um, maybe something longer. 
 Yeah. 
 You know what? It is too unform It's it's not formal enough. 
 Yeah. 
 I thought that, too. 
 Go long. 
 I thought I would be doing this with my mom. 
 But sometimes, things don't turn out exactly how you imagined. 
 Pretty in pink Which occasionally is a really nice surprise. 
 Holy moly! Mm. 
 I always wondered what Should we roll in it or something? I can't believe we raised this much extra money for the Prom Committee. 
 You raised $6,000 of it? How did you do that? She's got legs she knows how to use them she never begs What can I say? People like a clean car. 
 And your boobs. 
 That, too. 
 What are we gonna do with all this extra money? Ooh! Maybe we could hire one of those skywriting planes and have âClass of '86â scrawled over the Gold Iron Inn. 
 I scrawl âsucksâ over that idea. 
 Don't worry. 
 I can always think of a good way to spend the dollars. 
 Wait. 
 Wait, wait, wait. 
 Why do you have the course catalog from Columbia? No reason. 
 Did you get into Columbia? Maybe. 
 Are you smart?! Be quiet! You are! You are smart! I knew there had to be a reason why I liked you. 
 I don't want anyone else to know. 
 So zip it. 
 Why wouldn't you want people to know you have a brain? Because I want people to know I have a bod. 
 Can't you have both? Not and be Prom Queen. 
 People find out I have geek in me, it might blow up all my hard work. 
 And I'm so close to my goal, so just keep your trap shut. 
 Don't worry. 
 Your secret is safe with me. 
 Nobody would believe me, anyway. 
 So, what's everyone thinking for prom? I got nothing. 
 Me either. 
 I'm going with Pete. 
 Aren't you going with Sebastian? Mm, can't. 
 My adorable hooligan isn't allowed to step foot into any school function since he was expelled. 
 But we're still gonna go, right? With each other? For sure! It's prom. 
 Our Senior Prom. 
 We have to go. 
 Besides, I found a really great dress. 
 Me, too. 
 Then it's settled. 
 We're going as a team. 
 Yay, team. 
 That sounds fun. 
 It will be. 
 All of us together before we head off to our new lives at college. 
 It's our last hurrah. 
 Hurrah. 
 So do you think Pete will let us borrow you for a dance or two? Oh, I think he can deal. 
 And I want a dance with each of my ladies. 
 Done! Gold Iron Inn, here we come. 
 You can kiss my ass whenever you want to begin. 
 Wow, that would be never. 
 Oh, you will change your mind when you hear this. 
 You can all say good-bye to prom at the sad, tired Gold Iron Inn with its crappy food and hideous carpeting. 
 I got the prom moved to the Waldorf Astoria Hotel. 
 In Manhattan? Okay, that is actually ass-kiss worthy. 
 How did you manage that? Th it's so old-world glamour. 
 I used my amazing charm, fantastic cleavage, and our extra 10,000 bucks. 
 Oh, you're a genius. 
 You have no idea. 
 Wow. 
 New York City, here we come. 
 Hurrah! - Hurrah! Hey! No P.D.A. 
 Why? You let me hold your hand in front of your dad sometimes. 
 Yeah, only to piss him off. 
 So you're only hooking up with me to annoy your father? Thanks a lot. 
 And maybe 'cause you're a good kisser. 
 So let me kiss you now. 
 Not gonna happen. 
 So I was thinking of going to the junior/senior prom. 
 Of course you are. 
 Who you gonna take? Um you? See, this is why you're not boyfriend material. 
 You are way too nice and traditional. 
 Asking me to some stupid school dance? That's not my thing. 
 And if you really got me and understood me, - you would know that. 
 I do know that. 
 I wanna go ironically. 
 I'll wear a hideous tux, a ruffled shirt. 
 We can mock everyone. 
 Dance like spazzes, spike the punch. 
 Can you get us a white stretch limo? Done. 
 But you have to wear poofy pink. 
 Only if your tie and cummerbund match my hideously poofy pink dress. 
 It's a deal. 
 I'd shake on it, but I know you don't like hands touching. 
 Oh! And I want a corsage the size of my head. 
 Hi, mom. 
 Wasn't expecting you. 
 I was in the neighborhood. 
 With a puppy. 
 Isn't it so cute? Sure. 
 It's a gift for you from me. 
 Uh, I don't understand. 
 A gift? For what? Can't a mother just wanna give her son something special? Giving someone a puppy isn't really a gift. 
 It's kind of more of a burden. 
 A dog's a crazy responsibility. 
 Tell me about it. 
 It needs so much attention. 
 Keeps wanting to go out all the time and peeing on things and whining. 
 So not really a gift. 
 More like a hand-me-down. 
 It was just so cute and Fluffy. 
 And then it got so big. 
 It just isn't happy in our condo. 
 âItâ? Is âitâ a boy or a girl? And I-I'm not so sure a city loft is gonna be that much better for Him! Oh, look how happy he is with you. 
 I'm just too busy to have a dog right now. 
 Lucas and I have so many vacations planned. 
 I don't think I can take this dog, mom. 
 I'm really swamped with work stuff. 
 So you'd abandon this sweet little thing? I think that's what you're doing. 
 That was hurtful. 
 I just know you're here all by yourself, and I want you to have some companionship. 
 I don't want you to be alone. 
 Yeah. 
 You'd never let that happen. 
 Oh, come on. 
 You two practically match. 
 You have to keep him. 
 I'll just go get his things. 
 They're in the hall. 
 Carrie! Darling. 
 Ah, good morning. 
 No, it's a great morning because I have fabulous news. 
 It took some convincing, but I fought for you, and now it's official. 
 You have a job at âInterviewâ Magazine. 
 And you start immediately. 
 A summer job here? No. 
 All four seasons. 
 So it's a part-time job? Full-time, darling. 
 But I'm going to N. 
 Y. 
 U. 
 In the fall. 
 Whatever for, Poppins? To get an education and a degree. 
 A degree is bollocks. 
 All these people have applied for the job I just gave you. 
 And they just graduated from Columbia or N. 
 Y. 
 U. 
 Or some other confusing jumble of three letters. 
 Why waste four years going to university in order to get a job that you've already been given? And one I fought for you to have, I might add. 
 And and I'm honored and thrilled you did that. 
 So why I haven't I heard a resounding âyesâ from you yet? Oh. 
 Ow. 
 So how long is this little mutt supposed to be around? It's just visiting, right? It's a he. 
 Ollie. 
 You already named him? I-I can't just ditch him. 
 He's already been left once by someone in my family. 
 Do you know how many times he's going to have to go to the bathroom? You'll have to take him out constantly. 
 I already am taking him out constantly. 
 And because of that, I am seeing a whole new side of New York like garbage everywhere and other people's dog poop. 
 And I'm pretty sure people poop. 
 Oh, ew! I'm eating here. 
 I just it's kind of hard now that I'm getting so busy with work. 
 But it's going well, right? Really well. 
 I love it. 
 You do, don't you? I feel like I've finally found my thing, like you have with writing. 
 So you think I should take the job at âInterviewâ? It's your dream job, right? Yeah! But I'm excited about college, too. 
 You know, being on the N.Y.U. 
 Campus, studying from big, dusty old books at the library, eating out late with my roommates while bonding over the classics. 
 College is a rite of passage. 
 But maybe it's one you don't need. 
 True. 
 But what about my dad? Can you imagine having to tell him that I'm not going to college? He would freak. 
 Yes, he would. 
 He's a traditional guy. 
 I just wish my dad wasn't so focused on how things should be. 
 Sometimes I wish he was more like your parents. 
 That's a sentence I never thought - I'd hear in this lifetime. 
 Oh, you know what I mean. 
 Just that you're finding your own way in the world, and they're okay with it. 
 They can see how doing things a different way is all right. 
 For my dad, it's just his way or no way. 
 I hear Carrie got you guys a stretch limo for prom. 
 So glamorous. 
 I'm not going. 
 What? Why? Because prom is stupid. 
 Well, of course it is. 
 That's not a reason not to go. 
 It is tradition to mock it and love it at the same time. 
 Just seems like more trouble than it's worth now. 
 It's gonna take an hour to get into the city, at least. 
 So you're not going anymore because it's in the city? Maybe. 
 I don't know. 
 I just haven't been back there since I, you know, broke up with Bennet. 
 I want that part of my life to be in the past, and going into the city would make it in the present. 
 Well, if you're not going, I'm not going. 
 Then I guess you're not going. 
 Hmm. 
 We made a pact freshman year to be each other's prom dates, no matter what, remember? I was a foot taller than you back then. 
 Yeah. 
 A lot's changed. 
 Not how much I want to go to prom with you. 
 Aren't you going with Pete? Eh, you know what? Not anymore. 
 I will tell him that I need to go with a friend a friend that I made a promise to a very long time ago. 
 He'll understand. 
 You would choose me over Pete? Yeah. 
 So you're going? All right! I'll go. 
 Good. 
 But remember, we're just going as friends. 
 Don't try anything. 
 That Saturday night, i prepared for my senior prom. 
 You look beautiful. 
 Aw, thanks, dad. 
 What I wasn't prepared for Move it on over! Pink cupcake coming down. 
 Whoa. 
 How do I look? So pretty. 
 You really do. 
 Ugh. 
 Aren't I every little girl's princess dream? I'm guessing you won't pose for a photo? Oh, I will. 
 All right. 
 Later, losers. 
 I'm off to meet Scott. 
 Ah, right. 
 Have a good night. 
 Just what I always dreamed of Dorrit at my prom. 
 To us! Whoo! I am on record on saying that you are crazy to consider, even for a second, not going to college. 
 I think you need college on your resume. 
 Well, not if I'm writing stories for âInterview. 
 â but what if that job doesn't work out and you don't have a college degree? Well, then you could be me. 
 I'm sure Pete has a cute friend. 
 We could be army wives. 
 Yeah, I kinda can't see myself like that. 
 Can you see yourself like this? Maggie! Wa-hoo! Prom, baby! Yeah! Excuse me, sir. 
 Do you have any Grey Poupon? If this was the way the night was beginning - Whoo! I couldn't imagine how it might end. 
 As seniors, prom is a traditional rite of passage a time to get dressed up, make memories And acknowledge for just one moment that you are at the top of your high school game. 
 Then come and rock me, Amadeus Amadeus, Amadeus Amadeus Amadeus, Amadeus Amadeus Amadeus, Amadeus oh, oh, Amadeus For us, it was a celebration of friendship. 
 Amadeus, Amadeus Amadeus Amadeus, Amadeus Amadeus Amadeus, Amadeus Amadeus oh, oh, Amadeus now come and rock me, Amadeus Amadeus, Amadeus Amadeus Amadeus, Amadeus Amadeus Amadeus, Amadeus oh, oh, Amadeus come and rock me, Amadeus oh, oh, oh oh, oh, oh-oh oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh-oh I think our arms need to be even stiffer. 
 Like this. 
 And we need even less rhythm. 
 This is actually fun. 
 Oh, it's just the beginning. 
 Next up? Hideous pictures and punch spiking. 
 I like the way you think. 
 Warm nights almost left behind I'm so glad we're all here together. 
 Me, too. 
 And you're not too bummed that you're not here with Sebastian? Well, it would've been nice to see him in a tux. 
 He'd be so handsome in a tux. 
 But it wasn't meant to be, I guess. 
 You okay? Of course. 
 Why wouldn't I be? I just thought maybe a part of you wants to be dancing with Bennet. 
 No. 
 That part of my life is o-v-e-r. 
 Actually, I wanted to talk to you about him. 
 I don't really want to, Carrie. 
 You can look and you will find me Well, I've been trying to figure out a way to tell you this but, uh, Bennet was fired from âInterviewâ a few weeks ago. 
 I will catch you, I'll be waiting I'm sorry he lost his job, but Bennet is not my problem anymore. 
 The thing is, the job Larissa offered me? It was his. 
 Good for you. 
 I guess. 
 I feel so guilty. 
 Even though Bennet was out partying all the time, I did not want him to lose his job. 
 He was partying? Like with other guys? You know what? I don't care. 
 Well, it kinda seems like you do care. 
 I know how you must feel, Walt. 
 It's tough to be at a party like this and not be with the person you love. 
 
 
 
 I know you're trying, Carrie, but you don't know anything about what I'm going through. 
 Well, I know you're struggling with stuff, and I am, too. 
 I understand how hard it is to want to make your parents happy. 
 I'm going through the same thing with my dad, trying to figure out if I should go to college - or take the job. 
 Are you kidding me? Are you really comparing your situation with mine? Boo-hoo, you don't get to dance with your amazing boyfriend at prom when you have a lifetime to dance with him. 
 And boo-hoo, your dad might be mad at you for a minute if you don't go to college. 
 We both know that in five years you'll be married with kids living in the suburbs, and none of this will matter, while I, on the other hand I have to keep living a lie so that the world accepts me. 
 Shane, buddy, these designs you did are amazing. 
 But I wish I'd been there to help you present 'em. 
 I know, dude. 
 We're partners and it sucks you can't be around when we're digging into the creative. 
 I know. 
 The time difference thing is rough. 
 I'm gonna miss the vendor meeting next week, too, huh? Unless you can come out to Cali, yeah. 
 It's nonstop out there. 
 This is getting real. 
 I think we need some more office space, because my parents' garage is not hacking it anymore. 
 We can get someplace small. 
 Maybe in Malibu? A view of the break at surfrider? I miss that. 
 The one thing I really liked about my time there with my dad, the sound of the ocean. 
 So come back out, man, even if it's just for the summer. 
 Be hands on, see your investment grow. 
 We do get more done working face-to-face in an hour than a week's worth of phone calls. 
 Right on. 
 And you need to be living the lifestyle in order to sell it. 
 The thing is, I have Carrie here. 
 Then she can come, too. 
 I could totally see that little Betty on a board. 
 One more coat of frosted lip gloss, and I'll be ready for the inevitable announcement that I'm prom queen. 
 You don't exactly look like a prom queen-to-be. 
 I don't? Why? Is a boob uneven? No, I mean You don't look happy. 
 Oh, that. 
 It's just, my date is Pendleton. 
 Not exactly queen consort material. 
 Didn't you get asked by every captain of every sports team? Including girls softball? Yeah, but I've dated everyone important already. 
 I don't do repeats. 
 So Pendleton it is. 
 I need a new batch of men. 
 Which you will have at Columbia. 
 Shh! Someone might hear you. 
 God forbid someone knows you're a brainiac. 
 Look, I worked really hard pretending to be dumb so I could be prom queen. 
 And so I wouldn't end up in classes with losers and pasty social rejects. 
 The way I played it, I ended up in classes with jocks and pretty boys. 
 Just the men I wanted to date. 
 You're kind of an evil genius. 
 Yes, I am. 
 And because everyone I hang out with are dummies, they never figured it out. 
 Those Jens are such Ding-Dongs! Mm? You coming to see my big moment? Did she just call us Ding-Dongs? Ding-dong. 
 That bitch is dead. 
 I always wanted that here at this hotel. 
 A traditional wedding with a cake and a band. 
 Which is why I didn't wanna come here. 
 Yet another reminder of what I can't have. 
 Maybe you can't have the wedding, but you can have authentic love. 
 You already did have it with Bennet. 
 And you shouldn't have to choose between that and your parents. 
 You deserve both. 
 But this life Being gay? I don't know if I can handle it. 
 It's not fair, Walt that people don't wanna recognize your relationship because it doesn't look like what they know. 
 It sucks. 
 But is it gonna be any easier for you to deny who you are and hide from your feelings? Real connections? I'll be right back. 
 Okay? Where are you going? To be authentic. 
 Prom Short for the word âpromenade,â a tradition when couples walk into a ballroom, two by two. 
 But that wasn't my prom. 
 It was just me And my ex-boyfriend. 
 Hi and bye. 
 Carrie, wait, uh, please. 
 Look, I've been I've been practicing what I wanted to say to you if I ever got to see you again, but Please, let me let me have a do-over. 
 Um Hi. 
 Hi. 
 My apology is gonna be really long, do you do you wanna sit? I'm fine standing. 
 Don't say I didn't warn you. 
 By the way, why are you here dressed as a vision? I'm here for my prom. 
 Ah. 
 And, um, who are you here with? It's a long story, but I'm here with friends. 
 So, no boyfriend? That's part of the long story. 
 Uh, no boyfriend here, but I am back with Sebastian. 
 I-I assumed as much. 
 But boyfriend or no boyfriend, I-I need you to know, that play that I said I was writing about you, I never wrote it. 
 I was never even planning on writing it. 
 I just said it I just said it to hurt you. 
 Because selfishly, I wanted you to feel what I was feeling. 
 It's no excuse, but I I lashed out because I've never been so hurt before. 
 Wow. 
 That was a really good apology. 
 So the practiced part I'm done with. 
 Wanting to talk to you? Never. 
 You always were wonderful with words. 
 So prom, huh? Yeah. 
 The school year's pretty much over. 
 Oh, yeah, where'd you decide to go to college? Um, N. 
 Y. 
 U. 
 , I think. 
 But I thought I thought it was your first choice? It was, but then Larissa offered me a job at âInterviewâ Magazine. 
 That's fantastic. 
 When do you start? Uh, well, I-I don't think I'm gonna take it. 
 I feel like I need to go to college. 
 You're a writer. 
 You don't need school. 
 You you need life experiences. 
 To walk down the streets of this amazing and beautiful city and take it all in. 
 Hey. 
 I'm I'm so happy you called. 
 I'm so happy you came. 
 How are you? Good actually. 
 Really good. 
 Good. 
 How are you? Okay. 
 It's been a hard few months. 
 I'm sorry, Walt. 
 Me, too. 
 And everything's really okay with you? I was worried because I heard you got fired. 
 And were maybe partying a lot. 
 Carrie told you I, uh, went off the deep end a bit, huh? She did. 
 And she feels terrible about getting you fired. 
 Actually, it was the best thing for me. 
 I realized I didn't even wanna be at âInterviewâ anymore. 
 It was just something I fell into. 
 I I wasn't even enjoying it. 
 And since then, I found what I really wanna be doing with my life. 
 What? Ascot model? There's always that. 
 No, I started volunteering at gay men's health crisis, and a job opened up a few weeks ago. 
 I'm now working there full-time. 
 That's great. 
 I've missed you. 
 Not as much as I've missed you. 
 Well, I should, um, get back in there. 
 Yeah, and I should probably get back to drinks with my producer. 
 Probably thinks I got lost in the bathroom. 
 Take the job. 
 You were born to write. 
 Thank you. 
 It's really good to see you, Carrie. 
 Yeah, it was good to see you, too. 
 There was a time when everybody said we were going down and I, I felt so alone Bennet, I am so sorry. 
 No, I'm sorry. 
 No, I'm the sorriest! Hey, where have you guys been? You totally bailed on me. 
 So much for choosing your friends over a guy. 
 We're sorry. 
 Eh, it's okay. 
 Dorrit gave me spiked punch. 
 I am a terrible date, Maggie, really. 
 But I have Someone I want you to meet. 
 This is my boyfriend, Bennet. 
 Oh, my God. 
 Oh, my God! Oh! Finally I get to meet you. 
 I'm the ex-girlfriend, you know. 
 Oh, I know. 
 You really do have legs up to here. 
 Walt said that? Punch? Oh, I think we're gonna get along just fine. 
 Gather around as we crown our queen of queens. 
 Oh! Let's go watch Donna's coronation. 
 Yay. 
 Your Class of 1986 Prom Queen is Donna Ladonna! Give me that tiara! What?! Secret nerd! What are you doing? Don't mess with the hair. 
 You don't get to be prom queen based on a lie. 
 What the hell is going on? Did you know that she is smart? She isn't one of us. 
 She got into Columbia. 
 That cannot be true. 
 All this time she acted like she was interested in partying and being cool, she was actually laughing at us behind our backs. 
 And studying! I wasn't. 
 I swear. 
 I just got lucky on a few tests. 
 Okay, that is it. 
 It is a sad state of affairs that smart people, especially beautiful young women, are made to feel ashamed of their intellectual prowess when they should be celebrated! What is Mouse doing? - She's destroying Donna - By accident. 
 Did Mouse just say âSandra Day O'Connorâ? Sit down, nerd! We need to do something to help Donna, because she helped me when I was almost outed. 
 Okay. 
 That's it. 
 I'm gonna go butch. 
 What are you talking about? Nobody will believe that. 
 Hey! Nobody messes with my girl. 
 Who are you? And I stand corrected. 
 I'm a senior at U. 
 N. 
 L. 
 V. 
 , that's who. 
 And Donna's my, uh, my broad. 
 My dame. 
 Oh, God. 
 It's like he's in âGuys And Dollsâ" wait a minute. 
 Who's this college guy? I thought I was your date. 
 Y-you are. 
 Well, then, back off, buddy. 
 Oh. 
 Right. 
 Thank you. 
 Donna I-I don't care that you're smart or if you study or if you got into some fancy college. 
 You still have the sweetest rack in the entire school. 
 And that is the only thing that matters. 
 Donna This is for you. 
 Pendy, that is the sweetest thing anyone's ever said to me. 
 Oh! I give up. 
 Somebody punch me. 
 People My subjects, thank you for this greatly deserved honor. 
 As Christie Brinkley's husband sang, this is the time to remember. 
 And by that I mean, remember this. 
 Did she just quote Billy Joel? Yes. 
 And she's not wrong. 
 This is the time to remember. 
 It certainly is. 
 Cheers. 
 This wasn't the most traditional way to go, but it was the prom we were meant to have. 
 they're tearing it down now but it's just as well And as I went out to find my limo, I ended up finding my date. 
 so stay with me, baby What's a bad boy like you doing outside a place like this? Thought you might want an escort home. 
 Now that I see how beautiful you look, I'm even more sorry that I couldn't be here with you. 
 You look kind of beautiful, yourself. 
 This old thing? Yeah, everything else was dirty. 
 So tell me everything. 
 How was your night? Very eventful. 
 For all of us. 
 I decided to take the job at âInterview. 
 â Yeah? Good. 
 That's awesome. 
 Yeah, it is. 
 It's awesome. 
 You seem totally confident about your decision. 
 What made you see things so clearly? I guess I just needed more time to think about it. 
 And then all my thoughts came together. 
 That's great, Bradshaw. 
 The scary part now is, how am I gonna tell my dad? Well, let's worry about that tomorrow. 
 For now, let's just walk. 
 This is the time The two of us, like a promenade. 
 'Cause it will not last forever these are the days to hold on to 'cause we won't, although we'll want to this is the time So how was prom? Oh. 
 Hi. 
 You you scared me. 
 Um, it was great. 
 Yeah, it was a great night. 
 Time to remember, really. 
 Mm, like that Billy Joel song. 
 Exactly. 
 Is everything okay? Um Dad, we need to talk. 
 While I was about to tell my father about my new job in the city, Sebastian was trying to figure out if he could stay in it. 
 Hey! Excuse me. 
 It's after 9:00 A. 
 M. 
 Your dog shouldn't be off leash. 
 And while one man was trying to find his freedom, another was escaping his own prison. 
 How was the prom, dear? - It was fun. 
 Wonderful. 
 Those traditions are such important ones. 
 Yeah, they are. 
 But they're not the only things that are important. 
 Like being true to one's self. 
 Can you stop reading your papers, please? Here's the thing I've been living the way you want me to live the last three months, and I've been dying inside. 
 Walt, don't be dramatic. 
 I haven't even had my second cup of coffee. 
 I'm not being dramatic. 
 I'm being me. 
 I can't keep pretending to be someone I'm not. 
 I'm gay. 
 If you can't accept that, I understand. 
 I also understand if you'd like me to move out. 
 It's your house, so it's up to you. 
 But how I live my life is up to me. 
 You can go back to your papers now. 
 So let me understand this. 
 You are throwing away college, throwing away your future, so that you can take some job at âInterviewâ Magazine? I'm not throwing away my future. 
 My future is writing. 
 I'm just getting there sooner than we had planned. 
 Why are you in such a hurry? Dad, this is a huge opportunity. 
 People with college degrees on their rÃ©sumÃ©s are trying to get the job that I was offered. 
 What about the next job? What will you tell those employers when they ask you where you went to college? Well, I'll tell them I started working instead, that I got real world experience. 
 Ah, but college sets you up to be able to handle that real world experience. 
 And the fact that you are being so impetuous and irresponsible tells me you're not even close to being ready. 
 You're still just a kid. 
 I'm 18, dad. 
 Well, oh, then you must have all the answers. 
 So let me ask you this, do you plan to continue to still be on my health insurance? Or does your job provide benefits? What's your salary? You get overtime? I-I don't know about any of those things yet. 
 Okay, all right. 
 Uh, do you even have a contract? Can you get fired without severance? And if you do, what will you do then? Well, I don't know, but I guess I'll figure it out. 
 What do you know?! I know that I've made up my mind. 
 I'm taking the job! I've allowed you to have everything that you wanted The internship at the Magazine, the classes at the new school, N. 
 Y. 
 U. 
 And I appreciate all that. 
 Then why are you doing this to me?! This isn't about you. 
 This is about me, and I am not you. 
 I never have been. 
 We don't want the same things for me. 
 All I want for you is to be safe and stable and to have opportunites and you are throwing it all away on a whim. 
 Well, I'm sorry you feel that way, dad. 
 I really am. 
 But not sorry enough that you'll go to college? No. 
 You wanna be an adult? Great. 
 Be an adult. 
 No more credit cards from me. 
 You don't come home to do your laundry. 
 No more allowance. 
 No more buying you clothing. 
 I will not subsidize your life unless you are going to college. 
 You will be on your own. 
 Got it? I'm all yours. 
 I'm taking the job. 
 Oh, how delightful! Carrie, I am thrilled. 
 Yeah, me, too. 
 Um, I just have a couple questions about my salary and insurance and stuff. 
 Oh, darling. 
 Human resources deals with l those boring details. 
 You'll have to pop down and speak to someone there. 
 Right now the most important thing for me to do is to go and find some champagne so we can celebrate! I had officially entered the grown-up world of publishing, where champagne was the answer to all my questions. 
 Yeah! Pendy! Look at this photo. 
 I think we have a real shot at being in the yearbook next year. 
 Wait, you're being serious? You really like that photo of us? How could I not? Look at that smile. 
 I'm sorry, so the whole time we were hating the prom, you were actually loving it. 
 Was the whole making fun of it thing just a way to get me to go with you? Yeah. 
 Why would you do that? Because you've been jerking me around for months, using me to get back at your dad. 
 But I like you, Dorrit. 
 A lot. 
 And I wanted to go to my junior prom with you. 
 So, yeah. 
 I tricked you. 
 And by the way, I know you had fun. 
 So don't even try to deny it. 
 But what you did was so devious and manipulative. 
 Can't believe you would have the gall to trick me like that. 
 Oh, I have huge gall. 
 And you should remember that. 
 You're a little bit of a snake. 
 Maybe you're not too nice for me, after all. 
 Maybe you're actually kind of worthy of me. 
 Smart girl for finally seeing that. 
 P. 
 D. 
 A. 
 ? Really? I don't know. 
 Someone might see. 
 Shut up and be my boyfriend already. 
 Don't worry. 
 I'm almost finished packing. 
 You won't have to force me out. 
 No, no, no. 
 I'm I'm I'm not here to tell you to leave. 
 Look, I just always thought that you'd you'd follow tradition. 
 You'd go to Dartmouth, you'd join my fraternity, but I heard you. 
 Your life is it's your life. 
 It won't look like my life, but I get that. 
 I want you to have this ring, even if you decide not to go to Dartmouth. 
 Because you're my legacy, and I'm proud of that. 
 Thank you. 
 We walked on the beach Now let me help you unpack this stuff, yeah? that old hotel They're tearin' it down now Sometimes you can break free from tradition and live the life you want by staying put. 
 And other times, in order to find the right kind of life for yourself, you have to leave. 
 So what made you change your mind? I don't know. 
 I guess I just saw Carrie go for it and I realized, what am I doing? It shouldn't even be a question. 
 I need to follow my dreams, too. 
 That's right. 
 I'm going to California. 
 And I'm gonna tell Carrie today so she can make some plans to come visit. 
 She's gonna love it. 
 Yeah, I hope so. 
 These are the days to hold on to 'cause we won't, although we'll want to this is the time but time is gonna change I'm sorry. 
 It sounds like it got pretty intense between you and your dad. 
 Yeah, it did. 
 Hey! Come on, Ollie. 
 No. 
 You sure you wanna keep him? This dog and the city don't go together. 
 The city doesn't go with a lot of things, but I'm sure I'm keeping him. 
 Well, he is cute. 
 And it's nice to be able to walk with you, have you by my side. 
 Same. 
 I hope it doesn't scare you, how much I need you. 
 What are you talking about? I feel like you're all I have. 
 That's crazy. 
 You you have your friends, your family. 
 My friends are all heading off to college. 
 And my dad you should've seen him. 
 He basically cut me out for good. 
 I know your dad. 
 He'll come around. 
 I'm not so sure this time. 
 Hey, it'll be okay, one way or the other. 
 I promise. 
 If you weren't here, I don't know what I'd do. 
 Thank you for being here for me. 
 Hey, of course. 
 Always. 
 You've given me the best of you but now I need the rest of you
