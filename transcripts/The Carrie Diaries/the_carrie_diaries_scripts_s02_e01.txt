 (Carrie) Before there was s*x Before there was the city, there was just me, Carrie Carrie Bradshaw in Castlebury, Connecticut. 
 What about an internship in Manhattan? Manhattan? Aah! No way! Come work for me at "Interview"" you would be fantastic. 
 (Carrie) I am in love with Sebastian Kydd. 
 Walt was never gonna love you in any real way. 
 I don't understand. 
 I don't think Walt likes girls. 
 Are you gay? Maggs, don't do this. 
 I wanna go to the prom with my hot geek boyfriend. 
 Is this for me? I wanted it to be perfect for us. 
 Here's to two loose-lipped losers who created their own messes. 
 We've been friends for a long time. 
 That means something. 
 Maybe all it means is that it's been a long time, because it certainly doesn't mean you're a good friend. 
 Larissa will be going to Kyoto for part of the summer and said I could stay in her loft. 
 You living alone in New York would be a big deal. 
 I wouldn't be alone. 
 I have Walt. 
 Hey, Dorrit. 
 Carrie's not home. 
 I don't know what's going on with you two, - but you'll work it out. 
 I'm not so sure. 
 Originally Aired October 25, 2013 (Dead or Alive's "You Spin Me Round (Like A Record)" playing) In life, we care about winning You're not gonna beat me. 
 (Click) I just did. 
 (Inhales sharply) Checkmate. 
 If I I get to know your name you lose. 
 Because losing sucks Could trace your private number Especially if it means losing your boyfriend and your oldest friend. 
 (Gasping) all I know is that to me you look like you're having fun open up your lovin' arms the sting of defeat is made a little easier by a great place to live You spin me right round, baby, right round like a record, baby right round, round, round you spin me right round, baby A great summer job Like a record, baby, right round, round, round An awesome new look You look like you're lots of fun And a whole new attitude. 
 Watch out, here I come you spin me right round, baby, right round like a record, baby, right round, round, round (Camera shutter clicks) (Walt) Carrie? (Switch clicks) (Singsongy) Carrie. 
 (Moans) Why are you waking me up so early? It's not early. 
 It's noon. 
 Oh, crap. 
 I'm so late for work. 
 Um, it's Saturday. 
 So why did you wake me? Because you promised your dad you'd go home this weekend. 
 Well, I don't wanna go. 
 See, this is why I'm happy that my parents are on the cape. 
 I don't have to go home and answer 20 questions until at least August. 
 Or bump into half the town of Castlebury while picking up takeout. 
 Or wonder if the whole town is talking about you behind your back. 
 Or laughing about how your boyfriend kissed your best friend. 
 Or snickering that maybe you're gay. 
 Although Donna did seem to squash that one by telling everybody that we were having mad s*x again, and Maggie was pissed. 
 Whatever Donna says is gospel in that town. 
 True. 
 (Sighs) So has she been regaling you with tales of summer scandals - while you've been living here? - Of course. 
 She lives for it. 
 Has anything interesting been going on with anyone? You mean with Sebastian? Am I that obvious? (Swallows) You're that human. 
 I'm such a loser. 
 Look, he is in lame-o Castlebury, and you're here with the coolest job, going to the coolest parties. 
 You win. 
 You're the winning est. 
 Okay. 
 What are you not telling me? What do you mean? You're trying way too hard to make me feel better. 
 (Sighs) Donna may have told me that Maggie got a job at the country club. 
 (Loverboy's "Working For The Weekend" playing) Okay, here are your virgin strawberry daiquiris. 
 Everyone's looking at you one for you. 
 And one for you. 
 Okay. 
 Could you be a doll and get me a yellow umbrella for my drink? - Why? - So it matches my outfit. 
 You know what? I want a pink one for mine. 
 Green for me. 
 Everybody's working Ha. 
 Well, well, look who it is. 
 The greatest abs in town. 
 Everybody's wants a new romance - Whatever. 
 He's not all that. 
 It's funny. 
 He barely comes to the club since you started working here. 
 Guess he doesn't think you're so great, either. 
 It has nothing to do with me. 
 Oh, please. 
 You blew up his relationship with "The Living Doll. 
 " So he hates you now. 
 You better start from the start Takes two to tango. 
 (Scoffs) Not when you're leading. 
 You just drag the poor soul along for the ride. 
 And don't forget my umbrella. 
 Yellow! - Hey. 
 Hey. 
 How's everything? You need a drink? All good. 
 Probably better if you don't hang here too long. 
 We're just talking. 
 In front of the whole town. 
 Things will get back to Carrie. 
 Don't want her to get the wrong idea. 
 And what idea would that be? That there could ever be something going on between us. 
 Oh, please. 
 We just kissed that one time. 
 It was nothing. 
 Yeah, tell that to her. 
 I did. 
 I've apologized to Carrie, like, a hundred times. 
 She won't hear me out. 
 You guys weren't even together when it happened. 
 You don't get it, do you? She trusted us. 
 I lost her because of this, because of what we did. 
 She was my best friend since kindergarten, and now that's over. 
 Well, it's not over for me. 
 Come on, baby, let's go it doesn't feel like work. 
 I mean, it is. 
 It's challenging, but it's fun. 
 Have you met Andy Warhol yet? - No. 
 He's like Charlie from "Charlie's Angels" All powerful but we never see him. 
 (Chuckles) That does make you Sabrina? I know you think she isn't pretty, but I like her. 
 She's the smart one. 
 No, I'm more like the receptionist you never see outside of Bosley's office. 
 I'm too low on the totem pole to even talk to him on speakerphone. 
 I'm sure it's just a matter of time. 
 You've taken to Manhattan like a duck to water. 
 Yeah. 
 I guess I have. 
 (Scoffs) H & H Bagels and lox from Zabar's? I'd say you've learned what's important. 
 And you've, uh, been Making friends? Um, ew. 
 Are you trying to ask Carrie about guys? Gross. 
 I'm gonna have to agree. 
 It's kinda creepy. 
 Oh, great, 'cause I really don't wanna talk about that stuff anyway. 
 I mean, not that I wanna seem disinterested. 
 It's cool, dad. 
 I know you care. 
 For the record, there's no one. 
 (Whispers) Oh, thank God. 
 (Telephone rings) I'll get it. 
 Just glad I don't have to worry about Dorrit dating. 
 You don't know about Miller? (Mouth full) Who's Miller? (Laughing) How could he not have known that Dorrit has a boyfriend? Well, apparently, "in love" Dorrit is just as sullen with my dad as she always is. 
 Wait. 
 Is he fuming? He must be fuming. 
 I told him to be careful how he handles it, because whatever he wants her to do, she'll do the exact opposite. 
 I mean, all my dad wants to do is meet Miller. 
 Well, meeting parents can be rough. 
 But not for you. 
 Nope. 
 They've been shockingly okay. 
 My G. 
 P. 
 A. 
 improved, and I added some extracurriculars, so they think West is good for me. 
 So you've been having a good summer? Totally. 
 We've been taking S. 
 A. 
 T. 
 prep classes and A. 
 P. 
 calculus to beef up our course load. 
 Yeah. 
 Sounds awesome. 
 Are you doing anything fun? That is fun. 
 But I refuse to go to the country club now that that skank Maggie is working there. 
 You don't have to do that for me, Mouse. 
 But what she did to you and Walt was awful. 
 Not gonna forgive her and not going to the country club and risk seeing her, even if it means I have to miss the 4th of July Barbecue. 
 Oh, but you love going to that. 
 You should go. 
 Take West with you. 
 I do love the fireworks and the red, white, and blue sparkler sheet cake. 
 So go. 
 Maybe we will, but I'm ignoring that tart. 
 You wanna come with us? I think I'll pass. 
 There are a few people I'm trying to avoid, and it's not just Maggie. 
 You're gonna have to see Sebastian someday, Carrie. 
 He hurt you. 
 It doesn't mean he doesn't regret it. 
 Well, I don't have time for regrets, only fun. 
 I have to get back to the city. 
 Come on. 
 (The Go-Go's "Can't Stop The World" playing) What do you think Donna's cousin is like? He's a bouncer, right? Mm-hmm. 
 I'm hoping hot and beefy. 
 (Chuckles) You make him sound like a hot dog. 
 I thought you were all into Bennett. 
 I am, but since I'm not 18 yet, and I have a pulse, I'm allowed to look at other people. 
 Fair enough. 
 Just wondering where you guys stood. 
 (Sighs) I really like him. 
 And he's flirty, but it just feels like we're in nowhere's land until I'm legal. 
 It's annoying. 
 You sure you wanna move your queen there? No. 
 Aren't I protecting my knight? Yeah, but you just left your king vulnerable. 
 You should have given up your queen. 
 I don't get this game. 
 Sometimes you have to sacrifice something valuable in order to win. 
 How did you figure all this out? Sebastian and I used to play. 
 He's amazing. 
 It was always like he could see three moves ahead. 
 So he's a player. 
 You said it. 
 (Door buzzing) (Chuckles) - I didn't mean it that way. 
 It's fine. 
 And you're not bummed we're going out with Donna tonight? What? No. 
 Um, she's been a great friend to you, and I wanna try someplace new. 
 I feel like we always go to the same three places Limelight, Area, and Danceteria. 
 Well, we could do worse. 
 The hottest clubs in town, those magic faxes you have in your purse. 
 I do enjoy having all access to all the coolest clubs, but it'll be fun to mix it up. 
 And we're going with Donna, so there's bound to be drama. 
 (Donna) Yoo-hoo! I brought wine coolers! Why let it stop you Oh. 
 Oh, yeah, and Sebastian. 
 Can't stop the world can't stop the world Your drink, madame. 
 I hope she's not upset that I brought him. 
 What? I don't do public transportation, and he drives a Porsche. 
 This'll be fun. 
 Or a total disaster. 
 I hope it's okay I came. 
 Oh, yeah, of course. 
 I mean, sure. 
 Who wouldn't wanna be in Manhattan over Castlebury, anyway? I totally get it. 
 I came to see you. 
 (Keys jangle) Oh. 
 Since you wouldn't see me, and then you kinda just disappeared. 
 Uh, I didn't disappear. 
 I just have a life here in the city this summer. 
 (Paper rustling) You changed your hair. 
 Yeah. 
 Yeah. 
 Well A lot's changed since I last saw you. 
 I can see that. 
 Hey, can we talk? Uh, you know, I would love to, but I-I really gotta get going. 
 Oh. 
 You're not going out with us? Can't. 
 What do you mean? I thought we were all going to Donna's I, uh, I have to go to Area. 
 I haven't been in ages, and, well, everyone from the magazine is expecting me, so, um, you guys do your thing, and, um, maybe we'll meet up later. 
 Sounds good. 
 Have fun! I love being the only girl. 
 Carrie, wait. 
 If you change your mind, just meet up with us, okay? Donna's cousin's bar is right around the corner from the loft, so you know where to find us. 
 I won't change my mind. 
 Do you want company? Are you kidding? I'm supes excited to be heading out on my own tonight. 
 Have fun. 
 (Door closes) Well, that went well. 
 Is she ever gonna talk to me? She just did. 
 Carrie's got a big social calendar. 
 Yeah, apparently. 
 Okay, there's no way I'm gonna waste my night being all boo-hooey about yesterday's news, so let's get our buzz on and have fun. 
 (Sighs) Ah. 
 Hey there. 
 So what are you up to tonight? Going to Audrey's. 
 Probably gonna sleep there. 
 Great. 
 Sounds great. 
 Hey, you don't mind if I, uh, call Audrey's mom just to make sure it's okay, do you? Do whatever you want. 
 (Receiver clicks) (Dials) Hi. 
 This is, uh, Tom Bradshaw. 
 I'd like to speak with Monica, please. 
 Audrey's going to get her mother. 
 That's nice. 
 Hey, Monica, it's Tom Bradshaw. 
 How are ya? Great, great. 
 Listen, I just wanna make sure it was okay if Dorrit stayed over. 
 Uh, she's been over there the last few weeks quite a bit, and I just wouldn't want you to feel like she'd overstayed her welcome. 
 Great. 
 Okay, well, I'm I'm glad you feel that way. 
 She'll see you soon. 
 (Hangs up receiver) So Audrey's mom is happy to have you. 
 Whatever. 
 Why do you even care all of a sudden? No. 
 I (Sighs) I know that you've been seeing a boy. 
 Ugh. 
 Why does Carrie have to be such a blabbermouth? She assumed that I knew, Dorrit, which apparently I should have. 
 If you're going steady with someone, then I should meet him. 
 No way. 
 The fact that you even said the word "steady" means you're too big of a geek to meet him. 
 Dorrit, I'm not trying to be cool. 
 I'm trying to be your dad. 
 And it wasn't a request. 
 If you wanna keep seeing this Miller fellow, then I need to meet him. 
 Fine. 
 (Keys jangle) You coming? Where? I'm driving you to Audrey's. 
 I wouldn't want you to have to walk there. 
 Fine. 
 I need to get my stuff. 
 I'll meet you at the car. 
 (Pages rustle) (Dials) (Telephone rings) Hello. 
 We're screwed. 
 What happened? My dad knows about you. 
 He wants to meet you. 
 Well, I wanna get to know your family. 
 Trust me, you don't. 
 All this means is we'll never be alone ever again. 
 He'll be all over us. 
 I have to go. 
 Where? I told my dad I had a sleepover at Audrey's. 
 Luckily, Audrey's as good at lying as I am, and impersonating her mother. 
 But now I'm stuck at her house all night. 
 (Horn honks) And now he's waiting in the car. 
 See? Already all over me. 
 Call when I can. 
 (Hangs up receiver) (Brian Page's "The Key" playing) Right this way. 
 I love this party! I dream about the flag cake all year. 
 It's a cake shaped like an American flag, and it's huge. 
 Awesome. 
 I can't wait. 
 I'm so excited you get to see the fireworks with me. 
 They're legendary. 
 So I've heard. 
 Your waiter will be with you shortly. 
 Hopefully Maggie isn't working tonight. 
 Ahem. 
 Hi, Maggie. 
 So I'll be your server tonight. 
 (West) Great. 
 Great. 
 Can I get you guys some drinks while you look at the menus? We know what we want. 
 But I haven't even looked at the menu. 
 Chicken fingers. 
 Is that seriously all you're gonna say to me? With honey mustard. 
 Fine. 
 Wait. 
 (Paper rustles) I didn't order. 
 I may have lost my group that night Sorry, folks. 
 We're at capacity. 
 But I hadn't lost my new attitude. 
 Carrie Bradshaw. 
 I'm on the list. 
 (Man) You gonna let us know or what? Sorry. 
 Not on it. 
 Well, I-I faxed over my request earlier this week from "Interview" magazine. 
 Do you have a business card? I have even better The fax you sent me back, confirming that I was on the list. 
 Oh, it's in here somewhere. 
 Damn it. 
 (Indistinct conversations) Here. 
 Yeah. 
 (Chuckles) Here it is. 
 Uh, this is confirming Carrie Bradshaw plus one will be coming to Area on Friday. 
 See? There it is. 
 I see it. 
 Who's your plus one? (Indistinct conversations continue) She is. 
 See you, guys! What? My My my purse. 
 My My purse is gone. 
 My my Carrie purse. 
 Did you see someone pick it up? Someone My my purse. 
 My purse is gone. 
 It's gone. 
 My my Carrie purse is gone. 
 It just Someone stole my Carrie purse! It had everything. 
 It had everything My my my keys, my money, my my charge card. 
 I just I can't believe some jerk stole my purse. 
 Hey, hey, did you see someone walk by with a purse? It has "Carrie" on it. 
 Your bag is long gone. 
 No, no. 
 May-maybe someone picked it up by accident, and and and they're gonna return it. 
 It says "Carrie" on it, and my mom gave it to me. 
 It was hers. 
 Your mom's name is "Carrie"? No. 
 No, as you well know, that is my name. 
 Carrie. 
 Carrie Bradshaw. 
 The name I gave you. 
 The name that should have been on the list and wasn't, so I had to show you that stupid fax, and now my purse is stolen! My mom's purse. 
 I I loved that purse. 
 Was part of who I am. 
 Look, it sucks that your bag got stolen. 
 But I got a line that I have to manage. 
 So what do you wanna do? You wanna come in or not? While I was now between a rock and a hard place (Camera shutter clicks) (Loverboy) touch that dial my friends were partying at the place for rock 'n' roll. 
 Lovin' every minute of it lovin' every minute of it turn that dial all the way shoot me like a rocket into space Look at that guy. 
 This bar is weird. 
 I'm pretty sure that's Ric Ocasek from the Cars. 
 Well, I'm pretty sure he's wearing more makeup than I am. 
 This is like the bar for rockers. 
 You are so lucky your cousin works here. 
 Those two women need hair conditioner, STAT. 
 Oh, no. 
 Oh, no! (Sebastian) - What? - This place is a bust. 
 Way to branch out. 
 I'm drinking a beer, aren't I? I know what I like, and it's not here. 
 Well, we could go meet Carrie. 
 She's at Area, and there are plenty of douchey stockbroker types there. 
 Whoa, oh, whoa, whoa what? It's true. 
 They hang out there. 
 Not real sure Carrie would appreciate me crashing her party. 
 She made that pretty clear. 
 She may have exaggerated her plans for the night. 
 What do you mean? Oldest trick in the book make it seem like you have way better plans than the person who dumped you. 
 I didn't dump her. 
 Oh, fine. 
 Cheated on, whatever. 
 If there are gonna be hot preppies, I say we go. 
 Lovin' every minute of it I don't know. 
 Carrie just wanted to make it seem like she had a lot going on. 
 That's insane. 
 She doesn't have anything to prove to me. 
 Blah, blah, blah. 
 So bored. 
 While we're here moping, Carrie's probably having the night of her life. 
 Ow. 
 Ow, ow, ow, ow. 
 Ow. 
 (Siren wailing in distance) Ow. 
 I can't believe we have to have Maggie as our waitress. 
 Come on. 
 This is your favorite night of the summer. 
 Forget Maggie. 
 You're right. 
 I just wish I didn't have to see her. 
 Let me know if you need anything else. 
 Where's our waitress? That girl Maggie. 
 Oh. 
 She asked to switch tables or something. 
 I'm not really sure. 
 Oh. 
 She did, did she? Is everything okay? Everything is great. 
 Thank you. 
 This is a good thing. 
 She is just rude! You don't wanna be around her. 
 You just said that. 
 And I'm pretty sure she sensed that. 
 No. 
 That's not what she's doing. 
 She's icing me out. 
 Isn't that what you're doing to her? Yeah, but that's because she's in the wrong. 
 I'm not. 
 She's the bad friend. 
 I'm not. 
 She should be kissing my ass. 
 (Sighs) How dare she switch tables. 
 (Doorbell rings) Can I help you? Hi, sir. 
 I hope it's not too late to stop by. 
 I'm Dorrit's boyfriend, Miller. 
 Excuse me. 
 Excuse me. 
 (Man) Hey. 
 What are you looking at? You never seen anyone sweaty before? Jeez. 
 Excuse me. 
 Never come back. 
 (Man) You know, we're all waiting in line. 
 Oh. 
 Can I help you? You seem awfully eager to get in. 
 Excuse me. 
 Yeah, that would be an understatement. 
 Well, I don't like people who cut the line. 
 I believe in democracy. 
 Look, I'm kind of in a crisis, and I just need to get in there and see my friends. 
 So do all those people who are waiting patiently. 
 Look, I didn't want to have to do this, but if you don't let me in, I'm gonna have to tell Sam you were rude to me. 
 Oh, really? Sam who? Sam Jones. 
 So either get out of my way, or he's gonna hear all about this. 
 Do you understand? Oh, I understand. 
 And Sam heard everything Because I'm Sam Jones. 
 And P. 
 S. 
 I prefer "Samantha." 
 You're Sam? I-I mean, Samantha? I just assumed when Donna said her cousin was a bouncer, that Sam was a guy. 
 Wait. 
 You know Donna? And I prefer the term "Keeper of the Cool" to "Bouncer."  
 Right. 
 Sure. 
 Of course. 
 Uh, "Keeper of the Cool" look, I'm not usually this rude. 
 I-I just I lost my purse. Well, I didn't actually lose it. It was stolen, and I just I don't have any keys or money, so I had to walk 40 blocks to get here, and I just need to get inside and see my friends so I can get my keys and go home. 
 Why didn't you say you were a friend of Donna's? I would've let you right in. 
 Family trumps democracy any day. 
 Thank you. 
 Thanks so much. 
 Except Donna and your friends are gone. 
 What? What do you mean, gone?  
 Left. Ditched this place. Moved on to greener pastures. 
 (Chuckles) You Manhattanites are like sharks. 
 Always gotta keep movin'. 
 That's why I love this place. 
 I found my people. 
 Do you know where they went? 
 No idea. 
 Why don't you go inside? Have a drink. Have some fun. 
 Can't. It's a long story. 
 Yeah. 
 I don't do long stories or sob stories. 
 Well, in that case, you won't wanna hear mine, but would you mind go in and use the phone? 
 Sure. And have a drink on me while you're at it. 
 Thanks. 
 
 
 
 Look at her. 
 (Indistinct conversations) All flirty and flitting around. 
 She's taking their order. 
 Please. 
 She doesn't have to be all laughing and smiley. 
 (Whispers) She's a waitress, for God sakes. 
 All right. 
 I'll be right back with that, boys. 
 Thanks. 
 Excuse me! Waitress! Excuse me! - Leave it alone, Mouse. 
 Miss. 
 Miss! - What do you want? I want you to admit that you did something totally crappy to Carrie and to Walt. 
 I did admit it. 
 I have apologized, like, a thousand times. 
 You don't think I feel awful about what I did? I can't make her forgive me, and I'm sorry, but what Walt did to me sucked. 
 Why is it always about you? It's never it's never about me. 
 "Poor Carrie. 
 Poor Walt"" nobody ever cares about me or what I'm going through. 
 You do that enough for all of us. 
 Do not. 
 Do too! - What is this, the third grade? Wasn't that the year you kissed Jamie Bamberger? The boy I told you I liked? Ugh. 
 That was the fourth grade, and he kissed me. 
 You wish! You're just jealous 'cause he didn't like you. 
 He told everyone that you dumped him and that you kissed with way too much tongue! Oh, careful! Sparklers! Not the cake! Not the ca Not the cake! And the pool. 
 (Laughter) Is the cake okay?! (Laughter continues) (Walt) So how will we get in? I don't think it can be done without Carrie. 
 Excuse me. 
 Thank you. 
 Thank you. 
 Sorry. 
 Thank you. 
 We don't need Carrie when we have these. 
 We don't need those. 
 I got this. 
 Hi. 
 We're, uh, friends of Carrie bradshaw from "Interview" magazine, and she got here earlier, and e supposed to meet her, - but we got tied up and I think - Hey. 
 You know You weren't kidding when you said you got this. 
 Benjamin always ensures a warm welcome. 
 Hey. 
 You guys are going inside to look for that Carrie chick? Little? Blonde? Carrie Bradshaw? - Yeah. 
 Why? - She's not in there. 
 I'm sorry, but how would you know that? She's so tiny. 
 She barely makes an impression. 
 She did tonight. 
 Had her purse stolen right out here. 
 Wait. 
 Was she mugged? Is she okay? Where'd she go? She's fine. 
 She was just stupid enough to put her purse down on the street. 
 She's not stupid. 
 She's trusting. 
 Do you know where she went? Nope. 
 Just know she didn't have enough money for a cab. 
 She probably went back to Samantha's bar to look for us. 
 We should probably get back there. 
 You coming? How you doin'? You know what? I-I think I'll stay here. 
 Much more my speed. 
 Don't wait up! Boys? Boys! Let's go find Carrie. 
 I'm worried. 
 She's okay, Sebastian. 
 She knows how to take care of herself. 
 Yeah, I know that. 
 I just don't want her to have to. 
 No, you don't understand. 
 It was my mother's purse. 
 Yeah. 
 Ow. 
 Would it kill you to say "excuse me"? No. 
 No, I'm I'm sorry, officer. 
 I-I was talking to someone else. 
 Yes, I-I understand that you have a lot of other cases to handle, and No. 
 I-I didn't realize there are That's good to know. 
 Um but if I could just describe the purse to you again. 
 It's very important to me. 
 It had sentimental value. 
 (Click) What'd you do that for? I think I was finally getting somewhere. 
 Oh, Bambi. 
 You were getting nowhere fast. 
 My boss is getting pissed you're hogging the phone. 
 His drug dealer can't reach him if the line's busy. 
 (Hangs up receiver) - I'm sorry about that. 
 Don't worry. 
 Let's get you something to calm you down, huh? Maybe some tea. 
 Oh, yeah. 
 Tea would be lovely, thank you. 
 (The Outlets' "Bright Light"" playing) Here you go. 
 (Coughs) That is not tea. 
 Sure it is. 
 Long Island Iced Tea. 
 Well, is there any actual tea in it? Tea-quila. 
 (Chuckles) It's delish! And you could use some delish. 
 No, what I could use are some keys to my apartment. 
 You're not gonna stop with this whole "I need to go home" thing, are you? Probably not. 
 Okay. 
 If you promise no more boo-hooing, - I'll get you into your place. 
 You can do that? Just no more whining, okay? Promise me. 
 Yes. 
 I promise. 
 (Siren wailing in distance) You expect me to climb up the fire escape to break into my own apartment? You wanna break into someone else's? I'm game. 
 No. 
 Okay. 
 Let's get to it, then. 
 But it's like 20 feet up from here. 
 You promised no whining. 
 Are you crazy? Hmm. 
 Suddenly I was very worried she might be. 
 (Exhales) Just give me a little push. 
 You're too tiny. 
 Kinda using all I have here. 
 Oh, just a few more inches. 
 (Chuckles) That's what I always hope for. 
 If I had some, I'd give them to you. 
 Stop moving. 
 Ohh! Kinda wish you would warn me you weren't wearing any underwear. 
 I'm not wearing any underwear. 
 Yeah. 
 I know. 
 I can see that. 
 Oh! That's my face. 
 That's my face. 
 Uhh! (Groans) Ooh. 
 (Exhaling) Samantha. 
 Samantha, we have company. 
 Good. 
 Maybe they can help us. 
 No. 
 I don't think so. 
 Hello, officers. 
 Cops? (Sighs) Oh, jeez. 
 (Police radio chatter) Uhh! (Gasps) (Exhales deeply) (Lowered voice) - Say nothing. 
 What's the circus act about, ladies? Officers, I am so glad you are here. 
 I'm Carrie Bradshaw. 
 I called the precinct earlier, and no one listened to me. 
 No one. 
 I'm trying to get into my own apartment because my purse was stolen. 
 Wait. 
 Are you the chick who keeps calling precinct 37? Yes, yes, that's me. 
 Has there been any progress? Did you find my purse? (Mouths words) Your purse is gone, sweetheart. 
 Everyone's just been laughing about you. 
 Oh. 
 Well, I don't see how losing my dead mother's purse is so funny, but I guess having to crawl up a fire escape to get into my own apartment is just a hoot. 
 Oh, come on. 
 It's not that bad. 
 It's just a purse. 
 I wish that was the case. 
 Look (Chuckles) Bambi here has had a pretty rough night. 
 Any chance you big boys could give me a lift up to the fire escape so I could break her into her apartment? No one else should have to deal with her tonight. 
 She's pretty Emotional. 
 It's true, and I could just get worse, you know? There might even be tears. 
 (Sighs) So what do you say? You wanna give me a boost? (Door closes) (Tom) Dorrit? Dorrit, look who's here. 
 (Sighs) Hey. 
 Hey. 
 Hope it's okay I stopped by. 
 Sure. 
 I guess. 
 Kinda late. 
 Yeah. 
 I thought you were staying at Audrey's. 
 I was, until her stupid little brother short-sheeted the bed and glued together all the drawers. 
 All hell was breaking loose, so I figured it was better if I leave. 
 What are you doing here? He came by to see you. 
 Oh, really? Yeah, and when you weren't here, we got to talking. 
 About what? Music. 
 Me and your dad are both big Stones fans. 
 And Dylan. 
 Rockin'. 
 And we're big fans of your new look. 
 We both think you look so pretty with less makeup. 
 Oh, you do? - Yeah. 
 We really didn't talk about it that much. 
 (Chuckles) All right. 
 Well, I should probably head upstairs and give you kids some time alone. 
 Uh, but, Miller, you have to clear out by, uh, midnight. 
 Of course. 
 Okay? Really nice meeting you, Mr. 
 Bradshaw. 
 You, too. 
 (Whispers) What the hell is going on? - What do you mean? (Normal voice) - You knew I wasn't home. 
 I also knew that if I didn't meet your dad, he'd never let you out of the house again, so better to just get it over with. 
 That wasn't your call. 
 It was mine. 
 You need to stop being stubborn just to be stubborn. 
 Be smart about this. 
 It's kinda gross seeing you all chummy with my dad. 
 Yeah, but now look. 
 You and me all by ourselves. 
 I guess. 
 Come on. 
 Admit it. 
 I was right. 
 Don't push it. 
 I gotta ask, why are you helping me? You must be mad at me. 
 I kissed Maggie. 
 Yeah, so did I, and that's what got us into this whole mess. 
 You didn't betray Carrie. 
 I did. 
 But if I had been more honest with Maggie and more honest with myself, then Maggie never would have freaked out, and you and Carrie would still be together. 
 Yeah, I guess, but if I didn't tell Maggie I thought you were gay, we wouldn't be here either. 
 That's another way of looking at it. 
 I didn't tell her to make her mad. 
 I-I was trying to make her feel better about why it didn't work out with you guys. 
 I had no idea she would freak out. 
 (Chuckles) You don't know Maggie that well. 
 I guess I don't. 
 How did you know? Know what? That I was Gay? Yeah. 
 I think I just always kinda knew or assumed. 
 And you were okay with it. 
 Yeah. 
 Of course. 
 Why wouldn't I be? (Sighs) Thanks. 
 Nothing to thank me for. 
 (Whirring) I hope you're happy. 
 (Turns off blow dryer) That I'm in my golf clothes with soaking wet hair? Thrilled. 
 That I got fired. 
 Apparently, fighting with a member is frowned upon. 
 (Sighs) Please. 
 You only took this job so that you could hit on hot guys and drink free booze. 
 Okay, well, um, I didn't hate that part of the job, but I actually need the money. 
 For what? You don't get it, Mouse, do you? Your parents spend every waking minute making sure that you meet your goals, while mine don't even care if I have any. 
 I'm sure that's not true. 
 There is no money for me to go to college. 
 If I wanna go, I have to pay for it myself. 
 I didn't know. 
 I'm sorry. 
 It's why I took this job. 
 Do you want me to try to get you your job back? No, it's fine. 
 Money wasn't that good anyway. 
 Sure ain't gonna pay for four years of school. 
 Then maybe you can get a scholarship or something. 
 You've seen my grades, right? Or financial aid. 
 I could help you fill out the papers and stuff. 
 Maybe. 
 You'd do that? Of course, Maggie. 
 I just feel so lost. 
 Everybody hates me. 
 I don't hate you. 
 Thanks. 
 If I don't go to college, I'm stuck here. 
 You're going to college. 
 Don't worry. 
 I'll help you figure this out. 
 Thanks. 
 (Siren wailing in distance) (Sighs) Wow. 
 Nice place. 
 Oh. 
 Thanks. 
 I'm, uh You spoiled suburban kids sure have it good. 
 What, your dad pay for this or something? Actually, it's not mine. 
 My my friend's out of town. 
 I'm just crashing here. 
 So you're a mooch. 
 I could like you, Bambi. 
 Thank you? Well, your friend sure has a lot of crap. 
 This a chess set? (Chuckles) So pretentious. 
 She brought this back from France. 
 It's beautiful. 
 Who needs this much stuff? Everything I own, I could fit into a car A very small car. 
 And that's a good thing? - When you own things, you can be owned. 
 And those things can be stolen. 
 I just can't believe my purse is gone. 
 We all lose things Purses, shoes, your house. 
 Stuff comes. 
 Stuff goes. 
 Who cares? Hell, I was wearing underwear today when I got to the bar. 
 Now I'm not. 
 Yeah, our our trip up the fire escape made that very clear. 
 I really liked that underwear. 
 And I really liked my mom's purse. 
 I just always felt like I had a piece of her with me. 
 Sounds like your mom meant a lot to you. 
 Doesn't everybody's? (Sighs) Not everybody's. 
 Hey, you know that purse That ain't your mother, you know? It's just a purse. 
 I know. 
 I know. 
 I just hate that Sebastian threw me off my game. 
 If he hadn't have been here, I wouldn't have put my purse down on the street. 
 What kind of idiot puts their purse on the street? - Yeah, that is stupid. 
 Yeah. 
 But you know what's not stupid? Is showing him who came out on top that's a must. 
 That's what I think. 
 You know how you show a guy you've won? - By moving on. 
 Yes. 
 Exactly. 
 That's exactly what I told Walt. 
 So move on. 
 Well, if I knew how to do that, I would've by now. 
 Hook up with a hottie. 
 Does the trick every time. 
 Come on. 
 Let's go out and find you one. 
 Bar's crawling with them. 
 Maybe it was losing my purse or finding Samantha, but suddenly that idea sounded like a really good one. 
 You know what? I'm in. 
 Atta girl. 
 As I looked at myself in the mirror, I realized I wasn't over Sebastian. 
 And if I just went and hooked up with someone to prove something, then I truly would be a loser One who had lost herself. 
 And I may have lost my mother's purse and my boyfriend, but I still had me, and I was still my mother's daughter. 
 I'm sorry. 
 I can't go with you. 
 I'm still in love with Sebastian, and being with someone else isn't gonna change that. 
 You're in love with the guy. 
 Yeah, can't help you there. 
 Good luck with that. 
 Okay, well, if it's okay, I think I'm just gonna crash here. 
 I'm pretty exhausted. 
 Sure. 
 Of course. 
 I'm gonna head back to the bar. 
 You gonna be okay? I think so. 
 Hey, thanks for breaking me in. 
 Anytime. 
 Where are you going? Back the way I came. 
 You can just use the front door. 
 I like a little adventure. 
 You mean a near-death experience? You say "potato"" I say "po-tah-to"" and, Bambi? Yeah? Anytime you wanna stop by the bar, drinks on me. 
 Thanks. 
 And if you ever need anything, you know where I live. 
 (Chuckles) When you think about winning, it always seems so triumphant A big cheer goes up, fireworks, the big victory. 
 But sometimes those victories aren't an explosion at all. 
 Sometimes what we gain can be small (Crowd cheering) Like understanding what our friends are going through. 
 (Fireworks popping) Maggie, you're an employee. 
 You can't sit down with the members. 
 You're gonna get in trouble with the manager. 
 She's not an employee. 
 She's my friend. 
 (The Cure's "In Between Days" playing) (Cheering continues) (Fireworks continue popping and whistling) Wonder how she got in with no keys. 
 I'm just glad she's safe. 
 And sometimes the losses can feel overwhelming. 
 Checkmate. 
 And often then you realize winning and losing isn't the point at all. 
 Yesterday I got so old I felt like I could die yesterday I got so old it made me want to cry go on, go on just walk away go on, go on your choice is made and sometimes making a point can be its own triumph. 
 Hey. 
 Nice makeup. 
 Thanks. 
 See you later. 
 I'm going to meet Miller. 
 Said it was true that it couldn't be me Maybe it's true. 
 It doesn't matter if you win or lose, as long as you play. 
 Stay in the game. 
 (Grunts) Hoo. 
 Hey, Bambi. 
 Samantha. 
 Hi. 
 Um, you remember Walt. 
 Of course. 
 Hey, handsome. 
 I'm gay. 
 Sure. 
 Great. 
 What are you doing here? And why are you coming through the window? Remember how you said if I ever needed anything? Yeah. 
 I had to quit the bar because the manager turned out to be a real jerk. 
 He was stealing from the waitresses. 
 What kind of deviant does that? Anyway, I was sorta crashing with him, so kinda homeless. 
 Could I stay here for a couple days? Oh um Yeah. 
 Yeah, sure. 
 Yeah, of course you can stay here. 
 Great. 
 It's gonna be fun. 
 Without you so let me get this straight. 
 In the game of chess, the king is always the weakest piece? Yep. 
 It's still important, but it doesn't have a lot of moves. 
 The queen has all the moves. 
 Ain't that the truth. 
 Maybe I could like this game after all. 
 Maybe it's true in chess and in life So tell me about the knight. 
 Sometimes you have to let a really important piece go to hold onto something else. 
 And right now I was on the board with someone who felt really special. 
 (Both laughing)
