 The matter under discussion involves a-an appendix "Q" scenario, and that means a time-sensitive, ticking bomb terrorist attack. 
 Narrator :  Are we here again? 
 False evidence leading us to an unnecessary war? 
 Leaving a country in chaos? 
 And who benefits? The one percent. Who wants this war? Wall Street. Luke : How is it? Luke, give me a few thousand dollars and a camera, and I can do better than this. No. It's coming from PAC money. We can't coordinate. But I can offer criticism? Well, there's coordinate and then there's coordinate. So? Well, it starts out well, but it's obsessed with the one percent. I mean, I don't think these war hearings are really about financial inequality. Are they? No. So, talk to him. Give him those notes. Who? The filmmaker; he's coming in today. Me? Why me? It sounds better coming from you. It's kind of a "start over" job. Well, that's all right. Right now, we can out-vote the war committee extremists, but it's a razor-thin majority, and public opinion matters. A short, punchy documentary can do wonders, especially if it goes viral. Okay. I'll get my notes together. Good. Narrator :  The one percent wants the war. The rest of us suffer. Congratulations. What an amazing job you've done. Thank you, Senator. It's been you on the barricades, fighting back the hordes, huh? Pistols blazing. There's only one way, Senator. Yes, there is. The One Wayers. Now, Jane... Jules. We're in the fight of our lives. That's why we idealists have to stick together. We're outnumbered. Yes, Senator. Good. I'm glad you understand, because... I want you to hold your breath for the next few minutes. Mm-mm. Not-not literally. Keep your powder dry when I introduce these people to you. Who are they? Are you here to see the senator? I'm here to make a statement. I'm angry. Okay. Hey, here we all are. Thanks for your patience. Ella, hello, and your friend. Why don't you come on in. Senator, would you like me to sit in? No, buddy. I think this one I can take alone. I'll knock if I need you. [shouting over each other] Okay, let's all just calm down. Yes, now that that is out of your system, let's talk. Noah, you represent the No Wayers. And, Jane, you represent the One Wayers; there's nothing you agree on. Ella and I agree on almost nothing. Isn't that right? It is. You are the devil. And she's a bitch, but our methods are similar. We're idealists. We want 100% of what we want. We don't want to compromise. Right. My debate is not with Red, at least not now. My debate is with Democrats who want less, who betray our ideals. Noah, when you first came to me, what did you say? I'm angry. Mm-hmm. And what did you tell me? I'm angry. Red : See? Look at you two. You're two peas in a pod. [Ella chuckles] Red : What did you want? What was your goal when you came to me? Jules : To stop the other... No, no, no, no, no, no. Remember? What did you say about the government? Oh. That we need to burn it down. It's rigged. That's what I said. Ella : You see? She is not the enemy. The enemy... is out there. [low growling] Now, let's be clear here. This vote... this vote to put boots on the ground in Syria is not welcomed by the president. It's not even welcomed by our allies. It is being driven by ideological extremists... Am I an ideological extremist, Senator? Luke : You'll have your 15 minutes, Senator... Me, a man who-who had two people on his staff killed by Syrian terrorists... Diane : Senator Wheatus, please! Luke : We don't know who killed them or even if anyone killed them... Red : We sure as hell do. Senators, I have in front of me over 50,000 signatures from patriotic... [quietly]: How are you? Good. Stop betraying America! Vote for the war! [crowd clamoring] Stop human rights abuses in Syria! Noah : Vote for the war! Now! Whoa, whoa, whoa. Red : Why are we silencing the public? Guard : All right, you guys, out. Out. They are under unprecedented attack. Luke : Senator, you and these protesters are, respectfully, on the wrong side of basic common sense. Red : Let me understand. Your solution... Do you know him? No. He nodded at you. He was just in our office today, with Senator Pollack. Laurel :  I don't know his name... Noah something... But he's the constituent in here who threatened me. I thought you said he was some lefty extremist. I know. But Gareth said he was in his office with Ella. Okay, look, we're still up on the war committee votes. We should be fine. Are you sure? I'm not sure of anything anymore. Hey, the documentary guy is in the conference room. Give him your notes. We may need it. Luke, that's Ben Valderrama. The filmmaker. Yeah. Why? I know him. So? He's become... famous. Good. Give him your notes. No, I-I think you should. Laurel, give him your notes. You represent me. Laurie. Ben, hi. You look amazing. Congrats on-on all your stuff. I mean, your-your documentaries... Thanks. You-you saw them? The one on fracking... Very powerful. Really? I still hate that last shot. It's kind of corny. And you, you're, uh... you've... You're working here. Yeah. Yeah, it's good. It's, uh... Yeah, and-and your work, you were doing something on music? Um, Melanesian choirs. It's still in the works. I-I'm just gathering the money. Well, I'd love to see whatever you have. Remember how we wanted to just... change everything? Yeah. Not just the world but reality, how people saw reality. Yeah. Yeah, we were young. Yeah. We were. So let's talk about saving this country first. Uh, they said you had notes. Yeah, just a few, just... Good, good. I'm open to anything. It's good. It's very good. I'm used to these notes. "It's good, but..." So give me the "but." It's not a big "but." It's, um... it's just the stuff about the one percent. Yeah, it's awful, right? How Wall Street's destroying this country, how no one from the recession went to jail. Yes. But I think this should focus more on the war. But the money is the war. That's the real problem. I know. I just think Luke wants something more focused on this vote coming up. I'm being defensive, aren't I? No, no. Yeah, yeah. It's one of my weaknesses. So tell me. I'm here to learn. What should I do? What's this, uh, war talk about? [indistinct arguing] Noah : I am a normal voter, just a normal voter. You're agreeing with the Republicans... Just give me one minute, Ben. Noah : It's a human rights issue! Luke : You are being used, sir. How dare you accuse me of being a warmonger? The cynical Republicans are using your passion to change... Here we go. If you can't win an argument, just shut it down and drag me out. Well, I got news for you: I'm talking to other senators! You have lost votes, sir! You lost votes, sir! I'm going up and down these halls! Extremists. I'd look at extremists. Luke :  No, I just had one of these crazy people in here. He's talking about going to all the Democratic senators to pressure them into voting for war. Yes, I just had one in here. A Republican. It's Red astroturfing. He's got these groups working for him. We've got to check on the votes,  make sure we're still up. I know. Senator? Yes? Are we still on the same page? Look, I'm up for reelection, just like you are. Oh, come on! And I'm going to entertain all points of view before I vote. Senator, this is all a Red Wheatus operation. And if you change sides, so will others, and we'll lose the majority. I'll call you back. [line beeps] [sighs] Okay. I'm all ears. Why should I change my vote on the war? [sighs] Damn it. Germaine, hi. Did you want me to get Luke? No. I actually wanted to talk to you. So you must be weeks away now. Yes, next week. But we might induce. Do you want to sit? No. Is Luke cheating on me? Is Luke? I don't think so. No. Why? Why? Because he cheated... No, no, I-I know you've had issues in the past. I-I just thought you two worked it out. Yes. But she's still here. [TV playing quietly] The only reason she's here is because we're worried about a lawsuit; that's it. It's over between them. How can you be sure? Because I am. Where were you last night at 11:00 p.m.? Where was I? Yes. I don't know. I guess I-I was here working. Why? Luke said he was with you last night. Right. Yeah, that makes sense. At your home. Trump [over TV] :  We can come back... Look, I don't feel comfortable... [groans, hisses] Germaine, are you okay? Yeah, it's just... this last month. She just kicks really hard. Do you want me to get a doctor? Mm. No, no. They say it'll be over soon. God, it's like having a monster inside me, the way she kicks. A monster? Yeah. Look, this is weird. Every time she hears Trump on TV, she just kicks out. Trump :  Strong, strong, strong. The people... [groans] It's weird. Americans. See, and now she's calm. America first. And now... [groans] Make the country great again. [groans] She just doesn't like Trump, I guess. Germaine, I think we should go to the hospital. No, it's fine. It's just inconvenient. Let's go. We are going to make America rich again. Germaine. Hmm? You shouldn't feel this way. Not like this. Okay? Come on. Monarch :  The campaign continues to heat up, with charges and countercharges flying. The only thing that is certain: this will get uglier. Both candidates have... ♪ ♪ Hello? Ben :  Okay, so this is what I decided. Ben? Yeah. You got a minute? Sure. So I think you're right. I probably went a bit off-track with the one-percent tirade. I get a bit angry. That's okay. No, no. Thanks for the constructive criticism. So I've got some interviews lined up today about these extremist groups. Come by. I want to show you some footage. Okay. I'll call you. All right, later. How'd it go? Is that the sonogram? Uh, this is my sister. Uh, it went well. Everything's healthy. Luke : And should we induce earlier? No, no. We should be fine. Is there anything clearer of the fetus's head? The, uh... No. Why? Is the sonogram always so dark there? What are you looking for? I just think it would be good to-to do a general prenatal rundown on Germaine's health. I just did. The kick tests were normal. She was negative for strep B... Luke, Germaine is in a lot of pain. What else can you do, Doctor? Well, uh, we could do a biophysical profile, combine a stress test with an ultrasound. But you'll have to bring Germaine back; we're not set up for that right now. I can do that. Okay. Uh, I'll arrange a time. Luke : All right. Thanks. What, Laurel? [chuckles] Laurel, what? Germaine didn't come to the office to talk to you. She came there to talk to me. Why? Because she thinks you're cheating. [scoffs] I'm not cheating. Where were you at 11:00 p.m. last night? At work. Why? She asked if we were together because you told her you were at my apartment. What did you tell her? Don't make me lie for you, Luke, ever again. I-I wasn't cheating on her. Look, I-I was with the moderates, thinking through how to deal with this craz... That is such crap. What? Stop lying. If you were with the moderates, you would've told her that. I... [stammers] I... I know. I don't know why I do it. [sighs] I don't want to have to e-explain myself. I go home, I don't want to talk about the whole day. It's so much easier. It's-it's like Holden Caulfield lying. It's not really... Do you know how hard it is to believe in you, Luke? I go to the office every day and defend you and tell the constituents what a great guy you are. Look, I-I'm trying to make a difference. Do you know how close the Senate is to anarchy? That is not an excuse. I'm not saying it's an excuse. I'm-I'm just saying it's like JFK... Oh, come on. Do not use the JFK thing. I'm not a perfect person, Laurel... It's not about being perfect. It's about not screwing around. That's not a high threshold. [sighs] Being perfect is here. This is not screwing around on your nine-month-pregnant wife. So do it. And don't make me lie for you again. I want to believe. What you're doing in the Senate makes a difference, even more than you know, but you have to stay true. You'll stop doing whatever you're doing? Okay. Oh, good. Just in time. Sorry, I got delayed. No, everything's good. I'll show you what footage I got afterwards. Come on. I wanted to catch you before you came in. This guy doesn't know the interview is about extremist groups, so don't say anything. What's he think? Uh, he thinks it's about Republican/Democrat relationships. [scoffs] Laurel, hi. Hi. What are you doing? He's not an extremist. I know. He's Red Wheatus's chief of staff. He's the one who helped astroturf this political group. Thanks for doing this, Gareth. No problem. Any way I can help. If you don't mind, we're gonna start taping now. Sure. So, thanks for sitting with us, Mr. Ritter. Not many Republicans even responded. Well, I'm trying to be more accommodating across the aisle. And you're Red Wheatus's chief of staff? I am. So you have contact with this group, the One Wayers? Some. Didn't you, in fact, help to create this extremist group? I mean, didn't your office create it? Sometimes our office will recognize a certain shared opinion by our supporters. Our office may offer guidance to these individuals, but that's it. Excuse me, Mr. Ritter, but I've interviewed members of these groups, and they all seem to be coordinating their bullet points with you. I think I'll stick with my earlier answer. Oh, come on. You promised to be completely up-front with us here, Mr. Ritter. Isn't it true that the One Wayers wouldn't even exist without your office creating them? Every grassroots movement has funding from somewhere. And I don't really think it matters if some of it was distributed by my office... Come on, Mr. Ritter. Isn't this about the one percent? Okay, that's enough. No, Laurel, I'm not done. Yeah, I think we have enough. Uh, Mr. Ritter, will you please sit back down? I just have a few more questions. No. Can you really defend your position, Mr. Ritter? Can you really? Did you get it? Yep. What's the problem? This stuff was great. He looked completely over his head. It wasn't fair. Oh, come on. That's the drama in documentaries. He didn't know it was gonna be about those questions. He's the enemy. He's a Republican tool. You don't do the cause any good by pulling back. I'm sorry. We can't do this anymore. What, so you're just... breaking it off? I have a child on the way. I have a wife. I don't want to marry you, Luke. I just... want... you. Yes, but I have a child on the way. I-I can't do this anymore. [crying] Oh, come on. Come on, Margie. No. Mm-mm. Mm-mm. It's so sudden. I... [groans] No, I-I can't. I just... [in a whisper] Come on. Mmm. This'll be our good-bye, hmm? [grunting] Hi. Hey. You have a minute? I was just headed home. What do you need? I'll walk you. You don't have to. I know. That was wrong, and I'm sorry. What are we talking about here? Ben. I didn't know he was gonna do that. Laurel, you don't owe me anything. We're on opposite sides of the aisle, you and I. It's all right. Gareth, seriously, I didn't even know you were gonna be there. Laurel, look, we like each other. I won't deny it. But we're in a business where it cannot work. This is our worldviews. It's what I... it's what I believe in. We can't just throw that stuff overboard and pretend it doesn't exist. For a friend, I can. Well, then you're a better person than I am. Because if I throw that stuff overboard, I'm not me anymore. Look, I accepted that interview request because it's what I thought I should do for a friend... I didn't know he was inviting you... And then I realized, I have a job. I have a job that I love, that I believe in. And this friendship is hurting my job. I'm not trying... I didn't say you were. It's structural. I just need to do my job, okay? Maybe when things cool down. When will things ever cool down? I don't know. Soon, hopefully. I have to go home. Bye. 
 
 There you are. Hi. Sorry I'm late. There was this... thing that got in the way. Nothing important. Has the doctor seen you? Yeah. The biophysical profile and the sonogram with the stress test looked great. He took some blood just to be 100% sure there's not an infection going on, but he's not worried. Doctor : Hello. Here's your sister-in-law. Yes. She wanted to hear about the results, too. Good, good. I just need to talk to her for a second, Germaine, if you don't mind. I'm not in danger, am I? No, no, no. I just wanted to talk to her for a second. [door closes] What's wrong? Is there something wrong with the sonogram? You love your sister-in-law, don't you, Ms. Healy? Yes, of-of course. Why? Then I need to ask something of you. What? What's wrong? Stop. Stop what? Stop worrying her. Stop making her think that there's something wrong. There is nothing wrong. She is a healthy mother-to-be. Are you sure? Ms. Healy, the only thing wrong with Germaine is that she has you making her nervous. So stop it. I just want to be sure. I'm sure. Now go home. Take Germaine home and let it rest. I'm sorry. No problem. Now take her home. ["You Might Think" by The Cars playing quietly] [music stops] I just feel like something's wrong. Have you heard of him? Dr. Falcon? Um, no. What'd he say? He did biological profile and some stress test with sonogram. Did he show you the results? No. That's worrisome, isn't it? I don't know. Not necessarily. He asked me to stop making her nervous, and I was going to, until I heard his ring tone. Just give me a sec. Hey. Can you take this? Thanks. Do you think everyone who listens to the song is infected? No, but it's a very old song. It's kind of odd to be using it. Yes, but yesterday I found myself humming it because it's out there and people are listening to it. It's infectious. You think I'm overreacting? No. I don't know. I just am not sure an infant can be infected. I'm going crazy, aren't I? This is how it starts. No. Look, I will check out this doctor and see what I can find out. [Jaime moaning] Jaime : Oh, I'm gonna miss you so much. Luke : I have to stop. Jaime : Don't stop. [moaning, panting] I'm taking a new job at Jackson Birch. Here's my new info. Look, I already told you, Jaime. This is it. I have a child on the way. I know, I know. But here. For a rainy day. Bye. [door opens] [closes] [sighs] Hey. Thanks for doing this. I lost my cameraman to a bris. You don't mind taking over? No problem. Like old times. The union protest. Remember? [chuckles] What are you doing? What do you mean? This guy's... this guy's dangerous. Yeah, I know. It's great, isn't it? No, seriously, Ben. I know. It's perfect for the extremists. Really wild-eyed, foaming at the mouth. Ben, listen to me. This is a guy with a knife. Uh, no. I checked his tote bag. He could get violent; you need to treat him carefully. Look, it's like  Vice. You hear an explosion, you head toward it, not away from it. Someone tries to punch you, you fight back, but with a camera. Come on. It's for the cause, right? Hi, Noah. Nice to meet you. Why don't you, uh, take the tote bag off your shoulder there. Mm... no. I'm good. Ben : Terrific. Let's begin. So, clearly, you're very angry at the status quo in D.C. Aren't you concerned your platform has been bought and paid for by the very people you oppose? I... What? You do oppose the Republicans. Why are you letting them finance you? I am not letting them finance me. I'm-I'm following my issues. Do you want a war? No. I want to end human rights violations. By causing a war? Do you consider yourself a peacenik, sir? "Peacenik" is an outdated term. But you do consider yourself against violence? Yes. Ben : Then why the hell are you working with Republicans and bankers who want to kill? I am not. Yes, you are. Go to hell. Ooh. Now, there's an intelligent response. Is that all you have to say? Come on. You're such an ass. What are you gonna do? Ben... No, if he wants to do something, do it. [yells] [yells] God, this is great. You wanted that to happen. Yeah. We got lucky. You baited him. No. I asked him questions. Wasn't up to me what he did. That's honest. What he did was honest, yes. Look at it. That's honest. Ah, what's wrong? This is good film making? No, this just an event. Something that happened. What we do with it, how we edit it, that's good film making. Laurel, I was asked to make a short viral documentary that would stop the Republicans from fighting another non-war in the Middle East. That's the reason I did this. Am I missing something? No. No, you're not missing anything. How goes the war? Uh, despite the CIA leak, still on track, amazingly. But I've got some moves left. Might be time for you to vote with your head and not with your heart. Meaning? Vote for the war. You're kidding. Luke, you need to start thinking farther out, the long term. There's a new  Wall Street Journal  poll out this morning... Screw that. I'm gonna bomb 100,000 Syrians because of a poll? Luke, look at me. Uh, don't do the "look at me" thing. That big white house over there... it's yours for the taking. So take it. [crowd clamoring] Narrator :  America has gotten angrier. [crowd shouting] [yells] Narrator :  The One Wayers are angry at the No Wayers, and the No Wayers are angry at the One Wayers. And who benefits? The one percent. Who wants this war? Wall Street. The rise of big bankers. Financial inequality. Every grassroots movement has funding from somewhere, and I don't really think it matters if some of it is distributed by my office. Ben : Come on, Mr. Ritter. Isn't this about the one percent? Uh, Mr. Ritter, will you please sit back down? No. I just have a few more questions. Can you really defend your position, Mr. Ritter? Can you... Well? Well, not everything is about Wall Street, Ben. Oh, come on, that's not what it's about. I agree, but that's what your documentary is about. Is this about your Republican friend? No. This is about your documentary. This is about a creative disagreement. Okay. At a certain point, we all have our individual opinions and we need a pair of fresh eyes. So let's hand it in and get those fresh eyes. [audio rewinding] Every grassroots movement has funding from somewhere, and I don't really think it matters if some of it is distributed by my office. [ring tone chiming] Laurel Healy. Rochelle : Where are you? Germaine's water just broke. What? I was doing another sonogram with Germaine, and her water broke. I can't get her OB/GYN. She's here. What... Is Luke there? No. She couldn't get a hold of anyone. [gasps] Is that Luke? Rochelle : Just hang in there, Germaine. I'm on my way. Good. I would get here fast. Is everything normal? I didn't get a chance to look deeper. [groans] Get this thing out of me! Rochelle : We'll find out soon enough. I'll see you in a minute. She's beautiful. She's just... Everything went okay? Yes. Best day ever. Luke : She's amazing. You're amazing. And completely healthy, right? Yes, Laurel. [Luke clears throat] I don't know how to say what I want to say to both of you. To all of you. You don't have to make a speech, Luke. Daddy thinks he's still at work. [chuckles] She has your eyes. Lucky girl. Ah, but those might be Daddy's ears. Did you check her ears? Rochelle : They're fine. Why are you asking so many questions? Is something wrong? No. 'Cause she does look like she has Luke's ears. Can I... can I see? Rochelle : Hey, Laurel? Laurel? [clears throat] Luke : Let's call her... Grace? That's what she is. Hello, Grace. [chuckles]: Look at that expression. What's she thinking? Probably pooping. [laughs] I know I haven't always been the best husband. But... it will be different now. You have to stop. You'll worry them over nothing. Did you check her hearing? Yes. If she was infected in the womb, her ears would be fine. She has had every medical test possible. An MRI of the brain? Laurel, I will not sedate her to ease your fears. Baby's normal. [chuckles] Laurel : Where's Luke? He had to go. [baby fussing] Well, there's this war resolution... Scarlett called. And we might be outnumbered. Don't. Can I hold her? Welcome to the world. Is there really a war resolution? Yes. I can't stop. I tried, but I can't. Then see a therapist. Or go to a support group, or read a book. It's not complicated. Keep your pants zipped. But-but... how? Here's a hint: Don't meet women in their apartments. Don't meet women in hotel rooms. Don't meet women in bars! Wait. The video you sent me, the documentary, it's useless; I can't use it. I didn't send you... I thought you were handling the one percent stuff. Look, I want a propaganda piece about the war. I'm losing the vote. Even Dad thinks I should vote for it. I need this. Narrator :  And who benefits? The one percent. I didn't want to leave without saying good-bye. Right. Um... It's okay, Ben. What's okay? I'm, um... I'm in something right now. You are? What? Something. Well, we made a hell of a video. Keep fighting the good fight here. ♪ Violins start playing ♪ [crowd clamoring] ♪♪ Our country has been overrun. [crowd clamoring] [yells] Not with soldiers, not with tanks, but with... an infection. The infection is an idea. An idea of revolution. Extremism. Not just Republican, but Democrat. Ben : A few more questions. Can you really defend your position, Mr. Rit... ♪ more and more intense ♪ [gentle piano music playing] I know we haven't, uh... been together for a while. But to be clear, we won't again. And you have to find another job. What? Uh, you'll get severance and the best referral. You can't just get rid of me. I wouldn't use those words, but, as of now, you no longer work for me. Uh, hey... Don't touch me. You weak man. I'm sorry. Sorry doesn't come close to what you are. Okay, uh... Give my regards to Germaine. She's not part of this. All right. I'll give my regards. [choir humming] Laurel :  Our country has been overrun. Not with soldiers, not with tanks, but with an infection. [video stops] Stop betraying America! Vote for the war! Stops human rights abuses in Syria! Vote for the war! Laurel :  An infection of extremism. An infection that pursues purity and believes it's better to burn down the government and start over than to compromise even one iota. Jules : I'm angry. Since when can the government just do what it wants? Noah : This is why voters have to get involved: to show politicians how angry we are. We are angry. Tell a woman to do something! Then maybe we can name something after a woman. Laurel :  The extremist leaders are collaborating in secret. They have more in common with each other than they do with their own party. Red : See, that's why they call it "the grassroots." 'Cause it's so stupid. [chuckles]: I could go out on Fifth Avenue with a flamethrower, and they'd still kiss my feet. [chuckles]: Right? Tell your senators and congressmen to vote against this war. After all, their voices should echo ours. Red : Jesus should be asking me for forgiveness. We decide. [loud crash] And that is the point. [chuckles softly] Diane : Senator Pollack? Ella : Aye. Diane : Senator Wheatus? Red : Aye, damn it. Diane : Belligerence noted. Senator Healy? No. And the chair votes no, damn it. [applause] The war resolution is defeated and will not be sent to the full Senate. Senator, with all due respect, the American people... The American people sent us here to make informed, intelligent decisions on their behalf. And that is the point. [scoffs] [applause] Some are calling it "the little video that could." And it really did, didn't it? You know, Claudia, the country needed a wake-up call. I'm just happy I could make the point that needed to be made. Claudia : It's been seen by the members of the Senate Intelligence Committee, as well as over four million people online. More important, it probably saved us from another needless war. How the hell did you do all that? Yeah, how? Ben : Someone needed to focus on the big picture. This isn't a left or right issue, it's about extremism. The kind of mindless debate that leads us to forget who we are. [ring tone chiming] Claudia :  I'm curious, Ben. Where did the idea to do this come from? I mean, it's so provocative, so elegantly done. Hello? Can you believe this guy? I'm used to it. I know it was you.

[crying continues] [mobile playing "You Might Think" by The Cars] [crying stops]
