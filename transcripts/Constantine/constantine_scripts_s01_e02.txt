 Previously on constantine: 
 My name is John Constantine. 
 Dr. Huntoon : "Exorcist, demonologist (growl) Manny : There's a darkness rising, John. People can sense what's on the way. Chas : It's happening everywhere. Manny : If you figure out what we're up against, I will use that knowledge to save lives. - What about my life, eh? You damned a girl to hell, and along with her, your soul. At least for a moment, anyway. Are you suggesting that it's not too late  for me to save my soul? Manny : That mean you're going to help us? Constantine : I walk my path alone. Because, let's be honest, who would be crazy enough to walk it with me? (whistle blows) (indistinct chatter) (door shuts) Bad day? (grunts) Lannis? Three more on my shift threatened to quit today. Candy asses. They still hearing the sounds? Don't you start in, too. They put me in charge of a bunch of... Johnny Newcomes barely old enough to shave. There's nothing down in that mine for 'em to hear. Why don't you go on and get yourself cleaned up. I'll have your dinner ready when you get out. I'm hungry now. It's not ready. (water running) (gurgling) (grunts, shouts) (creaking) What the hell? (screaming) Chas : Uh, working on your skills? Just one. Patience. Where the bloody hell have you been? I had to wait till the daily double. It was your only pick that paid off. Capnomancy isn't an exact magic. Divining the future through the movements of rising smoke, it's a tricky business. I would think you'd be an expert. Saddle up. We're heading to Pennsylvania. Look at the map. Chas : One of the drops is wet. Mmm. Our destination is the tiny town of Heddwich. According to local papers, a mining boss was just flash-fried in his shower. Well, you're on your own. Pennsylvania? The succubus on a freight train? That warrant still stands? Funny what a long memory the law has when it comes to train derailments. (horn blowing) ♪ ♪ (church bell ringing) Who are you? You're really starting to piss me off. Oh, I'm so sorry. Oh. Well, the apologies are all mine, luv. Let's, uh, get you sorted, yeah? If there's one thing I know my way around, it's rubbish. It's... you. You're you. (chuckles) That observation always ends in the same way, and it's never in my favor. I dream about you. I... was starting to believe you weren't real. Who are you? (chuckles) Some kind of carnival quick-draw artist, are we? Perched and peeking in a window. Scratch out the visage of some poor lonely sod, and then bump into him as if you're his long-lost lover. Tongue in his ear, hand in his pocket, I bet. It's a nice play, luv, but I think I'll sit this one out. No. It's the dirty blond hair. The curled lip. The bad posture. I have excellent posture. I've seen it all. Well, not well, apparently. There. Eyes are much darker than this one. No. I don't know who you are. Please. Okay. You want answers. One artist to another. In light, I always find mine. John Constantine. Stout. That kind of irony is hard to ignore, isn't it? The town's symbol being a dragon and... This sorry soul being burned alive. So what's your take on what happened? Fire through the pipes? It's rare. But it happens in mining towns. Well, maybe if there's fracking. But isn't this the land of hard rock mining? What do you know about it? Grew up in Liverpool, mate. Breathed in more coal dust than fresh air as a lad. Lannis! Others : Hear. Must've been a good bloke. Lannis was a b*st*rd. But they closed the mine for the day. Fellas around here don't need an invitation to get a skinful. Man : Another pitcher, Charlie. Have you considered actual dragons as the guilty party? There's no natural explanation of what happened to poor Lannis, is there? You got that right. But it weren't no dragon that took Lannis and the others. The others? Nine others. All in the last year. They died like this bloke? Mining accidents. Some of the boys are saying we dug a little too deep. We knocked on the door of hell, and now hell is knocking back. Someone heard knocking? Yeah. Down in that godforsaken tunnel. ♪ ♪ Whoa! ♪ ♪ (grunting, panting) (loud knocking, rumbling) (panting) (groans loudly) Woman : Find what you're looking for? (sighs) As a matter of fact, no. My name's John Constantine. Philly Enquirer. I didn't notice you out front with all the others. I've been hiding back here. My husband's death hit me very hard. You've got some, uh, coal there. On your arm. Oh. You can't escape it around here. The soot. The grime. Seeps into every pore and fiber. I mean, this doesn't really make sense, does it? And if you don't mind me asking, what do you think happened? Does it really matter? Lannis is gone. Well, if you help me, I might write a story that celebrates his life. Because our life was just one big celebration. Sorry. You're sweet. You know, I've heard rumors that there's... something not... natural down in that mine. Your husband ever talk about it? You want a story? Yeah. Okay. I have one for you. It's about a Romani girl. She got letters from a man... a rich man... who wanted to marry her. Make her his queen. Said he was the captain of industry. Failed to mention it was coal. Now, will that story sell papers? We can talk at a later date. It's fine. Why? I'm free now. Uh... Look, you're a lovely bird and everything, but I'm not being... Out. Out! All right, I'm going. All right. I'm leaving. Get out. I'm going. I want you gone. All right, all right, I'm going. There's no need to cause a fuss, right? Someone get him out. I want him out. Who is this? He says he's a reporter. Yeah. Hey. Hey. Hey! Nobody messes with my people. What is it you want here? It's as the lady said... I'm a reporter. Check him. (Constantine chuckling) Ow. Now, I'm gonna ask you one more time. Oh. Who the hell are you? I take it you're the boss of the mine. Yes. I'm the president of the NorPenn Mining Company. You're upsetting the widow of one of my respected men. We both know that's not true. Take it easy, Thad. He might be with Environmental Protection. This one? No chance. Oh, in a way, your associate there is not wrong. You've got a not-so-natural disaster down in that mine. You know it and I know it. What I can't figure out is why it's come above ground to kill one of your men. You listen to me... I don't know what sleazy tabloid you write for, but I got my hands filled here with scared miners. The biggest threat to them are parasites like you spreading panic and fear. You heard it as well, didn't you? The knocking. Go home. (exhales) (chuckling sigh) Well, I'll give you this... you are persistent. The honeymoon suite? I always get the honeymoon suite. Lots of extra space. There's a good energy to it. You dropped this. There was 90 quid in there. You must have dropped that, too. You know, I described you to the very nice young man at the front desk, and he said you're registered under the name of, um, Caligari. Bud Caligari. But your I.D. and the boarding pass I found in the trash can says your name is John Constantine. The rubbish again? You're a girl after my own heart... Zed. How do you know my name? Credit card receipt from your trash. So I did make an impression. Well, call me balmy, but I like to know who's stalking me. I'm not stalking you. You know, you've just been in my head for months. And then, you know, all of a sudden, you're here? Don't you want to know why? I don't seek answers to questions that needn't be asked. Well, I do. I don't know anything about you, but I feel like I should. Running into each other today... that's destiny. Well, if it's destiny that you're after, then maybe you should take that 90 quid and put it on the lottery. You mean something to me. You know, and maybe I mean something to you, too. A reason to elevate my personal security. I have visions I can't control. And sometimes, feelings. Listen, Zed... I'm starting to like you. A little bit. But not enough to let you stay, so if you don't mind, would you... What is that? Loneliness. Pain. Desperation. These things motivate you. What kind of person is motivated by these things? So much guilt, John Constantine. (short chuckle) Clairsentient. Or maybe just a good guesser. Okay. You want answers? Let's see what you got. Park it. You'll do everything I say, you understand? Yes. Close your eyes. I want you to see an image in your mind. It's a total whiteout. Absorbing all sound, except for the sound of my voice. Are you with me? Good. There's a white dove lost in the snowstorm. You need to save it. Hold out your hand. Open your senses. And let the dove come to you... now. (screaming) Zed. Zed! (crying) Zed. Zed. (soft whimper) (exhales) You saw the fire. Was that the man in town who was burning? What else did you see? A tall cross. All right. You did a cracking job. Well, we're on to something, you and me. I'm just gonna take a quick change, then we're gonna get to the bottom of this, all right? Good. (muffled clattering) John? John? Constantine! (man grunting) You'll make yourself known if you know what's good for you. (grunting stops) Really? In a church? Man : Sorry. Don't apologize to me, mate. Put your clothes on, will you? What's this business? Just a story. You know, meant to be scary. Tall man, no face. Follows you home, peeps in your window. It's... It's not very original. All right, go on. Run home. All right. (low, rumbling growling) (gasping) (panting) Have you seen an English man? Who wears a trenchcoat? Stick you with a bar tab, too? (sighs) My advice... don't waste yourself on that one. I don't have a choice. My son had that effect... when he was alive. Left behind clutches of weepy girls who swore he was the only one to give their life meaning. It's not like that. It's like that, but not the way you think. I mean, it's just that... he means something to me. I don't know what. Well, there was a time when people came to me for answers. But now our barkeep hears more confessions in one day than I used to hear in a month of Sundays. Bartender : Here you go. Thank you. So, your son's the reason you left your faith? I left the church when the mine swallowed him. But I didn't leave my faith. Can't say I had much to begin with. Faith... is an unshakable acceptance with no room for doubt. I'll never have that now. Cursed mine has seen to that. Hello, luv. Is it morning already? You leave when I want you, and you're here when I don't. (keys jingle onto table) I'll make it easy for you. Get out! Get up! Oh, don't be that way, luv. I don't want you! I had to verify that which you provided. A strict security protocol is, in fact, required in my business. I still don't know what you do. (sighs) What I am, as you have so... conventionally portrayed... an exorcist, demonologist and... occasional dabbler in the dark arts. Now, the question is... who are you? I'm Zed. Right. Zed Martin. I found your three-month lease. So, what's a chica bonita in her mid-20s  doing slumming it in a one-horse Welsh mining town in the middle of Pennsylvania? I travel a lot. Right. Well, there's only two types of people who travel.. a lot. Those in the circus and... those on the run, and curiously, I'm not seeing any funny wigs or face paint. I know what I'm running from. Do you? You came to me, not the other way around. You step into my world, you'll be staring down demons, devils and the like. Those things in your paintings... they're real. Yeah. It won't be... bad memories nipping at your heels, but the scourge of hell gunning for your soul. And when the bell rings, then you'd best be ready, willing and able to answer with something far more deadly than a charcoal pencil. Now, if you can handle that, then we can talk business. If not, then we go our separate ways and I never see your pretty little face again. I ain't going nowhere. (alarm sounding) Is that what I think it is? A mine collapse. 
 
 (indistinct, overlapping shouting, alarm sounding) Hey. Hey, what happened here? It all came down right on top of us. Before it happened, knocking. Did you hear knocking? Yeah. It's in there. (indistinct, overlapping shouting, alarm sounding) All right. Thanks, mate. John! If Thad catches you here, he's gonna make good... Men are dying in your mine. (sighs) Five years ago, Heddwich was dead. NorPenn saved this town. They-they... They said the mine was tapped out, but we gave it new life. Because you're a rogue operation, digging unauthorized tunnels into regions of the earth where mortal man has no rightful place. It's true, isn't it? What the miners are saying? They hear sounds? And they'll keep on hearing them, and people will keep dying until you shut down that mine. (loud clacking, loud gurgling of liquid) What is that? What the hell? We need something to break the windows now. Check under the seat. What the hell?! Oh, God. (grunting) (groaning and whimpering) (loud groaning) (muffled groaning) (panting) (groaning) (Constantine choking) (grunts) (gasping) Are you okay? Oh, yeah. I had it under control. (coughs) You almost drowned in mud. No, I was, uh... thinking up a spell in my head. Go check on the driver. (coughing) (Constantine panting) Don't torture yourself over it, luv. There was nothing we could do for the blighter, and the last thing we want to do is stick around and get drawn into a police investigation. I don't understand. What was in the car? That's the price of doing business with yours truly. I tried to warn you. I know. I'm still here. (men laughing) Piss off. There's nothing to look at. What's going on? Back home, our miners called 'em "Coblynau," but you see 'em in every culture. They're the spirits of dead miners. They knock on walls to warn of danger. So, these Coblynau... they're protecting the miners? They warn them of danger instead of causing it? That's right. Traditional Coblynau... they never rise to the surface, and they certainly don't murder. So, what's the explanation? Could be the Rising Darkness. Something's forcing evil to the surface in waves. It's changing the rules. I'm sensing a little of the human touch. Like someone's... calling these spirits on purpose. Nothing says payback better than death by demon. If I'm right, then someone's conjuring these bad boys from close by. Like a miner. I heard that they're all gathering at the pub for an emergency meeting. Think we need to change, luv. I'll meet you there. Thad : All right, look, if you're just gonna fly off the handle and turn this into some kind of a spook show, then I have nothing to say to you right now. Crazy rumors aren't gonna help anyone... Curious. Skeptical drunks nowhere to be seen. You mean the ex-priest? Come again? Ellis. He used to be a priest before his, uh, son died in the mines. Which could be a good cause for payback. When I gave you the slip yesterday, I found evidence of one of those slurry things being raised in an abandoned church outside of town. The church that Ellis turned his back on. So, he could be the one that's conjuring the evil for revenge? Come with me. I'm taking you for a spin. Excuse me, mate, um, but, look, my lady... Hmm? She's having a bit of a turn, you know? Do you mind if we commandeer your seat right here? Oh, no, no, no. Is that all right? Oh, thanks a lot, mate. Thanks. (man clears his throat) Take a seat. I get it, okay? This is his stool, his spot, where he drinks, but I can't control my visions. Well, you did yesterday. Just remember what I told you. Now close your eyes. (sighs) Lock out the world. It's cold. What's that, luv? My feet. Slowly, without losing the vision, open your eyes. Look at your feet. (laughs) There's a river. (chuckles) There's a waterfall. Stay in the vision. Look for clues. There's a... tent, and an old chair in front of it. Like a sofa chair. Looks like a campground. You two decide yet? Charlie, is there a... a campground on a river hereabouts? Rooster Creek's the closest. Rooster Creek. How can such a weak man be capable of so much destruction? Well, people aren't all good, and they aren't all wicked. Here, bristles up to ward off evil. What are you gonna use? My wits. Are you the Pastor Ellis McGee of the Good Shepherd Church of St. Asaph? Not anymore. Et separabunt traductionem alicuius, et omnes Satanae in votis pacta... Both :  Spiritualia, et animam vinculo, et opera Satanae. You know it. Of course I know it. The Breastplate of St. Patrick. What the hell's going on here? I'm here to end your spiritual warfare. Your skills to channel the divine can also be used to unleash evil. You think I'm behind the killings in this town? Your desecrated church has all the power of evil you need, mate. You need faith to raise evil. In case you haven't noticed here, I'm all tapped out. You know, John, maybe we should listen to him. Fools. You got to get your head out of the hogwash. You can't even see the facts right in front of you. Like what? Ellis : The men killed aboveground, they're not miners... they're the bosses in charge. Somebody's finally making them pay. You might be right. How many of the bosses are left? Just one. Owner of the company, Thad Bowman. You have art supplies in your car, right? Yeah. Spray paint's what we need. Come on. Coming, boy? Yeah, I'm right here, Dad. Peterson said he cleared the east shaft, but I also know that little yellow-belly was scared to go down there. I want to see it for myself before the men start showing up again at first light. Listen, you really think that this is a good idea, opening the mine after what happened yesterday? Men want to work, boy. You got to respect that. It looks clear to me. Let's check the down shaft. (panting) You really think we should be doing this? Don't you start, boy. (rumbling) (screeching) Thad : Nathan! (screeching) (low growling) It is real. (growling) Paint. (clanging) Protector of Earth... Guardian of the Soils of Foundation, be welcome in this sacred space. By the Earth that is your body, and the wisdom of the ancients... Hail and farewell. (low growl fades) What did we do? I reminded it of what it is: a protective spirit. As I said, Coblynau are peaceful buggers at heart. He's still breathing. He's okay. This one's not so lucky. Qué Dios lo bendiga. So we're back where we started from. (grunts) These handprints... I've seen this before. Where? We need to make sure that no one comes down here again. Ever. Take him home. What are you gonna do? There's only one thing I can think of. What's the priest doing here? He needs to be here to see this. You did good earlier. If I failed to mention it. Well, now I know what line of work you do. It's not for everyone, luv. So, after this, you find a nice, quiet new town? (quietly): Yeah. Because I'm that kind of, uh... chica bonita. We really don't want to be standing here. Constantine : Sometimes appeals of faith just need a little time to be answered. Care to do the honors? (quietly): For my son. (click, beep) I need your car keys. They're in the truck. Where are you going? To do the hard part, of course. We just blew up the mine. That we did. And the Coblynau will stay at rest if they're left alone. But someone with a very powerful magic summoned them to the surface in the first place. This isn't over. The reporter, right? Philly Enquirer? (chuckles softly) Can I come in? I'm afraid I have guests. I know who killed your husband. In that case... I think you should meet my guests. Well, aren't you going to invite me in, then? No need. (Coblynau growling) Now... you had news for me? I'll give you one chance. Send your pets away and I'll spare you. How did you know? The coal mark on your arm when I first met you. I saw one just like it on a young lad the Coblynau were trying to kill. And then... I remembered what you said. You're Romani. There's nothing blacker than gypsy magic. When I left home, I promised myself I'd never use my family's magic again. (Coblynau growling) And then it all came back to me, more powerfully than ever before. The only reason you could do what you did is because there's a darkness spreading everywhere, even to lonesome little backwaters like Heddwich. It's infecting you. No. You're wrong. Send these poor sods back to where they belong. (growls) Kill him. (Coblynau growling) (Constantine groans) You forgot one thing, you stupid bat! These are the spirits of dead miners, and your husband, that you murdered, was a miner! Oh, restless spirit of this house, I summon thee to seek thy revenge! (low gasp) (rumbling) (whimpers) Lannis? No! (hisses) Let go of me! No! I'm the victim! (screaming) (scream fading, echoing) (pants) (groaning) (panting) (crickets chirping softly) (exhales) (door closes) (sighs) Moving in, are we? You wish. Well, I'm afraid I'm in no mood for sparring tonight, darling. Of course not. You almost died. I just wanted to make sure you're okay. No, you didn't. You just wanted to make sure I didn't run out on you again. Was that the plan? Listen, Zed... there's no denying that you provide moderate value in the field. I saved your life. Well, that's open to debate. The truth is, I work best alone. Me, too. I always put myself first. That's the only way I've survived. Everyone who puts their trust in me dies. Okay, you got me. (sighs): You see, John... I've been waiting for you... and you found me. I don't know what I've been waiting for, and you don't know what you've found. The question is, are we gonna help each other out or not? (sighs) (groans) If you'll excuse me, I'm bloody knackered. (groans) Constantine : I suppose it could be liberating to take a leap of faith, to shrug off  the burden of proof for the promise of hope. It takes trust to turn darkness to light. And those who trust risk putting their faith in the wrong hands. For there are those who pray for you... and there are those who prey on you. And no matter how careful you are, sometimes you just can't tell the difference.
