  I want you to talk to me. 
  I don't have anything to say!

  Oh, I can't. 
  Today's the day I meet the network. 
  Oh. 
  Are you asking them to get rid of Drew? 
  Yup. 
  Got to. 
  I mean, I can deal with him for the rest of this season, but he can't come back next year. 
  [NAT] 
  That's very reasonable. 
  - Yeah. 
  - Wow, good luck. 
  Okay, so, should I pick up dinner for us then? 
  - Yeah, that'd be great. 
  - Yup. 
  Oh. 
  And then, can we please - watch Below Deck?

  I have to find out if Hannah stays with that guy. 
  Yeah, of course. 
  Hey, guys, can you not watch that without me? 
  I mean, can we make that a rule? 
  Like, if it's at sea, it's got to be three? 
  That was really bad. 
  - Yeah, it wasn't your best. 
  - Well, it's early. 
  I'll find it. 
  [DANI]

  But I actually have another call right now. 
  Mm-hmm. 
  This is Dani. 
  Great, my mom landed an hour ago, and went straight to the pot shop. 
  - Oh, sativa pen, please. 
  - No, no, it's too late. 
  She, uh, she got 24 gummies. 
  Oh, damn. 
  She's gonna be stoned when she meets JosÃ© later. 
  Yeah. 
  I wish my mom smoked a little more weed. 
  - Calm her ass down. 
  - [PHONE VIBRATING] 
  - Oh, sh1t. 
  Hold on. 
  - [DANI] 
  Yes, I-I have it. 
  - Just give me one second to pull it up.

  - [MICAH] 
  Are you gonna go now? 
  - Yeah. 
  Oh, I-I'll come with you.

  Hi! 
  How are you? 
  - Come on in. 
  - Hi, my baby. 
  - Hi, Mom. 
  - Oh, my goodness. 
  I miss you so much. 
  [LAUGHS] 
  Aw. 
  You lost weight. 
  [TINA] 
  Oh, my God, it's beautiful in here. 
  Dana would have loved this place. 
  - [SOFT ROCK PLAYING] 
  - I think so, too. 
  And the place is picking up business. 
  Yeah, it's incredible. 
  - Just so pretty in here. 
  - Should I take this? 
  - No. 
  - Yes, yes. 
  Yes. 
  [TINA] 
  Is Alice not coming? 
  No. 
  She's still mad at you. 
  Ooh. 
  For the Felicity thing? 
  I have apologized - and apologized and apologized. 
  - I know. 
  I know. 
  I know, and I told you to give her time. 
  - She'll come around. 
  - Yeah. 
  So, how's Quiara? 
  Quiara's good. 
  We're gonna hear the baby's heartbeat today. 
  - Oh, my God. 
  - Oh, my God. 
  [BETTE] 
  I still remember hearing Angie's - first little heartbeat. 
  - Oh, my God, me, too. 
  It was like this little sign of this big life to come. 
  It was so special. 
  - It was amazing. 
  - Oh. 
  - We were sobbing. 
  - Sobbing. 
  - Just bawling. 
  - I was destroyed. 
  - Yeah? 
  - Yeah. 
  Oh, and what is it that you said - that it sounded like? 
  - Like horses - stampeding in mud. 
  Yeah. 
  - Horses stampeding in mud. 
  [LAUGHS] 
  [CLEARS THROAT] 
  Speaking of our daughter, I will be over later to pick her up for the museum. 
  And then you're gonna drop her off at Jordi's 'cause they're gonna watch a movie. 
  - You know what that means. 
  - [TINA] 
  Hey. 
  Don't do that. 
  Don't freak her out. 
  - I'm just being honest. 
  - No, no, no, no. 
  I can't. 
  I can't hear it. 
  I'm not ready. 
  I'm not ready to hear it. 
  - Okay. 
  All right. 
  - Are you available tonight? 
  For dinner? 
  Just us. 
  Uh Sure. 
  Yeah. 
  That would be nice. 
  I mean, you know, actually, why don't you come by the house, and I'll cook? 
  - Okay. 
  - [PHONE VIBRATING] 
  Oh. 
  That is Carrie. 
  Um [CLEARS THROAT] 
  Let me take this really fast. 
  Hmm. 
  What? 
  You just seem a little flushed. 
  Hormones. 
  [PERCY] 
  Let me know if you have any more questions. 
  We're gonna be back to prep her for surgery shortly. 
  And if you need anything before that, the nurse's station is just outside the door. 
  Okay. 
  Thank you. 
  - [DOOR CLOSES] 
  - I don't like her. 
  - Should we get a second opinion? 
  - Okay, no, no, no, no, no. 
  - We don't have time for that. 
  - I don't like this place. 
  Okay? 
  They said it was a very simple procedure. 
  - They know what they're doing. 
  - If anything happens to her Oh, my God. 
  - Hey. 
  Hey! 
  - If anything, I swear to God. 
  Stop. 
  Okay? 
  - Yeah, Mami, stop.

  You hungry? 
  I could get you something. 
  What do you want? 
  - I could do coffee.

  - All right. 
  - Well, what do you want? 
  - Anything. 
  - Okay. 
  I'll be right back. 
  - Yeah. 
  Okay. 
  Oh, God, I don't know what to do. 
  - Hey. 
  - I swear, she's gonna be okay. 
  She's gonna be fine. 
  [MONITOR BEEPING] 
  [WOMAN SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY OVER P. A. ] 
  [CRYING] 
  Hey! 
  I got some supplies. 
  I got Cheetos, Funyuns, Snoballs all your major food groups. 
  And you'd think Cheetos and Funyuns would be in the same food group. 
  However, it's Oh, Bubba, come here. 
  I Hold on. 
  Hold on. 
  Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey. 
  It's okay. 
  Come here. 
  Come here. 
  Come here. 
  Come here. 
  - [SIGHS] 
  - Shh. 
  - Oh. 
  - [CRIES] 
  I know. 
  It's okay. 
  Oh. 
  I know. 
  It's okay. 
  - It's okay. 
  - [SOBBING] 
  It's okay. 
  - [CRIES] 
  - [EXHALES] 
  [SHUSHING] 
  [CRIES] 
  I just [SNIFFLES] 
  [SIGHS] 
  I don't want to lose her. 
  - [SNIFFLES] 
  - It'll be okay. 
  [SNIFFLES] 
  Oh. 
  It's gonna be okay. 
  [SIGHS] 
  Thank you. 
  I-I really do appreciate it. 
  Okay. 
  So that was my buddy. 
  And he works at a local CBS affiliate, and he was Why has this line not f*cking moved? 
  It's fine. 
  It's fine. 
  People can hear you. 
  - Sorry. 
  - Okay. 
  So, your-your friend at CBS? 
  Right, and he was saying that Milner's team bought up a ton of airtime. 
  They're gearing up to launch something big. 
  I'm hearing that it's going to be a negative attack campaign. 
  And I know he said he wouldn't, but he's-he's going for it. 
  Milner's a lot of things, but he's not a liar. 
  He's never been backed into a corner before. 
  He's scared. 
  He's gonna go for blood, and he's gonna run those ads. 
  And we're just gonna drown him out with policy and voter outreach. 
  But if he goes for you with-with only two weeks left, and we don't have a negative ad to counter with, then we're kind of f*cked. 
  Your job is to help me shape my message and get it out into the world. 
  Thanks, sweetheart. 
  All right, all right. 
  Thank you. 
  - Hello. 
  - Hi. 
  Two medium coffees, one with room, one without. 
  - Please. 
  - Please. 
  Coming right up. 
  As your acting campaign manager, I strongly advise you to at least let me prepare a negative ad. 
  We don't have to run it. 
  Okay, I hear you, and the answer is still no. 
  Thank you. 
  It's just really frustrating that you won't let me do my job. 
  I'm just trying to protect you. 
  - Thank you. 
  - You're welcome. 
  - [PHONE RINGING, VIBRATING] 
  - Oh, yeah. 
  This is Dani. 
  Yeah. 
  No, I-I haven't seen it. 
  No. 
  No, that can't be right. 
  What the f*ck? 
  sh1t. 
  Where's the ? 
  Oh, f*ck. 
  Oh, sh1t. 
  It's okay, I'm nervous, too. 
  I'm not nervous, I'm just curious. 
  - Sure you are. 
  - [DOOR OPENS] 
  - Quiara. 
  - Hi. 
  Hi. 
  How have you been feeling? 
  - Good. 
  - Good. 
  Excited, for the most part. 
  - Okay. 
  - Did you tell her about the nausea? 
  Oh, I've been feeling a little nauseous lately. 
  Uh, this is my wi You can join us. 
  This is my wife, Shane. 
  - Hi. 
  How you doing? 
  - Hi. 
  Nice to have you with us today. 
  - Thank you. 
  Thank you. 
  - [CHUCKLES] 
  I think I'm your ex-wife, technically. 
  The nausea will subside once you get to your second trimester, but if it doesn't, let me know. 
  I'll get you something for it. 
  Can you give me something for all the extra McFlurrys - I've been eating lately? 
  - 'Fraid not. 
  Okay. 
  Are you ready to hear your baby's heartbeat? 
  [QUIARA] 
  Yes. 
  Uh, yes. 
  I'm ready. 
  I'm so ready. 
  We're ready. 
  You ready? 
  - You ready? 
  - Yeah. 
  Yeah, yeah. 
  Here. 
  Okay. 
  This might be a little cold. 
  [QUIARA] 
  Okay. 
  First you'll hear your own heartbeat. 
  [QUIARA] 
  This is crazy. 
  [LAUGHS] 
  - That's you. 
  - [HEART BEATING] 
  And then there'll be another sound. 
  [TWO HEARTS BEATING] 
  Right there. 
  That's it. 
  That's your baby. 
  ATMOSPHERIC MUSIC [SNIFFLES] 
  Oh, my God. 
  [TWO HEARTS BEATING] 
  Shane that's our baby. 
  Yeah. 
  You know, it sounds like horses stampeding through the mud. 
  Oh, it does sound like horses stampeding through the mud. 
  [LAUGHS] 
  [SNIFFLES] 
  I'm the sh1t I know I'm the sh1t, yeah, I'm super lit If you don't buy me what I want I'm-a throw a fit I'm the sh1t, I know I'm the sh1t Thank you so much for meeting. 
  I really appreciate it. 
  [BARRY] 
  We're all anxious to hear what you have to say. 
  Well, I just wanted to catch up and, you know, see how you think the show's been going this season. 
  Maybe talk about process, things that I thought we could do to improve where I thought my Sorry, sorry, sorry. 
  I'm a few minutes late. 
  - [BARRY] 
  Hey-hey, Drew! 
  - Hi. 
  We're just getting started. 
  Hey. 
  Go on. 
  Um, I didn't know you were gonna be in this meeting. 
  Course. 
  Wouldn't miss it. 
  Right. 
  So [SIGHS] 
  I'm very, very proud of what the show's done this season. 
  We haven't made any conventional guest choices. 
  The set is incredible. 
  The writers are next-level. 
  I just, there are a lot of voices in the room, and I'm having a hard time hearing my own. 
  So I would like to make some changes, - maybe next season. 
  - Well, um, we're hoping to make some changes before then, because, quite frankly, we don't know if there will be a next season. 
  Your show's on the bubble, Alice. 
  [QUIETLY] 
  I-It's [DREW] 
  "The bubble's" a term - they use just wh - I know what a bubble is. 
  Thanks. 
  [BARRY] 
  Your ratings are way off our targeted numbers, and between our production budget and our P-and-A numbers, you're operating at a deficit. 
  [DREW] 
  It's been a steady decline. 
  [BARRY] 
  For us, a couple viral hits would go a long way. 
  Short form, catchy content is the name of the game. 
  Okay. 
  Okay. 
  That's my specialty. 
  Na-Nasty Hmm. 
  How short are we? 
  We're about 20% below our target for the month. 
  [GROANS] 
  Oh, Jesus Christ. 
  I know. 
  Just give it some time, okay? 
  How much time, Tess? 
  Seriously. 
  - Can you give me a time frame? 
  - Oh, my God, look, the bar's gonna be fine, okay? 
  - Everything's gonna be fine. 
  - All right, all right, all right, all right. 
  I promise, Shane, everything's gonna be fine. 
  All right, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. 
  I just Quiara and I had a morning. 
  It's not you. 
  Okay. 
  [SIGHS] 
  Oh, God, I don't know what I'm doing. 
  So, did you tell her that? 
  - Did you talk to her? 
  - I have nothing new to say. 
  [LAUGHS] 
  I'm sorry. 
  - Why is that funny? 
  - Okay, so, um, in my meeting this morning, there was this guy, right, and he says: imagine someone comes up to you and says that they're hungry, and you have a sandwich, and so you offer them the sandwich, but then they say, "Nah. 
  I've had sandwiches before. 
  I want something new". 
  And you're like, "It doesn't need to be new. 
  Just eat the sandwich". 
  What, you want me to eat a sandwich? 
  No. 
  You have to talk to her. 
  You have to talk to Quiara. 
  Again and again and again, all the time. 
  Talk to her. 
  I'm glad you're going back to those meetings. 
  [PHONE RINGING] 
  Three days sober, baby. 
  Three days? 
  Wow. 
  Good for you. 
  "RIDING WITH ME" BY FROOGLE Dana's. 
  Yes. 
  Great. 
  I bet I never notice till it's all gone I'm feelin' so strong like my last smoke Light-headed with the flow, I need a Tylenol Underneath my soul I disinfected with the alcohol And now I'm on, but now I'm grown Oh, oh [GRACE] 
  Actually Mmm! 
  [GASPS] 
  Everything looks so good! 
  Oh I'm so hungry! 
  Yeah. 
  You-you tell him how many edibles you had? 
  I had four. 
  [LAUGHS] 
  Oh, no! 
  But they were cute little gummy bears, and they were champagne-flavored. 
  But, I mean, how was I supposed to know not to enjoy in excess. 
  Right? 
  But he was so sweet. 
  He called me up all afternoon to make sure I was okay. 
  He's so thoughtful. 
  - Okay, Mom. 
  All right. 
  - And responsible. 
  I swear, if the Cub Scouts had been more forward-thinking back then, my baby would have made a great Cub Scout. 
  Could he be a cub? 
  I don't see that for him. 
  No? 
  Really? 
  He's very crafty. 
  Very crafty. 
  Always has been, ever since he was a little girl. 
  Can I get something started for you? 
  Uh, I think, I think we need a little minute, please. 
  [GRACE] 
  Oh, I found it! 
  Look! 
  - So cute! 
  - Mom. 
  - Mom. 
  Mom, please? 
  - Oh, I don't need to I remember this day. 
  The photographer just couldn't believe how beautifully she could pose like that. 
  He didn't even have to tell her anything. 
  She was so nervous to have her picture taken. 
  But she was great. 
  - I've got some more. 
  She What? 
  - No, no, no. 
  Stop! 
  Just stop! 
  - What? 
  - Put the f*cking picture away! 
  - I'm just trying to show JosÃ© how cute you were. 
  - No, no, no. 
  You always do this. 
  - No, I don't. 
  - That little girl's - not here you know that, Mom. 
  - [SCOFFS] 
  - She's gone. 
  - It's okay. 
  I hate when you say that. 
  But she is, all right? 
  That little girl's dead. 
  Jesus. 
  Micah. 
  I'm sorry. 
  [JOSÃ] 
  I'm gonna [INDISTINCT CHATTER] 
  - Are you all right? 
  - I'm-I'm sorry, I'm just No, it's-it's all right. 
  Listen, there's no need - to apologize. 
  - Look, I-I wanted you to meet her, but she does this every f*cking time, and I just I thought that with you she'd be different, you know? 
  Better. 
  She's supposed to know better, right? 
  - Like - Hey. 
  Hey. 
  It's okay. 
  I see you, the person in front of me, for exactly who he is. 
  You've got me. 
  Finessing the beat that I made now I cannot see you, I'm home now I see right through you, it shows now You've got me. 
  Ooh, ooh I need you here, riding with me I need you here, riding with me I need you here, riding with me I need you here, riding with me Finessing the beat that I made now I cannot see you, I'm home now I see right through you, it shows now I cannot grow, gotta slow down Ooh, ooh Thank you for cooking. 
  It's delicious, as always. 
  Oh, well, thank you for letting me. 
  I don't get to do it often enough anymore. 
  Oh, my God, me neither. 
  [BOTH LAUGH] 
  So, how was the museum? 
  Oh, it was gorgeous.

  Everybody was staring. 
  I thought for sure we were gonna get caught. 
  [BOTH CHUCKLE]

  You know? 
  Nobody else was there.
