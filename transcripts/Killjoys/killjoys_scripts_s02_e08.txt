 Is that a... 
 Containment fence all around Old Town. 
 No one in or out. 
 You did a shitty thing, Senbek. 
 You help engineer the wall, and then they lock you inside it... why? 
 Because I asked too many stupid questions. 
 Breaking into a high-ranking officer's personal quarters and stealing Company intelligence.

 Welcome to Prodigy. 
 Khlyen's final transmission from Red 17 was sent here. 
 Guys, it was ported straight into Olan's head. 
 [grunts] 
 What's wrong, Olan? 
 I get these headaches sometimes. 
 Sometimes I see sh1t. 
 Aneela, the other me you saw in Arkyn...

 Stop it. 
 Then say it. 
 I let the team down. 
 You abandoned your team to break into Jelco's office and nearly got our license revoked. 
 How long have you been working with Pawter behind my back? 
 That's not how it started. 
 How long? 
 Pawter has her thing, which is Westerley and Old Town and walls. 
 And you, you have yours, which is Sixes and Khlyen and Sabine. 
 You're my thing, Johnny. 
 We're partners. 
 And D'Avin... we're your team. 
 But I am in love with Pawter. 
 I killed Sabine yesterday.

 You're gonna think I'm crazy. 
 And when does that stop you? 
 Okay, so Senbek said the last time a wall like this went up, all the old and weak inside died, right? 
 Yeah, she said it was like the Company was culling the herd for some creepy-ass reason. 
 Execution Eugenics. 
 Ooh, I like zero of those words. 
 It's something the Company did way back in the early colony days with animals. 
 First, contain them, then introduce a biological contaminant that will wipe out the weak... 
 [snoring] 
 And leave only the strongest stock. 
 Yeah, but these aren't animals. 
 These are people, and, oh, my God, what are you doing, woman? 
 Maybe they're building a better workforce. 
 Maybe they're gonna start exporting slaves. 
 I don't know. 
 If I'm right, the wall's a trigger and the contaminant is probably already here. 
 A poison or a virus.

 Alvis found it with an old monk in the mossipede mines. 
 He cut it from himself to leave a message.

 You've been using human skin as a bookmark. 
 You know that's creepy, right? 
 I was preserving them. 
 Look, I don't know this language. 
 Can you read it? 
 [sighs] It's Old Word. 
 On both the skin and the wall. 
 The first symbol means "Arkyn." 
 This one here means "plague." 
 After that, I'm not sure. 
 It's a map. 
 Of what? 
 They're rivers on Arkyn. 
 I felt water. 
 People drowning and screaming in pools of green. 
 Please don't go there. 
 Hey, pull your mind from the darkness. 
 Can't be Arkyn. There are no rivers there. 
 There were a couple hundred years ago. 
 That's when the 12 Scarback monks went to Arkyn to fight the devil.

 No, no, no, no, no, no, she's right. 
 No one's lost any weight. No one has. 
 How are people eating? 
 They've been walled in for weeks. 
 When Old Town ran out of cat and rat, folks started looking to trade.

 The wall from the lab is a functional match with the structure enclosing Old Town. 
 We kind of knew that. 
 Yeah, but now we know what it does. 
 Both exert a cognitive behavioral influence, including rerouting stimuli away from the thalmo-amygdala and cortico-pathways. 
 Okay, so now pretend you're not talking to Johnny. 
 It kills fear and triggers euphoria. 
 The wall acts as a giant pacifier.
