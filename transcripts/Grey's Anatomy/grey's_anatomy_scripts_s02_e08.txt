 GREY'S ANATOMY 
 2x08: Let It Be 
 Original Airdate: 11/13/2005 
 Written by: Mimi Schmir 
 Directed by: Lesli Linka Glatter ( Ferry Boat/Seattle Scene )  MVO: In the 8th grade, my English class had to read Romeo & Juliet. Then for extra credit, Mrs. Snyder made us act out all the parts.  ( Derek is on board the ferry and walks to the edge of the top deck, smiling at the sight before him )  MVO: Sal Scafarillo was Romeo. As fate would have it, I was Juliet.  ( On the deck below him, Addison is standing staring out into the ocean. She turns around and sees Derek. He finally notices her and stops smiling. Addison waves but he just walks away. Addison turns semi-upset back to look at the ocean )  MVO: All the other girls were jealous but I had a slightly different take. I told Mrs. Snyder that Juliet was an idiot.  ( Meredith is sitting in her jeep in the parking lot of SGH. Meredith is trying hid an obvious zit on her forehead by covering it with her hair, looking in her rearview mirror as a guide. A car pulls up next to her. And Addison looking as perfect as ever exits the car )  MVO: For starters, she falls for the one guy she knows she can't have. Then she blames fate for her own bad decision.  ( Addison stares at Meredith. Meredith finally realizes someone is looking at her. Addison half waves and Meredith raises her hand back forcing a smile on her face )  ( SGH )  ( Izzie and Alex are walking along an open mezzanine hallway )  IZZIE: You kissed me.  ALEX: Yes I did.  Izzie: Should we, I mean ... ( she sighs ) There's a discussion we could have, if you wanted to have one ...  Alex: Izzie I kissed you. With tongue. And I plan to do it again and again. Get used to it. End of discussion.  ( A broad smile graces Izzie's face. Alex walks off )  Izzie: Ok.  ( Meredith is sitting in her car getting a band-aid ready )  MVO: Mrs. Snyder explained to me that when fate comes into play, choice sometimes goes out the window.  ( She puts a hello kitty band-aid on her forehead to cover the zit )  Meredith: God. ( Dr. Bailey and Richard are walking down a hallway in SGH )  Richard: Congratulations.  Bailey: For what?  Richard: Fellowships. Five applications. Five offers. Do you know how rare that is? This is your year. Everybody wants to dance with you. Of course, Seattle Grace's fellowship program is the best.  Bailey ( distracted mutters ): Oh yeah. Yeah.  ( She wanders a few feet away going over a patient file. Richard disconcerted follows her )  Richard: You are taking my fellowship offer?  Bailey ( evasive ): I don't know ... I haven't made a decision yet.  ( She walks off. Richard is slightly shocked )  MVO: At the ripe old age of 13, I was very clear. That love like life is about making choices.  ( Meredith is walking in the hospital into a crowded elevator. Derek is right at the back of the elevator. A patient named Talia is having a conversation with her husband named Speed? )  Talia: I would not wish this upon anyone. Literally it's like someone reached in and ripped my guts out.  Speed: Baby you had food poisoning.  Talia: I had one lousy restaurant clam. ... Wait a minute where's billing again?  Derek & Meredith: The basement.  ( Meredith turns around and sees Derek at the back but turns back quickly )  MVO: And fate has nothing to do with it.  Talia: We're going the wrong way.  ( Seattle street where Cristina is meeting Burke on a corner. She's brought him coffee )  Cristina: Coffee? Burke: Thank you. It's date night.  Cristina: Yeah it's a night uh with a date.  Burke: You forgot.  Cristina: No. ( He looks at her ) Yesss.  Burke: You wanna cancel?  Cristina ( trying not to smile ): No.  ( They walk off together smiling )  ( George is standing a few feet away with a bagel in his hand )  MVO: Everyone thinks it's so romantic. Romeo & Juliet. True love. How sad.  ( A bird's droppings falls directly onto George's bagel startling him out of his thoughts. )  George: Oh! Crap! ( He drops the bagel onto the ground. A pigeon flies down and starts pecking at his bagel ) Sheesh!  MVO: If Juliet was stupid enough to fall for the enemy, drink a bottle of poison and go to sleep in a mausoleum ...  ( George walks away from where he was standing. Almost instantly a loud thump can be heard. It appears a guy has fallen from the sky and landed on the pavement. George is dumbfounded )  MVO: ... she deserved whatever she got.  ( OUTSIDE SGH )  ( SGH HOSPTIAL, TRAUMA ROOM ) ( Dr. Bailey and some other doctors and George are with the guy named Stu who fell lying on a hospital bed )  Bailey: Window washer. Fell from fifth floor scaffolding. Obvious open tib/fib fracture but otherwise okay.  George ( amazed ): Equal breast sounds. After a 5 storey fall he's got equal breast sounds! ( Cristina walks into the room up to Bailey ) This is unbelievable! Do you wanna hear?  Bailey: Some how I believe you. Yang, get in there and palpate his abdomen.  ( Cristina goes to do that )  Cristina: Does this hurt anywhere?  Stu: No.  George: You fell from the sky. 5 stories. And you only injured your leg.  Cristina ( disapproving ): George.  George: No. Don't George me. A few seconds there ago he would've landed on me.  Cristina: Ok rolling on three please. 1, 2, 3.  ( A bunch of doctors lift Stu onto his side. There are splattered feathers on his back as well as dried blood )  Bailey ( grossed out ): Oh.  Cristina: Are these feathers?  George: My life was saved by that pigeon.  Bailey: Let's get some x-rays. And after that you might want to get in there and look for the rest of Tweety.  George ( picking up a feather, looks at and whispers ): Thank you.  ( Meredith is talking with an elderly woman named Esme Sorrento lying in a hospital bed in a ward. Her husband Jed Sorrento is at her bedside )  Jed: Esme wanted to wait until tomorrow to see her doctor but she hasn't been able to keep anything down since yesterday so I brought her in.  Meredith: Mrs. Sorrento you have acute cholecystitis which means that your gall bladder may have to come out.  Jed: She has gall stones?  Esme ( smiling ): He watches cable; he thinks he's a doctor.  Meredith ( smiles ): I'm giving you antibiotics and IV fluids to cool the gall bladder down and then I'm gonna go call Dr. Bailey and I'm going to see if surgery is the best way for us to go. Do you have any questions?  Esme ( looking at the band-aid ): Honey what happened to your forehead?  Meredith ( shakes her head ): Nothing.  ( The nurse's station where an agitated guy named Weiss is talking to one of the nurse's )  Weiss: I've already told you I don't need an appointment. I'm not a patient; I am a friend from New York.  ( Derek sees the guy talking to the nurse )  Derek: Weiss?  Weiss: Derek! I've been looking for you.  ( Addison is walking down an open hallway, meeting a blonde woman named Savannah nicknamed Savvy )  Addison ( opens up her arms ): Sav!  Savvy: Oh it's good to see you.  ( They hug tightly )  Addison: Oh why didn't you tell me you were coming? ( They finally stop hugging ) If I knew you were coming I would've taken the day off.  Savvy: Well it was kinda last minute.  Addison: Is everything okay? Are you alright?  ( Derek & Weiss are chatting in an empty staff/conference room sitting at table with cups of coffee )  Weiss: A month ago her mother died. Ovarian cancer.  Derek: Katherine died? ( Weiss nods ) I'm sorry.  Weiss: That's Savvy, she's... I mean you know how close they were. I mean all she could think about was this breast and ovarian cancer gene.  Derek: BRACA.  ( Addison is talking with Savvy in a similar room as before. Addison is looking over Savvy's file )  Addison: A positive test result isn't the end of the world Sav. It just means that you have a gene mutation that could ...  Savvy ( interrupts softly ): I know what it is. I've talked to the genetic counselor. I've been to my gynecologist ... and now I'm here. ( Addison sits back. Savvy sits down across from her pleading ) Addie, you're the best surgeon there is.  Addison ( smiles ): True. ( They both chuckle ) But this isn't surgical.  Savvy: Yes it is.  Addison: No Sav, you understand you don't have cancer.  Savvy: And I have no intention of getting it.  ( Addison stares at her quietly )  Addison ( shakes her head slightly ): So you want me ...  Savvy: I want you to take out my ovaries and the uterus. And when that's done ... you're gonna find the best person out there to cut off my breasts.  ( Trauma room where Stu is now lying on his stomach. Cristina & George are removing bits of the splattered pigeon from Stu's back )  Stu: Beak?  George & Cristina: Claw.  Cristina: We need to widen this incision to take a better look.  George: Alright. ( George bends down close to Stu and speaks softly ) Does your leg hurt a lot?  Stu: I'm fine man. Just ... do your thing.  ( George goes back briefly to removing feathers but then leans back down )  George: Is there anyone you'd like me to call?  Stu ( sighs ): What for?  George: You fell 5 stories and lived to tell about it. I'd kinda wanna shout it from the roof tops. ( Cristina gives him a look ) So to speak. ( Speaks excitedly now ) It's a miracle! You may not understand the medicine of it but a 5 story fall, your lungs should be collapsed, your back should be broken, your aorta should be totally severed ...  Cristina ( interrupts quietly ): George, enough!  George ( whispers quietly to Stu who groans ): I'm just saying there's a reason for this. You lived! We both did. Carpe diem man! Seize the day.  Stu ( to Cristina ): Any chance you could make him leave?  Cristina: I really, really wish I could.  ( Dr. Bailey enters with some x-rays of Stu's legs )  Bailey: Mr. Vargas, your lower left leg bones are shattered. We need to get you into surgery.  Stu: Oh great just my luck.  Cristina ( holds up the beak ): Beak.  George ( amazed to Stu ): Could I? Would you mind? Could I keep that?  ( Stu gives him a look )  ( Savvy, Addison, & Weiss are all sitting together at a table. Izzie is standing at the doorway watching )  Savvy: My mother died of it. My aunt. My cousin! She's 37, has ovarian cancer.  Weiss: But you don't. You don't have cancer! This is crazy Sav.  Savvy: But I have the gene Weiss ...  ( Derek walks into the room )  Addison ( interrupts ): which gives her up to an 85% chance of getting cancer Weiss.  Derek: And a 15% chance she won't.  Addison: What are you invited? Savvy: I'm not betting my life on 15%!  Derek: Weiss asked me to come.  ( Derek kisses Savvy's head and sits down next to Weiss )  Weiss: I thought it might help.  Savvy: Help what? ( to Derek ) I'm sorry Derek, cause I love you and I'm really glad to see you but until you grow a uterus and watch your mother die from this disease you don't get ... you don't get a vote.  Derek ( to Addison ): She tell you that they were trying to get pregnant?  Addison: Yes she did.  Derek: Having a hysterectomy is gonna throw a wrench into that.  Savvy ( adamant ): Derek! We've been trying for months.  Weiss: Why give up now?  Savvy: Come on. We've talked about this. There are other ways to make a family Weiss. We can adopt, we can do ...  Weiss ( interrupts ): Savvy I just ...  Savvy ( interrupts angry ): No. NO! I'm not talking about this!  Derek: Let's just take a step back. Take a deep breath and think about this.  ( He gives Addison a look who gives him one back annoyed )  Savvy: I've already thought about it Derek. This ... this is going to happen.  ( Addison grabs Savvy's patient chart )  Addison ( she hands it to Izzie ): Dr. Stevens get a complete history and her pre-op labs. Get her scheduled for a double mastectomy and consult Dr. Quenar from plastics for a reconstruction.  Weiss ( upset ): Derek.  Derek: Addison this conversation is not over!  Addison: This ... She is my patient Derek! Doing a bilateral prophylactic oophorectomy and hysterectomy tomorrow. ( Izzie looks amazed at what is going on. To Izzie ) Get moving.  ( Derek & Addison are walking down a hallway together )  Derek: Prophylactic surgery is extreme.  Addison ( sighs angry ): This is has nothing to do with you. Why were you even in there? She came to me for medical consultation Derek. I'm her doctor. Me.  Derek: Those are some of our closest friends. This isn't medical, it is personal.  Addison: Fine. Okay if it's personal we should be dealing with them as a couple. Acting like a couple.  Derek: What? What does that mean?  Addison ( she holds up her wedding ring on her hand ): See the ring?  Derek ( angry ): Don't go to the ring!  Addison: The ring Derek! Remember? We're, we're hear at work you won't talk to me or on the ferry where you pretend not to see me or in couple's therapy 3 times a week where we're arguing about whether or not we should be in couple's therapy. What are we doing?  Derek: This is not about us.  Addison: It is! Medicine aside our friends are going through hell in there and we can't even act like we like each other long enough to help them.  ( Derek shakes his head and Addison walks off )  ( Esme is still lying in bed with her husband now sitting on a chair beside her bed holding her hand. Meredith is trying to insert an IV drip into her other arm )  Esme: What's that other that's monogamous?  Jed ( smiles ): I think it's bulls.  Esme ( to Meredith ): Oh I know it's hard. I'm a pin cushion.  Meredith: It's okay, don't worry. I won't stick until I find a good one.  Jed ( to Meredith ): Otters mate for life you know.  Meredith: Excuse me?  Esme: As do bulls I suppose.  Meredith: Okay I got it. Hold still. It's gonna take a second for the tube to fill.  Esme: Hmm I've always like otters.  Meredith: I've always been more of a dog person myself.  ( Esme laughs )  ( George and Meredith are at a nurse's desk. Cristina comes to the desk as well )  George ( excited ): Shouldn't he be more excited? Maybe he's in shock, I dunno. But I mean he survived! It's huge! He's gotta realize that things happen for a reason.  Meredith: Oh yeah my ex-boyfriend moved his wife to Seattle. Reason: To torture me.  George: I'm serious.  Meredith: So am I.  Cristina: What's with the 'Hello Kitty' on your forehead?  Meredith: I don't want to talk about it.  Cristina: George can I sign out to you early?  George: You don't want in on Stu's surgery?  Cristina: Can't. I have a test date. ( She lowers her voice ) Burke is testing me. ( She returns to a normal level ) Plus I've already spent an hour picking bird parts out of the guy. I'm over it.  George: Carpe diem.  Meredith: Giant zit on my forehead and I'm beginning to look how I feel. Carpe that.  George ( loud & jubilant ): This is the luckiest day in the world!  Cristina: Tell that to the bird.  ( Izzie is putting a bandage on Savvy's arm after an injection. Savvy is lying in a hospital bed in a gown. Alex is there as well writing in Savvy's chart. Savvy is staring at Izzie )  Savvy: Is it the kid thing? I saw your face upstairs. It's the kid thing for most people. ( To herself ) And the breasts. Oh and the total menopause like overnight.  Izzie: It's a big step.  Alex: Well I think it's brave.  Savvy: Thank you. ( To Izzie ) And yes I'd love to be pregnant. I want a lot of things. I wanna ... sky dive. I'd like to learn Italian. I wanna go to San Tropez with my husband and lie topless on the beach.  ( Izzie smiles )  Alex: They do excellent implants in reconstruction these days. ( Izzie loses the smile instantly ) You won't even know the difference. Plus you'll never have to wear a bra again. That's something right?  ( Savvy laughs )  Izzie ( annoyed ): Alex, didn't I see your service on the OR board for a biopsy right about now?  Alex: Yeah.  ( He leaves )  Izzie: It's not the kid thing.  Savvy: Ok. What? ( Izzie is silent ) It's not like I have a lot of options. One, take my chances and never get cancer. Two, take my chances and die young.  Izzie: There's a third option you know?  Savvy: Ok I'm listening.  Izzie: Take your chances, get cancer and fight like hell to survive.  ( She leaves the room )  ( Staff Locker room. Cristina is trying on various dresses. She is wearing a red dress over her scrubs. She holds up a light purple dress and pale white flowery one to Izzie to look at )  Izzie: Ah they're both really nice.  Cristina: I know. I bought them. But which one is right?  ( She holds the white one over head and stands in front of a full length mirror to see how it looks. The mirror is between two doors leading to respective female & male bathrooms )  Izzie: For what? You're gonna look hot in either one.  Cristina: Well clearly. That's not the point.  ( Meredith & George enter. George whistles )  Meredith: Wow you look hot.  Cristina: Yeah. Burke and I are gonna talk about how hot I am over dinner. This date is such a mistake.  ( Cristina starts taking off the red dress )  George: But it's easy to get nervous on dates. It's especially hard if you're out of practice so you just got be mellow ...  Cristina ( interrupts ): Yeah I know how to date George. I'm not you.  ( Alex has entered the room as well. George goes into the men's bathroom )  Alex: I have a scheduled for the mastectomy. And I get to stay while plastics does a TRAM flap reconstruction.  Izzie: I couldn't do it.  Alex: Do what? Make yourself all hot and sexy for your boyfriend like Yang?  ( Cristina is now putting on the purple dress )  Cristina: Go wrestle something.  Izzie: I couldn't cut off my ovaries and breasts just because I might have cancer.  ( Cristina yanks up the dress fully and walks up to Meredith to zip her up )  Cristina: Think of it like a hand. If someone told you you'd die if you didn't chop off your hand you'd do it.  Izzie: Except when you chop off a hand you don't kill your s*x drive, have silicone breasts, get hot flushes and lose your ability to bear children.  ( Cristina pulls of her scrub pants )  Meredith: If it were me I wouldn't even have the test. I mean what's the point? We're all gonna die anyway right? ( They all stare at her ) It's the 'Hello Kitty' band-aid on my forehead. It's freaking me out.  Alex: I say slice 'em and dice 'em. Whatever. They're body parts.  ( Cristina moves back to the mirror and starts putting on some black heels )  Izzie: So you'd cut of your pen1s?  Alex: If it kept me from dying. Besides, I've got plenty of spare.  ( Izzie makes a face and Alex leaves )  Cristina ( looks all ready to go ): I can do hot in my sleep. I look hot in scrubs. I'm a hot person. He's seen my naked a thousand times.  ( George walks out of the bathroom at this very sentence and closes his eyes painfully )  George ( to himself ): Bad, bad images in my head.  Meredith: But he's never seen you outside the hospital.  Cristina ( sarcastic ): Thank you.  ( SGH Parking lot at night )  ( Burke & Cristina are walking to his car all dressed up ready for their date )  Burke: You look lovely.  Cristina: Thanks.  ( She quickens her pace a little and goes to open the door for herself but Burke reaches for the door simultaneously )  Cristina: Oh. Very polite. Thank you. ( He opens the door for her and she gets in. Burke closes the door and walks to the other side of the door trying to shake of his nerves )  ( Esme is in an operating room. Bailey & Meredith are operating on her )  Bailey: Ok, Grey. Adhesions are down. What next?  Meredith: Put in graspers to lift the gall bladder so we can dissect it out.  Bailey: Good and what are we looking for in Calot's triangle?  Meredith: The cystic artery.  Bailey: That's right. ( looking at the screen of the surgery ) Wait a minute. What do you see?  Meredith ( sighs ): Porcelin bladder.  Bailey: That's not good.  ( Dr. Bailey & Meredith are talking with Jed after the surgery in a waiting room )  Bailey: Mr. Sorrento when we removed your wife's gallbladder we found that there were calcifications.  Jed: What does that mean?  Bailey: It's often a sign of gallbladder cancer. We sent it off to Pathology.  Jed: She has cancer?  Bailey: I'm afraid so. We can keep her comfortable but she's going to need more tests to see what our next steps are. This might include more surgery.  Jed: But this surgery will save her right?  Bailey: The cancer appears to be advanced. There a palliative surgeries that we can do, that is surgeries to help with the pain but it won't cure it.  Jed ( devastated looks through the window into the ward his wife is in ): How longs she got?  Bailey: From what we can tell so far ... she has about 4 to 6 months. I'm so sorry.  ( Dr. Bailey walks away. Meredith sad moves to walk away as well but Mr. Sorrento stops her )  Jed: I don't want Esme to know.  Meredith: What?  Jed: Esme, I don't want her to know she's dying.  Meredith: You don't want to tell her?  Jed: Please. You saw her. She's happy. Let me take her home. I don't want her to be afraid before she dies. She doesn't need to.  ( Pre-op ward where Stu is lying in a hospital bed waiting for his surgery. George is at his bedside. George moves to speak )  Stu: No, please don't. No more carpe diem, man. I don't wanna seize the day.  George: See that's what I don't get. I'm standing here and I'm just so incredibly happy to be alive. You know I'm looking at the sky, its bluer. Food tastes better. And I didn't survive a 5 story fall.  ( Stu looks away at this upset. George stops writing in his chart, the smile sliding of his face. Realization dawns him )  George ( says as a statement ): You jumped didn't you.  ( Stu doesn't reply )  ( SGH HOSPITAL AT NIGHT )  ( SGH PRE-OP WARD ) Stu: The whole way down all I could think about was Daisy. She's my ex-girl. She works in this hospital. ( He huffs ) What kinda joke is that?  George: Maybe, maybe you got a second chance.  Stu ( suddenly more upbeat ): Daisy. You gotta go and find her for me. Talk to her. Tell her she's the reason that I'm alive.  ( George just stares back )  ( Weiss is sitting on an empty hospital gurney against the wall of a hallway. Derek is leaning against the wall talking to him )  Weiss ( upset ): You know we had a future. We had plans. We picked out baby names together. She betrayed that ... without even asking my opinion. Without even giving me time to process.  Derek: It's a difficult time. For both of you. She's emotional.  Weiss: And hormone changes. Mood swings. They say she could lose her s*x drive.  Derek: You'll get through this, all right? ( He sits down next to Weiss ) you'll get through this. You guys love each other.  Weiss: Is that what you said about you and Addie?  Derek: What?  Weiss: You left her.  Derek: That was different.  Weiss: Was it Derek? Really?  Derek: You know, I gotta go check on a patient and get ready for dinner. See you later.  ( He gets up and walks off )  Weiss: Sure.  ( RESTAURANT WITH A LOBSTER ON THE FRONT AT NIGHT ) ( RESTAURANT ) ( Cristina & Burke are sitting at a table for 2 looking over the menus. Cristina starts looking at the table for something )  Cristina: Uh, where's the butter? ( Burke picks up a bottle of olive oil and holds it out to her ) Oh, no, that's olive oil. I want butter.  ( He nods slightly and puts the olive oil down. A waiter comes up to their table )  Waiter: Should I send the sommelier over?  Burke: Oh no that won't be necessary. What is a nice oaky chardonnay?  Cristina: Oh I want Bordeaux  Burke: Chardonnay will be better with the lobster.  Cristina: I'm having steak.  Burke ( a little shocked ): You...You eat red meat.  Cristina ( equally shocked ): You don't?  ( They both look over their respective menus while the waiter waits for their order )  ( SGH ) ( George is looking over a map of the hospital with Meredith in an elevator by themselves )  Meredith: You're seriously gonna try to find this girl? Hunt her down while she's working.  George: Look. ... Ok I know it's crazy but someone's gotta tell her how he feels. I mean he's alive, right? Something good has got to come out of this. ( Meredith nods slight ) I mean this could change everything. See I dunno I thought you were a romantic.  ( The elevator door dings )  Meredith: Was. Past tense.  ( The doors open and Derek enters )  Derek: Well this is fun, again. I like the 'Hello Kitty' by the way. Very pink. Very cheerful.  George ( uncomfortable ): Daisy works is billing which is where?  Derek and Meredith: In the basement.  ( George nods to himself and makes a funny noise. Meredith & Derek both turn to look at him )  ( Dr. Bailey is in front of the OR board looking tearful? Richard comes to the edge of a corner near the board and Bailey notices )  Bailey: You need something Chief? I have one more surgery and then I'm free.  Richard: No, no, no.  Bailey: Ok.  ( She starts walking off. Richard starts walking with her )  Richard: Have you made a decision yet?  Bailey: Sir?  Richard: The fellowship. The Seattle Grace fellowship. I thought you would've accepted by now.  Bailey: Busy. I've just haven't had a chance to fill out ...  Richard ( interrupts ): We're a private hospital. We have extensive resources. You'll get more surgical experience here than anywhere else. You could write your own ticket. Why aren't you more excited?  Bailey: No I'm excited. I just ... I'm, excuse me sir, I just I need to scrub in.  ( RESTAURANT ) ( Restaurant where Burke & Cristina are eating their dinner silently )  Cristina: What?  Burke: Oh, nothing.  Cristina: You know, we should probably skip dessert I have, I have an early morning.  Burke: Oh, right. Not a problem.  ( A guy in a far by table collapses. It is Speed earlier from before in the elevator )  Talia: Oh, my god, help is there a doctor in here?  ( Both Cristina & Burke look over. They both jump up )  Cristina & Burke: Yes! ( Cristina & Burke are checking over the guy collapsed on the floor )  Cristina: Call 911.  Talia: He couldn't be having heartburn. I thought he was choking.  Burke: Pulse?  Cristina: Yes it's rapid and unequal.  Burke: Look at this. The length of his fingers.  Cristina: He's gotta be at least 6 foot 4.  Burke & Cristina: Marfan's.  Talia: What do his fingers have to do with anything?  Cristina: Your husband is showing classic markers for Marfan's syndrome.  Burke: It means the walls of his blood vessels are weak.  Cristina: Uh we need an ambulance.  Burke: Fast. He could be dissected here and then get him to the O.R.  Cristina: Before his aorta ruptures?  Talia: What are you talking about? Who are you people?  ( Paramedics are with the guy on a stretcher in the restaurant. Dr. Burke is with them. Cristina is on the phone to the hospital )  Cristina: We have a dissected thoracic aorta. We need a CT cleared and an O.R ready.  ( They start wheeling the guy out of the restaurant )  Burke ( to the paramedics ): Start another large boar IV. Continue high flow O2. Transport him sirens and lights to Seattle Grace.  Paramedic: Who the hell are you?  Cristina: Hey! He's the cardiothoracic surgeon who's gonna operate on him.  Burke ( looking pleased ): And she's with me.  ( SGH ) ( Savvy is putting make-up on, getting ready for a night out. Izzie walks into her room )  Izzie: Oh, I didn't ... have you been discharged?  Savvy: Wh? No. I'm going out to dinner with my surgeon and our husbands. Sort of a last supper I guess. I know, I know. Nothing after midnight. ( Izzie nods and moves to leave ) You're disappointed aren't you? ( Izzie stops and turns back ) How do I look?  Izzie: You're a beautiful woman.  Savvy: And so are you. ( Izzie half shrugs it off looking down ) Is that why this is so hard to understand? Ugh menopause I know. Boobs. But they have hormone replacement, reconstructions. ( She gets reflective ) But the sexy Savvy. The Savvy that gets noticed when she walks into the room. Hmmm. The Savvy that loves to wake her husband up in the middle of the night to make love. Yeah I wonder if that Savvy is still gonna be there. Honestly I haven't a clue. ( Izzie is silent ) But then I think is, is that why Weiss married me? God, I hope not.  ( George is running down some stairs to the basement of the hospital. He sees a sign pointing to Billings and he runs down the hall. He stops in front of an open door. A woman is sitting at a desk )  George: Could this place be any further away? It's like Siberia down here.  Daisy: That's because we don't like sick people.  George: Oh. You know you're, you're in a hospital. Uh, are you Daisy?  Daisy: I don't deal with billing questions after 7pm. I'm just data entry at night.  George: No uh actually Stu sent me.  Daisy: Is this some kinda joke?  George: No. He's in this hospital. He's had an accident. I'm his doctor. He's fine. Uh we're taking him into surgery. Um but he wanted me to find you.  ( George smiles )  Daisy: You just tell that b*st*rd he could've come looking for me like 10 years ago.  ( George looks a little stunned by her response & walks out )  ( Izzie & Alex are sitting in a gallery watching Stu's surgery about to begin. Izzie looks angry )  Alex: What are you pissed about?  Izzie: You'll look at everything in a skirt.  Alex ( teasing ): I'd look at you in a skirt. Short. Maybe something school girl. Pleated. Izzie: If that skirt didn't have a pair of big bouncy boobs you'd stop looking.  Alex: When you cut them off you build them back up. Maybe you get to upgrade. Life goes on.  Izzie ( whispers angrily ): If there was a genetic test for testicular cancer, you think men who tested positive would have the surgery? No. You know why? It's castration. What man would willingly get rid of the part of his anatomy that makes him a man? This woman is having herself castrated and we book an OR and act like it means nothing! It's not nothing. God. How could possibly act like it's no big deal? I mean what if it was me?  Alex: Izzie, you're making... You're freaking out. You know that right?  Izzie: If I was the woman with the cancer gene. If I should up tomorrow and my boobs were made of plastic and my skin had aged 10 years and my s*x drive had dried up. If it was me Alex would you be so fine with it then? ( Alex is silent ) Yeah you'd really be hot to kiss me with tongue then, wouldn't you?  ( Izzie gets up and leaves very upset )  ( OR where Stu is lying down. George is in there as well )  Anesthesiologist: Dr. Bailey's scrubbing in so we're gonna get started.  Stu: Okay. Hey George. Listen, did you find her?  George: I'm very sorry Stu. They said she's on vacation.  Stu: Oh, yeah? Maybe her parents. I bet you she went up to New Hampshire. That's where she's from.  Anesthesiologist: I'm gonna push the joy juice.  Stu: Oh up, up and away.  ( The anesthesiologist chuckles )  George: Maybe you can see her after your surgery. You know when you recover. Maybe then.  Stu: It's all good man. Thanks for trying. ( He starts trailing off ) It really meant a ... lot ... to ... me.  ( Stu's heart monitor starts beeping rapidly )  Anesthesiologist: Hold on guys. We have a problem.  George: He's crashing? Dr. Bailey?  Bailey: O'Malley start CPR. ( To another doctor ) Push Epi.  ( George and Dr. Bailey are walking out of the OR )  Bailey: You'll need to notify the family.  George: What happened?  Bailey: There'll be an autopsy. Sometimes people get on the table and they just die. There's no way of knowing beforehand and no way of controlling it.  George: But he fell 5 stories and lived. It doesn't make any sense. He survived so I could go and find Daisy. And then she didn't even want to see him so what's the point?  Bailey: We're all part of the cosmic joke O'Malley. Now leave me alone.  ( She wanders to the OR board where Meredith rushes up to her )  Meredith: Oh, Dr. Bailey.  Bailey ( loud ): What?  Meredith: Mr. Sorrento doesn't want me to tell his wife that she's dying.  Bailey ( yells ): You haven't told her yet?  Meredith: No.  Bailey: Ok, I didn't hear you say that. You're her doctor. It's your responsibility to give your patients the information necessary to make an informed decision. Now, I'm hungry. I'm tired. You're in my way!  ( She brushes past Meredith )  
 
 ( Cristina & Burke are washing up in the scrub room getting ready to perform surgery on Speed )  Burke: Can you see that Echo from here?  Cristina: The dissection isn't subtle.  Burke: Did you see that wingspan? And the pectus carinatum?  Cristina: What about his palate?  Burke: The definition of high arched.  ( They walk into the OR )  ( Dr. Bailey is in staff room eating a piece of chocolate cake and coffee. Richard comes in )  Richard: You're being wooed, aren't you?  Bailey: Excuse me?  Richard: The fellowship. LA Med, Chicago Central. They're wooing you. I mean you're fielding offers, you're looking at bonus packages, you're letting yourself be wooed.  Bailey ( looking a little shocked ): No, Chief I ...  Richard ( interrupts ): No it's fine! It's fine. Go be a hotshot somewhere else.  ( He goes to a table and makes himself a cup of coffee and comes back a little upset )  Richard: But tell me ... how could you do this to me? I mean, I'm hurt. Really hurt. After all I've done for you. You're gifted and you're ungrateful. And that's all I'm saying.  Bailey ( annoyed ): I'm pregnant, you blind moron.  Richard ( shocked and looking sheepish ): You're what?  Bailey: My heart rate is 110. I'm burning 3000 calories a day. My legs are swollen. I've got indigestion and gas. Did you know that carrying a boy in your uterus means you burn 10% more calories than if you had a girl? Guess what I'm carrying! I try for 7 damn years and a month before my fellowship notifications the stick turns blue. Men! From the very beginning they just suck the life right out of you. I'm not leaving. I'm pregnant.  Richard: Um ... congratulations.  ( Burke & Cristina are in the O.R about to perform surgery on Jed )  Burke: Dr. Yang. ... You're handling the saw.  ( Cristina looks amazed. Other scrub nurses look at her also amazed )  Cristina: Thank you, Dr. Burke. ( She whispers to him ) You won't let me pick the wine but this you'll let me do?  Burke ( he chuckles ): Are we all set for by-pass?  Nurse: Almost there.  ( Cristina begins using the saw while Dr. Burke watches her carefully )  ( Meredith is entering an empty elevator. Well except for Derek who's dressed for dinner standing in a corner typing something into his mobile. The doors ding shut )  Derek: So, apparently we both live on this elevator.  ( Meredith doesn't reply. He shuts his phone and walks to face her. She avoids looking at him )  Derek: Meredith. You know, you could at least acknowledge I exist.  ( The door dings open and Addison is waiting to get on. Derek turns around so his back is facing Meredith and Addison enters the elevator )  Addison: Hello, Dr. Grey.  Meredith: Hello.  Addison ( to Derek ): You ready to go?  Derek: I was on my way.  ( There is an awkward silence )  ( Talia is waiting in a patient waiting room. Dr. Burke & Cristina come down some stairs after the surgery to talk to Talia )  Burke: Well, it took 3 hours but the surgery went perfectly. ( Cristina nods smiling ) All we have to do is wait now and see how he's doing when he wakes up.  Talia: Why did this happen?  Burke: Almost every patient with Marfan's has an aorta that fails. It's just a matter of when.  Talia: I guess it was lucky you two were having dinner at the next table.  ( Cristina & Burke exchange looks )  Burke: It was. Take care.  ( They walk away )  ( Meredith is talking to Mrs. Sorrento by herself in her patient room about her cancer )  Meredith: ... and we can treat it with surgery and chemo but ...  Esme: We're supposed to go to Venice at the end of the month. Do you know the story?  Meredith: No.  Esme: They say if you ride a gondola under the Bridge of Sighs, you're together for eternity. You didn't tell Jed, did you?  Meredith: Excuse me?  Esme: He's always been so worried that I'd go first.  Meredith: You don't want him to know?  Esme: You're young. I don't expect you to understand an old broad like me.  Meredith: You can't have a relationship built on a lie. Can you?  Esme: Oh, honey, it's not a lie. It's our future. I've been with the love of my life for 60 years. And now I'm dying. We're going to Venice. We're getting in that gondola.  ( Meredith smiles )  ( Seattle Scenes ) ( JOE'S BAR ) ( Addison, Derek, Savvy & Weiss are sitting in a booth together having a few drinks )  Savvy: When Addie told me she was coming out here. I had such a good feeling. You guys are gonna make it. You were always meant to be.  Weiss: Yeah a couple of clams on a half shell. A couple of peas in a pod.  ( Addison chuckles )  Addison: Hmm.  Derek: Still working on the pod part.  Addison: It's about choices.  ( Savvy holds up her coke for a toast )  Savvy: We'll here's to taking life in your own hands.  Addison: Cheers.  Savvy: Cheers.  Derek: Cheers.  Weiss ( upset ): Yeah. And here's to bull and here's to crap. And here's to oophorectomy, hysterectomy, double bilateral mastectomy.  Savvy: Please stop.  Weiss: How smart am I to know all those words?  Savvy: Stop.  Weiss: Here's to breast reconstruction, nipple reconstruction. Here's to losing your wife. Here's to being the ass who can't be supportive. Here's to that.  ( He gets up and leaves )  ( SGH HOSPITAL GROUND FLOOR WAITING ROOM )  ( Weiss is sitting in one the chairs. Derek walks in )  Derek: Weiss? Weiss: Don't talk to me. Keep walking.  Derek: You should get some sleep. Sober up. So you're ready for Savvy's surgery. Come on I'll drive you.  Weiss: I'm supposed to hold her hand while they rip her apart? That's the definition of love?  ( Derek sighs and sits down facing him )  Derek: You can do this.  Weiss: Maybe I can't. Maybe I'm just a guy who likes to screw his wife.  Derek ( shakes his head ): Weiss.  Weiss: And that's what she'll think if I'm not there.  Derek: You're gonna be there.  Weiss ( chuckles ): This is coming from a guy who packed his bags in the middle of the night and drove 3,000 miles to live in a trailer.  Derek: Yeah well what am I doing with Addison now? Hmmm? I'm trying to work it out. I don't know am I out of my, my mind? I don't know. You tell me? ... It's about the ring. It's about the vows. Savvy didn't screw around with you with your best friend. She's looking for support. If you don't give that to her now, if you don't give her that support, then what the hell am I doing?  ( Weiss just shakes his head )  ( Meredith is walking out of Mrs. Sorrento's room. Mr. Sorrento is standing in front of the door about to enter with a cup of coffee )  Jed: You didn't tell her, did you?  Meredith: No. I didn't tell her.  ( He nods his thanks and walks in to the room with the coffee for his wife. She smiles and takes it. Meredith watches ) ( Seattle Scenes )  ( Meredith is sitting on a low concrete wall in what could possibly be the backyard to the townhouse. George is pacing up and down along the wall )  George: I thought he cheated fate.  Meredith: Maybe he did cheat fate.  George: He died.  Meredith: I think you can't wait for someone to fly underneath you and save your life. I think you have to save yourself.  George: You mean the pigeons aren't going to come?  Meredith: The pigeons aren't going to come.  ( Addison is sitting on Savvy's bed with a Polaroid camera taking photo's of Savvy who's sitting opposite her on the bed doing provocative poses with nothing but a red gown )  Addison: Hold still.  ( She takes the photo and they both laugh )  Savvy: Make sure you get both sides.  Addison: Okay.  Savvy ( smiling ): You know these are gonna be next year's holiday cards. ( Addison laughs and takes another picture ) I want them to be immortalized before they're gone. And this way Weiss gets to look at them whenever he wants.  ( Addison takes another picture )  Addison: These are gonna be great.  Savvy: We're scheduled to go in at 8?  Addison: Yeah. I'm gonna take you down to the pre-op in just a few minutes.  Savvy: Weiss will show up, Addie he always does.  Addison ( slightly teary ): Sav. ... As your doctor you know I'm a 100% on your side but ... as your friend are you absolutely sure about this?  Savvy ( sighs ): I know what I'm losing. I get it. But think about what I'm gaining. My life. This gives me a shot. A shot at the future. At shot at me and Weiss ... becoming this crazy old wrinkled couple that argues all the time. I mean, wouldn't you want that? A chance to grow old with Derek?  Addison ( teary ): Yeah. ... Yeah I do.  Savvy: Oh god.  ( She starts crying )  Addison: Oh Sav.  ( Addison comforts her )  MVO: Maybe Romeo & Juliet were fated to be together, but just for a while. And then their time passed.  ( Izzie is sitting on a bench tying up her shoe laces in the deserted staff locker room. Alex walks into the room )  MVO: If they could've known that beforehand maybe it would've all been ok.  ( Alex sits behind Izzie )  Alex: Here's the thing. I like your rack.  Izzie ( interrupts standing up angry ): What is wrong with you? Why do you have to be so ... What is wrong with you?  ( Alex pulls her down back onto the bench )  Alex: I like your rack. And I'd want them around if I could have them, trust me I would. But it wouldn't be the end of the world if you got rid of them. Because really ... I'd want you.  ( Izzie slaps him across the face hard )  Alex: Ow. Huh. What was that for?  MVO: I told Mrs. Snyder that when I was growing up I'd take fate into my own hands.  ( Izzie grabs Alex's face and kisses him )  MVO: I wouldn't let some guy drag me down.  ( Izzie gets up and smiles walking off )  ( Mrs. Sorrento is being wheeled to the elevator. Mr. Sorrento is beside her. Mrs. Sorrento gets up and they walk together arm in arm into the elevator. Camera pans to Meredith who is watching them from the next floor above )  MVO: Mrs. Snyder said that I'd be lucky if I ever had that kind of passion with someone. And that if I did, we'd be together forever.  ( Cristina & Burke are walking down a hall towards the same set of elevators. One of them dings open )  Burke: I guess we never really got our date.  Cristina: Are you kidding? That was the best date I've ever been on.  ( She gets onto the elevator smiling and the doors closes. Dr. Burke walks off grinning )  MVO: Even now I believe for the most part love is about choices.  ( Savvy is lying on an operating table in the O.R. Addison is there as well prepping for the surgery. Derek walks in scrubbed up and walks up to Savvy. Savvy tries not to cry )  Savvy: He's not coming is he?  ( Derek smiles with his eyes and moves to the side so you can see the door. Weiss walks in scrubbed up in dark blue scrubs up to Savvy )  Weiss: You're shaking.  Savvy ( trying not to cry, happy ): You're here.  ( Izzie is there as well prepped up. Addison takes a glance at Derek who looks back )  MVO: It's about putting down the poison and the dagger and making your own happy ending ... most of the time.  Addison ( to Izzie ): I'm going to go ahead and get started now. ( To Savvy ) You ready?  Savvy ( smiling at Weiss ): Yeah. Ready.  ( Weiss is holding Savvy's hand tightly )  ( Elevator dings open and Meredith is standing outside waiting to get on. She looks up and sees Derek by himself looking down leaning against the back wall of the elevator )  MVO: And that sometimes despite all your best choices and all your best intentions, fate wins anyway.  ( He looks up and sees Meredith but is silent. Meredith walks in and turns around so she isn't facing him. The doors shut. There is a quiet silence )  Meredith ( softly ): I miss you.  ( Derek perks up slightly at this. He stands up slowly and walks up to right behind Meredith and smells her hair. He pulls back but then slightly rests his head against hers briefly. Meredith closes her eyes at the contact. He moves close and whispers in her ear )  Derek: I can't.  ( He walks out of the elevator. And the doors close on Meredith )
