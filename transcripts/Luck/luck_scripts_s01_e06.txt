 There's five in there from the owner. 
 Split this with that bug. 
 Turo. 
 I can't believe I'm off that horse. 
 Yesterday I gave my book to my new agent. 
 Hey, honey. I've been missing you a lot lately. 
 Lynn :  Leave a message. 
 ( Beeps ) 
 You the person having trouble getting s*x? 
 Morning, pops. 
 Might as well run him, huh? 
 You ready to run today? 
 Yes! 
 Come back tomorrow. Tell me everything you did between now and then. 
 If I like what I hear, I'll give you $1 million to work for me. 
 What am I going to be doing to earn my keep? 
 You're gonna meet somebody. 
 Your horse idea, buy a big race track, bring in casino gaming. 
 I still don't know how you ever got involved with Mike. 
 You claim the dope and you do the time. 
 I wonder if you mightn't be pissed off. 
 ( Whinnies ) 
 Oh, God, he's bleeding. Right hind. 
 The jock should pull him up. 
 He is still running. 
 That is some wonderful horse. 
 Now pray he come out in one piece. 
 We'll do the ultrasound in the morning. 
 You're gonna stay here? 
 I'm fine.

 Good morning, sir. 
 Want me to order you some breakfast? 
 Morning, Mr. Bernstein, Mr. Demitriou. 
 Morning. How are you? 
 Hi, kid. How you doing? 
 Good, good. 
 Do you want me to order you some breakfast? 
 How long, my time in Siberia? 
 I asked you to drive that woman home... 
 I did it. 
 And then go home to sleep yourself. 
 I took a nice little snooze while I was in the car waiting for you. 
 Come on. 
 Patient, well-mannered gentleman, that horse. 
 Studies you up so close, he could take a bite off your cheek, and instead he just breathes on you. 
 And we get the purse for the win. 
 Israel. 
 All right, we got a lot to do. 
 Israel there, I gotta give his final marching papers, the parole guy I gotta see, even before I go see the boss at the track. Get in. 
 Morning, gentlemen. 
 Come on. 
 Congratulations on the win. 
 Yeah. 
 Greatest f*cking country in the world. 
 ( People laughing ) 
 ( No audible dialogue ) Renzo : To any of our foray stable racing team who might be interested, which I would say especially our trainer and all his assistants in his barn... Ahem, grooms. Grooms. And the doctor... Veterinarian. Who she's taken such wonderful care of Mon Gateau since before we even owned him... you know, this ain't the goddamn Oscars. We brought out t-shirts for everybody to wear optionally, in our horse's race this afternoon. So if... ( Crying ) Bad news, probably. Maybe a wrong number. Loaded for bear tomorrow, Mr. Smith? Woman :  Okay, thank you for calling Santa Anita. There's a letter for you in the mail room, Mr. Smith. Your colt going to air on 'em like the last time, Mr. Smith? What? Your race tomorrow. I can't wait to see the big guy strut his stuff again. Spouting a bunch of goddamn nonsense, is what you're doing. Ace :  "Wait"? "Wait to go Greek"? What the hell's that supposed to mean? Yeah, that's what it says...  "wait  to go Greek." "Michael, DiRossi, and Cohen" on the card. The three stooges. "Wait to go Greek." ( Cell phone beeping ) You going somewhere I don't know about? Where am I going? Huh? Where am I going? I heard you. Could "wait to go" mean "way too"? Like "congratulations, your horse won"? It doesn't say "way to go." It says "wait to go Greek." Read it. Read. What is the first letter? That's a "w." And the last of the first word? "Ait." No. "T"! He means maybe like when they called the bakery, there was an icing error. Oh, ice this. Hey, Gus,  order miss... what's her face roses. Claire? Claire. You, sit down. I'm gonna give you your marching orders. No icing error, this. ( Touch tones beeping ) ( Phone ringing ) ( Ringing ) Hello? Hello? Yeah, keep breathing heavy, Brian. I'm gonna disconnect this f*cking phone line, I swear to God. N-no, don't... don't hang up, Lynn. D-don't hang up. It's me, Joey. ( Sighs ) What do you want, Joey? I-I'm just glad I caught you at home, huh? ( Car skidding in video game ) Yeah, well, the hotshot pissant got suspended, and I'm missing three days of f*cking work. So... Suspended, huh? Yeah. You know, I'm really swamped, Joey. Okay? Yeah, I-I guess you didn't get my messages from yesterday, huh? No, I guess I didn't. Yeah. Okay, listen. I just... I-I called to say hi and... and I wish that... that things had worked out between us because it... it would have been great, you know? If things had worked out with us, you know? Oh, my... are you shitfaced, Joey? It's 8:00 in the morning. No, no, I'm not shitfaced. No, honey. Listen, I just want you to... to give my best to the kid, okay? And tell him to clean up his act. Yeah, okay. I'm hanging up the phone now, Joey. ( Clicks ) ( Crying ) I looked into it like you asked, and there's no preclusion as far as you being on parole. Thank you. Not to say that a felon buying into a racetrack, the state licensing board ain't gonna have a hard look. That's for me to make my case with them. You make your case with board members pretty good, huh? I generally do all right. When you think about what you're gonna do,  how does that make you feel? Good. Good? What kind of good? Good like it's good to have some fun, enjoy life? Or good like I'm gonna rub those M*therf*ckers' nose in it who did this to me? I saw him record "1958 Miles." Live. Persian room, Plaza hotel, right? September 8th. Oh! September 9th, 1958. I didn't figure you for a jazz fan, Chester. Did you ever look a horse in the eye? Never. Never near a horse. And I have a lifetime ambition to keep it that way. Let me ask you again, Chester. How do you feel, going after that racetrack? Good. Both ways. What do you think'll be our strategy today as far as... strategy? Come from out of it like before. Get out, run fast. Turn left, run faster. No. Fastest. Why don't you go eat breakfast? Yeah. Going over to red's. Want to hear what you missed at that phone booth? Hard for you to mind your business, huh? Her son was killed in Cuernavaca walking home from school. He was 12 years old. Did you give her money to go home? Hard for you to mind your business. She'll get into Mexico, but... Don't bet she gets back out. And when she can't, you know what she's going to think? It's my fault my family can't eat. My kids can't go to school now because I was selfish with my grief. That's what your money you gave her's gonna buy. You got all the answers to keep your hands in your pockets. He's already dead. You wake up with that no matter where you wake up. ( Wings flapping ) ( Horse neighing ) Whoa! ( Horse grunts ) ( Dog barking ) ( Horse bellowing ) Whoa, whoa, whoa! Whoa! Would you stop shaking the f*cking table? It ain't me this time! Oh, my gosh. Oh, my gosh. Oh, my gosh! Earthquake! Earthquake! Earthquake! Get off the banquette. ( Cracking, rumbling ) ( Car alarms blaring ) He's fine. Your horse, he's fine. Tell your friends the shaky-shaky don't bother him. ( Line beeps ) Now I'm gonna hang up on you. ( Beeps ) Who? Did you feel that out there? Is everything okay? ( Sighs ) Listen... listen to me. Any news about your horse, I'm gonna call and tell you with. No news from me is good news, senor. Yeah. We'll see you later. ( Phone beeps ) Why? He says that the horse is fine. With my own eyes I want to see how Irish is. You believe this sh1t? You think it's okay to go now? Is this your first earthquake? Are we okay, Mr. Smith? Yep. He didn't turn a hair. But I just got favored with a lawyer letter claiming I owe a stud fee and two years' board at $145,000. Jesus. I got the whole damn thing in writing. The colonel bequesting me the stud fee for years of service. Now the no-good son-in-law's questioning the colonel's competency. That trainer, Hartstone, here, sir... he lawyers some, too. Might be somebody you'd want to. Where abouts might I find him at? Unlikely in what regard? That you would be cleaning a loaded... weapon. Well, some people come home, they watch TV, or cook, or knit... And that the quake caused your pulling the trigger. What matters is the event in its entirety. "In its entirety"? Meaning what? I'm not completely sure as yet. Mr. Rathburn, either you persuade the next doctor you see you are not a continuing danger to yourself, or he's gonna file you as a 5150, and put you onto a 72-hour hold. I sense the event as a positive, doc. I can tell you that much for a fact. Hello. My name is Joey Rathburn. Hello. My name is Joey Rathburn. "Tommy Bahama." 100% cotton. Extra large. Made in China. Machine wash cold water. "Do not use chlorinated bleach." My name is Joey Rathburn. It's about time. Lonnie and I want to have a brief conversation about scratching. Jesus Christ. Guys, Escalante says the horse is doing good. Is it absolutely possible to know how he's doing after an unsettling incident like an earthquake? Only if the horse keeps a journal. Could it have been a sign not to run? Yes. Absolutely. For our horse and for none of the other horses, if we're who's stupid enough to scratch. Vote! Vote! Run? Run. Run. All right. You vote against your own proposition? I try and keep an open mind. You see, ace? The horse looks good. There you are. Good morning. Guess he didn't hear me. How are you, champ? Look at this, Ace. "Detention." It's like the horse did something wrong. I told you, his legs is okay. I mean, he handled that shaker like a pro. Oh. Announcer :  20-minute call for the third race. Gus :  Does that mean it's this guy's turn now? If it's okay, maybe you can move over with your business and we can finish getting ready this horse. Come on. All right, come on. We got that appointment. Ace :  I got a date.  I got a date. Come on, you gonna give me a nuzzle? Give me a nuzzle. Atta boy, atta boy. Look at us, hobnobbing elbows with the rich and the famous. Yeah. Please don't let me die in this f*cking shirt. He's two-to-one, our horse. They gave him actual brass nuts. I choose to believe, Mr. Israel. You'll forgive my seeing you while also entertaining others in what might be described as a business context. Mr. Israel, messieurs DiRossi and Cohen. How do you do? Nick DiRossi, Mr. Israel. Isadore Cohen. No jokes about the catskills. ( Chuckles ) Drink, Mr. Israel? Thank you, no. I will drink... Monsieur. To purposes guessed at if not yet spoken. Man :  I got to wonder,  a man gets out of jail, three years... first thing he maybe takes a girl. Sir? Any money waiting, maybe takes a trip to some island somewhere. Outside all the time, never wears any shoes. You get out a month, buy a piece of my racetrack. 5.1%. Please. Thank you. For the money people right now, as a place to get involved, horse racing is not on the list. Everything you do make sense to the money people? Probably I don't know you well enough to say the money people take it up the ass. So let me guess,  combine the racetrack with casino gambling? Maybe that's what you're thinking. It's a possibility. Whatever idea you got, 5% ain't where you're stopping. Consider it a friendly knock on the door. I wish I had a better prognosis on my prostate. A knock on the door is all you'd get. I think maybe, Mr. Bernstein, something else is going on here, something personal. And my track is only the stage where it all plays out. That's some good thinking. To business, then. Mr. Bernstein prefers to not use e-mail or telephone. DiRossi : What's he got against showing up in person? He's... he's at the track now offering $125 million for the plant, operation, and grounds, plus 350 million dependent on legislative approval of slot machines. Which would include the agreement of the Indian gaming lobby? I would assume that is the case, sir,  before legislative approval would be granted. Fair of me to believe, Mr. Israel, that when you went to work for Mr. Bernstein, you imagined your responsibilities less as in the sphere of message delivery and more managing multimillion-dollar hedge funds and derivative investments. One doesn't have to exclude the other. You're willing to make adjustments,  be adaptable, pursuing an ultimate goal. I think everyone has to. How about adjusting to... Getting two paychecks instead of one? ( Sighs ) They're heading for the gate. Do we have enough time? Yeah. Let's do it. Ready. Marcus, we're the seven. I know we're the seven. So give me the seven, the two-three-five- six-eight $10 tri. Seven with the two-six cold for 50. $200 daily double seven-seven.  That's 500. Give me a $50 double wheel, seven all, and a cold seven-two-six tri for 100. That's 800. Uh, a "brains housing" mimic, 500, plus a pick three, us with all-all for five bucks. Do that for me, too. 500 mimicking Marcus. And Lonnie's, your... it's 300. 300... Marcus :  Can we get to the window, please? Does it occur to you people that by mimicking my play, you reduce my prospective payout? You know, I-I never thought of that. Well, just forget about it. Let's just cash. Hope he gets it right. He never even asked us to name a figure. What's important... he's in our pocket. What's important is what Bernstein's got in his pocket. The f*ckin' Indian rain dancers. Right, Mike? Heh, congratulations. You win the Amana deep freeze and a free trip to the Caribbean. The Indian gaming lobby. The Indian gaming lobby is the way he'll swing Sacramento behind casino gambling at the track. He bought the f*cking Indians. f*cking Bernstein. We gotta take the f*cking Indian gaming lobby out from under him. We're gonna put the Indian gaming lobby in our pocket. 
 
 Announcer :  The horses have now reached the starting gate. ( Whistling tune ) Man :  Come on, come on. ( Bell rings ) Announcer :  And away they go. They broke in a good line, but nobody's in a hurry to take the lead. That's Castelian Spring now taking the lead with Omaha Rainbow alongside. Here's the favorite, Mon Gateau... Go, go! With a good spot, tucking in third, while Champ E is there in the front ranks as well. Mon Gateau continues to travel well. He's good. He's good. They've reached the head of the stretch with Mon Gateau on the outside, up to take on the leaders. Is that him? Where is he? Shut up. Hey! Announcer :  Ooh, Mon Gateau appeared to duck inward. Come on! Come on! Marcus :  There he goes.  There he goes. Come on. ( Cheering ) Woman :  Go! Mon Gateau has won it convincingly. Burnfoot Pride's second... Whoo! Yeah! Whoo! The f*ck's the matter with you? There may be a flag on the play. Hey, will you clowns give it a rest till the race is official? He just ran so good, I got excited. Announcer :  Ladies and gentlemen, please hold all tickets. The stewards have posted the inquiry sign. He did nothing. He didn't do a goddamn thing. I mean, why not... why not flag him for bad breath, huh? Or maybe... maybe being owned by assholes? How about that, huh? Being owned by a... by a bunch of assholes. Jesus Christ. Eh, it was ticky-tack, Marcus. They can't take him down for that. They can and they have. Yeah, these... these three human blind f*ckin' mice. ( Coughs ) What the motherfuck? You falling asleep out there? Honest, Mr. Escalante, he was moving so fast, he forgot to swap leads and jigged in just a touch on that horse that was stopping. Go tell him your cockamamie story. See if they believe it. f*ck. Had to give it a  kinahora. What is that? It's Jewish for "premature celebration." Like giving it a mush. This horse maybe got broke-down legs, but he run with a good horse's heart. Yes, sir. Yes, sir. No, sir. Remember what hand you had your stick in? Left, sir. You give that other jock a holler? Don't think I had time to, sir. Okay, that's all. Thank you, sir. It's like talking to someone who wasn't there. How many'd the horse he bothered beat? Beat two. He was going backwards, time of the incident. Unanimous, then? Men : Yeah. Okay. Announcer :  Ladies and gentlemen, the stewards have ruled that there will be no change in the order of finish. ( Crowd cheering ) Yeah! Yeah! Come on, come on, let's go to the winner's circle. Come on. Let's go. ( Kisses ) Come on, get on the horse. Go count your lucky stars, bug. Turo, congratulations! Me and the guys are stoked. What are you doing here? Minority owner in this fine animal. Goose! Renz! We did it! Congratulations, man. Good job. You guys wanna scootch together for the shot? ( Coughing ) ( Coughing ) Jesus, take another one, will ya? Stay, one more. Marcus! Marcus! Just give him extra shots, all right? Hey. ( Guys laugh ) Jeez, I feel like a landing strip. One more. Don't they teach you baby rednecks how to steer? f*ck you, man. You saw me getting in. That's one. There's no two. Do you understand the position you're in now? I think so. Say what you think you understand. I'm still in your employ. And also in theirs. Did you set a salary figure with them? It's probably the right move. Makes him look like an amateur. Nice imitation, kid. Did you get 'em to ask about the Indians? The Indian gaming lobby. Yes, they did. They know the lobby's in your pocket. All right. You did very good. ( Sighs ) If I'm gonna feel sick all the time... I don't know if I'm gonna wanna do this. You feel sick? 'Cause you're an honest man... So far. Renzo :  This sounds strange, but he's got a pretty face. He was unbelievable. Did you see him? Oh, a couple more olives, please, doll. Hey! Gentlemen, I'd like to propose a toast to Leon. You will be on that horse as a rider wherever he goes. From us, his buddies what own him... To Leon. ( People cheering ) Man :  Great ride, kid.  Great ride. Leon! I'll drink to that. ( Groans ) Just one more thing, Leon. We'd like to give ya 200 extra. We bet a little for you. Oh, thank you, sir, but that's not necessary. It's Lonnie, Leon. Lonnie McHinery. Well, it sounds like McHinery, but it's spelled m-c-h-I-n-e-r... m-o-r-o-n. ( Pool balls clack ) Heh, he's a kidder. Thanks again for the drink. No, no. Come on, stay, talk. So how'd you get into this line of business? Good evening, one and all! Lorelei, I'll have the usual, please. Thank you. Just the usual for me. Sir. Nice ride, kid. Peter Piper picked a peck of peppers. "Pickled peppers," asshole. ( Music playing ) On his toes today, boss? Paco, give him a turn there. All right. Now, listen. You just keep him settled coming up to the gate. Now he's gonna do the rest all on his own, so... Safe home, Rosie. Thank you, Mr. Smith. Paco. That's it. Come on. Easy does it. Easy now. Easy now. Come on. Yeah. Good. That's good. That's good. ( Horse snorts ) Come on, come on. Yes, sir! Straighten him up! Here we go. Announcer :  Last one going in. And away they go! Gettin' Up Morning goes straight to the front, joined along the inside by Mack's Hero. Now Mack's Hero takes command with Gettin' Up Morning taken back to second, ahead of Eve's Revenge and Dereliction. Mack's Hero continues to cut out a decent pace. Gettin' Up Morning's right there to keep him honest. And now Dereliction moves up to challenge. Picking up the pace now with three furlongs to run, Dereliction and Gettin' Up Morning go with him. Mack's Hero is game on the lead. Sit tight, girl. Sit tight. Just stay there. Here's Dereliction putting up a fight on the outside. Gettin' Up Morning between them, refusing to yield. No, girl! Goddamn it, no! Son of a bitch! Announcer :  Take a look at this! Gettin' Up Morning has exploded away from those two! It's going to be all Gettin' Up Morning. Here's a star in the making. Gettin' Up Morning running another big one! He'll win by six lengths at the end. Oh, sh1t. Dereliction holds on for second, Eve's Revenge third. Ladies and gentlemen, the time on the board: One minute, 32.21 seconds establishes a new track record for the distance and surface. You picked the wrong day to have a long lunch in Koreatown or whatever the f*ck it is you're doing, 'cause you just missed the second coming of Man O' War. Get that race up on the site right away. That was crazy. Do we even got a picture of Walt Smith? ( Music playing ) Good job, Walter. Woman :  Congratulations, Walter. Thank you. ( Laughs ) Give me that stick. Go on, get your picture took. Photographer :  Okay, here we go. This way, please. Very nice. Thank you. Ronnie : Hey Joey. I got some straws over here. Don't need one, Ron. Thanks. Come on, give me the low down, Joey. If you must know, Ronnie, I was th-th-thinking ab... thinking about what? I was thinking about harming myself. B-but then I-I thought the better of it. J-j-Joey, is your s-s-stammer back? Leave it to you, Ronnie. How he feel? Legs are tight and cold. Good. And Irish is doing fine. Good. Yeah, I stand him with him before. They say people shouldn't go to bed angry with each other. Oh, yeah? 'Course, all we do is f*ck and run anyways, so the point's kind of moot. Moot, huh? I'm sorry we argued is my point. Don't worry about it. I'm not worried about it, I'm... apologizing. Okay, good. Look, there's room in the world for me to apologize and for you to be a jerk and an asshole. Yeah. Thanks for the space to move around. You okay? I'm good. I'm great. Stay the f*ck away from me. Yeah, good. I'm knocked up, you stupid b*st*rd. Evening, gents. Rosie? Evening, miss. Have a word with you, boss? I'm sorry, what I done out there, going to the whip. I thought I told you you wouldn't have to. I didn't think I was pulling the trigger. I... ( sighs ) You gotta teach 'em, a race at a time, what they need to know for the race that they're in. It's just that colt inside me was just going so easy, and... I-I guess anxious got the better of me. Anyways, I'm just so sorry for doing it. After you told me to just sit still. I could just kill myself. Now, now then, Rosie. I'm not saying we've ruined him. I'm not saying that at all. It just wouldn't be what should've been done. That's all I'm saying. Track record. ( Sighs ) It's gonna get crazy now. How's my horse? Walter. Thank you. Your horse winning, overcoming everything was so impressive. Very... resilient. Mm. I was hoping... That you'd have allowed me to stay. I... I... you know, I didn't want to impose. No place for you to... Rest or the like. Well, for what it's worth, I've spent millions of nights in barns. You wouldn't be imposing to ask me to stay. I would have made do. I'm very self-reliant. Well, it doesn't matter. I've hurt your feelings. No, no, no, no. No. No. Aren't you hungry? I'm a vegetarian. ( Laughs ) I... really, I do have such a big appetite, but... You know, I've never let it bother me. ( Chuckles ) Really? I have seen people profoundly changed simply by being in proximity to horses. Their size, their virtue, their complicated nature bring out patience and respect. Don't be afraid of that, Chester. Of what? Of everything that can be. ( Ace sighs ) What can be. Oh, sh1t. ( Coughs ) Gus :  Ace. You okay? Huh? What is it? What's the matter? I couldn't sleep. That kid's in position, God help him. Israel? And they think... I've got the Indians. Yeah. I'm just glad I'm on your side. What can be. My horse could become champion. My grandkid could come home. I could... hey, Gus. Gus. Gus! Y-yes, I... Ahem, I think that's right, Ace. No, don't pretend to have a conversation with me. If you're tired, for God's sake, you go to bed. Go on. Okay. Go ahead. All right, I'll go. Please. You sure you're all right? Sleep well. Good night, Ace. What is f*cking wrong with me? ( Music playing )
