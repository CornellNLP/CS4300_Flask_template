 Eddie : Previously on "The Path"... 
 I want to apologize. 
 I would ask that you stop your campaign of false propaganda. 
 Parker : The stuff that DeKaan puts in that water isn't going to show up on your average tests. 
 Can you find it? 
 Yeah, but it's not cheap. 
 Sarah : I told the people of Clarksville that I would test their water, and now I need the funds to do it. 
 She blackmailed you. I can go to jail if I have to. 
 I am not letting you go to jail. 
 Mary : I had other relationships. 
 You're my wife, and I am with you, if you're with me... only me. 
 The meds are going to help ease the panic attacks, dysphoria. 
 I spoke with a colleague who gave me information about a support group. 
 My name is Eddie, and I was in a cult. 
 But I owe my life to Steve and his work, and I will find who hurt him. 
 What if that man was Cal? 
 There's someone among us? 
 [suspenseful music] 
 ♪ ♪ The Path 2x05 Why We Source Cal : I remember... I think I was eight or nine, Steve asked me what I thought The Movement had most to fear. "Ignorance," I answered. "No," he replied. "Complacency." Our own complacency. It's so easy to become fixated on the rungs, both the one you're on now, and the one you're ascending to. Always, always inside your own head, where you find you can think of nothing but ascension. It's a... it's a kind of tunnel vision, so... Why are they doing this? Did you talk to Cal? I saw murder in his eyes. I've seen that look too many times. I checked the travel records. He was here when Steve died. So he didn't do it with his bare hands. Sarah asked me to come back. She needed someone here with Steve's interest at heart. Is what she's doing now with Steve's interest at heart? There's always more space to be filled with... with all that The Light has to give us. And that is why we source. Cal : Have a seat. How are you today, Oliver? Good, sir. No need to call me sir. Nothing to be nervous about, really. Okay. Can you go ahead and place your left hand, palm down, on the clear page in front of you? Like this? That's exactly right. Do you understand why you're here? I think so. Cal : Mm-hmm. Is it supposed to do this? We keep damage stored inside of us. It becomes chemicals. When the right questions are asked, the chemicals mix with our sweat. The pink tells us that you're holding back. You need to uncover more, so we can help you... help yourself. [exhales deeply] Can you state your name for me? My name is Eddie Lane. Um... It's my second time here. I've been out of my, uh... I left my cult, um... six months ago. And it's been, uh, it's been hard. You know, I've had panic attacks, um... paranoia. We've all been there. We call this the Anomie stage. You're refocusing from the group mind to the I. You're asking who am I. Yeah, which has been... it's been hard. 'Cause I've spent the last, God, almost 20 years knowing what this was all about, you know. I was going to sleep for what I was waking up for. You know, I knew what was going to happen when... when I died. Um, I knew how to raise my kids. [dark music] I, uh... I had my kids. And the thing is, I really thought that I was freer that I had even been. ♪ ♪ You know, freer... I thought I was freer than the rest of the world. ♪ ♪ But, you know, now I see the truth. ♪ ♪ It controlled me. Cal : Are you free? Oliver : I don't think so. Not yet. Cal : Well, what controls you? Oliver : Pornography. Yeah, that would definitely be my thing. It's all been like this. Run of the mill, s*x stuff. Oliver : Before I came here, I was watching it, like, 16 hours a day. I told you there's been nothing. If the FBI have someone among us, I haven't found them yet. [exhales deeply] Sarah, um... Lisa Jackson would have told you anything to get her tape back. Mm, you weren't there. She was telling the truth. And it could be anyone. Guilt can be very powerful. Keep looking. This is just routine. You can relax. Oh, man. So good we do this. I don't smoke anymore. I just... just in case. It's all good. This is why we source. "To uncover that which you hide from yourself." It's beautiful. Now you decide what to do. You want to put it back under the mattress, or give over. Completely. Empty yourself, so that you can be filled with The Truth. Yeah! [laughing] All right, girls, who's next? Cal : Do you find you can trust people? Abe : No. Cal : No? I'm ex-military. I worked in security for years. Life experience has beaten the trust out of me. Yeah. So you, uh, you know all the tactics then. To deceive. That's my job. It was my job. Knowing what deception looks like.

Well, I told Sarah here I'd be glad to do it. I love to stick it to the man and God, whoever I can who thinks he's above me. I can offer you 25 grand. I thought perhaps you'd like to donate the extra cost of your services to the greater good. The kind of testing you're asking for is time-consuming and expensive. The community's trying to pull together extra funds. If I get my friends and neighbors to throw in their last dimes, how can we be sure you're gonna find what's in the water? You believe there's something in your water, Mr. Small? I know there's something in our water. [tense music] ♪ ♪ [exhales deeply] ♪ ♪ 
♪ ♪ 
♪ ♪ Gaby : What did he do? Hey, what's going on? I'm his mother. We have a warrant for Hawk Lane. What for? Breaking and entering, vandalism. They'll explain the charges after booking. Mom, is this... You need a lawyer before you say anything. Okay, listen, I'm gonna be right behind you, okay? Mom, what's going on? It's gonna be okay. ♪ ♪ Everything's ruined. The fridge is completely broken. Does he know? Does Cal know the baby could be his? I don't think so. I got called in to source today. How am I not going to tell him everything? How am I not going to... You can't. You have to keep everything inside. But how? And why? Because we can use it. Cal doesn't want anyone to know something happened between us. He doesn't want Sarah to know. I love our life. I love this house. We can have more. Just need to be careful. [dark music] [door buzzes] [indistinct chatter] Hey, how's it going, sweetheart? You can take the bottom bunk. Hi, I'm Hawk. He don't talk to us. 'Cause we're white. I'm Hawk. Nice to meet you. Hawk, that's like a bird, Hawk. You got a cool name. You got big hair, that's cool hair. So wh... what'd you do to get in here? I'm just gonna read... if that's okay. When can I see my son? As soon as his attorney comes out. Hey, what the hell happened? I don't know. You don't know? Our kid's locked up. No, no, I want a real lawyer, not your cult lawyer. So that's what you think now, I'm in a cult? Sarah, this is bullshit, okay? This is our kid. Okay, I need you to stay calm. Let me explain what's going on because it isn't good. [door buzzes] [exasperated sigh] Are you okay? Yeah, I'm okay. We're gonna get you out of here. Why would Ms. DeKaan do this? I apologized, she said she would drop the charges. I brought the water in to be tested. Oh, so you put The Movement over your family. No big surprise. Stop it, Dad. I thought I did it under the radar. I have no idea how she found out. I'm glad you stood up to her. No, you don't know what you're talking about. Hawk, you don't want to ruin your life at 16. Why is he here? Because I am your father and someone has to look out for your best interest. I can look out for my own best interest. Okay, let's settle down. This is not a simple situation. These charges are extreme. Breaking and entering, vandalism, assault with a deadly weapon. What weapon? And the worst of it is, she somehow was able to pressure the DA into slapping Hawk with a domestic terrorism charge. What? It's a federal offense with huge ramifications. What a nightmare. Terrorism? You have got to be kidding me. Falls under eco-terrorism, but it's treated the same as any other kind of terrorism. The last thing The Movement needs... I don't care how this affects The Movement. I care how it affects my son. DeKaan has friends and influence, but she doesn't have The Light. [scoffs] Oh, my God. I don't want to be blackmailed. It's okay. I can do this. No, it is not okay, Hawk. So what happens now? Can he come home until the trial? He's being detained until they set bail. When's that? We don't have a date yet. They have 45 hours. [exasperated sigh] I re-listened to our sourcing session this morning, and some of your prior unburdening tapes. [lock latches] [sighs] Your baby died. I'm sorry. That must be the most brutal thing in the world. You have two other young children. Yes. What... what if we could reunite you with your family? Yes, yes, I'd... I'd like that. I think we can do that. I-I think that should be your goal, your family back together, part of our family. [exhales sharply] I have reason to believe there may be someone among us working for the FBI. [dark music] No way. Here? No, I-I don't see that. No. I checked your references in security, um... ♪ ♪ You have a tremendous amount of experience. Yeah. I-I'd like you to help us out, Sam. ♪ ♪ Yes, of course. Good. Good. [children laughing] Hi, um, Ms. DeKaan, it's me, Sarah, calling again, and, um, I am very, very sorry. I know you are angry, but I'm just asking you to please call me back. I'm... I'm begging you, please. Please just call me. I can't believe she won't talk it out. We should go to her house. Russel and I can drive over there. No, no, no, Carla said that'll just make things worse. Hey, you know, kids... Guys! Kids, please, can you just go upstairs to play? Upstairs, everyone. Russel, make them play upstairs. I'm trying. [laughs] [sighs] You okay, sweetie? Hey. You all right? Is Hawk in trouble because we've been seeing a Denier? What Denier? He sees the kids, Mom. At least he did. You know, Hawk doesn't see him anymore, but Summer does. He's her father, Mom. What happened to your brother... Gaby, go gentle. It has nothing to do with you seeing your dad. This will all be resolved very soon. And your big brother will be back in his room where he belongs, okay? Okay? Hey, come here. I'm sorry, I have to unburden. Russel never goes against the word, follows all the rules, and she's the Guardian of the Light? Have some compassion, sweetie. And keep your mouth shut. Russel, I want to go home. Now. That was good of you... the Summer part. Well, you would think it was good because you're guilty of the same thing Sarah is. Gaby, you've been accusing me of that for years. It's just not true. Just unburden. I'm not the one who needs to unburden. I know why Kodiak went to Siberia. To escape persecution. It had nothing to do with me. He wanted to get over you. He got caught dealing marijuana. I'm not having this conversation. I need to because having him here is throwing me off. I'm with you, Hank. You... I always have been. Don't let your fears send you down that road again. Gab... Don't lie. Just don't. Don't backpedal. I am with you. [dramatic music] ♪ ♪ Man : ♪ Who's that knocking at your door? ♪

 Hey. Sarah : Cal. I came as soon as I heard Hawk was in trouble. Why didn't you call me? Look, I am so scared. I've called Libby DeKaan a thousand times, and I'm really afraid I messed up. No, no, no, no, you did not. You had no way of knowing Ms. DeKaan was this kind of a monster. She's poisoning an entire community. Of course I should have known. We will deal with this. Eddie : Get in the car, Sarah. [car door closes] We're talking to Libby. Look, I've called her, all right? She won't pick up. Eddie, we will take care of this. This is a family matter, Cal. Sarah, just get in the car. We're gonna go help Hawk. Tell me what you need me to do, all right? I want to help you take care of this. I can have him taken away from you, Sarah. Legally. This happened on your watch. Any court of law would agree. No, he's wrong, Sarah. I have to. [car engine starting] Cal : Do you know everything you need to know? First thing that pops into your mind. Even if you don't understand the question. I know more... than I should know. All right, how so? I know things I shouldn't. Like I know that becoming a father is making me... feel different. Different? Well, in "The Ladder" it says that family is important, "if the individual family in our communities are working, then our larger family is working." I'm... I'm not sure I'm, uh, I'm following you. Now that I'm becoming a father, I have needs for my individual family. Things me and Mary and the baby need.

Want to know how many died on Memorial weekend this year? 63. 63 people on the South Side, brown people, youngest was 16. A young girl sitting in the car next to her boyfriend. [unintelligible chatter] We have a visitor. Is it okay if I listen? What's your book say about it? Your little Ladder book. Yeah, I did my research. What's your book got to say about what's happening in America? It was written in the '70s, so... And you think all this sh1t wasn't happening in the '70s? White man who wrote your book left it all out, didn't he? [laughing] No. Doc acknowledged that we were destroying ourselves with violence and pollution. He didn't, but the... The Light did, and then The Light gave him the message, and he wrote it down. The Light? [laughs] Everyone is equal in our Movement. Equal in your Movement, but better than everyone else in the world? Did the guy who wrote your book write it that way so you had an excuse to turn a blind eye? I'm in here because I stood up for people outside of our Movement. People whose water was being poisoned. And you'll be out of this prison in two days tops, and not because of your book there. Because that's the way the system works. You may think you're not a cog in it, but you are. [unintelligible PA announcement] [Samuel laughs] Do you have a plan, Eddie? Or are we just gonna sit here all day? We're gonna sit here until she comes out of the building. And then we're gonna talk to her. I don't know what you're gonna say, she's a tough woman. [exasperated sigh] No way, that's not... That's her. Excuse me, Ms. DeKaan. Uh, hi, my name is Eddie Lane. I'm Hawk Lane's father. Yes, I was very upfront with your wife, and she refused my generosity. So now you're gonna throw our son in jail for terrorism? What are you? We will stop everything. I will withdraw the testing. I am begging you. You'll never see us ever again. Hey, I know my wife put you in a complicated position, but I don't think you want anything else on your conscience.

Listen, I heard about your nephew getting locked up by DeKaan. [chuckles] I'm really sorry to hear that. It's truly awful. Okay, what? Nothing, it's just... Between us, of course. Of course. I just found out that Sarah lets the kids see their father. Oh, Eddie. It doesn't take a psychology degree to know that's why Hawk acted out in the first place. Yeah.
