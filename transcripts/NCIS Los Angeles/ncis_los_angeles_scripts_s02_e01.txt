 My boss wants to assign a liaison officer from LAPD. 
 Going undercover tonight. 
 For how long? 
 I don't know. 
 Cover's pretty deep. 
 This is every foster home I ever lived in. 
 They're all handwritten. 
 Each address was entered chronologically.... 
 All by the same person It's an aging hand. 
 You had a sister. 
 Her name was Amy.

 HETTY: Did you catch him this time? 
 You were twitching like a sleeping dog. 
 Ah, you know what they say about sleeping dogs. 
 (sighs) 
 I didn't catch him. 
 Lose him on the metro? 
 No. 
 (sighs) 
 Chased him into a building. 
 Downtown. 
 And no... I didn't see his face. 
 I wonder what Nate would make of that. 
 Same thing he made of it last month. 
 And the month before that. 
 "Unresolved identity issues." 
 Yours or the man you were chasing? 
 (sighs) 
 You need a place to live, Mr. Callen. 
 I'm staying at Sam's. 
 Spare rooms and office couches, flophouse floors are not conducive to a restful sleep. 
 And I need you awake. 
 Someone's gone missing. 
 Who? 
 Deeks.

 Human Traffic 
Original air date on September 21, 2010 
 KENSI: He never asked. 
 You've never offered. 
 I should offer? 
 Never offer. 
 Never? 
 Ever. 
 Kind of feel bad for not offering. You offered. 
 That's why I'm telling you not to offer. 
 But I-I've got a spare room. 
 Okay, so there's some stuff in it, a lot of stuff. 
 But I could clear a space on the floor, a small space. 
 Kensi, G does not sleep. 
 He catnaps, 20 minutes at a time. 
 That is not so bad. 
 Then he gets up, moves around, makes his tea, pulls the toaster apart, puts it back together, practices his Russian. 
 Okay, that could be irritating. 
 He doesn't sleep, so you can't. 
 Well, he never looks tired. 
 Morning. 
 Hey. 
 You look like crap. 
 Thank you. 
 Hey... 
 Do not offer. 
 Ms. Blye. Mr. Hanna. 
 Oversleep again, did you? 
 Early this morning, I got a call from the LAPD. 
 They've lost contact with Detective Deeks. 
 He's been on an extended undercover assignment since he left us. 
 How long has he been out of contact? 
 Yesterday afternoon. 
 It's kind of soon to be hitting the panic button, isn't it? 
 Mr. Beale. 
 14 hours ago, a bomb detonated in this car in South Central. 
 Two occupants, both killed. 
 Emilio Philip Ortega and his bodyguard, Luis Manuel Fellano. 
 Both with extensive records, mostly relating to acts of violence. 
 And both the target of Detective Deeks' undercover assignment. 
 His case officer phoned to see if he'd been in contact with us. 
 I offered our assistance. 
 Is there a military angle to this? 
 No. But Detective Deeks is still our liaison officer with the LAPD, which makes him about as close to one of us as it gets. 
 His case officer, Detective Jess Traynor, will brief you all. 
 Deeks should have phoned in the moment that happened. 
 Hence the panic button. 
 TRAYNOR: The late Emilio Ortega. 
 Born in San Diego, mother and father both illegal. 
 Collected a string of juvenile offenses when he was younger. 
 Worked with his father as a smuggler crossing the Mexican border. 
 After his father was killed, Emilio drifted up to L. A. 
 And joined a street gang that specialized in extortion. 
 After three years, Emilio was the man. 
 Figured he killed a couple of his friends on the way up. 
 Oh, that's surprising. 
 Six months ago, an informant gave us intel that suggested that Emilio was planning a career change. 
 Someone wanted to buy his particular skills. 
 Well, being a good stand-over guy isn't an uncommon skill in an L. A. street gang. 
 But knowing how to move freely across the Mexican-U. S. border is. 
 Emilio's father taught him well. 
 Drugs for guns? 
 Human trafficking. 
 We think young women and girls from as far away as Brazil. 
 Who approached him? 
 A Serbian by the name of Lazik. 
 Not a lot's known about him. 
 No criminal record, 'cause he's never been caught. 
 Rumored to run a human trafficking ring in Europe. 
 Going global. 
 TRAYNOR: Lazik put up the money for Emilio to buy a string of safe houses. 
 But Emilio needed someone who understood the real estate world, so we gave him one. 
 Deeks. 
 He went in as a lawyer who'd had his license revoked because of a couple of shady land deals. 
 It was easy for Marty-- 
 D-Detective Deeks-- to spin it. 
 You know he was a lawyer? 
 Yeah, I know. 
 So who killed Emilio? 
 Emilio was pissed that he'd done all the work and that Lazik was gonna make all the money, and he told Deeks he was gonna do something about it. 
 Someone must have tipped Lazik off. 
 And now he's reasserting control. 
 Where does this leave Deeks? 
 I wish I knew. 
 Cell phone? 
 Turned off. 
 GPS tracker? 
 We only tagged Deeks' car. 
 And we found it a couple blocks away from our safe house. 
 We have protocols for this kind of situation, and Deeks hasn't responded to any of them. 
 Who spoke to him last? 
 I did. 
 Regular debrief. 
 Shared intel. 
 Need to know everything. 
 And you will. 
 Think he's dead? 
 Nothing for 16 hours? 
 What do you think? 
 She's holding something back. 
 I think she likes him. 
 Doesn't want to admit it. 
 No, something else. It's like she's hiding something. 
 So let's ask her. 
 (car alarms wailing) 
 (indistinct radio chatter) 
 SCARLI: Well, Callen, you know, I don't need to say anything to you. 
 I don't need to share, I don't need your advice. 
 What I do need is for you to let me do my job. 
 Your crime scene. 
 Who's this guy? 
 With me. 
 Sam Hanna. 
 Frank Scarli. 
 How many guys did Traynor brief? 
 Three. 
 I need witness statements from all of you. 
 Don't leave anything out. 
 Sorry for your loss. 
 She your partner? 
 No. 
 Deeks was her partner. 
 They'd just started working together. 
 I didn't envy him, either. 
 She could be difficult. 
 Four months they worked on this case. 
 You know what they had at the end of four months? 
 They had nothing. 
 And nobody could figure out why. 
 Did she tell you that when she briefed you? 
 I didn't think so. 
 This case was stone-cold dead yesterday morning. 
 It wasn't going anywhere. 
 Now I got a cop dead, I got two missing, and I got a triple homicide. 
 Lazik? 
 Emilio Ortega's got a lot of guys out there that would love to whack him. 
 No thought of killing a cop or two, either. 
 But he's gonna learn something now. 
 He's gonna learn that you can't do this and not pay for it here. 
 'Cause California isn't Mexico. 
 Not yet, anyway. 
 What if Deeks is still alive? 
 What if his cover hasn't been blown? 
 Take a good look over there at Traynor. 
 And then you let me know if you think that Deeks is still alive. 
 LAPD investigation. 
 Stay out of our way. 
 He's looking for payback. 
 KENSI: Seen this before. 
 Same kind of blast pattern, same size detonation. 
 Where? 
 Crime scene photos from Emilio's car this morning. 
 Wasn't a timer; there's no way of guaranteeing she'd be in the car. 
 Yeah, not enough time to wire it to the ignition, either, which leaves... 
 Remote. 
 They were out here... 
 Waiting for her. 
 (sighs) 
 HETTY: Nate. 
 (sighs) 
 You rang? 
 I called. 
 I didn't ring, Nate. 
 No, I meant, like... 
 Okay... 
 Two unrelated questions. 
 Shoot. 
 I mean ask away. Ask away. 
 Uh, as I'm sure you're aware, Mr. Callen is staying over in Mr. Hanna's spare room. 
 Yes. 
 In your professional opinion, and knowing Mr. Callen as you do, do you think there's any benefit for him in this arrangement? 
 Well, the upside is, it puts him in a home environment with somebody he knows and trusts. 
 And the downside. 
 It puts subtle pressures and strains on their relationship. 
 I've noticed. 
 Mr. Hanna looks like crap. 
 (chuckles) 
 And in the long term, it does nothing to help Callen resolve his issues of abandonment and isolation he's suffered since he was a child. 
 He needs his own place, Hetty. 
 Don't we all? 
 Uh, second, unrelated question. 
 Do you have plans for this weekend? 
 Plans? 
 Plans. 
 Uh... 
 Are you asking me out? 
 No, that'd be weird. 
 Um... (clears throat) 
 No. No... no plans. No plans. 
 Good. 
 Thank you, Nate. 
 Thank you. 
 SAM: This guy, Lazik, is one smooth operator. 
 Links to the Russian Mafia, suspected of laundering money for the Colombians, suspected links to the heroin trade out of Afghanistan, suspected of organizing or being directly involved in at least five murders. 
 And the most anyone's been able to catch him for is speeding. 
 CALLEN: Travels a lot. 
 In and out of Europe all the time. 
 Multiple trips to Africa, the Middle East, South America. 
 Always on his own passport. 
 He's done nothing wrong. 
 Why tempt fate by using a false passport? 
 Eric? 
 Find him. 
 I want to know where he is right now. 
 I've been working on that. 
 He's using a smart passport-- electronically tagged. 
 He's on the move. 
 Paris, Dubai... 
 And we've got a final destination, but you're not going to like it. 
 Taken at an immigration gateway 24 hours ago. 
 Where? 
 Los Angeles. 
 (gun firing) 
 (sighs) 
 You shoot with your left hand? 
 Uh... 
 Not often. 
 Impressive. 
 First shot missed. 
 Well, I think you would have gotten his attention. 
 (chuckles) 
 So Lazik, the Serbian... 
 ...just landed in Los Angeles yesterday two hours before Emilio Ortega was killed. 
 And? 
 LAPD doesn't want to share. 
 Well, that's understandable, given what transpired with Detective Traynor. 
 Yeah, they told us to stay out of their way. 
 Then that's what you should do. 
 Stay out of their way and find Mr. Deeks. 
 They're not going to like it if they catch us. 
 Then don't get caught. 
 (cell phone ringing) 
 Lange. 
 Where? 
 When? 
 I will. 
 Find Lazik, Mr. Callen. 
 (door opening) 
 We were beginning to think you were dead. 
 Not yet. 
 Maybe tomorrow. 
 So... Cyrillic alphabet. 
 Russian, yeah? 
 You play? 
 In English. 
 (chuckles) 
 And badly. 
 In Russian... 
 (chuckles) 
 It's giving me a headache just thinking about it. 
 What's that word? 
 Opasnost. 
 It means "danger." 
 Great. 
 So a Russian Scrabble/Ouija board, then. 
 You're not too badly hurt? 
 I'm stinging all over here. 
 Hmm. 
 I was in Emilio's car, and, um, his remote for his security gate malfunctioned, so I jumped out to open it, and... 
 (chuckles) 
 And a few seconds either way, of course, and... 
 So Emilio's bodyguards threw me in the back of their car and got me to a doctor, which, in retrospect, I was pretty sure was a vet. 
 Ah. 
 He patched me up and... 
 Shot me with a horse tranquilizer and put me out for 15 hours. 
 When I came to, I... 
 I tried to call her, but she, uh... 
 Detective Traynor. 
 Too late. 
 So, why did you call me, instead of the LAPD? 
 'Cause LAPD would have just shut down the operation, pulled me off it. 
 There is no operation, Mr. Deeks. 
 The operation died with Detective Traynor. 
 Okay, listen. 
 Lazik's in town, all right? 
 My friendly vet told me this, and as soon as Emilio's bodyguards found out, they split. 
 This is a scary guy-- Lazik. 
 So you think he's responsible? 
 Are you kidding me? Who doesn't? 
 Well, the LAPD seems to think Emilio had a lot of enemies. 
 No. No, no. 
 It's got to be Lazik, all right? 
 Every time he called, they would argue. 
 Emilio was setting up a pipeline for Lazik to smuggle girls out of Mexico. 
 We're talking about abducted, underage and drugged... 
 Drugged girls. 
 But you have no proof. 
 Yeah, because the first shipment would have been the proof. 
 So, what exactly do you want from me, Mr. Deeks? 
 To help me finish what we started. 
 I mean, Lazik put a lot of money into this. 
 He's not going to want to turn his back on that. 
 He's looking for a replacement for Emilio. 
 That's all I want. 
 Safe house. 
 The, uh, address is on the tag. 
 Get some sleep. 
 Call me in the morning. 
 I'll see what I can do, but I have no jurisdiction over the LAPD. 
 They could simply tell me to bugger off. 
 Mm-hmm. 
 (chuckles) 
 Yeah, well, I'd like to see 'em try. 
 Think you got a triple word score there with the one with all the squiggly letters. 
 What's it mean? 
 "Be careful." 
 (laughs) 
 Okay. 
 Pretty sure you just made that up, but I, uh... but I will. 
 And, um... thank you. 
 Mr. Callen. 
 I don't take kindly to being tailed. 
 Well, I'm more of a wingman than a tail man. 
 How did you know? 
 Well, before the call, it was, "Find Deeks." 
 After the call, it was, "Find Lazik." 
 Careless of me. 
 Now, we need to find Lazik before he finds Deeks. 
 Mm-hmm. 
 (speaking Russian) 
 Goody. 
 Where'd you go? 
 Deeks is okay. 
 You actually spoke to him? 
 No, Hetty did. 
 He's fine-- he's a little shaken-- but she put him in our safe house. 
 What do you got? 
 A chink in Lazik's armor. 
 He has a serious cocaine addiction. 
 According to the LAPD file, Lazik's been to L. A. three times in the last 12 months. 
 Never stays in the same place twice, always moving around. 
 But he uses the same dealer every visit. 
 Guy called Tommy Bishop. 
 How do we find him? 
 Bright yellow '87 Camaro. 
 Up and down Hollywood Boulevard all day long. 
 Does his deals on a satellite phone. 
 Can we intercept it? 
 Eric tried. 
 It's encrypted. 
 Then we intercept him. 
 Got a plan? 
 Yeah. 
 You. 
 MAN: Yeah, this is the real deal. 
 This is pure S, man. 
 SAM: You didn't tell me Tommy Bishop looks like a pimp. 
 Kensi, you're on. 
 Know what I'm saying? 
 Have I ever done bad by you? 
 Have I? 
 (groans) 
 Man! 
 I'm sorry. 
 Look at my car. 
 Look at my car! 
 Oh, my God. 
 Lady, you had the whole street. 
 Look at this. 
 I'm so sorry. 
 I was texting. 
 It's completely my fault. 
 I looked down for a second, and then when I looked up... 
 What the...? You were texting? 
 This is really, really bad. 
 So, maybe we should exchange, uh, insurance information or something... 
 Just... forget it, all right? 
 Forget it. 
 No. Come on, man. 
 It was my fault. 
 I should have to pay for it. 
 No need, okay? 
 I got it. 
 Really? 
 Seriously? 
 Thank you. 
 It's okay. It's okay, all right? Don't worry about it. 
 Thank you. 
 
 
 
 Can't bug the phone, bug the man. 
 Eric, bug is planted. 
 Okay, Sam. Activating the bug. 
 (siren blares) 
 Got a problem, Eric. 
 Stand by. 
 (siren chirps, tires screech) 
 Stay put! 
 BISHOP: What's going on here, man? 
 I'm telling you, you got the wrong dude-- it wasn't me! 
 LAPD. 
 Hey. 
 Stay right where you are. 
 Thank you. 
 SAM: Whoa, whoa, whoa. 
 Detective Scarli. 
 I told you to stay out of this, didn't I? 
 This guy's ours. 
 The hell he is yours. 
 This is an LAPD bust. 
 I told you people I would settle this. 
 Every address, every name in Traynor's file. 
 That means you need to stay the hell out of our way. 
 You understand what I'm saying, Agent Hanna? 
 Yeah. We got it. 
 Great. 
 BISHOP: Yo, man, why you messing with me, man? 
 (sighs) 
 There goes our plan. 
 I guess we'll just have to go with plan B. 
 Tommy Bishop's phone. 
 Do we know if Lazik called him? 
 That's what you're gonna find out for us, Eric. 
 Crack the encryption, see who he's called. 
 Got it. And... 
 Have we got something for you. 
 Emilio Ortega's cell phone log. 
 Eric ran a check on all of the numbers made and received, came up with this number. 
 27 calls in the last six months, most of them incoming. 
 Call durations varied. 
 Some were a few seconds; most five, ten minutes in length. 
 Do we have a name? 
 It's kind of hard to believe. 
 Try us, Nate. 
 Detective Jess Traynor. 
 Like I said, kind of hard to believe. 
 Is that landline or cell phone? 
 Cell phone. 
 Now, we managed-- well, Eric managed-- to access the voice mail. 
 Only one message. 
 TRAYNOR (on voice mail): Emilio, it's Traynor. 
 We need to meet-- two hours' time, same place. 
 Call me back if you can't make it. 
 Face time as well as phone time. 
 And more than once. 
 When was that message left? 
 One hour before Emilio was killed. 
 Did he call her back? 
 No. 
 That means he was going to make the meet, then. 
 Deeks' LAPD handler was on Emilio's payroll. 
 SAM: Scarli said the operation was going nowhere; they had nothing. 
 Might explain why. 
 But Traynor sabotaging her own operation? I mean... 
 Nate? 
 It's possible. 
 She certainly wouldn't be the first. 
 Motive would probably be money. 
 Lazik finds out Emilio's got a cop on the payroll, doesn't like it... 
 Tags both of them. 
 Where does this leave Deeks? 
 Next on Lazik's hit list. 
 If he knew about Traynor, you got to believe he knew about Deeks. 
 ERIC: Hey, guys. I'm in. 
 Bishop encrypted everyone's name and number, but he really should've paid for the security updates. 
 His encryption program's so last week. 
 Lazik called Bishop 20 minutes after he landed. 
 Long flight-- 
 Lazik needed to score. 
 All right, his phone is on, and we are searching. 
 Got him. 
 Well, his cell phone, at least. 
 Let's hope Lazik didn't lend it to a friend. 
 Only one way to find out. 
 (line ringing) 
 Shh... 
 MAN: Hello? 
 Hello? 
 ERIC: Pulling up Lazik's passport photo. 
 And... he did not lend his cell phone to a friend. 
 All right, what now? 
 Well, Deeks is a cop, so technically, we should pass the intel on to Detective Scarli at LAPD? 
 But Deeks is  our  cop, so... 
 (clears throat) 
 Address, Eric. 
 It's an industrial reserve. 
 The only building is a decommissioned power plant. 
 It's off the 101. 
 Check for security cameras. 
 Have I ever let you down? 
 Don't answer that. 
 So, the plant is still owned by the state, even though they hauled away the generators years ago. 
 With a little luck, they've maintained the security cameras. 
 Decommissioned for years, but the good old cameras are still standing watch. 
 (chuckles) 
 Our taxes at work. 
 Got to love that bureaucracy. 
 You mean the bureaucracy we work for? 
 Like I said, love that bureaucracy. 
 SAM: There's only one way in. 
 There's only one way out. 
 They'll see us coming. 
 And hear us. 
 (phone speed-dialing) 
 ERIC: Yo. 
 Any luck, Eric? 
 Two cameras, both exterior. 
 Three cars in the parking lot. 
 No sign of anyone outside the building. 
 What do you got on the cars? 
 I'm still working on that. 
 Limited zoom on those cameras, so I had to do some serious enhancement. 
 Two of the cars are rentals. 
 Both hired by our elusive Serbian friend, Lazik. 
 And I am running the registration on the third car now. 
 I'm just pulling up the driver's license. 
 Oh, crap. 
 Eric? 
 Car's registered to Dale John Sully. 
 Callen, that's Deeks's alias. 
 Thanks, Eric. 
 (phone beeps) 
 Deeks is in there. 
 SAM: If Lazik knows he's a cop... 
 We need a plan. 
 Fast. 
 You got any duct tape? 
 Don't move. 
 (speaking Serbian) 
 Turn around. 
 Hm? 
 All right, he's clean. 
 Sure. 
 I love you, too. 
 Ciao. 
 (phone beeps) 
 Sorry. 
 My wife. 
 What? 
 You are surprised I have wife? 
 Everybody's got to have somebody, right? 
 Now that I'm cutting my trip short, she want to meet me in Paris. 
 I'm good husband. 
 You are very brave for coming to see me. 
 Listen, I understand that Emilio screwed up, but I didn't have anything to do with that. 
 Emilio lied to me! 
 Okay. 
 He had contact in LAPD, but he did not tell me that. 
 So he have to pay price for poor judgment. 
 And now because of that, four months' work and lots of money wasted. 
 That's why I'm here. 
 It's not wasted if you let me take over. 
 You hear? 
 Business proposition. 
 Listen, I helped set up the safe houses. 
 I know the people to pay off at the border. 
 So? Go on. 
 All I'm asking for here is one shipment, all right? 
 One shipment. I screw it up, you close it down, nothing lost. 
 But if I make this happen, you and I, we're in business. 
 And all that money is not wasted. 
 You are very persuasive. 
 Thank you. 
 But I am afraid it's not going to work. 
 It can work-- you just got to give me a chance. 
 Shame. 
 Working with you would have been so much more interesting than Emilio. 
 It still can be. 
 No, it cannot be... 
 Mr. Deeks. 
 Pardonnez-moi... 
 Detective Deeks, LAPD. 
 Hmm? 
 (cocking hammers) 
 It's a shame. 
 My wife would really like you. 
 Kensi, you on line? 
 On line and in position. 
 Sam? 
 I'm set. You're good to go. 
 (grunting) 
 (Deeks groans, coughs) 
 (panting) 
 You don't have to go through this. 
 Okay, I'm just gonna be on my way, then. 
 (grunts, groans in pain) 
 You just need to tell me how far this goes. 
 Is it Interpol? 
 Does it reach me in Europe? Serbia? 
 It goes all the way to your bedroom, Popov. 
 (grunting) 
 You think I don't know about you? 
 I find out about you long time ago. 
 Emilio. 
 He never told me how he knew, but I find out he's making payoff to someone in your office with my money. 
 Mine! 
 Ah... 
 That's too bad. 
 (engine revs outside) 
 Yeah. 
 (panting) 
 I wanted to see how far this goes. 
 Yeah. 
 So I had him followed. 
 (phone beeps) 
 You know her? 
 I've never seen her before. 
 No? 
 No. 
 She's foxy, though, right? 
 Taken outside Detective Traynor's apartment. 
 You liked her, no? 
 You like dirty cop? 
 She dirty in bed, too? 
 (grunting) 
 Maybe Emilio didn't have to pay her much, after all. 
 (loud grunt) 
 You can't come here. 
 Relax, pal, all right? 
 All right, I got a special delivery from Tommy Bishop for his good friend, Mr. Lazik. 
 Let's go. 
 Who are you? 
 What do you want? 
 I'm guessing you're Mr. Lazik. 
 "Lah-zitch." 
 CALLEN: Tommy has a buying opportunity. 
 Thought you might be interested in a business proposition. 
 LAZIK: No. 
 (gunshot) 
 (groans) 
 Federal agents. No one move! 
 (shouting) 
 (grunting) 
 Deeks? 
 I'm good. 
 (gunfire continues) 
 (Lazik shouting in Serbian) 
 (sighs) 
 (clattering) 
 (groaning) 
 (sighs) 
 (sighs) 
 Couple more minutes, I think I could have taken 'em all. 
 Hey, Deeks. 
 It's good to see you. 
 Good to see you, too, Sam. 
 Callen. Sam. 
 Clear, Kensi. 
 Told you I'd be back. 
 Oh, shut up. 
 Lazik found out that Emilio was paying off a dirty cop. 
 Traynor. We know. 
 Deeks. 
 Black, two sugars, right? 
 I'm glad you made it, kid. 
 Yeah, well, I almost didn't. 
 So what do I do? 
 About what? 
 About Traynor. 
 I mean, what do I tell Internal Affairs? 
 The truth can't hurt, Deeks. 
 She's dead. 
 Right. 
 I trusted her. 
 We all trusted her. 
 (sighs) 
 You know, she told me this story one time. 
 Showed me this photo. 
 That's her on the left. 
 The other girl's her cousin. 
 That's Christina. 
 And they're walking home one night, and this van pulls up, and these two guys jump out, and they try to abduct them. 
 Traynor, she gets away, but her cousin, she's, uh, not so lucky. 
 They found her body down in Mexico 18 months later. 
 Human traffickers, Frank. 
 So I keep asking myself... 
 You know, I said, with a history like that, how she could be in business with a scumbag like Emilio Ortega? 
 And that's when I realized it. 
 She wasn't. 
 Frank... 
 She was just trying to figure out who was. 
 So while I'm busy out there trying to catch Lazik, she's trying to win Emilio's trust, so that he's gonna tell her who it is that he was really paying off. 
 That would be you. 
 (gun hammer cocks) 
 If Lazik hadn't killed them, I would have. 
 I'm sorry, Deeks. 
 No, you're not. 
 SAM: Lower your weapon. 
 Did you get all that? 
 Every word of it. 
 (handcuffs clicking) 
 So, tell me, Deeks... 
 How was she in bed, huh? 
 DEEKS: What did you say? 
 Ask me again. 
 Ask me again. 
 CALLEN: Deeks, look, he's not worth it. 
 Ask me again! 
 (panting) 
 Ask it again! 
 Deeks, put it down! 
 Deeks. 
 (cartridge pinging) 
 (grunting) 
 (groaning) 
 You saw that! 
 You all saw that! 
 I didn't see a thing. 
 You see anything, Sam? 
 Not a thing. 
 (sighs) 
 Nate? 
 You called? 
 Pack a bag and your passport. 
 I'm sorry? 
 You're needed. 
 Needed where? 
 You'll find out when you get there. 
 There's a C-117 leaving in 90 minutes. 
 Transport's outside. 
 But I, uh... 
 You did say you had no plans. 
 (sighs) 
 Go. 
 Going. 
 (camera shutter clicks) 
 Hey! 
 (beeps) 
 (tires squealing) 
 (computer chirping) 
 HETTY: Did you catch him this time? 
 Maybe I'll never catch him. 
 Maybe you don't want to. 
 What's this? 
 It's a contract. 
 You're buying a house. 
 I negotiated a very good price on your behalf. 
 No loan required. 
 You really do live very frugally, Mr. Callen. 
 I had a friend look over the contract. 
 It cost me a bottle of Grange. 
 Consider it my housewarming gift. 
 All you have to do is sign it. 
 Hetty... 
 It's a deceased estate. 
 Vacant possession. 
 You can move in tomorrow. 
 Hetty... I don't need a house. 
 I think you'll like the neighborhood, Mr. Callen. 
 (writing) 
 The realtor has the key. 
 I've already got one.
