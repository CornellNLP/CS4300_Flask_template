 Him on the ball, from Dunbar. 
 He junior college now, but he going to bigger places if he can make them grades. 
 He our edge, right there. 
 Where he going? I don't know. 
 Uh, Terps, Hoyas, Missouri, Kansas, they all want this cat. 
 So we in the mix too now. You know what I'm talking about? 
 Proposition Joe ain't got nobody balling like this. 
 He better not have one m*therf*cker like this. 
 I'm tired of losing to these Eastside bitches. 
 It's been three years running now, man. f*cking with my morale, for real. 
 What happened to the faggot? 
 Omar? 
 That nigger in the wind, man. What you mean he in the wind, man? 
 This city ain't that big. 
 You know what that nigger do when he holed up somewhere? 
 He peel off one or two packages, roll around the neighborhood giving away free vials and sh1t. 
 On some real Robin Hood type sh1t. If we try and get at him, we gonna have two dozen niggers saying that we on our way. 
 If you want us to hunt that nigger, we gonna hunt. 
 But the smart play, I think, we call a truce, put this thing on hold for a hot second, let the faggot get comfortable, and when he do, he'll pop up his head - boom, we got him. 
 What M*therf*ckers gonna be saying while we waiting? Hmm? 
 What people gonna say when they see this cocksucking faggot out in the sunshine? 
 Like it ain't no thing to take my sh1t. 
 Kid's everything I said he was, huh? Yeah, he's straight. 
 Don't know what we're gonna do without him. 
 How come you ain't signed? Lot of schools looking at me. 
 I'm listening. Ten large, though, that ain't bad. 
 It ain't. Well, ten for the kid, plus five. 
 Uh, donation for the program. 
 Done. 
 Good. Give me 30 from the line and get out of here. 
 Yo, man, good job, baby. All right. 
 And I assume there's another five right here, for making this happen? 
 Ain't sh1t for free, right? 
 If you walk through the garden You'd better watch your back But I beg your pardon Walk the straight and narrow track If you walk with Jesus He'll save your soul You gotta keep the devil Down in the hole All the angels sing About Jesus' mighty sword And they shield you with their wings Keep you close to the Lord Don't pay heed to temptation For his hands are so cold You gotta keep the devil Way down in the hole 
 Way down in the hole Way down in the hole Way down in the hole Way down in the hole 
 So, what you do for money? Can't live without it, right? 
 You still f*cked up behind that stick-up, man? 
 sh1t ain't on you. It ain't on me neither. 
 m*therf*cker who robbed the stash shot Sterling. 
 He gonna get got no matter what you or me do. 
 I just don't wanna play. I don't wanna play no more. All right? 
 I was thinking about going to school, over at Edmondson, ask if they'll let me back in. 
 What grade? Ninth. 
 Ninth? sh1t, you how old? 16. 
 Damn, man, you supposed to be a junior by now. 
 I heard Stinkum got killed. 
 Yeah. 
 Damn. 
 Yo, I said I don't wanna play. I heard you. 
 And you ain't got to do nothing. 
 I heard you. Take it. 
 Hurry up, nigger. People looking. 
 Look here, man, you a smart little m*therf*cker. 
 You start back up at Edmondson, you likely to finish up at Harvard or some sh1t like that. Believe, B. 
 And you - you got a good heart in there too. 
 Not like the rest of these niggers. 
 Yeah? 'Ronnie Mo on Tower Phone 2.' 
 Right. 
 'Yo, you coming to get this sh1t?' 
 'Keep cool. We making rounds.' 
 'You know I ain't moving like I used to.' 'Couple of hours, we be at you.' 
 'All right.' 
 Wee-Bey picking up at the towers? 
 In a couple hours, give or take. Time enough for us to make a play. 
 What's up with Wallace? Nothing. 
 Nothing? Nothing. 
 It's all good, just leave him be. 
 Damn. 
 f*ck. 
 I'm tired of not having a phone up in this joint. 
 I'll be right back. Yeah. 
 Have a nice hike. Yeah. 
 You make order? Who this? 
 You make order? Good yakame. 
 'What?' Or no delivery. 
 You make order, you come get. Good yakame, good noodle. 
 Extra ketchup. 
 What the f*ck was that? 
 That was my Korean counterman. 
 Sounded Chinese. 
 Like you can f*cking tell the difference. 
 It's a brave new world for you, boys. 
 12-14. '12-14.' 
 Request a lateral with 12-08. 'Go ahead, 14.' 
 08, can you go to Channel 3? 12-08, I got that. 
 'Where you at?' McCullough above Preston. 
 On a good pay phone that the Pit boys are now using. 
 'I'm up on the church. Hang close, boys. 
 'Might have a nice jack-up for you two.' 
 I can't believe you boys still in business. 
 Testers coming in five. What's the new package, man? 
 Yellow tops. This sh1t is the bomb. 
 sh1t is the bomb. Check it. 
 A man who wants to get high more than clean. 
 He was doing good, too. That sh1t was bullshit. 
 Them meetings were just fronts. The man sounded strong. 
 Whatever. 
 It's about that time. 
 sh1t. What happened? 
 That's the boy who beat me down, man. 
 Hey, yo. The sh1ts right here is yellow tops and they right, so remember where you caught this blast and tell your fiend-ass friends. 
 Line the f*ck up. 
 Back up. 
 Get in line, what the f*ck? Line the f*ck up. 
 Get the f*ck out of here. f*ck y'all. 
 There you go! 
 Hurry up. Over here. 
 Get one, girl, over here. I got one, I got one. 
 You get one? I got one. 
 Yo, hold up. Hey. Hey. You catch one? 
 You know, I got three if you need. 
 You was at the meeting over at Samuel Morse. 
 Mr. One-Day Man. It wasn't even that. Stood up, though. 
 Why you at the tester line if you ain't chasing? 
 Trying to get my nephew off the corner. 
 His mama sent him up to Cumberland. Try to keep him clean at my grandma's. 
 He ain't anywhere near his bottom. Got to see that bottom coming up at him. 
 Hard too, cos he's young, 24. 
 Most people don't get tired till they're 35, 40. 
 How old are you? Young at heart. 
 Waylon, man. 
 Bubs. 
 Give them a long rope. The farther away from the projects, the less risk to the wire. 
 Hell with the wire. Excuse me? 
 'Gotcha, McNulty, you're too easy.' 
 You can come at this a few ways. 
 First thing is we need the names of all front companies, limited partnerships, LLCs, and all that mess. 
 LLCs? Limited liability corporations. 
 Start with the nightclub Barksdale owns. 
 Look up Orlando's, by address, you match it, and you see it's owned by who? 
 It's on Baltimore Street, right? 
 Got it. D & B enterprises. 
 Hand it over to Prez who's gonna get off his ass and walk over to the state office buildings on Preston Street. 
 Preston Street? Corporate charter office. 
 Corporate who? 
 'They have the paperwork on every corporation and LLC 
 'licensed to do business in the state. 
 'Look up D & B Enterprises on the computer. You're going to get a little reel of microfilm. 
 'Pull the corporate charter papers that way. Write down every name you see. 
 'Corporate officers, shareholders or, more importantly, 'the resident agent on the filing who is usually a lawyer. 
 'While they use front names as corporate officers, 'they usually use the same lawyer to do the charter filing. 
 'Find that agent's name, run it through the computer, 'find out what other corporations he's done the filing for, 'and that way we find other front companies.' 
 While he's doing that, what do I do? 
 Keep your head in this assessment book. 
 Look up any properties that you can connect to Barksdale. 
 How do you know it connects to Barksdale? 
 'You work off what Prez gets you from the corporate charter documents. 
 'Whatever companies he links to Barksdale or people connected to him, 'look for those companies in the city land records.' 
 Huh? For example, McNulty said that he heard that Barksdale owned an apartment building up on Druid Park Lake. 
 'Look up all the blocks on Reservoir Hill. 
 'See if there's anything owned by D & B Enterprises 
 'or any other company that Prez finds through corporate charter or anything similar. 
 'If you find something that fits, you write down the folio number, 'so you can look it up later at the courthouse. 
 'You don't find anything, 'take the names of all the corporate listings for the multi-units near the lake. 
 'You call that list over to Prez, who pulls the charter papers, 'and he'll look for connections.' 
 This is like a scavenger hunt. But what if Barksdale is careful? 
 What if we can't find his name on anything? 
 In this country, somebody's name has got to be on a piece of paper. 
 A cousin, a girlfriend, a grandmother, a lieutenant he can trust. 
 Somebody's name is on a piece of paper. And here's the rub. 
 You follow drugs, you get drug addicts and drug dealers. 
 But you start to follow the money and you don't know where the f*ck it's gonna take you. 
 While we're running around on this, what are you gonna do? 
 You need something? Yeah. 
 Let me get the campaign financial reports for the western districts and, actually, any citywide race. 
 Quarterly reports or individual donor lists? 
 Both, please. It'll be a couple of hundred pages. 
 Really? I'll take all of it. 
 What the f*ck, man? 
 With your right hand, reach for the window and open the door. 
 Hurry up, man. Step out of the car. 
 Drop the cane, toss the cane. Come around to the back. 
 Turn around. 
 Sir, is there anything in the vehicle we should know about? 
 Nope. 
 No guns, drugs? 
 Me ain't got sh1t. 
 This money right here, I didn't just pull this out of your truck? 
 What money? 
 We'll be counting this limp-dick cash all day. Where you guys going with this? 
 Like the man said, it ain't ours. 
 It ain't yours? So, you don't mind if we just take it off your hands? 
 Do what you feel. You pretending to take money. 
 I didn't even know it was there. I know how that sh1t is. 
 The other day, I took up the sofa cushions off my couch and found $1.40 I didn't even know was there. 
 You all ain't got no charge, right? 
 No, fucker, we do not have a charge. We just got your money. 
 You want it back, you can explain it to the state's attorney where you got it. 
 Y'all enjoy your day now, you hear? 
 As I wake up in the morning and get out of my bed I'm thinkin' 'bout the brothers... Give me three. 
 The brothers I deal with, locked up 
 As I wake up in the morning and get out of my bed I'm thinkin' 'bout the people I grew up with, long dead The brothers I grew up with, locked up I'm freestylin' off the top of my head You know it's swell, Patti LaBelle I like her but Regina Belle is better... 
 m*therf*cker! 
 Yo, m*therf*cker, trying to steal our sh1t. 
 m*therf*cker! 
 Fished your wish, Bubs? 
 Oh, yeah. 
 And you should've seen the one that got away. 
 You know, I nearly got killed behind this caper. 
 It's all in the game, Bubs. 
 Yeah? 
 Yo, Bub... 
 This ain't sh1t. 
 I'm not high, neither. 
 It's f*cking Arm & Hammer. We just been firing baking soda. 
 f*ck. It's all right. I'll just come up with another plan. 
 I did it once, right? Shh. 
 f*ck me. 
 Carv, you go to a restaurant, and say the waitress gives you good, decent service. 
 How much do you tip? How much do I tip? 
 For good service. I don't know, 15%. 
 Some people tip 20. Some people got money. 
 How much you think Wee-Bey would tip? 
 You'd be a clever m*therf*cker if there wasn't a wiretap running. 
 What do you mean? 
 Say we turn in 20, and this afternoon the bosses are listening to the wiretap and they hear we took 30 out of that car. 
 Didn't think of that, did you? 
 We're finding stuff on the west side of downtown that might be his over by that Howard Street corridor. 
 What kind of property? Low-rent commercials. A lot of vacants. 
 What does Avon Barksdale want with a string of empty storefronts? 
 This feels premature. What does? 
 Chasing up assets. We're not close to putting a charge to the man. 
 That should be the priority. We put a charge to him, the deputy shuts us down, tells us to go home. 
 You want the money side of this case, it's now or never. 
 Whoop-whoop! 
 I'm working here. Whoop-whoop! 
 Maybe 20 or 30. Dollars for donuts. 
 You should've seen the looks on their faces. 
 What did Wee-Bey say? "What money?" 
 The only hassle is we need to count this sh1t. 
 Do the ECU Submissions. It's all limp-dick, dime-vial money. 
 Dirty bills right off the corner. 
 You all got the Pit boys on a fresh payphone? 
 On McCullough. You take pictures? 
 We're gonna need an additional affidavit to get up on that phone. 
 Another 30 days, McNulty? 
 What the f*ck did I do? 
 One day he fights, next he's ready to roll over. 
 Does he want this f*cking case or not? Give him some slack. 
 He's wrestling with the angels on this one. 
 Where's my lucky pen? 
 'You ready, bitch?' 'I'm ready. 
 'I wanna get on my knees and suck you like a big lollipop.' 
 'Suck it.' 'I know that's your favorite.' 
 'Let me lick that. You like that?' 
 'I want you to butt-fuck me...' 
 We're supposed to turn off the tap when it's non-pertinent. 
 f*ck, no, this is too good. 
 'f*ck me.' 'Ooh, Daddy, yeah. Oh! Oh!' 
 There's no way I'm transcribing this stuff. 
 'Touch yourself. 
 'Oh, yeah. My pussy is so wet right now.' Phone s*x? 
 sh1t was hilarious. 
 You're supposed to shut down if it's non-pertinent. 
 'You're gonna look like a glazed donut.' 'Is that right?' 
 'I'm gonna get there and f*ck you in all three holes.' 
 'You're gonna come past?' 'Tomorrow, yeah. 
 'But I need to go past Argyle Street tonight, check in with Wallace. 
 'He off the hook since we helped the tower crew get that stick-up boy. 
 'Wallace is bugging. Don't hardly even come out of that room no more.' 
 'Why he be like that?' 'I think he might be getting high.' 
 'Boy is scaring me.' 'You holler at me later.' 
 'That'll work.' 
 Pertinent now, right? 
 It is if you can explain why we're on the line after 10 minutes jerking off. 
 You gotta justify that. 
 Maybe three holes was the code for three stash houses. 
 Omar! 
 Yo! 
 Omar coming, Omar coming! 
 Did you hear me? Omar coming. Let's get out of here. 
 Close that sh1t down I said, Omar coming through. 
 Somebody in trouble now. Let's go. 
 Eyy-yo. 
 Eyy-yo. 
 Eyy-yo. 
 Y'all need to open this door, man, before I huff and puff. 
 By the hairs of your chinny-chin-chin. 
 You best roll out. We up in here with a MAC-10. 
 I thinks not, Terrell, I thinks not. 
 Y'all might need to think this through and stop wasting my time. 
 Because Omar can come back tomorrow. 
 And the next day. 
 And the next day. 
 And I will put a bullet in all y'all behind, what happen right now, you heard? 
 Fair enough. 
 Here you go, keep it. 
 How do you wanna play it? 
 Hard and tight, like she's got no choice. 
 Shardene Ennis. Miss, we need to talk. 
 About what? It's a downtown talk. 
 This way. Come on. Come on. 
 Two at a time! Two at a time! 
 Give me a two and two. 
 Yo, what's up? What you got? 
 Family affair, two-for-one, you up? 
 Nah, not me. All right. 
 How you figure all these little pebbles get up on top of the roof? 
 Where's everybody at? 
 Maybe the whole thing is over and no one bothered to tell us. 
 Maybe we won. 
 Something ain't right. 
 Come on, let's take a ride. 
 I like these. 
 Yeah? 
 The toy furniture is great. Doll house miniatures. 
 It's a hobby. 
 My sister had a doll house when we were young, but nothing as nice as these. Can I? 
 Sure, babe. 
 That's a walnut marble-top vanity. 
 Renaissance revival, late 19th century. 
 Do you have a house for them? 
 No, I just make them and sell them. 
 That seems kind of sad. 
 You should have a house for them. 
 We can use the Lieutenant's office. 
 No. I ain't asked for nothing. 
 Oh. What's up, Tasha? You got too pretty, girl. 
 Go inside, Tash. 
 I'm thinking, um... 
 Thinking about getting clean...again. 
 I was thinking I ain't got no other place to go, maybe... 
 That's wrong, right? 
 That ain't right, right? Sorry. 
 I'm sorry. 
 Wait. 
 Back door only. 
 There's an old sofa in the basement. I'll throw you down some blankets. 
 You try to come up those stairs, and I'm gonna call the police. I swear I will. 
 West f*cking Baltimore is on vacation. 
 No crews slinging in the low-rises, the towers. 
 What the f*ck? 
 Who's playing who? West against East. 
 Baltimore? The projects, man. 
 The bragging rights to the projects. 
 The projects got a ball team? 
 How long you been working at Orlando's? 
 Four or five months. You like it? 
 Pays the rent. You must see a lot there, I imagine. 
 What do you mean? There's a lot of game being played. 
 I just work for tips. 
 For tips? Tips, drinks. 
 I'm just a b-girl. I don't mess with nothing beyond that. 
 Some of the girls in there, they're into drugs. 
 Some of them turn tricks in the rooms upstairs but I mostly just stay at the bar. 
 Hmm. 
 It's rare when we ask somebody to come downtown with us, with no charge, we don't tell them what we're gonna talk about, and they come without complaining. 
 That hardly ever happens. Rarely, if ever. 
 I figure you got your reasons. The crew that runs Orlando's. 
 They've dropped about a dozen bodies over the last year. 
 They're running the drugs in every housing project west of the Martin Luther King. 
 I don't know anything about that. I just work for tips. 
 Now you do know, because we're telling you. 
 You know a girl named Keisha Michaels? 
 She dances with me. How's she doing? 
 All right, I guess. 
 Will you excuse us a moment? 
 So, what do you think? I think she's a sweetheart. 
 If we push her hard, she'll tumble. You want to show her the pictures? 
 I want to do better than that. 
 Come on, man, play defense. 
 Let's go! D-up, B. 
 Who is he? That's Marcus Rivera, man. 
 He out of Lake Clifton. That nigger played in Italy and sh1t. 
 Yo, Slim. What's up, man? You got to go all the way to Europe to get you a ringer? 
 He home now. But I see you pulling boys out the junior colleges. 
 He from Eastside, went to Dunbar. 
 Playboy, how come you wearing that suit? 
 It's 85 f*cking degrees and you trying to be like Pat Riley. 
 Look the part, be the part, m*therf*cker. 
 You got a fake f*cking clipboard. You can't even read a playbook. 
 Be for real. Bunch of bitches. 
 Yeah! 
 Let's go. That was nice. 
 That boy was talking to God, right? 
 Oh! 
 Ain't y'all on the clock? 
 Ain't you? We on a break. 
 Then we on a break too. What's up with this game? 
 Just something we do every year. Eastside versus Westside niggers. 
 Loser gotta throw a big-ass party at Druid Hill next week. 
 Who's favored? Eastside won the last two years. 
 My boys. 
 Found nude Monday morning, in a dumpster off Reisterstown Road. 
 Toxicology is positive for heroin and cocaine. 
 In a dumpster? Rolled up in a rug. 
 She overdosed and whoever was with her just rolled her up and threw her away. 
 That's how they do. 
 Positive for semen in vaginal, a**l and oral cavities. 
 
 
 
 Three different blood types, all secretors. They f*cked her and threw her away. 
 The only reason we knew who she was or what she was about or what she might mean to someone like you is because we've been keeping an eye on the people who run Orlando's. 
 We got ways of knowing what they're saying, thinking. 
 You know what they said about this one? Bitch didn't know how good the snort was. 
 That it was her own fault. That's how they do. 
 They use people, and when they throw them away, they find a way to say it ain't on them. 
 Lying m*therf*cker. He said they took her to a hospital. 
 Now get back on D. Check out Avon. He's freaking. 
 sh1t, man, we got to win this one. 
 Yo, I think Avon's here. 
 Where? Like I know what he looks like. 
 He's a black guy rooting for Westside. 
 We might have a visual on Avon. Street ball game up at Cloverdale. 
 Where's Greggs and Freamon? Pressing the stripper they picked up. 
 You and Carver stay on the radio. 
 We should follow him. Why? 
 He ain't gonna touch drugs or money anywhere you can see him, Lieutenant. 
 In Narcotics we follow guys. We do it well, we make cases on it. 
 Mount up. 
 We been on this guy three months. Don't you even wanna get a look at him? 
 I wouldn't know Avon Barksdale if I fell over him in the street. 
 I don't need to. We get him by voice alone or we don't get him. 
 Yeah, baby! 
 Half-time. 
 You got yourself a fine ringer. 
 Yeah, baby, it's not your year. 
 It look that way, but you never know. I know, man, we up 12. 
 You is, but I got a proposition for you. 
 Okay. Double down? 
 Let's give this wager a clean six figures. 
 You serious? I don't give a f*ck. It's your money. You can waste it if you want. 
 Anyone got him? '64-Charlie to central K.' 
 12-10. 
 '12-10.' 
 12-10. 
 You have him? 
 Lieutenant, I don't even know what I'm looking for. 
 Yeah, that's what I'm talkin' about. 
 Got him marked. On the sideline, red shirt, white visor. I think he's coaching. 
 Yo, who this f*cking midget, yo? 
 Get that midget out of here, B. 
 Hey. 
 'Why you holler at me?' 'We getting down to it.' 
 'I get to you when I get to you.' That's it, we're on the stash. 
 We are? Mmm-hmm. 
 How can you put that down when Sydnor wasn't on the roof? 
 Yes, he was. 
 No, he's not, he's with Daniels. 
 No, he isn't. 
 Oooh! 
 Get the f*ck out of here. Ref, what the f*ck? 
 What the f*ck? 
 Ref! Ref, what the f*ck? 
 The boy was fouled. Clear, straight up! 
 How you gonna not call that? 
 I can put time back on the clock and replay it. 
 You talking about a do-over? A f*cking do-over? 
 That's not how the game is played! You can't do that! 
 Nigger talking about doing it again. 
 I don't want any trouble. Ain't gonna be no trouble over no ball. 
 Man, you supposed to be the ref. 
 Why don't you stand up for your f*cking self? You pussy. 
 You can't let any old motherfucking nigger get in your face, understand? 
 Walk away. Walk away! 
 Turn around and walk the f*ck away. 
 Ignorant m*therf*cker. 
 We cool? We cool, baby. 
 Tell your people to come to the park Saturday at noon. 
 You come on the Westside again, without a ball, I'm gonna light your ass up. 
 D'Angelo, huh? You know him? 
 At this point, it feels like I do. 
 We sort of moved in together. 
 He seemed like he was different. 
 I have to quit the club. Yes, you do. But not just yet. 
 We need your help. Which is why we came to you. 
 I don't know what else... Keisha was not the first. 
 Unless somebody steps up a little bit, she's not gonna be the last neither. 
 You like that one? 
 Why don't you keep it? 
 Thank you. 
 He's getting into a black Ford Excursion. 'Copy that.' 
 He's pulling out, north on Collington. 
 '11-71.' 
 You got the parallel on the north, I got him on the south. 
 11-71, I got him. Looks like he's going east on Oliver. 
 Some make a livin' doin' killin'... 
 Pass the information or pass the wine Pass the buck or pass the baton But you can't pass the police or the Pentagon... 
 He just parked. East of Oliver. 
 12-10, you keep the eyeball. 
 11-71, take up a position on Federal, west of Montford. 
 I'm coming up from the south. 
 11-71, I copy that. 
 He's just sitting there. 
 ..television and radio stations... 
 He's doubling back. 'Copy.' 
 He's south on Montford. 
 He jumped the light at Preston and Milton and is south on Milton. 
 Be advised that he didn't make it to Chase. 
 11-71, what's your status? 
 'He couldn't have gone past us.' 
 '11-71, nothing on this side.' 
 'Must have went to ground.' 
 Hold your positions. I'll take a look. 
 ..f*ck the constitution Are we part of the solution or are we part of the pollution? 
 Sittin' by and wonderin' why Things ain't the way we like to find them to be To be, for you and for me, the people over there and the ones in between... 
 He called again, same payphone. Same voice? 
 Main stash house, it's got to be. The pattern fits. 
 Who took the call at the projects? Who knows? 
 There was no one on the roof. Sydnor was off with Daniels, chasing Avon in the street. 
 We had a good day too. Kima turned one of the dancers over at Avon's club. 
 The one who's f*cking D'Angelo. 
 This guy's good. We threw everything we had at him. 
 You know what they say, stupid criminals make stupid cops. 
 I'm proud to be chasing this guy. 
 We got four front companies so far, buying up all kinds of sh1t. 
 A club, an apartment building, a funeral home and real estate on the west side of downtown by the Howard Street corridor. 
 Shop fronts and warehouses. 
 Barksdale's name on it? Fronts, mostly. Relatives, some. 
 Mind if I have a seat? 
 He's had the projects for more than a year and it's a money factory. 
 We popped Wee-Bey coming out the other day with 22,000. 
 The boys on the wire were saying it wasn't much of a loss. 
 22? 
 One morning from the towers and the Pit. 
 Add the avenue corners, you're up near 30. 
 Another take for the evening, 60,000. 
 A day? That's 25 million a year, conservatively. 
 Take out 20% for running expenses and spillage and you are still clearing a million dollars a month. 
 So, where does it all go? He shows no flash. 
 He's got no, uh, no house, no car in his name, no jewelry, no clothes. 
 Just front companies and the property. 
 And political contributions. 
 75,000 last month alone, all from his front companies or their listed officers. 
 And that's just at a quick glance. 
 I'm just totaling up the legal contributions. 
 You've got the likes of Damien Price, aide to a state senator, driving out 20,000 in cash from the projects whenever he feels it. 
 I know you don't wanna hear this, but the money is real and it's everywhere. 
 And more than the drugs, it's the money that matters. 
 I ain't f*cked nobody else if that's what you thinking. 
 All right. I mean, f*ck it. If you wanna go, then go! 
 But you could give me a goddamn reason. 
 What do I look like to you? What you mean? 
 What do I look like to you? You look like a girl, a woman. 
 A beautiful woman. You fine. What? 
 I don't look like trash to you? 
 Baby, this ain't about what you do. 
 I don't look like something you could roll up in a rug and throw in the trash? 
 Shardene. 
 Shardene. 
 Shardene! 
 Lieutenant, you paged us? We were almost home. 
 Sit. 
 'Hey, checked my count again.' 'How bad?' 
 'Not too bad, man. 
 'We got hit about 22.' '22? That's all? 
 'All right.' 
 I got towers two, three, five and six and another one labelled "P" for the Pit. 
 Where's one and four? It's on the wire that we took them for 22. 
 You shitheads turned in 15. Where's the rest? 
 Lieutenant, we ain't got... 
 You have till roll call tomorrow to crawl back to whatever rock you hid it under. 
 It comes back and it goes to ECU. 
 This doesn't happen. 
 Not with me. Not with my unit. 
 I wouldn't steal and not tell you about it. 
 This some of Avon's sh1t. 
 You got Avon Barksdale chasing your ass all around town and you still find time to take his sh1t. 
 It's your sh1t now. What I want with that? 
 What anybody want with that, man? 
 How much you asking? We free. 
 Free? 
 I'm saying, I got a little proposition for you. 
 Proposition is, you get four G-packs for free, you give me some better idea on how I can reach Avon. 
 How to contact him? You all just had a game, right? 
 How you get a hold of him to parley? 
 We talk now and then. 
 I page his ass. 
 Okay. Okay. 
 That all you need? A number? I could make do with it. 
 And a code for one of his peoples. 
 What Wee-Bey use, 07? 
 07. 
 What makes you think I ain't gonna take this and throw your ass up outta here? 
 Avon goes down, the projects be open market again, right? 
 Let me understand. 
 Avon loses 100 large to me on a bet, then you bring me some of his sh1t so that I can put your predatory self on his ass. 
 Not his day, is it? 
 f*ck it. 
 f*ck. f*ck. 
 Ah! 
 f*ck it. 
 Where was it? The wheel well. 
 You remember when the bag broke? 
 Think Daniels will believe it? 
 Would you? 
 You didn't believe me. 
 I'm sorry. 
 Savino late. I'm ready to make this money-run, get the f*ck out here. 
 You tired? I'm tired, man, I'm hungry. 
 Me, too. Want something to eat from the diner? 
 You going over there? Get me a cheese steak. 
 You hungry too? I could do a burger. 
 Let me get onions on that, man. 
 You organizing it right? My 50s with my 50s, and my 100s with my 100s? 
 All right, ladies, good night. 
 I see you all tomorrow, on time, you hear? 
 Count this money, baby. 
 What the f*ck? Who's that? 
 Wee-Bey swinging me an emergency call. 
 f*ck. 
 Bey? 
 Yeah. 
 911 call. 
 No, no, no, no. 
 We got rules, right? 
 f*ck. 
 Hey. 
 They had cheese fries, baby. I got you some. 
 Avon, stay down, man. I got you covered.
