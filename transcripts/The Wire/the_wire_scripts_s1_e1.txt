 So, your boy's name is what? Snot. 
 You called the guy Snot? Snotboogie, yeah. 
 "Snotboogie"? He like the name? 
 What? Snotboogie. 
 This kid whose mama went to the trouble of christening him Omar Isaiah Betts? 
 You know, he forgets his jacket... so his nose starts running, and some asshole, instead of giving him a Kleenex, calls him "Snot". 
 So, he's "Snot" forever. 
 Doesn't seem fair. Life just be that way, I guess. 
 So, who shot Snot? 
 I ain't going in no court. 
 m*therf*cker ain't have to put no cap in him. Definitely not. 
 He coulda just whipped his ass, like we always do. 
 I agree. He gonna kill Snot. 
 Snot been doing the same sh1t since I don't know how long. 
 Kill a man over some bullshit. 
 I'm saying, every Friday night in the alley behind the cut-rate, we rolling bones. 
 All the boys from here, we roll till late. 
 Alley crap game, right? 
 And like every time, Snot, he'd fade a few shooters. 
 Play it out till the pot's deep. 
 Then he'd snatch and run. 
 Every time? 
 Couldn't help hisself. 
 Let me understand you. Every Friday night, you and your boys would shoot crap, right? 
 And every Friday night, your pal Snotboogie... he'd wait till there was cash on the ground, then grab the money and run away? 
 You let him do that? 
 We catch him and beat his ass. 
 But ain't nobody ever go past that. 
 I gotta ask you. 
 If every time Snotboogie would grab the money and run away... 
 why'd you even let him in the game? 
 What? 
 If Snotboogie always stole the money, why'd you let him play? 
 Got to. This America, man. 
 If you walk through the garden You better watch your back Well, I beg your pardon Walk the straight and narrow track If you walk with Jesus He'll save your soul 
 You gotta keep the devil Down in the hole All the angels sing About Jesus' mighty sword And they shield you with their wings Keep you close to the Lord Don't pay heed to temptation For his hands are so cold You gotta keep the devil Way down in the hole 
 Way down in the hole Way down in the hole Way down in the hole Way down in the hole 
 Guess what he said. What? 
 "Gotta let him play, this America." No f*cking way. He give you the shooter? 
 Three Newports and a Grape Nehi he's grand juried. It's down, Bunk. 
 Barksdale's in Part 12, right? 
 Project murder, Westside. 
 Which one, now? Never mind. 
 Let's sit in on it for a bit. Where you gonna be? 
 I'm gonna drop this off on Nathan, then I'm going to the office. 
 Don't answer no phones, Bunk. 
 Is that your signature on that photo array card? 
 Yes. 
 And your initials, next to the photo? Yes. 
 Mr. Gant, do you see the man you identified from that photo array card... sitting in the courtroom today? 
 He's right there. 
 For the record, the witness has identified the defendant, D'Angelo Barksdale. 
 Your witness. Thank you. 
 Just one question, Mr. Gant. 
 Had you ever seen this young man before the day in question? 
 No, no. 
 No further questions, your honor. 
 You're excused, Mr. Gant. Call your next witness. 
 State calls Nakeisha Lyles, your honor. 
 Do you promise to tell the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth? 
 I do. 
 Can you state your name, please? Nakeisha Lyles. 
 And are you employed? Yes, I am. 
 And what is your occupation, Ms. Lyles? I'm a security guard. 
 And were you employed as a security guard on May 4th, the day of the shooting? 
 Uh-huh. 
 What were your duties on that date? I was in the booth of 221. 
 The guard booth in the lobby of the Fremont Avenue high-rise? 
 Yes. 
 Behind bulletproof glass, with a clear view of the lobby? 
 Yeah. Good. 
 Ms. Lyles, I know this may be difficult, but can you tell us what you saw? 
 Erm, a man, he was waiting for the elevator, when another man just starts beating on him... and like, the one man, he got knocked down... 
 The victim? No, the man with the gun. 
 The man who was knocked down had a gun. 
 And do you see that man in the courtroom today? 
 Nope. 
 Excuse me? 
 He ain't here. 
 You don't...? 
 You testified. 
 Do you remember when Detective Barlow showed you this photo array? 
 Yeah. 
 Good. I call your attention to your initials which identify this photo as the man who shot Mr. Blanchard. 
 Did you write your initials above that photograph? 
 He ain't the one that did the shooting. 
 But you identified him. 
 He looked like the boy that did it. 
 See, the one that did it, I saw him come in the building a week later. 
 You saw someone else you thought did the shooting? 
 Right, a week later. 
 Hm. Ms. Lyles, when you spoke with the detectives you never said anything about... I tried. I called Detective... erm...Yeah, Detective Barlow on May 13th at 2pm. 
 But he didn't call me back. Nicely done. 
 You called Detective Barlow? Yeah, twice. 
 Yeah, I wrote it down in the log. 
 I need a price for pressure-treated. '$14.' 
 That's the price that you were going to quote me? 
 Do you feel that, Mikey? That is my f*cking dick in your ear. 
 'Oh, that's nice.' Hang on, you f*cking thief. What's up? 
 You been down the hall? 
 What? Your case just hit the wall. 
 Barksdale's crew, they turned it. 
 Two eyewitnesses and a statement. No f*cking way, pal. 
 You listen to me, you little sh1t, there is no way in hell I am paying that. 
 You use my car to chauffeur that dusty bitch. 
 Yo, ease up. You don't understand. 
 I did it for that man and he do this. Getting heated ain't gonna help. 
 'Greggs, what's she saying?' It ain't what she says. 
 'Yeah? What do you say?' 
 I say we wait, shithead. 
 That's him. All right, easy, girl. 
 Yo, Herc, you got that? 'Yeah, we see.' 
 Are the uniforms on the horn? 
 'They're on hold.' 
 That's Ghost. 
 All right, good, Tiff. 
 Now tell me what I'm seeing. 
 He gonna get little Mike. Then what? 
 Mike come back with the money. 
 Wait on the drop, take the car when it's deep in the block. 
 I don't want no foot chase. 
 'Copy. 
 'Got it.' 
 Go, go, go. The driver's mine. 
 Get the house on the left. 
 Get back. Get on the ground. Get down. 
 Put your hands behind your head. Get your hands up. 
 Shut the engine. Get that m*therf*cker round the corner. 
 Hand the keys out. Drop the keys out of the car. 
 Drop them down. Get out of the car. 
 Get down right here, right here. Get down. 
 Passenger, put your hands out of the window. 
 Both hands out of the car window. Use your right hand, open the door. 
 Slowly. Step out of the car. Step out of the car! 
 Down on the ground. Don't move. 
 Down on the ground. 
 That's it, take his ass to jail. 
 You got him, Carv? I got him. 
 Look at this sh1t. Cross your legs. 
 Look at this. 
 You see what he did? Do you see what he did?! 
 Why he throw the gun on my car? sh1t gonna scratch the paint! 
 Stay in the car. Tell him to leave my car be! 
 Stay in the f*cking car. That sh1t just ain't right. 
 Whatcha doing with something like that? 
 What you got here? 
 Shoulda seen the way this bitch was looking at me, Kima. 
 Ugly little fucker almost sh1t his pants he was so scared. 
 Right? 
 Two guns, remember? 
 Two? It's all good, Kima, ease up. 
 All rise. 
 Part 12 of the Circuit Court of Baltimore City is now in session. 
 Be seated. 
 Madame Forelady, you have a unanimous verdict? 
 As to the defendant D'Angelo Barksdale, how say you to the charge of murder in the first degree? 
 Not guilty. 
 How say you to the charge of murder in the second degree? 
 Not guilty. Yes! Whoo! 
 Be seated. 
 It's you, daddy, yeah! Order. 
 At least you made 'em work for it. Be seated. 
 The jury is to be thanked for its services in this case. 
 Deputies will return defendant Barksdale to pre-trial for processing prior to his release. 
 Think I give a f*ck? I'll be chalking you off one night. 
 You have a nice day. Yo, Stringer, let's go. 
 Detective? 
 Detective? 
 Detective. Judge asked to speak with you. 
 What the hell happened out there? We lost. 
 Were you on this? The case? 
 No, it was Barlow, with an assist from McLarney. 
 If it was Barlow's case, why are you in court? 
 No reason. 
 You just like coming to court on murders you don't work? For the thrill of it? 
 When you start coming with the customers, it's time to get out of the business. 
 You shouldn't talk dirty now you're a judge. 
 Now I'm a judge, I can say anything I damn please. 
 That Barksdale kid, he's a cousin to Avon Barksdale. 
 Who? Avon Barksdale, Stringer Bell. 
 The crew that's been running Franklin Terrace. 
 Stringer Bell? 
 In court with the legal pad and glasses, scaring the sh1t out of every witness. 
 Him and his crew - Wee-Bey, Savino, Stinkum. 
 I saw them. You think about clearing the court? 
 On what basis? It's an open court in a free nation of laws. 
 I thought it was Baltimore. 
 Barksdale has five out of seven towers in the Terrace. 
 That's ten stairwells in five high-rises, going 24/7 for dope and coke. 
 That's just the towers. 
 The low-rises, corners, they're his too. 
 How do you know? 
 Everybody knows. "Everybody"? 
 Everybody on the Westside. 
 Barksdale and Bell, they're the new power. 
 They've dropped 10 or 12 bodies in as many months. 
 Beat three cases in court doing the same thing. 
 Who's working on them? In the department? 
 Nobody, really. 
 We're a little busy doing street rips. Community policing and all that. 
 So, if it's not your case, why do you care? 
 Who said I did? 
 One more time. One more time. 
 Stop playing... 
 f*ck me. 
 You got submission numbers for the ECU? 
 Nope. Get 'em. 
 Why me? You want the collar, do the submissions. 
 You giving me the start? It's your turn. 
 What's the extension for ECU? 
 Do I look like your bitch? 
 We taking the Mercedes? No, I promised my girl. 
 Car's in her name. 
 Narcotics. 
 Lieutenant. Line two. Here you go. 
 f*ck me, I cannot type. Who the f*ck can? 
 Millennium gone, and we still f*ck around with Smith Corona. 
 We need them computers. They promised to train us a year ago. 
 What would an ignorant m*therf*cker like you do with a computer? 
 Trade stocks and sh1t. Jerk off, you mean. 
 We get them computers hooked up, Herc'll be deep into some p0rn and Kima'll still be bangin' out her 24s on that old piece of sh1t. 
 Gotta go upstairs. What's up? 
 Deputy's throwing some piss-fit. 
 Major know? He's up there now. 
 With a mouthful of piss, probably. 
 Our major don't know what that tastes like? 
 It's the chain-of-command, the sh1t rolls downhill. 
 m*therf*cker, we talking about piss. Piss does too, think about it. 
 sh1t rolls, piss trickles. Downhill, though. 
 You don't know that for sure... 
 Not to change the subject on you two charmers, but why are there only two ECU numbers? Dope and guns. 
 Two guns, right? 
 That's three. f*ck it, Kima. 
 You want a job done right, you gotta do it yourself. 
 He means we are an effective deterrent on the war on drugs when we are on the street. f*cking M*therf*ckers up. 
 Indeed. f*ck the paperwork. 
 Collect bodies, split heads. 
 Split them wide. The Western District way. 
 Aye. You heroic M*therf*ckers kill me. 
 Fighting the war on drugs, one brutality case at a time. 
 Girl, you can't call this sh1t a war. 
 Why not? Wars end. 
 You gonna write that down? 
 How happy am I to see my pager go off with your call number? 
 Smoke 'em if you got 'em because this m*therf*cker is as ripe as they get. 
 We aren't up, Nolan's squad is up. I know. 
 But you answered the f*cking phone. 
 Got to pay down my credit cards. Not off him. 
 I leave you alone, what do you do? All right, I heard you. 
 Say the words, Bunk. 
 Come on, man. Speak to me. 
 So, you gonna cut and run on the Bunk? That sh1t ain't right, Jimmy. 
 All right, then, this is my case. My file. 
 This sh1t comes back a murder, you ain't gotta do sh1t but stand there and laugh. 
 You happy now, bitch? 
 This'll teach you to give a f*ck when it ain't your turn. 
 It ain't even gonna be a murder. 
 This m*therf*cker probably came in to take a sh1t and just fell out. 
 I bet there's nothing to it. 
 You hope. Where you going? 
 Back to the office, where I belong. 
 You moldering m*therf*cker, don't even think about coming back a murder. 
 Don't even think of that sh1t. 
 By tomorrow, Lieutenant. Don't fail me. 
 Major's pissed. 
 He should be. He didn't have answers for the deputy's questions. 
 About what? Avon Barksdale. 
 Who? 
 That's what I said. Who the f*ck is Avon Barksdale? 
 According to the right honorable Judge Phelan, a Westside player who indulges in the occasional murder. 
 Now, as of today, I never heard of Mr. Barksdale, but by tomorrow... 
 All right, what do we know? 
 The judge says he has the Westside high-rises. 
 The Terrace, mostly. 
 Sounds like a bunch of bullshit to me. Maybe so. 
 It's gotta be tonight? Major wants it filed by morning. 
 Call Andrews at DEA. See what they have on this mope. 
 What about Homicide? Homicide major was in the meeting. 
 His people will be scrambling to get something, too. 
 I doubt they'll be willing to share. 
 Barksdale, Avon. 
 Got a DOB? 
 Jay. Where the f*ck you been all day? 
 Drinking, crack smoking. Whoring myself on the streets of Baltimore. 
 OK. Just so you have an excuse. 
 But your f*ck of a partner caught a call. 
 Yeah, I saw him out there. Yeah, what'd he get? 
 Decomp in a vacant apartment. f*ck. 
 Nolan's squad was up, that one's theirs. 
 It's a decomp. It may come back a natural death. 
 You think? In the Poe Homes, no f*cking way. 
 Hold up. Major wants to talk to you before you roll out. 
 What about? f*ck should I know, I'm only your sergeant. 
 Sit the f*ck down, Detective. 
 Something wrong? 
 Put your ass in the chair. 
 You see these, McNulty, you see them? These are for you. 
 These are for you for as long as it takes me to get even. 
 Major, what...? 
 Don't "Major" me, you backstabbing, smartass piece of sh1t. 
 What the f*ck you doing at the courthouse? 
 Why the f*ck are you talking to some shitbag judge? 
 These are for you, McNulty. 
 This one over here is going up your narrow f*cking Irish ass. 
 And this bad boy is in your f*cking eye. 
 I'm answering questions about some project nigger I never heard of who's beat my unit out of ten murders. 
 Three. They only beat three in court. I got the deputy asking about ten. 
 No, they did ten, we only charged them with three. 
 You're full of sh1t. 
 Sir, you can check the files. 
 Maurice Scroggins, Toreen Boyd, Roland Leggett. 
 The girl they found in the stairwell in Saratoga, Collette something. 
 Major, these guys are real. 
 They beat me up on the Gerard Bogue case just like they did Barlow. 
 Scroggins? I don't have an H-file on Scroggins. 
 He was last year, summer. Two in the back of the head, low-rise courtyard. 
 Let me understand something. 
 You are having the deputy bust my balls over a prior-year case? 
 Is this what I need from you, you insubordinate little f*ck? 
 Major, I'm really sorry. 
 Phelan, he and I, we...we go back a little. 
 He wanted to know about the crew in his court... 
 I had to go upstairs and explain to the deputy why he's getting calls about murders that don't mean a sh1t. 
 Look, sir, this judge, he f*cks me up. 
 He asks me a question and I answer it. 
 I didn't know he was gonna call anybody. 
 You have my attention, Detective. 
 My complete, undivided attention. 
 Yes, sir. Where you going? 
 I'm eight to four. No. 
 You're typing. Sir? 
 Deputy wants a report on his desk at 0800. 
 A report? Clean, no typos. 
 Make it look right, then put my name on it. 
 Do you want to reference all the murders or should I soft-pedal that? 
 f*cking horse is out the barn door, right? 
 Let's try not to make me look stupid twice. 
 And when you list the cases, put a little dot next to each one. 
 Deputy likes dots. I'm sorry, Major, really. 
 Niggers crazy in there, yo. Eastside, Westside, everybody beefing. 
 You ain't got no problem, right? Hell no, we deep in there. 
 Mm. 
 Y'all deep down at the courthouse, too. 
 I didn't know what the f*ck would happen. 
 I'm wondering how y'all gonna make it happen for me, you know? 
 Slick what y'all did with that security lady. That sh1t was tight, yo. 
 Let's walk. 
 What's the rule? I know the rule. 
 Say it. Don't talk in the car. 
 Or on the phone or any place that ain't ours or to anybody who ain't us. But it was just you. 
 It's your f*cking truck. 
 Don't talk in the car. 
 My friends, yeah 
 Feel it's their appointed duty 
 They keep trying to tell me... 
 What about Marcel? 
 No, I ain't inviting Marcel. 
 You want him out? I really don't give a sh1t what you do. 
 Actually, no. 
 Go down and make that m*therf*cker pay for his drinks. 
 The bum. 
 Oh, boy! 
 How you doing? What's up, D? Good to see you. 
 What up, man? I ain't seen you in a long time. 
 Yo, you remember the cop that tried to pin Gerard on little Kevin? 
 Which one? White detective, black hair. 
 The one that was knocking on all the doors. What about him? 
 He showed up in court to watch. 
 Word. 
 What are you talking to that m*therf*cker for? Damn, D. 
 He say anything? No, just sat in the back. 
 What up? What you got? 
 Huh? Come here, I got something for you. 
 You must feel good. You know how that go. 
 Say what? I'm saying, you know, jail ain't no joke. 
 I don't know sh1t about jail. 
 I don't plan on knowing sh1t about jail, you feel me? 
 You wanna talk about jail, go sit down next to Marcel. 
 He just got home. True, you right. 
 Sit your ass down. 
 I know it ain't go good. That nigger Pooh, he caught me off guard. 
 He came at me like he was crazy. So you shoot the m*therf*cker? 
 I'm saying, it was him or me. 
 You in our building. 
 You got people on both stairs, more motherfucking people in the court. 
 And you got a gun. So, what I'm trying to figure out is... how the f*ck you shoot this nigger in front of the security booth with them people around? 
 This nigger was coming at me like he was trying to end me. 
 This ain't about him. 
 It's about you. 
 You can't play him out of that lobby. You can't take a beating. 
 So the first thing you do, you get all emotional. 
 You pull your gun out, you do some dumb sh1t... that now we got to work around. 
 I know. 
 You ain't said one motherfucking thing I want to hear. 
 You right. You right. I mean, I gotta start thinking more. 
 You say that all the time and you right. 
 But I'm saying though, I mean... the sh1t y'all pulled with that security lady. 
 It was tight. I mean, that state lawyer. 
 I ain't never seen a white woman turn so red. 
 You should've been there. 
 Yo, man, you family, OK? 
 But that sh1t cost money. It cost time and money. 
 You gonna make that right? 
 Most def, you gonna see. 
 When I get back to the tower, I'm gonna push them niggers. 
 All right. 
 Come here. 
 Don't walk out of here like that. 
 You family, all right? 
 You know it's always love. Yeah. 
 Type quieter. 
 You didn't have to wait up, love. 
 Your boy have a heart attack? 
 No, I went that way but Doc Frazier didn't bite when this popped up. 
 You seriously f*cked. Speaking of f*cked, why are you here? 
 I did bad, Bunk. It wasn't my fault. 
 Really. 
 Judge Phelan pulled me up when the jury let the Barksdale kid go. 
 Him being a judge and all, I let go of some sh1t. 
 He raise a stink? 
 Major got busted by the Deputy Ops and I gotta have a report by morning. 
 There you go, giving a f*ck when it ain't your turn to give a f*ck. 
 Look at 'em, Cole. 
 Don't it make your dick bust concrete to be in the same room with two noble, selfless public servants? I know I'm proud. 
 Tell me you put this one down. 
 Of course not. Of course your partner has to go to the courthouse and lay our business out in front of a judge. 
 So you heard? 
 Major calls me, says I should get in early, read over your shoulder. 
 It's got dots. Deputy loves dots. 
 f*ck you and your dots. 
 All I did was answer the guy's questions. He's a f*cking judge. 
 And the deputy's the f*cking deputy. 
 And he, not the judge, has what's left of your beshitted career in his hands. 
 He says so, you're walking foot in the Western tomorrow. 
 f*ck it, I came from Western. Where don't you want to go, asshole? 
 Evidence Control? Personnel? 
 Headquarter Security? The boat. 
 The marine unit? 
 Yeah, those diesel fumes, they make me seasick. 
 That's good, keep it up. 
 I'll go this against 10, you're riding the boat, midnight shift. 
 Listen to the man, Jimmy. 
 Yo, Stringer! 
 You here early. Yeah, I'm on my game today. 
 Eggy put out testers? Uh-huh. D... 
 New deal today. 
 You going out on point, picking up business in the Pit. 
 What? You the man in the low-rises. 
 The low-rises? You got Ronnie Mo in the Pit. 
 Ronnie Mo got 851 this morning. 
 Why you put me in the low-rises? I had a tower since summer. 
 Yeah, you had a tower. 
 And you might have a tower again if you can keep your mind to sh1t. 
 This is f*cked up. 
 You show us you can run the Pit and you'll be back uptown soon enough. 
 My uncle know about this? 
 What do you think? 
 Yo, Bey. Yo. 
 Give little cousin here a ride down the way. 
 Have your people deal with Daniels. Right. 
 You gonna send your man McNulty? Tell him about chain-of-command. 
 Tell him yourself, he's dead to me. 
 Yo, you looking for Ronnie Mo, he uptown. I know. 
 You D, right? 
 Wasn't you in the towers? Yeah. 
 Why they put you down here, yo? You mess with the count or something? 
 I killed a nigger. 
 Last call on green top, last call. 
 Yeah? 
 Major? 
 Counting what we got from the DEA, how much do we have on this guy? 
 Lieutenant, I'm holding how many pages? Four, sir. 
 Rawls had a f*cking phone book. They got ten open murder files. 
 If we get ten shots at him, we'd have more than a fat file. 
 I said that. They can't put him down for murder so they're getting us to do their work. Not getting us, they got us. 
 They got you, in fact. Excuse me, sir? 
 Dawson has the York and Cator case, that leaves you. 
 sh1t. Look, set something up with Homicide and whoever you want from your squads. 
 State's Attorney? Yeah, we should call them, too. 
 f*cking shitstorm. 
 Lieutenant, line three. 
 Deputy Ops. 
 Here we go. 
 Close that for me. 
 What's the coffee do? 
 Give it that money feel, so it don't seem so white. 
 Leastways, you got it on both sides this time. 
 All right, give me the real. 
 Wait, why are we gonna use real money? 
 We're not burning no lemon street chumps here. Feel me? 
 I'm down. 
 You down? Johnny's down. 
 You got that gig. Can I get a one-on-one? 
 Yo, Poot. 
 Yo, Wallace. 
 This the way Ronnie Mo set it up? 
 Yeah. Man, this is f*cked up. 
 You can't serve your customers straight up after taking they money. 
 Somebody snapping pictures, they got the whole damn thing. 
 You get paid, you send they ass off around the building, yo. 
 Then you serve. All right? 
 We gotta start tightening up, man. No more short cuts. 
 What's your count? I'm up 270. 
 You want to count it. 
 I don't know how you do sh1t up in the towers. 
 But down here, you want to count it. sh1t. 
 Hey, yo, yo, ho, ho, ho! 
 Y'all niggers been burned. Huh? 
 
 
 
 "Huh"? That's what you got to say? "Huh"? 
 This look like money, m*therf*cker? 
 Money be green. Money feel like money. 
 That sh1t look green to you? It got a dead f*cking president on it. 
 I don't give a f*ck about the president. 
 That sh1t ain't money. He ain't no president. 
 What you mean? Hamilton. He ain't no president. 
 Nigger, is you crazy? 
 No ugly-ass white man get his face on legal tender except he president. 
 This sh1t happen again, you off the money. You hear me? 
 You ain't even gonna be serving. 
 You be on the end of Vine Street, sucking on a 40, yelling "five-0". 
 You hear me? 
 Get the f*ck outta here. 
 That it? 
 No. 
 You need to pace that sh1t, man. 
 Johnny, man, you hear me? I'm cool. 
 No, man, you gonna fall out, slamming that sh1t like that one of these days, boy. 
 Man, I'm trying to give you a little game, man... but you want to pretend like you know something. 
 I know a lot, Bubs. 
 No, no, you...you green. 
 I'm trying to get you... I'm trying to get you brown, man... but you still green. 
 You gonna make me brown? 
 Yo, Bubs? 
 Let me do the scam tomorrow. 
 Come on, man, I'm ready. 
 Yo, I'm brown. 
 sh1t, man, you ain't even f*cking beige. 
 Buy-busts. Yes, sir. 
 No long surveillances, no Kel recorders, no DNRs. 
 I want to get in and out as quickly as possible. 
 That makes sense. Phelan isn't just a judge, he's a political entity. 
 If he asks for something, I want to give it to him. 
 Why is he asking about this Barksdale? 
 He watched his state's attorney get beat up in his court this week. 
 Lost a murder case. We lose cases all the time. 
 But a judge happens to be asking about this one. 
 Now, who you using? Lead detective? 
 Greggs, she's my best right now. I know her? 
 CID for four months. Came over from Eastern DEU. 
 Who's Homicide sending? That's up to Major Rawls. 
 I wouldn't be surprised if you get McNulty. 
 You know McNulty? Not really. 
 He mouthed off to the judge in the first place. 
 He talked to the judge? That's my understanding. 
 So, if he comes over on this, watch your back. 
 You need anything, you ask me. 
 I'll give you all the help I can. But no surprises. 
 Yes, sir. 
 Keep me briefed. 
 Hi, McNulty, City Homicide. Is anyone expecting you? 
 Yeah, Special Agent Fitzhugh, Squad Five. 
 He's expecting me, can I...? Not without an escort. 
 All right. 
 Agent Fitzhugh to the front. 
 Hey, Fitz. Hey, brother. 
 She can spot a bad one. Nothing personal. 
 You know how they are with security. I know how they are with locals. 
 What's up, G-man? Good stuff, brother. 
 Your man gave us a hell of a case. 
 Comes to informants, Jimmy, you can pick 'em. 
 He's one of the better CI's I've worked. 
 You up on a wire? That and more. 
 'So, like, he be talking like he got some kind of record deal.' 
 'Man, please.' 'That nigger. 
 'The pussy has you.' Jesus Christ. 
 Pretty f*cking great, huh? How'd you get this on tape? 
 That's not tape. That's live, brother. 
 That's live? 
 Live from a three-story walk-up on Homer Avenue in the bottoms of Pimlico. 
 This is going on right now? As we speak. 
 How? Fiber-optic lensing. 
 Camera's behind a hole in the wall. So small it looks like a nail might've made it. 
 Where's the mic? These fuckers sound great. 
 Two remotes behind the baseboard heating ducts. 
 That's about 3K of raw on the table today. 
 We followed it from New York. You're up in New York on this? 
 We could be. 
 We're backing into some Dominicans up there. 
 We could have a Title three on 'em right now if we wanted. 
 Wrong war, brother. 
 Most of the squad's gone to counterterrorism. 
 This is the last drug case pending. 
 I gotta shut it down by the end of the month. 
 You guys are getting out of drugs? Yeah, for a while. 
 We don't have the manpower to stay on anything big. 
 Not since those towers fell. 
 We don't have enough love in our hearts for two wars? 
 Joke's on us, huh? I guess so. Still... 
 You give great case. I wish you could've worked it with us. 
 Got some Tech Nine over here. Tech Nine. 
 That's it, here's 20, hook it up. 
 Two and two. 
 Hold up. What? 
 Just two and two. Come on, man, I ain't got time for this. 
 I gave you 20, man. You gave me 20? 
 One and a short three. So you get, two... 
 Seven! Hold up. 
 I get seven back. Come on, man. Calm down. 
 Hold up, hold up, you f*cking me up. Chill out. 
 You dropping sh1t on the ground? 
 Hold up. I ain't got all day. 
 Come on, man, it's easy. Let's rewind, man. 
 What the f*ck is you doing? Look at this sh1t. Look, nigger. 
 That's the m*therf*cker. Who? 
 The white boy right there. Poot, grab that m*therf*cker. 
 The white boy. 
 D, man! Hold up, man. 
 Hey! 
 Hey! Stop that white m*therf*cker. 
 Yeah, m*therf*cker, yeah, nigger. f*ck that. 
 What are you doing, man? 
 Calm down, man. 
 Making me run, what is wrong with you? 
 What, man, why you f*cking with me? sh1t. 
 This the m*therf*cker with the make-believe money. 
 Seen his ass drop it and sh1t. 
 Wasn't me. m*therf*cker. 
 It was this nigger, I saw him. Get the f*ck up. 
 All right, listen, I'm sorry. f*ck that. 
 m*therf*cker burned us for $30. Take him to Franklin Avenue and throw his ass onto the motherfucking expressway. 
 All right, listen, I'm f*cking sorry. I f*cked up, man. 
 What you got on you? Just the 10 I dropped, man, the real one. 
 Well?! What's up? 
 f*ck it. 
 Hell, yeah. 
 We'll work out of Narcotics, with Kima keeping the file. 
 We'll copy everything to Ronnie at the courthouse. 
 Fine with us. 
 McNulty and Santangelo will work on the open murders. 
 Kima and my people will do hand-to-hand stuff in the Terrace. 
 Buy-bust, quick and dirty. 
 We put years over top of some of these people, we'll roll a few. 
 You're not gonna get Avon Barksdale or Stringer Bell on street rips. 
 You don't know that. These guys are good. 
 They've got everyone running scared. 
 What do you suggest? 
 Surveillance teams, DNRs, asset investigation. 
 Gather string till we find a way in. 
 Either a wired CI or a Title three. That's what makes this case. 
 Is that what you told the judge? 
 OK, so I'm an asshole for that. But I'm right about this much. 
 No mics, no wires. We do this fast and clean and simple. 
 Then you don't do it at all. What the...? 
 You could've had this fight before calling the State's Attorney's office. 
 Let me ask you something. What do we know about Avon Barksdale? 
 What do we know? 
 The guy's owned all of Franklin Terrace for a year. 
 What do we have on him right now? A DOB? A sheet? 
 A B of I photo? 
 We don't have a f*cking photo of the guy. 
 Gimme a break, Jimmy. 
 Two days ago no one on this f*cking floor knew his name. 
 Now he's some criminal mastermind. 
 sh1t, I say we go to the Terrace and f*ck some people up. 
 You don't need a prosecutor, you need a f*cking referee. 
 When you know how you're playing this, yell. 
 We know how we're playing it. 
 My people are going down to do hand-to-hands. 
 Detectives McNulty and Santangelo are going to review old murder files and try to make a fresh prosecution. 
 I'll get us more manpower but this case is not going to sprawl. 
 A month from now, we're all gonna be back at our day jobs. 
 Fine. Bring me your hand-to-hands. 
 Anything on the murders, take to Ilene Nathan in violent crimes. I'll clue her in. 
 Anything else? 
 One last thing. 
 No one does anything on the street without me knowing about it first. 
 Chain-of-command, Detective. 
 That's how we do things down this end of the hall. 
 If she's f*cking you on visitation, take her ass to court. 
 Judge gives me three weekends out of four, I still need her to cooperate. 
 You know, move it around, so when I have to work through a weekend, she switches. 
 The judge gives me three weekends but no flex, I still lose. 
 You two can't talk this through? No. 
 How is it you always got the whole world pissed off at you? 
 You know Daniels? Narcotics? 
 What about him? He's running this detail. 
 Watch your ass then. He a snake? 
 No, he ain't that. But he's a company man. 
 You know, a prospect. 
 Grapevine says the next district to open up is his. 
 Shortlist for major? 
 He's black, still young, he hasn't pissed anybody off. 
 sh1t, he even has a law degree. No sh1t. 
 University of Baltimore, but still. He's gonna f*ck this Barksdale thing up. 
 How's that? Buy-bust? 
 He's pissing in the wind. You already f*cked it up, Jimmy. 
 You made it happen. 
 I feel like that m*therf*cker at the end of Bridge On The River Kwai. 
 What the f*ck did I do? The bridge of what? 
 You ain't seen that movie? Mm-mm. 
 I am f*cked. 
 f*cked is me. 
 God damn it, you gonna make me go another round. 
 Two more. 
 Fits nice... 
 It's all in the game. It was only a couple of dollars. 
 It ain't the money. But we f*cked him up bad. 
 It's the message, D. 
 You can't show no weakness. 
 Still, I'm saying. What? 
 Hm? 
 String. Yo, Stringer! 
 Operate around the clock Why don't you come in? 
 You ain't touched that drink. You want some company? 
 I ain't no john. Good, 'cause I ain't no whore. 
 I'm not a regular, OK? 
 I work for Stringer. He pay you, don't he? 
 Come on, buy me a drink. 
 How much? 20. 
 I drink slow. 
 Maybe another time. 
 Buy me a drink, honey? How about you buy me a drink? 
 Carla. One here. 
 Hey. 
 Where you at? Where you think? 
 You late for work? A little. 
 How much you got left? Girl, please. 
 Ten pages and all the footnotes. When's it due? 
 Tomorrow, beginning of class. 
 Long night for you. 
 Long night for me. 
 I'll pick up some coffee. 
 So, I drive all the way down to Liberty Road at two in the damn morning, on a midnight shift. 
 I got two murders and a police shooting going down, to do what? 
 To get a goddamn mouse out of my wife's closet. Can you imagine that sh1t? 
 So what did you do? 
 What the f*ck you think? I got the mouse out and drove back to work. 
 Couldn't do nothing else. 
 Nadine out of her mind over this little-ass field mouse. 
 She's up on the chair and sh1t like some goddamn cartoon. 
 How did you catch the mouse? Catch him? I lit his ass up. 
 You shot the mouse? With your nine? Mm-hm. 
 First shot killed my wife's dress shoe. 
 Got him with the second. 
 What? 
 You shot a mouse with your service weapon? 
 Yeah. 
 What'd you do with the carcass? I cleaned it up, you know. 
 I thought about leaving that little m*therf*cker as a warning to others. 
 f*ck me. 
 It's 3:30 in the morning. I'm supposed to be early relief. 
 Jimmy, man, I gotta change my clothes at least, come on. 
 I'm gonna do this case. 
 What? 
 I'm gonna do this case the way it should be done. 
 It's a buy-bust, get in and get out. 
 f*ck that. Jimmy. 
 Let's call it a night. 
 Hi, Bubs. 
 Thought you was still locked up. 
 Nope. 
 How long you been home? 
 It's been three months. 
 You don't write, you don't call. 
 Who's he? 
 A friend. 
 Is he gonna make it? 
 You still working drugs? 
 Downtown, yeah. 
 I got something for you. 
 Last call! Ohh... ! f*ck. 
 Found body. 200, Block Amity. 
 I'm a little thin today, boss. 
 The whole squad's a little thin, remember? 
 We're down a man since your partner got himself detailed. 
 Yeah, yeah, yeah. 
 I got it. 
 Jesus. 
 How you doing, Bobby? Bunk, what's going on, man? 
 We got one or two shots to the head. 
 No witnesses, no suspects. 
 A .380 casing on the ground there. 
 Do me a favor, bag that for me. 
 So, who called it in? No one. 21 Post found him. 
 It's a William Gant, 42, no, 43 years old... Er, address on Schroeder. 
 You got pictures? Yeah. 
 OK, let's roll him. 
 'Mr. Gant, do you see the man you identified sitting in the courtroom today?' 
 He's right there.
