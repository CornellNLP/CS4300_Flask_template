 Oh, nothing. 
 I'm just, uh, crunching some numbers over here and if my calculations are correct, it is way worse than we ever imagined. 
 Sue, I might have to get a job. 
 Ew! 
 Blob! Ah, ahh! 
 Sorry! 
 What... what are you doing, man? 
 What are you doing? We discussed this! 
 No sh1tting in front of each other's girlfriends. 
 I thought we were on the same page, buddy. 
 Go finish up out the window. 
 God! 
 Girlfriend? 
 Well... 
 I... is it? Are we? 
 Kevin, I'd love to be your girlfriend. 
 Really? 
 Mhm! 
 All right! 
 Hey, why don't we do something fun this weekend? 
 Yeah, I would love to, Sue, but I literally can't afford to do anything. 
 Mm. How much money do you have? 
 Ten cents. 
 Kevin, that's a penny. 
 Oh, damn it! 
 I have to redo all this now. 
 Wait, I have an idea!

 You are a god damn genius, Sue. 
 A real G-D-G. Woohoo! 
 All right, you keep your eyes out for the boys in blue, I'm gonna go grab the cheddar. 
 What? No, Kevin, it's a wishing well. 
 A... a what? 
 A wishing well.

 Thank you for responding semi-promptly, Mr. Pacalioglu. 
 Yeah, well, you know, to be fair, you called me literally right as I was sliding a s'mizza in the oven, so that's kinda on you. 
 As I'm sure you're aware, the Dalworf is one of the finest hotels in Manhattan. 
 Our guests expect the highest standards of luxury. 
 Any dip in that quality, however small, is an absolute travesty! 
 And a smear on the good name of the Dalworf Hotel! 
 It's unacceptable; this is the Dalworf for f*ck's sake! 
 I do apologize; we're under a lot of stress at the moment. 
 It's okay; no apology necessary. 
 The penthouse suite is being haunted. 
 It's an absolute nightmare in there, and we have a guest arriving in 48 hours. 
 I'm willing to give you 500 dollars right now to get rid of this ghost before our VIP guest arrives at the end of the weekend. 
 VIP, huh? Anybody I know? 
 I'm not at liberty to say who. 
 That would be uncouth. 
 Is it Mayor Meyer? 
 Trust me, you'll never guess. 
 Is it James McAvoy? 
 Just get it done. 
 ♪ 
 Gotcha. 
 Herrooo!?

 Fancy hotel ghost?

 I'm not sure how you were being a dick. 
 This place looks awesome. 
 Boo! 
 (screaming) 
 Oh, my God. Oh, Sue! 
 What are you... what are you doing here? 
 Well, I was thinking about that vacation, and you need money, so I thought I'd kill two birds with one stone. 
 Okay, so there are ghost birds in here? 
 No! 
 Where are they? 
 I'm the ghost! 
 I'm the one haunting the suite! 
 Oh. 
 This way you get paid, and we get the suite to ourselves the whole weekend. 
 Sue, that is stealing. 
 Also, it's f*cking brilliant. 
 (laughing) 
 Yeah! 
 Right? 
 And, check it out. 
 (gasping) Oh my God. 
 Is that what I think it is? 
 Yes. 
 Fancy hotel bathrobe. 
 Oh my gosh! Oh, Sue! 
 Robes like this are for kings and princes! 
 And now I'm one of them. 
 Oh, it's like wearing a jacket made out of lotion! 
 Oh, Sue. 
 We are gonna have so much fun! 
 Yeah! 
 (knocking) 
 What's that? Is that the door? 
 I'll get it. 
 (giggling) 
 Hi... 
 Uh, oh. 
 Hi, can I help you? 
 Yes, young man. I believe you can. 
 Okay, listen. 
 I... I don't know anything about Amish culture, but if you died on one of your, like, Rumsteiner things... 
 Holy sh1t! 
 It's Abraham Lincoln! 
 What? 
 That's right! 
 I must say, I do not appreciate you two throwing this in a fountain. 
 Yeah. That was her idea. 
 I'm a... listen, uh, Your Excellency. 
 I would be honored to help you finish your unfinished business, but can we, you know, like, pencil it in on Monday? 
 Kevin! 
 Will you please excuse us for a moment, Mr. President? 
 Certainly. 
 Just one second. 
 Kevin, he's the President of the United States. 
 He, like, brought the country together, and you know, freed the slaves? 
 Do you have any idea how hard it would be to help Abraham Lincoln solve his unfinished business? 
 Oh my God, you want me to end all racism? 
 What? Uh, heavens no. 
 You want the complete reunification of the north and the south? 
 No, no, no. Nothing like that. 
 That's a pipe dream, young lady. 
 I'd just kinda like to see the end of that play. 
 Ohh. 
 ♪ 
 I've loved theater since I was but a young boy in Illinois. 
 Back then, the fields of corn were my stage. 
 I used to make little actor figurines out of twigs and cow sh1t. 
 But alas, being an actor in those days, well, it was quite difficult. 
 Truth be told, and I always tell it, I didn't have the discipline. 
 So I decided to become president. 
 Oh! 
 And then I saved the Union, freed the slaves, yada, yada, you get it. 
 Okay, so your only real regret is that you never got to see the end of the play where this dude killed you? 
 It was the theatrical event of the season! 
 I waited months for those tickets. 
 And I would have seen the end, too, if it wasn't for that m*therf*cker John Wilkes Booth! 
 Woah. 
 I'm sorry, but he was a dick. 
 (knocking) 
 Hang on. 
 If that's the bellhop, no tip, he's been thirty minutes. 
 Here's the script you requested, Mr. Pacalioglu, though I don't see how it's... 
 Thanks! 
 What's that? 
 This is the script to your play, Our American Cousin. 
 You got the script? 
 Oh my God! 
 Oh my God! 
 You guys are gonna love it. 
 It's about this oafish American, see, who visits his prim and proper English cousins after he inherits their estates. 
 It is an absolute riot! 
 Ohh, that sounds great. 
 Let's get started. 
 So, Act 1, Scene 1. 
 An oafish American... 
 Ohhh, no, no no. 
 This is Our American Cousin! 
 One does not just read Our American Cousin! 
 It deserves to be performed on a real stage, with real actors, and not interrupted by gunshots. 
 Damn you, John Wilkes Booth! 
 Damn you to hell! 
 I imagine he's there, right? 
 Yeah, I'm sure he is. 
 Listen, the whole reason I'm in New York is for Broadway, so if we're going to do this, we're gonna do it right, which means we need to find a theater. 
 Can it be off-Broadway? 
 Sure. 
 Uh, hi! Excuse me, I would like to rent your theater. 
 Now, before you say no, let me just explain something to you: it's actually a show for ghosts. 
 500 bucks. 
 Oh! 
 Uh, ex-squeeze me? 
 This stage has seen it all. 
 For 500 bucks, you can beat off in every seat in the theater, for all I care. 
 Uh, one second. 
 500 bucks? That's like, all the money from the hotel job! 
 I don't wanna do that! 
 I love these sconces! 
 This place has a lot of character. 
 Abe, don't touch. 
 Kevin, it's Abraham Lincoln. 
 People are beating off in there and then we got to sit in them and... 
 You just had to manage a theater, didn't you? 
 Couldn't have been an engineer like Dad said, you big, dumb idiot. 
 Uh, yes. Okay, fine. 
 We'll take it. 
 Hi, my name is Nicole Schreiber, and I will be doing a scene from the motion picture Seven. 
 Uh, no we actually have material... 
 ... for you to read...

 No, what's in the box? 
 What's in the freakin' box?

 Hi. 
 You. 
 Do you know where Camomile is? 
 Why are you naked?

 I'm all alone.

 It's okay. 
 Everything's gonna... ahh! 
 Ohh, vomit!

 ♪ 
 So, uh, what... what happened to Camomile? 
 You know that, uh, whole Samantha Cherry story? 
 The girl that they took out of, uh, they took out of that bunker last week? 
 Yeah, I heard about it. 
I mean, uh, everybody knows about it, I... I didn't have anything to do with it, if that's what you're saying. 
 I mean, how could I? 
 I'm just a fat guy that falls down! 
 I'm just a fat guy that falls down! 
 Ask anybody! 
 Okay, well, anyway, when Cam heard that Samantha had been found, I mean, she totally, she freaked out. 
 Because you know, talking to Samantha Cherry's ghost essentially launched her career! 
 I know. 
 And, and she started talking about how she's been exposed, and it's like, it was... it was done for her as a medium! 
 It was over! 
 And then, and then, she, um, vanished? 
 And uh, I haven't heard from her for days. 
 Okay, all right, all right. 
 Hey hey hey, listen, listen, listen! 
 Listen, listen. 
 You need to take your mind off of this, okay, and I have just the thing. 
 Oh, no. I don't know. 
 If I do any more coke, I think my head will explode. 
 No, no. I'm not talking about coke, I'm talking about the best drug of all. 
 I'm talking about acting. 
 Remember that? 
 Yeah, there's that twinkle. 
 I'm putting on a show tonight. 
 It's an old-timey play, it's over three hours long. 
 It makes no sense whatsoever. 
 And you'd only have this afternoon to prepare. 
 Basically, it's... 
 The role of a lifetime! 
 Yes. 
 (glass shattering) 
 I'll do it. 
 Yes! 
 God, it is exactly how I imagined it. 
 Woah, woah. 
 Ay-o. 
 Matthew Biscotti, the greatest actor alive is here to save your play. 
 O-M-G! 
 I am freaking out right now. 
 Where is everybody? 
 Oh, uh yeah. 
 I, maybe I failed to mention this is a, uh, play for ghosts.

 Fantastic. 
 All right. 
 Is he drunk? 
 Uh, yes. 
 Very much so. 
 Can he pull this off? 
 I don't know, I guess we're about to find out, right? 
 Uh, Mr. Biscotti, would you mind terribly if we did a little rehearsal?
