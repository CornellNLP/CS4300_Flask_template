 Previously on Deadbeat... 
 Ghosts stick around when they have unfinished business. 
 I never got to have s*x. 
 I died a virgin. 
 So, what were you, like a dentist? 
 I was an avant-gardist. 
 You see me? 
 Is that your first or your last name? 
 What? 
 What? 
 Finishing unfinished business is my business.

 My guest today is celebrated paranormal communicator Camomile White. 
 (speaking gibberish) 
 Camomile White is a fraud.

 And when I get paid, I'm gonna come back for you. 
 I'm gonna rescue you from Camomile. 
 Ms. White, please, I believe in Kevin.

 Roofie, it's cute. 
 I see what it is, man. 
 Dude, so what the hell is your end game? 
 Uh... what do you mean? 
 You keepin' her on as a ghost on purpose? 
 Yeah. 
 Then what? 
 Well, I haven't really thought that far ahead, okay, Roofie? 
 But all I know is, I really like this girl, okay? 
 I like her a lot and for the first time in my life, it feels like maybe somehow a girl likes me back. 
 That's a big deal to me, okay? 
 Also, I asked her to live with me, so I need you to hold on to the finger. 
 Hell no. 
 Yes. 
 Hell no. 
 Just touch it. 
 This is what I'm talking about. 
 You can't build a relationship on lies. 
 Why not? 
 Because, you're terrible at lying. 
 No I'm not. 
 Now Sue believes she has some other unfinished business that you have to go on a wild goose chase to solve. 
 Great job. 
 A little credit, please. 
 I have it under control.

 Shoot. 
 It's useless. 
 I'm never gonna figure it out. 
 No, no, no, we will, we will. 
 Let's do something to take your mind off it. 
 There's a Felonies and Misdemeanors marathon on today. 
 Let's watch that together. 
 The noise complaint was called in at 10 p.m. but the party was clearly over at 9. 
 How's that possible? 
 It's not possible. 
 It's not even a crime. 
 Unless... Daylight savings. 
 Daylight savings, I knew it. 
 I was there with them. 
 That's a goddamn misdemeanor. 
 Ah, genius. 
 I heard they had to replace the two leads 'cause they wanted bigger trailers. 
 My ex used to love this show. 
 Your ex? 
 Not ex, just this guy who I saw a couple of times. 
 I thought it was gonna turn into something serious but then outta nowhere, he just ghosted me. 
 Ew, gross. Sue! 
 What? No. 
 He ghosted me, like he stopped responding to my calls and texts, vanished into thin air. 
 Oh, I thought... 
 I thought you meant when a guy stands over you and just completely covers your face with his... 
 Nothing. Never mind. 
 Wait, maybe that's my unfinished business. 
 Ew, gross. Sue! 
 What? No. Glen, the ex. 
 We were supposed to have a date by the river but then he never showed. 
 He never even called. 
 It really effed me up. 
 That's total B.S. 
 We gotta go find that guy. 
 Yeah, we should find him. 
 We should absolutely and you can finally confront him. 
 And figure out what I did wrong. 
 Yeah! No. What? 
 Does the color red mean anything to you?

 Thomas has completely forgiven you. 
 He has moved on and he is at peace now. 
 He is... (glass shattering) 
 What... my God. 
 Was that him? 
 No, that wasn't him. 
 That was the ghost of a former tenant or something. 
 A melon magnate who hates plates. 
 Not important. 
 All this is not important to us. 
 What is important is your husband, Thomas. 
 He is now completely at peace. 
 (glass shattering) 
 Thomas? 
 This definitely does not seem like he is at peace. 
 Please, Ms. White, do I need to stop banging his brother? 
 No! 
 This is... Cut! 
 This is not going to work. 
 What...

 Excuse me. 
 Oh, all right, bye, Zoila. 
 Bye, Mr. Glen. 
 I'll see you real soon, okay? 
 Yeah, sh1t, I had a whole thing. 
 Now I'm, like, totally thrown off.

 Please, just take your time. 
 Yeah, okay, thank you.

 "Can I help you?" 
 "No, I don't think you can help me 'cause you don't help anyone." 
 (mumbling) 
 Ah yes, right, right! 
 Because you enjoy hurting others for your own sick pleasure. 
 Don't you? 
 Oh, golly, no. 
 I'm a doctor. 
 A doctor! 
 So... you... exploiter people's illnesses and injuries for your own sick profit, don't you? 
 Oh, well, actually, I'm a volunteer. 
 Yeah, I come from a lot of money, so I usually just donate my salary back to the hospital.

 Sorry! 
 My leg was broken in two places. 
 Yeah, well, Sue's heart was broken in three places. 
 You could have at least called. 
 No, I couldn't! 
 Because my phone was broken in four places. 
 I lost all my contacts. 
 Especially Sue's. 
 Yeah, well, Sue doesn't buy that your phone wasn't backed up to your computer. 
 Yes, it was. 
 My laptop. 
 But I had to break it in half to use it as a splint.

 I had no idea where Sue lived. 
 I knew if I didn't reach her before she left that park, I'd lose her forever. 
 But I was too late. 
 No!

 There you go, the relationship literally ended by accident. 
 There's no reason for us to even be here anymore. 
 Wait, maybe there's a different reason why we're here. 
 Maybe Glen and I need to reconnect. 
 Sue... 
 Wait! 
 Maybe there is a reason you're here. 
 Maybe this is fate giving us a second chance.

 I bet. 
 Maybe we can finish that date we never had. 
 Maybe tomorrow. 
 Please? 
 Yeah. 
 Um, Sue would like to know if you are free tomorrow. 
 Oh, uh, that's tricky. 
 I'm actually getting married tomorrow. 
 Married! Ha! 
 Married?
