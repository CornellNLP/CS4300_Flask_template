 Oh, my God! 
 Oh, f*ck! 
 Sue, what are you doing out here? 
 It's okay, I didn't hear anything. 
 Don't say that, that means you definitely did hear something. 
 It's too late, it's all over me. 
 Am I visible? 
 I feel like it's sticking to me and making me visible. 
 Yeah, so we kinda took a step backwards there, but on the plus side, we both agree that it's best if she's never transparent around me again. 
 So, why don't you just tell her how you feel? 
 Oh, I don't know. 
 With words I'm not such a good, uh... you know, candidate? 
 You know what you should do, right? 
 You should take her on a fancy date, let your actions speak louder than your words. 
 Come on, man, that's the most expensive idea I've ever heard. I can barely afford food for myself right now! 
 How am I gonna pull off a fancy date? 
 How about you get a high paying job? 
 Oh, is that it? 
 Yeah. 
 And I suppose a high paying job is just gonna come walking right up to me? 
 You read "The Secret," it could happen. 
 Excuse me. I'm sorry. 
 Is one of you the guy who gets rid of ghosts? 
 Yeah, yeah, that would be me, but I'm kind of in the middle of something right now, so... 
 Oh, I can totally relate. 
 You see, I'm kind of in a bind. 
 Um, I'm reopening my restaurant, the Rusty Blowtorch, and the kitchen staff is convinced that the place is haunted. 
 That sucks. I'm really sorry to hear about your restaurant, but I need to figure out how I'm gonna be able to afford to take a girl I like on a fancy date to show her how I feel. 
 Such as... the Rusty Blowtorch. 
 Yes, Roofie, thank you. 
 Very good example. 
 Which he owns! 
 Oh. Yes! 
 Well, then sir, as the owner of a fancy restaurant, you should certainly be able to appreciate my situation. 
 He'll take the job. 
 Thanks. 
 What job? 
 Yeah, he'll take it. 
 Huh? 
 Thank you.

 The Rusty Blowtorch. That's a cool name. 
 I assume it refers to the s*x act? 
 I'm sorry. What s*x act? 
 Oh, you know, when a girl eats out a guy's ass and then reaches around and lights his dick on fire? 
 Standard. 
 Everything we serve here is cooked with a rusty blowtorch. 
 Got it. That makes... 
 So I'm gonna go pay my respects to the chef now. 
 Shall I come with? 
 No, no, no, no. You stay here. 
 Sometimes these ghosts, they can take their sweet time showing themselves. 
 (rattling in kitchen) 
 Sometimes not. 
 (laughter) 
 Good luck. 
 Duck? Duck? 
 Duck? There's no duck on my menu. 
 It's the poor man's swan! 
 Yet no matter where you look today, there's duck. Duck! Duck! 
 Oh! God! 
 You could have at least said duck! 
 You can see me? 
 Ow. 
 Yes, I can see you. My name is Pac. 
 I'm a medium. I'd shake your hand, but you're a ghost, and you know. 
 It's... 
 Yeah. 
 Anyway, your boss sent me in here to figure out why you're haunting his restaurant? 
 His restaurant? You know, he wouldn't even have a restaurant if it wasn't for me! 
 I get it, man. You want credit for the success of the restaurant, and the man ain't giving it to you. 
 What? No, no. 
 I don't need his recognition. 
 I've opened dozens of restaurants. 
 Woah. 
 Yeah. 
 I did James McAvoy's bachelor party. 
 I touched Padma Lakshmi's tit, and got kicked off "Top Chef" for it. 
 You touched her tit? Was it over the bra? 
 Over the shirt. 
 That's still... that's still good. I'd take that. 
 It was totally worth it, by the way. 
 It was very supple. 
 So... 
 What, uh, do you want then? 
 (sighs) 
 On the night of my death, a critic named Craig B... write it down... Craig B. published a negative review of my food. 
 It's the only negative review I've ever gotten. 
 It tore me up inside. 
 And outside. 
 I got so distracted, I accidentally put my hand through a meat grinder. 
 This one time, I got so stoned, I accidentally put on like 50 pounds. 
 I'm sorry. 
 No, that's okay. 
 Can you help me convince this guy to change his review? 
 Yeah, I can do that. 
 So what are we talking, are we talking New York Times, Village Voice? 
 No... 
 Yelp. 
 What's a Yelp? 
 Once we get online, we can use the locations of the businesses he reviews on Yelp to narrow the area where he lives. 
 Then we can use Instagram's GPS function to see if anyone with the same user ID is posting in that vicinity. 
 Chances are, if this guy's writing about food, he's also uploading photos of food. 
 Then we'll probably find a match and be able to pinpoint his exact building on a map. 
 Cool. 
 You're like Sanderson. 
 Who? 
 Sanderson, the tech guy from "Felonies and Misdemeanors"? 
 Never mind. 
 Sanderson would have known that already. 
 Well, I learned a lot of tricks working for... 
 Camomile White! 
 Out... outside your front door now. 
 Could you... could you open it for me please? 
 And then I won't have to soil my hand on this filthy thing. 
 What do you want? 
 Uh, I just wondered if I could speak to you for a moment. 
 Yeah. 
 Yeah, I guess so. Come in.

 I, uh, I know you're probably busy doing whatever it is that you do. 
 Mhm. 
 But I just wanted to give you these. 
 What? 
 I was cleaning out Sue's stuff the other day, and I... I thought you'd like them. 
 You must miss her terribly. 
 Actually, no I don't. 
 Now that she's a ghost, I see her more than ever before. 
 Sue's still around? 
 I had no idea. 
 Is... is she here now? 
 Can... can... can I talk to her? 
 (modem buzzing) 
 Yeah, sure. Go ahead. 
 Talk. 
 Sue? 
 If you can hear me, it's me. 
 Camomile. 
 I just wanted to say how much I miss you. 
 As a friend, not just an assistant. 
 Although I certainly do miss you as an assistant too. 
 Now I've got my own reality TV show, there's so much to do, and I don't know how I'm going to pull it off without you.

 Unless you're selling Girl Scout Cookies, I'm not interested. 
 No. No, I wish. 
 Closing the door now. 
 No. No, no, no, no! 
 I'm sorry. Uh, I'm sorry. 
 Are you Craig B., from Yelp? 
 Who wants to know? 
 Kevin P. 
 I'm not familiar with your work. 
 Oh. I'm a medium. 
 Craigory, close the door! 
 You're letting the heat out. 
 Shut your filthy mouth, Mother! 
 She's right. We should close this. 
 Yeah. Mother knows best, right?

 So... 
 Lovely. 
 Thank you. 
 What's that... what's that? 
 Is that a zebra skin rug? 
 It's white tiger. 
 And it's not for sale. 
 Can I help you? 
 Yes. Yeah. Uh, I am here because you wrote a review for the Rusty Blowtorch recently? 
 You gave it two out of five stars? 
 I remember it well. 
 The food was atrocious. 
 I gave it one star for decor and one because the weight of the fork was pleasing to the hand. 
 Yeah. Absolutely. 
 Well, see, the thing is, the chef who cooked the meal for you that night has since died. 
 Good. 
 Yeah, or, you know... bad. 
 But he's hanging out still as a ghost, and he won't leave until you give his food a second chance. 
 He believes if you have a better experience this time around, maybe you will... 
 I'll what? I'll change my review? 
 Yeah. 
 That's not gonna happen. 
 Do you know what that would do to my credibility on Yelp? 
 I have 17 followers. 
 I mean, come on, man. 
 It's a dead man's last wish! 
 I just told you. I don't change my reviews for any reason! 
 Certainly not my magnum opus. 
 Your magnum... what? 
 The food at that restaurant was so wretched it was actually inspiring. 
 The... the... the words flowed as freely from my fingertips as the diarrhea that flowed from my anus later that night. 
 Oh. 
 It was my finest review ever. 
 Now, if you'll excuse me... 
 No, let's just talk about the diarr... 
 No. We're done. 
 Okay, but just to review... 
 To review, this conversation gets one star, but only because I can't give it a zero. 
 Okay. Thanking you. 
 Harsh. 
 Goodbye. 
 One star? 
 Tough critic. 
 You want a hot dog? 
 Yes. 
 f*ck yeah. No, actually... 
 Wait, wait. Hold on, hold on. 
 Let me Yelp it first.

 No. 
 One hot dog please. 
 Appreciate it. 
 How is it? 
 Great. 
 Yeah? Yeah? 
 But the service sucked, right? 
 No. 
 Yeah, it seems like a really tiny hot dog for the amount of money you paid. 
 No, same great hot dog, same price, everywhere you get it. 
 Are you f*cking kidding me? 
 So you're telling me I missed out on a plump, juicy, moist-looking hot dog served with a smile? 
 Mhm. 
 Thank you very much, Debbie J. 
 Dude, it's Yelp, man, nobody even pays attention to what they write. 
 That's not true. 
 This Craigory B. Guy does. 
 Look, look what he wrote. 
 "Your ambiance is grand, but with what I'm in love is this fork which fits like a well-worn glove. 
 Heretofore have I felt such an agreeable weight. 
 I only wish I could eat it instead of the dreck on my plate." 
 That's poetic, right? 
 It's only poetic because it's a quatrain. 
 Let me see. 
 It's a what-train? 
 Look. 
 "Your ambiance" is misspelled, right? 
 It is? 
 It's a typo, yes. 
 It's "your." 
 It should be spelled Y-O-U-R. 
 Yeah, he's got Y-O-R-E. 
 Yeah. It's not even a common form of the common mistake. 
 Yeah.

 I'm sorry, can I borrow "your" iPad? 
 You're ridiculous.

 Everyone deserves a second review. 
 Fine. 
 Mhm? 
 Fine! 
 Okay, you don't have to yell.

 Really? 
 Yeah! 
 We're gonna... holy, okay, I'm gonna go to the farmer's market and I'm gonna get some, uh, white truffles are in season.

 You ever had a garlic confit? 
 Yeah, I love garlic confit. 
 Awesome.

 An hour? 
 Yeah. 
 I don't have enough time to... 
 I'm not gonna be able to roast an entire pig with a blowtorch in an hour, I need more... 
 I'm gonna have to improvise. 
 Who's going to be here in an hour? 
 Oh, just some guy who's gonna eat here so Chef Christopher can move on. 
 Who's making the food? 
 The kitchen staff is here prepping for tomorrow but none of them can cook. 
 No, no. It's okay. Chef Christopher is gonna cook it all himself.

 What? 
 Now that she has this new reality show I really feel like she needs someone around who she can trust. 
 Are you kidding me? 
 You're actually considering going back to work for Camomile. 
 I know it sounds crazy but when she was here earlier I really got the sense that she changed. 
 Who cares? 
 She can't even hear you or see you. 
 Which is why the only way I can be her assistant is if you be my assistant and translate for me.

 You will? 
 Yeah, I'll do it. 
 If that's what you want, I'll... 
 Yeah, I'll do it. 
 You don't seem too happy about it. 
 Well, it's just, if I really wanted to work for Camomile, I would have accepted her job offer a couple days ago. 
 Camomile already offered you a job? 
 I know, right. How awkward is this conversation going to be? 
 Doing what? 
 Working on her TV show thingy. 
 Oh, my God!

 Ask him what his favorite band is. 
 What? Why? 
 Just ask him! 
 All right, spaz. 
 Hey Craigory, what's your favorite band? 
 Um, Quarterback. 
 It's like a Nickelback tribute band, but the early stuff. 
 Okay, ask him his favorite movie. 
 Uh, what's your favorite movie? 
 Oh, Sharknado 2. 
 The first one, the sound was awful! 
 Of course! How could I have not seen it sooner?
