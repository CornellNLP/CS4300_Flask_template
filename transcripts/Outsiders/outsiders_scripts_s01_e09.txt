 With this oak, our new leader takes rule. 
 But if the oak be taken in a manner impure, so the new Bren'in shall not endure. 
 Shouldn't be no concern to you. 
 Well, I got no concern. 
 It don't make sense. 
 She took a bath. The water was still in the tub. 
 But her towel was sittin' where I left it, it was folded up, and it weren't damp. 
 If she didn't go, we'd all be gone. 
 G'win knows. 
 Will you be my queen, G'winveer? 
 I accept. 
 We've run into some bumps in the road. 
 By that, I mean the Farrells. 
 We know where they live. 
 Right up there on that mountain, keeping us from jobs. 
 Take 'em out to a bar. Buy 'em some drinks. 
 We gotta get them down off of there. 
 Hell, one of them tried to screw my sister. 
 Only idea I got is to go up there and kill 'em.

 I got somethin' for that back, and some Tequila.

 You ain't gonna win. Just throw it. 
 Ah! [Laughs] 
 [Speaks indistinctly] 
 You ain't got it. 
 You ain't... let's see. You ain't gonna get it. 
 Ah, ha ha! 
 Come on, give me a win.

 Come on. 
 You ain't got nothin'. 
 Oh! [Laughs] Yes! 
 You nicked! 
 Ain't nicked! 
 Shut yourself. 
 Ain't my fault they turned against ya. 
 You're a cheat. 
 Rather be a cheat than a whiny little bitch. 
 Now you're talking last night, huh? 
 Those are my winnings, not yours. 
 Try and keep up with me... 
 Guys! Open your eyes. 
 Whoa. I come in peace. 
 Make you all my sentry wards. 
 Y'all let a crazy man in here like he's a bug. 
 Get your ass inside. 
 That happens again... You won't like it. 
 [Speaks indistinctly] 
 ... My sentry wards? 
 Grow up. Do it now. 
 [Door creaks] 
 You like it? [Sighs] 
 Mm. 
 Well, it ain't much use to me without ammunition. 
 But maybe that's why you burned it all last night before giving it to me. 
 I was just trying to get your undivided attention, is all. 
 Well, come to think on it, there are a couple rounds left in it. 
 Mm? 
 [Hammer clicks] 
 Guess not. 
 You said you could get me a hundred more like this. 
 I can and I will. 
 See, the folks I'm dealin' with down there, they have an affection for Farrell wine. 
 Meaning you grant me more wine, and I can get you more fire. 
 We take what we want from them. 
 We don't Sully ourselves with their affairs or their money. 
 You know this. 
 What are you gonna do, cut off my hand? 
 Let him dirty himself. 
 You stay up here with us, protected. 
 I thought that guns made us weak, my queen. 
 You're the Bren'in. 
 Well... Well, then go dirty yourself, boy. 
 You heard my woman. 
 What I heard was "queen." 
 Queen? 
 Oh, that's right. 
 He wasn't there. No. 
 Well, I was never the marrying kind. 
 But I got to thinkin' that it ain't right that the the Bren'in not have a wife, so... 
 I offered, and she accepted. 
 Let's get back to our conversation. 
 You get me said fire for the coming war, you'll be good with me and this mountain for all time. 
 Fine. Done and done. 
 I mean, you're okay with that? You good? 
 Well, I sure am. Huh? How about you?

 Or worse, he runs back up top, brings down a bunch of crazies and kills us all! 
 I like to think that they would.

 No! Leave him alone!

 No, his phone's still going straight to voicemail. 
 You said he was headed into town? 
 Yeah, um, Caleb wandered off there a couple days ago. 
 Why would he leave his truck here? 
 You think maybe he found Caleb here, then went for a hike or somethin'? 
 In the middle of the night?

 Something about Asa Farrell's soul. 
 It's dark as burnt coal. 
 That why you like him? 
 What do you mean? 
 That what draws you in on him? 
 'Cause he got a devil inside him? 
 I'm drawn to what's strong and true. 
 Besides, Asa means nothing to me now.

 You shouldn't lie to your fiancé, you know. 
 Don't bode well for the relationship. 
 I believe that you think that you're done with him, but you aren't. 
 I can see it. Mm-hmm. 
 And my son can see it. 
 When that boy, when he left you... 
 He left you without a word.

 You're like a girl again, standing by a road, watching your heart disappear. 
 I'm gonna banish him for good, as soon as I get my guns. 
 I appreciate that.

 This time, don't banish him. 
 Kill him.

 Wade's been falling for such a long time, and... 
 I can't pretend that I'm completely surprised by this.

 W-what are you talking about? 
 Wade's wife. 
 Uh, they found her car abandoned on the night that she jumped off the bridge, and they never found her body. 
 Yeah, he and I have never discussed it. 
 But, I mean, there's rumors around town, but... 
 Andi-Rae was, uh, she was a sweet thing. 
 She was a ray of sunshine, till she wasn't.

 Look, it's all part of a larger plan, Krake. 
 I was standing there.

 He done that with  one  gun, and you wanna give him more? 
 It's lunacy.

 Giving guns to big Foster, obtaining 'em by trading away our nectar, our blessed wine, down there to  them? 
 How can I trust you, cousin? 
 You say you're lying to big Foster. 
 How I know you're not also lyin' to me? 
 You're right. We're truth tellers. 
 Always have been. 
 But, Krake, these times, exceptions are the rule. 
 Big Foster's gonna get those guns one way or the other.

 Come along with us. 
 I'm warning you. I ain't puttin' nothin' on. 
 Yeah, just these.

 [Conversations stop] 
 I'm here for one reason... my queen... she believes in our customs. 
 I respect her wishes. 
 Now let's get on with it and quick. 
 Rumors and stories are abounding. 
 We curious to know how it was you put hot metal into that boy's one good leg. 
 Craigin O'farrell? 
 I was asked to deliver a particular savory batch of wine to our Bren'in. 
 I was carrying my brew to his house, as instructed. 
 Outside of it, I seen these boys horsin' around... 
 Enoch and Griorgair and Phil'up. 
 When I crossed into the abode, our Bren'in got immediately upset at his sentry wards... them boys there. 
 [Sighs deeply] He rushed out with his gun, shot that man in the leg. 
 He have reason to do so? 
 That I cannot say. 
 Young man? 
 It was my fault entirely. 
 [Murmuring] 
 I was also witness to the event. 
 Yes, them boys were having themselves a benjo time. 
 Enoch here was laughin' and carryin' on, so he was the one that got shot. 
 Our former Bren'in, Lady Ray... she taught me that guns made a man weak, that they caused more blood to be spilled than prevented. 
 Our new Bren'in is right. 
 He knows that we have a war to fight now. 
 He knows that we need to pay attention, 'cause them lowland cowards... they could be upon us any moment. 
 So our days of laughin' and carryin' on... they're gone. 
 I say that with sadness, but I say it still. 
 Our Bren'in is our Bren'in, and his word is not just our law... 
 It's our truth.
