 Prophecy says one will save, and one will destroy. 
 Demon or king, Asa Farrell. Which be you? 
 My best son. 
 [Gunshot] Elon! Elon! 
 He be dead because of you. 
 And no matter what you do, you will never be one of us again. 
 They don't own that land they live on. 
 I just gotta wonder why we gotta play by the rules, and them Farrells don't. 
 We don't go up there. 
 They ain't supposed to come down here. 
 Caught one of 'em. 
 I swear, you'll never see me again. 
 Guaranteed i won't see you again.

 The bullet they found in him, same spec we recovered from the gun store robbery. 
 Is this what you were looking for? 
 This is Witches' Glove. Are you killing him, G'win? 
 [Retches, coughs] 
 [Laughing] 
 You lied to me. 
 You told me it was beautiful up here. 
 My family needs me. 
 We'll not sit by idly and let a false Bren'in crush us into dust. 
 We're gonna fight back. 
 You're up to somethin'. 
 But I can't figure it out. 
 I ain't up to nothin'. 
 Your time's come to an end. 
 You want me dead, old man? 
 Get ready to die.

 Uh... 
 No. 
 No, now that... 
 Now that Asa, he's gone for good, the Bren'in got to get to work. 
 I'd say you've been working hard enough as it is. 
 You should rest. 
 No time for that. 
 Where you going? 
 [Huffs] We got us rid of one infidel, but there's other caballers on this hill. 
 They're not doing us no harm. 
 They're doing the whole family harm. 
 Who? Shurn? Krake? 
 Foster, they just want what we all want. 
 You think they have some dark intentions? 
 Yeah, Krake especially. 
 A man with that kind of talent... 
 [Huffs] He's up to no good with it, I'll guarantee you. 
 Yeah, well, there's not much he can do from the box. 
 Why you arguin' with me?! 
 [Cupboard door closes] 
 He divided us. They all did. 
 And you saw it with your own eyes.

 I'm gonna fix it.

 Oh, can I play black and red? 
 Oh, my favorite game. 
 Hey! 
 Huh?

 We got backsliders all over this mountain, undermining us, and here you sons of bitches sit, playin' hearts, which is where I oughta shoot every last one of you right now!

 Let's go.

 Okay. Bye.

 Apparently they got... oh, boy, they got a big parade on this weekend and need, uh... they gotta have everybody watching their floats and, um... Baton twirlers and whatnot.

 Six?

 [Whispers indistinctly] ...End of the day. 
 Everybody, listen up! 
 Come on. 
 Cousin Asa Farrell's dead. 
 [Murmuring] 
 [Sighs deeply] 
 Krake's in chains. 
 Foster VI is coming for us with his men. 
 Now eventually, he's gonna find us. 
 Y'all know what's gonna happen to us once he does. 
 We gotta be ready. 
 Ready how? 
 We oughta move further down. 
 There's a place below the high falls... 
 No, look... right well hidden. 
 Look, it don't matter where we go. 
 Sooner or later, he's gonna find us. 
 And there's only one action we can take. 
 What might that be? 
 We gon' fight. 
 How? We got one weapon. 
 They got a dozen. 
 And he ain't never shot it before. 
 I shoulda said it before, but this one ain't got nothing. 
 [Clicks] 
 I tried firing it. See? 
 Don't matter. 
 We don't need that! 
 You see that? We don't need that! We got this! 
 Now when big Foster comes, and he's gonna come, y'all gonna distract him. 
 And that's when I'm-a go in and I'll slit his throat. 
 And he's done. 
 I'm with you, brother. 
 Me, too. 
 I'd rather die here than live the way we been livin'. 
 And my tice is dead, and I'd just as soon join him. 
 If you do succeed, they still shoot you dead. 
 I know. 
 [Thunder rumbling] 
 [Children shouting playfully] 
 He's a lovely boy. 
 Reminds me of my son at that age. 
 I didn't know you had a boy. 
 A lot you don't know about me, Sheriff. 
 What is this? 
 You gonna tell me my boy is cute, sit there and work the human angle? 
 At least now we can really talk to each other. 
 Yeah, why's that? 
 'Cause we're on the same side. 
 Believe it or not, that ain't never gonna be true. 
 Well, we want the same thing. 
 Close enough for government work, as they say. 
 You know two men are dead because of you? 
 I don't have any goddamn idea why you're doing this. 
 You won't succeed, going up there with six or eight or even a dozen men. 
 You're gonna need a lot more than that. 
 Yeah. Thanks for telling me. 
 I can get 'em for you. 
 The Governor's the one holding the reins on this thing. 
 He doesn't want the bad P.R. 
 But it's also true he can't win without our help. 
 So if you wanna do this right, you wanna go up there and find Breece's murderer, we're gonna have to work together. 
 You know, the more I think about it... 
 The more I think my sister is right. 
 Got no right blowing up that mountain.

 We're done. 
 Deal. 
 You'll get your men, and then i will get my mountain.

 Could I speak with him, please?

 I got an inklin' that you know where them traitors is hidin' at, don't you? 
 I don't. 
 Even if I did, i wouldn't be telling you. 
 Well, your demon friend Asa, he's dead and gone. 
 So you might want to think about changing your attitude there. 
 Whatever fool cogitation you're into, I don't care. 
 You won't get another word out of me. 
 Go ahead, kill me now! 
 [Inhales deeply] All right. 
 [Cocks gun] 
 No, no! Hey, hey, hey! 
 Don't do it! 
 Look, I know where they are. I can take you there. 
 Cousin Hasil. 
 I see you come to your senses. 
 [Sniffs] 
 It didn't work, did it? 
 [Door creaks] 
 The poison? 
 Just trying to keep him quiet, make him sick and slow and keep him in his bed until things got calm. 
 He killed that man. 
 He went after Krake. I had to do it. 
 Then I realized I can't. 
 I know you can't. 
 It's not in our hearts to kill each other, G'win. 
 What about you? 
 What about me? 
 I saw you shoot Asa dead. 
 Oh, that's different now, ain't it? 
 Why? 
 'Cause he ain't one of us. 
 Was not. 
 I heard that fa's off trying to find those troublemakers. 
 If he finds 'em, he's gonna kill 'em. 
 What do you plan on doing about that? 
 I don't rightly know. 
 If Asa was here, maybe he could've done it. 
 Not no more he can't. 
 So where is everybody? 
 Huh? 
 Gone to take a piss in the woods? 
 No, Bren'in. 
 We was waitin' for you.

 Phil'up! 
 You go on up, all right? Get the cousins, many as you can find, and bring 'em here. 
 All right? I want the world to see with their own eyes what the price of betrayal be! 
 Take your clothes off. 
 Take 'em off! 
 [Exhales deeply] 
 I wanna thank y'all for being here. 
 Our task is to detain and question our suspect. 
 His name's Asa Farrell. 
 This is him. Okay? 
 He spent a good amount of time off that mountain. 
 He's intelligent. He's educated. He's resourceful. 
 And he is a suspect in the multiple murders that we had here not long ago in Blackburg, and Arson. 
 We also believe he's implicated in the murder of Breece Dobbs. 
 We are not gonna be able to arrest this man with force alone. 
 Okay? We need to convince those people up there to work with us. 
 So what we're gonna do is we're gonna talk to 'em. 
 We're gonna go house to house... Hut to hut. Okay? 
 Whatever it is they live in. 
 Spaceship. 
 [Scattered laughter] 
 Okay, so expect them to be armed. 
 We're talkin' pistols, um, rifles. 
 I mean, you name it, they got their hands on it. 
 So stay on point, but do not threaten. 
 Do not initiate fire. 
 We're gonna go up there, we're gonna talk to 'em, we're gonna get our man, we're gonna get back down. 
 That's it. Get off that mountain. 
 Any questions? 
 How many of 'em you think there are? 
 Oh, we don't know. 
 Most we've ever seen together is four or five, so, uh, we anticipate there could be... 
 Mm, 50 to 80. 
 That's including women and children. 
 Roger that. 
 If they initiate fire... and I know some of y'all ain't gonna like this... do not return fire. Hold your position. 
 Stay tuned to channel 1.

 Poisonin' all of you and all of us.

 We are a family, a clan, or we are nothin'! 
 We don't stay together, them losties, they will  destroy us! 
 Now I come here to forgive all them, to heal this wound. 
 What'd they do? 
 They try to kill me.
