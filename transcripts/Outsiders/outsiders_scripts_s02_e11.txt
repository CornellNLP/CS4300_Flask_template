 - Previously on Outsiders... 
 - As you know, the coal company have poisoned our fields. 
 Those snakes intend to starve us off the mountain. 
 - So I think we get one of 'em up here. 
 - (Haylie screaming) 
 G'WIN: You must be thirsty. 
 Wait! 
 Hey, you promised she'd drink the water. 
 If she knew about the water, she would not have raised the jar to her lips. 
 HAYLIE: Could I have my phone? 
 There's no way it's gonna work up here, I just would like to take a picture. 
 - You know who that is? 
 - LIL FOSTER: I've seen him - that day that he was shot, yeah. 
 - Shot by who? 
 Foster Farrell VI. 
 Man who was killed, Breece Dobbs, he was my brother-in-law. 
 I need to know the whereabouts of the man who killed him. 
 He's a big man. 
 Long white hair. 
 That's one of the coal devils. 
 She needs to drink the water that killed Silas! 
 G'WIN: This was our best spring, poisoned. 
 Who did this? 
 Your coal company. 
 I promise I won't sell anything, but you got to pay for half the lookouts. 
 Come on, we got a deal? 
 Well, all right. 
 Miss? 
 You all right? 
 ♪    You're welcome. 
 MEYERS: We just got to be ready is all I'm saying, right? 
 So I don't want to get caught flat-footed. 
 That's gonna be good for no... 
 HAYLIE: You, get out. 
 Hang up the phone. 
 Holy sh1t. 
 Uh... 
 yeah. 
 I-I got to jump, Frank. 
 I'll call you later. 
 Where have you been? 
 What the hell happened to you? 
 Let's not talk about me, Matt. 
 - Let's talk about you. 
 - Are you okay? 
 You know, to be honest with you, I never really thought much of you; just some mid-level management forehead in a suit. 
 But I underestimated you. 
 This whole time I'm thinking you're nobody, and you're a full-blown murdering sociopath. 
 Okay, I don't know what happened to you, but clearly you're... 
 I know what you did, Matt. 
 What's that? 
 The end of your career. 
 (country blues music playing) 
 ♪ The dawn is up, there's fire on the mountain ♪  
 ♪ They'll have to answer for their crooked claim ♪  
 ♪ The hollows they'll surround them ♪   
 ♪ And they'll go running back    
 ♪ To the wretched realm they came ♪  
 ♪ Nor will the dogs of hell refrain ♪  
 ♪ And the land    
 ♪ Will suffer those who came. 
 You're kind of talking in riddles, so I'm not really following you. 
 HAYLIE: You know what? 
 That stupid fence. 
 Now I understand what it was really about. 
 You weren't trying to keep the Farrells in, you were trying to keep everybody else out, so they wouldn't find out what you're doing up there. 
 And what am I doing? 
 You're killing them, Matt. 
 You poisoned their water - and their crops. 
 - Who told you that? 
 Nobody told me, I know. 
 You murdered one of their children, Matt. 
 You were up there? 
 Is that where you went? 
 - That is not important. 
 - No, it is important to me. 
 And it might be important to One Planet. 
 I'm sure Don Foushee would be very interested to know that his star employee snuck off and got chummy with the people we're trying to fight against. 
 Are you threatening me, Matt? 
 I don't know what to think, honey, okay? 
 First it was the e-mail leak... 
 HAYLIE: You know I had nothing to do with that. 
 Oh, just admit that you did it. 
 Admit it. 
 And while you're at it, if you're so eager to call Don, you go right ahead, and you tell him you're gonna be stepping down. 
 I'm confused. 
 Admit what? 
 Okay. 
 Okay. 
 So here's what's gonna happen now. 
 I'm call some labs, I'm gonna get the samples tested, and when those results come back, I'm gonna share that with Don. 
 And the state's attorney's office. 
 And pretty much anybody else who will listen. 
 At which point, Matt, you're gonna be going to jail. 
  So you have a nice day. 
  Ms. 
 Grimes? 
  Sheriff, nice seeing you. 
  Hold up. 
  You want to come into my office, tell me where you been? 
  I actually really need to get to my hotel. 
  I understand that, it's just, you know, we have an active missing persons investigation. 
  Well, I'm not missing anymore, so... 
  I can see that... 
 doesn't mean we just close the books. 
  I'm need to ask you some questions. 
  Sheriff, as I'm sure you can tell using your lawman's powers of investigation, I'm in fairly desperate need of a shower. 
  You go for a walk in the woods? 
  Yeah, I did. 
 I went for a walk. 
  Uh-huh. 
 Alone? 
  Yes. 
 I got lost, and I found my way back. 
  Not a terribly gripping story, but there you have it. 
  The urge to walk must've been pretty strong considering you left your car unlocked, your purse inside, you know. 
  - We have that here. 
 - I need to get that from you. 
  You can have it when you talk to me. 
  What's in your jars? 
  Nothing. 
 Souvenirs. 
  - From my walk. 
 - Can I see? 
  Sheriff, I really need to get to my hotel. 
  And I'm gonna take a shower, and at some point very soon, I promise, I'm gonna come back here and we will have a chat, and I will gather my personal belongings. 
  I want you back here before   :   noon. 
  Oh, I can't wait. 
  Haylie. 
  You okay? 
  I've actually never felt better in my life. 
  SHURN: Water's running frightful low. 
  That group back from Shady Pond yet? 
  First thing daybreak, but what they brung already been sopped up. 
  KRAKE: Cistern's spitting more air than water, Bren'in. 
  What we gonna do? 
  "What are we gonna do?"     Like she even knows. 
  WOMAN: That's it. 
  She's gone dry. 
  - (all clamoring) 
 - What you talking about? 
  - Water's gone. 
 - How much did you take? 
  I took enough for me and my family. 
 -You and your family? 
  They all got families! 
  We're all trying to survive up here... 
  I got my childr... 
  ...and you're taking more than everybody else! 
  (clamoring continues) 
  We all need this water! 
  (shouting) 
  They all need water! 
 We all need it! 
  (clamoring continues) 
  MEYERS: No, of course you don't, because you weren't here. 
  No, that... but I'm not questioning that, okay? 
  No, you... 
  Right, it's... 
  Yeah, uh, I got to go, Don. 
  Okay. 
  - Yeah? 
 - Hey, can I talk to you for a minute? 
  I mean, I know you're busy. 
  Yeah, sure. 
  - Okay. 
 - Yeah. 
  I just, uh, I was just talking to Haylie Grimes. 
  Yeah, she's back. 
  Is that... what a relief. 
  Well, I'm surprised to hear you say that, considering she, you know, she was just in here sort of tearing you a new one, right? 
  - Yeah, what was that about? 
 - I... 
 I wish I knew. 
  I mean, I'm-I'm actually worried about her, Sheriff. 
  I mean, I don't know if it's the pressure of the job - or her failure... 
 - She seemed pretty normal to me. 
  You know, just... 
 she seemed fine, you know. 
  Pretty-pretty pissy and bossy, you know? 
 - (chuckles) 
  - Yeah. 
 - Yeah, yeah. 
  Where... 
 did she say where she went? 
  - No. 
 - No. 
 You ask her? 
  Of course I did. 
  What... 
 she say what was in those two little jars she had? 
  I don't know. 
 Alcohol? 
  I mean, that would explain a lot. 
  I just got a call in to Don Foushee. 
  - And, like, hopefully we can get her some help. 
 - Don Foushee? 
  Yeah, I mean, and I'm serious, Sheriff. 
  I-I think she can do harm to herself. 
  You know, why she come barging in here so urgent, you know? 
  - Know why that was? 
 - Who the hell knows? 
  She was raving, and... 
 none of it made sense. 
  I-I just... 
  I mean, did she say anything to you about-about what she said to me? 
  No. 
  - I'll should ask her. 
 I'll ask her. 
 - Yeah. 
  Next time I talk to her, I'll ask her. 
  You know, what she was talking about. 
  - Yeah. 
 - Yeah. 
  - I'll let you get to it. 
 - Thank you. 
  You hungry? 
 You want something to eat? 
  No, I'm good, thank you. 
  - Something to drink, a coffee? 
 - No, thanks. 
  G'WIN: I don't understand. 
  Grain store was near half-full not two days ago. 
  Suppose they're taking more than they need and hiding it away, for fear of bleak times to come. 
  War spreads like a fever. 
  First the folks below against us. 
  Now us against our own kin. 
  (sighs) 
  I do have an idea. 
  One that could solve both our problems all at the same time. 
  Pray tell. 
  I'm sorry, Bren'in, maybe I'm not comprehending proper - what you just said. 
 - All respect, but I'm thinking some of your husband's crazy - done rubbed off on you. 
 - Whoa, hey, watch yourself. 
  G'WIN: We're going on this run. 
  They poisoned our water and they ruined our crops. 
  We're only gonna take back what's owed us. 
  Water and flour, that's all. 
  Now, what we take, it's important, but what we leave behind, that could be even more important. 
  What's that? 
  Our story. 
  You think any of them folks down there will actually care to hear it? 
  It's not just hearing, Krake, it's seeing. 
  See, like that coal woman, most of those folks down there, they got phones, and those phones take pictures. 
  Now, if they show those pictures to people they know, and those people do the same, well, soon, our struggle's gonna be known - far, wide and strong. 
 - BIG FOSTER: No, our trouble's gonna be getting back up alive, you ask me. 
  That's right. 
  We're gonna walk into a nest of hornets down there. 
  And the law will have no end of fire. 
  And them guards at the fence, they ain't gonna just let us stroll on down. 
  Now, you ain't gonna agree, but we need to be armed. 
  Oh, I do agree. 
  But a weapon shown is much more effective than a weapon used. 
  - That's right. 
 - So if there is gunfire, it ain't gonna be our side firing first. 
  Oh, I understand. 
  And you make sure that all our people, they understand the same. 
  'Cause we are trying to tell our story here, and one bullet could undo the whole thing. 
  - That's right. 
 - WILLEM: Fire or no, we show ourselves down there and the police are gonna be on us thick. 
  Not if they're distracted. 
  By what? 
  By me. 
  (Hasil sighs) 
  What? 
  We need to talk. 
  Just-just give me a minute. 
  (both chuckle) 
  Get out of here. 
  Fight last night wore me out. 
  That's what we need to talk about. 
  I was the counting the money from the fight last night, and something ain't right. 
  How do you mean? 
  How much you make from your last fight, two nights ago? 
  About... 
 oh... 
  hair over $ ,   . 
  If I recall correctly. 
  Mm-hmm. 
  Fight from last night, you made less than $   . 
  So somebody's keeping some on the side, but it ain't you. 
  (clicks tongue) 
 Who do you think? 
  Look, you two got to be careful here. 
  Real careful. 
  'Cause this is starting to sound like an accusation. 
  Oh, it's not starting to sound like an accusation, Butch. 
  It is one. 
 You've been shorting us. 
  Definitely these last couple of fights, and maybe even longer than that. 
  Where's this coming from? 
  Is this both of y'all - or just her? 
 - Ugh, just be honest with us, Butch. 
  Can you believe this? 
  Don't look at me. 
  Look, he's getting less money for a very simple reason. 
  SALLY-ANN: Yeah? 
 What's that? 
  We had to hire - more of them lookouts, remember? 
 - Mm-hmm. 
  SALLY-ANN: How much you paying them? 
  $   each. 
  Mm-hmm. 
 Still doesn't explain the discrepancy. 
  Well, there's the food. 
  Remember that time I got food? 
  Talking about? 
 What food? 
  The donuts! 
  You bought four and then you ate three of them. 
  (sighs) 
  All right, look. 
  I admit, the split hasn't been proper the last couple fights. 
  I'm sorry. 
  We really need the extra money. 
  I mean, Frida with her transition, and the hormones and everything. 
  My girl's got a dream. 
  I just want to make it real for her. 
  Good Lord, even I call bullshit on that. 
  Just give them what you owe them. 
  Goddamn man-child. 
  All right, fine. 
  I don't know what it should be, but it's probably... 
  Oh, no, no, no. 
 I'll figure it out. 
  And I'll bring back what you're owed, if anything. 
  But from now on, we're done, Butch. 
  I'm representing Hasil now. 
  And he's gonna get every bit of what he's owed. 
  Come on, baby. 
  H-Hey, now. 
 Wait a minute. 
 Just hold up... 
  Shut your mouth, Butch. 
  You know, I thought you were my friend. 
  - I... 
 - Mm-mm. 
  Ma'am. 
  (door closes) 
  Pathetic. 
  Our water and our soil have been poisoned by the coal company. 
  One of our children has already died because of... 
  (knocking on door) 
  - Come. 
 - (door opens) 
  You called for me? 
  You choose your men for the run yet? 
  All set. 
  Is Lil Foster among them? 
  Mm. 
 Ain't no sign of him. 
  Hmm. 
 You want him keeping an eye on me down there? 
  Is that why you're asking? 
  Or is that why you're going? 
  - I'm going 'cause it's my duty. 
 - Oh, well, then to hell with your duty, you ain't going. 
  - I won't allow it. 
 - You won't allow it? 
  No. 
  Foster, you don't have that kind of power over me. 
  Well, I'm just trying to protect you. 
  I'm not gonna make a dangerous plan and then send others to do it. 
  I am trying to be a right leader here, Foster. 
  But what if something happens to you? 
  I ain't got no concerns for myself. 
  Oh? 
 Well, what about that child you're carrying? 
  You got any concerns there? 
  That's gonna be our child. 
  No, I told you that this child... 
  Oh, I know, I know! 
  I know it ain't mine! 
  All right, I got it burned in my skull just fine the first time you said it. 
  I told you. 
  I will be father to that baby. 
  I'm gonna... 
 I'm gonna give it everything that I never got. 
  I'm gonna get it everything I couldn't give to my boys. 
  I'll get it everything that you couldn't give to your first child died a-borning. 
  My baby is not a means for you to right your past wrongs. 
  This child, it will be good, it will be pure, and I will not be expose it to your darkness - and your anger. 
 - No. 
 I got no darkness. 
  You just showed it, not two breaths ago! 
  I will never forget the fear that you planted in me. 
  And I will not let that fear touch an innocent creature that I bring into this world. 
  I will never, I will never let you near this child. 
  Not ever. 
  Go. 
  Go! 
  (door opens) 
  (door closes) 
  (knocks) 
  (sighs) 
  - Hi. 
 - Hi. 
  This is a nice surprise. 
  Yeah. 
 Just thought I'd come by, say hello. 
  I don't want to disturb your dad, though. 
 How's he doing? 
  Oh, he's, um... 
  He went to hospital last night. 
 He has pneumonia. 
 So... 
  - Oh, no. 
 He's all right? 
 - He's gonna be there - for a couple days at least. 
 - Okay. 
  - Yeah. 
 - Well, they'll take good care of him there. 
  Sorry to hear that. 
  - You want to come in? 
 - No, I... 
  I can't, I have to... 
 I have to keep working, but, um... 
  I just wanted to stop by and see if you're good. 
  - Uh... 
 - Everything's good. 
  That's good. 
 Just 'cause, you know, I haven't spoken to you since I saw you last, and, uh, just asking if it was okay. 
  Are you, are you really asking me that? 
 (chuckles) 
  I'm... 
 no, I mean, like, I haven't done this in a while, so I just, I don't know if people do it d-differently now. 
  You mean, like, different techniques? 
  Yeah. 
  No. 
 What do you...? 
  I'm not talking about that. 
  (laughs): Wade, stop. 
  Oh. 
 Yeah, okay. 
  Hey. 
  It was really lovely. 
  Oh. 
 Well, I'm glad. 
  I'm not sure that lovely is what I was going for, precisely, but, uh... 
  Well... 
  - why don't you come in? 
 - Oh, no. 
  I mean, I have to go back and keep working. 
 Yeah. 
  But, Sheriff, I'm in this big old house all by myself and I'm afraid. 
  There's some really big noises in my bedroom. 
  Do you think you could maybe come look at it for me? 
  Like official sheriff's business? 
  Yeah. 
 Official sheriff's business. 
  It won't take a moment. 
  Okay. 
 (chuckles) 
  (giggles) 
  LIL FOSTER: Can't be Asa's. 
  Or Fa's. 
  I figured on the days, G'Win. 
  Glad all that drinking and screwing hasn't crippled your ability to count. 
  Look, I'm sorry. 
  For what? 
  This child's in my belly, not yours. 
  I got a clan to save. 
  Listen, I heard tell of this run, this story that you think you're gonna pass off onto these people down there; it will not work. 
  They're not like us. 
  That world is black as poison... 
 I know. 
  I went through fire in their prison box, G'Win. 
  Well, we've all been through fire, Foster. 
  All of us. 
 We've all been burnt up and scarred and twisted, so stop feeling so damn original. 
  And tomorrow, I'm going down this mountain, surrounded by my family. 
  Men, women, even children. 
  But where are you gonna be? 
 Hmm?

  ♪     Good day to you all. 
  We're Farrells. 
  We're not here out of disrespect or-or to take part in lawlessness. 
  We're-We're here out of need. 
  You see, our water and our soil, they've been poisoned by the coal company. 
  And two members of our family have already perished because of this, - one of them was a small child. 
 - (crowd mutters) 
  He was innocent. 
  The coal company, they're trying to starve us from our home, and we need your help to stop them. 
  (car horn honks) 
  Get out of the damn road. 
  - They're not hurting anybody. 
 - (crowd mutters) 
  Turn around. 
  That's right. 
 We're-We're not here to hurt anybody. 
  - (crowd muttering) 
 - Okay? 
 Just, please,     just look upon us as we are. 
  - (siren wailing) 
 - W-W-We're mothers. 
  We're fathers. 
 We're-We're sons and daughters. 
  - We're just like you. 
 We hurt. 
 - (sirens approaching) 
  We bleed, we love. 
  And we need your help, please. 
  If you don't get out of the road, I'll help you by running your hillbilly asses over! 
  (crowd shouting) 
  Shut your mouth.

  All units, stand down. 
 Do not engage until I get there. 
  Stand down and do not engage. 
 That is an order.

  MAN: Nobody wants them here. 
  Okay, listen, you need to go home. 
  All's we want is to be heard. 
  I understand that, but, you know, this is the middle of a public thoroughfare. 
  - You can't be...

 - I understand that, but it's... 
  Your water and your soil? 
  They dropped poison from the air above onto our fields and our springs.

  There's something wrong with you, you know that? 
  At lease I got something for nothing. 
  - What's in that bottle?

  Give up, assholes! 
 I got you. 
  No more running wild in my town, Farrells. 
  - Too late, Sheriff.

 You out of ammo? 
  BARON: Yeah, I figured that'd happen sooner than later, you dumbshits. 
  Well, now I'm coming for you. 
  Well, you keep on coming. 
 Come on! 
 -Come on! 
  BARNABIS: All right, now come on out and get it. 
  You make your move, come on!

  Wait a minute. 
 Wait, wait.

  Hey, take what you got. 
 Get your boys out of here. 
  Come on, go. 
 Go, go, go, go! 
  (sirens approaching) 
  (siren wailing) 
  (laughs) 
  Put your goddamn hands in front of you right now where I can see 'em! 
  Do it! 
 Hands out in front of you! 
  Breece Dobbs, my brother-in-law. 
  You're the one killed him. 
  Stay down, I said. 
 You move one muscle, I'm gonna shoot you in the head right now. 
  You ain't taking me, like you took my boy, to some jail. 
  You want me? 
  You going to take me dead. 
  Foster Farrell VI, you're under arrest for the murder of Breece Dobbs. 
  You have the right to remain silent. 
  - Anything you say or do... 
 - You want to shoot me? 
  - ...in a court of law. 
 - Go ahead and shoot me. 
  Go on, do it. 
 Do it, you sh1t coward! 
  - You sh1t coward! 
 - You sh1t coward! 
  You hide yourself up on a goddamn mountain. 
  That's a goddamn coward! 
  (motorcycle approaching) 
  Drop the gun, Wade. 
  Yeah, I don't think that's too likely right now. 
  If you don't, I'm surely gonna use mine. 
  You know, I was the one that helped you. 
  I'm the one that set you free. 
  That's why I ain't shot you yet. 
  This man's a goddamn murderer. 
  Murdering pig coward snake killed my brother-in-law. 
  Come on, Fa. 
  Leave it, let's go. 
  Come on, old man. 
  You move one inch, I'm gonna shoot you in your goddamn face. 
  Go ahead and do it. 
  I've wanted him dead my whole life. 
  See? 
 I'm sorry to say he means it. 
  Why don't you people just stay up there? 
  Just leave us in peace. 
 That's all people want. 
  They just want peace. 
  Want to wake up on the morning and take their kids to school, go to work... 
 not have to find their kin dead, splayed out like a dog in the middle of the road. 
  When's this gonna end? 
  When we get to live the same way. 
  I'm walking away now, Sheriff. 
  You turn your back on me, I'm gonna shoot you in the back of your head. 
  (gunshot) 
  Goddamn coward! 
  We're here out of need. 
  You see, our water and our soil, they've been poisoned. 
  (sighs) 
  - Hey. 
 - Hey. 
  REPORTER (on TV): ...throughout the downtown area. 
  As they charted their protest through the streets... 
  You must have had a day. 
  Yeah. 
  Would you turn that off? 
  What is it? 
  I saw him today. 
  The man who killed Breece. 
  I had my gun a half foot from his chest. 
  Could have shot him dead right there. 
  But you didn't. 
  He's a Farrell. 
  You know this thing, this mess between us? 
  It's not gonna get any better. 
  It's just gonna keep going and going and going. 
  Maybe someone else can do something about it, but, uh, not me. 
  I'm not strong enough. 
  - Yes, you are. 
 - No. 
  Wade, you're strong enough not to do the wrong thing when it's half a foot in front of you. 
  (phone ringing) 
  Yeah? 
  Yeah. 
  Yeah. 
 Yeah, I'll be right there. 
  Wade. 
 Wade, what is it, w... 
  - Wade. 
 - (door shuts) 
  (tires screech) 
  (elevator bell dings)
