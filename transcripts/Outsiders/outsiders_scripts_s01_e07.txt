 Previously on "Outsiders"... 
 Should I call the police? 
 No, they're useless. The new Sheriff's an oxy freak. 
 I can't do this anymore. 
 And you get some help, or I'm taking that boy away from you. 
 The Bren'in's woke up. 
 Well, what a glorious day. 
 I know what you did. 
 And the only reason your heart is still beatin' is you're my son. 
 Don't ever leave me alone with him again. 
 Big Foster is going after guns. 
 This here... this is the path to salvation. 
 For 200 years, this mountain's been enough. 
 And bringing guns up here, it's... it's an insult to her power. 
 Can you just help me protect her, please? 
 Get out of here! 
 We're all gonna die out here! 
 Shoo! 
 Shoo! Get! 
 Get out! 
 Go! Shoo! 
 Shoo! 
 Hey, where my boy? 
 We scattered. He'll be along present. 
 Where's Tice? 
 Oh, I'm sure he's fine. 
 How you think them sumbitches knew to be waitin' for us? 
 I don't know, fa. 
 No? 
 No. W-what are you saying? 
 Well... somebody must've sent word. 
 Well, I don't know how it got down there. 
 Yeah. 
 Went down earlier today. 
 Obvious didn't go right. 
 When do things ever go right down there? 
 Rumor has it he tried to steal some fire. 
 Uh-huh. 
 Plan combusted, so to speak. 
 He doesn't learn too fast, does he? 
 Nope. 
 Where you goin'? 
 You should be down there looking for my boy. 
 What happened, Shurn? 
 Hey. You stay out of this. 
 He's fine. 
 I'll tell you what happened. 
 Tice went down with them this mornin' to do his mischief. 
 He ain't come back. 
 Yeah, well, maybe he want a spell away from your naggin' ass. 
 What were you doin' down there? 
 You better tell me now, son. 
 Be worse if somebody else has to. 
 It's my duty to protect us. 
 You thefted some more guns. Am I right? 
 So let's see 'em. 
 Well, we went after them, but we changed our mind. 
 You're not wise enough for that. 
 Yes, ma'am. You may be right. 
 And if all you did down there was change your mind, where's her boy? 
 Uh, well, uh, Tice, he never gone on a run before. 
 Maybe... i don't know. Maybe he's lost. 
 Or maybe he went to see a movie. Huh? 
 Damn it. 
 He ain't lost. 
 I seen him. 
 The law was all around. Red lights. 
 They put him in a bag. They... they took him away. 
 Tice... 
 He ain't lost. He's... he's dead. 
 No. 
 No! 
 Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! 
 Let me go! 
 Shurn, just... 
 Let me go! 
 Shurn... 
 I'm-a cut you! 
 Shurn, Shurn, Shurn, look at me. Look at me. 
 Look, I-I protected him. Okay? 
 I protected him. 
 And they set on us, they fired at us, like an army! 
 Okay, I saved him. 
 Now he was with us well and good when we left. 
 If something happened to him, it was on account of his own doin'. 
 Everything you do just digs us deeper. 
 How's that boy supposed to be buried up here now? 
 Well, I'll go back down there and I'll fetch his body. 
 Only place you're goin' is to chains. 
 Fetch the chains! 
 Now look, come on! You don't mean that. 
 Now you going willingly or not? 
 Well, I can't bring the boy back up if I'm up here, can I? 
 Too late. 
 They already took his body. 
 Now are you going to your punishment, or do I have to order these boys to take ya? 
 Well, I am sorry. I am sorry that the boy got hurt. 
 But you got no idea the threat that they pose! 
 You ain't been down there in 40 years! 
 Take him away! 
 No, no, no, no. 
 Okay, wait a minute. Listen to me. Listen to me! 
 All of you, listen to me! 
 'Cause we follow her to our graves! 
 All right? To our graves! 
 Take him to the box! Do it now! 
 Hey! Hey! Back off! 
 Do it now! 
 You back off! 
 Don't make it worse on yourself. 
 You're turning against me, too? 
 Don't make it worse... 
 You're turning... 
 Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! 
 What did you do? 
 Come on. Like you don't know. 
 I did what you asked me to do... Stop 'em. 
 You should be thankin' me. 
 Bhradain and Enoch told Shurn they were set up. 
 I made one call to the gun shop, G'win. 
 One phone call, that's it. 
 Did you want people to get hurt? 
 No, I did what you asked me to do. 
 Does Foster have guns? Does he? 
 Tice is dead. 
 I know. I'm sorry. 
 Okay, maybe I thought big Foster would be the one that ended up getting killed. 
 I mean, I don't know. 
 Aw, sh1t! I don't know. 
 Where you goin'? 
 If the law found the body like Hasil said, it means the police are keeping him in the morgue. 
 It's a place where the police keep unclaimed bodies. 
 Y-you're... you're gonna talk to the police? 
 He needs to be buried on the mountain, G'win. 
 If I don't bring his body back, his spirit will Hunt me down for the rest of my life, and I can't have that. 
 Hunt us down. 
 Both of us. 
 Wade? 
 Wade. 
 Wade. 
 Huh? 
 Back door was unlocked. 
 I've been calling all day. 
 I think I, uh, I must've had my ringer off. 
 You okay? 
 Yeah. 
 Yeah. I think I'm coming down with somethin'. 
 Um... 
 We're looking into a hit-and-run off katz road. 
 We're thinking it might be one of them Farrells. 
 One of them, uh, hit somebody? 
 N-no. Uh, one of them got hit. 
 I deserve to be here. 
 I... I know that now. 
 I was only trying to do right by us. 
 I learned my lesson. 
 You gotta believe me. 
 You don't get to tell me what I gotta believe, you waste of flesh. 
 The only thing I'm obliged to do is make sure you do no more harm to this family. 
 You didn't know I had this, did you? 
 I had to protect myself against your fa, didn't I? 
 He died by his fire, and so will you. 
 All right. All right. You're right, Ma. 
 All right, I deserve to perish. I do. All right? 
 But just let me try and make things right. 
 You call a circle. All right? 
 And let them punish me the way they see fit. 
 Ohh. So now you wanna do it by the law of the clan? 
 Trust me, circle be harsher than a hundred of me. 
 Cut your fingers off, like you did Hasil's, one by one. 
 Let you starve in here. 
 Oh, no. A bullet in your chest, and you bleed to death slow. 
 That'd be more fittin'. 
 No Farrell ever killed another. 
 I ain't gonna be the one to change that. 
 One of these days, somebody's gonna end that tradition. 
 I only hope they be doing it to you. 
 You know, if this kid's a Farrell, and he was down here yesterday, means he's probably linked to the attempted robbery, right? 
 It's possible, if he's a Farrell. 
 But we don't know that. Jesus. 
 Hey, you okay? 
 Yeah. I just haven't eaten. 
 Protein? 
 God, no, man. Put that away. 
 Organize an autopsy before we do anything. 
 All right. 
 Hey. Hey. 
 I think I got one... 
 Miss? Hey. Hey, I'm talking to you. Uh... 
 Sheriff, honestly, I need... 
 Listen. 
 I just need you for somethin', okay? 
 You're gonna come with me. 
 I ain't gonna bust ya, all right? 
 I just need you for something. Okay? 
 W-w-why? Why? Where we goin'? 
 I'll tell you on the way. 
 On the way where?! Sh... 
 I'm counting on you. You know that? 
 How's Norwood? 
 My Grandpa's name was Norwood. 
 Norwood's fine. 
 What was he wearin' again? 
 I got this. 
 Said his name was Norwood. 
 Kinda like this hippie kinda kid out from back east... You know, Raleigh County? 
 He... he had on a green... green shirt, I think. 
 What kind of car he have? 
 Oh, he... we was on foot. 
 Then where'd you do it? 
 In a parking lot. 
 Uh, more like a filling station, you know. 
 Um, it was out by 60, near the border. 
 It was all covered in crabgrass. He was real nice. 
 Then what? 
 Well, then he was walkin' away, and these three guys come in a shitty white van, and they... they kicked his ass and then they threw him in the van and then they... they... they drove off. 
 Why'd you wait to come in? 
 Well, like I'm clamoring to come down here and tell you guys anything. 
 Oh! And he had a... he had a necklace thingadoodle on him. 
 You know, that his old girlfriend made him? 
 Made out of weeds or somethin'. 
 All righty. Thank you, ma'am. 
 Mm-hmm. 
 Just got a call from Raleigh County, West Virginia. 
 State claimed the body. So, uh, we called the E.M.S. 
 They're gonna transport it up to Charleston, uh, right now. 
 Well, you have 'em check the DMVs, uh, on the white van. 
 And, uh, we'll see if anything pops. 
 Okay. 
 Rock star over here. 
 Shut up. 
 All right, here we are. 
 You got everything? 
 Yep. Thanks for the ride. 
 Hey. Uh, thank you again. 
 Yep. 
 Hey, one more thing I might ask. Uh... 
 Yeah? 
 Um, you... have you got anything on you? 
 Seriously? 
 I mean, I got cash. I can pay you. 
 I don't want anything anymore from you, Sheriff. 
 Do you understand me? You and me, we are straight. 
 I got my "get out of jail for free" card already. 
 And far as I'm concerned, all of this? I don't care. 
 You do one more thing, you come near me one more time, and I'll go to the state on you. Do you hear me? 
 
 
 
 Can I help you? 
 My kin was killed. I'm here to claim the body. 
 I-I remember you. 
 Asa Farrell. 
 Yeah. Wade Houghton. 
 That was, uh, quite a speech you made at that meeting. 
 Uh, yeah, look, I'm sorry if I caused you any trouble, Sheriff. 
 Oh. Uh... 
 So you say you had a, uh, family member pass on? 
 Um, you got a description? 
 Well, how many dead kids you pick up today? 
 He's about 19, 20. Long brown hair. One of us. 
 Well, uh, we don't got no unidentified bodies on premises right now. 
 Well, I went to the hospital first. 
 They said he wasn't there, but every dead body has paperwork, Sheriff, and that paperwork's a matter of public record, and it said he was in the morgue here. 
 Mm. Boy. Goddamn it. You're, uh... We... you're right, we had a young man who was killed in an accident yesterday. Um, mm, but his body was claimed. 
 Claimed by who? 
 By another jurisdiction. By Raleigh County. 
 Raleigh County, West Virginia? 
 That's right. 
 Uh, they had a missing persons report file. 
 Um, it matched the description of this young man exactly. 
 And we sent him over to them, so... 
 Uh... it can't be your cousin. I mean, I'm sorry. 
 I don't know what your game is, Sheriff, but that was my cousin Tice. 
 And his mother, why, she's beside herself right now. 
 I mean, losing someone's hard because they're gone but they're still with you. 
 I think you know what I mean by that, right? 
 Uh, I have no idea whatsoever what you're talking about. 
 If my kin isn't buried on our land, his spirit will not rest. You understand? 
 Well, you know, I mean, I was raised a Christian. 
 If his spirit doesn't rest, Wade, it's gonna come for us. 
 For his mother. And me. 
 And then you, Wade. 
 Hey, uh, we got a staff meetin'. 
 I know. Well, you take care of it. 
 All right. 
 Follow me. 
 The edict says no visitors, but I-I don't care. 
 Brought you some chicken, potatoes, corn. 
 Why would I want anything brung by you? 
 Fa... 
 I was only going along with it for show. 
 Well, felt real to me. 
 It only would've been worse if I didn't. 
 Worse than this? 
 I would rather be dead. 
 Maybe I am dead. 
 No. 
 You're all we got, fa. 
 You're the only one that knows what we should do, knows the price of our livin'. 
 You tell Shurn that I pain for her, and I'm sorry about her Tice. 
 Did already. 
 Mm. 
 Look, I'm only trying to do what's right. 
 And we got set up. 
 Maybe them boys just went down to the shop to... 
 I don't know, play cards or... 
 No, I told you. It was their church day. 
 No, they was waitin'. 
 They knew we was comin'. 
 I go talk to the elders, get a circle called. 
 They'll understand why you defied the Bren'in and how it all went dark 'cause there was some kind of forces at work... 
 No, ain't no point in that. And there weren't no forces. 
 No, it was one of us who betrayed me. 
 One of our own who has other ideas about things. 
 No, I never told G'winveer. 
 Did I say you did? 
 Look. 
 I've been doin' a lot of thinkin', so I know what we gotta do to solve this and every other problem we got. 
 Yeah. What is it, fa? 
 Now, you... 
 You care about this family more than anyone on this mountain. 
 Yeah. 
 Right? And I Cherish that. 
 I need you to do something for me. 
 I got no one else to go to. 
 I-I can't help you, fa. 
 I just need one thing. 
 How many of y'all are up there? 
 60? 
 More? 
 It's not the number that matters. 
 What matters? 
 What we believe in. 
 Which is? 
 Our freedom. 
 Are you the leader? 
 No. 
 So how's it work? You got, like, a chief? 
 A... a king? 
 What is that? Why do you assume it would be a guy? 
 Hmm? 
 You got a queen. 
 Not exactly. 
 Hey, I'm just... I'm asking 'cause I never had any interaction with y'all before. 
 Seems like you haven't had much real interaction with anybody lately. 
 I hope you don't mind me saying that. 
 No, I mean, you can say what you like. 
 You want me to be honest? I'll say this... 
 You're not just down here 'cause that boy's your kin. 
 No, there's some other reason. 
 Such as? 
 I don't readily know. 
 I'll put some music on. 
 That's not music. 
 Yeah. Yeah, I believe you're right. 
 How's your fa doin'? 
 He's okay, I guess. 
 Said he's had some time to think. 
 Brought him some chicken, then... 
 Went over to morningside for a walk and had me a think, too. 
 Hey, will you give me a hand with this? 
 That boy Tice... You know him much? 
 Not that much. 
 Yeah. His mama knew him. 
 Knew him all his life. 
 Yeah. 
 Poor Shurn. 
 Like I said, I did some thinkin'. 
 I think we were set up at that shop. 
 Set up and knocked down. 
 They knew we was coming. 
 Strange, isn't it, G'win? 
 Strange like you not telling me what you were really up to that day? 
 That's why you was holding on to that good luck shell? 
 You must've been holding it the whole time. 
 I knew you were up to no good, and I didn't want you to get hurt. 
 Well, then you got lucky on account of me. 
 Poor old Tice? Not so much. 
 Don't you feel you should go talk to his mommy? 
 You got a duty to her now? 
 Do I? 
 Foster, all I was just... 
 It's done with. 
 It stays between you and me. 
 Not sure I saw an ambo or a black-and-white out there. 
 Uh, no, ma'am, I brought my own truck. 
 Not sure we can authorize a private vehicle for transport. 
 Well, we do things different across the border. 
 You sure as hell do. 
 Evening, Foster. 
 How you doin' tonight? 
 How you think, boy? 
 I just wanted to come on down here and say sorry for delivering the sad news that got you locked up. 
 But... 
 That's the way it was. 
 Lady Ray was askin'. 
 I got no quarrel with you on that count. 
 Mm, yeah, not from where you stand, you don't. 
 Say, I got me some wine from Krake's private stock. 
 You want some? 
 No, thank you. 
 You sure? 
 No. 
 I can understand why maybe you wouldn't want to partake in this particular batch. 
 But I really think you should because it's just... It's just a fine brew. 
 Mmm. 
 It's handmade, you might say. 
 Ugh! 
 You are gonna pay for this disrespect, boy. 
 I already paid. 
 Oh, what's the matter? You scared? 
 Huh? 
 You scared to die? 
 Bullshit. 
 Bullshit. 
 Go ahead! Light me up! 
 Calm down. I ain't gonna light you up. 
 Really, I just wanted to see this. 
 You and me, we even now. 
 That's it. 
 Man, I can never get used to seeing a young kid get killed like that. 
 Killed by who? 
 Who knows? There was an eyewitness came forward, said they saw him getting thrown into the back of a van. 
 He was getting beat up. 
 It's gotta be drugs. 
 Well, he'd never been off the mountain before, so I kinda doubt it. 
 Someone sure took issue with him. 
 Who? 
 I know as much as you do. 
 I saw the M.E. report in your hands there. 
 It said 10-47 based on his injuries. 
 That's a hit-and-run. 
 I mean, he had windshield glass embedded in his scalp, right? 
 I can tell you, we will be doin' a full investigation. 
 Well, how the hell did he end up in West Virginia, anyway? 
 How would I know that? 
 You know something? 
 You live for a while without tv and video games and all these distractions, you're not numbed out all the time. 
 You learn how to listen to the quality of a person's voice, read their face. 
 What I'm trying to say is, Wade, I know you're lying to me. 
 My daddy... 
 You know, he worked for the coal company. 
 Not this one. It was another one that was called, um, Biloxi. 
 When I was a little boy, they sent him up the mountain, throw you folks off of there. 
 Did not end well. 
 Two days later, he was struck and killed by lightning. 
 One month later was the great lower fork mine explosion. 
 11 men died that day under the ground. 
 And I said to myself "I will not go to work for them. I will not go to work for big coal. I'm gonna help people." 
 I went into law enforcement, and here I am, tasked with the job of evicting you. 
 And that is not the side that I wanna be on. 
 You understand me? 
 Whose side are you on, Wade? 
 Who do you goddamn think? 
 That's why I'm doing this. 
 I want you to know, I mean you folks no harm. 
 Maybe I should drive. 
 Yeah. 
 Elderberry? 
 Dewberry. 
 Of course. 
 But it's not doing like it was. 
 Ah... 
 I get more tired every day. 
 You like a bath? 
 I'll get the boys to bring some water up. 
 Now that's a fine thought. Thank you. 
 I'll go and fetch 'em. 
 I wanted to ask you, did you get an answer? 
 To what? 
 To this... 
 Can you trust him? 
 And you know who I mean. 
 Well, he's down there gettin' the boy's body. 
 He's a brave soul, he is. 
 But every time I look at that Asa, it's like I'm seein' double. 
 Two people. One dark, the other good. 
 Prophecy talk of one who returns. 
 I thought all along that he was that one. 
 But now I'm not sure if it's him should lead us. 
 Why not? 
 The strongest should. 
 And you do agreeth with me on that? 
 W-well, yes, ma'am, but... 
 Who is that? 
 You know who it is... 
 And so do i. 
 Oh, ma'am, I... 
 I don't know what exactly... 
 Oh, don't play humble now, girl. 
 You know your power and you know what you want. 
 Don't be afraid of it. 
 Yes, ma'am. 
 You are a true daughter of this mountain. 
 You are its blood and its fire. 
 Foster. You awake? 
 Need anything? 
 No. 
 Brought you some smokes. I know you like 'em. 
 Your boy was just trying to make things easier. 
 We'll get ya out of here. Don't worry. 
 How'd you do it? 
 How'd you get out? 
 I ain't gonna be long. 
 Look at you. 
 I ain't never seen you naked like this before. 
 Sure you did, only you don't remember. 
 You were just a baby, sweet little thing I could hold in one hand like a doll. 
 In one hand like a doll so's you could beat me with the other. 
 You were right, what you said. 
 One of us is bound to break the rule. 
 A Farrell's gonna kill another one of these days, only that day, it's now. 
 I seen it coming. 
 Prophecy say a demon among us, and I know who it be. 
 Promise me just one thing, child. 
 Don't leave me here. 
 Take me to the bed so's I won't be found like this. 
 Yeah, ma. 
 I will. 
 But you didn't see this coming, 'cause you ain't seen nothing coming. 
 And that's why I'm doing this. 
 This family needs a leader who sees, who's ready to fight. 
 You think I got no fight? 
 No, I think that you are twisted in the head, imagining old ways and tales even a child knows is foolery. 
 Is they? 
 How would you know? 
 'Cause if any of it was true, I wouldn't be here, doing what I'm about to do. 
 How do you even know you can do it? 
 You ain't even tried yet. 
 Why are we stopping here? 
 Come on, give me a hand. 
 Strange. 
 What's that? 
 You can't even look at him. 
 You've seen dead bodies. 
 You've been a cop for a while. 
 It was an accident. 
 It was an accident. 
 He come out of nowhere. 
 I was turning around, he was there. 
 You gotta tell your people I'm sorry. 
 I didn't mean to hurt him. You can't... 
 I have a little boy. 
 Uhh! 
 You listen to me, Wade. 
 That mountain's gonna come for you. 
 You understand me? Just like it did your daddy. 
 Now you're gonna make 'em stop. 
 You're gonna make 'em back off for good. 
 Or your little boy... 
 He's dead. 
 Leave us alone, Wade. 
 Thank you. 
 Thank you, Asa. 
 What's going on? 
 The Bren'in is dead. 
 Long live the Bren'in. 
 Foster... 
 A dreadful day. 
 Your mother has passed. 
 Then kneel before your king.
