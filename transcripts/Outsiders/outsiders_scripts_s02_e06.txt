 - And don't you never come back. 
- Hey, you want to come see   
 if you can show me where your parents' house is?   
 HOUGHTON: You can't stay with me, Sam.   
 I promise you, she's gonna look after you, okay?   
 (panting, groaning) Goddamn.   
 - I'm pregnant. 
- G'WIN:  You're man enough   
 to create a life; you are man enough to make a decision.   
 HASIL:  That child's half a Farrell, and he's gonna be   
 - born half a Farrell. 
- SALLY-ANN:  We're kind of   
 stuck without a place to go. If you just let us stay here    
 a couple more days till we figure things out.    
 BUTCH: Look, man. I'm selling tonight. I could use someone    
 to watch my back. I'll kick you a couple bucks.    
 Easy money. What do you say?    
 (crowd clamoring)    
 - Times are tough. 
- Yeah, well, been made tougher    
 by that sister of yours and her gang of bitches.    
 Next time, chain 'em up.    
 While you're here, I'm gonna give you basic survival advice.    
 Keep your head down. And be very careful who you trust.    
 Got something for you. A gift.    
 From the brotherhood.    
 Smash his skull like a watermelon.

 You don't fool me, Farrell.    
 There's a bloodthirsty lion in you.

 The fire was by Kinnah hand.    
 G'WIN:  Moregon killed Hezzy.   
 - She's up to something. 
She's got to go. - (grunts)

- Always.

 Well, you could do that.    
 But you'd probably die trying.    
 And you would do it anyway, I know.    
 But right now, the Bren'in, she's got a gun to her head.    
 So nobody tries nothing.    
 What do they want with her, anyways?    
 You stay here. I mean it.    
 They killed Hezzy, too.    
 - Burnt him alive. 
- This is a calamity.    
 Never in our history has the Bren'in    
 been held prisoner by our own clan.    
 They ain't our clan.

 Actions speak louder.    
 I agree with you, Mr. Farrell.    
 But the stench of them.    
 I mean... (coughs): Oh! Come on.    
 Can't you smell it? Really?    
 You know, I got a pretty good sense of smell, and I don't think it was them.    
 Maybe it's your upper lip?    
 (laughs)    
 You, you, my friend,    
 you're as pure as the driven snow.    
 I love that phrase.    
 Etymology: Shakespeare,  A Winter's Tale.   
 Snow so white and pure,    
 it's yet to be poisoned by this wicked world.    
 Just like you.    
 I'm proud to have a pure being such as yourself among us, sir.    
 I've chosen you, and you will join me.    
 One, because in hell, you don't have a choice.    
 Two, because you're the whitest man    
 to sh1t inside these walls since I walked in here    years ago.    
 We're pure, we're clean.    
 We share the same heart.    
 Understand?    
 ♪ ♪    
 (door opens, closes)    
 What do you want?    
 I have offered you everything we have.     
 MOREGON: And we are grateful.     
 I commend you for holding fast     
 to so many of your generous ways.     
 And for understanding     
 that the modern world has poisoned us all.     
 We agree on that.     
 So pardon me for my confusion.     
 - About? 
- You believe it's wrong     
 to be dependent on their machines.     
 - It is. 
- And yet,     
 you've stolen our guns.     
 Seems you're a bit dependent on them right now.     
 Leadership is not easy.     
 Remaining true to what we believe,     
 to this mountain, this  talamh,   
 means that difficult choices must be made.     
 Especially when there are those who refuse to understand.     
 G'WIN: Yes.     
 I refuse to understand that someone has to die     
 - so that you can prove to... 
- When I told you     
 we burnt the smokehouse     
 because the meat was tainted, what did you do?     
 You ran straightaway to a drunken man for help.     
 Which confirmed what I wish were not true:     
 you're weak.     
 And that we had no choice but to steal     
 your own fire to convince you     
 to let us do what we came here to do.     
 Which is what?     
 Cosain fuil ond fuil.   
 "Only blood can save blood"?     
 When our people came to this continent,     
 we brought with us all the ancient rites,     
 the ones the Christians tried to kill.     
 We held fast to them.     
 And when we settled up here,     
 safe from the so-called Americans,     
 we began to lose hold of them.     
 That is why the Kinnah left.     
 Only blood can save blood,     
 so the strongest of you must die.     
 - What are you talking about? 
- A purification by blood.     
 To rid us of all the ills you brought up     
 onto this sacred hill.     
 - A sacrifice. 
- Tomorrow eve.     
 - At the full moon. 
- Well, it will never happen.     
 MOREGON: I so wanted to teach you.     
 For you to join me,     
 for us to save this clan together.     
 You're gonna kill a man for his blood.     
 Not me.     
 You.     
 Moregon, I let you live among us.     
 I agreed we needed to change.     
 I sought your counsel, but th...     
 this is madness.     
 No! It's what we believe!     
 We are not murderers.     
 We are a family.     
 And your beloved husband... isn't he a killer?     
 And you? Didn't you try to murder him?     
 - You failed, but still. 
- I failed     
 because Farrells don't kill Farrells.     
 - I see. 
- I won't do it.     
 MOREGON: No, he is not the strongest of you.     
 He is just one of your family.     
 And every hour, one will die...     
 until you agree.     
 So go on, tell this boy that you're too weak     
 to do your duty     
 and purify this mountain as the Bren'in must.     
 No.     
 - (gunshot) 
- SHURN: They shot her!     
 - They shot the Bren'in! 
- (clamoring)     
 Foster, no!     
 You want to shoot? 
Go ahead and shoot me!     
 (gasping)     
 (crying)     
 (whispers): G'Winveer.     
 A man who is willing to die for someone he loves.     
 He is the strongest.     
 (G'Win continues crying)     
 Take him away.     
 - Why? What number's that? 
- SALLY-ANN:    .     
 Dollars?     
 - For rent. 
- For rent.     
 Which is...?     
 Are you kidding me?     
 - No. 
- You're not.     
 Okay. So rent is money that you pay for a place to live.     
 Well, it just seems like an odd notion to me, but go on.     
 And I... we can't stay here anymore.     
 Babies and bongs don't really go together.     
 My brother is crazy, and "crazy" is not even the word     
 I'd begin to use to describe your family.     
 We need a place of our own.     
 - Agreed? 
- I agree.     
 Yeah. Uh, I-I agree, no questions.     
 What's that?     
 That's $   , for food, furnishings,     
 like a bed, a table, microwave.     
 And the rest of this stuff is basics.     
 Just dish soap, toilet paper.     
 Stop.     
 I know you know what toilet paper is.     
 - All right. 
- And after that, we have     
 the weekly fare for the bus, in case we need to go anywhere,     
 and then we have utilities.     
 - Which are what? 
- Utilities are electric,     
 gas, water.     
 What do you mean, water? You pay for water?     
 We pay for water, babe. You know that.     
 You got to pay for water? Wh...     
 Well, what about air? Hmm?     
 How much, how much the air cost down here?     
 - I'm being serious. 
- (scoffs)     
 And we haven't even gotten to the biggest one.     
 - What's that? 
- Doctor's bills.     
 I told you, the free clinic is closed.     
 We're gonna have to pay for everything out of pocket.     
 Do you understand what I'm telling you?     
 - Yeah. 
- I'd go get a payday loan,     
 but I can't get a payday loan if I don't have a payday.     
 And I don't have a job.     
 And, baby, neither do you.     
 You know what? Just forget it.     
 I-I don't even know what it is that I'm trying to do here.     
 - Wait, wait. Whoa, whoa. 
-I get that you don't understand.     
 - Whoa, whoa, hey, hey, hey. 
- And it's just...     
 - It's too hard for me to... 
- Hey. Stop, stop.     
 Stop.     
 It's gonna be all right.     
 Me and Butch, we're working on something.     
 I'm gonna get us money. It's gonna be fine.     
 You and Butch are gonna get money together?     
 Selling drugs?     
 That's gonna be fine?     
 - I already told you, I'm not bringing a baby... - Hey.     
 - ...to come visit you in jail. 
- No. It ain't drugs.     
 It ain't moonshine. 
I ain't selling nothing.     
 What, then?     
 I just need you to trust me.     
 - Okay? 
- Okay.     
 Hey, Sam. How are you?     
 - Okay. 
- Mm.     
 Um, can I sit down?     
 (sighs)     
 Hey, um, Sam, I found your house.     
 It was right by the bear.     
 Just like you said.     
 I found your folks.     
 Do you know what happened to them, Sam?     
 Can I ask you about it?     
 Anything you saw that you want to tell me about,     
 you can tell me about it.     
 You don't have to be scared.     
 This is a great place and you're real safe here.     
 - He told me not to look. 
- Somebody told you not to look?     
 - The big man. 
- A big man?     
 Was he a friend of your parents? 
Did they know him?     
 - He was a stranger? 
- Yeah.     
 What'd he look like, Sam?     
 He was big, long hair, and, um...     
 - What do you mean, Sam? 
You mean like tattoos? - Mm-hmm.     
 Sam, uh...     
 I'm gonna...     
 I'm gonna show you a photograph, okay?     
 It's not scary. 
I just want you to tell me if this is the man that you saw.     
 Is that him?     
 More old with long white hair.     
 He's a big guy?     
 Older guy? Long white hair?     
 - Did he tell you his name? 
- Mm.     
 LEDDA: Well, okay. Let's talk about the Coal Days Festival.     
 (crowd murmurs)     
 I think that we need some new ideas.     
 I see a lot of new faces here today, which is great.     
 Anybody?     
 Well, won't we have a booth set up near the parade?     
 LEDDA: We will, but I think     
 - that we can do better than that, don't you? - Yes.     
 You mean you want to do an action there?     
 - Yes I do. 
- Like what?     
 - That's what we're here to sort out. 
- POLLY: Ledda,     
 Coal Days is something everybody in this town loves. Right?     
 I mean, my kids look forward to that parade for months.     
 - I know and so do mine. 
- POLLY: We just did an action.     
 Not the most popular thing I've ever been involved with.     
 And now you want to go really pissing everybody in town off     
 by ruining their summer fun?     
 That's not gonna get us any likes.     
 Pardon me, but, uh...     
 it's not about the likes.     
 - Hi, everybody. 
- Hi.     
 My name is Gordon.     
 I'm not from here, but I heard about you guys     
 from all the way across the country.     
 You guys are amazing, just amazing.     
 Well, thank you.     
 When I saw that video,     
 and your courage and your passion...     
 you're my hero.     
 Seriously.     
 So, look, I'm just here to help, if you need me.     
 I've worked on a lot of campaigns:     
 fracking in Pennsylvania, tar sands pipeline,     
 deforestation.     
 And if you don't mind me saying,     
 an action at the Coal Days Festival, a real action,     
 Ledda here is    % right.     
 Now is not the time to back off.     
 Now is the time to show people how strong we really are.     
 (crowd murmuring)     
 (security alarm blaring)     
 GUARD: Everybody on the ground! Now! Now!     
 Get him off.     
 (handcuffs click)     
 A real man fights his own battles.     
 BIG FOSTER: So you're asking me to believe     
 that this utter damnable madness will save us?     
 How do you think we thrived     
 up on this rock for all these years?     
 Do you think that coal company is the first threat we've seen?     
 There were winters so harsh     
 the trees were frozen dead and cracked apart in the breeze.     
 There were infestations, famines.     
 What you face now, it's a child's game.     
 You've forgotten the  cyfraiths,   
 the  creideamhs,  the old laws.     
 You Farrells, you're the Losties, not them below.     
 I never believed her.     
 - My mother. 
- Why would you?     
 - She was a woman. 
- No, but she was right.     
 - MOREGON: About? 
- About you.     
 Prophecy of a demon among us.     
 I'm looking at her right now.     
 And all she wants is power.     
 No. Not in the least.     
 Tomorrow, when all this is done,     
 and the goodness of the mountain has been restored,     
 we Kinnah will be gone.     
 And your people, truly, know this, Foster:     
 they will thank you for what you've done.     
 Because in dying,     
 you'll finally become the man you've always wanted to be.     
 G'Winveer,     
 - she will never do it. 
- Because she's your wife.     
 She poisoned you.     
 Just like your mother did.     
 No.     
 She's one of us now, a believer.     
 She just needed a bit of persuading.     
 I don't believe it.     
 She will perform her part in the rite     
 because she loves her people.     
 And also because, in her heart,     
 she wants to see you dead.     
 - So you drove from Oregon? 
- Santa Cruz.     
 One shot, didn't even stop to eat.     
 (chuckles) As you can no doubt tell.     
 (laughs) Not a lot of     
 - vegan options on the interstate, I'm guessing. - No.     
 So thank you very much for feeding me.     
 You know, people around here seem really generous.     
 - So you were born in Blackburg you said? - Mm-hmm.     
 How lucky of you.     
 You're not serious.     
 Look, I've lived in a lot of places in my life,     
 and this really is...     
 I was gonna say God's country,     
 but I'm not really religious.     
 You okay with that?     
 Yeah. We're not as narrow-minded as people might think.     
 - We crazy Christians. 
- Same with us atheists.     
 Although, I'm not really sure about that label, you know?     
 I'm a spiritual guy.     
 I don't know, maybe I'm just... God-curious.     
 - You know what I mean? 
- Mm-hmm.     
 So, how'd you get into all this, anyway?     
 Well, I was gonna be a tech whiz,     
 startup billionaire, you know.     
 I went to Stanford when I was   ,     
 then straight to Google.     
 Then one day, I read about how they were gonna destroy     
 Creek River in Oregon to put up a dam.     
 - Mm-hmm. 
- Something about it.     
 I went up there for a protest and... never came back.     
 So I quit my job, bought the camper,     
 and now I drive around the country     
 milching food off people I barely even met.     
 Have at it.     
 My girls don't like raw vegetables, anyway.     
 - Few sane people do. 
- (chuckles)     
 So what about you? How'd you get into this?     
 You know, I never really had anything against coal mining,     
 'cause those are the only jobs.     
 But then when they said     
 they were gonna blow up Shay Mountain,     
 I just couldn't watch that happen.     
 I mean, this mountain is a part of me.     
 I've seen it every day of my life.     
 Like, literally, I mean that.     
 So folks around here are pro-coal because they need jobs.     
 - They do, but... 
- So everybody must think     
 that you're on the wrong side, huh?     
 Yes.     
 You know, where I'm from, everybody thinks I'm a hero.     
 But you,     
 I mean, you're the really brave one here.     
 I mean, you're really a hero.     
 I mean that.     
 You know, the thing is, when I was a little girl,     
 I was taught to be seen and not heard.     
 You got to go along to get along, my mom used to say.     
 So when I started this thing, it felt... wrong.     
 Really wrong.     
 And then I realized that I liked feeling wrong.     
 Like, it felt right to be wrong.     
 Do you know what I mean?     
 Can I ask you a serious question?     
 Sure.     
 Do I smell?     
 (both laughing)     
 Are you actually asking me?     
 - Because... 
- No, because I know I do.     
 I mean, my camper's got a solar bag,     
 - but that thing's been empty for a long time. - (laughs)     
 Uh, there's a shower upstairs if that's what you're getting at.     
 Well, I think Mother Earth will thank you personally.     
 - Let me get you a towel. 
- Thank you.     
 Oh. Um... Sorry. Hey.     
 Do you want to join me?     
 Or would that be wrong?     
 DR. MEHTA: I was hoping you took my advice     
 to keep your head down.     
 Hmm. Tried to.     
 But it gave the shorter ones an easier target.     
 You have to find a way to keep them away.     
 The guards saw them attack you.     
 That's the only reason you're not in Ad Seg.     
 But you should be, and I can recommend it,     
 say that you're a danger to the other inmates.     
 No. I ain't doing that.     
 It's the only place we can guarantee your safety.     
 You know, if I only know one thing, Doc,     
 it's that you got to be real careful     
 about what you give away just to feel safe.     
 I spent every day of my life with the sun on my face,     
 but when I was down there, I couldn't even see the sky.     
 I ain't going back there.     
 I need to see daylight.     
 DR. MEHTA:That's beautiful. 
Is that your home?     
 No. I don't know where that is.     
 My home is too beautiful to put down on paper.     
 - (chuckles): So is mine. 
- Where are you from?     
 - India. 
- Why'd y'all leave?     
 Oh, they wanted a better life.     
 They find it?     
 Where I come from,     
 they put you in a cage to help you think about     
 what it is you did that might have hurt somebody.     
 This place... I don't know what this is.     
 Hmm.     
 Oh.     
 Thank you.

 Lady Ray.     
 I always knew you were the one to lead this clan, child.     
 And look at you now.     
 It's not all I hoped it would be, ma'am.     
 Never is.     
 Sure wasn't for me.     
 I failed them.     
 And you.     
 Nonsense. You just begun.     
 All this, twill be ending one day soon.     
 How?     
 They've killed three of us already.     
 And I cannot let that keep happening.     
 One more person dies, and then it's done with     
 - and they go. 
- But he's your son.     
 - I know that. 
- And he's my husband.     
 And you wanted him dead.     
 I did.     
 And then I didn't. I...     
 Kill him now.     
 And then it's over.     
 So you believe them?     
 Doing this will save us?     
 This-this sacrifice, it... it was once our way?     
 You severely screwed the pooch on that one, didn't you?     
 I don't even know what that means.     
 I told you to lose.     
 sh1t. I even bet money on your ass to lose.     
 You peckerhead. 
You just cost me     bucks.     
 I'm sorry, Butch. Just... I don't know.     
 Something about him, something bothered me.     
 MAN: What up, Butch?     
 Now...     
 I heard these Farrells are pretty damn tough.     
 You think I'm an idiot.     
 I see your game here.     
 He just didn't play along, did he?     
 Butch.     
 I am gonna let this slide this one time.     
 - Okay? 
- Yeah.     
 Now, you think your boy's ready for the real thing?     
 Yeah. Sure, Zacman.     
 Well, good.     
 You see that guy Edgar with the ponytail down there?     
 He just paid me three bills to fight your Farrell.     
 He says he don't much like freakazoids.     
 You game?     
 - Hmm? 
- Yeah, yeah, sure.     
 
 
 
 Just let me talk to my boy, okay?     
 All right.     
 (sniffs) End of the card, then.     
 I'll be lining up the bets.     
 Make it happen, Butch.     
 'Cause it's gonna be big.     
 Most def.     
 Don't you be telling me that I got to lose this one, too.     
 There's more money to be made winning, Butch.     
 - You ought to know that. 
- Duh.     
 - But he's three times your size. 
- Now, come on.     
 Ain't you ever heard big men fall hard?     
 Ain't happening, bro.     
 Look, we're in this together.     
 If you go in there and get your neck broke     
 by that guy, then my business model's fracked, all right?     
 I'll come up around him so fast     
 he ain't gonna know which way is up.     
 - I beat you, didn't I? 
- (scoffs) Funny.     
 All I'm saying is, as your partner and de facto manager,     
 I do not recommend this as your first real fight.     
 Should you choose to do it,     
 - I may have to bet against you. 
- Let me tell you something,     
 my first real fight happened the day I was born.     
 I'm gonna win this.     
 (crowd cheering)     
 (whooping)     
 Hey. Not bad for a rookie.     
 Look, I got guys all the way from Barbourville     
 that would love a shot at that kid.     
 (cheering)     
 Well, let me check his schedule.     
 Whatever it takes, man.     
 I'll make it happen.     
 - Who owes me? 
- Come on!     
 Sorry again if you bet on the bigger horse, Butch.     
 I ain't no fool, Hasil. I was just trying to motivate you.     
 - How's that eye? 
- You're so full of sh1t.     
 You didn't think I could beat him.     
 Yeah, whatever, dude.     
 Hold out your hand.     
 Come on, now.     
 Hasil Farrell, you're a rich man.     
 (chuckles)     
 (basketball bouncing)     
 JAGER: Mr. Farrell.     
 You said you respect a man who fights his own fights.     
 I agree.     
 Hey, I'm talking to you, animal.     
 Listen, I ain't afraid of you.     
 - None of you. 
- Never said you were.     
 You're afraid of yourself.     
 Afraid of what you really are.     
 You don't know nothing about me.     
 (chuckles) You're right about that.     
 I thought you were a pure being,     
 but you're nothing of the kind.     
 So...     
 my offer of brotherhood...     
 is rescinded.     
 (crowd cheering, clamoring)     
 (groans loudly)     
 Yeah! Kill him!     
 You couldn't do it.     
 (laughs)     
 (grunts)     
 - (security alarm blaring) 
- GUARD: On the ground!     
 - You, don't move! 
- Get down! Now!     
 Faces down!     
 (handcuffs clicking)     
 (panting)     
 - Hey. 
- Oh. Hey, Wade.     
 There's a plate in the fridge ready to microwave.     
 Oh. Okay.     
 (typing)     
 Girls had dance class,     
 so I figured I would just feed them before they went.     
 And, uh, Caleb's over next door if you want to call him.     
 Okay.     
 Uh... Hey, um...     
 I come home to have lunch yesterday.     
 I think I heard you in the shower.     
 Thought I heard someone in there with you.     
 What if the girls had a come home instead of me?     
 They're at school.     
 - You know that. 
- Is this a joke?     
 - Who is he? 
- It's none of your business.     
 What's the matter with you? 
Your husband just died.     
 Spare me your moral outrage, Wade.     
 - You've got no place to talk. 
- I got no place to talk?     
 I think there's something the matter with you.     
 - What? 
- First this group of yours, now this.     
 Really? I'm sick and that's how you're gonna talk to me?     
 Yeah. You want to hear talking?     
 - I ain't even started talking. 
- You know what, Wade?     
 - No. -I think maybe you're the one with the real...     
 (window shatters)     
 - Oh, sh1t! 
- sh1t!     
 (tires screeching)     
 (panting)     
 See what you're bringing down on us?     
 - This is your fault. 
- Why?     
 - What are you saying, Wade? 
- Do me a favor. You want to look     
 for that cat of yours, go look in the trash.     
 - 'Cause that's where it is. 
- What are you talking about?     
 I found it dead in the mailbox yesterday.     
 Wrapped in one of those flyers you're so proud of.     
 - Why didn't you tell me that? 
- What's next, Ledda?     
 What's it gonna be? 
Someone shooting up the house?     
 We got a dead cat; you want dead girls?     
 'Cause that's what it's gonna be.     
 You need to quit that group of yours.     
 Yeah. I'm not gonna do that, Wade.     
 That is never gonna happen, okay?     
 Well, then I'm gonna take your girls away from you     
 - before one of them can get hurt. - Okay, that is insane.     
 You think I'm not being serious?!     
 - Yeah. 
- You're not right!     
 - You're not right in the head, Ledda! 
- I'm not right?     
 I'm not right in the head? 
God, I can't believe you, Wade.     
 You know what? I'll be gone soon enough.     
 And then you can have my girls for good, how's that?     
 Finished?     
 'Cause I'm gonna go in there and pack a bag     
 for Caleb and the girls, 'cause we can't stay here.     
 SALLY-ANN: Close your eyes.     
 Come on. Close 'em.     
 (chuckles) All right.     
 Okay. Are they closed?     
 - Yeah. 
- (laughs): Okay.     
 - Okay, open them. 
- Yeah.     
 Open them now.     
 That's, uh...     
 Wait, wait, wait, wait.     
 Uh, you have to carry me over the threshold.     
 - Huh? 
- You have to pick me up     
 and carry me in.     
 I know it's stupid, but I saw it on, like,     
 - Million Dollar Listing on TV, so just...   
 - Okay.     
 - Just do it. 
- Don't know what that is, but...     
 - (both laugh) 
- (Hasil grunts)     
 (both sigh)     
 - You want to grab that for me? 
- I will.     
 (laughs)     
 (door closes)     
 (sighs)     
 - It's big. It's big. 
- Mm-hmm.     
 It's so... It's so big I lost you.     
 - I can't even see you anymore. 
- (laughing)     
 Can't find you. Where'd you go?     
 Come on, now.     
 I'm over here. (laughs)     
 I know.     
 So you gonna tell me how you got this black eye?     
 Or do I have to guess?     
 I fight.     
 I fight people.     
 Thought so.     
 You be safe.     
 You're all I have now, Hasil.     
 Same here.     
 This is it.     
 You and me.     
 - All right? 
- Mm-hmm.     
 Babe, so, um...     
 I was thinking table and, like, three chairs.     
 A rug to cover up these stains.     
 A couple of lamps.     
 Shelves.     
 - Sure. 
- (both laugh)     
 What, uh, about the bed?     
 Uh... I was thinking maybe here.     
 - Right there? 
- Yeah.     
 That is the only other place for it to go.     
 (laughs) Okay. All right, all right.     
 That's good. Here's good.     
 - I like here. 
- Me, too.     
 Here it is, then. Come here.     
 (Sally-Ann laughs, Hasil growls)     
 (both chuckle softly)     
 Sheriff. Ballistics report came back     
 on that weapon from the Chimney Road house.     
 You were right. That Farrell didn't kill your brother-in-law.     
 So I guess we still got to find the guy now.     
 Wonder how we're gonna do that.     
 Hey, come on in, Sheriff.     
 I want you out of my station house right now.     
 - Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. 
- You railroaded that kid     
 on that murder charge. I told you he was innocent and he was.     
 - You can pack up all your stuff right now. - Hold on, Wade.     
 - Yo-yo-yo-yo-yo-yo-yo. 
- Hey, don't "yo" me, asshole.     
 I found a gun out at the site of that triple homicide     
 out on Chimney Road.     
 Ballistics match the gun that killed Breece Dobbs.     
 Fingerprints came back, Foster Farrell's not a match.     
 I want you to clear all your stuff.     
 Get out of here. I'm calling the state's attorney about you.     
 And then I'm gonna get a lawyer to get him out of there.     
 Wait, wait, wait. Stop, stop.     
 You know who I was just on the phone with?     
 Marsil.     
 Foster Farrell killed an inmate.     
 Broke his neck.     
 What?     
 No. I don't believe you.     
 Why not?     
 Is it because you had a hunch that he was a good man?     
 Well, guess what. He's not a good man.     
 Not at all.     
 Nice police work, though. Well done.     
 (coughs)     
 (sighs)     
 (sighing)     
 (sighs)     
 (sighs)     
 Hey, Ledda.     
 Can I talk to you for a moment?     
 What?     
 I'm sorry.     
 I'm sorry for what I said before.     
 I didn't mean it.     
 Okay.     
 You know, uh...     
 Uh, you say, you know,     
 you say everything happened for a reason.     
 Yeah.     
 I think ev-everything happened for a reason.     
 Um, wh-what are you talking about?     
 It's not your fault; it's mine.     
 I don't understand. What, what is?     
 All this. I mean...     
 All of this is my fault.     
 I didn't do something when I should have.     
 Now, I-I know what I have to do,     
 but it's not necessarily legal.     
 - Wade... 
- It's all right.     
 I can handle it.     
 Yeah, I'm gonna take care of it.     
 I'm gonna go say good night to the kids.
