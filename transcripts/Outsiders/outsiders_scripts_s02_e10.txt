 -  Previously on  Outsiders... 
- GUARD:  Anybody wants to go past  this point here, I got to clear it with Mr. Meyers' office.   
 MEYERS:  As far as the Farrells, things will be  a little different on that front from now on.   
 HOUGHTON: With things amping up, I can't protect you.   
 So I think it'd be better if you just disappear.   
 Okay.   
 SALLY-ANN:  What are you looking at?   
 HASIL: Looks like I got me a fight club fan.    
 Wade? Wade Houghton?    
 Dana Miller. 
We should get drinks sometime.    
 LEDDA:  I was visited, Wade.   
 I think it was Breece.   
 He doesn't want me to be scared.    
 What's the matter?    
 The hospital called.    
 I'm in remission.    
 You should take a rest.    
 Doesn't help anyone, especially not the baby.    
 (helicopter whirring)    
 G'WIN:  The coal company poisoned our fields.   
 Sweet Allis Spring, too. 
The time for peace is over.   
 So I think we get one of them up here.   
 Make them face us.   
 Hasil?    
 Uh, sorry.    
 G'WIN:  We got that coal boss coming up here.   
 And her fate will be tied to ours.   
 She will sit at our table and she will drink our water.    
 - (grunting) 
- Put me down!    
 Let me down now!    
 (panting)    
 Ow!    
 (sniffles)    
 BIG FOSTER: Ain't no time to rest.    
 - On your feet. 
- Can't.    
 - Come on. 
- I said I can't...    
 Ow...    
 Aah...    
 (screaming)    
 Folks don't know these woods tend to lose their way.    
 You need help? Huh?

 BARBARA: Are you sure?    
 I kind of liked it.    
 LIL FOSTER: It's old.    
 (speaking native language)    
 (scoffs)    
 HOUGHTON: I mean, what am I supposed to be looking at?    
 DR. SCHREIER: That dark shadow.    
 Well which one is a month ago?    
 DR. SCHREIER: The one on the left.    
 HOUGHTON: How'd it go from that big to nothing?    
 Well, it went from four centimeters to less than two, which is not quite nothing.    
 But Ledda's officially in remission.    
 Yeah, so, she didn't have any chemotherapy.    
 She didn't have radiation, n-nothing.    
 I mean, she didn't have anything.    
 What happened?    
 Wade, will you stop looking for bad news?    
 I told you, God has a plan for me.    
 Thank you. 
Y-You have a good day too. Bye.    
 (Hasil grunts)    
 I have a job interview.    
 - Don't say? 
- (giggles)    
 Ain't that fine? (chuckles)    
 - Do you know what that is? 
- Well, I heard the word "job," and I seen you smiling, so I figured it must be a good thing.    
 Well, I don't have the job yet, but they're thinking of hiring me.    
 So, just need to meet the boss first, and if he likes me...    
 That boss, he's gonna see you like I do.    
 He's gonna love you.    
 (exhales)    
 (grunts)    
 - Dang it. 
- You okay?    
 Yeah, I'm just a bit disturbed from the last fight.    
 Come on. Come on.    
 (moans)    
 (inhales, exhales)    
 Whoa, that's nice.    
 You should stop fighting.    
 Oh, come on. I'm fit as a fiddle.     
 What if that sheriff finds you?     
 Look, the sheriff, he's not coming for me. All right?     
 All I'm saying is how do you know?     
 He told you he didn't want to see you down here again.     
 Could be at every fight club, just waiting to catch you.     
 If I stop, how are we gonna make do?     
 I got this job interview.     
 I've applied all over the place,     
 I'll get a second job, if we need it.     
 (sighs)     
 We'll be okay.     
 Okay?     
 (people muttering)     
 Ah!     
 My name is G'Winveer Farrell, and I'm Bren'in to this clan.     
 You must be thirsty.     
 This water, it comes fresh from our spring.     
 Why am I here?     
 Because you lead that coal company.     
 (laughs) No, no, no.     
 There's been a big misunderstanding.     
 I don't lead One Planet.     
 Um...     
 Hello, everybody.     
 Hi.     
 My name is Haylie Grimes, and I'm the head of community relations.     
 Hi. (chuckles)     
 It's so nice to meet y'all.     
 (clears throat)     
 Uh...     
 Just outside of Blackburg, we've built these wonderful condos, these living spaces just for you.     
 They're, um, one to three bedrooms.     
 They have all new appliances, that can, can cook, and keep food cold.     
 Uh, my job is to help y'all.     
 Uh...     
 Wait.     
 You promised she'd drink the water.     
 (excited chatter)     
 If she knew about the water, she would not have raised the jar to her lips.     
 No matter. She's with the coal company, she drinks.     
 (excited chatter)     
 Quiet!     
 That would make us no better than those who harmed us.     
 What's with your water?     
 Come with me.     
 CROWD: Yeah!     
 WOMAN: Get out of here.

 G'WIN: Hmm.     
 Your village is really very impressive, G'Winveer.     
 You know, I never thought it would be so planned and organized.     
 All the craftsmanship was really very...     
 (coughs)     
 Ugh...     
 (coughing continues)     
 This was our best spring.     
 Poisoned.     
 I showed you mercy not having you drink that water.     
 Mercy not shown to us.     
 Who did this?     
 You did.     
 Your coal company.     
 W... Wait a minute, what am I doing?     
 - How do you punch? 
- Press X, man.     
 Well, I'm doing it, but it's not letting me hit you.     
 - Why can't I hit you? 
- That's 'cause I'm hitting you.     
 Well, would you stop for a spell and let me hit you?     
 Check it out.     
 (video game characters grunting)     
 (roars, yells)     
 Did you just tear my leg off?     
 Ha-ha-ha! Fatality.     
 Mortal Kombat!     
 You want to play again?     
 - No. 
- All right.     
 So, Butch, I need to...     
 I need to talk to you.     
 Damn.     
 Sounds serious.     
 Yeah. Look, it, uh... this ain't an easy decision, but I can't do fight club anymore.     
 What the hell are you talking about, man? Fight's tonight!     
 I know. -And you can't back out at the last minute.     
 Think of all the money we're gonna... you're gonna make.     
 Look, if I get caught, it doesn't matter how much paper I got.     
 Ain't that some sh1t.     
 I open my house to you, let you crash on my couch, let you eat my food, and you smoke my weed if you wanted to... you didn't; that's  your  loss.     
 And this is your "Thanks, Butch"?     
 - It's my sorry to you, Butch. 
- You already gave me your sorry once, remember?     
 Now what are you gonna give me, a wood-carved jackass or something?     
 - Oh, that's funny. 
- I mean, seriously, how are you gonna support Sally-Ann and that baby?     
 Look, man, if you're worried about the po-po, I'll take care of it.     
 I'll keep an eye out... first sign of 'em,     
 I'll give you the signal: whoop-whoop!     
 We'll get you out of there in a flash.     
 This ain't gonna work. 
See, it's too risky.     
 Sally-Ann ain't gonna go for that. -(sighs)     
 You just need to finish up a few more fights, jail-free, and once you're bringing home wads and wads of paper for that sweet little baby, Sally-Ann will see that it's all good, and then she'll say,     
 (high-pitched): 
"Oh, Hasil, I love you so much."     
 She ain't never said that to me before.     
 She will now.     
 I promise, my dude.     
 Come on. Let's play another one.     
 MARYBETH: Oh.     
 Oh, Sheriff, thank God.     
 - You her secretary? 
- Yes.     
 - This her car? 
- Yes.     
 She didn't show up for her conference call today, and she never misses a call.     
 Her phone keeps going to voice mail.     
 I came here to find her, and I found this.     
 (Marybeth groans)     
 - (Marybeth sighs) 
- You the night manager?     
 Yeah.     
 - You see her return last night? 
- Nah.     
 Few days ago.     
 Uh-huh. She go straight to her room?     
 Went to the bar, I think.     
 Hmm. Bartender in yet?     
 MAN:  Didn't see her last night,  but she was here every other night.     
 Always one glass of Merlot.     
 Nice-looking chick, but tough, with a capital "T."     
 - How's that? 
- I tried chatting her up, but she was having none of it, always scrolling on her phone. 
High-strung.     
 - Know what I mean? 
- Okay, let's...     
 Oh, and a bad tipper. Always only leaves change.     
 Listen, I'm gonna need you to focus, okay?     
 She ever drink here with anyone else? -(sighs)     
 Only other night was two nights ago.     
 She was talking to some dude.     
 Hipster beard.     
 - Really? 
- You know, the hippy-dippy type, tree hugger.     
 Hey, listen, you think you could describe this guy?     
 I mean, could you describe him to a sketch artist?     
 Yeah, no problem, Sheriff.     
 HAYLIE: Six years ago, this town in West Virginia sued One Planet.     
 Their water was tainted, and they thought it was because we were dumping coal waste into it.     
 But it turned out it was cyanobacteria from algae.     
 You think... that this spring was poisoned by nature?     
 I'm just saying it doesn't prove anything.     
 You know, before your company came, it was always clean.     
 Did you see anyone poison it?     
 We did not do it ourselves.     
 Come on, keep up.     
 Come on.     
 Was this done by nature?     
 I'm sure there's an explanation.     
 We have chemists.     
 They can look into it.     
 (chuckles)     
 Your plane draped all our fields in some kind of poison.     
 These were our most fertile plots on this mountain... now look.     
 Nothing grows here.     
 Those planes, did they have any markings or anything on them?     
 The powder burned my eyes.     
 I'm just now seeing clear again.     
 So can we agree they could have come from anyone, anywhere?     
 Who else besides your company wants us off this mountain with such fury?     
 One Planet would not starve you from your home.     
 That's not possible.     
 Oh, you're not just starving us.     
 You're killing us.     
 Bring her.     
 (chanting in native language)     
 (Emelye continues chanting)     
 A grieving circle.     
 Who died?     
 Silas Shay.     
 Only eight winters old.     
 (bird cawing in distance)     
 (birds chirping)     
 That's one of the coal devils... she needs to drink     
 - the water that killed Silas! 
- No, Eela, she needs to see     
 the grief her company has caused.     
 EELA: Who are you to take my boy?     
 He never had an unkind thought, never hurt a soul.     
 I hear you.     
 Eela!     
 (crying)     
 Oh, it's okay.     
 G'Winveer...     
 I promise you, as soon as I'm back down,     
 I'm gonna do everything in my power...     
 Take her.     
 (sobbing)     
 HAYLIE: Ow! Let me go!     
 Let go of me!     
 Oh, wait, hold on.     
 No, no, no! Come on!     
 I don't want... No!     
 - Get in there! 
- No! No!     
 (Haylie sobbing)     
 No!     
 G'Winveer, wait.     
 Wait.     
 What do you want from me?     
 Please, what can I do?     
 G'Winveer, come back!     
 - (door thumping) 
- G'Winveer!     
 You can't hide this child no more.     
 (Big Foster exhales)     
 Unless there's some kind of miracle... it can't be mine.     
 Is it Asa's?     
 Lil Foster's?     
 Somebody else's?     
 It ain't Asa's.     
 And there weren't nobody else.     
 So it's my boy's.     
 This is  my  child, Foster. Mine.     
 It is my responsibility, mine alone.     
 And I am gonna carry it careful, bring it into this world healthy and strong.     
 I already lost one child; I'm not gonna lose another.     
 No, I know. I know.     
 Whether you like it or not, we are married.     
 And I will be this child's father.     
 You really believe that?     
 You really think you have a right or claim on this child?     
 (sighs) Look, I know, I  know  there ain't nothin'... that I can say to you that's gonna make you believe that I can raise this child up right with you.     
 So I'm gonna have to show you.     
 And I will.     
 You want to show me you can be a Fa, then be one to your son.     
 Hasil, you here?     
 Hasil?     
 "Me and Hasil went out.     
 Won't be late. I think. Butch."     
 Hmm.     
 Hey, Frida.     
 (crowd shouting, loud music playing)     
 MAN: Step back, little boy.     
 (man grunts)     
 Hey. Hey. H-How, uh... how was your job interview?     
 Not good, Hasil.     
 And then I find out about this?     
 - Why'd you lie to me? 
- Sally-Ann,     
 I can't let you burden yourself being the only one putting paper down for us.     
 Look, every Farrell man does his part raising his child.     
 Let me do mine.     
 Now, if there's something else that I can do down here,     
 I would, but for now, this is it.     
 - Okay. 
- Okay.     
 - Then we do this my way? 
- Yeah.     
 - Keep you from getting caught. 
- Yeah, all right.     
 Okay. -All right, look, look, if you guys are worried about the po-po,     
 I'm clocking that door all night, okay?     
 And what about all the doors I saw coming in?     
 You know people here... get some of them to watch every one of them.     
 We're gonna have to pay 'em.     
 You're  gonna have to 'em,     
 'cause it's coming out of your cut.     
 - That's just crazy talk. I'm... 
- And no selling pot.     
 N-No, no, no way, no how I'm letting this happen, okay?     
 Okay.     
 Let's go.     
 Let's go. Come on, we're going.     
 Wait, wait, wait, h-hold on, hold on, hold on.     
 Please. I promise I won't sell anything, but you got to pay for half the look-outs.     
 Now, that's fair.     
 Come on, we got a deal?     
 Well, all right.     
 Now go win.

 I ain't got a place in that family no more.     
 You want to start a new one, then?     
 Let me bear another one of your children.     
 What are you talking about?     
 Another?     
 Uh, I thought you knew.     
 Knew what?     
 - Knew what? 
- G'Win.     
 Hey.     
 Hi.     
 Hey, hi, there.     
 Hey, what are y'alls names?     
 My name's Haylie.     
 You like this?     
 You like that? That's called a watch.     
 I tell you what.     
 I will trade you my watch for those berries.     
 Huh?     
 (children giggling)     
 Mmm.     
 (indistinct speaking nearby)     
 - Hey. 
- Hey.     
 (Ledda chuckles)     
 Did you meet that woman last night?     
 (chuckling): Did I meet that woman last night?     
 Why are you asking me that?     
 'Cause you're smiling.     
 Well, uh, maybe I'm smiling     
 'cause your mom's feeling better,     
 - did you think about that? 
- LEDDA: All right, go.     
 Get your bags, five minutes, meet me at the car.     
 Hup!     
 Didn't hear you come in till morning. How'd it go?     
 Um, yeah. It was fine.     
 - It was fine? 
- Yeah, it was fine.     
 (children laughing in distance)     
 Hey, uh, listen, I've been meaning to ask you.     
 You know anything about that guy who threw coal dust on Haylie Grimes?     
 Hmm. Why would I?     
 Well, 'cause he's a part of your protest.     
 What's this about?     
 Haylie Grimes has gone missing.     
 It looks suspicious.     
 We think she might have been kidnapped.     
 Recognize this fella?     
 Sheriff's department. Open up.     
 (door opening)     
 Gordon Jerrod?     
 Uh, yeah. Can I help you?     
 JERROD:  I don't know where she could have gone.   
 Yeah. How do you know her?     
 I went to her office to apologize for the coal dust.     
 You see her any other time?     
 I mean, I met her at her hotel's bar.     
 Oh.     
 And spent the night, but just the one night.     
 - I haven't seen her since. 
- Did she mention anything about taking a trip, going on a holiday?     
 Not to me. I mean, she said her company moves her around a lot, though. 
Did you check with them?     
 Yeah. Only, you know, they wouldn't have left her bag in her car, with the door open and her shoes lying in the parking lot.     
 I mean, if anyone had a reason to grab her it's gonna be a sh1t like you.     
 I didn't kidnap her.     
 Look, I was with a friend last night.     
 I met her coming outside of Tiny's.     
 She was with her friends, they're witnesses.     
 - Call them. 
- Okay.     
 What's your friend's name?     
 Chrissey Kormos.     
 Chris Kormos, like the waitress from Silviano's?     
 Yeah.     
 Man.     
 You're working your way through all the women in the county.     
 Now, you want to be pretty careful with that.     
 There's a lot of vulnerable people around.     
 You know, you don't want to go using them up, and then tossing them away like a dirty old towel.     
 Widows and such.     
 I'll give Chrissey a call.     
 Hey, uh...     
 You didn't, uh...     
 I mean, you don't know a woman by the name of Dana Miller, do you?     
 No.     
 Oh, good.     
 Did he do it?     
 Sheriff, I'm just concerned about Haylie.     
 Please, don't make me beg.     
 Oh. I'd like to see that.     
 No. I think he's got a pretty good alibi.     
 He just met up with Haylie a couple of times.     
 - Couple of times where? 
- Like, uh, at her office,     
 - uh, bar. 
- Her office? Really?     
 (animal howling in distance)     
 - (people clamoring in distance) 
- (owl hoots)     
 (indistinct chatter)     
 SHURN: Eela, come forward.     
 Eela, I'm so, so sorry about your son.     
 I have a little boy about that same age. -Hold her!     
 (gasps)     
 - No! No! 
- Get her!     
 No! No! Get away from me.     
 Get away! Get away!     
 Stay away from me. Stay away from me!     
 (yelling)     
 - (others shouting) 
- No! Stay away from me!     
 Stay away! Aah!     
 (Haylie sobbing)     
 Open her mouth!     
 (screams)     
 Pour!     
 (others continue shouting)     
 - Hold her mouth open! 
- MAN: Yeah-heh-heh!     
 (screaming)     
 - Pour it! 
- Stop!     
 - (crowd quiets) 
- Stop this!     
 (sobbing)     
 Eela, I feel your sorrow, but do not let your grief fuel your rage.     
 - EELA: She deserves to die. 
- No, don't do this!     
 Do you remember our troubles the last time an outsider was killed up here?     
 Do you want those troubles to come back?     
 Because they will... and in greater numbers.     
 And then it won't just be Silas, but all our chilluns who have to suffer.     
 (owl hooting)     
 (shuddering breaths)     
 (animal chitters in distance)     
 (frog croaking)     
 Release her.     
 Go on.     
 Many sorrys for my people's behavior.     
 You should never have suffered that attack; it's not our way.     
 Farrell Wine?     
 Our tradition has it that when one wishes to speak to another, hash out differences...     
 (laughs) You really think I'm gonna drink with you?     
 Please.     
 Hell, that's like drinkin' silk.     
 What is that?     
 - Are you giving me champagne? 
- We're celebrating.     
 Couldn't do it last night... you were... occupied.     
 To hope.     
 Is this sparkling cider?     
 (chuckles) Yeah, mine's the hard stuff.     
 Oh, well, thank you for that, but, um, I had a beer last night, actually.     
 I'm fine.     
 Listen...     
 I'm sorry I didn't say anything about Gordon earlier.     
 Did he do it?     
 No. No. No, he didn't.     
 His alibi cleared.     
 (sighing)     
 Handsome fella.     
 Yes, it was him, Wade.     
 Well, I kind of figured as much.     
 Think Breece would've minded?     
 No. I think that Breece would want me to live life and have some fun.     
 You really think that?     
 (chuckling): Hell, no.     
 (sighs) No. I think that Breece would want me to brood every day, and never be with another man the rest of my life.     
 I love him.     
 And I miss him.     
 But we can't... stop...     
 Look, we got to keep going.     
 And sometimes... you got to be a little bit selfish.     
 Mm.     
 Well, I'm glad you're sticking around.     
 He's handsome.     
 Yeah, he lives with his daddy.     
 We got divorced, and I gave him custody.     
 They're way out in Texas.     
 (sighs)     
 I haven't seen Sean...     
 (owl hooting)     
 One Planet bounces me around all over the place wherever the hell they need me.     
 You let them keep you from your home?     
 You've never lived off this mountain, have you?     
 And your company's not gonna change that.     
 Can I just tell you... a itty-bitty little secret?     
 You can't win.     
 You just, you can't.     
 They're too strong.     
 You sorely underestimate us.     
 They're not gonna stop.     
 They are gonna scoop out every scrap of coal on this mountain until all of this is flat.     
 We've endured greater threats than One Planet.     
 The Farrells have been on this mountain for over     years.     
 We've outlasted coal companies, loggers, harsh winters, families killing families, a war 'tween the states.     
 We are not gonna give up this fight.
