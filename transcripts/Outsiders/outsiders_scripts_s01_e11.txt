 Help! 
 I found him! 
 Big Foster... all he knows is intimidation, violence. 
 And that is why I'm getting the guns. 
 You wanna purchase more firearms, bring me cash. 
 You guys looking for some shine? 
 Stop doing business with the Farrells. 
 Aah! 
 [Alarm rings, glass shatters] 
 Oh, uh, Breece Dobbs. He was the other one. 
 Whatever you're doing, it's not gonna end well. All right? 
 You gotta think about your family. 
 Fella just came in, posted his bail. 
 Seen Pat or Jake? 
 They got them a bunch of kerosene. 
 Sacred land, my ass. 
 Sacred land! Come on! 
 Ged-gedyah! Ged-gedyah! 
 [Engine revs] 
 You okay, Bren'in? 
 Nervous about the wedding? 
 You're not gonna go through with the marriage, right? 
 The decision's been made, Asa, and it's real. 
 Unlike the pretending that you and I have been doing. 
 I have not been pretending. Not for one second. 
 Tomorrow, just before he's taking his vows, I'm gonna kill him. 
 There are trying times ahead, and we need a Bren'in who cares more about his people than he does about himself. 
 Asa, stop it! 
 Caught one up. 
 Please, on the lives of my kids, you'll never see me again! 
 Guaranteed, I won't see you again. 
 [Gunshot] 
 [Gasps] 
 Don't nobody here say that this Bren'in don't protect this clan.

 Yeah. Yeah, just one sec.

 Here. 
 I think I'm gonna sell the house. 
 Why? 
 Because it's old. 
 I thought I could maybe get somewhere closer to you and the girls. 
 You know, I mean, if you want to, you can come and stay there with us, or we can come stay here. 
 Thanks, Wade. 
 I know you tried to get through to me. 
 I do thank you for it and... 
 Sure, Wade. 
 I'm gonna find the guy who did it. 
 And I'm gonna do what I can. 
 Oh, so, you're gonna do your job now, all of a sudden? 
 Now that my Dad is dead. 
 Hey, hey, hey, hilda. 
 Thanks a lot. 
 No, let her, no... you do not talk to your uncle that way. 
 Hilda, no. You're allowed to talk to me that way. 
 You can say whatever you like. 
 If you're angry, you be angry. Don't sit on it. 
 Okay, it's not his fault. 
 Don't bottle it up. 
 And you're right. Hilda. 
 You're right. I could've done something sooner. 
 Come here. 
 If you want to be angry, you can be angry, okay? 
 [Crying] Come here, honey? 
 She's fine. 
 Hey, you're okay. It's all right. 
 It's okay. Okay? 
 What's the matter? You're okay. 
 Uh, Wade? 
 [Dog barking in distance] 
 That was the M.E. 
 The bullet they found in him, it's from a Smith & Wesson, model 10, 1920s issue. 
 Same spec we recovered from the gun store robbery. 
 What? 
 [Door closes] 
 It was a Farrell that killed Breece. 
 I'm gonna do anything about this, I need to know what you know, so... 
 Did he say anything to you? 
 I mean, did he tell you why he was getting together with those guys? 
 I mean, did they say anything about why they busted up that store? 
 Yeah, he said something about Moonshine. 
 He said that they thought that guy Donnie... 
 Was selling Moonshine for the Farrells. 
 That's what he said.

 Yeah, it's kind of hard to miss, ain't it? 
 Sounds like they're working double time. 
 Sounds like the clock is ticking away, and here you are fiddling with your toenails. 
 I have a plan, Foster. 
 You know, good things don't happen overnight. 
 Oh, but they can... As in now. 
 I'm getting your point here. 
 Maybe I should go check in, see how things are doing down in Hades. 
 You wanna join me? 
 Things don't always go so well for me down there. 
 They're gonna be looking for me. 
 It's not like I got a big edge on you, but, um, maybe I could put a little pressure on my sales agent. 
 You do that. 
 Yeah. 
 [Spits] This is your last chance to get this right. 
 I'll make sure I do the best I can for you.

 Uh, and you all come see me the minute you get back, right? 
 All right. [Coughing]

 Why are we just sitting here? 
 Shouldn't we go talk to Donnie about it? 
 I mean, we can't go search the place without a warrant. 
 There was a Farrell selling shine down here a while ago. 
 I just don't think he's the murdering kind. 
 Why not? 
 He was wearing a skirt. 
 I mean, for one thing, I mean. 
 Kilt. I mean, not that it matters anyway. 
 That's the one I tased. 
 Yeah. 
 Yeah, right. 
 There's another one I came across that... somethin' sick about him, like a wounded animal. 
 Nothing good about him.

 I'll bring weapons and ammunition late tonight or tomorrow morning. 
 Now while G'winveer's going about her daily tasks at the planthouse, I'll lie in wait for Foster to go on his morning hunt, and then I'll kill him. 
 What if he don't go for a hunt? 
 Well, in that case, we have enough arms to overpower his sentries. 
 If we all do it together. 
 I ain't never shot no gun. Don't even know if I can. 
 I'll show you, Krake. I'll show all of you. 
 Then we're gonna surround 'em and we're gonna kill 'em. 
 We're gonna surround his guards and just start shooting our own? 
 That doesn't sound perfectly thought through, Asa. 
 I know there are risks involved. 
 So if any of y'all wanna step away, now would be the time. 
 I ain't gonna judge you. 
 You won't judge  us? 
 You brought my boy's body back from the lowlands. 
 And I will always be grateful for that. 
 But we formed this group and brought you in. 
 We're of equals here. That's our way. 
 Only now you're the one telling us the plan and making up the story. 
 When did that happen? 
 I am the one returned. 
 The prophecy of lady Ray told it so.
