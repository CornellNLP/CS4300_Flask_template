 Mine, I got a right to take. 
 [Grunts] 
 I am the one now. 
 Me and Lil Foster are not married, like I said. 
 There's some things I need to say to you, G'win. 
 Maybe it's time you go be with him again. 
 Yeah, now that the mining permit's finally gone through, we need them off our land, and now. 
 Sally-Ann, you wanna do somethin'? 
 You got any money? 
 That's the best batch of Farrell wine ever, if I do say so myself. 
 How much? 
 [Chanting] Chug! Chug! Chug! 
 Have you been drinking? 
 [Vomits] 
 Tyler. [Grunting] 
 What if it wasn't just Moonshine? 
 Maybe the Farrells are cooking something nasty up there. 
 And if that were true, not too many folks around here would oppose your eviction of them. 
 I need you to find me that shine he drunk. 
 I so much as hear you breathed a word to one of them again, and I bust your ass.

You take one shot at them, and they will come at us with everything they got. Good. Then they'll know a Farrell don't run. [Police radio chatter] Miss... Listen, we can keep doing this all day, Jane... or whatever you're calling yourself these days. What do you want? Well, you know what I want. I gotta get you to move on out of here or I'm taking you with me, and that's your choice. Uh, really, chief? You know times are so tough. This little itty bitty strip here is all I got. You know? You feel me? You know this is my job, and that's all I got, too. So I gotta... I gotta do what I gotta do. Okay, then you just go and you take me in, Sheriff. There's nothing I can say about it. Ma'am, I'm gonna ask you to take your hands out of there. Mm-hmm. I'm just looking for my I.D. You know, so you can go on and... and... and book me, you know? Oh... oh... oh... there it is. Look there. Got my name on it. You think you're being goddamn funny? Well, I don't know, Sheriff. You do seem a little tense, you know? Well, you keep sassing me, ma'am, you're gonna see me tense. Hey. Hey, I'm talking to you. You come back here right now! They're blowing up that whole Ridge. That means half our water goes bad. As I said, it ain't gonna happen. Bhradain, go around to Morningside and you tell the McGintuk boys what transpired. They probably heard nothing over there. Let's see how much fire you can get from them. Yes, sir. It's done. No, Foster, that's a mistake. You know it is. Last time they started on that road, what happened? [Chuckles] You weren't even born yet. No, but I heard the story since I was a girl. Two of our people got shot by the police. One of them was your fa. He was our Bren'in. And what happened after that? Huh? What come up that road? I'll tell you. Nobody, 'cause they stopped cutting it. They went away, and that is what happened. Well, it was too high a price. Foster, hear me out, please. Look, I remember your fa. I was 4 years old when he died. The man was a giant. Now I honor his legend, but... [sighs] We can't fight them like we used to. That's what they're hoping we do. We shoot first, give them the right to come at us with an army. And if we do that... you listen to me, lostie. This mountain is ours, but it don't come free. We gotta pay rent on it like anybody. Only our rent, it come in blood. Bhradain, go. And the rest of you, you come with me. You know, if it weren't for you, we wouldn't have known any of this was coming down, Asa. You're the only one of us that knows them. Suppose you head back down there and straighten this out. They ain't gonna listen to me. sh1t. You just gonna sit there? [School bell rings] Hey, how's school today? You okay? I gotta take you to your, um, Aunt Ledda's house, okay? What's that? Hey. What's that on your face? What did someone do? You get scratched? Hey, you get in a fight? No. You hit him back? I didn't get in a fight. [Clicks tongue] Know something? I don't know what to say to you. You already said it without saying it's what I'd say. I cannot go back down there, G'win, and you know it. Do I? What, you think I spent six months in that box because, what, I was enjoying myself? Because I didn't care one way or the other? Huh? No. It's got to be some other thing, something else. I wanna be here with you, with all of us. That's it. That's the reason. You're a goddamn liar. How come you never got married to him? You know, you belong down there with them fakers, you pile of pig sh1t. Go on! Run away. That's exactly what I'm not doing. Horses. You're running even when you're standing still. Okay. Oh, that was too easy. Oh, no, keep walking, Asa Farrell. You ran away and left me 10 years ago. You think you can just come back, do your time, win a pitfight, and we all welcome you back like some kind of hero? I said I was sorry. You did? I must've missed it. Okay. I'm saying I'm sorry now. Whatever it is that you think that we have up here, it's going away and soon. Okay, then... What should I do? Show them who we are. [Hammer clicks] So we got five pistols, three new shotguns, plus the springfields and the rifle we got the other night. Mm. [Gun clicks] Four pistols. [Gun thuds] We need repeaters is what we need. Automatics. Make that eight pistols, fa. I got four more good .44s from down in Shaytown. [Guns clatter] Then there's this... Revenuers' fire from back in prohibition days. It work? Think so. Oh, you think so. You got rounds for it? Yep. That it? And you don't know if it shoots or not. I-I didn't want to waste any of the rounds on... Well, what you're wasting is my time. You see a sign on the door, say we need girl chilluns in here? You told us to get all that we could. I-I just... you just what? Didn't I tell you not ever show your face around here again? Why you no listen to anything I say to you? I, uh, I know a fella that's got some good longbows. I'll go get them. Come on. Come on. Fa, please... don't you ever call me that again. He didn't win fair. Oh, you lost. And that's what I know. That's what everybody knows. Well, let me prove it to you. Look, I believed you before, and that was the last time. You want to come back here again? Then you do something right for me, for this family. [Door opens, slams] [Distant bird cawing] [Door bell chimes] [Register beeps] $4.99. Thank you. Have a nice day. You, too. Hello. Hello. [Whispers] Apple. [Music playing softly on speakers] [Sighs] Sorry. Look here. 4-8-8-8-8-2-9. Okay? Awesome. Got it, thank you. That'll be $3.69. Thank you. [Door bell chimes] Here you are. Have a nice day. ♪ Mr. Rourke? [TV playing indistinctly] Mr. Rourke, it's me, Asa. I saw the newspaper was closed. What happened? [Sports broadcast playing on TV indistinctly] Mr. Rourke? Finally. [Chuckles] I don't know what took so long. Well, I was away out west. Hot diggity damn. Now that's what I call interesting. [Chuckles] You go from one to zero, and then back again, and what do you got? Mr. Rourke. Mr. Rourke, you okay? Your word is your wand. Isn't that right? Woman on TV:  ♪ and the rockets red glare ♪ Yeah, that's right, Mr. Rourke. ♪ Bombs bursting in air ♪ 
♪ gave proof through the night ♪ 
♪ that our flag was still there ♪ 
 
 I think we might have got them. Good job, right? Sheriff Houghton, good to see you. Ms. Bryant. Oh, please. Claire. Um... I couldn't help noticing yesterday, I came in to pick up Caleb, and, um, he had big scratches on his face. I saw those, too, yeah. I just wanted to know what happened to him. Well, he said he fell in the woods. You let him go in the woods? No, no, no, we don't do that. Ah. Hmm. Well... He came to school with the scratches on his face. Technically, I see a child come in looking like that, I'm supposed to pick up the phone, but... I assumed you already knew about it. Yeah. Uh, where are you from? You from Boston? D.C.? Hartford. Hartford. Um, well, we're sure very lucky to have you here. My little boy's... he's all there is. [Indistinct conversations] Good evening, everybody. Welcome to our hearing. I'm Sheriff Tom Weineke, as most of you know. Uh, it's good to see such nice turnout. [Chuckles] So, um, as y'all know, the extraction permit for Shay Mountain finally went through. Tonight we'll be hearing arguments, pro and con, concerning the relocation of the homesteader family we call the Farrells. Ms. Haylie Grimes of one planet resources. Thank you, Sheriff. My name is Haylie Grimes, and I'm the new community relations manager. And I'm just thrilled to be a part of this effort to create jobs and revitalize this town. Our Shay Mountain extraction project will bring hundreds of jobs here and really get this town back on its feet. But we can't do that until the people who are illegally squatting on our land have been relocated to more suitable housing. [Crowd murmuring] I know these are difficult times, but the state has told us that until they're gone, we can't begin work, meaning the start date for hiring full-time positions has been pushed. Pushed till when? Until all those people have been moved. And how long's that gonna take? That's up to the county sheriff's department. To hell with them Farrells! They've been here a lot longer than your family! Shut up about my family, Sue! Just 'cause you married one of them. [Laughter] All right. All right. Now, everybody quiet down. Leave 'em alone! Just... just... just quiet down. [Pounding on door] Hey, Butch, I know you're in there! Come on, open the door! [Turns off TV] [Pounding continues] Butch, I know you're in there! Come on, I just want to talk to you. [Pounding continues] I mean what I say, Butch. Open the goddamn door. All right, all right, I'm coming. Hey. [Laughs] I'm sorry. Sorry to bother you, brother. Um... Hello, ma'am... Sir. Um, look, I need the rest of that cash and I'm gonna need it now. You need something, you might want to try a friendlier approach. Just saying. I ain't got your money, son. I'm laying low as it is 'cause of you. What you talking about 'cause of me? Come on, 'cause of me? Look, I'm the one that's got trouble, not y'all. Well, word is your shine caused some kid to kill his dad. Now he's locked up. And he was one of my best customers. Okay, listen. I need that money to go on a date. [Scoffs] [Laughs] All right, I need it to go on a date. I got a girl. She likes to be treated special. You understand? Hey. Yeah. [Rustling] Hey! Don't just sit there. Oh, look at that. Look at this. You still owe me half for this one, too. Well, then go on and take it! Listen to me. Hey, ease up! [Grunts] [Whispers] Listen. Listen. I want that paper, Butch. I told you, I ain't got it. Uhh! I told you I want that paper, Butch! Hey! Hey! I told you. Go! Here! Get the hell out of here! Go! [Door opens and closes] [Animal howls] What are you looking for? I found it. Bhradain's got a leaky roof. I'm gonna go help him fix it. Only reason you're saying that is 'cause you want me to know you're lying. Where are you going? Nowhere. Here. I don't need that. Don't your fa want all the fire he can get? Make a big show down the end of the road? Get us all killed? I don't know what you're talking about. Foster. All that dancing, with him, don't mean nothing. Just idle talk without the talk. That's right. Hmm. Listen... I know you a long time. I know how your head works... And  elsewhere. So I know you plan on dusting his broom, if you haven't already. I'm just asking if you love me the way that you say you do... And I'm asking you to think about whose side you're on... your fa's or ours. [Applause] Hey, y'all, um, I'm Ledda Dobbs, and, uh, as y'all probably know, um, my husband, Breece, is a miner. And he's out of work. Look. I'm all for jobs. I am. But these mountains, they... they don't belong to us. They belong to god. And... and we've got no right to blow them up. I need a job! Now, they say they're... they're gonna create hundreds of positions. But if you ask any of those people... [Crowd murmuring] ... Over in Kenlayson or Juviler, where they... they wrecked their water and... and they filled the air with coal dust and the hollows with black sludge. [Murmuring intensifies] They will tell you that most of the jobs that they're creating are overseas. That is not true. It is true. And once they're done polluting our towns and our schools, they'll take their Billions and they'll just go back home and they'll leave us with our ill health and... and our... and our streams with no fish in them and nowhere for our kids to play. So, listen, I-I just... I say leave them Farrells be... [scattered booing] .. and more importantly, you let that mountain be. [Scattered applause, indistinct shouting] My name is Breece Dobbs. [Chuckles] Ledda's my wife. We agree on some things, and we disagree on others. Where we agree, we both want to raise our girls right and give them a future. But we can't do that without work. [Crowd affirming] I come off from my second tour of Iraq and I worked steady, but I ain't had a job in near three years now. That's tough. And that's hard. Um, but now there's hope for me and my family and all the families represented here tonight 'cause... that's right! You said it, brother! [Applause] These good people here, they come here and they offer us jobs so we can hold our heads up high. You know, bring this town back from the brink a little bit. [Applause] Them Farrells, they don't own that land they live on. They got no right to be up there. They don't pay taxes on it. They don't put their kids in our schools. That's right. They don't abide by our laws. So I just got to wonder why... [Applause, cheering] Breece! Why we gotta play by the rules, and them Farrells don't. Thank you very much. All right, Breece! [Chanting] Breece! Breece! [Cheers and applause] Breece! Breece! Breece! All right, just quiet down, everybody. Quiet down. Oh, say, can you see... By the Dawn's early light, when so loudly we caved at the fat cat's last scheming? Whose jail stripes and strip bars through the pale urban blight, and all those poor folks we squashed were so gallantly screaming. And the deep pockets did stare, aplomb nursing the dare, and if you ain't rich like me, then your rights are stripped bare. Oh, say, does that far-fangled banner ad deprave o'er the home of pure greed and the land of the slave? Any of you come up that mountain, you ain't gonna be coming back down. Thank you. [Microphone clatters] Hey, you threatening us?! [Indistinct shouting] Huh?! Get back here, Farrell! You get your butt back here! I'm gonna get you! Stop. Get out of the way, Wade! Get out of the way! Where you going? [Indistinct shouting] Costing us money, telling us what to do? Those Farrells! Police are on the way, just so you know. I ain't doing nothing. I'm just waiting for somebody. Yeah, well, you're scaring people off. [Siren whoops] Don't say I didn't warn you. How's it going tonight? Well, it's, uh, it's going pretty good. He says he's waiting for somebody. What's your name? [Scoffs] Look, don't a fella have the right to sit outside and look at the stars, look at the moon in peace? Well, this is private property, so, uh, why don't you go on across the street over there? Why don't  you  mind your own affairs, sir? Come on. Let's go. Let's move it along. Come on. What, you gonna shoot me? [Baton clicks] [Laughs] Let's go. Come on, let's go. I said let's go. Car 4 at the acorn's on Chapel Street. I need some backup. sh1t. [Baton clatters] You are under arrest. [Laughs] Stop right there. I said stop! I said stop. [Taser clicking] [Grunts] You think that guy was one of them? Or one of those crazy-ass tree hugger kids? [Can pops] I don't know. Couldn't tell what he was. He was one of what? What happened? Where's Caleb? Is he... he sleeping? I guess so. We think there was a Farrell at the town meeting tonight. Damn weirdo is what he was. He was pretty smart for one of them. Mr. Grant told us in history class that they have what's called squatter's rights. Said we tried to kick them out a long time ago, but two people died. It wasn't that long ago. Your uncle and I were like Caleb's age. It wasn't two people that died neither, sweetie. There were three. [Sighs] Man, he's out like a light. Well, he can stay here tonight then. Just like every night. Hey. Uncle Wade, are you gonna kick the Farrells off their land? Uh, well, evicting them is... one, it's not their land. And two, if you were doing your job, we'd all be a lot better off by now. Breece, what do you want me to do? I want you to do something, anything. What do you want me... do you want me to go up there? That's what cops do. I-I got a little boy, Breece. I got two little girls. Yeah, and what do you think's gonna happen to them? [Clearing throat] What's gonna happen to the whole goddamn town? Excuse me, Ledda. The whole goddamn town has been in the shitter for 10 years, so... You know what, Breece? You're like a goddamn broken record, man. Hey, I'll be a goddamn broken record all I want in my own house. You understand, Wade? You know there's a precedent. Okay. Okay. That is enough, both of you. [Cell phone rings] [Ring, beep] Yeah? What in god's name did you tase him for?! [Cell phone snaps shut] ♪ ♪ Where is he? Uh, he won't tell us his name. And of course, he don't have an I.D. Uh, there's a jug of shine in his bag. You want me to hold it? No. Fill out a form for a John Doe. I'll take care of this. Hey, do I get a, uh, what do y'all call it? A-a barrister? Don't y'all never come down here again! You hear me?! Uhh. You tell your folks, you stay up there. You don't cause no trouble. I'm trying to make all this go away. Now you got to work with me. What'd I say to you? You said good night and sweet dreams. What you said. Breece, why do you have to give him such a hard time like that? 'Cause he's a drunk. Look, I know that you're on that line every morning, looking for day work, but that is not Wade's fault. His job is to get them down off of there. And he don't seem too motivated. Did you see the way he defended that guy? You don't remember that there's a reason for that? Farrells didn't kill your daddy. Booze and pills killed your daddy, same as it's killing him. [Crickets chirping] There he is up there! [Tires screeching] [Indistinct shouting] Hey, Farrell! Well, well, look who it is. You need a ride, Mr. Smart-ass? No, thanks. I'm good. What, you just gonna walk back up that hill? I done it before. Not tonight. Look, guys, you really don't want to do this. [Chuckles] [Grunting] Hey, hey, hey! Come on! Get him, Jake! Hey, Farrell, we got a message for you. [Groans] Something you can take to your kin. [Grunts] [Laughs] Yeah! Whoo! Come on! Do it! Do it! Aah! You wanna send me a message? Huh? Huh?! Get back! You want to send me a message?! Aah! There's my message. Leave us Farrells alone. [Crowbar clanks] [Panting] Jake. Come on, come on. Get him up. Yeah, come on. Damn! [TV playing indistinctly] [Exhales] [Gun cocks] Don't you move, boy, unless you want to die. I don't want no trouble now. You hear me? You killed my baby brother. What are you talking about? That night we all came down here. He was only 8 years old. Well, I'm sorry about that. But we have a right to defend ourselves from y'all. Git! [Gunshot] [Groaning] [Gasping] [Strained voice] Help me. [Groans, mutters] [Gasping] [Breathing stops] [Coughs] How'd it go down there? Not too good from the looks of it. [Laughs] I told you, boy, this is a job for the loyal and the true, not a child who doesn't know who he is yet. I tried. [Breathing heavily] And? We're in a war, G'win. Looks like we're losing already. [Exhales sharply] [Gasps] I know you're not married, but I... but what? You've been away too long. You've forgotten how we do things up here. ♪ Hey, fa, you home? ♪
