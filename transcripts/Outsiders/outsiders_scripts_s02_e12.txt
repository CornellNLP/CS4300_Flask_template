 Previously on  Outsiders...   
 What's that?   
 The end of your career.   
 G'WIN: We're going on this run.   
 We're only gonna take back what's owed us,   
 water and flour, that's all.   
 - What are you doing here? 
- They dropped poison from the air above onto our fields.   
 - Yeah, Houghton, go ahead. 
- DISPATCH: Armed robbery    
 - in progress. 
- It's your people, isn't it?    
 Put your hands up, Farrells.    
 (gunshots)    
 (grunts)    
 SALLY-ANN:  Was counting the money from the fight  last night and something ain't right.    
 Butch is out, and I'm handling Hasil's stuff from now on.    
 Saw him today, man who killed Breece.    
 You're under arrest for the murder of Breece Dobbs.    
 Could've shot him dead right there.    
 - But you didn't. 
- Drop your gun, Wade!    
 BIG FOSTER: I'm walking away now, Sheriff.    
 (engine revs)    
 MEYERS:  Those samples, they're only gonna prove you wrong.   
 HAYLIE:  When those results come back,   
 you're gonna be going to jail.   
 I tried.    
 - (phone rings) 
- Yeah?    
 Elon?    
 (breathing heavily)    
 Elon!    
 (engine running, then sputtering)    
 (panting)    
 It's dead.    
 Looks like we're walking.    
 (panting)    
 You all right?    
 Yeah. (spits)    
 We should get moving.

 Now, the ligature marks on the neck    
 are consistent with the, uh, bathrobe    
 that was removed from the scene.    
 Petechiae on the forehead and under the eyelids, congestion.    
 Her arms and legs are scratched up pretty good, too,    
 but, uh, that occurred prior to the time of death.    
 It's, uh... it's pretty straightforward.    
 She just hung herself in her hotel bathroom?    
 Yeah, it looks that way.    
 I haven't finished my full exam, but so far,    
 I see nothing to suggest anything other than suicide.    
 I don't get it.    
 I mean, I saw her two days before, and she told me    
 she never felt better.    
 Yeah, well, I guess, uh, "never better"    
 means something different to everybody, doesn't it?    
 (sighs)    
 (Houghton sighs)    
 Find anything?    
 Hell of a suicide note.    
 - HOUGHTON: That's it? 
- Yeah.    
 You find any of those, like, little Mason jars?    
 The type of things people drink shine from?    
 No, nothing like that.    
 Got her phone.    
 - It's got a lock on it? 
- Yeah.    
 (softly): Yeah. Just go.    
 MEYERS:  Haylie Grimes' death   
 was a shock to all of us.    
 She was as tough and dedicated as they come.    
 The situation in Blackburg was stressful, I'm sure,    
 but I understand that she was also    
 dealing with family issues...    
 Haylie was a friend, so, please, cut the bullshit.    
 WOMAN: Mr. Meyers, I think I speak for    
 both Don and the lieutenant governor when I say    
 there are some very real concerns about    
 how things have unfolded in Blackburg on your watch.    
 We got ourselves a goddamn train wreck down there, huh, Matt?    
 You know I love you, I know you, I respect you, but...    
 gee whiz, I've lost track    
 of the number of ways that you've dicked this thing up.    
 A $  million fence that couldn't keep a rabbit out,    
 thank God we dumped that.    
 Got a bunch of citizens scared out of their minds    
 by some outlaw hillbillies, running around,    
 doing whatever they damn well please    
 including breaking each other out of prison,    
 shooting an off-duty cop.     
 We're also concerned about the recent Internet security issues.     
 SHAW: Yeah, don't even get me started     
 on that Internet crap.     
 Holy Mary, Mother of God.     
 I mean, all these folks around here already think     
 that we're all in bed together,     
 they don't need to hear the springs squeaking.     
 May I speak?     
 I take full responsibility for the situation in Blackburg.     
 And I would like to tender my resignation,     
 effective immediately.     
 What?     
 You are now free     
 to send your guard units up Shay Mountain     
 and arrest and imprison every Farrell man, woman and child,     
 because they've made it clear they're not going     
 - without a fight. 
- Come on, Matt.     
 You know as well as I do     
 how that's gonna go over in the governor's office     
 with an election year coming around the corner.     
 Yes, I do.     
 Nobody wants the state of Kentucky up on that mountain.     
 Heck, half the county supports the Farrells,     
 they think they're the last free people in America.     
 I think it's time to request federal support.     
 Oh, come on, Matt, damn it,     
 you know that Washington does not have a dog in this fight.     
 Not yet.     
 But if I am somehow allowed to continue in my failure,     
 there is a plan in place that would force Washington's hand.     
 - Which is what, exactly? 
- Wait, whoa.     
 Son, you don't want to ask questions     
 you might not want the answer to.     
 So...     
 ...y-you have a plan.     
 I do.     
 PORTER: Eric Steven Thompson, not Gordon Jerrod, correct?     
 No?     
 How about Timothy Aldrich?     
 Wanted for bombing the offices of Heartland Energy,     
 Parmelee, South Dakota, May  ,     ?     
 Killed some poor schmuck, working overtime     
 chasing a promotion.     
 Look, if I'm being charged with something,     
 can you at least tell me what it is?     
 Yeah, that's not exactly our line of work.     
 But by all means, keep playing dumb.     
 Because the people who will charge you for murder,     
 among other things,     
 they're only a phone call away.     
 Or not.     
 All depends on your willingness to play ball.     
 Parmelee was a mistake.     
 That building was supposed to be empty.     
 PORTER: See? That wasn't so hard.     
 First step in coming to Jesus is to admit that you done wrong.     
 TECH: It's clean.     
 What do you want from me?     
 Making friends seems to be a talent of yours     
 and right now that's very valuable to me,     
 and to you, as it turns out.     
 PORTER: So, Gordo, what do you say?     
 Want to make some new friends?

 Hi.     
 (groans softly)     
 (gun cocks)     
 Beautiful day, isn't it?     
 BIG FOSTER: Well, well, well, well.     
 Lookie here.     
 You are a lost little lamb indeed, ain't you?     
 PHIL'UP: No, he's more wolf than lamb, if you ask me.     
 Seems he came up the morning side trails.     
 Oh.     
 You're intruding on Farrell land,     
 our land.     
 Now you're not from these parts, so we'll spare the mistake.     
 Once.     
 Oh, I'm not here by mistake.     
 My name is Gordon Jerrod.     
 And like you, I'm no friend of big coal.     
 In fact, I've been fighting them for years.     
 What's your purpose here?     
 To warn you.     
 You made yourself heard.     
 People know what One Planet is doing up here,     
 they're poisoning your food, your water,     
 and people are angry.     
 - Oh, well, then good. 
- GORDON: Yeah, it would be good,     
 - but then you shot a cop. 
- Oh, that ain't true.     
 We didn't shoot no one, especially not no cop.     
 Besides, we-we was shot at first.     
 Now, look, it's all the reason they needed.     
 A National Guard regiment arrived yesterday.     
 And One Planet is coming up here to end this once and for all.     
 You know that granite wall just south of here?     
 - Yeah, The Drop. 
- Yeah.     
 Well, they're gonna blow that all to hell.     
 A load of dynamite arrived yesterday.     
 The coal company is keeping it stored at a construction site,     
 just outside of town.     
 They're gonna carve a path for their troops,     
 their machines,     
 whatever they want.     
 How soon?     
 Soon.     
 "Soon," he says. What's that mean?     
 Two weeks? Two days?     
 If they blow up The Drop, what's to stop 'em?     
 Nothing. That's what.     
 - He's right. 
- PHIL'UP: I say we fight.     
 I was born on this mountain and I'll die on this mountain.     
 We can't take on no army.     
 Okay, we got old and young among us.     
 We've only got supplies to carry us through the winter,     
 not to take on a fight that we can't win.     
 LIL FOSTER: All right, but if he's telling the truth,     
 they got dynamite.     
 Maybe just go steal it. That'd buy us some time.     
 Go see if this lostie is telling the truth.     
 But don't take your eyes off him, not for a second.     
 - You understand? 
- BIG FOSTER: I understand.     
 Here.     
 See right there?     
 That green and red pod right there?     
 Inside there,     
     sticks,     gram cylinders,     
 Dyno Nobel, all top grade.     
 I have the code to unlock it.     
 We got to take out the security cameras,     
 we got to figure out what to do about the guards and their dogs.     
 And we got to do it soon.     
 Saturday night...     
 no workers, only two guards.     
 We ain't got to worry about them dogs.     
 Yeah, them guards ain't no concern, either.     
 Yeah, well, don't be so sure.     
 They brought in their own guys,     
 professional security contractors.     
 These aren't mall rent-a-cops.     
 Seems like you know all there is to know.     
 Well, I stole every secret they have.     
 Hmm. Well, maybe you got a secret or two of your own.     
 Hmm? Maybe at the end of this, the law will be waiting for us     
 down there and that's your plan?     
 That sound about right?     
 Look, if you don't trust me, that's fine.     
 That's your choice. But the fact is,     
 there's dynamite in there, and they're gonna use it.     
 LIL FOSTER: All right, listen to me, lowlander.     
 I'll die before I go back into one of their jail cells     
 and I'll take you with me. You understand that?     
 Yeah.

 (low rumbling)     
 (rattling)     
 (vehicles approaching)     
 Hasil, just come back.     
 (sighs) Get back here.     
 All this new law in town.     
 Just ain't no end to it.     
 I just can't figure it.     
 I mean, going on a run for flour and for water.     
 We do without plenty up on that mountain,     
 but the Farrells, they ain't ever lacked for food.     
 What do you think happened?     
 I don't know.     
 (sighs)     
 One thing's for sure.     
 We brought hellfire down on ourselves this time.     
 Well, then I guess we just got to stay in bed for a few days.     
 Mm.     
 Hey. What happens when we run out of money?     
 I mean, with all this law around,     
 how am I supposed to fight, smarty-pants?     
 That's for me to worry about.     
 - (scoffs) 
- I'm your manager now, remember?     
 Mm.     
 (vehicles approaching)     
 (helicopter blades whirring)     
 (door bells jingle)     
 - What's this? 
- An address.     
 One of the early draws cancelled.     
 You wanted your man in the major leagues, there you go.     
 Bigger crowds, bigger money.     
 Tennessee?     
 - Is that a problem? 
- No.     
 Hasil sure can't fight around here anymore.     
 sh1t, darling, nobody can.     
 There's a goddamn uniform on every corner.     
 (clears throat) That ought to be a good one, though.     
 Like I said, big leagues.     
 Look, these ain't no farm boys or barroom brawlers.     
 Your man best bring his "A" game,     
 or you best bring a shovel.     
 Did she seem, um, angry?     
 Um, more than usual? Depressed, anything like that?     
 Often, we find that the people     
 might be making some sort of final arrangements,     
 or maybe, uh, even saying good-bye,     
 but it might not have seemed like much at the time.     
 Uh, no. Nothing.     
 HOUGHTON: No? All right, well, it might be an idea     
 if I could have a look at her e-mails     
 - for the last couple of weeks. 
- May I ask why?     
 Um, yeah, I'm just checking off the boxes.     
 Has there been a crime committed?     
 Because we would require a warrant     
 for anything on a company server.     
 Yeah, okay. Um, I suppose     
 it'd be the same thing for a cell phone?     
 If it was one the company paid for, yes.     
 And again, unless there is reasonable suspicion     
 of wrongdoing,     
 not sure why that would be necessary.     
 Okay, well, uh... oh, I almost forgot.     
 Um, I need to ask you about those jars that she had.     
 - Jars? 
- You remember,     
 she came in the office,     
 she had those two old Mason jars with her?     
 I mean, we-we talked about it at the time.     
 Uh, honestly, Sheriff, I-I don't recall her having any jars.     
 I'm-I'm sorry.     
 Oh.

 Oh, no, what we get...

 It's not just the coal company that's after me.

 So what do you think about that?

 you would have never believed me about the dynamite.

 - Okay?

 I want to show you something.     
 Please.     
 See that?     
 That's what they want to do to your mountain.     
 All right?     
 And this is the equipment they're gonna use to do it.     
 Now, bringing this up here, it ain't gonna be cheap.     
 It's gonna cost them dearly.     
 But I say, let's make it cost more.     
 Let's not just steal the dynamite,     
 let's use it on that.     
 For a murderer,

 But I'm not gonna do that     
 because I want to take them down just as bad as you do.     
 So that was your plan the whole time.     
 Get us to help you and then leave us to suffer for it?     
 I need your help, yeah.     
 But it's them that's gonna suffer.

 No, they're coming, and they're coming hard.

 - PDPD for short. 
- HOUGHTON: Yeah, listen, it's been a while     
 since my last chemistry lesson, so what's that mean?     
 Basically, it's an enhanced version of Agent Orange.     
 What are you talking about, Agent Orange?     
 You mean like in Vietnam?     
 Yeah, except this stuff's been modified to absorb     
 through the plant root system     
 in addition to its defoliant properties,     
 and it'll stay active in soil for a decade.     
 - Are you serious? 
- Yeah.     
 It's nasty stuff. Where'd you get it?     
 It's a, uh, it's an open investigation.     
 Listen, I need you to send me these original samples     
 soon as you're done with them, okay?     
 And, uh, get me the lab results.     
 This dynamite... I know you think it foolish,     
 but it has to be done.     
 And I come to ask your blessing on it.     
 (scoffs) What for?     
 You're gonna steal it anyway, ain't that right?     
 If there is a path to glory paved with fury and strife,     
 you're bound to walk it, ain't you?     
 No, you're wrong.     
 Ain't none of this to glory myself.     
 This is for the future of this clan.     
 It's for you and me and all that's come to us.     
 Then you're wasting your time.     
 There ain't nothing left between us anymore, Foster,     
 - not a single thing. 
- What do you mean "nothing"?     
 That child, it may not be my seed...     
 but it is still my blood.     
 After all I've done for you, you owe me that respect.     
 All you done is what suited you     
 since the day you came back up here.     
 All right, now, you listen to me.     
 I am... your husband.     
 And I have fought for you.     
 I have honored you. I have defended you.     
 I'd have died for you and I would again.     
 I know you would've, Foster...     
 but only because it's easier than living for me.     
 What we have, it wasn't born out of love.     
 It was born out of fear, mine and yours,     
 and it was never meant for this world.     
 All right, G'winveer...

 HOUGHTON: Cause of death is asphyxiation by strangulation,     
 - manner of death, suicide. 
- Mm-hmm.     
 What's this? What's this up here?     
 Subdural hematoma just above the occipital ridge.     
 It's a, it's a bump on the back of the head.     
 Some swelling, a small laceration, half inch.     
 How long that'd happen before she died?     
 I'd say a few minutes before the actual time of death,     
 that's my estimate.     
 A few minutes? I mean, how'd she manage that?     
 Well, she hung herself in the shower, Wade.     
 It's a tight space. She would've convulsed.     
 You know, muscle activity can last as long as eight minutes,     
 sometimes more.     
 It's consistent with the manner of death.
