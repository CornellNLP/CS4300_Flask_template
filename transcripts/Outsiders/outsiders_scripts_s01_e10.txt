 Previously on "Outsiders"... 
 Caleb? Uhh! 
 No, his phone's still going straight to voice-mail. 
 These Farrells been making us poor since my Daddy got stopped for mining. 
 We want jobs, we gotta get them down off of there. 
 I still say we blast 'em off. 
 Come near my sister again, I'll kill you. 
 [Grunting] 
 My name's Haylie Grimes. 
 Well, I am here to -- to set you free and to offer you a job. 
 Liaison between you and your family. 
 I got something that'll make a warp drive look like an '85 pinto. 
 Genuine Farrell wine. 
 Give me a taste, Donnie? 
 More where that came from. Tell your friends. 
 G'winveer, will you be my queen? 
 I accept. 
 Our new Bren'in is right. 
 He knows that we have a war to fight. 
 'Cause them low-land cowards, they could be upon us any moment. 
 You took everything from me. 
 Go on. Finish what you started the day I was born. 
 You wanna go get killed? You go do it to yourself. 
 Foster! 
 Whoever it was that made you climb up there, they're the ones who's lost. 
 Our power's our bond, not our fire. 
 We're gonna fight back. Are you with us, Asa Farrell? 
 Ged-gedyah. 
 Uh, sir. 
 What's up? 
 [Sighs] Goddamn. 
 Um, I plain forgot. 
 Oh, man, what was I about to say? 
 Uh... 
 That's it. Uh, there's someone missing. 
 I can't remember who. 
 That's real helpful, Wade. 
 Wait... 
 [Police radio chatter] 
 It's me. 
 It's me. 
 I could show you where I am. 
 Okay. Okay, son. 
 We'll head on up there. 
 But first, we gotta have a little talk about you maybe taking some time off. 
 You're all stressed out. 
 I think the best course -- aah! 
 Goddamn it! 
 I blame you for this. 
 Mm.

 Tired of these goddamn dishes. 
 [Chuckles] Sick of looking at 'em. 
 Where'd you get this? 
 Tell me! 
 No! 
 Where did you get this? 
 Sorry, Pat. 
 [Gasps] 
 [Gasps] 
 Jesus! Jane! 
 What the hell did you do, Jane? 
 [Dog panting] 
 Hey. 
 You know, I just realized, if we don't find him, if he's dead, you'll be in charge. 
 You're next in line, right? 
 [Sighs] 
 It's a search, Dolan. 
 Doesn't work if we walk together. 
 Got it. 
 ♪ 
 [Door bell jingles] 
 [Whistles] 
 Oh, my god. 
 Oh, my sweet lovin' Jesus. Where you been, boy? 
 I told you I'll be back in a day or two to check on you. 
 You have no idea what's been going on around here. 
 I sold out the first day. Every jar. 
 People been knocking down my door trying to get more. 
 I had to disconnect my phone. 
 Well, I got you two more jugs. 
 That's it? That ain't gonna do it. 
 [Door bell jingles] 
 Come on, man. 
 You got any yet, Donnie? 
 Yes, sir. Just came in. 
 Hold me two jars. I gotta get to the bank. 
 You see what I'm saying? 
 This stuff will be out the door and gone by lunchtime. 
 You gotta bring me a ton more, Asa. 
 That's not gonna be possible for a while. 
 Okay, you are killing me here, partner. 
 Look, there's a major event happening. 
 We come up short on wine, some heads are gonna roll, and I guarantee you, mine's gonna be first on the block. 
 [Wind whistling] 
 Yeah, very, very nice. 
 Yeah. They got a good look to 'em. 
 But we're gonna need a whole mess more, jimjack. 
 Well, how many you thinking? 
 Yeah, well, to start, I'd say hunt every turkey, every rabbit on the mountain. 
 [Laughter] 
 This ain't meant to be no regular wedding feast. 
 Clan folk a hundred year on, whenever there's a wedding, I want them saying, "yeah, this feast, it's fine. 
 But it ain't nothing like the feast at big Foster's wedding." 
 [Laughter] 
 [Groans, coughs] 
 [Spits] 
 [Coughing] 
 You okay, Bren'in? 
 [Coughs] Yeah, stomach's just a little sour is all. 
 Maybe we should cancel your party tonight if you're too nervous about the wedding. 
 Hey. If you was marrying that girl? 
 Nervous is the last thing you'd be. 
 [Laughter] 
 I want boar, I want deer, I want pheasant, and you? 
 Huh? I want you to get a couple big snappers. 
 Yeah, we're gonna fry those up. 
 We're gonna put out a spread no one will forget. 
 I'll tell you what, on your wedding night, you're gonna get a spread you'll never forget. 
 [Laughter] 
 Right. 
 [Choking, coughing] 
 Now, I could be angry right now, but a good leader, I have been told, doesn't let his emotions influence his behavior. 
 So I'm just gonna suggest you shouldn't talk about your queen in such a lowly manner, huh? 
 I've learned the young lady has a lot to offer, and a lot more than what's obvious. 
 [Coughs] 
 That was your fault. 
 Making me do that. 
 [Loud clanging] 
 [Grunts] 
 [Clanging continues] 
 [Banging on pipe] 
 [Grunting] 
 Help! [Continues grunting] 
 Help! 
 Wade? 
 [Grunting] 
 Yeah! 
 [Clank] 
 Wade Houghton? 
 Yeah, come on. 
 I found him! Get over here! He's over here! 
 All right, buddy, we'll have you out. 
 We'll have you out soon. 
 What's this called again? 
 Macaroni. 
 Macaroni. 
 And cheese. 
 [Laughs] 
 You like it? 
 Mm-hmm. The thing I liked more than the taste, though... 
 [Sniffles] 
 That color. 
 You got a lot of foods down here that color? 
 No. Thank god. 
 Thank you. 
 Mm-hmm, welcome. 
 [Whispers] You taste good. 
 [Laughing] 
 So... what's it like up there? 
 Folks around here, they... 
 They tell all kind of tales about the mountain. 
 Stuff about ghosts and... 3-headed bears? 
 3-headed bears? Come on! 
 [Laughs] 
 You show me 3-headed bears, I'll tangle with 'em right now. 
 [Laughs] 
 So? 
 What's the mountain really like? 
 Well, it's beautiful. 
 Yeah? 
 Up there, everywhere you look, you see wonders. 
 I mean, you got a sky... 
 That's close enough to touch. 
 And rock cliffs that have been around since the first dawn. 
 It's green. Deep green. 
 Wraps you up and hides you whenever you feel the need. 
 There's some nights up there when the sky's so clear, there's more stars than you can count. 
 The air is so sweet, can make your whole head lighter than a jug of wine. 
 [Chuckles] 
 So why would you ever want to come down here? 
 'Cause you always gotta be ready for new wonders. 
 Like those white things right there. 
 [Laughs] 
 What -- [Laughs] 
 What are those again? 
 Marshmallow. 
 Marshmallow. 
 Tell you what, whoever named these things ain't never been near a marsh before. 
 [Laughs] 
 [Animal howls in distance] 
 There's all this talk about guns. I don't like it. 
 Fire never solves nothing. 
 Only makes more trouble. 
 Asa knows what he's doing. 
 He's the only one that can do it. 
 Now's not the time for questioning -- unless it's directed at our so-called Bren'in. 
 Asa cares about the clan, our future. 
 More than big Foster ever will. 
 Now if you don't believe that, I suggest you pick yourself up and show me heels. 
 [All murmuring] 
 Talk to 'em. 
 [Animal howls in distance] 
 [Bird hooting in distance] 
 Y'all have questions. 
 And you should. 
 I'd be happy to answer them the best I can. 
 You see, that's what we're doing. 
 We're communicating. 
 Big Foster -- all he knows is intimidation, violence, aggression. 
 And that's why we're forced to answer in kind. 
 And that is why I'm getting the guns. 
 With fire, we can stand up to big Foster. 
 But we have a small problem. 
 If we don't have enough hands to put those guns in, they're useless. 
 We gotta raise our numbers. 
 I mean, yeah, we're a small group. 
 But we're passionate, right? 
 Yeah. 
 That's right. 
 Now the wedding is in two days' time. 
 Clan's gonna come together. 
 Okay, go speak to your families. 
 Go speak to the people that are closest to you. 
 And if they're like-minded, ask them to join us. 
 But I warn you -- be careful. 
 'Cause if we're caught, well... 
 It could mean banishment... 
 Or even worse. 
 [All murmuring] 
 When you're... down here... 
 With me... 
 Mm. 
 Do you ever miss your family? 
 My folks -- they passed on when I was a baby. 
 How? 
 My ma, she, uh, she passed on while -- while bringing birth to me. 
 My -- my fa, he must've loved her something powerful because they say he went crazy from the grieving. 
 He got drunk and... fell off a cliff. 
 Maybe he jumped. 
 Mm. 
 That's terrible. 
 It is. 
 So who raised you? 
 Everybody. 
 I mean, folks, they took turns. 
 That's nice. 
 I guess. 
 See, it's a funny thing when you're raised by everybody. 
 You're sorta raised by nobody. 
 So do I miss them? Yeah. 
 I miss everybody. 
 But I also miss nobody. 
 [Switch clicks] 
 What was that? 
 [Phone beeps] 
 Here, baby, hold this. 
 Ain't there like a switch or something that we could turn? 
 No, I checked the fuse box. Everything looks fine. 
 Oh, here we go. 
 That gonna tell us how to turn the electric back on? 
 No, it's gonna tell us why it's been cut off. 
 [Scoffs] The bill hasn't been paid in three months. 
 Who's bill? 
 No, babe, this. This is a bill. 
 And it tells us what we owe for the power, and we owe $192. 
 Okay, well, just -- just take it out of the money I gave you. 
 You gave most of your money to cousin Asa. 
 We have $90 left, maybe $100. 
 I knew I shouldn't have bought those steaks. 
 Hey, hey. Hey, hey, hey. No, it's okay. It's all right. 
 I'll get us some more money. Don't worry. 
 Yeah -- [Exhales deeply] 
 [Monitor beeping steadily] 
 Here you go, Sheriff. 
 You can get this filled downstairs. 
 What's this? 
 It's a prescription for pain medicine. 
 You're gonna have some achiness and some soreness over the next few days. 
 I... I don't want 'em. 
 Yeah, but you're probably gonna need it. 
 No. 
 So just keep it and -- just in case. 
 No, thank you, doctor. 
 I don't want it. 
 Okay. I'll take a look at your labs and check on you in the morning. 
 Okay, yeah. 
 [Sighs] 
 [Woman speaking indistinctly over P.A.] 
 They only got one vending machine in the place, and the only choice of sandwich was ham. 
 [Door closes] 
 Yeah, okay. 
 Why don't you lie down? 
 Might be a little more comfortable. 
 I ain't staying here. 
 Trapped here is the same as trapped in the mine. 
 Caleb coming? 
 Uh, yeah, he's on his way. 
 Wade? 
 Yeah. 
 When you first went missing, I checked over at your house. 
 I was in the garage. 
 I saw your cruiser. 
 Sit down. 
 I killed a Farrell. 
 Hid my car. 
 After the gun store robbery. 
 It was an accident. 
 Okay. 
 I was pursuing him. 
 I stopped. I let him go. 
 I turned the car around. 
 I was... high. 
 A little. 
 This kid came out of nowhere on the wrong side of the road. 
 There was nothing I could do. 
 I gave the body over to them. 
 They took him away. 
 If you feel that you need to say something, I mean, if you feel you need to report it, you go ahead. 
 How am I supposed to keep this to myself? 
 What happens if somebody finds out? 
 I'm just starting out, Wade. 
 Well, it's your call. 
 Maybe you ought to take some time off. 
 [Inhales deeply] I've been off ever since my wife died. 
 Yeah, I think I'm about done with that. 
 Daddy! 
 Hey, hey, hey. Come here. 
 You all right? You all right? 
 Mm-hmm. 
 I'm okay. 
 I'm gonna be okay. Uh... 
 Get a doctor in here. Get me unplugged. 
 We're going home. 
 [Whistling] 
 [Keys jingle] 
 [Clicks tongue] 
 Hey. 
 Hey. If you guys are looking for shine, I'm all out. 
 Why don't you check back in a day or two? 
 So you admit to selling that poison? 
 Hell, yeah. Made more money on that stuff than the shop's cleared in a whole year. 
 So you're friendly with them? 
 Well, I... only know one of them, really. 
 When's he coming back here again? 
 I'd like to have a word with him. 
 I don't know. 
 [Door bell jingles] 
 I think you do know. 
 And you better be telling us 'cause, you never know, there's fires that happen. 
 [Door bells jingle] 
 All right, we don't want to do all that now. 
 You can't threaten me. 
 Oh, sure we can. 
 My wife nearly killed herself thanks to you! 
 Come on. Come on. 
 You son of a bitch. 
 Come on. Get out here, come on. 
 Stop doing business with the Farrells. 
 Get the hell outta here. 
 [Gumballs rattle] 
 Hey. You can't take that! 
 That's shoplifting. I'm calling the cops. 
 You son of a bitch! 
 No! Aah! 
 [Alarm ringing] 
 Come on. Come on. 
 Goddamn sons of bitches! That don't hurt me! 
 I'm insured. 
 [Exhales] 
 [Hammer clicks] 
 Good morning, cousin. 
 It was until about a second ago. 
 So what is this? 
 Your way of saying thank you for me saving you from hanging yourself? 
 Can you see me? 
 What? 
 Can you hear what I'm saying? 
 Of course I can. What are you talking about? 
 Ever since I lost my fa, lost G'win, people have been treating me like I'm a goddamn ghost. 
 You know he spit on me? 
 Treating me like I was a goddamn stray dog every day of my life. 
 I was so stupid. I used to think, "well, at least I'm  his  stray dog." 
 Now I'm nothing. 
 If I was you, I would consider yourself lucky. 
 Your old man is lost. Not you. 
 I'm thinking maybe it's easier if he's lost altogether, what do you think? 
 Say what now? 
 Tomorrow at that wedding, before he takes his vows, I'm gonna kill him. 
 Oh, well. 
 That'll make the event worthwhile. 
 So what are you gonna use? Your knife? 
 People say you're, uh, you're pretty strong with a blade. 
 Wouldn't be able to get close enough. 
 I'm gonna need your help with that. 
 You want me to smuggle you in a weapon? 
 The weapon's already handled. 
 Foster, what are you gonna do, huh? 
 You just gonna walk in there, pull it out, get down to business? 
 You think no one else is gonna notice what's going down? 
 That's where I need your help, all right? 
 You're a good man at pissing off my fa. 
 I need you to go in there and start acting like yourself. 
 Get everybody look at you. That way they ain't looking at me. 
 Foster, have you ever been to a wedding? Huh? 
 Know who stands next to the groom? 
 Think about it. 
 What happens if you miss and you kill her? 
 Can you live with that? 
 'Cause I sure as hell can't. 
 Now you listen to me. I ain't asking you. 
 You have to help me. 
 What do you mean, I have to help you? 
 Because you saved my life. 
 Anything I do from this moment forward, you're part responsible for. 
 If you're in it for part, why not be in it all the way, huh? 
 Foster, no.

 I need more money. 
 That does surprise me. 
 I always thought your people didn't believe in money. 
 They don't, but I got myself into a bit of a situation. 
 Is Sally-Ann pregnant? 
 That ain't none of your business, but no. 
 So what'd you do with all the money I gave you? 
 I spent it. 
 All right. 
 I can give you another $250. 
 This is the last time I'm gonna do this. 
 And it is not a loan. It's an advance. 
 Thank you. 
 Talk to you soon. 
 Yep. 
 [Indistinct conversations] 
 About how many were there? 
 Four. Came in like a gang. 
 Recognize any of 'em? 
 Sure. There's Pat Kersey. 
 He's the one that knocked my display case down. 
 And then there was, uh, Jake whatever his name is. 
 He lives over near bandits Holler. 
 And then there was a black one, okay? 
 He's the one that said he was gonna come back and burn my place down. 
 Is he another miner? You know his name? 
 He's black. [Chuckles] 
 Yeah, sir, just 'cause I got a mustache and a badge, don't go assuming I'm a racist. 
 You got any idea why you were targeted? 
 Nope. 
 Some random bullshit. 
 Random bullshit. All right, well, we'll get back to you with a report. 
 I appreciate it. 
 Oh, uh, Breece Dobbs. 
 What? 
 He was the other one. 
 ♪ 
 Are you serious? 
 My little brother worked with him down in the mine. 
 Same crew. It was him. 
 Breece Dobbs? You're sure? 
 Positive. 
 Yeah, okay. Thank you.

 Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

 Hey, hey. Stop it.

 So let's stop talking about it and do something! 
 I say we buy us four, five jugs of kerosene, go up there, and burn their asses out. 
 Yeah, yeah. 
 Let's go up there and cut the head off the damn snake! 
 Damn right. 
 Damn right. Let's go. 
 You really think it's gonna be that easy? 
 It is not gonna be that easy, I promise you.

 I guess you're gonna have to go ahead and arrest me now. 
 This make you feel like a big man, Wade? Huh? 
 Walk me out of my own house in handcuffs? Son of a bitch. 
 We're gonna go round and round on this, I promise you.

 Breece would never do anything like that, and you know it. 
 Well, he just told me he did. So just go and ask him. 
 Honey, I'm gonna deal with it. It's gonna be all right.

 Your comfort. 
 [Breathing heavily] 
 Your caring. [Exhales] 
 What happened? Tell me. 
 No, just let me hold you. 
 G'winveer... 
 I need us to be one. 
 [Kissing] 
 Wait. Wait, wait, wait. 
 Let me take the dress off. 
 [Dress drops to floor] 
 [Breathing heavily] 
 [Cracking sound] 
 [Door creaks] 
 What you want? 
 So tomorrow... 
 How big a distraction you looking for? 
 [Door creaks] 
 [Door closes] 
 Mornin'. 
 Sorry we had to hold you overnight. 
 Judge just set your bail. 
 So I can go? 
 No. 
 You can go as soon as someone ponies up. 
 Hey, Breece, uh, these friends of yours, this, um, uh, posse -- well, your, uh, your associations aren't really working out for you. 
 Yeah. You're right. I should listen to you, Wade. 
 Drive your wife to kill herself, can't be a dad for more than two days without dumping your kid at our place. 
 What other advice you got for me? 
 Well, lord, I mean, I got plenty, only I ain't gonna share it with you 'cause, uh, you know, I just remembered that I always thought you were a turd. 
 You know, prisoners get oatmeal in the morning so, uh, I'll see they, uh, give you a little extra. 
 [Door opens] 
 [Door closes] 
 Hi. Is this Janelle Busser? 
 Hi, Janelle. You don't know me. 
 My name's Haylie Grimes, and I'm calling from Blackburg, Kentucky. 
 I just relocated to the area and I just saw the cutest little house on booth hill road that I was told belonged to your late aunt Naomi. 
 Oh, my condolences. 
 Well, listen, do you happen to have any plans for that property? 
 'Cause, well, I would like to offer you $25,000 in cash for it. 
 What do you think? 
 Reckon some of my associations are working out just fine, huh? 
 [Telephone ringing in distance] 
 Listen, Breece. 
 Whatever you're doing, it's not gonna end well, all right? 
 You gotta think about your family. 
 Next time I see you, we're gonna take this badge off and we're gonna see how things end up for you. 
 [Police radio chatter] 
 Over here, amigo. 
 Where'd you get bail money? 
 The guys for sure didn't have it, so I went to see your boss, that miss Grimes girl. 
 You seen Pat or Jake? 
 Yeah. 
 I wanted to go up there with them, but they wouldn't let me. They said I'd slow 'em down. 
 Where? Up on Shay? 
 They got them a bunch of kerosene. 
 Say they aim to roast up some Farrell. 
 How long ago they leave? 
 Well, the crack of dawn. A while ago. 
 They'll be up there pretty soon. 
 Hey, hey, we'll never catch up to them. 
 [Engine starts] 
 Hey, hey! Hey! 
 Hey, you be careful! 
 That's my mother's truck!

 You really think this belongs to the Farrells? 
 Don't seem high enough. 
 But we come all this way, I'm torching something. 
 Yeah, let's send 'em a message. 
 Sacred land, my ass. [Laughter] 
 Get out of there, Jake. 
 [Lighter clicks] 
 Well... 
 [Laughs] 
 Sacred land! 
 Burn it! 
 Oh, yeah! 
 Yeah! 
 Yeah! 
 [Laughs] 
 What the hell's going on there? 
 You don't belong up here. 
 We're on your land now, Farrell! 
 [Gunshots, laughter] 
 It's our land! 
 Come on! bring it on! 
 [Cheering] All right,  gedgedyah! 
 Hold it down now. Hush up! 
 You ready to run the gauntlet, Foster? 
 Well, this is the one time I feel more sorry for the men trying to stop the groom than the groom himself! 
 [Laughter] 
 Good luck to you, boys! 
 Let's do it. 
 Well, don't stand there like statues. 
 On your mark! 
 On your mark! 
 Get set! 
 Get set. 
 Hold on. Stop, stop. Foster, Foster. 
 Criminals. [Exhales] We're being invaded. 
 What the hell you talking about? 
 The outsiders are here. 
 They set fire to cearbhall's place down below the crags. 
 You get these guys together. Some of you, you come with me! 
 Yeah! 
 Go with them. 
 Breece should see this. He was the one bellyaching about how hard it was gonna be to do this. 
 [Laughter] Torch it up. 
 [Engines revving in distance] 
 Y'all hear that? 
 Sounds like we're gonna get us some company. 
 I got a welcome ready. 
 [Revving continues] 
 [Engines revving] 
 [Gunshot] 
 [Grunts] 
 [Chain clanking] 
 [Engines revving]

 We give chase, Bren'in? 
 Couple of you boys go down and make sure they're gone. 
 Another day, I'd do it myself. 
 But today, I gotta get myself married.

 Are you both prepared to take your most solemn vows? 
 Just get on with it. Join us. 
 Here on this most blessed day, you two stand in witness of Shay, Farrell, and McGintuk alike, and enter unto a bond that -- should we really be doing this now? 
 Oh, who the hell is that? 
 Oh, like I didn't know. Get the hell out of here. 
 We've just been attacked. 
 Several of our homes have just been destroyed. 
 Oh, yeah? Well, maybe those demons were friends of yours from down below. 
 Maybe that's why you weren't there to help us beat them back. 
 Let's go. 
 My only friends are my cousins on this mountain who I would die to protect, which is more than you would ever do, Foster. 
 Asa, stop it! 
 Do you have any idea what's going on here? 
 Who was it chased them off? Huh? Me. 
 Me and some other brave men. That's who. 
 I didn't see your yellow face down there amongst our number. 
 Do you even care about this clan, Foster? 
 All you care about is yourself and your own agenda. 
 Asa, is your voice the only one you hear? 
 Will somebody shut him up? 
 You're the one that cares about himself more than any other. 
 Like wandering off down there, sucking in all their lostie poison. 
 Now you come back here -- 
 Asa, you can't stop this. Okay? 
 [Spits] 
 You can't. 
 Now, y'all listen to me. 
 [Exhales] 
 There are trying times ahead and we need a Bren'in who cares more about his people than he does about himself. 
 Oh, we're done now, son. 
 [Grunts] 
 All right, we good now, boys? 
 All set, Bren'in. 
 All right. Let's continue. 
 Here on this most blessed day -- 
 Big Foster! 
 [Groans] 
 Whatever it is, just let us get this done. 
 Come on up. 
 [Exhales] 
 [Murmuring] 
 Just chain him up, all right? You fools. 
 I don't want more interruptions. 
 I haven't done nothing against you. 
 Only reason I come up here is to stop them boys from making trouble. 
 Making trouble? We took a gun off him. 
 Oh, got a gun, do he? 
 But you didn't come up here to cause trouble. Okay. 
 Now I want you all to hear this, okay? 
 I've been warning you on these demons. 
 I'm gonna tell you, they's after us. 
 Now we got one here with a gun right close enough to touch. 
 All right? Now you see how they are. 
 Say any old lie to save their skins. 
 It is not a lie. 
 I chased your friends off. 
 Nah, you're not gonna be so fortunate. 
 You let me go, and I'll make sure they don't come back up here, I swear to you. Please. 
 On the lives of my kids. You won't see 'em again, I swear. You'll never see me again! 
 Guaranteed I won't see you again.
