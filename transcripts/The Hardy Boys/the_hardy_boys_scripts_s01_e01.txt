 - Uh, that's great. 
 - GLORIA: Mm-hmm. 
 Uh, me and my dad were thinking about schools close to home in the city. 
 Nonsense. 
 Think bigger. 
 Think biggest. 
 Think Rosegray Preparatory Academy. 
 Now, young Joseph, I have been making some plans for you, too. 
 Uh, thanks, but I don't really wanna pad my resume. 
 [GLORIA LAUGHS] 
 No, I was thinking more along the lines of active summer diversions. 
 How would you like to learn to ride horses? 
 - JOE: Horses? 
 - GLORIA: Mm-hmm. 
 JOE: That's pretty awesome. 
 [BIG BAND MUSIC PLAYING] 
 [INDISTINCT CHATTER] 
 Is Grandma, like, the Queen of Bridgeport? 
 TRUDY: No, Joe. 
 - Yes. 
 - [ALL LAUGHING] 
 GLORIA: Hey, there you are! 
 Hello. 
 Hello. 
 [KISSES] 
 Welcome. 
 Hello, sweetheart. 
 Hello. 
 [KISSES] 
 Hi, hi, hi. 
 FENTON: Nice to see you. 
 Hi. 
 - Thanks for having us. 
 - GLORIA: Thanks for coming. 
 Thank you, thank you. 
 Hi, Trudy. 
 [CHUCKLES] 
 Uh, friends and neighbors, listen up for a moment. 
 Thank you all for being here. 
 I wanted you to meet my grandsons, Francis, and Joe. 
 I'm just thrilled to have them here with me. 
 So I hope you get a chance to say hi to them during the course of the evening. 
 Thank you so much. 
 [ALL APPLAUDING] 
 Go get some food, you guys. 
 Thanks for coming. 
 A lot. 
 JESSE: Just when I thought this town couldn't get any uglier. 
 Wait, is that little Jesse Hooper? 
 [LAUGHS] 
 Hey, you're a cop. 
 JESSE: For a while now. 
 EZRA: She's my deputy. 
 - Hey, Ezra. 
 - Hey. 
 I'm, uh, real sorry about Laura. 
 FENTON: Thank you. 
 I'm telling you, it was a naval mine. 
 A naval mine? 
 In Bridgeport? 
 Yeah. 
 From the war. 
 They're everywhere. 
 You know, the chains rust off, they would float to the surface, and... 
 "Kaplowie." I don't think mines go "kaplowie." Okay, Biff. 
 What sound does a mine make, then? 
 I don't know. 
 JOE: So what are we talking about? 
 CALLIE: The fishing boat that went down a couple of weeks ago. 
 Did they say what happened? 
 CALLIE: Cops think it was a gas fire. 
 JOE: Or someone could have done it on purpose. 
 CALLIE: Yeah, you're right. 
 Hey, your dad's a detective. 
 Maybe he knows. 
 But maybe he only deals with big city crimes. 
 FRANK: Huh. 
 My dad's actually from here. 
 You know any of his tricks? 
 Showed me how to dust for prints once. 
 I can pick locks. 
 Really? 
 You'll have to show me that one time. 
 JOE: Yeah, all right. 
 You boys making some new friends? 
 [CHUCKLES] 
 Oh, Callie! 
 Don't you look sweet. 
 CALLIE: Thank you, Mrs. 
 Estabrook. 
 Could I steal you away for a moment? 
 Yeah. 
 Yeah. 
 GLORIA: And that is my father. 
 George Estabrook. 
 He made the discovery that made all of this possible. 
 And that's him, too. 
 With his beloved plane. 
 FRANK: He was a pilot? 
 That's a story for another day. 
 JOE: What's that? 
 Aah. 
 That is the beast that got your Uncle Harry. 
 Um-hmm. 
 Yeah, I think I'm gonna go get some air. 
 Oh, Joe. 
 Joe, it, it's okay. 
 - [DOG BARKS] 
 - Joe, the dog! 
 - FRANK: Joe! 
 - GLORIA: Peppermint! 
 - [BARKS] 
 FRANK: Somebody stop him! 
 JOE: Peppermint! 
 FRANK: Peppermint! 
 Peppermint! 
 [OWL HOOTS] 
 Gotcha. 
 - FRANK: Joe? 
 - [JOE GRUNTING] 
 Whoa, whoa. 
 What are you doing? 
 Get off of him, man! 
 ERN: Turn off the lights. 
 Ern? 
 He's, he's okay. 
 He's okay. 
 He's fine. 
 ERN: Turn them off! 
 Now! 
 [FLASHLIGHTS CLICK OFF] 
 What do you want? 
 Do you know the lady that owns this house? 
 Go get her, and bring her to the stables. 
 I'm not going anywhere without him, okay? 
 - ERN: Now! 
 - [JOE GRUNTING] 
 Whoa. 
 'Kay! 
 ERN: And just her. 
 No one else. 
 I'm watching. 
 Joe, I'll be right back, buddy. 
 Okay? 
 [JOE GRUNTING] 
 - Francis. 
 - Grandma. 
 Did you find Peppermint? 
 I need you to come with me, okay? 
 Come with you where? 
 It's Joe. 
 [JOE GRUNTING] 
 Ern! 
 I brought her. 
 Now let him go. 
 Are you Ms. 
 Estabrook? 
 What is going on here? 
 Please put down the knife. 
 Ma'am. 
 I'm sorry to do this. 
 I was on your fishing boat. 
 The Astghik. 
 I don't recognize that name. 
 Your boat didn't sink. 
 - It blew up. 
 - GLORIA: What? 
 Yeah. 
 These men, they came on board, they killed the captain. 
 Shot the entire crew. 
 GLORIA: Well, that's terrible. 
 ERN: I was the only one who survived. 
 - [THUDS] 
 Ow! 
 [GRUNTS] 
 [HORSES NEIGHING] 
 FRANK: You okay? 
 You all right? 
 I'm good. 
 GLORIA: Sure you're not hurt? 
 So, you owned his boat? 
 Yes. 
 Yes, I, I, I may own it. 
 I don't manage these things myself. 
 Then who does? 
 I will look into it. 
 What's important is that you're okay, Joe. 
 Now, come on. 
 Let's get out of here. 
 [FOOTSTEPS DEPARTING] 
 [DOOR CLOSES] 
 FENTON: Frank. 
 I wish you would have found me first. 
 FRANK: It all kind of happened really fast. 
 ♪     I'm fine. 
 Look, Joe, I think he was just really shaken up. 
 He wasn't gonna hurt you. 
 You know, I can talk to Ezra and Jesse, and... 
 you know, we'll look into it. 
 Bridgeport's got a weird way of welcoming people. 
 FENTON: Yeah, it does. 
 But... 
 But... 
 The ice cream can't be beat. 
 [SPOONS CLATTERING] 
 [FENTON LAUGHS] 
 Armed and dangerous. 
 - FRANK: Yes. 
 - JOE: Are you kidding me? 
 No, no, no. 
 Oh, man. 
 - This is good. 
 JOE: That one's mine. 
 That one's mine. 
 [ALL CHATTERING] 
 [FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING] 
 - FRANK: Hey. 
 - Hey. 
 How'd you sleep? 
 Fine. 
 What are you doing up here? 
 Just going through boxes of Mom's old stuff. 
 This is from when you were a baby. 
 What do you think she was thinking? 
 I know she wanted a girl. 
 [LAUGHS] 
 No, no. 
 In the car. 
 [MELANCHOLY MUSIC PLAYING] 
 I don't know. 
 Can't believe we're never gonna see her again. 
 Daddy took the camera. 
 Look at Joe. 
 Hi! 
 Look it. 
 That's Dadda. 
 Can you say hi? 
 - YOUNG FRANK: Hi. 
 - LAURA: Give him a kiss. 
 Aw, you're such a good boy. 
 [LAUGHING]: Oh, my God. 
 [KISSES] 
 Oh! 
 Oh! 
 You've gotta let go of my hair, though. 
 [LAUGHING] 
 [JOE LAUGHING] 
 Oh. 
 Hi! 
 You laugh like her. 
 LAURA [ON VIDEO]: Oh, my gosh. 
 Hey, Frank. 
 How's it going? 
 How's the maze? 
 See the stars? 
 [GASPS] 
 Do you wanna dance with me? 
 I'm gonna dance with my baby. 
 - [LAURA LAUGHING] 
 - [THUNK] 
 Do you hear that? 
 Is it from the garage? 
 It's probably just Trudy. 
 It's gone. 
 It didn't sound like Trudy. 
 [TENSE MUSIC PLAYING] 
 [WOMAN SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY] 
 JOE: Who's that? 
 - I don't know. 
 - FENTON: You heard about my reputation. 
 You probably heard what my family's going through right now. 
 Well, that's why I'm here. 
 It's about your wife. 
 My nephew Rupert was in charge of much of our company's interests, but he started acting strange. 
 Paranoid, even. 
 Then three weeks ago, he disappeared. 
 Travel records show that he came to Bridgeport. 
 And the day your wife died, phone records from the hotel show that he called her three times. 
 Excuse me? 
 Your wife was a journalist. 
 Yes? 
 No, not, not in the last couple of years. 
 I believe she was still working. 
 She was investigating something, and Rupert was her source. 
 I think that whatever he told her... 
 It got her killed. 
 Where's your nephew now? 
 [SCOFFS] 
 That's why I'm here. 
 After he checked out of the hotel in Bridgeport, he disappeared again. 
 An associate said that he saw Rupert back home, but all my attempts to find him have been fruitless, and I just want to get to him and get him help. 
 And I believe you're the man to find him. 
 I just, I can't really pick up and go overseas right now. 
 Well, if you want to find your wife's killer, it's a trail that must be followed. 
 Call me when you make a decision. 
 I'll be staying in Bridgeport the next few weeks. 
 And... 
 Make your decision quickly. 
 I believe that time is of the essence. 
 - Frank. 
 - [DOOR OPENS] 
 What's going on? 
 What does she mean? 
 [DOOR CLOSES] 
 It wasn't an accident. 
 Somebody killed Mom. 
 ♪     We need to do something. 
 We gotta help Dad. 
 We're gonna find out what happened to Mom.
