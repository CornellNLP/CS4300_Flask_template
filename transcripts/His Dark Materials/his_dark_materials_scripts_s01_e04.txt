 Hm. 
 You're excited! 
 Damn right I am. 
 Finally got a lead on Iorek. 
 He might not be the same bear, the Iorek I knew... 
 Some crazy seal hunter got him drunk, tricked him out of his armour. 
 An armoured bear is nothing without his armour. 
 Hester! 
 I'm right here. 
 What do you see? 
 Looks like we're not the only ones heading to Trollesund. 
 Lee, are you sure Iorek will want us making trouble? 
 That bear saved our lives, Hester. We owe him trouble.

 Hey! 
 This is an oil port. There's no smoking on the quay. 
 Then I nearly made a horrible mistake. 
 Lee Scoresby, aeronaut for hire. 
 Tell me, who are all these people here? 
 My question exactly. 
 New arrivals arouse suspicion. 
 I did hear a rumour that interested me. 
 Rumour of a bear. 
 Any truth to that? 
 Yes, I heard a rumour, too, of an aeronaut who creates bedlam wherever he goes. 
 Any truth to that? 
 Here we go again. 
 Friendly place. Yeah. 
 No, it's not. 
 Can we just stay out of trouble? 
 Gyptians. 
 Never seen them so far North. 
 The spy fly will have reached Mrs Coulter by now. 
 Our business here must be in haste. 
 I don't like it here either. 
 Go see the witches' consul, get whatever help you can, and we leave here as fast as possible. 
 It's been 40 years since I saw Serafina last. 
 She might not like what she sees. 
 I remember you as a younger man, Coram. 
 You weren't much to look at even then. 
 [THEY CHUCKLE] 
 You're sure you should take the girl? 
 Something tells me I'll need her. 
 PAN: Quite something, all this. 
 My whole life I've wanted to be here, and now that I'm here, I'm not so sure I want to be. 
 Lyra. 
 Lyra. 
 A word, please. 
 I need to know if I can trust in your readings of the alethiometer. 
 How do you decipher it? 
 I kind of feel them or see them. 
 It's like... like going down a ladder at night. 
 [SHOUTING] 
 You put your foot down, and there's another rung. 
 Well, I put my mind down, and there's another meaning. 
 I sort of... sense what they mean. 
 It's got a trick in it. 
 Sort of like focusing your eyes. 
 Ah. 
 So say you wanted to ask the alethiometer what your parents are doing now? 
 Well, the Madonna is Mrs Coulter. 
 Oh. 
 The Madonna, is it? 
 And for Asriel, it would be the globe. 
 So I think of my parents when I put my hand there. 
 And... then I go for the ant because that means busy. 
 But how do you know what these meanings are? 
 Hm? 
 The Magisterium. 
 Put it away, Lyra. 
 You understand, the man we're going to see is important. 
 Yes. 
 The Witch Consul is a link between the human world and the witches. 
 He will decide whether to pass our message on. 
 And we need the witches. 
 Yes, but he'll want to know everything. 
 The Consul is the only way to contact the witches, and he must trust us first, but if he does, a witch called Serafina Pekkala will surely come to our aid. 
 With her help, we will find the children. 
 You mean she'll lead us to Roger? Yes. 
 Just follow my lead. 
 Keep that thing hidden, okay? 
 [KNOCKING ON DOOR] 
 How can I help you, Farder Coram? 
 I met a witch some years ago in the Fen country of Eastern Anglia. 
 Her name was Serafina Pekkala. 
 I wish to get a message to her. 
 I'm aware of your relationship with Serafina Pekkala, Farder Coram. 
 I represent a number of Gyptian families who have lost children. 
 We believe there is an organisation that is capturing these children, ours and others, and taking them North. 
 We need her help to get them free. 
 Well... 
 You realise that relations between the witches and the authorities are... perfectly cordial. 
 It is my job to keep them that way. 
 You refer... to the Magisterium. 
 This fight is not ours. 
 They are stealing children. 
 This is war for all of us. 
 And I know Serafina will want to be part of it. 
 The children do not remain here for long. 
 They are taken some distance inland. 
 Do you know what happens to them there? 
 I've heard variously of the Maystadt process, or an... intercision. 
 The process is shrouded in secrecy, but the rumours are disturbing. 
 There's a reason why you don't see a child on the streets of Trollesund. 
 We, too, have felt the effects of missing children. 
 Then I will leave you... to let Serafina know what we ask of her. 
 Come. 
 I understand you are in possession of an alethiometer. 
 I have eyes everywhere in Trollesund. 
 Yes. 
 May I look at it? 
 It's exquisite. 
 Do you possess the books of readings? 
 Actually... 
 ... I can read it. 
 You are very wise to say so. 
 How? 
 I just can. 
 Well... I wonder if I might ask to see you do so. 
 Down here, there are many sprigs of cloud-pine. 
 Which one belongs to Serafina Pekkala? 
 I can summon the witches through cloud-pine. 
 Each spray of cloud-pine is specific to a witch. 
 [ALETHIOMETER CLICKS] 
 Show us which one is Serafina Pekkala's. 
 Chameleon... 
 ... and the Moon. 
 This one's hers. 
 I'd like to give you something to take away with you. 
 Carry this spray with you, and if you ever truly need her... 
 ... she will come. 
 Dr Lanselius, may I ask you something? 
 Of course. 
 What question should we be asking you that we are not? 
 You're weak. 
 You may have heart, but the Magisterium have muscle. 
 I would ask where I could obtain the services of an armoured bear. 
 I understood the armoured bears answered to nobody. 
 There is at least one who does. 
 An exile. 
 He shamed his people, but be warned... his skill with metal makes him useful to the town. 
 They don't like strangers knowing about him or interfering in his affairs. 
 You'll find him beside Einarsson's Bar. 
 But to get him away... will take some doing. 
 His name... is Iorek Byrnison. 
 Iorek Byrnison! 
 [GROWLING] 
 [GROWLING] 
 Iorek Byrnison, can we talk with you? 
 We wish to offer you employment. 
 DEEP VOICE: I am employed. 
 We need fighters, or... in all probability, we will. 
 We're going North till we find the place where children are being kept captive. 
 When we find them, there will surely be a battle. 
 [GROWLING] 
 What do you do... in the metalworks? 
 I mend the broken machinery. 
 I lift heavy objects. 
 And what kind of work is that for a panserbjorn? 
 [IOREK ROARS] 
 If you'll excuse me saying, Iorek Byrnison... 
 ... you could be living free and proud on the ice, hunting seal and walrus, or going to war, winning great prizes. 
 [HE GROWLS] 
 I know the people you are seeking. 
 The child cutters. 
 People of this town, they pretend not to see, but I see. 
 And are you a coward like they are? [HE GROWLS] 
 A coward? 
 [HE GROWLS] 
 [LOW GROWL] 
 We need you. 
 I am not for sale. 
 It's quiet today. 
 Big hearing in the Consistorial Court. 
 Oh, is that right? 
 And I thought it was because everyone knew that I was coming. 
 We didn't announce it. No, I know. 
 Trying to be funny. My apologies. 
 [SHE LAUGHS] 
 They do like to look at me, though, as I pass. 
 Well... you've acquired a reputation. 
 A reputation for stirring up trouble. 
 Now, quickly. 
 The cardinal will not be kept waiting. 
 I thought I was perfectly clear. 
 You were. 
 Try to keep your head down. Show some restraint. 
 No, you express it all most eloquently. 
 Yet not a few days later, you invaded a college protected by scholastic sanctuary and undermining a centuries-old relationship. Yes. 
 It was very unfortunate. 
 [DOOR OPENS] 
 It's good to see you again, Marisa. 
 It has been some time. 
 Not so long. 
 Can I get anything for you? 
 I know how much you like your sustenances. 
 Food, tea, water? 
 I arrived fed and watered. 
 Just skip to the part where you reveal what punishment you intend for me, hm? 
 Punishment? 
 Such a strange word. 
 I don't intend to punish you. [SHE LAUGHS] 
 I'm sure that's not true. 
 I fear our project has become too noisy. 
 I am passing leadership of the Oblation Board onto Father MacPhail, and, as of now, you are stripped of all official duties. 
 Hm. 
 Hm? 
 [SHE CLAPS] 
 Beautifully done. Hm. 
 Now, should I tell you why you won't, and why I go North tomorrow? 
 I have Lord Asriel. 
 You have Asriel? 
 In a jail... 
 ... controlled by bears, who are, in this case... 
 ... controlled by me. 
 I will travel to the North, and I will give him to you as an act of service, and, in return, you'd allow me to pursue our project until its end. 
 And you would allow me to ask one question of Fra Pavel... 
 ... and his alethiometer. 
 That seems like a high price. 
 For Asriel, it's cheap. 
 Now, shall we sit... 
 ... and discuss how to proceed? 
 Please. 
 Lyra, the way you spoke to that bear, he could have torn your throat out. 
 And you could've imprisoned me, and sold me back to Mrs Coulter. 
 I know who to trust, Farder Coram. 
 But if you're wrong, you could do yourself damage. 
 I'd do myself... more damage not trusting anyone. 
 What happened between you and Serafina? 
 We loved each other. 
 You loved a witch? 
 We had a child. 
 A son. 
 There was an epidemic. 
 There was nothing we could do. 
 He died. 
 And she wanted to rip the world apart... 
 ... fly to Yambe-Akka, fight her... 
 ... if that's what it took to get him back. 
 I wanted to mourn... in peace. 
 Haven't seen her since... 
 [SHAKILY]: ... after we buried my boy. 
 So sorry, Farder Coram. 
 It was a long time ago. 
 Say what you like about the North, wherever you go is guaranteed to be a bar full of men who should be at home but aren't. 
 Any gentlemen in the mood for a game of Hazard? 
 No? 
 How about a game of Flippity Flop? 
 It's real simple. 
 There are three pots. 
 A flip pot, lot pot, a game pot. 
 As long as you can stake a pot, you can play. 
 Will you join me in a glass of hot rum? 
 My round. 
 I'm just looking for some conversation, you see. 
 What are you all afraid of? 
 That I'll learn your secrets? 
 That I'm... 
 ... grubbing for shady business? I'm not. 
 I am simply after a bear. 
 It's kind of royal looking, fancy armour. 
 I know. Strange for these parts. 
 You know what a bear looks like, don't you? 
 Thick coat, big teeth, cute little nose. 
 Right. 
 Well, at this point, you're either being ignorant or wilfully obstructive. 
 [MAN YELLS] 
 What are you thinking?! 
 Come here! [MAN LAUGHS] 
 You started the fight, now you're losing the fight! 
 I know what you're going to say. 
 [HE YELLS OUT] 
 Come on, up! 
 Lee, your turn! Do something! 
 [HE GRUNTS] Okay, you got to kick. 
 That's right, kick again! 
 Bottle! 
 [SHOUTING] 
 That was nice. 
 Love it. More of that. 
 No! Hey! You almost got me. 
 [GRUNTING] 
 [YELLING] 
 Nice kick! 
 All right, we're having fun now. 
 Come on! 
 [GRUNTING] Hey, Lee! 
 You got this! 
 What are you doing, going high? 
 You can't go high. They're going to get you! 
 Whoa! Hold him! 
 Argh! Throw him out! 
 Quit asking about bears, aeronaut. 
 Well, that showed them. 
 I'd like to think I made my point. 
 And what point was that? 
 Three watches and a wallet. 
 I've wanted to visit this room for quite some time. 
 He's normally very careful of who he allows up. 
 You understand anything you ask me may take weeks of study. 
 I want a guarantee that, whatever you find out, I'll be the first to know. 
 What is your question? 
 It's a simple one. 
 Who is Lyra Belacqua? 
 Surely you of all... Just ask the question, Fra Pavel. 
 Has anyone seen a bear?! 
 What do you want with a bear? 
 You're bleeding. 
 Hazard of the job. 
 And what job do you do? 
 I'm in aeronautics. 
 What part of being an aeronaut...? Let me give you a tip, kid. 
 Never upset a seagull. 
 You're not serious. Not if I can help it. 
 Will he want to see you, this bear? 
 I hope so. 
 You know where he is, don't you? 
 The town's no place for Iorek. How do you know him? 
 Well, she's just a sprung box, isn't she? 
 She just keeps asking questions. 
 Lee Scoresby. 
 Can you tell me where to find him? 
 I'm just following her lead. 
 What is it about him? 
 What's keeping him trapped? 
 Kid, I'll tell you that when you tell me what you know. 
 Another time. 
 Why won't you tell me? 
 Because we need him, and I'm not sure that you won't take him from us. 
 Serafina once told me of a prophecy about a child. 
 I think it could be Lyra. 
 People see something in her. 
 You should have seen Dr Lanselius. 
 The look on his face when she answered his questions. 
 He looked... How? 
 Greedy. 
 Greedy? 
 There are things going on, John, that we do not understand. 
 The further North we go, the more we must watch her. 
 [SQUAWKING] 
 Ah. 
 A spy. 
 No. 
 The Witch Consul must have passed on our message. 
 Serafina's daemon. 
 So it's true. 
 The witches do have the power to send their daemons from them. 
 I have... changed much... 
 ... since last you saw me, Kaisa. 
 You have, Coram van Texel. 
 May I... introduce John Faa, king of the western Gyptians? 
 This is Kaisa, daemon of Serafina Pekkala, queen of the Lake Enara clan. 
 Serafina sends you happiness. 
 How far away is she...? And she asks if you have come to make war. 
 If it takes war... 
 ... to get our children back, then... we are ready to wage it. 
 I'd hope the witches would help. 
 Not all will. 
 Some clans are working with the Oblation Board. 
 Those who search for Dust. 
 And where are they now, these Dust hunters? 
 Four days Northeast of here. They call it The Station. 
 The witches call it Bolvangar. 
 Bolvangar? 
 Translated, that means... 
 ... "fields of evil." 
 Can you take us there? 
 Serafina Pekkala will support you in whatever route your path takes. 
 What do you think it is, Pan... 
 ... makes it look like that? 
 I don't know, but it's... it's amazing. 
 Do you think that's what Dust looks like? 
 There's something in it. 
 Not quite... 
 It looks like a city. 
 It's gone. 
 Maybe it's the alethiometer, telling us where to go, where Roger is. 
 Maybe. 
 Do you think he's cold? 
 I hope not. 
 I'm the same. 
 I find myself thinking about Billy at the strangest times. 
 Even found myself thinking about him on the toilet this morning. 
 Heard you met a bear. 
 Yeah. 
 Fun? 
 Scary? 
 Confusing. 
 Definitely not what I expected. 
 We're going to get them back, Tony. 
 I know. 
 We will do whatever it takes to get them back. 
 Hey, Lee, can we take a break? 
 We've been searching for hours. I don't think he's he... 
 Iorek Byrnison! 
 Uh... 
 It's been some time. 
 What are you doing here? 
 It hasn't been some time. 
 It's been three years. 
 [HE GROWLS] 
 Three years, long as all that? 
 It has not been a good three years. 
 We want to help, Iorek. Can we help? 
 I owe you. We both know it. 
 And how can you help me? 
 Some look good naked. You do not. 
 Who has it? 
 Your armour? 
 I am drunk, Lee! 
 And not behaving as a bear should, and I'd rather you leave me. 
 And what if I don't want to go?! 
 You know, when I see an old friend, I'm inclined to tell him where I've been, adventures I've had. 
 I have done things I can't talk about. 
 I've done some things I'm not too keen on people knowing either. 
 Tell me what you've done. 
 We wouldn't judge you, couldn't judge you. 
 And what if I deserve to be judged? 
 Don't let him go. 
 We came here just for you, Iorek! 
 Then you should leave, Lee, for I neither asked you to come, nor do I want you to stay. 
 It's not often we get customers waiting for us. 
 You haven't got that lucky, Mr Sysselman. 
 I'm not handing myself in. 
 Oh, is that right? Heh! 
 Huh! 
 How can I help? 
 I'm representing the bear. 
 The bear's case is closed. 
 Correction, I am representing myself via the bear. 
 The trouble is, you confiscated my property instead of his. 
 Yes, I doubt that, Mr Scoresby. 
 This is why I've been seeking him. 
 Now, this is a bill of sale... stating that I, not Iorek Byrnison, own his armour. 
 He lost it to me in a game of cards, you see. 
 I've come back to reclaim it. 
 The bear's armour belongs to the Magisterium. 
 Ah, yes. 
 He is paying off a blood debt. 
 Ha, well, yes, this document is correct as far as the Crime and Debt Act, chapter three, paragraph 4.5 is concerned. 
 The trouble is the Crime and Debt Act is superseded in this circumstance by the Possession of Goods Act, part three, subsection four, "miscellaneous provisions", which clearly states, and I quote, "the possession of valuables belongs to..." 
 Please... 
 Do not doubt my intelligence, Mr... 
 It's not your intelligence I doubt, Mr Sysselman. 
 Who paid you to write this and how much will it cost me for you to rewrite it? 
 Now, you be careful what you accuse me of. 
 Not even money'll work. 
 They've got you well controlled, haven't they? 
 Whatever you're accusing me of... Now, the North, as I understand it, has always been a place for people who didn't fit in or didn't want to. 
 The Magisterium has been trying to gain power out here for a generation. 
 No-one ever actually let them in. 
 Until, perhaps, now. [METAL SCRAPING WOOD] 
 Be very careful. 
 He's a bear. 
 He can't be a slave. 
 Not to you, the Magisterium or anyone. 
 Shame on you, Mr Sysselman. 
 "I believe I have been helpful 
 "in the disposal of Iorek Byrnison 
 "and helping you take your rightful throne." 
 I'm perfectly prepared. 
 "My Northern king..." 
 We're leaving? Yes. 
 The witches have agreed to help us. 
 But... But we haven't got Iorek. 
 The Witch Consul said we need Iorek. 
 He also warned there was little chance of getting him away. 
 You don't know what awaits us out there. 
 With Iorek on our side, we stand a chance. 
 Lyra, we've just had a good word that your father has been taken prisoner and is guarded by armoured bears. 
 The Magisterium are everywhere. 
 We can't dare wait. 
 They have Asriel? 
 They do. 
 Then all the more reason to have an armoured bear on our side! 
 We don't want him. 
 We made inquiries. 
 Iorek is being punished for fighting and wrecking this town. 
 He was drunk. 
 
 
 
 That's the only reason they managed to prize his armour from him. 
 He is a savage. 
 Lyra, that is not necessary! Let her do it. 
 [ALETHIOMETER CLICKS] 
 The alethiometer says that they got him drunk and tricked him. 
 No bear would normally drink spirits. 
 He tore through the police house and the bank. 
 The only reason they didn't shoot him was because of his skills with metal. 
 Why don't you check your alethiometer to see whether I'm telling the truth now? 
 You don't need to, because you know it. 
 I choose who I fight alongside, and that is my final word. 
 I heard you had a visitor. 
 What did Mrs Coulter want with you? 
 You think I can tell you that? 
 It's more than my position is worth. 
 Come now, Ratty. 
 You mistake me for someone who cares about your position. 
 Remember... 
 I know what kind of man you are. 
 Your filthy predilections. 
 And the trouble they have caused. 
 You shouldn't do this to me. 
 Hm. 
 I need an answer... 
 ... from the alethiometer. 
 I wish to know... what Grumman discovered. 
 That is a dissident. 
 That is heretical. 
 It's my job to understand heretics, is it not? 
 You ask the cardinal for his permission before demanding... 
 I'm not asking the cardinal. 
 I'm asking you, Ratty. 
 How can I get what Grumman discovered? 
 You have neither his permission nor Father McPhail's. 
 I don't need his permission! 
 I just need your consent. 
 Will you deny it? 
 Or must I... 
 ... expose you... 
 ... to the world? 
 Because I will... 
 ... out of spite... 
 ... if I don't get my own way. 
 I already thought it. 
 The question I want to ask. 
 How can I find what Grumman discovered? 
 [HE GRUNTS] 
 [DISTANT CONVERSATION] 
 Good. 
 Send me word as soon as you have something. 
 You know what, Lyra? 
 There is one person in this town who knows that bear. 
 Pan, you're a genius! 
 Hey, can you remind me why we're here again? 
 It's the only place in town with a bed and a halfway decent plate of scran. 
 It worries me that bacon is more important to you than survival. 
 And by the way, you are aware everyone is looking at us? 
 It's time to leave. Yeah, we're not leaving without Iorek. 
 Thank you. 
 They know you stole from them, Lee. 
 Every minute we spend here longer than we should... 
 Bear saved my life, Hester. And we came here to repay him, and he told us he didn't need our help. 
 Who didn't need your help? 
 You know, kid, much as I like you, now is not the time. 
 I represent John Faa, ruler of the western Gyptians, and we would like to hire you. 
 You can't afford me. 
 Mr Scoresby, the Magisterium is stealing children. 
 We have to get them back, and it occurred to us that the help of an aeronaut might be of some use. 
 We'd be grateful for your services. 
 We pay in gold. 
 I know what you're fighting, kid. 
 You're going to lose. 
 You play cards? 
 Ha! What do you know about cards? 
 I used to play them with the scholars where I lived. 
 They are much cleverer than me, but I generally won. 
 I learned that sometimes a bad hand can be your greatest weapon. 
 Sometimes, when there is no hope, it can allow you to bluff magnificently. 
 Remind me never to play cards with you. 
 We need you... and the bear. 
 You need the bear and I'm secondary. 
 How do we get him to come with us? 
 I know you know. 
 He's obliged to this town. 
 Iorek's going nowhere. 
 He's an armoured bear. 
 What could they...? 
 They got his armour. 
 Hey, you got there without needing my help. 
 Why's his armour so important? 
 War is the sea he swims in and the air he breathes. 
 No. 
 Without his armour... 
 ... his armour means as much to him as Hester here does to me. 
 His armour's like his daemon? 
 His soul is in those pieces of metal. 
 But the Magisterium will have it well hidden. 
 Now, I've been thinking that maybe I'm outgunned in this town, but I've got some craft of my own, you understand. 
 No, if I can't win Iorek's freedom, then... 
 Where did she go? 
 She's quick, and she stole my bacon. 
 Lyra, assuming this works, which is a long shot, you've still got to convince Lord Faa. 
 Just leave that to me. 
 Lyra, this way. 
 Through here. 
 [METAL SCREECHING] 
 [METAL THUMPING] 
 [BEAR GROWLS] 
 [LOW GROWLING] 
 [CLATTERING] 
 [HE GROWLS] 
 I know where your armour is, Iorek Byrnison. 
 Or at least I know how to find it. 
 How could you know where it is? 
 I... don't understand. 
 Why don't you just make some more armour out of this metal here? 
 It's worthless! 
 My armour is made of sky-iron, and it was made for me... by me. 
 I have spent months looking for it. 
 [HE GROWLS] 
 How have you found it? 
 This. 
 It tells me the truth, and I'll use it if you come with us. 
 I will come with you, but I have a right to take vengeance. 
 If they try to stop me taking my armour... 
 ... they die. 
 That seems fair. 
 But only if they try and hurt you. 
 Good. 
 Where is my armour? 
 [CLICKING] 
 It's hidden. 
 Magisterium have it hidden. 
 It's in the cellar of the oratory. 
 [HE ROARS] 
 This is not good! 
 [THUMPING AND CLATTERING] 
 He's going to tear everything apart! 
 [IOREK ROARS] 
 We've got to stop him! 
 [GROWLING] 
 Iorek! Stop! 
 [ROARING] 
 No! 
 Iorek! 
 [HE ROARS FEROCIOUSLY] 
 [DISTANT ROARING] 
 Clear the square! 
 Move! 
 All right, then, boys. 
 [SHOUTING] 
 [ROARING] 
 [SCREAMING] 
 [IOREK GROWLS] 
 Level them! 
 Fire! [IOREK GROWLS] 
 Reload! 
 [HE ROARS] 
 Reload, immediately! 
 [HE SCREAMS] 
 Stop! 
 Stop! 
 Let go of him! 
 I told you. If they fight... 
 ... they die! You owe me a debt. 
 Now you can repay it. 
 Do as I ask, don't fight these men! 
 You owe her a debt, too? 
 Damn, Iorek, you're racking up debts faster than me. 
 Heard there was some action occurring. 
 I thought I'd come see what's going on. 
 Hello again, Mr Sysselman. 
 Having fun? I hope so. 
 [HE GROANS] 
 Just turn around. 
 Walk away with me. 
 Please. 
 She's just a kid, but she talks some sense. 
 These people need our help, Iorek. Let's go give it. 
 This isn't who you are. 
 [HE ROARS] 
 [HE SIGHS] 
 We're packed up. 
 We're really going. 
 Lyra, trust me when I tell you, it's within us to beat these people. 
 Course it is, but would you mind if I brought along a little extra help all the same? 
 How did you...?! He's been mistreated and tricked, just like the Gyptians have been, always mistreated and tricked. 
 He's practically Gyptian. 
 Just like I am. 
 Lyra. 
 You cannot constantly be disobeying me. 
 I agree. Who wants a disobedient kid? 
 But she's right. 
 He's a good bear. You won't have any trouble as long as you pay him. 
 And me. 
 And who's this? 
 You told me he'd asked for me. 
 No, I told you he'd be grateful for you. 
 Yeah, I was working on him already being grateful. 
 You've entirely messed up my sales pitch. 
 What did I tell you about how I play cards? 
 Lee Scoresby. 
 I can fight and I can fly. 
 I don't come cheap and neither should I. 
 You'll get gold for gold. 
 And you are going to need all the help you can get. 
 He's an aeronaut. 
 He has his own balloon. 
 He can be useful. 
 Well, then, welcome aboard, Lee Scoresby. 
 We have a long and dangerous journey ahead. 
 Iofur? 
 [CLATTERING] 
 Iofur? 
 Iofur. 
 I appreciate the need to keep our meeting a secret, but it will be difficult if I can't see you. 
 Don't waste my time! 
 No, no, of course. 
 You... You are right. 
 You are a king, and I am impertinent. 
 I am king, and you are not a queen. 
 And we are very grateful for your... help in capturing Asriel. 
 Many have tried, and only you have succeeded. 
 And yet, I... Yet you doubt me. 
 King Raknison, I was a great help in aiding you in the disposal of Iorek Byrnison and helping you take your throne. 
 And I agreed to capture Asriel to repay my debt. 
 But he is now my prisoner in my dungeon, and I will do with him as I choose. 
 Well, perhaps, then... 
 ... as an envoy from my people... 
 ... I could offer you something that might be of worth to you. 
 And in return, you may... permit me to oversee how you deal with... 
 ... Asriel. I am a king! 
 I have all I need. 
 I'm talking... of a baptism. 
 [GROWLING] 
 Acceptance into the Magisterium. 
 Baptism. 
 King Iofur... 
 ... you are a great bear... 
 ... and the Magisterium would be stronger for having you part of it. 
 Part of us. 
 Will you walk the path with us? 
 No bears have ever been brought into the Magisterium before. 
 You would be the first bear to be baptised... 
 ... and the only. 
 But do not mistake me, the honour would be ours. 
 In return for which... 
 I will give them Asriel? 
 No, you will keep him here, but you will ensure his laboratory is destroyed and that his research into Dust is erased. 
 But I will control him. 
 I'm simply asking for you to show your loyalty to us so that we may show our loyalty to you. 
 In the meantime, I'm sure you have much to attend to. 
 How soon can this happen? 
 [SHE LAUGHS] 
 The wheels have already started turning. 
 Asriel will be controlled.
