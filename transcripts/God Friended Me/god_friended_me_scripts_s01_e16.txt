 Previously on "God Friended Me" Simon Hayes. 
  Pleasure to meet you, man. 
  I'm working on something pretty revolutionary. 
  Why would Henry run the God Account through Simon's servers? 
  Because it's Henry's way of making a point. 
  Arthur's tenure here at Harlem Episcopal might be coming to an end, and we think you would make an excellent replacement. 
  Will you go to dinner with me? 
  I'd love to. 
  [GENTLE MUSIC] 
  Wow. 
  [WAVE & ROME'S "BE MY GIRL"] 
  Clouds looking down We've got cities underneath our feet I'm touching towers I could never reach without you - Sky blue - You look great, by the way. 
  Thanks. 
  You too. 
  We would never know It's making me crazy It's a nice night. 
  Yeah. 
  Uh you hungry? 
  I'm sorry, I have no idea why I just asked that. 
  No, it's okay. 
  - And yeah. 
  - Yeah? 
  - Mm-hmm. 
  - 'Cause I was actually thinking we could check out that tapas restaurant you're always talking about. 
  I love that place. 
  But I did just go there with Parker. 
  Oh. 
  Oh, okay. 
  No, not that you can't have tapas every night of the week. 
  Oh, no, no, no, no. 
  That's-that's cool. 
  - We can go somewhere else. 
  - No, no. 
  You know, unless you want to go somewhere else. 
  Yeah, um [BOTH CHUCKLE] 
  [PHONE CHIMES] 
  Wait, the God Account just liked Zolfo & Sons. 
  It's a family-owned Italian restaurant in the Village. 
  So now the God Account's trying to help us pick a restaurant? 
  I mean, maybe. 
  Unless it's actually about a new Friend Suggestion. 
  Okay, well, why don't we cross that bridge when we come to it? 
  What do you say? 
  Italian it is. 
  [GENTLE MUSIC] 
  - Hi. 
  - Hi. 
  Welcome. 
  Do you have a reservation with us this evening? 
  No, no, but is there any chance we can get a table? 
  It's your lucky night. 
  We just had a cancellation for two. 
  [LIGHT INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC] 
  I got this. 
  Welcome to Zolfo & Sons. 
  I'm Sonny Zolfo. 
  Follow me. 
  Thanks. 
  Wow, great place, by the way. 
  Thank you. 
  Thank you very much. 
  We love it. 
  Young lady. 
  Thanks. 
  You're welcome. 
  This restaurant has been in my family for three generations. 
  My grandfather opened those doors in the late 1930s. 
  - And the menu's hardly changed. 
  - Wow. 
  When you taste the food, you're gonna know why. 
  [CHUCKLES] 
  So can I start you off with something? 
  You want oh. 
  Is this a first date? 
  How can you tell? 
  [CHUCKLES] 
  Oh, restaurant business. 
  You develop an eye for these sort of things. 
  But I promise, you came to the right place. 
  You know what, I'm gonna have the chef make a special something for you to start off with on the house. 
  - Thank you. 
  - Oh, wow, thank you. 
  You're welcome. 
  This place has a great vibe. 
  Yeah. 
  I mean, who know God liked Italian? 
  [BOTH CHUCKLE] 
  So do you think the owner is our Friend Suggestion? 
  You know, I was thinking the exact same thing. 
  But you know what, let's not worry about that. 
  Right. 
  We're off the clock. 
  Yep. 
  This place looks good. 
  Yeah. 
  [CHUCKLES] 
  Anything catch your eye? 
  Nope, nothing yet. 
  You? 
  Nope. 
  Hi, I'm Sophia. 
  Sonny told me you guys were on a first date, and rather than leave you alone, I guess he thought it would be nice to draw unwanted attention to you by having me bring you this, so Well, it looks amazing. 
  I didn't see anything like that on the menu. 
  Eh, yeah, we tend to be old-school around here. 
  If it's not covered in cheese and sauce, it's not Italian. 
  But I don't know, I thought you guys might be interested in something a little different. 
  So on your right, you have caramelized watermelon with fennel and oregano-infused sweet vinegar. 
  And on your left, you have smoked eggplant with roasted cipollinis and fresh thyme. 
  BOTH: All right. 
  Mmm. 
  That's amazing. 
  Yeah, well, I see why you're the chef. 
  Oh, well, the sous chef actually, but thank you. 
  Sophia. 
  Excuse me, folks. 
  I need you to refry the tartare di manzo for table 12 please. 
  Enjoy. 
  Thank you. 
  I thought we talked about off-menu items. 
  Service isn't the time for your personal experiments, okay? 
  Quick. 
  Destroy the evidence. 
  [PHONE CHIMES] 
  I just got a Friend Suggestion. 
  For who? 
  Sophia Zolfo. 
  Not only is she the sous chef, she's also Sonny's daughter. 
  Well, now we know why the God Account send us here. 
  [GENTLE MUSIC] 
  Well, it's nice to see I'm not the only one working late. 
  Yeah, just finishing up. 
  I just wanted to let you know that my team from Singular Dynamics is gonna be here in a few weeks. 
  So we'll be good to go. 
  - Great. 
  - Okay. 
  Is there anything I can do before they get here? 
  You know what? 
  Yeah, actually. 
  It's something that requires a certain degree of discretion, however. 
  Okay. 
  So a few months ago, someone hacked into my server farm in Palo Alto. 
  We kicked them off, but they got back in, and they keep getting in. 
  Any idea who this is? 
  Yeah, it's Henry. 
  Henry Chase, you know, the college pal I told you about. 
  Yeah. 
  Any idea what he's doing in the system? 
  He's not doing anything. 
  Really? 
  He's just sort of there, just kinda lurking around. 
  And you want me to get rid of him? 
  Your coding reminds me of Henry's. 
  If anybody can kick him out and keep him out, you know, it's you. 
  I mean, is that something you think you can do for me? 
  Sure. 
  Great. 
  [POUNDS TABLE] 
  Great. 
  Thank you. 
  But I'm gonna need unrestricted access to the system. 
  Why would you need that? 
  Henry's half as good as you say he is, I'm gonna need every advantage. 
  Yeah, I mean, if that's what you think it'll take, I trust you. 
  - Okay. 
  - All right, man. 
  [LIGHT INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC] 
  Whatever Sophia needs help with can wait till later, right? 
  - Totally. 
  - Yeah, yeah. 
  It's not like she's going anywhere. 
  Definitely. 
  [CLEARS THROAT] 
  You know, that being said, it'd be kind of irresponsible of us not to at least try and figure out what she needs help with, - considering we're here. 
  - Irresponsible, definitely. 
  I mean, no reason to be selfish with our night. 
  No, that's not us. 
  Okay, there's not much going on on her Facebook page. 
  Yeah, no recent posts. 
  Although lucky for us, we know who her dad is. 
  Hmm. 
  Oh, excuse me. 
  You ready to order? 
  You know, we aren't sure, but your daughter Sophia, she made us this amazing amuse-bouche. 
  Oh, she did, did she? 
  That's my Sophia. 
  Let me suggest the Lasagna di Carnevale. 
  My grandmother brought the recipe right over from Naples, and I'm telling you, it's the best lasagna in the city. 
  - Hey, Pop. 
  - Hi, sweetie. 
  Main rush is over, so Tony said I could take off. 
  Great, great, go ahead. 
  Thank you. 
  And thanks for coming in on your day off. 
  Look, I was just telling this beautiful couple about our lasagna. 
  Oh, right, right, right. 
  His grandmother's recipe, straight from Naples, best in the city. 
  Hey, don't knock tradition, all right. 
  It never gets old. 
  That's what kept these doors open for 80 years. 
  Yes, I know, I know. 
  But I'm late to meet Angela in Brooklyn for a drink. 
  - Love you. 
  - Love you. 
  Shoot, you know what. 
  I left my bag in the back. 
  You guys enjoy your date. 
  [CHUCKLES] 
  I'll send over your waiter. 
  - So do we follow her? 
  - Definitely. 
  [INDISTINCT CHATTER] 
  [CHUCKLES] 
  Yes. 
  Hey, Miles. 
  Good to see you. 
  Lester, it's good to see you too. 
  This is Cara Bloom. 
  This is Lester, he's the head of Harlem Episcopal Church. 
  - Nice to meet you. 
  - You as well. 
  This is Betty Hall from the diocese. 
  Have you met Reverend Carver? 
  No, I have not, but I've heard great things from my father. 
  The feeling's certainly mutual. 
  - Is he here? 
  - No, just us. 
  Okay, well, you guys have a great dinner. 
  Enjoy yourself. 
  [LIGHT MUSIC] 
  Wait. 
  I thought she told her dad she was going to Brooklyn. 
  Yeah, but she's not getting on the train or calling a car. 
  So where is she going? 
  - Hello. 
  - Hi. 
  - Here, first month's rent. 
  - Great. 
  And here are the keys. 
  Perfect. 
  Well, that explains why she lied to her dad about where she was going. 
  Yeah, looks like Zolfo & Sons is about to get some family competition. 
  [MELLOW MUSIC] 
  If Sophia lied to her dad about where she was going, then obviously she doesn't want to tell him she's opening up a restaurant. 
  Yeah, but it's right down the street from Zolfo & Sons. 
  It's gonna be kinda hard to keep it a secret. 
  Yeah, true. 
  Restaurants fail to open all the time. 
  She probably doesn't want to tell him until she absolutely has to. 
  You know who I could ask about this? 
  Parker. 
  She's "Catapult's" food blogger. 
  I mean, she knows everyone in town. 
  Maybe she can find out how close Sophia is to actually opening. 
  - Can I ask you a question? 
  - BOTH: Mm-hmm. 
  Why are you guys here? 
  Because it's a bar, and we're having a drink. 
  Yeah, but it's 9:00. 
  Aren't you guys supposed to be on a date? 
  Right, well, we were, but then we got a Friend Suggestion for the sous chef. 
  Sophia. 
  And we had to follow her. 
  I mean, we had no other choice. 
  Yeah, it would have been irresponsible. 
  Right, and and selfish. 
  - Which is not us, so - Mm-hmm. 
  So, Al, how's your new apartment? 
  What? 
  You have a new place? 
  [CHUCKLES] 
  Yeah. 
  I just moved in a few days ago. 
  I know Miles is gonna be heartbroken I'm not crashing with him anymore. 
  I'm actually showing Dad the place tomorrow. 
  You know, with Reverend Carver around now, Dad can actually get away every once in a while. 
  Oh, speaking of, we ran into him at dinner tonight with Lester and a woman from the diocese. 
  Really? 
  Without Dad? 
  Yeah, so what? 
  So you don't think it's odd that the head of the board and a member of the diocese are having dinner with Dad's assistant priest without him? 
  I'm sure it's nothing. 
  [DOOR CLOSES] 
  Ali, I need a drink, please. 
  Uh, 'sup, Rakesh? 
  Seem a little more rattled than usual. 
  Simon Hayes knows that Henry Chase is inside his server farm. 
  - Wait, how do you know? 
  - He told me. 
  I thought Henry was running the God Account - through the servers. 
  - Me too, but according to Simon, he's not running anything. 
  Do you believe him? 
  I don't know. 
  That's what I'm gonna find out. 
  Simon gave me unrestricted access to look into it, and once I find Henry inside the system, I can trace him and then find out if he's running the God Account. 
  And if he's not? 
  Then it has to be Simon. 
  Okay, well, Rakesh, he just promoted you. 
  If he finds out you've been sneaking around his system, he's gonna fire you. 
  She's right. 
  Look, I want to know who's behind the God Account as much as anyone else, - but you have to be careful. 
  - I will. 
  Wait a second, aren't you two supposed to be out on a big date? 
  [KNOCKING] 
  Hey, Dad. 
  - Hey. 
  - You ready? 
  All set. 
  Can't wait to see your new place. 
  I have some great decorating ideas. 
  Do any of them involve decorating my shelves - with brand-new dishes? 
  - [BOTH LAUGH] 
  [PHONE RINGS] 
  Reverend Finer. 
  Lester, how are you? 
  Um sure. 
  No, no. 
  No problem at all. 
  Uh, can you tell me what it's about? 
  Oh, oh, okay. 
  I'll see you then. 
  Bye. 
  Everything okay? 
  Fine, they just want me to come to a board meeting tomorrow. 
  Did Lester say why? 
  Just said that a few members of the diocese will be joining us. 
  I'm sure it's just housekeeping. 
  Miles said he ran into Andrew Carver last night. 
  - Mm-hmm. 
  - He was having dinner with Lester and a member of the diocese. 
  Do you think something's going on? 
  Like what? 
  I don't know, but shouldn't you be at a dinner like that? 
  Ali, I'm sure it was just a dinner. 
  And you really don't have any dishes? 
  [CHUCKLES] 
  So you and Miles didn't just have an awkward first date. 
  You had no date at all. 
  No, I told you, ye got a Friend Suggestion. 
  And honestly, once we left the restaurant, it was actually a really fun night. 
  You mean once you ended the date and then went back to doing what you guys always do, - you had fun. 
  - I don't get it. 
  Cara and I have always had this chemistry between us. 
  Why do things suddenly change when you add the word "date" to it? 
  Because first dates are about getting to know someone, right? 
  And you two, you're already good friends. 
  It's almost like you've been on dozens of first dates already. 
  Think about it, maybe things have always felt easy with Miles because you always had the God Account as a buffer. 
  You take it away and things get awkward. 
  Look, Miles, I know you probably don't want to hear this, but there is a chance you guys missed the last off-ramp to romance and are about to stay on the Friendship Freeway. 
  Forever. 
  First off, that is a terrible, terrible analogy. 
  And secondly, we haven't missed out on anything. 
  It was one date, Parker. 
  I'm sure it will be fine next time. 
  Can we just move on? 
  You said you made some calls about Sophia Zolfo, right? 
  Not just some calls. 
  A ton of calls. 
  She definitely is keeping her new restaurant on the down-low. 
  But she has a small investor group lined up. 
  They haven't written checks yet but that might change today. 
  What do you mean? 
  She's hosting a private lunch for them, and if it goes well, my guess is she's in business soon after. 
  Thanks. 
  Well, knowing the God Account, this isn't about helping Sophia with an investors' lunch or her new restaurant. 
  No, it's about what happens when her father finds out. 
  I remember when I recorded my first podcast. 
  How excited I was, but I was also terrified. 
  Well, I knew that once it got out there, I woulda had to explain to my dad what I was doing. 
  So what happened? 
  Well, kept putting it off. 
  He eventually found out through one of his parishioners. 
  I bet that didn't go over well. 
  We stopped talking for six months. 
  So I understand how Sophia feels. 
  I mean, it sucks to know that the one person that you want approval from is the same person who would never understand what you're trying to do. 
  You don't understand, I need to be able to cook here today. 
  I'm sorry, my hands are tied. 
  Excuse me, is there anything we can do to help? 
  Wait, you two are from the restaurant last night. 
  - Yeah, Cara. 
  - Miles. 
  What are you doing here? 
  Well, we actually came to see you. 
  I work for "Catapult," and I heard you're trying to open a new place. 
  I know you're trying to fly under the radar, but I was thinking I could write an article whenever you're ready. 
  I appreciate that. 
  Unless I can convince him to turn my gas on, there won't be a new restaurant. 
  Look, I told you, we got a report of a gas leak. 
  I gotta shut it down until we can clear it. 
  Hopefully it'll be back on by the end of the day. 
  It took me a year to line up these investors. 
  They're gonna be here in three hours, and I have no place to cook. 
  Well, have you thought about talking to your dad? 
  Maybe you can use his restaurant. 
  He doesn't understand what I want to do. 
  He'll never support it. 
  There's gotta be some way we can help. 
  I mean, unless you guys know of a place that'll let me take over its kitchen, there's nothing to do. 
  Actually, I may know a place. 
  [LIGHT MUSIC] 
  Sophia was supposed to cook for a group of investors this afternoon, but the space she had fell through. 
  Yeah, we know it's last-minute, but is there any way she could host it here? 
  Hell yes. 
  - Really? 
  - Yes. 
  Us ladies in the restaurant game gotta stick together. 
  Not to mention having a bunch of rich investors eating and drinking at Honeysuckle Rose could only be good for business. 
  - Thank you so much. 
  - Of course. 
  Kitchen's that way. 
  All right, I'll show you. 
  You're the best, you know that? 
  I do. 
  By the way - Mm-hmm? 
  - I was at Dad's office earlier, and Lester called about some meeting the diocese wants to have with him tomorrow. 
  Did he say what it was about? 
  No, he downplayed it. 
  But first, Lester has dinner with Reverend Carver and a member of the diocese without Dad, and now they want to hold a meeting? 
  Well, if Dad's not concerned, you shouldn't be concerned either. 
  When Andrew Carver first got here, I know Dad was secretly worried. 
  A young assistant priest suddenly being assigned to his church after all these years? 
  Come on, you do the math. 
  You think he's trying to replace Dad? 
  I don't know what I think. 
  Can you call Rakesh? 
  Have him do some digging into Andrew Carver? 
  - Um - Look, believe me, I want to be wrong about this. 
  Yeah, but just so you know, I tried to call him earlier, and he didn't pick up. 
  He's searching for Henry Chase, so you know how he can get. 
  There's no telling when he'll come up for air. 
  - Where are you going? 
  - The meeting's tomorrow. 
  I can't wait for Rakesh to come up for air. 
  The true judgment of our character isn't God's alone. 
  It's in the hearts and the eyes of our loved ones. 
  - We - Daddy! 
  Hey, buddy. 
  I drew a picture of you. 
  - Wow. 
  - He had to come show you. 
  Ah, I love it. 
  [CHUCKLES] 
  - Andrew. 
  - Arthur. 
  You remember Caroline? 
  Yeah, good to see you again. 
  This is my son, Marcus. 
  I remember when my kids used to run around here. 
  [GASPS] 
  You know what, Marcus? 
  There is a balcony up there. 
  It was my son's favorite spot to see the whole church from. 
  Hmm? 
  Go ahead. 
  [BOTH CHUCKLE] 
  - You have a wonderful family. 
  - Oh, thank you. 
  The more time we spend here, the more it feels like home. 
  Glad to hear it. 
  Oh, and by the way, I heard that you ran into Miles at dinner last night. 
  Yes, I did, it was great to finally meet him. 
  And you were with Lester? 
  That's right, we were having dinner - with a member of the diocese. 
  - Uh-huh. 
  He thought I should get to know them better. 
  Sorry I didn't mention it. 
  Oh, no problem. 
  Listen, why don't you get back to your sermon. 
  [GENTLE MUSIC] 
  My two new pasta dishes. 
  Chestnut tortelli with lavender nutmeg, and pachadi con giardiniera. 
  Hmm. 
  Oh, my this is insanely good. 
  I mean, the flavors are like perfectly balanced. 
  And the presentation is Oh, sorry. 
  I watch a lot of "Top Chef. 
  " [ALL CHUCKLE] 
  Where did you learn to cook like this? 
  - Uh, honestly, my dad. 
  - Really? 
  I mean, it doesn't really look like his kind of food. 
  No, it's not, but, um, I don't know, I guess just growing up in restaurants and being in the kitchen with him, seeing his love of food and cooking, it inspired me to become a chef. 
  Oh, does he know about that? 
  You should tell him what you're doing. 
  I will, I just want to make sure the restaurant is up and on its feet before I have that conversation. 
  Sophia? 
  Are you here? 
  I think that's that's him. 
  I don't understand. 
  How did he know I was here? 
  Sophia? 
  So it's true? 
  Did you really think you would be able to hide this from me? 
  Dad, I'm sorry. 
  I was gonna tell you. 
  Tell me what? 
  Tell me that you were gonna open your own restaurant? 
  Or that you're turning your back on the one that's been in your family for three generations? 
  Turning your back on me? 
  - Me? 
  - Yeah. 
  What about you? 
  I asked you for a chance to run the kitchen before you hired Tony. 
  You wouldn't even give me a chance. 
  You said you wanted to change the menu. 
  You wanted to make it something that it wasn't. 
  No, I wanted to show you what I could do. 
  And yeah, maybe bring something special to the restaurant. 
  The restaurant has always been special, Sophia. 
  That's the problem. 
  You could never see that. 
  No, you never saw me as a real chef, which is a shame because when I open up my own spot, the rest of the city will see that, and maybe you will too. 
  It takes more than creating new dishes to run a new restaurant, sweetie. 
  Look, there's pitfalls you're just not ready for. 
  We done here? 
  'Cause I'm expecting investors soon, and I gotta get back to work. 
  I guess we are. 
  [SOMBER MUSIC] 
  Sophia, I'm so sorry. 
  - Are you okay? 
  - Fine. 
  Look, I know what it's like to have a blowout like that with your dad, for him not to understand what you're trying to do, but trust me, he will. 
  But you have to keep going. 
  And I know right now you may feel alone, but you're not. 
  We're here. 
  He's right. 
  You can do this, and we're gonna make sure of it. 
  Thanks. 
  [SIGHS] 
  Rakesh. 
  Ali, what what are you doing here? 
  Sorry to invade your workspace, but Miles told me you were in the zone and might not be returning calls. 
  Yeah, I'm kind of in the thick of it. 
  I'm trying to track Henry through the servers. 
  Okay, then I'll make it quick. 
  Look, I think the church might be trying to have my dad replaced. 
  Yeah, is there any way you can look into his assistant priest, Andrew Carver? 
  Yeah, yeah, shouldn't be a problem. 
  Thank you. 
  [COMPUTER BEEPS] 
  Wait, this can't be right. 
  What is it? 
  Henry's not running code, but he's not just lurking around either. 
  I think he's trying to gain access into a specific server in the cluster. 
  - - [COMPUTER BEEPING] 
  Wait a minute, I thought you had some sort of unrestricted access to everything. 
  So did I. 
  I mean, this has to be where Simon Hayes parked the top-secret project. 
  Wait, what is Henry doing? 
  Oh, no. 
  Oh, no. 
  Oh, no. 
  - I need to talk to Simon. 
  - Okay. 
  Um, I'll look into your priest as soon as I can. 
  No problem. 
  [ELEVATOR DINGS] 
  Simon. 
  Simon? 
  We have a big problem. 
  [GENTLE MUSIC] 
  Okay. 
  All right, Henry, if this is how you want to play it, you leave me no choice. 
  Let's see how you like hypertext transfer protocol application layer filtering frozen system-wide, mandatory access control to slow down input packets. 
  Rakesh, what the hell are you doing? 
  - Not now. 
  - Get the hell away from my computer, or I'm calling security. 
  I don't think you want me to do that. 
  Henry's trying to break into my private server. 
  No, I think he knows he can't break in. 
  - But what he can do is - Launch a virus. 
  Take down the entire system. 
  Yeah, and destroy your top-secret project right along with it. 
  I think he realized I was tracking him inside the server and decided to attack. 
  I just need to sandbox your private server so Right, right, take the entire system offline. 
  Good, genius. 
  [TENSE MUSIC] 
  [SIGHS] 
  I think we need to talk. 
  [LIGHT MUSIC] 
 
 
 
  Sophia looks like the real deal. 
  Yeah. 
  You know, after what happened with her and her father, I really hope this works out. 
  Look, that's for covering this, Parker. 
  Hopefully some good press will go a long way for her place. 
  Yeah, no problem. 
  Thanks. 
  All right, last dish has been served. 
  All right, looks like you got some happy investors. 
  Sophia. 
  Will, thank you so much for coming. 
  The food was excellent. 
  So why do I feel like you've got bad news? 
  That was my assistant on the phone. 
  Your liquor license didn't go through. 
  I filed all the paperwork myself. 
  I mean, there must be some mistake. 
  If there was, it was on your end. 
  Will, just let me figure this out. 
  Whatever it is, I can fix it. 
  Sophia, we took a risk when no one else would, but a mistake like this raises serious concerns about your ability to run a restaurant. 
  You are clearly a talented chef, but, I'm sorry, we have to pass. 
  [SOMBER MUSIC] 
  This makes no sense. 
  I mean, I went over every permit a dozen times, especially the liquor license. 
  Al, do you know anyone on the liquor board you could talk to? 
  Maybe there's something we could do. 
  Yeah, actually I do. 
  I know someone over there. 
  I'm happy to give them a call. 
  - Thank you. 
  - Yeah. 
  But even if we get this straightened out, I mean, I have no investors. 
  Well, then we'll find new ones. 
  I sunk everything I had into the first month's rent to hold the space. 
  If I lose it, I have to start all over. 
  I can't believe my father might actually have been right. 
  No, no, he wasn't. 
  Okay, you can't give up. 
  You're right. 
  You know what, I'm gonna go back to my restaurant, and I'm gonna make some phone calls. 
  There's gotta be somebody out there that's willing to take a chance on me. 
  I'll be in touch. 
  Thanks. 
  [BELL JINGLES] 
  Okay, I'm gonna call my friend on the liquor board. 
  What's your next step? 
  [PHONE BUZZES, CHIMES] 
  - - Maybe the God Account just sent us one. 
  LadurÃ©e Macaroons in SoHo? 
  Well, I love that place. 
  Let's go check it out. 
  I don't understand. 
  Why would Henry want to destroy your work? 
  You ever hear of, uh, J. J. Thomson? 
  No. 
  Why? 
  He's credited with discovering the electron. 
  His breakthrough changed the course of history, but it was Thomas Edison who ushered us into the modern age of electronics, who saw the potential to light the world in a way that Thomson just never could. 
  And in this story, you're Edison and Henry's Thomson? 
  Look, Henry is the brightest mind I've ever known, capable of changing the world, but like most geniuses he fell in love with creation. 
  Not application. 
  I saw the potential in predictive analytics, but our initial algorithms barely scratched the surface. 
  In order to reach its true potential, we needed to hire coders and build an infrastructure. 
  You needed to create Singular Dynamics. 
  Yes, in order to ensure that our vision was protected. 
  And Henry thought you were selling out. 
  [CHUCKLING] 
  I mean, in Henry's mind, I was I was somehow betraying everything we set out to do. 
  You know, he vowed never to work with me again, and then he just disappeared. 
  That was ten years ago. 
  You know, when, um when Henry left, I yeah, I just I didn't just lose a partner. 
  I lost my best friend. 
  So why come back to sabotage you now? 
  Because I'm on the verge of changing the world in a way that he never could, and he can't face it. 
  He can't admit the fact that I'm about to fulfill the dream that he walked away from, so he'd rather destroy it. 
  And I need you to help me prevent that from happening. 
  Can I count on you? 
  [SMOOTH MUSIC] 
  Yeah, it's so crazy. 
  I was just craving LadurÃ©e the other day. 
  Oh, why does that not surprise me? 
  Well, not just because I love macaroons, which I do, but I like to come here when I'm feeling nostalgic. 
  For what? 
  Oh, in college, I studied abroad in Paris. 
  It was my first time out of the country. 
  I was 4,000 miles away, and yet I never felt more at home. 
  On Sundays, I would grab a coffee and a macaroon and stroll down the Champs-lysÃ©es to the Arc de Triomphe. 
  It was the best time of my life. 
  You know, it's a dream of mine to move to Paris one day. 
  Okay, you have never told me this. 
  See, why couldn't we talk about stuff like this on our date last night? 
  I don't know. 
  What happened? 
  I have no idea. 
  I guess we just weren't being ourselves. 
  Yeah. 
  Wait. 
  Hey, isn't that the guy from the gas company? 
  Yeah. 
  Wait, that can't be a coincidence. 
  Hey, uh, excuse me, excuse me. 
  Do you remember us from our friend's restaurant? 
  Oh, yeah, that's right. 
  Hey, did your friend ever find a place to cook her lunch? 
  - She did. 
  - Oh, that's great. 
  I'm glad it worked out. 
  You know, I felt bad, especially when I found out that there was no gas leak. 
  What do you mean? 
  Yeah, somebody called in claiming they smelled gas, so we had to shut it down, but it all checked out. 
  Any idea who made the call? 
  Nah, it was an anonymous tip. 
  Have a good one. 
  Wait, so someone makes an anonymous call to get her gas turned off, and then the paperwork for her liquor license falls through? 
  Miles, what if that's why the God Account send us here, because someone's sabotaging her? 
  Maybe that someone feels betrayed she's leaving the family business. 
  What, Sonny? 
  You think her own father would do that to her? 
  I don't know, but if he did and Sophia finds out, that could end their relationship for good. 
  - I was thinking about it. 
  - What's the name? 
  - Uh - Hey, we need to talk. 
  You two again? 
  Look, if this is about my daughter, there's nothing to talk about. 
  Actually, there is. 
  Someone had Sophia's liquor license pulled so she wasn't able to open up her restaurant. 
  You think I had something to do with her license being pulled? 
  We did. 
  But then my sister talked to her friend on the liquor board, and it turns out it wasn't you. 
  It was him. 
  What? 
  Sonny, I I don't know what they're talking about. 
  How did you find out Sophia was cooking at my sister's restaurant? 
  My guess is he told you. 
  Yeah, that's right, that's right. 
  Tony? 
  Okay, fine, I know the woman she signed a lease with, and when I found out, I had her liquor license held up. 
  Why the hell did you do that? 
  You don't get it, Sonny. 
  You never have. 
  - Don't get what? 
  - How talented she is. 
  You just see her as your little girl, but if her restaurant turns out half as good as she is, it'll cripple us. 
  I wasn't gonna just sit back and let it happen. 
  It was business. 
  It wasn't personal. 
  It wasn't personal? 
  Wasn't personal? 
  This business has always been personal. 
  It's about my family. 
  And I just turned my back on her. 
  Look, this isn't gonna happen again. 
  - Tony, you're fired. 
  - Sonny We're done here. 
  I have to find my daughter. 
  I have to figure out a way to make this right. 
  Actually, I think we can help with that. 
  [PHONE BUZZES] 
  Rakesh, how'd things go with Simon? 
  Fine, but listen, finally got to dig into Andrew Carver for you. 
  Did you find anything? 
  Uh, you could say that, yeah. 
  I found an email from the board of Harlem Episcopal to the New York Diocese, and it turns out Andrew Carver wasn't assigned to the church like they told your dad. 
  The board requested him. 
  They lied. 
  I think you were right, Ali. 
  Um They're replacing your dad. 
  I can't believe Tony would sabotage me like that. 
  He told your dad that he had to. 
  That he knew how talented you were, even if Sonny couldn't see it. 
  He said that? 
  He did. 
  Right before your dad fired him. 
  Well, it's too bad the damage is done, right? 
  Then undo it. 
  My sister's friend on the liquor board is putting your license through as we speak. 
  That's amazing. 
  But, I mean, for the past 24 hours, I've been on the phone begging everyone I know to invest, and no one will take a chance on me. 
  Actually, there is one person. 
  [DOOR OPENS] 
  [GENTLE MUSIC] 
  Dad? 
  Hello, sweetheart. 
  I thought I'd come down and take a look at your new place. 
  Yeah, well, not for much longer. 
  I know that. 
  So then what are you doing here? 
  Well, remember when you were growing up, we had that little stepladder in the kitchen of the restaurant. 
  You'd use it to get to the pasta maker 'cause you used to like to crank the roller, remember? 
  Yeah, and you used to quiz me on the thickness of the different pastas as you pushed the dough through. 
  That's right. 
  Well, I just realized that, um, I never let you off that little ladder, and I am so, so sorry that I couldn't see you for the amazing chef that you truly are, and I know I know I'm stuck in the past, but that's why we have kids. 
  So they they pull us into the future. 
  So what do you say? 
  Look, Dad, I do not want to be a chef at Zolfo & Sons. 
  I'm sorry, that is it's just not me. 
  I know that. 
  That's why I'm selling the restaurant. 
  - What? 
  - Don't worry, your mother's been begging me to retire anyway. 
  What are you talking about? 
  I want you to use the money to open your own place. 
  Think of me as your angel investor. 
  I can't believe you did that. 
  Dad, that restaurant means everything to you. 
  No, sweetie, no. 
  You are everything to me. 
  I just needed a good kick in the ass to remember that. 
  I love you. 
  Hey, hey, you two. 
  We're having a celebration tomorrow. 
  I expect you're both gonna be there, okay? 
  Absolutely. 
  Thank you both for everything. 
  [PHONE BUZZES] 
  Hey. 
  Hey, Ali, what's up? 
  I'm so sorry I didn't listen to you earlier. 
  It's okay, all that matters is we tell Dad before he's blindsided. 
  Ali, Miles, can I help you? 
  Is something wrong? 
  We know you're trying to take Harlem Episcopal from our dad. 
  I don't know what you heard, but this is not what you think. 
  Okay, then explain it to us. 
  Miles, Ali, what are you doing here? 
  I think you need to ask Reverend Carver about that. 
  Andrew? 
  I haven't been totally honest about my reasons for being here. 
  Lester and the board requested that I come to Harlem Episcopal to replace you as head priest. 
  I'm, uh I'm being pushed out, is that it? 
  No, of course not. 
  The diocese holds you in the highest regard. 
  I don't understand. 
  Arthur, they're nominating you to become Bishop of New York. 
  [GENTLE MUSIC] 
  Whoa, so so that's what the board meeting's about? 
  Yes, discussing the next steps in your father's transition. 
  Wait, Dad, that is great. 
  [EXHALES] 
  I don't know what to say. 
  I mean, why all the intrigue? 
  Why not just tell me the truth from the beginning? 
  The board knows how deeply you care about Harlem Episcopal, that you'd be unwilling to leave it in someone else's hands unless you felt comfortable with that person. 
  And that's why you're here, gave me the chance to get to know you. 
  And hopefully show you that this church, your church, is in good hands if you decide to move on. 
  I'm sorry you had to find out like this, but your children are obviously very protective of you. 
  - Damn straight, we are. 
  - [LAUGHTER] 
  Get over here, Dad. 
  [LAUGHTER] 
  Ohh. 
  [MELLOW MUSIC] 
  It's easy to think of new beginnings as something that just happens when the time is right. 
  Life's way of wiping the slate clean to allow us to change course. 
  But the truth is, new beginnings are never easy. 
  They usually remind us of where we've been as much as where we're headed, what we have to sacrifice and leave behind if we choose to continue on. 
  Hey, I just wanted to let you know that your servers are back online. 
  You won't have to worry about Henry poking around anymore. 
  Okay. 
  Thank you, man. 
  Yeah. 
  I think we can officially take Henry Chase off the table. 
  Simon Hayes is our main suspect now. 
  So you really think the top-secret project he's been working on is the God Account? 
  What else could it be? 
  Well, we could just wait for his team to get here, hope they show you the account when he's ready. 
  No, I'm not sure he's going to, not unless we force his hand. 
  Well, how do we force it? 
  You've said it from the beginning, Miles. 
  You weren't chosen at random. 
  Just need to find the connection between you and Simon Hayes. 
  And is there a point in the journey where it's simply too late to change course even if you wanted to? 
  Happy are you happy Hey, what are you up to? 
  Just sitting here. 
  You? 
  Actually, I could use some advice. 
  What's on your mind? 
  - It's about me and Cara. 
  - Mm-hmm. 
  We have always had this great chemistry, but when we went on a date, it just vanished. 
  - Uh-huh. 
  - And I'm not sure why. 
  Well, you know, in my experience, there's a difference between chemistry and spark. 
  Chemistry is that easy feeling you have with someone that grows over time. 
  Spark Spark you just have. 
  It takes over on its own. 
  And if it doesn't? 
  Then it never will. 
  'Cause I've been dreaming out you Love me in the morning, love me In the end, maybe trying to change course is more about realizing you never needed to, and that's okay. 
  I am so glad everything worked out for Sophia. 
  Yeah, me too. 
  I mean, after her investors left, I thought she might have missed her window. 
  Hey, do you think that's what happened to us? 
  Like we missed our window? 
  I don't know, maybe, but you know, if we did, I'm okay with it. 
  You are? 
  Well I just mean having you come into my life, having you as a friend, it's like one of the best things that's ever happened to me. 
  I wouldn't want to change any of it. 
  Happy are you happy Neither would I. 
  So friends? 
  Friends. 
  I believe in us, I believe in us [INDISTINCT CHATTER] 
  - Hey. 
  - Hey. 
  So glad you guys could make it. 
  Oh, my God, of course. 
  We would not miss this. 
  - You ready to make your mark? 
  - Absolutely. 
  Excuse me, please. 
  Can I have your attention for a second? 
  Thank you, thank you. 
  First of all, thank you all for coming. 
  And on behalf of the Zolfo family, I would like to invite you to our newest venture, and it's gonna be open in about six months, and it's gonna be an amazing Italian restaurant, and I know the whole town's gonna be buzzing about it. 
  And it's going to be called Sophia's. 
  [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] 
  [DEAN MARTIN'S "THAT'S AMORE" PLAYS] 
  Cheers. 
  Please, everybody stand up, stand up. 
  As you know, we have this tradition here at Zolfo & Sons that when Dean plays through those speakers, you give a little kiss to the person you came with or a big one. 
  Here we go. 
  When the moon hits your eye Oh, come on, you two. 
  You have to kiss or it's bad luck. 
  That's amore When the world seems to shine What's one kiss between friends? 
  Right. 
  Who wants bad luck? 
  'Scuzza me, but you see Back in old Napoli that's amore When the moon hits your eye Like a big pizza pie That's amore That's amore When the world seems to shine Like you've had too much wine That's amore Amore That's amore
