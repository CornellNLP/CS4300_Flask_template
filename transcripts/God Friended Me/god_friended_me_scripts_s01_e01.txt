 New York City. 
 Center of the universe. 
 Home to.  million people. 
 A diverse melting pot of culture. 
 Everyone searching for meaning and answers. 
 I thought I had it all figured out. 
 But then, something happened,   and it changed my life forever. 
 There is no proof of God anywhere in the universe. 
 We will debate that and more on today's episode    of "The Millennial Prophet."     
 I am your host, Miles Finer,    reminding you that there is no God, and that is okay. 
 My guest today is an old NYU friend,    one of my favorite people. 
 Ladies and gentleman, welcome to the podcast    Rabbi Zoe Schwartz. 
 Thank you so much for having me, Miles. 
 But per usual, you're misinformed. 
 There is proof of God in the Torah. 
 The miracles of Sinai, for instance. 
 You grew up in the church. 
 You know this better than anyone. 
 Yes, it's true, my father's a reverend. 
 We got the whole Luke/Vader dynamic going on. 
 But be honest,    if I told you that God sent me a message    in the form a burning bush,    you would think I was insane. 
 - Not necessarily. 
 - Oh, come on, Zoe. 
 - What? 
 - I understand that    it is comforting to believe    that there is someone watching over us,    but there is no external force    that's going to reach out and solve our problems. 
 - What happened to you, Miles? 
 - Nothing. 
 I just want to help people    take responsibility for their own lives. 
 I think we would all be better off if we did. 
 Hi, Eric. 
 It's Miles Finer    I was just calling to see if you had an opportunity    to listen to my podcast. 
 I think it would be perfect for Sirius. 
 Um, you have my phone number, and my email. 
 So... 
 yeah.

 Hey, man, I checked out your podcast, bro. 
 It's dope. 
 You making a living doing that? 
 Yeah, yeah. 
 I got a ton of listeners, you know? 
 Advertising dollars are really rolling in. 
 I feel like I'm making a difference. 
 And when is the last time    you saw your credit card, Mr. Johnson? 
 Well, the only way I can track it is if they use it. 
 Yes, it does have a chip. 
 What am I good for? 
 Um... 
 You know, I've been asking myself that    a lot actually, lately. 
 Um, I th... 
 Hello? 
 Hello? 
 Do you know how many people are on the planet, Miles? 
 - Uh... 
 - Roughly   billion, okay? 
 You know what the chances are    of finding that one right person for you? 
 Your mom set you up on another date? 
 Yeah, she's obsessed, man. 
 She's trying to find me a soul mate again. 
 I'm like, hello, there's no such thing,    and she doesn't care, she just like    "You have a karmic destiny, Rakesh. 
 You're to marry an Indian girl."    I'm like, why can't you just let me be miserable

 Yo, Eric from Sirius just emailed me! 
 Amazing! 
 Who's that? 
 He's the guy that runs that podcast channel. 
 I sent him my show, and, apparently, he dug it,    and he wants me to submit a presentation    by Friday to see where it's headed. 
 Miles, you're about to blow up. 
 Mm-hmm. 
 [LAUGHS] 
 You think you'll get to meet Howard Stern? 
 Probably not. 
 Congrats on the podcast, big bro. 
 I know you're not down with the message,    but your support means everything. 
 - Mm, that's good to know. 
 - Mm? 
 'Cause I want you to do me a favor. 
 - Yeah, anything. 
 - Anything? 
 - Yeah, what's up? 
 - I want you to come to Dad's      
 -   th at the church this Sunday. 
 - Anything but that. 
 The two of you haven't spoken in months. 
 Come on, this is the perfect opportunity     for you two to start talking again. 
 Why do I have to take the first step? 
 If Dad wanted me there, he would have invited me. 
 Of course Dad wants you there. 
 You know every Sunday after church,      
 - he goes to St. Nicholas park. 
 - So he goes to play chess. 
 He goes there because that's where     the two of you used to play. 
 Look, Miles, what is it going to take     to bring the two of you back together?

 Uh, yeah, yeah. 
 I love it up here. 
 Your roommate told me that you were up here. 
 Hey, sorry for running out last night. 
 I was just stressed about work. 
 Look, I know the nurse in the photo is your mom. 
 She left when you were a kid, right? 
 That's who you were waiting for on the bench? 
 Uh, I don't... 
 I don't really want to talk about this. 
 Come on, your mom and my mom were in the same photo. 
 What are the odds? 
 That must be the reason why they sent me your name.

 - They want me to help you

 - Miles, you're wrong. 
 - How can you say that? 
 - Because I already found her. 
 [TENSE MUSIC] 
 When? 
 Six weeks ago. 
 On the subway. 
 She was sitting right across from me. 
 ♪ ♪     Um... 
 Look, you were right. 
 My mom did leave when I was seven. 
 And then, a couple months later,     she came back,     and she told my dad that she'd gotten sober. 
 But then, a few months after that, she left for good. 
 All I knew was that she came to New York,     so after college, I came here looking for her. 
 But nothing ever came of it until I saw her that day. 
 - What did you say to her? 
 - Nothing. 
 Nothing, I just... 
 I froze. 
 And when she got off the train, I... 
 I followed her to St. 
 Vincent's Park,     and I sat there, watching her. 
 I don't know, I guess I... 
 I thought I would work up the nerve     to say something to her, but I didn't. 
 And I have gone back pretty much every day since     at the exact same time,     and I sit on the exact same bench,     but every time... 
 I lose my nerve. 
 And ever since I saw her,     I can't... 
 I can't sleep, I can't write. 
 But don't you see? 
 That's why you     have to go talk to her. 
 Things won't get better unless you do. 
 Why do you even care? 
 You're just trying to figure out who's behind all of this. 
 That's not true.

 ♪ ♪     You asked me why I don't believe in God. 
 When... 
 when I was eight,     my mother was diagnosed with breast cancer,     and the doctor said she had six months to live. 
 And so I prayed for a miracle, and then it happened. 
 She went into full remission. 
 The doctors couldn't even explain it. 
 I don't understand. 
 If God answered your prayers,     why don't you believe? 
 Because on the way home from the hospital,     she died in a car accident. 
 Miles. 
 I am so sorry. 
 I tried to make sense of it,     and the only way I could     was that there was no God. 
 Because if there was, that means that he is cruel,     and I don't want to live in a world     governed by someone like that. 
 [SOFT MUSIC] 
 Look, I don't know who's behind this,     or why they chose me. 
 But I do know that your mom is still out there,     and you can still have a relationship with her.

 Yeah, but what if she wants nothing to do with me?
